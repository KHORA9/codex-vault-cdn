That is, of course, a matter\r\nof taste. For my own part, I like my science and my champagne as dry as\r\nI can get them. But the public thinks otherwise. So I have ventured to\r\nsweeten accompanying samples as far as possible to suit the demand, and\r\ntrust they will meet with the approbation of consumers.\r\n\r\nOf the specimens here selected for exhibition, my title piece originally\r\nappeared in the _Fortnightly Review_: 'Honey Dew' and 'The First Potter'\r\nwere contributions to _Longman's Magazine_: and all the rest found\r\nfriendly shelter between the familiar yellow covers of the good old\r\n_Cornhill_. My thanks are due to the proprietors and editors of those\r\nvarious periodicals for kind permission to reproduce them here.\r\n\r\nG.A.\r\n\r\nTHE NOOK, DORKING:\r\n\r\n_September_, 1889.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                         PAGE\r\n\r\nFALLING IN LOVE             1\r\nRIGHT AND LEFT             18\r\nEVOLUTION                  31\r\nSTRICTLY INCOG.            50\r\nSEVEN-YEAR SLEEPERS        72\r\nA FOSSIL CONTINENT         88\r\nA VERY OLD MASTER         106\r\nBRITISH AND FOREIGN       123\r\nTHUNDERBOLTS              137\r\nHONEY-DEW                 159\r\nTHE MILK IN THE COCO-NUT  176\r\nFOOD AND FEEDING          193\r\nDE BANANA                 216\r\nGO TO THE ANT             233\r\nBIG ANIMALS               251\r\nFOSSIL FOOD               271\r\nOGBURY BARROWS            287\r\nFISH OUT OF WATER         302\r\nTHE FIRST POTTER          316\r\nTHE RECIPE FOR GENIUS     328\r\nDESERT SANDS              341\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFALLING IN LOVE\r\n\r\n\r\nAn ancient and famous human institution is in pressing danger. Sir\r\nGeorge Campbell has set his face against the time-honoured practice of\r\nFalling in Love. Parents innumerable, it is true, have set their faces\r\nagainst it already from immemorial antiquity; but then they only\r\nattacked the particular instance, without venturing to impugn the\r\ninstitution itself on general principles. An old Indian administrator,\r\nhowever, goes to work in all things on a different pattern. He would\r\nalways like to regulate human life generally as a department of the\r\nIndia Office; and so Sir George Campbell would fain have husbands and\r\nwives selected for one another (perhaps on Dr. Johnson's principle, by\r\nthe Lord Chancellor) with a view to the future development of the race,\r\nin the process which he not very felicitously or elegantly describes as\r\n'man-breeding.' 'Probably,' he says, as reported in _Nature_, 'we have\r\nenough physiological knowledge to effect a vast improvement in the\r\npairing of individuals of the same or allied races if we could only\r\napply that knowledge to make fitting marriages, instead of giving way to\r\nfoolish ideas about love and the tastes of young people, whom we can\r\nhardly trust to choose their own bonnets, much less to choose in a\r\ngraver matter in which they are most likely to be influenced by\r\nfrivolous prejudices.' He wants us, in other words, to discard the\r\ndeep-seated inner physiological promptings of inherited instinct, and to\r\nsubstitute for them some calm and dispassionate but artificial\r\nselection of a fitting partner as the father or mother of future\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\nNow this is of course a serious subject, and it ought to be treated\r\nseriously and reverently. But, it seems to me, Sir George Campbell's\r\nconclusion is exactly the opposite one from the conclusion now being\r\nforced upon men of science by a study of the biological and\r\npsychological elements in this very complex problem of heredity. So far\r\nfrom considering love as a 'foolish idea,' opposed to the best interests\r\nof the race, I believe most competent physiologists and psychologists,\r\nespecially those of the modern evolutionary school, would regard it\r\nrather as an essentially beneficent and conservative instinct developed\r\nand maintained in us by natural causes, for the very purpose of insuring\r\njust those precise advantages and improvements which Sir George Campbell\r\nthinks he could himself effect by a conscious and deliberate process of\r\nselection. More than that, I believe, for my own part (and I feel sure\r\nmost evolutionists would cordially agree with me), that this beneficent\r\ninherited instinct of Falling in Love effects the object it has in view\r\nfar more admirably, subtly, and satisfactorily, on the average of\r\ninstances, than any clumsy human selective substitute could possibly\r\neffect it.\r\n\r\nIn short, my doctrine is simply the old-fashioned and confiding belief\r\nthat marriages are made in heaven: with the further corollary that\r\nheaven manages them, one time with another, a great deal better than Sir\r\nGeorge Campbell.\r\n\r\nLet us first look how Falling in Love affects the standard of human\r\nefficiency; and then let us consider what would be the probable result\r\nof any definite conscious attempt to substitute for it some more\r\ndeliberate external agency.\r\n\r\nFalling in Love, as modern biology teaches us to believe, is nothing\r\nmore than the latest, highest, and most involved exemplification, in the\r\nhuman race, of that almost universal selective process which Mr. Darwin\r\nhas enabled us to recognise throughout the whole long series of the\r\nanimal kingdom. The butterfly that circles and eddies in his aërial\r\ndance around his observant mate is endeavouring to charm her by the\r\ndelicacy of his colouring, and to overcome her coyness by the display of\r\nhis skill. The peacock that struts about in imperial pride under the\r\neyes of his attentive hens, is really contributing to the future beauty\r\nand strength of his race by collecting to himself a harem through whom\r\nhe hands down to posterity the valuable qualities which have gained the\r\nadmiration of his mates in his own person. Mr. Wallace has shown that to\r\nbe beautiful is to be efficient; and sexual selection is thus, as it\r\nwere, a mere lateral form of natural selection--a survival of the\r\nfittest in the guise of mutual attractiveness and mutual adaptability,\r\nproducing on the average a maximum of the best properties of the race in\r\nthe resulting offspring. I need not dwell here upon this aspect of the\r\ncase, because it is one with which, since the publication of the\r\n'Descent of Man,' all the world has been sufficiently familiar.\r\n\r\nIn our own species, the selective process is marked by all the features\r\ncommon to selection throughout the whole animal kingdom; but it is also,\r\nas might be expected, far more specialised, far more individualised, far\r\nmore cognisant of personal traits and minor peculiarities. It is\r\nfurthermore exerted to a far greater extent upon mental and moral as\r\nwell as physical peculiarities in the individual.\r\n\r\nWe cannot fall in love with everybody alike. Some of us fall in love\r\nwith one person, some with another. This instinctive and deep-seated\r\ndifferential feeling we may regard as the outcome of complementary\r\nfeatures, mental, moral, or physical, in the two persons concerned; and\r\nexperience shows us that, in nine cases out of ten, it is a reciprocal\r\naffection, that is to say, in other words, an affection roused in unison\r\nby varying qualities in the respective individuals.\r\n\r\nOf its eminently conservative and even upward tendency very little doubt\r\ncan be reasonably entertained. We _do_ fall in love, taking us in the\r\nlump, with the young, the beautiful, the strong, and the healthy; we do\r\n_not_ fall in love, taking us in the lump, with the aged, the ugly, the\r\nfeeble, and the sickly. The prohibition of the Church is scarcely needed\r\nto prevent a man from marrying his grandmother. Moralists have always\r\nborne a special grudge to pretty faces; but, as Mr. Herbert Spencer\r\nadmirably put it (long before the appearance of Darwin's selective\r\ntheory), 'the saying that beauty is but skin-deep is itself but a\r\nskin-deep saying.' In reality, beauty is one of the very best guides we\r\ncan possibly have to the desirability, so far as race-preservation is\r\nconcerned, of any man or any woman as a partner in marriage. A fine\r\nform, a good figure, a beautiful bust, a round arm and neck, a fresh\r\ncomplexion, a lovely face, are all outward and visible signs of the\r\nphysical qualities that on the whole conspire to make up a healthy and\r\nvigorous wife and mother; they imply soundness, fertility, a good\r\ncirculation, a good digestion. Conversely, sallowness and paleness are\r\nroughly indicative of dyspepsia and anæmia; a flat chest is a symptom of\r\ndeficient maternity; and what we call a bad figure is really, in one way\r\nor another, an unhealthy departure from the central norma and standard\r\nof the race. Good teeth mean good deglutition; a clear eye means an\r\nactive liver; scrubbiness and undersizedness mean feeble virility. Nor\r\nare indications of mental and moral efficiency by any means wanting as\r\nrecognised elements in personal beauty. A good-humoured face is in\r\nitself almost pretty. A pleasant smile half redeems unattractive\r\nfeatures. Low, receding foreheads strike us unfavourably. Heavy, stolid,\r\nhalf-idiotic countenances can never be beautiful, however regular their\r\nlines and contours. Intelligence and goodness are almost as necessary as\r\nhealth and vigour in order to make up our perfect ideal of a beautiful\r\nhuman face and figure. The Apollo Belvedere is no fool; the murderers in\r\nthe Chamber of Horrors at Madame Tussaud's are for the most part no\r\nbeauties.\r\n\r\nWhat we all fall in love with, then, as a race, is in most cases\r\nefficiency and ability. What we each fall in love with individually is,\r\nI believe, our moral, mental, and physical complement. Not our like, not\r\nour counterpart; quite the contrary; within healthy limits, our unlike\r\nand our opposite. That this is so has long been more or less a\r\ncommonplace of ordinary conversation; that it is scientifically true,\r\none time with another, when we take an extended range of cases, may, I\r\nthink, be almost demonstrated by sure and certain warranty of human\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nBrothers and sisters have more in common, mentally and physically, than\r\nany other members of the same race can possibly have with one another.\r\nBut nobody falls in love with his sister. A profound instinct has taught\r\neven the lower races of men (for the most part) to avoid such union of\r\nthe all-but-identical. In the higher races the idea never so much as\r\noccurs to us. Even cousins seldom fall in love--seldom, that is to say,\r\nin comparison with the frequent opportunities of intercourse they enjoy,\r\nrelatively to the remainder of general society. When they do, and when\r\nthey carry out their perilous choice effectively by marriage, natural\r\nselection soon avenges Nature upon the offspring by cutting off the\r\nidiots, the consumptives, the weaklings, and the cripples, who often\r\nresult from such consanguineous marriages. In narrow communities, where\r\nbreeding in-and-in becomes almost inevitable, natural selection has\r\nsimilarly to exert itself upon a crowd of _crétins_ and other hapless\r\nincapables. But in wide and open champaign countries, where individual\r\nchoice has free room for exercise, men and women as a rule (if not\r\nconstrained by parents and moralists) marry for love, and marry on the\r\nwhole their natural complements. They prefer outsiders, fresh blood,\r\nsomebody who comes from beyond the community, to the people of their own\r\nimmediate surroundings. In many men the dislike to marrying among the\r\nfolk with whom they have been brought up amounts almost to a positive\r\ninstinct; they feel it as impossible to fall in love with a\r\nfellow-townswoman as to fall in love with their own first cousins. Among\r\nexogamous tribes such an instinct (aided, of course, by other extraneous\r\ncauses) has hardened into custom; and there is reason to believe (from\r\nthe universal traces among the higher civilisations of marriage by\r\ncapture) that all the leading races of the world are ultimately derived\r\nfrom exogamous ancestors, possessing this healthy and excellent\r\nsentiment.\r\n\r\nIn minor matters, it is of course universally admitted that short men,\r\nas a rule, prefer tall women, while tall men admire little women. Dark\r\npairs by preference with fair; the commonplace often runs after the\r\noriginal. People have long noticed that this attraction towards one's\r\nopposite tends to keep true the standard of the race; they have not,\r\nperhaps, so generally observed that it also indicates roughly the\r\nexistence in either individual of a desire for its own natural\r\ncomplement. It is difficult here to give definite examples, but\r\neverybody knows how, in the subtle psychology of Falling in Love, there\r\nare involved innumerable minor elements, physical and mental, which\r\nstrike us exactly because of their absolute adaptation to form with\r\nourselves an adequate union. Of course we do not definitely seek out\r\nand discover such qualities; instinct works far more intuitively than\r\nthat; but we find at last, by subsequent observation, how true and how\r\ntrustworthy were its immediate indications. That is to say, those men do\r\nso who were wise enough or fortunate enough to follow the earliest\r\npromptings of their own hearts, and not to be ashamed of that divinest\r\nand deepest of human intuitions, love at first sight.\r\n\r\nHow very subtle this intuition is, we can only guess in part by the\r\napparent capriciousness and incomprehensibility of its occasional\r\naction. We know that some men and women fall in love easily, while\r\nothers are only moved to love by some very special and singular\r\ncombination of peculiarities. We know that one man is readily stirred by\r\nevery pretty face he sees, while another man can only be roused by\r\nintellectual qualities or by moral beauty. We know that sometimes we\r\nmeet people possessing every virtue and grace under heaven, and yet for\r\nsome unknown and incomprehensible reason we could no more fall in love\r\nwith them than we could fall in love with the Ten Commandments. I don't,\r\nof course, for a moment accept the silly romantic notion that men and\r\nwomen fall in love only once in their lives, or that each one of us has\r\nsomewhere on earth his or her exact affinity, whom we must sooner or\r\nlater meet or else die unsatisfied. Almost every healthy normal man or\r\nwoman has probably fallen in love over and over again in the course of a\r\nlifetime (except in case of very early marriage), and could easily find\r\ndozens of persons with whom they would be capable of falling in love\r\nagain if due occasion offered. We are not all created in pairs, like the\r\nExchequer tallies, exactly intended to fit into one another's minor\r\nidiosyncrasies. Men and women as a rule very sensibly fall in love with\r\none another in the particular places and the particular societies they\r\nhappen to be cast among. A man at Ashby-de-la-Zouch does not hunt the\r\nworld over to find his pre-established harmony at Paray-le-Monial or at\r\nDenver, Colorado. But among the women he actually meets, a vast number\r\nare purely indifferent to him; only one or two, here and there, strike\r\nhim in the light of possible wives, and only one in the last resort\r\n(outside Salt Lake City) approves herself to his inmost nature as the\r\nactual wife of his final selection.\r\n\r\nNow this very indifference to the vast mass of our fellow-countrymen or\r\nfellow-countrywomen, this extreme pitch of selective preference in the\r\nhuman species, is just one mark of our extraordinary specialisation, one\r\nstamp and token of our high supremacy. The brutes do not so pick and\r\nchoose, though even there, as Darwin has shown, selection plays a large\r\npart (for the very butterflies are coy, and must be wooed and won). It\r\nis only in the human race itself that selection descends into such\r\nminute, such subtle, such indefinable discriminations. Why should a\r\nuniversal and common impulse have in our case these special limits? Why\r\nshould we be by nature so fastidious and so diversely affected? Surely\r\nfor some good and sufficient purpose. No deep-seated want of our complex\r\nlife would be so narrowly restricted without a law and a meaning.\r\nSometimes we can in part explain its conditions. Here, we see that\r\nbeauty plays a great _rôle_; there, we recognise the importance of\r\nstrength, of manner, of grace, of moral qualities. Vivacity, as Mr.\r\nGalton justly remarks, is one of the most powerful among human\r\nattractions, and often accounts for what might otherwise seem\r\nunaccountable preferences. But after all is said and done, there remains\r\na vast mass of instinctive and inexplicable elements: a power deeper and\r\nmore marvellous in its inscrutable ramifications than human\r\nconsciousness. 'What on earth,' we say, 'could So-and-so see in\r\nSo-and-so to fall in love with?' This very inexplicability I take to be\r\nthe sign and seal of a profound importance. An instinct so conditioned,\r\nso curious, so vague, so unfathomable, as we may guess by analogy with\r\nall other instincts, must be Nature's guiding voice within us, speaking\r\nfor the good of the human race in all future generations.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, let us suppose for a moment (impossible supposition!)\r\nthat mankind could conceivably divest itself of 'these foolish ideas\r\nabout love and the tastes of young people,' and could hand over the\r\nchoice of partners for life to a committee of anthropologists, presided\r\nover by Sir George Campbell. Would the committee manage things, I\r\nwonder, very much better than the Creator has managed them? Where would\r\nthey obtain that intimate knowledge of individual structures and\r\nfunctions and differences which would enable them to join together in\r\nholy matrimony fitting and complementary idiosyncrasies? Is a living\r\nman, with all his organs, and powers, and faculties, and dispositions,\r\nso simple and easy a problem to read that anybody else can readily\r\nundertake to pick out off-hand a help meet for him? I trow not! A man is\r\nnot a horse or a terrier. You cannot discern his 'points' by simple\r\ninspection. You cannot see _à priori_ why a Hanoverian bandsman and his\r\nheavy, ignorant, uncultured wife, should conspire to produce a Sir\r\nWilliam Herschel. If you tried to improve the breed artificially, either\r\nby choice from outside, or by the creation of an independent moral\r\nsentiment, irrespective of that instinctive preference which we call\r\nFalling in Love, I believe that so far from improving man, you would\r\nonly do one of two things--either spoil his constitution, or produce a\r\ntame stereotyped pattern of amiable imbecility. You would crush out all\r\ninitiative, all spontaneity, all diversity, all originality; you would\r\nget an animated moral code instead of living men and women.\r\n\r\nLook at the analogy of domestic animals. That is the analogy to which\r\nbreeding reformers always point with special pride: but what does it\r\nreally teach us? That you can't improve the efficiency of animals in any\r\none point to any high degree, without upsetting the general balance of\r\ntheir constitution. The race-horse can run a mile on a particular day at\r\na particular place, bar accidents, with wonderful speed: but that is\r\nabout all he is good for. His health as a whole is so surprisingly\r\nfeeble that he has to be treated with as much care as a delicate exotic.\r\n'In regard to animals and plants,' says Sir George Campbell, 'we have\r\nvery largely mastered the principles of heredity and culture, and the\r\nmodes by which good qualities may be maximised, bad qualities\r\nminimised.' True, so far as concerns a few points prized by ourselves\r\nfor our own purposes. But in doing this, we have so lowered the general\r\nconstitutional vigour of the plants or animals that our vines fall an\r\neasy prey to oidium and phylloxera, our potatoes to the potato disease\r\nand the Colorado beetle; our sheep are stupid, our rabbits idiotic, our\r\ndomestic breeds generally threatened with dangers to life and limb\r\nunknown to their wiry ancestors in the wild state. And when one comes to\r\ndeal with the infinitely more complex individuality of man, what hope\r\nwould there be of our improving the breed by deliberate selection? If we\r\ndeveloped the intellect, we would probably stunt the physique or the\r\nmoral nature; if we aimed at a general culture of all faculties alike,\r\nwe would probably end by a Chinese uniformity of mediocre dead level.\r\n\r\nThe balance of organs and faculties in a race is a very delicate organic\r\nequilibrium. How delicate we now know from thousands of examples, from\r\nthe correlations of seemingly unlike parts, from the wide-spread\r\neffects of small conditions, from the utter dying out of races like the\r\nTasmanians or the Paraguay Indians under circumstances different from\r\nthose with which their ancestors were familiar. What folly to interfere\r\nwith a marvellous instinct which now preserves this balance intact, in\r\nfavour of an untried artificial system which would probably wreck it as\r\nhelplessly as the modern system of higher education for women is\r\nwrecking the maternal powers of the best class in our English community!\r\n\r\nIndeed, within the race itself, as it now exists, free choice, aided by\r\nnatural selection, is actually improving every good point, and is for\r\never weeding out all the occasional failures and shortcomings of nature.\r\nFor weakly children, feeble children, stupid children, heavy children,\r\nare undoubtedly born under this very régime of falling in love, whose\r\naverage results I believe to be so highly beneficial. How is this? Well,\r\none has to take into consideration two points in seeking for the\r\nsolution of that obvious problem.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, no instinct is absolutely perfect. All of them\r\nnecessarily fail at some points. If on the average they do good, they\r\nare sufficiently justified. Now the material with which you have to\r\nstart in this case is not perfect. Each man marries, even in favourable\r\ncircumstances, not the abstractly best adapted woman in the world to\r\nsupplement or counteract his individual peculiarities, but the best\r\nwoman then and there obtainable for him. The result is frequently far\r\nfrom perfect; all I claim is that it would be as bad or a good deal\r\nworse if somebody else made the choice for him, or if he made the choice\r\nhimself on abstract biological and 'eugenic' principles. And, indeed,\r\nthe very existence of better and worse in the world is a condition\r\nprecedent of all upward evolution. Without an overstocked world, with\r\nindividual variations, some progressive, some retrograde, there could be\r\nno natural selection, no survival of the fittest. That is the chief\r\nbesetting danger of cut-and-dried doctrinaire views. Malthus was a very\r\ngreat man; but if his principle of prudential restraint were fully\r\ncarried out, the prudent would cease to reproduce their like, and the\r\nworld would be peopled in a few generations by the hereditarily reckless\r\nand dissolute and imprudent. Even so, if eugenic principles were\r\nuniversally adopted, the chance of exceptional and elevated natures\r\nwould be largely reduced, and natural selection would be in so much\r\ninterfered with or sensibly retarded.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, again, it must not be forgotten that falling in\r\nlove has never yet, among civilised men at least, had a fair field and\r\nno favour. Many marriages are arranged on very different\r\ngrounds--grounds of convenience, grounds of cupidity, grounds of\r\nreligion, grounds of snobbishness. In many cases it is clearly\r\ndemonstrable that such marriages are productive in the highest degree of\r\nevil consequences. Take the case of heiresses. An heiress is almost by\r\nnecessity the one last feeble and flickering relic of a moribund\r\nstock--often of a stock reduced by the sordid pursuit of ill-gotten\r\nwealth almost to the very verge of actual insanity. But let her be ever\r\nso ugly, ever so unhealthy, ever so hysterical, ever so mad, somebody or\r\nother will be ready and eager to marry her on any terms. Considerations\r\nof this sort have helped to stock the world with many feeble and\r\nunhealthy persons. Among the middle and upper classes it may be safely\r\nsaid only a very small percentage of marriages is ever due to love\r\nalone; in other words, to instinctive feeling. The remainder have been\r\ninfluenced by various side advantages, and nature has taken her\r\nvengeance accordingly on the unhappy offspring. Parents and moralists\r\nare ever ready to drown her voice, and to counsel marriage within one's\r\nown class, among nice people, with a really religious girl, and so forth\r\n_ad infinitum_. By many well-meaning young people these deadly\r\ninterferences with natural impulse are accepted as part of a higher and\r\nnobler law of conduct. The wretched belief that one should subordinate\r\nthe promptings of one's own soul to the dictates of a miscalculating and\r\nmisdirecting prudence has been instilled into the minds of girls\r\nespecially, until at last many of them have almost come to look upon\r\ntheir natural instincts as wrong, and the immoral, race-destructive\r\ncounsels of their seniors or advisers as the truest and purest earthly\r\nwisdom. Among certain small religious sects, again, such as the Quakers,\r\nthe duty of 'marrying in' has been strenuously inculcated, and only the\r\nstronger-minded and more individualistic members have had courage and\r\ninitiative enough to disregard precedent, and to follow the internal\r\ndivine monitor, as against the externally-imposed law of their\r\nparticular community. Even among wider bodies it is commonly held that\r\nCatholics must not marry Protestants; and the admirable results obtained\r\nby the mixture of Jewish with European blood have almost all been\r\nreached by male Jews having the temerity to marry 'Christian' women in\r\nthe face of opposition and persecution from their co-nationalists. It is\r\nvery rarely indeed that a Jewess will accept a European for a husband.\r\nIn so many ways, and on so many grounds, does convention interfere with\r\nthe plain and evident dictates of nature.\r\n\r\nAgainst all such evil parental promptings, however, a great safeguard is\r\nafforded to society by the wholesome and essentially philosophical\r\nteaching of romance and poetry. I do not approve of novels. They are for\r\nthe most part a futile and unprofitable form of literature; and it may\r\nprofoundly be regretted that the mere blind laws of supply and demand\r\nshould have diverted such an immense number of the ablest minds in\r\nEngland, France, and America, from more serious subjects to the\r\nproduction of such very frivolous and, on the whole, ephemeral works of\r\nart. But the novel has this one great counterpoise of undoubted good to\r\nset against all the manifold disadvantages and shortcomings of romantic\r\nliterature--that it always appeals to the true internal promptings of\r\ninherited instinct, and opposes the foolish and selfish suggestions of\r\ninterested outsiders. It is the perpetual protest of poor banished human\r\nnature against the expelling pitchfork of calculating expediency in the\r\nmatrimonial market. While parents and moralists are for ever saying,\r\n'Don't marry for beauty; don't marry for inclination; don't marry for\r\nlove: marry for money, marry for social position, marry for advancement,\r\nmarry for our convenience, not for your own,' the romance-writer is for\r\never urging, on the other hand, 'Marry for love, and for love only.' His\r\ngreat theme in all ages has been the opposition between parental or\r\nother external wishes and the true promptings of the young and\r\nunsophisticated human heart. He has been the chief ally of sentiment and\r\nof nature. He has filled the heads of all our girls with what Sir George\r\nCampbell describes off-hand as 'foolish ideas about love.' He has\r\npreserved us from the hateful conventions of civilisation. He has\r\nexalted the claims of personal attraction, of the mysterious native\r\nyearning of heart for heart, of the indefinite and indescribable element\r\nof mutual selection; and, in so doing, he has unconsciously proved\r\nhimself the best friend of human improvement and the deadliest enemy of\r\nall those hideous 'social lies which warp us from the living truth.' His\r\nmission is to deliver the world from Dr. Johnson and Sir George\r\nCampbell.\r\n\r\nFor, strange to say, it is the moralists and the doctrinaires who are\r\nalways in the wrong: it is the sentimentalists and the rebels who are\r\nalways in the right in this matter. If the common moral maxims of\r\nsociety could have had their way--if we had all chosen our wives and our\r\nhusbands, not for their beauty or their manliness, not for their eyes or\r\ntheir moustaches, not for their attractiveness or their vivacity, but\r\nfor their 'sterling qualities of mind and character,' we should now\r\ndoubtless be a miserable race of prigs and bookworms, of martinets and\r\npuritans, of nervous invalids and feeble idiots. It is because our young\r\nmen and maidens will not hearken to these penny-wise apophthegms of\r\nshallow sophistry--because they often prefer _Romeo and Juliet_ to the\r\n'Whole Duty of Man,' and a beautiful face to a round balance at\r\nCoutts's--that we still preserve some vitality and some individual\r\nfeatures, in spite of our grinding and crushing civilisation. The men\r\nwho marry balances, as Mr. Galton has shown, happily die out, leaving\r\nnone to represent them: the men who marry women they have been weak\r\nenough and silly enough to fall in love with, recruit the race with fine\r\nand vigorous and intelligent children, fortunately compounded of the\r\ncomplementary traits derived from two fairly contrasted and mutually\r\nreinforcing individualities.\r\n\r\nI have spoken throughout, for argument's sake, as though the only\r\ninterest to be considered in the married relation were the interests of\r\nthe offspring, and so ultimately of the race at large, rather than of\r\nthe persons themselves who enter into it. But I do not quite see why\r\neach generation should thus be sacrificed to the welfare of the\r\ngenerations that afterwards succeed it. Now it is one of the strongest\r\npoints in favour of the system of falling in love that it does, by\r\ncommon experience in the vast majority of instances, assort together\r\npersons who subsequently prove themselves thoroughly congenial and\r\nhelpful to one another. And this result I look upon as one great proof\r\nof the real value and importance of the instinct. Most men and women\r\nselect for themselves partners for life at an age when they know but\r\nlittle of the world, when they judge but superficially of characters and\r\nmotives, when they still make many mistakes in the conduct of life and\r\nin the estimation of chances. Yet most of them find in after days that\r\nthey have really chosen out of all the world one of the persons best\r\nadapted by native idiosyncrasy to make their joint lives enjoyable and\r\nuseful. I make every allowance for the effects of habit, for the growth\r\nof sentiment, for the gradual approximation of tastes and sympathies;\r\nbut surely, even so, it is a common consciousness with every one of us\r\nwho has been long married, that we could hardly conceivably have made\r\nourselves happy with any of the partners whom others have chosen; and\r\nthat we have actually made ourselves so with the partners we chose for\r\nourselves under the guidance of an almost unerring native instinct. Yet\r\nadaptation between husband and wife, so far as their own happiness is\r\nconcerned, can have had comparatively little to do with the evolution of\r\nthe instinct, as compared with adaptation for the joint production of\r\nvigorous and successful offspring. Natural selection lays almost all the\r\nstress on the last point, and hardly any at all upon the first one. If,\r\nthen, the instinct is found on the whole so trustworthy in the minor\r\nmatter, for which it has not specially been fashioned, how far more\r\ntrustworthy and valuable must it probably prove in the greater\r\nmatter--greater, I mean, as regards the interests of the race--for which\r\nit has been mainly or almost solely developed!\r\n\r\nI do not doubt that, as the world goes on, a deeper sense of moral\r\nresponsibility in the matter of marriage will grow up among us. But it\r\nwill not take the false direction of ignoring these our profoundest and\r\nholiest instincts. Marriage for money may go; marriage for rank may go;\r\nmarriage for position may go; but marriage for love, I believe and\r\ntrust, will last for ever. Men in the future will probably feel that a\r\nunion with their cousins or near relations is positively wicked; that a\r\nunion with those too like them in person or disposition is at least\r\nundesirable; that a union based upon considerations of wealth or any\r\nother consideration save considerations of immediate natural impulse, is\r\nbase and disgraceful. But to the end of time they will continue to feel,\r\nin spite of doctrinaires, that the voice of nature is better far than\r\nthe voice of the Lord Chancellor or the Royal Society; and that the\r\ninstinctive desire for a particular helpmate is a surer guide for the\r\nultimate happiness, both of the race and of the individual, than any\r\namount of deliberate consultation. It is not the foolish fancies of\r\nyouth that will have to be got rid of, but the foolish, wicked, and\r\nmischievous interference of parents or outsiders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRIGHT AND LEFT\r\n\r\n\r\nAdult man is the only animal who, in the familiar scriptural phrase,\r\n'knoweth the right hand from the left.' This fact in his economy goes\r\nclosely together with the other facts, that he is the only animal on\r\nthis sublunary planet who habitually uses a knife and fork, articulate\r\nlanguage, the art of cookery, the common pump, and the musical glasses.\r\nHis right-handedness, in short, is part cause and part effect of his\r\nuniversal supremacy in animated nature. He is what he is, to a great\r\nextent, 'by his own right hand;' and his own right hand, we may shrewdly\r\nsuspect, would never have differed at all from his left were it not for\r\nthe manifold arts and trades and activities he practises.\r\n\r\nIt was not always so, when wild in woods the noble savage ran. Man was\r\nonce, in his childhood on earth, what Charles Reade wanted him again to\r\nbe in his maturer centuries, ambidextrous. And lest any lady readers of\r\nthis volume--in the Cape of Good Hope, for example, or the remoter\r\nportions of the Australian bush, whither the culture of Girton and the\r\nfamiliar knowledge of the Latin language have not yet penetrated--should\r\ncomplain that I speak with unknown tongues, I will further explain for\r\ntheir special benefit that ambidextrous means equally-handed, using the\r\nright and the left indiscriminately. This, as Mr. Andrew Lang remarks\r\nin immortal verse, 'was the manner of Primitive Man.' He never minded\r\ntwopence which hand he used, as long as he got the fruit or the scalp he\r\nwanted. How could he when twopence wasn't yet invented? His mamma never\r\nsaid to him in early youth, 'Why-why,' or 'Tomtom,' as the case might\r\nbe, 'that's the wrong hand to hold your flint-scraper in.' He grew up to\r\nman's estate in happy ignorance of such minute and invidious\r\ndistinctions between his anterior extremities. Enough for him that his\r\nhands could grasp the forest boughs or chip the stone into shapely\r\narrows; and he never even thought in his innocent soul which particular\r\nhand he did it with.\r\n\r\nHow can I make this confident assertion, you ask, about a gentleman whom\r\nI never personally saw, and whose habits the intervention of five\r\nhundred centuries has precluded me from studying at close quarters? At\r\nfirst sight, you would suppose the evidence on such a point must be\r\npurely negative. The reconstructive historian must surely be inventing\r\n_à priori_ facts, evolved, _more Germanico_, from his inner\r\nconsciousness. Not so. See how clever modern archæology has become! I\r\nbase my assertion upon solid evidence. I know that Primitive Man was\r\nambidextrous, because he wrote and painted just as often with his left\r\nas with his right, and just as successfully.\r\n\r\nThis seems once more a hazardous statement to make about a remote\r\nancestor, in the age before the great glacial epoch had furrowed the\r\nmountains of Northern Europe; but, nevertheless, it is strictly true and\r\nstrictly demonstrable. Just try, as you read, to draw with the\r\nforefinger and thumb of your right hand an imaginary human profile on\r\nthe page on which these words are printed. Do you observe that (unless\r\nyou are an artist, and therefore sophisticated) you naturally and\r\ninstinctively draw it with the face turned towards your left shoulder?\r\nTry now to draw it with the profile to the right, and you will find it\r\nrequires a far greater effort of the thumb and fingers. The hand moves\r\nof its own accord from without inward, not from within outward. Then,\r\nagain, draw with your left thumb and forefinger another imaginary\r\nprofile, and you will find, for the same reason, that the face in this\r\ncase looks rightward. Existing savages, and our own young children,\r\nwhenever they draw a figure in profile, be it of man or beast, with\r\ntheir right hand, draw it almost always with the face or head turned to\r\nthe left, in accordance with this natural human instinct. Their doing so\r\nis a test of their perfect right-handedness.\r\n\r\nBut Primitive Man, or at any rate the most primitive men we know\r\npersonally, the carvers of the figures from the French bone-caves, drew\r\nmen and beasts, on bone or mammoth-tusk, turned either way\r\nindiscriminately. The inference is obvious. They must have been\r\nambidextrous. Only ambidextrous people draw so at the present day; and\r\nindeed to scrape a figure otherwise with a sharp flint on a piece of\r\nbone or tooth or mammoth-tusk would, even for a practised hand, be\r\ncomparatively difficult.\r\n\r\nI have begun my consideration of rights and lefts with this one very\r\nclear historical datum, because it is interesting to be able to say with\r\ntolerable certainty that there really was a period in our life as a\r\nspecies when man in the lump was ambidextrous. Why and how did he become\r\notherwise? This question is not only of importance in itself, as helping\r\nto explain the origin and source of man's supremacy in nature--his\r\ntool-using faculty--but it is also of interest from the light it casts\r\non that fallacy of poor Charles Reade's already alluded to--that we\r\nought all of us in this respect to hark back to the condition of\r\nsavages. I think when we have seen the reasons which make civilised man\r\nnow right-handed, we shall also see why it would be highly undesirable\r\nfor him to return, after so many ages of practice, to the condition of\r\nhis undeveloped stone-age ancestors.\r\n\r\nThe very beginning of our modern right-handedness goes back, indeed, to\r\nthe most primitive savagery. Why did one hand ever come to be different\r\nin use and function from another? The answer is, because man, in spite\r\nof all appearances to the contrary, is really one-sided. Externally,\r\nindeed, his congenital one-sidedness doesn't show: but it shows\r\ninternally. We all of us know, in spite of Sganarelle's assertion to the\r\ncontrary, that the apex of the heart inclines to the left side, and that\r\nthe liver and other internal organs show a generous disregard for strict\r\nand formal symmetry. In this irregular distribution of those human\r\norgans which polite society agrees to ignore, we get the clue to the\r\nirregularity of right and left in the human arm, and finally even the\r\nparticular direction of the printed letters now before you.\r\n\r\nFor primitive man did not belong to polite society. His manners were\r\nstrikingly deficient in that repose which stamps the caste of Vere de\r\nVere. When primitive man felt the tender passion steal over his soul, he\r\nlay in wait in the hush for the Phyllis or Daphne whose charms had\r\ninspired his heart with young desire; and when she passed his\r\nhiding-place, in maiden meditation, fancy free, he felled her with a\r\nclub, caught her tight by the hair of her head, and dragged her off in\r\ntriumph to his cave or his rock-shelter. (Marriage by capture, the\r\nlearned call this simple mode of primeval courtship.) When he found some\r\nStrephon or Damoetas rival him in the affections of the dusky sex, he\r\nand that rival fought the matter out like two bulls in a field; and the\r\nvictor and his Phyllis supped that evening off the roasted remains of\r\nthe vanquished suitor. I don't say these habits and manners were pretty;\r\nbut they were the custom of the time, and there's no good denying them.\r\n\r\nNow, Primitive Man, being thus by nature a fighting animal, fought for\r\nthe most part at first with his great canine teeth, his nails, and his\r\nfists; till in process of time he added to these early and natural\r\nweapons the further persuasions of a club or shillelagh. He also fought,\r\nas Darwin has very conclusively shown, in the main for the possession of\r\nthe ladies of his kind, against other members of his own sex and\r\nspecies. And if you fight, you soon learn to protect the most exposed\r\nand vulnerable portion of your body; or, if you don't, natural selection\r\nmanages it for you, by killing you off as an immediate consequence. To\r\nthe boxer, wrestler, or hand-to-hand combatant, that most vulnerable\r\nportion is undoubtedly the heart. A hard blow, well delivered on the\r\nleft breast, will easily kill, or at any rate stun, even a very strong\r\nman. Hence, from a very early period, men have used the right hand to\r\nfight with, and have employed the left arm chiefly to cover the heart\r\nand to parry a blow aimed at that specially vulnerable region. And when\r\nweapons of offence and defence supersede mere fists and teeth, it is the\r\nright hand that grasps the spear or sword, while the left holds over the\r\nheart for defence the shield or buckler.\r\n\r\nFrom this simple origin, then, the whole vast difference of right and\r\nleft in civilised life takes its beginning. At first, no doubt, the\r\nsuperiority of the right hand was only felt in the matter of fighting.\r\nBut that alone gave it a distinct pull, and paved the way, at last, for\r\nits supremacy elsewhere. For when weapons came into use, the habitual\r\nemployment of the right hand to grasp the spear, sword, or knife made\r\nthe nerves and muscles of the right side far more obedient to the\r\ncontrol of the will than those of the left. The dexterity thus acquired\r\nby the right--see how the very word 'dexterity' implies this fact--made\r\nit more natural for the early hunter and artificer to employ the same\r\nhand preferentially in the manufacture of flint hatchets, bows and\r\narrows, and in all the other manifold activities of savage life. It was\r\nthe hand with which he grasped his weapon; it was therefore the hand\r\nwith which he chipped it. To the very end, however, the right hand\r\nremains especially 'the hand in which you hold your knife;' and that is\r\nexactly how our own children to this day decide the question which is\r\nwhich, when they begin to know their right hand from their left for\r\npractical purposes.\r\n\r\nA difference like this, once set up, implies thereafter innumerable\r\nother differences which naturally flow from it. Some of them are\r\nextremely remote and derivative. Take, for example, the case of writing\r\nand printing. Why do these run from left to right? At first sight such a\r\npractice seems clearly contrary to the instinctive tendency I noticed\r\nabove--the tendency to draw from right to left, in accordance with the\r\nnatural sweep of the hand and arm. And, indeed, it is a fact that all\r\nearly writing habitually took the opposite direction from that which is\r\nnow universal in western countries. Every schoolboy knows, for instance\r\n(or at least he would if he came up to the proper Macaulay standard),\r\nthat Hebrew is written from right to left, and that each book begins at\r\nthe wrong cover. The reason is that words, and letters, and\r\nhieroglyphics were originally carved, scratched, or incised, instead of\r\nbeing written with coloured ink, and the hand was thus allowed to follow\r\nits natural bent, and to proceed, as we all do in naïve drawing, with a\r\nfree curve from the right leftward.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the very same fact--that we use the right hand alone in\r\nwriting--made the letters run the opposite way in the end; and the\r\nchange was due to the use of ink and other pigments for staining\r\npapyrus, parchment, or paper. If the hand in this case moved from right\r\nto left it would of course smear what it had already written; and to\r\nprevent such untidy smudging of the words, the order of writing was\r\nreversed from left rightward. The use of wax tablets also, no doubt,\r\nhelped forward the revolution, for in this case, too, the hand would\r\ncover and rub out the words written.\r\n\r\nThe strict dependence of writing, indeed, upon the material employed is\r\nnowhere better shown than in the case of the Assyrian cuneiform\r\ninscriptions. The ordinary substitute for cream-laid note in the\r\nEuphrates valley in its palmy days was a clay or terra-cotta tablet, on\r\nwhich the words to be recorded--usually a deed of sale or something of\r\nthe sort--were impressed while it was wet and then baked in, solid. And\r\nthe method of impressing them was very simple; the workman merely\r\npressed the end of his graver or wedge into the moist clay, thus giving\r\nrise to triangular marks which were arranged in the shapes of various\r\nletters. When alabaster, or any other hard material, was substituted for\r\nclay, the sculptor imitated these natural dabs or triangular imprints;\r\nand that was the origin of those mysterious and very learned-looking\r\ncuneiforms. This, I admit, is a palpable digression; but inasmuch as it\r\nthrows an indirect light on the simple reasons which sometimes bring\r\nabout great results, I hold it not wholly alien to the present serious\r\nphilosophical inquiry.\r\n\r\nPrinting, in turn, necessarily follows the rule of writing, so that in\r\nfact the order of letters and words on this page depends ultimately upon\r\nthe remote fact that primitive man had to use his right hand to deliver\r\na blow, and his left to parry, or to guard his heart.\r\n\r\nSome curious and hardly noticeable results flow once more from this\r\norder of writing from left to right. You will find, if you watch\r\nyourself closely, that in examining a landscape, or the view from a\r\nhill-top, your eye naturally ranges from left to right; and that you\r\nbegin your survey, as you would begin reading a page of print, from the\r\nleft-hand corner. Apparently, the now almost instinctive act of reading\r\n(for Dogberry was right after all, for the civilised infant) has\r\naccustomed our eyes to this particular movement, and has made it\r\nespecially natural when we are trying to 'read' or take in at a glance\r\nthe meaning of any complex and varied total.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of pictures, I notice, the correlation has even gone a\r\nstep farther. Not only do we usually take in the episodes of a painting\r\nfrom left to right, but the painter definitely and deliberately intends\r\nus so to take them in. For wherever two or three distinct episodes in\r\nsuccession are represented on a single plane in the same picture--as\r\nhappens often in early art--they are invariably represented in the\r\nprecise order of the words on a written or printed page, beginning at\r\nthe upper left-hand corner, and ending at the lower right-hand angle. I\r\nfirst noticed this curious extension of the common principle in the\r\nmediæval frescoes of the Campo Santo at Pisa; and I have since verified\r\nit by observations on many other pictures elsewhere, both ancient and\r\nmodern. The Campo Santo, however, forms an exceptionally good museum of\r\nsuch story-telling frescoes by various painters, as almost every picture\r\nconsists of several successive episodes. The famous Benozzo Gozzoli, for\r\nexample, of Noah's Vineyard represents on a single plane all the stages\r\nin that earliest drama of intoxication, from the first act of gathering\r\nthe grapes on the top left, to the scandalised lady, the _vergognosa di\r\nPisa_, who covers her face with her hands in shocked horror at the\r\npatriarch's disgrace in the lower right-hand corner.\r\n\r\nObserve, too, that the very conditions of _technique_ demand this order\r\nalmost as rigorously in painting as in writing. For the painter will\r\nnaturally so work as not to smudge over what he has already painted: and\r\nhe will also naturally begin with the earliest episode in the story he\r\nunfolds, proceeding to the others in due succession. From which two\r\nprinciples it necessarily results that he will begin at the upper left,\r\nand end at the lower right-hand corner.\r\n\r\nI have skipped lightly, I admit, over a considerable interval between\r\nprimitive man and Benozzo Gozzoli. But consider further that during all\r\nthat time the uses of the right and left hand were becoming by gradual\r\ndegrees each day still further differentiated and specialised.\r\nInnumerable trades, occupations, and habits imply ever-widening\r\ndifferences in the way we use them. It is not the right hand alone that\r\nhas undergone an education in this respect: the left, too, though\r\nsubordinate, has still its own special functions to perform. If the\r\nsavage chips his flints with a blow of the right, he holds the core, or\r\nmain mass of stone from which he strikes it, firmly with his left. If\r\none hand is specially devoted to the knife, the other grasps the fork to\r\nmake up for it. In almost every act we do with both hands, each has a\r\nseparate office to which it is best fitted. Take, for example, so simple\r\na matter as buttoning one's coat, where a curious distinction between\r\nthe habits of the sexes enables us to test the principle with ease and\r\ncertainty. Men's clothes are always made with the buttons on the right\r\nside and the button-holes on the left. Women's, on the contrary, are\r\nalways made with the buttons on the left side, and the button-holes on\r\nthe right. (The occult reason for this curious distinction, which has\r\nlong engaged the attention of philosophers, has never yet been\r\ndiscovered, but it is probably to be accounted for by the perversity of\r\nwomen.) Well, if a man tries to put on a woman's waterproof, or a woman\r\nto put on a man's ulster, each will find that neither hand is readily\r\nable to perform the part of the other. A man, in buttoning, grasps the\r\nbutton in his right hand, pushes it through with his right thumb, holds\r\nthe button-hole open with his left, and pulls all straight with his\r\nright forefinger. Reverse the sides, and both hands at once seem\r\nequally helpless.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to note how many little peculiarities of dress or\r\nmanufacture are equally necessitated by this prime distinction of right\r\nand left. Here are a very few of them, which the reader can indefinitely\r\nincrease for himself. (I leave out of consideration obvious cases like\r\nboots and gloves: to insult that proverbially intelligent person's\r\nintelligence with those were surely unpardonable.) A scarf habitually\r\ntied in a sailor's knot acquires one long side, left, and one short one,\r\nright, from the way it is manipulated by the right hand; if it were tied\r\nby the left, the relations would be reversed. The spiral of corkscrews\r\nand of ordinary screws turned by hand goes in accordance with the\r\nnatural twist of the right hand: try to drive in an imaginary corkscrew\r\nwith the right hand, the opposite way, and you will see how utterly\r\nawkward and clumsy is the motion. The strap of the flap that covers the\r\nkeyhole in trunks and portmanteaus always has its fixed side over to the\r\nright, and its buckle to the left; in this way only can it be\r\nconveniently buckled by a right-handed person. The hands of watches and\r\nthe numbers of dial-faced barometers run from left to right: this is a\r\npeculiarity dependent upon the left to right system of writing. A\r\nservant offers you dishes from the left side: you can't so readily help\r\nyourself from the right, unless left-handed. Schopenhauer despaired of\r\nthe German race, because it could never be taught like the English to\r\nkeep to the right side of the pavement in walking. A sword is worn at\r\nthe left hip: a handkerchief is carried in the right pocket, if at the\r\nside; in the left, if in the coat-tails: in either case for the right\r\nhand to get at it most easily. A watch-pocket is made in the left\r\nbreast; a pocket for railway tickets half-way down the right side. Try to\r\nreverse any one of these simple actions, and you will see at once that\r\nthey are immediately implied in the very fact of our original\r\nright-handedness.\r\n\r\nAnd herein, I think, we find the true answer to Charles Reade's mistaken\r\nnotion of the advantages of ambidexterity. You couldn't make both hands\r\ndo everything alike without a considerable loss of time, effort,\r\nefficiency, and convenience. Each hand learns to do its own work and to\r\ndo it well; if you made it do the other hand's into the bargain, it\r\nwould have a great deal more to learn, and we should find it difficult\r\neven then to prevent specialisation. We should have to make things\r\ndeliberately different for the two hands--to have rights and lefts in\r\neverything, as we have them now in boots and gloves--or else one hand\r\nmust inevitably gain the supremacy. Sword-handles, shears, surgical\r\ninstruments, and hundreds of other things have to be made right-handed,\r\nwhile palettes and a few like subsidiary objects are adapted to the\r\nleft; in each case for a perfectly sufficient reason. You can't upset\r\nall this without causing confusion. More than that, the division of\r\nlabour thus brought about is certainly a gain to those who possess it:\r\nfor if it were not so, the ambidextrous races would have beaten the\r\ndextro-sinistrals in the struggle for existence; whereas we know that\r\nthe exact opposite has been the case. Man's special use of the right\r\nhand is one of his points of superiority to the brutes. If ever his\r\nright hand should forget its cunning, his supremacy would indeed begin\r\nto totter. Depend upon it, Nature is wiser than even Charles Reade. What\r\nshe finds most useful in the long run must certainly have many good\r\npoints to recommend it.\r\n\r\nAnd this last consideration suggests another aspect of right and left\r\nwhich must not be passed over without one word in this brief survey of\r\nthe philosophy of the subject. The superiority of the right caused it\r\nearly to be regarded as the fortunate, lucky, and trusty hand; the\r\ninferiority of the left caused it equally to be considered as\r\nill-omened, unlucky, and, in one expressive word, sinister. Hence come\r\ninnumerable phrases and superstitions. It is the right hand of\r\nfriendship that we always grasp; it is with our own right hand that we\r\nvindicate our honour against sinister suspicions. On the other hand, it\r\nis 'over the left' that we believe a doubtful or incredible statement; a\r\nleft-handed compliment or a left-handed marriage carry their own\r\ncondemnation with them. On the right hand of the host is the seat of\r\nhonour; it is to the left that the goats of ecclesiastical controversy\r\nare invariably relegated. The very notions of the right hand and ethical\r\nright have got mixed up inextricably in every language: _droit_ and _la\r\ndroite_ display it in French as much as right and the right in English.\r\nBut to be _gauche_ is merely to be awkward and clumsy; while to be right\r\nis something far higher and more important.\r\n\r\nSo unlucky, indeed, does the left hand at last become that merely to\r\nmention it is an evil omen; and so the Greeks refused to use the true\r\nold Greek word for left at all, and preferred euphemistically to\r\ndescribe it as _euonymos_, the well-named or happy-omened. Our own\r\n_left_ seems equally to mean the hand that is left after the right has\r\nbeen mentioned, or, in short, the other one. Many things which are lucky\r\nif seen on the right are fateful omens if seen to leftward. On the other\r\nhand, if you spill the salt, you propitiate destiny by tossing a pinch\r\nof it over the left shoulder. A murderer's left hand is said by good\r\nauthorities to be an excellent thing to do magic with; but here I cannot\r\nspeak from personal experience. Nor do I know why the wedding-ring is\r\nworn on the left hand; though it is significant, at any rate, that the\r\nmark of slavery should be put by the man with his own right upon the\r\ninferior member of the weaker vessel. Strong-minded ladies may get up an\r\nagitation if they like to alter this gross injustice of the centuries.\r\n\r\nOne curious minor application of rights and lefts is the rule of the\r\nroad as it exists in England. How it arose I can't say, any more than I\r\ncan say why a lady sits her side-saddle to the left. Coachmen, to be\r\nsure, are quite unanimous that the leftward route enables them to see\r\nhow close they are passing to another carriage; but, as all continental\r\nauthority is equally convinced the other way, I make no doubt this is a\r\nmere illusion of long-continued custom. It is curious, however, that the\r\nEnglish usage, having once obtained in these islands, has influenced\r\nrailways, not only in Britain, but over all Europe. Trains, like\r\ncarriages, go to the left when they pass; and this habit, quite natural\r\nin England, was transplanted by the early engineers to the Continent,\r\nwhere ordinary carriages, of course, go to the right. In America, to be\r\nsure, the trains also go right like the carriages; but then, those\r\nAmericans have such a curiously un-English way of being strictly\r\nconsistent and logical in their doings. In Britain we should have\r\ncompromised the matter by going sometimes one way and sometimes the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEVOLUTION\r\n\r\n\r\nEverybody nowadays talks about evolution. Like electricity, the cholera\r\ngerm, woman's rights, the great mining boom, and the Eastern Question,\r\nit is 'in the air.' It pervades society everywhere with its subtle\r\nessence; it infects small-talk with its familiar catchwords and its\r\nslang phrases; it even permeates that last stronghold of rampant\r\nPhilistinism, the third leader in the penny papers. Everybody believes\r\nhe knows all about it, and discusses it as glibly in his everyday\r\nconversation as he discusses the points of racehorses he has never seen,\r\nthe charms of peeresses he has never spoken to, and the demerits of\r\nauthors he has never read. Everybody is aware, in a dim and nebulous\r\nsemi-conscious fashion, that it was all invented by the late Mr. Darwin,\r\nand reduced to a system by Mr. Herbert Spencer--don't you know?--and a\r\nlot more of those scientific fellows. It is generally understood in the\r\nbest-informed circles that evolutionism consists for the most part in a\r\nbelief about nature at large essentially similar to that applied by\r\nTopsy to her own origin and early history. It is conceived, in short,\r\nthat most things 'growed.' Especially is it known that in the opinion of\r\nthe evolutionists as a body we are all of us ultimately descended from\r\nmen with tails, who were the final offspring and improved edition of the\r\ncommon gorilla. That, very briefly put, is the popular conception of the\r\nvarious points in the great modern evolutionary programme.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to inform the intelligent reader, who of course\r\ndiffers fundamentally from that inferior class of human beings known to\r\nall of us in our own minds as 'other people,' that almost every point in\r\nthe catalogue thus briefly enumerated is a popular fallacy of the\r\nwildest description. Mr. Darwin did not invent evolution any more than\r\nGeorge Stephenson invented the steam-engine, or Mr. Edison the electric\r\ntelegraph. We are not descended from men with tails, any more than we\r\nare descended from Indian elephants. There is no evidence that we have\r\nanything in particular more than the remotest fiftieth cousinship with\r\nour poor relation the West African gorilla. Science is not in search of\r\na 'missing link'; few links are anywhere missing, and those are for the\r\nmost part wholly unimportant ones. If we found the imaginary link in\r\nquestion, he would not be a monkey, nor yet in any way a tailed man. And\r\nso forth generally through the whole list of popular beliefs and current\r\nfallacies as to the real meaning of evolutionary teaching. Whatever most\r\npeople think evolutionary is for the most part a pure parody of the\r\nevolutionist's opinion.\r\n\r\nBut a more serious error than all these pervades what we may call the\r\ndrawing-room view of the evolutionist theory. So far as Society with a\r\nbig initial is concerned, evolutionism first began to be talked about,\r\nand therefore known (for Society does not read; it listens, or rather it\r\noverhears and catches fragmentary echoes) when Darwin published his\r\n'Origin of Species.' That great book consisted simply of a theory as to\r\nthe causes which led to the distinctions of kind between plants and\r\nanimals. With evolution at large it had nothing to do; it took for\r\ngranted the origin of sun, moon, and stars, planets and comets, the\r\nearth and all that in it is, the sea and the dry land, the mountains and\r\nthe valleys, nay even life itself in the crude form, everything in fact,\r\nsave the one point of the various types and species of living beings.\r\nLong before Darwin's book appeared evolution had been a recognised force\r\nin the moving world of science and philosophy. Kant and Laplace had\r\nworked out the development of suns and earths from white-hot\r\nstar-clouds. Lyell had worked out the evolution of the earth's surface\r\nto its present highly complex geographical condition. Lamarck had worked\r\nout the descent of plants and animals from a common ancestor by slow\r\nmodification. Herbert Spencer had worked out the growth of mind from its\r\nsimplest beginnings to its highest outcome in human thought.\r\n\r\nBut Society, like Gallio, cared nothing for all these things. The\r\nevolutionary principles had never been put into a single big book, asked\r\nfor at Mudie's, and permitted to lie on the drawing-room table side by\r\nside with the last new novel and the last fat volume of scandalous court\r\nmemoirs. Therefore Society ignored them and knew them not; the word\r\nevolution scarcely entered at all as yet into its polite and refined\r\ndinner-table vocabulary. It recognised only the 'Darwinian theory,'\r\n'natural selection,' 'the missing link,' and the belief that men were\r\nmerely monkeys who had lost their tails, presumably by sitting upon\r\nthem. To the world at large that learned Mr. Darwin had invented and\r\npatented the entire business, including descent with modification, if\r\nsuch notions ever occurred at all to the world-at-large's speculative\r\nintelligence.\r\n\r\nNow, evolutionism is really a thing of far deeper growth and older\r\nantecedents than this easy, superficial drawing-room view would lead us\r\nto imagine. It is a very ancient and respectable theory indeed, and it\r\nhas an immense variety of minor developments. I am not going to push it\r\nback, in the fashionable modern scientific manner, to the vague and\r\nindefinite hints in our old friend Lucretius. The great original Roman\r\npoet--the only original poet in the Latin language--did indeed hit out\r\nfor himself a very good rough working sketch of a sort of nebulous and\r\nshapeless evolutionism. It was bold, it was consistent, for its time it\r\nwas wonderful. But Lucretius's philosophy, like all the philosophies of\r\nthe older world, was a mere speculative idea, a fancy picture of the\r\ndevelopment of things, not dependent upon observation of facts at all,\r\nbut wholly evolved, like the German thinker's camel, out of its author's\r\nown pregnant inner consciousness. The Roman poet would no doubt have\r\nbuilt an excellent superstructure if he had only possessed a little\r\nstraw to make his bricks of. As it was, however, scientific brick-making\r\nbeing still in its infancy, he could only construct in a day a shadowy\r\nAladdin's palace of pure fanciful Epicurean phantasms, an imaginary\r\nworld of imaginary atoms, fortuitously concurring out of void chaos into\r\nan orderly universe, as though by miracle. It is not thus that systems\r\narise which regenerate the thought of humanity; he who would build for\r\nall time must make sure first of a solid foundation, and then use sound\r\nbricks in place of the airy nothings of metaphysical speculation.\r\n\r\nIt was in the last century that the evolutionary idea really began to\r\ntake form and shape in the separate conceptions of Kant, Laplace,\r\nLamarck, and Erasmus Darwin. These were the true founders of our modern\r\nevolutionism. Charles Darwin and Herbert Spencer were the Joshuas who\r\nled the chosen people into the land which more than one venturous Moses\r\nhad already dimly descried afar off from the Pisgah top of the\r\neighteenth century.\r\n\r\nKant and Laplace came first in time, as astronomy comes first in logical\r\norder. Stars and suns, and planets and satellites, necessarily precede\r\nin development plants and animals. You can have no cabbages without a\r\nworld to grow them in. The science of the stars was therefore reduced to\r\ncomparative system and order, while the sciences of life, and mind, and\r\nmatter were still a hopeless and inextricable muddle. It was no wonder,\r\nthen, that the evolution of the heavenly bodies should have been clearly\r\napprehended and definitely formulated while the evolution of the earth's\r\ncrust was still imperfectly understood, and the evolution of living\r\nbeings was only tentatively and hypothetically hinted at in a timid\r\nwhisper.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning, say the astronomical evolutionists, not only this\r\nworld, but all the other worlds in the universe, existed potentially, as\r\nthe poet justly remarks, in 'a haze of fluid light,' a vast nebula of\r\nenormous extent and almost inconceivable material thinness. The world\r\narose out of a sort of primitive world-gruel. The matter of which it was\r\ncomposed was gas, of such an extraordinary and unimaginable gasiness\r\nthat millions of cubic miles of it might easily be compressed into a\r\ncommon antibilious pill-box. The pill-box itself, in fact, is the net\r\nresult of a prolonged secular condensation of myriads of such enormous\r\ncubes of this primæval matter. Slowly setting around common centres,\r\nhowever, in anticipation of Sir Isaac Newton's gravitative theories, the\r\nfluid haze gradually collected into suns and stars, whose light and heat\r\nis presumably due to the clashing together of their component atoms as\r\nthey fall perpetually towards the central mass. Just as in a burning\r\ncandle the impact of the oxygen atoms in the air against the carbon and\r\nhydrogen atoms in the melted and rarefied wax or tallow produces the\r\nlight and heat of the flame, so in nebula or sun the impact of the\r\nvarious gravitating atoms one against the other produces the light and\r\nheat by whose aid we are enabled to see and know those distant bodies.\r\nThe universe, according to this now fashionable nebular theory, began as\r\na single vast ocean of matter of immense tenuity, spread all alike over\r\nall space as far as nowhere, and comparatively little different within\r\nitself when looked at side by side with its own final historical\r\noutcome. In Mr. Spencer's perspicuous phrase, evolution in this aspect\r\nis a change from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous, from the\r\nincoherent to the coherent, and from the indefinite to the definite\r\ncondition. Difficult words at first to apprehend, no doubt, and\r\ntherefore to many people, as to Mr. Matthew Arnold, very repellent, but\r\nfull of meaning, lucidity, and suggestiveness, if only we once take the\r\ntrouble fairly and squarely to understand them.\r\n\r\nEvery sun and every star thus formed is for ever gathering in the hem of\r\nits outer robe upon itself, for ever radiating off its light and heat\r\ninto surrounding space, and for ever growing denser and colder as it\r\nsets slowly towards its centre of gravity. Our own sun and solar system\r\nmay be taken as good typical working examples of how the stars thus\r\nconstantly shrink into smaller and ever smaller dimensions around their\r\nown fixed centre. Naturally, we know more about our own solar system\r\nthan about any other in our own universe, and it also possesses for us a\r\ngreater practical and personal interest than any outside portion of the\r\ngalaxy. Nobody can pretend to be profoundly immersed in the internal\r\naffairs of Sirius or of Alpha Centauri. A fiery revolution in the belt\r\nof Orion would affect us less than a passing finger-ache in a certain\r\nsingle terrestrial baby of our own household. Therefore I shall not\r\napologise in any way for leaving the remainder of the sidereal universe\r\nto its unknown fate, and concentrating my attention mainly on the\r\naffairs of that solitary little, out-of-the-way, second-rate system,\r\nwhereof we form an inappreciable portion. The matter which now composes\r\nthe sun and its attendant bodies (the satellites included) was once\r\nspread out, according to Laplace, to at least the furthest orbit of the\r\noutermost planet--that is to say, so far as our present knowledge goes,\r\nthe planet Neptune. Of course, when it was expanded to that immense\r\ndistance, it must have been very thin indeed, thinner than our clumsy\r\nhuman senses can even conceive of. An American would say, too thin; but\r\nI put Americans out of court at once as mere irreverent scoffers. From\r\nthe orbit of Neptune, or something outside it, the faint and cloud-like\r\nmass which bore within it Cæsar and his fortunes, not to mention the\r\nremainder of the earth and the solar system, began slowly to converge\r\nand gather itself in, growing denser and denser but smaller and smaller\r\nas it gradually neared its existing dimensions. How long a time it took\r\nto do it is for our present purpose relatively unimportant: the cruel\r\nphysicists will only let us have a beggarly hundred million years or so\r\nfor the process, while the grasping and extravagant evolutionary\r\ngeologists beg with tears for at least double or even ten times that\r\nlimited period. But at any rate it has taken a good long while, and, as\r\nfar as most of us are personally concerned, the difference of one or two\r\nhundred millions, if it comes to that, is not really at all an\r\nappreciable one.\r\n\r\nAs it condensed and lessened towards its central core, revolving rapidly\r\non its great axis, the solar mist left behind at irregular intervals\r\nconcentric rings or belts of cloud-like matter, cast off from its\r\nequator; which belts, once more undergoing a similar evolution on their\r\nown account, have hardened round their private centres of gravity into\r\nJupiter or Saturn, the Earth or Venus. Round these again, minor belts or\r\nrings have sometimes formed, as in Saturn's girdle of petty satellites;\r\nor subsidiary planets, thrown out into space, have circled round their\r\nown primaries, as the moon does around this sublunary world of ours.\r\nMeanwhile, the main central mass of all, retreating ever inward as it\r\ndropped behind it these occasional little reminders of its temporary\r\nstoppages, formed at last the sun itself, the main luminary of our\r\nentire system. Now, I won't deny that this primitive Kantian and\r\nLaplacian evolutionism, this nebular theory of such exquisite\r\nconcinnity, here reduced to its simplest terms and most elementary\r\ndimensions, has received many hard knocks from later astronomers, and\r\nhas been a good deal bowled over, both on mathematical and astronomical\r\ngrounds, by recent investigators of nebulæ and meteors. Observations on\r\ncomets and on the sun's surface have lately shown that it contains in\r\nall likelihood a very considerable fanciful admixture. It isn't more\r\nthan half true; and even the half now totters in places. Still, as a\r\nvehicle of popular exposition the crude nebular hypothesis in its rawest\r\nform serves a great deal better than the truth, so far as yet known, on\r\nthe good old Greek principle of the half being often more than the\r\nwhole. The great point which it impresses on the mind is the cardinal\r\nidea of the sun and planets, with their attendant satellites, not as\r\nturned out like manufactured articles, ready made, at measured\r\nintervals, in a vast and deliberate celestial Orrery, but as due to the\r\nslow and gradual working of natural laws, in accordance with which each\r\nhas assumed by force of circumstances its existing place, weight, orbit,\r\nand motion.\r\n\r\nThe grand conception of a gradual becoming, instead of a sudden making,\r\nwhich Kant and Laplace thus applied to the component bodies of the\r\nuniverse at large, was further applied by Lyell and his school to the\r\nouter crust of this one particular petty planet of ours. While the\r\nastronomers went in for the evolution of suns, stars, and worlds, Lyell\r\nand his geological brethren went in for the evolution of the earth's\r\nsurface. As theirs was stellar, so his was mundane. If the world began\r\nby being a red-hot mass of planetary matter in a high state of internal\r\nexcitement, boiling and dancing with the heat of its emotions, it\r\ngradually cooled down with age and experience, for growing old is\r\ngrowing cold, as every one of us in time, alas, discovers. As it passed\r\nfrom its fiery and volcanic youth to its staider and soberer middle age,\r\na solid crust began to form in filmy fashion upon its cooling surface.\r\nThe aqueous vapour that had floated at first as steam around its heated\r\nmass condensed with time into a wide ocean over the now hardened shell.\r\nGradually this ocean shifted its bulk into two or three main bodies that\r\nsank into hollows of the viscid crust, the precursors of Atlantic,\r\nPacific, and the Indian Seas. Wrinklings of the crust, produced by the\r\ncooling and consequent contraction, gave rise at first to baby mountain\r\nranges, and afterwards to the earliest rough draughts of the still very\r\nvague and sketchy continents. The world grew daily more complex and more\r\ndiverse; it progressed, in accordance with the Spencerian law, from the\r\nhomogeneous to the heterogeneous, and so forth, as aforesaid, with\r\ndelightful regularity.\r\n\r\nAt last, by long and graduated changes, seas and lands, peninsulas and\r\nislands, lakes and rivers, hills and mountains, were wrought out by\r\ninternal or external energies on the crust thus generally fashioned.\r\nEvaporation from the oceans gave rise to clouds and rain and hailstorms;\r\nthe water that fell upon the mountain tops cut out the valleys and river\r\nbasins; rills gathered into brooks, brooks into streams, streams into\r\nprimæval Niles, and Amazons, and Mississippis. Volcanic forces uplifted\r\nhere an Alpine chain, or depressed there a deep-sea hollow. Sediment\r\nwashed from the hills and plains, or formed from countless skeletons of\r\nmarine creatures, gathered on the sinking bed of the ocean as soft ooze,\r\nor crumbling sand, or thick mud, or gravel and conglomerate. Now\r\nupheaved into an elevated table-land, now slowly carved again by rain\r\nand rill into valley and watershed, and now worn down once more into\r\nthe mere degraded stump of a plateau, the crust underwent innumerable\r\nchanges, but almost all of them exactly the same in kind, and mostly in\r\ndegree, as those we still see at work imperceptibly in the world around\r\nus. Rain washing down the soil; weather crumbling the solid rock; waves\r\ndashing at the foot of the cliffs; rivers forming deltas at their barred\r\nmouths; shingle gathering on the low spits; floods sweeping before them\r\nthe countryside; ice grinding ceaselessly at the mountain top; peat\r\nfilling up the shallow lake--these are the chief factors which have gone\r\nto make the physical world as we now actually know it. Land and sea,\r\ncoast and contour, hill and valley, dale and gorge, earth-sculpture\r\ngenerally--all are due to the ceaseless interaction of these separately\r\nsmall and unnoticeable causes, aided or retarded by the slow effects of\r\nelevation or depression from the earth's shrinkage towards its own\r\ncentre. Geology, in short, has shown us that the world is what it is,\r\nnot by virtue of a single sudden creative act, nor by virtue of\r\nsuccessive terrible and recurrent cataclysms, but by virtue of the slow\r\ncontinuous action of causes still always equally operative.\r\n\r\nEvolution in geology leads up naturally to evolution in the science of\r\nlife. If the world itself grew, why not also the animals and plants that\r\ninhabit it? Already in the eager active eighteenth century this obvious\r\nidea had struck in the germ a large number of zoologists and botanists,\r\nand in the hands of Lamarck and Erasmus Darwin it took form as a\r\ndistinct and elaborate system of organic evolution. Buffon had been the\r\nfirst to hint at the truth; but Buffon was an eminently respectable\r\nnobleman in the dubious days of the tottering monarchy, and he did not\r\ncare personally for the Bastille, viewed as a place of permanent\r\nresidence. In Louis Quinze's France, indeed, as things then went, a man\r\nwho offended the orthodoxy of the Sorbonne was prone to find himself\r\nshortly ensconced in free quarters, and kept there for the term of his\r\nnatural existence without expense to his heirs or executors. So Buffon\r\ndid not venture to say outright that he thought all animals and plants\r\nwere descended one from the other with slight modifications; that would\r\nhave been wicked, and the Sorbonne would have proved its wickedness to\r\nhim in a most conclusive fashion by promptly getting him imprisoned or\r\nsilenced. It is so easy to confute your opponent when you are a hundred\r\nstrong and he is one weak unit. Buffon merely said, therefore, that if\r\nwe didn't know the contrary to be the case by sure warrant, we might\r\neasily have concluded (so fallible is our reason) that animals always\r\nvaried slightly, and that such variations, indefinitely accumulated,\r\nwould suffice to account for almost any amount of ultimate difference. A\r\ndonkey might thus have grown into a horse, and a bird might have\r\ndeveloped from a primitive lizard. Only we know it was quite otherwise!\r\nA quiet hint from Buffon was as good as a declaration from many less\r\nknowing or suggestive people. All over Europe, the wise took Buffon's\r\nhint for what he meant it; and the unwise blandly passed it by as a mere\r\npassing little foolish vagary of that great ironical writer and thinker.\r\n\r\nErasmus Darwin, the grandfather of his grandson, was no fool; on the\r\ncontrary, he was the most far-sighted man of his day in England; he saw\r\nat once what Buffon was driving at; and he worked out 'Mr. Buffon's'\r\nhalf-concealed hint to all its natural and legitimate conclusions. The\r\ngreat Count was always plain Mr. Buffon to his English contemporary.\r\nLife, said Erasmus Darwin nearly a century since, began in very minute\r\nmarine forms, which gradually acquired fresh powers and larger bodies,\r\nso as imperceptibly to transform themselves into different creatures.\r\nMan, he remarked, anticipating his descendant, takes rabbits or\r\npigeons, and alters them almost to his own fancy, by immensely changing\r\ntheir shapes and colours. If man can make a pouter or a fantail out of\r\nthe common runt, if he can produce a piebald lop-ear from the brown wild\r\nrabbit, if he can transform Dorkings into Black Spanish, why cannot\r\nNature, with longer time to work in, and endless lives to try with,\r\nproduce all the varieties of vertebrate animals out of one single common\r\nancestor? It was a bold idea of the Lichfield doctor--bold, at least,\r\nfor the times he lived in--when Sam Johnson was held a mighty sage, and\r\nphysical speculation was regarded askance as having in it a dangerous\r\ntouch of the devil. But the Darwins were always a bold folk, and had the\r\ncourage of their opinions more than most men. So even in Lichfield,\r\ncathedral city as it was, and in the politely somnolent eighteenth\r\ncentury, Erasmus Darwin ventured to point out the probability that\r\nquadrupeds, birds, reptiles, and men were all mere divergent descendants\r\nof a single similar original form, and even that 'one and the same kind\r\nof living filament is, and has been, the cause of organic life.'\r\n\r\nThe eighteenth century laughed, of course. It always laughed at all\r\nreformers. It said Dr. Darwin was very clever, but really a most\r\neccentric man. His 'Temple of Nature,' now, and his 'Botanic Garden,'\r\nwere vastly fine and charming poems--those sweet lines, you know, about\r\npoor Eliza!--but his zoological theories were built of course upon a\r\nmost absurd and uncertain foundation. In prose, no sensible person could\r\never take the doctor seriously. A freak of genius--nothing more; a mere\r\ndesire to seem clever and singular. But what a Nemesis the whirligig of\r\ntime has brought around with it! By a strange irony of fate, those\r\nadmired verses are now almost entirely forgotten; poor Eliza has\r\nsurvived only as our awful example of artificial pathos; and the\r\nzoological heresies, at which the eighteenth century shrugged its fat\r\nshoulders and dimpled the corners of its ample mouth, have grown to be\r\nthe chief cornerstone of all accepted modern zoological science.\r\n\r\nIn the first year of the present century, Lamarck followed Erasmus\r\nDarwin's lead with an open avowal that in his belief all animals and\r\nplants were really descended from one or a few common ancestors. He held\r\nthat organisms were just as much the result of law, not of miraculous\r\ninterposition, as suns and worlds and all the natural phenomena around\r\nus generally. He saw that what naturalists call a species differs from\r\nwhat naturalists call a variety, merely in the way of being a little\r\nmore distinctly marked, a little less like its nearest congeners\r\nelsewhere. He recognised the perfect gradation of forms by which in many\r\ncases one species after another merges into the next on either side of\r\nit. He observed the analogy between the modifications induced by man and\r\nthe modifications induced by nature. In fact, he was a thorough-going\r\nand convinced evolutionist, holding every salient opinion which Society\r\nstill believes to have been due to the works of Charles Darwin. In one\r\npoint only, a minor point to outsiders, though a point of cardinal\r\nimportance to the inner brotherhood of evolutionism, he did not\r\nanticipate his more famous successor. He thought organic evolution was\r\nwholly due to the direct action of surrounding circumstances, to the\r\nintercrossing of existing forms, and above all to the actual efforts of\r\nanimals themselves. In other words, he had not discovered natural\r\nselection, the cardinal idea of Charles Darwin's epoch-making book. For\r\nhim, the giraffe had acquired its long neck by constant reaching up to\r\nthe boughs of trees; the monkey had acquired its opposable thumb by\r\nconstant grasping at the neighbouring branches; and the serpent had\r\nacquired its sinuous shape by constant wriggling through the grass of\r\nthe meadows. Charles Darwin improved upon all that by his suggestive\r\nhint of survival of the fittest, and in so far, but in so far alone, he\r\nbecame the real father of modern biological evolutionism.\r\n\r\nFrom the days of Lamarck, to the day when Charles Darwin himself\r\npublished his wonderful 'Origin of Species,' this idea that plants and\r\nanimals might really have grown, instead of having been made all of a\r\npiece, kept brewing everywhere in the minds and brains of scientific\r\nthinkers. The notions which to the outside public were startlingly new\r\nwhen Darwin's book took the world by storm, were old indeed to the\r\nthinkers and workers who had long been familiar with the principle of\r\ndescent with modification and the speculations of the Lichfield doctor\r\nor the Paris philosopher. Long before Darwin wrote his great work,\r\nHerbert Spencer had put forth in plain language every idea which the\r\ndrawing-room biologists attributed to Darwin. The supporters of the\r\ndevelopment hypothesis, he said seven years earlier--yes, he called it\r\nthe 'development hypothesis' in so many words--'can show that\r\nmodification has effected and is effecting great changes in all\r\norganisms, subject to modifying influences.' They can show, he goes on\r\n(if I may venture to condense so great a thinker), that any existing\r\nplant or animal, placed under new conditions, begins to undergo adaptive\r\nchanges of form and structure; that in successive generations these\r\nchanges continue, till the plant or animal acquires totally new habits;\r\nthat in cultivated plants and domesticated animals changes of the sort\r\nhabitually occur; that the differences thus caused, as for example in\r\ndogs, are often greater than those on which species in the wild state\r\nare founded, and that throughout all organic nature there _is_ at work a\r\nmodifying influence of the same sort as that which they believed to\r\nhave caused the differences of species--'an influence which, to all\r\nappearance, would produce in the millions of years and under the great\r\nvariety of conditions which geological records imply, any amount of\r\nchange.' What is this but pure Darwinism, as the drawing-room\r\nphilosopher still understands the word? And yet it was written seven\r\nyears before Darwin published the 'Origin of Species.'\r\n\r\nThe fact is, one might draw up quite a long list of Darwinians before\r\nDarwin. Here are a few of them--Buffon, Lamarck, Goethe, Oken, Bates,\r\nWallace, Lecoq, Von Baer, Robert Chambers, Matthew, and Herbert Spencer.\r\nDepend upon it, no one man ever yet of himself discovered anything. As\r\nwell say that Luther made the German Reformation, that Lionardo made the\r\nItalian Renaissance, or that Robespierre made the French Revolution, as\r\nsay that Charles Darwin, and Charles Darwin alone, made the evolutionary\r\nmovement, even in the restricted field of life only. A thousand\r\npredecessors worked up towards him; a thousand contemporaries helped to\r\ndiffuse and to confirm his various principles.\r\n\r\nCharles Darwin added to the primitive evolutionary idea the special\r\nnotion of natural selection. That is to say, he pointed out that while\r\nplants and animals vary perpetually and vary indefinitely, all the\r\nvarieties so produced are not equally adapted to the circumstances of\r\nthe species. If the variation is a bad one, it tends to die out, because\r\nevery point of disadvantage tells against the individual in the struggle\r\nfor life. If the variation is a good one, it tends to persist, because\r\nevery point of advantage similarly tells in the individual's favour in\r\nthat ceaseless and viewless battle. It was this addition to the\r\nevolutionary concept, fortified by Darwin's powerful advocacy of the\r\ngeneral principle of descent with modification, that won over the whole\r\nworld to the 'Darwinian theory.' Before Darwin, many men of science\r\nwere evolutionists: after Darwin, all men of science became so at once,\r\nand the rest of the world is rapidly preparing to follow their\r\nleadership.\r\n\r\nAs applied to life, then, the evolutionary idea is briefly this--that\r\nplants and animals have all a natural origin from a single primitive\r\nliving creature, which itself was the product of light and heat acting\r\non the special chemical constituents of an ancient ocean. Starting from\r\nthat single early form, they have gone on developing ever since, from\r\nthe homogeneous to the heterogeneous, assuming ever more varied shapes,\r\ntill at last they have reached their present enormous variety of tree,\r\nand shrub, and herb, and seaweed, of beast, and bird, and fish, and\r\ncreeping insect. Evolution throughout has been one and continuous, from\r\nnebula to sun, from gas-cloud to planet, from early jelly-speck to man\r\nor elephant. So at least evolutionists say--and of course they ought to\r\nknow most about it.\r\n\r\nBut evolution, according to the evolutionists, does not even stop here.\r\nPsychology as well as biology has also its evolutionary explanation:\r\nmind is concerned as truly as matter. If the bodies of animals are\r\nevolved, their minds must be evolved likewise. Herbert Spencer and his\r\nfollowers have been mainly instrumental in elucidating this aspect of\r\nthe case. They have shown, or they have tried to show (for I don't want\r\nto dogmatise on the subject), how mind is gradually built up from the\r\nsimplest raw elements of sense and feeling; how emotions and intellect\r\nslowly arise; how the action of the environment on the organism begets a\r\nnervous system of ever greater and greater complexity, culminating at\r\nlast in the brain of a Newton, a Shakespeare, or a Mendelssohn. Step by\r\nstep, nerves have built themselves up out of the soft tissues as\r\nchannels of communication between part and part. Sense-organs of\r\nextreme simplicity have first been formed on the outside of the body,\r\nwhere it comes most into contact with external nature. Use and wont have\r\nfashioned them through long ages into organs of taste and smell and\r\ntouch; pigment spots, sensitive to light or shade, have grown by\r\ninfinite gradations into the human eye or into the myriad facets of bee\r\nand beetle; tremulous nerve-ends, responsive sympathetically to waves of\r\nsound, have tuned themselves at last into a perfect gamut in the\r\ndeveloped ear of men and mammals. Meanwhile corresponding percipient\r\ncentres have grown up in the brain, so that the coloured picture flashed\r\nby an external scene upon the eye is telegraphed from the sensitive\r\nmirror of the retina, through the many-stranded cable of the optic\r\nnerve, straight up to the appropriate headquarters in the thinking\r\nbrain. Stage by stage the continuous process has gone on unceasingly,\r\nfrom the jelly-fish with its tiny black specks of eyes, through infinite\r\nsteps of progression, induced by ever-widening intercourse with the\r\nouter world, to the final outcome in the senses and the emotions, the\r\nintellect and the will, of civilised man. Mind begins as a vague\r\nconsciousness of touch or pressure on the part of some primitive,\r\nshapeless, soft creature: it ends as an organised and co-ordinated\r\nreflection of the entire physical and psychical universe on the part of\r\na great cosmical philosopher.\r\n\r\nLast of all, like diners-out at dessert, the evolutionists take to\r\npolitics. Having shown us entirely to their own satisfaction the growth\r\nof suns, and systems, and worlds, and continents, and oceans, and\r\nplants, and animals, and minds, they proceed to show us the exactly\r\nanalogous and parallel growth of communities, and nations, and\r\nlanguages, and religions, and customs, and arts, and institutions, and\r\nliteratures. Man, the evolving savage, as Tylor, Lubbock, and others\r\nhave proved for us, slowly putting off his brute aspect derived from his\r\nearly ape-like ancestors, learned by infinitesimal degrees the use of\r\nfire, the mode of manufacturing stone hatchets and flint arrowheads, the\r\nearliest beginnings of the art of pottery. With drill or flint he became\r\nthe Prometheus to his own small heap of sticks and dry leaves among the\r\ntertiary forests. By his nightly camp-fire he beat out gradually his\r\nexcited gesture-language and his oral speech. He tamed the dog, the\r\nhorse, the cow, the camel. He taught himself to hew small clearings in\r\nthe woodland, and to plant the banana, the yam, the bread-fruit, and the\r\ncoco-nut. He picked and improved the seeds of his wild cereals till he\r\nmade himself from grass-like grains his barley, his oats, his wheat, his\r\nIndian corn. In time, he dug out ore from mines, and learnt the use\r\nfirst of gold, next of silver, then of copper, tin, bronze, and iron.\r\nSide by side with these long secular changes, he evolved the family,\r\ncommunal or patriarchal, polygamic or monogamous. He built the hut, the\r\nhouse, and the palace. He clothed or adorned himself first in skins and\r\nleaves and feathers; next in woven wool and fibre; last of all in purple\r\nand fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day. He gathered into\r\nhordes, tribes, and nations; he chose himself a king, gave himself laws,\r\nand built up great empires in Egypt, Assyria, China, and Peru. He raised\r\nhim altars, Stonehenges and Karnaks. His picture-writing grew into\r\nhieroglyphs and cuneiforms, and finally emerged, by imperceptible steps,\r\ninto alphabetic symbols, the raw material of the art of printing. His\r\ndug-out canoe culminates in the iron-clad and the 'Great Eastern'; his\r\nboomerang and slingstone in the Woolwich infant; his boiling pipkin and\r\nhis wheeled car in the locomotive engine; his picture-message in the\r\ntelephone and the Atlantic cable. Here, where the course of evolution\r\nhas really been most marvellous, its steps have been all more distinctly\r\nhistorical; so that nobody now doubts the true descent of Italian,\r\nFrench, and Spanish from provincial Latin, or the successive growth of\r\nthe trireme, the 'Great Harry,' the 'Victory,' and the 'Minotaur' from\r\nthe coracles or praus of prehistoric antiquity.\r\n\r\nThe grand conception of the uniform origin and development of all\r\nthings, earthly or sidereal, thus summed up for us in the one word\r\nevolution, belongs by right neither to Charles Darwin nor to any other\r\nsingle thinker. It is the joint product of innumerable workers, all\r\nworking up, though some of them unconsciously, towards a grand final\r\nunified philosophy of the cosmos. In astronomy, Kant, Laplace, and the\r\nHerschels; in geology, Hutton, Lyell, and the Geikies; in biology,\r\nBuffon, Lamarck, the Darwins, Huxley, and Spencer; in psychology,\r\nSpencer, Romanes, Sully, and Ribot; in sociology, Spencer, Tylor,\r\nLubbock, and De Mortillet--these have been the chief evolutionary\r\nteachers and discoverers. But the use of the word evolution itself, and\r\nthe establishment of the general evolutionary theory as a system of\r\nphilosophy applicable to the entire universe, we owe to one man\r\nalone--Herbert Spencer. Many other minds--from Galileo and Copernicus,\r\nfrom Kepler and Newton, from Linnæus and Tournefort, from D'Alembert and\r\nDiderot, nay, even, in a sense, from Aristotle and Lucretius--had been\r\npiling together the vast collection of raw material from which that\r\ngreat and stately superstructure was to be finally edified. But the\r\narchitect who placed each block in its proper niche, who planned and\r\ndesigned the whole elevation, who planted the building firmly on the\r\nrock and poised the coping-stone on the topmost pinnacle, was the author\r\nof the 'System of Synthetic Philosophy,' and none other. It is a strange\r\nproof of how little people know about their own ideas, that among the\r\nthousands who talk glibly every day of evolution, not ten per cent. are\r\nprobably aware that both word and conception are alike due to the\r\ncommanding intelligence and vast generalising power of Herbert Spencer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRICTLY INCOG.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the reefs of rock upon the Australian coast, an explorer's dredge\r\noften brings up to the surface some tangled tresses of reddish seaweed,\r\nwhich, when placed for a while in a bucket of water, begin slowly to\r\nuncoil themselves as if endowed with animal life, and finally to swim\r\nabout with a gentle tremulous motion in a mute inquiring way from side\r\nto side of the pail that contains them. Looked at closely with an\r\nattentive eye, the complex moving mass gradually resolves itself into\r\ntwo parts: one a ruddy seaweed with long streaming fronds; the other, a\r\nstrangely misshapen and dishevelled pipe-fish, exactly imitating the\r\nweed itself in form and colour. When removed from the water, this queer\r\npipe-fish proves in general outline somewhat to resemble the well-known\r\nhippocampus or sea-horse of the aquariums, whose dried remains, in a\r\nmummified state, form a standing wonder in many tiny domestic museums.\r\nBut the Australian species, instead of merely mimicking the knight on a\r\nchess-board, looks rather like a hippocampus in the most advanced stage\r\nof lunacy, with its tail and fins and the appendages of its spines\r\nflattened out into long thin streaming filaments, utterly\r\nindistinguishable in hue and shape from the fucus round which the\r\ncreature clings for support with its prehensile tail. Only a rude and\r\nshapeless rough draught of a head, vaguely horse-like in contour, and\r\ninconspicuously provided with an unobtrusive snout and a pair of very\r\nunnoticeable eyes, at all suggests to the most microscopic observer its\r\nanimal nature. Taken as a whole, nobody could at first sight distinguish\r\nit in any way from the waving weed among which it vegetates.\r\n\r\nClearly, this curious Australian cousin of the Mediterranean sea-horses\r\nhas acquired so marvellous a resemblance to a bit of fucus in order to\r\ndeceive the eyes of its ever-watchful enemies, and to become\r\nindistinguishable from the uneatable weed whose colour and form it so\r\nsurprisingly imitates. Protective resemblances of the sort are extremely\r\ncommon among the pipe-fish family, and the reason why they should be so\r\nis no doubt sufficiently obvious at first sight to any reflecting\r\nmind--such, for example, as the intelligent reader's. Pipe-fish, as\r\neverybody knows, are far from giddy. They do not swim in the vortex of\r\npiscine dissipation. Being mostly small and defenceless creatures,\r\nlurking among the marine vegetation of the shoals and reefs, they are\r\nusually accustomed to cling for support by their snake-like tails to the\r\nstalks or leaves of those submerged forests. The omniscient schoolboy\r\nmust often have watched in aquariums the habits and manners of the\r\ncommon sea-horses, twisted together by their long thin bodies into one\r\ninextricable mass of living matwork, or anchored firmly with a treble\r\nserpentine coil to some projecting branch of coralline or of quivering\r\nsea-wrack. Bad swimmers by nature, utterly unarmed, and wholly\r\nundefended by protective mail, the pipe-fish generally can neither fight\r\nnor run away: and therefore they depend entirely for their lives upon\r\ntheir peculiar skulking and lurking habits. Their one mode of defence is\r\nnot to show themselves; discretion is the better part of their valour;\r\nthey hide as much as possible among the thickest seaweed, and trust to\r\nProvidence to escape observation.\r\n\r\nNow, with any animals thus constituted, cowards by hereditary\r\npredilection, it must necessarily happen that the more brightly coloured\r\nor obtrusive individuals will most readily be spotted and most\r\nunceremoniously devoured by their sharp-sighted foes, the predatory\r\nfishes. On the other hand, just in proportion as any particular\r\npipe-fish happens to display any chance resemblance in colour or\r\nappearance to the special seaweed in whose folds it lurks, to that\r\nextent will it be likely to escape detection, and to hand on its\r\npeculiarities to its future descendants. A long-continued course of the\r\nsimple process thus roughly described must of necessity result at last\r\nin the elimination of all the most conspicuous pipe-fish, and the\r\nsurvival of all those unobtrusive and retiring individuals which in any\r\nrespect happen to resemble the fucus or coralline among which they\r\ndwell. Hence, in many places, various kinds of pipe-fish exhibit an\r\nextraordinary amount of imitative likeness to the sargasso or seaweed to\r\nwhose tags they cling; and in the three most highly developed Australian\r\nspecies the likeness becomes so ridiculously close that it is with\r\ndifficulty one can persuade oneself one is really and truly looking at a\r\nfish, and not at a piece of strangely animated and locomotive fucus.\r\n\r\nOf course, the playful pipe-fish is by no means alone in his assumption\r\nof so neat and effective a disguise. Protective resemblances of just the\r\nsame sort as that thus exhibited by this extraordinary little creature\r\nare common throughout the whole range of nature; instances are to be\r\nfound in abundance, not only among beasts, birds, reptiles, and fishes,\r\nbut even among caterpillars, butterflies, and spiders, of species which\r\npreserve the strictest incognito. Everywhere in the world, animals and\r\nplants are perpetually masquerading in various assumed characters; and\r\nsometimes their make-up is so exceedingly good as to take in for a while\r\nnot merely the uninstructed ordinary observer, but even the scientific\r\nand systematic naturalist.\r\n\r\nA few selected instances of such successful masquerading will perhaps\r\nbest serve to introduce the general principles upon which all animal\r\nmimicry ultimately depends. Indeed, naturalists of late years have been\r\nlargely employed in fishing up examples from the ends of the earth and\r\nfrom the depths of the sea for the elucidation of this very subject.\r\nThere is a certain butterfly in the islands of the Malay Archipelago\r\n(its learned name, if anybody wishes to be formally introduced, is\r\n_Kallima paralekta_) which always rests among dead or dry leaves, and\r\nhas itself leaf-like wings, all spotted over at intervals with wee\r\nspeckles to imitate the tiny spots of fungi on the foliage it resembles.\r\nThe well-known stick and leaf insects from the same rich neighbourhood\r\nin like manner exactly mimic the twigs and leaves of the forest among\r\nwhich they lurk: some of them look for all the world like little bits of\r\nwalking bamboo, while others appear in all varieties of hue, as if\r\nopening buds and full-blown leaves and pieces of yellow foliage\r\nsprinkled with the tints and moulds of decay had of a sudden raised\r\nthemselves erect upon six legs, and begun incontinently to perambulate\r\nthe Malayan woodlands like vegetable Frankensteins in all their glory.\r\nThe larva of one such deceptive insect, observed in Nicaragua by\r\nsharp-eyed Mr. Belt, appeared at first sight like a mere fragment of the\r\nmoss on which it rested, its body being all prolonged into little\r\nthread-like green filaments, precisely imitating the foliage around it.\r\nOnce more, there are common flies which secure protection for themselves\r\nby growing into the counterfeit presentment of wasps or hornets, and so\r\nobtaining immunity from the attacks of birds or animals. Many of these\r\ncuriously mimetic insects are banded with yellow and black in the very\r\nimage of their stinging originals, and have their tails sharpened, _in\r\nterrorem_, into a pretended sting, to give point and verisimilitude to\r\nthe deceptive resemblance. More curious still, certain South American\r\nbutterflies of a perfectly inoffensive and edible family mimic in every\r\nspot and line of colour sundry other butterflies of an utterly unrelated\r\nand fundamentally dissimilar type, but of so disagreeable a taste as\r\nnever to be eaten by birds or lizards. The origin of these curious\r\nresemblances I shall endeavour to explain (after Messrs. Bates and\r\nWallace) a little farther on: for the present it is enough to observe\r\nthat the extraordinary resemblances thus produced have often deceived\r\nthe very elect, and have caused experienced naturalists for a time to\r\nstick some deceptive specimen of a fly among the wasps and hornets, or\r\nsome masquerading cricket into the midst of a cabinet full of saw-flies\r\nor ichneumons.\r\n\r\nLet us look briefly at the other instances of protective coloration in\r\nnature generally which lead up to these final bizarre exemplifications\r\nof the masquerading tendency.\r\n\r\nWherever all the world around is remarkably uniform in colour and\r\nappearance, all the animals, birds, and insects alike necessarily\r\ndisguise themselves in its prevailing tint to escape observation. It\r\ndoes not matter in the least whether they are predatory or defenceless,\r\nthe hunters or the hunted: if they are to escape destruction or\r\nstarvation, as the case may be, they must assume the hue of all the rest\r\nof nature about them. In the arctic snows, for example, all animals,\r\nwithout exception, must needs be snow-white. The polar bear, if he were\r\nbrown or black, would immediately be observed among the unvaried\r\nice-fields by his expected prey, and could never get a chance of\r\napproaching his quarry unperceived at close quarters. On the other hand,\r\nthe arctic hare must equally be dressed in a snow-white coat, or the\r\narctic fox would too readily discover him and pounce down upon him\r\noff-hand; while, conversely, the fox himself, if red or brown, could\r\nnever creep upon the unwary hare without previous detection, which would\r\ndefeat his purpose. For this reason, the ptarmigan and the willow grouse\r\nbecome as white in winter as the vast snow-fields under which they\r\nburrow; the ermine changes his dusky summer coat for the expensive\r\nwintry suit beloved of British Themis; the snow-bunting acquires his\r\nmilk-white plumage; and even the weasel assimilates himself more or less\r\nin hue to the unvarying garb of arctic nature. To be out of the fashion\r\nis there quite literally to be out of the world: no half-measures will\r\nsuit the stern decree of polar biology; strict compliance with the law\r\nof winter change is absolutely necessary to success in the struggle for\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nNow, how has this curious uniformity of dress in arctic animals been\r\nbrought about? Why, simply by that unyielding principle of Nature which\r\ncondemns the less adapted for ever to extinction, and exalts the better\r\nadapted to the high places of her hierarchy in their stead. The\r\nptarmigan and the snow-buntings that look most like the snow have for\r\nages been least likely to attract the unfavourable attention of arctic\r\nfox or prowling ermine; the fox or ermine that came most silently and\r\nmost unperceived across the shifting drifts has been most likely to\r\nsteal unawares upon the heedless flocks of ptarmigan and snow-bunting.\r\nIn the one case protective colouring preserves the animal from himself\r\nbeing devoured; in the other case it enables him the more easily to\r\ndevour others. And since 'Eat or be eaten' is the shrill sentence of\r\nNature upon all animal life, the final result is the unbroken whiteness\r\nof the arctic fauna in all its developments of fur or feather.\r\n\r\nWhere the colouring of nature is absolutely uniform, as among the arctic\r\nsnows or the chilly mountain tops, the colouring of the animals is\r\nuniform too. Where it is slightly diversified from point to point, as in\r\nthe sands of the desert, the animals that imitate it are speckled or\r\ndiversified with various soft neutral tints. All the birds, reptiles,\r\nand insects of Sahara, says Canon Tristram, copy closely the grey or\r\nisabelline colour of the boundless sands that stretch around them. Lord\r\nGeorge Campbell, in his amusing 'Log Letters from the \"Challenger,\"'\r\nmentions a butterfly on the shore at Amboyna which looked exactly like a\r\nbit of the beach, until it spread its wings and fluttered away gaily to\r\nleeward. Soles and other flat-fish similarly resemble the sands or banks\r\non which they lie, and accommodate themselves specifically to the\r\nparticular colour of their special bottom. Thus the flounder imitates\r\nthe muddy bars at the mouths of rivers, where he loves to half bury\r\nhimself in the congenial ooze; the sole, who rather affects clean hard\r\nsand-banks, is simply sandy and speckled with grey; the plaice, who goes\r\nin by preference for a bed of mixed pebbles, has red and yellow spots\r\nscattered up and down irregularly among the brown, to look as much as\r\npossible like agates and carnelians: the brill, who hugs a still rougher\r\nledge, has gone so far as to acquire raised lumps or tubercles on his\r\nupper surface, which make him seem like a mere bit of the shingle-strewn\r\nrock on which he reposes. In short, where the environment is most\r\nuniform the colouring follows suit: just in proportion as the\r\nenvironment varies from place to place, the colouring must vary in order\r\nto simulate it. There is a deep biological joy in the term\r\n'environment'; it almost rivals the well-known consolatory properties of\r\nthat sweet word 'Mesopotamia.' 'Surroundings,' perhaps, would equally\r\nwell express the meaning, but then, as Mr. Wordsworth justly observes,\r\n'the difference to me!'\r\n\r\nBetween England and the West Indies, about the time when one begins to\r\nrecover from the first bout of sea-sickness, we come upon a certain\r\nsluggish tract of ocean, uninvaded by either Gulf Stream or arctic\r\ncurrent, but slowly stagnating in a sort of endless eddy of its own, and\r\nknown to sailors and books of physical geography as the Sargasso Sea.\r\nThe sargasso or floating seaweed from which it takes its poetical name\r\nis a pretty yellow rootless alga, swimming in vast quantities on the\r\nsurface of the water, and covered with tiny bladder-like bodies which at\r\nfirst sight might easily be mistaken for amber berries. If you drop a\r\nbucket over the ship's side and pull up a tangled mass of this beautiful\r\nseaweed, it will seem at first to be all plant alike; but, when you come\r\nto examine its tangles closely, you will find that it simply swarms with\r\ntiny crabs, fishes, and shrimps, all coloured so precisely to shade that\r\nthey look exactly like the sargasso itself. Here the colour about is\r\nless uniform than in the arctic snows, but, so far as the\r\nsargasso-haunting animals are concerned, it comes pretty much to the\r\nsame thing. The floating mass of weed is their whole world, and they\r\nhave had to accommodate themselves to its tawny hue under pain of death,\r\nimmediate and violent.\r\n\r\nCaterpillars and butterflies often show us a further step in advance in\r\nthe direction of minute imitation of ordinary surroundings. Dr. Weismann\r\nhas published a very long and learned memoir, fraught with the best\r\nGerman erudition and prolixity, upon this highly interesting and obscure\r\nsubject. As English readers, however, not unnaturally object to trudging\r\nthrough a stout volume on the larva of the sphinx moth, conceived in the\r\nspirit of those patriarchal ages of Hilpa and Shalum, when man lived to\r\nnine hundred and ninety-nine years, and devoted a stray century or so\r\nwithout stint to the work of education, I shall not refer them to Dr.\r\nWeismann's original treatise, as well translated and still further\r\nenlarged by Mr. Raphael Meldola, but will present them instead with a\r\nbrief _résumé_, boiled down and condensed into a patent royal elixir of\r\nlearning. Your caterpillar, then, runs many serious risks in early life\r\nfrom the annoying persistence of sundry evil-disposed birds, who insist\r\nat inconvenient times in picking him off the leaves of gooseberry bushes\r\nand other his chosen places of residence. His infant mortality, indeed,\r\nis something simply appalling, and it is only by laying the eggs that\r\nproduce him in enormous quantities that his fond mother the butterfly\r\never succeeds in rearing on an average two of her brood to replace the\r\nimago generation just departed. Accordingly, the caterpillar has been\r\nforced by adverse circumstances to assume the most ridiculous and\r\nimpossible disguises, appearing now in the shape of a leaf or stem, now\r\nas a bundle of dark-green pine needles, and now again as a bud or\r\nflower, all for the innocent purpose of concealing his whereabouts from\r\nthe inquisitive gaze of the birds his enemies.\r\n\r\nWhen the caterpillar lives on a plant like a grass, the ribs or veins of\r\nwhich run up and down longitudinally, he is usually striped or streaked\r\nwith darker lines in the same direction as those on his native foliage.\r\nWhen, on the contrary, he lives upon broader leaves, provided with a\r\nmidrib and branching veins, his stripes and streaks (not to be out of\r\nthe fashion) run transversely and obliquely, at exactly the same angle\r\nas those of his wonted food-plant. Very often, if you take a green\r\ncaterpillar of this sort away from his natural surroundings, you will be\r\nsurprised at the conspicuousness of his pale lilac or mauve markings;\r\nsurely, you will think to yourself, such very distinct variegation as\r\nthat must betray him instantly to his watchful enemies. But no; if you\r\nreplace him gently where you first found him, you will see that the\r\nlines exactly harmonise with the joints and shading of his native leaf:\r\nthey are delicate representations of the soft shadow cast by a rib or\r\nvein, and the local colour is precisely what a painter would have had to\r\nuse in order to produce the corresponding effect. The shadow of\r\nyellowish green is, of course, always purplish or lilac. It may at first\r\nsight seem surprising that a caterpillar should possess so much artistic\r\nsense and dexterity; but then the penalty for bungling or inharmonious\r\nwork is so very severe as necessarily to stimulate his imitative genius.\r\nBirds are for ever hunting him down among the green leaves, and only\r\nthose caterpillars which effectually deceive them by their admirable\r\nimitations can ever hope to survive and become the butterflies who hand\r\non their larval peculiarities to after ages. Need I add that the\r\nvariations are, of course, unconscious, and that accident in the first\r\nplace is ultimately answerable for each fresh step in the direction of\r\nstill closer simulation?\r\n\r\nThe geometric moths have brown caterpillars, which generally stand erect\r\nwhen at rest on the branches of trees and so resemble small twigs; and,\r\nin order that the resemblance may be the more striking, they are often\r\ncovered with tiny warts which look like buds or knots upon the surface.\r\nThe larva of that familiar and much-dreaded insect, the death's-head\r\nhawk-moth, feeds as a rule on the foliage of the potato, and its very\r\nvaried colouring, as Sir John Lubbock has pointed out, so beautifully\r\nharmonises with the brown of the earth, the yellow and green of the\r\nleaves, and the faint purplish blue of the lurid flowers, that it can\r\nonly be distinguished when the eye happens accidentally to focus itself\r\nexactly upon the spot occupied by the unobtrusive caterpillar. Other\r\nlarvæ which frequent pine trees have their bodies covered with tufts of\r\ngreen hairs that serve to imitate the peculiar pine foliage. One queer\r\nlittle caterpillar, which lives upon the hoary foliage of the\r\nsea-buckthorn, has a grey-green body, just like the buckthorn leaves,\r\nrelieved by a very conspicuous red spot which really represents in size\r\nand colour one of the berries that grow around it. Finally the larva of\r\nthe elephant hawk-moth, which grows to a very large size, has a pair of\r\nhuge spots that seem like great eyes; and direct experiment establishes\r\nthe fact that small birds mistake it for a young snake, and stand in\r\nterrible awe of it accordingly, though it is in reality a perfectly\r\nharmless insect, and also, as I am credibly informed (for I cannot speak\r\nupon the point from personal experience), a very tasty and\r\nwell-flavoured insect, and 'quite good to eat' too, says an eminent\r\nauthority. One of these big snake-like caterpillars once frightened Mr.\r\nBates himself on the banks of the Amazon.\r\n\r\nNow, I know that cantankerous person, the universal objector, has all\r\nalong been bursting to interrupt me and declare that he himself\r\nfrequently finds no end of caterpillars, and has not the slightest\r\ndifficulty at all in distinguishing them with the naked eye from the\r\nleaves and plants among which they are lurking. But observe how promptly\r\nwe crush and demolish this very inconvenient and disconcerting critic.\r\nThe caterpillars _he_ finds are almost all hairy ones, very conspicuous\r\nand easy to discover--'woolly bears,' and such like common and unclean\r\ncreatures--and the reason they take no pains to conceal themselves from\r\nhis unobservant eyes is simply this: nobody on earth wants to discover\r\nthem. For either they are protectively encased in horrid hairs, which\r\nget down your throat and choke you and bother you (I speak as a bird,\r\nfrom the point of view of a confirmed caterpillar eater), or else they\r\nare bitter and nasty to the taste, like the larva of the spurge moth and\r\nthe machaon butterfly. These are the ordinary brown and red and banded\r\ncaterpillars that the critical objector finds in hundreds on his\r\nperegrinations about his own garden--commonplace things which the\r\nexperienced naturalist has long since got utterly tired of. But has\r\nyour rash objector ever lighted upon that rare larva which lives among\r\nthe periwinkles, and exactly imitates a periwinkle petal? Has he ever\r\ndiscovered those deceptive creatures which pretend for all the world to\r\nbe leaves of lady's-bedstraw, or dress themselves up as flowers of\r\nbuttonweed? Has he ever hit upon those immoral caterpillars which\r\nwriggle through life upon the false pretence that they are only the\r\nshadows of projecting ribs on the under surface of a full-grown lime\r\nleaf? No, not he; he passes them all by without one single glance of\r\nrecognition; and when the painstaking naturalist who has hunted them\r\nevery one down with lens and butterfly net ventures tentatively to\r\ndescribe their personal appearance, he comes up smiling with his great\r\nrusset woolly bear comfortably nestling upon a green cabbage leaf, and\r\nasks you in a voice of triumphant demonstration, where is the trace of\r\nconcealment or disguise in that amiable but very inedible insect? Go to,\r\nSir Critic, I will have none of you; I only use you for a metaphorical\r\nmarionette to set up and knock down again, as Mr. Punch in the street\r\nshow knocks down the policeman who comes to arrest him, and the grimy\r\nblack personage of sulphurous antecedents who pops up with a fizz\r\nthrough the floor of his apartment.\r\n\r\nQueerer still than the caterpillars which pretend to be leaves or\r\nflowers for the sake of protection are those truly diabolical and\r\nperfidious Brazilian spiders which, as Mr. Bates observed, are\r\nbrilliantly coloured with crimson and purple, but 'double themselves up\r\nat the base of leaf-stalks, so as to resemble flower buds, and thus\r\ndeceive the insects upon which they prey.' There is something hideously\r\nwicked and cruel in this lowest depth of imitative infamy. A flower-bud\r\nis something so innocent and childlike; and to disguise oneself as such\r\nfor purposes of murder and rapine argues the final abyss of arachnoid\r\nperfidy. It reminds one of that charming and amiable young lady in Mr.\r\nRobert Louis Stevenson's 'Dynamiter,' who amused herself in moments of\r\ntemporary gaiety by blowing up inhabited houses, inmates and all, out of\r\npure lightness of heart and girlish frivolity. An Indian mantis or\r\npraying insect, a little less wicked, though no less cruel than the\r\nspiders, deceives the flies who come to his arms under the false\r\npretence of being a quiet leaf, upon which they may light in safety for\r\nrest and refreshment. Yet another abandoned member of the same family,\r\nrelying boldly upon the resources of tropical nature, gets itself up as\r\na complete orchid, the head and fangs being moulded in the exact image\r\nof the beautiful blossom, and the arms folding treacherously around the\r\nunhappy insect which ventures to seek for honey in its deceptive jaws.\r\n\r\nHappily, however, the tyrants and murderers do not always have things\r\nall their own way. Sometimes the inoffensive prey turn the tables upon\r\ntheir torturers with distinguished success. For example, Mr. Wallace\r\nnoticed a kind of sand-wasp, in Borneo, much given to devouring\r\ncrickets; but there was one species of cricket which exactly reproduced\r\nthe features of the sand-wasps, and mixed among them on equal terms\r\nwithout fear of detection. Mr. Belt saw a green leaf-like locust in\r\nNicaragua, overrun by foraging ants in search of meat for dinner, but\r\nremaining perfectly motionless all the time, and evidently mistaken by\r\nthe hungry foragers for a real piece of the foliage it mimicked. So\r\nthoroughly did this innocent locust understand the necessity for\r\nremaining still, and pretending to be a leaf under all advances, that\r\neven when Mr. Belt took it up in his hands it never budged an inch, but\r\nstrenuously preserved its rigid leaf-like attitude. As other insects\r\n'sham dead,' this ingenious creature shammed vegetable.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand how cases like these begin to arise, we must\r\nremember that first of all they start of necessity from very slight and\r\nindefinite resemblances, which succeed as it were by accident in\r\noccasionally eluding the vigilance of enemies. Thus, there are stick\r\ninsects which only look like long round cylinders, not obviously\r\nstick-shaped, but rudely resembling a bit of wood in outline only. These\r\nimperfectly mimetic insects may often obtain a casual immunity from\r\nattack by being mistaken for a twig by birds or lizards. There are\r\nothers, again, in which natural selection has gone a step further, so as\r\nto produce upon their bodies bark-like colouring and rough patches which\r\nimitate knots, wrinkles, and leaf-buds. In these cases the protection\r\ngiven is far more marked, and the chances of detection are\r\nproportionately lessened. But sharp-eyed birds, with senses quickened by\r\nhunger, the true mother of invention, must learn at last to pierce such\r\nflimsy disguises, and suspect a stick insect in the most\r\ninnocent-looking and apparently rigid twigs. The final step, therefore,\r\nconsists in the production of that extraordinary actor, the _Xeroxylus\r\nlaceratus_, whose formidable name means no more than 'ragged dry-stick,'\r\nand which really mimics down to the minutest particular a broken twig,\r\novergrown with mosses, liverworts, and lichens.\r\n\r\nTake, on the other hand, the well-known case of that predaceous mantis\r\nwhich exactly imitates the white ants, and, mixing with them like one of\r\ntheir own horde, quietly devours a stray fat termite or so, from time to\r\ntime, as occasion offers. Here we must suppose that the ancestral mantis\r\nhappened to be somewhat paler and smaller than most of its\r\nfellow-tribesmen, and so at times managed unobserved to mingle with the\r\nwhite ants, especially in the shade or under a dusky sky, much to the\r\nadvantage of its own appetite. But the termites would soon begin to\r\nobserve the visits of their suspicious friend, and to note their\r\ncoincidence with the frequent mysterious disappearance of a\r\nfellow-townswoman, evaporated into space, like the missing young women\r\nin neat cloth jackets who periodically vanish from the London suburbs.\r\nIn proportion as their reasonable suspicions increased, the termites\r\nwould carefully avoid all doubtful looking mantises; but, at the same\r\ntime, they would only succeed in making the mantises which survived\r\ntheir inquisition grow more and more closely to resemble the termite\r\npattern in all particulars. For any mantis which happened to come a\r\nlittle nearer the white ants in hue or shape would thereby be enabled to\r\nmake a more secure meal upon his unfortunate victims; and so the very\r\nvigilance which the ants exerted against his vile deception would itself\r\nreact in time against their own kind, by leaving only the most ruthless\r\nand indistinguishable of their foes to become the parents of future\r\ngenerations of mantises.\r\n\r\nOnce more, the beetles and flies of Central America must have learned by\r\nexperience to get out of the way of the nimble Central American lizards\r\nwith great agility, cunning, and alertness. But green lizards are less\r\neasy to notice beforehand than brown or red ones; and so the lizards of\r\ntropical countries are almost always bright green, with complementary\r\nshades of yellow, grey, and purple, just to fit them in with the foliage\r\nthey lurk among. Everybody who has ever hunted the green tree-toads on\r\nthe leaves of waterside plants on the Riviera must know how difficult it\r\nis to discriminate these brilliant leaf-coloured creatures from the\r\nalmost identical background on which they rest. Now, just in proportion\r\nas the beetles and flies grow still more cautious, even the green\r\nlizards themselves fail to pick up a satisfactory livelihood; and so at\r\nlast we get that most remarkable Nicaraguan form, decked all round with\r\nleaf-like expansions, and looking so like the foliage on which it rests\r\nthat no beetle on earth can possibly detect it. The more cunning you get\r\nyour detectives, the more cunning do the thieves become to outwit them.\r\n\r\nLook, again, at the curious life-history of the flies which dwell as\r\nunbidden guests or social parasites in the nests and hives of wild\r\nhoney-bees. These burglarious flies are belted and bearded in the very\r\nself-same pattern as the bumble-bees themselves; but their larvæ live\r\nupon the young grubs of the hive, and repay the unconscious hospitality\r\nof the busy workers by devouring the future hope of their unwilling\r\nhosts. Obviously, any fly which entered a bee-hive could only escape\r\ndetection and extermination at the hands (or stings) of its outraged\r\ninhabitants, provided it so far resembled the real householders as to be\r\nmistaken at a first glance by the invaded community for one of its own\r\nnumerous members. Thus any fly which showed the slightest superficial\r\nresemblance to a bee might at first be enabled to rob honey for a time\r\nwith comparative impunity, and to lay its eggs among the cells of the\r\nhelpless larvæ. But when once the vile attempt was fairly discovered,\r\nthe burglars could only escape fatal detection from generation to\r\ngeneration just in proportion as they more and more closely approximated\r\nto the shape and colour of the bees themselves. For, as Mr. Belt has\r\nwell pointed out, while the mimicking species would become naturally\r\nmore numerous from age to age, the senses of the mimicked species would\r\ngrow sharper and sharper by constant practice in detecting and punishing\r\nthe unwelcome intruders.\r\n\r\nIt is only in external matters, however, that the appearance of such\r\nmimetic species can ever be altered. Their underlying points of\r\nstructure and formative detail always show to the very end (if only one\r\nhappens to observe them) their proper place in a scientific\r\nclassification. For instance, these same parasitic flies which so\r\nclosely resemble bees in their shape and colour have only one pair of\r\nwings apiece, like all the rest of the fly order, while the bees of\r\ncourse have the full complement of two pairs, an upper and an under,\r\npossessed by them in common with all other well-conducted members of the\r\nhymenopterous family. So, too, there is a certain curious American\r\ninsect, belonging to the very unsavoury tribe which supplies London\r\nlodging-houses with one of their most familiar entomological specimens;\r\nand this cleverly disguised little creature is banded and striped in\r\nevery part exactly like a local hornet, for whom it evidently wishes\r\nitself to be mistaken. If you were travelling in the wilder parts of\r\nColorado you would find a close resemblance to Buffalo Bill was no mean\r\npersonal protection. Hornets, in fact, are insects to which birds and\r\nother insectivorous animals prefer to give a very wide berth, and the\r\nreason why they should be imitated by a defenceless beetle must be\r\nobvious to the intelligent student. But while the vibrating wing-cases\r\nof this deceptive masquerader are made to look as thin and hornet-like\r\nas possible, in all underlying points of structure any competent\r\nnaturalist would see at once that the creature must really be classed\r\namong the noisome Hemiptera. I seldom trouble the public with a Greek or\r\nLatin name, but on this occasion I trust I may be pardoned for not\r\nindulging in all the ingenuous bluntness of the vernacular.\r\n\r\nSometimes this effective mimicry of stinging insects seems to be even\r\nconsciously performed by the tiny actors. Many creatures, which do not\r\nthemselves possess stings, nevertheless endeavour to frighten their\r\nenemies by assuming the characteristic hostile attitudes of wasps or\r\nhornets. Everybody in England must be well acquainted with those common\r\nBritish earwig-looking insects, popularly known as the devil's\r\ncoach-horses, which, when irritated or interfered with, cock up their\r\ntails behind them in the most aggressive fashion, exactly reproducing\r\nthe threatening action of an angry scorpion. Now, as a matter of fact,\r\nthe devil's coach-horse is quite harmless, but I have often seen, not\r\nonly little boys and girls, but also chickens, small birds, and\r\nshrew-mice, evidently alarmed at his minatory attitude. So, too, the\r\nbumble-bee flies, which are inoffensive insects got up in sedulous\r\nimitation of various species of wild bee, flit about and buzz angrily in\r\nthe sunlight, quite after the fashion of the insects they mimic; and\r\nwhen disturbed they pretend to get excited, and seem as if they wished\r\nto fly in their assailant's face and roundly sting him. This curious\r\ninstinct may be put side by side with the parallel instinct of shamming\r\ndead, possessed by many beetles and other small defenceless species.\r\n\r\nCertain beetles have also been modified so as exactly to imitate wasps;\r\nand in these cases the beetle waist, usually so solid, thick, and\r\nclumsy, grows as slender and graceful as if the insects had been\r\nsupplied with corsets by a fashionable West End house. But the greatest\r\nrefinement of all is perhaps that noticed in certain allied species\r\nwhich mimic bees, and which have acquired useless little tufts of hair\r\non their hind shanks to represent the dilated and tufted\r\npollen-gathering apparatus of the true bees.\r\n\r\nI have left to the last the most marvellous cases of mimicry of\r\nall--those noticed among South American butterflies by Mr. Bates, who\r\nfound that certain edible kinds exactly resembled a handsome and\r\nconspicuous but bitter-tasted species 'in every shade and stripe of\r\ncolour.' Several of these South American imitative insects long deceived\r\nthe very entomologists; and it was only by a close inspection of their\r\nstructural differences that the utter distinctness of the mimickers and\r\nthe mimicked was satisfactorily settled. Scarcely less curious is the\r\ncase of Mr. Wallace's Malayan orioles, two species of which exactly copy\r\ntwo pugnacious honey-suckers in every detail of plumage and coloration.\r\nAs the honey-suckers are avoided by birds of prey, owing to their\r\nsurprising strength and pugnacity, the orioles gain immunity from attack\r\nby their close resemblance to the protected species. When Dr. Sclater,\r\nthe distinguished ornithologist, was examining Mr. Forbes's collections\r\nfrom Timorlaut, even his experienced eye was so taken in by another of\r\nthese deceptive bird-mimicries that he classified two birds of totally\r\ndistinct families as two different individuals of the same species.\r\n\r\nEven among plants a few instances of true mimicry have been observed. In\r\nthe stony African Karoo, where every plant is eagerly sought out for\r\nfood by the scanty local fauna, there are tubers which exactly resemble\r\nthe pebbles around them; and I have little doubt that our perfectly\r\nharmless English dead-nettle secures itself from the attacks of browsing\r\nanimals by its close likeness to the wholly unrelated, but\r\nwell-protected, stinging-nettle.\r\n\r\nFinally, we must not forget the device of those animals which not merely\r\nassimilate themselves in colour to the ordinary environment in a general\r\nway, but have also the power of adapting themselves at will to whatever\r\nobject they may happen to lie against. Cases like that of the ptarmigan,\r\nwhich in summer harmonises with the brown heather and grey rock, while\r\nin winter it changes to the white of the snow-fields, lead us up\r\ngradually to such ultimate results of the masquerading tendency. There\r\nis a tiny crustacean, the chameleon shrimp, which can alter its hue to\r\nthat of any material on which it happens to rest. On a sandy bottom it\r\nappears grey or sand-coloured; when lurking among seaweed it becomes\r\ngreen, or red, or brown, according to the nature of its momentary\r\nbackground. Probably the effect is quite unconscious, or at least\r\ninvoluntary, like blushing with ourselves--and nobody ever blushes on\r\npurpose, though they do say a distinguished poet once complained that an\r\neminent actor did not follow his stage directions because he omitted to\r\nobey the rubrical remark, 'Here Harold purples with anger.' The change\r\nis produced by certain automatic muscles which force up particular\r\npigment cells above the others, green coming to the top on a green\r\nsurface, red on a ruddy one, and brown or grey where the circumstances\r\ndemand them. Many kinds of fish similarly alter their colour to suit\r\ntheir background by forcing forward or backward certain special\r\npigment-cells known as chromatophores, whose various combinations\r\nproduce at will almost any required tone or shade. Almost all reptiles\r\nand amphibians possess the power of changing their hue in accordance\r\nwith their environment in a very high degree; and among certain\r\ntree-toads and frogs it is difficult to say what is the normal\r\ncolouring, as they vary indefinitely from buff and dove-colour to\r\nchocolate-brown, rose, and even lilac.\r\n\r\nBut of all the particoloured reptiles the chameleon is by far the best\r\nknown, and on the whole the most remarkable for his inconstancy of\r\ncoloration. Like a lacertine Vicar of Bray, he varies incontinently from\r\nbuff to blue, and from blue back to orange again, under stress of\r\ncircumstances. The mechanism of this curious change is extremely\r\ncomplex. Tiny corpuscles of different pigments are sometimes hidden in\r\nthe depths of the chameleon's skin, and sometimes spread out on its\r\nsurface in an interlacing network of brown or purple. In addition to\r\nthis prime colouring matter, however, the animal also possesses a normal\r\nyellow pigment, and a bluish layer in the skin which acts like the\r\niridium glass so largely employed by Dr. Salviati, being seen as\r\nstraw-coloured with a transmitted light, but assuming a faint lilac tint\r\nagainst an opaque absorbent surface. While sleeping the chameleon\r\nbecomes almost white in the shade, but if light falls upon him he slowly\r\ndarkens by an automatic process. The movements of the corpuscles are\r\ngoverned by opposite nerves and muscles, which either cause them to bury\r\nthemselves under the true skin, or to form an opaque ground behind the\r\nblue layer, or to spread out in a ramifying mass on the outer surface,\r\nand so produce as desired almost any necessary shade of grey, green,\r\nblack, or yellow. It is an interesting fact that many chrysalids undergo\r\nprecisely similar changes of colour in adaptation to the background\r\nagainst which they suspend themselves, being grey on a grey surface,\r\ngreen on a green one, and even half black and half red when hung up\r\nagainst pieces of particoloured paper.\r\n\r\nNothing could more beautifully prove the noble superiority of the human\r\nintellect than the fact that while our grouse are russet-brown to suit\r\nthe bracken and heather, and our caterpillars green to suit the lettuce\r\nand the cabbage leaves, our British soldier should be wisely coated in\r\nbrilliant scarlet to form an effective mark for the rifles of an enemy.\r\nRed is the easiest of all colours at which to aim from a great distance;\r\nand its selection by authority for the uniform of unfortunate Tommy\r\nAtkins reminds me of nothing so much as Mr. McClelland's exquisite\r\nsuggestion that the peculiar brilliancy of the Indian river carps makes\r\nthem serve 'as a better mark for kingfishers, terns, and other birds\r\nwhich are destined to keep the number of these fishes in check.' The\r\nidea of Providence and the Horse Guards conspiring to render any\r\ncreature an easier target for the attacks of enemies is worthy of the\r\ndecadent school of natural history, and cannot for a moment be\r\ndispassionately considered by a judicious critic. Nowadays we all know\r\nthat the carp are decked in crimson and blue to please their partners,\r\nand that soldiers are dressed in brilliant red to please the æsthetic\r\nauthorities who command them from a distance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEVEN-YEAR SLEEPERS\r\n\r\n\r\nFor many generations past that problematical animal, the toad-in-a-hole\r\n(literal, not culinary) has been one of the most familiar and\r\ninteresting personages of contemporary folk-lore and popular natural\r\nhistory. From time to time he turns up afresh, with his own wonted\r\nperennial vigour, on paper at least, in company with the great\r\nsea-serpent, the big gooseberry, the shower of frogs, the two-headed\r\ncalf, and all the other common objects of the country or the seaside in\r\nthe silly season. No extraordinary natural phenomenon on earth was ever\r\nbetter vouched for--in the fashion rendered familiar to us by the\r\nTichborne claimant--that is to say, no other could ever get a larger\r\nnumber of unprejudiced witnesses to swear positively and unreservedly in\r\nits favour. Unfortunately, however, swearing alone no longer settles\r\ncauses off-hand, as if by show of hands, 'the Ayes have it,' after the\r\nfashion prevalent in the good old days when the whole Hundred used to\r\ntestify that of its certain knowledge John Nokes did not commit such and\r\nsuch a murder; whereupon John Nokes was forthwith acquitted accordingly.\r\nNowadays, both justice and science have become more exacting; they\r\ninsist upon the unpleasant and discourteous habit of cross-examining\r\ntheir witnesses (as if they doubted them, forsooth!), instead of\r\naccepting the witnesses' own simple assertion that it's all right, and\r\nthere's no need for making a fuss about it. Did you yourself see the\r\nblock of stone in which the toad is said to have been found, before the\r\ntoad himself was actually extracted? Did you examine it all round to\r\nmake quite sure there was no hole, or crack, or passage in it anywhere?\r\nDid you satisfy yourself after the toad was released from his close\r\nquarters that no such hole, or crack, or passage had been dexterously\r\nclosed up, with intent to deceive, by plaster, cement, or other\r\nartificial composition? Did you ever offer the workmen who found it a\r\nnominal reward--say five shillings--for the first perfectly unanswerable\r\nspecimen of a genuine unadulterated antediluvian toad? Have you got the\r\ntoad now present, and can you produce him here in court (on writ of\r\n_habeas corpus_ or otherwise), together with all the fragments of the\r\nstone or tree from which he was extracted? These are the disagreeable,\r\nprying, inquisitorial, I may even say insulting, questions with which a\r\nmodern man of science is ready to assail the truthful and reputable\r\ngentlemen who venture to assert their discovery, in these degenerate\r\ndays, of the ancient and unsophisticated toad-in-a-hole.\r\n\r\nNow, the worst of it is that the gentlemen in question, being unfamiliar\r\nwith what is technically described as scientific methods of\r\ninvestigation, are very apt to lose their temper when thus\r\ncross-questioned, and to reply, after the fashion usually attributed to\r\nthe female mind, with another question, whether the scientific person\r\nwishes to accuse them of downright lying. And as nothing on earth could\r\nbe further from the scientific person's mind than such an imputation, he\r\nis usually fain in the end to give up the social pursuit of postprandial\r\nnatural history (the subject generally crops up about the same time as\r\nthe after-dinner coffee), and to let the prehistoric toad go on his own\r\ntriumphant way, unheeded.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, nobody ever makes larger allowances for other\r\npeople, in the estimate of their veracity, than the scientific\r\ninquirer. Knowing himself, by painful experience, how extremely\r\ndifficult a matter it is to make perfectly sure you have observed\r\nanything on earth quite correctly, and have eliminated all possible\r\nchances of error, he acquires the fixed habit of doubting about one-half\r\nof whatever his fellow-creatures tell him in ordinary conversation,\r\nwithout for a single moment venturing to suspect them of deliberate\r\nuntruthfulness. Children and servants, if they find that anything they\r\nhave been told is erroneous, immediately jump at the conclusion that the\r\nperson who told them meant deliberately to deceive them; in their own\r\nsimple and categorical fashion they answer plumply, 'That's a lie.' But\r\nthe man of science is only too well acquainted in his own person with\r\nthe exceeding difficulty of ever getting at the exact truth. He has\r\nspent hours of toil, himself, in watching and observing the behaviour of\r\nsome plant, or animal, or gas, or metal; and after repeated experiments,\r\ncarefully designed to exclude all possibility of mistake, so far as he\r\ncan foresee it, he at last believes he has really settled some moot\r\npoint, and triumphantly publishes his final conclusions in a scientific\r\njournal. Ten to one, the very next number of that same journal contains\r\na dozen supercilious letters from a dozen learned and high-salaried\r\nprofessors, each pointing out a dozen distinct and separate precautions\r\nwhich the painstaking observer neglected to take, and any one of which\r\nwould be quite sufficient to vitiate the whole body of his observations.\r\nThere might have been germs in the tube in which he boiled the water\r\n(germs are very fashionable just at present); or some of the germs might\r\nhave survived and rather enjoyed the boiling; or they might have adhered\r\nto the under surface of the cork; or the mixture might have been\r\ntampered with during the experimenter's temporary absence by his son,\r\naged ten years (scientific observers have no right, apparently, to have\r\nsons of ten years old, except perhaps for purposes of psychological\r\nresearch); and so forth, _ad infinitum_. And the worst of it all is that\r\nthe unhappy experimenter is bound himself to admit that every one of the\r\nobjections is perfectly valid, and that he very likely never really saw\r\nwhat with perfect confidence he thought and said he had seen.\r\n\r\nThis being an unbelieving age, then, when even the book of Deuteronomy\r\nis 'critically examined,' let us see how much can really be said for and\r\nagainst our old friend, the toad-in-a-hole; and first let us begin with\r\nthe antecedent probability, or otherwise, of any animal being able to\r\nlive in a more or less torpid condition, without air or food, for any\r\nconsiderable period of time together.\r\n\r\nA certain famous historical desert snail was brought from Egypt to\r\nEngland as a conchological specimen in the year 1846. This particular\r\nmollusk (the only one of his race, probably, who ever attained to\r\nindividual distinction), at the time of his arrival in London, was\r\nreally alive and vigorous; but as the authorities of the British Museum,\r\nto whose tender care he was consigned, were ignorant of this important\r\nfact in his economy, he was gummed, mouth downward, on to a piece of\r\ncardboard, and duly labelled and dated with scientific accuracy, '_Helix\r\ndesertorum_, March 25, 1846.' Being a snail of a retiring and contented\r\ndisposition, however, accustomed to long droughts and corresponding naps\r\nin his native sand-wastes, our mollusk thereupon simply curled himself\r\nup into the topmost recesses of his own whorls, and went placidly to\r\nsleep in perfect contentment for an unlimited period. Every conchologist\r\ntakes it for granted, of course, that the shells which he receives from\r\nforeign parts have had their inhabitants properly boiled and extracted\r\nbefore being exported; for it is only the mere outer shell or skeleton\r\nof the animal that we preserve in our cabinets, leaving the actual flesh\r\nand muscles of the creature himself to wither unobserved upon its\r\nnative shores. At the British Museum the desert snail might have snoozed\r\naway his inglorious existence unsuspected, but for a happy accident\r\nwhich attracted public attention to his remarkable case in a most\r\nextraordinary manner. On March 7, 1850, nearly four years later, it was\r\ncasually observed that the card on which he reposed was slightly\r\ndiscoloured; and this discovery led to the suspicion that perhaps a\r\nliving animal might be temporarily immured within that papery tomb. The\r\nMuseum authorities accordingly ordered our friend a warm bath (who shall\r\nsay hereafter that science is unfeeling!), upon which the grateful\r\nsnail, waking up at the touch of the familiar moisture, put his head\r\ncautiously out of his shell, walked up to the top of the basin, and\r\nbegan to take a cursory survey of British institutions with his four\r\neye-bearing tentacles. So strange a recovery from a long torpid\r\ncondition, only equalled by that of the Seven Sleepers of Ephesus,\r\ndeserved an exceptional amount of scientific recognition. The desert\r\nsnail at once awoke and found himself famous. Nay, he actually sat for\r\nhis portrait to an eminent zoological artist, Mr. Waterhouse; and a\r\nwoodcut from the sketch thus procured, with a history of his life and\r\nadventures, may be found even unto this day in Dr. Woodward's 'Manual of\r\nthe Mollusca,' to witness if I lie.\r\n\r\nI mention this curious instance first, because it is the best\r\nauthenticated case on record (so far as my knowledge goes) of any animal\r\nexisting in a state of suspended animation for any long period of time\r\ntogether. But there are other cases of encysted or immured animals\r\nwhich, though less striking as regards the length of time during which\r\ntorpidity has been observed, are much more closely analogous to the real\r\nor mythical conditions of the toad-in-a-hole. That curious West African\r\nmud-fish, the Lepidosiren (familiar to all readers of evolutionary\r\nliterature as one of the most singular existing links between fish and\r\namphibians), lives among the shallow pools and broads of the Gambia,\r\nwhich are dried up during the greater part of the tropical summer. To\r\nprovide against this annual contingency, the mud-fish retires into the\r\nsoft clay at the bottom of the pools, where it forms itself a sort of\r\nnest, and there hibernates, or rather æstivates, for months together, in\r\na torpid condition. The surrounding mud then hardens into a dry ball;\r\nand these balls are dug out of the soil of the rice-fields by the\r\nnatives, with the fish inside them, by which means many specimens of\r\nlepidosiren have been sent alive to Europe, embedded in their natural\r\ncovering. Here the strange fish is chiefly prized as a zoological\r\ncuriosity for aquariums, because of its possessing gills and lungs\r\ntogether, to fit it for its double existence; but the unsophisticated\r\nWest Africans grub it up on their own account as a delicacy, regardless\r\nof its claims to scientific consideration as the earliest known ancestor\r\nof all existing terrestrial animals. Now, the torpid state of the\r\nmud-fish in his hardened ball of clay closely resembles the real or\r\nsupposed condition of the toad-in-a-hole; but with one important\r\nexception. The mud-fish leaves a small canal or pipe open in his cell at\r\neither end to admit the air for breathing, though he breathes (as I\r\nshall proceed to explain) in a very slight degree during his æstivation;\r\nwhereas every proper toad-in-a-hole ought by all accounts to live\r\nentirely without either feeding or breathing in any way. However, this\r\nis a mere detail; and indeed, if toads-in-a-hole do really exist at all,\r\nwe must in all probability ultimately admit that they breathe to some\r\nextent, though perhaps very slightly, during their long immurement.\r\n\r\nAnd this leads us on to consider what in reality hibernation is.\r\nEverybody knows nowadays, I suppose, that there is a very close analogy\r\nbetween an animal and a steam-engine. Food is the fuel that makes the\r\nanimal engine go; and this food acts almost exactly as coal does in the\r\nartificial machine. But coal alone will not drive an engine; a free\r\ndraught of open air is also required in order to produce combustion.\r\nJust in like manner the food we eat cannot be utilised to drive our\r\nmuscles and other organs unless it is supplied with oxygen from the air\r\nto burn it slowly inside our bodies. This oxygen is taken into the\r\nsystem, in all higher animals, by means of lungs or gills. Now, when we\r\nare working at all hard, we require a great deal of oxygen, as most of\r\nus have familiarly discovered (especially if we are somewhat stout) in\r\nthe act of climbing hills or running to catch a train. But when we are\r\ndoing very little work indeed, as in our sleeping hours, during which\r\nmuscular movement is suspended, and only the general organic life\r\ncontinues, we breathe much more slowly and at longer intervals. However,\r\nthere is this important difference (generally speaking) between an\r\nanimal and a steam-engine. You can let the engine run short of coals and\r\ncome to a dead standstill, without impairing its future possibilities of\r\nsimilar motion; you have only to get fresh coals, after weeks or months\r\nof inaction, and light up a fresh fire, when your engine will\r\nimmediately begin to work again, exactly the same as before. But if an\r\nanimal organism once fairly runs down, either from want of food or any\r\nother cause--in short, if it dies--it very seldom comes to life again.\r\n\r\nI say 'very seldom' on purpose, because there are a few cases among the\r\nextreme lower animals where a water-haunting creature can be taken out\r\nof the water and can be thoroughly dried and desiccated, or even kept\r\nfor an apparently unlimited period wrapped up in paper or on the slide\r\nof a microscope; and yet, the moment a drop of water is placed on top of\r\nit, it begins to move and live again exactly as before. This sort of\r\nthorough-going suspended animation is the kind we ought to expect from\r\nany well-constituted and proper-minded toad-in-a-hole. Whether anything\r\nlike it ever really occurs in the higher ranks of animal life, however,\r\nis a different question; but there can be no doubt that to some slight\r\nextent a body to all intents and purposes quite dead (physically\r\nspeaking) by long immersion in water--a drowned man, for example--may\r\nreally be resuscitated by heat and stimulants, applied immediately,\r\nprovided no part of the working organism has been seriously injured or\r\ndecomposed. Such people may be said to be _pro tem._ functionally,\r\nthough not structurally, dead. The heart has practically ceased to beat,\r\nthe lungs have ceased to breathe, and physical life in the body is\r\ntemporarily extinct. The fire, in short, has gone out. But if only it\r\ncan be lighted again before any serious change in the system takes\r\nplace, all may still go on precisely as of old.\r\n\r\nMany animals, however, find it convenient to assume a state of less\r\ncomplete suspended animation during certain special periods of the year,\r\naccording to the circumstances of their peculiar climate and mode of\r\nlife. Among the very highest animals, the most familiar example of this\r\nsort of semi-torpidity is to be found among the bears and the dormice.\r\nThe common European brown bear is a carnivore by descent, who has become\r\na vegetarian in practice, though whether from conscientious scruples or\r\nmere practical considerations of expediency, does not appear. He feeds\r\nchiefly on roots, berries, fruits, vegetables, and honey, all of which\r\nhe finds it comparatively difficult to procure during winter weather.\r\nAccordingly, as everyone knows, he eats immoderately in the summer\r\nseason, till he has grown fat enough to supply bear's grease to all\r\nChristendom. Then he hunts himself out a hollow tree or rock-shelter,\r\ncurls himself up quietly to sleep, and snores away the whole livelong\r\nwinter. During this period of hibernation, the action of the heart is\r\nreduced to a minimum, and the bear breathes but very slowly. Still, he\r\ndoes breathe, and his heart does beat; and in performing those\r\nindispensable functions, all his store of accumulated fat is gradually\r\nused up, so that he wakes in spring as thin as a lath and as hungry as a\r\nhunter. The machine has been working at very low pressure all the\r\nwinter: but it _has_ been working for all that, and the continuity of\r\nits action has never once for a moment been interrupted. This is the\r\ncentral principle of all hibernation; it consists essentially of a very\r\nlong and profound sleep, during which all muscular motion, except that\r\nof the heart and lungs, is completely suspended, while even these last\r\nare reduced to the very smallest amount compatible with the final\r\nrestoration of full animal activity.\r\n\r\nThus, even among warm-blooded animals like the bears and dormice,\r\nhibernation actually occurs to a very considerable degree; but it is far\r\nmore common and more complete among cold-blooded creatures, whose bodies\r\ndo not need to be kept heated to the same degree, and with whom,\r\naccordingly, hibernation becomes almost a complete torpor, the breathing\r\nand the action of the heart being still further reduced to very nearly\r\nzero. Mollusks in particular, like oysters and mussels, lead very\r\nmonotonous and uneventful lives, only varied as a rule by the welcome\r\nchange of being cut out of their shells and eaten alive; and their\r\npowers of living without food under adverse circumstances are really\r\nvery remarkable. Freshwater snails and mussels, in cold weather, bury\r\nthemselves in the mud of ponds or rivers; and land-snails hide\r\nthemselves in the ground or under moss and leaves. The heart then\r\nceases perceptibly to beat, but respiration continues in a very faint\r\ndegree. The common garden snail closes the mouth of his shell when he\r\nwants to hibernate, with a slimy covering; but he leaves a very small\r\nhole in it somewhere, so as to allow a little air to get in, and keep up\r\nhis breathing to a slight amount. My experience has been, however, that\r\na great many snails go to sleep in this way, and never wake up again.\r\nEither they get frozen to death, or else the respiration falls so low\r\nthat it never picks itself up properly when spring returns. In warm\r\nclimates, it is during the summer that mollusks and other mud-haunting\r\ncreatures go to sleep; and when they get well plastered round with clay,\r\nthey almost approach in tenacity of life the mildest recorded specimens\r\nof the toad-in-a-hole.\r\n\r\nFor example, take the following cases, which I extract, with needful\r\nsimplifications, from Dr. Woodward.\r\n\r\n'In June 1850, a living pond mussel, which had been more than a year out\r\nof water, was sent to Mr. Gray, from Australia. The big pond snails of\r\nthe tropics have been found alive in logs of mahogany imported from\r\nHonduras; and M. Caillaud carried some from Egypt to Paris, packed in\r\nsawdust. Indeed, it isn't easy to ascertain the limit of their\r\nendurance; for Mr. Laidlay, having placed a number in a drawer for this\r\nvery purpose, found them alive after _five years'_ torpidity, although\r\nin the warm climate of Calcutta. The pretty snails called _cyclostomas_,\r\nwhich have a lid to their shells, are well known to survive\r\nimprisonments of many months; but in the ordinary open-mouthed\r\nland-snails such cases are even more remarkable. Several of the enormous\r\ntropical snails often used to decorate cottage mantelpieces, brought by\r\nLieutenant Greaves from Valparaiso, revived after being packed, some for\r\nthirteen, others for twenty months. In 1849, Mr. Pickering received\r\nfrom Mr. Wollaston a basketful of Madeira snails (of twenty or thirty\r\ndifferent kinds), three-fourths of which proved to be alive, after\r\nseveral months' confinement, including a sea voyage. Mr. Wollaston has\r\nhimself recorded the fact that specimens of two Madeira snails survived\r\na fast and imprisonment in pill-boxes of two years and a half duration,\r\nand that large numbers of a small species, brought to England at the\r\nsame time, were _all_ living after being inclosed in a dry bag for a\r\nyear and a half.'\r\n\r\nWhether the snails themselves liked their long deprivation of food and\r\nmoisture we are not informed; their personal tastes and inclinations\r\nwere very little consulted in the matter; but as they and their\r\nancestors for many generations must have been accustomed to similar long\r\nfasts during tropical droughts, in all likelihood they did not much mind\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe real question, then, about the historical toad-in-a-hole narrows\r\nitself down in the end merely to this--how long is it credible that a\r\ncold-blooded creature might sustain life in a torpid or hibernating\r\ncondition, without food, and with a very small quantity of fresh air,\r\nsupplied (let us say) from time to time through an almost imperceptible\r\nfissure? It is well known that reptiles and amphibians are particularly\r\ntenacious of life, and that some turtles in particular will live for\r\nmonths, or even for years, without tasting food. The common Greek\r\ntortoise, hawked on barrows about the streets of London and bought by a\r\nconfiding British public under the mistaken impression that its chief\r\nfare consists of slugs and cockroaches (it is really far more likely to\r\nfeed upon its purchaser's choicest seakale and asparagus), buries itself\r\nin the ground at the first approach of winter, and snoozes away five\r\nmonths of the year in a most comfortable and dignified torpidity. A\r\nsnake at the Zoo has even been known to live eighteen months in a\r\nvoluntary fast, refusing all the most tempting offers of birds and\r\nrabbits, merely out of pique at her forcible confinement in a strange\r\ncage. As this was a lady snake, however, it is possible that she only\r\nwent on living out of feminine obstinacy, so that this case really\r\ncounts for very little.\r\n\r\nToads themselves are well known to possess all the qualities of mind and\r\nbody which go to make up the career of a successful and enduring\r\nanchorite. At the best of times they eat seldom and sparingly, while a\r\nforty days' fast, like Dr. Tanner's, would seem to them but an ordinary\r\nincident in their everyday existence. In the winter they hibernate by\r\nburying themselves in the mud, or by getting down cracks in the ground.\r\nIt is also undoubtedly true that they creep into holes wherever they can\r\nfind one, and that in these holes they lie torpid for a considerable\r\nperiod. On the other hand, there is every reason to believe that they\r\ncannot live for more than a certain fixed and relatively short time\r\nentirely without food or air. Dr. Buckland tried a number of experiments\r\nupon toads in this manner--experiments wholly unnecessary, considering\r\nthe trivial nature of the point at issue--and his conclusion was that no\r\ntoad could get beyond two years without feeding or breathing. There can\r\nbe very little doubt that in this conclusion he was practically correct,\r\nand that the real fine old crusted antediluvian toad-in-a-hole is really\r\na snare and a delusion.\r\n\r\nThat, however, does not wholly settle the question about such toads,\r\nbecause, even though they may not be all that their admirers claim for\r\nthem, they may yet possess a very respectable antiquity of their own,\r\nand may be very far from the category of mere vulgar cheats and\r\nimpostors. Because a toad is not as old as Methuselah, it need not\r\nfollow that he may not be as old as Old Parr; because he does not date\r\nback to the Flood, it need not follow that he cannot remember Queen\r\nElizabeth. There are some toads-in-a-hole, indeed, which, however we may\r\naccount for the origin of their legend, are on the very face of it\r\nutterly incredible. For example, there is the favourite and immensely\r\npopular toad who was extracted from a perfectly closed hole in a marble\r\nmantelpiece. The implication of the legend clearly is that the toad was\r\ncoeval with the marble. But marble is limestone, altered in texture by\r\npressure and heat, till it has assumed a crystalline structure. In other\r\nwords we are asked to believe that that toad lived through an amount of\r\nfiery heat sufficient to burn him up into fine powder, and yet remains\r\nto tell the tale. Such a toad as this obviously deserves no credit. His\r\ndiscoverers may have believed in him themselves, but they will hardly\r\nget other people to do so.\r\n\r\nStill, there are a great many ways in which it is quite conceivable that\r\ntoads might get into holes in rocks or trees so as to give rise to the\r\ncommon stories about them, and might even manage to live there for a\r\nconsiderable time with very small quantities of food or air. It must be\r\nremembered that from the very nature of the conditions the hole can\r\nnever be properly examined and inspected until after it has been split\r\nopen and the toad has been extracted from it. Now, if you split open a\r\ntree or a rock, and find a toad inside it, with a cavity which he\r\nexactly fills, it is extremely difficult to say whether there was or was\r\nnot a fissure before you broke the thing to pieces with your hatchet or\r\npickaxe. A very small fissure indeed would be quite sufficient to\r\naccount for the whole delusion; for if the toad could get a little air\r\nto breathe slowly during his torpid period, and could find a few dead\r\nflies or worms among the water that trickled scantily into his hole, he\r\ncould manage to drag out a peaceful and monotonous existence almost\r\nindefinitely. Here are a few possible cases, any one of which will\r\nquite suffice to give rise to at least as good a toad-in-the-hole as\r\nninety-nine out of a hundred published instances.\r\n\r\nAn adult toad buries himself in the mud by a dry pond, and gets coated\r\nwith a hard solid coat of sun-baked clay. His nodule is broken open with\r\na spade, and the toad himself is found inside, almost exactly filling\r\nthe space within the cavity. He has only been there for a few months at\r\nthe outside; but the clay is as hard as a stone, and to the bucolic mind\r\nlooks as if it might have been there ever since the Deluge. Good blue\r\nlias clay, which dries as solid as limestone, would perform this trick\r\nto perfection; and the toad might easily be relegated accordingly to the\r\nsecondary ages of geology. Observe, however, that the actual toads so\r\nfound are not the geological toads we should naturally expect under such\r\nremarkable circumstances, but the common everyday toads of modern\r\nEngland. This shows a want of accurate scientific knowledge on the part\r\nof the toads which is truly lamentable. A toad who really wished to\r\nqualify himself for the post ought at least to avoid presenting himself\r\nbefore a critical eye in the foolish guise of an embodied anachronism.\r\nHe reminds one of the Roman mother in a popular burlesque, who suspects\r\nher son of smoking, and vehemently declares that she smells tobacco,\r\nbut, after a moment, recollects the historical proprieties, and mutters\r\nto herself, apologetically, 'No, not tobacco; that's not yet invented.'\r\nA would-be silurian or triassic toad ought, in like manner, to remember\r\nthat in the ages to whose honours he aspires his own amphibian kind was\r\nnot yet developed. He ought rather to come out in the character of a\r\nceratodus or a labyrinthodon.\r\n\r\nAgain, another adult toad crawls into the hollow of a tree, and there\r\nhibernates. The bark partially closes over the slit by which he entered,\r\nbut leaves a little crack by which air can enter freely. The grubs in\r\nthe bark and other insects supply him from time to time with a frugal\r\nrepast. There is no good reason why, under such circumstances, a placid\r\nand contented toad might not manage to prolong his existence for several\r\nconsecutive seasons.\r\n\r\nOnce more, the spawn of toads is very small, as regards the size of the\r\nindividual eggs, compared with the size of the full-grown animal.\r\nNothing would be easier than for a piece of spawn or a tiny tadpole to\r\nbe washed into some hole in a mine or cave, where there was sufficient\r\nwater for its developement, and where the trickling drops brought down\r\nminute objects of food, enough to keep up its simple existence. A toad\r\nbrought up under such peculiar circumstances might pass almost its\r\nentire life in a state of torpidity, and yet might grow and thrive in\r\nits own sleepy vegetative fashion.\r\n\r\nIn short, while it would be difficult in any given case to prove to a\r\ncertainty either that the particular toad-in-a-hole had or had not\r\naccess to air and food, the ordinary conditions of toad life are exactly\r\nthose under which the delusive appearance of venerable antiquity would\r\nbe almost certain frequently to arise. The toad is a nocturnal animal;\r\nit lives through the daytime in dark and damp places; it shows a decided\r\nliking for crannies and crevices; it is wonderfully tenacious of life;\r\nit possesses the power of hibernation; it can live on extremely small\r\nquantities of food for very long periods of time together; it buries\r\nitself in mud or clay; it passes the early part of its life as a\r\nwater-haunting tadpole; and last, not least, it can swell out its body\r\nto nearly double its natural size by inflating itself, which fully\r\naccounts for the stories of toads being taken out of holes every bit as\r\nbig as themselves. Considering all these things, it would be wonderful\r\nindeed if toads were not often found in places and conditions which\r\nwould naturally give rise to the familiar myth. Throw in a little\r\nallowance for human credulity, human exaggeration, and human love of the\r\nmarvellous, and you have all the elements of a very excellent\r\ntoad-in-the-hole in the highest ideal perfection.\r\n\r\nAt the same time I think it quite possible that some toads, under\r\nnatural circumstances, do really remain in a torpid or semi-torpid\r\ncondition for a period far exceeding the twenty-four months allowed as\r\nthe maximum in Dr. Buckland's unpleasant experiments. If the amount of\r\nair supplied through a crack or through the texture of the stone were\r\nexactly sufficient for keeping the animal alive in the very slightest\r\nfashion--the engine working at the lowest possible pressure, short of\r\nabsolute cessation--I see no reason on earth why a toad might not remain\r\ndormant, in a moist place, with perhaps a very occasional worm or grub\r\nfor breakfast, for at least as long a time as the desert snail slept\r\ncomfortably in the British Museum. Altogether, while it is impossible to\r\nbelieve the stories about toads that have been buried in a mine for\r\nwhole centuries, and still more impossible to believe in their being\r\ndisentombed from marble mantelpieces or very ancient geological\r\nformations, it is quite conceivable that some toads-in-a-hole may really\r\nbe far from mere vulgar impostors, and may have passed the traditional\r\nseven years of the Indian philosophers in solitary meditation on the\r\nsyllable Om, or on the equally significant Ko-ax, Ko-ax of the\r\nirreverent Attic dramatist. \"Certainly not a centenarian, but perhaps a\r\ngood seven-year sleeper for all that,\" is the final verdict which the\r\ncourt is disposed to return, after due consideration of all the\r\nprobabilities _in re_ the toad-in-a-hole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA FOSSIL CONTINENT\r\n\r\n\r\nIf an intelligent Australian colonist were suddenly to be translated\r\nbackward from Collins Street, Melbourne, into the flourishing woods of\r\nthe secondary geological period--say about the precise moment of time\r\nwhen the English chalk downs were slowly accumulating, speck by speck,\r\non the silent floor of some long-forgotten Mediterranean--the\r\nintelligent colonist would look around him with a sweet smile of\r\ncheerful recognition, and say to himself in some surprise, 'Why, this is\r\njust like Australia.' The animals, the trees, the plants, the insects,\r\nwould all more or less vividly remind him of those he had left behind\r\nhim in his happy home of the southern seas and the nineteenth century.\r\nThe sun would have moved back on the dial of ages for a few million\r\nsummers or so, indefinitely (in geology we refuse to be bound by dates),\r\nand would have landed him at last, to his immense astonishment, pretty\r\nmuch at the exact point whence he first started.\r\n\r\nIn other words, with a few needful qualifications, to be made hereafter,\r\nAustralia is, so to speak, a fossil continent, a country still in its\r\nsecondary age, a surviving fragment of the primitive world of the chalk\r\nperiod or earlier ages. Isolated from all the remainder of the earth\r\nabout the beginning of the tertiary epoch, long before the mammoth and\r\nthe mastodon had yet dreamt of appearing upon the stage of existence,\r\nlong before the first shadowy ancestor of the horse had turned tail on\r\nnature's rough draft of the still undeveloped and unspecialised lion,\r\nlong before the extinct dinotheriums and gigantic Irish elks and\r\ncolossal giraffes of late tertiary times had even begun to run their\r\nrace on the broad plains of Europe and America, the Australian continent\r\nfound itself at an early period of its development cut off entirely from\r\nall social intercourse with the remainder of our planet, and turned upon\r\nitself, like the German philosopher, to evolve its own plants and\r\nanimals out of its own inner consciousness. The natural consequence was\r\nthat progress in Australia has been absurdly slow, and that the country\r\nas a whole has fallen most woefully behind the times in all matters\r\npertaining to the existence of life upon its surface. Everybody knows\r\nthat Australia as a whole is a very peculiar and original continent; its\r\npeculiarity, however, consists, at bottom, for the most part in the fact\r\nthat it still remains at very nearly the same early point of development\r\nwhich Europe had attained a couple of million years ago or thereabouts.\r\n\"Advance, Australia,\" says the national motto; and, indeed, it is quite\r\ntime nowadays that Australia should advance; for, so far, she has been\r\nleft out of the running for some four mundane ages or so at a rough\r\ncomputation.\r\n\r\nExample, says the wisdom of our ancestors, is better than precept; so\r\nperhaps, if I take a single example to start with, I shall make the\r\nprinciple I wish to illustrate a trifle clearer to the European\r\ncomprehension. In Australia, when Cook or Van Diemen first visited it,\r\nthere were no horses, cows, or sheep; no rabbits, weasels, or cats; no\r\nindigenous quadrupeds of any sort except the pouched mammals or\r\nmarsupials, familiarly typified to every one of us by the mamma kangaroo\r\nin Regent's Park, who carries the baby kangaroos about with her, neatly\r\ndeposited in the sac or pouch which nature has provided for them instead\r\nof a cradle. To this rough generalisation, to be sure, two special\r\nexceptions must needs be made; namely, the noble Australian black-fellow\r\nhimself, and the dingo or wild dog whose ancestors no doubt came to the\r\ncountry in the same ship with him, as the brown rat came to England with\r\nGeorge I. of blessed memory. But of these two solitary representatives\r\nof the later and higher Asiatic fauna 'more anon'; for the present we\r\nmay regard it as approximately true that aboriginal and unsophisticated\r\nAustralia in the lump was wholly given over, on its first discovery, to\r\nkangaroos, phalangers, dasyures, wombats, and other quaint marsupial\r\nanimals, with names as strange and clumsy as their forms.\r\n\r\nNow, who and what are the marsupials as a family, viewed in the dry\r\nlight of modern science? Well, they are simply one of the very oldest\r\nmammalian families, and therefore, I need hardly say, in the levelling\r\nand topsy-turvy view of evolutionary biology, the least entitled to\r\nconsideration or respect from rational observers. For of course in the\r\nkingdom of science the last shall be first, and the first last; it is\r\nthe oldest families that are accounted the worst, while the best\r\nfamilies mean always the newest. Now, the earliest mammals to appear on\r\nearth were creatures of distinctly marsupial type. As long ago as the\r\ntime when the red marl of Devonshire and the blue lias of Lyme Regis\r\nwere laid down on the bed of the muddy sea that once covered the surface\r\nof Dorset and the English Channel, a little creature like the kangaroo\r\nrats of Southern Australia lived among the plains of what is now the\r\nsouth of England. In the ages succeeding the deposition of the red marl\r\nEurope seems to have been broken up into an archipelago of coral reefs\r\nand atolls; and the islands of this ancient oolitic ocean were tenanted\r\nby numbers of tiny ancestral marsupials, some of which approached in\r\nappearance the pouched ant-eaters of Western Australia, while others\r\nresembled rather the phalangers and wombats, or turned into excellent\r\nimitation carnivores, like our modern friend the Tasmanian devil. Up to\r\nthe end of the time when the chalk deposits of Surrey, Kent, and Sussex\r\nwere laid down, indeed, there is no evidence of the existence anywhere\r\nin the world of any mammals differing in type from those which now\r\ninhabit Australia. In other words, so far as regards mammalian life, the\r\nwhole of the world had then already reached pretty nearly the same point\r\nof evolution that poor Australia still sticks at.\r\n\r\nAbout the beginning of the tertiary period, however, just after the\r\nchalk was all deposited, and just before the comparatively modern clays\r\nand sandstones of the London basin began to be laid down, an arm of the\r\nsea broke up the connection which once subsisted between Australia and\r\nthe rest of the world, probably by a land bridge, _viâ_ Java, Sumatra,\r\nthe Malay peninsula, and Asia generally. 'But how do you know,' asks the\r\ncandid inquirer, 'that such a connection ever existed at all?' Simply\r\nthus, most laudable investigator--because there are large land mammals\r\nin Australia. Now, large land mammals do not swim across a broad ocean.\r\nThere are none in New Zealand, none in the Azores, none in Fiji, none in\r\nTahiti, none in Madeira, none in Teneriffe--none, in short, in any\r\noceanic island which never at any time formed part of a great continent.\r\nHow could there be, indeed? The mammals must necessarily have got there\r\nfrom somewhere; and whenever we find islands like Britain, or Japan, or\r\nNewfoundland, or Sicily, possessing large and abundant indigenous\r\nquadrupeds, of the same general type as adjacent continents, we see at\r\nonce that the island must formerly have been a mere peninsula, like\r\nItaly or Nova Scotia at the present day. The very fact that Australia\r\nincloses a large group of biggish quadrupeds, whose congeners once\r\ninhabited Europe and America, suffices in itself to prove beyond\r\nquestion that uninterrupted land communication must once have existed\r\nbetween Australia and those distant continents.\r\n\r\nIn fact, to this day a belt of very deep sea, known as Wallace's Line,\r\nfrom the great naturalist who first pointed out its far-reaching\r\nzoological importance, separates what is called by science 'the\r\nAustralian province' on the southwest from 'the Indo-Malayan province'\r\nto the north and east of it. This belt of deep sea divides off sharply\r\nthe plants and animals of the Australian type from those of the common\r\nIndian and Burmese pattern. South of Wallace's Line we now find several\r\nislands, big and small, including New Guinea, Australia, Tasmania, the\r\nMoluccas, Celebes, Timor, Amboyna, and Banda. All these lands, whose\r\nprecise geographical position on the map must of course be readily\r\nremembered, in this age of school boards and universal examination, by\r\nevery pupil-teacher and every Girton girl, are now divided by minor\r\nstraits of much shallower water; but they all stand on a great submarine\r\nbank, and obviously formed at one time parts of the same wide Australian\r\ncontinent, because animals of the Australian type are still found in\r\nevery one of them. No Indian or Malayan animal, however, of the larger\r\nsort (other than birds) is to be discovered anywhere south of Wallace's\r\nLine. That narrow belt of deep sea, in short, forms an ocean barrier\r\nwhich has subsisted there without alteration ever since the end of the\r\nsecondary period. From that time to this, as the evidence shows us,\r\nthere has never been any direct land communication between Australia and\r\nany part of the outer world beyond that narrow line of division.\r\n\r\nSome years ago, in fact, a clever hoax took the world by surprise for a\r\nmoment, under the audacious title of 'Captain Lawson's Adventures in New\r\nGuinea.' The gallant captain, or his unknown creator in some London\r\nlodging, pretended to have explored the Papuan jungles, and there to\r\nhave met with marvellous escapes from terrible beasts of the common\r\ntropical Asiatic pattern--rhinoceroses, tigers, monkeys, and leopards.\r\nEverybody believed the new Munchausen at first, except the zoologists.\r\nThose canny folks saw through the wicked hoax on the very first blush of\r\nit. If there were rhinoceroses in Papua, they must have got there by an\r\noverland route. If there had ever been a land connection between New\r\nGuinea and the Malay region, then, since Australian animals range into\r\nNew Guinea, Malayan animals would have ranged into Australia, and we\r\nshould find Victoria and New South Wales at the present day peopled by\r\ntapirs, orang-outangs, wild boars, deer, elephants, and squirrels, like\r\nthose which now people Borneo, instead of, or side by side with, the\r\nkangaroos, wombats, and other marsupials, which, as we know, actually\r\nform the sole indigenous mammalian population of Greater Britain beneath\r\nthe Southern Cross. Of course, in the end, the mysterious and tremendous\r\nCaptain Lawson proved to be a myth, an airy nothing upon whom\r\nimagination had bestowed a local habitation (in New Guinea) and a name\r\n(not to be found in the Army List). Wallace's Line was saved from\r\nreproach, and the intrusive rhinoceros was banished without appeal from\r\nthe soil of Papua.\r\n\r\nAfter the deep belt of open sea was thus established between the bigger\r\nAustralian continent and the Malayan region, however, the mammals of the\r\ngreat mainlands continued to develop on their own account, in accordance\r\nwith the strictest Darwinian principles, among the wider plains of their\r\nown habitats. The competition there was fiercer and more general; the\r\nstruggle for life was bloodier and more arduous. Hence, while the\r\nold-fashioned marsupials continued to survive and to evolve slowly along\r\ntheir own lines in their own restricted southern world, their\r\ncollateral descendants in Europe and Asia and America or elsewhere went\r\non progressing into far higher, stronger, and better adapted forms--the\r\ngreat central mammalian fauna. In place of the petty phalangers and\r\npouched ant-eaters of the oolitic period, our tertiary strata in the\r\nlarger continents show us a rapid and extraordinary development of the\r\nmammalian race into monstrous creatures, some of them now quite extinct,\r\nand some still holding their own undisturbed in India, Africa, and the\r\nAmerican prairies. The palæotherium and the deinoceras, the mastodon and\r\nthe mammoth, the huge giraffes and antelopes of sunnier times, succeed\r\nto the ancestral kangaroos and wombats of the secondary strata. Slowly\r\nthe horses grow more horse-like, the shadowy camel begins to camelise\r\nhimself, the buffaloes acquire the rudiments of horns, the deer branch\r\nout by tentative steps into still more complicated and more complicated\r\nantlers. Side by side with this wonderful outgrowth of the mammalian\r\ntype, in the first plasticity of its vigorous youth, the older\r\nmarsupials die away one by one in the geological record before the faces\r\nof their more successful competitors; the new carnivores devour them\r\nwholesale, the new ruminants eat up their pastures, the new rodents\r\noutwit them in the modernised forests. At last the pouched creatures all\r\ndisappear utterly from all the world, save only Australia, with the\r\nsolitary exception of a single advanced marsupial family, the familiar\r\nopossum of plantation melodies. And the history of the opossum himself\r\nis so very singular that it almost deserves to receive the polite\r\nattention of a separate paragraph for its own proper elucidation.\r\n\r\nFor the opossums form the only members of the marsupial class now living\r\noutside Australia; and yet, what is at least equally remarkable, none of\r\nthe opossums are found _per contra_ in Australia itself. They are, in\r\nfact, the highest and best product of the old dying marsupial stock,\r\nspecially evolved in the great continents through the fierce competition\r\nof the higher mammals then being developed on every side of them.\r\nTherefore, being later in point of time than the separation, they could\r\nno more get over to Australia than the elephants and tigers and\r\nrhinoceroses could. They are the last bid for life of the marsupial race\r\nin its hopeless struggle against its more developed mammalian cousins.\r\nIn Europe and Asia the opossums lived on lustily, in spite of\r\ncompetition, during the whole of the Eocene period, side by side with\r\nhog-like creatures not yet perfectly piggish, with nondescript animals,\r\nhalf horse half tapir, and with hornless forms of deer and antelopes,\r\nunprovided, so far, with the first rudiment of budding antlers. But in\r\nthe succeeding age they seem to disappear from the eastern continent,\r\nthough in the western, thanks to their hand-like feet, opposable thumb,\r\nand tree-haunting life, they still drag out a precarious existence in\r\nmany forms from Virginia to Chili, and from Brazil to California. It is\r\nworth while to notice, too, that whereas the kangaroos and other\r\nAustralian marsupials are proverbially the very stupidest of mammals,\r\nthe opossums, on the contrary, are well known to those accurate\r\nobservers of animal psychology, the plantation negroes, to be the very\r\ncleverest, cunningest, and slyest of American quadrupeds. In the fierce\r\nstruggle for life of the crowded American lowlands, the opossum was\r\nabsolutely forced to acquire a certain amount of Yankee smartness, or\r\nelse to be improved off the face of the earth by the keen competition of\r\nthe pouchless mammals.\r\n\r\nUp to the day, then, when Captain Cook and Sir Joseph Banks, landing for\r\nthe first time on the coast of New South Wales, saw an animal with short\r\nfront limbs, huge hind legs, a monstrous tail, and a curious habit of\r\nhopping along the ground (called by the natives a kangaroo), the\r\nopossums of America were the only pouched mammals known to the European\r\nworld in any part of the explored continents. Australia, severed from\r\nall the rest of the earth--_penitus toto orbe divisa_--ever since the\r\nend of the secondary period, remained as yet, so to speak, in the\r\nsecondary age so far as its larger life-elements were concerned, and\r\npresented to the first comers a certain vague and indefinite picture of\r\nwhat 'the world before the flood' must have looked like. Only it was a\r\nvery remote flood; an antediluvian age separated from our own not by\r\nthousands, but by millions, of seasons.\r\n\r\nTo this rough approximate statement, however, sundry needful\r\nqualifications must be made at the very outset. No statement is ever\r\nquite correct until you have contradicted in minute detail about\r\ntwo-thirds of it.\r\n\r\nIn the first place there are a good many modern elements in the\r\nindigenous population of Australia; but then they are elements of the\r\nstray and casual sort one always finds even in remote oceanic islands.\r\nThey are waifs wafted by accident from other places. For example, the\r\nflora is by no means exclusively an ancient flora, for a considerable\r\nnumber of seeds and fruits and spores of ferns always get blown by the\r\nwind, or washed by the sea, or carried on the feet or feathers of birds,\r\nfrom one part of the world to another. In all these various ways, no\r\ndoubt, modern plants from the Asiatic region have invaded Australia at\r\ndifferent times, and altered to some extent the character and aspect of\r\nits original native vegetation. Nevertheless, even in the matter of its\r\nplants and trees, Australia must still be considered a very\r\nold-fashioned and stick-in-the-mud continent. The strange\r\npuzzle-monkeys, the quaint-jointed casuarinas (like horsetails grown\r\ninto big willows), and the park-like forests of blue gum-trees, with\r\ntheir smooth stems robbed of their outer bark, impart a marvellously\r\nantiquated and unfamiliar tone to the general appearance of Australian\r\nwoodland. All these types belong by birth to classes long since extinct\r\nin the larger continents. The scrub shows no turfy greensward; grasses,\r\nwhich elsewhere carpet the ground, were almost unknown till introduced\r\nfrom Europe; in the wild lands, bushes, and undershrubs of ancient\r\naspect cover the soil, remarkable for their stiff, dry, wiry foliage,\r\ntheir vertically instead of horizontally flattened leaves, and their\r\ngeneral dead blue-green or glaucous colour. Altogether, the vegetation\r\nitself, though it contains a few more modern forms than the animal\r\nworld, is still essentially antique in type, a strange survival from the\r\nforgotten flora of the chalk age, the oolite, and even the lias.\r\n\r\nAgain, to winged animals, such as birds and bats and flying insects, the\r\nocean forms far less of a barrier than it does to quadrupeds, to\r\nreptiles, and to fresh-water fishes. Hence Australia has, to some\r\nextent, been invaded by later types of birds and other flying creatures,\r\nwho live on there side by side with the ancient animals of the secondary\r\npattern. Warblers, thrushes, flycatchers, shrikes, and crows must all be\r\ncomparatively recent immigrants from the Asiatic mainland. Even in this\r\nrespect, however, the Australian life-region still bears an antiquated\r\nand undeveloped aspect. Nowhere else in the world do we find those very\r\noldest types of birds represented by the cassowaries, the emus, and the\r\nmooruk of New Britain. The extreme term in this exceedingly ancient set\r\nof creature is given us by the wingless bird, the apteryx or kiwi of New\r\nZealand, whose feathers nearly resemble hair, and whose grotesque\r\nappearance makes it as much a wonder in its own class as the\r\npuzzle-monkey and the casuarina are among forest trees. No feathered\r\ncreatures so closely approach the lizard-tailed birds of the oolite or\r\nthe toothed birds of the cretaceous period as do these Australian and\r\nNew Zealand emus and apteryxes. Again, while many characteristic\r\nOriental families are quite absent, like the vultures, woodpeckers,\r\npheasants and bulbuls, the Australian region has many other fairly\r\nancient birds, found nowhere else on the surface of our modern planet.\r\nSuch are the so-called brush turkeys and mound builders, the only\r\nfeathered things that never sit upon their own eggs, but allow them to\r\nbe hatched, after the fashion of reptiles, by the heat of the sand or of\r\nfermenting vegetable matter. The piping crows, the honey-suckers, the\r\nlyre-birds, and the more-porks are all peculiar to the Australian\r\nregion. So are the wonderful and æsthetic bower-birds. Brush-tongued\r\nlories, black cockatoos, and gorgeously coloured pigeons, though\r\nsomewhat less antique, perhaps, in type, give a special character to the\r\nbird-life of the country. And in New Guinea, an isolated bit of the same\r\nold continent, the birds of paradise, found nowhere else in the whole\r\nworld, seem to recall some forgotten Eden of the remote past, some\r\ngolden age of Saturnian splendour. Poetry apart, into which I have\r\ndropped for a moment like Mr. Silas Wegg, the birds of paradise are, in\r\nfact, gorgeously dressed crows, specially adapted to forest life in a\r\nrich fruit-bearing tropical country, where food is abundant and enemies\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\nLast of all, a certain small number of modern mammals have passed over\r\nto Australia at various times by pure chance. They fall into two\r\nclasses--the rats and mice, who doubtless got transported across on\r\nfloating logs or balks of timber; and the human importations, including\r\nthe dog, who came, perhaps on their owners' canoes, perhaps on the wreck\r\nand _débris_ of inundations. Yet even in these cases again, Australia\r\nstill maintains its proud pre-eminence as the most antiquated and\r\nunprogressive of continents. For the Australian black-fellow must have\r\ngot there a very long time ago indeed; he belongs to an extremely\r\nancient human type, and strikingly recalls in his jaws and skull the\r\nNeanderthal savage and other early prehistoric races; while the\r\nwoolly-headed Tasmanian, a member of a totally distinct human family,\r\nand perhaps the very lowest sample of humanity that has survived to\r\nmodern times, must have crossed over to Tasmania even earlier still, his\r\nbrethren on the mainland having no doubt been exterminated later on when\r\nthe stone-age Australian black-fellows first got cast ashore upon the\r\ncontinent inhabited by the yet more barbaric and helpless negrito race.\r\nAs for the dingo, or Australian wild dog, only half domesticated by the\r\nsavage natives, he represents a low ancestral dog type, half wolf and\r\nhalf jackal, incapable of the higher canine traits, and with a\r\nsuspicious, ferocious, glaring eye that betrays at once his\r\nuncivilisable tendencies.\r\n\r\nOmitting these later importations, however--the modern plants, birds,\r\nand human beings--it may be fairly said that Australia is still in its\r\nsecondary stage, while the rest of the world has reached the tertiary\r\nand quaternary periods. Here again, however, a deduction must be made,\r\nin order to attain the necessary accuracy. Even in Australia the world\r\nnever stands still. Though the Australian animals are still at bottom\r\nthe European and Asiatic animals of the secondary age, they are those\r\nanimals with a difference. They have undergone an evolution of their\r\nown. It has not been the evolution of the great continents; but it has\r\nbeen evolution all the same; slower, more local, narrower, more\r\nrestricted, yet evolution in the truest sense. One might compare the\r\ndifference to the difference between the civilisation of Europe and the\r\ncivilisation of Mexico or Peru. The Mexicans, when Cortez blotted out\r\ntheir indigenous culture, were still, to be sure, in their stone age;\r\nbut it was a very different stone age from that of the cave-dwellers or\r\nmound builders in Britain. Even so, though Australia is still\r\nzoologically in the secondary period, it is a secondary period a good\r\ndeal altered and adapted in detail to meet the wants of special\r\nsituations.\r\n\r\nThe oldest types of animals in Australia are the ornithorhynchus and the\r\nechidna, the 'beast with a bill,' and the 'porcupine ant-eater' of\r\npopular natural history. These curious creatures, genuine living\r\nfossils, occupy in some respects an intermediate place between the\r\nmammals on the one hand and the birds and lizards on the other. The\r\nechidna has no teeth, and a very bird-like skull and body; the\r\nornithorhynchus has a bill like a duck's, webbed feet, and a great many\r\nquaint anatomical peculiarities which closely ally it to the birds and\r\nreptiles. Both, in fact, are early arrested stages in the development of\r\nmammals from the old common vertebrate ancestor; and they could only\r\nhave struggled on to our own day in a continent free from the severe\r\ncompetition of the higher types which have since been evolved in Europe\r\nand Asia. Even in Australia itself the ornithorhynchus and echidna have\r\nhad to put up perforce with the lower places in the hierarchy of nature.\r\nThe first is a burrowing and aquatic creature, specialised in a thousand\r\nminute ways for his amphibious life and queer subterranean habits; the\r\nsecond is a spiny hedgehog-like nocturnal prowler, who buries himself in\r\nthe earth during the day, and lives by night on insects which he licks\r\nup greedily with his long ribbon-like tongue. Apart from the\r\nspecialisations brought about by their necessary adaptation to a\r\nparticular niche in the economy of life, these two quaint and very\r\nancient animals probably preserve for us in their general structure the\r\nfeatures of an extremely early descendant of the common ancestor from\r\nwhom mammals, birds, and reptiles alike are originally derived.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary Australian pouched mammals belong to far less ancient types\r\nthan ornithorhynchus and echidna, but they too are very old in\r\nstructure, though they have undergone an extraordinary separate\r\nevolution to fit them for the most diverse positions in life. Almost\r\nevery main form of higher mammal (except the biggest ones) has, as it\r\nwere, its analogue or representative among the marsupial fauna of the\r\nAustralasian region fitted to fill the same niche in nature. For\r\ninstance, in the blue gum forests of New South Wales a small animal\r\ninhabits the trees, in form and aspect exactly like a flying squirrel.\r\nNobody who was not a structural and anatomical naturalist would ever for\r\na moment dream of doubting its close affinity to the flying squirrels of\r\nthe American woodlands. It has just the same general outline, just the\r\nsame bushy tail, just the same rough arrangement of colours, and just\r\nthe same expanded parachute-like membrane stretching between the fore\r\nand hind limbs. Why should this be so? Clearly because both animals have\r\nindependently adapted themselves to the same mode of life under the same\r\ngeneral circumstances. Natural selection, acting upon unlike original\r\ntypes, but in like conditions, has produced in the end very similar\r\nresults in both cases. Still, when we come to examine the more intimate\r\nunderlying structure of the two animals, a profound fundamental\r\ndifference at once exhibits itself. The one is distinctly a true\r\nsquirrel, a rodent of the rodents, externally adapted to an arboreal\r\nexistence; the other is equally a true phalanger, a marsupial of the\r\nmarsupials, which has independently undergone on his own account very\r\nmuch the same adaptation, for very much the same reasons. Just so a\r\ndolphin looks externally very like a fish, in head and tail and form and\r\nmovement; its flippers closely resemble fins; and nothing about it\r\nseems to differ very markedly from the outer aspect of a shark or a\r\ncodfish. But in reality it has no gills and no swim-bladder; it lays no\r\neggs; it does not own one truly fish-like organ. It breathes air, it\r\npossesses lungs, it has warm blood, it suckles its young; in heart and\r\nbrain and nerves and organisation it is a thorough-going mammal, with an\r\nacquired resemblance to the fishy form, due entirely to mere similarity\r\nin place of residence.\r\n\r\nRunning hastily through the chief marsupial developments, one may say\r\nthat the wombats are pouched animals who take the place of rabbits or\r\nmarmots in Europe, and resemble them both in burrowing habits and more\r\nor less in shape, which closely approaches the familiar and ungraceful\r\nguinea-pig outline. The vulpine phalanger does duty for a fox; the fat\r\nand sleepy little dormouse phalanger takes the place of a European\r\ndormouse. Both are so ridiculously like the analogous animals of the\r\nlarger continents that the colonists always call them, in perfect good\r\nfaith, by the familiar names of the old-country creatures. The koala\r\nposes as a small bear; the cuscus answers to the racoons of America. The\r\npouched badgers explain themselves at once by their very name, like the\r\nPlyants, the Pinchwifes, the Brainsicks, and the Carelesses of the\r\nRestoration comedy. The 'native rabbit' of Swan River is a rabbit-like\r\nbandicoot; the pouched ant-eater similarly takes the place of the true\r\nant-eaters of other continents. By way of carnivores, the Tasmanian\r\ndevil is a fierce and savage marsupial analogue of the American\r\nwolverine; a smaller species of the same type usurps the name and place\r\nof the marten; and the dog-headed Thylacinus is in form and figure\r\nprecisely like a wolf or a jackal. The pouched weasels are very\r\nweasel-like; the kangaroo rats and kangaroo mice run the true rats and\r\nmice a close race in every particular. And it is worth notice, in this\r\nconnection, that the one marsupial family which could compete with\r\nhigher American life, the opossums, are really, so to speak, the monkey\r\ndevelopment of the marsupial race. They have opposable thumbs, which\r\nmake their feet almost into hands; they have prehensile tails, by which\r\nthey hang from branches in true monkey fashion; they lead an arboreal\r\nomnivorous existence; they feed off fruits, birds' eggs, insects, and\r\nroots; and altogether they are just active, cunning, intelligent,\r\ntree-haunting marsupial spider-monkeys.\r\n\r\nAustralia has also one still more ancient denizen than any of these, a\r\nliving fossil of the very oldest sort, a creature of wholly immemorial\r\nand primitive antiquity. The story of its discovery teems with the\r\nstrangest romance of natural history. To those who could appreciate the\r\nfacts of the case it was just as curious and just as interesting as\r\nthough we were now to discover somewhere in an unknown island or an\r\nAfrican oasis some surviving mammoth, some belated megatherium, or some\r\ngigantic and misshapen liassic saurian. Imagine the extinct animals of\r\nthe Crystal Palace grounds suddenly appearing to our dazzled eyes in a\r\ntropical ramble, and you can faintly conceive the delight and\r\nastonishment of naturalists at large when the barramunda first 'swam\r\ninto their ken' in the rivers of Queensland. To be sure, in size and\r\nshape this 'extinct fish,' still living and grunting quietly in our\r\nmidst, is comparatively insignificant beside the 'dragons of the prime'\r\nimmortalised in a famous stanza by Tennyson: but, to the true\r\nenthusiast, size is nothing; and the barramunda is just as much a marvel\r\nand a monster as the Atlantosaurus himself would have been if he had\r\nsuddenly walked upon the stage of time, dragging fifty feet of\r\nlizard-like tail in a train behind him. And this is the plain story of\r\nthat marvellous discovery of a 'missing link' in our own pedigree.\r\n\r\nIn the oldest secondary rocks of Britain and elsewhere there occur in\r\nabundance the teeth of a genus of ganoid fishes known as the Ceratodi.\r\n(I apologise for ganoid, though it is not a swear-word). These teeth\r\nreappear from time to time in several subsequent formations, but at last\r\nslowly die out altogether; and of course all naturalists naturally\r\nconcluded that the creature to which they belonged had died out also,\r\nand was long since numbered with the dodo and the mastodon. The idea\r\nthat a Ceratodus could still be living, far less that it formed an\r\nimportant link in the development of all the higher animals, could never\r\nfor a moment have occurred to anybody. As well expect to find a\r\npalæolithic man quietly chipping flints on a Pacific atoll, or to\r\ndiscover the ancestor of all horses on the isolated and crag-encircled\r\nsummit of Roraima, as to unearth a real live Ceratodus from a modern\r\nestuary. In 1870, however, Mr. Krefft took away the breath of scientific\r\nEurope by informing it that he had found the extinct ganoid swimming\r\nabout as large as life, and six feet long, without the faintest\r\nconsciousness of its own scientific importance, in a river in Queensland\r\nat the present day. The unsophisticated aborigines knew it as\r\nbarramunda; the almost equally ignorant white settlers called it with\r\nirreverent and unfilial contempt the flat-head. On further examination,\r\nhowever, the despised barramunda proved to be a connecting link of\r\nprimary rank between the oldest surviving group of fishes and the lowest\r\nair-breathing animals like the frogs and salamanders. Though a true\r\nfish, it leaves its native streams at night, and sets out on a foraging\r\nexpedition after vegetable food in the neighbouring woodlands. There it\r\nbrowses on myrtle leaves and grasses, and otherwise behaves itself in a\r\nmanner wholly unbecoming its piscine antecedents and aquatic education.\r\nTo fit it for this strange amphibious life, the barramunda has both\r\nlungs and gills; it can breathe either air or water at will, or, if it\r\nchooses, the two together. Though covered with scales, and most\r\nfish-like in outline, it presents points of anatomical resemblance both\r\nto salamanders and lizards; and, as a connecting bond between the North\r\nAmerican mud-fish on the one hand and the wonderful lepidosiren on the\r\nother, it forms a true member of the long series by which the higher\r\nanimals generally trace their descent from a remote race of marine\r\nancestors. It is very interesting, therefore, to find that this living\r\nfossil link between fish and reptiles should have survived only in the\r\nfossil continent, Australia. Everywhere else it has long since been\r\nbeaten out of the field by its own more developed amphibian descendants;\r\nin Australia alone it still drags on a lonely existence as the last\r\nrelic of an otherwise long-forgotten and extinct family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA VERY OLD MASTER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe work of art which lies before me is old, unquestionably old; a good\r\ndeal older, in fact, than Archbishop Ussher (who invented all out of his\r\nown archiepiscopal head the date commonly assigned for the creation of\r\nthe world) would by any means have been ready to admit. It is a\r\nbas-relief by an old master, considerably more antique in origin than\r\nthe most archaic gem or intaglio in the Museo Borbonico at Naples, the\r\nmildly decorous Louvre in Paris, or the eminently respectable British\r\nMuseum, which is the glory of our own smoky London in the spectacled\r\neyes of German professors, all put together. When Assyrian sculptors\r\ncarved in fresh white alabaster the flowing curls of Sennacherib's hair,\r\njust like a modern coachman's wig, this work of primæval art was already\r\nhoary with the rime of ages. When Memphian artists were busy in the\r\nmorning twilight of time with the towering coiffure of Ramses or\r\nSesostris, this far more ancient relic of plastic handicraft was lying,\r\nalready fossil and forgotten, beneath the concreted floor of a cave in\r\nthe Dordogne. If we were to divide the period for which we possess\r\nauthentic records of man's abode upon this oblate spheroid into ten\r\nepochs--an epoch being a good high-sounding word which doesn't commit\r\none to any definite chronology in particular--then it is probable that\r\nall known art, from the Egyptian onward, would fall into the tenth of\r\nthe epochs thus loosely demarcated, while my old French bas-relief\r\nwould fall into the first. To put the date quite succinctly, I should\r\nsay it was most likely about 244,000 years before the creation of Adam\r\naccording to Ussher.\r\n\r\nThe work of the old master is lightly incised on reindeer horn, and\r\nrepresents two horses, of a very early and heavy type, following one\r\nanother, with heads stretched forward, as if sniffing the air\r\nsuspiciously in search of enemies. The horses would certainly excite\r\nunfavourable comment at Newmarket. Their 'points' are undoubtedly coarse\r\nand clumsy: their heads are big, thick, stupid, and ungainly; their\r\nmanes are bushy and ill-defined; their legs are distinctly feeble and\r\nspindle-shaped; their tails more closely resemble the tail of the\r\ndomestic pig than that of the noble animal beloved with a love passing\r\nthe love of women by the English aristocracy. Nevertheless there is\r\nlittle (if any) reason to doubt that my very old master did, on the\r\nwhole, accurately represent the ancestral steed of his own exceedingly\r\nremote period. There were once horses even as is the horse of the\r\nprehistoric Dordonian artist. Such clumsy, big-headed brutes, dun in hue\r\nand striped down the back like modern donkeys, did actually once roam\r\nover the low plains where Paris now stands, and browse off lush grass\r\nand tall water-plants around the quays of Bordeaux and Lyons. Not only\r\ndo the bones of the contemporary horses, dug up in caves, prove this,\r\nbut quite recently the Russian traveller Prjevalsky (whose name is so\r\nmuch easier to spell than to pronounce) has discovered a similar living\r\nhorse, which drags on an obscure existence somewhere in the high\r\ntable-lands of Central Asia. Prjevalsky's horse (you see, as I have only\r\nto write the word, without uttering it, I don't mind how often or how\r\nintrepidly I use it) is so singularly like the clumsy brutes that sat,\r\nor rather stood, for their portraits to my old master that we can't do\r\nbetter than begin by describing him _in propria persona_.\r\n\r\nThe horse family of the present day is divided, like most other\r\nfamilies, into two factions, which may be described for variety's sake\r\nas those of the true horses and the donkeys, these latter including also\r\nthe zebras, quaggas, and various other unfamiliar creatures whose names,\r\nin very choice Latin, are only known to the more diligent visitors at\r\nthe Sunday Zoo. Now everybody must have noticed that the chief broad\r\ndistinction between these two great groups consists in the feathering of\r\nthe tail. The domestic donkey, with his near congeners, the zebra and\r\nco., have smooth short-haired tails, ending in a single bunch or\r\nfly-whisk of long hairs collected together in a tufted bundle at the\r\nextreme tip. The horse, on the other hand, besides having horny patches\r\nor callosities on both fore and hind legs, while the donkeys have them\r\non the fore legs only, has a hairy tail, in which the long hairs are\r\nalmost equally distributed from top to bottom, thus giving it its\r\npeculiarly bushy and brushy appearance. But Prjevalsky's horse, as one\r\nwould naturally expect from an early intermediate form, stands half-way\r\nin this respect between the two groups, and acts the thankless part of a\r\nfamily mediator; for it has most of its long tail-hairs collected in a\r\nfinal flourish, like the donkey, but several of them spring from the\r\nmiddle distance, as in the genuine Arab, though never from the very top,\r\nthus showing an approach to the true horsey habit without actually\r\nattaining that final pinnacle of equine glory. So far as one can make\r\nout from the somewhat rude handicraft of my prehistoric Phidias the\r\nhorse of the quaternary epoch had much the same caudal peculiarity; his\r\ntail was bushy, but only in the lower half. He was still in the\r\nintermediate stage between horse and donkey, a natural mule still\r\nstruggling up aspiringly toward perfect horsehood. In all other matters\r\nthe two creatures--the cave man's horse and Prjevalsky's--closely agree.\r\nBoth display large heads, thick necks, coarse manes, and a general\r\ndisregard of 'points' which would strike disgust and dismay into the\r\nstout breasts of Messrs. Tattersall. In fact over a T.Y.C. it may be\r\nconfidently asserted, in the pure Saxon of the sporting papers, that\r\nPrjevalsky's and the cave man's lot wouldn't be in it. Nevertheless a\r\ncandid critic would be forced to admit that, in spite of clumsiness,\r\nthey both mean staying.\r\n\r\nSo much for the two sitters; now let us turn to the artist who sketched\r\nthem. Who was he, and when did he live? Well, his name, like that of\r\nmany other old masters, is quite unknown to us; but what does that\r\nmatter so long as his work itself lives and survives? Like the Comtists\r\nhe has managed to obtain objective immortality. The work, after all, is\r\nfor the most part all we ever have to go upon. 'I have my own theory\r\nabout the authorship of the Iliad and Odyssey,' said Lewis Carroll (of\r\n'Alice in Wonderland') once in Christ Church common room: 'it is that\r\nthey weren't really written by Homer, but by another person of the same\r\nname.' There you have the Iliad in a nutshell as regards the\r\nauthenticity of great works. All we know about the supposed Homer (if\r\nanything) is that he was the reputed author of the two unapproachable\r\nGreek epics; and all we know directly about my old master, viewed\r\npersonally, is that he once carved with a rude flint flake on a fragment\r\nof reindeer horn these two clumsy prehistoric horses. Yet by putting two\r\nand two together we can make, not four, as might be naturally expected,\r\nbut a fairly connected history of the old master himself and what Mr.\r\nHerbert Spencer would no doubt playfully term 'his environment.'\r\n\r\nThe work of art was dug up from under the firm concreted floor of a cave\r\nin the Dordogne. That cave was once inhabited by the nameless artist\r\nhimself, his wife, and family. It had been previously tenanted by\r\nvarious other early families, as well as by bears, who seem to have\r\nlived there in the intervals between the different human occupiers.\r\nProbably the bears ejected the men, and the men in turn ejected the\r\nbears, by the summary process of eating one another up. In any case the\r\nfreehold of the cave was at last settled upon our early French artist.\r\nBut the date of his occupancy is by no means recent; for since he lived\r\nthere the long cold spell known as the Great Ice Age, or Glacial Epoch,\r\nhas swept over the whole of Northern Europe, and swept before it the\r\nshivering descendants of my poor prehistoric old master. Now, how long\r\nago was the Great Ice Age? As a rule, if you ask a geologist for a\r\ndefinite date, you will find him very chary of giving you a distinct\r\nanswer. He knows that the chalk is older than the London clay, and the\r\noolite than the chalk, and the red marl than the oolite; and he knows\r\nalso that each of them took a very long time indeed to lay down, but\r\nexactly how long he has no notion. If you say to him, 'Is it a million\r\nyears since the chalk was deposited?' he will answer, like the old lady\r\nof Prague, whose ideas were excessively vague, 'Perhaps.' If you suggest\r\nfive millions, he will answer oracularly once more, 'Perhaps'; and if\r\nyou go on to twenty millions, 'Perhaps,' with a broad smile, is still\r\nthe only confession of faith that torture will wring out of him. But in\r\nthe matter of the Glacial Epoch, a comparatively late and almost\r\nhistorical event, geologists have broken through their usual reserve on\r\nthis chronological question and condescended to give us a numerical\r\ndetermination. And here is how Dr. Croll gets at it.\r\n\r\nEvery now and again, geological evidence goes to show us, a long cold\r\nspell occurs in the northern or southern hemisphere. During these long\r\ncold spells the ice cap at the poles increases largely, till it spreads\r\nover a great part of what are now the temperate regions of the globe,\r\nand makes ice a mere drug in the market as far south as Covent Garden or\r\nthe Halles at Paris. During the greatest extension of this ice sheet in\r\nthe last glacial epoch, in fact, all England except a small\r\nsouth-western corner (about Torquay and Bournemouth) was completely\r\ncovered by one enormous mass of glaciers, as is still the case with\r\nalmost the whole of Greenland. The ice sheet, grinding slowly over the\r\nhills and rocks, smoothed and polished and striated their surfaces in\r\nmany places till they resembled the _roches moutonnées_ similarly ground\r\ndown in our own day by the moving ice rivers of Chamouni and\r\nGrindelwald. Now, since these great glaciations have occurred at various\r\nintervals in the world's past history, they must depend upon some\r\nfrequently recurring cause. Such a cause, therefore, Dr. Croll began\r\ningeniously to hunt about for.\r\n\r\nHe found it at last in the eccentricity of the earth's orbit. This world\r\nof ours, though usually steady enough in its movements, is at times\r\ndecidedly eccentric. Not that I mean to impute to our old and\r\nexceedingly respectable planet any occasional aberrations of intellect,\r\nor still less of morals (such as might be expected from Mars and Venus);\r\nthe word is here to be accepted strictly in its scientific or\r\nPickwickian sense as implying merely an irregularity of movement, a\r\nslight wobbling out of the established path, a deviation from exact\r\ncircularity. Owing to a combination of astronomical revolutions, the\r\nprecession of the equinoxes and the motion of the aphelion (I am not\r\ngoing to explain them here; the names alone will be quite sufficient for\r\nmost people; they will take the rest on trust)--owing to the\r\ncombination of these profoundly interesting causes, I say, there occur\r\ncertain periods in the world's life when for a very long time together\r\n(10,500 years, to be quite precise) the northern hemisphere is warmer\r\nthan the southern, or _vice versa_. Now, Dr. Croll has calculated that\r\nabout 250,000 years ago this eccentricity of the earth's orbit was at\r\nits highest, so that a cycle of recurring cold and warm epochs in either\r\nhemisphere alternately then set in; and such cold spells it was that\r\nproduced the Great Ice Age in Northern Europe. They went on till about\r\n80,000 years ago, when they stopped short for the present, leaving the\r\nclimate of Britain and the neighbouring continent with its existing\r\ninconvenient Laodicean temperature. And, as there are good reasons for\r\nbelieving that my old master and his contemporaries lived just before\r\nthe greatest cold of the Glacial Epoch, and that his immediate\r\ndescendants, with the animals on which they feasted, were driven out of\r\nEurope, or out of existence, by the slow approach of the enormous ice\r\nsheet, we may, I think, fairly conclude that his date was somewhere\r\nabout B.C. 248,000. In any case we must at least admit, with Mr. Andrew\r\nLang, the laureate of the twenty-five thousandth century, that\r\n\r\n    He lived in the long long agoes;\r\n    'Twas the manner of primitive man.\r\n\r\nThe old master, then, carved his bas-relief in pre-Glacial Europe, just\r\nat the moment before the temporary extinction of his race in France by\r\nthe coming on of the Great Ice Age. We can infer this fact from the\r\ncharacter of the fauna by which he was surrounded, a fauna in which\r\nspecies of cold and warm climates are at times quite capriciously\r\nintermingled. We get the reindeer and the mammoth side by side with the\r\nhippopotamus and the hyena; we find the chilly cave bear and the Norway\r\nlemming, the musk sheep and the Arctic fox in the same deposits with the\r\nlion and the lynx, the leopard and the rhinoceros. The fact is, as Mr.\r\nAlfred Russel Wallace has pointed out, we live to-day in a zoologically\r\nimpoverished world, from which all the largest, fiercest, and most\r\nremarkable animals have lately been weeded out. And it was in all\r\nprobability the coming on of the Ice Age that did the weeding. Our Zoo\r\ncan boast no mammoth and no mastodon. The sabre-toothed lion has gone\r\nthe way of all flesh; the deinotherium and the colossal ruminants of the\r\nPliocene Age no longer browse beside the banks of Seine. But our old\r\nmaster saw the last of some at least among those gigantic quadrupeds; it\r\nwas his hand or that of one among his fellows that scratched the famous\r\nmammoth etching on the ivory of La Madelaine and carved the figure of\r\nthe extinct cave bear on the reindeer-horn ornaments of Laugerie Basse.\r\nProbably, therefore, he lived in the period immediately preceding the\r\nGreat Ice Age, or else perhaps in one of the warm interglacial spells\r\nwith which the long secular winter of the northern hemisphere was then\r\nfrom time to time agreeably diversified.\r\n\r\nAnd what did the old master himself look like? Well, painters have\r\nalways been fond of reproducing their own lineaments. Have we not the\r\nfamiliar young Raffael, painted by himself, and the Rembrandt, and the\r\nTitian, and the Rubens, and a hundred other self-drawn portraits, all\r\nflattering and all famous? Even so primitive man has drawn himself many\r\ntimes over, not indeed on this particular piece of reindeer horn, but on\r\nseveral other media to be seen elsewhere, in the original or in good\r\ncopies. One of the best portraits is that discovered in the old cave at\r\nLaugerie Basse by M. Elie Massénat, where a very early pre-Glacial man\r\nis represented in the act of hunting an aurochs, at which he is casting\r\na flint-tipped javelin. In this, as in all other pictures of the same\r\nepoch, I regret to say that the ancient hunter is represented in the\r\ncostume of Adam before the fall. Our old master's studies, in fact, are\r\nall in the nude. Primitive man was evidently unacquainted as yet with\r\nthe use of clothing, though primitive woman, while still unclad, had\r\nalready learnt how to heighten her natural charms by the simple addition\r\nof a necklace and bracelets. Indeed, though dresses were still wholly\r\nunknown, rouge was even then extremely fashionable among French ladies,\r\nand lumps of the ruddle with which primitive woman made herself\r\nbeautiful for ever are now to be discovered in the corner of the cave\r\nwhere she had her little prehistoric boudoir. To return to our hunter,\r\nhowever, who for aught we know to the contrary may be our old master\r\nhimself in person, he is a rather crouching and semi-erect savage, with\r\nan arched back, recalling somewhat that of the gorilla, a round head,\r\nlong neck, pointed beard, and weak, shambling, ill-developed legs. I\r\nfear we must admit that pre-Glacial man cut, on the whole, a very sorry\r\nand awkward figure.\r\n\r\nWas he black? That we don't certainly know, but all analogy would lead\r\none to answer positively, Yes. White men seem, on the whole, to be a\r\nvery recent and novel improvement on the original evolutionary pattern.\r\nAt any rate he was distinctly hairy, like the Ainos, or aborigines of\r\nJapan, in our own day, of whom Miss Isabella Bird has drawn so startling\r\nand sensational a picture. Several of the pre-Glacial sketches show us\r\nlank and gawky savages with the body covered with long scratches,\r\nanswering exactly to the scratches which represent the hanging hair of\r\nthe mammoth, and suggesting that man then still retained his old\r\noriginal hairy covering. The few skulls and other fragments of\r\nskeletons now preserved to us also indicate that our old master and his\r\ncontemporaries much resembled in shape and build the Australian black\r\nfellows, though their foreheads were lower and more receding, while\r\ntheir front teeth still projected in huge fangs, faintly recalling the\r\nimmense canines of the male gorilla. Quite apart from any theoretical\r\nconsiderations as to our probable descent (or ascent) from Mr. Darwin's\r\nhypothetical 'hairy arboreal quadrumanous ancestor,' whose existence may\r\nor may not be really true, there can be no doubt that the actual\r\nhistorical remains set before us pre-Glacial man as evidently\r\napproaching in several important respects the higher monkeys.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note too that while the Men of the Time still\r\nretained (to be frankly evolutionary) many traces of the old monkey-like\r\nprogenitor, the horses which our old master has so cleverly delineated\r\nfor us on his scrap of horn similarly retained many traces of the\r\nearlier united horse-and-donkey ancestor. Professor Huxley has admirably\r\nreconstructed for us the pedigree of the horse, beginning with a little\r\ncreature from the Eocene beds of New Mexico, with five toes to each hind\r\nfoot, and ending with the modern horse, whose hoof is now practically\r\nreduced to a single and solid-nailed toe. Intermediate stages show us an\r\nUpper Eocene animal as big as a fox, with four toes on his front feet\r\nand three behind; a Miocene kind as big as a sheep, with only three toes\r\non the front foot, the two outer of which are smaller than the big\r\nmiddle one; and finally a Pliocene form, as big as a donkey, with one\r\nstout middle toe, the real hoof, flanked by two smaller ones, too short\r\nby far to reach the ground. In our own horse these lateral toes have\r\nbecome reduced to what are known by veterinaries as splint bones,\r\ncombined with the canon in a single solidly morticed piece. But in the\r\npre-Glacial horses the splint bones still generally remained quite\r\ndistinct, thus pointing back to the still earlier period when they\r\nexisted as two separate and independent side toes in the ancestral\r\nquadruped. In a few cave specimens, however, the splints are found\r\nunited with the canons in a single piece, while conversely horses are\r\nsometimes, though very rarely, born at the present day with three-toed\r\nfeet, exactly resembling those of their half-forgotten ancestor, the\r\nPliocene hipparion.\r\n\r\nThe reason why we know so much about the horses of the cave period is, I\r\nam bound to admit, simply and solely because the man of the period ate\r\nthem. Hippophagy has always been popular in France; it was practised by\r\npre-Glacial man in the caves of Périgord, and revived with immense\r\nenthusiasm by the gourmets of the Boulevards after the siege of Paris\r\nand the hunger of the Commune. The cave men hunted and killed the wild\r\nhorse of their own times, and one of the best of their remaining works\r\nof art represents a naked hunter attacking two horses, while a huge\r\nsnake winds itself unperceived behind close to his heel. In this rough\r\nprehistoric sketch one seems to catch some faint antique foreshadowing\r\nof the rude humour of the 'Petit Journal pour Rire.' Some archæologists\r\neven believe that the horse was domesticated by the cave men as a source\r\nof food, and argue that the familiarity with its form shown in the\r\ndrawings could only have been acquired by people who knew the animal in\r\nits domesticated state; they declare that the cave man was obviously\r\nhorsey. But all the indications seem to me to show that tame animals\r\nwere quite unknown in the age of the cave men. The mammoth certainly was\r\nnever domesticated; yet there is a famous sketch of the huge beast upon\r\na piece of his own ivory, discovered in the cave of La Madelaine by\r\nMessrs. Lartet and Christy, and engraved a hundred times in works on\r\narchæology, which forms one of the finest existing relics of pre-Glacial\r\nart. In another sketch, less well known, but not unworthy of admiration,\r\nthe early artist has given us with a few rapid but admirable strokes his\r\nown reminiscence of the effect produced upon him by the sudden onslaught\r\nof the hairy brute, tusks erect and mouth wide open, a perfect glimpse\r\nof elephantine fury. It forms a capital example of early impressionism,\r\nrespectfully recommended to the favourable attention of Mr. J.M.\r\nWhistler.\r\n\r\nThe reindeer, however, formed the favourite food and favourite model of\r\nthe pre-Glacial artists. Perhaps it was a better sitter than the\r\nmammoth; certainly it is much more frequently represented on these early\r\nprehistoric bas-reliefs. The high-water mark of palæolithic art is\r\nundoubtedly to be found in the reindeer of the cave of Thayngen, in\r\nSwitzerland, a capital and spirited representation of a buck grazing, in\r\nwhich the perspective of the two horns is better managed than a Chinese\r\nartist would manage it at the present day. Another drawing of two\r\nreindeer fighting, scratched on a fragment of schistose rock and\r\nunearthed in one of the caves of Périgord, though far inferior to the\r\nSwiss specimen in spirit and execution, is yet not without real merit.\r\nThe perspective, however, displays one marked infantile trait, for the\r\nhead and legs of one deer are seen distinctly through the body of\r\nanother. Cave bears, fish, musk sheep, foxes, and many other extinct or\r\nexisting animals are also found among the archaic sculptures. Probably\r\nall these creatures were used as food; and it is even doubtful whether\r\nthe artistic troglodytes were not also confirmed cannibals. To quote Mr.\r\nAndrew Lang once more on primitive man, 'he lived in a cave by the seas;\r\nhe lived upon oysters and foes.' The oysters are quite undoubted, and the\r\nfoes may be inferred with considerable certainty.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of our old master more than once under this rather\r\nquestion-begging style and title of primitive man. In reality, however,\r\nthe very facts which I have here been detailing serve themselves to show\r\nhow extremely far our hero was from being truly primitive. You can't\r\nspeak of a distinguished artist, who draws the portraits of extinct\r\nanimals with grace and accuracy, as in any proper sense primordial.\r\nGrant that our good troglodytes were indeed light-hearted cannibals;\r\nnevertheless they could design far better than the modern Esquimaux or\r\nPolynesians, and carve far better than the civilised being who is now\r\ncalmly discoursing about their personal peculiarities in his own study.\r\nBetween the cave men of the pre-Glacial age and the hypothetical hairy\r\nquadrumanous ancestor aforesaid there must have intervened innumerable\r\ngenerations of gradually improving intermediate forms. The old master,\r\nwhen he first makes his bow to us, naked and not ashamed, in his Swiss\r\nor French grotto, flint scalpel in hand and necklet of bear's teeth\r\ndropping loosely on his hairy bosom, is nevertheless in all essentials a\r\ncompletely evolved human being, with a whole past of slowly acquired\r\nculture lying dimly and mysteriously behind him. Already he had invented\r\nthe bow with its flint-tipped arrow, the neatly chipped javelin-head,\r\nthe bone harpoon, the barbed fish-hook, the axe, the lance, the dagger,\r\nand the needle. Already he had learnt how to decorate his implements\r\nwith artistic skill, and to carve the handles of his knives with the\r\nfigures of animals. I have no doubt that he even knew how to brew and to\r\ndistil; and he was probably acquainted with the noble art of cookery as\r\napplied to the persons of his human fellow creatures. Such a personage\r\ncannot reasonably be called primitive; cannibalism, as somebody has\r\nrightly remarked, is the first step on the road to civilisation.\r\n\r\nNo, if we want to get at genuine, unadulterated primitive man we must go\r\nmuch further back in time than the mere trifle of 250,000 years with\r\nwhich Dr. Croll and the cosmic astronomers so generously provide us for\r\npre-Glacial humanity. We must turn away to the immeasurably earlier\r\nfire-split flints which the Abbé Bourgeois--undaunted mortal!--ventured\r\nto discover among the Miocene strata of the _calcaire de Beauce_. Those\r\nflints, if of human origin at all, were fashioned by some naked and\r\nstill more hairy creature who might fairly claim to be considered as\r\ngenuinely primitive. So rude are they that, though evidently artificial,\r\none distinguished archæologist will not admit they can be in any way\r\nhuman; he will have it that they were really the handiwork of the great\r\nEuropean anthropoid ape of that early period. This, however, is nothing\r\nmore than very delicate hair-splitting; for what does it matter whether\r\nyou call the animal that fashioned these exceedingly rough and\r\nfire-marked implements a man-like ape or an ape-like human being? The\r\nfact remains quite unaltered, whichever name you choose to give to it.\r\nWhen you have got to a monkey who can light a fire and proceed to\r\nmanufacture himself a convenient implement, you may be sure that man,\r\nnoble man, with all his glorious and admirable faculties--cannibal or\r\notherwise--is lurking somewhere very close just round the corner. The\r\nmore we examine the work of our old master, in fact, the more does the\r\nconviction force itself upon us that he was very far indeed from being\r\nprimitive--that we must push back the early history of our race not for\r\n250,000 winters alone, but perhaps for two or three million years into\r\nthe dim past of Tertiary ages.\r\n\r\nBut if pre-Glacial man is thus separated from the origin of the race by\r\na very long interval indeed, it is none the less true that he is\r\nseparated from our own time by the intervention of a vast blank space,\r\nthe space occupied by the coming on and passing away of the Glacial\r\nEpoch. A great gap cuts him off from what we may consider as the\r\nrelatively modern age of the mound-builders, whose grassy barrows still\r\ncap the summits of our southern chalk downs. When the great ice sheet\r\ndrove away palæolithic man--the man of the caves and the unwrought flint\r\naxes--from Northern Europe, he was still nothing more than a naked\r\nsavage in the hunting stage, divinely gifted for art, indeed, but armed\r\nonly with roughly chipped stone implements, and wholly ignorant of\r\ntaming animals or of the very rudiments of agriculture. He knew nothing\r\nof the use of metals--_aurum irrepertum spernere fortior_--and he had\r\nnot even learnt how to grind and polish his rude stone tomahawks to a\r\nfinished edge. He couldn't make himself a bowl of sun-baked pottery,\r\nand, if he had discovered the almost universal art of manufacturing an\r\nintoxicating liquor from grain or berries (for, as Byron, with too great\r\nanthropological truth, justly remarks, 'man, being reasonable, _must_\r\nget drunk'), he at least drank his aboriginal beer or toddy from the\r\ncapacious horn of a slaughtered aurochs. That was the kind of human\r\nbeing who alone inhabited France and England during the later\r\npre-Glacial period.\r\n\r\nA hundred and seventy thousand years elapse (as the play-bills put it),\r\nand then the curtain rises afresh upon neolithic Europe. Man meanwhile,\r\nloitering somewhere behind the scenes in Asia or Africa (as yet\r\nimperfectly explored from this point of view), had acquired the\r\nimportant arts of sharpening his tomahawks and producing hand-made\r\npottery for his kitchen utensils. When the great ice sheet cleared away\r\nhe followed the returning summer into Northern Europe, another man,\r\nphysically, intellectually, and morally, with all the slow accumulations\r\nof nearly two thousand centuries (how easily one writes the words! how\r\nhard to realise them!) upon his maturer shoulders. Then comes the age\r\nof what older antiquaries used to regard as primitive antiquity--the age\r\nof the English barrows, of the Danish kitchen middens, of the Swiss lake\r\ndwellings. The men who lived in it had domesticated the dog, the cow,\r\nthe sheep, the goat, and the invaluable pig; they had begun to sow small\r\nancestral wheat and undeveloped barley; they had learnt to weave flax\r\nand wear decent clothing: in a word, they had passed from the savage\r\nhunting condition to the stage of barbaric herdsmen and agriculturists.\r\nThat is a comparatively modern period, and yet I suppose we must\r\nconclude with Dr. James Geikie that it isn't to be measured by mere\r\ncalculations of ten or twenty centuries, but of ten or twenty thousand\r\nyears. The perspective of the past is opening up rapidly before us; what\r\nlooked quite close yesterday is shown to-day to lie away off somewhere\r\nin the dim distance. Like our paleolithic artists, we fail to get the\r\nreindeer fairly behind the ox in the foreground, as we ought to do if we\r\nsaw the whole scene properly foreshortened.\r\n\r\nOn the table where I write there lie two paper-weights, preserving from\r\nthe fate of the sibylline leaves the sheets of foolscap to which this\r\nessay is now being committed. One of them is a very rude flint hatchet,\r\nproduced by merely chipping off flakes from its side by dexterous blows,\r\nand utterly unpolished or unground in any way. It belongs to the age of\r\nthe very old master (or possibly even to a slightly earlier epoch), and\r\nit was sent me from Ightham, in Kent, by that indefatigable unearther of\r\nprehistoric memorials, Mr. Benjamin Harrison. That flint, which now\r\nserves me in the office of a paper-weight, is far ruder, simpler, and\r\nmore ineffective than any weapon or implement at present in use among\r\nthe lowest savages. Yet with it, I doubt not, some naked black fellow by\r\nthe banks of the Thames has hunted the mammoth among unbroken forest\r\ntwo hundred thousand years ago and more; with it he has faced the angry\r\ncave bear and the original and only genuine British lion (for everybody\r\nknows that the existing mongrel heraldic beast is nothing better than a\r\nbastard modification of the leopard of the Plantagenets). Nay, I have\r\nvery little doubt in my own mind that with it some æsthetic ancestor has\r\nbrained and cut up for his use his next-door neighbour in the nearest\r\ncavern, and then carved upon his well-picked bones an interesting sketch\r\nof the entire performance. The Du Mauriers of that remote age, in fact,\r\nhabitually drew their society pictures upon the personal remains of the\r\nmammoth or the man whom they wished to caricature in deathless\r\nbone-cuts. The other paper-weight is a polished neolithic tomahawk,\r\nbelonging to the period of the mound-builders, who succeeded the Glacial\r\nEpoch, and it measures the distance between the two levels of\r\ncivilisation with great accuracy. It is the military weapon of a trained\r\nbarbaric warrior as opposed to the universal implement and utensil of a\r\nrude, solitary, savage hunter. Yet how curious it is that even in the\r\nmidst of this 'so-called nineteenth century,' which perpetually\r\nproclaims itself an age of progress, men should still prefer to believe\r\nthemselves inferior to their original ancestors, instead of being\r\nsuperior to them! The idea that man has risen is considered base,\r\ndegrading, and positively wicked; the idea that he has fallen is\r\nconsidered to be immensely inspiring, ennobling, and beautiful. For\r\nmyself, I have somehow always preferred the boast of the Homeric Glaucus\r\nthat we indeed maintain ourselves to be much better men than ever were\r\nour fathers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBRITISH AND FOREIGN\r\n\r\n\r\nStrictly speaking, there is nothing really and truly British; everybody\r\nand everything is a naturalised alien. Viewed as Britons, we all of us,\r\nhuman and animal, differ from one another simply in the length of time\r\nwe and our ancestors have continuously inhabited this favoured and foggy\r\nisle of Britain. Look, for example, at the men and women of us. Some of\r\nus, no doubt, are more or less remotely of Norman blood, and came over,\r\nlike that noble family the Slys, with Richard Conqueror. Others of us,\r\nperhaps, are in the main Scandinavian, and date back a couple of\r\ngenerations earlier, to the bare-legged followers of Canute and Guthrum.\r\nYet others, once more, are true Saxon Englishmen, descendants of\r\nHengest, if there ever was a Hengest, or of Horsa, if a genuine Horsa\r\never actually existed. None of these, it is quite clear, have any just\r\nright or title to be considered in the last resort as true-born Britons;\r\nthey are all of them just as much foreigners at bottom as the\r\nSpitalfields Huguenots or the Pembrokeshire Flemings, the Italian\r\norgan-boy and the Hindoo prince disguised as a crossing-sweeper. But\r\nsurely the Welshman and the Highland Scot at least are undeniable\r\nBritishers, sprung from the soil and to the manner born! Not a bit of\r\nit; inexorable modern science, diving back remorselessly into the\r\nremoter past, traces the Cymry across the face of Germany, and fixes in\r\nshadowy hypothetical numbers the exact date, to a few centuries, of the\r\nfirst prehistoric Gaelic invasion. Even the still earlier brown\r\nEuskarians and yellow Mongolians, who held the land before the advent of\r\nthe ancient Britons, were themselves immigrants; the very Autochthones\r\nin person turn out, on close inspection, to be vagabonds and wanderers\r\nand foreign colonists. In short, man as a whole is not an indigenous\r\nanimal at all in the British Isles. Be he who he may, when we push his\r\npedigree back to its prime original, we find him always arriving in the\r\nend by the Dover steamer or the Harwich packet. Five years, in fact, are\r\nquite sufficient to give him a legal title to letters of naturalisation,\r\nunless indeed he be a German grand-duke, in which case he can always\r\nbecome an Englishman off-hand by Act of Parliament.\r\n\r\nIt is just the same with all the other animals and plants that now\r\ninhabit these isles of Britain. If there be anything at all with a claim\r\nto be considered really indigenous, it is the Scotch ptarmigan and the\r\nAlpine hare, the northern holygrass and the mountain flowers of the\r\nHighland summits. All the rest are sojourners and wayfarers, brought\r\nacross as casuals, like the gipsies and the Oriental plane, at various\r\ntimes to the United Kingdom, some of them recently, some of them long\r\nago, but not one of them (it seems), except the oyster, a true native.\r\nThe common brown rat, for instance, as everybody knows, came over, not,\r\nit is true, with William the Conqueror, but with the Hanoverian dynasty\r\nand King George I. of blessed memory. The familiar cockroach, or 'black\r\nbeetle,' of our lower regions, is an Oriental importation of the last\r\ncentury. The hum of the mosquito is now just beginning to be heard in\r\nthe land, especially in some big London hotels. The Colorado beetle is\r\nhourly expected by Cunard steamer. The Canadian roadside erigeron is\r\nwell established already in the remoter suburbs; the phylloxera battens\r\non our hothouse vines; the American river-weed stops the navigation on\r\nour principal canals. The Ganges and the Mississippi have long since\r\nflooded the tawny Thames, as Juvenal's cynical friend declared the\r\nSyrian Orontes had flooded the Tiber. And what has thus been going on\r\nslowly within the memory of the last few generations has been going on\r\nconstantly from time immemorial, and peopling Britain in all its parts\r\nwith its now existing fauna and flora.\r\n\r\nBut if all the plants and animals in our islands are thus ultimately\r\nimported, the question naturally arises, What was there in Great Britain\r\nand Ireland before any of their present inhabitants came to inherit\r\nthem? The answer is, succinctly, Nothing. Or if this be a little too\r\nextreme, then let us imitate the modesty of Mr. Gilbert's hero and\r\nmodify the statement into Hardly anything. In England, as in Northern\r\nEurope generally, modern history begins, not with the reign of Queen\r\nElizabeth, but with the passing away of the Glacial Epoch. During that\r\ngreat age of universal ice our Britain, from end to end, was covered at\r\nvarious times by sea and by glaciers; it resembled on the whole the\r\ncheerful aspect of Spitzbergen or Nova Zembla at the present day. A few\r\nreindeer wandered now and then over its frozen shores; a scanty\r\nvegetation of the correlative reindeer-moss grew with difficulty under\r\nthe sheets and drifts of endless snow; a stray walrus or an occasional\r\nseal basked in the chilly sunshine on the ice-bound coast. But during\r\nthe greatest extension of the North-European ice-sheet it is probable\r\nthat life in London was completely extinct; the metropolitan area did\r\nnot even vegetate. Snow and snow and snow and snow was then the short\r\nsum-total of British scenery. Murray's Guides were rendered quite\r\nunnecessary, and penny ices were a drug in the market. England was given\r\nup to one unchanging universal winter.\r\n\r\nSlowly, however, times altered, as they are much given to doing; and a\r\nnew era dawned upon Britain. The thermometer rose rapidly, or at least\r\nit would have risen, with effusion, if it had yet been invented. The\r\nland emerged from the sea, and southern plants and animals began to\r\ninvade the area that was afterwards to be England, across the broad belt\r\nwhich then connected us with the Continental system. But in those days\r\ncommunications were slow and land transit difficult. You had to foot it.\r\nThe European fauna and flora moved but gradually and tentatively\r\nnorth-westward, and before any large part of it could settle in England\r\nour island was finally cut off from the mainland by the long and gradual\r\nwearing away of the cliffs at Dover and Calais. That accounts for the\r\ncomparative poverty of animal and vegetable life in England, and still\r\nmore for its extreme paucity and meagreness in Ireland and the\r\nHighlands. It has been erroneously asserted, for example, that St.\r\nPatrick expelled snakes and lizards, frogs and toads, from the soil of\r\nErin. This detail, as the French newspapers politely phrase it, is\r\ninexact. St. Patrick did not expel the reptiles, because there were\r\nnever any reptiles in Ireland (except dynamiters) for him to expel. The\r\ncreatures never got so far on their long and toilsome north-westward\r\nmarch before St. George's Channel intervened to prevent their passage\r\nacross to Dublin. It is really, therefore, to St. George, rather than to\r\nSt. Patrick, that the absence of toads and snakes from the soil of\r\nIreland is ultimately due. The doubtful Cappadocian prelate is well\r\nknown to have been always death on dragons and serpents.\r\n\r\nAs long ago as the sixteenth century, indeed, Verstegan the antiquary\r\nclearly saw that the existence of badgers and foxes in England implied\r\nthe former presence of a belt of land joining the British Islands to the\r\nContinent of Europe; for, as he acutely observed, nobody (before\r\nfox-hunting, at least) would ever have taken the trouble to bring them\r\nover. Still more does the presence in our islands of the red deer, and\r\nformerly of the wild white cattle, the wolf, the bear, and the wild\r\nboar, to say nothing of the beaver, the otter, the squirrel, and the\r\nweasel, prove that England was once conterminous with France or Belgium.\r\nAt the very best of times, however, before Sir Ewen Cameron of Lochiel\r\nhad killed positively the last 'last wolf' in Britain (several other\r\n'last wolves' having previously been despatched by various earlier\r\nintrepid exterminators), our English fauna was far from a rich one,\r\nespecially as regards the larger quadrupeds. In bats, birds, and insects\r\nwe have always done better, because to such creatures a belt of sea is\r\nnot by any means an insuperable barrier; whereas in reptiles and\r\namphibians, on the contrary, we have always been weak, seeing that most\r\nreptiles are bad swimmers, and very few can rival the late lamented\r\nCaptain Webb in his feat of crossing the Channel, as Leander and Lord\r\nByron did the Hellespont.\r\n\r\nOnly one good-sized animal, so far as known, is now peculiar to the\r\nBritish Isles, and that is our familiar friend the red grouse of the\r\nScotch moors. I doubt, however, whether even he is really indigenous in\r\nthe strictest sense of the word: that is to say, whether he was evolved\r\nin and for these islands exclusively, as the moa and the apteryx were\r\nevolved for New Zealand, and the extinct dodo for Mauritius alone. It is\r\nfar more probable that the red grouse is the original variety of the\r\nwillow grouse of Scandinavia, which has retained throughout the year its\r\nold plumage, while its more northern cousins among the fiords and fjelds\r\nhave taken, under stress of weather, to donning a complete white dress\r\nin winter, and a grey or speckled tourist suit for the summer season.\r\n\r\nEven since the insulation of Britain a great many new plants and\r\nanimals have been added to our population, both by human design and in\r\nseveral other casual fashions. The fallow deer is said to have been\r\nintroduced by the Romans, and domesticated ever since in the successive\r\nparks of Celt and Saxon, Dane and Norman. The edible snail, still\r\nscattered thinly over our southern downs, and abundant at Box Hill and a\r\nfew other spots in Surrey or Sussex, was brought over, they tell us, by\r\nthe same luxurious Italian epicures, and is even now confined,\r\nimaginative naturalists declare, to the immediate neighbourhood of Roman\r\nstations. The mediæval monks, in like manner, introduced the carp for\r\ntheir Friday dinners. One of our commonest river mussels at the present\r\nday did not exist in England at all a century ago, but was ferried\r\nhither from the Volga, clinging to the bottoms of vessels from the Black\r\nSea, and has now spread itself through all our brooks and streams to the\r\nvery heart and centre of England. Thus, from day to day, as in society\r\nat large, new introductions constantly take place, and old friends die\r\nout for ever. The brown rat replaces the old English black rat; strange\r\nweeds kill off the weeds of ancient days; fresh flies and grubs and\r\nbeetles crop up, and disturb the primitive entomological balance. The\r\nbustard is gone from Salisbury Plain; the fenland butterflies have\r\ndisappeared with the drainage of the fens. In their place the red-legged\r\npartridge invades Norfolk; the American black bass is making himself\r\nquite at home, with Yankee assurance, in our sluggish rivers; and the\r\nspoonbill is nesting of its own accord among the warmer corners of the\r\nSussex downs.\r\n\r\nIn the plant world, substitution often takes place far more rapidly. I\r\ndoubt whether the stinging nettle, which renders picnicking a nuisance\r\nin England, is truly indigenous; certainly the two worst kinds, the\r\nsmaller nettle and the Roman nettle, are quite recent denizens, never\r\nstraying, even at the present day, far from the precincts of farmyards\r\nand villages. The shepherd's-purse and many other common garden weeds of\r\ncultivation are of Eastern origin, and came to us at first with the\r\nseed-corn and the peas from the Mediterranean region. Corn-cockles and\r\ncorn-flowers are equally foreign and equally artificial; even the\r\nscarlet poppy, seldom found except in wheat-fields or around waste\r\nplaces in villages, has probably followed the course of tillage from\r\nsome remote and ancient Eastern origin. There is a pretty blue veronica\r\nwhich was unknown in England some thirty years since, but which then\r\nbegan to spread in gardens, and is now one of the commonest and most\r\ntroublesome weeds throughout the whole country. Other familiar wild\r\nplants have first been brought over as garden flowers. There is the\r\nwall-flower, for instance, now escaped from cultivation in every part of\r\nBritain, and mantling with its yellow bunches both old churches and\r\nhouses and also the crannies of the limestone cliffs around half the\r\nshores of England. The common stock has similarly overrun the sea-front\r\nof the Isle of Wight; the monkey-plant, originally a Chilian flower, has\r\nrun wild in many boggy spots in England and Wales; and a North American\r\nbalsam, seldom cultivated even in cottage gardens, has managed to\r\nestablish itself in profuse abundance along the banks of the Wey about\r\nGuildford and Godalming. One little garden linaria, at first employed as\r\nan ornament for hanging-baskets, has become so common on old walls and\r\nbanks as to be now considered a mere weed, and exterminated accordingly\r\nby fashionable gardeners. Such are the unaccountable reverses of\r\nfortune, that one age will pay fifty guineas a bulb for a plant which\r\nthe next age grubs up unanimously as a vulgar intruder. White of\r\nSelborne noticed with delight in his own kitchen that rare insect, the\r\nOriental cockroach, lately imported; and Mr. Brewer observed with joy\r\nin his garden at Reigate the blue Buxbaum speedwell, which is now the\r\nacknowledged and hated pest of the Surrey agriculturist.\r\n\r\nThe history of some of these waifs and strays which go to make up the\r\nwider population of Britain is indeed sufficiently remarkable. Like all\r\nislands, England has a fragmentary fauna and flora, whose members have\r\noften drifted towards it in the most wonderful and varied manner.\r\nSometimes they bear witness to ancient land connections, as in the case\r\nof the spotted Portuguese slug which Professor Allman found calmly\r\ndisporting itself on the basking cliffs in the Killarney district. In\r\nformer days, when Spain and Ireland joined hands in the middle of the\r\nBay of Biscay, the ancestors of this placid Lusitanian mollusk must have\r\nranged (good word to apply to slugs) from the groves of Cintra to the\r\nCove of Cork. But, as time rolled on, the cruel crawling sea rolled on\r\nalso, and cut away all the western world from the foot of the Asturias\r\nto Macgillicuddy's Reeks. So the spotted slug continued to survive in\r\ntwo distinct and divided bodies, a large one in South-western Europe,\r\nand a small isolated colony, all alone by itself, around the Kerry\r\nmountains and the Lakes of Killarney. At other times pure accident\r\naccounts for the presence of a particular species in the mainlands of\r\nBritain. For example, the Bermuda grass-lily, a common American plant,\r\nis known in a wild state nowhere in Europe save at a place called\r\nWoodford, in county Galway. Nobody ever planted it there; it has simply\r\nsprung up from some single seed, carried over, perhaps, on the feet of a\r\nbird, or cast ashore by the Gulf Stream on the hospitable coast of\r\nWestern Ireland. Yet there it has flourished and thriven ever since, a\r\nnaturalised British subject of undoubted origin, without ever spreading\r\nto north or south above a few miles from its adopted habitat.\r\n\r\nThere are several of these unconscious American importations in various\r\nparts of Britain, some of them, no doubt, brought over with seed-corn or\r\namong the straw of packing-cases, but others unconnected in any way with\r\nhuman agency, and owing their presence here to natural causes. That\r\npretty little Yankee weed, the claytonia, now common in parts of\r\nLancashire and Oxfordshire, first made its appearance amongst us, I\r\nbelieve, by its seeds being accidentally included with the sawdust in\r\nwhich Wenham Lake ice is packed for transport. The Canadian river-weed\r\nis known first to have escaped from the botanical gardens at Cambridge,\r\nwhence it spread rapidly through the congenial dykes and sluices of the\r\nfen country, and so into the entire navigable network of the Midland\r\ncounties. But there are other aliens of older settlement amongst us,\r\naliens of American origin which nevertheless arrived in Britain, in all\r\nprobability, long before Columbus ever set foot on the low basking\r\nsandbank of Cat Island. Such is the jointed pond-sedge of the Hebrides,\r\na water-weed found abundantly in the lakes and tarns of the Isle of\r\nSkye, Mull and Coll, and the west coast of Ireland, but occurring\r\nnowhere else throughout the whole expanse of Europe or Asia. How did it\r\nget there? Clearly its seeds were either washed by the waves or carried\r\nby birds, and thus deposited on the nearest European shores to America.\r\nBut if Mr. Alfred Russel Wallace had been alive in pre-Columban days\r\n(which, as Euclid remarks, is absurd), he would readily have inferred,\r\nfrom the frequent occurrence of such unknown plants along the western\r\nverge of Britain, that a great continent lay unexplored to the westward,\r\nand would promptly have proceeded to discover and annex it. As Mr.\r\nWallace was not yet born, however, Columbus took a mean advantage over\r\nhim, and discovered it first by mere right of primogeniture.\r\n\r\nIn other cases, the circumstances under which a particular plant appears\r\nin England are often very suspicious. Take the instance of the\r\nbelladonna, or deadly nightshade, an extremely rare British species,\r\nfound only in the immediate neighbourhood of old castles and monastic\r\nbuildings. Belladonna, of course, is a deadly poison, and was much used\r\nin the half-magical, half-criminal sorceries of the Middle Ages. Did you\r\nwish to remove a troublesome rival or an elder brother, you treated him\r\nto a dose of deadly nightshade. Yet why should it, in company with many\r\nother poisonous exotics, be found so frequently around the ruins of\r\nmonasteries? Did the holy fathers--but no, the thought is too\r\nirreverent. Let us keep our illusions, and forget the friar and the\r\napothecary in 'Romeo and Juliet.'\r\n\r\nBelladonna has never fairly taken root in English soil. It remains, like\r\nthe Roman snail and the Portuguese slug, a mere casual straggler about\r\nits ancient haunts. But there are other plants which have fairly\r\nestablished their claim to be considered as native-born Britons, though\r\nthey came to us at first as aliens and colonists from foreign parts.\r\nSuch, to take a single case, is the history of the common alexanders,\r\nnow a familiar weed around villages and farmyards, but only introduced\r\ninto England as a pot-herb about the eighth or ninth century. It was\r\nlong grown in cottage gardens for table purposes, but has for ages been\r\nsuperseded in that way by celery. Nevertheless, it continues to grow all\r\nabout our lanes and hedges, side by side with another quaintly-named\r\nplant, bishop-weed or gout-weed, whose very titles in themselves bear\r\ncurious witness to its original uses in this isle of Britain. I don't\r\nknow why, but it is an historical fact that the early prelates of the\r\nEnglish Church, saintly or otherwise, were peculiarly liable to that\r\nvery episcopal disease, the gout. Whether their frequent fasting\r\nproduced this effect; whether, as they themselves piously alleged, it\r\nwas due to constant kneeling on the cold stones of churches; or whether,\r\nas their enemies rather insinuated, it was due in greater measure to the\r\nexcellent wines presented to them by their Italian _confrères_, is a\r\nminute question to be decided by Mr. Freeman, not by the present humble\r\ninquirer. But the fact remains that bishops and gout got indelibly\r\nassociated in the public mind; that the episcopal toes were looked upon\r\nas especially subject to that insidious disease up to the very end of\r\nthe last century; and that they do say the bishops even now--but I\r\nrefrain from the commission of _scandalum magnatum_. Anyhow, this\r\nparticular weed was held to be a specific for the bishop's evil; and,\r\nbeing introduced and cultivated for the purpose, it came to be known\r\nindifferently to herbalists as bishop-weed and gout-weed. It has now\r\nlong since ceased to be a recognised member of the British\r\nPharmacopoeia, but, having overrun our lanes and thickets in its\r\nflush period, it remains to this day a visible botanical and\r\netymological memento of the past twinges of episcopal remorse.\r\n\r\nTaken as a whole, one may fairly say that the total population of the\r\nBritish Isles consists mainly of three great elements. The first and\r\noldest--the only one with any real claim to be considered as truly\r\nnative--is the cold Northern, Alpine and Arctic element, comprising such\r\nanimals as the white hare of Scotland, the ptarmigan, the pine marten,\r\nand the capercailzie--the last once extinct, and now reintroduced into\r\nthe Highlands as a game bird. This very ancient fauna and flora, left\r\nbehind soon after the Glacial Epoch, and perhaps in part a relic of the\r\ntype which still struggled on in favoured spots during that terrible\r\nperiod of universal ice and snow, now survives for the most part only in\r\nthe extreme north and on the highest and chilliest mountain-tops, where\r\nit has gradually been driven, like tourists in August, by the increasing\r\nwarmth and sultriness of the southern lowlands. The summits of the\r\nprincipal Scotch hills are occupied by many Arctic plants, now slowly\r\ndying out, but lingering yet as last relics of that old native British\r\nflora. The Alpine milk vetch thus loiters among the rocks of Braemar and\r\nClova; the Arctic brook-saxifrage flowers but sparingly near the summit\r\nof Ben Lawers, Ben Nevis, and Lochnagar; its still more northern ally,\r\nthe drooping saxifrage, is now extinct in all Britain, save on a single\r\nsnowy Scotch height, where it now rarely blossoms, and will soon become\r\naltogether obsolete. There are other northern plants of this first and\r\noldest British type, like the Ural oxytrope, the cloudberry, and the\r\nwhite dryas, which remain as yet even in the moors of Yorkshire, or over\r\nconsiderable tracts in the Scotch Highlands; there are others restricted\r\nto a single spot among the Welsh hills, an isolated skerry among the\r\nouter Hebrides, or a solitary summit in the Lake District. But wherever\r\nthey linger, these true-born Britons of the old rock are now but\r\nstrangers and outcasts in the land; the intrusive foreigner has driven\r\nthem to die on the cold mountain-tops, as the Celt drove the Mongolian\r\nto the hills, and the Saxon, in turn, has driven the Celt to the\r\nHighlands and the islands. Yet as late as the twelfth century itself,\r\neven the true reindeer, the Arctic monarch of the Glacial Epoch, was\r\nstill hunted by Norwegian jarls of Orkney on the mainland of Caithness\r\nand Sutherlandshire.\r\n\r\nSecond in age is the warm western and south-western type, the type\r\nrepresented by the Portuguese slug, the arbutus trees and Mediterranean\r\nheaths of the Killarney district, the flora of Cornwall and the Scilly\r\nIsles, and the peculiar wild flowers of South Wales, Devonshire, and the\r\nwest country generally. This class belongs by origin to the submerged\r\nland of Lyonesse, the warm champaign country that once spread westward\r\nover the Bay of Biscay, and derived from the Gulf Stream the genial\r\nclimate still preserved by its last remnants at Tresco and St. Mary's.\r\nThe animals belonging to this secondary stratum of our British\r\npopulation are few and rare, but of its plants there are not a few, some\r\nof them extending over the whole western shores of England, Wales,\r\nScotland, and Ireland, wherever they are washed by the Gulf Stream, and\r\nothers now confined to particular spots, often with the oddest apparent\r\ncapriciousness. Thus, two or three southern types of clover are peculiar\r\nto the Lizard Point, in Cornwall; a little Spanish and Italian\r\nrestharrow has got stranded in the Channel Islands and on the Mull of\r\nGalloway; the spotted rock-rose of the Mediterranean grows only in\r\nKerry, Galway, and Anglesea; while other plants of the same warm habit\r\nare confined to such spots as Torquay, Babbicombe, Dawlish, Cork,\r\nSwansea, Axminster, and the Scilly Isles. Of course, all peninsulas and\r\nislands are warmer in temperature than inland places, and so these\r\nrelics of the lost Lyonesse have survived here and there in Cornwall,\r\nCarnarvonshire, Kerry, and other very projecting headlands long after\r\nthey have died out altogether from the main central mass of Britain.\r\nSouth-western Ireland in particular is almost Portuguese in the general\r\naspect of its fauna and flora.\r\n\r\nThird and latest of all in time, though almost contemporary with the\r\nsouthern type, is the central European or Germanic element in our\r\npopulation. Sad as it is to confess it, the truth must nevertheless be\r\ntold, that our beasts and birds, our plants and flowers, are for the\r\nmost part of purely Teutonic origin. Even as the rude and hard-headed\r\nAnglo-Saxon has driven the gentle, poetical, and imaginative Celt ever\r\nwestward before him into the hills and the sea, so the rude and vigorous\r\nGermanic beasts and weeds have driven the gentler and softer southern\r\ntypes into Wales and Cornwall, Galloway and Connemara. It is to the\r\ncentral European population that we owe or owed the red deer, the wild\r\nboar, the bear, the wolf, the beaver, the fox, the badger, the otter,\r\nand the squirrel. It is to the central European flora that we owe the\r\nlarger part of the most familiar plants in all eastern and southeastern\r\nEngland. They crossed in bands over the old land belt before Britain was\r\nfinally insulated, and they have gone on steadily ever since, with true\r\nTeutonic persistence, overrunning the land and pushing slowly westward,\r\nlike all other German bands before or since, to the detriment and\r\ndiscomfort of the previous inhabitants. Let us humbly remember that we\r\nare all of us at bottom foreigners alike, but that it is the Teutonic\r\nEnglish, the people from the old Low Dutch fatherland by the Elbe, who\r\nhave finally given to this isle its name of England, and to every one of\r\nus, Celt or Teuton, their own Teutonic name of Englishmen. We are at\r\nbest, as an irate Teuton once remarked, 'nozzing but segond-hand\r\nChermans.' In the words of a distinguished modern philologist of our own\r\nblood, 'English is Dutch, spoken with a Welsh accent.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHUNDERBOLTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subject of thunderbolts is a very fascinating one, and all the more\r\nso because there are no such things in existence at all as thunderbolts\r\nof any sort. Like the snakes of Iceland, their whole history might, from\r\nthe positive point of view at least, be summed up in the simple\r\nstatement of their utter nonentity. But does that do away in the least,\r\nI should like to know, with their intrinsic interest and importance? Not\r\na bit of it. It only adds to the mystery and charm of the whole subject.\r\nDoes anyone feel as keenly interested in any real living cobra or\r\nanaconda as in the non-existent great sea-serpent? Are ghosts and\r\nvampires less attractive objects of popular study than cats and donkeys?\r\nCan the present King of Abyssinia, interviewed by our own correspondent,\r\nequal the romantic charm of Prester John, or the butcher in the next\r\nstreet rival the personality of Sir Roger Charles Doughty Tichborne,\r\nBaronet? No, the real fact is this: if there _were_ thunderbolts, the\r\nquestion of their nature and action would be a wholly dull, scientific,\r\nand priggish one; it is their unreality alone that invests them with all\r\nthe mysterious weirdness of pure fiction. Lightning, now, is a common\r\nthing that one reads about wearily in the books on electricity, a mere\r\nordinary matter of positive and negative, density and potential, to be\r\nmeasured in ohms (whatever they may be), and partially imitated with\r\nLeyden jars and red sealing-wax apparatus. Why, did not Benjamin\r\nFranklin, a fat old gentleman in ill-fitting small clothes, bring it\r\ndown from the clouds with a simple door-key, somewhere near\r\nPhiladelphia? and does not Mr. Robert Scott (of the Meteorological\r\nOffice) calmly predict its probable occurrence within the next\r\ntwenty-four hours in his daily report, as published regularly in the\r\nmorning papers? This is lightning, mere vulgar lightning, a simple\r\nresult of electrical conditions in the upper atmosphere, inconveniently\r\nconnected with algebraical formulas in _x_, _y_, _z_, with horrid\r\nsymbols interspersed in Greek letters. But the real thunderbolts of\r\nJove, the weapons that the angry Zeus, or Thor, or Indra hurls down upon\r\nthe head of the trembling malefactor--how infinitely grander, more\r\nfearsome, and more mysterious!\r\n\r\nAnd yet even nowadays, I believe, there are a large number of\r\nwell-informed people, who have passed the sixth standard, taken prizes\r\nat the Oxford Local, and attended the dullest lectures of the Society\r\nfor University Extension, but who nevertheless in some vague and dim\r\ncorner of their consciousness retain somehow a lingering faith in the\r\nexistence of thunderbolts. They have not yet grasped in its entirety the\r\nsimple truth that lightning is the reality of which thunderbolts are the\r\nmythical, or fanciful, or verbal representation. We all of us know now\r\nthat lightning is a mere flash of electric light and heat; that it has\r\nno solid existence or core of any sort; in short, that it is dynamical\r\nrather than material, a state or movement rather than a body or thing.\r\nTo be sure, local newspapers still talk with much show of learning about\r\n'the electric fluid' which did such remarkable damage last week upon the\r\nslated steeple of Peddlington Torpida Church; but the well-crammed\r\nschoolboy of the present day has long since learned that the electric\r\nfluid is an exploded fallacy, and that the lightning which pulled the\r\nten slates off the steeple in question was nothing more in its real\r\nnature than a very big immaterial spark. However, the word thunderbolt\r\nhas survived to us from the days when people still believed that the\r\nthing which did the damage during a thunderstorm was really and truly a\r\ngigantic white-hot bolt or arrow; and, as there is a natural tendency in\r\nhuman nature to fit an existence to every word, people even now continue\r\nto imagine that there must be actually something or other somewhere\r\ncalled a thunderbolt. They don't figure this thing to themselves as\r\nbeing identical with the lightning; on the contrary, they seem to regard\r\nit as something infinitely rarer, more terrible, and more mystic; but\r\nthey firmly hold that thunderbolts do exist in real life, and even\r\nsometimes assert that they themselves have positively seen them.\r\n\r\nBut, if seeing is believing, it is equally true, as all who have looked\r\ninto the phenomena of spiritualism and 'psychical research' (modern\r\nEnglish for ghost-hunting) know too well, that believing is seeing also.\r\nThe origin of the faith in thunderbolts must be looked for (like the\r\norigin of the faith in ghosts and 'psychical phenomena') far back in the\r\nhistory of our race. The noble savage, at that early period when wild in\r\nwoods he ran, naturally noticed the existence of thunder and lightning,\r\nbecause thunder and lightning are things that forcibly obtrude\r\nthemselves upon the attention of the observer, however little he may by\r\nnature be scientifically inclined. Indeed, the noble savage, sleeping\r\nnaked on the bare ground, in tropical countries where thunder occurs\r\nalmost every night on an average, was sure to be pretty often awaked\r\nfrom his peaceful slumbers by the torrents of rain that habitually\r\naccompany thunderstorms in the happy realms of everlasting dog-days.\r\nPrimitive man was thereupon compelled to do a little philosophising on\r\nhis own account as to the cause and origin of the rumbling and flashing\r\nwhich he saw so constantly around him. Naturally enough, he concluded\r\nthat the sound must be the voice of somebody; and that the fiery shaft,\r\nwhose effects he sometimes noted upon trees, animals, and his\r\nfellow-man, must be the somebody's arrow. It is immaterial from this\r\npoint of view whether, as the scientific anthropologists hold, he was\r\nled to his conception of these supernatural personages from his prior\r\nbelief in ghosts and spirits, or whether, as Professor Max Müller will\r\nhave it, he felt a deep yearning in his primitive savage breast toward\r\nthe Infinite and the Unknowable (which he would doubtless have spelt,\r\nlike the Professor, with a capital initial, had he been acquainted with\r\nthe intricacies of the yet uninvented alphabet); but this much at least\r\nis pretty certain, that he looked upon the thunder and the lightning as\r\nin some sense the voice and the arrows of an aërial god.\r\n\r\nNow, this idea about the arrows is itself very significant of the mental\r\nattitude of primitive man, and of the way that mental attitude has\r\ncoloured all subsequent thinking and superstition upon this very\r\nsubject. Curiously enough, to the present day the conception of the\r\nthunderbolt is essentially one of a _bolt_--that is to say, an arrow, or\r\nat least an arrowhead. All existing thunderbolts (and there are plenty\r\nof them lying about casually in country houses and local museums) are\r\nmore or less arrow-like in shape and appearance; some of them, indeed,\r\nas we shall see by-and-by, are the actual stone arrowheads of primitive\r\nman himself in person. Of course the noble savage was himself in the\r\nconstant habit of shooting at animals and enemies with a bow and arrow.\r\nWhen, then, he tried to figure to himself the angry god, seated in the\r\nstorm-clouds, who spoke with such a loud rumbling voice, and killed\r\nthose who displeased him with his fiery darts, he naturally thought of\r\nhim as using in his cloudy home the familiar bow and arrow of this\r\nnether planet. To us nowadays, if we were to begin forming the idea for\r\nourselves all over again _de novo_, it would be far more natural to\r\nthink of the thunder as the noise of a big gun, of the lightning as the\r\nflash of the powder, and of the supposed 'bolt' as a shell or bullet.\r\nThere is really a ridiculous resemblance between a thunderstorm and a\r\ndischarge of artillery. But the old conception derived from so many\r\ngenerations of primitive men has held its own against such mere modern\r\ndevices as gunpowder and rifle balls; and none of the objects commonly\r\nshown as thunderbolts are ever round: they are distinguished, whatever\r\ntheir origin, by the common peculiarity that they more or less closely\r\nresemble a dart or arrowhead.\r\n\r\nLet us begin, then, by clearly disembarrassing our minds of any\r\nlingering belief in the existence of thunderbolts. There are absolutely\r\nno such things known to science. The two real phenomena that underlie\r\nthe fable are simply thunder and lightning. A thunderstorm is merely a\r\nseries of electrical discharges between one cloud and another, or\r\nbetween clouds and the earth; and these discharges manifest themselves\r\nto our senses under two forms--to the eye as lightning, to the ear as\r\nthunder. All that passes in each case is a huge spark--a commotion, not\r\na material object. It is in principle just like the spark from an\r\nelectrical machine; but while the most powerful machine of human\r\nconstruction will only send a spark for three feet, the enormous\r\nelectrical apparatus provided for us by nature will send one for four,\r\nfive, or even ten miles. Though lightning when it touches the earth\r\nalways seems to us to come from the clouds to the ground, it is by no\r\nmeans certain that the real course may not at least occasionally be in\r\nthe opposite direction. All we know is that sometimes there is an\r\ninstantaneous discharge between one cloud and another, and sometimes an\r\ninstantaneous discharge between a cloud and the earth.\r\n\r\nBut this idea of a mere passage of highly concentrated energy from one\r\npoint to another was far too abstract, of course, for primitive man, and\r\nis far too abstract even now for nine out of ten of our\r\nfellow-creatures. Those who don't still believe in the bodily\r\nthunderbolt, a fearsome aërial weapon which buries itself deep in the\r\nbosom of the earth, look upon lightning as at least an embodiment of the\r\nelectric fluid, a long spout or line of molten fire, which is usually\r\nconceived of as striking the ground and then proceeding to hide itself\r\nunder the roots of a tree or beneath the foundations of a tottering\r\nhouse. Primitive man naturally took to the grosser and more material\r\nconception. He figured to himself the thunderbolt as a barbed arrowhead;\r\nand the forked zigzag character of the visible flash, as it darts\r\nrapidly from point to point, seemed almost inevitably to suggest to him\r\nthe barbs, as one sees them represented on all the Greek and Roman gems,\r\nin the red right hand of the angry Jupiter.\r\n\r\nThe thunderbolt being thus an accepted fact, it followed naturally that\r\nwhenever any dart-like object of unknown origin was dug up out of the\r\nground, it was at once set down as being a thunderbolt; and, on the\r\nother hand, the frequent occurrence of such dart-like objects, precisely\r\nwhere one might expect to find them in accordance with the theory,\r\nnecessarily strengthened the belief itself. So commonly are thunderbolts\r\npicked up to the present day that to disbelieve in them seems to many\r\ncountry people a piece of ridiculous and stubborn scepticism. Why,\r\nthey've ploughed up dozens of them themselves in their time, and just\r\nabout the very place where the thunderbolt struck the old elm-tree two\r\nyears ago, too.\r\n\r\nThe most favourite form of thunderbolt is the polished stone hatchet or\r\n'celt' of the newer stone age men. I have never heard the very rude\r\nchipped and unpolished axes of the older drift men or cave men described\r\nas thunderbolts: they are too rough and shapeless ever to attract\r\nattention from any except professed archæologists. Indeed, the wicked\r\nhave been known to scoff at them freely as mere accidental lumps of\r\nbroken flint, and to deride the notion of their being due in any way to\r\ndeliberate human handicraft. These are the sort of people who would\r\nregard a grand piano as a fortuitous concourse of atoms. But the shapely\r\nstone hatchet of the later neolithic farmer and herdsman is usually a\r\nbeautifully polished wedge-shaped piece of solid greenstone; and its\r\nedge has been ground to such a delicate smoothness that it seems rather\r\nlike a bit of nature's exquisite workmanship than a simple relic of\r\nprehistoric man. There is something very fascinating about the naïf\r\nbelief that the neolithic axe is a genuine unadulterated thunderbolt.\r\nYou dig it up in the ground exactly where you would expect a thunderbolt\r\n(if there were such things) to be. It is heavy, smooth, well shaped, and\r\nneatly pointed at one end. If it could really descend in a red-hot state\r\nfrom the depths of the sky, launched forth like a cannon-ball by some\r\nfierce discharge of heavenly artillery, it would certainly prove a very\r\nformidable weapon indeed; and one could easily imagine it scoring the\r\nbark of some aged oak, or tearing off the tiles from a projecting\r\nturret, exactly as the lightning is so well known to do in this prosaic\r\nworkaday world of ours. In short, there is really nothing on earth\r\nagainst the theory of the stone axe being a true thunderbolt, except the\r\nfact that it unfortunately happens to be a neolithic hatchet.\r\n\r\nBut the course of reasoning by which we discover the true nature of the\r\nstone axe is not one that would in any case appeal strongly to the\r\nfancy or the intelligence of the British farmer. It is no use telling\r\nhim that whenever one opens a barrow of the stone age one is pretty sure\r\nto find a neolithic axe and a few broken pieces of pottery beside the\r\nmouldering skeleton of the old nameless chief who lies there buried. The\r\nBritish farmer will doubtless stolidly retort that thunderbolts often\r\nstrike the tops of hills, which are just the places where barrows and\r\ntumuli (tumps, he calls them) most do congregate; and that as to the\r\nskeleton, isn't it just as likely that the man was killed by the\r\nthunderbolt as that the thunderbolt was made by a man? Ay, and a sight\r\nlikelier, too.\r\n\r\nAll the world over, this simple and easy belief, that the buried stone\r\naxe is a thunderbolt, exists among Europeans and savages alike. In the\r\nWest of England, the labourers will tell you that the thunder-axes they\r\ndig up fell from the sky. In Brittany, says Mr. Tylor, the old man who\r\nmends umbrellas at Carnac, beside the mysterious stone avenues of that\r\ngreat French Stonehenge, inquires on his rounds for _pierres de\r\ntonnerre_, which of course are found with suspicious frequency in the\r\nimmediate neighbourhood of prehistoric remains. In the Chinese\r\nEncyclopædia we are told that the 'lightning stones' have sometimes the\r\nshape of a hatchet, sometimes that of a knife, and sometimes that of a\r\nmallet. And then, by a curious misapprehension, the sapient author of\r\nthat work goes on to observe that these lightning stones are used by the\r\nwandering Mongols instead of copper and steel. It never seems to have\r\nstruck his celestial intelligence that the Mongols made the lightning\r\nstones instead of digging them up out of the earth. So deeply had the\r\nidea of the thunderbolt buried itself in the recesses of his soul, that\r\nthough a neighbouring people were still actually manufacturing stone\r\naxes almost under his very eyes, he reversed mentally the entire\r\nprocess, and supposed they dug up the thunderbolts which he saw them\r\nusing, and employed them as common hatchets. This is one of the finest\r\ninstances on record of the popular figure which grammarians call the\r\n_hysteron proteron_, and ordinary folk describe as putting the cart\r\nbefore the horse. Just so, while in some parts of Brazil the Indians are\r\nstill laboriously polishing their stone hatchets, in other parts the\r\nplanters are digging up the precisely similar stone hatchets of earlier\r\ngenerations, and religiously preserving them in their houses as\r\nundoubted thunderbolts. I have myself had pressed upon my attention as\r\ngenuine lightning stones, in the West Indies, the exquisitely polished\r\ngreenstone tomahawks of the old Carib marauders. But then, in this\r\nmatter, I am pretty much in the position of that philosophic sceptic\r\nwho, when he was asked by a lady whether he believed in ghosts, answered\r\nwisely, 'No, madam, I have seen by far too many of them.'\r\n\r\nOne of the finest accounts ever given of the nature of thunderbolts is\r\nthat mentioned by Adrianus Tollius in his edition of 'Boethius on Gems.'\r\nHe gives illustrations of some neolithic axes and hammers, and then\r\nproceeds to state that in the opinion of philosophers they are generated\r\nin the sky by a fulgureous exhalation (whatever that may look like)\r\nconglobed in a cloud by a circumfixed humour, and baked hard, as it\r\nwere, by intense heat. The weapon, it seems, then becomes pointed by the\r\ndamp mixed with it flying from the dry part, and leaving the other end\r\ndenser; while the exhalations press it so hard that it breaks out\r\nthrough the cloud, and makes thunder and lightning. A very lucid\r\nexplanation certainly, but rendered a little difficult of apprehension\r\nby the effort necessary for realising in a mental picture the\r\nconglobation of a fulgureous exhalation by a circumfixed humour.\r\n\r\nOne would like to see a drawing of the process, though the sketch would\r\nprobably much resemble the picture of a muchness, so admirably described\r\nby the mock turtle. The excellent Tollius himself, however, while\r\ndemurring on the whole to this hypothesis of the philosophers, bases his\r\nobjection mainly on the ground that, if this were so, then it is odd the\r\nthunderbolts are not round, but wedge-shaped, and that they have holes\r\nin them, and those holes not equal throughout, but widest at the ends.\r\nAs a matter of fact, Tollius has here hit the right nail on the head\r\nquite accidentally; for the holes are really there, of course, to\r\nreceive the haft of the axe or hammer. But if they were truly\r\nthunderbolts, and if the bolts were shafted, then the holes would have\r\nbeen lengthwise, as in an arrowhead, not crosswise, as in an axe or\r\nhammer. Which is a complete _reductio ad absurdum_ of the philosophic\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nSome of the cerauniæ, says Pliny, are like hatchets. He would have been\r\nnearer the mark if he had said 'are hatchets' outright. But this\r\n_aperçu_, which was to Pliny merely a stray suggestion, became to the\r\nnorthern peoples a firm article of belief, and caused them to represent\r\nto themselves their god Thor or Thunor as armed, not with a bolt, but\r\nwith an axe or hammer. Etymologically Thor, Thunor, and thunder are the\r\nself-same word; but while the southern races looked upon Zeus or Indra\r\nas wielding his forked darts in his red right hand, the northern races\r\nlooked upon the Thunder-god as hurling down an angry hammer from his\r\nseat in the clouds. There can be but little doubt that the very notion\r\nof Thor's hammer itself was derived from the shape of the supposed\r\nthunderbolt, which the Scandinavians and Teutons rightly saw at once to\r\nbe an axe or mallet, not an arrowhead. The 'fiery axe' of Thunor is a\r\ncommon metaphor in Anglo-Saxon poetry. Thus, Thor's hammer is itself\r\nmerely the picture which our northern ancestors formed to themselves,\r\nby compounding the idea of thunder and lightning with the idea of the\r\npolished stone hatchets they dug up among the fields and meadows.\r\n\r\nFlint arrowheads of the stone age are less often taken for thunderbolts,\r\nno doubt because they are so much smaller that they look quite too\r\ninsignificant for the weapons of an angry god. They are more frequently\r\ndescribed as fairy-darts or fairy-bolts. Still, I have known even\r\narrowheads regarded as thunderbolts, and preserved superstitiously\r\nunder that belief. In Finland, stone arrows are universally so viewed;\r\nand the rainbow is looked upon as the bow of Tiermes, the thunder-god,\r\nwho shoots with it the guilty sorcerers.\r\n\r\nBut why should thunderbolts, whether stone axes or flint arrowheads, be\r\npreserved, not merely as curiosities, but from motives of superstition?\r\nThe reason is a simple one. Everybody knows that in all magical\r\nceremonies it is necessary to have something belonging to the person you\r\nwish to conjure against, in order to make your spells effectual. A bone,\r\nbe it but a joint of the little finger, is sufficient to raise the ghost\r\nto which it once belonged; cuttings of hair or clippings of nails are\r\nenough to put their owner magically in your power; and that is the\r\nreason why, if you are a prudent person, you will always burn all such\r\noff-castings of your body, lest haply an enemy should get hold of them,\r\nand cast the evil eye upon you with their potent aid. In the same way,\r\nif you can lay hands upon anything that once belonged to an elf, such as\r\na fairy-bolt or flint arrowhead, you can get its former possessor to do\r\nanything you wish by simply rubbing it and calling upon him to appear.\r\nThis is the secret of half the charms and amulets in existence, most of\r\nwhich are either real old arrowheads, or carnelians cut in the same\r\nshape, which has now mostly degenerated from the barb to the\r\nconventional heart, and been mistakenly associated with the idea of\r\nlove. This is the secret, too, of all the rings, lamps, gems, and boxes,\r\npossession of which gives a man power over fairies, spirits, gnomes, and\r\ngenii. All magic proceeds upon the prime belief that you must possess\r\nsomething belonging to the person you wish to control, constrain, or\r\ninjure. And, failing anything else, you must at least have a wax image\r\nof him, which you call by his name, and use as his substitute in your\r\nincantations.\r\n\r\nOn this primitive principle, possession of a thunderbolt gives you some\r\nsort of hold, as it were, over the thunder-god himself in person. If you\r\nkeep a thunderbolt in your house it will never be struck by lightning.\r\nIn Shetland, stone axes are religiously preserved in every cottage as a\r\ncheap and simple substitute for lightning-rods. In Cornwall, the stone\r\nhatchets and arrowheads not only guard the house from thunder, but also\r\nact as magical barometers, changing colour with the changes of the\r\nweather, as if in sympathy with the temper of the thunder-god. In\r\nGermany, the house where a thunderbolt is kept is safe from the storm;\r\nand the bolt itself begins to sweat on the approach of lightning-clouds.\r\nNay, so potent is the protection afforded by a thunderbolt that where\r\nthe lightning has once struck it never strikes again; the bolt already\r\nburied in the soil seems to preserve the surrounding place from the\r\nanger of the deity. Old and pagan in their nature as are these beliefs,\r\nthey yet survive so thoroughly into Christian times that I have seen a\r\nstone hatchet built into the steeple of a church to protect it from\r\nlightning. Indeed, steeples have always of course attracted the electric\r\ndischarge to a singular degree by their height and tapering form,\r\nespecially before the introduction of lighting-rods; and it was a sore\r\ntrial of faith to mediæval reasoners to understand why heaven should\r\nhurl its angry darts so often against the towers of its very own\r\nchurches. In the Abruzzi the flint axe has actually been Christianised\r\ninto St. Paul's arrows--_saetti de San Paolo_. Families hand down the\r\nmiraculous stones from father to son as a precious legacy; and mothers\r\nhang them on their children's necks side by side with medals of saints\r\nand madonnas, which themselves are hardly so highly prized as the stones\r\nthat fall from heaven.\r\n\r\nAnother and very different form of thunderbolt is the belemnite, a\r\ncommon English fossil often preserved in houses in the west country with\r\nthe same superstitious reverence as the neolithic hatchets. The very\r\nform of the belemnite at once suggests the notion of a dart or\r\nlance-head, which has gained for it its scientific name. At the present\r\nday, when all our girls go to Girton and enter for the classical tripos,\r\nI need hardly translate the word belemnite 'for the benefit of the\r\nladies,' as people used to do in the dark and unemancipated eighteenth\r\ncentury; but as our boys have left off learning Greek just as their\r\nsisters are beginning to act the 'Antigone' at private theatricals, I\r\nmay perhaps be pardoned if I explain, 'for the benefit of the\r\ngentlemen,' that the word is practically equivalent to javelin-fossil.\r\nThe belemnites are the internal shells of a sort of cuttle-fish which\r\nswam about in enormous numbers in the seas whose sediment forms our\r\nmodern lias, oolite, and gault. A great many different species are known\r\nand have acquired charming names in very doubtful Attic at the hands of\r\nprofoundly learned geological investigators, but almost all are equally\r\ngood representatives of the mythical thunderbolt. The finest specimens\r\nare long, thick, cylindrical, and gradually tapering, with a hole at one\r\nend as if on purpose to receive the shaft. Sometimes they have\r\npetrified into iron pyrites or copper compounds, shining like gold, and\r\nthen they make very noble thunderbolts indeed, heavy as lead, and\r\ncapable of doing profound mischief if properly directed. At other times\r\nthey have crystallised in transparent spar, and then they form very\r\nbeautiful objects, as smooth and polished as the best lapidary could\r\npossibly make them. Belemnites are generally found in immense numbers\r\ntogether, especially in the marlstone quarries of the Midlands, and in\r\nthe lias cliffs of Dorsetshire. Yet the quarrymen who find them never\r\nseem to have their faith shaken in the least by the enormous quantities\r\nof thunderbolts that would appear to have struck a single spot with such\r\nextraordinary frequency This little fact also tells rather hardly\r\nagainst the theory that the lightning never falls twice upon the same\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nOnly the largest and heaviest belemnites are known as thunder stones;\r\nthe smaller ones are more commonly described as agate pencils. In\r\nShakespeare's country their connection with thunder is well known, so\r\nthat in all probability a belemnite is the original of the beautiful\r\nlines in 'Cymbeline':--\r\n\r\n    Fear no more the lightning flash,\r\n    Nor the all-dreaded thunder stone,\r\n\r\nwhere the distinction between the lightning and the thunderbolt is\r\nparticularly well indicated. In every part of Europe belemnites and\r\nstone hatchets are alike regarded as thunderbolts; so that we have the\r\ncurious result that people confuse under a single name a natural fossil\r\nof immense antiquity and a human product of comparatively recent but\r\nstill prehistoric date. Indeed, I have had two thunderbolts shown me at\r\nonce, one of which was a large belemnite, and the other a modern Indian\r\ntomahawk. Curiously enough, English sailors still call the nearest\r\nsurviving relatives of the belemnites, the squids or calamaries of the\r\nAtlantic, by the appropriate name of sea-arrows.\r\n\r\nMany other natural or artificial objects have added their tittle to the\r\nbelief in thunderbolts. In the Himalayas, for example, where awful\r\nthunderstorms are always occurring as common objects of the country, the\r\ntorrents which follow them tear out of the loose soil fossil bones and\r\ntusks and teeth, which are universally looked upon as lightning-stones.\r\nThe nodules of pyrites, often picked up on beaches, with their false\r\nappearance of having been melted by intense heat, pass muster easily\r\nwith children and sailor folk for the genuine thunderbolts. But the\r\ngrand upholder of the belief, the one true undeniable reality which has\r\nkept alive the thunderbolt even in a wicked and sceptical age, is,\r\nbeyond all question, the occasional falling of meteoric stones. Your\r\nmeteor is an incontrovertible fact; there is no getting over him; in the\r\nBritish Museum itself you will find him duly classified and labelled and\r\ncatalogued. Here, surely, we have the ultimate substratum of the\r\nthunderbolt myth. To be sure, meteors have no kind of natural connection\r\nwith thunderstorms; they may fall anywhere and at any time; but to\r\nobject thus is to be hypercritical. A stone that falls from heaven, no\r\nmatter how or when, is quite good enough to be considered as a\r\nthunderbolt.\r\n\r\nMeteors, indeed, might very easily be confounded with lightning,\r\nespecially by people who already have the full-blown conception of a\r\nthunderbolt floating about vaguely in their brains. The meteor leaps\r\nupon the earth suddenly with a rushing noise; it is usually red-hot when\r\nit falls, by friction against the air; it is mostly composed of native\r\niron and other heavy metallic bodies; and it does its best to bury\r\nitself in the ground in the most orthodox and respectable manner. The\r\nman who sees this parlous monster come whizzing through the clouds from\r\nplanetary space, making a fiery track like a great dragon as it moves\r\nrapidly across the sky, and finally ploughing its way into the earth in\r\nhis own back garden, may well be excused for regarding it as a fine\r\nspecimen of the true antique thunderbolt. The same virtues which belong\r\nto the buried stone are in some other places claimed for meteoric iron,\r\nsmall pieces of which are worn as charms, specially useful in protecting\r\nthe wearer against thunder, lightning, and evil incantations. In many\r\ncases miraculous images have been hewn out of the stones that have\r\nfallen from heaven; and in others the meteorite itself is carefully\r\npreserved or worshipped as the actual representative of god or goddess,\r\nsaint or madonna. The image that fell down from Jupiter may itself have\r\nbeen a mass of meteoric iron.\r\n\r\nBoth meteorites and stone hatchets, as well as all other forms of\r\nthunderbolt, are in excellent repute as amulets, not only against\r\nlightning, but against the evil eye generally. In Italy they protect the\r\nowner from thunder, epidemics, and cattle disease, the last two of which\r\nare well known to be caused by witchcraft; while Prospero in the\r\n'Tempest' is a surviving proof how thunderstorms, too, can be magically\r\nproduced. The tongues of sheep-bells ought to be made of meteoric iron\r\nor of elf-bolts, in order to insure the animals against foot-and-mouth\r\ndisease or death by storm. Built into walls or placed on the threshold\r\nof stables, thunderbolts are capital preventives of fire or other\r\ndamage, though not perhaps in this respect quite equal to a rusty\r\nhorseshoe from a prehistoric battlefield. Thrown into a well they purify\r\nthe water; and boiled in the drink of diseased sheep they render a cure\r\npositively certain. In Cornwall thunderbolts are a sovereign remedy for\r\nrheumatism; and in the popular pharmacopoeia of Ireland they have\r\nbeen employed with success for ophthalmia, pleurisy, and many other\r\npainful diseases. If finely powdered and swallowed piecemeal, they\r\nrender the person who swallows them invulnerable for the rest of his\r\nlifetime. But they cannot conscientiously be recommended for dyspepsia\r\nand other forms of indigestion.\r\n\r\nAs if on purpose to confuse our already very vague ideas about\r\nthunderbolts, there is one special kind of lightning which really seems\r\nintentionally to simulate a meteorite, and that is the kind known as\r\nfire-balls or (more scientifically) globular lightning. A fire-ball\r\ngenerally appears as a sphere of light, sometimes only as big as a Dutch\r\ncheese, sometimes as large as three feet in diameter. It moves along\r\nvery slowly and demurely through the air, remaining visible for a whole\r\nminute or two together; and in the end it generally bursts up with great\r\nviolence, as if it were a London railway station being experimented upon\r\nby Irish patriots. At Milan one day a fire-ball of this description\r\nwalked down one of the streets so slowly that a small crowd walked after\r\nit admiringly, to see where it was going. It made straight for a church\r\nsteeple, after the common but sacrilegious fashion of all lightning,\r\nstruck the gilded cross on the topmost pinnacle, and then immediately\r\nvanished, like a Virgilian apparition, into thin air.\r\n\r\nA few years ago, too, Dr. Tripe was watching a very severe thunderstorm,\r\nwhen he saw a fire-ball come quietly gliding up to him, apparently\r\nrising from the earth rather than falling towards it. Instead of running\r\naway, like a practical man, the intrepid doctor held his ground quietly\r\nand observed the fiery monster with scientific nonchalance. After\r\ncontinuing its course for some time in a peaceful and regular fashion,\r\nhowever, without attempting to assault him, it finally darted off at a\r\ntangent in another direction, and turned apparently into forked\r\nlightning. A fire-ball, noticed among the Glendowan Mountains in\r\nDonegal, behaved even more eccentrically, as might be expected from its\r\nIrish antecedents. It first skirted the earth in a leisurely way for\r\nseveral hundred yards like a cannon-ball; then it struck the ground,\r\nricochetted, and once more bounded along for another short spell; after\r\nwhich it disappeared in the boggy soil, as if it were completely\r\nfinished and done for. But in another moment it rose again, nothing\r\ndaunted, with Celtic irrepressibility, several yards away, pursued its\r\nghostly course across a running stream (which shows, at least, there\r\ncould have been no witchcraft in it), and finally ran to earth for good\r\nin the opposite bank, leaving a round hole in the sloping peat at the\r\nspot where it buried itself. Where it first struck, it cut up the peat\r\nas if with a knife, and made a broad deep trench which remained\r\nafterwards as a witness of its eccentric conduct. If the person who\r\nobserved it had been of a superstitious turn of mind we should have had\r\nhere one of the finest and most terrifying ghost stories on the entire\r\nrecord, which would have made an exceptionally splendid show in the\r\n'Transactions of the Society for Psychical Research.' Unfortunately,\r\nhowever, he was only a man of science, ungifted with the precious dower\r\nof poetical imagination; so he stupidly called it a remarkable\r\nfire-ball, measured the ground carefully like a common engineer, and\r\nsent an account of the phenomenon to that far more prosaic periodical,\r\nthe 'Quarterly Journal of the Meteorological Society.' Another splendid\r\napparition thrown away recklessly, for ever!\r\n\r\nThere is a curious form of electrical discharge, somewhat similar to the\r\nfire-ball but on a smaller scale, which may be regarded as the exact\r\nopposite of the thunderbolt, inasmuch as it is always quite harmless.\r\nThis is St. Elmo's fire, a brush of lambent light, which plays around\r\nthe masts of ships and the tops of trees, when clouds are low and\r\ntension great. It is, in fact, the equivalent in nature of the brush\r\ndischarge from an electric machine. The Greeks and Romans looked upon\r\nthis lambent display as a sign of the presence of Castor and Pollux,\r\n'fratres Helenæ, lucida sidera,' and held that its appearance was an\r\nomen of safety, as everybody who has read the 'Lays of Ancient Rome'\r\nmust surely remember. The modern name, St. Elmo's fire, is itself a\r\ncuriously twisted and perversely Christianised reminiscence of the great\r\ntwin brethren; for St. Elmo is merely a corruption of Helena, made\r\nmasculine and canonised by the grateful sailors. It was as Helen's\r\nbrothers that they best knew the Dioscuri in the good old days of the\r\nupper empire; and when the new religion forbade them any longer to\r\nworship those vain heathen deities, they managed to hand over the flames\r\nat the masthead to an imaginary St. Elmo, whose protection stood them in\r\njust as good stead as that of the original alternate immortals.\r\n\r\nFinally, the effects of lightning itself are sometimes such as to\r\nproduce upon the mind of an impartial but unscientific beholder the firm\r\nidea that a bodily thunderbolt must necessarily have descended from\r\nheaven. In sand or rock, where lightning has struck, it often forms long\r\nhollow tubes, known to the calmly discriminating geological intelligence\r\nas fulgurites, and looking for all the world like gigantic drills such\r\nas quarrymen make for putting in a blast. They are produced, of course,\r\nby the melting of the rock under the terrific heat of the electric\r\nspark; and they grow narrower and narrower as they descend till they\r\nfinally disappear. But to a casual observer, they irresistibly suggest\r\nthe notion that a material weapon has struck the ground, and buried\r\nitself at the bottom of the hole. The summit of Little Ararat, that\r\nweather-beaten and many-fabled peak (where an enterprising journalist\r\nnot long ago discovered the remains of Noah's Ark), has been riddled\r\nthrough and through by frequent lightnings, till the rock is now a mere\r\nhoneycombed mass of drills and tubes, like an old target at the end of a\r\nlong day's constant rifle practice. Pieces of the red trachyte from the\r\nsummit, a foot long, have been brought to Europe, perforated all over\r\nwith these natural bullet marks, each of them lined with black glass,\r\ndue to the fusion of the rock by the passage of the spark. Specimens of\r\nsuch thunder-drilled rock may be seen in most geological museums. On\r\nsome which Humboldt collected from a peak in Mexico, the fused slag from\r\nthe wall of the tube has overflowed on to the surrounding surface, thus\r\nconclusively proving (if proof were necessary) that the holes are due to\r\nmelting heat alone, and not to the passage of any solid thunderbolt.\r\n\r\nBut it was the introduction and general employment of lightning-rods\r\nthat dealt a final deathblow to the thunderbolt theory. A\r\nlightning-conductor consists essentially of a long piece of metal,\r\npointed at the end whose business it is, not so much (as most people\r\nimagine) to carry off the flash of lightning harmlessly, should it\r\nhappen to strike the house to which the conductor is attached, but\r\nrather to prevent the occurrence of a flash at all, by gradually and\r\ngently drawing off the electricity as fast as it gathers before it has\r\nhad time to collect in sufficient force for a destructive discharge. It\r\nresembles in effect an overflow pipe which drains off the surplus water\r\nof a pond as soon as it runs in, in such a manner as to prevent the\r\npossibility of an inundation, which might occur if the water were\r\nallowed to collect in force behind a dam or embankment. It is a\r\nflood-gate, not a moat: it carries away the electricity of the air\r\nquietly to the ground, without allowing it to gather in sufficient\r\namount to produce a flash of lightning. It might thus be better called\r\na lightning-preventer than a lightning-conductor: it conducts\r\nelectricity, but it prevents lightning. At first, all lightning-rods\r\nused to be made with knobs on the top, and then the electricity used to\r\ncollect at the surface until the electric force was sufficient to cause\r\na spark. In those happy days, you had the pleasure of seeing that the\r\nlightning was actually being drawn off from your neighbourhood\r\npiecemeal. Knobs, it was held, must be the best things, because you\r\ncould incontestably see the sparks striking them with your own eyes. But\r\nas time went on, electricians discovered that if you fixed a fine metal\r\npoint to the conductor of an electric machine it was impossible to get\r\nup any appreciable charge because the electricity kept always leaking\r\nout by means of the point. Then it was seen that if you made your\r\nlightning-rods pointed at the end, you would be able in the same way to\r\ndissipate your electricity before it ever had time to come to a head in\r\nthe shape of lightning. From that moment the thunderbolt was safely dead\r\nand buried. It was urged, indeed, that the attempt thus to rob Heaven of\r\nits thunders was wicked and impious; but the common-sense of mankind\r\nrefused to believe that absolute omnipotence could be sensibly defied by\r\ntwenty yards of cylindrical iron tubing. Thenceforth the thunderbolt\r\nceased to exist, save in poetry, country houses, and the most rural\r\ncircles; even the electric fluid was generally relegated to the\r\nprovincial press, where it still keeps company harmoniously with\r\ncaloric, the devouring element, nature's abhorrence of a vacuum, and\r\nmany other like philosophical fossils: while lightning itself, shorn of\r\nits former glories, could no longer wage impious war against cathedral\r\ntowers, but was compelled to restrict itself to blasting a solitary\r\nrider now and again in the open fields, or drilling more holes in the\r\nalready crumbling summit of Mount Ararat. Yet it will be a thousand\r\nyears more, in all probability, before the last thunderbolt ceases to be\r\nshown as a curiosity here and there to marvelling visitors, and takes\r\nits proper place in some village museum as a belemnite, a meteoric\r\nstone, or a polished axe-head of our neolithic ancestors. Even then, no\r\ndoubt, the original bolt will still survive as a recognised property in\r\nthe stock-in-trade of every well-equipped poet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHONEY-DEW\r\n\r\n\r\nPlace, the garden. Time, summer. Dramatis personæ, a couple of small\r\nbrown garden-ants, and a lazy clustering colony of wee green\r\n'plant-lice,' or 'blight,' or aphides. The exact scene is usually on the\r\nyoung and succulent branches of a luxuriant rose-bush, into whose soft\r\nshoots the aphides have deeply buried their long trunk-like snouts, in\r\nsearch of the sap off which they live so contentedly through their brief\r\nlifetime. To them, enter the two small brown ants, their lawful\r\npossessors; for ants, too, though absolutely unrecognised by English law\r\n('de minimis non curat lex,' says the legal aphorism), are nevertheless\r\nin their own commonwealth duly seised of many and various goods and\r\nchattels; and these same aphides, as everybody has heard, stand to them\r\nin pretty much the same position as cows stand to human herdsmen. Throw\r\nin for sole spectator a loitering naturalist, and you get the entire\r\n_mise-en-scène_ of a quaint little drama that works itself out a dozen\r\ntimes among the wilted rose-trees beneath the latticed cottage windows\r\nevery summer morning.\r\n\r\nIt is a delightful sight to watch the two little lilliputian proprietors\r\napproaching and milking these their wee green motionless cattle. First\r\nof all, the ants quickly scent their way with protruded antennæ (for\r\nthey are as good as blind, poor things!) up the prickly stem of the\r\nrose-bush, guided, no doubt, by the faint perfume exhaled from the\r\nnectar above them. Smelling their road cautiously to the ends of the\r\nbranches, they soon reach their own particular aphides, whose bodies\r\nthey proceed gently to stroke with their outstretched feelers, and then\r\nstand by quietly for a moment in happy anticipation of the coming\r\ndinner. Presently, the obedient aphis, conscious of its lawful master's\r\nfriendly presence, begins slowly to emit from two long horn-like tubes\r\nnear the centre of its back a couple of limpid drops of a sticky pale\r\nyellow fluid. Honey-dew our English rustics still call it, because, when\r\nthe aphides are not milked often enough by ants, they discharge it\r\nawkwardly of their own accord, and then it falls as a sweet clammy dew\r\nupon the grass beneath them. The ant, approaching the two tubes with\r\ncautious tenderness, removes the sweet drops without injuring in any way\r\nhis little _protégé_, and then passes on to the next in order of his\r\ntiny cattle, leaving the aphis apparently as much relieved by the\r\nprocess as a cow with a full hanging udder is relieved by the timely\r\nattention of the human milkmaid.\r\n\r\nEvidently, this is a case of mutual accommodation in the political\r\neconomy of the ants and aphides: a free interchange of services between\r\nthe ant as consumer and the aphis as producer. Why the aphides should\r\nhave acquired the curious necessity for getting rid of this sweet,\r\nsticky, and nutritious secretion nobody knows with certainty; but it is\r\nat least quite clear that the liquid is a considerable nuisance to them\r\nin their very sedentary and monotonous existence--a waste product of\r\nwhich they are anxious to disembarrass themselves as easily as\r\npossible--and that while they themselves stand to the ants in the\r\nrelation of purveyors of food supply, the ants in return stand to them\r\nin the relation of scavengers, or contractors for the removal of useless\r\naccumulations.\r\n\r\nEverybody knows the aphides well by sight, in one of their forms at\r\nleast, the familiar rose aphis; but probably few people ever look at\r\nthem closely and critically enough to observe how very beautiful and\r\nwonderful is the organisation of their tiny limbs in all its exquisite\r\ndetail. If you pick off one good-sized wingless insect, however, from a\r\nblighted rose-leaf, and put him on a glass slide under a low power of\r\nthe microscope, you will most likely be quite surprised to find what a\r\nlovely little creature it is that you have been poisoning wholesale all\r\nyour life long with diluted tobacco-juice. His body is so transparent\r\nthat you can see through it by transmitted light: a dainty glass globe,\r\nyou would say, of emerald green, set upon six tapering, jointed, hairy\r\nlegs, and provided in front with two large black eyes of many facets,\r\nand a pair of long and very flexible antennæ, easily moved in any\r\ndirection, but usually bent backward when the creature is at rest so as\r\nto reach nearly to his tail as he stands at ease upon his native\r\nrose-leaf. There are, however, two other features about him which\r\nspecially attract attention, as being very characteristic of the aphides\r\nand their allies among all other insects. In the first place, his mouth\r\nis provided with a very long snout or proboscis, classically described\r\nas a rostrum, with which he pierces the outer skin of the rose-shoot\r\nwhere he lives, and sucks up incessantly its sweet juices. This organ is\r\ncommon to the aphis with all the other bugs and plant-lice. In the\r\nsecond place, he has half-way down his back (or a little more) a pair of\r\nvery peculiar hollow organs, the honey tubes, from which exudes that\r\nsingular secretion, the honey-dew. These tubes are not found in quite\r\nall species of aphides, but they are very common among the class, and\r\nthey form by far the most conspicuous and interesting organs in all\r\nthose aphides which do possess them.\r\n\r\nThe life-history of the rose-aphis, small and familiar as is the insect\r\nitself, forms one of the most marvellous and extraordinary chapters in\r\nall the fairy tales of modern science. Nobody need wonder why the blight\r\nattacks his roses so persistently when once he has learnt the unusual\r\nprovision for exceptional fertility in the reproduction of these insect\r\nplagues. The whole story is too long to give at full length, but here is\r\na brief recapitulation of a year's generations of common aphides.\r\n\r\nIn the spring, the eggs of last year's crop, which have been laid by the\r\nmothers in nooks and crannies out of reach of the frost, are quickened\r\ninto life by the first return of warm weather, and hatch out their brood\r\nof insects. All this brood consists of imperfect females, without a\r\nsingle male among them; and they all fasten at once upon the young buds\r\nof their native bush, where they pass a sluggish and uneventful\r\nexistence in sucking up the juice from the veins on the one hand, and\r\nsecreting honey-dew upon the other. Four times they moult their skins,\r\nthese moults being in some respects analogous to the metamorphosis of\r\nthe caterpillar into chrysalis and butterfly. After the fourth moult,\r\nthe young aphides attain maturity; and then they give origin,\r\nparthenogenetically, to a second brood, also of imperfect females, all\r\nproduced without any fathers. This second brood brings forth in like\r\nmanner a third generation, asexual, as before; and the same process is\r\nrepeated without intermission as long as the warm weather lasts. In each\r\ncase, the young simply bud out from the ovaries of the mothers, exactly\r\nas new crops of leaves bud out from the rose-branch on which they grow.\r\nEleven generations have thus been observed to follow one another rapidly\r\nin a single summer; and indeed, by keeping the aphides in a warm room,\r\none may even make them continue their reproduction in this purely\r\nvegetative fashion for as many as four years running. But as soon as\r\nthe cold weather begins to set in, perfect male and female insects are\r\nproduced by the last swarm of parthenogenetic mothers; and these true\r\nfemales, after being fertilised, lay the eggs which remain through the\r\nwinter, and from which the next summer's broods have to begin afresh the\r\nwonderful cycle. Thus, only one generation of aphides, out of ten or\r\neleven, consists of true males and females: all the rest are false\r\nfemales, producing young by a process of budding.\r\n\r\nSetting aside for the present certain special modifications of this\r\nstrange cycle which have been lately described by M. Jules Lichtenstein,\r\nlet us consider for a moment what can be the origin and meaning of such\r\nan unusual and curious mode of reproduction.\r\n\r\nThe aphides are on the whole the most purely inactive and vegetative of\r\nall insects, unless indeed we except a few very debased and degraded\r\nparasites. They fasten themselves early in life on to a particular shoot\r\nof a particular plant; they drink in its juices, digest them, grow, and\r\nundergo their incomplete metamorphoses; they produce new generations\r\nwith extraordinary rapidity; and they vegetate, in fact, almost as much\r\nas the plant itself upon which they are living. Their existence is\r\nduller than that of the very dullest cathedral city. They are thus\r\nessentially degenerate creatures: they have found the conditions of life\r\ntoo easy for them, and they have reverted to something so low and simple\r\nthat they are almost plant-like in some of their habits and\r\npeculiarities.\r\n\r\nThe ancestors of the aphides were free winged insects; and, in certain\r\nstages of their existence, most living species of aphides possess at\r\nleast some winged members. On the rose-bush, you can generally pick off\r\na few such larger winged forms, side by side with the wee green wingless\r\ninsects. But creatures which have taken to passing most of their life\r\nupon a single spot on a single plant hardly need the luxury of wings;\r\nand so, in nine cases out of ten, natural selection has dispensed with\r\nthose needless encumbrances. Even the legs are comparatively little\r\nwanted by our modern aphides, which only require them to walk away in a\r\nstately sleepy manner when rudely disturbed by man, lady-birds, or other\r\nenemies; and indeed the legs are now very weak and feeble, and incapable\r\nof walking for more than a short distance at a time under exceptional\r\nprovocation. The eyes remain, it is true; but only the big ones: the\r\nlittle ocelli at the top of the head, found amongst so many of their\r\nallies, are quite wanting in all the aphides. In short, the plant-lice\r\nhave degenerated into mere mouths and sacks for sucking and storing food\r\nfrom the tissues of plants, provided with large honey-tubes for getting\r\nrid of the waste sugar.\r\n\r\nNow, the greater the amount of food any animal gets, and the less the\r\namount of expenditure it performs in muscular action, the greater will\r\nbe the surplus it has left over for the purposes of reproduction. Eggs\r\nor young, in fact, represent the amount thus left over after all the\r\nwants of the body have been provided for. But in the rose-aphis the\r\nwants of the body, when once the insect has reached its full growth, are\r\nabsolutely nothing; and it therefore then begins to bud out new\r\ngenerations in rapid succession as fast as ever it can produce them.\r\nThis is strictly analogous to what we see every day taking place in all\r\nthe plants around us. New leaves are produced one after another, as fast\r\nas material can be supplied for their nutrition, and each of these new\r\nleaves is known to be a separate individual, just as much as the\r\nindividual aphis. At last, however, a time comes when the reproductive\r\npower of the plant begins to fail, and then it produces flowers, that is\r\nto say stamens (male) and pistils (female), whose union results in\r\nfertilisation and the subsequent outgrowth of fruit and seeds. Thus a\r\nyear's cycle of the plant-lice exactly answers to the life-history of an\r\nordinary annual. The eggs correspond to the seeds; the various\r\ngenerations of aphides budding out from one another by parthenogenesis\r\ncorrespond to the leaves budded out by one another throughout the\r\nsummer; and the final brood of perfect males and females answers to the\r\nflower with its stamen and pistils, producing the seeds, as they produce\r\nthe eggs, for setting up afresh the next year's cycle.\r\n\r\nThis consideration, I fancy, suggests to us the most probable\r\nexplanation of the honey-tubes and honey-dew. Creatures that eat so much\r\nand reproduce so fast as the aphides are rapidly sucking up juices all\r\nthe time from the plant on which they fasten, and converting most of the\r\nnutriment so absorbed into material for fresh generations. That is how\r\nthey swarm so fast over all our shrubs and flowers. But if there is any\r\none kind of material in their food in excess of their needs, they would\r\nnaturally have to secrete it by a special organ developed or enlarged\r\nfor the purpose. I don't mean that the organ would or could be developed\r\nall at once, by a sudden effort, but that as the habit of fixing\r\nthemselves upon plants and sucking their juices grew from generation to\r\ngeneration with these descendants of originally winged insects, an organ\r\nfor permitting the waste product to exude must necessarily have grown\r\nside by side with it. Sugar seems to have been such a waste product,\r\ncontained in the juices of the plant to an extent beyond what the\r\naphides could assimilate or use up in the production of new broods; and\r\nthis sugar is therefore secreted by special organs, the honey-tubes. One\r\ncan readily imagine that it may at first have escaped in small\r\nquantities, and that two pores on their last segment but two may have\r\nbeen gradually specialised into regular secreting organs, perhaps under\r\nthe peculiar agency of the ants, who have regularly appropriated so many\r\nkinds of aphides as miniature milch cows.\r\n\r\nSo completely have some species of ants come to recognise their own\r\nproprietary interest in the persons of the aphides, that they provide\r\nthem with fences and cow-sheds on the most approved human pattern.\r\nSometimes they build up covered galleries to protect their tiny cattle;\r\nand these galleries lead from the nest to the place where the aphides\r\nare fixed, and completely enclose the little creatures from all chance\r\nof harm. If intruders try to attack the farmyard, the ants drive them\r\naway by biting and lacerating them. Sir John Lubbock, who has paid great\r\nattention to the mutual relations of ants and aphides, has even shown\r\nthat various kinds of ants domesticate various species of aphis. The\r\ncommon brown garden-ant, one of the darkest skinned among our English\r\nraces, 'devotes itself principally to aphides which frequent twigs and\r\nleaves'; especially, so far as I have myself observed, the bright green\r\naphis of the rose, and the closely allied little black aphis of the\r\nbroad bean. On the other hand a nearly related reddish ant pays\r\nattention chiefly to those aphides which live on the bark of trees,\r\nwhile the yellow meadow-ants, a far more subterranean species, keep\r\nflocks and herds of the like-minded aphides which feed upon the roots of\r\nherbs and grasses.\r\n\r\nSir John Lubbock, indeed, even suggests--and how the suggestion would\r\nhave charmed 'Civilisation' Buckle!--that to this difference of food and\r\nhabit the distinctive colours of the various species may very probably\r\nbe due. The ground which he adduces for this ingenious idea is a capital\r\nexample of the excellent use to which out-of-the-way evidence may be\r\ncleverly put by a competent evolutionary thinker. 'The Baltic amber,' he\r\nsays, 'contains among the remains of many other insects a species of\r\nant intermediate between our small brown garden-ants and the little\r\nyellow meadow-ants. This is possibly the stock from which these and\r\nother allied species are descended. One is tempted to suggest that the\r\nbrown species which live so much in the open air, and climb up trees and\r\nbushes, have retained and even deepened their dark colour; while others,\r\nsuch as the yellow meadow-ant, which lives almost entirely below ground,\r\nhave become much paler.' He might have added, as confirmatory evidence,\r\nthe fact that the perfect winged males and females of the yellow\r\nspecies, which fly about freely during the brief honeymoon in the open\r\nair, are even darker in hue than the brown garden-ant. But how the light\r\ncolour of the neuter workers gets transmitted through these dusky\r\nparents from one generation to another is part of that most insoluble\r\ncrux of all evolutionary reasoning--the transmission of special\r\nqualities to neuters by parents who have never possessed them.\r\n\r\nThis last-mentioned yellow meadow-ant has carried the system of\r\ndomestication further in all probability than any other species among\r\nits congeners. Not only do the yellow ants collect the root-feeding\r\naphides in their own nests, and tend them as carefully as their own\r\nyoung, but they also gather and guard the eggs of the aphides, which,\r\ntill they come to maturity, are of course quite useless. Sir John\r\nLubbock found that his yellow ants carried the winter eggs of a species\r\nof aphis into their nest, and there took great care of them. In the\r\nspring, the eggs hatched out; and the ants actually carried the young\r\naphides out of the nest again, and placed them on the leaves of a daisy\r\ngrowing in the immediate neighbourhood. They then built up a wall of\r\nearth over and round them. The aphides went on in their usual lazy\r\nfashion throughout the summer, and in October they laid another lot of\r\neggs, precisely like those of the preceding autumn. This case, as the\r\npractised observer himself remarks, is an instance of prudence\r\nunexampled, perhaps, in the animal kingdom, outside man. 'The eggs are\r\nlaid early in October on the food-plant of the insect. They are of no\r\ndirect use to the ants; yet they are not left where they are laid,\r\nexposed to the severity of the weather and to innumerable dangers, but\r\nbrought into their nests by the ants, and tended by them with the utmost\r\ncare through the long winter months until the following March, when the\r\nyoung ones are brought out again and placed on the young shoots of the\r\ndaisy.' Mr. White of Stonehouse has also noted an exactly similar\r\ninstance of formican providence.\r\n\r\nThe connection between so many ants and so many species of the aphides\r\nbeing so close and intimate, it does not seem extravagant to suppose\r\nthat the honey-tubes in their existing advanced form at least may be due\r\nto the deliberate selective action of these tiny insect-breeders.\r\nIndeed, when we consider that there are certain species of beetles which\r\nhave never been found anywhere except in ants' nests, it appears highly\r\nprobable that these domesticated forms have been produced by the ants\r\nthemselves, exactly as the dog, the sheep, and the cow, in their\r\nexisting types, have been produced by deliberate human selection. If\r\nthis be so, then there is nothing very out-of-the-way in the idea that\r\nthe ants have also produced the honey-tubes of aphides by their long\r\nselective action. It must be remembered that ants, in point of\r\nantiquity, date back, under one form or another, no doubt to a very\r\nremote period of geological time. Their immense variety of genera and\r\nspecies (over a thousand distinct kinds are known) show them to be a\r\nvery ancient family, or else they would not have had time to be\r\nspecially modified in such a wonderful multiformity of ways. Even as\r\nlong ago as the time when the tertiary deposits of Oeningen and\r\nRadoboj were laid down, Dr. Heer of Zurich has shown that at least\r\neighty-three distinct species of ants already existed; and the number\r\nthat have left no trace behind is most probably far greater. Some of the\r\nbeetles and woodlice which ants domesticate in their nests have been\r\nkept underground so long that they have become quite blind--that is to\r\nsay, have ceased altogether to produce eyes, which would be of no use to\r\nthem in their subterranean galleries; and one such blind beetle, known\r\nas Claviger, has even lost the power of feeding itself, and has to be\r\nfed by its masters from their own mandibles. Dr. Taschenberg enumerates\r\n300 species of true ants'-nest insects, mostly beetles, in Germany\r\nalone; and M. André gives a list of 584 kinds, habitually found in\r\nassociation with ants in one country or another. Compared with these\r\nsingular results of formican selection, the mere production or further\r\ndevelopment of the honey-tubes appears to be a very small matter.\r\n\r\nBut what good do the aphides themselves derive from the power of\r\nsecreting honey-dew? For we know now that no animal or plant is ever\r\nprovided with any organ or part merely for the benefit of another\r\ncreature: the advantage must at least be mutual. Well, in the first\r\nplace, it is likely that, in any case, the amount of sugary matter in\r\nthe food of the aphides is quite in excess of their needs; they\r\nassimilate the nitrogenous material of the sap, and secrete its\r\nsaccharine material as honey-dew. That, however, would hardly account\r\nfor the development of special secretory ducts, like the honey-tubes, in\r\nwhich you can actually see the little drops of honey rolling, under the\r\nmicroscope. But the ants are useful allies to the aphides, in guarding\r\nthem from another very dangerous type of insect. They are subject to the\r\nattacks of an ichneumon fly, which lays its eggs in them, meaning its\r\nlarvæ to feed upon their living bodies; and the ants watch over the\r\naphides with the greatest vigilance, driving off the ichneumons whenever\r\nthey approach their little _protégés_.\r\n\r\nMany other insects besides ants, however, are fond of the sweet\r\nsecretions of the aphides, and it is probable that the honey-dew thus\r\nacts to some extent as a preservative of the species, by diverting\r\npossible foes from the insects themselves, to the sugary liquid which\r\nthey distil from their food-plants. Having more than enough and to spare\r\nfor all their own needs, and the needs of their offspring, the\r\nplant-lice can afford to employ a little of their nutriment as a bribe\r\nto secure them from the attacks of possible enemies. Such compensatory\r\nbribes are common enough in the economy of nature. Thus our common\r\nEnglish vetch secretes a little honey on the stipules or wing-like\r\nleaflets on the stem, and so distracts thieving ants from committing\r\ntheir depredations upon the nectaries in the flowers, which are intended\r\nfor the attraction of the fertilising bees; and a South American acacia,\r\nas Mr. Belt has shown, bears hollow thorns and produces honey from a\r\ngland in each leaflet, in order to allure myriads of small ants which\r\nnest in the thorns, eat the honey, and repay the plant by driving away\r\ntheir leaf-cutting congeners. Indeed, as they sting violently, and issue\r\nforth in enormous swarms whenever the plant is attacked, they are even\r\nable to frighten off browsing cattle from their own peculiar acacia.\r\n\r\nAphides, then, are essentially degraded insects, which have become\r\nalmost vegetative in their habits, and even in their mode of\r\nreproduction, but which still retain a few marks of their original\r\ndescent from higher and more locomotive ancestors. Their wings,\r\nespecially, are useful to the perfect forms in finding one another, and\r\nto the imperfect ones in migrating from one plant to its nearest\r\nneighbours, where they soon become the parents of fresh hordes in rapid\r\nsuccession. Hence various kinds of aphides are among the most dreaded\r\nplagues of agriculturists. The 'fly,' which Kentish farmers know so well\r\non hops, is an aphis specialised for that particular bine; and, when\r\nonce it appears in the gardens, it spreads with startling rapidity from\r\none end of the long rows to the other. The phylloxera which has spoilt\r\nthe French vineyards is a root-feeding form that attacks the vine, and\r\nkills or maims the plant terribly, by sucking the vital juices on their\r\nway up into the fresh-forming foliage. The 'American blight' on apple\r\ntrees is yet another member of the same family, a wee creeping cottony\r\ncreature that hides among the fissures of the bark, and drives its very\r\nlong beak far down into the green sappy layer underlying the dead outer\r\ncovering. In fact, almost all the best-known 'blights' and\r\nbladder-forming insects are aphides of one kind or another, affecting\r\nleaves, or stalks, or roots, or branches.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the most remarkable examples of the limitation of human\r\npowers that while we can easily exterminate large animals like the wolf\r\nand the bear in England, or the puma and the wolverine in the settled\r\nStates of America, we should be so comparatively weak against the\r\nColorado beetle or the fourteen-year locust, and so absolutely powerless\r\nagainst the hop-fly, the turnip-fly, and the phylloxera. The smaller and\r\nthe more insignificant our enemy, viewed individually, the more\r\ndifficult is he to cope with in the mass. All the elephants in the world\r\ncould have been hunted down and annihilated, in all probability, with\r\nfar less labour than has been expended upon one single little all but\r\nmicroscopic parasite in France alone. The enormous rapidity of\r\nreproduction in the family of aphides is the true cause of our\r\nhelplessness before them. It has been calculated that a single aphis may\r\nduring its own lifetime become the progenitor of 5,904,900,000\r\ndescendants. Each imperfect female produces about ninety young ones,\r\nand lives long enough to see its children's children to the fifth\r\ngeneration. Now, ninety multiplied by ninety four times over gives the\r\nnumber above stated. Of course, this makes no allowance for casualties\r\nwhich must be pretty frequent: but even so, the sum-total of aphides\r\nproduced within a small garden in a single summer must be something very\r\nextraordinary.\r\n\r\nIt is curious, too, that aphides on the whole seem to escape the notice\r\nof insect-eating birds very tolerably. I cannot, in fact, discover that\r\nbirds ever eat them, their chief real enemy being the little lizard-like\r\nlarva of the lady-bird, which devours them everywhere greedily in\r\nimmense numbers. Indeed, aphides form almost the sole food of the entire\r\nlady-bird tribe in their earlier stages of existence; and there is no\r\nbetter way of getting rid of blight on roses and other garden plants\r\nthan to bring in a good boxful of these active and voracious little\r\ngrubs from the fields and hedges. They will pounce upon the aphides\r\nforthwith as a cat pounces upon the mice in a well-stocked barn or\r\nfarmyard. The two-spotted lady-bird in particular is the determined\r\nexterminator of the destructive hop-fly, and is much beloved accordingly\r\nby Kentish farmers. No doubt, one reason why birds do not readily see\r\nthe aphis of the rose and most other species is because of their\r\nprevailing green tint, and the close way in which they stick to the\r\nleaves or shoots on whose juices they are preying. But in the case of\r\nmany black and violet species, this protection of imitative colour is\r\nwanting, and yet the birds do not seem to care for the very conspicuous\r\nlittle insects on the broad bean, for example, whose dusky hue makes\r\nthem quite noticeable in large masses. Here there may very likely be\r\nsome special protection of nauseous taste in the aphides themselves (I\r\nwill confess that I have not ventured to try the experiment in person),\r\nas in many other instances we know that conspicuously-coloured insects\r\nadvertise their nastiness, as it were, to the birds by their own\r\ninteguments, and so escape being eaten in mistake for any of their less\r\nprotected relatives.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it seems pretty clear that certain plants have\r\nefficiently armed themselves against the aphides, in turn, by secreting\r\nbitter or otherwise unpleasant juices. So far as I can discover, the\r\nlittle plunderers seldom touch the pungent 'nasturtiums' or tropsælums\r\nof our flower-gardens, even when these grow side by side with other\r\nplants on which the aphides are swarming. Often, indeed, I find winged\r\nforms upon the leaf-stem of a nasturtium, having come there evidently in\r\nhopes of starting a new colony; but usually in a dead or dying\r\ncondition--the pungent juice seems to have poisoned them. So, too,\r\nspinach and lettuce may be covered with blight, while the bitter\r\nspurges, the woolly-leaved arabis, and the strong-scented thyme close by\r\nare utterly untouched. Plants seem to have acquired all these devices,\r\nsuch as close networks of hair upon the leaves, strong essences, bitter\r\nor pungent juices, and poisonous principles, mainly as deterrents for\r\ninsect enemies, of which caterpillars and plant-lice are by far the most\r\ndestructive. It would be unpardonable, of course, to write about\r\nhoney-dew without mentioning tobacco; and I may add parenthetically that\r\naphides are determined anti-tobacconists, nicotine, in fact, being a\r\ndeadly poison to them. Smoking with tobacco, or sprinkling with\r\ntobacco-water, are familiar modes of getting rid of the unwelcome\r\nintruders in gardens. Doubtless this peculiar property of the tobacco\r\nplant has been developed as a prophylactic against insect enemies: and\r\nif so, we may perhaps owe the weed itself, as a smokable leaf, to the\r\nlittle aphides. Granting this hypothetical connection, the name of\r\nhoney-dew would indeed be a peculiarly appropriate one. I may mention in\r\npassing that tobacco is quite fatal to almost all insects, a fact which\r\nI present gratuitously to the blowers of counterblasts, who are at\r\nliberty to make whatever use they choose of it. Quassia and aloes are\r\nalso well-known preventives of fly or blight in gardens.\r\n\r\nThe most complete life-history yet given of any member of the aphis\r\nfamily is that which M. Jules Lichtenstein has worked out with so much\r\ncare in the case of the phylloxera of the oak-tree. In April, the winter\r\neggs of this species, laid in the bark of an oak, each hatch out a\r\nwingless imperfect female, which M. Lichtenstein calls the foundress.\r\nAfter moulting four times, the foundress produces, by parthenogenesis, a\r\nnumber of false eggs, which it fastens to the leaf-stalks and under side\r\nof the foliage. These false eggs hatch out a larval form, wingless, but\r\nbigger than any of the subsequent generations; and the larvæ so produced\r\nthemselves once more give origin to more larvæ, which acquire wings, and\r\nfly away from the oak on which they were born to another of a different\r\nspecies in the same neighbourhood. There these larvæ of the second crop\r\nonce more lay false eggs, from which the third larval generation is\r\ndeveloped. This brood is again wingless, and it proceeds at once to bud\r\nout several generations more, by internal gemmation, as long as the warm\r\nweather lasts. According to M. Lichtenstein, all previous observations\r\nhave been made only on aphides of this third type; and he maintains that\r\nevery species in the whole family really undergoes an analogous\r\nalternation of generations. At last, when the cold weather begins to set\r\nin, a fourth larval form appears, which soon obtains wings, and flies\r\nback to the same kind of oak on which the foundresses were first hatched\r\nout, all the intervening generations having passed their lives in\r\nsucking the juices of the other oak to which the second larval form\r\nmigrated. The fourth type here produce perfect male and female insects,\r\nwhich are wingless, and have no sucking apparatus. The females, after\r\nbeing impregnated, lay a single egg each, which they hide in the bark,\r\nwhere it remains during the winter, till in spring it once more hatches\r\nout into a foundress, and the whole cycle begins over again. Whether all\r\nthe aphides do or do not pass through corresponding stages is not yet\r\nquite certain. But Kentish farmers believe that the hop-fly migrates to\r\nhop-bines from plum-trees in the neighbourhood; and M. Lichtenstein\r\nconsiders that such migrations from one plant to another are quite\r\nnormal in the family. We know, indeed, that many great plagues of our\r\ncrops are thus propagated, sometimes among closely related plants, but\r\nsometimes also among the most widely separated species. For example,\r\nturnip-fly (which is not an aphis, but a small beetle) always begins its\r\nravages (as Miss Ormerod has abundantly shown) upon a plot of charlock,\r\nand then spreads from patches of that weed to the neighbouring turnips,\r\nwhich are slightly diverse members of the same genus. But, on the other\r\nhand, it has long been well known that rust in wheat is specially\r\nconnected with the presence of the barberry bush; and it has recently\r\nbeen proved that the fungus which produces the disease passes its early\r\nstages on the barberry leaves, and only migrates in later generations to\r\nthe growing wheat. This last case brings even more prominently into\r\nlight than ever the essential resemblance of the aphides to\r\nplant-parasites.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MILK IN THE COCO-NUT\r\n\r\n\r\nFor many centuries the occult problem how to account for the milk in the\r\ncoco-nut has awakened the profoundest interest alike of ingenuous\r\ninfancy and of maturer scientific age. Though it cannot be truthfully\r\naffirmed of it, as of the cosmogony or creation of the world, in the\r\n'Vicar of Wakefield,' that it 'has puzzled the philosophers of all ages'\r\n(for Sanchoniathon was certainly ignorant of the very existence of that\r\ndelicious juice, and Manetho doubtless went to his grave without ever\r\nhaving tasted it fresh from the nut under a tropical verandah), yet it\r\nmay be safely asserted that for the last three hundred years the\r\nphilosopher who has not at some time or other of his life meditated upon\r\nthat abstruse question is unworthy of such an exalted name. The\r\ncosmogony and the milk in the coco-nut are, however, a great deal closer\r\ntogether in thought than Sanchoniathon or Manetho, or the rogue who\r\nquoted them so glibly, is ever at all likely, in his wildest moments, to\r\nhave imagined.\r\n\r\nThe coco-nut, in fact, is a subject well deserving of the most\r\nsympathetic treatment at the gentle hands of grateful humanity. No other\r\nplant is useful to us in so many diverse and remarkable manners. It has\r\nbeen truly said of that friend of man, the domestic pig, that he is all\r\ngood, from the end of his snout to the tip of his tail; but even the\r\npig, though he furnishes us with so many necessaries or luxuries--from\r\ntooth-brushes to sausages, from ham to lard, from pepsine wine to pork\r\npies--does not nearly approach, in the multiplicity and variety of his\r\nvirtues, the all-sufficing and world-supplying coco-nut. A Chinese\r\nproverb says that there are as many useful properties in the coco-nut\r\npalm as there are days in the year; and a Polynesian saying tells us\r\nthat the man who plants a coco-nut plants meat and drink, hearth and\r\nhome, vessels and clothing, for himself and his children after him. Like\r\nthe great Mr. Whiteley, the invaluable palm-tree might modestly\r\nadvertise itself as a universal provider. The solid part of the nut\r\nsupplies food almost alone to thousands of people daily, and the milk\r\nserves them for drink, thus acting as an efficient filter to the water\r\nabsorbed by the roots in the most polluted or malarious regions. If you\r\ntap the flower stalk you get a sweet juice, which can be boiled down\r\ninto the peculiar sugar called (in the charming dialect of commerce)\r\njaggery; or it can be fermented into a very nasty spirit known as\r\npalm-wine, toddy, or arrack; or it can be mixed with bitter herbs and\r\nroots to make that delectable compound 'native beer.' If you squeeze the\r\ndry nut you get coco-nut oil, which is as good as lard for frying when\r\nfresh, and is 'an excellent substitute for butter at breakfast,' on\r\ntropical tables. Under the mysterious name of copra (which most of us\r\nhave seen with awe described in the market reports as 'firm' or 'weak,'\r\n'receding' or 'steady') it forms the main or only export of many Oceanic\r\nislands, and is largely imported into this realm of England, where the\r\nthicker portion is called stearine, and used for making sundry candles\r\nwith fanciful names, while the clear oil is employed for burning in\r\nordinary lamps. In the process of purification, it yields glycerine; and\r\nit enters largely into the manufacture of most better-class soaps. The\r\nfibre that surrounds the nut makes up the other mysterious article of\r\ncommerce known as coir, which is twisted into stout ropes, or woven into\r\ncoco-nut matting and ordinary door-mats. Brushes and brooms are also\r\nmade of it, and it is used, not always in the most honest fashion, in\r\nplace of real horse-hair in stuffing cushions. The shell, cut in half,\r\nsupplies good cups, and is artistically carved by the Polynesians,\r\nJapanese, Hindoos, and other benighted heathen, who have not yet learnt\r\nthe true methods of civilised machine-made shoddy manufacture. The\r\nleaves serve as excellent thatch; on the flat blades, prepared like\r\npapyrus, the most famous Buddhist manuscripts are written; the long\r\nmid-ribs or branches (strictly speaking, the leaf-stalks) answer\r\nadmirably for rafters, posts, or fencing; the fibrous sheath at the base\r\nis a remarkable natural imitation of cloth, employed for strainers,\r\nwrappers, and native hats; while the trunk, or stem, passes in carpentry\r\nunder the name of porcupine wood, and produces beautiful effects as a\r\nwonderfully coloured cabinet-makers' material. These are only a few\r\nselected instances out of the innumerable uses of the coco-nut palm.\r\n\r\nApart even from the manifold merits of the tree that bears it, the milk\r\nitself has many and great claims to our respect and esteem, as everybody\r\nwho has ever drunk it in its native surroundings will enthusiastically\r\nadmit. In England, to be sure, the white milk in the dry nuts is a very\r\npoor stuff, sickly, and strong-flavoured, and rather indigestible. But\r\nin the tropics, coco-nut milk, or, as we oftener call it there, coco-nut\r\nwater, is a very different and vastly superior sort of beverage. At\r\neleven o'clock every morning, when you are hot and tired with the day's\r\nwork, your black servant, clad from head to foot in his cool clean white\r\nlinen suit, brings you in a tall soda glass full of a clear, light,\r\ncrystal liquid, temptingly displayed against the yellow background of a\r\nchased Benares brass-work tray. The lump of ice bobs enticingly up and\r\ndown in the centre of the tumbler, or clinks musically against the edge\r\nof the glass as he carries it along. You take the cool cup thankfully\r\nand swallow it down at one long draught; fresh as a May morning, pure as\r\nan English hillside spring, delicate as--well, as coco-nut water. None\r\nbut itself can be its parallel. It is certainly the most delicious,\r\ndainty, transparent, crystal drink ever invented. How did it get there,\r\nand what is it for?\r\n\r\nIn the early green stage at which coco-nuts are generally picked for\r\nhousehold use in the tropics the shell hasn't yet solidified into a hard\r\nstony coat, but still remains quite soft enough to be readily cut\r\nthrough with a sharp table knife--just like young walnuts picked for\r\npickling. If you cut one across while it's in this unsophisticated\r\nstate, it is easy enough to see the arrangement of the interior, and the\r\npart borne by the milk in the development and growth of the mature nut.\r\nThe ordinary tropical way of opening coco-nuts for table, indeed, is by\r\ncutting off the top of the shell and rind in successive slices, at the\r\nend where the three pores are situated, until you reach the level of the\r\nwater, which fills up the whole interior. The nutty part around the\r\ninside of the shell is then extremely soft and jelly-like, so that it\r\ncan be readily eaten with a spoon; but as a matter of fact very few\r\npeople ever do eat the flesh at all. After their first few months in the\r\ntropics, they lose the taste for this comparatively indigestible part,\r\nand confine themselves entirely (like patients at a German spa) to\r\ndrinking the water. A young coco-nut is thus seen to consist, first of a\r\ngreen outer skin, then of a fibrous coat, which afterwards becomes the\r\nhair, and next of a harder shell which finally gets quite woody; while\r\ninside all comes the actual seed or unripe nut itself. The office of the\r\ncoco-nut water is the deposition of the nutty part around the side of\r\nthe shell; it is, so to speak, the mother liquid, from which the harder\r\neatable portion is afterwards derived. This state is not uncommon in\r\nembryo seeds. In a very young pea, for example, the inside is quite\r\nwatery, and only the outer skin is at all solid, as we have all observed\r\nwhen green peas first come into season. But the special peculiarity of\r\nthe coco-nut consists in the fact that this liquid condition of the\r\ninterior continues even after the nut is ripe, and that is the really\r\ncurious point about the milk in the coco-nut which does actually need\r\naccounting for.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand it one ought to examine a coco-nut in the act of\r\nbudding, and to do this it is by no means necessary to visit the West\r\nIndies or the Pacific Islands; all you need to do is to ask a Covent\r\nGarden fruit salesman to get you a few 'growers.' On the voyage to\r\nEngland, a certain number of precocious coco-nuts, stimulated by the\r\ncongenial warmth and damp of most shipholds, usually begin to sprout\r\nbefore their time; and these waste nuts are sold by the dealers at a low\r\nrate to East-end children and inquiring botanists. An examination of a\r\n'grower' very soon convinces one what is the use of the milk in the\r\ncoco-nut.\r\n\r\nIt must be duly borne in mind, to begin with, that the prime end and\r\nobject of the nut is not to be eaten raw by the ingenious monkey, or to\r\nbe converted by lordly man into coco-nut biscuits, or coco-nut pudding,\r\nbut simply and solely to reproduce the coco-nut palm in sufficient\r\nnumbers to future generations. For this purpose the nut has slowly\r\nacquired by natural selection a number of protective defences against\r\nits numerous enemies, which serve to guard it admirably in the native\r\nstate from almost all possible animal depredators. First of all, the\r\nactual nut or seed itself consists of a tiny embryo plant, placed just\r\ninside the softest of the three pores or pits at the end of the shell,\r\nand surrounded by a vast quantity of nutritious pulp, destined to feed\r\nand support it during its earliest unprotected days, if not otherwise\r\ndiverted by man or monkey. But as whatever feeds a young plant will also\r\nfeed an animal, and as many animals betray a felonious desire to\r\nappropriate to their own wicked ends the food-stuffs laid up by the palm\r\nfor the use of its own seedling, the coco-nut has been compelled to\r\ninclose this particularly large and rich kernel in a very solid and\r\ndefensive shell. And, once more, since the palm grows at a very great\r\nheight from the ground--I have seen them up to ninety feet in favourable\r\ncircumstances--this shell stands a very good chance of getting broken in\r\ntumbling to the earth, so that it has been necessary to surround it with\r\na mass of soft and yielding fibrous material, which breaks its fall, and\r\nacts as a buffer to it when it comes in contact with the soil beneath.\r\nSo many protections has the coco-nut gradually devised for itself by the\r\ncontinuous survival of the best adapted amid numberless and endless\r\nspontaneous variations of all its kind in past time.\r\n\r\nNow, when the coco-nut has actually reached the ground at last, and\r\nproceeds to sprout in the spot where chance (perhaps in the bodily shape\r\nof a disappointed monkey) has chosen to cast it, these numerous\r\nsafeguards and solid envelopes naturally begin to prove decided\r\nnuisances to the embryo within. It starts under the great disadvantage\r\nof being hermetically sealed within a solid wooden shell, so that no\r\nwater can possibly get at it to aid it as most other seeds are aided in\r\nthe process of germination. Fancy yourself a seed-pea, anxious to\r\nsprout, but coated all round with a hard covering of impermeable\r\nsealing-wax, and you will be in a position faintly to appreciate the\r\nunfortunate predicament of a grower coco-nut. Natural selection,\r\nhowever--that _deus ex machinâ_ of modern science, which can perform\r\nsuch endless wonders, if only you give it time enough to work in and\r\nvariations enough to work upon--natural selection has come to the rescue\r\nof the unhappy plant by leaving it a little hole at the top of the\r\nshell, out of which it can push its feathery green head without\r\ndifficulty. Everybody knows that if you look at the sharp end of a\r\ncoco-nut you will see three little brown pits or depressions on its\r\nsurface. Most people also know that two of these are firmly stopped up\r\n(for a reason to which I shall presently recur), but that the third one\r\nis only closed by a slight film or very thin shell, which can be easily\r\nbored through with a pocket knife, so as to let the milk run off before\r\ncracking the shell. So much we have all learnt during our ardent pursuit\r\nof natural knowledge on half-holidays in early life. But we probably\r\nthen failed to observe that just opposite this soft hole lies a small\r\nroundish knob, imbedded in the pulp or eatable portion, which knob is in\r\nfact the embryo palm or seedling, for whose ultimate benefit the whole\r\narrangement (in brown and green) has been invented. That is very much\r\nthe way with man: he notices what concerns his own appetite, and omits\r\nall the really important parts of the whole subject. _We_ think the use\r\nof the hole is to let out the milk; but the nut knows that its real\r\nobject is to let out the seedling. The knob grows out at last into the\r\nyoung plantlet, and it is by means of the soft hole that it makes its\r\nescape through the shell to the air and the sunshine which it seeks\r\nwithout. This brings us really down at last to the true _raison d'être_\r\nfor the milk in the coco-nut. As the seed or kernel cannot easily get at\r\nmuch water from outside, it has a good supply of water laid up for it\r\nready beforehand within its own encircling shell. The mother liquid from\r\nwhich the pulp or nutty part has been deposited remains in the centre,\r\nas the milk, till the tiny embryo begins to sprout. As soon as it does\r\nso, the little knob which was at first so very small enlarges rapidly\r\nand absorbs the water, till it grows out into a big spongy cellular\r\nmass, which at last almost fills up the entire shell. At the same time,\r\nits other end pushes its way out through the soft hole, and then gives\r\nbirth to a growing bud at the top--the future stem and leaves--and to a\r\nnumber of long threads beneath--the future roots. Meanwhile, the spongy\r\nmass inside begins gradually to absorb all the nutty part, using up its\r\noils and starches for the purpose of feeding the young plant above,\r\nuntil it is of an age to expand its leaves to the open tropical sunlight\r\nand shift for itself in the struggle for life. It seems at first sight\r\nvery hard to understand how any tissue so solid as the pulp of coco-nut\r\ncan be thus softened and absorbed without any visible cause; but in the\r\nsubtle chemistry of living vegetation such a transformation is\r\ncomparatively simple and easy to perform. Nature sometimes works much\r\ngreater miracles than this in the same way: for example, what is called\r\nvegetable ivory, a substance so solid that it can be carved or turned\r\nonly with great difficulty, is really the kernel of another palm-nut,\r\nallied to the coco-palm, and its very stony particles are all similarly\r\nabsorbed during germination by the dissolving power of the young\r\nseedling.\r\n\r\nWhy, however, has the coco-nut three pores at the top instead of one,\r\nand why are two out of the three so carefully and firmly sealed up? The\r\nexplanation of this strange peculiarity is only to be found in the\r\nancestral history of the coco-nut kind. Most nuts, indeed, start in\r\ntheir earlier stage as if they meant to produce two or more seeds each;\r\nbut as they ripen, all the seeds except one become abortive. The almond,\r\nfor example, has in the flower two seeds or kernels to each nut; but in\r\nthe ripe state there is generally only one, though occasionally we find\r\nan almond with two--a philipoena, as we commonly call it--just to\r\nkeep in memory the original arrangement of its earlier ancestors. The\r\nreason for this is that plants whose fruits have no special protection\r\nfor their seeds are obliged to produce a great many of them at once, in\r\norder that one seed in a thousand may finally survive the onslaughts of\r\ntheir Argus-eyed enemies; but when they learn to protect themselves by\r\nhard coverings from birds and beasts, they can dispense with some of\r\nthese supernumerary seeds, and put more nutriment into each one of those\r\nthat they still retain. Compare, for example, the innumerable small\r\nround seedlets of the poppyhead with the solitary large and richly\r\nstored seed of the walnut, or the tiny black specks of mustard and cress\r\nwith the single compact and well-filled seed of the filbert and the\r\nacorn. To the very end, however, most nuts begin in the flower as if\r\nthey meant to produce a whole capsuleful of small unstored and\r\nunprotected seeds, like their original ancestors; it is only at the last\r\nmoment that they recollect themselves, suppress all their ovules except\r\none, and store that one with all the best and oiliest food-stuffs at\r\ntheir disposal. The nuts, in fact, have learned by long experience that\r\nit is better to be the only son and heir of a wealthy house, set up in\r\nlife with a good capital to begin upon, than to be one of a poor family\r\nof thirteen needy and unprovided children.\r\n\r\nNow, the coco-nuts are descended from a great tribe--the palms and\r\nlilies--which have as their main distinguishing peculiarity the\r\narrangement of parts in their flowers and fruits by threes each. For\r\nexample, in the most typical flowers of this great group, there are\r\nthree green outer calyx-pieces, three bright-coloured petals, three long\r\nouter stamens, three short inner stamens, three valves to the capsule,\r\nand three seeds or three rows of seeds in each fruit. Many palms still\r\nkeep pretty well to this primitive arrangement, but a few of them which\r\nhave specially protected or highly developed fruits or nuts have lost in\r\ntheir later stages the threefold disposition in the fruit, and possess\r\nonly one seed, often a very large one. There is no better and more\r\ntypical nut in the whole world than a coco-nut--that is to say, from our\r\npresent point of view at least, though the fear of that awful person,\r\nthe botanical Smelfungus, compels me to add that this is not quite\r\ntechnically true. Smelfungus, indeed, would insist upon it that the\r\ncoco-nut is not a nut at all, and would thrill us with the delightful\r\ninformation, innocently conveyed in that delicious dialect of which he\r\nis so great a master, that it is really 'a drupaceous fruit with a\r\nfibrous mesocarp.' Still, in spite of Smelfungus with his nice\r\nhair-splitting distinctions, it remains true that humanity at large will\r\nstill call a nut a nut, and that the coco-nut is the highest known\r\ndevelopment of the peculiar nutty tactics. It has the largest and most\r\nrichly stored seed of any known plant; and this seed is surrounded by\r\none of the hardest and most unmanageable of any known shells. Hence the\r\ncoco-nut has readily been able to dispense with the three kernels which\r\neach nut used in its earlier and less developed days to produce. But\r\nthough the palm has thus taken to reducing the number of its seeds in\r\neach fruit to the lowest possible point consistent with its continued\r\nexistence at all, it still goes on retaining many signs of its ancient\r\nthreefold arrangement. The ancestral and most deeply ingrained habits\r\npersist in the earlier stages; it is only in the mature form that the\r\nlater acquired habits begin fully to predominate. Even so our own boys\r\npass through an essentially savage childhood of ogres and fairies, bows\r\nand arrows, sugar-plums and barbaric nursery tales, as well as a\r\nromantic boyhood of mediæval chivalry and adventure, before they steady\r\ndown into that crowning glory of our race, the solid, sober,\r\nmatter-of-fact, commercial British Philistine. Hence the coco-nut in its\r\nunstripped state is roughly triangular in form, its angles answering to\r\nthe separate three fruits of simpler palms; and it has three pits or\r\nweak places in the shell, through which the embryos of the three\r\noriginal kernels used to force their way out. But as only one of them is\r\nnow needed, that one alone is left soft; the other two, which would be\r\nmerely a source of weakness to the plant if unprotected, are covered in\r\nthe existing nut by harder shell. Doubtless they serve in part to\r\ndeceive the too inquisitive monkey or other enemy, who probably\r\nconcludes that if one of the pits is hard and impermeable, the other two\r\nare so likewise.\r\n\r\nThough I have now, I hope, satisfactorily accounted for the milk in the\r\ncoco-nut, and incidentally for some other matters in its economy as\r\nwell, I am loth to leave the young seedling whom I have brought so far\r\non his way to the tender mercies of the winds and storms and tropical\r\nanimals, some of whom are extremely fond of his juicy and delicate\r\nshoots. Indeed, the growing point or bud of most palms is a very\r\npleasant succulent vegetable, and one kind--the West Indian mountain\r\ncabbage--deserves a better and more justly descriptive name, for it is\r\nreally much more like seakale or asparagus. I shall try to follow our\r\nyoung seedling on in life, therefore, so as to give, while I am about\r\nit, a fairly comprehensive and complete biography of a single\r\nflourishing coco-nut palm.\r\n\r\nBeginning, then, with the fall of the nut from the parent-tree, the\r\ntroubles of the future palm confront it at once in the shape of the\r\nnut-eating crab. This evil-disposed crustacean is common around the\r\nsea-coast of the eastern tropical islands, which is also the region\r\nmainly affected by the coco-nut palm; for coco-nuts are essentially\r\nshore-loving trees, and thrive best in the immediate neighbourhood of\r\nthe sea. Among the fallen nuts, the clumsy-looking thief of a crab (his\r\nappropriate Latin name is _Birgus latro_) makes great and dreaded havoc.\r\nTo assist him in his unlawful object he has developed a pair of front\r\nlegs, with specially strong and heavy claws, supplemented by a last or\r\ntail-end pair armed only with very narrow and slender pincers. He\r\nsubsists entirely upon a coco-nut diet. Setting to work upon a big\r\nfallen nut--with the husk on, coco-nuts measure in the raw state about\r\ntwelve inches the long way--he tears off all the coarse fibre bit by\r\nbit, and gets down at last to the hard shell. Then he hammers away with\r\nhis heavy claw on the softest eye-hole till he has pounded an opening\r\nright through it. This done he twists round his body so as to turn his\r\nback upon the coco-nut he is operating upon (crabs are never famous\r\neither for good manners or gracefulness) and proceeds awkwardly but\r\neffectually to extract all the white kernel or pulp through the breach\r\nwith his narrow pair of hind pincers. Like man, too, the robber-crab\r\nknows the value of the outer husk as well as of the eatable nut itself,\r\nfor he collects the fibre in surprising quantities to line his burrow,\r\nand lies upon it, the clumsy sybarite, for a luxurious couch. Alas,\r\nhowever, for the helplessness of crabs, and the rapacity and cunning of\r\nall-appropriating man! The spoil-sport Malay digs up the nest for the\r\nsake of the fibre it contains, which spares him the trouble of picking\r\njunk on his own account, and then he eats the industrious crab who has\r\nlaid it all up, while he melts down the great lump of fat under the\r\nrobber's capacious tail, and sometimes gets from it as much as a good\r\nquart of what may be practically considered as limpid coco-nut oil. _Sic\r\nvos non vobis_ is certainly the melancholy refrain of all natural\r\nhistory. The coco-nut palm intends the oil for the nourishment of its\r\nown seedling; the crab feloniously appropriates it and stores it up\r\nunder his capacious tail for future personal use; the Malay steals it\r\nagain from the thief for his own purposes; and ten to one the Dutch or\r\nEnglish merchant beguiles it from him with sized calico or poisoned rum,\r\nand transmits it to Europe, where it serves to lighten our nights and\r\nassist at our matutinal tub, to point a moral and adorn the present\r\ntale.\r\n\r\nIf, however, our coco-nut is lucky enough to escape the robber-crabs,\r\nthe pigs, and the monkeys, as well as to avoid falling into the hands of\r\nman, and being converted into the copra of commerce, or sold from a\r\ncostermonger's barrow in the chilly streets of ungenial London at a\r\npenny a slice, it may very probably succeed in germinating after the\r\nfashion I have already described, and pushing up its head through the\r\nsurrounding foliage to the sunlight above. As a rule, the coco-nut has\r\nbeen dropped by its mother tree on the sandy soil of a sea-beach; and\r\nthis is the spot it best loves, and where it grows to the stateliest\r\nheight. Sometimes, however, it falls into the sea itself, and then the\r\nloose husk buoys it up, so that it floats away bravely till it is cast\r\nby the waves upon some distant coral reef or desert island. It is this\r\npower of floating and surviving a long voyage that has dispersed the\r\ncoco-nut so widely among oceanic islands, where so few plants are\r\ngenerally to be found. Indeed, on many atolls or isolated reefs (for\r\nexample, on Keeling Island) it is the only tree or shrub that grows in\r\nany quantity, and on it the pigs, the poultry, the ducks, and the land\r\ncrabs of the place entirely subsist. In any case, wherever it happens to\r\nstrike, the young coco-nut sends up at first a fine rosette of big\r\nspreading leaves, not raised as afterwards on a tall stem, but springing\r\ndirect from the ground in a wide circle, something like a very big and\r\ngraceful fern. In this early stage nothing can be more beautiful or more\r\nessentially tropical in appearance than a plantation of young coco-nuts.\r\nTheir long feathery leaves spreading out in great clumps from the buried\r\nstock, and waving with lithe motion before the strong sea-breeze of the\r\nIndies, are the very embodiment of those deceptive ideal tropics which,\r\nalas, are to be found in actual reality nowhere on earth save in the\r\nartificial palm-houses at Kew, and the Casino Gardens at too entrancing\r\nMonte Carlo.\r\n\r\nFor the first two or three years the young palms must be well watered,\r\nand the soil around them opened; after which the tall graceful stem\r\nbegins to rise rapidly into the open air. In this condition it may be\r\nliterally said to make the tropics--those fallacious tropics, I mean, of\r\npainters and poets, of Enoch Arden and of Locksley Hall. You may observe\r\nthat whenever an artist wants to make a tropical picture, he puts a\r\ngroup of coco-nut palms in the foreground, as much as to say, 'You see\r\nthere's no deception; these are the genuine unadulterated tropics.' But\r\nas to painting the tropics without the palms, he might just as well\r\nthink of painting the desert without the camels. At eight or ten years\r\nold the tree flowers, bearing blossoms of the ordinary palm type,\r\ndegraded likenesses of the lilies and yuccas, greenish and\r\ninconspicuous, but visited by insects for the sake of their pollen. The\r\nflower, however, is fertilised by the wind, which carries the pollen\r\ngrains from one bunch of blossoms to another. Then the nuts gradually\r\nswell out to an enormous size, and ripen very slowly, even under the\r\nbrilliant tropical sun. (I will admit that the tropics are hot, though\r\nin other respects I hold them to be arrant impostors, like that\r\nprecocious American youth who announced on his tenth birthday that in\r\nhis opinion life wasn't all that it was cracked up to be.) But the worst\r\nthing about the coco-nut palm, the missionaries always say, is the\r\nfatal fact that, when once fairly started, it goes on bearing fruit\r\nuninterruptedly for forty years. This is very immoral and wrong of the\r\nill-conditioned tree, because it encourages the idyllic Polynesian to\r\nlie under the palms, all day long, cooling his limbs in the sea\r\noccasionally, sporting with Amaryllis in the shade, or with the tangles\r\nof Neæra's hair, and waiting for the nuts to drop down in due time, when\r\nhe ought (according to European notions) to be killing himself with hard\r\nwork under a blazing sky, raising cotton, sugar, indigo, and coffee, for\r\nthe immediate benefit of the white merchant, and the ultimate advantage\r\nof the British public. It doesn't enforce habits of steady industry and\r\nperseverance, the good missionaries say; it doesn't induce the native to\r\nfeel that burning desire for Manchester piece-goods and the other\r\nblessings of civilisation which ought properly to accompany the\r\npropagation of the missionary in foreign parts. You stick your nut in\r\nthe sand; you sit by a few years and watch it growing; you pick up the\r\nripe fruits as they fall from the tree; and you sell them at last for\r\nillimitable red cloth to the Manchester piece-goods merchant. Nothing\r\ncould be more simple or more satisfactory. And yet it is difficult to\r\nsee the precise moral distinction between the owner of a coco-nut grove\r\nin the South Sea Islands and the owner of a coal-mine or a big estate in\r\ncommercial England. Each lounges decorously through life after his own\r\nfashion; only the one lounges in a Russia leather chair at a club in\r\nPall Mall, while the other lounges in a nice soft dust-heap beside a\r\nrolling surf in Tahiti or the Hawaiian Archipelago.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, at a little distance from the sandy levels or alluvial\r\nflats of the sea-shore, the sea-loving coco-nut will not bring its nuts\r\nto perfection. It will grow, indeed, but it will not thrive or fruit in\r\ndue season. On the coast-line of Southern India, immense groves of\r\ncoco-nuts fringe the shore for miles and miles together; and in some\r\nparts, as in Travancore, they form the chief agricultural staple of the\r\nwhole country. 'The State has hence facetiously been called\r\nCoconutcore,' says its historian; which charmingly illustrates the true\r\nAnglo-Indian notion of what constitutes facetiousness, and ought to\r\nstrike the last nail into the coffin of a competitive examination\r\nsystem. A good tree in full bearing should produce 120 coco-nuts in a\r\nseason; so that a very small grove is quite sufficient to maintain a\r\nrespectable family in decency and comfort. Ah, what a mistake the\r\nEnglish climate made when it left off its primitive warmth of the\r\ntertiary period, and got chilled by the ice and snow of the Glacial\r\nEpoch down to its present misty and dreary wheat-growing condition! If\r\nit were not for that, those odious habits of steady industry and\r\nperseverance might never have been developed in ourselves at all, and we\r\nmight be lazily picking copra off our own coco-palms, to this day, to\r\nexport in return for the piece-goods of some Arctic Manchester situated\r\nsomewhere about the north of Spitzbergen or the New Siberian Islands.\r\n\r\nEven as things stand at the present day, however, it is wonderful how\r\nmuch use we modern Englishmen now make in our own houses of this far\r\nEastern nut, whose very name still bears upon its face the impress of\r\nits originally savage origin. From morning to night we never leave off\r\nbeing indebted to it. We wash with it as old brown Windsor or glycerine\r\nsoap the moment we leave our beds. We walk across our passages on the\r\nmats made from its fibre. We sweep our rooms with its brushes, and wipe\r\nour feet on it as we enter our doors. As rope, it ties up our trunks and\r\npackages; in the hands of the housemaid it scrubs our floors; or else,\r\nwoven into coarse cloth, it acts as a covering for bales and furniture\r\nsent by rail or steamboat. The confectioner undermines our digestion in\r\nearly life with coco-nut candy; the cook tempts us later on with\r\ncoco-nut cake; and Messrs. Huntley and Palmer cordially invite us to\r\ncomplete the ruin with coco-nut biscuits. We anoint our chapped hands\r\nwith one of its preparations after washing; and grease the wheels of our\r\ncarriages with another to make them run smoothly. Finally, we use the\r\noil to burn in our reading lamps, and light ourselves at last to bed\r\nwith stearine candles. Altogether, an amateur census of a single small\r\nEnglish cottage results in the startling discovery that it contains\r\ntwenty-seven distinct articles which owe their origin in one way or\r\nanother to the coco-nut palm. And yet we affect in our black ingratitude\r\nto despise the question of the milk in the coco-nut.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOD AND FEEDING\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a man and a bear meet together casually in an American forest, it\r\nmakes a great deal of difference, to the two parties concerned at least,\r\nwhether the bear eats the man or the man eats the bear. We haven't the\r\nslightest difficulty in deciding afterwards which of the two, in each\r\nparticular case, has been the eater, and which the eaten. Here, we say,\r\nis the grizzly that eat the man; or, here is the man that smoked and\r\ndined off the hams of the grizzly. Basing our opinion upon such familiar\r\nand well-known instances, we are apt to take it for granted far too\r\nreadily that between eating and being eaten, between the active and the\r\npassive voice of the verb _edo_, there exists necessarily a profound and\r\nimpassable native antithesis. To swallow an oyster is, in our own\r\npersonal histories, so very different a thing from being swallowed by a\r\nshark that we can hardly realise at first the underlying fundamental\r\nidentity of eating with mere coalescence. And yet, at the very outset of\r\nthe art of feeding, when the nascent animal first began to indulge in\r\nthis very essential animal practice, one may fairly say that no\r\npractical difference as yet existed between the creature that ate and\r\nthe creature that was eaten. After the man and the bear had finished\r\ntheir little meal, if one may be frankly metaphorical, it was impossible\r\nto decide whether the remaining being was the man or the bear, or which\r\nof the two had swallowed the other. The dinner having been purely\r\nmutual, the resulting animal represented both the litigants equally;\r\njust as, in cannibal New Zealand, the chief who ate up his brother chief\r\nwas held naturally to inherit the goods and chattels of the vanquished\r\nand absorbed rival, whom he had thus literally and physically\r\nincorporated.\r\n\r\nA jelly-speck, floating about at his ease in a drop of stagnant water\r\nunder the field of a microscope, collides accidentally with another\r\njelly-speck who happens to be travelling in the opposite direction\r\nacross the same miniature ocean. What thereupon occurs? One jelly-speck\r\nrolls itself gradually into the other, so that, instead of two, there is\r\nnow one; and the united body proceeds to float away quite unconcernedly,\r\nwithout waiting to trouble itself for a second with the profound\r\nmetaphysical question, which half of it is the original personality, and\r\nwhich half the devoured and digested. In these minute and very simple\r\nanimals there is absolutely no division of labour between part and part;\r\nevery bit of the jelly-like mass is alike head and foot and mouth and\r\nstomach. The jelly-speck has no permanent limbs, but it keeps putting\r\nforth vague arms and legs every now and then from one side or the other;\r\nand with these temporary and ever-dissolving members it crawls along\r\nmerrily through its tiny drop of stagnant water. If two of the legs or\r\narms happen to knock up casually against one another, they coalesce at\r\nonce, just like two drops of water on a window-pane, or two strings of\r\ntreacle slowly spreading along the surface of a plate. When the\r\njelly-speck meets any edible thing--a bit of dead plant, a wee creature\r\nlike itself, a microscopic egg--it proceeds to fold its own substance\r\nslimily around it, making, as it were, a temporary mouth for the purpose\r\nof swallowing it, and a temporary stomach for the purpose of quietly\r\ndigesting and assimilating it afterwards. Thus what at one moment is a\r\nfoot may at the next moment become a mouth, and at the moment after that\r\nagain a rudimentary stomach. The animal has no skin and no body, no\r\noutside and no inside, no distinction of parts or members, no\r\nindividuality, no identity. Roll it up into one with another of its\r\nkind, and it couldn't tell you itself a minute afterwards which of the\r\ntwo it had really been a minute before. The question of personal\r\nidentity is here considerably mixed.\r\n\r\nBut as soon as we get to rather larger creatures of the same type, the\r\nantithesis between the eater and the eaten begins to assume a more\r\ndefinite character. The big jelly-bag approaches a good many smaller\r\njelly-bags, microscopic plants, and other appropriate food-stuffs, and,\r\nsurrounding them rapidly with its crawling arms, envelopes them in its\r\nown substance, which closes behind them and gradually digests them.\r\nEverybody knows, by name at least, that revolutionary and evolutionary\r\nhero, the amoeba--the terror of theologians, the pet of professors,\r\nand the insufferable bore of the general reader. Well, this parlous and\r\nsubversive little animal consists of a comparatively large mass of soft\r\njelly, pushing forth slender lobes, like threads or fingers, from its\r\nown substance, and gliding about, by means of these tiny legs, over\r\nwater-plants and other submerged surfaces. But though it can literally\r\nturn itself inside out, like a glove, it still has some faint beginnings\r\nof a mouth and stomach, for it generally takes in food and absorbs water\r\nthrough a particular part of its surface, where the slimy mass of its\r\nbody is thinnest. Thus the amoeba may be said really to eat and\r\ndrink, though quite devoid of any special organs for eating or drinking.\r\n\r\nThe particular point to which I wish to draw attention here, however, is\r\nthis: that even the very simplest and most primitive animals do\r\ndiscriminate somehow between what is eatable and what isn't. The\r\namoeba has no eyes, no nose, no mouth, no tongue, no nerves of taste,\r\nno special means of discrimination of any kind; and yet, so long as it\r\nmeets only grains of sand or bits of shell, it makes no effort in any\r\nway to swallow them; but, the moment it comes across a bit of material\r\nfit for its food, it begins at once to spread its clammy fingers around\r\nthe nutritious morsel. The fact is, every part of the amoeba's body\r\napparently possesses, in a very vague form, the first beginnings of\r\nthose senses which in us are specialised and confined to a single spot.\r\nAnd it is because of the light which the amoeba thus incidentally\r\ncasts upon the nature of the specialised senses in higher animals that I\r\nhave ventured once more to drag out of the private life of his native\r\npond that already too notorious and obtrusive rhizopod.\r\n\r\nWith us lordly human beings, at the extreme opposite end in the scale of\r\nbeing from the microscopic jelly-specks, the art of feeding and the\r\nmechanism which provides for it have both reached a very high state of\r\nadvanced perfection. We have slowly evolved a tongue and palate on the\r\none hand, and French cooks and _pâté de foie gras_ on the other. But\r\nwhile everybody knows practically how things taste to us, and which\r\nthings respectively we like and dislike, comparatively few people ever\r\nrecognise that the sense of taste is not merely intended as a source of\r\ngratification, but serves a useful purpose in our bodily economy, in\r\ninforming us what we ought to eat and what to refuse. Paradoxical as it\r\nmay sound at first to most people, nice things are, in the main, things\r\nthat are good for us, and nasty things are poisonous or otherwise\r\ninjurious. That we often practically find the exact contrary the case\r\n(alas!) is due, not to the provisions of nature, but to the artificial\r\nsurroundings in which we live, and to the cunning way in which we\r\nflavour up unwholesome food, so as to deceive and cajole the natural\r\npalate. Yet, after all, it is a pleasant gospel that what we like is\r\nreally good for us, and, when we have made some small allowances for\r\nartificial conditions, it is in the main a true one also.\r\n\r\nThe sense of taste, which in the lowest animals is diffused equally over\r\nthe whole frame, is in ourselves and other higher creatures concentrated\r\nin a special part of the body, namely the mouth, where the food about to\r\nbe swallowed is chewed and otherwise prepared beforehand for the work of\r\ndigestion. Now it is, of course, quite clear that some sort of\r\nsupervision must be exercised by the body over the kind of food that is\r\ngoing to be put into it. Common experience teaches us that prussic acid\r\nand pure opium are undesirable food-stuffs in large quantities; that raw\r\nspirits, petroleum, and red lead should be sparingly partaken of by the\r\njudicious feeder; and that even green fruit, the bitter end of cucumber,\r\nand the berries of deadly nightshade are unsatisfactory articles of diet\r\nwhen continuously persisted in. If, at the very outset of our digestive\r\napparatus, we hadn't a sort of automatic premonitory adviser upon the\r\nkinds of food we ought or ought not to indulge in, we should naturally\r\ncommit considerable imprudences in the way of eating and drinking--even\r\nmore than we do at present. Natural selection has therefore provided us\r\nwith a fairly efficient guide in this respect in the sense of taste,\r\nwhich is placed at the very threshold, as it were, of our digestive\r\nmechanism. It is the duty of taste to warn us against uneatable things,\r\nand to recommend to our favourable attention eatable and wholesome ones;\r\nand, on the whole, in spite of small occasional remissness, it performs\r\nthis duty with creditable success.\r\n\r\nTaste, however, is not equally distributed over the whole surface of the\r\ntongue alike. There are three distinct regions or tracts, each of which\r\nhas to perform its own special office and function. The tip of the\r\ntongue is concerned mainly with pungent and acrid tastes; the middle\r\nportion is sensitive chiefly to sweets and bitters; while the back or\r\nlower portion confines itself almost entirely to the flavours of roast\r\nmeats, butter, oils, and other rich or fatty substances. There are very\r\ngood reasons for this subdivision of faculties in the tongue, the object\r\nbeing, as it were, to make each piece of food undergo three separate\r\nexaminations (like 'smalls,' 'mods,' and 'greats' at Oxford), which must\r\nbe successively passed before it is admitted into full participation in\r\nthe human economy. The first examination, as we shall shortly see, gets\r\nrid at once of substances which would be actively and immediately\r\ndestructive to the very tissues of the mouth and body; the second\r\ndiscriminates between poisonous and chemically harmless food-stuffs; and\r\nthe third merely decides the minor question whether the particular food\r\nis likely to prove then and there wholesome or indigestible to the\r\nparticular person. The sense of taste proceeds, in fact, upon the\r\nprinciple of gradual selection and elimination; it refuses first what is\r\npositively destructive, next what is more remotely deleterious, and\r\nfinally what is only undesirable or over-luscious.\r\n\r\nWhen we want to assure ourselves, by means of taste, about any unknown\r\nobject--say a lump of some white stuff, which may be crystal, or glass,\r\nor alum, or borax, or quartz, or rock-salt--we put the tip of the tongue\r\nagainst it gingerly. If it begins to burn us, we draw it away more or\r\nless rapidly with an accompaniment in language strictly dependent upon\r\nour personal habits and manners. The test we thus occasionally apply,\r\neven in the civilised adult state, to unknown bodies is one that is\r\nbeing applied every day and all day long by children and savages.\r\nUnsophisticated humanity is constantly putting everything it sees up to\r\nits mouth in a frank spirit of experimental inquiry as to its gustatory\r\nproperties. In civilised life we find everything ready labelled and\r\nassorted for us; we comparatively seldom require to roll the contents of\r\na suspicious bottle (in very small quantities) doubtfully upon the\r\ntongue in order to discover whether it is pale sherry or Chili vinegar,\r\nDublin stout or mushroom ketchup. But in the savage state, from which,\r\ngeologically and biologically speaking, we have only just emerged,\r\nbottles and labels do not exist. Primitive man, therefore, in his sweet\r\nsimplicity, has only two modes open before him for deciding whether the\r\nthings he finds are or are not strictly edible. The first thing he does\r\nis to sniff at them; and smell, being, as Mr. Herbert Spencer has well\r\nput it, an anticipatory taste, generally gives him some idea of what the\r\nthing is likely to prove. The second thing he does is to pop it into his\r\nmouth, and proceed practically to examine its further characteristics.\r\n\r\nStrictly speaking, with the tip of the tongue one can't really taste at\r\nall. If you put a small drop of honey or of oil of bitter almonds on\r\nthat part of the mouth, you will find (no doubt to your great surprise)\r\nthat it produces no effect of any sort; you only taste it when it begins\r\nslowly to diffuse itself, and reaches the true tasting region in the\r\nmiddle distance. But if you put a little cayenne or mustard on the same\r\npart, you will find that it bites you immediately--the experiment should\r\nbe tried sparingly--while if you put it lower down in the mouth you will\r\nswallow it almost without noticing the pungency of the stimulant. The\r\nreason is, that the tip of the tongue is supplied only with nerves which\r\nare really nerves of touch, not nerves of taste proper; they belong to a\r\ntotally different main branch, and they go to a different centre in the\r\nbrain, together with the very similar threads which supply the nerves\r\nof smell for mustard and pepper. That is why the smell and taste of\r\nthese pungent substances are so much alike, as everybody must have\r\nnoticed, a good sniff at a mustard-pot producing almost the same\r\nirritating effects as an incautious mouthful. As a rule we don't\r\naccurately distinguish, it is true, between these different regions of\r\ntaste in the mouth in ordinary life; but that is because we usually roll\r\nour food about instinctively, without paying much attention to the\r\nparticular part affected by it. Indeed, when one is trying deliberate\r\nexperiments in the subject, in order to test the varying sensitiveness\r\nof the different parts to different substances, it is necessary to keep\r\nthe tongue quite dry, in order to isolate the thing you are\r\nexperimenting with, and prevent its spreading to all parts of the mouth\r\ntogether. In actual practice this result is obtained in a rather\r\nludicrous manner--by blowing upon the tongue, between each experiment,\r\nwith a pair of bellows. To such undignified expedients does the pursuit\r\nof science lead the ardent modern psychologist. Those domestic rivals of\r\nDr. Forbes Winslow, the servants, who behold the enthusiastic\r\ninvestigator alternately drying his tongue in this ridiculous fashion,\r\nas if he were a blacksmith's fire, and then squeezing out a single drop\r\nof essence of pepper, vinegar, or beef-tea from a glass syringe upon the\r\ndry surface, not unnaturally arrive at the conclusion that master has\r\ngone stark mad, and that, in their private opinion, it's the microscope\r\nand the skeleton as has done it.\r\n\r\nAbove all things, we don't want to be flayed alive. So the kinds of\r\ntastes discriminated by the tip of the tongue are the pungent, like\r\npepper, cayenne and mustard; the astringent, like borax and alum; the\r\nalkaline, like soda and potash; the acid, like vinegar and green fruit;\r\nand the saline, like salt and ammonia. Almost all the bodies likely to\r\ngive rise to such tastes (or, more correctly, sensations of touch in\r\nthe tongue) are obviously unwholesome and destructive in their\r\ncharacter, at least when taken in large quantities. Nobody wishes to\r\ndrink nitric acid by the quart. The first business of this part of the\r\ntongue is, therefore, to warn us emphatically against caustic substances\r\nand corrosive acids, against vitriol and kerosene, spirits of wine and\r\nether, capsicums and burning leaves or roots, such as those of the\r\ncommon English lords-and-ladies. Things of this sort are immediately\r\ndestructive to the very tissues of the tongue and palate; if taken\r\nincautiously in too large doses, they burn the skin off the roof of the\r\nmouth; and when swallowed they play havoc, of course, with our internal\r\narrangements. It is highly advisable, therefore, to have an immediate\r\nwarning of these extremely dangerous substances, at the very outset of\r\nour feeding apparatus.\r\n\r\nThis kind of taste hardly differs from touch or burning. The sensibility\r\nof the tip of the tongue is only a very slight modification of the\r\nsensibility possessed by the skin generally, and especially by the inner\r\nfolds over all delicate parts of the body. We all know that common\r\ncaustic burns us wherever it touches; and it burns the tongue only in a\r\nsomewhat more marked manner. Nitric or sulphuric acid attacks the\r\nfingers each after its own kind. A mustard plaster makes us tingle\r\nalmost immediately; and the action of mustard on the tongue hardly\r\ndiffers, except in being more instantaneous and more discriminative.\r\nCantharides work in just the same way. If you cut a red pepper in two\r\nand rub it on your neck, it will sting just as it does when put into\r\nsoup (this experiment, however, is best tried upon one's younger\r\nbrother; if made personally, it hardly repays the trouble and\r\nannoyance). Even vinegar and other acids, rubbed into the skin, are\r\nfollowed by a slight tingling; while the effect of brandy, applied,\r\nsay, to the arms, is gently stimulating and pleasurable, somewhat in the\r\nsame way as when normally swallowed in conjunction with the habitual\r\nseltzer. In short, most things which give rise to distinct tastes when\r\napplied to the tip of the tongue give rise to fainter sensations when\r\napplied to the skin generally. And one hardly needs to be reminded that\r\npepper or vinegar placed (accidentally as a rule) on the inner surface\r\nof the eyelids produces a very distinct and unpleasant smart.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, the liability to be chemically affected by pungent or acid\r\nbodies is common to every part of the skin; but it is least felt where\r\nthe tough outer skin is thickest, and most felt where that skin is\r\nthinnest, and the nerves are most plentifully distributed near the\r\nsurface. A mustard plaster would probably fail to draw at all on one's\r\nheel or the palm of one's hand; while it is decidedly painful on one's\r\nneck or chest; and a mere speck of mustard inside the eyelid gives one\r\npositive torture for hours together. Now, the tip of the tongue is just\r\na part of one's body specially set aside for this very object, provided\r\nwith an extremely thin skin, and supplied with an immense number of\r\nnerves, on purpose so as to be easily affected by all such pungent,\r\nalkaline, or spirituous substances. Sir Wilfrid Lawson would probably\r\nconclude that it was deliberately designed by Providence to warn us\r\nagainst a wicked indulgence in the brandy and seltzer aforesaid.\r\n\r\nAt first sight it might seem as though there were hardly enough of such\r\npungent and fiery things in existence to make it worth while for us to\r\nbe provided with a special mechanism for guarding against them. That is\r\ntrue enough, no doubt, as regards our modern civilised life; though,\r\neven now, it is perhaps just as well that our children should have an\r\ninternal monitor (other than conscience) to dissuade them immediately\r\nfrom indiscriminate indulgence in photographic chemicals, the contents\r\nof stray medicine bottles, and the best dried West India chilies. But in\r\nan earlier period of progress, and especially in tropical countries\r\n(where the Darwinians have now decided the human race made its first\r\n_début_ upon this or any other stage), things were very different\r\nindeed. Pungent and poisonous plants and fruits abounded on every side.\r\nWe have all of us in our youth been taken in by some too cruelly waggish\r\ncompanion, who insisted upon making us eat the bright, glossy leaves of\r\nthe common English arum, which without look pretty and juicy enough, but\r\nwithin are full of the concentrated essence of pungency and profanity.\r\nWell, there are hundreds of such plants, even in cold climates, to tempt\r\nthe eyes and poison the veins of unsuspecting cattle or childish\r\nhumanity. There is buttercup, so horribly acrid that cows carefully\r\navoid it in their closest cropped pastures; and yet your cow is not\r\nusually a too dainty animal. There is aconite, the deadly poison with\r\nwhich Dr. Lamson removed his troublesome relatives. There is baneberry,\r\nwhose very name sufficiently describes its dangerous nature. There are\r\nhorse-radish, and stinging rocket, and biting wall-pepper, and still\r\nsmarter water-pepper, and worm-wood, and nightshade, and spurge, and\r\nhemlock, and half a dozen other equally unpleasant weeds. All of these\r\nhave acquired their pungent and poisonous properties, just as nettles\r\nhave acquired their sting, and thistles their thorns, in order to\r\nprevent animals from browsing upon them and destroying them. And the\r\nanimals in turn have acquired a very delicate sense of pungency on\r\npurpose to warn them beforehand of the existence of such dangerous and\r\nundesirable qualities in the plants which they might otherwise be\r\ntempted incautiously to swallow.\r\n\r\nIn tropical woods, where our 'hairy quadrumanous ancestor' (Darwinian\r\nfor the primæval monkey, from whom we are presumably descended) used\r\nplayfully to disport himself, as yet unconscious of his glorious destiny\r\nas the remote progenitor of Shakespeare, Milton, and the late Mr.\r\nPeace--in tropical woods, such acrid or pungent fruits and plants are\r\nparticularly common, and correspondingly annoying. The fact is, our\r\nprimitive forefather and all the other monkeys are, or were, confirmed\r\nfruit-eaters. But to guard against their depredations a vast number of\r\ntropical fruits and nuts have acquired disagreeable or fiery rinds and\r\nshells, which suffice to deter the bold aggressor. It may not be nice to\r\nget your tongue burnt with a root or fruit, but it is at least a great\r\ndeal better than getting poisoned; and, roughly speaking, pungency in\r\nexternal nature exactly answers to the rough gaudy labels which some\r\nchemists paste on bottles containing poisons. It means to say, 'This\r\nfruit or leaf, if you eat it in any quantities, will kill you.' That is\r\nthe true explanation of capsicums, pimento, colocynth, croton oil, the\r\nupas tree, and the vast majority of bitter, acrid, or fiery fruits and\r\nleaves. If we had to pick up our own livelihood, as our naked ancestors\r\nhad to do, from roots, seeds, and berries, we should far more readily\r\nappreciate this simple truth. We should know that a great many more\r\nplants than we now suspect are bitter or pungent, and therefore\r\npoisonous. Even in England we are familiar enough with such defences as\r\nthose possessed by the outer rind of the walnut; but the tropical\r\ncashew-nut has a rind so intensely acrid that it blisters the lips and\r\nfingers instantaneously, in the same way as cantharides would do. I\r\nbelieve that on the whole, taking nature throughout, more fruits and\r\nnuts are poisonous, or intensely bitter, or very fiery, than are sweet,\r\nluscious, and edible.\r\n\r\n'But,' says that fidgety person, the hypothetical objector (whom one\r\nalways sets up for the express purpose of promptly knocking him down\r\nagain), 'if it be the business of the fore part of the tongue to warn us\r\nagainst pungent and acrid substances, how comes it that we purposely use\r\nsuch things as mustard, pepper, curry-powder, and vinegar?' Well, in\r\nthemselves all these things are, strictly speaking, bad for us; but in\r\nsmall quantities they act as agreeable stimulants; and we take care in\r\npreparing most of them to get rid of the most objectionable properties.\r\nMoreover, we use them, not as foods, but merely as condiments. One drop\r\nof oil of capsicums is enough to kill a man, if taken undiluted; but in\r\nactual practice we buy it in such a very diluted form that comparatively\r\nlittle harm arises from using it. Still, very young children dislike all\r\nthese violent stimulants, even in small quantities; they won't touch\r\nmustard, pepper, or vinegar, and they recoil at once from wine or\r\nspirits. It is only by slow degrees that we learn these unnatural\r\ntastes, as our nerves get blunted and our palates jaded; and we all know\r\nthat the old Indian who can eat nothing but dry curries, devilled\r\nbiscuits, anchovy paste, pepper-pot, mulligatawny soup, Worcestershire\r\nsauce, preserved ginger, hot pickles, fiery sherry, and neat cognac, is\r\nalso a person with no digestion, a fragmentary liver, and very little\r\nchance of getting himself accepted by any safe and solvent insurance\r\noffice. Throughout, the warning in itself is a useful one; it is we who\r\nfoolishly and persistently disregard it. Alcohol, for example, tells us\r\nat once that it is bad for us; yet we manage so to dress it up with\r\nflavouring matters and dilute it with water that we overlook the fiery\r\ncharacter of the spirit itself. But that alcohol is in itself a bad\r\nthing (when freely indulged in) has been so abundantly demonstrated in\r\nthe history of mankind that it hardly needs any further proof.\r\n\r\nThe middle region of the tongue is the part with which we experience\r\nsensations of taste proper--that is to say, of sweetness and bitterness.\r\nIn a healthy, natural state all sweet things are pleasant to us, and all\r\nbitters (even if combined with sherry) unpleasant. The reason for this\r\nis easy enough to understand. It carries us back at once into those\r\nprimæval tropical forests, where our 'hairy ancestor' used to diet\r\nhimself upon the fruits of the earth in due season. Now, almost all\r\nedible fruits, roots, and tubers contain sugar; and therefore the\r\npresence of sugar is, in the wild condition, as good a rough test of\r\nwhether anything is good to eat as one could easily find. In fact, the\r\nargument cuts both ways: edible fruits are sweet because they are\r\nintended for man and other animals to eat; and man and other animals\r\nhave a tongue pleasurably affected by sugar because sugary things in\r\nnature are for them in the highest degree edible. Our early progenitors\r\nformed their taste upon oranges, mangoes, bananas, and grapes; upon\r\nsweet potatoes, sugar-cane, dates, and wild honey. There is scarcely\r\nanything fitted for human food in the vegetable world (and our earliest\r\nancestors were most undoubted vegetarians) which does not contain sugar\r\nin considerable quantities. In temperate climates (where man is but a\r\nrecent intruder), we have taken, it is true, to regarding wheaten bread\r\nas the staff of life; but in our native tropics enormous populations\r\nstill live almost exclusively upon plantains, bananas, bread-fruit,\r\nyams, sweet potatoes, dates, cocoanuts, melons, cassava, pine-apples,\r\nand figs. Our nerves have been adapted to the circumstances of our early\r\nlife as a race in tropical forests; and we still retain a marked liking\r\nfor sweets of every sort. Not content with our strawberries,\r\nraspberries, gooseberries, currants, apples, pears, cherries, plums and\r\nother northern fruits, we ransack the world for dates, figs, raisins,\r\nand oranges. Indeed, in spite of our acquired meat-eating propensities,\r\nit may be fairly said that fruits and seeds (including wheat, rice,\r\npeas, beans, and other grains and pulse) still form by far the most\r\nimportant element in the food-stuffs of human populations generally.\r\n\r\nBut besides the natural sweets, we have also taken to producing\r\nartificial ones. Has any housewife ever realised the alarming condition\r\nof cookery in the benighted generations before the invention of sugar?\r\nIt is really almost too appalling to think about. So many things that we\r\nnow look upon as all but necessaries--cakes, puddings, made dishes,\r\nconfectionery, preserves, sweet biscuits, jellies, cooked fruits, tarts,\r\nand so forth--were then practically quite impossible. Fancy attempting\r\nnowadays to live a single day without sugar; no tea, no coffee, no jam,\r\nno pudding, no cake, no sweets, no hot toddy before one goes to bed; the\r\nbare idea of it is too terrible. And yet that was really the abject\r\ncondition of all the civilised world up to the middle of the middle\r\nages. Horace's punch was sugarless and lemonless; the gentle Virgil\r\nnever tasted the congenial cup of afternoon tea; and Socrates went from\r\nhis cradle to his grave without ever knowing the flavour of peppermint\r\nbull's eyes. How the children managed to spend their Saturday _as_, or\r\ntheir weekly _obolus_, is a profound mystery. To be sure, people had\r\nhoney; but honey is rare, dear, and scanty; it can never have filled one\r\nquarter the place that sugar fills in our modern affections. Try for a\r\nmoment to realise drinking honey with one's whisky-and-water, or doing\r\nthe year's preserving with a pot of best Narbonne, and you get at once a\r\ncommon measure of the difference between the two as practical\r\nsweeteners. Nowadays, we get sugar from cane and beet-root in abundance,\r\nwhile sugar-maples and palm-trees of various sorts afford a considerable\r\nsupply to remoter countries. But the childhood of the little Greeks and\r\nRomans must have been absolutely unlighted by a single ray of joy from\r\nchocolate creams or Everton toffee.\r\n\r\nThe consequence of this excessive production of sweets in modern times\r\nis, of course, that we have begun to distrust the indications afforded\r\nus by the sense of taste in this particular as to the wholesomeness of\r\nvarious objects. We can mix sugar with anything we like, whether it had\r\nsugar in it to begin with or otherwise; and by sweetening and flavouring\r\nwe can give a false palatableness to even the worst and most\r\nindigestible rubbish, such as plaster-of-Paris, largely sold under the\r\nname of sugared almonds to the ingenuous youth of two hemispheres. But\r\nin untouched nature the test rarely or never fails. As long as fruits\r\nare unripe and unfit for human food, they are green and sour; as soon as\r\nthey ripen they become soft and sweet, and usually acquire some bright\r\ncolour as a sort of advertisement of their edibility. In the main, bar\r\nthe accidents of civilisation, whatever is sweet is good to eat--nay\r\nmore, is meant to be eaten; it is only our own perverse folly that makes\r\nus sometimes think all nice things bad for us, and all wholesome things\r\nnasty. In a state of nature, the exact opposite is really the case. One\r\nmay observe, too, that children, who are literally young savages in more\r\nsenses than one, stand nearer to the primitive feeling in this respect\r\nthan grown-up people. They unaffectedly like sweets; adults, who have\r\ngrown more accustomed to the artificial meat diet, don't, as a rule,\r\ncare much for puddings, cakes, and made dishes. (May I venture\r\nparenthetically to add, any appearance to the contrary notwithstanding,\r\nthat I am not a vegetarian, and that I am far from desiring to bring\r\ndown upon my devoted head the imprecation pronounced against the rash\r\nperson who would rob a poor man of his beer. It is quite possible to\r\nbelieve that vegetarianism was the starting point of the race, without\r\nwishing to consider it also as the goal; just as it is quite possible to\r\nregard clothes as purely artificial products of civilisation, without\r\ndesiring personally to return to the charming simplicity of the Garden\r\nof Eden.)\r\n\r\nBitter things in nature at large, on the contrary, are almost invariably\r\npoisonous. Strychnia, for example, is intensely bitter, and it is well\r\nknown that life cannot be supported on strychnia alone for more than a\r\nfew hours. Again, colocynth and aloes are far from being wholesome food\r\nstuffs, for a continuance; and the bitter end of cucumber does not\r\nconduce to the highest standard of good living. The bitter matter in\r\ndecaying apples is highly injurious when swallowed, which it isn't\r\nlikely to be by anybody who ever tastes it. Wormwood and walnut-shells\r\ncontain other bitter and poisonous principles; absinthe, which is made\r\nfrom one of them, is a favourite slow poison with the fashionable young\r\nmen of Paris, who wish to escape prematurely from 'Le monde où l'on\r\ns'ennuie.' But prussic acid is the commonest component in all natural\r\nbitters, being found in bitter almonds, apple pips, the kernels of\r\nmangosteens, and many other seeds and fruits. Indeed, one may say\r\nroughly that the object of nature generally is to prevent the actual\r\nseeds of edible fruits from being eaten and digested; and for this\r\npurpose, while she stores the pulp with sweet juices, she encloses the\r\nseed itself in hard stony coverings, and makes it nasty with bitter\r\nessences. Eat an orange-pip, and you will promptly observe how effectual\r\nis this arrangement. As a rule, the outer rind of nuts is bitter, and\r\nthe inner kernel of edible fruits. The tongue thus warns us immediately\r\nagainst bitter things, as being poisonous, and prevents us automatically\r\nfrom swallowing them.\r\n\r\n'But how is it,' asks our objector again, 'that so many poisons are\r\ntasteless, or even, like sugar of lead, pleasant to the palate?' The\r\nanswer is (you see, we knock him down again, as usual) because these\r\npoisons are themselves for the most part artificial products; they do\r\nnot occur in a state of nature, at least in man's ordinary surroundings.\r\nAlmost every poisonous thing that we are really liable to meet with in\r\nthe wild state we are warned against at once by the sense of taste; but\r\nof course it would be absurd to suppose that natural selection could\r\nhave produced a mode of warning us against poisons which have never\r\nbefore occurred in human experience. One might just as well expect that\r\nit should have rendered us dynamite-proof, or have given us a skin like\r\nthe hide of a rhinoceros to protect us against the future contingency of\r\nthe invention of rifles.\r\n\r\nSweets and bitters are really almost the only tastes proper, almost the\r\nonly ones discriminated by this central and truly gustatory region of\r\nthe tongue and palate. Most so-called flavourings will be found on\r\nstrict examination to be nothing more than mixtures with these of\r\ncertain smells, or else of pungent, salty, or alkaline matters,\r\ndistinguished as such by the tip of the tongue. For instance,\r\nparadoxical as it sounds to say so, cinnamon has really no taste at all,\r\nbut only a smell. Nobody will ever believe this on first hearing, but\r\nnothing on earth is easier than to put it to the test. Take a small\r\npiece of cinnamon, hold your nose tightly, rather high up, between the\r\nthumb and finger, and begin chewing it. You will find that it is\r\nabsolutely tasteless; you are merely chewing a perfectly insipid bit of\r\nbark. Then let go your nose, and you will find immediately that it\r\n'tastes' strongly, though in reality it is only the perfume from it that\r\nyou now permit to rise into the smelling-chamber in the nose. So, again,\r\ncloves have only a pungent taste and a peculiar smell, and the same is\r\nthe case more or less with almost all distinctive flavourings. When you\r\ncome to find of what they are made up, they consist generally of sweets\r\nor bitters, intermixed with certain ethereal perfumes, or with pungent\r\nor acid tastes, or with both or several such together. In this way, a\r\ncomparatively small number of original elements, variously combined,\r\nsuffice to make up the whole enormous mass of recognisably different\r\ntastes and flavours.\r\n\r\nThe third and lowest part of the tongue and throat is the seat of those\r\npeculiar tastes to which Professor Bain, the great authority upon this\r\nimportant philosophical subject, has given the names of relishes and\r\ndisgusts. It is here, chiefly, that we taste animal food, fats, butters,\r\noils, and the richer class of vegetables and made dishes. If we like\r\nthem, we experience a sensation which may be called a relish, and which\r\ninduces one to keep rolling the morsel farther down the throat, till it\r\npasses at last beyond the region of our voluntary control. If we don't\r\nlike them, we get the sensation which may be called a disgust, and which\r\nis very different from the mere unpleasantness of excessively pungent or\r\nbitter things. It is far less of an intellectual and far more of a\r\nphysical and emotional feeling. We say, and say rightly, of such things\r\nthat we find it hard to swallow them; a something within us (of a very\r\ntangible nature) seems to rise up bodily and protest against them. As a\r\nvery good example of this experience, take one's first attempt to\r\nswallow cod-liver oil. Other things may be unpleasant or unpalatable,\r\nbut things of this class are in the strictest sense nasty and\r\ndisgusting.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, the lower part of the tongue is supplied with nerves in\r\nclose sympathy with the digestion. If the food which has been passed by\r\nthe two previous examiners is found here to be simple and digestible, it\r\nis permitted to go on unchallenged; if it is found to be too rich, too\r\nbilious, or too indigestible, a protest is promptly entered against it,\r\nand if we are wise we will immediately desist from eating any more of\r\nit. It is here that the impartial tribunal of nature pronounces\r\ndefinitely against roast goose, mince pies, _pâté de foie gras_, sally\r\nlunn, muffins and crumpets, and creamy puddings. It is here, too, that\r\nthe slightest taint in meat, milk, or butter is immediately detected;\r\nthat rancid pastry from the pastrycook's is ruthlessly exposed; and that\r\nthe wiles of the fishmonger are set at naught by the judicious palate.\r\nIt is the special duty, in fact, of this last examiner to discover, not\r\nwhether food is positively destructive, not whether it is poisonous or\r\ndeleterious in nature, but merely whether it is then and there\r\ndigestible or undesirable.\r\n\r\nAs our state of health varies greatly from time to time, however, so do\r\nthe warnings of this last sympathetic adviser change and flicker. Sweet\r\nthings are always sweet, and bitter things always bitter; vinegar is\r\nalways sour, and ginger always hot in the mouth, too, whatever our state\r\nof health or feeling. But our taste for roast loin of mutton, high game,\r\nsalmon cutlets, and Gorgonzola cheese varies immensely from time to\r\ntime, with the passing condition of our health and digestion. In\r\nillness, and especially in sea-sickness, one gets the distaste carried\r\nto the extreme: you may eat grapes or suck an orange in the chops of the\r\nChannel, but you do not feel warmly attached to the steward who offers\r\nyou a basin of greasy ox-tail, or consoles you with promises of ham\r\nsandwiches in half a minute. Under those two painful conditions it is\r\nthe very light, fresh, and stimulating things that one can most easily\r\nswallow--champagne, soda-water, strawberries, peaches; not lobster\r\nsalad, sardines on toast, green Chartreuse, or hot brandy-and-water. On\r\nthe other hand, in robust health, and when hungry with exercise, you can\r\neat fat pork with relish on a Scotch hillside, or dine off fresh salmon\r\nthree days running without inconvenience. Even a Spanish stew, with\r\nplenty of garlic in it, and floating in olive oil, tastes positively\r\ndelicious after a day's mountaineering in the Pyrenees.\r\n\r\nThe healthy popular belief, still surviving in spite of cookery, that\r\nour likes and dislikes are the best guide to what is good for us, finds\r\nits justification in this fact, that whatever is relished will prove on\r\nthe average wholesome, and whatever rouses disgust will prove on the\r\nwhole indigestible. Nothing can be more wrong, for example, than to make\r\nchildren eat fat when they don't want it. A healthy child likes fat, and\r\neats as much of it as he can get. If a child shows signs of disgust at\r\nfat, that proves that it is of a bilious temperament, and it ought never\r\nto be forced into eating it against its will. Most of us are bilious in\r\nafter-life just because we were compelled to eat rich food in childhood,\r\nwhich we felt instinctively was unsuitable for us. We might still be\r\nindulging with impunity in thick turtle, canvas-back ducks, devilled\r\nwhitebait, meringues, and Nesselrode puddings, if we hadn't been so\r\npersistently overdosed in our earlier years with things that we didn't\r\nwant and knew were indigestible.\r\n\r\nOf course, in our existing modern cookery, very few simple and\r\nuncompounded tastes are still left to us; everything is so mixed up\r\ntogether that only by an effort of deliberate experiment can one\r\ndiscover what are the special effects of special tastes upon the tongue\r\nand palate. Salt is mixed with almost everything we eat--_sal sapit\r\nomnia_--and pepper or cayenne is nearly equally common. Butter is put\r\ninto the peas, which have been previously adulterated by being boiled\r\nwith mint; and cucumber is unknown except in conjunction with oil and\r\nvinegar. This makes it comparatively difficult for us to realise the\r\ndistinctness of the elements which go to make up most tastes as we\r\nactually experience them. Moreover, a great many eatable objects have\r\nhardly any taste of their own, properly speaking, but only a feeling of\r\nsoftness, or hardness, or glutinousness in the mouth, mainly observed in\r\nthe act of chewing them. For example, plain boiled rice is almost wholly\r\ninsipid; but even in its plainest form salt has usually been boiled with\r\nit, and in practice we generally eat it with sugar, preserves, curry, or\r\nsome other strongly flavoured condiment. Again, plain boiled tapioca and\r\nsago (in water) are as nearly tasteless as anything can be; they merely\r\nyield a feeling of gumminess; but milk, in which they are oftenest\r\ncooked, gives them a relish (in the sense here restricted), and sugar,\r\neggs, cinnamon, or nutmeg are usually added by way of flavouring. Even\r\nturbot has hardly any taste proper, except in the glutinous skin, which\r\nhas a faint relish; the epicure values it rather because of its\r\nsoftness, its delicacy, and its light flesh. Gelatine by itself is\r\nmerely very swallowable; we must mix sugar, wine, lemon-juice, and other\r\nflavourings in order to make it into good jelly. Salt, spices, essences,\r\nvanilla, vinegar, pickles, capers, ketchups, sauces, chutneys,\r\nlime-juice, curry, and all the rest, are just our civilised expedients\r\nfor adding the pleasure of pungency and acidity to naturally insipid\r\nfoods, by stimulating the nerves of touch in the tongue, just as sugar\r\nis our tribute to the pure gustatory sense, and oil, butter, bacon,\r\nlard, and the various fats used in frying to the sense of relish which\r\nforms the last element in our compound taste. A boiled sole is all very\r\nwell when one is just convalescent, but in robust health we demand the\r\ndelights of egg and bread-crumb, which are after all only the vehicle\r\nfor the appetising grease. Plain boiled macaroni may pass muster in the\r\nunsophisticated nursery, but in the pampered dining-room it requires the\r\naid of toasted parmesan. Good modern cookery is the practical result of\r\ncenturies of experience in this direction; the final flower of ages of\r\nevolution, devoted to the equalisation of flavours in all human food.\r\nThink of the generations of fruitless experiment that must have passed\r\nbefore mankind discovered that mint sauce (itself a cunning compound of\r\nvinegar and sugar) ought to be eaten with leg of lamb, that roast goose\r\nrequired a corrective in the shape of apple, and that while a\r\npre-established harmony existed between salmon and lobster, oysters were\r\nordained beforehand by nature as the proper accompaniment of boiled cod.\r\nWhenever I reflect upon such things, I become at once a good Positivist,\r\nand offer up praise in my own private chapel to the Spirit of Humanity\r\nwhich has slowly perfected these profound rules of good living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDE BANANA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe title which heads this paper is intended to be Latin, and is\r\nmodelled on the precedent of the De Amicitia, De Senectute, De Corona,\r\nand other time-honoured plagues of our innocent boyhood. It is meant to\r\ngive dignity and authority to the subject with which it deals, as well\r\nas to rouse curiosity in the ingenuous breast of the candid reader, who\r\nmay perhaps mistake it, at first sight, for negro-English, or for the\r\nname of a distinguished Norman family. In anticipation of the possible\r\nobjection that the word 'Banana' is not strictly classical, I would\r\nhumbly urge the precept and example of my old friend Horace--enemy I\r\nonce thought him--who expresses his approbation of those happy\r\ninnovations whereby Latium was gradually enriched with a copious\r\nvocabulary. I maintain that if Banana, bananæ, &c., is not already a\r\nLatin noun of the first declension, why then it ought to be, and it\r\nshall be in future. Linnæus indeed thought otherwise. He too assigned\r\nthe plant and fruit to the first declension, but handed it over to none\r\nother than our earliest acquaintance in the Latin language, Musa. He\r\ncalled the banana _Musa sapientum_. What connection he could possibly\r\nconceive between that woolly fruit and the daughters of the ægis-bearing\r\nZeus, or why he should consider it a proof of wisdom to eat a\r\nparticularly indigestible and nightmare-begetting food-stuff, passes my\r\nhumble comprehension. The muses, so far as I have personally noticed\r\ntheir habits, always greatly prefer the grape to the banana, and wise\r\nmen shun the one at least as sedulously as they avoid the other.\r\n\r\nLet it not for a moment be supposed, however, that I wish to treat the\r\nuseful and ornamental banana with intentional disrespect. On the\r\ncontrary, I cherish for it--at a distance--feelings of the highest\r\nesteem and admiration. We are so parochial in our views, taking us as a\r\nspecies, that I dare say very few English people really know how\r\nimmensely useful a plant is the common banana. To most of us it\r\nenvisages itself merely as a curious tropical fruit, largely imported at\r\nCovent Garden, and a capital thing to stick on one of the tall\r\ndessert-dishes when you give a dinner-party, because it looks\r\ndelightfully foreign, and just serves to balance the pine-apple at the\r\nopposite end of the hospitable mahogany. Perhaps such innocent readers\r\nwill be surprised to learn that bananas and plantains supply the\r\nprincipal food-stuff of a far larger fraction of the human race than\r\nthat which is supported by wheaten bread. They form the veritable staff\r\nof life to the inhabitants of both eastern and western tropics. What the\r\npotato is to the degenerate descendant of Celtic kings; what the oat is\r\nto the kilted Highlandman; what rice is to the Bengalee, and Indian corn\r\nto the American negro, that is the muse of sages (I translate literally\r\nfrom the immortal Swede) to African savages and Brazilian slaves.\r\nHumboldt calculated that an acre of bananas would supply a greater\r\nquantity of solid food to hungry humanity than could possibly be\r\nextracted from the same extent of cultivated ground by any other known\r\nplant. So you see the question is no small one; to sing the praise of\r\nthis Linnæan muse is a task well worthy of the Pierian muses.\r\n\r\nDo you know the outer look and aspect of the banana plant? If not, then\r\nyou have never voyaged to those delusive tropics. Tropical vegetation,\r\nas ordinarily understood by poets and painters, consists entirely of the\r\ncoco-nut palm and the banana bush. Do you wish to paint a beautiful\r\npicture of a rich ambrosial tropical island, _à la_ Tennyson--a summer\r\nisle of Eden lying in dark purple spheres of sea?--then you introduce a\r\ngroup of coco-nuts, whispering in odorous heights of even, in the very\r\nforeground of your pretty sketch, just to let your public understand at\r\na glance that these are the delicious poetical tropics. Do you desire to\r\ncreate an ideal paradise, _à la_ Bernardin de St. Pierre, where idyllic\r\nVirginies die of pure modesty rather than appear before the eyes of\r\ntheir beloved but unwedded Pauls in a lace-bedraped _peignoir_?--then\r\nyou strike the keynote by sticking in the middle distance a hut or\r\ncottage, overshadowed by the broad and graceful foliage of the\r\npicturesque banana. ('Hut' is a poor and chilly word for these glowing\r\ndescriptions, far inferior to the pretty and high-sounding original\r\n_chaumière_.) That is how we do the tropics when we want to work upon\r\nthe emotions of the reader. But it is all a delicate theatrical\r\nillusion; a trick of art meant to deceive and impose upon the unwary who\r\nhave never been there, and would like to think it all genuine. In\r\nreality, nine times out of ten, you might cast your eyes casually around\r\nyou in any tropical valley, and, if there didn't happen to be a native\r\ncottage with a coco-nut grove and banana patch anywhere in the\r\nneighbourhood, you would see nothing in the way of vegetation which you\r\nmightn't see at home any day in Europe. But what painter would ever\r\nventure to paint the tropics without the palm trees? He might just as\r\nwell try to paint the desert without the camels, or to represent St.\r\nSebastian without a sheaf of arrows sticking unperceived in the calm\r\ncentre of his unruffled bosom, to mark and emphasise his Sebastianic\r\npersonality.\r\n\r\nStill, I will frankly admit that the banana itself, with its practically\r\nalmost identical relation, the plantain, is a real bit of tropical\r\nfoliage. I confess to a settled prejudice against the tropics generally,\r\nbut I allow the sunsets, the coco-nuts, and the bananas. The true stem\r\ncreeps underground, and sends up each year an upright branch, thickly\r\ncovered with majestic broad green leaves, somewhat like those of the\r\ncanna cultivated in our gardens as 'Indian shot,' but far larger,\r\nnobler, and handsomer. They sometimes measure from six to ten feet in\r\nlength, and their thick midrib and strongly marked diverging veins give\r\nthem a very lordly and graceful appearance. But they are apt in practice\r\nto suffer much from the fury of the tropical storms. The wind rips the\r\nleaves up between the veins as far as the midrib in tangled tatters; so\r\nthat after a good hurricane they look more like coco-nut palm leaves\r\nthan like single broad masses of foliage as they ought properly to do.\r\nThis, of course, is the effect of a gentle and balmy hurricane--a mere\r\ncapful of wind that tears and tatters them. After a really bad storm\r\n(one of the sort when you tie ropes round your wooden house to prevent\r\nits falling bodily to pieces, I mean) the bananas are all actually blown\r\ndown, and the crop for that season utterly destroyed. The apparent stem,\r\nbeing merely composed of the overlapping and sheathing leaf-stalks, has\r\nnaturally very little stability; and the soft succulent trunk\r\naccordingly gives way forthwith at the slightest onslaught. This\r\nliability to be blown down in high winds forms the weak point of the\r\nplantain, viewed as a food-stuff crop. In the South Sea Islands, where\r\nthere is little shelter, the poor Fijian, in cannibal days, often lost\r\nhis one means of subsistence from this cause, and was compelled to\r\nsatisfy the pangs of hunger on the plump persons of his immediate\r\nrelatives. But since the introduction of Christianity, and of a dwarf\r\nstout wind-proof variety of banana, his condition in this respect, I am\r\nglad to say, has been greatly ameliorated.\r\n\r\nBy descent the banana bush is a developed tropical lily, not at all\r\nremotely allied to the common iris, only that its flowers and fruit are\r\nclustered together on a hanging spike, instead of growing solitary and\r\nseparate as in the true irises. The blossoms, which, though pretty, are\r\ncomparatively inconspicuous for the size of the plant, show the\r\nextraordinary persistence of the lily type; for almost all the vast\r\nnumber of species, more or less directly descended from the primitive\r\nlily, continue to the very end of the chapter to have six petals, six\r\nstamens, and three rows of seeds in their fruits or capsules. But\r\npractical man, with his eye always steadily fixed on the one important\r\nquality of edibility--the sum and substance to most people of all\r\nbotanical research--has confined his attention almost entirely to the\r\nfruit of the banana. In all essentials (other than the systematically\r\nunimportant one just alluded to) the banana fruit in its original state\r\nexactly resembles the capsule of the iris--that pretty pod that divides\r\nin three when ripe, and shows the delicate orange-coated seeds lying in\r\ntriple rows within--only, in the banana, the fruit does not open; in the\r\nsweet language of technical botany, it is an indehiscent capsule; and\r\nthe seeds, instead of standing separate and distinct, as in the iris,\r\nare embedded in a soft and pulpy substance which forms the edible and\r\npractical part of the entire arrangement.\r\n\r\nThis is the proper appearance of the original and natural banana, before\r\nit has been taken in hand and cultivated by tropical man. When cut\r\nacross the middle, it ought to show three rows of seeds, interspersed\r\nwith pulp, and faintly preserving some dim memory of the dividing wall\r\nwhich once separated them. In practice, however, the banana differs\r\nwidely from this theoretical ideal, as practice often _will_ differ\r\nfrom theory; for it has been so long cultivated and selected by\r\nman--being probably one of the very oldest, if not actually quite the\r\noldest, of domesticated plants--that it has all but lost the original\r\nhabit of producing seeds. This is a common effect of cultivation on\r\nfruits, and it is of course deliberately aimed at by horticulturists, as\r\nthe seeds are generally a nuisance, regarded from the point of view of\r\nthe eater, and their absence improves the fruit, as long as one can\r\nmanage to get along somehow without them. In the pretty little\r\nTangierine oranges (so ingeniously corrupted by fruiterers into\r\nmandarins) the seeds have almost been cultivated out; in the best\r\npine-apples, and in the small grapes known in the dried state as\r\ncurrants, they have quite disappeared; while in some varieties of pears\r\nthey survive only in the form of shrivelled, barren, and useless pips.\r\nBut the banana, more than any other plant we know of, has managed for\r\nmany centuries to do without seeds altogether. The cultivated sort,\r\nespecially in America, is quite seedless, and the plants are propagated\r\nentirely by suckers.\r\n\r\nStill, you can never wholly circumvent nature. Expel her with a\r\npitchfork, _tamen usque recurrit_. Now nature has settled that the right\r\nway to propagate plants is by means of seedlings. Strictly speaking,\r\nindeed, it is the only way; the other modes of growth from bulbs or\r\ncuttings are not really propagation, but mere reduplication by\r\nsplitting, as when you chop a worm in two, and a couple of worms wriggle\r\noff contentedly forthwith in either direction. Just so when you divide a\r\nplant by cuttings, suckers, slips, or runners; the two apparent plants\r\nthus produced are in the last resort only separate parts of the same\r\nindividual--one and indivisible, like the French Republic. Seedlings are\r\nabsolutely distinct individuals; they are the product of the pollen of\r\none plant and the ovules of another, and they start afresh in life with\r\nsome chance of being fairly free from the hereditary taints or personal\r\nfailings of either parent. But cuttings or suckers are only the same old\r\nplant over and over again in fresh circumstances, transplanted as it\r\nwere, but not truly renovated or rejuvenescent. That is the real reason\r\nwhy our potatoes are now all going to--well, the same place as the army\r\nhas been going ever since the earliest memories of the oldest officer in\r\nthe whole service. We have gone on growing potatoes over and over again\r\nfrom the tubers alone, and hardly ever from seed, till the whole\r\nconstitution of the potato kind has become permanently enfeebled by old\r\nage and dotage. The eyes (as farmers call them) are only buds or\r\nunderground branches; and to plant potatoes as we usually do is nothing\r\nmore than to multiply the apparent scions by fission. Odd as it may\r\nsound to say so, all the potato vines in a whole field are often, from\r\nthe strict biological point of view, parts of a single much-divided\r\nindividual. It is just as though one were to go on cutting up a single\r\nworm, time after time, as soon as he grew again, till at last the one\r\noriginal creature had multiplied into a whole colony of apparently\r\ndistinct individuals. Yet, if the first worm happened to have the gout\r\nor the rheumatism (metaphorically speaking), all the other worms into\r\nwhich his compound personality had been divided would doubtless suffer\r\nfrom the same complaints throughout the whole of their joint lifetimes.\r\n\r\nThe banana, however, has very long resisted the inevitable tendency to\r\ndegeneration in plants thus artificially and unhealthily propagated.\r\nPotatoes have only been in cultivation for a few hundred years; and yet\r\nthe potato constitution has become so far enfeebled by the practice of\r\ngrowing from the tuber that the plants now fall an easy prey to potato\r\nfungus, Colorado beetles, and a thousand other persistent enemies. It is\r\njust the same with the vine--propagated too long by layers or cuttings,\r\nits health has failed entirely, and it can no longer resist the ravages\r\nof the phylloxera or the slow attacks of the vine-disease fungus. But\r\nthe banana, though of very ancient and positively immemorial antiquity\r\nas a cultivated plant, seems somehow gifted with an extraordinary power\r\nof holding its own in spite of long-continued unnatural propagation. For\r\nthousands of years it has been grown in Asia in the seedless condition,\r\nand yet it springs as heartily as ever still from the underground\r\nsuckers. Nevertheless, there must in the end be some natural limit to\r\nthis wonderful power of reproduction, or rather of longevity; for, in\r\nthe strictest sense, the banana bushes that now grow in the negro\r\ngardens of Trinidad and Demerara are part and parcel of the very same\r\nplants which grew and bore fruit a thousand years ago in the native\r\ncompounds of the Malay Archipelago.\r\n\r\nIn fact, I think there can be but little doubt that the banana is the\r\nvery oldest product of human tillage. Man, we must remember, is\r\nessentially by origin a tropical animal, and wild tropical fruits must\r\nnecessarily have formed his earliest food-stuffs. It was among them of\r\ncourse that his first experiments in primitive agriculture would be\r\ntried; the little insignificant seeds and berries of cold northern\r\nregions would only very slowly be added to his limited stock in\r\nhusbandry, as circumstances pushed some few outlying colonies northward\r\nand ever northward toward the chillier unoccupied regions. Now, of all\r\ntropical fruits, the banana is certainly the one that best repays\r\ncultivation. It has been calculated that the same area which will\r\nproduce thirty-three pounds of wheat or ninety-nine pounds of potatoes\r\nwill produce 4,400 pounds of plantains or bananas. The cultivation of\r\nthe various varieties in India, China, and the Malay Archipelago dates,\r\nsays De Candolle, 'from an epoch impossible to realise.' Its diffusion,\r\nas that great but very oracular authority remarks, may go back to a\r\nperiod 'contemporary with or even anterior to that of the human races.'\r\nWhat this remarkably illogical sentence may mean I am at a loss to\r\ncomprehend; perhaps M. de Candolle supposes that the banana was\r\noriginally cultivated by pre-human gorillas; perhaps he merely intends\r\nto say that before men began to separate they sent special messengers on\r\nin front of them to diffuse the banana in the different countries they\r\nwere about to visit. Even legend retains some trace of the extreme\r\nantiquity of the species as a cultivated fruit, for Adam and Eve are\r\nsaid to have reclined under the shadow of its branches, whence Linnæus\r\ngave to the sort known as the plantain the Latin name of _Musa\r\nparadisiaca_. If a plant was cultivated in Eden by the grand old\r\ngardener and his wife, as Lord Tennyson democratically styled them\r\n(before his elevation to the peerage), we may fairly conclude that it\r\npossesses a very respectable antiquity indeed.\r\n\r\nThe wild banana is a native of the Malay region, according to De\r\nCandolle, who has produced by far the most learned and unreadable work\r\non the origin of domestic plants ever yet written. (Please don't give me\r\nundue credit for having heroically read it through out of pure love of\r\nscience: I was one of its unfortunate reviewers.) The wild form produces\r\nseed, and grows in Cochin China, the Philippines, Ceylon, and Khasia.\r\nLike most other large tropical fruits, it no doubt owes its original\r\ndevelopment to the selective action of monkeys, hornbills, parrots and\r\nother big fruit-eaters; and it shares with all fruits of similar origin\r\none curious tropical peculiarity. Most northern berries, like the\r\nstrawberry, the raspberry, the currant, and the blackberry, developed\r\nby the selective action of small northern birds, can be popped at once\r\ninto the mouth and eaten whole; they have no tough outer rind or\r\ndefensive covering of any sort. But big tropical fruits, which lay\r\nthemselves out for the service of large birds or monkeys, have always\r\nhard outer coats, because they could only be injured by smaller animals,\r\nwho would eat the pulp without helping in the dispersion of the useful\r\nseeds, the one object really held in view by the mother plant. Often, as\r\nin the case of the orange, the rind even contains a bitter, nauseous, or\r\npungent juice, while at times, as in the pine-apple, the prickly pear,\r\nthe sweet-sop, and the cherimoyer, the entire fruit is covered with\r\nsharp projections, stinging hairs, or knobby protuberances, on purpose\r\nto warn off the unauthorised depredator. It was this line of defence\r\nthat gave the banana in the first instance its thick yellow skin; and,\r\nlooking at the matter from the epicure's point of view, one may say\r\nroughly that all tropical fruits have to be skinned before they can be\r\neaten. They are all adapted for being cut up with a knife and fork, or\r\ndug out with a spoon, on a civilised dessert-plate. As for that most\r\ndelicious of Indian fruits, the mango, it has been well said that the\r\nonly proper way to eat it is over a tub of water, with a couple of\r\ntowels hanging gracefully across the side.\r\n\r\nThe varieties of the banana are infinite in number, and, as in most\r\nother plants of ancient cultivation, they shade off into one another by\r\ninfinitesimal gradations. Two principal sorts, however, are commonly\r\nrecognised--the true banana of commerce, and the common plantain. The\r\nbanana proper is eaten raw, as a fruit, and is allowed accordingly to\r\nripen thoroughly before being picked for market; the plantain, which is\r\nthe true food-stuff of all the equatorial region in both hemispheres, is\r\ngathered green and roasted as a vegetable, or, to use the more\r\nexpressive West Indian negro phrase, as a bread-kind. Millions of human\r\nbeings in Asia, Africa, America, and the islands of the Pacific Ocean\r\nlive almost entirely on the mild and succulent but tasteless plantain.\r\nSome people like the fruit; to me personally it is more suggestive of a\r\nvery flavourless over-ripe pear than of anything else in heaven or earth\r\nor the waters that are under the earth--the latter being the most\r\nprobable place to look for it, as its taste and substance are decidedly\r\nwatery. Baked dry in the green state 'it resembles roasted chestnuts,'\r\nor rather baked parsnip; pulped and boiled with water it makes 'a very\r\nagreeable sweet soup,' almost as nice as peasoup with brown sugar in it;\r\nand cut into slices, sweetened, and fried, it forms 'an excellent\r\nsubstitute for fruit pudding,' having a flavour much like that of\r\npotatoes _à la maítre d'hótel_ served up in treacle.\r\n\r\nAltogether a fruit to be sedulously avoided, the plantain, though\r\nmillions of our spiritually destitute African brethren haven't yet for a\r\nmoment discovered that it isn't every bit as good as wheaten bread and\r\nfresh butter. Missionary enterprise will no doubt before long enlighten\r\nthem on this subject, and create a good market in time for American\r\nflour and Manchester piece-goods.\r\n\r\nThough by origin a Malayan plant, there can be little doubt that the\r\nbanana had already reached the mainland of America and the West India\r\nIslands long before the voyage of Columbus. When Pizarro disembarked\r\nupon the coast of Peru on his desolating expedition, the mild-eyed,\r\nmelancholy, doomed Peruvians flocked down to the shore and offered him\r\nbananas in a lordly dish. Beds composed of banana leaves have been\r\ndiscovered in the tombs of the Incas, of date anterior, of course, to\r\nthe Spanish conquest. How did they get there? Well, it is clearly an\r\nabsurd mistake to suppose that Columbus discovered America; as Artemus\r\nWard pertinently remarked, the noble Red Indian had obviously discovered\r\nit long before him. There had been intercourse of old, too, between Asia\r\nand the Western Continent; the elephant-headed god of Mexico, the\r\ndebased traces of Buddhism in the Aztec religion, the singular\r\ncoincidences between India and Peru, all seem to show that a stream of\r\ncommunication, however faint, once existed between the Asiatic and\r\nAmerican worlds. Garcilaso himself, the half-Indian historian of Peru,\r\nsays that the banana was well known in his native country before the\r\nconquest, and that the Indians say 'its origin is Ethiopia.' In some\r\nstrange way or other, then, long before Columbus set foot upon the low\r\nsandbank of Cat's Island, the banana had been transported from Africa or\r\nIndia to the Western hemisphere.\r\n\r\nIf it were a plant propagated by seed, one would suppose that it was\r\ncarried across by wind or waves, wafted on the feet of birds, or\r\naccidentally introduced in the crannies of drift timber. So the coco-nut\r\nmade the tour of the world ages before either of the famous Cooks--the\r\nCaptain or the excursion agent--had rendered the same feat easy and\r\npracticable; and so, too, a number of American plants have fixed their\r\nhome in the tarns of the Hebrides or among the lonely bogs of Western\r\nGalway. But the banana must have been carried by man, because it is\r\nunknown in the wild state in the Western Continent; and, as it is\r\npractically seedless, it can only have been transported entire, in the\r\nform of a root or sucker. An exactly similar proof of ancient\r\nintercourse between the two worlds is afforded us by the sweet potato, a\r\nplant of undoubted American origin, which was nevertheless naturalised\r\nin China as early as the first centuries of the Christian era. Now that\r\nwe all know how the Scandinavians of the eleventh century went to\r\nMassachusetts, which they called Vineland, and how the Mexican empire\r\nhad some knowledge of Accadian astronomy, people are beginning to\r\ndiscover that Columbus himself was after all an egregious humbug.\r\n\r\nIn the old world the cultivation of the banana and the plantain goes\r\nback, no doubt, to a most immemorial antiquity. Our Aryan ancestor\r\nhimself, Professor Max Müller's especial _protégé_, had already invented\r\nseveral names for it, which duly survive in very classical Sanskrit. The\r\nGreeks of Alexander's expedition saw it in India, where 'sages reposed\r\nbeneath its shade and ate of its fruit, whence the botanical name, _Musa\r\nsapientum_.' As the sages in question were lazy Brahmans, always\r\ncelebrated for their immense capacity for doing nothing, the report, as\r\nquoted by Pliny, is no doubt an accurate one. But the accepted\r\nderivation of the word _Musa_ from an Arabic original seems to me highly\r\nuncertain; for Linnæus, who first bestowed it on the genus, called\r\nseveral other allied genera by such cognate names as Urania and\r\nHeliconia. If, therefore, the father of botany knew that his own word\r\nwas originally Arabic, we cannot acquit him of the high crime and\r\nmisdemeanour of deliberate punning. Should the Royal Society get wind of\r\nthis, something serious would doubtless happen; for it is well known\r\nthat the possession of a sense of humour is absolutely fatal to the\r\npretensions of a man of science.\r\n\r\nBesides its main use as an article of food, the banana serves\r\nincidentally to supply a valuable fibre, obtained from the stem, and\r\nemployed for weaving into textile fabrics and making paper. Several\r\nkinds of the plantain tribe are cultivated for this purpose exclusively,\r\nthe best known among them being the so-called manilla hemp, a plant\r\nlargely grown in the Philippine Islands. Many of the finest Indian\r\nshawls are woven from banana stems, and much of the rope that we use in\r\nour houses comes from the same singular origin. I know nothing more\r\nstrikingly illustrative of the extreme complexity of our modern\r\ncivilisation than the way in which we thus every day employ articles of\r\nexotic manufacture in our ordinary life without ever for a moment\r\nsuspecting or inquiring into their true nature. What lady knows when she\r\nputs on her delicate wrapper, from Liberty's or from Swan and Edgar's,\r\nthat the material from which it is woven is a Malayan plantain stalk?\r\nWho ever thinks that the glycerine for our chapped hands comes from\r\nTravancore coco-nuts, and that the pure butter supplied us from the farm\r\nin the country is coloured yellow with Jamaican annatto? We break a\r\ntooth, as Mr. Herbert Spencer has pointed out, because the grape-curers\r\nof Zante are not careful enough about excluding small stones from their\r\nstock of currants; and we suffer from indigestion because the Cape\r\nwine-grower has doctored his light Burgundies with Brazilian logwood and\r\nwhite rum, to make them taste like Portuguese port. Take merely this\r\nvery question of dessert, and how intensely complicated it really is.\r\nThe West Indian bananas keep company with sweet St. Michaels from the\r\nAzores, and with Spanish cobnuts from Barcelona. Dried fruits from Metz,\r\nfigs from Smyrna, and dates from Tunis lie side by side on our table\r\nwith Brazil nuts and guava jelly and damson cheese and almonds and\r\nraisins. We forget where everything comes from nowadays, in our general\r\nconsciousness that they all come from the Queen Victoria Street Stores,\r\nand any real knowledge of common objects is rendered every day more and\r\nmore impossible by the bewildering complexity and variety, every day\r\nincreasing, of the common objects themselves, their substitutes,\r\nadulterates, and spurious imitations. Why, you probably never heard of\r\nmanilla hemp before, until this very minute, and yet you have been\r\nfamiliarly using it all your lifetime, while 400,000 hundredweights of\r\nthat useful article are annually imported into this country alone. It is\r\nan interesting study to take any day a list of market quotations, and\r\nask oneself about every material quoted, what it is and what they do\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\nFor example, can you honestly pretend that you really understand the use\r\nand importance of that valuable object of everyday demand, fustic? I\r\nremember an ill-used telegraph clerk in a tropical colony once\r\ncomplaining to me that English cable operators were so disgracefully\r\nignorant about this important staple as invariably to substitute for its\r\nname the word 'justice' in all telegrams which originally referred to\r\nit. Have you any clear and definite notions as to the prime origin and\r\nfinal destination of a thing called jute, in whose sole manufacture the\r\nwhole great and flourishing town of Dundee lives and moves and has its\r\nbeing? What is turmeric? Whence do we obtain vanilla? How many\r\ncommercial products are yielded by the orchids? How many totally\r\ndistinct plants in different countries afford the totally distinct\r\nstarches lumped together in grocers' lists under the absurd name of\r\narrowroot? When you ask for sago do you really see that you get it? and\r\nhow many entirely different objects described as sago are known to\r\ncommerce? Define the uses of partridge canes and cohune oil. What\r\nobjects are generally manufactured from tucum? Would it surprise you to\r\nlearn that English door-handles are commonly made out of coquilla nuts?\r\nthat your wife's buttons are turned from the indurated fruit of the\r\nTagua palm? and that the knobs of umbrellas grew originally in the\r\nremote depths of Guatemalan forests? Are you aware that a plant called\r\nmanioc supplies the starchy food of about one-half the population of\r\ntropical America? These are the sort of inquiries with which a new\r\nedition of 'Mangnall's Questions' would have to be filled; and as to\r\nanswering them--why, even the pupil-teachers in a London Board School\r\n(who represent, I suppose, the highest attainable level of human\r\nknowledge) would often find themselves completely nonplussed. The fact\r\nis, tropical trade has opened out so rapidly and so wonderfully that\r\nnobody knows much about the chief articles of tropical growth; we go on\r\nusing them in an uninquiring spirit of childlike faith, much as the\r\nJamaica negroes go on using articles of European manufacture about whose\r\norigin they are so ridiculously ignorant that one young woman once asked\r\nme whether it was really true that cotton handkerchiefs were dug up out\r\nof the ground over in England. Some dim confusion between coal or iron\r\nand Manchester piece-goods seemed to have taken firm possession of her\r\ninfantile imagination.\r\n\r\nThat is why I have thought that a treatise De Banana might not, perhaps,\r\nbe wholly without its usefulness to the modern English reading world.\r\nAfter all, a food-stuff which supports hundreds of millions among our\r\nbeloved tropical fellow-creatures ought to be very dear to the heart of\r\na nation which governs (and annually kills) more black people, taken in\r\nthe mass, than all the other European powers put together. We have\r\nintroduced the blessings of British rule--the good and well-paid\r\nmissionary, the Remington rifle, the red-cotton pocket-handkerchief, and\r\nthe use of 'the liquor called rum'--into so many remote corners of the\r\ntropical world that it is high time we should begin in return to learn\r\nsomewhat about fetiches and fustic, Jamaica and jaggery, bananas and\r\nBuddhism. We know too little still about our colonies and dependencies.\r\n'Cape Breton an island!' cried King George's Minister, the Duke of\r\nNewcastle, in the well-known story, 'Cape Breton an island! Why, so it\r\nis! God bless my soul! I must go and tell the King that Cape Breton's\r\nan island.' That was a hundred years ago; but only the other day the\r\nBoard of Trade placarded all our towns and villages with a flaming\r\nnotice to the effect that the Colorado beetle had made its appearance at\r\n'a town in Canada called Ontario,' and might soon be expected to arrive\r\nat Liverpool by Cunard steamer. The right honourables and other high\r\nmightinesses who put forth the notice in question were evidently unaware\r\nthat Ontario is a province as big as England, including in its borders\r\nToronto, Ottawa, Kingston, London, Hamilton, and other large and\r\nflourishing towns. Apparently, in spite of competitive examinations, the\r\nschoolmaster is still abroad in the Government offices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGO TO THE ANT\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the market-place at Santa Fé, in Mexico, peasant women from the\r\nneighbouring villages bring in for sale trayfuls of living ants, each\r\nabout as big and round as a large white currant, and each entirely\r\nfilled with honey or grape sugar, much appreciated by the ingenuous\r\nMexican youth as an excellent substitute for Everton toffee. The method\r\nof eating them would hardly command the approbation of the Society for\r\nthe Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. It is simple and primitive, but\r\ndecidedly not humane. Ingenuous youth holds the ant by its head and\r\nshoulders, sucks out the honey with which the back part is absurdly\r\ndistended, and throws away the empty body as a thing with which it has\r\nnow no further sympathy. Maturer age buys the ants by the quart, presses\r\nout the honey through a muslin strainer, and manufactures it into a very\r\nsweet intoxicating drink, something like shandygaff, as I am credibly\r\ninformed by bold persons who have ventured to experiment upon it, taken\r\ninternally.\r\n\r\nThe curious insect which thus serves as an animated sweetmeat for the\r\nMexican children is the honey-ant of the Garden of the Gods; and it\r\naffords a beautiful example of Mandeville's charming paradox that\r\npersonal vices are public benefits--_vitia privata humana commoda_. The\r\nhoney-ant is a greedy individual who has nevertheless nobly devoted\r\nhimself for the good of the community by converting himself into a\r\nliving honey-jar, from which all the other ants in his own nest may help\r\nthemselves freely from time to time, as occasion demands. The tribe to\r\nwhich he belongs lives underground, in a dome-roofed vault, and only one\r\nparticular caste among the workers, known as rotunds from their\r\nexpansive girth, is told off for this special duty of storing honey\r\nwithin their own bodies. Clinging to the top of their nest, with their\r\nround, transparent abdomens hanging down loosely, mere globules of skin\r\nenclosing the pale amber-coloured honey, these Daniel Lamberts of the\r\ninsect race look for all the world like clusters of the little American\r\nDelaware grapes, with an ant's legs and head stuck awkwardly on to the\r\nend instead of a stalk. They have, in fact, realised in everyday life\r\nthe awful fate of Mr. Gilbert's discontented sugar-broker, who laid on\r\nflesh and 'adipose deposit' until he became converted at last into a\r\nperfect rolling ball of globular humanity.\r\n\r\nThe manners of the honey-ant race are very simple. Most of the members\r\nof each community are active and roving in their dispositions, and show\r\nno tendency to undue distension of the nether extremities. They go out\r\nat night and collect nectar or honey-dew from the gall-insects on\r\noak-trees; for the gall-insect, like love in the old Latin saw, is\r\nfruitful both in sweets and bitters, _melle et felle_. This nectar they\r\nthen carry home, and give it to the rotunds or honey-bearers, who\r\nswallow it and store it in their round abdomen until they can hold no\r\nmore, having stretched their skins literally to the very point of\r\nbursting. They pass their time, like the Fat Boy in 'Pickwick,' chiefly\r\nin sleeping, but they cling upside down meanwhile to the roof of their\r\nresidence. When the workers in turn require a meal, they go up to the\r\nnearest honey-bearer and stroke her gently with their antennæ. The\r\nhoney-bearer thereupon throws up her head and regurgitates a large drop\r\nof the amber liquid. ('Regurgitates' is a good word which I borrow from\r\nDr. McCook, of Philadelphia, the great authority upon honey-ants; and it\r\nsaves an immense deal of trouble in looking about for a respectable\r\nperiphrasis.) The workers feed upon the drops thus exuded, two or three\r\nat once often standing around the living honey-jar, and lapping nectar\r\ntogether from the lips of their devoted comrade. This may seem at first\r\nsight rather an unpleasant practice on the part of the ants; but after\r\nall, how does it really differ from our own habit of eating honey which\r\nhas been treated in very much the same unsophisticated manner by the\r\ndomestic bee?\r\n\r\nWorse things than these, however, Dr. McCook records to the discredit of\r\nthe Colorado honey-ant. When he was opening some nests in the Garden of\r\nthe Gods, he happened accidentally to knock down some of the rotunds,\r\nwhich straightway burst asunder in the middle, and scattered their store\r\nof honey on the floor of the nest. At once the other ants, tempted away\r\nfrom their instinctive task of carrying off the cocoons and young grubs,\r\nclustered around their unfortunate companion, like street boys around a\r\nbroken molasses barrel, and, instead of forming themselves forthwith\r\ninto a volunteer ambulance company, proceeded immediately to lap up the\r\nhoney from their dying brother. On the other hand it must be said, to\r\nthe credit of the race, that (unlike the members of Arctic expeditions)\r\nthey never desecrate the remains of the dead. When a honey-bearer dies\r\nat his post, a victim to his zeal for the common good, the workers\r\ncarefully remove his cold corpse from the roof where it still clings,\r\nclip off the head and shoulders from the distended abdomen, and convey\r\ntheir deceased brother piecemeal, in two detachments, to the formican\r\ncemetery, undisturbed. If they chose, they might only bury the front\r\nhalf of their late relation, while they retained his remaining moiety\r\nas an available honey-bag: but from this cannibal proceeding\r\nant-etiquette recoils in decent horror; and the amber globes are 'pulled\r\nup galleries, rolled along rooms, and bowled into the graveyard, along\r\nwith the juiceless heads, legs, and other members.' Such fraternal\r\nconduct would be very creditable to the worker honey-ants, were it not\r\nfor a horrid doubt insinuated by Dr. McCook that perhaps the insects\r\ndon't know they could get at the honey by breaking up the body of their\r\nlamented relative. If so, their apparent disregard of utilitarian\r\nconsiderations may really be due not to their sentimentality but to\r\ntheir hopeless stupidity.\r\n\r\nThe reason why the ants have taken thus to storing honey in the living\r\nbodies of their own fellows is easy enough to understand. They want to\r\nlay up for the future like prudent insects that they are; but they can't\r\nmake wax, as the bees do, and they have not yet evolved the purely human\r\nart of pottery. Consequently--happy thought--why not tell off some of\r\nour number to act as jars on behalf of the others? Some of the community\r\nwork by going out and gathering honey; they also serve who only stand\r\nand wait--who receive it from the workers, and keep it stored up in\r\ntheir own capacious indiarubber maws till further notice. So obvious is\r\nthis plan for converting ants into animated honey-jars, that several\r\ndifferent kinds of ants in different parts of the world, belonging to\r\nthe most widely distinct families, have independently hit upon the very\r\nself-same device. Besides the Mexican species, there is a totally\r\ndifferent Australian honey-ant, and another equally separate in Borneo\r\nand Singapore. This last kind does not store the honey in the hind part\r\nof the body technically known as the abdomen, but in the middle division\r\nwhich naturalists call the thorax, where it forms a transparent\r\nbladder-like swelling, and makes the creature look as though it were\r\nsuffering with an acute attack of dropsy. In any case, the life of a\r\nhoney-bearer must be singularly uneventful, not to say dull and\r\nmonotonous; but no doubt any small inconvenience in this respect must be\r\nmore than compensated for by the glorious consciousness that one is\r\nsacrificing one's own personal comfort for the common good of universal\r\nanthood. Perhaps, however, the ants have not yet reached the Positivist\r\nstage, and may be totally ignorant of the enthusiasm of formicity.\r\n\r\nEqually curious are the habits and manners of the harvesting ants, the\r\nspecies which Solomon seems to have had specially in view when he\r\nadvised his hearers to go to the ant--a piece of advice which I have\r\nalso adopted as the title of the present article, though I by no means\r\nintend thereby to insinuate that the readers of this volume ought\r\nproperly to be classed as sluggards. These industrious little creatures\r\nabound in India: they are so small that it takes eight or ten of them to\r\ncarry a single grain of wheat or barley; and yet they will patiently\r\ndrag along their big burden for five hundred or a thousand yards to the\r\ndoor of their formicary. To prevent the grain from germinating, they\r\nbite off the embryo root--a piece of animal intelligence outdone by\r\nanother species of ant, which actually allows the process of budding to\r\nbegin, so as to produce sugar, as in malting. After the last\r\nthunderstorms of the monsoon the little proprietors bring up all the\r\ngrain from their granaries to dry in the tropical sunshine. The quantity\r\nof grain stored up by the harvesting ants is often so large that the\r\nhair-splitting Jewish casuists of the Mishna have seriously discussed\r\nthe question whether it belongs to the landowner or may lawfully be\r\nappropriated by the gleaners. 'They do not appear,' says Sir John\r\nLubbock, 'to have considered the rights of the ants.' Indeed our duty\r\ntowards insects is a question which seems hitherto to have escaped the\r\nnotice of all moral philosophers. Even Mr. Herbert Spencer, the prophet\r\nof individualism, has never taken exception to our gross disregard of\r\nthe proprietary rights of bees in their honey, or of silkworms in their\r\ncocoons. There are signs, however, that the obtuse human conscience is\r\nawakening in this respect; for when Dr. Loew suggested to bee-keepers\r\nthe desirability of testing the commercial value of honey-ants, as\r\nrivals to the bee, Dr. McCook replied that 'the sentiment against the\r\nuse of honey thus taken from living insects, which is worthy of all\r\nrespect, would not be easily overcome.'\r\n\r\nThere are no harvesting ants in Northern Europe, though they extend as\r\nfar as Syria, Italy, and the Riviera, in which latter station I have\r\noften observed them busily working. What most careless observers take\r\nfor grain in the nests of English ants are of course really the cocoons\r\nof the pupæ. For many years, therefore, entomologists were under the\r\nimpression that Solomon had fallen into this popular error, and that\r\nwhen he described the ant as 'gathering her food in the harvest' and\r\n'preparing her meat in the summer,' he was speaking rather as a poet\r\nthan as a strict naturalist. Later observations, however, have\r\nvindicated the general accuracy of the much-married king by showing that\r\ntrue harvesting ants do actually occur in Syria, and that they lay by\r\nstores for the winter in the very way stated by that early entomologist,\r\nwhose knowledge of 'creeping things' is specially enumerated in the long\r\nlist of his universal accomplishments.\r\n\r\nDr. Lincecum of Texan fame has even improved upon Solomon by his\r\ndiscovery of those still more interesting and curious creatures, the\r\nagricultural ants of Texas. America is essentially a farming country,\r\nand the agricultural ants are born farmers. They make regular clearings\r\naround their nests, and on these clearings they allow nothing to grow\r\nexcept a particular kind of grain, known as ant-rice. Dr. Lincecum\r\nmaintains that the tiny farmers actually sow and cultivate the ant-rice.\r\nDr. McCook, on the other hand, is of opinion that the rice sows itself,\r\nand that the insects' part is limited to preventing any other plants or\r\nweeds from encroaching on the appropriated area. In any case, be they\r\nsquatters or planters, it is certain that the rice, when ripe, is duly\r\nharvested, and that it is, to say the least, encouraged by the ants, to\r\nthe exclusion of all other competitors. 'After the maturing and\r\nharvesting of the seed,' says Dr. Lincecum, 'the dry stubble is cut away\r\nand removed from the pavement, which is thus left fallow until the\r\nensuing autumn, when the same species of grass, and in the same circle,\r\nappears again, and receives the same agricultural care as did the\r\nprevious crop.' Sir John Lubbock, indeed, goes so far as to say that the\r\nthree stages of human progress--the hunter, the herdsman, and the\r\nagriculturist--are all to be found among various species of existing\r\nants.\r\n\r\nThe Saüba ants of tropical America carry their agricultural operations a\r\nstep further. Dwelling in underground nests, they sally forth upon the\r\ntrees, and cut out of the leaves large round pieces, about as big as a\r\nshilling. These pieces they drop upon the ground, where another\r\ndetachment is in waiting to convey them to the galleries of the nest.\r\nThere they store enormous quantities of these round pieces, which they\r\nallow to decay in the dark, so as to form a sort of miniature mushroom\r\nbed. On the mouldering vegetable heap they have thus piled up, they\r\ninduce a fungus to grow, and with this fungus they feed their young\r\ngrubs during their helpless infancy. Mr. Belt, the 'Naturalist in\r\nNicaragua,' found that native trees suffered far less from their\r\ndepredations than imported ones. The ants hardly touched the local\r\nforests, but they stripped young plantations of orange, coffee, and\r\nmango trees stark naked. He ingeniously accounts for this curious fact\r\nby supposing that an internecine struggle has long been going on in the\r\ncountries inhabited by the Saübas between the ants and the forest trees.\r\nThose trees that best resisted the ants, owing either to some unpleasant\r\ntaste or to hardness of foliage, have in the long run survived\r\ndestruction; but those which were suited for the purpose of the ants\r\nhave been reduced to nonentity, while the ants in turn were getting\r\nslowly adapted to attack other trees. In this way almost all the native\r\ntrees have at last acquired some special means of protection against the\r\nravages of the leaf-cutters; so that they immediately fall upon all\r\nimported and unprotected kinds as their natural prey. This ingenious and\r\nwholly satisfactory explanation must of course go far to console the\r\nBrazilian planters for the frequent loss of their orange and coffee\r\ncrops.\r\n\r\nMr. Alfred Russel Wallace, the co-discoverer of the Darwinian theory\r\n(whose honours he waived with rare generosity in favour of the older and\r\nmore distinguished naturalist), tells a curious story about the\r\npredatory habits of these same Saübas. On one occasion, when he was\r\nwandering about in search of specimens on the Rio Negro, he bought a\r\npeck of rice, which was tied up, Indian fashion, in the local bandanna\r\nof the happy plantation slave. At night he left his rice incautiously on\r\nthe bench of the hut where he was sleeping; and next morning the Saübas\r\nhad riddled the handkerchief like a sieve, and carried away a gallon of\r\nthe grain for their own felonious purposes. The underground galleries\r\nwhich they dig can often be traced for hundreds of yards; and Mr. Hamlet\r\nClarke even asserts that in one case they have tunnelled under the bed\r\nof a river where it is a quarter of a mile wide. This beats Brunel on\r\nhis own ground into the proverbial cocked hat, both for depth and\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nWithin doors, in the tropics, ants are apt to put themselves obtrusively\r\nforward in a manner little gratifying to any except the enthusiastically\r\nentomological mind. The winged females, after their marriage flight,\r\nhave a disagreeable habit of flying in at the open doors and windows at\r\nlunch time, settling upon the table like the Harpies in the Æneid, and\r\nthen quietly shuffling off their wings one at a time, by holding them\r\ndown against the table-cloth with one leg, and running away vigorously\r\nwith the five others. As soon as they have thus disembarrassed\r\nthemselves of their superfluous members, they proceed to run about over\r\nthe lunch as if the house belonged to them, and to make a series of\r\nexperiments upon the edible qualities of the different dishes. One\r\ndoesn't so much mind their philosophical inquiries into the nature of\r\nthe bread or even the meat; but when they come to drowning themselves by\r\ndozens, in the pursuit of knowledge, in the soup and sherry, one feels\r\nbound to protest energetically against the spirit of martyrdom by which\r\nthey are too profoundly animated. That is one of the slight drawbacks of\r\nthe realms of perpetual summer; in the poets you see only one side of\r\nthe picture--the palms, the orchids, the humming-birds, the great\r\ntrailing lianas: in practical life you see the reverse side--the\r\nthermometer at 98°, the tepid drinking-water, the prickly heat, the\r\nperpetual languor, the endless shoals of aggressive insects. A lady of\r\nmy acquaintance, indeed, made a valuable entomological collection in her\r\nown dining-room, by the simple process of consigning to pill-boxes all\r\nthe moths and flies and beetles that settled upon the mangoes and\r\nstar-apples in the course of dessert.\r\n\r\nAnother objectionable habit of the tropical ants, viewed practically,\r\nis their total disregard of vested interests in the case of house\r\nproperty. Like Mr. George and his communistic friends, they disbelieve\r\nentirely in the principle of private rights in real estate. They will\r\neat their way through the beams of your house till there is only a\r\nslender core of solid wood left to support the entire burden. I have\r\ntaken down a rafter in my own house in Jamaica, originally 18 inches\r\nthick each way, with a sound circular centre of no more than 6 inches in\r\ndiameter, upon which all the weight necessarily fell. With the material\r\nextracted from the wooden beams they proceed to add insult to injury by\r\nbuilding long covered galleries right across the ceiling of your\r\ndrawing-room. As may be easily imagined, these galleries do not tend to\r\nimprove the appearance of the ceiling; and it becomes necessary to form\r\na Liberty and Property Defence League for the protection of one's\r\npersonal interests against the insect enemy. I have no objection to ants\r\nbuilding galleries on their own freehold, or even to their nationalising\r\nthe land in their native forests; but I do object strongly to their\r\nunwarrantable intrusion upon the domain of private life. Expostulation\r\nand active warfare, however, are equally useless. The carpenter-ant has\r\nno moral sense, and is not amenable either to kindness or blows. On one\r\noccasion, when a body of these intrusive creatures had constructed an\r\nabsurdly conspicuous brown gallery straight across the ceiling of my\r\ndrawing-room, I determined to declare open war against them, and,\r\ngetting my black servant to bring in the steps and a mop, I proceeded to\r\ndemolish the entire gallery just after breakfast. It was about 20 feet\r\nlong, as well as I can remember, and perhaps an inch in diameter. At one\r\no'clock I returned to lunch. My black servant pointed, with a broad grin\r\non his intelligent features, to the wooden ceiling. I looked up; in\r\nthose three hours the carpenter-ants had reconstructed the entire\r\ngallery, and were doubtless mocking me at their ease, with their\r\nuplifted antennæ, under that safe shelter. I retired at once from the\r\nunequal contest. It was clearly impossible to go on knocking down a\r\nfresh gallery every three hours of the day or night throughout a whole\r\nlifetime.\r\n\r\nAnts, says Mr. Wallace, without one touch of satire, 'force themselves\r\nupon the attention of everyone who visits the tropics.' They do, indeed,\r\nand that most pungently; if by no other method, at least by the simple\r\nand effectual one of stinging. The majority of ants in every nest are of\r\ncourse neuters, or workers, that is to say, strictly speaking,\r\nundeveloped females, incapable of laying eggs. But they still retain the\r\novipositor, which is converted into a sting, and supplied with a\r\npoisonous liquid to eject afterwards into the wound. So admirably\r\nadapted to its purpose is this beautiful provision of nature, that some\r\ntropical ants can sting with such violence as to make your leg swell and\r\nconfine you for some days to your room; while cases have even been known\r\nin which the person attacked has fainted with pain, or had a serious\r\nattack of fever in consequence. It is not every kind of ant, however,\r\nthat can sting; a great many can only bite with their little hard horny\r\njaws, and then eject a drop of formic poison afterwards into the hole\r\ncaused by the bite. The distinction is a delicate physiological one, not\r\nmuch appreciated by the victims of either mode of attack. The perfect\r\nfemales can also sting, but not, of course, the males, who are poor,\r\nwretched, useless creatures, only good as husbands for the community,\r\nand dying off as soon as they have performed their part in the\r\nworld--another beautiful provision, which saves the workers the trouble\r\nof killing them off, as bees do with drones after the marriage flight of\r\nthe queen bee.\r\n\r\nThe blind driver-ants of West Africa are among the very few species\r\nthat render any service to man, and that, of course, only incidentally.\r\nUnlike most other members of their class, the driver-ants have no\r\nsettled place of residence; they are vagabonds and wanderers upon the\r\nface of the earth, formican tramps, blind beggars, who lead a gipsy\r\nexistence, and keep perpetually upon the move, smelling their way\r\ncautiously from one camping-place to another. They march by night, or on\r\ncloudy days, like wise tropical strategists, and never expose themselves\r\nto the heat of the day in broad sunshine, as though they were no better\r\nthan the mere numbered British Tommy Atkins at Coomassie or in the\r\nSoudan. They move in vast armies across country, driving everything\r\nbefore them as they go; for they belong to the stinging division, and\r\nare very voracious in their personal habits. Not only do they eat up the\r\ninsects in their line of march, but they fall even upon larger creatures\r\nand upon big snakes, which they attack first in the eyes, the most\r\nvulnerable portion. When they reach a negro village the inhabitants turn\r\nout _en masse_, and run away, exactly as if the visitors were English\r\nexplorers or brave Marines, bent upon retaliating for the theft of a\r\nknife by nobly burning down King Tom's town or King Jumbo's capital.\r\nThen the negroes wait in the jungle till the little black army has\r\npassed on, after clearing out the huts by the way of everything eatable.\r\nWhen they return they find their calabashes and saucepans licked clean,\r\nbut they also find every rat, mouse, lizard, cockroach, gecko, and\r\nbeetle completely cleared out from the whole village. Most of them have\r\ncut and run at the first approach of the drivers; of the remainder, a\r\nfew blanched and neatly-picked skeletons alone remain to tell the tale.\r\n\r\nAs I wish to be considered a veracious historian, I will not retail the\r\nfurther strange stories that still find their way into books of natural\r\nhistory about the manners and habits of these blind marauders. They\r\ncross rivers, the West African gossips declare, by a number of devoted\r\nindividuals flinging themselves first into the water as a living bridge,\r\nlike so many six-legged Marcus Curtiuses, while over their drowning\r\nbodies the heedless remainder march in safety to the other side. If the\r\nstory is not true, it is at least well invented; for the\r\nant-commonwealth everywhere carries to the extremest pitch the old Roman\r\ndoctrine of the absolute subjection of the individual to the State. So\r\nexactly is this the case that in some species there are a few large,\r\novergrown, lazy ants in each nest, which do no work themselves, but\r\naccompany the workers on their expeditions; and the sole use of these\r\nidle mouths seems to be to attract the attention of birds and other\r\nenemies, and so distract it from the useful workers, the mainstay of the\r\nentire community. It is almost as though an army, marching against a\r\ntribe of cannibals, were to place itself in the centre of a hollow\r\nsquare formed of all the fattest people in the country, whose fine\r\ncondition and fitness for killing might immediately engross the\r\nattention of the hungry enemy. Ants, in fact, have, for the most part,\r\nalready reached the goal set before us as a delightful one by most\r\ncurrent schools of socialist philosophers, in which the individual is\r\nabsolutely sacrificed in every way to the needs of the community.\r\n\r\nThe most absurdly human, however, among all the tricks and habits of\r\nants are their well known cattle-farming and slaveholding instincts.\r\nEverybody has heard, of course, how they keep the common rose-blight as\r\nmilch cows, and suck from them the sweet honey-dew. But everybody,\r\nprobably, does not yet know the large number of insects which they herd\r\nin one form or another as domesticated animals. Man has, at most, some\r\ntwenty or thirty such, including cows, sheep, horses, donkeys, camels,\r\nllamas, alpacas, reindeer, dogs, cats, canaries, pigs, fowl, ducks,\r\ngeese, turkeys, and silkworms. But ants have hundreds and hundreds, some\r\nof them kept obviously for purposes of food; others apparently as pets;\r\nand yet others again, as has been plausibly suggested, by reason of\r\nsuperstition or as objects of worship. There is a curious blind beetle\r\nwhich inhabits ants' nests, and is so absolutely dependent upon its\r\nhosts for support that it has even lost the power of feeding itself. It\r\nnever quits the nest, but the ants bring it in food and supply it by\r\nputting the nourishment actually into its mouth. But the beetle, in\r\nreturn, seems to secrete a sweet liquid (or it may even be a stimulant\r\nlike beer, or a narcotic like tobacco) in a tuft of hairs near the\r\nbottom of the hard wing-cases, and the ants often lick this tuft with\r\nevery appearance of satisfaction and enjoyment. In this case, and in\r\nmany others, there can be no doubt that the insects are kept for the\r\nsake of food or some other advantage yielded by them.\r\n\r\nBut there are other instances of insects which haunt ants' nests, which\r\nit is far harder to account for on any hypothesis save that of\r\nsuperstitious veneration. There is a little weevil that runs about by\r\nhundreds in the galleries of English ants, in and out among the free\r\ncitizens, making itself quite at home in their streets and public\r\nplaces, but as little noticed by the ants themselves as dogs are in our\r\nown cities. Then, again, there is a white woodlouse, something like the\r\ncommon little armadillo, but blind from having lived so long\r\nunderground, which walks up and down the lanes and alleys of antdom,\r\nwithout ever holding any communication of any sort with its hosts and\r\nneighbours. In neither case has Sir John Lubbock ever seen an ant take\r\nthe slightest notice of the presence of these strange fellow-lodgers.\r\n'One might almost imagine,' he says, 'that they had the cap of\r\ninvisibility.' Yet it is quite clear that the ants deliberately sanction\r\nthe residence of the weevils and woodlice in their nests, for any\r\nunauthorised intruder would immediately be set upon and massacred\r\noutright.\r\n\r\nSir John Lubbock suggests that they may perhaps be tolerated as\r\nscavengers: or, again, it is possible that they may prey upon the eggs\r\nor larvæ of some of the parasites to whose attacks the ants are subject.\r\nIn the first case, their use would be similar to that of the wild dogs\r\nin Constantinople or the common black John-crow vultures in tropical\r\nAmerica: in the second case, they would be about equivalent to our own\r\ncats or to the hedgehog often put in farmhouse kitchens to keep down\r\ncockroaches.\r\n\r\nThe crowning glory of owning slaves, which many philosophic Americans\r\n(before the war) showed to be the highest and noblest function of the\r\nmost advanced humanity, has been attained by more than one variety of\r\nanthood. Our great English horse-ant is a moderate slaveholder; but the\r\nbig red ant of Southern Europe carries the domestic institution many\r\nsteps further. It makes regular slave-raids upon the nests of the small\r\nbrown ants, and carries off the young in their pupa condition. By-and-by\r\nthe brown ants hatch out in the strange nest, and never having known any\r\nother life except that of slavery, accommodate themselves to it readily\r\nenough. The red ant, however, is still only an occasional slaveowner; if\r\nnecessary, he can get along by himself, without the aid of his little\r\nbrown servants. Indeed, there are free states and slave states of red\r\nants side by side with one another, as of old in Maryland and\r\nPennsylvania: in the first, the red ants do their work themselves, like\r\nmere vulgar Ohio farmers; in the second, they get their work done for\r\nthem by their industrious little brown servants, like the aristocratic\r\nfirst families of Virginia before the earthquake of emancipation.\r\n\r\nBut there are other degraded ants, whose life-history may be humbly\r\npresented to the consideration of the Anti-Slavery Society, as speaking\r\nmore eloquently than any other known fact for the demoralising effect of\r\nslaveowning upon the slaveholders themselves. The Swiss rufescent ant is\r\na species so long habituated to rely entirely upon the services of\r\nslaves that it is no longer able to manage its own affairs when deprived\r\nby man of its hereditary bondsmen. It has lost entirely the art of\r\nconstructing a nest; it can no longer tend its own young, whom it leaves\r\nentirely to the care of negro nurses; and its bodily structure even has\r\nchanged, for the jaws have lost their teeth, and have been converted\r\ninto mere nippers, useful only as weapons of war. The rufescent ant, in\r\nfact, is a purely military caste, which has devoted itself entirely to\r\nthe pursuit of arms, leaving every other form of activity to its slaves\r\nand dependents. Officers of the old school will be glad to learn that\r\nthis military insect is dressed, if not in scarlet, at any rate in very\r\ndecent red, and that it refuses to be bothered in any way with questions\r\nof transport or commissariat. If the community changes its nest, the\r\nmasters are carried on the backs of their slaves to the new position,\r\nand the black ants have to undertake the entire duty of foraging and\r\nbringing in stores of supply for their gentlemanly proprietors. Only\r\nwhen war is to be made upon neighbouring nests does the thin red line\r\nform itself into long file for active service. Nothing could be more\r\nperfectly aristocratic than the views of life entertained and acted upon\r\nby these distinguished slaveholders.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the picture has its reverse side, exhibiting clearly\r\nthe weak points of the slaveholding system. The rufescent ant has lost\r\neven the very power of feeding itself. So completely dependent is each\r\nupon his little black valet for daily bread, that he cannot so much as\r\nhelp himself to the food that is set before him. Hüber put a few\r\nslaveholders into a box with some of their own larvæ and pupæ, and a\r\nsupply of honey, in order to see what they would do with them. Appalled\r\nat the novelty of the situation, the slaveholders seemed to come to the\r\nconclusion that something must be done; so they began carrying the larvæ\r\nabout aimlessly in their mouths, and rushing up and down in search of\r\nthe servants. After a while, however, they gave it up and came to the\r\nconclusion that life under such circumstances was clearly intolerable.\r\nThey never touched the honey, but resigned themselves to their fate like\r\nofficers and gentlemen. In less than two days, half of them had died of\r\nhunger, rather than taste a dinner which was not supplied to them by a\r\nproperly constituted footman. Admiring their heroism or pitying their\r\nincapacity, Hüber at last gave them just one slave between them all. The\r\nplucky little negro, nothing daunted by the gravity of the situation,\r\nset to work at once, dug a small nest, gathered together the larvæ,\r\nhelped several pupæ out of the cocoon, and saved the lives of the\r\nsurviving slaveowners. Other naturalists have tried similar experiments,\r\nand always with the same result. The slaveowners will starve in the\r\nmidst of plenty rather than feed themselves without attendance. Either\r\nthey cannot or will not put the food into their own mouths with their\r\nown mandibles.\r\n\r\nThere are yet other ants, such as the workerless _Anergates_, in which\r\nthe degradation of slaveholding has gone yet further. These wretched\r\ncreatures are the formican representatives of those Oriental despots who\r\nare no longer even warlike, but are sunk in sloth and luxury, and pass\r\ntheir lives in eating bang or smoking opium. Once upon a time, Sir John\r\nLubbock thinks, the ancestors of _Anergates_ were marauding\r\nslaveowners, who attacked and made serfs of other ants. But gradually\r\nthey lost not only their arts but even their military prowess, and were\r\nreduced to making war by stealth instead of openly carrying off their\r\nslaves in fair battle. It seems probable that they now creep into a nest\r\nof the far more powerful slave ants, poison or assassinate the queen,\r\nand establish themselves by sheer usurpation in the queenless nest.\r\n'Gradually,' says Sir John Lubbock, 'even their bodily force dwindled\r\naway under the enervating influence to which they had subjected\r\nthemselves, until they sank to their present degraded condition--weak in\r\nbody and mind, few in numbers, and apparently nearly extinct, the\r\nmiserable representatives of far superior ancestors maintaining a\r\nprecarious existence as contemptible parasites of their former slaves.'\r\nOne may observe in passing that these wretched do-nothings cannot have\r\nbeen the ants which Solomon commended to the favourable consideration of\r\nthe sluggard; though it is curious that the text was never pressed into\r\nthe service of defence for the peculiar institution by the advocates of\r\nslavery in the South, who were always most anxious to prove the\r\nrighteousness of their cause by most sure and certain warranty of Holy\r\nScripture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIG ANIMALS\r\n\r\n\r\n'The Atlantosaurus,' said I, pointing affectionately with a wave of my\r\nleft hand to all that was immortal of that extinct reptile, 'is\r\nestimated to have had a total length of one hundred feet, and was\r\nprobably the very biggest lizard that ever lived, even in Western\r\nAmerica, where his earthly remains were first disinhumed by an\r\nenthusiastic explorer.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, yes,' my friend answered abstractedly. 'Of course, of course;\r\nthings were all so very big in those days, you know, my dear fellow.'\r\n\r\n'Excuse me,' I replied with polite incredulity; 'I really don't know to\r\nwhat particular period of time the phrase \"in those days\" may be\r\nsupposed precisely to refer.'\r\n\r\nMy friend shuffled inside his coat a little uneasily. (I will admit that\r\nI was taking a mean advantage of him. The professorial lecture in\r\nprivate life, especially when followed by a strict examination, is quite\r\nundeniably a most intolerable nuisance.) 'Well,' he said, in a crusty\r\nvoice, after a moment's hesitation, 'I mean, you know, in geological\r\ntimes ... well, there, my dear fellow, things used all to be so _very_\r\nbig in those days, usedn't they?'\r\n\r\nI took compassion upon him and let him off easily. 'You've had enough of\r\nthe museum,' I said with magnanimous self-denial. 'The Atlantosaurus has\r\nbroken the camel's back. Let's go and have a quiet cigarette in the park\r\noutside.'\r\n\r\nBut if you suppose, reader, that I am going to carry my forbearance so\r\nfar as to let you, too, off the remainder of that geological\r\ndisquisition, you are certainly very much mistaken. A discourse which\r\nwould be quite unpardonable in social intercourse may be freely admitted\r\nin the privacy of print; because, you see, while you can't easily tell a\r\nman that his conversation bores you (though some people just avoid doing\r\nso by an infinitesimal fraction), you can shut up a book whenever you\r\nlike, without the very faintest or remotest risk of hurting the author's\r\ndelicate susceptibilities.\r\n\r\nThe subject of my discourse naturally divides itself, like the\r\nconventional sermon, into two heads--the precise date of 'geological\r\ntimes,' and the exact bigness of the animals that lived in them. And I\r\nmay as well begin by announcing my general conclusion at the very\r\noutset; first, that 'those days' never existed at all; and, secondly,\r\nthat the animals which now inhabit this particular planet are, on the\r\nwhole, about as big, taken in the lump, as any previous contemporary\r\nfauna that ever lived at any one time together upon its changeful\r\nsurface. I know that to announce this sad conclusion is to break down\r\none more universal and cherished belief; everybody considers that\r\n'geological animals' were ever so much bigger than their modern\r\nrepresentatives; but the interests of truth should always be paramount,\r\nand, if the trade of an iconoclast is a somewhat cruel one, it is at\r\nleast a necessary function in a world so ludicrously overstocked with\r\npopular delusions as this erring planet.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is the ordinary idea of 'geological time' in the minds of\r\npeople like my good friend who refused to discuss with me the exact\r\nantiquity of the Atlantosaurian? They think of it all as immediate and\r\ncontemporaneous, a vast panorama of innumerable ages being all crammed\r\nfor them on to a single mental sheet, in which the dodo and the moa\r\nhob-an'-nob amicably with the pterodactyl and the ammonite; in which the\r\ntertiary megatherium goes cheek by jowl with the secondary deinosaurs\r\nand the primary trilobites; in which the huge herbivores of the Paris\r\nBasin are supposed to have browsed beneath the gigantic club-mosses of\r\nthe Carboniferous period, and to have been successfully hunted by the\r\ngreat marine lizards and flying dragons of the Jurassic Epoch. Such a\r\npicture is really just as absurd, or, to speak more correctly, a\r\nthousand times absurder, than if one were to speak of those grand old\r\ntimes when Homer and Virgil smoked their pipes together in the Mermaid\r\nTavern, while Shakespeare and Molière, crowned with summer roses, sipped\r\ntheir Falernian at their ease beneath the whispering palmwoods of the\r\nNevsky Prospect, and discussed the details of the play they were to\r\nproduce to-morrow in the crowded Colosseum, on the occasion of\r\nNapoleon's reception at Memphis by his victorious brother emperors,\r\nRamses and Sardanapalus. This is not, as the inexperienced reader may at\r\nfirst sight imagine, a literal transcript from one of the glowing\r\ndescriptions that crowd the beautiful pages of Ouida; it is a faint\r\nattempt to parallel in the brief moment of historical time the glaring\r\nanachronisms perpetually committed as regards the vast lapse of\r\ngeological chronology even by well-informed and intelligent people.\r\n\r\nWe must remember, then, that in dealing with geological time we are\r\ndealing with a positively awe-inspiring and unimaginable series of æons,\r\neach of which occupied its own enormous and incalculable epoch, and each\r\nof which saw the dawn, the rise, the culmination, and the downfall of\r\ninnumerable types of plant and animal. On the cosmic clock, by whose\r\npendulum alone we can faintly measure the dim ages behind us, the brief\r\nlapse of historical time, from the earliest of Egyptian dynasties to\r\nthe events narrated in this evening's _Pall Mall_, is less than a\r\nsecond, less than a unit, less than the smallest item by which we can\r\npossibly guide our blind calculations. To a geologist the temples of\r\nKarnak and the New Law Courts would be absolutely contemporaneous; he\r\nhas no means by which he could discriminate in date between a scarabæus\r\nof Thothmes, a denarius of Antonine, and a bronze farthing of her Most\r\nGracious Majesty Queen Victoria. Competent authorities have shown good\r\ngrounds for believing that the Glacial Epoch ended about 80,000 years\r\nago; and everything that has happened since the Glacial Epoch is, from\r\nthe geological point of view, described as 'recent.' A shell embedded in\r\na clay cliff sixty or seventy thousand years ago, while short and\r\nswarthy Mongoloids still dwelt undisturbed in Britain, ages before the\r\nirruption of the 'Ancient Britons' of our inadequate school-books, is,\r\nin the eyes of geologists generally, still regarded as purely modern.\r\n\r\nBut behind that indivisible moment of recent time, that eighty thousand\r\nyears which coincides in part with the fraction of a single swing of the\r\ncosmical pendulum, there lie hours, and days, and weeks, and months, and\r\nyears, and centuries, and ages of an infinite, an illimitable, an\r\ninconceivable past, whose vast divisions unfold themselves slowly, one\r\nbeyond the other, to our aching vision in the half-deciphered pages of\r\nthe geological record. Before the Glacial Epoch there comes the\r\nPliocene, immeasurably longer than the whole expanse of recent time; and\r\nbefore that again the still longer Miocene, and then the Eocene,\r\nimmeasurably longer than all the others put together. These three make\r\nup in their sum the Tertiary period, which entire period can hardly have\r\noccupied more time in its passage than a single division of the\r\nSecondary, such as the Cretaceous, or the Oolite, or the Triassic; and\r\nthe Secondary period, once more, though itself of positively appalling\r\nduration, seems but a patch (to use the expressive modernism) upon the\r\nunthinkable and unrealisable vastness of the endless successive Primary\r\næons. So that in the end we can only say, like Michael Scott's mystic\r\nhead, 'Time was, Time is, Time will be.' The time we know affords us no\r\nmeasure at all for even the nearest and briefest epochs of the time we\r\nknow not; and the time we know not seems to demand still vaster and more\r\ninexpressible figures as we pry back curiously, with wondering eyes,\r\ninto its dimmest and earliest recesses.\r\n\r\nThese efforts to realise the unrealisable make one's head swim; let us\r\nhark back once more from cosmical time to the puny bigness of our\r\nearthly animals, living or extinct.\r\n\r\nIf we look at the whole of our existing fauna, marine and terrestrial,\r\nwe shall soon see that we could bring together at the present moment a\r\nvery goodly collection of extant monsters, most parlous monsters, too,\r\neach about as fairly big in its own kind as almost anything that has\r\never preceded it. Every age has its own _specialité_ in the way of\r\nbigness; in one epoch it is the lizards that take suddenly to developing\r\novergrown creatures, the monarchs of creation in their little day; in\r\nanother, it is the fishes that blossom out unexpectedly into Titanic\r\nproportions; in a third, it is the sloths or the proboscideans that wax\r\nfat and kick with gigantic members; in a fourth, it may be the birds or\r\nthe men that are destined to evolve with future ages into veritable rocs\r\nor purely realistic Gargantuas or Brobdingnagians. The present period is\r\nmost undoubtedly the period of the cetaceans; and the future geologist\r\nwho goes hunting for dry bones among the ooze of the Atlantic, now known\r\nto us only by the scanty dredgings of our 'Alerts' and 'Challengers,'\r\nbut then upheaved into snow-clad Alps or vine-covered Apennines, will\r\ndoubtless stand aghast at the huge skeletons of our whales and our\r\nrazorbacks, and will mutter to himself in awe-struck astonishment, in\r\nthe exact words of my friend at South Kensington, 'Things used all to be\r\nso very big in those days, usedn't they?'\r\n\r\nNow, the fact as to the comparative size of our own cetaceans and of\r\n'geological' animals is just this. The Atlantosaurus of the Western\r\nAmerican Jurassic beds, a great erect lizard, is the very largest\r\ncreature ever known to have inhabited this sublunary sphere. His entire\r\nlength is supposed to have reached about a hundred feet (for no complete\r\nskeleton has ever been discovered), while in stature he appears to have\r\nstood some thirty feet high, or over. In any case, he was undoubtedly a\r\nvery big animal indeed, for his thigh-bone alone measures eight feet, or\r\ntwo feet taller than that glory of contemporary civilisation, a British\r\nGrenadier. This, of course, implies a very decent total of height and\r\nsize; but our own sperm whale frequently attains a good length of\r\nseventy feet, while the rorquals often run up to eighty, ninety, and\r\neven a hundred feet. We are thus fairly entitled to say that we have at\r\nleast one species of animal now living which, occasionally at any rate,\r\nequals in size the very biggest and most colossal form known\r\ninferentially to geological science. Indeed when we consider the\r\nextraordinary compactness and rotundity of the modern cetaceans, as\r\ncompared with the tall limbs and straggling skeleton of the huge\r\nJurassic deinosaurs, I am inclined to believe that the tonnage of a\r\ndecent modern rorqual must positively exceed that of the gigantic\r\nAtlantosaurus, the great lizard of the west, _in propria persona_. I\r\ndoubt, in short, whether even the solid thigh-bone of the deinosaur\r\ncould ever have supported the prodigious weight of a full-grown family\r\nrazor-back whale. The mental picture of these unwieldy monsters hopping\r\ncasually about, like Alice's Gryphon in Tenniel's famous sketch, or\r\nlike that still more parlous brute, the chortling Jabberwock, must be\r\nleft to the vivid imagination of the courteous reader, who may fill in\r\nthe details for himself as well as he is able.\r\n\r\nIf we turn from the particular comparison of selected specimens (always\r\nan unfair method of judging) to the general aspect of our contemporary\r\nfauna, I venture confidently to claim for our own existing human period\r\nas fine a collection of big animals as any other ever exhibited on this\r\nplanet by any one single rival epoch. Of course, if you are going to\r\nlump all the extinct monsters and horrors into one imaginary unified\r\nfauna, regardless of anachronisms, I have nothing more to say to you; I\r\nwill candidly admit that there were more great men in all previous\r\ngenerations put together, from Homer to Dickens, from Agamemnon to\r\nWellington, than there are now existing in this last quarter of our\r\nreally very respectable nineteenth century. But if you compare honestly\r\nage with age, one at a time, I fearlessly maintain that, so far from\r\nthere being any falling off in the average bigness of things generally\r\nin these latter days, there are more big things now living than there\r\never were in any one single epoch, even of much longer duration than the\r\n'recent' period.\r\n\r\nI suppose we may fairly say, from the evidence before us, that there\r\nhave been two Augustan Ages of big animals in the history of our\r\nearth--the Jurassic period, which was the zenith of the reptilian type,\r\nand the Pliocene, which was the zenith of the colossal terrestrial\r\ntertiary mammals. I say on purpose, 'from the evidence before us,'\r\nbecause, as I shall go on to explain hereafter, I do not myself believe\r\nthat any one age has much surpassed another in the general size of its\r\nfauna, since the Permian Epoch at least; and where we do not get\r\ngeological evidence of the existence of big animals in any particular\r\ndeposit, we may take it for granted, I think, that that deposit was laid\r\ndown under conditions unfavourable to the preservation of the remains of\r\nlarge species. For example, the sediment now being accumulated at the\r\nbottom of the Caspian cannot possibly contain the bones of any creature\r\nmuch larger than the Caspian seal, because there are no big species\r\nthere swimming; and yet that fact does not negative the existence in\r\nother places of whales, elephants, giraffes, buffaloes, and hippopotami.\r\nNevertheless, we can only go upon the facts before us; and if we compare\r\nour existing fauna with the fauna of Jurassic and Pliocene times, we\r\nshall at any rate be putting it to the test of the severest competition\r\nthat lies within our power under the actual circumstances.\r\n\r\nIn the Jurassic age there were undoubtedly a great many very big\r\nreptiles. 'A monstrous eft was of old the lord and master of earth: For\r\nhim did his high sun flame and his river billowing ran: And he felt\r\nhimself in his pride to be nature's crowning race.' There was the\r\nichthyosaurus, a fish-like marine lizard, familiar to us all from a\r\nthousand reconstructions, with his long thin body, his strong flippers,\r\nhis stumpy neck, and his huge pair of staring goggle eyes. The\r\nichthyosaurus was certainly a most unpleasant creature to meet alone in\r\na narrow strait on a dark night; but if it comes to actual measurement,\r\nthe very biggest ichthyosaurian skeleton ever unearthed does not exceed\r\ntwenty-five feet from snout to tail. Now, this is an extremely decent\r\nsize for a reptile, as reptiles go; for the crocodile and alligator, the\r\ntwo biggest existing lizards, seldom attain an extreme length of sixteen\r\nfeet. But there are other reptiles now living that easily beat the\r\nichthyosaurus, such, for example, as the larger pythons or rock-snakes,\r\nwhich not infrequently reach to thirty feet, and measure round the\r\nwaist as much as a London alderman of the noblest proportions. Of\r\ncourse, other Jurassic saurians easily beat this simple record. Our\r\nBritish Megalosaurus only extended twenty-five feet in length, and\r\ncarried weight not exceeding three tons; but, his rival Ceteosaurus\r\nstood ten feet high, and measured fifty feet from the tip of his snout\r\nto the end of his tail; while the dimensions of Titanosaurus may be\r\nbriefly described as sixty feet by thirty, and those of Atlantosaurus as\r\none hundred by thirty-two. Viewed as reptiles, we have certainly nothing\r\nat all to come up to these; but our cetaceans, as a group, show an\r\nassemblage of species which could very favourably compete with the whole\r\nlot of Jurassic saurians at any cattle show. Indeed, if it came to\r\ntonnage, I believe a good blubbery right-whale could easily give points\r\nto any deinosaur that ever moved upon oolitic continents.\r\n\r\nThe great mammals of the Pliocene age, again, such as the deinotherium\r\nand the mastodon, were also, in their way, very big things in livestock;\r\nbut they scarcely exceeded the modern elephant, and by no means came\r\nnear the modern whales. A few colossal ruminants of the same period\r\ncould have held their own well against our existing giraffes, elks, and\r\nbuffaloes; but, taking the group as a group, I don't think there is any\r\nreason to believe that it beat in general aspect the living fauna of\r\nthis present age.\r\n\r\nFor few people ever really remember how very many big animals we still\r\npossess. We have the Indian and the African elephant, the hippopotamus,\r\nthe various rhinoceroses, the walrus, the giraffe, the elk, the bison,\r\nthe musk ox, the dromedary, and the camel. Big marine animals are\r\ngenerally in all ages bigger than their biggest terrestrial rivals, and\r\nmost people lump all our big existing cetaceans under the common and\r\nridiculous title of whales, which makes this vast and varied assortment\r\nof gigantic species seem all reducible to a common form. As a matter of\r\nfact, however, there are several dozen colossal marine animals now\r\nsporting and spouting in all oceans, as distinct from one another as the\r\ncamel is from the ox, or the elephant from the hippopotamus. Our New\r\nZealand Berardius easily beats the ichthyosaurus; our sperm whale is\r\nmore than a match for any Jurassic European deinosaur; our rorqual, one\r\nhundred feet long, just equals the dimensions of the gigantic American\r\nAtlantosaurus himself. Besides these exceptional monsters, our\r\nbottleheads reach to forty feet, our California whales to forty-four,\r\nour hump-backs to fifty, and our razor-backs to sixty or seventy. True\r\nfish generally fall far short of these enormous dimensions, but some of\r\nthe larger sharks attain almost equal size with the biggest cetaceans.\r\nThe common blue shark, with his twenty-five feet of solid rapacity,\r\nwould have proved a tough antagonist, I venture to believe, for the best\r\nbred enaliosaurian that ever munched a lias ammonite. I would back our\r\nmodern carcharodon, who grows to forty feet, against any plesiosaurus\r\nthat ever swam the Jurassic sea. As for rhinodon, a gigantic shark of\r\nthe Indian Ocean, he has been actually measured to a length of fifty\r\nfeet, and is stated often to attain seventy. I will stake my reputation\r\nupon it that he would have cleared the secondary seas of their great\r\nsaurians in less than a century. When we come to add to these enormous\r\nmarine and terrestrial creatures such other examples as the great\r\nsnakes, the gigantic cuttle-fish, the grampuses, and manatees, and\r\nsea-lions, and sunfish, I am quite prepared fearlessly to challenge any\r\nother age that ever existed to enter the lists against our own for\r\ncolossal forms of animal life.\r\n\r\nAgain, it is a point worth noting that a great many of the very big\r\nanimals which people have in their minds when they talk vaguely about\r\neverything having been so very much bigger 'in those days' have become\r\nextinct within a very late period, and are often, from the geological\r\npoint of view, quite recent.\r\n\r\nFor example, there is our friend the mammoth. I suppose no animal is\r\nmore frequently present to the mind of the non-geological speaker, when\r\nhe talks indefinitely about the great extinct monsters, than the\r\nfamiliar figure of that huge-tusked, hairy northern elephant. Yet the\r\nmammoth, chronologically speaking, is but a thing of yesterday. He was\r\nhunted here in England by men whose descendants are probably still\r\nliving--at least so Professor Boyd Dawkins solemnly assures us; while in\r\nSiberia his frozen body, flesh and all, is found so very fresh that the\r\nwolves devour it, without raising any unnecessary question as to its\r\nfitness for lupine food. The Glacial Epoch is the yesterday of\r\ngeological time, and it was the Glacial Epoch that finally killed off\r\nthe last mammoth. Then, again, there is his neighbour, the mastodon.\r\nThat big tertiary proboscidean did not live quite long enough, it is\r\ntrue, to be hunted by the cavemen of the Pleistocene age, but he\r\nsurvived at any rate as long as the Pliocene--our day before\r\nyesterday--and he often fell very likely before the fire-split flint\r\nweapons of the Abbé Bourgeois' Miocene men. The period that separates\r\nhim from our own day is as nothing compared with the vast and\r\nimmeasurable interval that separates him from the huge marine saurians\r\nof the Jurassic world. To compare the relative lapses of time with human\r\nchronology, the mastodon stands to our own fauna as Beau Brummel stands\r\nto the modern masher, while the saurians stand to it as the Egyptian and\r\nAssyrian warriors stand to Lord Wolseley and the followers of the Mahdi.\r\n\r\nOnce more, take the gigantic moa of New Zealand, that enormous bird who\r\nwas to the ostrich as the giraffe is to the antelope; a monstrous emu,\r\nas far surpassing the ostriches of to-day as the ostriches surpass all\r\nthe other fowls of the air. Yet the moa, though now extinct, is in the\r\nstrictest sense quite modern, a contemporary very likely of Queen\r\nElizabeth or Queen Anne, exterminated by the Maoris only a very little\r\ntime before the first white settlements in the great southern\r\narchipelago. It is even doubtful whether the moa did not live down to\r\nthe days of the earliest colonists, for remains of Maori encampments are\r\nstill discovered, with the ashes of the fireplace even now unscattered,\r\nand the close-gnawed bones of the gigantic bird lying in the very spot\r\nwhere the natives left them after their destructive feasts. So, too,\r\nwith the big sharks. Our modern carcharodon, who runs (as I have before\r\nnoted) to forty feet in length, is a very respectable monster indeed, as\r\ntimes go; and his huge snapping teeth, which measure nearly two inches\r\nlong by one and a half broad, would disdain to make two bites of the\r\nable-bodied British seaman. But the naturalists of the 'Challenger'\r\nexpedition dredged up in numbers from the ooze of the Pacific similar\r\nteeth, five inches long by four wide, so that the sharks to which they\r\noriginally belonged must, by parity of reasoning, have measured nearly a\r\nhundred feet in length. This, no doubt, beats our biggest existing\r\nshark, the rhinodon, by some thirty feet. Still, the ooze of the Pacific\r\nis a quite recent or almost modern deposit, which is even now being\r\naccumulated on the sea bottom, and there would be really nothing\r\nastonishing in the discovery that some representatives of these colossal\r\ncarcharodons are to this day swimming about at their lordly leisure\r\namong the coral reefs of the South Sea Islands. That very cautious\r\nnaturalist, Dr. Günther, of the British Museum, contents himself indeed\r\nby merely saying: 'As we have no record of living individuals of that\r\nbulk having been observed, the gigantic species to which these teeth\r\nbelonged must probably have become extinct within a comparatively recent\r\nperiod.'\r\n\r\nIf these things are so, the question naturally suggests itself: Why\r\nshould certain types of animals have attained their greatest size at\r\ncertain different epochs, and been replaced at others by equally big\r\nanimals of wholly unlike sorts? The answer, I believe, is simply this:\r\nBecause there is not room and food in the world at any one time for more\r\nthan a certain relatively small number of gigantic species. Each great\r\ngroup of animals has had successively its rise, its zenith, its\r\ndecadence, and its dotage; each at the period of its highest development\r\nhas produced a considerable number of colossal forms; each has been\r\nsupplanted in due time by higher groups of totally different structure,\r\nwhich have killed off their predecessors, not indeed by actual stress of\r\nbattle, but by irresistible competition for food and prey. The great\r\nsaurians were thus succeeded by the great mammals, just as the great\r\nmammals are themselves in turn being ousted, from the land at least, by\r\nthe human species.\r\n\r\nLet us look briefly at the succession of big animals in the world, so\r\nfar as we can follow it from the mutilated and fragmentary record of the\r\ngeological remains.\r\n\r\nThe very earliest existing fossils would lead us to believe what is\r\notherwise quite probable, that life on our planet began with very small\r\nforms--that it passed at first through a baby stage. The animals of the\r\nCambrian period are almost all small mollusks, star-fishes, sponges, and\r\nother simple, primitive types of life. There were as yet no vertebrates\r\nof any sort, not even fishes, far less amphibians, reptiles, birds, or\r\nmammals. The veritable giants of the Cambrian world were the\r\ncrustaceans, and especially the trilobites, which, nevertheless, hardly\r\nexceeded in size a good big modern lobster. The biggest trilobite is\r\nsome two feet long; and though we cannot by any means say that this was\r\nreally the largest form of animal life then existing, owing to the\r\nextremely broken nature of the geological record, we have at least no\r\nevidence that anything bigger as yet moved upon the face of the waters.\r\nThe trilobites, which were a sort of triple-tailed crabs (to speak very\r\npopularly), began in the Cambrian Epoch, attained their culminating\r\npoint in the Silurian, waned in the Devonian, and died out utterly in\r\nthe Carboniferous seas.\r\n\r\nIt is in the second great epoch, the Silurian, that the cuttle-fish\r\ntribe, still fairly represented by the nautilus, the argonaut, the\r\nsquid, and the octopus, first began to make their appearance upon this\r\nor any other stage. The cuttle-fishes are among the most developed of\r\ninvertebrate animals; they are rapid swimmers; they have large and\r\npowerful eyes; and they can easily enfold their prey (_teste_ Victor\r\nHugo) in their long and slimy sucker-clad arms. With these natural\r\nadvantages to back them up, it is not surprising that the cuttle family\r\nrapidly made their mark in the world. They were by far the most advanced\r\nthinkers and actors of their own age, and they rose almost at once to be\r\nthe dominant creatures of the primæval ocean in which they swam. There\r\nwere as yet no saurians or whales to dispute the dominion with these\r\nrapacious cephalopods, and so the cuttle family had things for the time\r\nall their own way. Before the end of the Silurian Epoch, according to\r\nthat accurate census-taker, M. Barrande, they had blossomed forth into\r\nno less than 1,622 distinct species. For a single family to develop so\r\nenormous a variety of separate forms, all presumably derived from a\r\nsingle common ancestor, argues, of course, an immense success in life;\r\nand it also argues a vast lapse of time during which the different\r\nspecies were gradually demarcated from one another.\r\n\r\nSome of the ammonites, which belonged to this cuttle-fish group, soon\r\nattained a very considerable size; but a shell known as the orthoceras\r\n(I wish my subject didn't compel me to use such _very_ long words, but I\r\nam not personally answerable, thank heaven, for the vagaries of modern\r\nscientific nomenclature) grew to a bigger size than that of any other\r\nfossil mollusk, sometimes measuring as much as six feet in total length.\r\nAt what date the gigantic cuttles of the present day first began to make\r\ntheir appearance it would be hard to say, for their shell-less bodies\r\nare so soft that they could leave hardly anything behind in a fossil\r\nstate; but the largest known cuttle, measured by Mr. Gabriel, of\r\nNewfoundland, was eighty feet in length, including the long arms.\r\n\r\nThese cuttles are the only invertebrates at all in the running so far as\r\ncolossal size is concerned, and it will be observed that here the\r\nlargest modern specimen immeasurably beats the largest fossil form of\r\nthe same type. I do not say that there were not fossil forms quite as\r\nbig as the gigantic calamaries of our own time--on the contrary, I\r\nbelieve there were; but if we go by the record alone we must confess\r\nthat, in the matter of invertebrates at least, the balance of size is\r\nall in favour of our own period.\r\n\r\nThe vertebrates first make their appearance, in the shape of fishes,\r\ntowards the close of the Silurian period, the second of the great\r\ngeological epochs. The earliest fish appear to have been small,\r\nelongated, eel-like creatures, closely resembling the lampreys in\r\nstructure; but they rapidly developed in size and variety, and soon\r\nbecame the ruling race in the waters of the ocean, where they maintained\r\ntheir supremacy till the rise of the great secondary saurians. Even\r\nthen, in spite of the severe competition thus introduced, and still\r\nlater, in spite of the struggle for life against the huge modern\r\ncetaceans (the true monarchs of the recent seas), the sharks continued\r\nto hold their own as producers of gigantic forms; and at the present day\r\ntheir largest types probably rank second only to the whales in the whole\r\nrange of animated nature. There seems no reason to doubt that modern\r\nfish, as a whole, quite equal in size the piscine fauna of any previous\r\ngeological age.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat different with the next great vertebrate group, the\r\namphibians, represented in our own world only by the frogs, the toads,\r\nthe newts, and the axolotls. Here we must certainly with shame confess\r\nthat the amphibians of old greatly surpassed their degenerate\r\ndescendants in our modern waters. The Japanese salamander, by far the\r\nbiggest among our existing newts, never exceeds a yard in length from\r\nsnout to tail; whereas some of the labyrinthodonts (forgive me once\r\nmore) of the Carboniferous Epoch must have reached at least seven or\r\neight feet from stem to stern. But the reason of this falling off is not\r\nfar to seek. When the adventurous newts and frogs of that remote period\r\nfirst dropped their gills and hopped about inquiringly on the dry land,\r\nunder the shadow of the ancient tree-ferns and club-mosses, they were\r\nthe only terrestrial vertebrates then existing, and they had the field\r\n(or, rather, the forest) all to themselves. For a while, therefore, like\r\nall dominant races for the time being, they blossomed forth at their\r\nease into relatively gigantic forms. Frogs as big as donkeys, and efts\r\nas long as crocodiles, luxuriated to their hearts' content in the marshy\r\nlowlands, and lorded it freely over the small creatures which they found\r\nin undisturbed possession of the Carboniferous isles. But as ages passed\r\naway, and new improvements were slowly invented and patented by survival\r\nof the fittest in the offices of nature, their own more advanced and\r\ndeveloped descendants, the reptiles and mammals, got the upper hand\r\nwith them, and soon lived them down in the struggle for life, so that\r\nthis essentially intermediate form is now almost entirely restricted to\r\nits one adapted seat, the pools and ditches that dry up in summer.\r\n\r\nThe reptiles, again, are a class in which the biggest modern forms are\r\nsimply nowhere beside the gigantic extinct species. First appearing on\r\nthe earth at the very close of the vast primary periods--in the Permian\r\nage--they attained in secondary times the most colossal proportions, and\r\nhave certainly never since been exceeded in size by any later forms of\r\nlife in whatever direction. But one must remember that during the heyday\r\nof the great saurians, there were as yet no birds and no mammals. The\r\nplace now filled in the ocean by the whales and grampuses, as well as\r\nthe place now filled in the great continents by the elephants, the\r\nrhinoceroses, the hippopotami, and the other big quadrupeds, was then\r\nfilled exclusively by huge reptiles, of the sort rendered familiar to us\r\nall by the restored effigies on the little island in the Crystal Palace\r\ngrounds. Every dog has his day, and the reptiles had _their_ day in the\r\nsecondary period. The forms into which they developed were certainly\r\nevery whit as large as any ever seen on the surface of this planet, but\r\nnot, as I have already shown, appreciably larger than those of the\r\nbiggest cetaceans known to science in our own time.\r\n\r\nDuring the very period, however, when enaliosaurians and pterodactyls\r\nwere playing such pranks before high heaven as might have made\r\ncontemporary angels weep, if they took any notice of saurian morality, a\r\nsmall race of unobserved little prowlers was growing up in the dense\r\nshades of the neighbouring forests which was destined at last to oust\r\nthe huge reptiles from their empire over earth, and to become in the\r\nfulness of time the exclusively dominant type of the whole planet. In\r\nthe trias we get the first remains of mammalian life in the shape of\r\ntiny rat-like animals, marsupial in type, and closely related to the\r\nbanded ant-eaters of New South Wales at the present day. Throughout the\r\nlong lapse of the secondary ages, across the lias, the oolite, the\r\nwealden, and the chalk, we find the mammalian race slowly developing\r\ninto opossums and kangaroos, such as still inhabit the isolated and\r\nantiquated continent of Australia. Gathering strength all the time for\r\nthe coming contest, increasing constantly in size of brain and keenness\r\nof intelligence, the true mammals were able at last, towards the close\r\nof the secondary ages, to enter the lists boldly against the gigantic\r\nsaurians. With the dawn of the tertiary period, the reign of the\r\nreptiles begins to wane, and the reign of the mammals to set in at last\r\nin real earnest. In place of the ichthyosaurs we get the huge cetaceans;\r\nin place of the deinosaurs we get the mammoth and the mastodon; in place\r\nof the dominant reptile groups we get the first precursors of man\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nThe history of the great birds has been somewhat more singular. Unlike\r\nthe other main vertebrate classes, the birds (as if on purpose to\r\ncontradict the proverb) seem never yet to have had their day.\r\nUnfortunately for them, or at least for their chance of producing\r\ncolossal species, their evolution went on side by side, apparently, with\r\nthat of the still more intelligent and more powerful mammals; so that,\r\nwherever the mammalian type had once firmly established itself, the\r\nbirds were compelled to limit their aspirations to a very modest and\r\nhumble standard. Terrestrial mammals, however, cannot cross the sea; so\r\nin isolated regions, such as New Zealand and Madagascar, the birds had\r\nthings all their own way. In New Zealand, there are no indigenous\r\nquadrupeds at all; and there the huge moa attained to dimensions almost\r\nequalling those of the giraffe. In Madagascar, the mammalian life was\r\nsmall and of low grade, so the gigantic æpyornis became the very biggest\r\nof all known birds. At the same time, these big species acquired their\r\nimmense size at the cost of the distinctive birdlike habit of flight. A\r\nflying moa is almost an impossible conception; even the ostriches\r\ncompete practically with the zebras and antelopes rather than with the\r\neagles, the condors, or the albatrosses. In like manner, when a pigeon\r\nfound its way to Mauritius, it developed into the practically wingless\r\ndodo; while in the northern penguins, on their icy perches, the fore\r\nlimbs have been gradually modified into swimming organs, exactly\r\nanalogous to the flippers of the seal.\r\n\r\nAre the great animals now passing away and leaving no representatives of\r\ntheir greatness to future ages? On land at least that is very probable.\r\nMan, diminutive man, who, if he walked on all fours, would be no bigger\r\nthan a silly sheep, and who only partially disguises his native\r\nsmallness by his acquired habit of walking erect on what ought to be his\r\nhind legs--man has upset the whole balanced economy of nature, and is\r\neverywhere expelling and exterminating before him the great herbivores,\r\nhis predecessors. He needs for his corn and his bananas the fruitful\r\nplains which were once laid down in prairie or scrubwood. Hence it seems\r\nnot unlikely that the elephant, the hippopotamus, the rhinoceros, and\r\nthe buffalo must go. But we are still a long way off from that final\r\nconsummation, even on dry land; while as for the water, it appears\r\nhighly probable that there are as good fish still in the sea as ever\r\ncame out of it. Whether man himself, now become the sole dominant animal\r\nof our poor old planet, will ever develop into Titanic proportions,\r\nseems far more problematical. The race is now no longer to the swift,\r\nnor the battle to the strong. Brain counts for more than muscle, and\r\nmind has gained the final victory over mere matter. Goliath of Gath has\r\nshrunk into insignificance before the Gatling gun; as in the fairy tales\r\nof old, it is cunning little Jack with his clever devices who wins the\r\nday against the heavy, clumsy, muddle-headed giants. Nowadays it is our\r\n'Minotaurs' and 'Warriors' that are the real leviathans and behemoths of\r\nthe great deep; our Krupps and Armstrongs are the fire-breathing krakens\r\nof the latter-day seas. Instead of developing individually into huge\r\nproportions, the human race tends rather to aggregate into vast empires,\r\nwhich compete with one another by means of huge armaments, and invent\r\nmitrailleuses and torpedos of incredible ferocity for their mutual\r\ndestruction. The dragons of the prime that tare each other in their\r\nslime have yielded place to eighty-ton guns and armour-plated\r\nturret-ships. Those are the genuine lineal representatives on our modern\r\nseas of the secondary saurians. Let us hope that some coming geologist\r\nof the dim future, finding the fossil remains of the sunken 'Captain,'\r\nor the plated scales of the 'Comte de Grasse,' firmly embedded in the\r\nupheaved ooze of the existing Atlantic, may shake his head in solemn\r\ndeprecation at the horrid sight, and thank heaven that such hideous\r\ncarnivorous creatures no longer exist in his own day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOSSIL FOOD\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is something at first sight rather ridiculous in the idea of\r\neating a fossil. To be sure, when the frozen mammoths of Siberia were\r\nfirst discovered, though they had been dead for at least 80,000 years\r\n(according to Dr. Croll's minimum reckoning for the end of the great ice\r\nage), and might therefore naturally have begun to get a little musty,\r\nthey had nevertheless been kept so fresh, like a sort of prehistoric\r\nAustralian mutton, in their vast natural refrigerators, that the wolves\r\nand bears greedily devoured the precious relics for which the\r\nnaturalists of Europe would have been ready gladly to pay the highest\r\nmarket price of best beefsteak. Those carnivorous vandals gnawed off the\r\nskin and flesh with the utmost appreciation, and left nothing but the\r\ntusks and bones to adorn the galleries of the new Natural History Museum\r\nat South Kensington. But then wolves and bears, especially in Siberia,\r\nare not exactly fastidious about the nature of their meat diet.\r\nFurthermore, some of the bones of extinct animals found beneath the\r\nstalagmitic floor of caves, in England and elsewhere, presumably of\r\nabout the same age as the Siberian mammoths, still contain enough animal\r\nmatter to produce a good strong stock for antediluvian broth, which has\r\nbeen scientifically described by a high authority as pre-Adamite jelly.\r\nThe congress of naturalists at Tübingen a few years since had a smoking\r\ntureen of this cave-bone soup placed upon the dinner-table at their\r\nhotel one evening, and pronounced it with geological enthusiasm\r\n'scarcely inferior to prime ox-tail.' But men of science, too, are\r\naccustomed to trying unsavoury experiments, which would go sadly against\r\nthe grain with less philosophic and more squeamish palates. They think\r\nnothing of tasting a caterpillar that birds will not touch, in order to\r\ndiscover whether it owes its immunity from attack to some nauseous,\r\nbitter, or pungent flavouring; and they even advise you calmly to\r\ndiscriminate between two closely similar species of snails by trying\r\nwhich of them when chewed has a delicate _soupçon_ of oniony aroma. So\r\nthat naturalists in this matter, as the children say, don't count: their\r\nuniversal thirst for knowledge will prompt them to drink anything, down\r\neven to _consommé_ of quaternary cave-bear.\r\n\r\nThere is one form of fossil food, however, which appears constantly upon\r\nall our tables at breakfast, lunch, and dinner, every day, and which is\r\nso perfectly familiar to every one of us that we almost forget entirely\r\nits immensely remote geological origin. The salt in our salt-cellars is\r\na fossil product, laid down ages ago in some primæval Dead Sea or\r\nCaspian, and derived in all probability (through the medium of the\r\ngrocer) from the triassic rocks of Cheshire or Worcestershire. Since\r\nthat thick bed of rock-salt was first precipitated upon the dry floor of\r\nsome old evaporated inland sea, the greater part of the geological\r\nhistory known to the world at large has slowly unrolled itself through\r\nincalculable ages. The dragons of the prime have begun and finished\r\ntheir long (and Lord Tennyson says slimy) race. The fish-like saurians\r\nand flying pterodactyls of the secondary period have come into existence\r\nand gone out of it gracefully again. The whole family of birds has been\r\ndeveloped and diversified into its modern variety of eagles and titmice.\r\nThe beasts of the field have passed through sundry stages of mammoth\r\nand mastodon, of sabre-toothed lion and huge rhinoceros. Man himself has\r\nprogressed gradually from the humble condition of a 'hairy arboreal\r\nquadruped'--these bad words are Mr. Darwin's own--to the glorious\r\nelevation of an erect, two-handed creature, with a county suffrage\r\nquestion and an intelligent interest in the latest proceedings of the\r\ncentral divorce court. And after all those manifold changes, compared to\r\nwhich the entire period of English history, from the landing of Julius\r\nCæsar to the appearance of this present volume (to take two important\r\nlandmarks), is as one hour to a human lifetime, we quietly dig up the\r\nsalt to-day from that dry lake bottom and proceed to eat it with the\r\neggs laid by the hens this morning for this morning's breakfast, just as\r\nthough the one food-stuff were not a whit more ancient or more dignified\r\nin nature than the other. Why, mammoth steak is really quite modern and\r\ncommonplace by the side of the salt in the salt-cellar that we treat so\r\ncavalierly every day of our ephemeral existence.\r\n\r\nThe way salt got originally deposited in these great rock beds is very\r\nwell illustrated for us by the way it is still being deposited in the\r\nevaporating waters of many inland seas. Every schoolboy knows of course\r\n(though some persons who are no longer schoolboys may just possibly have\r\nforgotten) that the Caspian is in reality only a little bit of the\r\nMediterranean, which has been cut off from the main sea by the gradual\r\nelevation of the country between them. For many ages the intermediate\r\nsoil has been quite literally rising in the world; but to this day a\r\ncontinuous chain of salt lakes and marshes runs between the Caspian and\r\nthe Black Sea, and does its best to keep alive the memory of the time\r\nwhen they were both united in a single basin. All along this intervening\r\ntract, once sea but now dry land, banks of shells belonging to kinds\r\nstill living in the Caspian and the Black Sea alike testify to the old\r\nline of water communication. One fine morning (date unknown) the\r\nintermediate belt began to rise up between them; the water was all\r\npushed off into the Caspian, but the shells remained to tell the tale\r\neven unto this day.\r\n\r\nNow, when a bit of the sea gets cut off in this way from the main ocean,\r\nevaporation of its waters generally takes place rather faster than the\r\nreturn supply of rain by rivers and lesser tributaries. In other words,\r\nthe inland sea or salt lake begins slowly to dry up. This is now just\r\nhappening in the Caspian, which is in fact a big pool in course of being\r\nslowly evaporated. By-and-by a point is reached when the water can no\r\nlonger hold in solution the amount of salts of various sorts that it\r\noriginally contained. In the technical language of chemists and\r\nphysicists it begins to get supersaturated. Then the salts are thrown\r\ndown as a sediment at the bottom of the sea or lake, exactly as crust\r\nformed on the bottom of a kettle. Gypsum is the first material to be so\r\nthrown down, because it is less soluble than common salt, and therefore\r\nsooner got rid of. It forms a thick bottom layer in the bed of all\r\nevaporating inland seas; and as plaster of Paris it not only gives rise\r\nfinally to artistic monstrosities hawked about the streets for the\r\ndegradation of national taste, but also plays an important part in the\r\nmanufacture of bonbons, the destruction of the human digestion, and the\r\nultimate ruin of the dominant white European race. Only about a third of\r\nthe water in a salt lake need be evaporated before the gypsum begins to\r\nbe deposited in a solid layer over its whole bed; it is not till 93 per\r\ncent. of the water has gone, and only 7 per cent. is left, that common\r\nsalt begins to be thrown down. When that point of intensity is reached,\r\nthe salt, too, falls as a sediment to the bottom, and there overlies the\r\ngypsum deposit. Hence all the world over, wherever we come upon a bed\r\nof rock salt, it almost invariably lies upon a floor of solid gypsum.\r\n\r\nThe Caspian, being still a very respectable modern sea, constantly\r\nsupplied with fresh water from the surrounding rivers, has not yet begun\r\nby any means to deposit salt on its bottom from its whole mass; but the\r\nshallow pools and long bays around its edge have crusts of beautiful\r\nrose-coloured salt-crystals forming upon their sides; and as these\r\nlesser basins gradually dry up, the sand, blown before the wind, slowly\r\ndrifts over them, so as to form miniature rock-salt beds on a very small\r\nscale. Nevertheless, the young and vigorous Caspian only represents the\r\nfirst stage in the process of evaporation of an inland sea. It is still\r\nfresh enough to form the abode of fish and mollusks; and the\r\nirrepressible young lady of the present generation is perhaps even aware\r\nthat it contains numbers of seals, being in fact the seat of one of the\r\nmost important and valuable seal-fisheries in the whole world. It may be\r\nregarded as a typical example of a yet youthful and lively inland sea.\r\n\r\nThe Dead Sea, on the other hand, is an old and decrepit salt lake in a\r\nvery advanced state of evaporation. It lies several feet below the level\r\nof the Mediterranean, just as the Caspian lies several feet below the\r\nlevel of the Black Sea; and as in both cases the surface must once have\r\nbeen continuous, it is clear that the water of either sheet must have\r\ndried up to a very considerable extent. But, while the Caspian has\r\nshrunk only to 85 feet below the Black Sea, the Dead Sea has shrunk to\r\nthe enormous depth of 1,292 feet below the Mediterranean. Every now and\r\nthen, some enterprising De Lesseps or other proposes to dig a canal from\r\nthe Mediterranean to the Dead Sea, and so re-establish the old high\r\nlevel. The effect of this very revolutionary proceeding would be to\r\nflood the entire Jordan Valley, connect the Sea of Galilee with the Dead\r\nSea, and play the dickens generally with Scripture geography, to the\r\ninfinite delight of Sunday school classes. Now, when the Dead Sea first\r\nbegan its independent career as a separate sheet of water on its own\r\naccount, it no doubt occupied the whole bed of this imaginary engineers'\r\nlake--spreading, if not from Dan to Beersheba, at any rate from Dan to\r\nEdom, or, in other words, along the whole Jordan Valley from the Sea of\r\nGalilee and even the Waters of Merom to the southern desert. (I will not\r\ninsult the reader's intelligence and orthodoxy by suggesting that\r\nperhaps he may not be precisely certain as to the exact position of the\r\nWaters of Merom; but I will merely recommend him just to refresh his\r\nmemory by turning to his atlas, as this is an opportunity which may not\r\nagain occur.) The modern Dead Sea is the last shrunken relic of such a\r\nconsiderable ancient lake. Its waters are now so very concentrated and\r\nso very nasty that no fish or other self-respecting animal can consent\r\nto live in them; and so buoyant that a man can't drown himself, even if\r\nhe tries, because the sea is saturated with salts of various sorts till\r\nit has become a kind of soup or porridge, in which a swimmer floats,\r\nwill he nill he. Persons in the neighbourhood who wish to commit suicide\r\nare therefore obliged to go elsewhere: much as in Tasmania, the\r\nhealthiest climate in the world, people who want to die are obliged to\r\nrun across for a week to Sydney or Melbourne.\r\n\r\nThe waters of the Dead Sea are thus in the condition of having already\r\ndeposited almost all their gypsum, as well as the greater part of the\r\nsalt they originally contained. They are, in fact, much like sea water\r\nwhich has been boiled down till it has reached the state of a thick\r\nsalty liquid; and though most of the salt is now already deposited in a\r\ndeep layer on the bottom, enough still remains in solution to make the\r\nDead Sea infinitely salter than the general ocean. At the same time,\r\nthere are a good many other things in solution in sea water besides\r\ngypsum and common salt; such as chloride of magnesia sulphate of\r\npotassium, and other interesting substances with pretty chemical names,\r\nwell calculated to endear them at first sight to the sentimental\r\naffections of the general public. These other by-contents of the water\r\nare often still longer in getting deposited than common salt; and, owing\r\nto their intermixture in a very concentrated form with the mother liquid\r\nof the Dead Sea, the water of that evaporating lake is not only salt but\r\nalso slimy and fetid to the last degree, its taste being accurately\r\ndescribed as half brine, half rancid oil. Indeed, the salt has been so\r\nfar precipitated already that there is now five times as much chloride\r\nof magnesium left in the water as there is common salt. By the way, it\r\nis a lucky thing for us that these various soluble minerals are of such\r\nconstitution as to be thrown down separately at different stages of\r\nconcentration in the evaporating liquid; for, if it were otherwise, they\r\nwould all get deposited together, and we should find on all old salt\r\nlake beds only a mixed layer of gypsum, salt, and other chlorides and\r\nsulphates, absolutely useless for any practical human purpose. In that\r\ncase, we should be entirely dependent upon marine salt pans and\r\nartificial processes for our entire salt supply. As it is, we find the\r\nmaterials deposited one above another in regular layers; first, the\r\ngypsum at the bottom; then the rock-salt; and last of all, on top, the\r\nmore soluble mineral constituents.\r\n\r\nThe Great Salt Lake of Utah, sacred to the memory of Brigham Young,\r\ngives us an example of a modern saline sheet of very different origin,\r\nsince it is in fact not a branch of the sea at all, but a mere shrunken\r\nremnant of a very large fresh-water lake system, like that of the\r\nstill-existing St. Lawrence chain. Once upon a time, American geologists\r\nsay, a huge sheet of water, for which they have even invented a\r\ndefinite name, Lake Bonneville, occupied a far larger valley among the\r\noutliers of the Rocky Mountains, measuring 300 miles in one direction by\r\n180 miles in the other. Beside this primitive Superior lay a second\r\ngreat sheet--an early Huron--(Lake Lahontan, the geologists call it)\r\nalmost as big, and equally of fresh water. By-and-by--the precise dates\r\nare necessarily indefinite--some change in the rainfall, unregistered by\r\nany contemporary 'New York Herald,' made the waters of these big lakes\r\nshrink and evaporate. Lake Lahontan shrank away like Alice in\r\nWonderland, till there was absolutely nothing left of it; Lake\r\nBonneville shrank till it attained the diminished size of the existing\r\nGreat Salt Lake. Terrace after terrace, running in long parallel lines\r\non the sides of the Wahsatch Mountains around, mark the various levels\r\nat which it rested for awhile on its gradual downward course. It is\r\nstill falling indeed; and the plain around is being gradually uncovered,\r\nforming the white salt-encrusted shore with which all visitors to the\r\nMormon city are so familiar.\r\n\r\nBut why should the water have become briny? Why should the evaporation\r\nof an old Superior produce at last a Great Salt Lake? Well, there is a\r\nsmall quantity of salt in solution even in the freshest of lakes and\r\nponds, brought down to them by the streams or rivers; and, as the water\r\nof the hypothetical Lake Bonneville slowly evaporated, the salt and\r\nother mineral constituents remained behind. Thus the solution grew\r\nconstantly more and more concentrated, till at the present day it is\r\nextremely saline. Professor Geikie (to whose works the present paper is\r\nmuch indebted) found that he floated on the water in spite of himself;\r\nand the under sides of the steps at the bathing-places are all encrusted\r\nwith short stalactites of salt, produced from the drip of the bathers as\r\nthey leave the water. The mineral constituents, however, differ\r\nconsiderably in their proportions from those found in true salt lakes of\r\nmarine origin; and the point at which the salt is thrown down is still\r\nfar from having been reached. Great Salt Lake must simmer in the sun for\r\nmany centuries yet before the point arrives at which (as cooks say) it\r\nbegins to settle.\r\n\r\nThat is the way in which deposits of salt are being now produced on the\r\nworld's surface, in preparation for that man of the future who, as we\r\nlearn from a duly constituted authority, is to be hairless, toothless,\r\nweb-footed, and far too respectable ever to be funny. Man of the present\r\nderives his existing salt-supply chiefly from beds of rock-salt\r\nsimilarly laid down against his expected appearance some hundred\r\nthousand æons or so ago. (An æon is a very convenient geological unit\r\nindeed to reckon by; as nobody has any idea how long it is, they can't\r\ncarp at you for a matter of an æon or two one way or the other.)\r\nRock-salt is found in most parts of the world, in beds of very various\r\nages. The great Salt Range of the Punjaub is probably the earliest in\r\ndate of all salt deposits; it was laid down at the bottom of some very\r\nancient Asiatic Mediterranean, whose last shrunken remnant covered the\r\nupper basin of the Indus and its tributaries during the Silurian age.\r\nEurope had then hardly begun to be; and England was probably still\r\ncovered from end to end by the primæval ocean. From this very primitive\r\nsalt deposit the greater part of India and Central Asia is still\r\nsupplied; and the Indian Government makes a pretty penny out of the dues\r\nin the shape of the justly detested salt-tax--a tax especially odious\r\nbecause it wrings the fraction of a farthing even from those unhappy\r\nagricultural labourers who have never tasted ghee with their rice.\r\n\r\nThe thickness of the beds in each salt deposit of course depends\r\nentirely upon the area of the original sea or salt-lake, and the length\r\nof time during which the evaporation went on. Sometimes we may get a\r\nmere film of salt; sometimes a solid bed six hundred feet thick.\r\nPerfectly pure rock-salt is colourless and transparent; but one doesn't\r\noften find it pure. Alas for a degenerate world! even in its original\r\nsite, Nature herself has taken the trouble to adulterate it beforehand.\r\n(If she hadn't done so, one may be perfectly sure that commercial\r\nenterprise would have proved equal to the occasion in the long run.) But\r\nthe adulteration hasn't spoilt the beauty of the salt; on the contrary,\r\nit serves, like rouge, to give a fine fresh colour where none existed.\r\nWhen iron is the chief colouring matter, rock-salt assumes a beautiful\r\nclear red tint; in other cases it is emerald green or pale blue. As a\r\nrule, salt is prepared from it for table by a regular process; but it\r\nhas become a fad of late with a few people to put crystals of native\r\nrock-salt on their tables; and they decidedly look very pretty, and have\r\na certain distinctive flavour of their own that is not unpleasant.\r\n\r\nOur English salt supply is chiefly derived from the Cheshire and\r\nWorcestershire salt-regions, which are of triassic age. Many of the\r\nplaces at which the salt is mined have names ending in _wich_, such as\r\nNorthwich, Middlewich, Nantwich, Droitwich, Netherwich, and Shirleywich.\r\nThis termination _wich_ is itself curiously significant, as Canon Isaac\r\nTaylor has shown, of the necessary connection between salt and the sea.\r\nThe earliest known way of producing salt was of course in shallow pans\r\non the sea-shore, at the bottom of a shoal bay, called in Norse and\r\nEarly English a wick or wich; and the material so produced is still\r\nknown in trade as bay-salt. By-and-by, when people came to discover the\r\ninland brine-pits and salt mines, they transferred to them the familiar\r\nname, a wich; and the places where the salt was manufactured came to be\r\nknown as wych-houses. Droitwich, for example, was originally such a\r\nwich, where the droits or dues on salt were paid at the time when\r\nWilliam the Conqueror's commissioners drew up their great survey for\r\nDomesday Book. But the good, easy-going mediæval people who gave these\r\nquaint names to the inland wiches had probably no idea that they were\r\nreally and truly dried-up bays, and that the salt they mined from their\r\npits was genuine ancient bay-salt, the deposit of an old inland sea,\r\nevaporated by slow degrees a countless number of ages since, exactly as\r\nthe Dead Sea and the Great Salt Lake are getting evaporated in our own\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nSuch, nevertheless, is actually the case. A good-sized Caspian used to\r\nspread across the centre of England and north of Ireland in triassic\r\ntimes, bounded here and there, as well as Dr. Hull can make out, by the\r\nWelsh Mountains, the Cheviots, and the Donegal Hills, and with the Peak\r\nof Derbyshire and the Isle of Man standing out as separate islands from\r\nits blue expanse. (We will beg the question that the English seas were\r\nthen blue. They are certainly marked so in a very fine cerulean tint on\r\nDr. Hull's map of Triassic Britain.) Slowly, like most other inland\r\nseas, this early British Caspian began to lose weight and to shrivel\r\naway to ever smaller dimensions. In Devonshire, where it appears to have\r\nfirst dried up, we get no salt, but only red marl, with here and there a\r\ncubical cast, filling a hole once occupied by rock-salt, though the\r\npercolation of the rain has long since melted out that very soluble\r\nsubstance, and replaced it by a mere mould in the characteristic square\r\nshape of salt crystals. But Worcestershire and Cheshire were the seat of\r\nthe inland sea when it had contracted to the dimensions of a mere salt\r\nlake, and begun to throw down its dissolved saline materials. One of the\r\nCheshire beds is sometimes a hundred feet thick of almost pure and\r\ncrystalline rock-salt. The absence of fossils shows that animals must\r\nhave had as bad a time of it there as in the Dead Sea of our modern\r\nPalestine. The Droitwich brine-pits have been known for many centuries,\r\nsince they were worked (and taxed) even before the Norman Conquest, as\r\nwere many other similar wells elsewhere. But the actual mining of\r\nrock-salt as such in England dates back only as far as the reign of King\r\nCharles II. of blessed memory, or more definitely to the very year in\r\nwhich the 'Pilgrim's Progress' was conceived and written by John Bunyan.\r\nDuring that particular summer, an enterprising person at Nantwich had\r\nsunk a shaft for coal, which he failed to find; but on his way down he\r\ncame unexpectedly across the bed of rock-salt, then for the first time\r\ndiscovered as a native mineral. Since that fortunate accident the beds\r\nhave been so energetically worked and the springs so energetically\r\npumped that some of the towns built on top of them have got undermined,\r\nand now threaten from year to year, in the most literal sense, to cave\r\nin. In fact, one or two subsidences of considerable extent have already\r\ntaken place, due in part no doubt to the dissolving action of rain\r\nwater, but in part also to the mode of working. The mines are approached\r\nby a shaft; and, when you get down to the level of the old sea bottom,\r\nyou find yourself in a sort of artificial gallery, whose roof, with all\r\nthe world on top of it, is supported every here and there by massive\r\npillars about fifteen feet thick. Considering that the salt lies often a\r\nhundred and fifty yards deep, and that these pillars have to bear the\r\nweight of all that depth of solid rock, it is not surprising that\r\nsubsidences should sometimes occur in abandoned shafts, where the water\r\nis allowed to collect, and slowly dissolve away the supporting columns.\r\n\r\nSalt is a necessary article of food for animals, but in a far less\r\ndegree than is commonly supposed. Each of us eats on an average about\r\nten times as much salt as we actually require. In this respect popular\r\nnotions are as inexact as in the very similar case of the supply of\r\nphosphorus. Because phosphorus is needful for brain action, people jump\r\nforthwith to the absurd conclusion that fish and other foods rich in\r\nphosphates ought to be specially good for students preparing for\r\nexamination, great thinkers, and literary men. Mark Twain indeed once\r\nadvised a poetical aspirant, who sent him a few verses for his critical\r\nopinion, that fish was very feeding for the brains; he would recommend a\r\ncouple of young whales to begin upon. As a matter of fact, there is more\r\nphosphorus in our daily bread than would have sufficed Shakespeare to\r\nwrite 'Hamlet,' or Newton to discover the law of gravitation. It isn't\r\nphosphorus that most of us need, but brains to burn it in. A man might\r\nas well light a fire in a carriage, because coal makes an engine go, as\r\nhope to mend the pace of his dull pate by eating fish for the sake of\r\nthe phosphates.\r\n\r\nThe question still remains, How did the salt originally get there? After\r\nall, when we say that it was produced, as rock-salt, by evaporation of\r\nthe water in inland seas, we leave unanswered the main problem, How did\r\nthe brine in solution get into the sea at all in the first place? Well,\r\none might almost as well ask, How did anything come to be upon the earth\r\nat any time, in any way? How did the sea itself get there? How did this\r\nplanet swim into existence at all? In the Indian mythology the world is\r\nsupported upon the back of an elephant, who is supported upon the back\r\nof a tortoise; but what the tortoise in the last resort is supported\r\nupon the Indian philosophers prudently say not. If we once begin thus\r\npushing back our inquiries into the genesis of the cosmos, we shall find\r\nour search retreating step after step _ad infinitum_. The negro\r\npreacher, describing the creation of Adam, and drawing slightly upon\r\nhis imagination, observed that when our prime forefather first came to\r\nconsciousness he found himself 'sot up agin a fence.' One of his hearers\r\nventured sceptically to ejaculate, 'Den whar dat fence come from,\r\nministah?' The outraged divine scratched his grey wool reflectively for\r\na moment, and replied, after a pause, with stern solemnity, 'Tree more\r\nob dem questions will undermine de whole system ob teology.'\r\n\r\nHowever, we are not permitted humbly to imitate the prudent reticence of\r\nthe Indian philosophers. In these days of evolution hypotheses, and\r\nnebular theories, and kinetic energy, and all the rest of it, the\r\nquestion why the sea is salt rises up irrepressible and imperatively\r\ndemands to get itself answered. There was a sapient inquirer, recently\r\ndeceased, who had a short way out of this difficulty. He held that the\r\nsea was only salt because of all the salt rivers that run into it.\r\nConsidering that the salt rivers are themselves salted by passing\r\nthrough salt regions, or being fed by saline springs, all of which\r\nderive their saltness from deposits laid down long ago by evaporation\r\nfrom earlier seas or lake basins, this explanation savours somewhat of\r\ncircularity. It amounts in effect to saying that the sea is salt because\r\nof the large amount of saline matter which it holds in solution. Cheese\r\nis also a caseous preparation of milk; the duties of an archdeacon are\r\nto perform archidiaconal functions; and opium puts one to sleep because\r\nit possesses a soporific virtue.\r\n\r\nApart from such purely verbal explanations of the saltness of the sea,\r\nhowever, one can only give some such account of the way it came to be\r\n'the briny' as the following:--\r\n\r\nThis world was once a haze of fluid light, as the poets and the men of\r\nscience agree in informing us. As soon as it began to cool down a\r\nlittle, the heavier materials naturally sank towards the centre, while\r\nthe lighter, now represented by the ocean and the atmosphere, floated in\r\na gaseous condition on the outside. But the great envelope of vapour\r\nthus produced did not consist merely of the constituents of air and\r\nwater; many other gases and vapours mingled with them, as they still do\r\nto a far less extent in our existing atmosphere. By-and-by, as the\r\ncooling and condensing process continued, the water settled down from\r\nthe condition of steam into one of a liquid at a dull red heat. As it\r\ncondensed, it carried down with it a great many other substances, held\r\nin solution, whose component elements had previously existed in the\r\nprimitive gaseous atmosphere. Thus the early ocean which covered the\r\nwhole earth was in all probability not only very salt, but also quite\r\nthick with other mineral matters close up to the point of saturation. It\r\nwas full of lime, and raw flint, and sulphates, and many other\r\nmiscellaneous bodies. Moreover, it was not only just as salt as at the\r\npresent day, but even a great deal salter. For from that time to this\r\nevaporation has constantly been going on in certain shallow isolated\r\nareas, laying down great beds of gypsum and then of salt, which still\r\nremain in the solid condition, while the water has, of course, been\r\ncorrespondingly purified. The same thing has likewise happened in a\r\nslightly different way with the lime and flint, which have been\r\nseparated from the water chiefly by living animals, and afterwards\r\ndeposited on the bottom of the ocean in immense layers as limestone,\r\nchalk, sandstone, and clay.\r\n\r\nThus it turns out that in the end all our sources of salt-supply are\r\nalike ultimately derived from the briny ocean. Whether we dig it out as\r\nsolid rock-salt from the open quarries of the Punjaub, or pump it up\r\nfrom brine-wells sunk into the triassic rocks of Cheshire, or evaporate\r\nit direct in the salt-pans of England and the shallow _salines_ of the\r\nMediterranean shore, it is still at bottom essentially sea-salt.\r\nHowever distant the connection may seem, our salt is always in the last\r\nresort obtained from the material held in solution in some ancient or\r\nmodern sea. Even the saline springs of Canada and the Northern States of\r\nAmerica, where the wapiti love to congregate, and the noble hunter lurks\r\nin the thicket to murder them unperceived, derive their saltness, as an\r\nable Canadian geologist has shown, from the thinly scattered salts still\r\nretained among the sediments of that very archaic sea whose precipitates\r\nform the earliest known life-bearing rocks. To the Homeric Greek, as to\r\nMr. Dick Swiveller, the ocean was always the briny: to modern science,\r\non the other hand (which neither of those worthies would probably have\r\nappreciated at its own valuation), the briny is always the oceanic. The\r\nfossil food which we find to-day on all our dinner-tables dates back its\r\norigin primarily to the first seas that ever covered the surface of our\r\nplanet, and secondarily to the great rock deposits of the dried-up\r\ntriassic inland sea. And yet even our men of science habitually describe\r\nthat ancient mineral as common salt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOGBURY BARROWS\r\n\r\n\r\nWe went to Ogbury Barrows on an archæological expedition. And as the\r\nvery name of archæology, owing to a serious misconception incidental to\r\nhuman nature, is enough to deter most people from taking any further\r\ninterest in our proceedings when once we got there, I may as well begin\r\nby explaining, for the benefit of those who have never been to one, the\r\nmethod and manner of an archæological outing.\r\n\r\nThe first thing you have to do is to catch your secretary. The genuine\r\nsecretary is born, not made; and therefore you have got to catch him,\r\nnot to appoint him. Appointing a secretary is pure vanity and vexation\r\nof spirit; you must find the right man made ready to your hand; and when\r\nyou have found him you will soon see that he slips into the onerous\r\nduties of the secretariat as if to the manner born, by pure instinct.\r\nThe perfect secretary is an urbane old gentleman of mature years and\r\nportly bearing, a dignified representative of British archæology, with\r\nplenty of money and plenty of leisure, possessing a heaven-born genius\r\nfor organisation, and utterly unhampered by any foolish views of his own\r\nabout archæological research or any other kindred subject. The secretary\r\nwho archæologises is lost. His business is not to discourse of early\r\nEnglish windows or of palæolithic hatchets, of buried villas or of\r\nPlantagenet pedigrees, of Roman tile-work or of dolichocephalic skulls,\r\nbut to provide abundant brakes, drags, and carriages, to take care that\r\nthe owners of castles and baronial residences throw them open (with\r\nlunch provided) to the ardent student of British antiquities, to see\r\nthat all the old ladies have somebody to talk to, and all the young ones\r\nsomebody to flirt with, and generally to superintend the morals,\r\nhappiness, and personal comfort of some fifty assorted scientific\r\nenthusiasts. The secretary who diverges from these his proper and\r\nelevated functions into trivial and puerile disquisitions upon the\r\nantiquity of man (when he ought rather to be admiring the juvenility of\r\nwoman), or the precise date of the Anglo-Saxon conquest (when he should\r\nby rights be concentrating the whole force of his massive intellect upon\r\nthe arduous task of arranging for dinner), proves himself at once\r\nunworthy of his high position, and should forthwith be deposed from the\r\nsecretariat by public acclamation.\r\n\r\nHaving once entrapped your perfect secretary, you set him busily to work\r\nbeforehand to make all the arrangements for your expected excursion, the\r\narchæologists generally cordially recognising the important principle\r\nthat he pays all the expenses he incurs out of his own pocket, and\r\ndrives splendid bargains on their account with hotel-keepers, coachmen,\r\nrailway companies, and others to feed, lodge, supply, and convey them at\r\nfabulously low prices throughout the whole expedition. You also\r\nunderstand that the secretary will call upon everybody in the\r\nneighbourhood you propose to visit, induce the rectors to throw open\r\ntheir churches, square the housekeepers of absentee dukes, and beard the\r\nowners of Elizabethan mansions in their own dens. These little\r\npreliminaries being amicably settled, you get together your\r\narchæologists and set out upon your intended tour.\r\n\r\nAn archæologist, it should be further premised, has no necessary\r\npersonal connection with archæology in any way. He (or she) is a human\r\nbeing, of assorted origin, age, and sex, known as an archæologist then\r\nand there on no other ground than the possession of a ticket (price\r\nhalf-a-guinea) for that particular archæological meeting. Who would not\r\nbe a man (or woman) of science on such easy and unexacting terms? Most\r\narchæologists within my own private experience, indeed, are ladies of\r\nvarious ages, many of them elderly, but many more young and pretty,\r\nwhose views about the styles of English architecture or the exact\r\ndistinction between Durotriges and Damnonians are of the vaguest and\r\nmost shadowy possible description. You all drive in brakes together to\r\nthe various points of interest in the surrounding country. When you\r\narrive at a point of interest, somebody or other with a bad cold in his\r\nhead reads a dull paper on its origin and nature, in which there is\r\nfortunately no subsequent examination. If you are burning to learn all\r\nabout it, you put your hand up to your ear, and assume an attitude of\r\nprofound attention. If you are not burning with the desire for\r\ninformation, you stroll off casually about the grounds and gardens with\r\nthe prettiest and pleasantest among the archæological sisters, whose\r\nacquaintance you have made on the way thither. Sometimes it rains, and\r\nthen you obtain an admirable chance of offering your neighbour the\r\nprotection afforded by your brand-new silk umbrella. By-and-by the dull\r\npaper gets finished, and somebody who lives in an adjoining house\r\nvolunteers to provide you with luncheon. Then you adjourn to the parish\r\nchurch, where an old gentleman of feeble eyesight reads a long and\r\ntedious account of all the persons whose monuments are or are not to be\r\nfound upon the walls of that poky little building. Nobody listens to\r\nhim; but everybody carries away a vague impression that some one or\r\nother, temp. Henry the Second, married Adeliza, daughter and heiress of\r\nSir Ralph de Thingumbob, and had issue thirteen stalwart sons and\r\ntwenty-seven beautiful daughters, each founders of a noble family with a\r\ncorrespondingly varied pedigree. Finally, you take tea and ices upon\r\nsomebody's lawn, by special invitation, and drive home, not without much\r\nlaughter, in the cool of the evening to an excellent table d'hôte dinner\r\nat the marvellously cheap hotel, presided over by the ever-smiling and\r\nurbane secretary. That is what we mean nowadays by being a member of an\r\narchæological association.\r\n\r\nIt was on just such a pleasant excursion that we all went to Ogbury\r\nBarrows. I was overflowing, myself, with bottled-up information on the\r\nsubject of those two prehistoric tumuli; for Ogbury Barrows have been\r\nthe hobby of my lifetime; but I didn't read a paper upon their origin\r\nand meaning, first, because the secretary very happily forgot to ask me,\r\nand secondly, because I was much better employed in psychological\r\nresearch into the habits and manners of an extremely pretty\r\npink-and-white archæologist who stood beside me. Instead, therefore, of\r\nboring her and my other companions with all my accumulated store of\r\ninformation about Ogbury Barrows, I locked it up securely in my own\r\nbosom, with the fell design of finally venting it all at once in one\r\nvast flood upon the present article.\r\n\r\nOgbury Barrows, I would have said (had it not been for the praiseworthy\r\nnegligence of our esteemed secretary), stand upon the very verge of a\r\ngreat chalk-down, overlooking a broad and fertile belt of valley, whose\r\nslopes are terraced in the quaintest fashion with long parallel lines of\r\nobviously human and industrial origin. The terracing must have been done\r\na very long time ago indeed, for it is a device for collecting enough\r\nsoil on a chalky hillside to grow corn in. Now, nobody ever tried to\r\ngrow corn on open chalk-downs in any civilised period of history until\r\nthe present century, because the downs are so much more naturally\r\nadapted for sheep-walks that the attempt to turn them into waving\r\ncornfields would never occur to anybody on earth except a barbarian or\r\nan advanced agriculturist. But when Ogbury Downs were originally\r\nterraced, I don't doubt that the primitive system of universal tribal\r\nwarfare still existed everywhere in Britain. This system is aptly summed\r\nup in the familiar modern Black Country formula, 'Yon's a stranger.\r\n'Eave 'arf a brick at him.' Each tribe was then perpetually at war with\r\nevery other tribe on either side of it: a simple plan which rendered\r\nforeign tariffs quite unnecessary, and most effectually protected home\r\nindustries. The consequence was, each district had to produce for its\r\nown tribe all the necessaries of life, however ill-adapted by nature for\r\ntheir due production: because traffic and barter did not yet exist, and\r\nthe only form ever assumed by import trade was that of raiding on your\r\nneighbours' territories, and bringing back with you whatever you could\r\nlay hands on. So the people of the chalky Ogbury valley had perforce to\r\ngrow corn for themselves, whether nature would or nature wouldn't; and,\r\nin order to grow it under such very unfavourable circumstances of soil\r\nand climate, they terraced off the entire hillside, by catching the silt\r\nas it washed slowly down, and keeping it in place by artificial\r\nbarriers.\r\n\r\nOn the top of the down, overlooking this curious vale of prehistoric\r\nterraces, rise the twin heights of Ogbury Barrows, familiar landmarks to\r\nall the country side around for many miles. One of them is a tall,\r\ncircular mound or tumulus surrounded by a deep and well-marked trench:\r\nthe other, which stands a little on one side, is long and narrow, shaped\r\nexactly like a modern grave, but of comparatively gigantic and colossal\r\nproportions. Even the little children of Ogbury village have noticed\r\nits close resemblance of shape and outline to the grassy hillocks in\r\ntheir own churchyard, and whisper to one another when they play upon its\r\nsummit that a great giant in golden armour lies buried in a stone vault\r\nunderneath. But if only they knew the real truth, they would say instead\r\nthat that big, ungainly, overgrown grave covers the remains of a short,\r\nsquat, dwarfish chieftain, akin in shape and feature to the Lapps and\r\nFinns, and about as much unlike a giant as human nature could easily\r\nmanage. It maybe regarded as a general truth of history that the\r\ngreatest men don't by any means always get the biggest monument.\r\n\r\nThe archæologists in becoming prints who went with us to the top of\r\nOgbury Barrows sagaciously surmised (with demonstrative parasol) that\r\n'these mounds must have been made a very long time ago, indeed.' So in\r\nfact they were: but though they stand now so close together, and look so\r\nmuch like sisters and contemporaries, one is ages older than the other,\r\nand was already green and grass-grown with immemorial antiquity when the\r\nfresh earth of its neighbour tumulus was first thrown up by its side,\r\nabove the buried urn of some long-forgotten Celtic warrior. Let us begin\r\nby considering the oldest first, and then pass on to its younger sister.\r\n\r\nOgbury Long Barrow is a very ancient monument indeed. Not, to be sure,\r\none quarter so ancient as the days of the extremely old master who\r\ncarved the mammoth on the fragments of his own tusk in the caves of the\r\nDordogne, and concerning whom I have indited a discourse in an earlier\r\nportion of this volume: compared with that very antique personage, our\r\nlong barrow on Ogbury hill-top may in fact be looked upon as almost\r\nmodern. Still, when one isn't talking in geological language, ten or\r\ntwenty thousand years may be fairly considered a very long time as time\r\ngoes: and I have little doubt that from ten to twenty thousand years\r\nhave passed since the short, squat chieftain aforesaid was first\r\ncommitted to his final resting-place in Ogbury Long Barrow. Two years\r\nsince, we local archæologists--_not_ in becoming prints this\r\ntime--opened the barrow to see what was inside it. We found, as we\r\nexpected, the 'stone vault' of the popular tradition, proving\r\nconclusively that some faint memory of the original interment had clung\r\nfor all those long years around the grassy pile of that ancient tumulus.\r\nIts centre, in fact, was occupied by a sepulchral chamber built of big\r\nSarsen stones from the surrounding hillsides; and in the midst of the\r\nhouse of death thus rudely constructed lay the mouldering skeleton of\r\nits original possessor--an old prehistoric Mongoloid chieftain. When I\r\nstood for the first moment within that primæval palace of the dead,\r\nnever before entered by living man for a hundred centuries, I felt, I\r\nmust own, something like a burglar, something like a body-snatcher,\r\nsomething like a resurrection man, but most of all like a happy\r\narchæologist.\r\n\r\nThe big stone hut in which we found ourselves was, in fact, a buried\r\ncromlech, covered all over (until we opened it) by the earth of the\r\nbarrow. Almost every cromlech, wherever found, was once, I believe, the\r\ncentral chamber of just such a long barrow: but in some instances wind\r\nand rain have beaten down and washed away the surrounding earth (and\r\nthen we call it a 'Druidical monument'), while in others the mound still\r\nencloses its original deposit (and then we call it merely a prehistoric\r\ntumulus). As a matter of fact, even the Druids themselves are quite\r\nmodern and commonplace personages compared with the short, squat\r\nchieftains of the long barrows. For all the indications we found in the\r\nlong barrow at Ogbury (as in many others we had opened elsewhere) led us\r\nat once to the strange conclusion that our new acquaintance, the\r\nskeleton, had once been a living cannibal king of the newer stone-age in\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\nThe only weapons or implements we could discover in the barrow were two\r\nneatly chipped flint arrowheads, and a very delicate ground greenstone\r\nhatchet, or tomahawk. These were the weapons of the dead chief, laid\r\nbeside him in the stone chamber where we found his skeleton, for his\r\nfuture use in his underground existence. A piece or two of rude\r\nhand-made pottery, no doubt containing food and drink for the ghost, had\r\nalso been placed close to his side: but they had mouldered away with\r\ntime and damp, till it was quite impossible to recover more than a few\r\nbroken and shapeless fragments. There was no trace of metal in any way:\r\nwhereas if the tribesmen of our friend the skeleton had known at all the\r\nart of smelting, we may be sure some bronze axe or spearhead would have\r\ntaken the place of the flint arrows and the greenstone tomahawk: for\r\nsavages always bury a man's best property together with his corpse,\r\nwhile civilised men take care to preserve it with pious care in their\r\nown possession, and to fight over it strenuously in the court of\r\nprobate.\r\n\r\nThe chief's own skeleton lay, or rather squatted, in the most\r\nundignified attitude, in the central chamber. His people when they put\r\nhim there evidently considered that he was to sit at his ease, as he had\r\nbeen accustomed to do in his lifetime, in the ordinary savage squatting\r\nposition, with his knees tucked up till they reached his chin, and his\r\nbody resting entirely on the heels and haunches. The skeleton was\r\nentire: but just outside and above the stone vault we came upon a number\r\nof other bones, which told another and very different story. Some of\r\nthem were the bones of the old prehistoric short-horned ox: others\r\nbelonged to wild boars, red deer, and sundry similar animals, for the\r\nmost part skulls and feet only, the relics of the savage funeral feast.\r\nIt was clear that as soon as the builders of the barrow had erected the\r\nstone chamber of their dead chieftain, and placed within it his honoured\r\nremains, they had held a great banquet on the spot, and, after killing\r\noxen and chasing red deer, had eaten all the eatable portions, and\r\nthrown the skulls, horns, and hoofs on top of the tomb, as offerings to\r\nthe spirit of their departed master. But among these relics of the\r\nfuneral baked meats there were some that specially attracted our\r\nattention--a number of broken human skulls, mingled indiscriminately\r\nwith the horns of deer and the bones of oxen. It was impossible to look\r\nat them for a single moment, and not to recognise that we had here the\r\nveritable remains of a cannibal feast, a hundred centuries ago, on\r\nOgbury hill-top.\r\n\r\nEach skull was split or fractured, not clean cut, as with a sword or\r\nbullet, but hacked and hewn with some blunt implement, presumably either\r\na club or a stone tomahawk. The skull of the great chief inside was\r\nentire and his skeleton unmutilated: but we could see at a glance that\r\nthe remains we found huddled together on the top were those of slaves or\r\nprisoners of war, sacrificed beside the dead chieftain's tomb, and eaten\r\nwith the other products of the chase by his surviving tribesmen. In an\r\ninner chamber behind the chieftain's own hut we came upon yet a stranger\r\nrelic of primitive barbarism. Two complete human skeletons squatted\r\nthere in the same curious attitude as their lord's, as if in attendance\r\nupon him in a neighbouring ante-chamber. They were the skeletons of\r\nwomen--so our professional bone-scanner immediately told us--and each of\r\ntheir skulls had been carefully cleft right down the middle by a single\r\nblow from a sharp stone hatchet. But they were not the victims intended\r\nfor the _pièce de résistance_ at the funeral banquet. They were clearly\r\nthe two wives of the deceased chieftain, killed on his tomb by his son\r\nand successor, in order to accompany their lord and master in his new\r\nlife underground as they had hitherto done in his rude wooden palace on\r\nthe surface of the middle earth.\r\n\r\nWe covered up the reopened sepulchre of the old cannibal savage king\r\n(after abstracting for our local museum the arrowheads and tomahawk, as\r\nwell as the skull of the very ancient Briton himself), and when our\r\narchæological society, ably led by the esteemed secretary, stood two\r\nyears later on the desecrated tomb, the grass had grown again as green\r\nas ever, and not a sign remained of the sacrilegious act in which one of\r\nthe party then assembled there had been a prime actor. Looking down from\r\nthe summit of the long barrow on that bright summer morning, over the\r\ngay group of picnicking archæologists, it was a curious contrast to\r\nreinstate in fancy the scene at that first installation of the Ogbury\r\nmonument. In my mind's eye I saw once more the howling band of naked,\r\nyellow-faced and yellow-limbed savages surge up the terraced slopes of\r\nOgbury Down; I saw them bear aloft, with beating of breasts and loud\r\ngesticulations, the bent corpse of their dead chieftain; I saw the\r\nterrified and fainting wives haled along by thongs of raw oxhide, and\r\nthe weeping prisoners driven passively like sheep to the slaughter; I\r\nsaw the fearful orgy of massacre and rapine around the open tumulus, the\r\nwild priest shattering with his gleaming tomahawk the skulls of his\r\nvictims, the fire of gorse and low brushwood prepared to roast them, the\r\nheads and feet flung carelessly on top of the yet uncovered stone\r\nchamber, the awful dance of blood-stained cannibals around the mangled\r\nremains of men and oxen, and finally the long task of heaping up above\r\nthe stone hut of the dead king the earthen mound that was never again to\r\nbe opened to the light of day till, ten thousand years later, we modern\r\nBritons invaded with our prying, sacrilegious mattock the sacred privacy\r\nof that cannibal ghost. All this passed like a vision before my mind's\r\neye; but I didn't mention anything of it at that particular moment to my\r\nfellow-archæologists, because I saw they were all much more interested\r\nin the pigeon-pie and the funny story about an exalted personage and a\r\ndistinguished actress with which the model secretary was just then duly\r\nentertaining them.\r\n\r\nFive thousand years or so slowly wore away, from the date of the\r\nerection of the long barrow, and a new race had come to occupy the soil\r\nof England, and had driven away or reduced to slavery the short, squat,\r\nyellow-skinned cannibals of the earlier epoch. They were a pastoral and\r\nagricultural people, these new comers, acquainted with the use and abuse\r\nof bronze, and far more civilised in every way than their darker\r\npredecessors. No trace remains behind to tell us now by what fierce\r\nonslaught the Celtic invaders--for the bronze-age folk were presumably\r\nCelts--swept through the little Ogbury valley, and brained the men of\r\nthe older race, while they made slaves of the younger women and\r\nserviceable children. Nothing now stands to tell us anything of the long\r\nyears of Celtic domination, except the round barrow on the bare down,\r\njust as green and as grass-grown nowadays as its far earlier and more\r\nprimitive neighbour.\r\n\r\nWe opened the Ogbury round barrow at the same time as the other, and\r\nfound in it, as we expected, no bones or skeleton of any sort, broken or\r\notherwise, but simply a large cinerary urn. The urn was formed of coarse\r\nhand-made earthenware, very brittle by long burial in the earth, but not\r\nby any means so old or porous as the fragments we had discovered in the\r\nlong barrow. A pretty pattern ran round its edge--a pattern in the\r\nsimplest and most primitive style of ornamentation; for it consisted\r\nmerely of the print of the potter's thumb-nail, firmly pressed into the\r\nmoist clay before baking. Beside the urn lay a second specimen of early\r\npottery, one of those curious perforated jars which antiquaries call by\r\nthe very question-begging name of incense-cups; and within it we\r\ndiscovered the most precious part of all our 'find,' a beautiful\r\nwedge-shaped bronze hatchet, and three thin gold beads. Having no\r\nconsideration for the feelings of the ashes, we promptly appropriated\r\nboth hatchet and beads, and took the urn and cup as a peace-offering to\r\nthe lord of the manor for our desecration of a tomb (with his full\r\nconsent) on the land of his fathers.\r\n\r\nWhy did these bronze-age people burn instead of burying their dead? Why\r\ndid they anticipate the latest fashionable mode of disposal of corpses,\r\nand go in for cremation with such thorough conviction? They couldn't\r\nhave been influenced by those rather unpleasant sanitary considerations\r\nwhich so profoundly agitated the mind of 'Graveyard Walker.' Sanitation\r\nwas still in a very rudimentary state in the year five thousand B.C.;\r\nand the ingenious Celt, who is still given to 'waking' his neighbours,\r\nwhen they die of small-pox, with a sublime indifference to the chances\r\nof infection, must have had some other and more powerful reason for\r\nadopting the comparatively unnatural system of cremation in preference\r\nto that of simple burial. The change, I believe, was due to a further\r\ndevelopment of religious ideas on the part of the Celtic tribesmen above\r\nthat of the primitive stone-age cannibals.\r\n\r\nWhen men began to bury their dead, they did so in the firm belief in\r\nanother life, which life was regarded as the exact counterpart of this\r\npresent one. The unsophisticated savage, holding that in that equal sky\r\nhis faithful dog would bear him company, naturally enough had the dog\r\nin question killed and buried with him, in order that it might follow\r\nhim to the happy hunting-grounds. Clearly, you can't hunt without your\r\narrows and your tomahawk; so the flint weapons and the trusty bow\r\naccompanied their owner in his new dwelling-place. The wooden haft, the\r\ndeer-sinew bow-string, the perishable articles of food and drink have\r\nlong since decayed within the damp tumulus: but the harder stone and\r\nearthenware articles have survived till now, to tell the story of that\r\ncrude and simple early faith. Very crude and illogical indeed it was,\r\nhowever, for it is quite clear that the actual body of the dead man was\r\nthought of as persisting to live a sort of underground life within the\r\nbarrow. A stone hut was constructed for its use; real weapons and\r\nimplements were left by its side; and slaves and wives were ruthlessly\r\nmassacred, as still in Ashantee, in order that their bodies might\r\naccompany the corpse of the buried master in his subterranean dwelling.\r\nIn all this we have clear evidence of a very inconsistent, savage,\r\nmaterialistic belief, not indeed in the immortality of the soul, but in\r\nthe continued underground life of the dead body.\r\n\r\nWith the progress of time, however, men's ideas upon these subjects\r\nbegan to grow more definite and more consistent. Instead of the corpse,\r\nwe get the ghost; instead of the material underground world, we get the\r\nidealised and sublimated conception of a shadowy Hades, a world of\r\nshades, a realm of incorporeal, disembodied spirits. With the growth of\r\nthe idea in this ghostly nether world, there arises naturally the habit\r\nof burning the dead in order fully to free the liberated spirit from the\r\nearthly chains that clog and bind it. It is, indeed, a very noticeable\r\nfact that wherever this belief in a world of shades is implicitly\r\naccepted, there cremation follows as a matter of course; while wherever\r\n(among savage or barbaric races) burial is practised, there a more\r\nmaterialistic creed of bodily survival necessarily accompanies it. To\r\ncarry out this theory to its full extent, not only must the body itself\r\nbe burnt, but also all its belongings with it. Ghosts are clothed in\r\nghostly clothing; and the question has often been asked of modern\r\nspiritualists by materialistic scoffers, 'Where do the ghosts get their\r\ncoats and dresses?' The true believer in cremation and the shadowy world\r\nhas no difficulty at all in answering that crucial inquiry; he would say\r\nat once, 'They are the ghosts of the clothes that were burnt with the\r\nbody.' In the gossiping story of Periander, as veraciously retailed for\r\nus by that dear old grandmotherly scandalmonger, Herodotus, the shade of\r\nMelissa refuses to communicate with her late husband, by medium or\r\notherwise, on the ground that she found herself naked and shivering with\r\ncold, because the garments buried with her had not been burnt, and\r\ntherefore were of no use to her in the world of shades. So Periander, to\r\nput a stop to this sad state of spiritual destitution, requisitioned all\r\nthe best dresses of the Corinthian ladies, burnt them bodily in a great\r\ntrench, and received an immediate answer from the gratified shade, who\r\nwas thenceforth enabled to walk about in the principal promenades of\r\nHades among the best-dressed ghosts of that populous quarter.\r\n\r\nThe belief which thus survived among the civilised Greeks of the age of\r\nthe Despots is shared still by Fijis and Karens, and was derived by all\r\nin common from early ancestors of like faith with the founders of Ogbury\r\nround barrow. The weapons were broken and the clothes burnt, to liberate\r\ntheir ghosts into the world of spirits, just as now, in Fiji, knives and\r\naxes have their spiritual counterparts, which can only be released when\r\nthe material shape is destroyed or purified by the action of fire.\r\nEverything, in such a state, is supposed to possess a soul of its own;\r\nand the fire is the chosen mode for setting the soul free from all\r\nclogging earthly impurities. So till yesterday, in the rite of suttee,\r\nthe Hindoo widow immolated herself upon her husband's pyre, in order\r\nthat her spirit might follow him unhampered to the world of ghosts\r\nwhither he was bound. Thus the twin barrows on Ogbury hillside bridge\r\nover for us two vast epochs of human culture, both now so remote as to\r\nmerge together mentally to the casual eyes of modern observers, but yet\r\nin reality marking in their very shape and disposition an immense, long,\r\nand slow advance of human reason. For just as the long barrow answers in\r\nform to the buried human corpse and the chambered hut that surrounds and\r\nencloses it, so does the round barrow answer in form to the urn\r\ncontaining the calcined ashes of the cremated barbarian. And is it not a\r\nsuggestive fact that when we turn to the little graveyard by the church\r\nbelow we find the Christian belief in the resurrection of the body, as\r\nopposed to the pagan belief in the immortality of the soul, once more\r\nbringing us back to the small oblong mound which is after all but the\r\ndwarfed and humbler modern representative of the long barrow? So deep is\r\nthe connection between that familiar shape and the practice of\r\ninhumation that the dwarf long barrow seems everywhere to have come into\r\nuse again throughout all Europe, after whole centuries of continued\r\ncremation, as the natural concomitant and necessary mark of Christian\r\nburial.\r\n\r\nThis is what I would have said, if I had been asked, at Ogbury Barrows.\r\nBut I wasn't asked; so I devoted myself instead to psychological\r\nresearch, and said nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFISH OUT OF WATER\r\n\r\n\r\nStrolling one day in what is euphemistically termed, in equatorial\r\nlatitudes, 'the cool of the evening,' along a tangled tropical American\r\nfield-path, through a low region of lagoons and watercourses, my\r\nattention happened to be momentarily attracted from the monotonous\r\npursuit of the nimble mosquito by a small animal scuttling along\r\nirregularly before me, as if in a great hurry to get out of my way\r\nbefore I could turn him into an excellent specimen. At first sight I\r\ntook the little hopper, in the grey dusk, for one of the common, small\r\ngreen lizards, and wasn't much disposed to pay it any distinguished\r\nshare either of personal or scientific attention. But as I walked on a\r\nlittle further through the dense underbrush, more and more of these\r\nshuffling and scurrying little creatures kept crossing the path,\r\nhastily, all in one direction, and all, as it were, in a formed body or\r\nmarching phalanx. Looking closer, to my great surprise, I found they\r\nwere actually fish out of water, going on a walking tour, for change of\r\nair, to a new residence--genuine fish, a couple of inches long each, not\r\neel-shaped or serpentine in outline, but closely resembling a red mullet\r\nin miniature, though much more beautifully and delicately coloured, and\r\nwith fins and tails of the most orthodox spiny and prickly description.\r\nThey were travelling across country in a bee-line, thousands of them\r\ntogether, not at all like the helpless fish out of water of popular\r\nimagination, but as unconcernedly and naturally as if they had been\r\naccustomed to the overland route for their whole lifetimes, and were\r\nwalking now on the king's highway without let or hindrance.\r\n\r\nI took one up in my hand and examined it more carefully; though the\r\ncatching it wasn't by any means so easy as it sounds on paper, for these\r\nperambulatory fish are thoroughly inured to the dangers and difficulties\r\nof dry land, and can get out of your way when you try to capture them\r\nwith a rapidity and dexterity which are truly surprising. The little\r\ncreatures are very pretty, well-formed catfish, with bright, intelligent\r\neyes, and a body armed all over, like the armadillo's, with a continuous\r\ncoat of hard and horny mail. This coat is not formed of scales, as in\r\nmost fish, but of toughened skin, as in crocodiles and alligators,\r\narranged in two overlapping rows of imbricated shields, exactly like the\r\nround tiles so common on the roofs of Italian cottages. The fish walks,\r\nor rather shambles along ungracefully, by the shuffling movement of a\r\npair of stiff spines placed close behind his head, aided by the steering\r\naction of his tail, and a constant snake-like wriggling motion of his\r\nentire body. Leg spines of somewhat the same sort are found in the\r\ncommon English gurnard, and in this age of Aquariums and Fisheries\r\nExhibitions, most adult persons above the age of twenty-one years must\r\nhave observed the gurnards themselves crawling along suspiciously by\r\ntheir aid at the bottom of a tank at the Crystal Palace or the\r\npolyonymous South Kensington building. But while the European gurnard\r\nonly uses his substitutes for legs on the bed of the ocean, my itinerant\r\ntropical acquaintance (his name, I regret to say, is Callichthys) uses\r\nthem boldly for terrestrial locomotion across the dry lowlands of his\r\nnative country. And while the gurnard has no less than six of these\r\npro-legs, the American land fish has only a single pair with which to\r\naccomplish his arduous journeys. If this be considered as a point of\r\ninferiority in the armour-plated American species, we must remember that\r\nwhile beetles and grasshoppers have as many as six legs apiece, man, the\r\nhead and crown of things, is content to scramble through life\r\nungracefully with no more than two.\r\n\r\nThere are a great many tropical American pond-fish which share these\r\nadventurous gipsy habits of the pretty little Callichthys. Though they\r\nbelong to two distinct groups, otherwise unconnected, the circumstances\r\nof the country they inhabit have induced in both families this queer\r\nfashion of waddling out courageously on dry land, and going on voyages\r\nof exploration in search of fresh ponds and shallows new, somewhere in\r\nthe neighbourhood of their late residence. One kind in particular, the\r\nBrazilian Doras, takes land journeys of such surprising length, that he\r\noften spends several nights on the way, and the Indians who meet the\r\nwandering bands during their migrations fill several baskets full of the\r\nprey thus dropped upon them, as it were, from the kindly clouds.\r\n\r\nBoth Doras and Callichthys, too, are well provided with means of defence\r\nagainst the enemies they may chance to meet during their terrestrial\r\nexcursions; for in both kinds there are the same bony shields along the\r\nsides, securing the little travellers, as far as possible, from attack\r\non the part of hungry piscivorous animals. Doras further utilises its\r\npowers of living out of water by going ashore to fetch dry leaves, with\r\nwhich it builds itself a regular nest, like a bird's, at the beginning\r\nof the rainy season. In this nest the affectionate parents carefully\r\ncover up their eggs, the hope of the race, and watch over them with the\r\nutmost attention. Many other fish build nests in the water, of\r\nmaterials naturally found at the bottom; but Doras, I believe, is the\r\nonly one that builds them on the beach, of materials sought for on the\r\ndry land.\r\n\r\nSuch amphibious habits on the part of certain tropical fish are easy\r\nenough to explain by the fashionable clue of 'adaptation to\r\nenvironment.' Ponds are always very likely to dry up, and so the animals\r\nthat frequent ponds are usually capable of bearing a very long\r\ndeprivation of water. Indeed, our evolutionists generally hold that land\r\nanimals have in every case sprung from pond animals which have gradually\r\nadapted themselves to do without water altogether. Life, according to\r\nthis theory, began in the ocean, spread up the estuaries into the\r\ngreater rivers, thence extended to the brooks and lakes, and finally\r\nmigrated to the ponds, puddles, swamps and marshes, whence it took at\r\nlast, by tentative degrees, to the solid shore, the plains, and the\r\nmountains. Certainly the tenacity of life shown by pond animals is very\r\nremarkable. Our own English carp bury themselves deeply in the mud in\r\nwinter, and there remain in a dormant condition many months entirely\r\nwithout food. During this long hibernating period, they can be preserved\r\nalive for a considerable time out of water, especially if their gills\r\nare, from time to time, slightly moistened. They may then be sent to any\r\naddress by parcels post, packed in wet moss, without serious damage to\r\ntheir constitution; though, according to Dr. Günther, these dissipated\r\nproducts of civilisation prefer to have a piece of bread steeped in\r\nbrandy put into their mouths to sustain them beforehand. In Holland,\r\nwhere the carp are not so sophisticated, they are often kept the whole\r\nwinter through, hung up in a net to keep them from freezing. At first\r\nthey require to be slightly wetted from time to time, just to\r\nacclimatise them gradually to so dry an existence; but after a while\r\nthey adapt themselves cheerfully to their altered circumstances, and\r\nfeed on an occasional frugal meal of bread and milk with Christian\r\nresignation.\r\n\r\nOf all land-frequenting fish, however, by far the most famous is the\r\nso-called climbing perch of India, which not only walks bodily out of\r\nthe water, but even climbs trees by means of special spines, near the\r\nhead and tail, so arranged as to stick into the bark and enable it to\r\nwriggle its way up awkwardly, something after the same fashion as the\r\n'looping' of caterpillars. The tree-climber is a small scaly fish,\r\nseldom more than seven inches long; but it has developed a special\r\nbreathing apparatus to enable it to keep up the stock of oxygen on its\r\nterrestrial excursions, which may be regarded as to some extent the\r\nexact converse of the means employed by divers to supply themselves with\r\nair under water. Just above the gills, which form of course its natural\r\nhereditary breathing apparatus, the climbing perch has invented a new\r\nand wholly original water chamber, containing within it a frilled bony\r\norgan, which enables it to extract oxygen from the stored-up water\r\nduring the course of its aërial peregrinations. While on shore it picks\r\nup small insects, worms, and grubs; but it also has vegetarian tastes of\r\nits own, and does not despise fruits and berries. The Indian jugglers\r\ntame the climbing perches and carry them about with them as part of\r\ntheir stock in trade; their ability to live for a long time out of water\r\nmakes them useful confederates in many small tricks which seem very\r\nwonderful to people accustomed to believe that fish die almost at once\r\nwhen taken out of their native element.\r\n\r\nThe Indian snakehead is a closely allied species, common in the shallow\r\nponds and fresh-water tanks of India, where holy Brahmans bathe and\r\ndrink and die and are buried, and most of which dry up entirely during\r\nthe dry season. The snakehead, therefore, has similarly accommodated\r\nhimself to this annual peculiarity in his local habitation by acquiring\r\na special chamber for retaining water to moisten his gills throughout\r\nhis long deprivation of that prime necessary. He lives composedly in\r\nsemi-fluid mud, or lies torpid in the hard baked clay at the bottom of\r\nthe dry tank from which all the water has utterly evaporated in the\r\ndrought of summer. As long as the mud remains soft enough to allow the\r\nfish to rise slowly through it, they come to the surface every now and\r\nthen to take in a good hearty gulp of air, exactly as gold fish do in\r\nEngland when confined with thoughtless or ignorant cruelty in a glass\r\nglobe too small to provide sufficient oxygen for their respiration. But\r\nwhen the mud hardens entirely they hibernate or rather æstivate, in a\r\ndormant condition, until the bursting of the monsoon fills the ponds\r\nonce more with the welcome water. Even in the perfectly dry state,\r\nhowever, they probably manage to get a little air every now and again\r\nthrough the numerous chinks and fissures in the sun-baked mud. Our Aryan\r\nbrother then goes a-fishing playfully with a spade and bucket, and digs\r\nthe snakehead in this mean fashion out of his comfortable lair, with an\r\nultimate view to the manufacture of pillau. In Burmah, indeed, while the\r\nmud is still soft, the ingenious Burmese catch the helpless creatures by\r\na still meaner and more unsportsmanlike device. They spread a large\r\ncloth over the slimy ooze where the snakeheads lie buried, and so cut\r\noff entirely for the moment their supply of oxygen. The poor fish,\r\nhalf-asphyxiated by this unkind treatment, come up gasping to the\r\nsurface under the cloth in search of fresh air, and are then easily\r\ncaught with the hand and tossed into baskets by the degenerate\r\nBuddhists.\r\n\r\nOld Anglo-Indians even say that some of these mud haunting Oriental\r\nfish will survive for many years in a state of suspended animation, and\r\nthat when ponds or jhíls which are known to have been dry for several\r\nsuccessive seasons are suddenly filled by heavy rains, they are found to\r\nbe swarming at once with full-grown snakeheads released in a moment from\r\nwhat I may venture to call their living tomb in the hardened bottom.\r\nWhether such statements are absolutely true or not the present deponent\r\nwould be loth to decide dogmatically; but, if we were implicitly to\r\nswallow everything that the old Anglo-Indian in his simplicity assures\r\nus he has seen--well, the clergy would have no further cause any longer\r\nto deplore the growing scepticism and unbelief of these latter\r\nunfaithful ages.\r\n\r\nThis habit of lying in the mud and there becoming torpid may be looked\r\nupon as a natural alternative to the habit of migrating across country,\r\nwhen your pond dries up, in search of larger and more permanent sheets\r\nof water. Some fish solve the problem how to get through the dry season\r\nin one of these two alternative fashions and some in the other. In flat\r\ncountries where small ponds and tanks alone exist, the burying plan is\r\nalmost universal; in plains traversed by large rivers or containing\r\nconsiderable scattered lakes, the migratory system finds greater favour\r\nwith the piscine population.\r\n\r\nOne tropical species which adopts the tactics of hiding itself in the\r\nhard clay, the African mud-fish, is specially interesting to us human\r\nbeings on two accounts--first, because, unlike almost all other kinds of\r\nfish, it possesses lungs as well as gills; and, secondly, because it\r\nforms an intermediate link between the true fish and the frogs or\r\namphibians, and therefore stands in all probability in the direct line\r\nof human descent, being the living representative of one among our own\r\nremote and early ancestors. Scientific interest and filial piety ought\r\nalike to secure our attention for the African mud-fish. It lives its\r\namphibious life among the rice-fields on the Nile, the Zambesi, and the\r\nGambia, and is so greatly given to a terrestrial existence that its\r\nswim-bladder has become porous and cellular, so as to be modified into a\r\npair of true and serviceable lungs. In fact, the lungs themselves in all\r\nthe higher animals are merely the swim-bladders of fish, slightly\r\naltered so as to perform a new but closely allied office. The mud-fish\r\nis common enough in all the larger English aquariums, owing to a\r\nconvenient habit in which it indulges, and which permits it to be\r\nreadily conveyed to all parts of the globe on the same principle as the\r\nvans for furniture. When the dry season comes on and the rice-fields are\r\nreduced to banks of baking mud, the mud-fish retire to the bottom of\r\ntheir pools, where they form for themselves a sort of cocoon of hardened\r\nclay, lined with mucus, and with a hole at each end to admit the air;\r\nand in this snug retreat they remain torpid till the return of wet\r\nweather. As the fish usually reach a length of three or four feet, the\r\ncocoons are of course by no means easy to transport entire. Nevertheless\r\nthe natives manage to dig them up whole, fish and all; and if the\r\ncapsules are not broken, the unconscious inmates can be sent across by\r\nsteamer to Europe with perfect safety. Their astonishment when they\r\nfinally wake up after their long slumber, and find themselves inspecting\r\nthe British public, as introduced to them by Mr. Farini, through a sheet\r\nof plate-glass, must be profound and interesting.\r\n\r\nIn England itself, on the other hand, we have at least one kind of fish\r\nwhich exemplifies the opposite or migratory solution of the dry pond\r\nproblem, and that is our familiar friend the common eel. The ways of\r\neels are indeed mysterious, for nobody has ever yet succeeded in\r\ndiscovering where, when, or how they manage to spawn; nobody has ever\r\nyet seen an eel's egg, or caught a female eel in the spawning condition,\r\nor even observed a really adult male or female specimen of perfect\r\ndevelopment. All the eels ever found in fresh water are immature and\r\nundeveloped creatures. But eels do certainly spawn somewhere or other in\r\nthe deep sea, and every year, in the course of the summer, flocks of\r\nyoung ones, known as elvers, ascend the rivers in enormous quantities,\r\nlike a vast army under numberless leaders. At each tributary or\r\naffluent, be it river, brook, stream, or ditch, a proportionate\r\ndetachment of the main body is given off to explore the various\r\nbranches, while the central force wriggles its way up the chief channel,\r\nregardless of obstacles, with undiminished vigour. When the young elvers\r\ncome to a weir, a wall, a floodgate, or a lasher, they simply squirm\r\ntheir way up the perpendicular barrier with indescribable wrigglings, as\r\nif they were wholly unacquainted, physically as well as mentally, with\r\nNewton's magnificent discovery of gravitation. Nothing stops them; they\r\ngo wherever water is to be found; and though millions perish hopelessly\r\nin the attempt, millions more survive in the end to attain their goal in\r\nthe upper reaches. They even seem to scent ponds or lakes mysteriously,\r\nat a distance, and will strike boldly straight across country, to sheets\r\nof water wholly cut off from communication with the river which forms\r\ntheir chief highway.\r\n\r\nThe full-grown eels are also given to journeying across country in a\r\nmore sober, sedate, and dignified manner, as becomes fish which have\r\nfully arrived at years, or rather months, of discretion. When the ponds\r\nin which they live dry up in summer, they make in a bee-line for the\r\nnearest sheet of fresh water, whose direction and distance they appear\r\nto know intuitively, through some strange instinctive geographical\r\nfaculty. On their way across country, they do not despise the succulent\r\nrat, whom they swallow whole when caught with great gusto. To keep their\r\ngills wet during these excursions, eels have the power of distending the\r\nskin on each side of the neck, just below the head, so as to form a big\r\npouch or swelling. This pouch they fill with water, to carry a good\r\nsupply along with them, until they reach the ponds for which they are\r\nmaking. It is the pouch alone that enables eels to live so long out of\r\nwater under all circumstances, and so incidentally exposes them to the\r\ndisagreeable experience of getting skinned alive, which it is to be\r\nfeared still forms the fate of most of those that fall into the clutches\r\nof the human species.\r\n\r\nA far more singular walking fish than any of these is the odd creature\r\nthat rejoices (unfortunately) in the very classical surname of\r\nPeriophthalmus, which is, being interpreted, Stare-about. (If he had a\r\nrecognised English name of his own, I would gladly give it; but as he\r\nhasn't, and as it is clearly necessary to call him something, I fear we\r\nmust stick to the somewhat alarming scientific nomenclature.)\r\nPeriophthalmus, then, is an odd fish of the tropical Pacific shores,\r\nwith a pair of very distinct forelegs (theoretically described as\r\nmodified pectoral fins), and with two goggle eyes, which he can protrude\r\nat pleasure right outside the sockets, so as to look in whatever\r\ndirection he chooses, without even taking the trouble to turn his head\r\nto left or right, backward or forward. At ebb tide this singular\r\nperipatetic goby literally walks straight out of the water, and\r\npromenades the bare beach erect on two legs, in search of small crabs\r\nand other stray marine animals left behind by the receding waters. If\r\nyou try to catch him, he hops away briskly much like a frog, and stares\r\nback at you grimly over his left shoulder, with his squinting optics.\r\nSo completely adapted is he for this amphibious long-shore existence,\r\nthat his big eyes, unlike those of most other fish, are formed for\r\nseeing in the air as well as in the water. Nothing can be more ludicrous\r\nthan to watch him suddenly thrusting these very movable orbs right out\r\nof their sockets like a pair of telescopes, and twisting them round in\r\nall directions so as to see in front, behind, on top, and below, in one\r\ndelightful circular sweep.\r\n\r\nThere is also a certain curious tropical American carp which, though it\r\nhardly deserves to be considered in the strictest sense as a fish out of\r\nwater, yet manages to fall nearly half-way under that peculiar category,\r\nfor it always swims with its head partly above the surface and partly\r\nbelow. But the funniest thing in this queer arrangement is the fact that\r\none half of each eye is out in the air and the other half is beneath in\r\nthe water. Accordingly, the eye is divided horizontally by a dark strip\r\ninto two distinct and unlike portions, the upper one of which has a\r\npupil adapted to vision in the air alone, while the lower is adapted to\r\nseeing in the water only. The fish, in fact, always swims with its eye\r\nhalf out of the water, and it can see as well on dry land as in its\r\nnative ocean. Its name is Anableps, but in all probability it does not\r\nwish the fact to be generally known.\r\n\r\nThe flying fish are fish out of water in a somewhat different and more\r\ntransitory sense. Their aërial excursions are brief and rapid; they can\r\nonly fly a very little way, and have soon to take once more for safety\r\nto their own more natural and permanent element. More than forty kinds\r\nof the family are known, in appearance very much like English herrings,\r\nbut with the front fins expanded and modified into veritable wings. It\r\nis fashionable nowadays among naturalists to assert that the flying fish\r\ndon't fly; that they merely jump horizontally out of the water with a\r\npowerful impulse, and fall again as soon as the force of the first\r\nimpetus is entirely spent. When men endeavour to persuade you to such\r\nfolly, believe them not. For my own part, I have _seen_ the flying fish\r\nfly--deliberately fly, and flutter, and rise again, and change the\r\ndirection of their flight in mid-air, exactly after the fashion of a big\r\ndragonfly. If the other people who have watched them haven't succeeded\r\nin seeing them fly, that is their own fault, or at least their own\r\nmisfortune; perhaps their eyes weren't quick enough to catch the rapid,\r\nthough to me perfectly recognisable, hovering and fluttering of the\r\ngauze-like wings; but I have seen them myself, and I maintain that on\r\nsuch a question one piece of positive evidence is a great deal better\r\nthan a hundred negative. The testimony of all the witnesses who didn't\r\nsee the murder committed is as nothing compared with the single\r\ntestimony of the one man who really did see it. And in this case I have\r\nmet with many other quick observers who fully agreed with me, against\r\nthe weight of scientific opinion, that they have seen the flying fish\r\nreally fly with their own eyes, and no mistake about it. The German\r\nprofessors, indeed, all think otherwise; but then the German professors\r\nall wear green spectacles, which are the outward and visible sign of\r\n'blinded eyesight poring over miserable books.' The unsophisticated\r\nvision of the noble British seaman is unanimously with me on the matter\r\nof the reality of the fishes' flight.\r\n\r\nAnother group of very interesting fish out of water are the flying\r\ngurnards, common enough in the Mediterranean and the tropical Atlantic.\r\nThey are much heavier and bigger creatures than the true flying fish of\r\nthe herring type, being often a foot and a half long, and their wings\r\nare much larger in proportion, though not, I think, really so powerful\r\nas those of their pretty little silvery rivals. All the flying fish fly\r\nonly of necessity, not from choice. They leave the water when pursued\r\nby their enemies, or when frightened by the rapid approach of a big\r\nsteamer. So swiftly do they fly, however, that they can far outstrip a\r\nship going at the rate of ten knots an hour; and I have often watched\r\none keep ahead of a great Pacific liner under full steam for many\r\nminutes together in quick successive flights of three or four hundred\r\nfeet each. Oddly enough, they can fly further against the wind than\r\nbefore it--a fact acknowledged even by the spectacled Germans\r\nthemselves, and very hard indeed to reconcile with the orthodox belief\r\nthat they are not flying at all, but only jumping. I don't know whether\r\nthe flying gurnards are good eating or not; but the silvery flying fish\r\nare caught for market (sad desecration of the poetry of nature!) in the\r\nWindward Islands, and when nicely fried in egg and bread-crumb are\r\nreally quite as good for practical purposes as smelts or whiting or any\r\nother prosaic European substitute.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, it will be clear, I think, to the impartial reader from\r\nthis rapid survey that the helplessness and awkwardness of a fish out of\r\nwater has been much exaggerated by the thoughtless generalisation of\r\nunscientific humanity. Granting, for argument's sake, that most fish\r\nprefer the water, as a matter of abstract predilection, to the dry land,\r\nit must be admitted _per contra_ that many fish cut a much better figure\r\non terra firma than most of their critics themselves would cut in\r\nmid-ocean. There are fish that wriggle across country intrepidly with\r\nthe dexterity and agility of the most accomplished snakes; there are\r\nfish that walk about on open sand-banks, semi-erect on two legs, as\r\neasily as lizards; there are fish that hop and skip on tail and fins in\r\na manner that the celebrated jumping frog himself might have observed\r\nwith envy; and there are fish that fly through the air of heaven with a\r\ngrace and swiftness that would put to shame innumerable species among\r\ntheir feathered competitors. Nay, there are even fish, like some kinds\r\nof eels and the African mud-fish, that scarcely live in the water at\r\nall, but merely frequent wet and marshy places, where they lie snugly in\r\nthe soft ooze and damp earth that line the bottom. If I have only\r\nsucceeded, therefore, in relieving the mind of one sensitive and\r\nretiring fish from the absurd obloquy cast upon its appearance when it\r\nventures away for awhile from its proper element, then, in the pathetic\r\nand prophetic words borrowed from a thousand uncut prefaces, this work\r\nwill not, I trust, have been written in vain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST POTTER\r\n\r\n\r\nCollective humanity owes a great debt of gratitude to the first potter.\r\nBefore his days the art of boiling, though in one sense very simple and\r\nprimitive indeed, was in another sense very complex, cumbersome, and\r\nlengthy. The unsophisticated savage, having duly speared and killed his\r\nantelope, proceeded to light a roaring fire, with flint or drill, by the\r\nside of some convenient lake or river in his tropical jungle. Then he\r\ndug a big hole in the soft mud close to the water's edge, and let the\r\nwater (rather muddy) percolate into it, or sometimes even he plastered\r\nover its bottom with puddled clay. After that, he heated some smooth\r\nround stones red hot in the fire close by, and drawing them out gingerly\r\nbetween two pieces of stick, dropped them one by one, spluttering and\r\nfizzing, into his improvised basin or kettle. This, of course, made the\r\nwater in the hole boil; and the unsophisticated savage thereupon thrust\r\ninto it his joint of antelope, repeating the process over and over again\r\nuntil the sodden meat was completely seethed to taste on the outside. If\r\none application was not sufficient, he gnawed off the cooked meat from\r\nthe surface with his stout teeth, innocent as yet of the dentist's art,\r\nand plunged the underdone core back again, till it exactly suited his\r\nnot over-delicate or dainty fancy.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, the primitive savage, unversed as he was in pastes and\r\nglazes, in moulds and ornaments, did not pass his life entirely devoid\r\nof cups and platters. Coconut shell and calabash rind, horn of ox and\r\nskull of enemy, bamboo-joint and capacious rhomb-shell, all alike, no\r\ndoubt, supplied him with congenial implements for drink or storage. Like\r\nEve in the Miltonic Paradise, there lacked him not fit vessels pure;\r\npicking some luscious tropical fruit, the savoury pulp he chewed, and in\r\nthe rind still as he thirsted scooped the brimming stream. This was\r\nsatisfactory as far as it went, of course, but it was not pottery. He\r\ncouldn't boil his joint for dinner in coco-nut or skull; he had to do it\r\nwith stone pot-boilers, in a rude kettle of puddled clay.\r\n\r\nBut at last one day, that inspired barbarian, the first potter, hit by\r\naccident upon his grand discovery. He had carried some water in a big\r\ncalabash--the hard shell of a tropical fruit whose pulpy centre can be\r\neasily scooped out--and a happy thought suddenly struck him: why not put\r\nthe calabash to boil upon the fire with a little clay smeared outside\r\nit? The savage is conservative, but he loves to save trouble. He tried\r\nthe experiment, and it succeeded admirably. The water boiled, and the\r\ncalabash was not burnt or broken. Our nameless philosopher took the\r\nprimitive vessel off the fire with a forked branch and looked at it\r\ncritically with the delighted eyes of a first inventor. A wonderful\r\nchange had suddenly come over it. He had blundered accidentally upon the\r\nart of pottery. For what is this that has happened to the clay? It went\r\nin soft, brown, and muddy; it has come out hard, red, and stone-like.\r\nThe first potter ruminated and wondered. He didn't fully realise, no\r\ndoubt, what he had actually done; but he knew he had invented a means by\r\nwhich you could put a calabash upon a fire and keep it there without\r\nburning or bursting. That, after all, was at least something.\r\n\r\nAll this, you say (which, in effect, is Dr. Tylor's view), is purely\r\nhypothetical. In one sense, yes; but not in another. We know that most\r\nsavage races still use natural vessels, made of coco-nuts, gourds, or\r\ncalabashes, for everyday purposes of carrying water; and we also know\r\nthat all the simplest and earliest pottery is moulded on the shape of\r\njust such natural jars and bottles. The fact and the theory based on it\r\nare no novelties. Early in the sixteenth century, indeed, the Sieur\r\nGonneville, skipper of Honfleur, sailing round the Cape of Good Hope,\r\nmade his way right across the Southern Ocean to some vague point of\r\nSouth America where he found the people still just in the intermediate\r\nstage between the use of natural vessels and the invention of pottery.\r\nFor these amiable savages (name and habitat unknown) had wooden pots\r\n'plastered with a kind of clay a good finger thick, which prevents the\r\nfire from burning them.' Here we catch industrial evolution in the very\r\nact, and the potter's art in its first infancy, fossilised and\r\ncrystallised, as it were, in an embryo condition, and fixed for us\r\nimmovably by the unprogressive conservatism of a savage tribe. It was\r\nthis curious early observation of evolving keramic art that made\r\nGoguet--an anthropologist born out of due season--first hit upon that\r\nluminous theory of the origin of pottery now all but universally\r\naccepted.\r\n\r\nPlenty of evidence to the same effect is now forthcoming for the modern\r\ninquirer. Among the ancient monuments of the Mississippi valley, Squier\r\nand Davis found the kilns in which the primitive pottery had been baked;\r\nand among their relics were partially burnt pots retaining in part the\r\nrinds of the gourds or calabashes on which they had been actually\r\nmodelled. Along the Gulf of Mexico gourds were also used to give shape\r\nto the pot; and all over the world, even to this day, the gourd form is\r\na very common one for pottery of all sorts, thus pointing back, dimly\r\nand curiously, to the original mode in which fictile ware generally\r\ncame to be invented. In Fiji and in many parts of Africa vessels\r\nmodelled upon natural forms are still universal. Of course all such pots\r\nas these are purely hand-made; the invention of the potter's wheel, now\r\nso indissolubly associated in all our minds with the production of\r\nearthenware, belongs to an infinitely later and almost modern period.\r\n\r\nAnd that consideration naturally suggests the fundamental question, When\r\ndid the first potter live? The world (as Sir Henry Taylor has oracularly\r\ntold us) knows nothing of its greatest men; and the very name of the\r\nfather of all potters has been utterly forgotten in the lapse of ages.\r\nIndeed, paradoxical as it may sound to say so, one may reasonably doubt\r\nwhether there was ever actually any one single man on whom one could\r\ndefinitely lay one's finger, and say with confidence, Here we have the\r\nfirst potter. Pottery, no doubt, like most other things, grew by\r\nimperceptible degrees from wholly vague and rudimentary beginnings. Just\r\nas there were steam-engines before Watt, and locomotives before\r\nStephenson, so there were pots before the first potter. Many men must\r\nhave discovered separately, by half-unconscious trials, that a coat of\r\nmud rudely plastered over the bottom of a calabash prevented it from\r\ncatching fire and spilling its contents; other men slowly learned to\r\nplaster the mud higher and ever higher up the sides; and yet others\r\ngradually introduced and patented new improvements for wholly encasing\r\nthe entire cup in an inch thickness of carefully kneaded clay. Bit by\r\nbit the invention grew, like all great inventions, without any inventor.\r\nThus the question of the date of the first potter practically resolves\r\nitself into the simpler question of the date of the earliest known\r\npottery.\r\n\r\nDid palæolithic man, that antique naked crouching savage who hunted the\r\nmammoth, the reindeer, and the cave-bear among the frozen fields of\r\ninterglacial Gaul and Britain--did palæolithic man himself, in his rude\r\nrock-shelters, possess a knowledge of the art of pottery? That is a\r\nquestion which has been much debated amongst archæologists, and which\r\ncannot even now be considered as finally settled before the tribunal of\r\nscience. He must have drunk out of something or other, but whether he\r\ndrank out of earthenware cups is still uncertain. It is pretty clear\r\nthat the earliest drinking vessels used in Europe were neither bowls of\r\nearthenware nor shells of fruits, for the cold climate of interglacial\r\ntimes did not permit the growth in northern latitudes of such large\r\nnatural vessels as gourds, calabashes, bamboos, or coco-nuts. In all\r\nprobability the horns of the aurochs and the wild cattle, and the\r\ncapacious skull of the fellow-man whose bones he had just picked at his\r\nease for his cannibal supper, formed the aboriginal goblets and basins\r\nof the old black European savage. A curious verbal relic of the use of\r\nhorns as drinking-cups survives indeed down to almost modern times in\r\nthe Greek word _keramic_, still commonly applied to the art of pottery,\r\nand derived, of course, from _keras_, a horn; while as to skulls, not\r\nonly were they frequently used as drinking-cups by our Scandinavian\r\nancestors, but there still exists a very singular intermediate American\r\nvessel in which the clay has actually been moulded on a human skull as\r\nmodel, just as other vessels have been moulded on calabashes or other\r\nsuitable vegetable shapes.\r\n\r\nStill, the balance of evidence certainly seems to show that a little\r\nvery rude and almost shapeless hand-made pottery has really been\r\ndiscovered amongst the buried caves where palæolithic men made for ages\r\ntheir chief dwelling-places. Fragments of earthenware occurred in the\r\nHohefels cave near Ulm, in company with the bones of reindeer,\r\ncave-bears, and mammoths, whose joints had doubtless been duly boiled,\r\na hundred thousand years ago, by the intelligent producer of those\r\nidentical sun-dried fleshpots; and M. Joly, of Toulouse, has in his\r\npossession portions of an irregularly circular, flat-bottomed vessel,\r\nfrom the cave of Nabrigas, on which the finger-marks of the hand that\r\nmoulded the clay are still clearly distinguishable on the baked\r\nearthenware. That is the great merit of pottery, viewed as an historical\r\ndocument; it retains its shape and peculiarities unaltered through\r\ncountless centuries, for the future edification of unborn antiquaries.\r\n_Litera scripta manet_, and so does baked pottery. The hand itself that\r\nformed that rude bowl has long since mouldered away, flesh and bone\r\nalike, into the soil around it; but the print of its fingers, indelibly\r\nfixed by fire into the hardened clay, remains for us still to tell the\r\nstory of that early triumph of nascent keramics.\r\n\r\nThe relics of palæolithic pottery are, however, so very fragmentary, and\r\nthe circumstances under which they have been discovered so extremely\r\ndoubtful, that many cautious and sceptical antiquarians will even now\r\nhave nothing to say to the suspected impostors. Among the remains of the\r\nnewer Stone Age, on the other hand, comparatively abundant keramic\r\nspecimens have been unearthed, without doubt or cavil, from the long\r\nbarrows--the burial-places of the early Mongoloid race, now represented\r\nby the Finns and Lapps, which occupied the whole of Western Europe\r\nbefore the advent of the Aryan vanguard. One of the best bits is a\r\ncurious wide-mouthed, semi-globular bowl from Norton Bavant, in\r\nWiltshire, whose singular shape suggests almost immediately the idea\r\nthat it must at least have been based, if not actually modelled, upon a\r\nhuman skull. Its rim is rough and quite irregular, and there is no trace\r\nof ornamentation of any sort; a fact quite in accordance with all the\r\nother facts we know about the men of the newer Stone Age, who were far\r\nless artistic and æsthetic in every way than their ruder predecessors of\r\nthe interglacial epoch.\r\n\r\nOrnamentation, when it does begin to appear, arises at first in a\r\nstrictly practical and unintentional manner. Later examples elsewhere\r\nshow us by analogy how it first came into existence. The Indians of the\r\nOhio seem to have modelled their pottery in bags or nettings made of\r\ncoarse thread or twisted bark. Those of the Mississippi moulded them in\r\nbaskets of willow or splints. When the moist clay thus shaped and marked\r\nby the indentations of the mould was baked in the kiln, it of course\r\nretained the pretty dappling it received from the interlaced and woven\r\nthrums, which were burnt off in the process of firing. Thus a rude sort\r\nof natural diaper ornament was set up, to which the eye soon became\r\naccustomed, and which it learned to regard as necessary for beauty.\r\nHence, wherever newer and more improved methods of modelling came into\r\nuse, there would arise an instinctive tendency on the part of the early\r\npotter to imitate the familiar marking by artificial means. Dr. Klemm\r\nlong ago pointed out that the oldest German fictile vases have an\r\nornamentation in which plaiting is imitated by incised lines. 'What was\r\nno longer wanted as a necessity,' he says, 'was kept up as an ornament\r\nalone.'\r\n\r\nAnother very simple form of ornamentation, reappearing everywhere all\r\nthe world over on primitive bowls and vases, is the rope pattern, a line\r\nor string-course over the whole surface or near the mouth of the vessel.\r\nMany of the indented patterns on early British pottery have been\r\nproduced, as Sir Daniel Wilson has pointed out, by the close impress of\r\ntwisted cord on the wet clay. Sometimes these cords seem to have been\r\noriginally left on the clay in the process of baking, and used as a\r\nmould; at other times they may have been employed afterwards as\r\nhandles, as is still done in the case of some South African pots: and,\r\nwhen the rope handle wore off, the pattern made by its indentation on\r\nthe plastic material before sun-baking would still remain as pure\r\nornament. Probably the very common idea of string-course ornamentation\r\njust below the mouth or top of vases and bowls has its origin in this\r\nearly and almost universal practice.\r\n\r\nWhen other conscious and intentional ornamentation began to supersede\r\nthese rude natural and undesigned patterns, they were at first mere\r\nrough attempts on the part of the early potter to imitate, with the\r\nsimple means at his disposal, the characteristic marks of the ropes or\r\nwickerwork by which the older vessels were necessarily surrounded. He\r\nhad gradually learned, as Mr. Tylor well puts it, that clay alone or\r\nwith some mixture of sand is capable of being used without any\r\nextraneous support for the manufacture of drinking and cooking vessels.\r\nHe therefore began to model rudely thin globular bowls with his own\r\nhands, dispensing with the aid of thongs or basketwork. But he still\r\nnaturally continued to imitate the original shapes--the gourd, the\r\ncalabash, the plaited net, the round basket; and his eye required the\r\nfamiliar decoration which naturally resulted from the use of some one or\r\nother among these primitive methods. So he tried his hand at deliberate\r\nornament in his own simple untutored fashion.\r\n\r\nIt was quite literally his hand, indeed, that he tried at first; for the\r\nearliest decoration upon paleolithic pottery is made by pressing the\r\nfingers into the clay so as to produce a couple of deep parallel\r\nfurrows, which is the sole attempt at ornament on M. Joly's Nabrigas\r\nspecimen; while the urns and drinking-cups taken from our English long\r\nbarrows are adorned with really pretty and effective patterns, produced\r\nby pressing the tip of the finger and the nail into the plastic\r\nmaterial. It is wonderful what capital and varied results you can get\r\nwith no more recondite graver than the human finger-nail, sometimes\r\nturned front downward, sometimes back downward, and sometimes used to\r\negg up the moist clay into small jagged and relieved designs. Most of\r\nthese patterns are more or less plaitlike in arrangement, evidently\r\nsuggested to the mind of the potter by the primitive marks of the old\r\nbasketwork. But, as time went on, the early artist learned to press into\r\nhis service new implements, pieces of wood, bone scrapers, and the flint\r\nknife itself, with which he incised more regular patterns, straight or\r\nzigzag lines, rows of dots, squares and triangles, concentric circles,\r\nand even the mystic cross and swastika, the sacred symbols of yet unborn\r\nand undreamt-of religions. As yet, there was no direct imitation of\r\nplant or animal forms; once only, on a single specimen from a Swiss lake\r\ndwelling, are the stem and veins of a leaf dimly figured on the\r\nhandiwork of the European prehistoric potter. Ornament in its pure form,\r\nas pattern merely, had begun to exist; imitative work as such was yet\r\nunknown, or almost unknown, to the eastern hemisphere.\r\n\r\nIn America, it was quite otherwise. The forgotten people who built the\r\nmounds of Ohio and the great tumuli of the Mississippi valley decorated\r\ntheir pottery not only with animal figures, such as snakes, fish, frogs,\r\nand turtles, but also with human heads and faces, many of them evidently\r\nmodelled from the life, and some of them quite unmistakably genuine\r\nportraits. On one such vase, found in Arkansas, and figured by the\r\nMarquis de Nadaillac in his excellent work on Prehistoric America, the\r\nornamentation consists (in true Red Indian taste) of skeleton hands,\r\ninterspersed with crossbones; and the delicacy and anatomical\r\ncorrectness of the detail inevitably suggest the idea that the unknown\r\nartist must have worked with the actual hand of his slaughtered enemy\r\nlying for a model on the table before him. Much of the early American\r\npottery is also coloured as well as figured, and that with considerable\r\nreal taste; the pigments were applied, however, after the baking, and so\r\npossess little stability or permanence of character. But pots and vases\r\nof these advanced styles have got so far ahead of the first potter that\r\nwe have really little or no business with them in this paper.\r\n\r\nPrehistoric European pottery has never a spout, but it often indulges in\r\nsome simple form of ear or handle. The very ancient British bowl from\r\nBavant Long Barrow--produced by that old squat Finnlike race which\r\npreceded the 'Ancient Britons' of our old-fashioned school-books--has\r\ntwo ear-shaped handles projecting just below the rim, exactly as in the\r\nmodern form of vessel known as a crock, and still familiarly used for\r\nhousehold purposes. This long survival of a common domestic shape from\r\nthe most remote prehistoric antiquity to our own time is very\r\nsignificant and very interesting. Many of the old British pots have also\r\na hole or two holes pierced through them, near the top, evidently for\r\nthe purpose of putting in a string or rope by way of a handle. With the\r\nround barrows, which belong to the Bronze Age, and contain the remains\r\nof a later and more civilised Celtic population, we get far more\r\nadvanced forms of pottery. Burial here is preceded by cremation, and the\r\nashes are enclosed in urns, many of which are very beautiful in form and\r\nexquisitely decorated. Cremation, as Professor Rolleston used feelingly\r\nto plead, is bad for the comparative anatomist and ethnographer, but it\r\nis passing well for the collector of pottery. Where burning exists as a\r\ncommon practice, there urns are frequent, and pottery an art in great\r\nrequest. Drinking-cups and perforated incense burners accompany the\r\ndead in the round barrows; but the use of the potter's wheel is still\r\nunknown, and all the urns and vases belonging to this age are still\r\nhand-moulded.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious reflection, however, that in spite of all the later\r\nimprovements in the fictile art--in spite of wheels and moulds, pastes\r\nand glazes, stamps and pigments, and all the rest of it--the most\r\nprimitive methods of the first potter are still in use in many\r\ncountries, side by side with the most finished products of modern\r\nEuropean skill and industry. I have in my own possession some West\r\nIndian calabashes, cut and decorated under my own eye by a Jamaican\r\nnegro for his personal use, and bought from him by me for the smallest\r\ncoin there current--calabashes carved round the edge through the rind\r\nwith a rude string-course, exactly like the common rope pattern of\r\nprehistoric pottery. I have seen the same Jamaican negroes kneading\r\ntheir hand-made porous earthenware beside a tropical stream, moulding it\r\non fruits or shaping it inside with a free sweep of the curved hand, and\r\ndrying it for use in the hot sun, or baking it in a hastily-formed kiln\r\nof plastered mud into large coarse jars of prehistoric types, locally\r\nknown by the quaint West African name of 'yabbas.' Many of these yabbas,\r\nif buried in the ground and exposed to damp and frost, till they almost\r\nlost the effects of the baking, would be quite indistinguishable, even\r\nby the skilled archæologist, from the actual handicraft of the\r\npalæolithic potter. The West Indian negroes brought these simple arts\r\nwith them from their African home, where they have been handed down in\r\nunbroken continuity from the very earliest age of fictile industry. New\r\nand better methods have slowly grown up everywhere around them, but\r\nthese simplest, earliest, and easiest plans have survived none the less\r\nfor the most ordinary domestic uses, and will survive for ages yet, as\r\nlong as there remain any out-of-the-way places, remote from the main\r\nstreams of civilised commerce. Thus, while hundreds of thousands of\r\nyears, in all probability, separate us now from the ancient days of the\r\nfirst potter, it is yet possible for us to see the first potter's own\r\nmethods and principles exemplified under our very eyes by people who\r\nderive them in unbroken succession from the direct teaching of that\r\nlong-forgotten prehistoric savage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RECIPE FOR GENIUS\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us start fair by frankly admitting that the genius, like the poet,\r\nis born and not made. If you wish to apply the recipe for producing him,\r\nit is unfortunately necessary to set out by selecting beforehand his\r\ngrandfathers and grandmothers, to the third and fourth generation of\r\nthose that precede him. Nevertheless, there _is_ a recipe for the\r\nproduction of genius, and every actual concrete genius who ever yet\r\nadorned or disgraced this oblate spheroid of ours has been produced, I\r\nbelieve, in strict accordance with its unwritten rules and unknown\r\nregulations. In other words, geniuses don't crop up irregularly\r\nanywhere, 'quite promiscuous like'; they have their fixed laws and their\r\nadequate causes: they are the result and effect of certain fairly\r\ndemonstrable concatenations of circumstance: they are, in short, a\r\nnatural product, not a _lusus naturæ_. You get them only under sundry\r\nrelatively definite and settled conditions; and though it isn't\r\n(unfortunately) quite true that the conditions will always infallibly\r\nbring forth the genius, it is quite true that the genius can never be\r\nbrought forth at all without the conditions. Do men gather grapes of\r\nthorns, or figs of thistles? No more can you get a poet from a family of\r\nstockbrokers who have intermarried with the daughters of an eminent\r\nalderman, or make a philosopher out of a country grocer's eldest son\r\nwhose amiable mother had no soul above the half-pounds of tea and\r\nsugar.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, by way of clearing the decks for action, I am going\r\nto start even by getting rid once for all (so far as we are here\r\nconcerned) of that famous but misleading old distinction between genius\r\nand talent. It is really a distinction without a difference. I suppose\r\nthere is probably no subject under heaven on which so much high-flown\r\nstuff and nonsense has been talked and written as upon this well-known\r\nand much-debated hair-splitting discrimination. It is just like that\r\nother great distinction between fancy and imagination, about which poets\r\nand essayists discoursed so fluently at the beginning of the present\r\ncentury, until at last one fine day the world at large woke up suddenly\r\nto the unpleasant consciousness that it had been wasting its time over a\r\nnon-existent difference, and that fancy and imagination were after all\r\nabsolutely identical. Now, I won't dogmatically assert that talent and\r\ngenius are exactly one and the same thing; but I do assert that genius\r\nis simply talent raised to a slightly higher power; it differs from it\r\nnot in kind but merely in degree: it is talent at its best. There is no\r\ndrawing a hard-and-fast line of demarcation between the two. You might\r\njust as well try to classify all mankind into tall men and short men,\r\nand then endeavour to prove that a real distinction existed in nature\r\nbetween your two artificial classes. As a matter of fact, men differ in\r\nheight and in ability by infinitesimal gradations: some men are very\r\nshort, others rather short, others medium-sized, others tall, and yet\r\nothers again of portentous stature like Mr. Chang and Jacob Omnium. So,\r\ntoo, some men are idiots, some are next door to a fool, some are stupid,\r\nsome are worthy people, some are intelligent, some are clever, and some\r\ngeniuses. But genius is only the culminating point of ordinary\r\ncleverness, and if you were to try and draw up a list of all the real\r\ngeniuses in the last hundred years, no two people could ever be found\r\nto agree among themselves as to which should be included and which\r\nexcluded from the artificial catalogue. I have heard Kingsley and\r\nCharles Lamb described as geniuses, and I have heard them both\r\nabsolutely denied every sort of literary merit. Carlyle thought Darwin a\r\npoor creature, and Comte regarded Hegel himself as an empty windbag.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, most of the grandiose talk about the vast gulf which\r\nseparates genius from mere talent has been published and set abroad by\r\nthose fortunate persons who fell, or fancied themselves to fall, under\r\nthe former highly satisfactory and agreeable category. Genius, in short,\r\nreal or self-suspected, has always been at great pains to glorify itself\r\nat the expense of poor, commonplace, inferior talent. There is a\r\ncertain type of great man in particular which is never tired of dilating\r\nupon the noble supremacy of its own greatness over the spurious\r\nimitation. It offers incense obliquely to itself in offering it\r\ngenerically to the class genius. It brings ghee to its own image. There\r\nare great men, for example, such as Lord Lytton, Disraeli, Victor Hugo,\r\nthe Lion Comique, and Mr. Oscar Wilde, who pose perpetually as great\r\nmen; they cry aloud to the poor silly public so far beneath them, 'I am\r\na genius! Admire me! Worship me!' Against this Byronic self-elevation on\r\nan aërial pedestal, high above the heads of the blind and battling\r\nmultitude, we poor common mortals, who are not unfortunately geniuses,\r\nare surely entitled to enter occasionally our humble protest. Our\r\ncontention is that the genius only differs from the man of ability as\r\nthe man of ability differs from the intelligent man, and the intelligent\r\nman from the worthy person of sound common sense. The sliding scale of\r\nbrains has infinite gradations; and the gradations merge insensibly into\r\none another. There is no gulf, no gap, no sudden jump of nature; here\r\nas elsewhere, throughout the whole range of her manifold productions,\r\nour common mother _saltum non facit_.\r\n\r\nThe question before the house, then, narrows itself down finally to\r\nthis; what are the conditions under which exceptional ability or high\r\ntalent is likely to arise?\r\n\r\nNow, I suppose everybody is ready to admit that two complete born fools\r\nare not at all likely to become the proud father and happy mother of a\r\nShakespeare or a Newton. I suppose everybody will unhesitatingly allow\r\nthat a great mathematician could hardly by any conceivable chance arise\r\namong the South African Bushmen, who cannot understand the arduous\r\narithmetical proposition that two and two make four. No amount of\r\neducation or careful training, I take it, would suffice to elevate the\r\nmost profoundly artistic among the Veddahs of Ceylon, who cannot even\r\ncomprehend an English drawing of a dog or horse, into a respectable\r\npresident of the Royal Academy. It is equally unlikely (as it seems to\r\nme) that a Mendelssohn or a Beethoven could be raised in the bosom of a\r\nfamily all of whose members on either side were incapable (like a\r\ndistinguished modern English poet) of discriminating any one note in an\r\noctave from any other. Such leaps as these would be little short of pure\r\nmiracles. They would be equivalent to the sudden creation, without\r\nantecedent cause, of a whole vast system of nerves and nerve-centres in\r\nthe prodigious brain of some infant phenomenon.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, much of the commonplace, shallow fashionable talk\r\nabout hereditary genius--I don't mean, of course, the talk of our\r\nDarwins and Galtons, but the cheap drawing-room philosophy of easy\r\nsciolists who can't understand them--is itself fully as absurd in its\r\nown way as the idea that something can come out of nothing. For it is no\r\nexplanation of the existence of genius to say that it is hereditary.\r\nYou only put the difficulty one place back. Granting that young Alastor\r\nJones is a budding poet because his father, Percy Bysshe Jones, was a\r\npoet before him, why, pray, was Jones the elder a poet at all, to start\r\nwith? This kind of explanation, in fact, explains nothing; it begins by\r\npositing the existence of one original genius, absolutely unaccounted\r\nfor, and then proceeds blandly to point out that the other geniuses\r\nderive their characteristics from him, by virtue of descent, just as all\r\nthe sons of a peer are born honourables. The elephant supports the\r\nearth, and the tortoise supports the elephant, but who, pray, supports\r\nthe tortoise? If the first chicken came out of an egg, what was the\r\norigin of the hen that laid it?\r\n\r\nBesides, the allegation as it stands is not even a true one. Genius, as\r\nwe actually know it, is by no means hereditary. The great man is not\r\nnecessarily the son of a great man or the father of a great man: often\r\nenough, he stands quite isolated, a solitary golden link in a chain of\r\nbaser metal on either side of him. Mr. John Shakespeare woolstapler, of\r\nStratford-on-Avon, Warwickshire, was no doubt an eminently respectable\r\nperson in his own trade, and he had sufficient intelligence to be mayor\r\nof his native town once upon a time: but, so far as is known, none of\r\nhis literary remains are at all equal to _Macbeth_ or _Othello_. Parson\r\nNewton, of the Parish of Woolsthorpe, in Lincolnshire, may have preached\r\na great many very excellent and convincing discourses, but there is no\r\nevidence of any sort that he ever attempted to write the _Principia_.\r\n_Per contra_ the Miss Miltons, good young ladies that they were (though\r\nof conflicting memory), do not appear to have differed conspicuously in\r\nability from the other Priscillas and Patiences and Mercies amongst whom\r\ntheir lot was cast; while the Marlboroughs and the Wellingtons do not\r\nseem to bud out spontaneously into great commanders in the second\r\ngeneration. True, there are numerous cases such as that of the\r\nHerschels, father and son, or the two Scaligers, or the Caracci, or the\r\nPitts, or the Scipios, and a dozen more, where the genius, once\r\ndeveloped, has persisted for two or three, or even four lives: but these\r\ninstances really cast no light at all upon our central problem, which is\r\njust this--How does the genius come in the first place to be developed\r\nat all from parents in whom individually no particular genius is\r\nultimately to be seen?\r\n\r\nSuppose we take, to start with, a race of hunting savages in the\r\nearliest, lowest, and most undifferentiated stage, we shall get really\r\nnext to no personal peculiarities or idiosyncrasies of any sort amongst\r\nthem. Every one of them will be a good hunter, a good fisherman, a good\r\nscalper and a good manufacturer of bows and arrows. Division of labour,\r\nand the other troublesome technicalities of our modern political\r\neconomy, are as unknown among such folk as the modern nuisance of\r\ndressing for dinner. Each man performs all the functions of a citizen on\r\nhis own account, because there is nobody else to perform them for\r\nhim--the medium of exchange known as hard cash has not, so far as he is\r\nconcerned, yet been invented; and he performs them well, such as they\r\nare, because he inherits from all his ancestors aptitudes of brain and\r\nmuscle in these directions, owing to the simple fact that those among\r\nhis collateral predecessors who didn't know how to snare a bird, or were\r\nhopelessly stupid in the art of chipping flint arrowheads, died out of\r\nstarvation, leaving no representatives. The beneficent institution of\r\nthe poor law does not exist among savages, in order to enable the\r\nhelpless and incompetent to bring up families in their own image. There,\r\nsurvival of the fittest still works out its own ultimately benevolent\r\nand useful end in its own directly cruel and relentless way, cutting\r\noff ruthlessly the stupid or the weak, and allowing only the strong and\r\nthe cunning to become the parents of future generations.\r\n\r\nHence every young savage, being descended on both sides from ancestors\r\nwho in their own way perfectly fulfilled the ideal of complete\r\nsavagery--were good hunters, good fishers, good fighters, good craftsmen\r\nof bow or boomerang--inherits from these his successful predecessors all\r\nthose qualities of eye and hand and brain and nervous system which go to\r\nmake up the abstractly Admirable Crichton of a savage. The qualities in\r\nquestion are ensured in him by two separate means. In the first place,\r\nsurvival of the fittest takes care that he and all his ancestors shall\r\nhave duly possessed them to some extent to start with; in the second\r\nplace, constant practice from boyhood upward increases and develops the\r\noriginal faculty. Thus savages, as a rule, display absolutely\r\nastonishing ability and cleverness in the few lines which they have made\r\ntheir own. Their cunning in hunting, their patience in fishing, their\r\nskill in trapping, their infinite dodges for deceiving and cajoling the\r\nanimals or enemies that they need to outwit, have moved the wonder and\r\nadmiration of innumerable travellers. The savage, in fact, is not\r\nstupid: in his own way his cleverness is extraordinary. But the way is a\r\nvery narrow and restricted one, and all savages of the same race walk in\r\nit exactly alike. Cunning they have, skill they have, instinct they\r\nhave, to a most marvellous degree; but of spontaneity, originality,\r\ninitiative, variability, not a single spark. Know one savage of a tribe\r\nand you know them all. Their cleverness is not the cleverness of the\r\nindividual man: it is the inherited and garnered intelligence or\r\ninstinct of the entire race.\r\n\r\nHow, then, do originality, diversity, individuality, genius, begin to\r\ncome in? In this way, as it seems to me, looking at the matter both _à\r\npriori_ and by the light of actual experience.\r\n\r\nSuppose a country inhabited in its interior by a savage race of hunters\r\nand fighters, and on its seaboard by an equally savage race of pirates\r\nand fishermen, like the Dyaks of Borneo. Each of these races, if left to\r\nitself, will develop in time its own peculiar and special type of savage\r\ncleverness. Each (in the scientific slang of the day) will adapt itself\r\nto its particular environment. The people of the interior will acquire\r\nand inherit a wonderful facility in spearing monkeys and knocking down\r\nparrots; while the people of the sea-coast will become skilful managers\r\nof canoes upon the water, and merciless plunderers of one another's\r\nvillages, after the universal fashion of all pirates. These original\r\ndifferences of position and function will necessarily entail a thousand\r\nminor differences of intelligence and skill in a thousand different\r\nways. For example, the sea-coast people, having of pure need to make\r\nthemselves canoes and paddles, will probably learn to decorate their\r\nhandicraft with ornamental patterns; and the æsthetic taste thus aroused\r\nwill, no doubt, finally lead them to adorn the façades of their wooden\r\nhuts with the grinning skulls of slaughtered enemies, prettily disposed\r\nat measured distances. A thoughtless world may laugh, indeed, at these\r\nnaïve expressions of the nascent artistic and decorative faculties in\r\nthe savage breast, but the æsthetic philosopher knows how to appreciate\r\nthem at their true worth, and to see in them the earliest ingenuous\r\nprecursors of our own Salisbury, Lichfield, and Westminster.\r\n\r\nNow, so long as these two imaginary races of ours continue to remain\r\ndistinct and separate, it is not likely that idiosyncrasies or varieties\r\nto any great extent will arise among them. But, as soon as you permit\r\nintermarriage to take place, the inherited and developed qualities of\r\nthe one race will be liable to crop up in the next generation, diversely\r\nintermixed in every variety of degree with the inherited and developed\r\nqualities of the other. The children may take after either parent in any\r\ncombination of qualities whatsoever. You have admitted an apparently\r\ncapricious element of individuality: a power on the part of the\r\nhalf-breeds of differing from one another to an extent quite impossible\r\nin the two original homogeneous societies. In one word, you have made\r\npossible the future existence of diversity in character.\r\n\r\nIf, now, we turn from these perfectly simple savage communities to our\r\nown very complex and heterogeneous world, what do we find? An endless\r\nvariety of soldiers, sailors, tinkers, tailors, butchers, bakers,\r\ncandlestick makers, and jolly undertakers, most of whom fall into a\r\ncertain rough number of classes, each with its own developed and\r\ninherited traits and peculiarities. Our world is made up, like the world\r\nof ancient Egypt and of modern India, of an immense variety of separate\r\ncastes--not, indeed, rigidly demarcated and strictly limited as in those\r\nextremely hierarchical societies, but still very fairly hereditary in\r\ncharacter, and given on the average to a tolerably close system of\r\nintermarriage within the caste.\r\n\r\nFor example, there is the agricultural labourer caste--the Hodge\r\nChawbacon of urban humour, who in his military avatar also reappears as\r\nTommy Atkins, a little transfigured, but at bottom identical--the\r\nalternative aspect of a single undivided central reality. Hodge for the\r\nmost part lives and dies in his ancestral village: marries Mary, the\r\ndaughter of Hodge Secundus of that parish, and begets assorted Hodges\r\nand Marys in vast quantities, all of the same pattern, to replenish the\r\nearth in the next generation. There you have a very well-marked\r\nhereditary caste, little given to intermixture with others, and from\r\nwhose members, however recruited by fresh blood, the object of our\r\nquest, the Divine Genius, is very unlikely to find his point of origin.\r\nThen there is the town artisan caste, sprung originally, indeed, from\r\nthe ranks of the Hodges, but naturally selected out of its most active,\r\nenterprising, and intelligent individuals, and often of many generations\r\nstanding in various forms of handicraft. This is a far higher and more\r\npromising type of humanity, from the judicious intermixture of whose\r\nbest elements we are apt to get our Stephensons, our Arkwrights, our\r\nTelfords, and our Edisons. In a rank of life just above the last, we\r\nfind the fixed and immobile farmer caste, which only rarely blossoms\r\nout, under favourable circumstances on both sides, into a stray Cobbett\r\nor an almost miraculous miller Constable. The shopkeepers are a tribe of\r\nmore varied interests and more diversified lives. An immense variety of\r\nbrain elements are called into play by their diverse functions in\r\ndiverse lines; and when we take them in conjunction with the upper\r\nmercantile grades, which are chiefly composed of their ablest and most\r\nsuccessful members, we get considerable chances of those happy blendings\r\nof individual excellences in their casual marriages which go to make up\r\ntalent, and, in their final outcome, genius. Last of all, in the\r\nprofessional and upper classes there is a freedom and play of faculty\r\neverywhere going on, which in the chances of intermarriage between\r\nlawyer-folk and doctor-folk, scientific people and artistic people,\r\ncounty families and bishops or law lords, and so forth _ad infinitum_,\r\noffers by far the best opportunities of any for the occasional\r\ndevelopment of that rare product of the highest humanity, the genuine\r\ngenius.\r\n\r\nBut in every case it is, I believe, essentially intermixture of\r\nvariously acquired hereditary characteristics that makes the best and\r\ntruest geniuses. Left to itself, each separate line of caste ancestry\r\nwould tend to produce a certain fixed Chinese or Japanese perfection of\r\nhandicraft in a certain definite, restricted direction, but not probably\r\nanything worth calling real genius. For example, a family of artists,\r\nstarting with some sort of manual dexterity in imitating natural forms\r\nand colours with paint and pencil, and strictly intermarrying always\r\nwith other families possessing exactly the same inherited endowments,\r\nwould probably go on getting more and more woodenly accurate in its\r\ndrawing; more and more conventionally correct in its grouping; more and\r\nmore technically perfect in its perspective and light-and-shade, and so\r\nforth, by pure dint of accumulated hereditary experience from generation\r\nto generation. It would pass from the Egyptian to the Chinese style of\r\nart by slow degrees and with infinite gradations. But suppose, instead\r\nof thus rigorously confining itself to its own caste, this family of\r\nhandicraft artists were to intermarry freely with poetical, or\r\nseafaring, or candlestick-making stocks. What would be the consequence?\r\nWhy, such an infiltration of other hereditary characteristics, otherwise\r\nacquired, as might make the young painters of future generations more\r\nwide minded, more diversified, more individualistic, more vivid and\r\nlifelike. Some divine spark of poetical imagination, some tenderness of\r\nsentiment, some play of fancy, unknown perhaps, to the hard, dry,\r\nmatter-of-fact limners of the ancestral school, might thus be introduced\r\ninto the original line of hereditary artists. In this way one can easily\r\nsee how even intermarriage with non-artistic stocks might improve the\r\nbreed of a family of painters. For while each caste, left to itself, is\r\nliable to harden down into a mere technical excellence after its own\r\nkind, a wooden facility for drawing faces, or casting up columns of\r\nfigures, or hacking down enemies, or building steam-engines, a healthy\r\ncross with other castes is liable to bring in all kinds of new and\r\nvaluable qualities, each of which, though acquired perhaps in a totally,\r\ndifferent line of life, is apt to bear a new application in the new\r\ncomplex whereof it now forms a part.\r\n\r\nIn our very varied modern societies, every man and every woman, in the\r\nupper and middle ranks of life at least, has an individuality and an\r\nidiosyncrasy so compounded of endless varying stocks and races. Here is\r\none whose father was an Irishman and his mother a Scotchwoman; here is\r\nanother whose paternal line were country parsons, while his maternal\r\nancestors were city merchants or distinguished soldiers. Take almost\r\nanybody's 'sixteen quarters'--his great-great grandfathers and\r\ngreat-great grandmothers, of whom he has sixteen all told--and what do\r\nyou often find? A peer, a cobbler, a barrister, a common sailor, a Welsh\r\ndoctor, a Dutch merchant, a Huguenot pastor, a cornet of horse, an Irish\r\nheiress, a farmer's daughter, a housemaid, an actress, a Devonshire\r\nbeauty, a rich young lady of sugar-broking extraction, a Lady Carolina,\r\na London lodging-house keeper. This is not by any means an exaggerated\r\ncase; it would be easy, indeed, from one's own knowledge of family\r\nhistories to supply a great many real examples far more startling than\r\nthis partially imaginary one. With such a variety of racial and\r\nprofessional antecedents behind us, what infinite possibilities are\r\nopened before us of children with ability, folly, stupidity, genius?\r\n\r\nInfinite numbers of intermixtures everywhere exist in civilised\r\nsocieties. Most of them are passable; many of them are execrable; a few\r\nof them are admirable; and here and there, one of them consists of that\r\nhappy blending of individual characteristics which we all immediately\r\nrecognise as genius--at least after somebody else has told us so.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate recipe for genius, then, would appear to be somewhat after\r\nthis fashion. Take a number of good, strong, powerful stocks, mentally\r\nor physically, endowed with something more than the average amount of\r\nenergy and application. Let them be as varied as possible in\r\ncharacteristics; and, so far as convenient, try to include among them a\r\nconsiderable small-change of races, dispositions, professions, and\r\ntemperaments. Mix, by marriage, to the proper consistency; educate the\r\noffspring, especially by circumstances and environment, as broadly,\r\nfreely, and diversely as you can; let them all intermarry again with\r\nother similarly produced, but personally unlike, idiosyncrasies; and\r\nwatch the result to find your genius in the fourth or fifth generation.\r\nIf the experiment has been properly performed, and all the conditions\r\nhave been decently favourable, you will get among the resultant five\r\nhundred persons a considerable sprinkling of average fools, a fair\r\nproportion of modest mediocrities, a small number of able people, and\r\n(in case you are exceptionally lucky and have shuffled your cards very\r\ncarefully) perhaps among them all a single genius. But most probably the\r\ngenius will have died young of scarlet fever, or missed fire through\r\nsome tiny defect of internal brain structure. Nature herself is trying\r\nthis experiment unaided every day all around us, and, though she makes a\r\ngreat many misses, occasionally she makes a stray hit and then we get a\r\nShakespeare or a Grimaldi.\r\n\r\n'But you haven't proved all this: you have only suggested it.' Does one\r\nprove a thesis of deep-reaching importance in a ten-page essay? And if\r\none proved it in a big book, with classified examples and detailed\r\ngenealogies of all the geniuses, would anybody on earth except Mr.\r\nFrancis Galton ever take the trouble to read it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDESERT SANDS\r\n\r\n\r\nIf deserts _have_ a fault (which their present biographer is far from\r\nadmitting), that fault may doubtless be found in the fact that their\r\nscenery as a rule tends to be just a trifle monotonous. Though fine in\r\nthemselves, they lack variety. To be sure, very few of the deserts of\r\nreal life possess that absolute flatness, sandiness and sameness, which\r\ncharacterises the familiar desert of the poet and of the annual\r\nexhibitions--a desert all level yellow expanse, most bilious in its\r\ncolouring, and relieved by but four allowable academy properties, a\r\npalm-tree, a camel, a sphinx, and a pyramid. For foreground, throw in a\r\nsheikh in appropriate drapery; for background, a sky-line and a\r\nbleaching skeleton; stir and mix, and your picture is finished. Most\r\npractical deserts one comes across in travelling, however, are a great\r\ndeal less simple and theatrical than that; rock preponderates over sand\r\nin their composition, and inequalities of surface are often the rule\r\nrather than the exception. There is reason to believe, indeed, that the\r\nartistic conception of the common or Burlington House desert has been\r\nunduly influenced for evil by the accessibility and the poetic adjuncts\r\nof the Egyptian sand-waste, which, being situated in a great alluvial\r\nriver valley is really flat, and, being the most familiar, has therefore\r\ndistorted to its own shape the mental picture of all its kind elsewhere.\r\nBut most deserts of actual nature are not all flat, nor all sandy; they\r\npresent a considerable diversity and variety of surface, and their rocks\r\nare often unpleasantly obtrusive to the tender feet of the pedestrian\r\ntraveller.\r\n\r\nA desert, in fact, is only a place where the weather is always and\r\nuniformly fine. The sand is there merely as what the logicians call, in\r\ntheir cheerful way, 'a separable accident'; the essential of a desert,\r\nas such, is the absence of vegetation, due to drought. The barometer in\r\nthose happy, too happy, regions, always stands at Set Fair. At least, it\r\nwould, if barometers commonly grew in the desert, where, however, in the\r\npresent condition of science, they are rarely found. It is this dryness\r\nof the air, and this alone, that makes a desert; all the rest, like the\r\ncamels, the sphinx, the skeleton, and the pyramid, is only thrown in to\r\ncomplete the picture.\r\n\r\nNow the first question that occurs to the inquiring mind--which is but a\r\ngraceful periphrasis for the present writer--when it comes to examine in\r\ndetail the peculiarities of deserts is just this: Why are there places\r\non the earth's surface on which rain never falls? What makes it so\r\nuncommonly dry in Sahara when it's so unpleasantly wet and so\r\nunnecessarily foggy in this realm of England? And the obvious answer is,\r\nof course, that deserts exist only in those parts of the world where the\r\nrun of mountain ranges, prevalent winds, and ocean currents conspire to\r\nrender the average rainfall as small as possible. But, strangely enough,\r\nthere is a large irregular belt of the great eastern continent where\r\nthese peculiar conditions occur in an almost unbroken line for thousands\r\nof miles together, from the west coast of Africa to the borders of\r\nChina: and it is in this belt that all the best known deserts of the\r\nworld are actually situated. In one place it is the Atlas and the Kong\r\nmountains (now don't pretend, as David Copperfield's aunt would have\r\nsaid, you don't know the Kong mountains); at another place it is the\r\nArabian coast range, Lebanon, and the Beluchi hills; at a third, it is\r\nthe Himalayas and the Chinese heights that intercept and precipitate all\r\nthe moisture from the clouds. But, from whatever variety of local causes\r\nit may arise, the fact still remains the same, that all the great\r\ndeserts run in this long, almost unbroken series, beginning with the\r\ngreater and the smaller Sahara, continuing in the Libyan and Egyptian\r\ndesert, spreading on through the larger part of Arabia, reappearing to\r\nthe north as the Syrian desert, and to the east as the desert of\r\nRajputana (the Great Indian Desert of the Anglo-Indian mind), while\r\nfurther east again the long line terminates in the desert of Gobi on the\r\nChinese frontier.\r\n\r\nIn other parts of the world, deserts are less frequent. The peculiar\r\ncombination of circumstances which goes to produce them does not\r\nelsewhere occur over any vast area, on so large a scale. Still, there is\r\none region in western America where the necessary conditions are found\r\nto perfection. The high snow-clad peaks of the Rocky Mountains on the\r\none side check and condense all the moisture that comes from the\r\nAtlantic; the Sierra Nevada and the Wahsatch range on the other, running\r\nparallel with them to the west, check and condense all the moisture that\r\ncomes from the Pacific coast. In between these two great lines lies the\r\ndry and almost rainless district known to the ambitious western mind as\r\nthe Great American Desert, enclosing in its midst that slowly\r\nevaporating inland sea, the Great Salt Lake, a last relic of some\r\nextinct chain of mighty waters once comparable to Superior, Erie, and\r\nOntario. In Mexico, again, where the twin ranges draw closer together,\r\ndesert conditions once more supervene. But it is in central Australia\r\nthat the causes which lead to the desert state are, perhaps on the\r\nwhole, best exemplified. There, ranges of high mountains extend almost\r\nall round the coasts, and so completely intercept the rainfall which\r\nought to fertilise the great central plain that the rivers are almost\r\nall short and local, and one thirsty waste spreads for miles and miles\r\ntogether over the whole unexplored interior of the continent.\r\n\r\nBut why are deserts rocky and sandy? Why aren't they covered, like the\r\nrest of the world, with earth, soil, mould, or dust? One can see plainly\r\nenough why there should be little or no vegetation where no rain falls,\r\nbut one can't see quite so easily why there should be only sand and rock\r\ninstead of arid clay-field.\r\n\r\nWell, the answer is that without vegetation there is no such thing as\r\nsoil on earth anywhere. The top layer of the land in all ordinary and\r\nwell-behaved countries is composed entirely of vegetable mould, the\r\ndecaying remains of innumerable generations of weeds and grasses. Earth\r\nto earth is the rule of nature. Soil, in fact, consists entirely of dead\r\nleaves. And where there are no leaves to die and decay, there can be no\r\nmould or soil to speak of. Darwin showed, indeed, in his last great\r\nbook, that we owe the whole earthy covering of our hills and plains\r\nalmost entirely to the perennial exertions of that friend of the\r\nfarmers, the harmless, necessary earthworm. Year after year the silent\r\nworker is busy every night pulling down leaves through his tunnelled\r\nburrow into his underground nest, and there converting them by means of\r\nhis castings into the black mould which produces, in the end, for lordly\r\nman, all his cultivable fields and pasture-lands and meadows. Where\r\nthere are no leaves and no earth-worms, therefore, there can be no soil;\r\nand under those circumstances we get what we familiarly know as a\r\ndesert.\r\n\r\nThe normal course of events where new land rises above the sea is\r\nsomething like this, as oceanic isles have sufficiently demonstrated.\r\nThe rock when it first emerges from the water rises bare and rugged like\r\na sea-cliff; no living thing, animal or vegetable, is harboured anywhere\r\non its naked surface. In time, however, as rain falls upon its jutting\r\npeaks and barren pinnacles, disintegration sets in, or, to speak plainer\r\nEnglish, the rock crumbles; and soon streams wash down tiny deposits of\r\nsand and mud thus produced into the valleys and hollows of the upheaved\r\narea. At the same time lichens begin to spring in yellow patches upon\r\nthe bare face of the rock, and feathery ferns, whose spores have been\r\nwafted by the wind, or carried by the waves, or borne on the feet of\r\nunconscious birds, sprout here and there from the clefts and crannies.\r\nThese, as they die and decay, in turn form a thin layer of vegetable\r\nmould, the first beginning of a local soil, in which the trusty\r\nearthworm (imported in the egg on driftwood or floating weeds)\r\nstraightway sets to work to burrow, and which he rapidly increases by\r\nhis constant labour. On the soil thus deposited, flowering plants and\r\ntrees can soon root themselves, as fast as seeds, nuts or fruits are\r\nwafted to the island by various accidents from surrounding countries.\r\nThe new land thrown up by the great eruption of Krakatoa has in this way\r\nalready clothed itself from head to foot with a luxuriant sheet of\r\nferns, mosses, and other vegetation.\r\n\r\nFirst soil, then plant and animal life, are thus in the last resort\r\nwholly dependent for their existence on the amount of rainfall. But in\r\ndeserts, where rain seldom or never falls (except by accident) the first\r\nterm in this series is altogether wanting. There can be no rivers,\r\nbrooks or streams to wash down beds of alluvial deposit from the\r\nmountains to the valleys. Denudation (the term, though rather awful, is\r\nnot an improper one) must therefore take a different turn. Practically\r\nspeaking, there is no water action; the work is all done by sun and\r\nwind. Under these circumstances, the rocks crumble away very slowly by\r\nmere exposure into small fragments, which the wind knocks off and blows\r\nabout the surface, forming sand or dust of them in all convenient\r\nhollows. The frequent currents, produced by the heated air that lies\r\nupon the basking layer of sand, continually keep the surface agitated,\r\nand so blow about the sand and grind one piece against the other till it\r\nbecomes ever finer and finer. Thus for the most part the hollows or\r\nvalleys of deserts are filled by plains of bare sand, while their higher\r\nportions consist rather of barren, rocky mountains or table-land.\r\n\r\nThe effect upon whatever animal or vegetable life can manage here and\r\nthere to survive under such circumstances is very peculiar. Deserts are\r\nthe most exacting of all known environments, and they compel their\r\ninhabitants with profound imperiousness to knuckle under to their\r\nprejudices and preconceptions in ten thousand particulars.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, all the smaller denizens of the desert--whether\r\nbutterflies, beetles, birds, or lizards--must be quite uniformly\r\nisabelline or sand-coloured. This universal determination of the\r\ndesert-haunting creatures to fall in with the fashion and to harmonise\r\nwith their surroundings adds considerably to the painfully monotonous\r\neffect of desert scenery. A green plant, a blue butterfly, a red and\r\nyellow bird, a black or bronze-coloured beetle or lizard would improve\r\nthe artistic aspect of the desert not a little. But no; the animals will\r\nhear nothing of such gaudy hues; with Quaker uniformity they will clothe\r\nthemselves in dove-colour; they will all wear a sandy pepper-and-salt\r\nwith as great unanimity as the ladies of the Court (on receipt of\r\norders) wear Court mourning for the late lamented King of the Tongataboo\r\nIslands.\r\n\r\nIn reality, this universal sombre tint of desert animals is a beautiful\r\nexample of the imperious working of our modern _Deus ex machinâ_,\r\nnatural selection. The more uniform in hue is the environment of any\r\nparticular region, the more uniform in hue must be all its inhabitants.\r\nIn the arctic snows, for example, we find this principle pushed to its\r\nfurthest logical conclusion. There, everything is and must be\r\nwhite--hares, foxes, and ptarmigans alike; and the reason is\r\nobvious--there can be no exception. Any brown or black or reddish animal\r\nwho ventured north would at once render himself unpleasantly conspicuous\r\nin the midst of the uniform arctic whiteness. If he were a brown hare,\r\nfor example, the foxes and bears and birds of prey of the district would\r\nspot him at once on the white fields, and pounce down upon him forthwith\r\non his first appearance. That hare would leave no similar descendants to\r\ncontinue the race of brown hares in arctic regions after him. Or,\r\nsuppose, on the other hand, it were a brown fox who invaded the domain\r\nof eternal snow. All the hares and ptarmigans of his new district would\r\nbehold him coming from afar and keep well out of his way, while he, poor\r\ncreature, would never be able to spot them at all among the white\r\nsnow-fields. He would starve for want of prey, at the very time when the\r\nwhite fox, his neighbour, was stealing unperceived with stealthy tread\r\nupon the hares and ptarmigans. In this way, from generation to\r\ngeneration of arctic animals, the blacker or browner have been\r\nconstantly weeded out, and the greyer and whiter have been constantly\r\nencouraged, till now all arctic animals alike are as spotlessly snowy as\r\nthe snow around them.\r\n\r\nIn the desert much the same causes operate, in a slightly different way,\r\nin favour of a general greyness or brownness as against pronounced\r\nshades of black, white, red, green, or yellow. Desert animals, like\r\nintense South Kensington, go in only for neutral tints. In proportion as\r\neach individual approaches in hue to the sand about it will it succeed\r\nin life in avoiding its enemies or in creeping upon its prey, according\r\nto circumstances. In proportion as it presents a strikingly vivid or\r\ndistinct appearance among the surrounding sand will it make itself a\r\nsure mark for its watchful foes, if it happen to be an unprotected\r\nskulker, or will it be seen beforehand and avoided by its prey, if it\r\nhappen to be a predatory hunting or insect-eating beast. Hence on the\r\nsandy desert all species alike are uniformly sand-coloured. Spotty\r\nlizards bask on spotty sands, keeping a sharp look-out for spotty\r\nbutterflies and spotty beetles, only to be themselves spotted and\r\ndevoured in turn by equally spotty birds, or snakes, or tortoises. All\r\nnature seems to have gone into half-mourning together, or, converted by\r\na passing Puritan missionary, to have clad itself incontinently in grey\r\nand fawn-colour.\r\n\r\nEven the larger beasts that haunt the desert take their tone not a\r\nlittle from their sandy surroundings. You have only to compare the\r\ndesert-haunting lion with the other great cats to see at once the reason\r\nfor his peculiar uniform. The tigers and other tropical jungle-cats have\r\ntheir coats arranged in vertical stripes of black and yellow, which,\r\nthough you would hardly believe it unless you saw them in their native\r\nnullahs (good word 'nullah,' gives a convincing Indian tone to a\r\nnarrative of adventure), harmonise marvellously with the lights and\r\nshades of the bamboos and cane-brakes through whose depths the tiger\r\nmoves so noiselessly.\r\n\r\nLooking into the gloom of a tangled jungle, it is almost impossible to\r\npick out the beast from the yellow stems and dark shadows in which it\r\nhides, save by the baleful gleam of those wicked eyes, catching the\r\nlight for one second as they turn wistfully and bloodthirstily towards\r\nthe approaching stranger. The jaguar, oncelot, leopard, and other\r\ntree-cats, on the other hand, are dappled or spotted--a type of\r\ncoloration which exactly harmonises with the light and shade of the\r\nround sun-spots seen through the foliage of a tropical forest. They,\r\ntoo, are almost indistinguishable from the trees overhead as they creep\r\nalong cautiously on the trunks and branches. But spots or stripes would\r\nat once betray the crouching lion among the bare rocks or desert sands;\r\nand therefore the lion is approximately sand-coloured. Seen in a cage at\r\nthe Zoo, the British lion is a very conspicuous animal indeed; but\r\nspread at full length on a sandy patch or among bare yellow rocks under\r\nthe Saharan sun, you may walk into his mouth before you are even aware\r\nof his august existence.\r\n\r\nThe three other great desert beasts of Asia or Africa--the ostrich, the\r\ngiraffe, and the camel--are less protectively coloured, for various\r\nreasons. Giraffes and ostriches go in herds; they trust for safety\r\nmainly to their swiftness of foot, and, when driven to bay, like most\r\ngregarious animals, they make common cause against the ill-advised\r\nintruder. In such cases it is often well, for the sake of stragglers,\r\nthat the herd should be readily distinguished at a distance; and it is\r\nto insure this advantage, I believe, that giraffes have acquired their\r\nstrongly marked spots, as zebras have acquired their distinctive\r\nstripes, and hyænas their similarly banded or dappled coats. One must\r\nalways remember that disguise may be carried a trifle too far, and that\r\nrecognisability in the parents often gives the young and giddy a point\r\nin their favour. For example, it seems certain that the general\r\ngrey-brown tint of European rabbits serves to render them\r\nindistinguishable in a field of bracken, stubble, or dry grass. How hard\r\nit is, either for man or hawk, to pick out rabbits so long as they sit\r\nstill, in an English meadow! But as soon as they begin to run towards\r\ntheir burrows the white patch by their tails inevitably betrays them;\r\nand this betrayal seems at first sight like a failure of adaptation.\r\nCertainly many a rabbit must be spotted and shot, or killed by birds of\r\nprey, solely on account of that tell-tale white patch as he makes for\r\nhis shelter. Nevertheless, when we come to look closer, we can see, as\r\nMr. Wallace acutely suggests, that the tell-tale patch has its function\r\nalso. On the first alarm the parent rabbits take to their heels at once,\r\nand run at any untoward sight or sound toward the safety of the burrow.\r\nThe white patch and the hoisted tail act as a danger-signal to the\r\nlittle bunnies, and direct them which way to escape the threatened\r\nmisfortune. The young ones take the hint at once and follow their\r\nleader. Thus what may be sometimes a disadvantage to the individual\r\nanimal becomes in the long run of incalculable benefit to the entire\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note, too, how much alike in build and gait are\r\nthese three thoroughbred desert roamers, the giraffe, the ostrich, and\r\nthe camel or dromedary. In their long legs, their stalking march, their\r\ntall necks, and their ungainly appearance they all betoken their common\r\nadaptation to the needs and demands of a special environment. Since food\r\nis scarce and shelter rare, they have to run about much over large\r\nspaces in search of a livelihood or to escape their enemies. Then the\r\nburning nature of the sand as well as the need for speed compels them to\r\nhave long legs which in turn necessitate equally long necks, if they are\r\nto reach the ground or the trees overhead for food and drink. Their feet\r\nhave to be soft and padded to enable them to run over the sand with\r\nease; and hard horny patches must protect their knees and all other\r\nportions of the body liable to touch the sweltering surface when they\r\nlie down to rest themselves. Finally, they can all endure thirst for\r\nlong periods together; and the camel, the most inveterate\r\ndesert-haunter of the trio, is even provided with a special stomach to\r\ntake in water for several days at a stretch, besides having a peculiarly\r\ntough skin in which perspiration is reduced to a minimum. He carries his\r\nown water-supply internally, and wastes as little of it by the way as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nWhat the camel is among animals that is the cactus among plants--the\r\nmost confirmed and specialised of desert-haunting organisms. It has been\r\nwholly developed in, by, and for the desert. I don't mean merely to say\r\nthat cactuses resemble camels because they are clumsy, ungainly,\r\nawkward, and paradoxical; that would be a point of view almost as far\r\nbeneath the dignity of science (which in spite of occasional lapses into\r\nthe sin of levity I endeavour as a rule piously to uphold) as the old\r\nand fallacious reason 'because there's a B in both.' But cactuses, like\r\ncamels, take in their water supply whenever they can get it, and never\r\nwaste any of it on the way by needless evaporation. As they form the\r\nperfect central type of desert vegetation, and are also familiar plants\r\nto everyone, they may be taken as a good illustrative example of the\r\neffect that desert conditions inevitably produce upon vegetable\r\nevolution.\r\n\r\nQuaint, shapeless, succulent, jointed, the cactuses look at first sight\r\nas if they were all leaves, and had no stem or trunk worth mentioning.\r\nOf course, therefore, the exact opposite is really the case; for, as a\r\nlate lamented poet has assured us in mournful numbers, things (generally\r\nspeaking) are not what they seem. The true truth about the cactuses runs\r\njust the other way; they are all stem and no leaves; what look like\r\nleaves being really joints of the trunk or branches, and the foliage\r\nbeing all dwarfed and stunted into the prickly hairs that dot and\r\nencumber the surface. All plants of very arid soils--for example, our\r\ncommon English stonecrops--tend to be thick, jointed, and succulent;\r\nthe distinction between stem and leaves tends to disappear; and the\r\nwhole weed, accustomed at times to long drought, acquires the habit of\r\ndrinking in water greedily at its rootlets after every rain, and storing\r\nit away for future use in its thick, sponge-like, and water-tight\r\ntissues. To prevent undue evaporation, the surface also is covered with\r\na thick, shiny skin--a sort of vegetable macintosh, which effectually\r\nchecks all unnecessary transpiration. Of this desert type, then, the\r\ncactus is the furthest possible term. It has no flat leaves with\r\nexpanded blades, to wither and die in the scorching desert air; but in\r\ntheir stead the thick and jointed stems do the same work--absorb carbon\r\nfrom the carbonic acid of the air, and store up water in the driest of\r\nseasons. Then, to repel the attacks of herbivores, who would gladly get\r\nat the juicy morsel if they could, the foliage has been turned into\r\nsharp defensive spines and prickles. The cactus is tenacious of life to\r\na wonderful degree; and for reproduction it trusts not merely to its\r\nbrilliant flowers, fertilised for the most part by desert moths or\r\nbutterflies, and to its juicy fruit, of which the common prickly pear is\r\na familiar instance, but it has the special property of springing afresh\r\nfrom any stray bit or fragment of the stem that happens to fall upon the\r\ndry ground anywhere.\r\n\r\nTrue cactuses (in the native state) are confined to America; but the\r\nunhappy naturalist who ventures to say so in mixed society is sure to\r\nget sat upon (without due cause) by numberless people who have seen 'the\r\ncactus' wild all the world over. For one thing, the prickly pear and a\r\nfew other common American species, have been naturalised and run wild\r\nthroughout North Africa, the Mediterranean shores, and a great part of\r\nIndia, Arabia, and Persia. But what is more interesting and more\r\nconfusing still, other desert plants which are _not_ cactuses, living\r\nin South Africa, Sind, Rajputana, and elsewhere unspecified, have been\r\ndriven by the nature of their circumstances and the dryness of the soil\r\nto adopt precisely the same tactics, and therefore unconsciously to\r\nmimic or imitate the cactus tribe in the minutest details of their\r\npersonal appearance. Most of these fallacious pseudo-cactuses are really\r\nspurges or euphorbias by family. They resemble the true Mexican type in\r\nexternals only; that is to say, their stems are thick, jointed, and\r\nleaf-like, and they grow with clumsy and awkward angularity; but in the\r\nflower, fruit, seed, and in short in all structural peculiarities\r\nwhatsoever, they differ utterly from the genuine cactus, and closely\r\nresemble all their spurge relations. Adaptive likenesses of this sort,\r\ndue to mere stress of local conditions, have no more weight as\r\nindications of real relationship than the wings of the bat or the\r\nnippers of the seal, which don't make the one into a skylark, or the\r\nother into a mackerel.\r\n\r\nIn Sahara, on the other hand, the prevailing type of vegetation\r\n(wherever there is any) belongs to the kind playfully described by Sir\r\nLambert Playfair as 'salsolaceous,' that is to say, in plainer English,\r\nit consists of plants like the glass-wort and the kali-weed, which are\r\ncommonly burnt to make soda. These fleshy weeds resemble the cactuses in\r\nbeing succulent and thick-skinned but they differ from them in their\r\ncurious ability to live upon very salt and soda-laden water. All through\r\nthe great African desert region, in fact, most of the water is more or\r\nless brackish; 'bitter lakes' are common, and gypsum often covers the\r\nground over immense areas. These districts occupy the beds of vast\r\nancient lakes, now almost dry, of which the existing _chotts_, or very\r\nsalt pools, are the last shrunken and evanescent relics.\r\n\r\nAnd this point about the water brings me at last to a cardinal fact in\r\nthe constitution of deserts which is almost always utterly misconceived\r\nin Europe. Most people at home picture the desert to themselves as\r\nwholly dead, flat, and sandy. To talk about the fauna and flora of\r\nSahara sounds in their ears like self-contradictory nonsense. But, as a\r\nmatter of fact, that uniform and lifeless desert of the popular fancy\r\nexists only in those sister arts that George II.--good, practical\r\nman--so heartily despised, 'boetry and bainting.' The desert of real\r\nlife, though less impressive, is far more varied. It has its ups and\r\ndowns, its hills and valleys. It has its sandy plains and its rocky\r\nridges. It has its lakes and ponds, and even its rivers. It has its\r\nplants and animals, its oases and palm-groves. In short, like everything\r\nelse on earth, it's a good deal more complex than people imagine.\r\n\r\nOne may take Sahara as a very good example of the actual desert of\r\nphysical geography, in contradistinction to the level and lifeless\r\ndesert that stretches like the sea over illimitable spaces in verse or\r\ncanvas. And here, I fear, I am going to dispel another common and\r\ncherished illusion. It is my fate to be an iconoclast, and perhaps long\r\npractice has made me rather like the trade than otherwise. A popular\r\nbelief exists all over Europe that the late M. Roudaire--that De Lesseps\r\nwho never quite 'came off'--proposed to cut a canal from the\r\nMediterranean into the heart of Africa, which was intended, in the\r\nstereotyped phrase of journalism, to 'flood Sahara,' and convert the\r\ndesert into an inland sea. He might almost as well have talked of\r\ncutting a canal from Brighton to the Devil's Dyke and 'submerging\r\nEngland,' as the devil wished to do in the old legend. As a matter of\r\nfact, good, practical M. Roudaire, sound engineer that he was, never\r\neven dreamt of anything so chimerical. What he did really propose was\r\nsomething far milder and simpler in its way, but, as his scheme has\r\ngiven rise to the absurd notion that Sahara as a whole lies below\r\nsea-level, it may be worth while briefly to explain what it was he\r\nreally thought of doing.\r\n\r\nSome sixty miles south of Biskra, the most fashionable resort in the\r\nAlgerian Sahara, there is a deep depression two hundred and fifty miles\r\nlong, partly occupied by three salt lakes of the kind so common over the\r\nwhole dried-up Saharan area. These three lakes, shrunken remnants of\r\nmuch larger sheets, lie below the level of the Mediterranean, but they\r\nare separated from it, and from one another, by upland ranges which rise\r\nconsiderably above the sea line. What M. Roudaire proposed to do was to\r\ncut canals through these three barriers, and flood the basins of the\r\nsalt lakes. The result would have been, not as is commonly said to\r\nsubmerge Sahara, nor even to form anything worth seriously describing as\r\n'an inland sea,' but to substitute three larger salt lakes for the\r\nexisting three smaller ones. The area so flooded, however, would bear to\r\nthe whole area of Sahara something like the same proportion that Windsor\r\nPark bears to the entire surface of England. This is the true truth\r\nabout that stupendous undertaking, which is to create a new\r\nMediterranean in the midst of the Dark Continent, and to modify the\r\nclimate of Northern Europe to something like the condition of the\r\nGlacial Epoch. A new Dead Sea would be much nearer the mark, and the\r\nonly way Northern Europe would feel the change, if it felt it at all,\r\nwould be in a slight fall in the price of dates in the wholesale market.\r\n\r\nNo, Sahara as a whole is _not_ below sea-level; it is _not_ the dry bed\r\nof a recent ocean; and it is _not_ as flat as the proverbial pancake all\r\nover. Part of it, indeed, is very mountainous, and all of it is more or\r\nless varied in level. The Upper Sahara consists of a rocky plateau,\r\nrising at times into considerable peaks; the Lower, to which it\r\ndescends by a steep slope, is 'a vast depression of clay and sand,' but\r\nstill for the most part standing high above sea-level. No portion of the\r\nUpper Sahara is less than 1,300 feet high--a good deal higher than\r\nDartmoor or Derbyshire. Most of the Lower reaches from two to three\r\nhundred feet--quite as elevated as Essex or Leicester. The few spots\r\nbelow sea-level consist of the beds of ancient lakes, now much shrunk by\r\nevaporation, owing to the present rainless condition of the country; the\r\nsoil around these is deep in gypsum, and the water itself is\r\nconsiderably salter than the sea. That, however, is always the case with\r\nfresh-water lakes in their last dotage, as American geologists have amply\r\nproved in the case of the Great Salt Lake of Utah. Moving sand\r\nundoubtedly covers a large space in both divisions of the desert, but\r\naccording to Sir Lambert Playfair, our best modern authority on the\r\nsubject, it occupies not more than one-third part of the entire Algerian\r\nSahara. Elsewhere rock, clay, and muddy lake are the prevailing\r\nfeatures, interspersed with not infrequent date-groves and villages, the\r\nproduct of artesian wells, or excavated spaces, or river oases. Even\r\nSahara, in short, to give it its due, is not by any means so black as\r\nit's painted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINTED BY\r\nSPOTTISWOODE AND CO., NEW-STREET SQUARE\r\nLONDON",
