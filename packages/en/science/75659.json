E. Muriel, of the Imperial Indian Forest Service, gave a\r\nlist of the more common trees and shrubs and of a few other plants,\r\ntogether with short descriptions and statements on their uses and\r\neconomic value, also their Arabic and, where possible, the Hameg names.\r\n\r\nAt the end of that year the Sudan Government gave me the appointment of\r\nDirector of Woods and Forests. At that time only few of the volumes of\r\nthe Flora of Tropical Africa had appeared and the earliest ones were\r\nalready antiquated. During the numerous journeys taken by me in various\r\nparts of the Sudan, my wife and I were able to collect a large number of\r\nplants, making at the same time notes of their names in various\r\nlanguages of the Sudan, and their economic and other uses. I also\r\nreceived considerable help, as regards Golo names, from the late Mr. S.\r\nSkirmunt, then Deputy Inspector of Forests in the Bahr el Ghazal\r\nProvince. By 1906 I had gathered sufficient material both from my trips\r\nand from the Kew Herbarium to draw up a rough “Catalogue of Sudan\r\nFlowering Plants,” giving short descriptions, a number of vernacular\r\nnames and some economic and other uses, many of which were obtained from\r\nWatt’s Dictionary of Economic Products.[1] As it was somewhat hastily\r\ngot up it was printed by the Sudan Government not for general\r\ncirculation, but for the use of Sudan officials only.\r\n\r\nDuring the years which followed, up to my retirement in 1910, I was able\r\nto add to the list a considerable number of names both scientific and\r\nvernacular. I am indebted for the help I received, as regards Kordofan\r\nplants, to Mr. H. B. MacMichael, of the Sudan Civil Service, and, as\r\nregards the Red Sea littoral, to Mr. Cyril Crossland, at that time\r\nMarine Biologist to the Sudan Government.\r\n\r\nAfter my retirement Mr. R. E. Massey was appointed, in 1912, Sudan\r\nGovernment Botanist, and I had the good fortune of securing his co-\r\noperation in bringing out a more complete Catalogue of the Flowering\r\nPlants of the Sudan. Mr. Massey, by his presence on the spot, and by his\r\ntechnical knowledge, has been able to give to the present Catalogue a\r\ngreater completeness and finish than I should have been capable of\r\nunaided; he was also able to get further assistance from other persons\r\nin the Sudan. He particularly and gratefully acknowledges the help he\r\nreceived from Mrs. Crowfoot, wife of Mr. J. W. Crowfoot, Director of\r\nEducation, in a variety of ways, such as collections of plants,\r\nHadendowa and other vernacular names, and drawings and paintings of\r\nplants. A number of Dinka and Shilluk names were also given by Mr. H. C.\r\nJackson, of the Sudan Civil Service, and Nuer names by the late Major\r\nStigand. A collection of plants of the Burun country, with their\r\nvernacular names, was received from Dr. Kamar, of the Egyptian Army, a\r\nfurther collection by Mr. Sillitoe, superintendent of Gardens, Khartoum,\r\nfrom the Lado District, and one from Admiral Lynes, C.B., C.M.G., in\r\nDarfur, mostly in the region of the range of mountains, called Jebel\r\nMarra, which attains an elevation of over 10,000 ft., and bears a flora\r\nquite distinct from all other parts of the Sudan.\r\n\r\nThe Catalogue was at first compiled without any descriptive matter, but\r\nMr. R. Hewison, Director of Agriculture and Forests, Sudan Government,\r\nspeaking on behalf of that Government, which is defraying the costs of\r\nprinting this book, expressed an opinion that it would be more useful to\r\nofficials in the Sudan if short descriptions were added. In order,\r\ntherefore, to supply these as quickly as possible we depended very\r\nlargely on descriptions in the Flora of Tropical Africa, which we\r\nshortened considerably. My wife and I worked this out as far as and\r\nincluding the Cyperaceæ, and Mr. Massey undertook to do the grasses,\r\npart only of which have as yet appeared in the Flora. He desires to\r\nacknowledge the aid received from Mr. C. E. Hubbard in the preparation\r\nof the key to the Grasses. Mr. J. Hutchinson kindly helped us with\r\nplants in the Kew Herbarium which have not been described in the Flora.\r\nBut a further acknowledgment is due to Mr. Hutchinson. He has regrouped\r\nthe Natural Orders according to the system described in his recent book,\r\n_The Families of Flowering Plants, I. Dicotyledons_,[2] and has also\r\nfurnished a key to the Classification, thus bringing this book into line\r\nwith all the African Regional Floras which are to be taken in hand. He\r\nhas also consented to look over the proofs. Our most cordial thanks are\r\ndue for his help.\r\n\r\nMy wife has been constantly associated with me in my share of the work\r\nfrom the time when we collected material in the Sudan until now, and\r\ndeserves also to earn her share of whatever credit may be given for this\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nFinally, I wish to record the debt of gratitude which we owe to Dr.\r\nHill, Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, to Mr. Cotton, the\r\nKeeper of the Herbarium, to Dr. Stapf, the late Keeper, and to the Staff\r\nof the Herbarium, most particularly Mr. C. H. Wright, Mr. Dunn, Miss\r\nHughes, and Mr. Skan for the numerous acts of kindness and help which\r\nthey have given us, making thus our work light and pleasant.\r\n\r\n                                                          A.

Mrs. Crowfoot, to\r\nwhom reference has been made above, is now bringing out a companion\r\nvolume to this, containing drawings of various plants from the Northern\r\nand Central Sudan.\r\n\r\nMy dear wife, who shared all my work, died on the 11th April, 1927.\r\n\r\n                                                          A.

The “Parietales” in this sense are not\r\nthe _Parietales_ of either Bentham & Hooker or of Engler.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: The flowers of this family (which consist of 5 usually free\r\nsepals, a 5-lobed corolla, 5 stamens and a pistil of 2 carpels) are\r\npeculiar (i) by the _coronal_ lobes, either free or connate, simple or\r\ndouble at or inside the mouth of the tube of the corolla; (ii) by the\r\nstamens which, although exceptionally free at the base, are usually\r\nconnate by the filaments; these, with the anthers and their appendages\r\nforming the _staminal column_, but the anthers being free or united to\r\nthe dilated part of the style; the anthers are 2, dehiscing by terminal\r\nor lateral slits and are continued on the margins or below the pollen\r\ncells by wing-like processes (_anther-wings_); the connectives of the\r\nanthers are often produced into membranous (rarely fleshy or inflated)\r\nterminal, sometimes connate appendages, or apiculate, or unappendaged;\r\n(iii) by the pollen which is either granular or more commonly united\r\ninto 1 or 2 clavate, waxy masses or _pollinia_; (iv) by the pistil\r\nwhich, although consisting of 2 carpels, is united above into a dilated\r\npentagonal disk; (v) by the fruit consisting of 2 follicles or by\r\nabortion one only, the seeds being usually numerous, imbricate, somewhat\r\nlike fish scales, generally crowned with a tuft of long silky hairs.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Herbs; stems cylindrical or trigonous, solid. Leaves grass-\r\nlike, tough, but sheaths (except in _Eriospora Schweinfurthiana_) not\r\nslit down one side. Infl. umbellate, capitate or panicled, made up of\r\nspikes bearing spikelets composed of an axis (_rhachilla_) and of empty\r\nor flower-bearing bracts (_glumes_). Fl. minute, 1 or 2-sexual, in axils\r\nof glumes. Per. 0, or consisting of 2-6 hypogynous scales or bristles;\r\nsta. 1-3, anthers basifixed; style 2-3 branched, or subentire, base\r\noften thickened; fruit a compressed or 3-gonous nut.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Differs from _Cyperus_ by never being leafless, by\r\ndisarticulation of (always winged) rhachilla in one piece above the two\r\nlowest empty glumes, and by the spikelets which, in Cyperus never less\r\nthan 5 fld., may here be as little as 1 fld. (although at times up to 20\r\nfld.).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's note:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Several of the Keys to the families (starting pg. 16) have had their\r\n  key steps marked with letters, in the style of the Key to the genera\r\n  of Grasses (pg. 430).\r\n\r\n  pg 1 Changed: male organs of a flowers to: flower\r\n\r\n  pg 5 Changed: =Gnetaceæ= and =Cyacadaceæ= to: =Cycadaceæ=\r\n\r\n  pg 5 Changed: glass-like, transparent or trunslucent to: translucent\r\n\r\n  pg 10 Changed: bundles by junction of filamens to: filaments\r\n\r\n  pg 11 Changed: generally separate at muturity to: maturity\r\n\r\n  pg 12 From: stamen, the ovone male organ of the flower.\r\n  removed: ovone\r\n\r\n  pg 35 Changed: Ovules 1-2 in each cell; corolla lobes inbricate to:\r\n  imbricate\r\n\r\n  pg 45 Changed: march or aquatic herbs to: marsh\r\n\r\n  pg 46 Changed: =Pontederiacæ= (part) to: =Pontederiaceæ=\r\n\r\n  pg 47 Changed: =Zinziberaceæ= to: =Zingiberaceæ=\r\n\r\n  pg 54 Changed: maroon-coloured, unilateral, legulate to: ligulate\r\n\r\n  pg 56 Changed: Borber Desert to: Berber\r\n\r\n  pg 63 Changed: BUN—Borun to: Burun\r\n\r\n  pg 63 Changed: hairs shellate.
