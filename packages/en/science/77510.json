  "content": "The Assistant Self\r\n\r\nby F. L. Wallace\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Sympathy for others may be one of the seven cardinal virtues. But\r\n  man does not live by virtue alone, and a superabundance of any one\r\n  attribute--however admirable in itself--can lead to stark tragedy.\r\n  To appreciate fully the breadth of that tragedy you must follow in\r\n  the footsteps of F. L. Wallace as he scatters golden nuggets of\r\n  science fantasy entertainment along the frontiers of tomorrow with a\r\n  prodigality undreamed of by lesser scribes. Here is a yarn that takes\r\n  you straight into realms of abiding mystery and surmise_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  =It was a world of Utopian dreams and industrial strife--buffeted by\r\n  the winds of human unreason. But Hal Talbot was a man apart.=\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“You always see the other person’s side,” said Laura. “Even the boss’s,\r\nespecially when he fires you.”\r\n\r\nShe swept the compact into her purse and stood up. “Now see if you can\r\nunderstand _my_ point of view.” With a withering contempt in her eyes\r\nshe swung the purse to her shoulder and walked rapidly away.\r\n\r\nHal Talbot stared morosely at his drink. The worst of it was--he knew\r\nexactly how she felt. In spite of what everyone professed to believe\r\nempathy was a dreadful handicap. He had more than his share of it, and\r\nhe couldn’t even hold down a simple lousy job.\r\n\r\nHe raised the glass and saw through it a man--a total\r\nstranger--standing beside the booth in amused expectation. _The hell\r\nwith him_, Talbot thought. He drank the beer and set the glass down.\r\n\r\n“Do you mind if I sit here?” the stranger asked.\r\n\r\nTalbot looked him over carefully. He was well-dressed--too\r\nwell-dressed--and he conformed in virtually every other respect to the\r\npopular conception of the executive, suave and so completely sure of\r\nhimself. Therefore--he probably wasn’t.\r\n\r\n“Suit yourself,” grunted Talbot.\r\n\r\nThe man sat down and ordered for both of them. It was all right with\r\nTalbot. He _could_ have paid for the drinks, but he was keenly aware\r\nthat his dwindling resources wouldn’t last long.\r\n\r\n“I couldn’t help overhearing the conversation,” said the man.\r\n\r\n“We have all our fights in public,” said Talbot, with embittered irony.\r\n“It makes things more final.”\r\n\r\nThe stranger stared at him steadily for an instant, his brows\r\ncontracted. Then he asked: “Are you sure this is final?”\r\n\r\n“You heard what she said. I can’t hold a job.”\r\n\r\n“That’s precisely what I mean. You seem capable enough. I’m curious as\r\nto the reason.”\r\n\r\nTalbot looked at the other more intently. He was a man of much the same\r\ngeneral build as Talbot, but he appeared to be five or six years older.\r\n\r\n“I mean no offense,” said the man. He fumbled in his pocket and held\r\nout a card.\r\n\r\nTalbot took it. There was a single word in bold black letters on one\r\nside: TRANSPORTATION. The crosses on the T’s were spaceships. On the\r\nother side was a name: EVAN SOLERI, _vice-president in charge of\r\nresearch_. Talbot curled his fingers around the card.\r\n\r\nThe man smiled. “Just call me Evan.”\r\n\r\n“All right, Evan. You’re going to offer me a job.” Talbot settled back\r\ncomfortably. Things were falling into the routine pattern again.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps. But first--do you mind telling me why you keep getting fired?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t mind,” said Talbot. He was used to impertinent and stupid\r\nquestions. He was used to getting jobs in odd places and to the ups and\r\ndowns that always seemed to straighten themselves out eventually. Some\r\nday perhaps he’d find himself in a situation from which all his empathy\r\ncouldn’t rescue him. But he’d worry about that when it came.\r\n\r\n“You want to know why I get fired?” he asked, drawing the beer to him,\r\nand scowling across it. “Well, I’ll tell you. I meet someone like you.\r\nWe talk, and are friendly. First thing you know he is offering me a\r\njob. I take it. In the beginning everything’s fine. I have a knack of\r\nknowing exactly what he wants. I get a raise practically overnight.\r\n\r\n“Then one day _his_ boss comes in and wants something in a hurry. So he\r\ntalks to me very earnestly about it. Before anyone realizes what has\r\ntaken place his boss is depending on me instead of on him. So what can\r\nhe do? He finds some pretext and fires me.”\r\n\r\nEvan Soleri nodded. “And you don’t object?”\r\n\r\n“I get mad, naturally,” said Talbot. “But what else _could_ he do?\r\nHe’s worked hard for the job and I come along and threaten to take it\r\naway. The point is--I’ve got no special qualification.”\r\n\r\n“Except empathy.”\r\n\r\n“Except that,” agreed Talbot. He took a long drink and set the glass\r\ndown. “It’s funny. I get along well with people but my adjustment index\r\nisn’t so good.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve been thinking about that,” said Soleri. “Do you mind showing me\r\nyour employment card?”\r\n\r\n“Sure--step number one,” said Talbot. “When do I start?” He handed over\r\nthe card, and waved to the waiter for refills in the same motion.\r\n\r\nSoleri frowned at the card. “I notice you haven’t been tested in seven\r\nyears. Why haven’t you gone back for re-evaluation?”\r\n\r\n“It costs money,” Talbot replied. “Anyway, aptitudes don’t change much\r\nafter twenty-four.”\r\n\r\n“That’s usually true,” said Soleri, returning the card.\r\n\r\n“When do I start?” said Talbot. “To save trouble shall I have them make\r\nout the termination notice at the same time? They can safely date it\r\ntwo months in advance. I usually last that long.”\r\n\r\n“You may be surprised.” Soleri smiled. “I’ve a feeling you can work\r\nwell at the top. You’ve been starting too low.”\r\n\r\nTalbot studied the executive. Curiously enough, he had the same\r\nfeeling--if he ever got to the top. It was hard to do on ability alone.\r\nHe never lasted long enough for anyone to find out how good he was.\r\n“What sort of work am I supposed to do?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Interested?” said Soleri. “Have you heard of the perfect rocket motor?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve heard of it. Everybody has.” Talbot disposed of the beer. “It’s\r\nout of my line, though. I’m strictly business administration.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t prejudge what I have in mind,” said Soleri. “Have you also heard\r\nof Fred Frescura?”\r\n\r\n“The heat scientist?”\r\n\r\n“That’s right. The _foremost_ heat and rocket scientist.” Soleri moved\r\nthe glass aside. “As you know, present rockets are pretty poor. They\r\ntake us around the solar system, but that’s all. And they don’t do that\r\nvery well. Anyway, there’s mathematical proof that the theoretically\r\nperfect rocket motor can be built. We’ve been working on it for the\r\npast six years.”\r\n\r\n“Why come to me?” said Talbot. “I can’t help.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t be so sure. We want your empathy.”\r\n\r\n“You can have it,” said Talbot. “Look. One point five on the card,\r\nmaybe actually one point four by now. It levels off. You know the\r\nstandard curve as well as I do.”\r\n\r\n“The standard curve doesn’t always fit. That’s what I want to discuss.”\r\n\r\nTalbot might have stayed to talk it over, but he caught a strong surge\r\nof panic from the executive. Panic or trouble--or both. He didn’t want\r\neither. He had quite enough of his own. It wasn’t every day he lost\r\nhis job and his girl walked out on him.\r\n\r\n“I don’t feel in the mood for hashing this over,” he affirmed. “You’re\r\nexpecting a woman anyway.”\r\n\r\nSoleri smiled quizzically. “See? I told you that you’re underestimating\r\nthe strength of your empathy.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing to it. You were looking at every pair of legs that came by.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t think it was that easy. Why don’t you wait? Randy will be here\r\nany minute.”\r\n\r\nTalbot shook his head. “There’s no telling what Laura will do when she\r\nwanders out like this. She won’t go home, that’s for sure.”\r\n\r\n“I wish you’d reconsider.”\r\n\r\n“You can’t get a test tonight,” argued Talbot. “And a test is the only\r\nthing that will give us real information. I know what you’re going to\r\nsuggest--that I come in tomorrow morning. Fine. So I’ll do it--tomorrow\r\nmorning.”\r\n\r\nAgain Soleri smiled. “I said that you were my man. Now I’m sure of it.\r\nWill you come in early, at seven thirty, say?”\r\n\r\nTalbot could feel the other’s panic diminish. Maybe he was even better\r\nthan he thought--if he could produce that effect just by agreeing.\r\n“Seven thirty is pretty early,” he said.\r\n\r\n“There’s a reason for it,” Soleri assured him.\r\n\r\n“I bet.”\r\n\r\nSoleri took out a card and scribbled some careful directions on it.\r\n“Here,” he said. “Come in this way. Just walk right in. There won’t be\r\nanyone there at that hour of the morning except me.”\r\n\r\n“Sure.” Talbot stuffed the card in his pocket and wandered over to the\r\nscreen booth. He had trouble getting the connection, but when he did\r\nher father answered.\r\n\r\nHe had been correct in his assumption. He came out of the booth and\r\nstood for an instant at the bar, gulping down a drink. His head\r\nturned to follow the progress of a woman who had just entered the\r\ncafe. She had deep brown eyes and blonde hair, and a great deal more.\r\nThat helped. She was not only pretty--she was spectacular. He liked\r\nspectacular women.\r\n\r\nShe went on by, and stopped at the booth occupied by Soleri. Quite\r\nobviously she was Randy. For a moment he regretted his decision to\r\ngo in search of Laura. But only for a moment. Common sense told him\r\nhe wouldn’t have a chance of taking a woman like that away from a\r\nvice-president of TRANSPORTATION. The company just happened to be the\r\nlargest in existence.\r\n\r\nStill, it felt good to have a man of Soleri’s importance seek him\r\nout. He rolled the thought around in his mind. It was unquestionably\r\ntrue. Soleri had come looking for him. He knew it the way he knew so\r\nmany things--without thinking, by feeling alone, by the ability to put\r\nhimself in another’s place.\r\n\r\nBy the time the thought had come full circle in his mind Randy and\r\nSoleri were gone. It was Laura now--or nothing.\r\n\r\nHe went in search of her. She was not in any of the bars she usually\r\nfrequented. She was nowhere. There could be no doubt that she was mad\r\nat him this time, and would be for weeks--even when she learned what he\r\nhad coming up. She wanted to get married and was furious with him for\r\ndaring to put her off.\r\n\r\nIt took him quite a while to become absolutely convinced he wasn’t\r\ngoing to find her on what remained of his time, money, and drinking\r\ncapacity. He started home and Laura slipped out of his mind.\r\n\r\nIt certainly wasn’t accidental--his meeting with Soleri. Soleri had\r\nbeen looking for him. But why? How had he known where to look? Talbot\r\ncouldn’t concentrate solidly on the problem. It was all he could do to\r\nfigure out where the street was going to sway to next.\r\n\r\nOne thing was certain. He’d have a lot of questions to ask Soleri in\r\nthe morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n\r\n\r\nTalbot dressed numbly. It was early, damned early, and his head\r\nthrobbed. Aside from the physical discomfort involved he didn’t mind a\r\nhangover. He was more sensitive when he hung one on.\r\n\r\nHe was going to need that sensitivity when he talked to Soleri.\r\n\r\nThe man had a pretty phenomenal empathy index himself--say about 0.95.\r\nThe more he thought about it the more certain he became that it must\r\nbe at least 0.95. The executive had displayed uncanny acumen the night\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nTalbot swung a rack out of the closet and automatically selected\r\na light conservative suit. Soleri would expect him to dress\r\nconservatively. He didn’t care what Soleri thought, but it was a matter\r\nof pride with him to fit neatly into any situation.\r\n\r\nHe dialed a cup of coffee, and then on second thought changed it to two\r\ncups, and gulped both of them. He studied his reflection in the mirror.\r\nIt would do. He was the perfect picture of the successful executive.\r\nAll he lacked was success.\r\n\r\nHe resisted the impulse to phone Laura. He was convinced she wouldn’t\r\nanswer at seven in the morning. Probably she wouldn’t answer later in\r\nthe day. Maybe in a week he’d call her _after_ he got the job with\r\nTRANSPORTATION.\r\n\r\nHe went down and hailed an aircab which took him to the far side\r\nof the city. He alighted and read for the third or fourth time the\r\ninstructions Soleri had written on the card. He located the entrance\r\nwithout difficulty and went in. Normally, he supposed, there would be a\r\nreceptionist in the lobby. He didn’t see one. It was not important, for\r\nSoleri had cleared the way for him.\r\n\r\nHe ascended three flights of stairs, walked around a turn at the\r\ncorridor, and there he was--in front of Soleri’s office. It would be\r\njust his luck to find that he had arrived too early. But there was\r\ndefinitely someone in the office. He conquered his trepidation and went\r\nin.\r\n\r\nSoleri smiled and came toward him from behind the desk. His hand was\r\nextended and he was laughing. It was friendly laughter, and Talbot\r\ncould sense the friendliness. But he was unemployed, and for that\r\nreason he resented it.\r\n\r\n“My God,” said Soleri. “If we looked anything alike we’d be twins.”\r\n\r\nTalbot stared intently, reviewing and adding to his original\r\nimpressions of the other. They were within an inch and a pound of each\r\nother. Moreover they now wore identical suits and identical shoes and\r\nif there was a difference in their ties and shirts, it would have taken\r\nan expert to detect it. Talk about empathy! Soleri really had it.\r\n\r\nBut actually they didn’t resemble each other at all. Soleri’s hair was\r\nblack, and Talbot’s was brown. Soleri’s eyes were dark, Talbot’s gray.\r\nViewed from the back with a hat on they were indistinguishable. But\r\nface to face no one could have mistaken one for the other.\r\n\r\n“It’s an impressive trick,” Soleri chuckled. “If you’re trying to\r\nconvince me you’re good--relax. I believe it.”\r\n\r\n“I’m not trying to convince you of anything,” said Talbot.\r\n\r\nSoleri looked at him keenly. “You probably aren’t,” he said. “It ties\r\nin.”\r\n\r\nTalbot blinked. “Are you saying it’s _my_ empathy? One point four or\r\nfive isn’t _that_ good. Your own index must be zero point ninety-five.”\r\n\r\n“How did you know?” said Soleri. “I never told you.”\r\n\r\n“Why--” began Talbot, and stopped. How _had_, he known? It was one\r\nthing to think you knew, quite another to be always right. Something\r\nwas startlingly out of place.\r\n\r\nEmpathy measurements started in adolescence. Before then the body was\r\nin a state of flux. It was still building, exploring. It did not have\r\nthe experience on which to base valid opinions.\r\n\r\nThe adolescent was primarily aware of himself. He scarcely knew why\r\nhe thought and felt the way he did, and had no time to encompass the\r\nemotions of others. But as he matured and some of his own problems\r\nbecame settled, an increasing awareness grew in him. He became better\r\nable to anticipate and participate in the feelings of others. Not\r\nmerely to react to them, but to feel them as if they were his own.\r\n\r\nAfter adolescence the ability to identify with others continued to\r\nincrease--rapidly at first, and then more slowly. Plotted out as age\r\nagainst understanding, the curve resembled an hyperbola reaching for\r\nthe asymptote.\r\n\r\nSoleri smiled. “I see you’ve figured it out for yourself. We don’t\r\nthink you’re usual either. A test will decide the matter.”\r\n\r\n“The test can come later. Who’s ‘we’?”\r\n\r\n“Myself and Randy, my secretary.”\r\n\r\nInwardly Talbot sighed. He could hardly blame the guy. With a secretary\r\nlike that he couldn’t picture himself spending much time in an office\r\neither. Evidently Soleri and Randy didn’t. No doubt Soleri would claim\r\nthat last night’s meeting had come under the heading of business as\r\nusual.\r\n\r\n“Another thing,” he said. “How did you know I’d be at that bar?”\r\n\r\nSoleri shook his head in humorous resignation. “You don’t let much get\r\nby you. To be wholly frank, that’s why we want you. Well, if you must\r\nknow, we called your apartment several times in the last few days. You\r\nwere never home. So we put plant protection on you. It’s outside their\r\nnormal jurisdiction, but they learned your habits quickly enough.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t like to be snooped at,” protested Talbot. “I don’t even know\r\nhow you got my name.”\r\n\r\n“That one’s easy,” said Soleri. “Several years ago you filed an\r\napplication with us. I looked it over recently. I’m a mathematician--an\r\namateur but fairly good. I decided that if you’d put down the various\r\nempathy measurements correctly you might be better than you thought.\r\nOver a short portion of the curve, you know, a cubic or another\r\nequation can resemble an hyperbola. After Randy gets here we’ll see.”\r\n\r\nTalbot nodded. He could accept that. It helped to explain why he’d had\r\nso much trouble. People resented his competition. The thought gave him\r\nconfidence, and he reached out easily for the next conclusion.\r\n\r\n“But you’re not being altruistic about this,” he said. “I may have an\r\nindex of zero point nine, better than yours, way at the top of the\r\nexecutive class. But for all you know I may have no knowledge, no\r\nsubject matter in my head.” He paused to formulate the thought clearly.\r\n“You want me for something else. Specifically you’re in trouble.”\r\n\r\n“We may not need that test. But we’ll take it anyway,” said Soleri.\r\n“Yes, it’s trouble. Do you want to see if you can tell me what it is?”\r\n\r\nTalbot didn’t so much think as contact Soleri’s personality. He knew\r\nthat atomic energy was advanced and with it almost any degree of\r\ntemperature could be attained. And the hotter the exhaust, every other\r\nfactor being equal, the faster the rocket. He allowed the thought to\r\nfloat closer.\r\n\r\n“The technical problem is liners,” he said. “You’ve got to have\r\nsomething that won’t be melted or eroded by the exhaust.”\r\n\r\n“True,” said Soleri. “Metal or ceramics won’t do--not at the\r\ntemperatures we’re working with. We have made certain mathematical\r\ninvestigations which indicate there _is_ a solution. Metal plus\r\ncertain energy states might turn the trick.\r\n\r\n“We can discuss techniques later. It’s sufficient for now that we’ve\r\nnarrowed it down to a matter of trial and error. The rest should be\r\neasy enough: a million or so experiments and we’ll have it. We’ve hired\r\nthe best brains in the field, and you can be sure we haven’t spared\r\ntime or money. Only we aren’t making progress. The perfect rocket motor\r\nshould drive us at--or near--the speed of light. We’re nowhere near\r\nthat.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTalbot leaned on the desk. “Competition?” he asked thoughtfully.\r\n\r\nSoleri smiled painfully. “Perhaps. We’re big, but we’re not the only\r\ncompany after the motor. The difficulty arises from the fact that\r\nthere’s nothing definite we can point to as wrong. If there was, plant\r\nprotection would find the person or persons responsible and put an end\r\nto the obstruction in short order. What happens is simply this. Costly\r\nexperiments have one insignificant detail wrong, and blow up or fail to\r\nfunction at all. Elaborate computations have one decimal point moved\r\nand it takes a month to locate the impediment. Who’s behind it? What\r\nofficial or worker is out to sabotage us? That’s what we’re trying to\r\ndiscover.”\r\n\r\n“Did it ever occur to you that the perfect rocket motor may be an\r\nillusion? Perhaps it can’t be built.”\r\n\r\n“We have Frescura to say otherwise. Rocket construction is his life’s\r\nwork. Other experts in the field agree with him--though they are not\r\nalways able to follow his theoretical explanations.”\r\n\r\n“I won’t argue with them,” said Talbot. He glanced uneasily at the door\r\nof the office. A breeze was blowing it open slightly. “I see now why\r\nyou wanted me to come so early. It was to make sure I wouldn’t be seen?”\r\n\r\n“Right,” Soleri said. “I wanted to explain the situation and have you\r\nleave before the regular shift gets here. I’ll make arrangements for\r\nthe test to be given outside the plant. When you come back you’ll\r\nbe hired through regular channels. That way there’ll be no apparent\r\nconnection with me. You’ll simply be given a position in the shop. It\r\nwill be high enough to enable you to meet everyone, but it won’t be so\r\ntop-level that you’ll be prevented from mingling freely.”\r\n\r\n“I’m not sure I’m interested,” said Talbot. “If I’m as good as you\r\nthink I am--why should I take a job like that?”\r\n\r\n“It’s temporary, don’t you see? With your degree of empathy you can\r\ntrack down the trouble without arousing suspicion. After that we’ll\r\nput you where you belong. And your salary will be scaled to your test\r\nrating from the beginning, regardless of your workshop status. How does\r\nthat sound to you?”\r\n\r\n“Forthright,” said Talbot. “And quite generous.” He didn’t like to\r\nsnoop any better than he liked being snooped at. But he’d listen.\r\n\r\n“Randy’s due any moment,” said Soleri. “Let’s see that employment card\r\nagain.”\r\n\r\nTalbot reached for his wallet. The container the card was in didn’t\r\ndetach easily. He opened it, and handed the wallet to Soleri.\r\n\r\nSoleri examined the card with interest. He made a rough sketch of it\r\non paper, plotting the points of the series of tests and joining them\r\nwith a free-hand curve. He was so intent on the task that he failed to\r\nnotice that the office door had opened the width of a man’s hand.\r\n\r\nTalbot wouldn’t have noticed either, had he not turned at that precise\r\ninstant to get a better view of the sketch and seen the hand in the\r\ncrack. The hand threw a small dark object on the floor, then whipped\r\nback quickly. The door closed.\r\n\r\nTalbot’s reactions were good but not good enough. He jogged Soleri’s\r\nelbow. “What’s that?” he said uneasily, indicating the object.\r\n\r\nIt was round and dark, hard to distinguish on the floor. It took Soleri\r\na second to see it--a second too long. “Get down,” he shouted, shoving\r\nTalbot behind the desk.\r\n\r\nThe action threw Soleri offbalance and he fell the wrong way. He\r\nscrambled frantically for the protection of the desk but only his hand\r\nwith the wallet still in it reached the merciful shadow.\r\n\r\nA chaotic sound echoed somewhere near Talbot. He’d never heard\r\nanything like it. He didn’t have time to wonder where it came from\r\nbecause it was followed by another louder sound.\r\n\r\nInstinctively he closed his eyes as an incandescent sheet of flame\r\nwhipped across the room. It was accompanied by a vast thermal\r\nconcussion which blotted out all sound. Take a tiny piece of the\r\ninterior of the Sun--not the center, but somewhere between that and\r\nthe visible outer portion--and wrap it with unimaginable insulation.\r\nTransport it to an office and strip away the covering in a microsecond.\r\nWithin a limited area the explosion was even more frightful than that.\r\n\r\nAt first the desk shielded Talbot. In the intolerable light paint\r\nand pictures were burned from the wall. Chairs disappeared and the\r\nfireproof floor bubbled and vaporized. By the time the thick steel and\r\nthermoplastic desk collapsed in ashes around Talbot’s body the tiny\r\nspeck of matter had dissipated most of its energy and there was only\r\nfire to fear.\r\n\r\nClouds of steam came from the ceiling as the sprinkler system went into\r\naction. It didn’t function well because most of it had been melted away\r\nin the first blast. Nevertheless water gushed out and turned to steam.\r\n\r\nTalbot struggled to get out. But he was badly burned. Steam and smoke\r\nwere searing his lungs, and a section of the ceiling had peeled off and\r\nfallen on his legs, pinning him to the floor. He saw a hand, all that\r\nwas left of Soleri, clutching the wallet. And then he couldn’t breathe,\r\ncouldn’t see or feel anything at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n\r\n\r\nA dim, slender figure swirled dizzily in front of him. He hoped she\r\nwas a nurse, but he could only see the flowing whiteness of her as she\r\nmoved to the door. “You can come in, Miss Farrell,” she said.\r\n\r\nMiss Farrell came in. She was better known to Talbot as Randy, and\r\nclose up she was even more breathtaking than when he had first seen\r\nher. His vision was steadying a little now.\r\n\r\n“Just a few minutes--not longer,” the nurse cautioned.\r\n\r\nRandy sat down beside him, touching his face lightly. He could feel\r\nthe gentle pressure of her fingers through the bandages. “Don’t try to\r\ntalk,” she said. “I’ll say everything that has to be said. And it won’t\r\ntake long.”\r\n\r\nHe blinked in grateful understanding. It wasn’t a wholly satisfactory\r\nform of communication, but her nearness soothed him.\r\n\r\n“We haven’t found out how that thermal capsule got there,” she said.\r\n“We know it was hot, however. It had a temperature of at least a half\r\nmillion degrees, despite its extreme smallness. After you get well\r\nenough to talk freely we’ll try to reconstruct what happened.”\r\n\r\nHe nodded slightly, and the effort sent a wave of pain coursing through\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“So much for that,” she said. “You’ll get well. There won’t even be\r\nscars. You’re lucky. Did you know it?”\r\n\r\nHe knew it. But he knew also that it wasn’t _only_ luck. Soleri had\r\nsaved his life at the expense of his own.\r\n\r\nThen she said an incredible thing. “All we found of the other poor\r\ndevil was his lower arm. The card was still clutched in his hand. It\r\nwas scorched but not burned. I gave it to one of our mathematicians and\r\nhe has worked out two curves that might fit. The man was everything you\r\nsaid he was--and more. I wish he’d lived.”\r\n\r\nTalbot closed his eyes in stunned protest. She was making a mistake, a\r\ncrazy utterly incomprehensible mistake. He tried to tell her--but there\r\nwas only a gurgle in his throat.\r\n\r\n“Don’t bat your eyes at me,” she said in mock reproof. “It’s true. The\r\nlowest empathy index registered is zero point eight. Right? Well, this\r\nman was zero point five. The mathematician couldn’t be sure, but he\r\n_thought_ it might be even lower.”\r\n\r\nShe brushed the hair away from her lovely eyes. “Perhaps I should have\r\nkept it to myself. No one could possibly have the index the curve\r\nindicated. There are limits to human credulity.”\r\n\r\nAgain he tried to tell her that it was Soleri who had died. Soleri!\r\nBut the bandages were too tight and his weakness too overwhelming.\r\n\r\nBut how could she have made such a mistake? True, he’d been wearing\r\nthe same clothing as Soleri and the dead man had been clutching his\r\nemployment card. But a woman who had been close to Soleri, who had seen\r\nhim every day, would surely know--\r\n\r\nShe leaned over, brushing her lips against his eyes. “Don’t worry,” she\r\nsaid. “I disposed of the remains--and put him on the payroll. Roving\r\nassignment, reporting only to you. After six months we can arrange to\r\nmake it appear that he was killed in an accident.”\r\n\r\nHis eyes! She’d known Soleri well enough to remember that the dead\r\nman’s eyes were dark, not gray. Women were never in error about things\r\nlike that. He blinked frantically, but she failed to draw the correct\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\n“Why six months?” she smiled. “Because I have the company’s interest\r\nat heart. Otherwise we’d have to pay the full death benefit. If he’s\r\non the payroll after six months the insurance company must assume the\r\nresponsibility. His salary will be much less than the death benefit.\r\nHe’s dead. Nothing we can do will bring him back. We may as well save\r\nsome money.”\r\n\r\nThe logic was acceptable, but she had the wrong man. He groaned in\r\nfrustration and the sound escaped as a muffled protest from his\r\ntortured and burned throat.\r\n\r\nInstantly the nurse reappeared.\r\n\r\n“That’s all, Miss Farrell. He’ll rest better for knowing what happened.\r\nBut I think you’ve told him enough.”\r\n\r\nRandy bent over. “Everything’s all right,” she whispered. “Get well.”\r\n\r\nAnd then the nurse found an unbandaged region on his right shoulder and\r\njabbed him. He ceased to feel or hear anything.\r\n\r\nIt was that way for the next few days, a dim and shadowy routine which\r\nhe was vaguely and occasionally aware of. From time to time he felt\r\nstronger but the nurse had a needle ready and always used it. They\r\nintended to make certain that he did not prematurely exert himself.\r\n\r\nFinally a day came when the nurse wasn’t there. It had apparently been\r\ndecided that he was ready to rejoin the living. He lay motionless on\r\nthe bed, staring down at his folded arms. His right hand was bandaged;\r\nhis left was not. He raised both hands to his face. The bandages were\r\nfewer, lighter than before.\r\n\r\nSooner or later, he told himself, the bandages would have to come\r\noff. Then what? Then the truth would be known to everyone. Still, he\r\nwasn’t in an enviable position. He had gone at such an early hour to\r\nSoleri’s office that no one had seen him. He had only Soleri’s word as\r\nto his honesty of purpose--and Soleri was dead. Randy had made things\r\nworse with her silly attempt to hush things up. He was in a serious\r\nmess--and had no way of knowing what was going to come out of it.\r\n\r\nHe got up shakily. He had made up his mind. He must leave the hospital.\r\nHe knew it was foolish, but that didn’t stop him. He swung his legs\r\nover the side of the bed and found to his relief that he could stand.\r\nHe teetered precariously for an instant and then stood upright.\r\n\r\nThere was a closet on the opposite side of the room. He wobbled toward\r\nit, wrenched the door open. It contained a robe but no clothes. As he\r\nbraced himself in the doorway he caught sight of his face in the mirror\r\non the back of the door. His brow was gleaming with perspiration and\r\nhis eyes glittered darkly in the expanse of white. The bandages would\r\nhave to come off.\r\n\r\nIt was painful but not as bad as he had thought it might be. He found\r\nan edge and pried at the masklike plaster. The bandages came off in one\r\npiece. His raw skin burned as air came in contact with it. It stung and\r\nburned, but he scarcely noticed the pain.\r\n\r\nHe stared at his reflection.\r\n\r\nNow he knew what Randy had refused to tell him because she didn’t\r\nbelieve it herself. The empathy index of the man she supposed dead was\r\nnot zero point five. It was much less than that.\r\n\r\nIt was zero.\r\n\r\nAnd zero was identity.\r\n\r\nThe face looking back at him was not that of Hal Talbot. It was Evan\r\nSoleri. It was Evan Soleri even to the dark eyes and the stubble of\r\nblack hair that was beginning to grow in on his burned scalp.\r\n\r\nTalbot or Soleri, he went back to bed.\r\n\r\nHe lay very still. His mind raced back, to the scene in the office. He\r\nhad _thought_ there were two sounds, the strange one slightly before\r\nthe thermal explosion. But the first had not been a sound at all. He\r\nknew that now. It was Evan Soleri’s mental reaction to the approach\r\nof death. No one else could have heard it--no one except a man whose\r\nempathy index was zero. It was the crisis that had brought out his\r\nlatent ability. He had responded by recreating himself as the identity\r\nof a person a microsecond removed from extinction.\r\n\r\nHe had done this successfully--but what came next?\r\n\r\nHe had been thinking of escape. It was no longer possible. As far as\r\nhis immediate future was concerned he _was_ Evan Soleri. He might be\r\nable to prove otherwise. But it could be a dangerous undertaking. They\r\nmight think he’d had his face surgically altered with the deliberate,\r\nprior intention of replacing Soleri.\r\n\r\nBesides--well, he had liked Soleri. Without a second’s thought Soleri\r\nhad given his life for a man he hardly knew. Quite possibly the person\r\nwho had tossed in the thermal bomb had meant to kill Talbot. But he\r\nowed the unknown assassin something for that too.\r\n\r\nHis face hardened. In his new identity as Soleri he was in the\r\nbest possible position to track down the assailant. Soleri had been\r\npowerful, wealthy, the head of the research department. The place to\r\nbegin was right here, where it had started. He’d be Soleri.\r\n\r\nTalbot-Soleri rang for the nurse. He’d been inactive long enough. He\r\nhad no very definite plans, but he’d take care of things as they came\r\nup. The nurse came in. She stared at him in consternation.\r\n\r\n“You are not supposed to sit up,” she said. “And you must have been mad\r\nto take those bandages off. Here, I’ll put them back.”\r\n\r\nHe scowled at her, and she didn’t come near. “Get Miss Farrell,” he\r\nsaid. “Tell her I must see her at once.”\r\n\r\n“The doctor gave strict orders that you’re not to be disturbed,” said\r\nthe nurse hesitantly. She paled as he returned her stare, for there was\r\na dangerous light in his eyes.\r\n\r\n“Get her,” he demanded.\r\n\r\nWhen Randy entered the room there was a moment of complete silence. She\r\nseemed stunned by his aspect of well-being.\r\n\r\n“The miracle of medicine,” he said dryly. “Randy, I want to look over\r\nthe personnel records of everyone in the department. Please get them\r\nand bring them to me here.”\r\n\r\n“Everything?” She looked at him in amazement. “You went over the\r\ntechnical staff last week.”\r\n\r\n“It doesn’t matter,” he told her. “I’ve got some ideas I want to tie\r\ndown.” That was true, of course, but mostly he wanted to make sure he\r\nwouldn’t slip up on anyone he was supposed to recognize. He’d get by\r\nanyway, naturally. He could always claim a slight loss of memory due to\r\nshock. But such a claim wouldn’t inspire confidence--and he didn’t want\r\nanyone to become suspicious.\r\n\r\n“While you’re at it bring the office staff too,” he added. There was\r\none person he’d have to know as much about as possible. Much of it\r\nwouldn’t be in any file. But he’d worry about the intangibles later.\r\n\r\nRandy plainly thought his request was foolish, but she complied. Soon\r\nfiles were wheeled to his bedside. That was the nice thing about being\r\na big wheel in a big company, and no pun intended. Everything was\r\nhandy. Even the hospital was inside the plant.\r\n\r\nBut there were also disadvantages. The company was so big that\r\nthere was a lot to learn. Still, he had to begin somewhere. Randy\r\nundoubtedly thought some of his requests were strange, but she brought\r\nwhat he asked for. Though not eidetic, his memory was good. He began\r\nindustriously to absorb the information. Names, faces, facts and\r\ndiagrams settled firmly in his mind.\r\n\r\nIt was a lengthy, painful process. Sometimes he became confused as to\r\nhis actual identity. Was he Talbot or Soleri? The thought occurred to\r\nhim that he might never be able to step out of the character he had\r\nconsciously as well as unconsciously assumed.\r\n\r\nThere was no data on what might happen to him. None at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   IV\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the day of his discharge his skin was still tender but the burns had\r\nhealed. He felt weak but that was not surprising in view of the number\r\nof days he had spent in bed. The department managed without him and\r\nwhen difficulties developed he relayed brief orders through Randy. She\r\nwas his buffer. He didn’t want to take part in running the plant until\r\nhe had more insight on Soleri.\r\n\r\nHe learned many things, but there were technicalities to be mastered\r\nwhich he was sure he could pick up faster on the outside. The doctor\r\nwanted to send a nurse with him but he refused, finally consenting to\r\nhave Randy accompany him. Perhaps he was taking a needless risk. But he\r\nwas convinced he could handle Randy.\r\n\r\nIt was dark when they left the factory hospital, and took the\r\nelevator to the roof. He leaned on Randy somewhat more than he had\r\nto. It was a pleasure and a distraction. But he remained on his guard\r\nnotwithstanding.\r\n\r\nRandy was not a secretary at all. The files had revealed that much.\r\nSoleri had been so anxious to find out what was holding up the project\r\nthat he had hired a first-rate psychologist and had put her in a\r\nposition where she could work without being suspected. The psychologist\r\nwas Randy. She wouldn’t fool easy. And that, in a sense, was a\r\nchallenge. If he could get by her he could convince anyone.\r\n\r\nAn aircab was waiting. He leaned very close to her as she helped him\r\nin. He was almost sure that his empathy should tell him something and\r\nit did. Her eyes darkened, and she became obviously disturbed by his\r\nnearness. He settled back in the cab and waited.\r\n\r\nThe driver turned about, and asked: “Where to?”\r\n\r\nHe pretended not to hear. The driver repeated the question and Randy\r\ngave him the address. The information itself didn’t tell him much but\r\nhis sensitivity filled in the missing details. She had been to the\r\napartment many times, and stayed late.\r\n\r\nThey didn’t talk much on the way. The cab flitted over the city\r\nlights with a steady droning. He became uneasy. She too was sensing a\r\nstrangeness in him. He regretted his decision to have her accompany\r\nhim, and resolved to send her home as soon as he could reasonably do so.\r\n\r\nThey landed on the roof of a tall apartment building. She paid the\r\ndriver and told him not to wait. No chance for subtlety there.\r\n\r\n“I’m quite all right,” he said as she helped him out. “It was just a\r\nmomentary touch of dizziness.”\r\n\r\n“I know,” she said. “But you’re not going to get away. I intend to\r\nmake sure you’re all right.” And that was that.\r\n\r\nSoleri’s apartment was on the twentieth floor. It was elaborate and\r\nlarge, and furnished with exquisite taste. He approved of Soleri’s\r\ntaste--in more than one respect. He sat down and looked it over.\r\n\r\n“Glad to be back?” she asked.\r\n\r\nHe nodded.\r\n\r\n“Sit and rest. I’ll punch dinner. Anything special?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing special. Whatever you want.” She touched his arm as she went\r\ninto the kitchen. He wished she hadn’t. He had enough to contend with\r\nwithout that.\r\n\r\nPresently she came back. “We’ll have something light and nourishing in\r\na few minutes,” she said.\r\n\r\nShe went to the recording system and began examining the calls that had\r\ncome in during Soleri’s absence. He had to remind himself that it was\r\nan absence. Officially Soleri hadn’t died.\r\n\r\nHe watched her intently. He wished her eyes weren’t brown and wonderful.\r\n\r\n“Anything important?” he said with an effort.\r\n\r\n“A message from Andrew Taft. I told him you were hurt but not badly. He\r\nwants you to visit him next week.”\r\n\r\nAndrew Taft was president of TRANSPORTATION. Everyone knew that.\r\nBut there wasn’t anything in the files to give him a lead as to the\r\nduration or extent of their friendship. Perhaps Soleri had known Taft\r\nfrom boyhood. He didn’t want to put his newly acquired personality to\r\nsuch a severe test before he could be more certain of the facts.\r\n\r\n“Make an excuse for me,” he said.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him inquiringly. “Do you think you should? Eleanor will\r\nbe there. She heard about the accident and is coming in from Mars.”\r\n\r\nHe might have known there would be some such complication. Soleri was a\r\npowerful and attractive man and there had been more than one woman in\r\nhis life. It was another unexpected pitfall, a further challenge to his\r\nwariness. He grimaced. “Eleanor’s a nice girl but she means nothing to\r\nme,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Oh?” Randy’s lips tightened. “Is that why you’re going to marry her?”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the moment he hated Soleri, empathy or not. If it had been at all\r\npossible he would have dropped the pretense. But he couldn’t--and he\r\nhad to depend solely on his abnormal sensitivity. He told Randy what\r\nshe _wanted_ to hear.\r\n\r\n“You know how it is,” he said blandly. “I’ve got to get that motor\r\nbuilt. It’s costing far more than we expected. Somebody’s got to play\r\ncompany politics.”\r\n\r\nShe seemed a trifle mollified. “You needn’t tell me. I’ve had a\r\nthorough grounding in business psychology.” She moved quickly past him.\r\n“Dinner’s ready,” she said. “You’ve got to build up your strength--for\r\ncompany politics.”\r\n\r\nHe would have preferred silence but Randy insisted on holding up both\r\nends of the conversation. Nothing important was discussed, but it gave\r\nhim a chance to break down her defenses, and get to know her better.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner they sat over a drink, and talked. Much of his empathy was\r\ntied up in the difficult task of simply duplicating Soleri. He couldn’t\r\nget through to her with the accuracy he would have liked. But he did\r\nsucceed in turning the conversation from Eleanor. She was willing.\r\nAfter the first flash of hatred she was completely willing to forget\r\nthe girl existed.\r\n\r\nShe looked at the clock. “Time for bed,” she said.\r\n\r\nIt was awkward. He started to get up, avoiding her eyes. “I guess so,”\r\nhe said, letting her assist him, thrilled by her nearness.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing else he could do. She was attractive and he wanted\r\nher for himself. But she was desperately and unhappily in love with\r\nSoleri. He couldn’t let her know.\r\n\r\n“Randy,” he whispered softly as she clung to him. Laura seemed suddenly\r\nunreal and very far away, and he wished he’d never heard of Eleanor.\r\n\r\nLater he awakened to find her lying beside him, tense and still. She\r\nhadn’t been sleeping. In a surge of apprehension he wondered if she had\r\ndiscovered the truth about him.\r\n\r\n“Is anything the matter?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Nothing.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing? Is that why you’re not sleeping?”\r\n\r\n“Well, there is. I was thinking,” she said. “It was what I saw when I\r\nran into the office right after the explosion. The smoke was very thick\r\nand you were lying behind what was left of the desk. For an instant I\r\nwondered which one of you had died.”\r\n\r\n“How could you tell?” he said. “I was badly burned. My face--”\r\n\r\n“Your eyes are brown,” she said. “Brown. Anyway I knew. You _couldn’t_\r\ndie.”\r\n\r\n“Try to forget about it,” he said. “That nightmare is over. I’m alive.”\r\n\r\n“And so is Eleanor.”\r\n\r\nHe sighed, wishing again that he could tell her everything. But Soleri\r\nwould never deny the romance-shattering reality that stood between\r\nthem. “You’ve always known about her.”\r\n\r\n“So I have.” She moved closer to him. “I’m content with this brief\r\ndream of happiness.”\r\n\r\nThat was better. He caressed her lightly, tenderly. “It’s all right,”\r\nhe said soothingly. “Nothing has changed between us.”\r\n\r\n“I know, darling,” she murmured. He thought he heard her laugh before\r\nshe went to sleep.\r\n\r\nAt last he fell asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   V\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the next few days Talbot was feverishly busy. Just what inner\r\ndrives had dominated Soleri and how would he have reacted to any given\r\nsituation? What had been his precise relationships with the people\r\nTalbot would be meeting daily? Fortunately there was an accumulation\r\nof recorded calls and messages. He played and re-played them. He\r\nsubscribed to a clipping service and pieced together a fairly complete\r\naccount of Soleri’s social activities.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere were other rewarding sources. He scanned minutes of\r\nTRANSPORTATION meetings. He examined financial statements to give\r\nhimself another sidelight on the life he had usurped. Pictures,\r\nletters--even the apartment--added to his growing knowledge.\r\n\r\nHandwriting presented no difficulty. He found Soleri’s signature, and\r\nduplicated it on second trial. Soon he didn’t even have to try--it\r\nbecame second nature to him to forge Soleri’s name on letters and\r\ndocuments. Mannerisms came easily too. Ways of walking, the quick\r\nthoughtful smile that appeared at intervals, the clothes he wore and\r\nhow he wore them---all these distinguishing characteristics he copied\r\nwith little conscious effort. He was as much Soleri as another person\r\ncould be.\r\n\r\nHe rested and regained his strength, painstakingly sharpening himself\r\nuntil he was ready. Randy appeared frequently on the call plate,\r\nkeeping him informed of what went on at the plant. But she didn’t\r\nreturn to the apartment. He would have rejoiced in her presence but he\r\ndidn’t ask her. It would have meant taking a dangerous, unnecessary\r\nrisk.\r\n\r\nFinally he went back to work, nodding cheerfully to the receptionist in\r\nthe outer office as he turned left at the stairs. There was no trace of\r\ndamage in his private office. It had been rebuilt and refurnished and\r\nwas now exactly as he remembered it.\r\n\r\nRandy came in at once, cool and beautiful. “I told Frescura you’d like\r\nto see him,” she said. “He’ll be in his lab until noon.”\r\n\r\nFrescura, the famous heat and rocket scientist! He’d have to handle\r\nthat interview with care. He had no way of knowing how much technical\r\ninformation the man had imparted to Soleri.\r\n\r\n“I’ll see him but I hadn’t planned on it until later,” he said. It was\r\na false statement, but there was no need to take her completely into\r\nhis confidence.\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry,” she said with feigned meekness. “I was trying to\r\nanticipate.”\r\n\r\nHe knew that she was actively hating him for Eleanor. He’d have to find\r\nsome way to ease the tension. But at the moment other problems loomed\r\nmore urgently. He became expediently stern.\r\n\r\n“Forget the secretarial pose,” he growled. “You’re a psychologist.\r\nYour job is to find out who is resorting to deliberate sabotage in the\r\nplant. What does plant protection say about the thermal bomb?”\r\n\r\nShe met his gaze candidly. “Nothing. Anyone at all might have had\r\naccess to the hall.”\r\n\r\n“Then we’ll have to work at it from the other end,” he said.\r\n\r\nShe laid a sheaf of papers on his desk. He knew they were documents\r\nof no great importance. “Shall I tell Frescura you won’t be out?” she\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n“I’ll see him,” he said.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him oddly, and turned to go.\r\n\r\n“Randy.”\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\nHe didn’t know exactly what to say, so he tried it out for sound. “I\r\nstill want to find out why we’re not getting the motor. But it’s more\r\nthan simple sabotage now. A man was killed--a man I regarded as a\r\nfriend, even though I didn’t know him well. We’ve got to find out who\r\nis responsible. That comes first. Do you understand?”\r\n\r\nHer wonderful brown eyes regarded him steadily. She turned away. “I\r\nunderstand,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Keep it in mind,” he said. He got up and went to see Frescura.\r\n\r\nFred Frescura was a big man with more hair on his face than on his\r\nhead. He was nearly bald but his eyebrows and mustache were thick and\r\nblack. He had an air of concentration and childlike enjoyment of his\r\nwork. Neither impression, decided Talbot, was strictly accurate.\r\n\r\nHe crumpled a sheet of calculations as Talbot came in, and moved out\r\nfrom behind the desk. “I’m glad to see you,” he said gruffly. “For a\r\nwhile we weren’t sure whether you’d been cremated in the holocaust.”\r\n\r\n“It was more like an inferno,” said Talbot. “I survived.”\r\n\r\n“So I see,” said Frescura. “I tried to get to the hospital but Randy\r\nwouldn’t let me in. For three days she camped in the corridor.”\r\n\r\n“She takes excellent care of me,” acknowledged Talbot. He glanced at\r\nthe desk and suddenly turned pale.\r\n\r\nFrescura laughed reassuringly. “Don’t worry. These capsules are\r\nharmless or _I_ wouldn’t be here.” He picked up a few of the tiny\r\nblack cylinders and juggled them casually. “I was just attempting a\r\nreconstruction. What size was the thermal capsule which you saw?”\r\n\r\nTalbot touched the spheres gingerly. They were jet-black and\r\nfathomlessly unreflective. “This, I think,” he said. “Or possibly this.”\r\n\r\nFrescura laid five of the capsules down, rolling the other two in\r\nhis hand. “I’m afraid that doesn’t help much,” he said at last. “It\r\ndepends, you see, on how thick the covering was, and we can only guess\r\nat that. Let’s say the temperature was over a hundred thousand degrees.”\r\n\r\nThe temperature didn’t interest Talbot. He didn’t care by how much he’d\r\nnearly been vaporized. “Why don’t we use capsule material like this?”\r\nhe said. “It ought to make a good tube liner.”\r\n\r\nFrescura’s brows seemed to thicken and grow larger. “Are you seriously\r\nsuggesting that I start my experiments from the beginning? Four years\r\nago I told you we couldn’t use it. Now you act as if it’s something\r\nnew.”\r\n\r\nTalbot got out of the dilemma hastily. He regretted that he had not\r\nspent more time on the technical aspects. He’d tried to be thorough,\r\nbut failures were never recorded as thoroughly as triumphs.\r\n\r\n“It’s a thought,” he said, hoping the remark would pass for executive\r\nstubbornness. “Maybe we overlooked something.”\r\n\r\n“Maybe we _didn’t_,” growled Frescura. “The thinnest skin we can\r\nmake will hold a piece of matter at a hundred thousand degrees for\r\nten minutes. If we make it two inches thick it will last twenty-nine\r\nminutes and fourteen seconds. Constructed out of this a liner that\r\nwould do us any good would be a quarter mile in diameter at its widest\r\nsection. Is that practical?”\r\n\r\n“You might look into it again. You may have some new ideas,” said\r\nTalbot. He had avoided stumbling badly--and he’d learned something,\r\nalthough he should have known it in advance. The thermal bomb had been\r\nmade in the plant. He looked up quickly. “Just when did the technicians\r\narrive that morning? How many were in early?”\r\n\r\n“I went over that,” said Frescura. “So did plant protection. At least\r\nfifty men were asked in ahead of their shift. Several came in without\r\nbeing asked. But none of them were near your office.”\r\n\r\nIt was puzzling and significant. Soleri had been in charge for years\r\nwith no attempt on his life _until he, Talbot, had been brought in_.\r\n\r\nTalbot filed the fact away for future reference. Someone had known\r\nTalbot was going to come in that morning. Soleri had made it plain that\r\nRandy knew. But who else?\r\n\r\nWhom besides Randy had Soleri talked to? He couldn’t ask, but it was\r\nof vital importance. Whoever it was he had carefully manufactured the\r\nbomb in the laboratory, calculating the time by the thickness of the\r\nskin. That somebody had stuffed the capsule in his pocket and gone to\r\nSoleri’s office. When only a few seconds remained, he had rolled it\r\nthrough the door, giving himself just enough time to escape. But who\r\nwas he? Talbot had no idea.\r\n\r\nHe discussed the thermal bomb for a moment or two and then switched to\r\nthe progress on the motor. He listened to Frescura, who was more than\r\nwilling to talk. Soon, unless he could slide out of the invitation, he\r\nwas going to have to answer some far more pointed questions from Taft.\r\n\r\nStill discussing high, very high, and stellar temperature chemistry,\r\nthey went into the main experimental shop. This gave Talbot the\r\nopportunity of meeting the men he was supposed to have worked with for\r\nseveral years. There was a great difference between a picture and a\r\npage of statistics--even psychologically loaded statistics--and the\r\nman himself. He did a creditable job of imitating Soleri as he spoke\r\nto them. He had gone a long way toward merging with the dead man’s\r\npersonality. But there was always an incalculable risk involved in\r\nanything he might say or do.\r\n\r\nFrescura stopped expectantly beside a large construction site\r\nenclosure. “This is the latest,” he said in a hushed voice.\r\n\r\nTalbot looked at the work in progress critically. He was still at sea\r\nas to its more technical aspects. “Is this the project we were working\r\non before the accident?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Not exactly,” Frescura replied. “I’ve mentioned the theory before. But\r\nthe application is new.”\r\n\r\nTalbot was relieved. He wouldn’t be expected to know much about it. “Go\r\nover it for my benefit,” he urged. “Quite a bit has happened in the\r\ninterval.”\r\n\r\nFrescura glanced at him queerly, and he regretted having made the\r\nrequest. “You ought to remember this,” said the scientist. “Well,\r\nit’s off the mainline of our experiments, but I thought we might get\r\nsome constructive results. We make the tube of dissimilar metals, one\r\njacketing the other. When it is heated we get a thermocouple effect.\r\nAn electric charge is generated. The charge on the inside of the tube\r\nrepels the exhaust molecules so that they don’t actually come in\r\ncontact with the inside surface. This reduces both heating and erosion.”\r\n\r\nTalbot rubbed his head. “I remember. Is it ready to go?”\r\n\r\n“It is,” said Frescura grimly. “But don’t stand there unless you want\r\nanother accident.”\r\n\r\nTalbot got out of the way hastily. He was blundering in practically\r\nevery statement he made. There was far more to a person than\r\npersonality, or his outward appearance. In Talbot’s particular case\r\nknowledge was lacking--not textbook information, but intimate details\r\nthat could be acquired only by working closely with the man he was\r\nimpersonating. So far it hadn’t been serious. But he’d have to watch\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nFrescura moved a switch, and there was a rumble within the enclosure. A\r\ntiny, barely visible flame shot out a foot from where Talbot had been\r\nstanding. The rumble rose to a shriek, and quickly passed beyond the\r\nrange of hearing. The flame disappeared, but Talbot could still feel\r\nthe heat.\r\n\r\nFrescura picked up a wrench and tossed it into the path of the exhaust.\r\nThe instrument vanished and the huge curved backstop a hundred feet\r\naway was suddenly coated with a thin film of molten metal. Frescura\r\ngrinned at him.\r\n\r\n“You’ve got to watch these things,” he said. He peered into an\r\neyepiece on the enclosure, making several adjustments before he seemed\r\nsatisfied. “Take a look,” he said to Talbot.\r\n\r\nTalbot looked, his eyes gradually growing accustomed to the intense\r\nlight that passed through the dense filters. He could see the inside\r\nof the rocket tube, and the fierce incandescence shooting by. Actually\r\nnone of the exhaust gasses touched the walls of the tube, for there\r\nwas a static area an inch in thickness next to the wall where nothing\r\nseemed to penetrate.\r\n\r\nAs he tried to see more clearly exactly what was happening the\r\nenclosure began to vibrate again, shaking the foundation. But the metal\r\nheld. The shriek declined to a rumble and then the sound died away\r\ncompletely.\r\n\r\nTalbot blinked and straightened up. Frescura was jotting down\r\nreadings from the instruments on the enclosure. He made a few quick\r\ncalculations. “The test corresponds to a rocket speed of thirty\r\nthousand miles a second,” he said.\r\n\r\nIt was a long way from what they wanted, but it was about fifteen\r\ntimes better than anything that had been attained before. “Not bad,”\r\nTalbot said, cautiously. “Maybe we should settle for this. One sixth\r\nthe speed of light. Twenty-five years to the nearest star.”\r\n\r\nFrescura scowled at him. “Make it thirty,” he said. “They’ve got to get\r\nup speed and slow down. Thirty to the star and thirty back. Sixty years\r\nfor the round trip, not counting exploration time.”\r\n\r\n“I understand,” Talbot said. “But with a young crew--boys not over\r\ntwenty-two or three--it’s possible to send a ship to the nearest star\r\nand reasonably expect it to return.”\r\n\r\n“They’ll be eighty when they come back,” said Frescura. “Their friends\r\nwill all be dead.”\r\n\r\n“There are some lads who will volunteer--if the rewards are high\r\nenough.”\r\n\r\n“No doubt,” said Frescura. “But there’s one detail which prevents\r\nit--building a rocket motor which will last for more than a few\r\nseconds.”\r\n\r\n“You’ve already accomplished a great deal,” said Talbot.\r\n\r\n“This?” Frescura laughed. “No good at all. You saw what just happened.”\r\n\r\n“I did. You shut off the motor.”\r\n\r\nFrescura looked at Talbot with sour amusement. “It was the automatics\r\nthat cut off the flow of fuel. Didn’t you see it? The inner charge\r\nrepelled matter, but it _couldn’t stop radiation_. Radiation heated\r\nthe tube. As it grew hot beyond a certain temperature the thermocouple\r\ncharge diminished, intensifying the heat transfer to the tube. When it\r\nwent, it fell apart in a hurry.”\r\n\r\nTalbot frowned. “There’s no way around it?”\r\n\r\n“None I know of. I’ll keep trying of course. With another hundred\r\nmillion dollars we might make this work even though it’s far from what\r\nwe’re after.”\r\n\r\nTalbot shook his head in admiration. Frescura tossed huge sums about\r\nwith utmost ease. “Keep with it,” he said. “We’ve got to lick this or\r\nit will finish us.”\r\n\r\n“We’ll come out on top,” said Frescura optimistically.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately Talbot didn’t have the same confidence. “Economize where\r\nyou can,” he cautioned.\r\n\r\n“There is no such thing as economy in research,” Frescura affirmed.\r\n\r\n“There had better be. We’re running low. Accounting is beginning to ask\r\nquestions. We’ll have to go to the board of directors before long.”\r\n\r\n“I guess so. The accident cost plenty.” Frescura leaned against the\r\nenclosure, rubbing it with unconscious affection. “If you need help,\r\nlet me know. I’ll add my weight to yours.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll let you know,” said Talbot as he walked away.\r\n\r\nThe trouble with Frescura was that he was a theoretical scientist,\r\ncompletely indifferent to cost. As he went through the plant he saw\r\ncountless examples of waste. There was endless duplication, and the\r\nplace seemed overstaffed. But, though he could undoubtedly reduce costs\r\nwith efficient administration, that was not the most vital problem.\r\n\r\nHe had to locate and unmask a man who did not shrink from cold-blooded\r\nmurder. It couldn’t have been Soleri. A successful saboteur would\r\nnot have sought out Talbot to help him. Neither would he have killed\r\nhimself. And it could not have been Randy. The trouble had begun long\r\nbefore she had been hired. It wasn’t Frescura, for he had not only\r\ninitiated the project. He had pushed it through with all the influence\r\nat his command.\r\n\r\nTaft was still unaccounted for. But he was the president of the company\r\nand it was inconceivable that he would launch a criminal conspiracy\r\nagainst his own interests.\r\n\r\nNevertheless Talbot made up his own mind. His extreme sensitivity was\r\nhis most valuable weapon. He intended to find out just how far it would\r\ntake him. He completed the tour of the plant and went back to the\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nHe called Randy, and immediately took up the problem of Taft. “I still\r\nhaven’t answered his invitation,” he told her.\r\n\r\nHer eyes clouded. “I know,” she said. “I’ll notify the department heads\r\nthat you won’t be in the plant for a few days--beginning Wednesday.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll be here,” he said. “I want you to dream up an excuse why I can’t\r\ngo. Make it good. I trust your social sense.”\r\n\r\n“You can’t do that,” she protested. “Have you seen the latest statement\r\nfrom accounting?”\r\n\r\n“I have. We’ll need funds before long.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t turn down an invitation from the president when you may need\r\nhis help.”\r\n\r\n“You do when there are graver issues at stake. I’ve got to begin\r\nsomewhere. The top is a good place.”\r\n\r\n“A dangerous place,” she said.\r\n\r\n“I’m not thinking about that.”\r\n\r\n“You’d better,” she said. “Unless--have you got a cushion?”\r\n\r\n“In a way,” he said. “Somebody wants this project to fail, badly enough\r\nkill anyone who stands in his way. Good, we’ll let it come close to\r\nfailure. We’ll see if there is any attempt made to interfere--”\r\n\r\n“You’re the boss,” she shrugged.\r\n\r\n“I hope it works.”\r\n\r\n“It will.”\r\n\r\nHe flung himself into his work for the remainder of the afternoon.\r\nFacts and figures went into his head and what came out was a reasonable\r\nduplication of what Soleri had known.\r\n\r\nHe finished late. Most of the office force had gone home. A few\r\ntechnicians were working in the shop. Tired and numb he took an aircab.\r\nTwenty moments later he was letting himself into his apartment. He\r\nwasn’t imagining it. There was someone in the apartment. Still, Soleri\r\nwould inevitably have visitors now and then. It was nothing to be\r\nafraid of. He went in.\r\n\r\nRandy smiled at him. “Hello, darling,” she said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   VI\r\n\r\n\r\nFrescura got up hastily as he heard Taft’s familiar voice in Randy’s\r\noffice. “I’ll leave,” he said, folding the sheet Talbot had just signed.\r\n\r\n“Stick around,” Talbot urged. “I’m sure he wants to see you.” He hadn’t\r\nthought Taft would come so soon, but he was not at all displeased. He\r\nwas equally grateful for Frescura’s presence, feeling confident that\r\nit would provoke some interesting reactions. But he was destined to be\r\ndisappointed.\r\n\r\nFrescura wriggled his thick mustache. “I came up to ask Randy\r\nsomething. I’ll go talk to her. If Taft wants to see me he’ll come out\r\nto the lab.”\r\n\r\n“Suit yourself,” said Talbot.\r\n\r\nFrescura left. He could hear him conversing briefly with Taft in\r\nRandy’s office before Taft came in.\r\n\r\nAndrew Taft was not the lean graying figure so familiar to the newscast\r\npublic. He was tall, but he was also considerably heavier than he\r\nappeared to be on the screen. Distinguished citizens had certain\r\nprerogatives, and the networks saw to it that the lighting dealt kindly\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\n“Sorry about the party,” Taft said on entering. “I flew up to try to\r\npersuade you to change your mind.”\r\n\r\nTalbot shook hands, using his most cautious Soleri approach. “You know\r\nhow it is,” he said in half-apology. “I’ve fallen behind since the\r\ntragedy. I’ve got to dig my way out.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve worried about you,” said Taft. “So has Eleanor.” He glanced up\r\nquickly. “Your insistence on shunning social engagements doesn’t have\r\nanything to do with her, does it?”\r\n\r\n“It doesn’t,” Talbot assured him.\r\n\r\n“South Africa may be a nice place to live. But it’s quite a distance.\r\nAnd I really am in a mess here.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense. You can fly there in a few hours,” said Taft.\r\n\r\n“Eight,” Talbot reminded him. “Service isn’t good to that part of the\r\nglobe.”\r\n\r\n“You can cut the time in half if you charter a direct flight,” said\r\nTaft. “I suppose it would tire you out. But over-work can kill. You\r\nought to call Eleanor. You know she won’t take the initiative.”\r\n\r\nTalbot decided to risk a decisive move. “I’ll call her now,” he said.\r\n\r\n“No, wait until I leave,” said Taft hastily. “I don’t want her to know\r\nI came to see you.”\r\n\r\n“Tonight then,” suggested Talbot.\r\n\r\n“Tonight’s fine,” said Taft. He chatted on inconsequentially for a\r\ntime. Talbot could see that Soleri’s relationship with Eleanor’s\r\nfamily--though nominally cordial--was actually quite superficial,\r\nexcept possibly with Eleanor herself. He would have to be careful not\r\nto trip there.\r\n\r\n“What’s behind all this?” said Taft finally. “I know you. You work\r\nhard, but you can also relax. You’re not the kind to turn down an\r\ninvitation just because you’re busy.”\r\n\r\nHe’d judged the man correctly. Taft was shrewd, and quick to protect\r\nhis own interests, daughter or company. “I may as well be frank,” said\r\nTalbot heavily. “I’m afraid we’re not going to develop the perfect\r\nrocket motor--or anything close to it.”\r\n\r\n“That’s not what you said in your last report.”\r\n\r\n“Official optimism.”\r\n\r\n“It’s not Frescura’s attitude. I talked to him in Randy’s office and\r\nhe’s brimming over with enthusiasm.”\r\n\r\n“Frescura will back his own work if it takes the last cent of the\r\nstockholders’ money.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t forget that some of that money belongs to him. He has stock in\r\nthe company too. In fact, his holdings exceed yours.”\r\n\r\n“I know. But we’ve spent six times the amount we originally estimated.\r\nAnd the end’s not even in sight. I haven’t made up my mind, but I’ve\r\nbeen wondering lately. Perhaps we should abandon this line of research\r\nentirely. It may be the wisest course.”\r\n\r\nTaft stared at him, aghast. “You must be out of your mind. What would\r\nwe do with this plant? Close it down?”\r\n\r\n“We don’t have to. We can lease research facilities to other companies.\r\nWe can tackle short-range projects that _will_ pay off.”\r\n\r\nTaft got up and paced the floor. “You’re in favor of abandoning the\r\nperfect rocket motor?”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t say that. I merely said that I was thinking about it. Of\r\ncourse an alternative would be to reduce the scale of our efforts. Cut\r\nit back to a few men--something that we can afford.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” said Taft in agitation. “Frescura isn’t going to like\r\nthis.”\r\n\r\n“That’s another matter I wanted to discuss with you,” said Talbot.\r\n“Frescura is a valuable man--too brilliant to be wasted on a project\r\nthat has no chance of success. We should assign him to something more\r\nworthy of his talent.”\r\n\r\nTaft sat down. “You are actually saying that we should forget about\r\ngoing to the stars.”\r\n\r\n“Not exactly. I think the idea should be placed in the proper\r\nperspective. Later developments may enable us to resurrect it.” Talbot\r\nwas somewhat bewildered. Taft’s reaction had surprised him--although he\r\ncouldn’t have said quite what it was that he had expected.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you see what it means?” said Taft, his face lighting up. “If we\r\ndevelop the motor in our own shops it will be _ours_. We won’t have to\r\nlicense it to others. Every bit of interstellar trade will be carried\r\nin our ships. Ours alone. _Monopoly_.”\r\n\r\n“Monopoly is nice,” said Talbot. “Bankruptcy isn’t. That’s what we face\r\nunless we cut down.”\r\n\r\n“TRANSPORTATION is years away from bankruptcy,” said Taft sharply.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was a shock to hear even that admission. Talbot’s own knowledge of\r\nthe company’s financial position was fair. But Taft was in a better\r\nposition to know the facts and if he said, even privately, that ruin\r\nwas years away it could be assumed that he had grave doubts about the\r\nstability of the corporation.\r\n\r\nThe startling fact stood revealed in all its naked ugliness. The\r\nlargest company in the solar system was none too secure. And it was the\r\nreckless expenditures that Soleri was directing that had led them to\r\nthe brink of disaster. At least he had uncovered one motive. Someone\r\nwith a knowledge of the truth was out to wreck TRANSPORTATION.\r\n\r\nBefore he could collect his thoughts there was an unexpected\r\ninterruption. The door opened and Frescura came in, his face dark with\r\nanger. “As long as this is a stockholders’ meeting I thought I’d make\r\nit a quorum,” he said.\r\n\r\nThis much Talbot knew. Taft was the largest individual holder, owning\r\nsomething less than fifty percent of the total corporate shares.\r\nFrescura held a lesser percentage, though fractionally more than Soleri\r\ndid. Together the three of them constituted an actual working majority.\r\nIt had been their combined votes which had backed the project from the\r\nbeginning.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t mean to eavesdrop,” said Frescura. “Randy touched the wrong\r\nbutton while we were talking and I overheard part of the conversation.\r\nIt concerned me--so I came in.”\r\n\r\n“We were discussing policy,” said Taft soothingly. “Nothing was\r\ndecided. You understand that.”\r\n\r\n“I understand,” said Frescura in a hard set tone. “I also understand\r\nthat this man is dangerous. He is _not_ Soleri.”\r\n\r\nThe assurance that Talbot had gradually been acquiring suddenly\r\ncollapsed. He sat motionless, while a cold constriction tightened about\r\nhis heart.\r\n\r\nTaft looked from Talbot to Frescura. “You can’t be serious? I ought to\r\nbe able to recognize my chief executive and my own daughter’s fiance.”\r\n\r\n“Ordinally you would. But this man is a clever impostor,” said\r\nFrescura. “He wants to abandon the project. Soleri would have recoiled\r\nfrom the thought.”\r\n\r\n“I see no significance in that. Anyone can change his mind.”\r\n\r\n“Proof is on the way,” said Frescura. He seemed very sure of himself.\r\n“I began to suspect him when he put questions to me Soleri would not\r\nhave needed to ask.”\r\n\r\n“It still isn’t proof.” But Taft was wavering. He turned and stared\r\nuncertainly at Talbot.\r\n\r\n“You can’t expect me to defend myself from a charge like this,” said\r\nTalbot. He realized at once that it was a weak answer, and tried to\r\nstrengthen it. “The fire in my office wasn’t trivial. It’s true, I may\r\nhave suffered a slight memory loss. The bursting of a few tiny blood\r\nvessels in my brain would account for it. But that doesn’t mean I’m\r\nless capable than before.”\r\n\r\nThere was no possibility of escape. At Frescura’s command plant\r\nprotection would close every exit in the building. And then he’d be\r\ncharged with sabotage and murder.\r\n\r\nHe had to sit it out. If he was exposed his only chance would be to\r\nclaim that for a time he had actually thought himself to be Soleri.\r\nThey’d investigate him psychologically, but mind tests weren’t exact\r\nand he had a good chance of making them believe he was telling the\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\n“Nobody’s doubting your mental competence,” said Taft. “But there is\r\nsome question as to who you are. Are you Evan Soleri?”\r\n\r\n“What can I say to that?” said Talbot. “Are you Andrew Taft?”\r\n\r\n“That’s not a defense,” said Frescura with smooth confidence. “It won’t\r\nbe difficult to establish your identity.” He turned abruptly. “Come in\r\nRandy.”\r\n\r\nThe door opened and Randy entered the room. Talbot was sure she had\r\nbeen listening to the entire conversation. He had never doubted her\r\nloyalty, but if Frescura had convinced her that he was not worthy of\r\nloyalty--\r\n\r\nFrescura took the folder from her. Talbot knew what was coming but\r\ncuriously it relieved him. At least Randy wasn’t responsible.\r\n\r\n“You can leave now,” Frescura said sharply to her. Talbot knew she\r\nwould continue to listen outside the door, and was glad he would not\r\nhave to see her face.\r\n\r\n“His right hand was badly burned,” Frescura was saying. “New skin was\r\ngrafted on. We can’t prove anything from that.”\r\n\r\n“Fingerprints?” said Taft. “It’s an old method of identification, but\r\nI’ve often wondered why it has fallen into disrepute.”\r\n\r\n“Because of the prevalence of skin grafts,” said Frescura. “But for\r\ncertain purposes it’s still the most accurate method.” He smiled. “It’s\r\nin the hospital record that his left hand wasn’t burned. No skin was\r\ngrafted on. The prints on that hand will show us who he really is.”\r\n\r\nHe shook the folder at Talbot. “This man signed an authorization\r\nshortly before you came. When I heard what he said to you my suspicions\r\nwere confirmed. I sent Randy down to plant protection for a comparison\r\nof prints. Here are the results.”\r\n\r\nHe opened the folder, and looked at the three typed pages within. He\r\nstood there motionless, staring in consternation until the papers slid\r\nout and fluttered to the floor. His face was ashen. He reached out for\r\nsupport and lowered himself into a chair.\r\n\r\n“What does it say?” said Taft impatiently. “My God, what’s happening\r\naround this place anyway?” He scooped up the papers and read them\r\nsilently. He passed them over to Talbot. “I’m sorry,” he said. “Truly\r\nsorry. I should never have had even the slightest doubt about you.”\r\n\r\nTalbot’s sight blurred as he read the comment from plant protection:\r\n“Comparison of prints with those in our file reveals that Evan Soleri\r\nsigned this authorization. The left hand prints match perfectly. The\r\nright hand indicates a skin graft from which no identification can be\r\nmade.”\r\n\r\nEmpathy had saved him. It had collapsed the difference between one\r\nperson and another to nothing--zero. It had changed more than his face\r\nto match the subject identity. To the tips of his fingers he was now\r\nSoleri. The change hadn’t been made all at once; perhaps it had taken\r\na week to reach completion. But here he was, safely Soleri--or trapped\r\nin the other identity. For the moment he preferred to think of it as\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\n“There are other tests,” he said to Frescura. “I’ll take them all,\r\nincluding the empathy index.”\r\n\r\nFrescura stirred dully. “It will be zero point ninety-five,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Don’t bait him,” said Taft sharply. “He made a mistake, granted. He\r\naccused you unjustly. But you must remember that you attacked a project\r\nhe has devoted his life to. He’s emotionally upset. What he did was\r\nunderstandable.”\r\n\r\nFrescura’s eyes roamed across the ceiling. “I couldn’t let you stop\r\nme,” he whispered.\r\n\r\nTaft grasped his shoulder encouragingly. “Nothing will stop us. We’re\r\ngoing to the stars--no matter what it costs. However, you’ve been\r\nworking too hard. I’ll send my doctor to you. He’s strict about some\r\nthings but he’s the best. He’ll get you back in shape.”\r\n\r\nTaft turned to Talbot. “As for you, I don’t like memory lapses, even\r\nin minor matters. I want you to promise me you’ll see my doctor after\r\nhe gets through with Frescura.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll be glad to,” Talbot said, without animosity. “I’ve been wondering\r\nwhat to do.”\r\n\r\nTaft swung back to Frescura. By some personal miracle the man had\r\npulled himself together again. He was alert and forceful. Taft regarded\r\nhim with approval.\r\n\r\n“That’s better. Go home and rest. Don’t work today.”\r\n\r\n“You’re right,” Frescura said. “I should do that. I’ll have to drop by\r\nthe lab and tell the boys I won’t be in for a few days.”\r\n\r\n“Evan will tell them. We’ll call a cab and get you on your way. Don’t\r\nworry about anything. The project will be continued.”\r\n\r\nThey waited until Frescura left in an aircab. Taft got up, shaking his\r\nhead bewilderedly. “Well, I’ll go too. Don’t forget that call tonight.”\r\n\r\n“I won’t. I’ll be sure and call her.”\r\n\r\n“Good.” Taft wiped his forehead. “This has been a hassle. We have them\r\noccasionally but I’ve never seen one to equal this.” Still shaking his\r\nhead he went away.\r\n\r\nTalbot leaned back and closed his eyes. He had achieved a victory\r\nthat was far from superficial and it gave him a feeling of personal\r\nsolidity. He was Soleri and he was going to be Soleri and nobody would\r\never know the difference.\r\n\r\nBut the rest didn’t make sense.\r\n\r\nBoth Taft and Frescura were now beyond suspicion. He had nothing to go\r\non--nothing at all. He’d have to re-examine the whole problem from the\r\nbeginning. Somewhere within the plant was a criminal conspirator who\r\ndidn’t want TRANSPORTATION to develop the perfect rocket motor. He was\r\nstill there. He had killed once, and he wouldn’t hesitate to kill again.\r\n\r\nWhy? If he could put his finger on the man’s motivating impulse he\r\ncould track him down with little trouble. Somehow it seemed to go far\r\nbeyond ordinary commercial rivalry.\r\n\r\nTalbot heard a sound at his elbow and opened his eyes. Randy was\r\nstanding beside the desk.\r\n\r\n“Sleeping?” she asked, smiling at him.\r\n\r\n“No, just thinking,” he said.\r\n\r\nShe leaned toward him. “Think about this then. I want to leave early.”\r\n\r\nHe stared at her, puzzled. “No. There’s work to do.”\r\n\r\n“But there isn’t,” she assured him. “I ought to know.”\r\n\r\nHe realized then that she wanted him to know that she had listened\r\nto most of the conversation. Probably she’d read the note from plant\r\nprotection. Talbot thought of the call he’d have to make later. He had\r\nno desire to make her listen to that too.\r\n\r\n“All right,” he said. “I guess you know by now that I can’t play the\r\nstern employer when you look at me like that.”\r\n\r\nShe smiled at him, turned and went out.\r\n\r\nHe remained in his office thinking throughout the afternoon. He went\r\nhome late--and alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VII\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a dim corner of the apartment Talbot fingered a picture of Eleanor.\r\nSoleri’s taste in women closely paralleled his own. From a distance\r\nEleanor could be mistaken for Laura. She was a trifle prettier perhaps,\r\nmore lighthearted and whimsical, and more used to having her own way.\r\n\r\nHe didn’t want to put through a long-distance call to her. He was\r\nentangled enough as it was with Randy, the three-cornered struggle\r\nbetween himself, Taft and Frescura and the unknown obstructionist in\r\nthe plant, not to mention the perfectly efficient rocket motor that was\r\nnever going to be built.\r\n\r\nHe laid the picture face downwards on his desk, and went to the screen.\r\nBut he didn’t call Eleanor Taft in her South African home. He called\r\nRandy.\r\n\r\nShe answered in a charming state of dishabille. “Is this the way you\r\nalways come to the screen?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“I knew it was you,” she replied. “I’m only surprised that you didn’t\r\ncall sooner.”\r\n\r\n“Put some clothes on,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you like it? Or are you asking me to come over?”\r\n\r\n“I like it,” he said. “But don’t come over. Not yet. I want some\r\ninformation. Precisely what did you do this afternoon?”\r\n\r\nShe made a face. “It was awful. Candidly I thought I’d stumbled into\r\nan old fashioned mental institution. I never would have believed I was\r\neavesdropping on a high-level conference between the three top minds in\r\nthe biggest corporation in the system.”\r\n\r\n“We’re human too,” he said gloomily. “At least I think we are. What I\r\nmeant was: What did you do when Frescura came out of my office and Taft\r\nwent in?”\r\n\r\n“Do you want a detailed report?”\r\n\r\n“Yes--all of it. Exactly as it happened.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Frescura came out and talked to Taft for a moment. Taft went in\r\nto see you, and Frescura wanted some information from another office.\r\nHe sent me to get it. When I came back he handed me the folder and told\r\nme to take it to plant protection. He said to wait there for results\r\nand bring it back as soon as I could.”\r\n\r\n“Is that all?”\r\n\r\n“That’s all.”\r\n\r\n“Good,” Talbot said. “Put on your clothes and come over.”\r\n\r\n“I’m glad you changed your mind.”\r\n\r\n“So am I. But I won’t be home when you get here. I may not be back\r\nuntil quite late. Whatever you do, don’t leave the apartment until I\r\nreturn. Promise?”\r\n\r\n“What choice do you give me? I’ll wait.”\r\n\r\nHe cut off the screen and reached for a jacket. With methodical\r\npersistence he went through Soleri’s possessions until he found a gun.\r\nHe had expected to find one. He checked it swiftly to make sure that\r\nit was loaded and in working condition. It was. He pocketed it with\r\nsatisfaction and called a cab. He had to hurry.\r\n\r\nHe saw from the air that the entire plant was dark except for a light\r\nin one of the offices. Even from a distance he thought he could tell\r\nwhich office it was. The cab landed, and he got out. There was a guard\r\nat the office entrance. He questioned the man quickly, and thoroughly.\r\n\r\nThe plant was closed down tight. All of the other gates were securely\r\nlocked and would remain closed until morning. The guard hadn’t seen\r\nanyone leave or enter the building. He didn’t know whether or not the\r\noffice was occupied but it was reasonable to suppose that someone might\r\nbe working late. Talbot stood back and looked. The light wasn’t visible\r\nfrom the corridor entrance.\r\n\r\nTalbot told the guard to stop anyone who came out. He went in and made\r\na tour of the offices. They were all dark. The man in the lighted\r\noffice had apparently heard Talbot enter the building and had left\r\nahead of him.\r\n\r\nTalbot moved warily into the main shop. It was huge, cavernous and dim.\r\nHe would not have been able to see at all except for the luminous strip\r\nwhich edged the aisles. Shadows loomed on the walls and ceiling and\r\nit would have been a simple matter for an intruder to conceal himself\r\nbehind one of the machines.\r\n\r\nHe went on. None of the laboratories were lighted. Back and forth\r\nacross the plant he went, always sure there was a man just ahead of him\r\nhe could never quite overtake. He turned and had begun to retrace his\r\nroute when a light snapped on in the middle section of the building.\r\nHe felt the gun in his pocket and walked to the edge of the circle of\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nFrescura was standing completely motionless behind a machine, his head\r\ninclined. He looked up abruptly as Talbot approached. “I knew you would\r\ncome back,” said Talbot.\r\n\r\n“I did,” acknowledged Frescura.\r\n\r\n“You lied this afternoon,” Talbot said. “Randy didn’t ‘accidentally’\r\ntouch the button which enabled you to hear what I was saying. She\r\nwasn’t there. You sent her away so that you could listen.”\r\n\r\nFrescura smiled and said nothing.\r\n\r\n“You figured out what I was going to recommend to Taft. But you wanted\r\nto be sure. Another thing, I didn’t slip. You knew from the beginning\r\nor you would never have thought of the fingerprint subterfuge. You had\r\nto be the one who rolled in the bomb.”\r\n\r\n“Of course,” said Frescura. “Soleri confided to only two people that he\r\nwas going to bring you in--myself and Randy. If Soleri had survived he\r\nwould have remembered that. Therefore I guessed the truth instantly. I\r\nknew what you were capable of. That’s why I tried to get rid of both\r\nyou, and Soleri.”\r\n\r\n“You must have sweated while I was in the hospital,” said Talbot. “It’s\r\na good thing Randy was watching over me.”\r\n\r\n“It was a good thing for you that I was nervous,” said Frescura.\r\n“Later, when you got well and didn’t say anything I knew exactly what\r\nhad happened. I thought I could handle you.”\r\n\r\n“That was your biggest mistake. I caused all sorts of trouble. But\r\nwhy did you have to get rid of anyone? Was it because you were close\r\nto success? Or because you wanted the discovery for yourself when the\r\ncompany failed?”\r\n\r\n“You’re still thinking in terms of money,” said Frescura. “There are\r\nthings of far greater importance. The discovery was mine. It was mine\r\nfrom the very beginning. I did all the fundamental work. After the\r\nfirst year I could have built a motor that would drive a ship near the\r\nspeed of light.”\r\n\r\nTalbot leaned back. “And you still asked for more money, pouring it\r\nendlessly into non-existent research? I’ll admit that you could have\r\nled us astray--if anybody could. But why?”\r\n\r\n“I wanted to be absolutely successful in establishing a conviction\r\nthat the motor could never be built,” said Frescura. “It was a\r\nproblem in business psychology. I bought shares in the largest\r\ncompany in existence. I had influence, and I persuaded them to spend\r\nimpossible sums under the direction of the foremost scientist in the\r\nfield--myself. If that combination couldn’t build the motor no one else\r\nwould ever try.”\r\n\r\n“What did you have to gain?” said Talbot.\r\n\r\n“Why don’t you ask me what I had to lose,” countered Frescura. “That\r\nengine would take us to the stars. Mankind isn’t ready for it.”\r\n\r\n“There’s something to what you say,” conceded Talbot. “Maybe we’re not\r\nready. I’m not a judge. But you’re a scientist. Nearly everyone in your\r\nfamily has been a distinguished scientist for generations. Surely _you_\r\nshould know that man is never fully ready for any new discovery.”\r\n\r\n“I am aware of my family’s collective guilt,” said Frescura. “But no\r\nFrescura will ever again be instrumental in leading mankind to the\r\nverge of destruction.”\r\n\r\n“That’s not an enlightening or entirely sane explanation,” said Talbot.\r\n\r\n“To you, perhaps not,” said Frescura. “To me it is. Both of my\r\ngrandfathers worked on the atom bomb. It has haunted us--”\r\n\r\nTalbot’s hand moved toward the gun in his pocket. “I see,” he said. “It\r\nmight haunt some people. However that disaster was prevented, just as\r\nyour insane little scheme will be. You’ve failed.”\r\n\r\n“You’re mistaken,” said Frescura. “This afternoon I knew you’d begin to\r\nsuspect me. I left deliberately, making sure you would see me go. But I\r\ncame back.”\r\n\r\n“So did I,” said Talbot. “You failed.”\r\n\r\n“I hardly think you’ll shoot me,” said Frescura.\r\n\r\n“I will if I have to. You left notes. Other men will make good use of\r\nthem now that they know you’ve been guilty of sabotage and murder.”\r\n\r\n“My notes will be quite useless to them,” said Frescura with a\r\nmelancholy smile. “I told you I was far ahead of everyone else in the\r\nfield.”\r\n\r\nThe gun came out of Talbot’s pocket. He was sweating. “There are times\r\nwhen everyone feels that the human race isn’t worth blowing to hell,”\r\nhe said. “You’ll feel differently after psychology. Let’s go.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t. My foot’s caught, and I’m in great pain. I turned on the\r\nlight to prevent you from plugging away at me in the darkness.” He was\r\nstaring intently at Talbot’s weapon. “I don’t have a gun. You will have\r\nto help me.”\r\n\r\nTalbot had no intention of moving any closer to Frescura’s powerful\r\narms. “You’ll have to free yourself,” he said. “Your foot will slip out\r\nof the shoe.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll try.” Frescura leaned on the machine and strained. His leg\r\nswung free. There was an odd rattling sound. Talbot glanced down--and\r\nfroze. Scores of black spheres were rolling across the floor in all\r\ndirections. Thermal capsules! Frescura had quite obviously been lying\r\nabout the injury to his leg. He had resorted to the subterfuge to\r\ndistract Talbot’s attention while he overturned a small box at the base\r\nof the machine with a swift carefully timed kick.\r\n\r\nTalbot glanced up. Frescura had leapt back into the shadows, and was\r\ncrouching behind the machines, his bulk only faintly visible in the dim\r\nlight.\r\n\r\n“Can you find all of them in this light--in the time you have left?” he\r\ntaunted. “What would you do with them if you succeeded?”\r\n\r\nTalbot raised his gun and sent a shot crashing into the shadows in the\r\ngeneral direction of the voice. As the dim subsided he called out, “The\r\nnext one will be you! Start toward the front.”\r\n\r\nThere was a mocking laugh from another direction. “I don’t think I\r\nwill. But you’d better hurry, Talbot.”\r\n\r\nHe didn’t stop to argue. The shop would be an inferno when the covering\r\nof the capsules disintegrated.\r\n\r\nThe shop was long, but it took him scarcely an instant to reach the\r\noffice building. The two structures were connected, but there was a\r\nmassive firewall between them. Talbot was thankful for the wall’s\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nAt the corridor near the outside entrance he tried to turn too quickly\r\nand went sprawling into a side passageway. He cursed the panic which\r\nhad caused him to stumble. It wasn’t entirely physical. His knees had\r\nsimply buckled and he couldn’t control his actions as he slammed into\r\nthe wall and fell. He was trying to get up when the thermal concussion\r\nhit him.\r\n\r\nThe superheated air expanded violently and hurled him flat again. In\r\nthe shop steel and concrete had been instantly vaporized near each\r\nsphere. But the firewall at the office held. It took up most of the\r\nshock before it crumbled, and the sprinklers switched on.\r\n\r\nTalbot became suddenly and violently ill. It was partly a nervous\r\nreaction, partly a physical one. The guard from the outside came by,\r\nrunning toward the explosion. He didn’t see Talbot lying stretched out\r\non the floor in the side corridor.\r\n\r\nTalbot staggered to his feet and went outside. He was still panic\r\nstricken; he ran.\r\n\r\nWhen finally he was out of breath and the fear and nausea had\r\ndiminished, he slowed down. He came to a rise in the street and looked\r\nback. The shop was a glowing mass of white hot steel and concrete.\r\nNow and then a capsule which had been timed for a different interval\r\nbelatedly let loose, sending up a shower of sparks. Frescura was dead.\r\n\r\nAttracted by the fire and explosion people were coming out on the\r\nstreet. It was dark and he was glad he couldn’t see their faces. He\r\ntried to make himself as inconspicuous as possible. He went by a group\r\nunder a street light. A little boy stopped in front of him, gazing up.\r\n\r\n“Mommy, what’s the matter with him?” shrieked the child, pointing to\r\nTalbot’s face.\r\n\r\nThe woman looked too. “Hush,” she said, jerking her son back. “You know\r\nit’s bad manners to point.”\r\n\r\n“But what’s the _matter_ with him?” persisted the child.\r\n\r\nTalbot walked on. His clothing was disheveled, but not burned. He felt\r\nlight-headed, unsteady on his feet. He was not surprised that the woman\r\nhad pulled the child away.\r\n\r\nHe had done his best. He had tried desperately to save Frescura from\r\nhis misplaced guilt feelings. Now he was going home to Randy. He had\r\nthought his return would be more triumphant than this.\r\n\r\nHe was nearing the apartment when he caught sight of himself in a shop\r\nmirror. He went past, then came back, and looked again. Finally he\r\nlooked away. Into his mind had washed a torrent of terror. His eyes\r\nseemed empty and hueless.\r\n\r\nHis cheeks sagged. His face was _Between_.\r\n\r\nHis empathy had been shattered by shock and fear. He could close the\r\ngulf between Soleri and himself because they had been very much alike\r\nto begin with. But Frescura was different, incomprehensible. He could\r\nnever have succeeded in understanding Frescura.\r\n\r\nHe had caught the last shreds of Frescura’s consciousness, and it was\r\nthat terrifying awareness which had sent him sprawling just before the\r\nconcussion. The obscure forces of his mind tried always to put him in\r\nanother’s place. In times of extreme mental reaction the force became\r\nmuch stronger. But it couldn’t span the emotional gulf between himself\r\nand the scientist.\r\n\r\nWhat it had done was to force out the lingering hold Soleri’s\r\npersonality still had on him. He was no longer Soleri. But by the same\r\ntoken he was not yet himself.\r\n\r\nHe was reverting.\r\n\r\nAnd his face was Between. It was a visible indication of what he was\r\nbecoming. He couldn’t ever hope to pass as Soleri again. And that meant\r\nthat Randy would be lost to him forever.\r\n\r\nHe turned and walked away from the apartment. His thoughts were dull\r\nand blank. He walked on until his body rebelled.\r\n\r\nHe stared about him. His wandering hadn’t been haphazard.\r\nSubconsciously his steps had taken him to his old apartment. He was\r\nstanding in front of the building where he had lived as Hal Talbot.\r\nWearily he climbed two flights of stairs and let himself in with a key\r\nwhich he had never discarded.\r\n\r\nHe fell on the bed. It was Talbot who went to sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the morning he avoided shaving. He didn’t want to look in the\r\nmirror. He ate, slept again, and listened to newscasts.\r\n\r\nThe newscaster announced that both Soleri and Frescura were dead.\r\nSoleri had been seen entering the plant but he hadn’t come out.\r\nFrescura’s death was harder to determine. He had left in the afternoon\r\nbut there were definite indications that he had returned to the main\r\nworkshop. The office building hadn’t been destroyed but the intense\r\nheat from the adjacent shop had caused considerable damage. A report\r\nhad been found indicating that Frescura had planned a final experiment.\r\nHe had been aware of the danger, and had planned to perform it at night\r\nin the workshop. An unexpected accident had apparently led to the\r\ntragedy.\r\n\r\nThe loss of building and equipment was partly covered by insurance. The\r\ncompany hastened to assure the public that there was sufficient capital\r\nin reserve to enable it to survive the blow to its financial stability.\r\n\r\nTalbot shut off the newscast. He might have liked Frescura. Except for\r\nhis excessive guilt complex the man had been heroic. And Talbot had to\r\nadmit that Frescura had been right in one detail. He hadn’t failed. The\r\nperfect rocket motor would never be fully constructed in this century.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, he had a problem. What did the future hold for him? He\r\nlunched frugally, and tried to control his agitation. In the middle of\r\nthe afternoon there was a knock on the door.\r\n\r\nRandy had found him. She came in quietly and looked around at the\r\nshabby little apartment.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t come to ask questions, although I have a right to,” she said.\r\n“But you made a mistake. Your salary allotment is on the executive\r\npayroll. It came to me for verification.”\r\n\r\n“You can’t prove anything,” he said. “And if you could--would it\r\nmatter?”\r\n\r\n“I can prove all I want to prove,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Soleri’s dead.”\r\n\r\n“I know,” she said. “I’ve known for a long time. That wasn’t the only\r\nmistake you made.”\r\n\r\n“You’ve known for a long time?” He sat down.\r\n\r\n“Since the night I took you home from the hospital--and stayed. You\r\nsaid the wrong things. You kept giving yourself away. Don’t forget I\r\nwas hired because I’m a psychologist.”\r\n\r\nShe stared at him steadily. “You told me that nothing had changed\r\nbetween us. But you were mistaken. I’m not in the habit of throwing\r\nmyself at men. I admit I did at Soleri, just a little. But he was not\r\nin love with me. He might have been--except that he was in love with\r\nEleanor.”\r\n\r\n“Why didn’t you tell someone?” Talbot said. “Take it to plant\r\nprotection?”\r\n\r\n“I couldn’t,” she said. “I was upset, but I had trapped myself. I\r\ncouldn’t--not until I figured things out. A few days later I decided\r\nnot to interfere. You told me that a man had been killed and that you\r\nintended to find out why. I knew that you were not responsible for what\r\nhad happened, that you were not just a self-seeking opportunist.”\r\n\r\nSo his masquerade hadn’t been nearly as good as he had thought!\r\nAt least two people had seen through it. “That arrangement you\r\nmentioned--your statement that you were going home early. Was that\r\ndeliberate too?”\r\n\r\n“I wanted more proof that you weren’t Soleri,” said Randy. “And--well,\r\nI wanted to see if you minded. I’m glad you did.”\r\n\r\nHis thoughts were whirling and he couldn’t look at her. Mechanically\r\nTalbot opened the envelope. There was more money in it for his three\r\nweeks of employment than he had earned in any previous three months.\r\n\r\n“When I put Talbot on the payroll I thought you were dead,” said Randy.\r\n“It was going to be your last job--so I made it a good one. I signed\r\nyou on as assistant to Soleri.”\r\n\r\nHe could do without that. He didn’t need any industrial “assists” apart\r\nfrom himself, and his training in transportation and electronics.\r\n\r\n“Taft is hoping you’ll show up,” said Randy. “His two top men are gone.\r\nHe needs a new executive familiar with the organization. The company\r\nwill still do research, on a dozen new projects. It has to keep on\r\nwith experimental work if it’s going to survive.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks for the tip!” He grinned at her. “I might go down and see what\r\nposition they have for a man of my ability. You’d like that, wouldn’t\r\nyou?”\r\n\r\nHe crossed the room and looked down at her. “But you’ve got to\r\nunderstand this--there are some things for which I can’t be any man’s\r\nassistant.”\r\n\r\n“You won’t be,” said Randy.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you know you never were?”\r\n\r\nHe knew it now. It was good to be himself again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber’s Note:\r\n\r\n\r\nThis etext was produced from Fantastic Universe, March 1956 (Vol. 5,\r\nNo. 2.).
