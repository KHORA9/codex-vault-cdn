I\r\nwould like to know if angle-worms damage corn.\r\n\r\nEight years ago I came to the conclusion that I could raise double the\r\nnumber of bushels of corn that I was then raising. I then commenced\r\nexperimenting on a small scale. I succeeded very well for the first\r\nthree or four years. I got so that I could raise over ninety bushels per\r\nacre. In one year I got a few pounds over 100 bushels per acre. Three\r\nyears ago my crop began to fail, and has continued to fail up to the\r\npresent year, with the same treatment. Last year it was so bad that I\r\nconcluded to examine the roots of the corn plants. I found both\r\nangle-worms and grubs in the roots. This year I went into a thorough\r\nexamination and found nothing there but angle-worms, with a wonderful\r\nincrease. They were right at the end of the stalk where the roots were\r\nthick, but the worms thicker.\r\n\r\nThe corn at first seems to do very well, but long before the grain gets\r\nripe the leaves begin to get dry and the stalks commence falling. The\r\nconsequence is that over one-half the corn is loose on the cob and the\r\nears very short. I am entirely headed in the corn line. Is it the\r\nangle-worms? If so, what is the remedy? I plant my corn every year on\r\nthe same ground. I allow no weeds to grow in my cornfield. Farmers can\r\nnot afford to raise weeds. I remove all weeds and put corn in their\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nI have plowed my land for the next year's crop of corn and put on twenty\r\nloads of manure to the acre and plowed it under. I have no faith in\r\nplanting the ground next year unless I can destroy the worms that I call\r\nangle-worms. I have consulted several of my brother farmers, and they\r\nsay that the angle-worms never destroy a crop of corn.\r\n\r\nI thought last year that my seed corn was poor and run out, so I went to\r\nChicago and got Sibley's \"Pride of the North,\" but that was no better.\r\n\r\nIf you will kindly inform me how to remedy this looseness of the kernel\r\nI will agree to show you how 100 bushels of corn can be raised on one\r\nacre every good corn year.\r\n\r\n    HORACE HOPKINS.\r\n        DESPLAINES, ILL., Jan. 2.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe sent this communication to Professor Forbes, State Entomologist and\r\nreceived the following reply:\r\n\r\nEDITOR PRAIRIE FARMER--There can be hardly a shadow of a doubt that the\r\ninjury which your correspondent so graphically describes is due to the\r\ncorn root-worm (Diabrotica longicornis), a full account of which will be\r\nfound in my report for 1882, published last November.\r\n\r\nThe clue to his whole difficulty lies in the sentence, \"I plant my corn\r\nevery year on the same ground.\" As the beetles from which the root-worms\r\ndescend lay their eggs in corn fields in autumn, and as these eggs do\r\nnot hatch until after corn planting in the following spring, a simple\r\nchange of crops for a single year, inevitably starves the entire\r\ngeneration to death in the ground.\r\n\r\nI inclose a slip, giving a brief account of this most grievous pest; but\r\nthe article in my last report already referred to will be found more\r\nsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n    S. A. FORBES.\r\n        NORMAL, ILL., January 3.\r\n\r\nP.S.--You will probably remember that I published a paper on this insect\r\nin THE PRAIRIE FARMER for December 30, 1882.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following is the description referred to:\r\n\r\n_From the \"Crop Report\" for 1882._\r\n\r\n\"The corn-root worm, in the form in which it affects the roots of corn,\r\nis a slender white grub, not thicker than a pin, from one fourth to\r\nthree-eighths of an inch in length, with a small brown head, and six\r\nvery short legs. It commences its attack in May or June, usually at some\r\ndistance from the stalk, towards which it eats its way beneath the\r\nepidermis, killing the root as fast as it proceeds. Late in July or\r\nearly in August it transforms in the ground near the base of the hill,\r\nchanging into a white pupa, about fifteen-hundredths of an inch long and\r\ntwo-thirds that width, looking somewhat like an adult beetle, but with\r\nthe wings and wing-covers rudimentary, and with the legs closely drawn\r\nup against the body. A few days later it emerges as a perfect insect,\r\nabout one-fifth of an inch in length, varying in color from pale\r\ngreenish-brown to bright grass-green, and usually without spots or\r\nmarkings of any kind. The beetle climbs up the stalk, living on fallen\r\npollen and upon the silk at the tip of the ear until the latter dies,\r\nwhen a few of the beetles creep down between the husks, and feed upon\r\nthe corn itself, while others resort for food to the pollen of such\r\nweeds in the field as are at that time in blossom. In September and\r\nOctober the eggs are laid in the ground upon or about the roots of the\r\ncorn, and most of the beetles soon after disappear from the field. They\r\nmay ordinarily be found upon the late blooming plants, feeding as usual\r\nupon the pollen of the flowers, and also to some extent upon molds and\r\nother fungi, and upon decaying vegetation. There can be no further doubt\r\nthat the insect is single-brooded, that it hibernates in the egg as a\r\nrule, and that this does not hatch until after the ground has been\r\nplowed and planted to corn in the spring probably in May or June.\r\n\r\n\"Although the adult beetles, when numerous, do some harm by eating the\r\nsilk before the kernels are fertilized by the pollen, and also destroy\r\noccasionally a few kernels in the tip of the ear, yet the principal\r\ninjury is done by the larva in its attack upon the roots. The extent of\r\nthis injury depends not only upon the number of the worms, but also upon\r\nthe soil and weather and the general condition of the crop, being worst\r\non high land and in dry weather. Under specially unfavorable\r\ncircumstances the loss due to the insect may amount to from one-fourth\r\nto one-half or even three-fourths of the crop; but when the conditions\r\nare generally favorable, it rarely amounts to more than ten or twenty\r\nper cent, and frequently even to less. Although the roots penetrated by\r\nthe larvæ die and decay, thrifty corn will throw out new ones to replace\r\nthose lost. The hold of the stalk upon the ground is often so weakened\r\nthat a slight wind is sufficient to prostrate the corn. Under these\r\ncircumstances it will often throw out new roots from the joints above\r\nthe ground, thus rallying to a certain extent against serious injury.\r\n\r\n\"As the result of numerous observations and comparisons, it is clearly\r\nto be seen that little or no mischief is done except in fields that have\r\nbeen in corn during the year or two preceding, and a frequent change of\r\ncrops is therefore a complete preventive. Beyond this, the life history\r\nof the insect gives us little hope of fighting it effectually except at\r\ntoo great expense, as the eggs and worms are scattered and hidden in the\r\nground, and the perfect beetle is widely dispersed throughout the\r\nfield.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCalifornia has about eighty thousand tons of wheat to ship to Europe.\r\nBesides this a large amount is already stowed in ships.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPATRICK BARRY.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Patrick Barry]\r\n\r\n\r\nOur portrait this week is of Patrick Barry, Esq., the noted nurseryman\r\nand horticulturist of Rochester, N. Y. Mr. Barry was born near Belfast,\r\nIreland, in 1816. His father was a small farmer, but he gave the boy a\r\ngood education, and at eighteen he was appointed to teach in one of the\r\nnational schools. At the age of twenty he resigned this position, and\r\ncame to America, where he began clerking in the Linnæan nurseries, at\r\nFlushing, L. I. During his stay of four years here he mastered the\r\nprinciples of the nursery business. In 1840 he moved to Rochester, and\r\nforming a partnership with Mr. Ellwanger, started the famous Mount Hope\r\nNurseries. They began on a tract of but seven acres. In 1852 he issued\r\nthe \"Fruit Garden,\" which is to this day a standard work among\r\nhorticulturists. Previous to this he had written largely for the\r\nagricultural and horticultural press. In 1852 he also began editing the\r\nHorticulturist, then owned by Mr. James Vick. Mr. Barry's second great\r\nwork, and the one involving most time and labor was the Catalogue of the\r\nAmerican Pomological Society.\r\n\r\nMr. Barry has long been President of the Western New York Horticultural\r\nSociety. He is also a member of the Board of Control of the New York\r\nExperiment Station. He has served several terms in the city council of\r\nRochester and in the Board of Supervisors of the country. Mr. Barry is\r\nan active business man and besides his great labor in conducting the\r\nnursery affairs, he discharges the duties of President of many corporate\r\nenterprises in which he has large financial interests. Mr. Barry was\r\nhappily married in 1847, and the amiable sharer of his hardships and his\r\nsuccesses is still living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPILED CORRESPONDENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nHANCOCK CO., Dec. 31.--Weather very disagreeable; snow six inches deep,\r\nand from rain and sleet and thaw and freeze, has formed a hard crust, so\r\nas to make bad traveling--in the roads icy and slippery. To-day cloudy,\r\ndamp and cool. A few days ago the mercury reached 8 degrees below zero,\r\nthe lowest of the season. It is very hard on stock, and many of the\r\ncattle are without shelter, as usual. Accept New Year greetings for all\r\nTHE PRAIRIE FARMER family. L. T.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMILLS CO., MO., Jan. 8.--Since the first of January we have had hard\r\nwinter weather. An old weather prophet says we are to have just such\r\nweather for forty days. I sincerely hope not. On Friday night, January\r\n4th and 5th, all the thermometers commonly used by farmers went clear\r\ndown out of sight. As they only mark about 30 degrees below zero it was\r\nuncertain how cold it really was. Unsheltered stock suffered terribly. A\r\nfew farmers were caught without wood, and suffered from the storm in\r\nsecuring a supply. We have had five days of snow so that there is a\r\nheavy coat all over. A. J. L.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nST. LOUIS, MO., January 13.--Advices from Mobile say the late cold snap\r\ncaused immense damage in that section. The loss to the orange groves is\r\nestimated at nearly a $1,000,000, and the value of vegetables killed in\r\nMobile county alone will reach the same sum. Great damage was also done\r\nto orange groves in Florida, but many orange growers profited by the\r\nSignal Service warning and built fires in their groves, and thus saved\r\ntheir trees. News from the Michigan peach belt is that the fruits are\r\nuninjured.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nStrawberries are sold in New York city at fifteen cents each.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURAL\r\n\r\nFarmers, Write for Your Paper.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllinois Tile-Makers.\r\n\r\nThe Illinois State Tile-Makers' Convention at Springfield, last week,\r\nwas more largely attended than in any previous year since the\r\nassociation was formed. Nearly one hundred joined the association.\r\n\r\nThe convention was welcomed to the city by Governor Hamilton in an\r\nappropriate address in which he expressed his deep sympathy with and\r\ninterest in all the manufacturing enterprises that are giving employment\r\nto the people and adding wealth to the State. He announced himself as in\r\nfavor of protection and encouragement to the manufacturing interests. He\r\nthought the tile men were greatly adding to the wealth and\r\nproductiveness of Illinois, and that they were also indirectly improving\r\nthe health of the people.\r\n\r\nThe President's address was brief but full of information and good\r\nsense. He pointed out at length the improvements in tile kilns, and in\r\nvarious appliances, which have been made in recent years, and declared\r\nthat valuable as these all are, they can not make up for the lack of\r\nskill and experience. He believed the increased interest in terra cotta,\r\nand in useful ornamental and out tiling points to the great source of\r\nsupply as the timber of the country decreases in quantity. The\r\ndrain-tile manufacture was simply the beginning of an era of skillful\r\nclay working, which would not only add greatly to the fertility of the\r\nsoil, but to the means of the beauty and endurance in numerous forms of\r\nbuilding. Of the statistics of the business, he said the latest\r\ninformation is that there are in the State 600 factories, built at an\r\naverage cost of $3,000 each, employing about 5,400 men seven months each\r\nyear, who receive about $250,000 and their board. The total annual\r\ncapacity of these factories he estimates at 56,100 miles annually. He\r\nestimates the amount invested in the industry, including the value of\r\ntile already laid, at $5,000,000, and the increased value of land\r\ndrained at $10,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary's report gave the general condition of the society. In\r\n1879 it was composed of forty-five members; in 1880, of thirty-five; in\r\n1881, of twenty-eight; in 1882, fifty-three; in 1883, of eighty-three,\r\nand in 1884, of eighty-six. The first meetings of the association were\r\nnecessarily crude, the programme having been prepared after the\r\nassociation met. Now, however, they were in working harness, and met\r\nwith a regularly prepared programme. The proceedings of the meetings and\r\na summary of the papers read and discussed, are now published in the\r\nreport of the State Board of Agriculture.\r\n\r\nThe treasurer, John McCabe, Esq., of Rushville, made his report of which\r\nthe following is the summary:\r\n\r\nAmount on hand at last report                  $29 35\r\nReceived from members last year                 82 00\r\n                                              -------\r\n                                              $111 35\r\nPaid out last year                              87 50\r\n                                              -------\r\n    Balance in the treasury                   $ 23 85\r\n\r\nThese reports were followed by an essay by Mr. C. G. Elliott, which is\r\nof so much merit that we give it in full deferring a further report of\r\nproceedings until next week.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMISTAKES IN DRAINAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo speak of our successes rather than our mistakes, is far more\r\nagreeable to ourselves and also to others. We all take pride in giving\r\nour experience in any work when we have been successful, but our errors\r\nand mistakes we often carefully hide from public gaze. The transactions\r\nof our industrial conventions are largely made up of the successful\r\nparts of the experiences of members. Our tile manufacturers fail to\r\nspeak of their losses in correcting mistakes the number of kilns they\r\nhave rebuilt, the number of tile they weekly commit to the waste pile,\r\nthe percentage of good and poor tile in each kiln, and many other things\r\nthat your humble servant will probably never suspect until he attempts\r\nto manufacture tile.\r\n\r\nA similar statement may be made with reference to drainage mistakes. How\r\nmany dry weather drains do we hear mentioned in our conventions, or see\r\ndescribed in our newspapers. By such drains, I mean those which in\r\nfavorable seasons so operate as to permit the land to produce a heavy\r\ncrop--one worth publishing--while in wet years, merely a total loss\r\nresults. Cases of such drainage can be numbered by the score. How many\r\nmiles of drain tile have been taken up and relaid during the past year\r\nbecause of some mistake in plan, size of tile, or execution of the work?\r\nMuch might be said of drainage mistakes in a general way, but it is\r\nproposed in this paper to treat the subject in a specific and practical\r\nmanner. It may be encouraging to remember that it is only by comparing\r\nsuccess with mistakes that we make progress in any valuable science or\r\nart. Great skill and success rest upon a foundation of corrected\r\nmistakes.\r\n\r\n\r\nMISTAKE NO. 1--LACK OF INFORMATION ON DRAINAGE.\r\n\r\nWe might more properly call this the cause of many mistakes. \"Knowledge\r\nis power,\" says the old adage, and we might add that knowledge in\r\ndrainage is success. This knowledge may be obtained in three ways:\r\nFirst, from reliable books; second, by inquiring of others who have had\r\nexperience; third, by our own experience. The first is of prime\r\nimportance to the beginner, for in books are found statements of the\r\ngeneral principles and philosophy of drainage, together with the best\r\nmethods and practice known. The second is often unreliable, for the\r\nreason that the error of one is often copied by another and becomes wide\r\nspread before it is detected. The third, though valuable is costly, and\r\ndiscouraging to the learner. Gleanings from all of these sources will,\r\nperhaps, give the most complete satisfaction.\r\n\r\nTile drainage began to be practiced in my own neighborhood about seven\r\nyears ago. Those who were about to begin knew nothing about drainage,\r\nexcept from hearsay knowledge that had crept into the community. Not a\r\nsingle book upon the subject was consulted or even inquired for. Even\r\nnow they are as rare in farmers libraries as the classic poets. Farmer\r\nA. wished to drain and consulted farmer B., who had put in some tile the\r\nyear before. Did he think it paid? Yes. What kind of tile did he use and\r\nhow was the work done? So A. planned and did his work in accordance with\r\ninformation obtained from B. Neighbor C. followed A., and so the work\r\nspread. It is now found that mistakes were made in the beginning which\r\nwere handed from one to the other, until now, no alternative remains but\r\nto remove the whole work, and no little trouble and expense. This case\r\nis but one out of many which might be stated illustrating the lack of\r\ninformation at the beginning of drainage work. My observation upon this\r\npoint has been that those have availed themselves of information given\r\nin books and papers upon drainage matters made fewer mistakes and did\r\nbetter work than those who relied upon the general wave of progress to\r\npush them along in the footsteps of their nearest neighbor. The theory,\r\nas well as the art, of drainage should be studied, and all knowledge\r\nadapted to the peculiarities of each case.\r\n\r\n\r\nMISTAKE NO. 2--NOT PLANNING FOR FUTURE DRAINAGE.\r\n\r\nA mistake often made by the novice is, that at first, drains are located\r\nwithout reference to the future drainage of other parts of the farm.\r\nDrains are put in as experiments, very much as we would plant a new\r\nvariety of fruit or grain, expecting that probably the chances are\r\nagainst their success. Subsequently, when plans for more extended\r\ndrainage are made, the drains already in operation were found to poorly\r\nserve the desired purpose.\r\n\r\nIn order to guard against this mistake, have faith in drainage. Put it\r\ndown on the whitest page of your memorandum, and with your best pen and\r\nink, that drainage will pay, and the fewer mistakes made about it the\r\nbetter it will pay. Put it down that the time will come when you will\r\ndrain all of your wet land, and make your plans accordingly. Many times\r\nhave I heard this objection to locating a drain so as to benefit a\r\ncertain field, \"O no; I'll never drain that field. It's all right as it\r\nis. If I can only get this wet over here dry I shall be satisfied.\" In\r\ntwo years this same farmer was planning how he could drain the rejected\r\nfield, and regretting that he had not made provision for it from the\r\nbeginning. I have in mind several miles of tile that will be taken up\r\nduring the coming season and relaid with reference to the drainage of\r\nall land having a natural slope in that direction.\r\n\r\n\r\nMISTAKE NO. 3--NOT BEGINNING AT THE RIGHT PLACE.\r\n\r\nMany of the drains first put in are at the head of the water shed\r\ninstead of at the lower part or outlet. They discharge improperly and\r\nfail to fit into a more thorough system, where plans for better drainage\r\nare laid out.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this error, begin at the outlet and work with reference to\r\nultimately draining the whole section naturally sloping toward this\r\noutlet. If a surface ditch is necessary, make it. If tile can be used,\r\nlay them, even if only a fraction of the entire work is done each year.\r\nDrain laterally toward the main as it is carried upward. The outlay at\r\nfirst, rod for rod, will be greater, but the final cost will be less,\r\nand yearly profits greater.\r\n\r\nI have in mind several cases of unsatisfactory drainage growing out of a\r\ndesire to avoid difficulty and expense in making a sufficient outlet.\r\nAmong them may be named the following: Putting a drain across one side\r\nof a pond because sufficient depth can not be had to admit of its being\r\nrun through the center. Placing drains each side of a slough, parallel\r\nto its center line, leaving the center undrained. Draining cultivated\r\nfields and allowing the water to discharge upon land occupying a lower\r\nlevel. All of these are make-shifts for the purpose of avoiding the\r\nexpense of a good outlet.\r\n\r\nThere is in this connection a difficulty which can not be overlooked,\r\none which is beyond the control of the individual farmer, and that is,\r\nwhen the drainage section is owned by two or more parties. The\r\nadjustment of such cases has occupied the attention of our legislators,\r\nand some progress has been made in framing laws to meet the case, yet\r\nmany difficulties remain unprovided for. If all parties agree to accept\r\nsuch awards and assessments as a commission may make, then the matter of\r\ndrainage outlets can be satisfactorily adjusted, but if any party is\r\ndisposed to resist, the desired drainage can be practically defeated. I\r\nmay, at present, be justified in saying that where only a few neighbors\r\nare concerned, it is a mistake to attempt to use the law at all. Arrange\r\nthe matter by mutual agreement or by leaving it to disinterested men to\r\ndecide.\r\n\r\n\r\nMISTAKE NO. 4--TOO SMALL TILE.\r\n\r\nNo mistake has become apparent sooner than this. The following\r\nobservations will account for this, and also aid in correcting it. The\r\nwhole area of land which naturally discharges toward the drain is not\r\nalways taken into account. It is generally thought that land lying at\r\nsome distance from the drain, though sloping toward it, does not affect\r\nthe capacity required for the drain, whereas in times of heavy rains,\r\nwhen drains are taxed to their utmost, water flows from those more\r\ndistant parts over the surface to the ground acted upon by the tile\r\ndrain. We must then provide for the drainage not only of land contiguous\r\nto the drains but for an additional amount of water coming from\r\nadjoining slopes.\r\n\r\nAnother popular error is that the diameter of the tile is the measure of\r\nits capacity, whereas the grade upon which it is laid is as important as\r\nthe size of the tile. The extreme porosity of many of our soils, and the\r\nlack of thorough lateral drainage is another thing by reason of which\r\nmain drains become over-taxed, simply because drainage water is not held\r\nin check by close soils, or distributed by lateral drains, but is\r\nbrought in large quantities over the surface to the drain line, and must\r\nbe taken away in a short time or injury is done to the land. In making\r\nmains or sub-mains it is better to err in making them too large than too\r\nsmall.\r\n\r\n\r\nMISTAKE NO. 5--NOT LATERAL ENOUGH.\r\n\r\nWe expect too much from a single line of tile. We often see a line of\r\ntile put through a fifteen or twenty acre field with the expectation\r\nthat the field will be drained, and thanks to our tractable soil, and\r\nthe magic influence of tile, a great work is done for the field. It is,\r\nhowever, the dry weather drains previously alluded to. Put in the\r\nlateral drains so that the whole flat will come under the direct\r\ninfluence of tile, and you will have a garden spot instead of a field\r\nperiodically flooded. Your sleep will not then be disturbed by fears\r\nthat the morning will reveal your tiled field covered with water, and\r\nyour corn crop on the verge of ruin. We often see a single line laid\r\nthrough a pond containing from one half to three acres. Ponds with such\r\ndrainage always get flooded. Put in an abundance of laterals and the\r\ndifficulty is overcome.\r\n\r\nI am glad to say that the tendency now among farmers who have practiced\r\nrandom drainage is toward more thorough work in this direction. The loss\r\nof an occasional crop soon demonstrates in favor of more thorough work.\r\n\r\n\r\nMISTAKE NO. 6--INATTENTION TO DETAILS.\r\n\r\nFarmers have been too much under the rule of professional ditchers.\r\nHaving no well defined ideas of good drainage work, they have left the\r\nmatter largely to the judgment, or rather the cupidity of the ditcher\r\nand the layer. There are many first-class, conscientious workmen, but it\r\nis to be regretted that the average ditcher does work far below the\r\nstandard of excellence. If by some magic means the conditions of many of\r\nthe drains in our State could be spread out before us in open view, it\r\nwould be a wonder to this convention that tile drainage has wrought out\r\nsuch favorable results as it has. We would see tile laid on the siphon\r\nplan, good and poor joints, faulty connections, ditches crooked enough\r\nto baffle the sagacious mole should he attempt to follow the line.\r\nPatience would scarcely hold out to enumerate the exasperating defects\r\nof much of our drainage work. Nothing can overcome the egotism and\r\nself-confidence of the average ditcher except the constant supervision\r\nof the employer. Such work is so soon covered, and errors placed beyond\r\nimmediate detection that nothing else will suffice. To guard against\r\nsuch mistakes, know what work you want and how you want it done, and\r\nthen look after it yourself or employ some one in whom you have\r\nconfidence to superintend it. When any mistake is guarded against, from\r\nbeginning to end, the work will not be too well done. The cut-and-cover,\r\nhurry-scurry methods of doing things, common on some Western farms, will\r\nnot do in drainage work. Carefulness in regard to every detail is the\r\nonly safe rule to adopt.\r\n\r\n\r\nMISTAKE NO. 7--FAILURE TO MAKE OPEN DITCHES FOR WATER COURSES.\r\n\r\nThe farmers of Illinois have, in many sections, been avoiding the main\r\nquestion in the drainage of our rich prairies, and that is the\r\nimprovement of the natural water courses so that they will carry off the\r\ndrainage water of sections for which they afford outlets. Every feasible\r\nplan and device has been used to circumvent the forces of nature and\r\nrelieve valuable farm lands from surplus water. In the flat sections of\r\nour State nothing will serve this purpose but the deepening of our large\r\nsloughs by constructing capacious open ditches. Our land can not be\r\nproperly drained without them. They must be of ample depth and width,\r\nand well made in every respect. No problem connected with the drainage\r\ninterests of our State should, at present, receive more careful\r\nattention than this. Nature, has, in most cases, marked out the line for\r\nwork, and says, \"let man enlarge and complete for his undivided use\r\naccording to his strength and skill.\" When such work is done, the demand\r\nfor tile to supplement the drainage thus made possible will be\r\nunprecedented. The drainage of our roads will be facilitated, and the\r\ngreatest difficulty thus far encountered in the drainage of our flat\r\nprairies will be overcome. Much has been attempted in this direction in\r\nsome portions of the State, but many open ditches are too shallow, too\r\nsmall, and too carelessly made to serve the desired purpose.\r\n\r\nIn pointing out some of the mistakes made in drainage, I am well aware\r\nthat there are differences of opinion as to what may be properly\r\nconsidered a mistake. The aim of drainage is to fit the wet land of the\r\nentire farm for the successful cultivation of all the field crops at the\r\nleast expense consistent with thoroughness. Now, if experiments must be\r\ntried by tiling here and there, and afterward take the tile up and\r\nremold the whole work, there is a loss which, were it not for the large\r\nprofit resulting from the use of tile, would be disastrous.\r\n\r\nShould a Board of Public Works build several bridges of insufficient\r\ncapacity in order to find out the necessary dimensions and strength of\r\none which will serve their purpose, we should at once regard them\r\nincompetent and wasteful. I know of tile which have been taken up at\r\nthree different times, larger tile being used each time. This farmer\r\ndiscards the use of lateral drains and rests his success upon single\r\nlines of large tile. He will probably be disappointed in this and,\r\nperhaps, finally hit upon the correct method. Would it not have been the\r\npart of wisdom to have obtained some reliable information upon that\r\nmatter at first from books, from inquiring of others of longer\r\nexperience, from a competent engineer, or from all of these sources?\r\nAnything which needlessly adds to the expense, or detracts from the\r\nefficiency of the work, should be regarded as a mistake.\r\n\r\nAs a summary of what has been said regarding mistakes and how to avoid\r\nthem, I append here a few\r\n\r\n\r\nDRAINAGE MAXIMS.\r\n\r\n1. Become informed upon the theory and best methods known and used.\r\n\r\n2. Do not literally copy the methods of others, but carefully adapt them\r\nto your own case.\r\n\r\n3. Provide good outlets and large mains.\r\n\r\n4. Have faith in good tile and thorough work.\r\n\r\n5. Study economy and efficiency in locating drains.\r\n\r\n6. In difficult cases, or where you have doubt about the success of your\r\nplans, submit the case to a good engineer before expending money or\r\nlabor.\r\n\r\n7. Employ good help by the day, and work it under a competent\r\nsuperintendent, rather than job out the work by the rod.\r\n\r\n8. Drain as you would plant fruit trees--for the future as well as the\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nI have been prosy and practical enough and now have used my allotted\r\ntime and space. It may not be wholly out of place to further tax your\r\ntime and patience, and ask you to lift your eyes from taking a critical\r\nview of defective drains, muddy ditches, and unattractive detail work,\r\nand look at the result of careful and thorough labor. As the years come\r\nand go with their changing seasons, your drained fields are ever your\r\nfriends, always cheering you with a bountiful harvest, always answering\r\nto every industrious touch you may bestow upon them. \"No excellence\r\nwithout labor,\" says the scholar to the discouraged student. \"No\r\nexcellence without labor,\" says the soil to the farmer, as he drains and\r\nplows and digs, and so we all learn that success in dealing with nature\r\nis brought about by thorough and honest work.\r\n\r\nOur enthusiasm scarcely knows bounds when we see that by our drainage\r\nwork the apparently obstinate soil is made to reflect the sunlight from\r\na covering of golden grain; when gardens and orchards bloom and yield\r\nfruit where once the willows dipped their drooping branches in the slimy\r\nfluid below, and frogs regaled the passer-by with their festive songs.\r\nRoses now twine over the rural cottage and send their fragrance into the\r\nwholesome air, where once the beaver reared his rude dwelling, and\r\ndisease lurked in every breath, ready to seize his unsuspecting victim.\r\n\r\nThink you that these changes can be wrought without earnest and careful\r\neffort? I have but little sympathy with the glittering generalities and\r\nhighly colored pictures of success in industrial pursuits, held before\r\nthe public gaze by unpractical but well meaning public teachers. We need\r\nthe dissemination of ideas of thoroughness and the knowledge necessary\r\nto put those ideas into practical use in order that the farmers of\r\nIllinois may make the fewest possible mistakes in drainage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFARMERS ADVICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nFarmers get plenty of advice. Were we able to work as easy and as well\r\nas the advice generally given to us would seem to indicate we could how\r\neasy and independent our occupation would become. In no other line of\r\nbusiness is advice so freely given, and so much blame attached because\r\nthe advice is not followed.\r\n\r\nThe great trouble is that nearly everybody imagines they know how to\r\nfarm. Although these same people may never have been practical farmers,\r\nthey yet seem to think that anybody can farm, and, of course, they know\r\nas much about it as any one, and can tell at least how it ought to be\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nTheoretical farming is always very fine--more so than any other calling.\r\nVery few believe in theory in other branches in business. As a rule, to\r\nbe successful in other occupations, a long training is necessary; step\r\nby step must one go until each detail is learned. And it is only by\r\nindustry, experience, and hard work that these are fully mastered.\r\nAdvice is offered sparingly, because it is known that experience is the\r\nonly true guide. But in farming theories are supposed to take the place\r\nof experience, and men who have very little, if any, practical knowledge\r\ncan tell us how to farm. The fact is there is hardly a business or\r\noccupation that practically requires more study and experience than\r\nfarming. A practical farmer, who makes his farm and farm work a study,\r\nlearns something every day, and unless he is willing to learn not only\r\nby his own experience, but by that of others, he will soon discover that\r\nhe is falling behind.\r\n\r\nSuch a man is able to discriminate between the practical experience of\r\none and the theory of the other. If new plans or new methods are\r\npresented, he can, in some degree, judge whether they are in any way\r\npractical, and if they are, he is willing to give them a trial. He knows\r\nthat what might prove just the right thing to plant in one section of\r\ncountry, under certain conditions, and in some soils would, under a\r\ndifferent climate and soil, result far from satisfactory. The large per\r\ncent of this kind of real practical knowledge can only be gained by\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nWhenever we meet a man who will not learn, we can not help but conclude\r\nthat he will never make a successful farmer. We want to learn, too, not\r\nonly by our successes, but by our failures. If we try a new plan and\r\nfail, we want to be able to know why we failed--just as much as to know\r\nwhy we succeeded.\r\n\r\nOne great trouble with us in learning is that we are too apt to keep in\r\nmind our successes and forget the failures. This is the great fault of\r\ntheoretical farming. If by a combination of favorable conditions success\r\nis obtained, it is given out as a fact--no exception being given or\r\nallowed for the very favorable conditions under which the method was\r\ntried. Such things may rightly be compared to the many specifics given\r\nto cure the various ills of life. A remedy is tried which, under\r\nfavorable conditions, effects a cure, and forthwith the cure is given\r\nout as a specific. Others, with the same complaint but under different\r\nconditions, try the same remedy and fail to receive the least benefit.\r\nNo mention is made of these failures, and, of course, others are induced\r\nto give the remedy a trial. For this reason it is always interesting to\r\nhear of failures as well as successes, provided the real cause can be\r\nstated.\r\n\r\n    MILLER CO., MO.\r\n        N. J. SHEPHERD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCISTERNS ON THE FARM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is hardly any one thing on a well-regulated farm so much needed as\r\na cistern near the kitchen door, so the farmer's wife will have to go\r\nbut a little distance for water, and no man knows how much is used in a\r\nfarmer's kitchen, unless he carries it for his wife for six months or a\r\nyear, and if he has to carry it a hundred yards or so from the spring,\r\nhe will wonder what in the world his wife does with so much water.\r\n\r\nThe cistern should be a large one and hold not less than 200 barrels,\r\nand well built, that is, walled up with brick and scientifically\r\nplastered. All of the pipes from the roof should lead into one hopper,\r\nand one pipe leading from the bottom of the hopper (under ground is the\r\nbest) into the cistern. In the bottom of the hopper should be fitted a\r\npiece of woven wire, which can be readily taken out and put in again;\r\nthe meshes of the wire should not be larger than one-eighth of an inch.\r\nThis piece of woven wire should never be in its place except when water\r\nis running into the cistern, when it will serve as a strainer to keep\r\nleaves or trash of any kind from running into the cistern. A waste-water\r\npipe should be attached to the down pipe (all of the down pipes should\r\nlead into one) which leads into the hopper, to waste all the water that\r\ncomes from the roof until the water is perfectly clear and free from\r\nleaves or trash of any kind; then the waste-water pipe should be taken\r\noff and a pipe of proper length slipped onto the down pipe conducting\r\nthe water, pure and clean, into the hopper. But before letting the water\r\ninto the hopper, the piece of woven wire should be put in its place in\r\nthe bottom of the hopper, and after the rain is over it should be taken\r\nout and hung up in a dry place until wanted again, and the waste-water\r\npipe put on. If the piece of woven wire is left in the hopper the meshes\r\nwill get filled up, and the hopper will fill with leaves and trash of\r\nall kinds and run over, and no water get into the cistern--and if it\r\ndoes it will not be pure. By this arrangement only pure water will run\r\ninto the cistern; but even then it ought to be cleaned out very fall or\r\nearly in the spring. Farmers will find a cistern in their house lots or\r\ninside the barn a great convenience--but the one near the kitchen is of\r\nthe greatest importance because the men will not carry water if they can\r\nhelp it, and the farmer's wife, if she has any spunk, will insist upon\r\nthe water being carried for her or raise the roof off the house, and I\r\ndon't blame her--the hair on the top of my head is very thin--and\r\nscarce.\r\n\r\n    HIKE'S POINT, KY.\r\n        E. F. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIELD AND FURROW.\r\n\r\n\r\nMass. Ploughman: Farm accounts, even when kept in the most simple form,\r\nnot only afford great satisfaction, but they do much to aid the farmer\r\nin his efforts to success. If at the end of the season he is able to\r\nstrike the balance, and thus learn the cost of his principal crops, he\r\nis in a position to correctly judge what crops will promise the most\r\nprofit another year.\r\n\r\nThe Farm Economist has this to say in regard to marketing corn. While it\r\nis contrary to general opinion, it is nevertheless true, as facts and\r\nfigures are capable of proving: \"Farmers in discussing their declining\r\nmarkets should remember that every bushel of corn sold in the form of\r\nwhisky cuts off the sale of ten bushels in the form of meat. It might be\r\nwell to consider this in discussing how the market for farm products can\r\nbe improved.\" This same paper further remarks, \"Where's the sense in a\r\nfarmer growling because he is not represented in the government when he\r\nwon't go to a convention and see that he is represented. Quit your\r\ngrowling and do your duty. One good vote in the primaries or in the\r\nconvention is worth 1,757,362 growls afterward.\"\r\n\r\nThe Wisconsin Tobacco Reporter states that the new phase to the Sumatra\r\nquestion has brought out considerable discussion among dealers in the\r\nEdgerton market and that the prevailing impression appears to be that\r\neven if the recent decision be upheld, under the jugglery by which\r\nSumatra is run into the country, prices for 1883 Wisconsin leaf will not\r\nbe materially affected, as it can not entirely supplant its use and\r\nthere will be a good demand for all our product. The editor adds: The\r\nscarecrow argument will doubtless be used by some buyers in bearing the\r\nmarket, but we are inclined to look upon it more as a bugaboo than many\r\nothers, whatever the effect may be on future crops. We know of no good\r\nreason why 1883 Wisconsin should sell for lower prices than have ruled\r\nthus far this season and the report from Eastern markets seem to warrant\r\nthis view.\r\n\r\nA. B. Allen, in N. Y. Tribune: My cistern is about five feet in diameter\r\nand five feet deep. After cleaning it out in spring, I put about one\r\nbushel of sand in the bottom, and then let the rain-water come in. This\r\nkeeps the water sweet and clear for a whole year. I have tried charcoal\r\nand various things for this purpose, but find pure clear sand best of\r\nall. It must not have other soil mixed with it, or any vegetable matter.\r\nThe kind I use is white, and very like such as is found at the sea\r\nshore. Of course the roof end of the pipe should have wire gauze\r\nfastened over it so that no foul stuff can be carried down, and the\r\neaves-troughs must be kept clean, the roof and chimneys also, and never\r\nbe painted, or the latter even whitewashed. The sand is an excellent\r\nabsorber of even the finest of foul stuff, and this is the reason, in\r\naddition to its own purity, of its keeping the water so free from\r\ngenerating the smell of ammonia.\r\n\r\nPeoria Transcript: During some of the comparatively idle days of winter,\r\nthe farmer may combine pleasure with profit by hitching up, taking his\r\nfamily, and driving to some one of his successful farm neighbors for a\r\nfriendly visit. Such an act may be looked upon by the man-of-toil as a\r\npoor excuse to get out of doing a day's work, but we venture that he who\r\ntries the experiment once will be very apt to repeat it as often as time\r\nor opportunity will justify. In our neighborhood, and we presume the\r\nsame condition of affairs exists in nearly every locality, there are\r\nfarmers who have lived within a mile or two of each other for years, who\r\nhardly know their neighbors from a stranger when they meet upon the\r\npublic highway or at town meeting, and as for going to the house,\r\nnothing short of death in the family or some event of great importance\r\nwill ever bring them into the friendly relations which should exist\r\nbetween neighboring farmers.\r\n\r\nA New Jersey correspondent of the Rural New Yorker writes: My clear\r\nwater carp pond covers an area of about three-fourths of an acre, and is\r\nlocated about eighty feet below springs in the hillside, which furnish a\r\nnever-failing supply of pure, clear water. The normal temperature of\r\nthese springs, where they empty into the pond, varies but little\r\naccording to season, but maintains an average of fifty degrees, Fah.\r\nSeveral times through the summer I found the water in the pond indicated\r\nan average of 80 degrees, Fah. The pond is so constructed that the water\r\nis constantly drawn from the bottom, thus keeping the surface at this\r\nhigh temperature. About one-half the pond is covered with mud to the\r\ndepth of two feet or more--an essential in all carp ponds for\r\nhibernating. A limited supply of pure German carp fingerlings to place\r\nin the pond was sent me by Prof. S. F. Baird, United States Commissioner\r\nof Fish and Fisheries, Washington, D. C., and placed therein on April\r\n6th last. No food was given besides that which grew in the pond. I saw\r\nthem at rare intervals during the summer, and was agreeably surprised,\r\nwhen I drew the pond November 16th last past, to find that they had\r\ngrown to be sixteen inches in length, and a pair weighed eight pounds.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE MONARCH LIGHTNING SAWING MACHINE.\r\n\r\nOn our 268th page appears the advertisement of the New Improved Monarch\r\nLightning Sawing Machine, manufactured by the Monarch Mfg.

The\r\nattendance was light. The general sentiment expressed was that sheep\r\ngrowing was profitable in Iowa, if the dogs could be got rid of. The\r\nLegislature will be importuned to abolish the curs. The session the last\r\nevening was devoted to the tariff on wool. The petition of the Ohio\r\nsheep-growers, presented to Congress, asking a restoration of the tariff\r\nlaw of 1867 on wool, was read and unanimously accepted. Officers for the\r\nensuing year were elected as follows: S. P. McNeil, Gordon Grove,\r\nPresident; J. C. Robinson, Albia, Samuel Russell, West Grove, and A. N.\r\nStewart, Grove Station, Vice-Presidents; A. J. Blakely, Grinnell,\r\nSecretary.\r\n\r\n\r\nPolled Cattle-Breeders.\r\n\r\nTwenty-seven head of Galloway and Angus cattle, belonging to A. B.\r\nMatthews, Kansas City, were sold at auction at Des Moines, Iowa, January\r\n9th, at prices ranging from $235 to $610. The sale aggregated $10,425,\r\nor $386 per head. In the evening of the same day some twenty-five polled\r\ncattle-breeders met and organized a State association. An address was\r\nread by Abner Graves, of Dow City, in which the breed was duly extolled.\r\nAn interesting discussion followed, in the course of which it was stated\r\nthat the polled breeds have two anatomical peculiarities in common with\r\nthe American bison, indicating a close relation to, or possible descent\r\nfrom the buffalo family. The officers elected were: President, Abner\r\nGraves, of Dow City; Vice-Presidents, Messrs. Bryan, of Montezuma, D. J.\r\nMoore, of Dunlop, and Charles Farwell, of Montezuma; Secretary and\r\nTreasurer, H. G. Gue, of Des Moines. Liberal subscriptions were made to\r\nthe articles of incorporation which were formed inside the organization,\r\nafter the meeting adjourned.\r\n\r\n\r\nMerino Sheep Breeders.\r\n\r\nThe sixth annual meeting of the Northern Illinois Merino Sheep Breeders'\r\nAssociation was held at Elgin, January 9th. The meeting was well\r\nattended and enthusiastic. George E. Peck presided. The annual report of\r\nSecretary Vandercook showed the association to be in a growing\r\ncondition. The discussion of the day was mainly on the tariff question.\r\nA communication from Columbus Delano, President of the National\r\nWool-Growers Association was read, asking for the co-operation of the\r\nsociety in a move upon Congress for the restoration of duties on\r\nimported wools as they were established by the act of 1867 met with a\r\nhearty reception. Thomas McD. Richards delivered an interesting address\r\non wool-growing and the merino as a mutton sheep. He argued that a\r\nprevailing idea to the effect that good mutton could not come from\r\nfine-wool sheep was entirely erroneous. Touching on the tariff question\r\nhe said the past year had been an unprofitable one to mere wool-growers,\r\nand that sheep had been unsalable at paying prices. The removal of the\r\nduty on wool had paralyzed the industry, and the tariff must be\r\nrestored. There was an abundance of competition among the wool-growers\r\nof our own land without compelling them to compete with the stockmen of\r\nSouth America and Australia. The farmers had not clamored for a removal\r\nof the duty on wool. If the tariff was not restored the wool interests\r\nof the country would be ruined. Already legislation had lowered the\r\nprice of wool several cents, and had depreciated the value of sheep at\r\nleast $1 per head. The tariff was also dilated upon by Col. John S.\r\nWilcox, of Elgin, Daniel Kelley, of Wheaton, and Asa H. Crary. The\r\nconclusion arrived at was that energetic and united action for the\r\nrestoration of the duty was the thing desired. V. P. Richmond read an\r\ninteresting essay on \"Merinos; Their Characteristics and Attributes.\"\r\nThe annual election of officers resulted as follows: President, George\r\nE. Peck, Geneva; Vice-Presidents, Thomas McD. Richards, Woodstock, and\r\nDaniel Kelley, Wheaton; Secretary and Treasurer, W. C. Vandercook,\r\nCherry Valley. It was decided to hold the association's annual public\r\nsheep-shearing at Richmond, McHenry county, April 29 and 30, and C. R.\r\nLawson, L. H. Smith, and A. S. Peck were designated a committee to\r\nrepresent the association at the annual sheep-shearing of the Wisconsin\r\nassociation.\r\n\r\n\r\nCattle Disease.\r\n\r\nThe House committee on agriculture last week discussed in a general way\r\nthe subject of pleuro pneumonia in cattle. Mr. Loring, Commissioner of\r\nAgriculture, expressed his views upon the subject in a short speech. Mr.\r\nGrinnell, of Iowa, chairman of the committee appointed by the convention\r\nof cattle men, in Chicago, to visit Washington to influence Legislation\r\nin reference to diseased cattle, was present. It was arranged that a\r\nsub-committee, consisting of Congressmen Hatch, Dibrell, Williams,\r\nWinans, Wilson, and Ochiltree, should meet the representatives of the\r\ncattle interests at the Agricultural Department. Pleuro-pneumonia among\r\ncattle will be the first subject considered. The House committee on\r\nagriculture will report a bill at an early day.\r\n\r\nThe assistant Secretary of the Treasury has transmitted to the House the\r\nreport of the cattle commission, consisting of James Law, E. F. Thayer,\r\nand J. H. Sanders, for the past year. The commission recommended that\r\nthe National Government prevent the shipment northward, out of the area\r\ninfected with Texas fever, of all cattle whatsoever, excepting from the\r\nbeginning of November to the beginning of March. Special attention is\r\ninvited by the Assistant Secretary to the recommendation of the\r\ncommission that the Secretary of the Treasury be empowered to order the\r\nslaughter and safe disposal of all imported herds that may be found\r\ninfected on their arrival in the United States, or may develop a\r\ndangerous or contagious disease during quarantine; and that he be also\r\nempowered to have all ruminants (other than cattle) and all swine\r\nimported into the United States, subjected to inspection by veterinary\r\nsurgeons, and if necessary to prevent the spread of contagious diseases,\r\nslaughtered or submitted to quarantine until they shall be considered\r\nuninfected; and that an appropriation of $1,500,000 be made to defray\r\nthe expenses of preventing a further spread of the lung plague among\r\ncattle in this country, and for stamping out the plague now existing. A\r\nsupplemental report of the majority of commission, submitted by Law and\r\nThayer, and of a later date than the first report is also submitted.\r\nThis report deals especially with the inadequacy to the end sought to be\r\naccomplished of the inspection of cattle at ports of export, and\r\nrecommends that such inspection and guarantee be delayed. Their reason\r\nfor doubting the adequacy of the inspection at ports of exports is that\r\nneither lung plague nor Texas fever can be certainly detected by such\r\nexamination, because those diseases pass through an average stage of\r\nincubation for thirty days, during which it is impossible for the most\r\naccomplished expert to detect the presence of the germ in the system.\r\nThe result would be, if such an inspection were the only thing relied\r\nupon, that cattle which had been exposed to infection in the stock yards\r\nseveral days before inspection would pass that inspection, but three\r\nweeks later, when they arrived at a foreign port, would show marked\r\nsymptoms of the disease. This result destroys absolutely the efficacy of\r\nthe certificates of inspection as to guarantees to foreign imported\r\ncattle. The report closes with the statement that so long as the\r\ninfected districts in this country can not be secluded, the landing of\r\ninfected cattle in England from this country can not be prevented, and\r\nso long as American cattle show these diseases on their arrival in\r\nEngland we can hope for no modification of the present restrictions that\r\ncountry places against American cattle.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the conference between House sub-committee on agriculture and the\r\nChicago convention committee a general discussion on contagious diseases\r\namong cattle was indulged in. The committee of cattle men, in answer to\r\nthe inquiries of representatives, said diseases existed in Delaware, the\r\nDistrict of Columbia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Connecticut, New\r\nYork, and possibly in other places. In New York a few counties are\r\nreported infected.\r\n\r\nMr. Hunt, of New Jersey, said if Congress would appropriate an adequate\r\namount payable to the order of the authorities of the different States\r\nand protect New Jersey for six months from the importation of diseased\r\ncattle, the State in that time would stamp out pleuro-pneumonia in its\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\nDr. Law, of the Cattle Commission of the Treasury Department, said the\r\ndisease was undoubtedly the result of importation. He said that with\r\nplenty of money and a Federal law it could be eradicated in twelve\r\nmonths. New York City had at one time stamped it out in three months. He\r\nadvocated the burning of buildings where the disease occurred.\r\n\r\nJudge Carey, of Wyoming, gave the history of the disease, saying it was\r\nlike Asiatic cholera spreading through Europe and reaching New York\r\nforty years ago. It existed on the continent of Europe, in Great\r\nBritain, Australia, New Zealand, and this country. He said $100,000,000\r\nwas invested in the cattle business of the United States.\r\n\r\nRepresentative Hatch said that Mr. Singleton, of Illinois, had offered\r\n$1,000 reward for an animal afflicted with pleuro-pneumonia, but no one\r\nhad accepted.\r\n\r\nSeveral members of the cattle committee at once offered to show the\r\ndisease to any one doubting its existence.\r\n\r\nRepresentative Weller gave notice that he would offer a bill\r\nappropriating $10,000,000 by the Government for suppressing contagious\r\ndiseases among cattle, to be distributed among the States and\r\nTerritories in the ratio of representation in Congress, provided that\r\neach State appropriated a sum equal to the amount given by the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nThe legislation proposed is to make the shipment of cattle known to be\r\ndiseased a penal offense; to establish a cattle bureau in the Department\r\nof Agriculture; increase the power of the Commissioner of Agriculture;\r\nprovide funds for an elaborate investigation of the diseases of cattle;\r\nand provide an appropriation to purchase diseased cattle so they can be\r\ndestroyed. An appropriation will be asked the first year of $500,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HORSE AND HIS TREATMENT.\r\n\r\nNUMBER TWO.\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst, as regards food. The horse is naturally a wild animal and\r\ntherefore, though domesticated, he demands such food as nature would\r\nprovide for him. But man seems to forget this. Nature's food would be\r\nlargely of grass. It is true that when domesticated and put to hard work\r\nhe needs some food of a more concentrated and highly nutritious nature\r\nthan grass; but while labor may necessitate grain, the health of his\r\nsystem yet demands a liberal allowance of grass. In direct opposition to\r\nthis many farmers keep their horses off pasture while they are at work,\r\nwhich comprises almost the entire season of green pasture. I have\r\nfrequently heard farmers say that their horses did best during the\r\nspring and summer, if kept in the stable at night. I can only say that I\r\nhave found the very opposite to be true and I believe I have carefully\r\nand faithfully tested the matter. I have found that when the horses were\r\nallowed the range of a blue grass pasture at night, they endured work\r\nthe best because they digested their grain and hay better, and good\r\ndigestion made good appetites. In fact, I consider pasture the best food\r\nand the best medicine a horse can be given. If his coat is rough, if he\r\nis stiff and lifeless, if he is losing flesh and strength, turn him on\r\npasture and he will soon grow better.\r\n\r\nSome grasses make far better pasture than others. All in all, I consider\r\nblue grass the best. It comes earliest in the spring, and while very\r\npalatable and easily digested, seems to possess more substance than\r\nother grasses. Next I would place timothy. Clover is good medicine for a\r\nsick horse, but because of its action on the salivary glands is apt to\r\nmake work horses \"slobber\" at certain seasons.\r\n\r\nFor winter, hay is provided. But how is it provided in a majority of\r\ncases? The grass is cut out of season; is cured negligently, very likely\r\nis exposed to rain; and then piled up to mold and rot. A few tarpaulins\r\nto put over the cocks in case of rain, and barracks or mow to protect\r\nand preserve the hay would give the horse good hay, and be one of the\r\nvery best of investments. It should be remembered that the digestive\r\norgans of none other of our farm animals are so easily deranged as those\r\nof the horse. Musty, moldy hay is the moving cause of much disease. The\r\nman who can not provide a good mow should sell his horses to some farmer\r\nwho can manage better.\r\n\r\nThough blue grass is the best for pasture, timothy is the best for hay.\r\nClover makes better hay than blue grass. Corn fodder has substance, and\r\npound for pound contains about two-thirds as much nutriment as hay. But\r\nit is not good forage for the horse. Where hay is procurable corn\r\nfodder should never be fed.\r\n\r\nI am convinced that the great majority of farmers do nor feed their\r\nhorses enough forage. I know of farmers who do not feed hay at all when\r\ntheir horses are at work, which is more than half the year. Grain is fed\r\nexclusively. Yet they wonder why their horses lose flesh and have rough\r\ncoats. Feeding a horse all grain is like feeding a man all meat. The\r\nfood is so oily and difficult of digestion that it soon deranges the\r\ndigestive organs. The horse should have all the hay he wishes to eat, at\r\nall seasons of the year. This brings me to another error in his\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nWhen at work the horse should have at least ninety minutes for each\r\nmeal. My observation convinces me that a large number of farmers do not\r\ngive him this much time. Their reason for neglecting to do so is, that\r\nit would be a loss of time. But the very opposite of this is the case.\r\nTime is gained. The horse has opportunity to eat slowly, which is\r\nessential to complete digestion; can eat all he wishes; and has time to\r\nrest after eating, giving the organs of digestion a chance to work. Give\r\nyour horse an hour and a half to eat his noon-day meal, at least, and at\r\nthe end of the season you will find that by so doing you have gained\r\ntime. He may not have walked before the plow and harrow so many hours,\r\nbut he has stepped faster and pulled more energetically.\r\n\r\nAnother error is the feeding of too much grain. Some farmers have grain\r\nin the feeding troughs all the time during the spring and summer. The\r\nhorse is sated. This manner may do for a hog, whose only business is to\r\nlie around, grunt, and put on fat; but for a horse it will not do. A\r\nhorse should never be given all the grain he will eat. At every meal he\r\nshould clean out his box, and then be ready to eat hay for at least\r\nfifteen minutes.\r\n\r\nAnother error is in confining the grain feed almost altogether to corn.\r\nCorn is a heavy, gross diet. It contains a large proportion of oil, and\r\ntends to produce lymph and fat, which are inimical to health, and\r\ndestructive of vigor and endurance. Oats is a much better food; yet it\r\nis very rarely fed in the South, and not half of the farmers of the\r\nNorth feed it. Corn heats the blood, and on this account should not be\r\nfed in hot weather. Oats is a lighter, easier diet, does not heat the\r\nblood, and makes muscle, rather than fat. All in all, oats is the most\r\neconomical food, at least for horses at work in hot weather.\r\n\r\nOne more error which I shall notice in feeding is the giving of too much\r\ndry food. The horse does best upon moist food, or that which has a large\r\npercentage of water in its composition. Carrots, turnips, beets,\r\npumpkins, etc., may be given in small quantities with decided advantage,\r\nespecially in the winter. In summer the hay should be sprinkled with\r\nwater, and the oats soaked. This will not only make the food more\r\npalatable and easily digested, but will obviate the necessity of\r\nwatering after meals. Many object to watering after the horse has eaten,\r\nbecause the fluid carries the grain into the intestines where it can not\r\nbe digested. But if grain and forage are dampened, the horse will not\r\nrequire watering after a meal. He will rarely drink if water is offered\r\nhim, and the moisture will aid digestion. This is surely better and more\r\nhumane than to give a horse dry food and then work him for six or seven\r\nhours in the hot sun, afterward, without any drink.\r\n\r\nOf the quality of water given to the horse there is not much to condemn.\r\nHe generally gets better water than the hog, or sheep, because he is\r\nvery fastidious in this matter and will not drink foul water unless\r\ndriven to do so by dire necessity. But I believe that three times is not\r\noften enough to water a horse at work in hot weather, though this is the\r\ncommon and time honored practice. The stomach of the horse is\r\nsmall--very small in proportion to the size of his body. When he has\r\nlabored in summer for half a day his thirst is intense, and when he is\r\npermitted to slake it he drinks too much, producing really serious\r\ndisorders. No valid objection can be urged against watering five times\r\nper day. The arguments are all in its favor.\r\n\r\nThe errors in stabling are fully as grievous as any we have noticed. I\r\nhave lately written of the evils of lack of light and proper ventilation\r\nin these columns, and also discussed the problem of currying in various\r\nphases, so shall not repeat here what I have heretofore written. One of\r\nthe other evils of stable management often allowed, is the accumulation\r\nof manure. It is not within the scope of this article to notice the evil\r\nthe neglect to save manure works to the farm and the farmer. But that\r\nthe accumulation of the manure in the stable is a hurt to the horse, no\r\nsensibly reasoning person can doubt. Its fermentation gives off\r\nobnoxious gases which pollute and poison the air the horse is\r\ncompelled to breathe, and thus in turn poison the animal's blood. This\r\nis a more fruitful cause of disease than is generally supposed. The\r\ngases prove injurious to the eye, and when we consider the accumulation\r\nof manure and the exclusion of light, we are not apt to wonder much at\r\nthe prevalence of blindness among horses. The manure should be cleaned\r\nout in the morning, at noon, and again at night. Use sawdust or straw\r\nliberally for bedding. It will absorb the urine, and as soon as foul,\r\nshould be removed to the compost heap with the dung, where it will soon\r\nbe converted into fine, excellent manure.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that deserves attention is the stable floor. I\r\nunhesitatingly say that a composition of clay and fine gravel is best.\r\nPavement is the worst, and planks are next. The clay and gravel should\r\nbe put in just moist enough to pack solidly. Stamp till very firm and\r\nthen allow to dry and harden for a week. The stable floor should be kept\r\nperfectly level. Do not make the horse stand in a strained, unnatural\r\nposition. The stall should be large enough for him to move around--at\r\nleast six feet wide. Narrow stalls are a nuisance but very common.\r\n\r\nJOHN M. STAHL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOST OF PORK ON 1883 CORN.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout three weeks ago the \"Man of the Prairie\" wanted to know how many\r\npounds of pork a bushel of corn would make this year. As I wanted to\r\nknow the same thing I have weighed my hogs every week and also the corn\r\nI fed them, and for the benefit of your readers I will give the results:\r\n\r\nDecember 10--15 hogs, weight 4,130\r\n    \"    17--\"   \"      \"    4,280   ate 960 lbs Corn.\r\n    \"    24--\"   \"      \"    4,410   \"   864      \"\r\n    \"    31--\"   \"      \"    4,572   \"   816      \"\r\n\r\nThis gives a gain, in twenty-one days, of 442 lbs, and they ate in that\r\ntime 2,640 lbs., or 47-1/7 bu. corn.\r\n\r\nThe corn was planted about the eighth of May; was the large white\r\nvariety; is quite loose on the cob, and a good many of the ears are\r\nmouldy. A common bushel basket holds of it in ear 35 lbs. The hogs were\r\nfed the corn in ear twice a day, and had all the water they wanted to\r\ndrink. This gives 9-62/165 lbs. pork to the bushel. At the present price\r\nof pork ($5.25) it would make the corn worth about 49-1/2 cts. per\r\nbushel.\r\n\r\n    G. W. POWESS.\r\n        WINNEBAGO CO., ILL.\r\n\r\nP.S. The weight of corn given is its weight shelled, as it shells out 55\r\nlbs from 80 lbs. in ear.\r\n\r\n    G. F. P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVETERINARY\r\n\r\n\r\nGrease, So-Called.\r\n\r\nThis ailment occurs sometimes in the fore feet, but oftener in the hind\r\nfeet; and though neither contagious nor epizootic, it not unfrequently\r\nappears about one time or within a brief period, on most or all of the\r\nhorses in a stable. It essentially consists in a stoppage of the normal\r\nsecretions of the skin, which is beneficially provided for maintaining a\r\nsoft condition of the skin of the heel, and preventing chapping and\r\nexcoriation; and it usually develops itself in redness, dryness, and\r\nscurfiness of the skin; but in bad or prolonged cases, it is accompanied\r\nwith deep cracks, an ichorous discharge, more or less lameness, and even\r\ngreat ulceration, and considerable fungus growth; and in the worst cases\r\nit spreads athwart all the heel, extends on the fetlock, or ascends the\r\nleg, and is accompanied with extensive swelling and a general oozing\r\ndischarge, of a peculiar strong, disagreeable odor.\r\n\r\nMost of the causes of grease are referable to bad management, especially\r\nin regard to great and sudden changes in the exterior temperature of the\r\nheels. The feet of the horse may be alternately heated by the bedding\r\nand cooled by draft from the open stable door; or they may first be made\r\nhot and sensitive by the irritating action of the urine and filth on the\r\nstable floor, and then violently reacted on by the cold breezes of the\r\nopen air, or they may be moist and reeking when the horse is led out to\r\nwork, and then chilled for a long period by the slow evaporation of the\r\nmoisture from them amid the clods and soil of the field; or they may be\r\nwarm and even perspiring with the labor of the day, and next plunged\r\ninto a stream or washed with cold water, and then allowed to dry partly\r\nin the open air and partly in the stable; and in many of these ways, or\r\nof any others which occasion sudden changes of temperature in the heels,\r\nespecially when those changes are accompanied or aggravated by the\r\nirritating action of filth, grease is exceedingly liable to be induced.\r\nWant of exercise, high feeding, and whatever tends to accumulate or to\r\nstagnate the normal greasy secretion in the skin of the heels, also\r\noperate, in some degree, as causes. By mere good management and by\r\navoiding these known causes, horse owners might prevent the appearance\r\nof this disease altogether.\r\n\r\nIn the early, dry, scurfy stage of grease, the heels may be well cleaned\r\nwith soft soap and water, and afterwards thoroughly dried, and then\r\ntreated with a dilution of Goulard's extract--one part to eight parts of\r\nwater, or one part with six parts of lard oil. In the mildest form of\r\nthe stage of cracks and ichorous discharge, after cleansing, some drying\r\npowder, such as equal quantities of white lead and putty (impure\r\nprotoxide of zinc), may be applied, or simply the mixture of Goulard's\r\nextract with lard oil may be continued. In the virulent form of cracks,\r\naccompanied with ulceration, the heels ought to be daily washed clean\r\nwith warm water, and afterwards bathed with a mild astringent lotion,\r\nand every morning and evening thinly poulticed or coated with carbolized\r\nointment; and the whole system ought to be acted on by alteratives, by\r\nnightly bran mash, and, if the animal be in full condition, with a dose\r\nof purgative medicine. In the worst and most extensively spread cases,\r\npoultices of a very cooling kind, particularly poultices of scraped\r\ncarrots or scraped turnips, ought to be used day and night, both for the\r\nsake of their own action, and as preparatives to the action of the\r\nastringent application; and the whole course of treatment ought to aim\r\nat the abatement of the inflammatory action, previous to the stopping of\r\nthe discharge. Nothing tends so much to prevent grease and swelling of\r\nthe legs as frequent hand rubbing and cleansing the heels carefully as\r\nsoon as a horse comes in from exercise or work. In inveterate cases of\r\ngrease, where the disease appears to have become habitual, in some\r\ndegree, a run at grass, when in season, is the only remedy. If a dry\r\npaddock is available, where a horse can be sheltered in bad weather, it\r\nwill be found extremely convenient; as in such circumstances, he may\r\nperform his usual labor, and at the same time be kept free from the\r\ncomplaint.\r\n\r\n\r\nFoul in the Foot.\r\n\r\nThis name is given to a disease in cattle, which presents a resemblance\r\nto foot rot in sheep, but is different from this. It appears to be\r\nalways occasioned by the neglect and aggravation of wounds and ulcers\r\noriginating in mechanical injury--particularly in the insinuating of\r\npieces of stone, splinters of wood, etc., between the claws of the hoof,\r\nor in the wearing, splitting, or bruising of the horn, and consequent\r\nabrasion of the sensible foot; by walking for an undue length of time,\r\nor a long distance upon gravelly or flinty roads, or other hard and\r\neroding surfaces. It is sometimes ascribed, indeed, to a wet state of\r\nthe pasture; but moisture merely predisposes to it, by softening the\r\nhoof and diminishing its power of resisting mechanical injury.\r\n\r\nThe ulcers of foul in the foot usually occur about the coronet and\r\nextend under the hoof, causing much inflammatory action, very great\r\npain, and more or less separation of the hoof; but they often originate\r\nin uneven pressure upon the sole, and rise upward from a crack between\r\nthe claws, and are principally or wholly confined to one side or claw of\r\nthe foot. A fetid purulent discharge proceeds from the ulcers, and a\r\nsinus may sometimes be discovered by means of a probe to descend from\r\nthe coronet beneath the hoof. The affected animal is excessively lame,\r\nand may possibly suffer such a degree of pain as to lose all appetite\r\nand become sickly and emaciated.\r\n\r\nIf the disease is of a mild form, or be merely in the initiatory stage,\r\nit may be readily cured by cleaning, fomentation, and rest; if it be of\r\na medium character, between mild and violent, it may be cured by\r\ncleaning, by carefully paring away loose and detached horn, by destroying\r\nany fungus growth, and by applying, with a feather, a little butyr of\r\nantimony; and if it be of a very bad form, or has been long neglected,\r\nit will require to be probed, lanced, or otherwise dealt with according\r\nto the rules of good surgery, and afterwards poulticed twice a day with\r\nlinseed meal, and frequently, but lightly, touched with butyr of\r\nantimony.\r\n\r\n\r\nFounder.\r\n\r\nThis disease consists in inflammation of the laminæ and of the vascular\r\nparts of the sensible foot. It sometimes attacks only one foot,\r\nsometimes two, and sometimes all four; but, in a great majority of\r\ncases, it attacks either one or both of the front feet. A chronic form\r\nsometimes occurs, and exhibits symptoms somewhat similar to those of\r\ncontraction of the hoof; but acute inflammation of the laminæ is what is\r\ngenerally called founder.\r\n\r\nThis disease is occasioned by overstraining of the laminæ from long\r\nstanding, by prolonged or excessive driving over hard roads, by\r\ncongestion from long confinement, by sudden reaction from standing in\r\nsnow after being heated, or from covering with warm bedding after\r\nprolonged exposure to cold, by sudden change of diet from a\r\ncomparatively cool to a comparatively heating kind of food, and by\r\ntranslation of inflammatory action from some other part of the body,\r\nparticularly after influenza.\r\n\r\nIn the early stages of founder, a horse evinces great pain, shows\r\nexcessive restlessness of foot, and tries to lighten the pressure of his\r\nbody on the diseased feet. In the more advanced stages he is feverish,\r\nbreathes hard, has violent throbbing in the arteries of the fetlock,\r\nlies down, stretches out his legs, and sometimes gazes wistfully upon\r\nthe seat of the disease; and in the ulterior stages, if no efficacious\r\nremedies have been applied, the diseased feet either naturally recover\r\ntheir healthy condition, or they suppurate, slough, cast part or all of\r\nthe hoof, and gradually acquire a small, weak, new hoof, or they undergo\r\nsuch mortification and change of tissues as to render the animal\r\npermanently useless.\r\n\r\nThe shoe of a foundered foot must be removed; the hoof should be pared\r\nin such a manner that the sole and central portion of the same alone\r\ncome to sustain the weight of the body. Therefore, the wall of the hoof,\r\nor that portion of the hoof which, under normal conditions, is made to\r\nbear upon the shoe, should be pared or rasped away, all around, to such\r\nan extent that it does not touch the ground when the animal stands upon\r\nthe foot. A well-bedded shed, or a roomy, well-bedded box-stall, should\r\nbe provided, with a view of allowing ample room for stretching out, as\r\nwell as for changing position on a floor which should not be slanting,\r\nand which conveniences can not be had in a single stall, or when the\r\nanimal is kept tied up in a confined space. Fomentations, evaporating\r\nlotions, wet cloths, and moist poultices should be applied to the feet.\r\nThe animal ought to have light and spare diet, and bran mashes. When\r\nmuch fever exists febrifuges and diuretics should be given.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ANSWERED.\r\n\r\nCOW DRYING UP UNEVENLY. D. W., AUBURN, ILL.--1. What is the cause of a\r\ncow going dry in one teat? She dropped her calf the 25th of May, and it\r\nsucked till it was three months old two teats on one side; that was her\r\nthird calf; her next one will be due the last of April next. For some\r\nsix weeks past the quantity of milk has been diminishing, till now she\r\ndoes not give more than a gill from one teat, while the opposite one\r\ngives more than double that of either of the others. Can any thing be\r\ndone to remedy the difficulty? 2. If a cow gives more milk on one side\r\nthan the other, does it indicate the sex of the coming calf?\r\n\r\nREPLY.--Most likely the cow will give milk from all four quarters after\r\ncalving. She should be allowed to gradually dry up now, and toward the\r\ntime of calving, she should not be fed exclusively on dry food. 2. No.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE DAIRY.\r\n\r\nDairymen, Write for Your Paper.\r\n\r\n\r\nCuring Cheese.\r\n\r\nThe curing of cheese develops not only flavor, but texture and\r\ndigestibility. As a rule, says an English exchange, no American cheese\r\nis well cured, and this is for want of suitable curing houses. Dr. H.\r\nReynolds, of Livermore Falls, Me., remarks upon this subject as follows:\r\n\"Increased attention needs to be given by cheese-makers to this matter\r\nof curing cheese. Cheese factories should be provided with suitable\r\ncuring rooms, where a uniform temperature of the required degree can be\r\nmaintained, together with a suitable degree of moisture and sufficient\r\nsupply of fresh air. The expense required to provide a suitable curing\r\nroom would be small compared to the increased value of the cheese\r\nproduct thereby secured. Small dairymen and farmers, having only a few\r\ncows, labor under some difficulties in the way of providing suitable\r\ncuring room for their cheese. Yet if they have a clear idea of what a\r\ncuring room should be, they will generally be able to provide something\r\nwhich will approximate to what is needed. Good curing rooms are\r\nabsolutely needed in order to enable our cheese-makers to produce a\r\nreally fine article of cheese. The nicer the quality of cheese produced,\r\nthe higher the price it will bring, and the more desirable will it\r\nbecome as an article of food. In the curing of cheese certain\r\nrequisites are indispensable in order to attain the best results. Free\r\nexposure to air is one requisite for the development of flavor. Curd\r\nsealed up in an air-tight vessel and kept at the proper temperature\r\nreadily breaks down into a soft, rich, ripe cheese, but it has none of\r\nthe flavor so much esteemed in good cheese. Exposure to the oxygen of\r\nthe air develops flavor. The cheese during the process of curding takes\r\nin oxygen and gives off carbonic acid gas. This fact was proved by Dr.\r\nS. M. Babcock, of Cornell University, who, by analyzing the air passing\r\nover cheese while curding, found that the cheese was constantly taking\r\nin oxygen and giving off carbonic acid gas. The development of flavor\r\ncan be hastened by subjecting the cheese to a strong current of air. The\r\nflavor is developed by the process of oxidation. If the cheese is kept\r\nin too close air during the process of curding, it will be likely to be\r\ndeficient in flavor.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn anonymous writer very truly remarks that the dairyman, by the force\r\nof circumstances, has to become versed in the breeding and management of\r\nstock, especially that of dairy breeds; hence, in the very nature of\r\nthings, he becomes a thoughtful, studious, observing man, and, what is\r\nbetter, he attains a higher intelligence. The advantages of dairying\r\ncall out, among other things, enhanced revenues, because butter and\r\ncheese have become necessities; it enriches the farm, and is perfectly\r\nadapted to foster the breeding and raising of better and more stock. It\r\nembodies thrift, progress, and prosperity. Under \"new methods\" it makes\r\nfine butter and choice beef, not by any means less, but even more, and\r\naffords better grain. It does not imply farm houses with added burdens,\r\nbut, on the contrary, relieved of drudgery, and the time thus gained can\r\nbe spent in cultivating the refining graces, and thus making farmers'\r\nhomes abodes of culture, refinement, and education, placing the dairy\r\nfarmer upon a level financially, socially, and intellectually with any\r\nother class or profession.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS.\r\n\r\nTHE RURAL NEW-YORKER\r\n\r\nThe great national farm and garden journal of America, with its\r\nCelebrated Free Seed Distribution, and\r\n\r\nTHE PRAIRIE FARMER\r\n\r\none year, post-paid, all for only $3.00.

A stranger might\r\nthink that this is not the place for them at this particular time of\r\nyear. But in this he shows his ignorance of Western farm economy--for it\r\nis the very place for them; the identical locality where a great many of\r\nour farmers choose to keep their costly implements. Besides--don't you\r\nsee, our farmers believe in fostering the manufactures of our country;\r\nand this place of caring for their tools after using them adds 15 or 20\r\nper cent to the business of the manufacturers.\r\n\r\n\r\nABOUT THE BORER.\r\n\r\nI referred to the fact that I had lately been cutting away, digging up,\r\nand making stove-wood of a number of dead and decaying apple trees. Some\r\nof them had been dead and dying for two or three years. In splitting up\r\nthe body and roots of one of these, I dislodged scores of the borers, of\r\nall ages and sizes--making quite a dinner for a hen and chickens that\r\nhappened to be nigh. This fact brought forcibly to my mind what I should\r\nhave thought of before, namely--that these dead and dying trees ought\r\nnot to be allowed to remain a day after their usefulness has departed;\r\nbut should be removed bodily and consigned to the flames. Otherwise they\r\nremain as breeding places for the pests, to the great detriment of the\r\nrest of the orchard. Cut away your decaying trees at once.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOAL ASHES.\r\n\r\nNow that coal has become so common as a substitute for wood for fuel,\r\nnot only on the railroads and manufactories, but in the villages and on\r\nthe farms, wood ashes will still be harder to procure. Though not near\r\nso valuable for the purposes for which wood ashes is chiefly used in\r\nhorticulture, it is believed that ashes from the coal has too great a\r\nvalue to be wasted. It should all be saved and applied to some good\r\npurpose on the garden or orchard. Has any one tried it as a preventive\r\nto pear blight? or mildew on the gooseberry? or the grape rot? or for\r\nthe yellows or leaf-curl in peach trees? or for the rust in the\r\nblackberry and raspberry? In any or all of these it may have a decided\r\nvalue, and should be faithfully experimented with. As an absorbent\r\nalone it ought to be worth saving, to use in retaining the house slops\r\nand other liquid manures that are too often wasted.\r\n\r\n\r\nONE CAUSE OF FAILURE\r\n\r\nin our orchard trees, of which we read and hear so much in late years,\r\nis doubtless to be found in the fact that we fail to feed them properly.\r\nA hog will fail to put on fat if he is not fed; a hen will not lay eggs\r\nif she is starved for food; and is it more reasonable to expect an apple\r\nor a peach or a pear tree to thrive and grow and yield of its luscious\r\nfruit in perfection while it is being starved? Our fresh soils--some of\r\nthem at least--contain a fair proportion of the food needed to support\r\nthe life of a tree; we plant our orchards, and for some years, more or\r\nless, they give us paying returns for our investments. But that food\r\nwill not always last; it is gradually exhausted, and we fail to feed\r\nthem again, or in that proportion their necessities require. They\r\nlanguish and die; a disease seizes them, and we complain and grumble at\r\nthe dispensations of Providence.\r\n\r\nThink of it, fellow fruit-growers; let us begin to treat our fruit trees\r\nas we do our hogs and our hens, and see if we can not be favored with\r\ncorresponding results. It is doubtless true that many of the diseases to\r\nwhich our trees are subject are caused by starvation, or by improper\r\nfeeding; and a sickly tree is much more certain to be attacked by\r\ninsects than a healthy one.\r\n\r\nRare, indeed, is the case where a tree is carefully fed and cared for,\r\nand its wants regularly and bountifully supplied, that it does not repay\r\nas bountifully in its life-giving fruits.\r\n\r\nT. G.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPEAR BLIGHT.\r\n\r\nTHE TWO THEORIES WITH REGARD TO ITS CAUSE, AND THEIR PRACTICAL VALUE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is assumed that this pest has cost agriculturists many millions of\r\ndollars during the past decade; not only in the loss of trees, but the\r\ntime--as it seldom appears until after the first crop--consequently the\r\nland, manure, labor, enclosure, and taxes are not insignificant items.\r\nClimate, soil, and cultivation have utterly failed, so also the\r\nnostrums, such as \"carbonate of lime\" suggested by the best authority,\r\nand the experts now admit that parasites (such as cause the rust or smut\r\nin our cereals) are the cause of this mischief. The only question is\r\nwhether they act directly or indirectly: this question determines\r\nwhether it is remediable. If these parasites accomplish all this\r\nmischief by direct contact, as in the case of rust, their ubiquitous\r\ncharacter is so demonstrated that we are utterly discouraged; whereas,\r\nif we prove that their indirect action is the only one that is to be\r\ndreaded, and that indirect action is remediable we are encouraged to\r\ncultivate the pear, though we have lost more than five hundred of one\r\nvariety and almost all of the other varieties before we discovered the\r\nreal cause of the failure. \"Where you lose you may find;\" success does\r\nnot indicate merit, and \"fools never learn by experience.\" As a\r\ncelebrated surgeon said in his lecture. \"A good oculist is made at the\r\nexpense of a hatful of eyes.\"\r\n\r\nThe celebrated Johnson who wrote the Encyclopedia of Agriculture a few\r\nyears since, is now regarded as an old fogy, because he assumed that the\r\nspores of smut travel from the manure and seed of the previous crop in\r\nthe circulation of the plant to the capsule, and thus convert the grain\r\ninto a puff-ball, so also the ears of corn, the oats, and rye. This\r\nmonstrosity on the rye grains is called ergot, or spurred rye, and when\r\nit is eaten by chickens or other fowls their feet and legs shrivel or\r\nperish with dry gangrene, not because the spores of the fungus which\r\nproduced the spurred rye circulate in the blood of the chicken, nor that\r\nthe spawn or mycelium thus traverses the fowl, but the peculiar and\r\nspecific influence acts upon the whole animal precisely like the poison\r\nof the poison oak, producing its specific effect on the most remote\r\nparts of the system, and not as mustard confined to the part it touches.\r\nThe mustard acts directly, but the \"poison Ivy\" acts indirectly; so also\r\nthe virus of cow-pox poisons the whole system, but usually appears in\r\nbut one spot unless the lymphatics of the whole arm are weak, and in\r\nthat case crops of umbilicated pustules precisely like the original, may\r\nrecur on all parts of the arm for several months. The specific effect of\r\nergot or the fungus when indirect is manifested by contracting and even\r\nstrangulating the tubes or capillaries causing them to pucker up (as a\r\npersimmon acts directly on the mouth), but in this case permanently\r\nthough indirectly, so that rye bread sometimes causes dry gangrene in\r\nthe human subject; the shins and feet shrivel precisely as those parts\r\nof the limbs of the pear do, moreover a dark fluid exudes (as the\r\ncirculation is arrested where a patch occurs) in both cases alike,\r\nconsequently if the remedy in both cases is based on the same\r\nprinciples, and is demonstrated to be equally effectual, the cause and\r\nthe disease are similar.\r\n\r\nI have seen dry gangrene in the human subject originate apparently from\r\nan old \"frost bite;\" which means merely chronic debility of the\r\ncapillaries of the foot or shin. Thus the extremities of the pear, or\r\nthe weakest part, always succumb first, and the most vigorous trees\r\nnever manifest it until they are weakened by their first crop of fruit.\r\nAll are familiar with the fact that an old frost bite will swell or\r\nsuccumb to a temperature which will be innocuous to any other part of\r\nthe body. The microscope may invariably reveal fungi in the patch of\r\npear blight precisely as the housewife discovers the mold plant in her\r\npreserves and canned fruit, and even in the eggs of fowls, the mycelium\r\n(or spawn) penetrating the fruit or preserve though it be covered while\r\nboiling hot. If so, the reason why all parts of the tree are not\r\nattacked at the same time, is not because the fungus is not ubiquitous.\r\nWe first notice the action of strychnia in the legs, or in paralyzed\r\nlimbs exclusively, because they are weaker and become subject to its\r\ninfluence more easily; so also the same tree may escape for a long time\r\nafter the limb which has succumbed is removed. Moreover the grafts,\r\nhowever numerous, may all be blighted, but the standard seedling on\r\nwhich so many varieties were grafted has survived more than fifty\r\nwinters, and it fruited last year.\r\n\r\n    DAVID STEWART, M. D.\r\n        PORT PENN, DEL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF TREE WOUNDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nValuable trees that have been wounded or mutilated are often sacrificed\r\nfor lack of the discreet surgery which would repair the injury they have\r\nsuffered; and Professor C. A. Sargent, of the Bussey Institution, has\r\ndone good service to farmers, fruit-raisers, and landscape-gardeners, by\r\ntranslating from the French the following practical hints, which we give\r\nwith slight abridgment:\r\n\r\nBark once injured or loosened can never attach itself again to the\r\ntrunk; and whenever wounds, abrasures, or sections of loose bark exist\r\non the trunk of a tree, the damaged part should be cut away cleanly, as\r\nfar as the injury extends. Careful persons have been known to nail to a\r\ntree a piece of loosened bark, in hope of inducing it to grow again, or\r\nat least of retaining on the young wood its natural covering.\r\nUnfortunately the result produced by this operation is exactly opposite\r\nto that intended. The decaying wood and bark attract thousands of\r\ninsects, which find here safe shelter and abundant food, and, increasing\r\nrapidly, hasten the death of the tree. In such cases, instead of\r\nrefastening the loosened bark to the tree, it should be entirely cut\r\naway, care being taken to give the cut a regular outline, especially on\r\nthe lower side; for if a portion of the bark, even if adhering to the\r\nwood, is left without direct communication with the leaves, it must die\r\nand decay. A coating of coal-tar should be applied to such wounds.\r\n\r\nLOOSENED BARK.--It is necessary to frequently examine the lower portions\r\nof the trunk, especially of trees beginning to grow old; for here is\r\noften found the cause of death in many trees, in large sheets of bark\r\nentirely separated from the trunk. This condition of things, which often\r\ncan not be detected, except by the hollow sound produced by striking the\r\ntrunk with the back of the iron pruning-knife, arrests the circulation\r\nof sap, while the cavity between the bark and the wood furnishes a safe\r\nretreat for a multitude of insects, which hasten the destruction of the\r\ntree. The dead bark should be entirely removed, even should it be\r\nnecessary, in so doing, to make large wounds. Cases of this nature\r\nrequire the treatment recommended for the last class.\r\n\r\nCAVITIES IN THE TRUNK.--Very often, when a tree has been long neglected,\r\nthe trunk is seriously injured by cavities caused by the decay of dead\r\nor broken branches. It is not claimed that pruning can remove defects of\r\nthis nature; it can with proper application, however, arrest the\r\nprogress of the evil. The edge of the cavity should be cut smooth and\r\neven; and all decomposed matter, or growth of new bark formed in the\r\ninterior, should be carefully removed. A coating of coal-tar should be\r\napplied to the surface of the cavity, and the mouth plugged with a piece\r\nof well-seasoned oak securely driven into the place. The end of the plug\r\nshould then be carefully pared smooth and covered with coal-tar,\r\nprecisely as if the stump of a branch were under treatment. If the\r\ncavity is too large to be closed in this manner, a piece of thoroughly\r\nseasoned oak board, carefully fitted to it, may be securely nailed into\r\nthe opening, and then covered with coal-tar. It is often advisable to\r\nguard against the attacks of insects by nailing a piece of zinc or other\r\nmetal over the board in such a way that the growth of the new wood will\r\nin time completely cover it.\r\n\r\nCoal-tar, a waste product of gas-works, can be applied with an ordinary\r\npainter's brush, and may be used cold, except in very cold weather, when\r\nit should be slightly warmed before application. Coal-tar has remarkable\r\npreservative properties, and may be used with equal advantage on living\r\nand dead wood. A single application, without penetrating deeper than\r\nordinary paint, forms an impervious coating to the wood-cells, which\r\nwould, without such covering, under external influences, soon become\r\nchannels of decay. This simple application then produces a sort of\r\ninstantaneous cauterization, and preserves from decay wounds caused\r\neither in pruning or by accident. The odor of coal-tar drives away\r\ninsects, or prevents them, by complete adherence to the wood, from\r\ninjuring it. After long and expensive experiments, the director of the\r\nparks of the city of Paris finally, in 1863, adopted coal-tar, in\r\npreference to other preparations used, for covering tree wounds. In the\r\ncase of stone fruit trees it should, however, be used with considerable\r\ncaution, especially on plum trees. It should not be allowed to\r\nneedlessly run down the trunk; and it is well to remember, that the more\r\nactive a remedy is the greater should be the care in its application.\r\nThe practice of leaving a short stump to an amputated branch, adopted by\r\nsome to prevent the loss of sap, although less objectionable in the case\r\nof coniferous trees than in that of others, should never be adopted.\r\nSuch stumps must be cut again the following year close to the trunk, or\r\ncushions of wood will form about their base, covering the trunk with\r\nprotuberances. These greatly injure the appearance and value of the\r\ntree, and necessitate, should it be found desirable, the removal, later\r\non, of such excrescences, causing wounds two or three times as large as\r\nan original cut close to the trunk would have made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TOMATO PACK OF 1883.\r\n\r\n\r\nThrough the co-operation of packers in all parts of the United States,\r\nthe American Grocer was enabled to present its annual statement of the\r\n1883 pack of tomatoes some weeks earlier than usual. Despite a cold,\r\nbackward spring, unusually low temperature throughout the summer, with\r\ncool nights in August and September, drouth in some sections, early and\r\nsevere frosts in others, the trade is called upon to solve the question:\r\nCan the demand absorb a supply of three million cases?\r\n\r\nThe pack of 1883 is heavily in excess of that of 1882, due to an\r\nincrease in the number packers, and to an unusually heavy yield in New\r\nJersey and Delaware. In detail, the result in the different States is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n             Cases, two\r\n             doz. each.\r\nMaryland      1,450,000\r\nNew Jersey      612,703\r\nDelaware        156,391\r\nCalifornia      117,000\r\nOhio            112,000\r\nIndiana          90,000\r\nVirginia         75,000\r\nKansas           65,000\r\nNew York         59,344\r\nIowa             47,925\r\nMissouri         34,500\r\nMichigan         30,700\r\nMassachusetts    25,000\r\nCanada           20,000\r\nConnecticut      18,000\r\nIllinois         14,516\r\nPennsylvania     15,000\r\n              ---------\r\n   Total      2,943,579\r\n\r\nThe above total of 2,943,579 cases, of two dozen tins each represents\r\nseventy million, six hundred and forty-five thousand, eight hundred and\r\nninety-six cans, as the minimum quantity of canned tomatoes packed in\r\nthe United States this year.\r\n\r\nNever in recent years have the holdings of the jobbers been as light as\r\nat present. Undoubtedly there is an unusually large stock of tomatoes in\r\npackers' hands, but there are innumerable parties in all the great\r\ncenters of trade ready to take hold freely at 80 cents.\r\n\r\nAt no time has the stock of extra brands been equal to the inquiry, and\r\nhence we have seen the anomaly of a range in prices of from 80 cents to\r\n$1.40 per dozen. There is room for improvement in quality, as well as\r\nfor methods of marketing the large production of Harford county. A move\r\nin the right direction has been started by the forming of associations,\r\nwhich seek to build extensive warehouses and aid weak packers to carry\r\nstock, instead of forcing it upon a dull market.\r\n\r\nThree million cases or seventy-two million cans means a supply of only\r\none and two-fifths cans per capita per annum, or seven cans per annum\r\nfor every family of five persons. With tomatoes retailing from 8 to 15\r\ncents per can, the consumption could reach three times that quantity,\r\nand then each family would only find tomatoes upon its bill of fare once\r\nevery fortnight.\r\n\r\nWhile many packers have failed to secure a fair return for their work,\r\nothers have been well paid. Some few have made heavy losses, and will,\r\nin the future, be less inclined to bet against wet weather, drought and\r\nfrost.\r\n\r\nIf general business is good during the first half of 1884, The Grocer\r\ncan see no good reason why the stock of tomatoes should not go into\r\nconsumption between 85 cents and $1 per dozen for standards. Any marked\r\nadvance would be sure to check demand, and, therefore, low prices must\r\nrule if the stock is absorbed prior to the receipt of 1884 packing.\r\n\r\nThe year closes with Maryland packed obtainable from 75 to 85 cents; New\r\nJersey and Delaware, 90 to 95 cents; fancy brands, $1.10 to $1.35,\r\ndelivered on dock in New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSWEATING APPLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the Popular Science News, apples do not sweat after they\r\nare gathered in the autumn. Here is an account of what takes place with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe skin of a sound apple is practically a protective covering, and\r\ndesigned for a two-fold purpose: first, to prevent the ingress of air\r\nand moisture to the tender cellular structure of the fruit; and, second,\r\nto prevent the loss of juices by exudation. There is no such process as\r\nsweating in fruits. When men or animals sweat, they become covered with\r\nmoisture passing through the skin; when an apple becomes covered with\r\nmoisture, it is due to condensation of moisture from without. Apples\r\ntaken from trees in a cool day remain at the temperature of the air\r\nuntil a change to a higher temperature occurs, and then condensation of\r\nmoisture from the warmer air circulating around the fruit occurs, just\r\nas moisture gathers upon the outside of an ice-pitcher in summer. This\r\nexplains the whole matter; and the vulgar notion of fruits \"sweating\"\r\nshould be dispelled from the mind.\r\n\r\nIt is almost impossible to gather apples under such conditions of\r\ntemperature that they will not condense moisture after being placed in\r\nbarrels. It would be better if this result could be avoided, as dryness\r\nof fruit is essential to its protracted keeping.\r\n\r\nOur northern autumns are characterized by changes from hot to cold, and\r\nthese occur suddenly. The days are hot, and the nights cool, and this\r\nfavors condensation. Apples picked on a moderately cool day, and placed\r\nin a moderately cool shed, protected from the sun, will not gather\r\nmoisture, and this is the best method to pursue when practicable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRUNINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. N. Atwell, one of the Michigan commissioners, whose duty it is to\r\nlook after the peach districts of that State and check if possible the\r\nravages of the destructive disease known as \"yellows,\" claims that there\r\nis no known remedy, and that the only safe plan is to uproot and burn\r\nthe trees upon the first appearance of the disease.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf you are going to set a new orchard this spring, remember that it is\r\nan excellent thing to prepare a plan of the orchard, showing the\r\nposition of each tree, its variety, etc. If a tree dies it can be\r\nreplaced by one of the same sort. Some fruit-raisers keep a book in\r\nwhich they register the age and variety of every tree in the orchard,\r\ntogether with any items in regard to their grafting, productiveness,\r\ntreatment, etc., which are thought to be desirable.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCor. California Rural Press: The first generation of codling moth begins\r\nto fly about the first of May.

W. W. Meech writes that he\r\nhas seen in several papers of high standing \"the beetle Saperdabivitati,\r\nparent of the borer,\" described as a \"a miller\"--\"a mistake very\r\nmisleading to those who are seeking knowledge of insect pests.\" He adds\r\nthat among hundreds of quince trees growing he has had but three touched\r\nby this enemy in eight years. He simply takes the precaution to keep\r\ngrass and weeds away from the collar of the tree, \"so that there is no\r\nconvenient harbor for the beetle to hide in while at the secret work of\r\negg-laying.\" He thinks a wrap of \"petroleum paper around the collar\"\r\nwould be found a preventive, as it is not only disagreeable but hinders\r\naccess to the place where the eggs are deposited. It is an unfortunate\r\nerror to refer to a beetle as a moth. It would be better if all would\r\nrecognize the distinction between \"bug\" and \"beetle,\" and between\r\n\"worms\" and \"larva,\" in writing popular articles. I notice that some of\r\nthe editors of medical journals are referring to bacteria as \"bugs.\"\r\nSurely reform is needed. I am not so sure of Mr. Meech's remedy. I\r\nimagine that fortune, not his pains, is to be thanked for his grubless\r\ntrees. I have known this borer to do very serious mischief where the\r\nmost perfect culture was practised. The caustic wash is much safer than\r\na petroleum wrap. The eggs are often laid high up on the trunk or even\r\non the branches. Nothing is better for the borers than the soap and\r\ncarbolic acid mixture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFLORICULTURE.\r\n\r\nGleanings by an Old Florist.\r\n\r\n\r\nSMILAX AND ITS USES.\r\n\r\nSmilax, as now used by florists, is but a very recent affair. Although\r\nintroduced first into Europe from the Cape of Good Hope as early as\r\n1702, it remained for the florist of our time to find out its great\r\nadaptability for decoration and other uses in his art or calling. To\r\nBoston florists belong the credit of its first extensive culture and\r\nuse, and for several years they may be said to have had the monopoly of\r\nits trade, and Boston smilax, along with Boston tea roses, which was\r\npre-eminently the variety called the Bon Silene, was, for years, shipped\r\nto this and other cities. It is scarcely a decade of years ago, in this\r\ncity, when a batch of one hundred strings could not be bought here,\r\nhome-grown; now there would be no difficulty in getting thousands. Like\r\neverything else of like character, the first introducers reaped a golden\r\nharvest, so far as price is concerned, having often obtained a dollar a\r\nstring; while now, the standard price, even in mid winter, is $2 per\r\ndozen, and often in quantity, it can be obtained at less. But where\r\nthere was one string used then, there are now thousands. In olden times\r\nthe florist was often put to his wits to find material to go around his\r\nmade-up pieces and for relief as a green; now, everything green is\r\nsmilax, and it must be confessed, that with the choice ferns, begonia\r\nleaves, and the like, that he used to have to prepare with, his work\r\nthen was really often in better taste, so far as relief to flowers is\r\nconcerned, with the old material than the new.\r\n\r\nBut for the purpose of festooning buildings, churches, and the like,\r\nsmilax is by all odds the very thing wanted, and as much ahead of the\r\nold-time evergreen wreathing, that we had to use, as the methods now in\r\nuse for obtaining cut flowers are ahead of the old. It is hard to say\r\nwhat the florist could do without smilax, so indispensable has it\r\nbecome. There are now probably twenty of the principal growers of this\r\ncity that have at least one house in smilax, who will cut not less than\r\nthree thousand strings in a winter, while of the balance of smaller fry\r\nenough to make up the total to 100,000 strings per year. In times of\r\nscarcity of material, it is cut not over three feet long; again, when\r\nthe supply exceeds the demand, the buyer will often get it six to nine\r\nfeet long, and at a lower price than he can buy the short--supply and\r\ndemand ruling price, as a rule, between $1 and $3 per dozen.\r\n\r\nThe plant now under consideration is called, botanically, Myrsiphyllum\r\nasparagoides; by common usage it is called smilax, although not even a\r\nmember of the true smilax family, some of which are natives of this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe plant seeds readily, hence every one who grows smilax may, by\r\nleaving two or three strings uncut, grow his own seed; it is then sure\r\nto be fresh--which is sometimes not the case when purchased. The seed is\r\nmore likely to germinate if soaked twelve hours in warm water or milk\r\nbefore sowing.\r\n\r\nA bed may be formed any time of the year, but the usual custom is to\r\nprepare it so as to be ready to cut, say, in the fall, for the first\r\ntime. Take a pan or shallow box and sow the seed any time during the\r\nwinter before March. When well up, so they can be handled, transplant\r\ninto small pots, and from these shift into larger, say to three or four\r\ninch pots. Keep the shoots pinched back so as to form a stout, bushy\r\nplant. During winter they will require an artificial temperature of not\r\nless than 50 degrees. When summer comes they may be kept in the house or\r\nstand out of doors until the bed in which they are to grow is ready.\r\nThis may be prepared any time most desirable, but if to cut first in the\r\nfall, so manage it that they may have two or three months to perfect\r\ntheir growth.\r\n\r\nThe common practice is to give the whole house to the use of the plant,\r\nbut this may be varied at pleasure, growing either the center bunch, the\r\nfront bunch, or both, as may be desirable.\r\n\r\nThe best soil is decayed sod from a pasture enriched with cow manure. It\r\nrequires no benches to grow this plant; all that is necessary is to\r\ninclose the space designed by putting up boards one foot high to form a\r\ncoping to hold the soil. Into this the plants are set evenly over the\r\nentire space, in rows nine inches to one foot apart. At the time of\r\nplanting, a stake is driven into and even with the soil at each plant,\r\nbeing careful to have them in true lines both ways, and driven deep\r\nenough to be quite firm; on the top of this stake is driven a small nail\r\nor hook. Directly over each nail, in the rafter of the house, or a strip\r\nnailed to them for the purpose, is placed another nail, and between the\r\ntwo a cord similar to that used by druggists or the like--but green, if\r\npossible, in color, for obvious reasons--is stretched as taught as may\r\nbe, so that when finished the whole house or space used is occupied by\r\nthese naked strings, on which, as the growth proceeds, the plants\r\nentwine themselves. Some care will be required at first to get them\r\nstarted, after which they will usually push on themselves.\r\n\r\nThe most convenient height of the rafters above the soil is from four to\r\nten feet, which will give long enough strings, and, what is important\r\nfor quick growth, keep the plants when young not too far from the glass.\r\n\r\nIn planting, some make a difference of a month or two in the time, so\r\nthat the crop may not come in all at once; but usually the plants will\r\nvary some in their growth, and hence, by cutting the largest first, the\r\nsame result is obtained. If a heat of 55 degrees can be obtained as a\r\nminimum, and care is taken in keeping a moist, growing temperature, a\r\ncrop can be taken off every three months at least. So as soon as ready\r\nto cut and a market can be obtained for the crop, strings should be\r\nstrung again at once, leaving some of the smaller shoots when cutting\r\nfor a starter of the next crop. Like everything else, heavy cropping\r\nrequires heavy manuring, and hence a rich compost should be added to the\r\nsoil at each cutting.\r\n\r\nSome plant their beds fresh every year, others leave them longer. The\r\nroot is perennial in character, and consists of fleshy tubers, not\r\nunlike asparagus, and may be divided for the new beds; but the general\r\npractice is to grow new plants. Always beware of buying old, dry roots,\r\nas they will sometimes refuse to grow, even if they look green and\r\nfresh. With many, in cutting, the practice is to cut clear through at\r\nthe bottom, string and all, then by a deft movement of the hands the\r\nsmilax is slipped from the string which, with the addition of a foot or\r\ntwo to tie again, is at once ready for the next, while others bring to\r\nmarket string and all, these being simply matters of practice or\r\nconvenience.\r\n\r\n    EDGAR SANDERS.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWas Noah's voyage an arktic expedition?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR NEW CLUBBING LIST FOR 1884.\r\n\r\nTHE PRAIRIE FARMER IN CONNECTION WITH OTHER JOURNALS.\r\n\r\nWe offer more liberal terms than ever before to those who desire to\r\ntake, in connection with THE PRAIRIE FARMER, either of the following\r\nweekly or monthly periodicals.

It has kept pace with the progress and\r\ndevelopment of the country, holding its steady course through all these\r\nforty-three years, encouraging, counseling, and educating its thousands\r\nof readers. It has labored earnestly in the interest of all who are\r\nengaged in the rural industries of the country, and that it has labored\r\nsuccessfully is abundantly shown by the prominence and prestige it has\r\nachieved, and the hold it has upon the agricultural classes.\r\n\r\nIts managers are conscious from comparison with other journals of its\r\nclass, and from the uniform testimony of its readers, that it is\r\nforemost among the farm and home papers of the country. It will not be\r\npermitted to lose this proud position; we shall spare no efforts to\r\nmaintain its usefulness and make it indispensable to farmers,\r\nstock-raisers, feeders, dairymen, horticulturalists, gardeners, and all\r\nothers engaged in rural pursuits. It will enter upon its forty-fourth\r\nyear under auspices, in every point of view, more encouraging than ever\r\nbefore in its history. Its mission has always been, and will continue to\r\nbe--\r\n\r\nTo discuss the most approved practices in all agricultural and\r\nhorticultural pursuits.\r\n\r\nTo set forth the merits of the best breeds of domestic animals, and to\r\nelucidate the principles of correct breeding and management.\r\n\r\nTo further the work of agricultural and horticultural organization.\r\n\r\nTo advocate industrial education in the correct sense of the term.\r\n\r\nTo lead the van in the great contest of the people against monopolies\r\nand the unjust encroachments of capital.\r\n\r\nTo discuss the events and questions of the day without fear or favor.\r\n\r\nTo provide information concerning the public domain, Western soil,\r\nclimate, water, railroads, schools, churches, and society.\r\n\r\nTo answer inquiries on all manner of subjects coming within its sphere.\r\n\r\nTo furnish the latest and most important industrial news at home and\r\nabroad.\r\n\r\nTo give full and reliable crop, weather, and market reports.\r\n\r\nTo present the family with pure, choice, and interesting literature.\r\n\r\nTo amuse and instruct the young folks.\r\n\r\nTo gather and condense the general news of the day.\r\n\r\nTo be, in brief, an indispensable and unexceptionable farm and home\r\ncompanion for the people of the whole country.\r\n\r\nThe style and form of the paper are now exactly what they should be. The\r\npaper used is of superior quality. The type is bold and clear. The\r\nillustrations are superb. The departments are varied and carefully\r\narranged. The editorial force is large and capable. The list of\r\ncontributors is greatly increased, and embraces a stronger array of\r\ntalent than is employed on any similar paper in this country. We\r\nchallenge comparison with any agricultural journal in the land.\r\n\r\nTHE PRAIRIE FARMER is designed for all sections of the country. In\r\nentering upon the campaign of 1884, we urge all patrons and friends to\r\ncontinue their good works in extending the circulation of our paper. On\r\nour part we promise to leave nothing undone that it is possible for\r\nfaithful, earnest work--aided by money and every needed mechanical\r\nfacility--to do to make the paper in every respect still better than it\r\nhas ever been before.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSPECIAL NOTICE\r\n\r\nTo each Subscriber who will remit us $2.00 between now and February 1st,\r\n1884, we will mail a copy of THE PRAIRIE FARMER FOR ONE YEAR, AND ONE OF\r\nOUR NEW STANDARD TIME COMMERCIAL MAPS OF THE UNITED STATES AND\r\nCANADA--showing all the Counties, Railroads, and Principal Towns up to\r\ndate.

A. Goodman, of the Missouri State Horticultural Society\r\nwrites THE PRAIRIE FARMER that on the 5th of January the mercury at\r\nWestport, Wis., indicated 26 degrees below zero, the lowest point ever\r\nrecorded there. He adds: \"The peaches are killed, as are the\r\nblackberries. Cherries are injured very much and the raspberries also.\r\nThe dry September checked the growth of the berries and sun-burned them\r\nsome, and now the cold hurts them badly. Apples are all right yet and\r\nprospects for good crop are excellent.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt may be of interest to many readers to know that the I. & St. L. R. R.\r\nwill sell tickets from Indianapolis and intermediate points to St.\r\nLouis, to persons attending the meeting of the Mississippi Valley\r\nHorticultural Society, at one and one-third rates. Mr. Ragan informs us\r\nthat this is the only railroad line from central Indiana that offers a\r\nreduction of fare. The Missouri Pacific system of roads, including the\r\nWabash, and embracing about ten thousand miles of road, extending as far\r\nnorth and east as Chicago, Detroit and Toledo, and as far south and west\r\nas New Orleans, Galveston and El Paso, will return members in\r\nattendance, who have paid full fare over these lines, at one cent a\r\nmile, upon the certificate of the Secretary of the Society. The Chicago\r\n& Alton, C., B. & Q., Keokuk, St. L. & N. W., Chicago, B. & K. C.,\r\nIllinois Central, Cairo Short Line, and Hannibal & St. Joe roads will\r\nreturn members on the same terms. The Ohio & Mississippi will sell\r\ntickets to St. Louis and return at one and one-third fare, to members\r\nindorsed by the Secretary. The Louisville and Nashville will give\r\nreduced rates to members applying to its General Passenger Agent, C. P.\r\nAtmore, of Louisville, Ky.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WEALTH OF THE NATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Census Bureau and Bradstreet's agency have made from the most\r\naccurate examination possible an estimate of the wealth and business of\r\nthe nation: Aggregate wealth of the United States in 1880 was\r\n$43,642,000,000 (forty thousand and a half billions); the total amount\r\nof capital invested in business was $8,177,000,000 (over eight\r\nbillions); and the number of persons engaged in commercial business was\r\n703,828. Twenty-two per cent of all the business capital of the country\r\nis credited to the State of New York. Massachusetts ranks second,\r\nPennsylvania third, Ohio fourth, Illinois fifth, and Michigan sixth. The\r\naggregate business capital of these six States was $5,113,087,000,\r\nleaving to all the other States $3,063,923,000. The total recorded\r\nnumber of traders in the United States in June, 1880--those having\r\ndistinctive position in the commercial or industrial community--was\r\n703,328; a trifle over 40 per cent were in the Western States. For the\r\nUnited States as a whole the average amount of capital employed to each\r\nventure--as indicated by the aggregate of capital in the country\r\ninvested in trade (as explained in the table compiled from the\r\nforthcoming census work) and the total number of individuals, firms, and\r\ncorporations engaged in business--is, in round numbers, $11,600.\r\n\r\nThe wealth of the country is, or was June 1, 1880, distributed as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n                                                     Millions.\r\nFarms                                                  $10,197\r\nResidence and business real estate, capital employed\r\n  in business, including water-power                     9,881\r\nRailroads and equipment                                  5,536\r\nTelegraphs, shipping, and canals                           410\r\nLive stock, whether on or off farms, farming tools\r\n  and machinery                                          2,406\r\nHousehold furniture, paintings, books, clothing,\r\n  jewelry, household supplies of food, fuel,\r\n  etc.                                                   5,000\r\nMines (including petroleum wells) and quarries,\r\n  together with one-half of the annual product\r\n  reckoned as the average supply on hand                   780\r\nThree-quarters of the annual product of agriculture\r\n  and manufactures, and of the annual importation\r\n  of foreign goods, assumed to be the\r\n  average supply on hand                                 6,160\r\nChurches, schools, asylums, public buildings of\r\n  all kinds, and other real estate exempt from\r\n  taxation                                               2,000\r\nSpecie                                                     612\r\nMiscellaneous items, including tools of mechanics          650\r\n                                                       -------\r\n      Total                                            $43,642\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that the farms of the United States comprise nearly\r\none-fourth of its entire wealth. They are worth nearly double the\r\ncombined capital and equipments of all the railroads, telegraphs,\r\nshipping, and canals; more than double all the household furniture,\r\npaintings, books, clothing, jewelry, and supplies of food, fuel, etc.\r\nThe live stock is more valuable than all the church property, school\r\nhouses, asylums, and public buildings of all kinds; more than all the\r\nmines, telegraph companies, shipping, and canals combined. It would take\r\nmore than three times as much \"hard\" money as the nation possesses to\r\npurchase all these domestic animals. The farms and live stock together\r\nexceed the value of any two other interests in the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTAGIOUS ANIMAL DISEASES.\r\n\r\n\r\nCongress seems bound to act at once upon the question of protection to\r\ndomestic animals from contagious diseases. The pressure brought to bear\r\nupon members is enormous, and cannot be ignored. The action of European\r\nStates on swine importation from America, the restrictions on the\r\nlanding of American cattle in England, and the strong effort being made\r\nthere to prohibit their introduction altogether, the known existence of\r\npleuro-pneumonia in several of the Atlantic States, the unceasing clamor\r\nof our shippers and growers of live stock, all conspire to open the eyes\r\nof the average Congressman to the fact that something must be done. Mr.\r\nSingleton, of Illinois, must be something above or below the average\r\nCongressman, if the report is correct that he does not believe\r\npleuro-pneumonia exists anywhere within the borders of the United\r\nStates, and that he is willing to back his non-belief by a thousand\r\ndollars forfeit, if an animal suffering from the disease can be shown\r\nhim. The former owner of Silver Heels, and breeder of fine horses and\r\ncattle at his Quincy farm, must have his eyes shaded and his ears\r\nobstructed by that broad brimmed hat, that has so long covered his\r\nsilvered head and marble brow. \"The world do move,\" nevertheless, and\r\npleuro-pneumonia does prevail in this country to such an extent as to\r\nfurnish a reasonable excuse for unfriendly legislation abroad, and we\r\ngain nothing by denying the fact, the Allerton and Singleton assertions\r\nto the contrary, notwithstanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIOWA STATE FAIR.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the late meeting of the Iowa State Agricultural Society, President\r\nSmith strongly advocated the permanent location of the State Fair. He\r\nthought it had been hawked about long enough for the purpose of giving\r\ndifferent cities a chance to skin the people. The Legislature should aid\r\nthe society in purchasing grounds. Ample ground should be purchased, as\r\nthe fair is growing, and they should not be governed solely by our\r\npresent demands. Secretary Shaffer touched briefly on the weather of\r\nlast summer, the acreage and yield of crops, the demonstration of the\r\nfutility of trying to acclimatize Southern seed-corn in the North, and\r\nthe appointment of a State entomologist. He thought the State should\r\nassist the society in distributing its publications. The improvement of\r\nthe Mississippi river was briefly handled. The state of the corn during\r\nthe past year, the seeding, the yield, etc., were summarized by months.\r\nThe corn crop was a failure. The sorghum industry in its various\r\nbearings was discussed. Iowa will yet, he said, produce its own sugar.\r\nThe question was raised whether the State should not encourage the\r\ngrowth of Northern cane. The sheep industry and its peril from worthless\r\ndogs was duly treated. This society was the first to insist on the\r\nnecessity of Legislation on this subject looking to the extermination of\r\nworthless dogs. The society proceeded to locate the fair for the next\r\nyear. Des Moines offered the present grounds for 10 per cent of the gate\r\nmoney. Dubuque offered free grounds and $2,500 in money. The first\r\nballot resulted in seventy-one votes for Des Moines and twenty-three for\r\nDubuque. Officers were elected as follows: President, William L. Smith,\r\nof Oskalossa; Vice-President, H. C. Wheeler, of Sac; Secretary, John\r\nShaffer, of Fairfield; Treasurer, George H. Marsh, of Des Moines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTILL ANOTHER FAT STOCK SHOW.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the meeting of the Indiana State Board of Agriculture last week, it\r\nwas decided to hold a Fat Stock Show at Indianapolis some time in\r\nDecember of the present year. Liberal premiums will be offered. The\r\nmatter elicited a discussion of considerable length, and it was\r\ngenerally believed that the show, if properly managed, could be made a\r\nsuccess. Even if it failed to realize expenses the first year, the\r\nexhibition would be incalculably beneficial to the State. The election\r\nof new members to the Board resulted as follows: First district, Robert\r\nMitchell, of Gibson county; Second, Samuel Hargrave, of Pike; Third, J.\r\nQ. A. Seig, of Harrison; Fourth, W. B. Seward, of Monroe; Eighth, W. S.\r\nDungan, of Johnson; Fourteenth, L. B. Custer, of Cass; Fifteenth, W. A.\r\nBanks, of La Porte; Sixteenth, R. M. Lockhart, of DeKalb.\r\n\r\nThree Fat Stock Shows in the West! True, the success of the Chicago\r\nexhibit is having a wide influence. The live stock interests of the\r\ncountry are fully awakened to the important results from these shows.\r\nThey are, indeed, educators of the highest character, and they stimulate\r\nto excellence unthought of by most farmers, ten years ago. Chicago,\r\nKansas City, Toronto, and now Indianapolis! Is there not room for a\r\nsimilar exhibition in the great stock State of Iowa? Why do we not hear\r\nfrom West Liberty or Cedar Rapids?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ANSWERED.\r\n\r\n\r\nF. J. ST. CLAIR, URSA, ILL.--Who was the first President to issue a\r\nThanksgiving Proclamation?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--Washington, in 1798, on the adoption by the States of the\r\nConstitution of the United States.\r\n\r\nSUBSCRIBER, PEOTONE, ILL.--How many kinds of soils are there, and what\r\ncrops are best suited to bottom and what to upland soils?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--There are really but two soils, agriculturally considered,\r\nfertile soils and barren soils. Generally speaking, fertile soils are\r\nthe result of the disintegration of mechanical forces and chemical\r\nagencies of limestone rocks; and barren soils--sandy soils--are produced\r\nby similar means, from rocks largely or wholly composed of silex or\r\nquartz. The mixture of these two give rise to soils of an infinite\r\nvariety, almost, having many differing degrees of fertility, down to\r\nbarrenness. But you have practically but one soil to deal with, a true\r\nlimestone soil of high fertility, which has received considerable\r\naccessions from silicious rocks. Your bottom lands do not differ\r\nmaterially from the upland, except that the former have received\r\nconsiderable vegetable matter, which the latter have lost. For the\r\nlowlands, corn, grass, and potatoes are the best crops; for the\r\nhighlands, the small grains, sorghum, beans, etc. But provide as much\r\nvegetable matter for the highlands as your lowlands possess, and make\r\nthe sum of mixture in both alike, and your highlands will grow corn,\r\ngrass, and potatoes as well as the low.\r\n\r\nCHARLES VAN METER, SPRINGFIELD, MO.--What is the best work on Grape\r\nCulture? My means are small, and I can not, of course, buy a work\r\ncosting ten or twelve dollars, however good it may be. Recommend, for\r\nthis latitude, something good and cheap.\r\n\r\nANSWER.--For your needs you will find nothing better than Hussman's\r\nGrapes and Wine, a single volume, which will be sent you from THE\r\nPRAIRIE FARMER office, on remittance of $1.50. But there is something\r\ncheaper still, and very good, indeed, but covering different grounds\r\nfrom Hussman. The Grape Catalogue of Bush & Son & Meissner. You may\r\nobtain it by sending twenty-five cents to Bush & Son & Meissner,\r\nBushberg, Missouri.\r\n\r\nCONSTANT READER, CHICAGO, ILL.--I am thinking of going down, one of\r\nthese days, to Florida, with a view to go into oranges and make more\r\nmoney than I have, or lose it all. I have read a good deal about the\r\nseductive business, in Florida, though but little of the details of\r\ncultivation in other countries. Tell me where I can find something about\r\nhow they manage in Spain and the south of Europe.\r\n\r\nANSWER.--Most of the really valuable works on this subject are in\r\nforeign languages--French, Spanish, or Italian. However, for a wonder, a\r\nlate publication of the Department of State, at Washington--Reports from\r\nthe consuls of the United States, No. 33--contains a valuable and\r\nlengthy paper on Orange Growing at Valencia, Spain, contributed by the\r\nconsul there, which you may perhaps obtain through your member of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nJ. D. SLADE, COLUMBUS, GA.--I am interested in a large plantation near\r\nthis city with a friend who is a practical farmer. We have decided to\r\nabandon the planting of cotton to a great extent and adopt some other\r\ncrops. Having concluded to try the castor bean, I wish to ask some\r\ninformation. 1. Will you give me the names of parties engaged in the\r\ncultivation of the crop in Illinois and Wisconsin? 2. Where can I get\r\nthe beans for planting? 3. Describe the soil, mode of preparation,\r\nplanting, and cultivation, and give me such other information as we may\r\nneed.\r\n\r\nANSWER.--1. Winter wheat and corn have, to a very large extent, taken\r\nthe place of castor beans and tobacco in the agriculture of Southern\r\nIllinois. As for Wisconsin, we question whether a bushel of castor beans\r\nwas grown there last year. The two sections where they are now mostly\r\ncultivated are in Southwestern Missouri, by the old settlers, and in\r\nMiddle and Southern Kansas, by the first comers. For information on the\r\nwhole subject, write the Secretary of the Kansas State Board of\r\nAgriculture for the quarterly report issued two or three years ago,\r\nwhich was mostly devoted to castor-bean culture. The Secretary's address\r\nis Topeka, Kansas. 2. Of the Plant Seed Company, St. Louis, and also\r\nvaluable information--that city being the chief market for the castor\r\nbeans. 3. The soil best suited to the crop is a light, rich, sandy loam,\r\nthough any dry and fertile soil will yield good crops. For some reason\r\nnot clearly understood, the castor bean has been found a powerful and\r\nenergetic agent in improving some, if not all soils, the experience in\r\nKansas being, that land which previously refused to yield good crops of\r\nwheat or corn either, after being cultivated two or three years in\r\ncastor beans has borne great crops. This has been attributed to the\r\ncompleteness and the long time the crop shades the ground, and also to\r\nthe long tap root of the plant, which makes it a crop of all others,\r\nsuited to dry soils, and hot climate. After preparing the land as for\r\ncorn, it should be laid off so the plants will stand, for your latitude,\r\nfive feet each way. Three or four seeds are usually planted, but when\r\nthe beans are five to six inches high, and out of the way of cut-worms,\r\nthey are thinned to one. The cultivation is after the manner of Indian\r\ncorn, and the planting should be at the same time. The beans for your\r\nlatitude will begin to ripen late in July, and continue to the end of\r\nthe season, when the plants are killed by severe frosts, light frosts\r\ndoing scarcely any damage. In harvesting, a spot of hard ground is\r\nprepared and the pods as gathered are thrown on the ground and dried out\r\nin the sun. And here is where the trouble with making a successful and\r\nprofitable crop comes in. The beans must be kept in the dry from the\r\ntime of gathering the pods--one soaking rain always seriously damaging,\r\nand frequently destroying the merchantable value of so much of the\r\nharvest as happens to be on the ground. As in the case of broom corn,\r\nthe hot, dry, and protracted late summer and fall months of that State,\r\nafford the Kansas farmer something like a monopoly of the castor bean\r\ncrop. It is nevertheless giving place to corn and wheat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM CHAMPAIGN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe snow continues to accumulate, the last having fallen before midnight\r\nthe 11th. There were only about two inches, but it is drifting this\r\nmorning, for all it is worth, before a gale from the West. The first and\r\nsecond snows stay where they were put at first, but the subsequent ones\r\nare in drifts or scattered all abroad, in the many snows and the\r\nexcellence of the sleighing, this winter resembles '78-'79, but there is\r\nmore snow and the temperature is very much more severe. I suppose there\r\nis well-nigh eighteen inches now on the ground, something quite unusual\r\nin this latitude. Let us hope it will stay sometime longer yet, and save\r\nthe fall wheat.\r\n\r\nThe intensely cold weather of last week was rough on stock of all kinds\r\nand in all conditions, and particularly hard on that portion having\r\nshort rations. But I have seen many worse storms and much harder weather\r\nfor stock; none however in which the fruits, small or large, suffered\r\nworse. At least that is the general judgment at the present. Peach buds\r\nare killed of course, and it will be lucky if the trees have escaped.\r\nAll blackberries, but the Snyder, are dead down to the snow line--and\r\nsome think the Snyder has not escaped, for reasons given further on.\r\nExaminations made of the buds of Bartlett, Duchess, Howell, Tyson,\r\nBigarreau, Seckel, Buffum, Easter Buerre, and others yesterday, showed\r\nthem all to be about equally frosted and blackened, and probably\r\ndestroyed. Last year our pears suffered a good deal from the sleet of\r\nthe second of February, which clung to the trees ten days, and the crop\r\nwas a light one. This year, if appearances can be trusted, there will be\r\nless. In the many intense freezes of the last twenty-five years, I have\r\nnever known pear buds to be seriously injured; last year being a marked\r\nexception and this still more so. Hardy grapes have probably suffered as\r\nmuch, and the tender varieties are completely done for. How well the May\r\ncherry has resisted the low temperature remains to be seen. As for the\r\nsweet cherries, it is probably the end of them.\r\n\r\nThere were buds set for an unusually abundant crop of apples in\r\n1884--the Presidential year. The hardy varieties have escaped material\r\ndamage, no doubt, but some of the tender Eastern varieties, like the\r\nBaldwin, Roxbury Russet, in all reasonable probability, have not only\r\nlost their buds but their lives also.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe disasters following the very low temperature of last week have no\r\ndoubt been increased by the immaturity of the wood, due to the cool,\r\nmoist summer. If summers like those of 1882-83 are not warm enough to\r\nripen the corn crop, buds and wood of fruit trees will not acquire a\r\nmaturity that resists intense cold as we see by our experience with\r\npears, grapes, and peaches in the fruit season of 1883, and which is\r\nalmost sure to be repeated with aggravations in 1884. Possibly the\r\nground being but lightly frozen and protected by a good coat of snow,\r\nmay save the apple trees and others from great disaster following thirty\r\nto thirty-five degrees below zero, when falling on half ripened wood,\r\nbut the reasonable fear is that orchards on high land in Northern and\r\nCentral Illinois, have been damaged more than last year. If so perhaps\r\nit were better after all, since it will open the eyes of a great many to\r\nthe mistakes in location heretofore made, and lead them to put out\r\nfuture orchards where they ought to be.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf my word of warning could reach those engaged in taking measures at\r\nWashington to prevent the spread of epidemic and infectious diseases in\r\nour stock, it would be \"go slow.\" If the wishes of a few veterinarians\r\nare met and the demands of a raft of pauper lawyers and politicians are\r\ncomplied with, it will result in the creation of a half dozen\r\ncommissions. Each one of them, as previous ones have done, will find\r\nsufficient reason for their continuance and reports will be made that\r\nhalf the live stock in the country, South and West, is either in danger\r\nfrom or suffering under some of the many forms of epidemic or infectious\r\ndiseases--and by the way, what justice is there in putting Detmers out\r\nof the way, and clinging to Salmon and Laws, both of whom indorsed\r\nnearly every thing the former did? Beware of commissions, and above all\r\nof putting men upon them whose bread and butter is of more consequence\r\nto them than the stock interest, vast as it is.\r\n\r\n    B. F. J.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAYSIDE NOTES.\r\n\r\nBY A MAN OF THE PRAIRIE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the 2,500,000 packages of seeds distributed by the United States\r\nAgricultural Department during last year more than 2,000,000 packages\r\nwere furnished to Congressmen, and I notice that some of the papers are\r\nmaking unfavorable comments on the fact. Now I do not discover anything\r\nthat seems to me radically wrong in this practice of the Department of\r\nAgriculture, or rather in the instructions under which the practice\r\nprevails. There are some men, mostly seedsmen, and some publishers,\r\nmostly those interested in securing patronage through seed premiums, or\r\nwhich are run in the interest of seed dealers, who grumble a great deal\r\nabout this matter, and who sneer at the department and derisively call\r\nit the \"Government seed store.\" But I imagine if the public was\r\nthoroughly informed of the good the department has done by its seed\r\ndistributions, it would have a great deal better opinion of this branch\r\nthan it now has, and I wish Mr. Dodge, or some other efficient man, who\r\nknows all about it from the beginning would give to the country a\r\ncomplete history of what has been done in the way of introducing and\r\ndisseminating new seeds, plants, and cuttings. I believe if the whole\r\ntruth were told it would put an end to ridicule and denunciation. I am\r\naware that there have been some things connected with this work that\r\nwere not exactly correct. There may have been some helping of friends in\r\nthe purchase of seeds; there may have been some noxious weed seeds sent\r\nout to the detriment of the country; Congressmen may have used their\r\nquota of seeds for the purpose of keeping themselves solid with their\r\nconstituents. But, after all, it is my candid opinion the seed\r\ndistributing branch of the department has been an untold blessing to the\r\nfarmers of this country. As to this matter of giving a large proportion\r\nof the seeds to Congressmen, I have not much fault to find about that\r\neither, though perhaps a better system of distribution might be devised.\r\nI have yet to learn that an application to a Congressman for seed has\r\nbeen disregarded, if the seeds were to be had, whether that application\r\ncame from a political friend or a political foe. And I do wish that\r\nfarmers generally would make more frequent application to the members\r\nfrom their respective districts than they do. It will be money in their\r\npockets if they will keep posted in what the department has to\r\ndistribute which is valuable, or new and promising, and solicit samples\r\neither from Congressmen or direct from the Commissioner of Agriculture.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Put your thumb down there,\" said an experienced orchardist to me the\r\nother day. We were talking about the recently started theory that the\r\nbest bearing orchards are to be found on the low lands of the prairies.\r\n\"You just wait and see if these brag orchards ever bear another crop! It\r\nwill be as it was after the severe winter of 1874 and '75, when the\r\nfollowing autumn many of our orchards bore so profusely. The succeeding\r\nyear the majority of the trees were as dead as smelts, and the balance\r\nnever had vigor enough afterward to produce a decent crop. Once before,\"\r\nsaid he, \"we had a similar experience in Illinois. Put your thumb down\r\nat this place and watch for results. Do not say anything about this in\r\nyour Wayside Blusterings, at least as coming from me,\" and of course I\r\ndon't. But I wanted the readers of THE PRAIRIE FARMER to help me watch\r\nwith fear and trembling for the fulfillment of this horticultural\r\nprophesy, so I straightway make a note of it and ask you all to \"put\r\nyour thumbs down here\" and wait. My friend's theory is that the severe\r\ncold of last winter destroyed a large portion of the roots of these\r\ntrees; that the root pruning caused the extra fruitfulness, but proved\r\ntoo severe for the vitality of the trees to withstand, and that next\r\nyear the bulk of the trees will not leaf out at all; and further that\r\nthe old theory as taught by Kennecott, Whitney, Edwards, and the rest of\r\nthe \"fathers,\" that apple trees cannot thrive with wet feet, was the\r\ncorrect theory then and is the correct theory now. He would still plant\r\non high, well drained land.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy neighbor up at the \"Corners\" has a large flock of grade Cotswold\r\nsheep--Cotswolds crossed on large native Merinos. He keeps them to\r\nproduce early lambs for the Chicago market. For the last three or four\r\nyears he has received, on an average, four dollars per head for his\r\nlambs, taken at his farm. It is a profitable and pleasant sort of\r\nfarming. Some day I may tell how he manages, in detail.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nREMEMBER _that_ $2.00 _pays for_ THE PRAIRIE FARMER _one year, and the\r\nsubscriber gets a copy of_ THE PRAIRIE FARMER COUNTY MAP OF THE UNITED\r\nSTATES, FREE! _This is the most liberal offer ever made by any\r\nfirst-class weekly agricultural paper in this country._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nPOULTRY NOTES.\r\n\r\nPoultry-Raisers. Write for Your Paper.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHICKEN CHAT.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet me see--it was sometime during the month of December that the \"Man\r\nof the Prairie\" went wandering all over the village, and even scoured\r\nthe country round about the village in search of an extra dozen eggs,\r\nand went home mad, and, man fashion, threatened to kill off every hen on\r\nthe place if they didn't proceed to do their duty like hens and fellow\r\ncitizens. It was also during that same December that the fifty Plymouth\r\nRock hens that we are wintering in the barn cellar, laid, regardless of\r\nthe weather, 736 eggs--an average of nearly fifteen eggs apiece.\r\n\r\n\"Is it a fact that the corn is too poor for manufacture into eggs?\"\r\n\r\nI don't know anything about the corn in your locality, but I do know\r\nthat our Plymouth Rocks had whole corn for supper exactly thirty-one\r\nnights during the month of December--not Western corn, but sound,\r\nwell-ripened, Northern corn, that sells in our market for twenty cents\r\nmore per bushel than Western corn. I also know that hens fed through the\r\nwinter on corn alone will not lay enough to pay for the corn, but in our\r\nclimate the poultry-raiser may feed corn profitably fully one-half the\r\ntime. When the morning feed consists of cooked vegetable and bran or\r\nshorts, and the noon meal of oats or buckwheat, the supper may be of\r\ncorn. I believe the analytical fellows tell us that corn won't make\r\neggs, and I am sure I don't know whether it will or not, and I don't\r\nmuch care; but I know that hens will eat corn, when they can get it, in\r\npreference to any other grain, and I know that it \"stands by\" better\r\nthan anything else, and that it is a heat-producing grain, and\r\nconsequently just the thing to feed when the days are short and the\r\nnights long, and the mercury fooling around 30 degrees below zero. Hens\r\nneed something besides egg material; they must have food to keep up the\r\nbody heat, and the poultry-raiser who feeds no corn in winter blunders\r\njust as badly as the one who feeds all corn.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTalking about corn for fowls reminds me that the agricultural papers are\r\nfull of wails from farmers who were taken in last season on seed corn.\r\nIf they had followed the plan of an old farmer of my acquaintance they\r\nwould not now be obliged to mourn a corn crop cut off by frost. When\r\nthis old chap went to farming forty years ago he bought a peck of seed\r\ncorn of the Northern yellow flint variety, and as he \"don't believe in\r\nrunning after all the new seeds that are advertised in the papers,\" he\r\nis still raising the same variety--only it ripens some three weeks\r\nearlier than it did then. Every fall he does through his field and\r\nselects his seed corn from the best of the earliest ripened ears; when\r\nthese ears are husked one or two husks are left on each ear, and then\r\nthe husks, with the ears attached, are braided together until there are\r\nfifteen or twenty ears in a string. These strings of seed corn are hung\r\nup in the sun for a fortnight or so, and then hung from the rafters in a\r\ncool, dry loft over the wood-shed; there it remains till seed time comes\r\nagain, and it never fails to grow.\r\n\r\n    FANNY FIELD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBUSINESS STILL RUNNING.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"My own hens closed out business six weeks ago,\" not long since said\r\n\"Man of the Prairie.\" He mentioned also, that he had not much faith in\r\npure bred poultry. Now he severely complains that no eggs can be found\r\namong the farmers nor in village stores. I will not say that pure\r\nstrains of poultry are better layers than common, but, when one pays a\r\ngood price for poultry, it is an incentive to provide good shelter and\r\nbestow upon them some manifestations of interest which would not be done\r\nwith the common fowls. Herein may lay in part the secret of better\r\nreturns from pure strains.\r\n\r\nYears ago our chickens 'closed out business' for several months. Of late\r\nthis procedure is unknown. We crossed our best common hens with Plymouth\r\nRock stock, paying a good price. We furnished comfortable quarters, gave\r\nvariety of feed, and at present writing the lady-like biddies furnish\r\nenough eggs for our own use and some to sell to stores and neighbors.\r\n\r\nWe still have a few common hens (not caring to have all pure) yet we\r\nfind that with same care and attention, the purer strains give best\r\nreturns.\r\n\r\nSkeptical, like a good many others, we were loth to experiment. Thanks\r\nto Fanny Field for her wise and instructive poultry writings. In a\r\nrecent number she seemed to be in doubt whether her writings were heeded\r\nor doing any one good. Let me say in behalf of myself and a few others,\r\nthat a few married ladies now have pin money by following her\r\ninstructions, who, before, had to go to their lords (husbands) when they\r\nwanted a little money, which was sometimes begrudgingly given, and often\r\ntimes not at all.\r\n\r\n    BACHELOR & MAID.\r\n        COUNCIL BLUFFS, IOWA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE APIARY.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BEST HIVE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn answer to many inquiries as to the best hive, we will here state that\r\nis a mere matter of choice. Many good movable frame hives are now in\r\nuse, free from patents, and while we prefer the Langstroth, there may be\r\nothers just as good.\r\n\r\nApiarists differ as to what constitutes the best hive. Novices in bee\r\nculture generally think that they can invent a better hive than any in\r\nuse, but after trying their invention for awhile, conclude that they are\r\nnot as wise as they thought they were. Many hives are patented yearly by\r\npersons ignorant of the nature of the honey-bee, and few, if any, are\r\nreceived with favor by intelligent apiarists.\r\n\r\nThe requisites for a good hive are durability, simplicity, ease of\r\nconstruction and of working, and pleasing to the eye. We think the\r\nLangstroth embodies these. It was invented by the father of modern\r\nbee-culture. He gave to the world the movable frame; without its use, we\r\nmight as well keep our bees in hollow logs, as our fathers did.\r\nDifferent sizes of movable frames are now in use, but two-thirds of the\r\napiarists prefer the Langstroth.\r\n\r\nUpon many farms, bees may be found in salt barrels, nail-kegs, etc.,\r\ndoing little good for their owner, while if they were put into hives,\r\nwhere the surplus could be obtained in good shape, they would become a\r\nsource of income. Specialists either manufacture their own hives, or buy\r\nthem in the flat, in the lumber region. As the farmer may need but a few\r\nhives, he may find leisure in winter to make them.\r\n\r\nEvery farmer needs a workshop, and if he has none, should provide\r\nhimself with one. It need not be large, and can be made quite\r\ninexpensively. In his barn, if it is large, partition off a room for a\r\nworkshop 12 × 14 feet, and if he not be blessed with a good large barn,\r\nwhy a thousand feet of common boards, and a load of good stout saplings,\r\nwith a little mechanical skill and some muscle, will provide a very good\r\nfarm workshop.\r\n\r\nGet a few tools, such as a saw, square, plane, hatchet, a brace, and a\r\nfew bits, and before twelve months pass away you will wonder how you\r\never managed to do without one before; many a singletree or doubletree\r\ncan be made, or broken implements repaired during leisure, or the rainy\r\ndays of late winter or spring, and the boys will go there to try their\r\nhands, and develop their mechanical skill; exercising both brain and\r\nmuscle. Remember that the school of industry is second to no university\r\nin the land.\r\n\r\nNow for the hives; in the first place you need a pattern. Purchase of\r\nsome dealer or manufacturer of apiarian supplies, a good Langstroth hive\r\ncomplete with section boxes. Then get a couple of hundred feet (more or\r\nless) of ten inch stock boards, mill dressed on both sides, then with\r\nyour pattern hive, workshop, and tools, you are master of the situation.\r\nAfter your hives are made, don't forget to paint them; it is economy to\r\npaint hives as well as dwelling houses.\r\n\r\n\r\nLANGSTROTH HIVE.\r\n\r\nFor the benefit of those who may not be able to obtain a pattern hive,\r\nor frame, we will give the dimensions. The sides of the Langstroth hive\r\nare 10 inches wide, by 23 inches long, the ends are 12 inches long, the\r\nback end the same width as the sides; front end, 3/8 inches narrower,\r\nand recesses or sets back 3-3/8 inches from portico, all 7/8 inches\r\nthick. The Langstroth frame is 17-1/4 × 9-1/4 inches outside measure.\r\nThe length of top bar of frame is 19-1/4 inches, the frame stuff is all\r\n7/8 wide, the top bar is 5/8 × 7/8, and is V shaped on the under side\r\nfor a comb guide--the upright pieces 1/2 × 7/8, the bottom pieces\r\n1/4 × 7/8.\r\n\r\nThe above are the dimensions of an eight frame hive. Strips 1/4 × 7/8\r\ninches are nailed on the outside of the hive 1/4 inch from the upper\r\nedge, and the cap or upper hive rests upon them. We make the cap 22-1/8\r\ninches long by 13-7/8 inches wide in the clear, and ten inches high.\r\n\r\nSome apiarists omit the porticos, but we like them, and the bees appear\r\nto enjoy them. Right angled triangle blocks, made right and left, are\r\nused to regulate the entrance. By changing the position of these blocks\r\non the alighting board the size of the entrance may be varied, and the\r\nbees always directed to it by the shape of the block, without any loss\r\nof time in searching for it--in case of robbing the hive, the hive can\r\nbe entirely closed with them. A board was formerly used to cover the\r\nframes, but is now generally abandoned, apiarists preferring duck,\r\nenameled cloth, or heavy muslin.\r\n\r\n    MRS. L.

This is much the\r\nBEST and CHEAPEST way to get out your firewood, because the 20-inch\r\nblocks are VERY EASILY split up, a good deal easier and quicker than the\r\nold-fashioned way of cutting the logs into 4-feet lengths, splitting it\r\ninto cordwood, and from that sawing it up with a buck saw into\r\nstovewood. We sell a large number of machines to farmers and others for\r\njust this purpose. A great many persons who had formerly burned coal\r\nhave stopped that useless expense since getting our Machine. Most\r\nfamilies have one or two boys, 16 years of age and up, who can employ\r\ntheir spare time in sawing up wood just as well as not. The\r\n\r\nMONARCH LIGHTNING SAWING MACHINE\r\n\r\nwill save your paying money and board to ONE hired man and perhaps TWO\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nThe boy at the right in the picture is sawing up cordwood in a buck\r\nframe. You can very easily use our machine in this way if you have\r\ncordwood on hand that you wish to saw up into suitable lengths for\r\nfirewood.\r\n\r\nA boy sixteen years old can work the machine all day and not get any\r\nmore tired than he would raking hay. The machine runs VERY EASILY, so\r\neasily, in fact, that after giving the crank half a dozen turns, the\r\noperator may let go and the machine will run itself for THREE OR FOUR\r\nREVOLUTIONS. Farmers owning standing timber cannot fail to see the many\r\nadvantages of this great LABOR-SAVING AND MONEY-SAVING MACHINE. If you\r\nprefer, you can easily go directly into the woods and easily saw the\r\nlogs into 20-inch lengths for your family use, or you can saw them into\r\n4-foot lengths, to be split into cordwood, when it can be readily hauled\r\noff to the village market. Many farmers are making a good deal of money\r\nwith this Machine in employing the dull months of the year in selling\r\ncordwood.\r\n\r\nIt makes a great difference in LABOR AND MONEY both in using our\r\nmachine, because you get away with a second man. It takes two men to run\r\nthe old-fashioned cross-cut saw, and it makes two backs ache every day\r\nthey use it. Not so with our saw.\r\n\r\nWe offer $1,000 for a sawing machine that is EASIER OPERATED and FASTER\r\nRUNNING than ours. Every farmer should own our machine. It will pay for\r\nitself in one season. Easily operated by a sixteen-year-old boy.\r\n\r\nLumbermen and farmers should GET THE BEST--GET THE CHEAPEST--GET THE\r\nMONARCH LIGHTNING SAWING MACHINE.\r\n\r\nE.

Jorden, of Bloomington, Indiana. It is one of those gossipy\r\nbits about the great scientist that every body enjoys reading.\r\n\r\nIn a recent visit to England, the writer strolled into the village of\r\nDown in Kent, and talked with some of the villagers in regard to Mr.\r\nDarwin, whose beautiful home is just outside the little town.\r\n\r\nSome of this talk, although in itself idle and valueless, may have an\r\ninterest to readers, as showing how a great man looks to his smaller\r\nneighbors.\r\n\r\nThe landlord of the \"George Inn\" said that \"all the people wished to\r\nhave Mr. Darwin buried in Down, but the government would not let them.\r\nIt would have helped the place so much. It would have brought hosts of\r\npeople down to see his grave. Especially it would have helped the hotel\r\nbusiness which is pretty dull in winter time.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Darwin was a very fine-looking man. He had a high forehead and wore\r\na long beard. Still, if you had met him on the street, perhaps, you\r\nwould not have taken much notice of him unless you knew that he was a\r\nclever man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir John Lubbock (Darwin's friend and near neighbor) is a very clever\r\nman, too, but not so clever nor so remarkable-looking as Mr. Darwin. He\r\nis very fond of hants (ants), and plants, and things.\"\r\n\r\nAt Keston, three miles from Down, the landlady of the Grayhound had\r\nnever heard of Mr. Darwin until after his death. There was then\r\nconsiderable talk about his being buried in Westminster, but nothing was\r\nsaid of him before.\r\n\r\nSeveral persons had considerable to say of Mr. Darwin's extensive and\r\njudicious charity to the poor. To Mr. Parslow, for many years his\r\npersonal servant, Mr. Darwin gave a life pension of £50, and the rent of\r\nthe handsome \"Home Cottage\" in Down. During the time of a water famine\r\nin that region, he used to ride about on horseback to see who needed\r\nwater, and had it brought to them at his own expense from the stream at\r\nSt. Mary's Cray.\r\n\r\n\"He was,\" said Mr. Parslow, \"a very social, nice sort of a gentleman,\r\nvery joking and jolly indeed; a good husband and a good father and a\r\nmost excellent master. Even his footmen used to stay with him as long as\r\nfive years. They would rather stay with him than take a higher salary\r\nsomewhere else. The cook came there while young and stayed there till\r\nhis death, nearly thirty years later.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs Darwin is a pleasant lady, a year older than her husband. Their\r\nboys are all jolly, nice young fellows. All have turned out so well, not\r\none of them rackety, you know. Seven children out of the ten are now\r\nliving.\r\n\r\n\"George Darwin is now a professor in Oxford. He was a barrister at\r\nfirst; had his wig and gown and all, but had to give it up on account of\r\nbad health. He would have made a hornament to the profession.\r\n\r\n\"Francis Darwin is a doctor, and used to work with his father in the\r\ngreenhouse. He is soon to marry a lady who lectures on Botany in Oxford.\r\n\r\n\"For the first twenty years after Mr. Darwin's return from South\r\nAmerica, his health was very bad--much more than later. He had a stomach\r\ndisease which resulted from sea-sickness while on the voyage around the\r\nworld. Mr. Parslow learned the watercure treatment and treated Mr.\r\nDarwin in that system, for a long time, giving much relief.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Darwin used to do his own writing but had copyists to get his work\r\nready for the printer. He was always an early man. He used to get up at\r\nhalf past six. He used to bathe and then go out for a walk all around\r\nthe place. Then Parslow used to get breakfast for him before the rest of\r\nthe family came down. He used to eat rapidly, then went to his study and\r\nwrote till after the rest had breakfast. Then Mrs. Darwin came in and he\r\nused to lie half an hour on the sofa, while she or someone else read to\r\nhim. Then he wrote till noon, then went out for an hour to walk. He used\r\nto walk all around the place. Later in life, he had a cab, and used to\r\nride on horseback. Then after lunch at one, he used to write awhile.\r\nAfterwards he and Mrs. Darwin used to go to the bedroom, where he lay\r\non a sofa and often smoked a cigarette while she read to him. After this\r\nhe used to walk till dinner-time at five. Before the family grew up,\r\nthey used to dine early, at half-past one, and had a meat-tea at\r\nhalf-past six.\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes there were eighteen or twenty young Darwins of different\r\nfamilies in the house. Four-in-hand coaches of young Darwins used\r\nsometimes to come down from London. Mr. Darwin liked children. They\r\ndidn't disturb him in the least. There were sometimes twenty or thirty\r\npairs of little shoes to be cleaned of a morning, but there were always\r\nplenty of servants to do this.\r\n\r\n\"The gardener used to bring plants into his room often of a morning, and\r\nhe used to tie bits of cotton on them, and try to make them do things.\r\nHe used to try all sorts of seeds. He would sow them in pots in his\r\nstudy.\r\n\r\n\"There were a quantity of people in Westminster Abbey when he was\r\nburied. Mr. Parslow and the cook were among the chief mourners and sat\r\nin the Jerusalem chamber. The whole church was as full of people as they\r\ncould stand. There was great disappointment in Down that he was not\r\nburied there. He loved the place, and we think that he would rather have\r\nrested there had he been consulted.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS.\r\n\r\nTo Our Readers.\r\n\r\nTHE PRAIRIE FARMER is the OLDEST, MOST RELIABLE, and the LEADING\r\nAGRICULTURAL JOURNAL OF THE GREAT NORTHWEST, devoted exclusively to the\r\ninterests of the Farmer, Gardener, Florist, Stock Breeder, Dairyman,\r\nEtc., and every species of industry connected with that great portion of\r\nthe People of the World, the PRODUCERS.

I have\r\npassed through one of the most wonderful ordeals that perhaps ever\r\noccurred to any man. The first intimation I had of it was several years\r\nago, when I began to feel chilly at night and restless after retiring.\r\nOccasionally this would be varied by a soreness of the muscles and\r\ncramps in my arms and legs. I thought, as most people would think, that\r\nit was only a cold and so paid as little attention to it as possible.\r\nShortly after this I noticed a peculiar catarrhal trouble and my throat\r\nalso became inflamed. As if this were not variety enough I felt sharp\r\npains in my chest, and a constant tendency to headache.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why didn't you take the matter in hand and check it right where it\r\nwas?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why doesn't everybody do so? Simply because they think it is only some\r\ntrifling and passing disorder. These troubles did not come all at once\r\nand I thought it unmanly to heed them. I have found, though, that every\r\nphysical neglect must be paid for and with large interest. Men can not\r\ndraw drafts on their constitution without honoring them sometime. These\r\nminor symptoms I have described, grew until they were giants of agony. I\r\nbecame more nervous; had a strange fluttering of the heart, an inability\r\nto draw a long breath and an occasional numbness that was terribly\r\nsuggestive of paralysis. How I could have been so blind as not to\r\nunderstand what this meant I can not imagine.\"\r\n\r\n\"And did you do nothing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I traveled. In the spring of 1879 I went to Kansas and Colorado,\r\nand while in Denver, I was attacked with a mysterious hemorrage of the\r\nurinary organs and lost twenty pounds of flesh in three weeks. One day\r\nafter my return I was taken with a terrible chill and at once advanced\r\nto a very severe attack of pneumonia. My left lung soon entirely filled\r\nwith water and my legs and body became twice their natural size. I was\r\nobliged to sit upright in bed for several weeks in the midst of the\r\nseverest agony, with my arms over my head, and constant fear of\r\nsuffocation.\"\r\n\r\n\"And did you still make no attempt to save yourself?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I made frantic efforts. I tried everything that seemed to offer\r\nthe least prospect of relief. I called a council of doctors and had them\r\nmake an exhaustive chemical and microscopical examination of my\r\ncondition. Five of the best physicians of Syracuse and several from\r\nanother city said I must die!\r\n\r\n\"It seemed as though their assertion was true for my feet became cold,\r\nmy mouth parched, my eyes wore a fixed glassy stare, my body was covered\r\nwith a cold, clammy death sweat, and I read my fate in the anxious\r\nexpressions of my family and friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the _finale_?\"\r\n\r\n\"Came at last. My wife, aroused to desperation, began to administer a\r\nremedy upon her own responsibility and while I grew better very slowly,\r\nI gained ground surely until, in brief, I have no trace of the terrible\r\nBright's disease from which I was dying, and am a perfectly well man.\r\nThis may sound like a romance, but it is true, and my life, health and\r\nwhat I am are due to Warner's Safe Cure, which I wish was known to and\r\nused by the thousands who I believe, are suffering this minute as I was\r\noriginally. Does not such an experience as this justify me in making a\r\npublic statement?\"\r\n\r\n\"It certainly does. But then Bright's disease is not a common complaint,\r\ndoctor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not common! On the contrary it is one of the most common. The trouble\r\nis, few people know they have it. It has so few marked symptoms until\r\nits final stages that a person may have it for years, each year getting\r\nmore and more in its power and not suspect it. It is quite natural I\r\nshould feel enthusiastic over this remedy while my wife is even more so\r\nthan I am. She knows of its being used with surprising results by many\r\nladies for their own peculiar ailments, over which it has singular\r\npower.\"\r\n\r\nThe statement drawn out by the above interview is amply confirmed by\r\nvery many of our most prominent citizens, among them being Judge Reigel,\r\nand Col. James S. Goodrich, of the Times, while Gen. Dwight H. Bruce and\r\nRev. Prof. W. P. Coddington, D. D., give the remedy their heartiest\r\nindorsement. In this age of wonders, surprising things are quite common,\r\nbut an experience so unusual as that of Dr. Martin's and occurring here\r\nin our midst, may well cause comment and teach a lesson. It shows the\r\nnecessity of guarding the slightest approach of physical disorder and by\r\nthe means which has been proven the most reliable and efficient. It\r\nshows the depth to which one can sink and yet be rescued and it proves\r\nthat few people need suffer if these truths are observed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO PRESERVE THE HEALTH\r\n\r\nUse the Magneton Appliance Co.'s\r\n\r\nMAGNETIC LUNG PROTECTOR!\r\n\r\nPRICE ONLY $5.\r\n\r\nThey are priceless to LADIES, GENTLEMEN, and CHILDREN with WEAK LUNGS;\r\nno case of PNEUMONIA OR CROUP is ever known where these garments are\r\nworn.

The pay is large in many instances, while\r\nthe service is continuous and honorable. Most of our railroad men began\r\nlife on the farm. Of this class is the author of the accompanying books\r\ndescriptive of railway operations, who has been connected continuously\r\nwith railroads as a subordinate and officer for 27 years. He was brought\r\nup on a farm, and began railroading as a lad at $7 per month. He has\r\nwritten a number of standard books on various topics connected with the\r\norganization, construction, management and policy of railroads. These\r\nbooks are of interest not only to railroad men but to the general reader\r\nas well. They are indispensable to the student. They present every phase\r\nof railroad life, and are written in an easy and simple style that both\r\ninterests and instructs. The books are as follows:\r\n\r\n\"RAILWAY EXPENDITURES--THEIR EXTENT,\r\nOBJECT AND ECONOMY.\"--A Practical\r\nTreatise on Construction and Operation.\r\nIn Two Volumes, 850 pages.                         $4.00\r\n\r\n\"HAND BOOK OF RAILWAY EXPENDITURES.\"--Practical\r\nDirections for Keeping\r\nthe Expenditure Accounts.                           2.00\r\n\r\n\"RAILWAY REVENUE AND ITS COLLECTION.\"--And\r\nExplaining the Organization of\r\nRailroads.                                          2.50\r\n\r\n\"THE BAGGAGE PARCEL AND MAIL TRAFFIC\r\nOF RAILROADS.\"--An interesting work\r\non this important service; 425 pages.               2.00\r\n\r\n\"TRAIN AND STATION SERVICE\"--Giving\r\nThe Principal Rules and Regulations governing\r\nTrains; 280 pages.                                  2.00\r\n\r\n\"THE TRACK ACCOUNTS OF RAILROADS.\"--And\r\nhow they should be kept.

God made him so stupid I doubt--\r\n      But I guess God who made us knows what He's about.\r\n\r\n    He'd a long way to walk. But he wouldn't once talk\r\n      Of that, nor the chores for his mother who lay\r\n      A shakin' at home. Still, day after day\r\n    He stood at the foot till the class 'gan to mock!\r\n      Then to master he plead, \"Oh I'd like to go head!\"\r\n      Now it wasn't so much, but the way it was said.\r\n\r\n    Then the war struck the land! Why the barefooted band\r\n      It just nailed up that door: and the very next day,\r\n      With master for Cap'en, went marchin' away;\r\n    And Bally the butt of the whole Wabash band.\r\n      But he bore with it all, yet once firmly said,\r\n      \"When I get back home, I'm agoin' up head!\"\r\n\r\n    Oh, that school-house that stood in the wild Wabash wood!\r\n      The rank weeds were growin' like ghosts through the floor.\r\n      The squirrels hulled nuts on the sill of the door.\r\n    And the gals stood in groups scrapin' lint where they stood.\r\n      And we boys! How we sighed; how we sickened and died\r\n      For the days that had been, for a place at their side.\r\n\r\n    Then one fever-crazed and his better sense dazed\r\n      And dulled with heart-sickness all duty forgot;\r\n      Deserted, was taken, condemned to be shot!\r\n    And Bally Dean guardin' his comrade half crazed,\r\n      Slow paced up and down while he slept where he lay\r\n      In the tent waitin' death at the first flush of day.\r\n\r\n    And Bally Dean thought of the boy to be shot,\r\n      Of the fair girl he loved in the woods far away;\r\n      Of the true love that grew like a red rose of May;\r\n    And he stopped where he stood, and he thought and he thought\r\n      Then a sudden star fell, shootin' on overhead.\r\n      And he knew that his mother beckon'd onto the dead.\r\n\r\n    And he said what have I? Though I live though I die.\r\n      Who shall care for me now? Then the dull, muffled drum\r\n      Struck his ear, and he knew that the master had come\r\n    With the squad. And he passed in the tent with a sigh,\r\n      And the doomed lad crept forth, and the drowsy squad led\r\n      With low trailin' guns to the march of the dead.\r\n\r\n    Then with face turned away tow'rd a dim streak of day,\r\n      And his voice full of tears the poor bowed master said,\r\n      As he fell on his knees and uncovered his head:\r\n    \"Come boys it is school time, let us all pray.\"\r\n      And we prayed. And the lad by the coffin alone\r\n      Was tearless, was silent, was still as a stone.\r\n\r\n    \"In line,\" master said, and he stood at the head;\r\n      But he couldn't speak now. So he drew out his sword\r\n      And dropped the point low for the last fatal word.\r\n    Then the rifles rang out, and a soldier fell dead!\r\n      The master sprang forward. \"Great Heaven,\" he said,\r\n      \"It is Bally, poor Bally, and he's gone up head!\"\r\n\r\n    --_Joaquin Miller._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOO FAT TO MARRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nA very fat young woman came to my office and asked to see me privately.\r\nWhen we were alone she said:\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure no one can overhear us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"You won't laugh at me, will you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Madam, I should be unworthy of your confidence if I could be guilty of\r\nsuch a rudeness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, sir; but no one ever called upon you on such a ridiculous\r\nerrand. You won't think me an idiot, will you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg of you to go on.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't care to know my name or residence?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not, if you care to conceal them.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have called to consult you about the strangest thing in the world. I\r\nwill tell you all. I am twenty-three years old. When I was nineteen I\r\nweighed 122 pounds; now I weigh 209; I am all filling up with fat. I can\r\nhardly breathe. The best young man that ever lived loves me, and has\r\nbeen on the point of asking me to marry him, but of course he sees I am\r\ngrowing worse all the time and he don't dare venture. I can't blame him.\r\nHe is the noblest man in the world, and could marry any one he chooses.\r\nI don't blame him for not wishing to unite himself to such a tub as I\r\nam. Why, Doctor, you don't know how fat I am. I am a sight to behold.\r\nAnd now I have come to see if any thing can be done. I know you have\r\nstudied up all sorts of curious subjects, and I thought you might be\r\nable to tell me how to get rid of this dreadful curse.\"\r\n\r\nShe had been talking faster and faster, and with more and more feeling\r\n(after the manner of fat women, who are always emotional), until she\r\nbroke down in hysterical sobs.\r\n\r\nI inquired about her habits--table and otherwise. She replied:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I starve myself; I don't eat enough to keep a canary bird alive,\r\nand yet I grow fatter and fatter all the time. I don't believe anything\r\ncan be done for me. We all have our afflictions, and I suppose we ought\r\nto bear them with fortitude. I wouldn't mind for myself, but it's just\r\nbreaking his heart; if it wasn't for him I could be reconciled.\"\r\n\r\nI then explained to her our nervous system, and the bearing certain\r\nconditions of one class of nerves has upon the deposition of adipose\r\ntissue. I soon saw she was not listening, but was mourning her sorrow.\r\nThen I asked her if she would be willing to follow a prescription I\r\nmight give her.\r\n\r\n\"Willing? willing?\" she cried. \"I would be willing to go through fire,\r\nor to have my flesh cut off with red-hot knives. There is nothing I\r\nwould not be willing to endure if I could only get rid of this horrible\r\ncondition.\"\r\n\r\nI prepared a prescription for her, and arranged that she should call\r\nupon me once a week, that I might supervise her progress and have\r\nfrequent opportunities to encourage her. The prescription which I read\r\nto her was this:\r\n\r\n1. For breakfast eat a piece of beef or mutton as large as your hand,\r\nwith a slice of white bread twice as large. For dinner the same amount\r\nof meat, or, if preferred, fish or poultry, with the same amount of\r\nfarinaceous or vegetable food in the form of bread or potato. For\r\nsupper, nothing.\r\n\r\n2. Drink only when greatly annoyed with thirst; then a mouthful of\r\nlemonade without sugar.\r\n\r\n3. Take three times a week some form of bath, in which there shall be\r\nimmense perspiration. The Turkish bath is best. You must work, either in\r\nwalking or some other way, several hours a day.\r\n\r\n\"But, doctor, I can't walk; my feet are sore.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought that might be the case, but if the soles of your shoes are\r\nfour inches broad, and are thick and strong, walking will not hurt your\r\nfeet. You must walk or work until you perspire freely, every day of the\r\nweek. Of course, you are in delicate health, with little endurance, but,\r\nas you have told me that you are willing to do anything, you are to work\r\nhard at something six or seven hours every day.\"\r\n\r\n4. You must rise early in the morning, and retire late at night. Much\r\nsleep fattens people.\r\n\r\n5. The terrible corset you have on, which compresses the center of the\r\nbody, making you look a great deal fatter than you really are, must be\r\ntaken off, and you must have a corset which any dress maker can fit to\r\nyou--a corset for the lower part of the abdomen, which will raise this\r\ngreat mass and support it.\r\n\r\n\"This is all the advice I have to give you at present. At first you will\r\nlose half a pound a day. In the first three months you will lose from\r\ntwenty to thirty pounds. In six months, forty pounds. You will\r\nconstantly improve in health, get over this excessive emotion, and be\r\nmuch stronger. Every one knows that a very fat horse weighing 1,200\r\npounds, can be quickly reduced to 1,000 pounds with great improvement to\r\nactivity and health. It is still easier with a human being. That you may\r\nknow exactly what is being done, I wish you to be weighed; write the\r\nfigures in your memorandum, and one week from now, when you come again,\r\nweigh yourself and tell me how much you have lost.\"\r\n\r\nI happened to be out of the city and did not see her until her second\r\nvisit, two weeks from our last meeting. It was plain when she entered\r\nthat already her system was being toned up, and when we were again in my\r\nprivate office, she said:\r\n\r\n\"I have lost six and a half pounds; not quite as much as you told me,\r\nbut I am delighted, though nearly starved. I have done exactly as you\r\nprescribed, and shall continue to if it kills me. You must be very\r\ncareful not to make any mistakes, for I shall do just as you say. At\r\nfirst the thirst was dreadful. I thought I could not bear it. But now I\r\nhave very little trouble with that.\"\r\n\r\nAbout four months after our first meeting this young woman brought a\r\nhandsome young man with her, and after a pleasant chat, she said to me:\r\n\r\n\"We are engaged; but I have told my friend that I shall not consent to\r\nbecome his wife until I have a decent shape. When I came to you I\r\nweighed 209 pounds; I now weigh 163 pounds. I am ten times as strong,\r\nactive, and healthy as I was then, and I have made up my mind, for my\r\nfriend has left it altogether to me, that when I have lost ten or\r\nfifteen pounds more, we shall send you the invitations.\"\r\n\r\nAs the wedding day approached she brought the figures 152 on a card, and\r\nexclaimed, with her blue eyes running over:\r\n\r\n\"I am the happiest girl in the world, and don't you think I have\r\nhonestly earned it? I think I am a great deal happier than I should have\r\nbeen had I not worked for it.\"\r\n\r\nThe papers said the bride was beautiful. I thought she was, and I\r\nsuppose no one but herself and husband felt as much interested in that\r\nbeauty as I did. I took a sort of scientific interest in it.\r\n\r\nWe made the usual call upon them during the first month, and when, two\r\nmonths after the wedding, they were spending the evening with us, I\r\nasked him if his wife had told him about my relations with her\r\navoirdupois? He laughed heartily, and replied:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, she has told me everything, I suppose: but wasn't it funny?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not very. I am sure you wouldn't have thought it funny if you could\r\nhave heard our first interview. It was just the reverse of funny; don't\r\nyou think so madam?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure it was the most anxious visit I ever paid any one. Doctor, my\r\ngood husband says he should have married me just the same, but I think\r\nhe would have been a goose if he had.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the husband, \"it was foreordained that we two should be\r\none.\"\r\n\r\n\"To be sure it was,\" replied the happy wife, \"because it was\r\nforeordained that I should get rid of those horrid fifty-seven pounds. I\r\nam going down till I reach one hundred and forty pounds, and there I\r\nwill stop, unless my husband says one hundred and thirty. I am willing\r\ndo anything to please him.\"--_Dio Lewis' Monthly._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORNAMENTS FOR HOMES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not the most expensively furnished houses that are the most\r\nhomelike, besides comparatively few persons have the means to gratify\r\ntheir love of pretty little ornaments with which to beautify their\r\nhomes. It is really painful to visit some houses; there naked walls and\r\ncheerless rooms meet you yet there are many such, and children in them\r\ntoo. How much might these homes be brightened by careful forethought in\r\nmaking some little ornaments that are really of no expense, save the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nComb cases, card receivers, letter holders, match safes, paper racks,\r\ncornucopias, and many other pretty and useful things can easily be made\r\nof nice clean paste board boxes (and the boxes are to be found in a\r\nvariety of colors). For any of these cut out the parts and nicely sew\r\nthem together, and the seams and raw edges can be covered with narrow\r\nstrips of bright hued paper or tape. Ornament them with transfer or\r\nscrap pictures.\r\n\r\nI have seen very pretty vases for holding dried flowers and grasses,\r\nmade of plain dark brown pasteboard, and the seams neatly covered with\r\nnarrow strips of paper. Pretty ottomans can be made by covering any\r\nsuitable sized box with a bit of carpeting, and stuffing the top with\r\nstraw or cotton. Or, if the carpeting is not convenient, piece a\r\ncovering of worsteds. A log cabin would be a pretty pattern.\r\n\r\nTo amuse the children during the long winter months, make a scrap-book\r\nof pictures. Collect all the old illustrated books, papers, and\r\nmagazines, and cut out the pictures and with mucilage nicely paste them\r\nin a book, first removing alternate leaves so it will not be too bulky.\r\nPerhaps this last remark is slightly wandering from my subject, but I\r\ncan't help it, I love the little folks and want them happy. Cares and\r\ntrouble will come to them soon enough. Autograph albums are quite the\r\nrage nowadays, and children get the idea and quite naturally think it\r\npretty nice, and want an album too. For them make a pretty album in the\r\nform of a boot. For the outside use plain red cardboard; for the inside\r\nleaves use unruled paper; fasten at the top with two tiny bows of narrow\r\nblue ribbon. A lady sent my little girl an autograph album after this\r\npattern for a birthday present and it is very neat indeed. Any of the\r\nlittle folks who want a pattern of it can have it and welcome by sending\r\nstamp to pay postage. For the wee little girl make a nice rag doll; it\r\nwill please her quite as well as a boughten one, and certainly last much\r\nlonger. I have a good pattern for a doll which you may also have if you\r\nwish it. A nice receptacle for pins, needles, thread, etc., can be made\r\nin form of an easy chair or sofa. Cut the part of pasteboard and cover\r\nthe seat, arms, and back with cloth, and stuff with cotton. Brackets\r\nmade of pasteboard will do service a long time.\r\n\r\n    MRS. F. A.

Do I hear some of THE PRAIRIE FARMER boys\r\nand girls exclaim, as a real grown-up lady did just before I left\r\nChicago: \"Halifax! why, yes, I have heard tell of the place, but did not\r\nthink that anybody ever really went there.\" People do go there, however,\r\nby the hundreds in the summer time, and a most delightful, hospitable,\r\ncharming class of inhabitants do they find the Blue Noses, as they are\r\ncalled--that is, when one goes to them very well introduced.\r\n\r\nBut we will have a little talk about Halifax and surroundings when you\r\nhave heard about the bear.\r\n\r\nWell, in the first place I did not, of course, see the bear in the city,\r\nbut in a place called Sackville--a section of country about five miles\r\nlong, and extending over hill and dale and valley; through woods and\r\nacross streams. My host owned a beautiful farm--picturesquely beautiful\r\nonly, not with a money-making beauty--situated upon the slope of a hill,\r\nwhere one could stand and look upon the most tender of melting sunsets,\r\naway off toward the broad old ocean.\r\n\r\nOne morning as we were all gathered upon the front stoop, grandpa,\r\nmamma, baby, kitten and all, we looked down the valley and saw coming up\r\nthe hill, led by two men, an immense yellow bear. One of the farm hands\r\nwas sent to call the men and the bear up to the house. The men, who were\r\nSwiss, were glad enough to come, as they were taking bruin through the\r\ncountry to show off his tricks and make thereby a little money.\r\n\r\nThe children were somewhat afraid at first, but soon felt quite safe\r\nwhen they saw he was firmly secured by a rope. Old bruin's keeper first\r\ngave him a drink of water, then poured a pailful over him, which he\r\nseemed to enjoy very much, as the day was a warm one. One of the men\r\nsaid something in Swiss, at which the bear gave a roar-like grunt and\r\ncommenced to dance. Around and around the great lumbering fellow went on\r\nhis two hind legs, holding his fore paws in the air. It was not what one\r\nwould call a very \"airy waltz,\" however. Again the keeper spoke, and\r\nimmediately bruin threw himself upon the ground and turned somersaults,\r\nmaking us all laugh heartily. He then told him to shake hands (but all\r\nin Swiss), and it was too funny to see the great awkward animal waddle\r\nup on his hind legs and extend first one paw and then the other. But\r\nwhat interested us all most, both big and little, was to hear the man\r\nsay, \"Kisse me,\" and then to watch the bear throw out his long tongue\r\nand lick his keeper's face.\r\n\r\nWe then gave the bear some milk to drink, when suddenly he gave a bound\r\nforward toward the baby. But he was securely tied, as we well knew. The\r\nmilk roused all the beast's savage instincts, one of the men said.\r\n\r\nBut what will interest you most of all will be the fact that on the farm\r\n(which consisted of five hundred acres, nearly all woodland) there were\r\nseen almost every morning the footprints of a real savage bear. The\r\nsheep were fast disappearing, and the farmers about were not a little\r\nworried. One day I went for a walk into these same woods, and such\r\nwoods! you Western boys and girls could not possibly imagine them--the\r\nold moss-covered logs, and immense trees cut down years ago and left to\r\nlie there until all overgrown with mosses and lichens. I never before\r\nexperienced such a feeling of solitude as in that walk of over a mile in\r\nlength through those deep dark woods, where sometimes we had literally\r\nto cut our way through with our little hatchets (we always carried them\r\nwith us when in the forest).\r\n\r\nAs I sauntered on, those lines of Longfellow's in Evangeline, came\r\nunconsciously to my mind, so exactly did they describe the place:\r\n\r\n    This is the forest primeval. The murmuring pines and the hemlocks,\r\n    Bearded with moss, and in garments green, indistinct in the twilight,\r\n    Stand like Druids of old, with voices sad and prophetic.\r\n    Stand like harpers hoar, with beards that rest on their bosoms.\r\n    Loud from its rocky caverns, the deep voiced neighboring ocean\r\n    Speaks, and in accents disconsolate answers the wail of the forest.\r\n\r\nNova Scotia is, as you all know the Acadian country of which our own\r\nfireside poet writes so beautifully. It was but a few miles from where I\r\nwas visiting that the scene of Evangeline, that exquisitely tender\r\nromance which so thrills the hearts of both old and young, was laid. As\r\nI drove through the country, coming ever and anon unexpectedly upon one\r\nof the many beautiful lakes from half a mile to two miles in length, in\r\nfancy I pictured the fair Evangeline and her guide, the good Father\r\nFelician, skirting these lakes in a light canoe as they traversed the\r\nwhole and through in the sad and fruitless search for the lost lover\r\nGabriel.\r\n\r\nNo wonder the soul of the poet was filled with such strange, mystic\r\nbeauty which thus found expression in rhythm and song, for Acadia has an\r\nenchantment all its own and can best be interpreted by the diviner\r\nthought of the poet.\r\n\r\nBut I am afraid, boys and girls, that I have chatted with you so long\r\nnow that there will be scarcely room this week to touch upon Halifax.\r\nBut, however, if you wish, I will try and talk to you about it next\r\nweek, and tell you of some of the winter sports the little Blue Noses\r\nindulge in in the winter time.\r\n\r\n    MARY HOWE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA FAIRY STORY BY LITTLE JOHNNY.\r\n\r\n\r\nMe an Billy we ben readn fairy tales, an I never see such woppers. I bet\r\nthe feller wich rote em will be burnt every tiny little bit up wen he\r\ndies, but Billy says they are all true but the facks. Uncle Ned sed cude\r\nI tell one, and I ast him wot about, and he sed: \"Wel Johnny, as you got\r\nto do the tellin I'le leav the choice of subjeck entirely to you; jest\r\ngiv us some thing about a little boy that went and sook his forten.\"\r\n\r\nSo I sed: \"One time there was a little boy went out for to seek his\r\nforten, and first thing he see was great big yello posy on a punkin\r\nvine.\"\r\n\r\nThen Uncle Ned he sed: \"Johnny, was that the punkin vine wich your bed\r\nonce had a bizness connection with?\" But I didn't anser, only went on\r\nwith the story.\r\n\r\n\"So the little boy he wocked into the posy, and crold down the vine on\r\nhis hands and kanees bout ten thousan hundred miles, till he come bime\r\nbi to a door, wich he opened an went in an found hisself in a grate big\r\nhouse, ofle nice like a kings pallows or a hotell. But the little boy\r\ndident find any body to home and went out a other door, where he see a\r\nocion with a bote, and he got in the bote.\"\r\n\r\nThen Uncle Ned he sed a uther time: \"Johnny, excuse the ignance of a man\r\nwich has been in Injy an evry were, but is it the regular thing for\r\npunkin vines to have sea side resorts in em?\"\r\n\r\nBut I only sed: \"Wen the little boy had saild out of site of land the\r\nbote it sunk, and he went down, down, down in the water, like he was\r\ntied around the neck of a mill stone, till he was swollowed by a wale,\r\ncos wales is the largest of created beings wich plows the deep, but\r\nlions is the king of beests, an the American eagle can lick ol other\r\nbirds, hooray! Wen the boy was a seekn his forten in the stummeck of the\r\nwales belly he cut to a fence, an wen he had got over the fence he found\r\nhisself in a rode runin thru a medder, and it was a ofle nice country\r\nfur as he cude see.\"\r\n\r\nUncle Ned sed: \"Did he put up at the same way side inn wich was\r\npatternized by Jonah wen he pennitrated to that part of the morl\r\nvinyerd?\"\r\n\r\nBut I said: \"Bimebi he seen a rope hangin down from the ski, and he\r\nbegin for to clime it up, a sayin, 'Snitchety, snatchety, up I go,' 'wot\r\ntime is it old witch?' 'niggers as good as a white man,' 'fee-faw-fum,'\r\n'Chinese mus go,' 'all men is equil fore de law,' 'blitherum, blatherum,\r\nboo,' and all the words of madgick wich he cude think of. After a wile\r\nit got reel dark, but he kep on a climeing, and pretty sune he see a\r\nround spot of dalite over his hed, and then he cum up out of a well in a\r\ngrate city.\"\r\n\r\nJest then my father he came in, and he said: \"Johnny, you get the bucket\r\nand go to the wel and fetch sum water for your mother to wash the\r\npotatoes.\"\r\n\r\nBut I said it was Billy's tern, and Billy he sed twasent no sech thing,\r\nand I said he lide, and he hit me on the snoot of my nose, and we fot a\r\nfite, but victery percht upon the banners of my father, cos he had a\r\nstick. Then wile me and Billy was crying Uncle Ned he spoke up and\r\nbegun: \"One time there was a grate North American fairy taler--\"\r\n\r\nBut I jest fetched Mose a kick, wich is the cat, and went out and pitcht\r\ninto Sammy Doppy, which licked me reel mean.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBREEDERS DIRECTORY.\r\n\r\nThe following list embraces the names of responsible and reliable\r\nBreeders in their line, and parties wishing to purchase or obtain\r\ninformation can feel assured that they will be honorably dealt with:\r\n\r\nCATTLE.\r\n\r\nJersey.\r\n\r\nMills, Charles F.....................Springfield, Illinois\r\n\r\nHORSES.\r\n\r\nClydesdales.\r\n\r\nMills, Charles F.....................Springfield, Illinois\r\n\r\nSWINE.\r\n\r\nBerkshire.\r\n\r\nMills, Charles F.....................Springfield, Illinois\r\n\r\nChester Whites.\r\n\r\nW.A.

To accomplish which we will give absolutely free a genuine\r\nFIRST WATER Diamond Ring, and the Home Companion for one year, for\r\nonly $2.00. Our reasons for making this unprecedented offer are as\r\nfollows;\r\n\r\nA newspaper with 200,000 subscribers can get 1c. per line per 1,000 of\r\ncirculation for its advertising space, or $5,000 per issue MORE than\r\nit costs to produce and mail the paper. With but 10,000 or 20,000\r\nsubscribers, its advertising revenues do not pay expenses. Only the\r\npapers with mammoth circulations make fortunes for their owners,\r\nDERIVED FROM ADVERTISING SPACE. For these and other reasons, we regard\r\n100,000 subscribers as being of more financial benefit to a paper than\r\nthe paper is to the subscribers. With 100,000 or 200,000 bona-fide\r\nsubscribers, we make $100,000 to $200,000 a year clear profit from\r\nadvertising, above cost of publishing. Without a large circulation, we\r\nwould lose money. Therefore, to secure a very large circulation, and\r\nthus receive high rates and large profits from advertising space, this\r\nONLY EQUITABLE plan of conducting business is adopted.\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST QUESTION TO BE ANSWERED IS,--is the diamond pure--a genuine\r\nstone?\r\n\r\nOUR ANSWER IS YES.\r\n\r\nThe stone is GUARANTEED to be no Alaska Diamond, Rhine Pebble, or other\r\nimitation, but a\r\n\r\nWARRANTED GENUINE AND PURE DIAMOND.\r\n\r\nIf it is not found so by the most careful and searching tests, we will\r\nrefund the money, enter the subscriber's name on our list, and have the\r\npaper mailed to him free during its existence. To the publisher of this\r\npaper has been sent a guarantee from the manufacturing Jeweler, from\r\nwhom we obtain these rings, that they are just as represented, so that\r\nreaders may rely upon the promises being fulfilled to the letter.\r\n\r\nThe second question is, IS THE PAPER A DESIRABLE FAMILY JOURNAL? YES.\r\nIt contains contributions from the first writers of the times: fiction,\r\nchoice facts, intellectual food of the most interesting, instructive and\r\nrefined character. It is one of the\r\n\r\nLEADING PAPERS OF THE PROGRESSIVE WEST.\r\n\r\nWe are determined to make it the most desirable and reliable paper in\r\nthe United States; will spare no effort or money to achieve that object.\r\nSample Copies sent free on application.

Henry Cavendish was born in England, Oct. 10, 1731, and died Feb.\r\n21, 1810. Cavendish was the son of Lord Charles Cavendish, a son of the\r\nDuke of Devonshire; and his mother was Lady Anne Grey, daughter of\r\nHenry, Duke of Kent. It is thus seen that the subject of this sketch\r\nbelonged to two of the two most aristocratic, noble families in England,\r\nhaving for grandfathers the Dukes of Kent and Devonshire. This man, who\r\nbecame one of the most distinguished chemists and physicists of the age,\r\nborn in high life, of exalted position and wealth, passed through the\r\nperiod of his boyhood and early manhood in utter obscurity, and a dense\r\ncloud rests upon his early life. Indeed, the place of his birth has been\r\nin dispute; some of his biographers asserting that he was born in\r\nEngland, others that he was born in France or Italy. It is now known\r\nthat he was born at Nice, whither his mother had gone for the sake of\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\nIt seems incredible that one highly distinguished, who lived and died so\r\nrecently, should have almost entirely escaped observation until he had\r\nreached middle life. From fragments of his early history which have been\r\ncollected, we learn that he was a peculiar boy,--shy, reticent, fond of\r\nsolitary walks, without playfellows, and utterly insensible to the\r\nattractions of home and social life. He was born with inflexible\r\nreserve; and the love of retirement so manifest in in later life\r\nmastered all his instincts even when a boy. If he had been of poor and\r\nobscure parentage, it would not seem so strange that one who for nearly\r\nfifty years was a Fellow of the Royal Society, and for a lengthened\r\nperiod a member of the Institute of France, and an object of European\r\ninterest to men of science, had no one to record the incidents of his\r\nearly life. But he lost his mother when almost an infant, and this sad\r\nevent probably influenced greatly his early career, and isolated him\r\nfrom the world in which he lived.\r\n\r\nWe find him at Dr. Newcome's school at Hackney in 1742, and from this\r\nschool he went directly to Cambridge, where he remained until 1753. He\r\ndid not graduate, true to his odd instincts, although he spent the full\r\nperiod for a degree at Cambridge. No records of his college life have\r\nbeen preserved, and, as he went to London, it is wonderful that the next\r\nten years of his life remain a blank. He joined the Royal Society in\r\n1760, but contributed nothing until 1766, when he published his first\r\npaper on \"Factitious Airs.\" Cavendish was a great mathematician,\r\nelectrician, astronomer, meteorologist, and as a chemist he was equally\r\nlearned and original. He lived at a time when science was to a large\r\nextent but blank empiricism; even the philosophy of combustion was based\r\non erroneous and absurd hypotheses, and the speculation of experimenters\r\nwere wild and fantastic. He was the first to submit these speculations\r\nto crucial tests, to careful and accurate experiment; and the results\r\nwhich were given to the world introduced a new era in scientific\r\nknowledge. We have so much to say regarding the man, that we can only\r\npresent a brief outline of his great discoveries. Alone, in a spacious\r\nhouse on Clapham Common, outside of London, did this singular man work\r\nthrough many long years, until he filled it with every possible device\r\ncapable of unfolding or illustrating principles in science.\r\n\r\nAt the time of a visit to London in 1856 this famous house was standing,\r\nand remained as it was when the owner left it, about a half century\r\nbefore. The exterior of the house would not attract special attention;\r\nbut within, the whole world could not, perhaps, furnish a parallel.\r\nAnvils and forges, files and hammers, grindstones and tempering-troughs,\r\nfurnaces and huge bellows, had converted the panelled and wall-frescoed\r\ndrawing-room into the shop of a blacksmith. In the spacious dining-room\r\nchemical apparatus occupied the place of furniture. Electrical machines,\r\nLeyden-jars, eudiometers, thermometric scales, philosophical\r\ninstruments, were distributed through the chambers. The third story,\r\nsave two bed-chambers,--one for the housekeeper, the other for the\r\nfootman,--had been fitted up for an observatory. The lenses and\r\nachromatic glasses, tubes and specula, concave mirrors, and\r\nobject-prisms, and the huge, rough old telescope, peering through the\r\nroof, were still there as their owner had left them. All appliances of\r\nhousekeeping were absent, and Cavendish House was destitute of all\r\ncomforts, for which the owner had no taste.\r\n\r\nIn this house Cavendish lived for nearly half a century, totally\r\nisolated from the world and all human sympathies. He seldom or never\r\nvisited relatives, and they were never guests at his house. He had\r\nseveral servants, all of whom were males, with one exception. He was shy\r\nof women, and did not like to have them come in his way. If he saw his\r\nfemale servant in any of the rooms, he would order her away instantly,\r\nor fly himself to other quarters. Rarely, during all the years of his\r\nsolitary life, did a woman cross his threshold; and, when one did, he\r\nwould run from her as if she brought the plague. His servants were all\r\ntrained to silence, and in giving his orders the fewest words possible\r\nwere used. His meals were served irregularly, whenever in the intervals\r\nof absorbing labors, he could snatch a fragment of time. He uniformly\r\ndined upon one kind of meat,--a joint of mutton; and he seemed to have\r\nno knowledge that there were other kinds in the market.\r\n\r\nUpon one occasion he had invited a few scientific friends to dinner at\r\nCavendish House, and when his servant asked him what he should provide,\r\n\"A leg of mutton!\" said Cavendish. \"It will hardly be enough,\" said the\r\nservant. \"Well, then get two.\" \"Anything else, sir?\" \"Yes, get four legs\r\nof mutton.\"\r\n\r\nHis dress was peculiar,--a snuff-colored coat reaching to his knees, a\r\nlong vest of the same color, buff breeches, and a three-cornered hat.\r\nWith him the fashion never changed; he had but one suit; not an extra\r\ncoat, hat, or even two handkerchiefs. When his wardrobe gave out, and he\r\nwas forced to see his tailor, he became very nervous. He would walk the\r\nroom in agony, give orders to have the tailor sent for, and then\r\nimmediately countermand the same. His shoes for fifty years were of one\r\npattern; and when he took them off they were put in one place behind a\r\ndoor, and woe to the servant who accidentally displaced them. He hung\r\nhis old three-cornered hat on one peg at his house, and when he attended\r\nthe meetings of the Royal Society he had a peg in the hall known as\r\n\"Cavendish's peg.\" If, through accident, it was taken by some member\r\nbefore his arrival, he would stop, look at the occupied peg, and then\r\nturn on his heel, and go back to his house. When he went to the\r\nmeetings, he walked in the middle of the street, never on the sidewalk;\r\nand he invariably took the same route. Upon reaching the steps leading\r\nto the rooms, he would stop, hesitate, put his hand on the door-handle,\r\nand look about timidly, and sometimes return at a rapid pace.\r\n\r\nHis cane, which he carried for fifty years, he placed upright in his\r\nleft boot, which he took off at the door, covering his foot with a\r\nslipper. Once inside the rooms of the Royal Society, and surrounded by\r\nthe most distinguished men of England and the world, he became\r\nexcessively shy, and read his wonderful papers in an awkward manner.\r\nApplause of any kind he could not bear; and if in conversation any one\r\npraised his researches or papers, he would turn away abruptly, as if\r\nhighly indignant. If he was appealed to as authority upon any point, he\r\nwould dart away, and perhaps quit the hall for the evening. This man of\r\ngreat genius and vast acquirements was incapable of understanding or\r\nenduring praise or flattery. He sought in every possible way to escape\r\nrecognition or notice, listened attentively to conversation, but seldom\r\nasked questions; never spoke of himself, or of what he had accomplished\r\nin the world of science.\r\n\r\nCavendish was a man possessed of vast wealth, and, when he died, he was\r\nthe richest bank-owner in all England.\r\n\r\n\"At the age of forty, a large accession came to his fortune. His income\r\nalready exceeded his expenditure. Pecuniary transactions were his\r\naversion. Other matters occupied his attention. The legacy was therefore\r\npaid in to his bankers. It was safe there, and he gave it no more heed.\r\nOne of the firm sought to see him at Clapham. In answer to the\r\ninquiries of the footman as to his Business, the banker replied to see\r\nMr. Cavendish personally. 'You must wait, then,' responded the servant,\r\n'till he rings his bell.' The banker tarried for hours, when the\r\nlong-expected bell rang. His name was announced. 'What does he want?'\r\nthe master was heard to ask. 'A personal interview.' 'Send him up.' The\r\nbanker appeared.\r\n\r\n\"'I am come, sir, to ascertain your views concerning a sum of two\r\nhundred thousand pounds placed to your account.'\r\n\r\n\"'Does it inconvenience you?' asked the philosopher. 'If so, transfer it\r\nelsewhere.'\r\n\r\n\"'Inconvenience, sir? By no means,' replied the banker. 'But pardon me\r\nfor suggesting that it is too large a sum to remain unproductive. Would\r\nyou not like to invest it?'\r\n\r\n\"'Invest it? Eh? Yes, if you will. Do as you like, but don't interrupt\r\nme about such things again. I have other matters to think about.'\"\r\n\r\nWith all his wealth it never occurred to him that others were in need,\r\nand that he might do good by benefactions. Solicited on one occasion to\r\ncontribute to a charitable object, he exclaimed, \"Give, eh! What do you\r\nwant? How much?\" \"Give whatever you please, sir,\" said the solicitor.\r\n\"Well, then, will ten thousand pounds do?\"\r\n\r\nOn another occasion he was forced, from circumstances, to attend a\r\nchristening in a church; and, when it was intimated to him that it was\r\ncustomary to bestow some little present upon the attending nurse, he ran\r\nup to her, and poured into her lap a double handful of gold coins, and\r\nhastily departed. This was the only occasion on which he was known to\r\ncross the threshold of a church. Cavendish died possessed of five\r\nmillion dollars of property, and yet at no time had he the slightest\r\nknowledge of how much he had, and how it was invested. He despised\r\nmoney, and made as little use of it as possible.\r\n\r\nAs regards matters of religion, he never troubled himself about them. He\r\nwould never talk upon the subject, and probably never gave it a thought.\r\nAll days of the week were alike to him: he was as busy on Sunday as on\r\nany other day. When asked by a friend what his views were of God, he\r\nreplied, \"Don't ask me such questions: I never think of them.\"\r\n\r\nThe circumstances of Cavendish's death are as remarkable as his career\r\nin life.\r\n\r\n\"Without premitory disease or sickness, or withdrawal from daily duties,\r\nor decadence of mental powers, or physical disability, he made up his\r\nmind that he was about to die. Closing his telescopes, putting his\r\nachromatic glasses in their several grooves, locking the doors of his\r\nlaboratories, destroying the papers he deemed useless, and arranging\r\nthose corrected for publication, he ascended to his sleeping-apartment\r\nand rang his bell. A servant appeared.\r\n\r\n\"'Edgar,' said Cavendish, addressing him by name, 'listen! Have I ever\r\ncommanded you to do an unreasonable thing?'\r\n\r\n\"The man heard the question without astonishment, for he knew his\r\nmaster's eccentricities, and replied in the negative.\r\n\r\n\"'And that being the case,' continued the old man, 'I believe I have a\r\nright to be obeyed.'\r\n\r\n\"The domestic bowed his assent.\r\n\r\n\"'I shall now give you my last command,' Cavendish went on to say, 'I am\r\ngoing to die. I shall, upon your departure, lock my room. Here let me be\r\nalone for eight hours. Tell no one. Let no person come near. When the\r\ntime has passed, come and see if I am dead. If so, let Lord George\r\nCavendish know. This is my last command. Now, go.'\r\n\r\n\"The servant knew from long experience that to dispute his master's will\r\nwould be useless. He bowed, therefore, and turned to go away.\r\n\r\n\"'Stay--one word!' added Cavendish. 'Repeat exactly the order I have\r\ngiven.'\r\n\r\n\"Edgar repeated the order, promised obedience once more, and retired\r\nfrom the chamber.\"\r\n\r\nThe servant did not keep his promise, but called to his master's bedside\r\nSir Everard Home, a distinguished physician.\r\n\r\n\"Sir Everard inquired if he felt ill.\r\n\r\n\"'I am not ill,' replied Cavendish; 'but I am about to die. Don't you\r\nthink a man of eighty has lived long enough? Why am I disturbed? I had\r\nmatters to arrange. Give me a glass of water.'\r\n\r\n\"The glass of water was handed to him; he drank it, turned on his back,\r\nclosed his eyes, and died.\r\n\r\n\"This end of a great man, improbable as are some of the incidents\r\nnarrated, is no fiction of imagination. Sir Everard Home's statement,\r\nread before the Royal Institution, corroborates every particular. The\r\nmental constitution of the philosopher, puzzling enough during his\r\nlife, was shrouded certainly in even greater mystery in his death.\"\r\n\r\nIt is as a chemist that Cavendish stands preeminent. Without\r\ninstructors, without companionship, in the solitary rooms of his\r\ndwelling, he meditated and experimented. The result of his researches he\r\ncommunicated in papers read to the Royal Society, and these are quite\r\nnumerous. He was the first to demonstrate the nature of atmospheric air\r\nand also of water. He was the discoverer of nitrogen and several gaseous\r\nbodies. He did much to overthrow the phlogiston theory, which was\r\nuniversally accepted in his time; and his researches upon arsenic were\r\nof the highest importance. There is scarcely any department of chemistry\r\nwhich he did not enrich by his discoveries. He was a close student of\r\nelectrical phenomena, and made many discoveries in this department of\r\nresearch. He was also an astronomer and observed the heavens with his\r\ntelescopes with the deepest interest. Some of his most important\r\ndiscoveries were unknown until after his death, as they were hidden in\r\npapers, which, for some reason, he would not publish.\r\n\r\nThe life of this singular man was morally a blank, and can only be\r\ndescribed by negations. He did not love; he did not hate; he did not\r\nhope; he did not worship. He separated himself from his fellow-men and\r\nfrom his God. There was nothing earnest, enthusiastic, heroic, in his\r\nnature, and as little that was mean, groveling, or ignoble. He was\r\npassionless, wholly destitute of emotion. Everything that required the\r\nexercise of fancy, imagination, faith, or affection, was distasteful to\r\nCavendish. He had a clear head for thinking, a pair of eyes for\r\nobserving, hands for experimenting and recording, and these were all.\r\nHis brain was a calculating engine; his eyes, inlets of vision, not\r\nfountains of tears; his heart, an anatomical organ necessary for the\r\ncirculation of the blood. If such a man can not be loved, he can not be\r\nabhorred or despised. He was as the Almighty made him, and he served an\r\nimportant end in the world.\r\n\r\nSuch a man manifestly would never sit for his portrait. And he never\r\ndid. It was taken by Borrow the painter, unobserved by Cavendish, while\r\nat a dinner-party given for the express purpose of securing the\r\nlikeness. It is now in the British Museum. Cuts of this painting are\r\nrare.--_Popular Science News._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE PRAIRIE FARMER\r\n\r\nAND\r\n\r\nYOUTH'S COMPANION\r\n\r\nONE YEAR, $3 FOR THE TWO.\r\n\r\nIt is not required that both papers be sent to one address, nor to the\r\nsame post-office.\r\n\r\n  Address PRAIRIE FARMER PUB.

Shipped.\r\nCattle                               38,913   18,801\r\nCalves                                  216       37\r\nHogs                                169,076   42,205\r\nSheep                                24,595   14,225\r\n\r\nCATTLE.--Notwithstanding a reported advance in England, cattle did not\r\nimprove in prices over Saturday. Indeed, there was a decline of a few\r\ncents per hundred. The supplies were large and the quality inferior.\r\nIndeed few really fat cattle came in during the week. Eastern markets\r\nwere reported as over stocked. Shippers and dressed meat operators\r\nbought rather freely of common lots. We may quote as follows:\r\n\r\nFancy fat cattle                                  $7 00@ 7 25\r\nChoice to prime steers                             6 25@ 6 85\r\nFair to good shipping steers                       5 60@ 6 20\r\nCommon to medium steers                            4 65@ 5 55\r\nButcher's steers                                   4 50@ 5 00\r\nCows and bulls, common to good                     3 25@ 4 50\r\nInferior cows and bulls                            2 30@ 3 20\r\nStockers                                           3 50@ 4 50\r\nFeeders                                            4 25@ 4 75\r\nMilch cows, per head                              25 00@55 00\r\nVeal calves, per 100 lbs.                          4 00@ 7 25\r\n\r\nHOGS.-There were fair receipts on Saturday and Monday--an aggregate of\r\n21,000 head or some 7,000 more than for the same days last week. As city\r\npackers are at work again, the market was quite active. They bought\r\nabout 15,000 head, and shippers took nearly all that were left. Prices\r\nadvanced from 5 to 10 cents. It may be said in general that the quality\r\nof the hogs now coming in is poor. Heavy lots were sold at $5 15@6 25;\r\nlight hogs brought $5@5 60. Skips and culls $3 25@5.\r\n\r\nNote.--All sales of hogs are made subject to a shrinkage of 40 lbs for\r\npiggy sows and 80 lbs for stags. Dead hogs sell for 1-1/2c per lb for\r\nweights of 200 and over and [Transcriber's Note: blank in original] for\r\nweights of less than 100 lbs.\r\n\r\nSHEEP.--The supply was sufficient to meet the demand, though\r\nconsiderably less than on Monday of last week. Really choice animals\r\nwere scarce. Shippers and butchers bought freely. Common lots were dull,\r\nbringing $5 25@5 50, while fancy lots sold at $5.75@6. Very inferior\r\nsheep sold at $2 50.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMISSION MERCHANTS.\r\n\r\nJ.H.
