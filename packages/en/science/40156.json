[Greek: ichthys], fish, and [Greek: logos],\r\ndoctrine or treatise), the branch of zoology which treats of the\r\ninternal and external structure of fishes, their mode of life, and their\r\ndistribution in space and time. According to the views now generally\r\nadopted, all those vertebrate animals are referred to the class of\r\nfishes which combine the following characteristics: they live in water,\r\nand by means of gills or branchiae breathe air dissolved in water; the\r\nheart consists of a single ventricle and single atrium; the limbs, if\r\npresent, are modified into fins, supplemented by unpaired median fins;\r\nand the skin is either naked or covered with scales or with osseous\r\nplates or bucklers. With few exceptions fishes are oviparous. There are,\r\nhowever, not a few members of this class which show a modification of\r\none or more of these characteristics, and which, nevertheless, cannot be\r\nseparated from it.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. HISTORY AND LITERATURE DOWN TO 1880\r\n\r\nThe commencement of the history of ichthyology coincides with that of\r\nzoology generally. Aristotle (384-322 B.C.) had a perfect knowledge of\r\nthe general structure of fishes, which he clearly discriminates both\r\nfrom the aquatic animals with lungs and mammae, i.e. Cetaceans, and from\r\nthe various groups of aquatic invertebrates. According to him: \"the\r\nspecial characteristics of the true fishes consist in the branchiae and\r\nfins, the majority having four fins, but those of an elongate form, as\r\nthe eels, having two only. Some, as the _Muraena_, lack the fins\r\naltogether. The rays swim with their whole body, which is spread out.\r\nThe branchiae are sometimes furnished with an operculum, sometimes they\r\nare without one, as in the cartilaginous fishes.... No fish has hairs or\r\nfeathers; most are covered with scales, but some have only a rough or a\r\nsmooth skin. The tongue is hard, often toothed, and sometimes so much\r\nadherent that it seems to be wanting. The eyes have no lids, nor are any\r\nears or nostrils visible, for what takes the place of nostrils is a\r\nblind cavity; nevertheless they have the senses of tasting, smelling and\r\nhearing. All have blood. All scaly fishes are oviparous, but the\r\ncartilaginous fishes (with the exception of the sea-devil, which\r\nAristotle places along with them) are viviparous. All have a heart,\r\nliver and gall-bladder; but kidneys and urinary bladder are absent. They\r\nvary much in the structure of their intestines: for, whilst the mullet\r\nhas a fleshy stomach like a bird, others have no stomachic dilatation.\r\nPyloric caeca are close to the stomach, and vary in number; there are\r\neven some, like the majority of the cartilaginous fishes, which have\r\nnone whatever. Two bodies are situated along the spine, which have the\r\nfunction of testicles; they open towards the vent, and are much enlarged\r\nin the spawning season. The scales become harder with age. Not being\r\nprovided with lungs, fishes have no voice, but several can emit grunting\r\nsounds. They sleep like other animals. In most cases the females exceed\r\nthe males in size; and in the rays and sharks the male is distinguished\r\nby an appendage on each side of the vent.\"\r\n\r\nAristotle's information on the habits of fishes, their migrations, mode\r\nand time of propagation, and economic uses is, so far as it has been\r\ntested, surprisingly correct. Unfortunately, we too often lack the means\r\nof recognizing the species of which he gives a description. His ideas of\r\nspecific distinction were as vague as those of the fishermen whose\r\nnomenclature he adopted; it never occurred to him that vernacular names\r\nare subject to change, or may be entirely lost in course of time, and\r\nthe difficulty of identifying his species is further increased by the\r\ncircumstance that sometimes several popular names are applied by him to\r\nthe same fish, or different stages of growth are designated by distinct\r\nnames. The number of fishes known to Aristotle seems to have been about\r\none hundred and fifteen, all of which are inhabitants of the Aegean Sea.\r\n\r\nThat one man should have laid so sure a basis for future progress in\r\nzoology is less surprising than that for about eighteen centuries a\r\nscience which seemed to offer particular attractions to men gifted with\r\npower of observation was no further advanced. Yet such is the case.\r\nAristotle's successors remained satisfied to be his copiers or\r\ncommentators, and to collect fabulous stories or vague notions. With few\r\nexceptions (such as Ausonius, who wrote a small poem, in which he\r\ndescribes from his own observations the fishes of the Moselle) authors\r\nabstained from original research; and it was not until about the middle\r\nof the 16th century that ichthyology made a new step in advance by the\r\nappearance of Belon, Rondelet and Salviani, who almost simultaneously\r\npublished their great works, by which the idea of species was\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Belon.\r\n\r\nP. Belon travelled in the countries bordering on the eastern part of the\r\nMediterranean in the years 1547-1550; he collected rich stores of\r\npositive knowledge, which he embodied in several works. The one most\r\nimportant for the progress of ichthyology is that entitled _De\r\naquatilibus libri duo_ (Paris, 1553). Belon knew about one hundred and\r\nten fishes, of which he gives rude but generally recognizable figures.\r\nAlthough Belon rarely gives definitions of the terms used by him, it is\r\nnot generally very difficult to ascertain the limits which he intended\r\nto assign to each division of aquatic animals. He very properly divides\r\nthem into such as are provided with blood and those without it--two\r\ndivisions corresponding in modern language to vertebrate and\r\ninvertebrate aquatic animals. The former are classified by him according\r\nto size, the further sub-divisions being based on the structure of the\r\nskeleton, mode of propagation, number of limbs, form of the body and\r\nphysical character of the habitat.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Salviani.\r\n\r\nThe work of the Roman ichthyologist H. Salviani (1514-1572), bears\r\nevidence of the high social position which the author held as physician\r\nto three popes. Its title is _Aquatilium animalium historia_ (Rome,\r\n1554-1557, fol.). It treats exclusively of the fishes of Italy.\r\nNinety-two species are figured on seventy-six plates, which, as regards\r\nartistic execution, are masterpieces of that period, although those\r\nspecific characteristics which nowadays constitute the value of a\r\nzoological drawing were overlooked by the author or artist. No attempt\r\nis made at a natural classification, but the allied forms are generally\r\nplaced in close proximity. The descriptions are equal to those given by\r\nBelon, entering much into the details of the economy and uses of the\r\nseveral species, and were evidently composed with the view of collecting\r\nin a readable form all that might prove of interest to the class of\r\nsociety in which the author moved. Salviani's work is of a high order.\r\nIt could not fail to render ichthyology popular in the country to the\r\nfauna of which it was devoted, but it was not fitted to advance\r\nichthyology as a science generally; in this respect Salviani is not to\r\nbe compared with Rondelet or Belon.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Rondelet.\r\n\r\nG. Rondelet (1507-1557) had the great advantage over Belon of having\r\nreceived a medical education at Paris, and especially of having gone\r\nthrough a complete course of instruction in anatomy as a pupil of\r\nGuentherus of Andernach. This is conspicuous throughout his\r\nworks--_Libri de piscibus marinis_ (Lyons, 1554); and _Universae\r\naquatilium historiae pars altera_ (Lyons, 1555). Nevertheless they\r\ncannot be regarded as more than considerably enlarged editions of\r\nBelon's work. For, although he worked independently of the latter, the\r\nsystem adopted by him is characterized by the same absence of the true\r\nprinciples of classification. His work is almost entirely limited to\r\nEuropean and chiefly to Mediterranean forms, and comprises no fewer than\r\none hundred and ninety-seven marine and forty-seven fresh-water fishes.\r\nHis descriptions are more complete and his figures much more accurate\r\nthan those of Belon; and the specific account is preceded by\r\nintroductory chapters, in which he treats in a general manner of the\r\ndistinctions, the external and internal parts, and the economy of\r\nfishes. Like Belon, he had no conception of the various categories of\r\nclassification--confounding throughout his work the terms \"genus\" and\r\n\"species,\" but he had an intuitive notion of what his successors called\r\na \"species,\" and his principal object was to give as much information as\r\npossible regarding such species.\r\n\r\nFor nearly a century the works of Belon and Rondelet continued to be the\r\nstandard works on ichthyology; but the science did not remain stationary\r\nduring that period. The attention of naturalists was now directed to the\r\nfauna of foreign countries, especially of the Spanish and Dutch\r\npossessions in the New World; and in Europe the establishment of\r\nanatomical schools and academies led to careful investigation of the\r\ninternal anatomy of the most remarkable European forms. Limited as these\r\nefforts were as to their scope, they were sufficiently numerous to\r\nenlarge the views of naturalists, and to destroy that fatal dependence\r\non preceding authorities which had kept in bonds even Rondelet and\r\nBelon. The most noteworthy of those engaged in these inquiries in\r\ntropical countries were W. Piso and G. Marcgrave, who accompanied as\r\nphysicians the Dutch governor, Count Maurice of Nassau, to Brazil\r\n(1630-1644).\r\n\r\nOf the men who left records of their anatomical researches, we may\r\nmention Borelli (1608-1679), who wrote a work _De motu animalium_ (Rome,\r\n1680, 4to), in which he explained the mechanism of swimming and the\r\nfunction of the air-bladder; M. Malpighi (1628-1694), who examined the\r\noptic nerve of the sword-fish; the celebrated J. Swammerdam (1637-1680),\r\nwho described the intestines of numerous fishes; and J. Duverney\r\n(1648-1730), who investigated in detail the organs of respiration.\r\n\r\nA new era in the history of ichthyology commences with Ray, Willughby\r\nand Artedi, who were the first to recognize the true principles by which\r\nthe natural affinities of animals should be determined. Their labours\r\nstand in so intimate a connexion with each other that they represent but\r\none great step in the progress of this science.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ray and Willughby.\r\n\r\nJ. Ray (1628-1705) was the friend and guide of F. Willughby (1635-1672).\r\nThey found that a thorough reform in the method of treating the\r\nvegetable and animal kingdoms had become necessary; that the only way of\r\nbringing order into the existing chaos was by arranging the various\r\nforms according to their structure. They therefore substituted facts for\r\nspeculation, and one of the first results of this change, perhaps the\r\nmost important, was that, having recognized \"species\" as such, they\r\ndefined the term and fixed it as the starting-point of all sound\r\nzoological knowledge.\r\n\r\nAlthough they had divided their work so that Ray attended to the plants\r\nprincipally, and Willughby to the animals, the _Historia piscium_ (Oxf.,\r\n1686), which bears Willughby's name on the title-page and was edited by\r\nRay, is their joint production. A great part of the observations\r\ncontained in it were collected during the journeys they made together in\r\nGreat Britain and in the various countries of Europe.\r\n\r\nBy the definition of fishes as animals with blood, breathing by gills,\r\nprovided with a single ventricle of the heart, and either covered with\r\nscales or naked, the Cetaceans are excluded. The fishes proper are\r\narranged primarily according to the cartilaginous or the osseous nature\r\nof the skeleton, and then subdivided according to the general form of\r\nthe body, the presence or the absence of ventral fins, the soft or the\r\nspinous structure of the dorsal rays, the number of dorsal fins, &c. No\r\nfewer than four hundred and twenty species are thus arranged and\r\ndescribed, of which about one hundred and eighty were known to the\r\nauthors from personal examination--a comparatively small proportion,\r\nbut descriptions and figures still formed in great measure the\r\nsubstitute for our modern collections and museums. With the increasing\r\naccumulation of forms, the want of a fixed nomenclature had become more\r\nand more felt.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Artedi.\r\n\r\nPeter Artedi (1705-1734) would have been a great ichthyologist if Ray or\r\nWillughby had not preceded him. But he was fully conscious of the fact\r\nthat both had prepared the way for him, and therefore he did not fail to\r\nreap every possible advantage from their labours. His work, edited by\r\nLinnaeus, is divided as follows:--\r\n\r\n  (1) In the _Bibliotheca ichthyologica_ Artedi gives a very complete\r\n  list of all preceding authors who had written on fishes, with a\r\n  critical analysis of their works. (2) The _Philosophia ichthyologica_\r\n  is devoted to a description of the external and internal parts of\r\n  fishes; Artedi fixes a precise terminology for all the various\r\n  modifications of the organs, distinguishing between those characters\r\n  which determine a genus and such as indicate a species or merely a\r\n  variety; in fact he establishes the method and principles which\r\n  subsequently have guided every systematic ichthyologist. (3) The\r\n  _Genera piscium_ contains well-defined diagnoses of forty-five genera,\r\n  for which he has fixed an unchangeable nomenclature. (4) In the\r\n  _Species piscium_ descriptions of seventy-two species, examined by\r\n  himself, are given--descriptions which even now are models of\r\n  exactitude and method. (5) Finally, in the _Synonymia piscium_\r\n  references to all previous authors are arranged for every species,\r\n  very much in the manner which is adopted in the systematic works of\r\n  the present day.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Linnaeus.\r\n\r\nArtedi has been justly called the father of ichthyology. So admirable\r\nwas his treatment of the subject, that even Linnaeus could only modify\r\nand add to it. Indeed, so far as ichthyology is concerned, Linnaeus has\r\nscarcely done anything beyond applying binominal terms to the species\r\nproperly described and classified by Artedi. His classification of the\r\ngenera appears in the 12th edition of the _Systema_ thus:--\r\n\r\n  A. _Amphibia nantia._--_Spiraculis compositis._--Petromyzon, Raía,\r\n  Squalus, Chimaera. _Spiraculis solitariis._--Lophius, Acipenser,\r\n  Cyclopterus, Balistes, Ostracion, Tetrodon, Diodon, Centriscus,\r\n  Syngnathus, Pegasus.\r\n\r\n  B. _Pisces apodes._--Muraena, Gymnotus, Trichiurus, Anarrhichas,\r\n  Ammodytes, Ophidium, Stromateus, Xiphias.\r\n\r\n  C. _Pisces jugulares._--Callionymus, Uranoscopus, Trachinus, Gadus,\r\n  Blennius.\r\n\r\n  D. _Pisces thoracici._--Cepola, Echeneis, Coryphaena, Gobius, Cottus,\r\n  Scorpaena, Zeus, Pleuronectes, Chaetodon, Sparus, Labrus, Sciaena,\r\n  Perca, Gasterosteus, Scomber, Mullus, Trigla.\r\n\r\n  E. _Pisces abdominales._--Cobitis, Amia, Silurus, Teuthis, Loricaria,\r\n  Salmo, Fistularia, Esox, Elops, Argentina, Atherina, Mugil, Mormyrus,\r\n  Exocoetus, Polynemus, Clupea, Cyprinus.\r\n\r\nTwo contemporaries of Linnaeus, L. T. Gronow and J. T. Klein, attempted\r\na systematic arrangement of fishes.\r\n\r\nThe works of Artedi and Linnaeus led to an activity of research,\r\nespecially in Scandinavia, Holland, Germany and England, such as has\r\nnever been equalled in the history of biological science. Whilst some of\r\nthe pupils and followers of Linnaeus devoted themselves to the\r\nexamination and study of the fauna of their native countries, others\r\nproceeded on voyages of discovery to foreign and distant lands. Of these\r\nlatter the following may be especially mentioned: O. Fabricius worked\r\nout the fauna of Greenland; Peter Kalm collected in North America, F.\r\nHasselquist in Egypt and Palestine, M. T. Brünnich in the Mediterranean,\r\nOsbeck in Java and China, K. P. Thunberg in Japan; Forskål examined and\r\ndescribed the fishes of the Red Sea; G. W. Steller, P. S. Pallas, S. G.\r\nGmelin, and A. J. Güldenstädt traversed nearly the whole of the Russian\r\nempire in Europe and Asia. Others attached themselves as naturalists to\r\ncelebrated navigators, such as the two Forsters (father and son) and\r\nSolander, who accompanied Cook; P. Commerson, who travelled with\r\nBougainville; and Pierre Sonnerat. Of those who studied the fishes of\r\ntheir native countries, the most celebrated were Pennant (Great\r\nBritain), O. F. Müller (Denmark), Duhamel du Monceau (France), C. von\r\nMeidinger (Austria), J. Cornide (Spain), and A. Parra (Cuba).\r\n\r\nThe mass of materials brought together was so great that, not long after\r\nthe death of Linnaeus, the necessity made itself felt for collecting\r\nthem in a compendious form. Several compilers undertook this task; they\r\nembodied the recent discoveries in new editions of the classical works\r\nof Artedi and Linnaeus, but, they only succeeded in burying those noble\r\nmonuments under a chaotic mass of rubbish. For ichthyology it was\r\nfortunate that two men at least, Bloch and Lacepède, made it a subject\r\nof prolonged original research.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Bloch.\r\n\r\nMark Eliezer Bloch (1723-1799), a physician of Berlin, had reached the\r\nage of fifty-six when he began to write on ichthyological subjects. His\r\nwork consists of two divisions:-- (1) _Öconomische Naturgeschichte der\r\nFische Deutschlands_ (Berl., 1782-1784); (2) _Naturgeschichte der\r\nausländischen Fische_ (Berl., 1785-1795). The first division, which is\r\ndevoted to a description of the fishes of Germany, is entirely original.\r\nHis descriptions as well as figures were made from nature, and are, with\r\nfew exceptions, still serviceable; indeed many continue to be the best\r\nexisting in literature. Bloch was less fortunate, and is much less\r\ntrustworthy, in his natural history of foreign fishes. For many of the\r\nspecies he had to trust to more or less incorrect drawings and\r\ndescriptions by travellers; frequently, also, he was deceived as to the\r\norigin of specimens which he purchased. Hence his accounts contain\r\nnumerous errors, which it would have been difficult to correct had not\r\nnearly the whole of the materials on which his work is based been\r\npreserved in the collections at Berlin.\r\n\r\nAfter the completion of his great work Bloch prepared a general system\r\nof fishes, in which he arranged not only those previously described, but\r\nalso those with which he had afterwards become acquainted. The work was\r\nably edited and published after Bloch's death by a philologist, J. G.\r\nSchneider, under the title _M. E. Blochii Systema ichthyologiae iconibus\r\ncx. illustratum_ (Berl., 1801). The number of species enumerated amounts\r\nto 1519. The system is based upon the number of the fins, the various\r\norders being termed _Hendecapterygii_, _Decapterygii_, &c. An artificial\r\nmethod like this led to the most unnatural combinations and\r\ndistinctions.\r\n\r\nBloch's _Naturgeschichte_ remained for many years the standard work. But\r\nas regards originality of thought Bloch was far surpassed by his\r\ncontemporary, B. G. E. de Lacepède, born at Agen, in France, in 1756,\r\nwho became professor at the museum of natural history in Paris, where he\r\ndied in 1825.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Lacepède.\r\n\r\nLacepède had to contend with great difficulties in the preparations of\r\nhis _Histoire des poissons_ (Paris, 1798-1803, 5 vols.), which was\r\nwritten during the most disturbed period of the French Revolution. A\r\ngreat part of it was composed whilst the author was separated from\r\ncollections and books, and had to rely on his notes and manuscripts\r\nonly. Even the works of Bloch and other contemporaneous authors remained\r\nunknown or inaccessible to him for a long time. His work, therefore,\r\nabounds in the kind of errors into which a compiler is liable to fall.\r\nThus the influence of Lacepède on the progress of ichthyology was vastly\r\nless than that of his fellow-labourer; and the labour laid on his\r\nsuccessors in correcting numerous errors probably outweighed the\r\nassistance which they derived from his work.\r\n\r\nThe work of the principal students of ichthyology in the period between\r\nRay and Lacepède was chiefly systematizing and describing; but the\r\ninternal organization of fishes also received attention from more than\r\none great anatomist. Albrecht von Haller, Peter Camper and John Hunter\r\nexamined the nervous system and the organs of sense; and Alexander\r\nMonro, _secundus_, published a classical work, _The Structure and\r\nPhysiology of Fishes Explained and Compared with those of Man and other\r\nAnimals_ (Edin., 1785). The electric organs of fishes (_Torpedo_ and\r\n_Gymnotus_) were examined by Réaumur, J. N. S. Allamand, E. Bancroft,\r\nJohn Walsh, and still more exactly by J. Hunter. The mystery of the\r\npropagation of the eel called forth a large number of essays, and even\r\nthe artificial propagation of _Salmonidae_ was known and practised by J.\r\nG. Gleditsch (1764).\r\n\r\nBloch and Lacepède's works were almost immediately succeeded by the\r\nlabours of Cuvier, but his early publications were tentative,\r\npreliminary and fragmentary, so that some little time elapsed before the\r\nspirit infused into ichthyology by this great anatomist could exercise\r\nits influence on all the workers in this field.\r\n\r\n  The _Descriptions and Figures of Two Hundred Fishes collected at\r\n  Vizagapatam on the Coast of Coromandel_ (Lond., 1803, 2 vols.) by\r\n  Patrick Russel, and _An Account of the Fishes found in the River\r\n  Ganges and its Branches_ (Edin., 1822, 2 vols.) by F. Hamilton\r\n  (formerly Buchanan), were works distinguished by greater accuracy of\r\n  the drawings (especially the latter) than was ever attained before. A\r\n  _Natural History of British Fishes_ was published by E. Donovan\r\n  (Lond., 1802-1808); and the Mediterranean fauna formed the study of\r\n  the lifetime of A. Risso, _Ichthyologie de Nice_ (Paris, 1810); and\r\n  _Histoire naturelle de l'Europe méridionale_ (Paris, 1827). A slight\r\n  beginning in the description of the fishes of the United States was\r\n  made by Samuel Latham Mitchell (1764-1831), who published, besides\r\n  various papers, a _Memoir on the Ichthyology of New York_, in 1815.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Cuvier.\r\n\r\n  Valenciennes.\r\n\r\nG. Cuvier (1769-1832) devoted himself to the study of fishes with\r\nparticular predilection. The investigation of their anatomy, and\r\nespecially their skeleton, was continued until he had succeeded in\r\ncompleting so perfect a framework of the system of the whole class that\r\nhis immediate successors required only to fill up those details for\r\nwhich their master had had no leisure. He ascertained the natural\r\naffinities of the infinite variety of forms, and accurately defined the\r\ndivisions, orders, families and genera of the class, as they appear in\r\nthe various editions of the _Règne Animal_. His industry equalled his\r\ngenius; he formed connections with almost every accessible part of the\r\nglobe; and for many years the museum of the Jardin des Plantes was the\r\ncentre where all ichthyological treasures were deposited. Thus Cuvier\r\nbrought together a collection which, as it contains all the materials on\r\nwhich his labours were based, must still be considered as the most\r\nimportant. Soon after the year 1820, Cuvier, assisted by one of his\r\npupils, A. Valenciennes, commenced his great work on fishes, _Historie\r\nnaturelle des Poissons_, of which the first volume appeared in 1828.\r\nAfter Cuvier's death in 1832 the work was left entirely in the hands of\r\nValenciennes, whose energy and interest gradually slackened, rising to\r\ntheir former pitch in some parts only, as, for instance, in the\r\ntreatise, on the herring. He left the work unfinished with the\r\ntwenty-second volume (1848), which treats of the Salmonoids. Yet,\r\nincomplete as it is, it is indispensable to the student.\r\n\r\nThe system finally adopted by Cuvier is the following:--\r\n\r\n    A. POISSONS OSSEUX.\r\n\r\n    I. A BRANCHIES EN PEIGNES OU EN LAMES.\r\n\r\n  1. _A Mâchoire Supérieure Libre._\r\n\r\n  a. Acanthoptérygiens.\r\n\r\n  Percoïdes.           Sparoïdes.        Branchies labyrinthiques.\r\n  Polynèmes.           Chétodonoïdes.    Lophioïdes.\r\n  Mulles.              Scombéroïdes.     Gobioïdes.\r\n  Joues cuirassées.    Muges.            Labroïdes.\r\n  Sciénoïdes.\r\n\r\n  b. Malacoptérygiens.\r\n\r\n  _Abdominaux._        _Subbrachiens._   _Apodes._\r\n     ---                   ---              ---\r\n  Cyprinoïdes.         Gadoïdes.         Murénoïdes.\r\n  Siluroïdes.          Pleuronectes.\r\n  Salmonoïdes.         Discoboles.\r\n  Clupéoïdes.\r\n  Lucioïdes.\r\n\r\n  2. _A Mâchoire Supérieure Fixée._\r\n\r\n  Selérodermes.        Gymnodontes.\r\n\r\n    II. A BRANCHIES EN FORME DE HOUPPES.\r\n\r\n  Lophobranches.\r\n\r\n    B. CARTILAGINEUX OU CHONDROPTÉRYGIENS.\r\n\r\n  Sturioniens.         Plagiostomes.     Cyclostomes.\r\n\r\nWe have only to compare this system with that of Linnaeus if we wish to\r\nmeasure the gigantic stride made by ichthyology during the intervening\r\nperiod of seventy years. The various characters employed for\r\nclassification have been examined throughout the whole class, and their\r\nrelative importance has been duly weighed and understood. The important\r\ncategory of \"family\" appears now in Cuvier's system fully established as\r\nintermediate between genus and order. Important changes in Cuvier's\r\nsystem have been made and proposed by his successors, but in the main it\r\nis still that of the present day.\r\n\r\nCuvier had extended his researches beyond the living forms, into the\r\nfield of palaeontology; he was the first to observe the close\r\nresemblance of the scales of the fossil _Palaeoniscus_ to those of the\r\nliving _Polypterus_ and _Lepidosteus_, the prolongation and identity of\r\nstructure of the upper caudal lobe in _Palaeoniscus_ and the sturgeons,\r\nthe presence of peculiar \"fulcra\" on the anterior margin of the dorsal\r\nfin in _Palaeoniscus_ and _Lepidosteus_, and inferred from these facts\r\nthat the fossil genus was allied either to the sturgeons or to\r\n_Lepidosteus_. But it did not occur to him that there was a close\r\nrelationship between those recent fishes. _Lepidosteus_ and, with it,\r\nthe fossil genus remained in his system a member of the order of\r\n_Malacopterygii abdominales_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Agassiz.\r\n\r\nIt was left to L. Agassiz (1807-1873) to point out the importance of the\r\nstructure of the scales as a characteristic, and to open a path towards\r\nthe knowledge of a whole new subclass of fishes, the _Ganoidei_.\r\nImpressed with the fact that the peculiar scales of _Polypterus_ and\r\n_Lepidosteus_ are common to all fossil osseous fishes down to the Chalk,\r\nhe takes the structure of the scales generally as the base for an\r\nichthyological system, and distinguishes four orders:--\r\n\r\n  1. _Placoids._--Without scales proper, but with scales of enamel,\r\n  sometimes large, sometimes small, and reduced to mere points (Rays,\r\n  Sharks and Cyclostomi, with the fossil Hybodontes). 2.\r\n  _Ganoids._--With angular bony scales, covered with a thick stratum of\r\n  enamel: to this order belong the fossil Lepidoides, Sauroides,\r\n  Pycnodontes and Coelacanthi; the recent Polypterus, Lepidosteus,\r\n  Sclerodermi, Gymnodontes, Lophobranches and Siluroides; also the\r\n  Sturgeons. 3. _Ctenoids._--With rough scales, which have their free\r\n  margins denticulated: Chaetodontidae, Pleuronectidae, Percidae,\r\n  Polyacanthi, Sciaenidae, Sparidae, Scorpaenidae, Aulostomi. 4.\r\n  _Cycloids._--With smooth scales, the hind margin of which lacks\r\n  denticulation: Labridae, Mugilidae, Scombridae, Gadoidei, Gobiidae,\r\n  Muraenidae, Lucioidei, Salmonidae, Clupeidae, Cyprinidae.\r\n\r\nIf Agassiz had had an opportunity of acquiring a more extensive and\r\nintimate knowledge of existing fishes before his energies were absorbed\r\nin the study of fossil remains, he would doubtless have recognized the\r\nartificial character of his classification. The distinctions between\r\ncycloid and ctenoid scales, between placoid and ganoid fishes, are\r\nvague, and can hardly be maintained. So far as the living and\r\npost-Cretacean forms are concerned, he abandoned the vantage-ground\r\ngained by Cuvier; and therefore his system could never supersede that of\r\nhis predecessor, and finally shared the fate of every classification\r\nbased on the modifications of one organ only. But Agassiz opened an\r\nimmense new field of research by his study of the infinite variety of\r\nfossil forms. In his principal work, _Recherches sur les poissons\r\nfossiles_, Neuchâtel, 1833-1843, 4to, atlas in fol., he placed them\r\nbefore the world arranged in a methodical manner, with excellent\r\ndescriptions and illustrations. His power of discernment and penetration\r\nin determining even the most fragmentary remains is astonishing; and, if\r\nhis order of Ganoids is an assemblage of forms very different from what\r\nis now understood by that term, he was the first who recognized that\r\nsuch an order of fishes exists.\r\n\r\nThe discoverer of the _Ganoidei_ was succeeded by their explorer\r\nJohannes Müller (1801-1858). In his classical memoir _Über den Bau und\r\ndie Grenzen der Ganoiden_ (Berl., 1846) he showed that the Ganoids\r\ndiffer from all the other osseous fishes, and agree with the\r\nPlagiostomes, in the structure of the heart. By this primary character,\r\nall heterogeneous elements, as Siluroids, _Osteoglossidae_, &c., were\r\neliminated from the order as understood by Agassiz. On the other hand,\r\nhe did not recognize the affinity of _Lepidosiren_ to the Ganoids, but\r\nestablished for it a distinct subclass, _Dipnoi_, which he placed at the\r\nopposite end of the system. By his researches into the anatomy of the\r\nlampreys and _Amphioxus_, their typical distinctness from other\r\ncartilaginous fishes was proved; they became the types of two other\r\nsubclasses, _Cyclostomi_ and _Leptocardii_.\r\n\r\nMüller proposed several other modifications of the Cuvierian system;\r\nand, although all cannot be maintained as the most natural arrangements,\r\nyet his researches have given us a much more complete knowledge of the\r\norganization of the Teleostean fishes, and later inquiries have shown\r\nthat, on the whole, the combinations proposed by him require only some\r\nfurther modification and another definition to render them perfectly\r\nnatural.\r\n\r\nThe discovery (in the year 1871) of a living representative of a genus\r\nhitherto believed to be long extinct, _Ceratodus_, threw a new light on\r\nthe affinities of fishes. The writer of the present article, who had the\r\ngood fortune to examine this fish, was enabled to show that, on the one\r\nhand, it was a form most closely allied to _Lepidosiren_, and, on the\r\nother, that it could not be separated from the Ganoid fishes, and\r\ntherefore that _Lepidosiren_ also was a Ganoid,--a relation already\r\nindicated by Huxley in a previous paper on \"Devonian Fishes.\"\r\n\r\nHaving followed the development of the ichthyological system down to\r\nthis period, we now enumerate the most important contributions to\r\nichthyology which appeared contemporaneously with or subsequently to the\r\npublication of the great work of Cuvier and Valenciennes.

HISTORY AND LITERATURE FROM 1880\r\n\r\nIn the systematic account which followed the above chapter in the 9th\r\nedition of the _Encyclopaedia Britannica_, the following classification,\r\nwhich is the same as that given in the author's _Introduction to the\r\nStudy of Fishes_ (London, 1880) was adopted by Albert Günther:--\r\n\r\n  Subclass I. : PALAEICHTHYES.\r\n    Order I. : _Chondropterygii._\r\n      With two suborders : Plagiostomata and Holocephala.\r\n    Order II. : _Ganoidei._\r\n      With eight suborders : Placodermi, Acanthodini, Dipnoi,\r\n        Chondrostei, Polypteroidei, Pycnodontoidei, Lepidosteoidei,\r\n        Amioidei.\r\n\r\n  Subclass II. : TELEOSTEI.\r\n    Order I. : _Acanthopterygii._\r\n      With the divisions Perciformes, Beryciformes, Kurtiformes,\r\n        Polynemiformes, Sciaeniformes, Xiphiiformes, Trichiuriformes,\r\n        Cotto-Scombriformes, Gobiiformes, Blenniformes, Mugiliformes,\r\n        Gastrosteiformes, Centrisciformes, Gobiesociformes, Channiformes,\r\n        Labyrinthibranchii, Lophotiformes, Taeniiformes and\r\n        Notacanthiformes.\r\n    Order II. : _Acanthopterygii Pharyngognathi._\r\n    Order III. : _Anacanthini._\r\n      With two divisions : Gadoidei and Pleuronectoidei.\r\n    Order IV. : _Physostomi._\r\n    Order V. : _Lophobranchii._\r\n    Order VI. : _Plectognathi._\r\n\r\n  Subclass III. : CYCLOSTOMATA.\r\n\r\n  Subclass IV. : LEPTOGARDII.\r\n\r\nIt was an artificial system, in which the most obvious relationships of\r\nthe higher groups were lost sight of, and the results of the already\r\nfairly advanced study of the fossil forms to a great extent discarded.\r\nThis system gave rise to much adverse criticism; as T. H. Huxley\r\nforcibly put it in a paper published soon after (1883), opposing the\r\ndivision of the main groups into Palaeichthyes and Teleostei:\r\n\"Assuredly, if there is any such distinction to be drawn on the basis of\r\nour present knowledge among the higher fishes, it is between the Ganoids\r\nand the Plagiostomes, and not between the Ganoids and the Teleosteans\";\r\nat the same time expressing his conviction, \"first, that there are no\r\ntwo large groups of animals for which the evidence of a direct genetic\r\nconnexion is better than in the case of the Ganoids and the Teleosteans;\r\nand secondly, that the proposal to separate the Elasmobranchii\r\n(Chondropterygii of Günther), Ganoidei and Dipnoi of Müller into a group\r\napart from, and equivalent to, the Teleostei appears to be inconsistent\r\nwith the plainest relations of these fishes.\" This verdict has been\r\nendorsed by all subsequent workers at the classification of fishes.\r\n\r\nGünther's classification would have been vastly improved had he made\r\nuse of a contribution published as early as 1871, but not referred to by\r\nhim. As not even a passing allusion is made to it in the previous\r\nchapter, we must retrace our steps to make good this striking omission.\r\nEdward Drinker Cope (1840-1897) was a worker of great originality and\r\nrelentless energy, who, in the sixties of the last century, inspired by\r\nthe doctrine of evolution, was one of the first to apply its principles\r\nto the classification of vertebrates. Equally versed in recent and\r\nfossil zoology, and endowed with a marvellous gift, or \"instinct\" for\r\nperceiving the relationship of animals, he has done a great deal for the\r\nadvance of our knowledge of mammals, reptiles and fishes. Although often\r\ncareless in the working out of details and occasionally a little too\r\nbold in his deductions, Cope occupies a high rank among the zoologists\r\nof the 19th century, and much of his work has stood the test of time.\r\n\r\nThe following was Cope's classification, 1871 (_Tr. Amer. Philos. Soc._\r\nxiv. 449).\r\n\r\n  Subclass  I. Holocephali.\r\n     \"     II. Selachii.\r\n     \"    III. Dipnoi.\r\n     \"     IV. Crossopterygia, with two orders: Haplistia and Cladistia.\r\n     \"      V. Actinopteri.\r\n\r\nThe latter is subdivided in the following manner:--\r\n\r\n  Tribe I. : Chondrostei.\r\n    Two orders : Selachostomi and Glaniostomi.\r\n  Tribe II. : Physostomi.\r\n    Twelve orders: Ginglymodi, Halecomorphi, Nematognathi, Scyphophori,\r\n      Plectospondyli, Isospondyli, Haplomi, Glanencheli, Ichthyocephali,\r\n      Holostomi, Enchelycephali, Colocephali.\r\n  Tribe III. : Physoclysti.\r\n    Ten orders : Opisthomi, Percesoces, Synentognathi, Hemibranchii,\r\n      Lophobranchii, Pediculati, Heterosomata, Plectognathi, Percomorphi,\r\n      Pharyngognathi.\r\n\r\nAlongside with so much that is good in this classification, there are\r\nmany suggestions which cannot be regarded as improvements on the views\r\nof previous workers. Attaching too great an importance to the mode of\r\nsuspension of the mandible, Cope separated the Holocephali from the\r\nSelachii and the Dipnoi from the Crossopterygii, thus obscuring the\r\ngeneral agreement which binds these groups to each other, whilst there\r\nis an evident want of proportion in the five subclasses. The exclusion\r\nfrom the class Pisces of the Leptocardii, or lancelets, as first\r\nadvocated by E. Haeckel, was a step in the right direction, whilst that\r\nof the Cyclostomes does not seem called for to such an authority as R.\r\nH. Traquair, with whom the writer of this review entirely concurs.\r\n\r\nThe group of Crossopterygians, first separated as a family from the\r\nother Ganoids by Huxley, constituted a fortunate innovation, and so was\r\nits division into two minor groups, by which the existing forms\r\n(_Polypteroidei_) were separated as Cladistia. The divisions of the\r\nActinopteri, which includes all Teleostomes other than the Dipneusti and\r\nCrossopterygii also showed, on the whole, a correct appreciation of\r\ntheir relationships, the Chondrostei being well separated from the other\r\nGanoids with which they were generally associated. In the groupings of\r\nthe minor divisions, which Cope termed orders, we had a decided\r\nimprovement on the Cuvierian-Müllerian classification, the author having\r\nutilized many suggestions of his fellow countrymen Theodore Gill, who\r\nhas done much towards a better understanding of their relationships. In\r\nthe association of the Characinids with the Cyprinids (Plectospondyli)\r\nin the separation of the flat-fishes from the Ganoids, in the\r\napproximation of the Lophobranchs to the sticklebacks and of the\r\nPlectognaths to the Acanthopterygians, and in many other points, Cope\r\nwas in advance of his time, and it is to be regretted that his\r\ncontemporaries did not more readily take up many of his excellent\r\nsuggestions for the improvement of their systems.\r\n\r\nIn the subsequent period of his very active scientific life, Cope made\r\nmany alterations to his system, the latest scheme published by him being\r\nthe following (\"Synopsis of the families of Vertebrata,\" _Amer. Natur._,\r\n1889, p. 849):--\r\n\r\n  Class : Agnatha.\r\n      I. Subclass : OSTRACODERMI.\r\n           Orders : Arrhina, Diplorrhina.\r\n     II. Subclass : MARSIPOBRANCHII.\r\n           Orders : Hyperotreti, Hyperoarti.\r\n\r\n  Class : Pisces.\r\n      I. Subclass : HOLOCEPHALI.\r\n     II. Subclass : DIPNOI.\r\n    III. Subclass : ELASMOBRANCHII.\r\n           Orders : Ichthyotomi, Selachii.\r\n     IV. Subclass : TELEOSTOMI.\r\n          (i.) Superorder : _Rhipidopterygia._\r\n                 Orders : Rhipidistia, Actinistia.\r\n         (ii.) Superorder : _Crossopterygia._\r\n                 Orders : Placodermi, Haplistia, Taxistia, Cladistia.\r\n        (iii.) Superorder : _Podopterygia_ (Chondrostei).\r\n         (iv.) Superorder : _Actinopterygia._\r\n                 Orders : Physostomi, Physoclysti.\r\n\r\nThis classification is that followed, with many emendations, by A. S.\r\nWoodward in his epoch-making _Catalogue of Fossil Fishes_ (4 vols.,\r\nLondon, 1889-1901), and in his most useful _Outlines of Vertebrate\r\nPaleontology_ (Cambridge, 1898), and was adopted by Günther in the 10th\r\nedition of the _Encyclopaedia Britannica_:--\r\n\r\n  Class : Agnatha.\r\n     I. Subclass : CYCLOSTOMI.\r\n          With three orders : (a) _Hyperoartia_ (Lampreys); (b)\r\n            _Hyperotreti_ (Myxinoids); (c) _Cycliae_ (Palaeospondylus).\r\n    II. Subclass : OSTRACODERMI.\r\n          With four orders : (a) _Heterostraci_ (Coelolepidae,\r\n            Psammosteidae, Drepanaspidae, Pteraspidae); (b) _Osteostraci_\r\n            (Cephalaspidae, Ateleaspidae, &c.); (c) Antiarchi\r\n            (Asterolepidae, Pterichthys, Bothrolepis, &c.); (d) Anaspida\r\n            (Birkeniidae).\r\n\r\n  Class : Pisces.\r\n     I. Subclass : ELASMOBRANCHII.\r\n          With four orders : (a) _Pleuropterygii_ (Cladoselache); (b)\r\n            _Ichthyotomi_ (Pleuracanthidae); (c) _Acanthodii_\r\n            (Diplacanthidae, and Acanthodidae); (d) _Selachii_ (divided\r\n            from the structure of the vertebral centres into\r\n            Asterospondyli and Tectospondyli).\r\n    II. Subclass : HOLOCEPHALI.\r\n          With one order : _Chimaeroidei._\r\n   III. Subclass : DIPNOI.\r\n          With two orders : (a) _Sirenoidei_ (Lepidosiren, Ceratodus,\r\n            Uronemidae, Ctenodontidae); (b) _Arthrodira_ (Homosteus,\r\n            Coccosteus, Dinichthys).\r\n    IV. Subclass : TELEOSTOMI.\r\n          A. Order : _Crossopterygii._\r\n             With four suborders: (1) _Haplistia_ (Tarassius); (2)\r\n               _Rhipidistia_ (Holoptychidae, Rhizodontidae, Osteolepidae);\r\n               (3) _Actinistia_ (Coelacanthidae); (4) _Cladistia_\r\n               (Polypterus).\r\n          B. Order : _Actinopterygii._\r\n             With about twenty suborders: (1) _Chondrostei_\r\n               (Palaeoniscidae, Platysomidae, Chondrosteidae, Sturgeons);\r\n               (2) _Protospondyli_ (Semionotidae, Macrosemiidae,\r\n               Pycnodontidae, Eugnathidae, Amiidae, Pachycormidae); (3)\r\n               _Aetheospondyli_ (Aspidorhynchidae, Lepidosteidae); (4)\r\n               _Isospondyli_ (Pholidophoridae, Osteoglossidae, Clupeidae,\r\n               Leptolepidae, &c.); (5) _Plectospondyli_ (Cyprinidae,\r\n               Characinidae); (6) _Nematognathi_; (7) _Apodes_; and the\r\n               other Teleosteans.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, grave objections to this system, which cannot be\r\nsaid to reflect the present state of our knowledge. In his masterly\r\npaper on the evolution of the Dipneusti, L. Dollo has conclusively shown\r\nthat the importance of the autostyly on which the definition of the\r\nHolocephali from the Elasmobranchii or Selachii and of the Dipneusti\r\nfrom the Teleostomi rested, had been exaggerated, and that therefore the\r\nposition assigned to these two groups in Günther's classification of\r\n1880 still commended itself. Recent work on _Palaeospondylus_, on the\r\nOstracoderms, and on the Arthrodira, throws great doubt on the propriety\r\nof the positions given to them in the above classification, and the rank\r\nassigned to the main divisions of the Teleostomi do not commend\r\nthemselves to the writer of the present article, who would divide the\r\nfishes into three subclasses:--\r\n\r\n    I. Cyclostomi\r\n   II. Selachii\r\n  III. Teleostomi,\r\n\r\nthe characters and contents of which will be found in separate\r\narticles; in the present state of uncertainty as to their position,\r\n_Palaeospondylus_ and the _Ostracodermi_ are best placed _hors cadre_\r\nand will be dealt with under these names.\r\n\r\nThe three subclasses here adopted correspond exactly with those proposed\r\nin Theo. Gill's classification of the recent fishes (\"Families and\r\nSubfamilies of Fishes,\" _Mem. Nat. Ac. Sci._ vi. 1893), except that they\r\nare regarded by that authority as classes.\r\n\r\nThe period dealt with in this chapter, ushered in by the publication of\r\nGünther's _Introduction to the Study of Fishes_, has been one of\r\nextraordinary activity in every branch of ichthyology, recent and\r\nfossil. A glance at the _Zoological Record_, published by the Zoological\r\nSociety of London, will show the ever-increasing number of monographs,\r\nmorphological papers and systematic contributions, which appear year\r\nafter year. The number of new genera and species which are being\r\nproposed is amazing, but it is difficult to tell how many of them will\r\nsimply go to swell the already overburdened synonymy. Perhaps a\r\nreasonable estimate of the living species known at the present day would\r\nassess their number at about 13,000.\r\n\r\nIt is much to be regretted that there is not a single general modern\r\nsystematic work on fishes. The most important treatises, the 7th volume\r\nof the _Cambridge Natural History_, by T. W. Bridge and G. A. Boulenger,\r\nand D. S. Jordan's _Guide to the Study of Fishes_, only profess to give\r\ndefinitions of the families with enumerations of the principal genera.\r\nGünther's _Catalogue of the Fishes in the British Museum_ therefore\r\nremains the only general descriptive treatise, but its last volume dates\r\nfrom 1870, and the work is practically obsolete. A second edition of it\r\nwas begun in 1894, but only one volume, by Boulenger, has appeared, and\r\nthe subject is so vast that it seems doubtful now whether any one will\r\never have the time and energy to repeat Günther's achievement. The fish\r\nfauna of the different parts of the world will have to be dealt with\r\nseparately, and it is in this direction that descriptive ichthyology is\r\nmost likely to progress.\r\n\r\nNorth America, the fishes of which were imperfectly known in 1880, now\r\npossesses a _Descriptive Catalogue_ in 4 stout volumes, by D. S. Jordan\r\nand B. W. Evermann, replacing the synopsis brought out in 1882 by D. S.\r\nJordan and C. H. Gilbert. A similar treatise should embrace all the\r\nfresh-water species of Africa, the fishes of the two principal river\r\nsystems, the Nile and the Congo, having recently been worked out by G.\r\nA. Boulenger. Japanese ichthyology has been taken in hand by D. S.\r\nJordan and his pupils.\r\n\r\nThe fishes of the deep sea have been the subject of extensive monographs\r\nby L. Vaillant (_Travailleur_ and _Talisman_), A. Günther\r\n(_Challenger_), A. Alcock (_Investigator_), R. Collett (_Hirondelle_),\r\nS. Garman (_Albatross_) and a general résumé up to 1895 was provided in\r\nG. B. Goode's and T. H. Bean's _Oceanic Ichthyology_. More than 600 true\r\nbathybial fishes are known from depths of 1000 fathoms and more, and a\r\ngreat deal of evidence has been accumulated to show the general\r\ntransition of the surface fauna into the bathybial.\r\n\r\nA recent departure has been the exploration of the Antarctic fauna.\r\nThree general reports, on the results of the _Southern Cross_, the\r\n_Belgica_ and the Swedish _South Polar_ expeditions, had already been\r\npublished in 1907, and others on the _Scotia_ and _Discovery_ were in\r\npreparation. No very striking new types of fishes have been discovered,\r\nbut the results obtained are sufficient to entirely disprove the theory\r\nof bipolarity which some naturalists had advocated. Much has been done\r\ntowards ascertaining the life-histories of the fishes of economic\r\nimportance, both in Europe and in North America, and our knowledge of\r\nthe larval and post-larval forms has made great progress.\r\n\r\nWonderful activity has been displayed in the field of palaeontology, and\r\nthe careful working out of the morphology of the archaic types has led\r\nto a better understanding of the general lines of evolution; but it is\r\nto be regretted that very little light on the relationships of the\r\nliving groups of Teleosteans has been thrown by the discoveries of\r\npalaeontologists.\r\n\r\nAmong the most remarkable additions made in recent years, the work of R.\r\nH. Traquair on the problematic fishes _Palaeospondylus_, _Thelodus_,\r\n_Drepanaspis_, _Lanarkia_, _Ateleaspis_, _Birkenia_ and _Lanasius_,\r\nranks foremost; next to it must be placed the researches of A. S.\r\nWoodward and Bashford Dean on the primitive shark _Cladoselache_, and of\r\nthe same authors, J. S. Newberry, C. R. Eastman, E. W. Claypole and L.\r\nHussakof, on the Arthrodira, a group the affinities of which have been\r\nmuch discussed.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--The following selection from the extremely extensive\r\n  ichthyological literature which has appeared during the period\r\n  1880-1906 will supplement the bibliographical notice appended to\r\n  section I.

ITS PRINCIPAL DIVISIONS\r\n\r\nFishes, constituting the class _Pisces_, may be defined as Craniate\r\nVertebrata, or Chordata, in which the anterior portion of the central\r\nnervous system is expanded into a brain surrounded by an unsegmented\r\nportion of the axial skeleton; which are provided with a heart,\r\nbreathing through gills; and in which the limbs, if present, are in the\r\nform of fins, as opposed to the pentadactyle, structure common to the\r\nother Vertebrata. With the exception of a few forms in which lungs are\r\npresent in addition to the gills, thus enabling the animal to breathe\r\natmospheric air for more or less considerable periods (Dipneusti), all\r\nfishes are aquatic throughout their existence.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the paired limbs, median fins are usually present,\r\nconsisting of dermal rays borne by endoskeletal supports, which in the\r\nmore primitive forms are strikingly similar in structure to the paired\r\nfins that are assumed to have arisen from the breaking up of a lateral\r\nfold similar to the vertical folds out of which the dorsal, anal and\r\ncaudal fins have been evolved. The body is naked, or scaly, or covered\r\nwith bony shields or hard spines.\r\n\r\nLeaving aside the Ostracophori, which are dealt with in a separate\r\narticle, the fishes may be divided into three subclasses--\r\n\r\nI. Cyclostomi or Marsipobranchii, with the skull imperfectly developed,\r\nwithout jaws, with a single nasal aperture, without paired fins, and\r\nwith an unpaired fin without dermal rays. Lampreys and hag-fishes.\r\n\r\nII. Selachii or Chondropterygii, with the skull well developed but\r\nwithout membrane bones, with paired nasal apertures, with median and\r\npaired fins, the ventrals bearing prehensile organs (claspers) in the\r\nmales. Sharks, skates and chimaeras.\r\n\r\nIII. Teleostomi, with the skull well developed and with membrane bones,\r\nwith paired nasal apertures, primarily with median and paired fins,\r\nincluding all other fishes.     (G. A. B.)\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. ANATOMY[1]\r\n\r\nThe special importance of a study of the anatomy of fishes lies in the\r\nfact that fishes are on the whole undoubtedly the most archaic of\r\nexisting craniates, and it is therefore to them especially that we must\r\nlook for evidence as to the evolutionary history of morphological\r\nfeatures occurring in the higher groups of vertebrates.\r\n\r\nIn making a general survey of the morphology of fishes it is essential\r\nto take into consideration the structure of the young developing\r\nindividual (embryology) as well as that of the adult (comparative\r\nanatomy in the narrow sense). Palaeontology is practically dumb\r\nexcepting as regards external form and skeletal features, and even of\r\nthese our knowledge must for long be in a hopelessly imperfect state.\r\nWhile it is of the utmost importance to pay due attention to\r\nembryological data it is equally important to consider them critically\r\nand in conjunction with broad morphological considerations. Taken by\r\nthemselves they are apt to be extremely misleading.\r\n\r\n_External Features._--The external features of a typical fish are\r\nintimately associated with its mode of life. Its shape is more or less\r\nthat of a spindle; its surface is covered with a highly glandular\r\nepidermis, which is constantly producing lubricating mucus through the\r\nagency of which skin-friction is reduced to an extraordinary degree; and\r\nfinally it possesses a set of remarkable propelling organs or fins.\r\n\r\n  The exact shape varies greatly from the typical spindle shape with\r\n  variations in the mode of life; e.g. bottom-living fishes may be much\r\n  flattened from above downwards as in the rays, or from side to side in\r\n  the Pleuronectids such as flounder, plaice or sole, or the shape may\r\n  be much elongated as in the eels.\r\n\r\n_Head, Trunk and Tail._--In the body of the fish we may recognize the\r\nthree main sub-divisions of the body--head, trunk and tail--as in the\r\nhigher vertebrates, but there is no definite narrowing of the anterior\r\nregion to form a neck such as occurs in the higher groups, though a\r\nsuspicion of such a narrowing occurs in the young _Lepidosiren_.\r\n\r\nThe tail, or postanal region, is probably a secondary development--a\r\nprolongation of the hinder end of the body for motor purposes. This is\r\nindicated by the fact that it frequently develops late in ontogeny.\r\n\r\n  The vertebrate, in correlation perhaps with its extreme cephalization,\r\n  develops from before backwards (except the alimentary canal, which\r\n  develops more _en bloc_), there remaining at the hind end for a\r\n  prolonged period a mass of undifferentiated embryonic tissue from the\r\n  anterior side of which the definitive tissues are constantly being\r\n  developed. After development has reached the level of the anus it\r\n  still continues backwards and the tail region is formed, showing a\r\n  continuation of the same tissues as in front, notochord, nerve cord,\r\n  gut, myotomes. Of these the (postanal) gut soon undergoes atrophy.\r\n\r\n_Fins._--The fins are extensions of the body surface which serve for\r\npropulsion. To give the necessary rigidity they are provided with\r\nspecial skeletal elements, while to give mobility they are provided with\r\nspecial muscles. These muscles, like the other voluntary muscles of the\r\nbody, are derived from the primitive myotomes and are therefore\r\nsegmental in origin. The fins are divisible into two main\r\ncategories--the median or unpaired fins and the paired fins.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--Heterocercal Tail of _Acipenser_. a, Modified\r\nmedian scales (\"fulcra\"); b, bony plates.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From _Cambridge Natural History_, vol. vii., \"Fishes,\r\n&c.,\" by permission of Messrs. Macmillan & Co., Ltd.\r\n\r\nFIG. 2.--_Cladoselache._ (After Dean.)]\r\n\r\nThe median fins are to be regarded as the more primitive. The\r\nfundamental structure of the vertebrate, with its median skeletal axis\r\nand its great muscular mass divided into segments along each side of the\r\nbody, indicates that its primitive method of movement was by waves of\r\nlateral flexure, as seen in an Amphioxus, a cyclostome or an eel. The\r\nsystem of median fins consists in the first instance of a continuous\r\nfin-fold extending round the posterior end of the body--as persists even\r\nin the adult in the existing Dipneusti. A continuous median fin-fold\r\noccurs also in various Teleosts (many deep-sea Teleosts, eels, &c.),\r\nthough the highly specialized features in other respects make it\r\nprobable that we have here to do with a secondary return to a condition\r\nlike the primitive one. In the process of segmentation of the originally\r\ncontinuous fin-fold we notice first of all a separation of and an\r\nincrease in size of that portion of the fin which from its position at\r\nthe tip of the tail region is in the most advantageous position for\r\nproducing movements of the body. There is thus formed the _caudal_ fin.\r\nIn this region there is a greatly increased size of the fin-fold--both\r\ndorsally and ventrally. There is further developed a highly\r\ncharacteristic asymmetry. In the original symmetrical or _protocercal_ (\r\n= _diphycercal_) type of tail (as seen in a cyclostome, a Dipnoan and in\r\nmost fish embryos) the skeletal axis of the body runs straight out to\r\nits tip--the tail fold being equally developed above and below the axis.\r\nIn the highly developed caudal fin of the majority of fishes, however,\r\nthe fin-fold is developed to a much greater extent on the ventral side,\r\nand correlated with this the skeletal axis is turned upwards as in the\r\n_heterocercal_ tail of sharks and sturgeons. The highest stage in this\r\nevolution of the caudal fin is seen in the Teleostean fishes, where the\r\nventral tail-fold becomes developed to such an extent as to produce a\r\nsecondarily symmetrical appearance (_homocercal_ tail, fig. 4).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From _\"Challenger\" Reports Zool._, published by H.M.\r\nStationery Office.\r\n\r\nFIG. 3.--_Chlamydoselachus_. (After Günther.)]\r\n\r\n  The sharks have been referred to as possessing heterocercal tails,\r\n  but, though this is true of the majority, within the limits of the\r\n  group all three types of tail-fin occur, from the protocercal tail of\r\n  the fossil Pleuracanthids and the living _Chlamydoselachus_ to the\r\n  highly developed, practically homocercal tail of the ancient\r\n  _Cladoselache_(fig. 2).\r\n\r\nThe praecaudal portion of the fin-fold on the dorsal side of the body\r\nbecomes broken into numerous finlets in living Crossopterygians, while\r\nin other fishes it disappears throughout part of its length, leaving\r\nonly one, two or three enlarged portions--the _dorsal_ fins (fig. 4,\r\nd.f.). Similarly the praecaudal part of the fin-fold ventrally becomes\r\nreduced to a single _anal_ fin (a.f.), occasionally continued backwards\r\nby a series of finlets (_Scombridae_). In the sucker-fishes (_Remora_,\r\n_Eckeneis_) the anterior dorsal fin is metamorphosed into a sucker by\r\nwhich the creature attaches itself to larger fishes, turtles, &c.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From _Cambridge Natural History_, vol. vii., \"Fishes,\r\n&c.,\" by permission of Messrs.

There are two main types of\r\npaired fin--the _archipterygial_ type, a paddle-like structure supported\r\nby a jointed axis which bears lateral rays and exists in an unmodified\r\nform in _Neoceratodus_ alone amongst living fishes, and the\r\n_actinopterygial_ type, supported by fine raylike structures as seen in\r\nthe fins of any ordinary fish. The relatively less efficiency of the\r\narchipterygium and its predominance amongst the more ancient forms of\r\nfishes point to its being the more archaic of these two types.\r\n\r\nIn the less highly specialized groups of fishes the pectoral fins are\r\nclose behind the head, the pelvic fins in the region of the cloacal\r\nopening. In the more specialized forms the pelvic fins frequently show a\r\nmore or less extensive shifting towards the head, so that their position\r\nis described as thoracic (fig. 4) or jugular (_Gadus_--cod, haddock,\r\n&c., fig. 5).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--Burbot (_Lota vulgaris_), with jugular ventral\r\nfins.]\r\n\r\n  The median fin, especially in its caudal section, is the main\r\n  propelling organ: the paired fins in the majority of fishes serve for\r\n  balancing. In the Dipneusti the paired fins are used for clambering\r\n  about amidst vegetation, much in the same fashion as the limbs of\r\n  Urodeles. In _Ceratodus_ they also function as paddles. In various\r\n  Teleosts the pectoral fins have acquired secondarily a leg-like\r\n  function, being used for creeping or skipping over the mud\r\n  (_Periophthalmus_; cf. also Trigloids, Scorpaenids and Pediculati). In\r\n  the \"flying\" fishes the pectoral fins are greatly enlarged and are\r\n  used as aeroplanes, their quivering movements frequently giving a\r\n  (probably erroneous) impression of voluntary flapping movements. In\r\n  the gobies and lumpsuckers (_Cyclopteridae_) the pelvic fins are fused\r\n  to form an adhesive sucker; in the _Gobiesocidae_ they take part in\r\n  the formation of a somewhat similar sucker.\r\n\r\n  The evolutionary history of the paired limbs forms a fascinating\r\n  chapter in vertebrate morphology. As regards their origin two\r\n  hypotheses have attracted special attention: (1) that enunciated by\r\n  Gegenbaur, according to which the limb is a modified gill septum, and\r\n  (2) that supported by James K. Thacher, F. M. Balfour, St George\r\n  Mivart and others, that the paired fins are persisting and modified\r\n  portions of a once continuous fin-fold on each side of the body. The\r\n  majority of morphologists are now inclined to accept the second of\r\n  these views. Each has been supported by plausible arguments, for which\r\n  reference must be made to the literature of the subject.[2] Both views\r\n  rest upon the assumed occurrence of stages for the existence of which\r\n  there is no direct evidence, viz. in the case of (1) transitional\r\n  stages between gill septum and limb, and in the case of (2) a\r\n  continuous lateral fin-fold. (There is no evidence that the lateral\r\n  row of spines in the acanthodian _Climatius_ has any other than a\r\n  defensive significance.) In the opinion of the writer of this article,\r\n  such assumptions are without justification, now that our knowledge of\r\n  Dipnoan and Crossopterygian and Urodele embryology points towards the\r\n  former possession by the primitive vertebrate of a series of\r\n  projecting, voluntarily movable, and hence potentially motor structure\r\n  on each side of the body. It must be emphasized that these--the true\r\n  external gills--are the _only_ organs known actually to exist in\r\n  vertebrates which might readily be transformed into limbs. When\r\n  insuperable objections are adduced to this having actually taken place\r\n  in the course of evolution, it will be time enough to fall back upon\r\n  purely hypothetical ancestral structures on which to base the\r\n  evolutionary history of the limbs.\r\n\r\nThe ectoderm covering the general surface is highly glandular. In the\r\ncase of the Dipneusti, flask-shaped multicellular glands like those of\r\nAmphibians occur in addition to the scattered gland cells.\r\n\r\n  A characteristic feature of glandular activity is the production of a\r\n  slight electrical disturbance. In the case of _Malopterurus_ this\r\n  elsewhere subsidiary function of the skin has become so exaggerated as\r\n  to lead to the conversion of the skin of each side of the body into a\r\n  powerful electrical organ.[3] Each of these consists of some two\r\n  million small chambers, each containing an electric disk and all\r\n  deriving their nerve supply from the branches of a single enormous\r\n  axis cylinder. This takes its origin from a gigantic ganglion cell\r\n  situated latero-dorsally in the spinal cord between the levels of the\r\n  first and second spinal nerves.\r\n\r\n_Cement Organs._--The larvae of certain Teleostomes and Dipnoans possess\r\nspecial glandular organs in the head region for the secretion of a\r\nsticky cement by which the young fish is able to attach itself to\r\nwater-plants or other objects. As a rule these are ectodermal in origin;\r\ne.g. in _Lepidosiren_ and _Protopterus_[4] the crescentic cement organ\r\nlying ventrally behind the mouth consists of a glandular thickening of\r\nthe deep layer of the ectoderm. In young ganoid fishes preoral cement\r\norgans occur. In Crossopterygians there is one cup-shaped structure on\r\neach side immediately in front of the mouth. Here the glandular\r\nepithelium is endodermal, developed[5] as an outgrowth from the wall of\r\nthe alimentary canal, closely resembling a gill pouch. In _Amia_[6] the\r\nsame appears to be the case. In a few Teleosts similar organs occur,\r\ne.g. _Sarcodaces_, _Hyperopisus_,[7] where so far as is known they are\r\nectodermal.\r\n\r\n_Photogenic Organs._--The slimy secretion produced by the epidermal\r\nglands of fishes contains in some cases substances which apparently\r\nreadily undergo a slow process of oxidation, giving out light of low\r\nwave-length in the process and so giving rise to a phosphorescent\r\nappearance. In many deep-sea fishes this property of producing\r\nlight-emitting secretion has undergone great development, leading to the\r\nexistence of definite photogenic organs. These vary much in character,\r\nand much remains to be done in working out their minute structure. Good\r\nexamples are seen in the Teleostean family _Scopelidae_, where they form\r\nbrightly shining eye-like spots scattered about the surface of the body,\r\nespecially towards the ventral side.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From _Trans. Zool. Soc. of London_.\r\n\r\nFIG. 6.--Larva of Polypterus. (After Budgett.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From _Phil. Transactions, Royal Society of London_.\r\n\r\nFIG. 7.--Thirty Days' Larval Lepidosiren. (After Graham Kerr.)]\r\n\r\n_External Gills._--In young Crossopterygians and in the young\r\n_Protopterus_ and _Lepidosiren_ true external gills occur of the same\r\nmorphological nature as those of Urodele amphibians. In Crossopterygians\r\na single one is present on each side on the hyoid arch; in the two\r\nDipnoans mentioned four are present on each side--on visceral arches\r\nIII., IV., V. and VI. (It may be recalled that in Urodeles they occur on\r\narches III., IV. and V., with vestiges[8] on arches I. and II.). Each\r\nexternal gill develops as a projection of ectoderm with mesodermal core\r\nnear the upper end of its visceral arch; the main aortic arch is\r\nprolonged into it as a loop. When fully developed it is pinnate, and is\r\nprovided with voluntary muscles by which it can be moved freely to renew\r\nthe water in contact with its respiratory surface. In the case of\r\n_Polypterus_ a short rod of cartilage projects from the hyoid arch into\r\nthe base of the external gill. Their occurrence with identical main\r\nfeatures in the three groups mentioned indicates that the external gills\r\nare important and archaic organs of the vertebrata. Their non-occurrence\r\nin at least some of the groups where they are absent is to be explained\r\nby the presence of a large vascular yolk sac, which necessarily fulfils\r\nin a very efficient way the respiratory function.\r\n\r\n_Alimentary Canal._--The alimentary canal forms a tube traversing the\r\nbody from mouth to cloacal opening. Corresponding with structural and\r\nfunctional differences it is for descriptive purposes divided into the\r\nfollowing regions--(1) Buccal cavity or mouth cavity, (2) Pharynx, (3)\r\nOesophagus or gullet, (4) Stomach, (5) Intestine, and (6) Cloaca. The\r\nbuccal cavity or mouth cavity is morphologically a stomodaeum, i.e. it\r\nrepresents an inpushing of the external surface. Its opening to the\r\nexterior is wide and gaping in the embryo in certain groups (Selachians\r\nand Crossopterygians), and even in the adult among the Cyclostomata, but\r\nin the adult Gnathostome it can be voluntarily opened and shut in\r\ncorrelation with the presence of a hinged jaw apparatus. The mouth\r\nopening is less or more ventral in position in Cyclostomes and\r\nSelachians, while in Dipnoans and Teleostomes it is usually terminal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From Bridge, _Cambridge Natural History_, vol. vii.,\r\n\"Fishes, &c.\" (by permisson of Macmillan & Co., Ltd.).

It is especially characteristic of fishes that a number of these\r\nclefts remain open as functional breathing organs in the adult.\r\n\r\nThe visceral clefts arise as hollow pouches (or at first solid\r\nprojections) of the endoderm. Each pouch fuses with the ectoderm at its\r\nouter end and then becomes perforated so as to form a free communication\r\nbetween pharynx and exterior.\r\n\r\nThe mesenchymatous packing tissue between consecutive clefts forms the\r\nvisceral arches, and local condensation within each gives rise to\r\nimportant skeletal elements--to which the name visceral arches is often\r\nrestricted. From the particular skeletal structures which develop in the\r\nvisceral arches bounding it the anterior cleft is known as the\r\nhyomandibular cleft, the next one as hyobranchial. In common usage the\r\nhyomandibular cleft is called the spiracle, and the series of clefts\r\nbehind it the branchial clefts.\r\n\r\nThe typical functional gill cleft forms a vertical slit, having on each\r\nside a gill septum which separates it from its neighbours in the series.\r\nThe lining of the gill cleft possesses over a less or greater extent of\r\nits area a richly developed network of capillary blood-vessels, through\r\nthe thin covering of which the respiratory exchange takes place between\r\nthe blood and the water which washes through the gill cleft. The area of\r\nrespiratory surface tends to become increased by the development of\r\noutgrowths. Frequently these take the form of regular plate-like\r\nstructures known as gill lamellae. In the Selachians these lamellae are\r\nstrap-like structures (_Elasmobranch_) attached along nearly their\r\nwhole length to the gill septum as shown in fig. 8, A. In the\r\nHolocephali and in the sturgeon the outer portions of the gill septa\r\nhave disappeared and this leads to the condition seen in the higher\r\nTeleostomes (fig. 8, B), where the whole of the septum has disappeared\r\nexcept its thick inner edge containing the skeletal arch. It follows\r\nthat in these higher Teleostomes--including the ordinary Teleosts--the\r\ngill lamellae are attached only at their extreme inner end.\r\n\r\n  In the young of Selachians and certain Teleosts (e.g. _Gymnarchus_ and\r\n  _Heterotis_)[10] the gill lamellae are prolonged as filaments which\r\n  project freely to the exterior. These must not be confused with true\r\n  external gills.\r\n\r\nThe partial atrophy of the gill septa in the Teleostomes produces an\r\nimportant change in their appearance. Whereas in the Selachian a series\r\nof separate gill clefts is seen in external view each covered by a soft\r\nvalvular backgrowth of its anterior lip, in the Teleostean fish, on the\r\nother hand, a single large opening is seen on each side (opercular\r\nopening) covered over by the enormously enlarged valvular flap belonging\r\nto the anterior lip of the hyobranchial cleft. This flap, an outgrowth\r\nof the hyoid arch, is known as the operculum.\r\n\r\nIn the Teleostomi there are usually five functional clefts, but these\r\nare the survivors of a formerly greater number. Evidence of reduction is\r\nseen at both ends of the series. In front of the first functional cleft\r\n(the hyobranchial) there is laid down in the embryo the rudiment of a\r\nspiracular cleft. In the less highly organized fishes this survives in\r\nmany cases as an open cleft.\r\n\r\n  In many sharks and in sturgeons the spiracle forms a conspicuous\r\n  opening just behind the eye. In rays and skates, which are modified in\r\n  correlation with their ground feeding habit, the spiracle is a large\r\n  opening which during the great widening out of the body during\r\n  development comes to be situated on the dorsal side, while the\r\n  branchial clefts come to be ventral in position. In existing\r\n  Crossopterygians the spiracle is a slit-like opening on the dorsal\r\n  side of the head which can be opened or closed at will. In Dipneusti,\r\n  as in the higher Teleostomes, the spiracle is found as an embryonic\r\n  rudiment, but in this case it gives rise in the adult to a remarkable\r\n  sense organ of problematical function.[11]\r\n\r\nTraces of what appear to be pre-spiracular clefts exist in the embryos\r\nof various forms. Perhaps the most remarkable of these is to be found in\r\nthe larval Crossopterygian,[12] and apparently also in _Amia_[13] at\r\nleast, amongst the other ganoids, where a pair of entodermal pouches\r\nbecome cut off from the main entoderm and, establishing an opening to\r\nthe exterior, give rise to the lining of the cement organs of the larva.\r\nPosteriorily there is evidence that the extension backwards of the\r\nseries of gill clefts was much greater in the primitive fishes. In the\r\nsurviving sharks (_Chlamydoselachus_ and _Notidanus cinereus_), there\r\nstill exist in the adult respectively six and seven branchial clefts,\r\nwhile in embryonic Selachians there are frequently to be seen pouch-like\r\noutgrowths of entoderm apparently representing rudimentary gill pouches\r\nbut which never develop. Further evidence of the progressive reduction\r\nin the series of clefts is seen in the reduction of their functional\r\nactivity at the two ends of the series. The spiracle, even where\r\npersisting in the adult, has lost its gill lamellae either entirely or\r\nexcepting a few vestigial lamellae forming a \"pseudobranch\" on its\r\nanterior wall (Selachians, sturgeons). A similar reduction affects the\r\nlamellae on the anterior wall of the hyobranchial cleft (except in\r\nSelachians) and on the posterior wall of the last branchial cleft.\r\n\r\n  A pseudobranch is frequently present in Teleostomes on the anterior\r\n  wall of the hyobranchial cleft, i.e. on the inner or posterior face of\r\n  the operculum. It is believed by some morphologists to belong really\r\n  to the cleft in front.[14]\r\n\r\n  _Phylogeny._--The phylogeny of the gill clefts or pouches is\r\n  uncertain. The only organs of vertebrates comparable with them\r\n  morphologically are the enterocoelic pouches of the entoderm which\r\n  give rise to the mesoderm. It is possible that the respiratory\r\n  significance of the wall of the gill cleft has been secondarily\r\n  acquired. This is indicated by the fact that they appear in some cases\r\n  to be lined by an ingrowth of ectoderm. This suggests that there may\r\n  have been a spreading inwards of respiratory surface from the external\r\n  gills. It is conceivable that before their walls became directly\r\n  respiratory the gill clefts served for the pumping of fresh water over\r\n  the external gills at the bases of which they lie.\r\n\r\n_Lung._--As in the higher vertebrates, there develops in all the main\r\ngroups of gnathostomatous fishes, except the Selachians, an outgrowth of\r\nthe pharyngeal wall intimately associated with gaseous interchange. In\r\nthe Crossopterygians and Dipnoans this pharyngeal outgrowth agrees\r\nexactly in its mid-ventral origin and in its blood-supply with the lungs\r\nof the higher vertebrates, and there can be no question about its being\r\nmorphologically the same structure as it is also in function.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--Lung of _Neoceratodus_, opened in its lower half\r\nto show its cellular pouches. a, Right half; b, Left half; c, Cellular\r\npouches; e, Pulmonary vein; f, Arterial blood-vessel; oe, Oesophagus,\r\nopened to show glottis (gl.)]\r\n\r\n  In the Crossopterygian the ventrally placed slit-like glottis leads\r\n  into a common chamber produced anteriorly into two horns and continued\r\n  backwards into two \"lungs.\" These are smooth, thin-walled, saccular\r\n  structures, the right one small, the left very large and extending to\r\n  the hind end of the splanchnocoele. In the Dipnoans the lung has taken\r\n  a dorsal position close under the vertebral column and above the\r\n  splanchnocoele. Its walls are sacculated, almost spongy in\r\n  _Lepidosiren_ and _Protopterus_, so as to give increase to the\r\n  respiratory surface. In _Nexeratodus_ (fig. 9) an indication of\r\n  division into two halves is seen in the presence of two prominent\r\n  longitudinal ridges, one dorsal and one ventral. In _Lepidosiren_ and\r\n  _Protopterus_ the organ is completely divided except at its anterior\r\n  end into a right and a left lung. The anterior portion of the lung or\r\n  lungs is connected with the median ventral glottis by a short wide\r\n  vestibule which lies on the right side of the oesophagus.\r\n\r\nIn the Teleostei the representative of the lung, here termed the\r\nswimbladder, has for its predominant function a hydrostatic one; it acts\r\nas a float. It arises as a diverticulum of the gut-wall which may retain\r\na tubular connexion with the gut (_physostomatous_ condition) or may in\r\nthe adult completely lose such connexion (_physoclistic_). It shows two\r\nconspicuous differences from the lung of other forms: (1) it arises in\r\nthe young fish as a dorsal instead of as a ventral diverticulum, and (2)\r\nit derives its blood-supply not from the sixth aortic arch but from\r\nbranches of the dorsal aorta.\r\n\r\n  These differences are held by many to be sufficient to invalidate the\r\n  homologizing of the swimbladder with the lung. The following facts,\r\n  however, appear to do away with the force of such a contention. (1) In\r\n  the Dipneusti (e.g. _Neoceratodus_) the lung apparatus has acquired a\r\n  dorsal position, but its connexion with the mid-ventral glottis is\r\n  asymmetrical, passing round the right side of the gut. Were the\r\n  predominant function of the lung in such a form to become hydrostatic\r\n  we might expect the course of evolution to lead to a shifting of the\r\n  glottis dorsalwards so as to bring it nearer to the definitive\r\n  situation of the lung. (2) In _Erythrinus_ and other Characinids the\r\n  glottis is not mid-ventral but decidedly lateral in position,\r\n  suggesting either a retention of, or a return to, ancestral stages in\r\n  the dorsalward migration of the glottis. (3) The blood-supply of the\r\n  Teleostean swimbladder is from branches of the dorsal aorta, which may\r\n  be distributed over a long anteroposterior extent of that vessel.\r\n  Embryology, however, shows that the swimbladder arises as a localized\r\n  diverticulum. It follows that the blood-supply from a long stretch of\r\n  the aorta can hardly be primitive. We should rather expect the\r\n  primitive blood-supply to be from the main arteries of the pharyngeal\r\n  wall, i.e. from the hinder aortic arch as is the case with the lungs\r\n  of other forms. Now in _Amia_ at least we actually find such a\r\n  blood-supply, there being here a pulmonary artery corresponding with\r\n  that in lung-possessing forms. Taking these points into consideration\r\n  there seems no valid reason for doubting that in lung and swimbladder\r\n  we are dealing with the same morphological structure.\r\n\r\n_Function._--In the Crossopterygians and Dipnoans the lung is used for\r\nrespiration, while at the same time fulfilling a hydrostatic function.\r\nAmongst the Actinopterygians a few forms still use it for respiration,\r\nbut its main function is that of a float. In connexion with this\r\nfunction there exists an interesting compensatory mechanism whereby the\r\namount of gas in the swimbladder may be diminished (by absorption), or,\r\non the other hand, increased, so as to counteract alterations in\r\nspecific gravity produced, e.g. by change of pressure with change of\r\ndepth. This mechanism is specially developed in physoclistic forms,\r\nwhere there occur certain glandular patches (\"red glands\") in the lining\r\nepithelium of the swimbladder richly stuffed with capillary\r\nblood-vessels and serving apparently to secrete gas into the\r\nswimbladder. That the gas in the swimbladder is produced by some vital\r\nprocess, such as secretion, is already indicated by its composition, as\r\nit may contain nearly 90% of oxygen in deep-sea forms or a similar\r\nproportion of nitrogen in fishes from deep lakes, i.e. its composition\r\nis quite different from what it would be were it accumulated within the\r\nswimbladder by mere ordinary diffusion processes. Further, the formation\r\nof gas is shown by experiment to be controlled by branches of the vagus\r\nand sympathetic nerves in an exactly similar fashion to the secretion of\r\nsaliva in a salivary gland. (See below for relations of swimbladder to\r\near).\r\n\r\nOf the important non-respiratory derivatives of the pharyngeal wall\r\n(thyroid, thymus, postbranchial bodies, &c.), only the thyroid calls for\r\nspecial mention, as important clues to its evolutionary history are\r\nafforded by the lampreys. In the larval lamprey the thyroid develops as\r\na longitudinal groove on the pharyngeal floor. From the anterior end of\r\nthis groove there pass a pair of peripharyngeal ciliated tracts to the\r\ndorsal side of the pharynx where they pass backwards to the hind end of\r\nthe pharynx. Morphologically the whole apparatus corresponds closely\r\nwith the endostyle and peripharyngeal and dorsal ciliated tracts of the\r\npharynx of _Amphioxus_. The correspondence extends to function, as the\r\nopen thyroid groove secretes a sticky mucus which passes into the\r\npharyngeal cavity for the entanglement of food particles exactly as in\r\n_Amphioxus_. Later on the thyroid groove becomes shut off from the\r\npharynx; its secretion now accumulates in the lumina of its interior and\r\nit functions as a ductless gland as in the Gnathostomata. The only\r\nconceivable explanation of this developmental history of the thyroid in\r\nthe lamprey is that it is a repetition of phylogenetic history.\r\n\r\nBehind the pharynx comes the main portion of the alimentary canal\r\nconcerned with the digestion and absorption of the food. This forms a\r\ntube varying greatly in length, more elongated and coiled in the higher\r\nTeleostomes, shorter and straighter in the Selachians, Dipnoans and\r\nlower Teleostomes. The oesophagus or gullet, usually forming a short,\r\nwide tube, leads into the glandular, more or less dilated stomach. This\r\nis frequently in the form of a letter J, the longer limb being\r\ncontinuous with the gullet, the shorter with the intestine. The curve of\r\nthe J may be as in _Polypterus_ and the perch produced backwards into a\r\nlarge pocket. The intestine is usually marked off from the stomach by a\r\nring-like sphincter muscle forming the pyloric valve. In the lower\r\ngnathostomatous fishes (Selachians, Crossopterygians, Dipnoans,\r\nsturgeons) the intestine possesses the highly characteristic spiral\r\nvalve, a shelf-like projection into its lumen which pursues a spiral\r\ncourse, and along the turns of which the food passes during the course\r\nof digestion. From its universal occurrence in the groups mentioned we\r\nconclude that it is a structure of a very archaic type, once\r\ncharacteristic of ancestral Gnathostomata; a hint as to its\r\nmorphological significance is given by its method of development.[15] In\r\nan early stage of development the intestinal rudiment is coiled into a\r\nspiral and it is by the fusion together of the turns that the spiral\r\nvalve arises. The only feasible explanation of this peculiar method of\r\ndevelopment seems to lie in the assumption that the ancestral\r\ngnathostome possessed an elongated, coiled intestine which subsequently\r\nbecame shortened with a fusion of its coils. In the higher fishes the\r\nspiral valve has disappeared--being still found, however, in a reduced\r\ncondition in _Amia_ and _Lepidosteus_, and possibly as a faint vestige\r\nin one or two Teleosts (certain _Clupeidae_[16] and _Salmonidae_[17]).\r\nIn the majority of the Teleosts the absence of spiral valves is coupled\r\nwith a secondary elongation of the intestinal region, which in extreme\r\ncases (_Loricariidae_) may be accompanied by a secondary spiral coiling.\r\n\r\nThe terminal part of the alimentary canal--the cloaca--is characterized\r\nby the fact that into it open the two kidney ducts. In Teleostomes the\r\ncloaca is commonly flattened out, so that the kidney ducts and the\r\nalimentary canal come to open independently on the outer surface.\r\n\r\nThe lining of the alimentary canal is throughout the greater part of its\r\nextent richly glandular. And at certain points local enlargements of the\r\nsecretory surface take place so as to form glandular diverticula. The\r\nmost ancient of these as indicated by its occurrence even in _Amphioxus_\r\nappears to be the _liver_, which, originally--as we may assume--mainly a\r\ndigestive gland, has in the existing Craniates developed important\r\nexcretory and glycogen-storing functions. Arising in the embryo as a\r\nsimple caecum, the liver becomes in the adult a compact gland of very\r\nlarge size, usually bi-lobed in shape and lying in the front portion of\r\nthe splanchnocoele. The stalk of the liver rudiment becomes drawn out\r\ninto a tubular bile duct, which may become subdivided into branches, and\r\nas a rule develops on its course a pocket-like expansion, the\r\ngall-bladder. This may hang freely in the splanchnocoele or may be, as\r\nin many Selachians, imbedded in the liver substance.\r\n\r\nThe pancreas also arises by localized bulging outwards of the intestinal\r\nlining--there being commonly three distinct rudiments in the embryo. In\r\nthe Selachians the whitish compact pancreas of the adult opens into the\r\nintestine some little distance behind the opening of the bile duct, but\r\nin the Teleostomes it becomes involved in the liver outgrowth and mixed\r\nwith its tissue, being frequently recognizable only by the study of\r\nmicroscopic sections. In the Dipnoans the pancreatic rudiment remains\r\nimbedded in the wall of the intestine: its duct is united with that of\r\nthe liver.\r\n\r\n_Pyloric Caeca._--In the Teleostomi one or more glandular diverticula\r\ncommonly occur at the commencement of the intestine and are known as the\r\npyloric caeca. There may be a single caecum (crossopterygians,\r\n_Ammodytes_ amongst Teleosts) or there may be nearly two hundred\r\n(mackerel). In the sturgeons the numerous caeca form a compact gland. In\r\nseveral families of Teleosts, on the other hand, there is no trace of\r\nthese pyloric caeca.\r\n\r\nIn Selachians a small glandular diverticulum known as the _rectal gland_\r\nopens into the terminal part of the intestine on its dorsal side.\r\n\r\n_Coelomic Organs._--The development of the mesoderm in the restricted\r\nsense (mesothelium) as seen in the fishes (lamprey, _Lepidosiren_,\r\n_Protopterus_, _Polypterus_) appears to indicate beyond doubt that the\r\nmesoderm segments of vertebrates are really enterocoelic pouches in\r\nwhich the development of the lumen is delayed. Either the inner, or both\r\ninner and outer (e.g. _Lepidosiren_) walls of the mesoderm segment pass\r\nthrough a myoepithelial condition and give rise eventually to the great\r\nmuscle segments (myomeres, or myotomes) which lie in series on each side\r\nof the trunk. In the fishes these remain distinct throughout life. The\r\nfins, both median and paired, obtain their musculature by the ingrowth\r\ninto them of muscle buds from the adjoining myotomes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From Gegenbaur, _Untersuchungen zur vergleich.

In\r\ncertain fishes definite tracts of the musculature show a reduction of\r\ntheir previously predominant function of contraction and an increase of\r\ntheir previously subsidiary function of producing electrical\r\ndisturbance; so that the latter function is now predominant.\r\n\r\n  In the skates (_Raia_) the electrical organ is a fusiform structure\r\n  derived from the lateral musculature of the tail; in _Gymnotus_--the\r\n  electric eel--and in _Mormyrus_ it forms an enormous structure\r\n  occupying the place of the ventral halves of the myotomes along nearly\r\n  the whole length of the body; in _Torpedo_ it forms a large, somewhat\r\n  kidney-shaped structure as viewed from above lying on each side of the\r\n  head and derived from the musculature of the anterior visceral arches.\r\n  In _Torpedo_ the nerve-supply is derived from cranial nerves VII. IX.\r\n  and the anterior branchial branches of X.\r\n\r\nThe electric organ is composed of prismatic columns each built up of a\r\nrow of compartments. Each compartment contains a lamellated electric\r\ndisc representing the shortened-up and otherwise metamorphosed muscle\r\nfibre. On one face (ventral in _Torpedo_, anterior in _Raia_) of the\r\nelectric disc is a gigantic end-plate supplied by a beautiful,\r\ndichotomously branched, terminal nervous arborization.\r\n\r\nThe development of the mesoderm of the head region is too obscure for\r\ntreatment here.[19] The ventral portion of the trunk mesoderm gives rise\r\nto the splanchnocoel or general coelom. Except in the Myxinoids the\r\nanterior part of the splanchnocoel becomes separated off as a\r\npericardiac cavity, though in adult Selachians the separation becomes\r\nincomplete, the two cavities being in communication by a\r\npericardio-peritoneal canal.\r\n\r\n_Nephridial System._---The kidney system in fishes consists of\r\nsegmentally arranged tubes leading from the coelom into a longitudinal\r\nduct which opens within the hinder end of the enteron--the whole forming\r\nwhat is known as the _archinephros_ (Lankester) or _holonephros_\r\n(Price). Like the other segmented organs of the vertebrate the\r\narchinephros develops from before backwards. The sequence is, however,\r\nnot regular. A small number of tubules at the head end of the series\r\nbecome specially enlarged and are able to meet the excretory needs\r\nduring larval existence (_Pronephros_): the immediately succeeding\r\ntubules remain undeveloped, and then come the tubules of the rest of the\r\nseries which form the functional kidney of the adult (_Mesonephros_).\r\n\r\nThe kidney tubules subserve the excretory function in two different\r\nways. The wall of the tubule, bathed in blood from the posterior\r\ncardinal vein, serves to extract nitrogenous products of excretion from\r\nthe blood and pass them into the lumen of the tubule. The open ciliated\r\nfunnel or nephrostome at the coelomic end of the tubule serves for the\r\npassage outwards of coelomic fluid to flush the cavity of the tubule.\r\nThe secretory activity of the coelomic lining is specially concentrated\r\nin certain limited areas in the neighbourhood of the nephrostomes, each\r\nsuch area ensheathing a rounded mass depending into the coelom and\r\nformed of a blood-vessel coiled into a kind of skein--a glomerulus. In\r\nthe case of the pronephros the glomeruli are as a rule fused together\r\ninto a single glomus. In the mesonephros they remain separate and in\r\nthis case the portion of coelom surrounding the glomerulus tends to be\r\nnipped off from the general coelom--to form a Malpighian body. The\r\nseparation may be incomplete--the Malpighian coelom remaining in\r\nconnexion with the general coelom by a narrow peritoneal canal. The\r\nsplanchnocoelic end of this is usually ciliated and is termed a\r\nperitoneal funnel: it is frequently confused with the nephrostome.\r\n\r\n_Mesonephros._--The kidney of the adult fish is usually a compact gland\r\nextending over a considerable distance in an anteroposterior direction\r\nand lying immediately dorsal to the coelomic cavity.\r\n\r\nPeritoneal funnels are present in the adult of certain Selachians (e.g.\r\n_Acanthias_, _Squatina_), though apparently in at least some of these\r\nforms they no longer communicate with the Malpighian bodies or tubules.\r\nThe kidneys of the two sides become fused together posteriorly in\r\n_Protopterus_ and in some Teleosts. The mesonephric ducts undergo fusion\r\nposteriorly in many cases to form a median urinary or urinogenital\r\nsinus. In the Selachians this median sinus is prolonged forwards into a\r\npair of horn-like continuations--the sperm sacs. In Dipnoans the sinus\r\nbecomes greatly dilated and forms a large, rounded, dorsally placed\r\ncloacal caecum. In Actinopterygians a urinary bladder of similar\r\nmorphological import is commonly present.\r\n\r\n_Gonads._--The portion of coelomic lining which gives rise to the\r\nreproductive cells retains its primitive relations most nearly in the\r\nfemale, where, as a rule, the genital cells are still shed into the\r\nsplanchnocoele. Only in Teleostomes (_Lepidosteus_ and most Teleosts)\r\nthe modification occurs that the ovary is shut off from the\r\nsplanchnocoele as a closed cavity continuous with its duct.\r\n\r\n  In a few Teleosts (_Salmonidae_, _Muraenidae_, _Cobitis_) the ovary is\r\n  not a closed sac, its eggs being shed into the coelom as in other\r\n  groups.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the ovary naturally varies greatly with the character\r\nof the eggs.\r\n\r\nThe portion of coelomic lining which gives rise to the male genital\r\ncells (testis) is in nearly, if not quite, all cases, shut off from the\r\nsplanchnocoele. The testes are commonly elongated in form. In\r\nDipneusti[20] (_Lepidosiren_ and _Protopterus_) the hinder portion of\r\nthe elongated testis has lost its sperm-producing function, though the\r\nspermatozoa produced in the anterior portion have to traverse it in\r\norder to reach the kidney. In _Polypterus_[21] the testis is continued\r\nbackwards as a \"testis ridge,\" which appears to correspond with the\r\nposterior vesicular region of the testis in _Lepidosiren_ and\r\n_Protopterus_. Here also the spermatozoa pass back through the cavities\r\nof the testis ridge to reach the kidney duct. In the young Teleost[22]\r\nthe rudiment of the duct forms a backward continuation of the testis\r\ncontaining a network of cavities and opening as a rule posteriorly into\r\nthe kidney duct. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the testis\r\nduct of the Teleost is for the most part the equivalent morphologically\r\nof the posterior vesicular region of the testis of _Polypterus_ and the\r\nDipneusti.\r\n\r\n_Relations of Renal and Reproductive Organs._ (1) _Female._--In the\r\nSelachians and Dipnoans the oviduct is of the type (Müllerian duct)\r\npresent in the higher vertebrates and apparently representing a\r\nsplit-off portion of the archinephric duct. At its anterior end is a\r\nwide funnel-like coelomic opening. Its walls are glandular and secrete\r\naccessory coverings for the eggs. In the great majority of Teleosts and\r\nin _Lepidosteus_ the oviduct possesses no coelomic funnel, its walls\r\nbeing in structural continuity with the wall of the ovary. In most of\r\nthe more primitive Teleostomes (Crossopterygians, sturgeons, _Amia_) the\r\noviduct has at its front end an open coelomic funnel, and it is\r\ndifficult to find adequate reason for refusing to regard such oviducts\r\nas true Müllerian ducts. On this interpretation the condition\r\ncharacteristic of Teleosts would be due to the lips of the oviduct\r\nbecoming fused with the ovarian wall, and the duct itself would be a\r\nMüllerian duct as elsewhere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From _Arch. zool, expérimentale_, by permission of\r\nSchleicher Frères.\r\n\r\nFIG. 11.--Urino-Genital Organs of the right side in a male _Scyllium_.\r\n(After Borcea.)\r\n\r\n  m.n. 1, Anterior (genital) portion of mesonephros\r\n  with its coiled duct.\r\n  m.n. 2, Posterior (renal) portion of mesonephros.\r\n  s.s, Sperm sac.\r\n  T, Testis.\r\n  u, \"Ureter\" formed by fusion of collecting tubes of renal portion of\r\n    mesonephros.\r\n  u.g.s, Urino-genital sinus;\r\n  v.s, Vesicula seminalis.]\r\n\r\n  A departure from the normal arrangement is found in those Teleosts\r\n  which shed their eggs into the splanchnocoele, e.g. amongst\r\n  _Salmonidae_, the smelt (_Osmerus_) and capelin (_Mallotus_) possess a\r\n  pair of oviducts resembling Müllerian ducts while the salmon possesses\r\n  merely a pair of genital pores opening together behind the anus. It\r\n  seems most probable that the latter condition has been derived from\r\n  the former by reduction of the Müllerian ducts, though it has been\r\n  argued that the converse process has taken place. The genital pores\r\n  mentioned must not be confused with the _abdominal pores_, which in\r\n  many adult fishes, particularly in those without open peritoneal\r\n  funnels, lead from coelom directly to the exterior in the region of\r\n  the cloacal opening. These appear to be recent developments, and to\r\n  have nothing to do morphologically with the genitourinary system.[23]\r\n\r\n(2) _Male._--It seems that primitively the male reproductive elements\r\nlike the female were shed into the coelom and passed thence through the\r\nnephridial tubules. In correlation probably with the greatly reduced\r\nsize of these elements they are commonly no longer shed into the\r\nsplanchnocoele, but are conveyed from the testis through covered-in\r\ncanals to the Malpighian bodies or kidney tubules. The system of\r\ncovered-in canals forms the testicular network, the individual canals\r\nbeing termed vasa efferentia. In all probability the series of vasa\r\nefferentia was originally spread over the whole length of the elongated\r\ntestis (cf. _Lepidosteus_), but in existing fishes the series is as a\r\nrule restricted to a comparatively short anteroposterior extent. In\r\nSelachians the vasa efferentia are restricted to the anterior end of\r\ntestis and kidney, and are connected by a longitudinal canal ending\r\nblindly in front and behind. The number of vasa efferentia varies and in\r\nthe rays (_Raia_, _Torpedo_) may be reduced to a single one opening\r\ndirectly into the front end of the mesonephric duct. The anterior\r\nportion of the mesonephros is much reduced in size in correlation with\r\nthe fact that it has lost its renal function. The hinder part, which is\r\nthe functional kidney, is considerably enlarged. The primary tubules of\r\nthis region of the kidney have undergone a modification of high\r\nmorphological interest. Their distal portions have become much\r\nelongated, they are more or less fused, and their openings into the\r\nmesonephric duct have undergone backward migration until they open\r\ntogether either into the mesonephric duct at its posterior end or into\r\nthe urinogenital sinus independently of the mesonephric duct. The\r\nmesonephric duct is now connected only with the anterior part of the\r\nkidney, and serves merely as a vas deferens or sperm duct. In\r\ncorrelation with this it is somewhat enlarged, especially in its\r\nposterior portion, to form a vesicula seminalis.\r\n\r\n  The morphological interest of these features lies in the fact that\r\n  they represent a stage in evolution which carried a little farther\r\n  would lead to a complete separation of the definitive kidney\r\n  (_metanephros_) from the purely genital anterior section of the\r\n  mesonephros (_epididymis_), as occurs so characteristically in the\r\n  Amniota.\r\n\r\nDipneusti.--In _Lepidosiren_[24] a small number (about half a dozen) of\r\nvasa efferentia occur towards the hind end of the vesicular part of the\r\ntestis and open into Malpighian bodies. In _Protopterus_ the vasa\r\nefferentia are reduced to a single one on each side at the extreme hind\r\nend of the testis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Graham Kerr, _Proc. Zool. Soc.

(In the case of\r\n_Amia_ they open into the tubules or even directly into the mesonephric\r\nduct.) In the Teleosts and in _Polypterus_ there is no obvious connexion\r\nbetween testis and kidney, the wall of the testis being continuous with\r\nthat of its duct, much as is the case with the ovary and its duct in the\r\nfemale. In all probability this peculiar condition is to be\r\nexplained[26] by the reduction of the testicular network to a single vas\r\nefferens (much as in _Protopterus_ or as in _Raia_ and various anurous\r\nAmphibians at the front end of the series) which has come to open\r\ndirectly into the mesonephric duct (cf. fig. 12).\r\n\r\n_Organs of the Mesenchyme._--In vertebrates as in all other Metazoa,\r\nexcept the very lowest, there are numerous cell elements which no longer\r\nform part of the regularly arranged epithelial layers, but which take\r\npart in the formation of the packing tissue of the body. Much of this\r\nforms the various kinds of connective tissue which fill up many of the\r\nspaces between the various epithelial layers; other and very important\r\nparts of the general mesenchyme become specialized in two definite\r\ndirections and give rise to two special systems of organs. One of these\r\nis characterized by the fact that the intercellular substance or matrix\r\nassumes a more or less rigid character--it may be infiltrated with salts\r\nof lime--giving rise to the supporting tissues of the skeletal system.\r\nThe other is characterized by the intercellular matrix becoming fluid,\r\nand by the cell elements losing their connexion with one another and\r\nforming the characteristic fluid tissue, the blood, which with its\r\nwell-marked containing walls forms the blood vascular system.\r\n\r\n_Skeletal System._--The skeletal system may be considered under three\r\nheadings--(1) the chordal skeleton, (2) the cartilaginous skeleton and\r\n(3) the osseous skeleton.\r\n\r\n1. _Chordal Skeleton._--The most ancient element of the skeleton appears\r\nto be the _notochord_--a cylindrical rod composed of highly vacuolated\r\ncells lying ventral to the central nervous system and dorsal to the gut.\r\nExcept in _Amphioxus_--where the condition may probably be secondary,\r\ndue to degenerative shortening of the central nervous system--the\r\nnotochord extends from a point just behind the infundibulum of the brain\r\n(see below) to nearly the tip of the tail. In ontogeny the notochord is\r\na derivative of the dorsal wall of the archenteron. The outer layer of\r\ncells, which are commonly less vacuolated and form a \"chordal\r\nepithelium,\" soon secretes a thin cuticle which ensheaths the notochord\r\nand is known as the primary sheath. Within this there is formed later a\r\nsecondary sheath, like the primary, cuticular in nature. This secondary\r\nsheath attains a considerable thickness and plays an important part in\r\nstrengthening the notochord. The notochord with its sheaths is in\r\nexisting fishes essentially the skeleton of early life (embryonic or\r\nlarval). In the adult it may, in the more primitive forms (Cyclostomata,\r\nDipneusti), persist as an important part of the skeleton, but as a rule\r\nit merely forms the foundation on which the cartilaginous or bony\r\nvertebral column is laid down.\r\n\r\n2. _Cartilaginous or Chondral Skeleton._--(A) Vertebral column.[27] In\r\nthe embryonic connective tissue or mesenchyme lying just outside the\r\nprimary sheath of the notochord there are developed a dorsal and a\r\nventral series of paired nodules of cartilage known as _arcualia_ (fig.\r\n13, d.a, v.a). The dorsal arcualia are commonly prolonged upwards by\r\nsupradorsal cartilages which complete the _neural arches_ and serve to\r\nprotect the spinal cord. The ventral arcualia become, in the tail region\r\nonly, also incorporated in complete arches--the _haemal arches_. In\r\ncorrelation with the flattening of the body of the fish from side to\r\nside the arches are commonly prolonged into elongated neural or haemal\r\nspines.\r\n\r\n  The relations of the arcualia to the segmentation of the body, as\r\n  shown by myotomes and spinal nerves, is somewhat obscure. The\r\n  mesenchyme in which they arise is segmental in origin (sclerotom),\r\n  which suggests that they too may have been primitively segmental, but\r\n  in existing fishes there are commonly two sets of arcualia to each\r\n  body segment.\r\n\r\nIn gnathostomatous fishes the arcualia play a most important part in\r\nthat cartilaginous tissue derived from them comes into special\r\nrelationships with the notochord and gives rise to the vertebral column\r\nwhich functionally replaces this notochord in most of the fishes. This\r\nreplacement occurs according to two different methods, giving rise to\r\nthe different types of vertebral column known as chordacentrous and\r\narcicentrous.\r\n\r\n(a) Chordacentrous type. An incipient stage in the evolution of a\r\nchordacentrous vertebral column occurs in the Dipneusti, where cartilage\r\ncells from the arcualia become amoeboid and migrate into the substance\r\nof the secondary sheath, boring their way through the primary sheath\r\n(fig. 13, C). They wander throughout the whole extent of the secondary\r\nsheath, colonizing it as it were, and settle down as typical stationary\r\ncartilage cells. The secondary sheath is thus converted into a cylinder\r\nof cartilage. In Selachians exactly the same thing takes place, but in\r\nrecent forms development goes a step further, as the cartilage cylinder\r\nbecomes broken into a series of segments, known as vertebral centra. The\r\nwall of each segment becomes much thickened in the middle so that the\r\nnotochord becomes constricted within each centrum and the space occupied\r\nby it is shaped like the cavity of a dice-box. When free from notochord\r\nand surrounding tissues such a cartilaginous centrum presents a deep\r\nconical cavity at each end (_amphicoelous_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From Wiedersheim, _Grundriss der vergleichenden\r\nAnatomie_, by permission of Gustav Fischer.\r\n\r\nFIG. 13.--Diagrammatic transverse sections to illustrate the morphology\r\nof the vertebral column.\r\n\r\n  A, Primitive conditions as seen in any young embryo.\r\n  B, Condition as it occurs in Cyclostomata, sturgeons, embryos of bony\r\n    Actinopterygians.\r\n  C, Condition found in Selachians and Dipnoans.\r\n  D and E, Illustrating the developmental process in bony\r\n    Actinopterygians and higher vertebrates.\r\n  c,     Centrum.\r\n  d.a,   Dorsal arcualia.\r\n  n.a,   Neural arch.\r\n  nc,    Notochord.\r\n  nc.ep, Chordal epithelium.\r\n  n.sp,  Neural spine.\r\n  sh.1,  Primary sheath.\r\n  sh.2,  Secondary sheath.\r\n  sk.l,  Connective tissue.\r\n  tr.p,  Transverse process.\r\n  v.a,   Ventral arcualia.]\r\n\r\n  A secondary modification of the centrum consists in the calcification\r\n  of certain zones of the cartilaginous matrix. The precise arrangement\r\n  of these calcified zones varies in different families and affords\r\n  characters which are of taxonomic importance in palaeontology where\r\n  only skeletal structures are available (see SELACHIANS).\r\n\r\n(b) Arcicentrous type. Already in the Selachians the vertebral column is\r\nto a certain extent strengthened by the broadening of the basis of the\r\narcualia so as partially to surround the centra. In the Teleostomes,\r\nwith the exceptions of those ganoids mentioned, the expanded bases of\r\nthe arcualia undergo complete fusion to form cartilaginous centra which,\r\nunlike the chordacentrous centra, lie outside the primary sheath (figs.\r\n13, D and E). In these forms no invasion of the secondary sheath by\r\ncartilage cells takes place. The composition of the groups of arcualia\r\nwhich give rise to the individual centrum is different in different\r\ngroups. The end result is an amphicoelous or biconcave centrum in\r\ngeneral appearance much like that of the Selachian.\r\n\r\n  In _Lepidosteus_ the spaces between adjacent centra become filled by a\r\n  secondary development of intervertebral cartilage which then splits in\r\n  such a way that the definitive vertebrae are _opisthocoelous_, i.e.\r\n  concave behind, convex in front.\r\n\r\n_Ribs._--In the Crossopterygians a double set of \"ribs\" is present on\r\neach side of the vertebral column, a ventral set lying immediately\r\noutside the splanchnocoelic lining and apparently serially homologous\r\nwith the haemal arches of the caudal region, and a second set passing\r\noutwards in the thickness of the body wall at a more dorsal level. In\r\nthe Teleostomes and Dipnoans only the first type is present; in the\r\nSelachians only the second. It would appear that it is the latter which\r\nis homologous with the ribs of vertebrates above fishes.\r\n\r\n_Median Fin Skeleton._--the foundation of the skeleton of the median\r\nfins consists of a series of rod-like elements, the radialia, each of\r\nwhich frequently is segmented into three portions. In a few cases the\r\nradialia correspond segmentally with the neural and haemal arches\r\n(living Dipnoans, _Pleuracanthus_ tail region) and this suggests that\r\nthey represent morphologically prolongations of the neural and haemal\r\nspines. That this is so is rendered probable by the fact that we must\r\nregard the evolution of the system of median fins as commencing with a\r\nsimple flattening of the posterior part of the body. It is only natural\r\nto suppose that the edges of the flattened region would be at first\r\nsupported merely by prolongations of the already existing spinous\r\nprocesses. In the Cyclostomes (where they are branched) and in the\r\nSelachians, the radialia form the main supports of the fin, though\r\nalready in the latter they are reinforced by a new set of fin rays\r\napparently related morphologically to the osseous or placoid skeleton\r\n(see below).\r\n\r\n  The series of radialia tends to undergo the same process of local\r\n  concentration which characterizes the fin-fold as a whole. In its\r\n  extreme form this leads to complete fusion of the basal portions of a\r\n  number of radialia (dorsal fins of _Holoptychius_ and various\r\n  Selachians, and anal fin of _Pleuracanthus_). In view of the identity\r\n  in function it is not surprising that a remarkable resemblance exists\r\n  between the mechanical arrangements (of skeleton, muscles, &c.), of\r\n  the paired and unpaired fins. The resemblance to paired fins becomes\r\n  very striking in some of the cases where the basal fusion mentioned\r\n  above takes place (_Pleuracanthus_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Trans. Roy. Soc.

This\r\nconsists of a praechordal portion--developed out of a pair of lateral\r\ncartilaginous rods--the _trabeculae cranii_--and a parachordal portion\r\nlying on either side of the anterior end of the notochord. This arises\r\nin development from a cartilaginous rod (parachordal cartilage) lying\r\non each side of the notochord and possibly representing a fused row of\r\ndorsal arcualia. The originally separate parachordals and trabeculae\r\nbecome connected to form a trough-like, primitive cranium, complete or\r\nnearly so laterally and ventrally but open dorsally. With the primitive\r\ncranium there are also connected cartilaginous capsules developed round\r\nthe olfactory and auditory organs. There also become fused with the\r\nhinder end of the cranium a varying number of originally distinct neural\r\narches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _A._ After W. K. Parker, _Trans. Zool. Soc.

The skeleton of arches I. and II. (mandibular and\r\nhyoidean) undergoes modifications of special interest (figs. 14 and 15).\r\nThe lower portion of the mandibular arch becomes greatly thickened to\r\nsupport the lower or hinder edge of the mouth. It forms the primitive\r\nlower jaw or \"Meckel's cartilage.\" Dorsal to this an outgrowth arises from\r\nthe anterior face of the arch which supports the upper or anterior margin\r\nof the mouth: it is the primitive upper jaw or palato-pterygoquadrate\r\ncartilage. The portion of the arch dorsal to the palato-pterygo-quadrate\r\noutgrowth may form the suspensorial apparatus of the lower jaw, being\r\nfused with the cranium at its upper end. This relatively primitive\r\ncon-arrangement (_protostylic_, as it may be termed) occurs in Dipneusti\r\namong fishes (cf. fig. 14). More usually this dorsal part of the\r\nmandibular arch becomes reduced, its place being occupied by a ligament\r\n(pre-spiracular) uniting the jaw apparatus to the chondrocranium, the\r\nupper jaw being also attached to the chondrocranium by the ethmopalatine\r\nligament situated more anteriorly. The main attachment, however, of the\r\njaws to the chondrocranium in such a case, as holds for the majority of\r\nfishes, is through the enlarged dorsal segment of the hyoid arch\r\n(hyomandibular) which articulates at its dorsal end with the\r\nchondrocranium, while its ventral end is attached to the hinge region of\r\nthe jaw by stout ligamentous bands. A skull in which the jaws are\r\nsuspended in this manner is termed a hyostylic skull (e.g. _Scyllium_ in\r\nfig. 15).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.--Fore-limb of _Ceratodus_.]\r\n\r\n  In _Notidanus_ (fig. 15, B) there is a large direct articulation of\r\n  the upper jaw to the chondrocranium in addition to the indirect one\r\n  through the hyomandibular: such a skull is amphistylic. In\r\n  _Heterodontus_ the upper jaw is firmly bound to the cranium throughout\r\n  its length, while in Holocephali (fig. 15, C) complete fusion has\r\n  taken place, so that the lower jaw appears to articulate directly with\r\n  the cranium (\"auto stylic\" condition). In Dipneusti[29] (_Lepidosiren_\r\n  and _Protopterus_) the cartilaginous upper jaw never develops (except\r\n  in its hinder quadrate portion) beyond the condition of a faint\r\n  rudiment, owing doubtless to its being replaced functionally by\r\n  precociously developed bone.\r\n\r\n(D) _Appendicular Skeleton._--The skeleton of the free part of the limb\r\nis attached to the limb girdle which lies embedded in the musculature of\r\nthe body. Each limb girdle is probably to be looked upon as consisting,\r\nlike the skeleton of the visceral arches, of a pair of lateral\r\nhalf-hoops of cartilage. While in _Pleuracanthus_ the lateral halves are\r\ndistinct (and segmented like the branchial arches), in living Selachians\r\ngenerally the two halves are completely fused ventrally with one\r\nanother. The part of the girdle lying dorsal to the articulation of the\r\nlimb is termed scapular in the case of the pectoral limb, iliac in the\r\ncase of the pelvic, while the ventral portions are known respectively as\r\ncoracoid and ischio-pubic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.--a, Skeleton of pectoral limb of\r\n_Pleuracanthus_. (From Gegenbauer, after Frisch.) b, Skeleton of\r\npectoral limb of _Acanthias_. (After Gegenbauer.)]\r\n\r\n  In most Teleostomes the primitive pelvic girdle does not develop; in\r\n  the Dipneusti it is represented by a median unpaired cartilage.\r\n\r\nThe skeleton of the free limb is probably seen in its most archaic form\r\namongst existing fishes in the biserial archipterygium of _Ceratodus_\r\n(fig. 16). This is indicated by the relative predominance of this type\r\nof fin amongst the geologically more ancient fishes. The biserial\r\narchipterygium consists of a segmented axial rod, bearing a praeaxial\r\nand a postaxial series of jointed rays.\r\n\r\n  In _Protopterus_ and _Lepidosiren_ the limbs are reduced and the\r\n  lateral rays have less (_Protopterus_) or more (_Lepidosiren_)\r\n  completely disappeared.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From Budgett, _Trans. Zool. Soc. London_, xvi, part vii.\r\nFrom Wiedersheim's _Verg. Anat. der Wirbeltiere_, by permission of\r\nGustav Fischer.\r\n\r\nFIG. 18.--Skeleton of Pectoral Limb of _Polypterus_. a, 30 mm. larva. b,\r\nAdult.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From Wiesdersheim's _Verg. Anat. der Wirbeltiere_, by\r\npermission of Gustav Fischer.\r\n\r\nFIG. 19.--Skeleton of Pectoral Fin of _Amia_.]\r\n\r\nIn such an archaic Selachian as _Pleuracanthus_ the fin is clearly of\r\nthe biserial archipterygial type, but the lateral rays are reduced\r\n(pectoral) or absent (pelvic) (fig. 17, a) on one side of the axis. In a\r\ntypical adult Selachian the pectoral fin skeleton has little apparent\r\nresemblance to the biserial archipterygium--the numerous outwardly\r\ndirected rays springing from a series of large basal cartilages (_pro_-,\r\n_meso_- and _metapterygium_). The condition in the young (e.g. fig. 17,\r\nb, _Acanthias_) hints strongly, however, at the possibility of the fin\r\nskeleton being really a modified biserial archipterygium, and that the\r\nbasal cartilages represent the greatly enlarged axis which has become\r\nfixed back along the side of the body. In Crossopterygians\r\n(_Polypterus_) the highly peculiar fin skeleton (fig. 18) while still in\r\nthe embryonic cartilaginous stage is clearly referable to a similar\r\ncondition. In the Actinopterygians--with the increased development of\r\ndermal fin rays--there comes about reduction of the primitive limb\r\nskeleton. The axis becomes particularly reduced, and the fin comes to be\r\nattached directly to the pectoral girdle by a number of basal pieces\r\n(Teleosts) probably representing vestigial rays (cf. fig. 19).\r\n\r\n  Views on the general morphology of the fin skeleton are strongly\r\n  affected by the view held as to the mode of evolution of the fins. By\r\n  upholders of the lateral fold hypothesis the type of fin skeleton\r\n  described for _Cladoselache_[30] is regarded as particularly\r\n  primitive. It is, however, by no means clear that the obscure basal\r\n  structures figured (Fig. 20) in this fin do not really represent the\r\n  pressed back axis as in _Pleuracanthus_.\r\n\r\nThe pelvic fin skeleton, while built obviously on the same plan as the\r\npectoral, is liable to much modification and frequently degeneration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From Bashford Dean, Mem. _N.Y. Acad. of Science_.\r\n\r\nFIG. 20.--Skeleton of Pectoral Fin of _Cladoselache_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.--Placoid elements of a male Thorn-back, _Raia\r\nclavata_.]\r\n\r\n_Osseous or Bony Skeleton._--The most ancient type of bony skeleton\r\nappears to be represented in the _placoid_ elements such as are seen in\r\nthe skin of the Selachian (fig. 21). Each placoid element consists of a\r\nspine with a broadly expanded base embedded in the dermis. The base is\r\ncomposed of bone: the spine of the somewhat modified bone known as\r\ndentine. Ensheathing the tip of the spine is a layer of extremely hard\r\nenamel formed by the inner surface of the ectoderm which originally\r\ncovered it. Such typical placoid scales are well seen on any ordinary\r\nskate. In the groups of fishes above the Selachians, the coating of\r\nplacoid elements shows various modifications. The spines disappear,\r\nthough they may be present for a time in early development. The bony\r\nbasal plates tend to undergo fusion--in certain cases they form a\r\ncontinuous bony cuirass (various Siluroids, trunk-fishes) formed of\r\nlarge plates jointed together at their edges. More usually the plates\r\nare small and regular in size. In Crossopterygians and _Lepidosteus_ and\r\nin many extinct forms the scales are of the ganoid type, being\r\nrhomboidal and having their outer layer composed of hard glistening\r\nganoine. In other Teleostomes the scales are as a rule thin, rounded and\r\noverlapping--the so-called cycloid type (fig. 22, A); where the\r\nposterior edge shows toothlike projections the scale is termed ctenoid\r\n(fig. 22, B). In various Teleosts the scales are vestigial (eel); in\r\nothers (as in most electric fishes) they have completely disappeared.\r\n\r\n_Teeth._--Certain of the placoid elements belonging to that part of the\r\nskin which gives rise to the lining of the stomodaeum have their spines\r\nenlarged or otherwise modified to form teeth. In the majority of fishes\r\nthese remain simple, conical structures: in some of the larger sharks\r\n(_Carcharodon_) they become flattened into trenchant blades with\r\nserrated edges: in certain rays (_Myliobatis_) they form a pavement of\r\nflattened plates suited for crushing molluscan shells. In the young\r\n_Neoceratodus_[31] there are numerous small conical teeth, the bases of\r\nwhich become connected by a kind of spongework of bony trabeculae. As\r\ndevelopment goes on a large basal mass is formed which becomes the\r\nfunctional tooth plate of the adult, the original separate denticles\r\ndisappearing completely. In the other two surviving Dipnoans, similar\r\nlarge teeth exist, though here there is no longer trace in ontogeny of\r\ntheir formation by the basal fusion of originally separate denticles. In\r\nthe Selachians the bony skeleton is restricted to the placoid elements.\r\nIn the Teleostomes and the Dipnoans the original cartilaginous skeleton\r\nbecomes to a great extent unsheathed or replaced by bony tissue. It\r\nseems highly probable that the more deeply seated osseous elements\r\noccurring in these as in the higher groups arose in the course of\r\nevolution by the spreading inwards of bony trabeculae from the bases of\r\nthe placoid elements. Such a method has been demonstrated as occurring\r\nin individual development in the case of certain of the more\r\nsuperficially placed bones.[32]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.--A, Cycloid Scale of _Scopelus resplendens_\r\n(magn.). B, Ctenoid Scale of _Lethrinus_ (magn.).]\r\n\r\n  The placoid element with its cap of enamel secreted by the ectoderm is\r\n  probably originally derived from a local thickening of the basement\r\n  membrane which with the external cuticle may be looked on as the most\r\n  ancient skeletal structure in the Metazoa. The basal plate appears to\r\n  have been a later development than the spine; in the palaeozoic\r\n  _Coelolepidae_[33] the basal plate is apparently not yet developed.\r\n\r\nOnly a brief summary can be given here of the leading features in the\r\nosteology of fishes. Care must be taken not to assume that bony elements\r\nbearing the same name in fishes and in other groups, or even in the\r\nvarious sub-divisions of the fishes, are necessarily strictly\r\nhomologous. In all probability bony elements occupying similar positions\r\nand described by the same anatomical name have been evolved\r\nindependently from the ancestral covering of placoid elements.\r\n\r\n_Teleostei._--It will be convenient to take as the basis of our\r\ndescription the bony skeleton of such a Teleostean fish as the salmon.\r\nIn the vertebral column all the cartilaginous elements are replaced by\r\nbone. The haemal spines of the turned-up tip of the tail are flattened\r\n(hypural bones) and serve to support the caudal fin rays.\r\n\r\nIn _Argyropelecus_ and in one or two deep-sea forms the vertebral column\r\nremains cartilaginous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From Parker & Haswell's _Text-book of Zoology_, by\r\npermission of Messrs. Macmillan & Co., Ltd.\r\n\r\nFIG. 23.--One of the radialia of the salmon, consisting of three\r\nsegments, ptg¹, ptg², ptg³, and supporting a dermal fin ray. _D.F.R._]\r\n\r\nApart from the ossification of the radialia which takes place in the\r\nadults of bony fishes there exist special supporting structures in the\r\nfins (paired as well as median) of all the gnathostomatous fishes and\r\napparently in nature independent of the cartilaginous skeleton. These\r\nare known as dermal fin-rays.[34] Morphologically they are probably to\r\nbe looked on (like placoid elements) as local exaggerations of the\r\nbasement membrane.\r\n\r\n  In their detailed characters two main types of dermal fin-ray may be\r\n  recognized. The first of these are horny unjointed rays and occur in\r\n  the fins of Selachians and at the edge of the fins of Teleostomes\r\n  (well seen in the small posterior dorsal or \"adipose\" fin,\r\n  particularly in Siluroids). The second type of dermal fin-ray is\r\n  originally arranged in pairs and forms the main supports of the fin in\r\n  the adult Teleost (fig. 23). The members of each pair are in close\r\n  contact except proximally where they separate and embrace the tip of\r\n  one of the radialia. The fin-rays of this second type are frequently\r\n  branched and jointed: in other cases they form unbranched rigid\r\n  spines.\r\n\r\n  In the angler or fishing-frog (_Lophius_) the anterior rays of the\r\n  dorsal fin become greatly elongated to form small fishing-rods, from\r\n  which depend bait-like lures for the attraction of its prey.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From Wiedersheim, _Verg.

Of cartilage bones four are developed round the\r\nforamen magnum--the basioccipital, supraoccipital and two exoccipitals.\r\nIn front of the basioccipital is the basisphenoid with an alisphenoid on\r\neach side. The region (presphenoidal) immediately in front of the\r\nbasisphenoid is unossified, but on each side of it an orbitosphenoid is\r\ndeveloped, the two orbitosphenoids being closely approximated in the\r\nmesial plane and to a certain extent fused, forming the upper part of\r\nthe interorbital septum. In the anterior or ethmoidal portion of the\r\ncranium the only cartilage bones are a pair of lateral ethmoids lying\r\nat the anterior boundary of the orbit. A series of five distinct\r\nelements are ossified in the wall of the auditory or otic capsule, the\r\nprootic and opisthotic more ventrally, and the sphenotic, pterotic and\r\nepiotic more dorsally. The roof of the cranium is covered in by the\r\nfollowing dermal bones--parietals (on each side of the supraoccipital),\r\nfrontals, dermal ethmoid and small nasals, one over each olfactory\r\norgan. The floor of the cranium on its oral aspect is ensheathed by the\r\nlarge parasphenoid and the smaller vomer in front of and overlapping it.\r\nThe cartilaginous lower jaw is ossified posteriorly to form the\r\narticular (fig. 25) with a small membrane bone, the angular, ventral to\r\nit, but the main part of the jaw is replaced functionally by a large\r\nmembrane bone which ensheaths it--the dentary--evolved in all\r\nprobability by the spreading outwards of bony tissue from the bases of\r\nthe placoid elements (teeth) which it bears. The original upper jaw\r\n(palatopterygoid bar) is replaced by a chain of bones--palatine in\r\nfront, then pterygoid and mesopterygoid, and posteriorly metapterygoid\r\nand quadrate, the latter giving articulation to the articular bone of\r\nthe lower jaw. These representatives of the palatopterygoid bar no\r\nlonger form the functional upper jaw. This function is performed by\r\nmembrane bones which have appeared external to the palatopterygoid\r\nbar--the premaxilla and maxilla--which carry teeth--and the small\r\nscale-like jugal behind them. The quadrate is suspended from the skull\r\nas in the Selachians (hyostylic skull) by the upper portion of the hyoid\r\narch--here represented by two bones--the hyomandibular and symplectic.\r\nThe ventral portion of the hyoid arch is also represented by a chain of\r\nbones (stylohyal, epihyal, ceratohyal, hypohyal and the ventral unpaired\r\nbasihyal), as is also each of the five branchial arches behind it. In\r\naddition to the bony elements belonging to the hyoid arch proper a\r\nseries of membrane bones support the opercular flap. Ventrally there\r\nproject backwards from the ceratohyal a series of ten overlapping\r\nbranchiostegal rays, while more dorsally are the broader interopercular,\r\nsubopercular and opercular.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From Wiedersheim, _Verg.

Zunge, Tongue.]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the bones already enumerated there is present a ring of\r\ncircumorbital bones, a preopercular, behind and external to the\r\nhyomandibular and quadrate, and squamosal, external to the hinder end of\r\nthe auditory capsule.\r\n\r\n  In the salmon, pike, and various other Teleosts, extensive regions of\r\n  the chondrocranium persist in the adult, while in others (e.g. the\r\n  cod) the replacement by bone is practically complete. Bony elements\r\n  may be developed in addition to those noticed in the salmon.\r\n\r\n  In the sturgeon the chondrocranium is ensheathed by numerous membrane\r\n  bones, but cartilage bones are absent. In the Crossopterygians[35] the\r\n  chondrocranium persists to a great extent in the adult, but portions\r\n  of it are replaced by cartilage bones--the most interesting being a\r\n  large sphenethmoid like that of the frog. Numerous membrane bones\r\n  cover the chondrocranium externally. In the Dipneusti[36] the\r\n  chondrocranium is strengthened in the adult by numerous bones. One of\r\n  the most characteristic is the great palatopterygoid bone which\r\n  develops very early by the spreading of ossification backwards from\r\n  the tooth bases, and whose early development probably accounts for the\r\n  non-development of the palatopterygoid cartilage.\r\n\r\n_Appendicular Skeleton._--The primitive pectoral girdle, which in the\r\nDipneusti is strengthened by a sheath of bone, becomes in the\r\nTeleostomes reduced in size (small scapula and coracoid bones) and\r\nreplaced functionally by a secondary shoulder girdle formed of\r\nsuperficially placed membrane bones (supraclavicular and cleithrum or\r\n\"clavicle,\" with, in addition in certain cases, an infraclavicular and\r\none or two postclavicular elements), and connected at its dorsal end\r\nwith the skull by a post-temporal bone.\r\n\r\nThe pelvic girdle is in Teleostomes completely absent as a rule.\r\n\r\nThe skeleton of the free limb undergoes ossification to a less or\r\ngreater extent in the Teleostomes.\r\n\r\n  In _Polypterus_ the pectoral fin (fig. 18, B) shows three\r\n  ossifications in the basal part of the fin--pro-, meso- and\r\n  metapterygium. Of these the metapterygium probably represents the\r\n  ossified skeletal axis: while the propterygium and also the numerous\r\n  diverging radials probably represent the lateral rays of one side of\r\n  the archipterygium.\r\n\r\n  In the _Teleostomes_ the place of the pelvic girdle is taken\r\n  functionally by an element apparently formed by the fusion of the\r\n  basal portions of several radials.\r\n\r\n_Vascular System._--The main components of the blood vascular system in\r\nthe lower vertebrates are the following: (1) a single or double dorsal\r\naorta lying between the enteron and notochord; (2) a ventral vessel\r\nlying beneath the enteron; and (3) a series of paired hoop-like aortic\r\narches connecting dorsal and ventral vessels round the sides of the\r\npharynx. The blood-stream passes forwards towards the head in the\r\nventral vessel, dorsalwards through the aortic arches, and tailwards in\r\nthe dorsal aorta.\r\n\r\nThe dorsal aorta is single throughout the greater part of its extent,\r\nbut for a greater or less extent at its anterior end (_circulus\r\ncephalicus_) it consists of two paired aortic roots. It is impossible to\r\nsay whether the paired or the unpaired condition is the more primitive,\r\ngeneral morphological conditions being in favour of the latter, while\r\nembryological evidence rather supports the former. The dorsal aorta,\r\nwhich receives its highly oxygenated blood from the aortic arches, is\r\nthe main artery for the distribution of this oxygenated blood.\r\nAnteriorly the aortic roots are continued forwards as the dorsal carotid\r\narteries to supply the head region. A series of paired,\r\nsegmentally-arranged arteries pass from the dorsal aorta to supply the\r\nmuscular body wall, and the branches which supply the pectoral and\r\npelvic fins (subclavian or brachial artery, and iliac artery) are\r\nprobably specially enlarged members of this series of segmental vessels.\r\nBesides these paired vessels a varying number of unpaired branches pass\r\nfrom dorsal aorta to the wall of the alimentary canal with its glandular\r\ndiverticula (coeliac, mesenteric, rectal).\r\n\r\nThe ventral vessel undergoes complicated changes and is represented in\r\nthe adults of existing fishes by a series of important structures. Its\r\npost-anal portion comes with the atrophy of the post-anal gut to lie\r\nclose under the caudal portion of the dorsal aorta and is known as the\r\ncaudal vein. This assumes a secondary connexion with, and drains its\r\nblood into, the posterior cardinal veins (see below). In the region\r\nbetween cloaca and liver the ventral vessel becomes much branched or\r\neven reticular and--serving serving to convey the food-laden blood from\r\nthe wall of the enteron to the capillary network of the liver--is known\r\nas the hepatic portal vein. The short section in front of the liver is\r\nknown as the hepatic vein and this conveys the blood, which has been\r\ntreated by the liver, into a section of the ventral vessel, which has\r\nbecome highly muscular and is rhythmically contractile. This enlarged\r\nmuscular portion, in which the contractility--probably once common to\r\nthe main vessels throughout their extent--has become concentrated,\r\nserves as a pump and is known as the heart. Finally the precardiac\r\nsection of the ventral vessel--the ventral aorta--conveys the blood from\r\nheart to aortic arches.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the vessels mentioned a large paired vein is developed in\r\nclose relation to the renal organ which it serves to drain. This is the\r\nposterior cardinal. An anterior prolongation (anterior cardinal) serves\r\nto drain the blood from the head region. From the point of junction of\r\nanterior and posterior cardinal a large transverse vessel leads to the\r\nheart (_ductus Cuvieri_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From Boas, _Lehrbuch der Zoologie_, by permission of\r\nGustav Fischer.\r\n\r\nFig. 26.--Diagram to illustrate the condition of the Conus in an\r\nElasmobranch (A), _Amia_ (B) and a typical Teleost (C).\r\n\r\n  a,    Atrium.            v,v´, Valves.\r\n  b.a,  Bulbus aortae.     v.a,  Ventral aorta.\r\n  c.a,  Conus arteriosus.  vt,   Ventricle.]\r\n  s.v,  Sinus venosus.\r\n\r\n_Heart._--Originally a simple tube curved into a somewhat S-shape, the\r\nheart, by enlargements, constrictions and fusions of its parts, becomes\r\nconverted into the complex, compact heart of the adult. In this we\r\nrecognize the following portions--(1) _Sinus venosus_, (2) _Atrium_, (3)\r\n_Ventricle_. A fourth chamber, the _conus arteriosus_, the enlarged and\r\ncontractile hinder end of the ventral aorta, is also physiologically a\r\npart of the heart. The sinus venosus receives the blood from the great\r\nveins (ductus Cuvieri and hepatic veins). It--like the atrium which it\r\nenters by an opening guarded by two lateral valves--has thin though\r\ncontractile walls. The atrium is as a rule single, but in the Dipnoans,\r\nin correlation with the importance of their pulmonary breathing, it is\r\nincompletely divided into a right and a left auricle. In Neoceratodus\r\nthe incomplete division is effected by the presence of a longitudinal\r\nshelf projecting into the atrial cavity from its posterior wall. The\r\nopening of the sinus venosus is to the right of this shell, that of the\r\npulmonary vein to the left. In _Prototerus_ and _Lepidosiren_ a nearly\r\ncomplete septum is formed by the fusion of trabeculae, there being only\r\na minute opening in it posteriorly. The atrium opens by a wide opening\r\nguarded by two or more flap valves provided with chordae tendineae into\r\nthe ventricle.\r\n\r\nThe ventricle, in correspondence with it being the main pumping\r\napparatus, has its walls much thickened by the development of muscular\r\ntrabeculae which, in the lower forms separated by wide spaces in which\r\nmost of the blood is contained, become in the Teleostomes so enlarged as\r\nto give the wall a compact character, the spaces being reduced to small\r\nscattered openings on its inner surface. In the Dipnoans the ventricle,\r\nlike the atrium, is incompletely divided into a right and left\r\nventricle. In _Ceratodus_ this is effected by an extension of the\r\ninterauricular shelf into the ventricle. In _Lepidosiren_ the separation\r\nof the two ventricles is complete but for a small perforation\r\nanteriorly, the heart in this respect showing a closer approximation to\r\nthe condition in the higher vertebrates than is found in any Amphibians\r\nor in any reptiles except the Crocodilia. The conus arteriosus is of\r\ninterest from the valvular arrangements in its interior to prevent\r\nregurgitation of blood from ventral aorta into ventricle. In their\r\nsimplest condition, as seen e.g. in an embryonic Selachian, these\r\narrangements consist of three, four or more prominent longitudinal\r\nridges projecting into the lumen of the conus, and serving to obliterate\r\nthe lumen when jammed together by the systole of the conus. As\r\ndevelopment goes on each of these ridges becomes segmented into a row of\r\npocket valves with their openings directed anteriorly so that\r\nregurgitation causes them to open out and occlude the lumen by their\r\nfree edges meeting. Amongst the Teleostomes the lower ganoids show a\r\nsimilar development of longitudinal rows of valves in the conus. In\r\n_Amia_ (fig. 26, B), however, the conus is shortened and the number of\r\nvalves in each longitudinal row is much reduced. This leads to the\r\ncondition found in the Teleosts (fig. 26, O), where practically all\r\ntrace of the conus has disappeared, a single circle of valves\r\nrepresenting a last survivor of each row (save in a few exceptional\r\ncases, e.g. _Albula_, _Tarpen_, _Osteoglossum_, where two valves of each\r\nrow are present).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: After Newton Parker, from _Trans. of the Royal Irish\r\nAcademy_, vol. xxx.\r\n\r\nFIG. 27.--Venous System of _Protopterus_, as seen from ventral side.\r\n\r\n  a,     Atrium.                  k,     Kidney.\r\n  ac,    Anterior cardinal.       l,     Liver.\r\n  an.v,  Anastomotic vein.        ov.v,  Ovarian veins.\r\n  c,     Intestine.               p,     Pericardium.\r\n  c.v,   Caudal vein.             p.c.v, Left posterior cardinal.\r\n  f.v,   Femoral vein.            p.v´,  Parietal veins.\r\n  g.b,   Gall-bladder.            r.p.v, Renal portal.\r\n  h.v,   Hepatic vein.            s,     Stomach.\r\n  i.j.v, Inferior jugular vein.   s.b.v, Subclavian.]\r\n  i.v.c, Posterior vena cava.\r\n\r\n  In Front of the conus vestige of the Teleost there is present a thick\r\n  walled _bulbus aortae_ differing from the conus in not being\r\n  rhythmically contractile, its walls being on the contrary richly\r\n  provided with elastic tissue.\r\n\r\nThe Dipnoans[37] show an important advance on the conus as in atrium and\r\nventricle. The conus has a characteristic spiral twist. Within it in\r\n_Neoceratodus_ are a number of longitudinal rows of pocket valves. One\r\nof these rows is marked out by the very large size of its valves and by\r\nthe fact that they are not distinct from one another but even in the\r\nadult form a continuous, spirally-running, longitudinal fold. This ridge\r\nprojecting into the lumen of the conus divides it incompletely into two\r\nchannels, the one beginning (i.e. at its hinder end) on the _left_ side\r\nand ending in front _ventrally_, the other beginning on the _right_ and\r\nending _dorsally_. In _Protopterus_ a similar condition occurs, only in\r\nthe front end of the conus a second spiral fold is present opposite the\r\nfirst and, meeting this, completes the division of the conus cavity into\r\ntwo separate parts. The rows of pocket valves which do not enter into\r\nthe formation of the spiral folds are here greatly reduced.\r\n\r\nThese arrangements in the conus of the Dipnoans are of the highest\r\nmorphological interest, pointing in an unmistakable way towards the\r\ncondition found in the higher lung-breathing vertebrates. Of the two\r\ncavities into which the conus is partially divided in the Dipneusti the\r\none which begins posteriorly on the right receives the (venous) blood\r\nfrom the right side of the heart, and ending up anteriorly dorsal to the\r\nother cavity communicates only with aortic arches V. and VI. In the\r\nhigher vertebrates this cavity has become completely split off to form\r\nthe root of the pulmonary arteries, and a result of aortic arch V.\r\nreceiving its blood along with the functionally much more important VI.\r\n(the pulmonary arch) from this special part of the conus has been the\r\nalmost complete disappearance of this arch (V.) in all the higher\r\nvertebrates.\r\n\r\n_Arterial System._--There are normally six aortic arches laid down\r\ncorresponding with the visceral arches, the first (mandibular) and\r\nsecond (hyoidean) undergoing atrophy to a less or greater extent in\r\npost-embryonic life. Where an external gill is present the aortic arch\r\nloops out into this, a kind of short-circuiting of the blood-stream\r\ntaking place as the external gill atrophies. As the walls of the clefts\r\nassume their respiratory function the aortic arch becomes broken into a\r\nnetwork of capillaries in its respiratory portion, and there is now\r\ndistinguished a ventral afferent and a dorsal efferent portion of each\r\narch. Complicated developmental changes, into which it is unnecessary to\r\nenter,[38] may lead to each efferent vessel draining the two sides of a\r\nsingle cleft instead of the adjacent walls of two clefts as it does\r\nprimitively. In the Crossopterygians and Dipnoans as in the higher\r\nvertebrates the sixth aortic arch gives off the pulmonary artery to the\r\nlung. Among the Actinopterygians this, probably primitive, blood-supply\r\nto the lung (swimbladder) persists only in _Amia_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.--Venous System of Polypterus 30 mm. larva\r\n(dorsal view).\r\n\r\n  a.c.v, Anterior cardinal vein.\r\n  d.C,   Ductus Cuvieri.\r\n  h.v,   Hepatic vein.\r\n  i.j.v, Inferior jugular vein.\r\n  ir.v,  Inter-renal vein.\r\n  l.v,   Lateral cutaneous vein.\r\n  p.c.v, Posterior cardinal vein.\r\n  p.n,   Pronephros.\r\n  p.v,   Pulmonary vein.\r\n  s,     Subclavian vein.\r\n  s.v,   Sinus venosus.\r\n  th,    Thyroid.\r\n  v,     Vein from pharyngeal wall.\r\n  *      Anterior portion of left posterior cardinal vein.]\r\n\r\n_Venous System._--The most interesting variations from the general plan\r\noutlined have to do with the arrangements of the posterior cardinals. In\r\nthe Selachians these are in their anterior portion wide and sinuslike,\r\nwhile in the region of the kidney they become broken into a sinusoidal\r\nnetwork supplied by the postrenal portion now known as the renal portal\r\nvein. In the Teleostomes the chief noteworthy feature is the tendency to\r\nasymmetry, the right posterior cardinal being frequently considerably\r\nlarger than the left and connected with it by transverse anastomotic\r\nvessels, the result being that most of the blood from the two kidneys\r\npasses forwards by the right posterior cardinal. The Dipnoans (fig. 27)\r\nshow a similar asymmetry, but here the anterior end of the right\r\nposterior cardinal disappears, being replaced functionally by a new\r\nvessel which conveys the blood from the right posterior cardinal direct\r\nto the sinus venosus instead of to the outer end of the ductus Cuvieri.\r\nThis new vessel is the posterior vena cava which thus in the series of\r\nvertebrates appears for the first time in the Dipneusti.\r\n\r\n_Pulmonary Veins._--In _Polypterus_ (fig. 28) the blood is drained from\r\nthe lungs by a pulmonary vein on each side which unites in front with\r\nits fellow and opens into the great hepatic vein behind the heart. In\r\nthe Dipnoans the conjoined pulmonary veins open directly into the left\r\nsection of the atrium as in higher forms. In the Actinopterygians with\r\ntheir specialized air-bladder the blood passes to the heart via\r\nposterior cardinals, or hepatic portal, or--a probably more primitive\r\ncondition--directly into the left ductus Cuvieri (_Amia_).\r\n\r\n_Lymphatics._--More or less irregular lymphatic spaces occur in the\r\nfishes as elsewhere and, as in the Amphibia, localized muscular\r\ndevelopments are present forming lymph hearts.\r\n\r\n_Central Nervous System._--The neural tube shows in very early stages an\r\nanterior dilated portion which forms the rudiment of the brain in\r\ncontradistinction to the hinder, narrower part which forms the spinal\r\ncord. This enlargement of the brain is correlated with the increasing\r\npredominance of the nerve centres at the anterior end of the body which\r\ntend to assume more and more complete control over those lying behind.\r\n\r\n_Spinal Cord._--A remarkable peculiarity occurs in the sun fishes\r\n(_Molidae_), where the body is greatly shortened and where the spinal\r\ncord undergoes a corresponding abbreviation so as to be actually shorter\r\nthan the brain.\r\n\r\n_Brain._--It is customary to divide the brain into three main regions,\r\nfore-, mid-, and hind-brain, as in the most familiar vertebrates there\r\nis frequently seen in the embryo a division of the primitive brain\r\ndilatation into three vesicles lying one behind the other. A\r\nconsideration of the development of the brain in the various main groups\r\nof vertebrates shows that these divisions are not of equal importance.\r\nIn those archaic groups where the egg is not encumbered by the presence\r\nof a large mass of yolk it is usual for the brain to show in its early\r\nstages a division into two main regions which we may term the primitive\r\nfore-brain or cerebrum and the primitive hind-brain or rhombencephalon.\r\nOnly later does the hinder part of the primitive fore-brain become\r\nmarked off as mid-brain. In the fully developed brain it is customary to\r\nrecognize the series of regions indicated below, though the boundaries\r\nbetween these regions are not mathematical lines or surfaces any more\r\nthan are any other biological boundaries:--\r\n\r\n  Rhombencephalon (Hind-brain)     / Myelencephalon (Medulla oblongata).\r\n                                   \\ Metencephalon (Cerebellum).\r\n\r\n                                   / Mesencephalon (Mid-brain).\r\n  Cerebrum (Primitive Fore-brain) <  Thalamencephalon (Diencephalon).\r\n                                   \\ [Hemispheres (Telencephalon).]\r\n\r\nThe myelencephalon or medulla oblongata calls for no special remark,\r\nexcept that in the case of _Torpedo_ there is a special upward bulging\r\nof its floor on each side of the middle line forming the electric lobe\r\nand containing the nucleus of origin of the nerves to the electric\r\norgan.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A and B from Wiedersheim, by permission of Gustav\r\nFischer.\r\n\r\nFIG. 29.--Brain of _Scyllium_ (A), _Salmo_ (B) and _Lepidosiren_ (C).\r\nThe three figures are not drawn to the same scale.\r\n\r\n  cer,  Cerebellum.\r\n  c.h,  Cerebral hemisphere.\r\n  th,   Thalamencephalon.\r\n  f.b,  Primitive fore-brain (in B the line points to the thickened\r\n          wall of the fore-brain, the so-called \"basal ganglia\").\r\n  G.p,  Pineal body.\r\n  m.b,  Roof of mid-brain, optic lobes, _tectum opticum_.\r\n  o.l,  Olfactory lobe.\r\n  IV.v, Fourth ventricle.]\r\n\r\nThe cerebellum occurs in its simplest form in lampreys and Dipnoans\r\n(fig. 29, C), where it forms a simple band-like thickening of the\r\nanterior end of the roof of the hind-brain. In Selachians it is very\r\nlarge and bulges upwards, forming a conspicuous organ in a dorsal view\r\nof the brain (fig. 29, A). In Teleosts (fig. 29, B) the cerebellum is\r\nalso large. It projects back as a great tongue-like structure over the\r\nroof of the fourth ventricle, while in front it dips downwards and\r\nprojects under the roof of the mid-brain forming a highly characteristic\r\n_valvula cerebelli_. A _valvula cerebelli_ occurs also in ganoids, while\r\nin the Crossopterygians a similar extension of the cerebellum projects\r\nbackwards into the IV. ventricle or cavity of the hind-brain (fig. 30).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mesencephalon is a conspicuous structure in the fishes from its\r\ngreatly developed roof (_tectum opticum_) which receives the end pencils\r\nof the optic nerve. Normally it projects upwards as a pair of large\r\noptic lobes, but in the Dipnoans (fig. 29, C) the lateral thickening is\r\nnot sufficiently great to cause obvious lateral swellings in external\r\nview.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.--Median Longitudinal Section through the brain\r\nof _Lepidosiren_ and _Polypterus_.

Even in\r\n_Amphioxus_ the appearance of a sagittal section strongly suggests\r\nvestiges of a once present thalamencephalon.[39] The roof--like that of\r\nthe myelencephalon--remains to a great extent membranous, forming with\r\nthe closely applied _pia mater_ a vascular roof to the III. ventricle.\r\nFrequently a transverse fold of the roof dips down into the III.\r\nventricle forming the _velum transversum_ (fig. 30).\r\n\r\nThe side walls of the thalamencephalon are greatly thickened forming the\r\n_thalamus_ (epithalamus and hypothalamus), while a ganglionic thickening\r\nof the roof posteriorly on each side forms the _ganglia habenulae_ which\r\nreceive olfactory fibres from the base of the hemisphere. The habenular\r\nganglia are unusually large in the lampreys and are here strongly\r\nasymmetrical, the right being the larger.\r\n\r\nThe floor of the thalamencephalon projects downwards and backwards as\r\nthe infundibulum. The side walls of this are thickened to form\r\ncharacteristic _lobi inferiores_, while the blind end develops glandular\r\noutgrowths (infundibular gland, fig. 30) overlaid by a rich development\r\nof blood sinuses and forming with them the _saccus vasculosus_. The\r\noptic chiasma, where present, is involved in the floor of the\r\nthalamencephalon and forms a large, upwardly-projecting ridge. Farther\r\nforwards on the floor or anterior wall is the anterior commissure (see\r\nbelow).\r\n\r\nPassing forwards from the mid-brain (cf. fig. 30) a series of\r\ninteresting structures are found connected with the roof of the\r\nprimitive fore-brain, viz.--posterior commissure (intercalary region),\r\npineal organ, habenular commissure with anterior parietal organ, dorsal\r\nsac (= pineal cushion), _velum transversum_, paraphysis. The posterior\r\ncommissure is situated in the boundary between thalamencephalon and\r\nmid-brain. It is formed of fibres connecting up the right and left\r\nsides of the tectum opticum (?). The habenular or superior commissure\r\nsituated farther forwards connects the two ganglia habenulae. In the\r\nimmediate neighbourhood of these ganglia there project upwards two\r\ndiverticula of the brain-roof known as the pineal organ and the\r\nparapineal (or anterior parietal) organ. The special interest of these\r\norgans[40] lies in the fact that in certain vertebrates one (parapineal\r\nin _Sphenodon_ and in lizards) or both (_Petromyzon_) exhibit\r\nhistological features which show that they must be looked on as visual\r\norgans or eyes. In gnathostomatous fishes they do not show any definite\r\neye-like structure, but in certain cases (_Polyodon_, _Callichthys_,\r\n&c.) the bony plates of the skull-roof are discontinuous over the pineal\r\norgan forming a definite parietal foramen such as exists in lizards\r\nwhere the eye-like structure is distinct. It is also usual to find in\r\nthe epithelial wall of the pineal organ columnar cells which show\r\nclub-shaped ends projecting into the lumen (exactly as in the young\r\nvisual cells of the retina[41]) and are prolonged into a root-like\r\nprocess at the other end. Definite nerve fibres pass down from these\r\nparietal organs to the brain. It is stated that the fibres from the\r\npineal organ pass into the posterior commissure, those of the parapineal\r\norgan into the habenular commissure.\r\n\r\nThe facts mentioned render it difficult to avoid the conclusion that\r\nthese organs either have been sensory or are sensory. Possibly they\r\nrepresent the degenerate and altered vestiges of eye-like organs present\r\nin archaic vertebrates, or it may be that they represent the remains of\r\norgans not eye-like in function but which for some other reason lay\r\nclose under the surface of the body. It would seem natural that a\r\ndiverticulum of brain-tissue exposed to the influence of light-rays\r\nshould exhibit the same reaction as is shown frequently elsewhere in the\r\nanimal kingdom and tend to assume secondarily the characters of a visual\r\norgan. The presence of the rod-like features in the epithelial cells is\r\nperhaps in favour of the latter view. In evolution we should expect\r\nthese to appear before the camera-like structure of a highly developed\r\neye, while in the process of degeneration we should expect these fine\r\nhistological characters to go first.\r\n\r\n  Selachians.--No parapineal organ is present. The pineal body (except\r\n  in _Torpedo_ where it is absent) is in the form of a long slender tube\r\n  ending in front in a dilated bulb lying near the front end of the\r\n  brain in close contact with, or enclosed in, a definite foramen in the\r\n  cranial roof.\r\n\r\n  Holocephali and Crossopterygii.--Here also the pineal body is long and\r\n  tubular: at its origin it passes dorsalwards or slightly backwards\r\n  behind the large dorsal sac.\r\n\r\n  Actinopterygian Ganoids resemble Selachians on the whole. In _Amia_ a\r\n  parapineal organ is present, and it is said to lie towards the left\r\n  side and to be connected by a thick nerve with the _left_ habenular\r\n  ganglion (cf. _Petromyzon_, article CYCLOSTOMATA). This is adduced to\r\n  support the view that the pineal and parapineal bodies represent\r\n  originally paired structures.\r\n\r\n  Teleostei.--A parapineal rudiment appears in the embryo of some forms,\r\n  but in the adult only the pineal organ is known to exist. This is\r\n  usually short and club-shaped, its terminal part with much folded wall\r\n  and glandular in character. In a few cases a parietal foramen occurs\r\n  (_Callichthys_, _Loricaria_, &c.).\r\n\r\n  Dipneusti.--The pineal organ is short and simple. No parapineal organ\r\n  is developed.\r\n\r\nThe dorsal sac is formed by that part of the roof of the\r\nthalamencephalon lying between the habenular commissure and the region\r\nof the velum. In some cases a longitudinal groove is present in which\r\nthe pineal organ lies (Dipneusti). In the Crossopterygians the dorsal\r\nsac is particularly large and was formerly mistaken for the pineal\r\norgan.\r\n\r\nThe _velum transversum_ is a transverse, inwardly-projecting fold of the\r\nroof of the primitive fore-brain in front of the dorsal sac. To those\r\nmorphologists who regard the hemisphere region or telencephalon as a\r\nprimitively unpaired structure the velum is an important landmark\r\nindicating the posterior limit of the telencephalon. Those who hold the\r\nview taken in this article that the hemispheres are to be regarded as\r\npaired outpushings of the side wall of the primitive fore-brain\r\nattribute less morphological importance to the velum. Physiologically\r\nthe velum is frequently important from the plexus of blood-vessels which\r\npasses with it into the III. ventricle.\r\n\r\nIn _Petromyzon_ and _Chimaera_ the velum is not developed. In Dipnoans\r\nthere are present in its place _paired_ transverse folds which are\r\nprobably merely extensions backwards of the lateral plexuses.\r\n\r\nThe Paraphysis is a projection from the roof of the primitive fore-brain\r\nnear its anterior end. It is well seen in Dipnoans[42] (_Lepidosiren_\r\nand _Protopterus_) where in the larva (exactly as in the urodele larva)\r\nit forms a blindly ending tube sloping upwards and forwards between the\r\ntwo hemispheres. In the adult it becomes mixed with the two lateral\r\nplexuses and is liable to be confused with them. In the other\r\ngroups--except the Teleosts where it is small (_Anguilla_) or absent\r\n(most Teleosts)--the paraphysis is by no means such a definite\r\nstructure, but generally there is present a more or less branched and\r\ndivided diverticulum of the brain wall, frequently glandular, which is\r\nhomologized with the paraphysis. The morphological significance of the\r\nparaphysis is uncertain. It may represent the remains of an ancient\r\nsense organ, or it may simply represent the last connexion between the\r\nbrain and the external ectoderm from which it was derived.\r\n\r\nAn important derivative of the primitive fore-brain is seen in the pair\r\nof cerebral hemispheres which in the higher vertebrates become of such\r\nrelatively gigantic dimensions. The hemispheres appear to be primitively\r\nassociated with the special sense of smell, and they are prolonged\r\nanteriorly into a pair of olfactory lobes which come into close relation\r\nwith the olfactory organ. From a consideration of their adult relations\r\nand of their development--particularly in those groups where there is no\r\ndisturbing factor in the shape of a large yolk sac--it seems probable\r\nthat the hemispheres are primitively paired outpushings of the lateral\r\nwall of the primitive fore-brain[43]--in order to give increased space\r\nfor the increased mass of nervous matter associated with the olfactory\r\nsense. They are most highly developed in the Dipneusti amongst fishes.\r\nThey are there (cf. fig. 29, C) of relatively enormous size with thick\r\nnervous floor (corpus striatum) and side walls and roof (pallium)\r\nsurrounding a central cavity (lateral ventricle) which opens into the\r\nthird ventricle. At the posterior end of the hemisphere a small area of\r\nits wall remains thin and membranous, and this becomes pushed into the\r\nlateral ventricle by an ingrowth of blood-vessel to form the huge\r\nlateral plexus ( = _plexus hemisphaerium_). In this great size of the\r\nhemispheres[44] and also in the presence of a rudimentary cortex in the\r\nDipnoi we see, as in many other features in these fishes, a distinct\r\nforeshadowing of conditions occurring in the higher groups of\r\nvertebrates. The Cyclostomes possess a distinct though small pair of\r\nhemispheres. In the Selachians the relatively archaic _Notidanidae_[45]\r\npossess a pair of thick-walled hemispheres, but in the majority of the\r\nmembers of the group the paired condition is obscured (fig. 29, A).\r\n\r\nIn the Teleostomes the mass of nervous matter which in other groups\r\nforms the hemispheres does not undergo any pushing outwards except as\r\nregards the small olfactory lobes. On the contrary, it remains as a\r\ngreat thickening of the lateral wall of the thalamencephalon (the\r\nso-called basal ganglia), additional space for which, however, may be\r\nobtained by a considerable increase in length of the fore-brain region\r\n(cf. fig. 30, A) or by actual involution into the third ventricle\r\n(_Polypterus_).[46] The great nervous thickenings of the\r\nthalamencephalic wall bulge into its cavity and are covered over by the\r\nthin epithelial roof of the thalamencephalon which is as a consequence\r\nliable to be confused with the pallium or roof of the hemispheres with\r\nwhich it has nothing to do: the homologue of the pallium as of other\r\nparts of the hemisphere is contained within the lateral thickening of\r\nthe thelamencephalic wall, not in its membranous roof.[47]\r\n\r\nAssociated with the parts of the fore-brain devoted to the sense of\r\nsmell (especially the corpora striata) is the important system of\r\nbridging fibres forming the anterior commissure which lies near the\r\nanterior end of the floor, or in the front wall, of the primitive\r\nfore-brain. It is of great interest to note the appearance in the\r\n_Dipnoans_ (_Lepidosiren_ and _Protopterus_) of a corpus callosum (cf.\r\nfig. 30 B) lying dorsal to the anterior commissure and composed of\r\nfibres connected with the pallial region of the two hemispheres.\r\n\r\n_Sense Organs._--The olfactory organs are of special interest in the\r\nSelachians, where each remains through life as a widely-open, saccular\r\ninvolution of the ectoderm which may be prolonged backwards to the\r\nmargin of the buccal cavity by an open oronasal groove, thus retaining a\r\ncondition familiar in the embryo of the higher vertebrates. In Dipnoans\r\nthe olfactory organ communicates with the roof of the buccal cavity by\r\ndefinite posterior nares as in the higher forms--the communicating\r\npassage being doubtless the morphological equivalent of the oronasal\r\ngroove, although there is no direct embryological evidence for this. In\r\nthe Teleostomes the olfactory organ varies from a condition of great\r\ncomplexity in the Crossopterygians down to a condition of almost\r\ncomplete atrophy in certain Teleosts (Plectognathi).[48]\r\n\r\nThe _eyes_ are usually of large size. The lens is large and spherical\r\nand in the case of most Teleostomes accommodation for distant vision is\r\neffected by the lens being pulled bodily nearer the retina. This\r\nmovement is brought about by the contraction of smooth muscle fibres\r\ncontained in the _processus falciformis_, a projection from the choroid\r\nwhich terminates in contact with the lens in a swelling, the _campanula\r\nHalleri_. In _Amia_ and in Teleosts a network of capillaries forming the\r\nso-called choroid gland surrounds the optic nerve just outside the\r\nretina. As a rule the eyes of fishes have a silvery, shining appearance\r\ndue to the deposition of shining flakes of guanin in the outer layer of\r\nthe choroid (_Argentea_) or, in the case of Selachians, in the inner\r\nlayers (_tapetum_). Fishes which inhabit dark recesses, e.g. of caves or\r\nof the deep sea, show an enlargement, or, more frequently, a reduction,\r\nof the eyes. Certain deep-sea Teleosts possess remarkable telescopic\r\neyes with a curious asymmetrical development of the retina.[49]\r\n\r\nThe otocyst or auditory organ agrees in its main features with that of\r\nother vertebrates. In Selachians the otocyst remains in the adult open\r\nto the exterior by the _ductus endolymphaticus_. In _Squatina_[50] this\r\nis unusually wide and correlated; with this the calcareous otoconia are\r\nreplaced by sand-grains from the exterior. In Dipnoans (_Lepidosiren_\r\nand _Protopterus_) curious outgrowths arise from the ductus\r\nendolymphaticus and come to overlie the roof of the fourth ventricle,\r\nrecalling the somewhat similar condition met with in certain Amphibians.\r\n\r\n  In various Teleosts the swimbladder enters into intimate relations\r\n  with the otocyst. In the simplest condition these relations consist in\r\n  the prolongation forwards of the swimbladder as a blindly ending tube\r\n  on either side, the blind end coming into direct contact either with\r\n  the wall of the otocyst itself or with the fluid surrounding it\r\n  (perilymph) through a gap in the rigid periotic capsule. A wave of\r\n  compression causing a slight inward movement of the swimbladder wall\r\n  will bring about a greatly magnified movement of that part of the wall\r\n  which is not in relation with the external medium, viz. the part in\r\n  relation with the interior of the auditory capsule. In this way the\r\n  perception of delicate sound waves may be rendered much more perfect.\r\n  In the Ostariophysi (Sagemehl), including the _Cyprinidae_, the\r\n  _Siluridae_, the _Characinidae_ and the _Gymnotidae_, a\r\n  physiologically similar connexion between swimbladder and otocyst is\r\n  brought about by the intervention of a chain of auditory ossicles\r\n  (Weberian ossicles) formed by modification of the anterior\r\n  vertebrae.[51]\r\n\r\n_Lateral Line Organs._[52]--Epidermal sense buds are scattered about in\r\nthe ectoderm of fishes. A special arrangement of these in lines along\r\nthe sides of the body and on the head region form the highly\r\ncharacteristic sense organs of the lateral line system. In _Lepidosiren_\r\nthese organs retain their superficial position; in other fishes they\r\nbecome sunk beneath the surface into a groove, which may remain open\r\n(some Selachians), but as a rule becomes closed into a tubular channel\r\nwith openings at intervals. It has been suggested that the function of\r\nthis system of sense organs is connected with the perception of\r\nvibratory disturbances of comparatively large wave length in the\r\nsurrounding medium.\r\n\r\n_Peripheral Nerves._--In the Cyclostomes the dorsal afferent and ventral\r\nefferent nerves are still, as in _Amphioxus_, independent, but in the\r\ngnathostomatous fishes they are, as in the higher vertebrates, combined\r\ntogether into typical spinal nerves.\r\n\r\nAs regards the cranial nerves the chief peculiarities of fishes relate\r\nto (1) the persistence of the branchial clefts and (2) the presence of\r\nan elaborate system of cutaneous sense organs supplied by a group of\r\nnerves (_lateralis_) connected with a centre in the brain which develops\r\nin continuity with that which receives the auditory nerve. These points\r\nmay be exemplified by the arrangements in Selachians (see fig. 31). I.,\r\nII., III., IV. and VI. call for no special remark.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From Bridge, _Cambridge Natural History_, vol. vii.\r\n\"Fishes\" (by permission of Macmillan & Co., Ltd.).

As it passes\r\nthrough the orbit it gives off the long ciliary nerves to the eyeball,\r\nand is connected with the small ciliary ganglion (also connected with\r\nIII.) which in turn gives off the short ciliary nerves to the eyeball.\r\nThe _ophthalmicus superficialis_ (cut short in the figure) branch passes\r\nfrom the root ganglion of V. (Gasserian ganglion), and passes also over\r\nthe orbit to the skin of the snout. It lies close to, or completely\r\nfused with, the corresponding branch of the lateralis system.\r\n\r\nThe main trunk of V. branches over the edge of the mouth into the\r\n_maxillary_ (mx.) and _mandibular_ (md.) divisions, the former, like the\r\ntwo branches already mentioned, purely sensory, the latter\r\nmixed--supplying the muscles of mastication as well as the teeth of the\r\nlower jaw and the lining of the buccal floor.\r\n\r\nThe main trunk of the _Facialis_ (VII.) bifurcates over the spiracle\r\ninto a pre-spiracular portion--the main portion of which passes to the\r\nmucous membrane of the palate as the palatine (pnVII.)--and a\r\npostspiracular portion, the hyomandibular (hy.) trunk which supplies the\r\nmuscles of the hyoid arch and also sends a few sensory fibres to the\r\nlining of the spiracle, the floor of mouth and pharynx and the skin of\r\nthe lower jaw. Combined with the main trunk of the facial are branches\r\nbelonging to the _lateralis_ system.\r\n\r\n_Lateralis Group of Nerves._--The _lateralis_ group of nerves are\r\ncharged with the innervation of the system of cutaneous sense organs and\r\nare all connected with the same central region in the medulla. A special\r\nsensory area of the ectoderm becomes involuted below the surface to form\r\nthe otocyst, and the nerve fibres belonging to this form the auditory\r\nnerve (VIII.). Other portions of the _lateralis_ group become mixed up\r\nwith various other cranial nerves as follows:\r\n\r\n(a) Facial portion.\r\n\r\n(1) _Ophthalmicus superficialis_ (op.s.VII.): passes to lining of nose\r\nor to the lateral line organs of the dorsal part of snout.\r\n\r\n(2) _Buccal_ (bucc.VII): lies close to maxillary division of V. and\r\npasses to the sensory canals of the lower side of the snout.\r\n\r\n(3) _External mandibular_ (md.ex.): lies in close association with the\r\nmandibular division of V., supplies the sensory canals of the lower jaw\r\nand hyoid region.\r\n\r\n_Lateralis vagi_ (l.n.X.) becomes closely associated with the vagus. It\r\nsupplies the lateral line organs of the trunk.\r\n\r\nIn the lamprey and in Dipnoans the _lateralis vagi_ loses its\r\nsuperficial position in the adult and comes into close relation with the\r\nnotochord.\r\n\r\nIn Actinopterygians and at least some Selachians a _lateralis_ set of\r\nfibres is associated with IX., and in the former fishes a conspicuous\r\ntrunk of _lateralis_ fibres passes to some or all (_Gadus_) of the fins.\r\nThis has been called the _lateralis accessorius_ and is apparently\r\nconnected with V., VII., IX., X. and certain spinal nerves.[53]\r\n\r\n_Vagus Group_ (IX., X., XI.).--The _glossopharyngeus_ (IX.) forks over\r\nthe first branchial cleft (pretrematic and post-trematic branches) and\r\nalso gives off a palatine branch (pn.IX.). In some cases (various\r\nSelachians, Ganoids and Teleosts) it would seem that IX. includes a few\r\nfibres of the _lateralis_ group.\r\n\r\nVagus (X.) is shown by its multiple roots arising from the medulla and\r\nalso by the character of its peripheral distribution to be a compound\r\nstructure formed by the fusion of a number of originally distinct\r\nnerves. It consists of (1) a number of branchial branches (X.¹ X.² &c.),\r\none of which forks over each gill cleft behind the hyobranchial and\r\nwhich may (Selachians) arise by separate roots from the medulla; (2) an\r\nintestinal branch (v.n.X.) arising behind the last branchial and\r\ninnervating the wall of the oesophagus and stomach and it may be even\r\nthe intestine throughout the greater part of its length (_Myxine_).\r\n\r\nThe _accessorius_ (XI.) is not in fishes separated as a distinct nerve\r\nfrom the vagus.\r\n\r\nWith increased development of the brain its hinder portion, giving rise\r\nto the vagus system, has apparently come to encroach on the anterior\r\nportion of the spinal cord, with the result that a number of spinal\r\nnerves have become reduced to a less or more vestigial condition. The\r\ndorsal roots of these nerves disappear entirely in the adult, but the\r\nventral roots persist and are to be seen arising ventrally to the vagus\r\nroots. They supply certain muscles of the pectoral fins and of the\r\nvisceral arches and are known as spino-occipital nerves.[54]\r\n\r\n  These nerves are divisible into an anterior more ancient set--the\r\n  occipital nerves--and a posterior set of more recent\r\n  origin--(occipito-spinal nerves). In Selachians 1-5 pairs of occipital\r\n  nerves alone are recognizable: in Dipnoans 2-3 pairs of occipital and\r\n  2-3 pairs of occipito-spinal: in Ganoids 1-2 pairs occipital and 1-5\r\n  pairs occipito-spinal; in Teleosts finally the occipital nerves have\r\n  entirely disappeared while there are 2 pairs of occipito-spinal. In\r\n  Cyclostomes no special spino-occipital nerves have been described.\r\n\r\nThe fibres corresponding with those of the _Hypoglossus_ (XII.) of\r\nhigher vertebrates spring from the anterior spinal nerves, which are\r\nhere, as indeed in Amphibia, still free from the cranium.\r\n\r\n_Sympathetic._--The sympathetic portion of the nervous system does not\r\nin fishes attain the same degree of differentiation as in the higher\r\ngroups. In Cyclostomes it is apparently represented by a fine plexus\r\nwith small ganglia found in the neighbourhood of the dorsal aorta and on\r\nthe surface of the heart and receiving branches from the spinal nerves.\r\nIn Selachians also a plexus occurs in the neighbourhood of the cardinal\r\nveins and extends over the viscera: it receives visceral branches from\r\nthe anterior spinal nerves. In Teleosts the plexus has become condensed\r\nto form a definite sympathetic trunk on each side, extending forwards\r\ninto the head and communicating with the ganglia of certain of the\r\ncranial nerves.     (J. G. K.)\r\n\r\n\r\nV. DISTRIBUTION IN TIME AND SPACE\r\n\r\nThe origin of Vertebrates, and how far back in time they extend, is\r\nunknown. The earliest fishes were in all probability devoid of hard\r\nparts and traces of their existence can scarcely be expected to be\r\nfound. The hypothesis that they may be derived from the early\r\nCrustaceans, or Arachnids, is chiefly based on the somewhat striking\r\nresemblance which the mailed fishes of the Silurian period\r\n(Ostracodermi) bear to the Arthropods of that remote time, a\r\nresemblance, however, very superficial and regarded by most\r\nmorphologists as an interesting example of mimetic resemblance--whatever\r\nthis term may be taken to mean. The minute denticles known as conodonts,\r\nwhich first appear in the Ordovician, were once looked upon as teeth of\r\nCyclostomes, but their histological structure does not afford any\r\nsupport to the identification and they are now generally dismissed\r\naltogether from the Vertebrates. As a compensation the Lower Silurian of\r\nRussia has yielded small teeth or spines which seem to have really\r\nbelonged to fishes, although their exact affinities are not known\r\n(_Palaeodus_ and _Archodus_ of J. V. Rohon).\r\n\r\nIt is not until we reach the Upper Silurian that satisfactory remains of\r\nunquestionable fishes are found, and here they suddenly appear in a\r\nconsiderable variety of forms, very unlike modern fishes in every\r\nrespect, but so highly developed as to convince us that we have to\r\nsearch in much earlier formations for their ancestors. These Upper\r\nSilurian fishes are the _Coelolepidae_, the _Ateleaspidae_, the\r\n_Birkeniidae_, the _Pteraspidae_, the _Tremataspidae_ and the\r\n_Cephalaspidae_, all referred to the Ostracophori. The three last types\r\npersist in the Devonian, in the middle of which period the Osteolepid\r\nCrossopterygii, the Dipneusti and the Arthrodira suddenly appear. The\r\nmost primitive Selachian (_Cladoselache_), the Acanthodian Selachians\r\n(_Diplacanthidae_), the Chimaerids (_Ptyctodus_), and the Palaeoniscid\r\nganoids (_Chirolepis_) appear in the Upper Devonian, along with the\r\nproblematic _Palaeospondylus_.\r\n\r\nIn the Carboniferous period, the Ostracophori and Arthrodira have\r\ndisappeared, the Crossopterygii and Dipneusti are still abundant, and\r\nthe Selachians (_Pleuracanthus_, Acanthodians, truesharks) and\r\nChondrostean ganoids (_Palaeoniscidae_ and _Platysomidae_) are\r\npredominant. In the Upper Permian the Holostean ganoids\r\n(_Acanthophorus_) make their appearance, and the group becomes dominant\r\nin the Jurassic and the Lower Cretaceous. In the Trias, the\r\nCrossopterygii and Dipneusti dwindle in variety and the _Ceratodontidae_\r\nappear; the Chondrostean and Holostean ganoids are about equally\r\nrepresented, and are supplemented in the Jurassic by the first,\r\nannectant representatives of the Teleostei (_Pholidophoridae_,\r\n_Leptolepidae_). In the latter period, the Holostean ganoids are\r\npredominant, and with them we find numerous Cestraciont sharks, some\r\nprimitive skates (_Squatinidae_ and _Rhinobatidae_), Chimaerids and\r\nnumerous Coelacanthid crossopterygians.\r\n\r\nThe fish-fauna of the Lower Cretaceous is similar to that of the\r\nJurassic, whilst that of the Chalk and other Upper Cretaceous formations\r\nis quite modern in aspect, with only a slight admixture of Coelacanthid\r\ncrossopterygians and Holostean ganoids, the Teleosteans being abundantly\r\nrepresented by _Elopidae_, _Albulidae_, _Halosauridae_, _Scopelidae_ and\r\n_Berycidae_, many being close allies of the present inhabitants of the\r\ndeep sea. At this period the spiny-rayed Teleosteans, dominant in the\r\nseas of the present day, made their first appearance.\r\n\r\nWith the Eocene, the fish-fauna has assumed the essential character\r\nwhich it now bears. A few Pycnodonts survive as the last representatives\r\nof typically Mesozoic ganoids, whilst in the marine deposits of Monte\r\nBolca (Upper Eocene) the principal families of living marine fishes are\r\nrepresented by genera identical with or more or less closely allied to\r\nthose still existing; it is highly remarkable that forms so highly\r\nspecialized as the sucking-fish or remoras, the flat-fish\r\n(_Pleuronectidae_), the Pediculati, the Plectognaths, &c., were in\r\nexistence, whilst in the freshwater deposits of North America\r\n_Osteoglossidae_ and _Cichlidae_ were already represented. Very little\r\nis known of the freshwater fishes of the early Tertiaries. What has been\r\npreserved of them from the Oligocene and Miocene shows that they\r\ndiffered very slightly from their modern representatives. We may\r\nconclude that from early Tertiary times fishes were practically as they\r\nare at present. The great hiatus in our knowledge lies in the period\r\nbetween the Cretaceous and the Eocene.\r\n\r\nAt the present day the Teleosteans are in immense preponderance,\r\nSelachians are still well represented, the Chondrostean ganoids are\r\nconfined to the rivers and lakes of the temperate zone of the northern\r\nhemisphere (_Acipenseridae_, _Polyodontidae_), the Holostean ganoids are\r\nreduced to a few species (_Lepidosteus_, _Amia_) dwelling in the fresh\r\nwaters of North America, Mexico and Cuba, the Crossopterygians are\r\nrepresented by the isolated group _Polypteridae_, widely different from\r\nany of the known fossil forms, with about ten species inhabiting the\r\nrivers and lakes of Africa, whilst the Dipneusti linger in Australia\r\n(_Neoceratodus_), in South America (_Lepidosiren_), and in tropical\r\nAfrica (_Protopterus_). The imperfections of the geological record\r\npreclude any attempt to deal with the distribution in space as regards\r\nextinct forms, but several types, at present very restricted in their\r\nhabitat, once had a very wide distribution. The _Ceratodontidae_, for\r\ninstance, of which only one species is now living, confined to the\r\nrivers of Queensland, has left remains in Triassic, Rhaetic, Jurassic\r\nand Cretaceous rocks of Europe, North America, Patagonia, North and\r\nSouth Africa, India and Australia; the _Amiidae_ and _Lepidosteidae_\r\nwere abundant in Europe in Eocene and Miocene times; the\r\n_Osteoglossidae_, now living in Africa, S.E. Asia and South America,\r\noccurred in North America and Europe in the Eocene.\r\n\r\nIn treating of the geographical distribution of modern fishes, it is\r\nnecessary to distinguish between fresh-water and marine forms. It is,\r\nhowever, not easy to draw a line between these categories, as a large\r\nnumber of forms are able to accommodate themselves to either fresh or\r\nsalt water, whilst some periodically migrate from the one into the\r\nother. On the whole, fishes may be roughly divided into the following\r\ncategories:--\r\n\r\n  I. Marine fishes. A. shore-fishes; B. pelagic fishes; C. deep-sea\r\n  fishes.\r\n\r\n  II. Brackish-water fishes.\r\n\r\n  III. Fresh-water fishes.\r\n\r\n  IV. Migratory fishes. A. anadromous (ascending fresh waters to spawn);\r\n  B. catadromous (descending to the sea to spawn).\r\n\r\nAbout two-thirds of the known recent fishes are marine. Such are nearly\r\nall the Selachians, and, among the Teleosteans, all the _Heteromi_,\r\n_Pediculati_ and the great majority of _Apodes_, _Thoracostei_,\r\n_Percesoces_, _Anacanthini_, _Acanthopterygii_ and _Plectognathi_. All\r\nthe _Crossopterygii_, _Dipneusti_, _Opisthomi_, _Symbranchii_, and\r\nnearly all the _Ganoidei_ and _Ostariophysi_ are confined to\r\nfresh-water.\r\n\r\nThe three categories of marine fishes have thus been defined by\r\nGünther:--\r\n\r\n  \"1. _Shore Fishes_--that is, fishes which chiefly inhabit parts of the\r\n  sea in the immediate neighbourhood of land either actually raised\r\n  above, or at least but little submerged below, the surface of the\r\n  water. They do not descend to any great depth,--very few to 300\r\n  fathoms, and the majority live close to the surface. The distribution\r\n  of these fishes is determined, not only by the temperature of the\r\n  surface water, but also by the nature of the adjacent land and its\r\n  animal and vegetable products,--some being confined to flat coasts\r\n  with soft or sandy bottoms, others to rocky and fissured coasts,\r\n  others to living coral formations. If it were not for the frequent\r\n  mechanical and involuntary removals to which these fishes are exposed,\r\n  their distribution within certain limits, as it no doubt originally\r\n  existed, would resemble still more that of freshwater fishes than we\r\n  find it actually does at the present period.\r\n\r\n  2. _Pelagic Fishes_--that is, fishes which inhabit the surface and\r\n  uppermost strata of the open ocean, and approach the shores only\r\n  accidentally or occasionally (in search of prey), or periodically (for\r\n  the purpose of spawning). The majority spawn in the open sea, their\r\n  ova and young being always found at a great distance from the shore.\r\n  With regard to their distribution, they are still subject to the\r\n  influences of light and the temperature of the surface water; but they\r\n  are independent of the variable local conditions which tie the shore\r\n  fish to its original home, and therefore roam freely over a space\r\n  which would take a freshwater or shore fish thousands of years to\r\n  cover in its gradual dispersal. Such as are devoid of rapidity of\r\n  motion are dispersed over similarly large areas by the oceanic\r\n  currents, more slowly than the strong swimmers, but not less surely.\r\n  An accurate definition, therefore, of their distribution within\r\n  certain areas equivalent to the terrestrial regions is much less\r\n  feasible than in the case of shore fishes.\r\n\r\n  3. _Deep-Sea Fishes_--that is, fishes which inhabit such depths of the\r\n  ocean that they are but little or not at all influenced by light or\r\n  the surface temperature, and which, by their organization, are\r\n  prevented from reaching the surface stratum in a healthy condition.\r\n  Living almost under identical tellurian conditions, the same type, the\r\n  same species, may inhabit an abyssal depth under the equator as well\r\n  as one near the arctic or antarctic circle; and all that we know of\r\n  these fishes points to the conclusion that no separate horizontal\r\n  regions can be distinguished in the abyssal fauna, and that no\r\n  division into bathymetrical strata can be attempted on the base of\r\n  generic much less of family characters.\"\r\n\r\nA division of the world into regions according to the distribution of\r\nthe shore-fishes is a much more difficult task than that of tracing\r\ncontinental areas. It is possible perhaps to distinguish four great\r\ndivisions: the Arctic region, the Atlantic region, the Indo-Pacific\r\nregion and the Antarctic region. The second and third may be again\r\nsubdivided into three zones: Northern, Tropical and Southern. This\r\nappears to be a more satisfactory arrangement than that which has been\r\nproposed into three zones primarily, each again subdivided according to\r\nthe different oceans. Perhaps a better division is that adopted by D. S.\r\nJordan, who arranges the littoral fishes according to coast lines; we\r\nthen have an East Atlantic area, a West Atlantic, an East Pacific and a\r\nWest Pacific, the latter including the coasts of the Indian Ocean. The\r\ntropical zone, whatever be the ocean, is that in which fishes flourish\r\nin greatest abundance and where, especially about coral-reefs, they show\r\nthe greatest variety of bizarre forms and the most gorgeous coloration.\r\nThe fish-fauna of the Indo-Pacific is much richer than that of the\r\nAtlantic, both as regards genera and species.\r\n\r\nAs regards the Arctic and Antarctic regions, the continuity or\r\ncircumpolar distribution of the shore fishes is well established. The\r\nformer is chiefly characterized by its Cottids, Cyclopterids, Zoarcids\r\nand Gadids, the latter by its Nototheniids. The theory of bipolarity\r\nreceives no support from the study of the fishes.\r\n\r\nPelagic fishes, among which we find the largest Selachians and\r\nTeleosteans, are far less limited in their distribution, which, for many\r\nspecies, is nearly world-wide. Some are dependent upon currents, but the\r\ngreat majority being rapid swimmers able to continue their course for\r\nweeks, apparently without the necessity of rest (many sharks, scombrids,\r\nsword-fishes), pass from one ocean into the other. Most numerous between\r\nthe tropics, many of these fishes occasionally wander far north and\r\nsouth of their habitual range, and there are few genera that are at all\r\nlimited in their distribution.\r\n\r\nDeep-sea fishes, of which between seven hundred and eight hundred\r\nspecies are known, belong to the most diverse groups and quite a number\r\nof families are exclusively bathybial (_Chlamydoselachidae_,\r\n_Stomiatidae_, _Alepocephalidae_, _Nemichthyidae_, _Synaphobranchidae_,\r\n_Saccopharyngidae_, _Cetomimidae_, _Halosauridae_, _Lipogenyidae_,\r\n_Notacanthidae_, _Chiasmodontidae_, _Icosteidae_, _Muraenolepididae_,\r\n_Macruridae_, _Anomalopidae_, _Podatelidae_, _Trachypteridae_,\r\n_Lophotidae_, _Ceratiidae_, _Gigantactinidae_). But they are all\r\ncomparatively slight modifications of the forms living on the surface of\r\nthe sea or in the shallow parts, from which they may be regarded as\r\nderived. In no instance do these types show a structure which may be\r\ntermed archaic when compared with their surface allies. That these\r\nfishes are localized in their vertical distribution, between the\r\n100-fathoms line, often taken as the arbitrary limit of the bathybial\r\nfauna, and the depth of 2750 fathoms, the lowest point whence fishes\r\nhave been procured, there is little doubt. But our knowledge is still\r\ntoo fragmentary to allow of any general conclusions, and the same\r\napplies to the horizontal distribution. Yet the same species may occur\r\nat most distant points; as these fishes dwell beyond the influence of\r\nthe sun's rays, they are not affected by temperature, and living in the\r\nArctic zone or under the equator makes little difference to them. A\r\ngreat deal of evidence has been accumulated to show the gradual\r\ntransition of the surface into the bathybial forms; a large number of\r\nsurface fishes have been met with in deep water (from 100 to 500\r\nfathoms), and these animals afford no support to Alexander Agassiz's\r\nsupposition of the existence of an azoic zone between the 200-fathoms\r\nline and the bottom.\r\n\r\nBrackish-water fishes occur also in salt and fresh water, in some\r\nlocalities at least, and belong to various groups of Teleosteans.\r\nSticklebacks, gobies, grey mullets, blennies are among the best-known\r\nexamples. The facility with which they accommodate themselves to changes\r\nin the medium in which they live has enabled them to spread readily over\r\nvery large areas. The three-spined stickleback, for instance, occurs\r\nover nearly the whole of the cold and temperate parts of the northern\r\nhemisphere, whilst a grey mullet (_Mugil capito_) ranges without any\r\nappreciable difference in form from Scandinavia and the United States\r\nalong all the Atlantic coasts to the Cape of Good Hope and Brazil. It\r\nwould be hardly possible to base zoo-geographical divisions on the\r\ndistribution of such forms.\r\n\r\nThe fresh-water fishes, however, invite to such attempts. How greatly\r\ntheir distribution differs from that of terrestrial animals has long ago\r\nbeen emphasized. The key to their mode of dispersal is, with few\r\nexceptions, to be found in the hydrography of the continents, latitude\r\nand climate, excepting of course very great altitudes, being\r\ninconsiderable factors, the fish-fauna of a country deriving its\r\ncharacter from the headwaters of the river-system which flows through\r\nit. The lower Nile, for instance, is inhabited by fishes bearing a close\r\nresemblance to, or even specifically identical with, those of tropical\r\nAfrica, thus strikingly contrasting with the land-fauna of its banks.\r\nThe knowledge of the river-systems is, however, not sufficient for\r\ntracing areas of distribution, for we must bear in mind the movements\r\nwhich have taken place on the surface of the earth, owing to which\r\npresent conditions may not have existed within comparatively recent\r\ntimes, geologically speaking; and this is where the systematic study of\r\nthe aquatic animals affords scope for conclusions having a direct\r\nbearing on the physical geography of the near past. It is not possible\r\nhere to enter into the discussion of the many problems which the\r\ndistribution of fresh-water fishes involves; we limit ourselves to an\r\nindication of the principal regions into which the world may be divided\r\nfrom this point of view. The main divisions proposed by Günther in the\r\n9th edition of the _Encyclopædia Britannica_ still appear the most\r\nsatisfactory. They are as follows:--\r\n\r\n  I. THE NORTHERN ZONE OR HOLARCTIC REGION.--Characterized\r\n  by Acipenseridae. Few Siluridae. Numerous Cyprinidae, Salmonidae,\r\n  Esocidae, Percidae.\r\n    1. Europaeo-Asiatic or Palaearctic Region. Characterized by\r\n        absence of osseous Ganoidei; Cobitinae and Barbus numerous.\r\n    2. North American or Nearctic Region. Characterized by osseous\r\n        Ganoidei and abundance of Catostominae; but no Cobitinae or\r\n        Barbus.\r\n\r\n  II. THE EQUATORIAL ZONE.--Characterized by the development\r\n  of Siluridae.\r\n    A. Cyprinoid Division. Characterized by presence of Cyprinidae,\r\n        Mastacembelidae. Anabantidae, Ophiocephalidae.\r\n          1. Indian Region. Characterized by absence of Dipneusti,\r\n               Polypteridae, Mormyridae and Characinidae. Cobitinae\r\n               numerous.\r\n          2. African Region. Characterized by presence of Dipneusti,\r\n               Polypterid and Mormyrid; Cichlid and Characinid numerous.\r\n\r\n  B. Acyprinoid Division. Characterized by absence of Cyprinidae and the\r\n       other families mentioned above.\r\n        1. Tropical American or Neotropical Region. Characterized by\r\n             presence of Dipneusti; Cichlidae and Characinidae numerous;\r\n             Gymnotidae and Loricariidae.\r\n        2. Tropical Pacific Region. Includes the Australian as  well as\r\n             the Polynesian Region. Characterized by presence of\r\n             Dipneusti. Cichlidae and Characinidae absent.\r\n\r\n  III. THE SOUTHERN ZONE.--Characterized by absence of Cyprinidae and\r\n  scarcity of Siluridae. Haplochitonidae and Galaxiidae represent the\r\n  Salmonids and Esoces of the northern zone. One region only.\r\n\r\n  1. Antarctic Region. Characterized by the small number of species; the\r\n       fishes of\r\n        (a) The Tasmanian subregion;\r\n        (b) The New Zealand subregion; and\r\n        (c) The Patagonian or Fuegian subregion being almost identical.\r\n\r\nAlthough, as expressed in the above synopsis, the resemblance between\r\nthe Indian and African regions is far greater than exists between them\r\nand the other regions of the equatorial zone, attention must be drawn to\r\nthe marked affinity which some of the fishes of tropical Africa show to\r\nthose of South America (_Lepidosirenidae_, _Characinidae_, _Cichlidae_,\r\n_Nandidae_), an affinity which favours the supposition of a connexion\r\nbetween these two parts of the world in early Tertiary times.\r\n\r\nThe boundaries of Günther's regions may thus be traced, beginning with\r\nthe equatorial zone, this being the richest.\r\n\r\nEQUATORIAL ZONE.--Roughly speaking, the borders of this zoological zone\r\ncoincide with the geographical limits of the tropics of Cancer and\r\nCapricorn; its characteristic forms, however, extend in undulating lines\r\nseveral degrees both northwards and southwards. Commencing from the west\r\ncoast of Africa, the desert of the Sahara forms a boundary between the\r\nequatorial and northern zones; as the boundary approaches the Nile, it\r\nmakes a sudden sweep towards the north as far as northern Syria, crosses\r\nthrough Persia and Afghanistan to the southern ranges of the Himalayas,\r\nand follows the course of the Yang-tse-Kiang, which receives its\r\ncontingent of equatorial fishes through its southern tributaries. Its\r\ncontinuation through the North Pacific may be indicated by the tropic,\r\nwhich strikes the coast of Mexico at the southern end of the Gulf of\r\nCalifornia. Equatorial types of South America are known to extend so far\r\nnorthwards; and, by following the same line, the West India Islands are\r\nnaturally included in this zone.\r\n\r\nTowards the south the equatorial zone embraces the whole of Africa and\r\nMadagascar, and seems to extend still farther south in Australia, its\r\nboundary probably following the southern coast of that continent; the\r\ndetailed distribution of the freshwater fishes of south-western\r\nAustralia has been little studied, but the tropical fishes of that\r\nregion follow the principal watercourse, the Murray river, far towards\r\nthe south and probably to its mouth. The boundary-line then stretches to\r\nthe north of Tasmania and New Zealand, coinciding with the tropic until\r\nit strikes the western slope of the Andes, on the South American\r\ncontinent, where it again bends southward to embrace the system of the\r\nRio de la Plata.\r\n\r\nThe four regions into which the equatorial zone is divided arrange\r\nthemselves into two well-marked divisions, one of which is characterized\r\nby the presence of Cyprinid fishes, combined with the development of\r\n_Labyrinthic_ Percesoces (_Anabantidae_ and _Ophiocephalidae_) and\r\nMastacembelids, whilst in the other these types are absent. The boundary\r\nbetween the Cyprinoid and Acyprinoid division seems to follow the now\r\nexploded Wallace's line--a line drawn from the south of the Philippines\r\nbetween Borneo and Celebes, and farther south between Bali and Lombok.\r\nBorneo abounds in Cyprinids; from the Philippine Islands a few only are\r\nknown, and in Bali two species have been found; but none are known from\r\nCelebes or Lombok, or from islands situated farther east.\r\n\r\nThe Indian region comprises Asia south of the Himalayas and the\r\nYang-tse-Kiang, and includes the islands to the west of Celebes and\r\nLombok. Towards the north-east the island of Formosa, which also by\r\nother parts of its fauna shows the characters of the equatorial zone,\r\nhas received some characteristic Japanese freshwater fishes. Within the\r\ngeographical boundaries of China the freshwater fishes of the tropics\r\npass gradually into those of the northern zone, both being separated by\r\na broad, debateable ground. The affluents of the great river traversing\r\nthis district are more numerous from the south than from the north, and\r\ncarry the southern fishes far into the temperate zone. Scarcely better\r\ndefined is the boundary of this region towards the north-west, in which\r\nfishes were very poorly represented by types common to India and Africa.\r\n\r\nThe African region comprises the whole of Africa south of the Sahara. It\r\nmight have been conjectured that the more temperate climate of its\r\nsouthern extremity would have been accompanied by a conspicuous\r\ndifference in the fish fauna. But this is not the case; the difference\r\nbetween the tropical and southern parts of Africa consists simply in the\r\ngradual disappearance of specifically tropical forms, whilst Silurids,\r\nCyprinids and even _Anabas_ penetrate to its southern coast; no new\r\nform, except a _Galaxias_ at the Cape of Good Hope, has entered to\r\nimpart to South Africa a character distinct from the central portion of\r\nthe continent. In the north-east the African fauna passes the isthmus of\r\nSuez and penetrates into Syria; the system of the Jordan presents so\r\nmany African types that it has to be included in a description of the\r\nAfrican region as well as of the Europaeo-Asiatic.\r\n\r\nThe boundaries of the Neotropical or Tropical American region have been\r\nsufficiently indicated in the definition of the equatorial zone. A broad\r\nand most irregular band of country, in which the South and North\r\nAmerican forms are mixed, exists in the north.\r\n\r\nThe Tropical Pacific region includes all the islands east of Wallace's\r\nline, New Guinea, Australia (with the exception of its south-eastern\r\nportion), and all the islands of the tropical Pacific to the Sandwich\r\ngroup.\r\n\r\nNORTHERN ZONE.--The boundaries of the northern zone coincide in the main\r\nwith the northern limit of the equatorial zone; but they overlap the\r\nlatter at different points. This happens in Syria, as well as east of\r\nit, where the mixed faunae of the Jordan and the rivers of Mesopotamia\r\ndemand the inclusion of this territory in the northern zone as well as\r\nin the equatorial; in the island of Formosa, where a Salmonid and\r\nseveral Japanese Cyprinids flourish; and in Central America, where a\r\n_Lepidosteus_, a Cyprinid (_Sclerognathus meridionalis_), and an\r\n_Amiurus_ (_A. meridionalis_) represent the North American fauna in the\r\nmidst of a host of tropical forms.\r\n\r\nThere is no separate arctic zone for freshwater fishes; ichthyic life\r\nbecomes extinct towards the pole wherever the fresh water remains frozen\r\nthroughout the year, or thaws for a few weeks only; and the few fishes\r\nwhich extend into high latitudes belong to types in no wise differing\r\nfrom those of the more temperate south. The highest latitude at which\r\nfishes have been obtained is 82° N. lat., whence specimens of char\r\n(_Salmo arcturus_ and _Salmo naresii_) have been brought back.\r\n\r\n_The Palaearctic or Europaeo-Asiatic Region._--The western and southern\r\nboundaries of this region coincide with those of the northern zone.\r\nBering Strait and the Kamchatka Sea have been conventionally taken as\r\nthe boundary in the north, but the fishes of both coasts, so far as they\r\nare known, are not sufficiently distinct to be referred to two different\r\nregions. The Japanese islands exhibit a decided Palaearctic fish fauna\r\nwith a slight influx of tropical forms in the south. In the east, as\r\nwell as in the west, the distinction between the Europaeo-Asiatic and\r\nthe North American regions disappears almost entirely as we advance\r\nfarther towards the north. Finally, the Europaeo-Asiatic fauna mingles\r\nwith African and Indian forms in Syria, Persia and Afghanistan.\r\n\r\nThe boundaries of the North American or Nearctic region have been\r\nsufficiently indicated. The main features and the distribution of this\r\nfauna are identical with those of the preceding region.\r\n\r\nSOUTHERN ZONE.--The boundaries of this zone have been indicated in the\r\ndescription of the equatorial zone; they overlap the southern\r\nboundaries of the latter in South Australia and South America, but we\r\nhave not the means of defining the limits to which southern types extend\r\nnorthwards. This zone includes Tasmania, with at least a portion of\r\nsouth-eastern Australia (Tasmanian sub-region), New Zealand and the\r\nAuckland Islands (New Zealand sub-region), and Chile, Patagonia, Tierra\r\ndel Fuego and the Falkland Islands (Fuegian sub-region). No freshwater\r\nfishes are known from Kerguelen's Land, or from islands beyond 55° S.\r\nlat.\r\n\r\nThe Tropical American region is the richest (about 1300 species); next\r\nfollow the African region (about 1000), the Indian region (about 800),\r\nthe Europaeo-Asiatic region (about 500), the North American region\r\n(about 400), the Tropical Pacific region (about 60); whilst the\r\nAntarctic region is quite insignificant.\r\n\r\nOf the migratory fishes, or fishes travelling regularly from the sea to\r\nfresh waters, most, if not all, were derived from marine forms. The\r\nanadromous forms, annually or periodically ascending rivers for the\r\npurpose of spawning, such as several species of _Acipenser_, _Salmo_,\r\n_Coregonus_, _Clupea_ (shads), and _Petromyzon_, are only known from the\r\nnorthern hemisphere, whilst the catadromous forms, spending most of\r\ntheir life in fresh water but resorting to the sea to breed, such as\r\n_Anguilla_, some species of _Mugil_, _Galaxias_ and _Pleuronectes_, have\r\nrepresentatives in both hemispheres.

Nearchus mentions such a race as\r\ninhabiting the barren shores of the Mekran on the Arabian Sea; Pausanias\r\nlocates them on the western coast of the Red Sea. Ptolemy speaks of\r\nfish-eaters in Ethiopia, and on the west coast of Africa; while Pliny\r\nrelates the existence of such tribes on the islands in the Persian Gulf.\r\nHerodotus (book i. c. 200) mentions three tribes of the Babylonians who\r\nwere solely fish-eaters, and in book iii. c. 19 refers to Ichthyophagi\r\nin Egypt. The existence of such tribes was confirmed by Sir Richard F.\r\nBurton (_El-Medinah_, p. 144).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nICHTHYOSAURUS, a fish or porpoise-shaped marine reptile which\r\ncharacterized the Mesozoic period and became extinct immediately after\r\nthe deposition of the Chalk. It was named _Ichthyosaurus_ (Gr.\r\nfish-lizard) by C. König in 1818 in allusion to its outward form, and is\r\nbest known by nearly complete skeletons from the Lias of England and\r\nGermany. The large head is produced into a slender, pointed snout; and\r\nthe jaws are provided with a row of conical teeth nearly uniform in size\r\nand deeply implanted in a continuous groove. The eye is enormous, and is\r\nsurrounded by a ring of overlapping \"sclerotic plates,\" which would\r\nserve to protect the eye-ball during diving. The vertebrae are very\r\nnumerous, short and deeply biconcave, imparting great flexibility to the\r\nbackbone as in fishes. The neck is so short and thick that it is\r\npractically absent. There are always two pairs of paddle-like limbs, the\r\nhinder pair never disappearing as in porpoises and other Cetacea, though\r\noften much reduced in size. A few specimens from the Upper Lias of\r\nWürttemberg (in the museums of Stuttgart, Tübingen, Budapest and\r\nChicago) exhibit remains of the skin, which is quite smooth and forms\r\ntwo triangular median fins, one in the middle of the back, the other at\r\nthe end of the tail. The dorsal fin consists merely of skin without any\r\ninternal skeleton, while the tail-fin is expanded in a vertical plane\r\nand has the lower lobe stiffened by the tapering end of the backbone,\r\nwhich is sharply bent downwards. Immature individuals are sometimes\r\nobservable within the full-grown skeletons, suggesting that this reptile\r\nwas viviparous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From British Museum _Guide to Fossil Reptiles and\r\nFishes_, by permission of the Trustees.\r\n\r\nSkeleton of _Ichthyosaurus communis_, with outline of body and fins,\r\nfrom the Lower Lias of Lyme Regis, Dorset; original nearly four metres\r\nin length.]\r\n\r\nThe largest known species of _Ichthyosaurus_ is _I. trigonodon_ from the\r\nUpper Lias of Banz, Bavaria, with the head measuring about two metres in\r\nlength and probably representing an animal not less than ten metres in\r\ntotal length. _I. platyodon_, from the English Lower Lias, seems to have\r\nbeen almost equally large. _I. intermedius_ and _I. communis_, which are\r\nthe commonest species in the English Lower Lias, rarely exceed a length\r\nof three or four metres. The species in rocks later than the Lias are\r\nknown for the most part only by fragments, but the remains of Lower\r\nCretaceous age are noteworthy for their very wide geographical\r\ndistribution, having been found in Europe, the East Indies, Australia,\r\nNew Zealand and South America. Allied Ichthyosaurians named\r\n_Ophthalmosaurus_ and _Baptanodon_, from the Upper Jurassic of England\r\nand North America, are nearly or quite toothless and have very flexible\r\nbroad paddles. The earliest known Ichthyosaurians (_Mixosaurus_), which\r\noccur in the Trias, are of diminutive size, with paddles which suggest\r\nthat these marine reptiles were originally descended from land or marsh\r\nanimals (see REPTILES).\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--R.

This disease generally first appears in infancy, and is\r\nprobably congenital. It differs in intensity and in distribution, and is\r\ngenerally little amenable to any but palliative remedies, such as the\r\nregular application of oily substances. Ichthyosis lingualis (\"smokers'\r\ntongue\"), a variety common in heavy smokers, occurs in opaque white\r\npatches on the tongue, gums and roof of the mouth. Cancer occasionally\r\nstarts from the patches. The affection is obstinate, but may disappear\r\nspontaneously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nICKNIELD STREET. (i) The Saxon name (earlier _Icenhylt_) of a\r\nprehistoric (not Roman) \"Ridgeway\" along the Berkshire downs and the\r\nChilterns, which crossed the Thames near Streatley and ended somewhere\r\nnear Tring or Dunstable. In some places there are traces of a double\r\nroad, one line on the hills and one in the valley below, as if for\r\nsummer and winter use. No modern highroad follows it for any distance.\r\nAntiquaries have supposed that it once ran on to Royston, Newmarket and\r\nNorfolk, and have connected its name with the Iceni, the Celtic tribe\r\ninhabiting East Anglia before the Roman conquest. But the name does not\r\noccur in early documents so far east, and it has certainly nothing to do\r\nwith that of the Iceni (Haverfield, _Victoria History of Norfolk_, i.\r\n286). See further ERMINE STREET. (2) A Roman road which ran through\r\nDerby, Lichfield, Birmingham and Alcester is sometimes called Icknield\r\nStreet and sometimes Rycknield Street. The origin of this nomenclature\r\nis very obscure (_Vict. Hist. of Warwick_, i. 239).     (F. J. H.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nICON (through the Latinized form, from Gr. [Greek: eikôn], portrait,\r\nimage), generally any image or portrait-figure, but specially the term\r\napplied to the representations in the Eastern Church of sacred\r\npersonages, whether in painting or sculpture, and particularly to the\r\nsmall metal plaques in archaic Byzantine style, venerated by the\r\nadherents of the Greek Church. See ICONOCLASTS; IMAGE-WORSHIP; BYZANTINE\r\nART. The term \"iconography,\" once confined to the study of engravings\r\n(q.v.), is now applied to the history of portrait images in Christian\r\nart, though it is also used with a qualifying adjective of Greek, Roman\r\nand other art.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nICONIUM (mod. _Konia_), a city of Asia Minor, the last of the Phrygian\r\nland towards Lycaonia, was commonly reckoned to Lycaonia in the Roman\r\ntime, but retained its old Phrygian connexion and population to a\r\ncomparatively late date. Its natural surroundings must have made it an\r\nimportant town from the beginning of organized society in this region.\r\nIt lies in an excellently fertile plain, 6 m. from the Pisidian\r\nmountains on the west, with mountains more distant on the north and\r\nsouth, while to the east the dead level plain stretches away for\r\nhundreds of miles, though the distant view is interrupted by island-like\r\nmountains. Streams from the Pisidian mountains make the land on the\r\nsouth-west and south of the city a garden; but on the east and\r\nnorth-east a great part of the naturally fertile soil is uncultivated.\r\nTrees grow nowhere except in the gardens near the city. Irrigation is\r\nnecessary for productiveness, and the water-supply is now deficient. A\r\nmuch greater supply was available for agriculture in ancient times and\r\nmight be reintroduced.\r\n\r\nOriginally a Phrygian city, as almost every authority who has come into\r\ncontact with the population calls it, and as is implied in Acts xiv. 6,\r\nit was in a political sense the chief city of the Lycaonian tetrarchy\r\nadded to the Galatian country about 165 B.C., and it was part of the\r\nRoman province Galatia from 25 B.C. to about A.D. 295. Then it was\r\nincluded in the province Pisidia (as Ammianus Marcellinus describes it)\r\ntill 372, after which it formed part of the new province Lycaonia so\r\nlong as the provincial division lasted. Later it was a principal city of\r\nthe theme of Anatolia. It suffered much from the Arab raids in the three\r\ncenturies following A.D. 660; its capture in 708 is mentioned, but it\r\nnever was held as a city of the caliphs. In later Roman and Byzantine\r\ntimes it must have been a large and wealthy city. It was a metropolis\r\nand an archbishopric, and one of the earliest councils of the church was\r\nheld there in A.D. 235. The ecclesiastical organization of Lycaonia and\r\nthe country round Iconium on all sides was complete in the early 4th\r\ncentury, and monuments of later 3rd and 4th century Christianity are\r\nextremely numerous. The history of Christian Iconium is utterly obscure.\r\nThe city was thrice visited by St Paul, probably in A.D. 47, 50 and 53;\r\nand it is the principal scene of the tale of Paul and Thecla (which\r\nthough apocryphal has certainly some historical basis; see THECLA).\r\nThere was a distinct Roman element in Iconium, arising doubtless from\r\nthe presence of Roman traders. This was recognized by Claudius, who\r\ngranted the honorary title Claudiconium, and by Hadrian, who elevated\r\nthe city to the rank of a Roman colony about A.D. 130 under the name\r\nColonia Aelia Hadriana Augusta Iconiensium. The period of its greatest\r\nsplendour was after the conquest by the Seljuk Turks about 1072-1074. It\r\nsoon became the capital of the Seljuk state, and one of the most\r\nbrilliant cities of the world. The palace of the sultans and the mosque\r\nof Ala ed-din Kaikobad formerly covered great part of the Acropolis hill\r\nin the northern part of the city. Farther south there is still the great\r\ncomplex of buildings which form the chief seat of the Mevlevi dervishes,\r\na sect widely spread over Anatolia. Many other splendid mosques and\r\nroyal tombs adorned the city, and justified the Turkish proverb, \"See\r\nall the world; but see Konia.\" The walls, about 2 m. in circumference,\r\nconsisted of a core of rubble and concrete, coated with ancient stones,\r\ninscriptions, sculptures and architectural marbles, forming a striking\r\nsight, which no traveller ever examined in detail. Beyond the walls\r\nextended the gardens and villas of a prosperous Oriental population,\r\nespecially on the south-west towards the suburb of Meram.\r\n\r\nWhen the Seljuk state broke up, and the Osmanli or Ottoman sovereignty\r\narose, Konia decayed, its population dwindled and the splendid early\r\nTurkish buildings were suffered to go to ruin. As trade and intercourse\r\ndiminished Konia grew poorer and more ruinous. The walls and the palace,\r\nstill perfect in the beginning of the 19th century, were gradually\r\npulled down for building material, and in 1882 there remained only a\r\nsmall part of the walls, from which all the outer stones had been\r\nremoved, while the palace was a ruin. At that time and for some years\r\nlater a large part of Konia was like a city of the dead. But about 1895\r\nthe advent of the Anatolian railway began to restore its prosperity. A\r\ngood supply of drinking water was brought to the city by Ferid Pasha,\r\nwho governed the vilayet ably for several years, till in 1903 he was\r\nappointed Grand Vizier. The sacred buildings, mosques, &c., were patched\r\nup (except a few which were quite ruinous) and the walls wholly removed,\r\nbut an unsightly fragment of a palace-tower still remained in 1906. In\r\n1904-1905 the first two sections of the Bagdad railway, 117 m., to\r\nKaraman and Eregli, were built. In the city there is a branch of the\r\nOttoman bank, a government technical school, a French Catholic mission\r\nand a school, an Armenian Protestant school for boys, an American\r\nmission school for girls, mainly Armenian, and other educational\r\nestablishments.\r\n\r\nThe founder of the Mevlevi dancing dervishes, the poet Mahommed\r\nJelal-ed-Din (Rumi), in 1307, though tempted to assume the inheritance\r\nalong with the empire of the Seljuk sultan Ala ed-din Kaikobad III., who\r\ndied without heirs, preferred to pass on the power to Osman, son of\r\nErtogrul, and with his own hands invested Osman and girt him with the\r\nsword: this investiture was the legitimate beginning of the Osmanli\r\nauthority. The heirs of Jelal-ed-Din (Rumi) were favoured by the Osmanli\r\nsultans until 1516, when Selim was on the point of destroying the\r\nMevlevi establishment as hostile to the Osmanli and the faith; and\r\nthough he did not do so the Mevlevi and their chiefs were deprived of\r\ninfluence and dignity. In 1829 Mahmud II. restored their dignity in\r\npart, and in 1889 Abd-ul-Hamid II. confirmed their exemption from\r\nmilitary duty. The head of the Mevlevi dervishes (Aziz-Effendi,\r\nHazreti-Mevlana, Mollah-Unkiar, commonly styled simply Chelebi-Effendi)\r\nhas the right to gird on the sultan's sword at his investiture, and is\r\nmaster of the considerable revenues of the greatest religious\r\nestablishment in the empire. He has also the privilege of corresponding\r\ndirect with the caliph; but otherwise is regarded as rather opposed to\r\nthe Osmanli administration, and has no real power.\r\n\r\nIconium is distant by rail 466 m. from the Bosporus at Haidar-Pasha, and\r\n389 from Smyrna by way of Afium-Kara-Hissar. It has recently become the\r\nseat of a considerable manufacture of carpets, owing to the cheapness of\r\nlabour. The population was estimated at 44,000 in 1890, and is now\r\nprobably over 50,000. Mercury mines have begun to be worked; other\r\nminerals are known to exist.     (W. M. Ra.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nICONOCLASTS (Gr. [Greek: eikonoklastês: eikôn], image, and [Greek:\r\nklaein], to break), the name applied particularly to the opponents in\r\nthe 8th and 9th centuries of the use of images in Christian cult.\r\n\r\nAs regards the attitude towards religious images assumed by the\r\nprimitive Christian Church, several questions have often been treated as\r\none which cannot be too carefully kept apart. There can be no doubt that\r\nthe early Christians were unanimous in condemning heathen image-worship\r\nand the various customs, some immoral, with which it was associated. A\r\nform of iconolatry specially deprecated in the New Testament was the\r\nthen prevalent adoration of the images of the reigning emperors (see\r\nRev. xv. 2). It is also tolerably certain that, if for no other reasons\r\nbesides the Judaism, obscurity, and poverty of the early converts to\r\nChristianity, the works of art seen in their meeting-houses cannot at\r\nfirst have been numerous. Along with these reasons would co-operate\r\ntowards the exclusion of visible aids to devotion, not only the church's\r\nsacramental use of Christ's name as a name of power, and its living\r\nsense of his continued real though unseen presence, but also, during the\r\nfirst years, its constant expectation of his second advent as imminent.\r\nIt was a common accusation brought against Jews and Christians that they\r\nhad \"no altars, no temples, no known images\" (Min. Fel. _Oct._ c. 10),\r\nthat \"they set up no image or form of any god\" (see Arnob. _Adv. Gent._\r\nvi. I; similarly Celsus); and this charge was never denied; on the\r\ncontrary Origen gloried in it (_c. Celsum_, bk. 7, p. 386). At a\r\ncomparatively early date, indeed, we read of various Gnostic sects\r\ncalling in the fine arts to aid their worship; thus Irenaeus (_Haer._ i.\r\n25. 6), speaking of the followers of Marcellina, says that \"they possess\r\nimages, some of them painted, and others formed from different kinds of\r\nmaterial; and they maintain that a likeness of Christ was made by\r\nPilate at that time when Jesus lived among men. They crown these images,\r\nand set them up along with the images of the philosophers of the world;\r\nthat is to say, with the images of Pythagoras and Plato and Aristotle\r\nand the rest. They have also other modes of honouring these images after\r\nthe same manner as the Gentiles\" (cf. Aug. _De Haer._ c. 7). It is also\r\nwell known that the emperor Alexander Severus found a place for several\r\nScripture characters and even for Christ in his lararium (Lamprid. _Vit.\r\nAlex. Sev._ c. 29). But there is no evidence that such a use of images\r\nextended at that period to orthodox Christian circles. The first\r\nunmistakable indication of the public use of the painter's art for\r\ndirectly religious ends does not occur until A.D. 306, when the synod of\r\nElvira, Spain, decreed (can. 36) that \"pictures ought not to be in a\r\nchurch, lest that which is worshipped and adored be painted on\r\nwalls.\"[1] This canon is proof that the use of sacred pictures in public\r\nworship was not at the beginning of the 4th century a thing unknown\r\nwithin the church in Spain; and the presumption is that in other places,\r\nabout the same period, the custom was looked upon with a more tolerant\r\neye. Indications of the existence of allied forms of sacred Christian\r\nart prior to this period are not wholly wanting. It seems possible to\r\ntrace some of the older and better frescos in the catacombs to a very\r\nearly age; and Bible manuscripts were often copiously illuminated and\r\nillustrated even before the middle of the 4th century. An often-quoted\r\npassage from Tertullian (_De Pudic._ c. 10, cf. c. 7) shows that in his\r\nday the communion cup was wont to bear a representation of the Good\r\nShepherd. Clement of Alexandria (_Paedag._ iii. 11) mentions the dove,\r\nfish, ship, lyre, anchor, as suitable devices for Christian signet\r\nrings. Origen (c. _Celsum_, bk. 3) repudiates graven images as only fit\r\nfor demons.\r\n\r\nDuring the 4th and following centuries the tendency to enlist the fine\r\narts in the service of the church steadily advanced; not, however, so\r\nfar as appears, with the formal sanction of any regular ecclesiastical\r\nauthority, and certainly not without strong protests raised by more than\r\none powerful voice. From a passage in the writings of Gregory of Nyssa\r\n(_Orat. de Laudibus Theodori Martyris_, c. 2) it is easy to see how the\r\nstories of recent martyrs would offer themselves as tempting subjects\r\nfor the painter, and at the same time be considered to have received\r\nfrom him their best and most permanent expression; that this feeling was\r\nwidespread is shown in many places by Paulinus of Nola (_ob._ 431), from\r\nwhom we gather that not only martyrdoms and Bible histories, but also\r\nsymbols of the Trinity were in his day freely represented pictorially.\r\nAugustine (_De Cons. Ev._ i. 10) speaks less approvingly of those who\r\nlook for Christ and his apostles \"on painted walls\" rather than in his\r\nwritten word. How far the Christian feeling of the 4th and 5th centuries\r\nwas from being settled in favour of the employment of the fine arts is\r\nshown by such a case as that of Eusebius of Caesarea, who, in reply to a\r\nrequest of Constantia, sister of Constantine, for a picture of Christ,\r\nwrote that it was unlawful to possess images pretending to represent the\r\nSaviour either in his divine or in his human nature, and added that to\r\navoid the reproach of idolatry he had actually taken away from a lady\r\nfriend the pictures of Paul and of Christ which she had.[2] Similarly\r\nEpiphanius in a letter to John, bishop of Jerusalem, tells how in a\r\nchurch at Anablatha near Bethel he had found a curtain painted with the\r\nimage \"of Christ or of some other saint,\" which he had torn down and\r\nordered to be used for the burial of a pauper. The passage, however,\r\nreveals not only what Epiphanius thought on the subject, but also that\r\nsuch pictures must have been becoming frequent. Nilus, the disciple and\r\ndefender of Chrysostom, permitted the symbol of the cross in churches\r\nand also pictorial delineations of Old and New Testament history, but\r\ndeprecated other symbols, pictures of martyrs, and most of all the\r\nrepresentation of Christ. In the time of Gregory the Great the Western\r\nChurch obtained something like an authoritative declaration on the\r\nquestion about images, but in a sense not quite the same as that of the\r\nsynod of Elvira. Serenus of Marseilles had ordered the destruction of\r\nall sacred images within his diocese; this action called forth several\r\nletters from Pope Gregory (viii. 2. III; ix. 4. 11), in which he\r\ndisapproved of that course, and, drawing the distinction which has since\r\nbeen authoritative for the Roman Church, pointed out that--\r\n\r\n  \"It is one thing to worship a picture and another to learn from the\r\n  language of a picture what that is which ought to be worshipped. What\r\n  those who can read learn by means of writing, that do the uneducated\r\n  learn by looking at a picture.... That, therefore, ought not to have\r\n  been destroyed which had been placed in the churches, not for worship,\r\n  but solely for instructing the minds of the ignorant.\"\r\n\r\nWith regard to the symbol of the cross, its public use dates from the\r\ntime of Constantine, though, according to many Christian archaeologists\r\nit had, prior to that date, a very important place in the so-called\r\n\"disciplina arcani.\" The introduction of the crucifix was later;\r\noriginally the favourite combination was that of the figure of a lamb\r\nlying at the foot of the cross; the council of Constantinople, called\r\n\"in Trullo,\" in 692 enjoined that this symbol should be discontinued,\r\nand that where Christ was shown in connexion with his cross he should be\r\nrepresented in his human nature. In the catacombs Christ is never\r\nrepresented hanging on the cross, and the cross itself is only portrayed\r\nin a veiled and hesitating manner. In the Egyptian churches the cross\r\nwas a pagan symbol of life borrowed by the Christians and interpreted in\r\nthe pagan manner. The cross of the early Christian emperors was a\r\n_labarum_ or token of victory in war, a standard for use in battle.\r\nReligious feeling in the West recoiled from the crucifix as late as the\r\n6th century, and it was equally abhorrent to the Monophysites of the\r\nEast who regarded the human nature of Christ as swallowed up in the\r\ndivine. Nevertheless it seems to have originated in the East, perhaps as\r\na protest against the extreme Monophysites, who even denied the\r\npassibility of Christ. Perhaps the Nestorians, who clung to the human\r\naspect of Christ, introduced it about 550. From the East it soon passed\r\nto the West.\r\n\r\nNot until the 8th century were the religious and theological questions\r\nwhich connect themselves with image-worship distinctly raised in the\r\nEastern Church in their entirety. The controversy began with an address\r\nwhich Leo the Isaurian, in the tenth year of his reign (726), delivered\r\nin public \"in favour of overthrowing the holy and venerable images,\" as\r\nsays Theophanes (_Chronogr._, in Migne _Patr. Gr._ 108, 816). This\r\nemperor had, in the years 717 and 718, hurled back the tide of Arab\r\nconquest which threatened to engulf Byzantium, and had also shown\r\nhimself an able statesman and legislator. Born at Germanicia in Syria,\r\nand, before he mounted the throne, captain-general of the Anatolian\r\ntheme, he had come under the influence of the anti-idolatrous sects,\r\nsuch as the Jews, Montanists, Paulicians and Manicheans, which abounded\r\nin Asia Minor, but of which he was otherwise no friend. But his\r\nreligious reform was unpopular, especially among the women, who killed\r\nan official who, by the emperor's command, was destroying an image of\r\nChrist in the vestibule of the imperial palace of Chalcé. This _émeute_\r\nprovoked severe reprisals, and the partisans of the images were\r\nmutilated and killed, or beaten and exiled. A rival emperor even,\r\nAgallianus, was set up, who perished in his attempt to seize\r\nConstantinople. Italy also rose in arms, and Pope Gregory II. wrote to\r\nLeo blaming his interference in religious matters, though he dissuaded\r\nthe rebels in Venetia, the Exarchate and the Pentapolis from electing a\r\nnew emperor and marching against Leo. In 730 Germanus the patriarch\r\nresigned rather than subscribe to a decree condemning images; later he\r\nwas strangled, in exile and replaced by an iconoclast, Anastasius.\r\nMeanwhile, inside the Arab empire, John of Damascus wrote his three\r\ndogmatic discourses against the traducers of images, arguing that their\r\nuse was not idolatry but only a relative worship ([Greek: proskynêsis\r\nschetkê]). The next pope, Gregory III. convoked a council of\r\nninety-three bishops, which excommunicated the iconoclasts, and the\r\nfleet which Leo sent to retaliate on the Latin peninsula was lost in a\r\nstorm in the Adriatic. The most Leo was able to do was to double the\r\ntribute of Calabria and Sicily, confiscate the pope's revenues there,\r\nand impose on the bishops of south Italy a servitude to Byzantium which\r\nlasted for centuries.\r\n\r\nLeo III. died in June 740, and then his son Constantine V. began a\r\npersecution of the image-worshippers in real earnest. In his eagerness to\r\nrestore the simplicity of the primitive church he even assailed\r\nMariolatry, intercession of saints, relics and perhaps infant baptism, to\r\nthe scandal even of the iconoclast bishops themselves. His reign began\r\nwith the seizure for eighteen months of Constantinople by his\r\nbrother-in-law Artavasdes, who temporarily restored the images. He was\r\ncaptured and beheaded with his accomplices in November 742, and in\r\nFebruary 754 Constantine held in the palace of Hieria a council of 388\r\nbishops, mostly of the East; the patriarchs of Rome, Antioch, Alexandria\r\nand Jerusalem refused to attend. In it images were condemned, but the\r\nother equally conservative leanings of the emperor found no favour. The\r\nchief upholders of images, the patriarch Germanus, George of Cyprus and\r\nJohn of Damascus, were anathematized, and Christians forbidden to adore\r\nor make images or even to hide them. These decrees were obstinately\r\nresisted, especially by the monks, large numbers of whom fled to Italy.\r\nIn 765 the emperor demanded of his subjects all over his empire an oath\r\non the cross that they detested images, and St Stephen the younger, the\r\nchief upholder of them, was murdered in the streets. A regular crusade\r\nnow began against monks and nuns, and images and relics were destroyed on\r\na great scale. In parts of Asia Minor (Lydia and Caria) the monks were\r\neven forced to marry the nuns. In 769 Pope Stephen III. condemned the\r\ncouncil of Hieria, and in 775 Constantine V. died. His son Leo IV. died\r\nin 780, leaving a widow, Irene, of Athenian birth, who seized the\r\nopportunity presented by the minority of her ten-year-old son Constantine\r\nVI. to restore the images and dispersed relics. In 784 she invited Pope\r\nAdrian I. to come and preside over a fresh council, which was to reverse\r\nthat of 754 and heal the schism with Rome. In August 786 the council met,\r\nbut was broken up by the imperial guards, who were Easterns and sturdy\r\niconoclasts. Irene replaced them by a more trustworthy force, and\r\nconvoked a fresh council of three hundred bishops and monks innumerable\r\nin September 787, at Nicaea in the church of St Sophia. The cult of\r\nimages was now solemnly restored, iconoclast bishops deposed or\r\nreconciled, the dogmatic theory of images defined, and church discipline\r\nre-established. The order thus imposed lasted twenty-four years, until a\r\nmilitary revolution placed a soldier of fortune, half Armenian, half\r\nPersian, named Leo, on the throne; he, like his soldiers, was persuaded\r\nthat the ill-success of the Roman arms against Bulgarians and other\r\ninvaders was due to the idolatry rampant at court and elsewhere. The\r\nsoldiers stoned the image of Christ which Irene had set up afresh in the\r\npalace of Chalcé, and this provoked a counter-demonstration of the\r\nclergy. Leo feigned for a while to be on their side, but on the 2nd of\r\nFebruary 815, in the sanctuary of St Sophia, publicly refused to\r\nprostrate himself before the images, with the approbation of the army and\r\nof many bishops who were iconoclasts at heart. Irene's patriarch\r\nNicephorus was now deposed and one Theodotus, a kinsman of Constantine\r\nCopronymus, consecrated in his place on the 1st of April 815. A fresh\r\ncouncil was soon convoked, which cursed Irene and re-enacted the decrees\r\nof 754. This reaction lasted only for a generation under Leo the\r\nArmenian, who died 820, Michael II. 820-829, and Theophilus 829-842; and\r\nwas frustrated mainly by the exertions of Theodore of Studion and his\r\nmonks, called the Studitae. Theodore refused to attend or recognize the\r\nnew council, and was banished first to Bithynia and thence to Smyrna,\r\nwhence he continued to address his appeals to the pope, to the eastern\r\npatriarchs and to his dispersed monks. He died in 826. Theophilus, the\r\nlast of the iconoclast emperors, was a devoted Mariolater and\r\ncontroversialist who invited the monks to discuss the question of images\r\nwith him, and whipped or branded them when he was out-argued; he at\r\nlength banished them from the cities, and branded on the hands a painter\r\nof holy pictures, Lazarus by name, who declined to secularize his art; he\r\nalso raised to the patriarchal throne John Hylilas, chief instigator of\r\nthe reaction of 815. In 842 Theophilus died, leaving his wife Theodora\r\nregent; she was, like Irene, addicted to images, and chose as patriarch a\r\nmonk, Methodius, whom the emperor Michael had imprisoned for laying\r\nbefore him Pope Paschal I.'s letter of protest. John Hylilas was deposed\r\nand flogged in turn. A fresh council was now held which re-enacted the\r\ndecrees of 787, and on the 20th of February 842 the new patriarch, the\r\nempress, clergy and court dignitaries assisted in the church of St Sophia\r\nat a solemn restoration of images which lasted until the advent of the\r\nTurks. The struggle had gone on for 116 years.\r\n\r\nThe iconoclastic movement is perhaps the most dramatic episode in\r\nByzantine history, and the above outline of its external events must be\r\ncompleted by an appreciation of its deeper historical and religious\r\nsignificance and results. We can distinguish three parties among the\r\ncombatants:--\r\n\r\n1. The partisans of image worship. These were chiefly found in the\r\nHellenic portions of the empire, where Greek art had once held sway. The\r\nmonks were the chief champions of images, because they were illuminators\r\nand artists. Their doctors taught that the same grace of the Holy Spirit\r\nwhich imbued the living saint attaches after death to his relics, name,\r\nimage and picture. The latter are thus no mere representations, but as\r\nit were emanations from the archetype, vehicles of the supernatural\r\npersonality represented, and possessed of an inherent sacramental value\r\nand power, such as the name of Jesus had for the earliest believers.\r\nHere Christian image-worship borders on the beliefs which underlie\r\nsympathetic magic (see IMAGE WORSHIP).\r\n\r\n2. The iconoclasts proper, who not only condemned image worship in the\r\nsense just explained but rejected all religious art whatever. Fleeting\r\nmatter to their mind was not worthy to embody or reflect heavenly\r\nsupersensuous energies denoted by the names of Christ and the saints.\r\nFor the same reason they rejected relics and, as a rule, the worship of\r\nthe cross. Statues of Christ, especially of him hanging on the cross,\r\ninspired the greatest horror and indignation; and this is why none of\r\nthe graven images of Christ, common before the outbreak of the movement,\r\nsurvive. More than this--although the synod of 692 specially allowed the\r\ncrucifix, yet Greek churches have discarded it ever since the 8th\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThis idea that material representation involves a profanation of divine\r\npersonages, while disallowing all religious art which goes beyond\r\nscroll-work, spirals, flourishes and geometrical designs, yet admits to\r\nthe full of secular art; and accordingly the iconoclastic emperors\r\nreplaced the holy pictures in churches with frescoes of hunting scenes,\r\nand covered their palaces with garden scenes where men were plucking\r\nfruit and birds singing amid the foliage. Contemporary Mahommedans did\r\nthe same, for it is an error to suppose that this religion was from the\r\nfirst hostile to profane art. At one time the mosques were covered with\r\nmosaics, analogous to those of Ravenna, depicting scenes from the life\r\nof Mahomet and the prophets. The Arabs only forbade plastic art in the\r\n9th century, nor were their essentially Semitic scruples ever shared by\r\nthe Persians.\r\n\r\nThe prejudice we are considering is closely connected with the\r\nManichaean view of matter, which in strict consistency rejected the\r\nbelief that God was really made flesh, or really died on the cross. The\r\nManichaeans were therefore, by reason of their dualism, arch-enemies no\r\nless of Christian art than of relics and cross-worship; the Monophysites\r\nwere equally so by reason of their belief that the divine nature in\r\nChrist entirely absorbed and sublated the human; they shaded off into\r\nthe party of the _aphthartodoketes_, who held that his human body was\r\nincorruptible and made of ethereal fire, and that his divine nature was\r\nimpassible. Their belief made them, like the Manichaeans, hostile to\r\nmaterial portraiture of Christ, especially of his sufferings on the\r\ncross. All these nearly allied schools of Christian thought could,\r\nmoreover, address, as against the image-worshippers, a very effective\r\nappeal to the Bible and to Christian antiquity. Now Egypt, Asia Minor,\r\nArmenia, western Syria and the Hauran were almost wholly given up to\r\nthese forms of opinion. Accordingly in all the remains of the Christian\r\nart of the Hauran one seeks in vain for any delineation of human face or\r\nfigure. The art of these countries is mainly geometrical, and allows\r\nonly of monograms crowned with laurels, of peacocks, of animals\r\ngambolling amid foliage, of fruit and flowers, of crosses which are\r\neither _svastikas_ of Hindu and Mycenaean type, or so lost in enveloping\r\narabesques as to be merely decorative. Such was the only religious art\r\npermitted by the Christian sentiment of these countries, and also of the\r\nlarge _enclaves_ of semi-Manichaean belief formed in the Balkans by the\r\ntransportation thither of Armenians and Paulicians. And it is important\r\nto remark that the protagonists of iconoclasm in Byzantium came from\r\nthese lands where image cult offended the deepest religious instincts of\r\nthe masses. Leo the Isaurian had all the scruples of a Paulician, even\r\nto the rejection of the cult of Virgin and saints; Constantine V. was\r\nopenly such. Michael Balbus was reared in Phrygia among Montanists. The\r\nsoldiers and captains of the Byzantine garrisons were equally Armenians\r\nand Syrians, in whom the sight of a crucifix or image set up for worship\r\ninspired nothing but horror.\r\n\r\nThe issue of the struggle was not a complete victory even in Byzantium\r\nfor the partisans of image-worship. The Iconoclasts left an indelible\r\nimpress on the Christian art of the Greek Church, in so far as they put\r\nan end to the use of graven images; for the Eastern icon is a flat\r\npicture, less easily regarded than would be a statue as a nidus within\r\nwhich a spirit can lurk. Half the realm of creative art, that of\r\nstatuary, was thus suppressed at a blow; and the other half, painting,\r\nforfeited all the grace and freedom, all the capacity of new themes,\r\nforms and colours, all the development which we see in the Latin Church.\r\nThe Greeks have produced no Giotto, no Fra Angelico, no Raphael. Their\r\nartists have no choice of subjects and no initiative. Colour, dress,\r\nattitude, grouping of figures are all dictated by traditional rules, set\r\nout in regular manuals. God the Father may not be depicted at all--a\r\nrestriction intelligible when we remember that the image in theory is\r\nfraught with the virtue of the archetype; but everywhere the utmost\r\ntimidity is shown. What else could an artist do but make a slavish and\r\nexact copy of old pictures which worked miracles and perhaps had the\r\nreputation as well of having fallen from heaven?\r\n\r\n3. Between these extreme parties the Roman Church took the middle way of\r\ncommon sense. The hair-splitting distinction of the Byzantine doctors\r\nbetween veneration due to images ([Greek: proskynêsis timêtikê]), and\r\nthe adoration ([Greek: proskynêsis latreutikê]) due to God alone, was\r\ndropped, and the utility of pictures for the illiterate emphasized.\r\nTheir use was declared to be this, that they taught the ignorant through\r\nthe eye what they should adore with the mind; they are not themselves to\r\nbe adored. Such was Gregory the Great's teaching, and such also is the\r\npurport of the Caroline books, which embody the conclusions arrived at\r\nby the bishops of Germany, Gaul and Aquitaine, presided over by papal\r\nlegates at the council of Frankfort in 794, and incidentally also reveal\r\nthe hatred and contempt of Charlemagne for the Byzantine empire as an\r\ninstitution, and for Irene, its ruler, as a person. The theologians whom\r\nLouis the Pious convened at Paris in 825, to answer the letter received\r\nfrom the iconoclast emperor Michael Balbus, were as hostile to the\r\northodox Greeks as to the image-worshippers, and did not scruple to\r\ncensure Pope Adrian for having approved of the empress Irene's attitude.\r\nThe council of Trent decided afresh in the same sense.\r\n\r\nTwo incidental results of the iconoclastic movement must be noticed, the\r\none of less, the other of more importance. The lesser one was the flight\r\nof Greek iconolatrous monks from Asia Minor and the Levant to Sicily and\r\nCalabria, where they established convents which for centuries were the\r\nwestern homes of Greek learning, and in which were written not a few of\r\nthe oldest Greek MSS. found in our libraries. The greater event was the\r\nscission between East and West. The fury of the West against the\r\niconoclastic emperors was such that the whole of Italy clamoured for\r\nwar. It is true that Pope Stephen II. applied in 753 to Constantine V.,\r\none of the worst destroyers of images, for aid against the Lombards, for\r\nthe emperor of Byzantium was still regarded as the natural champion of\r\nthe church. But Constantine refused aid, and the pope turned to the\r\nFrankish King Pippin. The die was cast. Henceforth Rome was linked with\r\nthe Carolingian house in an alliance which culminated in the coronation\r\nof Charlemagne by the pope on the 25th of December 800.\r\n\r\nIn the crusading epoch the Cathars and Paulicians carried all over\r\nEurope the old iconoclastic spirit, and perhaps helped to transmit it to\r\nWycliffe and Hus. Not the least racy clause in the document compiled\r\nabout 1389 by the Wycliffites in defence of their defunct teacher is the\r\nfollowing: \"Hit semes that this offrynge ymages is a sotile cast of\r\nAntichriste and his clerkis for to drawe almes fro pore men ... certis,\r\nthese ymages of hemselfe may do nouther gode nor yvel to mennis soules,\r\nbut thai myghtten warme a man's body in colde, if thai were sette upon a\r\nfire.\"\r\n\r\nAt the period of the Reformation it was unanimously felt by the\r\nreforming party that, with the invocation of saints and the practice of\r\nreverencing their relics, the adoration of images ought also to cease.\r\nThe leaders of the movement were not, however, perfectly agreed on the\r\nquestion as to whether these might not in some circumstances be retained\r\nin churches. Luther had no sympathy with the iconoclastic outbreaks\r\nwhich then occurred; he classed images in themselves as among the\r\n\"adiaphora,\" and condemned only their cultus; so also the \"Confessio\r\nTetrapolitana\" leaves Christians free to have them or not, if only due\r\nregard be had to what is expedient and edifying. The \"Heidelberg\r\nCatechism,\" however, emphatically declares that images are not to be\r\ntolerated at all in churches.\r\n\r\n  SOURCES.--\"Acts of the Seventh Ecumenical Council held in Nicaea,\r\n  787,\" in Mansi's _Concilia_, vols. xii. and xiii.; \"Acts of the\r\n  Iconoclast Council of 815,\" in a treatise of Nicephorus discovered by\r\n  M.

It is generally attached to the\r\nfirst eastern pier or column and rises to the level of the springing of\r\nthe vault. The iconostasis or image-bearer has generally three doors,\r\none on each side of the central door, beyond which is the principal\r\naltar. The screen is subdivided into four or five tiers, each tier\r\ndecorated with a series of panels containing representations of the\r\nsaints: of these only the heads, hands and feet are painted, the bodies\r\nbeing covered with embossed metal work, richly gilded. There is a fine\r\nexample in the Russo-Greek chapel, Welbeck Street, London, which was\r\nrebuilt in 1864-1865.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nICOSAHEDRON (Gr. [Greek: eikosi], twenty, and [Greek: hedra], a face or\r\nbase), in geometry, a solid enclosed by twenty faces. The \"regular\r\nicosahedron\" is one of the Platonic solids; the \"great icosahedron\" is a\r\nKepler-Poinsot solid; and the \"truncated icosahedron\" is an Archimedean\r\nsolid (see POLYHEDRON). In crystallography the icosahedron is a possible\r\nform, but it has not been observed; it is closely simulated by a\r\ncombination of the octahedron and pentagonal dodecahedron, which has\r\ntwenty triangular faces, but only eight are equilateral, the remaining\r\ntwelve being isosceles (see CRYSTALLOGRAPHY).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nICTERUS, a bird so called by classical authors, and supposed by Pliny to\r\nbe the same as the _Galgulus_, which is generally identified with the\r\ngolden oriole (_Oriolus galbula_).[1] It signified a bird in the plumage\r\nof which yellow or green predominated, and hence Brisson did not take an\r\nunhappy liberty when he applied it in a scientific sense to some birds\r\nof the New World of which the same could be said. These are now held to\r\nconstitute a distinct family, _Icteridae_, intermediate it would seem\r\nbetween the BUNTINGS (q.v.) and STARLINGS (q.v.); and, while many of\r\nthem are called troopials (the English equivalent of the French\r\n_Troupiales_, first used by Brisson), others are known as the American\r\nGRACKLES (q.v.). The typical species of _Icterus_ is the _Oriolus\r\nicterus_ of Linnaeus, the _Icterus vulgaris_ of Daudin and modern\r\nornithologists, an inhabitant of northern Brazil, Guiana, Venezuela,\r\noccasionally visiting some of the Antilles and of the United States.\r\nThirty-three species of the genus _Icterus_ alone, and more than seventy\r\nothers belonging to upwards of a score of genera, are recognized by\r\nSclater and Salvin (_Nomenclator_, pp. 35-39) as belonging to the\r\nNeotropical Region, though a few of them emigrate to the northward in\r\nsummer. _Cassicus_ and _Ostinops_ may perhaps be named as the most\r\nremarkable. They are nearly all gregarious birds, many of them with loud\r\nand in most cases, where they have been observed, with melodious notes,\r\nrendering them favourites in captivity, for they readily learn to\r\nwhistle simple tunes. Some have a plumage wholly black, others are\r\nrichly clad, as is the well-known Baltimore oriole, golden robin or\r\nhangnest of the United States, _Icterus baltimore_, whose brightly\r\ncontrasted black and orange have conferred upon it the name it most\r\ncommonly bears in North America, those colours being, says Catesby\r\n(_Birds of Carolina_, i. 48), the tinctures of the armorial bearings of\r\nthe Calverts, Lords Baltimore, the original grantees of Maryland, but\r\nprobably more correctly those of their liveries. The most divergent form\r\nof _Icteridae_ seems to be that known in the United States as the\r\nmeadow-lark, _Sturnella magna_ or _S. ludoviciana_, a bird which in\r\naspect and habits has considerable resemblance to the larks of the Old\r\nWorld, _Alaudidae_, to which, however, it has no near affinity, while\r\n_Dolichonyx oryzivorus_, the bobolink or rice-bird, with its very\r\nbunting-like bill, is not much less aberrant.     (A. N.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n  [1] The number of names by which this species was known in ancient\r\n    times--_Chloris_ or _Chlorion_, _Galbula_ (akin to _Galgulus_),\r\n    _Parra_ and _Vireo_--may be explained by its being a common and\r\n    conspicuous bird, as well as one which varied in plumage according to\r\n    age and sex (see ORIOLE). Owing to its general colour, _Chloris_ was\r\n    in time transferred to the Greenfinch (q.v.), while the names\r\n    _Galbula_, _Parra_ and _Vireo_ have since been utilized by\r\n    ornithologists (see JACAMAR and JACANA).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nICTINUS, the architect of the Parthenon at Athens, of the Hall of the\r\nMysteries at Eleusis, and of the temple of Apollo at Bassae, near\r\nPhigalia.

We know little else\r\nabout him; but the remains of his two great temples testify to his\r\nwonderful mastery of the principles of Greek architecture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIDA (d. 559), king of Bernicia, became king in 547, soon after the\r\nfoundation of the kingdom of Bernicia by the Angles. He built the\r\nfortress of Bebbanburh, the modern Bamborough, and after his death his\r\nkingdom, which did not extend south of the Tees, passed in turn to six\r\nof his sons. The surname of \"Flame-Bearer,\" sometimes applied to him,\r\nrefers, however, not to Ida, but to his son Theodric (d. 587).\r\n\r\n  See J. R. Green, _Making of England_, vol. i. (London, 1897).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIDAHO, a western state of the United States of America, situated between\r\n42° and 49° N. lat. and 111° and 117° W. long. It is bounded N. by\r\nBritish Columbia and Montana, E. by Montana and Wyoming, S. by Utah and\r\nNevada, and W. by Oregon and Washington. Its total area is 83,888 sq.\r\nm., of which 83,354 sq. m. are land surface, and of this 41,851.55 sq.\r\nm. were in July 1908 unappropriated and unreserved public lands of the\r\nUnited States, and 31,775.7 sq. m. were forest reserves, of which\r\n15,153.5 sq. m. were reserved between the 1st of July 1906 and the 1st\r\nof July 1907.\r\n\r\n  _Physical Features._--Idaho's elevation above sea-level varies from\r\n  738 ft. (at Lewiston, Nez Perce county) to 12,078 ft. (Hyndman Peak,\r\n  on the boundary between Custer and Blaine counties), and its mean\r\n  elevation is about 4500 ft. The S.E. corner of the wedge-shaped\r\n  surface of the state is a part of the Great Basin region of the United\r\n  States. The remainder of the state is divided by a line running S.E.\r\n  and N.W., the smaller section, to the N. and E., belonging to the\r\n  Rocky Mountain region, and the larger, S. and W. of this imaginary\r\n  line, being a part of the Columbia Plateau region. The topography of\r\n  the Great Basin region in Idaho is similar to that of the same region\r\n  in other states (see NEVADA); in Idaho it forms a very small part of\r\n  the state; its mountains are practically a part of the Wasatch Range\r\n  of Utah; and the southward drainage of the region (into Great Salt\r\n  Lake, by Bear river) also separates it from the other parts of the\r\n  state. The Rocky Mountain region of Idaho is bounded by most of the\r\n  state's irregular E. boundary--the Bitter Root, the Coeur d'Alene and\r\n  the Cabinet ranges being parts of the Rocky Mountain System. The Rocky\r\n  Mountain region reaches across the N. part of the state (the\r\n  Panhandle), and well into the middle of the state farther S., where\r\n  the region is widest and where the Salmon River range is the principal\r\n  one. The region is made up in general of high ranges deeply glaciated,\r\n  preserving some remnants of ancient glaciers, and having fine \"Alpine\"\r\n  scenery, with many sharp peaks and ridges, U-shaped valleys, cirques,\r\n  lakes and waterfalls. In the third physiographic region, the Columbia\r\n  plateau, are the Saw Tooth, Boisé, Owyhee and other rugged ranges,\r\n  especially on the S. and W. borders of the region. The most prominent\r\n  features of this part of the state are the arid Snake river plains and\r\n  three mountain-like elevations--Big, Middle and East Buttes--that rise\r\n  from their midst. The plains extend from near the S.E. corner of the\r\n  state in a curved course to the W. and N.W. for about 350 m. over a\r\n  belt 50 to 75 m. wide, and cover about 30,000 sq. m. Where they cross\r\n  the W. border at Lewiston is the lowest elevation in the state, 738\r\n  ft. above the sea. Instead of being one plain formed by erosion, this\r\n  region is rather a series of plains built up with sheets of lava,\r\n  several thousand feet deep, varying considerably in elevation and in\r\n  smoothness of surface according to the nature of the lava, and being\r\n  greater in area than any other lava beds in North America except those\r\n  of the Columbia river, which are of similar formation and, with the\r\n  Snake river plains, form the Columbia plateau. Many volcanic cones\r\n  mark the surface, but by far the most prominent among them are Big\r\n  Butte, which rises precipitously 2350 ft. above the plain (7659 ft.\r\n  above the sea) in the E. part of Blaine county, and East Butte, 700\r\n  ft. above the plain, in the N.W. part of Bingham county. Middle Butte\r\n  (400 ft. above the plain, also in Bingham county) is an upraised block\r\n  of stratified basalt. The Snake river (which receives all the drainage\r\n  of Idaho except small amounts taken by the Spokane, the Pend Oreille\r\n  and the Kootenai in the N., all emptying directly into the Columbia,\r\n  and by some minor streams of the S.E. that empty into Great Salt Lake,\r\n  Utah) rises in Yellowstone National Park a few miles from the heads of\r\n  the Madison fork of the Missouri, which flows to the Gulf of Mexico,\r\n  and the Green fork of the Colorado, which flows to the Gulf of\r\n  California. It flows S.W. and then W. for about 800 m. in a tremendous\r\n  cañon across southern Idaho; turns N. and runs for 200 m. as the\r\n  boundary between Idaho and Oregon (and for a short distance between\r\n  Idaho and Washington); turns again at Lewiston (where it ceases to be\r\n  the boundary, and where the Clearwater empties into it) to the W. into\r\n  a deep narrow valley, and joins the Columbia in S.E. Washington.\r\n  Practically all the valley of the Snake from Idaho Falls in S.E. Idaho\r\n  (Bingham county) to the mouth is of cañon character, with walls from a\r\n  few hundred to 6000 ft. in height (about 650 m. in Idaho). The finest\r\n  parts are among the most magnificent in the west; among its falls are\r\n  the American (Oneida and Blaine counties), and the Shoshone and the\r\n  Salmon (Lincoln county). At the Shoshone Falls the river makes a\r\n  sudden plunge of nearly 200 ft., and the Falls have been compared with\r\n  the Niagara and Zambezi; a short distance back of the main fall is a\r\n  cataract of 125 ft., the Bridal Veil. Between Henry's Fork and Malade\r\n  (or Big Wood) river, a distance of 200 m., the river apparently has no\r\n  northern tributaries; but several streams, as the Camas, Medicine\r\n  Lodge and Birch creeks, and Big and Little Lost rivers, which fail to\r\n  penetrate the plain of the Snake after reaching its border, are\r\n  believed to join it through subterranean channels. The more important\r\n  affluents are the North Fork in the E., the Raft, Salmon Falls and the\r\n  Bruneau in the S., the Owyhee and the Payette in the S.W., and the\r\n  Salmon and Clearwater in the W. The scenery on some of these\r\n  tributaries is almost as beautiful as that of the Snake, though\r\n  lacking the grandeur of its greater scale. In 1904 electricity,\r\n  generated by water-power from the rivers, notably the Snake, began to\r\n  be utilized in mining operations. Scattered among the mountains are\r\n  numerous (glacial) lakes. In the N. are: Coeur d'Alene Lake, in\r\n  Kootenai county, about 30 m. long and from 2 to 4 m. wide, drained by\r\n  the Spokane river; Priest Lake, in Bonner county, 20 m. long and about\r\n  10 m. wide; and mostly in Bonner, but partly in Kootenai county, a\r\n  widening of Clark Fork, Lake Pend Oreille, 60 m. long and from 3 to 15\r\n  m. wide, which is spanned by a trestle of the Northern Pacific 8400\r\n  ft. long. Bear Lake, in the extreme S.E., lies partly in Utah. Mineral\r\n  springs and hot springs are also a notable feature of Idaho's\r\n  physiography, being found in Washington, Ada, Blaine, Bannock, Cassia,\r\n  Owyhee, Oneida, Nez Perce, Kootenai, Shoshone and Fremont counties. At\r\n  Soda Springs in Bannock county are scores of springs whose waters,\r\n  some ice cold and some warm, contain magnesia, soda, iron, sulphur,\r\n  &c.; near Hailey, Blaine county, water with a temperature of 144° F.\r\n  is discharged from numerous springs; and at Boisé, water with a\r\n  temperature of 165° is obtained from wells.\r\n\r\n  The fauna and flora of Idaho are similar in general to those of the\r\n  other states in the north-western part of the United States.\r\n\r\n  _Climate._--The mean annual temperature of Idaho from 1898 to 1903 was\r\n  45.5° F. There are several distinct climate zones within the state.\r\n  North of Clearwater river the climate is comparatively mild, the\r\n  maximum in 1902 (96° F.) being lower than the highest temperature in\r\n  the state and the minimum (-16°) higher than the lowest temperature\r\n  registered. The mildest region of the state is the Snake river basin\r\n  between Twin Falls and Lewiston, and the valley of the Boisé, Payette\r\n  and Weiser rivers; here the mean annual temperature in 1902 was 52°\r\n  F., the maximum was 106° F., and the minimum was -13° F. In the Upper\r\n  Snake basin, in the Camas prairie and Lost river regions, the climate\r\n  is much colder, the highest temperature in 1902 being 101° and the\r\n  lowest -35° F. The mean annual rainfall for the entire state in 1903\r\n  was 16.60 in.; the highest amount recorded was at Murray, Shoshone\r\n  county (37.70 in.) and the lowest was at Garnet, Elmore county (5.69\r\n  in.).\r\n\r\n  _Agriculture._--The principal source of wealth in Idaho was in 1900\r\n  agriculture, but it had long been secondary to mining, and its\r\n  development had been impeded by certain natural disadvantages. Except\r\n  for the broad valleys of the Panhandle, where the soils are black in\r\n  colour and rich in vegetable mould, the surface of the state is arid;\r\n  the Snake river valley is a vast lava bed, covered with deposits of\r\n  salt and sand, or soils of volcanic origin. And, apart from this, the\r\n  farming country was long without transport facilities. The fertile\r\n  northern plateaus, the Camas and Nez Perce prairies and the Palouse\r\n  country--a wonderful region for growing the _durum_ or macaroni\r\n  wheat--until 1898 had no market nearer than Lewiston, 50-70 m. away;\r\n  and even in 1898, when the railway was built, large parts of the\r\n  region were not tapped by it, and were as much as 30 m. from any\r\n  shipping point, for the road had followed the Clearwater. In the arid\r\n  southern region, also, there was no railway until 1885, when the\r\n  Oregon Short Line was begun. Like limitations in N. and S. had like\r\n  effects: for years the country was devoted to live-stock, which could\r\n  be driven to a distant market. Timothy was grown in the northern, and\r\n  alfalfa in the southern region as a forage crop. Even at this earliest\r\n  period, irrigation, simple and individual, had begun in the southern\r\n  section, the head waters of the few streams in this district being\r\n  soon surrounded by farms. Co-operation and colonization followed, and\r\n  more ditching was done, co-operative irrigation canals were\r\n  constructed with some elaborate and large dams and head gates. The\r\n  Carey Act (1894) and the Federal Reclamation Act (1902) introduced the\r\n  most important period of irrigation. Under the Carey Act the Twin\r\n  Falls project, deriving water from the Snake river near Twin Falls,\r\n  and irrigating more than 200,000 acres, was completed in 1903-1905.\r\n  The great projects undertaken with Federal aid were: the Minidoka, in\r\n  Lincoln and Cassia counties, of which survey began in March 1903 and\r\n  construction in December 1904, and which was completed in 1907,\r\n  commanding an irrigable area of 130,000-150,000 acres,[1] and has a\r\n  diversion dam (rock-fill type) 600 ft. long, and 130 m. of canals and\r\n  100 m. of laterals; the larger Payette-Boisé project in Ada, Canyon\r\n  and Owyhee counties (372,000 acres irrigable; 300,000 now desert; 60%\r\n  privately owned), whose principal features are the Payette dam\r\n  (rock-fill), 100 ft. high and 400 ft. long, and the Boisé dam\r\n  (masonry), 33 ft. high and 400 ft. long, 200 m. of canals, 100 m. of\r\n  laterals, a tunnel 1100 ft. long and 12,500 h.p. transmitted 29 m.,\r\n  3000 h.p. being necessary to pump to a height of 50-90 ft. water for\r\n  the irrigation of 15,000 acres; and the Dubois project, the largest in\r\n  the state, on which survey and reconnaissance work were done in\r\n  1903-1904, which requires storage sites on the North Fork of the\r\n  Snake and on nearly all the important branches of the North Fork, and\r\n  whose field is 200,000--250,000 acres, almost entirely Federal\r\n  property, in the W. end of Fremont county between Mud Lake and the\r\n  lower end of Big Lost river. A further step in irrigation is the\r\n  utilization of underground waters: in the Big Camas Prairie region,\r\n  Blaine county, water 10 ft. below the surface is tapped and pumped by\r\n  electricity generated from the only surface water of the region, Camas\r\n  Creek. In 1899 the value of the crops and other agricultural products\r\n  of the irrigated region amounted to more than seven-tenths of the\r\n  total for the state. In 1907, according to the _Report_ of the state\r\n  commissioner of immigration, 1,559,915 irrigated acres were under\r\n  cultivation, and 3,266,386 acres were \"covered\" by canals 3789 m. long\r\n  and costing $11,257,023.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Map of Idaho and Montana.]\r\n\r\n  Up to 1900 the most prosperous period (absolutely) in the agricultural\r\n  development of the state was the last decade of the 19th century; the\r\n  relative increase, however, was greater between 1880 and 1890. The\r\n  number of farms increased from 1885 in 1880 to 6603 in 1890 and to\r\n  17,471 in 1900; the farm acreage from 327,798 in 1880 to 1,302,256 in\r\n  1890 and to 3,204,903 acres in 1900; the irrigated area (exclusive of\r\n  farms on Indian reservations) from 217,005 acres in 1889 to 602,568\r\n  acres in 1899; the value of products increased from $1,515,314 in 1879\r\n  to $3,848,930 in 1889, and to $18,051,625 in 1899; the value of farm\r\n  land with improvements (including buildings) from $2,832,890 in 1880\r\n  to $17,431,580 in 1890 and $42,318,183 in 1900; the value of\r\n  implements and machinery from $363,930 in 1880 to $1,172,460 in 1890\r\n  and to $3,295,045 in 1900; and that of live-stock from $4,023,800 in\r\n  1880 to $7,253,490 in 1890 and to $21,657,974 in 1900. In 1900 the\r\n  average size of farms was 183.4 acres. Cultivation by owners is the\r\n  prevailing form of tenure, 91.3% of the farms being so operated in\r\n  1900 (2.3% by cash tenants and 6.4% by share tenants). As illustrative\r\n  of agricultural conditions the contrast of the products of farms\r\n  operated by Indians, Chinese and whites is of considerable interest,\r\n  the value of products (not fed to live-stock) per acre of the 563\r\n  Indian farms being in 1899 $1.40, that of the 16,876 white farms\r\n  $4.67, and that of the 23 Chinese farms intensively cultivated and\r\n  devoted to market vegetables $69.83.\r\n\r\n  The income from agriculture in 1899 was almost equally divided between\r\n  crops ($8,951,440) and animal products ($8,784,364)--in that year\r\n  forest products were valued at $315,821. Of the crops, hay and forage\r\n  were the most valuable ($4,238,993), yielding 47.4% of the total value\r\n  of crops, an increase of more than 200% over that of 1889, and in\r\n  1907, according to the _Year-book_ of the Department of Agriculture,\r\n  the crop was valued at $8,585,000. Wheat, which in 1899 ranked second\r\n  ($2,131,953), showed an increase of more than 400% in the decade, and\r\n  the farm value of the crop of 1907, according to the _Year-book_ of\r\n  the United States Department of Agriculture, was $5,788,000; the value\r\n  of the barley crop in 1899 ($312,730) also increased more than 400%\r\n  over that of 1889, and in 1907 the farm value of the product,\r\n  according to the same authority, was $1,265,000; the value of the oat\r\n  crop in 1899 ($702,955) showed an increase of more than 300% in the\r\n  decade, and the value of the product in 1907, according to the United\r\n  States Department of Agriculture, was $2,397,000.\r\n\r\n  More than one-half of the cereal crop in 1905 was produced in the\r\n  prairie and plateau region of Nez Perce and Latah counties. The\r\n  production of orchard fruits (apples, cherries, peaches, pears, plums\r\n  and prunes) increased greatly from 1889 to 1899; the six counties of\r\n  Ada, Canyon (probably the leading fruit county of the state), Latah\r\n  (famous for apples), Washington, Owyhee and Nez Perce had in 1900 89%\r\n  of the plum and prune trees, 85% of all pear trees, 78% of all cherry\r\n  trees, and 74% of all apple trees in the state, and in 1906 it was\r\n  estimated by the State Commissioner of Immigration that there were\r\n  nearly 48,000 acres of land devoted to orchard fruits in Idaho.\r\n  Viticulture is of importance, particularly in the Lewiston valley. In\r\n  1906, 234,000 tons of sugar beets were raised, and fields in the Boisé\r\n  valley raised 30 tons per acre.\r\n\r\n  Of the animal products in 1899, the most valuable was live-stock sold\r\n  during the year ($3,909,454); the stock-raising industry was carried\r\n  on most extensively in the S.E. part of the state. Wool ranked second\r\n  in value ($2,210,790), and according to the estimate of the National\r\n  Association of Wool Manufactures for 1907, Idaho ranked fourth among\r\n  the wool-producing states in number of sheep (2,500,000), third in\r\n  wool, washed and unwashed (17,250,000 lb.), and fourth in scoured wool\r\n  (5,692,500 lb.). In January 1908, according to the _Year-book_ of the\r\n  Department of Agriculture, the number and farm values of live-stock\r\n  were: milch cows, 69,000, valued at $2,208,000, and other neat cattle,\r\n  344,000, valued at $5,848,000; horses, 150,000, $11,250,000; sheep,\r\n  3,575,000, $12,691,000; and swine, 130,000, $910,000. According to\r\n  state reports for 1906, most of the neat cattle were then on ranges in\r\n  Lemhi, Idaho, Washington, Cassia and Owyhee counties; Nez Perce,\r\n  Canyon, Fremont, Idaho, and Washington counties had the largest number\r\n  of horses; Owyhee, Blaine and Canyon counties had the largest numbers\r\n  of sheep, and Idaho and Nez Perce counties were the principal\r\n  swine-raising regions. The pasture lands of the state have been\r\n  greatly decreased by the increase of forest reserves, especially by\r\n  the large reservations made in 1906-1907.\r\n\r\n  _Mining._--The mineral resource of Idaho are second only to the\r\n  agricultural; indeed it was primarily the discovery of the immense\r\n  value of the deposits of gold and silver about 1860 that led to the\r\n  settlement of Idaho Territory. In Idaho, as elsewhere, the first form\r\n  of mining was a very lucrative working of placer deposits; this gave\r\n  way to vein mining and a greatly reduced production of gold and silver\r\n  after 1878, on account of the exhaustion of the placers. Then came an\r\n  adjustment to new conditions and a gradual increase of the product.\r\n  The total mineral product in 1906, according to the State Mine\r\n  Inspector, was valued at $24,138,317. The total gold production of\r\n  Idaho from 1860 to 1906 has been estimated at $250,000,000, of which a\r\n  large part was produced in the Idaho Basin, the region lying between\r\n  the N. fork of the Boisé and the S. fork of the Payette rivers. In\r\n  1901-1902 rich gold deposits were discovered in the Thunder Mountain\r\n  district in Idaho county. The counties with the largest production of\r\n  gold in 1907 (state report) were Owyhee ($362,742), Boisé ($282,444),\r\n  Custer ($210,900) and Idaho; the total for the state was $1,075,618 in\r\n  1905; in 1906 it was $1,149,100; and in 1907, according to state\r\n  reports, $1,373,031. The total of the state for silver in 1905 was\r\n  $5,242,172; in 1906 it was $6,042,606; in 1907, according to state\r\n  reports, it was $5,546,554. The richest deposits of silver are those\r\n  of Wood river and of the Coeur d'Alene district in Shoshone county\r\n  (opened up in 1886); the county's product in 1906 was valued at\r\n  $5,322,706, an increase of $917,743 over the preceding year; in 1907\r\n  it was $4,780,093, according to state reports. The production of the\r\n  next richest county, Owyhee, in 1907, was less than one tenth that of\r\n  Shoshone county, which yields, besides, about one half of the lead\r\n  mined in the United States, its product of lead being valued at\r\n  $9,851,076 in 1904, at $14,365,265 in 1906, and at $12,232,233 (state\r\n  report) in 1907. Idaho was the first of the states in its output of\r\n  lead from 1896, when it first passed Colorado in rank, to 1906,\r\n  excepting the year 1899, when Colorado again was first; the value of\r\n  the lead mined in 1906 was $14,535,823, and of that mined in 1907\r\n  (state report), $12,470,375. High grade copper ores have been produced\r\n  in the Seven Devils and Washington districts of Washington county;\r\n  there are deposits, little developed up to 1906, in Lemhi county\r\n  (which was almost inaccessible by railway) and in Bannock county; the\r\n  copper mined in 1905 was valued at $1,134,846, and in 1907, according\r\n  to state reports, at $2,241,177, of which about two-thirds was the\r\n  output of the Coeur d'Alene district in Shoshone county. Zinc occurs\r\n  in the Coeur d'Alene district, at Hailey, Blaine county and elsewhere;\r\n  according to the state reports, the state's output in 1906 was valued\r\n  at $91,426 and in 1907 at $534,087. Other minerals of economic value\r\n  are sandstone, quarried at Boisé, Ada county, at Preston, Oneida\r\n  county, and at Goshen, Prospect and Idaho Falls, Bingham county,\r\n  valued at $22,265 in 1905, and at $11,969 in 1906; limestone, valued\r\n  at $14,105 in 1905 and at $12,600 in 1906, used entirely for the local\r\n  manufacture of lime, part of which was used in the manufacture of\r\n  sugar; and coal, in the Horseshoe Bend and Jerusalem districts in\r\n  Boisé county, in Lemhi county near Salmon City, and in E. Bingham and\r\n  Fremont counties, with an output in 1906 of 5365 tons, valued at\r\n  $18,538 as compared with 20 and 10 tons respectively in 1899 and 1900.\r\n  Minerals developed slightly, or not at all, are granite, valued at\r\n  $1500 in 1905; surface salt, in the arid and semi-arid regions; nickel\r\n  and cobalt, in Lemhi county; tungsten, near Murray, Shoshone county;\r\n  monazite and zircon, in certain sands; and some pumice.\r\n\r\n  _Manufactures._--The manufactures of Idaho in 1900 were relatively\r\n  unimportant, the value of all products of establishments under the\r\n  \"factory system\" being $3,001,442; in 1905 the value of such\r\n  manufactured products had increased 192.2%, to $8,768,743. The\r\n  manufacturing establishments were limited to the supply of local\r\n  demands. The principal industries were devoted to lumber and timber\r\n  products, valued at $908,670 in 1900, and in 1905 at $2,834,506,\r\n  211.9% more. In 1906 the Weyerhauser Syndicate built at Potlatch, a\r\n  town built by the syndicate in Latah county, a lumber mill, supposed\r\n  to be the largest in the United States, with a daily capacity of\r\n  750,000 ft. In Bonner county there are great mills at Sand Point and\r\n  at Bonner's Ferry. In these and the other 93 saw-mills in the state in\r\n  1905 steam generated by the waste wood was the common power. The raw\r\n  material for these products was secured from the 35,000 sq. m. of\r\n  timber land in the state (6164 sq. m. having been reserved up to 1905,\r\n  and 31,775.7 sq. m. up to April 1907 by the United States government);\r\n  four-fifths of the cut in 1900 was yellow pine. Flour and grist mill\r\n  products ranked second among the manufactures, being valued at\r\n  $1,584,473 in 1905, an increase of nearly 116% over the product in\r\n  1900; and steam-car construction and repairs ranked third, with a\r\n  value of $913,670 in 1905 and $523,631 in 1900. In 1903-1904 the\r\n  cultivation of sugar beets and the manufacture of beet sugar were\r\n  undertaken, and manufacturing establishments for that purpose were\r\n  installed at Idaho Falls and Blackfoot (Bingham county), at Sugar, or\r\n  Sugar City (Fremont county), a place built up about the sugar\r\n  refineries, and at Nampa, Canyon county. In 1906 between 57,000,000\r\n  and 64,000,000 lb. of beet sugar were refined in the state.\r\n  Brick-making was of little more than local importance in 1906, the\r\n  largest kilns being at Boisé, Sand Point and Coeur d'Alene City. Lime\r\n  is made at Orofino, Shoshone county, and at Hope, Bonner county.\r\n\r\n  _Communications._--The total railway mileage in January 1909 was\r\n  2,022.04 m., an increase from 206 m. in 1880 and 946 m. in 1890. The\r\n  Great Northern, the Northern Pacific, and the Oregon Railway &\r\n  Navigation lines cross the N. part of the state; the Oregon Short Line\r\n  crosses the S., and the Union Pacific, which owns the Oregon Railway &\r\n  Navigation and the Oregon Short Line roads, crosses the eastern part.\r\n  The constitution declares that railways are public highways, that the\r\n  legislature has authority to regulate rates, and that discrimination\r\n  in tolls shall not be allowed.\r\n\r\n_Population._--The population of Idaho in 1870 was 14,999; in 1880 it\r\nwas 32,610, an increase of 117.4%; in 1890 it was 88,548, an increase of\r\n158.8%; in 1900 161,772 (82.7% increase); and in 1910 325,594 (101.3%\r\nincrease). Of the inhabitants 15.2% were in 1900 foreign-born and 4.5%\r\nwere coloured, the coloured population consisting of 293 negroes, 1291\r\nJapanese, 1467 Chinese and 4226 Indians. The Indians lived principally\r\nin three reservations, the Fort Hall and Lemhi reservations (1350 sq. m.\r\nand 100 sq. m. respectively), in S.E. and E. Idaho, being occupied by\r\nthe Shoshone, Bannock and Sheef-eater tribes, and the Coeur d'Alene\r\nreservation (632 sq. m.), in the N.W., by the Coeur d'Alene and Spokane\r\ntribes. The former Nez Perce reservation, in the N.W. part of the state,\r\nwas abolished in 1895, and the Nez Perces were put under the supervision\r\nof the superintendent of the Indian School at Fort Lapwai, about 12 m.\r\nE. of Lewiston, in Nez Perce county. Of these tribes, the Nez Perce and\r\nCoeur d'Alene were self-supporting; the other tribes were in 1900\r\ndependent upon the United States government for 30% of their rations. Of\r\nthe 24,604 foreign-born inhabitants of the state, 3943 were from\r\nEngland, 2974 were from Germany, 2528 were Canadian English, 2822 were\r\nfrom Sweden, and 1633 were from Ireland, various other countries being\r\nrepresented by smaller numbers. The urban population of Idaho in 1900\r\n(i.e. the population of places having 4000 or more inhabitants) was 6.2%\r\nof the whole. There were thirty-three incorporated cities, towns and\r\nvillages, but only five had a population exceeding 2000; these were\r\nBoisé (5957), Pocatello (4046), Lewiston (2425), Moscow (2484) and\r\nWallace (2265). In 1906 it was estimated that the total membership of\r\nall religious denominations was 74,578, and that there were 32,425\r\nLatter-Day Saints or Mormons (266 of the Reorganized Church), 18,057\r\nRoman Catholics, 5884 Methodist Episcopalians (5313 of the Northern\r\nChurch), 3770 Presbyterians (3698 of the Northern Church), 3206\r\nDisciples of Christ, and 2374 Baptists (2331 of the Northern\r\nConvention).\r\n\r\n_Government._--The present constitution of Idaho was adopted in 1889.\r\nThe government is similar in outline to that of the other states of the\r\nUnited States. The executive officials serve for a term of two years.\r\nBesides being citizens of the United States and residents of the state\r\nfor two years preceding their election the governor, lieutenant-governor\r\nand attorney-general must each be at least thirty years of age, and the\r\nsecretary of state, state auditor, treasurer and superintendent of\r\neducation must be at least twenty-five years old. The governor's veto\r\nmay be overridden by a two-thirds vote of the legislature; the governor,\r\nsecretary of state, and the attorney-general constitute a Board of\r\nPardons and a Board of State Prison Commissioners. The legislature meets\r\nbiennially; its members, who must be citizens of the United States and\r\nelectors of the state for one year preceding their election, are chosen\r\nbiennially; the number of senators may never exceed twenty-four, that of\r\nrepresentatives sixty; each county is entitled to at least one\r\nrepresentative. The judiciary consists of a supreme court of three\r\njudges, elected every six years, and circuit and probate courts, the\r\nfive district judges being elected every four years. Suffrage\r\nrequirements are citizenship in the United States, registration and\r\nresidence in the state for six months and in the county for thirty days\r\nimmediately before election, but mental deficiency, conviction of\r\ninfamous crimes (without restoration to rights of citizenship), bribery\r\nor attempt at bribery, bigamy, living in \"what is known as patriarchal,\r\nplural or celestial marriage,\" or teaching its validity or belonging to\r\nany organization which teaches polygamy,[2] are disqualifications.\r\nChinese or persons of Mongolian descent not born in the United States\r\nare also excluded from suffrage rights. Women, however, since 1897, have\r\nhad the right to vote and to hold office, and they are subject to jury\r\nservice. An Australian ballot law was passed in 1891. The constitution\r\nforbids the chartering of corporations except according to general laws.\r\nIn 1909 a direct primary elections law was passed which required a\r\nmajority of all votes to nominate, and, to make a majority possible,\r\nprovided for preferential (or second-choice) voting, such votes to be\r\ncanvassed and added to the first-choice vote for each candidate if there\r\nbe no majority by the first-choice vote. The right of eminent domain\r\nover all corporations is reserved to the state; and no corporation may\r\nissue stock except for labour, service rendered, or money paid in. The\r\nwaters of the state are, by the constitution of the state, devoted to\r\nthe public use, contrary to the common law theory of riparian rights. By\r\nstatute (1891) it has been provided that in civil actions three-fourths\r\nof a jury may render a verdict, and in misdemeanour cases five-sixths\r\nmay give a verdict. Life insurance agents not residents of Idaho cannot\r\nwrite policies in the state. Divorces may be obtained after residence of\r\nsix months on the ground of adultery, cruelty, desertion or neglect for\r\none year, habitual drunkenness for the same period, felony or insanity.\r\nThere are a state penitentiary at Boisé, an Industrial Training School\r\nat St Anthony, an Insane Asylum at Blackfoot, and a North Idaho Insane\r\nAsylum at Orofino. The care of all defectives was let by contract to\r\nother states until 1906, when a state school for the deaf and blind was\r\nopened in Boisé. No bureau of charities is in existence, but there is a\r\nLabor Commission, and a Commissioner of Immigration and a Commissioner\r\nof Public Lands to investigate the industrial resources. The offices of\r\nState Engineer and Inspector of Mines have been created.\r\n\r\n  _Education._--The public schools in 1905-1906 had an enrolment of\r\n  62,726, or 81.5% of the population between 5 and 21 years of age. The\r\n  average length of school term was 6-8 months, the average expenditure\r\n  (year ending Aug. 31, 1906) for instruction for each child was $19.29,\r\n  and the expenditure for all school purposes was $1,008,481. There was\r\n  a compulsory attendance law, which, however, was not enforced. Higher\r\n  education is provided by the University of Idaho, established in 1899\r\n  at Moscow, Latah county, which confers degrees in arts, science, music\r\n  and engineering, and offers free tuition. In 1907-1908 the institution\r\n  had 41 instructors and 426 regular and 58 special students. In 1901\r\n  the Academy of Idaho, another state institution with industrial and\r\n  technical courses and a preparatory department, was established at\r\n  Pocatello, Bannock county, to be a connecting link between the public\r\n  schools and the university. There are two state normal schools, one at\r\n  Lewiston and the other at Albion. The only private institution of\r\n  college rank in 1908 was the College of Caldwell (Presbyterian, opened\r\n  1891) at Caldwell, Canyon county, with 65 students in 1906-1907. There\r\n  are Catholic academies at Boisé and Coeur d'Alene and a convent, Our\r\n  Lady of Lourdes, at Wallace, Shoshone county, opened in 1905; Mormon\r\n  schools at Paris (Bear Lake county), Preston (Oneida county), Rexburg\r\n  (Fremont county), and Oakley (Cassia county); a Methodist Episcopal\r\n  school (1906) at Weiser (Washington county); and a Protestant\r\n  Episcopal school at Boisé (1892). The Idaho Industrial Institute\r\n  (non-denominational; incorporated in 1899) is at Weiser.\r\n\r\n  _Finance._--The finances of Idaho are in excellent condition. The\r\n  bonded debt on the 30th of September 1908 was $1,364,000. The revenue\r\n  system is based on the general property tax and there is a State Board\r\n  of Equalization. Each year $100,000 is set aside for the sinking fund\r\n  for the payment of outstanding bonds as fast as they become due. The\r\n  constitution provides that the rate of taxation shall never exceed 10\r\n  mills for each dollar of assessed valuation, that when the taxable\r\n  property amounts to $50,000,000 the rate shall not exceed 5 mills,\r\n  when it reaches $100,000,000, 3 mills shall be the limit, and when it\r\n  reaches $300,000,000 the rate shall not exceed 1½ mills; but a greater\r\n  rate may be established by a vote of the people. No public debt\r\n  (exclusive of the debt of the Territory of Idaho at the date of its\r\n  admission to the Union as a state) may be created that exceeds 1½% of\r\n  the assessed valuation (except in case of war, &c.); the state cannot\r\n  lend its credit to any corporation, municipality or individual; nor\r\n  can any county, city or town lend its credit or become a stockholder\r\n  in any company (except for municipal works).\r\n\r\n_History._--The first recorded exploration of Idaho by white men was\r\nmade by Lewis and Clark, who passed along the Snake river to its\r\njunction with the Columbia; in 1805 the site of Fort Lemhi in Lemhi\r\ncounty was a rendezvous for two divisions of the Lewis and Clark\r\nexpedition; later, the united divisions reached a village of the Nez\r\nPerce Indians near the south fork of the Clearwater river, where they\r\nfound traces of visits by other white men. In 1810 Fort Henry, on the\r\nSnake river, was established by the Missouri Fur Company, and in the\r\nfollowing year a party under the auspices of the Pacific Fur Company\r\ndescended the Snake river to the Columbia. In 1834 Fort Hall in E. Idaho\r\n(Bingham county) was founded. It acquired prominence as the\r\nmeeting-point of a number of trails to the extreme western parts of\r\nNorth America. Missions to the Indians were also established, both by\r\nthe Catholics and by the Protestants. But the permanent settlements date\r\nfrom the revelation of Idaho's mineral resources in 1860, when the Coeur\r\nd'Alene, Palouses and Nez Perces were in the North, and the Blackfoots,\r\nBannocks and Shoshones in the South. While trading with these Indians,\r\nCapt. Pierce learned in the summer of 1860 that there was gold in Idaho.\r\nHe found it on Orofino Creek, and a great influx followed--coming to\r\nOrofino, Newsome, Elk City, Florence, where the ore was especially rich,\r\nand Warren. The news of the discovery of the Boisé Basin spread far and\r\nwide, and Idaho City, Placerville, Buena Vista, Centreville and\r\nPioneerville grew up. The territory now constituting Idaho was comprised\r\nin the Territory of Oregon from 1848 to 1853; from 1853 to 1859 the\r\nsouthern portion of the present state was a part of Oregon, the northern\r\na part of Washington Territory; from 1859 to 1863 the territory was\r\nwithin the bounds of Washington Territory. In 1863 the Territory of\r\nIdaho was organized; it included Montana until 1864, and a part of\r\nWyoming until 1868, when the area of the Territory of Idaho was\r\npractically the same as that of the present state. Idaho was admitted\r\ninto the Union as a state in 1890. There have been a few serious Indian\r\noutbreaks in Idaho. In 1856 the Coeur d'Alenes, Palouses and Spokanes\r\nwent on the war-path; in April 1857 they put to flight a small force\r\nunder Col. Edward Tenner Steptoe; but the punitive expedition led by\r\nCol. George Wright (1803-1865) was a success. In 1877 the Nez Perces,\r\nled by Chief Joseph, refused to go on the reservation set apart for\r\nthem, defeated a small body of regulars, were pursued by Major-General\r\nO. O. Howard, reinforced by frontier volunteers, and in September and\r\nOctober were defeated and retreated into Northern Montana, where they\r\nwere captured by Major-General Nelson A. Miles. Occasional labour\r\ntroubles have been very severe in the Coeur d'Alene region, where the\r\nattempt in 1892 of the Mine Owners' Association to discriminate in wages\r\nbetween miners and surfacemen brought on a union strike. Rioting\r\nfollowed the introduction of non-union men, the Frisco Mill was blown\r\nup, and many non-union miners were killed. The militia was called out\r\nand regular troops were hurried to Shoshone county from Fort Sherman,\r\nIdaho and Fort Missoula, Montana. These soon quieted the district. But\r\nthe restlessness of the region caused more trouble in 1899. The famous\r\nBunker Hill and Sullivan mines were wrecked, late in April, by union\r\nmen. Federal troops, called for by Governor Frank Steunenberg, again\r\ntook charge, and about 800 suspected men in the district were arrested\r\nand shut up in a stockade known as the \"bull-pen.\" Ten prisoners,\r\nconvicted of destroying the property of the mine-owners, were sentenced\r\nto twenty-two months in jail. The feeling among the union men was bitter\r\nagainst Steunenberg, who was assassinated on the 30th of December 1905.\r\nThe trial in 1907 of Charles H. Haywood, secretary of the Western\r\nFederation of Miners, who was charged with conspiracy in connexion with\r\nthe murder, attracted national attention; it resulted in Haywood's\r\nacquittal. Before 1897 the administration of the state was controlled by\r\nthe Republican party; but in 1896 Democrats, Populists and those\r\nRepublicans who believed in free coinage of silver united, and until\r\n1902 elected a majority of all candidates for state offices. In 1902,\r\n1904, 1906 and 1908 a Republican state ticket was elected.\r\n\r\nGOVERNORS\r\n\r\n  _Territorial._\r\n\r\n  William H. Wallace                              1863\r\n  W. B.

Onderdonk's _Idaho: Facts and Statistics_ (San\r\n  Francisco, 1885), Israel C. Russell's \"Geology and Water Resources of\r\n  the Snake River Plains of Idaho,\" _U.S. Geological Survey, Bulletin\r\n  199_ (Washington, 1902), _The State of Idaho_ (a pamphlet issued by\r\n  the State Commissioner of Immigration), Waldmor Lindgren's \"Gold and\r\n  Silver Veins of Silver City, De Lamar and other Mining Districts of\r\n  Idaho,\" _U.S. Geological Survey, 20th Annual Report_ (Washington,\r\n  1900), and \"The Mining Districts of the Idaho Basin and the Boisé\r\n  Ridge, Idaho,\" _U.S. Geological Survey, 18th Annual Report_\r\n  (Washington, 1898). These reports should be supplemented by the\r\n  information contained elsewhere in the publications of the Geological\r\n  Survey (see the Indexes of the survey) and in various volumes of the\r\n  United States Census. W. B. Hepburn's _Idaho Laws and Decisions,\r\n  Annotated and Digested_ (Boisé, 1900), and H. H. Bancroft's\r\n  _Washington, Idaho, and Montana_ (San Francisco, 1890) are the\r\n  principal authorities for administration and history. The reports of\r\n  the state's various executive officers should be consulted also.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [1] Of these 80,000 acres are reached directly--72,000 N., and 8000\r\n    S. of the Snake river; and from 50,000 to 70,000 acres more are above\r\n    the level of the canals and will have water pumped to them by the\r\n    11,000-30,000 h.p. developed.\r\n\r\n  [2] This disqualification and much other legislation were due to the\r\n    large Mormon population in Idaho. In 1884-1885 all county and\r\n    precinct officers were required to take a test oath abjuring bigamy,\r\n    polygamy, or celestial marriage; and under this law in 1888 three\r\n    members of the territorial legislature were deprived of their seats\r\n    as ineligible. An act of 1889, when the Mormons constituted over 20%\r\n    of the population, forbade in the case of any who had since the 1st\r\n    of January 1888 practised, taught, aided or encouraged polygamy or\r\n    bigamy, their registration or voting until two years after they had\r\n    taken a test oath renouncing such practices, and until they had\r\n    satisfied the District Court that in the two years preceding they had\r\n    been guilty of no such practices. The Constitutional Convention which\r\n    met at Boisé in July-August 1889 was strongly anti-Mormon, and the\r\n    Constitution it framed was approved by a popular vote of 12,398 out\r\n    of 14,184. The United States Supreme Court decided the anti-Mormon\r\n    legislation case of Davis v. Beason in favour of the Idaho\r\n    legislature. In 1893 the disqualification was made no longer\r\n    retroactive, the two-year clause was omitted, and the test oath\r\n    covered only present renunciation of polygamy.\r\n\r\n  [3] Governor Shoup resigned in December to take his seat in the U.S.\r\n    Senate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIDAR, or EDAR, a native state of India, forming part of the Mahi Kantha\r\nagency, within the Gujarat division of Bombay. It has an area of 1669\r\nsq. m., and a population (1901) of 168,557, showing a decrease of 44% in\r\nthe decade as the result of famine. Estimated gross revenue, £29,000;\r\ntribute to the gaekwar of Baroda, £2000. In 1901 the raja and his\r\nposthumous son both died, and the succession devolved upon Sir Pertab\r\nSingh (q.v.) of Jodhpur. The line of railway from Ahmedabad through\r\nParantij runs mainly through this state. Much of the territory is held\r\nby kinsmen of the raja on feudal tenure. The products are grain,\r\noil-seeds and sugar-cane. The town of Idar is 64 m. N.E. of Ahmedabad.\r\nPop. (1901) 7085. It was formerly the capital, but Ahmednagar (pop.\r\n3200) is the present capital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIDAS, in Greek legend, son of Aphareus of the royal house of Messene,\r\nbrother of Lynceus. He is only mentioned in a single passage in Homer\r\n(_Iliad_, ix. 556 sqq.), where he is called the strongest of men on\r\nearth. He carried off Marpessa, daughter of Evenus, as his wife and\r\ndared to bend his bow against Apollo, who was also her suitor. Zeus\r\nintervened, and left the choice to Marpessa, who declared in favour of\r\nIdas, fearing that the god might desert her when she grew old\r\n(Apollodorus i. 7). The Apharetidae are best known for their fight with\r\nthe Dioscuri. A quarrel had arisen about the division of a herd of\r\ncattle which the four had stolen. Idas claimed the whole of the booty as\r\nthe victor in a contest of eating, and drove the cattle off to Messene.\r\nThe Dioscuri overtook him and lay in wait in a hollow oak. But Lynceus,\r\nwhose keenness of sight was proverbial, saw Castor through the trunk and\r\nwarned his brother, who thereupon slew the mortal Castor; finally,\r\nPollux slew Lynceus, and Idas was struck by lightning (Apollodorus iii.\r\n11; Pindar, _Nem._, x. 60; Pausanias iv. 3. 1). According to others, the\r\nDioscuri had carried off the daughters of Leucippus, who had been\r\nbetrothed to the Apharetidae (Ovid, _Fasti_, v. 699; Theocritus xxii.\r\n137). The scene of the combat is placed near the grave of Aphareus at\r\nMessene, at Aphidna in Attica, or in Laconia; and there are other\r\nvariations of detail in the accounts (see also Hyginus, _Fab._ 80). Idas\r\nand Lynceus were originally gods of light, probably the sun and moon,\r\nthe herd of cattle (for the possession of which they strove with the\r\nDioscuri) representing the heavenly bodies. The annihilation of the\r\nApharetidae in the legend indicates the subordinate position held by the\r\nMessenians after the loss of their independence and subjugation by\r\nSparta, the Dioscuri being distinctly Spartan, as the Apharetidae were\r\nMessenian heroes. The grave of Idas and Lynceus was shown at Sparta,\r\naccording to Pausanias (iii. 13. 1), whose own opinion, however, is that\r\nthey were buried in Messenia. On the chest of Cypselus, Marpessa is\r\nrepresented as following Idas from the temple of Apollo (by whom,\r\naccording to some, she had been carried off), and there was a painting\r\nby Polygnotus of the rape of the Leucippidae in the temple of the\r\nDioscuri at Athens.\r\n\r\n  In the article GREEK ART, fig. 66 (Pl. iv.) represents Idas and the\r\n  Dioscuri driving off cattle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIDDESLEIGH, STAFFORD HENRY NORTHCOTE, 1ST EARL OF (1818-1887), British\r\nstatesman, was born in London, on the 27th of October 1818. His\r\nancestors had long been settled in Devonshire, their pedigree, according\r\nto Burke, being traceable to the beginning of the 12th century. After a\r\nsuccessful career at Balliol College, Oxford, he became in 1843 private\r\nsecretary to Mr Gladstone at the board of trade. He was afterwards legal\r\nsecretary to the board; and after acting as one of the secretaries to\r\nthe Great Exhibition of 1851, co-operated with Sir Charles Trevelyan in\r\nframing the report which revolutionized the conditions of appointment to\r\nthe Civil Service. He succeeded his grandfather, Sir Stafford Henry\r\nNorthcote, as 8th baronet in 1851. He entered Parliament in 1855 as\r\nConservative M.P. for Dudley, and was elected for Stamford in 1858, a\r\nseat which he exchanged in 1866 for North Devon. Steadily supporting his\r\nparty, he became president of the board of trade in 1866, secretary of\r\nstate for India in 1867, and chancellor of the exchequer in 1874. In the\r\ninterval between these last two appointments he had been one of the\r\ncommissioners for the settlement of the \"Alabama\" difficulty with the\r\nUnited States, and on Mr Disraeli's elevation to the House of Lords in\r\n1876 he became leader of the Conservative party in the Commons. As a\r\nfinance minister he was largely dominated by the lines of policy laid\r\ndown by Mr Gladstone; but he distinguished himself by his dealings with\r\nthe Debt, especially his introduction of the New Sinking Fund (1876), by\r\nwhich he fixed the annual charge for the Debt in such a way as to\r\nprovide for a regular series of payments off the capital. His temper as\r\nleader was, however, too gentle to satisfy the more ardent spirits among\r\nhis own followers, and party cabals (in which Lord Randolph\r\nChurchill--who had made a dead set at the \"old gang,\" and especially Sir\r\nStafford Northcote--took a leading part) led to Sir Stafford's transfer\r\nto the Lords in 1885, when Lord Salisbury became prime minister. Taking\r\nthe titles of earl of Iddesleigh and Viscount St Cyres, he was included\r\nin the cabinet as first lord of the treasury. In Lord Salisbury's 1886\r\nministry he became secretary of state for foreign affairs, but the\r\narrangement was not a comfortable one, and his resignation had just been\r\ndecided upon when on the 12th of January 1887 he died very suddenly at\r\nLord Salisbury's official residence in Downing Street. Lord Iddesleigh\r\nwas elected lord rector of Edinburgh University in 1883, in which\r\ncapacity he addressed the students on the subject of \"Desultory\r\nReading.\" He had little leisure for letters, but amongst his works were\r\n_Twenty Years of Financial Policy_ (1862), a valuable study of\r\nGladstonian finance, and _Lectures and Essays_ (1887). His _Life_ by\r\nAndrew Lang appeared in 1890. Lord Iddesleigh married in 1843 Cecilia\r\nFrances Farrer (d. 1910) (sister of Thomas, 1st Lord Farrer), by whom he\r\nhad seven sons and three daughters.\r\n\r\nHe was succeeded as 2nd earl by his eldest son, WALTER STAFFORD\r\nNORTHCOTE (1845-   ), who for some years was his father's private\r\nsecretary. He was chairman of the Inland Revenue Board from 1877 to\r\n1892; and is also known as a novelist. His eldest son STAFFORD HENRY\r\nNORTHCOTE, Viscount St Cyres (1869-   ), was educated at Eton and Merton\r\nCollege Oxford. After taking a 1st class in History, he was elected a\r\nsenior student of Christ Church, where he resided for a while as tutor\r\nand lecturer. His interest in the development of religious thought led\r\nhim to devote himself specially to the history of the Roman Catholic\r\nChurch in the 17th century, the first-fruits of which was his _François\r\nde Fénelon_ (London, 1901); eight years later he published his _Pascal_\r\n(ib. 1909).\r\n\r\nThe second son of the 1st earl of Iddesleigh, STAFFORD HENRY NORTHCOTE,\r\n1st Baron Northcote (b. 1846), was educated at Eton and at Merton\r\nCollege, Oxford. He became a clerk in the foreign office in 1868, acted\r\nas private secretary to Lord Salisbury, and was attached to the embassy\r\nat Constantinople from 1876 to 1877. From 1877 to 1880 he was secretary\r\nto the chancellor of the exchequer, was financial secretary to the war\r\noffice from 1885 to 1886, surveyor-general of ordnance, 1886 to 1887,\r\nand charity commissioner, 1891 to 1892. In 1887 he was created a\r\nbaronet. In 1880 he was elected M.P. for Exeter as a Conservative, and\r\nretained the seat until 1899, when he was appointed governor of Bombay\r\n(1899-1903), being created a peer in 1900. Lord Northcote was appointed\r\ngovernor-general of the Commonwealth of Australia in 1903, and held this\r\npost till 1908. He married in 1873 Alice, adopted daughter of the 1st\r\nLord Mount Stephen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIDEA (Gr. [Greek: idea], connected with [Greek: idein], to see; cf. Lat.\r\n_species_ from _specere_, to look at), a term used both popularly and in\r\nphilosophical terminology with the general sense of \"mental picture.\" To\r\nhave no _idea_ how a thing happened is to be without a mental picture of\r\nan occurrence. In this general sense it is synonymous with concept\r\n(q.v.) in its popular usage. In philosophy the term \"idea\" is common to\r\nall languages and periods, but there is scarcely any term which has been\r\nused with so many different shades of meaning. Plato used it in the\r\nsphere of metaphysics for the eternally existing reality, the archetype,\r\nof which the objects of sense are more or less imperfect copies. Chairs\r\nmay be of different forms, sizes, colours and so forth, but \"laid up in\r\nthe mind of God\" there is the one permanent _idea_ or type, of which the\r\nmany physical chairs are derived with various degrees of imperfection.\r\nFrom this doctrine it follows that these _ideas_ are the sole reality\r\n(see further IDEALISM); in opposition to it are the empirical thinkers\r\nof all time who find reality in particular physical objects (see\r\nHYLOZOISM, EMPIRICISM, &c.). In striking contrast to Plato's use is that\r\nof John Locke, who defines \"idea\" as \"whatever is the object of\r\nunderstanding when a man thinks\" (_Essay on the Human Understanding_\r\n(I.), vi. 8). Here the term is applied not to the mental process, but to\r\nanything whether physical or intellectual which is the object of it.\r\nHume differs from Locke by limiting \"idea\" to the more or less vague\r\nmental reconstructions of perceptions, the perceptual process being\r\ndescribed as an \"impression.\" Wundt widens the term to include\r\n\"conscious representation of some object or process of the external\r\nworld.\" In so doing he includes not only ideas of memory and\r\nimagination, but also perceptual processes, whereas other psychologists\r\nconfine the term to the first two groups. G. F. Stout and J. M. Baldwin,\r\nin the _Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology_, i. 498, define \"idea\"\r\nas \"the reproduction with a more or less adequate image, of an object\r\nnot actually present to the senses.\" They point out that an idea and a\r\nperception are by various authorities contrasted in various ways.\r\n\"Difference in degree of intensity,\" \"comparative absence of bodily\r\nmovement on the part of the subject,\" \"comparative dependence on mental\r\nactivity,\" are suggested by psychologists as characteristic of an idea\r\nas compared with a perception.\r\n\r\nIt should be observed that an idea, in the narrower and generally\r\naccepted sense of a mental reproduction, is frequently composite. That\r\nis, as in the example given above of the idea of chair, a great many\r\nobjects, differing materially in detail, all call a single idea. When a\r\nman, for example, has obtained an idea of chairs in general by\r\ncomparison with which he can say \"This is a chair, that is a stool,\" he\r\nhas what is known as an \"abstract idea\" distinct from the reproduction\r\nin his mind of any particular chair (see ABSTRACTION). Furthermore a\r\ncomplex idea may not have any corresponding physical object, though its\r\nparticular constituent elements may severally be the reproductions of\r\nactual perceptions. Thus the idea of a centaur is a complex mental\r\npicture composed of the ideas of man and horse, that of a mermaid of a\r\nwoman and a fish.\r\n\r\n  See PSYCHOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIDEALISM (from Gr. [Greek: idea], archetype or model, through Fr.\r\n_idéalisme_), a term generally used for the attitude of mind which is\r\nprone to represent things in an imaginative light and to lay emphasis\r\nexclusively or primarily on abstract perfection (i.e. in \"ideals\"). With\r\nthis meaning the philosophical use of the term has little in common.\r\n\r\nTo understand the philosophical theory that has come to be known under\r\nthis title, we may ask (1) what in general it is and how it is\r\ndifferentiated from other theories of knowledge and reality, (2) how it\r\nhas risen in the history of philosophy, (3) what position it occupies at\r\npresent in the world of speculation.\r\n\r\n1. _General Definition of Idealism._--Idealism as a philosophical\r\ndoctrine conceives of knowledge or experience as a process in which the\r\ntwo factors of subject and object stand in a relation of entire\r\ninterdependence on each other as warp and woof. Apart from the activity\r\nof the self or subject in sensory reaction, memory and association,\r\nimagination, judgment and inference, there can be no world of objects. A\r\nthing-in-itself which is not a thing to some consciousness is an\r\nentirely unrealizable, because self-contradictory, conception. But this\r\nis only one side of the truth. It is equally true that a subject apart\r\nfrom an object is unintelligible. As the object exists through the\r\nconstructive activity of the subject, so the subject lives in the\r\nconstruction of the object. To seek for the true self in any region into\r\nwhich its opposite in the form of a not-self does not enter is to grasp\r\na shadow. It is in seeking to realize its own ideas in the world of\r\nknowledge, feeling and action that the mind comes into possession of\r\nitself; it is in becoming permeated and transformed by the mind's ideas\r\nthat the world develops the fullness of its reality as object.\r\n\r\nThus defined, idealism is opposed to ordinary common-sense dualism,\r\nwhich regards knowledge or experience as the result of the more or less\r\naccidental relation between two separate and independent entities--the\r\nmind and its ideas on one side, the thing with its attributes on the\r\nother--that serve to limit and condition each other from without. It is\r\nequally opposed to the doctrine which represents the subject itself and\r\nits state and judgments as the single immediate datum of consciousness,\r\nand all else, whether the objects of an external world or person other\r\nthan the individual subject whose states are known to itself, as having\r\na merely problematic existence resting upon analogy or other process of\r\nindirect inference. This theory is sometimes known as idealism. But it\r\nfalls short of idealism as above defined in that it recognizes only one\r\nside of the antithesis of subject and object, and so falls short of the\r\ndoctrine which takes its stand on the complete correlativity of the two\r\nfactors in experience. It is for this reason that it is sometimes known\r\nas subjective or incomplete idealism. Finally the theory defined is\r\nopposed to all forms of realism, whether in the older form which sought\r\nto reduce mind to a function of matter, or in any of the newer forms\r\nwhich seek for the ultimate essence of both mind and matter in some\r\nunknown force or energy which, while in itself it is neither, yet\r\ncontains the potentiality of both. It is true that in some modern\r\ndevelopments of idealism the ultimate reality is conceived of in an\r\nimpersonal way, but it is usually added that this ultimate or absolute\r\nbeing is not something lower but higher than self-conscious personality,\r\nincluding it as a more fully developed form may be said to include a\r\nmore elementary.\r\n\r\n2. _Origin and Development of Idealism._--In its self-conscious form\r\nidealism is a modern doctrine. In it the self or subject may be said to\r\nhave come to its rights. This was possible in any complete sense only\r\nafter the introspective movement represented by the middle ages had done\r\nits work, and the thought of the individual mind and will as possessed\r\nof relative independence had worked itself out into some degree of\r\nclearness. In this respect Descartes' dictum--_cogito ergo sum_--may be\r\nsaid to have struck the keynote of modern philosophy, and all subsequent\r\nspeculation to have been merely a prolonged commentary upon it. While in\r\nits completer form it is thus a doctrine distinctive of modern times,\r\nidealism has its roots far back in the history of thought. One of the\r\nchief proofs that has been urged of the truth of its point of view is\r\nthe persistency with which it has always asserted itself at a certain\r\nstage in philosophical reflection and as the solution of certain\r\nrecurrent speculative difficulties. All thought starts from the ordinary\r\ndualism or pluralism which conceives of the world as consisting of the\r\njuxtaposition of mutually independent things and persons. The first\r\nmovement is in the direction of dispelling this appearance of\r\nindependence. They are seen to be united under the relation of cause and\r\neffect, determining and determined, which turns out to mean that they\r\nare merely passing manifestations of some single entity or energy which\r\nconstitutes the real unknown essence of the things that come before our\r\nknowledge. In the pantheism that thus takes the place of the old dualism\r\nthere seems no place left for the individual. Mind and will in their\r\nindividual manifestations fade into the general background of appearance\r\nwithout significance except as a link in a fated chain. Deliverance from\r\nthe pantheistic conception of the universe comes through the recognition\r\nof the central place occupied by thought and purpose in the actual\r\nworld, and, as a consequence of this, of the illegitimacy of the\r\nabstraction whereby material energy is taken for the ultimate reality.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ancient idealism: Socrates.\r\n\r\n  Plato\r\n\r\nThe first illustration of this movement on a large scale was given in\r\nthe Socratic reaction against the pantheistic conclusions of early Greek\r\nphilosophy (see IONIAN SCHOOL). The whole movement of which Socrates was\r\na part may be said to have been in the direction of the assertion of the\r\nrights of the subject. Its keynote is to be found in the Protagorean\r\n\"man is the measure.\" This seems to have been interpreted by its author\r\nand by the Sophists in general in a subjective sense, with the result\r\nthat it became the motto of a sceptical and individualistic movement in\r\ncontemporary philosophy and ethics. It was not less against this form of\r\nidealism than against the determinism of the early physicists that\r\nSocrates protested. Along two lines the thought of Socrates led to\r\nidealistic conclusions which may be said to have formed the basis of all\r\nsubsequent advance. (1) He perceived the importance of the universal or\r\nconceptual element in knowledge, and thus at a single stroke broke\r\nthrough the hard realism of ordinary common sense, disproved all forms\r\nof naturalism that were founded on the denial of the reality of thought,\r\nand cut away the ground from a merely sensational and subjective\r\nidealism. This is what Aristotle means by claiming for Socrates that he\r\nwas the founder of definition. (2) He taught that life was explicable\r\nonly as a system of ends. Goodness consists in the knowledge of what\r\nthese are. It is by his hold upon them that the individual is able to\r\ngive unity and reality to his will. In expounding these ideas Socrates\r\nlimited himself to the sphere of practice. Moreover, the end or ideal of\r\nthe practical life was conceived of in too vague a way to be of much\r\npractical use. His principle, however, was essentially sound, and led\r\ndirectly to the Platonic Idealism. Plato extended the Socratic\r\ndiscovery to the whole of reality and while seeking to see the\r\npre-Socratics with the eyes of Socrates sought \"to see Socrates with the\r\neyes of the pre-Socratics.\" Not only were the virtues to be explained by\r\ntheir relation to a common or universal good which only intelligence\r\ncould apprehend, but there was nothing in all the furniture of heaven or\r\nearth which in like manner did not receive reality from the share it had\r\nin such an intelligible idea or essence. But these ideas are themselves\r\nintelligible only in relation to one another and to the whole.\r\nAccordingly Plato conceived of them as forming a system and finding\r\ntheir reality in the degree in which they embody the one all-embracing\r\nidea and conceived of not under the form of an efficient but of a final\r\ncause, an inner principle of action or tendency in things to realize the\r\nfullness of their own nature which in the last resort was identical with\r\nthe nature of the whole. This Plato expressed in the myth of the Sun,\r\nbut the garment of mythology in which Plato clothed his idealism,\r\nbeautiful as it is in itself and full of suggestion, covered an\r\nessential weakness. The more Plato dwelt upon his world of ideas, the\r\nmore they seemed to recede from the world of reality, standing over\r\nagainst it as principles of condemnation instead of revealing themselves\r\nin it. In this way the Good was made to appear as an end imposed upon\r\nthings from without by a creative intelligence instead of as an inner\r\nprinciple of adaptation.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Aristotle.\r\n\r\nOn one side of his thought Aristotle represents a reaction against\r\nidealism and a return to the position of common-sense dualism, but on\r\nanother, and this the deeper side, he represents the attempt to restore\r\nthe theory in a more satisfactory form. His account of the process of\r\nknowledge in his logical treatises exhibits the idealistic bent in its\r\nclearest form. This is as far removed as possible either from dualism or\r\nfrom empiricism. The universal is the real; it is that which gives\r\ncoherence and individuality to the particulars of sense which apart from\r\nit are like the routed or disbanded units of an army. Still more\r\nmanifestly in his _Ethics_ and _Politics Aristotle_ makes it clear that\r\nit is the common or universal will that gives substance and reality to\r\nthe individual. In spite of these and other anticipations of a fuller\r\nidealism, the idea remains as a form imposed from without on a reality\r\notherwise conceived of as independent of it. As we advance from the\r\nlogic to the metaphysics and from that to his ontology, it becomes clear\r\nthat the concepts are only \"categories\" or predicates of a reality lying\r\noutside of them, and there is an ultimate division between the world as\r\nthe object or matter of thought and the thinking or moving principle\r\nwhich gives its life. It is this that gives the Aristotelian doctrine in\r\nits more abstract statements an air of uncertainty. Yet besides the\r\nparticular contribution that Aristotle made to idealistic philosophy in\r\nhis logical and ethical interpretations, he advanced the case in two\r\ndirections, (a) He made it clear that no explanation of the world could\r\nbe satisfactory that was not based on the notion of continuity in the\r\nsense of an order of existence in which the reality of the lower was to\r\nbe sought for in the extent to which it gave expression to the\r\npotentialities of its own nature--which were also the potentialities of\r\nthe whole of which it was a part. (b) From this it followed that\r\ndifficult as we might find it to explain the relation of terms so remote\r\nfrom each other as sense and thought, the particular and the universal,\r\nmatter and mind, these oppositions cannot in their nature be absolute.\r\nThese truths, however, were hidden from Aristotle's successors, who for\r\nthe most part lost the thread which Socrates had put into their hand.\r\nWhen the authority of Aristotle was again invoked, it was its dualistic\r\nand formal, not its idealistic and metaphysical, side that was in\r\nharmony with the spirit of the age. Apart from one or two of the\r\ngreatest minds, notably Dante, what appealed to the thinkers of the\r\nmiddle ages was not the idea of reality as a progressive self-revelation\r\nof an inner principle working through nature and human life, but the\r\nformal principles of classification which it seemed to offer for a\r\nmaterial of thought and action given from another source.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Modern Idealism.\r\n\r\nModern like ancient idealism came into being as a correction of the\r\nview that threatened to resolve the world of matter and mind alike into\r\nthe changing manifestations of some single non-spiritual force or\r\nsubstance. While, however, ancient philosophy may be said to have been\r\nunilinear, modern philosophy had a twofold origin, and till the time of\r\nKant may be said to have pursued two independent courses.\r\n\r\nAll philosophy is the search for reality and rational certainty as\r\nopposed to mere formalism on the one hand, to authority and dogmatism on\r\nthe other. In this sense modern philosophy had a common root in revolt\r\nagainst medievalism. In England this revolt sought for the certainty and\r\nclearness that reason requires In the assurance of an outer world given\r\nto immediate sense experience; on the continent of Europe, in the\r\nassurance of an inner world given immediately in thought. Though\r\nstarting from apparently opposite poles and following widely different\r\ncourses the two movements led more or less directly to the same results.\r\nIt is easy to understand how English empiricism issued at once in the\r\ntrenchant naturalism of Hobbes. It is less comprehensible how the\r\nCartesian philosophy from the starting-point of thought allied itself\r\nwith a similar point of view. This can be understood only by a study of\r\nthe details of Descartes' philosophy (see CARTESIANISM). Suffice it to\r\nsay that in spite of its spiritualistic starting-point its general\r\nresult was to give a stimulus to the prevailing scientific tendency as\r\nrepresented by Galileo, Kepler and Harvey to the principle of mechanical\r\nexplanations of the phenomena of the universe. True it was precisely\r\nagainst this that Descartes' immediate successors struggled. But the\r\ntime-spirit was too strong for them. Determinism had other forms besides\r\nthat of a crude materialism, and the direction that Malebranche\r\nsucceeded in giving to speculation led only to the more complete denial\r\nof freedom and individuality in the all-devouring pantheism of Spinoza.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Berkeley.\r\n\r\nThe foundations of idealism in the modern sense were laid by the\r\nthinkers who sought breathing room for mind and will in a deeper\r\nanalysis of the relations of the subject to the world that it knows.\r\nFrom the outset English philosophy had a leaning to the psychological\r\npoint of view, and Locke was only carrying on the tradition of his\r\npredecessors and particularly of Hobbes in definitely accepting it as\r\nthe basis of his _Essay_. It was, however, Berkeley who first sought to\r\nutilize the conclusions that were implicit in Locke's starting-point to\r\ndisprove \"the systems of impious and profane persons which exclude all\r\nfreedom, intelligence, and design from the formation of things, and\r\ninstead thereof make a self-existent, stupid, unthinking substance the\r\nroot and origin of all beings.\" Berkeley's statement of the view that\r\nall knowledge is relative to the subject--that no object can be known\r\nexcept under the form which our powers of sense-perception, our memory\r\nand imagination, our notions and inference, give it--is still the most\r\nstriking and convincing that we possess. To have established this\r\nposition was a great step in speculation. Henceforth ordinary dogmatic\r\ndualism was excluded from philosophy; any attempt to revive it, whether\r\nwith Dr Johnson by an appeal to common prejudice, or, in the more\r\nreflective Johnsonianism of the 18th-century Scottish philosophers, must\r\nbe an anachronism. Equally impossible was it thenceforth to assert the\r\nmediate or immediate certainty of material substance as the cause either\r\nof events in nature or of sensations in ourselves. But with these\r\nadvances came the danger of falling into error from which common-sense\r\ndualism and naturalistic monism were free. From the point of view which\r\nBerkeley had inherited from Locke it seemed to follow that not only\r\nmaterial substance, but the whole conception of a world of objects, is\r\nat most an inference from subjective modifications which are the only\r\nimmediately certain objects of knowledge. The implications of such a\r\nview were first clearly apparent when Hume showed that on the basis of\r\nit there seemed to be nothing that we could confidently affirm except\r\nthe order of our own impressions and ideas. This being so, not only were\r\nphysics and mathematics impossible as sciences of necessary objective\r\ntruth, but our apparent consciousness of a permanent self and object\r\nalike must be delusive.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Kant.\r\n\r\nIt was these paradoxes that Kant sought to rebut by a more thoroughgoing\r\ncriticism of the basis of knowledge the substance of which is summed up\r\nin his celebrated Refutation of Idealism,[1] wherein he sought to\r\nundermine Hume's scepticism by carrying it one step further and\r\ndemonstrating that not only is all knowledge of self or object excluded,\r\nbut the consciousness of any series of impressions and ideas is itself\r\nimpossible except in relation to some external permanent and universally\r\naccepted world of objects.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Leibnitz.\r\n\r\nBut Kant's refutation of subjective idealism and his vindication of the\r\nplace of the object can be fully understood only when we take into\r\naccount the other defect in the teaching of his predecessors that he\r\nsought in his _Critique_ to correct. In continental philosophy the\r\nreaction against mechanical and pantheistic explanations of the universe\r\nfound even more definite utterance than in English psychological\r\nempiricism in the metaphysical system of Leibnitz, whose theory of\r\nself-determined monads can be understood only when taken in the light of\r\nthe assertion of the rights of the subject against the substance of\r\nSpinoza and the atoms of the materialist. But Leibnitz also anticipated\r\nKant in seeking to correct the empirical point of view of the English\r\nphilosophers. True, sense-given material is necessary in order that we\r\nmay have thought. \"But by what means,\" he asks, \"can experience and the\r\nsenses give ideas? Has the soul windows? Is it like a writing tablet? Is\r\nit like wax? It is plain that all those who think thus of the soul make\r\nit at bottom corporeal. True, nothing is in the intellect which has not\r\nbeen in the senses, but we must add except the intellect itself. The\r\nsoul contains the notions of being, substance, unity, identity, cause,\r\nperception, reasoning and many others which the senses cannot give\"\r\n(_Nouveaux essais_, ii. 1). But Leibnitz's conception of the priority of\r\nspirit had too little foundation, and the different elements he sought\r\nto combine were too loosely related to one another to stand the strain\r\nof the two forces of empiricism and materialism that were opposed to his\r\nidealism. More particularly by the confusion in which he left the\r\nrelation between the two logical principles of identity and of\r\nsufficient reason underlying respectively analytic and synthetic,\r\ndeductive and inductive thought, he may be said to have undermined in\r\nanother way the idealism he strove to establish. It was in seeking to\r\nclose up the fissure in his system represented by this dualism that his\r\nsuccessors succeeded only in adding weakness to weakness by reducing the\r\nprinciple of sufficient reason to that of formal identity (see WOLFF)\r\nand representing all thought as in essence analytic. From this it\r\nimmediately followed that, so far as the connexion of our experiences of\r\nthe external world does not show itself irreducible to that of formal\r\nidentity, it must remain unintelligible. As empiricism had foundered on\r\nthe difficulty of showing how our thoughts could be an object of sense\r\nexperience, so Leibnitzian formalism foundered on that of understanding\r\nhow the material of sense could be an object of thought. On one view as\r\non the other scientific demonstration was impossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Kant.\r\n\r\nThe extremity to which philosophy had been brought by empiricism on the\r\none hand and formalism on the other was Kant's opportunity. Leibnitz's\r\nprinciple of the \"nisi intellectus ipse\" was expanded by him into a\r\ndemonstration the completest yet effected by philosophy of the part\r\nplayed by the subject not merely in the manipulation of the material of\r\nexperience but in the actual constitution of the object that is known.\r\nOn the other hand he insisted on the synthetic character of this\r\nactivity without which it was impossible to get beyond the circle of our\r\nown thoughts. The parts of the _Critique of Pure Reason_, more\r\nparticularly the \"Deduction of the Categories\" in which this theory is\r\nworked out, may be said to have laid the foundation of modern\r\nidealism--\"articulum stantis aut cadentis doctrinae.\" In spite of the\r\ndefects of Kant's statement--to which it is necessary to return--the\r\nplace of the concepts and ideals of the mind and the synthetic\r\norganizing activity which these involve was established with a\r\ntrenchancy which has been acknowledged by all schools alike. The\r\n\"Copernican revolution\" which he claimed to have effected may be said to\r\nhave become the starting-point of all modern philosophy. Yet the\r\ndivergent uses that have been made of it witness to the ambiguity of his\r\nstatement which is traceable to the fact that Kant was himself too\r\ndeeply rooted in the thought of his predecessors and carried with him\r\ntoo much of their spirit to be able entirely to free himself from their\r\nassumptions and abstractions. His philosophy was more like\r\nMichaelangelo's famous sculpture of the Dawn, a spirit yet encumbered\r\nwith the stubble of the material from which it was hewn, than a clear\r\ncut figure with unmistakable outlines. Chief among these encumbering\r\npresuppositions was that of a fundamental distinction between perception\r\nand conception and consequent upon it between the synthetic and the\r\nanalytic use of thought. It is upon this in the last resort that the\r\ndistinction between the phenomenal world of our experience and a\r\nnoumenal world beyond it is founded. Kant perceives that \"perception\r\nwithout conception is blind, conception without perception is empty,\"\r\nbut if he goes so far ought he not to have gone still further and\r\ninquired whether there can be any perception at all without a concept,\r\nany concept which does not presuppose a precept, and, if this is\r\nimpossible, whether the distinction between a world of appearance which\r\nis known and a world of things-in-themselves which is not, is not\r\nillusory?\r\n\r\n\r\n  Hegel.\r\n\r\nIt was by asking precisely these questions that Hegel gave the finishing\r\nstrokes to the Kantian philosophy. The starting-point of all valid\r\nphilosophy must be the perception that the essence of all conscious\r\napprehension is the union of opposites--of which that of subject and\r\nobject is the most fundamental and all-pervasive. True, before\r\ndifferences can be united they must have been separated, but this merely\r\nproves that differentiation or analysis is only one factor in a single\r\nprocess. Equally fundamental is the element of synthesis. Nor is it\r\npossible at any point in knowledge to prove the existence of a merely\r\ngiven in whose construction the thinking subject has played no part nor\r\na merely thinking subject in whose structure the object is not an\r\norganic factor. In coming, as at a certain point in its development it\r\ndoes, to the consciousness of an object, the mind does not find itself\r\nin the presence of an opponent, or of anything essentially alien to\r\nitself but of that which gives content and stability to its own\r\nexistence. True, the stability it seems to find in it is incomplete. The\r\nobject cannot rest in the form of its immediate appearance without\r\ninvolving us in contradiction. The sun does not \"rise,\" the dew does not\r\n\"fall.\" But this only means that the unity between subject and object to\r\nwhich the gift of consciousness commits us is incompletely realized in\r\nthat appearance: the apparent truth has to submit to correction and\r\nsupplementation before it can be accepted as real truth. It does not\r\nmean that there is anywhere a mere fact which is not also an\r\ninterpretation nor an interpreting mind whose ideas have no hold upon\r\nfact. From this it follows that ultimate or absolute reality is to be\r\nsought not beyond the region of experience, but in the fullest and most\r\nharmonious statement of the facts of our experience. True a completely\r\nharmonious world whether of theory or of practice remains an ideal. But\r\nthe fact that we have already in part realized the ideal and that the\r\ndegree in which we have realized it is the degree in which we may regard\r\nour experience as trustworthy, is proof that the ideal is no mere idea\r\nas Kant taught, but the very substance of reality.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Stumbling blocks in Hegel's statements.\r\n\r\nIntelligible as this development of Kantian idealism seems in the light\r\nof subsequent philosophy, the first statement of it in Hegel was not\r\nfree from obscurity. The unity of opposites translated into its most\r\nabstract terms as the \"identity of being and not-being,\" the principle\r\nthat the \"real is the rational,\" the apparent substitution of\r\n\"bloodless\" categories for the substance of concrete reality gave it an\r\nair of paradox in the eyes of metaphysicians while physicists were\r\nscandalized by the premature attempts at a complete philosophy of nature\r\nand history. For this Hegel was doubtless partly to blame. But\r\nphilosophical critics of his own and a later day are not hereby absolved\r\nfrom a certain perversity in interpreting these doctrines in a sense\r\nprecisely opposite to that in which they were intended. The doctrine of\r\nthe unity of contraries so far from being the denial of the law of\r\nnon-contradiction is founded on an absolute reliance upon it. Freed from\r\nparadox it means that in every object of thought there are different\r\naspects or elements each of which if brought separately into\r\nconsciousness may be so emphasized as to appear to contradict another.\r\nUnity may be made to contradict diversity, permanence change, the\r\nparticular the universal, individuality relatedness. Ordinary\r\nconsciousness ignores these \"latent fires\"; ordinary discussion brings\r\nthem to light and divides men into factions and parties over them;\r\nphilosophy not because it denies but because it acknowledges the law of\r\nnon-contradiction as supreme is pledged to seek a point of view from\r\nwhich they may be seen to be in essential harmony with one another as\r\ndifferent sides of the same truth. The \"rationality of the real\" has in\r\nlike manner been interpreted as intended to sanctify the existing order.\r\nHegel undoubtedly meant to affirm that the actual was rational in the\r\nface of the philosophy which set up subjective feeling and reason\r\nagainst it. But idealism has insisted from the time of Plato on the\r\ndistinction between what is actual in time and space and the reality\r\nthat can only partially be revealed in it. Hegel carried this principle\r\nfurther than had yet been done. His phrase does not therefore sanctify\r\nthe established fact but, on the contrary, declares that it partakes of\r\nreality only so far as it embodies the ideal of a coherent and stable\r\nsystem which it is not. As little is idealism responsible for any\r\nattempt to pass off logical abstractions for concrete reality. The\r\n\"Logic\" of Hegel is merely the continuation of Kant's \"Deduction\" of the\r\ncategories and ideas of the reason which has generally been recognized\r\nas the soberest of attempts to set forth the presuppositions which\r\nunderlie all experience. \"What Hegel attempts to show is just that the\r\ncategories by which thought must determine its object are stages in a\r\nprocess that, beginning with the idea of 'Being,' the simplest of all\r\ndeterminations is driven on by its own dialectic till it reaches the\r\nidea of self-consciousness. In other words the intelligence when it once\r\nbegins to define an object for itself, finds itself launched on a\r\nmovement of self-asserting synthesis in which it cannot stop until it\r\nhad recognized that the unity of the object with itself involves its\r\nunity with all other objects and with the mind that knows it. Hence,\r\nwhatever we begin by saying, we must ultimately say 'mind'\" (Caird,\r\n_Kant_, i. 443).\r\n\r\n  While the form in which these doctrines were stated proved fatal to\r\n  them in the country of their birth, they took deep root in the next\r\n  generation in English philosophy. Here the stone that the builders\r\n  rejected was made the head of the corner. The influences which led to\r\n  this result were manifold. From the side of literature the way was\r\n  prepared for it by the genius of Coleridge, Wordsworth and Carlyle;\r\n  from the side of morals and politics by the profound discontent of the\r\n  constructive spirit of the century with the disintegrating conceptions\r\n  inherited from utilitarianism. In taking root in England idealism had\r\n  to contend against the traditional empiricism represented by Mill on\r\n  the one hand and the pseudo-Kantianism which was rendered current by\r\n  Mansel and Hamilton on the other. As contrasted with the first it\r\n  stood for the necessity of recognizing a universal or ideal element as\r\n  a constitutive factor in all experience whether cognitive or\r\n  volitional; as contrasted with the latter for the ultimate unity of\r\n  subject and object, knowledge and reality, and therefore for the\r\n  denial of the existence of any thing-in-itself for ever outside the\r\n  range of experience. Its polemic against the philosophy of experience\r\n  has exposed it to general misunderstanding, as though it claimed some\r\n  a priori path to truth. In reality it stands for a more thoroughgoing\r\n  and consistent application of the test of experience. The defect of\r\n  English empiricism from the outset had been the uncritical acceptance\r\n  of the metaphysical dogma of a pure unadulterated sense-experience as\r\n  the criterion of truth. This assumption idealism examines and rejects\r\n  in the name of experience itself. Similarly it only carried the\r\n  doctrine of relativity to its logical conclusion in denying that there\r\n  could be any absolute relativity. Object stands in essential relation\r\n  to subject, subject to object. This being so, it is wholly illogical\r\n  to seek for any test of the truth and reality of either except in the\r\n  form which that relation itself takes. In its subsequent development\r\n  idealism in England has passed through several clearly marked stages\r\n  which may be distinguished as (a) that of exploration and tentative\r\n  exposition in the writings of J. F. Ferrier,[2] J. Hutchison\r\n  Stirling,[3] Benjamin Jowett,[4] W. T. Harris;[5] (b) of confident\r\n  application to the central problems of logic, ethics and politics,\r\n  fine art and religion, and as a principle of constructive criticism\r\n  and interpretation chiefly in T. H. Green,[6] E. Caird,[7] B.\r\n  Bosanquet;[8] (c) of vigorous effort to develop on fresh lines its\r\n  underlying metaphysics in F. H. Bradley,[9] J. M. E. McTaggart,[10] A.\r\n  E. Taylor,[11] Josiah Royce[12] and others. Under the influence of\r\n  these writers idealism, as above expounded though with difference of\r\n  interpretation in individual writers, may be said towards the end of\r\n  the 19th century to have been on its way to becoming the leading\r\n  philosophy in the British Isles and America.\r\n\r\n\r\n  New Dualism and Pragmatism.\r\n\r\n3. _Reaction against Traditional Idealism._--But it was not to be\r\nexpected that the position idealism had thus won for itself would remain\r\nlong unchallenged. It had its roots in a literature and in forms of\r\nthought remote from the common track; it had been formulated before the\r\ngreat advances in psychology which marked the course of the century; its\r\nlatest word seemed to involve consequences that brought it into conflict\r\nwith the vital interest the human mind has in freedom and the\r\npossibility of real initiation. It is not, therefore, surprising that\r\nthere should have been a vigorous reaction. This has taken mainly two\r\nopposite forms. On the one hand the attack has come from the old ground\r\nof the danger that is threatened to the reality of the external world\r\nand may be said to be in the interest of the object. On the other hand\r\nthe theory has been attacked in the interest of the subject on the\r\nground that in the statuesque world of ideas into which it introduces us\r\nit leaves no room for the element of movement and process which recent\r\npsychology and metaphysic alike have taught us underlies all life. The\r\nconflict of idealism with these two lines of criticism--the accusation\r\nof subjectivism on the one side of intellectualism and rigid objectivism\r\non the other--may be said to have constituted the history of Anglo-Saxon\r\nphilosophy during the first decade of the 20th century.\r\n\r\nI. Whatever is to be said of ancient Idealism, the modern doctrine may\r\nbe said notably in Kant to have been in the main a vindication of the\r\nsubjective factor in knowledge. But that space and time, matter and\r\ncause should owe their origin to the action of the mind has always\r\nseemed paradoxical to common sense. Nor is the impression which its\r\nenunciation in Kant made, likely to have been lightened in this country\r\nby the connexion that was sure to be traced between Berkeleyanism and\r\nthe new teaching or by the form which the doctrine received at the hands\r\nof T. H. Green, its leading English representative between 1870 and\r\n1880. If what is real in things is ultimately nothing but their\r\nrelations, and if relations are inconceivable apart from the relating\r\nmind, what is this but the dissolution of the solid ground of external\r\nreality which my consciousness seems to assure me underlies and eludes\r\nall the conceptual network by which I try to bring one part of my\r\nexperience into connexion with another? It is quite true that modern\r\nidealists like Berkeley himself have sought to save themselves from the\r\ngulf of subjectivism by calling in the aid of a universal or infinite\r\nmind or by an appeal to a total or absolute experience to which our own\r\nis relative. But the former device is too obviously a _deus ex machina_,\r\nthe purpose of which would be equally well served by supposing with\r\nFichte the individual self to be endowed with the power of\r\nsubconsciously extraditing a world which returns to it in consciousness\r\nunder the form of a foreign creation. The appeal to an Absolute on the\r\nother hand is only to substitute one difficulty for another. For\r\ngranting that it places the centre of reality outside the individual\r\nself it does so only at the price of reducing the reality of the latter\r\nto an appearance; and if only one thing is real what becomes of the\r\nmany different things which again my consciousness assures me are the\r\none world with which I can have any practical concern? To meet these\r\ndifficulties and give back to us the assurance of the substantiality of\r\nthe world without us it has therefore been thought necessary to maintain\r\ntwo propositions which are taken to be the refutation of idealism. (1)\r\nThere is given to us immediately in knowledge a world entirely\r\nindependent of and different from our own impressions on the one hand\r\nand the conceptions by which we seek to establish relations between them\r\nupon the other. The relation of these impressions (and for the matter of\r\nthat of their inter-relations among themselves) to our minds is only one\r\nout of many. As a leading writer puts it: \"There is such a thing as\r\ngreenness having various relations, among others that of being\r\nperceived.\"[13] (2) Things may be, and may be known to be simply\r\ndifferent. They may exclude one another, exist so to speak in a\r\ncondition of armed neutrality to one another, without being positively\r\nthereby related to one another or altered by any change taking place in\r\nany of them. As the same writer puts it: \"There is such a thing as\r\nnumerical difference, different from conceptual difference,\"[14] or\r\nexpressing the same thing in other words \"there are relations not\r\ngrounded in the nature of the related terms.\"\r\n\r\nIn this double-barrelled criticism it is important to distinguish what\r\nis really relevant. Whatever the shortcomings of individual writers may\r\nbe, modern idealism differs, as we have seen, from the arrested idealism\r\nof Berkeley precisely in the point on which dualism insists. In all\r\nknowledge we are in touch not merely with the self and its passing\r\nstates, but with a real object which is different from them. On this\r\nhead there is no difference, and idealism need have no difficulty in\r\naccepting all that its opponents here contend. The difference between\r\nthe two theories does not consist in any difference of emphasis on the\r\nobjective side of knowledge, but in the standard by which the nature of\r\nthe object is to be tested--the difference is logical not\r\nmetaphysical--it concerns the definition of truth or falsity in the\r\nknowledge of the reality which both admit. To idealism there can be no\r\nultimate test, but the possibility of giving any fact which claims to be\r\ntrue its place in a coherent system of mutually related truths. To this\r\ndualism opposes the doctrine that truth and falsehood are a matter of\r\nmere immediate intuition: \"There is no problem at all in truth and\r\nfalsehood, some propositions are true and some false just as some roses\r\nare red and some white.\"[15] The issue between the two theories under\r\nthis head may here be left with the remark that it is a curious comment\r\non the logic of dualism that setting out to vindicate the reality of an\r\nobjective standard of truth it should end in the most subjective of all\r\nthe way a thing appears to the individual. The criticism that applies to\r\nthe first of the above contentions applies _mutatis mutandis_ to the\r\nsecond. As idealism differs from Berkeleyanism in asserting the reality\r\nof an \"external\" world so it differs from Spinozism in asserting the\r\nreality of difference within it. Determination is not merely negation.\r\nOn this head there need be no quarrel between it and dualism. Ours is a\r\nmany-sided, a many-coloured world. The point of conflict again lies in\r\nthe nature and ground of the assigned differences. Dualism meets the\r\nassertion of absolute unity by the counter assertion of mere difference.\r\nBut if it is an error to treat the unity of the world as its only real\r\naspect, it is equally an error to treat its differences as something\r\nultimately irreducible. No philosophy founded on this assumption is\r\nlikely to maintain itself against the twofold evidence of modern\r\npsychology and modern logic. According to the first the world, whether\r\nlooked at from the side of our perception or from the side of the object\r\nperceived, can be made intelligible only when we accept it for what it\r\nis as a real continuity. Differences, of course, there are; and, if we\r\nlike to say so, every difference is unique, but this does not mean that\r\nthey are given in absolute independence of everything else, \"fired at us\r\nout of a cannon.\" They bear a definite relation to the structure of our\r\nphysical and psychical nature, and correspond to definite needs of the\r\nsubject that manifests itself therein. Similarly from the side of logic.\r\nIt is not the teaching of idealism alone but of the facts which logical\r\nanalysis has brought home to us that all difference in the last resort\r\nfinds its ground in the quality or content of the things differentiated,\r\nand that this difference of content shows in turn a double strand, the\r\nstrand of sameness and the strand of otherness--that _in_ which and that\r\n_by_ which they differ from one another. Idealism has, of course, no\r\nquarrel with numerical difference. All difference has its numerical\r\naspect: two different things are always two both in knowledge and in\r\nreality. What it cannot accept is the doctrine that there are two things\r\nwhich are two in themselves apart from that which makes them two--which\r\nare not two _of something_. So far from establishing the truth for which\r\ndualism is itself concerned--the reality of all differences--such a\r\ntheory can end only in a scepticism as to the reality of any difference.\r\nIt is difficult to see what real difference there can be between things\r\nwhich are differences of nothing.\r\n\r\nII. More widespread and of more serious import is the attack from the\r\nother side to which since the publication of A. Seth's _Hegelianism and\r\nPersonality_ (1887) and W. James's _Will to Believe_ (1903) idealism has\r\nbeen subjected. Here also it is important to distinguish what is\r\nrelevant from what is irrelevant in the line of criticism represented by\r\nthese writers. There need be no contradiction between idealism and a\r\nreasonable pragmatism. In so far as the older doctrine is open to the\r\ncharge of neglecting the conative and teleological side of experience it\r\ncan afford to be grateful to its critics for recalling it to its own\r\neponymous principle of the priority of the \"ideal\" to the \"idea,\" of\r\n_needs_ to the conception of their object. The real issue comes into\r\nview in the attempt, undertaken in the interest of freedom, to\r\nsubstitute for the notion of the world as a cosmos pervaded by no\r\ndiscernible principle and in its essence indifferent to the form\r\nimpressed upon it by its active parts.\r\n\r\n  To the older idealism as to the new the essence of mind or spirit is\r\n  freedom. But the guarantee of freedom is to be sought for not in the\r\n  denial of law, but in the whole nature of mind and its relation to the\r\n  structure of experience. _Without mind no orderly world_: only through\r\n  the action of the subject and its \"ideas\" are the confused and\r\n  incoherent data of sense-perception (themselves shot through with both\r\n  strands) built up into that system of things we call Nature, and which\r\n  stands out against the subject as the body stands out against the soul\r\n  whose functioning may be said to have created it. On the other hand,\r\n  _without the world no mind_: only through the action of the\r\n  environment upon the subject is the idealizing activity in which it\r\n  finds its being called into existence. Herein lies the paradox which\r\n  is also the deepest truth of our spiritual life. In interpreting its\r\n  environment first as a world of things that seem to stand in a\r\n  relation of exclusion to one another and to itself, then as a natural\r\n  system governed by rigid mechanical necessity, the mind can yet feel\r\n  that in its very opposition the world is akin to it, bone of its bone\r\n  and flesh of its flesh. What is true of mind is true of will. Idealism\r\n  starts from the relativity of the world to purposive consciousness.\r\n  But this again may be so stated as to represent only one side of the\r\n  truth. It is equally true that the will is relative to the world of\r\n  objects and interests to which it is attached through instincts and\r\n  feelings, habits and sentiments. In isolation from its object the will\r\n  is as much an abstraction as thought apart from the world of percepts,\r\n  memories and associations which give it content and stability. And\r\n  just as mind does not lose but gain in individuality in proportion as\r\n  it parts with any claim to the capricious determination of what its\r\n  world shall be, and becomes dominated by the conception of an order\r\n  which is immutable so the will becomes free and \"personal\" in\r\n  proportion as it identifies itself with objects and interests, and\r\n  subordinates itself to laws and requirements which involve the\r\n  suppression of all that is merely arbitrary and subjective. Here, too,\r\n  subject and object grow together. The power and vitality of the one is\r\n  the power and vitality of the other, and this is so because they are\r\n  not two things with separate roots but are both rooted in a common\r\n  reality which, while it includes, is more than either.\r\n\r\n  Passing by these contentions as unmeaning or irrelevant and seeing\r\n  nothing but irreconcilable contradiction between the conceptions of\r\n  the world as immutable law and a self-determining subject pragmatism\r\n  (q.v.) seeks other means of vindicating the reality of freedom. It\r\n  agrees with older forms of libertarianism in taking its stand on the\r\n  fact of spontaneity as primary and self-evidencing, but it is not\r\n  content to assert its existence side by side with rigidly determined\r\n  sequence. It carries the war into the camp of the enemy by seeking to\r\n  demonstrate that the completely determined action which is set over\r\n  against freedom as the basis of explanation in the material world is\r\n  merely a hypothesis which, while it serves sufficiently well the\r\n  limited purpose for which it is devised, is incapable of verification\r\n  in the ultimate constituents of physical nature. There seems in fact\r\n  nothing to prevent us from holding that while natural laws express the\r\n  average tendencies of multitudes they give no clue to the movement of\r\n  individuals. Some have gone farther and argued that from the nature of\r\n  the case no causal explanation of any real change in the world of\r\n  things is possible. A cause is that which contains the effect (\"causa\r\n  aequat effectum\"), but this is precisely what can never be proved with\r\n  respect to anything that is claimed as a real cause in the concrete\r\n  world. Everywhere the effect reveals an element which is\r\n  indiscoverable in the cause with the result that the identity we seek\r\n  for ever eludes us. Even the resultant of mechanical forces refuses to\r\n  resolve itself into its constituents. In the \"resultant\" there is a\r\n  new direction, and with it a new quality the component forces of which\r\n  no analysis can discover.[16]\r\n\r\nIt is not here possible to do more than indicate what appear to be the\r\nvalid elements in these two conflicting interpretations of the\r\nrequirements of a true idealism. On behalf of the older it may be\r\nconfidently affirmed that no solution is likely to find general\r\nacceptance which involves the rejection of the conception of unity and\r\nintelligible order as the primary principle of our world. The assertion\r\nof this principle by Kant was, we have seen, the corner-stone of\r\nidealistic philosophy in general, underlying as it does the conception\r\nof a permanent subject not less than that of a permanent object. As\r\nlittle from the side of knowledge is it likely that any theory will find\r\nacceptance which reduces all thought to a process of analysis and the\r\ndiscovery of abstract identity. There is no logical principle which\r\nrequires that we should derive qualitative change by logical analysis\r\nfrom quantitative difference. Everywhere experience is synthetic: it\r\ngives us multiplicity in unity. Explanation of it does not require the\r\nannihilation of all differences but the apprehension of them in organic\r\nrelation to one another and to the whole to which they belong. It was,\r\nas we have seen, this conception of thought as essentially synthetic for\r\nwhich Kant paved the way in his polemic against the formalism of his\r\ncontinental predecessors. The revival as in the above argument of the\r\nidea that the function of thought is the elimination of difference, and\r\nthat rational connexion must fail where absolute identity is\r\nindiscoverable merely shows how imperfectly Kant's lesson has been\r\nlearned by some of those who prophesy in his name.\r\n\r\nFinally, apart from these more academic arguments there is an undoubted\r\nparadox in a theory which, at a moment when in whatever direction we\r\nlook the best inspiration in poetry, sociology and physical science\r\ncomes from the idea of the unity of the world, gives in its adhesion to\r\npluralism on the ground of its preponderating practical value.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, idealism would be false to itself if it interpreted\r\nthe unity which it thus seeks to establish in any sense that is\r\nincompatible with the validity of moral distinctions and human\r\nresponsibility in the fullest sense of the term. It would on its side\r\nbe, indeed, a paradox if at a time when the validity of human ideals and\r\nthe responsibility of nations and individuals to realize them is more\r\nuniversally recognized than ever before on our planet, the philosophical\r\ntheory which hitherto has been chiefly identified with their vindication\r\nshould be turned against them. Yet the depth and extent of the\r\ndissatisfaction are sufficient evidence that the most recent\r\ndevelopments are not free from ambiguity on this vital issue.\r\n\r\nWhat is thus suggested is not a rash departure from the general point of\r\nview of idealism (by its achievements in every field to which it has\r\nbeen applied, \"stat mole sua\") but a cautious inquiry into the\r\npossibility of reaching a conception of the world in which a place can\r\nbe found at once for the idea of unity and determination and of movement\r\nand freedom. Any attempt here to anticipate what the course of an\r\nidealism inspired by such a spirit of caution and comprehension is\r\nlikely to be cannot but appear dogmatic.\r\n\r\n  Yet it may be permitted to make a suggestion. Taking for granted the\r\n  unity of the world idealism is committed to interpret it as spiritual\r\n  as a unity of spirits. This is implied in the phrase by which it has\r\n  sought to signalize its break with Spinozism: \"from substance to\r\n  subject.\" The universal or infinite is one that realizes itself in\r\n  finite particular minds and wills, not as accidents or imperfections\r\n  of it, but as its essential form. These on their side, to be subject\r\n  in the true sense must be conceived of as possessing a life which is\r\n  truly their own, the expression of their own nature as\r\n  self-determinant. In saying subject we say self, in saying self we say\r\n  free creator. No conception of the infinite can therefore be true\r\n  which does not leave room for movement, process, free creation.\r\n  Oldness, sameness, permanence of principle and direction, these must\r\n  be, otherwise there is _nothing_; but newness of embodiment,\r\n  existence, realization also, otherwise nothing _is_.\r\n\r\n  Now it is just to these implications in the idea of spirit that some\r\n  of the prominent recent expositions of Idealism seem to have failed to\r\n  do justice. They have failed particularly when they have left the idea\r\n  of \"determination\" unpurged of the suggestion of time succession. The\r\n  very word lends itself to this mistake. Idealists have gone beyond\r\n  others in asserting that the subject in the sense of a being which\r\n  merely repeats what has gone before is timeless. This involves that\r\n  its activity cannot be truly conceived of as included in an\r\n  antecedent, as an effect in a cause or one term of an equation in the\r\n  other. As the activity of a subject or spirit it is essentially a new\r\n  birth. It is this failure that has led to the present revolt against a\r\n  \"block universe.\" But the difficulty is not to be met by running to\r\n  the, opposite extreme in the assertion of a loose and ramshackle one.\r\n  This is merely another way of perpetuating the mistake of allowing the\r\n  notion of determination by an _other_ or a preceding to continue to\r\n  dominate us in a region where we have in reality passed from it to the\r\n  notion of determination by self or by self-acknowledged ideals. As the\r\n  correction from the one side consists in a more whole-hearted\r\n  acceptance of the conception of determination by an ideal as the\r\n  essence of mind, so from the other side it must consist in the\r\n  recognition of the valuelessness of a freedom which does not mean\r\n  submission to a self-chosen, though not self-created, law.\r\n\r\n  The solution here suggested is probably more likely to meet with\r\n  opposition from the side of Idealism than of Pragmatism. It involves,\r\n  it will be said, the reality of time, the dependence of the Infinite\r\n  in the finite, and therewith a departure from the whole line of\r\n  Hegelian thought. (1) It does surely involve the reality of time in\r\n  the sense that it involves the reality of existence, which it is\r\n  agreed is process. Without process the eternal is not complete or, if\r\n  eternity means completeness, is not truly eternal. Our mistake lies in\r\n  abstraction of the one from the other, which, as always, ends in\r\n  confusion of the one with the other. Truth lies in giving each its\r\n  place. Not only does eternity assert the conception of the hour but\r\n  the hour asserts the conception of eternity--with what adequacy is\r\n  another question. (2) The second of the above objections takes its\r\n  point from the contradiction to religious consciousness which seems to\r\n  be involved. This is certainly a mistake. Religious consciousness\r\n  asserts, no doubt, that God is necessary to the soul: from Him as its\r\n  inspiration, to Him as its ideal are all things. But it asserts with\r\n  equal emphasis that the soul is necessary to God. To declare itself an\r\n  unnecessary creation is surely on the part of the individual soul the\r\n  height of impiety. God lives in the soul as it in Him. He also might\r\n  say, from it as His offspring, to it as the object of His outgoing\r\n  love are all things. (3) It is a mistake to attribute to Hegel the\r\n  doctrine that time is an illusion. If in a well-known passage (_Logic_\r\n  § 212) he seems to countenance the Spinoxistic view he immediately\r\n  corrects it by assigning an \"actualizing force\" to this illusion and\r\n  making it a \"necessary dynamic element of truth.\" Consistently with\r\n  this we have the conclusion stated in the succeeding section on the\r\n  Will. \"Good, the final end of the world, has being only while it\r\n  constantly produces itself. And the world of the spirit and the world\r\n  of nature continue to have this distinction, that the latter moves\r\n  only in a recurring cycle while the former certainly also makes\r\n  progress.\" The mistake is not Hegel's but ours. It is to be remedied\r\n  not by giving up the idea of the Infinite but by ceasing to think of\r\n  the Infinite as of a being endowed with a static perfection which the\r\n  finite will merely reproduces, and definitely recognizing the forward\r\n  effort of the finite as an essential element in Its self-expression.\r\n  If there be any truth in this suggestion it seems likely that the last\r\n  word of idealism, like the first, will prove to be that the type of\r\n  the highest reality is to be sought for not in any fixed Parmenidean\r\n  circle of achieved being but in an ideal of good which while never\r\n  fully expressed under the form of time can never become actual and so\r\n  fulfil itself under any other.\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY.--(A) General works besides those of the writers\r\n  mentioned above: W.

After\r\nholding various official posts under the Prussian government he became\r\nprofessor at the university of Berlin in 1821, and eighteen years later\r\nforeign member of the Institute of France. From 1816 to 1822 he was\r\ntutor to the young princes William Frederick and Charles. He died in\r\nBerlin on the 10th of August 1846. He devoted his life chiefly to the\r\nexamination of ancient systems of chronology. In 1825-1826 he published\r\nhis great work, _Handbuch der mathematischen und technischen\r\nChronologie_ (2 vols.; 2nd ed., 1883), re-edited as _Lehrbuch der\r\nChronologie_ (1831); a supplementary volume, _Die Zeitrechnung der\r\nChinesen_, appeared in 1839. Beside these important works he wrote also\r\n_Untersuchungen über d. Ursprung und d. Bedeutung d. Sternnamen_ (1809)\r\nand _Über d. Ursprung d. Thierkreises_ (1838). With Nolte he published\r\nhandbooks on English and French language and literature. His son, JULIUS\r\nLUDWIG IDELER (1809-1842), wrote _Meteorologia veterum Graecorum et\r\nRomanorum_ (1832).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIDENTIFICATION (Lat. _idem_, the same), the process of proving any one's\r\nidentity, i.e. that he is the man he purports to be, or--if he is\r\npretending to be some one else--the man he really is; or in case of\r\ndispute, that he is the man he is alleged to be. As more strenuous\r\nefforts have been made for the pursuit of criminals, and more and more\r\nsevere penalties are inflicted on old offenders, means of identification\r\nhave become essential, and various processes have been tried to secure\r\nthat desirable end. For a long time they continued to be most imperfect;\r\nnothing better was devised than rough and ready methods of recognition\r\ndepending upon the memories of officers of the law or the personal\r\nimpressions of witnesses concerned in the case, supplemented in more\r\nrecent years by photographs, not always a safe and unerring guide. The\r\nmachinery employed was cumbrous, wasteful of time and costly. Detective\r\npolicemen were marched in a body to inspect arrested prisoners in the\r\nexercising yards of the prison. Accused persons were placed in the midst\r\nof a number of others of approximately like figure and appearance, and\r\nthe prosecutor and witnesses were called in one by one to pick out the\r\noffender. Inquiries, with a detailed description of distinctive marks,\r\nand photographs were circulated far and wide to local police forces.\r\nOfficers, police and prison wardens were despatched in person to give\r\nevidence of identity at distant courts. Mis-identification was by no\r\nmeans rare. Many remarkable cases may be quoted. One of the most notable\r\nwas that of the Frenchman Lesurques, in the days of the Directory, who\r\nwas positively identified as having robbed the Lyons mail and suffered\r\ndeath, protesting his innocence of the crime, which was afterwards\r\nbrought home to another man, Duboscq, and this terrible judicial error\r\nproved to be the result of the extraordinary likeness between the two\r\nmen. Another curious case is to be found in American records, when a man\r\nwas indicted for bigamy as James Hoag, who averred that he was really\r\nThomas Parker. There was a marvellous conflict of testimony, even wives\r\nand families and personal friends being misled, and there was a narrow\r\nescape of mis-identification. The leading modern case in England is that\r\nof Adolf Beck (1905). Beck (who eventually died at the end of 1909) was\r\narrested on the complaint of a number of women who positively swore to\r\nhis identity as Smith, a man who had defrauded them. An ex-policeman who\r\nhad originally arrested Smith also swore that Beck was the same man.\r\nThere was a grave miscarriage of justice. Beck was sentenced to penal\r\nservitude, and although a closer examination of the personal marks\r\nshowed that Beck could not possibly be Smith, it was only after a\r\nscandalous delay, due to the obstinacy of responsible officials, that\r\nrelief was afforded. It has to be admitted that evidence as to identity\r\nbased on personal impressions is perhaps of all classes of evidence the\r\nleast to be relied upon.\r\n\r\nSuch elements of uncertainty cannot easily be eliminated from any system\r\nof jurisprudence, but some improvements in the methods of identification\r\nhave been introduced in recent years. The first was in the adoption of\r\nanthropometry (q.v.), which was invented by the French savant, A.\r\nBertillon. The reasons that led to its general supersession may be\r\nsummed up in its costliness, the demand for superior skill in\r\nsubordinate agents and the liability to errors not easy to trace and\r\ncorrect. A still more potent reason remained, the comparative failure of\r\nresults. It was found in the first four years of its use in England and\r\nWales that an almost inappreciable number of identifications were\r\neffected by the anthropometric system; namely, 152 in 1898, 243 in 1899,\r\n462 in 1900, and 503 in 1901, the year in which it was supplemented by\r\nthe use of \"finger prints\" (q.v.). The figures soon increased by leaps\r\nand bounds. In 1902 the total number of searches among the records were\r\n6826 and the identifications 1722 for London and the provinces; in 1903\r\nthe searches were 11,919, the identifications 3642; for the first half\r\nof 1904 the searches were 6697 and the identifications 2335. In India\r\nand some of the colonies the results were still more remarkable; the\r\nrecognitions in 1903 were 9512, and 17,289 in 1904. Were returns\r\navailable from other countries very similar figures would no doubt be\r\nshown. Among these countries are Ireland, Australasia, Ceylon, South\r\nAfrica, and many great cities of the United States; and the system is\r\nextending to Germany, Austria-Hungary and other parts of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe record of finger prints in England and Wales is kept by the\r\nMetropolitan police at New Scotland Yard. They were at first limited to\r\npersons convicted at courts at quarter sessions and assizes and to all\r\npersons sentenced at minor courts to more than a month without option of\r\nfine for serious offences. The finger prints when taken by prison\r\nwarders are forwarded to London for registration and reference on\r\ndemand. The total number of finger-print slips was 70,000 in 1904, and\r\nweekly additions were being made at the rate of 350 slips. The\r\nadvantages of the record system need not be emphasized. By its means\r\nidentification is prompt, inevitable and absolutely accurate. By\r\nforwarding the finger prints of all remanded prisoners to New Scotland\r\nYard, their antecedents are established beyond all hesitation.\r\n\r\nIn past times identification of criminals who had passed through the\r\nhands of the law was compassed by branding, imprinting by a hot iron, or\r\ntattooing with an indelible sign, such as a crown, fleur de lys or\r\ninitials upon the shoulder or other part of the body. This practice,\r\nlong since abandoned, was in a measure continued in the British army,\r\nwhen offenders against military law were ordered by sentence of\r\ncourt-martial to be marked with \"D\" for deserter and \"B.C.\" bad\r\ncharacter; this ensured their recognition and prevented re-enlistment;\r\nbut all such penalties have now disappeared.     (A. G.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIDEOGRAPH (Gr. [Greek: idea], idea, and [Greek: graphein], to write), a\r\nsymbol or character painted, written or inscribed, representing ideas\r\nand not sounds; such a form of writing is found in Chinese and in most\r\nof the Egyptian hieroglyphs (see WRITING).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIDIOBLAST (Gr. [Greek: idios], peculiar, and [Greek: blastos], a shoot),\r\na botanical term for an individual cell which is distinguished by its\r\nshape, size or contents, such as the stone-cells in the soft tissue of a\r\npear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIDIOM (Gr. [Greek: idiôma], something peculiar and personal; [Greek:\r\nidios], one's own, personal), a form of expression whether in words,\r\ngrammatical construction, phraseology, &c., which is peculiar to a\r\nlanguage; sometimes also a special variety of a particular language, a\r\ndialect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIDIOSYNCRASY (Gr. [Greek: idiosynkrasia], peculiar habit of body or\r\ntemperament; [Greek: idios], one's own, and [Greek: synkrasis],\r\nblending, tempering, from [Greek: sygkerannusthai], to put together,\r\ncompound, mix), a physical or mental condition peculiar to an individual\r\nusually taking the form of a special susceptibility to particular\r\nstimuli; thus it is an idiosyncrasy of one individual that abnormal\r\nsensations of discomfort should be excited by certain odours or colours,\r\nby the presence in the room of a cat, &c.; similarly certain persons are\r\nfound to be peculiarly responsive or irresponsive to the action of\r\nparticular drugs. The word is also used, generally, of any eccentricity\r\nor peculiarity of character, appearance, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIDOLATRY, the worship (Gr. [Greek: latreia]) of idols (Gr. [Greek:\r\neidôlon]), i.e. images or other objects, believed to represent or be the\r\nabode of a superhuman personality. The term is often used generically to\r\ninclude such varied, forms as litholatry, dendrolatry, pyrolatry,\r\nzoolatry and even necrolatry. In an age when the study of religion was\r\npractically confined to Judaism and Christianity, idolatry was regarded\r\nas a degeneration from an uncorrupt primeval faith, but the comparative\r\nand historical investigation of religion has shown it to be rather a\r\nstage of an upward movement, and that by no means the earliest. It is\r\nnot found, for instance, among Bushmen, Fuegians, Eskimos, while it\r\nreached a high development among the great civilizations of the ancient\r\nworld in both hemispheres.[1] Its earliest stages are to be sought in\r\nnaturism and animism. To give concreteness to the vague ideas thus\r\nworshipped the idol, at first rough and crude, comes to the help of the\r\nsavage, and in course of time through inability to distinguish\r\nsubjective and objective, comes to be identified with the idea it\r\noriginally symbolized. The degraded form of animism known as fetichism\r\nis usually the direct antecedent of idolatry. A fetich is adored, not\r\nfor itself, but for the spirit who dwells in it and works through it.\r\nFetiches of stone or wood were at a very early age shaped and polished\r\nor coloured and ornamented. A new step was taken when the top of the log\r\nor stone was shaped like a human head; the rest of the body soon\r\nfollowed. The process can be followed with some distinctness in Greece.\r\nSometimes, as in Babylonia and India, the representation combined human\r\nand animal forms, but the human figure is the predominant model; man\r\nmakes God after his own image.\r\n\r\nIdols may be private and personal like the teraphim of the Hebrews or\r\nthe little figures found in early Egyptian tombs, or--a late\r\ndevelopment, public and tribal or national. Some, like the ancestral\r\nimages among the Maoris, are the intermittent abodes of the spirits of\r\nthe dead.\r\n\r\nAs the earlier stages in the development of the religious consciousness\r\npersist and are often manifest in idolatry, so in the higher stages,\r\nwhen men have attained loftier spiritual ideas, idolatry itself survives\r\nand is abundantly visible as a reactionary tendency. The history of the\r\nJewish people whom the prophets sought, for long in vain, to wean from\r\nworshipping images is an illustration: so too the vulgarities of modern\r\npopular Hinduism contrasted with the lofty teaching of the Indian sacred\r\nbooks.\r\n\r\nIn the New Testament the word [Greek: eidôlolatreia] (_idololatria_,\r\nafterwards shortened occasionally to [Greek: eidolatreia], _idolatria_)\r\noccurs in all four times, viz. in 1 Cor. x. 14; Gal. v. 20; 1 Peter iv.\r\n3; Col. iii. 5. In the last of these passages it is used to describe the\r\nsin of covetousness or \"mammon-worship.\" In the other places it\r\nindicates with the utmost generality all the rites and practices of\r\nthose special forms of paganism with which Christianity first came into\r\ncollision. It can only be understood by reference to the LXX., where\r\n[Greek: eidôlon] (like the word \"idol\" in A.V.) occasionally translates\r\nindifferently no fewer than sixteen words by which in the Old Testament\r\nthe objects of what the later Jews called \"strange worship\" (Hebrew:\r\navoda zara) are denoted (see _Encyclopaedia Biblica_). In the widest\r\nacceptation of the word, idolatry in any form is absolutely forbidden in\r\nthe second commandment, which runs \"Thou shalt not make unto thee a\r\ngraven image; [and] to no visible shape in heaven above, or in the earth\r\nbeneath, or in the water under the earth, shalt thou bow down or render\r\nservice\" (see DECALOGUE). For some account of the questions connected\r\nwith the breaches of this law which are recorded in the history of the\r\nIsraelites see the article JEWS; those differences as to the\r\ninterpretation of the prohibition which have so seriously divided\r\nChristendom are discussed under the head of ICONOCLASTS.\r\n\r\nIn the ancient church, idolatry was naturally reckoned among those\r\n_magna crimina_ or great crimes against the first and second\r\ncommandments which involved the highest ecclesiastical censures. Not\r\nonly were those who had gone openly to heathen temples and partaken in\r\nthe sacrifices (_sacrificati_) or burnt incense (_thurificati_) held\r\nguilty of this crime; the same charge, in various degrees, was incurred\r\nby those whose renunciation of idolatry had been private merely, or who\r\notherwise had used unworthy means to evade persecution, by those also\r\nwho had feigned themselves mad to avoid sacrificing, by all promoters\r\nand encouragers of idolatrous rites, and by idol makers, incense sellers\r\nand architects or builders of structures connected with idol worship.\r\nIdolatry was made a crime against the state by the laws of Constantius\r\n(_Cod. Theod._ xvi. 10. 4, 6), forbidding all sacrifices on pain of\r\ndeath, and still more by the statutes of Theodosius (_Cod. Theod._ xvi.\r\n10. 12) enacted in 392, in which sacrifice and divination were declared\r\ntreasonable and punishable with death; the use of lights, incense,\r\ngarlands and libations was to involve the forfeiture of house and land\r\nwhere they were used; and all who entered heathen temples were to be\r\nfined. See Bingham, _Antiqq._ bk. xvi. c. 4.\r\n\r\n  See also IMAGE-WORSHIP; and on the whole question, RELIGION.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n  [1] According to Varro the Romans had no animal or human image of a\r\n    god for 170 years after the founding of the city; Herodotus (i. 131)\r\n    says the Persians had no temples or idols before Artaxerxes I.;\r\n    Lucian (_De sacrif._ 11) bears similar testimony for Greece and as to\r\n    idols (_Dea Syr._ 3) for Egypt. Eusebius (_Praep. Evang._ i. 9) sums\r\n    up the theory of antiquity in his statement \"the oldest peoples had\r\n    no idols.\" Images of the gods indeed presuppose a definiteness of\r\n    conception and powers of discrimination that could only be the result\r\n    of history and reflection. The iconic age everywhere succeeded to an\r\n    era in which the objects of worship were aniconic, e.g. wooden posts,\r\n    stone steles, cones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIDOMENEUS, in Greek legend, son of Deucalion, grandson of Minos and\r\nPasiphaë, and king of Crete. As a descendant of Zeus and famous for his\r\nbeauty, he was one of the suitors of Helen; hence, after her abduction\r\nby Paris, he took part in the Trojan War, in which he distinguished\r\nhimself by his bravery. He is mentioned as a special favourite of\r\nAgamemnon (_Iliad_, iv. 257). According to Homer (_Odyssey_, iii. 191),\r\nhe returned home safely with all his countrymen who had survived the\r\nwar, but later legend connects him with an incident similar to that of\r\nJephtha's daughter. Having been overtaken by a violent storm, to ensure\r\nhis safety he vowed to sacrifice to Poseidon the first living thing that\r\nmet him when he landed on his native shore. This proved to be his son,\r\nwhom he slew in accordance with his vow; whereupon a plague broke out in\r\nthe island, and Idomeneus was driven out. He fled to the district of\r\nSallentum in Calabria, and subsequently to Colophon in Asia Minor, where\r\nhe settled near the temple of the Clarian Apollo and was buried on Mount\r\nCercaphus (Virgil, _Aeneid_, iii. 121, 400, 531, and Servius on those\r\npassages). But the Cretans showed his grave at Cnossus, where he was\r\nworshipped as a hero with Meriones (Diod. Sic. v. 79).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIDRIA, a mining town in Carniola, Austria, 25 m. W. of Laibach. Pop.\r\n(1900) 5772. It is situated in a narrow Alpine valley, on the river\r\nIdria, an affluent of the Isonzo, and owes its prosperity to the rich\r\nmines of quicksilver which were accidentally discovered in 1497. Since\r\n1580 they have been under the management of the government. The\r\nmercurial ore lies in a bed of clay slate, and is found both mingled\r\nwith schist and in the form of cinnabar. A special excellence of the ore\r\nis the greatness of the yield of pure metal compared with the amount of\r\nthe refuse. As regards the quantity annually extracted, the mines of\r\nIdria rank second to those of Almaden in Spain, which are the richest in\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIDRIALIN, a mineral wax accompanying the mercury ore in Idria. According\r\nto Goldschmidt it can be extracted by means of xylol, amyl alcohol or\r\nturpentine; also without decomposition, by distillation in a current of\r\nhydrogen, or carbon dioxide. It is a white crystalline body, very\r\ndifficultly fusible, boiling above 440° C. (824° F.), of the composition\r\nC40H28O. Its solution in glacial acetic acid, by oxidation with chromic\r\nacid, yielded a red powdery solid and a fatty acid fusing at 62° C., and\r\nexhibiting all the characters of a mixture of palmitic and stearic\r\nacids.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIDRISI, or EDRISI [Abu Abdallah Mahommed Ibn Mahommed Ibn Abdallah Ibn\r\nIdrisi, c. A.D. 1099-1154], Arabic geographer. Very little is known of\r\nhis life. Having left Islamic lands and become the courtier and\r\npanegyrist of a Christian prince, though himself a descendant of the\r\nProphet, he was probably regarded by strict Moslems as a scandal, whose\r\nname should not, if possible, be mentioned. His great-grandfather,\r\nIdrisi II., \"Biamrillah,\" a member of the great princely house which had\r\nreigned for a time as caliphs in north-west Africa, was prince of\r\nMalaga, and likewise laid claim to the supreme title (Commander of the\r\nFaithful). After his death in 1055, Malaga was seized by Granada (1057),\r\nand the Idrisi family then probably migrated to Ceuta, where a freedman\r\nof theirs held power. Here the geographer appears to have been born in\r\nA.H. 493 (A.D. 1099). He is said to have studied at Cordova, and this\r\ntradition is confirmed by his elaborate and enthusiastic description of\r\nthat city in his geography. From this work we know that he had visited,\r\nat some period of his life before A.D. 1154, both Lisbon and the mines\r\nof Andalusia. He had also once resided near Morocco city, and once was\r\nat (Algerian) Constantine. More precisely, he tells us that in A.D. 1117\r\nhe went to see the cave of the Seven Sleepers at Ephesus; he probably\r\ntravelled extensively in Asia Minor. From doubtful readings in his text\r\nsome have inferred that he had seen part of the coasts of France and\r\nEngland. We do not know when Roger II. of Sicily (1101-1154) invited him\r\nto his court, but it must have been between 1125 and 1150. Idrisi made\r\nfor the Norman king a celestial sphere and a disk representing the known\r\nworld of his day--both in silver. These only absorbed one-third of the\r\nmetal that had been given him for the work, but Roger bestowed on him\r\nthe remaining two-thirds as a present, adding to this 100,000 pieces of\r\nmoney and the cargo of a richly-laden ship from Barcelona. Roger next\r\nenlisted Idrisi's services in the compilation of a fresh description of\r\nthe \"inhabited earth\" from observation, and not merely from books. The\r\nking and his geographer chose emissaries whom they sent out into various\r\ncountries to observe, record and design; as they returned, Idrisi\r\ninserted in the new geography the information they brought. Thus was\r\ngradually completed (by the month of Shawwal, A.H. 548 = mid-January,\r\nA.D. 1154), the famous work, best known, from its patron and originator,\r\nas _Al Rojari_, but whose fullest title seems to have been, _The going\r\nout of a Curious Man to explore the Regions of the Globe, its Provinces,\r\nIslands, Cities and their Dimensions and Situation_. This has been\r\nabbreviated to _The Amusement of him who desires to traverse the Earth_,\r\nor _The Relaxation of a Curious Mind_. The title of _Nubian Geography_,\r\nbased upon Sionita and Hezronita's misreading of a passage relating to\r\nNubia and the Nile, is entirely unwarranted and misleading. The\r\n_Rogerian Treatise_ contains a full description of the world as far as\r\nit was known to the author. The \"inhabited earth\" is divided into seven\r\n\"climates,\" beginning at the equinoctial line, and extending northwards\r\nto the limit at which the earth was supposed to be rendered\r\nuninhabitable by cold. Each climate is then divided by perpendicular\r\nlines into eleven equal parts, beginning with the western coast of\r\nAfrica and ending with the eastern coast of Asia. The whole world is\r\nthus formed into seventy-seven equal square compartments. The geographer\r\nbegins with the first part of the first climate, including the\r\nwesternmost part of the Sahara and a small (north-westerly) section of\r\nthe Sudan (of which a vague knowledge had now been acquired by the\r\nMoslems of Barbary), and thence proceeds eastward through the different\r\ndivisions of this climate till he finds its termination in the Sea of\r\nChina. He then returns to the first part of the second climate, and so\r\nproceeds till he reaches the eleventh part of the seventh climate, which\r\nterminates in north-east Asia, as he conceives that continent. The\r\ninconveniences of the arrangement (ignoring all divisions, physical,\r\npolitical, linguistic or religious, which did not coincide with those of\r\nhis \"climates\") are obvious.\r\n\r\nThough Idrisi was in such close relations with one of the most civilized\r\nof Christian courts and states, we find few traces of his influence on\r\nEuropean thought and knowledge. The chief exception is perhaps in the\r\ndelineation of Africa in the world-maps of Marino Sanuto (q.v.) and\r\nPietro Vesconte. His account of the voyage of the _Maghrurin_ or\r\n\"Deceived Men\" of Lisbon in the Atlantic (a voyage on which they seem to\r\nhave visited Madeira and one of the Canaries) may have had some effect in\r\nstimulating the later ocean enterprise of Christian mariners; but we have\r\nno direct evidence of this. Idrisi's Ptolemaic leanings give a distinctly\r\nretrograde character to certain parts of his work, such as east Africa\r\nand south Asia; and, in spite of the record of the Lisbon Wanderers, he\r\nfully shares the common Moslem dread of the black, viscous, stormy and\r\nwind-swept waters of the western ocean, whose limits no one knew, and\r\nover which thick and perpetual darkness brooded. At the same time his\r\nbreadth of view, his clear recognition of scientific truths (such as the\r\nroundness of the world) and his wide knowledge and intelligent\r\napplication of preceding work (such as that of Ptolemy, Masudi and Al\r\nJayhani) must not be forgotten. He also preserves and embodies a\r\nconsiderable amount of private and special information--especially as to\r\nScandinavia (in whose delineation he far surpasses his predecessors),\r\nportions of the African coast, the river Niger (whose name is perhaps\r\nfirst to be found, after Ptolemy's doubtful Nigeir, in Idrisi), portions\r\nof the African coast, Egypt, Syria, Italy, France, the Adriatic\r\nshore-lands, Germany and the Atlantic islands. No other Arabic work\r\ncontains a larger assortment of valuable geographical facts;\r\nunfortunately the place-names are often illegible or hopelessly corrupted\r\nin the manuscripts. Idrisi's world-map, with all its shortcomings, is\r\nperhaps the best product of that strangely feeble thing--the Mahommedan\r\ncartography of the middle ages.\r\n\r\nBesides the _Rojari_, Idrisi wrote another work, largely geographical,\r\ncited by Abulfida as _The Book of Kingdoms_, but apparently entitled by\r\nits author _The Gardens of Humanity and the Amusement of the Soul_. This\r\nwas composed for William the Bad (1154-1166), son and successor of Roger\r\nII., but is now lost. He likewise wrote, according to Ibn Said, on\r\n_Medicaments_, and composed verses, which are referred to by the\r\nSicilian Mahommedan poet Ibn Bashrun.\r\n\r\n  Two manuscripts of Idrisi exist in the Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris,\r\n  and other two in the Bodleian Library, Oxford. One of the English\r\n  MSS., brought from Egypt by Greaves, is illustrated by a map of the\r\n  known world, and by thirty-three sectional maps (for each part of the\r\n  first three climates). The second manuscript, brought by Pococke from\r\n  Syria, bears the date of A.H. 906, or A.D. 1500. It consists of 320\r\n  leaves, and is illustrated by one general and seventy-seven particular\r\n  maps, the latter consequently including all the parts of every\r\n  climate. The general map was published by Dr Vincent in his _Periplus\r\n  of the Erythraean Sea_. A copy of Idrisi's work in the Escorial was\r\n  destroyed by the fire of 1671.\r\n\r\n  An epitome of Idrisi's geography, in the original Arabic, was printed,\r\n  with many errors, in 1592 at the Medicean press in Rome, from a MS.\r\n  preserved in the Grand Ducal library at Florence (_De geographia\r\n  universali. Hortulus cultissimus ..._ ). Even the description of Mecca\r\n  is here omitted. Pococke supplied it from his MS. In many\r\n  bibliographical works this impression has been wrongly characterized\r\n  as one of the rarest of books. In 1619 two Maronite scholars, Gabriel\r\n  Sionita, and Joannes Hezronita, published at Paris a Latin translation\r\n  of this epitome (_Geographia Nubiensis, id est, accuratissima totius\r\n  orbis in VII. climata divisi descriptio_). Besides its many\r\n  inaccuracies of detail, this edition, by its unlucky title of _Nubian\r\n  Geography_, started a fresh and fundamental error as to Idrisi's\r\n  origin; this was founded on a misreading of a passage where Idrisi\r\n  describes the Nile passing into Egypt through Nubia--not \"_terram\r\n  nostram_,\" as this version gives, but \"_terram illius_\" is here the\r\n  true translation. George Hieronymus Velschius, a German scholar, had\r\n  prepared a copy of the Arabic original, with a Latin translation,\r\n  which he purposed to have illustrated with notes; but death\r\n  interrupted this design, and his manuscript remains in the university\r\n  library of Jena. Casiri (_Bib. Ar. Hisp._ ii. 13) mentions that he had\r\n  determined to re-edit this work, but he appears never to have executed\r\n  his intention. The part relating to Africa was ably edited by Johann\r\n  Melchior Hartmann (_Commentatio de geographia Africae Edrisiana_,\r\n  Göttingen, 1791, and _Edrisii Africa_, Göttingen, 1796), Here are\r\n  collected the notices of each region in other Moslem writers, so as to\r\n  form, for the time, a fairly complete body of Arabic geography as to\r\n  Africa. Hartmann afterwards published Idrisi's Spain (_Hispania_,\r\n  Marburg, 3 vols., 1802-1818).\r\n\r\n  An (indifferent) French translation of the whole of Idrisi's geography\r\n  (the only complete version which has yet appeared), based on one of\r\n  the MSS. of the Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris, was published by Amédée\r\n  Jaubert in 1836-1840, and forms volumes v. and vi. of the _Recueil de\r\n  voyages_ issued by the Paris Société de Géographie; but a good and\r\n  complete edition of the original text is still a desideratum. A number\r\n  of Oriental scholars at Leiden determined in 1861 to undertake the\r\n  task. Spain and western Europe were assigned to Dozy; eastern Europe\r\n  and western Asia to Engelmann; central and eastern Asia to Defrémery;\r\n  and Africa to de Goeje. The first portion of the work appeared in\r\n  1866, under the title of _Description de l'Afrique et de l'Espagne par\r\n  Edrisi, texte arabe, publié avec une traduction, des notes et un\r\n  glossaire par R. Dozy et M. J. de Goeje_ (Leiden, E. J. Brill, 1866);\r\n  but the other collaborators did not furnish their quota. Other parts\r\n  of Idrisi's work have been separately edited; e.g. \"Spain\"\r\n  (_Descripcion de España de ... Aledris_), by J. A. Condé, in Arabic\r\n  and Spanish (Madrid, 1799); \"Sicily\" (_Descrizione della Sicilia ...\r\n  di Elidris_), by P. D. Magri and F. Tardia (Palermo, 1764); \"Italy\"\r\n  (_Italia descritta nel \"libro del Re Ruggero,\" compilato da Edrisi_),\r\n  by M. Amari and C. Schiaparelli, in Arabic and Italian (Rome, 1883);\r\n  \"Syria\" (_Syria descripta a ... El Edrisio ..._ ), by E. F. C.\r\n  Rosenmüller, in Arabic and Latin, 1825, and (_Idrisii ... Syria_), by\r\n  J. Gildemeister (Bonn, 1885) (the last a Beilage to vol. viii. of the\r\n  _Zeitschrift d. deutsch. Palästina-Vereins_). See also M. Casiri,\r\n  _Bibliotheca Arabico-Hispana Escurialensis_ (2 vols., Madrid,\r\n  1760-1770); V. Lagus, \"Idrisii notitiam terrarum Balticarum ex\r\n  commerciis Scandinavorum et Italorum ... ortam esse\" in _Atti del IV°\r\n  Congresso internaz. degli orientalisti in Firenze_, p. 395 (Florence,\r\n  1880); R. A. Brandel \"Om och ur den arabiske geografen Idrisi,\" _Akad.\r\n  afhand._ (Upsala, 1894).     (C. R. B.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIDUMAEA ([Greek: 'Idoumaia]), the Greek equivalent of Edom ([Hebrew:\r\nEdom]), a territory which, in the works of the Biblical writers, is\r\nconsidered to lie S.E. of the Dead Sea, between the land of Moab and the\r\nGulf of Akaba. Its name, which is connected with the root meaning \"red,\"\r\nis probably applied in reference to the red sandstone ranges of the\r\nmountains of Petra.[1] This etymology, however, is not certain. The\r\napparently theophorous name Obed-Edom (2 Sam. vi. 10) shows that Edom is\r\nthe name of a divinity. Of this there is other evidence; a Leiden\r\npapyrus names Etum as the wife of the Semitic fire-god Reshpu.\r\n\r\nThe early history of Edom is hidden in darkness. The Egyptian references\r\nto it are few, and do not give us much light regarding its early\r\ninhabitants. In the early records of the Pentateuch, the country is\r\noften referred to by the name of Seir, the general name for the whole\r\nrange of mountains on the east side of the Jordan-Araba depression south\r\nof the Dead Sea. These mountains were occupied, so early as we can find\r\nany record, by a cave-dwelling aboriginal race known as Horites, who\r\nwere smitten by the much-discussed king Chedorlaomer (Gen. xiv. 6) and\r\naccording to Deut. ii. 22 were driven out by the Semitic tribes of\r\nEsau's descendants. The Horites are to us little more than a name,\r\nthough the discovery of cave-dwellers of very early date at Gezer in the\r\nexcavations of 1902-1905 has enabled us to form some idea as to their\r\nprobable culture-status and physical character.\r\n\r\nThe occupants of Edom during practically the whole period of Biblical\r\nhistory were the Bedouin tribes which claimed descent through Esau from\r\nAbraham, and were acknowledged by the Israelites (Deut. xxiii. 7) as\r\nkin. That they intermarried with the earlier stock is suggested by the\r\npassage in Gen. xxxvi. 2, naming, as one of the wives of Esau,\r\nOholibamah, daughter of Zibeon the Horite (corrected by verse 20). Among\r\nthe peculiarities of the Edomites was government by certain officials\r\nknown as [Hebrew: alufim][2] which the English versions (by too close a\r\nreminiscence of the Vulgate _duces_) translate \"dukes.\" The now\r\nnaturalized word \"sheikhs\" would be the exact rendering. In addition to\r\nthis Bedouin organization there was the curious institution of an\r\nelective monarchy, some of whose kings are catalogued in Gen. xxxvi.\r\n31-39 and 1 Chron. i. 43-54. These kings reigned at some date anterior\r\nto the time of Saul. No deductions as to their chronology can be based\r\non the silence regarding them in Moses' song, Exodus xv. 15. There was a\r\nking in Edom (Num. xx. 14) who refused passage to the Israelites in\r\ntheir wanderings.\r\n\r\nThe history of the relations of the Edomites and Israelites may be\r\nbriefly summarized. Saul, whose chief herdsman, Doeg, was an Edomite (1\r\nSam. xxi. 7), fought successfully against them (1 Sam. xiv. 47). Joab (1\r\nKings xi. 16) or Abishai, as his deputy (1 Chron. xviii. 11, 13),\r\noccupied Edom for six months and devastated it; it was garrisoned and\r\npermanently held by David (2 Sam. viii. 14). But a refugee named Hadad,\r\nwho escaped as a child to Egypt and grew up at the court of the Egyptian\r\nking, returned in Solomon's reign and made a series of reprisal raids on\r\nthe Israelite territory (1 Kings xi. 14). This did not prevent Solomon\r\nintroducing Edomites into his harem (1 Kings xi. 1) and maintaining a\r\nnavy at Ezion-geber, at the head of the Gulf of Akaba (1 Kings ix. 26).\r\nIndeed, until the time of Jehoram, when the land revolted (2 Kings viii.\r\n20, 22), Edom was a dependency of Judah, ruled by a viceroy (1 Kings\r\nxxii. 47). An attempt at recovering their independence was temporarily\r\nquelled in a campaign by Amaziah (2 Kings xiv. 7), and Azariah his\r\nsuccessor was able to renew the sea trade of the Gulf of Akaba (2 Kings\r\nxiv. 22) which had probably languished since the wreck of Jehoshaphat's\r\nships (1 Kings xxii. 48); but the ancient kingdom had been\r\nre-established by the time of Ahaz, and the king's name, Kaush-Malak, is\r\nrecorded by Tiglath Pileser. He made raids on the territory of Judah (2\r\nChron. xxviii. 17). The kingdom, however, was short-lived, and it was\r\nsoon absorbed into the vassalage of Assyria.\r\n\r\nThe later history of Edom is curious. By the constant westward pressure\r\nof the eastern Arabs, which (after the restraining force of the great\r\nMesopotamian kingdoms was weakened) assumed irresistible strength, the\r\nancient Edomites were forced across the Jordan-Araba depression, and\r\nwith their name migrated to the south of western Palestine. In 1\r\nMaccabees v. 65 we find them at Hebron, and this is one of the first\r\nindications that we discover of the cis-Jordanic Idumaea of Josephus and\r\nthe Talmud.\r\n\r\nJosephus used the name Idumaea as including not only Gobalitis, the\r\noriginal Mount Seir, but also Amalekitis, the land of Amalek, west of\r\nthis, and Akrabatine, the ancient Acrabbim, S.W. of the Dead Sea. In\r\n_War_ IV. viii. 1, he mentions two villages \"in the very midst of\r\nIdumaea,\" named Betaris and Caphartobas. The first of these is the\r\nmodern Beit Jibrin (see ELEUTHEROPOLIS), the second is Tuffuh, near\r\nHebron. Jerome describes Idumaea as extending from Beit Jibrin to Petra,\r\nand ascribes the great caves at the former place to cave-dwellers like\r\nthe aboriginal Horites. Ptolemy's account presents us with the last\r\nstage, in which the name Idumaea is entirely restricted to the\r\ncis-Jordanic district, and the old trans-Jordanic region is absorbed in\r\nArabia.\r\n\r\nThe Idumaean Antipater was appointed by Julius Caesar procurator of\r\nJudaea, Samaria and Galilee, as a reward for services rendered against\r\nPompey. He was the father of Herod the Great, whose family thus was\r\nIdumaean in origin. (See PALESTINE.)     (R. A. S. M.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [1] A curious etymological speculation connects the name with the\r\n    story of Esau's begging for Jacob's pottage, Gen. xxv. 30.\r\n\r\n  [2] The same word is used in the anonymous prophecy incorporated in\r\n    the book of Zachariah (xii. 5), and in one or two other places as\r\n    well, of _Hebrew_ leaders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIDUN, or IDUNA, in Scandinavian mythology, the goddess of youth and\r\nspring. She was daughter of the dwarf Svald and wife of Bragi. She was\r\nkeeper of the golden apples, the eating of which preserved to the gods\r\ntheir eternal youth. Loki, the evil spirit, kidnapped her and the\r\napples, but was forced by the gods to restore her liberty. Idun\r\npersonifies the year between March and September, and her myth\r\nrepresents the annual imprisonment of spring by winter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIDYL, or IDYLL (Gr. [Greek: eidyllion], a descriptive piece, from\r\n[Greek: eidos], a shape or style; Lat. _idyllium_), a short poem of a\r\npastoral or rural character, in which something of the element of\r\nlandscape is preserved or felt. The earliest commentators of antiquity\r\nused the term to designate a great variety of brief and homely poems, in\r\nwhich the description of natural objects was introduced, but the\r\npastoral idea came into existence in connexion with the Alexandrian\r\nschool, and particularly with Theocritus, Bion and Moschus, in the 3rd\r\ncentury before Christ. It appears, however, that [Greek: eidyllion] was\r\nnot, even then, used consciously as the name of a form of verse, but as\r\na diminutive of [Greek: eidos], and merely signified \"a little piece in\r\nthe style of\" whatever adjective might follow. Thus the idyls of the\r\npastoral poets were [Greek: eidyllia aipolika], little pieces in the\r\ngoatherd style. We possess ten of the so-called \"Idyls\" of Theocritus,\r\nand these are the type from which the popular idea of this kind of poem\r\nis taken. But it is observable that there is nothing in the technical\r\ncharacter of these ten very diverse pieces which leads us to suppose\r\nthat the poet intended them to be regarded as typical. In fact, if he\r\nhad been asked whether a poem was or was not an idyl he would doubtless\r\nhave been unable to comprehend the question. As a matter of fact, the\r\nfirst of his poems, the celebrated \"Dirge for Daphnis,\" has become the\r\nprototype, not of the modern idyl, but of the modern elegy, and the not\r\nless famous \"Festival of Adonis\" is a realistic mime. It was the six\r\nlittle epical romances, if they may be so called, which started the\r\nconception of the idyl of Theocritus. It must be remembered, however,\r\nthat there is nothing in ancient literature which justifies the notion\r\nof a form of verse recognized as an \"idyl.\" In the 4th century after\r\nChrist the word seems to have become accepted in Latin as covering short\r\ndescriptive poems of very diverse characters, for the early MSS. of\r\nAusonius contain a section of \"Edyllia,\" which embraces some of the most\r\nadmirable of the miscellaneous pieces of that writer. But that Ausonius\r\nhimself called his poems \"idyls\" is highly doubtful. Indeed, it is not\r\ncertain that the heading is not a mistake for \"Epyllia.\" The word was\r\nrevived at the Renaissance and applied rather vaguely to Latin and Greek\r\nimitations of Theocritus and of Virgil. It was also applied to modern\r\npoems of a romantic and pastoral character published by such writers as\r\nTasso in Italy, Montemayor in Portugal and Ronsard in French. In 1658\r\nthe English critic, Edward Phillips, defined an \"idyl\" as \"a kind of\r\neclogue,\" but it was seldom used to describe a modern poem. Mme\r\nDeshoulières published a series of seven _Idylles_ in 1675, and Boileau\r\nmakes a vague reference to the form. The sentimental German idyls of\r\nSalomon Gessner (in prose, 1758) and Voss (in hexameters, 1800) were\r\nmodelled on Theocritus. Goethe's _Alexis und Dora_ is an idyl. It\r\nappears that the very general use, or abuse, of the word in the second\r\nhalf of the 19th century, both in English and French, arises from the\r\npopularity of two works, curiously enough almost identical in date, by\r\ntwo eminent and popular poets. The _Idylles héroïques_ (1858) of Victor\r\nde Laprade and the _Idylls_ of the King (1859) of Tennyson enjoyed a\r\nsuccess in either country which led to a wide imitation of the title\r\namong those who had, perhaps, a very inexact idea of its meaning. Among\r\nmodern Germans, Berthold Auerbach and Jeremias Gotthelf have been\r\nprominent as the composers of sentimental idyls founded on anecdotes of\r\nvillage-life. On the whole, it is impossible to admit that the idyl has\r\na place among definite literary forms. Its character is vague and has\r\noften been purely sentimental, and our conception of it is further\r\nobscured by the fact that though the noun carries no bucolic idea with\r\nit in English, the adjective (\"idyllic\") has come to be synonymous with\r\npastoral and rustic.     (E. G.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIFFLAND, AUGUST WILHELM (1759-1814), German actor and dramatic author,\r\nwas born at Hanover on the 19th of April 1759. His father intended his\r\nson to be a clergyman, but the boy preferred the stage, and at eighteen\r\nran away to Gotha in order to prepare himself for a theatrical career.\r\nHe was fortunate enough to receive instruction from Hans Ekhof, and made\r\nsuch rapid progress that he was able in 1779 to accept an engagement at\r\nthe theatre in Mannheim, then rising into prominence. He soon stood high\r\nin his profession, and extended his reputation by frequently playing in\r\nother towns. In 1796 he settled in Berlin, where he became director of\r\nthe national theatre of Prussia; and in 1811 he was made general\r\ndirector of all representations before royalty. Iffland produced the\r\nclassical works of Goethe and Schiller with conscientious care; but he\r\nhad little understanding for the drama of the romantic writers. The form\r\nof play in which he was most at home, both as actor and playwright, was\r\nthe domestic drama, the sentimental play of everyday life. His works are\r\nalmost entirely destitute of imagination; but they display a thorough\r\nmastery of the technical necessities of the stage, and a remarkable\r\npower of devising effective situations. His best characters are simple\r\nand natural, fond of domestic life, but too much given to the utterance\r\nof sentimental commonplace. His best-known plays are _Die Jäger_,\r\n_Dienstpflicht_, _Die Advokaten_, _Die Mündel_ and _Die Hagestolzen_.\r\nIffland was also a dramatic critic, and German actors place high value\r\non the reasonings and hints respecting their art in his _Almanach für\r\nTheater und Theaterfreunde_. In 1798-1802 he issued his _Dramatischen\r\nWerke_ in 16 volumes, to which he added an autobiography (_Meine\r\ntheatralische Laufbahn_). In 1807-1809 Iffland brought out two volumes\r\nof _Neue dramatische Werke_. Selections from his writings were\r\nafterwards published, one in 11 (Leipzig, 1827-1828), the other in 10\r\nvolumes (Leipzig, 1844, and again 1860). As an actor, he was conspicuous\r\nfor his brilliant portrayal of comedy parts. His fine gentlemen,\r\npolished men of the world, and distinguished princes were models of\r\nperfection, and showed none of the traces of elaborate study which were\r\nnoticed in his interpretation of tragedy. He especially excelled in\r\npresenting those types of middle-class life which appear in his own\r\ncomedies. Iffland died at Berlin on the 22nd of September 1814. A bronze\r\nportrait statue of him was erected in front of the Mannheim theatre in\r\n1864.\r\n\r\n  See K.

Iffland's interesting autobiography, _Meine theatralische\r\n  Laufbahn_, was republished by H. Holstein in 1885.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIGLAU (Czech _Jihlava_), a town of Austria, in Moravia, 56 m.

Among the principal buildings are\r\nthe churches of St Jakob, St Ignatius, St John and St Paul, the\r\ntown-hall, and the barracks formed from a monastery suppressed under the\r\nemperor Joseph II. There is also a fine cemetery, containing some\r\nremarkable monuments. It has the principal tobacco and cigar factory of\r\nthe state monopoly, which employs about 2500 hands, and has besides a\r\nlarge and important textile and glass industry, corn and saw-mills,\r\npottery and brewing. Fairs are periodically held in the town; and the\r\ntrade in timber, cereals, and linen and woollen goods is generally\r\nbrisk.\r\n\r\nIglau is an old mining town where, according to legend, the silver mines\r\nwere worked so early as 799. King Ottakar I. (1198-1230) established\r\nhere a mining-office and a mint. At a very early date it enjoyed\r\nexceptional privileges, which were confirmed by King Wenceslaus I. in\r\nthe year 1250. The town-hall contains a collection of municipal and\r\nmining laws dating as far back as 1389. At Iglau, on the 5th of July\r\n1436, the treaty was made with the Hussites, by which the emperor\r\nSigismund was acknowledged king of Bohemia. A granite column near the\r\ntown marks the spot where Ferdinand I., in 1527, swore fidelity to the\r\nBohemian states. During the Thirty Years' War Iglau was twice captured\r\nby the Swedes. In 1742 it fell into the hands of the Prussians, and in\r\nDecember 1805 the Bavarians under Wrede were defeated near the town.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIGLESIAS, a town and episcopal see of Sardinia in the province of\r\nCagliari, from which it is 34 m. W.N.W. by rail, 620 ft. above\r\nsea-level. Pop. (1901) 10,436 (town), 20,874 (commune). It is finely\r\nsituated among the mountains in the S.W. portion of the island, and is\r\nchiefly important as the centre of a mining district; it has a\r\ngovernment school for mining engineers. The minerals are conveyed by a\r\nsmall railway via Monteponi (with its large lead and zinc mine) to\r\nPortovesme (15 m. S.W. of Iglesias in the sheltered gulf of Carloforte),\r\nnear Portoscuso, where they are shipped. The total amount of the\r\nminerals extracted in Sardinia in 1905 was 170,236 tons and their value\r\n£765,054 (chiefly consisting of 99,749 tons of calamine zinc, 26,051 of\r\nblende zinc, 24,798 tons of lead and 15,429 tons of lignite): the\r\ngreater part of them--118,009 tons--was exported from Portoscuso by sea\r\nand most of the rest from Cagliari, the zinc going mainly to Antwerp,\r\nand in a less proportion to Bordeaux and Dunkirk, while the lead is sent\r\nto Pertusola near Spezia, to be smelted. At Portoscuso is also a tunny\r\nfishery.\r\n\r\nThe cathedral of Iglesias, built by the Pisans, has a good façade\r\n(restored); the interior is late Spanish Gothic. San Francesco is a fine\r\nGothic church with a gallery over the entrance, while Sta Chiara and the\r\nchurch of the Capuchins (the former dating from 1285) show a transition\r\nbetween Romanesque and Gothic. The battlemented town walls are well\r\npreserved and picturesque; the castle, built in 1325, now contains a\r\nglass factory. The church of Nostra Signora del Buon Cammino above the\r\ntown (1080 ft.) commands a fine view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIGNATIEV, NICHOLAS PAVLOVICH, COUNT (1832-1908), Russian diplomatist,\r\nwas born at St Petersburg on the 29th of January 1832. His father,\r\nCaptain Paul Ignatiev, had been taken into favour by the tsar Nicholas\r\nI., owing to his fidelity on the occasion of the military conspiracy in\r\n1825; and the grand duke Alexander (afterwards tsar) stood sponsor at\r\nthe boy's baptism. At the age of seventeen he became an officer of the\r\nGuards. His diplomatic career began at the congress of Paris, after the\r\nCrimean War, where he took an active part as military attaché in the\r\nnegotiations regarding the rectification of the Russian frontier on the\r\nLower Danube. Two years later (1858) he was sent with a small escort on\r\na dangerous mission to Khiva and Bokhara. The khan of Khiva laid a plan\r\nfor detaining him as a hostage, but he eluded the danger and returned\r\nsafely, after concluding with the khan of Bokhara a treaty of\r\nfriendship. His next diplomatic exploit was in the Far East, as\r\nplenipotentiary to the court of Peking. When the Chinese government was\r\nterrified by the advance of the Anglo-French expedition of 1860 and the\r\nburning of the Summer Palace, he worked on their fears so dexterously\r\nthat he obtained for Russia not only the left bank of the Amur, the\r\noriginal object of the mission, but also a large extent of territory and\r\nsea-coast south of that river. This success was supposed to prove his\r\ncapacity for dealing with Orientals, and paved his way to the post of\r\nambassador at Constantinople, which he occupied from 1864 till 1877.\r\nHere his chief aim was to liberate from Turkish domination and bring\r\nunder the influence of Russia the Christian nationalities in general and\r\nthe Bulgarians in particular. His restless activity in this field,\r\nmostly of a semi-official and secret character, culminated in the\r\nRusso-Turkish war of 1877-1878, at the close of which he negotiated with\r\nthe Turkish plenipotentiaries the treaty of San Stefano. As the war\r\nwhich he had done so much to bring about did not eventually secure for\r\nRussia advantages commensurate with the sacrifices involved, he fell\r\ninto disfavour, and retired from active service. Shortly after the\r\naccession of Alexander III. in 1881, he was appointed minister of the\r\ninterior on the understanding that he would carry out a nationalist,\r\nreactionary policy, but his shifty ways and his administrative\r\nincapacity so displeased his imperial master that he was dismissed in\r\nthe following year. After that time he exercised no important influence\r\nin public affairs. He died on the 3rd of July 1908.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIGNATIUS ([Greek: Ignatios]), bishop of Antioch, one of the \"Apostolic\r\nFathers.\" No one connected with the history of the early Christian\r\nChurch is more famous than Ignatius, and yet among the leading churchmen\r\nof the time there is scarcely one about whose career we know so little.\r\nOur only trustworthy information is derived from the letters which he\r\nwrote to various churches on his last journey from Antioch to Rome, and\r\nfrom the short epistle of Polycarp to the Philippians. The earlier\r\npatristic writers seem to have known no more than we do. Irenaeus, for\r\ninstance, gives a quotation from his Epistle to the Romans and does not\r\nappear to know (or if he knew he has forgotten) the name of the author,\r\nsince he describes him (_Adv. haer._ v. 28. 4) as \"one of those\r\nbelonging to us\" ([Greek: tis tôn hêmeterôn]). If Eusebius possessed any\r\nknowledge about Ignatius apart from the letters he never reveals it. The\r\nonly shred of extra information which he gives us is the statement that\r\nIgnatius \"was the second successor of Peter in the bishopric of Antioch\"\r\n(_Eccles. hist._ iii. 36). Of course in later times a cloud of tradition\r\narose, but none of it bears the least evidence of trustworthiness. The\r\nmartyrologies, from which the account of his martyrdom that used to\r\nappear in uncritical church histories is taken, are full of anachronisms\r\nand impossibilities. There are two main types--the Roman and the\r\nSyrian--out of which the others are compounded. They contradict each\r\nother in many points and even their own statements in different places\r\nare sometimes quite irreconcilable. Any truth that the narrative may\r\ncontain is hopelessly overlaid with fiction. We are therefore limited to\r\nthe Epistles for our information, and before we can use even these we\r\nare confronted with a most complex critical problem, a problem which for\r\nages aroused the most bitter controversy, but which happily now, thanks\r\nto the labours of Zahn, Lightfoot, Harnack and Funk, may be said to have\r\nreached a satisfactory solution.\r\n\r\nI. _The Problem of the Three Recensions._--The Ignatian problem arises\r\nfrom the fact that we possess three different recensions of the\r\nEpistles. (a) _The short recension_ (often called the Vossian) contains\r\nthe letters to the Ephesians, Magnesians, Trallians, Romans,\r\nPhiladelphians, Smyrnaeans and to Polycarp. This recension was derived\r\nin its Greek form from the famous Medicean MS. at Florence and first\r\npublished by Vossius in 1646 (see _Theol. Literaturzeitung_, 1906, 596\r\nf., for an early papyrus fragment in the Berlin Museum, containing _Ad\r\nSmyrn._ iii. fin. xii. init.). In the Medicean MS. the Epistle to the\r\nRomans is missing, but a Greek version of this epistle was discovered by\r\nRuinart, embedded in a _martyrium_, in the National Library at Paris and\r\npublished in 1689. There are also (1) a Latin version made by Robert\r\nGrosseteste, bishop of Lincoln, about 1250, and published by Ussher in\r\n1644--two years before the Vossian edition appeared; (2) an Armenian\r\nversion which was derived from a Syriac not earlier than the 5th century\r\nand published at Constantinople in 1783; (3) some fragments of a Syriac\r\nversion published in Cureton's edition of Ignatius; (4) fragments of a\r\nCoptic version first published in Lightfoot's work (ii. 859-882). (b)\r\n_The long recension_ contains the seven Epistles mentioned above in an\r\nexpanded form and several additional letters besides. The Greek form of\r\nthe recension, which has been preserved in ten MSS., has thirteen\r\nletters, the additional ones being to the Tarsians, the Philippians, the\r\nAntiochians, to Hero, to Mary of Cassobola and a letter of Mary to\r\nIgnatius. The Latin form, of which there are thirteen extant MSS., omits\r\nthe letter of Mary of Cassobola, but adds to the list the Laus Heronis,\r\ntwo Epistles to the apostle John, one to the Virgin Mary and one from\r\nMary to Ignatius. (c) _The Syriac or Curetonian recension_ contains only\r\nthree Epistles, viz. to Polycarp, to the Romans, and to the Ephesians,\r\nand these when compared with the same letters in the short and long\r\nrecensions are found to be considerably abbreviated. The Syriac\r\nrecension was made by William Cureton in 1845 from three Syriac MSS.\r\nwhich had recently been brought from the Nitrian desert and deposited\r\nin the British Museum. One of these MSS. belongs to the 6th century, the\r\nother two are later. Summed up in a word, therefore, the Ignatian\r\nproblem is this: which of these three recensions (if any) represents the\r\nactual work of Ignatius?\r\n\r\nII. _History of the Controversy._--The history of the controversy may be\r\ndivided into three periods: (a) up to the discovery of the short\r\nrecension in 1646; (b) between 1646 and the discovery of the Syriac\r\nrecension in 1845; (c) from 1845 to the present day. In the first stage\r\nthe controversy was theological rather than critical. The Reformation\r\nraised the question as to the authority of the papacy and the hierarchy.\r\nRoman Catholic scholars used the interpolated Ignatian Epistles very\r\nfreely in their defence and derived many of their arguments from them,\r\nwhile Protestant scholars threw discredit on these Epistles. The\r\nMagdeburg centuriators expressed the gravest doubts as to their\r\ngenuineness, and Calvin declared that \"nothing was more foul than those\r\nfairy tales (_naeniis_) published under the name of Ignatius!\" It should\r\nbe stated, however, that one Roman Catholic scholar, Denys Petau\r\n(Petavius), admitted that the letters were interpolated, while the\r\nProtestant Vedelius acknowledged the seven letters mentioned by\r\nEusebius. In England the Ignatian Epistles took an important place in\r\nthe episcopalian controversy in the 17th century. Their genuineness was\r\ndefended by the leading Anglican writers, e.g. Whitgift, Hooker and\r\nAndrewes, and vigorously challenged by Dissenters, e.g. the five\r\nPresbyterian ministers who wrote under the name of Smectymnuus and John\r\nMilton.[1] The second period is marked by the recognition of the\r\nsuperiority of the Vossian recension. This was speedily demonstrated,\r\nthough some attempts were made, notably by Jean Morin or Morinus (about\r\n1656), Whiston (in 1711) and Meier (in 1836), to resuscitate the long\r\nrecension. Many Protestants still maintained that the new recension,\r\nlike the old, was a forgery. The chief attack came from Jean Daillé, who\r\nin his famous work (1666) drew up no fewer than sixty-six objections to\r\nthe genuineness of the Ignatian literature. He was answered by Pearson,\r\nwho in his _Vindiciae epistolarum S. Ignatii_ (1672) completely\r\nvindicated the authenticity of the Vossian Epistles. No further attack\r\nof any importance was made till the time of Baur, who like Daillé\r\nrejected both recensions. In the third stage--inaugurated in 1845 by\r\nCureton's work--the controversy has ranged round the relative claims of\r\nthe Vossian and the Curetonian recensions. Scholars have been divided\r\ninto three camps, viz. (1) those who followed Cureton in maintaining\r\nthat the three Syriac Epistles alone were the genuine work of Ignatius.\r\nAmong them may be mentioned the names of Bunsen, A. Ritschl, R. A.\r\nLipsius, E. de Pressensé, H. Ewald, Milman, Bohringer. (2) Those who\r\naccepted the genuineness of the Vossian recension and regarded the\r\nCuretonian as an abbreviation of it, e.g. Petermann, Denzinger, Uhlhorn,\r\nMerx, and in more recent times Th. Zahn, J. B. Lightfoot, Ad. Harnack\r\nand F. X. Funk. (3) Those who denied the authenticity of both\r\nrecensions, e.g. Baur and Hilgenfeld and in recent times van Manen,[2]\r\nVölter[3] and van Loon.[4] The result of more than half a century's\r\ndiscussion has been to restore the Vossian recension to the premier\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nIII. _The Origin of the Long Recension._--The arguments against the\r\ngenuineness of the long recension are decisive. (1) It conflicts with\r\nthe statement of Eusebius. (2) The first trace of its use occurs in\r\nAnastasius of Antioch (A.D. 598) and Stephen Gobarus (c. 575-600). (3)\r\nThe ecclesiastical system of the letters implies a date not earlier than\r\nthe 4th century. (4) The recension has been proved to be dependent on\r\nthe _Apostolical Constitutions_. (5) The doctrinal atmosphere implies\r\nthe existence of Arian and Apollinarian heresies. (6) The added passages\r\nreveal a difference in style which stamps them at once as\r\ninterpolations. There are several different theories with regard to the\r\norigin of the recension. Some, e.g. Leclerc, Newman and Zahn, think that\r\nthe writer was an Arian and that the additions were made in the interest\r\nof Arianism. Funk, on the other hand, regards the writer as an\r\nApollinarian. Lightfoot opposes both views and suggests that it is\r\nbetter \"to conceive of him as writing with a conciliatory aim.\"\r\n\r\nIV. _The Objections to the Curetonian Recension._--The objections to the\r\nSyriac recension, though not so decisive, are strong enough to carry\r\nconviction with them. (1) We have the express statement of Eusebius that\r\nIgnatius wrote seven Epistles. (2) There are statements in Polycarp's\r\nEpistle which cannot be explained from the three Syriac Epistles. (3)\r\nThe omitted portions are proved by Lightfoot after an elaborate analysis\r\nto be written in the same style as the rest of the epistles and could\r\nnot therefore have been later interpolations. (4) The Curetonian letters\r\nare often abrupt and broken and show signs of abridgment. (5) The\r\ndiscovery of the Armenian version proves the existence of an earlier\r\nSyriac recension corresponding to the Vossian of which the Curetonian\r\nmay be an abbreviation. It seems impossible to account for the origin of\r\nthe Curetonian recension on theological grounds. The theory that the\r\nabridgment was made in the interests of Eutychianism or Monophysitism\r\ncannot be substantiated.\r\n\r\nV. _The Date and Genuineness of the Vossian Epistles._--We are left\r\ntherefore with the seven Epistles. Are they the genuine work of\r\nIgnatius, and, if so, at what date were they written? The main\r\nobjections are as follows: (1) The conveyance of a condemned prisoner to\r\nRome to be put to death in the amphitheatre is unlikely on historical\r\ngrounds, and the route taken is improbable for geographical reasons.\r\nThis objection has very little solid basis. (2) The heresies against\r\nwhich Ignatius contends imply the rise of the later Gnostic and Docetic\r\nsects. It is quite certain, however, that Docetism was in existence in\r\nthe 1st century (cf. 1 John), while many of the principles of Gnosticism\r\nwere in vogue long before the great Gnostic sects arose (cf. the\r\nPastoral Epistles). There is nothing in Ignatius which implies a\r\nknowledge of the teaching of Basilides or Valentinus. In fact, as\r\nHarnack says: \"No Christian writer after 140 could have described the\r\nfalse teachers in the way that Ignatius does.\" (3) The ecclesiastical\r\nsystem of Ignatius is too developed to have arisen as early as the time\r\nof Trajan. At first sight this objection seems to be almost fatal. But\r\nwe have to remember that the bishops of Ignatius are not bishops in the\r\nmodern sense of the word at all, but simply pastors of churches. They\r\nare not mentioned at all in two Epistles, viz. _Romans_ and\r\n_Philippians_, which seems to imply that this form of government was not\r\nuniversal. It is only when we read modern ecclesiastical ideas into\r\nIgnatius that the objection has much weight. To sum up, as Uhlhorn says:\r\n\"The collective mass of internal evidence against the genuineness of the\r\nletters ... is insufficient to counterbalance the testimony of the\r\nEpistle of Polycarp in their favour. He who would prove the Epistles of\r\nIgnatius to be spurious must begin by proving the Epistle of Polycarp to\r\nbe spurious, and such an undertaking is not likely to succeed.\" This\r\nbeing so, there is no reason for rejecting the opinion of Eusebius that\r\nthe Epistles were written in the reign of Trajan. Harnack, who formerly\r\ndated them about 140, now says that they were written in the latter\r\nyears of Trajan, or possibly a little later (117-125). The majority of\r\nscholars place them a few years earlier (110-117).[5]\r\n\r\nThe letters of Ignatius unfortunately, unlike the Epistles of St Paul,\r\ncontain scant autobiographical material. We are told absolutely nothing\r\nabout the history of his career. The fact that like St Paul he describes\r\nhimself as an [Greek: ektrôma] (_Rom._ 9), and that he speaks of himself\r\nas \"the last of the Antiochene Christians\" (_Trall._ 13; _Smyrn._ xi.),\r\nseems to suggest that he had been converted from paganism somewhat late\r\nin life and that the process of conversion had been abrupt and violent.\r\nHe bore the surname of Theophorus, i.e. \"God-clad\" or \"bearing God.\"\r\nLater tradition regarded the word as a passive form (\"God-borne\") and\r\nexplained it by the romantic theory that Ignatius was the child whom\r\nChrist took in his arms (Mark ix. 36-37). The date at which he became\r\nbishop of Antioch cannot be determined. At the time when the Epistles\r\nwere written he had just been sentenced to death, and was being sent in\r\ncharge of a band of soldiers to Rome to fight the beasts in the\r\namphitheatre. The fact that he was condemned to the amphitheatre proves\r\nthat he could not have been a Roman citizen. We lose sight of him at\r\nTroas, but the presumption is that he was martyred at Rome, though we\r\nhave no early evidence of this.\r\n\r\nBut if the Epistles tell us little of the life of Ignatius, they give us\r\nan excellent picture of the man himself, and are a mirror in which we\r\nsee reflected certain ideals of the life and thought of the day.\r\nIgnatius, as Schaff says, \"is the incarnation of three closely connected\r\nideas: the glory of martyrdom, the omnipotence of episcopacy, and the\r\nhatred of heresy and schism.\"\r\n\r\n1. Zeal for martyrdom in later days became a disease in the Church, but\r\nin the case of Ignatius it is the mark of a hero. The heroic note runs\r\nthrough all the Epistles; thus he says:\r\n\r\n  \"I bid all men know that of my own free will I die for God, unless ye\r\n  should hinder me.... Let me be given to the wild beasts, for through\r\n  them I can attain unto God. I am God's wheat, and I am ground by the\r\n  wild beasts that I may be found the pure bread of Christ. Entice the\r\n  wild beasts that they may become my sepulchre...; come fire and cross\r\n  and grapplings with wild beasts, wrenching of bones, hacking of limbs,\r\n  crushings of my whole body; only be it mine to attain unto Jesus\r\n  Christ\" (_Rom._ 4-5).\r\n\r\n2. Ignatius constantly contends for the recognition of the authority of\r\nthe ministers of the church. \"Do nothing,\" he writes to the Magnesians,\r\n\"without the bishop and the presbyters.\" The \"three orders\" are\r\nessential to the church, without them no church is worthy of the name\r\n(cf. _Trall._ 3). \"It is not lawful apart from the bishop either to\r\nbaptize or to hold a love-feast\" (_Smyrn._ 8). Respect is due to the\r\nbishop as to God, to the presbyters as the council of God and the\r\ncollege of apostles, to the deacons as to Jesus Christ (_Trall._ 3).\r\nThese terms must not, of course, be taken in their developed modern\r\nsense. The \"bishop\" of Ignatius seems to represent the modern pastor of\r\na church. As Zahn has shown, Ignatius is not striving to introduce a\r\nspecial form of ministry, nor is he endeavouring to substitute one form\r\nfor another. His particular interest is not so much in the form of\r\nministry as in the unity of the church. It is this that is his chief\r\nconcern. Centrifugal forces were at work. Differences of theological\r\nopinion were arising. Churches had a tendency to split up into sections.\r\nThe age of the apostles had passed away and their successors did not\r\ninherit their authority. The unity of the churches was in danger.\r\nIgnatius was resisting this fatal tendency which threatened ruin to the\r\nfaith. The only remedy for it in those days was to exalt the authority\r\nof the ministry and make it the centre of church life. It should be\r\nnoted that (1) there is no trace of the later doctrine of apostolical\r\nsuccession; (2) the ministry is never sacerdotal in the letters of\r\nIgnatius. As Lightfoot puts it: \"The ecclesiastical order was enforced\r\nby him (Ignatius) almost solely as a security for doctrinal purity. The\r\nthreefold ministry was the husk, the shell, which protected the precious\r\nkernel of the truth\" (i. 40).\r\n\r\n3. Ignatius fights most vehemently against the current forms of heresy.\r\nThe chief danger to the church came from the Docetists who denied the\r\nreality of the humanity of Christ and ascribed to him a phantom body.\r\nHence we find Ignatius laying the utmost stress on the fact that Christ\r\n\"was _truly_ born and ate and drank, was _truly_ persecuted under\r\nPontius Pilate ... was _truly_ raised from the dead\" (_Trall._ 9). \"I\r\nknow that He was in the flesh even after the resurrection, and when He\r\ncame to Peter and his company, He said to them, 'Lay hold and handle me,\r\nand see that I am not an incorporeal spirit'\" (_Smyrn._ 3). Equally\r\nemphatic is Ignatius's protest against a return to Judaism. \"It is\r\nmonstrous to talk of Jesus Christ and to practise Judaism, for\r\nChristianity did not believe in Judaism but Judaism in Christianity\"\r\n(_Magn._ 10).\r\n\r\nReference must also be made to a few of the more characteristic points\r\nin the theology of Ignatius. As far as Christology is concerned,\r\nbesides the insistence on the reality of the humanity of Christ already\r\nmentioned, there are two other points which call for notice. (1)\r\nIgnatius is the earliest writer outside the New Testament to describe\r\nChrist under the categories of current philosophy; cf. the famous\r\npassage in _Eph._ 7, \"There is one only physician, of flesh and of\r\nspirit ([Greek: sarkikos kai pneumatikos]), generate and ingenerate\r\n([Greek: gennêtos kai agennêtos]), God in man, true life in death, son\r\nof Mary and son of God, first passible and then impassible\" ([Greek:\r\nprôton pathêtos kai apathês]). (2) Ignatius is also the first writer\r\noutside the New Testament to mention the Virgin Birth, upon which he\r\nlays the utmost stress. \"Hidden from the prince of this world were the\r\nvirginity of Mary and her child-bearing and likewise also the death of\r\nthe Lord, three mysteries to be cried aloud, the which were wrought in\r\nthe silence of God\" (_Eph._ 19). Here, it will be observed, we have the\r\nnucleus of the later doctrine of the deception of Satan. In regard to\r\nthe Eucharist also later ideas occur in Ignatius. It is termed a [Greek:\r\nmystêrion] (_Trall._ 2), and the influence of the Greek mysteries is\r\nseen in such language as that used in _Eph._ 20, where Ignatius\r\ndescribes the Eucharistic bread as \"the medicine of immortality and the\r\nantidote against death.\" When Ignatius says too that \"the heretics\r\nabstain from Eucharist because they do not allow that the Eucharist is\r\nthe flesh of Christ,\" the words seem to imply that materialistic ideas\r\nwere beginning to find an entrance into the church (_Smyr._ 6). Other\r\npoints that call for special notice are: (1) Ignatius's rather\r\nextravagant angelology. In one place for instance he speaks of himself\r\nas being able to comprehend heavenly things and \"the arrays of angels\r\nand the musterings of principalities\" (_Trall._ 5). (2) His view of the\r\nOld Testament. In one important passage Ignatius emphatically states his\r\nbelief in the supremacy of Christ even over \"the archives\" of the faith,\r\ni.e. the Old Testament: \"As for me, my archives--my inviolable\r\narchives--are Jesus Christ, His cross, His death, His resurrection and\r\nfaith through Him\" (_Philadel._ 8).\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--T.

Bib._ iii. col. 3488.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIGNORAMUS (Latin for \"we do not know,\" \"we take no notice of\"), properly\r\nan English law term for the endorsement on the bill of indictment made\r\nby a grand jury when they \"throw out\" the bill, i.e. when they do not\r\nconsider that the case should go to a petty jury. The expression is now\r\nobsolete, \"not a true bill,\" \"no bill,\" being used. The expressions\r\n\"ignoramus jury,\" \"ignoramus Whig,\" &c., were common in the political\r\nsatires and pamphlets of the years following on the throwing out of the\r\nbill for high treason against the 2nd earl of Shaftesbury in 1681. The\r\napplication of the term to an ignorant person dates from the early part\r\nof the 17th century. The _New English Dictionary_ quotes two examples\r\nillustrating the early connexion of the term with the law or lawyers.\r\nGeorge Ruggle (1575-1622) in 1615 wrote a Latin play with the title\r\nIgnoramus, the name being also that of the chief character in it,\r\nintended for one Francis Brakin, the recorder of Cambridge. It is a\r\nsatire against the ignorance and pettifogging of the common lawyers of\r\nthe day. It was answered by a prose tract (not printed till 1648) by one\r\nRobert Callis, serjeant-at-law. This bore the title of _The Case and\r\nArgument against Sir Ignoramus of Cambridge_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIGNORANCE (Lat. _ignorantia_, from _ignorare_, not to know), want of\r\nknowledge, a state of mind which in law has important consequences. A\r\nwell-known legal maxim runs: _ignorantia juris non excusat_ (\"ignorance\r\nof the law does not excuse\"). With this is sometimes coupled another\r\nmaxim: _ignorantia facti excusat_ (\"ignorance of the fact excuses\").\r\nThat every one who has capacity to understand the law is presumed to\r\nknow it is a very necessary principle, for otherwise the courts would be\r\ncontinually occupied in endeavouring to solve problems which by their\r\nvery impracticability would render the administration of justice next to\r\nimpossible. It would be necessary for the court to engage in endless\r\ninquiries as to the true inwardness of a man's mind, whether his state\r\nof ignorance existed at the time of the commission of the offence,\r\nwhether such a condition of mind was inevitable or brought about merely\r\nby indifference on his part. Therefore, in English, as in Roman law,\r\nignorance of the law is no ground for avoiding the consequences of an\r\nact. So far as regards criminal offences, the maxim as to _ignorantia\r\njuris_ admits of no exception, even in the case of a foreigner\r\ntemporarily in England, who is likely to be ignorant of English law. In\r\nRoman law the harshness of the rule was mitigated in the case of women,\r\nsoldiers and persons under the age of twenty-five, unless they had good\r\nlegal advice within reach (_Dig._ xxii. 6. 9). Ignorance of a matter of\r\nfact may in general be alleged in avoidance of the consequences of acts\r\nand agreements, but such ignorance cannot be pleaded where it is the\r\nduty of a person to know, or where, having the means of knowledge at his\r\ndisposal, he wilfully or negligently fails to avail himself of it (see\r\nCONTRACT).\r\n\r\nIn logic, ignorance is that state of mind which for want of evidence is\r\nequally unable to affirm or deny one thing or another. Doubt, on the\r\nother hand, can neither affirm nor deny because the evidence seems\r\nequally strong for both. For _Ignoratio Elenchi_ (ignorance of the\r\nrefutation) see FALLACY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIGNORANTINES (_Frères Ignorantins_), a name given to the Brethren of the\r\nChristian Schools (_Frères des Écoles Chrétiennes_), a religious\r\nfraternity founded at Reims in 1680, and formally organized in 1683, by\r\nthe priest Jean Baptiste de la Salle, for the purpose of affording a\r\nfree education, especially in religion, to the children of the poor. In\r\naddition to the three simple vows of chastity, poverty and obedience,\r\nthe brothers were required to give their services without any\r\nremuneration and to wear a special habit of coarse black material,\r\nconsisting of a cassock, a hooded cloak with hanging sleeves and a\r\nbroad-brimmed hat. The name Ignorantine was given from a clause in the\r\nrules of the order forbidding the admission of priests with a\r\ntheological education. Other popular names applied to the order are\r\n_Frères de Saint-Yon_, from the house at Rouen, which was their\r\nheadquarters from 1705 till 1770, _Frères à quatre bras_, from their\r\nhanging sleeves, and _Frères Fouetteurs_, from their former use of the\r\nwhip (_fouet_) in punishments. The order, approved by Pope Benedict\r\nXIII. in 1724, rapidly spread over France, and although dissolved by the\r\nNational Assembly's decree in February 1790, was recalled by Napoleon I.\r\nin 1804, and formally recognized by the French government in 1808. Since\r\nthen its members have penetrated into nearly every country of Europe,\r\nand into America, Asia and Africa. They number about 14,000 members and\r\nhave over 2000 schools, and are the strongest Roman Catholic male order.\r\nThough not officially connected with the Jesuits, their organization and\r\ndiscipline are very similar.\r\n\r\n  See J. B. Blain, _La Vie du vénérable J. B. de la Salle_ (Versailles,\r\n  1887).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIGUALADA, a town of north-eastern Spain, in the province of Barcelona, on\r\nthe left bank of the river Noya, a right-hand tributary of the Llobregat,\r\nand at the northern terminus of the Igualada-Martorell-Barcelona railway.\r\nPop. (1900) 10,442. Igualada is the central market of a rich agricultural\r\nand wine-producing district. It consists of an old town with narrow and\r\nirregular streets and the remains of a fortress and ramparts, and a new\r\ntown which possesses regular and spacious streets and many fine houses.\r\nThe local industries, chiefly developed since 1880, include the\r\nmanufacture of cotton, linen, wool, ribbons, cloth, chocolate, soap,\r\nbrandies, leather, cards and nails. The famous mountain and convent of\r\nMontserrat or Monserrat (q.v.) is 12 m. E.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIGUANA, systematically _Iguanidae_ (Spanish quivalent of Carib _iwana_),\r\na family of pleurodont lizards, comprising about 50 genera and 300\r\nspecies. With three exceptions, all the genera of this extensive family\r\nbelong to the New World, being specially characteristic of the\r\nNeotropical region, where they occur as far south as Patagonia, while\r\nextending northward into the warmer parts of the Nearctic regions as far\r\nas California and British Columbia. The exceptional genera are\r\n_Brachylophus_ in the Fiji Islands, _Hoplurus_ and _Chalarodon_ in\r\nMadagascar. The iguanas are characterized by the peculiar form of their\r\nteeth, these being round at the root and blade-like, with serrated edges\r\ntowards the tip, resembling in this respect the gigantic extinct reptile\r\n_Iguanodon_. The typical forms belonging to this family are\r\ndistinguished by the large dewlap or pouch situated beneath the head and\r\nneck, and by the crest, composed of slender elongated scales, which\r\nextends in gradually diminishing height from the nape of the neck to the\r\nextremity of the tail. The latter organ is very long, slender and\r\ncompressed. The tongue is generally short and not deeply divided at its\r\nextremity, nor is its base retracted into a sheath; it is always moist\r\nand covered with a glutinous secretion. The prevailing colour of the\r\niguanas is green; and, as the majority of them are arboreal in their\r\nhabits, such colouring is generally regarded as protective. Those on the\r\nother hand which reside on the ground have much duller, although as a\r\nrule equally protective hues. Some iguanas, however (e.g. _Anolis\r\ncarolinensis_), possess, to an extent only exceeded by the chameleon,\r\nthe power of changing their colours, their brilliant green becoming\r\ntransformed under the influence of fear or irritation, into more sombre\r\nhues and even into black. They differ greatly in size, from a few inches\r\nto several feet in length.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--Iguana.]\r\n\r\nOne of the largest and most widely distributed is the common iguana\r\n(_Iguana tuberculata_), which occurs in the tropical parts of Central\r\nand South America and the West Indies, with the closely allied _I.\r\nrhinolophus_. It attains a length of 6 ft., weighing then perhaps 30\r\nlb., and is of a greenish colour, occasionally mixed with brown, while\r\nthe tail is surrounded with alternate rings of those colours. Its food\r\nconsists of vegetable substances, mostly leaves, which it obtains from\r\nthe forest trees among whose branches it lives and in the hollows of\r\nwhich it deposits its eggs. These are of an oblong shape about 1½ in. in\r\nlength, and are said by travellers to be very pleasant eating,\r\nespecially when taken raw, and mixed with farina. They are timid,\r\ndefenceless animals, depending for safety on the comparative\r\ninaccessibility of their arboreal haunts, and their protective\r\ncolouring, which is rendered even more effective by their remaining\r\nstill on the approach of danger. But the favourite resorts of the iguana\r\nare trees which overhang the water, into which they let themselves fall\r\nwith a splash, whatever the height of the tree, and then swim away, or\r\nhide at the bottom for many minutes. Otherwise they exhibit few signs of\r\nanimal intelligence. \"The iguana,\" says H. W. Bates (_The Naturalist on\r\nthe Amazons_), \"is one of the stupidest animals I ever met. The one I\r\ncaught dropped helplessly from a tree just ahead of me; it turned round\r\nfor a moment to have an idiotic stare at the intruder and then set off\r\nrunning along the path. I ran after it and it then stopped as a timid\r\ndog would do, crouching down and permitting me to seize it by the neck\r\nand carry it off.\" Along with several other species, notably _Ctenosura\r\nacanthinura_, which is omnivorous, likewise called iguana, the common\r\niguana, is much sought after in tropical America; the natives esteem its\r\nflesh a delicacy, and capture it by slipping a noose round its neck as\r\nit sits in fancied security on the branch of a tree.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--Head of _Iguana rhinolophus_.]\r\n\r\nAlthough chiefly arboreal, many of the iguanas take readily to the\r\nwater; and there is at least one species, _Amblyrhynchus cristatus_,\r\nwhich leads for the most part an aquatic life. These marine lizards\r\noccur only in the Galapagos Islands, where they are never seen more than\r\n20 yds. inland, while they may often be observed in companies several\r\nhundreds of yards from the shore, swimming with great facility by means\r\nof their flattened tails. Their feet are all more or less webbed, but in\r\nswimming they are said to keep these organs motionless by their sides.\r\nTheir food consists of marine vegetation, to obtain which they dive\r\nbeneath the water, where they are able to remain, without coming to the\r\nsurface to breathe, for a very considerable time. Though they are thus\r\nthe most aquatic of lizards, Darwin, who studied their habits during his\r\nvisit to those islands, states that when frightened they will not enter\r\nthe water. Driven along a narrow ledge of rock to the edge of the sea,\r\nthey preferred capture to escape by swimming, while if thrown into the\r\nwater they immediately returned to the point from which they started. A\r\nland species belonging to the allied genus _Conolophus_ also occurs in\r\nthe Galapagos, which differs from most of its kind in forming burrows in\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIGUANODON, a large extinct herbivorous land reptile from the Wealden\r\nformation of western Europe, almost completely known by numerous\r\nskeletons from Bernissart, near Mons, Belgium. It is a typical\r\nrepresentative of the ornithopodous (Gr. for bird-footed) Dinosauria.\r\nThe head is large and laterally compressed with a blunt snout, nearly\r\nterminal nostrils and relatively small eyes. The sides of the jaws are\r\nprovided with a close series of grinding teeth, which are often worn\r\ndown to stumps; the front of the jaws forms a toothless beak, which\r\nwould be encased originally in a horny sheath. When unworn the teeth are\r\nspatulate and crimped or serrated round the edge, closely resembling\r\nthose of the existing Central American lizard, _Iguana_--hence the name\r\n_Iguanodon_ (Gr. Iguana-tooth) proposed by Mantell, the discoverer of\r\nthis reptile, in 1825. The bodies of the vertebrae are solid; and they\r\nare convexo-concave (i.e. _opisthocoelous_) in the neck and anterior\r\npart of the back, where there must have been much freedom of motion. The\r\nhindquarters are comparatively large and heavy, while the tail is long,\r\ndeep and more or less laterally compressed, evidently adapted for\r\nswimming. The small and mobile fore-limbs bear four complete fingers,\r\nwith the thumb reduced to a bony spur. The pelvis and hind-limbs much\r\nresemble those of a running bird, such as those of an emu or the extinct\r\nmoa; but the basal bones (metatarsals) of the three-toed foot remain\r\nseparate throughout life, thus differing from those of the running\r\nbirds, which are firmly fused together even in the young adult. No\r\nexternal armour has been found. The reptile doubtless frequented\r\nmarshes, feeding on the succulent vegetation, and often swimming in the\r\nwater. Footprints prove that when on land it walked habitually on its\r\nhind-limbs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Skeleton of _Iguanadon bernissartensis_. (After Dollo.)]\r\n\r\nThe earliest remains of _Iguanodon_ were found by Dr G. A. Mantell in\r\nthe Wealden formation of Sussex, and a large part of the skeleton,\r\nlacking the head, was subsequently discovered in a block of ragstone in\r\nthe Lower Greensand near Maidstone, Kent. These fossils, which are now\r\nin the British Museum, were interpreted by Dr Mantell, who made\r\ncomparisons with the skeleton of _Iguana_, on the erroneous supposition\r\nthat the resemblance in the teeth denoted some relationship to this\r\nexisting lizard. Several of the bones, however, could not be understood\r\nuntil the much later discoveries of Mr S. H. Beckles in the Wealden\r\ncliffs near Hastings; and an accurate knowledge of the skeleton was only\r\nobtained when many complete specimens were disinterred by the Belgian\r\ngovernment from the Wealden beds at Bernissart, near Mons, during the\r\nyears 1877-1880. These skeletons, which now form the most striking\r\nfeature of the Brussels Museum, evidently represent a large troop of\r\nanimals which were suddenly destroyed and buried in a deep ravine or\r\ngully. The typical species, _Iguanodon mantelli_, measures 5 to 6 metres\r\nin length, while _I. bernissartensis_ (see fig.) attains a length of 8\r\nto 10 metres. They are found both at Bernissart and in the south of\r\nEngland, while other species are also known from Sussex. Nearly complete\r\nskeletons of allied reptiles have been discovered in the Jurassic and\r\nCretaceous rocks of North America.\r\n\r\n  REFERENCES.--G. A.

Wo.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIGUVIUM (mod. Gubbio, q.v.), a town of Umbria, situated among the\r\nmountains, about 23 m. N.N.E. of Perusia and connected with it by a\r\nby-road, which joined the Via Flaminia near the temple of Jupiter\r\nAppenninus, at the modern Scheggia. It appears to have been an important\r\nplace in pre-Roman times, both from its coins and from the celebrated\r\n_tabulae Iguvinae_ (see below).\r\n\r\nWe find it in possession of a treaty with Rome, similar to that of the\r\nCamertes Umbri; and in 167 B.C. it was used as a place of safe custody\r\nfor the Illyrian King Gentius and his sons (Livy xlv. 43). After the\r\nSocial War, in which it took no part, it received Roman citizenship. At\r\nthat epoch it must have received full citizen rights since it was\r\nincluded in the tribus Clustumina (_C.I.L._ xi. e.g. 5838). In 49 B.C.\r\nit was occupied by Minucius Thermus on behalf of Pompey, but he\r\nabandoned the town. Under the empire we hear almost nothing of it.\r\nSilius Italicus mentions it as subject to fogs. A bishop of Iguvium is\r\nmentioned as early as A.D. 413. It was taken and destroyed by the Goths\r\nin 552, but rebuilt with the help of Narses. The Umbrian town had three\r\ngates only, and probably lay on the steep mountain side as the present\r\ntown does, while the Roman city lay in the lower ground. Here is the\r\ntheatre, which, as an inscription records, was restored by Cn. Satrius\r\nRufus in the time of Augustus. The diameter of the orchestra is 76½ ft.\r\nand of the whole 230 ft., so that it is a building of considerable size;\r\nthe stage is well preserved and so are parts of the external arcades of\r\nthe auditorium. Not far off are ruins probably of ancient baths, and the\r\nconcrete core of a large tomb with a vaulted chamber within.     (T. As.)\r\n\r\nOf Latin inscriptions (_C.I.L._ xi. 5803-5926) found at Iguvium two or\r\nthree are of Augustan date, but none seem to be earlier. A Latin\r\ninscription of Iguvium (_C.I.L._ xi. 5824) mentions a priest whose\r\nfunctions are characteristic of the place \"L. Veturius Rufio avispex\r\nextispecus, sacerdos publicus et privatus.\"\r\n\r\nThe ancient town is chiefly celebrated for the famous _Iguvine_ (less\r\ncorrectly _Eugubine_) _Tables_, which were discovered there in 1444,\r\nbought by the municipality in 1456, and are still preserved in the town\r\nhall. A Dominican, Leandro Alberti (_Descrizione d'Italia_, 1550),\r\nstates that they were originally nine in number, and an independent\r\nauthority, Antonio Concioli (_Statuta civitatis Eugubii_, 1673), states\r\nthat two of the nine were taken to Venice in 1540 and never reappeared.\r\nThe existing seven were first published in a careful but largely\r\nmistaken transcript by Buonarotti in 1724, as an appendix to Dempster's\r\n_De Etruria Regali_.[1]\r\n\r\nThe first real advance towards their interpretation was made by Otfried\r\nMüller (_Die Etrusker_, 1828), who pointed out that though their\r\nalphabet was akin to the Etruscan their language was Italic. Lepsius, in\r\nhis essay _De tabulis Eugubinis_ (1833), finally determined the value of\r\nthe Umbrian signs and the received order of the Tables, pointing out\r\nthat those in Latin alphabet were the latest. He subsequently published\r\nwhat may be called the _editio princeps_ in 1841. The first edition,\r\nwith a full commentary based on scientific principles, was that of\r\nAufrecht and Kirchhoff in 1849-1851, and on this all subsequent\r\ninterpretations are based (Bréal, Paris, 1875; Bücheler, _Umbrica_,\r\nBonn, 1883, a reprint and enlargement of articles in Fleckeisen's\r\n_Jahrbuch_, 1875, pp. 127 and 313). The text is everywhere perfectly\r\nlegible, and is excellently represented in photographs by the marquis\r\nRanghiasci-Brancaleone, published with Bréal's edition.\r\n\r\n  _Language._--The dialect in which this ancient set of liturgies is\r\n  written is usually known as Umbrian, as it is the only monument we\r\n  possess of any length of the tongue spoken in the Umbrian district\r\n  before it was latinized (see UMBRIA). The name, however, is certainly\r\n  too wide, since an inscription from Tuder of, probably, the 3rd\r\n  century B.C. (R. S. Conway, _The Italic Dialects_, 352) shows a final\r\n  -_s_ and a medial -_d_-, both apparently preserved from the changes\r\n  which befell these sounds, as we shall see, in the dialect of Iguvium.\r\n  On the other hand, inscriptions of Fulginia and Assisium (ibid.\r\n  354-355) agree very well, so far as they go, with Iguvine. It is\r\n  especially necessary to make clear that the language known as Umbrian\r\n  is that of a certain limited area, which cannot yet be shown to have\r\n  extended very far beyond the eastern half of the Tiber valley (from\r\n  Interamna Nahartium to Urvinum Mataurense), because the term is often\r\n  used by archaeologists with a far wider connotation to include all the\r\n  Italic, pre-Etruscan inhabitants of upper Italy; Professor Ridgeway,\r\n  for instance, in his _Early Age of Greece_, frequently speaks of the\r\n  \"Umbrians\" as the race to which belonged the Villanova culture of the\r\n  Early Iron age. It is now one of the most urgent problems in the\r\n  history of Italy to determine the actual historical relation (see\r\n  further ROME: _History, ad. init._) between the [Greek: 'Ombroi] of,\r\n  say, Herodotus and the language of Iguvium, of which we may now offer\r\n  some description, using the term Umbrian strictly in this sense.\r\n\r\n  Under the headings LATIN LANGUAGE and OSCA LINGUA there have been\r\n  collected (1) the points which separate all the Italic languages from\r\n  their nearest congeners, and (2) those which separate Osco-Umbrian\r\n  from Latin. We have now to notice (3) the points in which Umbrian has\r\n  diverged from Oscan. The first of them antedates by six or seven\r\n  centuries the similar change in the Romance languages (see ROMANCE\r\n  LANGUAGES).\r\n\r\n  (1) The palatalization of _k_ and _g_ before a following _i_ or _e_,\r\n  or consonant _i_ as in _tiçit_ (i.e. _diçit_) = Lat. _decet_; _muieto_\r\n  past part. passive (pronounced as though the _i_ were an English or\r\n  French _j_) beside Umb. imperative _mugatu_, Lat. _mugire_.\r\n\r\n  (2) The loss of final -_d_, e.g. in the abl. sing. fem. Umb. _tota_ =\r\n  Osc. _toutad_.\r\n\r\n  (3) The change of _d_ between vowels to a sound akin to _r_, written\r\n  by a special symbol q (_d_) in Umbrian alphabet and by RS in Latin\r\n  alphabet, e.g. _teda_ in Umbrian alphabet = _dirsa_ in Latin alphabet\r\n  (see below), \"let him give,\" exactly equivalent to Paelignian _dida_\r\n  (see PAELIGNI).\r\n\r\n  (4) The change of -_s_- to -_r_- between vowels as in _erom_, \"esse\" =\r\n  Osc. _ezum_, and the gen. plur. fem. ending in -_aru_ = Lat. -_arum_,\r\n  Osc. -_azum_.\r\n\r\n  To this there appear a long string of exceptions, e.g. _asa_ = Lat.\r\n  _ara_. These are generally regarded as mere archaisms, and\r\n  unfortunately the majority of them are in words of whose origin and\r\n  meaning very little is known, so that (for all we can tell) in many\r\n  the -_s_- may represent -_ss_- or -_ps_- as in _osatu_ = Lat.\r\n  _operato_, cf. Osc. _opsaom_.\r\n\r\n  (5) The change of final -_ns_ to -_f_ as in the acc. plur. masc.\r\n  _vitluf_ = Lat. _vitulos_.\r\n\r\n  (6) In the latest stage of the dialect (see below) the change of final\r\n  -_s_ to -_r_, as in abl. plur. _arver_, _arviis_, i.e. \"arvorum\r\n  frugibus.\"\r\n\r\n  (7) The decay of all diphthongs; _ai_, _oi_, _ei_ all become a\r\n  monophthong variously written _e_ and _i_ (rarely _ei_), as in the\r\n  dat. sing. fem. _tote_, \"civitati\"; dat. sing. masc. _pople_,\r\n  \"populo\"; loc. sing. masc. _onse_ (from *_om(e)sei_), \"in umero.\" So\r\n  _au_, _eu_, _ou_ all become _o_, as in _ote_ = Osc. _auti_, Lat.\r\n  _aut_.\r\n\r\n  (8) The change of initial _l_ to _v_, as in _vutu_ = Lat. _lavito_.\r\n\r\n  Owing to the peculiar character of the Tables no grammatical statement\r\n  about Umbrian is free from difficulty; and these bare outlines of its\r\n  phonology must be supplemented by reference to the lucid discussion in\r\n  C. D. Buck's _Oscan and Umbrian Grammar_ (Boston, 1904), or to the\r\n  earlier and admirably complete _Oskischumbrische Grammatik_ of R. von\r\n  Planta (Strassburg, 1892-1897). Some of the most important questions\r\n  are discussed by R. S. Conway in _The Italic Dialects_, vol. ii. p.\r\n  495 seq.\r\n\r\n  Save for the consequences of these phonetic changes, Umbrian\r\n  morphology and syntax exhibit no divergence from Oscan that need be\r\n  mentioned here, save perhaps two peculiar perfect-formations with\r\n  -_l_- and -_nçi_-; as in _ampelust_, fut. perf. \"impenderit,\"\r\n  _combifiançiust_, \"nuntiaverit\" (or the like). Full accounts of the\r\n  accidence and syntax, so far as it is represented in the inscriptions,\r\n  will be found in the grammars of Buck and von Planta already\r\n  mentioned, and in the second volume of Conway, _op. cit._\r\n\r\n  _Chronology._ (I.) _The Relative Dates of the Tables._--At least four\r\n  periods in the history of the dialect can be distinguished in the\r\n  records we have left to us, by the help of the successive changes (a)\r\n  in alphabet and (b) in language, which the Tables exhibit. Of these\r\n  only the outstanding features can be mentioned here; for a fuller\r\n  discussion the reader must be referred to _The Italic Dialects_, pp.\r\n  400 sqq.\r\n\r\n  (a) _Changes in Alphabet._--Observe first that Tables I., II., III.\r\n  and IV., and the first two inscriptions of V. are in Umbrian\r\n  character; the Latin alphabet is used in the _Claverniur_ paragraph\r\n  (V. iii.), and the whole of VI. (_a_ and _b_) and VII. (_a_ and _b_).\r\n\r\n  What we may call the normal Umbrian alphabet (in which e.g. Table I.\r\n  _a_ is written) consists of the following signs, the writing being\r\n  always from right to left: [Symbols: A a, B b, D d] (i.e. a sound akin\r\n  to _r_ derived from _d_), [Symbols: E e, F v, Z z, H h, I i, K k] and\r\n  g, [Symbols: L l, M m, N n, P p, R r, S s X t] and d, V u and o,\r\n  [Symbols: F f, S s] (i.e. a voiceless palatal consonant.)\r\n\r\n  In the Latin alphabet, in which Tables VI. and VII. and the third\r\n  inscription of Table V. are written, _d_ is represented by RS, _g_ by\r\n  G, but _k_ by C, _d_ by D, _t_ by T, _v_ and _u_ by V but _o_ by O, s\r\n  by S, though the diacritic is often omitted. The interpunct is double\r\n  with the Umbrian alphabet, single and medial with the Latin.\r\n\r\n  Tables VI. and VII., then, and V. iii., were written later than the\r\n  rest. But even in the earlier group certain variations appear.\r\n\r\n  The latest form of the Umbrian alphabet is that of Table V. i. and\r\n  ii., where the abbreviated form of _m_ (^) and the angular and\r\n  undivided form of _k_ ([Symbols: k not K] are especially\r\n  characteristic.\r\n\r\n  Nearest to this is that of Tables III. and IV., which form a single\r\n  document; then that of I. (a) and (b); earliest would seem that of II.\r\n  (a) and II. (b). In II. _a_, 18 and 24, we have the archaic letter\r\n  _san_ (M = _s_) of the abecedaria (E. S. Roberts, _Int. Gr. Epig._ pp.\r\n  17 ff.), which appears in no other Italic nor in any Chalcidian\r\n  inscription, though it survived longer in Etruscan and Venetic use.\r\n  Against this may be set the use of [Symbol: O] for _t_ in I. _b_ 1,\r\n  but this appears also in IV. 20 and should be called rather Etruscan\r\n  than archaic. These characteristics of II. _a_ and _b_ would be in\r\n  themselves too slight to prove an earlier date, but they have perhaps\r\n  some weight as confirming the evidence of the language.\r\n\r\n  (b) _Changes in Language._--The evidence of date derived from changes\r\n  in the language is more difficult to formulate, and the inquiry calls\r\n  for the most diligent use of scientific method and critical judgment.\r\n  Its intricacy lies in the character of the documents before\r\n  us--religious formularies consisting partly of matter established in\r\n  usage long before they were written down in their present shape,\r\n  partly of additions made at the time of writing. The best example of\r\n  this is furnished by the expansion and modernisation of the\r\n  subject-matter of Table I. into Tables VI. and VII._a_. Hence we\r\n  frequently meet with forms which had passed out of the language that\r\n  was spoken at the time they were engraved, side by side with their\r\n  equivalents in that language. We may distinguish four periods, as\r\n  follows:\r\n\r\n  1. The first period is represented, not by any complete table, but by\r\n  the old unmodernised forms of Tables III. and IV., which show the\r\n  original guttural plosives unpalatalized, e.g. _kebu_ = Lat. _cibum_.\r\n\r\n  2. In the second period the gutturals have been palatalized, but there\r\n  yet is no change of final _s_ to _r_. This is represented by the rest\r\n  of III. and IV. and by II. (_a_ and _b_).\r\n\r\n  3. In the third period final _s_ has everywhere become _r_. This\r\n  appears in V. (i. and ii. and also iii.). Table I. is a copy or\r\n  redraft made from older documents during this period. This is shown by\r\n  the occasional appearance of _r_ instead of final _s_.\r\n\r\n  4. Soon after the dialect had reached its latest form, the Latin\r\n  alphabet was adopted. Tables VI. and VII._a_ contain an expanded form\r\n  of the same liturgical direction as Table I.\r\n\r\n  It is probable that further research will amend this classification in\r\n  detail, but its main lines are generally accepted.\r\n\r\n  (II.) _Actual Date of the Tables._--Only the leading points can be\r\n  mentioned here.\r\n\r\n  (i.) The Latin alphabet of the latest Tables resembles that of the\r\n  _Tabula Bantina_, and might have been engraved at almost any time\r\n  between 150 B.C. and 50 B.C. It is quite likely that the closer\r\n  relations with Rome, which began after the Social War, led to the\r\n  adoption of the Latin alphabet. Hence we should infer that the Tables\r\n  in Umbrian alphabet were at all events older than 90 B.C.\r\n\r\n  (ii.) For an upper limit of date, in default of definite evidence, it\r\n  seems imprudent to go back beyond the 5th century B.C., since neither\r\n  in Rome nor Campania have we any evidence of public written documents\r\n  of any earlier century. When more is known of the earliest Etruscan\r\n  inscriptions it may become possible to date the Iguvine Tables by\r\n  their alphabetic peculiarities as compared with their mother-alphabet,\r\n  the Etruscan. The \"Tuscan name\" is denounced in the comprehensive\r\n  curse of Table VI. b, 53-60, and we may infer that the town of Iguvium\r\n  was independent but in fear of the Etruscans at the time when the\r\n  curse was first composed. The absence of all mention of either Gauls\r\n  or Romans seems to prove that this time was at least earlier than 400\r\n  B.C.; and the curse may have been composed long before it was written\r\n  down.\r\n\r\n  The chief sources in which further information may be sought have been\r\n  already mentioned.

Press, 1897).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIJOLITE (derived from the first syllable of the Finnish words _Jiwaru_,\r\n_Jijoki_, &c., common as geographical names in the Kola peninsula, and\r\nthe Gr. [Greek: lithos], a stone), a rock consisting essentially of\r\nnepheline and augite, and of great rarity, but of considerable\r\nimportance from a mineralogical and petrographical standpoint. It occurs\r\nin various parts of the Kola peninsula in north Finland on the shores of\r\nthe White Sea. The pyroxene is morphic, yellow or green, and is\r\nsurrounded by formless areas of nepheline. The accessory minerals are\r\napatite, cancrinite, calcite, titanite and jiwaarite, a dark-brown\r\ntitaniferous variety of melanite-garnet. This rock is the plutonic and\r\nholocrystalline analogue of the nephelenites and nepheline-dolerites;\r\nit bears the same relation to them as the nepheline-syenites have to the\r\nphonolites. It is worth mentioning that a leucite-augite rock,\r\nresembling ijolite except in containing leucite in place of nepheline,\r\nis known to occur at Shonkin Creek, near Fort Benton, Montana, and has\r\nbeen called missourite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIKI, an island belonging to Japan, lying off the north-western coast of\r\nKiushiu, in 33° 45´ N. lat. and 129° 40´ E. long. It has a circumference\r\nof 86 m., an area of 51 sq. m., and a population of 36,530. The island\r\nis, for the most part, a tableland about 500 ft. above sea-level. The\r\nanchorage is at Gonoura, on the south-west. A part of Kublai Khan's\r\nMongols landed at Iki when about to invade Japan in the 13th century,\r\nfor it lies in the direct route from Korea to Japan via Tsushima. In the\r\nimmediate vicinity are several rocky islets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nILAGAN, the capital of the province of Isabela, Luzon, Philippine\r\nIslands, on an elevated site at the confluence of the Pinacanauan river\r\nwith the Grande de Cagayan, about 200 m. N.N.E. of Manila. Pop. (1903)\r\n16,008. The neighbouring country is the largest tobacco-producing\r\nsection in the Philippines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nILCHESTER, a market town in the southern parliamentary division of\r\nSomersetshire, England, in the valley of the river Ivel or Yeo, 5 m.\r\nN.W. of Yeovil. It is connected by a stone bridge with the village of\r\nNorthover on the other side of the river. Ilchester has lost the\r\nimportance it once possessed, and had in 1901 a population of only 564,\r\nbut its historical interest is considerable. The parish church of St\r\nMary is Early English and Perpendicular, with a small octagonal tower,\r\nbut has been largely restored in modern times. The town possesses\r\nalmshouses founded in 1426, a picturesque cross, and a curious ancient\r\nmace of the former corporation.\r\n\r\nIlchester (_Cair Pensavelcoit_, _Ischalis_, _Ivelcestre_,\r\n_Yevelchester_) was a fortified British settlement, and subsequently a\r\nmilitary station of the Romans, whose Fosse Way passed through it. Its\r\nimportance continued in Saxon times, and in 1086 it was a royal borough\r\nwith 107 burgesses. In 1180 a gild merchant was established, and the\r\ncounty gaol was completed in 1188. Henry II. granted a charter,\r\nconfirmed by John in 1203, which gave Ilchester the same liberties as\r\nWinchester, with freedom from tolls and from being impleaded without the\r\nwalls, the fee farm being fixed at £26, 10s. 0d. The bailiffs of\r\nIlchester are mentioned before 1230. The borough was incorporated in\r\n1556, the fee farm being reduced to £8. Ilchester was the centre of the\r\ncounty administration from the reign of Edward III. until the 19th\r\ncentury, when the change from road to rail travelling completed the\r\ndecay of the town. Its place has been taken by Taunton. The corporation\r\nwas abolished in 1886. Parliamentary representation began in 1298, and\r\nthe town continued to return two members until 1832. A fair on the 29th\r\nof August was granted by the charter of 1203. Other fairs on the 27th of\r\nDecember, the 21st of July, and the Monday before Palm Sunday, were held\r\nunder a charter of 1289. The latter, fixed as the 25th of March, was\r\nstill held at the end of the 18th century, but there is now no fair. The\r\nWednesday market dates from before the Conquest. The manufacture of\r\nthread lace was replaced by silk weaving about 1750, but this has\r\ndecayed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nÎLE-DE-FRANCE, an old district of France, forming a kind of island,\r\nbounded by the Seine, the Marne, the Beuvronne, the Thève and the Oise.\r\nIn this sense the name is not found in written documents before 1429;\r\nbut in the second half of the 15th century it designated a wide military\r\nprovince of government, bounded N. by Picardy, W. by Normandy, S. by\r\nOrléanais and Nivernais, and E. by Champagne. Its capital was Paris.\r\nFrom the territory of Île-de-France were formed under the Revolution the\r\ndepartment of the Seine, together with the greater part of\r\nSeine-et-Oise, Seine-et-Marne, Oise and Aisne, and a small part of\r\nLoiret and Nièvre. (The term Île-de-France is also used for Mauritius,\r\nq.v.).\r\n\r\n  See A. Longnon, \"L'Île-de-France, son origine, ses limites, ses\r\n  gouverneurs,\" in the _Mémoires de la Société de l'histoire de Paris et\r\n  de l'Île-de-France_, vol. i. (1875).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nILETSK, formerly _Fort Iletskaya Zashchita_, a town of Russia, in the\r\ngovernment of Orenburg, 48 m. S. of the town of Orenburg by the railway\r\nto Tashkent, near the Ilek river, a tributary of the Ural. Pop. 11,802\r\nin 1897. A thick bed of excellent rock-salt is worked here to the extent\r\nof about 100,000 tons annually. The place is resorted to for its salt,\r\nmud and brine baths, and its koumiss cures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nILFELD, a town in Germany, in the Prussian province of Hanover, situated\r\nat the south foot of the Harz, at the entrance to the Bährethal, 8 m. N.\r\nfrom Nordhausen by the railway to Wernigerode. Pop. 1600. It contains an\r\nEvangelical church, a celebrated gymnasium, once a monasterial school,\r\nwith a fine library, and manufactures of parquet-flooring, paper and\r\nplaster of Paris, while another industry in the town is brewing. It is\r\nalso of some repute as a health resort.\r\n\r\nIlfeld, as a town, dates from the 14th century, when it sprang up round\r\na Benedictine monastery. Founded about 1190 this latter was reformed in\r\n1545, and a year later converted into the school mentioned above, which\r\nunder the rectorship of Michael Neander (1525-1595) enjoyed a reputation\r\nfor scholarship which it has maintained until to-day.\r\n\r\n  See Förstemann, _Monumenta rerum Ilfeldensium_ (Nordhausen, 1843); M.\r\n  Neander, _Bericht vom Kloster Ilfeld_, edited by Bouterwek (Göttingen,\r\n  1873); and K. Meyer, _Geschichte des Klosters Ilfeld_ (Leipzig, 1897).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nILFORD [GREAT ILFORD], an urban district in the Romford parliamentary\r\ndivision of Essex, England, on the Roding, 7 m. E.N.E. of London by the\r\nGreat Eastern railway. Pop. (1891) 10,913, (1901) 41,234. A portion of\r\nHainault Forest lies within the parish. The hospital of St Mary and St\r\nThomas, founded in the 12th century as a leper hospital, now contains\r\nalmshouses and a chapel, and belongs to the marquess of Salisbury, who\r\nas \"Master\" is required to maintain a chaplain and six aged inmates. The\r\nchapel appears to be of the date of this foundation. Claybury Hall is a\r\nlunatic asylum (1893) of the London County Council. There are large\r\nphotographic material works and paper mills. LITTLE ILFORD is a parish\r\non the opposite (west) side of the Roding. The church of St Mary retains\r\nNorman portions, and has a curious monumental brass commemorating a boy\r\nin school-going clothes (1517). Pop. (1901) 17,915.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nILFRACOMBE, a seaport and watering-place in the Barnstaple parliamentary\r\ndivision of Devonshire, England, on the Bristol Channel, 225 m. W. by S.\r\nof London by the London & South-Western railway. Pop. of urban district\r\n(1901) 8557. The picturesque old town, built on the cliffs above its\r\nharbour, consists of one street stretching for about a mile through a\r\nnetwork of lanes. Behind it rise the terraces of a more modern town,\r\ncommanding a fine view across the Channel. With its beautiful scenery\r\nand temperate climate, Ilfracombe is frequented by visitors both in\r\nsummer and winter. Grand rugged cliffs line the coast; while, inland,\r\nthe country is celebrated for the rich colouring of its woods and glens.\r\nWooded heights form a semicircle round the town, which is protected from\r\nsea winds by Capstone Hill. Along the inner face of this rock has been\r\ncut the Victoria Promenade, a long walk roofed with glass and used for\r\nconcerts. The restored church of Holy Trinity dates originally from the\r\n12th century. Sea-bathing is insecure, and is confined to a few small\r\ncoves, approached by tunnels hewn through the rock. The harbour, a\r\nnatural recess among the cliffs, is sheltered on the east by Hilsborough\r\nHead, where there are some alleged Celtic remains; on the west by\r\nLantern Hill, where the ancient chapel of St Nicholas has been\r\ntransformed into a lighthouse. In summer, passenger steamers run to and\r\nfrom Ilfracombe pier; but the shipping trade generally has declined,\r\nthough herring fisheries are carried on with success. In the latter part\r\nof the 13th century Ilfracombe obtained a grant for holding a fair and\r\nmarket, and in the reign of Edward III. it was a place of such\r\nimportance as to supply him with six ships and ninety-six men for his\r\narmament against Calais. During the Civil War, being garrisoned for the\r\nRoundheads, it was in 1644 captured by the Royalists, but in 1646 it\r\nfell into the hands of Fairfax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nILHAVO, a seaport in the district of Aveiro, formerly included in the\r\nprovince of Beira, Portugal, 3 m. S.W. of Aveiro (q.v.), on the lagoon\r\nof Aveiro, an inlet of the Atlantic Ocean. Pop. (1900) 12,617. Ilhavo is\r\ninhabited chiefly by fishermen, but has a celebrated manufactory of\r\nglass and porcelain, the Vista-Alegre, at which the art of glass-cutting\r\nhas reached a high degree of perfection. Salt is largely exported.\r\nIlhavo is celebrated for the beauty of its women. It is said to have\r\nbeen founded by Greek colonists about 400 B.C., but this tradition is of\r\ndoubtful validity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nILI, one of the principal rivers of Central Asia, in the Russian\r\nprovince of Semiryechensk. The head-stream, called the Tekez, rises at\r\nan altitude of 11,600 ft. E. of Lake Issyk-kul, in 82° 25´ E. and 43°\r\n23´ N., on the W. slopes of mount Kash-katur. At first it flows eastward\r\nand north-eastward, until, after emerging from the mountains, it meets\r\nthe Kungez, and then, assuming the name of Ili, it turns westwards and\r\nflows between the Trans-Ili Ala-tau mountains on the south and the\r\nBoro-khoro and Talki ranges on the north for about 300 m. to Iliysk. The\r\nvalley between 79° 30´ and 82° E. is 50 m. wide, and the portion above\r\nthe town of Kulja (Old Kulja) is fertile and populous, Taranchi villages\r\nfollowing each other in rapid succession, and the pastures being well\r\nstocked with sheep and cattle and horses. At Iliysk the river turns\r\nnorth-west, and after traversing a region of desert and marsh falls by\r\nat least seven mouths into the Balkash Lake, the first bifurcation of\r\nthe delta taking place about 115 m. up the river. But it is only the\r\nsouthern arm of the delta that permanently carries water. The total\r\nlength of the river is over 900 m. From Old Kulja to New Kulja the Ili\r\nis navigable for at most only two and a half months in the year, and\r\neven then considerable difficulty is occasioned by the shoals and\r\nsandbanks. From New Kulja to Iliysk (280 m.) navigation is easy when the\r\nwater is high, and practicable even at its lowest for small boats. At\r\nIliysk there is a ferry on the road from Kopal to Vyernyi. The principal\r\ntributaries of the Ili are the Kash, Chilik and Charyn. A vast number of\r\nstreams flow towards it from the mountains on both sides, but most of\r\nthem are used up by the irrigation canals and never reach their goal.\r\nThe wealth of coal in the valley is said to be great, and when the\r\nChinese owned the country they worked gold and silver with profit. Fort\r\nIli or Iliysk, a modern Russian establishment, must not be confounded\r\nwith Ili, the old capital of the Chinese province of the same name. The\r\nlatter, otherwise known as Hoi-yuan-chen, New Kulja (Gulja), or Manchu\r\nKulja, was formerly a city of 70,000 inhabitants, but now lies\r\ncompletely deserted. Old Kulja, Tatar Kulja or Nin-yuan, is now the\r\nprincipal town of the district. The Chinese district of Ili formerly\r\nincluded the whole of the valley of the Ili river as far as Issyk-kul,\r\nbut now only its upper part. Its present area is about 27,000 sq. m. and\r\nits population probably 70,000. It belongs administratively to the\r\nprovince of Sin-kiang or East Turkestan. (See KULJA.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nILION, a village of Herkimer county, New York, U.S.A., about 12 m. S.E.\r\nof Utica, on the S. bank of the Mohawk river. Pop. (1890) 4057; (1900)\r\n5138 (755 foreign-born); (1905, state census) 5924; (1910) 6588. It is\r\nserved by the New York Central & Hudson river, and the West Shore\r\nrailways, by the Utica & Mohawk Valley Electric railroad, and by the\r\nErie canal. It has a public library (1868) of about 13,500 volumes, a\r\npublic hospital and a village hall. The village owns its water-works and\r\nits electric-lighting plant. Its principal manufactures are Remington\r\ntypewriters and Remington fire-arms (notably the Remington rifle); other\r\nmanufactures are filing cabinets and cases and library and office\r\nfurniture (the Clark & Baker Co.), knit goods, carriages and harness,\r\nand store fixtures. In 1828 Eliphalet Remington (1793-1861) established\r\nhere a small factory for the manufacture of rifles. He invented, and,\r\nwith the assistance of his sons, Philo (1816-1889), Samuel and\r\nEliphalet, improved the famous Remington rifle, which was adopted by\r\nseveral European governments, and was supplied in large numbers to the\r\nUnited States army. In 1856 the company added the manufacture of farming\r\ntools, in 1870 sewing-machines, and in 1874 typewriters. The last-named\r\nindustry was sold to the Wyckoff, Seamans & Benedict Company in 1886,\r\nand soon afterwards, on the failure of the original Remington company,\r\nthe fire-arms factory was bought by a New York City firm. A store was\r\nestablished on the present site of Ilion as early as 1816, but the\r\nvillage really dates from the completion of the Erie canal in 1825. On\r\nthe canal list it was called Steele's Creek, but it was also known as\r\nMorgan's Landing, and from 1830 to 1843 as Remington's Corners. The\r\npost-office, which was established in 1845, was named Remington, in\r\nhonour of Eliphalet Remington; but later the present name was adopted.\r\nThe village was incorporated in 1852. Ilion is a part of the township of\r\nGerman Flats (pop. in 1900, 8663; in 1910, 10,160), settled by\r\nPalatinate Germans about 1725. The township was the scene of several\r\nIndian raids during the French and Indian War and the War of\r\nIndependence. Here General Herkimer began his advance to raise the siege\r\nof Fort Schuyler (1777), and subsequently Ilion was the rendezvous of\r\nBenedict Arnold's force during the same campaign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nILKESTON, a market town and municipal borough, in the Ilkeston\r\nparliamentary division of Derbyshire, England, 9 m. E.N.E. of Derby, on\r\nthe Midland and the Great Northern railways. Pop. (1891) 19,744, (1901)\r\n25,384. It is situated on a hill commanding fine views of the Erewash\r\nvalley. The church of St Mary is Norman and Early English, and has a\r\nfine chancel screen dating from the later part of the 13th century. The\r\nmanufactures of the town are principally hosiery and lace, and various\r\nkinds of stoneware. Coal and iron are wrought in the neighbourhood. An\r\nalkaline mineral spring, resembling the seltzer water of Germany, was\r\ndiscovered in 1830, and baths were then erected, which, however, were\r\nsubsequently closed. The town, which is very ancient, being mentioned in\r\nDomesday, obtained a grant for a market and fair in 1251, and received\r\nits charter of incorporation in 1887. It is governed by a mayor, 6\r\naldermen and 18 councillors. Area, 2526 acres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nILKLEY, an urban district in the Otley parliamentary division of the\r\nWest Riding of Yorkshire, England, 16 m. N.W. from Leeds, on the Midland\r\nand the North-Eastern railways. Pop. of urban district (1901) 7455. It\r\nis beautifully situated in the upper part of the valley of the Wharfe,\r\nand owing to the fine scenery of the neighbourhood, and to the bracing\r\nair of the high moorlands above the valley, has become a favourite\r\nhealth resort. Here and at Ben Rhydding, 1 m. E., are several\r\nhydropathic establishments. The church of All Saints is in the main\r\nDecorated, largely restored in 1860. Three ancient sculptured crosses\r\nare preserved in the churchyard. The institutions include a museum of\r\nlocal antiquities, a grammar school, the Siemens Convalescent Home and\r\nthe Ilkley Bath Charitable Institution. The fine remains of Bolton Abbey\r\nlie in the Wharfe valley, 5 m. above Ilkley. Ilkley has been identified\r\nwith the _Olicana_ of Ptolemy, one of the towns of the British tribe of\r\nthe Brigantes. There was a Roman fort near the present church of All\r\nSaints, and the site has yielded inscriptions and other small remains.\r\nNumerous relics are preserved in the museum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nILL, a river of Germany, entirely within the imperial territory of\r\nAlsace-Lorraine. It rises on a north foothill of the Jura, S.W. of\r\nBasel, and flows N.N.E. parallel with the Rhine, which it enters from\r\nthe left, 9 m. below Strassburg. Its course lies for the most part\r\nthrough low meadowland; and the stream, which is 123 m. long, receives\r\nnumerous small affluents, which pour out of the short narrow valleys of\r\nthe Vosges. It is navigable from Ladhof near Colmar to its confluence\r\nwith the Rhine, a distance of 59 m. It is on this river, and not on the\r\nRhine, that the principal towns of Upper Alsace are situated, e.g.\r\nMülhausen, Colmarl, Schlettstadt and Strassburg. The Ill feeds two\r\nimportant canals, the Rhine-Marne canal and the Rhine-Rhone canal, both\r\nstarting from the neighbourhood of Strassburg.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nILLAWARRA, a beautiful and fertile district of New South Wales,\r\nAustralia, extending from a point 33 m. S. of Sydney, along the coast\r\nsouthwards for 40 m. to Shoalhaven. It is thickly populated, and\r\nsupplies Sydney with the greater part of its dairy produce. There are\r\nalso numerous collieries, producing coal of superior quality, and iron\r\nore, fireclay and freestone are plentiful. The Illawarra Lake, a salt\r\nlagoon, 9 m. long and 3 m. wide, is encircled by hills and is connected\r\nwith the sea by a narrow channel; quantities of fish are caught in it\r\nand wild fowl are abundant along its shores. The chief towns in the\r\ndistrict are Wollongong, Kiama, Clifton and Shellharbour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nILLE-ET-VILAINE, a maritime department of north-western France, formed\r\nin 1790 out of the eastern part of the old province of Brittany. Pop.\r\n(1906) 611,805. Area 2699 sq. m. It is bounded N. by the English\r\nChannel, the Bay of St Michel and the department of Manche; E. by\r\nMayenne; S. by Loire-Inférieure; and W. by Morbihan and Côtes-du-Nord.\r\nThe territory of Ille-et-Vilaine constitutes a depression bordered by\r\nhills which reach their maximum altitudes (over 800 ft.) in the N.E. and\r\nW. of the department. The centre of this depression, which separates the\r\nhills of Brittany from those of Normandy, is occupied by Rennes, capital\r\nof the department and an important junction of roads, rivers and\r\nrailways. The department takes its name from its two principal rivers,\r\nthe Ille and the Vilaine. The former joins the Vilaine at Rennes after a\r\ncourse of 18 m. through the centre of the department; and the latter,\r\nwhich rises in Mayenne, flows westwards as far as Rennes, where it turns\r\nabruptly south. The stream is tidal up to the port of Redon, and is\r\nnavigable for barges as far as Rennes. The Vilaine receives the Meu and\r\nthe Seiche, which are both navigable. There are two other navigable\r\nstreams, the Airon and the Rance, the long estuary of which falls almost\r\nentirely within the department. The Ille-et-Rance canal connects the\r\ntown of Rennes with those of Dinan and St Malo. The greater portion of\r\nthe shore of the Bay of St Michel is covered by the Marsh of Dol,\r\nvaluable agricultural land, which is protected from the inroads of the\r\nsea by dykes. Towards the open channel the coast is rocky. Small lakes\r\nare frequent in the interior of the department. The climate is\r\ntemperate, humid and free from sudden changes. The south-west winds,\r\nwhile they keep the temperature mild, also bring frequent showers, and\r\nin spring and autumn thick fogs prevail. The soil is thin and not very\r\nfertile, but has been improved by the use of artificial manure. Cereals\r\nof all kinds are grown, but the principal are wheat, buckwheat, oats and\r\nbarley. Potatoes, early vegetables, flax and hemp are also largely\r\ngrown, and tobacco is cultivated in the arrondissement of St Malo.\r\nApples and pears are the principal fruit, and the cider of the canton of\r\nDol has a high reputation. Cheese is made in considerable quantities,\r\nand the butter of Rennes is amongst the best in France. Large numbers of\r\nhorses and cattle are raised. Mines of iron, lead and zinc (Pont-Péan)\r\nand quarries of slate, granite, &c., are worked. There are flour and\r\nsaw-mills, brick works, boat-building yards, iron and copper foundries\r\nand forges, dyeworks, and a widespread tanning industry. Sail-cloth,\r\nrope, pottery, boots and shoes (Fougères), edge-tools, nails, farming\r\nimplements, paper and furniture are also among the products of the\r\ndepartment. The chief ports are St Malo and St Servan. Fishing is very\r\nactive on the coast, and St Malo, St Servan and Cancale equip fleets for\r\nthe Newfoundland cod-banks. There are also important oyster-fisheries in\r\nthe Bay of St Michel, especially at Cancale. The little town of Dinard\r\nis well known as a fashionable bathing-resort. Exports include\r\nagricultural products, butter, mine-posts and dried fish; imports,\r\nlive-stock, coal, timber, building materials and American wheat. The\r\ndepartment is served by the Western railway, and has over 130 m. of\r\nnavigable waterway. The population is of less distinctively Celtic\r\norigin than the Bretons of Western Brittany, between whom and the\r\nNormans and Angevins it forms a transitional group. Ille-et-Vilaine is\r\ndivided into the arrondissements of Fougères, St Malo, Montfort-sur-Meu,\r\nRedon, Rennes and Vitré, with 43 cantons and 360 communes. The chief\r\ntown is Rennes, which is the seat of an archbishop and of a court of\r\nappeal, headquarters of the X. army corps, and the centre of an académie\r\n(educational division).\r\n\r\nIn addition to the capital, Fougères, St Malo, St Servan, Redon, Vitré,\r\nDol, Dinard and Cancale are the towns of chief importance and are\r\nseparately noticed. At Combourg there is a picturesque château of the\r\n14th and 15th centuries where Chateaubriand passed a portion of his\r\nearly life. St Aubin-du-Cormier has the ruins of an important feudal\r\nfortress of the 13th century built by the dukes of Brittany for the\r\nprotection of their eastern frontier. Montfort-sur-Meu has a cylindrical\r\nkeep of the 15th century which is a survival of its old ramparts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nILLEGITIMACY (from \"illegitimate,\" Lat. _illegitimus_, not in accordance\r\nwith law, hence born out of lawful wedlock), the state of being of\r\nillegitimate birth. The law dealing with the legitimation of children\r\nborn out of wedlock will be found under LEGITIMACY AND LEGITIMATION. How\r\nfar the prevalence of illegitimacy in any community can be taken as a\r\nguide to the morality of that community is a much disputed question. The\r\nphenomenon itself varies so much in different localities, even in\r\nlocalities where the same factors seem to prevail, that affirmative\r\nconclusions are for the most part impossible to draw. In the United\r\nKingdom, where the figures differ considerably for the three\r\ncountries--England, Scotland, Ireland--the reasons that might be\r\nassigned for the differences are negatived if applied on the same lines,\r\nas they might well be, to certain other countries. Then again, racial,\r\nclimatic and social differences must be allowed for, and the influence\r\nof legislation is to be taken into account. The fact that in some\r\ncountries marriage is forbidden until a man has completed his military\r\nservice, in another, that consent of parents is requisite, in another,\r\nthat \"once a bastard always a bastard\" is the rule, while in yet another\r\nthat the merest of subsequent formalities will legitimize the offspring,\r\nmust account in some degree for variations in figures.\r\n\r\n  TABLE I.--_Illegitimate Births per 1000 Births (excluding\r\n  still-born)._\r\n\r\n  +------------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n  |                  |1876-|1881-|1886-|1891-|1896-|1901-|\r\n  |                  |1880.|1885.|1890.|1895.|1900.|1905.|\r\n  +------------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n  | England and Wales|  48 |  48 |  46 |  42 |  41 |  40 |\r\n  | Scotland         |  85 |  83 |  81 |  74 |  68 |  64 |\r\n  | Ireland          |  24 |  27 |  28 |  36 |  36 |  26 |\r\n  | Denmark          | 101 | 100 |  95 |  94 |  96 | 101 |\r\n  | Norway           |  84 |  81 |  75 |  71 |  74 |  .. |\r\n  | Sweden           | 100 | 102 | 103 | 105 | 113 |  .. |\r\n  | Finland          |  73 |  70 |  65 |  65 |  66 |  .. |\r\n  | Russia           |  28 |  27 |  27 |  27 |  27 |  .. |\r\n  | Austria          | 138 | 145 | 147 | 146 | 141 |  .. |\r\n  | Hungary          |  73 |  79 |  82 |  85 |  90 |  94 |\r\n  | Switzerland      |  47 |  48 |  47 |  46 |  45 |  .. |\r\n  | Germany          |  87 |  92 |  92 |  91 |  90 |  84 |\r\n  | Netherlands      |  31 |  30 |  32 |  31 |  27 |  23 |\r\n  | Belgium          |  74 |  82 |  87 |  88 |  80 |  68 |\r\n  | France           |  72 |  78 |  83 |  87 |  88 |  88 |\r\n  | Portugal         |  .. |  .. | 123 | 122 | 121 |  .. |\r\n  | Spain            |  .. |  .. |  .. |  .. |  49 |  44 |\r\n  | Italy            |  72 |  76 |  74 |  69 |  62 |  56 |\r\n  | New South Wales  |  42 |  44 |  49 |  60 |  69 |  70 |\r\n  | Victoria         |  43 |  46 |  49 |  60 |  69 |  70 |\r\n  | Queensland       |  39 |  41 |  44 |  48 |  59 |  65 |\r\n  | South Australia  |  .. |  22 |  25 |  30 |  38 |  41 |\r\n  | West Australia   |  .. |  .. |  .. |  48 |  51 |  42 |\r\n  | Tasmania         |  .. |  44 |  38 |  46 |  57 |  .. |\r\n  | New Zealand      |  23 |  29 |  32 |  38 |  44 |  45 |\r\n  +------------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n\r\nTable I. gives the number of illegitimate births per 1000 births in\r\nvarious countries of the world for quinquennial periods. It is to be\r\nnoted that still-born births are excluded, as in the United Kingdom\r\n(contrary to the practice prevailing in most European countries)\r\nregistration of such births is not compulsory. The United States is\r\nomitted, as there is no national system of registration of births.\r\n\r\nThis method of measuring illegitimacy by ascertaining the proportion of\r\nillegitimate births in every thousand births is a fairly accurate one,\r\nbut there is another valuable one which is often applied, that of\r\ncomparing the number of illegitimate births with each thousand unmarried\r\nfemales at the child-bearing age the \"corrected\" rate as opposed to the\r\n\"crude,\" as it is usually termed. This is given for certain countries\r\nin Table II.\r\n\r\n  TABLE II.--_Illegitimate Births to 1000 Unmarried and Widowed Females,\r\n  aged 15-49 years._\r\n\r\n  +------------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+----------+\r\n  |     Country.     |1846-55.|1856-65.|1866-75.|1876-85.|1886-95.|1896-1905.|\r\n  +------------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+----------+\r\n  | England and Wales|   17   |   18   |   16   |   13   |   10   |     8    |\r\n  | Scotland         |   ..   |   22   |   23   |   20   |   17   |    13    |\r\n  | Ireland          |   ..   |   ..   |    5   |    4   |    5   |     3    |\r\n  | Denmark          |   ..   |   28   |   27   |   26   |   24   |    23    |\r\n  | Sweden           |   20   |   22   |   23   |   22   |   22   |    ..    |\r\n  | Germany          |   ..   |   ..   |   ..   |   28   |   27   |    26    |\r\n  | Netherlands      |   ..   |   ..   |   10   |    9   |    9   |     6    |\r\n  | Belgium          |   16   |   16   |   17   |   19   |   17   |    17    |\r\n  | France           |   15   |   17   |   17   |   16   |   17   |    18    |\r\n  | Italy            |   ..   |   ..   |   ..   |   24   |   24   |    19    |\r\n  +------------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+----------+\r\n\r\nThe generally accepted idea that the inhabitants of the warmer countries\r\nof the south of Europe are more ardent in temperament has at least no\r\nsupport as shown in the figures in Table I., where we find a higher rate\r\nof illegitimacy in Sweden and Denmark than in Spain or Italy. Religion,\r\nhowever, must be taken into account as having a strong influence in\r\npreventing unchastity, though it cannot be concluded that any particular\r\ncreed is more powerful in this direction than another; for example, the\r\nfigures for Austria and Ireland are very different. It cannot be said,\r\neither, that figures bear out the statement that where there is a high\r\nrate of illegitimacy there is little prostitution. It is more probable\r\nthat in a country where the standard of living is low, and early\r\nmarriages are the rule, the illegitimate birth-rate will be low. As\r\nregards England and Wales, the illegitimate birth-rate has been steadily\r\ndeclining for many years, not only in actual numbers, but also in\r\nproportion to the population.\r\n\r\n  TABLE III.--_England and Wales._\r\n\r\n  +------+--------------+-------------+--------------+\r\n  |      | Illegitimate | Proportion  | Illegitimate |\r\n  | Year.|   Births.    | to 1000 of  |   Births in  |\r\n  |      |              | population. | 1000 Births. |\r\n  +------+--------------+-------------+--------------+\r\n  | 1860 |    43,693    |     2.2     |      64      |\r\n  | 1865 |    46,585    |     2.2     |      62      |\r\n  | 1870 |    44,737    |     2.0     |      56      |\r\n  | 1875 |    40,813    |     1.7     |      48      |\r\n  | 1880 |    42,542    |     1.6     |      48      |\r\n  | 1885 |    42,793    |     1.6     |      48      |\r\n  | 1890 |    38,412    |     1.3     |      44      |\r\n  | 1895 |    38,836    |     1.3     |      42      |\r\n  | 1900 |    36,814    |     1.1     |      40      |\r\n  | 1905 |    37,515    |     1.1     |      40      |\r\n  | 1907 |    36,189    |     1.0     |      39      |\r\n  +------+--------------+-------------+--------------+\r\n\r\nThe corrected rate bears out the result shown in Table III as follows:\r\n\r\n  TABLE IV.--_England and Wales.

Table VI. gives\r\nthe \"corrected\" rate for certain three-year periods. In connexion with\r\nthese tables the following extract from the Registrar-General's _Report_\r\nfor 1907 (p. xxx.) is important.\r\n\r\n  \"It is difficult to explain the variations in the rates of\r\n  illegitimacy in the several counties. It may be stated generally that\r\n  the proportion of illegitimate children cannot alone serve as a\r\n  standard of morality. Broadly speaking, however, the single and\r\n  widowed women in London, in the counties south of the Thames, and in\r\n  the south-western counties have comparatively few illegitimate\r\n  children; on the other hand, the number of illegitimate children is\r\n  comparatively high in Shropshire, in Herefordshire, in Staffordshire,\r\n  in Nottinghamshire, in Cumberland, in North Wales, and also in nearly\r\n  all the counties on the eastern seaboard, viz. Suffolk, Norfolk,\r\n  Lincolnshire, the East and North Ridings of Yorkshire, and Durham. In\r\n  the Registrar-General's Report for the year 1851 it was assumed that\r\n  there was an indirect connexion between female illiteracy and\r\n  illegitimacy. This may have been the case in the middle of the last\r\n  century, but there is no conclusive evidence that such is the case at\r\n  the present day. The proportions of illegitimacy and the proportions\r\n  of married women who signed the marriage register by mark are\r\n  relatively high in Staffordshire, in North Wales, in Durham and in the\r\n  North Riding of Yorkshire; on the other hand, in Norfolk, in Suffolk\r\n  and in Lincolnshire there is a comparatively high proportion of\r\n  illegitimacy and a low proportion of illiteracy.\"\r\n\r\n  TABLE X.--_Ireland.

I.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nILLER, a river of Bavaria, rising in the south-west extremity of the\r\nkingdom, among the Algäuer Alps. Taking a northerly course, it quits the\r\nmountains at Immenstadt, and, flowing by Kempten, from which point it is\r\nnavigable for rafts, forms for some distance the boundary between\r\nBavaria and Württemberg, and eventually strikes the Danube (right bank)\r\njust above Ulm. Its total length is 103 m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nILLINOIS, a North Central state of the United States of America,\r\nsituated between 37° and 42° 30´ N. lat. and 87° 35´ and 91° 40´ W.\r\nlong. It is bounded N. by Wisconsin, E. by Lake Michigan and Indiana,\r\nS.E. and S. by the Ohio river, which separates it from Kentucky, and\r\nS.W. and W. by the Mississippi river, which separates it from Missouri\r\nand Iowa. The Enabling Act of Congress, which provided for the\r\norganization of Illinois Territory into a state, extended its\r\njurisdiction to the middle of Lake Michigan and the Mississippi river;\r\nconsequently the total area of the state is 58,329 sq. m., of which 2337\r\nsq. m. are water surface, though the official figures of the United\r\nStates Geological Survey, which does not take into account this\r\nextension of jurisdiction, are 56,665 sq. m.\r\n\r\n  _Physiography._--Physiographically, the state (except the extreme\r\n  southern point) lies wholly in the Prairie Plains region. The N.E.\r\n  corner is by some placed in the \"Great Lakes District.\" The southern\r\n  point touches the Coastal Plain Belt at its northward extension called\r\n  the \"Mississippi Embayment.\" The surface of Illinois is an inclined\r\n  plane, whose general slope is toward the S. and S.W. The average\r\n  elevation above sea-level is about 600 ft.; the highest elevation is\r\n  Charles Mound (1257 ft.), on the Illinois-Wisconsin boundary line, one\r\n  of a chain of hills that crosses Jo Daviess, Stephenson, Winnebago,\r\n  Boone and McHenry counties. An elevation from 6 to 10 m. wide crosses\r\n  the southern part of the state from Grand Tower, in Jackson county, on\r\n  the Mississippi to Shawneetown, in Gallatin county, on the Ohio, the\r\n  highest point being 1047 ft. above the sea; from Grand Tower N. along\r\n  the Mississippi to the mouth of the Illinois there is a slight\r\n  elevation and there is another elevation of minor importance along the\r\n  Wabash. Many of the river bluffs rise to an unusual height, Starved\r\n  Rock, near Ottawa, in La Salle county, being 150 ft. above the bed of\r\n  the Illinois river. Cave in Rock, on the Ohio, in Hardin county, was\r\n  once the resort of river pirates. The country S. of the elevation\r\n  (mentioned above) between Grand Tower and Shawneetown was originally\r\n  covered with forests.\r\n\r\n  The drainage of Illinois is far better than its low elevation and\r\n  comparatively level surface would suggest. There are more than 275\r\n  streams in the state, grouped in two river systems, one having the\r\n  Mississippi, which receives three-fourths of the waters of Illinois,\r\n  as outlet, the other being tributary to the Wabash or Ohio rivers. The\r\n  most important river is the Illinois, which, formed by the junction of\r\n  the Des Plaines and the Kankakee, in the N.E. part of Grundy county,\r\n  crosses the N. central and W. portions of the state, draining 24,726\r\n  sq. m. At some points, notably at Lake Peoria, it broadens into vast\r\n  expanses resembling lakes. The Kaskaskia, in the S., notable for its\r\n  variations in volume, and the Rock, in the N., are the other important\r\n  rivers emptying into the Mississippi; the Embarrass and Little Wabash,\r\n  the Saline and Cache in the E., are the important tributaries of the\r\n  Wabash and Ohio rivers. The Chicago river, a short stream 1 m. long,\r\n  formed by the union of its N. and S. branches, naturally flowed into\r\n  Lake Michigan, but by the construction of the Chicago Drainage Canal\r\n  its waters were turned in 1900 so that they ultimately flow into the\r\n  Mississippi.\r\n\r\n  The soil of Illinois is remarkable for its fertility. The surface\r\n  soils are composed of drift deposits, varying from 10 to 200 ft. in\r\n  depth; they are often overlaid with a black loam 10 to 15 in. deep,\r\n  and in a large portion of the state there is a subsoil of yellow clay.\r\n  The soil of the prairies is darker and coarser than that of the\r\n  forests, but all differences disappear with cultivation. The soil of\r\n  the river valleys is alluvial and especially fertile, the \"American\r\n  Bottom,\" extending along the Mississippi from Alton to Chester, having\r\n  been in cultivation for more than 150 years. Along the river bluffs\r\n  there is a silicious deposit called loess, which is well suited to the\r\n  cultivation of fruits and vegetables. In general the N. part of the\r\n  state is especially suited to the cultivation of hay, the N. and\r\n  central parts to Indian corn, the E. to oats, and the S.W. to wheat.\r\n\r\n  _Climate._--The climate of Illinois is notable for its extremes of\r\n  temperature. The warm winds which sweep up the Mississippi Valley from\r\n  the Gulf of Mexico are responsible for the extremes of heat, and the\r\n  Arctic winds of the north, which find no mountain range to break their\r\n  strength, cause the extremes of cold. The mean annual temperature at\r\n  Winnebago, near the N. border, is 47° F., and it increases to the\r\n  southward at the rate of about 2° for every degree of latitude, being\r\n  52° F. at Springfield, and 58° F. in Cairo, at the S. extremity. The\r\n  lowest temperature ever recorded in the state was -32° F., in February\r\n  1905, at Ashton in the N.W. and the highest was 115° F., in July 1901,\r\n  at Centralia, in the S., making a maximum range of 147° F. The range\r\n  of extremes is considerably greater in the N. than in the S.; for\r\n  example, at Winnebago extremes have ranged from -26° F. to 110° F. or\r\n  136° F., but at Cairo they have ranged only from -16° F. to 106° F. or\r\n  122° F. The mean annual precipitation is about 39 in. in the S.\r\n  counties, but this decreases to the northward, being about 36 in. in\r\n  the central counties and 34 in. along the N. border. The mean annual\r\n  snowfall increases from 12 in. at the S. extremity to approximately 40\r\n  in. in the N. counties. In the N. the precipitation is 44.8% greater\r\n  in spring and summer than it is in autumn and winter, but in the S.\r\n  only 26.17% greater. At Cairo the prevailing winds are southerly\r\n  during all months except February, and as far north as Springfield\r\n  they are southerly from April to January; but throughout the N. half\r\n  of the state, except along the shore of Lake Michigan, where they vary\r\n  from N.E. to S.W., the winds are mostly from the W. or N.W. from\r\n  October to March and very variable for the remainder of the year. The\r\n  dampness and miasma, to which so many of the early settlers' fatal\r\n  \"chills and fever\" were due, have practically disappeared before\r\n  modern methods of sanitary drainage.\r\n\r\n  _Fauna and Flora._--The fauna and flora, which are similar to those of\r\n  the other North Central States of North America, impressed the early\r\n  explorers with their richness and variety. \"We have seen nothing like\r\n  this for the fertility of the land, its prairies, woods, and wild\r\n  cattle,\" wrote Père Jacques Marquette of the Illinois region, and\r\n  later explorers also bore witness to the richness of the country. Many\r\n  of the original wild animals, such as the bison, bear, beaver, deer\r\n  and lynx, have disappeared; wolves, foxes and mink are rare; but\r\n  rabbits, squirrels and raccoons are still common. The fish are mainly\r\n  the coarser species, such as carp, buffalo-fish and white perch; of\r\n  better food fish, the principal varieties are bass (black, striped and\r\n  rock), crappie, pike, \"jack salmon\" or wall-eyed pike, and sun fish.\r\n  The yield of the fisheries in 1900 was valued at $388,876. The most\r\n  important fisheries on the Illinois river and its tributaries were at\r\n  Havana, Pekin and Peoria, which in 1907-1908 were represented by a\r\n  total catch of about 10,000,000 lb., out of a total for this river\r\n  system of 17,570,000 lb. The flora is varied. Great numbers of grasses\r\n  and flowering plants which once beautified the prairie landscape are\r\n  still found on uncultivated lands, and there are about 80 species of\r\n  trees, of which the oak, hickory, maple and ash are the most common.\r\n  The cypress is found only in the S. and the tamarack only in the N.\r\n  The forest area, estimated at 10,200 sq. m. in 1900, is almost wholly\r\n  in the southern counties, and nearly all the trees which the northern\r\n  half of the state had before the coming of the whites were along the\r\n  banks of streams. Among wild fruits are the cherry, plum, grape,\r\n  strawberry, blackberry and raspberry.\r\n\r\n_Industry and Commerce._--The fertility of the soil, the mineral wealth\r\nand the transportation facilities have given Illinois a vast economic\r\ndevelopment. In 1900 more than seven-tenths of the inhabitants in\r\ngainful occupations were engaged in agriculture (25.6%), manufactures\r\nand mechanical pursuits (26.7%), and trade and transportation (22%).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map of Illinois.]\r\n\r\n  Historically and comparatively, agriculture is the most important\r\n  industry. In 1900 about nine-tenths of the total land area was\r\n  inclosed in farms; the value of farm property ($2,004,316,897) was\r\n  greater than that of any other state; as regards the total value of\r\n  farm products in 1899 Illinois was surpassed only by Iowa; in the\r\n  value of crops Illinois led all the states, and the values of property\r\n  and of products were respectively 35.6% and 87.1% greater than at the\r\n  end of the preceding decade. During the last half of the 19th century\r\n  the number of farms increased rapidly, and the average size declined\r\n  from 158 acres in 1850 to 127.6 acres in 1870 and 124.2 acres in 1900.\r\n  The prevailing form of tenure is that of owners, 60.7% of the farms\r\n  being so operated in 1900; but during the decade 1890-1900 the number\r\n  of farms cultivated by cash tenants increased 30.8%, and the number by\r\n  share tenants 24.5%, while the increase of cultivation by owners was\r\n  only 1%. In proportion of farm land improved (84.5%), Illinois was\r\n  surpassed only by Iowa among the states. Cereals form the most\r\n  important agricultural product (600,107,378 bushels in 1899--in value\r\n  about three-fourths of the total agricultural products of the state).\r\n  In the production of cereals Illinois surpassed the other states at\r\n  the close of each decade during the last half of the 19th century\r\n  except that ending in 1890, when Iowa was the leading state. Indian\r\n  corn and oats are the most valuable crops. The rank of Illinois in the\r\n  production of Indian corn was first in 1899 with about one-fifth of\r\n  the total product of the United States, and first in 1907[1] with\r\n  nearly one-tenth of the total crop of the country (9,521,000 bushels\r\n  out of 99,931,000). In 1879, in 1899 and in 1905 (when it produced\r\n  132,779,762 bushels out of 953,216,197 from the entire country) it was\r\n  first among the states producing oats, but it was surpassed by Iowa in\r\n  1889, 1906 and 1907; in 1907 the Illinois crop was 101,675,000\r\n  bushels. From 1850 until 1879 Illinois also led in the production of\r\n  wheat; the competition of the more western states, however, caused a\r\n  great decline in both acreage and production of that cereal, the\r\n  state's rank in the number of bushels produced declining to third in\r\n  1889 and to fourteenth in 1899, but the crop and yield per acre in\r\n  1902 was larger than any since 1894; in 1905 the state ranked ninth,\r\n  in 1906 eighth and in 1907 fifth (the crop being 40,104,000 bushels)\r\n  among the wheat-growing states of the country. The rank of the state\r\n  in the growing of rye also declined from second in 1879 to eighth in\r\n  1899 and to ninth in 1907 (when the crop was 1,106,000 bushels), and\r\n  the rank in the growing of barley from third in 1869 to sixteenth in\r\n  1899. In 1907 the barley crop was 600,000 bushels. Hay and forage are,\r\n  after cereals, the most important crops; in 1907 2,664,000 acres\r\n  produced 3,730,000 tons of hay valued at $41,030,000. Potatoes and\r\n  broom corn are other valuable products. The potato crop in 1907 was\r\n  13,398,000 bushels, valued at $9,647,000, and the sugar beet, first\r\n  introduced during the last decade of the 19th century, gave promise of\r\n  becoming one of the most important crops. From 1889 to 1899 there was\r\n  a distinct decline in the production of apples and peaches, but there\r\n  was a great increase in that of cherries, plums and pears. The large\r\n  urban population of the state makes the animal products very valuable,\r\n  Illinois ranking third in 1900 in the number of dairy cows, and in the\r\n  farm value of dairy products; indeed, all classes of live stock,\r\n  except sheep, increased in number from 1850 to 1900, and at the end of\r\n  the latter year Illinois was surpassed only by Iowa in the number of\r\n  horses and swine; in 1909 there were more horses in Illinois than in\r\n  Iowa. Important influences in the agricultural development of the\r\n  state have been the formation of Farmers' Institutes, organized in\r\n  1895, a Corn Breeders' Association in 1898, and the introduction of\r\n  fertilizers, the use of which in 1899 was nearly seven times the\r\n  amount in 1889, and the study of soils, carried on by the State\r\n  Department of Agriculture and the United States Department of\r\n  Agriculture.\r\n\r\n  The growth of manufacturing in Illinois during the last half of the\r\n  19th century, due largely to the development of her exceptional\r\n  transportation facilities, was the most rapid and remarkable in the\r\n  industrial history of the United States. In 1850 the state ranked\r\n  fifteenth, in 1860 eighth, in 1870 sixth, in 1880 fourth, in 1890 and\r\n  again in 1900 third, in the value of its manufactures. The average\r\n  increases of invested capital and products for each decade from\r\n  1850-1900 were, respectively, 189.26% and 152.9%; in 1900 the capital\r\n  invested ($776,829,598, of which $732,829,771 was in establishments\r\n  under the \"factory system\"), and the product ($1,259,730,168, of which\r\n  $1,120,868,308 was from establishments under the \"factory system\"),\r\n  showed unusually small percentages of increase over those for 1890\r\n  (54.7% and 38.6% respectively); and in 1905 the capital and product of\r\n  establishments under the \"factory system\" were respectively\r\n  $975,844,799 and $1,410,342,129, showing increases of 33.2% and 25.8%\r\n  over the corresponding figures for 1900.\r\n\r\n  The most important industry was the wholesale slaughtering and packing\r\n  of meats, which yielded 22.9% of the total manufactured product of the\r\n  state in 1900, and 22.5% of the total in 1905. From 1870 to 1905\r\n  Illinois surpassed the other states in this industry, yielding in 1900\r\n  and in 1905 more than one-third of the total product of the United\r\n  States. The increase in the value of the product in this industry in\r\n  Illinois between 1900 and 1905 was over 10%. An interesting phase of\r\n  the industry is the secondary enterprises that have developed from it,\r\n  nearly all portions of the slaughtered animal being finally put to\r\n  use. The blood is converted into clarifying material, the entrails are\r\n  used for sausage coverings, the hoofs and small bones furnish the raw\r\n  material for the manufacture of glue, the large bones are carved into\r\n  knife handles, and the horns into combs, the fats are made to yield\r\n  butterine, lard and soap, and the hides and hair are used in the\r\n  manufacture of mattresses and felts.\r\n\r\n  The manufacture of iron and steel products, and of products depending\r\n  upon iron and steel as raw material, is second in importance. The iron\r\n  for these industries is secured from the Lake Superior region, the\r\n  coal and limestone from mines within the state. Indeed, in the\r\n  manufacture of iron and steel, Illinois was surpassed in 1900 only by\r\n  Pennsylvania and Ohio, the 1900 product being valued at $60,303,144;\r\n  but the value of foundry and machine shop products was even greater\r\n  ($63,878,352). In 1905 the iron and steel product had increased in\r\n  value since 1900 44.9%, to $87,352,761; the foundry and machine shop\r\n  products 25.2%, to $79,961,482; and the wire product showed even\r\n  greater increase, largely because of a difference of classification in\r\n  the two censuses, the value in 1905 being $14,099,566, as against\r\n  $2,879,188 in 1900, showing an increase of nearly 390%. The\r\n  development of agriculture, by creating a demand for improved farm\r\n  machinery, has stimulated the inventive genius; in many cases\r\n  blacksmith shops have been transformed into machinery factories; also\r\n  well-established companies of the eastern states have been induced to\r\n  remove to Illinois by the low prices of iron and wood, due to cheap\r\n  transportation rates on the Great Lakes. Consequently, in 1890, in\r\n  1900 and again in 1905, Illinois surpassed any one of the other states\r\n  in the production of agricultural implements, the product in 1900\r\n  being valued at $42,033,796, or 41.5% of the total output of\r\n  agricultural machinery in the United States; and in 1905 with a value\r\n  of $38,412,452 it represented 34.3% of the product of the entire\r\n  country. In the building of railway cars by manufacturing\r\n  corporations, Illinois also led the states in 1900 and in 1905, the\r\n  product being valued at $24,845,606 in 1900 and at $30,926,464 (an\r\n  increase of nearly one-fourth) in 1905; and in construction by railway\r\n  companies was second in 1900, with a product valued at $16,580,424,\r\n  which had increased 53.7% in 1905, when the product was valued at\r\n  $25,491,209. The greatest increase of products between 1890 and 1900\r\n  was in the manufacture of electrical apparatus (2400%), in which the\r\n  increase in value of product was 37.2% between 1900 and 1905.\r\n\r\n  Another class of manufactures consists of those dependent upon\r\n  agricultural products for raw material. Of these, the manufacture of\r\n  distilled liquors was in 1900 and in 1905 the most important, Illinois\r\n  leading the other states; the value of the 1900 product, which was\r\n  nearly 12% less than that of 1890, was increased by 41.6%, to\r\n  $54,101,805, in 1905. Peoria, the centre of the industry, is the\r\n  largest producer of whisky and high-class wines of the cities in the\r\n  United States. There were also, in 1900, 35 direct and other indirect\r\n  products made from Indian corn by glucose plants, which consumed\r\n  one-fifth of the Indian corn product of the state, and the value of\r\n  these products was $18,122,814; in 1905 it was only $14,532,180. Of\r\n  other manufactures dependent upon agriculture, flour and grist mill\r\n  products declined between 1890 and 1900, but between 1900 and 1905\r\n  increased 39.6% to a value of $39,892,127. The manufacture of cheese,\r\n  butter and condensed milk increased 60% between 1890 and 1900, but\r\n  between 1900 and 1905 only 3.1%, the product in 1905 being valued at\r\n  $13,276,533.\r\n\r\n  Other prosperous industries are the manufacture of lumber and timber\r\n  products (the raw material being floated down the Mississippi river\r\n  from the forests of other states), whose output increased from 1890 to\r\n  1900 nearly 50%, but declined slightly between 1900 and 1905; of\r\n  furniture ($22,131,846 in 1905; $15,285,475 in 1900; showing an\r\n  increase of 44.8%), and of musical instruments ($13,323,358 in 1905;\r\n  $8,156,445 in 1900; an increase of 63.3% in the period), in both of\r\n  which Illinois was second in 1900 and in 1905; book and job printing,\r\n  in which the state ranked second in 1900 ($28,293,684 in 1905;\r\n  $19,761,780 in 1900; an increase of 43.2%), newspaper and periodical\r\n  printing ($28,644,981 in 1905; $19,404,955 in 1900; an increase of\r\n  47.6%), in which it ranked third in 1900; and the manufacture of\r\n  clothing, boots and shoes. The value of the clothing manufactured in\r\n  1905 was $67,439,617 (men's $55,202,999; women's $12,236,618), an\r\n  increase of 30.1% over 1900. The great manufacturing centre is\r\n  Chicago, where more than seven-tenths of the manufactured products of\r\n  the state were produced in 1900, and more than two-thirds in 1905.\r\n\r\n  In this development of manufactures, the mineral resources have been\r\n  an important influence, nearly one-fourth (23.6%) of the manufactured\r\n  product in 1900 depending upon minerals for raw material. Although the\r\n  iron ore, for the iron and steel industry, is furnished by the mines\r\n  of the Lake Superior region, bituminous coal and limestone are\r\n  supplied by the Illinois deposits. The great central coal field of\r\n  North America extends into Illinois from Indiana as far N. as a line\r\n  from the N. boundary of Grundy county to Rock Island, W. from Rock\r\n  Island to Henderson county, then S.W. to the southern part of Jackson\r\n  county, when it runs S. into Kentucky, thus including more than\r\n  three-fourths (42,900 sq. m.) of the land surface of the state. In\r\n  1679 Hennepin reported deposits of coal near what is now Ottawa on the\r\n  Illinois; there was some mining in 1810 on the Big Muddy river in\r\n  Jackson county; and in 1833, 6000 tons were mined. In 1907 (according\r\n  to state authorities) coal was produced in 52 counties, Williamson,\r\n  Sangamon, St Clair, Macoupin and Madison giving the largest yield. In\r\n  that year the tonnage was 51,317,146, and the value of the total\r\n  product $54,687,882; in 1908 the value of the state's product of coal\r\n  was exceeded only by that of Pennsylvania (nearly six times as great).\r\n  Nearly 30% of all coal mined in the state was mined by machinery in\r\n  1907. The output of petroleum in Illinois was long unimportant. The\r\n  first serious attempts to find oil and gas in the state were in the\r\n  'fifties of the 19th century. In 1889 the yield of petroleum was 1460\r\n  barrels. In 1902 it was only 200 barrels, nearly all of which came\r\n  from Litchfield, Montgomery county (where oil had been found in\r\n  commercial quantities in 1886), and Washington, Tazewell county, in\r\n  the west central part of the state; at this time it was used locally\r\n  for lubricating purposes. There had been some drilling in Clark county\r\n  in 1865, and in 1904 this field was again worked at Westfield. In 1905\r\n  the total output of the state was 181,084 barrels; in 1906 the amount\r\n  increased to 4,397,050 barrels, valued at $3,274,818; and in 1907,\r\n  according to state reports, the output was 24,281,973 barrels, being\r\n  nearly as great as that of the Appalachian field. The\r\n  petroleum-producing area of commercial importance is a strip of land\r\n  about 80 m. long and 2 or 3 to 10 or 12 m. wide in the S.E. part of\r\n  the state, centring about Crawford county. In April 1906 the first\r\n  pipe lines for petroleum in Illinois were laid; before that time all\r\n  shipments had been in tank cars. In connexion with petroleum, natural\r\n  gas has been found, especially in Clark and Crawford counties; in 1906\r\n  the state's product of natural gas was valued at $87,211. Limestone is\r\n  found in about 30 counties, principally Cook, Will and Kankakee; the\r\n  value of the product in 1906 was $2,942,331. Clay and clay products of\r\n  the state were valued in 1906 at $12,765,453. Deposits of lead and\r\n  zinc have been discovered and worked in Jo Daviess county, near Galena\r\n  and Elizabeth, in the N.W. part of the state. A southern district,\r\n  including parts of Hardin, Pope and Saline counties, has produced,\r\n  incidentally to fluorspar, some lead, the maximum amount being 176,387\r\n  lb. from the Fairview mine in 1866-1867. In 1905 the zinc from the\r\n  entire state was valued at $5,499,508; the lead product in 1906 was\r\n  valued at $65,208. Sandstone, quarried in 10 counties, was valued in\r\n  1905 at $29,115 and in 1906 at $19,125. Pope and Hardin counties were\r\n  the only sources of fluorspar in the United States from 1842 until\r\n  1898, when fluorspar began to be mined in Kentucky; in 1906 the output\r\n  was 28,268 tons, valued at $160,623, and in 1905 33,275 tons, valued\r\n  at $220,206. The centre of the fluorspar district was Rosiclare in\r\n  Hardin county. The cement deposits are also of value, natural cement\r\n  being valued at $118,221 and Portland cement at $2,461,494 in 1906.\r\n  Iron ore has been discovered. Glass sand is obtained from the Illinois\r\n  river valley in La Salle county; in 1906 it was valued at $156,684,\r\n  making the state in this product second only to Pennsylvania and West\r\n  Virginia (in 1905 it was second only to Pennsylvania). The value of\r\n  the total mineral product of the state in 1906 was estimated at\r\n  $121,188,306.[2]\r\n\r\n_Communications._--Transportation facilities have been an important\r\nfactor in the economic development of Illinois. The first European\r\nsettlers, who were French, came by way of the Great Lakes, and\r\nestablished intimate relations with New Orleans by the Mississippi\r\nriver. The American settlers came by way of the Ohio river, and the\r\nimmigrants from the New England and Eastern states found their way to\r\nIllinois over the Erie Canal and the Great Lakes. The first\r\ntransportation problem was to connect Lake Michigan and the Mississippi\r\nriver; this was accomplished by building the Illinois & Michigan canal\r\nto La Salle, at the head of the navigation on the Illinois river, a work\r\nwhich was begun in 1836 and completed in 1848 under the auspices of the\r\nstate. In 1890 the Sanitary District of Chicago undertook the\r\nconstruction of a canal from Chicago to Joliet, where the new canal\r\njoins the Illinois & Michigan canal; this canal is 24 ft. deep and 160\r\nft. wide. The Federal government completed in October 1907 the\r\nconstruction of a new canal, the Illinois & Mississippi, popularly\r\nknown as the Hennepin, from Hennepin to Rock river (just above the mouth\r\nof Green river), 7 ft. deep, 52 ft. wide (at bottom), and 80 ft. wide at\r\nthe water-line. This canal provides, with the Illinois & Michigan canal\r\nand the Illinois river, an improved waterway from Chicago to the\r\nMississippi river, and greatly increases the commercial and industrial\r\nimportance of the \"twin cities\" of Sterling and Rock Falls, where the\r\nRock river is dammed by a dam nearly 1500 ft. long, making the main\r\nfeeder for the canal. This feeder, formally opened in 1907, runs nearly\r\ndue S. to a point on the canal N.W. of Sheffield and N.E. of Mineral;\r\nthere are important locks on either side of this junction. At the\r\ngeneral election in November 1908 the people of Illinois authorized the\r\nissue of bonds to the amount of $20,000,000 to provide for the\r\ncanalizing of the Desplaines and Illinois rivers as far as the city of\r\nUtica, on the latter river, and connecting with the channel of the\r\nChicago Sanitary District at Joliet. The situation of Illinois between\r\nthe Great Lakes and the Appalachian Mountains has made it a natural\r\ngateway for railroads connecting the North Atlantic and the far Western\r\nstates. The first railway constructed in the West was the Northern-Cross\r\nrailroad from Meredosia on the Illinois river to Springfield, completed\r\nin 1842; during the last thirty years of the 19th century Illinois had a\r\nlarger railway mileage than any of the American states, her mileage in\r\nJanuary 1909 amounting to 12,215.63 m., second only to that of Texas. A\r\nRailway and Warehouse Commission has authority to fix freight and\r\npassenger rates for each road. It is the oldest commission with such\r\npower in the United States, and the litigation with railways which\r\nfollowed its establishment in 1871 fully demonstrated the public\r\ncharacter of the railway business and was the precedent for the policy\r\nof state control elsewhere.[3]\r\n\r\n_Population._--In 1870 and 1880 Illinois was fourth among the states of\r\nthe United States in population; but in 1890, in 1900, and in 1910, its\r\nrank was third, the figures for the last three years named being\r\nrespectively 3,826,351, 4,821,550, and 5,638,591.[4] The increase from\r\n1880 to 1890 was 24.3%; from 1890 to 1900, 26%. Of the population in\r\n1900, 98.2% was white, 79.9% was native-born, and 51.2% was of foreign\r\nparentage (either one or both parents foreign-born). The principal\r\nforeign element was German, the Teutonic immigration being especially\r\nlarge in the decade ending in 1860; the immigrants from the United\r\nKingdom were second in importance, those from the Scandinavian countries\r\nthird, and those from southern Europe fourth. The urban population, on\r\nthe basis of places having 4000 inhabitants or more, was 51% of the\r\ntotal; indeed the population of Cook county, in which the city of\r\nChicago is situated, was two-fifths of the total population of the\r\nstate; during the decade of the Civil War (1860-1870) the population of\r\nthe state increased only 48.4%, and that of Cook county about 140%,\r\nwhile from 1870 to 1900 the increase of all counties, excluding Cook,\r\nwas about 36%, the increase in Chicago was about 468%. Of the 930\r\nincorporated cities, towns and villages, 614 had less than 1000\r\ninhabitants, 27 more than 5000 and less than 10,000, 14 more than 10,000\r\nand less than 20,000, 4 more than 20,000 and less than 25,000, and 7\r\nmore than 25,000. These seven were Chicago (1,698,575), the second city\r\nin population in the United States, Peoria (56,100), Quincy (36,252),\r\nSpringfield (34,159), Rockford (31,051), East St Louis (29,655), and\r\nJoliet (29,353). In 1906 it was estimated that the total number of\r\ncommunicants of all denominations was 2,077,197, and that of this total\r\n932,084 were Roman Catholics, 263,344 were Methodist (235,092 of the\r\nNorthern Church, 7198 of the Southern Church, 9833 of the African\r\nMethodist Episcopal Church, 5512 of the Methodist Protestant Church, and\r\n3597 of the Free Methodist Church of North America), 202,566 were\r\nLutherans (113,527 of the Evangelical Lutheran Synodical Conference,\r\n36,366 of the General Council of the Evangelical Lutheran Church, 14,768\r\nof the General Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church, and 14,005 of\r\nthe Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Iowa and other states), 152,870 were\r\nBaptists (118,884 of the Northern Convention, 16,081 of the National\r\n(Colored) Baptist Convention, 7755 Free Baptists, 6671 General Baptists,\r\nand 5163 Primitive Baptists), 115,602 were Presbyterian (86,251 of the\r\nNorthern Church, 17,208 of the Cumberland Church (now a part of the\r\nNorthern Church), and 9555 of the United Presbyterian Church), 101,516\r\nwere Disciples of Christ, 50,973 were members of the German Evangelical\r\nSynod of North America, 54,875 were Congregationalists, and 36,364 were\r\nProtestant Episcopalians.\r\n\r\n_Government._--Illinois has been governed under four constitutions, a\r\nTerritorial constitution of 1812, and three State constitutions of 1818,\r\n1848 and 1870 (subsequently amended). Amendments may be made by a\r\nConstitutional Convention or a two-thirds vote of all the members\r\nelected to the legislature, ratification by the people being required in\r\neither instance. To call a Constitutional Convention it is necessary\r\nthat a majority popular vote concur in the demand therefor of two-thirds\r\nof the members of each house of the General Assembly. The executive\r\nofficials hold office for four years, with the exception of the\r\ntreasurer, whose term of service is two years. The governor must be at\r\nleast thirty years of age, and he must also have been a citizen of the\r\nUnited States and of Illinois for the five years preceding his election.\r\nHis veto may be over-ridden by a two-thirds vote of all the members\r\nelected to the legislature. Members of the legislature, which meets\r\nbiennially, are chosen by districts, three representatives and one\r\nsenator from each of the 51 districts, 18 of which are in Cook county.\r\nThe term of senators is four years, that of representatives two years;\r\nand in the election of representatives since 1870 there has been a\r\nprovision for \"minority\" representation, under which by cumulative\r\nvoting each voter may cast as many votes for one candidate as there are\r\nrepresentatives to be chosen, or he may distribute his votes (giving\r\nthree votes to one candidate, or 1½ votes each to two candidates, or one\r\nvote each to three candidates), the candidate or candidates receiving\r\nthe highest number of votes being elected. A similar system of\r\ncumulative voting for aldermen may be provided for by ordinance of\r\ncouncils in cities organized under the general state law of 1872.\r\nRequisites for membership in the General Assembly are citizenship in the\r\nUnited States; residence in Illinois for five years, two of which must\r\nhave been just preceding the candidate's election; and an age of 25\r\nyears for senators, and of 21 years for representatives. Conviction for\r\nbribery, perjury or other infamous crime, or failure (in the case of a\r\ncollector or holder of public moneys) to account for and pay over all\r\nmoneys due from him are disqualifications; and before entering upon the\r\nduties of his office each member of the legislature must take a\r\nprescribed oath that he has neither given nor promised anything to\r\ninfluence voters at the election, and that he will not accept, directly\r\nor indirectly, \"money or other valuable thing from any corporation,\r\ncompany or person\" for his vote or influence upon proposed legislation.\r\nSpecial legislation is prohibited when general laws are applicable, and\r\nspecial and local legislation is forbidden in any of twenty-three\r\nenumerated cases, among which are divorce, changing of an individual's\r\nname or the name of a place, and the grant to a corporation of the right\r\nto build railways or to exercise any exclusive franchise or privilege.\r\nThe judiciary consists of a supreme court of 7 members elected for a\r\nterm of 9 years; a circuit court of 54 judges, 3 for each of 18 judicial\r\ndistricts, elected for 6 years; and four appellate courts--one for Cook\r\ncounty (which has also a \"branch appellate court,\" both the court and\r\nthe branch court being presided over by three circuit judges appointed\r\nby the Supreme Court) and three other districts, each with three judges\r\nappointed in the same way. In Cook county a criminal court, and the\r\nsupreme court of Cook county (originally the supreme court of Chicago),\r\nsupplement the work of the circuit court. There are also county courts,\r\nconsisting of one judge who serves for four years; in some counties\r\nprobate courts have been established, and in counties of more than\r\n500,000 population juvenile courts for the trial and care of delinquent\r\nchildren are provided for.\r\n\r\nThe local government of Illinois includes both county and township\r\nsystems. The earliest American settlers came from the Southern States\r\nand naturally introduced the county system; but the increase of\r\npopulation from the New England and Middle States led to a recognition\r\nof township organization in the constitution of 1848, and this form of\r\ngovernment, at first prevalent only in the northern counties, is now\r\nfound in most of the middle and southern counties. Cook county, although\r\nit has a township system, is governed, like those counties in which\r\ntownships are not found, by a Board of Commissioners, elected by the\r\ntownships and the city of Chicago. A general law of 1872 provides for\r\nthe organization of municipalities, only cities and villages being\r\nrecognized, though there are still some \"towns\" which have failed to\r\nreorganize under the new law. City charters are granted only to such\r\nmunicipalities as have a population of at least 1000.\r\n\r\nRequirements for suffrage are age of 21 years or more, citizenship in\r\nthe United States, and residence in the state for one year, in the\r\ncounty ninety days, and the election precinct thirty days preceding the\r\nexercise of suffrage. Women are permitted to vote for certain school\r\nofficials and the trustees of the State University. Disfranchisement is\r\nbrought about by conviction for bribery, felony or infamous crime, and\r\nan attempt to vote after such conviction is a felony.\r\n\r\nThe relation of the state to corporations and industrial problems has\r\nbeen a subject of important legislation. The constitution declares that\r\nthe state's rights of eminent domain shall never be so abridged as to\r\nprevent the legislature from taking the property and franchises of\r\nincorporated companies and subjecting them to the public necessity in a\r\nway similar to the treatment of individuals. In 1903 the legislature\r\nauthorized the municipal ownership of public service corporations, and\r\nin 1905 the city of Chicago took steps to acquire ownership of its\r\nstreet railways--a movement which seemed to have spent its force in\r\n1907, when the municipal ownership candidates were defeated in the\r\ncity's elections--and in 1902 the right of that city to regulate the\r\nprice of gas was recognized by the United States Circuit Court of\r\nAppeals. Railways organized or doing business in the state are required\r\nby the constitution to have a public office where books for public\r\ninspection are kept, showing the amount of stock, its owners, and the\r\namount of the road's liabilities and assets. No railway company may now\r\nissue stock except for money, labour, or property actually received and\r\napplied to purposes for which the corporation was organized. In 1907 a\r\nlaw went into effect making two cents a mile a maximum railway fare. An\r\nanti-trust law of 1893 exempted from the definition of trust\r\ncombinations those formed by producers of agricultural products and live\r\nstock, but the United States Supreme Court in 1902 declared the statute\r\nunconstitutional as class legislation. According to a revised mining law\r\nof 1899 (subsequently amended), all mines are required to be in charge\r\nof certified mine managers, mine examiners, and hoisting engineers, when\r\nthe services of the engineers are necessary; and every mine must have an\r\nescapement shaft distinct from the hoisting shaft. The number of men\r\npermitted to work in any mine not having an escapement shaft cannot, in\r\nany circumstances, exceed ten during the time in which the escapement or\r\nconnexion is being completed.\r\n\r\nEconomic conditions have also led to an increase of administrative\r\nboards. A State Civil Service Commission was created by an act of the\r\nGeneral Assembly of 1905. A Bureau of Labor Statistics (1879), whose\r\nmembers are styled Commissioners of Labor, makes a study of economic and\r\nfinancial problems and publishes biennial reports; a Mining Board (1883)\r\nand an inspector of factories and workshops (since 1893) have for their\r\nduty the enforcement of labour legislation. There are also a State Food\r\nCommission (1899) and a Live Stock Commission (1885). A Board of\r\nArbitration (1895) has authority to make and publish investigations of\r\nall facts relating to strikes and lock-outs, to issue subpoenas for the\r\nattendance and testifying of witnesses, and \"to adjust strikes or\r\nlock-outs by mediation or conciliation, without a formal submission to\r\narbitration.\"\r\n\r\nThe employment of children under 14 years of age in factories or mines,\r\nand working employees under 16 years of age for more than 60 hours a\r\nweek, are forbidden by statute. The state has an excellent \"Juvenile\r\nCourt Law,\" which came into force on the 1st of July 1899 and has done\r\nmuch good, especially in Chicago. The law recognized that a child should\r\nnot be treated like a mature malefactor, and provided that there should\r\nbe no criminal procedure, that the child should not be imprisoned or\r\nprosecuted, that his interests should be protected by a probation\r\nofficer, that he should be discharged unless found dependent, delinquent\r\nor truant, and in such case that he should be turned over to the care of\r\nan approved individual or charitable society. This law applies to\r\ncounties having a minimum population of 500,000. The legal rate of\r\ninterest is 5%, but this may be increased to 7% by written contract. A\r\nhomestead owned and occupied by a householder having a family is exempt\r\n(to the amount of $1000) from liability for debts, except taxes upon,\r\nand purchase money for, the same. Personal property to the value of $300\r\nalso is exempt from liability for debt. Grounds for divorce are\r\nimpotence of either party at time of marriage, previous marriage,\r\nadultery, wilful desertion for two years, habitual drunkenness, attempt\r\non life, extreme and repeated cruelty, and conviction of felony or other\r\ninfamous crime. The marriage of cousins of the first degree is declared\r\nincestuous and void. In June 1907 the Supreme Court of Illinois declared\r\nthe sale of liquor not a common right and \"sale without license a\r\ncriminal offence,\" thus forcing clubs to close their bars or take out\r\nlicences.\r\n\r\n  The charitable institutions of the state are under the management of\r\n  local trustees appointed by the governor. They are under the\r\n  supervision of the Board of State Commissioners of Public Charities\r\n  (five non-salaried members appointed by the governor); in 1908 there\r\n  were 18 institutions under its jurisdiction. Of these, seven were\r\n  hospitals for the insane--six for specific parts of the state, viz.\r\n  northern at Elgin, eastern at Kankakee, central at Jacksonville,\r\n  southern at Anna, western at Watertown, and general at South\r\n  Bartonville, and one at Chester for insane criminals. The others were\r\n  the State Psychopathic Institute at Kankakee (established in 1907 as\r\n  part of the insane service) for systematic study of mental and nervous\r\n  diseases; one at Lincoln having charge of feeble-minded children; two\r\n  institutions for the blind--a school at Jacksonville and an industrial\r\n  home at Marshall Boulevard and 19th Street, Chicago; a home for\r\n  soldiers and sailors (Quincy), one for soldiers' orphans (Normal), and\r\n  one for soldiers' widows (Wilmington); a school for the deaf\r\n  (Jacksonville), and an eye and ear infirmary (Chicago). The Board of\r\n  Charities also had supervision of the State Training School for\r\n  (delinquent) Girls (1893) at Geneva, and of the St Charles School for\r\n  (delinquent) Boys (1901) at St Charles.\r\n\r\n  The trustees of each penal institution are appointed by the governor,\r\n  and the commissioners of the two penitentiaries and the managers of\r\n  the state reformatory compose a Board of Prison Industries. There were\r\n  in 1908 two penitentiaries, one at Joliet and one at Chester, and, in\r\n  addition to the two reformatory institutions for young offenders under\r\n  the supervision of the Board of Charities, there is a State\r\n  Reformatory for boys at Pontiac. The indeterminate sentence and parole\r\n  systems are important features of the treatment of criminals. All but\r\n  two of the counties have almshouses. In 1908, in some counties, the\r\n  care of paupers was still let by contract to the lowest bidder or the\r\n  superintendent was paid between $1.00 and $1.80--seldom more than\r\n  $1.50--a week for each patient, and he paid a small (or no) rent on\r\n  the county farm. Complete state control of the insane and the\r\n  introduction of modern hospital and curative treatment in the state\r\n  asylums (or hospitals) are gradually taking the place of county care\r\n  for the insane and of antiquated custodial treatment in and political\r\n  control of the state asylums--changes largely due to the action of\r\n  Governor Deneen, who appointed in 1906 a Board of Charities pledged to\r\n  reform. By a law of 1905 all employed in such institutions were put on\r\n  a civil service basis. In 1907-1908, $1,500,000 was spent in\r\n  rehabilitating old buildings and in buying new land and erecting\r\n  buildings.\r\n\r\n_Education._--Public education in Illinois had its genesis in the land\r\nof the North-West Territory reserved for educational purposes by the\r\nOrdinance of 1787. The first state school law, which provided for state\r\ntaxation for public schools, was enacted in 1825. The section providing\r\nfor taxation, however, was repealed, but free schools supported by the\r\nsale of land reserved for education and by local taxation were\r\nestablished as early as 1834. In 1855 a second school law providing for\r\na state school tax was enacted, and this is the foundation of the\r\nexisting public school system; the constitution of 1870 also requires\r\nthe legislature to provide a thorough and efficient system of public\r\nschools. In 1907-1908 the total school revenue, nine-tenths of which was\r\nderived from local taxation and the remainder chiefly from a state\r\nappropriation (for the year in question, $1,057,000) including the\r\nproceeds derived from permanent school funds secured by the gift and\r\nsale of public lands on the part of the United States Government, was\r\n$39,989,510.22. The attendance in some school of all children from 7 to\r\n16 years of age is compulsory, and of the population of school age\r\n(1,500,066) 988,078 were enrolled in public schools. The average length\r\nof the school term in 1908 was 7.8 months, and the average monthly\r\nsalary of teachers was $82.12 for men and $60.76 for women.\r\n\r\nThe state provides for higher education in the University of Illinois,\r\nsituated in the cities of Champaign and Urbana. It was founded in 1867,\r\nthrough the United States land grant of 1862, as the Illinois Industrial\r\nUniversity, and received its present name in 1885; since 1870 it has\r\nbeen co-educational. Associated with the University are the State\r\nLaboratory of Natural History, the State Water Survey, the State\r\nGeological Survey, the State Entomologist's Office, and Agricultural and\r\nEngineering Experiment Stations. The University confers degrees in arts,\r\nscience, engineering, agriculture, law, medicine, pharmacy, dentistry,\r\nmusic, and library science; besides the usual subjects, it has a course\r\nin ceramics. The University publishes _Bulletins_ of the Agricultural\r\nand Engineering Experiment Stations; _Reports_ of the State Water\r\nSurvey, of the State Natural History Survey, of the State Geological\r\nSurvey, and of the State Entomologist's Office; _University Studies_;\r\nand _The Journal of English and Germanic Philology_. The schools of\r\nmedicine, pharmacy and dentistry are in Chicago. The faculty in 1907\r\nnumbered 408, and the total enrolment of students in 1907-1908 was 4743\r\n(of whom 991 were women), distributed (with 13 duplicates in the\r\nclassification) as follows: Graduate School, 203; Undergraduate\r\nColleges, 2812; Summer Session, 367; College of Law, 186; College of\r\nMedicine, 476; College of Dentistry, 76; School of Pharmacy, 259;\r\nAcademy, 377. In 1908 the University had a library of 103,000 volumes.\r\nThe trustees of the institution, who have legislative power only, are\r\nthe governor, the President of the Board of Agriculture, the State\r\nSuperintendent of Public Instruction, and nine others elected by the\r\npeople. There were in 1907 more than forty other universities and\r\ncolleges in the state, the most important being the University of\r\nChicago, North-western University at Evanston, Illinois Wesleyan\r\nUniversity at Bloomington, Knox College, Galesburg, and Illinois College\r\nat Jacksonville. There were also six normal colleges, five of them\r\npublic: the Southern Illinois State Normal College at Carbondale, the\r\nEastern Illinois State Normal School at Charleston, the Western Illinois\r\nState Normal School at Macomb, the Chicago Normal School at Chicago, the\r\nNorthern Illinois State Normal School at DeKalb, and the Illinois State\r\nNormal University at Normal.\r\n\r\n  _Finance._--The total receipts for the biennial period ending the 30th\r\n  of September 1908 were $19,588,842.06, and the disbursements were\r\n  $21,278,805.27; and on the 1st of October 1908 there was a balance in\r\n  the treasury of $3,859,263.44. The bonded debt on the same date was\r\n  $17,500; these bonds ceased to bear interest in 1882, but although\r\n  called in by the governor they have never been presented for payment.\r\n  The system of revenue is based upon the general property tax; the\r\n  local assessment of all real and personal property is required, with\r\n  the aim of recording all kinds of property upon the assessment rolls.\r\n  Boards of Revision and Boards of Supervision then equalize the\r\n  assessments in the counties and townships, while a State Board of\r\n  Equalization seeks to equalize the total valuation of the various\r\n  counties. The tendency is for property valuations to decline, the\r\n  estimated valuation from 1873 to 1893 decreasing 27% in Cook county\r\n  and 39% in the other counties, while the assessments from 1888 to 1898\r\n  were in inverse ratio to the increase of wealth. There has also been\r\n  great inequality in valuations, the increase of valuation in Cook\r\n  county made in compliance with the revenue law of 1898 being\r\n  $200,000,000, while that for the rest of the state was only\r\n  $4,000,000. Among other sources of revenue are an inheritance tax,\r\n  which yields approximately $1,000,000 a year, and 7% of the annual\r\n  gross earnings of the Illinois Central railway, given in return for\r\n  the state aid in the construction of the road. The constitution\r\n  prohibits the state from lending its credit or making appropriations\r\n  in aid of any corporation, association or individual, and from\r\n  constructing internal improvements, and the counties, townships, and\r\n  other political units cannot incur indebtedness in excess of 5% of\r\n  their assessed property valuation. The legislature may not contract a\r\n  debt of more than $250,000 except to suppress treason, war or\r\n  invasion, and no legislative appropriation may extend longer than the\r\n  succeeding legislature. General banking laws must be submitted to the\r\n  people for ratification.\r\n\r\n_History._--Illinois is the French form of Iliniwek, the name of a\r\nconfederacy of Algonquian tribes. The first exploration by Europeans was\r\nthat of the French. In 1659 Pierre Radisson and Medard Chouart des\r\nGroseilliers seem to have reached the upper Mississippi. It is certain\r\nthat in 1673 part of the region known as the Illinois country was\r\nexplored to some extent by two Frenchmen, Louis Joliet and Jacques\r\nMarquette, a Jesuit father. Marquette, under orders to begin a mission\r\nto the Indians, who were known to the French by their visits to the\r\nFrench settlements in the Lake Superior region, and Joliet, who acted\r\nunder orders of Jean Talon, Intendant of Canada, ascended the Fox river,\r\ncrossed the portage between it and the Wisconsin river, and followed\r\nthat stream to the Mississippi, which they descended to a point below\r\nthe mouth of the Arkansas. On their return journey they ascended the\r\nIllinois river as far as Lake Peoria; they then crossed the portage to\r\nLake Michigan, and in 1675 Marquette founded a mission at the Indian\r\ntown of Kaskaskia, near the present Utica, Ill. In 1679 the explorer La\r\nSalle, desiring to find the mouth of the Mississippi and to extend the\r\ndomain of France in America, ascended the St Joseph river, crossed the\r\nportage separating it from the Kankakee, which he descended to the\r\nIllinois, and built in the neighbourhood of Lake Peoria a fort which he\r\ncalled Fort Crevecoeur. The vicissitudes of the expedition, the\r\nnecessity for him to return to Canada for tools to construct a large\r\nriver-boat, and opposition in Canada to his plans, prevented him from\r\nreaching the mouth of the Illinois until the 6th of February 1682. After\r\nsuch preliminary explorations, the French made permanent settlements,\r\nwhich had their origin in the missions of the Jesuits and the bartering\r\nposts of the French traders. Chief of these were Kaskaskia, established\r\nnear the mouth of the Kaskaskia river, about 1720; Cahokia, a little\r\nbelow the mouth of the Missouri river, founded at about the same time;\r\nand Fort Chartres, on the Mississippi between Cahokia and Kaskaskia,\r\nfounded in 1720 to be a link in a chain of fortifications intended to\r\nextend from the St Lawrence to the Gulf of Mexico. A monument of the\r\nlabours of the missionaries is a manuscript dictionary (c. 1720) of the\r\nlanguage of the Illinois, with catechism and prayers, probably the work\r\nof Father Le Boulanger.\r\n\r\nIn 1712 the Illinois river was made the N. boundary of the French\r\nprovince of Louisiana, which was granted to Antoine Crozat (1655-1738),\r\nand in 1721 the seventh civil and military district of that province was\r\nnamed Illinois, which included more than one-half of the present state,\r\nthe country between the Arkansas river and the line 43° N. lat., as well\r\nas the country between the Rocky Mountains and the Mississippi; but in\r\n1723 the region around the Wabash river was formed into a separate\r\ndistrict. The trade of the Illinois country was now diverted to the\r\nsettlements in the lower Mississippi river, but the French, although\r\nthey were successful in gaining the confidence and friendship of the\r\nIndians, failed to develop the resources of the country. By the treaty\r\nof Paris, 1763, France ceded to Great Britain her claims to the country\r\nbetween the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, but on account of the\r\nresistance of Pontiac, a chief of the Ottawas who drew into conspiracy\r\nmost of the tribes between the Ottawa river and the lower Mississippi,\r\nthe English were not able to take possession of the country until 1765,\r\nwhen the French flag was finally lowered at Fort Chartres.\r\n\r\nThe policy of the British government was not favourable to the economic\r\ndevelopment of the newly-acquired country, since it was feared that its\r\nprosperity might react against the trade and industry of Great Britain.\r\nBut in 1769 and the succeeding years of English control, this policy was\r\nrelaxed, and immigration from the seaboard colonies, especially from\r\nVirginia, began. In 1771 the people of the Illinois country, through a\r\nmeeting at Kaskaskia, demanded a form of self-government similar to that\r\nof Connecticut. The petition was rejected by General Thomas Gage; and\r\nThomas Legge, earl of Dartmouth (1731-1801), Secretary of State for\r\nPlantations and President of the Board of Trade, drew up a plan of\r\ngovernment for Illinois in which all officials were appointed by the\r\ncrown. This, however, was never operative, for in 1774, by the famous\r\nQuebec Act, the Illinois country was annexed to the province of Quebec,\r\nand at the same time the jurisdiction of the French civil law was\r\nrecognized. These facts explain the considerable sympathy in Illinois\r\nfor the colonial cause in the War of Independence. Most of the\r\ninhabitants, however, were French, and these were Loyalists.\r\nConsequently, the British government withdrew their troops from the\r\nIllinois country. The English authorities instigated the Indians to make\r\nattacks upon the frontiers of the American colonies, and this led to one\r\nof the most important events in the history of the Illinois country, the\r\ncapture of the British posts of Cahokia and Kaskaskia in 1778, and in\r\nthe following year of Vincennes (Indiana), by George Rogers Clark\r\n(q.v.), who acted under orders of Patrick Henry, Governor of Virginia.\r\nThese conquests had much to do with the securing by the United States of\r\nthe country W. of the Alleghanies and N. of the Ohio in the treaty of\r\nParis, 1783.\r\n\r\nThe Virginia House of Delegates, in 1778, extended the civil\r\njurisdiction of Virginia to the north-west, and appointed Captain John\r\nTodd (1750-1782), of Kentucky, governor of the entire territory north of\r\nthe Ohio, organized as \"The County of Illinois\"; the judges of the\r\ncourts at Cahokia, Kaskaskia, and Vincennes, who had been appointed\r\nunder the British administration, were now chosen by election; but this\r\ngovernment was confined to the old French settlements and was entirely\r\ninefficient. In 1787, Virginia and the other states having relinquished\r\ntheir claims to the country west of the Alleghanies, the North-West\r\nTerritory was organized by Congress by the famous Ordinance of 1787. Two\r\nyears later St Clair county was formed out of the S.W. part of the\r\nIllinois country, while the E. portion and the settlements around\r\nVincennes (Indiana) were united into the county of Knox, and in 1795 the\r\nS. part of St Clair county was organized into Randolph county, with\r\nKaskaskia as the seat of administration. In 1800 the Illinois country\r\nwas included in the Territory of Indiana, and in 1809 the W. part of\r\nIndiana from Vincennes N. to Canada was organized as the Territory of\r\nIllinois; it included, besides the present territory of the state, all\r\nof Wisconsin except the N. part of the Green Bay peninsula, a\r\nconsiderable part of Michigan, and all of Minnesota E. of the\r\nMississippi. In 1812, by permission of Congress, a representative\r\nassembly was chosen, a Territorial constitution was adopted, and the\r\nTerritorial delegate in Congress was elected directly by the people.\r\n\r\nIn 1818 Illinois became a state of the American Union, the Enabling Act\r\nfixing the line 42° 30' as the N. boundary, instead of that provided by\r\nthe Ordinance of 1787, which passed through the S. bend of Lake\r\nMichigan. The reason given for this change was that if the Mississippi\r\nand Ohio rivers were the only outlets of Illinois trade, the interests\r\nof the state would become identified with those of the southern states;\r\nbut if an outlet by Lake Michigan were provided, closer relations would\r\nbe established with the northern and middle states, and so \"additional\r\nsecurity for the perpetuity of the Union\" would be afforded.\r\n\r\nAmong the first problems of the new state were those relating to lands\r\nand Indians. Throughout the Territorial period there was conflict\r\nbetween French and English land claims. In 1804 Congress established\r\nland offices at Kaskaskia and Vincennes to examine existing claims and\r\nto eliminate conflict with future grants; in 1812 new offices were\r\nestablished at Shawneetown and Edwardsville for the sale of public\r\nlands; and in 1816 more than 500,000 acres were sold. In 1818, however,\r\nmany citizens were in debt for their lands, and \"squatters\" invaded the\r\nrights of settlers. Congress therefore reduced the price of land from $2\r\nto $1.25 per acre, and adopted the policy of pre-emption, preference\r\nbeing given to the claims of existing settlers. The Indians, however,\r\nresisted measures looking toward the extinguishment of their claims to\r\nthe country. Their dissatisfaction with the treaties signed in 1795 and\r\n1804 caused them to espouse the British cause in the War of 1812, and in\r\n1812 they overpowered a body of soldiers and settlers who had abandoned\r\nFort Dearborn (See CHICAGO). For a number of years after the end of the\r\nconflict, the Indians were comparatively peaceful; but in 1831 the delay\r\nof the Sauk and Foxes in withdrawing from the lands in northern\r\nIllinois, caused Governor John Reynolds (1788-1865) to call out the\r\nmilitia. The following year Black Hawk, a Sauk leader, opened an\r\nunsuccessful war in northern Illinois and Wisconsin (the Black Hawk\r\nWar); and by 1833 all Indians in Illinois had been removed from the\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nThe financial and industrial policy of the state was unfortunate. Money\r\nbeing scarce, the legislature in 1819 chartered a state bank which was\r\nauthorized to do business on the credit of the state. In a few years the\r\nbank failed, and the state in 1831 borrowed money to redeem the\r\ndepreciated notes issued by the bank. A second state bank was chartered\r\nin 1835; two years later it suspended payment, and in 1843 the\r\nlegislature provided for its liquidation. The state also undertook to\r\nestablish a system of internal improvements, granting a loan for the\r\nconstruction of the Illinois and Michigan canal in 1836, and in 1837\r\nappropriating $10,000,000 for the building of railroads and other\r\nimprovements. The experiment proved unsuccessful; the state's credit\r\ndeclined and a heavy debt was incurred, and in 1840 the policy of aiding\r\npublic improvements was abandoned. Through the efforts of Governor\r\nThomas Ford (1800-1850) a movement to repudiate the state debt was\r\ndefeated, and a plan was adopted by which the entire debt could be\r\nreduced without excessive taxation, and by 1880 practically the entire\r\ndebt was extinguished.\r\n\r\nA notable incident in the history of the state was the immigration of\r\nthe Mormons from Missouri, about 1840. Their principal settlements were\r\nin Hancock county. They succeeded in securing favours from the\r\nlegislature, and their city of Nauvoo had courts and a military\r\norganization that was independent of state control. Political intrigue,\r\nclaims of independence from the state, as well as charges of polygamy\r\nand lawless conduct, aroused such intense opposition to the sect that in\r\n1844 a civil war broke out in Hancock county which resulted in the\r\nmurder of Joseph Smith and the removal of the Mormons from Illinois in\r\n1846.\r\n\r\nThe slavery question, however, was the problem of lasting political\r\nimportance. Slaves had been brought into the Illinois country by the\r\nFrench, and Governor Arthur St Clair (1734-1818) interpreted the article\r\nof the Ordinance of 1787, which forbade slavery in the North-West\r\nTerritory, as a prohibition of the introduction of slaves into the\r\nTerritory, not an interference with existing conditions. The idea also\r\narose that while negroes could not become slaves, they could be held as\r\nindentured servants, and such servitude was recognized in the Indiana\r\nCode of 1803, the Illinois constitution of 1818, and Statutes of 1819;\r\nindeed there would probably have been a recognition of slavery in the\r\nconstitution of 1818 had it not been feared that such recognition would\r\nhave prevented the admission of the state to the Union. In 1823 the\r\nlegislature referred to the people a resolution for a constitutional\r\nconvention to amend the constitution. The aim, not expressed, was the\r\nlegalization of slavery. Although a majority of the public men of the\r\nstate, indeed probably a majority of the entire population, was either\r\nborn in the Southern states or descended from Southern people, the\r\nresolution of the legislature was rejected, the leader of the opposition\r\nbeing Governor Edward Coles (1786-1868), a Virginia slave-holder, who\r\nhad freed his slaves on coming to Illinois, and at least one half the\r\nvotes against the proposed amendment of the constitution were cast by\r\nmen of Southern birth. The opposition to slavery, however, was at first\r\neconomic, not philanthropic. In 1837 there was only one abolition\r\nsociety in the state, but chiefly through the agitation of Elijah P.\r\nLovejoy (see ALTON), the abolition sentiment grew. In 1842 the moral\r\nissue had become political, and the Liberty Party was organized, which\r\nin 1848 united with the Free Soil Party; but as the Whig Party approved\r\nthe policy of non-extension of slavery, these parties did not succeed so\r\nwell united as under separate existence. In 1854, however, the Liberty\r\nand Free Soil parties, the Democrats opposed to the Kansas-Nebraska\r\nBill, and some Whigs united, secured a majority in the legislature, and\r\nelected Lyman Trumbull United States senator. Two years later these\r\nelements formally organized as the Republican Party, though that name\r\nhad been used locally in 1854, and elected their candidates for state\r\noffices. This was the first time that the Democratic Party had been\r\ndefeated, its organization having been in control since the admission of\r\nIllinois to the Union. An important influence in this political\r\nrevolution was a change in the character of the population. Until 1848\r\nthe Southern element predominated in the population, but after that year\r\nthe immigration from the Northern states was greater than that from the\r\nSouth, and the foreign element also increased.[5] The opposition to\r\nslavery continued to be political and economic rather than\r\nphilanthropic. The constitution of 1848, which abolished slavery, also\r\nforbade the immigration of slaves into the state.[6] In 1858 occurred\r\nthe famous contest for the office of United States senator between\r\nStephen A. Douglas (Democrat) and Abraham Lincoln (Republican). Douglas\r\nwas elected, but the vote showed that Illinois was becoming more\r\nNorthern in sympathy, and two years later Lincoln, then candidate for\r\nthe presidency, carried the state.\r\n\r\nThe policy of Illinois in the early period of secession was one of\r\nmarked loyalty to the Union; even in the S. part of the state, where\r\nthere was a strong feeling against national interference with slavery,\r\nthe majority of the people had no sympathy with the pro-slavery men in\r\ntheir efforts to dissolve the Union. The legislature of 1861 provided\r\nfor a war fund of $2,000,000; and Capt. James H. Stokes (1814-1890) of\r\nChicago transferred a large amount of munitions of war from St Louis,\r\nwhere the secession sentiment was strong, to Alton. The state\r\ncontributed 255,092 men to the Federal armies. From 1862-1864, however,\r\nthere was considerable opposition to a continuance of the war. This was\r\nat first political; the legislature of 1862 was Democratic, and for\r\npolitical purposes that body adopted resolutions against further\r\nconflict, and recommended an armistice, and a national convention to\r\nconclude peace. The same year a convention, whose duty was to revise the\r\nconstitution, met. It declared that the law which called it into being\r\nwas no longer binding, and that it was supreme in all matters incident\r\nto amending the constitution. Among its acts was the assumption of the\r\nright of ratifying a proposed amendment to the constitution of the\r\nUnited States which prohibited Congress from interfering with the\r\ninstitution of slavery within a state, although the right of\r\nratification belonged to the legislature. The convention also inserted\r\nclauses preventing negroes and mulattoes from immigrating into the state\r\nand from voting and holding office; and although the constitution as a\r\nwhole was rejected by the people, these clauses were ratified. In 1863\r\nmore pronounced opposition to the policy of the National Government\r\ndeveloped. A mass meeting, which met at Springfield in July, at the\r\ninstance of the Democratic Party, adopted resolutions that condemned\r\nthe suspension of the writ of Habeas Corpus, endorsed the doctrine of\r\nstate sovereignty, demanded a national assembly to determine terms of\r\npeace, and asked President Lincoln to withdraw the proclamation that\r\nemancipated the slaves, and so to permit the people of Illinois to fight\r\nonly for \"Union, the Constitution and the enforcement of the laws.\" The\r\nKnights of the Golden Circle, and other secret societies, whose aims\r\nwere the promulgation of state sovereignty and the extension of aid to\r\nthe Confederate states, began to flourish, and it is said that in 1864\r\nthere were 50,000 members of the Sons of Liberty in the state. Captain\r\nT. Henry Hines, of the Confederate army, was appointed by Jefferson\r\nDavis to co-operate with these societies. For a time his headquarters\r\nwere in Chicago, and an elaborate attempt to liberate Confederate\r\nprisoners in Chicago (known as the Camp Douglas Conspiracy) was thwarted\r\nby a discovery of the plans. In the elections of 1864 the Republicans\r\nand Union Democrats united, and after an exciting campaign they were\r\nsuccessful. The new legislature was the first among the legislatures of\r\nthe states to ratify (on the 1st of February 1865) the Thirteenth\r\nAmendment.\r\n\r\nFrom the close of the Civil War until the end of the 19th century the\r\nRepublican Party was generally dominant, but the trend of political\r\ndevelopment was not without interest. In 1872 many prominent men of the\r\nstate joined the Liberal Republican Party, among them Governor John M.\r\nPalmer, Senator Lyman Trumbull and Gustavus Koerner (1809-1896), one of\r\nthe most prominent representatives of the German element in Illinois.\r\nThe organization united locally, as in national politics, with the\r\nDemocratic Party, with equally ineffective results. Economic depression\r\ngave the Granger Movement considerable popularity, and an outgrowth of\r\nthe Granger organization was the Independent Reform Party, of 1874,\r\nwhich advocated retrenchment of expenses, the state regulation of\r\nrailways and a tariff for revenue only. A Democratic Liberal Party was\r\norganized in the same year, one of its leaders being Governor Palmer;\r\nconsequently no party had a majority in the legislature elected in 1874.\r\nIn 1876 the Greenback Party, the successor in Illinois of the\r\nIndependent Reform Party, secured a strong following; although its\r\ncandidate for governor was endorsed by the Democrats, the Republicans\r\nregained control of the state administration.\r\n\r\nThe relations between capital and labour have resulted in serious\r\nconditions, the number of strikes from 1880-1901 having been 2640, and\r\nthe number of lock-outs 95. In 1885 the governor found it necessary to\r\nuse the state militia to suppress riots in Will and Cook counties\r\noccasioned by the strikes of quarrymen, and the following year the\r\nmilitia was again called out to suppress riots in St Clair and Cook\r\ncounties caused by the widespread strike of railway employees. The most\r\nnoted instance of military interference was in 1894, when President\r\nGrover Cleveland sent United States troops to Chicago to prevent\r\nstrikers and rioters from interfering with the transmission of the\r\nUnited States mails.\r\n\r\nMunicipal problems have also reacted upon state politics. From 1897 to\r\n1903 the efforts of the Street Railway Companies of Chicago to extend\r\ntheir franchise, and of the city of Chicago to secure municipal control\r\nof its street railway system, resulted in the statute of 1903, which\r\nprovided for municipal ownership. But the proposed issue under this law\r\nof bonds with which Chicago was to purchase or construct railways would\r\nhave increased the city's bonded indebtedness beyond its constitutional\r\nlimit, and was therefore declared unconstitutional in April 1907 by the\r\nsupreme court of the state.\r\n\r\nA law of 1901 provided for a system of initiative whereby any question\r\nof public policy might be submitted to popular vote upon the signature\r\nof a written petition therefor by one-tenth of the registered voters of\r\nthe state; such a petition must be filed at least 60 days before the\r\nelection day when it is to be voted upon, and not more than three\r\nquestions by initiative may be voted on at the same election; to become\r\noperative a measure must receive a majority of all votes cast in the\r\nelection. Under this act, in 1902, there was a favourable vote (451,319\r\nto 76,975) for the adoption of measures requisite to securing the\r\nelection of United States senators by popular and direct vote, and in\r\n1903 the legislature of the state (which in 1891 had asked Congress to\r\nsubmit such an amendment) adopted a joint resolution asking Congress to\r\ncall a convention to propose such an amendment to the Federal\r\nConstitution; in 1904 there was a majority of all the votes cast in the\r\nelection for an amendment to the primary laws providing that voters may\r\nvote at state primaries under the Australian ballot. The direct primary\r\nlaw, however, which was passed immediately afterwards by the\r\nlegislature, was declared unconstitutional by the supreme court of the\r\nstate, as were a second law of the same sort passed soon afterwards and\r\na third law of 1908, which provided for direct nominations of all\r\nofficers and an \"advisory\" nomination of United States senators.\r\n\r\nAMERICAN GOVERNORS OF ILLINOIS\r\n\r\n  _Territorial._\r\n\r\n  Ninian Edwards              1809-1818\r\n\r\n  _State._\r\n\r\n  Shadrach Bond               1818-1822 Democrat\r\n  Edward Coles                1822-1826     \"\r\n  Ninian Edwards              1826-1830     \"\r\n  John Reynolds               1830-1834     \"\r\n  Wm.

(New York, 1902), and the chapters of E. B.\r\n  Greene's _The Government of Illinois_ (New York, 1904) contain useful\r\n  lists of documents, monographs and books. Physiography is well\r\n  described in _The Illinois Glacial Lobe_ (U.S. Geological Survey,\r\n  Monograph, xxxviii.) and _The Water Resources of Illinois_ (U.S.\r\n  Geological Survey, Annual Report, xviii.). The Illinois State\r\n  Laboratory of Natural History, connected with the State University,\r\n  has published S. A. Forbes and R. E. Richardson's _Fishes of Illinois_\r\n  (Urbana, 1909). Information concerning economic conditions may be\r\n  derived from the volumes of the _Twelfth Census of the United States_,\r\n  which treat of Agriculture, Manufactures and Mines and Quarries: a\r\n  summary of agricultural conditions may be found in _Census Bulletin\r\n  No. 213_. Constitutional and administrative problems are discussed in\r\n  Elliott Anthony's _Constitutional History of Illinois_; Greene's _The\r\n  Government of Illinois_, and H. P. Judson's _The Government of\r\n  Illinois_ (New York, 1900). Among the reports of the state officials,\r\n  those of the Railroad and Ware House Commission, of the Bureau of\r\n  Labor Statistics, and of the Commissioners of Charity are especially\r\n  valuable. There is an historical study of the problem of taxation,\r\n  entitled, \"History of the Struggle in Illinois to realize Equality in\r\n  Taxation,\" by H. B. Hurd, in the _Publications of the Michigan\r\n  Political Science Association_ (1901). Local government is described\r\n  by Albert Shaw, _Local Government in Illinois_ (Johns Hopkins\r\n  University Studies, vol. i. No. 10). The _Blue Book of the State of\r\n  Illinois_ (Springfield, 1903); H. B. Hurd's Revised Statutes of\r\n  Illinois (Chicago, 1903), and Starr and Curtis, _Annotated Statutes of\r\n  the State of Illinois_ (Chicago, 1896), are also of value.\r\n\r\n  The standard histories of the state are J. Moses, _Illinois,\r\n  Historical and Statistical_ (2 vols., Chicago, 1889); and H. Davidson\r\n  and B. Stuvé, _Complete History of Illinois_ (Springfield, 1874).\r\n  Edward G. Mason's _Chapters from Illinois History_ (Chicago, 1901) is\r\n  of interest for the French explorations and the colonial period. C.\r\n  E. Boyd in \"The County of Illinois\" (_American Hist.

Smith in _The St Clair Papers_ (Cincinnati, 1882), and the\r\n  _Territorial Records of Illinois_ (\"Publications of the State\r\n  Historical Library,\" No. 3) are important for the period until 1818.\r\n  Governor Thomas Ford's _History of Illinois_ (Chicago, 1854), and\r\n  Governor John Reynolds's _My Own Times_ (1855), are contemporary\r\n  sources for 1818-1846; they should be supplemented by N. W. Edwards's\r\n  _History of Illinois (1778-1833)_ and _Life of Ninian Edwards_\r\n  (Springfield, 1870), E. B. Washburne's _Edwards Papers_ (Chicago,\r\n  1884), C. H. Garnett's _State Banks of Issue in Illinois_ (Univ. of\r\n  Ill., 1898), and N. G. Harris's _History of Negro Servitude in\r\n  Illinois_ (Chicago, 1904). C. E. Carr's _The Illini_ (Chicago, 1904)\r\n  is a study of conditions in Illinois from 1850-1860. W. W. Lusk's\r\n  _Politics and Politicians of Illinois, the Illinois Constitutional\r\n  Convention_ (1862), _the Granger Movement in Illinois_, and _Illinois\r\n  Railway Legislation and Common Control_ (University of Illinois\r\n  Studies), _Street Railway Legislation in Illinois_ (_Atlantic\r\n  Monthly_, vol. xciii.), are of value for conditions after 1860. The\r\n  publications of the Chicago Historical Society, of the \"Fergus\r\n  Historical\" series, of the State Historical Library, of the Wisconsin\r\n  Historical Society, also the Michigan Pioneer Collections, contain\r\n  valuable documents and essays.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [1] The statistics for years prior to 1900 are taken from reports of\r\n    the U.S. Census, those for years after 1900 from the _Year Books_ of\r\n    the U.S. Department of Agriculture. It should be borne in mind that\r\n    in census years, when comparison can be made, the two sets of\r\n    statistics often vary considerably.\r\n\r\n  [2] According to the report of the State Geological Survey, the value\r\n    of the total mineral product in the state for 1907 was $152,122,648,\r\n    the values of the different minerals being as follows: coal,\r\n    $54,687,382; pig iron, about $52,228,000; petroleum, $16,432,947;\r\n    clay and clay products, $13,351,362; zinc, $6,614,608; limestone,\r\n    $4,333,651; Portland cement, $2,632,576; sand and gravel, $1,367,653;\r\n    natural slag, $174,282; fluorspar, $141,971; mineral waters, $91,700;\r\n    lead ore, $45,760; sandstone, $14,996; and pyrite, $5700.\r\n\r\n  [3] See the so-called _McLean County Case_ (67 Ill. 11), the _Neal\r\n    Ruggles Case_ (91 Ill. 256), _The People_ v. _The Illinois Central\r\n    Railroad Co._ (95 Ill. 313), and _Munn_ v. _Ill._ (94 U.S. 113).\r\n\r\n  [4] The populations in other census years were: (1810), 12,282;\r\n    (1820), 55,211; (1830), 157,445; (1840), 476,183; (1850), 851,470;\r\n    (1860), 1,711,951; (1870), 2,539,891; (1880), 3,077,871.\r\n\r\n  [5] The influence of immigration and sectionalism upon Illinois\r\n    politics is well illustrated by the fact that the first six governors\r\n    (1818-1838) were born in the Southern states, six of the eight United\r\n    States senators of that period were also Southern born, and all of\r\n    the representatives, with one exception, also came to Illinois from\r\n    the Southern states. After 1838 the Eastern states began to be\r\n    represented among the governors, but until 1901 no governor was\r\n    elected who was a native of Illinois. See E. B. Greene, _Sectional\r\n    Forces in the History of Illinois_ (Publications of the Historical\r\n    Library of Illinois, No. 8, 1903).\r\n\r\n  [6] In the slavery issue of 1848 the sentiment for abolition centred\r\n    in the northern counties, the opposition in the southern.\r\n\r\n  [7] Mr French's service of seven years is due to the fact that the\r\n    Constitutional Convention of 1848 ordered a new election of state\r\n    officials. French was re-elected Governor, beginning his new term in\r\n    1849.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nILLORIN, a province of British West Africa in the protectorate of\r\nNigeria. It has an area of 6300 m., with an estimated population of\r\nabout 250,000. Its inhabitants are of various tribes, among which the\r\nYoruba now predominate. There are two minor emirates, Shonga and Lafiagi\r\nin this province, and a number of semi-independent towns of which the\r\nchief are Awton, Ajassa, Offa and Patiji. Under British administration\r\nthe province is divided into three divisions, Illorin (central), Offa\r\n(southern) and Patiji (northern). The province is rich in agricultural\r\nand sylvan products. Among the former are tobacco, cotton, rice,\r\npeppers, ground-nuts and kolas. The latter include great quantities of\r\nshea as well as palm-oil and rubber. The capital is a town of the same\r\nname as the province. It is 160 m. in a direct line N.N.E. of Lagos, and\r\n50 m. S.S.W. of Jebba, a port on the Niger, being connected with both\r\nplaces by railway. The town is surrounded by a mud wall partly in ruins,\r\nwhich has a circuit of some 10 m. Illorin is a great trading centre,\r\nHausa caravans bringing goods from central Africa, and merchandise from\r\nthe coasts of the Mediterranean, which is distributed from Illorin to\r\nDahomey, Benin and the Lagos hinterland, while from the Guinea coast the\r\ntrade is in the hands of the Yoruba and comes chiefly through Lagos. A\r\nvariety of manufactures are carried on, including the making of leather\r\ngoods, carved wooden vessels, finely plaited mats, embroidered work,\r\nshoes of yellow and red leather and pottery of various kinds. Before the\r\nestablishment of British administration traders from the south, with a\r\nfew selected exceptions, were prohibited from entering the city. Illorin\r\nmiddlemen transacted all business between the traders from the north,\r\nwho were not allowed to pass to the south, and those from the south.\r\nSince the establishment of British authority the town has been thrown\r\nopen, crowds of petty traders from Lagos have flocked into Illorin, and\r\nbetween 4000 and 5000 trade licences are issued yearly. The British\r\nresident estimated in 1904 that at least 3000 loads of British cotton\r\ngoods, which he valued at £5 a load, were imported. The population of\r\nthe town is estimated at from 60,000 to 70,000. The chief buildings are\r\nthe palace of the emir and the houses of the _baloguns_ (war chiefs).\r\nFrom the centre of the town roads radiate like spokes of a wheel to the\r\nvarious gates. Baobabs and other shade trees are numerous. There are a\r\nnumber of mosques in the town, and the Mahommedans are the dominant\r\npower, but the Yoruba, who constitute the bulk of the people, are\r\npagans.\r\n\r\nThe town of Illorin was founded, towards the close of the 18th century,\r\nby Yoruba, and rose to be the capital of one of the Yoruba kingdoms.\r\nAbout 1825 the kingdom, which had come under Mahommedan influence,\r\nceased its connexion with the Yoruba states and became an emirate of the\r\nSokoto empire. The Fula, however, maintained the Yoruba system of\r\ngovernment, which places the chief power in a council of elders. In\r\n1897 Illorin was occupied by the forces of the Royal Niger Company, and\r\nthe emir placed himself \"entirely under the protection and power of the\r\ncompany.\" After the assumption of authority by the British government in\r\n1900, Illorin was organized for administration on the same system as the\r\nremainder of northern Nigeria. The emir took the oath of allegiance to\r\nthe sovereign of Great Britain. A resident was placed at his court.\r\nCourts of justice have been established and British garrisons quartered\r\nat various places in the province. (See also NIGERIA and LAGOS.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nILLUMINATED MSS.--\"Illumination,\" in art, is a term used to signify the\r\nembellishment of written or printed text or design with colours and\r\ngold, rarely also with silver. The old form of the verb \"to illuminate\"\r\nwas \"to enlumine\" (O. Fr. _enluminer_; Lat. _illuminare_, \"to throw\r\nlight on,\" \"to brighten\"), as used by Chaucer (_A.B.C._, 73), \"kalendres\r\nenlumyned ben they,\" and other medieval writers. Joinville likens the\r\naction of St Louis in adorning his kingdom with monastic foundations to\r\na writer \"qui a fait son livre qui l'enlumine d'or et d'azur\"; while\r\nDante (_Purgat._ xi. 79) alludes to this kind of decoration as \"quell'\r\narte che alluminare chiamata è in Parisi.\" But while the term should be\r\nstrictly applied to the brilliant book-ornamentation which was developed\r\nin the later middle ages, it has been extended, by usage, to the\r\nillustration and decoration of early MSS. in general.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Early.\r\n\r\nFrom remote times the practice of illustrating texts by means of\r\npictorial representations was in vogue. The survival of papyrus rolls\r\ncontaining the text of the Egyptian ritual known as _The Book of the\r\nDead_, dating back fifteen centuries B.C., and accompanied with numerous\r\nscenes painted in brilliant colours, proves how ancient was this very\r\nnatural method of elucidating a written text by means of pictures. There\r\nare many passages in the writings of Latin authors showing that\r\nillustrated books were not uncommon in Rome at least in the early period\r\nof the empire; and the oldest extant paintings in ancient classical MSS.\r\nmay with little hesitation be accepted as representative of the style of\r\nillustration which was practised very much earlier. But such paintings\r\nare rather illustrative than decorative, and the only strictly\r\nornamental adjuncts are the frames in which they are set. Yet\r\nindependent decoration appears in a primitive form in the papyri and the\r\nearliest vellum MSS. At the head or at the end of the text designs\r\ncomposed of cross-hatchings, cables, dotted patterns and scrolls,\r\nsometimes with birds or simple domestic objects, are found. The early\r\npractice of writing the initial lines or even the entire text of a\r\nvolume in gold or coloured inks, and of staining with purple and of\r\ngilding the vellum, while it undoubtedly enhanced the decorative aspect,\r\ndoes not properly fall within the scope of this article; it concerns the\r\nmaterial rather than the artistic element of the MS. (See MANUSCRIPTS,\r\nPALAEOGRAPHY.)\r\n\r\nIt will be seen, then, that in the earliest examples of book decorations\r\nwe find the germs of the two lines on which that decoration was destined\r\nto develop in the illuminated MSS. of the middle ages: the illustrative\r\npicture was the precursor of the medieval miniature (the technical term\r\nfor a picture in an illuminated MS.); and the independent simple\r\nornament was to expand into the brilliant initial letters and borders of\r\nillumination. And yet, while the miniature has a career of its own in\r\nartistic development which may be more conveniently dealt with under a\r\nseparate heading (see MINIATURE), its decorative qualities are so\r\nclosely bound up with those of the initial and border that an historical\r\ndescription of illumination must give full recognition to its prominent\r\nposition in the general scheme of book-ornamentation of the middle ages.\r\n\r\nThe first examples to come under consideration are the few surviving\r\nMSS. of early origin which, preserving as they do the classical\r\ntradition, form the connecting link between the art of the Roman empire\r\nand that of the middle ages. The most ancient of these, it is now\r\nagreed, is the fragmentary copy of the _Iliad_, on vellum, in the\r\nAmbrosian Library of Milan, which consists of cuttings of the coloured\r\ndrawings with which the volume was adorned in illustration of the\r\nvarious scenes of the poem. The MS. may have been executed in Italy,\r\nand there is good reason to assign the fragments to the 3rd century. The\r\ncharacter of the art is quite classical, bearing comparison with that of\r\nthe wall-paintings of Pompeii and the catacombs. Equally classical in\r\ntheir style are the fifty illustrative pictures of the Vatican Virgil,\r\nknown as the _Schedae Vaticanae_, of the 4th century; but in these we\r\nfind an advance on the Homeric fragments in the direction of decoration,\r\nfor gilt shading is here employed to heighten the lights, and the frames\r\nin which the pictures are set are ornamented with gilt lozenges. A\r\nsecond famous MS. of Virgil in the Vatican library is the _Codex\r\nRomanus_, a curious instance of rough and clumsy art, with its series of\r\nillustrations copied by an unskilful hand from earlier classical models.\r\nAnd a still later example of persistence of the classical tradition is\r\nseen in the long roll of the book of Joshua, also in the Vatican,\r\nperhaps of the 10th century, which is filled with a series of outline\r\ndrawings of considerable merit, copied from an earlier MS. But all such\r\nMSS. exhibit little tendency to decoration, and if the book\r\nornamentation of the early middle ages had been practised only in the\r\nwestern empire and not also at Constantinople, it is very doubtful if\r\nthe brilliant illumination which was afterwards developed would have\r\never existed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE I.\r\n\r\n  THE LINDISFARNE GOSPELS.--ABOUT A.D. 700.\r\n\r\n  (British Museum. Cotton MS., Nero D. iv. f. 211.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n  Byzantine.\r\n\r\nWhen the centre of government passed eastward, Roman art came under\r\nOriental influence with its sense of splendour, and developed the style\r\nknown as Byzantine which, in its earlier stages, and until it became\r\nstereotyped in character, was broad in its drawing, on classical lines,\r\nand brilliant in its colouring, and which introduced a profuse\r\napplication of gold in the details of ornament. Reacting on the art of\r\nthe west, the influence of the Byzantine or Greek school is not only\r\nprominent in such early works as the mosaics of Ravenna, but it has also\r\nleft its mark in the peculiar character of Italian pictorial art of the\r\nmiddle ages.\r\n\r\nVery few examples of early Byzantine work in MSS. have survived; but two\r\nfragmentary leaves (Brit. Mus., Add. MS. 5111) of tables of the Eusebian\r\ncanons, which must have stood at the beginning of a copy of the Gospels,\r\nexecuted no doubt in the Eastern capital in the 6th century, are\r\nsufficient to exemplify the splendour of ornament which might be\r\nlavished on book decoration at that date. The surface of the vellum is\r\nentirely gilt, and the ornamental designs are in classical style and\r\npainted in bright colours. Two well-known MSS., the Genesis of the\r\nImperial Library of Vienna, of the latter part of the 6th century, and\r\nthe Gospels of Rossano in southern Italy, of the same period, both\r\ncontaining series of illustrative paintings of a semi-classical type,\r\nare very interesting specimens of Byzantine art; but they depend on\r\ntheir purple vellum and their silver-written texts to claim a place\r\namong highly ornamented MSS., for the paintings themselves are devoid of\r\ngold. On the other hand, the Greek MS. of Genesis, of the 5th or 6th\r\ncentury, which once formed part of the Cottonian collection in the\r\nBritish Museum, but which was almost totally destroyed by fire, was of a\r\nmore artistic character: the drawing of its miniatures was of great\r\nmerit and classical in style, and gold shading was largely employed in\r\nthe details. The famous MS. of Dioscorides at Vienna, executed in the\r\nyear 472, is another excellent example of the early Byzantine school,\r\nits series of paintings at the beginning of the volume well maintaining\r\nthe classical sentiment.\r\n\r\nFrom such early examples Byzantine art advanced to a maturer style in\r\nthe 9th and 10th centuries, two MSS. in the Bibliothèque Nationale of\r\nParis being types of the best work of this time. These are: the copy of\r\nthe sermons of Gregory Nazianzen (MS. _Grec._ 510), executed about the\r\nyear 880 and containing a series of large miniatures, some being of the\r\nhighest excellence; and a psalter of the 10th century (MS. Grec. 139),\r\namong whose miniatures are examples which still maintain the old\r\nsentiment of classical art in a remarkable degree, one in particular,\r\nrepresenting David as the psalmist, being an adapted copy of a classical\r\nscene of Orpheus and the Muses. The same scene is repeated in a later\r\nPsalter in the Vatican: an instance of the repetition of favourite\r\nsubjects from one century to another which is common throughout the\r\nhistory of medieval art. At the period of the full maturity of the\r\nByzantine school great skill is displayed in the best examples of\r\nfigure-drawing, and a fine type of head and features is found in the\r\nminiatures of such MSS. as the _Homilies of Chrysostom_ at Paris, which\r\nbelonged to the emperor Nicephorus III., 1078-1081, and in the best\r\ncopies of the Gospels and Saints' Lives of that period, some of them\r\nbeing of exquisite finish. By this time also the scheme of decoration\r\nwas established. Brilliant gilded backgrounds, give lustre to the\r\nminiatures. Initial letters in gold and colours are in ordinary use;\r\nbut, it is to be observed, they never become very florid, but are rather\r\nmeagre in outline, nor do they develop the pendants and borders which\r\nare afterwards so characteristic of the illuminated MSS. of the west. By\r\nway of general decoration, the rectangular head-pieces, which are such\r\nprominent features in Greek MSS. from the 10th to the 13th centuries,\r\nflourish in flowered and tesselated and geometric patterns in bright\r\ncolours and gold. These are palpably of Oriental design, and may very\r\nwell have been suggested by the woven fabrics of western Asia.\r\n\r\nBut Byzantine art was not destined to have a great history. Too\r\nself-contained and, under ecclesiastical influence, too much secluded\r\nfrom the contact with other ideas and other influences which are vitally\r\nnecessary for healthy growth and expansion, it fell into stereotyped and\r\nformal convention and ran in narrow grooves. A general tendency was set\r\nup to paint the flesh tints in swarthy hues, to elongate and emaciate\r\nthe limbs, to stiffen the gait, and generally to employ sombre colours\r\nin the miniatures, the depressing effect of which the artist seems to\r\nhave felt himself compelled to relieve by rather startling contrasts of\r\nbright vermilion and lavish employment of gold. Still the initials and\r\nhead-pieces continued to retain their brilliancy, of which they could\r\nscarcely be deprived without losing their _raison d'être_ as decorative\r\nadjuncts. But, with all faults, fine and delicate drawing, with\r\ntechnical finish in the applied colours, is still characteristic of the\r\nbest Greek miniatures of the 10th to 12th centuries, and the fine type\r\nof head and features of the older time remains a tradition. For example,\r\nin the Gospel lectionary, Harleian MS. 1810, in the British Museum, of\r\nthe 12th century, there is a series of scenes from the life of Christ\r\nwhich are more than usually free from the contemporary conventionalism\r\nand which contain many figures of noble design. After the 12th century\r\nthere is little in the art of Greek MSS. to detain us. The later\r\nexamples, as far as they exist, are decadent and are generally lifeless\r\ncopies of the earlier MSS.\r\n\r\nByzantine art, as seen in Greek MSS., stands apart as a thing of itself.\r\nBut we shall have to consider how far and in what manner it had an\r\ninfluence on western art. Its reaction and influence on Italian art have\r\nbeen mentioned. That that influence was direct is manifest both in the\r\nstyle of such works as the mosaics of Italy and in the character of the\r\npaintings of the early Italian masters, and eventually in the earliest\r\nexamples of the illuminated MSS. of central and southern Italy. But it\r\nis not so obvious how the influence which the eastern art of the Greek\r\nschool undoubtedly exercised on the illuminated MSS. of the Frankish\r\nempire was conveyed. All things considered, however, it seems more\r\nprobable that it passed westward through the medium of Italian art\r\nrather than by actual contact, except perhaps in accidental instances.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Franco-Lombardic.\r\n\r\nWe turn to the west of Europe, and we shall see how in the elaborately\r\nornamented Frankish MSS. of the Carolingian school was combined the\r\nlingering tradition of the classical style with a new and independent\r\nelement which had grown up spontaneously in the north. This new factor\r\nwas the Celtic art which had its origin and was brought to perfection in\r\nthe illuminated MSS. of Ireland and afterwards of Britain. It will\r\ntherefore be convenient to trace the history of that school of book\r\nornamentation. But before doing so we must dispose, in few words, of the\r\nmore primitive style which preceded the Carolingian development in\r\nwestern continental Europe. This primitive style, which we may call the\r\nnative style, as distinguished from the more artificially compounded\r\nart of the revival under Charlemagne, seems to have been widely extended\r\nthroughout the Frankish empire and to have been common in Lombardy, and\r\nto some degree in Spain, as well as in France, and is known as\r\nMerovingian and Franco-Lombardic. This kind of ornamentation appears\r\nchiefly in the form of initial letters composed of birds, fishes and\r\nanimals contorted into the shapes of the alphabetical letters; and in a\r\nless degree of head-pieces and borders filled with interlacings, or\r\nbands, or geometrical patterns, and even details of animal life. In\r\nthese patterns, barbarous as they usually are, the influence of such\r\nartistic objects as mosaics and enamels is evident. The prevailing\r\ncolours are crude green, red, orange and yellow, which hold their place\r\nwith persistence through successive generations of MSS. This native\r\nstyle also, in course of time, came under Celtic influence, and adopted\r\ninto its scheme the interlaced designs of animal forms and other details\r\nof the ornament of the north. It is therefore necessary to bear in mind\r\nthat, side by side with the great series of Carolingian MSS., executed\r\nwith all possible magnificence, there was existent this native school\r\nproducing its examples of a more rustic character, which must be taken\r\ninto account when studying the development of the later national style\r\nin France, in the 10th and succeeding centuries.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Celtic\r\n\r\nTo turn now to the Celtic style of ornament in MSS. This we find in full\r\ndevelopment in Ireland as early as the 7th century. The Irish school of\r\nbook ornamentation was essentially a native school working out its own\r\nideas, created and fostered by the early civilization of the country and\r\ndestined to have a profound influence on the art of Britain and\r\neventually on that of the continent. It may be described as a mechanical\r\nart brought to the highest pitch of perfection by the most skilful and\r\npatient elaboration. Initials, borders and full-page designs are made up\r\nof interlaced ribbons, interlaced and entangled zoomorphic creatures,\r\nintricate knots, spirals, zig-zag ornaments, and delicate interwoven\r\npatterns, together with all kinds of designs worked out in red dots--all\r\narranged and combined together with mathematical accuracy and with\r\nexquisite precision of touch; and painted in harmonious colours in thick\r\npigments, which lend to the whole design the appearance of enamel. Gold\r\nis never used. In the production of his designs the Irish artist\r\nevidently took for his models the objects of early metal work in which\r\nthe Celtic race was so skilled, and probably, too, the classical enamels\r\nand mosaics and jewelry which had been imported and copied in the\r\ncountry. The finest example of early Celtic book ornamentation is the\r\nfamous copy of the Gospels known as the _Book of Kells_, of the latter\r\npart of the 7th century, preserved in Trinity College, Dublin: a miracle\r\nof minute and accurate workmanship, combining in its brilliant pages an\r\nendless variety of design.\r\n\r\nBut, with all his artistic excellence, the Irish artist failed\r\ncompletely in figure drawing; in fact he can hardly be said to have\r\nseriously attempted it. When we contemplate, for example, the rude\r\nfigures intended to represent the evangelists in early copies of the\r\nGospels, their limbs contorted and often composed of extraordinary\r\ninterlacings and convolutions, we wonder that the sense of beauty which\r\nthe Irish artist indubitably possessed in an eminent degree was not\r\nshocked by such barbarous productions. The explanation is probably to be\r\nfound in tradition. These figures in course of time had come to be\r\nregarded rather as details to be worked into the general scheme of the\r\nornament of the pages in which they occur than representations of the\r\nhuman form, and were accordingly treated by the artist as subjects on\r\nwhich to exercise his ingenuity in knotting them into fantastic shapes.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Lindisfarne Gospels.\r\n\r\nPassing from Ireland, the Celtic style of book ornamentation was\r\nnaturally practised in the monastic settlements of Scotland, and\r\nespecially in St Columba's foundation in the island of Iona. Thence it\r\nspread to other houses in Britain. In the year 635, at the request of\r\nOswald, king of Northumbria, Aidan, a monk of Iona, was sent to preach\r\nChristianity in that kingdom, and became the founder of the abbey and\r\nsee of Lindisfarne in Holy Isle off the Northumbrian coast. Here was\r\nestablished by the brethren who accompanied the missionary the famous\r\nschool of Lindisfarne, from which issued a wonderful series of finely\r\nwritten and finely ornamented MSS. in the Celtic style, some of which\r\nstill survive. The most perfect is the _Lindisfarne Gospels_ or _St\r\nCuthbert's Gospels_ or the _Durham Book_, as it is more commonly called\r\nfrom the fact of its having rested for some time at Durham after early\r\nwanderings. This MS., written in honour of St Cuthbert and completed\r\nearly in the 8th century, is in the Cottonian collection in the British\r\nMuseum--a beautiful example of writing, and of the Celtic style of\r\nornament, and in perfect condition. The contact with foreign influences,\r\nunknown in Ireland, is manifested in this volume by the use of gold, but\r\nin very sparing quantity, in some of the details. An interesting point\r\nin the artistic treatment of the MS. is the style in which the figures\r\nof the four evangelists are portrayed. Here the conventional Irish\r\nmethod, noticed above, is abandoned; the figures are mechanical copies\r\nfrom Byzantine models. The artist was unskilled in such drawing and has\r\nindicated the folds of the draperies, not by shading, but by streaks of\r\npaint of contrasting colours. Explanations of such instances of the\r\nunexpected adoption of a foreign style are rarely forthcoming; but in\r\nthis case there is one. The sections of the text have been identified as\r\nfollowing the Neapolitan use. The Greek Theodore, archbishop of\r\nCanterbury, arrived in Britain in the year 688 and was accompanied by\r\nAdrian, abbot of a monastery in the island of Nisita near Naples; and\r\nthey both visited Lindisfarne. There can therefore be little doubt that\r\nthe Neapolitan MS. from which the text of the _Durham Book_ was derived,\r\nwas one which Abbot Adrian had brought with him; and it may also be\r\nassumed that his MS. also contained paintings of the evangelists in the\r\nByzantine style, which served as models to the Northumbrian artist.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Carolingian.\r\n\r\nThe Celtic style was thus established through the north of England, and\r\nthence it spread to the southern parts of the country. But, for the\r\nmoment, the account of its further development in Britain must be\r\nsuspended in order to resume the thread of the story of the later\r\nclassical influence on the illumination of MSS. of the Frankish empire.\r\nUnder Charlemagne, who became emperor of the West in the year 800, art\r\nrevived in many branches, and particularly in that of the writing and\r\nthe illumination of MSS. During the reigns of this monarch and his\r\nimmediate successors was produced a series of magnificent volumes,\r\nmostly biblical and liturgical, made resplendent by a lavish use of\r\ngold. The character of the decoration runs still, as of old, in the two\r\nlines of illustration and of pure ornament. We find a certain amount of\r\ngeneral illustration, usually of the biblical narrative, in pictorial\r\nscenes drawn in freehand in the later classical style, and undoubtedly\r\ninspired by the western art of Rome. But those illustrations are small\r\nin number compared with the numerous examples of pure ornament. Such\r\nornament was employed in the tables of the Eusebian canons, in the\r\naccessories of the traditional pictures of the evangelists, in the\r\nfull-page designs which introduced the opening words of the several\r\nbooks of Bibles or Gospels, in the large initial letters profusely\r\nscattered through the volumes, in the infinite variety of borders which,\r\nin some MSS., adorned page after page. In all this ornament the debased\r\nclassical element is prominently in evidence, columns and arches of\r\nvariegated marbles, and leaf mouldings and other architectural details\r\nare borrowed from the Roman basilicas, to serve as decorations for text\r\nand miniature. The conventional portrait-figures of the evangelists are\r\nmodelled on the Byzantine pattern, but with differences which appear to\r\nindicate an intervening influence, such as would be exercised on the\r\neastern art by its transmission through Italy. Such figures, which\r\nindeed become, in course of time, so formal as almost to be decorative\r\ndetails along with their settings, grew stereotyped and passed on\r\nmonotonously from artist to artist, always subject to deterioration, and\r\nwere perpetuated especially in MSS. of German origin down to the 11th\r\nand 12th centuries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE II.\r\n\r\n  PSALTER OF WESTMINSTER ABBEY.--LATE TWELFTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\n  (British Museum. _Royal MS._ 2A. xxii.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE III.\r\n\r\n  LECTIONARY, OF THE USE OF PARIS. LATE THIRTEENTH CENTURY. (British\r\n  Museum. Add. M.S. 17,341.)]\r\n\r\nBut it is not the debased classical decoration alone which marks the\r\nillumination of the Carolingian school. The influence of the Celtic art,\r\nwhich has been described, imposed itself and combined with it. This\r\ncombination was due to the Englishman, Alcuin of York, who became abbot\r\nof the Benedictine house of St Martin of Tours, and who did so much to\r\naid Charlemagne in the revival of letters. Thus, in the finest examples\r\nof the Carolingian illuminated MSS., Celtic interlaced patterns stand\r\nside by side with the designs of classical origin; and, at the same\r\ntime, it is interesting to observe that the older native Merovingian\r\nstyle of ornament makes its presence felt, now and again, in this or\r\nthat detail. But with all the artistic effort bestowed upon it, it must\r\nbe conceded that Carolingian illumination, as presented in the MSS., is\r\nnot always pleasing. Indeed, it is often coarse and monotonous, and\r\nthere is a tendency to conceal inferiority under a dazzling abundance of\r\ngold. The leading idea of the ornament of the great MSS. was splendour.\r\nGold was used in profusion even in the writing of the text, and silver\r\nalso in a minor degree; and the vellum, stained or painted purple,\r\nenhanced the gorgeous effect of the illumination. But undoubtedly the\r\npurer style of the Celtic school balanced and restrained the tendency to\r\ncoarseness; and this foreign influence naturally was stronger in some\r\ncentres than in others. For example, in the abbey of Saint-Denis, near\r\nParis, if we may draw conclusions from surviving examples, the Celtic\r\nstyle was in great favour. Another peculiarity in the decoration of the\r\nCarolingian MSS. is the tendency of the artist to mix his styles, and to\r\nattach details on a small scale, such as delicate sprays and flourishes,\r\nand minute objects, to large-scale initial letters, as though he felt\r\nthat grossness required a corrective contrast. The art became more\r\nrefined under the immediate successors of Charlemagne, and under Charles\r\nthe Bald it culminated. The most famous MSS. of the Carolingian school\r\nare the _Evangeliarium_, written and illuminated by the scribe Godescalc\r\nfor Charlemagne in the year 787; the _Sacramentarium_ written for\r\nDrogon, son of Charlemagne and bishop of Metz; the Gospels of the\r\nemperor Lothair, once at Tours; the first Bible of Charles the Bald,\r\npresented by Count Vivien, abbot of St Martin of Tours; the second\r\nBible, called the Bible of Saint Denis, in Franco-Saxon style; and the\r\nso-called Gospels of Francis II. There are also in the British Museum\r\n(Harleian MS. 2788) an Evangeliarium written in gold and known as the\r\n_Codex aureus_, of this school; and a Bible of Alcuin's recension,\r\nprobably executed at Tours in the middle of the 9th century, with\r\nillustrative miniatures and initial letters, but of a less elaborate\r\ndegree of ornament.\r\n\r\nAfter this brilliant period decadence sets in; and in the course of the\r\n11th century Frankish illumination sinks to its lowest point, the\r\nminiatures being for the most part coarse and clumsy copies of earlier\r\nmodels. The colours become harsh, often assuming an unpleasant chalky\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nWe have now to trace the development of another kind of book decoration,\r\nquite different from the florid style of gold and colours just now\r\ndescribed, which had a lasting influence on the early art of England,\r\nwhere it was specially cultivated, and where it developed a character\r\nwhich at length became distinctively national. This is the style of\r\noutline drawing which fills so large a space in the Anglo-Saxon MSS. of\r\nthe 10th and 11th centuries.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Anglo-Saxon.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen how the Celtic style of ornamentation was\r\nintroduced into the north of England. Thence it appears to have spread\r\nrapidly southward. As early as the beginning of the 8th century it was\r\npractised at Canterbury, as is testified by a famous psalter in the\r\nBritish Museum (Cott. MS. Vespasian A. 1), in which much of the ornament\r\nis of Celtic type. But the same MS. is also witness to the presence of\r\nanother influence in English art, that of the classical style of Rome,\r\ncertain details of the ornament being of that character and a miniature\r\nin the MS. being altogether of the classical type. With little\r\nhesitation this element may be ascribed to MSS. brought from Rome, in\r\nthe first instance by St Augustine, and afterwards by the incoming\r\nmissionaries who succeeded him, and deposited in such centres as\r\nCanterbury and Winchester. But this importation of MSS. from Italy was\r\nnot confined to the south. We have distinct evidence that they were\r\nbrought into northern monasteries, such as those of Jarrow and Wearmouth\r\nand York. Thus the English artists of both south and north were in a\r\nposition to take advantage of material from two sources; and they\r\nnaturally did so. Thus we find that mingling of the Celtic and classical\r\nstyles just noticed. In this way, early grown accustomed to take\r\nclassical models for their drawings, the Anglo-Saxon artists were the\r\nmore susceptible to the later development of the classical style of\r\noutline drawing which was next introduced into the country from the\r\ncontinent. The earliest MS. in which this style of drawing is exhibited\r\nin fullest detail is the volume known as the _Utrecht Psalter_, once in\r\nthe Cottonian Library, in which the text of the psalms is profusely\r\nillustrated with minute pen-sketches remarkably full of detail. The\r\nperiod of the MS. is about the year 800; and it was probably executed in\r\nthe north or north-east of France. But the special interest of the\r\ndrawings is that they are evidently copies of much older models and\r\nprovide a valuable link with the late classical art of some two or three\r\ncenturies earlier. The work is very sketchy, the movement of the\r\ndraperies indicated by lightly scribbled strokes of the pen, the limbs\r\nelongated, the shoulders humped--all characteristic features which are\r\nrepeated in the later Anglo-Saxon work. The drawings of the _Utrecht\r\nPsalter_ are clearly typical examples of a style which, founded on Roman\r\nmodels, must at one time have been widely practised in western Europe.\r\nFor instance, there are traces of it in such a centre as St Gallen in\r\nSwitzerland, and there are extant MSS. of the _Psychomachia_ of\r\nPrudentius (a favourite work) with drawings of this character which were\r\nexecuted in France in the 10th century. But the style does not appear to\r\nhave taken much hold on the fancy of continental artists. It was\r\nreserved for England to welcome and to make this free drawing her own,\r\nand to develop it especially in the great school of illumination at\r\nWinchester. Introduced probably in such examples as the _Utrecht\r\nPsalter_ and copies of the _Psychomachia_, this free drawing of\r\nsemi-classical origin had fully established itself here in the course of\r\nthe 10th century, and by that time had assumed a national character. A\r\nfair number of MSS. of the 10th and 11th centuries which issued from the\r\nWinchester school are still to be seen among the collections of the\r\nBritish museum, in most of which the light style of outline drawing with\r\nthe characteristic fluttering drapery is more or less predominant,\r\nalthough body colours were also freely employed in many examples. But\r\nthe most elaborate specimen of Anglo-Saxon illumination of the 10th\r\ncentury is one belonging to the duke of Devonshire: the _Benedictional_\r\nof the see of Winchester, executed under the direction of Æthelwold,\r\nbishop from 963 to 984, which contains a series of miniatures, in this\r\ninstance in body colours, but drawn in the unmistakable style of the new\r\nschool. In the scheme of decoration, however, another influence is at\r\nwork. As England had sent forth its early Celtic designs to modify the\r\nart of the Frankish empire, so the Carolingian style of ornament now, in\r\nits turn, makes its way into this country, and appears in the purely\r\nornamental details of the Anglo-Saxon illuminated volumes. The frames of\r\nthe miniatures are chiefly composed of conventional foliage, and the\r\nsame architectural leaf-mouldings of classical origin which are seen in\r\nthe foreign MSS. are here repeated. Profuse gilding also, which is\r\nfrequently applied, sometimes with silver, is due to foreign influence.\r\nBut this character of decoration soon assumed a national cast. Under the\r\nhands of the Anglo-Saxon artist the conventional foliage flourished with\r\ngreater freedom; and the colouring which he applied was generally softer\r\nand more harmonious than that which was employed abroad. Examples of\r\noutline drawing of the best type exist in the Harleian _Psalter_ (No.\r\n2904), of the same period as the Æthelwold _Benedictional_; in the\r\nregister of New Minster (Stowe MS. 944), A.D. 1016-1020; and in the\r\nPrudentius (Cotton MS. Cleop. C. viii.), executed early in the 11th\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Norman.\r\n\r\nWith the Norman Conquest naturally great changes were effected in the\r\nillumination of English MSS., as in other branches of art; no doubt to\r\nthe ultimate improvement of English draughtsmanship. Left to itself the\r\noutline drawing of the Anglo-Saxons, inclining as it did to affectation,\r\nwould probably have sunk into fantastic exaggeration and feebleness.\r\nBrought more directly under Norman domination it resulted in the fine,\r\nbold freehand style which is conspicuous in MSS. executed in England in\r\nthe next three centuries. Then we come to the period when the art of\r\nillumination is brought into line in the countries of western Europe, in\r\nEngland and in France, in Flanders and in western Germany, by the\r\nsplendid outburst of artistic sentiment of the 12th century. This\r\ncentury is the period of large folios providing ample space in their\r\npages for the magnificent initial letters drawn on a grand scale which\r\nare to be seen in the great Bibles and psalters of the time. The leading\r\nfeature is a wealth of foliage with twining and interlacing branches,\r\namong which human and animal life is freely introduced, the whole design\r\nbeing thrown into relief by brilliant colours and a generous use of\r\ngold. The figure drawing both in miniatures and initials is stiff, the\r\nfigures elongated but bold, and with sweeping lines in the draperies;\r\nand a tendency to represent the latter clinging closely to the limbs is\r\na legacy of the tradition of the later classical style. In England the\r\nschool of Winchester appears to have maintained the same excellence\r\nafter the Norman Conquest as before it. A remarkable MS. (Cotton, Nero\r\nC. iv.), a psalter of about the year 1160, with a series of fine\r\nminiatures, is a good example of its work. In France, Flanders and\r\nwestern Germany we find the same energy in producing boldly ornamented\r\nvolumes, as in England; a certain heaviness of outline distinguishing\r\nthe work of the Flemish and German artists from that of the English and\r\nFrench schools. Such MSS. as the Stavelot Bible (Brit. Mus., Add. MS.\r\n28,107), of the close of the 11th century, the Bible of Floreffe (Add.\r\nMS. 17,737-17,738), of about the year 1160, and the Worms Bible (Harl.\r\nMS. 2803-2804), of the same time, are fine specimens of Flemish and\r\nGerman work.\r\n\r\n\r\n  13th Century.\r\n\r\nIt is towards the close of the 12th century and in the beginning of the\r\n13th century that the character of illumination settles down on more\r\nconventional lines. Hitherto gold had been applied in a liquid state;\r\nnow it is laid on in leaf and is highly burnished, a process which lends\r\na brilliant effect to initial and miniature. A great change passes over\r\nthe face of things. The large, bold style gives place to the minute.\r\nVolumes decrease in size; the texts are written in close-packed\r\ncharacters; the large and simple is superseded by the small and\r\ndecorated. The period has arrived when book ornamentation becomes more\r\nsettled and accurately defined within limits, and starts on the course\r\nof regulated expansion which was to run for three hundred years down to\r\nthe close of the 15th century. In the 13th century the historiated or\r\nminiature initial, that is, the initial letter containing within its\r\nlimits a miniature illustrating the subject of the immediate text, is\r\nestablished as a favourite detail of ornamentation, in addition to the\r\nregular independent miniature. Such initials form a prominent feature in\r\nthe pretty little Bibles which were produced in hundreds at this period.\r\nBut a still more interesting subject for study is the development of the\r\nborder which was to have such a luxuriant growth in the 13th, 14th and\r\n15th centuries. Commencing as a pendant from the initial, with terminal\r\nin form of bud or cusp, it gradually pushes its way along the margins,\r\nunfolding foliage as it proceeds, and in course of time envelopes the\r\nentire page of text in a complete framework formulating in each country\r\na national style.\r\n\r\nIn the miniatures of the 13th century the art of England, of France, and\r\nof the Low Countries runs very much in one channel. The Flemish art,\r\nhowever, may be generally distinguished from the others by the heavier\r\noutline already noticed. The French art is exquisitely exact and\r\nclean-cut, and in its best examples it is the perfection of\r\nneat-handedness. English art is perhaps less exact, but makes up for any\r\ndeficiency in this direction by its gracefulness. However, there is\r\noften little to choose between the productions of the three countries,\r\nand they are hard to distinguish. As an aid for such distinction, among\r\nsmall differences, we may notice the copper tone of French gold\r\ncontrasting with the purer metal in English MSS.; and the favour shown\r\nto deep ultramarine appears to mark French work. But, besides actual\r\nilluminated miniature painting, there is also a not inconsiderable\r\namount of freehand illustrative drawing in the MSS. In this particular\r\nthe English artist maintains the excellence of work which distinguished\r\nhis ancestors. Such series of delicate drawings, slightly tinted, as\r\nthose to be seen in the famous Queen Mary's Psalter (Royal MS. 2 B.\r\nvii.), and in other MSS. of the 13th and 14th centuries in the British\r\nMuseum, are not surpassed by any similar drawings done at the same\r\nperiod in any other country. In the 13th century also comes into vogue\r\nthe highly decorated diaper-work, generally of lozenges or chequered\r\npatterns in brilliant colours and brightly burnished gold. These fill\r\nthe backgrounds of miniatures and initials, together with other forms of\r\ndecoration, such as sheets of gold stippled or surface-drawn in various\r\ndesigns. Diapering continued to be practised in all three countries down\r\ninto the 15th century; and in particular it is applied with exquisite\r\neffect in many of the highly-finished MSS. of the artists of Paris.\r\n\r\nTo return to the growth of the borders: these continue to be generally\r\nof one style in both England and France and in Flanders during the 13th\r\ncentury; but, when with the opening of the 14th century the conventional\r\nfoliage begins to expand, a divergence ensues. In France and Flanders\r\nthe three-pointed leaf, or ivy leaf, appears, which soon becomes fixed\r\nand flourishes as a typical detail of ornament in French illumination of\r\nthe 14th and 15th centuries. In England there is less convention, and\r\nalong with formal branches and leafage, natural growths, such as\r\ndaisy-buds, acorns, oak leaves, nuts, &c., are also represented.\r\n\r\n\r\n  German.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile German illumination, which in the large MSS. of the 12th\r\ncentury had given high promise, in the following centuries falls away\r\nand becomes detached from the western schools, and is, as a general\r\nrule, of inferior quality, although in the 13th century fine examples\r\nare still to be met with. Dark outlines and backgrounds of\r\nhighly-burnished gold are in favour. At present, however, there is not\r\nsufficient published material to enable us to pass a definite judgment\r\non the value of German illumination in the later middle ages. But the\r\nresearches of scholars are beginning to localize particular styles in\r\ncertain centres. For example, in Bohemia there was a school of\r\nillumination of a higher class, which seems later to have had an\r\ninfluence on English art, as will be noticed presently.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Italian.\r\n\r\nWe must now turn to Italy, which has been left on one side during our\r\nexamination of the art of the more western countries. In attempting to\r\nbridge the gap which severs the later classical style of Rome from the\r\nmedieval art of Italy, much must be left to conjecture. That a debased\r\nclassical style of drawing was employed in the earlier centuries of the\r\nmiddle ages we cannot doubt. Such a MS. as the Ashburnham Genesis of the\r\n7th century, which contains pictures of a somewhat rude character but\r\nbased apparently upon a recollection of the classical drawing of earlier\r\ntimes, and which appears to be of Italian origin, serves as a link,\r\nhowever slight. Coming down to a later period, the primitive native art\r\nof the Frankish empire, as we have seen, extended into northern Italy\r\nunder the name of Franco-Lombardic ornamentation; and we have also seen\r\nhow the art of the Byzantine school reacted on the art of the southern\r\nportion of the country. Hence, in the middle ages, the ornamentation of\r\nItalian MSS. appears to move on two leading lines. The first, which we\r\nowe to the Byzantine influence, in which figure-drawing is the leading\r\nidea, follows the old classical method and, showing a distinctly Greek\r\nimpress, leads to the style which we recognize as Italian _par\r\nexcellence_, and which is seen most effectively manifested in the works\r\nof Cimabue and Giotto and of allied schools. In this style the colouring\r\nis generally opaque: the flesh tints being laid over a foundation of\r\ndeep olive green, which imparts a swarthy complexion to the features--a\r\npractice also common in Byzantine art. The other line is that of the\r\nLombardic style which, like the Celtic school of the British Isles,\r\nwas an art almost exclusively of pure ornament, of intricate\r\ninterlacings of arabesques and animal forms, with bright colouring and\r\nample use of gold. The Lombardic style was employed in certain centres,\r\nas, for example, at Monte Cassino, where in the 11th, 12th and 13th\r\ncenturies brilliant examples were produced. But it was not destined to\r\nstand before the other, stronger and inherently more artistic, style\r\nwhich was to become national. Still, its scheme of brighter colouring\r\nand of general ornament seems to have had an effect upon later\r\nproductions, if we are not mistaken in recognizing something of its\r\ninfluence in such designs as the interlaced white vine-branch borders\r\nwhich are so conspicuous in Italian MSS. of the period of the\r\nRenaissance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE IV.\r\n\r\n  DURANDUS. DE DlVINIS OFFICIIS. FOURTEENTH CENTURY. Italian School.\r\n  (British Museum. Add. MS. 31,032.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE V.\r\n\r\n  VALERIUS MAXIMUS. ABOUT A.D. 1475. Executed for Philippe de Comines.\r\n  (British Museum. _Harley M.S._ 4374.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n  14th Century.\r\n\r\nThe progress of Italian illumination in the style influenced by the\r\nByzantine element is of particular interest in the general history of\r\nart, on account of the rapidity with which it grew to maturity, and the\r\nsplendour to which it attained in the 15th century. Of the earlier\r\ncenturies the existing examples are not many. That Italian artists were\r\ncapable of great things as far back as the 12th century is evident from\r\ntheir frescoes. We may notice the curious occurrence of two very\r\nmasterly paintings, the death of the Virgin and the Virgin enthroned,\r\ndrawn with remarkable breadth in the Italian style, in the _Winchester\r\nPsalter_ (Cottonian MS. Nero C. iv.) of the middle of that century, as a\r\ntoken of the possibilities of Italian illumination at that date; but\r\ngenerally there is little to show. Even at the beginning of the 14th\r\ncentury most of the specimens are of an ordinary character and betray a\r\nwant of skill in striking contrast with the highly artistic productions\r\nof the Northern schools of England and France at the same period. But,\r\nthough inferior artistically, Italian book ornamentation had by this\r\ntime been so far influenced by the methods of those schools as to fall\r\ninto line with them in the general system of decoration. The miniature,\r\nthe initial, the miniature-initial and the border--all have their place\r\nand are subject to the same laws of development as in the other schools.\r\nBut, once started, Italian illumination in the 14th century, especially\r\nin Florence, expanded with extraordinary energy. We may cite the Royal\r\nMS. 6, E. ix., containing an address to Robert of Anjou, king of Sicily,\r\n1334-1342, and the Add. MS. 27,428 of legends of the saints, of about\r\nthe year 1370, as instances of very fine miniature-work of the\r\nFlorentine type. As the century advances, Italian illumination becomes\r\nmore prolific and is extended to all classes of MSS., the large volumes\r\nof the Decretals and other law books, and still more the great folio\r\nchoral books, in particular affording ample space for the artist to\r\nexercise his fancy. As was natural from the contiguity of the two\r\ncountries, as well as from political causes, France and Italy influenced\r\neach other in the art. In many MSS. of the Florentine school the French\r\ninfluence is very marked, and on the other hand, Italian influence is\r\nexercised especially in MSS. of the southern provinces of France.\r\nItalian art of this period also in some degree affected the illumination\r\nof southern German MSS.\r\n\r\nWe have also to note the occurrence in Italy in the 14th century of good\r\nillustrative outline drawings, generally tinted in light colours, and\r\noccasionally we meet with a wonderfully bright style of illumination of\r\na lighter cast of colouring than usually prevails in Italian art: such\r\nas may be seen in a MS. of Durandus _De divinis oficiis_ (Brit. Mus.,\r\nAdd. MS. 31,032) containing an exquisite series of initials and borders.\r\n\r\nTaking a general view of the character of European illumination in the\r\n14th century it may be described as an art of great invention and\r\nflexibility. The rigid exactness of the 13th century is replaced by\r\nflowing lines, just as the stiff, formal strokes of the handwriting of\r\nthat century was exchanged for a more cursive and easy style. The art of\r\neach individual country now developed a national type of its own, which\r\nagain branched off into the different styles of provincial schools. For\r\nexample, in the eastern counties of England a very fine school of\r\nillumination, the East Anglian, was established in the first half of the\r\ncentury and produced a series of beautiful MSS., such as the _Arundel\r\nPsalter_ (No. 83) in the British Museum.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Distinctive Borders.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the century the borders had developed on national lines so\r\nfully as to become, more than any other detail in the general scheme,\r\nthe readiest means of identifying the country of origin. First as to the\r\nEnglish border: the favour shown to the introduction of natural growths\r\namong the conventional foliage thrown out from the frame into which the\r\nborder had by this time expanded has already been noticed. But now a new\r\nfeature is introduced. The frame up to this time had consisted generally\r\nof conventional branches with bosses at the corners. Now it is divided\r\nmore into compartments within which twining coils of ornament resembling\r\ncut feather-work are common details; and feathery scrolls fill the\r\ncorner-bosses and are attached to other parts of the frame; while the\r\nfoliage thrown out into the margin takes the form of sprays of curious\r\nlobe- or spoon-shaped and lozenge-shaped leaves or flowers, with others\r\nresembling curled feathers, and with cup- and trumpet-shaped flowers.\r\nThis new style of border is contemporaneous with the appearance of a\r\nremarkably brilliant style in the miniatures, good in drawing and rich\r\nin colouring; and an explanation for the change has been sought in\r\nforeign influence. It has been suggested, with some plausibility, that\r\nthis influence comes from the school of Prague, through the marriage of\r\nRichard II. with Anne of Bohemia in 1382. However this may be, there\r\ncertainly is a decidedly German sentiment in the feathery scrolls just\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nTurning to the French border, we find towards the close of the 14th\r\ncentury that the early ivy-leaf pendant has now invaded all the margins\r\nand that the page is set in a conventional frame throwing off on every\r\nside sprigs and waving scrolls of the conventional ivy foliage, often\r\nalso accompanied with very delicate compact tracery of minute\r\nflower-work filling the background of the frame. Nothing can be more\r\ncharming than the effect of such borders, in which the general design is\r\nunder perfect control. The character, too, of the French miniature of\r\nthis period harmonizes thoroughly with the brilliant border, composed as\r\nit is very largely of decorative elements, such as diapered patterns and\r\ndetails of burnished gold. In the Low Countries, as was natural, the\r\ninfluence of French art continued to have great weight, at least in the\r\nwestern provinces where the style of illumination followed the French\r\nlead.\r\n\r\nThe Italian border in its ordinary form was of independent character,\r\nalthough following the methods of the West. Thrown out from the initial,\r\nit first took the form of pendants of a peculiarly heavy conventional\r\ncurling foliage, associated, as progress was made, with slender rods\r\njointed at intervals with bud-like ornaments and extending along the\r\nmargins; at length expanding into a frame. The employment of gilt spots\r\nor pellets to fill spaces in the pendants and borders becomes very\r\nmarked as the century advances. They are at first in a simple form, but\r\nthey gradually throw out rays, and in the latter shape they become the\r\nchief constituents of one kind of border of the 15th century.\r\n\r\n\r\n  15th Century.\r\n\r\nIllumination in the 15th century enters on a new phase. The balance is\r\nno longer evenly maintained between the relative values of the miniature\r\nand the border as factors in the general scheme of decoration. The\r\ninfluence of a new sentiment in art makes itself felt more and more; the\r\nflat treatment of the miniature gradually gives place to true laws of\r\nperspective and of figure-drawing, and to the depth and atmospheric\r\neffects of modern painting. Miniature painting in the decoration of MSS.\r\nnow became more of a trade; what in old times had been done in the\r\ncloister was now done in the shop; and the professional miniaturist,\r\nworking for his own fame, took the place of the nameless monk who worked\r\nfor the credit of his house. Henceforth the miniature occupies a more\r\nimportant place than ever in the illuminated MS.; while the border, with\r\ncertain important exceptions, is apt to recede into an inferior position\r\nand to become rather an ornamental adjunct to set off the miniature than\r\na work of art claiming equality with it.\r\n\r\nContinuing the survey of the several national styles, we shall have to\r\nwitness the final supersession of the older styles of England and\r\nFrance by the later developments of Italy and Flanders. We left English\r\nillumination at the close of the 14th century strengthened by a fresh\r\ninfusion of apparently a foreign, perhaps Bohemian, source. The style\r\nthus evolved marks a brilliant but short-lived epoch in English art. It\r\nis not confined to MSS., but appears also in the paintings of the time,\r\nas, for example, in the portrait of Richard II. in Westminster Abbey and\r\nin that in the Wilton triptych belonging to the earl of Pembroke.\r\nDelicate but brilliant colouring, gold worked in stippled patterns and a\r\ncareful modelling of the human features are its characteristics. In MSS.\r\nalso the decorative borders, of the new pattern already described, are\r\nof exceptional richness. Brilliant examples of the style, probably\r\nexecuted for Richard himself, may be seen in a magnificent Bible (Royal\r\nMS. 1, E. ix.), and in a series of cuttings from a missal (Add. MS.\r\n29,704-29,705) in the British Museum. But the promise of this new school\r\nwas not to be fulfilled. The same style of border decoration was carried\r\ninto the 15th century, and good examples are found down to the middle of\r\nit, but a general deterioration soon sets in. Two MSS. must, however, be\r\nspecially mentioned as surviving instances of the fine type of work\r\nwhich could still be turned out early in the century; and, curiously,\r\nthey are both the productions of one and the same illuminator, the\r\nDominican, John Siferwas. The first is a fragmentary Lectionary (Brit.\r\nMus., Harl. MS., 7026) executed for John, Lord Lovel of Tichmersh, who\r\ndied in 1408; the other is the famous Sherborne Missal, the property of\r\nthe duke of Northumberland, a large volume completed about the same time\r\nfor the Benedictine abbey of Sherborne in Dorsetshire. Certainly other\r\nMSS. of equal excellence must have existed; but they have now perished.\r\nAfter the middle of the 15th century English illumination may be said to\r\nhave ceased, for the native style disappears before foreign imported\r\nart. This failure is sufficiently accounted for by the political state\r\nof the country and the distractions of the War of the Roses.\r\n\r\nIn France the 15th century opened more auspiciously for the art of\r\nillumination. Brilliant colouring and the diapered background glittering\r\nwith gold, the legacy of the previous century, still continue in favour\r\nfor some time; the border, too, of ivy-leaf tracery still holds its own.\r\nBut in actual drawing there are signs, as time advances, of growing\r\ncarelessness, and the artist appears to think more of the effect of\r\ncolour than of draughtsmanship. This was only natural at a time when the\r\nreal landscape began to replace the background of diaper and\r\nconventional rocks and trees. In the first quarter of the century the\r\nschool of Paris comes prominently to the front with such magnificent\r\nvolumes as the Book of Hours of the regent, John Plantagenet, duke of\r\nBedford, now in the British Museum; and the companion MS. known as the\r\nSobieski Hours, at Windsor. In these examples, as is always the case\r\nwith masterpieces, we see a great advance upon earlier methods. The\r\nminiatures are generally exquisitely painted in brilliant colours and\r\nthe drawing is of a high standard; and in the borders now appear natural\r\nflowers intermingled with the conventional tracery--a new idea which was\r\nto be carried further as the century advanced. The Psalter executed at\r\nParis for the boy-king Henry VI. (Cotton MS. Domitian A. xviii.) is\r\nanother example of this school, rather of earlier type than the Bedford\r\nMS., but beautifully painted. In all three MSS. the borders show no lack\r\nof finish; they are of a high standard and are worthy of the miniatures.\r\nBut perhaps the very finest miniature-work to be found in any MS. of\r\nFrench origin of this period is the breviary (Harl. MS. 2897)\r\nilluminated for John the Fearless, duke of Burgundy, who was\r\nassassinated in 1419. It could hardly be surpassed in refinement and\r\nminuteness of detail.\r\n\r\nDevelopment towards the modern methods of painting moves on rapidly with\r\nthe century. First, the border in the middle period grows florid; the\r\nsimpler ivy-spray design, which had held its position so long, is\r\ngradually pushed away by a growth of flowering scrolls, with flowers,\r\nbirds and animal and insect life introduced in more or less profusion.\r\nBut henceforward deterioration increases, and the border becomes\r\nsubsidiary. In the case of miniatures following the old patterns of the\r\ndevotional and liturgical books, a certain restraint still prevails; but\r\nwith those in other works, histories and romances and general\r\nliterature, where the paintings are devised by the fancy of the artist,\r\nthe advance is rapid. The recognition of the natural landscape, the\r\nperception of atmospheric effects now guide the artist's brush, and the\r\nmodern French school of the second half of the 15th century is fairly\r\nestablished. The most celebrated leaders of this school were Jean\r\nFoucquet of Tours and his sons, many of whose works still bear witness\r\nto their skill. In the MSS. of this school the influence of the Flemish\r\ncontemporary art is very obvious; and before the advance of that art\r\nFrench illumination receded. A certain hardness of surface and want of\r\ndepth characterize the French work of this time, as well as the practice\r\nof employing gilt hatching to obtain the high lights. This practice is\r\ncarried to excess in the latest examples of French illumination in the\r\nearly part of the 16th century, when the art became mechanical and\r\noverloaded with ornament, and thus expired.\r\n\r\nIt has been seen that the Flemish school of illumination in the 13th and\r\n14th centuries followed the French model. In the 15th century, while the\r\nold tradition continued in force for a while, the art developed on an\r\nindependent line; and in the second half of the century it exercised a\r\nwidespread influence on the neighbouring countries, on France, on\r\nHolland and on Germany. This development was one of the results of the\r\nindustrial and artistic activity of the Low Countries at this period,\r\nwhen the school of the Van Eycks and their followers, and of other\r\nartists of the great and wealthy cities, such as Bruges, Antwerp, Ghent,\r\nwere so prolific. The Flemish miniatures naturally followed on the lines\r\nof painting. The new style was essentially modern, freeing itself from\r\nthe traditions of medieval illumination and copying nature. Under the\r\nhand of the Flemish artist the landscape attained to great perfection,\r\nsoftness and depth of colouring, the leading attribute of the school,\r\nlending a particular charm and sense of reality to his out-door scenes.\r\nHis closer observation of nature is testified also in the purely\r\ndecorative part of his work. Flowers, insects, birds and other natural\r\nobjects now frequent the border, the origin of which is finally\r\nforgotten. It ceases to be a connected growth wandering round the page;\r\nit becomes a flat frame of dull gold or colour, over which isolated\r\nobjects, flowers, fruits, insects, butterflies, are strewn, painted with\r\nnaturalistic accuracy and often made, by means of strong shadows, to\r\nstand out in relief against the background. This practice was soon\r\ncarried to florid excess, and all kinds of objects, including jewels and\r\npersonal ornaments, were pressed into the service of the border, in\r\naddition to the details copied from nature. The soft beauty of the later\r\nFlemish style proved very attractive to the taste of the day, with the\r\nresult that it maintained a high standard well on into the 16th century,\r\nthe only rivals being the MSS. of Italian art. The names of celebrated\r\nminiaturists, such as Memlinc, Simon Bening of Ghent, Gerard of Bruges,\r\nare associated with its productions; and many famous extant examples\r\nbear witness to the excellence to which it attained. The Grimani\r\nBreviary at Venice is one of the best known MSS. of the school; but\r\nalmost every national library has specimens to boast of. Among those in\r\nthe British Museum may be mentioned the breviary of Queen Isabella of\r\nSpain (Add. MS. 18,851); the Book of Hours of Juana of Castille (Add.\r\nMS. 18,852); a very beautiful Book of Hours executed at Bruges (Egerton\r\nMS. 2125); another exquisite but fragmentary MS. of the same type (Add.\r\nMS. 24,098) and cuttings from a calendar of the finest execution (Add.\r\nMS. 18,855) ascribed to Bening of Ghent; a series of large sheets of\r\ngenealogies of the royal houses of Portugal and Spain (Add. MS. 12,531)\r\nby the same master and others; and late additions to the Sforza Book of\r\nHours (Add. MS. 34,294).\r\n\r\nBut, besides the brilliantly coloured style of Flemish illumination\r\nwhich has been described, there was another which was practised with\r\ngreat effect in the 15th century. This was the simpler style of drawing\r\nin white delicately shaded to indicate the contour of figures and the\r\nfolds of drapery, &c., known as _grisaille_ or _camaïeu gris_. It was\r\nnot indeed confined to the Flemish schools, but was practised also to\r\nsome extent and to good effect in northern France, and also in Holland\r\nand other countries; but the centre of its activity appears to have been\r\nin the Low Countries. The excellence to which it attained may be seen in\r\nthe MSS. of the _Miracles de Nostre Dame_ now in Paris and the Bodleian\r\nLibrary, which were executed for Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy, in\r\nthe middle of the 15th century.\r\n\r\nOf the Dutch school of illumination, which was connected with that of\r\nFlanders, there is little to be said. Judging from existing examples,\r\nthe art was generally of a more rustic and coarser type. There are,\r\nhowever, exceptions. A MS. in the British Museum (King's MS. 5) of the\r\nbeginning of the 15th century contains scenes from the life of Christ in\r\nwhich the features are carefully modelled, very much after the style of\r\nEnglish work of the same time; and some of the specimens of Dutch work\r\nin _camaïeu gris_ are excellent.\r\n\r\nGerman illumination in the 15th century appears to have largely copied\r\nthe Flemish style; but it lost the finer qualities of its pattern, and\r\nin decoration it inclined to extravagance. Where the Flemish artist was\r\ncontent with single flowers gracefully placed, the German filled his\r\nborders with straggling plants and foliage and with large flourished\r\nscrolls.\r\n\r\nItalian illumination, which had developed so rapidly in the 14th\r\ncentury, now advanced with accelerated pace and expanded into a variety\r\nof styles, more or less local, culminating in the exquisite productions\r\nof the classical renaissance in the latter half of the 15th century. As\r\nin the other national styles of France and Flanders, the Italian\r\nminiaturist quickly abandoned the conventional for the natural\r\nlandscape; but with more character both in the figure-drawing and in the\r\nactual representation of scenery. The colouring is brilliant, not of the\r\nsoftness of the Flemish school, but of stronger and harder body; the\r\noutlines are firm and crisp and details well delineated. The Florentine,\r\nthe Lombard, the Venetian, the Neapolitan and other schools flourished;\r\nand, though they borrowed details from each other, each had something\r\ndistinctive in its scheme of colouring. The border developed on several\r\nlines. The rayed gold spots or studs or pellets, which were noticed in\r\nthe 14th century, are now grouped in profusion along the margins and in\r\nthe interstices of delicate flowering and other designs. Another\r\nfavourite detail in the composition of both initials and borders was the\r\ntwining vine tendril, generally in white or gold upon a coloured ground,\r\napparently a revival of the interlacing Lombardic work of the 11th and\r\n12th centuries. At first, restrained and not too complex, it fills the\r\nbody of initials and short borders; then it rapidly expands, and the\r\nconvolutions and interlacings become more and more elaborate. Lastly\r\ncame the completed solid frame into which are introduced arabesques,\r\nvignettes, candelabras, trophies, vases, medallions, antique gems,\r\ncupids, fawns, birds, &c., and all that the fancy led by the spirit of\r\nclassical renaissance could suggest. Among the principal Italian MSS. of\r\nthe 15th century in the British Museum there are: a copy of _Plutarch's\r\nLives_, with miniatures in a remarkable style (Add. MS. 22,318);\r\nAristotle's _Ethics_, translated into Spanish by Charles, prince of\r\nViana, probably executed in Sicily about 1458 (Add. MS. 21,120); a\r\nbreviary of Santa Croce at Florence, late in the century (Add. MS.\r\n29,735); Livy's _History of the Macedonian War_, of the Neapolitan\r\nschool, late in the century (Harl. MS. 3694); and, above all, the\r\nremarkable Book of Hours of Bona Sforza of Savoy of about the year 1490\r\n(Add. MS. 34,291); besides a fair number of MSS. exhibiting the rich\r\ncolouring of the Venetian school.\r\n\r\nLike that of the French and Flemish schools, Italian illumination\r\nsurvived into the 16th century, and for a time showed vigour. Very\r\nelaborate borders of the classical type and of good design were still\r\nproduced. But, as in other countries, it was then a dying art. The\r\nattempt to graft illumination on to books produced by the printing\r\npress, which were now displacing the hand-written volumes with which the\r\nart had always been associated, proved, except in a few rare instances,\r\na failure. The experiment did not succeed; and the art was dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Spain.\r\n\r\nIt remains to say a few words respecting the book ornamentation of the\r\nPeninsula. In the earlier centuries of the middle ages there appears to\r\nhave been scarcely anything worthy of note. The Mozarabic liturgies and\r\nbiblical MSS. of the 9th to 12th centuries are adorned with initial\r\nletters closely allied to the primitive specimens of the Merovingian and\r\nFranco-Lombardic pattern, and coloured with the same crude tints; the\r\nlarger letters also being partly composed of interlaced designs. But the\r\nstyle is barbaric. Such illustrative drawings as are to be found are\r\nalso of a most primitive character. Moorish influence is apparent in the\r\ncolours, particularly in the yellows, reds and blacks. In the later\r\nmiddle ages no national school of illumination was developed, owing to\r\npolitical conditions. When in the 15th century a demand arose for\r\nilluminated MSS., recourse was had to foreign artists. Flemish art\r\nnaturally was imported, and French art on the one side and Italian art\r\non the other accompanied it. In the breviary executed for Queen Isabella\r\nof Spain about the year 1497 (Brit. Mus., Add. MS. 18,851) we find a\r\ncurious random association of miniatures and borders in both the French\r\nand the Flemish styles, the national taste for black, however, asserting\r\nitself in the borders where, in many instances, the usual coloured\r\ndesigns are replaced by black-tinted foliage and scrolls.\r\n\r\nIn other outlying countries of Europe the art of illumination can\r\nscarcely be said to have existed. In Slavonic countries a recollection\r\nof the Byzantine school lingered in book ornamentation, but chiefly in a\r\ndegraded and extravagant system of fantastic interlacings. In the 16th\r\ncentury there was a revival in Russia of the Byzantine style, and the\r\nhead-pieces and other ornamental details of the 11th and 12th centuries\r\nwere successfully imitated.\r\n\r\nThe consideration of oriental art does not come within the scope of this\r\narticle. It may, however, be noted that in Arabic and Persian MSS. of\r\nthe 13th to 16th centuries there are many examples of exquisitely drawn\r\ntitle-pages and other ornament of intricate detail, resplendent with\r\ncolour and gold, which may be ranked with western illuminations.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--Medieval and later works dealing in part with the\r\n  technicalities of illumination are collected by Mrs Merrifield,\r\n  _Original Treatises dating from the 12th to 18th Centuries on the Art\r\n  of Painting_ (1849); see also Theophilus, _De diversis Artibus_, ed.\r\n  R.

T.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nILLUMINATI (Lat. _illuminare_), a designation in use from the 15th\r\ncentury, and applied to, or assumed by, enthusiasts of types distinct\r\nfrom each other, according as the \"light\" claimed was viewed as directly\r\ncommunicated from a higher source, or as due to a clarified and exalted\r\ncondition of the human intelligence. To the former class belong the\r\n_alumbrados_ of Spain. Menendez Pelayo first finds the name about 1492\r\n(in the form _aluminados_, 1498), but traces them back to a Gnostic\r\norigin, and thinks their views were promoted in Spain through influences\r\nfrom Italy. One of their earliest leaders, born in Salamanca, a\r\nlabourer's daughter, known as La Beata de Piedrahita, came under the\r\nnotice of the Inquisition in 1511, as claiming to hold colloquies with\r\nour Lord and the Virgin; having high patrons, no decision was taken\r\nagainst her (_Los Heterodoxos Españoles_, 1881, lib. v.). Ignatius\r\nLoyola, while studying at Salamanca (1527) was brought before an\r\necclesiastical commission on a charge of sympathy with the _alumbrados_,\r\nbut escaped with an admonition. Others were not so fortunate. In 1529 a\r\ncongregation of unlettered adherents at Toledo was visited with\r\nscourging and imprisonment. Greater rigours followed, and for about a\r\ncentury the _alumbrados_ afforded many victims to the Inquisition,\r\nespecially at Cordova. The movement (under the name of _Illuminés_)\r\nseems to have reached France from Seville in 1623, and attained some\r\nproportions in Picardy when joined (1634) by Pierre Guérin, curé of\r\nSaint-Georges de Roye, whose followers, known as Guérinets, were\r\nsuppressed in 1635 (Hermant, _Hist. des hérésies_, 1717). Another and\r\nobscure body of _Illuminés_ came to light in the south of France in\r\n1722, and appears to have lingered till 1794, having affinities with\r\nthose known contemporaneously in this country as \"French Prophets,\" an\r\noffshoot of the Camisards. Of different class were the so-called\r\nIlluminati, better known as Rosicrucians, who claimed to originate in\r\n1422, but rose into notice in 1537; a secret society, combining with the\r\nmysteries of alchemy the possession of esoteric principles of religion.\r\nTheir positions are embodied in three anonymous treatises of 1614\r\n(Richard et Giraud, _Dict. de la théol. cath._). A short-lived movement\r\nof republican freethought, to whose adherents the name Illuminati was\r\ngiven, was founded on May-day 1776 by Adam Weishaupt (d. 1830),\r\nprofessor of Canon Law at Ingolstadt, an ex-Jesuit. The chosen title of\r\nthis Order or Society was Perfectibilists (_Perfektibilisten_). Its\r\nmembers, pledged to obedience to their superiors, were divided into\r\nthree main classes; the first including \"novices,\" \"minervals\" and\r\n\"lesser illuminati\"; the second consisting of freemasons, \"ordinary,\"\r\n\"Scottish\" and \"Scottish knights\"; the third or \"mystery\" class\r\ncomprising two grades of \"priest\" and \"regent\" and of \"magus\" and\r\n\"king.\" Relations with masonic lodges were established at Munich and\r\nFreising in 1780. The order had its branches in most countries of the\r\nEuropean continent, but its total numbers never seem to have exceeded\r\ntwo thousand. The scheme had its attraction for literary men, such as\r\nGoethe and Herder, and even for the reigning dukes of Gotha and Weimar.\r\nInternal rupture preceded its downfall, which was effected by an edict\r\nof the Bavarian government in 1785. Later, the title Illuminati was\r\ngiven to the French Martinists, founded in 1754 by Martinez Pasqualis,\r\nand to their imitators, the Russian Martinists, headed about 1790 by\r\nProfessor Schwartz of Moscow; both were Cabalists and allegorists,\r\nimbibing ideas from Jakob Boehme and Emmanuel Swedenborg (Bergier,\r\n_Dict. de théol._).\r\n\r\n  See (especially for details of the movement of Weishaupt,) P.\r\n  Tschackert, in Hauck's _Realencyklopädie_ (1901).     (A. Go.*)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nILLUMINATION, in optics, the intensity of the light falling upon a\r\nsurface. The measurement of the illumination is termed photometry\r\n(q.v.). The fundamental law of illumination is that if the medium be\r\ntransparent the intensity of illumination which a luminous point can\r\nproduce on a surface directly exposed to it is inversely as the square\r\nof the distance. The word transparent implies that no light is absorbed\r\nor stopped. Whatever, therefore, leaves the source of light must in\r\nsuccession pass through each of a series of spherical surfaces described\r\nround the source as centre. The same _amount_ of light falls\r\nperpendicularly on all these surfaces in succession. The amount received\r\nin a given time by a unit of surface on each is therefore inversely as\r\nthe number of such units in each. But the surfaces of spheres are as the\r\nsquares of their radii,--whence the proposition. (We assume here that\r\nthe velocity of light is constant, and that the source gives out its\r\nlight uniformly.) When the rays fall otherwise than perpendicularly on\r\nthe surface, the illumination produced is proportional to the cosine of\r\nthe angle of obliquity; for the area seen under a given spherical angle\r\nincreases as the secant of the obliquity, the distance remaining the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\nAs a corollary to this we have the further proposition that the apparent\r\nbrightness of a luminous surface (seen through a transparent homogeneous\r\nmedium) is the same at all distances.\r\n\r\nThe word brightness is here taken as a measure of the amount of light\r\nfalling on the pupil per unit of spherical angle subtended by the\r\nluminous surface. The spherical angle subtended by any small surface\r\nwhose plane is at right angles to the line of sight is inversely as the\r\nsquare of the distance. So also is the light received from it. Hence the\r\nbrightness is the same at all distances.\r\n\r\nThe word brightness is often used (even scientifically) in another sense\r\nfrom that just defined. Thus we speak of a bright star, of the\r\nquestion--When is Venus at its brightest? &c. Strictly, such expressions\r\nare not defensible except for sources of light which (like a star) have\r\nno apparent surface, so that we cannot tell from what amount of\r\nspherical angle their light appears to come. In that case the spherical\r\nangle is, for want of knowledge, assumed to be the same for all, and\r\ntherefore the brightness of each is now estimated in terms of the\r\n_whole_ quantity of light we receive from it.\r\n\r\nThe function of a telescope is to increase the \"apparent magnitude\" of\r\ndistant objects; it does not increase the \"apparent brightness.\" If we\r\nput out of account the loss of light by reflection at glass surfaces (or\r\nby imperfect reflection at metallic surfaces) and by absorption, and\r\nsuppose that the magnifying power does not exceed the ratio of the\r\naperture of the object-glass to that of the pupil, under which condition\r\nthe pupil will be filled with light, we may say that the \"apparent\r\nbrightness\" is absolutely unchanged by the use of a telescope. In this\r\nstatement, however, two reservations must be admitted. If the object\r\nunder examination, like a fixed star, have no sensible apparent\r\nmagnitude, the conception of \"apparent brightness\" is altogether\r\ninapplicable, and we are concerned only with the total quantity of light\r\nreaching the eye. Again, it is found that the visibility of an object\r\nseen against a black background depends not only upon the \"apparent\r\nbrightness\" but also upon the apparent magnitude. If two or three\r\ncrosses of different sizes be cut out of the same piece of white paper,\r\nand be erected against a black background on the further side of a\r\nnearly dark room, the smaller ones become invisible in a light still\r\nsufficient to show the larger. Under these circumstances a suitable\r\ntelescope may of course bring also the smaller objects into view. The\r\nexplanation is probably to be sought in imperfect action of the lens of\r\nthe eye when the pupil is dilated to the utmost. Lord Rayleigh found\r\nthat in a nearly dark room he became distinctly short-sighted, a defect\r\nof which there is no trace whatever in a moderate light. If this view be\r\ncorrect, the brightness of the image on the retina is really less in the\r\ncase of a small than in the case of a large object, although the\r\nso-called apparent brightnesses may be the same. However this may be,\r\nthe utility of a night-glass is beyond dispute.\r\n\r\nThe general law that (apart from the accidental losses mentioned above)\r\nthe \"apparent brightness\" depends only upon the area of the pupil filled\r\nwith light, though often ill understood, has been established for a long\r\ntime, as the following quotation from Smith's _Optics_ (Cambridge,\r\n1738), p. 113, will show:--\r\n\r\n  \"Since the magnitude of the pupil is subject to be varied by various\r\n  degrees of light, let NO be its semi-diameter when the object PL is\r\n  viewed by the naked eye from the distance OP; and upon a plane that\r\n  touches the eye at O, let OK be the semi-diameter of the greatest\r\n  area, visible through all the glasses to another eye at P, to be found\r\n  as PL was; or, which is the same thing, let OK be the semi-diameter of\r\n  the greatest area inlightened by a pencil of rays flowing from P\r\n  through all the glasses; and when this area is not less than the area\r\n  of the pupil, the point P will appear just as bright through all the\r\n  glasses as it would do if they were removed; but if the inlightened\r\n  area be less than the area of the pupil, the point P will appear less\r\n  bright through the glasses than if they were removed in the same\r\n  proportion as the inlightened area is less than the pupil. And these\r\n  proportions of apparent brightness would be accurate if all the\r\n  incident rays were transmitted through the glasses to the eye, or if\r\n  only an insensible part of them were stopt.\"\r\n\r\nA very important fact connected with our present subject is: The\r\nbrightness of a self-luminous surface does not depend upon its\r\ninclination to the line of sight. Thus a red-hot ball of iron, free from\r\nscales of oxide, &c., appears flat in the dark; so, also, the sun, seen\r\nthrough mist, appears as a flat disk. This fact, however, depends\r\nultimately upon the second law of thermodynamics (see RADIATION). It may\r\nbe stated, however, in another form, in which its connexion with what\r\nprecedes is more obvious--The amount of radiation, in any direction,\r\nfrom a luminous surface is proportional to the cosine of the obliquity.\r\n\r\n  The flow of light (if we may so call it) in straight lines from the\r\n  luminous point, with constant velocity, leads, as we have seen, to the\r\n  expression [mu]r^(-2) (where r is the distance from the luminous\r\n  point) for the quantity of light which passes through unit of surface\r\n  perpendicular to the ray in unit of time, [mu] being a quantity\r\n  indicating the rate at which light is emitted by the source. This\r\n  represents the illumination of the surface on which it falls. The flow\r\n  through unit of surface whose normal is inclined at an angle [theta]\r\n  to the ray is of course [mu]r^(-2) cos [theta], again representing the\r\n  illumination. These are precisely the expressions for the gravitation\r\n  force exerted by a particle of mass [mu] on a unit of matter at\r\n  distance r, and for its resolved part in a given direction. Hence we\r\n  may employ an expression V = [Sigma][mu]r^(-1), which is exactly\r\n  analogous to the gravitation or electric potential, for the purpose of\r\n  calculating the effect due to any number of separate sources of light.\r\n\r\n  And the fundamental proposition in potentials, viz. that, if n be the\r\n  external normal at any point of a closed surface, the integral\r\n  [int][int](dV/dn)dS, taken over the whole surface, has the\r\n  value--4[pi][mu]0, where [mu]0 is the sum of the values of [mu] for\r\n  each source lying within the surface, follows almost intuitively from\r\n  the mere consideration of what it means as regards light. For every\r\n  source external to the closed surface sends in light which goes out\r\n  again. But the light from an internal source goes wholly out; and the\r\n  amount per second from each unit source is 4[pi], the total area of\r\n  the unit sphere surrounding the source.\r\n\r\n  It is well to observe, however, that the analogy is not quite\r\n  complete. To make it so, all the sources must lie on the same side of\r\n  the surface whose illumination we are dealing with. This is due to the\r\n  fact that, in order that a surface may be illuminated at all, it must\r\n  be capable of scattering light, i.e. it must be to some extent opaque.\r\n  Hence the illumination depends mainly upon those sources which are on\r\n  the same side as that from which it is regarded.\r\n\r\n  Though this process bears some resemblance to the heat analogy\r\n  employed by Lord Kelvin (Sir W. Thomson) for investigations in\r\n  statical electricity and to Clerk Maxwell's device of an\r\n  incompressible fluid without mass, it is by no means identical with\r\n  them. Each method deals with a substance, real or imaginary, which\r\n  flows in conical streams from a source so that the same amount of it\r\n  passes per second through every section of the cone. But in the\r\n  present process the velocity is constant and the density variable,\r\n  while in the others the density is virtually constant and the velocity\r\n  variable. There is a curious reciprocity in formulae such as we have\r\n  just given. For instance, it is easily seen that the light received\r\n  from a uniformly illuminated surface is represented by\r\n  [int][int]r^(-2) cos [theta] dS.\r\n\r\n  As we have seen that this integral vanishes for a closed surface which\r\n  has no source inside, its value is the same for all shells of equal\r\n  uniform brightness whose edges lie on the same cone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATION. In a general sense, illustration (or the art of\r\nrepresenting pictorially some idea which has been expressed in words) is\r\nas old as Art itself. There has never been a time since civilization\r\nbegan when artists were not prompted to pictorial themes from legendary,\r\nhistorical or literary sources. But the art of illustration, as now\r\nunderstood, is a comparatively modern product. The tendency of modern\r\nculture has been to make the interests of the different arts overlap.\r\nThe theory of Wagner, as applied to opera, for making a combined appeal\r\nto the artistic emotions, has been also the underlying principle in the\r\ndevelopment of that great body of artistic production which in painting\r\ngives us the picture containing \"literary\" elements, and, in actual\r\nassociation with literature in its printed form, becomes what we call\r\n\"illustration.\" The illustrator's work is the complement of expression\r\nin some other medium. A poem can hardly exist which does not awaken in\r\nthe mind at some moment a suggestion either of picture or music. The\r\nsensitive temperament of the artist or the musician is able to realize\r\nout of words some parallel idea which can only be conveyed, or can be\r\nbest conveyed, through his own medium of music or painting. Similarly,\r\nmusic or painting may, and often does, suggest poetry. It is from this\r\ninter-relation of the emotions governing the different arts that\r\nillustration may be said to spring. The success of illustration lies,\r\nthen, in the instinctive transference of an idea from one medium to\r\nanother; the more spontaneous it be and the less laboured in\r\napplication, the better.\r\n\r\nLeaving on one side the illuminated manuscripts of the middle ages (see\r\nILLUMINATED MSS.) we start with the fact that illustration was\r\ncoincident with the invention of printing. Italian art produced many\r\nfine examples, notably the outline illustrations to the _Poliphili\r\nHypneratomachia_, printed by Aldus at Venice in the last year of the\r\n15th century. Other early works exist, the products of unnamed artists\r\nof the French, German, Spanish and Italian schools; while of more\r\nsingular importance, though not then brought into book form, were the\r\nillustrations to Dante's _Divine Comedy_ made by Botticelli at about the\r\nsame period. The sudden development of engraving on metal and wood drew\r\nmany painters of the Renaissance towards illustration as a further\r\nopportunity for the exercise of their powers; and the line-work, either\r\noriginal or engraved by others, of Pollajuolo, Mantegna, Michelangelo\r\nand Titian has its place in the gradual enlargement of illustrative art.\r\nThe German school of the 16th century committed its energies even more\r\nvigorously to illustration; and many of its artists are now known\r\nchiefly through their engravings on wood or copper, a good proportion of\r\nwhich were done to the accompaniment of printed matter. The names of\r\nDürer, Burgmair, Altdorfer and Holbein represent a school whose engraved\r\nillustrations possess qualities which have never been rivalled, and\r\nremain an invaluable aid to imitators of the present day.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Progress in England.\r\n\r\nIllustration has generally flourished in any particular age in\r\nproportion to the health and vigour of the artistic productions in other\r\nkinds. No evident revival in painting has come about, no great school\r\nhas existed during the last four centuries, which has not set its mark\r\nupon the illustration of the period and quickened it into a medium for\r\ntrue artistic expression. The etchers of the Low Countries during the\r\n17th century, with Rembrandt at their head, were to a great extent\r\nillustrators in their choice of subjects. In France the period of\r\nWatteau and Fragonard gave rise to a school of delicately engraved\r\nillustration, exquisite in detail and invention. In England Hogarth came\r\nto be the founder of many new conditions, both in painting and\r\nillustration, and was followed by men of genius so distinct as Reynolds\r\non the one side and Bewick on the other. With Reynolds one connects the\r\nillustrators and engravers for whom now Bartolozzi supplies a surviving\r\nname and an embodiment in his graceful but never quite English art. But\r\nit is from Thomas Bewick that the wonderfully consistent development of\r\nEnglish illustration begins to date. Bewick marks an important period in\r\nthe technical history of wood-engraving as the practical inventor of the\r\n\"tint\" and \"white line\" method of wood-cutting; but he also happened to\r\nbe an artist. His artistic device was to give local colour and texture\r\nwithout shadow, securing thereby a precision of outline which allowed no\r\nform to be lost. And though, in consequence, many of his best designs\r\nhave somewhat the air of a specimen plate, he succeeded in bringing into\r\nblack-and-white illustration an element of colour which had been wholly\r\nabsent from it in the work of the 15th and 16th century German and\r\nItalian schools. Bewick's method started a new school; but the more racy\r\nqualities of his woodcuts were entirely dependent on the designer being\r\nhis own cutter; and the same happy relationship gave distinct\r\ncharacteristics to the nearly contemporary work of William Blake and of\r\nCalvert. Blake's wonderful _Illustrations to the Book of Job_, while\r\nmagnificent in their conventional rendering of light and shade, still\r\nretain the colourlessness of the old masters, as do also the more\r\nbroadly handled designs to his own books of prophecy and verse; but in\r\nhis woodcuts to Philips's _Pastorals_ the modern tendency towards local\r\ncolour makes itself strongly felt. So wonderfully, indeed, have colour\r\nand tone been expressed in these rough wood-blocks, that more vivid\r\nimpressions of darkness and twilight falling across quiet landscape have\r\nnever been produced through the same materials. The pastoral designs\r\nmade by Edward Calvert on similar lines can hardly be over-praised.\r\nTechnically these engravings are far more able than those from which\r\nthey drew their inspiration.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the two artists named, and in a minor degree of\r\nThomas Stothard and John Flaxman, who also produced original\r\nillustrations, the period from the end of the 18th century till about\r\nthe middle of the 19th was less notable for the work of the designer\r\nthan of the engraver. The delicate plates to Rogers's _Italy_ were done\r\nfrom drawings which Turner had not produced for purposes of\r\nillustration; and the admirable lithographs of Samuel Prout and Richard\r\nBonington were merely studies of architecture and landscape made in a\r\nmaterial that admitted of indefinite multiplication. It is true that\r\nGéricault came over to England about the year 1820 to draw the English\r\nrace-horse and other studies of country life, which were published in\r\nLondon in 1821, and that other fine work in lithography was done by\r\nJames Ward, G. Cattermole, and somewhat later by J. F. Lewis. But\r\nillustration proper, subject-illustration applied to literature, was\r\nmainly in the hands of the wood-engravers; and these, forming a really\r\nfine school founded on the lines which Bewick had laid down, had for\r\nabout thirty years to content themselves with rendering the works of\r\nephemeral artists, among whom Benjamin R. Haydon and John Martin stand\r\nout as the chief lights. It must not be forgotten, however, that while\r\nthe day of a serious English school of illustration had not yet come,\r\nGreat Britain possessed an indigenous tradition of gross and lively\r\ncaricature; a tradition of such robust force and vulgarity that, by the\r\nside of some choicer specimens of James Gillray and Henry W. Bunbury,\r\nthe art of Rowlandson appears almost refined. This was the school in\r\nwhich George Cruikshank, John Leech, and the Dickens illustrators had\r\ntheir training, from which they drew more and more away; until, with the\r\nhelp of _Punch_, just before the middle of the 19th century, English\r\ncaricaturists had learned the secret of how to be apposite and amusing\r\nwithout scurrility and without libel. (See CARICATURE.)\r\n\r\n\r\n  Influence of Wood-engraving.\r\n\r\nUnder NEWSPAPERS will be found some account of the rise of _illustrated\r\njournalism_. It was in about the year 1832 that the illustrated weekly\r\npaper started on its career in England, and almost by accident\r\ndetermined under what form a great national art was to develop itself.\r\nWhile in France the illustrators were making their triumphs by means of\r\nlithography, English illustration was becoming more and more identified\r\nwith wood-engraving. The demand for a method of illustration, easy to\r\nproduce and easy to print, for books and magazines of large circulation\r\nand moderate price, forced the artist before long into drawing upon the\r\nwood itself; and so soon as the artist had asserted his preference for\r\nfacsimile over \"tint,\" the school which came to be called \"of the\r\n'sixties\" was in embryo, and waited only for artistic power to give it\r\ndistinction. The engraver's translation of the artist's painting or\r\nwash-drawing into \"tint\" had largely exalted the individuality of the\r\nengraver at the expense of the artist. But from the moment when the\r\ndesigner began to put his own lines upon the wood, new conditions shaped\r\nthemselves; and though the artist at times might make demands which the\r\nengraver could not follow, or the engraver inadequately fulfil the\r\nexpectation of the artist, the general tendency was to bring designer\r\nand engraver into almost ideal relations--an ideal which nothing short\r\nof the artist being his own engraver could have equalled. Out of an\r\nalliance cemented by their common use and understanding of the material\r\non which they worked came the school of facsimile or partial-facsimile\r\nengraving which flourished during the 'sixties, and lasted just so long\r\nas its conditions were unimpaired--losing its flavour only at the moment\r\nwhen \"improved\" mechanical appliances enabled the artist once more to\r\ndissociate himself from the conditions which bound the engraver in his\r\ncraft.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Pre-Raphaelite movement.\r\n\r\n  Influence of Millais.\r\n\r\nBefore the fortunate circumstances which governed the work of the\r\n'sixties became decisive, illustrations of a transitional character, but\r\ntending to the same end, had been produced by John Tenniel, John\r\nGilbert, Birket Foster, Harrison Weir, T. Creswick, W. Mulready and\r\nothers; but their methods were too vague and diffuse to bear as yet the\r\nmark of a school; no single influence gave a unity to their efforts. On\r\nsome of them Adolf von Menzel's illustrations to Kügler's _Frederick the\r\nGreat_, published in England in 1844, may have left a mark; Gilbert\r\ncertainly shows traces of the influence of Delacroix and Bonington in\r\nthe free, loose method of his draughtsmanship, independent of accurate\r\nmodelling, and with here and there a paint-like dab of black to relieve\r\na generally colourless effect; while Tenniel, with cold, precise lines\r\nof wire-drawn hardness, remained the representative of the past academic\r\nstyle, influencing others by the dignity of his fine technique, but with\r\nhis own feeling quite untouched by the Pre-Raphaelite and romantic\r\nmovement which was soon to occupy the world of illustration. In greater\r\nor less degree it may be said of the work of all these artists that, as\r\nit antedates, so to the end does it stand somewhat removed in character\r\nfrom, the school with which for a time it became contemporary. The year\r\nwhich decisively marked the beginning of new things in illustration was\r\n1857, the year of the Moxon _Tennyson_ and of Wilmott's _Poets of the\r\nNineteenth Century_, with illustrations by Rossetti, Millais, Holman\r\nHunt and Ford Madox Brown. In these artists we get the germ of the\r\nmovement which afterwards came to have so wide a popularity. At the\r\nbeginning, Pre-Raphaelite in name, poetic and literary in its choice of\r\nsubjects, the school quickly expanded to an acceptance of those open-air\r\nand everyday subjects which one connects with the names of Frederick\r\nWalker, Arthur B. Houghton, G. F. Pinwell and M. North. The\r\nillustrations of the Pre-Raphaelites were eminently thoughtful, full of\r\nsymbolism, and with a certain pressure of interest to which the epithet\r\nof \"intense\" came to be applied. As an example of their method of\r\nthought-transference from word to form, Madox Brown's drawing for the\r\nDalziel Bible of \"Elijah and the Widow's Son\" may be taken. The\r\nrestoration of life to a dead body, of a child to its mother, is there\r\nconveyed with many illustrative touches and asides, which become clumsy\r\nwhen stated in words. The hen bearing her chicken between her wings is a\r\nperfectly direct and appropriate pictorial symbol, but a far more\r\nimaginative stroke is the shadow on the wall of a swallow flying back to\r\nthe clay bottle where it has made its nest. Here is illustration full of\r\nliterary symbolism, yet wholly pictorial in its means; and in this it is\r\nentirely characteristic of Pre-Raphaelite feeling, with its method of\r\nsuggesting, through externals, consideration as opposed to mere outlook.\r\nOf this phase Rossetti must be accounted the leader, but it was Millais\r\nwho, by the sheer weight of his personality, carried English\r\nillustration along with him from Pre-Raphaelitism to the freer\r\nromanticism and naturalistic tendencies of the 'sixties. Rossetti, with\r\nhis poetic enthusiasm, his strong personal magnetism and dramatic power\r\nof composition, may be said to have brought about the awakening; it was\r\nMillais who, by his rapid development of style, his original and daring\r\ntechnique, turned it into a movement. When he started, there were many\r\ninfluences behind him and his fellow-workers--among older foreign\r\ncontemporaries, those of Menzel and Rethel; and behind these again\r\nsomething of the old masters. But through a transitional period,\r\nrepresented by his twelve drawings of \"The Parables,\" which appeared\r\nfirst in _Good Words_, Millais emerged in to the perfect independence of\r\nhis illustrations to Trollope's novels, _Framley Parsonage_, and _The_\r\n_Small House at Allington_, his own master and the master of a new\r\nschool. Depicting the ugly fashions of his day with grave dignity and\r\ndistinction, and with a broad power of rendering type in work which had\r\nthe aspect of genre, he drew the picture of his age in a summary so\r\nembracing that his illustrations attain the rank almost of historical\r\nart. For art of this sort the symbolism of the Pre-Raphaelites lost its\r\nuse: the realization in form of a character conveyed by an author's\r\nwords, the happy suggestion of a locality helping to fix the writer's\r\ndescription, the verisimilitudes of ordinary life, even to trivial\r\ndetail, carried out with real pictorial conviction, were the things most\r\nto be aimed at. Pictorial conviction was the great mark of the\r\nillustrative school of the 'sixties. The work of its artists has\r\nabsorbed so completely the interest and reality of the letterpress that\r\nthe results are a model of what faithful yet imaginative illustration\r\nshould be. In the illustrated magazines of this period, _Once a Week_,\r\n_Good Words_, _Cornhill_, _London Society_, _The Argosy_, _The Leisure\r\nHour_, _Sunday at Home_, _The Quiver_ and _The Churchman's Family\r\nMagazine_, as well as others, is to be found the best work of this new\r\nschool of illustrators; and with the greater number of them it cannot be\r\nmistaken that Millais is the prevailing force.\r\n\r\nBy their side other men were working, more deeply influenced by the old\r\nmasters, and by the minuteness and hard, definite treatment of form\r\nwhich the Pre-Raphaelite school had inculcated. Foremost of these was\r\nFrederick Sandys. His illustrations, scattered through nearly all the\r\nmagazines which have been named, show always a decorative power of\r\ndesign and are full of fine drawing and fine invention, but remain\r\nresolutely cold in handling and lacking in imaginative ardour. The few\r\nillustrations done by Burne-Jones at this period show a whole-hearted\r\nfollowing of Rossetti, but a somewhat struggling technique; and the same\r\nqualities are to be found in the work of Arthur Hughes, whose\r\nillustrations in _Good Words for the Young_ (1869) have a charm of\r\ntender poetic invention showing through the faults and persistent\r\nuncertainty of his draughtsmanship. The illustrations of Frederick\r\nShields to Defoe's _History of the Plague_ have a certain affinity to\r\nthe work of Sandys; but, with less power over form, they show a more\r\ndramatic sense of light and shade, and at their best can claim real and\r\noriginal beauty. The formality of feeling and composition, and the\r\nstrained, stiff quality of line in Lord Leighton's designs to _Romola_\r\n(1863), do a good deal to mar one's enjoyment of their admirable\r\ndraughtsmanship. Many fine drawings done at this period by Leighton,\r\nPoynter, Henry Armstead and Burne-Jones did not appear until the year\r\n1880 in the \"Dalziel Bible Gallery,\" when the methods of which they were\r\nthe outcome had fallen almost out of use.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"The 'sixties.\"\r\n\r\nDeeply influenced by the broad later phases of Millais's black-and-white\r\nwork were those artists whose tendency lay in the direction of idyllic\r\nnaturalism and popular romance, the men to whom more particularly is\r\ngiven the name of the period and school \"the 'sixties,\" and whose more\r\nimmediate leader, as far as popular estimation goes, was Frederick\r\nWalker. With his, one may roughly group the names of Pinwell, Houghton,\r\nNorth, Charles Keene, Lawless, Matthew J. Mahoney, Morten and, with a\r\ncertain reservation, W. Small and G. du Maurier. In no very separate\r\ncategory stand two other artists whose contributions to illustration\r\nwere but incidental, John Pettie and J. M'Neill Whistler. The broad\r\ncharacteristics of this variously related group were a loose, easy line\r\nsuggestive of movement, a general fondness for white spaces and open-air\r\neffects, and in the best of them a thorough sense of the serious beauty\r\nof domestic and rural life. They treated the present with a feeling\r\nrather idyllic than realistic; when they touched the past it was with a\r\ncourteous sort of realism, and a wonderful inventiveness of detail which\r\ncarried with it a charm of conviction. Walker's method shows a broad and\r\nvivid use of black and white, with a fine sense of balance, but very\r\nlittle preoccupation for decorative effect. Pinwell had a more delicate\r\nfancy, but less freedom in his technique--less ease, but more\r\noriginality of composition. In Houghton's work one sees a swift,\r\nmasterful technique, full of audacity, noble in its economy of means,\r\nsometimes rough and careless. His temperament was dramatic, passionate,\r\nsatiric and witty. Some of his best work, his \"Scenes from American\r\nLife,\" appeared in the pages of the _Graphic_ as late as the years\r\n1873-1874. There are indications in the work of Lawless that he might\r\nhave come close to Millais in his power of infusing distinction into the\r\nbarest materials of everyday life, but he died too soon for his work to\r\nreach its full accomplishment. North was essentially a landscape\r\nillustrator. The delicate sense of beauty in du Maurier's early work\r\nbecame lost in the formal but graceful conventions of his later _Punch_\r\ndrawings. It was in the pages of _Punch_ that Keene secured his chief\r\ntriumphs. The two last-named artists outstayed the day which saw the\r\nbreak-up of the school of which these are the leading names. It ran its\r\ncourse through a period when illustrated magazines formed the staple of\r\npopular consumption, before the illustrated newspapers, with their\r\nhungry rush for the record of latest events, became a weekly feature.\r\nIts waning influence may be plainly traced through the early years of\r\nthe _Graphic_, which started in 1869 with some really fine work, done\r\nunder transitional conditions before the engraver's rendering of\r\ntone-drawings once more ousted facsimile from its high place in\r\nillustration.\r\n\r\nIn connexion with this transitional period, drawings for the _Graphic_\r\nby Houghton, Pinwell, Sir Hubert von Herkomer, E. J. Gregory, H. Woods,\r\nCharles Green, H. Paterson (Mrs Allingham) and William Small deserve\r\nhonourable mention. Yet it was the last-named who was mainly\r\ninstrumental in bringing about the change from line-work to pigment,\r\nwhich depressed the artistic value of illustration during the 'seventies\r\nand the 'eighties to almost absolute mediocrity. Several artists of\r\ngreat ability practised illustration during this period: in addition to\r\nthose _Graphic_ artists already mentioned there were Luke Fildes, Frank\r\nHoll, S. P. Hall, Paul Renouard and a few others of smaller merit. But\r\nthe interest was for the time shifting from black-and-white work and\r\nturning to colour. Kate Greenaway began to produce her charming idyllic\r\nrenderings of children in mob-caps and long skirts. Walter Crane on\r\nsomewhat similar lines designed his illustrated nursery rhymes; while\r\nRandolph Caldecott took the field with his fresh and breezy scenes of\r\nhunting life and carousal in the times most typical of the English\r\nsquirearchy. Working with a broad outline, suggestive of the brush by\r\nits easy freedom, and adding washes of conventional colour for\r\nembellishment, he was one of the first in England to show the beginnings\r\nof Japanese influence. Even more dependent upon colour were his\r\nillustrated books for children; while in black and white, in his\r\nillustrations to _Bracebridge Hall_ (1876), for instance, pen and ink\r\nbegan to replace the pencil, and to produce a new and more independent\r\nstyle of draughtsmanship. This style was taken up and followed by many\r\nartists of ability, by Harry Furniss, Hugh Thomson and others, till the\r\ninfluence of E. A. Abbey's more mobile and more elaborate penmanship\r\ncame to produce a still further development in the direction of fineness\r\nand illusion, and that of Phil May, with Linley Sambourne for his\r\nteacher, to simplify and make broad for those who aimed rather at a\r\njournalistic and shorthand method of illustration. (See also CARICATURE\r\nand CARTOON.)\r\n\r\n  Under the absolutely liberating conditions of \"process reproduction\"\r\n  (see PROCESS) the latest developments in illustration on its lighter\r\n  and more popular side are full of French influences, or ready to\r\n  follow the wind in any fresh direction, whether to America or Japan;\r\n  but on the graver side they show a strong leaning towards the older\r\n  traditions of the 'sixties and of Pre-Raphaelitism. The founding by\r\n  William Morris of the Kelmscott Press in 1891, through which were\r\n  produced a series of decorated and illustrated books, aimed frankly at\r\n  a revival of medieval taste. In Morris's books decorative effect and\r\n  sense of material claimed mastery over the whole scheme, and subdued\r\n  the illustrations to a sort of glorious captivity into which no breath\r\n  of modern spirit could be breathed. The illustrations of Burne-Jones\r\n  filled with a happy touch of archaism the decorative borders of\r\n  William Morris; and only a little less happy, apart from their\r\n  imaginative inferiority, were the serious efforts of Walter Crane and\r\n  one or two others. Directly under the Morris influence arose the\r\n  \"Birmingham school,\" with an entire devotion to decorative methods and\r\n  still archaic effects which tended sometimes to rather inane\r\n  technical results. Among its leaders may be named Arthur Gaskin, C. M.\r\n  Gere and E. H. New; while work not dissimilar but more independent in\r\n  spirit had already been done by Selwyn Image and H. P. Horne in the\r\n  _Century Guild Hobby-Horse_. But far greater originality and force\r\n  belonged to the work of a group, known for a time as the\r\n  neo-Pre-Raphaelites, which joined to an earnest study of the past a\r\n  scrupulously open mind towards more modern influences. Its earliest\r\n  expression of existence was the publication of an occasional\r\n  periodical, the _Dial_ (1889-1897), but before long its influence\r\n  became felt outside its first narrow limits. The technical influence\r\n  of Abbey, but still more the emotional and intellectual teaching of\r\n  Rossetti and Millais, together with side-influences from the few great\r\n  French symbolists, were, apart from their own originality, the forces\r\n  which gave distinction to the work of C. S. Ricketts, C. H. Shannon,\r\n  R. Savage and their immediate following. Beauty of line, languorous\r\n  passion, symbolism full of literary allusions, and a fondness for the\r\n  life of any age but the present, are the characteristics of the\r\n  school. Their influence fell very much in the same quarters where\r\n  Morris found a welcome; but an affinity for the Italian rather than\r\n  the German masters (shown especially in the \"Vale Press\"\r\n  publications), and a studied note of world-weariness, kept them\r\n  somewhat apart from the sturdy medievalism of Morris, and linked them\r\n  intellectually with the decadent school initiated by the wayward\r\n  genius of Aubrey Beardsley. But though broadly men may be classed in\r\n  groups, no grouping will supply a formula for all the noteworthy work\r\n  produced when men are drawn this way and that by current influences.\r\n  Among artists resolutely independent of contemporary coteries may be\r\n  named W. Strang, whose grave, rugged work shows him a pupil, through\r\n  Legros, of Dürer and others of the old masters; T. Sturge Moore, an\r\n  original engraver of designs which have an equal affinity for Blake,\r\n  Calvert and Hokusai; W. Nicholson, whose style shows a dignified\r\n  return to the best part of the Rowlandson tradition; and E. J.\r\n  Sullivan. In the closing years of the 19th century Aubrey Beardsley\r\n  became the creator of an entirely novel style of decorative\r\n  illustration. Drawing inspiration from all sources of European and\r\n  Japanese art, he produced, by the force of a vivid personality and\r\n  extraordinary technical skill, a result which was highly original and\r\n  impressive. To a genuine liking for analysis of repulsive and vicious\r\n  types of humanity he added an exquisite sense of line, balance and\r\n  mass; and partly by _succès de scandale_, partly by genuine artistic\r\n  brilliance, he gathered round him a host of imitators, to whom, for\r\n  the most part, he was able to impart only his more mediocre qualities.\r\n\r\n\r\n    United States.\r\n\r\n  In America, until a comparatively recent date, illustration bowed the\r\n  knee to the superior excellence of the engraver over the artist. Not\r\n  until the brilliant pen-drawing of E. A. Abbey carried the day with\r\n  the black-and-white artists of England did any work of real moment\r\n  emanate from the United States, unless that of Elihu Vedder be\r\n  regarded as an exception. Howard Pyle is a brilliant imitator of\r\n  Dürer; he has also the ability to adapt himself to draughtsmanship of\r\n  a more modern tendency. C. S. Reinhart was an artist of directness and\r\n  force, in a style based upon modern French and German examples; while\r\n  of greater originality as a whole, though derivative in detail, is the\r\n  fanciful penmanship of Alfred Brennan. Other artists who stand in the\r\n  front rank of American illustrators, and whose works appear chiefly in\r\n  the pages of _Scribner's_, _Harper's_ and the _Century Magazine_, are\r\n  W. T. Smedley, F. S. Church, R. Blum, Wenzell, A. B. Frost, and in\r\n  particular C. Dana Gibson, the last of whom gained a reputation in\r\n  England as an American du Maurier.\r\n\r\n\r\n    France.\r\n\r\n  The record of modern French illustration goes back to the day when\r\n  political caricature and the Napoleonic legend divided between them\r\n  the triumphs of early lithography. The illustrators of France at that\r\n  period were also her greatest artists. Of the historical and romantic\r\n  school were D. Raffet, Nicholas J. Charlet, Géricault, Delacroix, J.\r\n  B. Isabey and Achille Devéria, many of whose works appeared in\r\n  _L'Artiste_, a paper founded in 1831 as the official organ of the\r\n  romanticists; while the realists were led in the direction of\r\n  caricature by two artists of such enormous force as Gavarni and Honoré\r\n  Daumier, whose works, appearing in _La Lithographie Mensuelle_, _Le\r\n  Charivari_ and _La Caricature_, ran the gauntlet of political\r\n  interference and suppression during a troubled period of French\r\n  politics--which was the very cause of their prosperity. Behind these\r\n  men lay the influence of the great Spanish realist Goya. Following\r\n  upon the harsh satire and venomous realism of this famous school of\r\n  pictorial invective, the influence of the Barbizon school came as a\r\n  milder force; but the power of its artists did not show in the\r\n  direction of original lithography, and far more value attaches to the\r\n  few woodcuts of J. F. Millet's studies of peasant life. In these we\r\n  see clearly the tendency of French illustrative art to keep as far as\r\n  possible the authentic and sketch-like touch of the artist; and it was\r\n  no doubt from this tendency that so many of the great French\r\n  illustrators retained lithography rather than commit themselves to the\r\n  middleman engraver. Nevertheless, from about the year 1830 many French\r\n  artists produced illustrations which were interpreted upon the wood\r\n  for the most part by English engravers. Cunier's editions of _Paul et\r\n  Virginie_ and _La Chaumière Indienne_, illustrated by Huet, Jacque,\r\n  Isabey, Johannot and Meissonier, were followed by Meissonier's more\r\n  famous illustrations to _Contes rémois_. After Meissonier came J. B.\r\n  E. Detaille and Alphonse M. de Neuville and, with a voluminous style\r\n  of his own, L. A. G. Doré. By the majority of these artists the\r\n  drawing for the engraver seems to have been done with the pen; and the\r\n  tendency to penmanship was still more accentuated when from Spain came\r\n  the influence of M. J. Fortuny's brilliant technique; while after him,\r\n  again, came Daniel Vierge, to make, as it were, the point of the pen\r\n  still more pointed. During the middle period of the 19th century the\r\n  best French illustration was serious in character; but among the later\r\n  men, when we have recognized the grave beauty of Grasset's _Les Quatre\r\n  Fils d'Aymon_ (in spite of his vicious treatment of the page by\r\n  flooding washes of colour through the type itself), and the delicate\r\n  grace of Boutet de Monvel's _Jeanne d'Arc_, also in colours, it is to\r\n  the illustrators of the comic papers that we have to go for the most\r\n  typical and most audacious specimens of French art. In the pages of\r\n  _Gil Blas_, _Le Pierrot_, _L'Écho de Paris_, _Le Figaro Illustré_, _Le\r\n  Courrier Français_, and similar publications, are to be found,\r\n  reproduced with a dexterity of process unsurpassed in England, the\r\n  designs of J. L. Forain, C. L. Léandre, L. A, Willette and T. A.\r\n  Steinlen, the leaders of a school enterprising in technique, and with\r\n  a mixture of subtlety and grossness in its humour. Caran d'Ache also\r\n  became celebrated as a draughtsman of comic drama in outline.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Germany.\r\n\r\n  Among illustrators of Teutonic race the one artist who seems worthy of\r\n  comparison with the great Menzel is Hans Tegner, if, indeed, he be not\r\n  in some respects his technical superior; but apart from these two, the\r\n  illustrators respectively of Kügler's _Frederick the Great_ and\r\n  Holberg's _Comedies_, there is no German, Danish or Dutch illustrator\r\n  who can lay claim to first rank. Max Klinger, A. Böcklin, W. Trübner,\r\n  Franz Stück and Hans Thoma are all symbolists who combine in a\r\n  singular degree force with brutality; the imaginative quality in their\r\n  work is for the most part ruined by the hard, braggart way in which it\r\n  is driven home. The achievements and tendency of the later school of\r\n  illustration in Germany are best seen in the weekly illustrated\r\n  journal, _Jugend_, of Munich. Typical of an older German school is the\r\n  work of Adolf Oberländer, a solid, scientific sort of caricaturist,\r\n  whose illustrations are at times so monumental that the humour in them\r\n  seems crushed out of life. Others who command high qualities of\r\n  technique are W. Dietz, L. von Nagel, Hermann Vogel, H. Lüders and\r\n  Robert Haug. Behind all these men in greater or less degree lies the\r\n  influence of Menzel's coldly balanced and dry-lighted realism; but\r\n  wherever the influence of Menzel ceases, the merit of German\r\n  illustration for the most part tends to disappear or become mediocre.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--W.

Ho.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Technical Developments._\r\n\r\nThe history of illustration, apart from the merits of individual\r\nartists, during the period since the year 1875, is mainly that of the\r\ndevelopment of what is called Process (q.v.), the term applied to\r\nmethods of reproducing a drawing or photograph which depend on the use\r\nof some mechanical agency in the making of the block, as distinguished\r\nfrom such products of manual skill as steel or wood-engraving,\r\nlithography and the like. There is good reason to believe that the art\r\nof stereotyping--the multiplication of an already existing block by\r\nmeans of moulds and casts--is as old as the 15th century; and the early\r\nprocesses were, in a measure, a refinement upon this: with the\r\ndifference that they aimed at the making of a metal block by means of a\r\ncast of the lines of the drawing itself, the background of which had\r\nbeen cut away so as to leave the design in a definite relief.\r\nExperiments of this nature may be said to have assumed practical shape\r\nfrom the time of the invention of Palmer's process called at first\r\n_Glyphography_, about the year 1844; this was afterwards perfected and\r\nused to a considerable extent under the name of _Dawson's Typographic\r\nEtching_, and its results were in many cases quite admirable, and often\r\nappear in books and periodicals of the first part of the period with\r\nwhich we are now concerned. The _Graphic_, for instance, published its\r\nfirst process block in 1876, and the _Illustrated London News_ also made\r\nsimilar experiments at about the same time.\r\n\r\n  From this time begins the gradual application of photography to the\r\n  uses of illustration, the first successful line blocks made by its\r\n  help being probably those of Gillot, at Paris, in the early 'eighties.\r\n  The next stage was to be the invention of some means of reproducing\r\n  wash drawings. To do this it was necessary for the surface of the\r\n  block to be so broken up that every tone of the drawing should be\r\n  represented thereon by a grain holding ink enough to reproduce it.\r\n  This was finally accomplished by the insertion of a screen, in the\r\n  camera, between the lens and the plate--the effect of which was to\r\n  break up the whole surface of the negative into dots, and so secure,\r\n  when printed on a zinc plate and etched, an approximation to the\r\n  desired result. Half-tone blocks (as they were called) of this nature\r\n  (see PROCESS) were used in the _Graphic_ from 1884 and the\r\n  _Illustrated London News_ from 1885 onwards, the methods at first in\r\n  favour being those of Meisenbach and Boussod Valadon and Co.'s\r\n  phototype. Lemercier and Petit of Paris, Angerer and Göschl of Vienna,\r\n  and F. Ives of Philadelphia also perfected processes giving a similar\r\n  result, a block by the latter appearing in the _Century_ magazine as\r\n  early as 1882. Processes of this description had, however, been used\r\n  for some years before by Henry Blackburn in his _Academy Notes_.\r\n\r\n  During the decade 1875-1885, however, the main body of illustration\r\n  was accomplished by wood-engraving, which a few years earlier had\r\n  achieved such splendid results. Its artistic qualities were now at a\r\n  rather low ebb, although good facsimile engravings of pen-drawings\r\n  were not infrequent. The two great illustrated periodicals already\r\n  referred to during that period relied more upon pictorial than\r\n  journalistic work. An increasing tendency towards the illustration of\r\n  the events of the day was certainly shown, but the whole purpose of\r\n  the journal was not, as at present, subordinated thereto. The chief\r\n  illustrated magazines of the time, _Harper's_, the _Century_, the\r\n  _English Illustrated_, were also content with the older methods, and\r\n  are filled with wood-engravings, in which, if the value of the simple\r\n  line forming the chief quality of the earlier work has disappeared, a\r\n  most astonishing delicacy and success were obtained in the\r\n  reproduction of tone.\r\n\r\n  Perhaps the most notable and most characteristic production of the\r\n  time in England was colour-printing. The _Graphic_ and the\r\n  _Illustrated London News_ published full-page supplements of high\r\n  technical merit printed from wood-blocks in conjunction with metal\r\n  plates, the latter sometimes having a relief aquatint surface which\r\n  produced an effect of stipple upon the shading; metal was also used in\r\n  preference to wood for the printing of certain colours. The children's\r\n  books illustrated by Randolph Caldecott, Walter Crane and Kate\r\n  Greenaway at this time are among the finest specimens of\r\n  colour-printing yet seen outside of Japan; in them the use of flat\r\n  masses of pleasant colour in connexion with a bold and simple outline\r\n  was carried to a very high pitch of excellence. These plates were\r\n  generally printed by Edmund Evans. In 1887 the use of process was\r\n  becoming still more general; but its future was by no means adequately\r\n  foreseen, and the blocks of this and the next few years are anything\r\n  but satisfactory. This, it soon appeared, was due to inefficient\r\n  printing on the one hand, and, on the other, to a want of recognition\r\n  by artists of the special qualities of drawing most suitable for\r\n  photographic reproduction. The publication of Quevedo's _Pablo de\r\n  Segovia_ with illustrations by Daniel Vierge in 1882, although hardly\r\n  noticed at the time, was to be a revelation of the possibilities of\r\n  the new development; and a serious study of pen-drawing from this\r\n  point of view was soon inaugurated by the issue of Joseph Pennell's\r\n  _Pen Drawing and Pen Draughtsmen_ in 1889, followed in by C. G.\r\n  Harper's _English Pen Artists of To-day_ and in 1896 by Walter Crane's\r\n  _Decorative Illustration of Books_. At this time also the influence of\r\n  Aubrey Beardsley made itself strongly felt, not merely as a matter of\r\n  style, but, by the use of simple line or mass of solid black, as an\r\n  almost perfect type of the work most suitable to the needs of process.\r\n  Wider experience of printing requirements, and finer workmanship in\r\n  the actual making of the blocks, in Paris, Vienna, New York and\r\n  London, soon brought the half-tone process into great vogue. The\r\n  spread of education has enormously increased the demand for ephemeral\r\n  literature, more especially that which lends itself to pictorial\r\n  illustration; and the photograph or drawing in wash reproduced in\r\n  half-tone has of late to a great extent ousted line work from the\r\n  better class of both books and periodicals.\r\n\r\n  Improvements in machinery have made it possible to print illustrations\r\n  at a very high speed; and the facility with which photographs can now\r\n  be taken of scenes such as the public delight to see reproduced in\r\n  pictures has brought about an almost complete change in pictorial\r\n  journalism. In addition, reference must be made to an extraordinary\r\n  increase in the numbers and circulation of cheap periodical\r\n  publications depending to a very large extent for popularity on their\r\n  illustrations. Several of these, printed on the coarsest paper, from\r\n  rotary machines, sell to the extent of hundreds of thousands of copies\r\n  per week. It was inevitable that this cheapening process should not be\r\n  permitted to develop without opposition, and the _Dial_ (1889-1897)\r\n  must be looked on as a protest by the band of artists who promoted it\r\n  against the unintelligent book-making now becoming prevalent. Much\r\n  more effective and far-reaching in the same direction was the\r\n  influence of William Morris, as shown in the publications of the\r\n  Kelmscott Press (dating from 1891). In these volumes the aim was to\r\n  produce illustrations and ornaments which were of their own nature\r\n  akin to, and thus able to harmonize with the type, and to do this by\r\n  pure handicraft work. As a result, a distinct improvement is to be\r\n  found in the mere book-making of Great Britain; and although the main\r\n  force of the movement soon spent itself in somewhat uninspired\r\n  imitations, there can be no doubt of the survival of a taste for\r\n  well-produced volumes, in which the relationship of type, paper,\r\n  illustration and binding has been a matter of careful and artistic\r\n  consideration. Under this influence, a notable feature has been the\r\n  re-issue, in an excellent form, of illustrated editions of the works\r\n  of most of the famous writers.\r\n\r\n  In France the general movement has proceeded upon lines on the whole\r\n  very similar. Process--especially what was called \"Gillotage\"--was\r\n  adopted earlier, and used at first with greater liberality than in\r\n  England, although wood-engraving has persisted effectively even up to\r\n  our own time. In the various types of periodicals of which the _Revue\r\n  Illustrée_, _Figaro Illustré_ and _Gil Blas Illustré_ may be taken as\r\n  examples, the most noticeable feature is a use of colour-printing,\r\n  which is far in advance of anything generally attempted in Great\r\n  Britain. A favourite and effective process is that employed for the\r\n  reproduction of chalk drawings (as by Steinlen), which consists of the\r\n  application of a surface-tint of colour from a metal plate to a print\r\n  from an ordinary process block.\r\n\r\n  In Germany, _Jugend_, _Simplicissimus_, and other publications devoted\r\n  to humour and caricature, employ colour-printing to a great extent\r\n  with success. The organ of the artists of the younger German schools,\r\n  Pan (1895), makes use of every means of illustration, and has\r\n  especially cultivated lithography and wood-cuts, using these arts\r\n  effectively but with some eccentricity. Holland has also employed\r\n  coloured lithography for a remarkable series of children's books\r\n  illustrated by van Hoytema and others. The Viennese _Kunst und\r\n  Kunsthandwerk_ is an art publication which is exceptionally well\r\n  produced and printed.\r\n\r\n  Illustration in the United States has some few characteristics which\r\n  differentiate it from that of other countries. The later school of\r\n  fine wood-engraving is even yet in existence. American artists also\r\n  introduced an effective use of the process block, namely, the\r\n  engraving or working over of the whole or certain portions of it by\r\n  hand. This is generally done by an engraver, but in certain cases it\r\n  has been the work of the original draughtsman, and its possibilities\r\n  have been foreseen by him in making his drawing. The only other\r\n  variant of note is the use of half-tone blocks superimposed for\r\n  various colours.     (E. F. S.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nILLUSTRES, the Latin name given to the highest magistrates of the later\r\nRoman Empire. The designation was at first informal, and not strictly\r\ndifferentiated from other marks of honour. From the time of Valentinian\r\nI. it became an official title of the consuls, the chief praefecti or\r\nministers, and of the commanders-in-chief of the army. Its usage was\r\neventually extended to lower grades of the imperial service, and to\r\npensionaries from the order of the _spectabiles_. The Illustres were\r\nprivileged to be tried in criminal cases by none but the emperor or his\r\ndeputy, and to delegate procuratores to represent them in the courts.\r\n\r\n  See O. Hirschfeld in _Sitzungsberichte der Berliner Akademie_ (1901),\r\n  p. 594 sqq.; and T. Hodgkin, _Italy and her Invaders_ (Oxford, 1892),\r\n  i. 603-617.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nILLYRIA, a name applied to part of the Balkan Peninsula extending along\r\nthe eastern shore of the Adriatic from Fiume to Durazzo, and inland as\r\nfar as the Danube and the Servian Morava. This region comprises the\r\nmodern provinces or states of Dalmatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and\r\nMontenegro, with the southern half of Croatia-Slavonia, part of western\r\nServia, the sanjak of Novibazar, and the extreme north of Albania. As\r\nthe inhabitants of Illyria never attained complete political unity its\r\nlandward boundaries were never clearly defined. Indeed, the very name\r\nseems originally to have been an ethnological rather than a geographical\r\nterm; the older Greek historians usually wrote of \"the Illyrians\"\r\n([Greek: hoi Illyrioi]), while the names Illyris ([Greek: Illyris]) or\r\nless commonly Illyria ([Greek: Illyria]) came subsequently to be used of\r\nthe indeterminate area inhabited by the Illyrian tribes, i.e. a region\r\nextending eastward from the Adriatic between Liburnia on the N. and\r\nEpirus on the S., and gradually shading off into the territories of\r\nkindred peoples towards Thrace. The Latin name Illyricum was not, unless\r\nat a very early period, synonymous with Illyria; it also may originally\r\nhave signified the land inhabited by the Illyrians, but it became a\r\npolitical expression, and was applied to various divisions of the Roman\r\nEmpire, the boundaries of which were frequently changed and often\r\nincluded an area far larger than Illyria properly so called. Vienna and\r\nAthens at different times formed part of Illyricum, but no geographer\r\nwould ever have included these cities in Illyria.\r\n\r\n_Ethnology._--Little can be learned from written sources of the origin\r\nand character of the Illyrians. The Greek legend that Cadmus and\r\nHarmonia settled in Illyria and became the parents of Illyrius, the\r\neponymous ancestor of the whole Illyrian people, has been interpreted as\r\nan indication that the Greeks recognized some affinity between\r\nthemselves and the Illyrians; but this inference is based on\r\ninsufficient data. Herodotus and other Greek historians represent the\r\nIllyrians as a barbarous people, who resembled the ruder tribes of\r\nThrace. Both are described as tattooing their persons and offering human\r\nsacrifices to their gods. The women of Illyria seem to have occupied a\r\nhigh position socially and even to have exercised political power.\r\nQueens are mentioned among their rulers. Fuller and more trustworthy\r\ninformation can be obtained from archaeological evidence. In Bosnia the\r\nlake-dwellings at Butmir, the cemeteries of Jezerine and Glasinac and\r\nother sites have yielded numerous stone and horn implements, iron and\r\nbronze ornaments, weapons, &c., and objects of more recent date\r\nfashioned in silver, tin, amber and even glass. These illustrate various\r\nstages in the development of primitive Illyrian civilization, from the\r\nneolithic age onward. The Hallstatt and La Tène cultures are especially\r\nwell represented. (See W. Ridgeway, _The Early Age of Greece_, 1901; R.\r\nMunro, _Bosnia-Herzegovina and Dalmatia_, Edinburgh, 1900; and W.\r\nRadimský, _Die neolithische Station von Butmir_, Vienna, 1895-1898.)\r\nSimilar discoveries have been made in Dalmatia, as among the tumuli on\r\nthe Sabbioncello promontory, and in Croatia-Slavonia. H. Kiepert (\"Über\r\nden Volkstamm der Leleges,\" in _Monatsber. Berl. Akad._, 1861, p. 114)\r\nsought to prove that the Illyrians were akin to the Leleges; his theory\r\nwas supported by E. Schrader, but is not generally accepted. In Dalmatia\r\nthere appears to have been a large Celtic element, and Celtic\r\nplace-names are common. The ancient Illyrian languages fall into two\r\ngroups, the northern, closely connected with Venetic, and the southern,\r\nperhaps allied to Messapian and now probably represented by Albanian.\r\n\r\n  See K. Brugmann, _Kurze vergleichende Grammatik der Indogermanischen\r\n  Sprachen_ (Strassburg, 1904); and his larger _Grundriss der\r\n  vergleichenden Grammatik_ (2nd ed., Strassburg, 1897), with the\r\n  authorities there quoted, especially P. Kretschmer, _Einleitung in die\r\n  Geschichte der Griechischen Sprachen_ (Göttingen, 1896): see also\r\n  ALBANIA.\r\n\r\n_History._--Greek colonization on the Illyrian seaboard probably began\r\nlate in the 7th century B.C. or early in the 6th century. The most\r\nimportant settlements appear to have been at Epidamnus (Durazzo),\r\nTragurium (Traù), Rhizon (near Cattaro), Salona (near Spalato),\r\nEpidaurum (Ragusavecchia), Zara and on the islands of Curzola, Lesina\r\nand Lissa. There is a collection of Greek coins from Illyria in the\r\nmuseum at Agram, and the researches of Professor F. Bulié and others at\r\nSalona (see Spalato) have brought to light Greek inscriptions, Greek\r\npottery, &c. dating from 600 B.C. But Greek influence seems never to\r\nhave penetrated far into the interior, and even on the coast it was\r\nrapidly superseded by Latin civilization after the 3rd century B.C.\r\nUntil then the Illyrian tribes appear to have lived in a state of\r\nintermittent warfare with their neighbours and one another. They are\r\nsaid by Herodotus (ix. 43) to have attacked the temple of Delphi.\r\nBrasidas with his small army of Spartans was assaulted by them on his\r\nmarch (424 B.C.) across Thessaly and Macedonia to attack the Athenian\r\ncolonies in Thrace. The earlier history of the Macedonian kings is one\r\nconstant struggle against the Illyrian tribes. The migrations of the\r\nCelts at the beginning of the 4th century disturbed the country between\r\nthe Danube and the Adriatic. The Scordisci and other Celtic tribes\r\nsettled there, and forced the Illyrians towards the south. The\r\nnecessities of defence seem to have united the Illyrians under a chief\r\nBardylis (about 383 B.C.) and his son Clitus. Bardylis nearly succeeded\r\nin destroying the rising kingdom of Macedonia; King Amyntas II was\r\ndefeated, and a few years later Perdiccas was defeated and slain (359).\r\nBut the great Philip crushed the Illyrians completely, and annexed part\r\nof their country. During the next century we hear of them as pirates.\r\nIssuing from the secluded harbours of the coast, they ravaged the shores\r\nof Italy and Greece, and preyed on the commerce of the Adriatic. The\r\nGreeks applied to Rome for help. Teuta, the Illyrian queen, rejected the\r\nRoman demands for redress, and murdered the ambassadors; but the two\r\nIllyrian Wars (229 and 219 B.C.) ended in the submission of the\r\nIllyrians, a considerable part of their territory being annexed by the\r\nconquerors. Illyria, however, remained a powerful kingdom with its\r\ncapital at Scodra (Scutari in Albania), until 180 B.C., when the\r\nDalmatians declared themselves independent of Gentius or Genthius, the\r\nking of Illyria, and founded a republic with its capital at Delminium\r\n(see DALMATIA: _History_, on the site of Delminium). In 168 Gentius came\r\ninto conflict with the Romans, who conquered and annexed his country.\r\nDalmatia was invaded by a Roman army under Gaius Marcius Figulus in 156,\r\nbut Figulus was driven back to the Roman frontier, and in Dalmatia the\r\nIllyrians were not finally subdued until 165 years afterwards. Publius\r\nScipio Nasica, who succeeded Figulus, captured Delminium, and in 119 L.\r\nCaecilius Metellus overran the country and received a triumph and the\r\nsurname _Dalmaticus_. But in 51 a Dalmatian raid on Liburnia led to a\r\nrenewal of hostilities; the Roman armies were often worsted, and\r\nalthough in 39 Asinius Pollio gained some successes (see Horace, _Odes_\r\nii. 1. 15) these appear to have been exaggerated, and it was not until\r\nOctavian took the field in person that the Dalmatians submitted in 33.\r\n(For an account of the war see Appian, _Illyrica_, 24-28; Dio Cassius\r\nxlix. 38; Livy, _Epit._ 131, 132). They again revolted in 16 and 11, and\r\nin A.D. 6-9 joined the rebel Pannonians. Suetonius (_Tiberius_, 16)\r\ndeclares that they were the most formidable enemies with whom the Romans\r\nhad had to contend since the Punic Wars. In A.D. 9, however, Tiberius\r\nentirely subjugated them, for which he was awarded a triumph in 12 (Dio\r\nCass. lv. 23-29, lvi. 11-17; Vell. Pat. ii. 110-115). Thenceforward\r\nDalmatia, Iapydia and Liburnia were united as the province of Illyricum.\r\n\r\nLatin civilization spread rapidly, the cultivation of the vine was\r\nintroduced, gold-mining was carried on in Bosnia, and flourishing\r\ncommercial cities arose along the coast. Illyria became one of the best\r\nrecruiting grounds for the Roman legions; and in troubled times many\r\nIllyrian soldiers fought their way up from the ranks to the imperial\r\npurple. Claudius, Aurelian, Probus, Diocletian and Maximian were all\r\nsons of Illyrian peasants. It is probable, however, that most of the\r\nhighland tribes now represented by the Albanians remained almost\r\nunaffected by Roman influence. The importance of Illyricum caused its\r\nname to be extended to many neighbouring districts; in the 2nd century\r\nA.D. the _Illyricus Limes_ included Noricum, Pannonia, Moesia, Dacia and\r\nThrace. In the reorganization of the empire by Diocletian (285) the\r\ndiocese of Illyricum was created; it comprised Pannonia, Noricum and\r\nDalmatia, while Dacia and Macedonia, together called Eastern Illyricum,\r\nwere added later. Either Diocletian or after him Constantine made\r\nIllyricum one of the four prefectures, each governed by a _praefectus\r\npraetorio_, into which the empire was divided. This prefecture included\r\nPannonia, Noricum, Crete and the entire Balkan peninsula except Thrace,\r\nwhich was attached by Constantine to the prefecture of the East. From\r\nthe partition of the empire in 285 until 379 Illyricum was included in\r\nthe Western Empire, but thenceforward Eastern Illyricum was annexed to\r\nthe Eastern Empire; its frontier was almost identical with the line of\r\ndemarcation between Latin-speaking and Greek-speaking peoples, and\r\nroughly corresponded to the boundary which now severs Latin from Greek\r\nChristianity in the Balkan peninsula. The whole peninsula except Thrace\r\nwas still known as Illyricum, but was subdivided into Illyris Barbara or\r\nRomana and Illyris Graeca (Eastern Illyricum with Greece and Crete). The\r\nVia Egnatia, the great line of road which connected Rome with\r\nConstantinople and the East, led across Illyricum from Dyrrachium to\r\nThessalonica.\r\n\r\nIn the 5th century began a series of invasions which profoundly modified\r\nthe ethnical character and the civilization of the Illyrians. In 441 and\r\n447 their country was ravaged by the Huns. In 481 Dalmatia was added to\r\nthe Ostrogothic kingdom, which already included the more northerly parts\r\nof Illyricum, i.e. Pannonia and Noricum. Dalmatia was partially\r\nreconquered by Justinian in 536, but after 565 it was devastated by the\r\nAvars, and throughout the century bands of Slavonic invaders had been\r\ngradually establishing themselves in Illyria, where, unlike the earlier\r\nbarbarian conquerors, they formed permanent settlements. Between 600 and\r\n650 the main body of the immigrants occupied Illyria (see SERVIA:\r\n_History_; and SLAVS). It consisted of Croats and Serbs, two groups of\r\ntribes who spoke a single language and were so closely related that the\r\norigin of the distinction between them is obscure. The Croats settled in\r\nthe western half of Illyria, the Serbs in the eastern; thus the former\r\ncame gradually under the influence of Italy and Roman Catholicism, the\r\nlatter under the influence of Byzantium and the Greek Church. Hence the\r\ndistinction between them became a marked difference of civilization and\r\ncreed, which has always tended to keep the Illyrian Slavs politically\r\ndisunited.\r\n\r\nThe Croats and Serbs rapidly absorbed most of the Latinized Illyrians.\r\nBut the wealthy and powerful city-states on the coast were strong enough\r\nto maintain their independence and their distinctively Italian\r\ncharacter. Other Roman provincials took refuge in the mountains of the\r\ninterior; these Mavrovlachi, as they were called (see DALMATIA:\r\n_Population_; and VLACHS), preserved their language and nationality for\r\nmany centuries. The Illyrian tribes which had withstood the attraction\r\nof Roman civilization remained unconquered among the mountains of\r\nAlbania and were never Slavonized. With these exceptions Illyria became\r\nentirely Serbo-Croatian in population, language and culture.\r\n\r\nThe name of Illyria had by this time disappeared from history. In\r\nliterature it was preserved, and the scene of Shakespeare's comedy,\r\n_Twelfth Night_, is laid in Illyria. Politically the name was revived in\r\n1809, when the name Illyrian Provinces was given to Carniola, Dalmatia,\r\nIstria, Fiume, Görz and Gradisca, and Trieste, with parts of Carinthia\r\nand Croatia; these territories were ceded by Austria to Italy at the\r\npeace of Schönnbrun (14th Oct. 1809). The Illyrian Provinces were\r\noccupied by French troops and governed in the interest of Napoleon; the\r\nrepublic of Ragusa was annexed to them in 1811, but about the end of\r\n1813 the French occupation ceased to be effective and the provinces\r\nreverted to Austria. The kingdom of Illyria, which was constituted in\r\n1816 out of the crown-lands of Carinthia, Carniola, Istria, Görz and\r\nGradisca, and Trieste, formed until 1849 a kingdom of the Austrian\r\ncrown.

Pop. (1905) 11,222. The town, which\r\nstands picturesquely among wooded hills, is much frequented by visitors\r\nin the summer. It was a favourite resort of Goethe, who wrote here his\r\n_Iphigenie_, and often stayed at Gabelbach in the neighbourhood. It has\r\na grand-ducal palace, a Roman Catholic and two Evangelical churches, a\r\nsanatorium for nervous disorders, and several educational\r\nestablishments. Its chief manufactures are glass and porcelain, toys,\r\ngloves and chemicals, and the town has tanneries and saw-mills. Formerly\r\na part of the county of Henneberg, Ilmenau came in 1631 into the\r\npossession of electoral Saxony, afterwards passing to Saxe-Weimar.\r\n\r\n  See R. Springer, _Die klassischen Stätten von Jena und Ilmenau_\r\n  (Berlin, 1869); Pasig, _Goethe und Ilmenau_ (2nd ed., Weimar, 1902);\r\n  and Fils, _Bad Ilmenau und seine Umgebung_ (Hildburghausen, 1886).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nILMENITE, a mineral known also as titanic iron, formerly regarded as an\r\niron and titanium sesquioxide (Fe, Ti)2O3 isomorphous with haematite\r\n(Fe2O3), but now generally considered to be an iron titanate FeTiO3\r\nisomorphous with pyrophanite (MnTiO3) and geikielite (MgTiO3). It\r\ncrystallizes in the parallel-faced hemihedral class of the rhombohedral\r\nsystem, thus having the same degree of symmetry as phenacite and\r\npyrophanite, but differing from that of haematite. The angles between\r\nthe faces are very nearly the same as between the corresponding faces of\r\nhaematite; but it is to be noted that the rhombohedral angle (94° 29´)\r\nof ilmenite is not intermediate between that of haematite (94° 0´) and\r\nof the artificially prepared crystals of titanium sesquioxide (92° 40´),\r\nwhich should be the case if the three substances were isomorphous.\r\nAnalyses show wide variations in chemical composition, and there is a\r\ngradation from normal ilmenite FeTiO3 (with titanium dioxide 52.7, and\r\nferrous oxide 47.3%) to titaniferous haematite and titaniferous\r\nmagnetite. Frequently also, magnesia and manganous oxide are present in\r\nsmall amounts, the former reaching 16%. The formula (Fe, Mg)TiO3 is then\r\nanalogous to those of geikielite and pyrophanite. Many analyses show the\r\npresence of TiO2 and (Fe, Mg)O in this ratio of 1:1, yet there is often\r\nan excess of ferric oxide to be accounted for; this may perhaps be\r\nexplained by the regular intergrowth on a minute scale of ilmenite with\r\nhaematite, like the intergrowth of such substances as calcite and sodium\r\nnitrate, which are similar crystallographically but not chemically.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn many of its external characters ilmenite is very similar to\r\nhaematite; the crystals often have the same tabular or lamellar habit;\r\nthe twin-laws are the same, giving rise to twin-lamellae and planes of\r\nparting parallel to the basal plane and the primitive rhombohedron; the\r\ncolour is iron-black with a submetallic lustre; finally, the conchoidal\r\nfracture is the same in both minerals. Ilmenite has a black streak; it\r\nis opaque, but in very thin scales sometimes transparent with a\r\nclove-brown colour. It is slightly magnetic, but without polarity. The\r\nhardness is 5½, and the specific gravity varies with the chemical\r\ncomposition from 4.3 to 5.0.\r\n\r\nOwing to the wide variations in composition, which even yet are not\r\nproperly understood, several varieties of the mineral have been\r\ndistinguished by special names. Crichtonite occurs as small and\r\nbrilliant crystals of acute rhombohedral habit on quartz at Le Bourg\r\nd'Oisans in Dauphiné; it agrees closely in composition with the formula\r\nFeTiO3 and has a specific gravity of 4.7. Manaccanite (or Menaccanite)\r\nis a black sandy material, first found in 1791 in a stream at Manaccan\r\nnear Helston in Cornwall. Iserite, from Iserwiese in the Iser Mountains,\r\nBohemia, is a similar sand, but containing some octahedral crystals,\r\npossibly of titaniferous magnetite. Washingtonite is found as large\r\ntabular crystals at Washington, Connecticut. Uddevallite is from\r\nUddevalla in Sweden. Picrotitanite or picroilmenite (Gr. [Greek: pikros],\r\n\"bitter\") is the name given to varieties containing a considerable\r\namount of magnesia. Other varieties are kibdelophane, hystatite, &c. The\r\nname ilmenite, proposed by A. T. Kupffer in 1827, is after the Ilmen\r\nMountains in the southern Urals, whence come the best crystals of the\r\nmineral. The largest crystals, sometimes as much as 16 lb. in weight,\r\nare from Kragerö and Arendal in Norway.\r\n\r\nIlmenite occurs, often in association with magnetite, in gneisses and\r\nschists, sometimes forming beds of considerable extent, but of little or\r\nno economic value. It is a common accessory constituent of igneous rocks\r\nof all kinds, more especially basic rocks such as gabbro, diabase and\r\nbasalt. In these rocks it occurs as platy crystals, and is frequently\r\nrepresented by a white, opaque alteration product known as leucoxene.\r\n     (L. J. S.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nILOILO, a town, port of entry and the capital of the province of Iloilo,\r\nPanay, Philippine Islands, at the mouth of Iloilo river, on the S.E.\r\ncoast. Pop. (1903) 19,054. In 1903, after the census had been taken, the\r\npopulation of the town was more than doubled by the addition of the\r\nmunicipalities of La Paz (pop. 5724), Mandurriao (pop. 4482), Molo (pop.\r\n8551) and Jaro (pop. 10,681); in 1908 Jaro again became a separate town.\r\nThe town is built on low sandy ground, is irregularly laid out, and its\r\nstreets are not paved. It has a good government house and a fine church.\r\nThe harbour, suitable for ships of 15 ft. draught, is well protected by\r\nthe island of Guimaras, and ocean-going vessels can lie in the channel.\r\nThe surrounding country, which is traversed by gravel roads leading to\r\nthe principal towns of the province, is fertile and well cultivated,\r\nproducing sugar, tobacco and rice in abundance. In commercial importance\r\nIloilo ranks next to Manila among Philippine cities; it has manufactures\r\nof piña, jusi, coconut oil, lime, vinegar and various articles made from\r\npalm wood. Much of the town was burned by Filipino insurgents soon after\r\nits capture by American troops in February 1899.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nILSENBURG, a village and health resort of Germany, in Prussian Saxony,\r\nromantically situated under the north foot of the Harz Mountains, at the\r\nentrance to the Ilsethal, 6 m. N.W. from Wernigerode by the railway to\r\nGoslar. Pop. (1900) 3868. It has an Evangelical church, a modern château\r\nof the princes of Stolberg, with pretty grounds, and a high grade\r\nschool, and manufactures metal wares, machines and iron screws and\r\nbolts.\r\n\r\nOwing to its charming surroundings and its central position in the\r\nrange, Ilsenburg is one of the most frequented tourist resorts in the\r\nHarz Mountains, being visited annually by some 6000 persons. The old\r\ncastle, Schloss Ilsenburg, lying on a high crag above the town, was\r\noriginally an imperial stronghold and was probably built by the German\r\nking Henry I. The emperor Otto III. resided here in 995, Henry II.\r\nbestowed it in 1003 upon the bishop of Halberstadt, who converted it\r\ninto a Benedictine monastery, and the school attached to it enjoyed a\r\ngreat reputation towards the end of the 11th century. After the\r\nReformation the castle passed to the counts of Wernigerode, who restored\r\nit and made it their residence until 1710. Higher still, on the edge of\r\nthe plateau rises the Ilsenstein, a granite peak standing about 500 ft.\r\nabove the valley, crowned by an iron cross erected by Count Anton von\r\nStolberg-Wernigerode in memory of his friends who fell in the wars of\r\n1813-1815. Around this rock cluster numerous legends.\r\n\r\n  See Jacobs, _Urkundenbuch des Klosters Ilsenburg_ (Halle, 1875);\r\n  Brandes, _Ilsenburg als Sommeraufenthalt_ (Wernigerode, 1885); and H.\r\n  Herre, _Ilsenburger Annalen_ (Leipzig, 1890).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMAGE (Lat. _imago_, perhaps from the same root as _imitari_, copy,\r\nimitate), in general, a copy, representation, exact counterpart of\r\nsomething else. Thus the reflection of a person in a mirror is known as\r\nhis \"image\"; in popular usage one person is similarly described as \"the\r\nvery image\" of another; so in entomology the term is applied in its\r\nLatin form _imago_ to an insect which, having passed through its larval\r\nstages, has achieved its full typical development. The term is in fact\r\nsusceptible of two opposite connotations; on the one hand, it implies\r\nthat the thing to which it is applied is only a copy; on the other that\r\nas a copy it is faithful and accurate.\r\n\r\nPsychology (q.v.) recognizes two uses of the term. The simplest is for\r\nthe impression made by an observed object on the retina, the eye; in\r\nthis connexion the term \"after-image\" (better \"after-sensation\") is used\r\nfor an image which remains when the eye is withdrawn from a brilliantly\r\nlighted object; it is called positive when the colour remains the same,\r\nnegative when the complementary colours are seen. The strict\r\npsychological use of the term \"image\" is by analogy from the\r\nphysiological for a purely mental idea which is taken as being observed\r\nby the eye of the mind. These images are created or produced not by an\r\nexternal stimulus, such as is necessary for a visual image (even the\r\nafter-image is due to the continued excitement of the same organ), but\r\nby a mental act of reproduction. The simplest ideational image, which\r\nhas been described as the primary memory-image, is \"the peculiarly vivid\r\nand definite ideal representation of an object which we can maintain or\r\nrecall by a suitable effort of attention immediately after perceiving\r\nit\" (Stout). For this no external stimulus is required, and as compared\r\nwith the after-image it represents the objects in perspective just as\r\nthey might be seen in perception. This is characteristic of all mental\r\nimages. The essential requisite for this primary image is that the\r\nattention should have been fixed upon the impressions.\r\n\r\nThe relation between sense-impressions and mental images is a highly\r\ncomplicated one. Difference in intensity is not a wholly satisfactory\r\nground of distinction; abnormal physical conditions apart, an image may\r\nhave an intensity far greater than that of a sense-given impression. On\r\nthe other hand, Hume is certainly right in holding that the distinctive\r\ncharacter of a percept as compared with an image is in all ordinary\r\ncases the force and liveliness with which it strikes the mind--the\r\ndistinction, therefore, being one of quality, not of degree. A\r\ndistinction of some importance is found in the \"superior steadiness\"\r\n(Ward) of impressions; while looking at any set of surroundings, images\r\nof many different scenes may pass through the mind, each one of which is\r\nimmediately distinguished from the impression of the actual scene before\r\nthe eyes. This arises partly, no doubt, from the fact that the\r\nperception has clear localization, which the image has not. In many\r\ncases indeed an image even of a most familiar scene is exceedingly vague\r\nand inaccurate.\r\n\r\nIn Art the term is used for a representation or likeness of an animate\r\nor inanimate object, particularly of the figure of a person in sculpture\r\nor painting. The most general application of the word is to such a\r\nrepresentation when used as an object of religious worship or adoration,\r\nor as a decorative or architectural ornament in places of religious\r\nworship. The worship of images, or idolatry, from the point of view of\r\ncomparative religion, is treated in the article IMAGE-WORSHIP, and the\r\nhistory of the attitude of the Christian church, outside the\r\npost-Reformation church of England, towards the use of images as objects\r\nof worship and religion in the article ICONOCLASTS. With regard to the\r\nPre-Reformation period in England, it is of interest to note that by the\r\nconstitutions of Archbishop Winchelsey, 1305, it was the duty of the\r\nparish to provide for the parish church, among other objects, the images\r\nof Christ on the Cross, of the saint to whom the church was dedicated,\r\nto be placed in the chancel, and of other saints. The injunctions of\r\nEdward VI., 1547, ordered the destruction of all images that had been\r\nthe objects of superstitious use, and the act of 1549 (3 & 4 Edw. VI. c.\r\n10) declared all such images illegal. This act, repealed in Mary's\r\nreign, was revived in 1604 (1 James I. c. 25) and is still in force. The\r\npresent effect of this unrepealed act, as stated in _Boyd_ v.\r\n_Philpotts_ (L.R. 6 P.C. 449), is that it only referred to the images\r\nthen subject to abuse, which had been ordered to be removed, and did not\r\nrefer to the subsequent use or abuse of other images. In Article XXII.\r\nof the Articles of Religion it is laid down that \"the Romish Doctrine\r\nconcerning ... Worshipping and Adoration as well of Images as of\r\nReliques ... is a fond thing mainly invented and grounded on no warranty\r\nof Scripture, but rather repugnant to the Word of God.\" The law in\r\nregard to images, which in this connexion include pictures and\r\nstained-glass windows, but not sculptured effigies on monuments or\r\nmerely ornamental work, is contained in various judicial decisions, and\r\nis not defined by statute. The effect of these decisions is thus\r\nsummarized in the report of the Royal Commission on Ecclesiastical\r\nDiscipline, 1906: \"Such images are lawful as objects of decoration in a\r\nchurch, but are unlawful if they are made, or are in danger of being\r\nmade, objects of superstitious reverence, contrary to Article XXII.\r\nagainst the worshipping and adoration of images. In accordance with this\r\nview, crosses, if not placed on the Holy Table, and also crucifixes, if\r\npart only of a sculptured design or architectural decoration, have been\r\ndeclared lawful. The question whether a crucifix or rood standing alone\r\nor combined with figures of the Blessed Virgin and St John can, in any\r\ncircumstances, be regarded as merely decorative, has given rise to a\r\ndifference of judicial opinion and appears to be unsettled.\" Speaking\r\ngenerally, articles of decoration and embellishment not used in the\r\nservices cannot lawfully be introduced into a church without the consent\r\nof the ordinary given by a faculty, the granting of which is subject to\r\nthe judicial discretion of the chancellor or commissary, sitting as\r\njudge of the bishop's court. By section 8 of the Public Worship\r\nRegulation Act 1874, complainants may take proceedings if it is\r\nconsidered that \"any alteration in, or addition to, the fabric,\r\nornaments or furniture has been made without legal authority, or that\r\nany decoration forbidden by law has been introduced into such church ...\r\nprovided that no proceedings shall be taken ... if such alteration or\r\naddition has been completed five years before the commencement of such\r\nproceedings.\" The following are the principal cases on the subject: in\r\n_Boyd_ v. _Philpotts_, 1874 (L.R., 4 _Ad. & Ec._ 297; 6 P.C. 435), the\r\nExeter reredos case, the privy council, reversing the bishop's judgment,\r\nallowed the structure, which contained sculptures in high relief of the\r\nAscension, Transfiguration and Descent of the Holy Ghost at Pentecost,\r\ntogether with a cross and angels; in _R._ v. _the Bishop of London_,\r\n1889 (23 _Q.B.D._ 414, 24 _Q.B.D._ 213), the St Paul's reredos case, the\r\nbishop refused further proceedings against the legality of a structure\r\ncontaining sculptured figures of Christ on the Cross and the Virgin and\r\nChild. In _Clifton_ v. _Ridsdale_, 1876 (1 P. & D., 316), a metal\r\ncrucifix on the centre of the chancel screen was declared illegal as\r\nbeing in danger of being used superstitiously, and in the same case\r\npictures or rather coloured reliefs representing the \"Stations of the\r\nCross\" were ordered to be removed on the ground that they had been\r\nerected without a faculty, and were also considered unlawful by Lord\r\nPenzance as connected with certain superstitious devotion authorized by\r\nthe Roman church.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMAGE WORSHIP. It is obvious that two religious votaries kneeling\r\ntogether before a statue may entertain widely different conceptions of\r\nwhat the image is and signifies, although their outward attitude is the\r\nsame. The one may regard it as a mere image, picture or representation\r\nof the higher being, void in itself of value or power. It is to him,\r\nlike the photograph hung on a wall of one we love, cherished as a\r\npicture and no more. But the other may regard it, as a little girl\r\nregards her doll, as an animated being, no mere picture, but as tenement\r\nand vehicle of the god and fraught with divine influence. The former is\r\nthe attitude which the Latin Church officially inculcates towards sacred\r\npictures and statues; they are intended to convey to the eyes of the\r\nfaithful, especially to the illiterate among them, the history of Jesus,\r\nof the Virgin and of the saints. The other attitude, however, is that\r\ninto which simple-minded Latin peasants actually lapse, as it is also\r\nthat which characterizes other religions ancient or modern which use\r\npictures or sculptures of gods, demons, men, brutes, or of particular\r\nparts and organs of the same. With the latter attitude alone does the\r\npresent article deal, and it may conveniently be called idolatry or\r\nimage worship. For the history of the use of images in Christian worship\r\nsee ICONOCLASTS.\r\n\r\nThe image or idol differs from the fetish, charm, talisman, phylactery\r\nor miraculous relic, only in this, that either in the flat or the round\r\nit _resembles_ the power adored; it has a prototype capable of being\r\nbrought before the eye and visualized. This is not necessarily the case\r\nwith the worshipper of _aniconic_ or unshaped gods. The Semite or savage\r\nwho sets up a sacred stone or Bethel believes indeed that a divine power\r\nor influence enters the stone and dwells in it, and he treats the stone\r\nas if it were the god, kisses it, anoints it with oil, feeds the god in\r\nit by pouring out over it the blood of victims slain. But he is not an\r\nidolater, for he has not \"made unto himself any graven image, nor the\r\nlikeness of anything that is in heaven above or in the water beneath or\r\nin the water under the earth.\"\r\n\r\nThe question arises: must the stage of aniconic gods historically\r\nprecede and lead up to that of pictures and images? Are the latter a\r\ndevelopment of the former? In the history of human religions can we\r\ntrace, as it were, a law of transition from sacred stock and stone up to\r\npicture and image? Is it true to say that the latter is characteristic\r\nof a later and higher stage of religious development? It was perhaps the\r\nfacility with which a pillar of stone or wood can be turned into an\r\nimage by painting or sculpturing on it eyes, ears, mouth, marks of sex\r\nand so on, which led anthropologists of an earlier generation to\r\npostulate such a law of development; but facts do not bear it out. In\r\nthe first place, what we are accustomed to call higher religions\r\ndeliberately attach greater sanctity to aniconic gods than to iconic\r\nones, and that from no artistic incapacity. The Jews were as well able\r\nas their neighbours to fashion golden calves, snakes and the minor idols\r\ncalled teraphim, when their legislator, in the words we have just cited,\r\nforbade the ancillary use of all plastic and pictorial art for religious\r\npurposes. And of our own Christianity, Robertson Smith remarks as\r\nfollows: \"The host in the Mass is artistically as much inferior to the\r\nVenus of Milo as a Semitic _Masseba_ was, but no one will say that\r\nmedieval Christianity is a lower form of religion than Aphrodite\r\nworship.\"\r\n\r\nHere then in the most marked manner the aniconic sacrament has ousted\r\npictures and statues. It is the embodiment and home of divine\r\npersonality and power, and not they. Equally contradictory of any such\r\nlaw of development is the circumstance that the Greeks of the 5th and\r\n4th centuries B.C., although Pheidias and other artists were embodying\r\ntheir gods and goddesses in the most perfect of images, nevertheless\r\ncontinued to cherish the rude aniconic stocks and stones of their\r\nancestors. If any such law ever operated in human religious development,\r\nhow can we explain the following facts. In the shadowy age which\r\npreceded the Stone age and hardly ended later than 10,000 B.C., the\r\ncave-dwellers of the Dordogne could draw elks, bisons, elephants and\r\nother animals at rest or in movement, with a freshness and realism which\r\nto-day only a Landseer can rival. And yet in the European Stone age\r\nwhich followed, the age in which the great menhirs and cromlechs were\r\nerected, in which the domestication of animals began and the first corn\r\nwas sown, we find in the strata no image of man or beast, big or little.\r\n\r\nWhence this seeming blight and decay of art? Salomon Reinach, guided by\r\nthe analogy of similar practices among the aborigines of Australia, and\r\nnoticing that these primitive pictures represent none but animals that\r\nformed the staple food of the age and place, and that they are usually\r\nfound in the deepest and darkest recesses of the caves where they could\r\nonly be drawn and seen by torchlight, has argued that they were not\r\nintended for artistic gratification (a late motive in human art), but\r\nwere magical representations destined to influence and perhaps attract\r\nthe hunter's quarry. In a word this earliest art was ancillary to the\r\nchase. It is a common practice in the magic of all ages and countries to\r\nacquire control and influence over men and animals by making images of\r\nthem. The prototype is believed to suffer whatever is done to the image.\r\nReinach, therefore, supposes that in the Stone age which succeeded,\r\npictorial art was banned because it had got into the hands of magicians\r\nand had come to be regarded as inevitably uncanny and malefic. This is\r\ncertainly the secret of the ordinary Mahommedan prohibition of pictures\r\nand statues, which goes even to the length of denying to poor little\r\nArab girls the enjoyment of having dolls. It is felt that if you have\r\ngot a picture of any one, you have some power of harming him through it;\r\nyou can bind or loose him, just as you can a Djinn whose name you have\r\nsomehow learned. It is as dangerous for your enemy to have a picture of\r\nyou as for him to know your name. The old Hebrew prohibition of graven\r\nimages was surely based on a like superstition, so far as it was not\r\nmerely due to the physical impossibility for nomads of heavy statues\r\nthat do not admit of being carried from camp to camp and from pasture to\r\npasture. Possessing no images of Yahweh the Jews were also not exposed\r\nto the same risk as were idolaters of having their gods stolen by their\r\nfoes and used against them. Lastly, the restriction to aniconic worship\r\nsaved them from much superstition, for there is nothing which so much\r\nstimulates the growth of a mythology as the manufacture of idols. The\r\nartist must indeed start with imaginative types, revealed to him in\r\nvisions or borrowed from current myths. But the tendency of his art is\r\nto give rise to new tales of the gods. There is perpetual action and\r\nreaction between picture and myth; and a legislator desiring to purify\r\nand raise his countrymen's religion must devote no less attention to\r\ntheir plastic art than to their hymnology.\r\n\r\nMotives drawn from homoeopathic magic may thus explain the occasional\r\ndisuse and prohibition of pictorial and plastic art in cult; they may\r\nequally explain its genesis and rise in certain ages and countries.\r\nPrayer is much more hopeful and efficacious for a worshipper who has\r\nmeans of bringing near to himself, and even coercing the god he\r\nworships. An image fashioned like a god, and which has this advantage\r\nover a mere stock and stone that it declares itself and reveals at a\r\nglance to what god it is sacred, must surely attract and influence the\r\ngod to choose it as his home and tenement. And having the god thus at\r\nhand and imprisoned in matter, the simple-minded worshipper can punish\r\nhim if his prayers are left unanswered. Dr E. B. Tylor accordingly (in\r\nhis chapter on \"Idolatry\" in _Primitive Culture_, ii. 170), reminds us\r\nof \"the negro who feeds ancestral images and brings them a share of his\r\ntrade profits, but will beat an idol or fling it into the fire if it\r\ncannot give him luck or preserve him from sickness.\" So Augustus Caesar,\r\nhaving lost some ships in a storm, punished Neptune by forbidding his\r\nimage to be carried in procession at the Circensian games (Sueton.\r\n_Aug._ 16).\r\n\r\nIn certain cases the wish to carry elsewhere the cult of a favourite or\r\nancestral cult, may have dictated the manufacture of images that declare\r\nthemselves and reveal at a glance whose they are. Thus a Phoenician\r\ncolonist might desire to carry abroad the cult of a certain Baal or\r\nAstarte who lived in a conical stone or pillar. Pilgrims visiting\r\nPaphos, the original home and temple of Astarte, could of course be in\r\nno doubt about which of the heavenly powers inhabited the cone of stone\r\nin which she was there held to be immanent; nor was any Semite ever\r\nignorant as to which Baal he stood before. It was necessarily the Baal\r\nor Lord of the region. But small portrait statues must surely have been\r\nmade to be carried about or used in private worship. Meanwhile the\r\nshapeless cone remained the object of public adoration and pilgrimage.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptian writer Hermes Trismegistus (c. 250), in a work called\r\n_Asclepius_ (cited by Augustine, _De civit. Dei_, viii. 26), claims that\r\nhis ancestors discovered the art of making gods, and since they could\r\nnot create souls, they called up the souls of demons or angels and\r\nintroduced them into the holy images and divine mysteries, that through\r\nthese souls the idols might possess powers of doing good and harm. This\r\nwas the belief of the pagans, and the Christians for centuries shared it\r\nwith them. Not a few Christian martyrs sought and won the palm by\r\nsmashing the idols in order to dislodge the indwelling devil;\r\noccasionally their zeal was further gratified by beholding it pass away\r\nlike smoke from its ruined home.\r\n\r\nImage worship then is a sort of animism. It is a continuance by adults\r\nof their childish games with dolls. In the Roman religion, on a feast of\r\nthanksgiving for a great victory, couches were spread in the temples for\r\nthe gods, whose images were taken down from their pedestals and laid on\r\nthe couches, and tables set before them loaded with delicate viands.\r\nThis was called a _Lectisternium_. So Marco Polo (i. chap. 53) relates\r\nhow the Tatars had each a figure of Natigay, the god of the earth, who\r\nwatched over their children, cattle and crops. The image was made of\r\nfelt and cloth, and similar images of his wife and children were set on\r\nhis left hand and in front of him. \"And when they eat, they take the fat\r\nof the meat and grease the god's mouth withal, as well as the mouths of\r\nhis wife and children.\" The old Greek statues moved of themselves, shook\r\ntheir spears, kneeled down, spoke, walked, wept, laughed, winked, and\r\neven bled and sweated,--a mighty portent. Images of Christ, of the\r\nVirgin and saints have achieved many a similar miraculous portent. A\r\nfigure of Christ has been known even to give its shoes to a poor man,\r\nand a Virgin to drop a ring off her finger to a suppliant. In Umbrian\r\nvillages on Easter Sunday the images of Jesus and His Mother are carried\r\nin rival processions from their respective chapels, and are made to bow\r\nwhen they meet face to face. The spectators applaud or hiss according as\r\nthey make their bow well or ill. In antiquity it was a common ceremony\r\nto arrange a holy marriage between male and female images, and such\r\nunions acted on the earth as a fertility charm. Much of a priest's time\r\nwas given up to the toilet of the god or goddess. Thus Isis was dressed\r\nand coiffed every day by her special attendants according to Apuleius\r\n(_Met._ xi. 9). Like the statue of St Agatha of Catania to-day, her\r\nimage was loaded with jewels, and an inscription of Cadiz (_C.I.L._ ii.\r\n3386) contains an inventory of the jewels with which Isis had been\r\nendowed by Spanish devotees.\r\n\r\nIdolatrous cults repose so largely on make-believe and credulity that\r\nthe priests who administered them, perhaps oftener than we know, fell\r\ninto the kind of imposture and trickery of which the legend of Bel and\r\nthe dragon represents a classical example. \"Thinkest thou not,\" said\r\nKing Astyages, \"that Bel is a living god? Or seest thou not how much he\r\neateth and drinketh every day? Then Daniel laughed, and said, O King, be\r\nnot deceived: for this is but clay within, and brass without, and did\r\nnever eat or drink anything.\" In the sequel Daniel proves to the king\r\nthat the priests with their wives and children came in through privy\r\ndoors and consumed the viands set before the god; and the king, angered\r\nat their trickery, slew them all and gave Bel over to Daniel for\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nThe invectives against idolatry of the early Jewish and Christian\r\napologists, of Philo, Minucius Felix, Tertullian, Arnobius, Lactantius\r\nand others, are very good reading and throw much light on the question\r\nhow an ancient pagan conceived of his idols. One capital argument of the\r\nChristians was the absurdity of a man making an idol and then being\r\nafraid of or adoring the work of his own hands. Lactantius preserves the\r\nanswer of the pagans so attacked (_De origine Erroris_, ii. 2): We do\r\nnot, they said, fear the images themselves, but those beings after whose\r\nlikeness they were fashioned and by whose names they were consecrated.\r\nFew such rites of consecration remain, but they must have been similar\r\nto those used in India to-day. There the Brahmin invites the god to\r\ndwell within the image, specially made hollow to contain him,\r\n\"performing the ceremony of _adhivasa_ or inhabitation, after which he\r\nputs in the eyes and the _prana_, i.e. breath, life or soul.\"[1]\r\nSimilarly Augustine (_De civ. Dei_, viii. 23) relates how, according to\r\nHermes, the spirits entered by invitation (_spiritus invitatos_), so\r\nthat the images became bodies of the gods (_corpora deorum_). Thus the\r\ninvisible spirits by a certain art are so joined unto the visible\r\nobjects of corporeal matter that the latter become as it were animated\r\nbodies, images dedicated to those spirits and controlled by them (see\r\nCONSECRATION). Such statues were animated with sense and full of spirit,\r\nthey foresaw the future, and foretold it by lot, through their priests,\r\nin dreams and in other ways.\r\n\r\n  See E. B.

Culture_, ii. 178.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMAGINATION, in general, the power or process of producing mental\r\npictures or ideas. The term is technically used in psychology for the\r\nprocess of reviving in the mind percepts of objects formerly given in\r\nsense perception. Since this use of the term conflicts with that of\r\nordinary language, some psychologists have preferred to describe this\r\nprocess as \"imaging\" or \"imagery\" or to speak of it as \"reproductive\" as\r\nopposed to \"productive\" or \"constructive\" imagination (see IMAGE and\r\nPSYCHOLOGY). The common use of the term is for the process of forming in\r\nthe mind new images which have not been previously experienced, or at\r\nleast only partially or in different combinations. Thus the image of a\r\ncentaur is the result of combining the common percepts of man and horse:\r\nfairy tales and fiction generally are the result of this process of\r\ncombination. Imagination in this sense, not being limited to the\r\nacquisition of exact knowledge by the requirements of practical\r\nnecessity, is up to a certain point free from objective restraints. In\r\nvarious spheres, however, even imagination is in practice limited: thus\r\na man whose imaginations do violence to the elementary laws of thought,\r\nor to the necessary principles of practical possibility, or to the\r\nreasonable probabilities of a given case is regarded as insane. The same\r\nlimitations beset imagination in the field of scientific hypothesis.\r\nProgress in scientific research is due largely to provisional\r\nexplanations which are constructed by imagination, but such hypotheses\r\nmust be framed in relation to previously ascertained facts and in\r\naccordance with the principles of the particular science. In spite,\r\nhowever, of these broad practical considerations, imagination differs\r\nfundamentally from belief in that the latter involves \"objective control\r\nof subjective activity\" (Stout). The play of imagination, apart from the\r\nobvious limitations (e.g. of avoiding explicit self-contradiction), is\r\nconditioned only by the general trend of the mind at a given moment.\r\nBelief, on the other hand, is immediately related to practical activity:\r\nit is perfectly possible to _imagine_ myself a millionaire, but unless I\r\n_believe_ it I do not, therefore, act as such. Belief always endeavours\r\nto conform to objective conditions; though it is from one point of view\r\nsubjective it is also objectively conditioned, whereas imagination as\r\nsuch is specifically free. The dividing line between imagination and\r\nbelief varies widely in different stages of mental development. Thus a\r\nsavage who is ill frames an ideal reconstruction of the causes of his\r\nillness, and attributes it to the hostile magic of an enemy. In\r\nignorance of pathology he is satisfied with this explanation, and\r\nactually _believes_ in it, whereas such a hypothesis in the mind of\r\ncivilized man would be treated as a pure effort of imagination, or even\r\nas a hallucination. It follows that the distinction between imagination\r\nand belief depends in practice on knowledge, social environment,\r\ntraining and the like.\r\n\r\nAlthough, however, the absence of objective restraint, i.e. a certain\r\nunreality, is characteristic of imagination, none the less it has great\r\npractical importance as a purely ideational activity. Its very freedom\r\nfrom objective limitation makes it a source of pleasure and pain. A\r\nperson of vivid imagination suffers acutely from the imagination of\r\nperils besetting a friend. In fact in some cases the ideal construction\r\nis so \"real\" that specific physical manifestations occur, as though\r\nimagination had passed into belief or the events imagined were actually\r\nin progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMAM, an Arabic word, meaning \"leader\" or \"guide\" in the sense of a\r\n\"pattern whose example is followed, whether for good or bad.\" Thus it is\r\napplied to the Koran, to a builder's level and plumb-line, to a road, to\r\na school-boy's daily task, to a written record. It is used in several of\r\nthese, senses in the Koran, but specifically several times of leaders\r\nand (ii. 118) of Abraham, \"Lo, I make thee a pattern for mankind.\"\r\n_Imam_ thus became the name of the head of the Moslem community, whose\r\nleadership and patternhood, as in the case of Mahomet himself, is to be\r\nregarded as of the widest description. His duty is to be the lieutenant,\r\nthe Caliph (q.v.) of the Prophet, to guard the faith and maintain the\r\ngovernment of the state. Round the origin and basis of his office all\r\ncontroversies as to the Moslem state centre. The Sunnites hold that it\r\nis for men to appoint and that the basis is obedience to the general\r\nusage of the Moslem peoples from the earliest times. The necessity for\r\nleaders has always been recognized, and a leader has always been\r\nappointed. The basis is thus agreement in the technical sense (see\r\nMAHOMMEDAN LAW), not Koran nor tradition from Mahomet nor analogy. The\r\nShi'ites in general hold that the appointment lies with God, through the\r\nProphet or otherwise, and that He always has appointed. The Kharijites\r\ntheoretically recognize no absolute need of an Imam; he is convenient\r\nand allowable. The Motazilites held that reason, not agreement, dictated\r\nthe appointment. Another distinction between the Sunnites and the\r\nShi'ites is that the Sunnites regard the Imam as liable to err, and to\r\nbe obeyed even though he personally sins, provided he maintains the\r\nordinances of Islam. Effective leadership is the essential point. But\r\nthe Shi'ites believe that the divinely appointed Imam is also divinely\r\nillumined and preserved (_ma'sum_) from sin. The above is called the\r\ngreater Imamate. The lesser Imamate is the leadership in the Friday\r\nprayers. This was originally performed by the Imam in the first sense,\r\nwho not only led in prayers but delivered a sermon (_khutba_); but with\r\nthe growth of the Moslem empire and the retirement of the caliph from\r\npublic life, it was necessarily given over to a deputy--part of a\r\ngradual process of putting the Imamate or caliphate into commission.\r\nThese deputy Imams are, in Turkey, ministers of the state, each in\r\ncharge of his own parish; they issue passports, &c., and perform the\r\nrites of circumcision, marriage and burial. In Persia among Shi'ites\r\ntheir position is more purely spiritual, and they are independent of the\r\nstate. A few of their leaders are called _Mujtahids_, i.e. capable of\r\ngiving an independent opinion on questions of religion and canon law. A\r\nthird use of the term Imam is as an honorary title. It is thus applied\r\nto leading theologians, e.g. to Abu Hanifa, ash-Shafi'i, Malik ibn Anas,\r\nAhmad ibn Hanbal (these are called \"the four Imams\"), Ghazali.\r\n\r\n  See McG. de Slane's transl. of Ibn Khaldun's _Prolégomènes_, i. 384\r\n  seq., 402 seq., 426 seq., 445; iii. 35, 58 seq.; Ostrorog's transl. of\r\n  Mawardi's _Ahkam_ i. 89 seq.; Haarbrücker's transl. of Shahrastani by\r\n  index; Juynboll's _De Mohammedanische Wet_, 316 seq.; Sell's _Faith of\r\n  Islam_, 95 seq.; Macdonald's _Development of Muslim Theology_, 56 seq.\r\n       (D.

In the simpler type of roof the\r\nimbrex is semicircular, but in some of the Greek temples it has vertical\r\nsides and an angular top. In the temple of Apollo at Bassae, where the\r\ntiles were in Parian marble, the imbrex on one side of the tile and the\r\ntile were worked in one piece out of the solid marble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMBROS, a Turkish island in the Aegean, at the southern end of the\r\nThracian Chersonese peninsula. It forms with Samothrace, about 17 m.\r\ndistant, a caza (or canton) in the sanjak of Lemnos and province of the\r\nArchipelago Isles. Herodotus (v. 26) mentions it as an abode of the\r\nhistoric Pelasgians (q.v.). It was, like Samothrace, a seat of the\r\nworship of the Cabeiri (q.v.). The island is now the seat of a Greek\r\nbishopric. There is communication with the mainland by occasional\r\nvessels. The island is of great fertility--wheat, oats, barley, olives,\r\nsesame and valonia being the principal products, in addition to a\r\nvariety of fruits. Pop. about 92,000, nearly all Turks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMERETIA, or IMERITIA a district in Russian Transcaucasia, extends from\r\nthe left bank of the river Tskheniz-Tskhali to the Suram range, which\r\nseparates it from Georgia on the east, and is bounded on the south by\r\nAkhaltsikh, and thus corresponds roughly to the eastern part of the\r\nmodern government of Kutais. Anciently a part of Colchis, and included\r\nin Lazia during the Roman empire, Imeretia was nominally under the\r\ndominion of the Greek emperors. In the early part of the 6th century it\r\nbecame the theatre of wars between the Byzantine emperor Justinian and\r\nChosroes, or Khosrau, king of Persia. Between 750 and 985 it was ruled\r\nby a dynasty (Apkhaz) of native princes, but was devastated by hostile\r\nincursions, reviving only after it became united to Georgia. It\r\nflourished until the reign of Queen Thamar, but after her death (1212)\r\nthe country became impoverished through strife and internal dissensions.\r\nIt was reunited with Georgia from 1318 to 1346, and again in 1424. But\r\nthe union only lasted forty-five years; from 1469 until 1810 it was\r\ngoverned by a Bagratid dynasty, closely akin to that which ruled over\r\nGeorgia. In 1621 it made the earliest appeal to Russia for aid; in 1650\r\nit acknowledged Russian suzerainty and in 1769 a Russian force expelled\r\nthe Turks. In 1803 the monarch declared himself a vassal of Russia, and\r\nin 1810 the little kingdom was definitively annexed to that empire.

Debus (_Ann._ 1858, 107, p.\r\n254) by the action of ammonia on glyoxal, 2C2H2O2 + 2NH3 = C3H4N2 +\r\nH2CO2 + 2H2O. The compounds of this series may be prepared by the\r\ncondensation of ortho-diketones with ammonia and aldehydes\r\n\r\n                                      R·C - N \\\\\r\n  R·CO·CO·R + 2NH3 + R´·CHO = 3H2O +   ||      \\\\ C·R´;\r\n                                      R·C - NH /\r\n\r\nfrom thioimidazolones by oxidation with dilute nitric acid (W.\r\nMarckwald, _Ber._, 1892, 25, p. 2361); by distillation of hydrobenzamide\r\nand similarly constituted bodies; and by the action of phosphorus\r\npentachloride on symmetrical dimethyloxamide, a methylchlorglyoxaline\r\nbeing formed (O. Wallach, _Ann._, 1877, 184, p. 500).\r\n\r\nThe glyoxalines are basic in character, and the imide hydrogen is\r\nreplaceable by metals and alkyl groups. They are stable towards reducing\r\nagents, and acidyl groups are only introduced with difficulty.\r\n\r\n  _Imidazole_ (glyoxaline), C3H4N2, crystallizes in thick prisms which\r\n  melt at 88-89° C. and boil at 253° C., and are readily soluble in\r\n  alcohol and in water. It is unaffected by chromic acid, but potassium\r\n  permanganate oxidizes it to formic acid. It forms salts with acids.\r\n\r\n  _Lophine_ (triphenylglyoxaline),\r\n\r\n    C6H5·C-N  \\\\\r\n         ||    \\\\ C·C6H5,\r\n    C6H5·C-NH  /\r\n\r\n  is formed by the dry distillation of hydrobenzamide, or by saturating\r\n  an alcoholic solution of benzil and benzaldehyde (at a temperature of\r\n  40° C.) with ammonia. It crystallizes in needles which melt at 275° C.\r\n  It is a weak base. When heated to 300° C. with hydriodic acid and\r\n  hydrochloric acid, in the presence of some red phosphorus, it yields\r\n  benzoic acid.\r\n\r\n  The keto-glyoxalines are known as imidazolones and are prepared by the\r\n  action of acids on acetalyl thioureas (W. Marckwald, Ber., 1892, 25,\r\n  p. 2357). _Benzimidazole_,\r\n\r\n          / N \\\\\r\n    C6H4 /     \\\\ CH,\r\n         \\  NH /\r\n\r\n  is the simplest representative of the benzoglyoxalines and is prepared\r\n  by the condensation of formic acid with ortho-phenylene diamine.

Bamberger, _Ann._, 1893, 273, p. 338).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMITATION (Lat. _imitatio_, from _imitari_, to imitate), the\r\nreproduction or repetition of an action or thought as observed in\r\nanother person or in oneself, or the construction of one object in the\r\nlikeness of another. By some writers (e.g. Preyer and Lloyd Morgan) the\r\nterm \"imitation\" is limited to cases in which one person copies the\r\naction or thought of another; others have preferred a wider use of the\r\nterm (i.e. including \"self-imitation\"), and have attempted to classify\r\nimitative action into various groupings, e.g. as cases of \"conscious\r\nimitation,\" \"imitative suggestion,\" \"plastic imitation\" (as when the\r\nmembers of a crowd subconsciously reproduce one another's modes of\r\nthought and action), and the like. The main distinction is that which\r\ntakes into account the question of attention (q.v.). In _conscious_\r\nimitation, the attention is fixed on the act and its reproduction: in\r\n_unconscious_ imitation the reproduction is entirely mechanical and the\r\nagent does not \"attend\" to the action or thought which he is copying: in\r\n_subconscious_ imitation the action is not deliberate, though the\r\nnecessary train of thought would immediately follow if the attention\r\nwere turned upon it under normal conditions. Imitation plays an\r\nextremely important part in human and animal development, and a clear\r\nunderstanding of its character is important both for the study of\r\nprimitive peoples, and also in the theories of education, art and\r\nsociology. The child's early development is in large measure imitative:\r\nthus the first articulate sounds and the first movements are mainly\r\nreproductions of the words and actions of parents, and even in the later\r\nstages that teacher is likely to achieve the best results who himself\r\ngives examples of how a word should be pronounced or an action done. The\r\nimpulse to imitate is, however, not confined to children: there is among\r\nthe majority of adults a tendency to assimilate themselves either to\r\ntheir society or to those whom they especially admire or respect: this\r\ntendency to shun the eccentric is rooted deeply in human psychology.\r\nMoreover, even among highly developed persons the imitative impulse\r\nfrequently overrides the reason, as when an audience, a crowd, or even\r\npractically a whole community is carried away by a panic for which no\r\nadequate ground has been given, or when a cough or a yawn is imitated by\r\na company of people. Such cases may be compared with those of persons\r\nin mesmeric trances who mechanically copy a series of movements made by\r\nthe mesmerist. The universality of the imitative impulse has led many\r\npsychologists to regard it as an instinct (so William James, _Principles\r\nof Psychology_, ii. 408; cf. INSTINCT), and in that large class of\r\nimitative actions which have no obvious ulterior purpose the impulse\r\ncertainly appears to be instinctive in character. On the other hand\r\nwhere the imitator recognizes the particular effect of a process and\r\nimitates with the deliberate intention of producing the same effect, his\r\naction can scarcely be classed as instinctive. A considerable number of\r\npsychologists have distinguished imitative from instinctive actions\r\n(e.g. Baldwin, and Sully). According to Darwin the imitative impulse\r\nbegins in infants at the age of four months. It is to be noted, however,\r\nthat the child imitates, not every action indiscriminately, but\r\nespecially those towards which it has a congenital tendency. The same is\r\ntrue of animals: though different kinds of animals may live in close\r\nproximity, the young of each kind imitate primarily the actions of their\r\nown parents.\r\n\r\nAmong primitive man imitation plays a very important part. The savage\r\nbelieves that he can bring about events by imitating them. He makes, for\r\ninstance, an image of his enemy and pierces it with darts or burns it,\r\nbelieving that by so doing he will cause his enemy's death: similarly\r\nsailors would whistle, or farmers would pour water on the ground, in the\r\nhope of producing wind or rain. This form of imitation is known as\r\nsympathetic magic (see MAGIC). The sociological importance of imitation\r\nis elaborately investigated by Gabriel Tarde (_Les Lois de l'imitation_,\r\n2nd ed., 1895), who bases all social evolution on the imitative impulse.\r\nHe distinguishes \"custom imitations,\" i.e. imitations of ancient or even\r\nforgotten actions, and \"mode imitations,\" i.e. imitations of current\r\nfashions. New discoveries are, in his scheme, the product of the\r\nconflict of imitations. This theory, though of great value, seems to\r\nneglect original natural similarities which, by the law of causation,\r\nproduce similar consequences, where imitation is geographically or\r\nchronologically impossible.\r\n\r\nThe term \"imitation\" has also the following special uses:--\r\n\r\n1. _In Art-theory._--According to Plato all artistic production is a\r\nform of imitation ([Greek: mimêsis]). That which really exists is the\r\nidea or type created by God; of this type all concrete objects are\r\nrepresentations, while the painter, the tragedian, the musician are\r\nmerely imitators, thrice removed from the truth (_Rep._ x. 596 seq.).\r\nSuch persons are represented by Plato as a menace to the moral fibre of\r\nthe community (_Rep._ iii.), as performing no useful function, drawing\r\nmen away from reality and pandering to the irrational side of the soul.\r\nAll art should aim at moral improvement. Plato clearly intends by\r\n\"imitation\" more than is connotated by the modern word: though in\r\ngeneral he associates with it all that is bad and second-rate, he in\r\nsome passages admits the value of the imitation of that which is good,\r\nand thus assigns to it a certain symbolic significance. Aristotle,\r\nlikewise regarding art as imitation, emphasizes its purely artistic\r\nvalue as purging the emotions ([Greek: katharsis]), and producing\r\nbeautiful things as such (see AESTHETICS and FINE ARTS).\r\n\r\n2. _In Biology_, the term is sometimes applied to the assimilation by\r\none species of certain external characteristics (especially colour)\r\nwhich enable them to escape the notice of other species which would\r\notherwise prey upon them. It is a form of protective resemblance and is\r\ngenerally known as mimicry (q.v.; see also COLOURS OF ANIMALS).\r\n\r\n3. _In Music_, the term \"imitation\" is applied in contrapuntal\r\ncomposition to the repetition of a passage in one or more of the other\r\nvoices or parts of a composition. When the repetition is note for note\r\nwith all the intervals the same, the imitation is called \"strict\" and\r\nbecomes a canon (q.v.); if not it is called \"free,\" the latter being\r\nmuch the more common. There are many varieties of imitation, known as\r\nimitation \"by inversion,\" \"by inversion and reversion,\" \"by\r\naugmentation,\" \"by diminution\" (see _Grove's Dictionary of Music, s.\r\nv._, and textbooks of musical theory).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMITATION OF CHRIST, THE (_Imitatio Christi_), the title of a famous\r\nmedieval Christian devotional work, much used still by both Catholics\r\nand Protestants and usually ascribed to Thomas à Kempis. The\r\n\"Contestation\" over the author of the _Imitation of Christ_ is probably\r\nthe most considerable and famous controversy that has ever been carried\r\non concerning a purely literary question. It has been going on almost\r\nwithout flagging for three centuries, and nearly 200 combatants have\r\nentered the lists. In the present article nothing is said on the history\r\nof the controversy, but an attempt is made to summarize the results that\r\nmay be looked on as definitely acquired.\r\n\r\nUntil quite recently there were three candidates in the field--Thomas à\r\nKempis (1380-1471), a canon regular of Mount St Agnes in Zwolle, in the\r\ndiocese of Utrecht, of the Windesheim Congregation of Augustinian\r\nCanons; John Gerson (1363-1429), chancellor of the University of Paris;\r\nand an abbot, John Gersen, said to have been abbot of a Benedictine\r\nmonastery at Vercelli in the 12th century. Towards the end of the 15th\r\ncentury the _Imitation_ circulated under the names of the first two; but\r\nGerson is an impossible author, and his claims have never found\r\ndefenders except in France, where they are no longer urged. The\r\nBenedictine abbot Gersen is an absolutely mythical personage, a mere\r\n\"double\" of the chancellor. Consequently at the present day the question\r\nis narrowed to the issue: Thomas à Kempis, or an unknown author.\r\n\r\nThe following is a statement of the facts that may be received as\r\ncertain:--\r\n\r\n1. The earliest-known dated MS. of the _Imitation_ is of 1424--it\r\ncontains only Bk. I.; the earliest MSS. of the whole work of certain\r\ndate are of 1427. Probably some of the undated MSS. are older; but it is\r\nthe verdict of the most competent modern expert opinion that there is no\r\npalaeographical reason for suspecting that any known MS. is earlier than\r\nthe first quarter of the 15th century.\r\n\r\n2. A Latin letter of a Dutch canon regular, named Johann van\r\nSchoonhoven, exhibits such a close connexion with Bk. I. that plagiarism\r\non the one side or the other is the only possible explanation. It is\r\ncapable of demonstration that the author of the _Imitation_ was the\r\nborrower, and that the opposite hypothesis is inadmissible. Now, this\r\nletter can be shown to have been written after 1382. Therefore Bk. I.\r\nwas beyond controversy written between the years 1382 and 1424.\r\n\r\n3. It is not here assumed that the four treatises formed a single work,\r\nor even that they are all by the same author; and the date of the other\r\nthree books cannot be fixed with the same certainty. But, on the one\r\nhand, before the beginning of the 15th century there is no trace\r\nwhatever of their existence--a strong argument that they did not yet\r\nexist; and on the other hand, after 1424 nearly each year produces its\r\nquota of MSS. and other signs of the existence of these books become\r\nfrequent. Moreover, as a matter of fact, the four treatises did commonly\r\ncirculate together. The presumption is strong that Bks. II., III., IV.,\r\nlike Bk. I., were composed shortly before they were put into\r\ncirculation.\r\n\r\nIt may then be taken as proved that the _Imitation_ was composed between\r\n1380 and 1425, and probably towards the end rather than the beginning of\r\nthat period. Having ascertained the date, we must consider the\r\nbirthplace.\r\n\r\n4. A number of idioms and turns of expression throughout the book show\r\nthat its author belonged to some branch of the Teutonic race. Further\r\nthan this the argument does not lead; for when the dialects of the early\r\n15th century are considered it cannot be said that the expressions in\r\nquestion are Netherlandic rather than German--as a matter of fact, they\r\nhave all been paralleled out of High German dialects.\r\n\r\n5. Of the 400 MSS. of the _Imitation_ 340 come from the Teutonic\r\ncountries--another argument in favour of its Teutonic origin. Again, 100\r\nof them, including the earliest, come from the Netherlands. This number\r\nis quite disproportionate to the relative size of the Netherlands, and\r\nso points to Holland as the country in which the _Imitation_ was first\r\nmost widely circulated and presumably composed.\r\n\r\n6. There is a considerable body of early evidence, traceable before\r\n1450, that the author was a canon regular.\r\n\r\n7. Several of the MSS. were written in houses belonging to the\r\nWindesheim Congregation of canons regular, or, in close touch with it.\r\nMoreover there is a specially intimate literary and spiritual\r\nrelationship between the _Imitation_ and writings that emanated from\r\nwhat has been called the \"Windesheim Circle.\"\r\n\r\nTo sum up: the indirect evidence points clearly to the conclusion that\r\nthe _Imitation_ was written by a Teutonic canon regular, probably a\r\nDutch canon regular of the Windesheim Congregation, in the first quarter\r\nof the 15th century. These data are satisfied by Thomas à Kempis.\r\n\r\nWe pass to the direct evidence, neglecting that of witnesses who had no\r\nspecial sources of information.\r\n\r\n8. There can be no question that in the Windesheim Congregation itself\r\nthere was already, during Thomas à Kempis's lifetime, a fixed tradition\r\nthat he was the author of the _Imitation_. The most important witness to\r\nthis tradition is Johann Busch. It is true that the crucial words are\r\nmissing in one copy of his \"Chronicle\"; but it is clear there were two\r\nredactions of the work, and there are no grounds whatever for doubting\r\nthat the second with its various enlargements came from the hands of\r\nBusch himself--a copy of it containing the passage exists written in\r\n1464, while both Busch and Thomas à Kempis were still alive. Busch\r\npassed a great part of his life in Windesheim, only a few miles from\r\nMount St Agnes where Thomas lived. It would be hard to find a more\r\nauthentic witness. Another witness is Hermann Rhyd, a German member of\r\nthe Windesheim Congregation, who also had personally known Thomas.\r\nBesides, two or three MSS. originating in the Windesheim Congregation\r\nstate or imply the same tradition.\r\n\r\n9. More than this: the tradition existed in Thomas à Kempis's own\r\nmonastery shortly after his death. For John Mauburne became a canon in\r\nMount St Agnes within a few years of Thomas's death, and he states more\r\nthan once that Thomas wrote the _Imitation_.\r\n\r\n10. The earliest biographer of Thomas à Kempis was an anonymous\r\ncontemporary: the _Life_ was printed in 1494, but it exists in a MS. of\r\n1488. The biographer says he got his information from the brethren at\r\nMount St Agnes, and he states in passing that Bk. III. was written by\r\nThomas. Moreover, he appends a list of Thomas's writings, 38 in number,\r\nand 5-8 are the four books of the _Imitation_.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to point out that such a list must be of vastly greater\r\nauthority than those given by St Jerome or Gennadius in their _De Viris\r\nIllustribus_, and its rejection must, in consistency, involve methods of\r\ncriticism that would work havoc in the history of early literature of\r\nwhat king soever. The domestic tradition in the Windesheim Congregation,\r\nand in Mount St Agnes itself, has a weight that cannot be legitimately\r\navoided or evaded. Indeed the external authority for Thomas's authorship\r\nis stronger than that for the authorship of most really anonymous\r\nbooks--such, that is, as neither themselves claim to be by a given\r\nauthor, nor have been claimed by any one as his own. A large proportion\r\nof ancient writings, both ecclesiastical and secular, are\r\nunquestioningly assigned to writers on far less evidence than that for\r\nThomas's authorship of the _Imitation_.\r\n\r\nInternal arguments have been urged against Thomas's authorship. It has\r\nbeen said that his certainly authentic writings are so inferior that the\r\n_Imitation_ could not have been written by the same author. But only if\r\nthey were of the most certain and peremptory nature could such internal\r\narguments be allowed to weigh against the clear array of facts that make\r\nup the external argument in favour of à Kempis. And it cannot be said\r\nthat the internal difficulties are such as this. Let it be granted that\r\nThomas was a prolific writer and that his writings vary very much in\r\nquality; let it be granted also that the _Imitation_ surpasses all the\r\nrest, and that some are on a level very far below it; still, when at\r\ntheir best, some of the other works are not unworthy of the author of\r\nthe _Imitation_.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is the belief of the present writer that the\r\n\"Contestation\" is over, and that Thomas à Kempis's claims to the\r\nauthorship of the _Imitation_ have been solidly established.\r\n\r\n  The best account in English of the Controversy is that given by F. R.\r\n  Cruise in his _Thomas à Kempis_ (1887). Works produced before 1880 are\r\n  in general, with the exception of those of Eusebius Amort,\r\n  superannuated, and deal in large measure with points no longer of any\r\n  living interest. A pamphlet by Cruise, _Who was the Author of the\r\n  Imitation?_ (1898) contains sufficient information on the subject for\r\n  all ordinary needs; it has been translated into French and German, and\r\n  may be regarded as the standard handbook.\r\n\r\n  It has been said that the _Imitation of Christ_ has had a wider\r\n  religious influence than any book except the Bible, and if the\r\n  statement be limited to Christendom, it is probably true. The\r\n  _Imitation_ has been translated into over fifty languages, and is said\r\n  to have run through more than 6000 editions. The other statement,\r\n  often made, that it sums up all that is best of earlier Western\r\n  mysticism--that in it \"was gathered and concentered all that was\r\n  elevating, passionate, profoundly pious in all the older mystics\"\r\n  (Milman) is an exaggeration that is but partially true, for it\r\n  depreciates unduly the elder mystics and fails to do justice to the\r\n  originality of the _Imitation_. For its spiritual teaching is\r\n  something quite different from the mysticism of Augustine in the\r\n  _Confessions_, or of Bernard in the _Sermons on the Song of Songs_; it\r\n  is different from the scholastic mysticism of the St Victors or\r\n  Bonaventure; above all, it is different from the obscure mysticism,\r\n  saturated with the pseudo-Dionysian Neoplatonism of the German school\r\n  of Eckhart, Suso, Tauler and Ruysbroek. Again, it is quite different\r\n  from the later school of St Teresa and St John of the Cross, and from\r\n  the introspective methods of what may be called the modern school of\r\n  spirituality. The _Imitation_ stands apart, unique, as the principal\r\n  and most representative utterance of a special phase of religious\r\n  thought--non-scholastic, non-platonic, positive and merely religious\r\n  in its scope--herein reflecting faithfully the spirit of the movement\r\n  initiated by Gerhard Groot (q.v.), and carried forward by the circles\r\n  in which Thomas à Kempis lived. In contrast with more mystical\r\n  writings it is of limpid clearness, every sentence being easily\r\n  understandable by all whose spiritual sense is in any degree awakened.\r\n  No doubt it owes its universal power to this simplicity, to its\r\n  freedom from intellectualism and its direct appeal to the religious\r\n  sense and to the extraordinary religious genius of its author.\r\n  Professor Harnack in his book _What is Christianity?_ counts the\r\n  _Imitation_ as one of the chief spiritual forces in Catholicism: it\r\n  \"kindles independent religious life, and a fire which burns with a\r\n  flame of its own\" (p. 266).\r\n\r\n  The best Latin edition of the _Imitation_ is that of Hirsche (1874),\r\n  which follows closely the autograph of 1441 and reproduces the\r\n  rhythmical character of the book. Of English translations the most\r\n  interesting is that by John Wesley, under the title _The Christian's\r\n  Pattern_ (1735).     (E. C. B.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMMACULATE CONCEPTION, THE. This dogma of the Roman Catholic Church was\r\ndefined, as \"of faith\" by Pope Pius IX. on the 8th of December 1854 in\r\nthe following terms: \"The doctrine which holds that the Blessed Virgin\r\nMary, from the first instant of her conception, was, by a most singular\r\ngrace and privilege of Almighty God, in view of the merits of Jesus\r\nChrist, the Redeemer of the human race, preserved from all stain of\r\nOriginal Sin, is a doctrine revealed, by God, and therefore to be firmly\r\nand steadfastly believed by all the faithful.\"[1] These words presuppose\r\nthe distinction between original, or racial, and actual, or personally\r\nincurred sin. There is no dispute that the Church has always held the\r\nBlessed Virgin to be sinless, in the sense of actual or personal sin.\r\nThe question of the Immaculate Conception regards original or racial sin\r\nonly. It is admitted that the doctrine as defined by Pius IX. was not\r\nexplicitly mooted before the 12th century. But it is claimed that it is\r\nimplicitly contained in the teaching of the Fathers. Their expressions\r\non the subject of the sinlessness of Mary are, it is pointed out, so\r\nample and so absolute that they must be taken to include original sin as\r\nwell as actual. Thus we have in the first five centuries such epithets\r\napplied to her as \"in every respect holy,\" \"in all things unstained,\"\r\n\"super-innocent\" and \"singularly holy\"; she is compared to Eve before\r\nthe fall, as ancestress of a redeemed people; she is \"the earth before\r\nit was accursed.\"[2] The well-known words of St Augustine (d. 430) may\r\nbe cited: \"As regards the mother of God,\" he says, \"I will not allow any\r\nquestion whatever of sin.\"[3] It is true that he is here speaking\r\ndirectly of actual or personal sin. But his argument is that all men are\r\nsinners; that they are so through original depravity; that this original\r\ndepravity may be overcome by the grace of God, and he adds that he does\r\nnot know but that Mary may have had sufficient grace to overcome sin \"of\r\nevery sort\" (_omni ex parte_).\r\n\r\nIt seems to have been St Bernard who, in the 12th century, explicitly\r\nraised the question of the Immaculate Conception. A feast of the\r\nConception of the Blessed Virgin had already begun to be celebrated in\r\nsome churches of the West. St Bernard blames the canons of the\r\nmetropolitan church of Lyons for instituting such a festival without the\r\npermission of the Holy See. In doing so, he takes occasion to repudiate\r\naltogether the view that the Conception of Mary was sinless. It is\r\ndoubtful, however, whether he was using the term \"Conception\" in the\r\nsame sense in which it is used in the definition of Pius IX. In speaking\r\nof conception one of three things may be meant: (1) the mother's\r\nco-operation; (2) the formation of the body, or (3) the completion of\r\nthe human being by the infusion of the rational or spiritual soul. In\r\nearly times conception was very commonly used in the first\r\nsense--\"active\" conception as it was called. But it is in the second, or\r\nrather the third, sense that the word is employed in modern usage, and\r\nin the definition of Pope Pius IX. But St Bernard would seem to have\r\nbeen speaking of conception in the first sense, for in his argument he\r\nsays, \"How can there be absence of sin where there is concupiscence\r\n(_libido_)?\" and stronger expressions follow, showing that he is\r\nspeaking of the mother and not of the child.[4]\r\n\r\nSt Thomas Aquinas, the greatest of the medieval scholastics, refused to\r\nadmit the Immaculate Conception, on the ground that, unless the Blessed\r\nVirgin had at one time or other been one of the sinful, she could not\r\njustly be said to have been redeemed by Christ.[5] St Bonaventura (d.\r\n1274), second only to St Thomas in his influence on the Christian\r\nschools of his age, hesitated to accept it for a similar reason.[6] The\r\ncelebrated John Duns Scotus (d. 1308), a Franciscan like St Bonaventura,\r\nargued, on the contrary, that from a rational point of view it was\r\ncertainly as little derogatory to the merits of Christ to assert that\r\nMary was by him preserved from all taint of sin, as to say that she\r\nfirst contracted it and then was delivered.[7] His arguments, combined\r\nwith a better acquaintance with the language of the early Fathers,\r\ngradually prevailed in the schools of the Western Church. In 1387 the\r\nuniversity of Paris strongly condemned the opposite view. In 1483 Pope\r\nSixtus IV., who had already (1476) emphatically approved of the feast of\r\nthe Conception, condemned those who ventured to assert that the doctrine\r\nof the Immaculate Conception was heretical, and forbade either side to\r\nclaim a decisive victory until further action on the part of the Holy\r\nSee. The council of Trent, after declaring that in its decrees on the\r\nsubject of original sin it did not include \"the blessed and immaculate\r\nVirgin Mary, Mother of God,\" renewed this prohibition.[8] Pope Paul V.\r\n(d. 1651) ordered that no one, under severe penalties, should dare to\r\nassent in public \"acts\" or disputations that the Blessed Virgin was\r\nconceived in original sin. Pope Gregory XV., shortly afterwards,\r\nextended this prohibition to private discussions, allowing, however, the\r\nDominicans to argue on the subjects among themselves. Clement XI., in\r\n1708, extended the feast of the Conception to the whole Church as a holy\r\nday of obligation. Long before the middle of the 19th century the\r\ndoctrine was universally taught in the Roman Catholic Church. During the\r\nreign of Gregory XVI. the bishops in various countries began to press\r\nfor a definition. Pius IX., at the beginning of his pontificate, and\r\nagain after 1851, appointed commissions to investigate the whole\r\nsubject, and he was advised that the doctrine was one which could be\r\ndefined and that the time for a definition was opportune. On the 8th of\r\nDecember 1854 in a great assembly of bishops, in the basilica of St\r\nPeter's at Rome, he promulgated the Bull _Ineffabilis Deus_, in which\r\nthe history of the doctrine is summarily traced, and which contains the\r\ndefinition as given above.\r\n\r\nThe festival of the Conception of the Blessed Virgin, as distinct from\r\nher Nativity, was certainly celebrated in the Greek Church in the 7th\r\ncentury, as we learn from one of the canons of St Andrew of Crete (or of\r\nJerusalem) who died about A.D. 700.[9] There is some evidence that it\r\nwas kept in Spain in the time of St Ildefonsus of Toledo (d. 667) and in\r\nsouthern Italy before A.D. 1000. In England it was known in the 12th\r\ncentury; a council of the province of Canterbury, in 1328, ascribes its\r\nintroduction to St Anselm. It spread to France and Germany in the same\r\ncentury. It was extended to the whole church, as stated above, in 1708.\r\nIt is kept, in the Western Church, on the 8th of December; the Greeks\r\nhave always kept it one day later.\r\n\r\n  The chief répertoire of Patristic passages, both on the doctrine and\r\n  on the festival, is Father Charles Passaglia's great collection,\r\n  entitled _De immaculato Deiparae semper Virginis conceptu Caroli\r\n  Passaglia sac. S.J. commentarius_ (3 vols., Romae, 1854-1855).\r\n\r\n  A useful statement of the doctrine with numerous references to the\r\n  Fathers and scholastics is found in Hürter's _Theologia Dogmatica_\r\n  (5th ed.), tom. i. tract. vii. cap. 6, p. 438.\r\n\r\n  The state of Catholic belief in the middle of the 19th century is well\r\n  brought out in _La Croyance générale el constante de l'Église touchant\r\n  l'immaculée conception de la bienheureuse Vierge Marie_, published in\r\n  1855 by Thomas M. J. Gousset (1792-1866), professor of moral theology\r\n  at the grand seminary of Besançon, and successively archbishop of\r\n  Besançon and cardinal archbishop of Reims.\r\n\r\n  For English readers the doctrine, and the history of its definition,\r\n  is clearly stated by Archbishop Ullathorne in _The Immaculate\r\n  Conception of the Mother of God_ (2nd ed., London, 1904). Dr F. G.\r\n  Lee, in _The Sinless Conception of the Mother of God; a Theological\r\n  Essay_ (London, 1891) argued that the doctrine of the Immaculate\r\n  Conception is a legitimate development of early church teaching.\r\n       (+J.

Its most important\r\nuse is for the theological conception of God as existing in and\r\nthroughout the created world, as opposed, for example, to Deism (q.v.),\r\nwhich conceives Him as separate from and above the universe. This\r\nconception has been expressed in a great variety of forms (see THEISM,\r\nPANTHEISM). It should be observed that the immanence doctrine need not\r\npreclude the belief in the transcendence of God: thus God may be\r\nregarded as above the world (transcendent) and at the same time as\r\npresent in and pervading it (immanent). The immanence doctrine has\r\narisen from two main causes, the one metaphysical, the other religious.\r\nMetaphysical speculation on the relation of matter and mind has\r\nnaturally led to a conviction of an underlying unity of all existence,\r\nand so to a metaphysical identification of God and the universe: when\r\nthis identification proceeds to the length of expressing the universe as\r\nmerely a mode or form of deity the result is pantheism (cf. the\r\nEleatics): when it regards the deity as simply the sum of the forces of\r\nnature (cf. John Toland) the result is naturalism. In either case, but\r\nespecially in the former, it frequently becomes pure mysticism (q.v.).\r\nReligious thinkers are faced by the problem of the Creator and the\r\ncreated, and the necessity for formulating a close relationship between\r\nGod and man, the Infinite and Perfect with the finite and imperfect. The\r\nconception of God as wholly external to man, a purely mechanical theory\r\nof the creation, is throughout Christendom regarded as false to the\r\nteaching of the New Testament as also to Christian experience. The\r\ncontrary view has gained ground in some quarters (cf. the so-called \"New\r\nTheology\" of Rev. R. J. Campbell) so far as to postulate a divine\r\nelement in human beings, so definitely bridging over the gap between\r\nfinite and infinite which was to some extent admitted by the bulk of\r\nearly Christian teachers. In support of such a view are adduced not only\r\nthe metaphysical difficulty of postulating any relationship between the\r\ninfinite and the purely finite, but also the ethical problems of the\r\nnature of human goodness--i.e. how a merely human being could appreciate\r\nthe nature of or display divine goodness--and the epistemological\r\nproblem of explaining how finite mind can cognize the infinite. The\r\ndevelopment of the immanence theory of God has coincided with the deeper\r\nrecognition of the essentially spiritual nature of deity as contrasted\r\nwith the older semi-pagan conception found very largely in the Old\r\nTestament of God as primarily a mighty ruler, obedience to whom is\r\ncomparable with that of a subject to an absolute monarch: the idea of\r\nthe dignity of man in virtue of his immediate relation with God may be\r\ntraced in great measure to the humanist movement of the 14th and 15th\r\ncenturies (cf. the Inner Light doctrine of Johann Tauler). In later\r\ntimes the conception of conscience as an inward monitor is symptomatic\r\nof the same movement of thought. In pure metaphysics the term\r\n\"immanence-philosophy\" is given to a doctrine held largely by German\r\nphilosophers (Rehmke, Leclair, Schuppe and others) according to which\r\nall reality is reduced to elements immanent in consciousness. This\r\ndoctrine is derived from Berkeley and Hume on the one hand and from\r\nKantianism on the other, and embodies the principle that nothing can\r\nexist for the mind save itself. The natural consequence of this theory\r\nis that the individual consciousness alone exists (solipsism): this\r\nposition is, however, open to the obvious criticism that in some cases\r\nindividual consciousnesses agree in their content. Schuppe, therefore,\r\npostulates a general consciousness (_Bewusstsein überhaupt_).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMMANUEL BEN SOLOMON (c. 1265-c. 1330), Hebrew poet, was born in Rome.\r\nHe was a contemporary and friend of Dante, and his verse shows the\r\ninfluence of the \"divine poet.\" Immanuel's early studies included\r\nscience, mathematics and philosophy; and his commentaries on Proverbs,\r\nPsalms, Job and other Biblical books are good examples of the current\r\nsymbolical methods which Dante so supremely used. Immanuel's fame\r\nchiefly rests on his poems, especially the collection (in the manner of\r\nHarizi, q.v.) entitled _Mehabberoth_, a series of 27 good-natured\r\nsatires on Jewish life. Religious and secular topics are\r\nindiscriminately interwoven, and severe pietists were offended by\r\nImmanuel's erotic style. Most popular is an additional section numbered\r\n28 (often printed by itself) called _Hell and Paradise_ (_ha-Tophet\r\nveha-Eden_). The poet is conducted by a certain Daniel (doubtfully\r\nidentified with Dante) through the realms of torture and bliss, and\r\nImmanuel's pictures and comments are at once vivid and witty.\r\n\r\n  See J. Chotzner, _Hebrew Humour_ (Lond., 1905), pp. 82-102.     (I. A.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMMERMANN, KARL LEBERECHT (1796-1840), German dramatist and novelist,\r\nwas born on the 24th of April 1796 at Magdeburg, the son of a government\r\nofficial. In 1813 he went to study law at Halle, where he remained,\r\nafter the suppression of the university by Napoleon in the same year,\r\nuntil King Frederick William's \"Summons to my people\" on March 17th. He\r\nresponded with alacrity, but was prevented by illness from taking part\r\nin the earlier campaign; he fought, however, in 1815 at Ligny and\r\nWaterloo, and marched into Paris with Blücher. At the conclusion of the\r\nwar he resumed his studies at Halle, and after being _Referendar_ in\r\nMagdeburg, was appointed in 1819 _Assessor_ at Münster in Westphalia.\r\nHere he made the acquaintance of Elise von Lützow, Countess von\r\nAhlefeldt, wife of the leader of the famous \"free corps\" (see Lützow).\r\nThis lady first inspired his pen, and their relationship is reflected in\r\nseveral dramas written about this time. In 1823 Immermann was appointed\r\njudge at Magdeburg, and in 1827 was transferred to Düsseldorf as\r\n_Landgerichtsrat_ or district judge. Thither the countess, whose\r\nmarriage had in the meantime been dissolved, followed him, and, though\r\nrefusing his hand, shared his home until his marriage in 1839 with a\r\ngrand-daughter of August Hermann Niemeyer (1754-1828), chancellor and\r\n_rector perpetuus_ of Halle university. In 1834 Immermann undertook the\r\nmanagement of the Düsseldorf theatre, and, although his resources were\r\nsmall, succeeded for two years in raising it to a high level of\r\nexcellence. The theatre, however, was insufficiently endowed to allow of\r\nhim carrying on the work, and in 1836 he returned to his official\r\nduties and literary pursuits. He died at Düsseldorf on the 25th of\r\nAugust 1840.\r\n\r\nImmermann had considerable aptitude for the drama, but it was long\r\nbefore he found a congenial field for his talents. His early plays are\r\nimitations, partly of Kotzebue's, partly of the Romantic dramas of Tieck\r\nand Müllner, and are now forgotten. In 1826, however, appeared _Cardenio\r\nund Celinde_, a love tragedy of more promise; this, as well as the\r\nearlier productions, awakened the ill-will of Platen, who made Immermann\r\nthe subject of his wittiest satire, _Der romantische Oedipus_. Between\r\n1827 and 1832 Immermann redeemed his good name by a series of historical\r\ntragedies, _Das Trauerspiel in Tirol_ (1827), _Kaiser Friedrich II._\r\n(1828) and a trilogy from Russian history, Alexis (1832). His\r\nmasterpiece is the poetic mystery, _Merlin_ (1831), a noble poem, which,\r\nlike its model, _Faust_, deals with the deeper problems of modern\r\nspiritual life. Immermann's important dramaturgic experiments in\r\nDüsseldorf are described in detail in _Düsseldörfer Anfänge_ (1840).\r\nMore significant is his position as a novelist. Here he clearly stands\r\non the boundary line between Romanticism and modern literature; his\r\n_Epigonen_ (1836) might be described as one of the last Romantic\r\nimitations of Goethe's _Wilhelm Meister_, while the satire and realism\r\nof his second novel, _Münchhausen_ (1838), form a complete break with\r\nthe older literature. As a prose-writer Immermann is perhaps best\r\nremembered to-day by the admirable story of village life, _Der Oberhof_,\r\nwhich is embedded in the formless mass of _Münchhausen_. His last work\r\nwas an unfinished epic, _Tristan und Isolde_ (1840).\r\n\r\n  Immermann's _Gesammelte Schriften_ were published in 14 vols. in\r\n  1835-1843; a new edition, with biography and introduction by R.\r\n  Boxberger, in 20 vols. (Berlin, 1883); selected works, edited by M.\r\n  Koch (4 vols., 1887-1888) and F. Muncker (6 vols., 1897).

The belief in human\r\nimmortality in some form is almost universal; even in early animistic\r\ncults the germ of the idea is present, and in all the higher religions\r\nit is an important feature. This article is confined to summarizing the\r\nphilosophical or scientific arguments for, and objections to, the\r\ndoctrine of the persistence of the human soul after death. For the\r\nChristian doctrine, see ESCHATOLOGY; and for other religions see the\r\nseparate articles.\r\n\r\nIn the Orphic mysteries \"the soul was regarded as a part of the divine,\r\na _particula aurae divinae_, for which the body in its limited and\r\nperishable condition was no fit organ, but a grave or prison ([Greek: to\r\nsôma sêma]). The existence of the soul in the body was its punishment\r\nfor sins in a previous condition; and the doom of its sins in the body\r\nwas its descent into other bodies, and the postponement of its\r\ndeliverance\" (Salmond's _Christian Doctrine of Immortality_, p. 109).\r\nThis deliverance was what the mysteries promised. A remarkable passage\r\nin Pindar (_Thren._ 2) is thus rendered by J. W. Donaldson (_Pindar's\r\nEpinician or Triumphal Odes_, p. 372). \"By a happy lot, all persons\r\ntravel to an end free of toil. And the body, indeed, is subject to the\r\npowerful influence of death; but a shadow of vitality is still left\r\nalive, and this alone is of divine origin; while our limbs are in\r\nactivity it sleeps; but, when we sleep, it discloses to the mind in many\r\ndreams the future judgment with regard to happiness and misery.\"\r\n\r\nThe belief of Socrates is uncertain. In the _Apology_ he is represented\r\nas sure that \"no evil can happen to a good man, either in life or after\r\ndeath,\" but as not knowing whether \"death be a state of nothingness and\r\nutter unconsciousness, or a change or migration of the soul from this\r\nworld to the next\" (i. 40, 41). In the _Phaedo_ a confident expectation\r\nis ascribed to him. He is not the body to be buried; he will not remain\r\nwith his friends after he has drunk the poison, but he will go away to\r\nthe happiness of the blessed. The silence of the _Memorabilia_ of\r\nXenophon must be admitted as an argument to the contrary; but the\r\nprobability seems to be that Plato did not in the _Phaedo_ altogether\r\nmisrepresent the Master. In Plato's thought the belief held a prominent\r\nposition. \"It is noteworthy,\" says Professor D. G. Ritchie, \"that, in\r\nthe various dialogues in which Plato speaks of immortality, the\r\narguments seem to be of different kinds, and most of them quite\r\nunconnected with one another.\" In the _Phaedrus_ (245 c) the argument\r\nis, that the soul is self-moving, and, therefore, immortal; and this\r\nargument is repeated in the _Laws_ (x. 894, 895). It is an argument that\r\nPlato probably inherited from Alcmaeon, the physician of Croton (Arist.\r\n_De An._ i. 2, § 17 405 A 29), whose views were closely connected with\r\nthose of the Pythagoreans. In the _Phaedo_ the main argument up to which\r\nall the others lead is that the soul participates in the idea of life.\r\nRecollection (_anamnesis_) alone would prove pre-existence, but not\r\nexistence after death. In the tenth book of the _Republic_ we find the\r\ncurious argument that the soul does not perish like the body, because\r\nits characteristic evil, sin or wickedness does not kill it as the\r\ndiseases of the body wear out the bodily life. In the _Timaeus_ (41 A)\r\nthe immortality even of the gods is made dependent on the will of the\r\nSupreme Creator; souls are not in their own nature indestructible, but\r\npersist because of His goodness. In the _Laws_ (xii. 959 A) the notion\r\nof a future life seems to be treated as a salutary doctrine which is to\r\nbe believed because the legislator enacts it (Plato, p. 146). The\r\nestimate to be formed of this reasoning has been well stated by Dr A. M.\r\nFairbairn, \"Plato's arguments for immortality, isolated, modernized, may\r\nbe feeble, even valueless, but allowed to stand where and as he himself\r\nputs them, they have an altogether different worth. The ratiocinative\r\nparts of the _Phaedo_ thrown into syllogisms may be easily demolished by\r\na hostile logician; but in the dialogue as a whole there is a subtle\r\nspirit and cumulative force which logic can neither seize nor answer\"\r\n(_Studies in the Philosophy of Religion_, p. 226, 1876).\r\n\r\nAristotle held that the [Greek: nous] or active intelligence alone is\r\nimmortal. The Stoics were not agreed upon the question. Cleanthes is\r\nsaid to have held that all survive to the great conflagration which\r\ncloses the cycle, Chrysippus that only the wise will. Marcus Aurelius\r\nteaches that even if the spirit survive for a time it is at last\r\n\"absorbed in the generative principle of the universe.\" Epicureanism\r\nthought that \"the wise man fears not death, before which most men\r\ntremble; for, if we are, it is not; if it is, we are not.\" Death is\r\nextinction. Augustine adopts a Platonic thought when he teaches that the\r\nimmortality of the soul follows from its participation in the eternal\r\ntruths. The Apologists themselves welcomed, and commended to others, the\r\nChristian revelation as affording a certainty of immortality such as\r\nreason could not give. The Aristotelian school in Islam did not speak\r\nwith one voice upon the question; Avicenna declared the soul immortal,\r\nbut Averroes assumes only the eternity of the universal intellect.\r\nAlbertus Magnus argued that the soul is immortal, as _ex se ipsa causa_,\r\nand as independent of the body; Pietro Pomponazzi maintained that the\r\nsoul's immortality could be neither proved nor disproved by any natural\r\nreasons. Spinoza, while consistently with his pantheism denying personal\r\nimmortality, affirms that \"the human mind cannot be absolutely destroyed\r\nwith the body, but there remains of it something which is eternal\"\r\n(_Eth._ v. prop, xxiii.). The reason he gives is that, as this something\r\n\"appertains to the essence of the mind,\" it is \"conceived by a certain\r\neternal necessity through the very essence of God.\"\r\n\r\nLeibnitz, in accord with the distinctive principle of his philosophy,\r\naffirmed the absolute independence of mind and body as distinct monads,\r\nthe parallelism of their functions in life being due to the\r\npre-established harmony. For the soul, by its nature as a single monad\r\nindestructible and, therefore, immortal, death meant only the loss of\r\nthe monads constituting the body and its return to the pre-existent\r\nstate. The argument of Ernst Platner (_Philos. Aphor._ i. 1174, 1178) is\r\nsimilar. \"If the human soul is a force in the narrower sense, a\r\nsubstance, and not a combination of substances, then, as in the nature\r\nof things there is no transition from existence to non-existence, we\r\ncannot naturally conceive the end of its existence, any more than we can\r\nanticipate a gradual annihilation of its existence.\" He adds a reason\r\nthat recalls one of Plato's, \"As manifestly as the human soul is by\r\nmeans of the senses linked to the present life, so manifestly it\r\nattaches itself by reason, and the conceptions, conclusions,\r\nanticipations and efforts to which reason leads it, to God and\r\neternity.\"\r\n\r\nAgainst the first kind of argument, as formulated by Moses Mendelssohn,\r\nKant advances the objection that, although we may deny the soul\r\nextensive quantity, division into parts, yet we cannot refuse to it\r\nintensive quantity, degrees of reality; and consequently its existence\r\nmay be terminated not by decomposition, but by gradual diminution of its\r\npowers (or to use the term he coined for the purpose, by\r\n_elanguescence_). This denial of any reasonable ground for belief in\r\nimmortality in the _Critique of Pure Reason_ (_Transcendental\r\nDialectic_, bk. ii. ch. i.) is, however, not his last word on the\r\nsubject. In the _Critique of the Practical Reason_ (_Dialectic_, ch. i.\r\nsec. iv) the immortality of the soul is shown to be a postulate.\r\n_Holiness_, \"the perfect accordance of the will with the moral law,\"\r\ndemands an _endless progress_; and \"this endless progress is only\r\npossible on the supposition of an _endless_ duration of the _existence_\r\nand _personality_ of the same rational being (which is called the\r\nimmortality of the soul).\" Not demonstrable as a theoretical\r\nproposition, the immortality of the soul \"is an inseparable result of an\r\nunconditional a priori practical law.\" The moral interest, which is so\r\ndecisive on this question in the case of Kant, dominates Bishop Butler\r\nalso. A future life for him is important, because our happiness in it\r\nmay depend on our present conduct; and therefore our action here should\r\ntake into account the reward or punishment that it may bring on us\r\nhereafter. As he maintains that probability may and ought to be our\r\nguide in life, he is content with proving in the first chapter of the\r\n_Analogy_ that \"a future life is probable from similar changes (as\r\ndeath) already undergone in ourselves and in others, and from our\r\npresent powers, which are likely to _continue_ unless death destroy\r\nthem.\" While we may fear this, \"there is no proof that it will, either\r\nfrom the nature of death,\" of the effect of which on our powers we are\r\naltogether ignorant, \"or from the analogy of nature, which shows only\r\nthat the _sensible proof_ of our powers (not the powers themselves) may\r\nbe destroyed.\" The imagination that death will destroy these powers is\r\nunfounded, because (1) \"this supposes we are compounded, and so\r\ndiscerptible, but the contrary is probable\" on _metaphysical_ grounds\r\n(the indivisibility of the subject in which consciousness as indivisible\r\ninheres, and its distinction from the body) and also _experimental_ (the\r\npersistence of the living being in spite of changes in the body or even\r\nlosses of parts of the body); (2) this also assumes that \"our present\r\nliving powers of reflection\" must be affected in the same way by death\r\n\"as those of sensation,\" but this is disproved by their relative\r\nindependence even in this life; (3) \"even the suspension of our present\r\npowers of reflection\" is not involved in \"the idea of death, which is\r\nsimply dissolution of the body,\" and which may even \"be like birth, a\r\ncontinuation and perfecting of our powers.\" \"Even if suspension were\r\ninvolved, we cannot infer destruction from it\" (analysis of chapter i.\r\nin Angus's edition). He recognizes that \"reason did, as it well might,\r\nconclude that it should finally, and upon the whole, be well with the\r\nrighteous and ill with the wicked,\" but only \"revelation teaches us that\r\nthe next state of things after the present is appointed for the\r\nexecution of this justice\" (ch. ii. note 10). He does not use this\r\ngeneral anticipation of future judgment, as he might have done, as a\r\npositive argument for immortality.\r\n\r\nAdam Ferguson (_Institutes of Moral Philosophy_, p. 119, new ed., 1800)\r\nargues that \"the desire for immortality is an instinct, and can\r\nreasonably be regarded as an indication of that which the author of this\r\ndesire wills to do.\" From the standpoint of modern science John Fiske\r\nconfirms the validity of such an argument; for what he affirms in regard\r\nto belief in the divine is equally applicable to this belief in a future\r\nlife. \"If the relation thus established in the morning twilight of man's\r\nexistence between the human soul and a world invisible and immaterial is\r\na relation of which only the subjective term is real and the objective\r\nterm is non-existent; then I say it is something utterly without\r\nprecedent in the whole history of creation\" (_Through Nature to God_,\r\n1899, p. 188, 189). Whatever may have been Hegel's own belief in regard\r\nto personal immortality, the logical issue of his absolute idealism has\r\nbeen well stated by W. Windelband (_History of Philosophy_, p. 633). \"It\r\nbecame clear that in the system of perpetual Becoming and of the\r\ndialectical passing over of all forms into one another, the finite\r\npersonality could scarcely raise a plausible claim to the character of a\r\nsubstance and to immortality in the religious sense.\" F. D.\r\nSchleiermacher applies the phrase \"the immortality of religion\" to the\r\nreligious emotion of oneness, amid finitude, with the infinite and, amid\r\ntime, with the eternal; denies any necessary connexion between the\r\nbelief in the continuance of personal existence and the consciousness of\r\nGod; and rests his faith on immortality altogether on Christ's promise\r\nof living fellowship with His followers, as presupposing their as well\r\nas His personal immortality. A. Schopenhauer assigns immortality to the\r\nuniversal will to live; and Feuerbach declares spirit, consciousness\r\neternal, but not any individual subject. R. H. Lotze for the decision of\r\nthe question lays down the broad principle, \"All that has once come to\r\nbe will eternally continue so soon as for the organic unity of the world\r\nit has an unchangeable value, but it will obviously again cease to be,\r\nwhen that is not the case\" (_Gr. der Psy._ p. 74).\r\n\r\nObjections to the belief in immortality have been advanced from the\r\nstandpoints of materialism, naturalism, pessimism and pantheism.\r\n_Materialism_ argues that, as life depends on a material organism,\r\nthought is a function of the brain, and the soul is but the sum of\r\nmental states, to which, according to the theory of psychophysical\r\nparallelism, physical changes always correspond; therefore, the\r\ndissolution of the body carries with it necessarily the cessation of\r\nconsciousness. That, as now constituted, mind does depend on brain, life\r\non body, must be conceded, but that this dependence is so absolute that\r\nthe function must cease with the organ has not been scientifically\r\ndemonstrated; the connexion of the soul with the body is as yet too\r\nobscure to justify any such dogmatism. But against this inference the\r\nfollowing considerations may be advanced: (1) Man does distinguish\r\nhimself from his body; (2) he is conscious of his personal identity,\r\nthrough all the changes of his body; (3) in the exercise of his will he\r\nknows himself not controlled by but controlling his body; (4) his\r\nconsciousness warrants his denying the absolute identification of\r\nhimself and his body. It may further be added that materialism can be\r\nshown to be an inadequate philosophy in its attempts to account even for\r\nthe physical universe, for this is inexplicable without the assumption\r\nof mind distinct from, and directive of, matter. The theory of\r\npsychophysical parallelism has been subjected to a rigorous examination\r\nin James Ward's _Naturalism and Agnosticism_, part iii., in which the\r\nargument that mind cannot be derived from matter is convincingly\r\npresented. Sir Oliver Lodge in his reply to E. Haeckel's _Riddle of the\r\nUniverse_ maintains that \"life may be something not only\r\nultra-terrestrial, but even immaterial, something outside our present\r\ncategories of matter and energy; as real as they are, but different, and\r\nutilizing them for its own purpose\" (_Life and Matter_, 1906, p. 198).\r\nHe rejects the attempt to explain human personality as \"generated by\r\nthe material molecular aggregate of its own unaided latent power,\" and\r\naffirms that the \"universe where the human spirit is more at home than\r\nit is among these temporary collocations of matter\" is \"a universe\r\ncapable of infinite development, of noble contemplation, and of lofty\r\njoy, long after this planet--nay the whole solar system--shall have\r\nfulfilled its present spire of destiny, and retired cold and lifeless\r\nupon its endless way\" (pp. 199-200).\r\n\r\nIn his lecture on _Human Immortality_ (3rd ed., 1906), Professor William\r\nJames deals with \"two supposed objections to the doctrine.\" The first is\r\n\"the law that thought is a function of the brain.\" Accepting the law he\r\ndistinguishes _productive_ from _permissive_ or _transmissive_ function\r\n(p. 32), and, rejecting the view that brain produces thought, he\r\nrecognizes that in our present condition brain transmits thought,\r\nthought needs brain for its organ of expression; but this does not\r\nexclude the possibility of a condition in which thought will be no\r\nlonger so dependent on brain. He quotes (p. 57) with approval Kant's\r\nwords, \"The death of the body may indeed be the end of the sensational\r\nuse of our mind, but only the beginning of the intellectual use. The\r\nbody would thus be not the cause of our thinking, but merely a condition\r\nrestrictive thereof, and, although essential to our sensuous and animal\r\nconsciousness, it may be regarded as an impeder of our pure spiritual\r\nlife\" (_Kritik der reinen Vernunft_, 2nd ed., p. 809).\r\n\r\nFurther arguments in the same direction are derived from the modern\r\nschool of psychical research (see especially F. W. H. Myers' _Human\r\nPersonality_, 1903).\r\n\r\nAnother objection is advanced from the standpoint of _naturalism_,\r\nwhich, whether it issues in materialism or not, seeks to explain man as\r\nbut a product of the process of nature. The universe is so immeasurably\r\nvast in extension and duration, and man is so small, his home but a\r\nspeck in space, and his history a span in time that it seems an arrogant\r\nassumption for him to claim exemption from the universal law of\r\nevolution and dissolution. This view ignores that man has ideals of\r\nabsolute value, truth, beauty, goodness, that he consciously communes\r\nwith the God who is in all, and through all, and over all, that it is\r\nhis mind which recognizes the vastness of the universe and thinks its\r\nuniversal law, and that the mind which perceives and conceives cannot be\r\nless, but must be greater than the object of its knowledge and thought.\r\n\r\n_Pessimism_ suggests a third objection. The present life is so little\r\nworth living that its continuance is not to be desired. James Thomson\r\n(\"B.V.\") speaks \"of the restful rapture of the inviolate grave,\" and\r\nsings the praises of _death_ and of _oblivion_. We cannot admit that the\r\nhistory of mankind justifies his conclusion; for the great majority of\r\nmen life is a good, and its continuance an object of hope.\r\n\r\nFor pantheism personal immortality appears a lesser good than\r\nreabsorption in the universal life; but against this objection we may\r\nconfidently maintain that worthier of God and more blessed for man is\r\nthe hope of a conscious communion in an eternal life of the Father of\r\nall with His whole family.\r\n\r\nLastly positivism teaches a corporate instead of an individual\r\nimmortality; man should desire to live on as a beneficent influence in\r\nthe race. This conception is expressed in George Eliot's lines:\r\n\r\n  \"O, may I join the choir invisible\r\n   Of those immortal dead who live again\r\n   In minds made better by their presence: live\r\n   In pulses stirred to generosity,\r\n   In deeds of daring rectitude, in scorn\r\n   For miserable aims that end with self,\r\n   In thoughts sublime that pierce the night like stars,\r\n   And with their mild persistence urge man's search\r\n   To vaster issues.\"\r\n\r\nBut these possibilities are not mutually exclusive alternatives. A man\r\nmay live on in the world by his teaching and example as a power for\r\ngood, a factor of human progress, and he may also be continuing and\r\ncompleting his course under conditions still more favourable to all most\r\nworthy in him. Consciously to participate as a person in the progress of\r\nthe race is surely a worthier hope than unconsciously to contribute to\r\nit as an influence; ultimately to share the triumph as well as the\r\nstruggle is a more inspiring anticipation.\r\n\r\nIn stating constructively the doctrine of immortality we must assign\r\naltogether secondary importance to the metaphysical arguments from the\r\nnature of the soul. It is sufficient to show, as has already been done,\r\nthat the soul is not so absolutely dependent on the body, that the\r\ndissolution of the one must necessarily involve the cessation of the\r\nother. Such arguments as the indivisibility of the soul and its\r\npersistence can at most indicate the _possibility_ of immortality.\r\n\r\nThe _juridical argument_ has some force; the present life does not show\r\nthat harmony of condition and character which our sense of justice leads\r\nus to expect; the wicked prosper and the righteous suffer; there is\r\nground for the expectation that in the future life the anomalies of this\r\nlife will be corrected. Although this argument has the support of such\r\ngreat names as Butler and Kant, yet it will repel many minds as an\r\nappeal to the motive of self-interest.\r\n\r\nThe _ethical argument_ has greater value. Man's life here is incomplete,\r\nand the more lofty his aims, the more worthy his labours, the more\r\nincomplete will it appear to be. The man who lives for fame, wealth,\r\npower, may be satisfied in this life; but he who lives for the ideals of\r\ntruth, beauty, goodness, lives not for time but for eternity, for his\r\nideals cannot be realized, and so his life fulfilled on this side of the\r\ngrave. Unless these ideals are mocking visions, man has a right to\r\nexpect the continuance of his life for its completion. This is the line\r\nof argument developed by Professor Hugo Münsterberg in his lecture on\r\n_The Eternal Life_ (1905), although he states it in the terms peculiar\r\nto his psychology, in which personality is conceived as primarily will.\r\n\"No endless duration is our goal, but complete repose in the perfect\r\nsatisfaction which the will finds when it has reached the significance,\r\nthe influence, and the value at which it is aiming\" (p. 83).\r\n\r\nMore general in its appeal still is the argument from the _affections_,\r\nwhich has been beautifully developed in Tennyson's _In Memoriam_. The\r\nheart protests against the severance of death, and claims the\r\ncontinuance of love's communion after death; and as man feels that love\r\nis what is most godlike in his nature, love's claim has supreme\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nThere is a _religious argument_ for immortality. The saints of the\r\nHebrew nation were sure that as God had entered into fellowship with\r\nthem, death could not sever them from his presence. This is the argument\r\nin Psalms xvi. and xvii., if, as is probable, the closing verses do\r\nexpress the hope of a glorious and blessed immortality. This too is the\r\nproof Jesus himself offers when he declares God to be the God of the\r\nliving and not of the dead (Matt. xxii. 32). God's companions cannot\r\nbecome death's victims.\r\n\r\nJosiah Royce in his lecture on _The Conception of Immortality_ (1900)\r\ncombines this argument of the soul's union with God with the argument of\r\nthe incompleteness of man's life here:--\r\n\r\n  \"Just because God is One, all our lives have various and unique places\r\n  in the harmony of the divine life. And just because God attains and\r\n  wins and finds this uniqueness, all our lives win in our union with\r\n  Him the individuality which is essential to their true meaning. And\r\n  just because individuals whose lives have uniqueness of meaning are\r\n  here only objects of pursuit, the attainment of this very\r\n  individuality, since it is indeed real, occurs not in our present form\r\n  of consciousness, but in a life that now we see not, yet in a life\r\n  whose genuine meaning is continuous with our own human life, however\r\n  far from our present flickering form of disappointed human\r\n  consciousness that life of the final individuality may be. Of this our\r\n  true individual life, our present life is a glimpse, a fragment, a\r\n  hint, and in its best moments a visible beginning. That this\r\n  individual life of all of us is not something limited in its temporal\r\n  expression to the life that now we experience, follows from the very\r\n  fact that here nothing final or individual is found expressed\" (pp.\r\n  144-146).\r\n\r\nR. W. Emerson declares that \"the impulse to seek proof of immortality is\r\nitself the strongest proof of all.\" We expect immortality not merely\r\nbecause we desire it; but because the desire itself arises from all that\r\nis best and truest and worthiest in ourselves. The desire is reasonable,\r\nmoral, social, religious; it has the same worth as the loftiest ideals,\r\nand worthiest aspirations of the soul of man. The loss of the belief\r\ncasts a dark shadow over the present life. \"No sooner do we try to get\r\nrid of the idea of Immortality--than Pessimism raises its head.... Human\r\ngriefs seem little worth assuaging; human happiness too paltry (at the\r\nbest) to be worth increasing. The whole moral world is reduced to a\r\npoint. Good and evil, right and wrong, become infinitesimal, ephemeral\r\nmatters. The affections die away--die of their own conscious feebleness\r\nand uselessness. A moral paralysis creeps over us\" (_Natural Religion_,\r\nPostscript). The belief exercises a potent moral influence. \"The day,\"\r\nsays Ernest Renan, \"in which the belief in an after-life shall vanish\r\nfrom the earth will witness a terrific moral and spiritual decadence.\r\nSome of us perhaps might do without it, provided only that others held\r\nit fast. But there is no lever capable of raising an entire people if\r\nonce they have lost their faith in the immortality of the soul\" (quoted\r\nby A. W. Momerie, _Immortality_, p. 9). To this belief, many and good as\r\nare the arguments which can be advanced for it, a confident certainty is\r\ngiven by Christian faith in the Risen Lord, and the life and immortality\r\nwhich he has brought to light in his Gospel.\r\n\r\n  In addition to the works referred to above, see R. K. Gaye, _The\r\n  Platonic Conception of Immortality and its Connexion with the Theory\r\n  of Ideas_ (1904); R. H. Charles, _A Critical History of the Doctrine\r\n  of a Future Life in Israel, in Judaism and in Christianity_ (1899); E.\r\n  Pétavel, _The Problem of Immortality_ (Eng. trans. by F. A. Freer,\r\n  1892); J. Fiske, _The Destiny of Man, viewed in the Light of his\r\n  Origin_ (1884); G. A. Gordon, _Immortality and the New Theodicy_\r\n  (1897); Henry Buckle, _The After Life_ (1907).     (A. E. G.*)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMMUNITY (from Lat. _immunis_, not subject to a _munus_ or public\r\nservice), a general term for exemption from liability, principally used\r\nin the legal sense discussed below, but also in recent times in\r\npathology (for which see BACTERIOLOGY). In international law the term\r\n(\"not serving,\" \"not subject\") implies exemption from the jurisdiction\r\nof the state which otherwise exercises jurisdiction where the immunity\r\narises. It is thus applied to the exceptional position granted to\r\nsovereigns and chiefs of states generally, and their direct\r\nrepresentatives in the states to which they are accredited.\r\n\r\nUnder EXTERRITORIALITY is treated the inviolability of embassies and\r\nlegations and the application of the material side of the doctrine of\r\nimmunity. As a right appertaining to the persons of those who enjoy it,\r\nthe doctrine has grown out of the necessity for sovereigns of respecting\r\neach other's persons in their common interest. To be able to negotiate\r\nwithout danger of arrest or interference of any kind with their persons\r\nwas the only condition upon which sovereigns would have been able to\r\nmeet and discuss their joint interests. With the development of states\r\nas independent entities and of intercourse between them and their\r\n\"nationals,\" the work of diplomatic missions increased to such an extent\r\nthat instead of having merely occasional ambassadors as at the\r\nbeginning, states found it expedient to have resident representatives\r\nwith a permanent residence. Hence the sovereign's inviolability becomes\r\nvested in the person of the sovereign's delegate, and with it as a\r\nnecessary corollary the exterritoriality of his residence. Out of the\r\nfurther expansion of the work of diplomatic missions came duplication of\r\nthe _personnel_ and classes of diplomatic secretaries, who as forming\r\npart of the embassy or legation also had to be covered by the diplomatic\r\nimmunity.\r\n\r\nIn no branch of international intercourse have states shown so laudable\r\na respect for tradition as in the case of this immunity, and this in\r\nspite of the hardship which frequently arises for private citizens\r\nthrough unavoidable dealings with members of embassies and legations.\r\nThe Institute of International Law (see PEACE) at their Cambridge\r\nsession in 1895 drew up the following rules,[1] which may be taken to be\r\nthe only precise statement of theory on the subject, for the guidance of\r\nforeign offices in dealing with it:--\r\n\r\n  ART. 1.--Public ministers are inviolable. They also enjoy\r\n  \"exterritoriality,\" in the sense and to the extent hereinafter\r\n  mentioned and a certain number of immunities.\r\n\r\n  ART. 2.--The privilege of inviolability extends: (1) To all classes\r\n  of public ministers who regularly represent their sovereign or their\r\n  country; (2) To all persons forming part of the official staff of a\r\n  diplomatic mission; (3) To all persons forming part of its\r\n  non-official staff, under reserve, that if they belong to the country\r\n  where the mission resides they only enjoy it within the official\r\n  residence.\r\n\r\n  ART. 3.--The government to which the minister is accredited must\r\n  abstain from all offence, insult or violence against the persons\r\n  entitled to the privilege, must set an example in the respect which is\r\n  due to them and protect them by specially rigorous penalties from all\r\n  offence, insult or violence on the part of the inhabitants of the\r\n  country, so that they may devote themselves to their duties in perfect\r\n  freedom.\r\n\r\n  ART. 4.--Immunity applies to everything necessary for the fulfilment\r\n  by ministers of their duties, especially to personal effects, papers,\r\n  archives and correspondence.\r\n\r\n  ART. 5.--It lasts during the whole time which the minister or\r\n  diplomatic official spends, in his official capacity, in the country\r\n  to which he has been sent.\r\n\r\n  It continues even in time of war between the two powers during the\r\n  period necessary to enable the minister to leave the country with his\r\n  staff and effects.\r\n\r\n  ART. 6.--Inviolability cannot be claimed: (1) In case of legitimate\r\n  defence on the part of private persons against acts committed by the\r\n  persons who enjoy the privilege; (2) In case of risks incurred by any\r\n  of the persons in question voluntarily or needlessly; (3) In case of\r\n  improper acts committed by them, provoking on the part of the state to\r\n  which the minister is accredited measures of defence or precaution;\r\n  but, except in a case of extreme urgency, this state should confine\r\n  itself to reporting the facts to the minister's government, requesting\r\n  the punishment or the recall of the guilty agent and, if necessary, to\r\n  surrounding the official residence to prevent unlawful communications\r\n  or manifestations.\r\n\r\n  _Immunity with Respect to Taxes._\r\n\r\n  ART. 11.--A public minister in a foreign country, functionaries\r\n  officially attached to his mission and the members of their families\r\n  residing with them, are exempt from paying: (1) Personal direct taxes\r\n  and sumptuary taxes; (2) General taxes on property, whether on capital\r\n  or income; (3) War contributions; (4) Customs duties in respect of\r\n  articles for their personal use.\r\n\r\n  Each government shall indicate the grounds (_justifications_) to which\r\n  these exemptions from taxation shall be subordinated.\r\n\r\n  _Immunity from Jurisdiction._\r\n\r\n  ART. 12.--A public minister in a foreign country, functionaries\r\n  officially attached to his mission and the members of their families\r\n  residing with them, are exempt from all jurisdiction, civil or\r\n  criminal, of the state to which they are accredited; in principle,\r\n  they are only subject to the civil and criminal jurisdiction of their\r\n  own country. A claimant may apply to the courts of the capital of the\r\n  country of the minister, subject to the right of the minister to prove\r\n  that he has a different domicile in his country.\r\n\r\n  ART. 13.--With respect to crimes, persons indicated in the preceding\r\n  article remain subject to the penal laws of their own country, as if\r\n  they had committed the acts in their own country.\r\n\r\n  ART. 14.--The immunity attaches to the function in respect of acts\r\n  connected with the function. As regards acts done not in connexion\r\n  with the function, immunity can only be claimed so long as the\r\n  function lasts.\r\n\r\n  ART. 15.--Persons of the nationality of the country to the government\r\n  of which they are accredited cannot claim the privilege of immunity.\r\n\r\n  ART. 16.--Immunity from jurisdiction cannot be invoked: (1) In case of\r\n  proceedings taken by reason of engagements entered into by the exempt\r\n  person, not in his official or private capacity, but in the exercise\r\n  of a profession carried on by him in the country concurrently with his\r\n  diplomatic functions; (2) In respect of real actions, including\r\n  possessory actions, relating to anything movable or immovable in the\r\n  country.\r\n\r\n  It exists even in case of a breach of the law which may endanger\r\n  public order or safety, or of crime against the safety of the state,\r\n  without prejudice to such steps as the territorial government may take\r\n  for its own protection.\r\n\r\n  ART. 17.--Persons entitled to immunity from jurisdiction may refuse to\r\n  appear as witnesses before a territorial court on condition that, if\r\n  required by diplomatic intervention, they shall give their testimony\r\n  in the official residence to a magistrate of the country appointed for\r\n  the purpose.\r\n\r\nFurther questions connected with Immunity and Exterritoriality (q.v.)\r\narise out of the different industrial enterprises undertaken by states,\r\nsuch as posts, telegraphs, telephones, railways, steamships, &c., which\r\nrequire regulation to prevent conflicts of interest between the state\r\nowners and the private interests involved in these enterprises.\r\n     (T.

S.E. by rail,\r\n140 ft. above sea-level. Pop. (1901) 12,058 (town); 33,144 (commune).\r\nThe cathedral of S. Cassiano has been modernized; it possesses\r\ninteresting reliquaries, and contains the tomb of Petrus Chrysologus,\r\narchbishop of Ravenna (d. 451), a native of Imola. S. Domenico has a\r\nfine Gothic portal and S. Maria in Regola an old campanile. The town\r\nalso contains some fine palaces. The communal library has some MSS.,\r\nincluding a psalter with miniatures, that once belonged to Sir Thomas\r\nMore. The citadel is square with round towers at the angles; it dates\r\nfrom 1304, and is now used as a prison. Imola has a large lunatic asylum\r\nwith over 1200 inmates. Innocenzo Francucci (Innocenzo da Imola), a\r\npainter of the Bolognese school (1494-1549), was a native of Imola, and\r\ntwo of his works are preserved in the Palazzo del Comune. The Madonna\r\ndel Piratello, 2 m. outside the town to the N.W., is in the early\r\nRenaissance style (1488); the campanile was probably built from\r\nBramante's plans in 1506.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Forum Cornelii, a station on the Via Aemilia, is said by\r\nPrudentius, writing in the 5th century A.D., to have been founded by\r\nSulla; but the fact that it belonged to the _Tribus Pollia_ shows that\r\nit already possessed Roman citizenship before the Social war. In later\r\ntimes we hear little of it; Martial published his third book of epigrams\r\nwhile he was there. In the Lombard period the name Imolas begins to\r\nappear. In 1480, after a chequered history, the town came into the\r\npossession of Girolamo Riario, lord of Forli, as the dowry of his wife\r\nCaterina Sforza, and was incorporated with the States of the Church by\r\nCaesar Borgia in 1500.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMP (O. Eng. _impa_, a graft, shoot; the verb _impian_ is cognate with\r\nGer. _impfen_, to graft, inoculate, and the Fr. _enter_; the ultimate\r\norigin is probably the Gr. [Greek: emphyein], to implant, cf. [Greek:\r\nemphytos], engrafted), originally a slip or shoot of a plant or tree\r\nused for grafting. This use is seen in Chaucer (_Prologue to the Monk's\r\nTale_, 68) \"Of fieble trees ther comen wrecched ympes.\" The verb \"to\r\nimp\" in the sense of \"to graft\" was especially used of the grafting of\r\nfeathers on to the wing of a falcon or hawk to replace broken or damaged\r\nplumage, and is frequently used metaphorically. Like \"scion,\" \"imp\" was\r\ntill the 17th century used of a member of a family, especially of high\r\nrank, hence often used as equivalent to \"child.\" The _New English\r\nDictionary_ quotes an epitaph (1584) in the Beauchamp chapel at Warwick,\r\n\"Heere resteth the body of the noble Impe Robert of Dudley ... sonne of\r\nRobert Erle of Leycester.\" The current use of the word for a small devil\r\nor mischievous sprite is due to the expressions \"imp of Satan, or of the\r\ndevil or of hell,\" in the sense of \"child of evil.\" It was thus\r\nparticularly applied to the demons supposed to be the \"familiar\" spirits\r\nof witches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPATIENS, in botany, a genus of annual or biennial herbs, sometimes\r\nbecoming shrubby, chiefly natives of the mountains of tropical Asia and\r\nAfrica, but also found widely distributed in the north temperate zone\r\nand in South Africa. The flowers, which are purple, yellow, pink or\r\nwhite and often showy, are spurred and irregular in form and borne in\r\nthe leaf-axils. The name is derived from the fact that the seed-pod when\r\nripe discharges the seeds by the elastic separation and coiling of the\r\nvalves. _Impatiens Noli-me-tangere,_ touch-me-not, an annual succulent\r\nherb with yellow flowers, is probably wild in moist mountainous\r\ndistricts in north Wales, Lancashire and Westmorland. _I. Roylei,_ a\r\ntall hardy succulent annual with rose-purple flowers, a Himalayan\r\nspecies, is common in England as a self-sown garden plant or garden\r\nescape. _I. Balsamina,_ the common balsam of gardens, a well-known\r\nannual, is a native of India; it is one of the showiest of summer and\r\nautumn flowers and of comparatively easy cultivation. _I. Sultani,_ a\r\nhandsome plant, with scarlet flowers, a native of Zanzibar, is easily\r\ngrown in a greenhouse throughout the summer, but requires warmth in\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPEACHMENT (O. Fr. _empechement, empeschement,_ from _empecher_ or\r\n_empescher,_ to hinder, Late Lat. _impedicare,_ to entangle, _pedica,_\r\nfetter, _pes_, foot), the English form of judicial parliamentary\r\nprocedure against criminals, in which the House of Commons are the\r\nprosecutors and the House of Lords the judges. It differs from bills of\r\nattainder (q.v.) in being strictly judicial. When the House of Commons\r\nhas accepted a motion for impeachment, the mover is ordered to proceed\r\nto the bar of the House of Lords, and there impeach the accused \"in the\r\nname of the House of Commons, and of all the Commons of the United\r\nKingdom.\" The charges are formulated in articles, to each of which the\r\naccused may deliver a written answer. The prosecution must confine\r\nitself to the charges contained in the articles, though further articles\r\nmay be adhibited from time to time. The Commons appoint managers to\r\nconduct the prosecution, but the whole House in committee attends the\r\ntrial. The defendant may appear by counsel. The president of the House\r\nof Lords is the lord high steward, in the case of peers impeached for\r\nhigh treason; in other cases the lord chancellor. The hearing takes\r\nplace as in an ordinary trial, the defence being allowed to call\r\nwitnesses if necessary, and the prosecution having a right of reply. At\r\nthe end of the case the president \"puts to each peer, beginning with the\r\njunior baron, the questions upon the first article, whether the accused\r\nbe guilty of the crimes charged therein. Each peer in succession rises\r\nin his place when the question is put, and standing uncovered, and\r\nlaying his right hand upon his breast, answers, 'Guilty' or 'Not\r\nguilty,' as the case may be, 'upon my honour.' Each article is proceeded\r\nwith separately in the same manner, the lord high steward giving his own\r\nopinion the last\" (May's _Parliamentary Practice,_ c. xxiii.). Should\r\nthe accused be found guilty, judgment follows if the Commons move for\r\nit, but not otherwise. The Commons thus retain the power of pardon in\r\ntheir own hands, and this right they have in several cases expressly\r\nclaimed by resolution, declaring that it is not parliamentary for their\r\nlordships to give judgment \"until the same be first demanded by this\r\nHouse.\" Spiritual peers occupy an anomalous position in the trial of\r\npeers, as not being themselves ennobled in blood; on the impeachment of\r\nDanby it was declared by the Lords that Spiritual peers have the right\r\nto stay and sit during proceedings for impeachment, but it is customary\r\nfor them to withdraw before judgment is given, entering a protest\r\n\"saving to themselves and their successors all such rights in judicature\r\nas they have by law, and by right ought to have.\" An impeachment, unlike\r\nother parliamentary proceedings, is not interrupted by prorogation, nor\r\neven by dissolution. Proceedings in the House of Commons preliminary to\r\nan impeachment are subject to the ordinary rules, and in the Warren\r\nHastings case an act was passed to prevent the preliminary proceedings\r\nfrom discontinuance by prorogation and dissolution. A royal pardon\r\ncannot be pleaded in bar of an impeachment, though it is within the\r\nroyal prerogative to pardon after the lords have pronounced judgment.\r\nThe point was raised in the case of the earl of Danby in 1679, and the\r\nrule was finally settled by the Act of Settlement. Persons found guilty\r\non impeachment may be reprieved or pardoned like other convicts.\r\nImpeachment will lie against all kinds of crimes and misdemeanours, and\r\nagainst offenders of all ranks. In the case of Simon de Beresford, tried\r\nbefore the House of Lords in 1330, the House declared \"that the judgment\r\nbe not drawn into example or consequence in time to come, whereby the\r\nsaid peers may be charged hereafter to judge others than their peers,\"\r\nfrom which Blackstone and others have inferred that \"a commoner cannot\r\nbe impeached before the Lords for any capital offence, but only for high\r\nmisdemeanours.\" In the case of Edward Fitzharris in 1681, the House of\r\nCommons in answer to a resolution of the Lords suspending the\r\nimpeachment, declared it to be their undoubted right \"to impeach any\r\npeer or commoner for treason or any other crime or misdemeanour.\" And\r\nthe House of Lords has in practice recognized the right of the Commons\r\nto impeach whomsoever they will. The procedure has, however, been\r\nreserved for great political offenders whom the ordinary powers of the\r\nlaw might fail to reach. It has now fallen into desuetude. The last\r\nimpeachments were those of Warren Hastings (1788-1795) and Lord Melville\r\n(1806), but an unsuccessful attempt was made by Thomas C. Anstey to\r\nimpeach Lord Palmerston in 1848. The earliest recorded instances of\r\nimpeachment are those of Lord Latimer in 1376 and of Pole, earl of\r\nSuffolk, in 1386. From the time of Edward IV. to Elizabeth it fell into\r\ndisuse, \"partly,\" says Hallam, \"from the loss of that control which the\r\nCommons had obtained under Richard II. and the Lancastrian kings, and\r\npartly from the preference the Tudor princes had given to bills of\r\nattainder or pains and penalties when they wished to turn the arm of\r\nparliament against an obnoxious subject.\" Revived in the reign of James\r\nI., it became an instrument of parliamentary resistance to the crown,\r\nand it was not unfrequently resorted to in the first three reigns after\r\nthe Revolution.\r\n\r\nIn the United States the procedure of impeachment both in the national\r\nand in almost all of the state governments is very similar to that\r\ndescribed above. The national constitution prescribes that the House of\r\nRepresentatives \"shall have the sole power of impeachment\" and that \"the\r\nSenate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments.\" The House\r\nappoints managers to conduct the prosecution at the bar of the Senate,\r\nand the vote of the Senate is taken by putting the question separately\r\nto each member, who, during the trial, must be on oath or affirmation.\r\nIn ordinary cases the president or president _pro tempore_ of the Senate\r\npresides, but when the president of the United States is on trial the\r\npresiding officer must be the chief justice of the United States Supreme\r\nCourt. A two-thirds vote is necessary for conviction. The president,\r\nvice-president or any civil officer of the United States may be\r\nimpeached for \"treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanours,\"\r\nand if convicted, is removed from office and may be disqualified for\r\nholding any office under the government in future. The officer after\r\nremoval is also \"liable and subject to indictment, trial, judgment and\r\npunishment, according to law.\" The term \"civil officers of the United\r\nStates\" has been construed as being inapplicable to members of the\r\nSenate and the House of Representatives. The president's pardoning power\r\ndoes not extend to officers convicted, on impeachment, of offences\r\nagainst the United States. Since the organization of the Federal\r\ngovernment there have been only eight impeachment trials before the\r\nUnited States Senate, and of these only two--the trials of Judge John\r\nPickering, a Federal District judge for the District of New Hampshire,\r\nin 1803, on a charge of making decisions contrary to law and of\r\ndrunkenness and profanity on the bench, and of Judge W. H. Humphreys,\r\nJudge of the Federal District Court of Tennessee, in 1863, on a charge\r\nof making a secession speech and of accepting a judicial position under\r\nthe Confederate Government--resulted in convictions. The two most famous\r\ncases are those of Justice Samuel Chase of the United States Supreme\r\nCourt in 1805, and of President Andrew Johnson, the only chief of the\r\nexecutive who has been impeached, in 1868. There is a conflict of\r\nopinion with regard to the power of the House to impeach a Federal\r\nofficer who has resigned his office, and also with regard to the kind of\r\noffences for which an officer can be impeached, some authorities\r\nmaintaining that only indictable offences warrant impeachment, and\r\nothers that impeachment is warranted by any act highly prejudicial to\r\nthe public welfare or subversive of any essential principle of\r\ngovernment. The latter view was adopted by the House of Representatives\r\nwhen it impeached President Johnson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPERIAL CHAMBER (_Reichskammergericht_), the supreme judicial court of\r\nthe Holy Roman Empire, during the period between 1495 and the\r\ndissolution of the Empire in 1806. From the early middle ages there had\r\nbeen a supreme court of justice for the Empire--the _Hofgericht_ (or\r\n_curia imperatoris_, as it were), in which the emperor himself presided.\r\nBy his side sat a body of assessors (_Urtheilsfinder_), who must be at\r\nleast seven in number, and who might, in solemn cases, be far more\r\nnumerous,[1] the assessors who acted varying from time to time and from\r\ncase to case. The Hofgericht was connected with the person of the\r\nemperor; it ceased to act when he was abroad; it died with his death.\r\nUpon him it depended for its efficiency; and when, in the 15th century,\r\nthe emperor ceased to command respect, his court lost the confidence of\r\nhis subjects. The dreary reign of Frederick III. administered its\r\ndeathblow and after 1450 it ceased to sit. Its place was taken by the\r\n_Kammergericht_, which appeared side by side with the Hofgericht from\r\n1415, and after 1450 replaced it altogether. The king (or his deputy)\r\nstill presided in the Kammergericht and it was still his personal court;\r\nbut the members of the court were now officials--the _consiliarii_ of\r\nthe imperial _aula_ (or _Kammer_, whence the name of the court). It was\r\ngenerally the legal members of the council who sat in the Kammergericht\r\n(see under AULIC COUNCIL); and as they were generally doctors of civil\r\nlaw, the court which they composed tended to act according to that law,\r\nand thus contributed to the \"Reception\" of Roman law into Germany\r\ntowards the end of the 15th century. The old Hofgericht had been filled,\r\nas it were, by amateurs (provided they knew some law, and were peers of\r\nthe person under trial), and it had acted by old customary law; the\r\nKammergericht, on the contrary, was composed of lawyers, and it acted by\r\nthe written law of Rome. Even the Kammergericht, however, fell into\r\ndisuse in the later years of the reign of Frederick III.; and the\r\ncreation of a new and efficient court became a matter of pressing\r\nnecessity, and was one of the most urgent of the reforms which were\r\nmooted in the reign of Maximilian I.\r\n\r\nThis new court was eventually created in 1495; and it bore the name of\r\n_Reichskammergericht_, or Imperial Chamber. It was distinguished from\r\nthe old Kammergericht by the essential fact that it was not the personal\r\ncourt of the emperor, but the official court of the Empire (or\r\n_Reich_--whence its name). This change was a natural result of the\r\npeculiar character of the movement of reform which was at this time\r\nattempted by the electors, under the guidance of Bertold, elector of\r\nMainz. Their aim was to substitute for the old and personal council and\r\ncourt appointed and controlled by the emperor a new and official\r\ncouncil, and a new and official court, appointed and controlled by the\r\ndiet (or rather, in the ultimate resort, by the electors). The members\r\nof the Imperial Chamber, which was created by the diet in 1495 in order\r\nto serve as such a court,[2] were therefore the agents of the Empire,\r\nand not of the emperor. The emperor appointed the president; the Empire\r\nnominated the assessors, or judges.[3] There were originally sixteen\r\nassessors (afterwards, as a rule, eighteen): half of these were to be\r\ndoctors of Roman law, while half were to be knights; but after 1555 it\r\nbecame necessary that the latter should be learned in Roman law, even if\r\nthey had not actually taken their doctorate.\r\n\r\nThus the Empire at last was possessed of a court, a court resting on the\r\nenactment of the diet, and not on the emperor's will; a court paid by\r\nthe Empire, and not by the emperor; a court resident in a fixed place\r\n(until 1693, Spires, and afterwards, from 1693 to 1806, Wetzlar), and\r\nnot attached to the emperor's person. The original intention of the\r\ncourt was that it should repress private war (_Fehde_), and maintain the\r\npublic peace (_Landfriede_). The great result which in the issue it\r\nserved to achieve was the final \"Reception\" of Roman law as the common\r\nlaw of Germany. That the Imperial Chamber should itself administer Roman\r\nlaw was an inevitable result of its composition; and it was equally\r\ninevitable that the composition and procedure of the supreme imperial\r\ncourt should be imitated in the various states which composed the\r\nEmpire, and that Roman law should thus become the local, as it was\r\nalready the central, law of the land.\r\n\r\nThe province of the Imperial Chamber, as it came to be gradually defined\r\nby statute and use, extended to breaches of the public peace, cases of\r\narbitrary distraint or imprisonment, pleas which concerned the treasury,\r\nviolations of the emperor's decrees or the laws passed by the diet,\r\ndisputes about property between immediate tenants of the Empire or the\r\nsubjects of different rulers, and finally suits against immediate\r\ntenants of the Empire (with the exception of criminal charges and\r\nmatters relating to imperial fiefs, which went to the Aulic Council). It\r\nhad also cognizance in cases of refusal to do justice; and it acted as\r\na court of appeal from territorial courts in civil and, to a small\r\nextent, in criminal cases, though it lost its competence as a court of\r\nappeal in all territories which enjoyed a _privilegium de non\r\nappellando_ (such as, e.g. the territories of the electors). The\r\nbusiness of the court was, however, badly done; the delay was\r\ninterminable, thanks, in large measure, to the want of funds, which\r\nprevented the maintenance of the proper number of judges. In all its\r\nbusiness it suffered from the competition of the Aulic Council (q.v.);\r\nfor that body, having lost all executive competence after the 16th\r\ncentury, had also devoted itself exclusively to judicial work. Composed\r\nof the personal advisers of the emperor, the Aulic Council did justice\r\non his behalf (the erection of a court to do justice for the Empire\r\nhaving left the emperor still possessed of the right to do justice for\r\nhimself through his _consiliarii_); and it may thus be said to be the\r\ndescendant of the old Kammergericht. The competition between the Aulic\r\nCouncil and the Imperial Chamber was finally regulated by the treaty of\r\nWestphalia, which laid it down that the court which first dealt with a\r\ncase should alone have competence to pursue it.\r\n\r\n  See R. Schröder, _Lehrbuch der deutschen Rechtsgeschichte_ (Leipzig,\r\n  1904); J. N. Harpprecht, _Staatsarchiv des Reichskammergerichts_\r\n  (1757-1785); and G. Stobbe, _Reichshofgericht und Reichskammergericht_\r\n  (Leipzig, 1878).     (E. Br.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [1] For instance, all the members of the diet might serve as\r\n    Urtheilsfinder in a case like the condemnation of Henry the Lion,\r\n    duke of Saxony, in the 12th century.\r\n\r\n  [2] The attempt to create a new and official council ultimately\r\n    failed.\r\n\r\n  [3] More exactly, the emperor nominates, according to the regular\r\n    usage of later times, a certain number of members, partly as emperor,\r\n    and partly as the sovereign of his hereditary estates; while the\r\n    rest, who form the majority, are nominated partly by the electors and\r\n    partly by the six ancient circles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPERIAL CITIES OR TOWNS, the usual English translation of\r\n_Reichsstädte_, an expression of frequent occurrence in German history.\r\nThese were cities and towns subject to no authority except that of the\r\nemperor, or German king, in other words they were immediate; the\r\nearliest of them stood on the demesne land of their sovereign, and they\r\noften grew up around his palaces. A distinction was thus made between a\r\n_Reichsstadt_ and a _Landstadt_, the latter being dependent upon some\r\nprince, not upon the emperor direct. The term _Freie Reichsstadt_, which\r\nis sometimes used in the same sense as _Reichsstadt_, is rightly only\r\napplicable to seven cities, Basel, Strassburg, Spires, Worms, Mainz,\r\nCologne and Regensburg. Having freed themselves from the domination of\r\ntheir ecclesiastical lords these called themselves _Freistädte_ and in\r\npractice their position was indistinguishable from that of the\r\n_Reichsstädte_.\r\n\r\nIn the middle ages many other places won the coveted position of a\r\n_Reichsstadt_. Some gained it by gift and others by purchase; some won\r\nit by force of arms, others usurped it during times of anarchy, while a\r\nnumber secured it through the extinction of dominant families, like the\r\nHohenstaufen. There were many more free towns in southern than in\r\nnorthern Germany, but their number was continually fluctuating, for\r\ntheir liberties were lost much more quickly than they were gained. Mainz\r\nwas conquered and subjected to the archbishop in 1462. Some free towns\r\nfell into the hands of various princes of the Empire and others placed\r\nthemselves voluntarily under such protection. Some, like Donauwörth in\r\n1607, were deprived of their privileges by the emperor on account of\r\nreal, or supposed, offences, while others were separated from the Empire\r\nby conquest. In 1648 Besançon passed into the possession of Spain, Basel\r\nhad already thrown in its lot with the Swiss confederation, while\r\nStrassburg, Colmar, Hagenau and others were seized by Louis XIV.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the free towns had been winning valuable privileges in\r\naddition to those which they already possessed, and the wealthier among\r\nthem, like Lübeck and Augsburg, were practically _imperia in imperio_,\r\nwaging war and making peace, and ruling their people without any outside\r\ninterference. But they had also learned that union is strength. They\r\nformed alliances among themselves, both for offence and for defence, and\r\nthese _Städtebünde_ had an important influence on the course of German\r\nhistory in the 14th and 15th centuries. These leagues were frequently at\r\nwar with the ecclesiastical and secular potentates of their district and\r\nin general they were quite able to hold their own in these quarrels. The\r\nright of the free towns to be represented in the imperial diet was\r\nformally recognized in 1489, and about the same time they divided\r\nthemselves into two groups, or benches, the Rhenish and the Swabian. By\r\nthe peace of Westphalia in 1648 they were formally constituted as the\r\nthird college of the diet. A list drawn up in 1422 mentions 75 free\r\ncities, another drawn up in 1521 mentions 84, but at the time of the\r\nFrench Revolution the number had decreased to 51. At this time the\r\nRhenish free cities were: Cologne, Aix-la-Chapelle, Lübeck, Worms,\r\nSpires, Frankfort-on-the-Main, Goslar, Bremen, Hamburg, Mühlhausen,\r\nNordhausen, Dortmund, Friedberg and Wetzlar. The Swabian free cities\r\nwere: Regensburg, Augsburg, Nuremberg, Ulm, Esslingen, Reutlingen,\r\nNördlingen, Rothenburg-on-the-Tauber, Schwäbisch-Hall, Rottweil,\r\nUeberlingen, Heilbronn, Memmingen, Gmünd, Dinkelsbühl, Lindau, Biberach,\r\nRavensburg, Schweinfurt, Kempten, Windsheim, Kaufbeuern, Weil, Wangen,\r\nIsny, Pfullendorf, Offenburg, Leutkirch, Wimpfen, Weissenburg, Giengen,\r\nGengenbach, Zell, Buchorn, Aalen, Buchau and Bopfingen. But a large\r\nproportion of them had as little claim to their exceptional positions as\r\nthe pocket boroughs of Great Britain and Ireland had before the passing\r\nof the Reform Bill of 1832.\r\n\r\nBy the peace of Lunéville in 1801 Cologne, Aix-la-Chapelle, Worms and\r\nSpires were taken by France, and by the decision of the imperial\r\ndeputation of 1803 six cities only: Hamburg, Lübeck, Bremen, Augsburg,\r\nFrankfort-on-Main and Nuremberg, were allowed to keep their\r\n_Reichsfreiheit_, or in other words to hold directly of the Empire. This\r\nnumber was soon further reduced. On the dissolution of the Empire in\r\n1806 Augsburg and Nuremburg passed under the sovereignty of Bavaria, and\r\nFrankfort was made the seat of a duchy for Karl Theodor von Dalberg,\r\nelector and archbishop of Mainz, who was appointed prince primate of the\r\nConfederation of the Rhine. When the German Confederation was\r\nestablished in 1815 Hamburg, Lübeck, Bremen and Frankfort were\r\nrecognized as free cities, and the first three hold that position in the\r\nmodern German empire; but Frankfort, in consequence of the part it took\r\nin the war of 1866, lost its independence and was annexed by Prussia.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier years of their existence the free cities were under the\r\njurisdiction of an imperial officer, who was called the _Reichsvogt_ or\r\nimperial advocate, or sometimes the _Reichsschultheiss_ or imperial\r\nprocurator. As time went on many of the cities purchased the right of\r\nfilling these offices with their own nominees; and in several instances\r\nthe imperial authority fell practically into desuetude except when it\r\nwas stirred into action by peculiar circumstances. The internal\r\nconstitution of the free cities was organized after no common model,\r\nalthough several of them had a constitution drawn up in imitation of\r\nthat of Cologne, which was one of the first to assert its independence.\r\n\r\n  For the history of the free cities, see J.

H.*)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPEY, SIR ELIJAH (1732-1809), chief justice of Bengal, was born on the\r\n13th of June 1732, and educated at Westminster with Warren Hastings, who\r\nwas his intimate friend throughout life. In 1773 he was appointed the\r\nfirst chief justice of the new supreme court at Calcutta, and in 1775\r\npresided at the trial of Nuncomar (q.v.) for forgery, with which his\r\nname has been chiefly connected in history. His impeachment was\r\nunsuccessfully attempted in the House of Commons in 1787, and he is\r\naccused by Macaulay of conspiring with Hastings to commit a judicial\r\nmurder; but the whole question of the trial of Nuncomar has been\r\nexamined in detail by Sir James Fitzjames Stephen, who states that \"no\r\nman ever had, or could have, a fairer trial than Nuncomar, and Impey in\r\nparticular behaved with absolute fairness and as much indulgence as was\r\ncompatible with his duty.\"\r\n\r\n  See E. B. Impey, _Sir Elijah Impey_ (1846); and Sir James Stephen,\r\n  _The Story of Nuncomar and the Impeachment of Sir Elijah Impey_\r\n  (1885).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPHAL, the capital of the state of Manipur (q.v.) in eastern Bengal and\r\nAssam, on the north-east frontier of India, situated at the confluence\r\nof three rivers. Pop. (1901) 67,903. It is really only a collection of\r\nvillages buried amid trees, with a clearing containing the palace of the\r\nraja, the cantonments, and the houses of the few European residents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPLEMENT (Lat. _implementum_, a filling up, from _implere_, to fill),\r\nin ordinary usage, a tool, especially in the plural for the set of tools\r\nnecessary for a particular trade or for completing a particular piece of\r\nwork (see TOOLS). It is also the most general term applied to the\r\nweapons and tools that remain of those used by primitive man. The Late\r\nLat. _implementum_, more usually in the plural, _implementa_, was used\r\nfor all the objects necessary to stock or \"fill up\" a house, farm, &c.;\r\nit was thus applied to furniture of a house, the vestments and sacred\r\nvessels of a church, and to articles of clothing, &c. The transition to\r\nthe necessary outfit of a trade, &c., is easy. In its original Latin\r\nsense of \"filling up,\" the term survives in Scots law, meaning full\r\nperformance or \"fulfilment\" of a contract, agreement, &c.; \"to\r\nimplement\" is thus also used in Scots law for to carry out, perform.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPLUVIUM, the Latin term for the sunk part of the floor in the atrium\r\nof a Greek or Roman house, which was contrived to receive the water\r\npassing through the compluvium (q.v.) of the roof. The impluvium was\r\ngenerally in marble and sunk about a foot below the floor of the atrium.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPOSITION (from Lat. _imponere_, to place or lay upon), in\r\necclesiastical usage, the \"laying on\" of hands by a bishop at the\r\nservices of confirmation and ordination as a sign that some special\r\nspiritual gift is conferred, or that the recipient is set apart for some\r\nspecial service or work. The word is also used of the levying of a\r\nburdensome or unfair tax or duty, and of a penalty, and hence is applied\r\nto a punishment task given to a schoolboy. From \"impose\" in the sense of\r\n\"to pass off\" on some one, imposition means also a trick or deception.\r\nIn the printing trade the term is used of the arrangement of pages of\r\ntype in the \"forme,\" being one of the stages between composing and\r\nprinting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPOST (through the O. Fr. from Lat. _impositum_, a thing laid upon\r\nanother; the modern French is _impôt_), a tax or tribute, and\r\nparticularly a duty levied on imported or exported merchandise (see\r\nTAXATION, CUSTOMS DUTIES, EXCISE, &c.). In architecture, \"impost\" (in\r\nGerman _Kaempfer_) is a term applied in Italian to the doorpost, but in\r\nEnglish restricted to the upper member of the same, from which the arch\r\nsprings. This may either be in the same plane as the arch mould or\r\nprojecting and forming a plain band or elaborately moulded, in which\r\ncase the mouldings are known as impost mouldings. Sometimes the complete\r\nentablature of a smaller order is employed, as in the case of the\r\nVenetian or Palladian window, where the central opening has an arch\r\nresting on the entablature of the pilasters which flank the smaller\r\nwindow on each side. In Romanesque and Gothic work the capitals with\r\ntheir abaci take the place of the impost mouldings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPOTENCE (Lat. _impotentia_, want of power), the term used in law for\r\nthe inability of a husband or wife to have marital intercourse. In\r\nEnglish matrimonial law if impotence exists in either of the parties to\r\na marriage at the time of its solemnization the marriage is voidable _ab\r\ninitio_. A suit for nullity on the ground of impotence can only be\r\nbrought by the party who suffers the injury. Third persons--however\r\ngreat their interest--cannot sue for a decree on this ground, nor can a\r\nmarriage be impeached after the death of one of the parties. The old\r\nrule of the ecclesiastical courts was to require a triennial\r\ncohabitation between the parties prior to the institution of the suit,\r\nbut this has been practically abrogated (_G._ v. _G._, 1871, L.R. 2\r\nP.C.D. 287). In suits for nullity on the ground of impotence, medical\r\nevidence as to the condition of the parties is necessary and a\r\ncommission of two medical inspectors is usually appointed by the\r\nregistrar of the court for the purpose of examining the parties; such\r\ncases are heard _in camera_. In the United States impotence is a ground\r\nfor nullity in most states. In Germany it is recognized as a ground for\r\nannulment, but not so in France.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPRESSIONISM. The word \"Impressionist\" has come to have a more general\r\napplication in England than in France, where it took currency as the\r\nnickname of a definite group of painters exhibiting together, and was\r\nadopted by themselves during the conflict of opinion which the novelty\r\nof their art excited. The word therefore belongs to the class of\r\nnicknames or battle-names, like \"Romanticist,\" \"Naturalist,\" \"Realist,\"\r\nwhich preceded it, words into which the acuteness of controversy infuses\r\nmore of theoretical purport than the work of the artists denoted\r\nsuggests to later times. The painters included in such a \"school\" differ\r\nso much among themselves, and so little from their predecessors compared\r\nwith the points of likeness, that we may well see in these recurring\r\neffervescences of official and popular distaste rather the shock of\r\nindividual force in the artist measured against contemporary mediocrity\r\nthan the disturbance of a new doctrine. The \"Olympia\" of Manet, hooted\r\nat the Salon of 1865 as subversive of all tradition, decency and beauty,\r\nstrikes the visitor to the Luxembourg rather as the reversion to a theme\r\nof Titian by an artist of ruder vision than as the demonstration of a\r\nrevolutionary in painting. Later developments of the school do appear to\r\nus revolutionary. With this warning in a matter still too near us for\r\nfinal judgment, we may give some account of the Impressionists proper,\r\nand then turn to the wider significance sometimes given to the name.\r\n\r\nThe words _Impressioniste_, _Impressionisme_, are said to have arisen\r\nfrom a phrase in the preface to Manet's catalogue of his pictures\r\nexhibited in 1867 during the Exposition Universelle, from which he was\r\nexcluded. \"It is the effect,\" he wrote, \"of sincerity to give to a\r\npainter's works a character that makes them resemble a protest, whereas\r\nthe painter has only thought of rendering his impression.\" An\r\nalternative origin is a catalogue in which Claude Monet entitled a\r\npicture of sunrise at sea \"Une Impression.\" The word was probably much\r\nused in the discussions of the group, and was caught up by the critics\r\nas characteristic.[1] At the earlier date the only meaning of the word\r\nwas a claim for individual liberty of subject and treatment. So far as\r\nsubject went, most, though not all of Manet's pictures were modern and\r\nactual of his Paris, for his power lay in the representation of the\r\nthing before his eye, and not in fanciful invention. His simplicity in\r\nthis respect brought him into collision with popular prejudice when, in\r\nthe \"Déjeuner sur l'herbe\" (1863), he painted a modern _fête champêtre_.\r\nThe actual characters of his painting at this period, so fancifully\r\nreproached and praised, may be grouped under two heads. (1) The\r\nexpression of the object by a few carefully chosen values in flattish\r\npatches. Those patches are placed side by side with little attenuation\r\nof their sharp collision. This simplification of colour and tone recalls\r\nby its broad effects of light and silhouette on the one hand Velasquez,\r\non the other the extreme simplification made by the Japanese for the\r\npurposes of colour-printing. Manet, like the other painters of his\r\ngroup, was influenced by these newly-discovered works of art. The image,\r\nthus treated, has remarkable hardiness and vigour, and also great\r\ndecorative breadth. Its vivacity and intensity of aspect is gained by\r\nthe sacrifice of many minor gradations, and by the judgment with which\r\nthe leading values have been determined. This matching of values\r\nproduces, technically, a \"solid\" painting, without glazing or elaborate\r\ntransparency in shadows. (2) During this period Manet makes constant\r\nprogress towards a fair, clear colour. In his early work the patches of\r\nblond colour are relieved against black shadows; later these shadows\r\nclear up, and in place of an indeterminate brown sauce we find shadows\r\nthat are colours. A typical picture of this period is the \"Musique aux\r\nTuileries,\" refused by the Salon of 1863. In this we have an actual\r\nout-of-doors scene rendered with a frankness and sharp taste of\r\ncontemporary life surprising to contemporaries, with an elision of\r\ndetail in the treatment of a crowd and a seizing on the chief colour\r\nnote and patch that characterize each figure equally surprising, an\r\neffort finally to render the total high-pitched gaiety of the spectacle\r\nas a banquet of sunlight and colour rather than a collection of separate\r\ndramatic groups.\r\n\r\n  For life of Édouard Manet (1832-1883) see Edmond Bazire, _Manet_\r\n  (Paris, 1884). An idea of the state of popular feeling may be gained\r\n  by reading Zola's eloquent defence in _Mon Salon_, which appeared in\r\n  _L'Événement_ (1866) and _Édouard Manet_ (1867), both reprinted in\r\n  _Mes Haines_ (Paris, 1880). The same author has embodied many of the\r\n  impressionist ideals in Claude Lantier, the fictitious hero of\r\n  _L'Oeuvre_. Other writers belonging to Manet's group are Théodore\r\n  Duret, author of _Les Peintres français en 1867_ and _Critique\r\n  d'avant-garde_, articles and catalogue-prefaces reprinted 1885. See\r\n  also, for Manet and others, J. K. Huysman's _L'Art moderne_ (1883) and\r\n  _Certains_. Summaries of the literature of the whole period will be\r\n  found in R. Muther, _The History of Modern Painting_ (tr. London,\r\n  1896), not always trustworthy in detail, and Miss R. G. Kingsley, _A\r\n  History of French Art_ (1899). For an interesting critical account see\r\n  W. C. Brownell, _French Art_ (1892).\r\n\r\nThe second period, to which the name is sometimes limited, is\r\ncomplicated by the emergence of new figures, and it is difficult as yet,\r\nand perhaps will always remain difficult, to say how much of originality\r\nbelongs to each artist in the group. The main features are an intenser\r\nstudy of illumination, a greater variety of illuminations, and a\r\nrevolution in _facture_ with a view to pressing closer to a high pitch\r\nof light. Manet plays his part in this development, but we shall not be\r\nwrong probably in giving to Claude Monet (b. 1840) the chief rôle as the\r\ninstinctive artist of the period, and to Camille Pissarro (b. 1830) a\r\nvery large part as a painter, curious in theory and experiment. Monet at\r\nthe early date of 1866 had painted a picture as daring in its naïve\r\nbrutality of out-of-door illumination as the \"Déjeuner sur l'herbe.\" But\r\nthis picture has the breadth of patch, solidity and suavity of paste of\r\nManet's practice. During the siege of Paris (1870-71) Monet and Pissarro\r\nwere in London, and there the study of Turner's pictures enlarged their\r\nideas of the pitch in lighting and range of effect possible in painting,\r\nand also suggested a new handling of colour, by small broken touches in\r\nplace of the large flowing touches characteristic of Manet. This method\r\nof painting occupied much of the discussion of the group that centred\r\nround Manet at the Café Guerbois, in the Batignolles quarter (hence\r\ncalled _L'École de Balignolles_). The ideas were: (1) Abolition of\r\nconventional brown tonality. But all browns, in the fervour of this\r\nrevolt, went the way of conventional brown, and all ready-made mixtures\r\nlike the umbers, ochres, siennas were banished from the palette. Black\r\nitself was condemned. (2) The idea of the spectrum, as exhibiting the\r\nseries of \"primary\" or \"pure\" colours, directed the reformed palette.\r\nSix colours, besides white, were admitted to represent the chief hues of\r\nthe spectrum. (3) These colours were laid on the canvas with as little\r\nprevious mixture on the palette as possible to maintain a maximum of\r\nluminosity, and were fused by touch on the canvas as little as possible,\r\nfor the same reason. Hence the \"broken\" character of the touch in this\r\npainting, and the subordination of delicacies of form and suave\r\ncontinuity of texture to the one aim of glittering light-and-colour\r\nnotation. Justification of these procedures was sought in occasional\r\nfeatures of the practice of E. Delacroix, of Watteau, of J. B. Chardin,\r\nin the hatchings of pastel, the stipple of water-colour. With the\r\nferment of theory went a _parti pris_ for translating all effects into\r\nthe upper registers of tone (cf. Ruskin's chapter on Turner's practice\r\nin _Modern Painters_), and for emphasizing the colour of shadows at the\r\nexpense of their tone. The characteristic work of this period is\r\nlandscape, as the subject of illumination strictly observed and followed\r\nthrough the round of the day and of the seasons. Other pictorial motives\r\nwere subordinated to this research of effect, and Monet, with a\r\nhaystack, group of poplars, or church front, has demonstrated the\r\nvariety of lighting that the day and the season bring to a single scene.\r\nBesides Pissarro, Alfred Sisley (1840-1899) is a member of the group,\r\nand Manet continues his progress, influenced by the new ideas in\r\npictures like \"Le Linge\" and \"Chez le Père Lathuille.\"\r\n\r\nEdmond Degas (b. 1834), a severe and learned draughtsman, is associated\r\nwith this landscape group by his curiosity in the expression of\r\nmomentary action and the effects of artificial illumination, and by his\r\nexperiments in broken colour, more particularly in pastel. The novelty\r\nof his matter, taken from unexplored corners of modern life, still more\r\nthe daring and irony of his observation and points of view, and the\r\nstrangeness of his composition, strongly influenced by Japanese art,\r\nenriched the associations now gathering about the word \"impressionist.\"\r\nAnother name, that of Auguste Renoir (b. 1841), completes the leading\r\nfigures of the group. Any \"school\" programme would be strained to\r\nbreaking-point to admit this painter, unless on the very general grounds\r\nof love of bright colour, sunlit places and independence of vision. He\r\nhas no science of drawing or of tone, but wins a precarious charm of\r\ncolour and expression.\r\n\r\n  The landscape, out-of-doors line, which unites in this period with\r\n  Manet's line, may be represented by these names: J. B. Corot, J. B.\r\n  Jongkind, Boudin, Monet. Monet's real teacher was Eugène Boudin\r\n  (1824-1898), (See Gustave Cahen's _Eugène Boudin_, Paris, 1900). They,\r\n  and others of the group, worked together in a painters' colony at\r\n  Saint Simeon, near Honfleur. It is usual to date the origin of\r\n  _plein-air_ painting, i.e. painting out-of-doors, in an out-of-doors\r\n  key of tone, from a picture Manet painted in the garden of de Nittis,\r\n  just before the outbreak of war in 1870. This dates only Manet's\r\n  change to the lighter key and looser handling. It was Monet who\r\n  carried the practice to a logical extreme, working on his canvas only\r\n  during the effect and in its presence. The method of Degas is\r\n  altogether different, viz., a combination in the studio from\r\n  innumerable notes and observations. It will be evident from what has\r\n  been said above that impressionistic painting is an artistic ferment,\r\n  corresponding to the scientific research into the principles of light\r\n  and colour, just as earlier movements in painting coincided with the\r\n  scientific study of perspective and anatomy. Chevreul's famous book,\r\n  already referred to, _De la loi du contraste simultané des couleurs_\r\n  (1838), established certain laws of interaction for colours adjacent\r\n  to one another. He still, however, referred the sensations of colour\r\n  to the three impossible \"primaries\" of Brewster--red, blue and yellow.\r\n  The Young-Helmholtz theory affected the palette of the Impressionists,\r\n  and the work of Ogden Rood, _Colour_ (Internat. Scientific Series,\r\n  1879-1881), published in English, French and German, furnished the\r\n  theorists with formulae measuring the degradation of pitch suffered by\r\n  pigments in mixture.\r\n\r\n  The Impressionist group (with the exception of Manet, who still fought\r\n  for his place in the Salon) exhibited together for the first time as\r\n  L'Exposition des Impressionistes at Nadar's, Boulevard des Capucines,\r\n  in 1874. They were then taken up by the dealer Durand-Ruel, and the\r\n  succeeding exhibitions in 1876, 1877, 1879, 1880, 1881, 1882 and 1886\r\n  were held by him in various galleries. The full history of these\r\n  exhibitions, with the names of the painters, will be found in two\r\n  works: Félix-Fénéon, _Les Impressionistes en 1886_ (Paris, 1886), and\r\n  G. Geffroy, _La Vie artistique_ (\"Histoire de l'impressionisme,\" in\r\n  vol. for 1894). See also G. Lecomte, _L'Art impressionists d'après la\r\n  collection privée de M. Durand-Ruel_ (Paris, 1892); Duranty, _La\r\n  Peinture nouvelle_ (1876). Besides the names already cited, some\r\n  others may be added: Madame Berthe Morisot, sister-in-law of Manet;\r\n  Paul Cézanne, belonging to the Manet-Pissarro group; and, later,\r\n  Gauguin. J. F. Raffaëlli applied a \"characteristic\" drawing, to use\r\n  his word, to scenes in the dismal suburbs of Paris; Forain, the\r\n  satiric draughtsman, was a disciple of Degas, as also Zandomeneghi.\r\n  Miss Mary Cassatt was his pupil. Caillebotte, who bequeathed the\r\n  collection of Impressionist paintings now in the Luxembourg, was also\r\n  an exhibitor; and Boudin, who linked the movement to the earlier\r\n  schools.\r\n\r\n  The first exhibitions of the Impressionists in London were in 1882 and\r\n  1883, but their fortunes there cannot be pursued in the present\r\n  article, nor the history of the movement beyond its originators. This\r\n  excludes notable figures, of which M. Besnard may be chosen as a type.\r\n\r\nIn Manet's painting, even in the final steps he took towards \"la\r\npeinture claire,\" there is nothing of the \"decomposition of tones\" that\r\nlogically followed from the theories of his followers. He recognized the\r\nexistence in certain illuminations of the violet shadow, and he adopted\r\nin open-air work a looser and more broken touch. The nature of his\r\nsubjects encouraged such a handling, for the painter who attempts to\r\nnote from nature the colour values of an elusive effect must treat form\r\nin a summary fashion, still more so when the material is in constant\r\nmovement like water. Moreover, in the river-side subjects near Paris\r\nthere was a great deal that was only pictorially tolerable when its tone\r\nwas subtracted from the details of its form. Monet's painting carries\r\nthe shorthand of form and broken colour to extremity; the flowing touch\r\nof Manet is chopped up into harsher, smaller notes of tone, and the\r\npitch pushed up till all values approach the iridescent end of the\r\nregister. It was in 1886 that the _doctrinaire_ ferment came to a head,\r\nand what was supposed to be a scientific method of colour was\r\nformulated. This was _pointillisme_, the resolution of the colours of\r\nnature back into six bands of the rainbow or spectrum, and their\r\nrepresentation on the canvas by _dots_ of unmixed pigment. These dots,\r\nat a sufficient distance, combine their hues in the eye with the effect\r\nof a mixture of coloured _lights_, not of pigments, so that the result\r\nis an increase instead of a loss of luminosity. There are several\r\nfallacies, however, theoretical and practical, in this \"spectral\r\npalette\" and pointillist method. If we depart from the three primaries\r\nof the Helmholtz hypothesis, there is no reason why we should stop at\r\nsix hues instead of six hundred. But pigments follow the spectrum series\r\nso imperfectly that the three primaries, even if we could exactly locate\r\nthem, limit the palette considerably in its upper range. The sacrifice\r\nof black is quite illogical, and the lower ranges suffer accordingly.\r\nMoreover, it is doubtful whether many painters have followed the laws of\r\nmixture of lights in their dotting, e.g. dotting green and red together\r\nto produce yellow. It may be added that dotting with oil pigment is in\r\npractice too coarse and inaccurate a method. This innovation of\r\n_pointillisme_ is generally ascribed to George Seurat (d. 1890), whose\r\npicture, \"La Grande Jatte,\" was exhibited at the Rue Laffitte in 1886.\r\nPissarro experimented in the new method, but abandoned it, and other\r\nnames among the _Pointillistes_ are Paul Signac, Vincent van Gogh, and\r\nvan Rysselberghe. The theory opened the way for endless casuistries, and\r\nits extravagances died out in the later exhibition of the _Indépendants_\r\nor were domesticated in the Salon by painters like M. Henri Martin.\r\n\r\n  The first modern painter to concern himself scientifically with the\r\n  reactions of complementary colours appears to have been Delacroix (J.\r\n  Leonardo, it should be remembered, left some notes on the subject). It\r\n  is claimed for Delacroix that as early as 1825 he observed and made\r\n  use of these reactions, anticipating the complete exposition of\r\n  Chevreul. He certainly studied the treatise, and his biographers\r\n  describe a dial-face he constructed for reference. He had quantities\r\n  of little wafers of each colour, with which he tried colour effects, a\r\n  curious anticipation of pointillist technique. The pointillists claim\r\n  him as their grandfather. See Paul Signac, \"D'Eugène Delacroix au\r\n  Néo-Impressionnisme\" (_Revue Blanche_, 1898). For a fuller discussion\r\n  of the spectral palette see the _Saturday Review_, 2nd, 9th and 23rd\r\n  February and 23rd March 1901.\r\n\r\nIn England the ideas connected with the word Impressionism have been\r\nrefracted through the circumstances of the British schools. The\r\nquestions of pitch of light and iridescent colour had already arisen\r\nover the work of Turner, of the Pre-Raphaelites, and also of G. F.\r\nWatts, but less isolated and narrowed, because the art of none of these\r\nlimited itself to the pursuit of light. _Pointillisme_, after a fashion,\r\nexisted in British water-colour practice. But the Pre-Raphaelite school\r\nhad accustomed the English eye to extreme definition in painting and to\r\nelaboration of detail, and it happened that the painting of James\r\nM'Neill Whistler (Grosvenor Gallery, 1878) brought the battle-name\r\nImpressionism into England and gave it a different colour. Whistler's\r\nmethod of painting was in no way revolutionary, and he preferred to\r\ntranspose values into a lower key rather than compete with natural\r\npitch, but his vision, like that of Manet under the same influences,\r\nSpanish and Japanese, simplified tone and subordinated detail. These\r\ncharacteristics raised the whole question of _the science and art of\r\naspect in modern painting_, and the field of controversy was extended\r\nbackwards to Velasquez as the chief master of the moderns.\r\n\"Impressionism\" at first had meant individualism of vision, later the\r\nnotation of fugitive aspects of light and of movement; now it came to\r\nmean breadth in pictorial vision, all the simplifications that arise\r\nfrom the modern analysis of aspect, and especially the effect produced\r\nupon the parts of a picture-field by attending to _the impression of the\r\nwhole_. Ancient painting analyses aspect into three separate acts as\r\nform, tone and colour. All forms are made out with equal clearness by a\r\nconventional outline; over this system of outlines a second system of\r\nlight and shade is passed, and over this again a system of colours. Tone\r\nis conceived as a difference of black or white added to the tints, and\r\nthe colours are the definite local tints of the objects (a blue, a red,\r\na yellow, and so forth). In fully developed modern painting, instead of\r\nan object analysed into sharp outlines covered with a uniform colour\r\ndarkened or lightened in places, we find an object analysed into a\r\nnumber of surfaces or planes set at different angles. On each of these\r\nfacets the character of the object and of the illumination, with\r\naccidents of reflection, produces a patch called by modern painters a\r\n\"value,\" because it is colour of a particular value or tone. (With each\r\ndifference of tone, \"value\" implies a difference of hue also, so that\r\nwhen we speak of a different tone of the same colour we are using the\r\nword \"same\" in a loose or approximate sense.) These planes or facets\r\ndefine themselves one against another with greater or less sharpness.\r\nModern technique follows this modern analysis of vision, and in one act\r\ninstead of three renders by a \"touch\" of paint the shape and value of\r\nthese facets, and instead of imposing a uniform ideal outline at all\r\ntheir junctions, allows these patches to define themselves against one\r\nanother with variable sharpness.\r\n\r\nBlurred definition, then, as it exists in our natural view of things, is\r\nadmitted into painting; a blurring that may arise from distance, from\r\nvapour or smoke, from brilliant light, from obscurity, or simply from\r\nthe nearness in value of adjacent objects. Similarly, much detail that\r\nin primitive art is elaborated is absorbed by rendering the aspect\r\ninstead of the facts known to make up that aspect. Thus hair and fur,\r\nthe texture of stuffs, the blades of grass at a little distance, become\r\npatches of tone showing only their larger constructive markings. But the\r\nblurring of definitions and the elimination of detail that we find in\r\nmodern pictorial art are not all of this ready-made character. We have\r\nso far only the scientific analysis of a field of view. If the painter\r\nwere a scientific reporter he would have to pursue the systems of\r\nplanes, with their shapes and values, to infinity. Impressionism is the\r\nart that surveys the field and determines which of the shapes and tones\r\nare of chief importance to the _interested_ eye, enforces these, and\r\nsacrifices the rest. Construction, the logic of the object rendered,\r\ndetermines partly this action of the eye, and also decoration, the\r\neffects of rhythm in line and harmony in fields of colour. These motives\r\nbelong to all art, but the specially impressionist motive is the act of\r\n_attention_ as it affects the aspect of the field. We are familiar, in\r\nthe ordinary use of the eye, with two features of its structure that\r\nlimit clearness of vision. There is, first, the spot of clear vision on\r\nthe retina, outside of which all falls away into blur; there is,\r\nsecondly, the action of _focus_. As the former limits clear definition\r\nto one spot in the field extended vertically and laterally, so focus\r\nlimits clear definition to one plane in the third dimension, viz. depth.\r\nIf three objects, A, B and C, stand at different depths before the eye,\r\nwe can at will fix A, whereupon B and C must fall out of focus, or B,\r\nwhereupon A and C must be blurred, or C, sacrificing the clearness of A\r\nand B. All this apparatus makes it impossible to see everything at once\r\nwith equal clearness, enables us, and forces us for the uses of real\r\nlife, to frame and limit our picture, according to the immediate\r\ninterest of the eye, whatever it may be. The painter instinctively uses\r\nthese means to arrive at the emphasis and neglect that his choice\r\nrequires. If he is engaged on a face he will now screw his attention to\r\na part and now relax it, distributing the attention over the whole so as\r\nto restore the bigger relations of aspect. Sir Joshua Reynolds describes\r\nthis process as seeing the whole \"with the dilated eye\"; the commoner\r\nprecept of the studios is \"to look with the eyes half closed\"; a third\r\nway is to throw the whole voluntarily out of focus. In any case the\r\nresult is that minor planes are swamped in bigger, that smaller patches\r\nof colour are swept up into broader, that markings are blurred. The\r\nfinal result of these tentative reviews records, in what is blurred and\r\nwhat is clear, the attention that has been distributed to different\r\nparts, and to parts measured against the whole. The Impressionist\r\npainter does not allot so much detail to a face in a full-length\r\nportrait as to a head alone, nor to twenty figures on a canvas as to\r\none. Again, he indicates by his treatment of planes and definitions\r\nwhether the main subject of his picture is in the foreground or the\r\ndistance. He persuades the eye to slip over hosts of near objects so\r\nthat, as in life, it may hit a distant target, or concentrate its attack\r\non what is near, while the distance falls away into a dim curtain. All\r\nthose devices by which attention is directed and distributed, and the\r\nimportance in space of an object established, affect impressionistic\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\nIt is an inevitable misunderstanding of painting which plays the game of\r\nart so closely up to the real aspects of nature that its aim is that of\r\nmere exact copying. Painting like Manet's, accused of being realistic in\r\nthis sense, sufficiently disproves the accusation when examined. Never\r\ndid painting show a _parti pris_ more pronounced, even more violent. The\r\nelisions and assertions by which Manet selects what he finds significant\r\nand beautiful in the complete natural image are startling to the stupid\r\nrealist, and the Impressionist may best be described as the painter who\r\nout of the completed contents of vision constructs an image moulded upon\r\nhis own interest in the thing seen and not on that of any imaginary\r\nschoolmaster. Accepting the most complex terms of nature with their\r\nspecial emotions, he uses the same freedom of sacrifice as the man who\r\nat the other end of the scale expresses his interest in things by a few\r\nscratches of outline. The perpetual enemy of both is the eclectic, who\r\nworks for possible interests not his own.\r\n\r\n  Some of the points touched on above will be found amplified in\r\n  articles by the writer in _The Albemarle_ (September 1892), the\r\n  _Fortnightly Review_ (June 1894), and _The Artist_ (March-July 1896).\r\n  An admirable exposition of Impressionism in this sense is R. A. M.\r\n  Stevenson's _The Art of Velasquez_ (1895). Mr Stevenson was trained in\r\n  the school of Carolus Duran, where impressionist painting was reduced\r\n  to a system. Mr Sargent's painting is a brilliant example of the\r\n  system.     (D. S. M.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n  [1] Mr H. P. Hain Friswell has pointed out that the word \"impression\"\r\n    occurs frequently in Chevreul's book on colour; but it is also\r\n    current among the critics. See Ruskin's chapter on Turner's\r\n    composition--\"impression on the mind.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPRESSMENT, the name given in English to the exercise of the authority\r\nof the state to \"press\"[1] or compel the service of the subject for the\r\ndefence of the realm. Every sovereign state must claim and at times\r\nexercise this power. The \"drafting\" of men for service in the American\r\nCivil War was a form of impressment. All the monarchical, or republican,\r\ngovernments of Europe have employed the press at one time or another.\r\nAll forms of conscription, including the English ballot for the militia,\r\nare but regulations of this sovereign right. In England impressment may\r\nbe looked upon as an erratic, and often oppressive, way of enforcing the\r\ncommon obligation to serve in \"the host\" or in the _posse comitatus_\r\n(power of the county). In Scotland, where the feudal organization was\r\nvery complete in the Lowlands, and the tribal organization no less\r\ncomplete in the Highlands, and where the state was weak, impressment was\r\noriginally little known. After the union of the two parliaments in 1707,\r\nno distinction was made between the two divisions of Great Britain. In\r\nEngland the kings of the Plantagenet dynasty caused Welshmen to be\r\npressed by the Lords Marchers, and Irish kerns to be pressed by the\r\nLords Deputy, for their wars in France. Complaints were made by\r\nparliament of the oppressive use of this power as early as the reign of\r\nEdward III., but it continued to be exercised. Readers of Shakespeare\r\nwill remember Sir John Falstaff's commission to press soldiers, and the\r\nmanner, justified no doubt by many and familiar examples of the way in\r\nwhich the duty was performed. A small sum called imprest-money, or coat\r\nand conduct money, was given to the men when pressed to enable them to\r\nreach the appointed rendezvous. Soldiers were secured in this way by\r\nQueen Elizabeth, by King Charles I., and by the parliament itself in the\r\nCivil War. The famous New Model Army of Cromwell was largely raised by\r\nimpressment. Parliament ordered the county committees to select recruits\r\nof \"years meet for their employment and well clothed.\" After the\r\nRevolution of 1688 parliament occasionally made use of this resource. In\r\n1779 a general press of all rogues and vagabonds in London to be drafted\r\ninto the regiments was ordered. It is said that all who were not too\r\nlame to run away or too destitute to bribe the parish constable were\r\nswept into the net. As they were encouraged to desert by the undisguised\r\nconnivance of the officers and men who were disgusted with their\r\ncompany, no further attempt to use the press for the army was made.\r\n\r\nA distinction between the liability of sailors and of other men dates\r\nfrom the 16th century. From an act of Philip and Mary (1556) it appears\r\nthat the watermen of the Thames claimed exemption from the press as a\r\nprivileged body. They were declared liable, and the liability was\r\nclearly meant to extend to service as a soldier on shore. In the fifth\r\nyear of Queen Elizabeth (1563) an act was passed to define the liability\r\nof the sailors. It is known as \"an Act touching politick considerations\r\nfor the maintenance of the Navy.\" By its term all fishermen and mariners\r\nwere protected from being compelled \"to serve as any soldiers upon the\r\nLand or upon the Sea, otherwise than as a mariner, except it shall be to\r\nserve under any Captain of some ship or vessel, for landing to do some\r\nspecial exploit which mariners have been used to do.\" The operation of\r\nthe act was limited to ten years, but it was renewed repeatedly, and was\r\nat last indefinitely prolonged in the sixteenth year of the reign of\r\nCharles I. (1631). By the Vagrancy Act of the close of Queen Elizabeth's\r\nreign (1597), disorderly serving-men and other disreputable characters,\r\nof whom a formidable list is given, were declared to be liable to be\r\nimpressed for service in the fleet. The \"Takers,\" as they were called in\r\nearly times, the Press Gang of later days, were ordered to present their\r\ncommission to two justices of the peace, who were bound to pick out\r\n\"such sufficient number of able men, as in the said commission shall be\r\ncontained, to serve Her Majesty as aforesaid.\" The justices of the peace\r\nin the coast districts, who were often themselves concerned in the\r\nshipping trade, were not always zealous in enforcing the press. The\r\npressed sailors often deserted with the \"imprest money\" given them. Loud\r\ncomplaints were made by the naval officers of the bad quality of the men\r\nsent up to serve in the king's ships. On the other hand, the Press Gangs\r\nwere accused of extorting money, and of making illegal arrests. In the\r\nreign of Queen Anne (1703) an act was passed \"for the increase of Seamen\r\nand the better encouragement of navigation, and the protection of the\r\nCoal Trade.\" The act which gave parish authorities power to apprentice\r\nboys to the sea exempted the apprentices from the press for three years,\r\nand until the age of eighteen. It especially reaffirmed the part of the\r\nVagrancy Act of Elizabeth's reign which left rogues and vagabonds\r\nsubject to be pressed for the sea service. By the act for the \"Increase\r\nof Mariners and Seamen to navigate Merchant Ships and other trading\r\nships or vessels,\" passed in the reign of George II. (1740), all men\r\nover fifty-five were exempted from the press together with lads under\r\neighteen, foreigners serving in British ships (always numerous in war\r\ntime), and landsmen who had gone to sea during their first two years.\r\nThe act for \"the better supplying of the cities of London and\r\nWestminster with fish\" gave exemption to all masters of fishing-boats,\r\nto four apprentices and one mariner to each boat, and all landsmen for\r\ntwo years, except in case of actual invasion. By the act for the\r\nencouragement of insurance passed in 1774, the fire insurance companies\r\nin London were entitled to secure exemption for thirty watermen each in\r\ntheir employment. Masters and mates of merchant vessels, and a\r\nproportion of men per ship in the colliers trading from the north to\r\nLondon, were also exempt.\r\n\r\nSubject to such limitations as these, all seafaring men, and watermen\r\non rivers, were liable to be pressed between the ages of eighteen and\r\nfifty-five, and might be pressed repeatedly for so long as their\r\nliability lasted. The rogue and vagabond element were at the mercy of\r\nthe justices of the peace. The frightful epidemics of fever which\r\ndesolated the navy till late in the 18th century were largely due to the\r\ninfection brought by the prisoners drafted from the ill-kept jails of\r\nthe time. As service in the fleet was most unpopular with the sailors,\r\nthe press could often only be enforced by making a parade of strength\r\nand employing troops. The men had many friends who were always willing\r\nto conceal them, and they themselves became expert in avoiding capture.\r\nThere was, however, one way of procuring them which gave them no chance\r\nof evasion. The merchant ships were stopped at sea and the sailors taken\r\nout. This was done to a great extent, more especially in the case of\r\nhomeward-bound vessels. On one occasion, in 1802, an East Indiaman on\r\nher way home was deprived of so many of her crew by a man of war in the\r\nBay of Biscay that she was unable to resist a small French privateer,\r\nand was carried off as a prize with a valuable cargo. The press and the\r\njails failed to supply the number of men required. In 1795 it was found\r\nnecessary to impose on the counties the obligation to provide \"a quota\"\r\nof men, at their own expense. The local authorities provided the\r\nrecruits by offering high bounties, often to debtors confined in the\r\nprisons. These desperate men were a very bad element in the navy. In\r\n1797 they combined with the United Irishmen, of whom large numbers had\r\nbeen drafted into the fleet as vagabonds, to give a very dangerous\r\npolitical character to the mutinies at the Nore and on the south of\r\nIreland. After the conclusion of the great Napoleonic wars in 1815 the\r\npower of the press was not again exercised. In 1835 an act was passed\r\nduring Sir James Graham's tenure of office as first lord of the\r\nadmiralty, by which men who had once been pressed and had served for a\r\nperiod of five years were to be exempt from impressment in future. Sir\r\nJames, however, emphatically reaffirmed the right of the crown to\r\nenforce the service of the subject, and therefore to impress the seamen.\r\nThe introduction of engagements for a term of five years in 1853, and\r\nthen of long service, has produced so large a body of voluntary\r\nrecruits, and service in the navy is so popular, that the question has\r\nno longer any interest save an historical one. If compulsory service in\r\nthe fleet should again become necessary it will not be in the form of\r\nthe old system of impressment, which left the sailor subject to\r\ncompulsory service from the age of eighteen to fifty-five, and flooded\r\nthe navy with the scum of the jails and the workhouse.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--Grose's _Military Antiquities_, for the general subject\r\n  of impressment, vol. ii. p. 73 et seq. S. R. Gardiner gives many\r\n  details in his history of James I. and Charles I., and in _The Civil\r\n  War_. The acts relating to the navy are quoted in _A Collection of the\r\n  Statutes relating to the Admiralty_, &c., published in 1810. Some\r\n  curious information is in the papers relating to the Brest Blockade\r\n  edited by John Leyland for the Navy Record Society. Sir James Graham's\r\n  speech is in Hansard for 1835.     (D. H.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n  [1] It is now accepted generally that \"to press\" is a corruption of\r\n    \"prest,\" as \"impress\" is of \"imprest,\" but the word was quite early\r\n    connected with \"press,\" to squeeze, crush, hence to compel or force.\r\n    The \"prest\" was a sum of money advanced (O. Fr. _prester_, modern\r\n    _prêter_, to lend, Lat. _praestare_, to stand before, provide, become\r\n    surety for, &c.) to a person to enable him to perform some\r\n    undertaking, hence used of earnest money given to soldiers on\r\n    enlistment, or as the \"coat and conduct\" money alluded to in this\r\n    article. The methods of compulsion used to get men for military\r\n    service naturally connected the word with \"to press\" (Lat.\r\n    _pressare_, frequentative of _premere_) to force, and all reference\r\n    to the money advanced was lost (see _Skeat, Etym. Dict._, 1898, and\r\n    the quotation from H. Wedgwood, _Dict. of Eng. Etym._).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROMPTU (from _in promptu_, on the spur of the moment), a short\r\nliterary composition which has not been, or is not supposed to have\r\nbeen, prepared beforehand, but owes its merit to the ready skill which\r\nproduces it without premeditation. The word seems to have been\r\nintroduced from the French language in the middle of the 17th century.\r\nWithout question, the poets have, from earliest ages, made impromptus,\r\nand the very art of poetry, in its lyric form, is of the nature of a\r\nmodified improvisation. It is supposed that many of the epigrams of the\r\nGreeks, and still more probably those of the Roman satirists,\r\nparticularly Martial, were delivered on the moment, and gained a great\r\npart, at least, of their success from the evidence which they gave of\r\nrapidity of invention. But it must have been difficult then, as it has\r\nbeen since, to be convinced of the value of that evidence. Who is to be\r\nsure that, like Mascarille in _Les Précieuses ridicules_, the\r\nimpromptu-writer has not employed his leisure in sharpening his arrows?\r\nJames Smith received the highest praise for his compliment to Miss Tree,\r\nthe cantatrice:--\r\n\r\n  On this tree when a nightingale settles and sings,\r\n  The Tree will return him as good as he brings.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was extremely neat, but who is to say that James Smith had not\r\npolished it as he dressed for dinner? One writer owed all his fame, and\r\na seat among the Forty Immortals of the French Academy, to the\r\nreputation of his impromptus. This was the Marquis François Joseph de St\r\nAulaire (1643-1742). The piece which threw open the doors of the Academy\r\nto him in 1706 was composed at Sceaux, where he was staying with the\r\nduchess of Maine, who was guessing secrets, and who called him Apollo.\r\nSt Aulaire instantly responded:--\r\n\r\n          La divinité qui s'amuse\r\n          A me demander mon secret,\r\n  Si j'étais Apollon, ne serait pas ma muse,\r\n  Elle serait Thétis--et le jour finirait.\r\n\r\nThis is undoubtedly as neat as it is impertinent, and if the duchess had\r\ngiven him no ground for preparation, this is typical of the impromptu at\r\nits best. Voltaire was celebrated for the savage wit of his impromptus,\r\nand was himself the subject of a famous one by Young. Less well known\r\nbut more certainly extemporaneous is the couplet by the last-mentioned\r\npoet, who being asked to put something amusing in an album, and being\r\nobliged to borrow from Lord Chesterfield a pencil for the purpose,\r\nwrote:--\r\n\r\n  Accept a miracle instead of wit,--\r\n  See two dull lines with Stanhope's pencil writ.\r\n\r\nThe word \"impromptu\" is sometimes used to designate a short dramatic\r\nsketch, the type of which is Molière's famous _Impromptu du Versailles_\r\n(1663), a miniature comedy in prose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVISATORE, a word used to describe a poet who recites verses which\r\nhe composes on the spur of the moment, without previous preparation. The\r\nterm is purely Italian, although in that language it would be more\r\ncorrectly spelt _improvvisatore_. It became recognized as an English\r\nword in the middle of the eighteenth century, and is so used by Smollett\r\nin his _Travels_ (1766); he defines an improvisatore as \"an individual\r\nwho has the surprising talent of reciting verses extempore, on any\r\nsubject you propose.\" In speaking of a woman, the female form\r\n_improvisatrice_ is sometimes used in English.\r\n\r\nImprovisation is a gift which properly belongs to those languages in\r\nwhich a great variety of grammatical inflections, wedded to simplicity\r\nof rhythm and abundance of rhyme, enable a poet to slur over\r\ndifficulties in such a way as to satisfy the ear of his audience. In\r\nancient times the greater part of the popular poetry with which the\r\nleisure of listeners was beguiled was of this rhapsodical nature. But in\r\nmodern Europe it was the troubadours, owing to the extreme flexibility\r\nof the languages of Provence, who distinguished themselves above all\r\nothers as improvisatores. It is difficult to believe, however, that the\r\nelaborate compositions of these poets, which have come down to us, in\r\nwhich every exquisite artifice of versification is taken advantage of,\r\ncan have been poured forth without premeditation. These poets, we must\r\nrather suppose, took a pride in the ostentation of a prodigious memory,\r\nmost carefully trained, and poured forth in public what they had\r\nlaboriously learned by heart in private. The Italians, however, in the\r\n16th century, cultivated what seems to have been a genuine\r\nimprovisation, in which the bards rhapsodized, not as they themselves\r\npleased, but on subjects which were unexpected by them, and which were\r\nchosen on the spot by their patrons. Of these, the most extraordinary is\r\nsaid to have been Silvio Antoniano (1540-1603), who from the age of ten\r\nwas able to pour out melodious verse on any subject which was suggested\r\nto him. He was brought to Rome, where successive popes so delighted in\r\nhis talent that in 1598 he was made a cardinal. In the 17th century the\r\ncelebrated Metastasio first attracted attention by his skill as an\r\nimprovisatore. But he was excelled by Bernardino Perfetti (1681-1747),\r\nwho was perhaps the most extraordinary genius of this class who has ever\r\nlived. He was seized, in his moments of composition, with a transport\r\nwhich transfigured his whole person, and under this excitement he poured\r\nforth verses in a miraculous flow. It was his custom to be attended by a\r\nguitarist, who played a recitative accompaniment. In this way Perfetti\r\nmade a triumphal procession through the cities of Italy, ending up with\r\nthe Capitol of Rome, where Pope Benedict XIII. crowned him with laurel,\r\nand created him a Roman citizen. One of the most remarkable\r\nimprovisatores of modern times appeared in Sweden, in the person of Karl\r\nMikael Bellman (1740-1795), who used to take up a position in the public\r\ngardens and parks of Stockholm, accompanying himself on a guitar, and\r\ntreating metre and rhythm with a virtuosity and originality which place\r\nhim among the leading poets of Swedish literature. In England, somewhat\r\nlater, Theodore Hook (1788-1841) developed a surprising talent for this\r\nkind, but his verses were rarely of the serious or sentimental character\r\nof which we have hitherto spoken. Hook's animal spirits were\r\nunfortunately mingled with vulgarity, and his clever _jeux d'esprit_ had\r\nlittle but their smartness to recommend them. A similar talent,\r\nexercised in a somewhat more literary direction, made Joseph Méry\r\n(1798-1865) a delightful companion in the Parisian society of his day.\r\nIt is rare indeed that the productions of the improvisatore, taken down\r\nin shorthand, and read in the cold light of criticism, are found to\r\njustify the impression which the author produced on his original\r\naudience. Imperfections of every kind become patent when we read these\r\ntranscripts, and the reader cannot avoid perceiving weaknesses of style\r\nand grammar. The eye and voice of the improvisatore so hypnotize his\r\nauditors as to make them incapable of forming a sober judgment on\r\nmatters of mere literature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN-ANTIS, the architectural term given to those temples the entrance\r\npart of which consisted of two columns placed between the antae or\r\npilasters (see TEMPLE).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINAUDI, JACQUES (1867-   ), Italian calculating prodigy, was born at\r\nOnorato, Piedmont, on the 15th of October 1867. When between seven and\r\neight years old, at which time he was employed in herding sheep, he\r\nalready exhibited an extraordinary aptitude for mental calculation. His\r\npowers attracted the notice of various showmen, and he commenced to give\r\nexhibitions. He was carefully examined by leading French scientists,\r\nincluding Charcot, from the physiological, psychological and\r\nmathematical point of view. The secret of his arithmetical powers\r\nappeared to reside in his extraordinary memory, improved by continuous\r\npractice. It appeared to depend upon hearing rather than sight, more\r\nremarkable results being achieved when figures were read out than when\r\nthey were written.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINCANTATION, the use of words, spoken, sung or chanted, usually as a set\r\nformula, for the purpose of obtaining a result by their supposed magical\r\npower. The word is derived from the Latin _incantare_, to chant a\r\nmagical formula; cf. the use of _carmen_, for such a formula of words.\r\nThe Latin use is very early; thus it appears in a fragment of the XII.\r\nTables quoted in Pliny (_N.H._ xxviii. 2, 4, 17), \"Qui malum carmen\r\nincantasset.\" From the O. Fr. derivative of _incantare_, _enchanter_,\r\ncomes \"enchant,\" \"enchantment,\" &c., properly of the exercise of magical\r\npowers, hence to charm, to fascinate, words which also by origin are of\r\nmagical significance. The early magi of Assyria and Babylonia were\r\nadepts at this art, as is evident from the examples of Akkadian spells\r\nthat have been discovered. Daniel (v. 11) is spoken of as \"master of the\r\nenchanters\" of Babylon. In Egypt and in India many formulas of religious\r\nmagic were in use, witness especially the Vedic _mantras_, which are\r\nclosely akin to the Maori _karakias_ and the North American _matamanik_.\r\nAmong the holy men presented by the king of Korea to the mikado of Japan\r\nin A.D. 577 was a reciter of _mantras_, who would find himself at home\r\nwith the _majinahi_ or incantation practised by the ancient Japanese for\r\ndissipating evil influences. One of the most common, widespread and\r\npersistent uses of incantation was in healing wounds, instances of which\r\nare found in the _Odyssey_ and the _Kalevala_, and in the traditional\r\nfolk-lore of almost every European country. Similar songs were sung to\r\nwin back a faithless lover (cf. the second _Idyll_ of Theocritus).\r\n\r\n  See further MAGIC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINCE, WILLIAM, English 18th century furniture designer and cabinetmaker.\r\nHe was one of the most successful imitators of Chippendale, although his\r\nwork was in many respects lighter. He helped, indeed, to build the\r\nbridge between the massive and often florid style of Chippendale and\r\nthe more boudoir-like forms of Hepplewhite. Although many of his designs\r\nwere poor and extravagant, his best work was very good indeed. His\r\nchairs are sometimes mistaken for those of Chippendale, to which,\r\nhowever, they are much inferior. He greatly affected the Chinese and\r\nGothic tastes of the second half of the 18th century. He was for many\r\nyears in partnership in Broad Street, Golden Square, London, with Thomas\r\nMayhew (q.v.), in collaboration with whom he published a folio volume of\r\nninety-five plates, with letterpress in English and French under the\r\ntitle of _The Universal System of Household Furniture_ (undated, but\r\nprobably about 1762).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINCE-IN-MAKERFIELD, an urban district in the Ince parliamentary division\r\nof Lancashire, England, adjoining the borough of Wigan. Pop. (1901)\r\n21,262. The Leeds and Liverpool Canal intersects the township. There are\r\nlarge collieries, ironworks, forges, railway wagon works, and cotton\r\nmills. There is preserved here the Old Hall, a beautiful example of\r\nhalf-timbered architecture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINCENDIARISM (Lat. _incendere_, to set on fire, burn), in law, the\r\nwilful or malicious burning of the house or property of another, and\r\npunishable as arson (q.v.). It may be noted that in North Carolina it is\r\nprovided in case of fires that there is to be a preliminary\r\ninvestigation by local authorities: all towns and cities have to make an\r\nannual inspection of buildings and a quarterly inspection within fire\r\nlimits and report to the state insurance commissioner; all expenses so\r\nincurred are met by a tax of 1/5% on the gross receipts of the insurance\r\ncompanies (L. 1903, ch. 719).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINCENSE,[1] the perfume (fumigation) arising from certain resins and\r\ngum-resins, barks, woods, dried flowers, fruits and seeds, when burnt,\r\nand also the substances so burnt. In its literal meaning the word\r\n\"incense\" is one with the word \"perfume,\" the aroma given off with the\r\nsmoke (_per fumum_[2]) of any odoriferous substance when burnt. But, in\r\nuse, while the meaning of the word \"perfume\" has been extended so as to\r\ninclude everything sweet in smell, from smoking incense to the invisible\r\nfresh fragrance of fruits and exquisite scent of flowers, that of the\r\nword \"incense,\" in all the languages of modern Europe in which it\r\noccurs, has, by an opposite process of limitation, been gradually\r\nrestricted almost exclusively to frankincense (see FRANKINCENSE).\r\nFrankincense has always been obtainable in Europe in greater quantity\r\nthan any other of the aromatics imported from the East; it has therefore\r\ngradually come to be the only incense used in the religious rites and\r\ndomestic fumigations of many countries of the West, and at last to be\r\nproperly regarded as the only \"true\" or \"genuine\" (i.e. \"franc\") incense\r\n(see Littré's _Fr. Dict._ and Skeat's _Etym. Dict. of Engl. Lang._).[3]\r\n\r\n  The following is probably an exhaustive list of the substances\r\n  available for incense or perfume mentioned in the Hebrew\r\n  Scriptures:--Algum or almug wood (almug in 1 Kings x. 11, 12; algum\r\n  in 2 Chron. ii. 8, and ix. 10, 11), generally identified with\r\n  sandalwood (_Santalum album_), a native of Malabar and Malaya; aloes,\r\n  or lign aloes (Heb. _ahalim_, _ahaloth_), produced by the _Aloexylon\r\n  Agallochum_ (Loureiro), a native of Cochin-China, and _Aquilaria\r\n  Agallocha_ (Roxburgh), a native of India beyond the Ganges; balm (Heb.\r\n  _tsori_), the oleo-resin of _Balsamodendron opobalsamum_ and _B.\r\n  gileadense_; bdellium (Heb. _bdolah_), the resin produced by\r\n  _Balsamodendron roxburghii_, _B. Mukul_ and _B. pubescens_, all\r\n  natives of Upper India (Lassen, however, identifies _bdolah_ with\r\n  musk); calamus (Heb. _kaneh_; sweet calamus, _keneh bosem_, Ex. xxx.\r\n  23; Ezek. xxvii. 19; sweet cane, _kaneh hattob_, Jer. vi. 20; Isa.\r\n  xliii. 24), identified by Royle with the _Andropogon Calamus\r\n  aromaticus_ or roosa grass of India; cassia (Heb. _kiddah_) the\r\n  _Cinnamomum Cassia_ of China; cinnamon (Heb. _kinnamon_), the\r\n  _Cinnamomum zeylanicum_ of the Somali country, but cultivated largely\r\n  in Ceylon, where also it runs wild, and in Java; costus (Heb.\r\n  _ketzioth_), the root of the _Aucklandia Costus_ (Falconer), native of\r\n  Kashmir; frankincense (Heb. _lebonah_), the gum-resin of _Bosiwellia\r\n  Frereana_ and _B. Bhau-Dajiana_ of the Somali country, and of _B.\r\n  Carterii_ of the Somali country and the opposite coast of Arabia (see\r\n  \"The Genus Boswellia\" by Sir George Birdwood, _Transactions of the\r\n  Linnean Society_, xxi. 1871); galbanum (Heb. _helbenah_), yielded by\r\n  _Opoidia galbanifera_ (Royle) of Khorassan, and _Galbanum officinale_\r\n  (Don) of Syria and other _Ferulas_; ladanum (Heb. _lot_, translated\r\n  \"myrrh\" in Gen. xxxvii. 25, xliii. 11), the resinous exudation of\r\n  _Cistus creticus_, _C. ladaniferus_ and other species of \"rock rose\"\r\n  or \"rose of Sharon\"; myrrh (Heb. _mor_), the gum-resin of the\r\n  _Balsamodendron Myrrha_ of the Somali country and opposite shore of\r\n  Arabia; onycha (Heb. _sheheleth_), the celebrated odoriferous shell of\r\n  the ancients, the operculum or \"nail\" of a species of _Strombus_ or\r\n  \"wing shell,\" formerly well known in Europe under the name of _Blatta\r\n  byzantina_; it is still imported into Bombay to burn with frankincense\r\n  and other incense to bring out their odours more strongly; saffron\r\n  (Heb. _karkom_), the stigmata of _Crocus sativus_, a native originally\r\n  of Kashmir; spikenard (Heb. _nerd_), the root of the _Nardostachys\r\n  Jatamansi_ of Nepal and Bhutan; stacte (Heb. _nataf_), generally\r\n  referred to the _Styrax officinalis_ of the Levant, but Hanbury has\r\n  shown that no stacte or storax is now derived from _S. officinalis_,\r\n  and that all that is found in modern commerce is the product of the\r\n  _Liquidambar orientalis_ of Cyprus and Anatolia.\r\n\r\n  Besides these aromatic substances named in the Bible, the following\r\n  must also be enumerated on account of their common use as incense in\r\n  the East; benzoin or gum benjamin, first mentioned among Western\r\n  writers by Ibn Batuta (1325-1349) under the name of _lubân d' Javi_\r\n  (i.e. olibanum of Java), corrupted in the parlance of Europe into\r\n  benjamin and benzoin; camphor, produced by _Cinnamomum Camphora_, the\r\n  \"camphor laurel\" of China and Japan, and by _Dryobalanops aromatica_,\r\n  a native of the Indian Archipelago, and widely used as incense\r\n  throughout the East, particularly in China; elemi, the resin of an\r\n  unknown tree of the Philippine Islands, the elemi of old writers being\r\n  the resin of _Boswellia Frereana_; gum-dragon or dragon's blood,\r\n  obtained from _Calamus Draco_, one of the ratan palms of the Indian\r\n  Archipelago, _Dracaena Draco_, a liliaceous plant of the Canary\r\n  Island, and _Pterocarpus Draco_, a leguminous tree of the island of\r\n  Socotra; rose-malloes, a corruption of the Javanese _rasamala_, or\r\n  liquid storax, the resinous exudation of _Liquidambar Altingia_, a\r\n  native of the Indian Archipelago (an American _Liquidambar_ also\r\n  produces a rose-malloes-like exudation); star anise, the starlike\r\n  fruit of the _Illicum anisatum_ of Yunan and south-western China,\r\n  burnt as incense in the temples of Japan; sweet flag, the root of\r\n  _Acorus Calamus_, the bach of the Hindus, much used for incense in\r\n  India. An aromatic earth, found on the coast of Cutch, is used as\r\n  incense in the temples of western India. The animal excreta, musk and\r\n  civet, also enter into the composition of modern European pastils and\r\n  _clous fumants_. Balsam of Tolu, produced by _Myroxylon toluiferum_, a\r\n  native of Venezuela and New Granada; balsam of Peru, derived from\r\n  _Myroxylon Pereirae_, a native of San Salvador in Central America;\r\n  Mexican and Brazilian elemi, produced by various species of _Icica_ or\r\n  \"incense trees,\" and the liquid exudation of an American species of\r\n  _Liquidambar_, are all used as incense in America. Hanbury quotes a\r\n  faculty granted by Pope Pius V. (August 2, 1571) to the bishops of the\r\n  West Indies permitting the substitution of balsam of Peru for the\r\n  balsam of the East in the preparation of the chrism to be used by the\r\n  Catholic Church in America. The _Sangre del drago_ of the Mexicans is\r\n  a resin resembling dragon's blood obtained from a euphorbiaceous tree,\r\n  _Croton Draco_.\r\n\r\nProbably nowhere can the actual historical progress from the primitive\r\nuse of animal sacrifices to the later refinement of burning incense be\r\nmore clearly traced than in the pages of the Old Testament, where no\r\nmention of the latter rite occurs before the period of the Mosaic\r\nlegislation; but in the monuments of ancient Egypt the authentic traces\r\nof the use of incense that still exist carry us back to a much earlier\r\ndate. From Meroe to Memphis the commonest subject carved or painted in\r\nthe interiors of the temples is that of some contemporary Phrah or\r\nPharaoh worshipping the presiding deity with oblations of gold and\r\nsilver vessels, rich vestments, gems, the firstlings of the flock and\r\nherd, cakes, fruits, flowers, wine, anointing oil and incense. Generally\r\nhe holds in one hand the censer, and with the other casts the pastils or\r\nosselets of incense into it: sometimes he offers incense in one hand and\r\nmakes the libation of wine with the other. One of the best known of\r\nthese representations is that carved on the memorial stone placed by\r\nTethmosis (Thothmes) IV. (1533 B.C.) on the breast of the Sphinx at\r\nGizeh.[4] The tablet represents Tethmosis before his guardian deity, the\r\nsun-god Rê, pouring a libation of wine on one side and offering incense\r\non the other. The ancient Egyptians used various substances as incense.\r\nThey worshipped Rê at sunrise with resin, at mid-day with myrrh and at\r\nsunset with an elaborate confection called _kuphi_, compounded of no\r\nfewer than sixteen ingredients, among which were honey, wine, raisins,\r\nresin, myrrh and sweet calamus. While it was being mixed, holy writings\r\nwere read to those engaged in the operation. According to Plutarch,\r\napart from its mystic virtues arising from the magical combination of 4\r\n× 4, its sweet odour had a benign physiological effect on those who\r\noffered it.[5] The censer used was a hemispherical cup or bowl of\r\nbronze, supported by a long handle, fashioned at one end like an open\r\nhand, in which the bowl was, as it were, held, while the other end\r\nwithin which the pastils of incense were kept was shaped into the hawk's\r\nhead crowned with a disk, as the symbol of Rê.[6] In embalming their\r\ndead the Egyptians filled the cavity of the belly with every sort of\r\nspicery except frankincense (Herod, ii. 86), for it was regarded as\r\nspecially consecrated to the worship of the gods. In the burnt-offerings\r\nof male kine to Isis, the carcase of the steer, after evisceration, was\r\nfilled with fine bread, honey, raisins, figs, frankincense, myrrh and\r\nother aromatics, and thus stuffed was roasted, being basted all the\r\nwhile by pouring over it large quantities of sweet oil, and then eaten\r\nwith great festivity.\r\n\r\nHow important the consumption of frankincense in the worship of the gods\r\nbecame in Egypt is shown by two of its monuments, both of the greatest\r\ninterest and value for the light they throw on the early history of the\r\ncommerce of the Indian Ocean. One is an inscription in the rocky valley\r\nof Hammamat, through which the desert road from the Red Sea to the\r\nvalley of Egypt opens on the green fields and palm groves of the river\r\nNile near Coptos. It was cut on the rocks by an Egyptian nobleman named\r\nHannu, who states that he was sent by Pharaoh Sankhkere, Menthotp IV.,\r\nwith a force gathered out of the Thebaid, from Coptos to the Red Sea,\r\nthere to take command of a naval expedition to the Holy Land of Punt\r\n(Puoni), \"to bring back odoriferous gums.\" Punt is identified with the\r\nSomali country, now known to be the native country of the trees that\r\nyield the bulk of the frankincense of commerce. The other bears the\r\nrecord of a second expedition to the same land of Punt, undertaken by\r\ncommand of Queen Hatshepsut, 1600 B.C. It is preserved in the vividly\r\nchiselled and richly coloured decorations portraying the history of the\r\nreign of this famous Pharaoh on the walls of the \"Stage Temple\" at\r\nThebes. The temple is now in ruins, but the entire series of gorgeous\r\npictures recording the expedition to \"the balsam land of Punt,\" from its\r\nleaving to its returning to Thebes, still remains intact and\r\nundefaced.[7] These are the only authenticated instances of the export\r\nof incense trees from the Somali country until Colonel Playfair, then\r\npolitical agent at Aden, in 1862-1864, collected and sent to Bombay the\r\nspecimens from which Sir George Birdwood prepared his descriptions of\r\nthem for the Linnean Society in 1868. King Antigonus is said to have had\r\na branch of the true frankincense tree sent to him.\r\n\r\nHomer tells us that the Egyptians of his time were emphatically a nation\r\nof druggists (_Od._ iv. 229, 230). This characteristic, in which, as in\r\nmany others, they so remarkably resemble the Hindus, the Egyptians have\r\nmaintained to the present day; and, although they have changed their\r\nreligion, the use of incense among them continues to be as familiar and\r\nformal as ever. The _kohl_ or black powder with which the modern, like\r\nthe ancient, Egyptian ladies paint their languishing eyelids, is nothing\r\nbut the smeeth of charred frankincense, or other odoriferous resin\r\nbrought with frankincense, and phials of water, from the well of\r\nZem-zem, by the pilgrims returning from Mecca. They also melt\r\nfrankincense as a depilatory, and smear their hands with a paste into\r\nthe composition of which frankincense enters, for the purpose of\r\ncommunicating to them an attractive perfume. Herodotus (iv. 75)\r\ndescribes a similar artifice as practised by the women of Scythia\r\n(compare also Judith x. 3, 4). In cold weather the Egyptians warm their\r\nrooms by placing in them a brazier, \"chafing-dish,\" or \"standing-dish,\"\r\nfilled with charcoal, whereon incense is burnt; and in hot weather they\r\nrefresh them by occasionally swinging a hand censer by a chain through\r\nthem--frankincense, benzoin and aloe wood being chiefly used for the\r\npurpose.[8]\r\n\r\nIn the authorized version of the Bible, the word \"incense\" translates\r\ntwo wholly distinct Hebrew words. In various passages in the latter\r\nportion of Isaiah (xl.-lxvi.), in Jeremiah and in Chronicles, it\r\nrepresents the Hebrew _lebonah_, more usually rendered \"frankincense\";\r\nelsewhere the original word is _ketoreth_ (Ex. xxx. 8, 9; Lev. x. 1;\r\nNum. vii. 14, &c.), a derivative of the verb _kitter_ (Pi.) or _hiktir_\r\n(Hiph.), which verb is used, not only in Ex. xxx. 7, but also in Lev. i.\r\n9, iii. 11, ix. 13, and many other passages, to denote the process by\r\nwhich the \"savour of satisfaction\" in any burnt-offering, whether of\r\nflesh or of incense, is produced. Sometimes in the authorized version\r\n(as in 1 Kings iii. 3; 1 Sam. ii. 28) it is made to mean explicitly the\r\nburning of incense with only doubtful propriety. The expression \"incense\r\n(_ketoreth_) of rains\" in Ps. lxvi. 15 and the allusion in Ps. cxli. 2\r\nought both to be understood, most probably, of ordinary\r\nburnt-offerings.[9] The \"incense\" (_ketoreth_), or \"incense of sweet\r\nscents\" (_ketoreth sammim_), called, in Ex. xxx. 35, \"a confection after\r\nthe art of the apothecary,\" or rather \"a perfume after the art of the\r\nperfumer,\" which was to be regarded as most holy, and the imitation of\r\nwhich was prohibited under the severest penalties, was compounded of\r\nfour \"sweet scents\" (_sammim_),[10] namely stacte (_nataph_), onycha\r\n(_sheheleth_), galbanum (_helbenah_) and \"pure\" or \"fine\" frankincense\r\n(_lebonah zaccah_), pounded together in equal proportions, with\r\n(perhaps) an admixture of salt (_memullah_).[11] It was then to be \"put\r\nbefore the testimony\" in the \"tent of meeting.\" It was burnt on the\r\naltar of incense by the priest every morning when the lamps were trimmed\r\nin the Holy Place, and every evening when they were lighted or \"set up\"\r\n(Ex. xxx. 7, 8). A handful of it was also burnt once a year in the Holy\r\nof Holies by the high priest on a pan of burning coals taken from the\r\naltar of burnt-offering (Lev. xvi. 12, 13). Pure frankincense\r\n(_lebonah_) formed part of the meat-offering (Lev. ii. 16, vi. 15), and\r\nwas also presented along with the shew bread (Lev. xxiv. 7) every\r\nSabbath day (probably on two golden saucers; see Jos. _Ant._ iii. 10,\r\n7). The religious significance of the use of incense, or at least of its\r\nuse in the Holy of Holies, is distinctly set forth in Lev. xvi. 12, 13.\r\n\r\nThe Jews were also in the habit of using odoriferous substances in\r\nconnexion with the funeral obsequies of distinguished persons (see 2\r\nChron. xvi. 14, xxi. 19; Jer. xxxiv. 5). In Amos vi. 10 \"he that burneth\r\nhim\" probably means \"he that burns perfumes in his honour.\" References\r\nto the domestic use of incense occur in Cant. iii. 6; Prov. xxvii. 9;\r\ncf. vii. 17.\r\n\r\nThe \"marbles\" of Nineveh furnish frequent examples of the offering of\r\nincense to the sun-god and his consort (2 Kings xxiii. 5). The kings of\r\nAssyria united in themselves the royal and priestly offices, and on the\r\nmonuments they erected they are generally represented as offering\r\nincense and pouring out wine to the Tree of Life. They probably carried\r\nthe incense in the sacred bag so frequently seen in their hands and in\r\nthose also of the common priests. According to Herodotus (i. 183),\r\nfrankincense to the amount of 1000 talents' weight was offered every\r\nyear, during the feast of Bel, on the great altar of his temple in\r\nBabylon.\r\n\r\nThe monuments of Persepolis and the coins of the Sassanians show that\r\nthe religious use of incense was as common in ancient Persia as in\r\nBabylonia and Assyria. Five times a day the priests of the Persians\r\n(Zoroastrians) burnt incense on their sacred fire altars. In the Avesta\r\n(_Vendidad_, Fargard xix. 24, 40), the incense they used is named _vohu\r\ngaono_. It has been identified with benzoin, but was probably\r\nfrankincense. Herodotus (iii. 97) states that the Arabs brought every\r\nyear to Darius as tribute 1000 talents of frankincense. The Parsees\r\nstill preserve in western India the pure tradition of the ritual of\r\nincense as followed by their race from probably the most ancient times.\r\n\r\nThe _Ramayana_ and _Mahabharata_ afford evidence of the employment of\r\nincense by the Hindus, in the worship of the gods and the burning of the\r\ndead, from the remotest antiquity. Its use was obviously continued by\r\nthe Buddhists during the prevalence of their religion in India, for it\r\nis still used by them in Nepal, Tibet, Ceylon, Burma, China and Japan.\r\nThese countries all received Buddhism from India, and a large proportion\r\nof the porcelain and earthenware articles imported from China and Japan\r\ninto Europe consists of innumerable forms of censers. The Jains all over\r\nIndia burn sticks of incense before their Jina. The commonest incense in\r\nancient India was probably frankincense. The Indian frankincense tree,\r\n_Boswellia thurifera_, Colebrooke (which certainly includes _B. glabra_,\r\nRoxburgh), is a doubtful native of India. It is found chiefly where the\r\nBuddhist religion prevailed in ancient times, in Bihar and along the\r\nfoot of the Himalayas and in western India, where it particularly\r\nflourishes in the neighbourhood of the Buddhist caves at Ajanta. It is\r\nquite possible therefore that, in the course of their widely extended\r\ncommerce during the one thousand years of their ascendancy, the\r\nBuddhists imported the true frankincense trees from Africa and Arabia\r\ninto India, and that the accepted Indian species are merely varieties of\r\nthem. Now, however, the incense in commonest use in India is benzoin.\r\nBut the consumption of all manner of odoriferous resins, gum resins,\r\nroots, woods, dried leaves, flowers, fruits and seeds in India, in\r\nsocial as well as religious observances, is enormous. The grateful\r\nperfumed powder _abir_ or _randa_ is composed either of rice, flour,\r\nmango bark or deodar wood, camphor and aniseed, or of sandalwood or wood\r\naloes, and zerumbet, zedoary, rose flowers, camphor and civet. The\r\nincense sticks and pastils known all over India under the names of\r\n_ud-buti_ (\"benzoin-light\") or _aggar-ki-buti_ (\"wood aloes light\") are\r\ncomposed of benzoin, wood aloes, sandalwood, rock lichen, patchouli,\r\nrose-malloes, _talispat_ (the leaf of _Flacourtia Cataphracta_ of\r\nRoxburgh), mastic and sugar-candy or gum. The _abir_ and _aggir butis_\r\nmade at the Mahommedan city of Bijapur in the Mahratta country are\r\ncelebrated all over western India. The Indian Mussulmans indeed were\r\nrapidly degenerating into a mere sect of Hindus before the Wahabi\r\nrevival, and the more recent political propaganda in support of the\r\nfalse caliphate of the sultans of Turkey; and we therefore find the\r\nreligious use of incense among them more general than among the\r\nMahommedans of any other country. They use it at the ceremonies of\r\ncircumcision, _bismillah_ (teaching the child \"the name of God\"),\r\nvirginity and marriage. At marriage they burn benzoin with _nim_ seeds\r\n(_Melia Azadirachta_, Roxburgh) to keep off evil spirits, and prepare\r\nthe bride-cakes by putting a quantity of benzoin between layers of\r\nwheaten dough, closed all round, and frying them in clarified butter.\r\nFor days the bride is fed on little else. In their funeral ceremonies,\r\nthe moment the spirit has fled incense is burnt before the corpse until\r\nit is carried out to be buried. The begging fakirs also go about with a\r\nlighted stick of incense in one hand, and holding out with the other an\r\nincense-holder (literally, \"incense chariot\"), into which the coins of\r\nthe pious are thrown. Large \"incense trees\" resembling our Christmas\r\ntrees, formed of incense-sticks and pastils and osselets, and alight all\r\nover, are borne by the Shiah Mussulmans in the solennial procession of\r\nthe Mohurrum, in commemoration of the martyrdom of the sons of Ali. The\r\nworship of the _tulsi_ plant, or holy basil (_Ocymum sanctum_, Don), by\r\nthe Hindus is popularly explained by its consecration to Vishnu and\r\nKrishna. It grows on the four-horned altar before the house, or in a pot\r\nplaced in one of the front windows, and is worshipped every morning by\r\nall the female members of every Hindu household. It is possible that its\r\nadoration has survived from the times when the Hindus buried their dead\r\nin their houses, beneath the family hearth. When they came into a hot\r\nclimate the fire of the sacrifices and domestic cookery was removed out\r\nof the house; but the dead were probably still for a while buried in or\r\nnear it, and the _tulsi_ was planted over their graves, at once for the\r\nsalubrious fragrance it diffuses and to represent the burning of incense\r\non the altar of the family Lar. The rich land round about the holy city\r\nof Pandharpur, sacred to Vithoba the national Mahratta form of\r\n(Krishna)-Vishnu, is wholly restricted to the cultivation of the tulsi\r\nplant.\r\n\r\nAs to the [Greek: thyea] mentioned in Homer (_Il._ ix. 499, and\r\nelsewhere) and in Hesiod (_Works and Days_, 338), there is some\r\nuncertainty whether they were incense offerings at all, and if so,\r\nwhether they were ever offered alone, and not always in conjunction with\r\nanimal sacrifices. That the domestic use, however, of the fragrant wood\r\n[Greek: thyon] (the _Arbor vitae_ or _Cailitris quadrivalvis_ of\r\nbotanists, the source of the resin sandarach) was known in the Homeric\r\nage, is shown by the case of Calypso (_Od._ v. 60), and the very\r\nsimilarity of the word [Greek: thyon] to [Greek: thyos] may be taken as\r\nalmost conclusively proving that by that time the same wood was also\r\nemployed for religious purposes. It is not probable that the\r\nsweet-smelling gums and resins of the countries of the Indian Ocean\r\nbegan to be introduced into Greece before the 8th or 7th century B.C.,\r\nand doubtless [Greek: libanos] or [Greek: libanôtos] first became an\r\narticle of extensive commerce only after the Mediterranean trade with\r\nthe East had been opened up by the Egyptian king Psammetichus (c.\r\n664-610 B.C.). The new Oriental word is frequently employed by\r\nHerodotus; and there are abundant references to the use of the thing\r\namong the writers of the golden age of Attic literature (see, for\r\nexample, Aristophanes, _Plut._ 1114; _Frogs_, 871, 888; _Clouds_, 426;\r\n_Wasps_, 96, 861). Frankincense, however, though the most common, never\r\nbecame the only kind of incense offered to the gods among the Greeks.\r\nThus the Orphic hymns are careful to specify, in connexion with the\r\nseveral deities celebrated, a great variety of substances appropriate to\r\nthe service of each; in the case of many of these the selection seems to\r\nhave been determined not at all by their fragrance but by some occult\r\nconsiderations which it is now difficult to divine.\r\n\r\nAmong the Romans the use of religious fumigations long preceded the\r\nintroduction of foreign substances for the purpose (see, for example,\r\nOvid, _Fast._ i. 337 seq., \"Et non exiguo laurus adusta sono\"). Latterly\r\nthe use of frankincense (\"mascula thura,\" Virg. _Ecl._ viii. 65) became\r\nvery prevalent, not only in religious ceremonials, but also on various\r\nstate occasions, such as in triumphs (Ovid, _Trist_, iv. 2, 4), and also\r\nin connexion with certain occurrences of domestic life. In private it\r\nwas daily offered by the devout to the _Lar familiaris_ (Plaut. _Aulul._\r\nprol. 23); and in public sacrifices it was not only sprinkled on the\r\nhead of the victim by the pontifex before its slaughter, and afterwards\r\nmingled with its blood, but was also thrown upon the flames over which\r\nit was roasted.\r\n\r\nNo perfectly satisfactory traces can be found of the use of incense in\r\nthe ritual of the Christian Church during the first four centuries.[12]\r\nIt obviously was not contemplated by the author of the epistle to the\r\nHebrews; its use was foreign to the synagogue services on which, and not\r\non those of the temple, the worship of the primitive Christians is well\r\nknown to have been originally modelled; and its associations with\r\nheathen solemnities, and with the evil repute of those who were known as\r\n\"thurificati,\" would still further militate against its employment.\r\nVarious authors of the ante-Nicene period have expressed themselves as\r\ndistinctly unfavourable to its religious, though not of course to its\r\ndomestic, use. Thus Tertullian, while (_De Cor. Mil._ 10) ready to\r\nacknowledge its utility in counteracting unpleasant smells (\"si me odor\r\nalicujus loci offenderit, Arabiae aliquid incendo\"), is careful to say\r\nthat he scorns to offer it as an accompaniment to his heartfelt prayers\r\n(_Apol._ 30; cf. 42). Athenagoras also (_Legat._ 13) gives distinct\r\nexpression to his sense of the needlessness of any such ritual (\"the\r\nCreator and Father of the universe does not require blood, nor smoke,\r\nnor even the sweet smell of flowers and incense\"); and Arnobius (_Adv.\r\nGent._ vii. 26) seeks to justify the Christian neglect of it by the\r\nfact, for which he vouches, that among the Romans themselves incense was\r\nunknown in the time of Numa, while the Etruscans had always continued to\r\nbe strangers to it. Cyril of Jerusalem, Augustine and the Apostolic\r\nConstitutions make no reference to any such feature either in the public\r\nor private worship of the Christians of that time. The earliest mention,\r\nit would seem, occurs in the Apostolic Canons (can. 3), where the\r\n[Greek: thymiama] is spoken of as one of the requisites of the\r\neucharistic service. It is easy to perceive how it should inevitably\r\nhave come in along with the whole circle of ideas involved in such words\r\nas \"temple,\" \"altar,\" \"priest,\" which about this time came to be so\r\ngenerally applied in ecclesiastical connexions. Evagrius (vi. 21)\r\nmentions the gift of a [Greek: thymiatêrion] by the contemporary\r\nChosroes of Persia to the church of Jerusalem; and all the Oriental\r\nliturgies of this period provide special prayers for the thurification\r\nof the eucharistic elements. The oldest _Ordo Romanus_, which perhaps\r\ntakes us back to within a century of Gregory the Great, enjoins that in\r\npontifical masses a sub-deacon, with a golden censer, shall go before\r\nthe bishop as he leaves the secretarium for the choir, and two, with\r\ncensers, before the deacon gospeller as he proceeds with the gospel to\r\nthe ambo. And less than two centuries afterwards we read an order in one\r\nof the capitularies of Hincmar of Reims, to the effect that every priest\r\nought to be provided with a censer and incense. That in this portion of\r\ntheir ritual, however, the Christians of that period were not\r\nuniversally conscious of its direct descent from Mosaic institutions may\r\nbe inferred perhaps from the \"benediction of the incense\" used in the\r\ndays of Charlemagne, which runs as follows: \"May the Lord bless this\r\nincense to the extinction of every noxious smell, and kindle it to the\r\nodour of its sweetness.\" Even Thomas Aquinas (p. iii. qu. 83, art. 5)\r\ngives prominence to this idea.\r\n\r\nThe character and order of these historical notices of incense would\r\ncertainly, were there nothing else to be considered, justify the\r\nconclusion hitherto generally adopted, that its use was wholly unknown\r\nin the worship of the Christian Church before the 5th century. On the\r\nother hand, we know that in the first Christian services held in the\r\ncatacombs under the city of Rome, incense was burnt as a sanitary\r\nfumigation at least. Tertullian also distinctly alludes to the use of\r\naromatics in Christian burial: \"the Sabaeans will testify that more of\r\ntheir merchandise, and that more costly, is lavished on the burial of\r\nChristians, than in burning incense to the gods.\" And the whole argument\r\nfrom analogy is in favour of the presumption of the ceremonial use of\r\nincense by the Christians from the first. It is natural that little\r\nshould be said of so obvious a practice until the fuller development of\r\nritual in a later age. The slighting references to it by the Christian\r\nfathers are no more an argument against its existence in the primitive\r\nchurch than the similar denunciations by the Jewish prophets of\r\nburnt-offerings and sacrifices are any proof that there were no such\r\nrites as the offering of incense, and of the blood of bulls and fat of\r\nrams, in the worship of the temple at Jerusalem. There could be no real\r\noffence to Christians in the burning of incense. Malachi (i. 11) had\r\nalready foretold the time when among the Gentiles, in every place,\r\nincense should be offered to God. Gold, with myrrh and frankincense were\r\noffered by the Persian Magi to the infant Jesus at his birth; and in\r\nRevelation viii. 3, 4, the image of the offering of incense with the\r\nprayers of the saints, before the throne of God, is not without its\r\nsignificance. If also the passage in Ambrose of Milan (on Luke i. 11),\r\nwhere he speaks of \"us\" as \"adolentes altaria\" is to be translated\r\n\"incensing the altars,\" and taken literally, it is a testimony to the\r\nuse of incense by the Christian Church in, at least, the 4th century.\r\nBut the earliest express mention of the censing of the altar by\r\nChristian priests is in \"the works,\" first quoted in the 6th century,\r\nattributed to \"Dionysius the Areopagite,\" the contemporary of St Paul\r\n(Acts xvii. 34).\r\n\r\nThe Missal of the Roman Church now enjoins incensation before the\r\nintroit, at the gospel and again at the offertory, and at the elevation,\r\nin every high mass; the use of incense also occurs at the exposition of\r\nthe sacrament, at consecrations of churches and the like, in\r\nprocessions, in the office for the burial of the dead and at the\r\nexhibition of relics. On high festivals the altar is censed at vespers\r\nand lauds.\r\n\r\nIn the Church of England the use of incense was gradually abandoned\r\nafter the reign of Edward VI., until the ritualistic revival of the\r\npresent day. Its use, however, has never been abolished by law. A \"Form\r\nfor the Consecration of a Censer\" occurs in Sancroft's _Form of\r\nDedication and Consecration of a Church or Chapel_ (1685). In various\r\nworks of reference (as, for example, in _Notes and Queries_, 3rd ser.\r\nvol. viii. p. 11) numerous sporadic cases are mentioned in which incense\r\nappears to have been burnt in churches; the evidence, however, does not\r\ngo so far as to show that it was used during divine service, least of\r\nall that it was used during the communion office. At the coronation of\r\nGeorge III., one of the king's grooms appeared \"in a scarlet dress,\r\nholding a perfuming pan, burning perfumes, as at previous coronations.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1899, on the appeal of the Rev. H. Westall, St Cuthbert's, London,\r\nand the Rev. E. Ram, St John's, Norwich, against the use of incense in\r\nthe Church of England, the archbishops of Canterbury (Dr Temple) and\r\nYork (Dr Maclagan) supported the appeal. Their decision was reviewed by\r\nChancellor L. T. Dibdin in the 10th edition of the _Encyclopaedia\r\nBritannica_, and the exposition given by Sir Lewis Dibdin of the whole\r\nquestion of the use of incense in the Church of England may here be\r\ninterpolated.     (G. B.)\r\n\r\n_Incense in the Church of England._--Mr Scudamore (_Notitia\r\nEucharistica_, 2nd ed. pp. 141-142) thus describes the method and extent\r\nof the employment of incense at the mass prior to the Reformation:--\r\n\r\n  \"According to the use of Sarum (and Bangor) the priest, after being\r\n  himself censed by the deacon, censed the altar before the Introit\r\n  began. The York rubric directed him to do it immediately alter the\r\n  first saying of the Introit, which in England was thrice said. The\r\n  Hereford missal gives no direction for censing the altar at that time.\r\n  The middle of the altar was censed, according to Sarum, Bangor and\r\n  Hereford, before the reading of the Gospel. According to Sarum and\r\n  Bangor, the thurible, as well as the lights, attended the Gospel to\r\n  the lectern. Perhaps the York rubric implies that this was done when\r\n  it orders (which the others do not) the thurible to be carried round\r\n  the choir with the Gospel while the Creed was being sung. In the Sarum\r\n  and Bangor, the priest censed the oblations after offering them; then\r\n  the space between himself and the altar. He was then, at Sarum, censed\r\n  by the deacon, and an acolyte censed the choir; at Bangor the\r\n  _Sinistrum Cornu_ of the altar and the relics were censed instead.\r\n  York and Hereford ordered no censing at the offertory. There is reason\r\n  to think that, notwithstanding the order for the use of incense at\r\n  every celebration, it was in practice burnt only on high festivals,\r\n  and then only in rich churches, down to the period of the Reformation.\r\n  In most parishes its costliness alone would preclude its daily use,\r\n  while the want of an assistant minister would be a very common reason\r\n  for omitting the rite almost everywhere. Incense was not burnt in\r\n  private masses, so that the clergy were accustomed to celebrations\r\n  without it, and would naturally forego it on any plausible ground.\"\r\n\r\nThe ritual of the mass remained unchanged until the death of Henry VIII.\r\n(Jan. 28, 1547). In March 1548 the _Order of the Communion_ was\r\npublished and commanded to be used by royal proclamation in the name of\r\nEdward VI. It was the precursor of the Prayer Book, and supplemented the\r\naccustomed Latin service by additions in English to provide for the\r\ncommunion of the people in both kinds. But it was expressly stated in a\r\nrubric that the old service of the mass was to proceed without variation\r\nof any rite or ceremony until after the priest had received the\r\nsacrament, that is, until long after the last of the three occasions for\r\nthe use of incense explained above. But on Whitsunday 1549 the first\r\nPrayer Book of Edward VI. came into use under an Act of Parliament (2\r\nand 3 Ed. VI. ch. 1, the first Act of Uniformity) which required its\r\nexclusive use in public worship so as to supersede all other forms of\r\nservice. Another Act, 3 and 4 Ed. VI. ch. 10, required the old service\r\nbooks to be delivered up to be destroyed. The first Prayer Book does not\r\ncontain any direction to use or any mention of incense. It has been and\r\nstill is a keenly controverted question whether incense did or did not\r\ncontinue to be in ceremonial use under the first Prayer Book or during\r\nthe rest of Edward VI.'s reign. No evidence has hitherto been discovered\r\nwhich justifies us in answering this question in the affirmative. The\r\nsecond Prayer Book of Edward VI. (1552), published under the authority\r\nof the second Act of Uniformity (5 and 6 Ed. VI. ch. 1), contains no\r\nreference to incense. Edward VI. died on the 6th July 1553. Queen Mary\r\nby statute (1 Mary, sess. 2, ch. 2) abolished the Prayer Book, repealed\r\nthe Acts of Uniformity and restored \"divine service and administration\r\nof sacraments as were most commonly used in England in the last year of\r\nHenry VIII.\" The ceremonial use of incense thus became again an\r\nundoubted part of the communion service in the Church of England. A\r\nproclamation issued (December 6, 1553) directed the churchwardens to\r\nobtain the proper ornaments for the churches; and the bishops (at any\r\nrate Bishop Bonner, see _Visitation Articles 1554_, Cardwell's _Doc.\r\nAnn._ i. 149-153) in their visitations inquired whether censers had been\r\nfurnished for use. Mary died on the 17th of November 1558. On the 24th\r\nof June 1559 the second Prayer Book of Edward VI. (with a few\r\nalterations having no reference to incense) was again established, under\r\nthe authority of the third Act of Uniformity (1 Eliz. ch. 2), as the\r\nexclusive service book for public service. There is no evidence of the\r\nceremonial use of incense under Elizabeth's Prayer Book, or under the\r\npresent Prayer Book of 1662 (established by the fourth Act of\r\nUniformity, 13 and 14 Charles II. ch. 4) until the middle of the 19th\r\ncentury; and there is no doubt that as a ceremony of divine worship,\r\nwhether at the Holy Communion or at other services, it was entirely\r\ndisused. There are, however, a good many instances recorded of what has\r\nbeen called a fumigatory use of frankincense in churches, by which it\r\nwas sought to purify the air, in times of public sickness, or to dispel\r\nthe foulness caused by large congregations, or poisonous gases arising\r\nfrom ill-constructed vaults under the church floor. It seems also to\r\nhave been used for the purpose of creating an agreeable perfume on great\r\noccasions, e.g. the great ecclesiastical feasts. But this use of incense\r\nmust be carefully distinguished from its ceremonial use. It was\r\nutilitarian and not symbolical, and from the nature of the purpose in\r\nview must have taken place before, rather than during, service. Of the\r\nsame character is the use of incense carried in a perfuming pan before\r\nthe sovereign at his coronation in the procession from Westminster Hall\r\nto the Abbey. This observance was maintained from James II.'s coronation\r\nto that of George III. In the general revival of church ceremonial which\r\naccompanied and followed the Oxford Movement incense was not forgotten,\r\nand its ceremonial use in the pre-Reformation method has been adopted in\r\na few extreme churches since 1850. Its use has been condemned as an\r\nillegal ceremony by the ecclesiastical courts. In 1868 Sir Robert\r\nPhillimore (Dean of the Arches) pronounced the ceremonial use of incense\r\nto be illegal in the suit of _Martin_ v. _Mackonochie_ (2 A. and E.L.R.\r\n116). The case was carried to the Privy Council on appeal, but there was\r\nno appeal on the question of incense. Again, in 1870, the ceremonial use\r\nof incense was condemned by Sir Robert Phillimore in the suit of\r\n_Sumner_ v. _Wix_ (3 A. and E.L.R. 58).\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these decisions, it was insisted by those who defended\r\nthe revival of the ceremonial use of incense that it was a legal custom\r\nof the Church of England. The question was once more elaborately argued\r\nin May 1899 before an informal tribunal consisting of the archbishop of\r\nCanterbury (Dr. Temple) and the archbishop of York (Dr. Maclagan), at\r\nLambeth Palace. On the 31st of July 1899 the archbishops decided that\r\nthe liturgical use of incense was illegal. The Lambeth \"opinion,\" as it\r\nwas called, failed to convince the clergy against whom it was directed\r\nany better than the judgments of the ecclesiastical courts, but at first\r\na considerable degree of obedience to the archbishops' view was shown.\r\nVarious expedients were adopted, as, e.g., the use of incense just\r\nbefore the beginning of service, by which it was sought to retain\r\nincense without infringing the law as laid down by the archbishops.\r\nThere remained, nevertheless, a tendency on the part of the clergy who\r\nused incense, or desired to do so, to revert to the position they\r\noccupied before the Lambeth hearing--that is, to insist on the\r\nceremonial use of incense as a part of the Catholic practice of the\r\nChurch of England which it is the duty of the clergy to maintain,\r\nnotwithstanding the decisions of ecclesiastical judges or the opinions\r\nor archbishops to the contrary.     (L. T. D.)\r\n\r\n_Manufacture._--For the manufacture of the incense now used in the\r\nChristian churches of Europe there is no fixed rule. The books of ritual\r\nare agreed that Ex. xxx. 34 should be taken as a guide as much as\r\npossible. It is recommended that frankincense should enter as largely as\r\npossible into its composition, and that if inferior materials be\r\nemployed at all they should not be allowed to preponderate. In Rome\r\nolibanum alone is employed; in other places benzoin, storax, lign,\r\naloes, cascarilla bark, cinnamon, cloves and musk are all said to be\r\noccasionally used. In the Russian Church, benzoin is chiefly employed.\r\nThe Armenian liturgy, in its benediction of the incense, speaks of \"this\r\nperfume prepared from myrrh and cinnamon.\"\r\n\r\nThe preparation of pastils of incense has probably come down in a\r\ncontinuous tradition from ancient Egypt, Babylonia and Phoenicia. Cyprus\r\nwas for centuries famous for their manufacture, and they were still\r\nknown in the middle ages by the names of pastils or osselets of Cyprus.\r\n\r\nMaimonides, in his _More Nevochim_, states that the use of incense in\r\nthe worship of the Jews originated as a corrective of the disagreeable\r\nodours arising from the slaughter and burning of the animals offered in\r\nsacrifice. There can be no doubt that its use throughout the East is\r\nbased on sanitary considerations; and in Europe even, in the time when\r\nthe dead were buried in the churches, it was recognized that the burning\r\nof incense served essentially to preserve their salubrity. But evidently\r\nthe idea that the odour of a burnt-offering (cf. the [Greek: knisês\r\nhêdys autmê] of _Odyss._ xii. 369) is grateful to the deity, being\r\nindeed the most essential part of the sacrifice, or at least the vehicle\r\nby which alone it can successfully be conveyed to its destination, is\r\nalso a very early one, if not absolutely primitive; and survivals of it\r\nare possibly to be met with even among the most highly cultured peoples\r\nwhere the purely symbolical nature of all religious ritual is most\r\nclearly understood and maintained. Some such idea plainly underlies the\r\nfamiliar phrase \"a sweet savour,\" more literally \"a savour of\r\nsatisfaction,\" whereby an acceptable offering by fire is so often\r\ndenoted in the Bible (Gen. viii. 21; Lev. i. 9, _et passim_; cf. Eph. v.\r\n2). It is easy to imagine how, as men grew in sensuous appreciation of\r\npleasant perfumes, and in empirical knowledge of the sources from which\r\nthese could be derived, this advance would naturally express itself, not\r\nonly in their domestic habits, but also in the details of their\r\nreligious ceremonial, so that the custom of adding some kind of incense\r\nto their animal sacrifices, and at length that of offering it pure and\r\nsimple, would inevitably arise. Ultimately, with the development of the\r\nspiritual discernment of men, the \"offering of incense\" became a mere\r\nsymbolical phrase for prayer (see Rev. v. 8, viii. 3, 4). Clement of\r\nAlexandria expresses this in his well-known words: \"The true altar of\r\nincense is the just soul, and the perfume from it is holy prayer.\" (So\r\nalso Origen, _Cont. Cels._ viii. 17, 20.) The ancients were familiar\r\nwith the sanitary efficacy of fumigations. The energy with which\r\nUlysses, after the slaughter of the suitors, calls to Euryclea for \"fire\r\nand sulphur\" to purge (literally \"fumigate\") the dining-hall from the\r\npollution of their blood (_Od._ xxii. 481, 482) would startle those who\r\nimagine that sanitation is a peculiarly modern science. There is not the\r\nslightest doubt that the censing of things and persons was first\r\npractised as an act of purification, and thus became symbolical of\r\nconsecration, and finally of the sanctification of the soul. The\r\nEgyptians understood the use of incense as symbolical of the\r\npurification of the soul by prayer. Catholic writers generally treat it\r\nas typifying contrition, the preaching of the Gospel, the prayers of the\r\nfaithful and the virtues of the saints.     (G.

The\r\n    Latino-barbaric word _Olibanum_ (quasi _Oleum Libani_), the common\r\n    name for frankincense in modern commerce, is used in a bull of Pope\r\n    Benedict IX. (1033).

Compare Duchesne,\r\n    _Christian Worship_ (Eng. trans., 1904), ch. ii., \"The Mass in the\r\n    East,\" v. \"The Books of the Latin Rite,\" and xii. \"The Dedication of\r\n    Churches.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINCEST (Lat. _incestus_, unchaste), sexual intercourse between persons\r\nso related by kindred or affinity that legal marriage cannot take place\r\nbetween them (see MARRIAGE, especially the section _Canon Law_). In\r\nEngland incest formerly was not generally treated as a crime, although,\r\nalong with other offences against morals, it was made punishable by\r\ndeath in 1650. Since the Restoration it had, to use Blackstone's phrase,\r\nbeen left to the \"feeble coercion of the spiritual courts,\" but bills to\r\nmake it a criminal offence have at various times been unsuccessfully\r\nintroduced in Parliament. In 1908 however, an act (The Punishment of\r\nIncest Act 1908) was passed, under which sexual intercourse of a male\r\nwith his grand-daughter, daughter, sister or mother is made punishable\r\nwith penal servitude for not less than 3 or more than 7 years, or with\r\nimprisonment for not more than two years with or without hard labour. It\r\nis immaterial that the sexual intercourse was had with the consent of\r\nthe female; indeed, by s. 2 a female who consents is on conviction\r\nliable to the same punishment as the male. The act also makes an attempt\r\nto commit the offence of incest a misdemeanour, punishable by\r\nimprisonment for not more than two years with or without hard labour.\r\nThe terms \"brother\" and \"sister\" include half-brother and half-sister,\r\nwhether the relationship is or is not traced through lawful wedlock. All\r\nproceedings under the act are held _in camera_ (s. 5). The act does not\r\napply to Scotland, incest being punishable in Scots law. Under the\r\nMatrimonial Causes Act 1857, s. 27, incestuous adultery is _per se_\r\nsufficient ground to entitle a wife to divorce her husband. The Deceased\r\nWife's Sister's Marriage Act 1907, s. 3, retained wives' sisters in the\r\nclass of persons with whom adultery is incestuous. In the law of\r\nScotland, it was, until the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1887, a\r\ncrime nominally punishable with death, but the penalty usually inflicted\r\nwas penal servitude for life. This sentence was actually pronounced on a\r\nman in 1855. In the United States incest is not an indictable offence at\r\ncommon law, but, generally speaking, it has been made punishable by fine\r\nand imprisonment by state legislation. It is also a punishable offence\r\nin some European countries, notably Germany, Austria and Italy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINCH (O.

Her father died when she was\r\neight years old. She and her sisters never enjoyed the advantages of\r\nschool or of any regular supervision in their studies, but they seem to\r\nhave acquired refined and literary tastes at an early age. Ambitious to\r\nbecome an actress, a career for which an impediment in her speech hardly\r\nseemed to qualify her, she applied in vain for an engagement; and\r\nfinally, in 1772, she abruptly left home to seek her fortune in London.\r\nHere she married Joseph Inchbald (d. 1779), an actor, and on the 4th of\r\nSeptember made her début in Bristol as Cordelia, to his Lear. For\r\nseveral years she continued to act with him in the provinces. Her rôles\r\nincluded Anne Boleyn, Jane Shore, Calista, Calpurnia, Lady Anne in\r\n_Richard III._, Lady Percy, Lady Elizabeth Grey, Fanny in _The\r\nClandestine Marriage_, Desdemona, Aspasia in _Tamerlane_, Juliet and\r\nImogen; but notwithstanding her great beauty and her natural aptitude\r\nfor acting, her inability to acquire rapid and easy utterance prevented\r\nher from attaining to more than very moderate success. After the death\r\nof her husband she continued for some time on the stage; making her\r\nfirst London appearance at Covent Garden as Bellario in _Philaster_ on\r\nthe 3rd of October 1780. Her success, however, as an author led her to\r\nretire in 1789. She died at Kensington House on the 1st of August 1821.\r\n\r\nMrs. Inchbald wrote or adapted nineteen plays, and some of them,\r\nespecially _Wives as They Were and Maids as They Are_ (1797), were for a\r\ntime very successful. Among the others may be mentioned _I'll tell you\r\nWhat_ (translated into German, Leipzig, 1798); _Such Things Are_ (1788);\r\n_The Married Man_; _The Wedding Day_; _The Midnight Hour_; _Everyone has\r\nhis Fault_; and _Lover's Vows_. She also edited a collection of the\r\n_British Theatre_, with biographical and critical remarks (25 vols.,\r\n1806-1809); a _Collection of Farces_ (7 vols., 1809); and _The Modern\r\nTheatre_ (10 vols., 1809). Her fame, however, rests chiefly on her two\r\nnovels: _A Simple Story_ (1791), and _Nature and Art_ (1796). These\r\nworks possess many minor faults and inaccuracies, but on the whole their\r\nstyle is easy, natural and graceful; and if they are tainted in some\r\ndegree by a morbid and exaggerated sentiment, and display none of that\r\nfaculty of creation possessed by the best writers of fiction, the\r\npathetic situations, and the deep and pure feeling pervading them,\r\nsecured for them a wide popularity.\r\n\r\n  Mrs Inchbald destroyed an autobiography for which she had been offered\r\n  £1000 by Phillips the publisher; but her _Memoirs_, compiled by J.\r\n  Boaden, chiefly from her private journal, appeared in 1833 in two\r\n  volumes. An interesting account of Mrs Inchbald is contained in\r\n  _Records of a Girlhood_, by Frances Ann Kemble (1878). Her portrait\r\n  was painted by Sir Thomas Lawrence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINCHIQUIN, MURROUGH O'BRIEN, 1ST EARL OF (c. 1614-1674), Irish soldier\r\nand statesman, was the son of Dermod O'Brien, 5th Baron Inchiquin (d.\r\n1624). He belonged to a great family which traced its descent to Brian\r\nBoroimhe, king of Ireland, and members of which were always to the\r\nforefront in Irish public life. The first baron of Inchiquin was another\r\nMurrough O'Brien (d. 1551) who, after having made his submission to\r\nHenry VIII., was created baron of Inchiquin and earl of Thomond in 1543.\r\nWhen Murrough died in November 1551 by a curious arrangement his earldom\r\npassed to his nephew Donogh, son of Conor O'Brien (d. 1539), the last\r\nindependent prince of Thomond (see Thomond, Earls of), leaving only his\r\nbarony to be inherited by his son Dermod (d. 1557), the ancestor of the\r\nlater barons of Inchiquin.\r\n\r\nMurrough O'Brien, who became 6th baron of Inchiquin in 1624, gained some\r\nmilitary experience in Italy, and then in 1640 was appointed\r\nvice-president of Munster. He took an active and leading part in\r\nsuppressing the great Irish rebellion which broke out in the following\r\nyear, and during the Civil War the English parliament made him president\r\nof Munster. Early in 1648, however, he declared, for his former master\r\nCharles I., and for about two years he sought to uphold the royalist\r\ncause in Ireland. In 1654 Charles II. made him an earl. His later years\r\nwere partly spent in France and in Spain, but he had returned to Ireland\r\nwhen he died on the 9th of September 1674.\r\n\r\nHis son William, the 2nd earl (c. 1638-1692), served under his father in\r\nFrance and Spain, and for six years was governor of Tangier. He was a\r\npartisan of William III. in Ireland, and in 1690 he became governor of\r\nJamaica where he died in January 1692. In 1800 his descendant Murrough,\r\nthe 5th earl (d. 1808), was created marquess of Thomond, but on the\r\ndeath of James, the 3rd marquess, in July 1855 both the marquessate and\r\nthe earldom became extinct. The barony of Inchiquin, however, passed to\r\na kinsman, Sir Lucius O'Brien, Bart. (1800-1872), a descendant of the\r\nfirst baron and a brother of William Smith O'Brien (q.v.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINCLEDON, CHARLES BENJAMIN (1763-1826), English singer, son of a doctor\r\nin Cornwall, began as a choir-boy at Exeter, but then went into the\r\nnavy. His fine tenor voice, however, attracted general attention, and\r\nin 1783 he determined to seek his fortune on the stage. After various\r\nprovincial appearances he made a great success in 1790 at Covent Garden,\r\nand thenceforth was the principal English tenor of his day. He sang both\r\nin opera and in oratorio, but his chief popularity lay in his delivery\r\nof ballads, such as \"Sally in our Alley,\" \"Black-eyed Susan,\" \"The\r\nArethusa,\" and anything of a bold and manly type. He toured in America\r\nin 1817; and on retiring in 1822 from the operatic stage, he travelled\r\nthrough the provinces with an entertainment called \"The Wandering\r\nMelodist.\" He died of paralysis at Worcester on the 11th of February\r\n1826.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINCLINOMETER (DIP CIRCLE). Two distinct classes of instruments are used\r\nfor measuring the dip (see MAGNETISM, TERRESTRIAL) or inclination of the\r\nearth's magnetic field to the horizontal, namely (1) dip circles, and\r\n(2) induction inclinometers or earth inductors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n_Dip Circles._--In the case of the dip circle the direction of the\r\nearth's magnetic field is obtained by observing the position of the axis\r\nof a magnetized needle so supported as to be free to turn about a\r\nhorizontal axis passing through its centre of gravity. The needles now\r\nused consist of flat lozenge-shaped pieces of steel about 9 cm. long and\r\n0.1 cm. thick, and weigh about 4.1 grams. The axle, which is made of\r\nhard steel, projects on either side of the needle and has a diameter of\r\nabout 0.05 cm. Needles considerably larger than the above have been\r\nused, but experience showed that the values for the dip observed with\r\nneedles 23 cm. long, was about 1' less than with the 9 cm. needles, and\r\nA. Schuster (_Phil. Mag._, 1891 [5], 31, p. 275) has shown that the\r\ndifference is due to the appreciable bending of the longer needles owing\r\nto their weight.\r\n\r\nWhen in use the dip needle is supported on two agate knife-edges, so\r\nthat its axle is on the axis of a vertical divided circle, on which the\r\npositions of the ends of the needle are either directly observed by\r\nmeans of two reading lenses, in which case the circle is generally\r\ndivided into thirds of a degree so that it can by estimation be read to\r\nabout two minutes, or a cross arm carries two small microscopes and two\r\nverniers, the cross wires of each microscope being adjusted so as to\r\nbisect the image of the corresponding end of the needle. Two V-shaped\r\nlifters actuated by a handle serve to raise the needle from the agates,\r\nand when lowered assure the axle being at the centre of the vertical\r\ncircle. The supports for the needle, and a box to protect the needle\r\nfrom draughts, as well as the vertical circle, can be rotated about a\r\nvertical axis, and their azimuth read off on a horizontal divided\r\ncircle. There are also two adjustable stops which can be set in any\r\nposition, and allow the upper part of the instrument to be rotated\r\nthrough exactly 180° without the necessity of reading the horizontal\r\ncircle.\r\n\r\nWhen making a determination of the dip with the dip circle, a number of\r\nseparate readings have to be made in order to eliminate various\r\ninstrumental defects. Thus, that side of the needle on which the number\r\nis engraved being called the face of the needle, and that side of the\r\nprotecting box next the vertical circle the face of the instrument, both\r\nends of the needle are observed in the following relative positions, the\r\ninstrument being in every case so adjusted in azimuth that the axle of\r\nthe needle points magnetic east and west:--\r\n\r\n    i. Face of instrument east and face of needle next to face of\r\n         instrument;\r\n   ii. Face of instrument west and face of needle next to face of\r\n         instrument;\r\n  iii. Face of instrument west and face of needle away from face of\r\n         instrument;\r\n   iv. Face of instrument east and face of needle away from face of\r\n         instrument.\r\n\r\nNext the direction of magnetization of the needle is reversed by\r\nstroking it a number of times with two strong permanent magnets, when\r\nthe other end of the needle dips and the above four sets of readings are\r\nrepeated. The object in reading both ends of the needle is to avoid\r\nerror if the prolongation of the axle of the needle does not pass\r\nthrough the centre of the vertical circle, as also to avoid error due to\r\nthe eccentricity of the arm which carries the reading microscopes and\r\nverniers. The reversal of the instrument between (i.) and (ii.) and\r\nbetween (iii.) and (iv.) is to eliminate errors due to (a) the line\r\njoining the zeros of the vertical circle not being exactly horizontal,\r\nand (b) the agate knife-edges which support the needle not being exactly\r\nhorizontal. The reversal of the needle between (ii.) and (iii.) is to\r\neliminate errors due to (a) the magnetic axis of the needle not\r\ncoinciding with the line joining the two points of the needle, and (b)\r\nto the centre of gravity of the needle being displaced from the centre\r\nof the axle in a direction at right angles to the length of the needle.\r\nThe reversal of the poles of the needle is to counteract any error\r\nproduced by the centre of gravity of the needle being displaced from the\r\ncentre of the axle in a direction parallel to the length of the needle.\r\n\r\nFor use at sea the dip circle was modified, by Robert Were Fox (_Annals\r\nof Electricity_, 1839, 3, p. 288), who used a needle having pointed\r\naxles, the points resting in jewelled holes carried by two uprights, so\r\nthat the movement of the ship does not cause the axle of the needle to\r\nchange its position with reference to the vertical divided circle. To\r\ncounteract the tendency of the axle to stick in the bearings, the\r\ninstrument is fitted with a knob on the top of the box protecting the\r\nneedle, and when a reading is being taken this knob is rubbed with an\r\nivory or horn disk, the surface of which is corrugated. In this way a\r\ntremor is caused which is found to assist the needle in overcoming the\r\neffects of friction, so that it takes up its true position. In the Creak\r\nmodification of the Fox dip circle, the upper halves of the jewels which\r\nform the bearings are cut away so that the needle can be easily removed,\r\nand thus the reversals necessary when making a complete observation can\r\nbe performed (see also MAGNETO-METER).\r\n\r\n_Induction Inclinometers._--The principle on which induction\r\ninclinometers depend is that if a coil of insulated wire is spun about a\r\ndiameter there will be an alternating current induced in the coil,\r\nunless the axis about which it turns is parallel to the lines of force\r\nof the earth's field. Hence if the axis about which such a coil spins is\r\nadjusted till a sensitive galvanometer connected to the coil through a\r\ncommutator, by which the alternating current is converted into a direct\r\ncurrent, is undeflected, then the axis must be parallel to the lines of\r\nforce of the earth's field, and hence the inclination of the axis to the\r\nhorizontal is the dip. The introduction and perfection of this type of\r\ninclinometer is almost entirely due to H. Wild. His form of instrument\r\nfor field observations[1] consists of a coil 10 cm. in diameter,\r\ncontaining about 1000 turns of silk-covered copper wire, the resistance\r\nbeing about 40 ohms, which is pivoted inside a metal ring. This ring can\r\nitself rotate about a horizontal axle in its own plane, this axle being\r\nat right angles to that about which the coil can rotate. Attached to the\r\naxle of the ring is a divided circle, by means of which and two reading\r\nmicroscopes the inclination of the axis of rotation of the coil to the\r\nhorizontal can be read. The bearings which support the horizontal axle\r\nof the ring are mounted on a horizontal annulus which can be rotated in\r\na groove attached to the base of the instrument, as so to allow the\r\nazimuth of the axle of the ring, and hence also that of the plane in\r\nwhich the axis of the coil can move, to be adjusted. The coil is rotated\r\nby means of a flexible shaft worked by a small cranked handle and a\r\ntrain of gear wheels. The terminals of the coil are taken to a two-part\r\ncommutator of the ordinary pattern on which rest two copper brushes\r\nwhich are connected by flexible leads to a sensitive galvanometer. The\r\ninclination of the axis of the coil can be roughly adjusted by hand by\r\nrotating the supporting ring. The final adjustment is made by means of a\r\nmicrometer screw attached to an arm which is clamped on the axle of the\r\nring.\r\n\r\nWhen making a measurement the azimuth circle is first set horizontal, a\r\nstriding level placed on the trunnions which carry the ring being used\r\nto indicate when the adjustment is complete. The striding level is then\r\nplaced on the axle which carries the coil, and when the bubble is at the\r\ncentre of the scale the microscopes are adjusted to the zeros of the\r\nvertical circle. A box containing a long compass needle and having two\r\nfeet with inverted V's is placed to rest on the axle of the coil, and\r\nthe instrument is turned in azimuth till the compass needle points to a\r\nlubber line on the box. By this means the axis of the coil is brought\r\ninto the magnetic meridian. The commutator being connected to a\r\nsensitive galvanometer, the coil is rotated, and the ring adjusted till\r\nthe galvanometer is undeflected. The reading on the vertical circle then\r\ngives the dip. By a system of reversals slight faults in the adjustment\r\nof the instrument can be eliminated as in the case of the dip circle.\r\nWith such an instrument it is claimed that readings of dip can be made\r\naccurate to ±0.1 minutes of arc.\r\n\r\nThe form of Wild inductor for use in a fixed observatory differs from\r\nthe above in that the coil consists of a drum-wound armature, but\r\nwithout iron, of which the length is about three times the diameter.\r\nThis armature has its axle mounted in a frame attached to the sloping\r\nside of a stone pillar, so that the axis of rotation is approximately\r\nparallel to the lines of force of the earth's field. By means of two\r\nmicrometer screws the inclination of the axis to the magnetic meridian\r\nand to the horizontal can be adjusted. The armature is fitted with a\r\ncommutator and a system of gear wheels by means of which it can be\r\nrapidly rotated. The upper end of the axle carries a plane mirror, the\r\nnormal to which is adjusted parallel to the axis of rotation of the\r\narmature. A theodolite is placed on the top of the pillar and the\r\ntelescope is turned so that the image of the cross-wires, seen by\r\nreflection in the mirror, coincides with the wires themselves. In this\r\nway the axis of the theodolite telescope is placed parallel to the axis\r\nof the armature, and hence the dip can be read off on the altitude\r\ncircle of the theodolite.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--In addition to the references already given the\r\n  following papers may be consulted: (1) _Admiralty Manual of Scientific\r\n  Inquiry_, which contains directions for making observations with a dip\r\n  circle; (2) Stewart and Gee, _Elementary Practical Physics_, which\r\n  contains a full description of the dip circle and instructions for\r\n  making a set of observations; (3) L.

For the history\r\nof the inclosure of such lands, and the legislation, dating from 1235,\r\nwhich deals with it, see COMMONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN COENA DOMINI, a papal bull, so called from its opening words,\r\nformerly issued annually on Holy Thursday (in Holy Week), or later on\r\nEaster Monday. Its first publication was in 1363. It was a statement of\r\necclesiastical censure against heresies, schisms, sacrilege,\r\ninfringement of papal and ecclesiastical privileges, attacks on person\r\nand property, piracy, forgery and other crimes. For two or three hundred\r\nyears it was varied from time to time, receiving its final form from\r\nPope Urban VIII. in 1627. Owing to the opposition of the sovereigns of\r\nEurope both Protestant and Catholic, who regarded the bull as an\r\ninfringement of their rights, its publication was discontinued by Pope\r\nClement XIV. in 1770.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINCOME TAX, in the United Kingdom a general tax on income derived from\r\nevery source. Although a graduated tax on income from certain fixed\r\nsources was levied in 1435 and again in 1450, it may be said that the\r\nincome tax in its present form dates in England from its introduction by\r\nW. Pitt in 1798 \"granting to His Majesty an aid and contribution for the\r\nprosecution of the war.\" This act of 1798 merely increased the duties of\r\ncertain assessed taxes, which were regulated by the amount of income of\r\nthe person assessed, provided his income amounted to £60 or upwards.\r\nThese duties were repealed by an act of 1799 (39 Geo. III. c. 13), which\r\nimposed a duty of 10% on all incomes from whatever sources derived,\r\nincomes under £60 a year being exempt, and reduced rates charged on\r\nincomes between that amount and £200 a year. The produce of this tax was\r\n£6,046,624 for the first year, as compared with £1,855,996, the produce\r\nof the earlier tax. This income tax was repealed after the peace of\r\nAmiens, but the renewal of the war in 1803 caused its revival. At the\r\nsame time was introduced the principle of \"collection at the source\"\r\n(i.e. collection before the income reaches the person to whom it\r\nbelongs), which is still retained in the English Revenue system, and\r\nwhich, it has been said, is mainly responsible for the present\r\ndevelopment of income tax and the ease with which it is collected. The\r\nact of 1803 (43 Geo. III. c. 122) distributed the various descriptions\r\nof income under different schedules, known as A, B, C, D and E. A rate\r\nof 5% was imposed on all incomes of £150 a year and over, with\r\ngraduation on incomes between £60 and £150. This income tax of 5%\r\ncollected at the source yielded almost as much as the previous tax of\r\n10% collected direct from each taxpayer. The tax was continued from year\r\nto year with the principle unchanged but with variations in the rate\r\nuntil the close of the war in 1815, when it was repealed. It was, during\r\nits first imposition, regarded as essentially a war tax, and in later\r\ndays, when it was reimposed, it was always considered as an emergency\r\ntax, to be levied only to relieve considerable financial strain, but it\r\nhas now taken its place as a permanent source of national income, and is\r\nthe most productive single tax in the British financial system. The\r\nincome tax was revived in 1842 by Sir R. Peel, not as a war tax, but to\r\nenable him to effect important financial reforms (see TAXATION).\r\nVariations both in the rate levied and the amount of income exempted\r\nhave taken place from time to time, the most important, probably, being\r\nfound in the Finance Acts of 1894, 1897, 1898, 1907 and 1909-1910.\r\n\r\n  It will be useful to review the income tax as it existed before the\r\n  important changes introduced in 1909. It was, speaking broadly, a tax\r\n  levied on all incomes derived from sources within the United Kingdom,\r\n  or received by residents in the United Kingdom from other sources.\r\n  Incomes under £160 were exempt; an abatement allowed of £160 on those\r\n  between £160 and £400; of £150 on those between £400 and £500; of £120\r\n  on those between £500 and £600, and of £70 on those between £600 and\r\n  £700. An abatement was also allowed on account of any premiums paid\r\n  for life insurance, provided they did not exceed one-sixth of the\r\n  total income. The limit of total exemption was fixed in 1894, when it\r\n  was raised from £150; and the scale of abatements was revised in 1898\r\n  by admitting incomes between £500 and £700; the Finance Act 1907\r\n  distinguished between \"earned\" and \"unearned\" income, granting relief\r\n  to the former over the latter by 3d. in the pound, where the income\r\n  from all sources did not exceed £2000. The tax was assessed as\r\n  mentioned above, under five different schedules, known as A, B, C, D\r\n  and E. Under schedule A was charged the income derived from landed\r\n  property, including houses, the annual value or rent being the basis\r\n  of the assessment. The owner is the person taxed, whether he is or is\r\n  not in occupation. In England the tax under this schedule is obtained\r\n  from the occupier, who, if he is not the owner, recovers from the\r\n  latter by deducting the tax from the rent. In Scotland this tax is\r\n  usually paid by the owner as a matter of convenience, but in Ireland\r\n  it is by law chargeable to him. All real property is subject to the\r\n  tax, with certain exceptions:--(a) crown property, such as public\r\n  offices, prisons, &c.; (b) certain properties belonging to charitable\r\n  and educational bodies, as hospitals, public schools, colleges,\r\n  almshouses, &c.; (c) public parks or recreation grounds; (d) certain\r\n  realities of companies such as mines, quarries, canals, &c., from\r\n  which no profit is derived beyond the general profit of the concern to\r\n  which they belong. Under schedule B were charged the profits arising\r\n  from the occupation of land, the amount of such profits being assumed\r\n  to be one-third of the annual value of the land as fixed for the\r\n  purposes of schedule A. This applies principally to farmers who might,\r\n  if they chose, be assessed on schedule D on their actual profits.\r\n  Schedule C included income derived from interest, &c., payable out of\r\n  the public funds of the United Kingdom or any other country. Schedule\r\n  D, the most important branch of the income tax and the most difficult\r\n  to assess, included profits arising from trade, from professional or\r\n  other employment, and from foreign property, the assessment in most\r\n  cases being made on an average of the receipts for three years.\r\n  Schedule E covered the salaries and pensions of persons in the\r\n  employment of the state or of public bodies, and of the officials of\r\n  public companies, &c. The method of assessment and collection of the\r\n  tax is uniformly the same. Under schedules A, B and D it is in the\r\n  hands of local authorities known as the General or District\r\n  Commissioners of Taxes. They are appointed by the Land Tax\r\n  Commissioners out of their own body, and, as regards assessment, are\r\n  not in any way controlled by the executive government. They appoint a\r\n  clerk, who is their principal officer and legal adviser, assessors for\r\n  each parish and collectors. There is an appeal from their decisions to\r\n  the High Court of Justice on points of law, but not on questions of\r\n  fact. Assessments under schedules A and B are usually made every five\r\n  years, and under schedule D every year. The interests of the revenue\r\n  are looked after by officers of the Board of Inland Revenue, styled\r\n  surveyors of taxes, who are stationed in different parts of the\r\n  country. They are in constant communication with the Board, and with\r\n  the public on all matters relating to the assessment and collection of\r\n  the tax; they attend the meetings of the local commissioners, examine\r\n  the assessments and the taxpayers' returns, and watch the progress of\r\n  the collection. There are also certain officers, known as special\r\n  commissioners, who are appointed by the crown, and receive fixed\r\n  salaries from public funds. For the purpose of schedule D, any\r\n  taxpayer may elect to be assessed by them instead of by the local\r\n  commissioners; and those who object to their affairs being disclosed\r\n  to persons in their own neighbourhood may thus have their assessments\r\n  made without any risk of publicity. The special commissioners also\r\n  assess the profits of railway companies under schedule D, and profits\r\n  arising from foreign or colonial sources under schedules C and D. The\r\n  greater part of the incomes under schedule E is assessed by the\r\n  commissioners for public offices, appointed by the several departments\r\n  of the government.\r\n\r\nPreviously to 1909 the rate of income tax has been as high as 16d. (in\r\n1855-1857), and as low as 2d. (in 1874-1876). Each penny of the tax was\r\nestimated to produce in 1906-1907 a revenue of £2,666,867.[1]\r\n\r\nIt had long been felt that there were certain inequalities in the income\r\ntax which could be adjusted without any considerable difficulty, and\r\nfrom time to time committees have met and reported upon the subject.\r\nSelect committees reported in 1851-1852 and in 1861, and a Departmental\r\nCommittee in 1905. In 1906 a select committee was appointed to inquire\r\ninto and report upon the practicability of graduating the income tax,\r\nand of differentiating, for the purpose of the tax, between permanent\r\nand precarious incomes. The summary of the conclusions contained in\r\ntheir _Report_ (365 of 1906) was:--\r\n\r\n  1. Graduation of the income tax by an extension of the existing system\r\n  of abatements is practicable. But it could not be applied to all\r\n  incomes from the highest to the lowest, with satisfactory results. The\r\n  limits of prudent extension would be reached when a large increase in\r\n  the rate of tax to be collected at the source was necessitated, and\r\n  the total amount which was collected in excess of what was ultimately\r\n  retained became so large as to cause serious inconvenience to trade\r\n  and commerce and to individual taxpayers. Those limits would not be\r\n  exceeded by raising the amount of income on which an abatement would\r\n  be allowed to £1000 or even more.\r\n\r\n  2. Graduation by a super-tax is practicable. If it be desired to levy\r\n  a much higher rate of tax upon large incomes (say of £5000 and\r\n  upwards) than has hitherto been charged, a super-tax based on personal\r\n  declaration would be a practicable method.\r\n\r\n  3. Abandonment of the system of \"collection at the source\" and\r\n  adoption of the principle of direct personal assessment of the whole\r\n  of each person's income would be inexpedient.\r\n\r\n  4. Differentiation between earned and unearned incomes is practicable,\r\n  especially if it be limited to earned incomes not exceeding £3000 a\r\n  year, and effect be given to it by charging a lower rate of tax upon\r\n  them.\r\n\r\n  5. A compulsory personal declaration from each individual of total net\r\n  income in respect of which tax is payable is expedient, and would do\r\n  much to prevent the evasion and avoidance of income tax which at\r\n  present prevail.\r\n\r\nActing upon the report of this committee the Finance Bill of 1909 was\r\nframed to give effect to the principles of graduation and\r\ndifferentiation. The rate upon the earned portion of incomes of persons\r\nwhose total income did not exceed £3000 was left unchanged, viz. 9d. in\r\nthe pound up to £2000, and 1s. in the pound between £2000 and £3000. But\r\nthe rate of 1s. in the pound on all unearned incomes and on the earned\r\nportion of incomes over £2000 from all sources was raised to 1s. 2d. In\r\naddition to the ordinary tax of 1s. 2d. in the pound, a super-tax of 6d.\r\nin the pound was levied on all incomes exceeding £5000 a year, the\r\nsuper-tax being paid upon the amount by which the incomes exceed £3000 a\r\nyear. A special abatement of £10 a child for every child under the age\r\nof sixteen was allowed upon all incomes under £500 a year. No abatements\r\nor exemptions were allowed to persons not resident in the United\r\nKingdom, except in the case of crown servants and persons residing\r\nabroad on account of their health. Certain abatements for improvements\r\nwere also allowed to the owners of land or houses.\r\n\r\n  The estimated increased yield of the income tax for 1909-1910 on these\r\n  lines was £2,500,000, which excluded the abatements allowed for\r\n  improvements. The super-tax was estimated to yield a sum of £500,000,\r\n  which would be increased ultimately to £2,500,000, when all returns\r\n  and assessments were made.\r\n\r\nThe following accounts show the operation of the same system of taxation\r\nin other countries:--[2]\r\n\r\n  _Austria._--The income tax dates from 1849, but the existing tax,\r\n  which is arranged on a progressive system, came into force on the 1st\r\n  of January 1898. The tax is levied on net income, deductions from the\r\n  gross income being allowed for upkeep of business, houses and lands,\r\n  for premiums paid for insurance against injuries, for interest on\r\n  business and private debts, and for payment of taxes other than income\r\n  tax. Incomes under £50 a year are exempt, the rate of taxation at the\r\n  first stage (£52) being 0.6 of the income; at the twelfth stage (£100)\r\n  the rate is 1%, at the twenty-seventh stage (£300) it rises to 2%, at\r\n  the forty-third stage (£1000) it is 3%, and at the fifty-sixth (£2500)\r\n  it is 3½%; an income of £4000 pays 4%; from £4000 up to £8333 per\r\n  annum progression rises at £166 a step, and for every step £8, 6s. 8d.\r\n  taxation is assessed. Incomes between £8333 and £8750 pay £387, 10s.;\r\n  incomes over £8750 are taxed £20, 6s. 8d. at each successive stage of\r\n  £417, 10s. Certain persons are exempt from the tax, viz.:--(a) the\r\n  emperor; (b) members of the imperial family, as far as regards such\r\n  sums as they receive as allowances; (c) the diplomatic corps, the\r\n  consular corps who are not Austrian citizens, and the official staffs\r\n  and foreign servants of the embassies, legations and consulates; (d)\r\n  such people as are exempted by treaty or by the law of nations; (e)\r\n  people in possession of pensions from the Order of Maria Theresa, and\r\n  those who receive pensions on account of wounds or the pension\r\n  attached to the medal for bravery, are exempted as far as the pensions\r\n  are concerned; (f) officers, chaplains and men of the army and navy\r\n  have no tax levied on their pay; (g) all other military persons, and\r\n  such people as are included in the scheme of mobilization are exempted\r\n  from any tax on their pay. Special allowances are made for incomes\r\n  derived from labour, either physical or mental, as well as for a\r\n  family with several children. There are also special exemptions in\r\n  certain cases where the annual income does not exceed £4167, 10s.,\r\n  viz.--(a) special charges for educating children who may be blind,\r\n  deaf, dumb or crippled; (b) expense in maintaining poor relations; (c)\r\n  perpetual illness; (d) debts; (e) special misfortunes caused by fire\r\n  or floods; (f) being called out for military service. The tax is\r\n  assessed usually on a direct return from the individual taxpayer,\r\n  except in the cases of fixed salaries and wages, on which the tax is\r\n  collected from the employer, who either deducts it from the salary of\r\n  the employee or pays it out of his own pocket. The tax, which is\r\n  assessed on the income of the previous year, is paid direct to the\r\n  collector's office in two instalments--one on the 1st of June and the\r\n  other on the 1st of December.\r\n\r\n  _Belgium._--No income tax proper exists in Belgium, but there is a\r\n  state tax of 2% on the dividends of joint stock companies.\r\n\r\n  _Denmark._--Income tax is levied under a law of the 15th of May 1903.\r\n  Incomes under 2000 kroner pay a tax of 1.3%; under 3000 kroner, 1.4%;\r\n  under 4000 kroner, 1.5%; under 6000 kroner, 1.6%; under 8000 kroner,\r\n  1.7%; under 10,000 kroner, 1.8%; under 15,000 kroner, 1.9%; under\r\n  20,000 kroner, 2.0% and for every additional 10,000 kroner up to\r\n  100,000 kroner 1%, incomes of 100,000 kroner and upwards paying 2.5%.\r\n  Exempt from the duty are--the king, members of the royal family and\r\n  the civil list; the legations, staffs and consular officers of foreign\r\n  powers (not being Danish subjects); foreigners temporarily resident in\r\n  the country; mortgage societies, credit institutions, savings and loan\r\n  banks. The increase in capital resulting from an increase in value of\r\n  properties is not deemed income--on the other hand no deduction in\r\n  income is made if such properties decrease in value--nor are daily\r\n  payments and travelling expenses received for the transaction of\r\n  business on public service, if the person has thereby been obliged to\r\n  reside outside his own parish. Certain deductions can be made in\r\n  calculating income--such as working expenses, office expenses,\r\n  pensions and other burthens, amounts paid for direct taxation, dues to\r\n  commune and church, tithe, tenant and farming charges, heirs'\r\n  allowances and similar burthens; interest on mortgages and other\r\n  debts, and what has been spent for necessary maintenance or insurance\r\n  of the property of the taxpayer. There are also certain exemptions\r\n  with respect to companies not having an establishment in the country.\r\n\r\n  _France._--There is no income tax in France corresponding exactly to\r\n  that levied in the United Kingdom. There are certain direct taxes,\r\n  such as the taxes on buildings, _personnelle mobilière_, and doors and\r\n  windows (_impôts de répartition_)--the tax levied on income from land\r\n  and from all trades and professions (_impôts de quotité_) which bear a\r\n  certain resemblance to portions of the British income tax (see FRANCE:\r\n  _Finance_). From time to time a graduated income tax has been under\r\n  discussion in the French Chambers, the proposal being to substitute\r\n  such a tax for the existing (_personnelle mobilière_) and doors and\r\n  windows taxes, but no agreement on the matter has been reached.\r\n\r\n  _German Empire._--In Prussia the income tax is levied under a law of\r\n  the 24th of June 1891. All persons with incomes of over £150 per annum\r\n  are required to send in an annual declaration of their full income,\r\n  divided according to four main sources--(a) capital; (b) landed\r\n  property; (c) trade and industry; (d) employment bringing gain, this\r\n  latter including the salary or wages of workmen, servants and\r\n  industrial assistants, military persons and officials; also the\r\n  receipts of authors, artists, scientists, teachers and tutors.\r\n  Liability for income tax, however, begins with an income of £45, and\r\n  rises by a regular system of progression, the rate being about 3% of\r\n  the income. Thus an income of more than £45, but under £52, 10s. pays\r\n  a tax of 6s. and so on up to £475, an income over that sum but under\r\n  £525 paying a tax of 15s. Incomes over £525 rise by steps of £50 up to\r\n  £1525, for every step £1, 10s. being paid. Incomes between £1526 and\r\n  £1600 rise by steps of £75, £3 being paid for every step. Between\r\n  £1601 and £3900, the steps are £100, and the tax £4 a step; from £3901\r\n  to £5000 the steps are the same (£100), but the tax is £5 a step.\r\n  There is also a supplementary tax on property of about 1/20th% of the\r\n  assessed value. This supplementary tax is not levied on those whose\r\n  taxable property does not exceed a total value of £300, nor on those\r\n  whose annual income does not exceed £45, if the total value of their\r\n  taxable property does not exceed £1000, nor on women who have members\r\n  of their own family under age to maintain, nor on orphans under age,\r\n  nor on persons incapable of earning incomes if their taxable property\r\n  does not exceed £1000 nor their income £60. There are a number of\r\n  exemptions from the income tax, some of the more important being--(a)\r\n  the military incomes of non-commissioned officers and privates, also\r\n  of all persons on the active list of the army or navy as long as they\r\n  belong to a unit in war formation; (b) extraordinary receipts from\r\n  inheritances, presents, insurances, from the sale of real estate not\r\n  undertaken for purposes of industry or speculation, and similar\r\n  profits (all of which are reckoned as increases of capital); (c)\r\n  expenses incurred for the purpose of acquiring, assuring and\r\n  maintaining income; (d) interest on debts; (e) the regular annual\r\n  depreciation arising from wear of buildings, machines, tools, &c., in\r\n  so far as they are not included under working expenses; (f) the\r\n  contributions which taxpayers are compelled by law or agreement to pay\r\n  to invalid, accident, old age insurance, widow, orphan and pension\r\n  funds; (g) insurance premiums. Moreover, persons liable to taxation\r\n  with an income of not more than £150 may deduct from that income £2,\r\n  10s. for every member of their family under fourteen years of age, and\r\n  abatement is also allowed to persons with incomes up to £475 whose\r\n  solvency has been unfavourably affected by adverse economic\r\n  circumstances. The income tax is both levied at the source (as in the\r\n  case of companies) and assessed on a direct return by the taxpayer of\r\n  his income from all sources. Salaries are not taxed before payment.\r\n  Fixed receipts are assessed according to their amount for the taxation\r\n  year in which the assessment is made, and variable incomes on an\r\n  average of the three years immediately preceding the assessment. The\r\n  income tax and the supplementary tax are collected in the first half\r\n  of the second month of each quarter by the communities (_Gemeinden_)\r\n  who bear the whole cost.\r\n\r\n  In Saxony a graduated tax is in force on all incomes of £20 per annum\r\n  and upwards. All corporate bodies and individuals who derive their\r\n  income or any portion of it from Saxony are liable to the extent of\r\n  that income, except those serving religious, charitable or public\r\n  purposes. Incomes between £20 and £5000 are divided into 118 classes,\r\n  in which the rate rises progressively. From £500 to £5000 the classes\r\n  rise by £50, and above £5000 by £100. The rate of income tax begins at\r\n  ¼%, i.e. 1s. on an income of £20. An abatement is allowed to those\r\n  whose incomes do not exceed £155 of £2, 10s. for each child between\r\n  the ages of six and fourteen years, provided such abatements do not\r\n  reduce the income by more than one class. In the case of persons with\r\n  incomes not exceeding £290 abatement (not exceeding three classes) is\r\n  allowed--(a) when the support of children or indigent relations\r\n  involves a burden of such a nature as to affect the general standard\r\n  of living; (b) on account of long-continued illness, involving heavy\r\n  expense; and, on restoration to health, temporary decrease of\r\n  wage-earning power; (c) in the case of accidents which have had the\r\n  same effect.\r\n\r\n  In Bavaria the existing system of income tax came into force on the\r\n  1st of January 1900. The rate on earned income varies according to a\r\n  scale laid down in article 5 of the law, beginning at .1% for incomes\r\n  up to £37, 10s. (1s.), being .66% (£2, 5s.) for incomes between £230\r\n  and £250; 1.03% (£4) for incomes between £350 and £375; 1.30% (£6,\r\n  16s.) for incomes between £475 and £500 and 1.38% (£10) for incomes\r\n  between £650 and £700. Incomes exceeding £700 and not exceeding £1100\r\n  pay £1 on every £50; those between £1100 and £1700, £1, 10s., on every\r\n  £50, between £1700 and £2050, £2 on every £50; between £2050 and\r\n  £2500, £2, 10s. on every £50 and beyond £2500, 3% on every £50.\r\n  Exemptions from earned income tax are similar to those already\r\n  mentioned in the case of Prussia. Special abatement in the case of\r\n  incomes not exceeding £250 from all sources is given in consideration\r\n  of education of children, protracted illness, maintenance of poor\r\n  relations, serious accidents, &c. The tax on unearned income is at the\r\n  rate of 1½% on incomes from £3, 10s. to £5; from £6 to £20, 2%; from\r\n  £21 to £35, 2½%; from £36 to £59, 3%; from £51 to £150, 3½%; from £151\r\n  to £5000, 3¾%, and over £5000, 4%. There is a differentiation in\r\n  assessment on fluctuating and fixed incomes. Fluctuating incomes (e.g.\r\n  those derived from literary, scientific or artistic work) are assessed\r\n  at the average receipts of the two past years. Fixed income is\r\n  returned at the actual amount at the time of assessment, and the\r\n  assessment for earned income, both fixed and fluctuating, takes place\r\n  every four years. Income tax is not levied at the source, but on a\r\n  direct return by the taxpayer. In the case of unearned income, where a\r\n  person's yearly unearned income does not exceed £100 and he has no\r\n  other or only an insignificant additional income, he is required to\r\n  pay only half the assessed tax. Also in the case where a total income,\r\n  earned and unearned, does not exceed £250 it may, by claiming\r\n  abatement on such grounds as the education of children, maintenance of\r\n  indigent relations, &c., be assessed at the lowest rate but one, or be\r\n  entirely exempt.\r\n\r\n  In Württemberg the General Income Tax Act came into force on the 1st\r\n  of April 1905. Article 18 provides a graduated scale of rates on\r\n  incomes from £25 upwards. Abatements are allowed for the education and\r\n  support of children, support of indigent relatives, active service in\r\n  the army and navy, protracted illness and severe accidents or\r\n  reverses. There is a supplementary tax of 2% on unearned income from\r\n  certain kinds of property, such as interest or other income derived\r\n  from invested capital, dividends, &c., from joint-stock companies and\r\n  annuities of all kinds. The income tax is not levied at the source,\r\n  but on a direct return by the ratepayers; assessments are made on the\r\n  current year, except in the case of fluctuating incomes, when they are\r\n  made on the income of the preceding year.\r\n\r\n  _Hungary._--There is no income tax in Hungary at all corresponding to\r\n  that of the United Kingdom, although proposals for such a tax have\r\n  from time to time been made.\r\n\r\n  _Italy._--Graduated income tax in Italy dates from 1864. Incomes are\r\n  classified according to their characters, and the rate of the tax\r\n  varies accordingly. In class A¹ are placed incomes derived from\r\n  interests on capital, and perpetual revenues owned by the state,\r\n  interests and premiums on communal and provincial loans, dividends of\r\n  shares issued by companies guaranteed or subsidized by the state\r\n  lottery prizes. These incomes are assessed at their integral value and\r\n  pay the full tax of 20%. In class A² are placed incomes derived from\r\n  capital alone and all perpetual revenues. The assessments on these are\r\n  reduced to 30/40ths of the actual income and taxed at a rate of 15%.\r\n  In class B are incomes derived from the co-operation of labour and\r\n  capital, i.e. those produced by industries and commerce. The\r\n  assessments of these are reduced to 20/40ths and taxed at 10%. In\r\n  class C are placed incomes derived from labour alone (private\r\n  employment) and those represented by temporary revenues or life\r\n  annuities. Assessments on these are reduced to 18/40ths and taxed at a\r\n  rate of 9%. In class D are placed incomes from salaries, pensions and\r\n  all personal allowances made by the state, the provinces and communes.\r\n  Assessments on these are reduced to 15/40ths and taxed at 7½%.\r\n  Certain abatements are allowed on small incomes in classes B, C and D.\r\n  Incomes are assessed (1) on the average of the two preceding years in\r\n  the case of private industries, professions or companies in which\r\n  liability is unlimited; (b) on the income of the current year in the\r\n  case of incomes from dividends, salaries, pensions and fixed\r\n  allowances, as well as in the case of incomes of communes, provinces\r\n  and corporations; (c) on the basis of the account closed before the\r\n  previous July of the current year in the case of incomes of limited\r\n  liability companies, banks and savings banks.\r\n\r\n  _Netherlands._--In the Netherlands there is a property tax imposed\r\n  upon income derived from capital, as well as a tax on income earned by\r\n  labour.\r\n\r\n  _Norway._--In Norway under the state income tax incomes under 1000\r\n  kroner are exempt, those between 1000 and 4000 kroner pay 2% on that\r\n  part liable to taxation; those between 4000 and 7000 kroner pay 3%;\r\n  those between 7000 and 10,000 kroner pay 4%, and those above 10,000\r\n  kroner 5%. Persons liable to taxation are divided into (a) those who\r\n  have no one to support, as companies and the like; (b) those who have\r\n  from one to three persons to support; (c) those who have from four to\r\n  six persons to support; (d) those who have seven or more persons to\r\n  support. Those who are counted as dependent upon the taxpayer are his\r\n  children, own or adopted, his parents, brothers and sisters, and other\r\n  relations and connexions by marriage who might have a reasonable claim\r\n  to his support. A certain part of the income liable to taxation is\r\n  abated by a graduated scale according to the class into which the\r\n  ratepayer falls.\r\n\r\n  _Spain._--In Spain the income tax is divided into (a) that derived\r\n  from personal exertion and (b) that derived from property. Directors,\r\n  managers and representatives of banks, companies and societies pay\r\n  10%; those employed in banks, &c., commercial houses, and those in\r\n  private employment, as well as actors, bullfighters, professional\r\n  pelota-players, acrobats, conjurers, &c., pay 5%. Those employed by\r\n  the day or those whose salary is under £45 are exempt, as are also\r\n  masters in primary schools. Income derived from property is taxed\r\n  according to the source from which the income is derived, e.g. income\r\n  from shares in public works is rated at 20%, income from shares in\r\n  ordinary companies, railways, tramways or canals at 3%, from dividends\r\n  on bank shares at 5%, from mining shares at only 2%. There is also an\r\n  industry tax, i.e. on the exercise of industrial, commercial and\r\n  professional enterprises, which tax is divided into five different\r\n  tariffs, of which I. applies to commerce (vendors), II. also to\r\n  commerce (middlemen), III. to industry (machinery), IV. to professions\r\n  and V. to licences (retail and itinerant vendors). Tariff I. is\r\n  differentiated according to the importance of the business and of the\r\n  locality in which it is carried on, the rate being fixed by a\r\n  consideration of the two combined. Tariff II. is differentiated\r\n  according to the character of the enterprise, its importance and the\r\n  importance of the locality. Tariff III. is differentiated according to\r\n  either motive power, output, method, product or locality; Tariff IV.\r\n  according to the character of the profession and the importance of the\r\n  locality; Tariff V. is also differentiated according to the locality\r\n  and the importance of the business.\r\n\r\n  _Switzerland._--The system of income tax varies in the different\r\n  cantons. Broadly speaking, these may be divided into four different\r\n  kinds: (1) a graduated property tax, in which the rate applicable to\r\n  each class of fortune is definitely fixed; (2) a proportional tax,\r\n  under which property and income are chargeable, each at a fixed rate,\r\n  while the total amount of the tax is liable to a proportionate\r\n  increase according to scale if it exceeds certain specified amounts;\r\n  (3) a system by which property and income are divided into three\r\n  classes, the rate of the tax being increased by a graduated rise,\r\n  according to the class to which the property or income belongs, and\r\n  (4) a uniform rate of tax, with progression in the amount of income\r\n  liable to taxation.\r\n\r\n  _United States._--One of the means adopted by the Federal Government\r\n  for meeting its expenses during the Civil War was the levying of an\r\n  income tax. By the Act of Congress of the 5th of August 1861 a tax of\r\n  3% was imposed on all incomes, with an exemption of $800, and was made\r\n  payable on or before the 30th of June 1862. No tax, however, was\r\n  assessed under the law. In March 1862 a new income tax bill was\r\n  introduced into the House of Representatives. This act, which was\r\n  signed on the 1st of July 1862, imposed a tax of 3% on all incomes not\r\n  over $10,000, and 5% on all incomes above that sum, with an exemption\r\n  of $600. It was also provided that dividends of banks, insurance\r\n  companies and railways should be assessed directly; but the\r\n  bond-holder was allowed to deduct the dividend so assessed from his\r\n  taxable income. In the case of government salaries, the tax was\r\n  deducted before the salaries were paid. The income tax was first\r\n  levied in 1863. The rate was changed by act of Congress in 1865, 1867\r\n  and 1870, and a joint resolution in 1864 imposed a special additional\r\n  tax of 5% for that year. The tax was finally abolished in 1872. The\r\n  total amount produced by the tax from the beginning was $376,150,209.\r\n  The constitutionality of the act was subsequently brought into\r\n  question, but was upheld by a unanimous decision of the Supreme Court\r\n  in 1880, which held that the tax was not a direct tax but an excise\r\n  tax, and that Congress had a right to impose it so long as it was made\r\n  uniform throughout the United States. On the 27th of August 1894 an\r\n  income tax act was passed as part of the Wilson Bill. By this act it\r\n  was provided that a tax of 2% on all incomes should be levied from\r\n  the 1st of January 1895 to the 1st of January 1900, with an exemption\r\n  of $4000. The legality of the tax was assailed, chiefly on the ground\r\n  that it was a direct tax, and not apportioned among the several states\r\n  in proportion to their population. On the 20th of May 1895 the Supreme\r\n  Court, by a vote of five to four, declared the tax to be\r\n  unconstitutional. Accordingly, before any federal income tax could be\r\n  imposed, there was needed an amendment of the constitution, and a\r\n  movement in this direction gradually began. In the first year of the\r\n  presidency of Mr W. H. Taft both Houses of Congress passed by the\r\n  necessary two-thirds majority a resolution to submit the proposal to\r\n  the 46 states, the wording of the amendment being \"That Congress shall\r\n  have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes from whatever source\r\n  derived, without apportionment among the several States, and without\r\n  regard to any census enumeration.\"\r\n\r\n  _Cape Colony._--Cape Colony was the only South African colony which,\r\n  prior to the Union in 1910, had a system of income tax, which was\r\n  first imposed by an act of the 31st of May 1904. Incomes not exceeding\r\n  £1000 per annum were exempt from taxation; incomes exceeding £1000 but\r\n  not exceeding £2000 were taxed 6d. in the pound on the excess beyond\r\n  £1000; those between £2000 and £5000 were exempt for the first £1000,\r\n  paid 6d. in the pound on the next £1000 and 9d. in the pound on the\r\n  remainder; those exceeding £5000 paid 6d. in the pound on the second\r\n  £1000, 9d. in the pound on the next £3000 and 1s. in the pound on the\r\n  remainder.\r\n\r\n  _New South Wales._--Income tax in New South Wales first came into\r\n  operation on the 1st of January 1896. It is complementary with a land\r\n  tax, assessed on the unimproved value of freehold lands (with certain\r\n  exemptions and deductions). Incomes of £200 per annum and under are\r\n  exempt, and all other incomes (except those of companies) are entitled\r\n  to a reduction of £200 in their assessments. The rate of tax is 6d. in\r\n  the pound. There are certain incomes, revenues and funds which are\r\n  exempt from taxation, such as those of municipal corporations or other\r\n  local authorities, of mutual life insurance societies and of other\r\n  companies or societies not carrying on business for purposes of profit\r\n  or gain, and of educational, ecclesiastical and charitable\r\n  institutions of a public character, &c.\r\n\r\n  _New Zealand._--In New Zealand the income tax is also complementary\r\n  with a land tax. Incomes up to £300 per annum are exempt; incomes up\r\n  to £1000 per annum are taxed 6d. in the pound, with an exemption of\r\n  £300 and life insurance premiums up to £50; incomes over £1300 pay 1s.\r\n  in the pound, which is also the tax on the income of trading\r\n  companies, to whom no exemption is allowed. The income of friendly\r\n  societies, savings banks, co-operative dairy companies, public\r\n  societies not carrying on business for profit, &c., are exempt from\r\n  income tax.\r\n\r\n  _Queensland._--In Queensland income tax is levied on (a) income\r\n  derived from property such as rents, interest, income from companies,\r\n  royalties, &c., and (b) on income derived from personal exertion. On\r\n  income derived from property all incomes not exceeding £100 are\r\n  exempt; incomes between £100 and £120 pay £1 tax; those over £120 but\r\n  under £300 have £100 exempt and pay 1s. in each and every pound over\r\n  £100, while incomes over £300 pay 1s. in each and every pound. Incomes\r\n  from personal exertion pay 10s. between £100 and £125; £1 between £126\r\n  and £150; between £151 and £300 have £100 exempt and pay 6d. in each\r\n  and every pound over £100: between £301 and £500 6d. in every pound;\r\n  between £501 and £1000 6d. in every pound of the first £500 and 7d. in\r\n  every pound over £500, between £1001 and £1500 7d. in every pound of\r\n  the first £1000, and 8d. in every pound over £1000; incomes over £1500\r\n  pay 8d. in every pound; 1s. in every pound is charged on the incomes\r\n  of all companies and of all absentees.\r\n\r\n  _South Australia._--The income tax dates from 1884 and is levied on\r\n  all incomes arising, accruing in or derived from South Australia,\r\n  except municipal corporations, district councils, societies, &c., not\r\n  carrying on business for the purpose ot gain, and all friendly\r\n  societies. Where the income is derived from personal exertion the rate\r\n  of tax is 4½d. in the pound up to £800, and 7d. in the pound over\r\n  £800. For income derived from property the rate is 9d. in the pound up\r\n  to £800, and 1s. 1½d. in the pound over £800. There is an exemption of\r\n  £150 on incomes up to £400, but no exemption over that limit.\r\n\r\n  _Tasmania._--In Tasmania there is (a) an income tax proper, and (b) a\r\n  non-inquisitorial ability tax, one complementary to the other. The\r\n  income tax proper is levied on all income of any company, at the rate\r\n  of 1s. for every pound of the taxable amount; on all income of any\r\n  person, at the rate of 1s. for every pound of the taxable amount\r\n  derived from property, and on every dividend at the same rate.\r\n  Personal incomes of £400 and over are assessed at the full amount, but\r\n  an abatement of £10 for every £50 of income is allowed on incomes\r\n  below £400 down to incomes of £150, which thus have £50 deducted;\r\n  incomes between £120 and £150 have £60 deducted; incomes between £110\r\n  and £120, £70, and incomes between £100 and £110, £80. The ability tax\r\n  is paid by (a) occupiers and sub-occupiers of property and (b) by\r\n  lodgers. The amount of tax paid by occupiers or sub-occupiers is\r\n  calculated upon the assessed annual value of the property occupied,\r\n  and that of lodgers from the assessed annual value of their board and\r\n  lodging. A detailed account of both taxes will be found in House of\r\n  Commons Papers, No. 282 of 1905.\r\n\r\n  _Victoria._--In Victoria the rate of income tax is fixed annually by\r\n  act. The rate charged on income derived from property is exactly\r\n  double that charged on income derived from personal exertion, the\r\n  rate for which for 1905 was: on the first £500 or fractional part\r\n  thereof, 3d. in the pound; on the second £500 or fractional part\r\n  thereof, 4d. in the pound; on the third £500 or fractional part\r\n  thereof, 5d. in the pound; on all incomes in excess of £1500, 6d. in\r\n  the pound. All companies, except life insurance companies, were\r\n  charged 7d. in the pound on their incomes; life insurance companies\r\n  were charged 8d. in the pound.\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY.--The Annual Reports of the Commissioners of Inland\r\n  Revenue, the Reports of Committees and other references mentioned in\r\n  the article, as well as Dowell's _History of Taxation in England_\r\n  (1884); Dowell's _Acts relating to the Income Tax_ (6th ed., 1908),\r\n  and Robinson's _Law relating to Income Tax_ (2nd ed., 1908).\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [1] Full statistics of the yield of income tax and other information\r\n    pertaining thereto will be found in the _Reports of the Commissioners\r\n    of His Majesty's Inland Revenue_ (published annually); those issued\r\n    in 1870 and in 1885 are especially interesting.\r\n\r\n  [2] In Appendix No. 4 to the _Report from the Select Committee on\r\n    Income Tax_ (1906), will be found a valuable list (prepared in the\r\n    Library of the London School of Economics) of references to the\r\n    graduation of the income tax and the distribution of incomes both in\r\n    the United Kingdom and in other countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINCORPORATION (from Lat. _incorporare_, to form into a body), in law,\r\nthe embodying or formation of a legal corporation, brought about either\r\nby a general rule contained in such laws, e.g. as the Companies acts,\r\nand applicable wherever its conditions are satisfied; or by a special\r\nact of sovereign power, e.g. an incorporating statute or charter. The\r\nword is used also in the sense of uniting, e.g. a will may incorporate\r\nby reference other papers, which may be then taken as part of the will,\r\nas much as if they were set out at length in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINCUBATION and INCUBATORS. The subject of \"incubation\" (Lat. _incubare_,\r\nto brood; _in-cumbere_, to lie on), a term which, while strictly\r\nsignifying the action of a hen in sitting on her eggs to hatch them, is\r\nalso used in pathology for the development within the body of the germs\r\nof disease, is especially associated with the artificial means, or\r\n\"incubators,\" devised for hatching eggs, or for analogous purposes of an\r\nartificial foster-mother nature, or for use in bacteriological\r\nlaboratories.\r\n\r\nLife is dependent, alike for its awakening and its maintenance, upon the\r\ninfluence of certain physical and chemical factors, among which heat and\r\nmoisture may be regarded as the chief. It is therefore obvious that any\r\nmethod of incubation must provide for a due degree of temperature and\r\nmoisture. And this degree must be one within limits, for while all\r\norganisms are plastic and can attune themselves to a greater or less\r\nrange of variation in their physical environment, there is a given\r\ndegree at which the processes of life in each species proceed most\r\nfavourably. It is this particular degree, which differs for different\r\nspecies, which must be attained, if artificial incubation is to be\r\nsuccessfully conducted. In other words, the degree of temperature and\r\nmoisture within the incubation drawer must remain uniform throughout the\r\nperiod of incubation if the best results are to be reached. It is not\r\neasy to attain these conditions, for there are many disturbing factors.\r\nWe may therefore next consider the more important of them.\r\n\r\nThe chief causes which operate to make the temperature within the\r\nincubator drawer variable are the changes of the temperature of the\r\nouter air, fluctuations in the pressure of the gas when that is used as\r\nthe source of heat, or the gradual diminution of the oxidizing power of\r\nthe flame and wick when an oil lamp is substituted for gas. Also, the\r\nnecessary opening of the incubator drawer, either for airing or for\r\nsprinkling the eggs with water when that is necessary, tends to reduce\r\nthe temperature. But there is another equally important though less\r\nobvious source of disturbance, and this resides within the organism\r\nundergoing incubation. In the case of the chick, at about the ninth or\r\ntenth days of incubation important changes are occurring. Between this\r\nperiod and the fourteenth day the chick becomes relatively large and\r\nbulky, and the temporary respiratory organ, the allantois, together with\r\nits veins, increases greatly in size and extent. As a consequence, the\r\nrespiratory processes are enabled to proceed with greater activity, and\r\nthe chemical processes of oxidation thus enhanced necessarily largely\r\nincrease the amount of heat which the chick itself produces. Thus an\r\nincubator, to be successful, must be capable of automatically adjusting\r\nitself to this heightened temperature.\r\n\r\nThe drawer of an incubator is a confined space and is usually packed as\r\nclosely as possible with the contained eggs. The eggs are living\r\nstructures and consequently need air. This necessitates some method of\r\ndirect ventilation, and this in its turn necessarily increases the\r\nevaporation of water vapour from the surface of the egg. Unless,\r\ntherefore, this evaporation is checked, the eggs will be too dry at the\r\nperiod--from the tenth day onwards--when moisture is more than ever an\r\nimportant factor. There is, according to some poultry authorities,\r\nreason to believe that the sitting hen secretes some oily substance\r\nwhich, becoming diffused over the surface of the egg, prevents or\r\nretards evaporation from within; presumably, this oil is permeable to\r\noxygen. In nature, with the sitting hen, and in the \"Mamal\" artificial\r\nincubating establishments of the Egyptians, direct air currents do not\r\nexist, owing to the large size of the chambers, and consequently\r\nincubation can be successfully achieved without any special provision\r\nfor the supply of moisture.\r\n\r\nArtificial incubation has been known to the Egyptians and the Chinese\r\nfrom almost time immemorial. In Egypt, at Berme on the Delta, the trade\r\nof artificial hatching is traditionally transmitted from father to son,\r\nand is consequently confined to particular families. The secrets of the\r\nprocess are guarded with a religious zeal, and the individuals who\r\npractise it are held under plighted word not to divulge them. It is\r\nhighly probable that the process of artificial incubation as practised\r\nby the Egyptians is not so simple as it is believed to be. But as far as\r\nthe structures and processes involved have been ascertained by\r\ntravellers, it appears that the \"Mamal\" is a brick building, consisting\r\nof four large ovens, each of such a size that several men could be\r\ncontained within it. These ovens are in pairs, in each pair one oven\r\nbeing above the other, on each side of a long passage, into which they\r\nopen by a circular aperture, just large enough for a man to obtain\r\naccess to each. The eggs are placed in the middle of the floor of the\r\noven, and in the gutters round the sides the fire is lighted. The\r\nmaterial for this latter, according to one account, consists of camels'\r\ndung and chopped hay, and according to another of horses' dung. The\r\nattainment of the right degree of heat is apparently reached wholly by\r\nthe skill of the persons employed. When this has been attained, they\r\nplug the entrance hole with coarse tow. On the tenth to twelfth days\r\nthey cease to light the fires.\r\n\r\nEach \"Mamal\" may contain from 40,000 to 80,000 eggs. There are 386\r\n\"Mamals\" in the country, which are only worked for six months of the\r\nyear, and produce in that time eight broods. Many more than two-thirds\r\nof the eggs put in are successfully hatched. It is estimated that\r\n90,000,000 eggs are annually hatched by the Bermeans.\r\n\r\nA method of incubating that appears to have been altogether overlooked\r\nin England--or at least never to have been practised--is that carried on\r\nby the _Couveurs_ or professional hatchers in France. They make use of\r\nhen-turkeys for the purpose, and each bird can be made to sit\r\ncontinuously for from three to six months. The _modus operandi_ is as\r\nfollows: a dark room which is kept at a constant temperature throughout\r\nthe year contains a number of boxes, just large enough to accommodate a\r\nturkey. The bottom of the box is filled with some vegetable material,\r\nbracken, hay, heather, straw or cocoa-fibres. Each box is covered in\r\nwith lattice-work wire, so arranged that the freedom of the sitting bird\r\nis limited and its escape prevented. Dummy eggs, made by emptying addled\r\nones and filling with plaster of Paris, are then placed in the nest and\r\na bird put in. At first it endeavours to escape, but after an interval\r\nof a few days it becomes quiet, and the dummy eggs being then removed,\r\nfresh ones are inserted. As soon as the chickens are hatched, they are\r\nwithdrawn and fresh eggs substituted. The hen turkeys are also used\r\nsuccessfully as foster-mothers. Each bird can adequately cover about two\r\ndozen eggs.\r\n\r\nIncubation as an industry in Europe and America is of recent\r\ndevelopment. The growing scarcity of game birds of all kinds, coincident\r\nwith the increase of population, and the introduction of the\r\nbreech-loading gun, together with the marked revival of interest in\r\nfancy poultry about the year 1870, led, however, to the production of a\r\ngreat variety of appliances designed to render artificial incubation\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\nPreviously to this, several interesting attempts had been made. As long\r\nago as 1824, Walthew constructed an incubator designed to be used by\r\nfarmers' wives with the aid of no more than ordinary household\r\nconditions. It consisted of a double-walled metal box, with several\r\npipes opening into the walled space round the sides, bottom and top of\r\nthe incubator. These pipes were connected with an ordinary kitchen\r\nboiler. Walthew, however, constructed a fire grate, with a special\r\nboiler adapted to the requirements of the incubator. Into the walled\r\nspace of the incubator, steam from the kitchen boiler passed; the excess\r\nsteam escaped from an aperture in the roof, and the condensed steam\r\nthrough one in the floor. Ventilating holes and also plugs, into which\r\nthermometers were placed, pierced the door of the incubator.\r\n\r\nIn 1827, J. H. Barlow successfully reared hens and other birds by means\r\nof steam at Drayton Green, Ealing. He constructed very large rooms and\r\nrearing houses, expending many thousands of pounds upon the work. He\r\nreared some 64,000 game birds annually. The celebrated physician Harvey,\r\nand the famous anatomist Hunter were much interested in his results.\r\n\r\nTo John Champion, Berwick-on-Tweed, in 1870, belongs, however, the\r\ncredit of instituting a system which, when extended, may become the\r\nsystem of the future, and will rival the ancient \"Mamals\" in the success\r\nof the incubation and in the largeness of the numbers of eggs incubated.\r\nHe used a large room through which passed two heated flues, the eggs\r\nbeing placed upon a table in the centre. The flues opened out into an\r\nadjoining space. The temperature of the room was adjusted by personal\r\nsupervision of the fire. This system, more elaborated and refined, is\r\nnow in use in some parts of America.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bird Incubators._\r\n\r\nOwing to the great variety in the details of construction, it is\r\ndifficult to arrange a classification of incubators which shall include\r\nthem all. They may, however, be classified in one of two ways. We may\r\neither consider the method by which they are heated or the method by\r\nwhich their temperature is regulated.\r\n\r\nIn the former case we may divide them into \"hot-air\" incubators and into\r\n\"hot-water\" or \"tank\" incubators. In the latter ease we may classify\r\nthem according as their thermostat or temperature-regulator is actuated\r\nby a liquid expanding with rising temperature, or by solids, usually\r\nmetals.\r\n\r\nIn America incubators of the hot-air type with solid and metallic\r\nthermostats are most used, while in Europe the \"tank\" type, with a\r\nthermostat of expansible liquid, prevails.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of more adequately considering the various forms which\r\nhave been in use, or are still used, we shall here divide them into the\r\n\"hot-air\" and \"hot-water\" (or \"tank\") classes.\r\n\r\nIn the hot-air types the incubator chamber is heated by columns of hot\r\nair, while in the tank system this chamber is heated by a tank of warmed\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n  (a) _Hot-Water Incubators._--In 1866 Colonel Stuart Wortley described\r\n  in _The Field_ an incubator constructed upon a novel principle, but\r\n  which appears never to have been adopted by breeders. The descriptive\r\n  article is illustrated with a sketch. Essentially the incubator\r\n  consists of four pipes which extend across the egg chamber some little\r\n  distance above the eggs. The pipes pass through holes in the side of\r\n  the incubator, which are furnished with pads, so as to render their\r\n  passage air-tight. Externally they are connected with a boiler. This\r\n  is provided with a dome through which steam escapes, and also with a\r\n  glass gauge to show the height of the water within the boiler. The\r\n  water in the boiler is kept at the boiling point, and the temperature\r\n  of the incubator is regulated by adjustment of the length of the\r\n  hot-water pipes within the egg chamber. To raise the temperature, a\r\n  greater length of the pipes is pushed into the chamber, and to reduce\r\n  it, more of their length is pulled outwards. It is claimed for this\r\n  instrument that since the temperature of boiling water at any\r\n  particular locality remains practically constant, the disadvantages\r\n  due to fluctuations in the activity of a lamp flame or the size of a\r\n  gas flame are obviated. But it has the serious disadvantage that there\r\n  is no automatic adjustment to compensate for fluctuations of\r\n  atmospheric temperature. And experiments by C. Hearson have shown that\r\n  even if the temperature of the tank or source of heat be constant,\r\n  that of the incubator drawer will nevertheless vary with fluctuations\r\n  of external temperature. Probably if the mechanical difficulties of\r\n  providing a self-regulator were overcome, it would prove an efficient\r\n  and reliable incubator. The difficulties do not seem to be\r\n  insuperable, and it appears possible that a thermostatic bar could be\r\n  so arranged as to automatically increase or decrease the length of\r\n  hot-water pipes within the incubator, and therefore the incubator\r\n  temperature.\r\n\r\n  Another early form of incubator is Brindley's, which was first in use\r\n  about 1845, and in his hands it appeared occasionally to act\r\n  successfully, but it never became generally used. The egg chamber was\r\n  lined with felt, and was placed beneath a heated air chamber, the\r\n  floor and roof of which were composed of glass. The air chamber was\r\n  heated by a number of hot-water pipes which were connected with a\r\n  copper boiler. This latter was heated by means of a lamp so\r\n  constructed as to burn steadily. The temperature of the air chamber\r\n  was regulated within certain limits by means of a balanced valve,\r\n  which could be so adjusted that it would open at any desired\r\n  temperature.\r\n\r\n  In Colonel Stuart Wortley's incubator the hot-water tubes passed\r\n  directly into the egg chamber, and in Brindley's into a chamber above\r\n  it. But in other forms of incubators in which the principle of an\r\n  external boiler connected with water tubes is adopted, the latter pass\r\n  not into the egg chamber nor into an air chamber, but open into and\r\n  from a tank of water. The floor of this tank forms the roof of the egg\r\n  chamber, so that the eggs are heated from above. This device of\r\n  warming the eggs from above was adopted in imitation of the processes\r\n  that presumably occur with the sitting hen; for it is generally\r\n  assumed that the surface of the eggs in contact with the hen is warmer\r\n  than that in contact with the damp soil or with the material of the\r\n  nest.\r\n\r\n  One of the earliest of this form of incubator is that invented by F.\r\n  Schröder, manager of the now extinct British National Poultry Company.\r\n  In this incubator the form is circular, and there are four egg\r\n  drawers, so that each one occupied the quadrant of a circle, and the\r\n  inner corner of each drawer meets in the middle of the incubator. From\r\n  the centre of the incubator a vertical chimney passes upwards and\r\n  opens out from the inner corners of the four egg drawers. This chimney\r\n  acts as a ventilator to the incubating chambers. These latter are open\r\n  above, but their floors are made of perforated zinc, and when in use\r\n  they are partially filled with chaff or similar material. Under them\r\n  is a tank containing cold water and common to all four drawers; the\r\n  slight vapour rising from the surface of the water diffuses through\r\n  the egg drawers and thus insures a sufficient degree of humidity to\r\n  the air within. Above the egg drawers is a circular tank containing\r\n  warm water. The floor of this tank constitutes the roof of the egg\r\n  drawers, while the roof forms the floor of a circular chamber above\r\n  it, the side wall of which is composed of perforated zinc. This upper\r\n  chamber is used to dry the chicks when they are just hatched and to\r\n  rear them until they are strong enough for removal. It is partially\r\n  filled with sand, which serves the double purpose of retaining the\r\n  heat in the warm-water tank beneath and of forming a bed for the\r\n  chicks. The water in the warm-water tank is heated by means of a\r\n  boiler which is external to the incubator, and in communication with\r\n  the tank by means of an inlet and an outlet pipe. There is no valve to\r\n  regulate the temperature, and the latter is measured by means of a\r\n  thermometer, the bulb of which is situated not in the incubator\r\n  drawers, but in the warm-water tank. This is a wrong position for the\r\n  thermometer, since it is now known that the temperature of the water\r\n  tank may be different by several degrees to that of the egg drawer;\r\n  for with a fall of external temperature that of the latter necessarily\r\n  tends to fall more rapidly than the former. But, none the less, in\r\n  skilful hands this incubator gave good results.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 1.--Christy's Improved Incubator.]\r\n\r\n  T. Christy's incubator, which we shall describe next, has passed\r\n  through several forms. We shall consider the most recent one (1894).\r\n  The incubator (fig. 1) is double walled, and the space between the two\r\n  walls is packed with a non-conducting material. In the upper part of\r\n  the incubator there is a water tank (T) divided by a horizontal\r\n  partition into two chambers, communicating with each other at the\r\n  left-hand side. Below the tank is the incubation drawer (E), which\r\n  contains the eggs and also a temperature regulator or thermostat (R).\r\n  The tank is traversed by a ventilating shaft (V), and inserted into\r\n  this is a smaller sliding tube passing up to it from a hole in the\r\n  bottom of the incubator drawer. The floor of the incubator drawer is\r\n  perforated, and beneath it is an enclosed air space which opens into\r\n  the sliding air shaft just described. Fresh air is let into the\r\n  incubator drawer from a few apertures (I) at its top. The ventilating\r\n  shaft (V) is closed externally by a cap (C), which can be raised from\r\n  or lowered down upon its orifice by the horizontal arm (H) working\r\n  upon pivot joints at (P). This arm is operated by the thermostat (R),\r\n  through the agency of a vertical rod. The water in the tank is heated\r\n  by an external boiler (B) through two pipes, one of which (T) serves\r\n  as an inlet, and the other (L) as an outlet channel from the tank.\r\n  These two pipes do not open directly into the tank, but into an outer\r\n  vessel (O) communicating with it. Communication between this vessel\r\n  and the tank may be made or broken by means of a sliding valve (S),\r\n  which is pierced by an aperture that corresponds in position with the\r\n  upper of the two in the wall of the tank when the valve is up. When\r\n  this valve is in its upper position, the tank (T) communicates with\r\n  the outer vessel (O) by two apertures (A and A´), the top one being\r\n  the inlet and the lower one the outlet. These coincide in position\r\n  with the tubes from the boiler. This latter (B) is a conical vessel\r\n  containing two spaces. The heated water is contained in the outer of\r\n  these spaces, while the central space is an air shaft heated by a lamp\r\n  flame. This particular form of the boiler results in the water at its\r\n  top part being more heated than that in its lower. As a consequence of\r\n  this, a continual circulation of water through the tank ensues. The\r\n  more heated water, being specifically lighter, passes into the outer\r\n  vessel, where it remains among the higher strata, and therefore enters\r\n  the tank through the upper aperture. In passing along the upper\r\n  division of the tank it becomes slightly cooled and sinks therefore\r\n  into the lower compartment, passes along it, and out through the\r\n  aperture A´. Hence it passes into the lower portion of the boiler,\r\n  where it becomes warmed and specifically lighter; in consequence it\r\n  becomes pushed upwards in the boiler by the cooler and heavier water\r\n  coming in behind and below it.\r\n\r\n  Should the temperature in the incubator drawer rise, the bimetallic\r\n  thermostat (R) opens out its coil and pulls down the vertical rod.\r\n  This simultaneously effects two things: it raises the cap (C) over the\r\n  ventilating shaft and allows of a more rapid flow of fresh air through\r\n  the incubator drawer, and it also lowers the slide-valve (S) so that\r\n  the tank becomes cut off from communication with the outer vessel (O)\r\n  and therefore with the boiler. The temperature thereupon begins to\r\n  fall and the thermostat, coiling closer, raises the vertical rod,\r\n  closes the ventilating shaft, and once more places the tank in\r\n  communication with the boiler.\r\n\r\n  The structure of the thermostat is given below.\r\n\r\n  The Chantry Incubator (Sheffield) is also an incubator with a\r\n  hot-water tank, the circulation of which is maintained by an outside\r\n  boiler. Its temperature is regulated by a metal regulator.\r\n\r\n  In Schröder's and Christy's incubators the hot-water pipes from the\r\n  boiler simply entered the warm-water tank but did not traverse it. In\r\n  the two incubators to be next described the hot-water pipes are made\r\n  to pass through the water in the tank, and are so arranged as to\r\n  minimize the possibility that the outside of the tank may become\r\n  colder than the centre. Both of them are also fitted with an ingenious\r\n  though slightly complex valve for maintaining an approximately\r\n  constant temperature.\r\n\r\n  Halsted's incubator was the earliest of this type. Since his original\r\n  form was constructed he has designed an improved one, and it is this\r\n  latter which will be described.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG 2.--Halsted's Incubator.]\r\n\r\n  The egg drawer (E, fig. 2) lies beneath the warm-water tank (T), and\r\n  above this is a nursery (N). The egg drawer is ventilated by two\r\n  tubular shafts (V), of which only one is represented in the\r\n  illustration; the tubes are about 2½ in. in diameter, and each one is\r\n  fitted at its upper end, where it opens into the nursery, with a\r\n  swing-valve (V´) which turns upon a horizontal axis (A), in its turn\r\n  connected, by means of cranks (C) and shafts (S), with the heat\r\n  regulating apparatus (R). A space of about 2 in. between the top of\r\n  the incubating drawer and the warm-water tank is necessary for the\r\n  insertion of this apparatus. The water in the tank (T) is heated by\r\n  means of the boiler (B); the tank and boiler are connected by the two\r\n  pipes (I) and (O), of which one is the inlet and the other the outlet\r\n  channel. The boiler consists of an inner (I´) and an outer (O)\r\n  division in communication with each other below. The latter is\r\n  cylindrical in form, while the outer wall of the former is cylindrical\r\n  and its inner wall conical. The conical wall of the inner boiler is\r\n  the surface which is heated by the lamp (L). The arrangement of the\r\n  inlet and outlet tubes is important. In the illustration, for the sake\r\n  of clearness, they are represented as one above the other. In reality\r\n  they lie in the same plane, and the fork (F) of the inlet pipe\r\n  similarly lies in the horizontal plane and not vertically as\r\n  represented. The inlet pipe not only differs from the outlet pipe in\r\n  the possession of a forked end, but it is carried to the farther end\r\n  (not shown in the diagram) of the water tank, while the outlet pipe\r\n  opens from about the middle of the tank. The inlet pipe is connected\r\n  with the inner portion of the boiler and the outlet one with the outer\r\n  portion. The result of this adjustment of the parts is that the warmer\r\n  water of the inner boiler, being specifically lighter than the cooler\r\n  water of the outer boiler, rises up and passes through the inlet pipe\r\n  (I) and is discharged into the tank through the two divergent orifices\r\n  of the fork (F). Here the water strikes the side wall of the farther\r\n  end of the tank and is reflected back along the back and front walls\r\n  towards the nearer side. Hence it is again reflected, but in the\r\n  opposite direction, and now forms a central current, which is directed\r\n  towards the centrally situated orifice of the outlet tube (O). Through\r\n  this it passes to the outer boiler, and sinking towards the bottom,\r\n  reaches the base of the inner boiler. Here it becomes heated and\r\n  lighter and consequently rises to the top, and once more passes\r\n  through the inlet pipe to the water tank. The warm water thus travels\r\n  round the outer walls of the tank and the cooled water is conducted\r\n  away along the middle portion. A more equable distribution of\r\n  temperature over the roof of the incubating chamber is thus ensured\r\n  than would be the case if the heated water were discharged either into\r\n  the centre or at any other single point only of the tank.\r\n\r\n  To a very large extent, the efficiency of this apparatus depends upon\r\n  the approximately perfect performance of the lamp. A good, steadily\r\n  burning one should be employed, and only the best oil used; for,\r\n  should the wick become fouled the flame cannot freely burn. For this\r\n  reason it is better to use gas, whenever obtainable.\r\n\r\n  The maintenance of an approximately uniform temperature is obtained by\r\n  allowing the heated air of the egg-drawer to escape through the two\r\n  ventilating shafts (V). The swing-valves of these are opened or closed\r\n  by means of the regulator (R). This latter consists of a glass bowl\r\n  prolonged into a tube, about 8 in. long and three-eighths of an inch\r\n  in diameter. The glass tube swings upon an axis (A) which is situated\r\n  as near as possible to the bowl of the regulator. The axis is\r\n  connected with a crank (C´) which is disposed so as to act as a lever\r\n  upon the vertical shaft (S), which in its turn is connected with the\r\n  upper crank (C); this works the axis (A´) of the swing-valves, and so\r\n  can open or close the apertures of the ventilating pipes. The bowl of\r\n  the regulator is filled with mercury to such an extent that at the\r\n  temperature of 100° F., and when the tube is slightly inclined upwards\r\n  from the horizontal it just flows slightly into the tube from the\r\n  bowl. On the lever-crank (C´) a weight is slung by a sliding\r\n  adjustment, and is so placed that when the temperature of the\r\n  egg-drawer is 103° it just balances the tube of the regulator when it\r\n  is slightly inclined upwards. Should the temperature of the drawer now\r\n  rise higher the mercury flows towards the distant end of the tube and,\r\n  causing it to fall down, brings about a rotation of the regulator axis\r\n  and as a consequence the opening of the ventilating valves. A\r\n  transverse stay prevents the limb of the regulator from quite reaching\r\n  the horizontal when it falls. As the temperature cools down the\r\n  mercury contracts and retraces to the nearer end of the tube and to\r\n  the bowl, and consequently results in the upward inclination of the\r\n  limb; the valves are thus closed again.\r\n\r\n  The egg-drawer (E) is specially constructed so as to imitate as nearly\r\n  as possible the natural conditions that exist under a sitting hen. The\r\n  drawer is of wood and contains a zinc tray (Z) into which cold water\r\n  is placed. Fitting into the zinc tray is another zinc compartment, the\r\n  floor of which is made of a number of zinc strips (X) transversely\r\n  arranged and placed in relation to each other like the limbs of an\r\n  inverted V. The limbs are so disposed that those of one series do not\r\n  touch the adjacent ones, and in fact a space is left between them.\r\n  Thus a number of parallel troughs are formed, each of which opens\r\n  below into the moist air chamber of the cold water tray beneath. In\r\n  practice these troughs are covered with flannel which is allowed to\r\n  dip into the water of the tray. Thus the eggs lie in a series of damp\r\n  troughs and their lower surfaces are therefore damper and colder than\r\n  their upper ones. This incubator, if carefully worked and the\r\n  necessary practical details observed, has the reputation of being an\r\n  efficient machine.\r\n\r\n  Somewhat similar to the Halsted incubator, but differing from it in\r\n  the nature of the boiler and in the temperature regulator, is the\r\n  Graves incubator, made in Boston, U.S.A. The incubator itself (fig. 3)\r\n  consists of an incubating or egg-drawer (E) heated from above by a\r\n  warm-water tank (T). Below the egg-drawer is a tank containing cold\r\n  water, the vapour of which passes through the perforated floor of the\r\n  former and keeps the air of the egg-chamber slightly humid. Above the\r\n  warm-water tank is an air chamber (AC) to serve as a non-conducting\r\n  medium and to prevent therefore undue loss of heat. Above this is a\r\n  nursery or drying chamber (N), closed in, with a movable lid.\r\n\r\n  The warm-water tank is heated by means of a simple boiler (B) from\r\n  which an inlet tube (I) carries heated water to the tank; the tube\r\n  traverses the length of the tank and discharges at its farther end\r\n  (not shown in the diagram). From the nearer end of the tank an outlet\r\n  tube (O) passes out and opens into the boiler at a slightly higher\r\n  level than the inlet one. The boiler is heated by an evenly burning\r\n  lamp below, of special construction. The rectangular tube through\r\n  which the wick passes is bevelled at its outer end, and upon this\r\n  bevelled edge a metal flap (F) is allowed to rest more or less\r\n  closely, according as the flame is to be smaller or larger\r\n  respectively. The wick is, of course, bevelled to correspond to the\r\n  form of its tube. The metal flap is raised or depressed by means of\r\n  levers connected with the heat-regulator. When it is depressed upon\r\n  the wick the flame is lessened; and it becomes proportionately bigger\r\n  as the flap is raised more and more.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 3.--Graves's Incubator.]\r\n\r\n  The heat-regulator consists of a glass tube (T) which runs the whole\r\n  width of the incubation chamber and lies in contact with the floor of\r\n  the warm-water tank; it is filled with alcohol. Externally to the\r\n  incubator this tube is connected with a U-shaped one containing\r\n  mercury. The free limb of the U-tube contains a piston (P) which rests\r\n  upon the surface of the mercury in that limb. From the piston a piston\r\n  rod (PR) passes vertically upwards and is connected with a lever (L)\r\n  which operates, through the agency of a second lever (L´) the\r\n  movements of the ventilating valve (V) inserted over the orifice of\r\n  the ventilating shaft (A) which opens from the roof of the incubator\r\n  drawer. The lever (L) is further connected with a spiral spring (S)\r\n  which works the metal flap of the lamp already described. The height\r\n  of the piston in the U tube can be so adjusted, by varying the\r\n  quantity of mercury in the tube, that when the temperature of the\r\n  incubation drawer is 103° F., the ventilating valves are closed and\r\n  the wick is burning to its full extent. Should the temperature rise,\r\n  the alcohol in the glass tube (T) expands and causes the mercury in\r\n  the free limb of the U tube to rise. This carries with it the piston,\r\n  and this movement brings about the opening of the ventilating valves,\r\n  and at the same time, through the agency of the lever (L) and the\r\n  spiral spring (S) the metal flap is brought down upon the wick,\r\n  cutting off more or less of the flame. Should the temperature then\r\n  fall to 103° or lower, the contraction of the alcohol reverses these\r\n  movements, the valve closes, and the wick once more burns to its full\r\n  extent.\r\n\r\n  In practice, the boiler and the temperature regulator are duplicated,\r\n  there being a set on both sides of the incubator. Any slight\r\n  irregularity on the one side may be thus compensated for by the other\r\n  side.\r\n\r\n  Graves's incubator has the reputation of being a good machine.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 4.--Hearson's Incubator.]\r\n\r\n  Among the most recent type of incubators made in England is that of\r\n  Charles Hearson. This differs from any of those described in the\r\n  simplicity and ingenuity of the heat regulator, and in that the tubes\r\n  which traverse the water tank are hot-air flues, carrying the air\r\n  heated by the flame and not warm water. Consequently a further\r\n  simplification is introduced inasmuch as no boiler is required.\r\n\r\n  The essential features of this incubator are shown in fig. 4. The\r\n  internal parts of the incubator are insulated by a double wall, the\r\n  interspace being packed by a non-conducting material, which is not\r\n  shown in the figure. The incubation or egg-drawer (E) is heated by the\r\n  warm-water tank (T). Beneath the egg-drawer is a zinc tray (Z), so\r\n  constructed that in the central part the floor is raised up into a\r\n  short cylinder. Around the raised cylinder is a wide trough containing\r\n  water and into this dips a canvas cloth which is stretched out over a\r\n  perforated zinc support (F). By this means an extended moistened\r\n  surface is produced which allows of a rapid evaporation. The floor of\r\n  the incubator, which is raised by short feet from the table on which\r\n  it stands, is perforated in the central portion by a number of holes,\r\n  and which are so situated that they lie beneath the raised cylinder of\r\n  the cold-water tray (Z). The incubation-drawer is thus supplied\r\n  continuously by a slow current of moistened air because the air in the\r\n  upper part of the drawer, i.e. in contact with the floor of the\r\n  warm-water tank, is the warmest and lightest. It therefore tends to\r\n  diffuse or pass through the narrow slits between the drawer and the\r\n  walls of the incubator, and also through the aperture in the front\r\n  wall of the egg-drawer, through which a thermometer is laced. To\r\n  replace the air thus lost, fresh air passes in through the holes in\r\n  the bottom of the incubator, and on its way must pass through the\r\n  pores of the damp canvas which dips into the water in the zinc tray\r\n  (Z).\r\n\r\n  The warm-water tank is heated by an inlet (I) and outlet (O) flue\r\n  which are, however, continuous. The inlet flue opens out from a\r\n  vertical chimney (C), the air in which is heated either by a gas flame\r\n  or that of an oil lamp. The outlet or return flue passes back through\r\n  the width of the tank and opens independently to the exterior. The\r\n  vertical chimney (C) is capped by a lid (L) capable of being raised or\r\n  lowered upon its orifice by the lever (L´). When the cap is resting\r\n  upon the chimney all the heated air from within the latter passes\r\n  through the flues and heats the water in the tank. If the cap is\r\n  widely raised, practically all the heated air passes directly upwards\r\n  through the chimney and none goes through the flues. If the cap be but\r\n  slightly raised, part of the heated air goes through the flues and\r\n  part directly escapes through the aperture of the chimney. The\r\n  movement of the lever (L´) which raises the cap (L) is determined by\r\n  the thermostatic capsule (S), situated within the egg-drawer.\r\n\r\n  The principle upon which this capsule is designed is that the boiling\r\n  point of a liquid depends not only upon temperature but also upon\r\n  pressure. A given liquid at ordinary atmospheric pressure will boil at\r\n  a certain degree of temperature, which varies for different\r\n  substances. But if the pressure be increased the boiling point of the\r\n  liquid is raised to a higher degree of temperature. A liquid when it\r\n  boils passes into a gaseous condition and in this state will occupy a\r\n  very much larger volume--some two or three hundred times--than in the\r\n  liquid condition. If, therefore, a hermetically sealed capsule with\r\n  flexible sides be filled with some liquid which boils at a given\r\n  temperature, the sides of the capsule will distend when the\r\n  temperature of the air round the capsule has been raised to the\r\n  boiling point of the liquid within it. The distension of this capsule\r\n  can be used to raise the lever (L´). The thermostatic capsule is\r\n  placed on a fixed cradle (F) and is filled with a mixture of ether and\r\n  alcohol, the proportions being such that the boiling point of the\r\n  mixed liquid is 100° F. Between the capsule and the lever (L´) is a\r\n  vertical rod (V), articulating with the lever as close as possible to\r\n  its fulcrum (M). The articulation with the lever is by means of a\r\n  screw, so that the necessary nice adjustment between the height of the\r\n  rod (V), the thickness of the capsule and the position of rest of the\r\n  damper (L) upon the chimney, can be accurately made. The temperature\r\n  at which it is desired that the liquid in the capsule shall boil can\r\n  be determined by sliding the weight (W) nearer or farther to the\r\n  fulcrum of the lever (L´). The farther it is moved outwards, the\r\n  greater is the pressure upon the thermostatic capsule and consequently\r\n  the higher will be the boiling point of its contained liquid. By means\r\n  of the milled-head screw (A), the height of the lever at its outer end\r\n  can be so adjusted that when the liquid of the capsule is not boiling\r\n  the damper (L) closes the chimney, but that when it does boil the\r\n  damper will be raised sufficiently high from it. If the weight is\r\n  pushed as far as it will go towards the fulcrum end of the lever, the\r\n  temperature of the egg-drawer will never rise more than 100° F.\r\n  because at this temperature and under the pressure to which it is then\r\n  subjected, the liquid in the capsule boils, and consequently brings\r\n  about the raising of the damper. It matters not, therefore, how high\r\n  the flame of the gas or lamp be turned, the temperature of the\r\n  egg-drawer will not increase, because the extra heat of the enlarged\r\n  flame is passing directly outwards through the chimney, and is not\r\n  going through the flues in the tank. In order to raise the temperature\r\n  within the incubation chamber to 102° or 103°, or any other desired\r\n  degree, the weight (W) must be moved outwards along the lever (L´),\r\n  about 1 in. for every degree of temperature increase desired. This\r\n  thermostatic capsule works admirably, and the incubator will work for\r\n  months at a time and requires no adjustment, however much, within the\r\n  limits of our climate, the external temperature may vary. The capsule,\r\n  like all other thermostats in which the expansible substance is a\r\n  liquid, is, however, dependent upon external pressure for the point at\r\n  which its contained liquid boils and therefore, for the degree of\r\n  temperature prevailing within the incubator drawer. It is therefore\r\n  responsive to variations in atmospheric pressure, and as the barometer\r\n  may fall 1 or 2 in., this may possibly make a difference of two or\r\n  three degrees in the fluctuation of temperature within the egg-drawer.\r\n  It is not, of course, often that such large oscillations of the\r\n  barometer occur, and as a matter of practical experience, under\r\n  ordinary conditions, this incubator will work for months together\r\n  without attention with only half a degree variation round the point at\r\n  which it was set.\r\n\r\n  Greenwood's incubator (fig. 5), named the Bedford, resembles Pearson's\r\n  in that hot-air flues (F and F´) and not hot-water pipes, traverse the\r\n  water tank (T). And the method of regulation of the temperature is\r\n  much the same, i.e. a thermostat (V) operating upon a lever which\r\n  raises a cap (C) from off the aperture of the main flue (F) and thus\r\n  allows all the heat of the flame to pass directly outwards, without\r\n  passing through the series of flues (F) which horizontally traverse\r\n  the water-tank. Fresh air enters through a wide circular aperture (A)\r\n  which surrounds the main flue, and it thus becomes partially warmed\r\n  before entering the egg-chamber. The eggs are placed upon a perforated\r\n  floor (E) lying over water baths (B). The water tank (T) lies in the\r\n  centre of the incubation chamber and is traversed through its central\r\n  axis by the main hot-air flue (F). From this, four horizontal flues\r\n  pass outwards through the water and open into small vertical flues,\r\n  which in their turn communicate with the exterior.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 5.--The Bedford (Greenwood's) Incubator.]\r\n\r\n  The thermostat (V) consists of a glass tube of peculiar form. This is\r\n  closed at the end of its short limb and open at its other extremity on\r\n  the long limb. The bent portion of the tube is filled with mercury and\r\n  between the mercury column and the closed end is a small quantity of\r\n  ether. The thermostat is lodged in a box (G), which forms part of the\r\n  lever (L). At one end this lever is pivoted to a fixed arm, and at the\r\n  other to the vertical rod which operates the ventilating cap (C). If\r\n  the temperature should rise, the ether in the thermostat expands and\r\n  pushes the mercury column up along the inclined long limb. This\r\n  disturbs the equilibrium of the lever (L), and it descends downwards,\r\n  pulling with it the vertical rod, and thus raising the cap over the\r\n  main flue. If the temperature falls the reverse series of changes\r\n  occur. The temperature at which the cap will be raised can be adjusted\r\n  within limits by the position of the weight (W) and by the adjustment\r\n  of the degree of inclination of the thermostat.\r\n\r\n  The Proctor incubator, made at Otley, is apparently, in its main\r\n  features, similar to the Greenwood.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 6.--The Winchcombe Incubator.]\r\n\r\n  Somewhat similar, in certain features, to the Greenwood is the\r\n  Winchcombe. Its improved form, in which metal replaces the wood\r\n  casing, is named the Gladstone. In it there is a combination of the\r\n  hot-air and the water-tank systems of warming the incubation chamber.\r\n  The wall of the incubator is double, and the space between the outer\r\n  and inner wall is packed with a non-conducting material. The\r\n  incubation chamber is heated above by a water-tank (fig. 6 T) which is\r\n  traversed by a main vertical flue (F) and four subsidiary horizontal\r\n  ones which discharge externally. The main flue, however, in passing up\r\n  to enter the water tank traverses the egg-chamber, and therefore\r\n  serves to warm it, as in the hot-air type of incubator, by the heat of\r\n  the flue itself. Around the lower half of the flue is a water vessel\r\n  consisting of two concentric containers (C), holding water. In the\r\n  space between these concentric containers, fresh air passes in through\r\n  the aperture (A), and before it reaches the egg-chamber it passes\r\n  through coarse canvas which dips into the water in the containers, and\r\n  is therefore kept permanently moist. The containers are filled from a\r\n  water tank (S) outside the incubator. Air passes out from the\r\n  egg-chamber through the aperture (O). The temperature is regulated by\r\n  a bimetallic thermostat (see below), which operates two levers, that\r\n  by their arrangement can raise or depress the cap (D) over the main\r\n  flue (F). The temperature at which this occurs will be determined,\r\n  within limits, by the position of the adjustable weight (W).\r\n\r\n  Tomlinson's incubator, designed in 1880, is novel in principle. It\r\n  possesses a very large water tank, holding 15 gallons for every\r\n  hundred eggs. Through this tank there pass two hot-air horizontal\r\n  flues, lying in the same plane. The novelty of the construction lies\r\n  in the great volume of water used and in the disposition of the flues\r\n  towards the top of the tank. It is said that very little circulation\r\n  of water takes place beneath the flues, because warmed water rises\r\n  instead of falling. The great body of water below the flues will\r\n  therefore only take up heat relatively slowly, and will, on account of\r\n  its bulk and its physical properties, but slowly lose it. Should the\r\n  flame fall in power, or even go out for ten or twelve hours, it is\r\n  claimed that no serious loss of efficiency of the apparatus will\r\n  result.\r\n\r\n  Regulation of the temperature is by means of an air tube, the air in\r\n  which expanding bulges out an india-rubber diaphragm and this moves a\r\n  lever. The lever operates a valve which allows more or less of the\r\n  heated air to escape from the egg-drawer.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 7.--Hillier's Incubator.]\r\n\r\n  (b) _Hot-air Incubators._--W. H. Hillier's Incubator (fig. 7) is\r\n  circular in form and is constructed of a double-walled metal case. The\r\n  space between the two walls is packed with a non-conducting material.\r\n  The incubation or egg-chamber (C) is warmed by a circular heating box\r\n  (H), and the air in this is heated by a lamp. The roof of this box\r\n  forms part of the floor of the incubation chamber and from it a main\r\n  flue (F) and four smaller ones (F´) pass upwards through the roof of\r\n  the incubator and discharge to the exterior. Fresh air passes in to\r\n  the incubator through two tubular channels (A and A´) on either side\r\n  of the heating box and escapes through a hole in the roof, which\r\n  serves at the same time as a passage for one of the rods (D) in\r\n  connexion with the temperature regulating apparatus.\r\n\r\n  This apparatus (T) consists of a glass tube of ½ in. bore, and which\r\n  is bent into the form of a circle of 5 in. diameter. The tube is\r\n  fastened to a wooden disk, which rotates upon a pivot and in so doing\r\n  operates a vertical rod (D), which in its turn works the cap (V) which\r\n  covers the orifice of the main flue. The tube is partly filled with\r\n  mercury and is closed at one end. At this end there is contained some\r\n  spirit. As the temperature rises, this expands and pushes the mercury\r\n  column farther along the tube. The equilibrium of the position of rest\r\n  is thus disturbed, and the wooden disk consequently rotates, carrying\r\n  with it the vertical arm, the downward movement of which raises the\r\n  cap (V) of the flue. The temperature at which it is desired that this\r\n  valve shall uncover the flue, can be adjusted within the necessary\r\n  limits by sliding the weight (W) along the horizontal arm and by the\r\n  amount of mercury present in the bent tube. The air of the incubation\r\n  chamber is rendered sufficiently moist by the evaporation of water in\r\n  the vessel (G).\r\n\r\n  In the Cornell incubator (New York) more personal attention is\r\n  required than in other forms, since the ventilation of the egg-chamber\r\n  is not wholly automatic but is regulated according to the results of\r\n  observation. The great difficulty in ventilation is the proper\r\n  combination of fresh air and moisture. The Cornell Incubator Company\r\n  has endeavoured to obviate this difficulty by carrying out a series of\r\n  observations on the rate at which evaporation occurs in incubating\r\n  eggs under natural conditions. The rate of evaporation is measured by\r\n  the size of the air-space within the egg-shell at successive days.\r\n  This they have ascertained, and with their incubators they furnish a\r\n  book of instructions in which diagrams showing the size of the air\r\n  space on the 1st, 5th, 10th, 14th and 18th days are given. Examination\r\n  of the eggs should therefore be made every two or three days, and the\r\n  result compared with the diagrams. The incubator is provided with an\r\n  adjustable ventilator and this should be so arranged that evaporation\r\n  is neither too great nor too little. The ventilator should never be\r\n  wholly closed, and if when closed to its minimum evaporation is still\r\n  too great, then water should be placed in the moisture pans. In all\r\n  cases lukewarm water should be placed in these on the 18th day and the\r\n  ventilating slide opened wide.\r\n\r\n  It will thus be seen that in this machine there is an attempt to do\r\n  away with the addition of water to the incubator drawer during the\r\n  greater part of the period of incubation, and to rely upon the aqueous\r\n  vapour naturally present in the atmosphere. This attempt is based upon\r\n  the fact that water vapour is lighter than air, and will therefore\r\n  rise to the top in any enclosed volume of air. If the direction of the\r\n  ventilating current is downwards in the incubation chamber, and if it\r\n  is slow enough, it is thought that the water vapour will be sifted out\r\n  and tend to accumulate to a sufficient extent in the chamber. In the\r\n  Cornell incubator consequently the ventilating current passes first\r\n  upward through an external heater in order to warm it, whence it is\r\n  then deflected downwards into the egg-chamber and diffuses through its\r\n  perforated bottom. Then it passes along a space beneath the chamber\r\n  into a space in the left-hand wall of the incubator and out to the\r\n  exterior through an adjustable and graduated ventilating slide.\r\n\r\n  These incubators are hot-air machines, and the hot-air chamber is\r\n  situated above the egg-drawer and is traversed by several flues\r\n  opening out from a main one. The temperature regulating apparatus\r\n  appears to be similar to that of Hearson's machine and operates by a\r\n  thermostat, which through the agency of levers opens or closes a valve\r\n  over the main flue.\r\n\r\n  The Westmeria incubators (Leighton Buzzard) are of two patterns. One\r\n  type is built on the hot-air principle and the other on the hot-water\r\n  system. In both forms the heated air from the heating surfaces is\r\n  deflected down on the eggs and escapes through the perforated bottom\r\n  of the egg-drawer. The inlet air is first warmed by contact with the\r\n  main flue. The thermostat is similar to that in the Hillier machine\r\n  (fig. 7) and consists of a coil mounted on an axis, round which it can\r\n  rotate. The coil is filled with mercury and is closed at one end.\r\n  Between this end and the mercury column is a short column of air. By\r\n  expansion of the air under a rising temperature, the mercury column is\r\n  displaced and brings about a rotation of the disk to which the coiled\r\n  tube containing it is attached. This rotation raises the cap over the\r\n  main flue.\r\n\r\n  All the incubators so far described have been constructed with the\r\n  idea of obtaining as nearly as possible a uniform temperature. But in\r\n  E. S. Renwick's incubator (America) no attempt is made to obtain\r\n  uniformity in temperature. On the other hand, it is designed to give a\r\n  periodical oscillation from one extreme to the other of a limited\r\n  range, about 3°, of temperature. This is accomplished by means of a\r\n  thermostatic bar made of plates of brass and vulcanite fastened\r\n  together. This is connected with a clockwork and detent arrangement,\r\n  which simultaneously opens a valve and actuates the lamp flame. The\r\n  temperature falls to the lower limit of its range before the\r\n  thermostatic bar is sufficiently bent to set the clockwork arrangement\r\n  operating in the reverse direction, by which the valve is closed and\r\n  the lamp flame increased. The temperature then rises to the higher\r\n  limit, when the bending of the thermostatic bar again releases the\r\n  detent and the clockwork opens the valve and reduces the flame.\r\n\r\n  The incubator is said to succeed well. It also possesses a mechanical\r\n  arrangement by which all the eggs can be periodically turned on\r\n  rollers at once.\r\n\r\n  _Size._--The incubators which have been described are of relatively\r\n  small size, and the numbers of eggs which they can incubate are\r\n  strictly limited. For commercial purposes, however, operations of a\r\n  much larger magnitude are desirable and necessary. And there can be no\r\n  doubt that for these purposes the incubators of the future will be of\r\n  great size and will contain from 15,000 to 30,000 eggs or more at a\r\n  time. Already, at Aratoma Farm, Stamford, New York State, there is\r\n  established a large incubation room, containing several thousands of\r\n  eggs, and in which the heat regulation is controlled in part by the\r\n  personal efforts of attendants. It constitutes almost a complete\r\n  return, with added accessories, to the methods of the Egyptians, and\r\n  to those of John Champion.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bacteriological Incubators._\r\n\r\nThese differ from bird Incubators in that the heating surface of the\r\nincubation chamber generally surrounds all sides of it and there is, as\r\na rule, no special arrangement for bringing about a more or less humid\r\ncondition of the contained air. In some forms there is an arrangement to\r\nensure a continuous supply of fresh and moist air, but in the majority\r\nthe incubation chamber obtains its supply of fresh air vicariously. In\r\nsome forms the chamber of the incubator is heated by a warm water tank\r\nof a simple kind, which extends round all its sides. But in other forms\r\na series of tubes or flues passes through the water in this tank and\r\nthus simulates in principle the tube boiler. This latter form utilizes\r\nthe heat of the flame to a greater degree than the former kind. In yet\r\nother forms the incubation chamber is heated by warm air chambers which\r\nsurround it or flues which traverse it. Most bacteriological incubators\r\nare square or rectangular in form, but some bacteriologists prefer\r\ncylindrical forms, presumably on account of the ratio of volume to\r\nsurface in connexion with the water tank.\r\n\r\n  One of the best known and most generally used of the cylindrical and\r\n  water-tank kind is that of Dr d'Arsonval. It consists of two copper\r\n  cylinders (fig. 8 C and C´), each terminating in a cone below. Between\r\n  the cylinders is a wide interspace, in order that a large volume of\r\n  water may be contained. This interspace therefore constitutes the\r\n  water-tank of the incubator. The upper orifice of the inner cylinder\r\n  is closed by a movable double lid, which contains an interspace filled\r\n  with water. The outer cylinder has an oblique form at its upper end\r\n  and is permanently closed. The result attained by this slope of the\r\n  lid of the outer cylinder is that the water tank, which is fed from\r\n  the highest point, becomes completely filled. The aperture at the\r\n  highest point of the outer cylinder is plugged with a caoutchouc plug\r\n  and through a perforation in this a glass tube (T) is placed. In the\r\n  side of the outer cylinder below this, there is a wide and rimmed\r\n  aperture, to which a gas regulator of special construction is fixed.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 8.--D'Arsonval Incubator.]\r\n\r\n  This regulator was designed by Théophile Schloesing, and consists of a\r\n  brass box, supplied with a rim (L) which fits on to the corresponding\r\n  rim (L´) on the aperture of the incubator. Stretching across the\r\n  orifice thus connecting the brass box of the regulator with the\r\n  water-tank of the incubator is a thin india-rubber diaphragm (D). At\r\n  its outer end a perforated cap (R) screws on to the brass box. Through\r\n  the perforation the inlet gas tube passes (I); the outlet gas tube (O)\r\n  leaves the brass box below and passes direct to the gas burners. The\r\n  inlet gas tube is fitted at its inner end with a sliding flanged\r\n  collar (F), which is kept pressed against the rubber diaphragm by a\r\n  spiral spring. Just behind the collar the inlet tube is perforated by\r\n  a small hole, so that the gas supply is never wholly cut off, even\r\n  though the rubber diaphragm completely occludes the inner aperture of\r\n  the pipe.\r\n\r\n  The mode of working of the regulator is as follows: when the water\r\n  tank of the incubator is filled with distilled or rain water at the\r\n  temperature required, it presses upon the india-rubber diaphragm with\r\n  a certain degree of pressure. By screwing the inlet pipe in or out, as\r\n  required, it can be so adjusted that the diaphragm does not occlude\r\n  its inner aperture, and consequently the full volume of gas can pass\r\n  through to the burners below. The temperature of the water in the\r\n  water-tank therefore begins to rise, and in consequence the volume of\r\n  the water to increase. This results in the water rising up into the\r\n  tube (T), and therefore the dynamical pressure which is exercised by\r\n  the water upon every part of the two cylinders of the incubator and\r\n  consequently also upon the india-rubber diaphragm of the regulator is\r\n  increased. As this pressure increases, the diaphragm becomes bulged\r\n  outwardly and reduces the volume of gas passing through the aperture\r\n  of the inlet pipe. At a certain point, of course, the diaphragm\r\n  completely occludes the aperture, and the gas supply is wholly cut\r\n  off, except for the very small hole, forming a by-pass, in the pipe,\r\n  behind the collar. This hole is just sufficiently big to allow the\r\n  minimum amount of gas requisite to keep the flames burning to pass\r\n  through. The temperature will, therefore, begin to fall, the volume of\r\n  water to decrease with its resulting descent from the glass tube (T)\r\n  and consequent decrease in the dynamical pressure of the water upon\r\n  the diaphragm. The latter therefore retracts away from the aperture of\r\n  the inlet tube, and more gas consequently passes through; the flames\r\n  again increase in size and the temperature rises once more. And as\r\n  soon as the volume of water, owing to the rising temperature, has\r\n  increased to the extent correlated with the temperature at which the\r\n  apparatus has been set to work, it will have risen once more in the\r\n  tube (T), and the gas will be again cut off. The three burners are\r\n  placed upon a support that can be moved vertically up or down along\r\n  one of the legs of the incubator. The flames are protected from\r\n  draughts by mica chimneys. Ventilation is provided by an adjustable\r\n  valve (V´) in the cylindrical termination of the incubator at its\r\n  lower end, and by tubular orifices, also fitted with valves (V) in the\r\n  lid above.\r\n\r\n  The incubator is very reliable and may be worked within very narrow\r\n  limits of variation, provided that the gas-supply be regulated by a\r\n  gas-pressure regulator, that the height of the water in the tube (T)\r\n  is maintained by daily additions of a few drops of distilled water,\r\n  and that the incubator itself be protected from draughts.\r\n\r\n  Another form of d'Arsonval incubator has a glass door in the side of\r\n  it and a slightly modified form of the heat regulator.\r\n\r\n  Other cylindrical forms of incubators are made by Lequeux of Paris. In\r\n  one of these the heat regulator is a bimetallic thermostat, the\r\n  movements of which are enlarged by a simple series of levers, so that\r\n  a valve can be automatically adjusted to allow more or less heat from\r\n  the flame to pass through the heating flue.\r\n\r\n  In another form there is a movable interior, and an arrangement for\r\n  keeping the air in the incubation chamber saturated. It is governed by\r\n  a bimetallic thermostat of the Roux type.\r\n\r\n  In Dr Hüppe's improved form of his incubator, which is approximately\r\n  square in form, the double-walled water tank is completely surrounded\r\n  externally by an air chamber, which is heated by the passage through\r\n  it of the products of combustion of the two flames. The heated gases\r\n  escape through an adjustable aperture at the top. In the earlier form\r\n  the water tank was traversed by a number of hot-air flues, and there\r\n  was consequently no external hot-air chamber. There is an arrangement\r\n  of tubes for ventilation, which allow fresh air to enter the lower\r\n  part of the incubation chamber and to leave it at the top. The\r\n  incoming air is warmed before it enters. The walls are made of\r\n  lead-coated steel, and externally the incubator is covered with\r\n  linoleum. In the more expensive forms the inner chamber is of copper.\r\n  The temperature may be controlled by any of the simpler mercury\r\n  thermostats described below.\r\n\r\n  Dr Babes' incubator is somewhat similar, but the water tank is not\r\n  surrounded by a hot-air chamber. Instead it is traversed by a number\r\n  of vertical flues through which the heated gases from the flames pass.\r\n  Ventilation is provided for and there is an apparatus for controlling\r\n  the humidity of the air in the incubation chamber. As in Hüppe's\r\n  incubator, the bottom is conical in form. The walls of the incubator\r\n  are of lead-coated steel, and externally they are covered with\r\n  linoleum; there are two doors, an inner one of glass and an outer one\r\n  of metal. The temperature may be controlled as in Hüppe's incubator.\r\n\r\n  Hearson has designed several forms of bacteriological (biological)\r\n  incubators, made by Chas. Hearson & Co., Ltd. Some are heated by a\r\n  petroleum lamp and others by a gas flame. In the form heated by a\r\n  lamp, for which, however, gas can be substituted, the incubation\r\n  chamber is surrounded by a water tank (fig. 9, A) and the lowest part\r\n  of this is traversed by an in-going (L) and an out-going flue. The\r\n  mode of regulation of the temperature is by means of a thermostat\r\n  which operates the movements of a cap (F) over the main flue (V), and\r\n  it is identical in its chief features with the method employed in the\r\n  chicken incubator. The thermostat (S) is situated in the upper part of\r\n  the incubation chamber.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 9.--Hearson's Bacteriological Incubator. (Heated\r\n  by a petroleum lamp.)]\r\n\r\n  In the other form (fig. 10) for which gas is used exclusively, there\r\n  are no flues traversing the water tank. This latter is heated from its\r\n  conical floor by a burner beneath the incubator. The heat regulation\r\n  is controlled by a thermostat of the same nature as in the form of\r\n  incubator just described, but instead of operating by lowering or\r\n  raising a cap over a main flue, so as to direct the heated gases\r\n  either through the water tank if the temperature is falling, or\r\n  through the main flue directly to the exterior if it is rising, it\r\n  actuates a gas-governor, so that the flame itself is increased or\r\n  diminished in size according to the needs of the incubator. The\r\n  gas-governor (fig. 11) is fixed to the roof of the incubator. The\r\n  horizontal arm (D) is the same that raises the cap (fig. 9, F) over\r\n  the flue in the other form of incubator, but in this case it simply\r\n  acts as the bearer of the sliding weight. Beyond its fulcrum (fig. 11,\r\n  G) it is continued into a detent-like spur (B) which pushes down upon\r\n  a button attached to a rubber diaphragm, when the thermostat within\r\n  the incubator is expanded by a rise in temperature. The button thus\r\n  forced down, more or less completely closes the inlet gas aperture,\r\n  and so reduces or cuts off the gas supply to the flame. There is a\r\n  by-pass to prevent the flame from going out completely, and the size\r\n  of this can be adjusted by the screw (S). Hearson's incubators have\r\n  the reputation of very accurate performance and practically need no\r\n  attention for months, or even years.\r\n\r\n  Schribaux's incubator is a hot-air form. Its walls are of metal, but\r\n  it is cased externally with wood, which serves as the insulating\r\n  material. Against the inner metal wall of the incubator, and upon its\r\n  internal surface, there are disposed a number of vertical tubes, which\r\n  open through the roof above into a common discharging funnel. Below,\r\n  at the bottom of the incubator they receive the heated gases of\r\n  several burners, which as they pass through them radiate their heat\r\n  evenly throughout the incubation chamber. In each side wall, at the\r\n  bottom of the chamber, is an adjustable ventilating valve.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 10.--Hearson's Bacteriological Incubator (heated\r\n  by a gas flame).]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 11.--Gas-governor.]\r\n\r\n  Inside the incubation chamber, and situated against its left-hand\r\n  wall, is a U-shaped bimetallic thermostat of the Roux design,\r\n  described below. This very accurately controls the temperature of the\r\n  incubator.\r\n\r\n  (c) _Cool Incubators._--In bacteriological laboratories there are two\r\n  standards of temperature, one chiefly for the culture of\r\n  non-pathogenic organisms and the other for the pathogenic forms. The\r\n  first standard of temperature lies between 18° and 20° C., and the\r\n  second between 35° and 38° C. But in hot countries, and even in\r\n  temperate regions during the summer, the external temperature is much\r\n  higher than the former of these two standards, with the result that\r\n  many cultures, especially the gelatine ones, are spoiled. The\r\n  difficulty is often partially overcome by running cold water through\r\n  the incubator.\r\n\r\n  Hearson, however, has constructed a \"cool biological incubator,\" in\r\n  which by an ingenious device the expansion or contraction of the\r\n  thermostatic capsule deflects a horizontal pipe (C) (fig. 12), through\r\n  which cold water from an ordinary tap is kept running, in one of two\r\n  directions. If it is deflected so as to open into the tube (D), the\r\n  cold water passes into the tank (F), where it is warmed by a gas\r\n  flame, and thence it passes into the water-jacket of the incubator. If\r\n  it is deflected so as to open into the pipe (E), it then runs through\r\n  the ice tank (B), containing broken ice, before passing through the\r\n  water-jacket of the incubator. If it poured into neither of these\r\n  pipes it then simply passes out through the pipe (H) to the waste pipe\r\n  (N). By this device the temperature of the incubator can be kept\r\n  constant at any desired point, even though it may be some 30° to 40°\r\n  C. below that of the external air.\r\n\r\n  Dr Roux has also designed an incubator which can be maintained at a\r\n  constant temperature below that of the surrounding air. This also\r\n  depends upon the principle of carrying water through an ice-safe,\r\n  which then traverses a pipe within the incubator chamber before\r\n  passing into the water-jacket of the machine. The heat-regulating\r\n  apparatus is a bimetallic thermostat. The incubator is made by Lequeux\r\n  of Paris.\r\n\r\n  The most recent forms of all kinds of incubators, made by Hearson of\r\n  London, Lequeux of Paris and Lautenschläger of Berlin are both heated\r\n  and regulated by electricity. The heating is accomplished by electric\r\n  radiators.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 12.--Hearson's Cool Biological Incubator.]\r\n\r\n  In Hearson's machines the regulation of the temperature is brought\r\n  about by the breaking or making of the electric current, through the\r\n  lifting or depression of a platinum contact, actuated by the expansion\r\n  or contraction of the thermostatic capsule.\r\n\r\n  In Roux's apparatus, made by Lequeux, the make and break is attained\r\n  by the movement of one limb of a bimetallic thermostat, and in some\r\n  forms a resistance coil and rheostat are placed in the circuit.\r\n\r\n  At the Pasteur Institute in Paris, and at other large laboratories in\r\n  France, the bacteriological incubator is raised to the dimensions of a\r\n  room. In the centre of this room is a large boiler heated by\r\n  gas-burners, the fumes from which pass through a large flue to the\r\n  outside. The flame of the burners is regulated by a bimetallic\r\n  thermostat. The gas by-pass can be regulated by an attendant. The\r\n  cultures are contained in vessels placed on shelves, which are ranged\r\n  round the side of the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Human Incubators._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.--Tarnier's Incubator.]\r\n\r\nThe first incubator designed for rearing children who are too weak to\r\nsurvive under normal conditions, or who are prematurely born, is that of\r\nDr Tarnier. It was constructed in 1880 and was first used at the Paris\r\nMaternity Hospital. Its form is that of a rectangular box measuring 65 ×\r\n30 × 50 centimetres (fig. 13). It is divided into an upper and lower\r\nchamber; the former contains the infant, while the latter serves as a\r\nheating chamber, and in reality is simply a modified water-tank. The\r\npartition (P) which divides the incubator into two chambers does not\r\nextend the whole length of it, so that the upper and lower chambers are\r\nat one end of the apparatus in communication with each other. It is\r\nthrough this passage that the heated air from the lower chamber passes\r\ninto the upper one containing the infant. The narrow bottom chamber C\r\nserves to prevent loss of heat from the base of the water-bottles. The\r\noutside air is admitted into the lower chamber at the opposite end,\r\nthrough an aperture (A), and passing over a series of bottles (B)\r\ncontaining warm water, becomes heated. The air is rendered adequately\r\nmoist by means of a wetted sponge (S) which is placed at the entrance of\r\nthe lower chamber into the upper. The warmed and moistened air is\r\ndetermined in its direction by the position of the outlet aperture (O),\r\nwhich is situated above and just behind the head of the infant. It\r\ncontains a helix valve (H) and the rotation of this is an indication\r\nthat the air is circulating within the incubator.\r\n\r\nThe child is kept under observation by means of a sliding glass door (G)\r\nsituated in the upper or roof wall of the incubator. Immediately beneath\r\nthis, and attached to one of the side walls, is a thermometer (T) which\r\nrecords the temperature of the air in the infant-chamber. The\r\ntemperature should be maintained at 31° to 32° C. The precise limit of\r\ntemperature must of course be determined by the condition of the child;\r\nthe smaller and weaker it is, the higher the temperature must be.\r\n\r\nThe warm water vessels contain three-quarters of a pint of water and\r\nfour of them are sufficient to maintain the required temperature,\r\nprovided that the external air does not fall below 16° C. The vessels\r\nare withdrawn and replaced through an entrance to the lower chamber, and\r\nwhich can be opened or closed by a sliding door (D).\r\n\r\nThe walls of the incubator, with the exception of the glass sliding\r\ndoor, are made of wood 25 millimetres thick.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus appears to have been successful, if by success is\r\nunderstood the indiscriminate saving of life apart from all other\r\nconsiderations, since the mortality of infants under 2000 grammes has\r\nbeen reduced by about 30%, and about 45% of children who are prematurely\r\nborn are saved.\r\n\r\nDr Tarnier's apparatus requires constant attention, and the water in the\r\nwarm water vessels needs renewing sufficiently often. It is not provided\r\nwith a temperature regulator and consequently fluctuations of internal\r\ntemperature, due to external thermal variations, are liable to occur.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.--Hearson's \"Thermostatic Nurse.\"]\r\n\r\nIn Hearson's Thermostatic Nurse these drawbacks are to a large extent\r\nobviated. This \"Nurse\" consists fundamentally of an application of the\r\narrangements for heating and moistening the air and for regulating the\r\ntemperature of Hearson's chick incubator to Dr Tarnier's human\r\nincubator. As in this latter form, there are two chambers (fig. 14), an\r\nupper (A) and a lower (B), connected with each other in the same way as\r\nin Tarnier's apparatus. The upper chamber contains the infant, but the\r\nlower is not a heating but a moistening chamber. Through apertures (M)\r\nin the bottom of the lower chamber, the external air passes through, and\r\nas in the chick incubator it then passes through perforations in the\r\ninner cylinder of a water tray (O) and thence over the surface of the\r\nwater in the tray, through a sheet of wet canvas, to the chamber itself.\r\nHence it passes to the infant chamber and ultimately leaves this through\r\na series of perforations round the top. The air in both chambers is\r\nheated by a warm-water tank. This tank forms the partition which divides\r\nthe incubator into upper and lower chambers and is made of metal.\r\nThrough the water contained in it, an incoming (R) and an outgoing (R)\r\nto the left flue, continuous with each other, pass. These two flues are\r\nrelated to each other as in the chick incubator (see above) and the\r\ninlet flue is heated in the same way and the outlet flue discharges\r\nsimilarly. The heat-regulating apparatus is identical with that in the\r\nchick incubator, and the thermostatic capsule (S) is placed in the upper\r\nchamber, near the head of the infant.\r\n\r\nThe child is placed in a basket which has perforated walls, and is open\r\nabove. The basket rests upon two shallow supports (D) situated on the\r\nupper surface of the water-tank partition. The child is kept under\r\nobservation through a glass door in the upper or roof-wall of the\r\nincubator.\r\n\r\nIn Great Britain this apparatus is in use at various hospitals and\r\nworkhouses throughout the country, and provided there is no great\r\nfluctuation of barometric pressure, it maintains a uniform temperature.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thermo-Regulators or Thermostats._\r\n\r\nCertain special forms of thermo-regulators, adapted to the requirements\r\nof the particular incubators to which they are attached, have already\r\nbeen described. It remains now to describe other forms which are of more\r\ngeneral application. Only those kinds will be described which are\r\napplicable to incubators. The special forms used for investigations in\r\nphysical-chemistry are not described. There are various types of\r\nthermo-regulators, all of which fall into one of two classes. Either\r\nthey act through the expansion of a solid, or through that of a liquid.\r\nThey are so adjusted, that, at a certain temperature, the expansion of\r\nthe material chosen causes the gas supply to be nearly completely cut\r\noff. The gas flame is prevented from being wholly extinguished by means\r\nof a small by-pass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.--Page's Thermostat.]\r\n\r\n  We will first describe those which act through the expansion of a\r\n  liquid. A very efficient and cheap form is that described by F. J. M.\r\n  Page in the _Journal of the Chemical Society_ for 1876. The regulator\r\n  consists of a glass bulb (fig. 15 B), continuous above with a tubular\r\n  limb (L). At the upper part of the limb is a lateral tubular arm (A)\r\n  which bends downwards and constitutes the outlet pipe. At the upper\r\n  extremity of the limb there is a short and much wider tube (T), the\r\n  lower end of which slides upwards or downwards along it. The upper end\r\n  of this wider tube is closed by a cork and through a perforation in\r\n  this a very small glass tube (G) passes downwards into the limb of the\r\n  regulator to a point a short distance below the exit of the outlet\r\n  tube. The exact height of the lower aperture of the small tube can be\r\n  varied by sliding the wider tube up or down along the limb. The\r\n  by-pass (P) consists of a transverse connexion between the inlet and\r\n  outlet gas pipes, and the amount of gas which travels through the\r\n  short circuit thus formed is regulated by means of a stopcock. The\r\n  by-pass, however, can be formed, as suggested by Schäfer (_Practical\r\n  Histology_, 1877, p. 80), by making an extremely small hole in the\r\n  small inlet tube, a little way above its lower extremity. But unless\r\n  this hole be small enough, too much gas will be allowed to pass, and a\r\n  sufficiently low temperature therefore unattainable. The regulator is\r\n  filled with mercury until the top of the column reaches within ½ in.\r\n  of the exit of the outlet tube, the bulb is placed in the incubator\r\n  chamber, and gas is allowed to pass through it. By pushing down the\r\n  inner inlet tube (G) until its aperture is immersed beneath the\r\n  mercury, the gas supply is cut off, with the exception of that passing\r\n  through the by-pass. The stopcock is now turned until only the\r\n  smallest flame exists. The inlet pipe is then raised again above the\r\n  mercury, and the flame consequently increases in size. The temperature\r\n  of the incubator gradually rises, and when the desired degree is\r\n  reached, the inlet tube is pushed down until the end is just beneath\r\n  the surface of the mercury. The gas supply is thus cut off at the\r\n  desired temperature. If the temperature of the incubator falls, the\r\n  mercury contracts, the aperture of the inlet tube is uncovered, the\r\n  gas supply is renewed and the flame increased. The temperature will\r\n  then rise until the required point is reached, when the gas supply\r\n  will again be cut off. A uniform temperature which oscillates within a\r\n  range of half a degree is thus attained.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 16.--Reichert's Thermo-Regulator.]\r\n\r\n  Reichert's Thermo-regulator (fig. 16) is another simple and also an\r\n  earlier form. The stem (S) of the regulator is enlarged above and\r\n  receives a hollow T-piece (P), the vertical limb of which fits\r\n  accurately into the enlarged end of the stem, and one end of the\r\n  cross-limb receives the inlet gas pipe; the other end is closed. The\r\n  vertical limb of the T-piece is narrowed down at its lower extremity\r\n  and opens by a small aperture. Above this terminal aperture is a\r\n  lateral one of the smallest size. From the enlarged end of the stem\r\n  there passes out a lateral arm (A) which is connected with the outlet\r\n  pipe to the burner, and lower down another arm (L), which is closed at\r\n  its outer extremity by a screw (R), is also attached. The stem and\r\n  lower arm are filled with mercury and the bulb of the stem is placed\r\n  in the incubator chamber, and gas allowed to pass. When the desired\r\n  temperature is reached, the mercury in the stem is forced upwards\r\n  until it closes the aperture of the T-piece, by screwing in the screw\r\n  (R) of the lower lateral arm (L).\r\n\r\n  There are several modifications of Reichert's original form. In one of\r\n  these the screw arrangement in the lower arm is replaced by a piston\r\n  rod working in a narrow bore of a vertically bent limb of the arm. In\r\n  another form, the other end of the cross bar of the T-piece is open\r\n  and leads through a stopcock to a third arm, which opens into the\r\n  enlarged upper end of the stem opposite to the outlet arm (A); this\r\n  modification acts as an adjustable by-pass and replaces the minute\r\n  aperture in the side of the vertical limb of the T-piece.\r\n\r\n  In Babes' modification the gas supply is cut off, not by the occlusion\r\n  by the rising mercury of the aperture of the T-piece, but by a\r\n  floating beaded wire-valve. The aperture of the vertical limb of the\r\n  T-piece (P) is traversed by a fine wire which is enlarged at both ends\r\n  into a bead-like knob. The wire fits loosely in the aperture and not\r\n  only therefore works easily in it, but allows gas to freely pass. When\r\n  the lower bead-like knob, however, is raised by the expansion of the\r\n  mercury, the gas supply is cut off by the bead being carried up\r\n  against the orifice.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 17.--Cuccatti's Thermo-Regulator.]\r\n\r\n  Cuccatti's thermo-regulator (fig. 17) is an exceedingly simple and\r\n  ingenious form. The stem (S) of the regulator is enlarged below into a\r\n  bulb, while above it divides into a V. The two limbs of the V are of\r\n  course traversed by a canal and they are connected above by a tubular\r\n  cross bar (C). In the middle of this there is a stopcock situated\r\n  between the two points where the bar joins the limbs of the V. One end\r\n  of the cross-tube serves as an inlet and the other as an outlet for\r\n  the gas. The stopcock serves as an adjustable by-pass. About an inch\r\n  below the point where the two limbs of the V join the stem, the bore\r\n  of the latter is enlarged, and it leads into a lateral arm (A),\r\n  containing a screw (R), similar to the corresponding arm in Reichert's\r\n  regulator. When the mercury in the bulb and stem expands, it rises,\r\n  and reaching the point when the two limbs of the V meet occludes the\r\n  orifice to both and thus cuts off the gas supply, except that which is\r\n  passing through the by-pass of the stopcock. The temperature at which\r\n  this occlusion will take place can be determined by the screw in the\r\n  lateral arm. The more this is screwed in, the lower will be the\r\n  temperature at which the gas becomes cut off, and vice versa.\r\n\r\n  Bunsen's, Kemp's and Muenke's regulators are in reality of the nature\r\n  of air-thermometers, and act by the expansion and contraction of air,\r\n  which raises or lowers respectively a column of mercury; this in its\r\n  turn results in the occlusion or opening of the gas aperture. Such\r\n  forms, however, are subject to the influence of barometric pressure\r\n  and an alteration of 0.5 in. of the barometer column may result in the\r\n  variation of the temperature to as much as 2°.\r\n\r\n  Lothar Meyer's regulator is described in the _Berichte of the German\r\n  Chemical Society_, 1883, p. 1089. It is essentially a liquid\r\n  thermometer, the mercury column being raised by the expansion of a\r\n  liquid of low boiling-point. The liquid replaces the air in Bunsen's\r\n  and other similar forms. The boiling-point of this liquid must be\r\n  below the temperature required as constant.\r\n\r\n  The solid forms of thermostats are constructed upon the same principle\r\n  as the compensation balance of a watch or the compensation pendulum of\r\n  a clock. This depends upon the fact that the co-efficient of expansion\r\n  is different for different metals. It therefore results that if two\r\n  bars of different metals are fastened together along their lengths\r\n  (fig. 18, Z and ST) with the same rise of temperature one of these\r\n  will expand or lengthen more than the other. And since both are\r\n  fastened together and must therefore accommodate themselves within the\r\n  same linear area, it follows that the compound rod must bend into a\r\n  curved form, in order that the bar of greater expansion may occupy the\r\n  surface of greater length, i.e. the convex one. Conversely, when the\r\n  temperature falls, the greater degree of contraction will be in the\r\n  same bar, and the surface occupied by it will tend to become the\r\n  concave one. If, then, one end of this compound rod be fixed and the\r\n  other free, the latter end will describe a backward and forward\r\n  movement through an arc of a circle, which will correspond with the\r\n  oscillations of temperature. This movement can be utilized by means of\r\n  simple mechanical arrangements, to open or close the stopcock of a gas\r\n  supply pipe.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 18.--Dr Roux's Thermostat (straight bar).]\r\n\r\n  In the construction of this type of thermostat it is obvious that the\r\n  greater the difference in the co-efficient of expansion of the two\r\n  metals used, the larger will be the amplitude of the movement\r\n  obtained. Steel and zinc are two metals which satisfy this condition.\r\n  The co-efficient of steel is the lowest of all metals and is\r\n  comparable in its degree with that of glass. Substances which are not\r\n  metals, such as vulcanite and porcelain, are sometimes used to replace\r\n  steel, as the substance of low co-efficient of expansion.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 19.--Dr Roux's Thermostat (U-shaped bar).]\r\n\r\n  The bimetallic thermostat most commonly employed is one of the two\r\n  forms designed by Dr Roux. In one of these forms the compound bar is\r\n  straight (fig. 18) and in the other it is U-shaped (fig. 19). In the\r\n  former type the bar itself is enclosed in a tube (T) of metal, the\r\n  wall of which is perforated. Towards the open end of this tube the gas\r\n  box or case (C) is fixed. In the U-shape form it is attached to the\r\n  outer surface (zinc) of one limb of the bar. The gas box is capable of\r\n  adjustment with respect to its distance from the bar, by means of a\r\n  screw (S) and a spiral spring (SP), which moves the box outwards or\r\n  inwards along a rod (R). This adjustment enables the degree of\r\n  temperature at which it is desired that the gas shall be cut off to be\r\n  fixed accurately, and within a certain more or less extended range.\r\n  The inlet and the outlet pipe are disconnected from each other in the\r\n  gas box by means of a piston-like rod (P) and valve (V), which slides\r\n  backwards and forwards in the tubular part (T) of the box, from which\r\n  the outlet pipe emerges. When the valve (V) rests upon the edge of\r\n  this box, the gas is completely cut off from passing through the\r\n  outlet pipe, with the exception of that which passes through an\r\n  exceedingly small aperture (B), serving as a by-pass. This is just\r\n  large enough to allow sufficient gas to pass to maintain a small\r\n  flame. The piston-like rod and valve, when free, is kept pressed\r\n  outwards by means of a spiral spring. This ensures that the valve\r\n  shall follow the movements of the compound bar. When this bar bends\r\n  towards the gas box owing to a fall of temperature, the valve is\r\n  pushed back away from the orifice and gas in increasing quantity\r\n  passes through. The temperature of the incubator begins then to rise,\r\n  and the zinc bar (Z) expanding more than the steel one (ST), the bar\r\n  bends outwards and the valve once more cuts off the gas supply.\r\n\r\n  (d) _Gas-Pressure Regulators._--The liquid form of thermo-regulators\r\n  especially work with a greater degree of accuracy if they are combined\r\n  with some apparatus which controls the variations in gas pressure.\r\n  There are various forms of these regulators, most of which are figured\r\n  and sometimes partially described in the catalogues of various makers\r\n  of scientific instruments. It will suffice if we describe two forms,\r\n  one of which (that of Buddicom) can be made by a laboratory attendant\r\n  of average intelligence.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 20.--Buddicom's Gas Regulator.]\r\n\r\n  In R. A. Buddicom's gas regulator (fig. 20) the inlet (I) and outlet\r\n  (O) gas pipe open into a metal bell (B), the lower and open end of\r\n  which is immersed beneath water contained in a metal tray (T). The\r\n  bell is suspended upon the arm of a balance (B) and the other arm is\r\n  poised by a weight (W). This weight may be made of any convenient\r\n  material. In the original apparatus a test-tube partially filled with\r\n  mercury was used. The weight dips into one limb of a U-shaped glass\r\n  tube (U), which contains mercury. Into the other limb of this tube the\r\n  gas from the meter enters through a glass tube (G) which is held in\r\n  position by a well-fitting cork. The internal aperture of the tube (G)\r\n  is very oblique, and it rests just above the level of the mercury when\r\n  the instrument is finally adjusted. This adjustment is better made in\r\n  the morning when the gas pressure in the main is at its lowest. Just\r\n  above the internal aperture of the tube (G), a lateral tube (L) passes\r\n  out from the limb of the U and is connected with the inlet pipe (I) of\r\n  the bell. If the gas pressure rises, the bell (B) is raised and the\r\n  counter-poising weight (W) is proportionately lowered. This forces the\r\n  mercury up in the other limb of the U-tube and consequently diminishes\r\n  the size of the oblique orifice in the tube (G). Some of the gas is\r\n  thus cut off and the pressure maintained constant. Should the pressure\r\n  fall, the reverse processes occur, and more gas passes through the\r\n  orifice of G and consequently to the burner by the outlet tube (O).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 21.--Moitessier's Gas Regulator.]\r\n\r\n  Moitessier's regulator (fig. 21) is more complex, and needs more\r\n  skilled work in its construction. It consists of an outer and closed\r\n  cylinder (O), which is filled about half-way up with a mixture of\r\n  acid-free glycerine and distilled water in the proportion of two to\r\n  one respectively. Within the cylinder is a bell (B), the lower and\r\n  open end of which dips under the glycerine-water mixture. From the top\r\n  of the bell a vertical rod (R) passes up through an aperture in the\r\n  cover of the outer cylinder, and supports the weighted dish (D). The\r\n  inlet (I) and outlet (O) pipes enter the chamber of the bell above the\r\n  level of the glycerine-water mixture. The outlet tube is a simple one;\r\n  but the inlet tube is enlarged into a relatively capacious cylinder\r\n  (C), and its upper end is fitted with a cover which is perforated by\r\n  an aperture having a smooth surface and concave form. Into this\r\n  aperture an accurately fitting ball- or socket-valve (V) fits. The\r\n  ball-valve is supported by a suspension thread (T) from the roof of\r\n  the bell (B). The apparatus should be adjusted in the morning when the\r\n  pressure is low, and the dish (D) should be then so weighted that the\r\n  full amount of gas passes through. The size of the flame should then\r\n  be adjusted. Should the pressure increase, the bell (B) is raised and\r\n  with it the ball-valve (V). The aperture in the cover of the inlet\r\n  cylinder is consequently reduced and some of the gas cut off. When the\r\n  pressure falls again, the ball-valve is lowered and more gas passes\r\n  through. The relative pressure in the inlet and outlet pipes can be\r\n  read off on the manometer (M) placed on each of these tubes.\r\n\r\n  Levelling screws allow of the apparatus being horizontally adjusted.\r\n  The friction engendered by the working of the vertical rod (R) through\r\n  the aperture in the collar of the cylinder cover is reduced to a\r\n  minimum by the rod being made to slide upwards or downwards on three\r\n  vertical knife-edge ridges within the aperture of the collar.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--Charles A.

P. M.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINCUBUS (a Late Latin form of the classical _incubo_, a night-mare, from\r\n_incubare_, to lie upon, weigh down, brood), the name given in the\r\nmiddle ages to a male demon which was supposed to haunt women in their\r\nsleep, and to whose visits the birth of witches and demons was\r\nattributed. The female counterparts of these demons were called\r\n_succubae_. The word is also applied generally to an oppressive thing or\r\nperson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINCUMBENT (from Lat. _incumbere_, to lean, lie upon), a general term for\r\nthe holder (rector, vicar, curate in charge) of an ecclesiastical\r\nbenefice (see BENEFICE). In Scotland the title is generally confined to\r\nclergy of the Episcopal Church. The word in this application is peculiar\r\nto English. Du Cange (_Glossarium, s. v._ \"Incumbens\") says that the\r\n_Jurisconsulti_ use _incumbere_ in the sense of _obtinere_, _possidere_,\r\nbut the sense may be transferred from the general one of that which\r\nrests or is laid on one as a duty which is also found in post-classical\r\nLatin; to be \"diligently resident\" in a parish or benefice, has also\r\nbeen suggested as the source of the meaning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINCUNABULA, a Latin neuter-plural meaning \"swaddling-clothes,\" a\r\n\"cradle,\" \"birthplace,\" and so the beginning of anything, now curiously\r\nspecialized to denote books printed in the 15th century. Its use in this\r\nsense may have originated with the title of the first separately\r\npublished list of 15th-century books, Cornelius a Beughem's _Incunabula\r\ntypographiae_ (Amsterdam, 1688). The word is generally recognized all\r\nover Europe and has produced vernacular forms such as the French\r\nincunables, German _Inkunabeln_ (_Wiegendrucke_), Italian _incunaboli_,\r\nthough the anglicized _incunables_ is not yet fully accepted. If its\r\noriginal meaning had been regarded the application of the word would\r\nhave been confined to books printed before a much earlier date, such as\r\n1475, or to the first few printed in any country or town. By the end of\r\nthe 15th century book-production in the great centres of the trade, such\r\nas Venice, Lyons, Paris and Cologne, had already lost much of its\r\nprimitive character, and in many countries there is no natural\r\nhalting-place between 1490 and 1520 or later. The attractions of a round\r\ndate have prevailed, however, over these considerations, and the year\r\n1500 is taken as a halting-place, or more often a terminus, in all the\r\nchief works devoted to the registration and description of early printed\r\nbooks. The most important of these are (i.) Panzer's _Annales\r\ntypographici ab artis inventae origine ad annum MD._, printed in five\r\nvolumes at Nuremberg in 1793 and subsequently in 1803 carried on to 1536\r\nby six additional volumes; (ii.) Ham's _Repertorium bibliographicum in\r\nquo libri omnes ab arte typographica inventa usque ad annum MD. typis\r\nexpressi ordine alphabetico vel simpliciter enumerantur vel adcuratius,\r\nrecensentur_ (Stuttgart, 1826-1838). In Panzer's _Annales_ the first\r\nprinciple of division is that of the alphabetical order of the Latin\r\nnames of towns in which incunabula were printed, the books being\r\narranged under the towns by the years of publication. In Hain's\r\n_Repertorium_ the books are arranged under their authors' names, and it\r\nwas only in 1891 that an index of printers was added by Dr Konrad\r\nBurger. In 1898 Robert Proctor published an _Index to the Early Printed\r\nBooks in the British Museum: from the invention of printing to the year\r\nMD., with notes of those in the Bodleian Library_. In this work the\r\nbooks were arranged as far as possible chronologically under their\r\nprinters, the printers chronologically under the towns in which they\r\nworked, and the towns and countries chronologically in the order in\r\nwhich printing was introduced into them, the total number of books\r\nregistered being nearly ten thousand. Between 1898 and 1902 Dr W.\r\nCopinger published a _Supplement to Hain's Repertorium_, described as a\r\ncollection towards a new edition of that work, adding some seven\r\nthousand new entries to the sixteen thousand editions enumerated by\r\nHain. From the total of about twenty-three thousand incunabula thus\r\nregistered considerable deductions must be made for duplicate entries\r\nand undated editions which probably belong to the 16th century. On the\r\nother hand Dr Copinger's _Supplement_ had hardly appeared before\r\nadditional lists began to be issued registering books unknown both to\r\nhim and to Hain, and the new _Repertorium_, begun in 1905, under the\r\nauspices of the German government, seemed likely to register, on its\r\ncompletion, not fewer than thirty thousand different incunabula as\r\nextant either in complete copies or fragments.\r\n\r\nIn any attempt to estimate the extent to which the incunabula still in\r\nexistence represent the total output of the 15th-century presses, a\r\nsharp distinction must be drawn between the weightier and the more\r\nephemeral literature. Owing to the great religious and intellectual\r\nupheaval in the 16th century much of the literature previously current\r\nwent out of date, while the cumbrous early editions of books still read\r\nwere superseded by handier ones. Before this happened the heavier works\r\nhad found their way into countless libraries and here they reposed\r\npeacefully, only sharing the fate of the libraries themselves when these\r\nwere pillaged, or by a happier fortune amalgamated with other\r\ncollections in a larger library. The considerable number of copies of\r\nmany books for whose preservation no special reason can be found\r\nencourages a belief that the proportion of serious works now completely\r\nlost is not very high, except in the case of books of devotion whose\r\nhonourable destiny was to be worn to pieces by devout fingers. On the\r\nother hand, of the lighter literature in book-form, the cheap romances\r\nand catchpenny literature of all kinds, the destruction has been very\r\ngreat. Most of the broadsides and single sheets generally which have\r\nescaped have done so only by virtue of the 16th-century custom of using\r\nwaste of this kind as a substitute for wooden boards to stiffen\r\nbindings. Excluding these broadsides, &c., the total output of the\r\n15th-century presses in book form is not likely to have exceeded forty\r\nthousand editions. As to the size of the editions we know that the\r\nearliest printers at Rome favoured 225 copies, those at Venice 300. By\r\nthe end of the century these numbers had increased, but the soft metal\r\nin use then for types probably wore badly enough to keep down the size\r\nof editions, and an average of 500 copies, giving a possible total of\r\ntwenty million books put on the European market during the 15th century\r\nis probably as near an estimate as can be made.\r\n\r\nVery many incunabula contain no information as to when, where or by whom\r\nthey were printed, but the individuality of most of the early types as\r\ncompared with modern ones has enabled typographical detectives (of whom\r\nRobert Proctor, who died in 1903, was by far the greatest) to track most\r\nof them down. To facilitate this work many volumes of facsimiles have\r\nbeen published, the most important being K. Burger's _Monumenta\r\nGermaniae et Italiae Typographica_ (1892, &c.), J. W. Holtrop's\r\n_Monuments typographiques des Pays-Bas_ (1868), O. Thierry-Poux's\r\n_Premiers monuments de l'imprimerie en France au XV^e siècle_ (1890), K.\r\nHaebler's _Typographie ibérique du quinzième siècle_ (1901) and Gordon\r\nDuff's _Early English Printing_ (1896), the publications of the Type\r\nFacsimile Society (1700, &c.) and the _Woolley Facsimiles_, a collection\r\nof five hundred photographs, privately printed.\r\n\r\nIn his _Index to the Early Printed Books at the British Museum_ Proctor\r\nenumerated and described all the known types used by each printer, and\r\nhis descriptions have been usefully extended and made more precise by Dr\r\nHaebler in his _Typenrepertorium der Wiegendrucke_ (1905, &c.). With the\r\naid of these descriptions and of the facsimiles already mentioned it is\r\nusually possible to assign a newly discovered book with some certainty\r\nto the press from which it was issued and often to specify within a few\r\nweeks, or even days, the date at which it was finished.\r\n\r\nAs a result of these researches it is literally true that the output of\r\nthe 15th-century presses (excluding the ephemeral publications which\r\nhave very largely disappeared) is better known to students than that of\r\nany other period. Of original literature of any importance the\r\nhalf-century 1450-1500 was singularly barren, and the zeal with which\r\n15th-century books have been collected and studied has been criticized\r\nas excessive and misplaced. No doubt the minuteness with which it is\r\npossible to make an old book yield up its secrets has encouraged\r\nstudents to pursue the game for its own sake without any great\r\nconsideration of practical utility, but the materials which have thus\r\nbeen made available for the student of European culture are far from\r\ninsignificant. The competition among the 15th-century printers was very\r\ngreat and they clearly sent to press every book for which they could\r\nhope for a sale, undaunted by its bulk. Thus the great medieval\r\nencyclopaedia, the _Specula_ (_Speculum naturale_, _Speculum\r\nhistoriale_, _Speculum morale_, _Speculum doctrinale_) of Vincent de\r\nBeauvais went through two editions at Strassburg and found publishers\r\nand translators elsewhere, although it must have represented an outlay\r\nfrom which many modern firms would shrink. It would almost seem, indeed,\r\nas if some publishers specially affected very bulky works which, while\r\nthey remained famous, had grown scarce because the scribes were afraid\r\nto attempt them. Hence, more especially in Germany, it was not merely\r\nthe output of a single generation which came to the press before 1500,\r\nbut the whole of the medieval literature which remained alive, i.e.\r\nretained a reputation sufficient to attract buyers. A study of lists of\r\nincunabula enables a student to see just what works this included, and\r\nthe degree of their popularity. On the other hand in Italy the influence\r\nof the classical renaissance is reflected in the enormous output of\r\nLatin classics, and the progress of Greek studies can be traced in the\r\ndisplacement of Latin translations by editions of the originals. The\r\npart which each country and city played in the struggle between the old\r\nideals and the new can be determined in extraordinary detail by a study\r\nof the output of its presses, although some allowance must be made for\r\nthe extent to which books were transported along the great trade routes.\r\nThus the fact that the Venetian output nearly equalled that of the whole\r\nof the rest of Italy was no doubt mainly due to its export trade.\r\nVenetian books penetrated everywhere, and the skill of Venetian printers\r\nin liturgical books procured them commissions to print whole editions\r\nfor the English market. From the almost complete absence of scholarly\r\nbooks in the lists of English Incunabula it would be too much to\r\nconclude that there was no demand for such books in England. The demand\r\nexisted and was met by importation, which a statute of Richard III.'s\r\nexpressly facilitated. But that it was not commercially possible for a\r\nscholarly press to be worked in England, and that no man of means was\r\nready to finance one, tells its own tale. The total number of incunabula\r\nprinted in England was probably upwards of four hundred, of which Caxton\r\nproduced fully one-fourth. Of the ten thousand different incunabula\r\nwhich the British Museum and Bodleian library possess between them,\r\nabout 4100 are Italian, 3400 German, 1000 French, 700 from the\r\nNetherlands, 400 from Switzerland, 150 from Spain and Portugal, 50 from\r\nother parts of the continent of Europe and 200 English, the proportion\r\nof these last being about doubled by the special zeal with which they\r\nhave been collected. The celebration in 1640 of the second centenary (as\r\nit was considered) of the invention of printing may be taken as the date\r\nfrom which incunabula began to be collected for their own sake, apart\r\nfrom their literary interest, and the publication of Beughem's\r\n_Incunabula typographiae_ in 1688 marks the increased attention paid to\r\nthem. But up to the end of the 17th century Caxtons could still be\r\nbought for a few shillings. The third centenary of the invention of\r\nprinting in 1740 again stimulated enthusiasm, and by the end of the 18th\r\ncentury the really early books were eagerly competed for. Interest in\r\nbooks of the last ten or fifteen years of the century is a much more\r\nmodern development, but with the considerable literature which has grown\r\nup round the subject is not likely to be easily checked.\r\n\r\n  The chief collections of incunabula are those of the Bibliothèque\r\n  Nationale at Paris, Royal library, Munich, and British Museum, London,\r\n  the number of separate editions in each library exceeding nine\r\n  thousand, with numerous duplicates. The number of separate editions at\r\n  the Bodleian library is about five thousand. Other important\r\n  collections are at the University library, Cambridge, and the John\r\n  Rylands library, Manchester, the latter being based on the famous\r\n  Althorp library formed by Earl Spencer (see BOOK-COLLECTING).\r\n       (A.

Heusler, _Ber._, 1891, 24, p. 4161).\r\n\r\n        / CH3\r\n  C6H4 /             = C7H7NH2 + C7H6N2.\r\n       \\  N:N NHC7H7\r\n\r\nIt crystallizes in needles (from hot water), which melt at 146.5° C. and\r\nboil at 269°-270° C. It is readily soluble in hot water, alcohol and\r\ndilute hydrochloric acid. Nitrous acid converts it into nitrosoindazole;\r\nwhilst on heating with the alkyl iodides it is converted into alkyl\r\nindazoles.\r\n\r\nA series of compounds isomeric with these alkyl derivatives is known,\r\nand can be considered as derived from the ring system\r\n\r\n   /\\/ NH \\\r\n  |  |     \\ N.\r\n   \\/\\ CH //\r\n\r\nThese isomers are called _isindazoles_, and may be prepared by the\r\nreduction of the nitroso-ortho-alkylamino-acetophenones with zinc dust\r\nand water or acetic acid. The indazoles are weak bases, which\r\ncrystallize readily. Phenyl indazole, on reduction with sodium and\r\nabsolute alcohol, gives a dihydro derivative (K. L. Paal, _Ber._, 1891,\r\n24, p. 963).\r\n\r\n  For other derivatives, see E. Fischer and J. Tafel, _Ann._ 1885, 227,\r\n  p. 314.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEMNITY (through Fr. _indemnité_, Lat. _indemnis_, free from damage or\r\nloss; _in_-, negative, and _damnum_, loss), in law, an undertaking,\r\neither express or implied, to compensate another for loss or damage, or\r\nfor trouble or expense incurred; also the sum so paid (see CONTRACT; and\r\nINSURANCE: _Marine_). An act of indemnity is a statute passed for the\r\npurpose either of relieving persons from disabilities and penalties to\r\nwhich they have rendered themselves liable or to make legal transactions\r\nwhich, when they took place, were illegal. An act or bill of indemnity\r\nused to be passed every session by the English parliament for the relief\r\nof those who had unwittingly neglected to qualify themselves in certain\r\nrespects for the holding of offices, &c., as, for example, justices,\r\nwithout taking the necessary oaths. The Promissory Oaths Act 1868\r\nrendered this unnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDENE, C9H8, a hydrocarbon found in the fraction of the coal tar\r\ndistillate boiling between 176° and 182° C., and from which it may be\r\nextracted by means of its picrate (G. Kramer, A. Spilker, Ber., 1890,\r\n23, p. 3276). It may also be obtained by distilling the calcium salt of\r\nhydrindene carboxylic acid, C6H4(CH2)2·CH·COOH. It is an oil which boils\r\nat 179.5°-180.5°, and has a specific gravity 1.04 (15° C.). Dilute\r\nnitric acid oxidizes it to phthalic acid, and sodium reduces it in\r\nalcoholic solution to _hydrindene_, C9H10. A. v. Baeyer and W. H. Perkin\r\n(Ber., 1884, 17, p. 125) by the action of sodiomalonic ester on\r\northo-xylylene bromide obtained a hydrindene dicarboxylic ester,\r\n\r\n  C6H4(CH2Br)2 + 2CHNa(CO2C2H5)2 = 2NaBr + CH2(CO2C2H5)2\r\n    + C6H4:[CH2]2:C(CO2C2H5)2;\r\n\r\nthis ester on hydrolysis yields the corresponding acid, which on heating\r\nloses carbon dioxide and gives the monocarboxylic acid of hydrindene.\r\nThe barium salt of this acid, when heated, yields indene and not\r\nhydrindene, hydrogen being liberated (W. H. Perkin, _Jour. Chem. Soc._,\r\n1894, 65, p. 228). Indene vapour when passed through a red hot tube\r\nyields chrysene. It combines with nitrosyl chloride to form indene\r\nnitrosate (M. Dennstedt and C. Ahrens, _Ber._, 1895, 28, p. 1331) and it\r\nreacts with benzaldehyde, oxalic ester and formic ester (J. Thiele,\r\n_Ber._, 1900, 33, p. 3395).\r\n\r\n  On the derivatives of indene see W. v. Miller, _Ber._, 1890, 23, p.\r\n  1883; Th. Zincke, _Ber._, 1887, 20, p. 2394, 1886, 19, p. 2493; and W.\r\n  Roser and E. Haselhoff, _Ann._, 1888, 247, p. 140.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDENTURE (through O. Fr. _endenture_ from a legal Latin term\r\n_indentura_, _indentare_, to cut into teeth, to give a jagged edge, in\r\n_modum dentium_, like teeth), a law term for a special form of deed\r\nexecuted between two or more parties, and having counterparts or copies\r\nequal to the number of parties. These copies were all drawn on one piece\r\nof vellum or paper divided by a toothed or \"indented\" line. The copies\r\nwhen separated along this waved line could then be identified as\r\n\"tallies\" when brought together. Deeds executed by one party only had a\r\nsmooth or \"polled\" edge, whence the name \"deed poll.\" By the Real\r\nProperty Act 1845, § 5, all deeds purporting to be \"indentures\" have the\r\neffect of an \"indenture,\" even though the indented line be absent. The\r\nname \"chirograph\" (Gr. [Greek: cheir], hand, [Greek: graphein], to\r\nwrite) was also early applied to such a form of deed, and the word\r\nitself was often written along the indented line (see further DEED and\r\nDIPLOMATIC). The term \"indenture\" is now used generally of any sealed\r\nagreement between two or more parties, and specifically of a contract of\r\napprenticeship, whence the phrase \"to take up one's indentures,\" on\r\ncompletion of the term, and also of a contract by labourers to serve in\r\na foreign country or colony (see COOLIE).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEPENDENCE, a city and the county-seat of Jackson county, Missouri,\r\nU.S.A., 3 m. S. of the Missouri river and 10 m. E. of Kansas City. Pop.\r\n(1890) 6380, (1900) 6974 (937 negroes); (1910) 9859. The city is served\r\nby the Missouri Pacific, the Chicago & Alton, and the Kansas City\r\nSouthern railways, and by an electric line and fine boulevard to Kansas\r\nCity. It is situated about 1000 ft. above the sea, and is surrounded by\r\na fertile agricultural district. The city has a small public square\r\n(surrounding the court-house) and a public library, and is the seat of\r\nSt Mary's Academy, under the control of the Sisters of Mercy. Among its\r\nmanufactures are farming implements, flour and lumber. The municipality\r\nowns its electric lighting plant. Independence was laid out as a town\r\nand chosen as the county-seat in 1827, first chartered as a city in 1849\r\nand made a city of the third-class in 1889. About 1500 Mormons,\r\nattracted by the \"revelation\" that this was to be a Zion, settled in and\r\nabout Independence in 1831 and 1832. They contemplated building their\r\nchief temple about ½ m. W. of the site of the present court house, but\r\nin 1833 (partly because they invited free negroes to join them) were\r\nexpelled by the \"gentile\" inhabitants of Independence. In 1867 a\r\nsettlement of about 150 Hedrickites, or members of the \"Church of Jesus\r\nChrist\" (organized in Illinois in 1835), came here and secretly bought\r\nup parts of the \"Temple Lot.\" The heirs of the settlers of 1831-1832\r\nconveyed the lot by deed to the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of\r\nLatter Day Saints (with headquarters at Lamoni, Iowa), which brought\r\nsuit against the Hedrickites, but in 1894 the U.S. Circuit Court of\r\nAppeals decided the case on the ground of laches in favour of the\r\nHedrickites, who fifteen years afterwards had nearly died out. In\r\n1867-1869 a few families belonging to the Reorganized Church of Jesus\r\nChrist of Latter Day Saints (monogamists) settled in Independence, and\r\nin 1908 their church here had about 2000 members. Besides a large church\r\nbuilding, they have here a printing establishment, from which is issued\r\nthe weekly _Zion's Ensign_ (founded in 1891), and the \"Independence\r\nSanitarium\" (completed in 1908). The faithful Mormons still look to\r\nIndependence as the Zion of the church. In 1907 a number of Mormons from\r\nUtah settled here, moving the headquarters of the \"Central States'\r\nMission\" from Kansas City to Independence, and founded a periodical\r\ncalled _Liahona, the Elder's Journal_. From about 1831 to 1844, when its\r\nriver landing was destroyed by flood, Independence was the headquarters\r\nand outfitting point of the extensive caravan trains for the Santa Fé,\r\nOregon and Old Salt Lake trails. During the Civil War about 300 Federals\r\nunder Lieut.-Colonel D. H. Buel, occupying the town, were captured on\r\nthe 16th of August 1862 by Colonel Hughes in command of 1500\r\nConfederates, and on the 22nd of October 1864 a part of General Sterling\r\nPrice's Confederate army was defeated a few miles E. of Independence by\r\nGeneral Alfred Pleasonton.",
