The casual reader, with\r\nno particular interest in natural history, seeks in such a book little\r\nmore than stories of animal life thought of mainly as \"big game,\" with\r\nan appetite for the adventurous and wonderful. But beasts and birds\r\nand snakes, although they number in the aggregate thousands of kinds,\r\nare but few compared with the almost innumerable hosts of the lower\r\norders of animal life that dwell in the wildernesses of the world,\r\nor throng in the seas, or hover about us in the air; yet they are a\r\npart of the zoölogy of the globe, and a most important part. Although\r\nthey may rarely have the picturesque interest that attaches to the\r\nvertebrate groups, they exhibit great beauty in many cases, and are\r\nthe foundation on which the others rest, for they furnish the food\r\non which the more highly organized creatures subsist. To the student\r\nthis lower half is often more attractive than the upper half; and the\r\nhistory and philosophy of animal life could not be understood unless it\r\nwas fully considered. The author has therefore devoted a proportionate\r\nspace to the lower orders, at the expense of detailed descriptions of\r\nbirds and beasts, knowing that these are easily accessible elsewhere.\r\nThe arrangement of the matter in the volume is according to the latest\r\nresults of critics of classification, and it illustrates, as well as\r\nany lineal arrangement can, the principle of the development of the\r\nhigher classes from the inferior by a gradual evolution toward more and\r\nmore complex forms. Space did not permit of much exposition of methods\r\nof development, as revealed by fossils; and the volume on Paleontology\r\nshould be read in connection with this one.\r\n\r\n                                                      ERNEST INGERSOLL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n     CHAPTER                                                 PAGE\r\n\r\n          I.

The world in which\r\nhe found himself was a vast mystery which, very crudely at first, he\r\nsought to penetrate. All his paths of thought led him circling back to\r\nhimself as the greatest mystery of all. He struggled with the problem\r\nfor thousands of years, framing fanciful guessworks, erecting elaborate\r\nstructures of logic on foundations of error, emotion, and presumption,\r\nfashioning beautiful fables and theories (and waging wars to compel\r\nother men to accept them), yet found no better solution than that life\r\nmust be a gift from some unknown, perhaps unknowable, source. Even\r\nlately, learned philosophers, such as Helmholtz and Kelvin, supposed it\r\nbrought to the earth (in germs) by meteorites--fragments of exploded\r\nplanets that had borne life before they went to destruction; or, like\r\nArrhenius, postulated an impalpable dust, or \"panspermia,\" scattered\r\nthrough all space and borne from the atmosphere of one planet to\r\nanother. But all such hypotheses only threw the question of origin one\r\nstep further back.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, beginning a few hundred years ago, when greater privilege of\r\ninquiry became possible in a jealous society, naturalists had tried\r\nto attack the problem from a new angle. They asked themselves whether\r\nthey might not, by intensive study of living things, find the quality\r\nof life itself, hoping that if that could be done the source of it\r\nmight be disclosed. In their earnest work they constantly improved\r\ntheir methods and their instruments, and so penetrated deeper and\r\ndeeper into the constitution of plants and animals, until at last they\r\nfound the ultimate particle in the cell and discovered living things so\r\nsimple that they consisted of one cell alone; but why that microscopic\r\nparticle was _alive_, while the grain of crystal beside it, or the drop\r\nof water in which it swam, was _not_ alive, remained unexplained.\r\n\r\nThereupon some of the naturalists fell back into the ranks of the\r\nspeculative and religious persons who were content to believe the\r\nendowment of the world with life an act of a Divine Creator--something\r\nabove and outside of nature as otherwise manifested; others asserted\r\nan equivalent but more materialistic doctrine that they styled\r\n\"spontaneous generation,\" which presently was shown to be untrue, at\r\nleast in the way they formulated it; and a third group confessed that\r\nthey did not know whence life came, nor were they much concerned to\r\nknow.\r\n\r\n\r\n       LIFE CONSTANTLY ORIGINATED BY NATURE'S PRODUCTIVE ENERGY\r\n\r\nThis quest having failed--although it had taught much by the way--the\r\nchemists, who had been making marvelous discoveries in the inorganic\r\nlifeless half of nature, undertook a far more serious exploration of\r\nthe organic living half. You have interpreted very fully, they told\r\nthe naturalists, the forms, and structure, and functions of organisms,\r\nbut can get no further; now let us chemists try whether we cannot find\r\nthe principle of life by analyzing the _substance_ of living things.\r\n\r\nProfiting by their experience, they turned to the colloids in hope of a\r\nclue. A colloid is a substance that shows no power of crystallization,\r\nand is composed of molecules united by their own affinity, and not\r\nby atomic affinity. They have a gelatinlike nature or composition,\r\nalthough varying greatly in chemical composition and general character.\r\nThey differ widely in stability, for instance, some being easily upset\r\nby a change in conditions; and this peculiarity is of great importance\r\nin relation to the phenomena of life, for colloids enter largely into\r\nthe composition of all living bodies, but always in a delicately\r\nbalanced union with crystalloids. \"The colloid is in fact,\" declared\r\nThomas Graham, who first investigated its properties, \"a dynamical\r\nstate of matter; the crystalloid being the statical condition. The\r\ncolloid possesses Energia. It may be looked upon as the probable\r\nprimary source of the force appearing in the phenomena of vitality.\"\r\n\r\nNow, many of the properties of inorganic colloids approximate those\r\nfound in living structures, which appear to be \"alive\" by reason of the\r\nconversion of the energy of the sunlight into the chemical energy of\r\ntheir constituent (organic) colloids. The agent in this conversion is\r\nthe green substance chlorophyll in the cell or cells of the plant; and,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, all the energy in living things arises from\r\nthis one source, transmuted by this one transformer. Yet chlorophyll\r\nis far too complex a substance to arise as a first step from inorganic\r\nmatter, even where conditions are suitable for life to appear; and the\r\nspontaneous production of such a thing as a bacterium would not solve\r\nthe problem, for the new-born cell would have no organic food, and\r\nmust at once perish. In an utterly lifeless planet inorganic colloids\r\nmust first develop, and in time one of these must begin to evolve not\r\na living cell, or anything so complex as a bacillus, but something in\r\nthe way of a molecule holding a higher store of chemical energy than\r\nanything before it. Later such colloids, perhaps uniting with others,\r\nwould begin to condense and form more complex organic molecules, and\r\nfinally effect unions with crystalloids. Thus would organic complexity\r\ngradually be led up to, chlorophyll brought into being, and life\r\nappear. One of the foremost of the biochemists, Prof. Benjamin Moore,\r\nof the University of Liverpool, has summed this up picturesquely:\r\n\r\n\"It was no fortuitous combination of chances, and no cosmic dust, which\r\nbrought life to the womb of our ancient Mother Earth in the far-distant\r\nPaleozoic ages, but a well-regulated orderly development, which comes\r\nto every mother earth in the universe in the maturity of her creation\r\nwhen the conditions arrive within the suitable limits. Given the\r\npresence of matter and energy forms under the proper conditions, life\r\nmust come inevitably.... If this view be the true one, there must\r\nexist a whole world of living creatures which the microscope has never\r\nshown us, leading up to bacteria and the protozoa. The brink of life\r\nlies ... away down among the colloids, and the beginning of life was\r\nnot a fortuitous event occurring millions of years ago and never again\r\nrepeated, but one which in its primordial stages keeps on repeating\r\nitself all the time and in our generation. So that, if all intelligent\r\ncreatures were by some holocaust destroyed, up out of the depths in\r\nprocess of millions of years intelligent beings would once more emerge.\"\r\n\r\nThat is to say, life arose through a recombination of forces\r\npreexisting in the cosmos, and the fact was but a step in the\r\nevolutionary process. \"Such evolution,\" the American biologist, Henry\r\nFairfield Osborn, declares with emphasis, \"is essentially constructive,\r\nand ... is continually giving birth to an infinite variety of new forms\r\nand functions which never appeared in the universe before. It is a\r\ncontinuous creation or creative evolution. Although this creative power\r\nis something new derived from the old, it presents the first of the\r\nnumerous contrasts between the living and the lifeless world.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                           LIFE'S BORDERLAND\r\n\r\nAlthough in some respects a deceptive resemblance may appear between\r\nthe living and the nonliving, the distinction is definite. Living\r\nbodies, plant or animal, are made up of protoplasm, which, although\r\nmineral in substance, consists of a combination never found in the\r\nmineral kingdom. It gives to the body containing it the power of\r\ngrowth, and this growth is by additions from within. Minerals may\r\nincrease in size, but only by additions from without. The prime\r\ncharacteristics of living organisms is that they reproduce their kind,\r\ngiven favorable conditions. Minerals never do so. A correlative of\r\nlife and growth is death, but minerals never die. In the course of its\r\ncareer every animal or plant, in proportion to its need or the degree\r\nof complexity of its organs, develops within itself characteristic\r\ncompounds, such as albumin, gluten, starch, cellulose, fat and other\r\nchemical results, not a trace of any of which is to be found in rocks\r\nor soil, or in the water or in the air. No distinction in nature is\r\nso absolute as that between the inorganic and the organic realms, the\r\nnonliving and living things, so far as our senses can perceive them.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, we consider the two prime divisions of the living\r\nworld--animal and vegetable--so diverse in their higher developments,\r\nwe find them springing from the same base in a single cell of almost\r\nstructureless protoplasm, and so alike in this simplest form as to\r\nbe in some cases indistinguishable--mere drops of living matter\r\nwhose functions are so limited that they present no discriminative\r\ncharacteristics. Indeed, marking a definite boundary between animals\r\nand plants may be difficult in cases much higher in the scale than\r\nthese primitive globules of protoplasm.\r\n\r\nA fundamental distinction between plants and animals as we now know\r\nthem is the exclusive possession by plants of the green substance\r\nchlorophyll, by the presence of which their food is transformed under\r\nthe influence of sunlight into vital energy in a manner essentially\r\ndifferent from that by which animals assimilate their substance.\r\nChlorophyll is a complex, nitrogenous, colloidal substance, produced\r\nby and always associated with, protoplasm, and related to the coloring\r\nmatter of the blood of animals. It is restricted to plants, and usually\r\nresides only in definite portions of the cell; yet we have good reason\r\nfor believing, as Prof. William F. Ganong tells us, that our present\r\ngreen plants were preceded in time by a colorless kind of the utmost\r\nsimplicity, and without chlorophyll, which yet could make their own\r\nfood from carbon dioxide and water by using the energy of chemical\r\noxidation of soil-minerals in place of sunlight. \"We have precisely\r\nsuch chemosynthetic organisms, a kind of soil bacteria, still living on\r\nthe earth at this day; and they are doubtless the lineal descendants\r\nof the ancient forms, which probably lived in the mud of shallow seas\r\nthat may be full of them yet.\" These ancient chemosynthetic organisms\r\nwere neither animal nor plant, but both and between. They must have\r\nexpanded, varied, evolved, thus originating a great many branches, most\r\nof which perished.\r\n\r\nNow, from this biochemical borderland of life, let us turn our\r\nattention to the living world as we know it to-day, or as preserved\r\nfor us in the \"record of the rocks,\" pausing only to fix well in our\r\nminds the main distinctions between animals and plants. Plants have no\r\nspecial organs for digestion or circulation, nor any nervous system.\r\nMost plants absorb inorganic food, such as water, carbonic acid gas,\r\nnitrate of ammonia, phosphates, silica, etc. No animal swallows any\r\nof these minerals as food. On the other hand, plants manufacture from\r\nsuch materials the food on which animals exist, by the production and\r\nstorage in their tissues of starch, sugar, and nitrogenous substances.\r\nThe two kingdoms supplement one another. They are mutually dependent,\r\nand probably originated simultaneously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n                        THE SEA A VAST AQUARIUM\r\n\r\n\r\nNo results of investigation in natural history have been more amazing\r\nthan those that show the marvelous richness of the sea in plant and\r\nanimal life--not merely at its warm margin, but far out in the centre\r\nof what the ancients used to call \"the desert of waters\"; not only at\r\nits surface, but in its profoundest depths, and under the polar ice as\r\nwell as amid the tropics. Sea populations differ somewhat according\r\nto situation, those of the shallow shore lines, which are of the\r\n\"littoral\" fauna, differ largely from those living in the open sea\r\nand belonging to the \"pelagic\" fauna, and there are surface swimmers,\r\nand others confined to the abysses; but virtually every class and\r\nsubdivision in the animal kingdom is represented in greater or less\r\nvariety in the zoölogy of the ocean. The list stretches from the merest\r\nmonads to the huge sharks and still bigger whales.\r\n\r\nThis multitude and diversity of animal life is possible in the sea\r\nbecause of an even greater plenitude of plants there, which furnish\r\na never-failing food resource. Bacteria and blue-green algæ are at\r\nthe base of this. Bacteria exist in all seas, as in all soils, and\r\nthe fertility of nature above ground and under water depends on these\r\nmicroscopic organisms, whose numbers in the ocean are as incalculable\r\nas the grains of sand on its brink. In equal multitude are the\r\ndiatoms, unicellular algæ with flinty cases, by which the waves are\r\nsometimes discolored over broad areas; and millions of other green\r\nplants, living alone, or in chains, minute in size, but each a chemical\r\nlaboratory converting the salt water they absorb into meals for the\r\nanimals that swallow them--animals in most cases almost as small and\r\nsimple as the things they eat, and themselves destined to be sucked\r\ninto the mouth of something a little bigger, to be in turn a tidbit for\r\na third hungry mouth, and so on to the broiled mackerel for our own\r\nbreakfast.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 THE PLANKTON AND ITS PHOSPHORESCENCE\r\n\r\nThe assemblage of plants and animals that together float or swim at or\r\nnear the surface of the ocean (or other water), say within a layer of\r\nwater one hundred fathoms thick, is scientifically called _plankton_\r\nof the sea. In the open ocean, the pelagic plankton is much alike all\r\nround the world of waters, although it varies a little in composition,\r\nand still more in relative abundance, being denser in temperate than\r\nin either tropical or polar latitudes; but nowhere is it absent. The\r\n\"waste of waters\" teems with life. The plankton of the shallow waters\r\nnear continental shores, however, presents a decidedly different\r\nassemblage from the pelagic plankton.\r\n\r\nIn the pelagic plankton, single-celled animals of the groups called\r\nforaminifers and radiolarians are exceedingly prominent, and play an\r\nenormous part in the economy of the sea, although almost or quite\r\nmicroscopic in size. They are incased in chambered shells of lime or\r\nflint; and over vast areas in warm latitudes the ocean floor is so\r\nthickly covered with the dead shells of one kind that the mud is\r\ncalled globigerina ooze. They are the eaters of the microscopic plants,\r\nand themselves are food for a wide variety of hydroids and jellyfish,\r\nlarge and small, whose silvery forms are often visible to the voyager,\r\nand which are mostly responsible for the pale stars of phosphorescence\r\nthat shine about his prow and glorify his wake in dark nights. The\r\nqueen of these far swimmers is the radiant Portuguese man-of-war. In\r\nthe night a dragging fine-meshed net will capture more than by day of\r\nthe plankton, because many little creatures that in daylight sink to\r\nconsiderable depths come to the surface at night.\r\n\r\nRising a step to the worms, we find them comparatively rare, but one\r\nkind of marine flatworm that abounds in midocean is rose-red and\r\nseveral inches long. Much more numerous is another flatworm, Sagitta,\r\n\"which along with copepoda, salpæ, pteropoda and radiolaria, everywhere\r\nconstitute the bulk of the small pelagic organisms\" captured by towing\r\nnets. Like almost all of these usually defenseless creatures they\r\nare perfectly transparent, but some of them depart from the rule of\r\npale blue in tint and shine in bright red. A longer step takes us to\r\nthe Crustacea, represented in the pelagic plankton by queer little\r\nshrimplike forms that in countless hosts of individuals play a part in\r\nthe ocean comparable to that of insects on land. The copepods are the\r\nmost numerous probably--little things only a fraction of an inch in\r\nlength, but amazingly abundant, and the principal users of plant food.\r\nTheir relatives, the little ostracods, have similar habits, and are\r\nnoted for their intense phosphorescence. Haeckel relates that on his\r\nway to Ceylon he saw the entire sea like a twinkling ocean of light,\r\nand his microscope showed him that it was made by throngs of ostracods,\r\nwith some jellyfishes, salpæ and worms. Crustaceans of higher rank\r\nabound also. In northern waters species of Schizopoda, small,\r\ntransparent prawns with red spots around the mouth and big, black eyes,\r\nswarm in enormous numbers, and are known to the fishermen as \"kril.\"\r\n\r\nAn important part of the pelagic plankton consists of certain small\r\nmollusks; and \"as regards abundance of individuals few groups of\r\npelagic animals can compare with the winged snails, or Pteropoda.\"\r\nThese are minute, rapidly swimming creatures with thin, glassy shells,\r\nand in some parts of the warmer oceans these discarded shells are so\r\nnumerous on the bottom that they give the name pteropod ooze to the\r\nmud. One kind (Limacina), with a coiled shell about the size of a\r\npinhead, which abounds in the north Atlantic, is much feared by the\r\nNorwegian fishermen because they very often spoil the herring that\r\nfeed on them. Another kind (Clione), looking somewhat like a reddish\r\nbutterfly an inch or so long, swims in shoals in the icy seas of the\r\nfar North, and is known as \"whales' food.\" Some larger mollusks, of\r\nwhich the beautiful purple Ianthina is most conspicuous, live among the\r\nvast patches of floating seaweed in the Sargasso Sea.\r\n\r\nGreat numbers and variety of tunicates or ascidians and their larvæ\r\nare taken in the surface nets of the sea naturalists, among them the\r\nsalpæ--free-swimming, barrel-shaped, transparent animals well known\r\nto all seafaring people, and often seen crowding the surface of the\r\nocean. One genus of them is Pyrosoma, which has from the earliest\r\ndays excited the interest of mankind, mainly on account of the strong\r\nphosphorescent light emitted, the name, indeed, meaning \"fire animal.\"\r\nThese salpæ aggregate into colonies often several yards in length which\r\nglow like fiery serpents as they move sinuously on their way.\r\n\r\nThis property of luminosity, so widely possessed by marine animals, is\r\none of the unsolved mysteries. It is called \"phosphorescence,\" because\r\nit resembles the cold light given by phosphorus when undergoing slow\r\noxidation, but phosphorus has nothing to do with the manifestation\r\nhere, or in such insects as the firefly; nor is it owing to bacteria,\r\nas in the case of shining wood or decaying fish. What it really is no\r\none knows, but it has, at least, been learned that in animals the power\r\nof emitting light is always attributable to certain structures of a\r\nglandular nature that secrete a slimy, luminous substance, or, rather,\r\ntwo substances, one luciferin and the other luciferase. When both\r\ntogether are exposed to seawater phosphorescent light results.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the light organ is surrounded by a layer of black pigment\r\nthat acts as a reflector, and often the light is projected through a\r\ntransparent lens; and there is reason to believe that in the case of\r\nthe higher animals, such as deep-sea fishes and squids, the rays may\r\nbe thrown when and where the creature desires, as a man handles an\r\nelectric flashlight. But for what purpose? Is it to illuminate the\r\nsurrounding water so as to perceive, or to attract prey, or is it to\r\navoid foes? A learned oceanographer replies that no one certainly\r\nknows. \"At all events,\" he concludes, \"the answers would probably tend\r\nto show that the many different kinds of light organs serve different\r\npurposes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                 PRISONERS IN THE DARK AND ICY DEPTHS\r\n\r\nSo much for the surface population of the ocean--the plankton layer is\r\nregarded as a hundred fathoms thick. We have considered only that over\r\nthe mid-oceanic depths, but that of the shallow margins is different\r\nsimply in the absence of some purely pelagic creatures, and in the\r\npresence of vast hordes of eggs and larvæ of the animals rooted in the\r\nsand or attached to the rocks and weeds from high-water mark down to a\r\ncomparatively short distance below low-water mark. These I shall speak\r\nof more completely hereafter.\r\n\r\nBefore that, however, I want to say a few words in regard to the\r\nextraordinary inhabitants of the ocean's depths--depths which in some\r\nplaces exceed the elevation of the highest mountains on the land.\r\n\r\nThe conditions under which animal life exists there are vastly\r\ndifferent from those at the surface, and it is not surprising to find\r\nthese creatures of an extraordinary character. The pressure exerted\r\nby water on anything lowered into it increases at a rapid rate as the\r\nobject sinks, so that at a depth of only 500 fathoms it equals about\r\n100 times the pressure at the surface. This contributes to the density\r\nof underlying waters; the saltiness of the sea also adds to the water's\r\ndensity, but this decreases slightly from the surface downward. More\r\nimportant than density in its effect on living things is temperature.\r\nIn the Sargasso Sea in summer the water at the surface will indicate\r\nabout 52 degrees F., and at 100 fathoms of depth 48 degrees, below\r\nwhich it diminishes slowly to a little below the freezing point--32\r\ndegrees F. The water below a few hundred fathoms may therefore be\r\nregarded as a series of layers measured by degrees of density,\r\ntemperature, etc., and this means a series of biological strata in\r\neach of which the denizens are more or less limited by unfavorable\r\nconditions above and below them.\r\n\r\nA fourth factor conditioning deep-sea life is that of light. The\r\nsunlight penetrates to a much greater distance than was formerly\r\nbelieved; and experiments with photographic plates show that the blue\r\nrays may sink as far as 800 fathoms, but the red rays go much less\r\ndown. Below that glimmer is absolute darkness, illuminated only by the\r\nphosphorescent glow of the lanterns carried by the animals moving about\r\nin that Stygian and icy abode--which would seem to us the most dreadful\r\nfate to which any creature on the globe is born.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the ocean depths seem to be divided into\r\nhorizontal zones, certain groups of animals being confined, when\r\nadults, within limits of depth determined by conditions suitable\r\nto them, one zone above the other. Practically, however, these\r\nintermediate life-zones can hardly be defined, and vary in different\r\nseas, and under changing conditions, as of season, and so forth.\r\nAnimals taken only by deep hauls of the nets within the tropics,\r\nfor instance, may be captured in cooler latitudes near the surface;\r\nfurthermore, the vertical distribution of fishes, as a class, may\r\ndiffer from that of crustaceans as a class. Nevertheless it is true\r\nin general that many sorts of pelagic animals dwell at intermediate\r\ndepths, from which, when they have become mature, they cannot either\r\nrise or descend any great distance. Among them are representatives of\r\nall the classes of marine life.\r\n\r\nLet us now consider the creatures of the lowest level--those abysmal\r\ndepths where eternal cold, stillness, darkness, and equability unite\r\nto make an environment so forbidding that human imagination would\r\nrefuse to people it with living beings; yet where life and strife do\r\nactually exist, although by no means uniformly distributed. We know\r\nmost about it as it exists in the bed of the north Atlantic.\r\n\r\nThe real bottom animals are mainly fixed--sponges, hydroids,\r\nsea anemones, bryozoans, brittle-stars, crinoids, brachiopods,\r\nholothurians, worms and mollusks. They are nowhere numerous remote\r\nfrom a shore, and below 2,500 fathoms are very scarce, to judge by\r\nthe results of dredging. Their food comes wholly from the surface,\r\napparently, some catching it as it falls and others sucking it out of\r\nthe ooze. Moving about among these, and feeding on them, is a scanty\r\npopulation of snails, squids, crabs, and fishes, making their living\r\nupon or close to the bottom; and a larger and more varied company of\r\nrelatives swim in the water above them up to, say, the 2,000-fathoms\r\nline. All these are of forms different in many respects from kindred\r\nspecies at or near the surface; and some brought up by the deep-sea\r\ndredge can hardly be distinguished from fossils entombed in the oldest\r\nfossiliferous rocks--so unchangeable is the environment in which their\r\nrace has been propagated for perhaps fifty millions of years.\r\n\r\nThrough these dark abysses swim fishes with extraordinary and grotesque\r\nadaptations to their conditions. All are small, rarely six inches long,\r\noften less than an inch, yet armed to the teeth. This is especially\r\ntrue of the families Stomiatidæ and Sternoptychidæ, in which one finds\r\nfishes of the queerest shape, with big heads and a savage array of long\r\nsharp teeth. All are voracious, for food is scant and must be fought\r\nfor; and some, as Chiasmodus, have mouths so capacious that they often\r\nswallow fishes larger than themselves, when their stretched stomachs\r\nhang beneath their slender bodies like the yolk sacs of newly born\r\ntrout. All are dark in color, brown, blue or violet marking the abyssal\r\nspecies. Some of them have light-giving organs; and this was formerly\r\nregarded as a peculiar possession of deep-sea fishes, enabling them to\r\nsee their prey in the gloom of their habitat, but it is now known that\r\nlight-giving organs are especially characteristic of pelagic fishes of\r\nthe region between the surface and 250 fathoms of depth. It must be\r\nremembered, however, that the sedentary invertebrates of the bottom\r\nglow with phosphorescence.\r\n\r\nThis outline of a vast body of information shows that the waters of the\r\noceans are everywhere inhabited, to their uttermost deeps, by living\r\nbeings; that these are adapted to various circumstances, and so form\r\nfaunas of local extent and character; and that probably the sea derived\r\nits wealth of population--at least all that part superior to the\r\nmonads--from the land, beginning with the earliest dawn of life on the\r\nglobe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                       A CHAPTER OF FOUNDATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n                  THE NATURAL BASIS OF CLASSIFICATION\r\n\r\nI mentioned in my introductory chapter that the simplest form of animal\r\nwas one whose whole being was contained within a single envelope, or\r\n\"skin,\" called a cell. Such a cell contains nothing but that strange\r\nprimitive life-substance named protoplasm, condensed at one point into\r\na nucleus, and it is precisely of such cells that the bodies of all the\r\nanimals we commonly know are made up; nevertheless an immense variety\r\nof creatures still exists, especially in the plankton of the sea, that,\r\nlike those at the dawn of life, consist of one cell alone. Here then we\r\nstand at the first grand division of the animal kingdom:\r\n\r\n    A. Animals consisting of a single cell--_Protozoa_.\r\n\r\n    B. Animals composed of an aggregation of cells--_Metazoa_.\r\n\r\nThis distinction, you see, is one of structure, as must be all the\r\nsubdivisions that follow, if they are to be natural; and it is the\r\nclearest possible illustration of what we mean in zoölogy when we\r\nspeak of \"lower\" and \"higher\" rank, for it is evident that it is a\r\nstep upward, an advance from utter simplicity to greater and greater\r\ncomplexity, to proceed from a single-celled, all but helpless\r\nanimalcule to one composed of many cells, with so vast a division of\r\nlabor and extensive power of action as belong to such a combination of\r\nforces.\r\n\r\nI do not propose to describe the Protozoa, because both of lack of\r\nspace and lack of popular interest; anyone may learn about them in any\r\ngood zoölogical textbook. But I do want to mention one very important\r\npoint, on account of its bearing on the history of the higher animals.\r\nThe protozoans reproduce their kind by simply splitting into two\r\nindividuals, and these again split into another two, and so on; the\r\nprocess is called \"fission.\" There comes a time, however, when the\r\nability to do this ceases, and the protozoans of this strain will die\r\nout unless one or more of them meets with the same kind of animalcule,\r\nand the two \"conjugate,\" or merge into one another, thus renewing their\r\npower to go on dividing.\r\n\r\nTurning now to the Metazoa, or animals in general, we may say that\r\nthey are flexible and usually motile beings, needing a supply of solid\r\nfood which they convert by digestion into a fluid form, and then\r\ndiffuse through their tissues. This accounts for the fact that all\r\nanimals consist essentially of a tube, which in the simpler forms is\r\nvery apparent. This typical tube consists of at least two layers--an\r\nouter, protective, and sensitive coat (ectoderm), and an inner,\r\ndigestive one (endoderm). This two-layered condition is the limit for\r\na few fresh-water and a vast number of marine animals therefore called\r\n\"coelenterata,\" of which the jellyfish and corals are examples. The two\r\ncoats are separated, and at the same time connected, by a greater or\r\nless amount of a jellylike filling called the \"mesenchyme.\" Into this\r\nintermediate mesenchyme both ectoderm and endoderm bud off cells which\r\nhave certain functions--that is, they circulate the digested food,\r\nperform the creeping movements when such occur, expel the waste of the\r\nbody, and most important of all, provide the germ cells by which the\r\nrace is perpetuated.\r\n\r\nNow in animals superior to the jellyfishes and the flatworms, the\r\nmesenchyme is replaced by a definite hollow tissue that produces a more\r\nefficient system of muscular, excretory, and reproductive organs. This\r\nhollow tissue is the \"coelom,\" and in the most advanced animals, such\r\nas the chordates, \"the coelom and its products are of the greatest\r\nimportance, for they give rise to the vertebræ and the muscles, and\r\nin so doing mold the shape of the fish, amphibian, reptile, bird, and\r\nmammal.\"\r\n\r\nIn this brief sketch of some broad distinctions among the masses of\r\nanimals we have a hint of the basis of their classification.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  ANIMAL LIFE IN ORDERLY ARRANGEMENT\r\n\r\nClassification is really only a sorting out of things into groups of\r\nthe same kind. It may be artificial, according to fancy or convenience,\r\nor it may be by discovery of nature's inevitable development. It has\r\nbeen done crudely ever since men began to show curiosity about the\r\nthings around them. They spoke of animals of the land, of the water,\r\nand of the air; of those that lived on vegetable fare as different\r\nfrom the flesh eaters; and in a more particular way they recognized\r\nvarious obviously like and unlike groups within the larger ones. All\r\nthese distinctions were made on external appearance or behavior, and\r\ncloser observation presently showed bad combinations, such as placing\r\nbats with birds simply because both flew, or whales with fish because\r\nboth lived in water. Slowly it became evident that the only proper way\r\nto classify animals was by putting together those of like structure,\r\nand this could be accomplished only by intense comparative study of\r\nthe interior anatomy of their bodies. Even here, however, progress\r\nwas limited until the great light from the idea of organic evolution\r\nfell on biological science, by which it was perceived that the true\r\ncriterion by which the proper place of any animal could be determined\r\nwas its line of descent--a matter wherein the student of fossils\r\ncould render, and has rendered, vast assistance. In other words a\r\nreal, natural classification is according to ancestry, just as human\r\nrelatives are grouped into families according to their known descent\r\nfrom the same forefather.\r\n\r\nIn this evolutionary light zoölogists have now perfected, at least in\r\nrespect to its larger divisions, a classification of the animal kingdom\r\nwhich is generally accepted, and is followed in this book. It proceeds,\r\nreading downward, from the simpler and older forms of animal life to\r\nthe more complex and more recent forms.\r\n\r\nAs to the names and relative order, or rank, of the subdivisions that\r\nwe shall have occasion to mention, a few words are desirable. The only\r\nreal fact is the individual animal. A collection of these so similar\r\nthat they cannot be divided, and which will interbreed, but usually are\r\nsterile as to other animals, is termed a _species_. A number of species\r\nclosely similar are bracketed together as a _genus_ (plural _genera_),\r\nand this done, every individual is given a double name, as _Felis\r\nleo_ to the lion, the first part of which indicates its genus, and is\r\ncalled its \"generic\" name, and the second indicates its species, and\r\nis called its \"specific\" name. This \"scientific name\" is given in Latin\r\n(or Latinized Greek) so that it may be unmistakably understood in all\r\nparts of the world, for a local name in one language would mean nothing\r\nto a student speaking some other language, or perhaps speaking the same\r\nlanguage in another country; thus the name \"robin\" is applied to half\r\na dozen very different birds in separate parts of the English-speaking\r\nworld, and endless confusion would result were not each animal labeled\r\nin a language understood by everybody; and this must be a dead\r\nlanguage, so that the significance of the terms applied shall not vary\r\nin place or time.\r\n\r\nSeveral similar genera may form a _family_; families that agree in\r\nessential characteristics are united as _orders_; orders are grouped\r\ninto _classes_; and finally like classes are assembled into a _phylum_\r\n(Greek, \"a leaf\": plural _phyla_), which is the largest division except\r\nthe primary distinction of Protozoa and Metazoa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n                   THE HUMBLEST OF ANIMALS--SPONGES\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the arrangement of phyla in the metazoa stand the\r\nPorifera, or sponges, fixed, plantlike, queerly shaped beings living\r\nin the sea, except one family in fresh waters, and abundant in all\r\nthe warmer parts of the world on rocky bottoms. Whatever its size or\r\nshape, a live sponge (of which the commercial article is the more or\r\nless perfect skeleton) is coated with a thin fleshy membrane perforated\r\nby minute \"inhalant pores\" and larger holes termed \"oscula,\" or\r\nmouths. Through the inhalant pores the sea water, with its burden of\r\nmicroscopic food, enters one of many spaces beneath the surface from\r\nwhich incurrent canals penetrate the interior of the sponge, constantly\r\nbranching and growing smaller until lost to sight. The fine tips\r\ncommunicate with small cavities lined with cells that are fitted to\r\nseize and assimilate the nourishment brought them by the water. From\r\nthese rudimentary stomachs go similar excurrent ducts that unite near\r\nthe surface into trunk canals that carry out the used water and waste\r\nproducts. This system of circulation, bringing nutrient water strained\r\nthrough the pores, and expelling it forcibly after it has been cleared\r\nof food value, is kept in motion, with occasional periods of rest,\r\nby the action of \"flagellate cells\" that line certain tracts in the\r\ncanals. These are elongated cells from which project whiplashlike\r\nfilaments, one to each cell, whose movements in concert \"resemble\r\nthose which a very supple fishing rod is made to undergo in the act\r\nof casting a long line\"--the movement being much swifter from without\r\ninward.\r\n\r\nBeneath the outer skin, and all among the canals and cavities, is a\r\nfilling of gelatinous materials, largely protoplasm, in which are\r\nformed great numbers of variously branched and strengthening spicules,\r\nof limy material in one group, and in others of a flinty or glassy\r\nnature, or in the absence of these, a network of \"spongin,\" such\r\nas forms the skeleton of our common washing sponges. Spongin is a\r\nsubstance allied to silk in chemical composition, and the threads are\r\nfelted together in such a way as to form a firm, yet elastic structure.\r\n\"In some Noncalcarea, which are devoid of spicules, the place of these\r\nis taken by foreign bodies--shells of Radiolaria, grains of sand, or\r\nspicules from other sponges. In others again, such as the Venus's\r\nflower basket (Euplectella), the glass-rope sponge (Hyalonema), and\r\nothers, the skeleton consists throughout of siliceous spicules bound\r\ntogether by a siliceous cement.\"\r\n\r\nSponges are reproduced both by budding in some form, which is an\r\nasexual way, and by the sexual method of eggs and male cells; these are\r\nformed in the same sponge, but rarely at the same time, and the early\r\nstages of development are passed in a brood-cell within the body of the\r\nparent sponge. Finally, the embryo escapes through one of the outgoing\r\ncanals, swims about awhile, becomes thimble-shaped, and settling down,\r\nfastens itself by the closed end to some patch of mud, a rock, dead\r\nshell or seaweed, closes the open end of the \"thimble,\" and proceeds\r\nto grow.\r\n\r\nSponges do not appear to be eaten by fishes or anything else. Countless\r\nlower animals, such as marine worms, mollusks, and so forth, burrow\r\ninto them, however, in search of shelter; and in reversal, certain\r\nsmall sponges, such as the cliona of our shores, burrow into the shells\r\nof mollusks, which explains the honeycombed appearance of many of the\r\nshells picked up on the beach. Sponges have a large part in that very\r\ninteresting and widespread phase of marine life called \"commensalism,\"\r\nin which two animals become intimately associated in a mutually\r\nbeneficial way, and are thus spoken of as messmates. Some kinds of\r\nsponge are never found growing except on the backs or legs of certain\r\ncrabs; the sponge conceals and protects the crab, while itself benefits\r\nby being carried from place to place, with constantly new changes of\r\nfresh water and food. This sort of partnership occurs in many different\r\ngroups of marine animals.\r\n\r\nThe capture and preparation of sponges for market employ thousands\r\nof men and boats in the eastern Mediterranean, whence the best are\r\nderived, and in the West Indies and Gulf of Mexico, where the sponges\r\nare of a coarser kind, and are gathered and prepared by rougher\r\nmethods. They are taken commercially also in other seas, and frequently\r\ndredged from vast depths.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n                          FLOWERS OF THE SEA\r\n\r\n\r\n              JELLYFISHES, NAMESAKES OF THE FABLED MEDUSA\r\n\r\nThe type and simplest form of that great division of aquatic,\r\nand almost exclusively marine, animals constituting the phylum\r\nCoelenterata, is the polyp. It consists of a soft-skinned body,\r\ntypically cup-shaped, containing a baglike digestive cavity, or\r\nprimitive stomach, open at the top, and surrounded by the soft\r\nmesenchyme. The open upper end is the mouth, which is usually encircled\r\nby few or many tentacles--hollow outgrowths from the wall of the\r\ntubular gullet. Currents of water are drawn in by waving cilia at one\r\nend of the slitlike mouth, and pass out as waste at the other side;\r\nthey bring food and oxygen from which nourishment is absorbed by the\r\ncells of the wall of the stomach (endoderm). Certain outgrowths within\r\nthe mesenchyme act as feeble muscles for lengthening and shortening the\r\nbody and tentacles; but there are no blood vessels or excretory organs.\r\n\r\nMost polyps are fixed on some support, but in many the young pass\r\nthrough a free, swimming stage before settling down for life. All\r\ncoelenterates, and these only, are provided with \"stinging cells,\" the\r\nnature and importance of which will be explained presently.\r\n\r\nThe simplest class is that of the hydroids (Hydroida), the type of\r\nwhich is the fresh-water hydra, so-called because, like the Hydra\r\nof ancient myth, when it is cut to pieces each part will grow into a\r\nnew animal. It lives in ponds and pools of stagnant water, and is so\r\nsmall that a magnifying glass is necessary to study it, especially\r\nin the case of the green one of our two common American species--the\r\nother is brown. Indeed, similar hydroids of salt water are often taken\r\nand dried by unscientific collectors under the impression that they\r\nare feathery seaweeds. It is stalklike in shape, has long tentacles\r\nwhich always turn toward the greatest light, influenced like certain\r\nplants by heliotropism, and feeds on minute crustaceans and other\r\nminute organisms. Sometimes hydras are so abundant as to form a velvety\r\nsurface in warm pools. The sexes are combined in the same individual,\r\nand the embryo forms within the body, then protrudes as a bud, which\r\nfinally breaks away and after a time sinks, attaches itself at the base\r\nto some support, and grows into a perfect hydra. When quiescent or\r\nalarmed the tentacles are withdrawn, and the whole animal shrinks into\r\na little lump.\r\n\r\nSuch is the general natural history of the group; but the oceanic\r\nhydroids have developed a vast variety of forms, and, with increased\r\nbreadth of life, have added many interesting features and habits.\r\nMany of them are single, rooted in mud, or upon seaweeds, rocks or\r\nshellfish both dead and alive, and look like flowers of lovely tints;\r\nand they reproduce by putting forth separate reproductive parts, called\r\n\"zooids,\" of various kinds. Others are in colonies that spread by\r\nextensions of the base from which arise other hydroids until a bunch\r\nof them are growing side by side; but these groups consist of hydroids\r\ndifferentiated into separate functions, for some devote themselves\r\nto capturing food which nourishes all, through the common base, while\r\nothers produce the buds and eggs by which the colony is increased.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JELLYFISHES\r\n  (_Medusa aurita._ _Rhizostoma cuvieri._ _Cyanea capillata._)]\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable of these processes of reproduction is that which\r\nis represented by the jellyfishes so abundant in all seas, and so\r\nbeautiful either when seen floating along just at the surface of the\r\nsummer sea, or when at night they glow with phosphorescence like\r\nsilvery, greenish rockets in the dark waves. Sometimes they occur in\r\nenormous \"schools\"--as we say of fish--all of one kind, filling the\r\nwater thickly as far as one can see, and now and then in late summer\r\nare cast on the beach in long windrows. They range in size from a\r\npinhead to ten or twelve feet in diameter. So big a Cyanea would\r\nprobably weigh fifty pounds, but after a thorough drying would yield\r\nonly a few ounces of semisolid matter, 99 per cent of the creature\r\nbeing water absorbed in its spongy tissues. Some are egg-shaped, others\r\nlike a bell with a long clapper, but the ordinary form is that of an\r\nopen umbrella, usually fringed about the edge with tentacles, sometimes\r\nshort and fine, sometimes few and long, again a crowded circle of\r\nlong snaky appendages. These elastic hanging tentacles are the means\r\nby which the medusa (as such a jellyfish is appropriately termed in\r\nscience) captures its food, which consists not only of the minute\r\nthings swarming in the plankton, but of other coelenterates, small\r\ncrustacea, fishes, anything in fact that it can entangle in its sticky\r\nnet and sting to death. Every one of the filmy tentacles is thickly\r\nstudded with microscopic cells (cnidocells) covered by a mere film,\r\nand having a spinelike trigger projecting from it. If this trigger is\r\ntouched, or the film broken, out springs the coiled thread dart which\r\nis barbed and carries into the wound it makes a poison that benumbs.\r\nThousands of these microscopic darts may prick the skin of a captive,\r\nand paralyze its strength--as it does that of a man who gets caught\r\nnaked in the trailing net of one of the great northern medusæ. Being\r\nthus captured, the prey is drawn up to the mouth, which opens in the\r\ncenter of the under side of the umbrella float.\r\n\r\nAt intervals around the margin of the umbrella are small organs by\r\nwhich, it is believed, the creature maintains a sense of balance and\r\ndirection, and perhaps of temperature or light, or both; for many\r\nmedusæ sink out of sight by day and come to the surface at night; and\r\nwhen the sea is rough they descend to quiet depths. Thus they have\r\nthe power not only to move ahead by the alternate contraction and\r\ndilatation of the disk, but to so alter their specific gravity as to\r\nsink or rise at will. They thus show the rudiments of both a muscular\r\nand a nervous system.\r\n\r\nVery interesting, and often of great beauty, are the free-swimming,\r\ncolonial, hydroid polyps called siphonophores. On a long stem or\r\nstring are arranged, at the top, a bulb filled with gas or air, as\r\na float, then a series of swimming bells whose pulsations carry the\r\ncolony about, beneath which are various polyps and tentaclelike\r\nappendages, some to gather food, whose digested products circulate\r\nthrough the whole colony, others performing reproductive functions.\r\nThe variety of form is considerable; and one of the most peculiar,\r\nand the only siphonophore familiar to most persons, is the exquisite\r\nPortuguese man-of-war, whose prismatically tinted bulb, as big as\r\none's fist, is commonly met with in the Gulf Stream in the North\r\nAtlantic, and often is seen in great flocks in the tropics, bobbing on\r\nthe surface of the waves in calm weather. Beneath that bulb trails a\r\nlong tuft of tentacles and zooids, performing various functions, and\r\nso foreshadowing the division of labor that in the higher animals is\r\neffected by the different limbs and organs.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  SEA ANEMONES, CORALS, AND SEA FANS\r\n\r\nSea anemones are simply large polyps of more complicated structure\r\nthan the hydroid polyps. Instead of a simple, baglike, enteric cavity,\r\nthe slitlike mouth admits food into a flattened gullet which leads\r\nto an enlarged digestive cavity. The gullet does not hang free, but\r\nis joined to the outer wall of the body by a series of radiating\r\npartitions, between which shorter ones extend from the inner surface\r\nof the ectoderm; and below the gullet the stomach wall extends in lobes\r\nbetween these partitions, through which holes permit the nutritive\r\njuices to circulate throughout the whole body. The whole upper surface\r\nof the polyp is covered by short tentacles arranged in circles. A\r\ncurrent of water, induced by waving cilia, is constantly flowing in\r\nat one corner of the mouth and out at the other, supplying the animal\r\nwith oxygen and a certain amount of minute food, and carrying off\r\nwaste; but the anemones capture by means of their tentacles small\r\nfishes, mollusks and everything that can be caught and swallowed. As\r\nsome anemones exceed a foot in diameter, large and powerful prey may\r\nsometimes be taken. It is interesting to note that anemones distinguish\r\nvery quickly between what is good to eat and what is not. Most of them\r\nare sitting near shore on rocks or in tide pools, or are clinging to\r\nthe larger seaweeds or clustered on the supports of wharves where the\r\nwaves and tidal currents are continually washing about them, often with\r\nmuch violence, and dashing against them strands of weed or the small\r\nwreckage always floating in such a place. None of this is seized, or at\r\nleast is not swallowed; but whether we are to conclude that this choice\r\nis made by intelligence, or only by chemical perception is a matter for\r\nstudy. When harm threatens, or when they crave rest, they withdraw all\r\ntheir gorgeous tentacles, infold them within their mouth, and shrink\r\ndown into roundish gray lumps that attract neither the eye nor the\r\nappetite of any marauder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CORALS\r\n  Tree coral (_Dendrophyllia nigrescens_). Tuft coral (_Lophophyllia\r\n  prolifera_). Fan coral (_Euphyllia pavonia_). Cup corals and skeleton\r\n  (_Carophyllia smithii_).]\r\n\r\nThe coral polyps differ from anemones only in details of structure that\r\nwe need not consider, except to note the striking difference that here\r\nthe base and the radiating partitions instead of being membranous\r\nsecrete a firm skeleton either of lime or of the horny material termed\r\nchitin. The flesh overflows the walls, folding down from the top, so\r\nthat the skeleton becomes really internal, although naked at the broad\r\nbase. Some of the tropical stony corals are like big anemones, several\r\ninches across; and it is only when they infold all their richly colored\r\ntentacles and become a dull and shapeless lump that their stony cup is\r\nrevealed. These are solitary, and form loosely lying corals, like that\r\ncalled the \"mushroom.\" New ones are produced by the parent throwing\r\noff buds which for a time remain attached by a stalk, but finally fall\r\noff and settle down to grow--a process that may go on for a score of\r\nyears. In the case of the huge coral masses called madrepores the buds\r\nremain attached to the parent. If they spread out naturally, W. Saville\r\nKent explains, they build up by accumulation the large rounded masses\r\nknown as \"brain\" corals and \"star\" corals, which are most numerous\r\non coastline reefs, or form the base of the outer barrier reef. On\r\nthe other hand, where the budding is terminal, or oblique, branching,\r\ntreelike growths result in \"staghorn\" and similar forms.\r\n\r\nThe coral animals do not alone construct the reefs. Stony hydroids\r\n(millepores), shells of all sorts of mollusks, limy sea mosses\r\n(Bryozoa), animalcules and diatoms and various algæ stiffened or cased\r\nwith lime or flint, and blown sand, contribute to build them up,\r\nespecially when they near the surface of the sea.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of reef-building corals is interesting. At present\r\nthey are limited to about 35 degrees each side of the equator, but are\r\nirregularly distributed, owing mainly to differences of temperature in\r\nthe water, which must not be colder than 68 degrees F. Hence they exist\r\nfarther away from the equator in the path of warm ocean currents. The\r\nGulf Stream accounts for the coral islands along the coast of Florida\r\nand in the Bermudas, which is their farthest point on the American\r\ncoast; and the warmth of the water accounts for their extensive\r\npresence along the eastern coasts of Australia and Africa, when few\r\nexist on the western sides of these continents; similarly the western\r\ncoasts of South and Central America are nearly free of coral banks.\r\nOther causes of limitation exist. For example, the noticeable absence\r\nof coral growth along the coast of South America is largely, if not\r\naltogether, owing to the fresh water and silt brought down by the great\r\nrivers there--both prejudicial to coral life.\r\n\r\nCoral colonies increase and ultimately form banks wherever warm,\r\npure sea water is constantly present, and not more than about 125\r\nfeet deep. Here, spreading and continually rising on the skeletons\r\nof dead generations, they form a long line close to the land called\r\na \"fringing\" reef; and outside of this, beyond a space swept by the\r\ncurrents, may arise a second, still more flourishing bank, termed\r\n\"barrier\" reef. The great barrier reef that extends for 1,200 miles\r\nalong the eastern coast of Australia--a vast chain of banks and\r\nislands--is an amazing example of what these minute animals can\r\naccomplish, given time; and geology can point to still more stupendous\r\nresults of their work in the early history of the globe.\r\n\r\nVery characteristic, in the great coral-growing region of the South Sea\r\narchipelago, is the ring-shaped island or \"atoll,\" which incloses a\r\nquiet lagoon, usually with an open entrance. The reason for such a form\r\nhas excited much discussion, one explanation being that its origin was\r\nabout a small island that slowly subsided, the coral keeping pace in\r\nrising as the island sank, until finally the land disappeared; another\r\nthat the circular reef arose from a submerged elevation, and when it\r\ncame near the surface ceased to grow except on its outer border because\r\nit ceased to get suitable water and food, until after a time the\r\ncentral part died out, leaving a ring. Both explanations may be true of\r\ndifferent situations.\r\n\r\nWhen a reef comes near to the surface the branching coral is knocked to\r\npieces by the waves, and there are added to this breakage shells and\r\nbones, calcareous seaweeds, and what not; and all this is ground into\r\nsand by the surf, washed high on the top of the ridge and manured by\r\ndead plants and animals, and by the droppings of birds, until finally\r\na soil forms beyond the reach of the tides. Then, if it is in the far\r\nsouthern seas, a drifting coconut may lodge there and be rolled high\r\nenough to be left to strike its roots into the sand and begin the\r\ngrove that by and by will make the islet attractive to men. The thick\r\nhusk of the coconut resists harm from sea water, near which this palm\r\nprefers to grow in just such a sandy, shelly soil as the uprising reef\r\naffords. The nuts that so often fall into the surf or are carried\r\nout by rivers make long voyages without losing their vitality. Here,\r\nagain, the situation of most coral islets in the course of currents\r\nis advantageous, for thus not only these nuts but other useful seeds\r\nand colonizing elements drift directly to their doors, as it were.\r\nBirds, wandering widely over the waters, espy the bit of land, and\r\naid by their visits to increase its fertility and often add to its\r\nflora. Reefs near shore, especially in Florida and southward, become\r\njungles of mangroves, which not only spring from floating seeds but\r\nsend down from their branches sprouts that become rooted in the mud and\r\nspread the growth interminably. Such a \"mangrove key\" soon attracts\r\nan extensive population of plants and animals and speedily becomes a\r\nconsiderable island.\r\n\r\nA great variety of corals, however, are not reef builders, and some\r\nspecies secrete little if any lime; these solitary relatives are found\r\nscattered all over the oceans, in deep water as well as shallow,\r\nwherever the bottom is suitable, and an immense amount of interesting\r\ninformation about them is to be found in books devoted to this\r\nbeautiful group of animals.\r\n\r\nThe class includes two or three other orders of coral--polyps that\r\ngrow in a solitary way or in groups, forming those elegant objects\r\ncalled sea fans, sea pens, and so forth, which can be referred to\r\nonly briefly. One of these is the order Alcyonaria, in which some are\r\nsoft-bodied, others are strengthened by a network of spicules. A very\r\nbeautiful one is the \"sea pen,\" which takes the shape of an ostrich\r\nplume; another is the strange mass of parallel tubes called organ-pipe\r\ncoral; and some of them are very large, the great tree coral of the\r\neastern Atlantic depths being sometimes as tall as a man, while it\r\nlooks like a sturdy, leafless tree. As in all the others, however,\r\nit is covered by a living fleshy coat of protoplasmic substance\r\nstudded with polyps whose gay colors and waving tentacles give it the\r\nappearance of being clothed with minute sessile blossoms. The best\r\nknown of this group, probably, is the red coral of commerce, which\r\nis the scarlet, ivorylike interior stem of a branching alcyonarian\r\ncolony. This coral has from the earliest time been cut into cameos\r\nby lapidaries, as well as used for making necklaces and other toilet\r\nornaments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n                           UNINVITED GUESTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                    FLATWORMS, FLUKES AND TAPEWORMS\r\n\r\nThe phylum Platyhelminthes follows the coelenterates in the ascending\r\nseries of zoölogical classification, and includes a baneful company of\r\ncreatures badly called \"worms,\" which show none of the segmented or\r\nringlike form of body that characterizes the true worms of the phylum\r\nAnnulata to which we shall come presently. On the contrary, they are a\r\ngroup of small, soft-bodied, flattened animals, which first show that\r\ntwo-sided character, or bilateral symmetry, which has apparently been\r\nabsent from all the groups we have studied hitherto, whose members are\r\ncircular or globular in shape, and whose organs, in the adult, are\r\narranged radiately.\r\n\r\nThe simplest are the planarians (Turbellaria), which live a free\r\nlife, as a rule, although some are parasitic. They are little, thin,\r\nleaf-shaped creatures that creep on the bottom of ponds and even of\r\ndeep lakes, or swim in the sea, and feed upon algæ and minute animals.\r\n\r\nSimilar to them in appearance are the flukes (Trematoda), of which the\r\nbest known of a large variety is that which infests sheep. Most of the\r\ntrematodes are parasitic.\r\n\r\nThe third class of flatworms is the Cestoda, the members of which are\r\nuniversally parasitic, and are known principally as \"tapeworms\" in\r\nreference to their form.\r\n\r\nThe phylum Nematothelminthes contains an assemblage of related worms,\r\nsome marine, but mostly living in fresh waters or on land, which are\r\neellike in form, very slender, and often have amazing length. The first\r\nand lowest class is that of the nematodes, of which the minute \"vinegar\r\neels\" and \"paste eels\" are familiar examples. The remainder of the\r\nnematodes are parasitic, and many of them are dangerous parasites.\r\n\r\nIn an allied family and genus (Trichina) is placed one of the most\r\ndangerous of human parasites, the _Trichina spiralis_.\r\n\r\nHere, too, comes that \"hairworm\" (Gordius), which most country folks\r\ncall \"hair eel\" or \"hair snake.\" Many assert with the most positive\r\nfaith that if you will soak a horsehair in water it will \"turn into a\r\nsnake,\" and will show you this long threadworm in a horse trough to\r\nprove it. I never knew a cautiously made experiment in that direction\r\nto succeed; nevertheless the fanciful error survives. The gordius,\r\nwhich does look like a hair from a gray mare's tail, is somewhat\r\naquatic in its habits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n                      DWELLERS BETWEEN TIDE MARKS\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE COLONIAL MOSS ANIMALS\r\n\r\nSeaweeds and rocks at and below the limit of the ebbing tide are often\r\ncovered with small bushy growths, or with lacelike incrustations that\r\nare alive. These are moss animals, representing the class Polyzoa of\r\nthe phylum Molluscoida. They are minute, soft creatures that live in\r\ncolonies formed by the repeated budding of the members, all connected\r\nby a fleshy base so that each contributes to the nourishment of all.\r\n\"Each little animal occupies a separate stony or horny capsule, into\r\nwhich it may withdraw and even close the opening with a lid.... The\r\nmouth is surrounded by tentacles that in many species arise from a\r\nhorseshoe-shaped or disklike base. These tentacles are always beset\r\nwith hairlike bristles which by their movements serve to set up\r\ncurrents, and thus to drive minute organisms into the mouth.\"\r\n\r\nA typical example of these polyzoans (or bryozoans) is _Bugula\r\nturrita_, so abundant wherever our northeastern coast is rocky that\r\nthe rocks below tide level appear covered with its mossy tufts, which\r\nare often ten inches long and profusely branched. The main stems are\r\norange-yellow, while the terminal branches are yellowish white. The\r\ndelicate tracery so frequently seen on the fronds of kelp, and on\r\nshells and stones along both shores of the Atlantic indicate colonies,\r\nor their remains, of the lace coralline (Membranipora); and the dull\r\nred or pinkish crust so common on shells and stones in shaded tidepools\r\nrepresents successive colonies of the \"red-crust\" polyzoan (_Escharella\r\nvariabilis_), layer crusting over layer. A similar history accounts\r\nfor the curious nodules called \"false coral\" so common in moderately\r\ndeep water in Long Island Sound. Similar polyzoans, which exist in\r\ngreat variety, both modern and fossil, contributed extensively to the\r\nformation of the older strata of sedimentary limestones.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          ANCIENT LAMP SHELLS\r\n\r\nAssociated in structure with these minute colonists is the ancient race\r\nof brachiopods (Brachiopoda, \"arm-footed\") or lamp shells, although\r\nthey much more nearly resemble bivalved mollusks, whence, by the way,\r\ncomes the name of the phylum to which both belong--Molluscoida, which\r\nmeans \"mollusklike.\"\r\n\r\nThe race of the brachiopods goes back to the beginning of the geologic\r\nrecord. A few living examples are still found in the ocean, some of\r\nwhich, as lingula, have changed so little that they can hardly be told\r\nfrom the most ancient fossils of their family. Certain species are\r\ndredged abundantly on both coasts of the Atlantic from water a few\r\nfathoms deep where the bottom is rocky. They look like small mussels at\r\nfirst sight, but on examination show a vast difference in structure.\r\nThe bivalve shells, instead of growing on the right and left sides of\r\nthe animal, as in bivalve mollusks, cover its back and front, and the\r\nhead parts are at the gape of the valves. At the hinge end of the shell\r\nthe lower valve overlaps (it is the shape of this lower shell, like\r\nthat of an old Roman lamp, which suggests their common name, \"lamp\r\nshells\") and the hinder end of the body projects as a stalk, by which\r\nthe animal fastens itself to the rock. \"The mouth in the brachiopods is\r\nflanked by two curiously coiled and feathered arms which lie within the\r\ncavity between the shells, and are supported by skeletal rods attached\r\nto the upper shell. These serve as gills, and also to capture the\r\nminute creatures upon which the brachiopod feeds.\"\r\n\r\nOwing to their great abundance, world-wide distribution, and remote\r\nantiquity, as well as their excellent state of preservation,\r\nbrachiopods occupy a very conspicuous rank among extinct invertebrates,\r\nand furnish us besides with a large number of important index fossils.\r\nThey are to be found in immense variety from the Cambrian to the\r\npresent, most numerously in formations from Silurian to Permian times.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STARFISH AND OTHER TYPICAL LIFE IN A TIDE POOL\r\n  Photo, American Museum of Natural History]\r\n\r\n\r\n                 STARFISHES, SEA URCHINS, AND TREPANGS\r\n\r\nWe have now arrived at the point (phylum Echinodermata,\r\n\"spiny-skinned\") where a distinctly new type of interior structure\r\nappears in the possession by animals of a hollow space (coelom) between\r\nthe outer skin and the wall of the digestive tube which now becomes\r\noccupied by definite organs instead of by an almost uniform mesenchyme,\r\nas in the sponges and coelenterates. These organs arise from an\r\ninterior lining membrane called \"mesoderm.\"\r\n\r\nHenceforth, therefore, we shall deal with coelomate animals, among\r\nwhich the echinoderms are lowest in rank. The simplest of them is the\r\n\"sea lily\" which lives rooted on the bottom in deep water, and sways\r\nabout on a slender, jointed stalk, looking much like the flower after\r\nwhich it is named. It is of interest chiefly as a survivor of the tribe\r\nof crinoids that were so varied and numerous in early Paleozic times\r\nthat massive Devonian limestones are composed largely of their remains;\r\nand the type has changed little through the ages. It consists typically\r\nof a cup, mounted on its stem like the calyx of a flower, and composed\r\nof circles of calcareous plates, definite in form and in relative\r\nposition, that contain and protect a well-organized body. Surrounding\r\nthe open mouth of the cup is a circle of long, jointed, much-branched\r\ntentacles that sweep the water, capture passing prey, and bring it into\r\nthe mouth of the crinoid within the circling base of the arms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CORAL FORMATIONS OF THE GREAT BARRIER REEF, AUSTRALIA\r\n  Photo, American Museum of Natural History]\r\n\r\nIf now you were to cut off its stalk, lay the crinoid on the sand,\r\nmouth down and arms outspread, beside a brittle star or a basket fish,\r\nwhich also have many-branched arms, it might be difficult to tell them\r\napart, yet they represent different orders; and from this, by way of\r\nthe naked serpent star, it is but a short transition to the starfish,\r\nwhere the arms are no longer tentaclelike, but are simply pointed\r\nextensions of a central body; this, in fact, is the case, for now they\r\nare no longer prehensile organs, but are supports, mainly serviceable\r\nin locomotion, and the stomach and ovaries are partly lodged in them.\r\nThe main point just now, however, is the fact that here, and in the\r\nsuccessive changes of form to be shown, the pattern of plates that form\r\na strengthening mosaic in the skin of the central part of the body\r\nremains identical.\r\n\r\nAll starfishes are not as prettily symmetric as our familiar\r\nfive-finger. Some are shorter in the arms, and much broader and\r\nthicker in the body; and if you will examine a collection of preserved\r\nspecimens of the echinoderms you will see that you can trace gradation\r\nof form right around to the bun-shaped cake urchin, on whose top the\r\nfive-pointed star is printed, and thence to the globular sea egg,\r\nwhich the French called \"sea urchin,\" using one of their names for the\r\nhedgehog. Furthermore, the five sections of the shell of the urchin,\r\nwhich represent the five arms of the starfish folded forward and grown\r\ntogether into a spherical case, are to be traced again, outlined by\r\nappendages, in the elongated and leathery hide of the trepangs and sea\r\ncucumbers of the order Holothuria.\r\n\r\nIt is as an illustration of homology, that is, the resemblance between\r\nparts that have the same relation to the typical plan of structure,\r\nand as an example of how almost endless variations of form may arise\r\nwithin a single type, that the echinoderms are of most interest.\r\nOtherwise it may be said that they serve as food for fishes and some\r\nother creatures, including coastwise savages, and as curiosities in\r\ngeological museums and in aquaria; and that starfishes are sadly\r\ndestructive of cultivated oyster beds. We may therefore dismiss them,\r\nand devote a page or two to the worms.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       EARTHWORMS AND BEACHWORMS\r\n\r\nAlthough various parasitic creatures have been described as flat\r\n\"worms,\" round \"worms,\" and so forth, naturalists regard as true worms\r\nonly those of higher organization classified in the phylum Annulata, or\r\nannelids, the distinctive characteristic of which is that its members\r\nhave elongated bodies divided into ringlike sections. These represent\r\na division of the internal parts into a series of structural segments\r\nor \"matemeres,\" each supplied with its own set of organs, yet connected\r\nby blood vessels and nerves, and the whole traversed by tubular organs\r\nserviceable to the entire animal. The nervous system consists of a\r\n\"brain\" in the head, and a double, ventral nerve-cord with a ganglion\r\nin every segment, foreshadowing the nervous system in insects and other\r\narthropods. The phylum embraces three classes: 1. Chætopoda--earthworms\r\nand marine annelids; 2. Gephyrea--marine worms, otherwise called\r\nsipunculoids; and 3. Hirudinidæ--leeches.\r\n\r\nThe earthworm or \"angleworm\" (that is, angler's worm, bait worm)\r\nof the \"common garden variety,\" to use the phrase of old-fashioned\r\nencyclopedias, is a typical example of the first class, whose Latin\r\nname refers to the bristles (setæ) on the flattened lower surface of\r\nthe body that serve the worm as \"feet.\" A magnifying glass shows them\r\nin four double rows allowing eight to each of the rings into which the\r\nbody is so plainly divided; their extremities are directed rearward,\r\nand by their means the worm pushes itself along, and is able to cling\r\nto and climb not only the walls of its burrow but vertical surfaces\r\nwhen not too smooth. Thus they are found frequently on roofs and in\r\nother elevated and surprising places, to which they have crawled in\r\nthe night, when, as well as in warm, rainy weather, they are likely to\r\nwander a great deal. The long and greatly extensible and elastic body\r\ntapers almost equally at each end, but the head end is that which goes\r\nforward in crawling, and a lens will show a mouth on its lower surface,\r\nbeneath a sort of thick lip. A long gullet leads into an expansion\r\ncalled the crop, and that into a large, tough-walled stomach, beyond\r\nwhich an intestine leads to the last segment. The thirty-third to\r\nthirty-seventh segments are swollen, forming the \"belt\" (clitellum),\r\nwhich denotes maturity, but seems to have no special functions. The\r\nsenses are few and dull. No eyes exist, nor sense of hearing, but\r\nthe skin is extremely sensitive to vibrations, and to bright light,\r\nas might be expected in a nocturnal animal. The sense of taste is\r\ndiscriminating. The eggs are extruded in such a way as to form a\r\nglutinous ring about the body, which, when complete, is slipped over\r\nthe head of the worm, and left to hatch in warm soil under a stone.\r\n\r\nEarthworms live underground in burrows that are sunk well below the\r\nfrost line. In digging they work head downward, gnawing--although they\r\nhave no hard jaws--and swallowing the earth that is not easily crowded\r\naside and then throwing it out and perhaps heaping it up as \"castings.\"\r\nThe tunnel must be wide enough to let its occupant turn around in it,\r\nand it ends in a deep chamber in which one or more worms may pass the\r\nwinter without freezing. These worms naturally seek a loose, damp soil,\r\nnot only for ease of working, but because moisture is a necessity,\r\nas they breathe through their skin; hence they abound in meadows and\r\ncultivated soil, and are not found on high, dry plains. During the\r\nday they lie near the surface, often with the head just protruding.\r\nHere they are discovered by sharp-eyed birds and garter snakes, and\r\nsacrificed by thousands, notwithstanding the strength with which they\r\nhang on to their retreats by the tail. When it retires to the depths of\r\nits burrow this worm plugs the mouth of the tunnel with leaves which\r\nit draws always by the base, exhibiting considerable intelligence in\r\nmanipulating the various shapes of leaves to that end.\r\n\r\nThe world-wide distribution of the earthworm is to some extent owing\r\nto man's agency. On our northwestern plains, for example, these worms\r\noriginally were absent, but are now widely distributed and flourishing\r\nthere, having been carried from the east, as eggs or small worms, in\r\nthe soil packed about the roots of trees and shrubs transplanted to\r\nwestern orchards and gardens. This fact may have something to do with\r\nthe recent westward spread of the robin, which, more than any other of\r\nour birds, is a hunter of them. Except where excessively numerous these\r\nworms do far more good than harm in a garden.\r\n\r\nThe naids (Naidæ) are small transparent worms that creep about on\r\nvegetation in fresh water, and, besides laying large eggs, they\r\noccasionally divide into two at a place in the body that appears\r\narranged for this purpose, for it consists of a zone of very elementary\r\ntissue. \"Gradually,\" as Minot records, \"the tissue of this interpolated\r\nzone transforms itself into muscles, nerves, etc., and, growing\r\nmeanwhile, it forms in front a new tailpiece to patch out the anterior\r\nhalf of the worm, and behind it forms a new head for the posterior\r\nhalf of the original body. The zone then breaks and there are now two\r\nworms.\" A relative, the lumbriculus, does the trick in a much more\r\nprosaic way, breaking in two first, and letting the separate halves\r\nacquire head or tail as best they may. This ability to reproduce lost\r\nparts is of much service in the life of the species and often of the\r\nindividual, which may still live after some water tiger has bitten it\r\nin two--and these worms are at the base of the food supply of rivers\r\nand ponds, and would soon be exterminated were they not capable of\r\nrapid and profuse multiplication.\r\n\r\nWorms of this class dwell in great numbers and variety in the sea and\r\nin salt-water meadows and beaches, and are often beautiful as well as\r\ninteresting objects of study for the visitor at the shore. The sea\r\nmouse (Aphrodite), for instance, which is about three inches long and\r\nof oval shape, is covered with hairlike bristles that glisten with\r\nbrilliant green, red, and yellow iridescence; it is to be looked for on\r\nthe mud just below the low-tide line, and inhabits both coasts of the\r\nNorth Atlantic. The body of the common \"clay worm,\" dug for bait at low\r\ntide, which is olive in general tone, gleams with pearly iridescence,\r\nwhile its innumerable feet bear gills that are green and salmon-red.\r\nAnother (Lumbriconereis) is known as \"opal worm\" for good reason; and\r\nour sands abound in slender scarlet worms of the same genus named\r\n\"red thread.\" All these worms bury themselves in the sand, or wander\r\nthrough it in search of prey, for they are carnivorous, and do not\r\nhesitate to kill and eat each other. Some are fairly sedentary, and\r\nprotect themselves against fishes, crabs, mollusks, and bigger annelids\r\nthat seek them, by forming tubes by means in some cases of a shelly\r\nsecretion, but more usually by cementing bits of shell, stones, and\r\ngrains of sand into an irregular tube lining the burrow; the slender,\r\nlimy serpentine tubes often seen on stones or dead shells in tide\r\npools, are, or were, the homes of such protected worms, most commonly\r\nof the \"shell worm\" (Serpula). \"Often a number of these calcareous worm\r\ntubes are seen clustered together. When undisturbed the worm protrudes\r\nits beautiful feathered gills, which resemble a little passion flower\r\nprojecting from the mouth of the tube. These gills are variously\r\ncolored in different individuals, some being purplish brown, banded\r\nwith white and yellow, while others are yellowish green, orange, or\r\nlemon-yellow. At the least disturbance, such as a shock or a shadow,\r\nthe gills are instantly withdrawn into the stony tube, and the opening\r\nstopped by a horny disk.\" In the Gulf of Mexico extensive colonies of\r\nthese worms often form, and as the early generations die others erect\r\ntheir tubes above them; as this goes on sand and shell fragments fill\r\naround and between the tubes, and after a long time the whole mass\r\nbecomes a solid reddish, loose-lying rock, composed chiefly of serpula\r\ntubes, which in Florida is dragged up from the beach and used as\r\nbuilding stone.\r\n\r\nThe third class (Hirudinidæ) of Annulata is that of the leeches, those\r\nugly, but useful, worms of land and sea. In spite of their sluglike\r\nappearance the leeches are segmented worms, although the wrinkles on\r\ntheir gray, mottled skins do not indicate the position of the segments\r\nbeneath. The mouth on the under side of the head is armed with jaws\r\nand sharp teeth that make three or more cuts through the skin, whence\r\nthe blood is sucked; there is also a holding sucker near the tail.\r\nTheir attacks cause little pain, and that fact has led physicians to\r\nput them into use when bleeding is required. The eggs of leeches are\r\nlaid in moist earth in little packets, and hatch in five or six weeks.\r\nThe growth to maturity is slow, and continues during a long life. Many\r\nspecies abound in ponds and stagnant waters. Asia has terrestrial\r\nleeches, swarming in moist vegetation; and in Ceylon the minute\r\nleeches are a terrible plague in certain regions. Many also are wholly\r\nmarine. Some of the larger forms attack fishes directly, and quickly\r\nkill them by sucking their blood away; others are true parasites. On\r\nthe other hand the leeches of our lakes are fed on by the whitefish and\r\nsimilar fishes. They are a great pest to our fresh-water turtles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n                     BUILDERS OF THE PEARLY SHELLS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mollusks, or \"shellfish\" (phylum Mollusca) are a homogeneous\r\ngroup of soft-bodied, unsegmented, typically bilateral, elaborately\r\norganized animals, mainly aquatic and marine, whose origin--probably as\r\na derivative from a wormlike stock--is lost in the mists of geologic\r\nprehistory. In most cases the mollusks secrete from a larval gland\r\nan external shell which serves as skeleton and defensive armor; are\r\nbisexual and produce eggs, or if monoecious are never self-fertilizing.\r\nThey possess a heart, and blood circulation (usually colorless);\r\nbreathe in the water by means of gills, or, in the air, by a primitive\r\nkind of lung; have a nervous system and senses in some cases of a high\r\norder; the organs are normally paired, and protected by a general\r\ncovering integument called the \"mantle\"; and the creeping species move\r\nby a muscular, elastic, ventral organ styled the \"foot,\" while the\r\nswimmers are provided with a variety of swimming organs. Mollusks vary\r\nin size from all but microscopic minuteness to a bivalve weighing 500\r\npounds or a squid half as big as a right whale. They occur in all seas\r\nat all depths, abound in fresh waters both swift and stagnant, and are\r\nscattered over the earth wherever vegetation flourishes.\r\n\r\nThe phylum Mollusca is divided into five classes, as follows, and it\r\nwill be noticed that four of the names refer to the locomotive organ\r\nor \"foot\" (Greek _pous_, \"foot\"):\r\n\r\n\r\n    I. _Pelecypoda_, the Mussels--mollusks inclosed in a bivalve shell\r\n    fastened by a muscular hinge, the adjacent part of the valves being\r\n    generally more or less toothed; the foot is as a rule roughly\r\n    comparable to the shape of an ax head.\r\n\r\n    II. _Amphineura_, the Chitons--flattened, bisymmetrical mollusks\r\n    whose shell consists of eight crosswise, overlapping plates.\r\n\r\n    III. _Gastropoda_, Snails, whelks, etc.--mollusks that crawl on the\r\n    flat undersurface of the body, or distensible foot.\r\n\r\n    IV. _Scaphopoda_, Tusk shells--mollusks that possess a long tubular\r\n    shell open at both ends; with their small and elongated foot they\r\n    are supposed to _dig_ into the mud in which they live.\r\n\r\n    V. _Cephalopoda_, Cuttlefishes, and Octopods--mollusks with\r\n    tentaclelike \"arms\" arranged about the mouth, and either an external\r\n    or internal shell. These are the highest in rank.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE OYSTER AND ITS RELATIVES\r\n\r\nThe lowest in rank of these classes is the Pelecypoda, containing\r\nthe \"bivalves\"--mussels, clams, oysters, and the like, in which the\r\nshell is in two parts or valves hinged together over the \"back\" of\r\nthe animal, and attached to it on each side by a powerful muscle,\r\nthe \"adductor,\" by the contraction of which the shell may be tightly\r\nshut. Within the shell the body is enveloped in a \"mantle,\" or fleshy\r\nmembrane falling like a cloak on each side; and from it is secreted\r\nthe outer shell, which grows by additions to its ventral margin. These\r\nadditions are in a general way annual, so that the concentric lines of\r\ngrowth on its exterior are an indication of the years of the mollusk's\r\nlife, which is slow in growth, and long-lived. The interior of the\r\nshell is usually pearly, and marked with microscopic rugosities, which,\r\nby breaking up the light, as if by innumerable prisms, gives the\r\niridescence so beautiful in the pearl oyster, the fresh-water unios and\r\nmany others. These pearly layers are called \"nacre.\"\r\n\r\nBivalves were formerly classified in conchology as Acephala, because\r\nthey have no proper head, but at the posterior end are two openings of\r\ntubes, provided with cilia. In one, the cilia induce a constant current\r\nof water which after leaving the gills brings into the animal's stomach\r\nfloating microscopic food, both plants and animals, including eggs and\r\nlarvæ, where it is captured and assimilated while water is ejected\r\nthrough the other (dorsal) pipe. This food includes bacteria, and if\r\nthe mollusk lives and feeds in water polluted by sewage, or otherwise\r\ncontaining germs of disease, it becomes dangerous as human food; hence\r\noysters and clams exposed to such bad conditions ought never to be sent\r\nto market because of the disease germs remaining in them.\r\n\r\nIn bivalves such as the oysters, horse mussels, piddocks, and others\r\nthat are sedentary, and often fixed in place, or that, like river\r\nmussels, scallops, etc., move about freely, the mouth tubes are short;\r\nbut many bivalves, as the clams, pinnas, razor fish and so forth,\r\nbury themselves in the sand of the bottom, by means of the strong\r\ndistensible foot protruding from the forward end of the shell. These\r\nare provided with a double-barreled tube, called the \"siphon,\" which\r\nmay be contracted within the protection of the closed shell, or may\r\nbe stretched out several inches; the animal may thus sink its body\r\ndeep in the sand while its siphon reaches to the surface and inhales\r\nfood-bearing water. The little squirts of water often seen jetting\r\nout of the beach at low tide as one walks along it are from clams\r\nso buried, and which, alarmed by the vibration of one's footsteps,\r\nhastily eject the water and withdraw their siphons.\r\n\r\nThe old name for this class, Lamellibranchiata, referred to the gills,\r\ntwo of which, on each side, hang like curtains inside the mantle and\r\nbetween it and the saclike body containing the viscera; when the shell\r\nis open they are laved by the water, and extract from it, by some\r\nquality hardly understood, the oxygen necessary to regenerate the blood\r\nthat flows through them; and, in addition, respiration is carried on\r\nthrough the skin.\r\n\r\nThe nervous system is very primitive, and the sense organs consist of\r\nan otocyst (a minute sac in which a hard particle floats in a liquid)\r\nin the foot, by which, it is believed, a sense of direction is had,\r\nand which also serves the purpose of an ear; an organ that tests the\r\nwater; and in some, as the scallop, rudiments of eyes are situated on\r\nthe margin of the mantle. Most pelecypods are of two sexes, but some,\r\nsuch as our American oysters, are hermaphrodite. Eggs in vast number,\r\nand a cloud of spermatozoa, are thrown out in midsummer, and a little\r\nof the latter succeeds in reaching and so fertilizing fortunate eggs,\r\nbut almost all merely serve as food for the host of mollusks, worms,\r\nsea anemones and what not that subsist on such provender. The few\r\nfertilized larvæ drift about and happily escaping multiplied perils,\r\npresently settle to the bottom to attach themselves to some fixed\r\nobject, or otherwise get a chance to grow big enough to defy ordinary\r\nenemies. Some interesting variations in this rather commonplace larval\r\nhistory occur, however, in certain families.\r\n\r\nIt will be possible to name only a few of the most useful or otherwise\r\nconspicuous bivalves, beginning with the oyster, concerning which\r\nan immense amount of detailed information is accessible to the\r\nreader in the reports of the United States Government (Tenth Census,\r\nand documents issued by the Fisheries authorities) and in those of\r\nStates, like Connecticut, New York, and Maryland, where oyster culture\r\nis an extensive industry, said to be worth in the aggregate about\r\n$20,000,000. The oyster of the eastern American coast is to be found\r\nin the Gulf of St. Lawrence, but not in considerable numbers between\r\nthere and western Maine, whence it is present southward to the Gulf of\r\nMexico, except on the shifting sands of the outer beaches. It seeks\r\nprotected waters and a rocky or weedy bottom furnishing objects to\r\nwhich it may, when young, attach itself, and later will not be torn\r\nadrift by storms, for where an oyster establishes itself in infancy it\r\nmeans to stay all its life. Hence the sheltered waters of Buzzards and\r\nNarragansett Bays, Long Island Sound, and the lagoons and inlets that\r\nlie behind the outer line of sandy beaches from Long Island to Florida\r\nare the sources of our supply--especially Chesapeake Bay.\r\n\r\nA full-grown oyster will produce about 9,000,000 eggs, each being about\r\none five-hundredth of an inch in diameter. When the little oyster\r\n(spat) is about one-eighth inch wide shells begin to form on its\r\nsides, and it settles to the bottom with its left side down, usually\r\nwhere other oysters are; and hence extensive colonies, or \"reefs,\" of\r\nthese mollusks form, and \"rise on their dead selves\" to a level where\r\nthey may be reached by the oysterman's rake. Many years ago, however,\r\nit was discovered that large, marketable oysters were becoming very\r\nscarce. Oystermen therefore sought favorable places, and raking the\r\nnatural beds transplanted their catch, little and big, to new ground,\r\nwhere they were left to mature. This crude method was next improved\r\non by sowing thickly over the new ground, just before spawning time\r\nin midsummer, a great quantity of empty oyster and other shells.\r\nThese were favorable to the catching of \"spat,\" and would result in a\r\nnew bed that in about four years would furnish salable oysters; and\r\nannual plantings produced, after a time, an annual crop. These are the\r\nessential facts of oyster culture everywhere, although methods differ\r\nsomewhat in other parts of the world--in France, for example, fascines\r\nof twigs are spread over tidal flats to catch the spat, instead of\r\nshells.\r\n\r\nOur eastern American oysters are undoubtedly the largest and finest for\r\nthe table of the many species that exist all round the globe. Those of\r\nthe Pacific coast of the United States are excellent, but small; and\r\nthe same is true of the European species; nor is the use of oysters\r\nabroad so general and extensive as in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe pearl-bearing oysters are somewhat distant relatives of the edible\r\noyster (Ostræa), the thorny oysters (Spondylus), the hammer shell, the\r\nwindowglass shell (Placuna) and others. The pearl oyster of commerce is\r\nnamed _Meleagrina margaritifera_ and is found in scattered localities\r\nwithin the tropics on both continents. The chief fisheries are in the\r\nPersian Gulf, around Ceylon, in Australia, among the Sulu Islands\r\nand on the west coast of Panama. The Pearl Islands, south of Panama,\r\nyielded to the early Spanish adventurers riches in gems that rivaled\r\nthose their competitors obtained from gold mines; but now they are a\r\nfield of small importance. In fact, the pearl fishery is carried on\r\nnow far less in hope of a profitable collection of gems than for the\r\nprofit in the shells, which have a nacreous interior of remarkable\r\nbeauty--the mother-of-pearl--and the great advantage of offering this\r\nin almost flat surfaces, sometimes eight or nine inches broad, making\r\nit useful in the arts as well as in the more practical line of buttons,\r\nknife handles, etc. Sometimes the whole surface of a fine shell has\r\nbeen carved, cameowise, with cunning art and an exquisite effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n              BUILDERS OF THE PEARLY SHELLS--_Continued_\r\n\r\n\r\n                     MUSSELS, SCALLOPS AND CHITONS\r\n\r\nThe familiar marine mussels of the family Mytilidæ will some day become\r\nof great importance in this country as a food supply, as now they are\r\nuseful in resisting encroachment by the sea on certain parts of the\r\ncoast. They exist in vast numbers on both our coasts, and elsewhere in\r\nthe world, in two genera, Mytilus and Modiolus, which differ a little\r\nin form, but not in habits. They have acquired the stationary habit,\r\nand in place of a \"foot\" of serviceable size have developed a gland\r\nthat secretes an exceedingly tough, fibrous bunch of threads known as\r\na \"byssus,\" by means of which the animal may not only attach itself\r\nfirmly to any sort of object, but may actually move about. The common\r\nspecies of Modiolus, the \"horse mussel,\" lives in great numbers north\r\nof Cape Hatteras at and below the line of low water, and is much larger\r\nthan the edible mussel just described. A smaller species of Modiolus\r\nis extremely numerous on the New England coast, and down to the\r\nCarolinas, forming dense tangled beds on muddy patches as well as among\r\nrocks, and serving to bind the mud and plants together and hold them\r\nfrom disintegration by stormy waves, in spite of the thin and brittle\r\ncharacter of their shells. A southern species is bright yellow, with\r\ndark rays; and the common modiola of the Pacific coast is dark, glossy\r\nbrown. Such mussels are eaten regularly in Europe, and come to us in a\r\npickled condition as a luxury. There is no reason why we should neglect\r\nto add our own to our long list of sea foods.\r\n\r\nThe next useful mollusk to be considered is the scallop, one of\r\nthe many species of the family Pectinidæ, of which we eat only the\r\nadductor muscle. The commercial species is _Pecten irradians_, the name\r\nreferring to the (nineteen) ridges that radiate from the flattened\r\nhinges to the scalloped margin of the shell, which is prettily colored.\r\nThis species is common in sandy, shallow places from Cape Cod to\r\nFlorida, but the fishery is most productive about the eastern end of\r\nLong Island and in Narragansett Bay. Farther north is a very much\r\nlarger species (_P. islandicus_) especially abundant on the Grand\r\nBanks, off Newfoundland, where it forms an important food of the cod\r\nand other fishes. It is well known to cooks, who use it in baking\r\ntheir fish confections _en coquille_. A large number of other species\r\nare distributed throughout the world, one (_P. jacobæus_), inhabiting\r\nthe Mediterranean having the name \"pilgrim shell\" in allusion to the\r\nfact that in the days of medieval religious pilgrimages, those who had\r\nvisited the shrine of Saint James at Santiago de Compostela, Spain, to\r\npay homage on July 25, were accustomed to wear a scallop shell in their\r\nhats in token of the fact--this mollusk being connected with traditions\r\nof that saint.\r\n\r\nTurning to the fresh-water mussels, or naids, as some books call\r\nthem, one is staggered to learn that more than 1,500 species have\r\nbeen named, a large proportion of which belong to the United States,\r\nwhich is peculiarly hospitable to them because of our many rivers and\r\nlakes, together with the prevalence of limestone rocks, whose constant\r\ndissolution in water supplies the store of calcareous matter that these\r\nthick-shelled mollusks require. All belong to the family Unionidæ, in\r\nwhich two divisions are noted--one (Anodon) in which the mussel has a\r\ncomparatively elongated thin shell with no \"teeth\" in the hinges; and\r\nthe other (Unio) in which the shell is thick, various in shape from\r\nan oval to a triangle, and has prominent umbones, beneath which the\r\nvalves (which are always alike) are hinged together by interlocking\r\nteeth embedded in a somewhat elastic gristle. The interior of all these\r\nunios is richly nacreous, and consequently pearls are produced in the\r\nsame way as in the marine pearl-bearing shells; and some of the finest\r\nknown gems have been derived from them, in this country and abroad, as\r\nwell as innumerable specimens of moderate value. These mollusks like\r\nclear streams or lakes with a sandy bottom, and are not to be looked\r\nfor in stagnant weedy waters. They keep an erect position, the nibs of\r\nthe shell half buried in the sand, and move slowly about, plowing a\r\npath and dragging themselves along by means of the powerful foot, but\r\nkeeping the short siphons at the other (or longer) end of the shell\r\nwell above the mud.\r\n\r\nWe come next to our market clams. These are of two distinct\r\nkinds--\"hard\" and \"soft,\" or quahog and long clam, as they are\r\ndistinctively called. The quahog is a thick-shelled, roundish mollusk\r\nwith a distinctly heart-shaped outline when looked at endwise. It\r\ndwells in fairly deep water, standing on its nibs half buried in the\r\nsand, like a wedge, and moving slowly about. Young ones become the\r\n\"little necks\" of our summer tables.\r\n\r\nThe soft clam belongs to a different race. Its elongated shell is thin\r\nand chalky, is loosely hinged, and gapes widely at both ends, and\r\nalthough it is used much as food, especially in chowders, it is by no\r\nmeans as good as the hard clam. Its principal value, indeed, is as\r\nbait in the cod fisheries, and for this purpose enormous quantities\r\nare gathered. It lives in, rather than on, muddy beaches, sometimes\r\nin crowds of thousands, its shell deeply buried, and its long siphons\r\nreaching up to suck in water and food when the tide covers the flat.\r\nWhen the tide is out, a tiny hole in the sand and a spurt of water show\r\nthe clammer where to dig, and his spade quickly unearths the clam.\r\n\r\nThe second class, Amphineura, contains the chitons and their relatives.\r\nThese chitons are flattened mollusks protected by an armature of eight\r\ncrosswise plates, overlapping like shingles, which creep about the\r\nrocks close to shore, and when lifted curl up like sowbugs. The most\r\ninteresting thing about the chitons is the fact that they are provided\r\nwith excellent visual organs, \"the whole dorsal surface of some forms\r\nbeing studded with eyes, of which not less than 8,000 occasionally\r\nexist on a single specimen.\" Many of them are complete, with cornea,\r\nlens, and a pigment layer within the iris.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     SNAILS AS TYPES OF GASTROPODS\r\n\r\nThe gastropods (Gastropoda), including the snails and slugs, limpets,\r\nwhelks, periwinkles, sea hares and the like, are Mollusca having the\r\nmantle completely enveloping the body, and the shell, when present, in\r\na single piece, and usually in spiral form. There is a well-developed\r\nventral foot, on which the animal creeps, and in front of it a distinct\r\nhead bearing eyes and tentacles. These organs retain their normal\r\nbilaterality, but the body is, as a rule, inequilateral. The cause\r\nof this is the fact that on the animal's back is developed from the\r\nfirst a shell, which, with its contents, amounts to a relatively\r\nlarge weight, and it naturally falls over to one side. The mouth is\r\narmed with a flat, distensible, ribbon-like organ, studded with rows\r\nof chitinous teeth, that serves as a rasp and a boring instrument,\r\nand which is called an odontophore, or, in snails, a radula. Most\r\ngastropods are carnivorous.\r\n\r\nThe lowest in rank are the shell-less, or \"naked\" gastropods known as\r\n\"sea slugs,\" \"sea hares,\" and so forth. One Mediterranean species of\r\nAplysia secretes a purple liquid utilized by the ancients as a dye, and\r\nthis is still sought for in Portugal, where storms sometimes cast vast\r\nquantities of the mollusk on the beaches.\r\n\r\nWe come now to the great group of mollusks inhabiting fresh waters\r\nand dry land--the snails, whose group name is \"pulmonates,\" that is,\r\npossessors of lungs, and breathing air. On the generally accepted\r\ntheory that all these are descended from marine ancestors, and have\r\ngradually acquired the faculty of living on land, it would be natural\r\nto look for a series of mollusks that were amphibious, and, as it were,\r\nhalf-way fitted for a terrestrial existence, and such intermediates\r\nexist in all parts of the world. The little black Melampus, which\r\ncovers the mud of tide flats on both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts\r\nin tens of thousands, and seems just as happy when the tide is out as\r\nwhen it is in, or when it is simply refreshed by the spray, is a good\r\nexample. A near relative, Carychium, is still more emancipated from the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nFirst among these pulmonates are those common in ponds and still\r\nstreams the world over, of the family Limneidæ, called limneids or pond\r\nsnails. They are in various forms. Some are limpet-shaped (Ancylus),\r\nsome are flatly coiled (Planorbis), but most of them have shells drawn\r\nout into a graceful spiral; in all cases the shell is not composed of\r\nlime, but of the thin, fragile, horny substance \"chitin.\" The best\r\nknown one is _Limnea stagnalis_, which sometimes reaches a length of\r\ntwo inches, and inhabits almost every quiet piece of water in North\r\nAmerica, and in Europe and all Asia except India and China.\r\n\r\nThese water snails of our ponds and ditches are exclusively vegetable\r\nfeeders, and must come to the surface at frequent intervals to breathe,\r\nletting out a bubble of vitiated air, and taking in a fresh supply.\r\nShould the pond dry up in summer the limneids burrow down into the mud,\r\nand remain in that heat trance called æstivation until the autumnal\r\nrains refill the basin and let them come forth. The small kinds\r\ncalled \"physas,\" exceedingly common everywhere in this country and\r\nEurope, differ from Limnea in having the shell partly enveloped in the\r\nturned-up fringed edges of the mantle, and by being coiled from right\r\nto left instead of clockwise. This reversal occasionally occurs in\r\nindividuals of all gastropods, which are then said to be \"sinistral,\"\r\nas opposed to the normal \"dextral\" coiling; but in the physas it is the\r\nrule.\r\n\r\nNext come the wholly terrestrial pulmonates--snails and slugs,\r\ndistinguished from the pond snails, which have only one pair of\r\ntentacles at the bases of which the eyes are embedded in the skin,\r\nby having two pairs of \"horns,\" one of which carries the eyes on\r\ntheir tips--good eyes, which may be quickly withdrawn out of harm's\r\nway by inversion of the tubular stalks. The thick, extensible foot is\r\nsurmounted by a body coiled within the shell; and this foot secretes a\r\nviscid fluid that lubricates the creature's path, and often leaves a\r\nsilvery trail.\r\n\r\nSnails are mainly vegetarians. The mouth lies just under the front\r\ntentacles, and its upper lip is armed with a horny, crescentic \"jaw.\"\r\nWithin the mouth is the lingual ribbon, which may be brought up\r\nagainst the cutting edge of the jaw. This tongue is studded with rows\r\nof infinitesimal, flinty teeth, the radula of our big white-lipped\r\nsnail, a quarter of an inch long, furnishing room for 11,000 of these\r\ndenticles; and as all of them point backward the tongue easily seizes\r\nand draws into the mouth whatever the jaw nips off. Substantially\r\nthe same sort of \"tongue\" is possessed by all the gastropods, but\r\nthe arrangement and shape of the microscopic denticles is different\r\nin every species, and this is one of the \"characters\" used in\r\nclassification. With it the carnivorous rasp away their food; and by\r\nbending it double and using it as a gimlet bandits like Nassa, the\r\noyster pest, drill through other shells and devour the occupant. You\r\nmay pick up on any seabeach scores of examples of the work of these\r\nborers. In Europe some kinds of slugs and snails do great damage in\r\ngardens, but we have little to complain of in this respect.\r\n\r\nLargely dependent on moisture, the young snails that are hatched in\r\nmidsummer at once seek retreats, and may be looked for under leaves,\r\nlogs, and loose stones in the woods and pastures. Most American\r\nsnails are solitary, and will be found lurking in the moss beside\r\nmountain brooklets--a favorite spot for the glassy vitrinas--hiding\r\nin the crevices of rocky banks and old walls, crawling at the edge\r\nof swampy pools, creeping in and out of the crannies of bark on aged\r\ntrees, or clinging to the underside of succulent leaves. Some forms,\r\nvery beautiful in their ornamentation when magnified, are so minute\r\nthat they might be encircled by the letter o in this type, yet you\r\nwill soon come to perceive them amid the grains of mud adhering to the\r\nundersurface of a soaked chip or rotten log.\r\n\r\nFor fresh-water species various resorts are to be searched. Go to\r\nthe torrents with rocky bottoms for the paludinas and periwinkles\r\n(Melania); to quiet brooks for physas and coil shells (Planorbis); for\r\nlimneas to the reeking swamps and weedy ponds. By pulling up the weeds\r\ngently, you may get small species that otherwise easily escape your\r\ndipper or net. In the Southern States and in the tropics certain forms\r\nare to be picked off bushes and mangrove trees like fruit, especially\r\nthe round \"apple snails\" (Ampullaria) as big as your fist.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     SEA SHELLS IN NATURE AND ART\r\n\r\nOther familiar forms of gastropods are the limpets, keyhole and\r\nhalf-deck; the abalones, so much used in the making of ornaments; and\r\nthe many small sorts of \"periwinkles\" studding the rocks and hiding\r\namong the seaweeds of every coast. Then there are the pyramidal top\r\nshells (Trochus), the bulging, wide-mouthed turbans (Turbo), and the\r\nopen-whorled wentletraps (Scalaria) which years ago were so rare that\r\ncollectors paid $100 or more for a good specimen. The two former\r\nkinds are on sale in all seaside shops, with the natural rough brown\r\nexterior ground away until they gleam outside in the prismatic glory\r\nof the nacre layers that lie underneath. A group of heavy shells of\r\ncarnivorous tropical mollusks furnishes ornaments for the mantelshelf\r\nalso. These include the knobby volutes, often richly colored in\r\nmarbled patterns or in spiral rows of round spots; the olives, whose\r\novate shells are sometimes dark purple, sometimes beautifully marked,\r\nand always glossy, because enfolded during life inside flaps of the\r\nmantle that completely protect them; the miters, that take their name\r\nfrom their resemblance in shape to the headdress of a bishop, and\r\nshow splendid decorations in tints of red and orange; and the strong,\r\nspiny murexes, a small Mediterranean species, which is the principal\r\nsource from which the ancients derived their Tyrian purple dye--a\r\ncoloring matter yielded by treatment of the blood of many species,\r\nincluding one of the commonest little mollusks (Purpura) on our own\r\ncoast, which old-fashioned New Englanders yet utilize sometimes for\r\nmaking an indelible ink for marking clothing. To this family belong the\r\n\"drills\" that destroy thousands of dollars worth of oysters annually\r\nin Long Island Sound by boring through them. Near relatives are the\r\nwhelks (Buccinum), extensively eaten in England; and two of the largest\r\nand commonest shells on our eastern sand beaches, known to northern\r\nfishermen as \"winkles\" and along the southern coast as \"conchs.\"\r\nThese (Fulgur and Sycotyphus) are big, pear-shaped creatures with\r\nchalky white shells that crawl about near shore, seizing and devouring\r\nanything they can overcome, and working havoc on planted oyster beds;\r\nthey deposit their eggs in parchmentlike capsules shaped like gun wads\r\nand connected into a long chain that are often thrown up on the beach,\r\nwhere they are called sea necklaces.\r\n\r\nOf great beauty in their rich variety of color and pattern are the\r\ntropical cone shells, of which a large number of species are known,\r\nsome so rare as to bring great prices in the conchological market.\r\nTheir bite is poisonous. Equally numerous in species are the charmingly\r\ndecorated auger shells, some (Pleurotoma) spindle-shaped, others\r\n(Terebra) that would serve as models for a church spire. Near them is\r\nclassified that white mollusk (Natica) whose globular shell is perhaps\r\nthe commonest relic of the sea seen on our northern beaches, and\r\nsometimes is as large as a man's fist; to it belong the curious \"sand\r\nsaucers\" to be found in August, which contain its eggs. These naticas\r\nare predatory, and burrowing their way through the loose sand come upon\r\nand devour other shellfish, boring a circular, nicely countersunk hole\r\nthrough their armor and feeding on its inmate; their depredations on\r\nthe northern oyster beds are a serious matter.\r\n\r\nWell known and always admired are the cowries, smooth, brightly colored\r\nshells, shaped like an olive with a gash down the length of one side.\r\nThis long and narrow aperture is usually toothed, and it is only in the\r\nyoung that any indication of a typical spiral growth is discernible.\r\nThe money cowrie of Africa is small and cream-white.\r\n\r\nLastly a word must be said about the largest of known gastropods, the\r\nbig \"conchs\" or wing shells (Strombus), the helmet shells (Cassis),\r\nand the tuns (Dolium). They are West Indian. The species most commonly\r\nseen in the United States, forming a border for flower beds in seaside\r\nvillages, is _Strombus gigas_, with a delicate orange-red or pink\r\ninterior, from which are cut most of the shell cameos offered to art\r\nlovers. This shell, like the great spiral triton of the South Seas, is\r\nalso converted into a horn much used in foggy weather by the spongers\r\nand small coasters of Floridian and West Indian waters. The helmet\r\nshell, a heavy, rounder and smoother mollusk than the Strombus, is also\r\nextensively used in cameo cutting, especially the African black helmet,\r\nin which a white outer layer covers an almost black underlayer on the\r\nbroad lip. Dolium has a large, globose but thin shell, ornamented with\r\nrevolving ribs.\r\n\r\nThe class Scaphopoda is composed of a single family (Dentalidæ) known\r\nas tusk shells, because the little shells, one to two inches long, are\r\nshaped like an elephant's tusk, open at both ends. The structure of the\r\noccupant is so singular, the animal lacking head, heart, gills, and\r\nsome other ordinary features, that naturalists believe it is a hopeless\r\ndegenerate. One of the species of the Pacific coast is famous as the\r\nshell strung as ornaments and serving practically as money among the\r\nnorthwestern Indians until very recent times, under the name \"hiqua.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                    NAUTILUS, DEVILFISH, AND SQUID\r\n\r\nWe have now arrived at the last and highest division of the\r\nMollusca--the Cephalopoda, the class of the nautilus, ammonite, and\r\nother fossil forms, and of the squid, cuttles, and octopuses of our\r\nmodern seas. The cephalopods are very different in shape, activity, and\r\nin their higher organization and intelligence, from other mollusks,\r\nbut their general anatomy is the same. The special characteristic,\r\nas indicated by the name, is the fact that the head is surrounded by\r\ntentaclelike extensions of the \"foot,\" which is here fused in part\r\nwith the head, and divided into the long \"foot arms,\" which are the\r\ninstruments by which these predatory creatures obtain their prey. The\r\nunderpart of the foot forms a tube called the funnel (or siphon).\r\nThrough the funnel the animal expels water from the mantle cavity, and\r\nthus propels itself through the water. When the siphon is in its normal\r\nposition the animal swims backward; but it can be turned back over\r\nthe edge of the mantle, giving a forward movement. In cephalopods the\r\nsexes are separate, the male being often much smaller than the female.\r\nThe eggs are usually laid in gelatinous capsules, commonly known in\r\nNew England as \"sea grapes,\" and the development is direct, that is,\r\nwithout any free-swimming larval stage.\r\n\r\nThe class is divided into two subclasses: 1. _Tetrabranchiata_,\r\ncephalopods with four plumelike gills inside the mantle; and 2.\r\n_Dibranchiata_, with only two such gills. In the first subclass belong\r\nall those very ancient cephalopods called in a general way ammonites,\r\ngoniatites, orthoceratites, etc., that are found in such great numbers\r\nand astonishing variety in the Paleozoic rocks, from the Ordovician\r\nage onward, although but few groups survived beyond the Carboniferous\r\nperiod, and only two families can be traced as high as the Tertiary\r\ndeposits, one of which--that of the nautilus--survives to the present\r\nday as the final remnant of one of the conspicuous and interesting\r\npopulations of the primitive ocean.\r\n\r\nThe pearly or chambered nautilus is one of several species inhabiting\r\nthe East Indies and the coral region of the South Pacific seas,\r\ncreeping along the bottom in deep water, most numerously at the\r\ndepth of about 1,000 feet. Hence the animal is not often taken\r\nalive, although the smoothly coiled and handsome shells are cast\r\non the beaches in great numbers; and little is known of its habits\r\nor embryology. It is a soft lumpish sort of creature, with a great\r\nnumber of short arms and tentacles around the mouth, none armed with\r\nsuckers. It begins life as a mere globule covered by a minute hood of\r\nshell; but presently, growing too large for this hood, it enlarges it\r\nby additions to the rim, and then forms behind its body a partition\r\n(septum) across the shell, cutting off the part in which it was born.\r\nAs growth advances, this enlarging and partitioning continues until the\r\nnautilus has attained its full size. Then, as before, it occupies only\r\nthe outermost chamber, behind which the whole interior of the shell is\r\ndivided by the septa into chambers, abandoned and empty, but filled\r\nwith a gas that buoys it up in the water. Oriental artists are fond of\r\ngrinding away the dull exterior of the shell and exposing the gleaming\r\nnacre underneath; and of carving in this mother-of-pearl picturesque\r\ndesigns, examples of which are often to be seen in curiosity shops.\r\nThis is not only the last remnant of the great group of ancient\r\nnautiloids, but one of the smallest, for some of the Paleozoic coiled\r\nforms were as big as a washtub, and the straight ones were often six\r\nfeet long.\r\n\r\nThe Dibranchiata, on the other hand, are comparatively modern, as their\r\nancestry dates back only to the Trias, and our seas still harbor a long\r\nlist of living representatives. This subclass has two divisions: 1.\r\nOctopoda--octopods, the eightarmed argonaut and other octopuses; and\r\n2. Decapoda--decapods, the ten-armed cuttlefishes, or calamaries, and\r\nthe squids.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CHAMBERED NAUTILUS--SECTION\r\n  _H_, Head. _T_, Tentacles. _E_, Eye. _M_, Muscles. _S_, Shell. _A_,\r\n  Air Chambers]\r\n\r\nThe octopods have a saclike body with eight arms of about equal size,\r\nin some kinds thick and short, in others long and snaky. Every arm has\r\nalong its underside a double row of round, muscular suckers without\r\nhorny rims; and whatever is seized by one or more of these arms is\r\ndrawn into the mouth at their base, where it is bitten by a beaklike\r\njaw of sharp horn, and further devoured by means of a toothed tongue\r\nsimilar to the radula of gastropods. Nearly all are tropical, but some\r\nspecies exist in deep water considerably to the northward. Certain\r\nspecies are used as food in many parts of the world, and are considered\r\na delicacy in Italy and other Mediterranean countries. The fishermen\r\nof Japan and the Philippines capture them by the simple process of\r\nlowering big earthen urns and leaving them on the bottom overnight;\r\nwhen they are hauled up in the morning many will contain entrapped\r\ndevilfish, as sailors call them, which at once go to market.\r\n\r\nA very singular octopod is the little argonaut, or \"paper sailor.\" Its\r\nbody is not larger than a walnut--that is the body of the female, for\r\nthe male is only a tenth of that bigness. Its home is mainly in the\r\ntropics and in deep water, but in the summer spawning season it rises\r\nto the surface, and is occasionally met with far northward on the Gulf\r\nStream, drifting, apparently, in a snug little boat. The two dorsal\r\narms are expanded into broad, roundish membranes at their ends, and old\r\nstories said that they were used as sails--a supposition of much use to\r\npoets; but the \"boat,\" shaped somewhat like the shell of the nautilus,\r\nis not a shell proper, but a membranous pouch secreted by the mantle in\r\nspawning time, and not vitally attached to the body, but held in place\r\nbeneath it by the two broadened arms, and serving as a receptacle for\r\neggs and a cradle for the embryos hatching from them.\r\n\r\nTurning now to the Decapoda, we treat of things much nearer home and\r\nfamiliar on both sides of the continent, for these are the cuttlefish\r\nand squids, none of which have an external shell, but possess an\r\ninterior brace to their muscles either of lime or of chitin. The\r\ncuttlefish proper, or calamaries, are those of the family Sepiadæ,\r\nwhich have an oval, flattened body bordered by a fin; and two of the\r\nten arms are, in the female, in the form of long, slender tentacles.\r\nIn addition to being edible and easy to get, as they stay near shore,\r\ntheir calcareous back brace is the \"cuttlebone\" fed to cage birds; and\r\nthey furnish the substance from which the drawing ink called \"sepia\"\r\nis made--principally in Rome. This is a brownish black liquid that the\r\nanimal jets out through its siphon when it thinks itself in danger in\r\norder to make an inky cloud in the water behind which, as a sort of\r\nsmoke screen, it may run and hide. Other cephalopods use this means of\r\nescape.\r\n\r\nThe squids, however, are all elongated in shape, and have finlike\r\nexpansions of the mantle only on the tail. Two of their arms are long\r\nand slender, and are broadened at the tips, and studded with suckers.\r\nThese suckers in some squids are strengthened by a horny rim, or by\r\nrecurved hooks, or by both. The eyes are large, perfectly formed,\r\nand as serviceable as those of the fishes on which they prey. These,\r\nand some other animals, including small ones of their own kind, they\r\ncapture by darting backward, swinging quickly to one side and seizing\r\nthe victim in their sucker-bearing arms. They themselves are devoured\r\nby whales, seals, and many kinds of fishes; and enormous quantities\r\nof squids of various species are annually collected by fishermen for\r\nuse as bait in the Newfoundland fisheries. In place of the calcareous\r\ncuttlebone of the sepia the squids have their bodies stiffened by an\r\ninternal strip of chitinous substance called the \"pen.\"\r\n\r\nSquids are of all sizes from an inch to twelve feet in length; then\r\nthere is a surprising jump to the giants (Architeuthis) of the North\r\nAtlantic, which, when the tentacles are stretched out in front, may\r\nmeasure seventy-five feet from tip to tail. These are little different\r\nin structure or habits from their smaller brethren that exist in so\r\nmany species near all coasts and throughout the midseas right around\r\nthe globe; but their huge size makes them fit antagonists of the sperm\r\nwhale, which hunts them, and whose hide often bears a record, left by\r\ntheir powerful suckers, to show how hardly some big squid struggled\r\nfor life. These monsters are the greatest invertebrates known in\r\npresent or past time; and it is probable that the long wriggling arms\r\nof one and another, glimpsed at the surface, may account for some of\r\nthe sea serpent stories brought home by apparently perfectly honest\r\nsailors, especially those which in many cases recount that the supposed\r\n\"serpent\" was in conflict with a whale. Carcasses of these gigantic\r\nsquids are occasionally cast on the shores of Labrador and Greenland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n                      ANIMALS WITH JOINTED FRAMES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe phylum Arthropoda embraces an immense assemblage of small animals,\r\ninhabiting salt and fresh waters, the land, and the air above it.\r\nThe typical members of this group have a body divided into segments,\r\njointed limbs, some of which are modified into jaws, and a more or\r\nless firm external skeleton. The general organization is complex,\r\nwith the nervous system and senses well developed, in some divisions\r\nshowing powers of perception and brainwork of a very high order. The\r\nchief divisions, or classes, of the Arthropoda are given below in the\r\norder of rank, from those simplest in organization to the most complex.\r\nMembers of the first three classes breathe by gills, and are termed\r\nBranchiata, the remainder are air breathers or Tracheata.\r\n\r\n    _Crustacea_--Crabs, lobsters, shrimps, barnacles, beach fleas.\r\n    _Trilobita_--Trilobites; eurypterids (fossil only).\r\n    _Xiphosura_--Horseshoe crabs.\r\n    _Onychophora_--Peripatus.\r\n    _Myriapoda_--Centipedes; millipedes.\r\n    _Arachnoidea_--Spiders, mites, ticks, scorpions.\r\n    _Insecta_--Insects.\r\n\r\nAs several of these classes contain many subdivisions, and thousands\r\nor even tens of thousands of species, all that is possible is to give\r\nthe reader such an account of each important group, as will enable him\r\nto assign to their proper place such arthropods as he may encounter in\r\nhis rambles, or in his reading, and to learn something of the manner of\r\nlife in the various groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    CRABS AND THEIR SMALL RELATIVES\r\n\r\n\"Everyone,\" says Dr. Calman, \"has some acquaintance with the animals\r\nthat are grouped by naturalists under the name Crustacea. The edible\r\ncrabs, lobsters, prawns, and shrimps are at least superficially\r\nfamiliar, either as brought to the table, or as displayed in the\r\nfishmonger's.... Many, however, will be surprised that the barnacles\r\ncoating the rocks on the seashore, the sand hoppers of the beach, and\r\nthe wood lice of our gardens, are members of the same class. Still\r\nless is it suspected that the living species of the group number many\r\nthousands, presenting strange diversities of structure and habit, and\r\nplaying an important part in the general economy of nature.\"\r\n\r\nThe great majority of crustaceans are aquatic animals, breathing by\r\ngills or by the general surface of the body, having two pairs of\r\n\"feelers,\" or antennæ, on the front part of the head, and at least\r\nthree pairs of jaws. Most crustaceans are hatched from eggs, usually\r\nin a form very different from their parents; and they reach the adult\r\nstate only after passing through a series of transformations quite\r\nas remarkable as those that a caterpillar undergoes in becoming a\r\nbutterfly. All crustaceans, except a few much modified land forms,\r\nbreathe by means of feathery or platelike gills which are always\r\nan appendage of the legs, where they appear as one or more lobes.\r\nColorless blood propelled by the heart wanders into spaces in these\r\nlobes, and there lies separated from the water by a mere film\r\nof tissue, through which oxygen is absorbed from the water. Most\r\ncrustaceans are covered, at least in part, by some sort of shelly coat\r\ncomposed of a combination of the horny substance \"chitin\" with lime,\r\nwhich reaches its highest state in the big lobsters and crabs. This not\r\nonly protects and gives support to the internal organs, but also to the\r\nmuscles by which the animal moves. In other words it plays the part of\r\na skeleton. As it does not increase in size after it is once formed,\r\nand cannot stretch much, the crab must cast its shell at intervals\r\nas it grows. The new covering, which had been formed underneath the\r\nold, before molting, is at first quite soft, and the animal rapidly\r\nincreases in size owing to the absorption of water. The shell then\r\ngradually hardens by the deposition of lime salt.\r\n\r\nThe reader who may not hitherto have understood the difference between\r\n\"hard\" and \"soft-shelled\" crabs is now instructed; and it is observable\r\nthat the figurative expression \"a hard-shell,\" when applied to a man,\r\nsignifies that he must undergo a complete change before his ideas will\r\nbe enlarged.\r\n\r\nThe simplest of the crustaceans are those small creatures of the\r\nsubclass Branchiopoda (gill-footed) that swarm in our waters, both\r\nsalt and fresh. Lakes, ponds and ditches abound in a variety of minute\r\nor even microscopic species that, in gathering food from equally\r\nsmall bits of dead organic matter, as well as from living plants and\r\nanimalcules, perform an important service as scavengers--a service,\r\nin fact, performed by all crustaceans in a greater degree than by any\r\nother single group of animals. They also furnish the basis of food\r\nfor the whole body of aquatic life, since it is upon these minute\r\ncrustaceans that fish fry, tadpoles, insect larvæ, caddis flies, and\r\nso on, must mainly depend. One of them is Daphnia, familiar to keepers\r\nof aquariums. Another is Cyclops, a favorite with microscopists and\r\nabundant in stagnant ponds, which is a member of the group called\r\ncopepods that form an important part of the oceanic plankton, where\r\nthey are the chief consumers of the minute algæ; but they also occur\r\nat all depths. In arctic waters the copepods are so abundant that\r\nthey form the principal part of the food of certain fishes and of the\r\nwhalebone whales. These, and their minute relatives, the ostracods,\r\nproduce a large part of the phosphorescence of the sea, and some of\r\nthem exhibit bright colors.\r\n\r\nAll these are free swimmers, but nearly related to them are the\r\nbarnacles (Cirripedia) whose larvæ float about for a time near shore,\r\nand then settle down and attach themselves by their hinder parts to a\r\nrock or some other support, and begin to secrete an armature of limy\r\noverlapping plates that forms a strong cup in which they sit, often in\r\na crowd that whitens a big rock. When the tide is low these sessile\r\n\"acorn shells\" are tightly closed, but when the water returns, bringing\r\nits load of invisible food, the animal stands up, as it were, and\r\nthrusting out its feathery legs sweeps the water to capture a meal--a\r\nbeautiful sight to watch. The relation of the plates in the barnacle's\r\ncup to those in the coat of the higher Crustacea is more easily seen in\r\nthe more pelagic \"goose barnacle,\" whose hinder part is extended into a\r\ntough, flexible stalk, while the fore part is covered by plates. This\r\nkind is fond of attaching itself to floating timber, to ships' bottoms,\r\nor even to the surface of whales, and thus floats or is carried\r\nall over the watery globe. To it belongs the ridiculous myth of the\r\nbarnacle geese.\r\n\r\nGreat numbers of crustaceans of more advanced types live in the open\r\nsea, and at all depths; and many of them assume extraordinary shapes.\r\nThe space between tide marks, and the mud of salt marshes and tidal\r\ncreeks abound in a wide variety of species, some of which are familiar\r\nto everyone who lives at or visits the seashore. Thus the sand and rows\r\nof drifted seaweed on all our eastern beaches are likely to harbor\r\nflocks of amphipods, well called \"sea fleas\" or \"sand hoppers,\" which\r\nsometimes jump away before you in hundreds as you walk along.\r\n\r\nHere, too, are to be found the pretty, burrowing \"mole crabs,\" or\r\n\"ivory crabs,\" so called from their shining white jackets; and a host\r\nof other species with strange forms and habits haunt the margins of\r\ntropical and Oriental seas. All these are bandits, preying on whatever\r\nthey can catch, and between times guarding themselves from capture\r\nby fishes, bigger crabs, and other enemies, by lying in mud burrows,\r\nto the bottom of which they are quick to retreat. The big arm of the\r\nfiddler crab, held across its face, closes its burrow like a door. One\r\nsort, the hermit crab, has all its hinder parts naked, and so backs\r\ninto an empty snail shell, curling its taillike soft abdomen around the\r\ncentral column of the shell and so dragging it about with it, with its\r\narmored head and thorax sticking out of the mouth of the shell. As it\r\ngrows it becomes too large for its first shell, and from time to time\r\nmust leave it and find a larger tenement in which to ensconce itself--a\r\nperilous transfer. Let me quote some notes I made on a New England\r\nshore to give a picture of crustacean life there in summer.\r\n\r\n\"The lady crabs were plentiful, always alert, and inclined to be\r\npugnacious at our intrusion. The first one I met instantly rose upright\r\nat the surface of the water, and when I made an advance it sprang\r\nhalf way out of the water and cracked its pincer claws together as if\r\nsupposing it would reach, or at any rate frighten me. Perhaps it was my\r\nshadow it clutched at so viciously. If so, the crab probably concluded\r\nits huge antagonist to be an intangible ghost upon which the most\r\npowerful claws could have no effect, for an instant later it _backed\r\ndown_--literally and swiftly--to the bottom, and in a twinkling had\r\nwriggled tailwise into the mud and out of sight. When with my shovel\r\nI routed madame out of that retreat, she indignantly scuttled off\r\ntoo briskly to be followed, and will have great tales to tell of her\r\nadventure.\r\n\r\n\"The stone and fiddler crabs were as common and comical as usual;\r\nand I made the acquaintance of a new one called Gebia, which was a\r\nsmall, semi-transparent, bluish white, washed-out, bloodless specimen,\r\nshaped somewhat like a crawfish and carrying bunches of roe beneath\r\nits abdomen. It looked like a miniature lobster made of glass and\r\nfilled with milk. Then in the eelgrass there was a funny isopod, called\r\nCaprella. It was half an inch or so long, and clung by its hinder feet\r\nto the grass, waving its body up and down in search of minute prey.\r\nOther isopods and amphipods were exposed by turning over stones or\r\ndigging in the sand at the edge of the water--small, pale, shapeless\r\ncrustacea, which are flattened laterally so that they must lie on\r\ntheir sides, and when uncovered will kick about with feet and tail in\r\nlaughable anxiety to get under something. Under the stones we found\r\nthe tubes made by a certain species; and when we captured the active\r\nlittle architect and put him in a bucket of clean water, he instantly\r\nbegan to gather grains of sand and stone and to join them together Into\r\na shield under which he might hide. We found that these grains were\r\njoined together by spiderlike threads, which the amphipod spins from\r\ntwo pairs of small legs under the middle of his body, secreting a fluid\r\nthat hardens in the water. Another (Hippa) about the size and shape of\r\na robin's egg, but with a thin shell of mother-of-pearl (so to speak),\r\ngave us great amusement by its extraordinary celerity in burrowing, so\r\nthat we could hardly seize it before it had squirmed down out of reach\r\ninto the wet sand.\"\r\n\r\nThe edible crabs (Cancer) live in the shallow region just below ebb\r\ntide, for they cannot endure exposure to air as well as other species,\r\nand live by scavenging. The lobsters are inhabitants of still deeper\r\nwater, especially where it is somewhat rocky, and devour more carrion\r\nthan living fish. That miniature of the lobster, the fresh-water\r\ncrawfish, which is also edible, dwells in deep burrows in wet\r\nlands--burrows that are really wells half filled with water. Various\r\nspecies of these and other edible forms of Crustacea are found all over\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       MILLIPEDES AND CENTIPEDES\r\n\r\nThe myriapods (class Myriapoda) are those unpleasant creatures more\r\ncommonly known as centipedes, millipedes, or thousand-legged worms.\r\nThey have a wormlike form, with the body divided into segments, a\r\ndistinct head with antennæ, jaws and several single eyes, and a\r\nvarying number of air tubes, or tracheæ; two sexes exist, and eggs are\r\nlaid in the ground within cases formed by the mother of pellets of mud.\r\nThey vary in size from an almost invisible minuteness to a length in\r\nsome tropical species of six or more inches. The centipedes (Chilopoda)\r\nare those flattened forms so often seen in and about rotting wood and\r\nvegetation or in moist ground, their bodies looking like a chain of\r\nplates joined together by flexible skin, each section having a single\r\npair of legs, usually very short, but in one sort (Cermatia) each leg\r\nis longer than the body, and the hinder pair twice as long, matched by\r\ntwo very long feelers. Most of them are predacious, feeding on anything\r\nthey can catch, and their strong jaws exude poison. The larger ones may\r\ninflict a very painful bite if incautiously handled.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GIANT CENTIPEDE\r\n  (_Scolopendra gigas_)]\r\n\r\nAnother group, the Diploda, are known as galley worms, or millipedes,\r\nand have two pairs of bristlelike legs on each segment. Here the\r\nbody is as round as that of an earthworm, and is incased in a hard,\r\nchitinous shell, usually red-brown in color; and when disturbed they\r\ncoil up and emit an acrid, unpleasant odor as a defense.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        WEAVERS OF SILKEN TRAPS\r\n\r\nThe class Arachnida, which contains the scorpions, spiders, mites\r\nand their allies, connects the Crustacea with the Insects; and\r\nsome naturalists include within it the eurypterids and king crabs,\r\nclassified in this book with the Crustacea. All live on land and\r\nbreathe air except a small group of allies (Pycnogonida) which are\r\nmarine, and may be found on the rocks, and clinging to wharf piles,\r\netc., on our coasts as well as elsewhere; they appear to be all legs,\r\nand are known to New England fishermen as \"no-body crabs.\" The class\r\nincludes seven orders, the lowest in rank of which is that of the\r\nscorpions (Scorpionida).\r\n\r\nScorpions are inhabitants of warm countries, and some tropical American\r\nspecies are six inches in length, but those of our Southern States\r\nare smaller. They have slender bodies consisting of a cephalothorax\r\nand a long abdomen ending in a sharp sting through which two poison\r\nglands inject poison into the wound made by it, the effect of which\r\nmay be very severe on a man, and is fatal to the insects and other\r\nsmall creatures on which scorpions prey; this \"tail\" with the sting\r\nis usually carried curled up over the back. The body is protected by\r\nchitinous plates above and below. The legs are four. From the head\r\nspring two great, crablike, pincer claws. When these seize an insect\r\nthey hand it back to two small but powerful appendages at their base\r\nwhich act as jaws. Between them is a small mouth. Scorpions are\r\nnocturnal in habit, hiding by day in crevices, and wandering about at\r\nnight; thus they are likely to seek such dark retreats toward morning\r\nas a person's boots; and in hot, dry regions travelers must be cautious\r\nabout examining their clothing and baggage to avoid being stung. The\r\nscorpions retain their eggs until hatched. The young when born differ\r\nlittle except in size from their parents, and are cared for with much\r\nsolicitude by the mother, who carries them around with her for some\r\ntime, hanging by their pincers to her body. The race is ancient, fossil\r\nremains occurring as early, at least, as the Carboniferous age.\r\n\r\nThe second order, Pseudoscorpionida, includes the \"book scorpions,\"\r\na series of minute, stingless, scorpion-shaped creatures found in\r\nmoss, under the bark of trees, or more often on flies. A third order,\r\nPedipalpida, is that of the scorpion spiders, or \"whip scorpions\" of\r\nthe tropics; the fourth, Solpugida, contains certain ugly creatures\r\nintermediate between scorpions and spiders; and the fifth order,\r\nPhalangida, is that of the small-bodied, vastly long-legged things\r\ncalled \"harvestmen\" in England and daddy longlegs by us, which run\r\nabout in the summer heat, and feed on minute insects. They abound in\r\nall the warmer parts of the world, and in great variety, South America\r\nshowing some very bizarre forms. This brings us to the sixth order,\r\nAraneida--the spiders.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE SPIDERS AND THEIR WEBS\r\n\r\nSpiders are usually thought and spoken of as \"insects\" by the layman.\r\nMany persons call almost every creature an insect that is small and\r\nsupposed to be useless, or suspected of harmfulness. But spiders\r\nare different from insects properly so called in many important\r\nparticulars of structure and habits. Spiders have four pairs of legs,\r\nwhile insects have six legs. The spherical abdomen, which is cut off\r\nfrom the head by a deep constriction, shows no segmentation, and on its\r\nfloor are large glands (the arachnidium) producing the silk which is\r\nexuded from three pairs of tubes with sievelike openings, at the end\r\nof the abdomen, called the spinnerets. Their nervous system is highly\r\ndeveloped, and they show much intelligence. Spiders are of two sexes,\r\nbut the male is usually much smaller than his mate.\r\n\r\nWhen egg-laying time comes the female forms a little silken bed\r\nattached to grass, or underneath a stone, or stuck to some object,\r\nor placed in a burrow, or hung like a hammock by long guy lines, and\r\ndeposits in it eggs like drops of jelly. One sort places this under\r\nwater, forming a nest like an inverted cup and filling it with bubbles\r\nof air, and spending much of its time in this real diving bell. A\r\ncommon garden spider (Lycosa) forms globular cocoons, and drags them\r\naround attached to the spinnerets, regardless of jars and bumps. In\r\na large section of the tribe this is all the use that is made of the\r\nsilk, which differs from that of insects (caterpillars) in being made\r\nup of a great number of finer threads laid together while soft enough\r\nto unite into one.\r\n\r\nIt is a common habit with spiders to draw out a thread behind them as\r\nthey walk, and in this way they make the great quantities of threads\r\nthat sometimes cover a field of grass. This is the gossamer often so\r\nannoying to us in late summer, but a thing of beauty when glistening\r\nwith dew.\r\n\r\nThe gossamer of autumn, however, is made by the very small spiders of\r\nthe genus Erigones, which hide in the herbage, but in the fine weather\r\nthat comes after the first frosts climb to the tops of posts, fences\r\nand tall weeds, in company with the young of larger kinds, and \"turning\r\ntheir spinnerets upward allow threads to be drawn out by ascending\r\ncurrents of air, until sometimes the spiders are lifted off their feet\r\nand carried long distances.\" These are the \"ballooning spiders\" of\r\nwhich one hears. In this way the whole country is overspread with lines\r\nand tangles of trailing silken threads that whiten our clothes and\r\nstick to our faces.\r\n\r\nThree or four hundred species of spiders might be obtained in almost\r\nany locality in this country by diligent search, and thousands of\r\nforeign species are known; hence only a few conspicuous examples may be\r\nmentioned here. The tribe may be divided according to habits into two\r\ngroups of families: 1. The hunting spiders, which run on the ground or\r\non plants, catching insects by chase or by strategy; and 2. The cobweb\r\nspiders, which make webs to catch insects, and live all the time in the\r\nweb or in a nest near it.\r\n\r\nIn the former group are the Drassidæ, a family of small, varicolored\r\nspiders that run about on the ground or in bushes, one large genus of\r\nwhich (Clubiana) includes pale, or purely white species; their cocoons\r\nare baglike or tubular. The most conspicuous genus is Misumena, in\r\nwhich the species are white or brightly colored, and which spend their\r\ndays among flowers, waiting in rigid attitude for an insect to alight\r\nnear them on which they may pounce. Spiders can see well for four or\r\nfive inches, but not much beyond that. The Attidæ are small, hairy, or\r\nscaly jumping spiders, often brightly colored, that are found in open\r\nplaces and on the tops of low plants, whence they leap on their prey,\r\nor make long jumps to escape danger. To the next family, Lycosidæ,\r\nbelong the large spiders most often seen in fields and pastures. They\r\nare fond of dry, sandy places, where the females live in silk-lined\r\nholes. These lycosids are long-legged, rapid runners, and capture\r\ntheir game by running it down. To this family belongs the famous\r\ntarantula of southern Europe, fabled to produce a madness (tarantism)\r\nin a person bitten that could be cured only by dancing to music of a\r\ncertain lively measure called \"tarantella.\" (The so-called \"tarantula\"\r\nof our southwestern desert region, is, however, another species.) A\r\ncommon northern spider (_Lycosa carolinensis_) is its equal in size,\r\n(the longest legs covering a spread of three inches), and in color,\r\nblack with gray legs. Still larger is another North American lycosid\r\n(_Dolomedes tenebrosus_), gray with spiny legs ringed with dark and\r\nlight gray, which spreads four inches.\r\n\r\nThese big ugly creatures, and the bites of spiders generally, are\r\nregarded with unnecessary dread by most persons. The jaws (mandibles)\r\nare close together at the front of the head. They are two-jointed, the\r\nbasal joint stout, and the end joint or claw slender and sharp-pointed.\r\nThe claw has near its point a small hole, which is the outlet of\r\nthe poison gland. \"The poison kills or disables the insects which\r\nare captured by the spider. Its effect on the human skin varies in\r\ndifferent persons. Sometimes it has no effect at all; oftener it causes\r\nsome soreness and itching ... and cases have been known in which it\r\ncaused serious inflammation which lasted a long time. Spiders seldom\r\nbite and only in self-defense, the bites so commonly charged to them\r\nbeing often the work of other animals.\"\r\n\r\nIn the family Agalenidæ we meet with the first of the web makers. These\r\nare spiders of moderate size, characterized by a big head marked off\r\nfrom the thorax by converging grooves. Their natural home is in the\r\ngrass, where their flat, closely woven sheets of silk, almost invisible\r\nby reason of their transparency, but brought into plain view when\r\ncoated with dew or dust, are spread everywhere. They also are fond of\r\ngetting into cellars and old buildings, and constructing webs across\r\ncorners, bracketwise. Somewhere the web sinks like a narrow funnel into\r\na short tube in which the owner hides, watching hungrily until a fly\r\nalights on his silken platform.\r\n\r\n\"The Therididæ,\" says Emerton, \"are the builders of the loose and\r\napparently irregular webs in the upper corners of rooms, in fences\r\nand among rocks, and between the leaves and branches of low trees and\r\nbushes. They are generally small, soft and light-colored spiders, with\r\nthe abdomen large and round and the legs slender and usually without\r\nspines.... Most of the Therididæ live always in their webs, hanging by\r\ntheir feet, back downward. The webs have in some part a more closely\r\nwoven space under which the spider stands.\" These spiders are quick\r\nto avail themselves of any chance to spin their shapeless meshes of\r\nalmost invisible silk, which few regard as real \"webs,\" in closets,\r\ncellars, and all over the house or barn. Many of them are adorned with\r\ngay colors or striking patterns, and some are much feared, especially\r\n_Latrodectus mactans_, about half an inch long, which is black with\r\nscarlet spots. It is common from Canada to Chile, and everywhere is\r\nconsidered fatally poisonous--why, it is difficult to say.\r\n\r\nLast of our list, and highest in rank, are the Epeiridæ, the \"orb\r\nweavers,\" as they are often called, who make those regular spiral nets\r\nwhich are in our mind's eye when we think of cobwebs. Most of the\r\nmoderately large and handsome house and garden spiders are of this\r\nfamily, and everyone can easily examine their work, although it is less\r\neasy to watch them at it, as the webs are built and repaired at night.\r\nAmong the obscurer and foreign species the abdomen often shows humps,\r\npoints and long forward-reaching horns that make them exceedingly\r\ngrotesque, and doubtless difficult to handle by birds and other\r\ncreatures that seize them as food.\r\n\r\nOne of the round webs of the Epeiridæ consists of several radiating\r\nlines, varying in different species from a dozen to seventy, crossed\r\nby two spirals--an inner spiral that begins in the center and winds\r\noutward, and an outer spiral that begins at the edge of the web and\r\nwinds inward. The inner spiral is made of smooth thread, like that of\r\nthe rays, to which dust will not cling; the outer spiral is made of\r\nmore elastic thread which, when fresh, is covered with fine drops of\r\nsticky liquid.\r\n\r\n\"In beginning a web, after the radiating threads are finished, the\r\nspider fastens them more firmly at the center and corrects the\r\ndistances between them by [inserting] several short, irregular\r\nthreads, and then begins the inner spiral, with the turns at first\r\nclose together and then widening ... until they are as far apart as\r\nthe spider can reach with the spinnerets [resting] on one and the\r\nfront feet on the next, and so goes on nearly to the outside of the\r\nweb, where it stops abruptly. The spider usually rests a moment, and\r\nthen begins, sometimes at another part of the web, the outer sticky\r\nspiral.... As soon as the inner spiral is found in the way a part of it\r\nis cut out, and by the time the outer spiral is finished the inner is\r\nreduced to the small and close portion near the center.... The whole\r\nmaking of the web seems to be done entirely by feeling, and is done as\r\nwell in the dark as in daylight. When the spider is active and the food\r\nsupply good, a fresh web is made every day, the old one being torn down\r\nand thrown away.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AMERICAN GARDEN SPIDER\r\n  (_Epeira vulgaris_)]\r\n\r\nAs a rule these orb weavers do not stay in the web in the daytime, but\r\nhide away in their nests made in some near-by but concealed place; and\r\ntheir egg cocoons are hidden in all sorts of places.\r\n\r\nAll of the spiders that have been considered so far belong to the\r\ndivision of the class that has but a single pair of lungs. A second\r\ndivision has been made for those having two pairs of lungs, composed\r\nof a single family, the Mygalidæ, consisting of the so-called\r\n\"bird-catching\" spiders and the trapdoor spiders. The great mygale\r\nof Guiana has a body sometimes two inches long, and its legs will\r\nspan eight or nine inches of space. It is hairy all over, intensely\r\nblack, and a terror to all small creatures, even catching small birds,\r\naccording to tradition; but proof of this is wanting.\r\n\r\nThe trapdoor spiders are those of the genera Cteniza and Atypus which\r\ndig and inhabit vertical holes in the soil, lined with silk and closed\r\nat the top by a hinged stopper or \"trapdoor.\" Several species occur in\r\nsouthern Europe, one of which has a second door hanging by a silken\r\nhinge half way down the shaft; and in case of trouble the spider goes\r\nbelow it and pushes it above its head, so that the intruder is deceived\r\ninto thinking it has opened an empty nest. _Cteniza californica_ is the\r\ncommon species of our Southwest. The cover of the hole is made of dirt\r\nfastened together with threads, and is lined, like the tube, with silk,\r\nand fastened by a thick hinge of silk. The spider holds the door shut\r\nfrom inside. These underground homes are safe retreats for the spiders\r\nduring the day, and nesting places in which their eggs are deposited\r\nand young reared; at night the spiders go forth in search of prey.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            MITES AND TICKS\r\n\r\nMites and ticks are classified with the spiders as degenerate relatives\r\nof arachnoid stock. Ticks are large enough to be seen without a\r\nmagnifying glass, and some become half an inch long. Ticks are wholly\r\nparasitic. The female lays several thousand eggs at one time on the\r\nground or just beneath the surface. \"The young 'seed ticks' that hatch\r\nfrom these in a few days soon crawl up on some near-by blade of grass,\r\nor on a bush or shrub, and wait quietly until some animal comes along.\r\nIf the animal comes close enough they leave the grass or other support\r\nand cling to their new-found host.\" These parasites are the agents of\r\nthe spread of several infectious diseases of cattle, the worst of which\r\nis the destructive Texas fever, and of mankind, as spotted fever and\r\nother ills resulting from the presence of blood parasites.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n                 FROM BUTTERFLIES TO BEETLES AND BEES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe generally accepted classification of the insects divides them into\r\nmore than twenty orders, and these into hundreds of families whose\r\nspecies, already catalogued, are three times as numerous as all other\r\nknown animals together. \"There are, for example,\" as Lutz remarks,\r\n\"15,000 species of insects to be found within fifty miles of New York\r\nCity; more than 2,000 of these are either moths or butterflies.\"\r\n\r\nInsects as a class are characterized primarily by the division of the\r\nbody, when adult, into three clearly defined regions--the head, the\r\nthorax or fore body, and the abdomen or hind body. All insects have\r\nthree pairs of legs, distinguishing them from the eight-legged spiders,\r\nand from the many-footed myriapods and other arthropods, and most of\r\nthem have one or two pairs of wings, borne like the legs on the thorax,\r\nthe abdomen never bearing either. The head consists of four segments,\r\nbut in most cases the first three are consolidated into the hindmost,\r\nand are represented only by the appendages they bear. The foremost of\r\nthese are the mouth organs, of which there are three pairs: the most\r\nanterior are the mandibles, next the maxillæ, and then the labium,\r\nthe two latter bearing articulated prolongations known respectively\r\nas maxillar and labial palpi. The mouth has an upper lip (labrum) and\r\ncontains a tongue. These mouth parts are variously modified, and by\r\nthese modifications insects may be classified in two groups: \"First,\r\nthose in which the jaws and maxillæ are free, adapted for biting, as\r\nin the locust or grasshopper; and second, those in which the jaws and\r\nmaxillæ are more or less modified to suck up or lap up liquid food, as\r\nin the butterfly, bee, and bug.\" It is in this latter group that we\r\nfind those having those interesting relations with plants that result\r\nin cross-fertilization of flowers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A FLORIDA KATYDID\r\n  (_Cyrtophyllus floridensis_)]\r\n\r\nFrom the forehead spring a pair of antennæ, which are not only\r\n\"feelers,\" but the bearers of other senses. They are jointed, and\r\nexceedingly various in form and service. Some are mere stubs, others\r\nlong and slender as a whiplash, or they may be thickened at the end,\r\nas commonly in butterflies, or bear rows of hairs on each side, giving\r\nthem in some cases a beautiful plumelike appearance. With their\r\nantennæ insects inspect by touch whatever they come in contact with,\r\nand test the shape of what they may be constructing, such as cells\r\nfor their eggs. They recognize one another, and apparently exchange\r\ncommunications, or become aware of a stranger, and the ants induce\r\ntheir captive aphids to let down the honeydew by stroking them with\r\ntheir antennæ; but in many of these cases, if not all, additional\r\ninformation is derived through the antennæ by reason of the senses of\r\nhearing and of smell which many of them certainly possess. Ears, or\r\norgans sensitive to vibrations, and delicate hairs and other processes\r\nconnected with nerves responding to touch are found in various other\r\nparts of insects' bodies, but the feelers are preeminently the seat of\r\nthe sense of smell.\r\n\r\nThe eyes of insects are of two kinds, simple and compound. The simple\r\neyes are small and practically useless single ones (ocelli) situated\r\nin a triangle of three on the top of the head. The compound eyes are\r\non the side of the head, and are covered by a transparent layer of\r\nthe chitinous skin (cornea), divided by delicate lines into square\r\nareas (facets). Beneath each facet of the cornea is an \"ommatidium,\"\r\noptically separated from its neighbors by black pigment, and consisting\r\nof an outer segment or \"vitreous body\" and an inner segment or\r\n\"retinula\" formed of sensory cells. In some such eyes the ommatidia\r\nare few, but in others extremely numerous, so that the eyes cover a\r\nlarge space; some hawk moths are said to have 27,000 facets. The\r\nnature of the picture conveyed to the mind by such an eye has aroused\r\nmuch discussion. Photographs taken through the eye of a dragon fly show\r\nthat, though the eye is compounded of many lenses and sensitive areas\r\n(retinulæ) corresponding to them, yet the whole eye throws one image\r\non the retina. However complex such an eye may be, it is devoid of any\r\nfocusing arrangement and can only receive a clear image when the retina\r\nand the object are separated by the focal length of the lenses. Hence\r\nthe need for active movement on the part of creatures having them.\r\n\r\nThe head is connected with the thorax by a neck often protected by the\r\noverlapping front of the \"tergum,\" or chitinous plate that covers the\r\nthorax. The thorax consists of three segments, named from the front\r\nbackward \"prothorax,\" \"mesothorax,\" and \"metathorax.\" These and a few\r\nother technical terms are in such constant use in describing insects\r\nthat it is important to know them. The under (ventral) surface of the\r\nthorax is protected by another plate named \"sternum.\" The armor is not\r\ncontinuous all around the body as in the crustaceans, but that on the\r\nupper surface is connected with the sternum by a seam of soft skin\r\nalong the sides of the body.\r\n\r\nEach segment of the thorax bears a pair of legs, each of which consists\r\nof a stout, flattened \"coxa,\" nearest the body; a small second part,\r\nthe \"trochanter\"; a third, the \"femur\"; a fourth, the \"tibia\"; and\r\nfinally the \"tarsus,\" or foot, terminating in a pair of claws, bristly\r\non their under surface to give adhesive power. It is by means of these\r\nstiff hairs, and not by any suction or stickiness, that flies are able\r\nto walk on the ceiling and on vertical surfaces.\r\n\r\nThe wings of such insects as fly arise from the tergum of the thorax,\r\nand are in two pairs except in the flies, where there is but one,\r\nthe hinder pair being represented by two little protuberances called\r\n\"halteres.\" Usually the wings are strengthened by rods called \"veins,\"\r\nand the patterns of venation vary in different groups, and form one of\r\nthe means of classification.\r\n\r\nThe abdomen consists normally of ten segments, and contains most of the\r\ndigestive and all of the reproductive organs, above which runs the main\r\nblood vessel, and below it the highly organized nervous system, the\r\nchief ganglion of which, in the head, is termed \"brain.\"\r\n\r\nThe breathing of insects, although rhythmical in its inhalation and\r\nalternate exhalation, is not to the same purpose as ours. Respiration\r\ngoes on by means of a system of branching tubes (tracheæ) that ramify\r\nthroughout the body, and to which air is admitted through nine or more\r\nopenings in the side of the body guarded by valves called \"spiracles.\"\r\nThe buzzing of flies, \"singing\" of mosquitoes, and the like, are sounds\r\nmade in these spiracles, not by their rapid wings. At intervals the\r\ntracheæ are enormously enlarged to form air sacs. These no doubt,\r\nlighten the body, but they probably serve also to provide a reservoir\r\nof air from which the fine branches are filled by diffusion, and into\r\nwhich the carbon dioxide is discharged. The circulation of oxygen in\r\nadult insects, however, is never by means of the blood, but simply\r\nby absorption by the tissues into which the excessively attenuated\r\ntracheal tubes penetrate.\r\n\r\nInsects are bisexual, and male and female are always separate\r\nindividuals. Except in a few abnormal cases among the most lowly, eggs\r\nare produced and deposited in some favorable place for hatching.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SOME PRIMITIVE GROUPS\r\n\r\nInsects go back in geologic history to the middle of the Paleozoic\r\nage, and their remains are numerous and much differentiated in\r\nCarboniferous rocks, when the orders Aptera, Orthoptera, Neuroptera,\r\nand Hemiptera (the last represented in the Silurian by ancestral forms\r\nof the bedbug and the cockroach--the oldest fossils yet discovered)\r\nwere flourishing. The beetles and ants first appear in the Trias, the\r\ntrue flies, in the Jurassic, and the butterflies and moths, wasps, and\r\nbees not until the Tertiary. This indicates an evolutionary progress\r\nin structure with advancing time, as elsewhere in biology. The most\r\nprimitive type (Aptera) is still with us in the skipping silver fish\r\nand snow fleas, or spring-tails, that annoy us in various situations.\r\nThey are wingless, very simple in organization, and without any\r\nlarval metamorphosis. Not much better are the Mayflies, or dayflies\r\n(Ephemeridæ), that sometimes in early summer arise in enormous numbers\r\nfrom lake shores and rivers, and then quickly disappear. Most of them\r\nlive, in truth, only a single day (or night), a single one of the many\r\nAmerican species surviving three weeks. During their brief life the\r\nfemale drops into water several hundred eggs where they presently hatch\r\ninto swimming or crawling larvæ that next year, or perhaps not until\r\nthe third spring, creep out on land, molt, and fly abroad in ephemeral\r\ncrowds.\r\n\r\nIt is not a long step from these Mayflies to the dragon flies and\r\ndamsel flies (Odonata), which also belong to the water spaces of the\r\ncountry, and are among the most interesting of all the insect tribes,\r\nand the most beautiful, as they dart and curvet over the surface of\r\nsome glassy pool that reflects the steel-blue or peacock-green sheen\r\nof their long slender bodies, and the black bars that alone make their\r\nnarrow and almost transparent wings visible. They are known by many\r\nridiculous names, as \"darning needles,\" \"snake doctors,\" etc., but\r\nthere is no harm in them; on the contrary they are to be encouraged,\r\nfor they consume, especially in their larval stages in the water, a\r\nvast number of mosquitoes, gnats, and other troublesome \"bugs.\" The\r\nadults capture their food on the wing, and are hawklike in the agility\r\nwith which they turn and dodge in pursuit of their active prey. The\r\nactual catching is done with the feet, which curve far forward, and\r\nare studded with spines that give a sure grip on anything caught\r\nbetween them; they assist, too, in clinging to plants, but the legs\r\nare ill-adapted to walking. The wings are very powerful; are of a\r\nglassy texture, and never folded; they are crossed by a great many\r\nveins, breaking the surface into innumerable small squarish areas, and\r\nbear markings that distinguish each of the two or three hundred North\r\nAmerican species.\r\n\r\nDragon flies, and their cousins, the smaller and more graceful,\r\nlow-flying damsel flies, pair as a rule in flight. In some of the\r\nfamilies the female descends below the surface of the water, and is\r\nable by special apparatus to insert her eggs beneath the skin of a\r\nplant; others place them in plant stems above the water, or simply drop\r\nthem at the surface, whence they sink to the bottom. The \"nymphs,\" as\r\naquatic larvæ like this, with incomplete metamorphosis, are termed, go\r\nabout preying on anything they can seize and eat, and possess some very\r\npeculiar temporary adaptations to their underwater career. After a time\r\nthe nymph (which is the \"dragon\" in dragon fly) changes from a rather\r\nslender to a broad and flattened creature and crawls out of the water.\r\nSoon its skin splits, and an adult dragon fly emerges.\r\n\r\nClosely allied to the dragon flies are the stone flies, or alder flies\r\n(Percoptera), whose ugly and predacious nymphs are so well known\r\nto anglers as \"dobsons,\" \"crawlers,\" and by many other local and\r\nopprobrious names, because they make excellent bait for still-water\r\nfishing. The adult is that great, thin-winged creature called\r\n\"hellgrammite\" (_Corydalis cornuta_), with a wing spread of four\r\ninches, and possessed in the female of powerful biting jaws, which,\r\nas in all insects, work horizontally and not up and down as among\r\nvertebrates. In the male the jaws are extended into long, curved,\r\npiercing organs which cross when at rest, and which are fully an inch\r\nin length, but fortunately they are not used as jaws, but for holding.\r\n\r\nRelated to these is a group of well-known insects belonging to the\r\nold order Neuroptera, but now placed in separate orders, all with\r\nlacelike wings and an incomplete metamorphosis. They include the ant\r\nlions, the useful aphis lions, the scorpion flies (Panorpa), the lovely\r\nlace-winged flies, and the caddis flies, which make larval cases of\r\nbits of stick, or of shells or fragments of stone, in the bottoms of\r\nrapid streams. From somewhere in this group, probably, the ancestral\r\nLepidoptera branched off to develop into the butterflies and moths of\r\nthe present day. Next to them are the earwigs (Dermaptera), beetlelike\r\ninsects very conspicuous in Europe, but little noticed in this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            A MUSICAL TRIBE\r\n\r\nOut of this confusing array of rather primitive groups we come to an\r\nextensive and well-defined order, the types of which are familiar to\r\nthe most careless of observers in all parts of the world. This is the\r\norder Orthoptera, \"straight wings,\" which includes the cockroaches,\r\nmantids, walkingsticks, grasshoppers, locusts, katydids, crickets, and\r\ntheir humbler kinfolk.\r\n\r\nCockroaches are native to all the warmer parts of the world, and we\r\nhave a common large brown one, and some others of our own; but the pest\r\nof our kitchens is the small Oriental species whose origin was Asiatic,\r\nand which probably accompanied the earliest westward wanderings of\r\nmid-Asian men, and established themselves as boarders by the camp fires\r\nof the cave men. At any rate, the \"black beetles,\" as the British call\r\nthem--wrongly in both particulars--are now settled wherever ships have\r\ngone or civilized goods have been carried. As they first began to be\r\nreally troublesome in New York City about the time when the Croton\r\nwater was introduced (1842) they got the local name \"Croton bug,\" but\r\nthey are the world-wide _Blatta orientalis_, scampering around where\r\nthey are not wanted, carrying a queer packet of eggs under the tail.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TWO WALKINGSTICKS\r\n  (_Diapheromera femorata_)]\r\n\r\nThe mantids--of which a common species in the Southern States is known\r\nas \"mule killers\" because of the superstition that its saliva poisons\r\nstock--and the gaunt \"walkingstick\" insects that mimic twigs so well\r\nthat they are not seen as often as they might be, introduce us to the\r\ngreat tribe of grasshoppers or locusts--two words that it has worried\r\nbookmakers to keep straight. The grasshoppers fall into two families,\r\ndistinguished among other points by the length of the antennæ. The\r\nshort-horned ones (Acrididæ) are properly called locusts, and the\r\nlong-horned family (Tetigonidæ) are better known as grasshoppers,\r\ndespite the fact that until recently the books called this family\r\nLocustidæ. To the Acrididæ belong the locusts that in years past have\r\nworked such havoc now and then in the West, when vast swarms came from\r\nthe Rocky Mountains to the new farms along the eastern border of\r\nthe plains, and ate up the young grass and crops, leaving the ground\r\nlooking as if swept by fire. It is a story older than written history\r\nin all plains districts of southern Asia, Asia Minor, Egypt, and\r\nnorthern and south-central Africa, where no earthquake, or tornado,\r\nor other reaction of nature against man's interference with natural\r\nconditions, is so dreaded as a visitation of migratory locusts. In\r\nthis country any such \"plagues\" as half ruined Kansas forty years or\r\nso ago need no longer be anticipated, because the plowing on ranches\r\nand other disturbance of the ground in which the locusts lay their eggs\r\nis now so extensive, and the methods of checking small flocks are so\r\nwell understood, that the vast surplus generations that constituted a\r\nmigration in search of food in the old days are no longer born.\r\n\r\nAll the Orthoptera are musical, or at any rate noisy, and make their\r\nrattling or piercing notes as instrumentalists, not as vocalists.\r\n\r\n\"Some species,\" writes Frank E. Lutz, \"make a rasping sound by rubbing\r\ntheir hind legs against their front wings (tegmina). Others rattle,\r\nwhile flying, their hind wings against the tegmina. These sounds\r\nare primarily amorous serenades, and Nature's serenades without\r\nattentive ears would be even more curious than the ears for which the\r\ngrasshoppers perform. In this family there is an auditory organ on each\r\nside of the first abdominal segment, just above and back of the place\r\nwhere the large hind femora start. Notice the clear round spot on the\r\nnext grasshopper you catch.... Few have not heard the masculine debates\r\nas to whether Katy did or didn't, but many do not know by sight the\r\nsmall, green, long-horned, stockily built disputants, both of whom\r\nusually stay high in trees. The musical apparatus of the male--the\r\nmusician--is at the tegmina, and the leaflike wing covers, broadly\r\ncurving entirely around the body, act as sounding boards. The female's\r\nwing covers do not have the thick rasp veins at their bases.\"\r\n\r\nA third family, the Gryllidæ, contains the crickets--burrowing mole\r\ncrickets, ordinary black crickets dwelling in the herbage, and several\r\nkinds of tree crickets that look like ghosts of their kind. All add to\r\nthe noise of a summer evening by rubbing the roughened surface of their\r\nwing covers together--chirping to ears that are situated in the shins\r\nof the listening cricketesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE TRUE BUGS\r\n\r\nSkipping the white ants or termites, which are few and comparatively\r\nharmless in this country, but in the tropics make vast trouble for\r\nhouse-holders; the various sorts of lice and the little black thrips\r\nthat destroys onions and some fruits, we come to the great assemblage\r\nthat entomologists call \"bugs,\" limiting the word to the order\r\nHemiptera, which now must be considered.\r\n\r\nThe two features, basally common to all the immensely diverse members\r\nof the order, are the character of: 1. The feeding organs; and 2. The\r\nwings--in each case very distinct from that of all other insects. The\r\nbugs have highly developed piercing and sucking jaws. The mandibles and\r\nfirst maxillæ are transformed into stylets, often barbed toward the\r\ntip; these work to and fro within the groove of a stout-jointed beak\r\n(rostrum) which is formed by the union of the second maxillæ. The head\r\nis usually triangular in shape, as viewed from above.\r\n\r\nAs to the second characteristic, the bugs are distinguished by the\r\nmodification of the fore wings into partly horny covers for the\r\nentirely membranous hinder wings. This feature divides the order into\r\ntwo suborders, Homoptera and Heteroptera. In the first this hardening\r\nis little evident; but in the Heteroptera--where not wingless, as in\r\ncertain families--the fore wings are stiff and lie flat on the back\r\nwhen closed, whereas in the Homoptera they are somewhat humped over the\r\nback, and droop down on each side a little. The triangular space marked\r\non the back by the closed wings is a ready mark by which to recognize a\r\nhemipteran, or true bug.\r\n\r\nThe Hemiptera display a greater diversity of form than any other order\r\nof insects, and vary in size from almost microscopic scales to fat\r\ncicadas and \"giant\" water bugs. \"Some pass their lives in the upper\r\nparts of trees, others chiefly on the lower limbs; still others prefer\r\nthe protection of roots, stones or rubbish on the ground; a large\r\nnumber of species select a home beneath the surface of the earth,\r\noften in the holes of ants or other insects; a conspicuous assemblage\r\nof dull-colored forms occurs only in the crevices or under the bark\r\nof trees and shrubs; while a host of others skim over the surface of\r\nplacid waters, and a few are found remote from land upon the rarely\r\ndisturbed waves of the tropical and subtropical oceans.... While the\r\ngreater number derive their food either from the sap of vegetables,\r\nor the blood of fishes, animals and man, there are others which are\r\nsatisfied with the strong fluid that accumulates beneath damp, decaying\r\nbark of trees, or still others which enjoy the juices of fungi or\r\nferns.... Those which creep about in search of living prey are often\r\nfurnished with curved or hooked forelegs, suitable for seizing and\r\nholding creatures when in motion, such as caterpillars and other larvæ.\"\r\n\r\nThe Homoptera include the immense and destructive family Coccidæ,\r\nthe bark lice, scale insects, and mealy bugs, among which, however,\r\nare the useful producers of lacs and such dyes as cochineal. Related\r\nto them are the Aleyrodidæ, the destructive \"white flies,\" and the\r\nAphidæ, almost infinite in number and in harmfulness to fruit trees and\r\ncultivated plants; also the queerly shaped leaf hoppers and similar\r\nminute, plant-sucking forms.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the curiosities of zoölogy that associated with these\r\nminutiæ we find a family of bugs of large size--the cicadas, whose loud\r\n\"singing\" by the male in autumn gives them the name \"locust,\" and often\r\nbecomes annoying when one wants to sleep where trees are near by. The\r\nnoise is made by vibrating membranes stretched over a pair of sound\r\nchambers, situated, one on each side, near the base of the abdomen.\r\nThe cicada lays its eggs in slits cut in the bark. The newly hatched\r\nyoung drops to the ground and, burrowing into it, feeds by sucking the\r\njuices of roots. The time spent in the ground varies according to the\r\nspecies in various parts of the world. In the case of our \"periodical\"\r\ncicada it lasts about seventeen years, whence we call that species\r\n\"seventeen-year locust,\" and know it, when a great swarm comes out of\r\nthe ground and ascends the trees, by the humming of the crowd which\r\nsounds like the vibration of telegraph wires in the poles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEVENTEEN-YEAR LOCUSTS\r\n  1-4, pupæ, increasing in age; 5-15, the locust imago struggling out\r\n  of the pupa; 16, 17, 18, the imago stretching its wings; 19, empty\r\n  pupacase; 20, 21, perfect locust. (Smithsonian Institution.)]\r\n\r\nThe Heteroptera, or proper \"bugs,\" are a much larger assemblage, a few\r\nkinds of which have attracted popular notice. The long catalogue\r\nbegins with the small \"water boatmen\" that live an active predatory\r\nlife on the bottom of streams and ponds. Other common aquatic families\r\nare the Notonectidæ, that swim on their backs, the Nepidæ, or \"water\r\nscorpions,\" one of whose genera is that of the slender, long-legged\r\n\"skaters\" that glide so swiftly across the glassy surface of still\r\nwaters. Then there are the great water bugs (Belostoma), which all\r\nover the world are the tigers of quiet rivers and ponds, pouncing from\r\ntheir concealed lairs on even minnows, small frogs, and anything else\r\nthey can catch and kill. These great brown bandits are sometimes two\r\ninches long. Some of the tropical species are strange in form and have\r\nextraordinary habits in caring for eggs and young.\r\n\r\nLeaving the aquatic group, we come to certain troublesome plant-sucking\r\nbugs, and to the bedbug, which claims the longest lineage of any known\r\ninsect, for the remains of perfectly recognizable ancestors are found\r\nin Ordovician rocks dating from early in the Paleozoic time. Skipping\r\nthe lace bugs, red bugs, or \"cotton stainers,\" and others, we come to\r\na series of families that are among the worst pests of the farmer and\r\ngardener, the chinch bug, squash bug, cabbage bug and many others, the\r\naggregate effect of whose ravages causes a loss of millions of dollars'\r\nworth of crops every year, not only in this country, but everywhere\r\nthat grain, vegetables, and fruit are cultivated; and in most cases it\r\nis not the native but introduced species that does the most damage.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  GILDED BUTTERFLIES AND DUSTY MOTHS\r\n\r\nThe butterflies and moths, whose beauty attracts more collectors than\r\nany other group of insects, constitute the order Lepidoptera, the\r\nmeaning of which term is \"scaly winged,\" in reference to the fact that\r\nthe hairs that clothe and ornament the wings are scalelike. Butterflies\r\nhave club-shaped antennæ, and belong to the division Rhopalocera.\r\nMoths are Heterocera. Some of the moths, especially the males, have\r\nfeathered antennæ, some threadlike, while a few tropical ones have\r\n\"club\" antennæ, so that this distinction is not perfect. The pupæ\r\nof butterflies are not protected by cocoons, as are those of most\r\nmoths, and are usually called \"chrysalides\" (singular, \"chrysalis\").\r\nButterflies in general only fly during the daylight, when few moths are\r\nstirring, and usually hold their wings erect when at rest, while moths\r\nhold them flat or folded against the body.\r\n\r\nThe Lepidoptera undergo a complete larval metamorphosis, and the\r\nprocess is more familiar to general readers than in the case of\r\nother insects. From the eggs, which are often objects of great\r\nbeauty when examined through a lens, are hatched wormlike creatures\r\nthat grow rapidly by repeated moltings of the skin into full-sized\r\n\"caterpillars\"; those of certain moths develop in community nests,\r\nbut ordinarily they live singly. All have three pairs of thoracic\r\nlegs, and a variable number of temporary \"prolegs\" near the rear\r\nof the body. Caterpillars may be smooth, round, and colorless, or\r\ncoated with a heavy fur, or bristling with knobs, tufts of hairs, and\r\nother appendages, and brightly ornamented with color; and many of\r\nthese peculiarities appear to be wholly defensive in purpose. Some\r\ncaterpillars give off, when alarmed, disgusting and acrid fluids, and\r\nthe hairs of others irritate venomously the skin of anyone handling\r\nthem, and probably account for the fact that few birds will touch\r\ncertain species. All caterpillars feed voraciously--in fact, this is\r\nthe only time in the life of many species when food is taken, the adult\r\nmoths and butterflies as a rule being neither willing nor able to eat.\r\nAt a certain time, having completed its final molt, the caterpillar\r\narranges itself according to the custom of its race, and subsides into\r\na pupa.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CATERPILLAR OF THE MILKWEED BUTTERFLY\r\n  (_Anosia plexippus._) (Smithsonian Institution.)]\r\n\r\nA century ago men interested in butterflies spoke of themselves\r\nas aurelians, explaining that \"aurelia\" was a proper name for the\r\nbutterfly pupa because of the golden ornaments it usually bore. Really,\r\nhowever, this characteristic, so marked in the gilt \"buttons\" of our\r\ncommon milkweed butterfly, pertained to only a single family--the\r\nNymphalidæ. When the nymphalid caterpillar reaches the turning point,\r\nit withdraws the abdomen a little from the cracking skin, exudes a\r\nlittle sticky silk which it fastens to its support, then hooks the tip\r\nof its abdomen firmly into this silk; this done, hanging thus by its\r\ntail, the caterpillar finally shakes off its coat and, as a chrysalis\r\n(a Greek word of the same general sense as the Latin _aurelia_) the\r\npupa hangs, head down and inert, until the following spring.\r\n\r\nThe butterflies of greatest size and most splendid coloring belong to\r\nthe family Nymphalidæ, whose hundreds of species are scattered all over\r\nthe warmer parts of the world. Here belong those gorgeous tropical\r\nones, whose wings, sometimes with a spread of five inches, emulate the\r\nprismatic hues of the \"eyes\" in a peacock's tail, and which are so\r\noften seen mounted as lovely ornaments in curiosity shops; and here\r\nalso is classified that strange \"leaf butterfly\" of Malaysia, whose\r\nwings when closed so perfectly imitate a leaf of the tree on which it\r\nalights that the sharpest eyes can hardly find it. Here, too, belong\r\nour brown-streaked \"fritillaries,\" such as the vanessas, and darker\r\nones like our mourning cloak, and many others well known to amateurs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FINAL MOLTING OF A NYMPHALID CATERPILLAR\r\n  (a) Before shedding skin. (b) In act of shedding skin. (c) Trying to\r\n  catch hold of silk button. (Smithsonian Institution.)]\r\n\r\nAll of this family have their chrysalides hung by the tail; but in\r\nthe remainder of the butterfly families they are held in an upright\r\nposition by a loop of silk that passes around them like a girdle. Such\r\nare the \"coppers,\" the \"blues,\" the \"hair streaks\" and many other\r\nsmall, gayly colored species (Lycænidæ) common in summer, to which\r\nseason they add so beautiful an interest. In another large family, the\r\nPapilionidæ, are found the great yellow and black \"swallowtails,\" which\r\nare almost exclusively American, and several dark blue or purple-marked\r\nspecies, with \"tails\" to their wings, that attract the attention of the\r\nmost careless as they lazily flit among the flowers. In this family,\r\ntoo, are the sulphur-yellow butterflies that dance over the roads and\r\nfields in little flocks; and, alas, the white ones whose caterpillars\r\nare so injurious to cabbages and similar vegetables. The last family\r\n(Hesperidæ) contains small, rather obscurely marked, butterflies that\r\nconnect the Rhopalocera with the Heterocera, or moths.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CATERPILLAR BEGINNING ITS COCOON\r\n  Photo, A. N. Mirzaoff]\r\n\r\nIn fact the distinction between the two divisions of Lepidoptera is\r\none of convenience rather than of science, for it marks difference of\r\nhabits rather than of structure. Instead of a naked pupa, that of the\r\nmoth is inclosed in some sort of envelope called a \"cocoon.\" This may\r\nbe an earthen cell underground, or a woolly tuft fastened to some such\r\nsupport as the bark of a tree, or a leaf rolled and tied by silken\r\nthreads into a tube, or a burrow in dead wood, or a paperlike case\r\nfastened to a twig; but in every case some special provision is made\r\nfor the easy emergence of the imago when the time comes for its birth\r\nas a moth. The moths themselves do no harm. Their few weeks of life\r\nare devoted entirely to mating and putting their eggs in just those\r\nplaces where the larvæ they will never see can have the food proper for\r\nthem and the best chance for life--a matter of marvelous instincts and\r\nadaptations. Few of them, except the hawk moths, eat at all. That is\r\ndone in the caterpillar stage, when many sorts become destructive of\r\nthe labor and hopes of the farmer and gardener and orchardist, or make\r\nhavoc in stores of grain and meal, and in garments of wool and fur,\r\ncarpets, and cabinets of natural history specimens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOTH AND EGGS\r\n  Photo, A. N. Mirzaoff]\r\n\r\nMost of the moths are small, inconspicuous, grayish or brownish\r\ncreatures whose markings, very lovely when closely examined, so closely\r\nresemble in their mottlings the places where the moths rest during the\r\nday, that they are comparatively safe from the birds, monkeys and other\r\nenemies that seek to catch and eat them. Some, however, are of large\r\nsize and brighter hue. Thus the silkworm moths of the Orient (and of\r\nour own land) may measure four or five inches across the outstretched\r\nwings, as does the cecropia and others that flit about evening lights;\r\nand a near relative among us is the exquisite, long-tailed, luna moth,\r\nwhich is pale green with chestnut edgings; many others in this group\r\nare almost as \"richy bedight\" as butterflies. It is these that make the\r\nlarge papery cocoons so easily seen in the fall in trees and bushes.\r\n\r\nA remarkable family (Bombycidæ) is that of the hawk moths, which much\r\nresemble in shape and action humming birds. They are day flyers,\r\nbut most active in the morning and evening twilights, and hover on\r\nwhirring wings before a flower, while with their long, tubular tongues\r\nthey suck its nectar, for these moths feed as well as do their fat,\r\nuprearing, bulldoglike caterpillars, to which they owe another common\r\nname for the family--that of sphinx moths. Their pupæ are lodged under,\r\non, or near the ground in a loose cocoon, and are to be recognized\r\nby an appendage, curled around like a jug handle, in which lies the\r\nchrysalis' long tongue.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  FLIES AND THEIR HYGIENIC IMPORTANCE\r\n\r\nFlies, scientifically speaking, are only those insects of the order\r\nof Diptera, distinguished by having only one pair of fully developed\r\nwings. They pass through a complete metamorphosis, and the larva is in\r\nall cases a \"grub\" or \"maggot\" destitute of legs. It is rarely enclosed\r\nin a cocoon but lies buried in the ground, floats in the water, or is\r\nprotected by the last larval skin which, separating from the pupa skin,\r\nremains around it as a hard case. Flies and their larvæ live in the\r\nmost diverse manner. Some flies attack backboned animals and suck their\r\nblood, some prey on smaller insects, some suck honey, and some find\r\ntheir food in decaying animal and vegetable matter. A large number of\r\ndipterous larvæ eat refuse, many feed inside growing vegetable tissues,\r\nand some prey, or are parasitic, on other insects. More than 10,000\r\nspecies of true flies have already been named in the United States\r\nalone. The order contains all the different species and varieties of\r\nfleas, mosquitoes, sand flies, gnats, midges and gall flies. Then come\r\nthe blood-sucking gadflies, and half a dozen families allied to them;\r\nthe scavenging syrphus flies, the bots that trouble cattle, the house\r\nflies and stable flies of deservedly bad repute; and, lastly, the\r\nhorseflies, bee parasites, and botflies. The popular interest in these\r\ninsects is confined to the flies of our houses and stables, and to the\r\nmosquitoes. In fact it is in the relation that the flies mentioned,\r\nand some others, bear to public health and comfort, that this group of\r\ninsects is important at all to any but the special student.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        BEETLES AND THEIR GRUBS\r\n\r\nThe beetles (order Coleoptera) make up a very distinct and natural\r\ngroup of insects, characterized by the horny or leathery texture of\r\ntheir forewings, or \"elytra,\" which serve as cases for the folding\r\nmembranous hind wings alone used in flight. These elytra, when closed,\r\nusually cover the whole hind body. They are strengthened with ridges\r\naround their edges, and marked with a series of longitudinal furrows\r\nand often also with impressed dots. The hind wings are sometimes very\r\nsmall or wanting; in such cases the elytra are often fused together\r\nalong their middle edges (suture). The head is usually extended from\r\nbehind forward, having therefore a large crown and a small face; the\r\nfeelers are very inconstant in form; the mandibles are always developed\r\nas strong biting jaws; the prothorax is free and movable; its tergite\r\n(pronotum) is a very prominent feature in all beetles, reaching back to\r\nthe origin of the elytra.\r\n\r\nThe beetles undergo a complete metamorphosis, and the larvæ, called\r\n\"grubs,\" have various shapes, while the pupa is \"free,\" that is,\r\nclosely similar in development and appearance to the adult. Beetles\r\nare world-wide in distribution and more than 100,000 species have been\r\ncatalogued. They are divided into a great number of families, among\r\nwhich those mentioned below contain the most noteworthy forms.\r\n\r\nThe tiger beetles are large-headed, predacious forms, most numerous\r\nin the tropics, which live in holes in the soil and rush out to seize\r\npassing prey. The ground beetles (Carabidæ) are a very extensive\r\nfamily, represented in all parts of the world, and are insect hunters,\r\ndestroying hosts of injurious insects. Most of them are black or brown.\r\nThe Dyticidæ and Hydrophilidæ are aquatic families, including some\r\nof the largest and fiercest of carnivorous beetles, the terrors of\r\nponds and marshes, where they prey not only on other insects and their\r\nyoung, but on tadpoles, small fishes, etc.; and their grubs are quite\r\nas savage. The rove beetles (Staphylinidæ) are a very large family of\r\nnarrow, elongated species, which are very active; they feed mostly on\r\nsmall insects, worms and snails. The carrion beetles belong to the\r\nfamily Silphidæ, the smaller among which live in moss and under tree\r\nbark, and the larger genera contain the noted \"burying beetles.\" Some\r\ngroups of very minute, ground-keeping species lead to the familiar\r\n\"ladybirds\" (Coccinellidæ), a large and world-wide family of small,\r\nrounded beetles, usually brightly spotted, which frequent plants of all\r\nsorts, and feed chiefly on aphids. Some quaint superstitions pertain\r\nto these pretty insects, that should be attracted rather than repelled\r\nwhen they visit window gardens and greenhouses, which they will\r\nendeavor to clear of the \"greenfly\" and similar injurious plant lice.\r\nPassing over several inconspicuous families we come to the dermestids,\r\nvery small, dark-colored beetles of elliptical outline, some of whose\r\ngenera are among the worst of household pests, and have been spread by\r\ncommerce throughout the civilized world.\r\n\r\nSome of the dermestids are troublesome as museum pests; others attack\r\nfood in the pantry, store, or warehouse. \"Drugs do not escape their\r\nattack, species devouring even cantharides and tobacco; woolen and silk\r\ngoods, feathers and furs, are ruined if left long exposed to their\r\ndepredations; and one species is accused of biting young doves....\r\n_Anthrenus scrophulariæ_, probably introduced into America from Europe,\r\nhas received the names carpet beetle and buffalo bug, on account\r\nof its habit, both as larvæ and imago, of destroying carpets. This\r\nbeetle measures about four-fifths of an inch in length, and is black,\r\nbrick-red and white, the last crossing the back in two zigzag lines.\r\nThe point of attack is the nailed-down edge or the lines of the seams.\"\r\n\r\nWho has not been amused at the labors of the big black beetles that\r\none meets in summer on dusty paths rolling balls of fibrous material.\r\nThese \"dung beetles\" are the American cousin of the scarab of the\r\nancient Egyptians, which typified to them many mystical ideas connected\r\nwith life, present and eternal. With its shovellike head and broad\r\nforelegs the beetle gathers and compacts the material it wants, and\r\nbegins to roll it, sometimes with the help, more often against the\r\nstruggles, of another beetle toward a prepared nest-hole. Arrived there\r\nan egg may be inserted into it, and then the rounded mass is left as\r\nfood for the grub to be hatched from the egg; if no egg is inserted,\r\nthe ball becomes simply a mass of stored food to be eaten by its\r\nmaker. Processes vary among the 7,000 or more known species of this\r\ncosmopolitan family.\r\n\r\nNot all of this great family are dung beetles, however, or scarablike.\r\nHere belong the May bugs and June beetles that come blundering around\r\nlighted country residences in the evenings; and it is their fat white\r\ngrubs that, hatched from eggs buried in the ground, devour the roots\r\nof the grass and other plants, spoiling the lawns and strawberry beds.\r\nThe robin is their most effective enemy. Among the lesser genera are\r\nthose of the rose bugs, hated pests of the horticulturist and fruit\r\ngrower. In that section of the family known as the cetonians are found\r\nthe giants of the race, the West African \"goliaths,\" four inches long;\r\nthe tropical American Hercules beetle, exceeding six inches long, half\r\nof which belongs to the forward-reaching horn of its helmet, the South\r\nAmerican elephant beetle which is even more bulky, and several other\r\ngiants, the males of which have the head ornamented with fearsome\r\nprotuberances.\r\n\r\nOther families of beetles are the Buprestidæ, whose larvæ are injurious\r\nto trees by boring into their wood; the Elateridæ, or snap beetles,\r\nwhich arch their bodies and leap when they happen to fall on their\r\nbacks, and among which are found the many varieties of brilliant\r\n\"fireflies\" for which the American tropics are famous. The larvæ of\r\nthe elaters mostly live in decaying wood, and are the justly hated\r\n\"wireworms\" of our gardens. Then there are the Meloidæ, that include\r\nthe blister beetles, or oil beetles, one of which is the cantharides of\r\nthe pharmacopoeia; and there are a great many more.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    HONEY MAKERS AND PLANT STINGERS\r\n\r\nA long shelf is required in the naturalist's library for the books\r\nrelating to the Hymenoptera of America alone--our wasps, bees, ants,\r\nand their smaller relatives, which engage everybody's attention by\r\ntheir social habits and amazing display of instincts. Besides these\r\nthree principal and familiar groups the Hymenoptera include a host of\r\nother insects of great but inconspicuous importance. In large part\r\nthese are parasitic on other insects or their larvæ, or even on their\r\neggs, and some are the most minute insects known, virtually invisible\r\nto the unaided eye. Scarcely larger are the makers (Cynipidæ) of the\r\ngalls so commonly seen on trees and plants in which they breed. Another\r\ngroup (Chalcidoidea) cause the swellings that disfigure plants by\r\nplacing their young within their tissues, such as the \"joint worms\"\r\nthat ruin grain; and here, again, many species are parasitic on grubs.\r\nThen there are the sawflies (Tenthredinidæ), resembling bees, whose\r\novipositors are like a pair of saws with which these insects are able\r\nto bore holes into wood, within which the egg is placed and the young\r\nlarva burrows; of these are many and various kinds, all injurious to\r\ntrees, garden shrubs and plants, each kind restricted to a particular\r\nsort of plant.\r\n\r\nPerhaps even more numerous are the ichneumon flies, whose service in\r\nthe world seems to be to keep the insect hosts down to the number\r\npossible to exist and at the same time to allow men and other animals\r\nto live. Their method of life is to deposit their eggs on or in the\r\nbodies of other insects, usually in the larval stage, where they\r\nhatch and thrive by the slow death of the host. The ichneumon flies\r\nare the dread of all other insects, most of whose adaptations for\r\nself-preservation are directed against this insidious and universal\r\nenemy to insect life.\r\n\r\nNone of the foregoing Hymenoptera live in colonies or by social\r\nmethods. That plan belongs to the four most advanced divisions--wasps,\r\nbees, termites, and ants. Even among the wasps and bees, however, the\r\nlarger number of species live alone or in single families, each female\r\nconstructing a solitary receptacle for her purpose underground, in\r\nsoft wood or otherwise. Most species store with the egg placed there\r\nhalf-dead insects, or pollen, etc., as food for the grub, which\r\nreceives no further attention; but a few, such as the big digger wasp\r\n(Bembex) take food to the grubs daily. Another class of both wasps and\r\nbees form nests of several cells containing eggs, and thus in spring\r\nfamilies are originated by fertilized females that have survived the\r\nwinter. As the larvæ develop in succession they are fed by the mother,\r\nand presently mature sufficiently to aid her in caring for the younger\r\ngrubs. Out of such family nests, or \"combs\" of paper cells, often\r\nattached to the ceilings of sheds and porches of rural houses, have\r\napparently developed the mutually helpful societies of bees and ants,\r\nwhich are often of surprising extent and permanency.\r\n\r\nThe prosperity of these social insect communities, whose instincts,\r\nhabits, and products amaze us, is due to an organized division of\r\nlabor in the community between three classes of \"citizens\"--(1) the\r\ncomparatively few males, whose whole duty is to fertilize the queen\r\nmother and supply the community with progeny; (2) the selected and\r\nspecially nourished \"queen\"; (3) a vast number of nonreproductive\r\nfemales, the \"workers,\" that build and guard the nest, gather and\r\npreserve stores of food (honey), and nurse and rear the young. In\r\nsome groups the duties of the workers are subdivided among classes\r\nthat differ in size and equipment. It is these female workers, or\r\ntheir correlatives among the solitary bees and wasps, that sting,\r\ntheir useless ovipositors having been transformed by the addition of\r\npoison into deadly weapons by which they procure their prey, or defend\r\nthemselves, or both. It is this division of labor, and attendant\r\nhabits, that especially characterize the higher Hymenoptera, and give\r\nto the order the supreme rank it occupies among insects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n                 AT THE DOORWAY OF THE \"UPPER CLASSES\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                  PRIME SIGNIFICANCE OF THE NOTOCHORD\r\n\r\nWe have been considering up to this point one of the two primary and\r\nnatural divisions of the animal kingdom--that into Invertebrates and\r\nVertebrates. Although these are terms made familiar by long usage, and\r\nrefer to the absence or presence of a backbone composed of jointed\r\nsections (vertebræ), a truer conception of the distinction is had by\r\nregarding the first as animals whose skeleton, or frame, that gives\r\nsupport to the muscles and other soft parts of the body, is exterior;\r\nand the second as animals whose skeleton is interior. The one is, in\r\nscientific language, an \"exoskeleton,\" or more or less hardened outer\r\nshell from the inner surface of which the organs grow and maintain\r\ntheir attachment and leverage for work or protection; and the other an\r\n\"endoskeleton,\" around which the organs and integument are accumulated\r\nby growth, and by means of which the animal's strength is maintained,\r\nthe interior bones--of which the chief is the spinal column, or\r\nbackbone--giving a firm fulcrum for the operation of the muscles and a\r\nsupport and protection for the vital organs.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAll the vertebrates are included in a single phylum--Chordata. This\r\nterm has supplanted in zoölogy the old term Vertebrata (now reserved\r\nas a class name only), because it is more comprehensive and precise.\r\nProfessor Harmer says:\r\n\r\n\"The axis of the backbone of all vertebrates is formed by an elastic\r\nrod known as the 'notochord,' which lasts throughout life in some of\r\nthe lowest forms, but in the higher forms appears only in the embryo.\r\nThe universal occurrence of this structure has been regarded as the\r\nmost important characteristic of the Vertebrata and their allies, which\r\nare accordingly grouped together in the phylum Chordata. The members\r\nof this phylum are further distinguished from other animals by several\r\nimportant features. Of these one of the most important appears to be\r\nthe existence of lateral outgrowths of the pharynx, which unite with\r\nthe skin of the neck and form a series of perforations leading to the\r\nexterior. These structures are the gill slits, and in the fishes their\r\nwalls give rise to vascular folds or gills. With the assumption of a\r\nterrestrial life the higher vertebrates lost their gills as functional\r\norgans, respiration being then performed by entirely different organs,\r\nthe lungs. But even in these cases, the gill slits appear in the\r\nembryo.... Another fundamental characteristic of the Chordata is given\r\nby the central nervous system, which lies entirely above the alimentary\r\ncanal, just dorsal to the notochord. Not only does this position of the\r\nnerve centers distinguish the Chordata from the Invertebrates, but a\r\nfurther point of difference is found in the development.\"\r\n\r\nThis definition requires the inclusion of various creatures very unlike\r\n\"vertebrates,\" and the phylum therefore embraces three subdivisions:\r\n1. Adelochorda--marine wormlike creatures having a notochord in\r\nthe anterior of the body, and gill slits, both persistent; 2.\r\nUrochorda--the ascidians or tunicates, small marine creatures, some\r\nfixed along shores, others free-swimming and in some cases united into\r\nswimming colonies (e. g., the salpæ), the tadpolelike larvæ of which\r\nshow a notochord in the tail; and 3. Vertebrata.\r\n\r\nThis last great subphylum is divisible into seven grand natural groups\r\nwith the rank of classes, namely:\r\n\r\n    1. _Acrania_--Lancelets (Amphioxus).\r\n    2. _Cyclostomata_--Lampreys; hags.\r\n    3. _Pisces_--Fishes.\r\n    4. _Amphibia_--Amphibians.\r\n    5. _Reptilia_--Reptiles.\r\n    6. _Aves_--Birds.\r\n    7. _Mammalia_--Mammals.\r\n\r\nThe first of these seven classes, the Acrania, has usually, heretofore,\r\nbeen set apart as a subdivision equal in rank to the subphyla\r\nAdelochorda and Urochorda, and the remaining six classes were grouped\r\ninto a coordinate subphylum Craniata, denoting that they alone have\r\na distinct head (cranium); the reason was that its members, the\r\nlancelets, have no spine, but only a notochord, which, however, extends\r\nfrom end to end of the body above the digestive organs, and persists\r\nin the adult and throughout life. The lancelets (amphioxus) are small,\r\nfish-shaped creatures that burrow in the sand of the seashore, usually\r\nleaving only the head exposed, and sucking in a continuous current\r\nof water which brings with it minute food. They breathe through gill\r\nslits. The reproduction is bisexual, and by eggs.\r\n\r\nThe significance of the Acrania in this phylum is that they represent\r\na very early ancestral stage of the stock from which the higher\r\nvertebrates (Craniata) have developed, and from which they themselves,\r\nof course, have also diverged to a certain degree; and it is because\r\nthey retain many primitive characteristics that the study of their life\r\nhistories has engaged the attention of so many eminent zoölogists and\r\nhas thrown so much light on the evolutionary history of the \"higher\r\nanimals,\" or vertebrates.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  THE ROUNDMOUTHS--LAMPREYS AND HAGS\r\n\r\nPopularly included among fishes, the lampreys and hags of the class\r\nCyclostomata (roundmouths) differ from true fishes by the possession of\r\na suctorial mouth devoid of functional jaws, by the single olfactory\r\norgan, and by the absence of lateral appendages, or paired fins.\r\nThey have an eellike form and method of travel, and some species are\r\na yard in length. They are bisexual, discharging both eggs and milt\r\ninto the water to become fertilized by accidental contact. Lampreys\r\nascend the rivers to spawn, however, and there make little heaps of\r\npebbles, carried and piled with the mouth, in which the eggs find some\r\nprotection from the many egg-eaters in all streams. Most, if not all,\r\nof the migratory parents die after spawning. From the eggs hatch larvæ\r\nthat undergo a metamorphosis. Lampreys live on small crustaceans,\r\nworms, and so forth, eat carrion, and also attack living fishes. The\r\ntongue, like the interior of the mouth, is armed with teeth. They\r\nare in the habit of attaching themselves to stones in order to hold\r\nthemselves against a river current, breathing meanwhile by taking water\r\ndirectly into the pouchlike gill chambers and expelling it, instead of\r\nsucking it through the mouth and passing it out of the gill slits. In\r\nancient Rome the big sea lampreys of the Mediterranean were eaten as a\r\ndelicacy, and even cultivated in landlocked ponds, and they are still\r\nhighly prized in some parts of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe hags are an even more primitive group of cyclostomes that live in\r\nthe mud of shallow seas and are too abundant on both our coasts, where\r\nthey are a pest of the fisheries. Their general habits are similar\r\nto those of lampreys, but wherever possible they attach themselves\r\nto fish on which they feed. The hag is particularly destructive to\r\nfishes caught on \"set lines\" of hooks, or in nets, and the loss thus\r\nresulting on the coasts of California, in Japan, and in some European\r\nfisheries is very serious. As these cyclostomes have no scales or\r\nother hard parts to be preserved except a few teeth, no fossil remains\r\nare certainly known, but it is the opinion of paleontologists that\r\notherwise the class might be traced to the earliest Paleozoic time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n                 FISHES--THE ARISTOCRACY OF THE WATERS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn beginning, with the fishes, an account of the typical vertebrates,\r\nit will be well to point out the structural features in which all\r\nagree. Vertebrates are bilaterally symmetrical animals, with an\r\ninternal skeleton, the axis of which is composed of similar segments\r\n(vertebræ) and divides the body into a dorsal and a ventral portion.\r\nThis skeleton is first formed in cartilage, and remains so, or it\r\nmay become more or less hardened by deposits of lime, or completely\r\ntransformed into bone. The anterior end of the vertebral column\r\n(backbone) carries a capsule (the skull) inclosing the brain. When\r\nlimbs are present there are never more than two pairs. The nervous\r\nsystem consists of a brain and spinal cord from which trunk nerves\r\narise and ramify throughout the body. The blood is first driven to the\r\ngills, or to the lungs, as the case may be, by means of a heart having\r\neither one or two auricles, and after it has traversed the body through\r\narteries and veins it returns to the heart. The stomach, liver, and\r\nother viscera, lie in the ventral part of the body. The skin produces\r\na protective covering characteristic in each division of the class, as\r\nscales for fishes, feathers for birds, and so forth.\r\n\r\nFishes are vertebrates fitted to live in water. Their typically\r\nfusiform shape is that best adapted to progress through the rather\r\ndense medium they inhabit; and their limbs are swimming organs, or\r\n\"fins.\" These are of two kinds, \"paired\" and \"median.\" The former are\r\nthe pectorals, one on each side of the forward part of the body, and\r\nthe pelvic, or ventral fins on the belly and near together; these four\r\nserve, like the bilge keels of a ship, to maintain stability--prevent\r\nrolling over--rather than for progression. The median fin is vertical,\r\nand extends around the tail from the middle of the back to the end,\r\nwhen it is complete; but in most cases it is represented by an upright\r\nfin, the \"dorsal\" on the back, by the \"caudal\" fin fringing the tail,\r\nand by the \"anal\" fin at the vent. The powerful caudal fin is the\r\nprincipal agent in swimming, aided by undulatory movements of the\r\ndorsal and ventral fins; and it has a twisting action that drives the\r\nanimal forward as does the rolling of the oar in \"sculling\" a boat.\r\nThe median fins are developed from the skin, and are supported by a\r\nskeleton system of their own, not connected with the spine. In most\r\nfishes the upper and lower halves of the caudal fin are alike, and the\r\ntail is symmetrical, but in sharks and some others the end of the spine\r\ncurves upward and the lower wing of the tail is much larger than the\r\nupper; in the former case the caudal fin is said to be \"homocercal,\"\r\nand in the latter \"heterocercal.\"\r\n\r\nThe fins of fishes are in many species modified and adapted to purposes\r\nremote from swimming or balancing. Thus it is the first dorsal fin of\r\nthe remora that has become the sucker on its crown; in the angler the\r\nfirst rays of the back fin are lengthened and lobed to form its \"lure,\"\r\nand elongation of various fin rays as feelers, or light bearers, etc.,\r\nmay be found elsewhere. The pectorals are enormously enlarged to make\r\nwings for the flying fish and the gurnard, and to give a substitute for\r\nlegs to the Oriental gobies that like to go ashore, while the ventrals\r\nare transformed in certain fishes of swift streams into organs by which\r\nthey can fasten themselves to the bottom or climb against a cataract.\r\n\r\nThe skin of fishes is rather thick and tough, and abounds in glands\r\nthat secrete mucus, and in cells that secrete the hardening, or\r\nprotective, denticles and scales that form the coat of most species,\r\nand which differ widely.\r\n\r\nLouis Agassiz distinguished four kinds of scales--placoid, ganoid,\r\ncycloid and ctenoid. The first named occur only in the selachians\r\n(sharks and rays) and are variously shaped particles of lime that\r\nprick through the skin, which makes excellent polishing material when\r\nprepared as \"shagreen.\" These \"denticles\" in the skin become teeth in\r\nthe mouth without change of structure, and the great spurs with which\r\nthe \"saw\" of the sawfish is armed are only extreme instances of this\r\nspecial adaptation.\r\n\r\nGanoid scales are such as formed the armor of the great extinct tribe\r\nof ganoid fishes, a remnant of which survives in our gar pikes, or\r\nbillfish. In some of the fossils they are roundish, and overlap, but\r\nin modern ganoids they are rhombic in shape and plate the body edge\r\nto edge, connected by toothlike processes that articulate with the\r\nadjacent scales, and permit flexibility in the body. The outer face of\r\nthe scales is enameled, like teeth, beneath which is a layer of bone\r\nsubstance and the teeth in the mouth are only modified scales.\r\n\r\nCycloid and ctenoid scales are those of ordinary fishes, and are\r\nprecisely alike, except that the hinder, or attached, end of the latter\r\nis split into a comblike fringe. They have a rounded or often polygonal\r\nform, are composed of lime, and are translucent, thin, elastic, and\r\noverlap like shingles on a roof. The scales of fishes increase in size\r\nwith the animal's growth by additions to the exposed rim, and as these\r\naccessions may be observed, by counting them the age of the fish may be\r\ncomputed, when checked by certain other considerations.\r\n\r\nThe colors of fishes are produced by pigment cells, both in the skin\r\nand on the outside of the scales; and by a peculiar tissue composed of\r\nsecretion products called \"iridocytes.\" These, by their various ways\r\nof reflecting light, and by the color elements contained in them, give\r\nrise to the different hues of fishes.\r\n\r\nFish show their inferiority as a class by retaining the method\r\nof respiration by means of gills characteristic of the aquatic\r\ninvertebrates. The gills are composed of bright red tassels set on\r\nhoops that encircle the throat, and are usually covered by a movable\r\nflap--the \"gill cover.\" Under this flap, the neck of the fish is\r\nperforated by crescentic slits. The fish normally breathes by taking\r\ngulps of water into the mouth and throat, and squeezing it out through\r\nthe gill slits; during its rhythmical passage over the thin gills the\r\noxygen of the dissolved air is absorbed by the hæmoglobin of the red\r\nblood, and is carried away to incessantly revivify the body; and at the\r\nsame time carbon dioxide is set free and got rid of in the outgoing\r\nstream.\r\n\r\nAn organ peculiar to fishes is the air bladder--a sac lying under the\r\nbackbone and communicating by a duct with the stomach. It is not only\r\nof service in respect to buoyancy, but is accessory to respiration. In\r\nspite of its name, however, it does not contain air, but a gas rich\r\nin oxygen and nitrogen which is secreted by certain arteries and is\r\ncarried away when needed by other blood vessels, as fat and starchy\r\nsubstances are stored elsewhere and may be drawn upon when food falls\r\nshort. Nevertheless, the chief function of the \"swim bladder,\" which is\r\nexceedingly varied in shape, is to render the fish of the same weight\r\nas the water in which it lives. In this condition of equilibrium the\r\nfish swims with a minimum of muscular effort. A consequence of the\r\norganization, however, is to restrict the vertical range of each fish\r\nand kind of fish, because any considerable movement up or down means a\r\nchange of pressure. This will bring about the expansion or contraction\r\nof the volume of gas in the air bladder and thus alter the specific\r\ngravity of the animal. Such automatic adjustment is limited, however,\r\nand practically prevents a fish rising or falling far above or below\r\nthe depth to which it was born; and the fatal effects of violent change\r\nare seen in those fishes brought up in explorers' dredges from great\r\ndepths, the air bladders of which are invariably so distended as to\r\nkill the animal. Nevertheless, some species seem able to migrate from\r\nand to great depths; and temperature is perhaps a greater factor in\r\nvertical distribution than the air bladder, the adjustments of which\r\nmust be slow. The great body of fish life in the sea resides within\r\nabout 300 fathoms of the surface.\r\n\r\nFishes have a brain and a system of nerves and sense organs varying\r\naccording to rank, and outlining the higher developments of the nervous\r\nsystem as found in mammals. Of the sense organs the most peculiar are\r\nthe small sensitive bodies scattered in various parts of the skin,\r\nfins and mouth, called \"end buds,\" each at the terminus of a nerve\r\nfibril. These buds seem to carry the sense of feeling, and are said\r\nto be represented in mammals by the taste buds in our tongues. They\r\nare aggregated in a narrow band along the side of the fish, and in a\r\nmaze on the side of the head, called the \"lateral line,\" the course\r\nof which is plainly visible on many fishes, as for example, on the\r\nsunfish of brooks and ponds. This lateral line consists of canals in\r\nthe skin, opening to the surface by pores, and reached by branches\r\nof large nerves. The use of the lateral line to the fish is not well\r\nknown, but it is believed that its cells are of service in balancing\r\nthe body. As blind fishes are able to avoid obstacles with the greatest\r\nease when swimming, it is possible, in the opinion of Dr. Bridge, that\r\nthese organs enable their possessors to appreciate undulatory movements\r\nin the water in the shape of reflex waves from contiguous surfaces or\r\nobjects.\r\n\r\nOne feature of the lateral line on the head are the \"auditory organs,\"\r\nvarying with the kinds of fish, which contain semicircular canals, with\r\notoliths, in the more or less complete form of an internal ear. Each is\r\nreached by the auditory nerve from the brain and is also connected with\r\nthe air bladder in many cases. Whether this is a true organ of hearing\r\nin the ordinary sense, or whether it serves some other purpose, as, for\r\ninstance, the regulation of the distension of the air bladder, is not\r\nknown. The old question of whether fishes hear sounds made above the\r\nwater is not yet answered scientifically; but it is probable that they\r\ncan feel the jar of sounds made in the water, which is equivalent to\r\nhearing, as far as it goes. Fishermen have a saying that if you swear\r\nyou won't catch any fish--a good precept, anyhow; but more effective is\r\nthe care anglers take not to step heavily, nor to make loud, jarring\r\nnoises, near the bank of the stream in which they mean to cast their\r\nlines.\r\n\r\nThe great majority of fishes have good eyesight, and the eyes\r\nthemselves are similar in structure to those of the higher land\r\nanimals; but it seems probable that the range of vision is short.\r\nThe eyeballs are usually large in proportion to the size of the\r\nhead--sometimes strikingly so--and are movable; while the situation\r\nin the head is naturally such as to give the most advantageous vision\r\naccording to the habit of life. Thus those of sharks, and other\r\npredatory sorts that live by the chase, are well forward; while those\r\nof bottom-feeders, and especially rays, flatfish, anglers and the like,\r\nare in the top of the head, looking upward. Nocturnal species have the\r\nlargest eyes, but the unfortunate cave fishes, whose whole life is,\r\nand has been for unnumbered generations, passed in the total darkness\r\nof caverns and underground streams, have lost the use of their eyes\r\naltogether, and the organs themselves have disappeared by atrophy.\r\n\r\nBlindness is found also in oceanic families that dwell far below the\r\npenetration of daylight; yet many fish of the Stygian depths, which, so\r\nfar as we know, never leave that region of utter blackness, possess big\r\nand apparently efficient eyes. Most of the blind or nearly blind sea\r\nfishes thus far obtained have been in hauls from a depth of about 1,200\r\nfathoms. It is believed that the ability to see in deep-sea fishes is\r\nconnected with the light-giving (phosphorescent) organs possessed by\r\nmany of them, and with the fact that animals of all sorts on the sea\r\nbottom in deep water are luminous, and so reveal themselves to the\r\npredatory creatures that feed on them, while the fishes' own \"lanterns\"\r\nenable them to chase moving prey, avoid enemies, and find mates.\r\n\r\nFishes have efficient olfactory organs situated near the snout, and in\r\nthe higher families they are in pairs and become true, but internal,\r\nnostrils. The sense of smell is strong, and perhaps more useful on\r\nthe whole than the sense of sight, especially among the carnivorous\r\nspecies. Sharks seem to follow their prey by scent like hounds.\r\n\r\nAll these senses serve instincts related to the necessities of the\r\nindividual and the race in each kind of fish. This is sometimes\r\nmanifested in what appears to us as cunning means of safety or of\r\nprovision for young; but discriminative intelligence is small in\r\nfishes, which probably are able to learn little more than that at\r\ncertain places and times food may be had, as is illustrated in\r\ncultivated fish ponds, where the captives from infancy onward are fed\r\nregularly. Anglers tell of old trout that refuse year after year to\r\nbe beguiled by their experiments in flies; but it is doubtful whether\r\nthis is anything more than an increased wariness due to frequent\r\ndisturbance. The remora is, or has been, used by the Caribs of the\r\nWest Indies and the negroes of Zanzibar for catching sea turtles, a\r\nline being fastened to a captive and comparatively tame remora carried\r\nin the boat, and the fish turned loose as soon as a turtle is seen\r\nat the surface. The remora will make a bee line for the turtle and\r\nattach itself firmly to the shell so tenaciously that both animals\r\nmay be dragged to the boat. It is to be noted that the fishermen\r\nsee the turtle near by before they dispatch their living grapple,\r\nand it is doubtful whether the remora has any notion of what it is\r\ndoing. It simply obeys repeatedly an instinct. This very low degree of\r\nintelligence is doubtless owing to the almost invariable environment of\r\npiscine lives, in which virtually nothing occurs to suggest any change\r\nin traditional habits or arouse into activity any rudiments of mind a\r\nfish may possess. Mental inertness is characteristic of aquatic animals\r\nof all kinds, as contrasted with the correlated activity of body and\r\nmind of land animals stimulated by varied and changeable surroundings.\r\n\r\nThe breeding habits of fishes furnish one of the most interesting\r\nchapters in their natural history, and many surprising facts have been\r\nlearned within a few years in regard to the reproduction of marine\r\nspecies, of great value to the sea fisheries.\r\n\r\nIn all fishes the sexes are separate. As a rule females are larger than\r\nmales, and more numerous. The size of the egg in any group depends on\r\nthe amount of food yolk stored for the sustenance of the young, which\r\nmust thrive by its absorption until it is able to eat by its mouth. The\r\nlargest are the eggs of sharks, etc. (Elasmobranchii), which resemble\r\nfowls' eggs. The European dogfish, perhaps two feet long, has eggs an\r\ninch in length, each in a flattened leathery \"purse\" having tendrils at\r\nthe ends that twine about weeds and anchor it like a rocking cradle.\r\nThe similar egg capsules of skates, dropped on the sand, are common\r\nobjects on all beaches. Elasmobranch eggs are deposited at intervals\r\nthroughout the year and, as they are exposed to comparatively little\r\ndanger, are few in number. In most other orders spawning, as the egg\r\nlaying of fishes (and aquatic amphibians) is termed, is limited to a\r\nshort period, the eggs are small, and the number of eggs produced is\r\noften enormous--five or six millions in a large cod, for example.\r\n\r\nIn the majority of Teleostomi--a group name embracing all the modern\r\nbony fishes--the eggs are voided broadcast into the water, the males\r\nat the same time emitting clouds of milt. These eggs are of two kinds,\r\none that sinks and, often being glutinous, sticks to some object on or\r\nnear the bottom, and is called \"demersal\"; and another that contains an\r\noil bubble, making it so buoyant that it floats, and these latter are\r\ncalled \"pelagic.\" The fertilization of such spawn must be accidental,\r\nbut as the milt and the eggs sink or drift together the number that\r\ncome into fertilizing contact is no doubt considerable. Nevertheless,\r\nan extremely small percentage ever reach the point of hatching, and\r\nstill fewer survive to become mature, for in addition to unfavorable\r\ncircumstances of water and temperature, every living thing, almost, in\r\nthe ocean, including the parent fish themselves, is a devourer of the\r\neggs and young of fish; and it has been said that the vast number of\r\neggs dispensed by certain species, only a single pair of which on the\r\naverage survives to maturity, is one of nature's methods of providing\r\nfood for the inferior forms of marine life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n                     SHARKS--THE TIGERS OF THE SEA\r\n\r\n\r\nOnly a rapid systematic sketch of the class Pisces, fishes, is\r\npossible, distinguishing the main divisions, alluding to their history,\r\nand touching here and there the most characteristic genera and species\r\nof the thousands that have been described by ichthyologists. The\r\nprimary division is into three subclasses:\r\n\r\n   1. _Elasmobranchii_--Sharks, skates, rays, etc., having a\r\n   cartilaginous skeleton.\r\n   2. _Teleostomi_--Ordinary fishes, having a bony skeleton.\r\n   3. _Dipnoi_--Lepidosiren, and many extinct, primitive families.\r\n\r\nIn the Elasmobranchii, or selachians, the skeleton consists of\r\ncartilage, as in the embryos of all fishes--a sign of their primitive\r\nand inferior rank; but parts of it in various species become hardened\r\nby depositions of lime, especially in the vertebræ, in spines and\r\nteeth, parts often well preserved as fossils. Sharks' teeth are among\r\nthe best known of fossils, and before science established their\r\ntrue character were commonly called \"birds' tongues,\" or \"snakes'\r\ntongues.\" The sharks, first to be considered, are a very ancient race,\r\noriginating in early Paleozoic times. Of the many curious extinct forms\r\nthat terrorized the Silurian, Devonian, and Carboniferous seas, a few\r\nrepresentatives still exist in the South Pacific, notably the cow\r\nsharks; an eellike Japanese species with frilled gills that Dr. Garman\r\nthought might easily fill the rôle of \"sea serpent\"; and the quaint\r\nbullhead, or Port Jackson sharks of Australian waters; all these are of\r\nsmall size and the last named represents the principal race in Mesozoic\r\nseas. Their flat teeth form a sort of pavement of the mouth, enabling\r\nthem to crush the mollusks and crabs on which they chiefly feed.\r\n\r\nNext in a rising order of classification, and of somewhat more recent\r\norigin geologically, is the European family of dogfishes (Scyllidæ),\r\nwhich includes also the \"ground sharks\" of warm seas--deep-water fish\r\neight to twelve feet long, that creep about near the bottom in search\r\nof prey. Next come the large pelagic sharks of the family Carchariidæ,\r\nwhich contains about sixty species, scattered over all the seas,\r\nand one confined in the fresh water of Lake Nicaragua. One section,\r\nthat of the \"topes\" and \"hounds\" of temperate and warm seas, are\r\nbottom-feeders, and have pavementlike teeth adapted to crushing and\r\ngrinding the shellfish on which they subsist; but most of the family\r\nare swift and powerful hunters of fishes in the open sea, such as the\r\ndreaded tiger shark of the West Indies, which is variegated in color\r\nand sometimes twenty feet long, and the equally big blue, white, dusky,\r\nand other ferocious bandits ranging not only the tropical seas, but\r\nmore common in northern oceans than is generally supposed. The teeth in\r\nthese and other hunting, fish-catching sharks, are shaped somewhat like\r\narrowheads, in some cases smooth-edged and single-pointed, in others\r\nwith sharply notched edges and side cusps. They are set in the flesh of\r\nthe jaw, unattached to the underlying bones, in concentric rows, one\r\nclose behind the other, all round the front of the mouth, both above\r\nand below, and look and act like a set of saws, a sidewise movement of\r\nthe jaws sawing through an object seized in a single bite. As fast as\r\nthe front row of teeth are lost they are replaced by those of the row\r\nimmediately in the rear. But all gradations exist between these and the\r\nmosaic of \"pavement\" teeth in the topes. The mouth of these hunting\r\nsharks is on the underside of the head, and they must turn on their\r\nbacks to seize anything floating or swimming near the surface.\r\n\r\nThis is the group that furnishes the \"man-eater\" stories--tales\r\nthat have been substantiated by so many terrifying examples that\r\nno precaution of safety against them should neglected, even on our\r\nnorthern coasts, where the ravenous blue shark, or the dusky species,\r\nmay appear at any time, even in harbors. A few years ago a man was\r\nseized by one of these sharks in a little inlet of New York Bay, at\r\nFreeport, New Jersey.\r\n\r\nBlue sharks are nocturnal in habit, and are sometimes seen asleep\r\nor resting in the daytime, with the tips of the two dorsal fins,\r\ncharacteristic of this family, in sight above the surface of the\r\nwater. \"So gentle are they in their movements,\" says one authority,\r\n\"that, unlike many other monsters of the deep, they do not disturb\r\nthe luminous creatures, which at the same time will be lighting every\r\nwavelet with their phosphorescence. Blue sharks are not very particular\r\nas to what fish they take as food, though those which are gregarious in\r\ntheir habits, like mackerel, pilchards, and herring, are most commonly\r\nhunted by them.\" A curious relative of these \"man-eaters\" is the\r\nhammerhead, in which the sides of the head are extended in two great\r\nlobes, with eyes at their extremities; this kind of shark is greatly\r\nfeared in the East Indian seas. In spite of it, and the prevalence of\r\nother huge and voracious sharks, the Arabs about the entrance to the\r\nRed Sea, and the natives of other Oriental shores, will swim and dive\r\nin the open sea, apparently without fear, where Europeans would be\r\ndevoured almost instantly. Another peculiar shark is the thresher, well\r\nknown in the North Atlantic as elsewhere for its strategic maneuvers.\r\nIt grows to a length of fifteen feet, of which the tail forms at least\r\none half. Quite inoffensive to man, the thresher feeds on the shoals\r\nof smaller teleosts, such as pilchards, herrings, and sprats. When\r\nfeeding it swims in gradually diminishing circles around the shoal,\r\nsplashing the water with its long tail, and keeping the victims so\r\ncrowded together that they become an easy prey. Hammerheads and their\r\nrelatives, the \"bonnet\" sharks, frequently visit both our shores in\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\nThe porbeagles are big, fierce sharks of the family Lamniidæ, the\r\ngiant of which is Rondelet's shark, known to attain a length of more\r\nthan forty feet. The triangular, saw-edged teeth of such a one measure\r\nnearly an inch across the base; but similar fossil teeth, and also\r\nothers dredged from the bottom of the South Pacific, are much larger,\r\nindicating sharks beside which Rondelet's would be small, and in all\r\nprobability these monsters survived to a comparatively recent date. A\r\nremarkable lamnoid shark of Japanese deep waters has the snout produced\r\ninto a long, flat, flexible, leaflike blade.\r\n\r\nClosely related sharks, almost as big, are well known in the North\r\nAtlantic. Two of them, the \"bone\" and the \"basking\" sharks, are killed\r\nby fishermen whenever encountered for the sake of the oil in their\r\nlivers. The name of the second refers to its habit of loafing and\r\nsleeping on the surface on fine days, when a boat may go so near it\r\nthat a harpoon may be planted in its hide before it will move. The real\r\n\"basking shark,\" however, is a gigantic species of Rhinodon, of the\r\nIndian and South Pacific oceans, with a very bulky body that may exceed\r\nforty-five feet in length. Both of these ponderous fishes are sluggish,\r\nand are not dangerous to man, except that a blow of the tail may smash\r\na boat when an attempt is made to harpoon them at close quarters. They\r\nfeed on small fishes that go in shoals, and also, perhaps, on seaweeds.\r\n\r\nThe last sharks to be mentioned are American dogfish of the family\r\nSqualidæ (another family, Scyllidæ, are known as \"dogfish\" and \"hounds\"\r\nin Great Britain), which are numerous and greatly hated along both our\r\nnorthern coasts. The common gray dogfish of the North Atlantic and\r\nCalifornia coasts is the spiny one (_Squalus acanthias_), the larger\r\nfemales of which will weigh about eight pounds. It makes its home in\r\ndeep water off the New England coast, approaching the shore when the\r\nmackerel come in and disappearing when they depart; but dogfish are\r\nto be found all summer in shoal places such as George's Bank, and\r\nirregularly in shore inlets. In the late autumn they become numerous\r\non the Grand Banks, and stay there until the winter's cold drives them\r\naway into deeper water. Everywhere these small sharks are a nuisance\r\nto the fishermen, by tearing nets and by eating the cod, etc., hooked\r\non the trawl lines. Formerly they were regularly hunted for the oil in\r\ntheir livers, which is especially valuable for certain purposes, as in\r\nharness making, but the price of this oil is now low, and the fishery\r\nhas declined.\r\n\r\nThe economic use of sharks is not great except as producers of oil.\r\nThe flesh is good food, but not popular. In China sharks' fins are a\r\nfavorite substance for delicate soups and sauces, and a very large\r\ntrade in catching sharks for their fins is carried on near Bombay, and\r\nin East Indian waters.\r\n\r\nThe ugly angel shark, with its squat, toadlike body, big, winglike side\r\nfins and thick tail, occupies an intermediate place between the sharks\r\nand the rays. It creeps along the bottom, and is remarkably voracious.\r\nThe chimæra is another queer \"monster\" of the deep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n                 THE FEARFUL DEVILFISH AND OTHER RAYS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rays (order Raiæ) differ from the sharks superficially rather than\r\nin structure, where the most important difference is the position of\r\nthe gill clefts, which are lateral in the sharks and ventral in the\r\nrays and skates, as the smaller members of the order are called. The\r\nmajority of them have a flattened, depressed body, from which the\r\nbroad, expanded pectoral fins are scarcely distinct, while the tail is\r\nusually long and slender, in one family so much so that they are known\r\nas \"whip rays;\" and in some a horny point at the tip is connected with\r\na venom gland so that its pricking is poisonous, and these are called\r\n\"sting rays.\" All the rays are carnivorous, but only the sharklike\r\nforms (sawfishes and the Rhinobatidæ) actively pursue their prey. The\r\ntrue rays live on the bottom and feed on shellfish and small fishes.\r\nMost of them bring forth a few young alive, but many lay eggs in\r\nsquarish, oblong, leathery cases with tendrils at the corners by which\r\nthey become moored to eelgrass, etc; they are frequently cast up on\r\nbeaches, and go by the name of \"sea purses,\" In the earlier stages the\r\nyoung ray is much like a shark, and the enormous development of the\r\npectoral fins does not occur until nearly the time of hatching.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CATERPILLAR PROTECTED BY FORM AND COLOR RESEMBLING THE\r\n  TWIGS OF A TREE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEA HORSE PROTECTED BY FORM AND COLOR RESEMBLING THE\r\n  MARINE PLANTS AMONG WHICH IT LIVES]\r\n\r\nThe sawfishes, of which several tropical species are known, besides\r\none common in the Atlantic and Mediterranean, are among the most\r\nremarkable of oceanic fishes. The body is slender, sharklike, and of\r\ngreat power. The head is flattened, and the snout projects into a hard,\r\nflat, sword-shaped beak, the edges of which are thickly studded with\r\nsharp teeth; and this singular weapon places all the large inhabitants\r\nof the ocean at the mercy of this powerful marauder--it is the worst\r\nenemy of whales, even, in the warmer seas, as is the \"killer\" in the\r\nArctic region. With it the sawfish cuts and slashes, tearing off pieces\r\nof flesh, or ripping open the abdomen of its opponent, then seizing the\r\ndetached pieces. One can easily picture to himself the slaughter when\r\na sawfish dashes into a school of fishes, squids, or porpoises, and\r\nslashes right and left with his ripsaw of a beak. Some of the Oriental\r\nspecies reach, and even exceed, twenty feet in length, and Dr. Day, the\r\nIndian ichthyologist, says that such monsters have been known to cut\r\nbathers completely in two. The saw of a twenty-foot fish would measure\r\nsix feet in length and a foot across the base.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GILA MONSTER, FEARED THOUGH ITS BITE IS NOT ALWAYS\r\n  DEADLY TO MAN\r\n  Photo, Elwin R. Sanborn, N. Y. Zoological Society]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE IGUANA, A REMARKABLE LIZARD OF THE NEW WORLD\r\n  Photo, Ewing Galloway]\r\n\r\nThe most famous of the rays, probably, are the torpedos, a family with\r\na rounded, instead of the customary triangular outline, and a rather\r\nshort tail, species of which occur on all tropical and temperate\r\ncoasts, and are noted for their power to give electric shocks to any\r\nliving thing touching them.\r\n\r\nThe electric organs are a pair of large masses lying between the head\r\nand the pectoral fins. These are derived mainly from four nerves, which\r\noriginate from an electric lobe of the medulla oblongata. By means of\r\nthe electric shocks which they are able to administer at will, the\r\ntorpedo rays are able to ward off the attacks of enemies, and to kill\r\nor paralyze their prey. The action is that of a galvanic battery. The\r\ndorsal surface is positive, the ventral negative, and the discharge of\r\na large torpedo is sufficient to temporarily disable a man; yet it is\r\nnot so powerful as that from a big electric eel.\r\n\r\nThe huge \"sea devils\" of which thrilling stories are related are the\r\neagle rays of the family Myliobatidæ, some of which are fifteen or\r\ntwenty feet across the \"wings\"; and they are among the most frightful\r\nof the dangers to which pearl divers are exposed in their perilous\r\noccupation. They are savage beasts, and will even attack a small boat\r\nwith men in it. The worst of these belong to the vicinity of Panama.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n                        BONY FISHES--TELEOSTOMI\r\n\r\n\r\nWe come now to the fishes proper--those with skeletons of bone,\r\nalthough in some of the lower forms the ossification is incomplete. The\r\nmouth contains supplementary tooth-bearing bones that form secondary\r\njaws corresponding to the functional jaws of the higher craniates;\r\nhence the group name \"Teleostomi,\" or perfect-mouthed fishes. The body,\r\nas a rule, is coated with scales, and a gill cover (operculum) is\r\nalways present.\r\n\r\nThe Teleostomi include four orders, the Crossopterygii, the\r\nChondrostei, the Holostei, and the Teleostei.\r\n\r\nThe crossopterygians are mostly strange extinct fishes found as fossils\r\nfrom the Devonian down; but some have survived, and live in the\r\nsluggish African rivers an eellike existence, of which the bichir of\r\nthe Nile is a familiar example. The Chondrostei also are largely fishes\r\nof the Paleozoic time, but two families survive to the present--the\r\nspoonbills and the sturgeons. Of the former one species is Chinese,\r\nand the other is the shovel-nosed spoonbill or paddlefish of the lower\r\nMississippi River. It is a big, sluggish creature, that stirs up the\r\nmud with its long flat beak, and consumes it, getting sustenance from\r\nthe minute organisms it contains. They make caviar from its eggs. As\r\nfor the sturgeons, we have five species in the United States, and one\r\nabounds in the Black Sea and the rivers that drain into it, from whose\r\neggs the Russian caviar is made. One or two species are exclusively\r\nfresh-water, but most sturgeons are migratory fishes, living in the\r\nsea, but ascending rivers for spawning. Their food consists of worms,\r\nmollusks, the smaller fishes and aquatic plants; and in feeding the\r\nmouth is protruded downward in the form of a cylindrical, spout-like\r\nstructure and thrust into the mud. Our common eastern-coast sturgeon is\r\nalso a native of the Mediterranean and French coasts, and was formerly\r\nin England a \"royal\" fish, reserved to the king's use.\r\n\r\nOf the third order, Holostei or \"ganoids,\" whose history may be traced\r\nin fossils almost to the earliest of fossiliferous rocks, we possess\r\nin our rivers the only two survivors: one is the many-named bowfin of\r\nthe Mississippi Valley, and the other the widely distributed billfish\r\nor gar pike. Both these relics of a very ancient order are of great\r\ninterest to naturalists; and the names \"mudfish,\" \"John H. Grindle,\"\r\nand many others, show how well known the bowfin is to the farmer boys.\r\nThe bowfin attains a length of about two feet and a weight of twelve\r\npounds, and, unlike its cousins the garfishes, is covered with hard,\r\nrounded scales; the forepart of the body is cylindrical, the head stout\r\nand blunt, and the mouth filled with powerful teeth. It is exceedingly\r\nhardy, enduring absence from the water for a long time, as well as\r\ngrievous injury; hence the young are the favorite bait of anglers in\r\nthe Mississippi Valley, and make interesting captives in an aquarium,\r\nwhere, however, nothing else but snails can remain alive. These fish\r\nare strong, active, voracious and gamy. They feed on all sorts of small\r\naquatic creatures.\r\n\r\nThe garfish (or more properly gar pike, Lepidosteus, because certain\r\nsea fishes of another sort are also called gars) is an elongated active\r\nfish of our rivers, covered with hard, flat, ivorylike scales set in\r\noblique rows, and its snout is prolonged into a bill filled with sharp\r\nteeth. They have many peculiarities of structure indicating their\r\nancient ganoid lineage; and besides our common species two others are\r\nknown, one of which, the alligator gar, belongs to the Gulf Coast and\r\nCentral American rivers. These gars are nocturnal and predatory in\r\ntheir habits, and in early summer resort in large numbers to shallows\r\nto lay their eggs, which are covered with a sticky envelope that\r\nadheres to any object on which they fall. The long bill develops after\r\ninfancy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n                       MODERN FISHES--TELEOSTEI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lower orders of teleosts retain many characteristics of the\r\nHolostei, and several of their families are known only as fossils in\r\nthe Cretaceous and Tertiary rocks. The most primitive survivor of these\r\nancient forms is the great tarpon of Florida and southward, another\r\nspecies of which occurs in India--such wide differences in habitats\r\nbeing an evidence of antiquity in nearly all cases among animals. The\r\nextraordinary mormoids of northern Africa, and the eellike gymnarchus\r\nof Gambia, are other relics of the past, as also are several other\r\nqueer African families, the barramundi of Australia, and the arapaima\r\nof the Amazon region. The one last named is the largest fresh-water\r\nfish known, specimens exceeding fifteen feet in length, and weighing\r\n400 pounds, all of which is excellent food. The mother protects her\r\noffspring which, when young, swim in front of her. Several of these\r\nold-fashioned teleosts, like our bowfin and the primitive Dipneusti,\r\nmake elaborate nests in which their eggs are deposited, and they and\r\nthe fry are carefully guarded by the parent. In this same suborder come\r\nthe most familiar and useful game and food fishes--the shad, herring,\r\ntrout, salmon, whitefish, smelt, etc.\r\n\r\nThe shad family is a very large one, numbering about 200 species, most\r\nof which are marine, but a few are \"anadromous,\" that is, they ascend\r\nrivers of fresh water to spawn in the shallows near their sources.\r\nThis is the habit of American shad, of which there is only one species\r\nin spite of the many local names in use; and it is regarded by the\r\nfisheries authorities as the most valuable river fish in the country\r\nexcept the Chinook salmon; but the supply of it would have been\r\nexhausted long ago had it not been for the incessant and energetic\r\nmethods of replanting of fry, artificially bred, in all the eastern\r\nrivers, and the transplanting of them to rivers on the Pacific Coast,\r\nthe credit for which valuable public service belongs to the United\r\nStates Bureau of Fisheries.\r\n\r\nThe shad is to be found from Florida to Newfoundland. Little is known\r\nof its life in the ocean, but in spring it approaches the coast in\r\ngreat numbers, and may be had in the St. John's River in Florida in\r\nwinter, but it is not numerous until March. It next appears in the\r\nSavannah and Edisto Rivers, and so successively northward, the height\r\nof the run in the Potomac being in April, in the Delaware early in\r\nMay, and in the Miramichi River in New Brunswick late in May. The main\r\nbody ascends when the water temperature is 56 degrees to 66 degrees.\r\nThey come in successive schools, the males preceding the females. They\r\nascend the rivers, often nearly to their heads, and deposit their eggs\r\non suitable spawning grounds, pouring out about 30,000 in most cases.\r\nThe eggs are very small, semibuoyant, and usually require six to ten\r\ndays for hatching, depending, as does the whole operation, on favoring\r\ntemperature. After the spawning the shad show hunger, and will often\r\nbite at an angler's fly.\r\n\r\n\"The herring is beyond question the most important of food fishes in\r\nthe Atlantic, if not in the world,\" declared the late G. Brown Goode,\r\nformerly Assistant U. S. Fish Commissioner. It affords occupation for\r\nimmense fleets of boats, and thousands of men, nowhere more numerously\r\nthan in the North Sea and along the Norwegian coasts. Professor Huxley\r\nonce gave 3,000,000,000 as the number of herring taken annually from\r\nthe North Atlantic; but Dr. Goode showed that this was far too low an\r\nestimate, and added that it probably was \"no greater than the number\r\ncontained in a single shoal if it covers half a dozen square miles, and\r\nshoals of much greater size are on record. And ... at one and the same\r\ntime scores of shoals must be scattered through the North Sea and the\r\nNorth Atlantic, any one of which would go a long way toward supplying\r\nthe whole of man's consumption of herring.\" Herrings are surface\r\nswimmers, and their food consists of the small organisms, chiefly\r\ncrustaceous, which have been described as \"plankton\" in the early pages\r\nof this book. They themselves afford food to every predatory fish,\r\nsquid, whale, and bird that frequents their region (mainly north of the\r\nfortieth parallel of latitude), and which has the wit and ability to\r\nseize them. They move here and there in shoals for food, and in spring\r\nmigrate to the shallows and rivers of the northern coasts to spawn.\r\nBesides the Atlantic herring, a very similar species throngs in the\r\nNorth Pacific, and several others live in the Great Lakes and other\r\nwaters of this country.\r\n\r\nNo fishes are better known in America than the salmon, trout, and\r\nwhitefish, which are near relatives. Of the salmon there are many kinds\r\nin all the northern parts of the world and in the open ocean. Some\r\nascend rivers to spawn, and some do not. Our Atlantic salmon, once so\r\nabundant in every river from Connecticut northward, is the same as the\r\nsalmon of Europe, and the king of game fish. Now it is at all numerous\r\nonly in the Maritime Provinces of Canada, climbing the waterfalls of\r\nthose mountain streams to their very springs to deposit its eggs,\r\nwhence few individuals survive to return to the ocean. The heaviest\r\nsalmon on record is one of eighty-three pounds captured in England in\r\n1821; an American example of forty pounds is considered very large.\r\n\r\nThe salmon of the North Pacific are of a different genus\r\n(Onchorhynchus) and consist of several species, some Asiatic. On the\r\nAmerican side we have five species, and most of them have been seen in\r\nall the rivers from central California to Alaska, Siberia and Japan;\r\nbut the blueback predominates in Fraser River and in the Yukon; the\r\nsilver salmon in Puget Sound; the quinnat or Chinook salmon in the\r\nColumbia and Sacramento; while the comparatively worthless dog salmon\r\nis seen everywhere. The quinnat and blueback enter and \"run\" the\r\nrivers in the spring, and are caught when in prime condition, whereas\r\nthe other three run in the fall, and are more usually caught after\r\ndeterioration; hence \"spring\" salmon are best in fact and in trade.\r\n\r\nThe habits of the salmon in the ocean are not easily studied, but\r\nJordan, Evermann, and other diligent students have come to certain\r\nconclusions from a great number of facts. They believe that the king\r\nand the silver salmon probably remain not far from the rivers where\r\nthey were born. The blueback and dog salmon probably seek deeper\r\nwater. It is the prevailing impression that the salmons have some\r\nspecial instinct which leads them to return to spawn on the same\r\ngrounds where they were hatched, but Dr. Jordan says:\r\n\r\n\"We fail to find any evidence of this. It seems more probable that the\r\nyoung salmon hatched in any river mostly remain in the ocean within\r\na radius of twenty, thirty or forty miles of its mouth. These, in\r\ntheir movements about in the ocean, may come into contact with the\r\ncold waters of their parent river, or perhaps of any other river, at a\r\nconsiderable distance from shore. In the case of the quinnat and the\r\nblueback, their 'instinct' seems to lead them to ascend these fresh\r\nwaters, and in a majority of cases these waters will be those in which\r\nthe fishes in question were originally spawned.\"\r\n\r\nAs to the fate of the spawning fish, after the eggs and milt have been\r\nvoided, and their duty is done, the salmon begin to float downstream\r\ntail foremost. The great majority of them die--certainly all at the\r\nheadwaters of the big streams; and it is the opinion of the best\r\njudges that none ever get back from anywhere alive into the ocean\r\nafter spawning, but that the race is sustained wholly by the escape of\r\nthe young each year. It is supposed that non return from the sea, or\r\nattempt to ascend the rivers until at least three years old.\r\n\r\nTrout are in most cases simply small species of salmon, and a great\r\nnumber of kinds inhabit the ocean, lakes, and rivers of all northern\r\ncountries, for none of this great family occur in the tropics or in\r\nthe southern hemisphere. Our western trout--the widely distributed\r\nand variable cutthroat, the steel-head of the northwestern coast, the\r\nbeautiful rainbow trout of the Coast Ranges, and others are examples.\r\nThe common brown \"brook\" trout of Great Britain belongs here; but\r\nour brook trout, the \"speckled beauty\" of anglers and poets, is of a\r\nslightly different kind (genus Salvelinus), for it is classed with the\r\nEuropean charrs. The Dolly Varden trout of the Rocky Mountains and the\r\nSunapee trout are also charrs. The graylings, namaycushes, and smelts\r\nare members of this family, whose final representative among us is the\r\nnumerous and very valuable section of whitefish and lake herrings of\r\nthe Great Lakes and Canada generally.\r\n\r\nNo family of fish is of more importance as food for man, not to speak\r\nof the sport many of its members afford, than this; yet, doubtless, it\r\nwould have been nearly destroyed by this time had it not been for the\r\nintelligent and patient work of fish culturists and the farsightedness\r\nof governments, both Federal and State, and Canadian, in supporting and\r\nextending economic replenishing of depleted waters. The organization\r\nand breeding habits of the salmon tribe lend themselves to this work.\r\n\r\nPassing by some families of deep-sea fishes, of small size and most\r\nbizarre outlines, we come to the suborder that contains the carps,\r\ncatfishes and \"minnows\" of our lakes and streams. Here, the first\r\nto present itself, in the large family Characinidæ, is that fierce\r\nlittle brute of South American rivers, the \"piranha\" or \"caribe,\" of\r\nwhich Col. Theodore Roosevelt had so much to say in describing his\r\nexplorations in Brazil in 1913 and 1914. One of his companions was Leo\r\nE. Miller, who has since published another account and increases the\r\nbad reputation of the caribe by what he has to tell of its ferocity:\r\n\r\n\"In the Orinoco they attain a weight exceeding three pounds, and are\r\nformidable indeed. The natives will not go in bathing except in very\r\nshallow water, and I know of two instances where men were attacked and\r\nseverely bitten before they could escape. The fish somewhat resembles a\r\nbass in shape, although the mouth is smaller; the jaws are armed with\r\ntriangular, razor-edged teeth; and as they travel in immense shoals\r\nthey are capable of easily devouring a man or large animal if caught in\r\ndeep water.... Usually they are slow to attack unless their appetite\r\nhas been whetted by a taste of blood from a wound; then, however, their\r\nwork is done with lightninglike quickness.... To catch them we used a\r\nlarge hook secured to a long wire leader and baited with any kind of\r\nraw meat, and they always put up a good fight.\"\r\n\r\nA related fish in the Rio La Plata is almost equally dreaded because of\r\nits much greater size and formidable teeth, but it works singly; and\r\nAfrica has many similar characinids, whose flesh is good food, though\r\nfull of bones. In this order, too, is now classified the family of the\r\n\"electric eels\" (Gymnotidæ) which are not, however, eels, but merely\r\nlong, cylindrical fishes, naked and almost finless. The well-known one\r\nof the Amazon region grows to a length of eight feet and the thickness\r\nof a man's thigh, and is justly feared. It is found only in marshes and\r\nin comparatively shallow parts of rivers, to the annoyance of travelers\r\nwho have to ford at such points, beasts of burden being frequently\r\nknocked down by the electric shocks. About four-fifths of the length of\r\nthe fish is occupied by the tail, which contains the electric organ.\r\nThis consists of two huge masses filled with a jellylike substance,\r\nbelow the spine, and separated by a narrow median septum. This\r\napparatus is under the control of the fish, which by it may stun or\r\nkill an enemy or an intended prey, even at a considerable distance.\r\n\r\nThe family of the cyprinids--the carp, goldfish, chubs, shiners,\r\nloaches, and other \"minnows\" of this and other countries--contains\r\nabout 1,300 species, scattered over the whole world except South\r\nAmerica, Madagascar, and Australasia. All are fresh-water fishes,\r\nfeeding on vegetation and small animals; and they vary in size from two\r\nor three inches to a six-foot carp--the original home of which, now the\r\ncosmopolitan giant of the family, was Asia.\r\n\r\nNext to these are placed another extensive fresh-water family, that of\r\nthe catfishes (Siluridæ). More than 1,000 species, mostly tropical,\r\nhave been described; these are grouped in eight subfamilies, among\r\nwhich there is a wide diversity in shape and habits--in fact, few of\r\nthose of foreign lands look at all like the catfishes with which we\r\nare familiar in America. Most of them are sluggish, but some actively\r\ninhabit swift streams. They can exist not only in foul water, but\r\nwill live a long time out of this element, and some even make long\r\nmigrations overland from river to river. One or more fin rays are sharp\r\nand poisonous in many species, as boys know who handle the little\r\nbullhead incautiously, and an African species is able to administer\r\na strong electric shock. Its apparatus is not a battery of modified\r\nmuscular tissue, as in other electric fishes, but consists of a thick\r\ncoat of greasy material surrounding the whole body just beneath the\r\nskin. Another general characteristic is the protection and assiduous\r\ncare given to their eggs and young, most species making some sort of a\r\nnest in which the eggs are deposited and the fry kept safe from attack.\r\n\r\nThe third suborder of teleosts contains eellike fishes of the tropics;\r\nand the fourth contains the true eels and their relatives. Our common\r\neel is also \"common\" in most of the temperate countries of the world,\r\nbut there are perhaps 150 other species of the family Anguillidæ, a\r\nlarge proportion of which live altogether in the sea, many of them at\r\ngreat depths, and showing strange shapes. The generation of the eel\r\nwas, until recent years, one of the great mysteries of zoölogy, as\r\nno propagation, or any symptoms of it, ever appear in fresh water.\r\nFinally it was discovered that a queer, almost transparent, compressed\r\ncreature, a fraction of an inch long that abounded in the surface\r\nwaters of the ocean, and which had been a puzzle to naturalists, who\r\ncalled it Leptocephalus, was the larva of some sort of eel. This and\r\nother discoveries made it plain that when the eels (of the age of four\r\nor five years) leave the rivers and bays of all countries and coasts\r\nin the autumn, and go out to sea, they do so to spawn, leaving their\r\neggs on the floor of the ocean, mostly south of Bermuda, according to\r\nJ. Schmidt. From them hatch the minute larvæ that, as they grow, rise\r\nto the surface, and when about a year old appear as the silvery young,\r\ncalled \"elvers,\" that drift on the northward-running currents to the\r\ncoasts of Europe and North America, and ascend the streams by millions\r\nin spring. It is not probable that any of the adult eels that go down\r\nto the sea to spawn ever come back; and if any remain in landlocked\r\nwaters whence they cannot migrate to the salt water, they do not breed;\r\nbut it must be remembered that eels are able to travel a considerable\r\ndistance overland, at night, from one piece of water to another, and\r\nso many may finally reach the sea.\r\n\r\nThe next suborder illustrates the remarkable difference in size and\r\nexternal appearance that often marks fishes grouped together by\r\nsimilarity of structure. It includes the muskellunge and all the other\r\npikes and pickerels, and the tiny shiners and \"bait minnows\" of our\r\nrivers and brooks, and those of the Old World, one of which is the\r\nsmallest fish known; it includes several families of deep-sea fishes,\r\noften of quaint form and with curious appendages; here, too, is the\r\nvaluable blackfish of Alaska, the amphibious, phosphorescent little\r\nfish of Indian bays and estuaries which when salted and dried forms the\r\nOriental delicacy called \"Bombay duck\"; and here are the blind fishes\r\nof the Mammoth and other American caves. The Heteromi and Cateosteomi\r\nare almost equally miscellaneous assemblages, the most notable members\r\nof the latter being the funny little pipefishes and sea horses that\r\nlurk in the eelgrass near shore, and the males of which carry the\r\neggs and young about in a pouch on the belly. In the next suborder,\r\nPerceosces, we find more strange denizens of the mid-oceanic depths,\r\nespecially the family Chiasmodontidæ, besides some surface ones of\r\nancient lineage, such as the gar and snakeheads of tropical waters,\r\nthe flying fish and the mullets. The Anacanthini is a small group\r\ncontaining the remarkable pelagic and abyssal macrurids, the fierce\r\nbarracudas, and the most valuable single family of food fishes in the\r\nwhole list--the cods.\r\n\r\nThe cod family (Gadidæ) has many species in northern seas and a few\r\nsouth of the equator. It includes, besides the cods, the haddock, hake,\r\nwhiting, coalfish, capelin, ling, and several other market fish of\r\nimportance. The cod is a deep-water fish which goes about in great\r\nschools whose movements are not well understood, but in winter they\r\napproach the northern shores of the continent, seeking shallows on\r\nwhich to spawn, and it is then on the \"banks,\" off New England and\r\nNewfoundland, that the most profitable fisheries are followed. The cod\r\nis extraordinarily prolific, and in addition to this it is propagated\r\nartificially more extensively than any other fish.\r\n\r\nThus we come to the last suborder, Acanthopterygii, or \"spiny-finned\"\r\nfishes, in which are classified the greater number of really modern\r\nand more or less familiar swimmers in the \"briny deep.\" Among American\r\nmembers are the sunfishes and black bass, the perches and darters;\r\nthe great family (Serranidæ) of sea bass, snappers and West Indian\r\ngroupers; the tilefish, which appears and disappears in a puzzling\r\nfashion; the grunting drums and their relatives of the Scienidæ; the\r\nporgies, sheepshead, and other Sparidæ; the brilliantly colored angel\r\nfish of the coral reefs of Bermuda and southward; the surf fishes, so\r\nimportant in California; the wrasses, parrot fish, and globefishes, or\r\nboxfishes, that inflate their horny hides when alarmed, until they bob\r\nabout on the surface like corks.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      FISHES WITH PRIMITIVE LUNGS\r\n\r\nThere remains the fourth subclass--Dipnoi or Dipneusti, the lungfishes.\r\nThe reason why these creatures, whose organization is on an antique and\r\nlowly plane, judged by fish standards, have been elevated to subclass\r\nrank is that here the air bladder is modified into a single or double\r\nelongated sac with many cellular spaces, and is connected by a short\r\ntube with the mouth, and thus serves as a lung. The peculiar structure\r\nof the heart, narial openings, and the power of existing for a\r\nconsiderable period out of water, are extremely amphibianlike, and they\r\nhave by various naturalists been regarded as scaly sirens--a sort of\r\nconnecting link between the fishes and the amphibians. They are found\r\nfossil in Paleozoic rocks, especially in the Old Red Sandstone of Great\r\nBritain, and also in the Upper Jurassic strata in Colorado.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN AFRICAN LUNGFISH\r\n  (_Protopterus annectens_)]\r\n\r\nThe surviving species (family Lepidosirenidæ) are widely scattered,\r\nas is characteristic of all these very ancient families. A celebrated\r\nexample is the barramundi of Queensland--an elongated, flat-sided fish,\r\ncovered, except on the head, with large roundish scales, and having\r\npaired fins that look more like flippers than fins. It becomes four\r\nor five feet long. It lives in still pools in which the water in the\r\ndry season becomes extremely stagnant and overladen with decomposing\r\nvegetable matter; and it is only by rising to the surface occasionally,\r\nand taking air into its lung, that it is enabled to obtain sufficient\r\noxygen for purposes of respiration. The barramundi does not leave the\r\nwater, nor can it live long in the air. It is easily captured, and is\r\neaten by the blackfellows.\r\n\r\nEquatorial Africa possesses three species of the genus Protopterus,\r\nwhich dwell in marshes, and feed voraciously on young fishes, frogs,\r\nand small animals. The form is somewhat eellike, and the paired fins\r\nare soft, slender appendages of little use, locomotion being effected\r\nby the powerful tail. Like the barramundi this fish rises at intervals\r\nto take a breath of air; its \"lungs\" are double, while that of the\r\nbarramundi is single. In the dry time of summer the protopterus burrows\r\ndeeply into the mud of the dried-up marshes, where it curls up with its\r\nhead highest and subsists wholly by breathing air until the autumnal\r\nrains bring water enough to enable it to wake up and resume its aquatic\r\nlife. A similar eellike species abounds in the swamps, sluggish rivers\r\nand marshes of northern South America, named Lepidosiren, and all its\r\nhabits closely resemble those of the African lungfishes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n                     AMPHIBIANS--A CONNECTING LINK\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now come to a class of vertebrates that in their manner of\r\nlife, and presumably in their history, connect the dwellers in the\r\nwaters with those on the lands of the globe. Dr. Gamble cites examples\r\nfrom various groups of animals to show that adaptation to a terrestrial\r\nexistence is an advance on that requisite for aquatic life, and that\r\nthe critical point in the evolution of the vertebrate phylum was passed\r\nwhen its members migrated from water to land. \"When we come to land\r\nanimals,\" he says, \"the problem of weight has to be considered before\r\nthat of locomotion. The lateral undulations of the body, even when\r\naided by unjointed paddles, or fins, are not sufficient to insure rapid\r\nmovement on land. Hence a system of levers has to be evolved, partly to\r\nsupport the body, and partly to propel it. The use of joints becomes\r\na necessity, and we find that all active terrestrial animals, except\r\nsnakes, have jointed limbs. The critical point in the history of this\r\nphylum is passed when its members migrated from water to the land. The\r\nstep was taken by the ancestors of the Amphibia (that is, the frogs,\r\ntoads, and salamanders). In them the breast fins of the fish have\r\nbecome the jointed forelegs, the pelvic fins have become the hind legs.\"\r\n\r\nHow this great change from the fish fin to the five-fingered hand\r\noccurred is, at present, just as obscure as the mode of conversion\r\nof the arms of reptiles into the wings of birds. The answer can only\r\nbe supplied by further discoveries in the geological history of the\r\norder, and though this history can be traced back to the time of the\r\nCoal Measures, we find the earliest Amphibia as sharply marked off\r\nfrom the fishes by their feet as they are to-day. These forefathers\r\n(subclass Stegocephalia) are the earliest known four-footed animals,\r\nand their fossil skeletons are found from the Carboniferous up to the\r\nTrias, after which the race disappears. They had the general form of\r\nnewts, and many were only a few inches in length. That some of these,\r\nat least, were terrestrial in habit is shown by the fact that they are\r\noften found in stumps and hollow logs of sigillarias and other fossil\r\ntrees of the coal beds, especially in Nova Scotia. But there were also\r\nspecies several feet in length, with formidable teeth, which were no\r\ndoubt carnivorous and predatory, so that it was well for the little\r\nones to seek places of safety. These stegocephalians were unmistakably\r\namphibians, with two condyles supporting the skull, but their skeleton\r\ncontains many features that suggest reptilian anatomy, and it is agreed\r\nthat the reptiles sprang from this stock. The peculiar feature of this\r\ngroup is that their flattish heads were covered by a broad shield of\r\nbony plates (ossified skin); and similar armor protected their bellies,\r\nand in a few cases the back also.\r\n\r\nGeological formations furnish no ancestral connection between the\r\nStegocephalia and modern salamanders; but the limbless, wormlike,\r\nburrowing and blind cæcilians of the tropics exhibit certain\r\nstegocephalian characteristics, especially a scaly skin, which put them\r\ninto a division (Apoda) by themselves. The remainder of the class,\r\nthat is, Amphibia (also called Batrachia) in general, have a soft,\r\nmoist, naked skin, and are naturally divisible into two orders:\r\n\r\n    1. _Urodela_--Tailed amphibians: newts and salamanders.\r\n    2. _Anura_--Tailless amphibians: frogs and toads.\r\n\r\nModern amphibians in general are animals fitted for life both on land\r\nand in water. All are born from eggs hatched in water, and the young,\r\nat first in a larval form unlike the adult condition, have external\r\ngills adapted to breathing in that element; but in most cases they\r\nlose their gills, and as adults acquire lungs for breathing air. This\r\nmetamorphosis of the young, comparable to that of the nymph-producing\r\ninsects, is the especial characteristic of the class. The skeleton is\r\nof the vertebrate model, but in the Urodela is largely cartilaginous.\r\nThe skin is smooth, soft, moist, and covered only with a filmy coat\r\nof horny texture that is molted from time to time as the animal needs\r\nroom to grow. The skin abounds in sense organs about the head and\r\nalong the sides of the body--an inheritance from the lateral line of\r\nfishes--which are most active in the larvæ, and disappear altogether\r\nwith age in most frogs and toads, although they revive in salamanders\r\nin the breeding season.\r\n\r\nThe skin also contains many mucus glands and other larger glands,\r\nespecially on the back. These emit under provocation a poisonous liquid\r\nthat is fatal to small animals, and very irritating to the eyes, nose,\r\nand throat of larger ones. Most, if not all, Amphibia, says Dr. Gadow,\r\nare more or less poisonous, and it is significant that many of the most\r\npoisonous exhibit a very conspicuous yellow or orange upon a dark\r\nground, which is so widespread a sign of poison. There is no venom in\r\ntheir bite--in fact, their teeth are too small, although numerous, to\r\nlet anyone fear their biting. The skin is heavily laden with pigment,\r\nand this is displayed in many amphibians in striking patterns of bright\r\ncoloring. Certain groups possess in a high degree the power of altering\r\ntheir colors to conform to their surroundings.\r\n\r\nAn interesting feature of the amphibians is that power of repairing\r\nmutilations of the body and replacing lost parts which is so well\r\nknown in worms, hydroids, and other lowly creatures, and is termed\r\n\"regeneration.\" This ability is most active in young specimens.\r\nTadpoles frequently have their tails bitten off, whereupon new ones\r\ngrow quickly. Salamanders fight bitterly, tearing off each other's\r\ngills and limbs, and turtles and fishes frequently bite off their\r\ntails. New tails are generated speedily, and usually in good and\r\neffective form, although they contain no regenerated caudal vertebræ,\r\nbut only a rod of cartilage. The ability to rebuild lost parts is much\r\nless among the frogs.\r\n\r\nAnother notable fact is that here for the first time we meet with a\r\nvoice organ, and a real voice expressing emotions, although in an\r\nextremely limited way. This is most noticeable in the tree frogs, which\r\nare the most advanced of the Amphibia in organization.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         NEWTS AND SALAMANDERS\r\n\r\nThe Urodela are represented throughout the whole northern hemisphere\r\nexcept in desert regions, as far in North America as southern Canada,\r\nand also southward to Panama; and in the Old World, northward to\r\nthe line of very cold winters and southward to the Mediterranean and\r\nIndo-China. In the main, however, our genera are different from those\r\nof Europe and Asia.\r\n\r\nThe largest and best known of American urodeles is a member of the\r\nfamily Proteidæ and genus Necturus, and is widely known as \"water\r\ndog\" or \"mud puppy,\" because of the doglike shape of its head. It is\r\na brown, robust creature, sometimes two feet long, with bushy gills,\r\nretained throughout its life, springing from open gill clefts in\r\nthree bright red tufts on each side of the head. It inhabits cold,\r\nrapid streams, hiding under stones by day, and moving about at night\r\nin search of crawfish, worms, insect larvæ, frogs, etc., and dodging\r\nhungry snapping turtles. But little smaller, and even more ugly in\r\nappearance, is the \"hellbender,\" representing the family Amphiumidæ.\r\nThese blackish creatures are to be found in mountainous regions, and\r\nhide during the day under loose rocks. By the time they are about\r\nthree years old their gills have been absorbed, and their lungs are in\r\nservice, so that they are compelled to rise to the surface occasionally\r\nfor drafts of air. They hunt at night for food, preferring crawfish\r\nand, fishermen say, fish eggs. The breeding habits of this animal\r\nhave only lately become known, and Mr. B. G. Smith, who has made a\r\nspecial investigation of them, says that the breeding season begins (in\r\nPennsylvania) in August, when hellbenders of both sexes come out more\r\nfreely from their rock shelters and roam about, frequently in small\r\ncompanies. The small number of eggs produced are hidden in a pocket\r\nunder a loose stone; and the young, which are more like tadpoles than\r\nthe form of their parents, breathe by gills which do not completely\r\ndisappear until the animals have reached nearly their maturity.\r\n\r\nOtherwise our salamanders are small species found in brooks, ponds, and\r\nwet woods, and often getting into cellars and wells. Uninformed persons\r\nthink them to be lizards, and foolishly fear them, but except for the\r\nirritation of the hands that may follow rough handling they are utterly\r\nharmless to man or his property, and serve him by devouring great\r\nquantities of insects and worms.\r\n\r\nA common species in damp, neglected woodlands is the little red-backed\r\nfellow that is so light and leaping in its movements when disturbed,\r\neven throwing off its tail in its panic of fear. It is more terrestrial\r\nthan most, laying its few eggs in rotting wood instead of going into\r\nthe water for that purpose; and the young carry gills but a few days.\r\nThis red-backed Plethodon must not be confused with the small newts,\r\nbright vermilion with a row of glowing spots along the sides, that are\r\nfound in woods in summer. They are young specimens of _Diemyctylus\r\nviridescens_, which is common all over the eastern part of the United\r\nStates and southern Ontario. The parents are green, and wholly aquatic\r\nin habits. The larvæ have gills and swim about until early autumn,\r\nby which time their gills have been gradually absorbed, and they go\r\nashore, where their coats change in color from a mottled green to\r\nscarlet. This red condition and their residence on land continue until\r\nthe autumn of the third, or the spring of the fourth year of their\r\nlives, when they become sexually mature, resume a greenish dress, go\r\nback to the water, and pass the rest of their lives there.\r\n\r\nMention can be made of only one more species--the black, yellow-spotted\r\n\"tiger triton,\" which is the most widely spread and often seen of\r\nour terrestrial salamanders. It is especially noteworthy because of\r\nthe extraordinary condition of suspended development exhibited by its\r\nlarva, the famous edible axolotl of Mexican lakes, which, while still\r\nretaining larval gills and aquatic habits, grows nearly or quite to\r\nthe size of its parents--three to four inches--and becomes capable of\r\nbreeding. Similar cases are known in certain lakes in southern Europe;\r\nand it appears that this arrested development, together with natural\r\ngrowth of body, occurs occasionally in many other amphibians. The\r\ncondition is termed \"neotony,\" but the biological explanation of it is\r\nnot clear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n                        AMPHIBIANS--_Continued_\r\n\r\n\r\n                       FROGS, TOADS AND TADPOLES\r\n\r\nThe frogs and toads of the order Anura differ from the inferior\r\nbatrachians principally in form. The tail is absent, and instead of\r\nlong, slender bodies and small legs, or none, they have short, squat,\r\ntriangular bodies and hind legs, at least, of relatively great size and\r\nstrength, whereby they progress when on land by leaps instead of by\r\nrunning or creeping; some are almost wholly aquatic in habit, others\r\nalmost wholly terrestrial or arboreal. The ossification of the bones is\r\nfar more complete, the eyes and ears (represented by the large tightly\r\ndrawn membrane, the \"tympanum,\" on each side of the head, covering the\r\ninternal ear) are well developed, and the voice is louder than in the\r\nurodeles, which can do little more than squeak. The mouth is usually\r\nlarge and cleft to beyond the eyes. The tongue, used to capture prey,\r\nis not thrust straight forward, but thrown \"overhand,\" as it were,\r\ncatching the insect aimed at in its curling and sticky tip.\r\n\r\nAll frogs and toads are flesh eaters, mainly of worms and insects\r\nand larval or small water animals; but the big species, such as the\r\nbullfrog, may seize prey of considerable size as it comes within\r\nreach, such as young ducklings. None hunt about for prey, but, aided\r\nby the concealing nature of their colors, wait quietly until a victim\r\ncomes within reach of their quick and accurate tongues. All lay their\r\neggs in still water, varying in number from a few score to several\r\nthousands, according to the species. In all cases the young are hatched\r\nin a larval form, called \"tadpole,\" having a tail and gills, and\r\nthis gradually changes into the adult, tailless form of the adult.\r\nOn emerging from the egg the embryo has a very large head and body.\r\nIn a frog the external gills and the long, compressed tail are only\r\nfeebly developed when the tadpole is first hatched, while the mouth is\r\nprovided with a much developed adhesive apparatus, by means of which\r\nthe young attach themselves to plants or other objects. The tadpole\r\nchanges by regular stages into the adult form, the tail being slowly\r\nabsorbed into the body from which the legs grow out.\r\n\r\nThe Anura are separable into two suborders:\r\n\r\n    1. _Aglossa_--Having no tongue.\r\n    2. _Phaneroglossa_--Possessed of a tongue.\r\n\r\nThe Aglossa are few in number, and belong to southern Africa and\r\ntropical America, where the group is represented by the famous Surinam\r\ntoad, whose eggs are fixed in separate pits or \"pouches\" in the spongy\r\nskin of the mother's back, where they are placed as fast as laid, by\r\naid of the male.\r\n\r\nThe Phaneroglossa contains several families, the first of which,\r\nDiscoglossidæ, is characterized by the round, nonprotrusible tongue,\r\nand includes species of toads belonging mainly to the Mediterranean\r\nregion, two of which are familiar to most readers of natural histories.\r\n\r\nIt may be well to say at this point that the terms \"toad\" and \"frog\"\r\ndo not express scientific distinctions, although generally applied by\r\nnaturalists to the first three families of the list, and especially\r\nto the Bufonidæ; but mark the facts of popular observation that the\r\nmembers of these families are more terrestrial than the members of the\r\nfamilies that follow them, and that they have rough warty skins in\r\nplace of smooth and shiny ones; but many exceptions confuse both the\r\nclassification and the use of the words--as, for example, in the case\r\nof the hylas, which you may call either \"tree frogs\" or \"tree toads,\"\r\naccording to your liking.\r\n\r\nThe two species mentioned above are the \"unke,\" or firebellied toad\r\nof Germany, which when alarmed displays its scarlet underparts by a\r\npeculiar attitude calculated to surprise and frighten away an enemy.\r\nThe other is the \"midwife toad,\" most common in Spain and Portugal.\r\n\r\nThe spade-foot toads (Pelobatidæ) are a strangely distributed family\r\ninhabiting the western United States, Mexico, eastern Europe, and the\r\nIndo-Malayan region. Their special characteristic is the fact that\r\nthe inner tarsal tubercle is large and is transformed into a shovel,\r\nwhich is covered with a hard, sharp-edged, horny sheath. Having this\r\nexcellent tool these small and noisy toads rapidly excavate deep holes\r\nin the soil, preferring sand, and lie hidden during the day, but come\r\nforth at night to hunt. They resort to water only for a week or so\r\nof egg-laying in the spring, and remain unknown to most persons in\r\nwhose neighborhood they are really numerous. Our common American one\r\n(_Scaphiophus solitarius_) is about two inches long, and brown above\r\nwith darker patches.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to the typical toads, Bufonidæ, represented in all parts\r\nof the world except certain islands. A hundred pages might be filled\r\nwith interesting accounts of the manners and customs of the hundred or\r\nso species, many very different from those familiar to us.\r\n\r\nAll breed in water, resorting to ponds and pools in the early spring.\r\nWhere many broods have hatched the young can be met with in myriads,\r\nthe ground literally swarming with them; and as they are naturally\r\nstirred up by a sudden warm rain, perhaps after a drought, people will\r\noccasionally affirm as an observed and well-ascertained fact that \"it\r\nhas rained toads\"--something that never occurs except in the very rare\r\ncases when a cyclone has scooped the water and everything in it out of\r\na pond and scattered it abroad.\r\n\r\nMost of these young, migrating toads disappear as food for birds,\r\nsnakes, etc., or die of disease. The food of young and old consists of\r\ninsects, worms, snails, and the like; and it is an easy thing to tame\r\ntoads and have much amusement in watching them at work in the early\r\nevening, for they are crepuscular in habits; and the wise gardener will\r\nsee that they are not disturbed in their beneficial service of catching\r\nand devouring insect pests, unless they are so numerous as to be a\r\nnuisance.\r\n\r\nThe smallest North American toad is the oak toad of the Southern\r\nStates, which is only an inch long. When, in the breeding season, these\r\ndiminutive toads flock to the pools in great numbers, they keep up an\r\near-splitting chorus of shrill _peeps_, like so many young chickens.\r\n\r\n\r\n              FROGS AS NURSERY MAIDS AND WEATHER PROPHETS\r\n\r\nThe tree frogs are a very large family (Hylidæ) distributed all over\r\nthe world, except Africa, but most of the species belong to the\r\nsteamy forests of tropical America. All are of small size, have smooth\r\nskins, normally greenish, but very changeable in color to adapt the\r\ncreatures to the hue of their surroundings, as a protective device;\r\nand most of them inhabit trees. To enable them to do this the toes end\r\nin expanded, padlike disks, the contraction of which, when the foot\r\nis pressed against a surface, produces one or more furrows and, in\r\naddition, causes the exudation of a little mucilaginous liquid. The\r\nfoot pressed against the surface expels the air, and this fact, aided\r\nby the stickiness of the pad, enables the frog to hold on to even a\r\nvertical plane of glass. All Hylidæ have a voice, often very loud, and\r\nenhanced by membranous sacs under or on each side of the throat, or in\r\nsome cases internal; this sac, when blown out may be almost as large\r\nas the creature's body, as may be seen in our common gray tree frog\r\nwhen \"singing.\" This species, like most others, becomes very noisy in\r\nthe evening, in cloudy weather and before rain, with its not unmusical\r\ncroaking; and a similar European species is kept in confinement by some\r\npeople as an interesting pet and weather prophet.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting thing about the Hylidæ is their various methods of\r\nbreeding, for while most of them lay their eggs, up to a thousand in\r\nnumber, in the water, many produce but a few, and attach them to the\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nA large tree frog called in Brazil \"ferreiro\" (smith), makes a sound\r\nlike a mallet slowly and regularly struck on a metal plate. This frog\r\nactually builds a nursery in the shallow edge of a pond, where a\r\nbasin-shaped hollow, with a rim, is formed by the broad-handed female.\r\nHere she leaves her eggs, safe from egg-eating fishes or insects, as\r\nthe rim forms a wall higher than the surface of the water. A Japanese\r\nfrog makes a similar basin, then produces a liquid which she kicks into\r\na froth, and into the midst of this the eggs are dropped, and there the\r\nhatched larvæ develop, and remain until the gradual collapse of the mud\r\nrim sets them free.\r\n\r\nIn these and similar cases the eggs and tadpoles are abandoned by the\r\nparents; but many frogs watch over and care for their young. Some carry\r\nthe young in a pouch on the back, but how it is accomplished is not\r\nknown. A West African species carries its eggs in its mouth; and the\r\nmale of Darwin's frog, of Chile, carries the eggs in a great vocal\r\npouch beneath its throat, which subsequently forms a nursery for the\r\ntadpoles until they emerge as young frogs.\r\n\r\nIt must be noted, however, that some of these examples belong to\r\nthe related family Cystignathidæ--a very extensive family largely\r\nrepresented in Central and South America.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the tailless amphibians are assembled in the numerous\r\nand widely distributed family Ranidæ, which is that of the \"true\"\r\nfrogs. The typical subfamily, Raninæ, is cosmopolitan, except as to\r\nAustralia and South America south of the Amazon basin; but some less\r\ntypical forms are confined to the tropics, and include several strange\r\nspecies, such as the little arboreal Dendrobates frogs of Brazil, one\r\nof which is famous for furnishing in the secretion of its skin a dye\r\nthat when properly applied turns the green plumage of tame parrots into\r\nyellow--a fashionable tint. These small and pretty frogs are noted for\r\ntheir solicitude for their young, carrying baby tadpoles on their\r\nbacks--where the infants creep and become attached--from place to\r\nplace, as safety or better water conditions suggest.\r\n\r\nThe North American frogs are good examples of the ranine race, and\r\nthose more commonly seen are the following:\r\n\r\nLeopard frog (_Rana pipiens_), green with irregular black blotches,\r\nmostly in two rows on the back; legs barred above; belly pale. Eastern\r\nspecimens are more olive than bright green.\r\n\r\nPickerel frog (_R. palustris_), light brown with two rows of large,\r\noblong, square blotches of dark brown on the back, a brown spot above\r\neach eye, and a dark line from the nostril to the eye; upper jaw white\r\nand black. Habitat, eastern United States among mountains.\r\n\r\nWood frog (_R. sylvatica_), pale reddish brown; a black band across the\r\npointed face. This smallest of our species is to be found only in damp\r\nwoods, resorting to water only in early spring to deposit its eggs; and\r\nit is almost silent.\r\n\r\nGreen, or spring frog (_R. clamatans_), green or bronze-brown, brighter\r\nin front, with more or less small black spots; yellowish white below.\r\nThis is a rather solitary frog, living in springs and small ponds,\r\nwhere it utters the familiar \"chung\" at frequent intervals. It is\r\ndistinguished by the enormous size of its eardrum.\r\n\r\nBullfrog (_R. catesbiana_), greenish, brightest on the head, and with\r\nsmall dark spots on its back; legs blotched; eardrum large; toes\r\nbroadly webbed. Length five to eight inches, breadth four to five\r\ninches. It utters a roar not unlike that of a distant bull, and a\r\ncompany of them on a still summer evening will awaken the neighborhood.\r\nBullfrogs are present throughout the eastern United States and Canada,\r\nwest to the dry plains; and furnish the market with \"saddles\" (their\r\nhind legs) as a table delicacy when fried. These frogs may lay 12,000\r\neggs apiece.\r\n\r\nAll our frogs lay their eggs in water in rounded masses, not in\r\nstrings, as do the toads, usually attached to some submerged stick or\r\nplant stem. The tadpoles, light in color, are very voracious, and feed\r\non every sort of flesh that they can bite off and chew with their horny\r\njaws. On the approach of winter the frogs--except the wood frog, which\r\nhibernates in the loam of the forest, or in some rotten stump--sink\r\ninto the mud of the pond or marsh where they live, and pass the cold\r\nmonths in torpidity. Their food is almost exclusively insects, caught\r\nby the tongue, but the big bullfrogs seize with their mouths any small\r\ncreature that comes their way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n               REPTILES--MONARCHS OF THE MESOZOIC WORLD\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is a reptile? It is a cold-blooded, air-breathing vertebrate, with\r\none occipital condyle, complete right and left aortic arches, red blood\r\nand a covering of scales. The classification of the class (Reptilia)\r\nrecognizes the existence of many distinct subdivisions, as follows:\r\n\r\n    _Proreptilia_ (extinct).\r\n    _Prosauria_ (extinct, except the tuatara).\r\n    _Theromorpha_ (extinct).\r\n    _Chelonia_--Turtles; tortoises.\r\n    _Dinosauria_ (extinct; dinosaurs).\r\n    _Crocodilia_--Crocodiles; alligators.\r\n    _Plesiosauria_ (extinct).\r\n    _Ichthyosauria_ (extinct; fish lizards).\r\n    _Pterosauria_ (extinct; pterodactyls).\r\n    _Pythonomorpha_ (extinct; mososaurs, etc.).\r\n    _Sauria_--Lizards; snakes.\r\n\r\nThis surprising diversity of groups, each so widely isolated, as is\r\nimplied by separation as subclasses--divisions of almost the highest\r\nrank--shows that the class developed in favorable circumstances that\r\nstimulated enterprise, so to speak, and resulted in rapid variation of\r\nhabits, terrestrial, aquatic, arboreal, and aerial, and consequently of\r\nadaptive structure. The fact that most of the subclasses are extinct\r\nalso shows us that the story of the Reptilia is mainly a tale of the\r\ndeparted glory recorded in the archives of the rocks; and we shall\r\nhardly be able to understand living reptiles properly without knowing\r\nsomething of their prehistoric development into the dominance to which\r\nthey rose in the Mesozoic era, which we call Age of Reptiles, and their\r\nsubsequent decadence.\r\n\r\nThe first subclass covers certain most ancient skeletons and parts\r\nof skeletons that naturalists are not yet agreed are true reptiles,\r\nsome considering them stegocephalian amphibians. Anyway, they\r\nindicate plainly that it was from that group of Amphibia that the\r\nvariety sprang that developed into what, in time, became the distinct\r\nreptilian type. The first distinct product of this departure from\r\nthe stegocephalian stock appears in the fossils of a division of\r\nthe second subclass, the Prosauria (_pro_, \"before\"; _saurus_, a\r\n\"lizard\"), named Rhynchocephalia (\"beakheads\"), which, although\r\nlizardlike in general form, retain many amphibian characteristics of\r\nstructure. Now the amazing and extremely interesting thing about this\r\nis that a representative of this earliest of true reptiles is still\r\nliving--probably the premier peer among all vertebrates, reckoned by\r\nlength of ancestry. This most primitive of reptiles, illustrating how\r\nhundreds of ancient species known to us only by a few bones must have\r\nappeared and acted in life, is the tuatara of New Zealand, catalogued\r\nin science as _Sphenodon punctatum_.\r\n\r\nIt has the shape and general appearance of a big lizard, dull in color\r\nand with a granulated rather than scaly hide, and an oddly shaped\r\nhead, toothless in the adult, when the jaws become somewhat like a\r\nhorny beak. Yet it is not a lizard any more than it is a crocodile or\r\na turtle, but combines features of all three in its anatomy. Hence it\r\nis what naturalists term a synthetic or generalized race (as is the\r\ncase with all very primitive creatures) out of which more and more\r\nspecialized groups and species may be, and are, developed, each sorting\r\nout and strengthening some particular characteristic of structure,\r\ncontinuously modified by adaptations to habits and environment until\r\na separate type results. The ribs, for example, in the tuatara are\r\nremarkable for the presence of hooklike processes that project backward\r\nfrom each rib over the next rib behind it; such processes occur\r\nelsewhere only in the crocodiles and the birds. Behind the breastbone\r\nare rodlike bones embedded in the muscles of the belly; they occur\r\nagain in the ancient fish lizards and modern crocodiles, and probably\r\ngave rise to the under shield of the turtles. And so on.\r\n\r\nThe tuatara is verging on extinction. It has nearly disappeared from\r\nthe mainland of New Zealand, but is now protected on some small\r\nadjacent islands where it dwells in burrows which it digs and then\r\nshares with petrels. During the greater part of the day the tuataras\r\nsleep; and are fond of lying in the water, being able to remain\r\nsubmerged for hours without breathing. They feed only upon other\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nThe third subclass (Theromorpha, \"beast-shaped\") comprises very ancient\r\nreptiles whose remains lie in the rocks of Permian and Triassic age,\r\nprincipally in South Africa, and exhibit a skull, and especially teeth,\r\nso much resembling those of carnivorous mammals (for instance, those of\r\na dog) that at first their true nature was mistaken. These creatures\r\nhave excited the most profound interest, not only because they present\r\nso many differences from the Prosauria, but also, and chiefly, because\r\nit is from their ranks that we are able to trace, with no small degree\r\nof certainty, the origin of the Mammalia.\r\n\r\n\r\n            THE SOURCES OF TORTOISE SHELL AND TERRAPIN STEW\r\n\r\nThe turtles and tortoises are of a very ancient group (Chelonia) and\r\none very distinct among reptiles, by reason of their armor. What is\r\nknown as tortoise shell is the series of horny plates, in some species\r\nof beautiful texture, in others thin and dull, or even leathery\r\nin character, that covers the underlying bones that form the real\r\nprotection to the animal's body. In embryo (unhatched) turtles the\r\nskeleton is much like the ordinary four-footed type, with the vertebræ\r\nseparate, a full series of ribs, and the limb bones in their proper\r\nplaces. As growth proceeds, however, changes occur rapidly, but least\r\nin the oceanic \"leathery\" turtle, in whose skin nodules of bone expand\r\nand join into a mosaic of plates covered with a thick, coriaceous\r\nhide. But this skin remains quite separate from the skeleton beneath,\r\nwhich fact places this animal in an order Athecæ (\"lacking a case\"),\r\nquite by itself. All other chelonians are classified in a second order\r\nThecophora (\"case-bearing\"), and in them the changes that go on in the\r\nskin to produce the turtle's shell are far more complete.\r\n\r\nIf you peel off the horny shields on the upper shell, or \"carapace,\"\r\nyou will find beneath them a central, lengthwise row of squarish plates\r\nof bone, on each side of these a row of similar plates, and outside of\r\nthese a marginal row of small plates--all knit together at the edges,\r\nthe zigzag lines of juncture, or \"sutures,\" being plainly visible.\r\n\r\nWhen we dissect a turtle we find no layer of skin or flesh beneath\r\nthese plates, but discover that they lie directly on the bones of\r\nthe skeleton and are a part of it. This is what has happened: The\r\nvertebræ have grown together, and the backbone is a tube upon which\r\nthe original nodules in the skin have become fixed, and have broadened\r\ninto the central line of plates. Those nodules that lay above the\r\nribs have become fused with them so that no trace of ribs is left,\r\nexcept where their heads have become fused with the backbone, and they\r\nhave broadened into the side rows of plates; and the marginal skin\r\nhas become transformed into the marginal plates. Similar alterations\r\nhave produced the under shell, or \"plastron,\" replacing the skin; and\r\nadaptive changes have altered the usual relations of the limb bones\r\nto the rest of the external skeleton. The carapace and plastron are\r\nusually connected by a \"bridge\" of bone.\r\n\r\nInto the space within this shell most tortoises may withdraw the head\r\nand tail which, like the feet, are covered with horny scales. The head\r\nhas good eyes, and a nose with a lively sense of smell, which the\r\ncreature utilizes in selecting its food; but its hearing appears to\r\nbe dull. The mouth has no teeth, but the lips are coated with horn,\r\nmaking a parrotlike beak that can inflict a severe bite. Horny spines\r\noften grow on the legs, or tail, or both, assisting in both defense and\r\noffense.\r\n\r\nThe chelonians are a very ancient race, and one that has changed\r\nremarkably little since its beginning. The great age accounts for the\r\nvery wide distribution of turtles closely related, and also for the\r\nfact that they inhabit land, fresh and salt water; those of the land\r\nbeing, no doubt, the oldest. All turtles lay eggs, the shell of which\r\nvaries, according to kind, from a parchmentlike envelope to a hard,\r\nshining shell; but the process of generation is slow and curiously\r\ncomplicated.\r\n\r\nThe respiration of the Chelonia is interesting. The lungs are spongy\r\nmasses, attached to the upper shell. As the rigid case does not permit\r\nof their expansion by breathing, the necessary vacuum is made partly\r\nby the neck and limbs, which act like pistons as they are drawn in and\r\nout, the air being swallowed or pumped into the lungs. Most chelonians\r\nmay exist for a very long time without breathing, and can stay for\r\nhours or even days under water. No animal, perhaps, is harder to kill;\r\nand all turtles have long lives, the giant turtles of the Galapagos and\r\ntheir kin living more than 100 years.\r\n\r\nThe list of Thecophora begins with the suborder Cryptodira, whose\r\nmembers have the carapace covered with horny shields, and consists\r\nof the family Chelydridæ, composed of our two snapping turtles, the\r\nfamiliar northern one, and the southern alligator snapper. They inhabit\r\nstagnant pools, especially deep channels in swamps and slow rivers such\r\nas the bayous of the lower Mississippi Valley, and often show only the\r\ntip of the nose as they prowl about close beneath the surface in search\r\nof prey--anything they can seize. They take the hook readily if baited\r\nwith fish or flesh, but stout tackle and a strong arm are needed to\r\nland one when full grown; and the act is dangerous to the catcher, for\r\nthey are the ugliest brutes in the country, and to be bitten by one\r\nis a very serious experience. Nevertheless, the young are caught for\r\nmarket in large numbers, for they are excellent food. One curious fact\r\nabout them is not generally known, namely, that when lying still, like\r\na piece of old log covered with mud and moss, they protrude a pair of\r\nwormlike filaments from the tip of the tongue, whose wavering attracts\r\nfishes to their doom. Louis Agassiz says of the great alligator snapper\r\nof the Southern States, which when walking on land carries its body\r\nhigh on the long legs, much like an alligator:\r\n\r\n\"They are as ferocious as the wildest beast of prey, but the slowness\r\nof their motions, their inability to repeat the attack immediately,\r\ntheir awkwardness in attempting to recover their balance when they have\r\nmissed their object, their haggard look, and the hideous appearance of\r\ntheir gaping mouth, constitute at such times a picture as ludicrous\r\nas it is fearful and revolting. Their strength is truly wonderful. I\r\nhave seen a large specimen bite off a piece of plank more than an inch\r\nthick.... Fishes, salamanders and young ducks are their ordinary prey.\r\nThey lay from twenty to forty or more round eggs, only about the size\r\nof a small walnut, in holes which they dig in sloping banks not far\r\nfrom the water.\"\r\n\r\nThese snapping turtles probably represent well the disposition and\r\nhabits of the extinct predatory reptiles; and give us a hint of why the\r\nrace succumbed to the more active and intelligent mammals that were\r\ngrowing up around them toward the close of the Mesozoic.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to the great family Testudinidæ, which is scattered over\r\nthe whole world except Australia, and contains almost all the ordinary\r\ntortoises, mud turtles and terrapins, some of which are entirely\r\naquatic, others amphibious, others wholly terrestrial. Among the most\r\ntypical and widely distributed are those of the genus Chrysemys, to\r\nwhich \"mud turtles\" belong. The commonest species in the Eastern\r\nStates is the painted turtle _Chrysemys picta_; in the West, _C.\r\nmarginata_. These and other species of North and South America are very\r\npretty when young, the ground color of the upper shields being green,\r\nvariegated with yellowish or blackish markings, often in delicate\r\npatterns. They are carnivorous, depend mainly on fish, but eat many\r\ninsects and their larvæ. In winter they hibernate in holes in a bank of\r\ntheir pond.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TERRAPIN\r\n  (_Malaclemys palustris_)\r\n  (After Babcock. Boston Society of Natural History)]\r\n\r\nTo the genus Clemmys is credited the \"sculptured\" wood tortoise, the\r\nkeeled plates of whose back are marked with fine concentric grooves\r\nand radiating black lines; and the equally common speckled one, black\r\nwith round, orange spots. Both spend long periods wandering in woods\r\nand fields in search of worms and insects. Closely related to them\r\nare the salt-marsh tortoises known as terrapins, which are so much of\r\na luxury in the eyes of those fond of good dinners that probably the\r\nfavorite one, the \"diamond back,\" would be extinct had not protective\r\nmeasures, and cultivation in captivity, saved the life of the species.\r\nSeveral other terrapins are to be found in the marshes of the Southern\r\nStates, but not in other countries. Another relative is the interesting\r\nlittle \"box tortoise,\" which is often kept as a pet, and will become\r\nvery tame; its highly convex shell is colored black and yellow, or\r\norange-brown, but no two are alike. The eyes of the male are red, those\r\nof the female yellow. It is naturally enough a \"box\" tortoise, for,\r\nby means of a flexible joint line across the plastron, the fore and\r\nhinder halves can be brought up to the ends of the carapace, shutting\r\nthe whole body inside a tight box that will defy all enemies not strong\r\nenough--as are wolves, bears, and big cats--to tear it to pieces. This\r\ntortoise is exclusively American. It has become, as a species, wholly\r\nterrestrial, so much so that, although it is fond of drinking often,\r\nif it falls into the water it will drown. It thus leads us to the true\r\nland tortoises that fill the remaining genera of this family.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOX TORTOISE\r\n  (_Cistuda carolina_)\r\n  (After Babcock. Boston Society of Natural History)]\r\n\r\nThe typical and most numerous of these belong to the genus Testudo,\r\nwith about forty species scattered over all warm or temperate parts of\r\nthe world except Australasia. Typically grazers and fruit eaters, they\r\noccasionally vary their diet with worms, snails, and insects. The eggs\r\nare hard-shelled, and the males are usually smaller than their mates.\r\nMost land tortoises hibernate in the ground during the cold half of\r\nthe year, or they æstivate during the hot and dry seasons when in the\r\ntropics, but this is not an invariable rule. Several species of these\r\nland tortoises are common and well known in Europe and also in India,\r\nand are often kept as pets. They show considerable intelligence, and\r\nare decidedly fond of listening to music. Our best known American\r\nrepresentative is the \"gopher\" (_Xerobates polyphemus_) of Florida,\r\nGeorgia, and Texas. This turtle is nearly a foot long, with a high,\r\nrounded shell, dull brown in color, and the forefeet covered with\r\nhornlike scales and some spines--an armature for digging. The deserts\r\nalong the Mexican border have several local species.\r\n\r\nIn this family belong the \"gigantic\" tortoises of the islands east of\r\nAfrica and west of South America, now all but extinct, save a few in\r\ncaptivity in zoölogical gardens. In fact they differ from ordinary land\r\ntortoises mainly in size and in such minor points as distinguish the\r\nvarious species; some of them, indeed, are not excessive in bulk. The\r\nlargest on record is a male of _T. daudini_, of South Aldabra, whose\r\nshell was sixty-seven inches long, and whose living weight was 500\r\npounds. A fossil species of the late Miocene in India had a shell six\r\nfeet long, and then and later tortoises almost as big inhabited both\r\nEurope and North America, and more recently Madagascar. Their survivors\r\nare now restricted to two widely separated regions--the Galapagos\r\nIslands, 600 miles off the coast of Ecuador, and the Mascarenes and\r\nother western islands in the Indian Ocean. The most interesting thing\r\nabout this matter is the presence of these tortoises on these widely\r\nscattered islands, and the effects of their isolation. It must be noted\r\nthat when discovered by European voyagers no one of these islands,\r\nexcept the Comoros, was inhabited by men, and none had any large or\r\nharmful beasts of prey.\r\n\r\nOn these peaceful islands plenty of food, an equable climate, and\r\nabsence of enemies, enabled the tortoises in vast numbers to grow to a\r\nsize impossible to their relatives on the mainlands. \"Scattered over\r\nthe many islands they were prevented from interbreeding, and thus it\r\nhas come to pass that not only every group of islands, but, in the case\r\nof the Galapagos, almost every island has, or had, its own particular\r\nkind.\" How did these huge chelonians get to these islands? None like\r\nthem is found on any continent at present, although they had a wide\r\ndistribution in geological ages. We must conclude that those of the\r\nMadagascar region, at least, are the descendants of tortoises once\r\npopulating \"Lemuria,\" that land area which until mid-Tertiary time\r\noccupied the region of the western Indian Ocean, and of which the\r\nexisting islands are the remains. A similar theory, for which there\r\nis geological evidence, may account for the survival of the Galapagos\r\ngiant tortoises after those of the mainland had died off.\r\n\r\nThe next family is that of the big sea turtles (Chelonidæ), such as the\r\ngreen turtle, whose flesh is so highly prized a substance for delicate\r\nsoups (but almost all turtle flesh is good eating), the hawksbill and\r\nthe loggerhead. They abound in all warm seas, and reach a large size,\r\nthe green turtle often having a shell three to four feet long, but\r\nsmooth, while that of the hawksbill is covered with horny plates with\r\nhigh keels and an overlapping arrangement, which are the tortoise shell\r\nof commerce. The green turtle is wholly vegetarian in diet, feeding on\r\nthe large seaweeds, while the others are carnivorous, devouring fishes,\r\nmollusks, etc. All three resort in summer to sandy beaches, dig holes,\r\nand bury a great quantity of eggs.\r\n\r\nThere remains a large group of fresh-water turtles, distinguished,\r\nin addition to other important structural peculiarities, by the fact\r\nthat they withdraw the head under the shell by a sidewise bending\r\nof the long neck. They are entirely carnivorous, and occur in all\r\ntropical and some temperate countries, the ferocious \"soft shells\"\r\nof the Mississippi Valley and northeastward belonging here. A very\r\ncurious one is the matamata of Guiana and northern Brazil, the biggest\r\nof its tribe, becoming more than three feet long. It gets its living\r\nby stratagem rather than by activity. The back of its shell is so\r\nroughened by coarse bosses that it looks like the bark on an old log,\r\nand ragged flaps of skin project from head and neck. These are kept in\r\nconstant motion, and attract the attention of passing fishes and other\r\ncreatures, whose curiosity often takes them too near the treacherous\r\njaws of the concealed monster.\r\n\r\nOur list of turtles ends with the one probably of most importance to\r\nmankind of all the kinds in the world. This is the \"arrau\" of the\r\nAmazon and Orinoco basins, where it is very abundant, and not only\r\nan essential element in the subsistence of the native Indians, but\r\nof great commercial importance on account of the eggs, which are\r\nperiodically collected in enormous quantities, chiefly for their oil.\r\nThis oil is eaten, like the eggs themselves, or is used for burning\r\nin lamps, or as an addition to tar. The turtles are likewise eaten by\r\nman and beast. This turtle is large, sometimes three feet long; and it\r\ndeposits a great number of soft-shelled eggs in the sand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HORNED DINOSAUR\r\n  (_Monoclonius nasicornus_)\r\n  Skeleton restored from bones found in the Red Deer River region,\r\n  Canada. (American Museum of Natural History)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                     DINOSAURS--ANCESTORS OF BIRDS\r\n\r\nNo class of the extinct reptiles is so familiar, by name at least, as\r\nis that of the dinosaurs, mainly because of the enormous size of some\r\nof them, and the fact that their prodigious skeletons are exhibited\r\ncomplete in many museums. No other land animals ever approached some\r\nof them in bulk. A great number of species have been exhumed, yet as\r\na group these reptiles are only imperfectly known, for the fossils\r\nare not scattered throughout the whole extent of Mesozoic deposits,\r\nbut only in two limited periods of that era separated by two or\r\nthree millions of years. All of them had short, compact bodies, long\r\ntails, and long legs for a reptile, and instead of crawling they\r\nwalked or ran, sometimes upon all fours, more generally on the hind\r\nlimbs, like ostriches. They ranged in size from that of a cat to the\r\nprodigious bulk of the diplodocus or the brontosaurus, seventy feet\r\nlong and perhaps twenty feet high at the hips, while an East African\r\nspecies appears to have been even far bigger. Some were herbivorous,\r\nand dwellers mainly in marshes and swamps; others ranged the uplands,\r\narmored for defense against huge predatory kinds, and still others had\r\nhorny beaks like birds. It is believed, in fact, that our birds are\r\ndescended from the same stock as these creatures, through an early\r\noffshoot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MONOCLONIUS RESTORATION (DECKERT) IN TYPICAL LANDSCAPE\r\n  (American Museum of Natural History)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                       CROCODILES AND ALLIGATORS\r\n\r\nThese repulsive and ferocious reptiles (Crocodilia) are the bulkiest\r\nof the whole class, and most resemble the ancient aquatic dinosaurs,\r\nwith which they are undoubtedly allied, although their precise\r\nderivation is undetermined. Their general shape is in conformity with\r\nthe reptilian model, rather than indicative of any close relationship\r\nto lizards; indeed their closest living relatives are the tuatara and\r\nthe chelonians. They have four legs of nearly equal size in modern\r\nexamples, but in some of the older extinct forms of the Lias and\r\nJurassic strata the hind legs were much longer than the fore pair, and\r\nbroadly webbed, while other features indicate a purely marine life;\r\nbut it appears plain that the crocodilians originated as land dwellers\r\nwhose descendants, early in the history of the group, took to an\r\namphibious method of life.\r\n\r\nThe eyes, nostrils, and external ears are situated on the upper surface\r\nof the head, so that breathing, seeing, and hearing are unimpaired in\r\nthe water, the upper part of the head being usually raised above the\r\nsurface when swimming. The nostrils and ears have valves which are shut\r\nwhen the animal is under water.\r\n\r\nCrocodiles and alligators are mainly carnivorous, feeding on mammals\r\nand waterfowl, for which they lie in wait close to the edge of the\r\nwater, sweeping them in by a blow of their tail, but the gavials\r\nfeed almost exclusively on fish. All are oviparous, laying oval,\r\nhard-shelled eggs.\r\n\r\nThe order is represented by a single family, Crocodilidæ, including\r\nsix genera scattered through the tropical and subtropical parts of\r\nthe globe in the strange fashion that characterizes many of the\r\nancient groups of which present species are mere relics. Thus the\r\nAmerican genus of alligators has also a species in China; and the Old\r\nWorld crocodiles are represented by a single, narrowly restricted\r\nspecies in the region of the Gulf of Mexico. Our common alligator (_A.\r\nmississippiensis_) inhabits the low coastal rivers and swamps from\r\nNorth Carolina to the Rio Grande, and remains abundant in the steaming\r\nbayous along the lower Mississippi, and in the swamps of Louisiana, but\r\nin Florida has been killed off, not only by the demand for its hide (as\r\nleather), but in a wanton way by tourists and sportsmen, until now its\r\nnumbers are greatly reduced. It would have become nearly extinct were\r\nnot its prolificness great, each female depositing thirty-five to forty\r\neggs in the layers of the cone-shaped heap of a nest she makes on the\r\nbank.\r\n\r\nYoung alligators feed mainly on fish, but the old ones take more and\r\nmore to getting birds and beasts for their dinner, stealing on them\r\nquietly as they swim, or when they approach the water to drink. The\r\nprey is dragged down and drowned. In the crocodilian throat the passage\r\nfor air from the nostrils reaches much farther back above the mouth\r\nthan in other animals, and the entrance of the windpipe may be closed\r\nby pressing together the base of the tongue and the soft palate,\r\nenabling the alligator to drown its prey without drowning itself. In\r\ntwo particulars our alligator is singular--its fear of man and its\r\nvoice. When surprised basking on shore, as it likes to do, it will\r\nrush with awkward haste for the water; and there will get away or out\r\nof sight whenever a man appears. Hence it is safe to bathe in waters\r\ninfested by alligators, which will retreat from the feared bather\r\nas far as possible. Nevertheless when an alligator is cornered it\r\ncan and will make a very dangerous fight with jaws and tail that are\r\ntruly formidable. But it rarely attacks unprovoked, except where a\r\nmother finds you tampering with her nest. As to its noise-making, the\r\nalligator is unique among reptiles in giving voice to a really loud\r\nnoise, or bellow, which may sometimes be heard for a mile or more. It\r\nvaries according to the size of the reptile from the gentle \"mooing\" of\r\na small one to a \"thundering and tremendous blast\" by a big male.\r\n\r\nIn the half-submerged morasses of Florida, from Lake Worth southward,\r\ndwells a true crocodile, closely allied to that of the Nile, and first\r\ndiscovered there by William T. Hornaday in 1875. It differs from the\r\nalligator in the pattern of scales, in the relative length and vertical\r\nflatness of the tail, and especially in having a long, pointed snout\r\ninstead of the broad, spade-shaped head of the alligator. Its general\r\nhabits present no novelty, but it is more agile and, in captivity, more\r\nvicious than its cousin, while showing a similar dread of man in its\r\nwild home. This crocodile is found from northeastern Mexico south to\r\nthe coast of Ecuador, especially in salt marshes.\r\n\r\nCentral and South America are the habitat of several species of\r\ncaymans, which differ from alligators mainly in their teeth and the\r\nfact that protective scales cover the belly; they are blackish in\r\ncolor, and vary in size and markings, the largest, known on the Amazon\r\nas the black cayman, or \"jacare usassu,\" growing to be twenty feet\r\nlong; but the Indians pay little attention to it.\r\n\r\nCrocodiles proper (genus Crocodilus) are distinguished by the fact that\r\nsome of their foremost teeth fit into a notch of the upper lip, and\r\nare therefore exposed, as is not the case with alligators or gavials.\r\nOne species lives in West Africa, another in India, another is wholly\r\nmarine in habits (as were some of its extinct progenitors) and ranges\r\nfrom eastern India and southern China to northern Australia, a fourth\r\nis Australian, and a fifth Central American; but the best known of all\r\nis the so-called Nilotic crocodile of the upper Nile and the rivers\r\nof east central Africa. Formerly it occupied the whole course of the\r\nNile, and was one of the sacred animals of the priestcraft of ancient\r\nEgypt. In Madagascar it is extraordinarily abundant, and has there the\r\npeculiar habit of digging long, ventilated burrows in the river bank,\r\nin which it lies, and where it stores its prey. Large old specimens\r\nmay become fifteen feet in length, and their life is probably very\r\nlong, for new teeth grow as fast as the old ones are lost, and when\r\nadult they have no known enemies except one another, but their eggs are\r\nsought for by several kinds of birds, lizards, and so forth, and the\r\nold ones devour many infants.\r\n\r\nCrocodiles abound in all the sluggish rivers and estuaries of central\r\nAfrica, and are more destructive of human life than even lions or\r\nleopards, and kill much game and many domestic animals. Lying in wait\r\nclose to the bank, they make a rush, seize by the nose or leg any\r\nanimal as it stoops to drink; or, stealing close to an antelope or goat\r\nstanding at the edge of the river, they will, with a sweep of the tail,\r\nknock it into the water, and grasping it with their jaws bear it down\r\nto a horrible death. The crocodile does not at once tear its victim to\r\npieces, as do the alligators, but pushes it into some hole in the bank\r\nto decompose before being consumed. Major J. Stevenson-Huntington says:\r\n\r\n\"At Sheshike, on the Zambezi, a paramount chief, who lived some forty\r\nyears ago, used to derive great amusement from watching slaves and\r\ncriminals being thrown to the crocodiles, his chair being brought\r\nto the river's bank in the cool of the afternoon that he might\r\nenjoy the spectacle in comfort. The crocodiles at this place never\r\nforgot those halcyon days, and, until very recently, it was almost\r\ncertain death for anyone to drink at the river, or attempt to draw\r\nwater, except within one of the protecting screens of logs which\r\nwere erected for the purpose.... On the other hand there are some\r\nlarge pans in Amatongaland, which, although full of the reptiles,\r\nare said to be quite safe to bathe in, attacks on human beings being\r\nunknown.... Always cunning and suspicious, the crocodile at times\r\nevinces considerable audacity in the pursuit of his prey. Natives are\r\noccasionally knocked off the gunwales of their canoes by a flick from\r\nthe tail. I recollect Major Gibbons, standing upright in the stern\r\nof our little aluminum steam launch on the Zambezi, with the tiller\r\nbetween his feet, nearly losing his balance through an attack of this\r\nkind. I have heard of a native, sleeping on a hot night in the doorway\r\nof a hut close to the river, being attacked and dragged in.\"\r\n\r\nDespite this frequent attack on large prey, fishes are the main\r\nreliance of the African crocodiles for subsistence.\r\n\r\nAs opposed to this terrifying record from eastern Africa, the\r\n\"long-snouted\" crocodile of the west coast rivers offers a mild\r\nreputation, since it is content with fish, frogs and water birds as\r\nfood, and fears men more than it is feared by them. The natives hunt it\r\nfor the sake of its flesh. Crocodile meat is considered good in all\r\nuncivilized parts of the world, but most white men dislike its musky\r\nflavor; the same may be said of the eggs of these reptiles.\r\n\r\nThe Orient possesses a variety of crocodiles, the best known of which\r\nare the marsh crocodile, a near relative of the African species, and\r\nthe gavial, placed in the genus Gavialis, and distinguished by its\r\nlong, slender snout and weak teeth. This gavial abounds in the Ganges\r\nand other rivers of northern India and Burma, where it is numerous,\r\nand frequently exceeds twenty feet in length. A second species is\r\nfound in the Malayan archipelago. It feeds almost exclusively on fish,\r\nand so rarely harms man or beast that it is regarded as harmless. The\r\nmarsh crocodile, or \"mugger,\" is also of great size, and inhabits the\r\nrivers and marshes of India, Ceylon, and the Malayan islands. It is\r\na fish eater and an arrant coward, feared by no one under ordinary\r\nconditions. It was, perhaps, originally, as a matter of gratitude for\r\nthis harmlessness, that the custom arose among the Hindus of venerating\r\nthis reptile. In some places, as notably near Karachi, large numbers of\r\nmuggers are kept captive in ponds, and attended by priests and devotees\r\nwho guard and feed them.\r\n\r\nA third species is the formidable \"estuarine\" crocodile, which\r\nfrequents the tidal portions of rivers from the Bay of Bengal to China\r\nand Australia. It exceeds all of its race in stature, usually exceeding\r\ntwenty feet long, and one old specimen on record was thirty-three feet\r\nfrom tip to tip. It is held in great fear by fishermen, for in many\r\ncases it develops man-eater proclivities, and has all the ferocity\r\nand resourcefulness of its Nilotic cousin. The salt-water habitat\r\nof this species recalls the fact that among the many kinds of fossil\r\ncrocodilians known, from the Lias onward, one was a purely marine form.\r\n\r\nThe crocodiles are followed in the classification of the reptiles by\r\nseveral extinct groups, known only as fossils of the Mesozoic Age.\r\nThe first of these is the subclass Plesiosauria, containing a series\r\nof predatory creatures characterized by very long necks, short tails,\r\nand feet that in the older forms indicate a terrestrial existence, but\r\nlater exhibit a progressive change to paddles, showing that finally\r\nthe plesiosaurs were wholly aquatic. This was accompanied by a steady\r\nincrease in size, until finally a length of at least forty-five feet\r\nwas reached--chiefly by extension of the neck--in the elasmosaurus of\r\nthe Cretaceous rocks of Kansas.\r\n\r\nAnother subclass, Ichthyosauria, restricted to the Mesozoic Age, were\r\nlarge, swimming, marine \"fish lizards\" with a somewhat whalelike form,\r\nthe front limbs transformed into paddles, and the snout in the form of\r\na long bill filled with sharp teeth. They lived on fishes, cuttlefish,\r\nmollusks, etc., and had the general habits of sharks. They died out\r\nearly in the Cretaceous epoch, and left no descendants.\r\n\r\nA third extinct subclass is that of the pterodactyls, or \"flying\r\ndragons\" (Pterosauria), which possessed the air throughout the Mesozoic\r\nAge, and filled the place of birds in the fauna of that period,\r\nalthough they had no relationship to the real birds that came later.\r\nSome were no larger than sparrows, but later ones spread their leathery\r\nwings twenty feet or more. The origin and real affinities of these\r\nwinged reptiles are unknown and they left no descendants.\r\n\r\nWe find in the Cretaceous formations skeletons of very long, slender\r\nmarine reptiles (Pythonomorpha) with a lizardlike head and all four\r\nlimbs in the form of paddles, of which the mososaurs are the best\r\nknown. These were the latest of the Mesozoic reptiles; and about the\r\ntime of their disappearance we begin to find the earliest fossil\r\nsuggestions of the subclass Sauria which contains our modern orders\r\nLacertilia, the lizards, and Ophidia, the serpents. Neither of these\r\nowe their ancestry to any of the fossil groups just mentioned, in spite\r\nof superficial resemblances, but \"their origin has probably to be\r\nlooked for among the Prosauria, of which Sphenodon (the tuatara, see\r\npage 183) is the only surviving member.\" They are also very distinct\r\nfrom crocodiles in structure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MESOZOIC FLYING REPTILE (PTERODACTYL)\r\n  (Restoration, after Owen)]\r\n\r\n\r\n            LIZARDS AND CHAMELEONS--TURNCOATS OF THE WOODS\r\n\r\nLizards (Lacertilia) are creatures of hot climates, and especially of\r\ndeserts, and they exhibit an almost endless variety of shape, size,\r\nstructure, and adaptations to their surroundings and a mode of life\r\nthat is primarily dictated by their food. The majority are terrestrial,\r\nbut some species are semiaquatic. There are climbing, swiftly running,\r\nand even flying forms, while others lead a subterranean life like\r\nearthworms. Most of them subsist on animal food, varying from tiny\r\ninsects and worms to birds and mammals, while others live upon a\r\nvegetable diet.\r\n\r\nLizards, like snakes, have a scaly skin covered with a thin, horny\r\npellicle which is shed from time to time, flaking off in pieces except\r\nin the wormlike species, where it is sloughed whole as by snakes. In\r\nmost lizards the scales are well developed, and \"shingle\" the back and\r\nsides of the body, but in some they are like little tubercles, giving a\r\ngranular appearance--a good example of which is the \"Gila monster\" of\r\nArizona. Lizards are, as a rule, adaptively colored according to their\r\nhabitat, so that browns and grays prevail in the sand-running species\r\nor those, like the monitors and iguanas, that are mostly aquatic; but\r\nbrilliant hues in varied, even fantastic, patterns adorn many of the\r\nsmall, agile, tropical kinds, whose safety lies in their swiftness\r\nof movement and cleverness in hiding. This is supplemented in most\r\nspecies by the capability of changing color, a faculty that is most\r\nserviceable in the chameleons, by rendering them more or less invisible\r\nto the hawks and other animals that try to catch and eat them. Some of\r\nthe more sluggish, earth-dwelling kinds are further protected by many\r\nspines sprouting from the skin, as is familiar in our western \"horned\r\ntoad,\" and in the fearsome-looking \"moloch\" of Australia; and the\r\niguanas are provided with an erectile spiny crest along the ridge of\r\ntheir backs, most notable in the basilisks.\r\n\r\nA strange characteristic of most lizards with slender tails is the\r\npower to part with them at a moment's notice. If an enemy seizes this\r\nappendage, which often is held temptingly aloft, it breaks off and its\r\nowner escapes before the would-be captor has had time to recover from\r\nhis surprise. Within a short time a new tail is developed, but it is\r\nnever so perfect as the original organ.\r\n\r\nMost lizards lay eggs, few in number, and with shells hard in some\r\nfamilies, parchmentlike in others, that are hidden in a hole in a dead\r\nstump or some similar place of concealment, and are left to be hatched\r\nby the warmth of the sun. Many lizards retain their eggs until nearly\r\nready to hatch, and so are practically viviparous. The embryos have an\r\n\"egg tooth,\" as do turtles and snakes.\r\n\r\nThe Lacertilia are naturally divisible into three sections, namely,\r\ngeckos, typical lizards, and chameleons.\r\n\r\nThe geckos are a large and ancient family represented in all\r\ntropical countries, and some species are common along both shores\r\nof the Mediterranean, but none reach the United States. They are\r\nsmall, plump, flat-headed, and mostly somber in color, but this is\r\nchangeable; the skin has a granular surface, but regular scales cover\r\nthe desert-dwelling species. One peculiarity of the group is the\r\nadaptation of the foot to the habit of climbing about rocks and trees.\r\nThe undersurface of the toes has a series of plates, which serve as\r\nadhesive pads wherewith the animal is enabled to climb not only trees\r\nand the smooth rocks, but a windowpane or to run along the ceiling with\r\nthe ease of a fly. Another peculiarity is the fact that the eyeball is\r\ncovered by a \"watch glass\" of transparent skin, under which the little\r\nanimal rolls its eyes and stares at you with vigilant interest. Geckos\r\nare nocturnal in habit, and as evening approaches come out from their\r\nretreats and become active in hunting for insects, and in avoiding the\r\nother lizards, snakes, and so forth, that would like to seize and eat\r\nthem; and it is then that are heard their low, two-syllabled, clucking\r\ncalls that give them the name \"gec-ko.\" These funny little lizards\r\nare utterly harmless, come into houses, and are easily tamed, yet are\r\nregarded in many countries with superstitious dread and that foolish\r\nfear of poison that is attached to most small lizards and newts. In the\r\nOrient several strangely modified forms exist.\r\n\r\nThe lizards proper (Lacertæ) number several hundred species classified\r\nin eighteen families, and differ vastly in size, shape, food, and place\r\nand manner of life. Some, like the degraded slowworms, are limbless,\r\nscaleless and in their serpentine form and underground life resemble\r\nworms more than anything else. Others, such as the \"flying dragons\" of\r\nMalayan forests, have developed great winglike expansions of the skin\r\non the sides, folded close to the body as they climb about the trees,\r\nbut capable of being spread as supports when they wish to take a long\r\ngliding leap to some distant perch; and an Australian species has\r\nsimilar skin expansions that can be raised into a broad ruff around the\r\nneck that gives the little animal a terrifying aspect. The many kinds\r\nthat live in deserts have the dull hue of the ground, or may bristle\r\nwith spines, of which the squat \"horned toad\" of California is an\r\nexcellent example; while those that scamper about the trees and rocks\r\nof the equatorial region are often brilliantly striped or spotted in\r\nreds, greens and blues. Many are pugnacious and able to bite severely,\r\nbut the only one whose bite is poisonous is the heloderma of the\r\nMexican border. This is a fat, sluggish, black and yellow creature,\r\nabout a foot in length, that inhabits the hot desert sands. Fortunately\r\nit is slow to anger, but when it does bite there flows into the wound\r\na poison which has the same effect as the venom of the rattlesnake,\r\nalthough less copious and virulent. Severe illness, and in a few cases\r\ndeath, have resulted from the bite of this ugly creature, which is more\r\ncommonly known as the \"Gila monster,\" because it is prevalent in the\r\nvalley of the Gila River in southern Arizona.\r\n\r\nAs the great family Agamidæ is confined to the Old World, so the\r\nIguanidæ belongs to America, where several species are numerous in the\r\ntropics, and reach a size of three to five feet, much of which is tail.\r\nThey live in trees, feed on vegetation, and haunt the banks of rivers\r\ninto which they jump on the slightest alarm. One traveler relates that\r\nalong the Mosquito Coast of Nicaragua, when a person is going in a\r\ncanoe up some of the narrow, unfrequented creeks, he encounters quite\r\na shower of iguanas, and runs some risk of getting his neck broken,\r\nfor a big iguana will weigh twenty-five pounds or more. Their flesh,\r\nresembling that of chicken, is a favorite article of food and iguanas\r\nare constantly brought to rural markets. The family contains about 300\r\nspecies. Among them is the common little \"chameleon\" (Anolis) of our\r\nGulf States, so often sold to tourists as a curiosity, and brought\r\nnorth to die of cold and neglect. It is golden green on the upper\r\nsurface, and white on the under, and the throat, when inflated, glows\r\nwith vermilion; it is a harmless, active little tree dweller, and will\r\nchange its colors to suit its surroundings with astonishing rapidity.\r\nIn another genus (Sceloporus) is placed the blue-tailed, variable,\r\n\"fence lizard,\" or \"swift,\" which is known throughout the eastern\r\nUnited States; but the common small lizards of the Pacific slope belong\r\nto Gherronotus and other genera.\r\n\r\nThe largest lizards of all belong to the two families Varanidæ, the\r\n\"monitors\" of Africa and eastward to Australia, and Teidæ, the \"tejus\"\r\nof Central and South America. They are singularly alike in appearance\r\nand habits--long-tailed, slender, smooth-skinned, carnivorous\r\ncreatures, living in all sorts of places, varying with the numerous\r\nspecies, and both hated and utilized by the natives of the various\r\ncountries they inhabit. Some monitors are more than seven feet long.\r\nThe American tejus, such as the big \"teguexin\" of Brazil, frequent\r\nforests and plantations, where their strength and speed enable them to\r\ncatch all kinds of animals, from insects to worms, frogs, snakes, mice,\r\nand birds. \"They take chickens and eggs from the farms, and they are\r\nfrequently hunted down by dogs for the sake of their flesh, which is\r\nconsidered good to eat. They defend themselves with lashing strokes of\r\ntheir long tail and with their powerful jaws.\"\r\n\r\nThe chameleons differ so much from other lizards that they have\r\nbeen placed by some systemists in a different suborder. The chief\r\ndifferences are three. First, the feet, terminating rather long legs,\r\nhave the fingers and toes so arranged that two digits oppose three\r\nas do our thumbs the palm of the hand, and the animal can grasp a\r\nbranch just as we would, giving so firm a grip that chameleons are\r\nexceedingly agile climbers, and may take as many odd attitudes among\r\nthe branches as would a monkey. Second, the eyes are very large, but\r\nthe eyelids have grown together over them, leaving only a small hole\r\nout of which to look. The right and left eye roll about incessantly,\r\nand independently, giving a most comical squinting effect--but no\r\nlizard sees with both eyes at once! Third, the tongue has reached an\r\nextraordinary development. When the mouth is shut it is withdrawn into\r\na tubular sheath at the back of the mouth; but when a fly is seen and\r\nwanted it is shot out like a released spring, seizes the fly in the\r\nflaps at its club-shaped extremity, and is quickly withdrawn. This\r\ntongue may be thrust out to a distance equal to the length of the body,\r\nless the long, tapering, prehensile tail, which is another important\r\npart of the equipment of these active tree dwellers. The skin is not\r\nscaly, but granular in appearance; and the skull is prolonged behind\r\ninto a pointed helmetlike form that is distinctive of the group.\r\n\r\nChameleons are most celebrated, however, for their remarkable power\r\nof changing their color, but this is by no means always, or perhaps\r\noften in direct response to the hue of their immediate surroundings.\r\nDr. Hans Gadow has made an extensive study of his captive specimens of\r\nthe common chameleon of the Mediterranean region, and confesses himself\r\nbaffled in the attempt to learn an explanation of the influences,\r\nexternal or mental, that causes the alterations of hue. One judges\r\nfrom his observations that they are mainly the expression of fleeting\r\nemotions--but who can read the emotions of a lizard?\r\n\r\nBut if we do not know the _why_, the _how_ of these fluctuations of\r\ncolor is well understood, and is briefly stated by Prof. Pycraft:\r\n\r\n\"The horny outermost layer of the skin is colorless; in the layer\r\nbeneath this are embedded iridescent cells with striated surfaces.\r\nBelow this, in the deepest layer of the skin, _cutis_, are a large\r\nnumber of cells filled with refractive granules, chiefly guanin\r\ncrystals. These cause white color by diffuse reflection of direct\r\nlight. Nearer the surface are cells filled with oil drops, and these\r\ngive a yellow color. In the granular mass are embedded numerous\r\ncolor-bearing granular sacs or chromatophores, containing for the most\r\npart blackish brown or reddish pigment. The branches of these sacs\r\nbeing contractile, the contained granules of color are drawn away\r\nfrom or toward the surface of the skin, and thus, combining with the\r\nstationary color, effect a corresponding change in the coloration of\r\nthe animal.\"\r\n\r\nThe chameleons are an African family, but a few of the fifty or so\r\nspecies belong also to the western coast of India and Ceylon, and one\r\nis a resident of southern Spain. They vary in size from that of a mouse\r\nto a species in Madagascar two feet long.\r\n\r\nThe lizards and snakes are the most recent developments of the\r\nreptilian line of vertebrate evolution. No undoubted lizard remains\r\nhave been discovered antedating the end of the Cretaceous epoch; and no\r\nfossil evidences of snakes are much older than the mid-Tertiary, yet\r\nthese are surprisingly similar to existing forms. The affinities of\r\nboth groups seem to be with Pythonomorpha.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n                        SERPENTS, GOOD AND BAD\r\n\r\n\r\nSnakes (Ophidia) are the newest and most flourishing branch on the\r\nreptilian family tree, whose trunk and lower limbs are dead or dying.\r\nThey differ from lizards mainly in their elongated and limbless form\r\n(which, however, had been foreshadowed by certain lizards) and more\r\nparticularly in the formation of the mouth. Instead of a solid union of\r\nthe bones of the skull, many of the bones, especially about the mouth,\r\nare connected by an elastic ligament, allowing the snakes to open their\r\nmouths widely enough to swallow larger prey than otherwise would be\r\npossible. The palatal bones, as well as the jaws, bear small, solid,\r\nrecurved and pointed teeth, replaced by others from the same root pulp\r\nwhen lost; they have little chewing power, but are useful to seize and\r\nhold food which is then slowly swallowed by the snake gradually working\r\nits jaws ahead and over the object, until the muscles of the throat can\r\ngrip it and slowly work it downward into the tubelike stomach. Serpents\r\nstrive to turn their prey and swallow it headfirst.\r\n\r\nThe tongue in all serpents is a slender, extensible organ, forked at\r\nthe tip, usually black, and always seen protruded and waving about when\r\na snake is disturbed. Uninformed people call it a \"stinger,\" but it is\r\nmerely the animal's tongue and used as such. It serves the additional\r\npurpose of an instrument of investigation, the serpent informing\r\nitself by touching with its tongue as to the nature of many things\r\nwith which it comes in contact. It has, however, no stinging or other\r\nharmful purpose or power whatever. A rattlesnake's tongue would harm\r\nyou no more than one of the little love licks that you get from your\r\nfavorite puppy.\r\n\r\nThe eyes, which may be rudimentary in the burrowing species, or large\r\nin those of nocturnal habits, have no eyelids, and are covered with\r\na transparent film of skin that is sloughed off whenever the skin is\r\nshed, which happens frequently in young, growing individuals, but only\r\nannually in adults, as a rule; and for a day or two snakes are blinded\r\nby the loosening of this covering. No snake has ear openings, and their\r\nhearing is dull. The sense of smell, however, is well developed, and\r\nit is probable that these animals obtain much food by its aid, even\r\nfollowing a trail by the nose.\r\n\r\nSerpents travel on their bellies, moving their bodies in lateral\r\nundulations, and often running with amazing swiftness. Every pair of\r\nribs is connected at their lower ends with one of the large abdominal\r\nscales, or \"scutes,\" and it is generally believed that the creature\r\nmoves by the pressure and pushing of these scutes and rib points on\r\nthe ground; but Boulenger, a leading authority, thinks that their\r\nimportance has been somewhat exaggerated, although of undoubted use for\r\nthe purpose of climbing, at which some species are remarkably adept.\r\n\r\nSome snakes lay eggs with a tough, parchmentlike shell; others retain\r\nthem within the body until the young are fully developed.\r\n\r\nSnakes do not migrate nor wander far from their birthplace in search of\r\nfood. Desert dwellers burrow under the sand for protection from the\r\nheat, and go abroad at night, as is the habit of many snakes. In the\r\ncolder climates the serpents hibernate, collecting in companies tangled\r\ntogether like a ball in some animal's burrow, or in a den among the\r\nrocks, the hardier ones occasionally appearing on warm days in winter.\r\nWhen they come out in spring they are likely to make their way to wet\r\nlowlands, in search of frogs, toads and mice.\r\n\r\nThe order is divided into nine families, which will now be considered\r\nin the order arranged by G. A. Boulenger of the Zoölogical Society\r\nof London. The first four families are small, wormlike, burrowing\r\ncreatures, with a large number of species distributed in warm countries\r\nthroughout the world, and regarded as relics of an ancient type. The\r\nbeautiful coral snake of South America, which grows to a yard in length\r\nand is only partly subterranean in habit, leads from these to the great\r\nfamily of boas and pythons (Boidæ) which contains the biggest serpents\r\nthat exist, or so far as we know, ever have existed. The members\r\nof this family have vestiges of pelvis and hind limbs, appearing\r\nexternally as clawlike spurs. The Boidæ comprise sixty or seventy\r\nspecies and the range of the family is world-wide. They mostly prefer\r\nwooded districts, climbing trees, assisted by the short and partly\r\nprehensile tail. Some are semiaquatic. All are rapacious, and feed by\r\npreference on warm-blooded creatures.\r\n\r\nThe family is divided into two subfamilies, Pythoninæ and Boinæ, but\r\nthe difference between them is confined mainly to certain bones in the\r\nskull. The pythons belong entirely to the tropics of the Old World,\r\nexcept a single species in southern Mexico; and number about twenty\r\nspecies. The Boinæ are chiefly American. None is venomous.\r\n\r\nA famous python is the six-foot, tree-dwelling carpet snake of\r\nAustralia, black, beautifully marked with a pattern of yellow dots.\r\nA very large species is the reticulated python of Indo-China and the\r\nMalayan region, having an arrangement of dark lozenges on a lighter\r\nground. India has a similar species, reaching a length of thirty\r\nfeet, marked with reddish brown patches on a yellowish ground. This\r\n(_Python molurus_) is the one most often seen in zoölogical collections\r\non account of its hardiness; but it is a savage creature, almost\r\nuntamable. Like others of these big serpents it is able to make very\r\nlong fasts; indeed their life, in this respect, seems to consist of\r\ngorges, followed by long periods--sometimes several months--of fasting\r\nand repose, entirely voluntary. It appears from observation of captive\r\nspecimens that they have individual preferences for a certain kind of\r\nfood, and perhaps wait for it; thus one in the Jardin des Plantes,\r\nParis, refused various toothsome animals for months until a goose was\r\noffered, which it seized hungrily, and then sulked through long weeks\r\nuntil another goose was given.\r\n\r\nAfrica has two pythons, one (_P. regius_) confined to West Africa, the\r\nother (_P. sebæ_), common from the Sudan to the Cape. \"The latter,\"\r\nWilliam C. Scully says, \"is the largest of African snakes, occasionally\r\nattaining a length of more than twenty feet, with a circumference of\r\neighteen inches. One is recorded of twenty-five feet. It principally\r\nfrequents rocky chasms in moist, warm forests. It is not dangerous to\r\nman, being quite nonvenomous, but it will fight fiercely if attacked,\r\nand the long, sharp, teeth may inflict a severe bite. The python\r\nusually preys upon small animals, such as minor antelopes, monkeys,\r\nconies, and birds. Sometimes this snake coils itself at the bottom of\r\na stream and lies with its nose just emerging. When a small buck comes\r\nto drink, the snake seizes it by the nose, the recurved teeth taking\r\nan inextricable grip. After the buck has been drowned the python coils\r\nitself around the body and crushes it for convenience in the process of\r\nswallowing.... The python does not regard the horns, which sometimes\r\nmay be seen sticking out through the abdomen. These wounds quickly\r\nheal, the snake apparently being none the worse for the perforations.\r\n\r\n\"So far as I know the python is the only snake which incubates its\r\neggs. Such, numbering from thirty to fifty at a brood, and weighing\r\nabout five and a half ounces each, are usually laid in a deep rock\r\ncrevice or in the deserted burrow of an ant bear or hyena. The mother\r\ncoils herself over and around them.\"\r\n\r\nLet us turn now to the boas. Popularly the whole tribe is frequently\r\nspoken of as \"boa constrictors,\" but that is the scientific name of\r\nonly one among several species, the _Boa constrictor_ of the West\r\nIndies and tropical South America. It is the one most common and best\r\nknown, and, as it is easily tamed, is the one often seen in the hands\r\nof performers with serpents in circuses, and exhibited in menageries.\r\nIn many places in South America the natives, according to Leo Miller,\r\nkeep them running at large about their huts to catch rats. In forested\r\nregions they spend most of their time in trees, but in an open country\r\nlie about on the ground, retreating when alarmed into some hole, as of\r\na viscacha--their favorite prey on the plains.\r\n\r\nFar greater and much more dreaded by the natives is the great water\r\nboa, or anaconda (_B. murinus_), of the Amazonian region, which is the\r\nlongest of American snakes, and the worst foe of such river-loving\r\ncreatures as capybaras and iguanas. The color scheme of the anaconda\r\nis greenish yellow above, with a single, or two alternating series,\r\nof large, blackish transverse spots, and one or two lateral series of\r\nblackish eyespots with white centers. The lower parts are whitish,\r\nspotted with black. The anaconda is very aquatic, and is usually found\r\nsubmerged close to the banks of the river, on the lookout for its prey.\r\nAlthough mammals and crocodiles are occasionally eaten by this snake,\r\nit prefers birds, these being constricted and eaten under water. Only\r\na single instance of an anaconda having attacked a man is on record.\r\nAlthough it grows to a length of over thirty feet, it is sexually\r\nmature when about half that length.\r\n\r\nVarious very slender and agile species, the tree boas, belong to\r\nthe tropical American forests, one of which is called the \"rainbow\"\r\nboa because of its marvelous iridescence in the sunlight. Another\r\nlarge species inhabits Central America and Mexico; and two small,\r\nbrown secretive snakes, the \"rubber\" boas, more commonly known as\r\n\"double-enders,\" because their blunt tails closely resemble their\r\nheads, are found in California and northward to British Columbia. The\r\nremainder of the family are scattered from Africa to the South Sea\r\nIslands.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      ORDINARY SNAKES (COLUBRIDÆ)\r\n\r\nWe now come to the family Colubridæ, which embraces nine-tenths of all\r\nthe modern serpents of the world. The more hardy species are to be\r\nfound north to about the summer isotherm of 41 degrees; and snakes are\r\nabsent only from some of the South Pacific Islands, New Zealand and\r\nIreland; Ireland never had any, despite the St. Patrick legend.\r\n\r\nThe best arrangement of the Colubridæ is that by Boulenger, who,\r\nadopting Duméril's terms, has divided them into three series according\r\nto the character of the teeth.\r\n\r\n   1. _Aglypha_--All the teeth solid and not grooved. Harmless, that is,\r\n   not venomous.\r\n\r\n   2. _Opisthoglypha_--One or more of the posterior maxillary teeth\r\n   grooved. Mostly poisonous; a few tropical species.\r\n\r\n   3. _Proteroglypha_--Anterior maxillary teeth grooved or tubular.\r\n   Deadly poisonous; cobras, coral snakes, etc.\r\n\r\nThe immense family Colubridæ is divided into several subfamilies,\r\nthe first and most extensive of which is the Colubrinæ, in which are\r\nassociated all the \"harmless\" snakes in the world except the boas\r\nand pythons. None exceeds twelve feet long, and most of them are\r\nmuch smaller. Nearly all lay eggs, but some bring forth large broods\r\nof living young, among which are our water snakes, and the striped\r\n\"garter\" and \"ribbon\" snakes so numerous in our meadows and gardens.\r\nThese striped snakes (Eutainia) exist in a great number of \"species\" or\r\nvarieties most confusingly varied in coloring, some having no stripes\r\nwhatever. They are very hardy, living far toward the north in Canada,\r\nand are the last to go into hibernation and the first to reappear in\r\nspring. For this winter sleep they burrow deeply into soft soil, or\r\nwhere rocky places exist, seek deep crevices.\r\n\r\nThe water snakes of the genus Tropidonotus follow, with many\r\nrepresentatives in all temperate countries, one of which is the\r\n\"common grass snake\" of England--the only serpent in Great Britain\r\nexcept the viper and a rare little burrower. Ten species, with several\r\nvarieties, are credited to the United States, some of which are ringed\r\nwith irregular or broken bands of blackish on gray, others obscurely\r\nblotched, and some black or brown with red bellies. They are the\r\nugliest of all our snakes both in appearance and in vicious temper;\r\nand are of no service to mankind, for their food consists entirely of\r\nfishes, frogs, toads, etc., obtained in or near the water. They live\r\naltogether in rivers, ponds and swamps; and by their dark bodies, flat\r\nheads, and keeled scales so resemble moccasins whose fierce, repellent\r\nattitudes they imitate, that in the South they are almost as much\r\nfeared; hence it is well to note the differences. The harmless water\r\nsnake is more slender than the deadly moccasin and may be told by the\r\nred spots on the abdomen; the undersurface of the poisonous snake is\r\nstraw color, with black or gray spots on younger individuals, but has\r\nno red spots. The water snake has the plates on the underside of the\r\ntail in two rows, the moccasin in a single row. These snakes are agile\r\nswimmers and are able to spend a long time in hiding under water. They\r\nproduce their young alive in broods of twenty-five to fifty, and they\r\nare as pugnacious as their elders.\r\n\r\nVarious small, ground-keeping snakes lead to another conspicuous\r\nAmerican group, the racers and black snakes of the genera Spilotes\r\nand Zamenis, of which species and near relatives are numerous in\r\nEurope and Asia, a Malayan example growing to a length of ten or more\r\nfeet--probably the longest of colubrines. Three different \"black\r\nsnakes\" are known among us. The largest is the \"gopher snake\" or\r\n\"indigo snake\" of the sandy parts of the southeastern States, which\r\nmay approach eight feet in length, and it is a variety of the still\r\nlarger yellow \"rat snake\" or \"cribo\" of the tropics, which is protected\r\nabout villages and houses as a good-natured exterminator of vermin.\r\nOur variety has a useful breadth of taste and lack of choler, and its\r\nhaste to escape into a gopher turtle's hole when a man appears gives\r\nit one of its names, while its glossy, blue-black color, relieved only\r\nby a reddish chin and throat, accounts for the other. They are real\r\npets, showing no fear and offering no harm; the closely related \"rat\r\nsnakes\" of India, on the other hand, although similarly protected as\r\nratters, are described as diabolical in temper, and thus usually remain\r\nuntamable. To some extent in the South, but principally in the Northern\r\nStates east of the plains, the commonest black snake is the \"black\r\nracer,\" which west of the Mississippi, instead of being pure satiny\r\nblack, with white chin and throat, appears in a bluish green hue,\r\noften with yellowish belly, and is known as \"blue racer.\" Third, we\r\nhave the less numerous and larger \"pilot,\" whose scales are noticeably\r\nkeeled and have each a touch of white. Raymond L. Ditmars takes great\r\npains to relieve these snakes of various calumnies, as that they hunt\r\nfor rattlesnakes and copperheads (whence the name \"pilot\"), as that\r\nthey \"constrict\" their prey, as that they \"fascinate\" anything, and as\r\nthat they maliciously attack human beings--on the contrary, they make\r\nfrantic efforts to get away the instant their fears are aroused, and\r\nfew things on earth can make better speed than this black rocket. If\r\ncornered, however, it will turn on the enemy, rear a third or more\r\nof its length, and strike repeatedly with a force and rapidity hard\r\nto avoid. Yet both the common and the indigo species quickly become\r\ndocile and show signs of recognition and partiality toward their human\r\nfriends. The long, slender \"coachwhip snake\" of the South and the\r\nequally thin and swift striped \"racer\" of the Pacific coast are allied\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nThe genus Coluber, to which belongs the famous Æsculap snake of central\r\nEurope, is represented among us by a series of large and gayly colored\r\nspecies. One is the yellowish, brown-blotched fox snake of the prairie\r\nStates, which is a ground keeper and a great hunter. In search of\r\nrats and mice it often haunts haystacks and barns where it should be\r\nwelcome. \"One snake is worth a dozen traps, for the reptile prowls into\r\nthe burrows and nests of rats and mice and eats the entire brood.\"\r\nSimilar in size (six feet) and habits is the brilliant red-and-crimson\r\ncorn snake of the Southern States, which is a great mouser and also\r\nan agile climber after nests of birds, whose eggs and young it likes.\r\nAnother, even larger, coluber of the South is the four-striped chicken\r\nsnake, useful in its pursuit of small rodents, but, like the pilot\r\nblack snake, with too great a fondness for hen's eggs and young poultry\r\nto be liked by farmers.\r\n\r\nThe big, gray, blustering \"bull snakes\" of the southern and western\r\nparts of the Union take their name from their habit of emitting a loud\r\nand prolonged hiss when annoyed. They keep on, and under, the ground\r\nin sandy regions, feed on small mammals and birds, and are powerful\r\nconstrictors; they are also noted for morose and savage dispositions.\r\nNext to these repulsive reptiles come in classification the beautiful\r\nand gentle green snakes--slender little creatures that hunt for\r\ncaterpillars and various insects through the foliage of bushes, among\r\nwhich their gracefully festooned length is hardly visible. South\r\nAmerica has another group of very long and slender insect eaters and\r\nnest robbers known as \"tree snakes,\" whose habits are similar but on a\r\nlarger scale, and which have a wonderful power of riding securely on\r\nthe branches, no matter how violently they are waved by the wind.\r\n\r\nPassing over a number of small, smooth-scaled serpents, of which\r\nthe pretty ringneck is an example, we come to the important genus\r\nOphiobolus, which contains the king snakes, milk or house snakes, coral\r\nsnakes and others, represented in the Old World by the genus Coronella.\r\nThey vary in size from fourteen inches to six feet, and in color from\r\ngray with dark blotches to a ringed pattern of red, black, and yellow,\r\noften of brilliant beauty; but there is much individual variation.\r\n\r\nThe king snake might easily furnish material for a long chapter. Its\r\nname follows from its known disposition to pick a quarrel and fight\r\nwith any serpent it meets, big or little; and quite independent of\r\nwhether it is hungry, for it is as fond of eating its own kind as it\r\nis of lizards, toads, mice, birds and anything else that comes in its\r\nway on the ground, for it is not much of a climber. Our books are full\r\nof incidents of its destruction of poisonous species, and the popular\r\nbelief is that it hunts for, and relentlessly pursues rattlesnakes,\r\ncopperheads, etc., but the authorities assure us this is not so.\r\nIf it accidentally encounters a rattler or moccasin, it kills, and\r\nperhaps eats it; but it does the same with any other serpent. It is an\r\nexceedingly quick and powerful constrictor, and careless of bites, for\r\nit is entirely immune to venom. Captive specimens have been repeatedly\r\nhypodermically injected with the poison of all sorts of American\r\nvenomous serpents, as well as bitten by them, and have shown little\r\nif any effect. But wounds enrage it. Winding its lithe body round and\r\nround the doomed creature, until every part of the shining length is\r\nengaged, it tightens with such strength that the victim is benumbed,\r\nunable to bite and quickly strangled. Nevertheless these snakes submit\r\neasily to confinement and speedily grow perfectly gentle and friendly.\r\n\r\nThe common northern representative of the genus is the house snake or\r\nmilk snake--names given to several other species; it is also known as\r\n\"checkered adder,\" because of the general resemblance of its blotched\r\nform to the dreaded copperhead. It is gray above, with a series of\r\nlarge, chestnut-brown saddles on the back, smaller blotches alternating\r\nwith them along the sides; the belly is white, marked boldly with\r\nsquare black blotches. The pattern and tints vary widely. This snake\r\nis a lover of warmth and a hunter of mice and rats, wild and domestic;\r\nand in search of them it frequents pastures and damp meadows, where\r\nsuch wild game abounds, comes much about stables and houses, and often\r\ncreeps into the rural dairies that are usually close to springs.\r\nSerpents with these inquisitive habits are familiar in all parts of\r\nthe world, and from time immemorial have been accused, among other\r\niniquities, of milking cows and goats, and of drinking and spoiling\r\nmilk and cream on the shelves in dairies and cellars. These beliefs\r\nsurvive among country people to this day, as I found out a few years\r\nago by an extensive correspondence of inquiry, in which incredibly\r\nabsurd statements were made. Of course, well-informed persons know\r\nbetter. The keepers of reptiles at the New York Zoölogical Park, for\r\nexample, find that snakes show no liking for milk. Captive specimens\r\ncannot be induced to drink it unless suffering from great thirst. It\r\nwould be a feat beyond physical possibility for a serpent the size\r\nof the largest milk snake to consume enough milk from a cow--if the\r\nreptile should be so inclined--to produce an effect noticeable to the\r\nmost minute degree.\r\n\r\nWe will mention only one other sort of our harmless colubrines--the\r\n\"hognose,\" \"puffing adder,\" \"spreading adder,\" as it is variously\r\nknown; but the name hognose is the best. Its genus is Heterodon. Two\r\nspecies are common all over the eastern half of the United States and\r\nCanada, one an ugly mottled gray, the other black. They are about\r\ntwo feet in length, thick-bodied, with roughly keeled scales, a flat\r\nhead and a pointed, upturned snout--altogether very unhandsome and\r\nforbidding-looking reptiles; and they profit by this in an attempt to\r\nfrighten away whatever alarms them, while in reality themselves almost\r\n(sometimes quite) paralyzed by fear.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 CORAL SNAKES, COBRAS, AND SEA SNAKES\r\n\r\nThe flattening of the head and neck practiced by the hognose as a\r\ngesture of readiness to fight, whether true or false in its implication\r\nof ability, is found among several non-poisonous colubrids elsewhere\r\nand indicates their approach in kinship to the \"hooded\" cobras that\r\nare the foremost representatives of the venom-bearing members of\r\nthe Colubridæ. It will be recalled that we have been sketching the\r\n\"harmless\" section (Aglypha), and have now to take up the two remaining\r\n\"dangerous\" sections of the Colubridæ, the Opisthoglypha and the\r\nProteroglypha.\r\n\r\nThe principal tooth-bearing bone in a serpent's mouth is the forward\r\nhalf of the upper jaw, termed the maxillary. The maxillary of each side\r\nis connected with its fellow by a small, single bone in front (the\r\npremaxillary) and otherwise is connected with the loosely connected\r\nbones of the skull by those elastic cartilages that enable the mouth to\r\nexpand and take in prey of a size more than equal to the snake's head\r\nwhen the mouth is shut. In the serpents that do not possess a poisoning\r\napparatus the teeth on the maxillaries are alike in size, and solid;\r\nbut in the venomous kinds some of the teeth are enlarged and grooved or\r\nchanneled to conduct a flow of poison into the wound made by biting.\r\nThis is the case with the poison-bearing sections of the Colubridæ\r\nmentioned above, and their difference is in the relative position of\r\nthe poison-conducting teeth or \"fangs\" on the maxillaries.\r\n\r\nIn the Opisthoglyphs these teeth are situated near the posterior end\r\nof the maxillary, and are grooved on the rear side, where they receive\r\nthe poisonous fluid from a sac in the cheek. The greater number of\r\nspecies of this group are residents of the Old World, although we have\r\nseveral representatives along our Mexican border, and more southward,\r\nespecially in the tropics. Most of them are little dangerous to\r\nmankind, as it is difficult for them to inflict a wound by \"striking.\"\r\nThey first seize their prey and then use their rather short fangs. The\r\npoison has a paralyzing effect, reducing the victim to helplessness.\r\nSome of these snakes must be regarded as decidedly dangerous, but\r\nfortunately all the American species may be quickly recognized by the\r\npeculiar marking on their heads, which has given the name \"jew's-harp\r\nsnake\" to a common species of Arizona. It is believed that the vipers\r\nare an offshoot of an opisthoglyph ancestry, in spite of the forward\r\nposition of their fangs.\r\n\r\nIn the Proteroglypha, on the contrary, the poisoning teeth, in all\r\ncases small, are situated near the front of the maxillaries, and they\r\nare much more dangerous reptiles, for they include the coral snakes and\r\ncobras (Elapinæ) and the sea snakes (Homalopsinæ), which are able to\r\nstrike their teeth into anything they successfully attack.\r\n\r\nThe coral snakes (genus Elaps) derive their name from the broad bands\r\nof coral-red that encircle their bodies in most species, with narrow\r\nrings of black and yellow between. These brilliant colors, combined\r\nwith the luster of the smooth scales, make them among the most\r\nbeautiful of serpents, and a common species of our Southern States is\r\ncalled the harlequin. The genus is exclusively American, and nearly\r\nall belong to the tropics, where the largest become five feet long,\r\nand their bite is deadly to man. They keep to the ground, and much of\r\nthe time under it, and are cannibalistic in their diet. The body is\r\nslender and cylindrical, the head small, and the eyes like beads. They\r\nare indocile, quick-tempered, and very dangerous to handle, despite\r\nthe fact that they do not always resist being disturbed. Hence the\r\nwidely prevalent opinion that they are harmless is a perilous delusion\r\nfostered by the fact that certain innocuous southern serpents closely\r\nmimic the coral snakes in size and colors. It should be learned and\r\nremembered, especially by visitors to winter resorts in Florida, that\r\nthe poisonous ones (Elaps) have the black rings bordered on each side\r\nby the yellow ones, while in the harmless species the yellow rings\r\nare bordered by the black; also, in the coral snakes the bands of\r\ncolor completely encircle the body, but do not in the other kind. A\r\nvery elaborate illustrated account of the coral snake and its poison\r\napparatus, methods and serious effects, was given by Stejneger in the\r\n\"Annual Report of the United States National Museum,\" for 1893, Part II.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the elapine serpents (about 125 species) belong to\r\nAfrica and the Orient. Typical of them are the cobras of the genus\r\nNaja, of which the species (_Naja tripudians_) met with from Turkestan\r\nto southern China and the Malay islands, and named by Portuguese\r\nexplorers \"cobra de capello\" (hooded snake), is world-famous. Several\r\nspecies inhabit Africa and differ little from the Indian cobras, but\r\nare equally deadly. The fangs in all this group are small and are fixed\r\nin the extreme front of the upper jaw, not being erectile like the long\r\nfangs of the rattlesnakes and vipers. Cobras vary much in coloration,\r\nand Mr. Scully reports that he has killed South African specimens of\r\nlight yellow, jet black and all intermediate hues.\r\n\r\nThe cobra is a fierce fighter and, when reared up, with expanded hood,\r\nlooks very formidable. Anterior to the head the ribs lengthen and\r\nthen gradually shorten to normal dimensions. These lengthened ribs,\r\nabout twenty in number, lie, when the snake is quiescent, more or less\r\nlaterally along the spine. But when the snake becomes excited, the\r\nneck bends and the ribs spring out at right angles. Over them the loose\r\nfolds of skin expand umbrella fashion. When much enraged, the cobra\r\nspits drops of venom at its enemy. These are propelled a distance of\r\nabout four feet.\r\n\r\nThe cobra is found all over South Africa, but is especially plentiful\r\nin the dry, sandy deserts northwest of the Cape. There extensive\r\ncolonies of large mice abound, patches of ground being thickly\r\nhoneycombed with burrows. In these the cobras dwell--apparently, as in\r\nthe case of the puff adders, on the best of terms with their hosts,\r\nupon whom they principally feed, reminding one of the tenancy by the\r\nWestern rattlesnake of prairie-dog \"towns.\"\r\n\r\nA close relative of the cobra is the ringhals (i. e., ringneck), known\r\nas the \"spitting snake,\" the explanation of which Mr. Scully furnishes\r\nfrom personal experience thus:\r\n\r\n\"The ringhals, when excited, exudes a quantity of venom, which drips\r\ndown the fangs and lodges behind the abrupt, horny, lower lip. Upon\r\nthis the angry snake directs a blast of air through its extensible\r\nwindpipe, with the effect that a jet of fine venom spray is emitted\r\ntoward an enemy. This jet may reach a height of six feet. That the eyes\r\nare aimed at I have proved by experiment. If the poison reaches them\r\nblindness, which may be permanent, results. The bite of the ringhals is\r\nhighly venomous, but the snake appears to prefer disabling its enemy by\r\nmeans of the spray of venom.\"\r\n\r\nThe most novel and interesting of Mr. Scully's contributions to\r\nAfrican herpetology, however, is his story of the mamba (_Dendraspis\r\nangusticeps_), which he calls \"the head of the family.\" It is the\r\nlongest venomous snake in the world, probably running to fifteen feet\r\nin exceptional cases, but is slender and primarily a tree snake. This\r\nnaturalist declares it to be the most dangerous of all snakes, as it\r\nis highly aggressive at times and its speed is quite extraordinary.\r\nIf disturbed during the pairing season, the mamba attacks without\r\nhesitation; and if at any time one happens to get between the mamba\r\nand its dwelling, the snake rushes straight for its objective and, in\r\npassing, strikes swift as lightning at the intruder. It progresses in\r\na series of bounds, suggestive of the successive uncoilings of a steel\r\nspring. There are two varieties, one colored a vivid grass-green, the\r\nother steely black, both so dreaded that the news that a large mamba\r\nhas been seen will cause the vicinity to be shunned--perhaps for months.\r\n\r\n\"The mamba has the habit of lying coiled among the branches adjacent to\r\na footpath in a forest. Woe to the passing wayfarer in such a case! If\r\nhe touch a twig, and thus impart the least tremor to the snake's lair,\r\na lightning-swift stroke upon face, neck, or arm seals his doom. Such\r\na stroke may be delivered either forward or sideways, with equal speed\r\nand effectiveness.\"\r\n\r\nThe most feared of the cobra tribe in India and eastward is the king\r\ncobra, or hamadryad, which often exceeds a dozen feet in length and\r\nis \"the largest, boldest and most dangerous of all venomous snakes,\"\r\nin Boulenger's opinion, \"for when disturbed it does not content\r\nitself with merely sitting up and expanding its hood, but will almost\r\ninvariably attack.\" Fortunately it is not numerous anywhere in its\r\nrange from the Himalayas to the Far East; and it is useful in that it\r\nfeeds exclusively on snakes, small pythons, kraits, rat snakes, and\r\nthe common cobra. Its bite will kill a man in an hour or two; and it is\r\nrecorded that an elephant bitten by one died in three hours.\r\n\r\nNearly all the serpents of Australia belong to Elapinæ, and are\r\nexceedingly dangerous. Among them are the \"black snakes,\" the females\r\nof which are called \"brown adders\"; the \"tiger,\" so called from\r\nits colors; and most dreaded of all, the \"death adder,\" which is\r\ndistinguished by a peculiar tail end, and by the fact that the head is\r\nmade distinct from the body by a narrow neck, giving it a viperlike\r\nappearance. When disturbed it flattens out the whole body.\r\n\r\nA few words about the sea snakes will close our account of the\r\npoison-bearing colubrids. These are set apart in the subfamily\r\nHomalopsinæ, on account of the structure of the tail, which is\r\nflattened vertically into a combination of swimming organ and rudder,\r\nfor they live in the estuaries of Oriental rivers, and go far out to\r\nsea in their search for food; and are to be met with from the Persian\r\nGulf to Polynesia and Japan. All are very poisonous, feed mainly\r\non fishes and produce living young; and all are clothed in varied\r\nand brilliant colors. Living in the sea, or in tidal inlets, their\r\nmovements in the clear blue water are agile and elegant; and in the Bay\r\nof Bengal they are sometimes seen congregating in large shoals.\r\n\r\nWe turn now to the last and most advanced family of serpents, the\r\nvipers, rattlesnakes, moccasins, copperheads, and so forth (Viperidæ).\r\n\r\n\r\n                  VIPERS, MOCCASINS AND RATTLESNAKES\r\n\r\n\"Viper\" is an old French-Latin word, meaning \"bearing living young,\"\r\nwhich was noted as distinctive from the egg-laying habit of other\r\nsnakes, and peculiar to the single species that the people of southern\r\nEurope knew--the small _Vipera verus_, or asp, from which the large\r\nand widespread family derives its name. The vipers differ from\r\nthe colubrids in important particulars. Their bodies are thick in\r\nproportion to their length, which rarely exceeds six feet, and this and\r\ntheir weight make them unable to run rapidly or (with one exception)\r\nto climb trees. The sturdy body narrows into a slender neck supporting\r\na distinct head, given a flattened, triangular form by the expansion\r\nof the hind head on each side to accommodate the great poison sacs\r\nwith which these snakes are provided. The maxillary is a stout bone\r\nin the fore part of the upper jaw, and carries on each side a long,\r\nbackward-curved fang, which is tubular and is connected at its root\r\nwith the extremity of a duct from the poison sac. When the serpent's\r\nmouth is closed, or it is swallowing anything, these fangs, which in\r\na large snake may be an inch and a half long, lie back in a fold of\r\nthe flesh out of the way; but when the mouth is widely opened they\r\nspring forward, and when the head is darted forward to strike a prey\r\nor an enemy, they are driven down into its flesh and the venom spurts\r\nthrough them into the wound, with benumbing and deadly effect. They are\r\nfrequently broken or dragged out, and then new ones arise from behind\r\nto replace them. The eye is large, dull, and catlike in its pupil; the\r\nscales are strongly keeled and dull in hue in the desert dwellers, but\r\noften gay with colors in intricate patterns in the forest dwellers;\r\nand the short and stumpy tail may end in \"rattles,\" or a horny tip, or\r\nneither. Nearly all give birth to large broods, which are as vicious\r\nat birth as are their mothers. The family has two sections, marked by\r\nthe absence in the first, and the presence in the second section, of a\r\ndeep pit in the broad scale on the head between the nostril and the eye.\r\n\r\nThe original little \"viper\" of Europe and Asia is more a nuisance than\r\na peril, for it is rarely more than a foot long, and its bite would be\r\nfatal only to a small child. A larger species, the sand viper, ranges\r\nfrom Italy to Armenia. India, Burma and Siam, however, have a member\r\nof this group which is pronounced by Sir J. Fayrer as next to the\r\ncobra the most dangerous serpent of the East--the daboia, or Russell's\r\nviper. It is nocturnal, not aggressive, and makes a loud hissing when\r\nanyone comes near it, so that it does not cause as many human deaths\r\nas it might; but frequently kills grazing cattle by biting them on the\r\nnose. The greatest and worst of these snakes belong to Africa, where\r\nthe northern deserts are infested with two greatly dreaded species--the\r\nhorned and the saw vipers. The former has two sharp hornlike\r\nprotuberances above the eyes, and Canon Tristram writes that its usual\r\nhabit is to coil itself on the sand, where it basks in the impress of\r\na camel's footmark, and thence suddenly to dart out on any passing\r\nanimal. Horses as well as men are in constant terror of it, for it will\r\nattack without any provocation.\r\n\r\nThe worst of the African vipers, nevertheless, is the puff adder, which\r\nranges over the whole continent, and may grow to a length of six feet,\r\nwith a girth equal to a man's thigh.\r\n\r\n\"The coloration of the puff adder,\" Mr. Scully writes, \"is in\r\ngroundwork a series of delicate browns, with more or less regular\r\ncurved transverse patches darkening to black and edged with vivid\r\nyellow. Its scales are keeled; its short tail tapers suddenly to a\r\npoint. It is a sluggish creature, incapable of swift progression. When\r\ndisturbed, it flattens itself to the ground, the air expressed in the\r\nprocess causing the warning hiss which has saved many a life. But if\r\nthe foot of the intruder touch it, or even tread in its immediate\r\nvicinity, the puff adder lunges either forward or sideways, with\r\na swiftness that the human eye cannot follow, and, having buried\r\nits fangs deep in the flesh, holds on like a bulldog, forcing two\r\nstreams of venom into the tissues. The expression of this snake--its\r\nsquare muzzle and glaring, lidless eyes with vertical pupils--the\r\nextraordinary gape of the jaws and the huge, erected fangs, form what\r\nis probably one of the most fiendishly menacing combinations in nature.\r\nNevertheless, apart from its head, the puff adder is a creature of\r\ngreat beauty. The 'night adder' (_Causus rhombeatus_) is much dreaded\r\non account of its habit of lying at night in pathways and failing to\r\nmove out of one's way. This snake is one of the exceptions to the\r\nrule of the viper class, in that it is not viviparous. It has another\r\nremarkable peculiarity: the poison glands, instead of lying compactly\r\nembedded in the maxillary muscles above the angle of the jaw, are much\r\nelongated, and lie one on each side of the spine.\"\r\n\r\nAll the pit vipers are American except a few species in southern Asia,\r\nsome of which are arboreal in habit and have red prehensile tails. Our\r\nAmerican species fall into two genera: Ancistrodon, the moccasins (no\r\nrattles), and Crotalus, the rattlesnakes.\r\n\r\nThe \"upland moccasin\" of the South is the \"pilot\" or \"copperhead\" of\r\nthe North, where it still exists in forested and rocky districts from\r\nConnecticut and the Great Lakes to Texas, and is particularly abundant\r\nin the rough hills beside the Hudson River, and thence southward along\r\nthe Alleghenies. Its general hue is yellowish brown, becoming chestnut\r\nor coppery red on the head and end of the tail, which terminates in a\r\nhard point. Along the back, meeting irregularly on the midline, are\r\nchestnut-hued blotches that divide on the sides, forming inverted Y's;\r\nthe belly is yellowish with distinct black blotches, leaving the throat\r\nclear. After one has seen a copperhead he is not likely to confuse\r\nit with the milk snake or any other. Its haunts and habits are much\r\nthe same as those of the eastern rattlesnakes, nor do I consider it\r\nany more aggressive in spite of a rather over-blackened reputation,\r\nnor so deadly in the effects of its weaker venom. It is bad enough,\r\nhowever, and should be killed on sight wherever children or pet dogs\r\nare likely to meet with it. This upland moccasin is named in science\r\n_Ancistrodon contortrix_; its brother species, the water moccasin, is\r\n_A. piscivorus_.\r\n\r\nThe moccasin is a larger, heavier snake than the copperhead, and a\r\ndweller in the sluggish rivers and swamps of the Gulf States and\r\nnorthward to North Carolina and Kentucky. The moccasins commonly lie\r\non the branches of bushes at the edge of the water; and if escape from\r\ndanger be possible they quickly drop into the water and swim away\r\nbeneath it to some hiding place. If suddenly surprised they coil and\r\nopen the mouth widely toward the intruder, showing its white interior\r\nthat has given them the name \"cotton mouth\" among the darkies, who\r\nfear them greatly, especially as they work in the rice fields. Mexico\r\nhas a similar species.\r\n\r\nClosely allied to the copperhead and moccasins are two very dreadful\r\nsnakes of the American tropics--the \"fer-de-lance\" of the French\r\nislands of the West Indies, and the \"bushmaster\" of Brazil. The former\r\nreaches a length of six feet, and the bushmaster, or surukuku, as the\r\nIndians name it, to twice that length, thus rivaling the great viper of\r\nIndia. Both have all the ferocity and power of their race exaggerated\r\nto the limit, and hundreds of human lives are sacrificed to them every\r\nyear. Every traveler has thrilling tales about them. Leo Miller, a\r\ncool-headed man of science, takes very seriously the fear this creature\r\ninspires. He reminds us that a bushmaster ten feet long has fangs an\r\ninch and a half long, and injects nearly a tablespoonful of poison at a\r\nsingle thrust. A man would survive such a dose but a few minutes. When\r\nonce a bushmaster fell from a tree branch into his canoe everybody in\r\nit sprang overboard, and some narrowly escaped drowning. Such deadly\r\ncreatures would make the tropical world unendurable were it not that\r\nmost of the time they are sluggish and peaceful; but a little fright,\r\nor a protective instinct in regard to their eggs, sets them off with\r\nthe suddenness of a released spring.\r\n\r\nIn taking up the rattlesnakes we have a sure guide in Dr. Leonhard\r\nStejneger's \"Report,\" describing all the species of North America (the\r\ngroup Crotalinæ is confined to this continent, Central America, and\r\na single species in South America). The special peculiarity of the\r\ngroup is the queer \"rattle\" (crotalus) at the end of the tail. This\r\nconsists of a series of loosely connected, somewhat cone-shaped, horny\r\ncapsules, each of which originally covered the terminal vertebra of\r\nthe tail. On sloughing the skin this covering remains, but is soon\r\npushed away by the new capsule formed beneath, and partly within it,\r\nwhich in turn is pushed out and replaced by a third, and so on, until\r\nsometimes a dozen remain linked together; and when the serpent vibrates\r\nits tail, as most snakes do when excited, they rattle against one\r\nanother, the tone of the \"music\" rising as the excitement, and speed\r\nof vibration, increases. The sloughing is irregular as to frequency,\r\nhowever, especially in young individuals, and may not always produce an\r\naddition to the rattle, and the appendage itself may be broken, so that\r\nthe number of pieces, or buttons, in the rattle is not a trustworthy\r\nmeasure of the age of the snake.\r\n\r\nThe smallest of the crotalids are the ground rattlers (genus\r\nSistrurus), of which we have two species, and there is one in Mexico.\r\nThe northern kind, widely known by its Indian name \"massasauga,\" ranges\r\nfrom eastern Pennsylvania and Ontario to northern Minnesota and Kansas,\r\nand thence to Texas. The Southern States have a second species commonly\r\ncalled \"ground rattler.\" Both are grayish brown with chestnut or darker\r\ndorsal blotches, and are inhabitants of the prairies, with their swamps\r\nand marshes. The largest do not exceed forty inches, and their bite is\r\ncorrespondingly weak in effect.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the rattlesnakes belong to the genus Crotalus.\r\n\r\nThe commonly seen species of the region east of the dry plains was\r\nnamed _Crotalus horridus_ by Linnæus, and this is one of the few\r\ninstances in which his name has defied change by the systemists. It\r\nformerly was to be found as far east as central Massachusetts, but\r\nthere, as elsewhere, civilization has killed it off, so that now it\r\nsurvives only in the Appalachian glens, and in thinly settled tracts\r\nfarther west and south. Its general color above is yellow-brown, below\r\nnearly white; and the body is banded with blackish, the bands taking a\r\nzigzag form behind the neck, and the tail is black. It rarely exceeds a\r\nyard in length, and is, as a rule, timid and nonaggressive; but a good\r\ndeal remains to be learned about its habits and breeding.\r\n\r\nFar more formidable than this is the diamond-back (_C. adamanteus_) of\r\nthe low, coastal region from North Carolina to the lower Mississippi\r\nRiver and throughout Florida, where it is far more common than is\r\ndesirable. This rattler may exceed eight feet in length, and has\r\ncorresponding power of harm. It is partial to the neighborhood of\r\nwater, where its ground-running prey is most numerous; hence it is\r\nfrequently spoken of as the \"water rattlesnake,\" to distinguish it\r\nfrom the banded species, or \"timber rattlesnake\" of the same region,\r\nwhich is more habituated to forested districts, with rocks. A race of\r\n_C. horridus_, usually large and vicious, exists in the coast swamps,\r\nand is locally called the \"canebrake rattler.\" The diamond back itself\r\ntakes its name from the lozenge-shaped patches of dark color formed on\r\nits upper surface by the crossing of diagonal narrow bands of bright\r\nyellow on a greenish gray ground. The literature relating to this\r\nterrifying snake would fill hundreds of pages. Raymond L. Ditmars of\r\nthe New York Zoölogical Park, gives this description:\r\n\r\n\"Most deadly of the North American poisonous snakes, and ranking in\r\nsize with the largest of the tropical venomous serpents of both the\r\nNew and the Old World, this huge rattlesnake, with its brilliant and\r\nsymmetrical markings, is a beautiful and terrible creature. Ever bold\r\nand alert, ever retaining its wild nature when captive, there is a\r\ncertain awe-inspiring grandeur about the coil of this formidable brute;\r\nthe glittering black eyes, the slowly waving tongue, and the incessant,\r\nrasping note of the rattle.... The mere vibration of a step throws the\r\ncreature upon guard. Taking a deep inhalation, the snake inflates the\r\nrough, scaly body, to the tune of a low, rushing sound of air. Shifting\r\nthe coils to uncover the rattle, this is 'sprung' with the abruptness\r\nof an electric bell. There is no hysterical striking, but careful\r\nwatching, and if the opportunity to effect a blow with the long fangs\r\nis presented, the result is generally mortal.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE RATTLESNAKE\r\n  (_Crotalus horridus_)\r\n  Beside the snake is the skin it has just discarded]\r\n\r\nA large and very showy western analogue of the diamond-back, known\r\nby the sinister specific name _atrox_, occurs from central Texas to\r\nCalifornia. One of its varieties is red, with darker red markings and\r\na white tail. The familiar rattlesnake of the plains east of the Rocky\r\nMountains is _Crotalus confluentus_, which is of moderate size and\r\ndull hue; its mainstay of food is found among the prairie-dog towns.\r\nA similar but smaller species (_C. oregonus_) takes its place west of\r\nthe Rockies, from British Columbia to southern California. The \"tiger\"\r\nrattlesnake, yellow barred with black; the \"horned\" rattler, which,\r\nlike the Egyptian horned viper, has a trick of advancing sidewise, and\r\nconsequently has the popular name \"sidewinder\"; and the slender green\r\nrattlesnake, are small species of the deserts along the Mexican border.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n                        BIRDS--KINGS OF THE AIR\r\n\r\n\r\nA bird is an animal clothed with feathers and having the forelimbs\r\nadapted to flight.\r\n\r\nThe birds constitute a class in the phylum Chordata, and otherwise are\r\ncombined, in the group Sauropsida, with the Reptilia, with which they\r\nagree more closely in anatomy than with any other group, one prominent\r\nparticular being that both have a single condyle, in contrast with the\r\nmammals and amphibians where the condyle is double. In fact primitive\r\nreptiles--probably of the stock of dinosaurs--are the ancestors of\r\nbirds, the divergence having occurred probably in Carboniferous time.\r\nOf the earliest divergent forms, the rocks have as yet yielded no\r\nspecimens, the most ancient bird forms recovered showing a degree of\r\ndevelopment in the new type that must have been preceded by a long\r\nhistory of evolution from its reptilian source.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARCHÆOPTERYX\r\n  Skeleton of Archæopteryx macrura with indication of feathers\r\n  (Reconstructed. After Andrea)]\r\n\r\nThe oldest fossil bird known is that named archæopteryx, whose remains\r\nare found in the Jurassic slates of Bavaria, which represent the\r\nbeginning of the Mesozoic or Age of Reptiles. In much of its anatomy,\r\nand in the possession of perfect feathers, it is a true bird, yet it\r\nretains many reptilian features. Its body was about the size of a small\r\ncrow; its legs were rather long, with well-developed feet of four\r\ntoes suitable to grasping a perch; its wings were short and probably\r\nfeeble, for the shoulder girdle and ribs are weak and the sternum is\r\nrudimentary. It is plain that it was arboreal in habits, but a poor\r\nflyer, and was aided in scrambling about the branches of trees on whose\r\nleaves and bark it may have fed, by the fact that three digits of the\r\nrather lizardlike wing hand terminated in strong claws, while the\r\nthumb was entirely free.\r\n\r\nThe practical value of this clawed hand is illustrated in a living\r\nbird--the hoatzin, of northern South America--which exhibits in several\r\nways the probable appearance and manners of the archæopteryx. \"It\r\nhaunts the sides of lagoons and rivers where a thick growth of low\r\ntrees projects over the stream or the mud left bare by the tide. When\r\ndisturbed the bird flies off awkwardly with a violent flapping motion,\r\nor leaps from bough to bough, erecting its crest and expanding its\r\nwings and tail. The note is sharp and shrill, and has been described\r\nas a hissing screech. The food consists of leaves and fruit. The\r\nconspicuous nest, placed on low trees or shrubs, is a loose platform of\r\nspiny sticks and twigs with a softer lining, and contains from three to\r\nfive yellowish eggs, spotted with reddish brown and lilac. The young,\r\nwhich can see and run as soon as they are hatched, have a claw on both\r\nforefinger and thumb, by means of which they creep about the thickets,\r\nand hook themselves over the branches, assisted by the bill and feet.\r\nThey can also swim and dive.\"\r\n\r\nThe most striking features of the archæopteryx were its head and\r\ntail. The skull is fairly avine, and the rather short and blunt bill\r\nwas furnished with conical teeth, nearly equal in size, and set in a\r\nmarginal row in distinct sockets. Still more lizardlike was the tail--a\r\nprolongation of the backbone nearly as long as the body, along each\r\nside of which sprouted strong feathers forming a horizontally flat tail\r\nwith a rounded end.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TOOTHED BIRD\r\n  (_Hesperornis regalis_)\r\n  Skeleton of toothed bird (After Marsh)]\r\n\r\nThe next that we know of bird evolution is derived from the discovery\r\nof the fossil remains of toothed birds in the Upper Cretaceous\r\nformations of Kansas--that is, in the more recent half of the Mesozoic\r\nAge. They differ greatly not only from archæopteryx but from each\r\nother, and are represented by several species. One type (Hesperornis)\r\nwas a wingless, diving bird of great size, whose long, heronlike\r\nbeak was studded with small, sharp teeth, all alike, implanted in a\r\ncontinuous groove; its legs were so hinged to the compressed pelvis\r\nthat they could be extended almost level with the back, and the lobed\r\ntoes thus became lateral winglike paddles of great power. The other\r\ntype, represented by Ichthyornis and its relatives, also had a long,\r\nstout bill set with teeth, but each in a separate socket. Ichthyornis\r\nwas about the size of a pigeon, and its strongly developed wing bones\r\nand deeply keeled sternum show that it was a bird of powerful flight,\r\nand apparently gull-like habits. So far as we know neither of these\r\nCretaceous birds had any progeny. When, after an immensely long period,\r\nother fossils come to light in rocks of the middle Tertiary period they\r\nbear few traces of ancestry, and exhibit little relation to the great\r\nmass of modern orders. They are the \"flightless birds,\" possessing no\r\nwings but running about on massive legs; and the group includes the\r\nextinct æpyornis, dinornis, and moa, and the existing ostriches, rheas,\r\nemus, cassowaries, and kiwis. Some ornithologists question whether this\r\n\"ratite\" group, characterized by having no \"keel\" on the sternum, did\r\nnot have an origin and line of descent quite distinct from those of\r\nboth the Cretaceous toothed birds and the modern \"carinate\" type which\r\npossess a medial crest or \"keel\" on the breastbone for the support of\r\nthe flight muscles; but the more general opinion is that they are a\r\nvariant from very early birds with wings.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          HOW A BIRD IS BUILT\r\n\r\nSince its feathers are the one thing that marks a bird, outwardly,\r\nas different from other classes of animals, we ought first of all to\r\nlearn what feathers are, and what purpose they serve. A quill feather,\r\nsuch as may be picked up in any farmyard, has a horny, hollow stem\r\nor \"shaft,\" which is bare at the closed large end or \"base,\" but has\r\ntwo soft, winglike expansions toward its tapering end that together\r\nmake its \"vane.\" This thin, flat vane consists of delicate branches,\r\n\"barbs,\" studded with tiny hooks, the \"barbules,\" holding each adjacent\r\nbranchlet in place, but letting the whole vane bend and spring. The\r\nwhole beautiful thing is really very strong and elastic, as it must be\r\nto push as hard against the air as a bird's wing has to do. The vanes\r\nvary much in shape, and in the degree to which the branchlets are\r\ndisconnected into a fluffy looseness. Ostrich plumes, and those of the\r\nbirds of paradise, owe their beauty to the fact that each branch in the\r\nvane is loose, and bears little disconnected branches of its own; and\r\nin many feathers no vane at all grows, so that they resemble hairs,\r\nwhen fine, and bristles when coarse, as is seen about the mouth of the\r\nwhippoorwill and some flycatchers. The nestling plumage or \"down\" is\r\nof this character. The lovely plumes of egrets are slender stems of\r\nfeathers having in place of a vane scattered soft hairs. In some sea\r\nbirds the feathers are so stiff and hard as to be almost like scales.\r\nThose of water birds, and especially the divers, are wonderfully close,\r\nthick, and greasy, so that the down that forms an undercoat for warmth,\r\nand the skin beneath it, never gets wet.\r\n\r\nFeathers, then, serve their wearers first of all as clothing--very\r\nthick and warm in birds of cold places; and doubtless this beneficial\r\nmodification of the primitive reptilian scale, by reason of its\r\nconserving the warmth of the body, and gradually increasing the\r\ntemperature of the blood, has been largely instrumental in enabling\r\nbirds to rise so far above the grade of their cold-blooded and sluggish\r\nancestors.\r\n\r\nMost animals whose lives are spent in the open air and light show more\r\nor less color in their coat, but none are more beautifully adorned than\r\nbirds. The most brilliant examples are to be found in the tropics, and\r\nsome of the gayest in our colder land, such as the tanagers and humming\r\nbirds, are strays from large tropical families noted for gaudy attire.\r\n\r\nThe color we see in plumage may be due to either of two conditions.\r\nIt may, as is usually the case, be simply coloring matter deposited\r\nin the substance of the feathers. But where the plumage gleams with\r\nchanging rainbow lights, as on the fiery throat patch of the humming\r\nbird, on the neck of a dove or on the purple-black coat of the grackle\r\n(crow blackbird), these splendid reflections are caused by very minute\r\nwrinkles on the feathers, that break up the light. It is the same\r\neffect, called \"iridescence,\" as is seen on the mother-of-pearl and on\r\na soap bubble. Blue is usually an effect produced by certain coloring\r\nmatter not blue underlying a thin covering of feather substance; and\r\nwhen you pound a blue feather into dust that dust will be black or\r\ngray--or, at any rate, not blue. Birds of the same group are colored\r\nmuch alike, as a rule.\r\n\r\nIn some cases the style of colors worn appears to be the best for the\r\nsafety of the birds of the group by making them hard to see as long\r\nas they keep still. Thus most birds whose lives are passed on or near\r\nthe ground, and which build their nests there, are dull in coloring;\r\nthey are in danger from more enemies than are tree-dwelling birds, and\r\nmust be able to hide better. No bird of nocturnal habits is brightly\r\ncolored. It is mostly among the small, quick-flying species, such as\r\nwarblers and finches, that we find the gayly dressed ones. They are\r\nbirds of the sunshine, and usually migratory. In most cases when birds\r\nhave a plain dress there is little difference in it between the male\r\nand the female; but whenever you find a species of bird wearing a gay,\r\nornamental dress, it is almost always the male that sports these fine\r\nfeathers, while the female and young are clothed in dull yellow, drab\r\nor brownish tints. This appears to be another measure of safety. The\r\nmales can wander about, look out for themselves, and take to flight\r\nwhen danger threatens; but their mates must sit quietly on their nests,\r\nand trust for safety for themselves and (what is really more important)\r\ntheir eggs or young mainly to not being seen. In their plain colors\r\nthey blend into the foliage and the shadows amid which they sit, and so\r\nare more likely to escape the sight of prowling foes.\r\n\r\nFeathers are not intended to remain permanently; they become worn and\r\nfaded, or are lost, so that at regular intervals the bird needs a new\r\nsuit of clothes. Twice a year, therefore, in spring and autumn, they\r\nare pushed out by new ones sprouting in the same feather-growing pits.\r\nThis shedding of the feathers is called \"molting,\" and it is analogous\r\nto the shedding of the outer, horny pellicle of its skin by a snake or\r\nlizard. Their molting is not very noticeable in land birds, because\r\nthe feathers drop out little by little; otherwise the poor creatures\r\nwould be left quite naked, and unable to fly. In most birds the new\r\nfeathers that come in are the same in pattern and color as those they\r\ndisplace, so that the new plumage differs little if any from season to\r\nseason; but some birds acquire a new coat for winter that is decidedly\r\ndifferent, and sometimes snowy white, making them inconspicuous amid\r\nthe snow.\r\n\r\nThe largest and most important feathers in a bird's outfit are those\r\nof the wings and tail, by means of which it flies and controls its\r\nprogress. How birds are able to keep themselves aloft in the air,\r\nand move through it at will, is not yet understood. That it requires\r\ngreat strength of wing muscles, and rigid support for them is evident.\r\nTherefore we find the head of the arm bone (humerus) fastened by stout\r\nligaments to a great shoulder blade sunk in the flesh beside the fore\r\npart of the spine, and also braced in two directions by other interior\r\nbones, one of which extends down to join its opposite fellow at the\r\nfront end of the breast bone, and form the \"wishbone\" (the united\r\ncoracoids). This solid bracing by bones and tying by ligaments gives\r\nthe needed firmness to the wings; and enables their powerful muscles to\r\nwork them.\r\n\r\nHow great these muscles are you will know when I tell you that the\r\nthick mass of \"white meat\" in the breast of the fowl carved at your\r\ntable consists only of the two principal muscles that move the wings\r\nwhen a downward stroke is made. They, in their turn, are attached at\r\nthe base to the broad surface of the breastbone, or \"sternum\" and its\r\nprojecting keel. Beyond the wrist joint stretches a large, misshapen\r\nhand, which consists mostly of one great forefinger, in the tough flesh\r\nof which the big quills, or outer flight feathers, called \"primaries,\"\r\nare rooted. Lying over their bases, when the wing is folded, is a row\r\nof somewhat smaller quill feathers called \"secondaries.\" Above those\r\nare the small and close \"wing coverts.\"\r\n\r\nThe tail is very important in guiding and checking a bird in flight,\r\nand is useful in various other ways, and may also be extremely\r\nornamental. The tail quills are always in pairs, making an even number\r\nof feathers. This results from the reduction to a mere stub of the\r\nlong clumsy tail worn by the archæopteryx and its fellows. The quills\r\ncontinued to grow in pairs out of the side of the tail as it diminished\r\nuntil all that there is room for (ten or twelve pairs) are now rooted\r\nside by side around the edge of the condensed coccygeal bones.\r\n\r\nBirds are, as a class, the most active of animals, and their\r\ntemperature is highest; this means a large consumption of oxygen, and\r\nthe windpipe is usually capacious, yet the lungs are not large, but\r\nare supplemented by another apparatus for aeration. Opening out of the\r\nlungs are several pairs of air sacs, amplest in those birds that are\r\nmuch on the wing, which not only occupy spaces between the muscles and\r\norgans within the chest, but in many cases extend into the neck and\r\nhead, and even into the limb bones, which in most birds are hollow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PELICAN, NOTABLE FOR ITS THROAT POUCH\r\n  Photo, Keystone View Co.]\r\n\r\nHere is a suitable place to say a few words about how a bird sings. The\r\nbreath enters and leaves the windpipe through the larynx in the back of\r\nthe mouth--an organ which, in our throats, contains the vocal cords and\r\nvoice-producing apparatus; but in birds the larynx is unimportant, for\r\ntheir voice organ is near the lower end of the windpipe, and is called\r\n\"syrinx\" or music box. It consists of an enlargement and modification\r\nof the bony rings about the windpipe at the point where it forks into\r\nthe two branches to the lungs; and incloses vibrating membranes. It is\r\nalso furnished with small muscles that act to expand or contract the\r\ntube and its inner fixtures, thus regulating the column of air forced\r\nthrough the syrinx when the bird calls or sings. These muscles thus\r\ncontrol the space and the shape of the opening, and the tension of\r\nthe membranes that serve as vocal cords. The muscles of the syrinx vary\r\ngreatly in number and efficiency among birds; and many kinds classed as\r\n\"singing birds\" (Oscines) do not sing melodiously or tunefully because\r\ntheir music box is imperfectly supplied with the proper muscles. They\r\nhave the instrument, but are unable to play upon it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PEACOCK WITH BRILLIANT TAIL SPREAD\r\n  Photo, Keystone View Co.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SACRED PHEASANT\r\n  Photo, A. N. Mirzaoff]\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe 10,000 or more different kinds of birds now living in the world are\r\nclassified in fifteen orders, of which the lowest in rank is that of\r\nthe ostriches, and allied ratite birds, mostly extinct, that stand in a\r\nplace apart by reason of their archaic structure and inability to fly.\r\nThe ostrich is still wild in the arid districts of Africa, Arabia, and\r\nMesopotamia; the rhea is Patagonian; the emus and cassowaries belong\r\nto Australia and New Guinea; the apteryx, or kiwi, still survives in\r\nNew Zealand; and several gigantic ratite birds have recently become\r\nextinct in New Zealand and in Madagascar, where egg shells, laid by the\r\nprehistoric æpyornis, that will hold two gallons are still found. Some\r\nspecies of these birds were seven feet in height.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n                       SOME NOTABLE WATER BIRDS\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom these relics of geologic antiquity the remainder of the birds now\r\nliving, and their fossil ancestors as well, differ fundamentally, and\r\nare united in a division whose badge is the keel on the sternum; hence\r\nthey are termed \"carinate\" birds (Carinatæ). The list begins with the\r\nmost archaic order, that of the loons, of which three or four species\r\nare named, but they are hardly separable. They are as big as geese,\r\nhave black backs checkered with white spots, white undersurfaces and\r\nheads purplish black, variously marked; and these heads and necks have\r\na very reptilian look, as they stretch forward their heads inquiringly,\r\nor utter the \"wild laughter\" that seems so consonant with the lonely\r\nwaters they frequent. The reptilian suggestion is even stronger\r\nin their cousins the grebes, known to gunners as \"die-dappers,\"\r\n\"hell-divers,\" etc., on account of the quickness with which they will\r\ndisappear when alarmed. The family badge is on the feet, where the\r\ntoes are not connected by a full web, as in loons, but every toe is\r\nmargined by a flange of firm skin with a scalloped margin. Grebes have\r\na way of swimming with the whole body under water, when the exposed\r\nhead and neck look very \"snaky.\" The brown and white plumage of grebes\r\nis exceedingly close and dense, and their indifference to wet and cold\r\nis shown by the fact that their nests are mere rafts of sodden weeds\r\noften so loosely tied to the rushes that they go adrift. Grebes abound\r\non all northern waters and are rarely shot since the taking of their\r\nsilvery breasts for hat ornaments has been stopped.\r\n\r\nThe penguins constitute an order limited in range to the antarctic\r\nregion. Their picture is in everybody's mind--a bird that stands as\r\nerect as a soldier on two almost invisible legs and a short stiff tail,\r\nand carries a small head, sometimes plumed, with a strong pointed bill.\r\nThe picture usually represents the great flocks that resort in the\r\nbrief summer to their rocky breeding places on icy shores, each female\r\nguarding and incubating her two eggs in the rudest of nests on the\r\nground. These antarctic \"rookeries\" sometimes hold tens of thousands.\r\nDuring the rest of the year the penguins are at sea, or under it,\r\nbehaving more like seals than birds, for their scalelike plumage is\r\nimpervious to water, and their stubby wings are in effect flippers by\r\nwhich they swim under water, the strong-webbed feet acting only as\r\nrudders until they come to the surface and can paddle. Penguins feed on\r\ncrustaceans and mollusks mostly, but also on fish and sea weed.\r\n\r\nNext comes that group of wide sea wanderers, the albatrosses and\r\npetrels, united in the family Procellariidæ, whose special mark is\r\nfound in the two bony tubes along the top of the beak that contain\r\nthe nostrils. Of the albatrosses many species are known, nearly all\r\ninhabitants of the southern oceans, although two or three of the\r\nlargest regularly visit the North Pacific coast, and more rarely one\r\nstrays into the North Atlantic; certain small species frequent the\r\nwestern coast of South America. The one best known is the \"wandering\"\r\nalbatross, whose wings spread nine or ten feet, yet are only nine\r\ninches wide. They spend their whole lives on the open ocean, and\r\nundoubtedly sleep there, regardless of storm or calm; but in summer\r\nland on some lone antarctic island or lofty shore, and construct a heap\r\nof mud and rubbish on top of which they deposit two chalky eggs.\r\n\r\nTheir relatives, the oceanic petrels, are much smaller as a rule,\r\nand some no bigger than sparrows. They are of many kinds, including\r\nfulmars, shearwaters, etc., and nearly all are black or sooty brown,\r\nusually with touches of white. Most of the group are denizens of the\r\nsouthern hemisphere, but some belong to the north and are migratory;\r\nand the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean are the home of the original\r\nstormy petrels, which sailors call \"Mother Carey's chickens\" and regard\r\nwith mingled superstition and affection; Leach's white-rumped petrel,\r\nof our New England coast, shares this name. Some of the far-southern\r\nspecies are almost as big as albatrosses. Petrels get their food from\r\nboth the waves and the shore and follow ships on long voyages in hope\r\nof scraps of flesh thrown overboard. Most of them breed in holes dug\r\nin the topsoil of sea-fronting cliffs, and lay white eggs; many hide\r\nin these holes by day, and go out only at night, filling the air with\r\nwild cries while they hunt; but fulmars and shearwaters, which make\r\nrude nests on rough shores or on cliff ledges, often in vast colonies,\r\ngo abroad in daylight, and throng on the Grand Banks and wherever else\r\nfishing is going on.\r\n\r\nNext, in the classification based on structure rather than on\r\nsuperficial resemblances, comes a large assemblage of water birds,\r\nsome exclusively marine, others of inland waters. Here are placed\r\nthose long-winged, graceful, oceanic flyers, the tropic birds, and the\r\nmany kinds of gannets, snowy white, that soar and plunge like falcons\r\nas they sweep over the waves and pick up incautious squids, fishes,\r\netc. Most of them are tropical, but one gannet is well known on both\r\nshores of the North Atlantic where it nests in thousands on the cliff\r\nfaces that bound such lofty islets as the Bass Rock near Edinburgh, the\r\nHebrides, and Bird Rock in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The flight is easy\r\nand powerful, and the food is caught by a hawklike plunge.\r\n\r\nThe nearest relatives of these white birds are the cormorants, which\r\nare shining black, glossy, with blue or green reflections. They are\r\nscattered over the whole globe, most of them along seashores, but many\r\nbreed on inland lakes and swamps, usually in large companies. Unlike\r\nthe sweeping and beautiful flight of the far-wandering gannets, these\r\nbirds appear heavy on the wing; and instead of snatching their food\r\nfrom the surface they dive after the fishes on which they feed, and\r\npursue their slippery prey under water, swimming with both wings and\r\nfeet, and dodging here and there in a most surprising way. Their bills\r\nare peculiarly well adapted to holding what they catch; and a near\r\nrelative of the West Indies and southward often spears its prey with\r\nits bill. This is the darter or snakebird, so called because its long\r\nneck and small head give it a peculiarly snakelike appearance as it\r\nswims with nothing above the surface but the slender head, and that\r\nmaking scarcely a ripple.\r\n\r\nFar more of a wanderer is the tropical long-tailed, long-winged, black\r\nfrigate bird, which is the hawk of the sea, for it hovers about the\r\nflocks of fishing birds and forces them to disgorge their catch, which\r\nit appropriates as it falls. Among the birds that suffer most from its\r\nrobberies are the pelicans, several species of which live close to salt\r\nwater in various parts of the world, while others prefer the lakes and\r\nswamps inland. We have two common species in the United States, the\r\nwhite pelican, seen all over the interior of the country in summer,\r\nand the brown, which is southern and maritime; both are gregarious not\r\nonly in their annual migrations but in their breeding, building nests\r\non bushes in large companies. Their food is mainly fish, caught both by\r\ndiving and by scooping them up as they swim. The well-known peculiarity\r\nof the pelican is the bag of naked skin that hangs from the underside\r\nof the bill, and serves as a receptacle for the catch; when it is\r\nfilled the bird returns to its resting place to consume its food at\r\nleisure, or to open wide its mouth and allow its nestlings to pick out\r\nthe contents of the bag.\r\n\r\nAll the foregoing are mainly marine and have short legs and webbed\r\nfeet, used principally in swimming; but we now come to the fresh-water\r\n\"waders\"--the herons, bitterns, storks, ibises, and the like, whose\r\nbodies are perched on stiltlike legs, and whose habits require them\r\nto wade about in marshes and swamps in search of their miscellaneous\r\nfood; hence the neck also is long and the bill straight and sharp-edged\r\nto fit it for seizing and holding the active prey by a sudden thrust.\r\nAll warm and temperate countries possess herons in a great variety of\r\nspecies, varying in size from a bird three and one-half feet long, such\r\nas our great blue heron, to one a few inches only in length; but the\r\ncolors are usually light and prevailingly bluish or greenish; while the\r\nmarsh-loving bitterns are streaked brown. Some are pure white, as is\r\nour elegant egret, which has been all but exterminated in the United\r\nStates by men who kill it in the breeding season, when the beautiful\r\nplumes that then adorn its back are at their best, and are marketable\r\nas ornaments for hats and military shakos. Every plume bird so killed\r\nmeans the loss of a family of young. Herons are shy, solitary birds, as\r\na rule, nesting on trees in remote swamps in \"rookeries\" to which they\r\nreturn year after year from their winter retreats in the tropics; and\r\nthey get their food, which includes every sort of living thing they can\r\nfind, mostly by standing motionless in the water until it comes near\r\nenough to be picked up by a swift stroke.\r\n\r\nThe storks are similar birds, but with rather heavier bodies and a way\r\nof standing erect, and of holding the head straight out in flight (the\r\nherons draw it back by curving the neck), which distinguishes them.\r\nThey are white and black as a rule, and mainly Oriental or African,\r\nno typical species occurring in the United States. Storks are more\r\ninclined to search the land for food than are the herons, and an\r\nEgyptian species is locally called \"a bird of blessing,\" because it\r\ncleans the villages, while the stately \"adjutant\" of India is carefully\r\nprotected as a similar scavenger. The most familiar of the storks,\r\nhowever, is the white one that in Europe nests on the roofs of houses,\r\nchimney tops and similar places, and is generally regarded with an\r\naffection that has been expressed in many a poem and story. Ibises are\r\nmuch like storks, the common \"sacred\" ibis of Egypt probably owing\r\nits religious distinction to its fondness for lizards and snakes--a\r\nservice highly appreciated in that country. Several ibises inhabit\r\nAmerica, one of which is not uncommon along the border of the Gulf of\r\nMexico, while another is noted for the splendid scarlet of its plumage.\r\nIn the same family is the beautiful spoonbill of our Gulf Coast, whose\r\nname refers to the spatulate expansion of the end of the beak. Its\r\nrichly roseate hue is reproduced in the dress of the flamingos, that\r\nneed not be described.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLAMINGOS\r\n  (_Phoenicopterus ruber_)]\r\n\r\nWe pass from the flamingos to the ducks by an intermediate form--the\r\ncurious chahas and horned screamers of northern South America--large,\r\nturkeylike birds, often tamed and made of service on country places,\r\nwhere they guard the poultry against hawks and other enemies.\r\n\r\nThe ducks are a cosmopolitan family (Anatidæ) of about 200 species,\r\ndivisible into five groups, namely, mergansers, river ducks, marine\r\nducks, geese and swans. These have many features in common, one of\r\nwhich is that in the early autumnal molt all the wing quills drop\r\nout at once, so that for a time none of them is able to fly. The\r\nmergansers, sheldrakes, or \"saw bills,\" are fish eaters, catching their\r\nprey under water, where they move expertly, by means of the narrow,\r\ntooth-studded bill that reminds us of the ichthyornis. They frequent\r\nrivers, and most of them prefer rushing streams. Of our three species\r\ntwo breed only in the Far North, the third on the Pacific slope. During\r\nthe winter they resort to a marine life in warmer latitudes. The river\r\nducks (Anatinæ) are distinguished from the seafaring ducks (Fuligalinæ)\r\nnot only by their preference for inland lakes and marshes, but by the\r\nfact the hind toe bears no lobe, while in the sea ducks it is somewhat\r\nwebbed and functional. This group includes such well-known species as\r\nthe mallard, black duck, gadwall, widgeon, baldpate, teals, shoveler,\r\npintail, and the exquisite wood duck, to speak of American species\r\nalone. The mallard and wood duck breed all over the continent, the\r\nlatter having the peculiarity of making its nest in trees, but the\r\nothers rarely nest south of Canada, except among the mountains of the\r\nPacific slope.\r\n\r\nThe seafaring ducks in North America also include several species that\r\nare found on inland bays and salt marshes, such as Chesapeake Bay and\r\nits borders, and do not limit their migratory routes to the seacoast,\r\nbut fly overland. Such are the redhead and canvasback, the scaups and\r\ngolden-eyes and the ringneck; but the eiders, the scoters, and some\r\nothers are truly oceanic. Most of these breed in the Far North, always\r\nnesting on the ground, as is the rule of the whole family, except the\r\ngolden-eyes, which choose hollows in stumps and trees. None of the\r\nducks lays spotted eggs.\r\n\r\nWhile among the ducks the male is likely to wear, at least in the\r\nbreeding season, more gayly colored plumage than the female--often\r\nof extraordinary beauty--among the geese both sexes are alike, and\r\neither white throughout, as in most of our species, or brown or gray,\r\nwith more or less black, as in the brants, and in our common \"wild\" or\r\nCanada goose. Geese are far more terrestrial than ducks and visit the\r\nland to nip the herbage, young corn, or cereals; in California doing\r\nserious damage to growing crops. All our species breed in arctic lands\r\nexcept the Canada goose, which still makes its nest in the northern\r\nparts of the United States and throughout Canada; and most of them\r\nspend the winter south of our country. They represent to most persons\r\nthe idea of bird migration. \"We see the living wedge of long-necked\r\nbirds,\" says Chapman, \"passing high overhead; the unbroken sound waves\r\nbring the sonorous 'honks' with unexpected distinctness to our ears;\r\nand we receive an impressive lesson in the migration of birds. They are\r\nembarked on a journey of several thousand miles, but they come and go\r\nas surely as though they carried chart and compass.\"\r\n\r\nAs these geese are larger than the ducks, so the swans surpass the\r\ngeese in size and are indeed the largest of water birds. The eight\r\nspecies are distributed all over the world, everywhere frequenting\r\nfresh waters alone; and all are white except a black-headed Argentine\r\nspecies, and the wholly black swan of Australia. Before the discovery\r\nof this Australian curiosity a black swan was the proverbial _rara\r\navis_--something incredible! Swans live mainly on weeds and roots\r\npulled up from the bottom, but also eat snails, and so forth. Two\r\nspecies, the whistling and the trumpeter swans, belong to the American\r\nfauna, but both are now rare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n                   VULTURES, FALCONS AND GAME BIRDS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe so-called \"birds of prey\" include three quite distinct groups, the\r\nAmerican \"vultures,\" the hawk and eagle tribe, and the fish hawks.\r\nAll agree in having strong, hook-pointed beaks, in many cases with a\r\ntoothlike point on the cutting edge of the upper mandible, and covered\r\nat the base by a fleshy \"cere\"; and in having claws of great strength\r\ntermed \"talons.\" This catlike armament, adapted to seizing and holding\r\nliving prey, and tearing its flesh, indicates the predacious nature and\r\npractice of the tribe, but it is developed to its fullest extent only\r\nin the falcons and powerful eagles, since a large part of the order are\r\ncarrion-feeders or catch nothing larger than grasshoppers. Among the\r\ncarrion-feeders are the condor of the Andes, and his almost extinct\r\ncousin the California condor, which are the largest flying birds in the\r\nworld. Near relative to them are the turkey buzzard and carrion crow\r\nof our Southern States, besides some tropical species. The vultures\r\nof the Old World are, as a rule, big birds inhabiting mountainous\r\nand desert places, and capable of overcoming almost any disabled or\r\nweak animal. A small one that in North Africa plays the rôle of town\r\nscavenger, as does our turkey buzzard, is famous under the Egyptian\r\nname of \"Pharaoh's chicken.\" The partial nakedness of the head, often\r\naccompanied by a great neck-ruff, is a characteristic of all these\r\nbirds.\r\n\r\nThe lammergeier of the Alps and eastward to India connects in its\r\nstructure and habits the vultures (Vulturidæ) with the real predatory\r\nfamily (Falconidæ), in which are placed the hundreds of species of\r\nbuzzards, harriers, hawks, eagles and sea eagles, that subsist by\r\nkilling and eating every kind of creature that it is within the power\r\nof each one to overcome. The bulk of their prey consists of small\r\nrodents; and in pursuing them they rid the land of vast numbers of\r\nlittle gnawers most injurious to agriculture; it should be the business\r\nof every farmer and orchardist to learn to recognize the three or four\r\nfierce little poultry-catching falcons in his locality, and refrain\r\nfrom killing any other sort of hawk.\r\n\r\nIt is a hopeless task to give any detailed description of the game\r\nbirds, which are world-wide in their distribution and practically of\r\nthe greatest importance to mankind, for in this group are found the\r\noriginals of our domestic poultry (the jungle fowls of India), and the\r\nquails, partridges, grouse, pheasants, turkeys, curassows, and many\r\nmore of hardly more interest to the naturalist than to the sportsman.\r\nThe sportsman is willing to count the toothsome rails as \"game\" when\r\nhe goes after them in the marshes of the middle coastal States. They\r\nare plain-colored birds that run about amid the salt grass and reeds,\r\nand are an interesting example of adaptation to this special station\r\nin life, for their bodies are notably compressed, so that a rail can\r\nslip through a narrower space than any other bird of its size; hence\r\nthe proverb: \"Thin as a rail.\" A common species in Europe is known in\r\nliterature as \"corn crake\"; and American relatives, the gallinules of\r\nfresh-water marshes, go by the name of \"mud hens.\" The rails belong to\r\nthe crane family, which includes many large tropical birds besides our\r\nown two kinds of cranes, both becoming rare in the United States.\r\n\r\nGood sport and delicate fare are afforded also by the great tribe of\r\n\"shore birds\"--plovers, yellowlegs, curlews, snipe, and the various\r\nsandpipers that feed along the seashores or frequent the inland marshes\r\nof every part of the world, nowhere more numerously than along our\r\nmuch embayed eastern coast. The plovers are especially interesting,\r\nand one of them, the noisy killdeer, is familiar all over the country,\r\nbreeding in upland fields, where four brown and spotted eggs are\r\nlaid in a little hollow of the open ground, plover fashion. Another\r\nnotable species, the golden plover, is a cosmopolitan, and a remarkable\r\nmigrant, journeying from its arctic breeding place to the tropics, not\r\nonly overland, but across thousands of miles of ocean, as from Nova\r\nScotia direct to Bermuda, and Alaska to Hawaii. The crested \"lapwing\"\r\nof Europe is another famous species. The plovers have short bills and\r\nlive on insects; but the sandpipers that in greenish or brown-streaked\r\ncoats flit along the shores pick up a more miscellaneous fare from\r\nthe edge of the sea and on exposed tide flats. Here too, are the very\r\nlonged-legged \"stilts,\" the phalaropes with lobes along their toes like\r\na grebe, the curlews, with their long, upcurved bills, the willets\r\nthat alarm all the rest by their cries as soon as they espy a gunner,\r\nthe big, gray godwits and many others. Various snipes form a group of\r\nsmall, swift fliers that haunt boggy land, where they probe the mud\r\nwith long bills furnished with nerves of great delicacy at the tip\r\nby which they can feel the hidden worms buried in the mud that are\r\ntheir favorite fare; and one of them is the swamp-haunting woodcock,\r\nbeloved of gourmands on both sides of the ocean. Europe and Asia have\r\nseveral other kinds of birds in this class not known here, such as\r\nthe coursers, and the Egyptian \"ziczac\" that now and then picks the\r\ncrocodile's teeth, and is almost the same as the historic lapwing, so\r\nfamiliar in Scotland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\n                       FROM GULLS TO KINGFISHERS\r\n\r\n\r\nOur scientific arrangement introduces next the gull family, followed\r\nby a series of groups that seems to the layman most miscellaneous. The\r\ngulls are a world-wide family of sea birds, seen also near bodies of\r\nwater in the interior of continents, especially northward, which live\r\non fish and floating edibles. They are mostly glistening white, often\r\nmarked with black about the head and wings, except the big brownish\r\nskuas that live by robbing other gulls of their catch and their nests\r\nof young. A very distinct group in the family are the smaller terns,\r\nwhose slender forms, long wings, and graceful flight give them the\r\nsuitable name of \"sea swallows.\" Another distinct lot is that of\r\nthe low-flying black \"skimmers.\" All these birds normally breed on\r\nsandbanks near shore, laying four handsomely variegated eggs in a mere\r\nshallow of earth, but a good many nest in colonies on the margin of\r\nfresh-water lakes. The gulls serve well as scavengers, but are not good\r\nto eat.\r\n\r\nRelated to the gulls, but very different in appearance, are the small,\r\ndark-colored, quaint auks, guillemots and puffins of northern coasts,\r\nthat look like miniature penguins, for they stand erect on two big\r\nfeet. They are fishers, with great skill in swimming and diving, and\r\nbreed in companies of thousands, sometimes, on the ledges of the\r\nsea-fronting cliffs of Labrador, northern Scotland, Alaska, and Arctic\r\nislands. The extinct \"great auk\" of the North Atlantic coasts was a\r\ngiant of this race.\r\n\r\nPassing the sand grouse of Africa and Russia, we come to the pigeons,\r\nrepresented in a bewildering variety of forms in every part of the\r\nworld. The United States has several species--the common wood dove, or\r\nmourning dove, the extinct \"wild pigeon,\" once here in millions, the\r\nbanded pigeon of the Pacific Coast, and several kinds of ground doves\r\nin the southwest. The rock dove, which is the original of the domestic\r\nvarieties, is still wild in Europe, together with several other\r\nspecies; and the Orient abounds in representatives of the family, some\r\nof them large and extremely handsome, especially in the division called\r\nfruit pigeons. To this family belonged that famous bird of the past,\r\nthe \"dodo\" of Mauritius.\r\n\r\nThere follow two big groups, the cuckoos and plantain eaters, and the\r\nparrots, which together have the peculiarity of two toes in front and\r\ntwo behind, instead of the customary three toes in front and one,\r\nor perhaps none, behind; the woodpeckers have the same \"yoke-toed\"\r\narrangement, but are distinct otherwise. The cuckoos are mainly\r\nOriental and very varied, although all show the slender form, long\r\ntail, and long curved beak that we see in our two American species, the\r\nblack-billed and yellow-billed; the most aberrant one in our country\r\nis the queer, lizard-catching road runner of southern California. None\r\nof the cuckoos seems a good nest maker. The nests of our common ones\r\nare loose platforms of twigs, and both species often drop eggs in\r\neach other's cradles; but they, in common with almost all the other\r\ncuckoos of the world, do at least incubate their eggs and care for\r\nthe nestlings, instead of leaving that task to some foster parent, as\r\ndoes the similar cuckoo of Europe. The most extraordinary feature of\r\nthis parasitic habit is the fact that the cuckoo often, if not always,\r\nfirst lays its egg in any convenient place, and then, taking it in its\r\nbeak, carries it to another bird's nest and puts the egg into it. This\r\naccounts for the frequent finding of a cuckoo's egg in nests into which\r\nso large a bird could not have crept.\r\n\r\nTo record the fact that about 500 different kinds of parrots are\r\ncatalogued will be a sufficient explanation of their dismissal with a\r\nfew general remarks. The larger number and most striking examples--the\r\ngreat cockatoos for instance--belong to Australia and the Malayan\r\nislands, but the Indian region, Africa, and tropical America abound in\r\nparrots. Probably the northernmost of the whole family is our Carolina\r\nparakeet, which formerly ranged in summer even to the Great Lakes,\r\nbut now is almost exterminated even from the great swamps of the Gulf\r\nCoast. Of the two kinds most often seen in cages--a custom that is\r\nalmost prehistoric in antiquity--the gray parrot is African, and the\r\ngreen or green and yellow \"Amazons\" come from South America.\r\n\r\nParrots are gregarious, nest in holes in trees, although a few live\r\nin holes in the ground or among loose rocks, and feed on all sorts\r\nof vegetable productions, including some very hard fruits cracked in\r\ntheir powerful bills, as is the habit of the gorgeous macaws of Central\r\nand South America. The lories of Australia are provided with tongues\r\nbrushlike at the tip, and besides eating seeds they lick the honey out\r\nof the blossoms of the eucalyptus and other flowering trees, and in so\r\ndoing effect the cross-fertilization of these trees in a country which\r\nhas no bees to do that service.\r\n\r\nPassing the brilliant rollers of the Old World, and the motmots and\r\nlittle gemlike todies of the New, we come to the extensive tribe of\r\nkingfishers, of which our blue and white example is a very modest\r\nspecimen--but the only one we have, while 150 other species are counted\r\nin the rest of the world, most of them in the Austro-Malayan region\r\nand in Africa. They vary immensely in size, colors, food and habits.\r\nA large section are not \"fishers\" at all, but dwell in wooded places,\r\nand subsist on insects caught on the wing, and on reptiles, mice, etc.,\r\nlike birds of prey. Few groups are so diversified and entertaining as\r\nthis one. Related to them are the bee-eaters, hoopoes, hornbills and\r\nothers that bring us to the owls, a suborder of which contains the\r\ngreat nightjar family to which our whippoorwills and nighthawks belong,\r\nwith the swifts and humming birds as near relations. Then come the\r\nwoodpeckers, much alike all over the world (but absent from Australia),\r\nfollowed by the gorgeous trogons of Mexico and some other tropical\r\nbeauties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\n                            PASSERINE BIRDS\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now run through the list of all the orders of birds except\r\nthe last and largest--the \"passerine\" birds, the ordinary songsters\r\nof the fields and woodlands of the northern hemisphere. There are\r\nfifty families contained in the order. Here, among our North American\r\nmigratory birds are to be found the kingbirds, pewees and other\r\n\"tyrant\" flycatchers; the larks of our western plains and eastern\r\nseashore; that sprite of the Rocky Mountain brooks, the ouzel; the\r\nwaxwings, the butcher birds; the pretty greenish vireos that build\r\nthose exquisite, cup-shaped hanging nests made of grapevine bark and\r\nspider's silk; and the swallows that become so friendly every summer\r\nabout barns, paying rent by diligent service in insect killing. Then\r\nthere is that interesting little group of small and cheerful climbers,\r\nthe nuthatches, chickadees, and creepers, that rid trees of hosts of\r\ninjurious insects which they dig out of crevices of the bark as they\r\nscramble up and down the trunks, some of them continuing the good work\r\nall through the winter. These have their counterparts in Europe, for\r\nin respect of our common song birds, as of the birds of prey and game\r\nbirds, the avifauna of Europe and North America is virtually one. The\r\ndifferences are mainly in the few representatives of tropical groups\r\nthat visit northern countries in summer, those of Europe partaking of\r\nthe African or Indian families, while we have wandering species from\r\ngroups that are properly inhabitants of Mexico and southward. Such, in\r\nfact, are our few humming birds, hundreds of species of which belong\r\nto the American tropics (and none to the Old World), our two tanagers,\r\nmembers of a very large tropical family, and our blackbirds and\r\norioles, far more numerous in species south of the United States.\r\n\r\nWhile we have many delightful vocalists, the best singers of all\r\nour birds are no doubt the thrushes, and that is true of thrushes\r\nelsewhere, for the European blackbird and mavis, the celebrated\r\nnightingale, the solitaire--both that of the West Indies and that of\r\nour northern Pacific Coast--and several noted musicians in the Orient,\r\nare of this melodious family. Which is the best singer of them all\r\nwill never be settled, for the citizen of each country likes best that\r\nto which he is most used; but to Americans nothing can be better than\r\nthe evening carol of the wood thrush, the serene hymnlike music of the\r\nhermit, or the sweet and wavering call of the veery. Yet in the South,\r\nwhere these northern thrushes are rarely heard at their best, the palm\r\nis given to the mocking bird, which, like the northern brown thrasher,\r\nrivals all in turn by simulating their notes in a liquid melody that,\r\nespecially when heard in the calm of a moonlit summer evening, seems of\r\nsurpassing beauty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\n             THE BEASTS OF THE FIELD--SOME PRIMITIVE TYPES\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now arrived at the highest rank in the scale of animal\r\nlife--the four-footed, hair-clad, milk-nursed denizens of our woods and\r\nfields--the subclass Mammalia, mammals.\r\n\r\nThese are the \"animals\" of popular speech, but accuracy requires a\r\nmore distinctive expression, for every living thing not a plant is\r\nan \"animal.\" Unfortunately no such distinctive term exists in our\r\nlanguage, and hence we must borrow from the Latin the word \"mammal\" for\r\nthis group. It is correct, easy to remember, and there is no reason why\r\nit should not be used popularly as well as scientifically. It is good,\r\nbecause it is exact, and expresses the one great distinction which\r\nseparates mammals from all other animals--the feeding of the young on\r\nmilk secreted by the mother. The milk-producing glands were called\r\nin Latin \"mammæ,\" whence our word \"mammal\" and the technical term\r\nMammalia--animals that suckle their young.\r\n\r\nAnother peculiarity of the group is the coat of hair--persistently\r\ngrowing threads of horny substance produced from the skin in greater\r\nor less abundance and of varying quality and color. Its chief purpose\r\nappears to be that of keeping the body warm; and, as in the case of the\r\nfeathers clothing birds, it enables the blood to rise to and maintain\r\na temperature much higher than that of the air; hence the mammals are\r\n\"warm-blooded.\" This condition, gradually acquired, stimulated their\r\nactivity and hence their brain development, the result of which is a\r\nhigher degree of intelligence than is manifested, as a class, by any\r\nother animals, and a moving cause of their progress to the highest\r\nplane of organic evolution.\r\n\r\nThe history of the evolution of the Mammalia may be traced back to\r\nobscure beginnings in the Triassic, the oldest of the three divisions\r\nof the Secondary or Mesozoic era. Just preceding that time there\r\nflourished a group of reptiles, the Theromorpha, whose skull, teeth,\r\nand forelimbs were very like those of a modern beast of prey; and\r\nzoölogists consider it \"altogether probable\" that the origin of\r\nthe mammalian branch must be looked for among their number. It is\r\nnot doubted, however, that true mammals, although very small and\r\ninconspicuous, existed throughout the whole Mesozoic era, despite the\r\nfact that the world at that time was filled with ravenous reptiles.\r\nIndeed, it is believed that their steady development was an important\r\nagency in destroying the reptile population, largely by eating\r\ntheir eggs. At any rate, before the end of the Mesozoic era the two\r\ngrand divisions of Mammalia, Prototheria and Eutheria, had become\r\nestablished; and also the two primary divisions of the latter, the\r\nMarsupials and the Placentals, had been separated. Then came that\r\nextraordinary change in the physiography of the globe that marked the\r\nend of Mesozoic conditions and introduced those of the succeeding era\r\nnamed Tertiary. In the broader and higher land areas and the drier\r\nand more invigorating climate that followed, producing a vegetation\r\ntending constantly to become like that of the present, mammals found\r\nincreasingly favorable conditions, and became the dominant race of\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       RELICS OF PRIMITIVE TYPES\r\n\r\nThere live in Australia and New Guinea two curious little animals that\r\nmost nearly represent in their low and generalized organization the\r\nprimitive mammals, and differ so essentially from all other mammals\r\nthat they are classed by themselves as Prototheria (\"first beasts\").\r\nThey are the duckbill (Ornithorhynchus) and the spiny anteater\r\n(Echidna). The duckbill is a small, softly furred, web-footed creature,\r\nas aquatic in its habits as a beaver, which finds its food in the worms\r\nand other things that live in and on the mud of its chosen stream, and\r\ndigs a burrow in the bank for its home, where it stays most of the\r\ndaylight hours, and where its young are born. Its special peculiarity\r\nis that instead of the muzzle and mouth of an ordinary mammal, it is\r\nfurnished with a bill like that of a duck, and each jaw is armed with\r\nhorny plates to do the work of teeth; in the young ones true molar\r\n\"milk\" teeth are present, but are soon shed. The cheeks contain pouches\r\nin which a quantity of food can be stored, the animal carrying it in\r\nto the safety of its burrow to be eaten, and so avoiding the danger of\r\nbeing out for a long time of feeding.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OPOSSUM MOTHER AND YOUNG\r\n  Photo, American Museum of Natural History]\r\n\r\nThe echidnas are equally small, about eighteen inches long, covered\r\nwith a mingled coat of hair and strong spines, and mounted on short\r\nlegs and feet armed with powerful claws, for this animal dwells on\r\nland, and not only burrows, but must tear to pieces the hills of the\r\nants that form its only food. Its round little head terminates in a\r\nlong, slender snout containing a ribbon-shaped tongue with which it\r\nlicks up the ants from their ruined nests.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANTEATER, WHICH LIVES ON INSECTS CAUGHT IN THE STICKY\r\n  SALIVA OF ITS LONG TONGUE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SLOTH, AN ANIMAL WHICH KEEPS TO TREES AND IS ALMOST\r\n  HELPLESS ON THE GROUND]\r\n\r\nThe striking peculiarity of both these queer creatures, however, is\r\nthe fact that they lay eggs. These are few--sometimes only one--and\r\nrecall those of reptiles in their relatively large size, parchmentlike\r\nshells, and abundance of food-yolk. The duckbill deposits her eggs in\r\nher grass-lined burrow nest and covers them with her body until they\r\nquickly hatch. The blind and naked young then apply their lips to the\r\nnearest part of the mother's abdomen, and suck milk through the pores\r\nof the skin. In the echidna one sees a little advance on this extremely\r\nsimple beginning of nursing; for here, instead of being laid in a\r\nburrow nest, and covered by the mother, the echidna's egg is placed by\r\nthe mother within two parallel folds of skin which at that season form\r\na deep groove in the abdomen inclosing the nursing area, and is held\r\nthere until it hatches. When the young has attained a certain size the\r\nmother removes it from the \"pouch,\" but takes it in from time to time\r\nto suckle it.\r\n\r\nSuch are the Prototheria--one of the grand divisions of Mammalia, set\r\napart by reason of their laying the eggs from which the young will\r\nafterward be born, whereas in the other division or Eutheria (\"proper\r\nmammals\") the \"embryos,\" or unborn young, escape from the eggs in a\r\nless or greater degree of development before their birth from the\r\nmother. This period between the conception of life in the egg and its\r\nemergence at birth is called the period of gestation, and is much\r\nlonger in large animals than in small ones. Fundamental differences in\r\nmethod of birth divide the Eutheria into two groups, designated as\r\nNonplacentals and Placentals.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE MARSUPIALS\r\n\r\nThe word marsupial means \"pouched,\" and refers to the most\r\ncharacteristic peculiarity of the nonplacental division (order\r\nMarsupialia), which is the possession of a more or less pocketlike fold\r\nin the skin of the abdomen of the females within which the extremely\r\nimmature young are nourished.\r\n\r\nThe egg-laying mammals, also nonplacental, have the young inclosed in a\r\nprotective shell that they keep warm, as do the birds, until the embryo\r\nis sufficiently matured to be safely born. In the marsupials nature\r\nmeets the difficulty another way. The embryo is but little advanced\r\nwhen born, in fact it is utterly helpless and minute, being, even in\r\nthe case of the largest kangaroos, hardly as big as a mouse. It would\r\nbe fatal, of course, to turn it loose upon the world; and therefore the\r\nmother is provided with the pouch already described.\r\n\r\nThe instant an embryo is born the mother picks it up and places\r\nit within the pouch, where it crawls about until it touches and\r\ninstinctively takes hold of one of the threadlike teats. As it gets\r\nstronger it leaves the pouch now and then, but returns to it for\r\nnursing, sleeping, and protection when alarmed, until finally it\r\ndeparts altogether.\r\n\r\nThis description applies to the most advanced families of the order.\r\nIn the oldest and most generalized families of marsupials, such as the\r\nbanded anteaters, there is virtually no pouch at all.\r\n\r\nAs almost the whole marsupial tribe are natives of Australasia, it is\r\nodd that the family with which we must begin a list of them--the true\r\nopossums--should be American, and quite unknown in Australia. This is\r\nexplainable when it is known that this family (Didelphidæ) is the most\r\narchaic of this ancient tribe, and was well established in Cretaceous\r\ntimes, and then and later was widely distributed in Europe and on this\r\ncontinent; yet so little change has occurred in the race that teeth\r\nfrom the Laramie formations of Wyoming are hardly distinguishable\r\nfrom those in the jaws of our 'possum-up-a-gum-tree to-day. No wonder\r\nthe quaint creature is hoary and wrinkled; he is a very Methuselah\r\namong mammals, and looks it! All opossums seem to have disappeared\r\nfrom Europe before the close of the Miocene, but continued to survive\r\nnumerously in South America. They probably owe their long career, in\r\ncompetition with animals of so much higher grade, to their small size,\r\nforest life, nocturnal habits, ability to eat all sorts of food, and,\r\nmost of all, to their great fecundity. Our common opossum is the most\r\nnorthern of its kind, and ranges over the whole country as far north\r\nas the latitude of Lake Erie; it appears never to have crossed the\r\nHudson River until comparatively recent times, but is now frequently\r\nmet with in New England and on Long Island. It is at home in all sorts\r\nof places, except, perhaps, on the dry plains, for it is primarily an\r\narboreal animal, aided in climbing about trees by its naked, prehensile\r\ntail, by which it may hang to a branch while using its forefeet to rob\r\na bird's nest or gather fruit. It will eat anything it can get hold\r\nof, and with its sharp teeth, which number fifty, will kill animals\r\nas large as itself; hence it is a destructive raider of henroosts and\r\nsitting birds as well as a seeker of mouse nests and insects.\r\n\r\nOpossums are amazingly prolific, and have broods of a dozen or more\r\nin many cases. These often crawl on the mother's back, and cling with\r\nclaws and twisted tails to her fur and tail, and so are carried about.\r\nBurdened by these kittens she hunts daily--or rather at night, for the\r\nmost part--and defends them savagely and bravely against foxes and\r\nother enemies, often successfully standing off the farmer's dogs. With\r\na family to defend, or when faced by any foe that is at all equal to\r\nits powers, the opossum does not resort to \"playing 'possum,\" for this\r\nis a last resource when surprised and \"cornered\" by an overwhelming\r\ndanger that it can neither avoid nor cope with.\r\n\r\nThe proverbial feigning of death by this animal (many other small\r\nanimals do the same) has excited much popular interest, and has\r\nreceived many explanations. I have suggested that it is a survival of\r\na practice which in past ages had been an advantageous ruse of the\r\nancestors of the opossums.\r\n\r\nSeveral other species of opossums exist in Central and South America,\r\nsome much smaller than ours and one hardly bigger than a mouse. One\r\nkind, the \"yapock,\" is aquatic, dwelling on land only during the\r\ninfancy of its progeny, and until they are old enough to be taught\r\nto swim. All the marsupials inhabiting the Americas (except a rare\r\nlittle molelike one in Patagonia), belong in the family Didelphidæ; but\r\nthis family is not known in Australia, where the so-called \"opossums\"\r\nbelong to a different tribe. They were named after our common northern\r\nopossum, which was known to science before Australia and its pouched\r\nfauna were discovered.\r\n\r\nOne of the extraordinary things in zoölogy is that Australia, and\r\nthe near-by islands that constitute with it a faunistic province,\r\nhas no indigenous mammals (except a few mice and bats) other than\r\nmarsupials, which have become so diversified as to represent the varied\r\nkinds of animals seen elsewhere; and no marsupials live anywhere else\r\nin the world except our single and primitive American family. This\r\ncurious situation has caused much discussion. It is known that in late\r\nMesozoic times marsupials were scattered all over the globe, but became\r\nexterminated everywhere outside of Australasia and America long before\r\nthe present era. The Australian marsupials are supposed to be the\r\nsurvivors, flourishing in a favorable region; but why no other mammals\r\nsurvived there is still a puzzle. Another theory is that Australia,\r\nregarded as formerly a part of a much larger southern continent, is the\r\noriginal center from which the ancestors of the Marsupialia spread,\r\nbut failed to maintain their race outside of their original home, with\r\nwhich South America was then connected.\r\n\r\nThe most archaic of these marsupials is the celebrated Tasmanian\r\n\"wolf,\" or thylacine, which resembles in size and shape a pointer\r\ndog, but with a longer muzzle, and that long tail which seems to be a\r\ngeneral characteristic of the Marsupialia. It is brownish gray, with a\r\nrow of darker bands crossing the hinder half of the back, and is one of\r\nthe most swift-footed and savage hunters in the world. It is confined\r\nto Tasmania, where it became so destructive to sheep when the island\r\nwas settled that it was killed off until almost exterminated. This\r\nisland was the home, also, of another smaller beast, looking somewhat\r\nlike a wolverine with the head of a hyena, which was so morose, savage,\r\nand untamable that the settlers named it \"Tasmanian devil,\" and\r\ndestroyed it as rapidly as they could. It hid by day in some rock den\r\nand made its forays at night. This truly diabolic creature belonged to\r\nthe family of dasyures, which is represented in Australia by several\r\nsmall, predatory beasts called \"native cats.\" They fill the rôle there\r\nof our northern martens and weasels, and most of their time is passed\r\nin trees, although some are fond of hunting amid rocks and brush. They\r\nlike to come about ranches and villages, where they are the pest of\r\npoultry keepers, but are rarely domesticated, even partly. Another\r\ncarnivorous group (phascogales) contains the \"pouched mice,\" which are\r\nnot mouselike, except in size, but have more the nature of shrews that\r\nlive in trees and hunt birds and any small creatures they can catch.\r\n\r\nOf the phalangers a curious specimen is the wombat, named \"native bear\"\r\nby the early colonists--an animal about the size of our woodchuck,\r\nshaped like a miniature bear, and living mainly on roots, which it\r\ndigs at night with its powerful claws; its thick fur makes its skin\r\nvaluable in market. Related to it structurally, but much like our gray\r\nsquirrel in shape, and having an even longer and more bushy tail, is\r\nthe charming sugar squirrel, which dwells in trees, and sails in long\r\nflights from tree to tree in the twilights and on moonlight nights just\r\nas do our flying squirrels; there are also tree phalangers so small\r\nthey are called \"flying mice.\" Other tree-living phalangers are the\r\n\"opossums\" of Australia, whose soft gray pelts are exported in great\r\nnumbers to foreign fur markets.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A KANGAROO MOTHER\r\n  Showing young carried in the abdominal pouch]\r\n\r\nThe kangaroos and wallabies (Macropodidæ) represent the highest\r\ndevelopment of the marsupial type, and number some fifty species spread\r\nover all Australia and New Guinea. While the majority inhabit open\r\ngrassy plains, others brushy districts and rocks, and a few dwell in\r\ntrees, the kangaroos proper include half a dozen of the largest kinds,\r\nthe commonest of which is the great gray \"boomer\" or \"forester,\" of\r\nthe colonists, often seen in menageries. It stands four to five feet\r\ntall, with a tail thirty to thirty-six inches long; but this size is\r\nconsiderably exceeded by that of the red or woolly kangaroo, of eastern\r\nand southern Australia. Furthermore, fossil remains show that in the\r\nPleistocene era kangaroos far bigger than even these existed there in\r\nnumerous extinct species--one, for instance, whose skull alone measured\r\nnearly a yard in length. These animals take the place in Australia\r\nof the deer of northern countries. They are very gregarious, and\r\nare always to be met with in droves. Each drove frequents a certain\r\ndistrict and has its particular camping and feeding grounds. The animal\r\nhas a dreadful weapon of defense in the powerful hind claw, which it\r\ncan use like the tusk of a boar.\r\n\r\nThe smaller kangaroos are called \"wallabies,\" or brush kangaroos, and\r\nfrequent scrub jungle and rocky places. These furnish most of the skins\r\nand leather sent to European markets and, like the big species of the\r\nplains, have been greatly reduced in numbers by hunters and sheep\r\nherders. Some of them are confined to the rough deserts and mountains,\r\nwhere they jump about the rocks with astonishing agility. One small\r\ngenus includes the swift harelike species that resemble our jack\r\nrabbits in habits; and there are also the \"dorca\" kangaroos, which are\r\narboreal in habit and handsomely colored. Another group are ratlike in\r\nform, colors, and manners, running rather than leaping, and dwelling\r\namong scrub and grass, scratching the ground all day in search of the\r\nroots upon which they feed, and making havoc in the frontiersman's\r\npotato patches. Several kinds have prehensile tails, which they use\r\napparently only to carry to their underground homes the long grass of\r\nwhich they make their beds. They associate in connected burrows like a\r\nrabbit warren.\r\n\r\nIn the varied forms and functions they present, as beasts of prey, as\r\ngrazers or root diggers, as ground-running, tree-climbing, burrowing\r\nor cave-haunting forms, some solitary and slow, others agile and\r\ngregarious, the marsupial tribe in its isolated corner of the earth\r\nexhibits an epitome of the whole mammalian world. It shows in a\r\nconspicuous way how the necessity and habit of making a living in\r\nvaried circumstances, and exposed to lively competition, restricting\r\nevery species to a particular manner, brings about a suitable\r\nmodification of structure.\r\n\r\n\r\n            THE EDENTATA--ANTEATERS, SLOTHS, AND ARMADILLOS\r\n\r\nAt the base of the great division of Eutherian mammals, to which\r\nbelong all that remain to be described, is found the order Edentata\r\n(\"toothless\"), whose modern representatives are few and unimportant\r\nin comparison with those of past ages, when gigantic ground sloths,\r\narmored glyptodons, and other fossil species flourished in a luxuriant\r\nworld. The name is not well chosen, for many of these animals possess\r\nat least a few teeth, but always composed of vasodentine and not\r\ncoated with enamel. Although the origin of this race is obscure, it\r\nwas certainly far in the past, for its characters are archaic in many\r\nparticulars, and its members are often far separated in structure,\r\nand also in their geographical distribution. Two families belong to\r\nthe Old World, one in the Orient and another in South Africa, but all\r\nthe other edentates are American. The Oriental one includes most of\r\nthe \"pangolins,\" or scaly anteaters, which are covered from head to\r\nfoot in a coat of mail formed of overlapping horny plates, and can\r\nroll themselves into a ball that will defy any jaws not big enough to\r\ntear them to pieces; while the African family consists of the naked,\r\nlong-nosed aard-vark (\"ant bear\"), which burrows in the ground, and\r\ncuts its way at night into the mud forts of termites and other ants in\r\nsearch of its favorite food. These two ancient creatures differ so much\r\nin their anatomy from the American edentates that they are classified\r\nby some naturalists in a separate order (Fodentia); and they differ\r\nalmost as radically from one another.\r\n\r\nIt should not be surprising to find most of the modern edentates in\r\nSouth America, since that is the most ancient and unchanged of all the\r\ncontinents; but a few sorts of anteaters, sloths, and armadillos alone\r\nremain where once their race, in its heroic age, dominated the world\r\nof its time. The puny survivors look and act like the relics they are.\r\nThe \"great\" anteater, or tamandua, standing eighteen inches or more in\r\nheight, has flatfooted, bearlike hind feet, and short forelegs that\r\nend in huge claws bent under, or backward, so that the animal walks\r\non the outer face of its toes. Its tail is a great bushy mass of hair\r\nwith which the animal may cover itself as with a blanket, and its long\r\nneck tapers off into a head with a very long nose and little room for\r\nbrains. The big claws are not used for burrowing an underground home,\r\nbut for digging up the nests of ants and termites which it licks up\r\nwith its long, sticky tongue. When one realizes the enormous colonies\r\nof ants in the tropics it is not amazing that so large an animal should\r\nsubsist exclusively on these minute creatures. The claws are formidable\r\nweapons of defense also, the animal throwing itself on its back and\r\ndefying the foe, or rising on its hind legs and giving a tearing,\r\nbearlike hug that even a man might well fear. This is a slow-moving\r\ncreature, more fond of open country than forests; but a smaller\r\ntamandua belongs wholly to the woods and spends both days and nights in\r\nthe tree tops, tearing open the burrows and nests of arboreal insects\r\nand devouring their inhabitants and their stores of honey and young.\r\nA third species is the rare little yellow two-toed anteater of the\r\nIsthmus region, which appears to live almost wholly on wasp grubs.\r\n\r\nMuch like these in organization are the two species of sloth, hairy\r\ncreatures that hang all day long by their long, muscular limbs and\r\ntwo or three curved claws, underneath a branch of the tree through\r\nwhose top they slowly creep about at night, collecting, crushing with\r\ntheir peglike teeth, and swallowing the leaves that constitute their\r\nfare. Their long hair, naturally gray, becomes green by accumulating a\r\ncoating of minute plants that thrive on it, and this helps to conceal\r\nthe sloths amid the foliage, yet they are killed by eagles and by all\r\nsorts of beasts of prey, against which they have no means of defense.\r\nThese listless creatures are the degenerate descendants of a very long\r\nancestry. The early Tertiary rocks of Argentina contain the bones of\r\nsmall slothlike animals that apparently were ground dwellers and must\r\nhave been active diggers. Later that region became filled with larger\r\nground sloths, apparently their descendants, that are believed to have\r\nbrowsed on bushes and trees; and some of these became the megatheres\r\nof the late Tertiary, which were as big as elephants. Similar giants\r\ninhabited North America.\r\n\r\nEven in the earliest days known to paleontologists the anteater-sloth\r\ngroup had become well separated from their fellow edentates, the\r\narmadillos, arguing a far-preceding origin. In the later Tertiary\r\nthe latter type developed such huge and heavily armored forms as\r\nthe glyptodon, on whose bony shell the teeth of even the great\r\nsaber-toothed tigers of the time could make little impression. These\r\ngrotesque tortoiselike glyptodons, of which there was a great variety,\r\nwere vegetable eaters, and some survived to a time so recent that\r\nthere is evidence that they were finally killed off by human hunters.\r\nBeside them were smaller armadillos, more like the modern ones, which\r\nare armored with overlapping belts of horny material between which\r\ncoarse hairs sprout; but the amount of this armor varies greatly among\r\nthe several species scattered from Patagonia to northern Mexico. In\r\nsome it is a continuous shell, in others it consists of several belts,\r\nin still others is nearly absent. Armadillos are carnivorous, digging\r\nout worms, grubs and the underground nests of wasps, catching insects\r\nof all sorts, stealing eggs and young from ground-nesting birds,\r\nkilling serpents by leaping on them and sawing their bodies in two by\r\nmeans of the rough edges of their plates. In some places on the pampas\r\narmadillo burrows are so numerous as to make riding dangerous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\n                              THE GNAWERS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great order Rodentia--rats, mice, rabbits, porcupines, squirrels,\r\nbeavers, etc., derives its name from the Latin verb _rodere_, to gnaw,\r\nor eat away (something), and is characterized by the great development\r\nof the front (incisor) teeth, by means of which rodents get their\r\nliving by biting off, or gnawing through, the plants and woody stems\r\non which they feed, or which they use in constructing their dwellings.\r\nAll are primarily vegetable eaters, yet none will refuse a meal of\r\nflesh when opportunity offers to get it, and some are decidedly\r\ncarnivorous, especially as to fish. They are distributed all over the\r\nworld, including the Australian region. They are chiefly terrestrial,\r\nand often burrow or live in ready-made burrows. Some are aquatic, such\r\nas the voles; others, like the squirrels, are arboreal. In perhaps\r\na majority of the forms the hind legs are much longer and stronger\r\nthan the forelegs, giving the animals great leaping power, while the\r\nforefeet, with their long and flexible fingers, are constantly used\r\nas hands. Many are beautifully marked in varied tints of gray, brown,\r\nred, and black, so that their pelts have value in the fur market;\r\nand their flesh is an important element in human food. On the other\r\nhand the activity of these animals, when numerous, causes serious\r\ndamage to gardens, crops and orchards and one of them, the rat, is\r\nunquestionably the most dangerous animal to human health and prosperity\r\nin the whole animal kingdom. The fecundity of the smaller, murine\r\nspecies, is great, and from time to time they increase inordinately in\r\nfavorable places, and swarm abroad in vast and destructive migrations.\r\nWere it not for the fact that the rodents furnish the principal part\r\nof the food of predatory mammals, reptiles, and birds, and are thus\r\nkept down, the globe would soon become so populous with this tribe that\r\nhardly anything else could maintain existence.\r\n\r\nThe distinguishing anatomical characteristic of the rodents is the\r\ndentition. The canines, so essential to carnivorous, predatory animals,\r\nare here completely absent, and a long empty space intervenes between\r\nthe incisors and the molars, or cheek teeth, which vary greatly in\r\nnumber and form among the different families. The incisors consist\r\nof a single pair in each jaw, very large and strong, and composed of\r\nvasodentine, _faced only_ with hard enamel, often yellow or red. As the\r\nsofter substance behind the facing wears away more easily, the incisor\r\ntakes a chisel shape, leaving the hard enamel in front projecting\r\nslightly as a cutting edge; thus these teeth always remain sharp. The\r\nrodents are traced back in their lineage to the order Tillodontia of\r\nEocene time. The oldest family of modern type in the order is that of\r\nthe squirrels.\r\n\r\nLet us begin with the rabbits and hares (family Leporidæ). The name\r\nproperly applies to the Old World species _Lepus cuniculus_, the\r\nburrowing wild rabbit from which all our various domestic rabbits are\r\ndescended, whose special characteristic is the fact that they live\r\nin holes in the ground of their own digging, and in large colonies\r\ncalled warrens. All the other species make their breeding beds and\r\nresting places on the surface of the ground, in the best concealment\r\n(outside of forests) that they can find. Such a home is called the\r\nanimal's \"form,\" and when it contains a litter of young the mother\r\ncovers them with a blanket of hair which at that season she is shedding\r\ncopiously. Strictly speaking, all the Leporidæ, except the _cuniculus_,\r\nare \"hares\"; but the general term \"rabbit\" is now so common that the\r\nscientific distinction is of no consequence. Europe and Asia have\r\ntwo kinds of hares, and several exist in this country, such as the\r\nfamiliar \"cottontail\" or bush rabbit of the east, the southern swamp\r\nrabbit, and several species of large, long-eared, swift-footed hares\r\nof the western plains called \"jack rabbits.\" The most important one,\r\nhowever, is the large northern one named \"snowshoe rabbit,\" because\r\nin winter it receives a broad growth of hair on the feet, aiding it\r\nin traveling over the snow. This rabbit turns white in winter, the\r\nhairs losing their color with the advent of cold, as also does the big\r\narctic hare which wanders as far north as land extends. These northern\r\nhares are the chief dependence for food in winter of all the Canadian\r\nfur-bearing animals, and indirectly of the native Indians. Consequently\r\nwhen, as happens at intervals of a few years, the rabbits of a\r\ndistrict all but wholly die off by an epidemic, a famine and dreadful\r\ndistress occurs--or used to when civilized aid was less available than\r\nnow--in northern Canada, and the commercial outcome of furs is greatly\r\ndiminished.\r\n\r\nAs the hares feed on herbage and bark, obtainable all the year round,\r\nthey are abroad in winter; but they have a family of small cousins, the\r\npikas (Lagomyidæ) that inhabit our western mountain tops above timber\r\nline and must hibernate. Other species abound in the Himalayas. They\r\nare little, short-eared, tailless creatures that make their homes in\r\ncompanies among loose rocks, and store in their deep crevices enough\r\ndried grass and flowering plants to keep themselves alive until the\r\nlate spring of those cold heights. Western folks call them conies.\r\n\r\nThe porcupines are large, plantigrade rodents notable for the mixture\r\nof quill-like spines with the hair. This is most conspicuous in the\r\nEuropean species, which bristles with spines reaching far beyond the\r\nhips and concealing the tail, forming an excellent defensive armor.\r\nSome smaller African and East Indian species are less well armed, and\r\nhave longer tails, at the end of which are tufts of spines, making\r\nan effective weapon. All of these pass their time and get their food\r\non the ground. Our American porcupines (family Cercolabidæ) differ\r\nsomewhat anatomically and live for the most part in trees, although\r\nour common eastern porcupine wanders about a great deal in summer,\r\nespecially at night, feeding on herbage, and rejoicing in a find of\r\nbones or other saline food here and there. It is defended by a coat of\r\nlong black hair in which spines are plentifully mingled, and the short,\r\nflat tail, covered with thick spines, may give a sidewise stroke that\r\nmakes man or beast cautious about attacking an animal that otherwise\r\nseems so lethargic and helpless. The porcupines of this family,\r\nhowever, really belong to trees, where they slowly consume the foliage\r\nand tender bark, and remain quietly through even Canadian winters. The\r\nPacific side of the country has a similar species in the yellow-haired\r\nporcupine; and several smaller kinds exist in Central and South\r\nAmerica with scanty spines and long prehensile tails.\r\n\r\nClosely allied to the porcupines are the gregarious viscachas of the\r\nSouth American plains, that live in \"villages\" of burrows, and much\r\nresemble prairie dogs in appearance and habits; also the chinchillas of\r\nthe high levels of the Andes, whose soft gray coat is one of the prizes\r\nof the furrier. Here, too, come the swift-footed, slender agoutis and\r\npacas of South America, many species of which exist and are useful as\r\nfood; and a neighboring family contains the little cavies, from one of\r\nwhich are derived our pet \"guinea pigs,\" which are not pigs and do not\r\ncome from Guinea; also their cousin, the almost aquatic capybara, which\r\nmeasures three feet long, and so is the biggest known rodent. This is\r\nmuch hunted for its flesh, and is the principal prey of the jaguar.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to the world-wide tribe of rats and mice formed by\r\na group of eight families, of which the typical one (Muridæ) alone\r\ncontains a third of all Rodentia, and the other seven creatures\r\ndiffering greatly from these familiar models. Many are small, such as\r\nthe house mouse (originally a native of southeastern Asia, as also\r\nwere the rats that commerce has carried all over the civilized globe),\r\nand the even tinier harvest mice, gray or brown in plain color, and\r\nwith long, slender and nearly hairless tails and legs fairly equal in\r\nsize. Thence in size they grade up to the stature of the rat, and from\r\nthat on to the South African \"springhaas\" which is as big as a rabbit,\r\nand to our muskrat, two feet long, counting in its tail. Although\r\nessentially alike in structure some have varied widely from the\r\nordinary type. Thus the jerboas, several species of which inhabit the\r\nplains of Asia and Africa, have the hind legs so long that their bones\r\nare considerably longer than the distance from the root of the tail to\r\nthe nose; and they progress in long rapid leaps, balancing themselves\r\nby long tails, often tufted at the end. The big \"jumping hare\" of\r\nSouth Africa has much the appearance of a kangaroo with a squirrellike\r\ntail; and a genus of exquisitely dressed mice in our sandy Southwest\r\nare called \"kangaroo\" mice. In fact one of our commonest reddish field\r\nmice, found all over the country, has similar proportions, and is\r\nremarkable for its long leaps when hurried.\r\n\r\nA shortening of the tail is seen in the voles, to which the common\r\nmeadow mice of various species belong, and still more in the lemmings,\r\nin the Old World mole rats, and in our pouched gophers. All these are\r\nnot only ground-keeping kinds, but burrowers, and have no use for a\r\nlong tail, save in the case of the muskrat, which is really a big vole\r\nthat has taken to an aquatic life, and needs an oar to scull himself\r\nthrough the water; for muskrats swim more by means of their tails than\r\nby their feet. The foremost burrowers are the pouched gophers, whose\r\nlong tunnels, and food-getting, do so much damage to crops in the\r\ncentral plains region of this country. They must be distinguished from\r\nthe ground squirrels, also called \"gophers.\"\r\n\r\nAn interesting diversity of habits may be met with here. Some rodents\r\nlive in deeply excavated burrows, others in shallow diggings or holes\r\nin stumps and rock crevices; some, like the water voles, reside in\r\nholes in the banks of streams, or, like the muskrat, heap up \"houses\"\r\nin a marsh in which to pass the winter in security; while still others\r\nconstruct ball-like nests among the herbage, or in bushes and trees.\r\nSome truly hibernate in cold countries, like the famous dormice of\r\nEurope, and our equally sound sleeper, the American jumping mouse;\r\nbut mostly they stay in snug habitations and live through the winter\r\non collections of food, or, like field mice, gather seeds abroad even\r\nin the coldest weather, or poke about under the snow for food, as do\r\nthe lemmings. From time to time certain species, especially of the\r\nshort-tailed field mice and the lemmings, multiply excessively in some\r\ndistrict, and then are forced to spread away from their birthplace in\r\nthose migrations of myriads which form the \"plagues\" that devastate\r\nlarge tracts of country. They march on until an accumulation of enemies\r\nand an epidemic of illness combine to kill them off.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   SQUIRRELS, WOODCHUCKS AND BEAVERS\r\n\r\nSquirrels in form and activities are much alike all over the world,\r\nand are absent only from Australia and Madagascar. The long, bushy\r\ntail that makes so excellent a blanket as it is wrapped about their\r\nbodies when curled up asleep, is the badge and pride of the tribe. They\r\ninhabit hollows in the trees or sometimes holes among their roots, and\r\nin summer make globular nests of leaves and twigs in which the young\r\nare nursed and trained. Nuts form their staple food, but berries,\r\nfruits, roots, funguses, insect grubs, etc., offer changes in fare\r\nwith the recurring seasons. Sometimes great ingenuity is displayed in\r\ngetting at this food. Some species are arrant robbers of birds' nests,\r\nand now and then kill and eat small birds and mammals; and the older\r\nmales are resolutely kept away from their babies by the mothers for\r\nfear of cannibalism. This catholic appetite, and their willingness to\r\nwander from place to place in search of things seasonable, enable\r\nsquirrels to find food of some sort every month of the year, yet most\r\nspecies have the forethought to lay up in more or less secret places\r\na winter supply of provender; consequently no species of Sciurus\r\nhibernates, strictly speaking.\r\n\r\nThis storing of winter provender is a matter that has been regarded\r\nwith more general interest, perhaps, than any other feature of animal\r\neconomy, and is mainly manifested among the rodents, although practiced\r\nin a limited way by some others, as for instance, by weasels and foxes.\r\nIt looks like conscious foresight of the famine time to come, but it\r\nis no doubt in the main, if not wholly, instinctive, since the young,\r\nwho have had no experience of the winter's scarcity or imprisonment\r\nahead, make suitable preparations. It seems to me that this habit,\r\nso necessary to the existence of small, vegetarian creatures in cold\r\nclimates, arose in some such way as this:\r\n\r\nThe little animals that store supplies designed to keep them alive\r\nthrough the winter are those whose food is for one reason or another\r\nunobtainable then. Remember, also, that they are feebly endowed with\r\npowers either for defense or for escape outside their homes, and when\r\ngathering their food must not loiter much to eat as they go, but must\r\npick up what they can carry and hasten to the safety of their doorways.\r\nThis is the reason why surviving species of such animals have acquired\r\ncheek pouches, in which they can transport a fair meal of their food to\r\nbe eaten at home at leisure.\r\n\r\nDuring the larger part of the year food is scant, and these rodents\r\nget into the way of picking up every bit they can find, and seem so\r\nrestless and energetic that some of them, such as the viscachas and\r\npack rats, accumulate about their burrows or nests quantities of\r\ninedible things, moved, apparently, by mere objectless acquisitiveness.\r\nThe search for food, the foremost occupation and anxiety of these small\r\nwood-folk, would be increasingly stimulated as the ripening season of\r\nthe seeds and nuts on which they depend advanced, and the impulse to\r\nincessant industry, so necessary in the poorer parts of the year, would\r\nnow be overworked, and each animal, in his haste to be up and doing,\r\nwould constantly bring home more food than would be consumed, so that\r\nit would pile up in the accustomed \"dining room.\" The gradual failure\r\nof outdoor supplies, as winter came on, would lead to the eating, with\r\nincreasing frequency, of those fragments casually saved in and about\r\nthe burrow or house, which, from their nature, would not have decayed.\r\nThe animal which had been most busy and clever in food gathering would\r\nown the largest amount of the leavings of these autumnal feasts. Having\r\nthe most food he would be among those of the colony or neighborhood\r\nstrongest and most likely to survive, and to give to his offspring the\r\ntendency to strength and industry which had been his salvation. This\r\nwould be continued and shaped by the process of natural selection into\r\na valuable, instinctive habit of gathering nonperishable food in large\r\nquantities every autumn, and thus providing themselves with stores\r\nto last through the coming winter; but it does not follow that the\r\nsquirrels and mice are conscious of this wise forethought.\r\n\r\nThe striped, chattering, ever-busy chipmunks, of which America\r\npossesses several delightful species, although able to ascend into\r\ntrees, and frequently doing so, are groundlings, and fond of rocky\r\nplaces into whose crevices they can quickly rush when an enemy is seen\r\nor heard; hence their fondness for the stone walls that in the East\r\ndivide farm fields, and in general they are more inclined to associate\r\nwith man and his works than are the tree squirrels, although the grays\r\nlend themselves readily to the semidomestication of residence in\r\nvillage streets and city parks, as the red never does. The chipmunks\r\ndig long underground tunnels, enlarged here and there into chambers\r\nserving as bedrooms, storerooms for food, and refuse bins; and the\r\nnorthwestern species are so numerous that between what they eat and\r\nwaste in gardens and grainfields and the bad runways for water their\r\ngalleries make, they are justly regarded as a pest.\r\n\r\nThese pretty but troublesome chipmunks are called \"gophers\" in some\r\nparts of the West, but that name is more generally given to the gray or\r\nbrownish ground squirrels of the plains, classified as spermophiles by\r\nnaturalists; and they are so varied, numerous and destructive wherever\r\ngrain is grown, from the prairies of Kansas and Nebraska to the\r\nCalifornia valleys, and northward to the Saskatchewan, that extensive\r\nand costly poisoning operations are necessary to suppress them. Similar\r\nto them, but larger, are the prairie dogs, whose communities, or\r\ntowns, of burrows and tunnels render useless large tracts of land in\r\nthe southern half of the plains. Very similar animals to these abound\r\nin Russia and eastward throughout the open country of central Asia.\r\nThey have undoubtedly increased much within late years through the\r\nkilling off of the natural enemies that in the old days held their\r\nmultiplication in check.\r\n\r\nThe prairie dogs used to be called \"marmots,\" a term that applies\r\nmore properly to some larger European burrowing rodents and to our\r\nwoodchucks, which are so common all over the eastern half of the\r\ncountry, and, in another species, on the summits of the northern\r\nRockies, where they are known as \"whistlers.\" The most remarkable\r\nthing about them is the length and intensity of their dormancy in\r\nhibernation. There remains only the beaver, the largest of the rodents\r\nexcept the capybara, and altogether the most important one, measured\r\nby the value of its fur, and by the service its race has done through\r\nthousands of years in preparing, by its clearings and dams, valleys for\r\nman's cultivation.\r\n\r\nEvery beaver settlement is a true colony, the offspring of some\r\nprevious settlement, which may be hundreds of years old. When such a\r\nsettlement becomes too populous for the food supply, young males and\r\ntheir mates travel to some fresh spot by a small woodland stream, and\r\nbegin life by digging a burrow in the bank with an underwater entrance,\r\nand at once dam up the stream by piling sticks, sod and mud across\r\nits current at some favorable spot below their home, the effect, if\r\nnot the conscious purpose, of which is to maintain a depth of water\r\nin the stream at all seasons sufficient to cover the entrance to the\r\nburrow, and also to permit the storage of green wood under water (and\r\nice) near the home for food (they eat the bark) during the next winter.\r\nThe young beavers born that season will remain through the winter\r\nwith the parents, and a domelike house is usually built in which the\r\nfamily lives. Next season the young set up a home for themselves near\r\nby, and so the colony grows. Beavers get most of their food by cutting\r\ndown trees other than evergreens, and gnawing the bark. As the trees\r\ndisappear near the bank, and the colony increases, the dam is enlarged\r\nso as to spread the set-back water over a wider territory; and later\r\ncanals are cut deep into the woods, permitting far-away trees to be\r\nfelled, and their pieces floated to the houses, especially in gathering\r\nthe supply for winter. Old dams are sometimes 100 or more yards long,\r\nand are built with astonishing intelligence with reference to holding\r\nback a great breadth of water. These are diligently and skillfully\r\nrepaired; and the houses become, in the course of years, big enough to\r\naccommodate three generations of beavers at once, and are so massive,\r\nespecially when frozen in winter, which is the time of most danger from\r\ntheir enemies, that they are practically safe from attack. From such a\r\nmature colony others are continually formed, until in a level, swampy\r\nregion the whole district is well occupied by beavers. This is possible\r\nnow, of course, only in the remote Northwest; but a few beavers survive\r\nin the Rocky Mountain region of the United States, under protective\r\nlaws, and they are still numerous in the more thinly settled parts of\r\nCanada, and furnish a large return to trappers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\n                          MAMMALS OF THE SEA\r\n\r\n\r\nWhale is a general name for the extensive and varied order of marine\r\nmammals termed in science Cetacea. Their origin is obscure, but it is\r\ncertain that their very ancient ancestors were land animals, evidence\r\nof which is afforded by their anatomy, especially in embryonic and very\r\nyoung specimens. Here are classified not only the great true whales\r\nbut their smaller relatives, the sportive dolphins and porpoises, the\r\ngrampuses or blackfish, the white whales often seen in the lower St.\r\nLawrence River, the killers, and such out-of-the-way forms as the\r\nnarwhal, from whose snout projects a long twisted \"tusk,\" which is a\r\nstrangely overgrown incisor tooth. In all these animals the shape is\r\nfishlike, as is required by the fishlike habits; the skin is smooth\r\nand usually blackish, or black with white markings; the forelimbs have\r\nbecome paddles and the tail a pair of horizontal flukes. As they are\r\nmammals with lungs and breathe air, whales must come to the surface\r\nfrequently for that purpose. At the instant they emerge the pent-up\r\nair is expelled from the lungs through the nostrils at the top of the\r\nnose. In the case of the larger species this big discharge of moist\r\nbreath condenses in the cold air into a visible vapor, often mixed with\r\nsea spray, which is called a \"blowing\"; but no water is expelled from\r\nthe mouth, with which the \"blowholes\" have no connection. The smaller\r\nkinds of cetaceans, of which the variety is immense, are in the main\r\nfish-eaters, but the killer seizes and devours porpoises and seals\r\nalso, and a band of them may unite to worry a big cachalot to death.\r\nMost species go about in small bands, or \"schools.\"\r\n\r\nThe great whales are of two distinct families: (1) baleen whales, and\r\n(2) toothed whales. The first take their name from the blade-shaped\r\nplates of horny material (whalebone) hanging, to the number of two or\r\nthree hundred, from the roof of the mouth, each central blade eight or\r\nten feet long in ordinary cases. These \"right\" (i. e., proper) whales,\r\nas they are called by the men who hunt for and harpoon them, are huge\r\ncreatures often fifty to seventy-five feet long, ranging all northern\r\noceans, even amid arctic ice; yet, despite their bulk, they feed\r\nexclusively on the small crustaceans and other minute creatures of the\r\nplankton swept into the mouth by the million as the whale rushes along\r\nthe surface, the water scooped up escaping from the sides of the mouth,\r\nand the food being caught by the fringes of baleen and swallowed like\r\na continuous meal. In addition to the whalebone obtained from these\r\nwhales the hunters cut away and save the thick layer of fat (blubber)\r\nunder the skin for the sake of the oil it yields. The beeflike flesh of\r\nthe muscles is good meat. This kind of whale is becoming very scarce.\r\n\r\nThe toothed whales consist of the single species called sperm whale,\r\nor \"cachalot,\" which is of gigantic size, a lesser cousin (\"kogia\"),\r\nand an inferior genus, the beaked whales of the Antarctic. All are\r\nmore common in the tropics and South Pacific than elsewhere. The great\r\nsperm whale differs in form from a \"right\" one mainly in having\r\na huge, flattopped, almost square-fronted head, beneath which is\r\nhinged a somewhat shorter underjaw. The cavernous mouth is armed with\r\nstrong, pointed teeth, and these whales prey on fish and especially on\r\ncuttlefish. They can swallow whole nothing larger than a salmon, but\r\ncan bite larger prey into manageable pieces, and have more than once\r\nseized and crushed a boat in their jaws. The cachalot attacks the giant\r\nsquid whenever it meets one and the marks of the squid's winding arms\r\nand cruel suckers are often seen on the hides of whales as scars of\r\nsome struggle between these Titans of the deep. The value to mankind\r\nof the sperm whale lies in the liquid fat and the valuable substance,\r\nspermaceti, that fill a vast cavity in the top of its skull, a single\r\nwhale yielding several barrels of it, from which the commercial\r\n\"spermaceti\" and a fine oil are extracted. In their intestines are\r\nfrequently found lumps of the secretion known as \"ambergris,\" used as\r\na base for perfumes, the price of which is so high in the market that\r\na few pounds will cover the expenses of a ship's voyage. Ambergris is\r\nalso found floating in the open sea or cast up on shore, and for a long\r\ntime its origin was unknown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\n                     THE WORLD'S HERDS AND FLOCKS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great tribe of animals called Ungulata (\"hoofed\") or Herbivora\r\n(eaters of herbage--herbivores), combines two types of structure into\r\nwhich they have diverged since their origin at the dawn of the Tertiary\r\nera, namely:\r\n\r\nI. Odd-toed, or solid-hoofed, ungulates (Perissodactyla), typified by\r\nhorses; and\r\n\r\nII. Even-toed, or split-hoofed, ungulates (Artiodactyla), typified by\r\nthe cattle.\r\n\r\nThey exist in every part of the habitable globe except Australasia,\r\nhave furnished sustenance to the larger Carnivora, and have supplied\r\nthe need of man for assistance in his labor, and with materials for\r\nfood, shelter, and clothing. Without them modern civilization would\r\nhave been impossible.\r\n\r\nBoth divisions have lost the plantigrade (flat-soled) walk of their\r\nearly ancestors, and now step on the tips of their toes. This has been\r\ngradually gained as an adaptation to the increase of dry land and the\r\nformation of grassy plains, which we know went on steadily, especially\r\nthrough the last third of the Tertiary era. The short, massive legs\r\nand spreading, five-toed feet, useful in sustaining an animal's weight\r\nin marshes, were slowly changed to longer, more slender limbs and a\r\ndigitigrade walk as greater speed and nimbleness were required in\r\nmaking their way over wide pastures to and from watering places or in\r\nescaping the beasts of prey, which were themselves becoming swifter\r\nand more active in jumping by a coordinate evolution of abilities.\r\nBut before proceeding to the typical hoofed tribes, mention must be\r\nmade of the elephants, which belong in this order. Elephants appear to\r\nstand apart from all other mammals, and from the earliest times have\r\nattracted attention by their huge bulk and strength, and by traditions\r\nof their intelligent performances. They seem a necessary part of\r\nour ideas of Oriental life and grandeur, and a circus without trick\r\nelephants would be a poor show in the eyes of the American youngster.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SOUTHERN MAMMOTH\r\n  Drawn by Christman. (American Museum of Natural History)]\r\n\r\nThe naturalist classifies them (order Proboscidea) in this place\r\nbecause they are plainly, although remotely, related in structure to\r\nthe solid-hoofed browsers; but only recently has he been able to trace\r\ntheir ancestry back to a small, tapirlike forefather of Miocene days,\r\nwith no trunk and no tusks. The trunk, of course, is the animal's\r\nlengthened nose, become an organ useful for many purposes other than\r\nbreathing; and the tusks are overgrown upper incisor teeth. The\r\nelephants of the present time are few compared with those of warmer\r\npast ages, when many species, as well as various cousins, such as\r\nlong-haired mammoths and towering mastodons, wandered over Europe,\r\nAsia, and our own country. Now only two kinds remain: one in Africa,\r\nthe other Asiatic. They differ in many ways, most noticeably in the\r\nsize of the ears, which in the African elephant are very much larger\r\nthan those of the Asiatic species. Both are forest animals, feeding\r\non leaves and twigs. African elephants were formerly to be found all\r\nover the wooded parts of that continent, traveling about in herds that\r\nsometimes numbered a hundred or more individuals; and were varied in\r\nappearance, some being taller than any Oriental one, while others (in\r\nthe Congo region) are so small as to be called dwarfs. The natives have\r\nnever captured and made use of them, and few have been tamed by anyone\r\nwithin recent years, but in the time of the Carthaginians and Romans\r\nthey were held captive, ridden, and employed in war, and in sports of\r\nthe arena. They have been greatly reduced in numbers by ivory hunters,\r\nand would be nearly or quite extinct now had they not been protected in\r\nrecent years by wise laws.\r\n\r\nThe Asiatic, or \"Indian\" elephant, which is confined to India,\r\nCeylon, Burma, and the Malay countries, still roams the jungles as a\r\nwild animal, but every herd is known to and protected by the local\r\ngovernments, and from time to time these are rounded up, and young ones\r\nare captured and trained to man's service. Only in this way can the\r\ndomestic supply be maintained, since these elephants rarely produce\r\nyoung when in captivity. They are utilized as riding and burden-bearing\r\nbeasts, for hauling heavy loads, especially in the army service, and in\r\nhandling large timber and other industrial operations. Some ivory is\r\nobtained from this species, but the tusks are far smaller than those\r\nof the African elephants, and the females bear none at all, while both\r\nsexes are armed in Africa, where an old \"bull's\" tusks have been known\r\nto exceed a weight of 300 pounds each.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PREHISTORIC STRAIGHT-TUSKED ELEPHANT\r\n  Drawn by Christman. (American Museum of Natural History)]\r\n\r\nAlthough there is no reason to suppose the African elephant is less\r\nintelligent by nature than the Oriental one, nearly all the evidence of\r\nthoughtfulness in these animals comes from Indian examples--a species\r\nthat has been studied and educated for hundreds of years. That they may\r\nbe taught to do almost anything of which their bodies are capable is\r\nplain; but undoubtedly they comprehend very largely the purposes of the\r\nman directing them, and use \"brains\" in assisting him to carry them\r\nout. They have retentive memories, appreciate kindness, and constantly\r\nshow skill and discretion in accomplishing what they are asked to do.\r\nIn regard to no other sort of animal has so much been written as of\r\nelephants; and the sum of the testimony is that they are not only very\r\nteachable and faithful in performing their tasks, when not disabled by\r\nfear, but often use surprisingly good judgment in their work.\r\n\r\nDistantly related to the elephants, yet so remote in relationship\r\nto anything else as to be set apart in an order (Hyracoidea) by\r\nthemselves, and with no visible geological ancestry, are the queer\r\nlittle \"conies\" of the Scriptures, called rock rabbits, and dassies\r\nin South Africa. They have a singular resemblance to rabbits, apart\r\nfrom their little round ears, and are more like enlarged copies of\r\nour western pikas, but their anatomy and teeth show they are far from\r\nbeing rodents; and they are classified here mainly by reason of their\r\nrhinoceroslike teeth, and the hooflets on their toes, so that they\r\nform a quaint intermediary between the elephants and the solid-hoofed\r\nsection of the ungulates; they are, indeed, relics of an exceedingly\r\nprimitive and ancestral type of ungulates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WART HOG, ONE OF THE UGLIEST ANIMALS TO SEE\r\n  Photo, Elwin R. Sanborn, N. Y. Zoological Society]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MALAY TAPIR, RELATED TO THE PIG AND THE RHINOCEROS\r\n  Photo, Elwin R. Sanborn, N. Y. Zoological Society]\r\n\r\n\r\n                    RHINOCEROSES, TAPIRS AND HORSES\r\n\r\nIncluded by their general anatomy among the perissodactyls, although\r\nthey have several toes on each foot, all reaching the ground, and, like\r\nthose of elephants, connected by webs and clothed with thick, hooflike\r\nnails, are the rhinoceroses and tapirs. The rhinoceroses are relics\r\nof a long and interesting geological history. Two belong to Africa,\r\none of which, the common \"black,\" browsing rhinoceros, is still\r\nabundant south of the equator in all the more open and less occupied\r\nparts, of the continent; while the other, the larger, square-lipped,\r\ngrass-eating, or \"white\" rhinoceros, has become very rare save in\r\ncertain remote and upland plains. Both have thick, hairless skins of a\r\npale lead-gray, which lie smoothly over the whole body, and both have,\r\non the nose, two horns, composed of matted, whalebonelike hairs, not\r\na part of the skeleton but springing from the skin. The front horn is\r\nalways much the longer, in some cases reaching a length of more than\r\nfifty inches. Asia has three species of rhinoceros, all of which differ\r\nfrom the African in having functional incisor teeth, and in their\r\nhides. The best known is the \"Indian\" rhinoceros, now confined to the\r\nhot jungles of the extreme northeast of India. It has only one horn,\r\nand its dark hide is thrown into heavy folds looking like artificial\r\narmor. It became known to Europe early in the sixteenth century, and\r\nbecame the subject for some of the most curious speculations and\r\nsuperstitions of that credulous age. The \"Sondaic\" or hairy rhinoceros\r\nstill is to be found in jungles from Bengal around to the end of\r\nthe Malayan Peninsula. It is smaller than the Indian one, and its\r\nfolded and tesselated hide supports a coat of short hair; its horns\r\nare only two little protuberances on its nose. Finally Sumatra and\r\nBorneo have a rhinoceros whose coat is still more hairy, and among\r\nwhose peculiarities is the possession of two formidable horns. These\r\ncreatures are perhaps the best examples remaining of what Merck's\r\nrhinoceros (fossil) and other big quadrupeds of the Pleistocene era\r\nlooked like.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARKHOR, AN ASIATIC WILD GOAT]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOUNTAIN SHEEP OR BIGHORN OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS\r\n  Photos, Elwin R. Sanborn, N. Y. Zoological Society]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BROAD-NOSED RHINOCEROS\r\n  Merck's Rhinoceros--prehistoric. Drawn by Christman. (American Museum\r\n  of Natural History)]\r\n\r\nThe tapirs are even more widely separated in habitat than the\r\nrhinoceroses, for four species dwell in the New World between Guatemala\r\nand southern Brazil and Guiana, while the fifth belongs to Malaysia.\r\nThey are forest animals, and mainly browsers, the long, almost\r\ntrunklike nose and lips enabling them to seize and tear off leaves and\r\ntwigs easily. They choose low districts, as a rule, and rush into the\r\nsafety of water when in danger from the jaguar or other beasts. They\r\nare shaped somewhat like a very fat pony, but with a big, pointed head,\r\nand are clothed with short hair of plain dark tints, but the young are\r\nspotted at first. They are timid, secretive and nocturnal in their\r\nhabits. Their flesh is excellent meat.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to the horses, whose geological history is one of the\r\nromances of natural history, as it is traced from the little five-toed\r\neohippus of the Eocene up to the herds that roamed our western\r\nprairies, and disappeared so completely, and so unaccountably, in the\r\nera just preceding the present. Our domestic horses, consequently,\r\nare all of Old World origin. As far back as man can be traced in his\r\nsupposed birthplace in central Asia herds of small horses fed upon\r\nthose high plains; and about fifty years ago bands of ponies were\r\ndiscovered ranging the dreary deserts of Dzungaria, or northwestern\r\nChinese Turkestan, and specimens are now living and breeding in the\r\nZoölogical Park in New York and in European collections. This truly\r\nwild horse stands about ten hands high, and is covered with thick hair\r\nof a dull brown color, unstriped.\r\n\r\nSuch horses were undoubtedly hunted and killed as food by Paleolithic\r\nmen; and when, many, many thousands of years ago, they had in some\r\ndegree domesticated them, and began to migrate southward and westward,\r\nthey took these horses with them. Those people that gradually occupied\r\nPersia, Mesopotamia, and the plains of Arabia and North Africa,\r\ndeveloped them into riding animals that became perfected in what we\r\nknow as the Arabian horse. Those tribes that migrated across Russia\r\nand along to the northern shore of the Mediterranean, found in Europe\r\na similar, but more robust horse, now designated the \"forest\" horse,\r\nwhich the savages regarded as game. The two interbred in the course\r\nof time; but the southern breeds have remained smaller, lighter, and\r\nmore agile, while the northern or forest stock has been the foundation\r\nof the heavy draft horses of northern Europe. After the Crusades Arab\r\nblood was introduced to effect a still further refinement of the horses\r\nof southern Europe, and it was from this Arab-improved stock, prevalent\r\nin Spain, that the horses sent to the Spanish colonies in the Americas\r\nwere derived. Our plains, and the pampas of South America, soon became\r\npopulated with these horses run wild--\"mustangs,\" showing even yet\r\ntraces of their aristocratic lineage.\r\n\r\nSo near to the horses that they belong to the same genus (Equus) are\r\nthe zebras, which differ mainly in their brighter coloring, less bushy\r\ntail, \"roached\" manes, and lack of those callosities called \"chestnuts\"\r\non the hind legs. The zebras are exclusively African, and include two\r\ntypes, a southern and a northern. The true zebra, now extinct, except\r\nwhere kept and bred in captivity, belonged to the mountains near the\r\nCape of Good Hope, was only about twelve hands high, and had black\r\nstripes on a white ground.\r\n\r\nIn the more open parts of Africa, north to Lake Rudolph, roamed\r\nBurchell's variety of this zebra, the one now commonly seen in\r\nmenageries, in which the coat is creamy or golden yellow, and the black\r\nstripes are far broader. Its northern variety, Grevy's zebra, has the\r\nblack stripes narrower, but so much more numerous that the white shows\r\nas mere lines between them. To these must be added an extinct species,\r\nkilled off many years ago by Boer farmers and other sportsmen, which\r\nwas known as the \"quaha\" (quagga) from its barking neigh; it was a dark\r\nbrown, with stripings only on the head and neck.\r\n\r\nThe zebras seem incapable of becoming useful in harness or under the\r\nsaddle, but their very near relatives, the asses--in spite of the sober\r\ngray of their dress, and their ungainly ears--have given us the patient\r\nand enduring donkey, which has been a servant of mankind, at least in\r\nEgypt, ever since the date of the earliest monuments; and wild asses\r\nstill flourish on the deserts of Africa from Algiers to Somaliland.\r\nAnother somewhat larger and more variable species roams the upland\r\nplains of Persia and northern India, while a variety, the \"kiang,\"\r\nlives on the arctic tableland of Tibet, and is as untamable a creature\r\nas can be imagined.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BURCHELL'S ZEBRA OF NORTHERN CENTRAL AFRICA]\r\n\r\n\r\n                        HIPPOS, PIGS AND CAMELS\r\n\r\nWith the hippopotamus we begin the long list of artiodactyls, or\r\ncloven-footed animals, in which the weight of the body rests equally\r\non the two central digits (third and fourth) which are alike in\r\ndevelopment, while the second and fifth digits, when present, do\r\nlittle or no work, except in the hippopotamus, whose outside toes are\r\nas long as the central ones, because needed by an animal treading\r\non muddy soil, and accustomed to swimming. Although this huge marsh\r\ndenizen is now confined to Africa, it ranged into southern Europe and\r\neastward to India within quite recent times, but was destroyed by the\r\nhuman settlement of these countries; and civilization will in due\r\ntime exterminate it from the Congo and Nile basins where it now is so\r\nnumerous, and so incompatible with commerce and industry.\r\n\r\nThe swine are the first artiodactyls to show the typical cloven feet,\r\nand in them the two hind toes reach almost to the ground, so as to\r\nhelp the footing in the soft ground that they frequent. The foremost\r\nmember of the family (Suidæ) is the wild boar of the Old World, known\r\nfrom the North Sea to the Bay of Bengal; and it is hard to realize that\r\nthe fat hogs of our stockyards are modifications of this bristling\r\nforest boar with his muscular form, swift gait, and terrible tusks. Far\r\nmore ugly in appearance, however, is the wart hog of Africa and the\r\nhairless \"babiroussa\" of Celebes, whose upcurved tusks far outmeasure\r\nthose of the Indian boar. America has a family of native swine named\r\npeccaries--small, thin-legged, grizzled-black pigs, with very thick,\r\nbristly necks and large, angular heads. They have wicked little eyes,\r\nrazor-sharp tusks in both jaws, and no visible tails, and the young\r\nare not striped as in the typical Suidæ. These pigs go in companies,\r\nwandering mainly at night in search of food, and taking almost anything\r\nedible. They are irascible, attack with fierce energy in concert, and\r\nare formidable foes to anything afoot, driving even the jaguar up a\r\ntree when the band turns on him. One kind of peccary is common in\r\nsouthwestern Texas, and its roving bands do much damage by night to\r\ncrops and gardens; it is called a \"javelin.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PREHISTORIC HIPPOPOTAMUS\r\n  Drawn by Christman. (American Museum of Natural History)]\r\n\r\nThe swine occupy a somewhat intermediate place between the solid-hoofed\r\nand the split-hoofed sections of the Herbivora; and the stomach is\r\nsimple except in the peccaries, where it takes a complicated form that\r\napproaches that of the ruminants. This simplicity, with the correlated\r\nfact that swine do not chew the cud, enabled the leaders of the ancient\r\nHebrews to set pigs apart, as unclean, by a more general definition\r\nthan a mere name could give, thus leaving no way of escape for those\r\nwho might be inclined to dodge the prohibition by quibbling. All other\r\nHerbivora are ruminants, that is, chewers of the \"cud\"--those that\r\ngather and swallow their food in haste, and then at leisure recover it\r\nand thoroughly rechew it in small quantities (cuds).\r\n\r\nThis strange operation, like the carrying away of food by pocket mice,\r\nmonkeys, etc., enabled these comparatively defenseless animals to\r\ngather nutriment in a short time and then retreat to a safe place to\r\nprepare it for digestion. Associated with this practice is a large,\r\ncomplicated stomach, normally consisting of four chambers, into the\r\nfirst and largest of which the hastily swallowed forage is first\r\nreceived. Then, when swallowed a second time, it passes on into the\r\nsecond or true stomach, where real digestion begins.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE KUDU, OR STRIPED ANTELOPE OF AFRICA; AT THE RIGHT,\r\n  HEAD OF THE GREATER SABLE ANTELOPE\r\n  Photos, Elwin R.

The fact that in their metapodial bones they resemble the\r\nstructure of camels causes these apparently so distant animals to be\r\nplaced next to camels in classification.\r\n\r\nThe history of the camels (Camelidæ) is very similar to that of the\r\nhorse. The family originated in North America, where it developed\r\nfrom little creatures, by changes and adaptations to a life on dry\r\nuplands, as did the horses, into a species which in the Pleistocene was\r\na third larger than any now living. Meanwhile camels had made their\r\nway over the land which in the later Tertiary connected Alaska with\r\nSiberia, into the high plains of Asia, where the camels found favorable\r\ncircumstances and developed into the two species we know. Others\r\nmigrated, earlier in the family history, into South America, where they\r\nceased to grow tall after the camel model, but became the huanacos\r\nof Patagonia, of which the llamas (yah-mas) are prehistorically\r\ndomesticated descendants, and into the woolly vicuñas of the Andean\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LLAMA\r\n  (_Lama peruviana_)\r\n  A domesticated animal of South America]\r\n\r\nModern camels are of two kinds--the single-humped and the\r\ndouble-humped. The latter, or \"Bactrian,\" is confined to Asia, and is\r\nable to endure the cold and snows of the tablelands of that continent,\r\nwhere its burdens are carried in winter as well as summer. What was\r\nthe extent to which the single-humped, or ordinary camel, ranged\r\nbefore its prehistoric enslavement by men, we do not know--if it\r\nroamed the deserts of Arabia and northern Africa as well as those of\r\nTurkestan, no evidence of it remains. A few small-sized, gaunt, wary,\r\nand swift-footed camels still run wild among the almost inaccessible\r\nsand dunes of the Gobi Desert, but it is not certain that they are\r\nrelics of the original wild stock. At any rate the camels have always\r\nbeen creatures of the world's waste places, and all their quaint\r\npeculiarities such as their sole pads and the water-storing sacs in\r\ntheir stomachs (rumens) are adaptations to their desert home.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BACTRIAN CAMEL\r\n  (_Camelus bactrianus_)\r\n  The two-humped camel of Asia]\r\n\r\nThe deer family (Cervidæ) is of great extent, and world-wide in its\r\ndistribution, except that it is entirely absent from Africa and\r\nAustralia. In none are more than two toes of use in walking, the\r\nsecond and fifth toes hanging at some distance behind and above the\r\nfunctional hoofs, which are narrow and pointed. All have slender, long\r\nlegs, giving swiftness and great leaping power; and very short tails,\r\nwith the exception of the rare and peculiar David's deer of China,\r\nwhose tail is almost like that of a cow. The coat of hair is short and\r\nbrittle, reddish brown or foxy in summer, grayer in winter, in some\r\nspecies plain, or spotted only when fawns, in others variegated with\r\nsmall, whitish spots. The distinctive badge of the family, however,\r\nis the pair of horns borne on the heads of the males (also by females\r\nin the reindeer and caribou), collectively and more properly called\r\n\"antlers,\" since they are not composed of horn, but of true bony\r\nmaterial. They are poised on two protuberances on the top of the skull,\r\nwhere in spring arises a growth of fleshy material, covered with\r\nvelvety hair, that rapidly takes the shape of the antler characteristic\r\nof the species (and age) of the deer, and as it grows is filled with\r\nlime salts that gradually replace all the tissues. Then the \"velvet\"\r\ndries and scales off and the ivorylike antler emerges. This remains as\r\na serviceable weapon and ornament of the buck until the beginning of\r\nwinter, when its attachment to the skull loosens, and the antler drops\r\noff. This happens annually in the case of all deer--one of the common\r\nand universal facts in zoölogy that many find it hard to believe. The\r\n\"horns\" of the various deer vary in size from short and simple \"spikes\"\r\nto the wide-branching antlers of the moose and wapiti; but these last\r\nare acquired only when the buck is fully matured, the yearling showing\r\nonly a spike, and acquiring branches (\"tines\") one by one annually as\r\nhe grows until his proper complement is reached; but in a few small\r\nspecies no branching ever occurs.\r\n\r\nThe family contains many genera and species, but only the most\r\nnoticeable can be mentioned. The most familiar one, probably, is the\r\nsmall, spotted fallow deer of southern Europe, bands of which ornament\r\nthe parks of grand estates in Great Britain and on the continent;\r\nits antlers broaden at the end into the form known as \"palmated,\" on\r\naccount of its resemblance to an open hand with fingers. Even more\r\ncelebrated in song and story is the red deer, the males of which are\r\n\"stags\" and the females \"hinds.\" These are large, dark, reddish brown\r\nanimals, with grandly symmetrical antlers, every tine or \"point\"\r\non which--seven on each side in a \"full head\"--has its name in the\r\nlanguage of hunting. This deer, still wild in the highlands of Scotland\r\nand in the mountainous forests of eastern Europe, is also to be found\r\nright across Asia, where local varieties go by the names of \"maral\" in\r\nnorthern Persia, \"hangul\" in Kashmir, and so on to eastern Siberia,\r\nwhere far taller species live than are known to Europe; and all vary in\r\nminor particulars only from our wapiti--which it is fair to regard as\r\nof the same stock.\r\n\r\nNone of all these stags is more stately than the American wapiti--the\r\n\"elk\" of all western men--which once abounded from the Adirondacks\r\nand southern Alleghenies to California and the borders of Alaska.\r\nEverywhere of old it was plentiful and easy to kill, and the pioneers\r\nswiftly destroyed it as civilization was pushed westward, until its\r\nmighty herds have vanished almost as completely as those of the bison.\r\nIt thrived anywhere and everywhere, climbing the wooded heights of\r\nthe Appalachians (where the very last one was killed near Ridgway,\r\nPennsylvania, in 1869), loafing in the warm, well-watered valleys of\r\nthe Mississippi basin, herding in the sun-baked plains, or scrambling\r\nup and down the roughest of western sierras. Equally broad in its\r\nappetite, those that browsed or ate mast and fruits in the eastern\r\nwoods did no better than those which grazed on the bunch-grass plateaus\r\nfrom the Rio Grande to Peace River; and in winter it would keep fat\r\nwhere other deer or cattle might starve, because able to paw through\r\nthe snow to the dried grass.\r\n\r\nThe other round-horned deer of the United States are the familiar\r\nVirginian, white-tailed, or willow deer, which is to be found all over\r\nthe country, and in similar species in Mexico and Central America; the\r\nlarger black-tailed, long-eared \"mule deer,\" or \"jumping deer,\" of the\r\nplains and the foothills of the Rocky Mountain region, and the small,\r\nforest-keeping, black-tail, or Columbian deer of Oregon and northward.\r\n\r\nCanada, Alaska, and the northern parts of Maine and Minnesota, are\r\nthe refuge of that biggest of all the deer, which we call by the\r\nIndian name \"moose,\" but which is known to Europeans as \"elk,\" for it\r\nis a circumpolar species that once roamed in great numbers through\r\nthe woods of all Europe, and in this country far southward along the\r\nAppalachians. Until the World War the elk was preserved in certain\r\nlarge forests of Lithuania and central Russia, but it is doubtful if\r\nany survived the desolation of that region during and after the war.\r\nThe moose is everywhere a forest-ranging animal, especially fond of\r\nregions where rivers and lakes abound, in which it finds desirable\r\nfood in summer and takes much pleasure; yet in the mountainous West it\r\noften climbs to high and dry heights. Its principal diet is leaves and\r\ntwigs, pulled off by the long, flexible lips that are so characteristic\r\na feature. The moose is a huge, immensely strong and ungainly animal,\r\nblackish brown with pale legs and belly, and with a neck so short that\r\nit can graze only by kneeling. A very large bull may stand six and\r\na half to seven feet high at the withers, which, with the neck, are\r\nclothed in a thick mantle of long, coarse, stiff hair; and from the\r\nthroat hangs a long hairy strip of dew-lap skin (the \"bell\"), which\r\nin old age draws up into a sort of pouch. The long and narrow head\r\nends in an overhanging, flexible muzzle, that may be curled around a\r\ntwig like a proboscis. On this massive head and neck the bulls carry\r\na wonderful pair of flattened antlers, always surprisingly wide in\r\nspread, but varying greatly in weight, and that irrespective of the\r\nrelative bigness of the animal. The moose of the Kenai Peninsula,\r\nAlaska, are famous for the immensity and complication of their horns;\r\none pair preserved in the Field Columbian Museum, Chicago, have a\r\nspread of seventy-eight and a half inches, show thirty-four points,\r\nmeasure fifteen inches around the burr, and with the dry skull weigh\r\nninety-three pounds; but very few reach such dimensions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REINDEER CROSSING A STREAM\r\n  From a prehistoric engraving on an antler found in southern France]\r\n\r\nAnother flat-horned deer is the famous reindeer of the boreal regions\r\nof both hemispheres, for our arctic caribou are the same animals\r\nunder another name. No truly wild reindeer now exist in the Old World,\r\nbut they are scattered over all the Barren Grounds, or treeless coast\r\nareas and islands, from Greenland to Alaska; and the Eskimos depend\r\non them not only for food to some extent, but even more for clothing\r\nand tentage. Every autumn enormous herds of these caribou, gathered in\r\nmigration, sweep southward to less frigid and snowy feeding grounds in\r\nthe region between Hudson Bay and Great Slave Lake, and there enable\r\nthe Indians to provide themselves with meat and skins for the winter.\r\nThese arctic caribou feed mainly on the lichen called \"reindeer moss.\"\r\nAnother kind, the \"woodland\" caribou, inhabits the uncivilized forest\r\nborders south of the Barren Grounds, and the mountain region from\r\nBritish Columbia to the arctic shore of Alaska and Yukon; and in the\r\neast occurs in Ungava, Labrador, Newfoundland, and New Brunswick. They\r\nare not regularly migratory, but wander in small herds, prefer swampy\r\nwoods, and their habits approach those of the moose. There is no great\r\ndifference otherwise between them and the arctic caribou; but they vary\r\na good deal, so that several species have been named among those of the\r\nwest, one of which, in Alaska, is quite white.\r\n\r\nSoutheastern Asia has many kinds of deer, such as the large staglike\r\nsambar of India and eastward; the spotted axis, or chital; the sika of\r\nJapan; and a variety of small Oriental species exist.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OKAPI\r\n  (_Okapia johnstoni_)\r\n  A relative of the giraffe, found in the forests of Africa]\r\n\r\nThe giraffes of equatorial Africa (family Giraffidæ) are closely\r\nrelated to the deer. They are hornless, but from the top of the skull\r\nproject two protuberances, several inches in length, which answer to\r\nthe horn-cores of the deer, but carry no antlers, and are permanently\r\ncovered with hairy skin; between them is a third shorter protuberance\r\nof the skull. A few years ago it was discovered that there existed in\r\nthe dense forests of the lower Congo valley an animal of this family,\r\nbut smaller and more antelopelike in body, and without the towering\r\ncharacteristics of the giraffe, called by the Pygmies of that district\r\n\"okapi\" or \"o'api.\" It is chestnut in color, with yellowish cheeks and\r\nthe legs marked with wavy, whitish stripes. It is perhaps not rare, but\r\nis exceedingly difficult to obtain in the dense jungle it inhabits.\r\n\r\nTwo singular animals remain to be mentioned here, as standing\r\nintermediate between the deer and the cattle family, next to be\r\nconsidered. One of these is the musk deer of the Himalayas, from\r\nwhich is taken the \"pod,\" or ventral gland, that contains the odorous\r\nsubstance \"musk.\" This is a strange, old-fashioned, solitary little\r\ncreature, the size of a half-grown kid, and having very large ears,\r\nalmost no tail, and no horns, but wearing a pair of keen weapons in the\r\nlong upper canines which hang well down below the lower jaw. The four\r\ntoes of the feet are almost equal, and the hoofs so free that they can\r\nfairly grasp any projection, so that the animal is a marvel of agility\r\nand surefootedness.\r\n\r\nOur American pronghorn \"antelope\" is the second of these intermediate\r\nanimals, and is not far removed in its structure from our white\r\nmountain goat. It foreshadows the sheathed-horned ruminants, but\r\ndiffers from all of them in the fact that its horns bear a prong, and\r\nalso in that they are periodically shed and renewed. This beautiful\r\nand graceful little animal, truly antelopelike in form and habit,\r\nstands about three feet high at the shoulder, has slender legs and\r\nfeet, with no false hoofs, and is exceedingly swift in its bounding\r\ngait. It is now almost gone from the wide plains where only a few\r\nyears ago it was to be seen in summer from the Saskatchewan to the Rio\r\nGrande and southward. In the autumn it would gather in the North into\r\never-increasing herds that swept southward to pass the winter in Texas\r\nand New Mexico, and then would return northward with the advance of\r\nspring. The extension of fenced ranching, but most of all the spanning\r\nof the plains by railroads, rapidly put an end to these migrations, and\r\nthe wasteful killing of the pronghorns in sport, or as food, completed\r\nthe virtual extermination of one of the most interesting and desirable\r\nanimals of the New World.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\n                     SOME SUPREMELY USEFUL ANIMALS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fact that likeness of structure, which compels naturalists to group\r\ncertain animals into a family in spite of possible unlikeness in size\r\nor form, is accompanied by resemblance in quality, is well illustrated\r\nby the family Bovidæ (Latin _boves_, \"cattle\") which includes goats,\r\nsheep, antelopes, and oxen; for all of these in flesh, products\r\nand disposition, are alike suited to the requirements of men, and\r\nespecially of mankind in a social civilization. This family of animals\r\nfurnishes us with nearly all of our milk, butter, and cheese; with\r\nflesh food, woolen clothing, leather goods, horn, gelatin, etc.: and\r\ngives us such servants as the ox and goat; while sportsmen find in it\r\nthe most fascinating of their larger game.\r\n\r\nThe distinctive feature of this most useful of animal tribes is the\r\npossession of hollow horns, properly so called. Horn is a chitinous\r\nmaterial developed from the skin, and not dissimilar to hair; indeed\r\nit would be no great stretch of facts to say that a cow's horn was\r\ncomposed of agglutinated hairs. These horns are sheaths that grow over\r\ncores of bone--outgrowths of the skull--increase in size until their\r\nwearers are mature, grow at the base as fast as worn at the tips, and\r\nare never shed. They may be borne by the males alone, or by both sexes;\r\nor the males may have horns far larger than those of the female, as\r\nin the sheep; and in a few cases both sexes are hornless. No family\r\nis more difficult to subdivide, for the various forms intergrade\r\ninextricably.\r\n\r\nOur mountain goat, or \"mazama,\" which dwells on the snowy heights of\r\nthe Pacific Coast ranges, from southern British Columbia to farthest\r\nAlaska, is one of these intermediate ones, suggesting both goat and\r\nantelope in its make-up. It is about the size of an ordinary domestic\r\ngoat, has small, sharp, black horns, and is clothed in long white hair\r\nwith an undercoat of wool fitting it for the wintry cold in which its\r\nlife is spent, for except in midwinter it never comes below timber\r\nline, and even then avoids the wooded places. In the rough mountains\r\nof Japan lives a similar goat antelope, woolly, but not white; and the\r\nlofty heights of western China is the home of a smaller one, the goral,\r\nand the Himalayas have the big serow. All these have short, sharp horns\r\nrising from the top of the skull. Their nearest western neighbor is the\r\nfamous chamois of the Alps and Carpathians of Europe. The extraordinary\r\nagility of these mountaineers is possible because of the pads beneath\r\ntheir hoofs that give them the clinging surefootedness which is so\r\nremarkable.\r\n\r\nMost closely allied to them, probably, are the goats, also denizens of\r\nmountain regions, the typical species being confined to the highlands\r\nbetween the Caucasus and northwestern India. This is the true goat from\r\nwhich the domestic goat is descended; but the long-haired \"Angora\"\r\ngoat is derived from the markhor, a sheeplike animal of the Himalayas\r\nwith tall, much twisted horns. One of the special characteristics of\r\nthe goats (genus Capra) is the beard of the rams; and this feature\r\nbelongs also to the ibexes, several similar species of which are\r\nfound from the Pyrenees eastward along the mountain tops to northern\r\nChina, each occupying a limited section of country, and one inhabiting\r\nthe mountains about the head of the Red Sea. That of Spain is called\r\n\"bouquetin,\" and that of the Alps \"steinbok.\" All the rams possess\r\ngreat horns, sometimes fifty inches long, that rise from the occiput,\r\ncurve backward, and show on their fronts a series of prominent cross\r\nridges. One passes from these goats to their near relatives, the sheep,\r\nby way of the \"bharal\" (or \"burrel\") which combines the characteristics\r\nof the two sections so thoroughly that the proverbial \"separating\r\nthe sheep from the goats,\" easy enough on the farm, is practically\r\nimpossible among wild flocks. In this crag-loving wanderer the horns\r\nof the rams are as long as those of an ibex, but roundish and wide\r\nspreading, instead of upright and cross-ridged. The \"aoudad,\" whose\r\nhome is in the mountains of Morocco and Algiers, and which is familiar\r\nin menageries, has such horns, but approaches nearer in other respects\r\nto the typical sheep, whose rams carry the great spiral horns at the\r\nside of the head, that are still the pride of our domestic merinos, and\r\nwere the badge of the Theban god of gods, Ra Ammon. No better example\r\nof these magnificent mountaineers, which under one or another of\r\nseveral specific and local names, such as argali, oorial, etc., are, or\r\nwere, to be found on rough highlands all the way from the Mediterranean\r\nto Bering Sea, can be shown than our own \"bighorn\" sheep of the Rocky\r\nMountains, and of the mountains of Canada and Alaska.\r\n\r\nNow we come to the great and beautiful section of the antelopes,\r\nin which naturalists recognize thirty-five genera and perhaps a\r\nhundred species. Antelopes were scattered in Pleistocene days all over\r\ncontinental Europe and Asia, but never were present in America, for\r\nour so-called \"antelope\" is a pronghorn, as has been explained. Two or\r\nthree species now inhabit the plains of central Asia--among them the\r\nswiftest mammal known, the Mongolian \"orongo.\" The ungainly \"nilgai\"\r\nand the little \"black buck\" are familiar in India, and the pretty\r\ndorcas gazelle races across the sands of Syria and Arabia; but the\r\nvast majority of antelopes belong to Africa. They range in size from\r\nthe duikerboks, not much bigger than fox terriers, to the eland, which\r\nhas almost the bulk of an ox, and should be domesticated, like beef\r\ncattle, for its excellent flesh. No handsomer mammals than antelopes\r\nexist, judged by either form or coloring. They inhabit all sorts of\r\ncountry, too, as in other lands do the deer, of which Africa has none.\r\nDeserts, such as the Sahara and the Kalahari, and the stony steppes\r\nof Somaliland, support not only the swift and agile gazelles, but\r\nseveral large kinds. The grassy plains of South Africa were formerly,\r\nand to some extent still are, the pastures of great herds of such\r\nantelopes, large and small, as blesboks, wildebeests (or \"gnus\"),\r\nhartebeests, steinboks, springboks, and many others. Springboks used to\r\nassemble at certain seasons, and migrate across the veldt in countless\r\nthousands, allowing nothing to stop the headlong rush of the host. The\r\nthick jungle is the refuge of the harnessed antelopes, and of several\r\ndiminutive kinds rarely seen in the open; and along the watercourses,\r\nand in marshes, live the big red waterbucks, the shy sitatungas, whose\r\nfeet are curiously modified to fit them to walk on boggy ground; while\r\nrocky hills are the chosen home of the klipspringers and duikerboks,\r\nagile pygmies that creep about among the brush like big rabbits, or\r\nleap from rock to rock like miniature goats. A score or more of the\r\nspecies of these beautiful creatures have been carelessly or wantonly\r\nexterminated, and many others have become rare, but protective laws are\r\nnow in force in all the parts of Africa controlled by the Government of\r\nSouth Africa, or organized as British, French, or Belgian dependencies.\r\n\r\nThe quaint and complex musk ox, a lone relic of a past era now exiled\r\nto the remotest north, is a connecting link between the sheep and\r\nthe cattle, the last and best of the ruminants. Here, as elsewhere,\r\nthe style of the horns is characteristic of the group--slender,\r\nbackward curved or twisted, and somewhat compressed or keeled, in most\r\nantelopes; heavy, cross-ridged, triangular in section and often spiral\r\nin the sheep and goats; rough and helmetlike in the musk ox and some\r\nbuffaloes; and in the oxen round, smooth and always springing from\r\nthe side of the skull. The cattle fall into three groups: buffaloes,\r\nbisons, and oxen.\r\n\r\nThe buffaloes are tropical cattle, usually heavily built, with massive,\r\nflattened, wrinkled horns, and the hair so thin that in old animals the\r\nbluish black skin is left almost naked. The typical buffalo is that\r\nnative to India and Ceylon, where it formerly roved in herds, which,\r\nquickly forming into a compact bunch, heads and horns out, defied\r\nattack from even the lion or tiger. Bulls often exceed five feet in\r\nheight, are extremely strong and quick, and carry rough horns, sweeping\r\nback circularly, which may measure twelve feet around the curve. Such\r\na veteran herdmaster spends his days wallowing in marshy jungles, his\r\nbroad, splayed hoofs sustaining him in the muddy soil, and his hairless\r\nback, coated with clay, proof against insects; but evenings and\r\nmornings he leads his band out to feed in lush prairies where the grass\r\nis tall enough to hide them. This is the race that has supplied the\r\nworking cattle of hot, swampy regions, especially where rice is grown,\r\nand that has been the farmer's servant in the Far East, in Egypt, and\r\nin parts of Spain and Italy from time immemorial. Several breeds have\r\nbeen developed, of which the best known to Americans is the carabao of\r\nthe Philippines. Africa has native buffaloes in two species, neither of\r\nwhich has been domesticated. The African buffalo is regarded as perhaps\r\nthe most dangerous brute a sportsman can meet in that land of irritable\r\nbeasts. Only rarely will even the lion attack one single-handed, and\r\nthen seldom succeeds.\r\n\r\nThe bisons, although regarded by systemists as of two species, the\r\nNorth American \"buffalo\" and the European \"wissent,\" are as nearly\r\nalike as well can be. The latter originally ranged over all Europe, and\r\nwas necessarily a forest animal, and hence never could assemble into\r\nherds as did its American cousins. It has been protected on the Czar's\r\nand other great estates in Lithuania and Russia, to the number of about\r\n700; but these preserves were ravaged during and after the World War.\r\nThe wanton waste that swept away the millions of our American bison\r\nin a few short years would long ago have exterminated this species\r\nalso had it not been preserved in bands here and there in the West\r\nand in various animal collections. The peculiarity of the bison is\r\nthe massive, humplike strength of the fore quarters, the great mop of\r\nhair upon them and about the head, and the short, stout horns growing\r\nstraight out of the side of the head.\r\n\r\nThe animal called \"bison\" by sportsmen in India is the gaur, one of\r\nfour species of true oxen inhabiting southeastern Asia--heavy animals\r\nwith massive, upcurved horns, a long, ridgelike spine, short tail, and\r\nfine, glossy, dark-colored hair. A big bull of the gaur or \"sladang,\"\r\nas Malays call it, will stand six feet tall at the shoulders, and is\r\none of the greatest game animals of the world in every sense of the\r\nword. Celebes has a curious dwarf ox, the \"anoa,\" which is hardly\r\nbigger than a goat. Contrasted with this is the great ungainly yak of\r\nTibet and the high Himalayas, where it still wanders in a wild state,\r\nalthough large herds are kept by the Tibetans as beasts of burden\r\nin a region where hardly any other large grazer can exist. Finally,\r\nthe Orient is the home of an extraordinary race of ancient domestic\r\nanimals, the white, humped cattle of India, of which many breeds exist,\r\nmodified by local conditions and purposes, and prehistorically used in\r\nEgypt and probably southward. No wild animals of its kind exist, and we\r\nknow nothing of the origin of the race.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the most interesting species of the family, now extinct\r\nas a wild animal, but perfectly traceable--the primitive wild ox of\r\nEurope, the original of our farm cattle. It was much larger than any\r\nmodern breed, and bore immense, wide-spreading horns, as still do\r\ncertain coarse breeds in southern Europe, and especially in Spain,\r\nwhence the herds of long-horned cattle of America were derived.\r\nOld bulls were black, but there is reason to suspect that the cows\r\nand calves may have been red. This great animal roamed throughout\r\nEurope and western Asia, and was counted among the fiercest of\r\ngame in Cæsar's time, who found it called \"ur,\" or \"aurochs\"; the\r\nformer word was Latinized as _urus_, and the latter, when this ox had\r\ndisappeared, became transferred to the bison. Even in Roman times the\r\nwild ox was growing scarce, and it died out early in the seventeenth\r\ncentury. Meanwhile, from prehistoric days, calves have been tamed by\r\nthe peasantry, and such cattle as Europe and the Mediterranean basin\r\ngenerally possessed were until quite recently little better than rough\r\ndescendants of this captured stock.\r\n\r\nThe so-called \"wild white cattle\" preserved in various British parks\r\nare, according to Lydekker, albino descendants of the tamed native\r\nblack aurochs stock, of unknown antiquity, and are kept white (with\r\nblackish or reddish ears and muzzles) by weeding out the dark-colored\r\ncalves which occasionally appear; but do not represent the original\r\naurochs as well as do the Welsh breed preserved in Pembroke since\r\nprehistoric days. These park cattle are all of moderate size, elegantly\r\nshaped, with soft hair, white, black-tipped horns of moderate length,\r\nand many wild traits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\n                     BEASTS OF PREY--THE CARNIVORA\r\n\r\n\r\n\"One of the most striking and significant results of the study of the\r\nlater Mesozoic and earliest Tertiary mammalian faunas,\" remarks Prof.\r\nW. B. Scott, \"is that the higher or placental mammals are seen to be\r\nconverging back to a common ancestral group of clawed and carnivorous\r\nor omnivorous animals, now entirely extinct, to which the name of\r\nCreodonta was given by Cope. The creodonts are assuredly the ancestors\r\nof the modern flesh-eaters, and, very probably, of the great series of\r\nhoofed animals also, as well as of other orders. From this central,\r\nancestral group the other orders proceed, diverging more and more with\r\nthe progress of time, each larger branch dividing and subdividing into\r\nsmaller and smaller branches, until the modern condition is attained.\"\r\n\r\nThe story of the creodonts--savage marauders large and small--includes\r\nthe rise of the powerful order Carnivora--the beasts of prey, whose\r\nfood is the flesh of other animals. There always has been, and always\r\nwill be in every department and rank of animal life, some or many\r\nspecies that live by preying on their neighbors; and every living\r\nthing, from monad to man, has to fear such enemies.\r\n\r\nThe essential characteristic of the Carnivores is the dentition, which\r\nis adapted to seizing, holding, biting, and cutting. The canines,\r\nrarely prominent in other groups, here become of prime importance--a\r\ndagger and hook in one--a tearing instrument. Naturally this tooth is\r\nmost developed in the dogs and the bears, which have little other means\r\nof seizing and holding an animal, whereas the cat has efficient aid\r\nin its claws. The cheek teeth in this order are (typically) not flat\r\n\"grinders\" but angular and knife-edged, especially the foremost molars\r\nthat shut past one another like scissor blades; and it is evident that\r\nsuch teeth are necessary to animals that must cut their food into\r\npieces small enough to swallow, and are not concerned about chewing it.\r\nThe order contains two distinct divisions, namely:\r\n\r\n    _Marine Carnivores_--Seals, sea lions, walruses.\r\n    _Land Carnivores_--Cats, dogs, weasels, bears, etc.\r\n\r\nThe marine carnivores (suborder Pinnipedia, \"fin-footed\") have their\r\nwhole organization adapted to an aquatic life, and appear to have\r\nacquired it almost from the beginning of the diverse specialization\r\nthat sprang from the generalized creodonts, for nothing is known of\r\ntheir ancestry that connects them with the known lineage of their kin\r\non land. The body approaches a fishlike form, and the four limbs are\r\nturned into more or less perfect paddles, or \"flippers.\" The teeth are\r\nof the carnivorous type; the eyes are always large and prominent; and\r\nexternal ears are lacking except in one family.\r\n\r\nThe least modified of the three families of marine carnivora is that\r\nof the eared seals--the sea lions and fur seals of the North Pacific\r\nocean, and southward to Cape Horn. They have kept much independence of\r\naction in the hind limbs, and are able to climb readily about the rocks\r\nof the islands and shores to which they resort in midsummer for the\r\nbirth of the young. They have an obvious neck, small external ears,\r\nnostrils at the tip of the snout, and in general more characteristics\r\nlike those of land carnivores, especially the bears, than have any\r\nother pinnipeds. They live wholly on fish. Several species termed \"sea\r\nlions\" were formerly numerous from Oregon southward to Patagonia, and\r\non certain South Sea islands, but they have been all but exterminated\r\nexcept in California. These southern species, dwelling in warmer\r\nlatitudes, are known as \"hair\" seals, because their coat lacks the warm\r\nundercoat of the northern species (_Otaria ursina_) which is the \"fur\"\r\nseal of commerce, and which would long ago have disappeared had it not\r\nbeen placed under international protection in its breeding places on\r\nislands in Bering Sea. Thither, as summer opens the ice, gather the\r\nherds that have been wandering in the ocean during the winter. The\r\nfemales are much the more numerous of the two sexes, and having spread\r\nall over the islands, formerly in hundreds of thousands, are collected\r\ninto \"harems.\" The \"bulls\" are three times the size of any of the\r\nfemales, and there are incessant combats between rival bulls. The young\r\nborn here are strong enough to swim away with their mothers in the\r\nearly autumn.\r\n\r\nSimilar in general organization, and in the freedom and usefulness\r\nof the hinder limbs for creeping on land or ice, are the walruses\r\n(Trichechidæ), of which there are two arctic species, one in the North\r\nAtlantic, and one in the seas of Alaska and Kamchatka. In old times\r\nthey came as far south in winter as Nova Scotia and the coasts of\r\nBritain. A full-grown male walrus is a very bulky animal, ten to twelve\r\nfeet long, and his skin is covered with a short coat of hair that in\r\nold age almost disappears, while his bulldoglike muzzle bristles with\r\nquill-like whiskers. The especial feature of the walrus, however, is\r\nthe pair of great ivory tusks, often two feet or more long, which are\r\nthe canines of the upper jaw. They are the tools with which the animal\r\ndigs from the mud of the bottom the clams and other shellfish on which\r\nit feeds, and are formidable weapons enabling it to protect itself and\r\nits family and mates, for which the walrus shows remarkable affection\r\nand loyalty, from the attacks of the polar bear, the only enemy besides\r\nman that it has to fear.\r\n\r\nThe true seals (Phocidæ) have become still further specialized toward\r\na completely aquatic life. Their hind limbs are extended straight\r\nbehind the body, and take no part in progression, the fore flippers\r\nalone enabling them to swim and dive with ease and speed. Their strong,\r\nclawlike nails enable them to climb onto ice floes or the shore, to\r\nwhich they resort for rest and sunshine and to bear their young. These\r\nare usually only one, or at most two, at a birth, and in some species\r\nthey have to be carefully taught how to swim, fearing the water.\r\nAll of the many kinds of seals of this family are confined to the\r\nnorthern hemisphere, and mostly to the arctic region; but the great sea\r\nelephant, now almost extinct, lived in the antarctic, with one colony\r\non the coast of southern California. Most seals are gregarious, and\r\nsome congregate in immense herds on ice floes far from land, but the\r\nmajority of species stay near shore. Seals feed chiefly on fish, of\r\nwhich they consume enormous quantities; some, however, subsist largely\r\non crustaceans, especially prawns that swarm in the northern seas; also\r\non mollusks, echinoderms, and even occasionally on sea birds.\r\n\r\nWe are now ready to turn to the land carnivores, which, by the larger\r\nopportunity, better food, and varied conditions the land affords, have\r\nadvanced far beyond their marine cousins. In these more favorable\r\ncircumstances, and by their struggle for a living against the powers\r\nof defense or escape of their intended prey, and the competition of\r\none another, they have become widely diversified in organization and\r\nhabits, and in some of their representatives have developed the highest\r\nintellectual and physical ability in the animal kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n                BEARS, DOGS, WOLVES, FOXES AND JACKALS\r\n\r\nThe bears (Ursidæ) stand lowest in the scale of rank among the\r\nCarnivora because they retain more than the others archaic\r\ncharacteristics in their anatomy. The family is singularly\r\nuniform--that is, all bears are much alike in their heavy bodies, broad\r\nheads, powerful limbs with \"plantigrade\" feet, resting the whole sole\r\non the ground (whereas most other quadrupeds are \"digitigrade,\" i. e.,\r\nstanding on their toes), and an extremely short tail, almost invisible\r\nin the coat of long hair that clothes their bodies. Distinction into\r\nspecies has been found difficult. An English naturalist once exclaimed\r\nthat he knew but two in the whole world--the polar bear for one and all\r\nthe rest for the other. At the other extreme the American systemist,\r\nDr. C. Hart Merriam, announced in 1918 that the American brown and\r\ngrizzly bears alone were divisible into eighty-eight species and\r\nsubspecies, based on variations in their skulls! For ordinary readers\r\nall the big brown bears of Japan, Asia, Europe, and Canada, inclusive\r\nof the grizzlies (of which few now remain) may be regarded as one\r\nspecies; the polar bear, with its elongated head and body, and\r\npure, white fur, as another; the small gray \"glacier\" bear of the St.\r\nElias Alps in Alaska as another; the \"blue\" one of Tibet, the shaggy,\r\nlong-lipped, sloth bear of India, and the miniature sun bear of Borneo,\r\nas three more; and finally the common yellowish-nosed American black\r\nbears, the Andean \"spectacled\" bear, and the very similar black bears\r\nof the Himalayas, as together constituting a seventh species.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WOLVES IN WESTERN NORTH AMERICA\r\n  Copyright, Underwood & Underwood]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BEAR IN A ROCKY MOUNTAIN FOREST\r\n  Copyright, Underwood & Underwood]\r\n\r\nAll these are as alike in habits, allowing for different surroundings\r\nand food supply, as in appearance. Eating everything from nuts,\r\nberries, and insects, to fish, ground squirrels, and big game, their\r\ndentition comprises not only powerful canines, but molars capable of\r\nsmashing bones. Bears are too slow and clumsy, however, to do much as\r\nbig game hunters, save, perhaps, the polar giant in seizing seals, and\r\nit is therefore necessity rather than choice that reduces these really\r\nformidable beasts to the petty business of nibbling berry bushes,\r\ndigging up bulbs or the nests of wasps and gophers, and tearing rotten\r\nlogs to pieces in hope of finding ants and beetle grubs. The most\r\ninveterate insect hunter of the tribe is the Indian sloth, or honey\r\nbear. Sir Samuel Baker remarks that its favorite delicacy is termites,\r\nfor which it will scratch a large hole in the hardest soil to the\r\ndepth of two or three feet. \"The claws of the forepaws are three or\r\nfour inches in length, and are useful implements for digging. It is\r\nastonishing to see the result upon soil that would require a pickax to\r\nexcavate a hole.\" Having reached the large combs at the bottom of the\r\ncavity the bear blows the dust away with a strong puff, and then draws\r\nthe honey and larvæ out of the comb into its mouth by sucking in its\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\nNevertheless bears eat a good many young and small animals, and in\r\nthe neighborhood of farms steal many calves, colts, and pigs. It is\r\nan animal to be feared by men when met, although as a rule bears are\r\ninclined to run away rather than resist, except when a she-bear feels\r\nthat her young are in danger. Bears are rather solitary, the males\r\nwandering about alone, the females accompanied by cubs often as big\r\nas themselves. The young, two as a rule, are born in midwinter in the\r\nfamily den, which may be a rocky cave or the hollow of an old tree,\r\nthe center of a dense thicket or simply a bed beneath the snow. The\r\ncubs at birth are surprisingly small--not larger than rabbits--and are\r\nnaked, blind, and very slow to develop; hence the mother is extremely\r\nsolicitous about them, and heedlessly brave in their defense. Bears\r\nhibernate only in the coldest regions.\r\n\r\nAllied to the bears is the large black and white \"coon bear\"\r\n(Æluropus), a rare, vegetable-feeding brute of eastern Tibet, which is\r\na relic of the Pleistocene. Near it in structure is the queer Ælurus of\r\nthe same region, which connects the bears with our raccoons and those\r\nother \"little brothers of the bear,\" the kinkajous and coatis of the\r\nAmerican tropics.\r\n\r\n\r\n               THE DOG FAMILY--WOLVES, FOXES AND JACKALS\r\n\r\nSome of my readers may have asked themselves how the order of the\r\nfamilies or other groups of mammals is determined--why the edentates\r\nfollow the marsupials, the Rodentia come next, and so on. The reason is\r\nthat their ancestors, so far as we know them as fossils, seem to have\r\nbeen related in a way that indicates such a succession of development\r\nin time. It is scarcely more than an indication, however, for although\r\nin describing them, or making a list, we must set the animals in a\r\nrow, naturalists long ago ceased attempting to show that any linear\r\narrangement of that kind represented the reality. The present variety\r\namong mammals (as in other classes) is the result of development along\r\ndifferent lines from one or more points of beginning.\r\n\r\nThroughout a long period in the early part of the Tertiary era there\r\nprevailed a class of beasts of prey, some as big as tigers, which,\r\nhowever, were by no means Carnivora, as we now know them, for their\r\nteeth in most cases were still of the insectivore type. These were the\r\ncreodonts, of which I spoke a few pages back. They combined in their\r\nstructure the features of all the different families of Carnivora, and\r\nit was not until there had developed from their stock a single family,\r\nMiacidæ, and the rest had died out, that the canine, or carnassial,\r\nteeth became prominent in their jaws, and nature found in this the\r\nright road to progress. To this anciently extinct family we may trace\r\nall the varieties of existing Carnivora. The oldest and most central\r\nstock appears to be that of the dog family (Canidæ).\r\n\r\nThe least of these are the jackals of Africa and Asia, small, active,\r\nnoisy, reddish and variously marked animals like miniature wolves,\r\nwhich dwell in deserts and open districts, where they hide in dens\r\nduring the day, and come out at night in search of mice and anything\r\nelse they can get. They haunt the suburbs of towns, and do great\r\nservice as scavengers, but also raid farms and villages, killing great\r\nnumbers of poultry, lambs, and weakly sheep and goats by methods much\r\nlike those of our American coyotes.\r\n\r\nThe coyote is a true wolf; and the wolves are connected with the\r\njackals by a small intermediate species in India. Formerly the coyote\r\nranged eastwardly throughout the prairie east of the Mississippi,\r\nbut farmers gradually killed it off. On the sparsely settled plains,\r\nhowever, it survives from the Arctic Circle to the tropics in several\r\nspecies, and continues to maintain itself because its natural enemies\r\nhave been killed off, and because it is extremely clever in dodging\r\nnew perils. It is far more destructive to the ranchman's chickens,\r\npigs, and lambs than even the big timber wolf, but, on the other hand,\r\nbenefits the industry by aiding him in exterminating troublesome\r\ngophers, prairie dogs and rabbits.\r\n\r\nThe big gray wolf--the wolf _par excellence_--which our Western men\r\nusually call \"timber\" wolf, to distinguish it from the coyote (the\r\nwolf of the plains) is the most widely distributed of all beasts of\r\nprey, for despite the various names given it this fierce and capable\r\nanimal is to be found throughout the northern zones of the globe,\r\nfrom Kamchatka, Japan, and northern India right around to Alaska.\r\nWhere civilization prevails it has been killed off, yet lingers where\r\nmountains give it hiding places even in the oldest settled parts of\r\nEurope. In North America wolves abound in all the wilder parts of\r\nthe West and North, contesting with skill and courage the effort of\r\nadvancing civilization to get rid of them. This wolf, in its largest\r\nexamples, such as the often pure white specimens of the Arctic coasts\r\nand islands (where it travels as far north as do the caribou and other\r\ngame), may measure three and a half feet in length, exclusive of the\r\nbushy tail, and may weigh 150 pounds. Its color is typically rusty or\r\nyellowish gray above, more or less grizzled, while the underparts are\r\nwhitish, and the tail is often tipped with black. These hues are paler\r\nin northern than in southern specimens, and in warm regions totally\r\nblack races are known, one of which exists in Florida.\r\n\r\nThe wolf's mode of life is virtually that of the whole canine family,\r\nmaking allowances for differences in climate and circumstances.\r\nChoosing a convenient little cave among the rocks of a mountainside,\r\nor, when this is not handy, digging a burrow for themselves, a pair\r\nwill establish a \"den\" in early summer, where presently six or eight\r\nwhelps may be born; but usually only two or three survive babyhood. At\r\nthis season small game is abundant, and the animals wandering around\r\nalone by day as well as by night, pick up a good living, grow fat and\r\nlazy, and are little to be feared save by the mothers of fawns or\r\nlambs. As the onset of winter fills the forests with snow, cold gales\r\nmoan through the trees, and the long, dark nights enshroud an almost\r\ndead world, this peaceable disposition changes into a hungry ferocity\r\nand a force of craft and caution born of the direst need, which at last\r\nmake the animal formidable to man himself. Yet actual attacks on men\r\nare much more rare than stories and traditions would lead one to think.\r\nIt is at this season, when the rabbits and other small creatures are\r\ngone or hidden in hibernation, and large game must be depended on for\r\nfood, that the wolves form themselves into small companies, or \"packs,\"\r\nand assist one another. To this class of animals hunting is truly \"the\r\nchase,\" for their method is, having found their quarry (in which the\r\ngood nose for a trail and a keen hearing assist them), to keep it in\r\nsight and run it down. Having overtaken the quarry, a sideways leap\r\nenables them to thrust in the long canine, and drag on it--and the\r\nresult is death unless the hunted creature is able to turn and fight\r\noff its foe with hoofs and horn.\r\n\r\nThe forests of southern Brazil harbor a long-legged, reddish species\r\ncalled \"maned,\" which is a true wolf; and South America generally has\r\nseveral kinds of \"fox dogs\" (genus Lycalopex) that sufficiently make\r\nup for the absence of true wolves, as do jackals the lack of wolves in\r\nAfrica and Arabia.\r\n\r\nFoxes have long been regarded as constituting a separate genus under\r\ntheir Latin name Vulpes, but conservative naturalists now think they\r\nbelong with the wolves in the genus Canis (\"a dog\"). The type is that\r\nof a smaller, more agile and delicate animal than a wolf or jackal,\r\nwith a broader skull and sharper muzzle, larger ears, a longer, more\r\nbushy tail, and usually longer fur. Weaker than its wolfish relatives,\r\nthough endowed with great swiftness, and used to playing the double\r\nrôle of hunter and hunted, its brain has been developed to a high\r\ndegree to make up for its bodily deficiencies, and shows capacity\r\nfor further development. Nevertheless the fox is not quite such a\r\nmarvel of shrewdness as he is reputed to be, and fox hunters in Great\r\nBritain--under whose combination of care and chase his education has\r\nbeen more advanced than anywhere else--note much diversity in brain\r\nwork among them.\r\n\r\nAlthough the North American red fox has a different name from the\r\ntypical European one it is virtually the same, and shows its skill and\r\nadaptability by continuing to live and flourish in the midst of our\r\ncivilization, where it practices quite as much sly craft and success\r\nin chicken stealing as does \"Reynard\" on the other side of the ocean.\r\nThe red fox is to be found all over the continent as far south as\r\nGeorgia, and where the winters are cold his long and silky fur becomes\r\nof marketable value, especially in its darker varieties. The animal has\r\ntouches of black on the tail and the legs, and this seems liable to\r\naffect the whole pelage in the North. Thus some are all black; others\r\nare black with every hair tipped with white, and are called \"silvers\";\r\nothers have a blackish band along the spine and across the shoulders.\r\nTo these the name \"cross-foxes\" is given. The skins so marked bring\r\nhigh prices, and an extensive industry has arisen in Canada by breeding\r\nblack and marked foxes in captivity, where pure color strains have been\r\ndeveloped, whereas in nature one or more of these melanistic varieties\r\nmay occur in any litter of normally red parents.\r\n\r\nNorth America has three or more other species of fox, one of which,\r\nthe gray fox, is common throughout the country east and south of\r\nthe Appalachian heights, as far north as the lower valley of the\r\nHudson River. It is smaller and grayer than the red fox, is more of\r\na forest-keeping animal, and does not burrow, but makes its nest\r\nin the bottom of a decayed tree or stump, or within a hollow log.\r\nLiving in a climate where small game is abundant the year round, and\r\nchicken-stealing comparatively easy, he has not been driven to the\r\nstraits of getting food in winter to which the northern foxes are\r\ndriven, and hence has developed less of the ingenuity and cleverness\r\nthey show. On the high plains of the West dwells a small, active fox,\r\nknown as the kit fox, or \"swift,\" which feeds on the ground squirrels\r\nand mice of that region, and makes its home in a burrow (often one dug\r\nby a prairie dog), where it hibernates in winter. It is now rare and\r\nvery wary.\r\n\r\nThroughout the polar regions right around the globe is found the\r\narctic fox in great numbers, and wandering in summer, at least, to\r\nthe farthest islands, where its prey consists of lemmings, rabbits,\r\nptarmigan and fish. This is a shy little beast, with blunt nose, short,\r\nrounded ears, a very long, bushy tail, and the soles of the feet well\r\nshod with hair, giving them a firm and warm grip on the snow and ice\r\nover which they leave tiny tracks from Labrador to Siberia. In summer\r\nits dress is brown with whitish or drab underparts; but in autumn this\r\nis replaced by a coat of long, pure white hair beneath which is an\r\nundercoat of fine wool. A small proportion, however, are never either\r\nwhite or dark brown, but are slate gray all the year round. In some\r\nrather southerly places the \"blues\" prevail, forming a local race. Such\r\nis the case in Greenland, Iceland, and the Aleutian Islands, where blue\r\nfoxes are now carefully preserved and cared for in a semi-domestic\r\ncondition for the sake of their valuable fur. Several small kinds of\r\nfoxes occur in Asia, and in India one affords some sport with hounds.\r\nThe prettiest of all are the little sand-colored, big-eared \"fennecs\"\r\nof the deserts of northern Africa and Arabia. No foxes tame well, nor\r\ndo any of them cross with dogs as wolves and jackals constantly do,\r\nand apparently no fox blood has entered into the composition of the\r\ndomestic dog.\r\n\r\nThere remain in this ancient and cosmopolitan family a considerable\r\nnumber of animals which from their general appearance we call \"dogs.\"\r\nAmong these is the long-bodied, short-legged, primitive \"bush dog\" of\r\nGuiana; the \"bakoor\" of South Africa; several Oriental species; and\r\nthe hated \"hunting dog\" of Africa. The last named is a terror even to\r\na lion. It ranges the country in swift-footed packs, dreaded by every\r\ncreature of both forest and veldt, and every writer increases its\r\nreputation for both strategy and ferocity. This has led to its being\r\nkilled off, until now it is common only in the remote wilderness.\r\nFormerly it was known even in Egypt, and it is the party-colored,\r\nprick-eared dog represented on the ancient mural paintings at Beni\r\nHasan and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nOf the Asiatic wild dogs the most familiar is that one of India called\r\nin the north \"buansuah\" and in the south \"dhole.\" Like the others it\r\nis normally rusty red in color, and makes its lair in rocky jungles,\r\nwhence, more often by day than by night, it makes its forays usually\r\nin packs from which even the leopard and tiger flee--just as in this\r\ncountry half a dozen curs will send a cougar or jaguar up a tree in\r\nfright. But it avoids settlements, and does little damage to domestic\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to the consideration of the origin of our domestic\r\ndogs, a matter which seems to me more simple than some authors have\r\nregarded it. This was doubtless among the very first animals to become\r\nattached to the camp or family of primitive man, and in every case,\r\nat first, at least, it would be of some local species of wolf, for\r\nanatomists agree that no admixture of any blood outside the genus Canis\r\nis traceable in the dog; and probably would be cherished or tolerated\r\nas a reserve supply of food rather than as an aid in hunting. But it\r\nis not unreasonable to suppose that when famine came and the stone\r\nax was raised against the poor animals, those that had proved good\r\nwatchers, or were the special pets of the women and children, would\r\nbe the last to be sacrificed and sometimes would be saved altogether.\r\nThus an improving and alterative selection would have begun almost\r\nfrom the start. Moreover, these early camp dogs would become modified\r\nby interbreeding and by the influences of captivity; and as their\r\nvagabondish owners wandered about would be crossed not only with\r\ndiverse sorts of tamed dogs, but with the wild stocks of new countries;\r\nand this complication would increase as civilization extended.\r\nNevertheless this appears not quite to complete the story. There is a\r\nquality which we recognize as \"doggy,\" and as something distinctive.\r\nWhence came it? I am of the opinion that it is derived from one or more\r\nkinds of canine animals, exterminated by primitive man, which were\r\nmore \"doggy\" than wolfish, and which formed in large part the stock\r\nof the first domesticated dogs. This supposition is supported by the\r\nfact that there have been found remains of a distinct canine species,\r\nallied to the Australian dingo, which was domesticated by Neolithic\r\nmen, and perhaps contributed to existing varieties of the dog. The\r\nearliest Egyptian monuments show pictures of large dogs with \"lop\"\r\nears--denoting one of the most striking differences between dogs and\r\nwild wolves or jackals, whose ears are invariably \"pricked.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE SOURCE OF COSTLY FURS\r\n\r\nA descendant of the Creodonta called Cynodictis, which lived in the\r\nEocene, or earliest of the Tertiary periods, is regarded as the\r\nforefather of the dog family, but its character is such that it might\r\nas well be said to be the progenitor of the weasel family (Mustelidæ),\r\nwhich may thus be suitably considered the nearest relatives of the\r\nCanidæ. These are the small, but alert, muscular and wide-awake animals\r\nwhose coats, adapted to the cold regions in which most of them live,\r\nfurnish us with warm and beautiful furs; hence the Mustelidæ may be\r\ncalled the family of \"fur bearers.\" They resemble the dog tribe in the\r\nbreadth of the skull, and in the dentition, which serves well for the\r\nwide variety in their fare; but instead of the long, high-stepping\r\nlegs of the galloping dogs they have short, strong limbs adapted\r\nto creeping, digging, climbing, or swimming. The swimmers are the\r\notters--one marine, the other a denizen of rivers and lakes. The sea\r\notter is peculiar to our northwestern coast, where it used to be\r\nvery abundant from California to Bering Sea, but is now so rare, on\r\naccount of the great demand for its unequaled fur, that its pelt is\r\nworth several hundred dollars to the fortunate hunter. It is truly\r\npelagic, rarely landing anywhere but on some outer reef or isolated\r\nrock, and eating fish, sea urchins, and crabs; and is much larger than\r\nthe land otter, and with a short, flattened tail instead of the long,\r\ntapering one that characterizes the latter. Of the river otters about\r\nten species are recognized, scattered all over the cooler parts of the\r\nworld, and much alike in their four webbed feet and fish-eating habits.\r\nThey are lively, playful creatures, and by their wariness, nocturnal\r\nhabits, and skill in hiding their burrows, made in the bank with an\r\nunderwater entrance, they are able to persist here and there in the\r\nmidst of civilization.\r\n\r\nAllied to the otters in structure are the badgers and skunks. Of\r\nthe former, our badger has been killed off everywhere except in\r\nthe northwest, where it still digs its deep holes in the ground for\r\nits daylight rest and partial hibernation, and finds plentiful food\r\namong the gophers, doing the ranchmen more good by destroying these\r\npests than it does harm by its digging. The European badger differs\r\nin various ways; and there is an Oriental one, the \"stinking\" teledu,\r\nwhich illustrates the fetid odor that belongs to all of this family.\r\nThis disagreeable quality is developed in the skunks into an effective\r\nweapon of defense. The food of skunks consists mainly of insects and\r\nfield mice, and is everywhere so abundant that they find civilization\r\nfavorable to them rather than otherwise, and remain numerous all over\r\nthe country in several species, of which the familiar large northern\r\nskunk, and the small southern striped one, are best known. The skunks\r\nare confined to America, but South Africa has a very similar creature\r\nin the zorilla.\r\n\r\nWe now come to a large number of vigorous, bloodthirsty and cunning\r\nlittle carnivores, the terror of small game, as are the cats of\r\nlarger animals, which are grouped by their similarity of structure\r\nin the \"weasel\" section of the family (Mustelinæ). Some are mainly\r\nterrestrial, others arboreal in habit of life. All have rather long\r\nbodies, short legs armed with strong, sharp claws, pointed heads,\r\ncatlike teeth, and brains equal, if not superior, to any other\r\ncarnivore. Among the terrestrial species the glutton of Europe and its\r\nanalogue in Canada, the wolverine, are prominent. The wolverine is a\r\nlarge, shaggy, somewhat clumsy animal that seeks its prey mainly on\r\nthe ground, but occasionally climbs to a low branch or an overhanging\r\nrock whence it may leap upon the backs of a deer or sheep. It displays\r\nthe greatest sagacity and persistence in getting a living where life\r\nis precarious; and is so clever in robbing the trappers' lures and\r\npenetrating his \"caches\" that the forest people consider it hardly\r\nanything else than a devil on four legs, and charge it with deliberate\r\nmalice. The voracity of its European cousin long ago became the subject\r\nof ridiculous traditions, and has given the word \"glutton\" to the\r\nlanguage. Two similar, but smaller, mustelines, the tayra and the\r\ngrison, inhabit Central and South America. The latter defends itself in\r\nthe same manner as the skunk.\r\n\r\nThe weasels, stoats, polecats, minks, and the like form a group\r\ndistinctly northern, except that one species ranges southward into\r\nthe Andes. They do their work on the ground, although some are able\r\nto climb trees. Slender, lithe, sharp-clawed, secretively colored,\r\nand endowed with strength, speed and cleverness, the weasels are the\r\nscourge and terror of the ground-keeping animals, and do more than any\r\nother class of agents to restrain mice, gophers and similar nuisances.\r\nEurope and Siberia have the stoat, the ermine-weasel and the polecat,\r\na domestic form of which is the ferret; and we have in North America\r\nseveral distinct weasels, as the short-tailed and the long-tailed of\r\nthe East, the bridled weasel of the Pacific Coast, the black-footed\r\nferret of the plains, and the little six-inch \"mouse hunter\" of the\r\nNorthwest, which is the smallest carnivore known. All the northern\r\nweasels become pure white in winter when they live in a region where\r\nthe snow lies continuously and the cold is steady; but south of that\r\nline they do not change color. The change from the summer brown to the\r\nwinter white--when they become \"ermines\"--is produced by an actual\r\nloss of color in the hair; but the spring change back to brown is\r\neffected by shedding the old white hair and getting a new brown coat.\r\nIn the Middle Ages ermine fur was permitted to be worn only by royalty,\r\nand later by judges on the bench. A somewhat different, and strictly\r\nAmerican, species is the mink. It is somewhat less slender than the\r\nweasels, and is semiaquatic in habits, dwelling always near streams,\r\nwhere it feeds on earthworms, frogs, and fishes. Having this kind of\r\nfood, and being keen-witted and secretive, it has been able to continue\r\nto exist in the midst of civilization, and the vast number of its dark\r\npelts that come to the fur market are nearly all got by farmers' boys\r\nin traps set near home.\r\n\r\nThe most valuable of the fur bearers, however, are those that belong\r\nto the forests of the North and dwell in trees--the sables, martens,\r\nand pekans. The sable is Siberian, the marten is North European, and\r\nthe pine marten and pekan are North American. The first three are\r\nhardly distinguishable, each averaging about eighteen inches in length,\r\nexclusive of the long, furry tail, and are brown, somewhat lighter on\r\nthe underparts, the breast-spot of the Canadian species being orange.\r\nThe body is long and supple, the legs short and the toes separate, with\r\nsharp, long claws, as becomes so expert a tree-climber. The martens\r\nexhibit great agility and grace in their movements, and live usually\r\nin trees, furnishing with a bed of leaves a hollow in a lofty decaying\r\ntrunk or sometimes in a rocky crevice. Here the young are brought forth\r\nin litters of six or eight early each spring. In winter, however, they\r\ndescend daily, and hunt rabbits and other prey over the snow. This\r\nis particularly true of the big Canadian pekan, or \"fisher\" marten,\r\nwhich is the least common of the tribe. These martens fade away as\r\ncivilization advances toward their forest retreats, and now are to\r\nbe obtained only in the wildest parts of the Canadian woods; and the\r\neffort to tame and breed them in captivity has met with little success.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     CIVETS, MONGOOSES AND HYENAS\r\n\r\nThis group of Old World animals represents the product of lines of\r\ndescent that had their origin very near that of the dogs, as is\r\nparticularly evident in the history of the hyenas (family Hyænidæ).\r\nBut between the noble courage and fidelity of the dog and the cowardly\r\nbrutishness of the hyena lies a great distance in character--as it\r\nappears from the human point of view. Of course it will not do to\r\napply our highly elaborated standards to a moral estimate of wild\r\nanimal behavior, or to use seriously such terms as \"cruel,\" \"selfish,\"\r\nand the like, especially in the case of the predatory beasts that\r\nwork hard for their captures, must kill them the best way they can,\r\nand must satisfy their own wants before yielding place to rivals or\r\ninferiors; yet we cannot help admiring certain qualities in some of\r\nthem and disliking others, as if they were inspired by praiseworthy or\r\nblameworthy motives. In the character of the hyenas, thus criticised,\r\nthere is nothing admirable except their extraordinary brute strength.\r\nThis is shown chiefly in their big heads, where their jaws are filled\r\nwith teeth of extraordinary size, and are worked by muscles that\r\nenable them to crunch the leg bones of an ox, or indent and bend thick\r\niron, of which amazing examples are given by Selous, Neuman and other\r\nAfrican sportsmen. Otherwise they are the meanest of brutes, hated and\r\ndespised by every man and beast in the countries (Africa and southern\r\nAsia) that they afflict.\r\n\r\nRelated to them, but very different in every way are the many species\r\nof ichneumons and civets (family Viverridæ) of the same parts of the\r\nworld. The ichneumons, or mongooses, are small, dark-colored, unspotted\r\nanimals, varying in size from that of a weasel to the bigness of a\r\nhouse cat, with compact bodies and pointed muzzles. They are active,\r\nbold and predacious, living on small game of every sort, and making\r\ntheir homes in holes in the ground. They are noted for their animosity\r\nto reptiles, and in ancient Egypt were protected as \"sacred\" because\r\nthey killed asps and hunted for and ate crocodiles' eggs. The old term\r\n\"ichneumon\" has disappeared, however, in favor of the term \"mongoose,\"\r\nwhich is the name of the East Indian species famous for snake killing.\r\nIt is able, by its astonishing quickness, to spring upon and kill\r\na cobra, even when that deadly snake is prepared to strike at its\r\nlittle foe. Mongooses were colonized in Jamaica and other West Indian\r\nislands years ago to destroy the rats that were a plague in the sugar\r\nplantations; but they presently turned their attention to the poultry\r\nas easier game, and became a greater nuisance than the rats. These\r\nfierce little snake killers constitute the \"herpestine\" section of the\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BAT WITH YOUNG BAT IN EACH POUCH, FOUND HANGING TO A\r\n  TELEGRAPH WIRE, NEAR LINCOLN, NEBRASKA\r\n  Photo, Keystone View Co.]\r\n\r\nThe \"viverrine\" section contains the civets, which have elongated\r\nbodies, terrierlike heads, small, round, five-toed feet with\r\nimperfectly sheathed claws, long, often bushy tails, and coats of rough\r\ndark-colored hair marked with blackish stripes, bars, or squarish\r\nblotches. The species are numerous, and varied, those of central\r\nAfrica, called \"genets,\" resembling weasels. They include the\r\nlinsangs of the East Indies, with soft, fawn-colored fur; several East\r\nIndian species inhabiting trees and going by the name of \"tree cats\"\r\nand \"toddy cats,\" one of which is domesticated as a mouser and pretty\r\npet by the natives; and the black binturong of the Orient, which is the\r\nonly animal of the Old World, not a marsupial, that has a prehensile\r\ntail.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BLACK SPIDER MONKEY\r\n  Photo, Ewing Galloway]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUFFED LEMUR, ATTRACTIVE BY ITS COLORING\r\n  Photo, Elwin R. Sanborn, New York Zoological Society]\r\n\r\nThe distinctive peculiarity of the true civet cats is the possession\r\nof a pair of open pouches in the groin holding an oily substance\r\nhaving an intense musky odor and known as \"civet.\" This is present in\r\nthe five Oriental species, but is most copious in the civet cat of\r\nnorthern Africa, which on this account is kept captive and occasionally\r\nrelieved, by the aid of a small spoon, of its civet for which perfumers\r\nwill pay a high price.\r\n\r\nMadagascar possesses a remarkable animal in the foussa, or fossane,\r\nwhich is nearly the size of our puma, has a weasellike head and a very\r\nlong tail, and is a fierce nocturnal marauder. It is classed with the\r\nViverridæ, but stands intermediate between them and the cats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\n                      BEASTS OF PREY--_Continued_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the cats (family Felidæ) we come to the most recent and advanced\r\ndevelopment of the carnivorous type, by straight descent from the\r\nEocene Miacidæ. Their cardinal characteristics are found in their round\r\nheads and short muzzles; their teeth fitted for cutting rather than\r\nchewing, with sharp and slender canines very prominent; their sheathed\r\nclaws; and their powerful activity. Although the civets and the foussa\r\nhave retractile claws they do not show the perfection exhibited in\r\nthis feature in the cat family. Here the final bone of every toe (the\r\nterminal phalange) is so hinged upon the one next behind it that\r\nordinarily it stands upright, held there by an elastic ligament, with\r\nthe sharp, curved claw hidden in a sheath of skin and thus kept from\r\ntouching the ground and so becoming blunted; for in the cat's method\r\nof work sharp claws are needed to hold the prey on which it has leaped\r\nuntil its teeth can come into play. When this seizing leap is made a\r\ntendon running along the underside of the toe is retracted, pulling\r\ndown the claw and causing it to pierce and hold the body of the victim.\r\nThis is the explanation of Puss's familiar scratching ability, and\r\naccounts for the fact that while dogs, developing long legs for their\r\nstyle of attack, chase and finally seize their prey with their big,\r\nstrong canines, cats steal upon it or more often lie in ambush and\r\npounce on it, using their slender canines mainly as piercers. The cats\r\ndo their hunting mostly alone, and are therefore largely at the mercy\r\nof wolves, etc., who go in packs; and herein lies the origin of the\r\nfear and hate with which cats regard all dogs.\r\n\r\nThe cats are a very uniform group, all the many species belonging to\r\nthe single genus Felis, except the few lynxes and the cheetah. No\r\nbetter example of the race can be found than our \"fireside sphinx.\"\r\nShe is a direct descendant of the \"Caffre,\" or \"Libyan\" cat, a native\r\nof northeastern Africa, and especially of Egypt, where she still\r\nruns wild. Reddish sandy in color, with faint, broken, darker bars\r\nacross the body, limbs, and tail, and narrow vertical lines on the\r\nface, excellent copies of this original of all the domestic cats of\r\nthe western world, at least, may often be seen in our houses. This\r\nlikeness is supported by the evidence of history and archæology--the\r\nskeletons of Egyptian cat mummies, and bones associated with the dawn\r\nof history. In regard to the present, however, some deduction must be\r\nmade. In all parts of the world one or another of the smaller wildcats\r\nof the country have been kept as pets in native houses; and wherever\r\nthe people have been far enough advanced to raise and store grain, they\r\nhave cultivated a cat or some other animal to free their granaries\r\nfrom thieving mice. It was for this purpose, no doubt, that the cats\r\nof Egypt were first tamed; and then, to make the people prudently\r\nkeep them and care for them, the priests invented a beneficent and\r\ncheerful cat goddess, who, naturally, was said to walk abroad mostly by\r\nmoonlight. When the tamed Egyptian cats reached Europe with the early\r\nPhoenician colonists and traders they would certainly soon meet and\r\ninterbreed with the native stock; and to such crossing is probably\r\ndue the banded or \"tabby\" cats. On the other hand, brindled cats were\r\nformerly unknown in eastern Asia, whose spotted or foxy house cats were\r\nderived from other and local sources. Since intercourse between Europe\r\nand the Orient became frequent, more or less mixture has occurred;\r\nalthough one very distinct Eastern breed persists--the long-furred\r\nPersian or Angora cats, a race probably derived prehistorically from\r\nthe manul, of Turkestan.\r\n\r\nThe differences between members of this genus Felis, all of which seem\r\nable to interbreed, when similar in size, are chiefly of size and coat.\r\nTheir prey and hunting methods are substantially alike everywhere,\r\nand in domestication cats are slow to vary from the wild type in any\r\nrespect except in color--a result of their mixed ancestry. Puss remains\r\na savage in a civilized coat, and, accepting condescendingly the novel\r\ncomforts offered her, refuses to forsake her own forest gods for the\r\nfireside shrines of her tempters.\r\n\r\nThe word \"wildcat\" is naturally used for any small feline, but strictly\r\nbelongs to the yellowish, tabby-marked, forest cat (_F. catus_) of\r\nEurope and Siberia, now becoming rare. Closely allied to it is the\r\nmanul, of the central Asian steppes, where the long fur that envelopes\r\nit (as preserved in our domestic Persian beauties) is required by the\r\nawful cold of those lofty plains. Several other small cats inhabit\r\nthe desert parts of southern Asia, which abound in rodents; and the\r\nlong-legged, powerful, fawn-colored caracal ranges, nowhere numerously,\r\nfrom India and Mesopotamia around to Arabia and South Africa. Africa\r\nhas several other cats of the open country, the best known of which is\r\nthe swift-running, handsome serval, which is an expert tree climber.\r\nSoutheastern Asia has three or four beautifully marked forest cats, and\r\nfour of great size--three leopards and the tiger.\r\n\r\nThe typical leopard is distributed from China and Borneo westward\r\nto southern Arabia and all over Africa, except in deserts and cold\r\nmountains; but the ounce, which may be regarded as a variety of it,\r\ninhabits the Himalayas, staying near the borders of the snow line for\r\nthe most part, and another beautiful variety, the clouded leopard,\r\nfrequents the forests of the median slopes of that vast range. The\r\nground color of the leopard is yellowish brown, of varying intensity,\r\nand is thickly covered with rosettes of black spots inclosing a clear\r\narea, with the breast and belly white. The favorite haunts of leopards\r\nare rocky, brushy hills with holes suitable for a den, where they may\r\nwatch the surrounding country, and at sunset descend with astonishing\r\ncelerity and stealth to cut off any straggling animal returning to the\r\nvillage at nightfall. They prey boldly on the small Hindu cattle and\r\nponies, but more habitually on the sheep, goats, and dogs, and now and\r\nthen (but rarely) turn man-eaters.\r\n\r\nThe leopard cannot overcome, ordinarily, animals as large as the lion\r\nand tiger slay, but everything of lesser size is acceptable, down\r\nto robbing birds' nests and clawing grubs out of rotten wood. It is\r\nsomewhat smaller than our cougar, a male in good condition weighing\r\nabout 125 pounds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TIGERS\r\n  (_Felis tigris_)]\r\n\r\nThe tiger--for there is only one, in spite of circus advertisements\r\nof a \"royal Bengal\" as something different--is purely Asiatic, the\r\nspecies ranging from the Caucasus and the mountains of Ararat to the\r\nEast Indies (Sumatra and Java), and northward to central Siberia and\r\nSakhalin. It is to be found throughout all India, but does not occur in\r\nCeylon.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the tiger always brings to mind that other great cat, the\r\nlion. These powerful marauders dispute the title of \"king of beasts.\"\r\nTheir respective realms overlap but little. The lion, like the other\r\nbig cats, is a relic of a diminishing race and kingdom. In the early\r\nStone Age the \"cave\" lion (virtually the same as the present _Felis\r\nleo_) roamed throughout the southern half of Europe, and its final\r\nextermination north of the Mediterranean was doubtless accomplished\r\nby prehistoric men. Afghanistan, Beluchistan and northern Persia were\r\nrid of them long ago. A century ago lions were more or less prevalent\r\nin northwestern India, but now none remain save a few in the Gheer,\r\na wooded hilly tract of Kattiawar. In Persia they survive only in\r\nFarsistan, where marshes afford shelter, and the hosts of pigs feeding\r\non the acorns of the oak forests furnish subsistence. But they were\r\nlong ago exterminated from all Asia Minor, Arabia, Egypt, and Algeria.\r\nFrom Abyssinia, and the southern Sahara southward to the Orange\r\nRiver, lions still exist except in the most populous districts, and\r\nin some places are very numerous. This range of territory shows that,\r\nunlike the forest-loving tiger, the lion is an inhabitant of open,\r\nbushy country, finding its game in the herds of antelopes, zebras,\r\nand similar plains-running animals rather than in the jungle fauna to\r\nwhich the tiger is confined; also that the tiger is inured to a far\r\ncolder climate. This difference in habitat and hunting requirements\r\naccounts, in the minds of those who pay much attention to adaptive\r\n(or \"protective\") coloration, for the difference in their dress, for\r\nthe tiger is said to become almost invisible in its yellow coat and\r\nvertical black stripes amid the flickering shadows of the wood, or when\r\ncreeping through the long Indian grass, while the unmarked, grayish\r\nyellow, or sand tint, of the lion is equally unnoticeable on the desert\r\nor on the sere veldt of its East African hunting grounds. The great\r\nmane of the male lion--but some never acquire this ornament, or only\r\nscantily--and his greater height at the shoulder give him a majestic\r\nmien.\r\n\r\nA lion of large size measures about nine and a half feet from the nose\r\nto the tip of the tail, which is about three feet long; stands three\r\nand a half feet high at the shoulders; and weighs about five hundred\r\npounds. Most specimens, however, fall far short of these figures; and\r\nthe largest examples have come from South Africa. The dimensions and\r\nweight of tigers average just about the same, the extreme examples\r\non record having no doubt been measured along the curves of the body\r\ninstead of in a straight line between the two terminal points, nose and\r\ntip of tail, as is the proper method. The literature relating to these\r\ntwo royal and puissant beasts is immense in its extent, and the best\r\nof it is that written by the hunter-naturalists who during the past\r\ncentury have studied and fought them in their native wilds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LION\r\n  (_Felis leo_)]\r\n\r\nThe western hemisphere has a series of native cats which, although\r\nnot equal in size and strength to the lion and tiger, are hardly less\r\nformidable in view of the game they hunt. The biggest is the jaguar,\r\nwhich is found from western Texas to northern Argentina. It is about\r\nthe size of the leopard, but has a bulkier body, bigger head, shorter\r\nand more massive limbs, and shorter tail; hence, while less active\r\nand supple, it is perhaps more powerful than the leopard, and certainly\r\nis stronger than the puma. The ground color varies from the yellowish\r\ngray seen in arid Paraguay to almost red in the steaming equatorial\r\nswamps, while in the lower Orinoco Valley deep brown and black ones are\r\ncommon; but there is only one species. The coat is everywhere spotted\r\nwith black, not in the leopard's hollow rosettes, but forming larger,\r\nirregular groups, each inclosing a black central spot.\r\n\r\nThis is the \"tigre\" of the American tropics, and indeed, is so called\r\nwherever Spanish is spoken. It hunts the largest game of its country,\r\nespecially tapirs and deer; and wherever domestic animals are reared\r\nit becomes a destructive pest. For the most part, however, these cats\r\nsubsist on capybaras and other rodents; and in Mexico on peccaries,\r\nstriking down stragglers and then hastening up a tree out of the way\r\nof the furious herd of these sharp-toothed pigs brought together by\r\nthe squealing of the first victim. Rarely found away from water, which\r\nseems as necessary to it as to the tiger, it is not surprising to find\r\nthat in such places as the reedy borders of the La Plata fish form\r\nits main diet, snatched from the water by the paw. On the Amazon it\r\nfeeds largely on turtles and their eggs. It attacks the manatee in its\r\nown element, and has been seen \"dragging out of the water this bulky\r\nanimal, weighing as much as an ox.\" Even the crocodile and cayman are\r\nregularly preyed upon. Its fondness for monkeys is also well known, and\r\nit is hated and reviled by them with the same fury as leads the East\r\nIndian apes to hurl sticks and bad language at the tiger.\r\n\r\nThe \"cougar,\" as Buffon named it, the \"puma\" of the Peruvians,\r\n\"panther\" and \"mountain lion,\" as it is known in the United States,\r\nis another big American cat familiar to woodsmen from New England,\r\nMinnesota, and northern British Columbia southward to Patagonia; and\r\neverywhere it is so precisely uniform that the most hair-splitting\r\nsystemists have been unable to subdivide its species (_Felis concolor_)\r\ninto local varieties. Its upper parts vary from foxy red to a dull\r\nblue, this difference in color having no reference to age, season or\r\nlocality. The underparts are white; and there are no spots anywhere\r\nexcept that the lips and outer rim of the ear are black, and a patch\r\nof white marks each side of the muzzle. The panther was much dreaded\r\nby the early settlers of the Eastern States and by the frontiersmen\r\nsettling the Mississippi Valley, who were more alarmed by its doleful\r\nscreams as it wandered about in the night, than by any history of harm,\r\nfor it avoided men with a greater fear than their own; nevertheless, it\r\nbecame a nuisance by its raids on the farmer's live stock and he killed\r\nit off, so that now pumas are to be met with only in the forested and\r\nswampy fastnesses of some of the Gulf States and in the Far West.\r\nThere they still do great damage to the young animals on ranches,\r\nespecially where horses are plentiful on the range. This is equally\r\ntrue of South America. Nowhere, however, is the puma feared by mankind\r\nas is the jaguar; on the contrary, remarkable stories are recorded, and\r\nconstantly being verified by experience, not only of the cowardice of\r\nthe animal, but of its apparent desire to make friends with humanity,\r\nfollowing lonely persons without harming them, apparently merely in\r\nsatisfaction of an innocent curiosity. It is hunted usually with dogs,\r\nto escape which it will climb into a tree, and once there remain to be\r\nshot rather than come down to fight, even when the hunters are close up.\r\n\r\nTropical America is the home of several smaller cats, some of which\r\namong the spotted ones are probably only varieties of the ocelot. This\r\nhighly variable but always beautiful creature is about two and a half\r\nfeet long in body, rather long in the legs, is an expert tree-climber,\r\nand is abundant from Oklahoma southward into the Brazilian forest, but\r\nhas a different name in every country. It is grayish, thickly marked\r\nwith fawn-colored, black-edged, oval patches and stripes in endless\r\nvariety; and its fur is one of the most marketable in the country. On\r\nthe prairies and plains of the open country south of Brazil the pampas\r\ncat, or \"pajero,\" is common. It is of robust form, with long hair,\r\nvery plain in its grayish tint on the back, but beautifully spotted\r\nand striped on the belly and legs. It is a ground-runner, preying on\r\nrodents and birds. Brazil has in its forests a notable cat of medium\r\nsize called \"jaguarundi,\" with a noticeably slender form, short legs\r\nand a tail nearly as long as its body. It is dark gray in hue and\r\nentirely unspotted. This may, on further study, turn out to be only a\r\nvariety of the \"eyra,\" another cat of the tropics, sometimes met with\r\nas far north as the Rio Grande Valley, which looks in its unspotted\r\nchestnut coat more like a huge weasel than a cat. It is a graceful and\r\nnimble climber, and lives on prey caught in trees.\r\n\r\nOur common \"bobcat,\" the wildcat best known to most readers, is a\r\nlynx--one might say _the_ lynx, since in spite of the wide variety\r\nthat specimens show between those of Quebec and those of Texas, for\r\nexample, all seem to be one species, which is only locally different\r\nfrom the lynx of the Old World. But Spain appears to possess a distinct\r\nspecies in the pardine lynx. Lynxes differ from the typical cats\r\n(_Felis_) in having only two instead of three pre-molar teeth, but most\r\nnotably in their heavy bodies, stout limbs, big and powerful feet,\r\nvery short, thick tails, and the tufts of hair on the tips of the\r\nears. The big Canadian lynxes are clothed in coats of long grizzled\r\nhair, valuable in the fur market and suited to the freezing winters\r\nof their home, where their fare during the cold months is restricted\r\nalmost entirely to hares; but in the United States, and especially\r\ntoward the south, these cats are much smaller, have thin coats and show\r\nreddish and yellowish tints with much spottings. They have survived the\r\npresence of civilization wherever rough hills or swampy forests give\r\nthem a refuge, and they prey on mice, rabbits, birds, and poultry.\r\n\r\nA single cat remains to be mentioned, the curious cheetah, or hunting\r\nleopard, which is known all over southern Asia, and Africa, and in\r\nIndia and Persia is trained to hunt antelopes. It is somewhat less in\r\nsize of body than the leopard, but stands on long legs, and in color\r\nis yellowish, with many obscure blackish spots. Its great peculiarity,\r\nhowever, is the fact that its claws are not retractile, like those\r\nof the true cats, or only partly so; and that it chases its prey\r\nwith great speed and in a doglike manner, although lacking the dog's\r\npersistence and endurance. This mingling of characteristics makes it\r\nhard to classify, and it perhaps should have led, instead of closed,\r\nthe chapter on the cat family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\n               INSECTIVORA--HEDGEHOGS, MOLES AND SHREWS\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain we have to deal with the scattered and feeble relics of a once\r\nimportant race; but that was long ago, even as geologists use the\r\nword long, for the order of insectivores (Insectivora) may be traced\r\nbackward to the very earliest, hardly identifiable, fossil remains of\r\nmammalian pioneers in a reptilian world. These are known mainly by\r\ntheir dentition, which in this order is characterized by weak canines,\r\nsmall sharp incisors, and all the back teeth small, with many points\r\nand sharp edges designed for cutting through the shards of insects,\r\nshells of eggs, snail shells and the like, rather than for chewing.\r\nThey had become, even in the Eocene period, a numerous and varied\r\ngroup, including arboreal, terrestrial, and aquatic types, some of\r\nconsiderable size, besides many minute forms comparable to the moles\r\nand shrews of the present day, and very likely ancestral to them. At\r\nthe beginning of the Tertiary, they are indistinguishable from the\r\nearlier of the creodonts, but these rapidly developed into powerful\r\nbeasts, while the insectivores retained more nearly their ancient ways,\r\nand in the later Tertiary diminished rapidly in numbers and variety.\r\nTo-day only a few survivors are left, protected from their enemies by\r\narmor, as in the case of the hedgehogs; by a subterranean mode of life,\r\nas the moles; by their agility, minute size, and unpleasant odor and\r\ntaste, as are the shrews; or, finally, by their exile in some remote\r\ncorner of the world, where enemies are few. Thus we find remnants\r\nof families so widely separated as Madagascar and Cuba--the same\r\ndisintegration that has overtaken many another ancient and decadent\r\ntribe; and their organization is so generalized that systemists find it\r\ndifficult to place them in any serial arrangement with other orders;\r\nthe big Malayan kaguan, for instance, which lives in trees and looks\r\nand behaves like a flying squirrel, was long classed with the lemurs.\r\n\r\nOldest of the existing insectivores, and nearest the original type, is\r\nthe hedgehog of Europe, which, when rolled up, presents to its enemy a\r\nliving chestnut bur of stiff spines hardly bigger than a baseball. All\r\nday it lies curled up asleep in an underground nest (where in winter\r\nit hibernates), and wanders about at night hunting for insects, worms,\r\nsnails, slugs and the like, and savagely attacking and killing every\r\nviper it comes across--a valuable little animal, preserved by every\r\nintelligent gardener. Next to it are the lively little \"tupaias,\" or\r\ntree shrews of the East, and the queer, long-nosed, kangaroo-shaped\r\njumping shrews of the deserts. A rarer oddity is the river shrew\r\nof West Africa, looking and acting like a miniature muskrat. Then\r\nthere are the \"almiquis\" of Cuba and Haiti, which suggest small,\r\nground-traveling opossums, whose nearest relatives are the spiny\r\n\"tenrecs\" of Madagascar.\r\n\r\nMore familiar to us are the moles and shrews of northern countries.\r\nMoles are chiefly remarkable for the adaptation of their frames to the\r\nrequirements of an underground existence, in which they must travel and\r\nseek their food, and not merely make their nightly home in burrows.\r\nThis has brought about an alteration of the forelimbs into digging\r\ntools of really gigantic power when we consider the size of the animal,\r\nand a strength of shoulders that enables them to bore their way through\r\nloose soil without shoveling it out, save at long intervals. Everybody\r\nknows the upheaved ridges that mark their paths on the lawn as they\r\nmove here and there beneath the grass roots in search of grubs and\r\nearthworms. One of our common species, preferring wet meadows to the\r\nuplands, is the star-nosed mole, whose muzzle is encircled by pink\r\ntentacles, very sensitive, which give it its name.\r\n\r\nHighest in rank among insectivores, though least in size, are the\r\nshrews, one of which, our Cooper's shrew, is the smallest of all\r\nmammals. They are mouselike in appearance, but with long, flexible,\r\nmuch bewhiskered snouts, and are ceaselessly active, wandering about\r\nunderneath leaves, old grass, and logs, and boring their way into loose\r\nloam or the punky wood of decayed stumps, in search of earthworms,\r\ngrubs, beetles, slugs, and similar prey, including young mice and the\r\nfledglings of ground-nesting birds, and varying this fare by bites from\r\nsoft-shelled beechnuts, tuberous roots, etc. They are quick of hearing,\r\nbold, pugnacious, and fierce, often killing and eating other shrews;\r\ndifficult to keep alive in captivity, utterly untamable, and easily\r\nfrightened to death.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MANDRILL, MOUTH OPEN TO SNARL\r\n  Photos, Elwin R.

Sanborn, New York Zoological Society]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\n                     THE BATS--WING-HANDED MAMMALS\r\n\r\n\r\nNext in advance of the Insectivora stands the order Chiroptera\r\n(\"hand-wing\"), which is the tribe of bats, divisible into two\r\nsuborders--the large, diurnal fruit bats, and the small, nocturnal\r\ninsect-catching bats and the vampires. No fossil remains bridging the\r\ngap between these two orders has been discovered, nor can anyone yet\r\nexplain the steps in the acquirement of the bats' power of flight.\r\n\r\nBats are simply flying mammals, necessarily small, with the bones of\r\nthe forelimbs light, hollow, and greatly elongated, the middle finger\r\nin some cases exceeding the total length of the body. These lengthened\r\ndigits support between themselves and the hinder limbs a membrane that\r\nopens and closes much like an umbrella. This wing membrane consists of\r\na double layer of skin, one continuous with the hide of the back, the\r\nother with that of the abdomen, fused together. The surface of the wing\r\nis covered with microscopically minute hairs. To these hairs and the\r\nbulbous underlying \"end organs\" are attributed the bat's exalted sense\r\nof touch. The expanse of these leathery wings is far greater than that\r\nof most birds relatively to the size of the body, but the muscles are\r\nweaker; and the exterior thumb, with its strong claw, by means of which\r\nbats scramble about rocks and buildings, recalls the similar organ in\r\narchæopteryx. The hind limbs are small, while the knee bends backward\r\nbecause of the outward twist of the limb. This makes the foot almost\r\nuseless for walking, but fits it, with its peculiarly strengthened\r\nankle, to be extended straight backward and serve as a means of hanging\r\nthe body head downwards--the bat's ordinary attitude in rest or sleep.\r\n\r\nBats usually produce two young at a birth, and the mother carries them\r\nabout with her, they clinging to her breast, where she keeps them warm\r\nby folding them within her wings when they and she are hanging to the\r\nbranch of a tree. Nothing is made in the way of a nest.\r\n\r\nThe fruit-eating bats (division Megachiroptera) are distributed in some\r\nseventy species from East Africa to the East Indies, Japan, Australia,\r\nand Polynesia. They vary in size from an ounce in weight to some as\r\nlarge as big squirrels, and in form from the grotesque \"hammerhead\" of\r\nAfrica to the many rust-red East Indian species that come naturally by\r\ntheir name of \"flying foxes,\" and approach foxes in size. These bats\r\nfeed on all sweet fruits, and in some regions, as Java, no delicate\r\nfruit can be raised unless the tree is protected by nets. It is at\r\nnight that they make their forays, sleeping during the day in great\r\ncompanies among the branches of some chosen tree.\r\n\r\nWhere a fig tree attracts a crowd of them, we are told by Eastern\r\nwriters, the roughest fighting begins over coveted plunder, each one\r\nscreaming, clawing, biting, and struggling to seize something and\r\nget away to a secure retreat to enjoy it. No doubt these squabbles\r\nare rendered more violent by the dissipated habits in which the bats\r\nindulge during their nocturnal expeditions, for, according to Dr.\r\nFrancis Day and other observers, \"they often pass the night drinking\r\nthe toddy from the chatties in the coconut trees, which results either\r\nin their returning home in the early morning in a state of extreme and\r\nriotous intoxication, or in being found the next day at the foot of the\r\ntrees, sleeping off the effects of their midnight debauch.\"\r\n\r\nThe second division (Microchiroptera) contains the carnivorous bats,\r\nwhich include five families, two of which, the nose-leafed and the\r\ndesert bats, belong to the warmer parts of the Old World, and the\r\nothers are tropical (Emballonuridæ, and Phyllostomidæ), or have an\r\nalmost cosmopolitan range (Vespertilionidæ). In general the bats of\r\nthis division are night flyers, and retire during the day to caves,\r\nhollow trees, and dark places in old buildings. Such haunts contain\r\ngreat deposits of black guano, which in many places is gathered as a\r\nmost valuable fertilizer. The rock tombs and temples of Egypt and the\r\nEast are haunted by thousands of these tenants, and are occupied the\r\nyear through; but in cool countries the bats migrate or may go into a\r\npartial hibernation. The food of most of them, and especially of the\r\nVespertilionidæ, to which all those of the United States and western\r\nEurope belong, is exclusively insects, caught on the wing in the\r\ntwilight hours or in moonlight; and the service thus done to mankind\r\nis of much importance. In the tropics, however, several species,\r\nespecially of the family Phyllostomidæ, feed largely on fruit, being\r\nprovided with long, brush-tipped tongues with which they scrape out\r\nthe soft interior of the banana and similar fruits. Two species of\r\nthis family are the famous \"vampires\" of the American tropics. The\r\nname recalls the superstition rife in Europe in the Middle Ages as to\r\nblood-exhausting fiends which were fabled to lull their victims into\r\nunconsciousness by the slow flapping of their wings, and then deprive\r\nthem of life. The foremost of these vampires is a small reddish species\r\n(_Desmodus rufus_), whose front teeth are like keen daggers, while the\r\ncheek teeth have disappeared, having nothing to do, since the animal\r\nsubsists wholly on a liquid diet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\n                         MAN'S HUMBLE COUSINS\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now arrived at the highest division of the Mammalia, the order\r\nPrimates, a term here signifying \"first\" in rank of importance by\r\nreason of the possession of a structure and faculties superior, as a\r\nwhole, to any other class. It includes the lemurs, the monkeys and\r\nbaboons, the anthropoid apes, and mankind. Man's undeniable superiority\r\nto all the others is intellectual rather than physical (for in this\r\nor that particular he may be inferior in ability to many of the lower\r\nanimals), and is much less apparent in primitive men than in those\r\nhighly civilized.\r\n\r\nAll primates have five fingers or toes, each covered at the tip by\r\na flat nail; and in most cases the thumb or great toe, or both, are\r\n\"opposable\"--that is, may be bent around opposite the other digits so\r\nas to form a grasping organ. The higher the primate in the scale of\r\norganization the more perfectly are its forelimbs and hands adapted\r\nto seizing and handling objects, and its hind limbs to supporting and\r\nmoving the body; and the whole sole of the foot rests upon the ground.\r\nThese and other characteristics fit the primates for life in trees,\r\nwhere nearly all spend their time. The number of young, as a rule, is\r\nno more than two annually, and they are born in a helpless condition,\r\nhence they must for a period be nursed and be carried about by the\r\nmother. The food consists almost wholly of fruit and other soft or\r\neasily digested vegetable materials, insects and eggs, and the teeth\r\nare of nearly even size.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     LEMURS, GALAGOS AND AYE-AYES\r\n\r\nThe lemurs, or half-apes, are a large group of small tree-dwelling\r\nanimals that paleontology shows were in early Tertiary times much\r\nmore closely connected with monkeys than they are now; and it also\r\nshows that in a former age their ancestors were scattered all over\r\nthe temperate parts of the globe; this assists us to account for the\r\nstrange distribution of the remnants that now live--a part of them in\r\nthe Malayan archipelago and a part in central Africa and Madagascar,\r\nin which island, indeed, lemurs abound more than elsewhere, owing\r\nlargely, no doubt, to the scarcity of enemies. They differ from monkeys\r\nin having elongated jaws, giving a foxlike aspect to the face, in the\r\nwoolliness of the coat (as a rule), and in their nocturnal habits and\r\nweird cries that have been the source of many curious superstitions and\r\na reverence that no monkey ever inspired.\r\n\r\nThe most specialized of the group is a wan little Malayan creature\r\nabout the size of a small rat, with a long tail, long hind legs, and\r\ntoes ending in pads that enable the tarsier, or \"malmag,\" as it is\r\ncalled, to climb the smoothest bamboo. Its eyes are so big they seem\r\nto leave no room for cheeks. Even more curious is the aye-aye of\r\nMadagascar, which resembles a small squirrel with a terrier's face; its\r\nhind feet are like a monkey's hand, and its forefeet are composed of\r\nvery long naked fingers armed with sharp claws useful in pulling bugs\r\nand grubs out of crevices in bark, or the pulp out of fruits.\r\n\r\nThe typical lemurs have rounded heads, doglike muzzles, and a soft,\r\nthick, woolly fur of various colors that is usually extended to form a\r\nlong, bushy tail; and the largest of them, the \"babakoto\" of eastern\r\nAfrica, is as big as a cat, and makes the woods ring at night with\r\ndoleful howls. They hide in holes in trees or in leafy nests during\r\nthe day, and at night wander about in trees, or on the rocks of the\r\nmountains they frequent, in search of insects and sleeping birds and\r\ntheir eggs, etc. All the lemurs proper, and their relatives, the\r\nendrinas, belong to Madagascar. On the mainland a somewhat different\r\nrace, the galagos, abound throughout central Africa, and are renowned\r\nfor their leaping powers, general activity, and willingness to eat\r\nanything they can catch or find ripe in the way of sweet fruit. They\r\nare interesting as pets. The \"slow lemurs\" of the Malayan islands, on\r\nthe other hand, are noted for their sleepiness, moving about the trees\r\nwith such slothlike sluggishness and caution that it is a wonder they\r\never capture enough food to keep alive. They are regarded with great\r\nfear by the natives, not because they are more harmful than the other\r\nlemurs, which are also dreaded, but because of strange supernatural\r\npowers attributed to them. These ideas are older than our science, for\r\nthe name, _Lemures_, given them means \"ghosts.\"\r\n\r\nA remarkable thing about the Primates is that they show, even in\r\nman himself, many structural traits recalling the anatomy of that\r\nremote source of so many mammalian branches, the creodonts; and the\r\nlemurs seem to stand between the Insectivora and the Primates, and\r\nare certainly the most ancient part of the latter order, with many\r\naffinities to the former. In a similar way they are connected with\r\nthe monkeys and apes by the marmosets. A very suggestive fact is that\r\nthe scattered distribution of modern lemurs much resembles that of the\r\ncomparatively few existing insectivores, especially as to Madagascar,\r\nwhich was united with the continent of Africa during the earlier half\r\nof the Tertiary era.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    MARMOSETS, MONKEYS AND BABOONS\r\n\r\nThe marmosets, or \"teetees\" (titis), are a small family (Hapalidæ) of\r\nlittle, arboreal, monkeylike creatures much enjoyed as pets in the\r\nAmerican tropics, but rarely able to endure our northern winters even\r\nwhen protected most carefully from the cold. They look and act much\r\nlike pretty squirrels, have long, but not prehensile tails, and some of\r\nthem, as the \"tamarins,\" have long silky manes. They possess several\r\nlemurlike features, and, as has been said, are a connecting link\r\nbetween the lemurs and the monkeys proper.\r\n\r\nAll the monkeys of the world are members of one or the other of two\r\nfamilies only--the Cebidæ, all American, and the Cercopithidæ, confined\r\nto the Old World. They differ in several structural particulars, among\r\nothers in the number of teeth, and in the matter of bare spots of naked\r\nskin on the buttocks (not seen in the Cebidæ), in the prehensility of\r\nthe tail, exclusively American, etc.; but the most striking difference\r\nbetween the two groups is found in the nostrils. In the Old World\r\nmonkeys and apes (Catarrhines) the nostrils look downward and are close\r\ntogether; in American monkeys (Platyrrhines) they are widely separated\r\nand look outward. This absolute distinction between the Primates of the\r\ntwo hemispheres has existed as far back as the race can be traced by\r\npaleontologists, who have discovered no intermediate forms.\r\n\r\nThe American monkeys, or \"sons of Cebidæ,\" as Dr. Cope once\r\nexpressed it, comprise the capuchins (Cebus), which may be taken\r\nas the representative genus, the woolly monkeys (Lagothrix), the\r\nspider monkeys (Ateles and Eriodes), the howlers (Mycetes), the\r\nsakis (Pithecia and Brachyurus), the night monkeys or durukulis\r\n(Nyctipithecus) and the squirrel monkeys or saimiris (Chrysothrix and\r\nCallithrix). All are small, the largest having a body no more than\r\ntwenty inches in length, and are hairy or woolly, without any naked\r\ncallosities. Their headquarters are in the great forests of equatorial\r\nSouth America, which is the exclusive home of many species, some of\r\nwhich are restricted to narrow areas, the great rivers often acting as\r\nimpassable boundaries. No monkeys ascend high in the Andes, or reach\r\nthe West Coast; and none is found far south of the forests of Brazil or\r\nnorth of south-central Mexico.\r\n\r\nThey are adapted to a life in trees, and most of them are aided in\r\nsecurity in hurrying about their precarious paths through the tree tops\r\nby the fact that the tip of the tail, naked on the underside, will\r\nalmost automatically curl around a branch, gripping it so firmly that\r\nthe animal may hang by this grasp alone, leaving all four hands and\r\nfeet free for other service. Their agility, especially in the smaller\r\nlong-legged spider monkeys, is proverbial; but one must not believe the\r\nold wonder tales of \"living bridges\" and the like. Best known are the\r\ncapuchins, which furnish most of the pets and organ grinders' slaves\r\nseen in the United States; and their manner of life is substantially\r\nthat of the whole tribe, with such exceptions as that of the big-eyed\r\ndurukulis, which are strictly nocturnal in habit, and the big reddish\r\n\"howlers\" that make the forest ring with lionlike roars at certain\r\ntimes, giving the impression that a large company are howling in chorus\r\nwhen it is only a solitary old male that makes all the noise. The\r\ncapuchins, like most other species, go about in small, orderly bands,\r\nled by the oldest male, and remain most of the time in very tall trees.\r\nBates, in his \"Naturalist on the Amazons,\" describes how, when the\r\nforemost of a flock of monkeys reaches the outermost branch of a tall\r\ntree, he springs forth into the air without a moment's hesitation, and\r\nalights on the dome of yielding foliage belonging to the neighboring\r\ntree, maybe fifty feet beneath, all the rest following his example.\r\n\r\nThe Old World monkeys are, as a family, of higher grade, larger size,\r\nand greater historical interest than those of America. Fossil remains\r\nshow that the tribe is an old one, and was once able to range all\r\nover Europe; now the few half-captive and altogether mischievous apes\r\non the rock of Gibraltar represent all that remain of a species once\r\nnumerous even in northern France, and so recently as the Pleistocene.\r\nThis ape is a macaque (Macacus), a genus that otherwise is purely\r\nAsiatic and contains some of the most celebrated of the monkeys. Thus,\r\nthe suitably named pig-tailed macaque of the Far East is trained, in\r\nSumatra and Borneo, to climb the coconut palms and select and throw\r\ndown ripe nuts--the most really useful thing to the credit of monkeys;\r\nthe Japanese species is the one that is so much used in the decorative\r\ndesigns of that artistic people; and the best known of all is the\r\ncommon Bengal or rhesus monkey, which is revered by some sects of\r\nHindus, and is treated with tolerance or made a pet of, or an aid to\r\njugglers, throughout India. Several other macaques are common pets and\r\nservants in the East. The macaques go about in flocks, and often come\r\nto the ground. All have the habit of cramming food into their cheek\r\npouches for mastication at leisure. The majority of the species are\r\nvery docile when young.\r\n\r\nClosely related to the macaques are the mangabeys, or white-eyelidded\r\nmonkeys of West Africa, and the central African genus Cercopithecus,\r\nwhich includes many small-sized, handsome, tree-living kinds, of which\r\nthe most widely known is the diana monkey, whose long fringe of white\r\nhair hanging from its neck and chest is in much demand in the fur\r\nmarket. Even nearer relatives are those interesting but often repulsive\r\ncreatures, the baboons, between which and macaques stands the doglike,\r\nstub-tailed, ground-keeping black ape of Celebes. This eastern instance\r\nof an otherwise African group, like the single western macaque,\r\nindicates, what fossil remains prove, that both genera were once far\r\nmore wide-ranging than at present.\r\n\r\nThe African baboons, of which there are about a dozen species, present\r\nstriking peculiarities in appearance, and all are much alike. In size\r\nthey vary from the bigness of a spaniel to that of a mastiff, and a\r\ncomparison with dogs is apt, for these apes go about habitually on\r\nall fours, their limbs are stout and of about equal length, and their\r\nheads and muzzles are canine; hence the ancient name _cynocephali_,\r\ndog-headed. In some, as the mandrill, the naked nose is swollen at the\r\nsides like a hog's snout, thrown into ridges and colored black, pale\r\npink, or blue and purple; while the great callosities on the stern are\r\nof the same or contrasted colors. The fur is blackish, or yellowish or\r\ngreenish, grizzled by the fact that every hair is ringed with various\r\ncolors; or the coat may be party-colored. They go in bands, sometimes\r\nexceeding one hundred individuals of all ages, and choose for their\r\nlairs cliffs and rocky ridges full of crevices and thickets, such as\r\nthe extraordinary Black Rocks of Angola, where the yellow baboon dwells\r\nin thousands, and subsists mainly on lichens. In such places they are\r\nsafe against any enemies except leopards (which the old males are said\r\nto be able to vanquish) and the larger serpents or birds of prey;\r\nand these can make away only with the young now and then. Dogs dare\r\nnot attack full-sized baboons, which have been seen again and again\r\ngoing fearlessly to the aid of some little one that dogs have tried to\r\nseize. Their sense of smell is amazingly keen, especially for hidden\r\nwater springs in the desert. It is recorded that the Bushmen of the\r\nKalahari plains used to train captives to help them search for water\r\nwhen famine was impending; and undoubtedly the observation of what\r\nroots, etc., these animals were accustomed to eat taught the earliest\r\nhuman venturers into these regions what might be used there in the way\r\nof food. Baboons also eat lizards and the like, and are fond of honey\r\nand certain gums. With these habits it is not surprising that they are\r\neverywhere exceedingly harmful to plantations, tearing up or trampling\r\ndown more than they can consume, and destroying a field in a night.\r\nSome of these baboons are as tamable and teachable as other monkeys,\r\nbut they grow unruly and ferocious as they become old. They were tamed\r\nand trained in ancient Egypt, where a religious sect held the shaggy\r\nArabian species (_Cynocephalus hamadryas_) to be sacred to Thoth, whose\r\nstatues are a human figure with a baboon's head.\r\n\r\n\r\n                GIBBON, CHIMPANZEE, GORILLA, ORANG-UTAN\r\n\r\nThis brings us to the anthropoid (\"manlike\") apes of the family\r\nSimiidæ, which differ from the inferior apes that have been described\r\nin fewer particulars than their size and appearance might suggest.\r\nThoroughly arboreal for the most part, when these apes come to the\r\nground they progress in a semi-erect fashion. Moreover when they put\r\ntheir hands upon the ground to aid in walking, they do not rest their\r\nweight, as do the lower apes, upon the flat of the hand, but upon the\r\nback of the fingers. None of the anthropoids has a tail.\r\n\r\nThe gibbons are an Indo-Malayan group of monkeylike anthropoids with\r\nsmall, long-nosed faces, and arms so long that when the gibbon stands\r\nerect the fingers touch the ground. By means of these long arms they\r\nswing themselves through the tree tops with astonishing speed, and are\r\nadept at climbing and leaping about the mountain slopes that are their\r\nfavorite resorts. All the gibbons are noted for their far-carrying\r\nvoices, and often a band will utter weird howls in chorus answered by\r\nanother band, so that the forest is filled with indescribable noises.\r\nThe largest is the jet black, Sumatran \"siamang,\" three feet tall.\r\n\r\nIn the same region, precisely eastern Sumatra and Borneo, lives a\r\nlarger relative, the orang-utan (\"man of the woods\"), or \"mias,\" as it\r\nis known to the Dyaks. Like the gibbons it feeds on leaves, buds and\r\nsoft fruits, especially the big, pulpy durian; and also like them is\r\nshy and mild in disposition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GORILLAS AND GIBBONS\r\n  The five upper figures are young gorillas in various postures; the\r\n  three lower are adult gibbons. (Lydekker.)]\r\n\r\nThis Malayan ape is smaller and weaker than its African cousins,\r\nmales standing not more than four feet six inches, and weighing 160\r\npounds, while the females are smaller. The body is bulky, the belly\r\nprotuberant, and the legs very short, while the arms are so long that\r\nthe fingers hang down to the ankle. The coat is a variable dark brick\r\nred and long, forming a beard in old males. The head is short and high,\r\nwith the bony crest of the skull and the ridge over the eyes less\r\nprominent than in the gorilla; while the nose is insignificant, and the\r\njaws are large and protrusive, with a long smooth upper lip. The eyes\r\nhave a pleading expression, the ears are small and closely appressed,\r\nand many of the older males have the cheeks greatly and distinctively\r\nbroadened by flat callosities. Lastly, although its brain is most\r\nlike that of man, the orang-utan is inferior, in general, to both the\r\ngorilla and the chimpanzee.\r\n\r\nThe chimpanzee and gorilla belong together, not only because both are\r\nAfrican, but because they are more closely related to one another\r\nthan to the Malayan anthropoids. The chimpanzee is to be found in the\r\nequatorial forests north of the Congo, and also all along the upper\r\nvalley of the Nile and about the Great Lakes; but the gorilla seems\r\nto be restricted to the rough coastal region between the Congo and\r\nKamerun. Both are black-haired apes, growing nearly to the height of\r\na man of medium size, but with short legs, very long arms, massive\r\nchests and shoulders, and huge strength. The face and palms of the\r\nchimpanzee are pale flesh color, those of the gorilla black. Both\r\nmake their homes in trees, feeding on succulent leaves, sprouts and\r\nfruit, and like the orang-utans, making nightly platform like nests of\r\nbranches on which to sleep; but the old male gorilla is said to sleep\r\non the ground at the base of the tree in which its family reposes. Both\r\nspend much time on the ground hunting for food, and they invade the\r\nplantations of the Negroes, who are greatly afraid of them, and wreak\r\nmuch damage there. Dr. Garner, whose investigations of their habits,\r\nin his attempt to learn whether they and the monkeys of the region\r\nhad anything that might be called rudiments of a language, resulted\r\nin adding much of importance in regard to them, reported that despite\r\nits superior strength, the gorilla was in constant fear of the more\r\nactive chimpanzee, and fled whenever one approached. The best and most\r\nrecent observations indicate that the gorilla is not quarrelsome and\r\naggressive, but disposed to hide away from and avoid men whenever it\r\ncan, rather than to attack them. Nevertheless all these great apes are\r\ndebased, savage brutes of which nothing good may be said, despite the\r\nfact that when caught young chimpanzees, at least, prove docile and\r\nable to learn some simple imitations of human behavior; but in old age\r\neven they become sullen and dangerous toward trainers who have treated\r\nthem with uniform kindness. They are base caricatures of men--side\r\nlines of development that have proved failures in nature's experiments\r\ntoward making something out of simian material.\r\n\r\nThe successful line of human descent began far back of their earliest\r\nspecific history, and has developed quite independent of these brutal\r\noffshoots from some parental stem of which we have no definite\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's note:\r\n\r\nSmall capitals have been rendered in full capitals.\r\n\r\noe-ligatures have been converted to oe.\r\n\r\nA number of minor spelling errors have been corrected without note.",
