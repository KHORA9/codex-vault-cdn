For a long time the Slav\r\npeople--who, after the battle of Kosovopjolje, in which the Turks\r\ndefeated the Servians, retired to the confines of the present\r\nMontenegro, Dalmatia, Herzegovina and Bosnia, and \"Borderland\" of\r\nAustria--knew what it was to deal, as our Western pioneers did, with\r\nfoes ceaselessly fretting against their frontier; and the races of\r\nthese countries, through their strenuous struggle against the armies\r\nof the Crescent, have developed notable qualities of bravery and\r\nsagacity, while maintaining a patriotism and independence unsurpassed\r\nin any other nation.\r\n\r\nIt was in this interesting border region, and from among these valiant\r\nEastern folk, that Nikola Tesla was born in the year 1857, and the\r\nfact that he, to-day, finds himself in America and one of our foremost\r\nelectricians, is striking evidence of the extraordinary attractiveness\r\nalike of electrical pursuits and of the country where electricity\r\nenjoys its widest application. Mr. Tesla's native place was Smiljan,\r\nLika, where his father was an eloquent clergyman of the Greek Church,\r\nin which, by the way, his family is still prominently represented. His\r\nmother enjoyed great fame throughout the countryside for her skill and\r\noriginality in needlework, and doubtless transmitted her ingenuity to\r\nNikola; though it naturally took another and more masculine direction.\r\n\r\nThe boy was early put to his books, and upon his father's removal to\r\nGospic he spent four years in the public school, and later, three\r\nyears in the Real School, as it is called. His escapades were such as\r\nmost quick witted boys go through, although he varied the programme on\r\none occasion by getting imprisoned in a remote mountain chapel rarely\r\nvisited for service; and on another occasion by falling headlong into\r\na huge kettle of boiling milk, just drawn from the paternal herds. A\r\nthird curious episode was that connected with his efforts to fly when,\r\nattempting to navigate the air with the aid of an old umbrella, he\r\nhad, as might be expected, a very bad fall, and was laid up for six\r\nweeks.\r\n\r\nAbout this period he began to take delight in arithmetic and physics.\r\nOne queer notion he had was to work out everything by three or the\r\npower of three. He was now sent to an aunt at Cartstatt, Croatia, to\r\nfinish his studies in what is known as the Higher Real School. It was\r\nthere that, coming from the rural fastnesses, he saw a steam engine\r\nfor the first time with a pleasure that he remembers to this day. At\r\nCartstatt he was so diligent as to compress the four years' course\r\ninto three, and graduated in 1873. Returning home during an epidemic\r\nof cholera, he was stricken down by the disease and suffered so\r\nseriously from the consequences that his studies were interrupted for\r\nfully two years. But the time was not wasted, for he had become\r\npassionately fond of experimenting, and as much as his means and\r\nleisure permitted devoted his energies to electrical study and\r\ninvestigation. Up to this period it had been his father's intention to\r\nmake a priest of him, and the idea hung over the young physicist like\r\na very sword of Damocles. Finally he prevailed upon his worthy but\r\nreluctant sire to send him to Gratz in Austria to finish his studies\r\nat the Polytechnic School, and to prepare for work as professor of\r\nmathematics and physics. At Gratz he saw and operated a Gramme machine\r\nfor the first time, and was so struck with the objections to the use\r\nof commutators and brushes that he made up his mind there and then to\r\nremedy that defect in dynamo-electric machines. In the second year of\r\nhis course he abandoned the intention of becoming a teacher and took\r\nup the engineering curriculum. After three years of absence he\r\nreturned home, sadly, to see his father die; but, having resolved to\r\nsettle down in Austria, and recognizing the value of linguistic\r\nacquirements, he went to Prague and then to Buda-Pesth with the view\r\nof mastering the languages he deemed necessary. Up to this time he had\r\nnever realized the enormous sacrifices that his parents had made in\r\npromoting his education, but he now began to feel the pinch and to\r\ngrow unfamiliar with the image of Francis Joseph I. There was\r\nconsiderable lag between his dispatches and the corresponding\r\nremittance from home; and when the mathematical expression for the\r\nvalue of the lag assumed the shape of an eight laid flat on its back,\r\nMr. Tesla became a very fair example of high thinking and plain\r\nliving, but he made up his mind to the struggle and determined to go\r\nthrough depending solely on his own resources. Not desiring the fame\r\nof a faster, he cast about for a livelihood, and through the help of\r\nfriends he secured a berth as assistant in the engineering department\r\nof the government telegraphs. The salary was five dollars a week. This\r\nbrought him into direct contact with practical electrical work and\r\nideas, but it is needless to say that his means did not admit of much\r\nexperimenting. By the time he had extracted several hundred thousand\r\nsquare and cube roots for the public benefit, the limitations,\r\nfinancial and otherwise, of the position had become painfully\r\napparent, and he concluded that the best thing to do was to make a\r\nvaluable invention. He proceeded at once to make inventions, but their\r\nvalue was visible only to the eye of faith, and they brought no grist\r\nto the mill. Just at this time the telephone made its appearance in\r\nHungary, and the success of that great invention determined his\r\ncareer, hopeless as the profession had thus far seemed to him. He\r\nassociated himself at once with telephonic work, and made various\r\ntelephonic inventions, including an operative repeater; but it did not\r\ntake him long to discover that, being so remote from the scenes of\r\nelectrical activity, he was apt to spend time on aims and results\r\nalready reached by others, and to lose touch. Longing for new\r\nopportunities and anxious for the development of which he felt himself\r\npossible, if once he could place himself within the genial and direct\r\ninfluences of the gulf streams of electrical thought, he broke away\r\nfrom the ties and traditions of the past, and in 1881 made his way to\r\nParis. Arriving in that city, the ardent young Likan obtained\r\nemployment as an electrical engineer with one of the largest electric\r\nlighting companies. The next year he went to Strasburg to install a\r\nplant, and on returning to Paris sought to carry out a number of ideas\r\nthat had now ripened into inventions. About this time, however, the\r\nremarkable progress of America in electrical industry attracted his\r\nattention, and once again staking everything on a single throw, he\r\ncrossed the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nMr. Tesla buckled down to work as soon as he landed on these shores,\r\nput his best thought and skill into it, and soon saw openings for his\r\ntalent. In a short while a proposition was made to him to start his\r\nown company, and, accepting the terms, he at once worked up a\r\npractical system of arc lighting, as well as a potential method of\r\ndynamo regulation, which in one form is now known as the \"third brush\r\nregulation.\" He also devised a thermo-magnetic motor and other kindred\r\ndevices, about which little was published, owing to legal\r\ncomplications. Early in 1887 the Tesla Electric Company of New York\r\nwas formed, and not long after that Mr. Tesla produced his admirable\r\nand epoch-marking motors for multiphase alternating currents, in\r\nwhich, going back to his ideas of long ago, he evolved machines having\r\nneither commutator nor brushes. It will be remembered that about the\r\ntime that Mr. Tesla brought out his motors, and read his thoughtful\r\npaper before the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, Professor\r\nFerraris, in Europe, published his discovery of principles analogous\r\nto those enunciated by Mr. Tesla. There is no doubt, however, that Mr.\r\nTesla was an independent inventor of this rotary field motor, for\r\nalthough anticipated in dates by Ferraris, he could not have known\r\nabout Ferraris' work as it had not been published. Professor Ferraris\r\nstated himself, with becoming modesty, that he did not think Tesla\r\ncould have known of his (Ferraris') experiments at that time, and adds\r\nthat he thinks Tesla was an independent and original inventor of this\r\nprinciple. With such an acknowledgment from Ferraris there can be\r\nlittle doubt about Tesla's originality in this matter.\r\n\r\nMr. Tesla's work in this field was wonderfully timely, and its worth\r\nwas promptly appreciated in various quarters. The Tesla patents were\r\nacquired by the Westinghouse Electric Company, who undertook to\r\ndevelop his motor and to apply it to work of different kinds. Its use\r\nin mining, and its employment in printing, ventilation, etc., was\r\ndescribed and illustrated in _The Electrical World_ some years ago.\r\nThe immense stimulus that the announcement of Mr. Tesla's work gave to\r\nthe study of alternating current motors would, in itself, be enough to\r\nstamp him as a leader.\r\n\r\nMr. Tesla is only 35 years of age. He is tall and spare with a\r\nclean-cut, thin, refined face, and eyes that recall all the stories\r\none has read of keenness of vision and phenomenal ability to see\r\nthrough things. He is an omnivorous reader, who never forgets; and he\r\npossesses the peculiar facility in languages that enables the least\r\neducated native of eastern Europe to talk and write in at least half a\r\ndozen tongues. A more congenial companion cannot be desired for the\r\nhours when one \"pours out heart affluence in discursive talk,\" and\r\nwhen the conversation, dealing at first with things near at hand and\r\nnext to us, reaches out and rises to the greater questions of life,\r\nduty and destiny.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1890 he severed his connection with the Westinghouse\r\nCompany, since which time he has devoted himself entirely to the study\r\nof alternating currents of high frequencies and very high potentials,\r\nwith which study he is at present engaged. No comment is necessary on\r\nhis interesting achievements in this field; the famous London lecture\r\npublished in this volume is a proof in itself. His first lecture on\r\nhis researches in this new branch of electricity, which he may be said\r\nto have created, was delivered before the American Institute of\r\nElectrical Engineers on May 20, 1891, and remains one of the most\r\ninteresting papers read before that society. It will be found\r\nreprinted in full in _The Electrical World_, July 11, 1891. Its\r\npublication excited such interest abroad that he received numerous\r\nrequests from English and French electrical engineers and scientists\r\nto repeat it in those countries, the result of which has been the\r\ninteresting lecture published in this volume.\r\n\r\nThe present lecture presupposes a knowledge of the former, but it may\r\nbe read and understood by any one even though he has not read the\r\nearlier one. It forms a sort of continuation of the latter, and\r\nincludes chiefly the results of his researches since that time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENTS WITH ALTERNATE CURRENTS OF HIGH POTENTIAL AND HIGH FREQUENCY\r\n\r\n\r\nI cannot find words to express how deeply I feel the honor of\r\naddressing some of the foremost thinkers of the present time, and so\r\nmany able scientific men, engineers and electricians, of the country\r\ngreatest in scientific achievements.\r\n\r\nThe results which I have the honor to present before such a gathering\r\nI cannot call my own. There are among you not a few who can lay better\r\nclaim than myself on any feature of merit which this work may contain.\r\nI need not mention many names which are world-known--names of those\r\namong you who are recognized as the leaders in this enchanting\r\nscience; but one, at least, I must mention--a name which could not be\r\nomitted in a demonstration of this kind. It is a name associated with\r\nthe most beautiful invention ever made: it is Crookes!\r\n\r\nWhen I was at college, a good time ago, I read, in a translation (for\r\nthen I was not familiar with your magnificent language), the\r\ndescription of his experiments on radiant matter. I read it only once\r\nin my life--that time--yet every detail about that charming work I\r\ncan remember this day. Few are the books, let me say, which can make\r\nsuch an impression upon the mind of a student.\r\n\r\nBut if, on the present occasion, I mention this name as one of many\r\nyour institution can boast of, it is because I have more than one\r\nreason to do so. For what I have to tell you and to show you this\r\nevening concerns, in a large measure, that same vague world which\r\nProfessor Crookes has so ably explored; and, more than this, when I\r\ntrace back the mental process which led me to these advances--which\r\neven by myself cannot be considered trifling, since they are so\r\nappreciated by you--I believe that their real origin, that which\r\nstarted me to work in this direction, and brought me to them, after a\r\nlong period of constant thought, was that fascinating little book\r\nwhich I read many years ago.\r\n\r\nAnd now that I have made a feeble effort to express my homage and\r\nacknowledge my indebtedness to him and others among you, I will make a\r\nsecond effort, which I hope you will not find so feeble as the first,\r\nto entertain you.\r\n\r\nGive me leave to introduce the subject in a few words.\r\n\r\nA short time ago I had the honor to bring before our American\r\nInstitute of Electrical Engineers[A] some results then arrived at by\r\nme in a novel line of work. I need not assure you that the many\r\nevidences which I have received that English scientific men and\r\nengineers were interested in this work have been for me a great\r\nreward and encouragement. I will not dwell upon the experiments\r\nalready described, except with the view of completing, or more clearly\r\nexpressing, some ideas advanced by me before, and also with the view\r\nof rendering the study here presented self-contained, and my remarks\r\non the subject of this evening's lecture consistent.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: For Mr. Tesla's American lecture on this subject see THE\r\nELECTRICAL WORLD of July 11, 1891, and for a report of his French\r\nlecture see THE ELECTRICAL WORLD of March 26, 1892.]\r\n\r\nThis investigation, then, it goes without saying, deals with\r\nalternating currents, and, to be more precise, with alternating\r\ncurrents of high potential and high frequency. Just in how much a very\r\nhigh frequency is essential for the production of the results\r\npresented is a question which even with my present experience, would\r\nembarrass me to answer. Some of the experiments may be performed with\r\nlow frequencies; but very high frequencies are desirable, not only on\r\naccount of the many effects secured by their use, but also as a\r\nconvenient means of obtaining, in the induction apparatus employed,\r\nthe high potentials, which in their turn are necessary to the\r\ndemonstration of most of the experiments here contemplated.\r\n\r\nOf the various branches of electrical investigation, perhaps the most\r\ninteresting and immediately the most promising is that dealing with\r\nalternating currents. The progress in this branch of applied science\r\nhas been so great in recent years that it justifies the most sanguine\r\nhopes. Hardly have we become familiar with one fact, when novel\r\nexperiences are met with and new avenues of research are opened. Even\r\nat this hour possibilities not dreamed of before are, by the use of\r\nthese currents, partly realized. As in nature all is ebb and tide, all\r\nis wave motion, so it seems that; in all branches of industry\r\nalternating currents--electric wave motion--will have the sway.\r\n\r\nOne reason, perhaps, why this branch of science is being so rapidly\r\ndeveloped is to be found in the interest which is attached to its\r\nexperimental study. We wind a simple ring of iron with coils; we\r\nestablish the connections to the generator, and with wonder and\r\ndelight we note the effects of strange forces which we bring into\r\nplay, which allow us to transform, to transmit and direct energy at\r\nwill. We arrange the circuits properly, and we see the mass of iron\r\nand wires behave as though it were endowed with life, spinning a heavy\r\narmature, through invisible connections, with great speed and\r\npower--with the energy possibly conveyed from a great distance. We\r\nobserve how the energy of an alternating current traversing the wire\r\nmanifests itself--not so much in the wire as in the surrounding\r\nspace--in the most surprising manner, taking the forms of heat, light,\r\nmechanical energy, and, most surprising of all, even chemical\r\naffinity. All these observations fascinate us, and fill us with an\r\nintense desire to know more about the nature of these phenomena. Each\r\nday we go to our work in the hope of discovering,--in the hope that\r\nsome one, no matter who, may find a solution of one of the pending\r\ngreat problems,--and each succeeding day we return to our task with\r\nrenewed ardor; and even if we _are_ unsuccessful, our work has not\r\nbeen in vain, for in these strivings, in these efforts, we have found\r\nhours of untold pleasure, and we have directed our energies to the\r\nbenefit of mankind.\r\n\r\nWe may take--at random, if you choose--any of the many experiments\r\nwhich may be performed with alternating currents; a few of which\r\nonly, and by no means the most striking, form the subject of this\r\nevening's demonstration: they are all equally interesting, equally\r\ninciting to thought.\r\n\r\nHere is a simple glass tube from which the air has been partially\r\nexhausted. I take hold of it; I bring my body in contact with a wire\r\nconveying alternating currents of high potential, and the tube in my\r\nhand is brilliantly lighted. In whatever position I may put it,\r\nwherever I may move it in space, as far as I can reach, its soft,\r\npleasing light persists with undiminished brightness.\r\n\r\nHere is an exhausted bulb suspended from a single wire. Standing on an\r\ninsulated support. I grasp it, and a platinum button mounted in it is\r\nbrought to vivid incandescence.\r\n\r\nHere, attached to a leading wire, is another bulb, which, as I touch\r\nits metallic socket, is filled with magnificent colors of\r\nphosphorescent light.\r\n\r\nHere still another, which by my fingers' touch casts a shadow--the\r\nCrookes shadow, of the stem inside of it.\r\n\r\nHere, again, insulated as I stand on this platform, I bring my body in\r\ncontact with one of the terminals of the secondary of this induction\r\ncoil--with the end of a wire many miles long--and you see streams of\r\nlight break forth from its distant end, which is set in violent\r\nvibration.\r\n\r\nHere, once more, I attach these two plates of wire gauze to the\r\nterminals of the coil. I set them a distance apart, and I set the coil\r\nto work. You may see a small spark pass between the plates. I insert a\r\nthick plate of one of the best dielectrics between them, and instead\r\nof rendering altogether impossible, as we are used to expect, I _aid_\r\nthe passage of the discharge, which, as I insert the plate, merely\r\nchanges in appearance and assumes the form of luminous streams.\r\n\r\nIs there, I ask, can there be, a more interesting study than that of\r\nalternating currents?\r\n\r\nIn all these investigations, in all these experiments, which are so\r\nvery, very interesting, for many years past--ever since the greatest\r\nexperimenter who lectured in this hall discovered its principle--we\r\nhave had a steady companion, an appliance familiar to every one, a\r\nplaything once, a thing of momentous importance now--the induction\r\ncoil. There is no dearer appliance to the electrician. From the ablest\r\namong you, I dare say, down to the inexperienced student, to your\r\nlecturer, we all have passed many delightful hours in experimenting\r\nwith the induction coil. We have watched its play, and thought and\r\npondered over the beautiful phenomena which it disclosed to our\r\nravished eyes. So well known is this apparatus, so familiar are these\r\nphenomena to every one, that my courage nearly fails me when I think\r\nthat I have ventured to address so able an audience, that I have\r\nventured to entertain you with that same old subject. Here in reality\r\nis the same apparatus, and here are the same phenomena, only the\r\napparatus is operated somewhat differently, the phenomena are\r\npresented in a different aspect. Some of the results we find as\r\nexpected, others surprise us, but all captivate our attention, for in\r\nscientific investigation each novel result achieved may be the centre\r\nof a new departure, each novel fact learned may lead to important\r\ndevelopments.\r\n\r\nUsually in operating an induction coil we have set up a vibration of\r\nmoderate frequency in the primary, either by means of an interrupter\r\nor break, or by the use of an alternator. Earlier English\r\ninvestigators, to mention only Spottiswoode and J.E.H. Gordon, have\r\nused a rapid break in connection with the coil. Our knowledge and\r\nexperience of to-day enables us to see clearly why these coils under\r\nthe conditions of the tests did not disclose any remarkable phenomena,\r\nand why able experimenters failed to perceive many of the curious\r\neffects which have since been observed.\r\n\r\nIn the experiments such as performed this evening, we operate the coil\r\neither from a specially constructed alternator capable of giving many\r\nthousands of reversals of current per second, or, by disruptively\r\ndischarging a condenser through the primary, we set up a vibration in\r\nthe secondary circuit of a frequency of many hundred thousand or\r\nmillions per second, if we so desire; and in using either of these\r\nmeans we enter a field as yet unexplored.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to pursue an investigation in any novel line without\r\nfinally making some interesting observation or learning some useful\r\nfact. That this statement is applicable to the subject of this lecture\r\nthe many curious and unexpected phenomena which we observe afford a\r\nconvincing proof. By way of illustration, take for instance the most\r\nobvious phenomena, those of the discharge of the induction coil.\r\n\r\nHere is a coil which is operated by currents vibrating with extreme\r\nrapidity, obtained by disruptively discharging a Leyden jar. It would\r\nnot surprise a student were the lecturer to say that the secondary of\r\nthis coil consists of a small length of comparatively stout wire; it\r\nwould not surprise him were the lecturer to state that, in spite of\r\nthis, the coil is capable of giving any potential which the best\r\ninsulation of the turns is able to withstand: but although he may be\r\nprepared, and even be indifferent as to the anticipated result, yet\r\nthe aspect of the discharge of the coil will surprise and interest\r\nhim. Every one is familiar with the discharge of an ordinary coil; it\r\nneed not be reproduced here. But, by way of contrast, here is a form\r\nof discharge of a coil, the primary current of which is vibrating\r\nseveral hundred thousand times per second. The discharge of an\r\nordinary coil appears as a simple line or band of light. The discharge\r\nof this coil appears in the form of powerful brushes and luminous\r\nstreams issuing from all points of the two straight wires attached to\r\nthe terminals of the secondary. (Fig. 1.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--DISCHARGE BETWEEN TWO WIRES WITH FREQUENCIES\r\nOF A FEW HUNDRED THOUSAND PER SECOND.]\r\n\r\nNow compare this phenomenon which you have just witnessed with the\r\ndischarge of a Holtz or Wimshurst machine--that other interesting\r\nappliance so dear to the experimenter. What a difference there is\r\nbetween these phenomena! And yet, had I made the necessary\r\narrangements--which could have been made easily, were it not that they\r\nwould interfere with other experiments--I could have produced with\r\nthis coil sparks which, had I the coil hidden from your view and only\r\ntwo knobs exposed, even the keenest observer among you would find it\r\ndifficult, if not impossible, to distinguish from those of an\r\ninfluence or friction machine. This may be done in many ways--for\r\ninstance, by operating the induction coil which charges the condenser\r\nfrom an alternating-current machine of very low frequency, and\r\npreferably adjusting the discharge circuit so that there are no\r\noscillations set up in it. We then obtain in the secondary circuit, if\r\nthe knobs are of the required size and properly set, a more or less\r\nrapid succession of sparks of great intensity and small quantity,\r\nwhich possess the same brilliancy, and are accompanied by the same\r\nsharp crackling sound, as those obtained from a friction or influence\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\nAnother way is to pass through two primary circuits, having a common\r\nsecondary, two currents of a slightly different period, which produce\r\nin the secondary circuit sparks occurring at comparatively long\r\nintervals. But, even with the means at hand this evening, I may\r\nsucceed in imitating the spark of a Holtz machine. For this purpose I\r\nestablish between the terminals of the coil which charges the\r\ncondenser a long, unsteady arc, which is periodically interrupted by\r\nthe upward current of air produced by it. To increase the current of\r\nair I place on each side of the arc, and close to it, a large plate of\r\nmica. The condenser charged from this coil discharges into the primary\r\ncircuit of a second coil through a small air gap, which is necessary\r\nto produce a sudden rush of current through the primary. The scheme of\r\nconnections in the present experiment is indicated in Fig. 2.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--IMITATING THE SPARK OF A HOLTZ MACHINE.]\r\n\r\nG is an ordinarily constructed alternator, supplying the primary P of\r\nan induction coil, the secondary S of which charges the condensers or\r\njars CC. The terminals of the secondary are connected to the inside\r\ncoatings of the jars, the outer coatings being connected to the ends\r\nof the primary pp of a second induction coil. This primary pp has a\r\nsmall air gap ab.\r\n\r\nThe secondary s of this coil is provided with knobs or spheres KK of\r\nthe proper size and set at a distance suitable for the experiment.\r\n\r\nA long arc is established between the terminals AB of the first\r\ninduction coil. MM are the mica plates.\r\n\r\nEach time the arc is broken between A and B the jars are quickly\r\ncharged and discharged through the primary pp, producing a snapping\r\nspark between the knobs KK. Upon the arc forming between A and B the\r\npotential falls, and the jars cannot be charged to such high potential\r\nas to break through the air gap ab until the arc is again broken by\r\nthe draught.\r\n\r\nIn this manner sudden impulses, at long intervals, are produced in the\r\nprimary pp, which in the secondary s give a corresponding number of\r\nimpulses of great intensity. If the secondary knobs or spheres, KK,\r\nare of the proper size, the sparks show much resemblance to those of a\r\nHoltz machine.\r\n\r\nBut these two effects, which to the eye appear so very different, are\r\nonly two of the many discharge phenomena. We only need to change the\r\nconditions of the test, and again we make other observations of\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nWhen, instead of operating the induction coil as in the last two\r\nexperiments, we operate it from a high frequency alternator, as in the\r\nnext experiment, a systematic study of the phenomena is rendered much\r\nmore easy. In such case, in varying the strength and frequency of the\r\ncurrents through the primary, we may observe five distinct forms of\r\ndischarge, which I have described in my former paper on the subject[A]\r\nbefore the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, May 20, 1891.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: See THE ELECTRICAL WORLD, July 11, 1891.]\r\n\r\nIt would take too much time, and it would lead us too far from the\r\nsubject presented this evening, to reproduce all these forms, but it\r\nseems to me desirable to show you one of them. It is a brush\r\ndischarge, which is interesting in more than one respect. Viewed from\r\na near position it resembles much a jet of gas escaping under great\r\npressure. We know that the phenomenon is due to the agitation of the\r\nmolecules near the terminal, and we anticipate that some heat must be\r\ndeveloped by the impact of the molecules against the terminal or\r\nagainst each other. Indeed, we find that the brush is hot, and only a\r\nlittle thought leads us to the conclusion that, could we but reach\r\nsufficiently high frequencies, we could produce a brush which would\r\ngive intense light and heat, and which would resemble in every\r\nparticular an ordinary flame, save, perhaps, that both phenomena might\r\nnot be due to the same agent--save, perhaps, that chemical affinity\r\nmight not be _electrical_ in its nature.\r\n\r\nAs the production of heat and light is here due to the impact of the\r\nmolecules, or atoms of air, or something else besides, and, as we can\r\naugment the energy simply by raising the potential, we might, even\r\nwith frequencies obtained from a dynamo machine, intensify the action\r\nto such a degree as to bring the terminal to melting heat. But with\r\nsuch low frequencies we would have to deal always with something of\r\nthe nature of an electric current. If I approach a conducting object\r\nto the brush, a thin little spark passes, yet, even with the\r\nfrequencies used this evening, the tendency to spark is not very\r\ngreat. So, for instance, if I hold a metallic sphere at some distance\r\nabove the terminal you may see the whole space between the terminal\r\nand sphere illuminated by the streams without the spark passing; and\r\nwith the much higher frequencies obtainable by the disruptive\r\ndischarge of a condenser, were it not for the sudden impulses, which\r\nare comparatively few in number, sparking would not occur even at very\r\nsmall distances. However, with incomparably higher frequencies, which\r\nwe may yet find means to produce efficiently, and provided that\r\nelectric impulses of such high frequencies could be transmitted\r\nthrough a conductor, the electrical characteristics of the brush\r\ndischarge would completely vanish--no spark would pass, no shock would\r\nbe felt--yet we would still have to deal with an _electric_\r\nphenomenon, but in the broad, modern interpretation of the word. In my\r\nfirst paper before referred to I have pointed out the curious\r\nproperties of the brush, and described the best manner of producing\r\nit, but I have thought it worth while to endeavor to express myself\r\nmore clearly in regard to this phenomenon, because of its absorbing\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nWhen a coil is operated with currents of very high frequency,\r\nbeautiful brush effects may be produced, even if the coil be of\r\ncomparatively small dimensions. The experimenter may vary them in\r\nmany ways, and, if it were nothing else, they afford a pleasing sight.\r\nWhat adds to their interest is that they may be produced with one\r\nsingle terminal as well as with two--in fact, often better with one\r\nthan with two.\r\n\r\nBut of all the discharge phenomena observed, the most pleasing to the\r\neye, and the most instructive, are those observed with a coil which is\r\noperated by means of the disruptive discharge of a condenser. The\r\npower of the brushes, the abundance of the sparks, when the conditions\r\nare patiently adjusted, is often amazing. With even a very small coil,\r\nif it be so well insulated as to stand a difference of potential of\r\nseveral thousand volts per turn, the sparks may be so abundant that\r\nthe whole coil may appear a complete mass of fire.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough the sparks, when the terminals of the coil are set at\r\na considerable distance, seem to dart in every possible direction as\r\nthough the terminals were perfectly independent of each other. As the\r\nsparks would soon destroy the insulation it is necessary to prevent\r\nthem. This is best done by immersing the coil in a good liquid\r\ninsulator, such as boiled-out oil. Immersion in a liquid may be\r\nconsidered almost an absolute necessity for the continued and\r\nsuccessful working of such a coil.\r\n\r\nIt is of course out of the question, in an experimental lecture, with\r\nonly a few minutes at disposal for the performance of each experiment,\r\nto show these discharge phenomena to advantage, as to produce each\r\nphenomenon at its best a very careful adjustment is required. But even\r\nif imperfectly produced, as they are likely to be this evening, they\r\nare sufficiently striking to interest an intelligent audience.\r\n\r\nBefore showing some of these curious effects I must, for the sake of\r\ncompleteness, give a short description of the coil and other apparatus\r\nused in the experiments with the disruptive discharge this evening.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--DISRUPTIVE DISCHARGE COIL.]\r\n\r\nIt is contained in a box B (Fig. 3) of thick boards of hard wood,\r\ncovered on the outside with zinc sheet Z, which is carefully soldered\r\nall around. It might be advisable, in a strictly scientific\r\ninvestigation, when accuracy is of great importance, to do away with\r\nthe metal cover, as it might introduce many errors, principally on\r\naccount of its complex action upon the coil, as a condenser of very\r\nsmall capacity and as an electrostatic and electromagnetic screen.\r\nWhen the coil is used for such experiments as are here contemplated,\r\nthe employment of the metal cover offers some practical advantages,\r\nbut these are not of sufficient importance to be dwelt upon.\r\n\r\nThe coil should be placed symmetrically to the metal cover, and the\r\nspace between should, of course, not be too small, certainly not less\r\nthan, say, five centimetres, but much more if possible; especially the\r\ntwo sides of the zinc box, which are at right angles to the axis of\r\nthe coil, should be sufficiently remote from the latter, as otherwise\r\nthey might impair its action and be a source of loss.\r\n\r\nThe coil consists of two spools of hard rubber RR, held apart at a\r\ndistance of 10 centimetres by bolts c and nuts n, likewise of hard\r\nrubber. Each spool comprises a tube T of approximately 8 centimetres\r\ninside diameter, and 3 millimetres thick, upon which are screwed two\r\nflanges FF, 24 centimetres square, the space between the flanges being\r\nabout 3 centimetres. The secondary, SS, of the best gutta\r\npercha-covered wire, has 26 layers, 10 turns in each, giving for each\r\nhalf a total of 260 turns. The two halves are wound oppositely and\r\nconnected in series, the connection between both being made over the\r\nprimary. This disposition, besides being convenient, has the advantage\r\nthat when the coil is well balanced--that is, when both of its\r\nterminals T_1 T_1 are connected to bodies or devices of equal\r\ncapacity--there is not much danger of breaking through to the primary,\r\nand the insulation between the primary and the secondary need not be\r\nthick. In using the coil it is advisable to attach to _both_ terminals\r\ndevices of nearly equal capacity, as, when the capacity of the\r\nterminals is not equal, sparks will be apt to pass to the primary. To\r\navoid this, the middle point of the secondary may be connected to the\r\nprimary, but this is not always practicable.\r\n\r\nThe primary PP is wound in two parts, and oppositely, upon a wooden\r\nspool W, and the four ends are led out of the oil through hard rubber\r\ntubes tt. The ends of the secondary T_1 T_1 are also led out of the\r\noil through rubber tubes t_1 t_1 of great thickness. The primary and\r\nsecondary layers are insulated by cotton cloth, the thickness of the\r\ninsulation, of course, bearing some proportion to the difference of\r\npotential between the turns of the different layers. Each half of the\r\nprimary has four layers, 24 turns in each, this giving a total of 96\r\nturns. When both the parts are connected in series, this gives a\r\nratio of conversion of about 1:2.7, and with the primaries in\r\nmultiple, 1:5.4; but in operating with very rapidly alternating\r\ncurrents this ratio does not convey even an approximate idea of the\r\nratio of the E.M.Fs. in the primary and secondary circuits. The coil\r\nis held in position in the oil on wooden supports, there being about 5\r\ncentimetres thickness of oil all round. Where the oil is not specially\r\nneeded, the space is filled with pieces of wood, and for this purpose\r\nprincipally the wooden box B surrounding the whole is used.\r\n\r\nThe construction here shown is, of course, not the best on general\r\nprinciples, but I believe it is a good and convenient one for the\r\nproduction of effects in which an excessive potential and a very small\r\ncurrent are needed.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the coil I use either the ordinary form of\r\ndischarger or a modified form. In the former I have introduced two\r\nchanges which secure some advantages, and which are obvious. If they\r\nare mentioned, it is only in the hope that some experimenter may find\r\nthem of use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--ARRANGEMENT OF IMPROVED DISCHARGER AND\r\nMAGNET.]\r\n\r\nOne of the changes is that the adjustable knobs A and B (Fig. 4),\r\nof the discharger are held in jaws of brass, JJ, by spring pressure,\r\nthis allowing of turning them successively into different positions,\r\nand so doing away with the tedious process of frequent polishing up.\r\n\r\nThe other change consists in the employment of a strong electromagnet\r\nNS, which is placed with its axis at right angles to the line joining\r\nthe knobs A and B, and produces a strong magnetic field between them.\r\nThe pole pieces of the magnet are movable and properly formed so as to\r\nprotrude between the brass knobs, in order to make the field as\r\nintense as possible; but to prevent the discharge from jumping to the\r\nmagnet the pole pieces are protected by a layer of mica, MM, of\r\nsufficient thickness. s_1 s_1 and s_2 s_2 are screws for fastening the\r\nwires. On each side one of the screws is for large and the other for\r\nsmall wires. LL are screws for fixing in position the rods RR, which\r\nsupport the knobs.\r\n\r\nIn another arrangement with the magnet I take the discharge between\r\nthe rounded pole pieces themselves, which in such case are insulated\r\nand preferably provided with polished brass caps.\r\n\r\nThe employment of an intense magnetic field is of advantage\r\nprincipally when the induction coil or transformer which charges the\r\ncondenser is operated by currents of very low frequency. In such a\r\ncase the number of the fundamental discharges between the knobs may be\r\nso small as to render the currents produced in the secondary\r\nunsuitable for many experiments. The intense magnetic field then\r\nserves to blow out the arc between the knobs as soon as it is formed,\r\nand the fundamental discharges occur in quicker succession.\r\n\r\nInstead of the magnet, a draught or blast of air may be employed with\r\nsome advantage. In this case the arc is preferably established between\r\nthe knobs AB, in Fig. 2 (the knobs ab being generally joined, or\r\nentirely done away with), as in this disposition the arc is long and\r\nunsteady, and is easily affected by the draught.\r\n\r\nWhen a magnet is employed to break the arc, it is better to choose\r\nthe connection indicated diagrammatically in Fig. 5, as in this case\r\nthe currents forming the arc are much more powerful, and the magnetic\r\nfield exercises a greater influence. The use of the magnet permits,\r\nhowever, of the arc being replaced by a vacuum tube, but I have\r\nencountered great difficulties in working with an exhausted tube.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--ARRANGEMENT WITH LOW-FREQUENCY ALTERNATOR AND\r\nIMPROVED DISCHARGER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--DISCHARGER WITH MULTIPLE GAPS.]\r\n\r\nThe other form of discharger used in these and similar experiments is\r\nindicated in Figs. 6 and 7. It consists of a number of brass pieces cc\r\n(Fig. 6), each of which comprises a spherical middle portion m with an\r\nextension e below--which is merely used to fasten the piece in a lathe\r\nwhen polishing up the discharging surface--and a column above, which\r\nconsists of a knurled flange f surmounted by a threaded stem l\r\ncarrying a nut n, by means of which a wire is fastened to the column.\r\nThe flange f conveniently serves for holding the brass piece when\r\nfastening the wire, and also for turning it in any position when it\r\nbecomes necessary to present a fresh discharging surface. Two stout\r\nstrips of hard rubber RR, with planed grooves gg (Fig. 7) to fit the\r\nmiddle portion of the pieces cc, serve to clamp the latter and hold\r\nthem firmly in position by means of two bolts CC (of which only one is\r\nshown) passing through the ends of the strips.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--DISCHARGER WITH MULTIPLE GAPS.]\r\n\r\nIn the use of this kind of discharger I have found three principal\r\nadvantages over the ordinary form. First, the dielectric strength of a\r\ngiven total width of air space is greater when a great many small air\r\ngaps are used instead of one, which permits of working with a smaller\r\nlength of air gap, and that means smaller loss and less deterioration\r\nof the metal; secondly by reason of splitting the arc up into smaller\r\narcs, the polished surfaces are made to last much longer; and,\r\nthirdly, the apparatus affords some gauge in the experiments. I\r\nusually set the pieces by putting between them sheets of uniform\r\nthickness at a certain very small distance which is known from the\r\nexperiments of Sir William Thomson to require a certain electromotive\r\nforce to be bridged by the spark.\r\n\r\nIt should, of course, be remembered that the sparking distance is much\r\ndiminished as the frequency is increased. By taking any number of\r\nspaces the experimenter has a rough idea of the electromotive force,\r\nand he finds it easier to repeat an experiment, as he has not the\r\ntrouble of setting the knobs again and again. With this kind of\r\ndischarger I have been able to maintain an oscillating motion without\r\nany spark being visible with the naked eye between the knobs, and they\r\nwould not show a very appreciable rise in temperature. This form of\r\ndischarge also lends itself to many arrangements of condensers and\r\ncircuits which are often very convenient and time-saving. I have used\r\nit preferably in a disposition similar to that indicated in Fig. 2,\r\nwhen the currents forming the arc are small.\r\n\r\nI may here mention that I have also used dischargers with single or\r\nmultiple air gaps, in which the discharge surfaces were rotated with\r\ngreat speed. No particular advantage was, however, gained by this\r\nmethod, except in cases where the currents from the condenser were\r\nlarge and the keeping cool of the surfaces was necessary, and in cases\r\nwhen, the discharge not being oscillating of itself, the arc as soon\r\nas established was broken by the air current, thus starting the\r\nvibration at intervals in rapid succession. I have also used\r\nmechanical interrupters in many ways. To avoid the difficulties with\r\nfrictional contacts, the preferred plan adopted was to establish the\r\narc and rotate through it at great speed a rim of mica provided with\r\nmany holes and fastened to a steel plate. It is understood, of course,\r\nthat the employment of a magnet, air current, or other interrupter,\r\nproduces no effect worth noticing, unless the self-induction, capacity\r\nand resistance are so related that there are oscillations set up upon\r\neach interruption.\r\n\r\nI will now endeavor to show you some of the most noteworthy of these\r\ndischarge phenomena.\r\n\r\nI have stretched across the room two ordinary cotton covered wires,\r\neach about 7 metres in length. They are supported on insulating cords\r\nat a distance of about 30 centimetres. I attach now to each of the\r\nterminals of the coil one of the wires and set the coil in action.\r\nUpon turning the lights off in the room you see the wires strongly\r\nilluminated by the streams issuing abundantly from their whole surface\r\nin spite of the cotton covering, which may even be very thick. When\r\nthe experiment is performed under good conditions, the light from the\r\nwires is sufficiently intense to allow distinguishing the objects in a\r\nroom. To produce the best result it is, of course, necessary to adjust\r\ncarefully the capacity of the jars, the arc between the knobs and the\r\nlength of the wires. My experience is that calculation of the length\r\nof the wires leads, in such case, to no result whatever. The\r\nexperimenter will do best to take the wires at the start very long,\r\nand then adjust by cutting off first long pieces, and then smaller and\r\nsmaller ones as he approaches the right length.\r\n\r\nA convenient way is to use an oil condenser of very small capacity,\r\nconsisting of two small adjustable metal plates, in connection with\r\nthis and similar experiments. In such case I take wires rather short\r\nand set at the beginning the condenser plates at maximum distance. If\r\nthe streams for the wires increase by approach of the plates, the\r\nlength of the wires is about right; if they diminish the wires are too\r\nlong for that frequency and potential. When a condenser is used in\r\nconnection with experiments with such a coil, it should be an oil\r\ncondenser by all means, as in using an air condenser considerable\r\nenergy might be wasted. The wires leading to the plates in the oil\r\nshould be very thin, heavily coated with some insulating compound, and\r\nprovided with a conducting covering--this preferably extending under\r\nthe surface of the oil. The conducting cover should not be too near\r\nthe terminals, or ends, of the wire, as a spark would be apt to jump\r\nfrom the wire to it. The conducting coating is used to diminish the\r\nair losses, in virtue of its action as an electrostatic screen. As to\r\nthe size of the vessel containing the oil, and the size of the plates,\r\nthe experimenter gains at once an idea from a rough trial. The size of\r\nthe plates _in oil_ is, however, calculable, as the dielectric losses\r\nare very small.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding experiment it is of considerable interest to know\r\nwhat relation the quantity of the light emitted bears to the frequency\r\nand potential of the electric impulses. My opinion is that the heat as\r\nwell as light effects produced should be proportionate, under\r\notherwise equal conditions of test, to the product of frequency and\r\nsquare of potential, but the experimental verification of the law,\r\nwhatever it may be, would be exceedingly difficult. One thing is\r\ncertain, at any rate, and that is, that in augmenting the potential\r\nand frequency we rapidly intensify the streams; and, though it may be\r\nvery sanguine, it is surely not altogether hopeless to expect that we\r\nmay succeed in producing a practical illuminant on these lines. We\r\nwould then be simply using burners or flames, in which there would be\r\nno chemical process, no consumption of material, but merely a transfer\r\nof energy, and which would, in all probability emit more light and\r\nless heat than ordinary flames.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--EFFECT PRODUCED BY CONCENTRATING STREAMS.]\r\n\r\nThe luminous intensity of the streams is, of course, considerably\r\nincreased when they are focused upon a small surface. This may be\r\nshown by the following experiment:\r\n\r\nI attach to one of the terminals of the coil a wire w (Fig. 8), bent\r\nin a circle of about 30 centimetres in diameter, and to the other\r\nterminal I fasten a small brass sphere s, the surface of the wire\r\nbeing preferably equal to the surface of the sphere, and the centre of\r\nthe latter being in a line at right angles to the plane of the wire\r\ncircle and passing through its centre. When the discharge is\r\nestablished under proper conditions, a luminous hollow cone is formed,\r\nand in the dark one-half of the brass sphere is strongly illuminated,\r\nas shown in the cut.\r\n\r\nBy some artifice or other, it is easy to concentrate the streams upon\r\nsmall surfaces and to produce very strong light effects. Two thin\r\nwires may thus be rendered intensely luminous.\r\n\r\nIn order to intensify the streams the wires should be very thin and\r\nshort; but as in this case their capacity would be generally too small\r\nfor the coil--at least, for such a one as the present--it is necessary\r\nto augment the capacity to the required value, while, at the same\r\ntime, the surface of the wires remains very small. This may be done in\r\nmany ways.\r\n\r\nHere, for instance, I have two plates, RR, of hard rubber (Fig. 9),\r\nupon which I have glued two very thin wires ww, so as to form a name.\r\nThe wires may be bare or covered with the best insulation--it is\r\nimmaterial for the success of the experiment. Well insulated wires, if\r\nanything, are preferable. On the back of each plate, indicated by the\r\nshaded portion, is a tinfoil coating tt. The plates are placed in line\r\nat a sufficient distance to prevent a spark passing from one to the\r\nother wire. The two tinfoil coatings I have joined by a conductor C,\r\nand the two wires I presently connect to the terminals of the coil. It\r\nis now easy, by varying the strength and frequency of the currents\r\nthrough the primary, to find a point at which, the capacity of the\r\nsystem is best suited to the conditions, and the wires become so\r\nstrongly luminous that, when the light in the room is turned off the\r\nname formed by them appears in brilliant letters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--WIRES RENDERED INTENSELY LUMINOUS.]\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps preferable to perform this experiment with a coil\r\noperated from an alternator of high frequency, as then, owing to the\r\nharmonic rise and fall, the streams are very uniform, though they are\r\nless abundant then when produced with such a coil as the present. This\r\nexperiment, however, may be performed with low frequencies, but much\r\nless satisfactorily.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.--LUMINOUS DISCS.]\r\n\r\nWhen two wires, attached to the terminals of the coil, are set at the\r\nproper distance, the streams between them may be so intense as to\r\nproduce a continuous luminous sheet. To show this phenomenon I have\r\nhere two circles, C and c (Fig. 10), of rather stout wire, one being\r\nabout 80 centimetres and the other 30 centimetres in diameter. To each\r\nof the terminals of the coil I attach one of the circles. The\r\nsupporting wires are so bent that the circles may be placed in the\r\nsame plane, coinciding as nearly as possible. When the light in the\r\nroom is turned off and the coil set to work, you see the whole space\r\nbetween the wires uniformly filled with streams, forming a luminous\r\ndisc, which could be seen from a considerable distance, such is the\r\nintensity of the streams. The outer circle could have been much larger\r\nthan the present one; in fact, with this coil I have used much larger\r\ncircles, and I have been able to produce a strongly luminous sheet,\r\ncovering an area of more than one square metre, which is a remarkable\r\neffect with this very small coil. To avoid uncertainty, the circle has\r\nbeen taken smaller, and the area is now about 0.43 square metre.\r\n\r\nThe frequency of the vibration, and the quickness of succession of the\r\nsparks between the knobs, affect to a marked degree the appearance of\r\nthe streams. When the frequency is very low, the air gives way in more\r\nor less the same manner, as by a steady difference of potential, and\r\nthe streams consist of distinct threads, generally mingled with thin\r\nsparks, which probably correspond to the successive discharges\r\noccurring between the knobs. But when the frequency is extremely high,\r\nand the arc of the discharge produces a very _loud_ but _smooth_\r\nsound--showing both that oscillation takes place and that the sparks\r\nsucceed each other with great rapidity--then the luminous streams\r\nformed are perfectly uniform. To reach this result very small coils\r\nand jars of small capacity should be used. I take two tubes of thick\r\nBohemian glass, about 5 centimetres in diameter and 20 centimetres\r\nlong. In each of the tubes I slip a primary of very thick copper wire.\r\nOn the top of each tube I wind a secondary of much thinner\r\ngutta-percha covered wire. The two secondaries I connect in series,\r\nthe primaries preferably in multiple arc. The tubes are then placed in\r\na large glass vessel, at a distance of 10 to 15 centimetres from each\r\nother, on insulating supports, and the vessel is filled with boiled\r\nout oil, the oil reaching about an inch above the tubes. The free ends\r\nof the secondary are lifted out of the oil and placed parallel to each\r\nother at a distance of about 10 centimetres. The ends which are\r\nscraped should be dipped in the oil. Two four-pint jars joined in\r\nseries may be used to discharge through the primary. When the\r\nnecessary adjustments in the length and distance of the wires above\r\nthe oil and in the arc of discharge are made, a luminous sheet is\r\nproduced between the wires which is perfectly smooth and textureless,\r\nlike the ordinary discharge through a moderately exhausted tube.\r\n\r\nI have purposely dwelt upon this apparently insignificant experiment.\r\nIn trials of this kind the experimenter arrives at the startling\r\nconclusion that, to pass ordinary luminous discharges through gases,\r\nno particular degree of exhaustion is needed, but that the gas may be\r\nat ordinary or even greater pressure. To accomplish this, a very high\r\nfrequency is essential; a high potential is likewise required, but\r\nthis is a merely incidental necessity. These experiments teach us\r\nthat, in endeavoring to discover novel methods of producing light by\r\nthe agitation of atoms, or molecules, of a gas, we need not limit our\r\nresearch to the vacuum tube, but may look forward quite seriously to\r\nthe possibility of obtaining the light effects without the use of any\r\nvessel whatever, with air at ordinary pressure.\r\n\r\nSuch discharges of very high frequency, which render luminous the air\r\nat ordinary pressures, we have probably often occasion to witness in\r\nNature. I have no doubt that if, as many believe, the aurora borealis\r\nis produced by sudden cosmic disturbances, such as eruptions at the\r\nsun's surface, which set the electrostatic charge of the earth in an\r\nextremely rapid vibration, the red glow observed is not confined to\r\nthe upper rarefied strata of the air, but the discharge traverses, by\r\nreason of its very high frequency, also the dense atmosphere in the\r\nform of a _glow_, such as we ordinarily produce in a slightly\r\nexhausted tube. If the frequency were very low, or even more so, if\r\nthe charge were not at all vibrating, the dense air would break down\r\nas in a lightning discharge. Indications of such breaking down of the\r\nlower dense strata of the air have been repeatedly observed at the\r\noccurrence of this marvelous phenomenon; but if it does occur, it can\r\nonly be attributed to the fundamental disturbances, which are few in\r\nnumber, for the vibration produced by them would be far too rapid to\r\nallow a disruptive break. It is the original and irregular impulses\r\nwhich affect the instruments; the superimposed vibrations probably\r\npass unnoticed.\r\n\r\nWhen an ordinary low frequency discharge is passed through moderately\r\nrarefied air, the air assumes a purplish hue. If by some means or\r\nother we increase the intensity of the molecular, or atomic,\r\nvibration, the gas changes to a white color. A similar change occurs\r\nat ordinary pressures with electric impulses of very high frequency.\r\nIf the molecules of the air around a wire are moderately agitated, the\r\nbrush formed is reddish or violet; if the vibration is rendered\r\nsufficiently intense, the streams become white. We may accomplish this\r\nin various ways. In the experiment before shown with the two wires\r\nacross the room, I have endeavored to secure the result by pushing to\r\na high value both the frequency and potential: in the experiment with\r\nthe thin wires glued on the rubber plate I have concentrated the\r\naction upon a very small surface--in other words, I have worked with a\r\ngreat electric density.\r\n\r\nA most curious form of discharge is observed with such a coil when the\r\nfrequency and potential are pushed to the extreme limit. To perform\r\nthe experiment, every part of the coil should be heavily insulated,\r\nand only two small spheres--or, better still, two sharp-edged metal\r\ndiscs (dd, Fig. 11) of no more than a few centimetres in\r\ndiameter--should be exposed to the air. The coil here used is immersed\r\nin oil, and the ends of the secondary reaching out of the oil are\r\ncovered with an air-tight cover of hard rubber of great thickness.\r\nAll cracks, if there are any, should be carefully stopped up, so that\r\nthe brush discharge cannot form anywhere except on the small spheres\r\nor plates which are exposed to the air. In this case, since there are\r\nno large plates or other bodies of capacity attached to the terminals,\r\nthe coil is capable of an extremely rapid vibration. The potential may\r\nbe raised by increasing, as far as the experimenter judges proper, the\r\nrate of change of the primary current. With a coil not widely\r\ndiffering from the present, it is best to connect the two primaries in\r\nmultiple arc; but if the secondary should have a much greater number\r\nof turns the primaries should preferably be used in series, as\r\notherwise the vibration might be too fast for the secondary. It occurs\r\nunder these conditions that misty white streams break forth from the\r\nedges of the discs and spread out phantom-like into space. With this\r\ncoil, when fairly well produced, they are about 25 to 30 centimetres\r\nlong. When the hand is held against them no sensation is produced, and\r\na spark, causing a shock, jumps from the terminal only upon the hand\r\nbeing brought much nearer. If the oscillation of the primary current\r\nis rendered intermittent by some means or other, there is a\r\ncorresponding throbbing of the streams, and now the hand or other\r\nconducting object may be brought in still greater proximity to the\r\nterminal without a spark being caused to jump.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--PHANTOM STREAMS.]\r\n\r\nAmong the many beautiful phenomena which may be produced with such a\r\ncoil I have here selected only those which appear to possess some\r\nfeatures of novelty, and lead us to some conclusions of interest. One\r\nwill not find it at all difficult to produce in the laboratory, by\r\nmeans of it, many other phenomena which appeal to the eye even more\r\nthan these here shown, but present no particular feature of novelty.\r\n\r\nEarly experimenters describe the display of sparks produced by an\r\nordinary large induction coil upon an insulating plate separating the\r\nterminals. Quite recently Siemens performed some experiments in which\r\nfine effects were obtained, which were seen by many with interest. No\r\ndoubt large coils, even if operated with currents of low frequencies,\r\nare capable of producing beautiful effects. But the largest coil ever\r\nmade could not, by far, equal the magnificent display of streams and\r\nsparks obtained from such a disruptive discharge coil when properly\r\nadjusted. To give an idea, a coil such as the present one will cover\r\neasily a plate of 1 metre in diameter completely with the streams. The\r\nbest way to perform such experiments is to take a very thin rubber or\r\na glass plate and glue on one side of it a narrow ring of tinfoil of\r\nvery large diameter, and on the other a circular washer, the centre of\r\nthe latter coinciding with that of the ring, and the surfaces of both\r\nbeing preferably equal, so as to keep the coil well balanced. The\r\nwasher and ring should be connected to the terminals by heavily\r\ninsulated thin wires. It is easy in observing the effect of the\r\ncapacity to produce a sheet of uniform streams, or a fine network of\r\nthin silvery threads, or a mass of loud brilliant sparks, which\r\ncompletely cover the plate.\r\n\r\nSince I have advanced the idea of the conversion by means of the\r\ndisruptive discharge, in my paper before the American Institute of\r\nElectrical Engineers at the beginning of the past year, the interest\r\nexcited in it has been considerable. It affords us a means for\r\nproducing any potentials by the aid of inexpensive coils operated from\r\nordinary systems of distribution, and--what is perhaps more\r\nappreciated--it enables us to convert currents of any frequency into\r\ncurrents of any other lower or higher frequency. But its chief value\r\nwill perhaps be found in the help which it will afford us in the\r\ninvestigations of the phenomena of phosphorescence, which a disruptive\r\ndischarge coil is capable of exciting in innumerable cases where\r\nordinary coils, even the largest, would utterly fail.\r\n\r\nConsidering its probable uses for many practical purposes, and its\r\npossible introduction into laboratories for scientific research, a few\r\nadditional remarks as to the construction of such a coil will perhaps\r\nnot be found superfluous.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, absolutely necessary to employ in such a coil wires\r\nprovided with the best insulation.\r\n\r\nGood coils may be produced by employing wires covered with several\r\nlayers of cotton, boiling the coil a long time in pure wax, and\r\ncooling under moderate pressure. The advantage of such a coil is that\r\nit can be easily handled, but it cannot probably give as satisfactory\r\nresults as a coil immersed in pure oil. Besides, it seems that the\r\npresence of a large body of wax affects the coil disadvantageously,\r\nwhereas this does not seem to be the case with oil. Perhaps it is\r\nbecause the dielectric losses in the liquid are smaller.\r\n\r\nI have tried at first silk and cotton covered wires with oil\r\nimmersion, but I have been gradually led to use gutta-percha covered\r\nwires, which proved most satisfactory. Gutta-percha insulation adds,\r\nof course, to the capacity of the coil, and this, especially if the\r\ncoil be large, is a great disadvantage when extreme frequencies are\r\ndesired; but on the other hand, gutta-percha will withstand much more\r\nthan an equal thickness of oil, and this advantage should be secured\r\nat any price. Once the coil has been immersed, it should never be\r\ntaken out of the oil for more than a few hours, else the gutta-percha\r\nwill crack up and the coil will not be worth half as much as before.\r\nGutta-percha is probably slowly attacked by the oil, but after an\r\nimmersion of eight to nine months I have found no ill effects.\r\n\r\nI have obtained in commerce two kinds of gutta-percha wire: in one the\r\ninsulation sticks tightly to the metal, in the other it does not.\r\nUnless a special method is followed to expel all air, it is much safer\r\nto use the first kind. I wind the coil within an oil tank so that all\r\ninterstices are filled up with the oil. Between the layers I use cloth\r\nboiled out thoroughly in oil, calculating the thickness according to\r\nthe difference of potential between the turns. There seems not to be a\r\nvery great difference whatever kind of oil is used; I use paraffine or\r\nlinseed oil.\r\n\r\nTo exclude more perfectly the air, an excellent way to proceed, and\r\neasily practicable with small coils, is the following: Construct a box\r\nof hard wood of very thick boards which have been for a long time\r\nboiled in oil. The boards should be so joined as to safely withstand\r\nthe external air pressure. The coil being placed and fastened in\r\nposition within the box, the latter is closed with a strong lid, and\r\ncovered with closely fitting metal sheets, the joints of which are\r\nsoldered very carefully. On the top two small holes are drilled,\r\npassing through the metal sheet and the wood, and in these holes two\r\nsmall glass tubes are inserted and the joints made air-tight. One of\r\nthe tubes is connected to a vacuum pump, and the other with a vessel\r\ncontaining a sufficient quantity of boiled-out oil. The latter tube\r\nhas a very small hole at the bottom, and is provided with a stopcock.\r\nWhen a fairly good vacuum has been obtained, the stopcock is opened\r\nand the oil slowly fed in. Proceeding in this manner, it is impossible\r\nthat any big bubbles, which are the principal danger, should remain\r\nbetween the turns. The air is most completely excluded, probably\r\nbetter than by boiling out, which, however, when gutta-percha coated\r\nwires are used, is not practicable.\r\n\r\nFor the primaries I use ordinary line wire with a thick cotton\r\ncoating. Strands of very thin insulated wires properly interlaced\r\nwould, of course, be the best to employ for the primaries, but they\r\nare not to be had.\r\n\r\nIn an experimental coil the size of the wires is not of great\r\nimportance. In the coil here used the primary is No. 12 and the\r\nsecondary No. 24 Brown & Sharpe gauge wire; but the sections may be\r\nvaried considerably. It would only imply different adjustments; the\r\nresults aimed at would not be materially affected.\r\n\r\nI have dwelt at some length upon the various forms of brush discharge\r\nbecause, in studying them, we not only observe phenomena which please\r\nour eye, but also afford us food for thought, and lead us to\r\nconclusions of practical importance. In the use of alternating\r\ncurrents of very high tension, too much precaution cannot be taken to\r\nprevent the brush discharge. In a main conveying such currents, in an\r\ninduction coil or transformer, or in a condenser, the brush discharge\r\nis a source of great danger to the insulation. In a condenser\r\nespecially the gaseous matter must be most carefully expelled, for in\r\nit the charged surfaces are near each other, and if the potentials are\r\nhigh, just as sure as a weight will fall if let go, so the insulation\r\nwill give way if a single gaseous bubble of some size be present,\r\nwhereas, if all gaseous matter were carefully excluded, the condenser\r\nwould safely withstand a much higher difference of potential. A main\r\nconveying alternating currents of very high tension may be injured\r\nmerely by a blow hole or small crack in the insulation, the more so as\r\na blowhole is apt to contain gas at low pressure; and as it appears\r\nalmost impossible to completely obviate such little imperfections, I\r\nam led to believe that in our future distribution of electrical energy\r\nby currents of very high tension liquid insulation will be used. The\r\ncost is a great drawback, but if we employ an oil as an insulator the\r\ndistribution of electrical energy with something like 100,000 volts,\r\nand even more, become, at least with higher frequencies, so easy that\r\nthey could be hardly called engineering feats. With oil insulation\r\nand alternate current motors transmissions of power can be effected\r\nwith safety and upon an industrial basis at distances of as much as a\r\nthousand miles.\r\n\r\nA peculiar property of oils, and liquid insulation in general, when\r\nsubjected to rapidly changing electric stresses, is to disperse any\r\ngaseous bubbles which may be present, and diffuse them through its\r\nmass, generally long before any injurious break can occur. This\r\nfeature may be easily observed with an ordinary induction coil by\r\ntaking the primary out, plugging up the end of the tube upon which the\r\nsecondary is wound, and filling it with some fairly transparent\r\ninsulator, such as paraffine oil. A primary of a diameter something\r\nlike six millimetres smaller than the inside of the tube may be\r\ninserted in the oil. When the coil is set to work one may see, looking\r\nfrom the top through the oil, many luminous points--air bubbles which\r\nare caught by inserting the primary, and which are rendered luminous\r\nin consequence of the violent bombardment. The occluded air, by its\r\nimpact against the oil, heats it; the oil begins to circulate,\r\ncarrying some of the air along with it, until the bubbles are\r\ndispersed and the luminous points disappear. In this manner, unless\r\nlarge bubbles are occluded in such way that circulation is rendered\r\nimpossible, a damaging break is averted, the only effect being a\r\nmoderate warming up of the oil. If, instead of the liquid, a solid\r\ninsulation, no matter how thick, were used, a breaking through and\r\ninjury of the apparatus would be inevitable.\r\n\r\nThe exclusion of gaseous matter from any apparatus in which the\r\ndielectric is subjected to more or less rapidly changing electric\r\nforces is, however, not only desirable in order to avoid a possible\r\ninjury of the apparatus, but also on account of economy. In a\r\ncondenser, for instance, as long as only a solid or only a liquid\r\ndielectric is used, the loss is small; but if a gas under ordinary or\r\nsmall pressure be present the loss may be very great. Whatever the\r\nnature of the force acting in the dielectric may be, it seems that in\r\na solid or liquid the molecular displacement produced by the force is\r\nsmall; hence the product of force and displacement is insignificant,\r\nunless the force be very great; but in a gas the displacement, and\r\ntherefore this product, is considerable; the molecules are free to\r\nmove, they reach high speeds, and the energy of their impact is lost\r\nin heat or otherwise. If the gas be strongly compressed, the\r\ndisplacement due to the force is made smaller, and the losses are\r\nreduced.\r\n\r\nIn most of the succeeding experiments I prefer, chiefly on account of\r\nthe regular and positive action, to employ the alternator before\r\nreferred to. This is one of the several machines constructed by me for\r\nthe purposes of these investigations. It has 384 pole projections, and\r\nis capable of giving currents of a frequency of about 10,000 per\r\nsecond. This machine has been illustrated and briefly described in my\r\nfirst paper before the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, May\r\n20, 1891, to which I have already referred. A more detailed\r\ndescription, sufficient to enable any engineer to build a similar\r\nmachine, will be found in several electrical journals of that period.\r\n\r\nThe induction coils operated from the machine are rather small,\r\ncontaining from 5,000 to 15,000 turns in the secondary. They are\r\nimmersed in boiled-out linseed oil, contained in wooden boxes covered\r\nwith zinc sheet.\r\n\r\nI have found it advantageous to reverse the usual position of the\r\nwires, and to wind, in these coils, the primaries on the top; this\r\nallowing the use of a much bigger primary, which, of course, reduces\r\nthe danger of overheating and increases the output of the coil. I make\r\nthe primary on each side at least one centimetre shorter than the\r\nsecondary, to prevent the breaking through on the ends, which would\r\nsurely occur unless the insulation on the top of the secondary be very\r\nthick, and this, of course, would be disadvantageous.\r\n\r\nWhen the primary is made movable, which is necessary in some\r\nexperiments, and many times convenient for the purposes of adjustment,\r\nI cover the secondary with wax, and turn it off in a lathe to a\r\ndiameter slightly smaller than the inside of the primary coil. The\r\nlatter I provide with a handle reaching out of the oil, which serves\r\nto shift it in any position along the secondary.\r\n\r\nI will now venture to make, in regard to the general manipulation of\r\ninduction coils, a few observations bearing upon points which have not\r\nbeen fully appreciated in earlier experiments with such coils, and are\r\neven now often overlooked.\r\n\r\nThe secondary of the coil possesses usually such a high self-induction\r\nthat the current through the wire is inappreciable, and may be so even\r\nwhen the terminals are joined by a conductor of small resistance. If\r\ncapacity is added to the terminals, the self-induction is\r\ncounteracted, and a stronger current is made to flow through the\r\nsecondary, though its terminals are insulated from each other. To one\r\nentirely unacquainted with the properties of alternating currents\r\nnothing will look more puzzling. This feature was illustrated in the\r\nexperiment performed at the beginning with the top plates of wire\r\ngauze attached to the terminals and the rubber plate. When the plates\r\nof wire gauze were close together, and a small arc passed between\r\nthem, the arc _prevented_ a strong current from passing through the\r\nsecondary, because it did away with the capacity on the terminals;\r\nwhen the rubber plate was inserted between, the capacity of the\r\ncondenser formed counteracted the self-induction of the secondary, a\r\nstronger current passed now, the coil performed more work, and the\r\ndischarge was by far more powerful.\r\n\r\nThe first thing, then, in operating the induction coil is to combine\r\ncapacity with the secondary to overcome the self-induction. If the\r\nfrequencies and potentials are very high gaseous matter should be\r\ncarefully kept away from the charged surfaces. If Leyden jars are\r\nused, they should be immersed in oil, as otherwise considerable\r\ndissipation may occur if the jars are greatly strained. When high\r\nfrequencies are used, it is of equal importance to combine a condenser\r\nwith the primary. One may use a condenser connected to the ends of the\r\nprimary or to the terminals of the alternator, but the latter is not\r\nto be recommended, as the machine might be injured. The best way is\r\nundoubtedly to use the condenser in series with the primary and with\r\nthe alternator, and to adjust its capacity so as to annul the\r\nself-induction of both the latter. The condenser should be adjustable\r\nby very small steps, and for a finer adjustment a small oil condenser\r\nwith movable plates may be used conveniently.\r\n\r\nI think it best at this juncture to bring before you a phenomenon,\r\nobserved by me some time ago, which to the purely scientific\r\ninvestigator may perhaps appear more interesting than any of the\r\nresults which I have the privilege to present to you this evening.\r\n\r\nIt may be quite properly ranked among the brush phenomena--in fact, it\r\nis a brush, formed at, or near, a single terminal in high vacuum.\r\n\r\nIn bulbs provided with a conducting terminal, though it be of\r\naluminium, the brush has but an ephemeral existence, and cannot,\r\nunfortunately, be indefinitely preserved in its most sensitive state,\r\neven in a bulb devoid of any conducting electrode. In studying the\r\nphenomenon, by all means a bulb having no leading-in wire should be\r\nused. I have found it best to use bulbs constructed as indicated in\r\nFigs. 12 and 13.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 12 the bulb comprises an incandescent lamp globe L, in the\r\nneck of which is sealed a barometer tube b, the end of which is blown\r\nout to form a small sphere s. This sphere should be sealed as closely\r\nas possible in the centre of the large globe. Before sealing, a thin\r\ntube t, of aluminium sheet, may be slipped in the barometer tube, but\r\nit is not important to employ it.\r\n\r\nThe small hollow sphere s is filled with some conducting powder, and a\r\nwire w is cemented in the neck for the purpose of connecting the\r\nconducting powder with the generator.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12. FIG. 13. BULBS FOR PRODUCING ROTATING BRUSH.]\r\n\r\nThe construction shown in Fig. 13 was chosen in order to remove from\r\nthe brush any conducting body which might possibly affect it. The bulb\r\nconsists in this case of a lamp globe L, which has a neck n, provided\r\nwith a tube b and small sphere s, sealed to it, so that two entirely\r\nindependent compartments are formed, as indicated in the drawing. When\r\nthe bulb is in use, the neck n is provided with a tinfoil coating,\r\nwhich is connected to the generator and acts inductively upon the\r\nmoderately rarefied and highly conducting gas inclosed in the neck.\r\nFrom there the current passes through the tube b into the small sphere\r\ns to act by induction upon the gas contained in the globe L.\r\n\r\nIt is of advantage to make the tube t very thick, the hole through it\r\nvery small, and to blow the sphere s very thin. It is of the greatest\r\nimportance that the sphere s be placed in the centre of the globe L.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.--FORMS AND PHASES OF THE ROTATING BRUSH.]\r\n\r\nFigs. 14, 15 and 16 indicate different forms, or stages, of the brush.\r\nFig. 14 shows the brush as it first appears in a bulb provided with a\r\nconducting terminal; but, as in such a bulb it very soon\r\ndisappears--often after a few minutes--I will confine myself to the\r\ndescription of the phenomenon as seen in a bulb without conducting\r\nelectrode. It is observed under the following conditions:\r\n\r\nWhen the globe L (Figs. 12 and 13) is exhausted to a very high\r\ndegree, generally the bulb is not excited upon connecting the wire w\r\n(Fig. 12) or the tinfoil coating of the bulb (Fig. 13) to the terminal\r\nof the induction coil. To excite it, it is usually sufficient to grasp\r\nthe globe L with the hand. An intense phosphorescence then spreads at\r\nfirst over the globe, but soon gives place to a white, misty light.\r\nShortly afterward one may notice that the luminosity is unevenly\r\ndistributed in the globe, and after passing the current for some time\r\nthe bulb appears as in Fig. 15. From this stage the phenomenon will\r\ngradually pass to that indicated in Fig. 16, after some minutes,\r\nhours, days or weeks, according as the bulb is worked. Warming the\r\nbulb or increasing the potential hastens the transit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15. FIG. 16. FORMS AND PHASES OF THE ROTATING\r\nBRUSH.]\r\n\r\nWhen the brush assumes the form indicated in Fig. 16, it maybe brought\r\nto a state of extreme sensitiveness to electrostatic and magnetic\r\ninfluence. The bulb hanging straight down from a wire, and all objects\r\nbeing remote from it, the approach of the observer at a few paces from\r\nthe bulb will cause the brush to fly to the opposite side, and if he\r\nwalks around the bulb it will always keep on the opposite side. It may\r\nbegin to spin around the terminal long before it reaches that\r\nsensitive stage. When it begins to turn around principally, but also\r\nbefore, it is affected by a magnet, and at a certain stage it is\r\nsusceptible to magnetic influence to an astonishing degree. A small\r\npermanent magnet, with its poles at a distance of no more than two\r\ncentimetres, will affect it visibly at a distance of two metres,\r\nslowing down or accelerating the rotation according to how it is held\r\nrelatively to the brush. I think I have observed that at the stage\r\nwhen it is most sensitive to magnetic, it is not most sensitive to\r\nelectrostatic, influence. My explanation is, that the electrostatic\r\nattraction between the brush and the glass of the bulb, which retards\r\nthe rotation, grows much quicker than the magnetic influence when the\r\nintensity of the stream is increased.\r\n\r\nWhen the bulb hangs with the globe L down, the rotation is always\r\nclockwise. In the southern hemisphere it would occur in the opposite\r\ndirection and on the equator the brush should not turn at all. The\r\nrotation may be reversed by a magnet kept at some distance. The brush\r\nrotates best, seemingly, when it is at right angles to the lines of\r\nforce of the earth. It very likely rotates, when at its maximum speed,\r\nin synchronism with the alternations, say 10,000 times a second. The\r\nrotation can be slowed down or accelerated by the approach or receding\r\nof the observer, or any conducting body, but it cannot be reversed by\r\nputting the bulb in any position. When it is in the state of the\r\nhighest sensitiveness and the potential or frequency be varied the\r\nsensitiveness is rapidly diminished. Changing either of these but\r\nlittle will generally stop the rotation. The sensitiveness is likewise\r\naffected by the variations of temperature. To attain great\r\nsensitiveness it is necessary to have the small sphere s in the centre\r\nof the globe L, as otherwise the electrostatic action of the glass of\r\nthe globe will tend to stop the rotation. The sphere s should be small\r\nand of uniform thickness; any dissymmetry of course has the effect to\r\ndiminish the sensitiveness.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the brush rotates in a definite direction in a permanent\r\nmagnetic field seems to show that in alternating currents of very high\r\nfrequency the positive and negative impulses are not equal, but that\r\none always preponderates over the other.\r\n\r\nOf course, this rotation in one direction may be due to the action of\r\ntwo elements of the same current upon each other, or to the action of\r\nthe field produced by one of the elements upon the other, as in a\r\nseries motor, without necessarily one impulse being stronger than the\r\nother. The fact that the brush turns, as far as I could observe, in\r\nany position, would speak for this view. In such case it would turn\r\nat any point of the earth's surface. But, on the other hand, it is\r\nthen hard to explain why a permanent magnet should reverse the\r\nrotation, and one must assume the preponderance of impulses of one\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nAs to the causes of the formation of the brush or stream, I think it\r\nis due to the electrostatic action of the globe and the dissymmetry of\r\nthe parts. If the small bulb s and the globe L were perfect concentric\r\nspheres, and the glass throughout of the same thickness and quality, I\r\nthink the brush would not form, as the tendency to pass would be equal\r\non all sides. That the formation of the stream is due to an\r\nirregularity is apparent from the fact that it has the tendency to\r\nremain in one position, and rotation occurs most generally only when\r\nit is brought out of this position by electrostatic or magnetic\r\ninfluence. When in an extremely sensitive state it rests in one\r\nposition, most curious experiments may be performed with it. For\r\ninstance, the experimenter may, by selecting a proper position,\r\napproach the hand at a certain considerable distance to the bulb, and\r\nhe may cause the brush to pass off by merely stiffening the muscles of\r\nthe arm. When it begins to rotate slowly, and the hands are held at a\r\nproper distance, it is impossible to make even the slightest motion\r\nwithout producing a visible effect upon the brush. A metal plate\r\nconnected to the other terminal of the coil affects it at a great\r\ndistance, slowing down the rotation often to one turn a second.\r\n\r\nI am firmly convinced that such a brush, when we learn how to produce\r\nit properly, will prove a valuable aid in the investigation of the\r\nnature of the forces acting in an electrostatic or magnetic field. If\r\nthere is any motion which is measurable going on in the space, such a\r\nbrush ought to reveal it. It is, so to speak, a beam of light,\r\nfrictionless, devoid of inertia.\r\n\r\nI think that it may find practical applications in telegraphy. With\r\nsuch a brush it would be possible to send dispatches across the\r\nAtlantic, for instance, with any speed, since its sensitiveness may be\r\nso great that the slightest changes will affect it. If it were\r\npossible to make the stream more intense and very narrow, its\r\ndeflections could be easily photographed.\r\n\r\nI have been interested to find whether there is a rotation of the\r\nstream itself, or whether there is simply a stress traveling around in\r\nthe bulb. For this purpose I mounted a light mica fan so that its\r\nvanes were in the path of the brush. If the stream itself was rotating\r\nthe fan would be spun around. I could produce no distinct rotation of\r\nthe fan, although I tried the experiment repeatedly; but as the fan\r\nexerted a noticeable influence on the stream, and the apparent\r\nrotation of the latter was, in this case, never quite satisfactory,\r\nthe experiment did not appear to be conclusive.\r\n\r\nI have been unable to produce the phenomenon with the disruptive\r\ndischarge coil, although every other of these phenomena can be well\r\nproduced by it--many, in fact, much better than with coils operated\r\nfrom an alternator.\r\n\r\nIt may be possible to produce the brush by impulses of one direction,\r\nor even by a steady potential, in which case it would be still more\r\nsensitive to magnetic influence.\r\n\r\nIn operating an induction coil with rapidly alternating currents, we\r\nrealize with astonishment, for the first time, the great importance\r\nof the relation of capacity, self-induction and frequency as regards\r\nthe general result. The effects of capacity are the most striking, for\r\nin these experiments, since the self-induction and frequency both are\r\nhigh, the critical capacity is very small, and need be but slightly\r\nvaried to produce a very considerable change. The experimenter may\r\nbring his body in contact with the terminals of the secondary of the\r\ncoil, or attach to one or both terminals insulated bodies of very\r\nsmall bulk, such as bulbs, and he may produce a considerable rise or\r\nfall of potential, and greatly affect the flow of the current through\r\nthe primary. In the experiment before shown, in which a brush appears\r\nat a wire attached to one terminal, and the wire is vibrated when the\r\nexperimenter brings his insulated body in contact with the other\r\nterminal of the coil, the sudden rise of potential was made evident.\r\n\r\nI may show you the behavior of the coil in another manner which\r\npossesses a feature of some interest. I have here a little light fan\r\nof aluminium sheet, fastened to a needle and arranged to rotate freely\r\nin a metal piece screwed to one of the terminals of the coil. When the\r\ncoil is set to work, the molecules of the air are rhythmically\r\nattracted and repelled. As the force with which they are repelled is\r\ngreater than that with which they are attracted, it results that there\r\nis a repulsion exerted on the surfaces of the fan. If the fan were\r\nmade simply of a metal sheet, the repulsion would be equal on the\r\nopposite sides, and would produce no effect. But if one of the\r\nopposing surfaces is screened, or if, generally speaking, the\r\nbombardment on this side is weakened in some way or other, there\r\nremains the repulsion exerted upon the other, and the fan is set in\r\nrotation. The screening is best effected by fastening upon one of the\r\nopposing sides of the fan insulated conducting coatings, or, if the\r\nfan is made in the shape of an ordinary propeller screw, by fastening\r\non one side, and close to it, an insulated metal plate. The static\r\nscreen may, however, be omitted, and simply a thickness of insulating\r\nmaterial fastened to one of the sides of the fan.\r\n\r\nTo show the behavior of the coil, the fan may be placed upon the\r\nterminal and it will readily rotate when the coil is operated by\r\ncurrents of very high frequency. With a steady potential, of course,\r\nand even with alternating currents of very low frequency, it would not\r\nturn, because of the very slow exchange of air and, consequently,\r\nsmaller bombardment; but in the latter case it might turn if the\r\npotential were excessive. With a pin wheel, quite the opposite rule\r\nholds good; it rotates best with a steady potential, and the effort is\r\nthe smaller the higher the frequency. Now, it is very easy to adjust\r\nthe conditions so that the potential is normally not sufficient to\r\nturn the fan, but that by connecting the other terminal of the coil\r\nwith an insulated body it rises to a much greater value, so as to\r\nrotate the fan, and it is likewise possible to stop the rotation by\r\nconnecting to the terminal a body of different size, thereby\r\ndiminishing the potential.\r\n\r\nInstead of using the fan in this experiment, we may use the \"electric\"\r\nradiometer with similar effect. But in this case it will be found that\r\nthe vanes will rotate only at high exhaustion or at ordinary\r\npressures; they will not rotate at moderate pressures, when the air is\r\nhighly conducting. This curious observation was made conjointly by\r\nProfessor Crookes and myself. I attribute the result to the high\r\nconductivity of the air, the molecules of which then do not act as\r\nindependent carriers of electric charges, but act all together as a\r\nsingle conducting body. In such case, of course, if there is any\r\nrepulsion at all of the molecules from the vanes, it must be very\r\nsmall. It is possible, however, that the result is in part due to the\r\nfact that the greater part of the discharge passes from the leading-in\r\nwire through the highly conducting gas, instead of passing off from\r\nthe conducting vanes.\r\n\r\nIn trying the preceding experiment with the electric radiometer the\r\npotential should not exceed a certain limit, as then the electrostatic\r\nattraction between the vanes and the glass of the bulb may be so great\r\nas to stop the rotation.\r\n\r\nA most curious feature of alternate currents of high frequencies and\r\npotentials is that they enable us to perform many experiments by the\r\nuse of one wire only. In many respects this feature is of great\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nIn a type of alternate current motor invented by me some years ago I\r\nproduced rotation by inducing, by means of a single alternating\r\ncurrent passed through a motor circuit, in the mass or other circuits\r\nof the motor, secondary currents, which, jointly with the primary or\r\ninducing current, created a moving field of force. A simple but crude\r\nform of such a motor is obtained by winding upon an iron core a\r\nprimary, and close to it a secondary coil, joining the ends of the\r\nlatter and placing a freely movable metal disc within the influence of\r\nthe field produced by both. The iron core is employed for obvious\r\nreasons, but it is not essential to the operation. To improve the\r\nmotor, the iron core is made to encircle the armature. Again to\r\nimprove, the secondary coil is made to overlap partly the primary, so\r\nthat it cannot free itself from a strong inductive action of the\r\nlatter, repel its lines as it may. Once more to improve, the proper\r\ndifference of phase is obtained between the primary and secondary\r\ncurrents by a condenser, self-induction, resistance or equivalent\r\nwindings.\r\n\r\nI had discovered, however, that rotation is produced by means of a\r\nsingle coil and core; my explanation of the phenomenon, and leading\r\nthought in trying the experiment, being that there must be a true time\r\nlag in the magnetization of the core. I remember the pleasure I had\r\nwhen, in the writings of Professor Ayrton, which came later to my\r\nhand, I found the idea of the time lag advocated. Whether there is a\r\ntrue time lag, or whether the retardation is due to eddy currents\r\ncirculating in minute paths, must remain an open question, but the\r\nfact is that a coil wound upon an iron core and traversed by an\r\nalternating current creates a moving field of force, capable of\r\nsetting an armature in rotation. It is of some interest, in\r\nconjunction with the historical Arago experiment, to mention that in\r\nlag or phase motors I have produced rotation in the opposite direction\r\nto the moving field, which means that in that experiment the magnet\r\nmay not rotate, or may even rotate in the opposite direction to the\r\nmoving disc. Here, then, is a motor (diagrammatically illustrated in\r\nFig. 17), comprising a coil and iron core, and a freely movable copper\r\ndisc in proximity to the latter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.--SINGLE WIRE AND \"NO-WIRE\" MOTOR.]\r\n\r\nTo demonstrate a novel and interesting feature, I have, for a reason\r\nwhich I will explain, selected this type of motor. When the ends of\r\nthe coil are connected to the terminals of an alternator the disc is\r\nset in rotation. But it is not this experiment, now well known, which\r\nI desire to perform. What I wish to show you is that this motor\r\nrotates with _one single_ connection between it and the generator;\r\nthat is to say, one terminal of the motor is connected to one terminal\r\nof the generator--in this case the secondary of a high-tension\r\ninduction coil--the other terminals of motor and generator being\r\ninsulated in space. To produce rotation it is generally (but not\r\nabsolutely) necessary to connect the free end of the motor coil to an\r\ninsulated body of some size. The experimenter's body is more than\r\nsufficient. If he touches the free terminal with an object held in the\r\nhand, a current passes through the coil and the copper disc is set in\r\nrotation. If an exhausted tube is put in series with the coil, the\r\ntube lights brilliantly, showing the passage of a strong current.\r\nInstead of the experimenter's body, a small metal sheet suspended on a\r\ncord may be used with the same result. In this case the plate acts as\r\na condenser in series with the coil. It counteracts the self-induction\r\nof the latter and allows a strong current to pass. In such a\r\ncombination, the greater the self-induction of the coil the smaller\r\nneed be the plate, and this means that a lower frequency, or\r\neventually a lower potential, is required to operate the motor. A\r\nsingle coil wound upon a core has a high self-induction; for this\r\nreason principally, this type of motor was chosen to perform the\r\nexperiment. Were a secondary closed coil wound upon the core, it would\r\ntend to diminish the self-induction, and then it would be necessary to\r\nemploy a much higher frequency and potential. Neither would be\r\nadvisable, for a higher potential would endanger the insulation of the\r\nsmall primary coil, and a higher frequency would result in a\r\nmaterially diminished torque.\r\n\r\nIt should be remarked that when such a motor with a closed secondary\r\nis used, it is not at all easy to obtain rotation with excessive\r\nfrequencies, as the secondary cuts off almost completely the lines of\r\nthe primary--and this, of course, the more, the higher the\r\nfrequency--and allows the passage of but a minute current. In such a\r\ncase, unless the secondary is closed through a condenser, it is almost\r\nessential, in order to produce rotation, to make the primary and\r\nsecondary coils overlap each other more or less.\r\n\r\nBut there is an additional feature of interest about this motor,\r\nnamely, it is not necessary to have even a single connection between\r\nthe motor and generator, except, perhaps, through the ground: for not\r\nonly is an insulated plate capable of giving off energy into space,\r\nbut it is likewise capable of deriving it from an alternating\r\nelectrostatic field, though in the latter case the available energy is\r\nmuch smaller. In this instance one of the motor terminals is connected\r\nto the insulated plate or body located within the alternating\r\nelectrostatic field, and the other terminal preferably to the ground.\r\n\r\nIt is quite possible, however, that such \"no-wire\" motors, as they\r\nmight be called, could be operated by conduction through the rarefied\r\nair at considerable distances. Alternate currents, especially of high\r\nfrequencies, pass with astonishing freedom through even slightly\r\nrarefied gases. The upper strata of the air are rarefied. To reach a\r\nnumber of miles out into space requires the overcoming of difficulties\r\nof a merely mechanical nature. There is no doubt that with the\r\nenormous potentials obtainable by the use of high frequencies and oil\r\ninsulation luminous discharges might be passed through many miles of\r\nrarefied air, and that, by thus directing the energy of many hundreds\r\nor thousands of horse-power, motors or lamps might be operated at\r\nconsiderable distances from stationary sources. But such schemes are\r\nmentioned merely as possibilities. We shall have no need to transmit\r\npower in this way. We shall have no need to _transmit_ power at all.\r\nEre many generations pass, our machinery will be driven by a power\r\nobtainable at any point of the universe. This idea is not novel. Men\r\nhave been led to it long ago by instinct or reason. It has been\r\nexpressed in many ways, and in many places, in the history of old and\r\nnew. We find it in the delightful myth of Antheus, who derives power\r\nfrom the earth; we find it among the subtile speculations of one of\r\nyour splendid mathematicians, and in many hints and statements of\r\nthinkers of the present time. Throughout space there is energy. Is\r\nthis energy static or kinetic? If static our hopes are in vain; if\r\nkinetic--and this we know it is, for certain--then it is a mere\r\nquestion of time when men will succeed in attaching their machinery to\r\nthe very wheelwork of nature. Of all, living or dead, Crookes came\r\nnearest to doing it. His radiometer will turn in the light of day and\r\nin the darkness of the night; it will turn everywhere where there is\r\nheat, and heat is everywhere. But, unfortunately, this beautiful\r\nlittle machine, while it goes down to posterity as the most\r\ninteresting, must likewise be put on record as the most inefficient\r\nmachine ever invented!\r\n\r\nThe preceding experiment is only one of many equally interesting\r\nexperiments which may be performed by the use of only one wire with\r\nalternate currents of high potential and frequency. We may connect an\r\ninsulated line to a source of such currents, we may pass an\r\ninappreciable current over the line, and on any point of the same we\r\nare able to obtain a heavy current, capable of fusing a thick copper\r\nwire. Or we may, by the help of some artifice, decompose a solution in\r\nany electrolytic cell by connecting only one pole of the cell to the\r\nline or source of energy. Or we may, by attaching to the line, or only\r\nbringing into its vicinity, light up an incandescent lamp, an\r\nexhausted tube, or a phosphorescent bulb.\r\n\r\nHowever impracticable this plan of working may appear in many cases,\r\nit certainly seems practicable, and even recommendable, in the\r\nproduction of light. A perfected lamp would require but little energy,\r\nand if wires were used at all we ought to be able to supply that\r\nenergy without a return wire.\r\n\r\nIt is now a fact that a body may be rendered incandescent or\r\nphosphorescent by bringing it either in single contact or merely in\r\nthe vicinity of a source of electric impulses of the proper character,\r\nand that in this manner a quantity of light sufficient to afford a\r\npractical illuminant may be produced. It is, therefore, to say the\r\nleast, worth while to attempt to determine the best conditions and to\r\ninvent the best appliances for attaining this object.\r\n\r\nSome experiences have already been gained in this direction, and I\r\nwill dwell on them briefly, in the hope that they might prove useful.\r\n\r\nThe heating of a conducting body inclosed in a bulb, and connected to\r\na source of rapidly alternating electric impulses, is dependent on so\r\nmany things of a different nature, that it would be difficult to give\r\na generally applicable rule under which the maximum heating occurs. As\r\nregards the size of the vessel, I have lately found that at ordinary\r\nor only slightly differing atmospheric pressures, when air is a good\r\ninsulator, and hence practically the same amount of energy by a\r\ncertain potential and frequency is given off from the body, whether\r\nthe bulb be small or large, the body is brought to a higher\r\ntemperature if inclosed in a small bulb, because of the better\r\nconfinement of heat in this case.\r\n\r\nAt lower pressures, when air becomes more or less conducting, or if\r\nthe air be sufficiently warmed as to become conducting, the body is\r\nrendered more intensely incandescent in a large bulb, obviously\r\nbecause, under otherwise equal conditions of test, more energy may be\r\ngiven off from the body when the bulb is large.\r\n\r\nAt very high degrees of exhaustion, when the matter in the bulb\r\nbecomes \"radiant,\" a large bulb has still an advantage, but a\r\ncomparatively slight one, over the small bulb.\r\n\r\nFinally, at excessively high degrees of exhaustion, which cannot be\r\nreached except by the employment of special means, there seems to be,\r\nbeyond a certain and rather small size of vessel, no perceptible\r\ndifference in the heating.\r\n\r\nThese observations were the result of a number of experiments, of\r\nwhich one, showing the effect of the size of the bulb at a high degree\r\nof exhaustion, may be described and shown here, as it presents a\r\nfeature of interest. Three spherical bulbs of 2 inches, 3 inches and 4\r\ninches diameter were taken, and in the centre of each was mounted an\r\nequal length of an ordinary incandescent lamp filament of uniform\r\nthickness. In each bulb the piece of filament was fastened to the\r\nleading-in wire of platinum, contained in a glass stem sealed in the\r\nbulb; care being taken, of course, to make everything as nearly alike\r\nas possible. On each glass stem in the inside of the bulb was slipped\r\na highly polished tube made of aluminium sheet, which fitted the stem\r\nand was held on it by spring pressure. The function of this aluminium\r\ntube will be explained subsequently. In each bulb an equal length of\r\nfilament protruded above the metal tube. It is sufficient to say now\r\nthat under these conditions equal lengths of filament of the same\r\nthickness--in other words, bodies of equal bulk--were brought to\r\nincandescence. The three bulbs were sealed to a glass tube, which was\r\nconnected to a Sprengel pump. When a high vacuum had been reached, the\r\nglass tube carrying the bulbs was sealed off. A current was then\r\nturned on successively on each bulb, and it was found that the\r\nfilaments came to about the same brightness, and, if anything, the\r\nsmallest bulb, which was placed midway between the two larger ones,\r\nmay have been slightly brighter. This result was expected, for when\r\neither of the bulbs was connected to the coil the luminosity spread\r\nthrough the other two, hence the three bulbs constituted really one\r\nvessel. When all the three bulbs were connected in multiple arc to the\r\ncoil, in the largest of them the filament glowed brightest, in the\r\nnext smaller it was a little less bright, and in the smallest it only\r\ncame to redness. The bulbs were then sealed off and separately tried.\r\nThe brightness of the filaments was now such as would have been\r\nexpected on the supposition that the energy given off was\r\nproportionate to the surface of the bulb, this surface in each case\r\nrepresenting one of the coatings of a condenser. Accordingly, time\r\nwas less difference between the largest and the middle sized than\r\nbetween the latter and the smallest bulb.\r\n\r\nAn interesting observation was made in this experiment. The three\r\nbulbs were suspended from a straight bare wire connected to a terminal\r\nof the coil, the largest bulb being placed at the end of the wire, at\r\nsome distance from it the smallest bulb, and an equal distance from\r\nthe latter the middle-sized one. The carbons glowed then in both the\r\nlarger bulbs about as expected, but the smallest did not get its share\r\nby far. This observation led me to exchange the position of the bulbs,\r\nand I then observed that whichever of the bulbs was in the middle it\r\nwas by far less bright than it was in any other position. This\r\nmystifying result was, of course, found to be due to the electrostatic\r\naction between the bulbs. When they were placed at a considerable\r\ndistance, or when they were attached to the corners of an equilateral\r\ntriangle of copper wire, they glowed about in the order determined by\r\ntheir surfaces.\r\n\r\nAs to the shape of the vessel, it is also of some importance,\r\nespecially at high degrees of exhaustion. Of all the possible\r\nconstructions, it seems that a spherical globe with the refractory\r\nbody mounted in its centre is the best to employ. In experience it has\r\nbeen demonstrated that in such a globe a refractory body of a given\r\nbulk is more easily brought to incandescence than when otherwise\r\nshaped bulbs are used. There is also an advantage in giving to the\r\nincandescent body the shape of a sphere, for self-evident reasons. In\r\nany case the body should be mounted in the centre, where the atoms\r\nrebounding from the glass collide. This object is best attained in\r\nthe spherical bulb; but it is also attained in a cylindrical vessel\r\nwith one or two straight filaments coinciding with its axis, and\r\npossibly also in parabolical or spherical bulbs with the refractory\r\nbody or bodies placed in the focus or foci of the same; though the\r\nlatter is not probable, as the electrified atoms should in all cases\r\nrebound normally from the surface they strike, unless the speed were\r\nexcessive, in which case they _would_ probably follow the general law\r\nof reflection. No matter what shape the vessel may have, if the\r\nexhaustion be low, a filament mounted in the globe is brought to the\r\nsame degree of incandescence in all parts; but if the exhaustion be\r\nhigh and the bulb be spherical or pear-shaped, as usual, focal points\r\nform and the filament is heated to a higher degree at or near such\r\npoints.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the effect, I have here two small bulbs which are alike,\r\nonly one is exhausted to a low and the other to a very high degree.\r\nWhen connected to the coil, the filament in the former glows uniformly\r\nthroughout all its length; whereas in the latter, that portion of the\r\nfilament which is in the centre of the bulb glows far more intensely\r\nthan the rest. A curious point is that the phenomenon occurs even if\r\ntwo filaments are mounted in a bulb, each being connected to one\r\nterminal of the coil, and, what is still more curious, if they be very\r\nnear together, provided the vacuum be very high. I noted in\r\nexperiments with such bulbs that the filaments would give way usually\r\nat a certain point, and in the first trials I attributed it to a\r\ndefect in the carbon. But when the phenomenon occurred many times in\r\nsuccession I recognized its real cause.\r\n\r\nIn order to bring a refractory body inclosed in a bulb to\r\nincandescence, it is desirable, on account of economy, that all the\r\nenergy supplied to the bulb from the source should reach without loss\r\nthe body to be heated; from there, and from nowhere else, it should be\r\nradiated. It is, of course, out of the question to reach this\r\ntheoretical result, but it is possible by a proper construction of the\r\nilluminating device to approximate it more or less.\r\n\r\nFor many reasons, the refractory body is placed in the centre of the\r\nbulb, and it is usually supported on a glass stem containing the\r\nleading-in wire. As the potential of this wire is alternated, the\r\nrarefied gas surrounding the stem is acted upon inductively, and the\r\nglass stem is violently bombarded and heated. In this manner by far\r\nthe greater portion of the energy supplied to the bulb--especially\r\nwhen exceedingly high frequencies are used--may be lost for the\r\npurpose contemplated. To obviate this loss, or at least to reduce it\r\nto a minimum, I usually screen the rarefied gas surrounding the stem\r\nfrom the inductive action of the leading-in wire by providing the stem\r\nwith a tube or coating of conducting material. It seems beyond doubt\r\nthat the best among metals to employ for this purpose is aluminium, on\r\naccount of its many remarkable properties. Its only fault is that it\r\nis easily fusible, and, therefore, its distance from the incandescing\r\nbody should be properly estimated. Usually, a thin tube, of a diameter\r\nsomewhat smaller than that of the glass stem, is made of the finest\r\naluminium sheet, and slipped on the stem. The tube is conveniently\r\nprepared by wrapping around a rod fastened in a lathe a piece of\r\naluminium sheet of the proper size, grasping the sheet firmly with\r\nclean chamois leather or blotting paper, and spinning the rod very\r\nfast. The sheet is wound tightly around the rod, and a highly polished\r\ntube of one or three layers of the sheet is obtained. When slipped on\r\nthe stem, the pressure is generally sufficient to prevent it from\r\nslipping off, but, for safety, the lower edge of the sheet may be\r\nturned inside. The upper inside corner of the sheet--that is, the one\r\nwhich is nearest to the refractory incandescent body--should be cut\r\nout diagonally, as it often happens that, in consequence of the\r\nintense heat, this corner turns toward the inside and comes very near\r\nto, or in contact with, the wire, or filament, supporting the\r\nrefractory body. The greater part of the energy supplied to the bulb\r\nis then used up in heating the metal tube, and the bulb is rendered\r\nuseless for the purpose. The aluminium sheet should project above the\r\nglass stem more or less--one inch or so--or else, if the glass be too\r\nclose to the incandescing body, it may be strongly heated and become\r\nmore or less conducting, whereupon it may be ruptured, or may, by its\r\nconductivity, establish a good electrical connection between the metal\r\ntube and the leading-in wire, in which case, again, most of the energy\r\nwill be lost in heating the former. Perhaps the best way is to make\r\nthe top of the glass tube, for about an inch, of a much smaller\r\ndiameter. To still further reduce the danger arising from the heating\r\nof the glass stem, and also with the view of preventing an electrical\r\nconnection between the metal tube and the electrode, I preferably wrap\r\nthe stem with several layers of thin mica, which extends at least as\r\nfar as the metal tube. In some bulbs I have also used an outside\r\ninsulating cover.\r\n\r\nThe preceding remarks are only made to aid the experimenter in the\r\nfirst trials, for the difficulties which he encounters he may soon\r\nfind means to overcome in his own way.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the effect of the screen, and the advantage of using it,\r\nI have here two bulbs of the same size, with their stems, leading-in\r\nwires and incandescent lamp filaments tied to the latter, as nearly\r\nalike as possible. The stem of one bulb is provided with an aluminium\r\ntube, the stem of the other has none. Originally the two bulbs were\r\njoined by a tube which was connected to a Sprengel pump. When a high\r\nvacuum had been reached, first the connecting tube, and then the\r\nbulbs, were sealed off; they are therefore of the same degree of\r\nexhaustion. When they are separately connected to the coil giving a\r\ncertain potential, the carbon filament in the bulb provided with the\r\naluminium screen is rendered highly incandescent, while the filament\r\nin the other bulb may, with the same potential, not even come to\r\nredness, although in reality the latter bulb takes generally more\r\nenergy than the former. When they are both connected together to the\r\nterminal, the difference is even more apparent, showing the importance\r\nof the screening. The metal tube placed on the stem containing the\r\nleading-in wire performs really two distinct functions: First: it acts\r\nmore or less as an electrostatic screen, thus economizing the energy\r\nsupplied to the bulb; and, second, to whatever extent it may fail to\r\nact electrostatically, it acts mechanically, preventing the\r\nbombardment, and consequently intense heating and possible\r\ndeterioration of the slender support of the refractory incandescent\r\nbody, or of the glass stem containing the leading-in wire. I say\r\n_slender_ support, for it is evident that in order to confine the heat\r\nmore completely to the incandescing body its support should be very\r\nthin, so as to carry away the smallest possible amount of heat by\r\nconduction. Of all the supports used I have found an ordinary\r\nincandescent lamp filament to be the best, principally because among\r\nconductors it can withstand the highest degrees of heat.\r\n\r\nThe effectiveness of the metal tube as an electrostatic screen depends\r\nlargely on the degree of exhaustion.\r\n\r\nAt excessively high degrees of exhaustion--which are reached by using\r\ngreat care and special means in connection with the Sprengel\r\npump--when the matter in the globe is in the ultra-radiant state, it\r\nacts most perfectly. The shadow of the upper edge of the tube is then\r\nsharply defined upon the bulb.\r\n\r\nAt a somewhat lower degree of exhaustion, which is about the ordinary\r\n\"non-striking\" vacuum, and generally as long as the matter moves\r\npredominantly in straight lines, the screen still does well. In\r\nelucidation of the preceding remark it is necessary to state that what\r\nis a \"non-striking\" vacuum for a coil operated, as ordinarily, by\r\nimpulses, or currents, of low-frequency, is not, by far, so when the\r\ncoil is operated by currents of very high frequency. In such case the\r\ndischarge may pass with great freedom through the rarefied gas through\r\nwhich a low-frequency discharge may not pass, even though the\r\npotential be much higher. At ordinary atmospheric pressures just the\r\nreverse rule holds good: the higher the frequency, the less the spark\r\ndischarge is able to jump between the terminals, especially if they\r\nare knobs or spheres of some size.\r\n\r\nFinally, at very low degrees of exhaustion, when the gas is well\r\nconducting, the metal tube not only does not act as an electrostatic\r\nscreen, but even is a drawback, aiding to a considerable extent the\r\ndissipation of the energy laterally from the leading-in wire. This, of\r\ncourse, is to be expected. In this case, namely, the metal tube is in\r\ngood electrical connection with the leading-in wire, and most of the\r\nbombardment is directed upon the tube. As long as the electrical\r\nconnection is not good, the conducting tube is always of some\r\nadvantage, for although it may not greatly economize energy, still it\r\nprotects the support of the refractory button, and is a means for\r\nconcentrating more energy upon the same.\r\n\r\nTo whatever extent the aluminium tube performs the function of a\r\nscreen, its usefulness is therefore limited to very high degrees of\r\nexhaustion when it is insulated from the electrode--that is, when the\r\ngas as a whole is non-conducting, and the molecules, or atoms, act as\r\nindependent carriers of electric charges.\r\n\r\nIn addition to acting as a more or less effective screen, in the true\r\nmeaning of the word, the conducting tube or coating may also act, by\r\nreason of its conductivity, as a sort of equalizer or dampener of the\r\nbombardment against the stem. To be explicit, I assume the action as\r\nfollows: Suppose a rhythmical bombardment to occur against the\r\nconducting tube by reason of its imperfect action as a screen, it\r\ncertainly must happen that some molecules, or atoms, strike the tube\r\nsooner than others. Those which come first in contact with it give up\r\ntheir superfluous charge, and the tube is electrified, the\r\nelectrification instantly spreading over its surface. But this must\r\ndiminish the energy lost in the bombardment for two reasons: first,\r\nthe charge given up by the atoms spreads over a great area, and hence\r\nthe electric density at any point is small, and the atoms are repelled\r\nwith less energy than they would be if they would strike against a\r\ngood insulator: secondly, as the tube is electrified by the atoms\r\nwhich first come in contact with it, the progress of the following\r\natoms against the tube is more or less checked by the repulsion which\r\nthe electrified tube must exert upon the similarly electrified atoms.\r\nThis repulsion may perhaps be sufficient to prevent a large portion of\r\nthe atoms from striking the tube, but at any rate it must diminish the\r\nenergy of their impact. It is clear that when the exhaustion is very\r\nlow, and the rarefied gas well conducting, neither of the above\r\neffects can occur, and, on the other hand, the fewer the atoms, with\r\nthe greater freedom they move; in other words, the higher the degree\r\nof exhaustion, up to a limit, the more telling will be both the\r\neffects.\r\n\r\nWhat I have just said may afford an explanation of the phenomenon\r\nobserved by Prof. Crookes, namely, that a discharge through a bulb is\r\nestablished with much greater facility when an insulator than when a\r\nconductor is present in the same. In my opinion, the conductor acts as\r\na dampener of the motion of the atoms in the two ways pointed out;\r\nhence, to cause a visible discharge to pass through the bulb, a much\r\nhigher potential is needed if a conductor, especially of much surface,\r\nbe present.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of clearness of some of the remarks before made, I must\r\nnow refer to Figs. 18, 19 and 20, which illustrate various\r\narrangements with a type of bulb most generally used.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.--BULB WITH MICA TUBE AND ALUMINIUM SCREEN.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.--IMPROVED BULB WITH SOCKET AND SCREEN.]\r\n\r\nFig. 18 is a section through a spherical bulb L, with the glass stem\r\ns, containing the leading-in wire w; which has a lamp filament l\r\nfastened to it, serving to support the refractory button m in the\r\ncentre. M is a sheet of thin mica wound in several layers around the\r\nstem s, and a is the aluminium tube.\r\n\r\nFig. 19 illustrates such a bulb in a somewhat more advanced stage of\r\nperfection. A metallic tube S is fastened by means of some cement to\r\nthe neck of the tube. In the tube is screwed a plug P, of insulating\r\nmaterial, in the centre of which is fastened a metallic terminal t,\r\nfor the connection to the leading-in wire w. This terminal must be\r\nwell insulated from the metal tube S, therefore, if the cement used is\r\nconducting--and most generally it is sufficiently so--the space\r\nbetween the plug P and the neck of the bulb should be filled with some\r\ngood insulating material, as mica powder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.--BULB FOR EXPERIMENTS WITH CONDUCTING TUBE.]\r\n\r\nFig. 20 shows a bulb made for experimental purposes. In this bulb the\r\naluminium tube is provided with an external connection, which serves\r\nto investigate the effect of the tube under various conditions. It is\r\nreferred to chiefly to suggest a line of experiment followed.\r\n\r\nSince the bombardment against the stem containing the leading-in wire\r\nis due to the inductive action of the latter upon the rarefied gas, it\r\nis of advantage to reduce this action as far as practicable by\r\nemploying a very thin wire, surrounded by a very thick insulation of\r\nglass or other material, and by making the wire passing through the\r\nrarefied gas as short as practicable. To combine these features I\r\nemploy a large tube T (Fig. 21), which protrudes into the bulb to some\r\ndistance, and carries on the top a very short glass stem s, into which\r\nis sealed the leading-in wire w, and I protect the top of the glass\r\nstem against the heat by a small, aluminium tube a and a layer of mica\r\nunderneath the same, as usual. The wire w, passing through the large\r\ntube to the outside of the bulb, should be well insulated--with a\r\nglass tube, for instance--and the space between ought to be filled out\r\nwith some excellent insulator. Among many insulating powders I have\r\ntried, I have found that mica powder is the best to employ. If this\r\nprecaution is not taken, the tube T, protruding into the bulb, will\r\nsurely be cracked in consequence of the heating by the brushes which\r\nare apt to form in the upper part of the tube, near the exhausted\r\nglobe, especially if the vacuum be excellent, and therefore the\r\npotential necessary to operate the lamp very high.\r\n\r\nFig. 22 illustrates a similar arrangement, with a large tube T\r\nprotruding in to the part of the bulb containing the refractors button\r\nm. In this case the wire leading from the outside into the bulb is\r\nomitted, the energy required being supplied through condenser coatings\r\nCC. The insulating packing P should in this construction be tightly\r\nfitting to the glass, and rather wide, or otherwise the discharge\r\nmight avoid passing through the wire w, which connects the inside\r\ncondenser coating to the incandescent button m. The molecular\r\nbombardment against the glass stem in the bulb is a source of great\r\ntrouble. As illustration I will cite a phenomenon only too frequently\r\nand unwillingly observed. A bulb, preferably a large one, may be\r\ntaken, and a good conducting body, such as a piece of carbon, may be\r\nmounted in it upon a platinum wire sealed in the glass stem. The bulb\r\nmay be exhausted to a fairly high degree, nearly to the point when\r\nphosphorescence begins to appear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.--IMPROVED BULB WITH NON-CONDUCTING BUTTON.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.--TYPE OF BULB WITHOUT LEADING-IN WIRE.]\r\n\r\nWhen the bulb is connected with the coil, the piece of carbon, if\r\nsmall, may become highly incandescent at first, but its brightness\r\nimmediately diminishes, and then the discharge may break through the\r\nglass somewhere in the middle of the stem, in the form of bright\r\nsparks, in spite of the fact that the platinum wire is in good\r\nelectrical connection with the rarefied gas through the piece of\r\ncarbon or metal at the top. The first sparks are singularly bright,\r\nrecalling those drawn from a clear surface of mercury. But, as they\r\nheat the glass rapidly, they, of course, lose their brightness, and\r\ncease when the glass at the ruptured place becomes incandescent, or\r\ngenerally sufficiently hot to conduct. When observed for the first\r\ntime the phenomenon must appear very curious, and shows in a striking\r\nmanner how radically different alternate currents, or impulses, of\r\nhigh frequency behave, as compared with steady currents, or currents\r\nof low frequency. With such currents--namely, the latter--the\r\nphenomenon would of course not occur. When frequencies such as are\r\nobtained by mechanical means are used, I think that the rupture of the\r\nglass is more or less the consequence of the bombardment, which warms\r\nit up and impairs its insulating power; but with frequencies\r\nobtainable with condensers I have no doubt that the glass may give way\r\nwithout previous heating. Although this appears most singular at\r\nfirst, it is in reality what we might expect to occur. The energy\r\nsupplied to the wire leading into the bulb is given off partly by\r\ndirect action through the carbon button, and partly by inductive\r\naction through the glass surrounding the wire. The case is thus\r\nanalogous to that in which a condenser shunted by a conductor of low\r\nresistance is connected to a source of alternating currents. As long\r\nas the frequencies are low, the conductor gets the most, and the\r\ncondenser is perfectly safe: but when the frequency becomes excessive,\r\nthe _role_ of the conductor may become quite insignificant. In the\r\nlatter case the difference of potential at the terminals of the\r\ncondenser may become so great as to rupture the dielectric,\r\nnotwithstanding the fact that the terminals are joined by a conductor\r\nof low resistance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.--EFFECT PRODUCED BY A RUBY DROP.]\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, not necessary, when it is desired to produce the\r\nincandescence of a body inclosed in a bulb by means of these currents,\r\nthat the body should be a conductor, for even a perfect non-conductor\r\nmay be quite as readily heated. For this purpose it is sufficient to\r\nsurround a conducting electrode with a non-conducting material, as,\r\nfor instance, in the bulb described before in Fig. 21, in which a thin\r\nincandescent lamp filament is coated with a non-conductor, and\r\nsupports a button of the same material on the top. At the start the\r\nbombardment goes on by inductive action through the non-conductor,\r\nuntil the same is sufficiently heated to become conducting, when the\r\nbombardment continues in the ordinary way.\r\n\r\nA different arrangement used in some of the bulbs constructed is\r\nillustrated in Fig. 23. In this instance a non-conductor m is\r\nmounted in a piece of common arc light carbon so as to project some\r\nsmall distance above the latter. The carbon piece is connected to the\r\nleading-in wire passing through a glass stem, which is wrapped with\r\nseveral layers of mica. An aluminium tube a is employed as usual for\r\nscreening. It is so arranged that it reaches very nearly as high as\r\nthe carbon and only the non-conductor m projects a little above it.\r\nThe bombardment goes at first against the upper surface of carbon, the\r\nlower parts being protected by the aluminium tube. As soon, however,\r\nas the non-conductor m is heated it is rendered good conducting, and\r\nthen it becomes the centre of the bombardment, being most exposed to\r\nthe same.\r\n\r\nI have also constructed during these experiments many such single-wire\r\nbulbs with or without internal electrode, in which the radiant matter\r\nwas projected against, or focused upon, the body to be rendered\r\nincandescent. Fig. 24 illustrates one of the bulbs used. It consists\r\nof a spherical globe L, provided with a long neck n, on the top, for\r\nincreasing the action in some cases by the application of an external\r\nconducting coating. The globe L is blown out on the bottom into a very\r\nsmall bulb b, which serves to hold it firmly in a socket S of\r\ninsulating material into which it is cemented. A fine lamp filament f,\r\nsupported on a wire w, passes through the centre of the globe L. The\r\nfilament is rendered incandescent in the middle portion, where the\r\nbombardment proceeding from the lower inside surface of the globe is\r\nmost intense. The lower portion of the globe, as far as the socket S\r\nreaches, is rendered conducting, either by a tinfoil coating or\r\notherwise, and the external electrode is connected to a terminal of\r\nthe coil.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement diagrammatically indicated in Fig. 24 was found to be\r\nan inferior one when it was desired to render incandescent a filament\r\nor button supported in the centre of the globe, but it was convenient\r\nwhen the object was to excite phosphorescence.\r\n\r\nIn many experiments in which bodies of a different kind were mounted\r\nin the bulb as, for instance, indicated in Fig. 23, some observations\r\nof interest were made.\r\n\r\nIt was found, among other things, that in such cases, no matter where\r\nthe bombardment began, just as soon as a high temperature was reached\r\nthere was generally one of the bodies which seemed to take most of the\r\nbombardment upon itself, the other, or others, being thereby relieved.\r\nThis quality appeared to depend principally on the point of fusion,\r\nand on the facility with which the body was \"evaporated,\" or,\r\ngenerally speaking, disintegrated--meaning by the latter term not only\r\nthe throwing off of atoms, but likewise of larger lumps. The\r\nobservation made was in accordance with generally accepted notions. In\r\na highly exhausted bulb electricity is carried off from the electrode\r\nby independent carriers, which are partly the atoms, or molecules, of\r\nthe residual atmosphere, and partly the atoms, molecules, or lumps\r\nthrown off from the electrode. If the electrode is composed of bodies\r\nof different character, and if one of these is more easily\r\ndisintegrated than the others, most of the electricity supplied is\r\ncarried off from that body, which is then brought to a higher\r\ntemperature than the others, and this the more, as upon an increase of\r\nthe temperature the body is still more easily disintegrated.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me quite probable that a similar process takes place in\r\nthe bulb even with a homogeneous electrode, and I think it to be the\r\nprincipal cause of the disintegration. There is bound to be some\r\nirregularity, even if the surface is highly polished, which, of\r\ncourse, is impossible with most of the refractory bodies employed as\r\nelectrodes. Assume that a point of the electrode gets hotter,\r\ninstantly most of the discharge passes through that point, and a\r\nminute patch is probably fused and evaporated. It is now possible that\r\nin consequence of the violent disintegration the spot attacked sinks\r\nin temperature, or that a counter force is created, as in an arc; at\r\nany rate, the local tearing off meets with the limitations incident to\r\nthe experiment, whereupon the same process occurs on another place. To\r\nthe eye the electrode appears uniformly brilliant, but there are upon\r\nit points constantly shifting and wandering around, of a temperature\r\nfar above the mean, and this materially hastens the process of\r\ndeterioration. That some such thing occurs, at least when the\r\nelectrode is at a lower temperature, sufficient experimental evidence\r\ncan be obtained in the following manner: Exhaust a bulb to a very high\r\ndegree, so that with a fairly high potential the discharge cannot\r\npass--that is, not a _luminous_ one, for a weak invisible discharge\r\noccurs always, in all probability. Now raise slowly and carefully the\r\npotential, leaving the primary current on no more than for an instant.\r\nAt a certain point, two, three, or half a dozen phosphorescent spots\r\nwill appear on the globe. These places of the glass are evidently more\r\nviolently bombarded than others, this being due to the unevenly\r\ndistributed electric density, necessitated, of course, by sharp\r\nprojections, or, generally speaking, irregularities of the electrode.\r\nBut the luminous patches are constantly changing in position, which is\r\nespecially well observable if one manages to produce very few, and\r\nthis indicates that the configuration of the electrode is rapidly\r\nchanging.\r\n\r\nFrom experiences of this kind I am led to infer that, in order to be\r\nmost durable, the refractory button in the bulb should be in the form\r\nof a sphere with a highly polished surface. Such a small sphere could\r\nbe manufactured from a diamond or some other crystal, but a better way\r\nwould be to fuse, by the employment of extreme degrees of temperature,\r\nsome oxide--as, for instance, zirconia--into a small drop, and then\r\nkeep it in the bulb at a temperature somewhat below its point of\r\nfusion.\r\n\r\nInteresting and useful results can no doubt be reached in the\r\ndirection of extreme degrees of heat. How can such high temperatures\r\nbe arrived at? How are the highest degrees of heat reached in nature?\r\nBy the impact of stars, by high speeds and collisions. In a collision\r\nany rate of heat generation may be attained. In a chemical process we\r\nare limited. When oxygen and hydrogen combine, they fall,\r\nmetaphorically speaking, from a definite height. We cannot go very far\r\nwith a blast, nor by confining heat in a furnace, but in an exhausted\r\nbulb we can concentrate any amount of energy upon a minute button.\r\nLeaving practicability out of consideration, this, then, would be the\r\nmeans which, in my opinion, would enable us to reach the highest\r\ntemperature. But a great difficulty when proceeding in this way is\r\nencountered, namely, in most cases the body is carried off before it\r\ncan fuse and form a drop. This difficulty exists principally with an\r\noxide such as zirconia, because it cannot be compressed in so hard a\r\ncake that it would not be carried off quickly. I endeavored repeatedly\r\nto fuse zirconia, placing it in a cup or arc light carbon as indicated\r\nin Fig. 23. It glowed with a most intense light, and the stream of the\r\nparticles projected out of the carbon cup was of a vivid white: but\r\nwhether it was compressed in a cake or made into a paste with carbon,\r\nit was carried off before it could be fused. The carbon cup containing\r\nthe zirconia had to be mounted very low in the neck of a large bulb,\r\nas the heating of the glass by the projected particles of the oxide\r\nwas so rapid that in the first trial the bulb was cracked almost in an\r\ninstant when the current was turned on. The heating of the glass by\r\nthe projected particles was found to be always greater when the carbon\r\ncup contained a body which was rapidly carried off--I presume because\r\nin such cases, with the same potential, higher speeds were reached,\r\nand also because, per unit of time, more matter was projected--that\r\nis, more particles would strike the glass.\r\n\r\nThe before mentioned difficulty did not exist, however, when the body\r\nmounted in the carbon cup offered great resistance to deterioration.\r\nFor instance, when an oxide was first fused in an oxygen blast and\r\nthen mounted in the bulb, it melted very readily into a drop.\r\n\r\nGenerally during the process of fusion magnificent light effects were\r\nnoted, of which it would be difficult to give an adequate idea. Fig.\r\n23 is intended to illustrate the effect observed with a ruby drop. At\r\nfirst one may see a narrow funnel of white light projected against the\r\ntop of the globe, where it produces an irregularly outlined\r\nphosphorescent patch. When the point of the ruby fuses the\r\nphosphorescence becomes very powerful; but as the atoms are projected\r\nwith much greater speed from the surface of the drop, soon the glass\r\ngets hot and \"tired,\" and now only the outer edge of the patch glows.\r\nIn this manner an intensely phosphorescent, sharply defined line, _l_,\r\ncorresponding to the outline of the drop, is produced, which spreads\r\nslowly over the globe as the drop gets larger. When the mass begins to\r\nboil, small bubbles and cavities are formed, which cause dark colored\r\nspots to sweep across the globe. The bulb may be turned downward\r\nwithout fear of the drop falling off, as the mass possesses\r\nconsiderable viscosity.\r\n\r\nI may mention here another feature of some interest, which I believe\r\nto have noted in the course of these experiments, though the\r\nobservations do not amount to a certitude. It _appeared_ that under\r\nthe molecular impact caused by the rapidly alternating potential the\r\nbody was fused and maintained in that state at a lower temperature in\r\na highly exhausted bulb than was the case at normal pressure and\r\napplication of heat in the ordinary way--that is, at least, judging\r\nfrom the quantity of the light emitted. One of the experiments\r\nperformed may be mentioned here by way of illustration. A small piece\r\nof pumice stone was stuck on a platinum wire, and first melted to it\r\nin a gas burner. The wire was next placed between two pieces of\r\ncharcoal and a burner applied so as to produce an intense heat,\r\nsufficient to melt down the pumice stone into a small glass-like\r\nbutton. The platinum wire had to be taken of sufficient thickness to\r\nprevent its melting in the fire. While in the charcoal fire, or when\r\nheld in a burner to get a better idea of the degree of heat, the\r\nbutton glowed with great brilliancy. The wire with the button was then\r\nmounted in a bulb, and upon exhausting the same to a high degree, the\r\ncurrent was turned on slowly so as to prevent the cracking of the\r\nbutton. The button was heated to the point of fusion, and when it\r\nmelted it did not, apparently, glow with the same brilliancy as\r\nbefore, and this would indicate a lower temperature. Leaving out of\r\nconsideration the observer's possible, and even probable, error, the\r\nquestion is, can a body under these conditions be brought from a solid\r\nto a liquid state with evolution of _less_ light?\r\n\r\nWhen the potential of a body is rapidly alternated it is certain that\r\nthe structure is jarred. When the potential is very high, although the\r\nvibrations may be few--say 20,000 per second--the effect upon the\r\nstructure may be considerable. Suppose, for example, that a ruby is\r\nmelted into a drop by a steady application of energy. When it forms a\r\ndrop it will emit visible and invisible waves, which will be in a\r\ndefinite ratio, and to the eye the drop will appear to be of a certain\r\nbrilliancy. Next, suppose we diminish to any degree we choose the\r\nenergy steadily supplied, and, instead, supply energy which rises and\r\nfalls according to a certain law. Now, when the drop is formed, there\r\nwill be emitted from it three different kinds of vibrations--the\r\nordinary visible, and two kinds of invisible waves: that is, the\r\nordinary dark waves of all lengths, and, in addition, waves of a well\r\ndefined character. The latter would not exist by a steady supply of\r\nthe energy; still they help to jar and loosen the structure. If this\r\nreally be the case, then the ruby drop will emit relatively less\r\nvisible and more invisible waves than before. Thus it would seem that\r\nwhen a platinum wire, for instance, is fused by currents alternating\r\nwith extreme rapidity, it emits at the point of fusion less light and\r\nmore invisible radiation than it does when melted by a steady current,\r\nthough the total energy used up in the process of fusion is the same\r\nin both cases. Or, to cite another example, a lamp filament is not\r\ncapable of withstanding as long with currents of extreme frequency as\r\nit does with steady currents, assuming that it be worked at the same\r\nluminous intensity. This means that for rapidly alternating currents\r\nthe filament should be shorter and thicker. The higher the\r\nfrequency--that is, the greater the departure from the steady\r\nflow--the worse it would be for the filament. But if the truth of this\r\nremark were demonstrated, it would be erroneous to conclude that such\r\na refractory button as used in these bulbs would be deteriorated\r\nquicker by currents of extremely high frequency than by steady or low\r\nfrequency currents. From experience I may say that just the opposite\r\nholds good: the button withstands the bombardment better with currents\r\nof very high frequency. But this is due to the fact that a high\r\nfrequency discharge passes through a rarefied gas with much greater\r\nfreedom than a steady or low frequency discharge, and this will say\r\nthat with the former we can work with a lower potential or with a less\r\nviolent impact. As long, then, as the gas is of no consequence, a\r\nsteady or low frequency current is better; but as soon as the action\r\nof the gas is desired and important, high frequencies are preferable.\r\n\r\nIn the course of these experiments a great many trials were made with\r\nall kinds of carbon buttons. Electrodes made of ordinary carbon\r\nbuttons were decidedly more durable when the buttons were obtained by\r\nthe application of enormous pressure. Electrodes prepared by\r\ndepositing carbon in well known ways did not show up well; they\r\nblackened the globe very quickly. From many experiences I conclude\r\nthat lamp filaments obtained in this manner can be advantageously used\r\nonly with low potentials and low frequency currents. Some kinds of\r\ncarbon withstand so well that, in order to bring them to the point of\r\nfusion, it is necessary to employ very small buttons. In this case the\r\nobservation is rendered very difficult on account of the intense heat\r\nproduced. Nevertheless there can be no doubt that all kinds of carbon\r\nare fused under the molecular bombardment, but the liquid state must\r\nbe one of great instability. Of all the bodies tried there were two\r\nwhich withstood best--diamond and carborundum. These two showed up\r\nabout equally, but the latter was preferable, for many reasons. As it\r\nis more than likely that this body is not yet generally known, I will\r\nventure to call your attention to it.\r\n\r\nIt has been recently produced by Mr. E.G. Acheson, of Monongahela\r\nCity, Pa., U.S.A. It is intended to replace ordinary diamond powder\r\nfor polishing precious stones, etc., and I have been informed that it\r\naccomplishes this object quite successfully. I do not know why the\r\nname \"carborundum\" has been given to it, unless there is something in\r\nthe process of its manufacture which justifies this selection. Through\r\nthe kindness of the inventor, I obtained a short while ago some\r\nsamples which I desired to test in regard to their qualities of\r\nphosphorescence and capability of withstanding high degrees of heat.\r\n\r\nCarborundum can be obtained in two forms--in the form of \"crystals\"\r\nand of powder. The former appear to the naked eye dark colored, but\r\nare very brilliant; the latter is of nearly the same color as ordinary\r\ndiamond powder, but very much finer. When viewed under a microscope\r\nthe samples of crystals given to me did not appear to have any\r\ndefinite form, but rather resembled pieces of broken up egg coal of\r\nfine quality. The majority were opaque, but there were some which were\r\ntransparent and colored. The crystals are a kind of carbon containing\r\nsome impurities; they are extremely hard, and withstand for a long\r\ntime even an oxygen blast. When the blast is directed against them\r\nthey at first form a cake of some compactness, probably in consequence\r\nof the fusion of impurities they contain. The mass withstands for a\r\nvery long time the blast without further fusion; but a slow carrying\r\noff, or burning, occurs, and, finally, a small quantity of a\r\nglass-like residue is left, which, I suppose, is melted alumina. When\r\ncompressed strongly they conduct very well, but not as well as\r\nordinary carbon. The powder, which is obtained from the crystals in\r\nsome way, is practically non-conducting. It affords a magnificent\r\npolishing material for stones.\r\n\r\nThe time has been too short to make a satisfactory study of the\r\nproperties of this product, but enough experience has been gained in a\r\nfew weeks I have experimented upon it to say that it does possess some\r\nremarkable properties in many respects. It withstands excessively high\r\ndegrees of heat, it is little deteriorated by molecular bombardment,\r\nand it does not blacken the globe as ordinary carbon does. The only\r\ndifficulty which I have found in its use in connection with these\r\nexperiments was to find some binding material which would resist the\r\nheat and the effect of the bombardment as successfully as carborundum\r\nitself does.\r\n\r\nI have here a number of bulbs which I have provided with buttons of\r\ncarborundum. To make such a button of carborundum crystals I proceed\r\nin the following manner: I take an ordinary lamp filament and dip its\r\npoint in tar, or some other thick substance or paint which may be\r\nreadily carbonized. I next pass the point of the filament through the\r\ncrystals, and then hold it vertically over a hot plate. The tar\r\nsoftens and forms a drop on the point of the filament, the crystals\r\nadhering to the surface of the drop. By regulating the distance from\r\nthe plate the tar is slowly dried out and the button becomes solid. I\r\nthen once more dip the button in tar and hold it again over a plate\r\nuntil the tar is evaporated, leaving only a hard mass which firmly\r\nbinds the crystals. When a larger button is required I repeat the\r\nprocess several times, and I generally also cover the filament a\r\ncertain distance below the button with crystals. The button being\r\nmounted in a bulb, when a good vacuum has been reached, first a weak\r\nand then a strong discharge is passed through the bulb to carbonize\r\nthe tar and expel all gases, and later it is brought to a very intense\r\nincandescence.\r\n\r\nWhen the powder is used I have found it best to proceed as follows: I\r\nmake a thick paint of carborundum and tar, and pass a lamp filament\r\nthrough the paint. Taking then most of the paint off by rubbing the\r\nfilament against a piece of chamois leather, I hold it over a hot\r\nplate until the tar evaporates and the coating becomes firm. I repeat\r\nthis process as many times as it is necessary to obtain a certain\r\nthickness of coating. On the point of the coated filament I form a\r\nbutton in the same manner.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that such a button--properly prepared under great\r\npressure--of carborundum, especially of powder of the best quality,\r\nwill withstand the effect of the bombardment fully as well as anything\r\nwe know. The difficulty is that the binding material gives way, and\r\nthe carborundum is slowly thrown off after some time. As it does not\r\nseem to blacken the globe in the least, it might be found useful for\r\ncoating the filaments of ordinary incandescent lamps, and I think that\r\nit is even possible to produce thin threads or sticks of carborundum\r\nwhich will replace the ordinary filaments in an incandescent lamp. A\r\ncarborundum coating seems to be more durable than other coatings, not\r\nonly because the carborundum can withstand high degrees of heat, but\r\nalso because it seems to unite with the carbon better than any other\r\nmaterial I have tried. A coating of zirconia or any other oxide, for\r\ninstance, is far more quickly destroyed. I prepared buttons of diamond\r\ndust in the same manner as of carborundum, and these came in\r\ndurability nearest to those prepared of carborundum, but the binding\r\npaste gave way much more quickly in the diamond buttons: this,\r\nhowever, I attributed to the size and irregularity of the grains of\r\nthe diamond.\r\n\r\nIt was of interest to find whether carborundum possesses the quality\r\nof phosphorescence. One is, of course, prepared to encounter two\r\ndifficulties: first, as regards the rough product, the \"crystals,\"\r\nthey are good conducting, and it is a fact that conductors do not\r\nphosphoresce; second, the powder, being exceedingly fine, would not be\r\napt to exhibit very prominently this quality, since we know that when\r\ncrystals, even such as diamond or ruby, are finely powdered, they lose\r\nthe property of phosphorescence to a considerable degree.\r\n\r\nThe question presents itself here, can a conductor phosphoresce? What\r\nis there in such a body as a metal, for instance, that would deprive\r\nit of the quality of phosphorescence, unless it is that property which\r\ncharacterizes it as a conductor? for it is a fact that most of the\r\nphosphorescent bodies lose that quality when they are sufficiently\r\nheated to become more or less conducting. Then, if a metal be in a\r\nlarge measure, or perhaps entirely, deprived of that property, it\r\nshould be capable of phosphorescence. Therefore it is quite possible\r\nthat at some extremely high frequency, when behaving practically as a\r\nnon-conductor, a metal or any other conductor might exhibit the\r\nquality of phosphorescence, even though it be entirely incapable of\r\nphosphorescing under the impact of a low-frequency discharge. There\r\nis, however, another possible way how a conductor might at least\r\n_appear_ to phosphoresce.\r\n\r\nConsiderable doubt still exists as to what really is phosphorescence,\r\nand as to whether the various phenomena comprised under this head are\r\ndue to the same causes. Suppose that in an exhausted bulb, under the\r\nmolecular impact, the surface of a piece of metal or other conductor\r\nis rendered strongly luminous, but at the same time it is found that\r\nit remains comparatively cool, would not this luminosity be called\r\nphosphorescence? Now such a result, theoretically at least, is\r\npossible, for it is a mere question of potential or speed. Assume the\r\npotential of the electrode, and consequently the speed of the\r\nprojected atoms, to be sufficiently high, the surface of the metal\r\npiece against which the atoms are projected would be rendered highly\r\nincandescent, since the process of heat generation would be\r\nincomparably faster than that of radiating or conducting away from the\r\nsurface of the collision. In the eye of the observer a single impact\r\nof the atoms would cause an instantaneous flash, but if the impacts\r\nwere repeated with sufficient rapidity they would produce a\r\ncontinuous impression upon his retina. To him then the surface of the\r\nmetal would appear continuously incandescent and of constant luminous\r\nintensity, while in reality the light would be either intermittent or\r\nat least changing periodically in intensity. The metal piece would\r\nrise in temperature until equilibrium was attained--that is until the\r\nenergy continuously radiated would equal that intermittently supplied.\r\nBut the supplied energy might under such conditions not be sufficient\r\nto bring the body to any more than a very moderate mean temperature,\r\nespecially if the frequency of the atomic impacts be very low--just\r\nenough that the fluctuation of the intensity of the light emitted\r\ncould not be detected by the eye. The body would now, owing to the\r\nmanner in which the energy is supplied, emit a strong light, and yet\r\nbe at a comparatively very low mean temperature. How could the\r\nobserver call the luminosity thus produced? Even if the analysis of\r\nthe light would teach him something definite, still he would probably\r\nrank it under the phenomena of phosphorescence. It is conceivable that\r\nin such a way both conducting and non-conducting bodies may be\r\nmaintained at a certain luminous intensity, but the energy required\r\nwould very greatly vary with the nature and properties of the bodies.\r\n\r\nThese and some foregoing remarks of a speculative nature were made\r\nmerely to bring out curious features of alternate currents or electric\r\nimpulses. By their help we may cause a body to emit _more_ light,\r\nwhile at a certain mean temperature, than it would emit if brought to\r\nthat temperature by a steady supply; and, again, we may bring a body\r\nto the point of fusion, and cause it to emit _less_ light than when\r\nfused by the application of energy in ordinary ways. It all depends on\r\nhow we supply the energy, and what kind of vibrations we set up: in\r\none case the vibrations are more, in the other less, adapted to affect\r\nour sense of vision.\r\n\r\nSome effects, which I had not observed before, obtained with\r\ncarborundum in the first trials, I attributed to phosphorescence, but\r\nin subsequent experiments it appeared that it was devoid of that\r\nquality. The crystals possess a noteworthy feature. In a bulb provided\r\nwith a single electrode in the shape of a small circular metal disc,\r\nfor instance, at a certain degree of exhaustion the electrode is\r\ncovered with a milky film, which is separated by a dark space from the\r\nglow filling the bulb. When the metal disc is covered with carborundum\r\ncrystals, the film is far more intense, and snow-white. This I found\r\nlater to be merely an effect of the bright surface of the crystals,\r\nfor when an aluminium electrode was highly polished it exhibited more\r\nor less the same phenomenon. I made a number of experiments with the\r\nsamples of crystals obtained, principally because it would have been\r\nof special interest to find that they are capable of phosphorescence,\r\non account of their being conducting. I could not produce\r\nphosphorescence distinctly, but I must remark that a decisive opinion\r\ncannot be formed until other experimenters have gone over the same\r\nground.\r\n\r\nThe powder behaved in some experiments as though it contained alumina,\r\nbut it did not exhibit with sufficient distinctness the red of the\r\nlatter. Its dead color brightens considerably under the molecular\r\nimpact, but I am now convinced it does not phosphoresce. Still, the\r\ntests with the powder are not conclusive, because powdered carborundum\r\nprobably does not behave like a phosphorescent sulphide, for example,\r\nwhich could be finely powdered without impairing the phosphorescence,\r\nbut rather like powdered ruby or diamond, and therefore it would be\r\nnecessary, in order to make a decisive test, to obtain it in a large\r\nlump and polish up the surface.\r\n\r\nIf the carborundum proves useful in connection with these and similar\r\nexperiments, its chief value will be found in the production of\r\ncoatings, thin conductors, buttons, or other electrodes capable of\r\nwithstanding extremely high degrees of heat.\r\n\r\nThe production of a small electrode capable of withstanding enormous\r\ntemperatures I regard as of the greatest importance in the manufacture\r\nof light. It would enable us to obtain, by means of currents of very\r\nhigh frequencies, certainly 20 times, if not more, the quantity of\r\nlight which is obtained in the present incandescent lamp by the same\r\nexpenditure of energy. This estimate may appear to many exaggerated,\r\nbut in reality I think it is far from being so. As this statement\r\nmight be misunderstood I think it necessary to expose clearly the\r\nproblem with which in this line of work we are confronted, and the\r\nmanner in which, in my opinion, a solution will be arrived at.\r\n\r\nAny one who begins a study of the problem will be apt to think that\r\nwhat is wanted in a lamp with an electrode is a very high degree of\r\nincandescence of the electrode. There he will be mistaken. The high\r\nincandescence of the button is a necessary evil, but what is really\r\nwanted is the high incandescence of the gas surrounding the button. In\r\nother words, the problem in such a lamp is to bring a mass of gas to\r\nthe highest possible incandescence. The higher the incandescence, the\r\nquicker the mean vibration, the greater is the economy of the light\r\nproduction. But to maintain a mass of gas at a high degree of\r\nincandescence in a glass vessel, it will always be necessary to keep\r\nthe incandescent mass away from the glass; that is, to confine it as\r\nmuch as possible to the central portion of the globe.\r\n\r\nIn one of the experiments this evening a brush was produced at the end\r\nof a wire. This brush was a flame, a source of heat and light. It did\r\nnot emit much perceptible heat, nor did it glow with an intense light;\r\nbut is it the less a flame because it does not scorch my hand? Is it\r\nthe less a flame because it does not hurt my eye by its brilliancy?\r\nThe problem is precisely to produce in the bulb such a flame, much\r\nsmaller in size, but incomparably more powerful. Were there means at\r\nhand for producing electric impulses of a sufficiently high frequency,\r\nand for transmitting them, the bulb could be done away with, unless it\r\nwere used to protect the electrode, or to economize the energy by\r\nconfining the heat. But as such means are not at disposal, it becomes\r\nnecessary to place the terminal in a bulb and rarefy the air in the\r\nsame. This is done merely to enable the apparatus to perform the work\r\nwhich it is not capable of performing at ordinary air pressure. In the\r\nbulb we are able to intensify the action to any degree--so far that\r\nthe brush emits a powerful light.\r\n\r\nThe intensity of the light emitted depends principally on the\r\nfrequency and potential of the impulses, and on the electric density\r\nof the surface of the electrode. It is of the greatest importance to\r\nemploy the smallest possible button, in order to push the density very\r\nfar. Under the violent impact of the molecules of the gas surrounding\r\nit, the small electrode is of course brought to an extremely high\r\ntemperature, but around it is a mass of highly incandescent gas, a\r\nflame photosphere, many hundred times the volume of the electrode.\r\nWith a diamond, carborundum or zirconia button the photosphere can be\r\nas much as one thousand times the volume of the button. Without much\r\nreflecting one would think that in pushing so far the incandescence of\r\nthe electrode it would be instantly volatilized. But after a careful\r\nconsideration he would find that, theoretically, it should not occur,\r\nand in this fact--which, however, is experimentally demonstrated--lies\r\nprincipally the future value of such a lamp.\r\n\r\nAt first, when the bombardment begins, most of the work is performed\r\non the surface of the button, but when a highly conducting photosphere\r\nis formed the button is comparatively relieved. The higher the\r\nincandescence of the photosphere the more it approaches in\r\nconductivity to that of the electrode, and the more, therefore, the\r\nsolid and the gas form one conducting body. The consequence is that\r\nthe further is forced the incandescence the more work, comparatively,\r\nis performed on the gas, and the less on the electrode. The formation\r\nof a powerful photosphere is consequently the very means for\r\nprotecting the electrode. This protection, of course, is a relative\r\none, and it should not be thought that by pushing the incandescence\r\nhigher the electrode is actually less deteriorated. Still,\r\ntheoretically, with extreme frequencies, this result must be reached,\r\nbut probably at a temperature too high for most of the refractory\r\nbodies known. Given, then, an electrode which can withstand to a very\r\nhigh limit the effect of the bombardment and outward strain, it would\r\nbe safe no matter how much it is forced beyond that limit. In an\r\nincandescent lamp quite different considerations apply. There the gas\r\nis not at all concerned: the whole of the work is performed on the\r\nfilament; and the life of the lamp diminishes so rapidly with the\r\nincrease of the degree of incandescence that economical reasons compel\r\nus to work it at a low incandescence. But if an incandescent lamp is\r\noperated with currents of very high frequency, the action of the gas\r\ncannot be neglected, and the rules for the most economical working\r\nmust be considerably modified.\r\n\r\nIn order to bring such a lamp with one or two electrodes to a great\r\nperfection, it is necessary to employ impulses of very high frequency.\r\nThe high frequency secures, among others, two chief advantages, which\r\nhave a most important bearing upon the economy of the light\r\nproduction. First, the deterioration of the electrode is reduced by\r\nreason of the fact that we employ a great many small impacts, instead\r\nof a few violent ones, which shatter quickly the structure; secondly,\r\nthe formation of a large photosphere is facilitated.\r\n\r\nIn order to reduce the deterioration of the electrode to the minimum,\r\nit is desirable that the vibration be harmonic, for any suddenness\r\nhastens the process of destruction. An electrode lasts much longer\r\nwhen kept at incandescence by currents, or impulses, obtained from a\r\nhigh-frequency alternator, which rise and fall more or less\r\nharmonically, than by impulses obtained from a disruptive discharge\r\ncoil. In the latter case there is no doubt that most of the damage is\r\ndone by the fundamental sudden discharges.\r\n\r\nOne of the elements of loss in such a lamp is the bombardment of the\r\nglobe. As the potential is very high, the molecules are projected with\r\ngreat speed; they strike the glass, and usually excite a strong\r\nphosphorescence. The effect produced is very pretty, but for\r\neconomical reasons it would be perhaps preferable to prevent, or at\r\nleast reduce to the minimum, the bombardment against the globe, as in\r\nsuch case it is, as a rule, not the object to excite phosphorescence,\r\nand as some loss of energy results from the bombardment. This loss in\r\nthe bulb is principally dependent on the potential of the impulses and\r\non the electric density on the surface of the electrode. In employing\r\nvery high frequencies the loss of energy by the bombardment is greatly\r\nreduced, for, first, the potential needed to perform a given amount of\r\nwork is much smaller; and, secondly, by producing a highly conducting\r\nphotosphere around the electrode, the same result is obtained as\r\nthough the electrode were much larger, which is equivalent to a\r\nsmaller electric density. But be it by the diminution of the maximum\r\npotential or of the density, the gain is effected in the same manner,\r\nnamely, by avoiding violent shocks, which strain the glass much beyond\r\nits limit of elasticity. If the frequency could be brought high\r\nenough, the loss due to the imperfect elasticity of the glass would be\r\nentirely negligible. The loss due to bombardment of the globe may,\r\nhowever, be reduced by using two electrodes instead of one. In such\r\ncase each of the electrodes may be connected to one of the terminals;\r\nor else, if it is preferable to use only one wire, one electrode may\r\nbe connected to one terminal and the other to the ground or to an\r\ninsulated body of some surface, as, for instance, a shade on the lamp.\r\nIn the latter case, unless some judgment is used, one of the\r\nelectrodes might glow more intensely than the other.\r\n\r\nBut on the whole I find it preferable when using such high frequencies\r\nto employ only one electrode and one connecting wire. I am convinced\r\nthat the illuminating device of the near future will not require for\r\nits operation more than one lead, and, at any rate, it will have no\r\nleading-in wire, since the energy required can be as well transmitted\r\nthrough the glass. In experimental bulbs the leading-in wire is most\r\ngenerally used on account of convenience, as in employing condenser\r\ncoatings in the manner indicated in Fig. 22, for example, there is\r\nsome difficulty in fitting the parts, but these difficulties would not\r\nexist if a great many bulbs were manufactured; otherwise the energy\r\ncan be conveyed through the glass as well as through a wire, and with\r\nthese high frequencies the losses are very small. Such illuminating\r\ndevices will necessarily involve the use of very high potentials, and\r\nthis, in the eyes of practical men, might be an objectionable feature.\r\nYet, in reality, high potentials are not objectionable--certainly not\r\nin the least as far as the safety of the devices is concerned.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways of rendering an electric appliance safe. One is to\r\nuse low potentials, the other is to determine the dimensions of the\r\napparatus so that it is safe no matter how high a potential is used.\r\nOf the two the latter seems to me the better way, for then the safety\r\nis absolute, unaffected by any possible combination of circumstances\r\nwhich might render even a low-potential appliance dangerous to life\r\nand property. But the practical conditions require not only the\r\njudicious determination of the dimensions of the apparatus; they\r\nlikewise necessitate the employment of energy of the proper kind. It\r\nis easy, for instance, to construct a transformer capable of giving,\r\nwhen operated from an ordinary alternate current machine of low\r\ntension, say 50,000 volts, which might be required to light a highly\r\nexhausted phosphorescent tube, so that, in spite of the high\r\npotential, it is perfectly safe, the shock from it producing no\r\ninconvenience. Still, such a transformer would be expensive, and in\r\nitself inefficient; and, besides, what energy was obtained from it\r\nwould not be economically used for the production of light. The\r\neconomy demands the employment of energy in the form of extremely\r\nrapid vibrations. The problem of producing light has been likened to\r\nthat of maintaining a certain high-pitch note by means of a bell. It\r\nshould be said a _barely audible_ note; and even these words would not\r\nexpress it, so wonderful is the sensitiveness of the eye. We may\r\ndeliver powerful blows at long intervals, waste a good deal of energy,\r\nand still not get what we want; or we may keep up the note by\r\ndelivering frequent gentle taps, and get nearer to the object sought\r\nby the expenditure of much less energy. In the production of light, as\r\nfar as the illuminating device is concerned, there can be only one\r\nrule--that is, to use as high frequencies as can be obtained; but the\r\nmeans for the production and conveyance of impulses of such character\r\nimpose, at present at least, great limitations. Once it is decided to\r\nuse very high frequencies, the return wire becomes unnecessary, and\r\nall the appliances are simplified. By the use of obvious means the\r\nsame result is obtained as though the return wire were used. It is\r\nsufficient for this purpose to bring in contact with the bulb, or\r\nmerely in the vicinity of the same, an insulated body of some surface.\r\nThe surface need, of course, be the smaller, the higher the frequency\r\nand potential used, and necessarily, also, the higher the economy of\r\nthe lamp or other device.\r\n\r\nThis plan of working has been resorted to on several occasions this\r\nevening. So, for instance, when the incandescence of a button was\r\nproduced by grasping the bulb with the hand, the body of the\r\nexperimenter merely served to intensify the action. The bulb used was\r\nsimilar to that illustrated in Fig. 19, and the coil was excited to a\r\nsmall potential, not sufficient to bring the button to incandescence\r\nwhen the bulb was hanging from the wire; and incidentally, in order to\r\nperform the experiment in a more suitable manner, the button was taken\r\nso large that a perceptible time had to elapse before, upon grasping\r\nthe bulb, it could be rendered incandescent. The contact with the bulb\r\nwas, of course, quite unnecessary. It is easy, by using a rather large\r\nbulb with an exceedingly small electrode, to adjust the conditions so\r\nthat the latter is brought to bright incandescence by the mere\r\napproach of the experimenter within a few feet of the bulb, and that\r\nthe incandescence subsides upon his receding.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.--BULB WITHOUT LEADING-IN WIRE, SHOWING EFFECT\r\nOF PROJECTED MATTER.]\r\n\r\nIn another experiment, when phosphorescence was excited, a similar\r\nbulb was used. Here again, originally, the potential was not\r\nsufficient to excite phosphorescence until the action was\r\nintensified--in this case, however, to present a different feature, by\r\ntouching the socket with a metallic object held in the hand. The\r\nelectrode in the bulb was a carbon button so large that it could not\r\nbe brought to incandescence, and thereby spoil the effect produced by\r\nphosphorescence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.--IMPROVED EXPERIMENTAL BULB.]\r\n\r\nAgain, in another of the early experiments, a bulb was used as\r\nillustrated in Fig. 12. In this instance, by touching the bulb with\r\none or two fingers, one or two shadows of the stem inside were\r\nprojected against the glass, the touch of the finger producing the\r\nsame result as the application of an external negative electrode under\r\nordinary circumstances.\r\n\r\nIn all these experiments the action was intensified by augmenting the\r\ncapacity at the end of the lead connected to the terminal. As a rule,\r\nit is not necessary to resort to such means, and would be quite\r\nunnecessary with still higher frequencies; but when it _is_ desired,\r\nthe bulb, or tube, can be easily adapted to the purpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.--IMPROVED BULB WITH INTENSIFYING REFLECTOR.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 24, for example, an experimental bulb L is shown, which is\r\nprovided with a neck n on the top for the application of an external\r\ntinfoil coating, which may be connected to a body of larger surface.\r\nSuch a lamp as illustrated in Fig. 25 may also be lighted by\r\nconnecting the tinfoil coating on the neck n to the terminal, and the\r\nleading-in wire w to an insulated plate. If the bulb stands in a\r\nsocket upright, as shown in the cut, a shade of conducting material\r\nmay be slipped in the neck n, and the action thus magnified.\r\n\r\nA more perfected arrangement used in some of these bulbs is\r\nillustrated in Fig. 26. In this case the construction of the bulb is\r\nas shown and described before, when reference was made to Fig. 19. A\r\nzinc sheet Z, with a tubular extension T, is slipped over the metallic\r\nsocket S. The bulb hangs downward from the terminal t, the zinc sheet\r\nZ, performing the double office of intensifier and reflector. The\r\nreflector is separated from the terminal t by an extension of the\r\ninsulating plug P.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.--PHOSPHORESCENT TUBE WITH INTENSIFYING\r\nREFLECTOR.]\r\n\r\nA similar disposition with a phosphorescent tube is illustrated in\r\nFig. 27. The tube T is prepared from two short tubes of a different\r\ndiameter, which are sealed on the ends. On the lower end is placed an\r\noutside conducting coating C, which connects to the wire w. The wire\r\nhas a hook on the upper end for suspension, and passes through the\r\ncentre of the inside tube, which is filled with some good and tightly\r\npacked insulator. On the outside of the upper end of the tube T is\r\nanother conducting coating C_1 upon which is slipped a metallic\r\nreflector Z, which should be separated by a thick insulation from the\r\nend of wire w.\r\n\r\nThe economical use of such a reflector or intensifier would require\r\nthat all energy supplied to an air condenser should be recoverable,\r\nor, in other words, that there should not be any losses, neither in\r\nthe gaseous medium nor through its action elsewhere. This is far from\r\nbeing so, but, fortunately, the losses may be reduced to anything\r\ndesired. A few remarks are necessary on this subject, in order to make\r\nthe experiences gathered in the course of these investigations\r\nperfectly clear.\r\n\r\nSuppose a small helix with many well insulated turns, as in experiment\r\nFig. 17, has one of its ends connected to one of the terminals of the\r\ninduction coil, and the other to a metal plate, or, for the sake of\r\nsimplicity, a sphere, insulated in space. When the coil is set to\r\nwork, the potential of the sphere is alternated, and the small helix\r\nnow behaves as though its free end were connected to the other\r\nterminal of the induction coil. If an iron rod be held within the\r\nsmall helix it is quickly brought to a high temperature, indicating\r\nthe passage of a strong current through the helix. How does the\r\ninsulated sphere act in this case? It can be a condenser, storing and\r\nreturning the energy supplied to it, or it can be a mere sink of\r\nenergy, and the conditions of the experiment determine whether it is\r\nmore one or the other. The sphere being charged to a high potential,\r\nit acts inductively upon the surrounding air, or whatever gaseous\r\nmedium there might be. The molecules, or atoms, which are near the\r\nsphere are of course more attracted, and move through a greater\r\ndistance than the farther ones. When the nearest molecules strike the\r\nsphere they are repelled, and collisions occur at all distances within\r\nthe inductive action of the sphere. It is now clear that, if the\r\npotential be steady, but little loss of energy can be caused in this\r\nway, for the molecules which are nearest to the sphere, having had an\r\nadditional charge imparted to them by contact, are not attracted until\r\nthey have parted, if not with all, at least with most of the\r\nadditional charge, which can be accomplished only after a great many\r\ncollisions. From the fact that with a steady potential there is but\r\nlittle loss in dry air, one must come to such a conclusion. When the\r\npotential of the sphere, instead of being steady, is alternating, the\r\nconditions are entirely different. In this case a rhythmical\r\nbombardment occurs, no matter whether the molecules after coming in\r\ncontact with the sphere lose the imparted charge or not; what is more,\r\nif the charge is not lost, the impacts are only the more violent.\r\nStill if the frequency of the impulses be very small, the loss caused\r\nby the impacts and collisions would not be serious unless the\r\npotential were excessive. But when extremely high frequencies and more\r\nor less high potentials are used, the loss may be very great. The\r\ntotal energy lost per unit of time is proportionate to the product of\r\nthe number of impacts per second, or the frequency and the energy lost\r\nin each impact. But the energy of an impact must be proportionate to\r\nthe square of the electric density of the sphere, since the charge\r\nimparted to the molecule is proportionate to that density. I conclude\r\nfrom this that the total energy lost must be proportionate to the\r\nproduct of the frequency and the square of the electric density; but\r\nthis law needs experimental confirmation. Assuming the preceding\r\nconsiderations to be true, then, by rapidly alternating the potential\r\nof a body immersed in an insulating gaseous medium, any amount of\r\nenergy may be dissipated into space. Most of that energy then, I\r\nbelieve, is not dissipated in the form of long ether waves, propagated\r\nto considerable distance, as is thought most generally, but is\r\nconsumed--in the case of an insulated sphere, for example--in impact\r\nand collisional losses--that is, heat vibrations--on the surface and\r\nin the vicinity of the sphere. To reduce the dissipation it is\r\nnecessary to work with a small electric density--the smaller the\r\nhigher the frequency.\r\n\r\nBut since, on the assumption before made, the loss is diminished with\r\nthe square of the density, and since currents of very high frequencies\r\ninvolve considerable waste when transmitted through conductors, it\r\nfollows that, on the whole, it is better to employ one wire than two.\r\nTherefore, if motors, lamps, or devices of any kind are perfected,\r\ncapable of being advantageously operated by currents of extremely high\r\nfrequency, economical reasons will make it advisable to use only one\r\nwire, especially if the distances are great.\r\n\r\nWhen energy is absorbed in a condenser the same behaves as though its\r\ncapacity were increased. Absorption always exists more or less, but\r\ngenerally it is small and of no consequence as long as the frequencies\r\nare not very great. In using extremely high frequencies, and,\r\nnecessarily in such case, also high potentials, the absorption--or,\r\nwhat is here meant more particularly by this term, the loss of energy\r\ndue to the presence of a gaseous medium--is an important factor to be\r\nconsidered, as the energy absorbed in the air condenser may be any\r\nfraction of the supplied energy. This would seem to make it very\r\ndifficult to tell from the measured or computed capacity of an air\r\ncondenser its actual capacity or vibration period, especially if the\r\ncondenser is of very small surface and is charged to a very high\r\npotential. As many important results are dependent upon the\r\ncorrectness of the estimation of the vibration period, this subject\r\ndemands the most careful scrutiny of other investigators. To reduce\r\nthe probable error as much as possible in experiments of the kind\r\nalluded to, it is advisable to use spheres or plates of large surface,\r\nso as to make the density exceedingly small. Otherwise, when it is\r\npracticable, an oil condenser should be used in preference. In oil or\r\nother liquid dielectrics there are seemingly no such losses as in\r\ngaseous media. It being impossible to exclude entirely the gas in\r\ncondensers with solid dielectrics, such condensers should be immersed\r\nin oil, for economical reasons if nothing else; they can then be\r\nstrained to the utmost and will remain cool. In Leyden jars the loss\r\ndue to air is comparatively small, as the tinfoil coatings are large,\r\nclose together, and the charged surfaces not directly exposed; but\r\nwhen the potentials are very high, the loss may be more or less\r\nconsiderable at, or near, the upper edge of the foil, where the air is\r\nprincipally acted upon. If the jar be immersed in boiled-out oil, it\r\nwill be capable of performing four times the amount of work which it\r\ncan for any length of time when used in the ordinary way, and the loss\r\nwill be inappreciable.\r\n\r\nIt should not be thought that the loss in heat in an air condenser is\r\nnecessarily associated with the formation of _visible_ streams or\r\nbrushes. If a small electrode, inclosed in an unexhausted bulb, is\r\nconnected to one of the terminals of the coil, streams can be seen to\r\nissue from the electrode and the air in the bulb is heated; if,\r\ninstead of a small electrode, a large sphere is inclosed in the bulb,\r\nno streams are observed, still the air is heated.\r\n\r\nNor should it be thought that the temperature of an air condenser\r\nwould give even an approximate idea of the loss in heat incurred, as\r\nin such case heat must be given off much more quickly, since there is,\r\nin addition to the ordinary radiation, a very active carrying away of\r\nheat by independent carriers going on, and since not only the\r\napparatus, but the air at some distance from it is heated in\r\nconsequence of the collisions which must occur.\r\n\r\nOwing to this, in experiments with such a coil, a rise of temperature\r\ncan be distinctly observed only when the body connected to the coil is\r\nvery small. But with apparatus on a larger scale, even a body of\r\nconsiderable bulk would be heated, as, for instance, the body of a\r\nperson; and I think that skilled physicians might make observations of\r\nutility in such experiments, which, if the apparatus were judiciously\r\ndesigned, would not present the slightest danger.\r\n\r\nA question of some interest, principally to meteorologists, presents\r\nitself here. How does the earth behave? The earth is an air condenser,\r\nbut is it a perfect or a very imperfect one--a mere sink of energy?\r\nThere can be little doubt that to such small disturbance as might be\r\ncaused in an experiment the earth behaves as an almost perfect\r\ncondenser. But it might be different when its charge is set in\r\nvibration by some sudden disturbance occurring in the heavens. In such\r\ncase, as before stated, probably only little of the energy of the\r\nvibrations set up would be lost into space in the form of long ether\r\nradiations, but most of the energy, I think, would spend itself in\r\nmolecular impacts and collisions, and pass off into space in the form\r\nof short heat, and possibly light, waves. As both the frequency of the\r\nvibrations of the charge and the potential are in all probability\r\nexcessive, the energy converted into heat may be considerable. Since\r\nthe density must be unevenly distributed, either in consequence of the\r\nirregularity of the earth's surface, or on account of the condition of\r\nthe atmosphere in various places, the effect produced would\r\naccordingly vary from place to place. Considerable variations in the\r\ntemperature and pressure of the atmosphere may in this manner be\r\ncaused at any point of the surface of the earth. The variations may be\r\ngradual or very sudden, according to the nature of the general\r\ndisturbance, and may produce rain and storms, or locally modify the\r\nweather in any way.\r\n\r\nFrom the remarks before made one may see what an important factor of\r\nloss the air in the neighborhood of a charged surface becomes when the\r\nelectric density is great and the frequency of the impulses excessive.\r\nBut the action as explained implies that the air is insulating--that\r\nis, that it is composed of independent carriers immersed in an\r\ninsulating medium. This is the case only when the air is at something\r\nlike ordinary or greater, or at extremely small, pressure. When the\r\nair is slightly rarefied and conducting, then true conduction losses\r\noccur also. In such case, of course, considerable energy may be\r\ndissipated into space even with a steady potential, or with impulses\r\nof low frequency, if the density is very great.\r\n\r\nWhen the gas is at very low pressure, an electrode is heated more\r\nbecause higher speeds can be reached. If the gas around the electrode\r\nis strongly compressed, the displacements, and consequently the\r\nspeeds, are very small, and the heating is insignificant. But if in\r\nsuch case the frequency could be sufficiently increased, the electrode\r\nwould be brought to a high temperature as well as if the gas were at\r\nvery low pressure; in fact, exhausting the bulb is only necessary\r\nbecause we cannot produce (and possibly not convey) currents of the\r\nrequired frequency.\r\n\r\nReturning to the subject of electrode lamps, it is obviously of\r\nadvantage in such a lamp to confine as much as possible the heat to\r\nthe electrode by preventing the circulation of the gas in the bulb. If\r\na very small bulb be taken, it would confine the heat better than a\r\nlarge one, but it might not be of sufficient capacity to be operated\r\nfrom the coil, or, if so, the glass might get too hot. A simple way to\r\nimprove in this direction is to employ a globe of the required size,\r\nbut to place a small bulb, the diameter of which is properly\r\nestimated, over the refractory button contained in the globe. This\r\narrangement is illustrated in Fig. 28.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.--LAMP WITH AUXILIARY BULB FOR CONFINING THE\r\nACTION TO THE CENTRE.]\r\n\r\nThe globe L has in this case a large neck n, allowing the small bulb b\r\nto slip through. Otherwise the construction is the same as shown in\r\nFig. 18, for example. The small bulb is conveniently supported upon\r\nthe stem s, carrying the refractory button m. It is separated from the\r\naluminium tube a by several layers of mica M, in order to prevent the\r\ncracking of the neck by the rapid heating of the aluminium tube upon a\r\nsudden turning on of the current. The inside bulb should be as small\r\nas possible when it is desired to obtain light only by incandescence\r\nof the electrode. If it is desired to produce phosphorescence, the\r\nbulb should be larger, else it would be apt to get too hot, and the\r\nphosphorescence would cease. In this arrangement usually only the\r\nsmall bulb shows phosphorescence, as there is practically no\r\nbombardment against the outer globe. In some of these bulbs\r\nconstructed as illustrated in Fig. 28 the small tube was coated with\r\nphosphorescent paint, and beautiful effects were obtained. Instead of\r\nmaking the inside bulb large, in order to avoid undue heating, it\r\nanswers the purpose to make the electrode m larger. In this case the\r\nbombardment is weakened by reason of the smaller electric density.\r\n\r\nMany bulbs were constructed on the plan illustrated in Fig. 29. Here a\r\nsmall bulb b, containing the refractory button m, upon being exhausted\r\nto a very high degree was sealed in a large globe L, which was then\r\nmoderately exhausted and sealed off. The principal advantage of this\r\nconstruction was that it allowed of reaching extremely high vacua,\r\nand, at the same time use a large bulb. It was found, in the course of\r\nexperiences with bulbs such as illustrated in Fig. 29, that it was\r\nwell to make the stem s near the seal at e very thick, and the\r\nleading-in wire w thin, as it occurred sometimes that the stem at e\r\nwas heated and the bulb was cracked. Often the outer globe L was\r\nexhausted only just enough to allow the discharge to pass through, and\r\nthe space between the bulbs appeared crimson, producing a curious\r\neffect. In some cases, when the exhaustion in globe L was very low,\r\nand the air good conducting, it was found necessary, in order to bring\r\nthe button m to high incandescence, to place, preferably on the upper\r\npart of the neck of the globe, a tinfoil coating which was connected\r\nto an insulated body, to the ground, or to the other terminal of the\r\ncoil, as the highly conducting air weakened the effect somewhat,\r\nprobably by being acted upon inductively from the wire w, where it\r\nentered the bulb at e. Another difficulty--which, however, is always\r\npresent when the refractory button is mounted in a very small\r\nbulb--existed in the construction illustrated in Fig. 29, namely, the\r\nvacuum in the bulb b would be impaired in a comparatively short time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.--LAMP WITH INDEPENDENT AUXILIARY BULB.]\r\n\r\nThe chief idea in the two last described constructions was to confine\r\nthe heat to the central portion of the globe by preventing the\r\nexchange of air. An advantage is secured, but owing to the heating of\r\nthe inside bulb and slow evaporation of the glass the vacuum is hard\r\nto maintain, even if the construction illustrated in Fig. 28 be\r\nchosen, in which both bulbs communicate.\r\n\r\nBut by far the better way--the ideal way--would be to reach\r\nsufficiently high frequencies. The higher the frequency the slower\r\nwould be the exchange of the air, and I think that a frequency may be\r\nreached at which there would be no exchange whatever of the air\r\nmolecules around the terminal. We would then produce a flame in which\r\nthere would be no carrying away of material, and a queer flame it\r\nwould be, for it would be rigid! With such high frequencies the\r\ninertia of the particles would come into play. As the brush, or flame,\r\nwould gain rigidity in virtue of the inertia of the particles, the\r\nexchange of the latter would be prevented. This would necessarily\r\noccur, for, the number of the impulses being augmented, the potential\r\nenergy of each would diminish, so that finally only atomic vibrations\r\ncould be set up, and the motion of translation through measurable\r\nspace would cease. Thus an ordinary gas burner connected to a source\r\nof rapidly alternating potential might have its efficiency augmented\r\nto a certain limit, and this for two reasons--because of the\r\nadditional vibration imparted, and because of a slowing down of the\r\nprocess of carrying off. But the renewal being rendered difficult, and\r\nrenewal being necessary to maintain the _burner_, a continued increase\r\nof the frequency of the impulses, assuming they could be transmitted\r\nto and impressed upon the flame, would result in the \"extinction\" of\r\nthe latter, meaning by this term only the cessation of the chemical\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nI think, however, that in the case of an electrode immersed in a fluid\r\ninsulating medium, and surrounded by independent carriers of electric\r\ncharges, which can be acted upon inductively, a sufficiently high\r\nfrequency of the impulses would probably result in a gravitation of\r\nthe gas all around toward the electrode. For this it would be only\r\nnecessary to assume that the independent bodies are irregularly\r\nshaped; they would then turn toward the electrode their side of the\r\ngreatest electric density, and this would be a position in which the\r\nfluid resistance to approach would be smaller than that offered to the\r\nreceding.\r\n\r\nThe general opinion, I do not doubt, is that it is out of the question\r\nto reach any such frequencies as might--assuming some of the views\r\nbefore expressed to be true--produce any of the results which I have\r\npointed out as mere possibilities. This may be so, but in the course\r\nof these investigations, from the observation of many phenomena I have\r\ngained the conviction that these frequencies would be much lower than\r\none is apt to estimate at first. In a flame we set up light vibrations\r\nby causing molecules, or atoms, to collide. But what is the ratio of\r\nthe frequency of the collisions and that of the vibrations set up?\r\nCertainly it must be incomparably smaller than that of the knocks of\r\nthe bell and the sound vibrations, or that of the discharges and the\r\noscillations of the condenser. We may cause the molecules of the gas\r\nto collide by the use of alternate electric impulses of high\r\nfrequency, and so we may imitate the process in a flame; and from\r\nexperiments with frequencies which we are now able to obtain, I think\r\nthat the result is producible with impulses which are transmissible\r\nthrough a conductor.\r\n\r\nIn connection with thoughts of a similar nature, it appeared to me of\r\ngreat interest to demonstrate the rigidity of a vibrating gaseous\r\ncolumn. Although with such low frequencies as, say 10,000 per second,\r\nwhich I was able to obtain without difficulty from a specially\r\nconstructed alternator, the task looked discouraging at first, I made\r\na series of experiments. The trials with air at ordinary pressure led\r\nto no result, but with air moderately rarefied I obtain what I think\r\nto be an unmistakable experimental evidence of the property sought\r\nfor. As a result of this kind might lead able investigators to\r\nconclusions of importance I will describe one of the experiments\r\nperformed.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that when a tube is slightly exhausted the discharge\r\nmay be passed through it in the form of a thin luminous thread. When\r\nproduced with currents of low frequency, obtained from a coil operated\r\nas usual, this thread is inert. If a magnet be approached to it, the\r\npart near the same is attracted or repelled, according to the\r\ndirection of the lines of force of the magnet. It occurred to me that\r\nif such a thread would be produced with currents of very high\r\nfrequency, it should be more or less rigid, and as it was visible it\r\ncould be easily studied. Accordingly I prepared a tube about 1 inch in\r\ndiameter and 1 metre long, with outside coating at each end. The tube\r\nwas exhausted to a point at which by a little working the thread\r\ndischarge could be obtained. It must be remarked here that the general\r\naspect of the tube, and the degree of exhaustion, are quite different\r\nthan when ordinary low frequency currents are used. As it was found\r\npreferable to work with one terminal, the tube prepared was suspended\r\nfrom the end of a wire connected to the terminal, the tinfoil coating\r\nbeing connected to the wire, and to the lower coating sometimes a\r\nsmall insulated plate was attached. When the thread was formed it\r\nextended through the upper part of the tube and lost itself in the\r\nlower end. If it possessed rigidity it resembled, not exactly an\r\nelastic cord stretched tight between two supports, but a cord\r\nsuspended from a height with a small weight attached at the end. When\r\nthe finger or a magnet was approached to the upper end of the luminous\r\nthread, it could be brought locally out of position by electrostatic\r\nor magnetic action; and when the disturbing object was very quickly\r\nremoved, an analogous result was produced, as though a suspended cord\r\nwould be displaced and quickly released near the point of suspension.\r\nIn doing this the luminous thread was set in vibration, and two very\r\nsharply marked nodes, and a third indistinct one, were formed. The\r\nvibration, once set up, continued for fully eight minutes, dying\r\ngradually out. The speed of the vibration often varied perceptibly,\r\nand it could be observed that the electrostatic attraction of the\r\nglass affected the vibrating thread; but it was clear that the\r\nelectrostatic action was not the cause of the vibration, for the\r\nthread was most generally stationary, and could always be set in\r\nvibration by passing the finger quickly near the upper part of the\r\ntube. With a magnet the thread could be split in two and both parts\r\nvibrated. By approaching the hand to the lower coating of the tube, or\r\ninsulated plate if attached, the vibration was quickened; also, as far\r\nas I could see, by raising the potential or frequency. Thus, either\r\nincreasing the frequency or passing a stronger discharge of the same\r\nfrequency corresponded to a tightening of the cord. I did not obtain\r\nany experimental evidence with condenser discharges. A luminous band\r\nexcited in a bulb by repeated discharges of a Leyden jar must possess\r\nrigidity, and if deformed and suddenly released should vibrate. But\r\nprobably the amount of vibrating matter is so small that in spite of\r\nthe extreme speed the inertia cannot prominently assert itself.\r\nBesides, the observation in such a case is rendered extremely\r\ndifficult on account of the fundamental vibration.\r\n\r\nThe demonstration of the fact--which still needs better experimental\r\nconfirmation--that a vibrating gaseous column possesses rigidity,\r\nmight greatly modify the views of thinkers. When with low frequencies\r\nand insignificant potentials indications of that property may be\r\nnoted, how must a gaseous medium behave under the influence of\r\nenormous electrostatic stresses which may be active in the\r\ninterstellar space, and which may alternate with inconceivable\r\nrapidity? The existence of such an electrostatic, rhythmically\r\nthrobbing force--of a vibrating electrostatic field--would show a\r\npossible way how solids might have formed from the ultra-gaseous\r\nuterus, and how transverse and all kinds of vibrations may be\r\ntransmitted through a gaseous medium filling all space. Then, ether\r\nmight be a true fluid, devoid of rigidity, and at rest, it being\r\nmerely necessary as a connecting link to enable interaction. What\r\ndetermines the rigidity of a body? It must be the speed and the amount\r\nof moving matter. In a gas the speed may be considerable, but the\r\ndensity is exceedingly small; in a liquid the speed would be likely to\r\nbe small, though the density may be considerable; and in both cases\r\nthe inertia resistance offered to displacement is practically _nil_.\r\nBut place a gaseous (or liquid) column in an intense, rapidly\r\nalternating electrostatic field, set the particles vibrating with\r\nenormous speeds, then the inertia resistance asserts itself. A body\r\nmight move with more or less freedom through the vibrating mass, but\r\nas a whole it would be rigid.\r\n\r\nThere is a subject which I must mention in connection with these\r\nexperiments: it is that of high vacua. This is a subject the study of\r\nwhich is not only interesting, but useful, for it may lead to results\r\nof great practical importance. In commercial apparatus, such as\r\nincandescent lamps, operated from ordinary systems of distribution, a\r\nmuch higher vacuum than obtained at present would not secure a very\r\ngreat advantage. In such a case the work is performed on the filament\r\nand the gas is little concerned; the improvement, therefore, would be\r\nbut trifling. But when we begin to use very high frequencies and\r\npotentials, the action of the gas becomes all important, and the\r\ndegree of exhaustion materially modifies the results. As long as\r\nordinary coils, even very large ones, were used, the study of the\r\nsubject was limited, because just at a point when it became most\r\ninteresting it had to be interrupted on account of the \"non-striking\"\r\nvacuum being reached. But presently we are able to obtain from a small\r\ndisruptive discharge coil potentials much higher than even the largest\r\ncoil was capable of giving, and, what is more, we can make the\r\npotential alternate with great rapidity. Both of these results enable\r\nus now to pass a luminous discharge through almost any vacua\r\nobtainable, and the field of our investigations is greatly extended.\r\nThink we as we may, of all the possible directions to develop a\r\npractical illuminant, the line of high vacua seems to be the most\r\npromising at present. But to reach extreme vacua the appliances must\r\nbe much more improved, and ultimate perfection will not be attained\r\nuntil we shall have discarded the mechanical and perfected an\r\n_electrical_ vacuum pump. Molecules and atoms can be thrown out of a\r\nbulb under the action of an enormous potential: _this_ will be the\r\nprinciple of the vacuum pump of the future. For the present, we must\r\nsecure the best results we can with mechanical appliances. In this\r\nrespect, it might not be out of the way to say a few words about the\r\nmethod of, and apparatus for, producing excessively high degrees of\r\nexhaustion of which I have availed myself in the course of these\r\ninvestigations. It is very probable that other experimenters have used\r\nsimilar arrangements; but as it is possible that there may be an item\r\nof interest in their description, a few remarks, which will render\r\nthis investigation more complete, might be permitted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.--APPARATUS USED FOR OBTAINING HIGH DEGREES OF\r\nEXHAUSTION.]\r\n\r\nThe apparatus is illustrated in a drawing shown in Fig. 30. S\r\nrepresents a Sprengel pump, which has been specially constructed to\r\nbetter suit the work required. The stop-cock which is usually employed\r\nhas been omitted, and instead of it a hollow stopper s has been fitted\r\nin the neck of the reservoir R. This stopper has a small hole h,\r\nthrough which the mercury descends; the size of the outlet o being\r\nproperly determined with respect to the section of the fall tube t,\r\nwhich is sealed to the reservoir instead of being connected to it in\r\nthe usual manner. This arrangement overcomes the imperfections and\r\ntroubles which often arise from the use of the stopcock on the\r\nreservoir and the connection of the latter with the fall tube.\r\n\r\nThe pump is connected through a U-shaped tube t to a very large\r\nreservoir R_1. Especial care was taken in fitting the grinding\r\nsurfaces of the stoppers p and p_1, and both of these and the mercury\r\ncaps above them were made exceptionally long. After the U-shaped tube\r\nwas fitted and put in place, it was heated, so as to soften and take\r\noff the strain resulting from imperfect fitting. The U-shaped tube was\r\nprovided with a stopcock C, and two ground connections g and g_1--one\r\nfor a small bulb b, usually containing caustic potash, and the other\r\nfor the receiver r, to be exhausted.\r\n\r\nThe reservoir R_1 was connected by means of a rubber tube to a\r\nslightly larger reservoir R_2, each of the two reservoirs being\r\nprovided with a stopcock C_1 and C_2, respectively. The reservoir R_2\r\ncould be raised and lowered by a wheel and rack, and the range of its\r\nmotion was so determined that when it was filled with mercury and the\r\nstopcock C_2 closed, so as to form a Torricellian vacuum in it when\r\nraised, it could be lifted so high that the mercury in reservoir R_1\r\nwould stand a little above stopcock C_1; and when this stopcock was\r\nclosed and the reservoir R_2 descended, so as to form a Torricellian\r\nvacuum in reservoir R_1, it could be lowered so far as to completely\r\nempty the latter, the mercury filling the reservoir R_2 up to a little\r\nabove stopcock C_2.\r\n\r\nThe capacity of the pump and of the connections was taken as small as\r\npossible relatively to the volume of reservoir R_1, since, of course,\r\nthe degree of exhaustion depended upon the ratio of these quantities.\r\n\r\nWith this apparatus I combined the usual means indicated by former\r\nexperiments for the production of very high vacua. In most of the\r\nexperiments it was convenient to use caustic potash. I may venture to\r\nsay, in regard to its use, that much time is saved and a more perfect\r\naction of the pump insured by fusing and boiling the potash as soon\r\nas, or even before, the pump settles down. If this course is not\r\nfollowed the sticks, as ordinarily employed, may give moisture off at\r\na certain very slow rate, and the pump may work for many hours without\r\nreaching a very high vacuum. The potash was heated either by a spirit\r\nlamp or by passing a discharge through it, or by passing a current\r\nthrough a wire contained in it. The advantage in the latter case was\r\nthat the heating could be more rapidly repeated.\r\n\r\nGenerally the process of exhaustion was the following:--At the start,\r\nthe stop-cocks C and C_1 being open, and all other connections closed,\r\nthe reservoir R_2 was raised so far that the mercury filled the\r\nreservoir R_1 and a part of the narrow connecting U-shaped tube. When\r\nthe pump was set to work, the mercury would, of course, quickly rise\r\nin the tube, and reservoir R_2 was lowered, the experimenter keeping\r\nthe mercury at about the same level. The reservoir R_2 was balanced\r\nby a long spring which facilitated the operation, and the friction of\r\nthe parts was generally sufficient to keep it almost in any position.\r\nWhen the Sprengel pump had done its work, the reservoir R_2 was\r\nfurther lowered and the mercury descended in R_1 and filled R_2,\r\nwhereupon stopcock C_2 was closed. The air adhering to the walls of\r\nR_1 and that absorbed by the mercury was carried off, and to free the\r\nmercury of all air the reservoir R_2 was for a long time worked up and\r\ndown. During this process some air, which would gather below stopcock\r\nC_2, was expelled from R_2 by lowering it far enough and opening the\r\nstopcock, closing the latter again before raising the reservoir. When\r\nall the air had been expelled from the mercury, and no air would\r\ngather in R_2 when it was lowered, the caustic potash was resorted to.\r\nThe reservoir R_2 was now again raised until the mercury in R_1 stood\r\nabove stopcock C_1. The caustic potash was fused and boiled, and the\r\nmoisture partly carried off by the pump and partly re-absorbed; and\r\nthis process of heating and cooling was repeated many times, and each\r\ntime, upon the moisture being absorbed or carried off, the reservoir\r\nR_2 was for a long time raised and lowered. In this manner all the\r\nmoisture was carried off from the mercury, and both the reservoirs\r\nwere in proper condition to be used. The reservoir R_2 was then again\r\nraised to the top, and the pump was kept working for a long time. When\r\nthe highest vacuum obtainable with the pump had been reached the\r\npotash bulb was usually wrapped with cotton which was sprinkled with\r\nether so as to keep the potash at a very low temperature, then the\r\nreservoir R_2 was lowered, and upon reservoir R_1 being emptied the\r\nreceiver r was quickly sealed up.\r\n\r\nWhen a new bulb was put on, the mercury was always raised above\r\nstopcock C_1 which was closed, so as to always keep the mercury and\r\nboth the reservoirs in fine condition, and the mercury was never\r\nwithdrawn from R_1 except when the pump had reached the highest degree\r\nof exhaustion. It is necessary to observe this rule if it is desired\r\nto use the apparatus to advantage.\r\n\r\nBy means of this arrangement I was able to proceed very quickly, and\r\nwhen the apparatus was in perfect order it was possible to reach the\r\nphosphorescent stage in a small bulb in less than 15 minutes, which is\r\ncertainly very quick work for a small laboratory arrangement requiring\r\nall in all about 100 pounds of mercury. With ordinary small bulbs the\r\nratio of the capacity of the pump, receiver, and connections, and that\r\nof reservoir R was about 1-20, and the degrees of exhaustion reached\r\nwere necessarily very high, though I am unable to make a precise and\r\nreliable statement how far the exhaustion was carried.\r\n\r\nWhat impresses the investigator most in the course of these\r\nexperiences is the behavior of gases when subjected to great rapidly\r\nalternating electrostatic stresses. But he must remain in doubt as to\r\nwhether the effects observed are due wholly to the molecules, or\r\natoms, of the gas which chemical analysis discloses to us, or whether\r\nthere enters into play another medium of a gaseous nature, comprising\r\natoms, or molecules, immersed in a fluid pervading the space. Such a\r\nmedium surely must exist, and I am convinced that, for instance, even\r\nif air were absent, the surface and neighborhood of a body in space\r\nwould be heated by rapidly alternating the potential of the body; but\r\nno such heating of the surface or neighborhood could occur if all free\r\natoms were removed and only a homogeneous, incompressible, and elastic\r\nfluid--such as ether is supposed to be--would remain, for then there\r\nwould be no impacts, no collisions. In such a case, as far as the body\r\nitself is concerned, only frictional losses in the inside could occur.\r\n\r\nIt is a striking fact that the discharge through a gas is established\r\nwith ever increasing freedom as the frequency of the impulses is\r\naugmented. It behaves in this respect quite contrarily to a metallic\r\nconductor. In the latter the impedance enters prominently into play as\r\nthe frequency is increased, but the gas acts much as a series of\r\ncondensers would: the facility with which the discharge passes through\r\nseems to depend on the rate of change of potential. If it act so, then\r\nin a vacuum tube even of great length, and no matter how strong the\r\ncurrent, self-induction could not assert itself to any appreciable\r\ndegree. We have, then, as far as we can now see, in the gas a\r\nconductor which is capable of transmitting electric impulses of any\r\nfrequency which we may be able to produce. Could the frequency be\r\nbrought high enough, then a queer system of electric distribution,\r\nwhich would be likely to interest gas companies, might be realized:\r\nmetal pipes filled with gas--the metal being the insulator, the gas\r\nthe conductor--supplying phosphorescent bulbs, or perhaps devices as\r\nyet uninvented. It is certainly possible to take a hollow core of\r\ncopper, rarefy the gas in the same, and by passing impulses of\r\nsufficiently high frequency through a circuit around it, bring the gas\r\ninside to a high degree of incandescence; but as to the nature of the\r\nforces there would be considerable uncertainty, for it would be\r\ndoubtful whether with such impulses the copper core would act as a\r\nstatic screen. Such paradoxes and apparent impossibilities we\r\nencounter at every step in this line of work, and therein lies, to a\r\ngreat extent, the claim of the study.\r\n\r\nI have here a short and wide tube which is exhausted to a high degree\r\nand covered with a substantial coating of bronze, the coating allowing\r\nbarely the light to shine through. A metallic clasp, with a hook for\r\nsuspending the tube, is fastened around the middle portion of the\r\nlatter, the clasp being in contact with the bronze coating. I now want\r\nto light the gas inside by suspending the tube on a wire connected to\r\nthe coil. Any one who would try the experiment for the first time, not\r\nhaving any previous experience, would probably take care to be quite\r\nalone when making the trial, for fear that he might become the joke of\r\nhis assistants. Still, the bulb lights in spite of the metal coating,\r\nand the light can be distinctly perceived through the latter. A long\r\ntube covered with aluminium bronze lights when held in one hand--the\r\nother touching the terminal of the coil--quite powerfully. It might be\r\nobjected that the coatings are not sufficiently conducting; still,\r\neven if they were highly resistant, they ought to screen the gas. They\r\ncertainly screen it perfectly in a condition of rest, but not by far\r\nperfectly when the charge is surging in the coating. But the loss of\r\nenergy which occurs within the tube, notwithstanding the screen, is\r\noccasioned principally by the presence of the gas. Were we to take a\r\nlarge hollow metallic sphere and fill it with a perfect incompressible\r\nfluid dielectric, there would be no loss inside of the sphere, and\r\nconsequently the inside might be considered as perfectly screened,\r\nthough the potential be very rapidly alternating. Even were the sphere\r\nfilled with oil, the loss would be incomparably smaller than when the\r\nfluid is replaced by a gas, for in the latter case the force produces\r\ndisplacements; that means impact and collisions in the inside.\r\n\r\nNo matter what the pressure of the gas may be, it becomes an important\r\nfactor in the heating of a conductor when the electric density is\r\ngreat and the frequency very high. That in the heating of conductors\r\nby lightning discharges air is an element of great importance, is\r\nalmost as certain as an experimental fact. I may illustrate the action\r\nof the air by the following experiment: I take a short tube which is\r\nexhausted to a moderate degree and has a platinum wire running through\r\nthe middle from one end to the other. I pass a steady or low frequency\r\ncurrent through the wire, and it is heated uniformly in all parts. The\r\nheating here is due to conduction, or frictional losses, and the gas\r\naround the wire has--as far as we can see--no function to perform. But\r\nnow let me pass sudden discharges, or a high frequency current,\r\nthrough the wire. Again the wire is heated, this time principally on\r\nthe ends and least in the middle portion; and if the frequency of the\r\nimpulses, or the rate of change, is high enough, the wire might as\r\nwell be cut in the middle as not, for practically all the heating is\r\ndue to the rarefied gas. Here the gas might only act as a conductor of\r\nno impedance diverting the current from the wire as the impedance of\r\nthe latter is enormously increased, and merely heating the ends of the\r\nwire by reason of their resistance to the passage of the discharge.\r\nBut it is not at all necessary that the gas in the tube should he\r\nconducting; it might be at an extremely low pressure, still the ends\r\nof the wire would be heated--as, however, is ascertained by\r\nexperience--only the two ends would in such, case not be electrically\r\nconnected through the gaseous medium. Now what with these frequencies\r\nand potentials occurs in an exhausted tube occurs in the lightning\r\ndischarges at ordinary pressure. We only need remember one of the\r\nfacts arrived at in the course of these investigations, namely, that\r\nto impulses of very high frequency the gas at ordinary pressure\r\nbehaves much in the same manner as though it were at moderately low\r\npressure. I think that in lightning discharges frequently wires or\r\nconducting objects are volatilized merely because air is present and\r\nthat, were the conductor immersed in an insulating liquid, it would be\r\nsafe, for then the energy would have to spend itself somewhere else.\r\nFrom the behavior of gases to sudden impulses of high potential I am\r\nled to conclude that there can be no surer way of diverting a\r\nlightning discharge than by affording it a passage through a volume of\r\ngas, if such a thing can be done in a practical manner.\r\n\r\nThere are two more features upon which I think it necessary to dwell\r\nin connection with these experiments--the \"radiant state\" and the\r\n\"non-striking vacuum.\"\r\n\r\nAny one who has studied Crookes' work must have received the\r\nimpression that the \"radiant state\" is a property of the gas\r\ninseparably connected with an extremely high degree of exhaustion. But\r\nit should be remembered that the phenomena observed in an exhausted\r\nvessel are limited to the character and capacity of the apparatus\r\nwhich is made use of. I think that in a bulb a molecule, or atom, does\r\nnot precisely move in a straight line because it meets no obstacle,\r\nbut because the velocity imparted to it is sufficient to propel it in\r\na sensibly straight line. The mean free path is one thing, but the\r\nvelocity--the energy associated with the moving body--is another, and\r\nunder ordinary circumstances I believe that it is a mere question of\r\npotential or speed. A disruptive discharge coil, when the potential is\r\npushed very far, excites phosphorescence and projects shadows, at\r\ncomparatively low degrees of exhaustion. In a lightning discharge,\r\nmatter moves in straight lines as ordinary pressure when the mean free\r\npath is exceedingly small, and frequently images of wires or other\r\nmetallic objects have been produced by the particles thrown off in\r\nstraight lines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.--BULB SHOWING RADIANT LIME STREAM AT LOW\r\nEXHAUSTION.]\r\n\r\nI have prepared a bulb to illustrate by an experiment the correctness\r\nof these assertions. In a globe L (Fig. 31) I have mounted upon a lamp\r\nfilament f a piece of lime l. The lamp filament is connected with a\r\nwire which leads into the bulb, and the general construction of the\r\nlatter is as indicated in Fig. 19, before described. The bulb being\r\nsuspended from a wire connected to the terminal of the coil, and the\r\nlatter being set to work, the lime piece l and the projecting parts of\r\nthe filament f are bombarded. The degree of exhaustion is just such\r\nthat with the potential the coil is capable of giving phosphorescence\r\nof the glass is produced, but disappears as soon as the vacuum is\r\nimpaired. The lime containing moisture, and moisture being given off\r\nas soon as heating occurs, the phosphorescence lasts only for a few\r\nmoments. When the lime has been sufficiently heated, enough moisture\r\nhas been given off to impair materially the vacuum of the bulb. As the\r\nbombardment goes on, one point of the lime piece is more heated than\r\nother points, and the result is that finally practically all the\r\ndischarge passes through that point which is intensely heated, and a\r\nwhite stream of lime particles (Fig. 31) then breaks forth from that\r\npoint. This stream is composed of \"radiant\" matter, yet the degree of\r\nexhaustion is low. But the particles move in straight lines because\r\nthe velocity imparted to them is great, and this is due to three\r\ncauses--to the great electric density, the high temperature of the\r\nsmall point, and the fact that the particles of the lime are easily\r\ntorn and thrown off--far more easily than those of carbon. With\r\nfrequencies such as we are able to obtain, the particles are bodily\r\nthrown off and projected to a considerable distance; but with\r\nsufficiently high frequencies no such thing would occur: in such case\r\nonly a stress would spread or a vibration would be propagated through\r\nthe bulb. It would be out of the question to reach any such frequency\r\non the assumption that the atoms move with the speed of light; but I\r\nbelieve that such a thing is impossible; for this an enormous\r\npotential would be required. With potentials which we are able to\r\nobtain, even with a disruptive discharge coil, the speed must be quite\r\ninsignificant.\r\n\r\nAs to the \"non-striking vacuum,\" the point to be noted is that it can\r\noccur only with low frequency impulses, and it is necessitated by the\r\nimpossibility of carrying off enough energy with such impulses in high\r\nvacuum since the few atoms which are around the terminal upon coming\r\nin contact with the same are repelled and kept at a distance for a\r\ncomparatively long period of time, and not enough work can be\r\nperformed to render the effect perceptible to the eye. If the\r\ndifference of potential between the terminals is raised, the\r\ndielectric breaks down. But with very high frequency impulses there\r\nis no necessity for such breaking down, since any amount of work can\r\nbe performed by continually agitating the atoms in the exhausted\r\nvessel, provided the frequency is high enough. It is easy to\r\nreach--even with frequencies obtained from an alternator as here\r\nused--a stage at which the discharge does not pass between two\r\nelectrodes in a narrow tube, each of these being connected to one of\r\nthe terminals of the coil, but it is difficult to reach a point at\r\nwhich a luminous discharge would not occur around each electrode.\r\n\r\nA thought which naturally presents itself in connection with high\r\nfrequency currents, is to make use of their powerful electro-dynamic\r\ninductive action to produce light effects in a sealed glass globe. The\r\nleading-in wire is one of the defects of the present incandescent\r\nlamp, and if no other improvement were made, that imperfection at\r\nleast should be done away with. Following this thought, I have carried\r\non experiments in various directions, of which some were indicated in\r\nmy former paper. I may here mention one or two more lines of\r\nexperiment which have been followed up.\r\n\r\nMany bulbs were constructed as shown in Fig. 32 and Fig. 33.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 32 a wide tube T was sealed to a smaller W-shaped tube U, of\r\nphosphorescent glass. In the tube T was placed a coil C of aluminium\r\nwire, the ends of which were provided with small spheres t and t_1 of\r\naluminium, and reached into the U tube. The tube T was slipped into a\r\nsocket containing a primary coil through which usually the discharges\r\nof Leyden jars were directed, and the rarefied gas in the small U tube\r\nwas excited to strong luminosity by the high-tension currents induced\r\nin the coil C. When Leyden jar discharges were used to induce currents\r\nin the coil C, it was found necessary to pack the tube T tightly with\r\ninsulating powder, as a discharge would occur frequently between the\r\nturns of the coil, especially when the primary was thick and the air\r\ngap, through which the jars discharged, large, and no little trouble\r\nwas experienced in this way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.--ELECTRO-DYNAMIC INDUCTION TUBE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33--ELECTRO-DYNAMIC INDUCTION LAMP.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 33 is illustrated another form of the bulb constructed. In\r\nthis case a tube T is sealed to a globe L. The tube contains a coil C,\r\nthe ends of which pass through two small glass tubes t and t_1, which\r\nare sealed to the tube T. Two refractory buttons m and m_1 are mounted\r\non lamp filaments which are fastened to the ends of the wires passing\r\nthrough the glass tubes t and t_1. Generally in bulbs made on this\r\nplan the globe L communicated with the tube T. For this purpose the\r\nends of the small tubes t and t_1 were just a trifle heated in the\r\nburner, merely to hold the wires, but not to interfere with the\r\ncommunication. The tube T, with the small tubes, wires through the\r\nsame, and the refractory buttons m and m_1, was first prepared, and\r\nthen sealed to globe L, whereupon the coil C was slipped in and the\r\nconnections made to its ends. The tube was then packed with insulating\r\npowder, jamming the latter as tight as possible up to very nearly the\r\nend, then it was closed and only a small hole left through which the\r\nremainder of the powder was introduced, and finally the end of the\r\ntube was closed. Usually in bulbs constructed as shown in Fig. 33 an\r\naluminium tube a was fastened to the upper end s of each of the tubes\r\nt and t_1, in order to protect that end against the heat. The buttons\r\nm and m_1 could be brought to any degree of incandescence by passing\r\nthe discharges of Leyden jars around the coil C. In such bulbs with\r\ntwo buttons a very curious effect is produced by the formation of the\r\nshadows of each of the two buttons.\r\n\r\nAnother line of experiment, which has been assiduously followed, was\r\nto induce by electro-dynamic induction a current or luminous discharge\r\nin an exhausted tube or bulb. This matter has received such able\r\ntreatment at the hands of Prof. J.J. Thomson that I could add but\r\nlittle to what he has made known, even had I made it the special\r\nsubject of this lecture. Still, since experiences in this line have\r\ngradually led me to the present views and results, a few words must be\r\ndevoted here to this subject.\r\n\r\nIt has occurred, no doubt, to many that as a vacuum tube is made\r\nlonger the electromotive force per unit length of the tube, necessary\r\nto pass a luminous discharge through the latter, gets continually\r\nsmaller; therefore, if the exhausted tube be made long enough, even\r\nwith low frequencies a luminous discharge could be induced in such a\r\ntube closed upon itself. Such a tube might be placed around a ball or\r\non a ceiling, and at once a simple appliance capable of giving\r\nconsiderable light would be obtained. But this would be an appliance\r\nhard to manufacture and extremely unmanageable. It would not do to\r\nmake the tube up of small lengths, because there would be with\r\nordinary frequencies considerable loss in the coatings, and besides,\r\nif coatings were used, it would be better to supply the current\r\ndirectly to the tube by connecting the coatings to a transformer. But\r\neven if all objections of such nature were removed, still, with low\r\nfrequencies the light conversion itself would be inefficient, as I\r\nhave before stated. In using extremely high frequencies the length of\r\nthe secondary--in other words, the size of the vessel--can be reduced\r\nas far as desired, and the efficiency of the light conversion is\r\nincreased, provided that means are invented for efficiently obtaining\r\nsuch high frequencies. Thus one is led, from theoretical and practical\r\nconsiderations, to the use of high frequencies, and this means high\r\nelectromotive forces and small currents in the primary. When he works\r\nwith condenser charges--and they are the only means up to the present\r\nknown for reaching these extreme frequencies--he gets to electromotive\r\nforces of several thousands of volts per turn of the primary. He\r\ncannot multiply the electro-dynamic inductive effect by taking more\r\nturns in the primary, for he arrives at the conclusion that the best\r\nway is to work with one single turn--though he must sometimes depart\r\nfrom this rule--and he must get along with whatever inductive effect\r\nhe can obtain with one turn. But before he has long experimented with\r\nthe extreme frequencies required to set up in a small bulb an\r\nelectromotive force of several thousands of volts he realizes the\r\ngreat importance of electrostatic effects, and these effects grow\r\nrelatively to the electro-dynamic in significance as the frequency is\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\nNow, if anything is desirable in this case, it is to increase the\r\nfrequency, and this would make it still worse for the electro-dynamic\r\neffects. On the other hand, it is easy to exalt the electrostatic\r\naction as far as one likes by taking more turns on the secondary, or\r\ncombining self-induction and capacity to raise the potential. It\r\nshould also be remembered that, in reducing the current to the\r\nsmallest value and increasing the potential, the electric impulses of\r\nhigh frequency can be more easily transmitted through a conductor.\r\n\r\nThese and similar thoughts determined me to devote more attention to\r\nthe electrostatic phenomena, and to endeavor to produce potentials as\r\nhigh as possible, and alternating as fast as they could be made to\r\nalternate. I then found that I could excite vacuum tubes at\r\nconsiderable distance from a conductor connected to a properly\r\nconstructed coil, and that I could, by converting the oscillatory\r\ncurrent of a condenser to a higher potential, establish electrostatic\r\nalternating fields which acted through the whole extent of a room,\r\nlighting up a tube no matter where it was held in space. I thought I\r\nrecognized that I had made a step in advance, and I have persevered in\r\nthis line; but I wish to say that I share with all lovers of science\r\nand progress the one and only desire--to reach a result of utility to\r\nmen in any direction to which thought or experiment may lead me. I\r\nthink that this departure is the right one, for I cannot see, from the\r\nobservation of the phenomena which manifest themselves as the\r\nfrequency is increased, what there would remain to act between two\r\ncircuits conveying, for instance, impulses of several hundred millions\r\nper second, except electrostatic forces. Even with such trifling\r\nfrequencies the energy would be practically all potential, and my\r\nconviction has grown strong that, to whatever kind of motion light may\r\nbe due, it is produced by tremendous electrostatic stresses vibrating\r\nwith extreme rapidity.\r\n\r\nOf all these phenomena observed with currents, or electric impulses,\r\nof high frequency, the most fascinating for an audience are certainly\r\nthose which are noted in an electrostatic field acting through\r\nconsiderable distance, and the best an unskilled lecturer can do is\r\nto begin and finish with the exhibition of these singular effects. I\r\ntake a tube in the hand and move it about, and it is lighted wherever\r\nI may hold it; throughout space the invisible forces act. But I may\r\ntake another tube and it might not light, the vacuum being very high.\r\nI excite it by means of a disruptive discharge coil, and now it will\r\nlight in the electrostatic field. I may put it away for a few weeks or\r\nmonths, still it retains the faculty of being excited. What change\r\nhave I produced in the tube in the act of exciting it? If a motion\r\nimparted to the atoms, it is difficult to perceive how it can persist\r\nso long without being arrested by frictional losses; and if a strain\r\nexerted in the dielectric, such as a simple electrification would\r\nproduce, it is easy to see how it may persist indefinitely, but very\r\ndifficult to understand why such a condition should aid the excitation\r\nwhen we have to deal with potentials which are rapidly alternating.\r\n\r\nSince I have exhibited these phenomena for the first time, I have\r\nobtained some other interesting effects. For instance, I have produced\r\nthe incandescence of a button, filament, or wire enclosed in a tube.\r\nTo get to this result it was necessary to economize the energy which\r\nis obtained from the field and direct most of it on the small body to\r\nbe rendered incandescent. At the beginning the task appeared\r\ndifficult, but the experiences gathered permitted me to reach the\r\nresult easily. In Fig. 34 and Fig. 35 two such tubes are illustrated\r\nwhich are prepared for the occasion. In Fig. 34 a short tube T_1,\r\nsealed to another long tube T, is provided with a stem s, with a\r\nplatinum wire sealed in the latter. A very thin lamp filament l is\r\nfastened to this wire, and connection to the outside is made through a\r\nthin copper wire w. The tube is provided with outside and inside\r\ncoatings, C and C_1 respectively, and is filled as far as the coatings\r\nreach with conducting, and the space above with insulating powder.\r\nThese coatings are merely used to enable me to perform two experiments\r\nwith the tube--namely, to produce the effect desired either by direct\r\nconnection of the body of the experimenter or of another body to the\r\nwire w, or by acting inductively through the glass. The stem s is\r\nprovided with an aluminium tube a, for purposes before explained, and\r\nonly a small part of the filament reaches out of this tube. By holding\r\nthe tube T_1 anywhere in the electrostatic field the filament is\r\nrendered incandescent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.--TUBE WITH FILAMENT RENDERED INCANDESCENT IN\r\nAN ELECTROSTATIC FIELD.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.--CROOKES' EXPERIMENT IN ELECTROSTATIC FIELD.]\r\n\r\nA more interesting piece of apparatus is illustrated in Fig. 35. The\r\nconstruction is the same as before, only instead of the lamp filament\r\na small platinum wire p, sealed in a stem s, and bent above it in a\r\ncircle, is connected to the copper wire w, which is joined to an\r\ninside coating C. A small stem s_1 is provided with a needle, on the\r\npoint of which is arranged to rotate very freely a very light fan of\r\nmica v. To prevent the fan from falling out, a thin stem of glass g is\r\nbent properly and fastened to the aluminium tube. When the glass tube\r\nis held anywhere in the electrostatic field the platinum wire becomes\r\nincandescent, and the mica vanes are rotated very fast.\r\n\r\nIntense phosphorescence may be excited in a bulb by merely connecting\r\nit to a plate within the field, and the plate need not be any larger\r\nthan an ordinary lamp shade. The phosphorescence excited with these\r\ncurrents is incomparably more powerful than with ordinary apparatus. A\r\nsmall phosphorescent bulb, when attached to a wire connected to a\r\ncoil, emits sufficient light to allow reading ordinary print at a\r\ndistance of five to six paces. It was of interest to see how some of\r\nthe phosphorescent bulbs of Professor Crookes would behave with these\r\ncurrents, and he has had the kindness to lend me a few for the\r\noccasion. The effects produced are magnificent, especially by the\r\nsulphide of calcium and sulphide of zinc. From the disruptive\r\ndischarge coil they glow intensely merely by holding them in the hand\r\nand connecting the body to the terminal of the coil.\r\n\r\nTo whatever results investigations of this kind may lead, their chief\r\ninterest lies for the present in the possibilities they offer for the\r\nproduction of an efficient illuminating device. In no branch of\r\nelectric industry is an advance more desired than in the manufacture\r\nof light. Every thinker, when considering the barbarous methods\r\nemployed, the deplorable losses incurred in our best systems of light\r\nproduction, must have asked himself, What is likely to be the light of\r\nthe future? Is it to be an incandescent solid, as in the present lamp,\r\nor an incandescent gas, or a phosphorescent body, or something like a\r\nburner, but incomparably more efficient?\r\n\r\nThere is little chance to perfect a gas burner; not, perhaps, because\r\nhuman ingenuity has been bent upon that problem for centuries without\r\na radical departure having been made--though this argument is not\r\ndevoid of force-but because in a burner the higher vibrations can\r\nnever be reached except by passing through all the low ones. For how\r\nis a flame produced unless by a fall of lifted weights? Such process\r\ncannot be maintained without renewal, and renewal is repeated passing\r\nfrom low to high vibrations. One way only seems to be open to improve\r\na burner, and that is by trying to reach higher degrees of\r\nincandescence. Higher incandescence is equivalent to a quicker\r\nvibration; that means more light from the same material, and that,\r\nagain, means more economy. In this direction some improvements have\r\nbeen made, but the progress is hampered by many limitations.\r\nDiscarding, then, the burner, there remain the three ways first\r\nmentioned, which are essentially electrical.\r\n\r\nSuppose the light of the immediate future to be a solid rendered\r\nincandescent by electricity. Would it not seem that it is better to\r\nemploy a small button than a frail filament? From many considerations\r\nit certainly must be concluded that a button is capable of a higher\r\neconomy, assuming, of course, the difficulties connected with the\r\noperation of such a lamp to be effectively overcome. But to light such\r\na lamp we require a high potential; and to get this economically we\r\nmust use high frequencies.\r\n\r\nSuch considerations apply even more to the production of light by the\r\nincandescence of a gas, or by phosphorescence. In all cases we require\r\nhigh frequencies and high potentials. These thoughts occurred to me a\r\nlong time ago.\r\n\r\nIncidentally we gain, by the use of very high frequencies, many\r\nadvantages, such as a higher economy in the light production, the\r\npossibility of working with one lead, the possibility of doing away\r\nwith the leading-in wire, etc.\r\n\r\nThe question is, how far can we go with frequencies? Ordinary\r\nconductors rapidly lose the facility of transmitting electric impulses\r\nwhen the frequency is greatly increased. Assume the means for the\r\nproduction of impulses of very great frequency brought to the utmost\r\nperfection, every one will naturally ask how to transmit them when the\r\nnecessity arises. In transmitting such impulses through conductors we\r\nmust remember that we have to deal with _pressure_ and _flow_, in the\r\nordinary interpretation of these terms. Let the pressure increase to\r\nan enormous value, and let the flow correspondingly diminish, then\r\nsuch impulses--variations merely of pressure, as it were--can no doubt\r\nbe transmitted through a wire even if their frequency be many hundreds\r\nof millions per second. It would, of course, be out of question to\r\ntransmit such impulses through a wire immersed in a gaseous medium,\r\neven if the wire were provided with a thick and excellent insulation\r\nfor most of the energy would be lost in molecular bombardment and\r\nconsequent heating. The end of the wire connected to the source would\r\nbe heated, and the remote end would receive but a trifling part of the\r\nenergy supplied. The prime necessity, then, if such electric impulses\r\nare to be used, is to find means to reduce as much as possible the\r\ndissipation.\r\n\r\nThe first thought is, employ the thinnest possible wire surrounded by\r\nthe thickest practicable insulation. The next thought is to employ\r\nelectrostatic screens. The insulation of the wire may be covered with\r\na thin conducting coating and the latter connected to the ground. But\r\nthis would not do, as then all the energy would pass through the\r\nconducting coating to the ground and nothing would get to the end of\r\nthe wire. If a ground connection is made it can only be made through a\r\nconductor offering an enormous impedance, or though a condenser of\r\nextremely small capacity. This, however, does not do away with other\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\nIf the wave length of the impulses is much smaller than the length of\r\nthe wire, then corresponding short waves will be sent up in the\r\nconducting coating, and it will be more or less the same as though the\r\ncoating were directly connected to earth. It is therefore necessary to\r\ncut up the coating in sections much shorter than the wave length. Such\r\nan arrangement does not still afford a perfect screen, but it is ten\r\nthousand times better than none. I think it preferable to cut up the\r\nconducting coating in small sections, even if the current waves be\r\nmuch longer than the coating.\r\n\r\nIf a wire were provided with a perfect electrostatic screen, it would\r\nbe the same as though all objects were removed from it at infinite\r\ndistance. The capacity would then be reduced to the capacity of the\r\nwire itself, which would be very small. It would then be possible to\r\nsend over the wire current vibrations of very high frequencies at\r\nenormous distance without affecting greatly the character of the\r\nvibrations. A perfect screen is of course out of the question, but I\r\nbelieve that with a screen such as I have just described telephony\r\ncould be rendered practicable across the Atlantic. According to my\r\nideas, the gutta-percha covered wire should be provided with a third\r\nconducting coating subdivided in sections. On the top of this should\r\nbe again placed a layer of gutta-percha and other insulation, and on\r\nthe top of the whole the armor. But such cables will not be\r\nconstructed, for ere long intelligence--transmitted without\r\nwires--will throb through the earth like a pulse through a living\r\norganism. The wonder is that, with the present state of knowledge and\r\nthe experiences gained, no attempt is being made to disturb the\r\nelectrostatic or magnetic condition of the earth, and transmit, if\r\nnothing else, intelligence.\r\n\r\nIt has been my chief aim in presenting these results to point out\r\nphenomena or features of novelty, and to advance ideas which I am\r\nhopeful will serve as starting points of new departures. It has been\r\nmy chief desire this evening to entertain you with some novel\r\nexperiments. Your applause, so frequently and generously accorded, has\r\ntold me that I have succeeded.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, let me thank you most heartily for your kindness and\r\nattention, and assure you that the honor I have had in addressing such\r\na distinguished audience, the pleasure I have had in presenting these\r\nresults to a gathering of so many able men--and among them also some\r\nof those in whose work for many years past I have found enlightenment\r\nand constant pleasure--I shall never forget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note: Corrected the following typesetting errors:\r\n     1) 'preceived' to 'perceived', page 16.\r\n     2) 'disharging' to 'discharging', page 30.\r\n     3) 'park' to 'spark', page 33.\r\n     4) 'pssition' to 'position', page 50.\r\n     5) 'to th opposite side' to 'to the opposite side', page 56.\r\n     6) 's resses' to 'stresses', page 147.]",
