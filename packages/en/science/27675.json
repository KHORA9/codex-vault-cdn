Economic considerations have\r\n  played second fiddle to political and military upheavals during more\r\n  than 16 years of war, including the nearly 10-year Soviet military\r\n  occupation (which ended 15 February 1989). Over the past decade,\r\n  one-third of the population fled the country, with Pakistan and Iran\r\n  sheltering more than 6 million refugees. Now, only 1.0 million\r\n  Afghan refugees remain in Pakistan and about 1.3 million in Iran.\r\n  Another 1 million probably moved into and around urban areas within\r\n  Afghanistan. Gross domestic product has fallen substantially over\r\n  the past 15 years because of the loss of labor and capital and the\r\n  disruption of trade and transport. Millions of people continue to\r\n  suffer from insufficient food, clothing, housing, and lack of\r\n  medical care. Numerical data are extremely shaky.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $12.8 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $600 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 65%\r\n  industry: 15%\r\n  services: 20%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): NA%\r\n\r\nLabor force: 4.98 million\r\n  by occupation: agriculture and animal husbandry 67.8%, industry\r\n  10.2%, construction 6.3%, commerce 5.0%, services and other 10.7%\r\n  (1980 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $NA\r\n  expenditures: $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n\r\nIndustries: small-scale production of textiles, soap, furniture,\r\n  shoes, fertilizer, and cement;

The economy rebounded in 1993-95 after a severe\r\n  depression accompanying the collapse of the previous centrally\r\n  planned system in 1990 and 1991. Stabilization policies - including\r\n  a strict monetary policy, public sector layoffs, and reduced social\r\n  services - have improved the government's fiscal situation and\r\n  reduced inflation. The recovery has been spurred by the remittances\r\n  of some 20% of the labor force which works abroad, mostly in Greece\r\n  and Italy. These remittances supplement GDP and help offset the\r\n  large foreign trade deficit. Foreign assistance and humanitarian aid\r\n  also supported the recovery. Most agricultural land was privatized\r\n  in 1992, substantially improving peasant incomes. Albania's\r\n  industrial sector ended its five-year, 78% decline in 1995,\r\n  recording roughly 6% growth. A sharp fall in chromium prices has\r\n  reduced hard currency receipts from the mining sector. Large\r\n  segments of the population, especially those living in urban areas,\r\n  continue to depend on humanitarian aid to meet basic food\r\n  requirements. Unemployment remains a severe problem accounting for\r\n  approximately one-fifth of the work force. Now that sanctions on\r\n  Serbia have been suspended, the falloff in hard currency earnings\r\n  from smuggling will aggravate unemployment problems. Growth is\r\n  expected to continue in 1996, but could falter if workers'\r\n  remittances from Greece are reduced or foreign assistance declines.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $4.1 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 6% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $1,210 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 55%\r\n  industry: NA%\r\n  services: NA% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 16% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 1.692 million (1994 est.)

In 1989, the\r\n  government launched a comprehensive, IMF-supported program to\r\n  achieve economic stabilization and to introduce market mechanisms\r\n  into the economy. Despite substantial progress toward economic\r\n  adjustment, in 1992 the reform drive stalled as Algiers became\r\n  embroiled in political turmoil. In September 1993, a new government\r\n  was formed, and one priority was the resumption and acceleration of\r\n  the structural adjustment process. Buffeted by the slump in world\r\n  oil prices and burdened with a heavy foreign debt, Algiers concluded\r\n  a one-year standby arrangement with the IMF in April 1994. Following\r\n  a Paris Club debt rescheduling in 1995 and a robust harvest, the\r\n  economy experienced a strong recovery and key economic improvements.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $108.7 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 3.5% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $3,800 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 12%\r\n  industry: 50%\r\n  services: 38%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 28% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 6.2 million (1992 est.)\r\n  by occupation: government 29.5%, agriculture 22%, construction and\r\n  public works 16.2%, industry 13.6%, commerce and services 13.5%,\r\n  transportation and communication 5.2% (1989)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 25% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $14.3 billion\r\n  expenditures: $17.9 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: petroleum, light industries, natural gas, mining,\r\n  electrical, petrochemical, food processing\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 5,370,000 kW\r\n  production: 18.3 billion kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 587 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: wheat, barley, oats, grapes, olives, citrus, fruits;\r\n  sheep, cattle\r\n\r\nExports: $9.5 billion (f.o.b., 1995 est.)\r\n  commodities: petroleum and natural gas 97%\r\n  partners: Italy 21%, France 16%, US 14%, Germany 13%, Spain 9%\r\n\r\nImports: $10.6 billion (f.o.b., 1995 est.)\r\n  commodities: capital goods 39.7%, food and beverages 21.7%, consumer\r\n  goods 11.8% (1990)\r\n  partners: France 29%, Italy 14%, Spain 9%, US 9%, Germany 7%\r\n\r\nExternal debt: $26 billion (1994)\r\n\r\nEconomic aid:\r\n  recipient: ODA, $316 million (1993)\r\n\r\nCurrency: 1 Algerian dinar (DA) = 100 centimes\r\n\r\nExchange rates: Algerian dinars (DA) per US$1 - 53.003 (January\r\n  1996), 47.663 (1995), 35.059 (1994), 23.345 (1993), 21.836 (1992),\r\n  18.473 (1991)\r\n\r\nFiscal year: calendar year\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTransportation\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n\r\nRailways:\r\n  total: 4,772 km\r\n  standard gauge: 3,616 km 1.435-m gauge (301 km electrified;

An estimated 13\r\n  million tourists visit annually, attracted by Andorra's duty-free\r\n  status and by its summer and winter resorts. Andorra's comparative\r\n  advantage has recently eroded as the economies of neighboring France\r\n  and Spain have been opened up, providing broader availability of\r\n  goods and lower tariffs. The banking sector, with its \"tax haven\"\r\n  status, also contributes substantially to the economy. Agricultural\r\n  production is limited by a scarcity of arable land, and most food\r\n  has to be imported. The principal livestock activity is sheep\r\n  raising. Manufacturing consists mainly of cigarettes, cigars, and\r\n  furniture. Andorra is a member of the EU Customs Union and is\r\n  treated as an EU member for trade in manufactured goods (no tariffs)\r\n  and as a non-EU member for agricultural products.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $1 billion (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $16,200 (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: NA%\r\n  industry: NA%\r\n  services: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): NA%\r\n\r\nLabor force: NA\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 0%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $138 million\r\n  expenditures: $177 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1993)\r\n\r\nIndustries: tourism (particularly skiing), sheep, timber, tobacco,\r\n  banking\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 35,000 kW\r\n  production: 140 million kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 2,570 kWh (1992)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: small quantities of tobacco, rye, wheat, barley,\r\n  oats, vegetables; sheep raising\r\n\r\nExports: $46.2 million (f.o.b., 1993)\r\n  commodities: electricity, tobacco products, furniture\r\n  partners: France 35%, Spain 59%\r\n\r\nImports: $920.2 million (1993)\r\n  commodities: consumer goods, food\r\n  partners: France, Spain, US 2.6% (1992)\r\n\r\nExternal debt: $NA\r\n\r\nEconomic aid: none\r\n\r\nCurrency: 1 French franc (F) = 100 centimes; 1 peseta (Pta) = 100\r\n  centimos; the French and Spanish currencies are used\r\n\r\nExchange rates: French francs (F) per US$1 - 5.0056 (January\r\n  1996), 4.9915 (1995), 5.5520 (1994), 5.6632 (1993), 5.2938 (1992),\r\n  5.6421 (1991); Spanish pesetas (Ptas) per US$1 - 123.19 (January\r\n  1996), 124.69 (1995), 133.96 (1994), 127.26 (1993), 102.38 (1992),\r\n  103.91 (1991)\r\n\r\nFiscal year: calendar year\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTransportation\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n\r\nRailways: 0 km\r\n\r\nHighways:\r\n  total: 269 km\r\n  paved: 198 km\r\n  unpaved: 71 km (1991 est.)\r\n\r\nPorts: none\r\n\r\nAirports: none\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommunications\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n\r\nTelephones: 21,258 (1983 est.)\r\n\r\nTelephone system:\r\n  domestic: modern system with microwave radio relay connections\r\n  between exchanges\r\n  international: landline circuits to France and Spain\r\n\r\nRadio broadcast stations: AM 1, FM 0, shortwave 0\r\n\r\nRadios: 10,000 (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nTelevision broadcast stations: 0\r\n\r\nTelevisions: 7,000 (1991 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDefense\r\n-------\r\n\r\n\r\nDefense note: defense is the responsibility of France and Spain\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n======================================================================\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n@Angola\r\n------\r\n\r\n\r\nCivil war has been the norm since independence from Portugal on 11\r\nNovember 1975; a cease-fire lasted from 31 May 1991 until October\r\n1992 when the insurgent National Union for the Total Independence of\r\nAngola (UNITA) refused to accept its defeat in internationally\r\nmonitored elections and fighting resumed throughout much of the\r\ncountryside.

Despite its\r\n  abundant natural resources, output per capita is among the world's\r\n  lowest. Subsistence agriculture provides the main livelihood for\r\n  80%-90% of the population but accounts for less than 15% of GDP. Oil\r\n  production and the supporting activities are vital to the economy,\r\n  contributing about 50% to GDP. Despite the signing of a peace accord\r\n  in November 1994 between the Angola Government and the UNITA\r\n  insurgents, sporadic fighting continues and many farmers remain\r\n  reluctant to return to their fields. As a result, much of the\r\n  country's food must still be imported. To take advantage of its rich\r\n  resources - notably gold, diamonds, extensive forests, Atlantic\r\n  fisheries, and arable land, in addition to its large oil deposits -\r\n  Angola will need to observe the cease-fire, implement the peace\r\n  agreement, and reform government policies.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $7.4 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 4% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $700 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 12%\r\n  industry: 56%\r\n  services: 32% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 20% monthly average (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 2.783 million economically active\r\n  by occupation: agriculture 85%, industry 15% (1985 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 24% with extensive underemployment (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $928 million\r\n  expenditures: $2.5 billion, including capital expenditures of $963\r\n  million (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: petroleum;

Output growth has averaged\r\n  about 7% in recent years, mainly as a result of boom in tourism\r\n  thanks to economic expansion in North America and the UK. The\r\n  economy, and especially the tourism sector, suffered a setback in\r\n  late 1995 due to the effects of Hurricane Luis in September.\r\n  Agricultural output had only just begun to recover from a drought in\r\n  1994 when Luis hit. Anguillan officials have put substantial effort\r\n  into developing the offshore financing sector. A comprehensive\r\n  package of financial services legislation was enacted in late 1994.\r\n  In the medium term, prospects for the economy will depend on the\r\n  tourism sector and, therefore, on continuing income growth in the\r\n  industrialized nations.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $53 million (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 6.5% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $7,600 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: NA%\r\n  industry: NA%\r\n  services: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 4% (1994)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 4,400 (1992)\r\n  by occupation: commerce 36%, services 29%, construction 18%,\r\n  transportation and utilities 10%, manufacturing 3%,\r\n  agriculture/fishing/forestry/mining 4%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 7% (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $13.5 million (1993)\r\n  expenditures: $17.6 million, including capital expenditures of\r\n  $740,000 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: tourism, boat building, offshore financial services\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 2,000 kW\r\n  production: 6 million kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 862 kWh (1992)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: pigeon peas, corn, sweet potatoes;

Administration is\r\n  carried out through consultative member meetings - the 18th\r\n  Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting was in Japan in April 1993.\r\n  Currently, there are 42 treaty member nations: 26 consultative and\r\n  16 acceding. Consultative (voting) members include the seven nations\r\n  that claim portions of Antarctica as national territory (some claims\r\n  overlap) and 19 nonclaimant nations. The US and some other nations\r\n  that have made no claims have reserved the right to do so. The US\r\n  does not recognize the claims of others. The year in parentheses\r\n  indicates when an acceding nation was voted to full consultative\r\n  (voting) status, while no date indicates the country was an original\r\n  1959 treaty signatory. Claimant nations are - Argentina, Australia,\r\n  Chile, France, New Zealand, Norway, and the UK. Nonclaimant\r\n  consultative nations are - Belgium, Brazil (1983), China (1985),\r\n  Ecuador (1990), Finland (1989), Germany (1981), India (1983), Italy\r\n  (1987), Japan, South Korea (1989), Netherlands (1990), Peru (1989),\r\n  Poland (1977), South Africa, Spain (1988), Sweden (1988), Uruguay\r\n  (1985), the US, and Russia. Acceding (nonvoting) members, with year\r\n  of accession in parentheses, are - Austria (1987), Bulgaria (1978),\r\n  Canada (1988), Colombia (1988), Cuba (1984), Czech Republic (1993),\r\n  Denmark (1965), Greece (1987), Guatemala (1991), Hungary (1984),\r\n  North Korea (1987), Papua New Guinea (1981), Romania (1971),\r\n  Slovakia (1993), Switzerland (1990), and Ukraine (1992).\r\n  Article 1: area to be used for peaceful purposes only; military\r\n  activity, such as weapons testing, is prohibited, but military\r\n  personnel and equipment may be used for scientific research or any\r\n  other peaceful purpose\r\n  Article 2: freedom of scientific investigation and cooperation shall\r\n  continue\r\n  Article 3: free exchange of information and personnel in cooperation\r\n  with the UN and other international agencies\r\n  Article 4: does not recognize, dispute, or establish territorial\r\n  claims and no new claims shall be asserted while the treaty is in\r\n  force\r\n  Article 5: prohibits nuclear explosions or disposal of radioactive\r\n  wastes\r\n  Article 6: includes under the treaty all land and ice shelves south\r\n  of 60 degrees 00 minutes south\r\n  Article 7: treaty-state observers have free access, including aerial\r\n  observation, to any area and may inspect all stations,\r\n  installations, and equipment; advance notice of all activities and\r\n  of the introduction of military personnel must be given\r\n  Article 8: allows for jurisdiction over observers and scientists by\r\n  their own states\r\n  Article 9: frequent consultative meetings take place among member\r\n  nations\r\n  Article 10: treaty states will discourage activities by any country\r\n  in Antarctica that are contrary to the treaty\r\n  Article 11: disputes to be settled peacefully by the parties\r\n  concerned or, ultimately, by the ICJ\r\n  Articles 12 13 14: deal with upholding, interpreting, and amending\r\n  the treaty among involved nations\r\n  Other agreements: more than 170 recommendations adopted at treaty\r\n  consultative meetings and ratified by governments include - Agreed\r\n  Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora (1964);\r\n  Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals (1972);\r\n  Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources\r\n  (1980); a mineral resources agreement was signed in 1988 but was\r\n  subsequently rejected; in 1991 the Protocol on Environmental\r\n  Protection to the Antarctic Treaty was signed and awaits\r\n  ratification; this agreement provides for the protection of the\r\n  Antarctic environment through five specific annexes on marine\r\n  pollution, fauna, and flora, environmental impact assessments, waste\r\n  management, and protected areas; it also prohibits all activities\r\n  relating to mineral resources except scientific research; 21 parties\r\n  have ratified Protocol as of April 1996\r\n\r\nLegal system: US law, including certain criminal offenses by or\r\n  against US nationals, such as murder, may apply to areas not under\r\n  jurisdiction of other countries. Some US laws directly apply to\r\n  Antarctica. For example, the Antarctic Conservation Act, 16 U.S.C.\r\n  section 2401 et seq., provides civil and criminal penalties for the\r\n  following activities, unless authorized by regulation of statute:\r\n  The taking of native mammals or birds; the introduction of\r\n  nonindigenous plants and animals; entry into specially protected or\r\n  scientific areas; the discharge or disposal of pollutants; and the\r\n  importation into the US of certain items from Antarctica. Violation\r\n  of the Antarctic Conservation Act carries penalties of up to $10,000\r\n  in fines and 1 year in prison. The Departments of Treasury,\r\n  Commerce, Transportation, and Interior share enforcement\r\n  responsibilities. Public Law 95-541, the US Antarctic Conservation\r\n  Act of 1978, requires expeditions from the US to Antarctica to\r\n  notify, in advance, the Office of Oceans and Polar Affairs, Room\r\n  5801, Department of State, Washington, DC 20520, which reports such\r\n  plans to other nations as required by the Antarctic Treaty.

Tourism's direct contribution to output in\r\n  1994 was about 20%. In addition, increased tourist arrivals helped\r\n  spur growth in the construction and transport sectors. The dual\r\n  island nation's agricultural production is mainly directed to the\r\n  domestic market; the sector is constrained by the limited water\r\n  supply and labor shortages that reflect the pull of higher wages in\r\n  tourism and construction. Manufacturing - which accounts for 3.5% of\r\n  GDP - comprises enclave-type assembly for export with major products\r\n  being bedding, handicrafts, and electronic components. Prospects for\r\n  economic growth in the medium term will continue to depend on income\r\n  growth in the industrialized world, especially in the US, which\r\n  accounts for about half of all tourist arrivals.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $425 million (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 4.2% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $6,600 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 3.5%\r\n  industry: 19.3%\r\n  services: 77.2% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 3.5% (1994)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 30,000\r\n  by occupation: commerce and services 82%, agriculture 11%, industry\r\n  7% (1983)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 5%-10%(1995 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $134 million\r\n  expenditures: $135.4 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1995)\r\n\r\nIndustries: tourism, construction, light manufacturing (clothing,\r\n  alcohol, household appliances)\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: -4.9% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 52,100 kW\r\n  production: 95 million kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 1,242 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: cotton, fruits, vegetables, bananas, coconuts,\r\n  cucumbers, mangoes, sugarcane;

Elected in\r\n  1989, in the depths of recession, President MENEM has implemented a\r\n  comprehensive economic restructuring program that shows signs of\r\n  putting Argentina on a path of stable, sustainable growth.\r\n  Argentina's currency has traded at par with the US dollar since\r\n  April 1991, and inflation has fallen to its lowest level in 20\r\n  years. Argentines have responded to the relative price stability by\r\n  repatriating flight capital and investing in domestic industry.\r\n  After registering impressive 7.4% growth in 1994, based largely on\r\n  inflows of foreign capital and strong domestic consumption, the\r\n  Argentine economy stumbled in 1995 as financial pressures fueled by\r\n  the Mexican peso crisis and political squabbling within the MENEM\r\n  administration undermined investor confidence and triggered capital\r\n  outflows. By yearend, GDP had contracted 4.4%, unemployment reached\r\n  16%, and Buenos Aires struggled to meet fiscal targets. On the trade\r\n  front, exports soared during the first half of 1995 - largely\r\n  because of strong demand in Brazil and high commodity prices - while\r\n  anemic domestic consumption lowered imports; the resulting yearend\r\n  trade surplus was about $1.2 billion. However, because exports\r\n  contribute only 7.5% to GDP, increased foreign sales had little\r\n  impact on aggregate growth. High unemployment will continue to\r\n  plague the MENEM administration for the next several years as\r\n  provincial entities are readied for privatization and more public\r\n  sector employees are laid off.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $278.5 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: -4.4%\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $8,100 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 6%\r\n  industry: 31%\r\n  services: 63% (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 1.7% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 10.9 million\r\n  by occupation: agriculture 12%, industry 31%, services 57% (1985\r\n  est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 16% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $48.46 billion\r\n  expenditures: $46.5 billion, including capital expenditures of $3.5\r\n  billion (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: food processing, motor vehicles, consumer durables,\r\n  textiles, chemicals and petrochemicals, printing, metallurgy, steel\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: -4.6% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 17,330,000 kW\r\n  production: 54.8 billion kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 1,610 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: wheat, corn, sorghum, soybeans, sugar beets;

The rapid growth of the tourism sector over the last\r\n  decade has resulted in a substantial expansion of other activities.\r\n  Construction has boomed, with hotel capacity five times the 1985\r\n  level. In addition, the reopening of the country's oil refinery in\r\n  1993, a major source of employment and foreign exchange earnings,\r\n  has further spurred growth.

Rich in natural\r\n  resources, Australia is a major exporter of agricultural products,\r\n  minerals, metals, and fossil fuels. Commodities account for more\r\n  than 80% of the value of total exports, so that, as in 1983-84, a\r\n  downturn in world commodity prices can have a big impact on the\r\n  economy. The government is pushing for increased exports of\r\n  manufactured goods, but competition in international markets\r\n  continues to be severe. Australia has suffered from the low growth\r\n  and high unemployment characterizing the OECD countries in the early\r\n  1990s. In 1992-93 the economy recovered slowly from the prolonged\r\n  recession of 1990-91, a major restraining factor being weak world\r\n  demand for Australia's exports. Growth picked up so strongly in 1994\r\n  that the government felt the need for fiscal and monetary tightening\r\n  by yearend. Australia's GDP grew 6.4% in 1994, largely due to\r\n  increases in industrial output and business investment. A severe\r\n  drought in 1994 reduced the value of Australia's net farm\r\n  production, but rising world commodity prices are likely to boost\r\n  commodity exports by 15% to $42.4 billion in 1995/96, according to\r\n  government statistics. Short-term economic problems include a\r\n  balancing of output growth and inflationary pressures and the\r\n  stimulation of exports to offset rising imports.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $405.4 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 3.3% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $22,100 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 3.1%\r\n  industry: 27.7%\r\n  services: 69.2% (1994)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 4.75% (1995)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 8.63 million (September 1991)\r\n  by occupation: finance and services 33.8%, public and community\r\n  services 22.3%, wholesale and retail trade 20.1%, manufacturing and\r\n  industry 16.2%, agriculture 6.1% (1987)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 8.1% (December 1995)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $95.69 billion\r\n  expenditures: $95.15 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (FY95/96 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: mining, industrial and transportation equipment, food\r\n  processing, chemicals, steel\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 3.9% (FY93/94)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 34,540,000 kW\r\n  production: 155 billion kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 8,021 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: wheat, barley, sugarcane, fruits;

Austria's\r\n  economy is closely integrated with Germany and other EU members -\r\n  Austria joined the EU on 1 January 1995. Since the early 1980s, the\r\n  Austrian economy has experienced stable growth. Following a mild\r\n  recession in 1993, Austria's economy - driven by strong exports,\r\n  investment, and private consumption - expanded 2.7% in 1994 and\r\n  about 2.4% in 1995. The slowdown in 1995 was largely due to an\r\n  appreciation of the Austrian schilling and its negative effect on\r\n  exports and tourism. EU membership has had a positive impact on\r\n  foreign investment and has helped to lower inflation. Despite\r\n  Austria's generally favorable economic prospects, the government\r\n  faces a number of economic challenges, especially budget\r\n  consolidation. Smaller than expected revenues and rising welfare\r\n  payments caused the budget deficit to climb to 7.1% of GDP in 1995.\r\n  Austria also faces a growing unemployment problem. Although low by\r\n  European standards, Austria's unemployment rate has risen gradually\r\n  during the 1990s as companies restructured to meet competition from\r\n  the EU single market and Eastern Europe.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $152 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 2.4% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $19,000 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 2%\r\n  industry: 34%\r\n  services: 64% (1994)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 2.3% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 3.47 million (1989)\r\n  by occupation: services 56.4%, industry and crafts 35.4%,\r\n  agriculture and forestry 8.1%\r\n  note: an estimated 200,000 Austrians are employed in other European\r\n  countries; foreign laborers in Austria number 177,840, about 5% of\r\n  labor force (1988)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 4.6% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $65 billion\r\n  expenditures: $75.8 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: food, iron and steel, machines, textiles, chemicals,\r\n  electrical, paper and pulp, tourism, mining, motor vehicles\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 7.7% (first half 1995)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 17,230,000 kW\r\n  production: 50.2 billion kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 5,824 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: grains, fruit, potatoes, sugar beets; cattle, pigs,\r\n  poultry; sawn wood\r\n\r\nIllicit drugs: transshipment point for Southwest Asian heroin\r\n  transiting the Balkan route and Eastern Europe\r\n\r\nExports: $45.2 billion (1994)\r\n  commodities: machinery and equipment, iron and steel, lumber,\r\n  textiles, paper products, chemicals\r\n  partners: EU 64.8% (Germany 38.1%, Italy 8.1%), Eastern Europe\r\n  11.8%, Japan 1.6%, US 3.5% (1994)\r\n\r\nImports: $55.3 billion (1994)\r\n  commodities: petroleum, foodstuffs, machinery and equipment,\r\n  vehicles, chemicals, textiles and clothing, pharmaceuticals\r\n  partners: EU 68.4% (Germany 40%, Italy 8.8%), Eastern Europe 6.55%,\r\n  Japan 4.3%, US 4.4% (1994)\r\n\r\nExternal debt: $28.7 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nEconomic aid:\r\n  donor: ODA, $544 million (1993)\r\n\r\nCurrency: 1 Austrian schilling (S) = 100 groschen\r\n\r\nExchange rates: Austrian schillings (S) per US$1 - 10.314 (January\r\n  1996), 10.081 (1995), 11.422 (1994), 11.632 (1993), 10.989 (1992),\r\n  11.676 (1991)\r\n\r\nFiscal year: calendar year\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTransportation\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n\r\nRailways:\r\n  total: 5,624 km\r\n  standard gauge: 5,269 km 1.435-m gauge (3,263 km electrified)\r\n  narrow gauge: 355 km 1.000-m and 0.760-m gauge (86 km electrified)\r\n  (1995)\r\n\r\nHighways:\r\n  total: 108,000 km\r\n  paved: 22,000 km (including 1,800 km of expressways)\r\n  unpaved: 86,000 km (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nWaterways: 446 km\r\n\r\nPipelines: crude oil 554 km; petroleum products 171 km; natural\r\n  gas 2,611 km\r\n\r\nPorts: Linz, Vienna\r\n\r\nMerchant marine:\r\n  total: 29 ships (1,000 GRT or over) totaling 88,617 GRT/122,475 DWT\r\n  ships by type: bulk 1, cargo 23, combination bulk 2, container 1,\r\n  refrigerated cargo 2 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nAirports:\r\n  total: 55\r\n  with paved runways over 3 047 m: 1\r\n  with paved runways 2 438 to 3 047 m: 5\r\n  with paved runways 1 524 to 2 437 m: 1\r\n  with paved runways 914 to 1 523 m: 3\r\n  with paved runways under 914 m: 41\r\n  with unpaved runways 914 to 1 523 m: 4 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nHeliports: 1 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommunications\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n\r\nTelephones: 3.47 million (1986 est.)\r\n\r\nTelephone system:\r\n  domestic: highly developed and efficient\r\n  international: satellite earth stations - 2 Intelsat (1 Atlantic\r\n  Ocean and 1 Indian Ocean) and 2 Eutelsat\r\n\r\nRadio broadcast stations: AM 6, FM 21 (repeaters 545), shortwave 0\r\n\r\nRadios: NA\r\n\r\nTelevision broadcast stations: 47 (repeaters 870)\r\n\r\nTelevisions: 2,418,584 (1984 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDefense\r\n-------\r\n\r\n\r\nBranches: Army (includes Flying Division)\r\n\r\nManpower availability:\r\n  males age 15-49: 2,084,827\r\n  males fit for military service: 1,741,068\r\n  males reach military age (19) annually: 45,628 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nDefense expenditures: exchange rate conversion - $2.1 billion,\r\n  1.0% of GDP (1995)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n======================================================================\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n@Azerbaijan\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nAzerbaijan continues to be plagued by an unresolved eight-year-old\r\nconflict with Armenian separatists over its Nagorno-Karabakh region.\r\nThe Karabakh Armenians have declared independence and seized almost\r\n20% of the country's territory, creating almost 1 million Azeri\r\nrefugees in the process. Both sides have generally observed a\r\nRussian-mediated cease-fire in place since May 1994, and support the\r\nOSCE-mediated peace process, now entering its fifth year.\r\nNevertheless, Baku and Xankandi (Stepanakert, Nagorno-Karabakh\r\nregion) remain far apart on most substantive issues from the\r\nplacement and composition of a peacekeeping force to the enclave's\r\nultimate political status, and prospects for a negotiated settlement\r\nremain dim.\r\n\r\nMap\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation: 40 30 N, 47 30 E -- Southwestern Asia, bordering the\r\n  Caspian Sea, between Iran and Russia\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFlag\r\n----\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription: three equal horizontal bands of blue (top), red, and\r\n  green;

It\r\n  resembles the Central Asian states in its majority nominally Muslim\r\n  population, high structural unemployment, and low standard of\r\n  living. The economy's most prominent products are oil, cotton, and\r\n  gas. Production from the Caspian oil and gas field has been in\r\n  decline for several years, but the November 1994 ratification of the\r\n  $7.5 billion oil deal with a consortium of Western companies should\r\n  generate the funds needed to spur future industrial development.\r\n  Azerbaijan shares all the formidable problems of the ex-Soviet\r\n  republics in making the transition from a command to a market\r\n  economy, but its considerable energy resources brighten its\r\n  long-term prospects. Baku has only recently begun making progress on\r\n  economic reform, and old economic ties and structures have yet to be\r\n  replaced. Whereas the economies of most of the former Soviet\r\n  republics had begun to bottom out in 1995, Azerbaijan's economy\r\n  continued to plummet because of its late start on economic reform.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $11.5 billion (1995 estimate as\r\n  extrapolated from World Bank estimate for 1994)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: -17% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $1,480 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: NA%\r\n  industry: NA%\r\n  services: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 85% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 2.789 million\r\n  by occupation: agriculture and forestry 32%, industry and\r\n  construction 26%, other 42% (1990)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 2.3% includes officially registered unemployed;\r\n  also large numbers of unregistered unemployed and underemployed\r\n  workers (December 1995)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $465 million\r\n  expenditures: $488 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: petroleum and natural gas, petroleum products,\r\n  oilfield equipment;

Annual GDP growth has averaged over 4% in\r\n  recent years from a low base. Its economy is overwhelmingly\r\n  agricultural, with the cultivation of rice the single most important\r\n  activity in the economy. Major impediments to growth include\r\n  frequent cyclones and floods, the inefficiency of state-owned\r\n  enterprises, a rapidly growing labor force that cannot be absorbed\r\n  by agriculture, delays in exploiting energy resources (natural gas),\r\n  inadequate power supplies, and, most recently, political\r\n  disturbances. In 1995, progress on Bangladesh's development agenda\r\n  has been slowed by frequent political unrest before and after\r\n  national elections in early 1996. Opposition parties have challenged\r\n  the government's authority by resigning from Parliament and\r\n  sponsoring numerous countrywide strikes that have crippled\r\n  transport, hindered business activity, and threatened to slow\r\n  economic growth in 1996.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $144.5 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 4.6% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $1,130 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: NA%\r\n  industry: NA%\r\n  services: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 4.5% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 50.1 million\r\n  by occupation: agriculture 65%, services 21%, industry and mining\r\n  14% (1989)\r\n  note: extensive export of labor to Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Oman (1991)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $2.8 billion\r\n  expenditures: $4.1 billion, including capital expenditures of $1.8\r\n  billion (FY92/93)\r\n\r\nIndustries: jute manufacturing, cotton textiles, food processing,\r\n  steel, fertilizer\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 8.5% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 2,740,000 kW\r\n  production: 9.2 billion kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 70 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: jute, rice, wheat, tea, sugarcane, potatoes;

However, the breakup of the Soviet\r\n  Union and its traditional trade ties, as well as the government's\r\n  failure to embrace market reforms, has resulted in a sharp economic\r\n  decline. Privatization is virtually nonexistent and the system of\r\n  state orders and distribution persists. Although President\r\n  LUKASHENKO pronounces his 1995 macro stabilization policies a\r\n  success - annual inflation dropped from 2,220% in 1994 to 244% in\r\n  1995 - the IMF has criticized his insistence on maintaining the\r\n  steady exchange rate for Belarusian rubel, which has traded at\r\n  11,500 to the dollar since late 1994. The IMF suspended Minsk's $300\r\n  million standby program in November 1995 until the government would\r\n  agree to a devaluation of the rubel. The overvalued rubel has\r\n  especially hurt Belarusian exporters, most of which now operate at a\r\n  loss.

With few natural resources, Belgium must\r\n  import substantial quantities of raw materials and export a large\r\n  volume of manufactures, making its economy unusually dependent on\r\n  the state of world markets. Two-thirds of its trade is with other EU\r\n  countries. The economy grew at a strong 4% annual pace during the\r\n  period 1988-90, slowed to 1% in 1991-92, dropped by 1.5% in 1993,\r\n  and recovered with moderate 2.3% growth in 1994 and 1995.

Growth in real output, which had averaged a sound 4%\r\n  in 1990-94, rose to 6% in 1995. Rapid population growth, now 3.3%\r\n  per year, offset much of this growth in output. Inflation jumped to\r\n  55% in 1994 (compared to 3% in 1993) following the 50% currency\r\n  devaluation in January 1994, but subsided gradually in 1995.\r\n  Commercial and transport activities, which make up 37% of GDP, are\r\n  extremely vulnerable to developments in Nigeria as evidenced by\r\n  decreased reexport trade in 1994 due to a severe contraction in\r\n  Nigerian demand. Support by the Paris Club and official bilateral\r\n  creditors has eased the external debt situation in recent years. The\r\n  government, still burdened with money-losing state enterprises and a\r\n  bloated civil service, has been gradually implementing a World Bank\r\n  supported structural adjustment program since 1991.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $7.6 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 6% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $1,380 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 36.8%\r\n  industry: 12.6%\r\n  services: 50.6% (1993)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 55% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 1.9 million (1987)\r\n  by occupation: agriculture 60%, transport, commerce, and public\r\n  services 38%, industry less than 2%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $272 million (1993 est.)\r\n  expenditures: $375 million, including capital expenditures of $84\r\n  million (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: textiles, cigarettes;

The\r\n  tourist industry attracts more than 90% of its business from North\r\n  America. The industrial sector is small, and agriculture is severely\r\n  limited by a lack of suitable land. About 80% of food needs are\r\n  imported. International business contributes over 60% of Bermuda's\r\n  economic output; a failed independence vote in late 1995 can be\r\n  partially attributed to Bermudian's fear of scaring away foreign\r\n  firms. Hurricane Felix, which hit Bermuda twice over three days,\r\n  caused an estimated $2.5 million in damages in August of 1995.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $1.7 billion (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 2.5% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $28,000 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: NA%\r\n  industry: NA%\r\n  services: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 2.6% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 33,650 (1992)\r\n  by occupation: clerical 25%, services 22%, laborers 21%,\r\n  professional and technical 13%, administrative and managerial 10%,\r\n  sales 7%, agriculture and fishing 2% (1984)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NEGL% (1995)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $327.5 million\r\n  expenditures: $308.9 million, including capital expenditures of\r\n  $35.4 million (FY90/91 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: tourism, finance, structural concrete products,\r\n  paints, pharmaceuticals, ship repairing\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 140,000 kW\r\n  production: 504 million kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 7,745 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: bananas, vegetables, citrus, flowers;

Agriculture consists largely of subsistence farming and\r\n  animal husbandry. Rugged mountains dominate the terrain and make the\r\n  building of roads and other infrastructure difficult and expensive.\r\n  The economy is closely aligned with India's through strong trade and\r\n  monetary links. The industrial sector is small and technologically\r\n  backward, with most production of the cottage industry type. Most\r\n  development projects, such as road construction, rely on Indian\r\n  migrant labor. Bhutan's hydropower potential and its attraction for\r\n  tourists are key resources; however, the government limits the\r\n  number of tourists to 4,000 per year to minimize foreign influence.\r\n  The Bhutanese Government has made some progress in expanding the\r\n  nation's productive base and improving social welfare but growth\r\n  continues to be constrained by the government's desire to protect\r\n  the country's environment and cultural traditions. Growth picked up\r\n  in 1995 and the country's balance of payments remained strong with\r\n  comfortable reserves. The cautious fiscal stance planned for FY95/96\r\n  suggests continued economic stability in 1996. However, excessive\r\n  controls and uncertain policies in areas like industrial licensing,\r\n  trade, labor, and finance continue to hamper foreign investment.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $1.3 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 6% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $730 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: NA%\r\n  industry: NA%\r\n  services: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 8.6% (FY94/95 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: NA\r\n  by occupation: agriculture 93%, services 5%, industry and commerce 2%\r\n  note: massive lack of skilled labor\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $52 million\r\n  expenditures: $150 million, including capital expenditures of $95\r\n  million (FY93/94 est.)\r\n  note: the government of India finances nearly three-fifths of\r\n  Bhutan's budget expenditures\r\n\r\nIndustries: cement, wood products, processed fruits, alcoholic\r\n  beverages, calcium carbide\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 7.6% (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 360,000 kW\r\n  production: 1.7 billion kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 143 kWh (1993)\r\n  note: Bhutan exports electricity to India\r\n\r\nAgriculture: rice, corn, root crops, citrus, foodgrains;

However, Bolivia has\r\n  experienced generally improving economic conditions since the PAZ\r\n  Estenssoro administration (1985-89) introduced market-oriented\r\n  policies which reduced inflation from 11,700% in 1985 to about 20%\r\n  in 1988. PAZ Estenssoro was followed as president by Jaime PAZ\r\n  Zamora (1989-93) who continued the free-market policies of his\r\n  predecessor, despite opposition from his own party and from\r\n  Bolivia's once powerful labor movement. By maintaining fiscal\r\n  discipline, PAZ Zamora helped reduce inflation to 9.3% in 1993,\r\n  while GDP grew by an annual average of 3.25% during his tenure.\r\n  Inaugurated in August 1993, President SANCHEZ DE LOZADA has vowed to\r\n  advance the market-oriented economic reforms he helped launch as PAZ\r\n  Estenssoro's planning minister. His successes so far have included\r\n  the signing of a free trade agreement with Mexico and progress on\r\n  his unique privatization plan. The main privatization bill was\r\n  passed by the Bolivian legislature in late March 1994. Since that\r\n  time, the administration has privatized the electric power\r\n  generation sector, the state airline, the state telephone company,\r\n  and the national railroad.

The\r\nDayton Agreement, signed by Bosnian President IZETBEGOVIC, Croatian\r\nPresident TUDJMAN, and Serbian President MILOSEVIC, divides Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina roughly equally between the Muslim/Croat Federation\r\nand the Bosnian Serbs while maintaining Bosnia's currently\r\nrecognized borders. An international peacekeeping force (IFOR) of\r\n60,000 troops began to enter Bosnia in late 1995 to implement and\r\nmonitor the military aspects of the agreement and is scheduled to\r\ndepart the country within one year. A High Representative appointed\r\nby the UN Security Council is responsible for civilian\r\nimplementation of the accord, including monitoring implementation,\r\nfacilitating any difficulties arising in connection with civilian\r\nimplementation, and coordinating activities of the civilian\r\norganizations and agencies in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Bosnian\r\nconflict began in the spring of 1992 when the Government of Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina held a referendum on independence and the Bosnian\r\nSerbs - supported by neighboring Serbia - responded with armed\r\nresistance aimed at partitioning the republic along ethnic lines and\r\njoining Serb-held areas to form a \"greater Serbia.\" In March 1994,\r\nBosnia's Muslims and Croats reduced the number of warring factions\r\nfrom three to two by signing an agreement in Washington creating\r\ntheir joint Muslim/Croat Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\n\r\nMap\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation: 44 00 N, 18 00 E -- Southeastern Europe, bordering the\r\n  Adriatic Sea and Croatia\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFlag\r\n----\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription: white with a large blue shield; the shield contains\r\n  white fleurs-de-lis with a white diagonal band running from the\r\n  upper hoist corner to the lower outer side\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeography\r\n---------\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation: Southeastern Europe, bordering the Adriatic Sea and\r\n  Croatia\r\n\r\nGeographic coordinates: 44 00 N, 18 00 E\r\n\r\nMap references: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Europe\r\n\r\nArea:\r\n  total area: 51,233 sq km\r\n  land area: 51,233 sq km\r\n  comparative area: slightly smaller than West Virginia\r\n\r\nLand boundaries:\r\n  total: 1,459 km\r\n  border countries: Croatia 932 km, Serbia and Montenegro 527 km (312\r\n  km with Serbia, 215 km with Montenegro)\r\n\r\nCoastline: 20 km\r\n\r\nMaritime claims: NA\r\n\r\nInternational disputes: none\r\n\r\nClimate: hot summers and cold winters; areas of high elevation\r\n  have short, cool summers and long, severe winters; mild, rainy\r\n  winters along coast\r\n\r\nTerrain: mountains and valleys\r\n  lowest point: Adriatic Sea 0 m\r\n  highest point: Maglic 2,386 m\r\n\r\nNatural resources: coal, iron, bauxite, manganese, forests,\r\n  copper, chromium, lead, zinc\r\n\r\nLand use:\r\n  arable land: 20%\r\n  permanent crops: 2%\r\n  meadows and pastures: 25%\r\n  forest and woodland: 36%\r\n  other: 17%\r\n\r\nIrrigated land: NA sq km\r\n\r\nEnvironment:\r\n  current issues: air pollution from metallurgical plants; sites for\r\n  disposing of urban waste are limited; widespread casualties, water\r\n  shortages, and destruction of infrastructure because of civil strife\r\n  natural hazards: frequent and destructive earthquakes\r\n  international agreements: party to - Air Pollution, Law of the Sea,\r\n  Marine Dumping, Marine Life Conservation, Nuclear Test Ban, Ozone\r\n  Layer Protection\r\n\r\nGeographic note: as of January 1996, Bosnian Serb leaders\r\n  continued to demand revisions to the territorial aspects of the\r\n  Dayton Agreement, especially in Sarajevo - designated to be under\r\n  Federation control - and the Brcko/Posavina corridor area; members\r\n  of the Bosnian Croat community also reject several territorial\r\n  aspects of the agreement, citing that historically Bosnian Croat\r\n  lands are to be transferred to Bosnian Serb control; despite\r\n  disagreements, initial implementation of the agreement as of January\r\n  1996 appeared on course with the warring parties meeting the\r\n  deadline for withdrawal of forces from the front lines in Sarajevo\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPeople\r\n------\r\n\r\n\r\nPopulation: 2,656,240 (July 1996 est.)\r\n  note: all data dealing with population is subject to considerable\r\n  error because of the dislocations caused by military action and\r\n  ethnic cleansing\r\n\r\nAge structure:\r\n  0-14 years: 20% (male 276,530; female 248,519)\r\n  15-64 years: 68% (male 892,807; female 915,686)\r\n  65 years and over: 12% (male 133,081; female 189,617) (July 1996\r\n  est.)\r\n\r\nPopulation growth rate: -2.84% (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nBirth rate: 6.34 births/1,000 population (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nDeath rate: 15.92 deaths/1,000 population (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nNet migration rate: -18.82 migrant(s)/1,000 population (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nSex ratio:\r\n  at birth: 1.07 male(s)/female\r\n  under 15 years: 1.11 male(s)/female\r\n  15-64 years: 0.98 male(s)/female\r\n  65 years and over: 0.7 male(s)/female\r\n  all ages: 0.96 male(s)/female (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nInfant mortality rate: 43.2 deaths/1,000 live births (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nLife expectancy at birth:\r\n  total population: 56.11 years\r\n  male: 51.16 years\r\n  female: 61.39 years (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nTotal fertility rate: 1 children born/woman (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nNationality:\r\n  noun: Bosnian(s), Herzegovinian(s)\r\n  adjective: Bosnian, Herzegovinian\r\n\r\nEthnic divisions: Serb 40%, Muslim 38%, Croat 22% (est.)\r\n\r\nReligions: Muslim 40%, Orthodox 31%, Catholic 15%, Protestant 4%,\r\n  other 10%\r\n\r\nLanguages: Serbo-Croatian 99%\r\n\r\nLiteracy: NA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment note: The US recognizes the Republic of Bosnia and\r\n  Herzegovina.

Although agriculture has been almost all in\r\n  private hands, farms have been small and inefficient, and the\r\n  republic traditionally has been a net importer of food. Industry has\r\n  been greatly overstaffed, one reflection of the rigidities of\r\n  communist central planning and management. TITO had pushed the\r\n  development of military industries in the republic with the result\r\n  that Bosnia hosted a large share of Yugoslavia's defense plants. The\r\n  bitter interethnic warfare in Bosnia caused production to plummet,\r\n  unemployment and inflation to soar, and human misery to multiply. No\r\n  economic statistics for 1992-95 are available, although output\r\n  clearly has fallen substantially below the levels of earlier years\r\n  and almost certainly is well below $1,000 per head. The country\r\n  receives substantial amounts of humanitarian aid from the\r\n  international community.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $1 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $300 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: NA%\r\n  industry: NA%\r\n  services: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): NA%\r\n\r\nLabor force: 1,026,254\r\n  by occupation: NA%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $NA\r\n  expenditures: $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n\r\nIndustries: steel, coal, iron ore, lead, zinc, manganese, bauxite,\r\n  vehicle assembly, textiles, tobacco products, wooden furniture, tank\r\n  and aircraft assembly, domestic appliances, oil refining;

Agriculture today provides a livelihood\r\n  for more than 80% of the population but supplies only about 50% of\r\n  food needs and accounts for only 5% of GDP. Subsistence farming and\r\n  cattle raising predominate. The sector is plagued by erratic\r\n  rainfall and poor soils. The driving force behind the rapid economic\r\n  growth of the 1970s and 1980s has been the mining industry. This\r\n  sector, mostly on the strength of diamonds, has gone from generating\r\n  25% of GDP in 1980 to 39% in 1994. The unemployment rate remains a\r\n  problem at 21%. Hampered by a still sluggish diamond market in 1994\r\n  and 1995, GDP grew by only 1% in both years.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $4.5 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 1% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $3,200 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 5%\r\n  industry: NA%\r\n  services: NA% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 10% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 428,000 (1992)\r\n  by occupation: 220,000 formal sector employees; 14,300 are employed\r\n  in various mines in South Africa; most others are engaged in cattle\r\n  raising and subsistence agriculture (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 21% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $1.7 billion\r\n  expenditures: $1.99 billion, including capital expenditures of $652\r\n  million (FY93/94)\r\n\r\nIndustries: diamonds, copper, nickel, coal, salt, soda ash,\r\n  potash;

Prior to the institution of a\r\n  stabilization plan in mid-1994, stratospheric inflation rates had\r\n  devastated the economy and discouraged foreign investment. Since\r\n  then, tight monetary policy has apparently brought inflation under\r\n  control - consumer prices increased by 23% in 1995 compared to more\r\n  than 1,000% in 1994. At the same time, GDP growth slowed from 5.7%\r\n  to 4.2% as credit was tightened and the steadily appreciating real\r\n  encouraged imports while depressing export growth. The increased\r\n  stability of the Brazilian economy allowed it to weather the fallout\r\n  from the Mexican peso crisis relatively well, with foreign funds\r\n  flowing in during the second half of 1995 to swell official foreign\r\n  exchange reserves past the $50 billion mark. Stock market indices in\r\n  Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, however, ended 26% lower in 1995.\r\n  President CARDOSO remains committed to further reducing inflation in\r\n  1996 while boosting growth, but he faces key challenges. Servicing\r\n  domestic debt has become dramatically more burdensome for both\r\n  public and private sector entities because of very high real\r\n  interest rates which are contributing to growing budget deficits and\r\n  a surge in bankruptcies. Fiscal reforms, many of which require\r\n  constitutional amendments, are proceeding at a slow pace through the\r\n  Brazilian legislature; in their absence, the government is\r\n  maintaining its strict monetary policy. Brazil's natural resources\r\n  remain a major, long-run economic strength.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $976.8 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 4.2% (1995)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $6,100 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 16%\r\n  industry: 25%\r\n  services: 59% (1994)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 23% (1995)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 57 million (1989 est.)\r\n  by occupation: services 42%, agriculture 31%, industry 27%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 5% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $58.7 billion\r\n  expenditures: $54.9 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1994)\r\n\r\nIndustries: textiles, shoes, chemicals, cement, lumber, iron ore,\r\n  tin, steel, aircraft, motor vehicles and parts, other machinery and\r\n  equipment\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 3.5% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 55,130,000 kW\r\n  production: 241.4 billion kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 1,589 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: coffee, soybeans, wheat, rice, corn, sugarcane,\r\n  cocoa, citrus;

In 1985, the government began\r\n  offering offshore registration to companies wishing to incorporate\r\n  in the islands, and incorporation fees now generate substantial\r\n  revenues. The adoption of a comprehensive insurance law in late\r\n  1994, which provides a blanket of confidentiality with regulated\r\n  statutory gateways for investigation of criminal offenses, is\r\n  expected to make the British Virgin Islands even more attractive to\r\n  international business. Livestock raising is the most important\r\n  agricultural activity; poor soils limit the islands' ability to meet\r\n  domestic food requirements. Because of traditional close links with\r\n  the US Virgin Islands, the British Virgin Islands have used the\r\n  dollar as their currency since 1959.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $133 million (1991 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 2% (1991 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $10,600 (1991 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: NA%\r\n  industry: NA%\r\n  services: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 2.5% (1990 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 4,911 (1980)\r\n  by occupation: NA\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NEGL% (1992)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $77.1 million\r\n  expenditures: $76.4 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (FY93/94)\r\n\r\nIndustries: tourism, light industry, construction, rum, concrete\r\n  block, offshore financial center\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 4% (1985)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 10,500 kW\r\n  production: 50 million kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 3,148 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: fruits, vegetables;

GDP rose a\r\n  moderate 2.4% in 1995; inflation was down sharply; and unemployment\r\n  fell from an estimated 16% to 12%. Despite this progress, structural\r\n  reforms necessary to underpin macroeconomic stabilization were not\r\n  pursued vigorously. Mass privatization of state-owned industry\r\n  continued to move slowly, although privatization of small-scale\r\n  industry, particularly in the retail and service sectors,\r\n  accelerated. The Bulgarian economy will continue to grow in 1996,\r\n  but economic reforms will remain politically difficult as the\r\n  population has become weary of the process.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $43.2 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 2.4% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $4,920 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 12%\r\n  industry: 36%\r\n  services: 52% (1994)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 35% (1995)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 3.1 million\r\n  by occupation: industry 41%, agriculture 18%, other 41% (1992)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 11.9% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $3.8 billion\r\n  expenditures: $4.4 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1994)\r\n\r\nIndustries: machine building and metal working, food processing,\r\n  chemicals, textiles, construction materials, ferrous and nonferrous\r\n  metals\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 2% (1995)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 11,500,000 kW\r\n  production: 38.1 billion kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 4,342 kWh (1994)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: grain, oilseed, vegetables, fruits, tobacco;

Economic\r\n  development is hindered by a poor communications network within a\r\n  landlocked country.

Following the Communaute Financiere Africaine currency\r\n  devaluation on 12 January 1994, exports appear to have risen, but no\r\n  official figures have been released yet. The upswing apparently\r\n  continued in 1995, with growth perhaps at 4%.

Government policy in the\r\n  last seven years, 1989-95, has aimed at revitalizing the economy\r\n  after three decades of tight central planning. Thus, private\r\n  activity has markedly increased; foreign investment has been\r\n  encouraged, so far with moderate success; and efforts continue to\r\n  increase the efficiency of state enterprises. Published estimates of\r\n  Burma's foreign trade are greatly understated because of the volume\r\n  of black market trade. A major ongoing problem is the failure to\r\n  achieve monetary and fiscal stability. Although Burma remains a poor\r\n  Asian country, its rich resources furnish the potential for\r\n  substantial long-term increases in income, exports, and living\r\n  standards.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $47 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 6.8% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $1,000 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 60%\r\n  industry: 10%\r\n  services: 30% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 38% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 16.007 million (1992)\r\n  by occupation: agriculture 65.2%, industry 14.3%, trade 10.1%,\r\n  government 6.3%, other 4.1% (FY88/89 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $5.3 billion\r\n  expenditures: $10 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: agricultural processing;

The economy is\r\n  predominately agricultural with roughly 90% of the population\r\n  dependent on subsistence agriculture. Its economic health depends on\r\n  the coffee crop, which accounts for 80% of foreign exchange\r\n  earnings. The ability to pay for imports therefore rests largely on\r\n  the vagaries of the climate and the international coffee market. As\r\n  part of its economic reform agenda, launched in February 1991 with\r\n  IMF and World Bank support, Burundi is trying to diversify its\r\n  agricultural exports, attract foreign investment in industry, and\r\n  modernize government budgetary practices. Since October 1993 the\r\n  nation has suffered from massive ethnic-based violence which has\r\n  resulted in the death of perhaps 100,000 persons and the\r\n  displacement of a million others; production has fallen sharply, and\r\n  an impoverished and disorganized government can hardly implement\r\n  these needed reform programs.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $4 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 2.7% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $600 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 54.1%\r\n  industry: 16.8%\r\n  services: 29.1% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 10% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 1.9 million (1983 est.)\r\n  by occupation: agriculture 93.0%, government 4.0%, industry and\r\n  commerce 1.5%, services 1.5%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $318 million\r\n  expenditures: $326 million, including capital expenditures of $150\r\n  million (1991 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: light consumer goods such as blankets, shoes, soap;\r\n  assembly of imported components;

Government leaders are moving\r\n  toward restoring fiscal and monetary discipline and have established\r\n  good working relations with international financial institutions.\r\n  Growth, starting from a low base, has been strong in 1991-95.\r\n  Despite such positive developments, the reconstruction effort faces\r\n  many tough challenges because of the persistence of internal\r\n  political divisions and the related lack of confidence of foreign\r\n  investors. Rural Cambodia, where 90% of about 9.5 million Khmer\r\n  live, remains mired in poverty. The almost total lack of basic\r\n  infrastructure in the countryside will hinder development and will\r\n  contribute to a growing imbalance in growth between urban and rural\r\n  areas over the near term. Moreover, the government's lack of\r\n  experience in administering economic and technical assistance\r\n  programs and rampant corruption among officials will slow the growth\r\n  of critical public sector investment. The decline of inflation from\r\n  the 1992 rate of more than 50% is one of the bright spots.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $7 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 6.7% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $660 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 52%\r\n  industry: 13.5%\r\n  services: 34.5% (1993)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 6% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 2.5 million to 3 million\r\n  by occupation: agriculture 80% (1988 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $210 million\r\n  expenditures: $346 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: rice milling, fishing, wood and wood products, rubber,\r\n  cement, gem mining\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 7.9% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 40,000 kW\r\n  production: 160 million kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 14 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: rice, rubber, corn, vegetables\r\n\r\nIllicit drugs: key transshipment country for Golden Triangle\r\n  heroin en route to West;

Still, it faces many of the serious problems\r\n  facing other underdeveloped countries, such as political\r\n  instability, a top-heavy civil service, and a generally unfavorable\r\n  climate for business enterprise. The development of the oil sector\r\n  led to rapid economic growth between 1970 and 1985. Growth came to\r\n  an abrupt halt in 1986, precipitated by steep declines in the prices\r\n  of major exports: coffee, cocoa, and petroleum. Export earnings were\r\n  cut by almost one-third, and inefficiencies in fiscal management\r\n  were exposed. In 1990-93, with support from the IMF and World Bank,\r\n  the government began to introduce reforms designed to spur business\r\n  investment, increase efficiency in agriculture, and recapitalize the\r\n  nation's banks. Political instability, following suspect elections\r\n  in 1992, brought IMF/WB structural adjustment to a halt; currently\r\n  Cameroon receives only minimal assistance from those Bretton Woods\r\n  institutions. Although the 50% devaluation of the currency of 12\r\n  January 1994 improved the potential for export growth, mismanagement\r\n  remains the main barrier to economic improvement.

Since\r\n  World War II, the impressive growth of the manufacturing, mining,\r\n  and service sectors has transformed the nation from a largely rural\r\n  economy into one primarily industrial and urban. Canada started the\r\n  1990s in recession, and real rates of growth have averaged only 1.1%\r\n  so far this decade. Because of slower growth, Canada still faces\r\n  high unemployment and a large public sector debt. With its great\r\n  natural resources, skilled labor force, and modern capital plant,\r\n  however, Canada will enjoy better economic prospects in the future.\r\n  The continuing constitutional impasse between English- and\r\n  French-speaking areas is raising the possibility of a split in the\r\n  confederation, making foreign investors somewhat edgy.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $694 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 2.1% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $24,400 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 2%\r\n  industry: 26%\r\n  services: 72% (1994)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 2.4% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 13.38 million\r\n  by occupation: services 75%, manufacturing 14%, agriculture 4%,\r\n  construction 3%, other 4% (1988)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 9.5% (1995)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $90.4 billion\r\n  expenditures: $114.1 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (FY94/95 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: processed and unprocessed minerals, food products,\r\n  wood and paper products, transportation equipment, chemicals, fish\r\n  products, petroleum and natural gas\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 5.9% (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 108,090,000 kW\r\n  production: 511 billion kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 16,133 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: wheat, barley, oilseed, tobacco, fruits, vegetables;\r\n  dairy products;

The economy is service\r\n  oriented, with commerce, transport, and public services accounting\r\n  for 60% of GDP. Although nearly 70% of the population lives in rural\r\n  areas, the share of agriculture in GNP is only 13%, of which fishing\r\n  accounts for 4%. About 90% of food must be imported. The fishing\r\n  potential, mostly lobster and tuna, is not fully exploited. Cape\r\n  Verde annually runs a high trade deficit, financed by remittances\r\n  from emigrants and foreign aid, which form important supplements to\r\n  GDP. Economic reforms, launched by the new democratic government in\r\n  1991, are aimed at developing the private sector and attracting\r\n  foreign investment to diversify the economy. Prospects for 1996\r\n  depend heavily on the maintenance of aid flows, remittances, and the\r\n  momentum of the government's development program.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $440 million (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 4.6% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $1,040 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 13%\r\n  industry: 17%\r\n  services: 70% (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 5% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 102,000 (1985 est.)\r\n  by occupation: agriculture (mostly subsistence) 57%, services 29%,\r\n  industry 14% (1981)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 35% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $174 million\r\n  expenditures: $235 million, including capital expenditures of $165\r\n  million (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: fish processing, salt mining, garments, ship repair,\r\n  food and beverages\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 15,000 kW\r\n  production: 40 million kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 73 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: bananas, corn, beans, sweet potatoes, sugarcane,\r\n  coffee, peanuts;

The agricultural sector generates half of GDP.\r\n  Timber has accounted for about 13% of export earnings and the\r\n  diamond industry for nearly 80%. Important constraints to economic\r\n  development include the CAR's landlocked position, a poor\r\n  transportation system, a largely unskilled work force, and a legacy\r\n  of misdirected macroeconomic policies. A major plus is the large\r\n  forest reserves, which the government is moving to protect from\r\n  overexploitation. The 50% devaluation of the currencies of 14\r\n  Francophone African nations on 12 January 1994 had mixed effects on\r\n  the CAR's economy. While diamond, timber, coffee, and cotton exports\r\n  increased - leading GDP to increase by 5.5% - inflation rose to 45%,\r\n  fueled by the rising prices of imports on which the economy depends;\r\n  inflation dropped back rapidly in 1995. The CAR's poor resource base\r\n  and primitive infrastructure will keep it dependent on multilateral\r\n  donors and France for the foreseeable future.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $2.5 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 4.1% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $800 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 50%\r\n  industry: 14%\r\n  services: 36% (1993)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 45% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 775,413 (1986 est.)\r\n  by occupation: agriculture 85%, commerce and services 9%, industry\r\n  3%, government 3%\r\n  note: about 64,000 salaried workers (1985)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $NA\r\n  expenditures: $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n\r\nIndustries: diamond mining, sawmills, breweries, textiles,\r\n  footwear, assembly of bicycles and motorcycles\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 40,000 kW\r\n  production: 100 million kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 29 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: cotton, coffee, tobacco, manioc (tapioca), yams,\r\n  millet, corn, bananas;

Its economy is hobbled by\r\n  political turmoil, drought, and food shortages. Consequently the\r\n  economy has shown little progress in recent years in overcoming a\r\n  severe setback brought on by civil war in the late 1980s. More than\r\n  80% of the work force is involved in subsistence farming and\r\n  fishing. Cotton is the major cash crop, accounting for at least half\r\n  of exports. Chad is highly dependent on foreign aid, especially food\r\n  credits, given chronic shortages in several regions. Of all the\r\n  Francophone countries in Africa, Chad has benefited the least from\r\n  the 50% devaluation of their currencies on 12 January 1994. Despite\r\n  an increase in external financial aid and favorable price increases\r\n  for cotton - the primary source of foreign exchange - the corrupt\r\n  and enfeebled government bureaucracy continues to postpone payment\r\n  of public sector salaries and to dampen economic enterprise by\r\n  neglecting payments to domestic suppliers. The devaluation resulted\r\n  in stepped-up inflation of 41% in 1994; in contrast to other\r\n  Francophone countries, Chad continued to suffer high inflation in\r\n  1995 because of the government's lack of financial discipline. Oil\r\n  production in the Lake Chad area remains a distant prospect and the\r\n  subsistence-driven economy probably will continue to limp along in\r\n  the near term.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $3.3 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 4% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $600 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 49%\r\n  industry: 17%\r\n  services: 34%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 41% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: NA\r\n  by occupation: agriculture 85% (subsistence farming, herding, and\r\n  fishing)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $120 million\r\n  expenditures: $363 million, including capital expenditures of $104\r\n  million (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: cotton textiles, meat packing, beer brewing, natron\r\n  (sodium carbonate), soap, cigarettes, construction materials\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 40,000 kW\r\n  production: 80 million kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 13 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: cotton, sorghum, millet, peanuts, rice, potatoes,\r\n  manioc (tapioca);

Under the\r\n  center-left government of President AYLWIN, which took power in\r\n  March 1990, spending on social welfare rose steadily. At the same\r\n  time business investment, exports, and consumer spending also grew\r\n  substantially. The new president, FREI, who took office in March\r\n  1994, has emphasized social spending even more. Growth in real GDP\r\n  in 1991-95 has averaged more than 6.5% annually, with an estimated\r\n  one million Chileans having moved out of poverty in the last four\r\n  years. Copper remains vital to the health of the economy; Chile is\r\n  the world's largest producer and exporter of copper. Success in\r\n  meeting the government's goal of sustained annual economic growth of\r\n  5% depends on world copper prices, the level of confidence of\r\n  foreign investors and creditors, and the government's own ability to\r\n  maintain a conservative fiscal stance.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $113.2 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 8.5% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $8,000 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 7.4%\r\n  industry: 36.4%\r\n  services: 56.2% (1985)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 8.1% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 4.728 million\r\n  by occupation: services 38.3% (includes government 12%), industry\r\n  and commerce 33.8%, agriculture, forestry, and fishing 19.2%, mining\r\n  2.3%, construction 6.4% (1990)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 5.4% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $17 billion\r\n  expenditures: $17 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: copper, other minerals, foodstuffs, fish processing,\r\n  iron and steel, wood and wood products, transport equipment, cement,\r\n  textiles\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 4.3% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 4,810,000 kW\r\n  production: 22 billion kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 1,499 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: wheat, corn, grapes, beans, sugar beets, potatoes,\r\n  fruit;

The result has been a strong\r\n  surge in production. Agricultural output doubled in the 1980s, and\r\n  industry also posted major gains, especially in coastal areas near\r\n  Hong Kong and opposite Taiwan, where foreign investment and modern\r\n  production methods helped spur output of both domestic and export\r\n  goods. GDP has more than tripled since 1978. On the darker side, the\r\n  leadership has often experienced in its hybrid system the worst\r\n  results of socialism (bureaucracy, lassitude, corruption) and of\r\n  capitalism (windfall gains and stepped-up inflation). Beijing thus\r\n  has periodically backtracked, retightening central controls at\r\n  intervals. In 1992-95 annual growth of GDP accelerated, particularly\r\n  in the coastal areas - averaging more than 10% annually according to\r\n  official figures. In late 1993 China's leadership approved\r\n  additional long-term reforms aimed at giving still more play to\r\n  market-oriented institutions and at strengthening the center's\r\n  control over the financial system; state enterprises would continue\r\n  to dominate many key industries in what was now termed \"a socialist\r\n  market economy.\" In 1995 inflation dropped sharply, reflecting\r\n  tighter monetary policies and stronger measures to control food\r\n  prices. At the same time, the government struggled to (a) collect\r\n  revenues due from provinces, businesses, and individuals; (b) reduce\r\n  extortion and other economic crimes; and (c) keep afloat the large\r\n  state-owned enterprises, most of which had not participated in the\r\n  vigorous expansion of the economy. From 60 to 100 million surplus\r\n  rural workers are adrift between the villages and the cities, many\r\n  subsisting through part-time low-pay jobs. Popular resistance,\r\n  changes in central policy, and loss of authority by rural cadres\r\n  have weakened China's population control program, which is essential\r\n  to the nation's long-term economic viability. One of the most\r\n  dangerous long-term threats to continued rapid economic growth is\r\n  the deterioration in the environment, notably air pollution, soil\r\n  erosion, and the steady fall of the water table especially in the\r\n  north. The amount of arable land continues to decline because of\r\n  erosion and economic development, the cumulative loss since the\r\n  Communist takeover in 1949 being more than 15%. The next few years\r\n  will witness increasing tensions between a highly centralized\r\n  political system and an increasingly decentralized economic system.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $3.5 trillion (1995 estimate as\r\n  extrapolated from World Bank estimate with use of official Chinese\r\n  growth figures for 1993-95;

Gross domestic product (GDP)\r\n  has expanded every year for more than 25 years, and unlike many\r\n  other South American countries, Colombia did not default on any of\r\n  its official debts during the \"lost decade\" of the 1980s. Since\r\n  1990, when Bogota introduced a comprehensive reform program that\r\n  opened the economy to foreign trade and investment, GDP growth has\r\n  averaged more than 4% annually. Growth has been fueled in recent\r\n  years by the expansion of the construction and financial service\r\n  industries and an influx of foreign capital. Some foreign investors\r\n  have been deterred by an inadequate energy and transportation\r\n  infrastructure and the violence stemming from drug trafficking and\r\n  persistent rural guerrilla warfare, but direct foreign investment,\r\n  especially in the oil industry, is still rising at a rapid rate.\r\n  Although oil consequently is overtaking coffee as the main legal\r\n  export, earnings from illicit drugs probably exceed those from any\r\n  other export. Non-petroleum economic growth has been slowing,\r\n  however, in part because the tight monetary policies adopted to\r\n  offset the inflationary impact of high capital inflows and rising\r\n  government spending have slowed local sales and investment. Business\r\n  confidence also has been damaged by a political crisis stemming from\r\n  allegations that senior government officials, including President\r\n  SAMPER, solicited contributions from drug traffickers during the\r\n  1994 election campaign. The slowdown in the growth of\r\n  labor-intensive industries such as manufacturing has caused a small\r\n  rise in unemployment and interfered with President SAMPER'S plans to\r\n  lower the country's poverty rate, which has remained at about 40%\r\n  despite the expanding economy. Nevertheless, the booming oil sector,\r\n  growing foreign investment, and the fundamental stability of the\r\n  economy promise to keep growth positive for the foreseeable future,\r\n  barring severe, unpredictable shocks from developments in the\r\n  political or international arenas.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $192.5 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 5.3% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $5,300 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 21.5%\r\n  industry: 29%\r\n  services: 49.5%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 19.5% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 12 million (1990)\r\n  by occupation: services 46%, agriculture 30%, industry 24% (1990)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 9.5% (1995)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $NA\r\n  expenditures: $24 billion including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: textiles, food processing, oil, clothing and footwear,\r\n  beverages, chemicals, cement;

It contributes 40% to GDP, employs\r\n  80% of the labor force, and provides most of the exports. The\r\n  country is not self-sufficient in food production; rice, the main\r\n  staple, accounts for 90% of imports. The government is struggling to\r\n  upgrade education and technical training, to privatize commercial\r\n  and industrial enterprises, to improve health services, to diversify\r\n  exports, and to reduce the high population growth rate. Continued\r\n  foreign support is essential if the goal of 4% annual GDP growth is\r\n  to be reached in the late 1990s.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $370 million (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 0.9% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $700 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: NA%\r\n  industry: NA%\r\n  services: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 15% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 140,000 (1982)\r\n  by occupation: agriculture 80%, government 3%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 15.8% (1989)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $83 million\r\n  expenditures: $92 million, including capital expenditures of $32\r\n  million (1992)\r\n\r\nIndustries: tourism, perfume distillation, textiles, furniture,\r\n  jewelry, construction materials, soft drinks\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: -6.5% (1989 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 16,000 kW\r\n  production: 17 million kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 27 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: vanilla, cloves, perfume essences, copra, coconuts,\r\n  bananas, cassava (tapioca)\r\n\r\nExports: $13.7 million (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\n  commodities: vanilla, ylang-ylang, cloves, perfume oil, copra\r\n  partners: US 44%, France 40%, Germany 6%, Africa 5% (1992)\r\n\r\nImports: $40.9 million (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\r\n  commodities: rice and other foodstuffs, petroleum products, cement,\r\n  consumer goods\r\n  partners: France 34%, South Africa 14%, Kenya 8%, Japan 4% (1992)\r\n\r\nExternal debt: $160 million (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nEconomic aid:\r\n  recipient: ODA, $NA\r\n\r\nCurrency: 1 Comoran franc (CF) = 100 centimes\r\n\r\nExchange rates: Comoran francs (CF) per US$1 - 375.42 (January\r\n  1996), 374.36 (1995), 416.40 (1994), 283.16 (1993), 264.69 (1992),\r\n  282.11 (1991)\r\n  note: beginning 12 January 1994, the Comoran franc was devalued to\r\n  75 per French franc from 50 per French franc at which it had been\r\n  fixed since 1948\r\n\r\nFiscal year: calendar year\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTransportation\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n\r\nRailways: 0 km\r\n\r\nHighways:\r\n  total: 1,104 km\r\n  paved: 400 km\r\n  unpaved: 704 km (1988 est.)\r\n\r\nPorts: Fomboni, Moroni, Mutsamudu\r\n\r\nMerchant marine: none\r\n\r\nAirports:\r\n  total: 4\r\n  with paved runways 2 438 to 3 047 m: 1\r\n  with paved runways 914 to 1 523 m: 3 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommunications\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n\r\nTelephones: 3,770 (1991 est.)\r\n\r\nTelephone system: sparse system of microwave radio relay and HF\r\n  radiotelephone communication stations\r\n  domestic: HF radiotelephone communications and microwave radio relay\r\n  international: HF radiotelephone communications to Madagascar and\r\n  Reunion\r\n\r\nRadio broadcast stations: AM 2, FM 1, shortwave 0\r\n\r\nRadios: NA\r\n\r\nTelevision broadcast stations: 0\r\n\r\nTelevisions: 200 (1991 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDefense\r\n-------\r\n\r\n\r\nBranches: Comoran Security Force\r\n\r\nManpower availability:\r\n  males age 15-49: 121,854\r\n  males fit for military service: 72,873 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nDefense expenditures: $NA, NA% of GDP\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n======================================================================\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n@Congo\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMap\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation: 1 00 S, 15 00 E -- Western Africa, bordering the South\r\n  Atlantic Ocean, between Angola and Gabon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFlag\r\n----\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription: divided diagonally from the lower hoist side by a\r\n  yellow band;

Oil has supplanted forestry as the\r\n  mainstay of the economy, providing about 90% of government revenues\r\n  and exports. In the early 1980s, rapidly rising oil revenues enabled\r\n  Congo to finance large-scale development projects with GDP growth\r\n  averaging 5% annually, one of the highest rates in Africa.\r\n  Subsequently, falling oil prices cut GDP growth by half.

The\r\n  major export earners are fruit, copra, and clothing. Manufacturing\r\n  activities are limited to a fruit-processing plant and several\r\n  clothing factories. Economic development is hindered by the\r\n  isolation of the islands from foreign markets and a lack of natural\r\n  resources and good transportation links. A large trade deficit is\r\n  annually made up for by remittances from emigrants and by foreign\r\n  aid, largely from New Zealand. Current economic development plans\r\n  call for exploiting the tourism potential and expanding the mining\r\n  and fishing industries. Despite these plans, the Cook Islands will\r\n  continue to face severe financial problems.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $57 million (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $3,000 (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: NA%\r\n  industry: NA%\r\n  services: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 6.2% (1990)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 5,810\r\n  by occupation: agriculture 29%, government 27%, services 25%,\r\n  industry 15%, other 4% (1981)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $NA\r\n  expenditures: $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n\r\nIndustries: fruit processing, tourism\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 14,000 kW\r\n  production: 21 million kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 741 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: copra, citrus, pineapples, tomatoes, bananas, yams,\r\n  taro\r\n\r\nExports: $3.4 million (f.o.b., 1990)\r\n  commodities: copra, fresh and canned fruit, clothing\r\n  partners: NZ 80%, Japan\r\n\r\nImports: $50 million (c.i.f., 1990)\r\n  commodities: foodstuffs, textiles, fuels, timber\r\n  partners: NZ 49%, Japan, Australia, US\r\n\r\nExternal debt: $160 million (1994)\r\n\r\nEconomic aid:\r\n  recipient: ODA, $NA\r\n  note: in 1994, Cook Islands received $5.4 million in budget support\r\n  and $3.3 million in project aid from New Zealand, the country's\r\n  largest source of aid\r\n\r\nCurrency: 1 New Zealand dollar (NZ$) = 100 cents\r\n\r\nExchange rates: New Zealand dollars (NZ$) per US$1 - 1.5138\r\n  (January 1996), 1.5235 (1995), 1.6844 (1994), 1.8495 (1993), 1.8584\r\n  (1992), 1.7265 (1991)\r\n\r\nFiscal year: 1 April - 31 March\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTransportation\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n\r\nRailways: 0 km\r\n\r\nHighways:\r\n  total: 187 km\r\n  paved: 35 km\r\n  unpaved: 152 km (1980 est.)\r\n\r\nPorts: Avarua, Avatiu\r\n\r\nMerchant marine:\r\n  total: 1 cargo ship (1,000 GRT or over) totaling 1,464 GRT/2,181 DWT\r\n  (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nAirports:\r\n  total: 7\r\n  with paved runways 1 524 to 2 437 m: 1\r\n  with unpaved runways 1 524 to 2 437 m: 3\r\n  with unpaved runways 914 to 1 523 m: 3 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommunications\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n\r\nTelephones: 4,180 (1994)\r\n\r\nTelephone system:\r\n  domestic: the individual islands are connected by a combination of\r\n  satellite earth stations, microwave systems, and VHF and HF\r\n  radiotelephone;

Recent trends have been\r\n  disappointing. Economic growth slipped from 4.3% in 1994 to 2.5% in\r\n  1995, the lowest rate of growth since 1991's 2.1%. Inflation rose\r\n  dramatically to 22.5% from 13.5% in 1994, well above the\r\n  government's own projection of 18%. Unemployment rose from 4.0% in\r\n  1994 to 5.2% in 1995, and substantial underemployment continues.\r\n  These economic woes are likely to be exacerbated in 1996 by a\r\n  standby arrangement reached with the IMF on 29 November 1995. To\r\n  restore fiscal balance, the government agreed to curb inflation,\r\n  reduce the fiscal deficit, increase domestic savings, and improve\r\n  public sector efficiency while increasing the role of the private\r\n  sector.

After\r\n  several years of lagging performance, the Ivorian economy began a\r\n  comeback in 1994, due to improved prices for cocoa and coffee,\r\n  growth in nontraditional primary exports such as pineapples and\r\n  rubber, trade and banking liberalization, offshore oil and gas\r\n  discoveries, and generous external financing and debt rescheduling\r\n  by multilateral lenders and France. The 50% devaluation of Franc\r\n  Zone currencies on 12 January 1994 caused a one-time jump in the\r\n  inflation rate to 32% for 1994, but this rate fell to perhaps 10% in\r\n  1995, in part as the economy adjusted to the devaluation. Moreover,\r\n  government adherence to donor-mandated reforms led to a budget\r\n  surplus in 1994. Real growth of GDP in 1994 was 1.7%, a significant\r\n  improvement following several years of negative growth.

Croatia faces considerable economic\r\n  problems stemming from: the legacy of longtime communist\r\n  mismanagement of the economy; large foreign debt; damage during the\r\n  internecine fighting to bridges, factories, power lines, buildings,\r\n  and houses; the large refugee population, both Croatian and Bosnian;\r\n  and the disruption of economic ties to Serbia and the other former\r\n  Yugoslav republics, as well as within its own territory. Western aid\r\n  and investment, especially in the tourist and oil industries, would\r\n  help restore the economy. The government has been successful in some\r\n  reform efforts including stabilization policies and has normalized\r\n  relations with creditors. Yet it still is struggling with\r\n  privatization of large state enterprises and with bank reform.

The government has\r\n  undertaken several reforms in recent years designed to stem excess\r\n  liquidity, raise labor incentives, and increase the availability of\r\n  food, consumer goods, and services from depressed levels. The\r\n  liberalized agricultural markets introduced in October 1994, where\r\n  state and private farms are authorized to sell any above-quota\r\n  production at unrestricted prices, have broadened legal consumption\r\n  alternatives and reduced black market prices. The government's\r\n  efforts to reduce subsidies to loss-making enterprises and shrink\r\n  the money supply caused the black market exchange rate to move from\r\n  a peak of 120 pesos to the dollar in the summer of 1994 to 25-30\r\n  pesos to the dollar at yearend 1995. The number of self-employed\r\n  workers licensed by the government increased more slowly in 1995,\r\n  from 160,000 at yearend 1994 to 190,000 in July 1995 and to about\r\n  210,000 in January 1996. Discussions continue within the leadership\r\n  over the relative affluence of self-employed workers and the growing\r\n  inequality of income in what has historically been a strictly\r\n  egalitarian society. The government released new economic data in\r\n  1995 which showed a 35% decline in GDP during 1989-1993, a drop\r\n  precipitated by the withdrawal of massive Soviet aid and prolonged\r\n  by Cuba's own economic inefficiencies. The decline in GDP apparently\r\n  was halted in 1994, and government officials claim that GDP\r\n  increased by 2.5% in 1995. Export earnings rose by 20% in 1995 to\r\n  $1.6 billion, largely on the strength of higher world prices for key\r\n  commodities and increased production of nickel through joint\r\n  ventures with a Canadian firm. Higher export revenues and new\r\n  credits from European firms and Mexico enabled Havana to increase\r\n  its imports for the first time in six years. Imports rose 21% to\r\n  almost $2.4 billion, or 30% of the 1989 level. Officials have\r\n  sharply criticized provisions of legislation under consideration in\r\n  the US Congress, which aims to curtail third-country investment in\r\n  expropriated US properties in Cuba and deny official assistance to\r\n  Havana.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $14.7 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 2.5% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $1,300 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 7%\r\n  industry: 30%\r\n  services: 63% (1994)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): NA%\r\n\r\nLabor force: 4.71 million economically active population (1989);\r\n  3,527,000 employed in state civilian sector (1989)\r\n  by occupation: services and government 30%, industry 22%,\r\n  agriculture 20%, commerce 11%, construction 10%, transportation and\r\n  communications 7% (June 1990)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $NA\r\n  expenditures: $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n\r\nIndustries: sugar, petroleum, food, tobacco, textiles, chemicals,\r\n  paper and wood products, metals (particularly nickel), cement,\r\n  fertilizers, consumer goods, agricultural machinery\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 6% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 3,990,000 kW\r\n  production: 12 billion kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 1,022 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: sugarcane, tobacco, citrus, coffee, rice, potatoes\r\n  and other tubers, beans;

Industry\r\n  contributes 25% to GDP and employs 26% of the labor force, while the\r\n  service sector contributes 70% to GDP and employs 62% of the labor\r\n  force. After surging 9.7% in 1992, economic growth slowed to 1.6% in\r\n  1993 - its lowest level in two decades - because of the decline in\r\n  tourist arrivals associated with the recession in Western Europe,\r\n  Cyprus' main trading partner, and the loss in export competitiveness\r\n  due to a sharp rise in unit labor costs. However, real GDP picked up\r\n  in 1994 and 1995, as inflation fell from 4.7% to about 3%. Economic\r\n  prospects appear favorable for 1996: real GDP is likely to grow\r\n  between 3% and 4%, and inflation is likely to rise slightly to\r\n  3.5%-4.5%. The Turkish Cypriot economy has less than one-third the\r\n  per capita GDP of the south. Because it is recognized only by\r\n  Turkey, it has had much difficulty arranging foreign financing, and\r\n  foreign firms have hesitated to invest there. The economy remains\r\n  heavily dependent on agriculture and government service, which\r\n  together employ about half of the work force. Moreover, the small,\r\n  vulnerable economy has suffered because the Turkish lira is legal\r\n  tender. Economic growth sharply dropped during 1994 because of the\r\n  severe economic crisis affecting the mainland, and inflation soared\r\n  to 215%. To compensate for the economy's weakness, Turkey provides\r\n  direct and indirect aid to nearly every sector; financial support\r\n  has risen and now equals in value about one-third of Turkish Cypriot\r\n  GDP.\r\n\r\nGDP:\r\n  Greek area: purchasing power parity - $7.8 billion (1995 est.)\r\n  Turkish area: purchasing power parity - $520 million (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate:\r\n  Greek area: 5% (1995 est.)\r\n  Turkish area: 0.5% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita:\r\n  Greek area: $13,000 (1995 est.)\r\n  Turkish area: $3,900 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  Greek area - agriculture: 5.6%\r\n  Greek area - industry: 24.9%\r\n  Greek area - services: 69.5% (1994)\r\n  Turkish area - agriculture: 11.4%\r\n  Turkish area - industry: 22.9%\r\n  Turkish area - services: 65.7% (1994)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  Greek area: 3% (1995 est.)\r\n  Turkish area: 215% (1994)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\n  Greek area: 294,100\r\n  by occupation: services 61.5%, industry 26%, agriculture 12.5% (1994)\r\n  Turkish area: 75,320\r\n  by occupation: services 52.9%, industry 23.6%, agriculture 23.5%\r\n  (1994)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  Greek area: 2.7% (1994)\r\n  Turkish area: 1.6% (1994)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: Greek area - $2.3 billion, Turkish area - $246 million\r\n  expenditures: Greek area - $3.4 billion, including capital\r\n  expenditures of $500 million, Turkish area - $350 million, including\r\n  capital expenditures of $75 million (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: food, beverages, textiles, chemicals, metal products,\r\n  tourism, wood products\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate:\r\n  Greek area: 3.7% (1994)\r\n  Turkish area: 2.6% (1992)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 550,000 kW\r\n  production: 2.3 billion kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 2,903 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: potatoes, vegetables, barley, grapes, olives, citrus,\r\n  vegetables\r\n\r\nIllicit drugs: transit point for heroin via air routes and\r\n  container traffic to Europe, especially from Lebanon and Turkey,\r\n  also some cocaine transits en route to Russia\r\n\r\nExports:\r\n  Greek area: $968 million (f.o.b., 1994)\r\n  commodities: citrus, potatoes, grapes, wine, cement, clothing and\r\n  shoes\r\n  partners: UK 16%, Lebanon 9%, Greece 8%, Russia 12%\r\n  Turkish area: $59 million (f.o.b., 1994)\r\n  commodities: citrus, potatoes, textiles\r\n  partners: UK 48%, Turkey 22%\r\n\r\nImports:\r\n  Greek area: $2.7 billion (f.o.b., 1994)\r\n  commodities: consumer goods, petroleum and lubricants, food and feed\r\n  grains, machinery\r\n  partners: UK 12%, Japan 9%, Italy 10%, Germany 9%, US 8%\r\n  Turkish area: $330 million (f.o.b., 1994)\r\n  commodities: food, minerals, chemicals, machinery\r\n  partners: Turkey 48%, UK 19%\r\n\r\nExternal debt:\r\n  Greek area: $1.4 billion (1994)\r\n\r\nEconomic aid:\r\n  Greek area - recipient: ODA, $NA\r\n  Turkish area: during 1977-93, received substantial grants and loans\r\n  from Turkey\r\n\r\nCurrency: 1 Cypriot pound (LC) = 100 cents;

Inflation in 1994-95 was cut in half;\r\n  unemployment was kept at about 3%; the budget was balanced; and\r\n  exports were reoriented to the EU. Prague's mass privatization\r\n  program, including its innovative distribution of ownership shares\r\n  to Czech citizens via \"coupon vouchers,\" has made the most rapid\r\n  progress in Eastern Europe. About 80% of the economy is wholly or\r\n  partially in private hands. Because of its progress on reform, the\r\n  Czech Republic in 1995 became the first post-Communist member of the\r\n  OECD. Its solid economic performance also led Standard and Poor's to\r\n  upgrade the country's sovereign credit rating to \"A\" and attracted\r\n  nearly $5.3 billion in direct foreign investment to Czech industry\r\n  between 1990 and September 1995. The Czech crown became convertible\r\n  for current account transactions in October 1995. Czech companies\r\n  increasingly are using the international capital market to fund\r\n  capital investment, and foreign currency reserves totaled $13.9\r\n  billion at the end of 1995. Prague's biggest macroeconomic concern\r\n  now is limiting the inflationary effect of these large capital\r\n  inflows. The Czech economy also still faces microeconomic problems.\r\n  Prague has promised to strengthen its bankruptcy law and improve the\r\n  transparency of stock market operations in 1996, but some changes\r\n  probably will not take effect until some time after the\r\n  parliamentary elections of mid-1996 and will depend largely on\r\n  voluntary compliance. Prague forecasts a balanced budget, 5.5% GDP\r\n  growth, 2.8% unemployment, and 8.1% inflation for 1996.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $106.2 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 5% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $10,200 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 5.8%\r\n  industry: 40.7%\r\n  services: 53.5%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 9.1% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 5.389 million\r\n  by occupation: industry 37.9%, agriculture 8.1%, construction 8.8%,\r\n  communications and other 45.2% (1990)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 2.9% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $16.5 billion\r\n  expenditures: $16.2 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: fuels, ferrous metallurgy, machinery and equipment,\r\n  coal, motor vehicles, glass, armaments\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 12.9% (January-November 1995)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 14.470,000 kW\r\n  production: 56.3 billion kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 4,842 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: grains, potatoes, sugar beets, hops, fruit;

Denmark is\r\n  self-sufficient in food production. The new center-left coalition\r\n  government will concentrate on reducing the persistently high\r\n  unemployment rate and the budget deficit as well as following the\r\n  previous government's policies of maintaining low inflation and a\r\n  current account surplus. In the face of recent international market\r\n  pressure on the Danish krone, the coalition has also vowed to\r\n  maintain a stable currency. The coalition hopes to lower marginal\r\n  income taxes while maintaining overall tax revenues; boost\r\n  industrial competitiveness through labor market and tax reforms and\r\n  increased research and development funds; and improve welfare\r\n  services for the neediest while cutting paperwork and delays. Prime\r\n  Minister RASMUSSEN's reforms will focus on adapting Denmark to the\r\n  criteria for European integration by 1999; Copenhagen has won from\r\n  the European Union (EU) the right to opt out of the European\r\n  Monetary Union (EMU) if a national referendum rejects it. Denmark\r\n  is, in fact, one of the few EU countries likely to fit into the EMU\r\n  on time. Denmark is weathering the current worldwide slump better\r\n  than many West European countries. Although unemployment is high, it\r\n  remains stable compared to most European countries.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $112.8 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 3.1% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $21,700 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 3%\r\n  industry: 23.5%\r\n  services: 73.5% (1994)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 2.4% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 2,553,900\r\n  by occupation: private services 37.1%, government services 30.4%,\r\n  manufacturing and mining 20%, construction 6.3%, agriculture,\r\n  forestry, and fishing 5.6%, electricity/gas/water 0.6% (1991)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 9.5% (1995)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $56.5 billion\r\n  expenditures: $64.4 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: food processing, machinery and equipment, textiles and\r\n  clothing, chemical products, electronics, construction, furniture,\r\n  and other wood products, shipbuilding\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: -2.5% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 10,030,000 kW\r\n  production: 32 billion kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 5,835 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: grain, potatoes, rape, sugar beets;

Two-thirds of the inhabitants live\r\n  in the capital city, the remainder being mostly nomadic herders.\r\n  Scanty rainfall limits crop production to fruits and vegetables, and\r\n  most food must be imported. Djibouti provides services as both a\r\n  transit port for the region and an international transshipment and\r\n  refueling center. It has few natural resources and little industry.\r\n  The nation is, therefore, heavily dependent on foreign assistance\r\n  (an important supplement to GDP) to help support its balance of\r\n  payments and to finance development projects. An unemployment rate\r\n  of over 30% continues to be a major problem. Per capita consumption\r\n  dropped an estimated 35% over the last six years because of\r\n  recession, civil war, and a high population growth rate (including\r\n  immigrants and refugees).\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $500 million (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: -3% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $1,200 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 3%\r\n  industry: 21%\r\n  services: 76% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 6% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 282,000\r\n  by occupation: agriculture 75%, industry 11%, services 14% (1991\r\n  est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: over 30% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $164 million\r\n  expenditures: $201 million, including capital expenditures of $16\r\n  million (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: limited to a few small-scale enterprises, such as\r\n  dairy products and mineral-water bottling\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 90,000 kW\r\n  production: 170 million kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 398 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: fruits, vegetables;

Output growth was concentrated\r\n  in the tourism and free trade zone (ftz) sectors while sugar and\r\n  non-ftz manufacturing declined last year. Drought in early 1995 hurt\r\n  agricultural production but favorable world prices for export\r\n  commodities helped mitigate the impact. Sugar refining was\r\n  devastated by a disastrous harvest resulting from the drought and\r\n  ongoing problems at the state-owned sugar company.

Growth has been uneven in recent years because\r\n  of fluctuations in prices for Ecuador's primary exports - oil and\r\n  bananas - as well as because of government policies designed to curb\r\n  inflation. President Sixto DURAN-BALLEN launched a series of\r\n  macroeconomic reforms when he came into office in August 1992, which\r\n  included raising domestic fuel prices and utility rates, eliminating\r\n  most subsidies, and bringing the government budget into balance.\r\n  These measures helped to reduce inflation from 55% in 1992 to 25% in\r\n  1995. DURAN-BALLEN has a much more favorable attitude toward foreign\r\n  investment than his predecessor and has supported several laws\r\n  designed to encourage foreign investment. Ecuador has implemented\r\n  free or complementary trade agreements with Bolivia, Chile,\r\n  Colombia, Peru, and Venezuela, as well as joined the World Trade\r\n  Organization. Growth slowed to 2.3% in 1995 due in part to high\r\n  domestic interest rates and shortages of electric power.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $44.6 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 2.3% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $4,100 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 13%\r\n  industry: 39%\r\n  services: 48% (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 25% (1995)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 2.8 million\r\n  by occupation: agriculture 35%, manufacturing 21%, commerce 16%,\r\n  services and other activities 28% (1982)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 7.1% (1994)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $3.3 billion\r\n  expenditures: $3.3 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: petroleum, food processing, textiles, metal work,\r\n  paper products, wood products, chemicals, plastics, fishing, lumber\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 6.4% (1993)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 2,230,000 kW\r\n  production: 6.9 billion kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 612 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: bananas, coffee, cocoa, rice, potatoes, manioc,\r\n  plantains, sugarcane;

Even so, the economy grew rapidly during the late 1970s\r\n  and early 1980s, but in 1986 the collapse of world oil prices and an\r\n  increasingly heavy burden of debt servicing led Egypt to begin\r\n  negotiations with the IMF for balance-of-payments support. Egypt's\r\n  first IMF standby arrangement, concluded in mid-1987, was suspended\r\n  in early 1988 because of the government's failure to adopt promised\r\n  reforms. Egypt signed a follow-on program with the IMF and also\r\n  negotiated a structural adjustment loan with the World Bank in 1991.\r\n  In 1991-93 the government made solid progress on administrative\r\n  reforms such as liberalizing exchange and interest rates, but\r\n  resisted implementing major structural reforms like streamlining the\r\n  public sector. As a result, the economy has not gained enough\r\n  momentum to tackle the growing problem of unemployment. Egypt made\r\n  uneven progress in implementing the successor programs it signed\r\n  onto in late 1993 with the IMF and World Bank; currently it is\r\n  negotiating another successor program with the IMF. President\r\n  MUBARAK has cited population growth as the main cause of the\r\n  country's economic troubles. The addition of about 1.2 million\r\n  people a year to the already huge population of 63 million exerts\r\n  enormous pressure on the 5% of the land area available for\r\n  agriculture along the Nile.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $171 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 4% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $2,760 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: NA%\r\n  industry: NA%\r\n  services: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 9.4% (yearend 1995)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 16 million (1994 est.)\r\n  by occupation: government, public sector enterprises, and armed\r\n  forces 36%, agriculture 34%, privately owned service and\r\n  manufacturing enterprises 20% (1984)\r\n  note: shortage of skilled labor;

Yet, because the\r\n  1980s were a decade of civil war and stagnation, per capita GDP has\r\n  not regained the level of the late 1970s. The rebound in the 1990s\r\n  stems from the government program, in conjunction with the IMF, of\r\n  privatization, deregulation, and fiscal stabilization. The economy\r\n  now is oriented more toward manufacturing and services compared with\r\n  agriculture. The sizable trade deficits are in the main covered by\r\n  remittances from the large number of Salvadorans abroad.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $11.4 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 6.3% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $1,950 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: NA%\r\n  industry: NA%\r\n  services: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 11.4% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 1.7 million (1982 est.)\r\n  by occupation: agriculture 40%, commerce 16%, manufacturing 15%,\r\n  government 13%, financial services 9%, transportation 6%, other 1%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 6.7% (1993)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $846 million\r\n  expenditures: $890 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: food processing, beverages, petroleum, tobacco,\r\n  chemicals, textiles, furniture\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 7.6% (1993)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 750,000 kW\r\n  production: 2.4 billion kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 408 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: coffee, sugarcane, corn, rice, beans, oilseed;

Subsistence farming\r\n  predominates. Although pre-independence Equatorial Guinea counted on\r\n  cocoa production for hard currency earnings, the deterioration of\r\n  the rural economy under successive brutal regimes has diminished\r\n  potential for agriculture-led growth. A number of aid programs\r\n  sponsored by the World Bank and the IMF have been cut off since 1993\r\n  because of the government's gross corruption and mismanagement.\r\n  Businesses, for the most part, are owned by government officials and\r\n  their family members. Undeveloped natural resources include\r\n  titanium, iron ore, manganese, uranium, and alluvial gold. Oil\r\n  exploration, taking place under concessions offered to US, French,\r\n  and Spanish firms, has been moderately successful.

Domestic output is\r\n  substantially augmented by worker remittances from abroad.\r\n  Government revenues come from custom duties and income and sales\r\n  taxes. Eritrea has inherited the entire coastline of Ethiopia and\r\n  has long-term prospects for revenues from the development of\r\n  offshore oil, offshore fishing, and tourism. For the time being,\r\n  Ethiopia will be largely dependent on Eritrean ports for its foreign\r\n  trade.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $2 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 10% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $570 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: NA%\r\n  industry: NA%\r\n  services: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 10% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: NA\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $NA\r\n  expenditures: $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n\r\nIndustries: food processing, beverages, clothing and textiles\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: NA kW\r\n  production: NA kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: NA kWh\r\n\r\nAgriculture: sorghum, lentils, vegetables, maize, cotton, tobacco,\r\n  coffee, sisal (for making rope);

Bolstered by a\r\n  widespread national desire to reintegrate into Western Europe,\r\n  Estonia has adhered to disciplined fiscal and financial policies and\r\n  has led the FSU countries in pursuing economic reform. Monthly\r\n  inflation has been held to under 5% since the beginning of 1992,\r\n  with monthly inflation in 1995 at 2%. Following four years of\r\n  decline, Estonia's GDP grew 5% in 1994 and 6% in 1995 - among the\r\n  highest rates in Europe, according to estimates of the IMF and\r\n  Estonia's own Economic Ministry. Despite these positive economic\r\n  indicators, unemployment - 8% in 1994 - is on the rise, and wages -\r\n  especially for teachers and law enforcement personnel - have not\r\n  kept pace with inflation. Small- and medium-scale privatization is\r\n  essentially complete, and large-scale privatization is progressing,\r\n  but slowly. Estonia has successfully reoriented it trade toward the\r\n  West, two-thirds of exports now going to Western markets. Estonia's\r\n  free trade policies were the cornerstone of its negotiations with\r\n  the European Union, and led to the signing of an association\r\n  agreement in June 1995. Estonia was the only Baltic state not to\r\n  have a transition period imposed by the EU prior to its\r\n  implementation of a free trade agreement.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $12.3 billion (1995 estimate as\r\n  extrapolated from World Bank estimate for 1994)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 6% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $7,600 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 10%\r\n  industry: 37%\r\n  services: 53% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 29% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 750,000 (1992)\r\n  by occupation: industry and construction 42%, agriculture and\r\n  forestry 20%, other 38% (1990)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 8% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $620 million\r\n  expenditures: $582 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (January-October 1995)\r\n\r\nIndustries: oil shale, shipbuilding, phosphates, electric motors,\r\n  excavators, cement, furniture, clothing, textiles, paper, shoes,\r\n  apparel\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 3,420,000 kW\r\n  production: 11.3 billion kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 6,528 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: potatoes, fruits, vegetables;

Its economy is based on agriculture, which accounts for\r\n  about half of GDP, 90% of exports, and 80% of total employment;\r\n  coffee generates 60% of export earnings. The agricultural sector\r\n  suffers from frequent periods of drought, poor cultivation\r\n  practices, and deterioration of internal security conditions. The\r\n  manufacturing sector is heavily dependent on inputs from the\r\n  agricultural sector. Over 90% of large-scale industry, but less than\r\n  10% of agriculture, is state-run. The government is considering\r\n  selling off a portion of state-owned plants and is implementing\r\n  reform measures that are gradually liberalizing the economy.

Dairy farming supports domestic consumption; crops\r\n  furnish winter fodder. Exports feature shipments of high-grade wool\r\n  to the UK and the sale of postage stamps and coins. Rich stocks of\r\n  fish in the surrounding waters are not presently exploited by the\r\n  islanders. So far, efforts to establish a domestic fishing industry\r\n  have been unsuccessful. The economy has diversified since 1987, when\r\n  the government began selling fishing licenses to foreign trawlers\r\n  operating within the Falklands exclusive fishing zone. These license\r\n  fees total more than $40 million per year and support the island's\r\n  health, education, and welfare system. To encourage tourism, the\r\n  Falkland Islands Development Corporation has built three lodges for\r\n  visitors attracted by the abundant wildlife and trout fishing. The\r\n  islands are now self-financing except for defense. The British\r\n  Geological Survey announced a 200-mile oil exploration zone around\r\n  the islands in 1993, and early seismic surveys suggest substantial\r\n  reserves capable of producing 500,000 barrels per day. An agreement\r\n  between Argentina and the United Kingdom in 1995 seeks to defuse\r\n  licensing and sovereignty conflicts that would dampen foreign\r\n  interest in exploiting potential oil reserves.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $NA\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $NA\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: NA%\r\n  industry: NA%\r\n  services: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): NA%\r\n\r\nLabor force: 1,100 (est.)\r\n  by occupation: agriculture 95% (mostly sheepherding)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%;

Near-term forecasts suggest\r\n  continued economic recovery, and oil finds close to the Faroese area\r\n  may lay the basis for an eventual economic rebound.

Sugar\r\n  exports and tourism are the major sources of foreign exchange.\r\n  Industry contributes 17% to GDP; sugar processing makes up one-third\r\n  of industrial activity. Roughly 250,000 tourists visit each year.\r\n  Political uncertainty and drought, however, contribute to\r\n  substantial fluctuations in earnings from tourism and sugar and to\r\n  the emigration of skilled workers. In 1992, growth was approximately\r\n  3%, based on growth in tourism and a lessening of labor-management\r\n  disputes in the sugar and gold-mining sectors. In 1993, the\r\n  government's budgeted growth rate of 3% was not achieved because of\r\n  a decline in non-sugar agricultural output and damage from Cyclone\r\n  Kina. Growth in 1994 of 5% was largely attributable to increased\r\n  tourism and expansion in the manufacturing sector.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $4.7 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 2.2% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $6,100 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 22%\r\n  industry: 17%\r\n  services: 61% (1994)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 2% (1995)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 235,000\r\n  by occupation: subsistence agriculture 67%, wage earners 18%, salary\r\n  earners 15% (1987)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 5.4% (1992)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $495.6 million\r\n  expenditures: $591.2 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: sugar, tourism, copra, gold, silver, clothing, lumber,\r\n  small cottage industries\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 0% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 200,000 kW\r\n  production: 480 million kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 581 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: sugarcane, coconuts, cassava (tapioca), rice, sweet\r\n  potatoes, bananas;

Its key economic sector is manufacturing -\r\n  principally the wood, metals, and engineering industries. Trade is\r\n  important, with the export of goods representing about 30% of GDP.\r\n  Except for timber and several minerals, Finland depends on imports\r\n  of raw materials, energy, and some components for manufactured\r\n  goods. Because of the climate, agricultural development is limited\r\n  to maintaining self-sufficiency in basic products. Forestry, an\r\n  important export earner, provides a secondary occupation for the\r\n  rural population. The economy, which experienced an average of 4.9%\r\n  annual growth between 1987 and 1989, sank into deep recession in\r\n  1991 as GDP contracted by 6.5%. The recession - which continued in\r\n  1992 with GDP contracting by 4.1% - has been caused by economic\r\n  overheating, depressed foreign markets, and the dismantling of the\r\n  barter system between Finland and the former Soviet Union under\r\n  which Soviet oil and gas had been exchanged for Finnish manufactured\r\n  goods. The Finnish Government has proposed efforts to increase\r\n  industrial competitiveness and efficiency by an increase in exports\r\n  to Western markets, cuts in public expenditures, partial\r\n  privatization of state enterprises, and changes in monetary policy.\r\n  In June 1991 Helsinki had tied the markka to the European Union's\r\n  (EU) European Currency Unit (ECU) to promote stability. Ongoing\r\n  speculation resulting from a lack of confidence in the government's\r\n  policies forced Helsinki to devalue the markka by about 12% in\r\n  November 1991 and to indefinitely break the link in September 1992.\r\n  The devaluations have boosted the competitiveness of Finnish\r\n  exports. The recession bottomed out in 1993, and Finland\r\n  participated in the general European upturn of 1994. Unemployment\r\n  probably will remain a serious problem during the next few years;\r\n  the majority of Finnish firms face a weak domestic market and the\r\n  troubled German and Swedish export markets. The Finns voted in an\r\n  October 1994 referendum to enter the EU, and Finland officially\r\n  joined the Union on 1 January 1995. Increasing integration with\r\n  Western Europe will dominate the economic picture over the next few\r\n  years.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $92.4 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 5% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $18,200 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 4.6%\r\n  industry: 28%\r\n  services: 67.4% (1994)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 2% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 2.533 million\r\n  by occupation: public services 30.4%, industry 20.9%, commerce\r\n  15.0%, finance, insurance, and business services 10.2%, agriculture\r\n  and forestry 8.6%, transport and communications 7.7%, construction\r\n  7.2%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 17% (1995)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $21.7 billion\r\n  expenditures: $31.7 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: metal products, shipbuilding, pulp and paper, copper\r\n  refining, foodstuffs, chemicals, textiles, clothing\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 5% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 13,360,000 kW\r\n  production: 58 billion kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 12,196 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: cereals, sugar beets, potatoes;

In\r\n  running important industrial segments (railways, airlines,\r\n  electricity, telecommunications), administrating an exceptionally\r\n  generous social welfare system, and staffing an enormous\r\n  bureaucracy, the state spends about 55% of GDP. France has\r\n  substantial agricultural resources and a diversified modern\r\n  industrial sector. Large tracts of fertile land, the application of\r\n  modern technology, and subsidies have combined to make it the\r\n  leading agricultural producer in Western Europe. Largely\r\n  self-sufficient in agricultural products, France is a major exporter\r\n  of wheat and dairy products. The industrial sector generates about\r\n  one-quarter of GDP, and the growing services sector has become\r\n  crucial to the economy. Following stagnation and recession in\r\n  1991-93, French GDP expanded 2.4% in 1994 and in 1995. Persistently\r\n  high unemployment still poses a major problem for the government, as\r\n  will the need to cut back on welfare benefits and bureaucratic\r\n  budgets. Paris remains committed to maintaining the franc-deutsche\r\n  mark parity, which has kept French interest rates high at the\r\n  expense of jobs. Although the pace of economic and financial\r\n  integration within the European Union has slowed down, integration\r\n  will remain a major force in France, shaping the fortunes of the\r\n  various economic sectors over the next few years.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $1.173 trillion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 2.4% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $20,200 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 2.4%\r\n  industry: 26.5%\r\n  services: 71.1% (1994)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 1.7% (1995)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 24.17 million\r\n  by occupation: services 61.5%, industry 31.3%, agriculture 7.2%\r\n  (1987)\r\n  note: includes Corsica\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 11.7% (yearend 1995)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $220.5 billion\r\n  expenditures: $249.1 billion, including capital expenditures of $47\r\n  billion (1993 budget)\r\n\r\nIndustries: steel, machinery, chemicals, automobiles, metallurgy,\r\n  aircraft, electronics, mining, textiles, food processing, tourism\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 2.6% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 105,250,000 kW\r\n  production: 447 billion kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 6,149 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: wheat, cereals, sugar beets, potatoes, wine grapes;\r\n  beef, dairy products;

Besides the French space center at\r\n  Kourou, fishing and forestry are the most important economic\r\n  activities, with exports of fish and fish products (mostly shrimp)\r\n  accounting for more than 60% of total revenue in 1992. The large\r\n  reserves of tropical hardwoods, not fully exploited, support an\r\n  expanding sawmill industry that provides sawn logs for export.\r\n  Cultivation of crops is limited to the coastal area, where the\r\n  population is largely concentrated. French Guiana is heavily\r\n  dependent on imports of food and energy. Unemployment is a serious\r\n  problem, particularly among younger workers.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $800 million (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $6,000 (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: NA%\r\n  industry: NA%\r\n  services: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 2.5% (1992)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 36,597 (1993)\r\n  by occupation: services, government, and commerce 60.6%, industry\r\n  21.2%, agriculture 18.2% (1980)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 24.1% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $133 million\r\n  expenditures: $284 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: construction, shrimp processing, forestry products,\r\n  rum, gold mining\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 180,000 kW\r\n  production: 450 million kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 3,149 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: rice, corn, manioc, cocoa, vegetables, bananas,\r\n  sugar;

Gabon depended on timber\r\n  and manganese until oil was discovered offshore in the early 1970s.\r\n  The oil sector now accounts for 50% of GDP. Real GDP growth has been\r\n  feeble since 1992 and Gabon continues to face the problem of\r\n  fluctuating prices for its oil, timber, manganese, and uranium\r\n  exports. Despite an abundance of natural wealth, and a manageable\r\n  rate of population growth, the economy is hobbled by poor fiscal\r\n  management. In 1992, the fiscal deficit widened to 2.4% of GDP, and\r\n  Gabon failed to settle arrears on its bilateral debt, leading to a\r\n  cancellation of rescheduling agreements with official and private\r\n  creditors. Devaluation of its Francophone currency by 50% on 12\r\n  January 1994 sparked a one-time inflationary surge, to 35%; the rate\r\n  dropped to 15% in 1995. Nevertheless, the government must continue\r\n  to keep a tight rein on spending and wage increases. The IMF and\r\n  France are considering offering financial assistance in 1996 if\r\n  Gabon shows progress in privatization and fiscal discipline.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $6 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 2% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $5,200 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 8.2%\r\n  industry: 44.7%\r\n  services: 47.1% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 15% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 120,000 salaried\r\n  by occupation: agriculture 65.0%, industry and commerce 30.0%,\r\n  services 2.5%, government 2.5%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 10%-14% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $1.3 billion\r\n  expenditures: $1.6 billion, including capital expenditures of $311\r\n  million (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: food and beverage; textile; lumbering and plywood;\r\n  cement; petroleum extraction and refining; manganese, uranium, and\r\n  gold mining; chemicals; ship repair\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: -3% (1991)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 315,000 kW\r\n  production: 910 million kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 757 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: cocoa, coffee, sugar, palm oil; rubber; okoume (a\r\n  tropical softwood); cattle; small fishing operations (provide a\r\n  catch of about 20,000 metric tons)\r\n\r\nExports: $2.1 billion (f.o.b., 1994 est.)\r\n  commodities: crude oil 80%, timber 14%, manganese 6%, uranium\r\n  partners: US 50%, France 16%, Japan 8%, Spain 6%, Germany NA (1994\r\n  est.)\r\n\r\nImports: $800 million (f.o.b., 1994 est.)\r\n  commodities: foodstuffs, chemical products, petroleum products,\r\n  construction materials, manufactures, machinery\r\n  partners: France 35%, African countries, US, Japan, Netherlands\r\n  (1994)\r\n\r\nExternal debt: $3.8 billion (1993 )\r\n\r\nEconomic aid:\r\n  recipient: ODA, $75 million (1993)\r\n\r\nCurrency: 1 Communaute Financiere Africaine franc (CFAF) = 100\r\n  centimes\r\n\r\nExchange rates: CFA francs (CFAF) per US$1 - 500.56 (January\r\n  1996), 499.15 (1995), 555.20 (1994), 283.16 (1993), 264.69 (1992),\r\n  282.11 (1991)\r\n  note: beginning 12 January 1994, the CFA franc was devalued to CFAF\r\n  100 per French franc from CFAF 50 at which it had been fixed since\r\n  1948\r\n\r\nFiscal year: calendar year\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTransportation\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n\r\nRailways:\r\n  total: 649 km Gabon State Railways (OCTRA)\r\n  standard gauge: 649 km 1.435-m gauge; single track (1994)\r\n\r\nHighways:\r\n  total: 7,456 km\r\n  paved: 560 km\r\n  unpaved: 6,896 km (1988 est.)\r\n\r\nWaterways: 1,600 km perennially navigable\r\n\r\nPipelines: crude oil 270 km; petroleum products 14 km\r\n\r\nPorts: Cape Lopez, Kango, Lambarene, Libreville, Mayumba, Owendo,\r\n  Port-Gentil\r\n\r\nMerchant marine:\r\n  total: 3 bulk (1,000 GRT or over) totaling 36,976 GRT/60,319 DWT\r\n  (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nAirports:\r\n  total: 54\r\n  with paved runways over 3 047 m: 1\r\n  with paved runways 2 438 to 3 047 m: 1\r\n  with paved runways 1 524 to 2 437 m: 7\r\n  with paved runways 914 to 1 523 m: 1\r\n  with paved runways under 914 m: 21\r\n  with unpaved runways 1 524 to 2 437 m: 8\r\n  with unpaved runways 914 to 1 523 m: 15 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommunications\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n\r\nTelephones: 22,000 (1991 est.)\r\n\r\nTelephone system:\r\n  domestic: adequate system of cable, microwave radio relay,\r\n  tropospheric scatter, radiotelephone communication stations, and a\r\n  domestic satellite system with 12 earth stations\r\n  international: satellite earth stations - 3 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean)\r\n\r\nRadio broadcast stations: AM 6, FM 6, shortwave 0\r\n\r\nRadios: 250,000 (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nTelevision broadcast stations: 3 (repeaters 5)\r\n\r\nTelevisions: 40,000 (1993 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDefense\r\n-------\r\n\r\n\r\nBranches: Army, Navy, Air Force, Presidential Guard, National\r\n  Gendarmerie, National Police\r\n\r\nManpower availability:\r\n  males age 15-49: 273,662\r\n  males fit for military service: 139,439\r\n  males reach military age (20) annually: 10,966 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nDefense expenditures: exchange rate conversion - $154 million,\r\n  2.4% of GDP (1993)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n======================================================================\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n@Gaza Strip\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThe Israel-PLO Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government\r\nArrangements (\"the DOP\"), signed in Washington on 13 September 1993,\r\nprovides for a transitional period not exceeding five years of\r\nPalestinian interim self-government in the Gaza Strip and the West\r\nBank.

Gaza has depended upon Israel for nearly 90% of its\r\n  external trade. Aggravating the impact of Israeli military\r\n  administration, unrest in the territory from 1988 to 1993\r\n  (intifadah) raised unemployment and lowered the standard of living\r\n  of Gazans. The Persian Gulf crisis and its aftershocks also dealt\r\n  blows to Gaza since August 1990.

Separatist conflicts in Abkhazia and\r\nSouth Ossetia have been dormant for more than two years, although\r\npolitical settlements remain elusive. Russian peacekeepers are\r\ndeployed in both regions and a UN Observer Mission is operating in\r\nAbkhazia. As a result of these conflicts, Georgia still has about\r\n250,000 internally displaced people. In November 1995, Georgia held\r\npeaceful, generally free and fair nationwide presidential and\r\nparliamentary elections. Although the country continues to suffer\r\nfrom a crippling economic crisis, aggravated by a severe energy\r\nshortage, some progress has been made and the Georgian Government\r\nremains committed to economic reform in cooperation with the IMF and\r\nthe World Bank. Violence and organized crime were sharply curtailed\r\nin 1995.\r\n\r\nMap\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation: 42 00 N, 43 30 E -- Southwestern Asia, bordering the\r\n  Black Sea, between Turkey and Russia\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFlag\r\n----\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription: maroon field with small rectangle in upper hoist side\r\n  corner;

Its only sizable internal energy resource is\r\n  hydropower. Since 1991 the economy has sustained severe damage from\r\n  civil strife. Georgia has been suffering from acute energy\r\n  shortages, as it is having problems paying for even minimal imports.\r\n  Georgia is pinning its hopes for long-term recovery largely on\r\n  reestablishing trade ties with Russia and on developing\r\n  international transportation through the key Black Sea ports of\r\n  P'ot'i and Bat'umi. Statistical estimates on Georgia are subject to\r\n  a particularly wide margin of error, even compared with other FSU\r\n  countries. The GDP estimate below probably does not reflect much of\r\n  its grass roots economic activity. GDP is supplemented by\r\n  considerable EU and US humanitarian aid.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $6.2 billion (1995 estimate as\r\n  extrapolated from World Bank estimate for 1994)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: -11% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $1,080 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 70.4%\r\n  industry: 10.2%\r\n  services: 19.4% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 2.2% monthly average (first half\r\n  1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 2.763 million\r\n  by occupation: industry and construction 31%, agriculture and\r\n  forestry 25%, other 44% (1990)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: officially less than 5% but real unemployment\r\n  may be more than 20%, with even larger numbers of underemployed\r\n  workers\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $NA\r\n  expenditures: $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n\r\nIndustries: steel, aircraft, machine tools, foundry equipment,\r\n  electric locomotives, tower cranes, electric welding equipment,\r\n  machinery for food preparation and meat packing, electric motors,\r\n  process control equipment, trucks, tractors, textiles, shoes,\r\n  chemicals, wood products, wine\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: -10% (1995)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 4,410,000 kW\r\n  production: 9.1 billion kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 1,526 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: citrus, grapes, tea, vegetables, potatoes;

Despite substantial\r\n  progress toward economic integration, the eastern states will\r\n  continue to rely on subsidies from the federal government into the\r\n  next century. Assistance to the east of about $100 billion annually\r\n  has helped the region average nearly 8% annual economic growth since\r\n  1991, even though the overall German economy has averaged less than\r\n  2% growth. The economic recovery in the east has been led by the\r\n  construction industries, with growth increasingly supported by the\r\n  service sectors and light manufacturing industries. Western Germany,\r\n  which accounts for 90% of overall German GDP and has three times the\r\n  per capita income of eastern Germany, is perennially the first- or\r\n  second-largest exporter, after the US, in the world. Nonetheless,\r\n  business and political leaders have in recent years become\r\n  increasingly concerned about Germany's apparent decline in\r\n  attractiveness as a business location. They cite the increasing\r\n  preference of German companies to locate manufacturing facilities -\r\n  long the strength of the postwar economy - to foreign countries,\r\n  including the US, rather than in Germany, so they can be closer to\r\n  their markets and avoid Germany's high production costs. The\r\n  conditions under which European economic integration - especially\r\n  movement toward a single European currency - will proceed will be\r\n  another key issue facing Germany in the next few years.\r\n\r\nGDP:\r\n  Germany: purchasing power parity - $1.4522 trillion (1995 est.)\r\n  western: purchasing power parity - $1.3318 trillion (1995 est.)\r\n  eastern: purchasing power parity - $120.4 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate:\r\n  Germany: 1.8% (1995 est.)\r\n  western: 1.5% (1995 est.)\r\n  eastern: 6.3% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita:\r\n  Germany: $17,900 (1995 est.)\r\n  western: $21,100 (1995 est.)\r\n  eastern: $6,600 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 1%\r\n  industry: 34.2%\r\n  services: 64.8% (1994)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\r\n  western: 2% (1995 est.)\r\n  eastern: 2% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 36.75 million\r\n  by occupation: industry 41%, agriculture 6%, other 53% (1987)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate:\r\n  western: 8.7% (December 1995)\r\n  eastern: 14.9% (December 1995)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $690 billion\r\n  expenditures: $780 billion, including capital expenditures of $96.5\r\n  billion (1994)\r\n\r\nIndustries:\r\n  western: among world's largest and technologically advanced\r\n  producers of iron, steel, coal, cement, chemicals, machinery,\r\n  vehicles, machine tools, electronics, food and beverages\r\n  eastern: metal fabrication, chemicals, brown coal, shipbuilding,\r\n  machine building, food and beverages, textiles, petroleum refining\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate:\r\n  western: 2.8% (1994)\r\n  eastern: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 115,430,000 kW\r\n  production: 493 billion kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 5,683 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture:\r\n  western: potatoes, wheat, barley, sugar beets, fruit, cabbage;\r\n  cattle, pigs, poultry\r\n  eastern: wheat, rye, barley, potatoes, sugar beets, fruit;

Overall growth\r\n  continued at a rate of approximately 5% in 1995, due largely to\r\n  increased gold, timber, and cocoa production - major sources of\r\n  foreign exchange. The economy, however, continues to revolve around\r\n  subsistence agriculture, which accounts for almost half of GDP and\r\n  employs 55% of the work force, mainly small landholders. Public\r\n  sector wage increases, regional peacekeeping commitments, and the\r\n  containment of internal unrest in the underdeveloped north have\r\n  placed substantial demands on the government's budget and have led\r\n  to inflationary deficit financing, depreciation of the cedi, and\r\n  rising public discontent with Ghana's austerity program.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $25.1 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 5% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $1,400 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 47%\r\n  industry: 16%\r\n  services: 37% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 69% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 3.7 million\r\n  by occupation: agriculture and fishing 54.7%, industry 18.7%, sales\r\n  and clerical 15.2%, professional 3.7%, services, transportation, and\r\n  communications 7.7%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 10% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $1.05 billion\r\n  expenditures: $1.2 billion, including capital expenditures of $178\r\n  million (1993)\r\n\r\nIndustries: mining, lumbering, light manufacturing, aluminum, food\r\n  processing\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 2.8% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 1,180,000 kW\r\n  production: 6.1 billion kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 323 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: cocoa, rice, coffee, cassava (tapioca), peanuts,\r\n  corn, shea nuts, bananas;

Unemployment is increasing, and prospects for economic\r\n  growth in the immediate future are dim. Following the closing of the\r\n  Black Angel lead and zinc mine in 1989, Greenland became almost\r\n  completely dependent on fishing and fish processing, the sector\r\n  accounting for 95% of exports. Prospects for fisheries are not\r\n  bright, as the important shrimp catches will at best stabilize and\r\n  cod catches have dropped. Resumption of mining and hydrocarbon\r\n  activities is not around the corner, thus leaving only tourism with\r\n  some potential for the near future. The public sector, i.e., the\r\n  central government and its commercial entities and the\r\n  municipalities, plays a dominant role in Greenland, accounting for\r\n  about two-thirds of total employment. About half the government's\r\n  revenues come from grants from the Danish Government, an important\r\n  supplement of GDP.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $892 million (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $15,500 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: NA%\r\n  industry: NA%\r\n  services: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 1.3% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 22,800\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 6.6% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $667 million\r\n  expenditures: $635 million, including capital expenditures of $103.8\r\n  million (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: fish processing (mainly shrimp), lead, zinc,\r\n  handicrafts, small shipyards\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 84,000 kW\r\n  production: 210 million kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 3,361 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: forage crops, small garden vegetables;

The economy achieved an\r\n  impressive average annual growth rate of 5.5% in 1986-91 but has\r\n  slowed since 1992.

It is also dependent upon France for\r\n  large subsidies and imports. Tourism is a key industry, with most\r\n  tourists from the US. In addition, an increasingly large number of\r\n  cruise ships visit the islands. The traditionally important\r\n  sugarcane crop is slowly being replaced by other crops, such as\r\n  bananas (which now supply about 50% of export earnings), eggplant,\r\n  and flowers. Other vegetables and root crops are cultivated for\r\n  local consumption, although Guadeloupe is still dependent on\r\n  imported food, which comes mainly from France.

Over the past 20 years, the\r\n  tourist industry has grown rapidly, creating a construction boom for\r\n  new hotels and the expansion of older ones. Visitors numbered about\r\n  900,000 in 1992. The slowdown in Japanese economic growth has been\r\n  reflected in less vigorous growth in the tourism sector. About 60%\r\n  of the labor force works for the private sector and the rest for\r\n  government. Most food and industrial goods are imported, with about\r\n  75% from the US. Guam faces the problem of building up the civilian\r\n  economic sector to offset the impact of military downsizing.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $2 billion (1991 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $14,000 (1991 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: NA%\r\n  industry: NA%\r\n  services: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 4% (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 46,930 (1990)\r\n  by occupation: federal and territorial government 40%, private 60%\r\n  (trade 18%, services 15.6%, construction 13.8%, other 12.6%) (1990)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 2% (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $525 million\r\n  expenditures: $395 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1991)\r\n\r\nIndustries: US military, tourism, construction, transshipment\r\n  services, concrete products, printing and publishing, food\r\n  processing, textiles\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 300,000 kW\r\n  production: 750 million kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 4,797 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: fruits, copra, vegetables;

Manufacturing,\r\n  predominantly in private hands, accounts for about 20% of GDP and\r\n  12% of the labor force. In both 1990 and 1991, the economy grew by\r\n  3%, the fourth and fifth consecutive years of mild growth. In 1992\r\n  growth picked up to almost 5% as government policies favoring\r\n  competition and foreign trade and investment took stronger hold. In\r\n  1993-94, despite political unrest, this momentum continued, foreign\r\n  investment held up, and annual growth averaged 4%. Strong\r\n  international prices for Guatemala's traditional commodity exports\r\n  featured 4.9% growth in 1995. Given the markedly uneven distribution\r\n  of land and income, the government faces major obstacles in its\r\n  program of economic modernization and the reduction of poverty.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $36.7 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 4.9% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $3,300 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 25%\r\n  industry: 20%\r\n  services: 55%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 9% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 3.2 million (1994 est.)\r\n  by occupation: agriculture 60%, services 13%, manufacturing 12%,\r\n  commerce 7%, construction 4%, transport 3%, utilities 0.7%, mining\r\n  0.3% (1985)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 4.9%;

Serious\r\n  underlying economic problems will continue. Electric power has been\r\n  in short supply and constitutes a major barrier to future gains in\r\n  national output.

Nearly 70% of all Haitians depend on the agriculture\r\n  sector, which consists mainly of small-scale subsistence farming and\r\n  employs about two-thirds of the economically active work force. The\r\n  country has experienced only moderate job creation since President\r\n  ARISTIDE was returned to power in October 1994. Failure to reach\r\n  agreement with multilateral lenders in late 1995 led to rising\r\n  deficit spending and subsequently increasing inflation and a drop in\r\n  the value of the Haitian currency in the final months of 1995.\r\n  Potential investors, both foreign and domestic, have been reluctant\r\n  to risk their capital, planning to \"wait and see\" what happens in\r\n  the months following the inauguration of newly elected President\r\n  Rene PREVAL and the drawdown of UN peacekeeping forces. The PREVAL\r\n  government will have to grapple with implementing necessary,\r\n  although unpopular, economic reforms in order to obtain badly needed\r\n  foreign aid and improve Haiti's ability to attract foreign capital\r\n  if the Haitian economy is to gain momentum.

Agriculture, the most important sector of the\r\n  economy, employs nearly two-thirds of the labor force and produces\r\n  two-thirds of exports. Productivity remains low. Manufacturing,\r\n  still in its early stages, employs about 9% of the labor force, and\r\n  generates 20% of exports. Many basic problems face the economy,\r\n  including rapid population growth, high unemployment, inflation, a\r\n  lack of basic services, a large and inefficient public sector, and\r\n  the dependence of the export sector mostly on coffee and bananas,\r\n  which are subject to sharp price fluctuations.

Natural resources are\r\n  limited, and food and raw materials must be imported. Manufacturing\r\n  and construction account for about 18% of GDP. Goods and services\r\n  exports account for about 50% of GDP. Real GDP growth averaged a\r\n  remarkable 8% in 1987-88, slowed to 3.0% in 1989-90, and picked up\r\n  to 4.2% in 1991, 5.0% in 1992, 5.2% in 1993, 5.5% in 1994, and 5.0%\r\n  in 1995. Unemployment, which has been declining since the mid-1980s,\r\n  edged up from 2% to 3.5% in 1995. Notwithstanding, a shortage of\r\n  labor continues to put upward pressure on prices and the cost of\r\n  living. Prospects for 1996 remain bright so long as major trading\r\n  partners continue to be reasonably prosperous and so long as\r\n  investors feel China will support free market practices after the\r\n  takeover in 1997.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $152.4 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 5% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $27,500 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 0.2%\r\n  industry: 18.4%\r\n  services: 81.4% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 8.4% (1995)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 2,915,400 (1994)\r\n  by occupation: manufacturing 28.5%, wholesale and retail trade,\r\n  restaurants, and hotels 27.9%, services 17.7%, financing, insurance,\r\n  and real estate 9.2%, transport and communications 4.5%,\r\n  construction 2.5%, other 9.7% (1989)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 3.5% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $19 billion\r\n  expenditures: $14.1 billion, including capital expenditures of $289\r\n  million (FY94/95)\r\n\r\nIndustries: textiles, clothing, tourism, electronics, plastics,\r\n  toys, watches, clocks\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 2% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 8,930,000 kW\r\n  production: 33 billion kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 4,628 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: fresh vegetables;

The reform process slowed in 1993-94, however, in part\r\n  because of the May 1994 elections and the resulting change in\r\n  government. By 1994 the privatization of state firms had ground to a\r\n  halt, while both the budget and current account deficits soared to\r\n  unsustainable levels - about 8% and 10% of GDP, respectively. The\r\n  situation improved sharply in 1995; an austerity program introduced\r\n  in March reduced both deficits, and a renewed privatization effort\r\n  later in 1995 resulted in more than $3 billion worth of sales of\r\n  state firms to foreign investors - money that will be used to reduce\r\n  Hungary's large foreign debt. As for other macroeconomic\r\n  developments, real GDP increased 2.9% in 1994 - following several\r\n  years of steep decline - and about 1.5% in 1995. Unemployment\r\n  reached 14% in early 1993 before gradually falling back to 10% in\r\n  1995. Inflation has oscillated; it reached 40% in mid-1991, dropped\r\n  to 17% in early 1994, and then jumped back to 31% by mid-1995.\r\n  Prospects for 1996 are good. With the government still committed to\r\n  austerity, both the budget and current account deficits should fall\r\n  to about 4% of GDP. Economic growth is expected to be about 2% and\r\n  unemployment at about 10%, with inflation falling to 20% by yearend.\r\n  In March 1996 the IMF signed a new standby loan agreement with\r\n  Budapest, and the OECD approved Hungary's application for admission.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $72.5 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 1.5% (1995)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $7,000 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 7.3%\r\n  industry: 37.5%\r\n  services: 55.2%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 28.3% (1995)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 4.8 million (1995)\r\n  by occupation: services, trade, government, and other 47.2%,\r\n  industry 29.7%, agriculture 16.1%, construction 7.0% (1991)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 10.4% (yearend 1995)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $12.6 billion\r\n  expenditures: $13.8 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1995)\r\n\r\nIndustries: mining, metallurgy, construction materials, processed\r\n  foods, textiles, chemicals (especially pharmaceuticals), motor\r\n  vehicles\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 6% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 6,740,000 kW\r\n  production: 31 billion kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 3,012 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: wheat, corn, sunflower seed, potatoes, sugar beets;\r\n  pigs, cattle, poultry, dairy products\r\n\r\nIllicit drugs: major transshipment point for Southwest Asian\r\n  heroin and transit point for South American cocaine destined for\r\n  Western Europe;

The\r\n  economy is heavily dependent on the fishing industry, which provides\r\n  nearly 75% of export earnings and employs 12% of the work force. In\r\n  the absence of other natural resources - except energy - Iceland's\r\n  economy is vulnerable to changing world fish prices. The economy, in\r\n  recession since 1988, began to recover in 1993, posting 0.4% growth,\r\n  but was still hampered by cutbacks in fish quotas as well as falling\r\n  world prices for its main exports: fish and fish products, aluminum,\r\n  and ferrosilicon. The center-right government plans to continue its\r\n  policies of reducing the budget and current account deficits,\r\n  limiting foreign borrowing, containing inflation, revising\r\n  agricultural and fishing policies, diversifying the economy, and\r\n  privatizing state-owned industries. The government, however, remains\r\n  divided on the issue of EU membership, primarily because of\r\n  Icelanders' concern about losing control over their fishing\r\n  resources.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $5 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 3.2% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $18,800 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 9.6%\r\n  industry: 22.1%\r\n  services: 68.3% (1994)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 2.5% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 127,900\r\n  by occupation: commerce, transportation, and services 60.0%,\r\n  manufacturing 12.5%, fishing and fish processing 11.8%, construction\r\n  10.8%, agriculture 4.0%, other 0.9% (1990)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 3.9% (December 1995)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $1.9 billion\r\n  expenditures: $2.1 billion, including capital expenditures of $297\r\n  million (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: fish processing, aluminum smelting, ferrosilicon\r\n  production, geothermal power\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 1.75% (1991 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 1,070,000 kW\r\n  production: 4.7 billion kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 16,458 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: potatoes, turnips;

Faster\r\n  economic growth in the 1980s permitted a significant increase in\r\n  real per capita private consumption. A large share of the\r\n  population, perhaps as much as 40%, remains too poor to afford an\r\n  adequate diet. Financial strains in 1990 and 1991 prompted\r\n  government austerity measures that slowed industrial growth but\r\n  permitted India to meet its international payment obligations\r\n  without rescheduling its debt. Production, trade, and investment\r\n  reforms since 1991 have provided new opportunities for Indian\r\n  businessmen and an estimated 200 million plus middle class\r\n  consumers. New Delhi has always paid its foreign debts on schedule\r\n  and has stimulated exports, attracted foreign investment, and\r\n  revived confidence in India's economic prospects. GDP growth in\r\n  1992-95 has averaged nearly 5%. Most of the country's external\r\n  fundamentals - including the current account balance and reserves\r\n  (now nearly $17 billion) are healthy. Party politics is increasingly\r\n  shaping the debate over economic reforms. In addition, the 25 Indian\r\n  states and several union territories, which are playing a more\r\n  active role in determining economic policy, are further complicating\r\n  the economic climate. The Indian Government will also have to watch\r\n  closely rising government expenditures and higher debt servicing\r\n  which could create a debt trap by the turn of the century.\r\n  Nevertheless, India should achieve economic growth of 5.5%-6.5%\r\n  annually through the next several years. Even if a weak coalition\r\n  government comes to power in 1996 and is unable to push reforms\r\n  aggressively, parts of the economy that have already benefited from\r\n  deregulation will continue to grow. Moreover, the country can build\r\n  on other strengths, including its diverse industrial base, large\r\n  scientific and technical pool, well-developed legal system, and its\r\n  large middle class to achieve higher growth.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $1.4087 trillion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 5.5% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $1,500 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: NA%\r\n  industry: NA%\r\n  services: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 9% (1995)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 314.751 million (1990)\r\n  by occupation: agriculture 65% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $36.5 billion\r\n  expenditures: $54.9 billion, including capital expenditures of $11.4\r\n  billion (FY94/95)\r\n\r\nIndustries: textiles, chemicals, food processing, steel,\r\n  transportation equipment, cement, mining, petroleum, machinery\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 10% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 81,200,000 kW (March 1995)\r\n  production: 314 billion kWh (1993)\r\n  consumption per capita: 324 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: rice, wheat, oilseed, cotton, jute, tea, sugarcane,\r\n  potatoes;

It carries a particularly heavy traffic of petroleum\r\n  and petroleum products from the oilfields of the Persian Gulf and\r\n  Indonesia. Its fish are of great and growing importance to the\r\n  bordering countries for domestic consumption and export. Fishing\r\n  fleets from Russia, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan also exploit the Indian\r\n  Ocean, mainly for shrimp and tuna. Large reserves of hydrocarbons\r\n  are being tapped in the offshore areas of Saudi Arabia, Iran, India,\r\n  and western Australia. An estimated 40% of the world's offshore oil\r\n  production comes from the Indian Ocean.

Real GDP growth in 1985-95 averaged about 7%, quite\r\n  impressive, but not sufficient to both slash underemployment and\r\n  absorb the 2.3 million workers annually entering the labor force.\r\n  Plantation crops - rubber and palm oil - and textiles and plywood\r\n  are being encouraged for both export and job generation. Industrial\r\n  output is based on a supply of diverse natural resources, including\r\n  crude oil, natural gas, timber, metals, and coal. Foreign investment\r\n  has also boosted manufacturing output and exports in recent years.\r\n  Indeed, the economy's growth is highly dependent on the continuing\r\n  expansion of nonoil exports. Japan remains Indonesia's most\r\n  important customer and supplier of aid. Like some other rapidly\r\n  developing countries in Southeast Asia, Indonesia is struggling to\r\n  keep the economy from overheating.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $710.9 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 7.5% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $3,500 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 17%\r\n  industry: 32.6%\r\n  services: 50.4%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 8.6% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 67 million\r\n  by occupation: agriculture 55%, manufacturing 10%, construction 4%,\r\n  transport and communications 3% (1985 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 3% official rate;

Over the past several years, the government has introduced\r\n  several measures to liberalize the economy and reduce government\r\n  intervention, but most of these changes have moved slowly or have\r\n  been reversed because of political opposition. Iran has faced\r\n  increasingly severe financial difficulties since mid-1992 due to an\r\n  import surge that began in 1989 and general financial mismanagement.\r\n  At yearend 1993 the Iranian Government estimated that it owed\r\n  foreign creditors about $30 billion; an estimated $8 billion of this\r\n  debt was in arrears. At yearend 1994, Iran rescheduled $12 billion\r\n  in debt. Earnings from oil exports - which provide 85% of Iran's\r\n  export revenues - are providing less relief to Iran than usual\r\n  because of reduced oil prices. Iran's financial situation will\r\n  remain tight in 1996 because the bulk of payments due under its\r\n  rescheduling agreements in 1993-94 will be coming due.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $323.5 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: -2% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $4,700 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 21%\r\n  industry: 37%\r\n  services: 42% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 60% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 15.4 million\r\n  by occupation: agriculture 33%, manufacturing 21%\r\n  note: shortage of skilled labor (1988 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: over 30% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $NA\r\n  expenditures: $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n\r\nIndustries: petroleum, petrochemicals, textiles, cement and other\r\n  construction materials, food processing (particularly sugar refining\r\n  and vegetable oil production), metal fabricating, armaments\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 4.3% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 19,080,000 kW\r\n  production: 50.8 billion kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 745 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: wheat, rice, other grains, sugar beets, fruits, nuts,\r\n  cotton;

The economy has been dominated by\r\n  the oil sector, which has traditionally provided about 95% of\r\n  foreign exchange earnings. In the 1980s, financial problems caused\r\n  by massive expenditures in the eight-year war with Iran and damage\r\n  to oil export facilities by Iran, led the government to implement\r\n  austerity measures and to borrow heavily and later reschedule\r\n  foreign debt payments; Iraq suffered economic losses of at least\r\n  $100 billion from the war. After the end of hostilities in 1988, oil\r\n  exports gradually increased with the construction of new pipelines\r\n  and restoration of damaged facilities. Agricultural development\r\n  remained hampered by labor shortages, salinization, and dislocations\r\n  caused by previous land reform and collectivization programs. The\r\n  industrial sector, although accorded high priority by the\r\n  government, also was under financial constraints. Iraq's seizure of\r\n  Kuwait in August 1990, subsequent international economic embargoes,\r\n  and military action by an international coalition beginning in\r\n  January 1991 drastically changed the economic picture. Industrial\r\n  and transportation facilities, which suffered severe damage, have\r\n  been partially restored. Oil exports remain at less than 5% of the\r\n  previous level. Shortages of spare parts continue. Living standards\r\n  deteriorated even further in 1994 and 1995; consumer prices have\r\n  more than doubled in both 1994 and 1995. The UN-sponsored economic\r\n  embargo has reduced exports and imports and has contributed to the\r\n  sharp rise in prices. The Iraqi Government has been unwilling to\r\n  abide by UN resolutions so that the economic embargo can be removed.\r\n  The government's policies of supporting large military and internal\r\n  security forces and of allocating resources to key supporters of the\r\n  regime have exacerbated shortages. In brief, per capita output for\r\n  1994-95 is well below the 1989-90 level, but any estimate has a wide\r\n  range of error.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $41.1 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $2,000 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: NA%\r\n  industry: NA%\r\n  services: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): NA%\r\n\r\nLabor force: 4.4 million (1989)\r\n  by occupation: services 48%, agriculture 30%, industry 22%\r\n  note: severe labor shortage;

Although exports remain the primary\r\n  engine for Ireland's robust growth, the economy is also benefiting\r\n  from a rise in consumer spending and recovery in both construction\r\n  and business investment. Ireland has substantially reduced its\r\n  external debt since 1987, to 40% of GDP in 1994. Over the same\r\n  period, inflation has fallen sharply and chronic trade deficits have\r\n  been transformed into annual surpluses.

It depends on imports of crude oil,\r\n  grains, raw materials, and military equipment. Despite limited\r\n  natural resources, Israel has intensively developed its agricultural\r\n  and industrial sectors over the past 20 years. Industry employs\r\n  about 22% of Israeli workers, agriculture, forestry, and fishing\r\n  3.5%, and services the rest. Israel is largely self-sufficient in\r\n  food production except for grains. Diamonds, high-technology\r\n  equipment, and agricultural products (fruits and vegetables) are\r\n  leading exports. Israel usually posts current account deficits,\r\n  which are covered by large transfer payments from abroad and by\r\n  foreign loans. Roughly half of the government's external debt is\r\n  owed to the US, which is its major source of economic and military\r\n  aid. To earn needed foreign exchange, Israel has been targeting\r\n  high-technology niches in international markets, such as medical\r\n  scanning equipment. The influx of Jewish immigrants from the former\r\n  USSR, which topped 525,000 during the period 1990-95, increased\r\n  unemployment, intensified housing problems, and strained the\r\n  government budget. At the same time, the immigrants bring to the\r\n  economy valuable scientific and professional expertise.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $80.1 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 7.1% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $15,500 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 3.5%\r\n  industry: 22%\r\n  services: 74.5%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 10.1% (1995)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 1.9 million (1992)\r\n  by occupation: public services 29.3%, industry 22.1%, commerce\r\n  13.9%, finance and business 10.4%, personal and other services 7.4%,\r\n  construction 6.5%, transport, storage, and communications 6.3%,\r\n  agriculture, forestry, and fishing 3.5%, other 0.6% (1992)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 6.3% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $41 billion\r\n  expenditures: $53 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1996)\r\n\r\nIndustries: food processing, diamond cutting and polishing,\r\n  textiles and apparel, chemicals, metal products, military equipment,\r\n  transport equipment, electrical equipment, potash mining,\r\n  high-technology electronics, tourism\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 10.3% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 4,140,000 kW\r\n  production: 23 billion kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 4,290 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: citrus and other fruits, vegetables, cotton;

The country is still divided into a developed\r\n  industrial north, dominated by private companies, and an undeveloped\r\n  agricultural south, dominated by large public enterprises. Most raw\r\n  materials needed by industry and over 75% of energy requirements\r\n  must be imported. In the second half of 1992, Rome became unsettled\r\n  by the prospect of not qualifying to participate in EU plans for\r\n  economic and monetary union later in the decade; thus, it finally\r\n  began to address its huge fiscal imbalances. Subsequently, the\r\n  government has adopted fairly stringent budgets, abandoned its\r\n  inflationary wage indexation system, and started to scale back its\r\n  generous social welfare programs, including pension and health care\r\n  benefits. Monetary officials were forced to withdraw the lira from\r\n  the European monetary system in September 1992, when it came under\r\n  extreme pressure in currency markets. For the 1990s, Italy faces the\r\n  problems of pushing ahead with fiscal reform, refurbishing a\r\n  tottering communications system, curbing pollution in major\r\n  industrial centers, and adjusting to the new competitive forces\r\n  accompanying the ongoing expansion and economic integration of the\r\n  EU.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $1.0886 trillion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 3.2% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $18,700 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 2.9%\r\n  industry: 31.6%\r\n  services: 65.5% (1994)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 5.4% (1995)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 23.988 million\r\n  by occupation: services 58%, industry 32.2%, agriculture 9.8% (1988)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 12.2% (January 1995)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $339 billion\r\n  expenditures: $431 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: tourism, machinery, iron and steel, chemicals, food\r\n  processing, textiles, motor vehicles, clothing, footwear, ceramics\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 5.5% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 61,630,000 kW\r\n  production: 209 billion kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 4,033 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: fruits, vegetables, grapes, potatoes, sugar beets,\r\n  soybeans, grain, olives;

One notable characteristic of the economy is the\r\n  working together of manufacturers, suppliers, and distributors in\r\n  closely knit groups called keiretsu. A second basic feature has been\r\n  the guarantee of lifetime employment for a substantial portion of\r\n  the urban labor force; this guarantee is slowly eroding. Industry,\r\n  the most important sector of the economy, is heavily dependent on\r\n  imported raw materials and fuels. The much smaller agricultural\r\n  sector is highly subsidized and protected, with crop yields among\r\n  the highest in the world. Usually self-sufficient in rice, Japan\r\n  must import about 50% of its requirements of other grain and fodder\r\n  crops. Japan maintains one of the world's largest fishing fleets and\r\n  accounts for nearly 15% of the global catch. For three decades\r\n  overall economic growth had been spectacular: a 10% average in the\r\n  1960s, a 5% average in the 1970s and 1980s. Growth came to a halt in\r\n  1992-95 largely because of the aftereffects of overinvestment during\r\n  the late 1980s and contractionary domestic policies intended to\r\n  wring speculative excesses from the stock and real estate markets.\r\n  At yearend 1995, the financial structure is shaky with banks holding\r\n  hundreds of billions of dollars of suspect assets. At the same time,\r\n  the continued basic strength of the economy has been reflected in\r\n  substantial trade surpluses, sizable foreign investments, and\r\n  remarkably low rates of unemployment, inflation, and social\r\n  disorder. The crowding of the habitable land area and the aging of\r\n  the population are two major long-run problems.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $2.6792 trillion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 0.3% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $21,300 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 2.1%\r\n  industry: 40.2%\r\n  services: 57.7% (1994)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): -0.1% (1995)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 65.87 million (December 1994)\r\n  by occupation: trade and services 54%, manufacturing, mining, and\r\n  construction 33%, agriculture, forestry, and fishing 7%, government\r\n  3%, other 3% (1988)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 3.1% (1995)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $595 billion\r\n  expenditures: $829 billion, including capital expenditures (public\r\n  works only) of about $122 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: among world's largest and technologically advanced\r\n  producers of steel and non-ferrous metallurgy, heavy electrical\r\n  equipment, construction and mining equipment, motor vehicles and\r\n  parts, electronic and telecommunication equipment, machine tools,\r\n  automated production systems, locomotives and railroad rolling\r\n  stock, ships, chemicals;

Potatoes, cauliflower, tomatoes,\r\n  and especially flowers are important export crops, shipped mostly to\r\n  the UK. The Jersey breed of dairy cattle is known worldwide and\r\n  represents an important export earner. Milk products go to the UK\r\n  and other EU countries. In 1986 the finance sector overtook tourism\r\n  as the main contributor to GDP, accounting for 40% of the island's\r\n  output. In recent years, the government has encouraged light\r\n  industry to locate in Jersey, with the result that an electronics\r\n  industry has developed alongside the traditional manufacturing of\r\n  knitwear.

In the remainder of the 1980s, however, reductions in\r\n  both Arab aid and worker remittances slowed real economic growth to\r\n  an average of roughly 2% per year. Imports - mainly oil, capital\r\n  goods, consumer durables, and food - outstripped exports, with the\r\n  difference covered by aid, remittances, and borrowing. In mid-1989,\r\n  the Jordanian Government began debt-rescheduling negotiations and\r\n  agreed to implement an IMF-supported program designed to gradually\r\n  reduce the budget deficit and implement badly needed structural\r\n  reforms. The Persian Gulf crisis that began in August 1990, however,\r\n  aggravated Jordan's already serious economic problems, forcing the\r\n  government to shelve the IMF program, stop most debt payments, and\r\n  suspend rescheduling negotiations. Aid from Gulf Arab states, worker\r\n  remittances, and trade contracted; and refugees flooded the country,\r\n  producing serious balance-of-payments problems, stunting GDP growth,\r\n  and straining government resources. The economy rebounded in 1992,\r\n  largely due to the influx of capital repatriated by workers\r\n  returning from the Gulf, but the recovery was uneven throughout 1994\r\n  and 1995. The government is implementing the reform program adopted\r\n  in 1992 and continues to secure rescheduling and write-offs of its\r\n  heavy foreign debt. Debt, poverty, and unemployment remain Jordan's\r\n  biggest on-going problems.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $19.3 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 6.5% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $4,700 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 11%\r\n  industry: 25%\r\n  services: 64% (1994)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 3% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 600,000 (1992)\r\n  by occupation: industry 11.4%, commerce, restaurants, and hotels\r\n  10.5%, construction 10.0%, transport and communications 8.7%,\r\n  agriculture 7.4%, other services 52.0% (1992)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 16% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $2.5 billion\r\n  expenditures: $2.5 billion, including capital expenditures of $640\r\n  million (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: phosphate mining, petroleum refining, cement, potash,\r\n  light manufacturing\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 5.6% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 1,050,000 kW\r\n  production: 4.2 billion kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 1,072 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: wheat, barley, citrus, tomatoes, melons, olives;\r\n  sheep, goats, poultry\r\n\r\nExports: $1.7 billion (f.o.b., 1994)\r\n  commodities: phosphates, fertilizers, potash, agricultural products,\r\n  manufactures\r\n  partners: India, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, EU, Indonesia, UAE\r\n\r\nImports: $3.8 billion (c.i.f., 1994)\r\n  commodities: crude oil, machinery, transport equipment, food, live\r\n  animals, manufactured goods\r\n  partners: EU, US, Iraq, Japan, Turkey\r\n\r\nExternal debt: $6.9 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nEconomic aid:\r\n  recipient: ODA, $238 million (1993)\r\n\r\nCurrency: 1 Jordanian dinar (JD) = 1,000 fils\r\n\r\nExchange rates: Jordanian dinars (JD) per US$1 - 0.7090 (January\r\n  1996), 0.7005 (1995), 0.6987 (1994), 0.6928 (1993), 0.6797 (1992),\r\n  0.6808 (1991)\r\n\r\nFiscal year: calendar year\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTransportation\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n\r\nRailways:\r\n  total: 676 km\r\n  narrow gauge: 676 km 1.050-m gauge;

Kazakstan's\r\n  industrial sector rests on the extraction and processing of these\r\n  natural resources and also on a relatively large machine building\r\n  sector specializing in construction equipment, tractors,\r\n  agricultural machinery, and some defense items. The breakup of the\r\n  USSR and the collapse of demand for Kazakstan's traditional heavy\r\n  industry products have resulted in a sharp contraction of the\r\n  economy since 1991, with the steepest annual decline occurring in\r\n  1994. The government has pursued a moderate program of economic\r\n  reform and privatization, resulting in a gradual lifting of state\r\n  controls over economic activity and a shifting of assets into the\r\n  private sector. Nevertheless, government control over key sectors of\r\n  the economy remains strong. Moreover, continued lack of pipeline\r\n  transportation for expanded oil exports has closed off a likely\r\n  source of economic recovery.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $46.9 billion (1995 estimate as\r\n  extrapolated from World Bank estimate for 1994)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: -8.9% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $2,700 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 28.5%\r\n  industry: 41.5%\r\n  services: 30% (1991 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 60.3% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 7.356 million\r\n  by occupation: industry and construction 31%, agriculture and\r\n  forestry 26%, other 43% (1992)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 1.4% includes only officially registered\r\n  unemployed;

Population growth\r\n  has been accompanied by deforestation, deterioration in the road\r\n  system, the water supply, and other parts of the infrastructure. In\r\n  industry and services, Nairobi's reluctance to embrace IMF-supported\r\n  reforms had held back investment and growth in 1991-93. Nairobi's\r\n  push on economic reform in 1994, however, helped support a 3.3%\r\n  increase in output.

Commercially viable phosphate\r\n  deposits were exhausted at the time of independence in 1979. Copra\r\n  and fish now represent the bulk of production and exports. The\r\n  economy has fluctuated widely in recent years. Real GDP growth has\r\n  declined from about 10% in 1988 to about 2.6% in 1995. Economic\r\n  development is constrained by a shortage of skilled workers, weak\r\n  infrastructure, and remoteness from international markets. The\r\n  financial sector is at an early stage of development. Foreign\r\n  financial aid, largely from the UK and Japan, is a critical\r\n  supplement to GDP, equal in amount to 25%-50% of GDP in recent years.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $68 million (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 2.6% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $860 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: NA%\r\n  industry: NA%\r\n  services: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 5.5% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 7,870 economically active, not including subsistence\r\n  farmers (1985 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 2%;

agricultural land is collectivized; and state-owned\r\n  industry produces 95% of manufactured goods. State control of\r\n  economic affairs is unusually tight even for a communist country\r\n  because of the small size and homogeneity of the society and the\r\n  strict rule of KIM Il-song in the past and now his son, KIM\r\n  Chong-il. Economic growth during the period 1984-88 averaged 2%-3%,\r\n  but output declined by an average of 4%-5% annually during 1989-95\r\n  because of systemic problems and disruptions in socialist-style\r\n  economic relations and technological links with the former USSR and\r\n  China. The leadership has insisted on maintaining its high level of\r\n  military outlays from a shrinking economic pie. Moreover, a serious\r\n  drawdown in inventories and critical shortages in the energy sector\r\n  have led to increasing interruptions in industrial production.\r\n  Abundant mineral resources and hydropower have formed the basis of\r\n  industrial development since World War II. Manufacturing is centered\r\n  on heavy industry, including military industry, with light industry\r\n  lagging far behind. Despite the use of improved seed varieties,\r\n  expansion of irrigation, and the heavy use of fertilizers, North\r\n  Korea has not yet become self-sufficient in food production. Indeed,\r\n  a shortage of arable lands, several years of poor harvests, and a\r\n  cumbersome distribution system have resulted in chronic food\r\n  shortages. The year 1995 was marked by serious summer floods that\r\n  worsened an already tenuous food situation. Substantial grain\r\n  shipments from Japan and South Korea offset a portion of the losses.\r\n  North Korea remains far behind South Korea in economic development\r\n  and living standards.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $21.5 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: -5% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $920 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 25%\r\n  industry: 60%\r\n  services: 15% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): NA%\r\n\r\nLabor force: 9.615 million\r\n  by occupation: agricultural 36%, nonagricultural 64%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $19.3 billion\r\n  expenditures: $19.3 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: military products;

Three decades ago\r\n  its GDP per capita was comparable with levels in the poorer\r\n  countries of Africa and Asia. Today its GDP per capita is nine times\r\n  India's, 14 times North Korea's, and already up with the lesser\r\n  economies of the European Union. This success has been achieved by a\r\n  unique combination of authoritarian government guidance of what is\r\n  at bottom an essentially entrepreneurial process. The government has\r\n  sponsored large-scale adoption of technology and management from\r\n  Japan and other modern nations; has successfully pushed the\r\n  development of export industries while encouraging the import of\r\n  machinery and materials at the expense of consumer goods; and has\r\n  pushed its labor force to a work effort seldom matched anywhere even\r\n  in wartime. Real GDP grew by an average 10% in 1986-91, then paused\r\n  to a \"mere\" 5% in 1992-93, only to move back up to 8% in 1994 and 9%\r\n  in 1995. With a much higher standard of living and with a\r\n  considerable easing of authoritarian controls, the work pace has\r\n  softened. Growth rates will probably slow down over the medium term\r\n  because of the exhaustion of former growth opportunities and the\r\n  need to deal with pollution and the other problems of success.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $590.7 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 9% (1995)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $13,000 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 8%\r\n  industry: 45%\r\n  services: 47% (1991 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 4.3% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 20 million\r\n  by occupation: services and other 52%, mining and manufacturing 27%,\r\n  agriculture, fishing, forestry 21% (1991)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 2% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $69 billion\r\n  expenditures: $67 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: electronics, automobile production, chemicals,\r\n  shipbuilding, steel, textiles, clothing, footwear, food processing\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 12.2% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 28,750,000 kW\r\n  production: 165 billion kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 2,899 kWh (1994)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: rice, root crops, barley, vegetables, fruit;

Kuwait has rebuilt its war-ravaged petroleum sector;\r\n  its crude oil production averaged 2.0 million barrels per day in\r\n  1994. The government continues to record large fiscal deficits.\r\n  Petroleum accounts for nearly half of GDP, 90% of export revenues,\r\n  and 70% of government income. Kuwait lacks water and has practically\r\n  no arable land, thus preventing development of agriculture. With the\r\n  exception of fish, it depends almost wholly on food imports. About\r\n  75% of potable water must be distilled or imported. Because of its\r\n  high per capita income, comparable with Western European incomes,\r\n  Kuwait provides its citizens with extensive health, educational, and\r\n  retirement benefits. Per capita military expenditures are among the\r\n  highest in the world. The economy improved moderately in 1994-95,\r\n  with the growth in industry and finance. The World Bank has urged\r\n  Kuwait to push ahead with privatization, including in the oil\r\n  industry, but the government will move slowly on this front.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $30.8 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 3% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $17,000 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 0%\r\n  industry: 55%\r\n  services: 45%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 5% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 1 million (1994 est.)\r\n  by occupation: industry and agriculture 25.0%, services 25.0%,\r\n  government and social services 50.0%\r\n  note: 80% of labor force non-Kuwaiti (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NEGL% (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $9.7 billion\r\n  expenditures: $14.2 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (FY95/96 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: petroleum, petrochemicals, desalination, food\r\n  processing, construction materials, salt, construction\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 1% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 7,070,000 kW\r\n  production: 11 billion kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 6,007 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: practically no crops;

Cotton, wool, and\r\n  meat are the main agricultural products and exports. Industrial\r\n  exports included gold, mercury, uranium, and hydropower. Kyrgyzstan\r\n  has been one of the most progressive countries of the former Soviet\r\n  Union in carrying out market reforms. Following a successful\r\n  stabilization program, which has lowered inflation from 88% in 1994\r\n  to 32% for 1995, attention is turning toward stimulating growth.\r\n  About half of government stock in enterprises has been sold. Drops\r\n  in production have been severe since the break up of the Soviet\r\n  Union, but by mid-1995 production began to level off as exports\r\n  began to increase. The level of hardship for pensioners, unemployed\r\n  workers, and government workers with salaries arrears continues to\r\n  be very high. Foreign assistance plays a substantial role in the\r\n  country's budget. In early 1996, the economy apparently is slowly\r\n  beginning to restore previous levels of output.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $5.4 billion (1995 estimate as\r\n  extrapolated from World Bank estimate for 1994)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: -6% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $1,140 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: NA%\r\n  industry: NA%\r\n  services: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 32% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 1.836 million\r\n  by occupation: agriculture and forestry 38%, industry and\r\n  construction 21%, other 41% (1990)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 4.8% includes officially registered unemployed;\r\n  also large numbers of unregistered unemployed and underemployed\r\n  workers (December 1995)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $NA\r\n  expenditures: $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n\r\nIndustries: small machinery, textiles, food processing, cement,\r\n  shoes, sawn logs, refrigerators, furniture, electric motors, gold,\r\n  rare earth metals\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: -12.5% (1995)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 3,660,000 kW\r\n  production: 12.3 billion kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 2,500 kWh (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: wool, tobacco, cotton, potatoes, vegetables, grapes,\r\n  fruits and berries;

The results,\r\n  starting from an extremely low base, have been striking - growth has\r\n  averaged 7.5% annually since 1988. Even so, Laos is a landlocked\r\n  country with a primitive infrastructure. It has no railroads, a\r\n  rudimentary road system, and limited external and internal\r\n  telecommunications. Electricity is available in only a few urban\r\n  areas. Subsistence agriculture accounts for half of GDP and provides\r\n  80% of total employment. The predominant crop is rice. In\r\n  non-drought years, Laos is self-sufficient overall in food, but each\r\n  year flood, pests, and localized drought cause shortages in various\r\n  parts of the country. For the foreseeable future the economy will\r\n  continue to depend on aid from the IMF and other international\r\n  sources; aid from the former USSR/Eastern Europe has been cut\r\n  sharply. As in many developing countries, deforestation and soil\r\n  erosion will hamper efforts to maintain the high rate of GDP growth.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $5.2 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 8% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $1,100 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 50%\r\n  industry: 17%\r\n  services: 33% (1993)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 20% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 1 million-1.5 million\r\n  by occupation: agriculture 80% (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 21% (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $198 million\r\n  expenditures: $351 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1994)\r\n\r\nIndustries: tin and gypsum mining, timber, electric power,\r\n  agricultural processing, construction\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 7.5% (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 260,000 kW\r\n  production: 870 million kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 44 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: sweet potatoes, vegetables, corn, coffee, sugarcane,\r\n  cotton;

The government's attempts to compensate depositors of\r\n  failed banks exacerbated an existing budget shortfall; poor revenue\r\n  collection and a soft treasury bill market had already caused the\r\n  government to incur a larger than expected deficit early in the\r\n  year. As a result of the crises, Latvia's budget deficit for 1995\r\n  was $168 million, double that originally planned. In addition, GDP\r\n  growth came to a halt. The Central Bank maintained its tough\r\n  monetary policies - severely limiting credits to the state, despite\r\n  the budget problems - helping to keep annual inflation the lowest\r\n  among the Baltic states, at about 20%.

Under the\r\nTa'if accord - the blueprint for national reconciliation - the\r\nLebanese have established a more equitable political system,\r\nparticularly by giving Muslims a greater say in the political\r\nprocess. Since December 1990, the Lebanese have formed four cabinets\r\nand conducted the first legislative election in 20 years. Most of\r\nthe militias have been weakened or disbanded. The Lebanese Armed\r\nForces (LAF) has seized vast quantities of weapons used by the\r\nmilitias during the war and extended central government authority\r\nover about one-half of the country. Hizballah, the radical Shi'a\r\nparty, retains most of its weapons. Foreign forces still occupy\r\nareas of Lebanon. Israel maintains troops in southern Lebanon and\r\ncontinues to support a proxy militia, The Army of South Lebanon\r\n(ASL), along a narrow stretch of territory contiguous to its border.\r\nThe ASL's enclave encompasses this self-declared security zone and\r\nabout 20 kilometers north to the strategic town of Jazzin. Syria\r\nmaintains about 30,000 troops in Lebanon. These troops are based\r\nmainly in Beirut, North Lebanon, and the Bekaa Valley. Syria's\r\ndeployment was legitimized by the Arab League early in Lebanon's\r\ncivil war and in the Ta'if accord. Citing the continued weakness of\r\nthe LAF, Beirut's requests, and failure of the Lebanese Government\r\nto implement all of the constitutional reforms in the Ta'if accord,\r\nDamascus has so far refused to withdraw its troops from Beirut.\r\n\r\nMap\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation: 33 50 N, 35 50 E -- Middle East, bordering the\r\n  Mediterranean Sea, between Israel and Syria\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFlag\r\n----\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription: three horizontal bands of red (top), white (double\r\n  width), and red with a green and brown cedar tree centered in the\r\n  white band\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeography\r\n---------\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation: Middle East, bordering the Mediterranean Sea, between\r\n  Israel and Syria\r\n\r\nGeographic coordinates: 33 50 N, 35 50 E\r\n\r\nMap references: Middle East\r\n\r\nArea:\r\n  total area: 10,400 sq km\r\n  land area: 10,230 sq km\r\n  comparative area: about 0.8 times the size of Connecticut\r\n\r\nLand boundaries:\r\n  total: 454 km\r\n  border countries: Israel 79 km, Syria 375 km\r\n\r\nCoastline: 225 km\r\n\r\nMaritime claims:\r\n  territorial sea: 12 nm\r\n\r\nInternational disputes: Israeli troops in southern Lebanon since\r\n  June 1982;

Peace has enabled the central government to restore\r\n  control in Beirut, begin collecting taxes, and regain access to key\r\n  port and government facilities. Economic recovery has been helped by\r\n  a financially sound banking system and resilient small- and\r\n  medium-scale manufacturers. Family remittances, banking services,\r\n  manufactured and farm exports, and international aid are the main\r\n  sources of foreign exchange. In the relatively settled year of 1991,\r\n  industrial production, agricultural output, and exports showed\r\n  substantial gains. The rebuilding of the war-ravaged country was\r\n  delayed in 1992 because of an upturn in political wrangling. In\r\n  October 1992, Rafiq al-HARIRI was appointed prime minister. A\r\n  billionaire entrepreneur, al-HARIRI, announced ambitious plans for\r\n  Lebanon's reconstruction, which involve a substantial influx of\r\n  foreign aid and investment. The economy has posted considerable\r\n  gains since 1992, with GDP rebounding, inflation falling, and\r\n  foreign capital inflows jumping. Signs of strain have emerged in\r\n  recent years, however, as the government budget deficit has risen\r\n  and grassroots economic dissatisfaction has grown. Meantime, the\r\n  future fate of Lebanon and its economy is being determined largely\r\n  by outside forces - in Syria, other Arab nations, Israel, and the\r\n  West.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $18.3 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 6.5% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $4,900 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 13%\r\n  industry: 28%\r\n  services: 59% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 9% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 650,000\r\n  by occupation: services 60%, industry 28%, agriculture 12% (1990\r\n  est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 30% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $1.4 billion\r\n  expenditures: $3.2 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: banking, food processing, textiles, cement, oil\r\n  refining, chemicals, jewelry, some metal fabricating\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 1,220,000 kW\r\n  production: 2.5 billion kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 676 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: citrus, vegetables, potatoes, olives, tobacco, hemp\r\n  (hashish);

Its economy is\r\n  based on agriculture, light manufacturing, and remittances from\r\n  laborers employed in South Africa (these remittances supplement\r\n  domestic income by as much as 45%). The great majority of households\r\n  gain their livelihoods from subsistence farming and migrant labor; a\r\n  large portion of the adult male work force is employed in South\r\n  African mines. Manufacturing depends largely on farm products which\r\n  support the milling, canning, leather, and jute industries. Although\r\n  drought has decreased agricultural activity over the past few years,\r\n  improvement of a major hydropower facility will permit the sale of\r\n  water to South Africa and will support the economy's continued\r\n  expansion.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $2.8 billion (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 13.5% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $1,430 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 10.4%\r\n  industry: 48.8%\r\n  services: 40.8% (1993)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 9.5% (January 1995)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 689,000 economically active\r\n  by occupation: 86.2% of resident population engaged in subsistence\r\n  agriculture; roughly 60% of the active male wage earners work in\r\n  South Africa\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: substantial unemployment and underemployment\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $445 million\r\n  expenditures: $400 million, including capital expenditures of $128\r\n  million (FY94/95 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: food, beverages, textiles, handicrafts; construction;\r\n  tourism\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 12.5% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity: power supplied by South Africa\r\n\r\nAgriculture: corn, wheat, pulses, sorghum, barley; livestock\r\n\r\nExports: $142 million (f.o.b., 1994 est.)\r\n  commodities: clothing, furniture, footwear, wool\r\n  partners: South Africa 39%, EC 22%, North and South America 33%\r\n  (1993)\r\n\r\nImports: $1 billion (c.i.f., 1994 est.)\r\n  commodities: mainly corn, building materials, clothing, vehicles,\r\n  machinery, medicines, petroleum products\r\n  partners: South Africa 83%, Asia 12%, EC 3% (1993)\r\n\r\nExternal debt: $512 million (1993)\r\n\r\nEconomic aid:\r\n  recipient: ODA, $NA\r\n\r\nCurrency: 1 loti (L) = 100 lisente\r\n\r\nExchange rates: maloti (M) per US$1 - 3.6417 (January 1996),\r\n  3.6266 (1995), 3.5490 (1994), 3.2636 (1993), 2.8497 (1992), 2.7563\r\n  (1991); note - the Basotho loti is at par with the South African rand\r\n\r\nFiscal year: 1 April - 31 March\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTransportation\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n\r\nRailways:\r\n  total: 2.6 km; note - owned by, operated by, and included in the\r\n  statistics of South Africa\r\n  narrow gauge: 2.6 km 1.067-m gauge\r\n\r\nHighways:\r\n  total: 5,324 km\r\n  paved: 799 km\r\n  unpaved: 4,525 km (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nPorts: none\r\n\r\nAirports:\r\n  total: 29\r\n  with paved runways over 3 047 m: 1\r\n  with paved runways 914 to 1 523 m: 1\r\n  with paved runways under 914 m: 23\r\n  with unpaved runways 914 to 1 523 m: 4 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommunications\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n\r\nTelephones: 12,000 (1991 est.)\r\n\r\nTelephone system: rudimentary system\r\n  domestic: consists of a few landlines, a small microwave radio relay\r\n  system, and a minor radiotelephone communication system\r\n  international: satellite earth station - 1 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean)\r\n\r\nRadio broadcast stations: AM 3, FM 4, shortwave 0\r\n\r\nRadios: 66,000\r\n\r\nTelevision broadcast stations: 1\r\n\r\nTelevisions: 11,000 (1992 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDefense\r\n-------\r\n\r\n\r\nBranches: Lesotho Defense Force (LDF; includes Army and Air Wing),\r\n  Lesotho Mounted Police\r\n\r\nManpower availability:\r\n  males age 15-49: 455,218\r\n  males fit for military service: 245,774 (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nDefense expenditures: $NA, NA% of GDP\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n======================================================================\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n@Liberia\r\n-------\r\n\r\n\r\nYears of civil strife have destroyed much of Liberia's economic\r\ninfrastructure, made civil administration nearly impossible, and\r\nbrought economic activity virtually to a halt. The deterioration of\r\neconomic conditions has been greatly exacerbated by the flight of\r\nmost business people with their expertise and capital. Civil order\r\nended in 1990 when President Samuel Kanyon DOE was killed by rebel\r\nforces. The ensuing civil war persisted until August 1995 when the\r\nmajor factions signed the Abuja peace accord and, in September 1995,\r\nformed a transitional coalition government under Wilton SANKAWULO.\r\nThe war was resumed in April 1996, when forces loyal to faction\r\nleaders Charles TAYLOR and Alhaji KROMAH attacked rival factions in\r\nMonrovia, further damaging the capital's already dilapidated\r\ninfrastructure and causing panic among the remaining foreign\r\nresidents, thousands of whom sought refuge in US facilities.\r\nProspects for peace became extremely uncertain again.\r\n\r\nMap\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation: 6 30 N, 9 30 W -- Western Africa, bordering the North\r\n  Atlantic Ocean, between Cote d'Ivoire and Sierra Leone\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFlag\r\n----\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription: 11 equal horizontal stripes of red (top and bottom)\r\n  alternating with white;

Businessmen have fled the country, taking capital and\r\n  expertise with them. Many will not return. Richly endowed with\r\n  water, mineral resources, forests, and a climate favorable to\r\n  agriculture, Liberia had been a producer and exporter of basic\r\n  products, while local manufacturing, mainly foreign owned, had been\r\n  small in scope.

In 1990\r\n  per capita GDP was the highest in Africa at $5,410, but subsequently\r\n  GDP growth has slowed on average and has fluctuated sharply in\r\n  response to changes in the world oil market. Import restrictions and\r\n  inefficient resource allocations have led to periodic shortages of\r\n  basic goods and foodstuffs. The nonoil manufacturing and\r\n  construction sectors, which account for about 20% of GDP, have\r\n  expanded from processing mostly agricultural products to include the\r\n  production of petrochemicals, iron, steel, and aluminum. Although\r\n  agriculture accounts for only 5% of GDP, it employs 18% of the labor\r\n  force. Climatic conditions and poor soils severely limit farm\r\n  output, and Libya imports about 75% of its food requirements. The UN\r\n  sanctions imposed in April 1992 have not yet had a major impact on\r\n  the economy because Libya's oil revenues generate sufficient foreign\r\n  exchange to sustain imports of food, consumer goods, and equipment\r\n  for the oil industry and ongoing development projects.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $32.9 billion (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: -0.9% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $6,510 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: NA%\r\n  industry: NA%\r\n  services: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 25% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 1 million (includes about 280,000 resident foreigners)\r\n  by occupation: industry 31%, services 27%, government 24%,\r\n  agriculture 18%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $8.1 billion\r\n  expenditures: $9.8 billion, including capital expenditures of $3.1\r\n  billion (1989 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: petroleum, food processing, textiles, handicrafts,\r\n  cement\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 4,600,000 kW\r\n  production: 16.1 billion kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 3,078 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: wheat, barley, olives, dates, citrus, vegetables,\r\n  peanuts;

With the help of the IMF and other\r\n  international institutions, the government has adopted a disciplined\r\n  program to restrain inflation, reduce price controls, lower the\r\n  budget deficit and privatize the economy. Lithuania has embarked on\r\n  a series of price liberalizations; most price controls have been\r\n  abolished. More than two-thirds of its industrial facilities as well\r\n  as most housing and agricultural enterprises have been privatized,\r\n  although important \"strategic\" enterprises have been exempted from\r\n  privatization - namely energy and telecommunications. While\r\n  Lithuania has reduced its trade dependence on Russia and other\r\n  republics of the FSU from 85% in 1991 to about 40% in 1995, Russia\r\n  remains Lithuania's leading trading partner. Lithuania has made\r\n  great strides in reducing its annual rate of inflation - from over\r\n  1,100% in 1992 to about 35% in 1995. Production bottomed out in\r\n  1994-95. A banking crisis beginning in September, during which\r\n  central bank reserves dropped one-third, held back growth in 1995.\r\n  If the government can stay the course on economic reform and fiscal\r\n  discipline - which may be politically difficult in the election year\r\n  of 1996 - Lithuania could be set for strong economic growth in the\r\n  near term. As for real resources, Lithuania's growth depends largely\r\n  on its ability to exploit its strategic location - with its ice-free\r\n  port at Klaipeda and its rail and highway hub in Vilnius connecting\r\n  it with Eastern Europe, Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine. Lacking\r\n  important natural resources, it will remain dependent on imports of\r\n  fuels and raw materials.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $13.3 billion (1995 estimate as\r\n  extrapolated from World Bank estimate for 1994)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 1% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $3,400 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 20%\r\n  industry: 42%\r\n  services: 38% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 35% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 1.836 million\r\n  by occupation: industry and construction 42%, agriculture and\r\n  forestry 18%, other 40% (1990)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 6.1% (January 1996)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $NA\r\n  expenditures: $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n\r\nIndustries: metal-cutting machine tools, electric motors,\r\n  television sets, refrigerators and freezers, petroleum refining,\r\n  shipbuilding (small ships), furniture making, textiles, food\r\n  processing, fertilizers, agricultural machinery, optical equipment,\r\n  electronic components, computers, amber\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 6,190,000 kW\r\n  production: 18.9 billion kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 4,608 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: grain, potatoes, sugar beets, vegetables;

Its economic decline will continue unless ties are\r\n  reforged or enlarged with its neighbors Serbia and Montenegro,\r\n  Albania, Greece, and Bulgaria. The economy depends on outside\r\n  sources for all of its oil and gas and most of its modern machinery\r\n  and parts. An important supplement of GDP is the remittances from\r\n  thousands of Macedonians working in Germany and other West European\r\n  nations. The end of sanctions on Serbia and the lifting of the Greek\r\n  embargo on Macedonia have reopened its natural trade corridors, but\r\n  the country has been slow to capitalize on these opportunities.\r\n  Moreover, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia's geographical\r\n  isolation, technological underdevelopment, and potential political\r\n  instability place it far down the list of countries of interest to\r\n  Western investors. An internal commitment to economic reform would\r\n  encourage foreign investment over the long run.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $1.9 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 4%\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $880 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 24%\r\n  industry: 44%\r\n  services: 32%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 14.8% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 591,773 (June 1994)\r\n  by occupation: manufacturing and mining 40% (1992)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 37% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $NA\r\n  expenditures: $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n\r\nIndustries: coal, metallic chromium, lead, zinc, ferronickel,\r\n  textiles, wood products, tobacco\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: -14% (1993)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 1,600,000 kW\r\n  production: 6.046 billion kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 2,941 kWh (1992)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: rice, tobacco, wheat, corn, millet, cotton, sesame,\r\n  mulberry leaves, citrus, vegetables;

Industry is largely confined to the processing of\r\n  agricultural products and textile manufacturing; it accounts for 15%\r\n  of GDP. In 1986, the government introduced a five-year development\r\n  plan that stressed self-sufficiency in food (mainly rice) by 1990,\r\n  increased production for export, and reduced energy imports.\r\n  Subsequently, growth in output has been held back because of\r\n  protracted antigovernment strikes and demonstrations for political\r\n  reform.

The economy is predominately agricultural, with\r\n  about 90% of the population living in rural areas. Agriculture\r\n  accounts for 31% of GDP and 90% of export revenues. The economy\r\n  depends on substantial inflows of economic assistance from the IMF,\r\n  the World Bank, and individual donor nations. The new government\r\n  faces strong challenges, e.g., to spur exports, to improve\r\n  educational and health facilities, and to deal with environmental\r\n  problems of deforestation and erosion. Drought hurt the 1994\r\n  economy, with GDP down by 12.4%. Good weather and a strong tobacco\r\n  crop resulted in an upturn in 1995.

In 1994,\r\n  tourism, Maldives largest industry, accounted for about 18% of GDP\r\n  and more than 60% of the Maldives' foreign exchange receipts.\r\n  Fishing is a second leading growth sector. Over 90% of government\r\n  tax revenue comes from import duties and tourism-related taxes. The\r\n  Maldivian Government initiated an economic reform program in 1989\r\n  initially by lifting import quotas and opening some exports to the\r\n  private sector. Subsequently, it has liberalized regulations to\r\n  allow more foreign investment. Agriculture and manufacturing\r\n  continue to play a minor role in the economy, constrained by the\r\n  limited availability of cultivable land and the shortage of domestic\r\n  labor.

Agricultural production is concentrated on small farms,\r\n  and the most important commercial crops are coconuts, tomatoes,\r\n  melons, and breadfruit. A few cattle ranches supply the domestic\r\n  meat market. Small-scale industry is limited to handicrafts, fish\r\n  processing, and copra. The tourist industry is the primary source of\r\n  foreign exchange and employs about 10% of the labor force. The\r\n  islands have few natural resources, and imports far exceed exports.\r\n  The government is drafting economic reforms designed to increase\r\n  revenue and compensate for reductions in US Government grants - in\r\n  1994, the US Government provided grants of $50 million, equal to 55%\r\n  of the Marshall Islands' GDP.

Agriculture accounts for about 6% of\r\n  GDP and the small industrial sector for 11%. Sugar production has\r\n  declined, with most of the sugarcane now used for the production of\r\n  rum. Banana exports are increasing, going mostly to France. The bulk\r\n  of meat, vegetable, and grain requirements must be imported,\r\n  contributing to a chronic trade deficit that requires large annual\r\n  transfers of aid from France. Tourism has become more important than\r\n  agricultural exports as a source of foreign exchange. The majority\r\n  of the work force is employed in the service sector and in\r\n  administration. Banana workers launched protests late in 1992\r\n  because of falling banana prices and fears of greater competition in\r\n  the European market from other producers.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $3.95 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $10,000 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 6%\r\n  industry: 11%\r\n  services: 83% (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 3.9% (1990)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 121,600\r\n  by occupation: agriculture 10%, industry 17%, services 73% (1992)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 32.1% (1990)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $657 million\r\n  expenditures: $2.2 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: construction, rum, cement, oil refining, sugar, tourism\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 113,100 kW\r\n  production: 761 million kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 1,677 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: pineapples, avocados, bananas, flowers, vegetables,\r\n  sugarcane for rum\r\n\r\nIllicit drugs: transshipment point for cocaine and marijuana bound\r\n  for the US and Europe\r\n\r\nExports: $218 million (f.o.b., 1993)\r\n  commodities: refined petroleum products, bananas, rum, pineapples\r\n  partners: France 57%, Guadeloupe 31%, French Guiana (1991)\r\n\r\nImports: $1.76 billion (c.i.f., 1993)\r\n  commodities: petroleum products, crude oil, foodstuffs, construction\r\n  materials, vehicles, clothing and other consumer goods\r\n  partners: France 62%, UK, Italy, Germany, Japan, US (1991)\r\n\r\nExternal debt: $180 million (1994)\r\n\r\nEconomic aid:\r\n  recipient: ODA, $NA\r\n  note: French aid $600 million (1989-93);

Mauritania has extensive\r\n  deposits of iron ore, which account for almost 50% of total exports.\r\n  The decline in world demand for this ore, however, has led to\r\n  cutbacks in production. The nation's coastal waters are among the\r\n  richest fishing areas in the world, but overexploitation by\r\n  foreigners threatens this key source of revenue. The country's first\r\n  deepwater port opened near Nouakchott in 1986. In recent years,\r\n  drought and economic mismanagement have resulted in a substantial\r\n  buildup of foreign debt. The government has begun the second stage\r\n  of an economic reform program in consultation with the World Bank,\r\n  the IMF, and major donor countries. Short-term growth prospects are\r\n  gloomy because of the heavy debt service burden, rapid population\r\n  growth, and vulnerability to climatic conditions.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $2.8 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 4% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $1,200 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 27.1%\r\n  industry: 29.5%\r\n  services: 43.4% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 3.5% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 465,000 (1981 est.);

For most of the period, annual growth has been of the order\r\n  of 5% to 6%. This remarkable achievement has been reflected in\r\n  increased life expectancy, lowered infant mortality, and a much\r\n  improved infrastructure. Sugarcane is grown on about 90% of the\r\n  cultivated land area and accounts for 40% of export earnings. The\r\n  government's development strategy centers on industrialization (with\r\n  a view to modernization and to exports), agricultural\r\n  diversification, and tourism.

Mexico entered 1996 on the heels of\r\n  its worst recession since the 1930s. Economic activity contracted\r\n  about 7% in 1995 in the aftermath of the peso devaluation in late\r\n  1994. Although Mexico City was able to correct imbalances in its\r\n  external accounts, meet international payments obligations, and\r\n  dramatically improve its trade balance in 1995, the domestic economy\r\n  suffered harshly as the ZEDILLO administration stuck to a strict\r\n  austerity program. The tight monetary and fiscal policies helped\r\n  prevent spiraling inflation and kept government spending under\r\n  control but drove interest rates to record heights, making it\r\n  difficult for most Mexicans to service their debts. At the same\r\n  time, consumers' reduced purchasing power made buying even\r\n  necessities difficult for some. Many small- and medium-sized firms\r\n  were unable to survive under the twin burdens of high interest rates\r\n  and depressed domestic demand for their goods. Business closures and\r\n  cutbacks fueled unemployment; more than 1 million Mexicans lost\r\n  their jobs. According to the government and most private sector\r\n  observers, the recession bottomed out in the third quarter of 1995,\r\n  but the difficult year fed growing dissatisfaction with the ruling\r\n  party, led to a crisis of confidence in President ZEDILLO'S ability\r\n  to lead, and spurred increased tensions within the ruling party.\r\n  While the ZEDILLO administration is optimistic that 1996 will bring\r\n  some recovery - the government is forecasting 3% growth and 21%\r\n  inflation - Mexico will face several key vulnerabilities, including\r\n  the financial health of the banking sector, shaky investor\r\n  confidence that could be easily jarred by more political or economic\r\n  shocks, and increasingly emboldened dissenters within the ruling\r\n  party.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $721.4 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: -6.9% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $7,700 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 8.5%\r\n  industry: 28.4%\r\n  services: 63.1%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 52% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 33.6 million (1994)\r\n  by occupation: services 31.7%, agriculture, forestry, hunting, and\r\n  fishing 28%, commerce 14.6%, manufacturing 11.1%, construction 8.4%,\r\n  transportation 4.7%, mining and quarrying 1.5%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 10% (1995 est.) plus considerable\r\n  underemployment\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $56 billion (1995 est.)\r\n  expenditures: $54 billion (1995 est.), including capital\r\n  expenditures of $NA\r\n\r\nIndustries: food and beverages, tobacco, chemicals, iron and\r\n  steel, petroleum, mining, textiles, clothing, motor vehicles,\r\n  consumer durables, tourism\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: -7.5% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 28,780,000 kW\r\n  production: 122 billion kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 1,239 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: corn, wheat, soybeans, rice, beans, cotton, coffee,\r\n  fruit, tomatoes;

As a result, the economy\r\n  depends heavily on agriculture, featuring fruits, vegetables, wine,\r\n  and tobacco. Moldova must import all of its supplies of oil, coal,\r\n  and natural gas. Energy shortages have contributed to sharp\r\n  production declines since the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991.\r\n  The Moldovan Government has been making steady progress on an\r\n  ambitious economic reform agenda, and the IMF has called Moldova a\r\n  model for the region. As part of its reform efforts, Chisinau has\r\n  introduced a stable convertible currency, freed all prices, stopped\r\n  issuing preferential credits to state enterprises and backed their\r\n  steady privatization, removed export controls, and freed interest\r\n  rates. Chisinau appears strongly committed to continuing these\r\n  reforms in 1996. Published estimates probably overstated the decline\r\n  in output in 1991-94; the $2,310 per capita figure for GDP thus is a\r\n  minimum estimate.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $10.4 billion (1995 estimate\r\n  extrapolated from World Bank estimate for 1994)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: -3% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $2,310 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 33%\r\n  industry: 36%\r\n  services: 31% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 24% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 2.03 million (January 1994)\r\n  by occupation: agriculture 34.4%, industry 20.1%, other 45.5% (1985\r\n  figures)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 1.2% (includes only officially registered\r\n  unemployed;

Economic activity traditionally has been based\r\n  on agriculture and the breeding of livestock. In past years\r\n  extensive mineral resources had been developed with Soviet support;\r\n  total Soviet assistance at its height amounted to 30% of GDP. The\r\n  mining and processing of coal, copper, molybdenum, tin, tungsten,\r\n  and gold account for a large part of industrial production. Timber\r\n  and fishing are also important sectors. The Mongolian leadership has\r\n  been gradually making the transition from Soviet-style central\r\n  planning to a market economy through privatization and price reform\r\n  and has been soliciting support from international financial\r\n  agencies and foreign investors. The economy, however, has still not\r\n  recovered from the loss of Soviet aid. The country continues to\r\n  suffer substantial economic hardships, with one-fourth of the\r\n  population below the poverty line.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $4.9 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 6% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $1,970 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 28%\r\n  industry: 35%\r\n  services: 37% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 53% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 1.115 million (mid-1993 est.)\r\n  by occupation: primarily herding/agricultural\r\n  note: over half the adult population is in the labor force,\r\n  including a large percentage of women;

Tourism accounts\r\n  for roughly one-quarter of Montserrat's national income. The\r\n  island's main export is electronic components which are mainly\r\n  shipped to the US. The agriculture sector is small; cabbages,\r\n  carrots, cucumbers, and onions are grown for the domestic market;\r\n  additionally, some hot peppers and live plants are exported to the\r\n  US and Europe. The threat of a volcanic eruption in late 1995 led to\r\n  the repeated evacuation of Montserrat's capital, Plymouth, and deep\r\n  ash from the volcano destroyed much of the yearend crops.

Since the early 1980s the government has\r\n  pursued an economic program toward these objectives with the support\r\n  of the IMF, the World Bank, and the Paris Club of creditors. The\r\n  economy has substantial assets to draw on: the world's largest\r\n  phosphate reserves, diverse agricultural and fishing resources, a\r\n  sizable tourist industry, a growing manufacturing sector, and\r\n  remittances from Moroccans working abroad. A severe drought in\r\n  1992-93 depressed economic activity and held down exports. Real GDP\r\n  contracted by 4.4% in 1992 and 1.1% in 1993. Despite these setbacks,\r\n  initiatives to relax capital controls, strengthen the banking\r\n  sector, and privatize state enterprises went forward in 1993-94.\r\n  Favorable rainfall in 1994 boosted agricultural production by 40%.\r\n  In 1995, Morocco suffered from a drought said to be the worst in 30\r\n  years. Servicing the large debt, high unemployment, and\r\n  vulnerability to external economic forces remain long-term problems\r\n  for Morocco.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $87.4 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: -6.5% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $3,000 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 14.3%\r\n  industry: 32.2%\r\n  services: 53.5% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 5.4% (1994)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 7.4 million\r\n  by occupation: agriculture 50%, services 26%, industry 15%, other 9%\r\n  (1985)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 16% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $8.1 billion\r\n  expenditures: $8.9 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: phosphate rock mining and processing, food processing,\r\n  leather goods, textiles, construction, tourism\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 0.1%\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 2,620,000 kW\r\n  production: 9.9 billion kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 361 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: barley, wheat, citrus, wine, vegetables, olives;\r\n  livestock\r\n\r\nIllicit drugs: illicit producer of hashish;

Indeed,\r\n  national output, consumption, and investment declined throughout the\r\n  first half of the 1980s because of internal disorders, lack of\r\n  government administrative control, and a growing foreign debt. A\r\n  sharp increase in foreign aid, attracted by an economic reform\r\n  policy, resulted in successive years of economic growth in the late\r\n  1980s, but aid has declined steadily since 1989. Agricultural output\r\n  is at only 75% of its 1981 level, and grain has to be imported.\r\n  Industry operates at only 20%-40% of capacity. The economy depends\r\n  heavily on foreign assistance to keep afloat. Peace accords between\r\n  civil warring factions, signed in October 1992, improved chances of\r\n  foreign investment, aided IMF-supported economic reforms, and\r\n  supported continued economic recovery. Elections held in 1994\r\n  diverted government attention from the economy, resulting in\r\n  slippage and delays in the economic reform program. Nonetheless,\r\n  growth continued in 1994-95, and the economy should move forward in\r\n  the late 1990s, given continued foreign help in meeting debt\r\n  obligations. One key event in 1995 was the conclusion of\r\n  negotiations with Enron of Houston, Texas, for a $700 million\r\n  project to exploit the Pande natural gas fields.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $12.2 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: -2.5% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $700 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 33%\r\n  industry: 12%\r\n  services: 55% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 50% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: NA\r\n  by occupation: 90% engaged in agriculture\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 50% (1989 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $252 million\r\n  expenditures: $607 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: food, beverages, chemicals (fertilizer, soap, paints),\r\n  petroleum products, textiles, cement, glass, asbestos, tobacco\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 5.8% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 2,360,000 kW\r\n  production: 1.7 billion kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 58 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: cotton, cashew nuts, sugarcane, tea, cassava\r\n  (tapioca), corn, rice, tropical fruits;

Few other resources exist, so most necessities\r\n  must be imported, including fresh water from Australia. The\r\n  rehabilitation of mined land and the replacement of income from\r\n  phosphates are serious long-term problems. Substantial amounts of\r\n  phosphate income are invested in trust funds to help cushion the\r\n  transition. However, dividends from the trusts have declined sharply\r\n  since 1990 and the government has been borrowing from the trusts to\r\n  finance fiscal deficits.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $100 million (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $10,000 (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: NA%\r\n  industry: NA%\r\n  services: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): -3.6% (1993)\r\n\r\nLabor force:\r\n  by occupation: NA\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 0%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $23.8 million\r\n  expenditures: $69.2 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (FY92/93)\r\n\r\nIndustries: phosphate mining, financial services, coconut products\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 14,000 kW\r\n  production: 30 million kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 3,036 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: coconuts predominate\r\n\r\nExports: $25.3 million (f.o.b., 1991)\r\n  commodities: phosphates\r\n  partners: Australia, NZ\r\n\r\nImports: $21.1 million (c.i.f., 1991)\r\n  commodities: food, fuel, manufactures, building materials, machinery\r\n  partners: Australia, UK, NZ, Japan\r\n\r\nExternal debt: $33.3 million\r\n\r\nEconomic aid:\r\n  recipient: ODA, $NA\r\n\r\nCurrency: 1 Australian dollar ($A) = 100 cents\r\n\r\nExchange rates: Australian dollars ($A) per US$1 - 1.3477 (January\r\n  1996), 1.3486 (1995), 1.3667 (1994), 1.4704 (1993), 1.3600 (1992),\r\n  1.2834 (1991)\r\n\r\nFiscal year: 1 July - 30 June\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTransportation\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n\r\nRailways:\r\n  total: 3.9 km;

Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy,\r\n  providing a livelihood for over 80% of the population and accounting\r\n  for about one-half of GDP. Industrial activity is limited, mainly\r\n  involving the processing of agricultural produce (jute, sugarcane,\r\n  tobacco, and grain). Production of textiles and carpets has expanded\r\n  recently and accounted for 85% of foreign exchange earnings in\r\n  FY93/94. Apart from agricultural land and forests, exploitable\r\n  natural resources are mica, hydropower, and tourism. Agricultural\r\n  production in the late 1980s grew by about 5%, as compared with\r\n  annual population growth of 2.6%. More than 40% of the population is\r\n  undernourished. Since May 1991, the government has been moving\r\n  forward with economic reforms particularly those that encourage\r\n  trade and foreign investment, e.g., by eliminating business licenses\r\n  and registration requirements in order to simplify investment\r\n  procedures. The government has also been cutting public expenditures\r\n  by reducing subsidies, privatizing state industries, and laying off\r\n  civil servants. (In 1995 little progress was made in these areas\r\n  because the communist government had trouble formulating and\r\n  implementing policies.) The new coalition government is planning to\r\n  pick up the pace of reforms in 1996, focusing primarily on raising\r\n  revenues to develop the rural sector by increasing taxation and\r\n  privatization. Prospects for foreign trade and investment,\r\n  particularly in areas other than power development and tourism, will\r\n  continue to remain poor because of the small size of the economy,\r\n  its technological backwardness, its remoteness, and its\r\n  susceptibility to natural disaster. The international community\r\n  provides funding for 62% of Nepal's developmental budget and for 34%\r\n  of total budgetary expenditures.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $25.2 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 2.3% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $1,200 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 49.3%\r\n  industry: 18.4%\r\n  services: 32.3% (1993)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 6.7% (FY94/95)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 8.5 million (1991 est.)\r\n  by occupation: agriculture 93%, services 5%, industry 2%\r\n  note: severe lack of skilled labor\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%;

The government makes its presence felt,\r\n  however, through many regulations, permit requirements, and welfare\r\n  programs affecting most aspects of economic activity. The trade and\r\n  financial services sector contributes over 50% of GDP. Industrial\r\n  activity provides about 25% of GDP and is led by the\r\n  food-processing, oil-refining, and metalworking industries. The\r\n  highly mechanized agricultural sector employs only 4% of the labor\r\n  force, but provides large surpluses for export and the domestic\r\n  food-processing industry.

The government has hoped that dynamic growth would\r\n  boost real incomes, broaden and deepen the technological\r\n  capabilities of the industrial sector, reduce inflationary\r\n  pressures, and permit the expansion of welfare benefits. The initial\r\n  results were mixed: inflation is down from double-digit levels, but\r\n  growth was sluggish in 1988-91. In 1992-93, growth picked up to 3%\r\n  annually, a sign that the new economic approach was beginning to pay\r\n  off. Business confidence strengthened in 1994, and export demand\r\n  picked up in the Asia-Pacific region, resulting in 6.2% growth.\r\n  Growth continued strong in 1995, and inflation remains among the\r\n  lowest in the industrial world. The government announced its first\r\n  budget surplus in 16 years in FY94/95 and forecasts a surplus of\r\n  $5.0 billion in FY97/98.

Since March 1991, when President CHAMORRO launched an\r\n  ambitious economic stabilization program, Nicaragua has had\r\n  considerable success in reducing inflation and obtaining substantial\r\n  economic aid from abroad. Annual inflation fell from more than 750%\r\n  in 1991 to less than 5% in 1992. After rising again to an estimated\r\n  20% in 1993, the annual inflation rate was 11.7% in 1994 and 11.4%\r\n  in 1995. While economic growth was flat in 1992 and negative in\r\n  1993, the 1995 growth rate is about 4%, thanks to surges in most\r\n  export categories. Recent legislation (November 1995) authorizing\r\n  the privatization of the TELCOR telecommunications company and\r\n  resolving the issue of property confiscated by the previous\r\n  Sandinista government may reassure potential investors. The\r\n  government's efforts to liberalize trade include a December 1995\r\n  decision to stop requiring exporters to bring their foreign exchange\r\n  earnings into Nicaragua. On the debt front, the Nicaraguan\r\n  Government launched a successful debt buyback program in 1995,\r\n  purchasing 73% of its $1.373 billion commercial debt inherited from\r\n  previous governments. Progress also occurred on reducing bilateral\r\n  debt in November 1995 as Nicaragua reached an agreement with\r\n  Germany, reducing Nicaragua's $616 million debt to the former GDR by\r\n  80%. Debt reduction agreements with Paris Club creditors and\r\n  rescheduling with the US also took place. Unemployment remains a\r\n  pressing problem, however, with roughly half the country's\r\n  population unemployed or underemployed.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $7.1 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 4.2% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $1,700 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: NA%\r\n  industry: NA%\r\n  services: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 11.4% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 1.086 million\r\n  by occupation: services 43%, agriculture 44%, industry 13% (1986)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 20% substantial underemployment (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $389 million\r\n  expenditures: $551 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: food processing, chemicals, metal products, textiles,\r\n  clothing, petroleum refining and distribution, beverages, footwear\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 1.4% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 460,000 kW\r\n  production: 1.64 billion kWh (1994)\r\n  consumption per capita: 376 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: coffee, bananas, sugarcane, cotton, rice, corn,\r\n  cassava (tapioca), citrus, beans;

The economy is centered on subsistence agriculture,\r\n  animal husbandry, and reexport trade, and increasingly less on\r\n  uranium, its major export throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Uranium\r\n  revenues dropped by almost 50% between 1983 and 1990 with the end of\r\n  the uranium boom. Terms of trade with Nigeria, Niger's largest\r\n  regional trade partner, have improved dramatically since the 50%\r\n  devaluation of the African franc in January 1994; this devaluation\r\n  boosted exports of livestock, peas, onions, and the products of\r\n  Niger's small cotton industry. The government relies on bilateral\r\n  and multilateral aid for operating expenses and public investment\r\n  and is strongly induced to adhere to structural adjustment programs\r\n  designed by the IMF and the World Bank.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $5.5 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 6.7% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $600 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 38.5%\r\n  industry: 17.9%\r\n  services: 43.6% (1993)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 35.6% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 2.5 million wage earners (1982)\r\n  by occupation: agriculture 90%, industry and commerce 6%, government\r\n  4%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $188 million\r\n  expenditures: $400 million, including capital expenditures of $125\r\n  million (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: cement, brick, textiles, food processing, chemicals,\r\n  slaughterhouses, and a few other small light industries;

Nigeria's unpopular military rulers failed to make\r\n  significant progress in diversifying the economy away from\r\n  overdependence on the capital intensive oil sector which provides\r\n  almost all foreign exchange earnings and about 80% of budgetary\r\n  revenues. Regime officials also appear divided on how to redress\r\n  fundamental economic imbalances that result in troublesome\r\n  inflation, the steady depreciation of the naira, and the\r\n  discouragement of investors. The government's domestic and\r\n  international arrears continue to limit economic growth and prevent\r\n  an agreement with the IMF and bilateral creditors on debt relief.\r\n  The largely subsistence agricultural sector has failed to keep up\r\n  with rapid population growth, and Nigeria, once a large net exporter\r\n  of food, now must import food.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $135.9 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 2.6% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $1,300 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 38%\r\n  industry: 22%\r\n  services: 40% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 57% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 42.844 million\r\n  by occupation: agriculture 54%, industry, commerce, and services\r\n  19%, government 15%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 28% (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $2.7 billion\r\n  expenditures: $6.4 billion, including capital expenditures of $1.8\r\n  billion (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: crude oil, coal, tin, columbite, palm oil, peanuts,\r\n  cotton, rubber, wood, hides and skins, textiles, cement and other\r\n  construction materials, food products, footwear, chemicals,\r\n  fertilizer, printing, ceramics, steel\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 4,570,000 kW\r\n  production: 11.3 billion kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 109 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: cocoa, peanuts, palm oil, rubber, corn, rice,\r\n  sorghum, millet, cassava (tapioca), yams;

Government expenditures regularly exceed revenues, with\r\n  the shortfall made up by grants from New Zealand - the grants are\r\n  used to pay wages to public employees. The agricultural sector\r\n  consists mainly of subsistence gardening, although some cash crops\r\n  are grown for export. Industry consists primarily of small factories\r\n  to process passion fruit, lime oil, honey, and coconut cream. The\r\n  sale of postage stamps to foreign collectors is an important source\r\n  of revenue. The island in recent years has suffered a serious loss\r\n  of population because of migration of Niueans to New Zealand.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $2.4 million (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $1,200 (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: NA%\r\n  industry: NA%\r\n  services: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 5% (1992)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 1,000 (1981 est.)\r\n  by occupation: most work on family plantations;

The\r\n  government controls key areas, such as the vital petroleum sector\r\n  (through large-scale state enterprises), and extensively subsidizes\r\n  agriculture, fishing, and areas with sparse resources. Norway also\r\n  maintains an extensive welfare system that helps propel public\r\n  sector expenditures to more than 50% of GDP and results in one of\r\n  the highest average tax burdens in the world (46%). A small country\r\n  with a high dependence on international trade, Norway is basically\r\n  an exporter of raw materials and semiprocessed goods, with an\r\n  abundance of small- and medium-sized firms, and is ranked among the\r\n  major shipping nations. The country is richly endowed with natural\r\n  resources - petroleum, hydropower, fish, forests, and minerals - and\r\n  is highly dependent on its oil sector. Norway imports more than half\r\n  its food needs. Economic growth, only 1.6% in 1993, moved up to 5.5%\r\n  in 1994 and remained strong in 1995. Oslo opted to stay out of the\r\n  EU during a referendum in November 1994.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $106.2 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 4.5% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $24,500 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 2.9%\r\n  industry: 34.7%\r\n  services: 62.4% (1991)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 2.5% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 2.13 million\r\n  by occupation: services 71%, industry 23%, agriculture, forestry,\r\n  and fishing 6% (1993)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 8% (including people in job-training programs;\r\n  November 1995)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $48.6 billion\r\n  expenditures: $53 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: petroleum and gas, food processing, shipbuilding, pulp\r\n  and paper products, metals, chemicals, timber, mining, textiles,\r\n  fishing\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 7.4% (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 27,280,000 kW\r\n  production: 118 billion kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 23,735 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: oats, other grains;

Petroleum accounts for nearly 90% of\r\n  export earnings, about 75% of government revenues, and roughly 40%\r\n  of GDP. Oman has proved oil reserves of 4 billion barrels,\r\n  equivalent to about 20 years' supply at the current rate of\r\n  extraction. Agriculture is carried on at a subsistence level and the\r\n  general population depends on imported food.

trade\r\n  winds and westerly winds are well-developed patterns, modified by\r\n  seasonal fluctuations; tropical cyclones (hurricanes) may form south\r\n  of Mexico from June to October and affect Mexico and Central\r\n  America; continental influences cause climatic uniformity to be much\r\n  less pronounced in the eastern and western regions at the same\r\n  latitude in the North Pacific Ocean; the western Pacific is\r\n  monsoonal - a rainy season occurs during the summer months, when\r\n  moisture-laden winds blow from the ocean over the land, and a dry\r\n  season during the winter months, when dry winds blow from the Asian\r\n  land mass back to the ocean; tropical cyclones (typhoons) may strike\r\n  southeast and East Asia from May to December\r\n\r\nTerrain: surface currents in the northern Pacific are dominated by\r\n  a clockwise, warm-water gyre (broad circular system of currents) and\r\n  in the southern Pacific by a counterclockwise, cool-water gyre; in\r\n  the northern Pacific, sea ice forms in the Bering Sea and Sea of\r\n  Okhotsk in winter; in the southern Pacific, sea ice from Antarctica\r\n  reaches its northernmost extent in October; the ocean floor in the\r\n  eastern Pacific is dominated by the East Pacific Rise, while the\r\n  western Pacific is dissected by deep trenches, including the\r\n  Marianas Trench, which is the world's deepest\r\n  lowest point: Marianas Trench -10,924 m\r\n  highest point: sea level 0 m\r\n\r\nNatural resources: oil and gas fields, polymetallic nodules, sand\r\n  and gravel aggregates, placer deposits, fish\r\n\r\nEnvironment:\r\n  current issues: endangered marine species include the dugong, sea\r\n  lion, sea otter, seals, turtles, and whales; oil pollution in\r\n  Philippine Sea and South China Sea\r\n  natural hazards: surrounded by a zone of violent volcanic and\r\n  earthquake activity sometimes referred to as the \"Pacific Ring of\r\n  Fire\"; subject to tropical cyclones (typhoons) in southeast and east\r\n  Asia from May to December (most frequent from July to October);\r\n  tropical cyclones (hurricanes) may form south of Mexico and strike\r\n  Central America and Mexico from June to October (most common in\r\n  August and September); southern shipping lanes subject to icebergs\r\n  from Antarctica; occasional El Nino phenomenon occurs off the coast\r\n  of Peru, when the trade winds slacken and the warm Equatorial\r\n  Countercurrent moves south, killing the plankton that is the primary\r\n  food source for anchovies; consequently, the anchovies move to\r\n  better feeding grounds, causing resident marine birds to starve by\r\n  the thousands because of the loss of their food source; ships\r\n  subject to superstructure icing in extreme north from October to May\r\n  and in extreme south from May to October; persistent fog in the\r\n  northern Pacific can be a maritime hazard from June to December\r\n  international agreements: NA\r\n\r\nGeographic note: the major choke points are the Bering Strait,\r\n  Panama Canal, Luzon Strait, and the Singapore Strait;

It provides low-cost sea transportation between East and\r\n  West, extensive fishing grounds, offshore oil and gas fields,\r\n  minerals, and sand and gravel for the construction industry. In 1985\r\n  over half (54%) of the world's fish catch came from the Pacific\r\n  Ocean, which is the only ocean where the fish catch has increased\r\n  every year since 1978. Exploitation of offshore oil and gas reserves\r\n  is playing an ever-increasing role in the energy supplies of\r\n  Australia, NZ, China, US, and Peru. The high cost of recovering\r\n  offshore oil and gas, combined with the wide swings in world prices\r\n  for oil since 1985, has slowed but not stopped new drillings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTransportation\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n\r\nPorts: Bangkok (Thailand), Hong Kong, Kao-hsiung (Taiwan), Los\r\n  Angeles (US), Manila (Philippines), Pusan (South Korea), San\r\n  Francisco (US), Seattle (US), Shanghai (China), Singapore, Sydney\r\n  (Australia), Vladivostok (Russia), Wellington (NZ), Yokohama (Japan)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommunications\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n\r\nTelephone system:\r\n  international: several submarine cables with network nodal points on\r\n  Guam and Hawaii\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n======================================================================\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n@Pakistan\r\n--------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMap\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation: 30 00 N, 70 00 E -- Southern Asia, bordering the Arabian\r\n  Sea, between India and Iran\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFlag\r\n----\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription: green with a vertical white band (symbolizing the\r\n  role of religious minorities) on the hoist side; a large white\r\n  crescent and star are centered in the green field; the crescent,\r\n  star, and color green are traditional symbols of Islam\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeography\r\n---------\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation: Southern Asia, bordering the Arabian Sea, between India\r\n  and Iran\r\n\r\nGeographic coordinates: 30 00 N, 70 00 E\r\n\r\nMap references: Asia\r\n\r\nArea:\r\n  total area: 803,940 sq km\r\n  land area: 778,720 sq km\r\n  comparative area: slightly less than twice the size of California\r\n\r\nLand boundaries:\r\n  total: 6,774 km\r\n  border countries: Afghanistan 2,430 km, China 523 km, India 2,912\r\n  km, Iran 909 km\r\n\r\nCoastline: 1,046 km\r\n\r\nMaritime claims:\r\n  contiguous zone: 24 nm\r\n  continental shelf: 200 nm or to the edge of the continental margin\r\n  exclusive economic zone: 200 nm\r\n  territorial sea: 12 nm\r\n\r\nInternational disputes: status of Kashmir with India; border\r\n  dispute with Afghanistan (Durand Line); water-sharing problems over\r\n  the Indus (Wular Barrage) with upstream riparian India\r\n\r\nClimate: mostly hot, dry desert; temperate in northwest; arctic in\r\n  north\r\n\r\nTerrain: flat Indus plain in east; mountains in north and\r\n  northwest; Balochistan plateau in west\r\n  lowest point: Indian Ocean 0 m\r\n  highest point: K2 (Mt.

Prime\r\n  Minister Benazir BHUTTO has been under pressure from the IMF and\r\n  other donors to continue the economic reforms and austerity measures\r\n  begun by her predecessor, caretaker Prime Minister Moeen QURESHI\r\n  (July-October 1993). The IMF suspended a $1.5 billion Enhanced\r\n  Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) in mid-1995 because Pakistan\r\n  slowed the pace of economic reform. Islamabad's most recent budget -\r\n  announced in June 1995 - reversed some reforms agreed to by the IMF\r\n  earlier that year, including a slowing of tariff reform. In\r\n  mid-December 1995, however, the IMF approved a $600 million standby\r\n  arrangement and urged Pakistan to move forward with economic\r\n  liberalization. Islamabad has agreed to new economic targets with\r\n  the IMF, which could lay the basis for a return to an ESAF in 1996.\r\n  Little progress was made in the privatization of large state-owned\r\n  units in 1995. The sale of the power plant Kot Addu - scheduled for\r\n  April 1995 - was stalled by opposition from labor unions. The sale\r\n  of a 26% share of United Bank Limited and the Pakistan\r\n  Telecommunications Corporation to strategic investors was due to\r\n  take place in 1995 but has been pushed back to 1996. On the plus\r\n  side real GDP grew 4.7% in 1995, up from 3.9% in 1994: GDP should\r\n  grow even faster in 1996 as a result of an above average cotton\r\n  crop. Secondly, Islamabad reduced the budget deficit to 5.6% of GDP\r\n  at the end of FY94/95, down from 8% two years earlier. Thirdly,\r\n  Pakistan attracted $1.6 billion in foreign direct and portfolio\r\n  investment in FY94/95, more than double inflows of $650 million in\r\n  the previous fiscal year; financial agreements were reached on five\r\n  power projects in 1995, including the 1,300-MW $1.8 billion Hab\r\n  River project. Despite these improvements, the economy remains\r\n  vulnerable to crisis. Foreign exchange reserves fell dramatically in\r\n  1995, reaching a low of about $1 billion in early December 1995 -\r\n  only five weeks of import cover - before rising to $1.5 billion by\r\n  yearend. The trade deficit rose to $2 billion for the first six\r\n  months of FY94/95, triple the deficit of $600 million during the\r\n  same period in FY93/94. The government responded to this situation\r\n  with a package of stabilization reforms on 28 October 1995 which\r\n  included a 7% devaluation of the rupee, supplementary duties of 10%\r\n  on many imports, and higher petroleum prices. Islamabad hopes these\r\n  moves will help make its exports more competitive. For the long run,\r\n  Pakistan must deal with serious problems of deteriorating\r\n  infrastructure, low literacy levels, and persistent law and order\r\n  problems in Karachi.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $274.2 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 4.7% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $2,100 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 24%\r\n  industry: 27%\r\n  services: 49% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 13% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 36 million\r\n  by occupation: agriculture 46%, mining and manufacturing 18%,\r\n  services 17%, other 19%\r\n  note: extensive export of labor\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $11.9 billion\r\n  expenditures: $12.4 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (FY94/95)\r\n\r\nIndustries: textiles, food processing, beverages, construction\r\n  materials, clothing, paper products, shrimp\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 5% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 12,530,000 kW (1995)\r\n  production: 43.3 billion kWh (1995)\r\n  consumption per capita: 389 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: cotton, wheat, rice, sugarcane, fruits, vegetables;\r\n  milk, beef, mutton, eggs\r\n\r\nIllicit drugs: major illicit producer of opium and hashish for the\r\n  international drug trade;

The manufacturing and agriculture sectors\r\n  have become inefficient under protectionist policies. After fast\r\n  growth during the early 1990s, the economy has slowed down in the\r\n  last two years, with GDP growth at 2.8% in 1994 and in 1995. The\r\n  slowdown has been due mostly to a reduction in construction\r\n  activities and stagnation in the Colon Free Zone and financial\r\n  services, the three fastest growing sectors early in the decade. To\r\n  counter the slowdown, the PEREZ BALLADARES administration has\r\n  launched an economic reform program designed to reverse\r\n  unemployment, attract foreign investment, cut back the size of\r\n  government, and modernize the economy. In 1995, Panama reached an\r\n  agreement in principle to reschedule its commercial debt - one of\r\n  the highest in the world in per capita terms - which will allow the\r\n  country to reenter international financial markets. Panama should\r\n  complete all requirements to join the World Trade Organization\r\n  (WTrO) in 1996.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $13.6 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 2.8% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $5,100 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 10%\r\n  industry: 16%\r\n  services: 74% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 1.1% (1995)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 979,000 (1994 est.)\r\n  by occupation: government and community services 31.8%, agriculture,\r\n  hunting, and fishing 26.8%, commerce, restaurants, and hotels 16.4%,\r\n  manufacturing and mining 9.4%, construction 3.2%, transportation and\r\n  communications 6.2%, finance, insurance, and real estate 4.3%\r\n  note: shortage of skilled labor, but an oversupply of unskilled labor\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 13.8% (1995)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $1.86 billion\r\n  expenditures: $1.86 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1995)\r\n\r\nIndustries: construction, petroleum refining, brewing, cement and\r\n  other construction materials, sugar milling\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 0.4% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 960,000 kW\r\n  production: 2.8 billion kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 1,047 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: bananas, rice, corn, coffee, sugarcane, vegetables;\r\n  livestock;

Agriculture\r\n  provides a subsistence livelihood for the bulk of the population.\r\n  Mining of numerous deposits, including copper and gold, accounts for\r\n  about 60% of export earnings. Budgetary support from Australia and\r\n  development aid under World Bank auspices have helped sustain the\r\n  economy. In 1995, Port Moresby reached agreement with the IMF and\r\n  World Bank on a structural adjustment program. PNG will receive\r\n  loans totaling $350 million over the next two years from a variety\r\n  of lenders including the Fund, the Bank, the Australian Government,\r\n  and the Japanese Export-Import Bank. The loans will be provided only\r\n  if Port Moresby implements significant reforms to liberalize trade\r\n  and investment policies, reduce the public sector, and promote\r\n  sustainable development of the forestry sector. At the start of\r\n  1996, Port Moresby is looking primarily to the exploitation of\r\n  mineral and petroleum resources to drive economic development but\r\n  new prospecting in Papua New Guinea has slumped as other\r\n  mineral-rich countries have stepped up their competition for\r\n  international investment. Output from current projects will probably\r\n  begin to taper off in 1996, but no new large ventures are being\r\n  developed to succeed them.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $10.2 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: -3% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $2,400 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: NA%\r\n  industry: NA%\r\n  services: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 15% (1995)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 1.941 million\r\n  by occupation: agriculture 64% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $1.86 billion\r\n  expenditures: $1.9 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: copra crushing, palm oil processing, plywood\r\n  production, wood chip production;

The formal economy is largely oriented toward\r\n  services, but 45% of the population derive their living from\r\n  agricultural activity, often on a subsistence basis. The economy has\r\n  grown an average of 3% to 4% over the past five years. Population\r\n  has increased at 3% a year over the same period leaving per capita\r\n  income nearly stagnant. The informal sector is marked by both\r\n  reexport of imported consumer goods (electronics, whiskeys,\r\n  perfumes, cigarettes and office equipment) to neighboring countries\r\n  as well as by the activities of thousands of microenterprises and\r\n  urban street vendors. The Paraguayan Government has stated publicly\r\n  that it will continue its economic reform agenda in close\r\n  coordination with its Mercosur (Southern Cone Common Market)\r\n  partners. In 1995, the government also promised to undertake efforts\r\n  to formalize the financial sector, after a financial shock forced\r\n  the bail-out of the second and third largest banks. Paraguay's\r\n  continued integration into Mercosur also offers potential for\r\n  growth; it is closely linked with the success of foreign investment\r\n  promotion. Non-traditional exports, such as finished agricultural\r\n  products, light manufactures, and small consumer items, are growing\r\n  rapidly. Government reform efforts, including privatization, have\r\n  continued, but with little success in 1995.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $17 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 4.2% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $3,200 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 25.7%\r\n  industry: 25.8%\r\n  services: 48.5% (1994)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 10.5% (1995)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 1.692 million (1993 est.)\r\n  by occupation: agriculture 45%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 12% (1995)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $1.25 billion (1995 est.)\r\n  expenditures: $1.66 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: meat packing, oilseed crushing, milling, brewing,\r\n  textiles, other light consumer goods, cement, construction\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 1.3% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 6,530,000 kW\r\n  production: 26.5 billion kWh (1992)\r\n  consumption per capita: NA\r\n  note: much of the electricity produced in Paraguay is exported to\r\n  Brazil and domestic consumption cannot be determined\r\n\r\nAgriculture: cotton, sugarcane, soybeans, corn, wheat, tobacco,\r\n  cassava (tapioca), fruits, vegetables;

In the\r\n  1980s, the economy suffered from hyperinflation, declining per\r\n  capita output, and mounting external debt. Peru was shut off from\r\n  IMF and World Bank support in the mid-1980s because of its huge debt\r\n  arrears. An austerity program implemented shortly after the FUJIMORI\r\n  government took office in July 1990 contributed to a third\r\n  consecutive yearly contraction of economic activity, but the slide\r\n  came to a halt late that year, and in 1991 output rose 2.4%. After a\r\n  burst of inflation as the austerity program eliminated government\r\n  price subsidies, monthly price increases eased to the single-digit\r\n  level and by December 1991 dropped to the lowest increase since\r\n  mid-1987. Lima obtained a financial rescue package from multilateral\r\n  lenders in September 1991, although it faced $14 billion in arrears\r\n  on its external debt. By working with the IMF and World Bank on new\r\n  financial conditions and arrangements, the government succeeded in\r\n  ending its arrears by March 1993. In 1992, GDP fell by 2.8%, in part\r\n  because a warmer-than-usual El Nino current resulted in a 30% drop\r\n  in the fish catch, but the economy rebounded as strong foreign\r\n  investment helped push growth to 6% in 1993, about 13% in 1994, and\r\n  6.8% in 1995.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $87 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 6.8% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $3,600 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: NA%\r\n  industry: NA%\r\n  services: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 10.2% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 8 million (1992)\r\n  by occupation: agriculture, mining and quarrying, manufacturing,\r\n  construction, transport, services\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 15%;

Although real GDP fell sharply\r\n  in 1990 and 1991, in 1992 Poland became the first country in the\r\n  region to resume economic growth with a 2.6% increase. Growth\r\n  advanced to 3.8% in 1993, 5.2% in 1994, and 6.5% in 1995. Most of\r\n  the growth since 1991 had come from the booming private sector,\r\n  which now accounts for about 60% of GDP, due in large part to the\r\n  creation of new private firms. The slow pace of privatization picked\r\n  up somewhat in 1995, as 512 smaller state enterprises were\r\n  transferred to private National Investment Funds under the Mass\r\n  Privatization Program, but large-scale industry remains largely in\r\n  state hands. Industrial production increased 10.2% in 1995,\r\n  following a 13.2% rise in 1994, yet remains about 13% below the 1989\r\n  level. Inflation, which had approached 1,200% annually in early\r\n  1990, fell to 21.6% in December 1995, as the government held the\r\n  1995 budget deficit to less than 3% of GDP. After peaking at 16.9%\r\n  in July 1994, unemployment gradually fell to 14.9% in December 1995\r\n  - although the rate still approaches 30% in some regions. The trade\r\n  and current account balances officially are in deficit but in fact\r\n  both have comfortable surpluses because of large, unrecorded sales\r\n  to cross-border visitors. Prospects for 1996 are good, with the\r\n  government promising to push privatization and social welfare\r\n  reform. Economic growth should remain above 5%, with inflation\r\n  dropping below 20% by yearend 1996 and unemployment continuing its\r\n  slow decline. As for external debt, the burden was sharply reduced\r\n  by reschedulings and write-offs of both private and official debt\r\n  during 1991-94.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $226.7 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 6.5% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $5,800 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 7%\r\n  industry: 38%\r\n  services: 55% (1993)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 21.6% (December 1995)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 17.743 million (1994 annual average)\r\n  by occupation: industry and construction 32.0%, agriculture 27.6%,\r\n  trade, transport, and communications 14.7%, government and other\r\n  25.7% (1992)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 14.9% (December 1995)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $34.5 billion\r\n  expenditures: $37.8 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: machine building, iron and steel, coal mining,\r\n  chemicals, shipbuilding, food processing, glass, beverages, textiles\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 10.2% (1995)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 31,120,000 kW\r\n  production: 133.7 billion kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 3,000 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: potatoes, milk, fruits, vegetables, wheat;

Industry has surpassed\r\n  agriculture as the primary sector of economic activity and income.\r\n  Encouraged by duty-free access to the US and by tax incentives, US\r\n  firms have invested heavily in Puerto Rico since the 1950s. US\r\n  minimum wage laws apply. Important industries include\r\n  pharmaceuticals, electronics, textiles, petrochemicals, and\r\n  processed foods. Sugar production has lost out to dairy production\r\n  and other livestock products as the main source of income in the\r\n  agricultural sector.

Sugarcane has been the primary crop for more than a\r\n  century, and in some years it accounts for 85% of exports. The\r\n  government has been pushing the development of a tourist industry to\r\n  relieve high unemployment, which recently amounted to one-third of\r\n  the labor force. The gap in Reunion between the well-off and the\r\n  poor is extraordinary and accounts for the persistent social\r\n  tensions. The white and Indian communities are substantially better\r\n  off than other segments of the population, often approaching\r\n  European standards, whereas indigenous groups suffer the poverty and\r\n  unemployment typical of the poorer nations of the African continent.\r\n  The outbreak of severe rioting in February 1991 illustrates the\r\n  seriousness of socioeconomic tensions. The economic well-being of\r\n  Reunion depends heavily on continued financial assistance from\r\n  France.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $2.9 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 2.7% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $4,300 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: NA%\r\n  industry: NA%\r\n  services: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): NA%\r\n\r\nLabor force: 242,169 (1993)\r\n  by occupation: agriculture 30%, industry 21%, services 49% (1981)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 35% (February 1991)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $NA\r\n  expenditures: $NA\r\n\r\nIndustries: sugar, rum, cigarettes, handicraft items\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 180,000 kW\r\n  production: 1 billion kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 1,454 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: sugarcane, vanilla, tobacco, tropical fruits,\r\n  vegetables, corn\r\n\r\nExports: $174 million (f.o.b., 1993)\r\n  commodities: sugar 63%, rum and molasses 4%, perfume essences 2%,\r\n  lobster 3%, (1993)\r\n  partners: France, Mauritius, Bahrain, South Africa, Italy, Madagascar\r\n\r\nImports: $2.08 billion (c.i.f., 1993)\r\n  commodities: manufactured goods, food, beverages, tobacco, machinery\r\n  and transportation equipment, raw materials, and petroleum products\r\n  partners: France, Mauritius, Bahrain, South Africa, Italy, Madagascar\r\n\r\nExternal debt: $NA\r\n\r\nEconomic aid:\r\n  recipient: substantial annual subsidies from France\r\n\r\nCurrency: 1 French franc (F) = 100 centimes\r\n\r\nExchange rates: French francs (F) per US$1 - 5.0056 (January\r\n  1996), 4.9915 (1995), 5.5520 (1994), 5.6632 (1993), 5.2938 (1992),\r\n  5.6421 (1991)\r\n\r\nFiscal year: calendar year\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTransportation\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n\r\nRailways: 0 km\r\n\r\nHighways:\r\n  total: 2,784 km\r\n  paved: 2,187 km\r\n  unpaved: 597 km (1987 est.)\r\n\r\nPorts: Le Port, Pointe des Galets\r\n\r\nMerchant marine: none\r\n\r\nAirports:\r\n  total: 2\r\n  with paved runways 2 438 to 3 047 m: 1\r\n  with paved runways 914 to 1 523 m: 1 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommunications\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n\r\nTelephones: 191,647 (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nTelephone system: adequate system;

Bucharest also was successful in\r\n  reducing its inflation rate to 25% - less than half the 1994 rate -\r\n  because of tight monetary and fiscal policies, while unemployment\r\n  fell to 9% as the private sector hired more workers. Despite these\r\n  successes on the economic front, Romania has lagged much of Central\r\n  and Eastern Europe in the restructuring process. The private sector\r\n  accounted for only 40% of GDP in 1995 with over 90% of industry\r\n  remaining in state hands. Privatization is slated to pick up in\r\n  1996, but Bucharest faces other economic problems that could stall\r\n  recovery, including a growing budget deficit, limited reform of the\r\n  agricultural and energy sectors, and accumulated decay of the\r\n  infrastructure.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $105.7 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 5.4% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $4,600 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 19.6%\r\n  industry: 36.3%\r\n  services: 44.1% (1994)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 25% (1995)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 11.3 million (1992)\r\n  by occupation: industry 38%, agriculture 28%, other 34% (1989)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 8.9% (December 1995)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $5.35 billion\r\n  expenditures: $6.6 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: mining, timber, construction materials, metallurgy,\r\n  chemicals, machine building, food processing, petroleum production\r\n  and refining\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 3.3% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 22,180,000 kW\r\n  production: 50.8 billion kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 2,076 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: wheat, corn, sugar beets, sunflower seed, potatoes,\r\n  grapes;

The\r\n  break-up of the USSR into 15 successor states in late 1991 destroyed\r\n  major economic links that have been only partially replaced. As a\r\n  result of these dislocations and the failure of the government to\r\n  implement a rigorous and consistent reform program, output in Russia\r\n  has dropped by one-third since 1990 (instead of the one-half\r\n  previously estimated). On the one hand, President YEL'TSIN's\r\n  government has made substantial strides in converting to a market\r\n  economy since launching its economic reform program in January 1992\r\n  by freeing nearly all prices, slashing defense spending, eliminating\r\n  the old centralized distribution system, completing an ambitious\r\n  voucher privatization program in 1994, establishing private\r\n  financial institutions, and decentralizing foreign trade. On the\r\n  other hand, Russia has made little progress in a number of key areas\r\n  that are needed to provide a solid foundation for the transition to\r\n  a market economy; and the strong showing of the communists and\r\n  nationalists in the Duma elections in December 1995 casts a shadow\r\n  over prospects for further reforms. In 1995, the new cash\r\n  privatization program went slower than planned. The state claims\r\n  that the nonstate sector produced approximately 70% of GDP in 1995,\r\n  up from 62% in 1994, although these figures apparently include many\r\n  enterprises that have only nominally moved out of state control.\r\n  Moscow has been slow to develop the legal framework necessary to\r\n  fully support a market economy and to encourage foreign investment.\r\n  Stockholder rights remain ill-defined and the Duma has yet to adopt\r\n  a land code that would allow development of land markets as sources\r\n  of needed capital. Russia's securities market remains largely\r\n  unregulated and suffers from the lack of a comprehensive securities\r\n  law. In addition, Moscow has yet to develop a social safety net that\r\n  would allow faster restructuring by relieving enterprises of the\r\n  burden of providing social benefits for their workers. Most\r\n  rank-and-file Russians perceive they are worse off because of\r\n  growing crime and health problems, the drop in real wages, the great\r\n  rise in wage arrears, and the widespread threat of unemployment. The\r\n  number of Russians living below the official poverty level rose by\r\n  10% to 36.6 million people, or 25% of the population. The decline in\r\n  output slowed during 1995, and some sectors showed signs of a\r\n  turnaround; analysts forecast the resumption of growth in 1996 - at\r\n  a low rate. Russian official data, which fail to capture a\r\n  considerable portion of private sector output and employment, show\r\n  that GDP declined by 4% in 1995, as compared with a 15% decline in\r\n  1994. Despite continued declines in agricultural and industrial\r\n  production, unemployment climbed only slowly to about 8% of the work\r\n  force by yearend because government policies aimed at softening the\r\n  impact of reforms have created incentives for enterprises to keep\r\n  workers on the rolls even as production slowed to a crawl. Moscow\r\n  renewed tightened financial policies in early 1995 and succeeded in\r\n  reducing monthly consumer price inflation from 18% in January to\r\n  about 3% in December, the lowest monthly rate since the beginning of\r\n  reform. According to official trade statistics, Russia ran a $19.9\r\n  billion trade surplus for 1995, up from $15.9 billion in 1994. It\r\n  continued to shift its trade away from the other former Soviet\r\n  republics toward the West, with the CIS countries' share of Russian\r\n  trade falling to 22% in 1995. Russia made good progress with\r\n  official and commercial creditors in 1995 in resolving the issue of\r\n  its $105 billion in Soviet-era debts. When completed, these Paris\r\n  Club and London Club rescheduling agreements will reduce Russia's\r\n  repayment liabilities from $20 billion to less than $5 billion\r\n  annually through the end of the decade. Capital flight reportedly\r\n  continued to be a problem in 1995, with billions of additional\r\n  dollars in assets being moved abroad, primarily to bank accounts in\r\n  Europe.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $796 billion (1995 estimate as\r\n  extrapolated from World Bank estimate for 1994)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: -4% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $5,300 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 6%\r\n  industry: 41%\r\n  services: 53%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 7% monthly average (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 85 million (1993)\r\n  by occupation: production and economic services 83.9%, government\r\n  16.1%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 8.2% (December 1995) with considerable\r\n  additional underemployment\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $NA\r\n  expenditures: $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n\r\nIndustries: complete range of mining and extractive industries\r\n  producing coal, oil, gas, chemicals, and metals;

The agricultural sector\r\n  dominates the economy; coffee and tea normally make up 80%-90% of\r\n  total exports. The amount of fertile land is limited, however, and\r\n  deforestation and soil erosion continue to create problems.\r\n  Manufacturing focuses mainly on the processing of agricultural\r\n  products. Weak international prices since 1986 have caused the\r\n  economy to contract and per capita GDP to decline. A structural\r\n  adjustment program with the World Bank began in October 1990.\r\n  Ethnic-based insurgency since 1990 has devastated wide areas,\r\n  especially in the north, and displaced hundreds of thousands of\r\n  people. A peace accord in mid-1993 temporarily ended most of the\r\n  fighting, but resumption of large-scale civil warfare in April 1994\r\n  in the capital city Kigali and elsewhere has been taking thousands\r\n  of lives and severely affecting short-term economic prospects. The\r\n  economy suffers massively from failure to maintain the\r\n  infrastructure, looting, neglect of important cash crops, and lack\r\n  of health care facilities. GDP in 1994 may have dropped by as much\r\n  as half. The further decline of GDP in 1995 was much smaller and was\r\n  more than offset by aid from the outside. Because of the severe\r\n  damage to real property and the decline in public discipline,\r\n  recovery of domestic production toward previous levels is proceeding\r\n  slowly.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $3.8 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: -2.7% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $400 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 52%\r\n  industry: 13%\r\n  services: 35% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 64% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 3.6 million\r\n  by occupation: agriculture 93%, government and services 5%, industry\r\n  and commerce 2%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $NA\r\n  expenditures: $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: mining of cassiterite (tin ore) and wolframite\r\n  (tungsten ore), tin, cement, agricultural processing, small-scale\r\n  beverage production, soap, furniture, shoes, plastic goods,\r\n  textiles, cigarettes\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: -50% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 60,000 kW\r\n  production: 190 million kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 23 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: coffee, tea, pyrethrum (insecticide made from\r\n  chrysanthemums), bananas, beans, sorghum, potatoes;

Indeed, the destructive effect of\r\n  Tropical Storm Iris in mid-1995 caused the loss of 20% of the year's\r\n  banana crop.

As a result, a shortage of cocoa for\r\n  export has created a serious balance-of-payments problem. Production\r\n  of less important crops, such as coffee, copra, and palm kernels,\r\n  has also declined. The value of imports generally exceeds that of\r\n  exports by a ratio of 3 to 1 or more. The emphasis on cocoa\r\n  production at the expense of other food crops has meant that Sao\r\n  Tome has to import 90% of food needs. It also has to import all\r\n  fuels and most manufactured goods. Over the years, Sao Tome has been\r\n  unable to service its external debt and has had to depend on\r\n  concessional aid and debt rescheduling. Considerable potential\r\n  exists for development of a tourist industry, and the government has\r\n  taken steps to expand facilities in recent years. The government\r\n  also has attempted to reduce price controls and subsidies and to\r\n  encourage market-based mechanisms, e.g., to facilitate the\r\n  distribution of imported food. Annual GDP growth has hovered around\r\n  1.5% since 1991.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $138 million (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 1.5% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $1,000 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 28%\r\n  industry: 14%\r\n  services: 58% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 38% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: most of population mainly engaged in subsistence\r\n  agriculture and fishing;

About 40%\r\n  of GDP comes from the private sector. Economic (as well as\r\n  political) ties with the US are especially strong. The petroleum\r\n  sector accounts for roughly 75% of budget revenues, 35% of GDP, and\r\n  90% of export earnings. Saudi Arabia has the largest reserves of\r\n  petroleum in the world (26% of the proved total), ranks as the\r\n  largest exporter of petroleum, and plays a leading role in OPEC. For\r\n  the 1990s the government intends to bring its budget, which has been\r\n  in deficit since 1983, back into balance, and to encourage private\r\n  economic activity. Roughly four million foreign workers play an\r\n  important role in the Saudi economy, for example, in the oil and\r\n  banking sectors. For over a decade, Saudi Arabia's domestic and\r\n  international outlays have outstripped its income, and the\r\n  government has cut its foreign assistance and is beginning to rein\r\n  in domestic programs. For 1996, the country looks to its policies of\r\n  maintaining moderate fiscal reforms, restraining public spending,\r\n  and encouraging non-oil exports.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $189.3 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 0% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $10,100 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 9%\r\n  industry: 50%\r\n  services: 41% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 5% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 6 million-7 million\r\n  by occupation: government 40%, industry, construction, and oil 25%,\r\n  services 30%, agriculture 5%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 6.5% (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $35.1 billion\r\n  expenditures: $40 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: crude oil production, petroleum refining, basic\r\n  petrochemicals, cement, two small steel-rolling mills, construction,\r\n  fertilizer, plastics\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 17% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 17,550,000 kW\r\n  production: 46 billion kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 2,430 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: wheat, barley, tomatoes, melons, dates, citrus;\r\n  mutton, chickens, eggs, milk\r\n\r\nIllicit drugs: death penalty for traffickers;

After years of foot-dragging, the government has\r\n  passed a liberalized labor code which should lower the cost of labor\r\n  and improve the manufacturing sector's competitiveness. Inroads also\r\n  have been made in closing tax loopholes, eliminating monopoly power\r\n  in several sectors, and privatizing state owned firms. At the same\r\n  time, the government is holding the line on current fiscal\r\n  expenditure under the watchful eyes of international organizations\r\n  on which it depends for substantial support. The IMF, in mid-1995,\r\n  announced that the government met most economic targets as called\r\n  for in its Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility agreement and\r\n  released the second $50 million tranche. The country's narrow\r\n  resource base, environmental degradation, and untamed population\r\n  growth will continue to hold back improvement in living standards\r\n  over the medium term.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $14.5 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 4.5% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $1,600 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: NA%\r\n  industry: NA%\r\n  services: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 6.1% (1995)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 2.509 million (77% are engaged in subsistence\r\n  farming;

Serbia and Montenegro faces major\r\n  economic problems; output has dropped sharply, particularly in 1993.\r\n  Like the other former Yugoslav republics, it depended on its sister\r\n  republics for large amounts of energy supplies and manufactures.\r\n  Wide differences in climate, mineral resources, and levels of\r\n  technology among the republics accentuated this interdependence, as\r\n  did the communist practice of concentrating much industrial output\r\n  in a small number of giant plants. The breakup of many of the trade\r\n  links, the sharp drop in output as industrial plants lost suppliers\r\n  and markets, and the destruction of physical assets in the fighting\r\n  all have contributed to the economic difficulties of the republics.\r\n  One singular factor in the economic situation of Serbia and\r\n  Montenegro is the continuation in office of a communist government\r\n  that is primarily interested in political and military mastery, not\r\n  economic reform. Hyperinflation ended with the establishment of a\r\n  new currency unit in June 1993; prices were relatively stable in\r\n  1994. Reliable statistics are hard to come by; the GDP estimate of\r\n  $2,000 per capita is extremely rough.

In recent\r\n  years the government has encouraged foreign investment in order to\r\n  upgrade hotels and other services. At the same time, the government\r\n  has moved to reduce the high dependence on tourism by promoting the\r\n  development of farming, fishing, and small-scale manufacturing. The\r\n  vulnerability of the tourist sector was illustrated by the sharp\r\n  drop in 1991-92 due largely to the Gulf war. Although the industry\r\n  has rebounded, the government recognizes the continuing need for\r\n  upgrading the sector in the face of stiff international competition.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $430 million (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: -2% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $6,000 (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: NA%\r\n  industry: NA%\r\n  services: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 3.9% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 27,700 (1985)\r\n  by occupation: industry and commerce 31%, services 21%, government\r\n  20%, agriculture, forestry, and fishing 12%, other 16% (1985)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 9% (1987)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $227.4 million\r\n  expenditures: $263 million, including capital expenditures of $54\r\n  million (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: tourism, processing of coconut and vanilla, fishing,\r\n  coir (coconut fiber) rope factory, boat building, printing,\r\n  furniture, beverage\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 4% (1992)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 30,000 kW\r\n  production: 110 million kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 1,399 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: coconuts, cinnamon, vanilla, sweet potatoes, cassava\r\n  (tapioca), bananas;

However, the economic and\r\n  social infrastructure is not well developed, and serious social\r\n  disorders continue to push down production, exports, and the value\r\n  of the leone. Agriculture employs about two-thirds of the working\r\n  population, with subsistence agriculture dominating the sector.\r\n  Manufacturing consists mainly of the processing of raw materials and\r\n  of light manufacturing for the domestic market. The mining of\r\n  diamonds, bauxite, and rutile is the major source of hard currency.\r\n  The government has worked hard to meet its IMF- and World\r\n  Bank-mandated stabilization targets, holding down fiscal deficits,\r\n  and retiring much of its domestic debt - but at a steep cost in\r\n  terms of forgone capital investments and social spending. Moreover,\r\n  the economic infrastructure has nearly collapsed due to neglect and\r\n  war-related disruptions in the mining and agricultural export\r\n  sectors. The continuing civil war in Liberia has led to a large\r\n  influx of refugees, who place additional burdens on Sierra Leone's\r\n  fragile economy.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $4.4 billion (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: -4% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $960 (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 40%\r\n  industry: 17%\r\n  services: 43% (1994)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 24% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 1.369 million (1981 est.)\r\n  by occupation: agriculture 65%, industry 19%, services 16% (1981\r\n  est.)\r\n  note: only about 65,000 wage earners (1985)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $75 million\r\n  expenditures: $128 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (FY94/95 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: mining (diamonds, bauxite, rutile);

Macroeconomic performance improved steadily in 1994 and\r\n  1995 - with 4.8% and 6% growth, respectively. But privatization\r\n  progressed only in fits and starts. Strong export performance\r\n  boosted growth in both years, with consumption and investment\r\n  rebounding. Unemployment fell to 12.8% in November 1995, the lowest\r\n  level since mid-1993, and inflation dropped from 26% in 1993 to 7.5%\r\n  in 1995. The federal government deficit fell from 7% of GDP in 1993\r\n  to less than 2% in 1994-95, as growth boosted revenues. Positive\r\n  international financial performance led Standard & Poor's to raise\r\n  its rating of the National Bank of Slovakia's foreign currency debt\r\n  to just one step below investment grade. The trade and current\r\n  accounts are both in surplus, and foreign currency reserves held by\r\n  the central bank have climbed to $3.5 billion. Foreign debt of $4.6\r\n  billion - about the same as Romania's - is the lowest in Central and\r\n  Eastern Europe and the second lowest per capita. Bratislava made the\r\n  Slovak crown convertible for current account transactions on 1\r\n  October 1995. Slovakia continued to have difficulty attracting\r\n  foreign investment, however, because of perceived political\r\n  uncertainty and vacillations in privatization policy. The government\r\n  as well as the OECD projects 5% growth in 1996 and 1997.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $39 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 6% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $7,200 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 6.7%\r\n  industry: 47.6%\r\n  services: 45.7% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 7.5% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 2.484 million\r\n  by occupation: industry 33.2%, agriculture 12.2%, construction\r\n  10.3%, communication and other 44.3% (1990)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 13% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $6.1 billion\r\n  expenditures: $6.4 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: metal and metal products;

Its per capita GDP is now the highest in\r\n  Central and Eastern Europe and not far below the levels in the\r\n  poorer West European countries. Slovenia has benefited from strong\r\n  ties to Western Europe and suffered comparatively small physical\r\n  damage during Yugoslavia's breakup. The beginning was difficult,\r\n  however. Real GDP fell 15% in 1991-92, while inflation soared to\r\n  200% in 1992 and unemployment reached 9%. The turning point came in\r\n  1993, when real GDP grew 1%, unemployment leveled off, and inflation\r\n  slowed dramatically. In 1994, real GDP rose 5.5%, tapering off to an\r\n  estimated 4.8% in 1995, while inflation and unemployment both were\r\n  down to about 8% by late 1995. The government gets good marks from\r\n  foreign observers for fiscal policy - the budget deficit has not\r\n  exceeded 1% of GDP in any year since 1991, and the current account\r\n  balance has remained in surplus throughout the transition period,\r\n  with the exception of 1995. The Slovene privatization program, which\r\n  began in 1994, involves about 1,400 firms, but only 412 have been\r\n  privatized. The rest are expected to reach private hands by\r\n  end-1996, but that does not include firms in so-called strategic\r\n  industries, such as telecommunications and energy. Foreign\r\n  investment jumped to an estimated $150 million in 1995 from $83.7\r\n  million in 1994. With inflation and unemployment expected to\r\n  continue edging down, the outlook for 1996 is generally good. A\r\n  slowdown in Western Europe - which buys 70% of Slovenia's exports -\r\n  could hurt exports, however, lowering GDP growth to about 4% and\r\n  perhaps pushing the current account into a small deficit.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $22.6 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 4.8% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $11,000 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 5.3%\r\n  industry: 39.9%\r\n  services: 54.8% (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 8% (December 1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 786,036\r\n  by occupation: agriculture 2%, manufacturing and mining 46%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 8% (December 1995 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $6.6 billion\r\n  expenditures: $6.6 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1993)\r\n\r\nIndustries: ferrous metallurgy and rolling mill products, aluminum\r\n  reduction and rolled products, lead and zinc smelting, electronics\r\n  (including military electronics), trucks, electric power equipment,\r\n  wood products, textiles, chemicals, machine tools\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 2% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 2,700,000 kW\r\n  production: 8.9 billion kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 4,470 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: potatoes, hops, wheat, sugar beets, corn, grapes;\r\n  cattle, sheep, poultry\r\n\r\nIllicit drugs: transit point for Southwest Asian heroin bound for\r\n  Western Europe\r\n\r\nExports: $8.3 billion (f.o.b., 1995 est.)\r\n  commodities: machinery and transport equipment 27%, intermediate\r\n  manufactured goods 26%, chemicals 9%, food 4.8%, raw materials 3%,\r\n  consumer goods 26% (1993)\r\n  partners: Germany 30.9%, former Yugoslavia 14.0%, Italy 14.1%,\r\n  France 8.9%, Austria 6.4%, CEFTA (Central European Free Trade\r\n  Agreement) countries 5% (January-August 1995 est.)\r\n\r\nImports: $9.1 billion (f.o.b., 1995 est.)\r\n  commodities: machinery and transport equipment 30%, intermediate\r\n  manufactured goods 17.6%, chemicals 11.5%, raw materials 5.3%, fuels\r\n  and lubricants 10.8%, food 8.4% (1993)\r\n  partners: Germany 23.3%, Italy 16.8%, former Yugoslavia 7.0%, France\r\n  8.5%, Austria 9.7% (January-August 1995 est.)\r\n\r\nExternal debt: $2.9 billion (1995)\r\n\r\nEconomic aid:\r\n  recipient: ODA, $5 million (1993)\r\n\r\nCurrency: 1 tolar (SlT) = 100 stotins\r\n\r\nExchange rates: tolars (SlT) per US$1 - 121.27 (November 1995),\r\n  118.9 (1995), 128.81 (1994), 113.24 (1993), 81.29 (1992), 27.57\r\n  (1991)\r\n\r\nFiscal year: calendar year\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTransportation\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n\r\nRailways:\r\n  total: 1,201 km\r\n  standard gauge: 1,201 km 1.435-m gauge (electrified 499 km) (1994)\r\n\r\nHighways:\r\n  total: 14,794 km\r\n  paved: 13,314 km (including 187 km of expressways)\r\n  unpaved: 1,480 km (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nWaterways: NA\r\n\r\nPipelines: crude oil 290 km;

Most manufactured goods and petroleum products\r\n  must be imported. The islands are rich in undeveloped mineral\r\n  resources such as lead, zinc, nickel, and gold. The government of\r\n  the Solomon Islands is nearing financial insolvency. In mid-1995 the\r\n  central bank suspended interest and principal payments on government\r\n  bonds and treasury bills held by financial institutions and the\r\n  general public. The government has taken no steps to restrain\r\n  expenditure or address the deficit, which is expected to be\r\n  considerably higher than the $20 million forecasted in the 1996\r\n  budget.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $1 billion (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 8% (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $2,590 (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: NA%\r\n  industry: NA%\r\n  services: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 13% (1994)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 26,842\r\n  by occupation: services 41.5%, agriculture, forestry, and fishing\r\n  23.7%, commerce, transport, and finance 21.7%, construction,\r\n  manufacturing, and mining 13.1% (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $81.3 million\r\n  expenditures: $101.9 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: copra, fish (tuna)\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: -3.8% (1991 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 21,000 kW\r\n  production: 30 million kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 80 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: cocoa, beans, coconuts, palm kernels, rice, potatoes,\r\n  vegetables, fruit;

Moreover, much of the economy\r\n  has been devastated by the civil war. Agriculture is the most\r\n  important sector, with livestock accounting for about 40% of GDP and\r\n  about 65% of export earnings. Nomads and seminomads, who are\r\n  dependent upon livestock for their livelihood, make up a large\r\n  portion of the population. Crop production generates only 10% of GDP\r\n  and employs about 20% of the work force. The main export crop is\r\n  bananas; sugar, sorghum, and corn are grown for the domestic market.\r\n  The small industrial sector is based on the processing of\r\n  agricultural products and accounts for less than 10% of GDP; most\r\n  facilities have been shut down because of the civil strife. The\r\n  greatly increased political turmoil of 1991-93 resulted in a\r\n  substantial drop in agricultural output, with widespread famine. In\r\n  1994 economic conditions stabilized in the countryside, followed in\r\n  1995 by slight improvements. However, ongoing civil strife in\r\n  Mogadishu and outlying areas is interfering with any substantial\r\n  recovery.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $3.6 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 2% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $500 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: NA%\r\n  industry: NA%\r\n  services: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): NA\r\n\r\nLabor force: 3.7 million (very few are skilled laborers)(1993 est.)\r\n  by occupation: agriculture (mostly pastoral nomadism) 71%, industry\r\n  and services 29%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $NA\r\n  expenditures: $NA, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n\r\nIndustries: a few small industries, including sugar refining,\r\n  textiles, petroleum refining (mostly shut down)\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 75,000 kW prior to the civil war, but now largely shut\r\n  down due to war damage; some localities operate their own generating\r\n  plants, providing limited municipal power; note - UN and relief\r\n  organizations use their own portable power systems\r\n  production: NA kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: NA kWh\r\n\r\nAgriculture: bananas, sorghum, corn, mangoes, sugarcane; cattle,\r\n  sheep, goats; fishing potential largely unexploited\r\n\r\nExports: $100 million (1995 est.)\r\n  commodities: bananas, live animals, fish, hides\r\n  partners: Saudi Arabia, other Gulf states, Italy, US (bananas)\r\n\r\nImports: $249 million (1990 est.)\r\n  commodities: petroleum products, foodstuffs, construction materials\r\n  partners: US 13%, Italy, FRG, Kenya, UK, Saudi Arabia (1986)\r\n\r\nExternal debt: $1.9 billion (1989)\r\n\r\nEconomic aid:\r\n  recipient: ODA, $NA\r\n\r\nCurrency: 1 Somali shilling (So.

In contrast,\r\n  most of the remaining population suffers from the poverty patterns\r\n  of the Third World, including unemployment and lack of job skills.\r\n  The main strength of the economy lies in its rich mineral resources,\r\n  which provide two-thirds of exports. Economic developments for the\r\n  remainder of the 1990s will be driven largely by the new\r\n  government's attempts to improve black living conditions, to set the\r\n  country on a steady export-led growth path, and to cut back the\r\n  enormous numbers of unemployed. The economy in recent years has\r\n  absorbed less than 5% of the more than 300,000 workers entering the\r\n  labor force annually. Local economists estimate that the economy\r\n  must grow between 5% and 6% in real terms annually to absorb all of\r\n  the new entrants, much less reduce the accumulated total.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $215 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 3.3% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $4,800 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: NA%\r\n  industry: NA%\r\n  services: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 8.7% (1995)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 14.2 million economically active (1996)\r\n  by occupation: services 35%, agriculture 30%, industry 20%, mining\r\n  9%, other 6%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 32.6% (1996 est.);

Spain's official\r\n  unemployment rate of 23% is the highest in the EU, and the troubled\r\n  Socialists had been reluctant to cut social spending. Parliament\r\n  rejected the administration's proposed 1996 budget because of\r\n  political wrangling - not because of great differences with the\r\n  substance of the spending plan - forcing the government to continue\r\n  spending at 1995 levels and use piecemeal decrees to raise\r\n  consumption taxes to a level consistent with inflation. The\r\n  conservative opposition Popular Party, now in power after ending 13\r\n  years of Socialist rule in the spring of 1996, has promised to cut\r\n  government spending, loosen regulations on financial markets, and\r\n  lower taxes to spur job creation. The conservatives have stated\r\n  support for Spain's role in the EU but also have cautioned against\r\n  harming Spain's economy by moving too quickly to meet the criteria\r\n  for monetary union.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $565 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 3% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $14,300 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 3.6%\r\n  industry: 33.6%\r\n  services: 62.8% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 4.3% (1995)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 11.837 million\r\n  by occupation: services 59%, industry 21%, agriculture 11%,\r\n  construction 9% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 22.8% (yearend 1995)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $96.8 billion\r\n  expenditures: $122.5 billion, including capital expenditures of $5.7\r\n  billion (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: textiles and apparel (including footwear), food and\r\n  beverages, metals and metal manufactures, chemicals, shipbuilding,\r\n  automobiles, machine tools, tourism\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 7% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 43,800,000 kW\r\n  production: 148 billion kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 3,545 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: grain, vegetables, olives, wine grapes, sugar beets,\r\n  citrus;

The economy has been plagued by high rates of\r\n  unemployment since the late 1970s. Economic growth accelerated in\r\n  1991-94 as domestic conditions began to improve and conditions for\r\n  foreign investment brightened. In 1995, however, the government's\r\n  emphasis on populist measures and its preoccupation with the\r\n  stepped-up Tamil insurgency have clouded Sri Lanka's economic\r\n  prospects and discouraged foreign investors. A further problem for\r\n  1996 is the need to curb government overspending.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $65.6 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 5% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $3,600 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 24%\r\n  industry: 24%\r\n  services: 52% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 8.4% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 6.1 million\r\n  by occupation: agriculture 45%, services 37%, industry 18% (1993\r\n  est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 13% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $2.7 billion\r\n  expenditures: $3.7 billion, including capital expenditures of $851\r\n  million (1995)\r\n\r\nIndustries: processing of rubber, tea, coconuts, and other\r\n  agricultural commodities;

Industry mainly processes\r\n  agricultural items. Sluggish economic performance over the past\r\n  decade, attributable largely to declining annual rainfall, has\r\n  reduced levels of per capita income and consumption. A large foreign\r\n  debt and huge arrearages continue to cause difficulties. In 1990 the\r\n  International Monetary Fund took the unusual step of declaring Sudan\r\n  noncooperative because of its nonpayment of arrearages to the Fund.\r\n  After Sudan backtracked on promised reforms in 1992-93, the IMF\r\n  threatened to expel Sudan from the Fund. To avoid expulsion,\r\n  Khartoum agreed to make payments on its arrears to the Fund,\r\n  liberalize exchange rates, and reduce subsidies, measures it has\r\n  partially implemented. The government's continued prosecution of the\r\n  civil war and its growing international isolation continued to\r\n  inhibit growth in the nonagricultural sectors of the economy during\r\n  1995. Agricultural production in 1995, while fairly good, was not up\r\n  to the bumper crop level of 1994.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $25 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 0% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $800 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 33%\r\n  industry: 17%\r\n  services: 50% (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 66% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 8.9 million (1993 est.)\r\n  by occupation: agriculture 80%, industry and commerce 10%,\r\n  government 6%\r\n  note: labor shortages for almost all categories of skilled\r\n  employment (1983 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 30% (FY92/93 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $382 million\r\n  expenditures: $1.06 billion, including capital expenditures of $91\r\n  million (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: cotton ginning, textiles, cement, edible oils, sugar,\r\n  soap distilling, shoes, petroleum refining\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 6.8% (FY92/93 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 500,000 kW\r\n  production: 1.3 billion kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 42 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: cotton, oilseed, sorghum, millet, wheat, gum arabic;\r\n  sheep\r\n\r\nExports: $535 million (f.o.b., 1995 est.)\r\n  commodities: cotton 24%, livestock/meat 13%, gum arabic 11%\r\n  partners: EU 39%, Saudi Arabia 19%, Japan 9%, US 3% (1993)\r\n\r\nImports: $1.1 billion (c.i.f., 1995 est.)\r\n  commodities: foodstuffs, petroleum products, manufactured goods,\r\n  machinery and equipment, medicines and chemicals, textiles\r\n  partners: EU 31%, Libya 19%, Egypt 5%, Saudi Arabia 5%, US 5% (1993)\r\n\r\nExternal debt: $18 billion (yearend 1995 est.)\r\n\r\nEconomic aid:\r\n  recipient: ODA, $387 million (1993)\r\n\r\nCurrency: 1 Sudanese pound (LSd) = 100 piastres\r\n\r\nExchange rates: Sudanese pounds (LSd) per US$1 - official rate:\r\n  750.0 (November 1995), 277.8 (1994), 153.8 (1993), 69.4 (1992),\r\n  5.4288 (1991);

Following a dismal year in 1994 which saw the\r\n  value of the Surinamese currency plummet by about 80%, inflation\r\n  rise to more than 600%, and national output fall for the fifth\r\n  consecutive year, nearly all economic indicators improved in 1995.\r\n  The VENETIAAN government unified the exchange rate and the currency\r\n  gained some of its lost value. In addition, inflation fell to double\r\n  digits and tax revenues increased sufficiently to nearly erase the\r\n  budget deficit.

By treaty (9 February 1920), the nationals of the treaty\r\n  powers have equal rights to exploit mineral deposits, subject to\r\n  Norwegian regulation. Although US, UK, Dutch, and Swedish coal\r\n  companies have mined in the past, the only companies still mining\r\n  are Norwegian and Russian. The settlements on Svalbard are\r\n  essentially company towns. The Norwegian state-owned coal company\r\n  employs nearly 60% of the Norwegian population on the island, runs\r\n  many of the local services, and provides most of the local\r\n  infrastructure. There is also some trapping of seal, polar bear,\r\n  fox, and walrus.\r\n\r\nLabor force: NA\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $11.6 million\r\n  expenditures: $11.6 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 21,000 kW\r\n  production: 45 million kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 13,860 kWh (1992)\r\n\r\nCurrency: 1 Norwegian krone (NKr) = 100 oere\r\n\r\nExchange rates: Norwegian kroner (NKr) per US$1 - 6.4160 (January\r\n  1996), 6.3352 (1995), 7.0576 (1994), 7.0941 (1993), 6.2145 (1992),\r\n  6.4829 (1991)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTransportation\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n\r\nRailways: 0 km\r\n\r\nHighways:\r\n  total: NA km\r\n  paved: NA km\r\n  unpaved: NA km\r\n\r\nPorts: Barentsburg, Longyearbyen, Ny-Alesund, Pyramiden\r\n\r\nMerchant marine: none\r\n\r\nAirports:\r\n  total: 4\r\n  with paved runways 1 524 to 2 437 m: 1\r\n  with paved runways under 914 m: 3 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommunications\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n\r\nTelephones: NA\r\n\r\nTelephone system:\r\n  domestic: local telephone service\r\n  international: satellite earth station - 1 of NA type (for\r\n  communication with Norwegian mainland only)\r\n\r\nRadio broadcast stations: AM 1, FM 1 (repeaters 2), shortwave 0\r\n  note: there are five meteorological/radio stations\r\n\r\nRadios: NA\r\n\r\nTelevision broadcast stations: 1\r\n\r\nTelevisions: NA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDefense\r\n-------\r\n\r\n\r\nDefense note: demilitarized by treaty (9 February 1920)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n======================================================================\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n@Swaziland\r\n---------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMap\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation: 26 30 S, 31 30 E -- Southern Africa, between Mozambique\r\n  and South Africa\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFlag\r\n----\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription: three horizontal bands of blue (top), red (triple\r\n  width), and blue;

Manufacturing features a number of agroprocessing\r\n  factories. Mining has declined in importance in recent years;\r\n  high-grade iron ore deposits were depleted by 1978, and health\r\n  concerns cut world demand for asbestos. Exports of sugar and\r\n  forestry products are the main earners of hard currency. Surrounded\r\n  by South Africa, except for a short border with Mozambique,\r\n  Swaziland is heavily dependent on South Africa, from which it\r\n  receives 90% of its imports and to which it sends about half of its\r\n  exports.

It has a modern distribution system, excellent\r\n  internal and external communications, and a skilled labor force.\r\n  Timber, hydropower, and iron ore constitute the resource base of an\r\n  economy heavily oriented toward foreign trade. Privately-owned firms\r\n  account for about 90% of industrial output, of which the engineering\r\n  sector accounts for 50% of output and exports. In 1993, agriculture\r\n  accounted for only 2% of GDP and 2% of the jobs. In recent years,\r\n  however, this extraordinarily favorable picture has been clouded by\r\n  budgetary difficulties, inflation, growing unemployment, and a\r\n  gradual loss of competitiveness in international markets. In\r\n  November 1992, Sweden broke its tie to the EC's ECU (European\r\n  Currency Unit), and depreciation of the krona has boosted export\r\n  competitiveness and helped lift Sweden out of its 1991-93 recession.\r\n  To curb the budget deficit and bolster confidence in the economy,\r\n  the government adopted an adjustment program in November 1994 that\r\n  aims to eliminate the government budget deficit and to stabilize the\r\n  debt to GDP ratio. Sweden has harmonized its economic policies with\r\n  those of the EU, which it joined at the start of 1995.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $177.3 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 3.5% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $20,100 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 2%\r\n  industry: 27%\r\n  services: 71% (1993)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 2.6% (1995)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 4.552 million (84% unionized, 1992)\r\n  by occupation: community, social and personal services 38.3%, mining\r\n  and manufacturing 21.2%, commerce, hotels, and restaurants 14.1%,\r\n  banking, insurance 9.0%, communications 7.2%, construction 7.0%,\r\n  agriculture, fishing, and forestry 3.2% (1991)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 7.8% (December 1995) plus about 6% in training\r\n  programs\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $109.4 billion\r\n  expenditures: $146.1 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (FY95/96)\r\n\r\nIndustries: iron and steel, precision equipment (bearings, radio\r\n  and telephone parts, armaments), wood pulp and paper products,\r\n  processed foods, motor vehicles\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 11.7% (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 34,560,000 kW\r\n  production: 141 billion kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 14,891 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: grains, sugar beets, potatoes;

After recovering slowly in 1994-95 from recession, the\r\n  Swiss economy remains weak, mainly because of the strong Swiss franc\r\n  and weak growth in Swiss export market, especially in other European\r\n  countries. Over the near term, growth may average barely 1%, with\r\n  more than one-half of this increase resulting from growth in\r\n  inventories. Weak domestic consumer demand is the principal culprit;\r\n  stagnation in real disposable income is combining with a reluctance\r\n  to reduce saving rates in the face of an uncertain employment\r\n  outlook. Switzerland's leading sectors, including financial\r\n  services, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, and special-purpose\r\n  machines, will therefore be more reliant on export markets at the\r\n  same time they are being squeezed by the strong franc. Consequently,\r\n  growth in machinery and equipment investment, for example, is\r\n  expected to taper off. On the other side, import growth has been\r\n  fueled by the strong franc; there are growing indications that Swiss\r\n  manufacturers are substituting imported inputs for domestic ones.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $158.5 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 1.2% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $22,400 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 3%\r\n  industry: 33.5%\r\n  services: 63.5% (1991)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 1.8% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 3.48 million (900,000 foreign workers, mostly Italian)\r\n  by occupation: services 50%, industry and crafts 34%, government\r\n  10%, agriculture and forestry 6% (1992)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 3.3% (1995)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $31 billion\r\n  expenditures: $36.9 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1995)\r\n\r\nIndustries: machinery, chemicals, watches, textiles, precision\r\n  instruments\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 15,430,000 kW\r\n  production: 58 billion kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 6,699 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: grains, fruits, vegetables;

Economic growth averaged roughly 10%. The war\r\n  led to a Syrian aid windfall of nearly $5 billion from Arab,\r\n  European, and Japanese donors. Most positive economic trends ended\r\n  in 1993 due to the dissipation of the Gulf war boom, a domestic\r\n  financial crisis, and economic policy missteps. Economic growth has\r\n  dropped below 5%, income inequality is increasing, the government\r\n  budget deficit is growing, and international accounts are weakening.\r\n  For the long run, Syria's economy is saddled with a large number of\r\n  poorly performing public sector firms and low industrial\r\n  productivity. Oil production is likely to ebb by the end of the\r\n  decade. Unemployment will likely rise as the more than 60% of the\r\n  population under age 20 moves into the labor force. The economic\r\n  benefits of any peace treaty with Israel will depend in large part\r\n  on the pace of economic reform.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $91.2 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 4.4% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $5,900 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 30%\r\n  industry: 25%\r\n  services: 45% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 15.1% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 4.7 million (1995 est.)\r\n  by occupation: services 42%, industry 36%, agriculture 22% (1990\r\n  est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 8% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $2.5 billion\r\n  expenditures: $3.4 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: textiles, food processing, beverages, tobacco,\r\n  phosphate rock mining, petroleum\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 5% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 4,160,000 kW\r\n  production: 13.2 billion kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 865 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: wheat, barley, cotton, lentils, chickpeas;

Real growth in GDP has averaged about 9% a year during the\r\n  past three decades. Export growth has been even faster and has\r\n  provided the impetus for industrialization. Inflation and\r\n  unemployment are low. Agriculture contributes about 4% to GDP, down\r\n  from 35% in 1952. Taiwan currently ranks as number 13 among major\r\n  trading countries.

The current president,\r\nEmomali RAHMONOV, was elected in November 1994, yet has been in\r\npower since 1992. The country is suffering through its third year of\r\na civil conflict, with no clear end in sight. Underlying the\r\nconflict are deeply rooted regional and clan-based animosities that\r\npit a government consisting of people primarily from the Kulob\r\n(Kulyab), Khujand (Leninabad), and Hisor (Hissar) regions against a\r\nsecular and Islamic-led opposition from the Gharm, Gorno-Badakhshan,\r\nand Qurghonteppa (Kurgan-Tyube) regions. Government and opposition\r\nrepresentatives have held periodic rounds of UN-mediated peace talks\r\nand agreed in September 1994 to a cease-fire which has been\r\nperiodically extended. Russian-led peacekeeping troops are deployed\r\nthroughout the country, and Russian-commanded border guards are\r\nstationed along the Tajik-Afghan border.\r\n\r\nMap\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation: 39 00 N, 71 00 E -- Central Asia, west of China\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFlag\r\n----\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription: three horizontal stripes of red (top), a wider stripe\r\n  of white, and green;

Agriculture dominates the\r\n  economy, with cotton being the most important crop. Mineral\r\n  resources, varied but limited in amount, include silver, gold,\r\n  uranium, and tungsten. Industry is limited to a large aluminum\r\n  plant, hydropower facilities, and small obsolete factories mostly in\r\n  light industry and food processing. The Tajik economy has been\r\n  gravely weakened by four years of civil conflict and by the loss of\r\n  subsidies and markets for its products, which has left Tajikistan\r\n  dependent on Russia and Uzbekistan and on international humanitarian\r\n  assistance for much of its basic subsistence needs. Moreover,\r\n  constant political turmoil and the continued dominance by former\r\n  communist officials have impeded the introduction of meaningful\r\n  economic reforms. The regime has made only halfhearted efforts to\r\n  stabilize the economy and promote reform.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $6.4 billion (1995 estimate as\r\n  extrapolated from World Bank estimate for 1994)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: -12.4% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $1,040 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: NA%\r\n  industry: NA%\r\n  services: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 28% monthly average (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 1.95 million (1992)\r\n  by occupation: agriculture and forestry 43%, government and services\r\n  24%, industry 14%, trade and communications 11%, construction 8%\r\n  (1990)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 3.3% includes only officially registered\r\n  unemployed;

The economy is heavily dependent on agriculture, which\r\n  accounts for 58% of GDP, provides 85% of exports, and employs 90% of\r\n  the work force. Topography and climatic conditions, however, limit\r\n  cultivated crops to only 5% of the land area. Industry accounts for\r\n  8% of GDP and is mainly limited to processing agricultural products\r\n  and light consumer goods. The economic recovery program announced in\r\n  mid-1986 has generated notable increases in agricultural production\r\n  and financial support for the program by bilateral donors. The World\r\n  Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and bilateral donors have\r\n  provided funds to rehabilitate Tanzania's deteriorated economic\r\n  infrastructure. Growth in 1991-94 has featured a pickup in\r\n  industrial production and a substantial increase in output of\r\n  minerals, led by gold. Recent banking reforms have helped increase\r\n  private sector growth and investment.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $23.1 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 2.7% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $800 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 58%\r\n  industry: 8%\r\n  services: 34% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 25% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 13.495 million\r\n  by occupation: agriculture 90%, industry and commerce 10% (1986 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $495 million\r\n  expenditures: $631 million, including capital expenditures of $118\r\n  million (1990 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: primarily agricultural processing (sugar, beer,\r\n  cigarettes, sisal twine), diamond and gold mining, oil refining,\r\n  shoes, cement, textiles, wood products, fertilizer\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 9.3% (1990)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 440,000 kW\r\n  production: 880 million kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 30 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: coffee, sisal, tea, cotton, pyrethrum (insecticide\r\n  made from chrysanthemums), cashews, tobacco, cloves (Zanzibar),\r\n  corn, wheat, cassava (tapioca), bananas, fruits, vegetables;

Most of\r\n  Thailand's recent imports have been for capital equipment and raw\r\n  materials, although imports of consumer goods are beginning to rise.\r\n  Thailand's 35% domestic savings rate is a key source of capital for\r\n  the economy, and the country is also benefiting from rising\r\n  investment from abroad. Prime Minister BANHAN's government -\r\n  Thailand's sixth government in five years - undoubtedly will\r\n  continue Bangkok's probusiness policies despite some concerns that\r\n  it is relaxing Bangkok's traditional fiscal austerity. BANHAN is\r\n  beginning to address Thailand's serious infrastructure bottlenecks,\r\n  especially in the transport and telecommunications sectors. Over the\r\n  longer term, Bangkok must produce more college graduates with\r\n  technical training and upgrade workers' skills to continue its rapid\r\n  economic development.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $416.7 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 8.6% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $6,900 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 10.2%\r\n  industry: 30.6%\r\n  services: 59.2% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 5.8% (1995)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 32,152,600\r\n  by occupation: agriculture 57%, industry 17%, commerce 11%, services\r\n  (including government) 15% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 2.7% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $28.4 billion\r\n  expenditures: $28.4 billion, including capital expenditures of $6.1\r\n  billion (FY94/95)\r\n\r\nIndustries: tourism;

A slowdown\r\n  in the expansion of the tourism sector - especially stopover travel\r\n  from Europe - led to a reduction in the country's GDP growth rate in\r\n  1995, down to an estimated 2% from 3.5% in 1994. The construction\r\n  sector benefited from hotel rehabilitation and the government's\r\n  ongoing housing development program. Earnings from exports of\r\n  vegetable and citrus production have been decreasing since 1993 but\r\n  are expected to increase in 1996 due to storm damage to crops in\r\n  Florida. The overall growth prospects through 1996 will depend\r\n  heavily on the fortunes of the tourism sector and continued income\r\n  growth in the US, which accounts for the majority of tourist visits.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $4.8 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 2% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $18,700 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 3%\r\n  industry: 35%\r\n  services: 62% (1994)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 1.5% (1994)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 136,900 (1993)\r\n  by occupation: government 30%, tourism 40%, business services 10%,\r\n  agriculture 5% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 15% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $665 million\r\n  expenditures: $725 million, including capital expenditures of $94\r\n  million (FY95/96 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: tourism, banking, cement, oil refining and\r\n  transshipment, salt production, rum, aragonite, pharmaceuticals,\r\n  spiral-welded steel pipe\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 424,000 kW\r\n  production: 929 million kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 3,200 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: citrus, vegetables;

About 75% of\r\n  the population is engaged in crop production and livestock raising.\r\n  Small-scale manufacturing activity features the processing of\r\n  peanuts, fish, and hides. A sustained structural adjustment program,\r\n  including a liberalized trade policy, had fostered a respectable 4%\r\n  annual rate of growth in 1990-93. Reexport trade normally\r\n  constitutes one-third of economic activity; however, border closures\r\n  associated with Senegal's monetary crisis in late 1993 led to a\r\n  halving of reexport trade, reducing government revenues in turn. The\r\n  50% devaluation of the CFA franc in January 1994 has made Senegalese\r\n  goods more competitive and apparently prompted a relaxation of\r\n  Senegalese controls, paving the way for a comeback in reexports.\r\n  But, in response to the military's takeover in July 1994, cuts in\r\n  foreign trade and a decline in tourism have undermined economic\r\n  growth.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $1.1 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 2% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $1,100 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 27%\r\n  industry: 15%\r\n  services: 58% (1993)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 1.7% (1994)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 400,000 (1986 est.)\r\n  by occupation: agriculture 75.0%, industry, commerce, and services\r\n  18.9%, government 6.1%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $91.4 million\r\n  expenditures: $90 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (FY95/96 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: processing peanuts, fish, and hides;

Cocoa, coffee, and cotton together\r\n  generate about 30% of export earnings. Togo is self-sufficient in\r\n  basic foodstuffs when harvests are normal. In the industrial sector,\r\n  phosphate mining is by far the most important activity, although it\r\n  has suffered from the collapse of world phosphate prices and\r\n  increased foreign competition. Togo serves as a regional commercial\r\n  and trade center. The government's decade-long effort, supported by\r\n  the World Bank and the IMF, to implement economic reform measures,\r\n  encourage foreign investment, and bring revenues in line with\r\n  expenditures has stalled. Political unrest, including private and\r\n  public sector strikes throughout 1992 and 1993, has jeopardized the\r\n  reform program, shrunk the tax base, and disrupted vital economic\r\n  activity. Although strikes had ended in 1994, political unrest and\r\n  lack of funds prevented the government from taking advantage of the\r\n  50% currency devaluation of 12 January 1994. Resumption of World\r\n  Bank and IMF flows will depend on implementation of several\r\n  controversial moves toward privatization and on downsizing the\r\n  military, on which the regime depends to stay in power.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $4.1 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 6% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $900 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 49.2%\r\n  industry: 17.7%\r\n  services: 33.1% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 8.8% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 1.538 million (1993 est.)\r\n  by occupation: agriculture 64%, industry 9%, services 21%.\r\n  unemployed 6% (1981 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $165 million\r\n  expenditures: $274 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: phosphate mining, agricultural processing, cement;\r\n  handicrafts, textiles, beverages\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 34,000 kW\r\n  production: 41.004 million kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 9 kWh (1990)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: coffee, cocoa, cotton, yams, cassava (tapioca), corn,\r\n  beans, rice, millet, sorghum;

The country must import a high proportion of its\r\n  food, mainly from New Zealand. The manufacturing sector accounts for\r\n  only 11% of GDP. Tourism is the primary source of hard currency\r\n  earnings, but the country also remains dependent on sizable external\r\n  aid and remittances to offset its trade deficit. The economy\r\n  continued to grow in 1993-95 largely because of a rise in squash\r\n  exports, increased aid flows, and several large construction\r\n  projects. The government is now turning its attention to further\r\n  development of the private sector and the reduction of the budget\r\n  deficit.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $228 million (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 4% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $2,160 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 40% (1995 est.)\r\n  industry: NA%\r\n  services: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 3% (1993)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 32,013 (1990 est.)\r\n  by occupation: agriculture 70% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $44 million\r\n  expenditures: $86 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: tourism, fishing\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 6,000 kW\r\n  production: 30 million kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 231 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: coconuts, copra, bananas, vanilla beans, cocoa,\r\n  coffee, ginger, black pepper\r\n\r\nExports: $20.3 million (f.o.b., FY93/94)\r\n  commodities: squash, vanilla, fish, root crops, coconut oil\r\n  partners: Japan 59%, US 14%, Australia 6%, NZ 6% (FY93/94)\r\n\r\nImports: $57.8 million (c.i.f., FY93/94)\r\n  commodities: food products, machinery and transport equipment,\r\n  manufactures, fuels, chemicals\r\n  partners: NZ 44%, Australia 22%, US 8%, Japan 7% (FY93/94)\r\n\r\nExternal debt: $48.4 million (FY93/94)\r\n\r\nEconomic aid:\r\n  recipient: ODA, $NA\r\n\r\nCurrency: 1 pa'anga (T$) = 100 seniti\r\n\r\nExchange rates: pa'anga (T$) per US$1 - 1.2753 (December 1995),\r\n  1.2709 (1995), 1.3202 (1994), 1.3841 (1993), 1.3471 (1992), 1.2961\r\n  (1991)\r\n\r\nFiscal year: 1 July - 30 June\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTransportation\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n\r\nRailways: 0 km\r\n\r\nHighways:\r\n  total: 432 km\r\n  paved: 280 km\r\n  unpaved: 152 km (1987 est.)\r\n\r\nPorts: Neiafu, Nuku'alofa, Pangai\r\n\r\nMerchant marine:\r\n  total: 4 ships (1,000 GRT or over) totaling 9,990 GRT/14,884 DWT\r\n  ships by type: cargo 1, liquefied gas tanker 2, roll-on/roll-off\r\n  cargo 1 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nAirports:\r\n  total: 6\r\n  with paved runways 2 438 to 3 047 m: 1\r\n  with paved runways under 914 m: 2\r\n  with unpaved runways 1 524 to 2 437 m: 1\r\n  with unpaved runways 914 to 1 523 m: 2 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommunications\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n\r\nTelephones: 3,500 (1986 est.)\r\n\r\nTelephone system:\r\n  domestic: NA\r\n  international: satellite earth station - 1 Intelsat (Pacific Ocean)\r\n\r\nRadio broadcast stations: AM 1, FM 0, shortwave 0\r\n\r\nRadios: 66,000 (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nTelevision broadcast stations: 0\r\n\r\nTelevisions: 1,000 (1992 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDefense\r\n-------\r\n\r\n\r\nBranches: Tonga Defense Services, Maritime Division, Royal Tongan\r\n  Marines, Tongan Royal Guards, Police\r\n\r\nManpower availability:\r\n  males age 15-49: NA\r\n  males fit for military service: NA\r\n\r\nDefense expenditures: $NA, NA% of GDP\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n======================================================================\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n@Trinidad and Tobago\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMap\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation: 11 00 N, 61 00 W -- Caribbean, islands between the\r\n  Caribbean Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean, northeast of Venezuela\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFlag\r\n----\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription: red with a white-edged black diagonal band from the\r\n  upper hoist side\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeography\r\n---------\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation: Caribbean, islands between the Caribbean Sea and the\r\n  North Atlantic Ocean, northeast of Venezuela\r\n\r\nGeographic coordinates: 11 00 N, 61 00 W\r\n\r\nMap references: Central America and the Caribbean\r\n\r\nArea:\r\n  total area: 5,130 sq km\r\n  land area: 5,130 sq km\r\n  comparative area: slightly smaller than Delaware\r\n\r\nLand boundaries: 0 km\r\n\r\nCoastline: 362 km\r\n\r\nMaritime claims:\r\n  contiguous zone: 24 nm\r\n  continental shelf: 200 nm or to the outer edge of the continental\r\n  margin\r\n  exclusive economic zone: 200 nm\r\n  territorial sea: 12 nm\r\n\r\nInternational disputes: none\r\n\r\nClimate: tropical;

The country managed to record a second successive year of\r\n  economic growth in 1995, the first period of substantial expansion\r\n  since the early 1980s. A broad economic reform program, including\r\n  the floating of the exchange rate, trade and capital market\r\n  liberalization, and an extensive privatization program by the\r\n  previous administration has left the incoming PANDAY government in a\r\n  relatively sound economic position. Trinidad and Tobago's economic\r\n  prospects continue to depend heavily on world petroleum prices,\r\n  however, and further progress toward diversification will be an\r\n  important challenge in the medium term.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $16.2 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 3.5% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $12,100 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 4.8%\r\n  industry: 44.5%\r\n  services: 50.7% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 5.4% (1995)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 404,500\r\n  by occupation: construction and utilities 13%, manufacturing,\r\n  mining, and quarrying 14%, agriculture 11%, services 62% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 17.8% (December 1995)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $1.65 billion\r\n  expenditures: $1.61 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: petroleum, chemicals, tourism, food processing,\r\n  cement, beverage, cotton textiles\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 1% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 1,150,000 kW\r\n  production: 3.9 billion kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 2,740 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: cocoa, sugarcane, rice, citrus, coffee, vegetables;\r\n  poultry\r\n\r\nIllicit drugs: transshipment point for South American drugs\r\n  destined for the US and Europe and producer of cannabis\r\n\r\nExports: $2.2 billion (f.o.b., 1995)\r\n  commodities: petroleum and petroleum products, chemicals, steel\r\n  products, fertilizer, sugar, cocoa, coffee, citrus, flowers\r\n  partners: US 48%, Caricom countries15%, Latin America 9%, EU 5%\r\n  (1994)\r\n\r\nImports: $996 million (c.i.f., 1994)\r\n  commodities: machinery, transportation equipment, manufactured\r\n  goods, food, live animals\r\n  partners: US 47.7%, Venezuela 10%, UK 8.3%, other EU 8% (1994)\r\n\r\nExternal debt: $2 billion (1994)\r\n\r\nEconomic aid:\r\n  recipient: ODA, $10 million (1993)\r\n\r\nCurrency: 1 Trinidad and Tobago dollar (TT$) = 100 cents\r\n\r\nExchange rates: Trinidad and Tobago dollars (TT$) per US$1 -\r\n  5.9412 (January 1996), 5.9192 (1995), 5.9249 (1994), 5.3511 (1993),\r\n  4.2500 (fixed rate 1989-1992);

Real growth has averaged 4.2% in 1991-95,\r\n  and inflation has been moderate. Growth in tourism and IMF support\r\n  have been key elements in this solid record. Drought, especially in\r\n  the south, held back GDP growth in 1995.

Since World\r\n  War II, it has become increasingly integrated into the West European\r\n  economic arena, for example, as a member of OECD. The economy has\r\n  improved significantly since the 1994 crisis, when the economy\r\n  experienced a sharp drop and inflation hit triple digits. The crisis\r\n  - sparked by the downgrading in January 1994 of Turkey's\r\n  international credit rating by two US rating agencies - stemmed from\r\n  years of loose monetary and fiscal policies that had exacerbated\r\n  inflation and allowed the public debt, money supply, and current\r\n  account deficit to explode. In April 1994, then Prime Minister\r\n  CILLER introduced a stabilization package that paved the way for a\r\n  $950 million IMF standby loan. However, because the government\r\n  missed key macroeconomic targets in 1995 and the December national\r\n  election produced months of political wrangling, the IMF put the\r\n  agreement - and release of remaining funds - on hold. The new\r\n  center-right minority government that finally has emerged will find\r\n  it difficult to balance the need for new austerity measures and\r\n  tough structural reforms with the pressure for continued buoyant\r\n  growth. Ankara is also likely to face internal opposition to\r\n  policies it must implement as part of the Turkey-EU customs union\r\n  agreement - which came into force on 1 January 1996 - because many\r\n  industries are unfit for EU competition and much-needed revenues\r\n  will decline with the elimination of import tariffs and surcharges.\r\n  Meanwhile, Ankara's heavy debt repayment schedule in 1996 makes it\r\n  necessary for Turkish leaders to bolster the confidence of both\r\n  domestic and foreign investors.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $345.7 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 6.8% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $5,500 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 15.5%\r\n  industry: 33.2%\r\n  services: 51.3% (1994)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 94% (1995)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 20.9 million\r\n  by occupation: agriculture 46%, services 31%, industry 23%\r\n  note: about 1.5 million Turks work abroad (1994)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 10.2% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $30.2 billion\r\n  expenditures: $35 billion, including capital expenditures of $2.8\r\n  billion (1995)\r\n\r\nIndustries: textiles, food processing, mining (coal, chromite,\r\n  copper, boron), steel, petroleum, construction, lumber, paper\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 8.8% (1995)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 18,710,000 kW\r\n  production: 71 billion kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 1,079 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: tobacco, cotton, grain, olives, sugar beets, pulses,\r\n  citrus;

One-half of its irrigated land is\r\n  planted in cotton making it the world's tenth largest producer. It\r\n  also has the world's fifth largest reserves of natural gas and\r\n  substantial oil resources. Until the end of 1993, Turkmenistan had\r\n  experienced less economic disruption than other former Soviet states\r\n  because its economy received a boost from higher prices for oil and\r\n  gas and a sharp increase in hard currency earnings. In 1994,\r\n  Russia's refusal to export Turkmen gas to hard currency markets and\r\n  mounting debts of its major customers in the former USSR for gas\r\n  deliveries contributed to a sharp fall in industrial production and\r\n  caused the budget to shift from a surplus to a slight deficit. The\r\n  economy remained depressed through 1995 while inflation soared.\r\n  Furthermore, with an authoritarian ex-communist regime in power and\r\n  a tribally based social structure, Turkmenistan has taken a cautious\r\n  approach to economic reform, hoping to use gas and cotton sales to\r\n  sustain its inefficient economy.

The US was the\r\n  leading source of tourists in 1995, accounting for upward of 70% of\r\n  arrivals or about 60,000 visitors. Major sources of government\r\n  revenue include fees from offshore financial activities and customs\r\n  receipts as the Islands rely on imports for nearly all consumption\r\n  and capital goods.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $80.8 million (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: -1.5% (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $6,000 (1992 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: NA%\r\n  industry: NA%\r\n  services: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): NA%\r\n\r\nLabor force: 4,848 (1990 est.)\r\n  by occupation: majority engaged in fishing and tourist industries;\r\n  some subsistence agriculture\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 12% (1992)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $31.9 million (1995)\r\n  expenditures: $30.4 million (1995), including capital expenditures\r\n  of $NA\r\n\r\nIndustries: fishing, tourism, offshore financial services\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 9,050 kW\r\n  production: 11.1 million kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 860 kWh (1992)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: corn, beans;

Agriculture is the most important\r\n  sector of the economy, employing over 80% of the work force. Coffee\r\n  is the major export crop and accounts for the bulk of export\r\n  revenues. Since 1986 the government - with the support of foreign\r\n  countries and international agencies - has acted to rehabilitate and\r\n  stabilize the economy by undertaking currency reform, raising\r\n  producer prices on export crops, increasing prices of petroleum\r\n  products, and improving civil service wages. The policy changes are\r\n  especially aimed at dampening inflation and boosting production and\r\n  export earnings. In 1990-94, the economy turned in a solid\r\n  performance based on continued investment in the rehabilitation of\r\n  infrastructure, improved incentives for production and exports, and\r\n  gradually improving domestic security. The economy again prospered\r\n  in 1995 with rapid growth, low inflation, growing foreign\r\n  investment, a trimmed bureaucracy, and the continued return of\r\n  exiled Indian-Ugandan entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $16.8 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 7.1% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $900 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 55%\r\n  industry: 12%\r\n  services: 33% (1995)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 6.1% (1995)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 8.361 million (1993 est.)\r\n  by occupation: agriculture 86%, industry 4%, services 10% (1980 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $574 million\r\n  expenditures: $1.07 billion, including capital expenditures of $328\r\n  million (1994/95 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: sugar, brewing, tobacco, cotton textiles, cement\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 15% (1994)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 162,000 kW\r\n  production: 603 million kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 30 kWh (1990)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: coffee, tea, cotton, tobacco, cassava (tapioca),\r\n  potatoes, corn, millet, pulses;

Its fertile black soil generated more than one-fourth of\r\n  Soviet agricultural output, and its farms provided substantial\r\n  quantities of meat, milk, grain, and vegetables to other republics.\r\n  Likewise, its diversified heavy industry supplied equipment and raw\r\n  materials to industrial and mining sites in other regions of the\r\n  former USSR. In early 1992, the Ukrainian Government liberalized\r\n  most prices and erected a legal framework for privatization, but\r\n  widespread resistance to reform within the government and the\r\n  legislature soon stalled reform efforts and led to some\r\n  backtracking. Loose monetary policies pushed inflation to\r\n  hyperinflationary levels in late 1993. Since his election in July\r\n  1994, President KUCHMA has developed a comprehensive economic reform\r\n  program, maintained financial discipline, and removed almost all\r\n  controls over prices and foreign trade. Implementation of KUCHMA's\r\n  economic agenda is encountering considerable resistance from\r\n  parliament, entrenched bureaucrats, and industrial interests.\r\n  However, should KUCHMA succeed in implementing aggressive market\r\n  reforms during 1996, the economy may stabilize and possibly achieve\r\n  real growth in the range of 0.5%-1%.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $174.6 billion (1995 estimate as\r\n  extrapolated from World Bank estimate for 1994)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: -4% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $3,370 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 31%\r\n  industry: 43%\r\n  services: 26% (1993 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 9% monthly average (1995)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 23.55 million (January 1994)\r\n  by occupation: industry and construction 33%, agriculture and\r\n  forestry 21%, health, education, and culture 16%, trade and\r\n  distribution 7%, transport and communication 7%, other 16% (1992)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 0.7% officially registered;

Its wealth is based on oil and gas output (about 33% of\r\n  GDP), and the fortunes of the economy fluctuate with the prices of\r\n  those commodities. Since 1973, the UAE has undergone a profound\r\n  transformation from an impoverished region of small desert\r\n  principalities to a modern state with a high standard of living. At\r\n  present levels of production, crude oil reserves should last for\r\n  over 100 years.

The economy is essentially capitalistic;\r\n  over the past 13 years the ruling Tories have greatly reduced public\r\n  ownership and contained the growth of social welfare programs.\r\n  Agriculture is intensive, highly mechanized, and efficient by\r\n  European standards, producing about 60% of food needs with only\r\n  about 1% of the labor force. The UK has large coal, natural gas, and\r\n  oil reserves, and primary energy production accounts for 12% of GDP,\r\n  one of the highest shares of any industrial nation. Services,\r\n  particularly banking, insurance, and business services, account by\r\n  far for the largest proportion of GDP while industry continues to\r\n  decline in importance, now employing only 25% of the work force. The\r\n  economy registered 3.9% GDP growth in 1994, the best rate for six\r\n  years, but slipped back to 2.7% in 1995. Exports and manufacturing\r\n  output have been the primary engines of growth. Unemployment is\r\n  gradually falling. Inflation is at a tolerable 3%. A major economic\r\n  policy question for the UK in the 1990s is the terms on which it\r\n  participates in the financial and economic integration of Europe.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $1.1384 trillion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 2.7% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $19,500 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 1.7%\r\n  industry: 27.7%\r\n  services: 70.6% (1993)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 3.1% (November 1995)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 28.048 million\r\n  by occupation: services 62.8%, manufacturing and construction 25.0%,\r\n  government 9.1%, energy 1.9%, agriculture 1.2% (June 1992)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 8% (December 1995)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $388.9 billion\r\n  expenditures: $447.6 billion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (FY94/95 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: production machinery including machine tools, electric\r\n  power equipment, automation equipment, railroad equipment,\r\n  shipbuilding, aircraft, motor vehicles and parts, electronics and\r\n  communications equipment, metals, chemicals, coal, petroleum, paper\r\n  and paper products, food processing, textiles, clothing, and other\r\n  consumer goods\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 1.9% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 65,360,000 kW\r\n  production: 303 billion kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 5,123 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: cereals, oilseed, potatoes, vegetables;

In this\r\n  market-oriented economy, private individuals and business firms make\r\n  most of the decisions, and government purchases of goods and\r\n  services are made predominantly in the marketplace. US business\r\n  firms enjoy considerably greater flexibility than their counterparts\r\n  in Western Europe and Japan in decisions to expand capital plant,\r\n  lay off surplus workers, and develop new products. At the same time,\r\n  they face higher barriers to entry in their rivals' home markets\r\n  than the barriers to entry of foreign firms in US markets. In all\r\n  economic sectors, US firms are at or near the forefront in\r\n  technological advances, especially in computers, medical equipment,\r\n  and aerospace, although their advantage has steadily narrowed since\r\n  the end of World War II. The onrush of technology largely explains\r\n  the gradual development of a \"two-tier labor market\" in which those\r\n  at the bottom lack the education and professional/technical skills\r\n  of those at the top and, more and more, fail to get pay raises,\r\n  health insurance coverage, and other benefits. The years 1994-95\r\n  witnessed moderate gains in real output, low inflation rates, and a\r\n  drop in unemployment below 6%. The capture of both houses of\r\n  Congress by the Republicans in the elections of 8 November 1994 has\r\n  intensified the debate over how the US should address its major\r\n  economic problems. These problems include inadequate investment in\r\n  economic infrastructure, rapidly rising medical costs of an aging\r\n  population, sizable budget and trade deficits, and stagnation of\r\n  family income in the lower economic groups. The outlook for 1996 is\r\n  for continued moderate growth, low inflation, and about the same\r\n  level of unemployment.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $7.2477 trillion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 2.1% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $27,500 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 2%\r\n  industry: 23%\r\n  services: 75% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 2.5% (1995)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 132.304 million (includes unemployed) (1995)\r\n  by occupation: managerial and professional 28.3%, technical, sales\r\n  and administrative support 30.0%, services 13.5%, manufacturing,\r\n  mining, transportation, and crafts 25.3%, farming, forestry, and\r\n  fishing 2.8%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 5.6% (December 1995)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $1.258 trillion\r\n  expenditures: $1.461 trillion, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1994)\r\n\r\nIndustries: leading industrial power in the world, highly\r\n  diversified and technologically advanced;

Economic development has been restrained in recent years\r\n  by high - though declining - inflation and extensive government\r\n  regulation. The SANGUINETTI government's conservative monetary and\r\n  fiscal policies are aimed at continuing to reduce inflation,\r\n  currently at 35.4%; other priorities include extensive reform of the\r\n  social security system and increased investment in education.\r\n  Uruguay went into recession during second quarter 1995 and ended the\r\n  year with an estimated 2% fall in GDP and a two percentage point\r\n  rise in unemployment to 11%. This was partly due to Argentina's\r\n  recession and the slowdown in Brazilian growth in 1995, which\r\n  contributed to declines in the Uruguayan manufacturing,\r\n  construction, and service sectors. However, despite its Mercosur\r\n  (Southern Cone Common Market) partners' troubles, Uruguayan trade\r\n  expanded and potential new markets are being explored through\r\n  Mercosur negotiations with neighboring countries and the European\r\n  Union (EU). Uruguay also recently augmented its transport and\r\n  agricultural sector ties with the US. The economy is expected to\r\n  come out of recession as regional growth prospects improve.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $24.4 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: -2.4% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $7,600 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 10.5%\r\n  industry: 27.5%\r\n  services: 62% (1994)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 35.4% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 1.355 million (1991 est.)\r\n  by occupation: government 25%, manufacturing 19%, agriculture 11%,\r\n  commerce 12%, utilities, construction, transport, and communications\r\n  12%, other services 21% (1988 est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 11% (1995)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $3.03 billion\r\n  expenditures: $3.37 billion with capital expenditures of $NA (1994\r\n  est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: meat processing, wool and hides, sugar, textiles,\r\n  footwear, leather apparel, tires, cement, petroleum refining, wine\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: -19% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 2,070,000 kW\r\n  production: 9 billion kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 1,575 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: wheat, rice, corn, sorghum;

At the same time, Uzbekistan is the world's third\r\n  largest cotton exporter, a major producer of gold and natural gas,\r\n  and a regionally significant producer of chemicals and machinery.\r\n  Following independence, the government sought to prop up its\r\n  Soviet-style command economy with subsidies and tight controls on\r\n  production and prices. Faced with high rates of inflation, however,\r\n  the government stepped up the pace of reform in mid-1994, by\r\n  introducing tighter monetary policies, expanding privatization,\r\n  reducing the role of the state in the economy, and improving the\r\n  environment for foreign investors.

Utilization rates for official development assistance are\r\n  also increasing, rising to an estimated $535 million in 1995.\r\n  Foreign capital is contributing to a boom in commercial construction\r\n  and strong growth in services and industrial output. Crude oil\r\n  remains the country's largest single export but now accounts for\r\n  only one-quarter of total exports, slightly more than manufactures.\r\n  Imports are dominated by capital and intermediate goods closely\r\n  related to investment outlays. Vietnamese authorities may not be\r\n  moving quickly enough to establish the financial and legal\r\n  infrastructure needed to sustain growth through the remainder of the\r\n  decade. Reform of the banking sector is proceeding slowly, raising\r\n  concerns that the country will be unable to tap sufficient domestic\r\n  savings to maintain rapid growth. Administrative and legal barriers\r\n  are leading to costly delays for foreign investors, raising doubts\r\n  about Vietnam's ability to maintain the inflow of foreign capital.\r\n  While government officials are leading an effort to accelerate\r\n  reform, their continuing ideological bias in favor of state\r\n  intervention and control of the economy may slow progress toward a\r\n  more liberalized investment environment. Even with the strong growth\r\n  of the economy, unemployment at 25% remains a major problem.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $97 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 9.5% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $1,300 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 28%\r\n  industry: 28%\r\n  services: 44% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 14% (1995)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 32.7 million\r\n  by occupation: agricultural 65%, industrial and service 35% (1990\r\n  est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 25% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $4.67 billion\r\n  expenditures: $5 billion, including capital expenditures of $1.36\r\n  billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: food processing, textiles, machine building, mining,\r\n  cement, chemical fertilizer, glass, tires, oil\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: 14% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 4,470,000 kW\r\n  production: 20 billion kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 200 kWh (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: paddy rice, corn, potatoes, rubber, soybeans, coffee,\r\n  tea, bananas;

About 4% of the population is employed\r\n  in government. Revenues come from French Government subsidies,\r\n  licensing of fishing rights to Japan and South Korea, import taxes,\r\n  and remittances from expatriate workers in New Caledonia. Wallis and\r\n  Futuna imports food - particularly sugar, rice, and beef - fuel,\r\n  clothing, machinery, and transport equipment, but its exports are\r\n  negligible, consisting of copra and handicrafts.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $28.7 million (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $2,500 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: NA%\r\n  industry: NA%\r\n  services: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): NA%\r\n\r\nLabor force: NA\r\n  by occupation: agriculture, livestock, and fishing 80%, government\r\n  4% (est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $14.04 million\r\n  expenditures: $14.04 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: copra, handicrafts, fishing, lumber\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 1,200 kW\r\n  production: 1 million kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 70 kWh (1990)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: yams, taro, bananas; pigs, goats\r\n\r\nExports: $370,000 (f.o.b., 1995 est.)\r\n  commodities: copra, handicrafts\r\n  partners: NA\r\n\r\nImports: $13.5 million (c.i.f., 1995 est.)\r\n  commodities: foodstuffs, manufactured goods, transportation\r\n  equipment, fuel, clothing\r\n  partners: France, Australia, New Zealand\r\n\r\nExternal debt: $NA\r\n\r\nEconomic aid:\r\n  recipient: ODA, $NA\r\n\r\nCurrency: 1 CFP franc (CFPF) = 100 centimes\r\n\r\nExchange rates: Comptoirs Francais du Pacifique francs (CFPF) per\r\n  US$1 - 91.00 (January 1996), 90.75 (1995), 100.94 (1994), 102.96\r\n  (1993), 96.24 (1992), 102.57 (1991); note - linked at the rate of\r\n  18.18 to the French franc\r\n\r\nFiscal year: calendar year\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTransportation\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n\r\nRailways: 0 km\r\n\r\nHighways:\r\n  total: 120 km (Ile Uvea 100 km, Ile Futuna 20 km)\r\n  paved: 16 km (all on Ile Uvea)\r\n  unpaved: 104 km (Ile Uvea 84 km, Ile Futuna 20 km)\r\n\r\nWaterways: none\r\n\r\nPorts: Leava, Mata-Utu\r\n\r\nMerchant marine:\r\n  total: 1 oil tanker (1,000 GRT or over) totaling 26,000 GRT/40,000\r\n  DWT (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nAirports:\r\n  total: 2\r\n  with paved runways 1 524 to 2 437 m: 1\r\n  with unpaved runways 914 to 1 523 m: 1 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommunications\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n\r\nTelephones: 340 (1985 est.)\r\n\r\nTelephone system:\r\n  domestic: NA\r\n  international: NA\r\n\r\nRadio broadcast stations: AM 1, FM 0, shortwave 0\r\n\r\nRadios: NA\r\n\r\nTelevision broadcast stations: 0\r\n\r\nTelevisions: NA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDefense\r\n-------\r\n\r\n\r\nDefense note: defense is the responsibility of France\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n======================================================================\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n@West Bank\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe Israel-PLO Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government\r\nArrangements (\"the DOP\"), signed in Washington on 13 September 1993,\r\nprovides for a transitional period not exceeding five years of\r\nPalestinian interim self-government in the Gaza Strip and the West\r\nBank.

A transfer of powers and responsibilities for\r\n  the Gaza Strip and Jericho has taken place pursuant to the\r\n  Israel-PLO 4 May 1994 Cairo Agreement on the Gaza Strip and the\r\n  Jericho Area. A transfer of powers and responsibilities in certain\r\n  spheres for the rest of the West Bank has taken place pursuant to\r\n  the Israel-PLO 29 August 1994 Agreement on Preparatory Transfer of\r\n  Powers and Responsibilities. A transfer of powers and\r\n  responsibilities in additional areas of the West Bank has taken\r\n  place pursuant to the Israel-PLO 28 September 1995 Interim\r\n  Agreement.

Industries using advanced\r\n  technology or requiring sizable investment have been discouraged by\r\n  a lack of local capital and restrictive Israeli policies. Capital\r\n  investment consists largely of residential housing, not productive\r\n  assets that would enable local Palestinian firms to compete with\r\n  Israeli industry. GDP has been substantially supplemented by\r\n  remittances of workers employed in Israel and Persian Gulf states.\r\n  Such transfers from the Gulf dropped after Iraq invaded Kuwait in\r\n  August 1990. In the wake of the Persian Gulf crisis, many\r\n  Palestinians have returned to the West Bank, increasing\r\n  unemployment, and export revenues have dropped because of the\r\n  decline of markets in Jordan and the Gulf states. The area's\r\n  economic situation has worsened since Israel imposed stringent\r\n  border restrictions in 1995 and 1996.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $3.7 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 3%-4% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $2,500 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 33%\r\n  industry: 7%\r\n  services: 60% (1995 est., includes Gaza Strip)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 14% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: NA\r\n  by occupation: construction 28.2%, agriculture 21.8%, industry\r\n  14.5%, commerce, restaurants, and hotels 12.6%, other services 22.9%\r\n  (1991)\r\n  note: excluding Israeli settlers\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 25%-30% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nBudget: $NA\r\n\r\nIndustries: generally small family businesses that produce cement,\r\n  textiles, soap, olive-wood carvings, and mother-of-pearl souvenirs;\r\n  the Israelis have established some small-scale, modern industries in\r\n  the settlements and industrial centers\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: NA kW\r\n  production: NA kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: NA kWh\r\n  note: most electricity imported from Israel;

The economy depends on emigrant remittances and foreign aid\r\n  to supplement GDP and to support a level of imports much greater\r\n  than export earnings. Tourism has become the most important growth\r\n  industry. The economy continued to falter in 1994, as remittances\r\n  and tourist earnings remained low. Production of taro, the primary\r\n  food export crop, dropped 97% in 1993/94 when a fungal disease\r\n  threatened the country's basic food crops.

And once more, results varied widely\r\n  among regions and countries. Average growth of 2.5% in the GDP of\r\n  industrialized countries (56% of GWP in 1995) and average growth of\r\n  5% in the GDP of less developed countries (38% of GWP) were partly\r\n  offset by a small 1.5% drop in the GDP of the former USSR/Eastern\r\n  Europe area (only 6% of GWP). With the notable exception of Japan at\r\n  3.1%, unemployment was typically 6%-12% in the industrial world. The\r\n  US accounted for 22% of GWP in 1995; Western Europe accounted for\r\n  21%; and Japan accounted for 8%. These are the three \"economic\r\n  superpowers\" presumably destined to compete for mastery in\r\n  international markets on into the 21st century. As for the less\r\n  developed countries: China, India, and the Four Dragons - South\r\n  Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore - once again posted records\r\n  of 5% growth or better; however, many other countries, especially in\r\n  Africa, continued to suffer from drought, rapid population growth,\r\n  inflation, and civil strife. Central Europe continued its progress\r\n  in moving toward \"market-friendly\" economies. The 15 ex-Soviet\r\n  countries typically experienced further declines in output, although\r\n  considerably less than in 1992-94. Externally, the nation-state, as\r\n  a bedrock economic-political institution, is steadily losing control\r\n  over international flows of people, goods, funds, and technology.\r\n  Internally, the central government in a number of cases is losing\r\n  control over resources as separatist regional movements - typically\r\n  based on ethnicity - gain momentum, e.g., in the successor states of\r\n  the former Soviet Union, in the former Yugoslavia, in India, and in\r\n  Canada. In Western Europe, governments face the difficult political\r\n  problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order\r\n  to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment.\r\n  The addition of nearly 100 million people each year to an already\r\n  overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of pollution,\r\n  desertification, underemployment, epidemics, and famine. Because of\r\n  their own internal problems, the industrialized countries have\r\n  inadequate resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of\r\n  the world, which, at least from the economic point of view, are\r\n  becoming further marginalized.

Future economic development depends heavily on\r\n  Western-assisted development of the country's moderate oil\r\n  resources. Former South Yemen's willingness to merge stemmed partly\r\n  from the steady decline in Soviet economic support. The low level of\r\n  domestic industry and agriculture has made northern Yemen dependent\r\n  on imports for practically all of its essential needs. Once\r\n  self-sufficient in food production, northern Yemen has become a\r\n  major importer. Land once used for export crops - cotton, fruit, and\r\n  vegetables - has been turned over to growing a shrub called qat,\r\n  whose leaves are chewed for their stimulant effect by Yemenis and\r\n  which has no significant export market. Economic growth in former\r\n  South Yemen has been constrained by a lack of incentives, partly\r\n  stemming from centralized control over production decisions,\r\n  investment allocation, and import choices. Yemen's large trade\r\n  deficits have been compensated for by remittances from Yemenis\r\n  working abroad and by foreign aid. Since the Gulf crisis,\r\n  remittances have dropped substantially. High inflation and political\r\n  divisions hinder the development of a forward-looking economic\r\n  policy.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $37.1 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: 3.6% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $2,520 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 21%\r\n  industry: 24%\r\n  services: 55%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 71.3% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: no reliable estimates exist, most people are employed\r\n  in agriculture and herding or as expatriate laborers;

While meaningful economic figures are\r\n  difficult to come by, Zaire's hyperinflation, chronic large\r\n  government deficits, and plunging mineral production have made the\r\n  country one of the world's poorest. Most formal transactions are\r\n  conducted in hard currency as indigenous bank notes have lost almost\r\n  all value, and a barter economy now flourishes in all but the\r\n  largest cities. Most individuals and families hang on grimly through\r\n  subsistence farming and petty trade. The government has not been\r\n  able to meet its financial obligations to the IMF nor put in place\r\n  the financial measures advocated by it. Although short-term\r\n  prospects for improvement remain doubtful, improved political\r\n  stability would boost Zaire's long-term potential to effectively\r\n  exploit its vast mineral and agricultural resources.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $16.5 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: -7.4% (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $400 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: NA%\r\n  industry: NA%\r\n  services: NA%\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 12% monthly average (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 14.51 million (1993 est.)\r\n  by occupation: agriculture 65%, industry 16%, services 19% (1991\r\n  est.)\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: NA%\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $479 million\r\n  expenditures: $479 million, including capital expenditures of $NA\r\n  (1996 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: mining, mineral processing, consumer products\r\n  (including textiles, footwear, cigarettes, processed foods and\r\n  beverages), cement, diamonds\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: -20% (1993)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 2,830,000 kW\r\n  production: 6.2 billion kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 133 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: coffee, sugar, palm oil, rubber, tea, quinine,\r\n  cassava (tapioca), palm oil, bananas, root crops, corn, fruits;

Inflation, while slowing somewhat, continues to be a\r\n  major concern to the CHILUBA government. Four of Zambia's 20 banks\r\n  collapsed in 1995, and the nation's debt stood at about $7 billion.\r\n  Zambia's copper mining sector, which accounts for over 80% of the\r\n  nation's foreign currency intake, is struggling. Production rates\r\n  are down as are world copper prices. Food production is insufficient\r\n  to meet the country's needs due to previous droughts and an end to\r\n  government subsidization of agriculture. While the government's\r\n  economic program aims for 6% growth in each of the next three years,\r\n  a growth rate of 3-5% is more likely.\r\n\r\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $8.9 billion (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP real growth rate: NA%\r\n\r\nGDP per capita: $900 (1995 est.)\r\n\r\nGDP composition by sector:\r\n  agriculture: 32%\r\n  industry: 22%\r\n  services: 46% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 55% (1994 est.)\r\n\r\nLabor force: 3.4 million\r\n  by occupation: agriculture 85%, mining, manufacturing, and\r\n  construction 6%, transport and services 9%\r\n\r\nUnemployment rate: 22% (1991)\r\n\r\nBudget:\r\n  revenues: $665 million\r\n  expenditures: $767 million, including capital expenditures of $300\r\n  million (1991 est.)\r\n\r\nIndustries: copper mining and processing, construction,\r\n  foodstuffs, beverages, chemicals, textiles, fertilizer\r\n\r\nIndustrial production growth rate: -1% (1992)\r\n\r\nElectricity:\r\n  capacity: 2,440,000 kW\r\n  production: 7.8 billion kWh\r\n  consumption per capita: 650 kWh (1993)\r\n\r\nAgriculture: corn, sorghum, rice, peanuts, sunflower seed,\r\n  tobacco, cotton, sugarcane, cassava (tapioca);

Mining\r\n  accounts for only 5% of both GDP and employment, but minerals and\r\n  metals account for about 40% of exports. Severe drought caused GDP\r\n  to drop 8% in 1992, with growth rebounding to 2% in 1993 and 4.5% in\r\n  1994, only to drop by 2.4% in 1995.
