B.\r\nLIPPINCOTT & CO., in the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PALACE OF THE LEATHERSTONEPAUGHS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUINS OF THE PALACES OF THE CÆSARS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery sentimental traveller to Rome must sometimes wonder if to come to\r\nthe Eternal City is not, after all, more of a loss than a gain: Rome\r\nunvisited holds such a solitary place in one's imaginings. It is then a\r\nplace around which sweeps a different atmosphere from that of any other\r\ncity under the sun. One sees it through poetic mists that veil every\r\nprosaic reality. It is arched by an horizon against which the figures of\r\nits wonderful history are shadowed with scarcely less of grandeur and\r\nglory than those the old gods cast upon the Sacred Hill.\r\n\r\nOne who has never seen Rome is thus led to imagine that those of his\r\ncountry-people who have lived here for years have become in a manner\r\npurged of all natural commonplaceness. One thinks of them as\r\nrefined--sublimated, so to speak--into beings worthy of reverence and to\r\nbe spoken of with awed admiration. For have not their feet wandered\r\nwhere the Caesars' feet have trod, till that famous ground has become\r\ncommon earth to them? Have they not dwelt in the shadow of mountains\r\nthat have trembled beneath the tramp of Goth, Visigoth and Ostrogoth,\r\ntill those shadows have become every-day shadows to them? Have they not\r\noften watched beneath the same stars that shone upon knightly vigils,\r\ntill the whiteness of those shining hosts has made pure their souls as\r\nit purified the heroic ones of old? Have they not listened to the\r\nsinging and sighing of the selfsame winds that sung and sighed about the\r\nspot where kingly Numa wooed a nymph, till it must be that into the\r\ncommoner natures has entered some of the sweetness and wisdom of that\r\nhalf-divine communion?\r\n\r\nThus the dreamer comes to Rome expecting to enter and become enfolded by\r\nthose poetic mists, to live an ideal life amid the tender melancholy\r\nthat broods over stately and storied ruin, and to forget for evermore,\r\nwhile within the wondrous precincts, that aught more prosaic exists than\r\nthe heroes of history, the fairest visions of art and dreams of poesy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"GHOSTS OF FLEAS\" (Copied From Sketches Of William\r\nBlake).]\r\n\r\nSo came the Leatherstonepaughs. And so have the Leatherstonepaughs\r\nsometimes wondered if, after all, to come to Rome is not more of a loss\r\nthan a gain in the dimming of one of their fairest ideals. For is there\r\nanother city in the world where certain of the vulgar verities of life\r\npress themselves more prominently into view than in the Eternal City?\r\nCan one anywhere have a more forcible conviction that greasy cookery is\r\nbile-provoking, and that it is because the sylvan bovine ruminates so\r\nlong upon the melancholy Campagna that one's dinners become such a heavy\r\nand sorrowful matter in Rome? Is there any city in the universe where\r\nfleas dwarf more colossally and fiendishly Blake's famous \"ghosts\" of\r\ntheir kind? Does one anywhere come oftener in from wet streets, \"a dem'd\r\nmoist, unpleasant body,\" to more tomblike rooms? Is one anywhere so\r\nceaselessly haunted by the disagreeable consciousness that one pays ten\r\ntimes as much for everything one buys as a native pays, and that the\r\ntrousered descendant of the toga'd Roman regards the Western barbarian\r\nas quite as much his legitimate prey as the barbarian's barelegged\r\nancestors were the prey of his forefathers before the tables of history\r\nwere turned, Rome fallen and breeches supplied to all the world? And are\r\nany mortal vistas more gorgeously illuminated by the red guidebook of\r\nthe Tourist than are the stately and storied ruins where the\r\nsentimentalist seeketh the brooding of a tender melancholy, and\r\nfindeth it not in the presence of couriers, cabmen, beggars,\r\nphotograph-peddlers, stovepipe hats, tie-backs and bridal giggles?\r\n\r\nThe dreamer thought to find old Rome crystallized amid its glorious\r\nmemories. He finds a nineteenth-century city, with gay shops and\r\nfashionable streets, living over the heroic scenes of the ancients and\r\nthe actual woe and spiritual mysticism of the mediæval age; and he is\r\ndisappointed--nay, even sometimes enraged into a gnashing of the teeth\r\nat all things Roman.\r\n\r\nBut after many weeks, after the sights have been \"done,\" the mouldy and\r\nmossy nooks of the old city explored, and the marvellous picturesqueness\r\nthat hides in strange places revealed--after one has a speaking\r\nacquaintance with all the broken bits of old statues that gather moth\r\nand rust where the tourist cometh not and the guidebook is not known,\r\nand has followed the tiniest thread of legend or tradition into all\r\nmanner of mysterious regions,--then the sentimentalist begins to love\r\nRome again--Rome as it is, not Rome as it seemed through the glamours of\r\nindividual imagination.\r\n\r\nThis is what the Leatherstonepaughs did. But first they fled the\r\ncompanionship of the beloved but somewhat loudly-shrieking American\r\neagle as that proud bird often appears in the hotels and _pensions_ of\r\nEurope, and lived in a shabby Roman palace, where only the soft bastard\r\nLatin was heard upon the stairs, and where, if any mediæval ghost\r\nstalked in rusted armor or glided in mouldering cerements, it would not\r\nunderstand a single word of their foreign, many-consonanted speech.\r\n\r\nThis palace stands, gay and grim, at the corner of a gay street and a\r\ndingy _vicolo_, the street and alley contrasting in color like a Claude\r\nLorraine with a Nicholas Poussin. Past one side of the palace drifts all\r\nday a bright tide of foreign sightseers, prosperous Romans, gay models\r\nand flower-venders, handsome carriages, dark-eyed girls with their\r\nsallow chaperones, and olive-cheeked, huge-checked _jeunesse dorée_,\r\nevidently seeking for pretty faces as for pearls of great price, as is\r\nthe manner of the jeunesse dorée of the Eternal City; while down upon\r\nthe scene looks a succession of dwelling-houses, a gray-walled convent\r\nor two, one of the stateliest palaces of Rome--now let out in apartments\r\nand hiding in obscure rooms the last two impoverished descendants of a\r\nproud race that helped to impoverish Rome--one or two more prosperous\r\npalaces, and a venerable church, looking like a sleepy watchman of Zion\r\nsuffering the enemy to do as it will before his closed eyes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHAT A ROMAN BUYS FOR TWO CENTS IN THE ETERNAL CITY.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHAT A FOREIGNER BUYS FOR TWO CENTS IN THE ETERNAL CITY.]\r\n\r\nOn the other side is the vicolo, dark of wall and dank of pavement, with\r\npetticoats and shirts dangling from numerous windows and fluttering like\r\ngibbeted wretches in the air; with frowzy women sewing or knitting in\r\nthe sombre doorways and squalid urchins screaming everywhere; with\r\nhumble vegetables and cheap wines exposed for sale in dirty windows;\r\nwith usually a carriage or two undergoing a washing at some stable-door;\r\nand with almost always an amorous Romeo or two from some brighter region\r\nwandering hopefully to and fro amid the unpicturesque gloom of this\r\nRoman lane to catch a wafted kiss or a dropped letter from the rear\r\nwindow of his Juliet's home. For nowhere else in Europe, Asia, America,\r\nthe Oceanic Archipelago or the Better Land can the Romeo-and-Juliet\r\nbusiness be more openly and freely carried on than in the by-streets of\r\nthe Eternal City, where girls are thought to be as jealously secluded\r\nfrom the monster Man as are the women of a Turkish seraglio or the nuns\r\nof a European convent. These Romeos and Juliets usually seem quite\r\nindifferent to the number of unsympathetic eyes that watch their little\r\ndrama, providing only Papa and Mamma Capulet are kept in the dark in the\r\nshop below. Even the observation of Signor and Signora Montague would\r\ndisturb them little, for it is only Juliet who is guarded, and Romeo is\r\nevidently expected to get all the fun out of life he can. In their dingy\r\nvicolo the Leatherstonepaughs have seen three Romeos watching three\r\nwindows at the same twilight moment. One of them stood under an open\r\nwindow in the third story, from whence a line was dropped down to\r\nreceive the letter he held in his hand. Just as the letter-weighted line\r\nwas drawn up a window immediately below Juliet's was thrown violently\r\nopen, and an unromantic head appeared to empty vials of wrath upon the\r\nspectacled Romeo below for always hanging about the windows of the silly\r\n_pizzicarole_ girls above and giving the house a ridiculous appearance\r\nin the eyes of the passers-by. Romeo answered audaciously that the\r\nsignora was mistaken in the man, that he had never been under that\r\nwindow before in his life, had never seen the Signorina Juliet, daughter\r\nof Capulet the pizzicarole who lived above, but that he was merely\r\naccompanying his friend Romeo, who loved Juliet the daughter of the\r\n_drochiere_ who lived a story below, and who was now wooing her softly\r\ntwo or three windows away. A shriek was his response as the wrathful\r\nhead disappeared, while the lying Romeo laughed wickedly and the\r\nLeatherstonepaughs immoderately, in spite of themselves, to see Juliet,\r\ndaughter of the drochiere, electrically abstracted from _her_ window as\r\nif by the sudden application of a four-hundred-enraged-mother-power to\r\nher lofty chignon from behind, while the three Romeos, evidently all\r\nstrangers to each other, folded their tents like the Arab and silently\r\nstole away. [Illustration: ROMEO.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JULIET.]\r\n\r\nThe Leatherstonepaughs always suspected that no lordly race, from\r\nfather's father to son's son, had ever dwelt in their immense palace.\r\nThey suspected rather that it was, like many another mighty Roman pile,\r\nreared by plebeian gains to shelter noble Romans fair and proud whom\r\nFate confined to economical \"flats,\" and whose wounded pride could best\r\nbe poulticed by the word _palazzo_.\r\n\r\nHans Christian Andersen knew this palace well, and has described it as\r\nthe early home of his _Improvisatore_. In those days two fountains\r\ntinkled, one within, the other just outside, the dusky iron-barred\r\nbasement. One fountain, however, has ceased to flow, and now if a\r\npasser-by peeps in at the grated window, whence issue hot strong vapors\r\nand bursts of merry laughter, he will see a huge stone basin into whose\r\nfoaming contents one fountain drips, and over which a dozen washerwomen\r\nbend and pound with all their might and main in a bit of chiaroscuro\r\nthat reminds one of Correggio.\r\n\r\nOver this Correggio glimpse wide stone stairs lead past dungeon-like\r\ndoors up five flights to the skylighted roof. Each of these doors has a\r\ntiny opening through which gleams a watchful eye and comes the sound of\r\nthe inevitable \"_Chi è?_\" whenever the doorbell rings, as if each comer\r\nwere an armed marauder strayed down from the Middle Ages, who must be\r\nwell reconnoitred before the fortress-gates are unbarred.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE COURT OF THE LEATHERSTONEPAUGHS' PALACE.]\r\n\r\nIt was in the _ultimo piano_ that the Leatherstonepaughs pitched their\r\nlodge in a vast wilderness of colorful tiled roofs, moss-grown and\r\nlichen-laden, amid a forest of quaintly-shaped and smokeless chimneys.\r\nTheir floors, guiltless of rugs or carpets, were of earthen tiles and\r\nworn into hollows where the feet of the palace-dwellers passed oftenest\r\nto and fro. A multitude of undraped windows opened like doors upon stone\r\nbalconies, whither the inhabitants flew like a startled covey of birds\r\nevery time the king and queen drove by in the street below, and upon\r\nwhich they passed always from room to room. The outer balcony looks down\r\nupon the Piazza Barberini and its famous Spouting Triton, with an\r\nhorizon-line over the roofs broken by gloomy stone-pines and cypresses\r\nthat seem to have grown from the buried griefs of Rome's dead centuries.\r\nThe inner balcony overlooks the court, where through the wide windows of\r\nevery story, amid the potted plants and climbing vines that never take\r\non a shade of pallor in an Italian winter, and that adorn every Roman\r\nbalcony, one could see into the penetralia of a dozen Roman families and\r\nwrest thence the most vital secrets--even to how much _Romano_ Alfredo\r\ndrank at dinner or whether lemon-juice or sour wine gave piquancy to\r\nRosina's salad. Entirely unacquainted with these descendants of ancient\r\npatrician or pleb, the Leatherstonepaughs ventilated original and\r\nindividual theories concerning them, and gave them names of their own\r\nchoosing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A CASE OF NON-REMITTANCE.]\r\n\r\n\"Rameses the Great has quarrelled with the Sphinx and is flirting with\r\nthe Pyramid,\" whispered young Cain one day as some of the family,\r\nleaning over the iron railing, looked into the leafy, azure-domed vault\r\nbelow, and saw into the dining-room of a family whose mysteriousness of\r\nhabit and un-Italian blankness of face gave them a fanciful resemblance\r\nto the eternal riddles of the Orient.\r\n\r\nThe \"Pyramid,\" whose wide feet and tiny head gave her her triangular\r\ntitle, was evidently a teacher, for she so often carried exercise-books\r\nand dog-eared grammars in her hand. She chanced at that moment to glance\r\nupward. \"Lucia,\" she cried to the Sphinx, speaking with an Italian\r\naccent that she flattered herself was to the down-gazers an unknown\r\ntongue, \"do look up to the fifth _loggia_. If there isn't the Huge Bear,\r\nthe Middle-sized Bear and the Wee Bear looking as if they wanted to come\r\ndown and eat us up!\"\r\n\r\n\"Y' ain't fat 'nuf,\" yelled the Wee Bear before the elder Bruins had\r\ntime to squelch him.\r\n\r\nThe studio-salon of the Leatherstonepaughs amid the clouds and chimneys\r\nof the Eternal City was a chapter for the curious. It was as spacious as\r\na country meeting-house, as lofty as befits a palace. It was frescoed\r\nlike some of the modern pseudo-Gothic and pine cathedrals that adorn the\r\nvillage-greens of New England hamlets, and its _pot-pourri_ of artistic\r\nideas was rich in helmeted Minervas, vine-wreathed Bacchuses, winged\r\nApollos and nameless classic nymphs, all staring downward from the\r\nspandrels of pointed arches with quite as much at-homeness as Olympian\r\nheroes would feel amid the mystic shades of the Scandinavian Walhalla.\r\nThis room was magnificent with crimson upholstery, upon which rested a\r\nmultitude of scarlet-embroidered cushions that seemed to the\r\ncolor-loving eye like a dream of plum-pudding after a nightmare of\r\nmince-pie. Through this magnificence had drifted, while yet the\r\nLeatherstonepaughs saw Rome in all its idealizing mists, generations of\r\nartists. Sometimes these artists had had a sublime disdain of base\r\nlucre, and sometimes base lucre had had a sublime disdain of them. Some\r\nof the latter class--whose name is Legion--had marked their passage by\r\nbusts, statuettes and paintings that served to remind Signora Anina,\r\ntheir landlady, that promises of a remittance can be as fair and false\r\nas the song of the Sirens or the guile of the Loreley. Crusaders in\r\narmor brandished their lances there in evidence that Michael Angelo\r\nBivins never sent from Manhattan the bit of white paper to redeem them.\r\nAntignone--usually wearing a Leatherstonepaugh bonnet--mourned that\r\nPraxiteles Periwinkle faded out of the vistas of Rome to the banks of\r\nthe Thames without her. Dancing Floras seemed joyous that they had not\r\ngone wandering among the Theban Colossi with Zefferino, instead of\r\nstaying to pay for his Roman lodging; while the walls smiled, wept,\r\nsimpered, threatened and gloomed with Madonnas, Dolorosas, Beatrices,\r\nsprites, angels and fiends, the authors of whose being had long ago\r\ndrifted away on the ocean of poverty which sweeps about the world, and\r\nbeneath which sometimes the richest-freighted ships go down. In the\r\ntwenty years that Signora Anina has let her rooms to artists many such\r\ntragedies have written significant and dreary lines upon her walls.\r\n\r\nThat studio-salon was rich not alone in painting and sculpture. The\r\nwhatnot was a museum whither might come the Northern Goth and Southern\r\nVandal to learn what a Roman home can teach of the artistic taste that\r\nMatthew Arnold declares to be the natural heritage only of the nation\r\nwhich rocked the cradle of the Renaissance when its old Romanesque and\r\nByzantine parents died. That whatnot was covered with tiny china dogs\r\nand cats, such as we benighted American Goths buy for ten cents a dozen\r\nto fill up the crevices in Billy's and Bobby's Christmas stockings.\r\nFancy inkstands stood cheek by jowl with wire flower-baskets that were\r\nstuffed with crewel roses of such outrageous hues as would make the\r\nAngel of Color blaspheme. Cut-glass spoon-holders kept in countenance\r\nshining plated table-casters eternally and spotlessly divorced from the\r\npurpose of their being. There were gaudy china vases by the dozen and\r\nsimpering china shepherdesses by the score. There were plaster casts of\r\nthe whole of Signora Anina's family of nine children, from the elder\r\nfiery Achilles to the younger hysterical Niobe. There were\r\nperfume-bottles enough to start a coiffeur in business, and woolly lambs\r\nenough for a dozen pastoral poems or as many bucolic butchers. But the\r\npiano was piled high with Beethoven's sonatas and Chopin's delicious\r\ndream-music, while a deluge of French novels had evidently surged over\r\nthat palace of the Leatherstonepaughs.\r\n\r\nWhen the family took possession of their share of the palazzo a corner\r\nof this studio-salon was dedicated to a peculiar member of their family.\r\nFrom that corner she seldom moved save as she swept away in some such\r\nelegant costume as the others wore only upon gala-occasions, or in some\r\npicturesque or wildly-fantastic garb that would have lodged her in a\r\npoliceman's care had she ever been suffered to escape thus from the\r\npalace. All day long, day after day, she tarried in her corner mute and\r\nmotionless, eying all comers and goers with a haughty stare. Sometimes\r\nshe leaned there with rigid finger pressed upon her lip, like a statue\r\nof Silence; sometimes her hands were pressed pathetically to her breast,\r\nlike a Mater Dolorosa; sometimes both arms hung lax and limp by her\r\nside, like those of a heart-broken creature; and sometimes she wildly\r\nclutched empty air, like a Leatherstonepaugh enthusiastically inebriated\r\nor gone stark, staring, raving mad!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANTIGNONE.]\r\n\r\nYet never, never, never was Silentia Leatherstonepaugh known to break\r\nthat dreadful silence, even though honored guests spoke to her kindly,\r\nand although young Cain Leatherstonepaugh repeatedly reviled her as had\r\nshe been Abel's wife. One day came an old Spanish monk of whom Leah and\r\nRachel would learn the language of Castile. Silentia gloomed in her\r\ndusky corner unseen of the monk, who was left with her an instant alone.\r\nA few moments before, moved perhaps by a dawning comprehension of the\r\nunspeakable pathos of her fate, young Cain had given her a dagger. When,\r\ntwo minutes after the monk's arrival, Leah and Rachel entered the room,\r\na black sighing mass cowered in a corner of the sofa, while Silentia\r\nrose spectre-like in the dimness, the dagger pointed toward her heart.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SILENTIA LEATHERSTONEPAUGH.]\r\n\r\n\"Madonna mia!\" giggled the monk hysterically when his petticoats were\r\npulled decorously about him and he was set on his feet again, \"I thought\r\nI should be arrested for murder--_poverino mio_!\"\r\n\r\nAnother day came one of the Beelzebub girls--Lady Diavoletta--who wished\r\nto coax some of the Leatherstonepaughs to paint her a series of fans\r\nwith the torments of Dante's Inferno. When the doorbell rang, and while\r\nCain cried \"_Chi è?_\" at the peephole, Leah, who was just posing for\r\nRachel's barelegged gypsy, hastily pulled a long silk skirt from haughty\r\nbut unresisting Silentia and hurried it over her own head before Lady\r\nDiavoletta was admitted. The heiress of the Beelzebubs tarried but a\r\nmoment, then took her departure grimly, without hinting a word of her\r\npurpose. Said Lady Diavoletta afterward to the Cherubim sisters, \"Would\r\nyou believe it? I called one day upon those Leatherstonepaughs, and they\r\nnever even apologized for receiving me in a room where there was an\r\ninsane American just escaped from her keeper, _tray beang arrangée pore\r\ndoncy le cong cong_!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SILENTIA AS SHE APPEARED TO LADY DIAVOLETTA BEELZEBUB.]\r\n\r\nDismal and grim though the exterior of that palazzo was, needing but\r\ntowers and machicolated parapets to seem a fortress, or an encircling\r\nwall to seem a frowning monastery where cowled figures met each other\r\nonly to whisper sepulchrally, \"Brother, we must die,\" it was yet the\r\nscene of not a few laughable experiences. And perhaps even in this\r\nrespect it may not have differed so widely as one might think from\r\ncloistered shades of other days, when out of sad, earth-colored raiment\r\nand the habit of dismal speech human sentiment painted pictures while\r\nyet the fagots grew apace for their destruction as well as for the\r\nfuneral-pyre of their scolding and bellowing enemy, Savonarola. For\r\nwhere Fra Angelico, working from the life, could create a San Sebastian\r\nso instinct with earthly vitality and earthly bloom that pious\r\nFlorentine women could not say their prayers in peace in its presence,\r\nthere were three easels, each bearing a canvas, in different parts of\r\nthe room. Before each easel worked a Leatherstonepaugh, each clad with\r\nclassic simplicity in a long blue cotton garment, decorated with many\r\ncolors and smelling strongly of retouching varnish, that covered her\r\nfrom the white ruffle at her throat to the upper edge of her black\r\nalpaca flounce.\r\n\r\nThe room was silent, and, except for the deft action of brushes,\r\nmotionless. Only that from below was heard the musical splash of the\r\nBarberini Tritons, and that from the windows could be seen the sombre\r\npines of the Ludovisi gardens swaying in solemn rhythmic measure must\r\nhave been sometimes unbending from the dole and drear of mediæval\r\nasceticism into something very like human fun.\r\n\r\nOne day the Leatherstonepaughs were all at work in the immense studio.\r\nSilentia alone was idle, and, somewhat indecorously draped only in a bit\r\nof old tapestry, with dishevelled hair and lolling head, leaned against\r\nthe wall, apparently in the last stages of inebriety. There against the\r\nblue sky, all the world would have seemed petrified into the complete\r\npassiveness of sitting for its picture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: YOUNG CAIN INTERVIEWING SILENTIA.]\r\n\r\nMarietta was their model. She was posed in a nun's dress, pensive gray,\r\nwith virginal white bound primly across her brow. Marietta is a capital\r\nmodel, and her sad face and tender eyes were upturned with exactly the\r\ndesired expression to the grinning mask in the centre of the ceiling.\r\nSilentia kindly consented to pose for the cross to which the nun clung;\r\nthat is, she wobbled weakly into the place where the sacred emblem would\r\nhave been were this Nature and not Art, and where the cross would be in\r\nthe picture when completed. Marietta clung devoutly to Silentia's\r\nankles, and Silentia looked as cross as possible.\r\n\r\n\"How unusual to see one of Italia's children with a face like that!\"\r\nsaid a Leatherstonepaugh as she studied the nun's features. \"One would\r\nsay that she had really found peace only after some terrible suffering.\"\r\n\r\n\"She does not give me that impression,\" said another Leatherstonepaugh.\r\n\"Her contours are too round, her color too undimmed, ever to have\r\nweathered spiritual storms. She seems to me more like one of Giovanni\r\nBellini's Madonnas, those fair, fresh girl-mothers whom sorrow has never\r\nbreathed upon to blight a line or tint, and yet who seem to have a\r\nprophecy written upon their faces--not of the glory of the agony, but of\r\nthe lifelong sadness of a strange destiny. This girl has some mournful\r\nprescience perhaps. Let me talk with her by and by.\"\r\n\r\n\"Marietta,\" said a Leatherstonepaugh in the next repose, \"if you were\r\nnot obliged to be a model, what would you choose to be, of all things in\r\nthe world?\"\r\n\r\nThis was only an entering-wedge, intended by insidious degrees to pry\r\nopen the heart of the girl and learn the mystery of her Madonna-like\r\nsadness.\r\n\r\nMarietta looked up quickly: \"What would I be, signorina? Dio mio! but I\r\nwould wear shining clothes and ride in the Polytheama! Giacomo says I\r\nwas born for the circus. Will le signorine see?\"\r\n\r\nIn the twinkling of an eye, before the Leatherstonepaughs could breathe,\r\nthe pensive gray raiment was drawn up to the length of a ballet-skirt\r\nand the foot of the Madonna-faced nun was in the open mouth of one of\r\nLucca della Robbia's singing-boys that hung on the wall about five feet\r\nfrom the floor!\r\n\r\n\"Can any of the signorine do _that_?\" she crowed triumphantly. \"I can\r\nknock off a man's hat or black his eye with my foot.\"\r\n\r\nAll the Leatherstonepaughs groaned in doleful chorus, \"A-a-a-h-h!\"\r\n\r\nAnd it was not until young Cain, ostracised from the studio during the\r\nséance, whistled in through the keyhole sympathetic inquiries concerning\r\nthe only woe his little soul knew, \"Watty matter in yare? Ennybuddy dut\r\ne tummuck-ache?\" that they chorused with laughter at their\r\n\"Giovanni-Bellini Madonna.\"\r\n\r\nMARGARET BERTHA WRIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHELLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Shelley, the wondrous music of thy soul\r\n      Breathes in the cloud and in the skylark's song,\r\n      That float as an embodied dream along\r\n    The dewy lids of Morning. In the dole\r\n    That haunts the west wind, in the joyous roll\r\n      Of Arethusan fountains, or among\r\n      The wastes where Ozymandias the strong\r\n    Lies in colossal ruin, thy control\r\n      Speaks in the wedded rhyme. Thy spirit gave\r\n    A fragrance to all Nature, and a tone\r\n      To inexpressive Silence.

B. TABB.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPARADISE PLANTATION\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"THE SPLENDID SADDLE-HOSS.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Of course you will live at the hotel?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all. The idea of leaving one's work three times a day to dress\r\nfor meals!\"\r\n\r\n\"May I ask, then, where you _do_ propose to reside?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the cottage on the place, to be sure.\"\r\n\r\nThe Pessimist thrust his hands into his pockets and gave utterance to a\r\nlong, low whistle.\r\n\r\n\"You don't believe it? Come over with us and look at it, and let us tell\r\nyou our plans.\"\r\n\r\n\"That negro hut, Hope? You never can be in earnest?\"\r\n\r\n\"She is until she has seen it,\" said the Invalid, smiling. \"You had\r\nbetter go over with her: a sight of the place will be more effectual\r\nthan all your arguments.\"\r\n\r\n\"But she _has_ seen it,\" said Merry. \"Two years ago, when we were here\r\nand old Uncle Nat was so ill, we went over there.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I remember the house perfectly,\" added Hope--\"a charming long, low,\r\ndark room, with no windows and a great fireplace, and the most\r\nmagnificent live-oak overhanging the roof.\"\r\n\r\n\"How enchanting! Let us move in at once.\" The Invalid rose from his\r\nchair, and taking Merry's arm, the four descended the piazza-steps.\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" explained Hope as we walked slowly under the grand old\r\ntrees of the hotel park--\"of course the carpenter and the painter and\r\nthe glazier are to intervene, and Merry and I must make no end of\r\ncurtains and things. But it will be ever so much cheaper, when all is\r\ndone, than living at the hotel, besides being so much more cozy; and if\r\nwe are to farm, we really should be on the spot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Meantime, I shall retain my room at the hotel,\" said the Pessimist,\r\nletting down the bars.\r\n\r\n\"You are expected to do that,\" retorted Merry, disdaining the bars and\r\nclimbing over the fence. \"It will be quite as much as you deserve to be\r\npermitted to take your meals with us. But there! can you deny that that\r\nis beautiful?\"\r\n\r\nThe wide field in which we were walking terminated in a high bluff above\r\nthe St. John's. A belt of great forest trees permitted only occasional\r\nglimpses of the water on that side, but to the northward the ground\r\nsloped gradually down to one of the picturesque bays which so frequently\r\nindent the shores of the beautiful river. Huge live-oaks stood here and\r\nthere about the field, with soft gray Spanish moss swaying from their\r\ndark branches. Under the shadow of one more mighty than the rest stood\r\nthe cottage, or rather the two cottages, which formed the much-discussed\r\nresidence--two unpainted, windowless buildings, with not a perpendicular\r\nline in their whole superficial extent.\r\n\r\nThe Pessimist withdrew the stick which held the staple and threw open\r\nthe unshapely door. There were no steps, but a little friendly pushing\r\nand pulling brought even the Invalid within the room. There was a\r\nmoment's silence; then, from Hope, \"Oh, the magnificent chimney! Think\r\nof a fire of four-foot lightwood on a chilly evening!\"\r\n\r\n\"I should advise the use of the chimney as a sleeping-room: there seems\r\nto be none other,\" said the Pessimist.\r\n\r\n\"But we can curtain off this entire end of the room. How fortunate that\r\nit should be so large! Here will be our bedroom, and this corner shall\r\nbe for Merry. And when we have put one of those long, low Swiss windows\r\nin the east side, and another here to the south, you'll see how pleasant\r\nit will be.\"\r\n\r\n\"It appears to me,\" he remarked perversely, \"that windows will be a\r\nsuperfluous luxury. One can see out at a dozen places already; and as\r\nfor ventilation, there is plenty of that through the roof.\"\r\n\r\n\"The frame really is sound,\" said the Invalid, examining with a critical\r\neye.\r\n\r\n\"Of course it is,\" said Hope. \"Now let us go into the kitchen. If that\r\nis only half as good I shall be quite satisfied.\"\r\n\r\nThe kitchen-door, which was simply an old packing-box cover, with the\r\naddress outside by way of doorplate, was a veritable \"fat man's misery,\"\r\nbut as none of the party were particularly fat we all managed to squeeze\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\n\"Two rooms!\" exclaimed Hope. \"How enchanting! I had no idea that there\r\nwas more than one. What a nice little dining-room this will make! There\r\nis just room enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Us four and no more,'\" quoted Merry. \"But where will the handmaiden\r\nsleep?\"\r\n\r\n\"The kitchen is large,\" said the Pessimist, bowing his head to pass into\r\nthe next room: \"it will only be making one more curtain, Merry, and she\r\ncan have this corner.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is converted! he really is converted!\" cried Merry, clapping her\r\nhands. \"And now there is only papa, and then we can go to the sawmill to\r\norder lumber.\"\r\n\r\n\"And to the Cove to find a carpenter,\" added Hope. \"Papa can make up his\r\nmind in the boat.\"\r\n\r\nWe had visited Florida two years before, and, charmed with the climate,\r\nthe river, the oaks, the flowers, the sweet do-nothing life, we had\r\nfollowed the example of so many worthy Northerners and had bought an old\r\nplantation, intending to start an orange-grove. We had gone over all the\r\ncalculations which are so freely circulated in the Florida papers--so\r\nmany trees to the acre, so many oranges to the tree: the results were\r\nfairly dazzling. Even granting, with a lordly indifference to trifles\r\nworthy of incipient millionaires, that the trees should bear only\r\none-fifth of the computed number of oranges, and that they should bring\r\nbut one-third of the estimated price, still we should realize one\r\nthousand dollars per acre. And there are three hundred and sixty acres\r\nin our plantation. Ah! even the Pessimist drew a long breath.\r\n\r\nCircumstances had, however, prevented our taking immediate steps toward\r\nsecuring this colossal fortune. But now that it had become necessary for\r\nus to spend the winter in a warm climate, our golden projects were\r\nrevived. We would start a grove at once. It was not until we had been\r\nthree days at sea, southward bound, that Hope, after diligent study of\r\nan old Florida newspaper, picked up nobody knows where, became the\r\noriginator of the farming plan now in process of development.\r\n\r\n\"The cultivation of the crop becomes the cultivation of the grove,\" she\r\nsaid with the sublime assurance of utter ignorance, \"and thus we shall\r\nget our orange-grove at no cost whatever.\"\r\n\r\nShe was so much in earnest that the Invalid was actually convinced by\r\nher arguments, which, to do her justice, were not original, but were\r\nfilched from the enthusiastic journal before alluded to. It was decided\r\nthat we were to go to farming. It is true none of us knew anything\r\nabout the business except such waifs of experience as remained to the\r\nInvalid after thirty years' absence from grandpa's farm, where he used\r\nto spend the holidays. Holidays were in winter in those times, and his\r\nagricultural experience had consisted principally in cracking butternuts\r\nand riding to the wood-lot on the ox-sled. But this was of no\r\nconsequence, as Hope and Merry agreed, since there were plenty of books\r\non the subject, and, besides, there were the Florida newspapers!\r\n\r\n\"I warn you I wash my hands of the whole concern,\" the Pessimist had\r\nsaid. \"You'll never make farming pay.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because you won't.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why, because?\"\r\n\r\n\"The idea of women farming!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, well, if you come to that, I should just like to show you what\r\nwomen can do,\" cried Merry; and this unlucky remark of the Pessimist\r\nsettles the business. There is no longer any question about farming.\r\n\r\nNo one could deny that the house was pretty, and comfortable too, when\r\nat last the carpenter and painter had done their work, and the curtains\r\nand the easy-chairs and the bookshelves had taken their places, and the\r\ngreat fire of pine logs was lighted, and the mocking-bird's song\r\nstreamed in with the sunlight through the open door and between the\r\nfluttering leaves of the ivy-screen at the window. The piano was always\r\nopen in the evenings, with Merry or the Pessimist strumming on the keys\r\nor trying some of the lovely new songs; and Hope would be busy at her\r\ntable with farm-books and accounts; and the Invalid, in his easy-chair,\r\nwould be listening to the music and falling off to sleep and rousing\r\nhimself with a little clucking snore to pile more lightwood on the fire;\r\nand the mocking-bird in his covered cage would wake too and join lustily\r\nin the song, till Merry smothered him up in thicker coverings.\r\n\r\nThe first duty was evident. \"Give it a name, I beg,\" Merry had said the\r\nvery first evening in the new home; and the house immediately went into\r\ncommittee of the whole to decide upon one. Hope proposed Paradise\r\nPlantation; Merry suggested Fortune Grove; the Pessimist hinted that\r\nFolly Farm would be appropriate, but this proposition was ignominiously\r\nrejected; and the Invalid gave the casting-vote for Hope's selection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"I'SE DE SECTION, SAH.\"]\r\n\r\nThe hour for work having now arrived, the man was not slow in presenting\r\nhimself. \"I met an old fellow who used to be a sort of overseer on this\r\nvery plantation,\" the Invalid said. \"He says he has an excellent horse,\r\nand you will need one, Hope. I told him to come and see you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which? the man or the horse?\" asked Merry in a low voice.\r\n\r\n\"Both, apparently,\" answered the Pessimist in the same tone, \"for here\r\nthey come.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ole man Spafford,\" as he announced himself, was a darkey of ancient and\r\nvenerable mien, tall, gaunt and weatherbeaten. His steed was taller,\r\ngaunter and apparently twice as old--an interesting study for the\r\nosteologist if there be any such scientific person.\r\n\r\n\"He splendid saddle-hoss, missis,\" said the old man: \"good wuk-hoss\r\ntoo--bery fine hoss.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me he's rather thin,\" said Hope doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\"Dat kase we didn't make no corn dis year, de ole woman an' me, we was\r\nbofe so bad wid de misery in the leaders\" (rheumatism in the legs). \"But\r\nSancho won't stay pore ef you buys corn enough, missis. He powerful good\r\nhorse to eat.\"\r\n\r\nFurther conversation revealed the fact that old man Spafford was \"de\r\nchief man ob de chu'ch.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! a minister?\" asked the Invalid.\r\n\r\n\"No, sah, not azatly de preacher, sah, but I'se de nex' t'ing to dat.\"\r\n\r\n\"What may your office be, then, uncle?\" asked the Pessimist.\r\n\r\n\"I'se de section, sah,\" answered the old man solemnly, making a low bow.\r\n\r\n\"The sexton! So you ring the bell, do you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not azatly de bell, sah--we ain't got no bell--but I bangs on de\r\nbuzz-saw, sah.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does he mean?\" asked Merry.\r\n\r\nThe Pessimist shrugged his shoulders without answering, but the\r\n\"section\" hastened to explain: \"You see, missy, when dey pass roun' de\r\nhat to buy a bell dey didn't lift nigh enough; so dey jis' bought a\r\nbuzz-saw and hung it up in de chu'ch-house; an' I bangs on de buzz-saw,\r\nmissy.\"\r\n\r\nThe chief man of the church was found, upon closer acquaintance, to be\r\nthe subject of a profound conviction that he was the individual\r\npredestinated to superintend our farming interests. He was so well\r\npersuaded of this high calling that none of us dreamed of questioning\r\nit, and he was forthwith installed in the coveted office. At his\r\nsuggestion another man, Dryden by name, was engaged to assist old man\r\nSpafford and take care of Sancho, and a boy, called Solomon, to wait\r\nupon Dryden and do chores. A few day-laborers were also temporarily\r\nhired, the season being so far advanced and work pressing. The\r\ncarpenters were recalled, for there was a barn to build, and hen-coops\r\nand a pig-sty, not to speak of a fence. Hope and Merry flitted hither\r\nand thither armed with all sorts of impossible implements, which some\r\none was sure to want by the time they had worked five minutes with them.\r\nAs for the Pessimist, he confined himself to setting out orange trees,\r\nthe only legitimate business, he contended, on the place. This work,\r\nhowever, he performed vicariously, standing by and smoking while a negro\r\nset out the trees.\r\n\r\n\"My duties appear to be limited to paying the bills,\" remarked the\r\nInvalid, \"and I seem to be the only member of the family who cannot let\r\nout the job.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought the farm was to be self-supporting?\" said the Pessimist.\r\n\r\n\"Well, so it is: wait till the crops are raised,\" retorted Merry.\r\n\r\n\"Henderson says,\" observed Hope, meditatively, \"that there are six\r\nhundred dollars net profits to be obtained from one acre of cabbages.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you plant cabbages, then? In this seven-acre lot, for\r\ninstance?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that would be too many. Besides, I have planted all I could get. It\r\nis too late to sow the seed, but old man Spafford had some beautiful\r\nplants he let me have. He charged an extra price because they were so\r\nchoice, but I was glad to get the best: it is cheapest in the end. I got\r\nfive thousand of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"What sort are they?\" asked the Invalid.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know precisely. Spafford says he done lost the paper, and he\r\ndidn't rightly understand the name nohow, 'long o' not being able to\r\nread; but they were a drefful choice kind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, bother the name!\" said the Pessimist: \"who cares what it is? A\r\ncabbage is a cabbage, I presume. But what have you in this seven-acre\r\nlot?\"\r\n\r\n\"Those are peas. Dryden says that in North Carolina they realize four\r\nhundred dollars an acre from them--when they don't freeze.\"\r\n\r\nThe planting being now fairly over, we began to look about us for other\r\namusement.\r\n\r\n\"Better not ride old Sancho,\" remarked old man Spafford one day as he\r\nobserved the Pessimist putting a saddle on the ancient quadruped.\r\n\r\n\"Why not, uncle? You ride him yourself, and you said he was a very fine\r\nsaddle-horse.\"\r\n\r\n\"I rides he bareback. Good hoss for lady: better not put man's saddle\r\non,\" persisted the old man.\r\n\r\nThe Pessimist vaulted into the saddle by way of reply, calling out,\r\n\"Open the gate, Solomon,\" to the boy, who was going down the lane. But\r\nthe words were not spoken before Sancho, darting forward, overturned the\r\ndeliberate Solomon, leaped the gate and rushed out into the woods at a\r\ntremendous pace. The resounding beat of his hoofs and energetic cries of\r\n\"Whoa! whoa!\" from his rider were wafted back upon the breeze, gradually\r\ndying away in the distance, and then reviving again as the fiery steed\r\nreappeared at the same \"grand galop.\" The Pessimist was without a hat,\r\nand his countenance bore the marks of many a fray with the lower\r\nbranches of the trees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OVERTURNED SOLOMON.]\r\n\r\n\"Here, take your old beast!\" he said, throwing the bridle impatiently to\r\nSpafford. \"What sort of an animal do you call him?\"\r\n\r\nThe \"section\" approached with a grin of delight; \"He waw-hoss, sah.\r\nYoung missis rid he afo' the waw, an' he used to lady saddle; but ole\r\nmarsa rid he to de waw, an' whenebber he feel man saddle on he back he\r\nruns dat a way, kase he t'ink de Yankees a'ter him;\" and he exchanged a\r\nglance of intelligence with Sancho, who evidently enjoyed the joke.\r\n\r\nThe Invalid, who during the progress of our planting had spent much time\r\nin explorations among our \"Cracker\" neighbors, had made the discovery of\r\na most disreputable two-wheeled vehicle, which he had purchased and\r\nbrought home in triumph. Its wheels were of different sizes and\r\nprojected from the axle at most remarkable angles. One seat was\r\nconsiderably higher than the other, the cushions looked like so many\r\ndishevelled darkey heads, and the whole establishment had a most uncanny\r\nappearance. It was a perfect match, however, for Sancho, and that\r\nintelligent animal, waiving for the time his objection to having Yankees\r\nafter him, consented to be harnessed into the vehicle and to draw us\r\nslowly and majestically about in the pine woods. He never objected to\r\nstopping anywhere while we gathered flowers, and we always returned\r\nladen with treasures to deck our little home withal, making many a rare\r\nand beautiful new acquaintance among the floral riches of pine barren\r\nand hammock.\r\n\r\nMeantime, peas and cabbages and many a \"green\" besides grew and\r\nflourished under old man Spafford's fostering care. Crisp green lettuce\r\nand scarlet radishes already graced our daily board, and were doubly\r\nrelished from being, so to speak, the fruit of our own toil. Paradise\r\nPlantation became the admiration of all the darkey and Cracker farmers\r\nfor miles around, and it was with the greatest delight that Hope would\r\naccompany any chance visitor to the remotest corner of the farm,\r\nunfolding her projects and quoting Henderson to the open-mouthed\r\nadmiration of her interlocutor.\r\n\r\n\"Have you looked at the peas, lately, Hope?\" asked the Pessimist one\r\nlovely February morning.\r\n\r\n\"Not since yesterday: why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Come and see,\" was the reply; and we all repaired to the seven-acre lot\r\nin company. A woeful sight met our eyes--vines nipped off and trampled\r\ndown and general havoc and confusion in all the ranks.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, what is it?\" cried Merry in dismay.\r\n\r\n\"It's de rabbits, missy,\" replied old man Spafford, who was looking on\r\nwith great interest. \"Dey'll eat up ebery bit o' greens you got, give\r\n'em time enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"This must be stopped,\" said Hope firmly, recovering from her stupor of\r\nsurprise. \"I shall have a close fence put entirely around the place.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you've just got a new fence. It will cost awfully.\"\r\n\r\n\"No matter,\" replied Hope with great decision: \"it shall be done. The\r\nidea of being cheated out of all our profits by the rabbits!\"\r\n\r\n\"What makes them look so yellow?\" asked the Invalid as the family was\r\nlooking at the peas over the new close fence some evenings later.\r\n\r\n\"Don't they always do so when they blossom?\" asked Hope.\r\n\r\n\"How's that, Spafford?\" inquired the Pessimist.\r\n\r\n\"Dey ain't, not to say, jis' right,\" replied that functionary, shaking\r\nhis head.\r\n\r\n\"Why, what's the matter?\" asked Hope quickly.\r\n\r\n\"Groun' too pore, I 'spec', missis. Mighty pore piece, dis: lan' all\r\nwore out. Dat why dey sell so cheap.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"IT'S DE RABBITS, MISSY.\"]\r\n\r\n\"Then won't they bear?\" asked Merry in despairing accents.\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes,\" said Hope with determined courage. \"I had a quantity of\r\nfertilizers put on. Besides, I'll send for more. It isn't too late, I'm\r\nsure.--We'll use it for top-dressing, eh, Spafford?\"\r\n\r\n\"I declare, Hope, I had no idea you were such a farmer,\" said the\r\nInvalid with a pleasant smile.\r\n\r\n\"And then, besides, we don't depend upon the peas alone,\" continued\r\nHope, reflecting back the smile and speaking with quite her accustomed\r\ncheerfulness: \"there are the corn and the cabbages.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the potatoes and cucumbers,\" added Merry as we returned slowly to\r\nthe house by way of all the points of interest--the young orange trees,\r\nMerry's newly-transplanted wisteria and the pig-pen.\r\n\r\n\"I rather suspect that _there_ is our most profitable crop,\" said the\r\nInvalid as we seated ourselves upon the piazza which the Pessimist had\r\nlately built before the house. He was looking toward a tree which grew\r\nnot far distant, sheltered by two enormous oaks. Of fair size and\r\nperfect proportions, this tree was one mass of glossy, dark-green\r\nleaves, amid which innumerable golden fruit glimmered brightly in the\r\nsetting sunlight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PICKING PEAS.]\r\n\r\n\"Our one bearing tree,\" answered Hope. \"Yes, if we only had a thousand\r\nlike it we might give up farming.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall have them in time,\" said the Pessimist complacently, looking\r\nabroad upon the straight rows of tiny trees almost hidden by the growing\r\ncrops. \"Thanks to my perseverance--\"\r\n\r\n\"And Dryden's,\" interpolated Merry.\r\n\r\n\"There are a thousand four-year-old trees planted,\" continued the\r\nPessimist, not noticing the interruption. \"I wonder how many oranges\r\nthat tree has borne?\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose we have eaten some twenty a day from it for the last three\r\nmonths,\" said Merry.\r\n\r\n\"Hardly that,\" said the Invalid, \"but say fifteen hundred. And the tree\r\nlooks almost as full as ever.\"\r\n\r\n\"What if we should have them gathered and sold?\" suggested Hope--\"just\r\nto see what an orange tree is really worth. Spafford says that the fruit\r\nwill not be so good later. It will shrivel at last; and we never can eat\r\nall those oranges in any case.\"\r\n\r\nShipping the oranges was the pleasantest work we had yet done. There was\r\na certain fascination in handling the firm golden balls, in sorting and\r\narranging, in papering and packing; and there was real delight in\r\ndespatching the first shipment from the farm--the more, perhaps, as the\r\nprospect of other shipments began to dwindle. The peas, in spite of the\r\ntop-dressing, looked yellow and sickly. The cucumbers would not run, and\r\nmore blossoms fell off than seemed desirable. The Pessimist left off\r\nlaughing at the idea of farming, and spent a great deal of time walking\r\nabout the place, looking into things in general.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it almost time for those cabbages to begin to head?\" he asked one\r\nday on returning from a tour of inspection.\r\n\r\n\"Dryden says,\" observed Merry, \"that those are not cabbages at all: they\r\nare collards.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, under the sun, are collards?\" asked the Invalid.\r\n\r\n\"They are a coarse sort of cabbage: the colored people like them, but\r\nthey never head and they won't sell,\" said Hope, looking up from a\r\ntreatise on agricultural chemistry. \"If those should be collards!\"\r\n\r\nShe laid aside her book and went out to investigate. \"At any rate, they\r\nwill be good for the pigs,\" she remarked on returning. \"I shall have\r\nBehavior boil them in that great pot of hers and give them a mess every\r\nday. It will save corn.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Never say die!'\" cried the Pessimist. \"'Polly, put the kettle on,-'tle\r\non,-'tle on! Polly, put--'\"\r\n\r\nThe Invalid interposed with a remark. \"Southern peas are selling in New\r\nYork at eight dollars a bushel,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, those peas! Why won't they grow?\" sighed Merry.\r\n\r\nThe perverse things would not grow. Quotations went down to six dollars\r\nand to four, and still ours were not ready to ship. The Pessimist\r\nvisited the field more assiduously than ever; Merry looked despondent;\r\nonly Hope kept up her courage.\r\n\r\n\"Henderson says,\" she remarked, closing that well-thumbed volume, \"that\r\none shouldn't look for profits from the first year's farming. The\r\nprofits come the second year. Besides, I have learned one thing by this\r\nyear's experience. Things should not be expected to grow as fast in\r\nwinter--even a Southern winter--as in summer. Next year we will come\r\nearlier and plant earlier, and be ready for the first quotations.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a happy day for us all when at last the peas were ready to\r\nharvest. The seven-acre lot was dotted over with boys, girls and old\r\nwomen, laughing and joking as they picked. Dryden and old man Spafford\r\nhelped Hope and Merry with the packing, and the Pessimist flourished the\r\nmarking-brush with the greatest dexterity. The Invalid circulated\r\nbetween pickers and packers, watching the proceedings with profound\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of it all there came a shower. How it did rain! And it\r\nwould not leave off, or if it did leave off in the evening it began\r\nagain in the morning with a fidelity which we would fain have seen\r\nemulated by our help. One day's drenching always proved to be enough for\r\nthose worthies, and we had to scour the country in the pouring rain to\r\nbeat up recruits. Then the Charleston steamer went by in spite of most\r\nfrantic wavings of the signal-flag, and our peas were left upon the\r\nwharf, exposed to the fury of the elements.\r\n\r\nThey all got off at last in several detachments, and we had only to wait\r\nfor returns. The rain had ceased as soon as the peas were shipped, and\r\nin the warm, bright weather which followed we all luxuriated in company\r\nwith the frogs and the lizards. The fields and woods were full of\r\nflowers, the air was saturated with sweet odors and sunshine and songs\r\nof birds. A messenger of good cheer came to us also by the post in the\r\nshape of a cheque from the dealer to whom we had sent our oranges.\r\n\r\n\"Forty dollars from a single tree!\" said Hope exultantly, holding up the\r\nslip of paper. \"And that after we had eaten from it steadily for three\r\nmonths!\"\r\n\r\n\"The tree is an eighteen-year-old seedling, Spafford says,\" said the\r\nInvalid, looking at the document with interest. \"If our thousand do as\r\nwell in fourteen years, Hope, we may give up planting cabbages, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"The price will be down to nothing by that time,\" said the Pessimist,\r\nnot without a shade of excitement, which he endeavored to conceal, as he\r\nlooked at the cheque. \"Still, it can't go below a certain point, I\r\nsuppose. The newspapers are sounder on the orange question than on some\r\nothers, I fancy.\"\r\n\r\nOne would have thought that we had never seen a cheque for forty dollars\r\nbefore, so much did we rejoice over this one, and so many hopes of\r\nfuture emolument did we build upon it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PACKING.]\r\n\r\n\"What's the trouble with the cucumbers, Spafford?\" asked the Pessimist\r\nas we passed by them one evening on our way up from the little wharf\r\nwhere we had left our sailboat.\r\n\r\n\"T'ink it de sandemanders, sah. Dey done burrow under dat whole\r\ncucumber-patch--eat all the roots. Cucumbers can't grow widout roots,\r\nsah.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the Florida _Agriculturalist_ says that salamanders don't eat\r\nroots,\" said Hope: \"they only eat grubs and worms.\"\r\n\r\nSpafford shook his head without vouchsafing a reply.\r\n\r\n\"The grubs and worms probably ate the roots, and then the salamanders\r\nate them,\" observed the Pessimist. \"That is poetical justice, certainly.\r\nIf we could only eat the salamanders now, the retribution would be\r\ncomplete.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sandemanders ain't no 'count to eat,\" said old man Spafford. \"Dey ain't\r\nmany critters good to eat. De meat I likes best is wile-cat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wild-cat, uncle!\" exclaimed Merry.\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean to say you eat such things as that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, missy,\" replied the old man seriously, \"a wile-cat's 'most de\r\nproperest varmint going. Nebber eats not'ing but young pigs and birds\r\nand rabbits, and sich. Yankee folks likes chicken-meat, but 'tain't nigh\r\nso good.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if they eat rabbits I think better of them,\" said Hope; \"and here\r\ncomes Solomon with the mail-bag.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the letters which the Invalid turned out a yellow envelope was\r\nconspicuous. Hope seized it eagerly. \"From the market-man,\" she said.\r\n\"Now we'll see.\"\r\n\r\nShe tore it open. A ten-cent piece, a small currency note and a one-cent\r\nstamp dropped into her lap. She read the letter in silence, then handed\r\nit to her husband.\r\n\r\n\"Ha! ha! ha!\" laughed the Pessimist, reading it over his shoulder. \"This\r\nis the worst I _ever_ heard. 'Thirty-six crates arrived in worthless\r\ncondition; twelve crates at two dollars; fifty, at fifty cents;\r\nfreights, drayage, commissions;--balance, thirty-six cents.' Thirty-six\r\ncents; for a hundred bushels of peas! Oh, ye gods and little fishes!\"\r\n\r\nEven Hope was mute.\r\n\r\nMerry took the document. \"It was all because of the rain,\" she said.\r\n\"See! those last crates, that were picked dry, sold well enough. If all\r\nhad done as well as that we should have had our money back; and that's\r\nall we expected the first year.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's the corn, at any rate,\" said Hope, rousing herself. \"Dryden\r\nsays it's splendid, and no one else has any nearly as early. We shall\r\nhave the first of the market.\"\r\n\r\nThe corn was our first thought in the morning, and we walked out that\r\nway to console ourselves with the sight of its green and waving beauty,\r\nold Spafford being of the party. On the road we passed a colored woman,\r\nwho greeted us with the usual \"Howdy?\"\r\n\r\n\"How's all with you, Sister Lucindy?\" asked the \"section.\"\r\n\r\n\"All standin' up, thank God! I done come t'rough your cornfield, Uncle\r\nSpafford. De coons is to wuk dar.\"\r\n\r\nWe hastened on at this direful news.\r\n\r\n\"I declar'!\" said old Spafford as we reached the fence. \"So dey _is_\r\nbin' to wuk! Done tote off half a dozen bushel dis bery las' night.\r\nMought as well give it up, missis. Once _dey_ gits a taste ob it,\r\n_good-bye!_\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's the worst I _ever_ heard!\" exclaimed the Pessimist,\r\nresorting to his favorite formula in his dismay. \"Between the coons and\r\nthe commission-merchants your profits will vanish, Hope.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think I shall give it up so?\" asked Hope stoutly. \"We kept the\r\nrabbits out with a fence, and we can keep the coons out with something\r\nelse. It is only a few nights' watching and the corn will be fit for\r\nsale. Dryden and Solomon must come out with their dogs and guns and lie\r\nin wait.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bravo, Hope! Don't give up the ship,\" said the Invalid, smiling.\r\n\r\n\"Well, if she doesn't, neither will I,\" said the Pessimist. \"For the\r\nmatter of that, it will be first-rate sport, and I wonder I haven't\r\nthought of coon-hunting before. I'll come out and keep the boys company,\r\nand we'll see if we don't 'sarcumvent the rascals' yet.\"\r\n\r\nAnd we _did_ save the corn, and sell it too at a good price, the hotels\r\nin the neighborhood being glad to get possession of the rarity. Hope was\r\nradiant at the result of her determination: the Pessimist smiled a grim\r\napproval when she counted up and displayed her bank-notes and silver.\r\n\r\n\"A few years more of mistakes and losses, Hope, and you'll make quite a\r\nfarmer,\" he condescended to acknowledge. \"But do you think you have\r\nexhausted the catalogue of animal pests?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Hope, laughing. \"I never dared to tell you about the Irish\r\npotatoes. Something has eaten them all up: Uncle Spafford says it is\r\ngophers.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is a gopher?\" asked Merry. \"Is it any relation to the gryphon?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a sagacious variety of snapping-turtle,\" replied the Invalid,\r\n\"which walks about seeking what it may devour.\"\r\n\r\n\"And devours my potatoes,\" said Hope. \"But we have got the better of the\r\nrabbits and the coons, and I don't despair next year even of the gophers\r\nand salamanders.\"\r\n\r\n\"Even victory may be purchased too dearly,\" said the Pessimist.\r\n\r\n\"After all, the experiment has not been so expensive a one,\" said the\r\nInvalid, laying down the neatly-kept farm-ledger, which he had been\r\nexamining. \"The orange trees are a good investment--our one bearing tree\r\nhas proved that--and as for the money our farming experiment has cost\r\nus, we should have spent as much, I dare say, had we lived at the hotel,\r\nand not have been one half as comfortable.\"\r\n\r\n\"It _is_ a cozy little home,\" admitted the Pessimist, looking about the\r\npretty room, now thrown wide open to the early summer and with a huge\r\npot of creamy magnolia-blooms in the great chimney.\r\n\r\n\"It is the pleasantest winter I ever spent,\" said Merry\r\nenthusiastically.\r\n\r\n\"Except that dreadful evening when the account of the peas came,\" said\r\nHope, drawing a long breath. \"But I should like to try it again: I shall\r\nnever be quite satisfied till I have made peas and cucumbers\r\nprofitable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, all I have to say is, that you are destined to drag out an\r\nunsatisfied existence,\" said the Pessimist.\r\n\r\n\"I am not so sure of that,\" said the Invalid.\r\n\r\nAnd so we turned our faces northward, not without a lingering sorrow at\r\nleaving the home where we had spent so many sweet and sunny days.\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye, Paradise Plantation,\" said Merry as the little white house\r\nunder the live-oak receded from our view as we stood upon the steamer's\r\ndeck.\r\n\r\n\"It was not so inappropriately named,\" said the Invalid. \"Our life there\r\nhas surely been more nearly paradisiacal than any other we have known.\"\r\n\r\nAnd to this even the Pessimist assented.\r\n\r\nLOUISE SEYMOUR HOUGHTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHROUGH THE YELLOWSTONE PARK TO FORT CUSTER.\r\n\r\nCONCLUDING PAPER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was about 8.30 A. M. before the boat was found, some travellers\r\nhaving removed it from the place where Baronette had cachéd it. A half\r\nhour sufficed to wrap a tent-cover neatly around the bottom and to tack\r\nit fast on the thwarts. Then two oblongs of flat wood were nailed on ten\r\nfeet of pine-stems and called oars; and, so equipped, we were ready to\r\nstart.\r\n\r\nWe had driven or ridden hundreds of miles over a country familiar to any\r\none who chooses to read half a dozen books or reports; but, once across\r\nthe Yellowstone, we should enter a region of which little has been\r\nwritten since Lewis and Clarke wandered across the head-waters of the\r\nMissouri in 1805, and had their perils and adventures told anonymously\r\nby one who was to become famous for many noble qualities of mind and\r\nheart, for great accomplishments and unmerited misfortunes.[A]\r\n\r\nTwo or three of us sat on the bluff enjoying our after-breakfast pipes\r\nand watching the transport of our baggage. The gray beach at our feet\r\nstretched with irregular outline up the lake, and offered one prominent\r\ncape whence the boat started for its trips across the stream. By 10.30\r\nall the luggage was over, and then began the business of forcing\r\nreluctant mules and horses to swim two hundred yards of cold, swift\r\nstream. The bell-mare promptly declined to lead, and only swam out to\r\nreturn again to the shore. Then one or two soldiers stripped and forced\r\ntheir horses in, but in turn became scared, and gave it up amidst chaff\r\nand laughter. At last a line of men, armed with stones, drove the whole\r\nherd of seventy-five animals into the water with demoniac howls and a\r\nshower of missiles. Once in, they took it calmly enough, and, the brave\r\nlittle foal leading, soon reached the farther bank. One old war-horse of\r\nrecalcitrant views turned back, and had to be towed over.\r\n\r\nFinally, we ourselves crossed, and the judge and I, leaving the\r\nconfusion behind us, struck off into some open woods over an indistinct\r\ntrail. Very soon Major Gregg overtook us, and we went into camp about 4\r\nP. M. on a rising ground two miles from the lake, surrounded by woods\r\nand bits of grass-land. Here Captain G. and Mr. E. left us, going on\r\nwith Mr. Jump for a two days' hunt.\r\n\r\nNext day, at 7 A. M., we rode away over little prairies and across low\r\npine-clad hills, and saw to right and left tiny parks with their forest\r\nboundaries, until, after two miles, we came to Pelican Creek, a broad\r\ngrayish stream, having, notwithstanding its swift current, a look of\r\nbeing meant by Nature for stagnation. As we followed this\r\nunwholesome-looking water eastward we crossed some quaking, ill-smelling\r\nmorasses, and at last rode out on a spacious plain, with Mounts\r\nLangford, Doane and Stevenson far to the south-east, and Mount Sheridan\r\nalmost south-west of us. The first three are bold peaks, while about\r\nthem lie lesser hills numberless and nameless. The day seemed absolutely\r\nclear, yet the mountains were mere serrated silhouettes, dim with a\r\nsilvery haze, through which gleamed the whiter silver of snow in patches\r\nor filling the long ravines. Striking across the plain, we came upon a\r\ntent and the horses of Captain G. and Mr. E., who were away in the\r\nhills.\r\n\r\nThence we followed the Pelican Valley, which had broadened to a wide\r\nmeadowy plain, and about ten miles from the camp we began a rough ride\r\nup the lessening creek from the level. The valley was half a mile wide,\r\nnoisome with sulphur springs and steam-vents, with now and then a\r\ngayly-tinted hill-slope, colored like the cañon of the Yellowstone. Some\r\none seeing deer above us on the hills, Dr. T., Mr. K. and Houston rode\r\noff in pursuit. Presently came a dozen shots far above us, and the\r\nmajor, who had followed the hunters, sent his orderly back for\r\npack-mules to carry the two black-tailed deer they had killed. After a\r\nwild scramble through bogs we began to ascend a narrow valley with the\r\ncreek on our left. Jack Baronette \"guessed some timber might have fell\r\non that trail.\" Trail there was none in reality, only steep hillsides of\r\nsoft scoriæ, streaming sulphur-vents and a cat's cradle of tumbled dead\r\ntrees. Every few minutes the axes were ringing, and a way was cleared;\r\nthen another halt, and more axe-work, until we slipped and scrambled and\r\nstumbled on to a little better ground, to the comfort of man and beast.\r\n\r\nEighteen miles of this savage riding brought us to our next camp, where,\r\nas the shooting was said to be good and the cattle needed rest, it was\r\ndecided to remain two days. Our tents were pitched on a grassy knoll\r\noverlooking the main valley, which was bounded by hills of some three or\r\nfour hundred feet high, between which the Pelican ran slowly with bad\r\nwater and wormy trout, though there was no lack of wholesome springs on\r\nthe hill.\r\n\r\nMr. C. and Mr. T. went off with Jack, and Mr. K. with Jump, to camp out\r\nand hunt early. The night was clear, the thermometer down to 24°\r\nFahrenheit, and the ice thick on the pails when we rose. One of our\r\nparties came in with six deer: the captain and Mr. C. remained out. The\r\ncamp was pleasant enough to an idling observer like myself, but it was\r\nnot so agreeable to find the mountain-side, where Mr. T. and I were\r\nlooking for game, alive with mosquitos. I lit on a place where the bears\r\nhad been engaged in some rough-and-tumble games: the ground was strewed\r\nwith what the lad who was with us asserted to be bears' hair. It looked\r\nlike the wreck of a thousand chignons, and proved, on inspection, to be\r\na kind of tawny-colored moss!\r\n\r\nAll night long, at brief intervals, our mules were scared by a dull,\r\ndistant noise like a musket-shot. A soldier told me it was a mud volcano\r\nwhich he had seen the day we arrived. I then found it marked on Hayden's\r\nmap, but learned that it had not been seen by him, and was only so\r\nlocated on information received from hunters. On the morning of August\r\n1st I persuaded the major to walk over and look for the volcano. We\r\ncrossed the valley, and, guided by the frequent explosions, climbed the\r\nhills to the east, and, descending on the far side, came into a small\r\nvalley full of sluggish, ill-smelling rills, among which we found the\r\nremarkable crater, which, as it has not been hitherto examined by any\r\nsave hunters, I shall describe at some length.\r\n\r\nA gradual rising ground made up of soft sulphureous and calcareous earth\r\nwas crowned by a more abrupt rise some thirty-five feet high, composed\r\nof tough gray clay. This was pierced by a cone of regular form about\r\nthirty feet across at top and five feet at the bottom. On the west,\r\nabout one-third of the circumference was wanting from a point six feet\r\nabove the lowest level, thus enabling one to be at a distance or to\r\nstand close by, and yet see to the bottom of the pit. The ground all\r\naround and the shrubs and trees were dotted thick with flakes of dry\r\nmud, which gave, at a distance, a curious stippled look to the\r\nmud-spattered surfaces. As I stood watching the volcano I could see\r\nthrough the clouds of steam it steadily emitted that the bottom was full\r\nof dark gray clay mud, thicker than a good mush, and that, apparently,\r\nthere were two or more vents. The outbreak of imprisoned steam at\r\nintervals of a half minute or more threw the mud in small fig-like\r\nmasses from five to forty feet in air with a dull, booming sound,\r\nsometimes loud enough to be heard for miles through the awful stillness\r\nof these lonely hills. It is clear, from the fact of our finding these\r\nmud-patches at least one hundred yards from the crater, that at times\r\nmuch more violent explosions take place. The constant plastering of the\r\nslopes of the crater which these explosions cause tends to seal up its\r\nvent, but the greater explosions cleanse it at times, and all the while\r\nthe steam softens the masses on the sides, so that they slip back into\r\nthe boiling cauldron below. As one faces the slit in the cone there lies\r\nto the right a pool of creamy thin mud, white and yellow, feebly\r\nboiling. It is some thirty feet wide, and must be not more than twenty\r\nfeet from the crater: its level I guessed at sixteen feet above that of\r\nthe bottom of the crater.\r\n\r\nAfter an hour's observation near to the volcano I retired some fifty\r\nfeet, and, sheltering myself under a stunted pine, waited in the hope of\r\nseeing a greater outbreak. After an hour more the boiling lessened and\r\nthe frequent explosions ceased for perhaps fifteen minutes. Then of a\r\nsudden came a booming sound, followed by a hoarse noise, as the crater\r\nfilled with steam, out of which shot, some seventy-five feet in air,\r\nabout a cartload of mud. It fell over an area of fifty yards around the\r\ncrater in large or small masses, which flattened as they struck. As\r\nsoon as it ended I walked toward the crater. A moment later a second\r\nsquirt shot out sideways and fell in a line athwart the mud-pool near\r\nby, crossing the spot where I had been standing so long, and covering\r\nme, as I advanced, with rare patches of hot mud. Some change took place\r\nafter this in the character and consistency of the mud, and now, at\r\nintervals, the curious spectacle was afforded of rings of mud like the\r\nsmoke-rings cast by a cannon or engine-chimney. As they turned in air\r\nthey resembled at times the figure 8: once they assumed the form of a\r\nhuge irregular spiral some ten feet high, although usually the figures\r\nwere like long spikes, or, more rarely, thin formless leaves, and even\r\nlike bats or deformed birds.\r\n\r\nI walked back over the hills to camp, where we found Captain G. and the\r\ncommissary with the best of two deer they had shot. Later, Mr. C. and\r\nMr. K. came in with four elk, so that we were well supplied. Of these\r\nvarious meats the deer proved the best, the mountain-sheep the poorest.\r\nThe minimum of the night temperature was 34° Fahrenheit. At eighty-five\r\nhundred feet above tide the change at sundown was abrupt. Our camp-fires\r\nhad filled the little valley with smoke, and through it the moon rose\r\nred and sombre above the pine-clad outlines of the eastward hills.\r\n\r\nThe next day Mr. E. and I, who liked to break the journey by a walk,\r\nstarted early, and, following a clear trail, soon passed the mules. We\r\nleft Pelican Creek on our right, and crossed a low divide into a\r\ncooly,[B] the valley of Broad Creek: a second divide separated this from\r\nCañon Creek, both of which enter the Yellowstone below the falls.\r\n\r\nAfter some six miles afoot over grassy rolling plains and bits of wood,\r\nthe command overtook us, and, mounting, we followed the major for an\r\nhour or two through bogs and streams, where now and then down went a\r\nhorse and over went a trooper, or some one or two held back at a nasty\r\ncrossing until the major smiled a little viciously, when the unlucky\r\nones plunged in and got through or not as might chance.\r\n\r\nAbout twelve some of us held up to lunch, the train and escort passing\r\nus. We followed them soon through dense woods, and at last up a small\r\nbrook in a deep ravine among boulders big and small. At last we lost the\r\ntrail at the foot of a slope one thousand feet high of loose stones and\r\nearth, from the top of which a cry hailed us, and we saw that somehow\r\nthe command had got up. The ascent was very steep, but before we made it\r\na mule rolled down. As he was laden with fresh antelope and deer meat,\r\nthe scattering of the yet red joints as he fell made it look as if the\r\npoor beast had been torn limb from limb; but, as a packer remarked,\r\n\"Mules has got an all-fired lot of livin' in 'em;\" and the mule was\r\nrepacked and started up again. \"They jist falls to make yer mad,\r\nanyway,\" added the friendly biographer of the mule.\r\n\r\nThe sheer mountain-side above us was not to be tried mounted; so afoot,\r\nbridle in hand, we started up, pulling the horses after us. I had not\r\nthought it could be as hard work as it proved. There was a singular and\r\nunfeeling lack of intelligence in the fashion the horse had of differing\r\nwith his leader. When the man was well blown and stopped, the horse was\r\nsure to be on his heels, or if the man desired to move the horse had his\r\nown opinion and proved restive. At last, horses and men came out on a\r\nbit of level woodland opening into glades full of snow. We were\r\neighty-four hundred feet in air, on a spur of Amethyst or Specimen\r\nMountain. We had meant, having made eighteen miles, to camp somewhere on\r\nthis hill, but the demon who drives men to go a bit farther infested the\r\nmajor that day; so presently the bugle sounded, and we were in the\r\nsaddle again, and off for a delusive five-mile ride. As Mr. G. Chopper\r\nonce remarked, \"De mile-stones to hebben ain't set no furder apart dan\r\ndem in dis yere land;\" and I believed him ere that day was done.\r\n\r\nThe top of this great hill, which may be some ten thousand feet in\r\nheight, is large and irregular. Our trail lay over its south-eastern\r\nshoulder. After a little ride through the woods we came out abruptly on\r\na vast rolling plain sloping to the north-east, and broadening as it\r\nfell away from us until, with intervals of belts of wood, it ended in a\r\nmuch larger plain on a lower level, quite half a mile distant, and of\r\nperhaps one thousand acres. About us, in the coolies, the \"Indian\r\npaint-brush\" and numberless flowers quite strange to us all so tinted\r\nthe dried grasses of these little vales as to make the general hue seem\r\na lovely pink-gray. Below us, for a mile, rolled grassy slopes, now\r\ntawny from the summer's rainless heat, and set with thousands of\r\nbalsam-firs in groups, scattered as with the hand of unerring taste here\r\nand there over all the broad expanse. Many of them stood alone, slim,\r\ntall, gracious cones of green, feathered low, and surrounded by a\r\nbrighter green ring of small shoots extending from two to four feet\r\nbeyond where the lowest boughs, touching the earth, were reflected up\r\nfrom it again in graceful curves. On all sides long vistas, bounded by\r\nthese charming trees, stretched up into the higher spurs. Ever the same\r\nflowers, ever the same amazing look of centuries of cultivation, and the\r\nfeeling that it would be natural to come of a sudden on a gentleman's\r\nseat or basking cows, rather than upon the scared doe and dappled fawn\r\nwhich fled through the coverts near us. We had seen many of these parks,\r\nbut none like this one, nor any sight of plain and tree and flowers so\r\nutterly satisfying in its complete beauty. It wanted but a contrast,\r\nand, as we rode through and out of a line of firs, with a cry of wonder\r\nand simple admiration the rudest trooper pulled up his horse to gaze,\r\nand the most brutal mule-guard paused, with nothing in his heart but joy\r\nat the splendor of it.\r\n\r\nAt our feet the mountain fell away abruptly, pine-clad, and at its base\r\nthe broad plain of the East Branch of the Yellowstone wandered through a\r\nvast valley, beyond which, in a huge semicircle, rose a thousand\r\nnameless mountains, summit over summit, snow-flecked or snow-clad, in\r\nboundless fields--a grim, lonely, desolate horror of rugged, barren\r\npeaks, of dark gray for the most part, cleft by deep shadows, and right\r\nin face of us one superb slab of very pale gray buttressed limestone,\r\nperhaps a good thousand feet high. I thought it the most savage\r\nmountain-scenery I had ever beheld, while the almost feminine and tender\r\nbeauty of the parks which dotted these wild hills was something to bear\r\nin remembrance.\r\n\r\nBut the escort was moving, the mules crowding on behind our halted\r\ncolumn; so presently we were slipping, sliding, floundering down the\r\nhillside, now on steep slopes, which made one a bit nervous to ride\r\nalong; now waiting for the axemen to clear away the tangle of trees\r\ncrushed to earth by the burden of some year of excessive snow; now on\r\nthe horses, now off, through marsh and thicket. I ask myself if I could\r\nride that ride to-day: it seems to me as if I could not. One so fully\r\ngets rid of nerves in that clear, dry altitude and wholesome life that\r\nthe worst perils, with a little repetition, become as trifles, and no\r\none talks about things which at home would make a newspaper paragraph.\r\nYet I believe each of us confessed to some remnant of nervousness, some\r\nspecial dread. Riding an hour or two at night in a dense wood with no\r\ntrail is an experiment I advise any man to try who thinks he has no\r\nnerves. A good steep slope of a thousand feet of loose stones to cross\r\nis not much more exhilarating: nobody likes it.\r\n\r\nThe command was far ahead of two or three of us when we had our final\r\nsensation at a smart little torrent near the foot of the hill, a\r\ntributary of the main river. The horses dive, in a manner, into a cut\r\nmade dark by overgrowth of trees, then down a slippery bank, scuttle\r\nthrough wild waters surging to the cinche, over vast boulders and up the\r\nfarther bank, the stirrups striking the rocks to left or right, till\r\nhorse and man draw long breaths of relief, and we are out on the\r\nslightly-rolling valley of the East Yellowstone, and turn our heads away\r\nfrom Specimen Mountain toward Soda Butte.\r\n\r\nCaptain G. and I, who had fallen to the rear, rode leisurely northward\r\nathwart the open prairie on a clear trail, which twice crossed the\r\nshallow river, and, leaving the main valley, carried us up a narrowing\r\nvale on slightly rising ground. On either side and in front rose abrupt\r\nmountains some two thousand feet above the plain, and below the\r\nremarkable outline of Soda Butte marked the line of the Park boundary.\r\nNear by was a little corral where at some time herdsmen had settled to\r\ngive their cattle the use of the abundant grasses of these well-watered\r\nvalleys. When there are no Indian scares, the cattle herdsmen make\r\nimmense marches in summer, gradually concentrating their stock as the\r\nautumn comes on and returning to the shelter of some permanent ranche.\r\nThe very severity and steadiness of the winters are an advantage to\r\ncattle, which do not suffer so much from low temperature as from lack of\r\nfood. Farther south, the frequent thaws rot the dried grasses, which are\r\notherwise admirable fodder, but in Montana the steady cold is rather\r\npreservative, and the winds leave large parts of the plains so free from\r\nsnow that cattle readily provide themselves with food.\r\n\r\nThe cone of Soda Butte stands out on the open and level plain of the\r\nvalley, an isolated beehive-shaped mass eighty feet high, and presenting\r\na rough appearance of irregular courses of crumbled gray stone. It is a\r\nperfectly extinct geyser-cone, chiefly notable for its seeming isolation\r\nfrom other deposits of like nature, of which, however, the nearer hills\r\nshow some evidence. Close to the butte is a spring, pointed out to us by\r\nthe major's orderly, who had been left behind to secure our tasting its\r\ndelectable waters, which have immense credit as of tonic and digestive\r\nvalue. I do not distinctly recall all the nasty tastes which have\r\nafflicted my palate, but I am quite sure this was one of the vilest. It\r\nwas a combination of acid, sulphur and saline, like a diabolic julep of\r\nlucifer-matches, bad eggs, vinegar and magnesia. I presume its horrible\r\ntaste has secured it a reputation for being good when it is down. Close\r\nby it kindly Nature has placed a stream of clear, sweet water.\r\n\r\nA mile or so more brought us (August 3d) to camp, which was pitched at\r\nthe end of the valley of Soda Butte. We had had eleven hours in the\r\nsaddle, and had not ridden over twenty-eight or thirty miles. The train\r\ncame straggling in late, and left us time to sharpen our appetites and\r\nadmire the reach of grassy plain, the bold brown summits around us, and\r\nat our feet a grass-fringed lake of two or three acres. This pond is fed\r\nby a quick mountain-stream of a temperature of 45° Fahrenheit, and the\r\nonly outlet is nearly blocked up by a tangled network of weeds and\r\nfallen timber which prevents the fish from escaping. The bottom is thick\r\nwith long grasses, and food must be abundant in this curious little\r\npreserve. The shores slope, so that it is necessary to use a raft to get\r\nat the deep holes in the middle.\r\n\r\nAt breakfast next morning some one growled about the closeness of the\r\nnight air, when we were told, to our surprise, that the minimum\r\nthermometer marked 36° as the lowest night temperature. Certain it is,\r\nthe out-of-door-life changes one's feelings about what is cold and what\r\nis not. While we were discussing this a soldier brought in a five-pound\r\ntrout taken in the lake, which so excited the fishermen that presently\r\nthere was a raft builded, and the major and Mr. T., with bare feet, were\r\nloading their frail craft with huge trout, and, alas! securing for\r\nthemselves a painful attack of sunburn. I found all these large trout to\r\nhave fatty degeneration of the heart and liver, but no worms. They took\r\nthe fly well.\r\n\r\nAugust 5th, under clear skies as usual, we struck at once into a trail\r\nwhich for seventeen miles might have been a park bridle-path, a little\r\nsteeper, and in places a little boggy. Our way took us east by north\r\ninto Soda Butte Cañon, a mile wide below, and narrowing with a gradual\r\nrise, until at Miner's Camp it is quite closely bounded by high\r\nhillsides, the upper level of the trail being over eight thousand feet\r\nabove the sea. The ride through this irregular valley is very noble. For\r\na mile or two on our left rose a grand mass of basalt quite two thousand\r\nfeet in height, buttressed with bold outlying rocks and presenting very\r\nregular basaltic columns. A few miles farther the views grew yet more\r\ninteresting, because around us rose tall ragged gray or dark mountains,\r\nand among them gigantic forms of red, brown and yellow limestone rocks,\r\nas brilliant as the dolomites of the Southern Tyrol. These wild\r\ncontrasts of form and color were finest about ten miles up the cañon,\r\nwhere lies to the west a sombre, dark square mountain, crowned by what\r\nit needed little fancy to believe a castle in ruins, with central keep\r\nand far-reaching walls. On the brow of a precipice fifteen hundred feet\r\nabove us, at the end of the castle-wall, a gigantic figure in full armor\r\nseemed to stand on guard for ever. I watched it long as we rode round\r\nthe great base of the hill, and cannot recall any such striking\r\nsimulation elsewhere. My guides called it the \"Sentinel,\" but it haunted\r\nme somehow as of a familiar grace until suddenly I remembered the old\r\ntown of Innspruck and the Alte Kirche, and on guard around the tomb of\r\nthe great Kaiser the bronze statues of knight and dame, and, most\r\ncharming of all, the king of the Ostrogoths: that was he on the\r\nmountain-top.\r\n\r\nEverywhere on these hills the mining prospector has roamed, and on the\r\nsummit of the pass we found a group of cabins where certain claims have\r\nbeen \"staked out\" and much digging done. As yet, they are as profitable,\r\nby reason of remoteness, as may be the mines in the lunar mountains.\r\nWith careless glances at piles of ore which may or may not be valuable,\r\nwe rode on to camp, two miles beyond--not very comfortably, finding\r\nwater scarce, some rain falling and a great wealth of midges, such as we\r\ncall in upper Pennsylvania \"pungies,\" and needing a smudge for the\r\nrouting of them. The night was cold and dewy, and our sufferers were\r\nwretched with sunburn.\r\n\r\nThe doctor and George Houston here left us, and went on to a salt-lick\r\nfamous for game, but this proved a failure, some one having carelessly\r\nset fire to the tract. Indeed, in summer it is hard not to start these\r\nalmost endless fires, since a spark or a bit of pipe-cinder will at once\r\nset the grasses ablaze, to the destruction of hunting and the annoyance\r\nof all travellers, to whom a fire is something which suggests man, and\r\nthe presence of man needs, sad to say, an explanation. At 6 A. M.,\r\nAugust 6th, Captain G. and the lad Lee also went off on a side-trail\r\nafter game, and with lessened numbers we broke camp rather late, and\r\nrode into dense woods down a steady descent on a fair trail. The changes\r\nof vegetation were curious and sudden--from pines and firs to elders,\r\nstunted willows and sparse cottonwood bending over half-dry beds of\r\ntorrents, with vast boulders telling of the fierce fury of water which\r\nmust have undermined, then loosened and at last tumbled them from the\r\nhillsides. These streams are, in the early spring, impassable until a\r\ncold day and night check the thaw in the hills, and thus allow the\r\nimpatient traveller to ford.\r\n\r\nGradually, as we rode on, the hills to our left receded, and on our\r\nright the summits of Index and Pilot stood up and took the\r\nmorning--long, straggling volcanic masses of deep chocolate-brown, black\r\nas against the crystalline purity of cloudless blue skies, rising in the\r\nmiddle to vast rugged, irregular cones fourteen thousand feet above\r\ntide. From the bewildering desolateness of these savage peaks the eye\r\nwanders to the foot-hills, tree-clad with millions of pines, and lower\r\nyet to the wide valley of the West Branch of Clarke's Fork of the\r\nYellowstone, through which a great stream rushes; and then, beyond the\r\nriver, park over park with gracious boundaries of fir and pine, and over\r\nall black peak and snow-clad dome and slope, nameless, untrodden, an\r\ninfinite army of hills beyond hills. The startling combination of black\r\nvolcanic peaks with gray and tinted limestone still makes every mile of\r\nthe way strange and grand. In one place the dark rock-slopes end\r\nabruptly in a wall of white limestone one hundred to two hundred feet\r\nhigh and regular as ancient masonry. A little below was a second of\r\nthese singular dikes, which run for twenty miles or more.\r\n\r\nOn a rising ground where we halted to lunch a note was found stating\r\nthat Dr. T., failing to find game at the salt-lick, had gone on ahead.\r\nWhile lingering over our lunch in leisurely fashion, encircled by this\r\ngreat mass of snow and blackness, an orderly suddenly rode up to hasten\r\nus to camp, as Indian signs had been seen down the valley. In a moment\r\nwe were running our horses over a sage-plain, and were soon in camp,\r\nwhich was pitched on the West Branch in the widening valley. Dr. T. and\r\nGeorge Houston, it appeared, had seen a column of smoke four miles below\r\non a butte across the river. As the smoke was steady and did not spread,\r\nlike an accidental fire, it seemed wise to wait for the party. There\r\nbeing no news of Indians, and no probability of white travellers, it was\r\nwell to be cautious. It might be a hunters' or prospectors' camp, or a\r\nrallying-signal for scattered bands of Sioux, or a courier from Fort\r\nCuster. The doubt was unpleasant, and its effect visible in the men, two\r\nof whom already _saw_ Indians.\r\n\r\n\"See 'em?\" says Jack. \"Yes, they're like the Devil: you just doesn't see\r\n'em!\"\r\n\r\nWhile we pitched camp sentinels were thrown out, and two guides went off\r\nto investigate the cause of the fire. Houston came back in two hours,\r\nand relieved us by his statement that no trails led to the fire, and\r\nthat its probable cause was the lightning of the storm which had\r\novertaken us in camp the day before.\r\n\r\nAs the day waned the tints of the great mountains before us changed\r\ncuriously. Of a broken chocolate-brown at noon, as the sun set their\r\neastern fronts assumed a soft velvety look, while little purple clouds\r\nof haze settled in the hollows and rifts, fringing with tender grays the\r\nlong serrated ridges as they descended to the plain. As the sun went\r\ndown the single huge obelisk of Pilot Mountain seemed to be slowly\r\ngrowing upward out of the gathering shadows below. Presently, as the sun\r\nfell lower, the base of the mountain being swarthy with the growing\r\nnightfall, all of a sudden the upper half of the bleak cone yet in\r\nsunshine cast upward, athwart the blue sky, upon the moisture\r\nprecipitated by the falling temperature, a great dark, broadening shaft\r\nof shadow, keen-edged and sombre, and spreading far away into\r\nmeasureless space--a sight indescribably strange and solemn.\r\n\r\nThe next day's ride down Clarke's Fork still gave us morass and mud and\r\nbad trails, with the same wonderful views in the distance of snow-clad\r\nhills, and, nearer, brown peaks and gray, with endless limestone dikes.\r\nWe camped at twelve on Crandall's Creek, a mile from the main branch of\r\nClarke's Fork of the Yellowstone, and learned from the guides that no\r\nfish exist in these ample waters. The doubts I at first had were\r\nlessened after spending some hours in testing the matter. Strange as it\r\nmay seem, and inexplicable, I am disposed to think the guides are right.\r\nWe saw two \"cow-punchers,\" who claimed to be starving, and were\r\nquestioned with some scepticism. In fact, every stranger is looked after\r\nsharply with the ever-present fear of horse-thieves and of the\r\npossibility of being set afoot by a night-stampede of the stock. Our\r\nhunting-parties were still out when I started next morning at 8.30 to\r\nclimb a huge butte opposite our camp. I reached the top at about twelve,\r\nand found on the verge of a precipice some twenty-five hundred feet\r\nabove the vale a curious semicircle of stones--probably an Indian\r\noutlook made by the Nez Percés in their retreat. Sitting with my back\r\nagainst it, I looked around me. A doe and fawn leapt away, startled from\r\ntheir covert close by. Never, even in the Alps, have I so felt the sense\r\nof loneliness--never been so held awestruck by the silence of the hills,\r\nby the boundlessness of the space before me. No breath of air stirred,\r\nno bird or insect hovered near. Away to the north-west Pilot and Index\r\nrose stern and dark; across the valley, to the north, out of endless\r\nsnow-fields, the long regular red-and-yellow pyramid of Bear Tooth\r\nMountain glowed in vivid light with amazing purity of color; while\r\nbetween me and it the hills fell away, crossed by intersecting bands of\r\ndark firs, and between marvellous deceits of fertile farm-lands, hedges\r\nand orchards. Here and there on the plain tiny lakes lit up the sombre\r\ngrasses, and lower down the valley the waters of Clarke's Fork, now\r\ngreen, now white with foam, swept with sudden curve to the north-east,\r\nand were lost in the walls of its cañon like a scimitar half sheathed.\r\nOn my right, across the vast grass-slopes of this great valley, on a\r\ngradual hill-slope, rose the most remarkable of the lime dikes I have\r\nseen. It must enclose with its gigantic wall a space of nearly two miles\r\nin width, in the centre of which a wild confusion of tinted limestone\r\nstrata, disturbed by some old convulsion of Nature, resembles the huge\r\nruins of a great town.\r\n\r\nSoon after my return to camp, C. and the doctor came in with great\r\ntriumph, having slain four bears. I was not present on this occasion,\r\nbut I am inclined to fancy, as regards the doctor, that he verily\r\nbelieved the chief end and aim of existence for him was to kill bears,\r\nwhile C. had an enthusiasm of like nature, somewhat toned down.\r\n\r\nAfter a wild ride on cayooses across Clarke's Fork and on the glowing\r\npink side-slopes of Bear Tooth, and a camp in the hills, the ponies,\r\nwhich are always astray, were caught, and a game-trail followed among\r\nthe mountains. Suddenly, Houston, in a stage-whisper, exclaimed, \"We've\r\ngot him! He's an old buster, he is!\" He had seen a large gray\r\nbear--improperly called a grizzly--feeding a mile away in a long wide\r\ncooly. A rough, scrambling ride under cover of a spur, amid snow-drifts\r\nand tumbled trees, enabled the bear-hunters to tie up their ponies and\r\npush on afoot. If a man desire to lose confidence in his physical\r\npowers, let him try a good run with a Winchester rifle in hand nine\r\nthousand feet above tidewater. Rounding the edge of a hill and crossing\r\na snow-drift, they came in view of Bruin sixty yards away. He came\r\nstraight toward them against the wind, when there appeared on the left\r\nBruin No. 2, to which the doctor directed his attention. Both bears fell\r\nat the crack of the rifles, and with grunt and snort rolled to the foot\r\nof the cooly. Houston climbed a snowbank to reconnoitre, aware, as there\r\nwere no trees to climb, that an open cooly was no good place in which\r\nto face wounded bears. Away went the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"Let them alone, doctor,\" said Houston. \"Hold up! That valley's full of\r\nbears.\" For he had seen a third.\r\n\r\nThe doctor paused a moment, and then there was a rush down the slope. A\r\nsecond shot finished one bear, and then began a running fight of a mile,\r\nin which wind was of more value than courage. Finally, Bruin No. 2\r\nstopped. Leaving C. to end his days, the doctor and Houston pursued No.\r\n3. As the bear grew weak and they approached him, the doctor's\r\nexcitement and Houston's quite reasonable prudence rose together.\r\n\r\n\"Don't go down that cooly, doctor.\"\r\n\r\nThen a shot or two, a growl, and the doctor gasping, \"Do you think I\r\nleft my practice to let that bear die in his bed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, the place is full of bears,\" said George; and so on they went,\r\nnow a shot and now a growl, and then a hasty retreat of Bruin, until,\r\nutterly blown and in full sight of his prey, the unhappy doctor murmured\r\nin an exhausted voice, \"Give me one cool shot, George.\"\r\n\r\n\"Darn it!\" replied George, \"who's been warming your shots?\"\r\n\r\nAnd this one cool shot ended the fray. Returning, they found the judge\r\nhad driven his bear into a thicket, and, having probably taken out a _ne\r\nexeat_ or an injunction, or some such effective legal remedy against\r\nhim, awaited reinforcements. As George and the doctor arrived the bear\r\nmoved out into the open, and was killed by a final shot.\r\n\r\nMr. Jump informs us that one gets an awful price out of the Chinese for\r\nbear-galls; and it is the judge's opinion that at this supreme moment\r\nthe doctor would have taken a contract to supply all China with bile of\r\nBruin. I suspect our friend George has since told at many a camp-fire\r\nhow the doctor's spurs danced down the coolies, and how the judge\r\ncorralled his bear.\r\n\r\nWe broke camp August 10th at four, after a night of severe cold--27°\r\nFahrenheit--but perfectly dry and dewless. E. and I, as usual, pushed on\r\nahead across Lodge Pole Creek, and so down the valley of Clarke's Fork.\r\nAn increasing luxury of growth gave us, in wood or swamp, cottonwood,\r\nalder, willow, wild currants and myriads of snow-white lilies, and, in\r\npretty contrast, the red or pink paint-brush. Losing Pilot and Index as\r\nthe windings of the main valley hid them, and leaving them behind us, we\r\nbegan to see rocks of bright colors and more and more regular walls of\r\nsilvery gray stone. At last the widening valley broadened, and from it\r\ndiverged five valleys, like the fingers from a hand, each the bed of a\r\nstream. As we turned to the left and crossed the wildly-rolling hills,\r\nand forded Clarke's Fork to camp by Dead Indian Creek, the novelty and\r\nsplendor of this almost unequalled view grew and grew. As I close my\r\neyes it comes before me as at the call of an enchanter. From the main\r\nvalley the outlook is down five grass-clad valleys dotted with trees and\r\nhere and there flashing with the bright reflection from some hurrying\r\nstream. The mountains between rise from two to ten thousand feet, and\r\nare singular for the contrasts they present. The most distant to the\r\nright were black serrated battlements, looking as if their darkness were\r\nvacant spaces in the blue sky beyond. The next hill was a mass of gray\r\nlimestone, and again, on the left, rose a tall peak of ochreous yellows,\r\nsombre reds and grays. The hill above our camp was composed of red and\r\nyellow rocks, fading below to gray débris, bounded beneath by a band of\r\ngrasses, and below this another stratum of tinted rock; and so down to\r\nthe plain. The side-view of this group showed it to be wildly distorted,\r\nthe strata lying at every angle, coming out against the distant\r\nlava-peaks and the green slopes below them in a glory of tenderly-graded\r\ncolors.\r\n\r\nIt seems as if it should be easy to describe a landscape so peculiar,\r\nand yet I feel that I fail utterly to convey any sense of the emotions\r\nexcited by the splendid sweep of each valley, by the black fierceness of\r\nthe lava-peaks thrown up in Nature's mood of fury, by the great\r\n\"orchestra of colors\" of the limestone hills, and by a burning red\r\nsunset, filling the spaces between the hills with hazy, ruddy gold,\r\nand, when all was cold and dark, of a sudden flooding each grim\r\nlava-battlement with the dim mysterious pink flush of the afterglow,\r\nsuch as one may see at rare times in the Alps or the Tyrol. In crossing\r\nthe heads of these valleys, some day to be famous as one of the sights\r\nof the world, we forded Clarke's Fork, the major, Jack and I being\r\nahead. We came out on the far side upon a bit of strand, above and\r\naround which rose almost perpendicularly the eroded banks of the stream,\r\nsome fifteen feet high. While the guides broke down the bank to allow of\r\nour horses climbing it, I was struck with a wonderful bit of water. To\r\nmy right this tall bank was perforated by numerous holes, out of which\r\nflowed an immense volume of water. It bounded forth between the matted\r\nroots and welled up below from the sand, and, higher up the bank, had,\r\nwith its sweet moisture, bribed the ready mosses to build it numerous\r\ngreen basins, out of which also it poured in prodigal flood.\r\n\r\nAt this point, Dead Indian, we at first decided to await the looked-for\r\nscout, but on the next morning the major resolved to leave a note on a\r\ntripod for Mr. T., still out hunting, and to camp and wait on top of\r\nCañon Mountain above us. So we left the noisy creek and the broken\r\ntepees of Joseph and the Nez Percés, and the buffalo and deer-bones and\r\nthe rarer bones of men, and climbed some twenty-four hundred feet of the\r\nhill above us: then passed over a rolling plain, by ruddy gravel-hills\r\nand grasses gray- or pink-stemmed, to camp, on what Mr. Baronette called\r\nCañon Mountain, among scattered groups of trees having a quaint\r\nresemblance to an old apple-orchard. Here we held counsel as to whether\r\nwe should wait longer for the scout, push on rapidly to Custer, or\r\ncomplete our plans by turning southward to see the Black Cañon of the\r\nBig Horn River. Our doubt as to the steam-boats, which in the autumn are\r\nfew and far between, and our failing provisions, decided us to push on\r\nto the fort. Having got in all our parties, with ample supplies of game,\r\nwe started early next day to begin the descent from these delightful\r\nhills to the plains below. We rode twenty-eight miles, descending about\r\nthirty-seven hundred feet over boundless rolling, grass-clad foot-hills,\r\nbehind us, to the left, the long mountain-line bounding the rugged cañon\r\nof Clarke's Fork, and to the right a march of lessening hills, and all\r\nbefore us one awful vast gray, sad and silent plain, and in dimmest\r\ndistance again the gray summits about Pryor's Gap. The space before us\r\nwas a vast park, thick with cactus and sage-brush, lit up here and\r\nthere--but especially at the point where the cañon sets free the river\r\non to the plain--by brilliant masses of tinted rocks or clays in level\r\nstrata overlapping one another in bars of red, silver, pink, yellow and\r\ngray. With a certain sense of sadness we took a last look at these snowy\r\nsummits rising out of their green crowns of pine and fir, and, bidding\r\nadieu to the wholesome hills, rode on to the grim alkali plain with the\r\nthermometer at 92°.\r\n\r\nAnd now the days of bad water had come, each spring being the nastiest,\r\nand the stuff not consoling when once down, but making new and\r\nunquenchable thirst, and leaving a vile and constant taste of magnesia\r\nand chalk. And thus, over sombre prairies and across a wicked\r\nford--where, of course, the captain and T. got their baggage wet--and\r\npast bones of men on which were piled stones, and the man's breeches\r\nthrown over these for a shroud or as a remembrance of the shrivelled\r\nthing below being human, we followed the Nez Percés' trail, to camp at\r\nfour by the broad rattling waters of Clarke. Jack reported Indians near\r\nby--indeed saw them: guessed them to be Bannocks, as Crows would have\r\ncome in to beg. Sentinels were thrown out on the bluffs near us and the\r\nstock watched with redoubled care.\r\n\r\nI think every man who has camped much remembers, with a distinct\r\nvividness, the camp-fires. I recall happy hours by them in Maine and\r\nCanada and on the north shore of Lake Superior, and know, as every lover\r\nof the woods knows, how each wood has its character, its peculiar\r\nodors--even a language of its own. The burning pine has one speech, the\r\ngum tree another. One friend at least who was with me can recall our\r\ncamps in Maine,\r\n\r\n    Where fragrant hummed the moist swamp-spruce,\r\n      And tongues unknown the cedar spoke,\r\n    While half a century's silent growth\r\n      Went up in cheery flame and smoke.\r\n\r\nThe cottonwood burns with a rich, ruddy, abundant blaze and a faint\r\npleasant aroma. Not an unpicturesque scene, our camp-fire, with the\r\nrough figures stretched out on the grass and the captain marching his\r\nsolemn round with utterly unfatigable legs, Jack and George Houston\r\ngood-humoredly chaffing, and now and again a howl responsive to the\r\nanguish of a burnt boot. He who has lived a life and never known a\r\ncamp-fire is--Well, may he have that joy in the Happy Hunting-grounds!\r\n\r\nThe next day's ride was only interesting from the fact that we forded\r\nClarke's Fork five times in pretty wild places, where, of course,\r\nCaptain G. and the doctor again had their baggage soaked. The annoyance\r\nof this when, after ten hours in the saddle, you come to fill your\r\ntobacco-bag and find the precious treasure hopelessly wet, your\r\nwriting-paper in your brushes, the lovely photographs, a desolated\r\nfamily presented on your departure, brilliant with yellow mud--I pause:\r\nthere are inconceivable capacities for misery to be had out of a\r\ncomplete daily wetting of camp-traps. I don't think the captain ever\r\nquite got over this last day's calamity, and I doubt not he mourns over\r\nit to-day in England.\r\n\r\nThe ride of the next two days brought us again to rising ground, the\r\napproach to Pryor's Gap. On the 13th I rode on ahead with George\r\nHouston, and had an unsuccessful buffalo-hunt. We saw about forty head,\r\nbut by no device could we get near enough for effective shooting. I had,\r\nhowever, the luck to kill a buck antelope and two does. Rejoining the\r\ncommand in great triumph, I found Jump, to my amusement, waving over his\r\nhead a red cotton umbrella which some wandering Crow had dropped on the\r\ntrail. The umbrella being, from the Crow point of view, a highly-prized\r\nornament, it was not strange to find it on our trail. In an evil moment\r\nI asked Jump to hand it to me. As he did so it fell, open, over the nose\r\nof my cayoose. As to what happened I decline to explain: there have been\r\nmany calumnies concerning what Mr. Jump called \"that 'ere horse-show.\"\r\n\r\nOn this day we rode through the last range of considerable hills, past a\r\nvast rock which meant \"medicine\" of some kind for the Indian, as its\r\nclefts were dotted with sacrificial beads, arrows and bits of calico. A\r\nbrief scramble and a long descent carried us through Pryor's Gap, and\r\nout again on to boundless plains, thick with the fresh dung of the\r\nbuffaloes, which must have been here within two days and been hurried\r\nsouthward by Crow hunting-parties. This to our utter disgust, as we had\r\nbeen promised abundance of buffalo beyond Pryor's Gap.\r\n\r\nA thirty-mile march brought us to a poor camp by a marshy stream. Man\r\nand beast showed the effects of the alkaline waters, which seemed to me\r\nmore nasty every day. There is no doubt, however, that it is possible to\r\nbecome accustomed to their use, and no lands are more capable of\r\ncultivation than these if the water be sufficient for irrigation. The\r\ncamp was enlivened by an adventure of the major's, which revenged for us\r\nhis atrocious habit of rising at 3 A. M. and saying \"Now, gentlemen!\" as\r\nhe stood relentless at the tent-doors. C. and I had found a cañon near\r\nby about one hundred feet deep and having a good bathing stream. As we\r\nreturned toward it at evening we saw the gallant major standing\r\nbarelegged on the edge of the cañon, gesticulating wildly, his\r\nsaddle-bags and toilette matters far below beside the creek. Still\r\nsuffering with the sunburn, he had been cooling his feet in the water\r\npreparatory to a bath, when, lo! a bear standing on his hind legs eating\r\nberries at a distance of only about fifteen feet! The major promptly\r\navailed himself of the shelter offered by the bank of the stream; but\r\nonce there, how was he to escape unseen? The water was cold, the bear\r\nbig, the major shoeless. Perhaps a bark simulative of a courageous dog\r\nmight induce the bear to leave. No doubt, under such inspirations, it\r\nwas well done. The bear, amazed at the resources of the army,\r\nfled--alas! not pursued by the happy major, who escaped up the\r\ncañon-wall, leaving his baggage to a generous foe, which took no\r\nadvantage of comb or toothbrush. How the whole outfit turned out to hunt\r\nthat bear, and how he was never found, I have not space to tell more\r\nfully.\r\n\r\nAll of twelve hours the next day we rode on under a blinding sunlight, a\r\ncloudless sky, over dreary, rolling, dusty plains, where the only relief\r\nfrom dead grasses was the gray sage-brush and cactus, from the shelter\r\nof which, now and again, a warning rattle arose or a more timid snake\r\nfled swiftly through the dry grasses. Tinted cones of red and brown\r\nclays or toadstool forms of eroded sandstone added to the strange\r\ndesolateness of the view; so that no sorrow was felt when, after forty\r\nmiles of it, we came upon a picturesque band of Crows with two chiefs,\r\nRaw Hide and Tin Belly.\r\n\r\nIt was an amazing sight to fresh eyes--the clever ponies,\r\nthese bold-featured, bareheaded, copper-tinted fellows with\r\nbead-decked leggins, gay shirts or none, and their rifles slung in\r\nbrilliantly-decorated gun-covers across the saddle-bows. We rode down\r\nthe bluffs with them to the flat valley of Beauvais Creek, where a few\r\nlodges were camped with the horses, twelve hundred or more, in a grove\r\nof lordly cottonwood--a wild and picturesque sight. Tawny squaws\r\nsurrounded us in crowds, begging. A match, a cartridge, anything but a\r\nquill toothpick, was received with enthusiasm. I rode ahead to the ford\r\nof the Beauvais Creek, and met the squaws driving in the cayooses.\r\nAltogether, it was much like a loosely-organized circus. Our own camp\r\nbeing set, we took our baths tranquilly, watched by the squaws seated\r\nlike men on their ponies. One of them kindly accepted a button and my\r\nwornout undershirt.\r\n\r\nThe cottonwood tree reigns supreme throughout this country wherever\r\nthere is moisture, and marks with its varied shades of green the\r\nsinuous line of every water-course. Despised even here as soft and\r\neasily rotted, \"warping inside out in a week,\" it is valuable as almost\r\nthe sole resource for fuel and timber, and as making up in speed of\r\ngrowth for a too ready rate of decay. Four or five years' growth renders\r\nit available for rails, and I should think it must equal the eucalyptus\r\nfor draining moist lands. Many a pretty face is the more admired for its\r\nowner's wealth, and were the now-despised cottonwood of greater\r\nmarket-value it could not, I think, have escaped a reputation for\r\nbeauty. A cottonwood grove of tall trees ten to eighteen feet in\r\ndiameter, set twenty to forty feet apart, with dark-green shining leaves\r\nspreading high in air over a sod absolutely free of underbrush, struck\r\nsuch of us as had no Western prejudices as altogether a noble sight.\r\nBetween Forts Custer and Keogh the cottonwoods are still finer, and what\r\na mocking-bird is among birds are these among trees--now like the apple\r\ntree, now like the olive, now resembling the cork or the red-oak or the\r\nLombardy poplar, and sometimes quaintly deformed so as to exhibit\r\ngrotesque shapes,--all as if to show what one tree can do in the way of\r\nmimicking its fellows.\r\n\r\nTo our delight, General Sheridan's old war-scout, Mr. Campbell, rode in\r\nwith letters at dusk, and we had the happiness to learn that our long\r\nabsence had made ill news for none of us. By six next day we were up and\r\naway to see the great Crow camp, which we reached by crossing a long\r\nford of the swift Big Horn River. There were one hundred and twenty\r\nlodges, about one thousand Crows, about two thousand dogs and as many\r\nponies. I think it was the commissary who dared to say that every dog\r\ncould not have his day among the Crows, as there would not be enough\r\ndays to go round; but surely never on earth was such a canine chorus. It\r\ngave one a respect for Crow nerves. Let me add, as a Yankee, my\r\nveneration for the Crow as a bargainer, and you will have the most\r\nsalient ideas I carried away from this medley of dogs, horses, sullen,\r\nlounging braves with pipes, naked children warmly clad with dirt,\r\nhideous squaws, skin lodges, medicine-staffs gay with bead and feathers,\r\nand stenches for the describing of which civilized language fails.\r\n\r\nCrossing a branch of the Big Horn, we rode away again over these\r\ninterminable, lonely grass-plains; past the reaping-machines and the\r\nvast wagons, with a dozen pairs of oxen to each, sent out to gather\r\nforage for the winter use of the fort; past dried-up streams,\r\nwhitewashed with snowy alkaline deposits, cheating the eye at a distance\r\nwith mockery of foaming water. Still, mile on mile, across rolling\r\nlands, with brief pause at the river to water horses, scaring the gay\r\nlittle prairie-dogs and laughing at the swift scuttle away of\r\njack-rabbits, until by noon the long lines of Custer came into sight.\r\n\r\nThese three days of sudden descent from high levels to the terrible\r\nmonotony of the thirsty plains, without shade, with the thermometer\r\nstill in the nineties, began to show curiously in the morale of the\r\noutfit. The major got up earlier and rode farther: our English captain\r\nwalked more and more around the camp-fire. On one day the coffee gave\r\nout, and on the next the sugar, and everything except the commissary's\r\nunfailing good-humor, which was, unluckily, not edible. Mr. T. rode in\r\nsilence beside the judge, grimly calculating how soon he could get a\r\nrailroad over these plains. Even the doctor fell away in the \"talk\"\r\nline. Says Mr. Jump: \"These 'ere plains ain't as social as they might\r\nbe.\" Some one is responsible for the following brief effort to evolve in\r\nverse the lugubrious elements of a ride over alkali plains with failing\r\nprovender, weary horses, desiccating heat and quenchless thirst:\r\n\r\n    Silent and weary and sun-baked, we rode o'er the alkaline grass-plains,\r\n    Into and out of the coolies and through the gray green of the sage-brush--\r\n    All the long line of the horses, with jingle of spur and of bridle,\r\n    All the brown line of the mule-train, tired and foot-sore and straggling;\r\n    Nothing to right and to left, nothing before and behind us,\r\n    Save the dry yellowing grass, and afar on the hazy horizon,\r\n    Sullen, and grim, and gray, sunburnt, monotonous sand-heaps.\r\n    So we rode, sombre and listless, day after day, while the distance\r\n    Grew as we rode, till the eyeballs ached with the terrible sameness.\r\n\r\nBy this time the command was straggling in a long broken line, all eyes\r\nset on the fort, where, about 1.30, we dismounted from our six hundred\r\nmiles in the saddle to find in the officers' club-room a hearty welcome\r\nand the never-to-be-forgotten sensation of a schooner of iced Milwaukee\r\nbeer. From Fort Custer we rode a hundred and thirty miles in ambulances\r\nto Fort Keogh. This portion of our journey took us over the line to be\r\nfollowed by the Northern Pacific Railroad, and gave us a good idea of\r\nthe wealthy grass-lands, capable of easy irrigation, bordering the\r\nproposed line of rail. The river is navigable to Custer until the middle\r\nof September, and in wet seasons still later. Already, much of the best\r\nland is taken up, and we were able to buy chickens if we could shoot\r\nthem, and eggs and potatoes, the latter the best I have seen in any\r\ncountry. The river is marked by ample groves of superb cottonwoods and\r\nby immense thickets of the wild prairie-rose and moss-rose, while the\r\nshores are endlessly interesting and curious, especially the left bank,\r\non account of the singular forms of the mud and sandstone hills, along\r\nwhich, in places, lie for miles black level strata of lignite. At Fort\r\nKeogh we took a steamer to Bismarck, whence we travelled by rail on the\r\nNorthern Pacific road, reaching home September 9th. We had journeyed\r\nsixty-five hundred miles--on horses, six hundred; by ambulances, four\r\nhundred; by boat, six hundred and seventy-five.\r\n\r\n\r\nS. WEIR MITCHELL, M. D.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] Nicholas Biddle.\r\n\r\n[B] A little valley--probably from the French _coulisse_, a narrow\r\nchannel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADAM AND EVE.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nAunt Hepzibah's house stood well up the hill, far enough away from the\r\nvillage to escape the hubbub and confusion which during the removal of\r\nany considerable store of spirit were most certain to prevail.\r\n\r\nHidden away in the recesses of a tortuous valley, amid hills whose steep\r\nsides bristled with tier after tier of bare, broken rocks, to reach or\r\nto leave Polperro by any other mode than on foot was a task of\r\nconsiderable difficulty. Wagons were unknown, carts not available, and\r\nit was only at the risk of his rider's life and limbs that any horse\r\nventured along the perilous descents and ascents of the old Talland\r\nroad. Out of these obstacles, therefore, arose the necessity for a\r\nnumber of men who could manage the drays, dorsals and crooks which were\r\nthe more common and favored modes of conveyance. With the natural love\r\nof a little excitement, combined with the desire to do as you would be\r\ndone by, it was only thought neighborly to lend a hand at whatever might\r\nbe going on; and the general result of this sociability was that half\r\nthe place might be found congregated about the house, assisting to the\r\nbest of their ability to impede all progress and successfully turn any\r\nattempt at work into confusion and disorder.\r\n\r\nTo add to this tumult, a keg of spirits was kept on tap, to which all\r\ncomers were made free, so that the crowd grew first noisy and\r\ngood-tempered, then riotously merry and quarrelsomely drunk, until\r\noccasions had been known when a general fight had ensued, the kegs had\r\ngot burst open and upset, the men who were hired to deliver them lay\r\nmaddened or helpless in the street, while the spirit for which liberty\r\nand life had been risked flowed into the gutters like so much water.\r\n\r\nIn vain had Adam, to whom these scenes afforded nothing but anger and\r\ndisgust, used all his endeavors to persuade his fellow-workers to give\r\nup running the vessel ashore with the cargo in her. The Polperro men,\r\nexcept under necessity, turned a deaf ear to his entreaties, and in many\r\ncases preferred risking a seizure to foregoing the fool-hardy\r\nrecklessness of openly defying the arm of the law. The plan which Adam\r\nwould have seen universally adopted here, as it was in most of the other\r\nplaces round the coast, was that of dropping the kegs, slung on a rope,\r\ninto the sea, and (securing them by an anchor) leaving them there until\r\nsome convenient season, when, certain of not being disturbed, they were\r\nlanded, and either removed to a more distant hiding-place or conveyed at\r\nonce to their final destination. But all this involved immediate trouble\r\nand delay, and the men, who without a complaint or murmur would endure\r\nweeks of absence from their homes, the moment those homes came in sight\r\ngrew irritable under control and impatient of all authority.\r\n\r\nWith a spirit of independence which verged on rebellion, with an\r\nuncertain temperament in which good and bad lay jostled together so\r\nhaphazard that to calculate which at any given moment might come\r\nuppermost was an impossibility, these sons of the sea were hard to lead\r\nand impossible to drive. Obstinate, credulous, superstitious, they\r\nlooked askant on innovation and hated change, fearing lest it should\r\nturn away the luck which they vaunted in the face of discretion, making\r\nit their boast that so many years had gone by since any mischance had\r\novertaken the Polperro folk that they could afford to laugh at the\r\nsoldiers before their faces and snap their fingers at the cruisers\r\nbehind their backs.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances it was not to be supposed that Adam's\r\narguments proved very effective: no proposition he made was ever\r\nfavorably received, and this one was more than usually unpopular. So, in\r\nspite of his prejudice against a rule which necessitated the sequence\r\nof riot and disorder, he had been forced to give in, and to content\r\nhimself by using his authority to control violence and stem as much as\r\npossible the tide of excess. It was no small comfort to him that Eve was\r\nabsent, and the knowledge served to smooth his temper and keep down his\r\nirritability. Besides which, his spirits had risen to no common height,\r\na frequent result of the reaction which sets in after great emotion,\r\nalthough Adam placed his happy mood to the credit of Eve's kind words\r\nand soft glances.\r\n\r\nIt was late in the afternoon before the kegs were all got out and safely\r\ncleared off; but at length the last man took his departure, the visitors\r\nbegan to disperse, Uncle Zebedee and Jerrem disappeared with them, and\r\nthe house was left to the undisturbed possession of Joan and Adam.\r\n\r\n\"I shall bring Eve back when I come,\" Adam said, reappearing from the\r\nsmartening up he had been giving to himself.\r\n\r\n\"All right!\" replied Joan, but in such a weary voice that Adam's heart\r\nsmote him for leaving her sitting there alone, and with a great effort\r\nat self-sacrifice he said, \"Would you like to go too?\"\r\n\r\n\"Iss, if I could go two p'r'aps I should,\" retorted Joan, \"but as I'm\r\nonly one p'r'aps I might find myself one in the way. There, go along\r\nwith 'ee, do!\" she added, seeing him still hesitate. \"You knaw if\r\nthere'd bin any chance o' my goin' you wouldn't ha' axed me.\"\r\n\r\nA little huffed by this home-thrust, Adam waited for nothing more, but,\r\nturning away, he closed the door after him and set off at a brisk pace\r\nup the Lansallos road, toward Aunt Hepzibah's house.\r\n\r\nThe light had now all but faded out, and over everything seaward a\r\ncloudy film of mist hung thick and low; but this would soon lift up and\r\nbe blown away, leaving the night clear and the sky bright with the\r\nglitter of a myriad stars, beneath whose twinkling light Adam would tell\r\nhis tale of love and hear the sweet reply; and at the thought a thousand\r\nhopes leaped into life and made his pulses quicken and his nerves\r\nthrill. Strive as he might, arrived at Aunt Hepzibah's he could neither\r\nenter upon nor join in any general conversation; and so marked was his\r\nsilence and embarrassed his manner that the assembled party came to the\r\ncharitable conclusion that something had gone wrong in the adjustment of\r\nhis liquor; and knowing it was ticklish work to meddle with a man who\r\nwith a glass beyond had fallen a drop short, they made no opposition to\r\nEve's speedy preparations for immediate departure.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Eve,\" Adam exclaimed, giving vent to deep-drawn sighs of relief as,\r\nhaving turned from the farm-gate, they were out of sight and hearing of\r\nthe house, \"I hope you're not vexed with me for seeming such a fool as\r\nI've been feeling there. I have been so longing for the time to come\r\nwhen I could speak to you that for thinking of it I couldn't talk about\r\nthe things they asked me of.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, whatever can you have to say of so much importance?\" stammered\r\nEve, trying to speak as if she was unconscious of the subject he was\r\nabout to broach; and this from no coquetry, but because of an\r\nembarrassment so allied to that which Adam felt that if he could have\r\nlooked into her heart he would have seen his answer in its tumultuous\r\nbeating.\r\n\r\n\"I think you know,\" said Adam softly; and as he spoke he stooped to\r\ncatch a glimpse of her averted face. \"It's only what I'd on my lips to\r\nsay last night, only the door was opened before I'd time to get the\r\nwords out, and afterward you wouldn't so much as give me a look,\r\nalthough,\" he added reproachfully, \"you sat up ever so long after I was\r\ngone, and only ran away when you thought that I was coming.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed I didn't do that,\" said Eve earnestly: \"that was Joan whom\r\nyou heard. I went up stairs almost the minute after you left.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that really true?\" exclaimed Adam, seizing both her hands and\r\nholding them tight within his own. \"Eve, you don't know what I suffered,\r\nthinking you were caught by Jerrem's talk and didn't care whether I felt\r\nhurt or pleased. I lay awake most of the night, thinking whether it\r\ncould ever be that you could care for me as by some magic you've made\r\nme care for you. I fancied--\"\r\n\r\nBut here a rustle in the hedge made them both start. Adam turned quickly\r\nround, but nothing was to be discovered. \"'Twas, most-like, nothing but\r\na stoat or a rabbit,\" he said, vexed at the interruption: \"still, 'tis\r\nall but certain there'll be somebody upon the road. Would you mind\r\ncrossing over to the cliff? 'Tis only a little bit down the other side.\"\r\n\r\nEve raised no objection, and, turning, they picked their way along the\r\nfield, got over the gate and down through the tangle of gorse and brier\r\nto the path which ran along the Lansallos side of the cliff. Every step\r\nof the way was familiar to Adam, and he so guided Eve as to bring her\r\ndown to a rough bit of rock which projected out and formed a seat on a\r\nlittle flat of ground overhanging a deep gully.\r\n\r\n\"There!\" he said, in a tone of satisfaction, \"this isn't so bad, is it?\r\nYou won't feel cold here, shall you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not a bit,\" said Eve.\r\n\r\nThen there was a pause, which Eve broke by first giving a nervous,\r\nhalf-suppressed sigh, and then saying, \"It's very dark to-night, isn't\r\nit?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Adam, who had been thinking how he should best begin his\r\nsubject. \"I thought the mist was going to clear off better than this,\r\nbut that seems to look like dirty weather blowing up;\" and he pointed to\r\nthe watery shroud behind which lay the waning moon.\r\n\r\n\"I wish a storm would come on,\" said Eve: \"I should so like to see the\r\nsea tossing up and the waves dashing over everything.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! while we two are sitting here?\" said Adam, smiling.\r\n\r\n\"No: of course I don't mean now, this very minute, but some time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Some time when I'm away at sea?\" put in Adam.\r\n\r\nEve gave a little shudder: \"Not for the world! I should be frightened to\r\ndeath if a storm came on and you away. But you don't go out in very bad\r\nweather, do you, Adam?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not if I can help it, I don't,\" he answered. \"Why, would you mind if I\r\ndid?\" and he bent down so that he could look into her face. \"Eh, Eve,\r\nwould you?\"\r\n\r\nHis tone and manner conveyed so much more than the words that Eve felt\r\nit impossible to meet his gaze. \"I don't know,\" she faltered. \"What do\r\nyou ask me for?\"\r\n\r\n\"What do I ask you for?\" he repeated, unable longer to repress the\r\npassionate torrent which he had been striving to keep under. \"Because\r\nsuspense seems to drive me mad. Because, try as I may, I can't keep\r\nsilent any longer. I wanted, before I said more, to ask you about\r\nsomebody you've left behind you at London; but it's of no use. No matter\r\nwhat he may be to you, I must tell you that I love you, Eve--that you've\r\nmanaged in this little time to make every bit of my heart your own.\"\r\n\r\n\"Somebody in London?\" Eve silently repeated. \"Who could he mean? Not\r\nReuben May: how should he know about him?\"\r\n\r\nThe words of love that followed this surprise seemed swallowed up in her\r\ndesire to have her curiosity satisfied and her fears set at rest. \"What\r\ndo you mean about somebody I've left in London?\" she said; and the\r\nquestion, abruptly put, jarred upon Adam's excited mood, strained as his\r\nfeelings were, each to its utmost tension. This man she had left behind,\r\nthen, could even at a moment like this stand uppermost in her mind.\r\n\r\n\"A man, I mean, to whom, before you left, you gave a promise;\" and this\r\ntime, so at variance was the voice with Adam's former tones of\r\npassionate avowal, that, coupled with the shock of hearing that word\r\n\"promise,\" Eve's heart quailed, and to keep herself from betraying her\r\nagitation she was forced to say, with an air of ill-feigned amazement,\r\n\"A man I left? somebody I gave a promise to? I really don't know what\r\nyou mean.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, you do;\" and by this time every trace of wooing had passed from\r\nAdam's face, and all the love so late set flowing from his heart was\r\nchoked and forced back on himself. \"Try and remember some fellow who\r\nthinks he's got the right to ask how you're getting on among the country\r\nbumpkins, whether you ain't tired of them yet, and when you're coming\r\nback. Perhaps,\" he added, goaded on by Eve's continued silence, \"'twill\r\nhelp you if I say 'twas the one who came to see you off aboard the Mary\r\nJane. I suppose you haven't forgot _him_?\"\r\n\r\nEve's blood boiled at the sneer conveyed in Adam's tone and look.\r\nRaising her eyes defiantly to his, she said, \"Forgotten him? Certainly\r\nnot. If you had said anything about the Mary Jane before I should have\r\nknown directly who you meant. That person is a very great friend of\r\nmine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Friend?\" said Adam.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, friend--the greatest friend I've got.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'm very glad I know that, because I don't approve of friends. The\r\nwoman I ask to be my wife must be contented with me, and not want\r\nanything from anybody else.\"\r\n\r\n\"A most amiable decision to come to,\" said Eve. \"I hope you may find\r\nsomebody content to be so dictated to.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought I had found somebody already,\" said Adam, letting a softer\r\ninflection come into his voice. \"I fancied that at least, Eve, _you_\r\nwere made out of different stuff to the women who are always hankering\r\nto catch every man's eye.\"\r\n\r\n\"And pray what should make you alter your opinion? Am I to be thought\r\nthe worse of because an old friend, who had promised he would be a\r\nbrother to me, offers to see me off on my journey, and I let him come?\r\nYou must have a very poor opinion of women, Adam, or at least a very\r\npoor opinion of me.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the air of offended dignity with which she gave this argument forced\r\nAdam to exclaim, \"Oh, Eve, forgive me if I have spoken hastily: it is\r\nonly because I think so much more of you--place you so much higher than\r\nany other girl I ever saw--that makes me expect so much more of you. Of\r\ncourse,\" he continued, finding she remained silent, \"you had every right\r\nto allow your friend to go with you, and it was only natural he should\r\nwish to do so; only when I'm so torn by love as I am I feel jealous of\r\nevery eye that's turned upon you: each look you give another seems\r\nsomething robbed from me.\"\r\n\r\nEve's heart began to soften: her indignation was beginning to melt away.\r\n\r\n\"And when I heard he was claiming a promise, I--\"\r\n\r\n\"What promise?\" said Eve sharply.\r\n\r\n\"What promise did you give him?\" replied Adam warily, suspicion giving\r\nto security another thrust.\r\n\r\n\"That's not to the point,\" said Eve. \"You say I gave him a promise: I\r\nask what that promise was?\"\r\n\r\n\"The very question I put to you. I know what he says it was, and I want\r\nto hear if what he says is true. Surely,\" he added, seeing she\r\nhesitated, \"if this is only a friend, and a friend who is to be looked\r\non like a brother, you can't have given him any promise that if you can\r\nremember you can't repeat.\"\r\n\r\nEve's face betrayed her displeasure. \"Really, Adam,\" she said, \"I know\r\nof no right that you have to take me to task in this manner.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he answered: \"I was going to ask you to give me that right when\r\nyou interrupted me. However, that's very soon set straight. I've told\r\nyou I love you: now I ask you if you love me, and, if so, whether you\r\nwill marry me? After you've answered me I shall be able to put my\r\nquestions without fear of offence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you, indeed?\" said Eve. \"I should think that would rather depend\r\nupon what the answer may be.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whatever it may be, I'm waiting for it,\" said Adam grimly.\r\n\r\n\"Let me see: I must consider what it was I was asked,\" said Eve. \"First,\r\nif--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, don't trouble about the first: I shall be satisfied of that if you\r\nanswer the second and tell me you will accept me as a husband.\"\r\n\r\n\"Say keeper.\"\r\n\r\n\"Keeper, if that pleases you better.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you very much, but I don't feel quite equal to the honor. I'm not\r\nso tired yet of doing what pleases myself that I need submit my\r\nthoughts and looks and actions to another person.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you refuse to be my wife?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I do.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you cannot return the love I offer you?\"\r\n\r\nEve was silent.\r\n\r\n\"Do you hear?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I hear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then answer: have I got your love, or haven't I?\"\r\n\r\n\"Whatever love you might have had,\" she broke out passionately, \"you've\r\ntaken care to kill.\"\r\n\r\n\"Kill!\" he repeated. \"It must have been precious delicate if it couldn't\r\nstand the answering of one question. Look here, Eve. When I told you I\r\nhad given you my heart and every grain of love in it, I only spoke the\r\ntruth; but unless you can give me yours as whole and as entire as I have\r\ngiven mine, 'fore God I'd rather jump off yonder rock than face the\r\nmisery that would come upon us both. I know what 'tis to see another\r\ntake what should be yours--to see another given what you are craving\r\nfor. The torture of that past is dead and gone, but the devil it bred in\r\nme lives still, and woe betide the man or woman who rouses it!\"\r\n\r\nInstinctively Eve shrank back: the look of pent-up passion frightened\r\nher and made her whole body shiver.\r\n\r\n\"There! there! don't alarm yourself,\" said Adam, passing his hand over\r\nhis forehead as if to brush away the traces which this outburst had\r\noccasioned: \"I don't want to frighten you. All I want to know is, can\r\nyou give me the love I ask of you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I couldn't bear to be suspected,\" faltered Eve.\r\n\r\n\"Then act so that you would be above suspicion.\"\r\n\r\n\"With a person always on the watch, looking out for this and that, so\r\nthat one would be afraid to speak or open one's mouth, I don't see how\r\none could possibly be happy,\" said Eve. \"All one did, all one said,\r\nmight be taken wrongly, and when one were most innocent one might be\r\nthought most guilty. No: I don't think I could stand that, Adam.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" he said coldly. \"If you feel your love is too weak to bear\r\nthat, and a great deal more than that, you are very wise to withhold it\r\nfrom me: those who have much to give require much in return.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, don't think I haven't that in me which would make my love equal\r\nyours any day,\" said Eve, nettled at the doubt which Adam had flung at\r\nher. \"If I gave any one my heart, I should give it all; but when I do\r\nthat I hope it will be to somebody who won't doubt me and suspect me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I'd advise you not to give them cause to,\" said Adam.\r\n\r\n\"And I'd advise you to keep your cautions for those that need them,\"\r\nreplied Eve, rising from where she had been sitting and turning her face\r\nin the direction of home.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you needn't fear being troubled by any more I shall say,\" said\r\nAdam: \"I'm only sorry that I've been led to say what I have.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pray don't let that trouble you: such things, with me, go in at one ear\r\nand out at the other.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case I won't waste any more words,\" said Adam; \"so if you can\r\nkeep your tongue still you needn't fear being obliged to listen to\r\nanything I shall say.\"\r\n\r\nEve gave a little scornful inclination of her head in token of the\r\naccepted silence between them, and in silence the two commenced their\r\nwalk and took their way toward home.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nExcept the long surging roll of the waves, as in monotonous succession\r\nthey dashed and broke against the rocks, not a sound was to be heard.\r\nThe night had grown more lowering: the sprinkle of stars was hid behind\r\nthe dense masses of cloud, through which, ever and anon, the moon, with\r\nshadowy face, broke out and feebly cast down a glimmering light. Below,\r\nthe outspread stretch of water lay dark and motionless, its glassy\r\nsurface cold and glittering like steel. Walking a little in the rear of\r\nAdam, Eve shuddered as her eyes fell on the depths, over whose brink\r\nthe narrow path they trod seemed hanging. Instinctively she shrank\r\ncloser to the cliff-side, to be caught by the long trails of bramble\r\nwhich, with bracken and gorse, made the steep descent a bristly wall.\r\nInsensibly affected by external surroundings, unused to such complete\r\ndarkness, the sombre aspect of the scene filled her with nervous\r\napprehension: every bit of jutting rock she stumbled against was a\r\nyawning precipice, and at each step she took she died some different\r\ndeath. The terrors of her mind entirely absorbed all her former\r\nindifference and ill-humor, and she would have gladly welcomed any\r\naccident which would have afforded her a decent pretext for breaking\r\nthis horrible silence. But nothing occurred, and they reached the open\r\npiece of green and were close on the crumbling ruins of St. Peter's\r\nchapel without a word having passed between them. The moon struggled out\r\nwith greater effort, and, to Eve's relief, showed that the zigzag\r\ndangers of the path were past, and there was now nothing worse to fear\r\nthan what might happen on any uneven grassy slope. Moreover, the buzz of\r\nvoices was near, and, though they could not see the persons speaking,\r\nEve knew by the sound that they could not be very far distant. Having\r\nbefore him the peculiar want of reticence generally displayed by the\r\nPolperro folk, Adam would have given much to have been in a position to\r\nask Eve to remount the hill and get down by the other side; but under\r\npresent circumstances he felt it impossible to make any suggestion:\r\nthings must take their course. And without a word of warning he and Eve\r\ngained the summit of the raised elevation which formed a sheltered\r\nbackground to this favorite loitering-place, at once to find themselves\r\nthe centre of observation to a group of men whose noisy discussion they\r\nhad apparently interrupted.\r\n\r\n\"Why, 'tis my son Adam, ain't it?\" exclaimed the voice of Uncle Zebedee;\r\nand at the sound of a little mingled hoarseness and thickness Adam's\r\nheart sank within him.--\"And who's this he's a got with un, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tis me, Uncle Zebedee,\" said Eve, stepping down on to the flat and\r\nadvancing toward where the old man stood lounging--\"Eve, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Awh, Eve, is it?\" exclaimed Zebedee. \"Why, how long's t'wind veered\r\nround to your quarter, my maid? Be you two sweetheartin' then, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've been all day up to Aunt Hepzibah's,\" said Eve quickly, endeavoring\r\nto cover her confusion, \"and Adam came to fetch me back: that's how it\r\nis we're together.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wa-al, but he needn't ha' fetched 'ee 'less he'd got a mind for yer\r\ncompany, I s'pose,\" returned Zebedee with a meaning laugh. \"Come, come\r\nnow: 't 'ull niver do for 'ee to try to cabobble Uncle Zibedee. So you\r\nand Adam's courtyin', be 'ee? Wa-al, there's nuffin' to be said agen\r\nthat, I s'pose?\" and he looked round as if inviting concurrence or\r\ncontradiction.--\"Her's my poor brother Andrer's little maid, ye knaw,\r\nshipmates\"--and here he made a futile attempt to present Eve to the\r\nassembled company--\"what's dead--and drownded--and gone to Davy's\r\nlocker; so, notwithstandin' I'd lashins sooner 'twas our Joan he'd ha'\r\nfix'd on--Lord ha' massy!\" he added parenthetically, \"Joan's worth a\r\nhorsgead o' she--still, what's wan man's mate's another man's pison;\r\nand, howsomedever that lies, I reckon it needn't go for to hinder me\r\nfra' drinkin' their healths in a drap o' good liquor. So come along, my\r\nhearties;\" and, making a movement which sent him forward with a lurch,\r\nhe began muttering something about his sea-legs, the effect of which was\r\ndrowned in the shout evincing the ready satisfaction with which this\r\nproposal for friendly conviviality was hailed.\r\n\r\nEve drew in her breath, trying to gather up courage and combat down the\r\nhorrible suspicion that Uncle Zebedee was not quite himself, didn't\r\nexactly know what he was saying, had taken too much to drink. With\r\ncongratulatory intent she found herself jostled against by two or three\r\nothers near her, whose noisy glee and uncertain gait only increased her\r\nfears. What should she do? Where could she go? What had become of Adam?\r\nSurely he would not go and leave her amongst--\r\n\r\nBut already her question was answered by a movement from some one\r\nbehind, who with a dexterous interposition succeeded in placing himself\r\nbetween Uncle Zebedee and herself.\r\n\r\n\"Father,\" and Adam's voice sounded more harsh and stern than usual,\r\n\"leave Eve to go home as she likes: she's not used to these sort o'\r\nways, and she will not take things as you mean them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eh! what? How not mane 'em?\" exclaimed old Zebedee, taken aback by his\r\nson's sudden appearance. \"I arn't a said no harm that I knaws by:\r\nthere's no 'fence in givin' the maid a wet welcome, I s'pose.\"\r\n\r\nA buzz of dissatisfaction at Adam's interference inspired Zebedee with\r\nrenewed confidence, and with two or three sways in order to get the\r\nright balance he managed to bring himself to a standstill right in front\r\nof Adam, into whose face he looked with a comical expression of defiance\r\nand humor as he said, \"Why, come 'long with us, lad, do 'ee, and name\r\nthe liquor yerself, and see it passes round free and turn and turn\r\nabout: and let's hab a song or two, and get up Rozzy Treloar wi' his\r\nfiddle, and Zeke Orgall there 'ull dance us a hornpipe;\" and he began a\r\ndouble-shuffle with his feet, adding, as his dexterity came to a sudden\r\nand somewhat unsteady finish, \"Tis a ill wind that blows nobody no good,\r\nand a poor heart what never rejices.\"\r\n\r\nEve during this time had been vainly endeavoring to make her escape--an\r\nimpossibility, as Adam saw, under existing circumstances; and this\r\ndecided him to use no further argument; but, with his arm put through\r\nhis father's and in company with the rest of the group, he apparently\r\nconceded to their wishes, and, motioning Eve on, the party proceeded\r\nalong the path, down the steps and toward the quay, until they came in\r\nfront of the Three Pilchards, now the centre of life and jollity, with\r\nthe sound of voices and the preparatory scraping of a fiddle to enhance\r\nthe promise of comfort which glowed in the ruddy reflection sent by the\r\nbright lights and cheerful fire through the red window-curtain.\r\n\r\n\"Now, father,\" exclaimed Adam with a resolute grip of the old man's arm,\r\n\"you and me are homeward bound. We'll welcome our neighbors some other\r\ntime, but for this evening let's say good-night to them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-night?\" repeated Zebedee: \"how good-night? Why, what 'ud be the\r\nmanin' o' that? None o' us ain't agoin' to part company here, I hopes.\r\nWe'm all goin' to cast anchor to the same moorin's--eh, mates?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, no!\" said Adam, impatiently: \"you come along home with me now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Iss, iss, all right!\" laughed the old man, trying to wriggle out of his\r\nson's grasp; \"only not just yet a whiles. I'm agoin' in here to drink\r\nyour good health, Adam lad, and all here's a-comin' with me--ain't us,\r\nhearties?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pack of stuff! Drink my health?\" exclaimed Adam. \"There's no more\r\nreason for drinking my health to-night than any other night. Come along\r\nnow, father: you've had a hard day of it, you know, and when you get\r\nhome you can have whatever you want quietly by your own fireside.\"\r\n\r\nBut Zebedee, though perfectly good-humored, was by no means to be\r\npersuaded: he continued to laugh and writhe about as if the fact of his\r\ndetention was merely a good joke on Adam's part, the lookers-on abetting\r\nand applauding his determination, until Adam's temper could restrain\r\nitself no longer, and with no very pleasant explosion of wrath he let go\r\nhis hold and intimated that his father was free to take what course\r\npleased him most.\r\n\r\n\"That's right, lad!\" exclaimed old Zebedee heartily, shaking himself\r\ntogether. \"You'm a good son and a capital sailor-man, but you'm pore\r\ncompany, Adam--verra pore company.\"\r\n\r\nAnd with this truism (to which a general shout gave universal assent)\r\nringing in his ears, Adam strode away up the street with all possible\r\nspeed, and was standing in front of the house-door when he was suddenly\r\nstruck by the thought of what had become of Eve. Since they had halted\r\nin front of the Three Pilchards he had seen nothing of her: she had\r\ndisappeared, and in all probability had made her way home.\r\n\r\nThe thought of having to confront her caused him to hesitate: should he\r\ngo in? What else could he do? where had he to go? So, with a sort of\r\ndesperation, he pushed open the door and found himself within the\r\nsitting-room. It was empty; the fire had burnt low, the wick of the\r\nunsnuffed candle had grown long; evidently Eve had not returned; and\r\nwith an undefined mixture of regret and relief Adam sat down, leaned his\r\narms on the table and laid his head upon them.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole day the various excitements he had undergone had so\r\nkept his mind on the stretch that its powers of keen susceptibility\r\nseemed now thoroughly exhausted, and in place of the acute pain he had\r\npreviously suffered there had come a dull, heavy weight of despair,\r\nbefore which his usual force and determination seemed vanquished and\r\npowerless. The feeling uppermost was a sense of the injustice inflicted\r\non him--that he, who in practice and principle was so far removed above\r\nhis neighbors, should be made to suffer for their follies and misdeeds,\r\nshould have to bear the degradation of their vices. As to any hope of\r\nreclaiming them, he had long ago given that up, though not without a\r\ncertain disappointment in the omniscience of that Providence which could\r\nrefuse the co-operation of his valuable agency.\r\n\r\nAdam suffered from that strong belief in himself which is apt, when\r\ncarried to excess, to throw a shadow on the highest qualities.\r\nOutstepping the Pharisee, who thanked God that he was not like other\r\nmen, Adam thanked himself, and fed his vanity by the assurance that had\r\nthe Polperro folk followed his lead and his advice they would now be\r\nwalking in his footsteps; instead of which they had despised him as a\r\nleader and rejected him as a counsellor, so that, exasperated by their\r\nignorance and stung by their ingratitude, he had cast them off and\r\nabandoned them for ever; and out of this disappointment had arisen a dim\r\nshadow of some far-off future wherein he caught glimpses of a new life\r\nfilled with fresh hopes and successful endeavors.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment his heart had opened toward Eve her image seemed to be\r\nassociated with these hitherto undefined longings: by the light of her\r\nlove, of her presence, her companionship, all that had been vague seemed\r\nto take shape and grow into an object which was real and a purpose to be\r\naccomplished; so that now one of the sharpest pricks from the thorn of\r\ndisappointment came of the knowledge that this hope was shattered and\r\nthis dream must be abandoned. And, lost in moody retrospection, Adam sat\r\nstabbing desire with the sword of despair.\r\n\r\n\"Let me be! let me be!\" he said in answer to some one who was trying to\r\nrouse him.\r\n\r\n\"Adam, it's me: do look up;\" and in spite of himself the voice which\r\nspoke made him lift his head and look at the speaker. \"Adam, I'm so\r\nsorry!\" and Eve's face said more than her words.\r\n\r\n\"You've nothing to be sorry for,\" returned Adam sullenly.\r\n\r\n\"I want you to forgive me, Adam,\" continued Eve.\r\n\r\n\"I've nothing to forgive.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you have;\" and a faint flush of color came into her cheeks as she\r\nadded with hesitating confusion, \"You know I didn't mean you to take\r\nwhat I said as you did, Adam; because\"--and the color suddenly deepened\r\nand spread over her face--\"because I do care for you--very much indeed.\"\r\n\r\nAdam gave a despondent shake of his head. \"No, you don't,\" he said,\r\nsteadily averting his eyes; \"and a very good thing too. I don't know who\r\nthat wasn't forced to it would willingly have anything to do with such a\r\nGod-forsaken place as this is. I only know I'm sick of it, and of myself\r\nand my life, and everything in it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Adam, don't say that--don't say you're sick of life. At least, not\r\nnow;\" and she turned her face so that he might read the reason.\r\n\r\n\"And why not now?\" he asked stolidly. \"What have I now that I hadn't\r\nbefore?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, you've got me.\"\r\n\r\n\"You? You said you couldn't give me the love I asked you for.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, but I didn't mean it. What I said was because I felt so hurt that\r\nyou should suspect me as you seemed to.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never suspected you--never meant to suspect you. All I wanted you to\r\nknow was that I must be all or nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course; and I meant that too, only you--But there! don't let's drift\r\nback to that again;\" and as she spoke she leaned her two hands upon his\r\nshoulders and stood looking down. \"What I want to say is, that every bit\r\nof love I have is yours, Adam. I am afraid,\" she added shyly, \"you had\r\ngot it all before ever I knew whether you really wanted it or not.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why couldn't you tell me that before?\" he said bitterly.\r\n\r\n\"Why, is it too late now?\" asked Eve humbly.\r\n\r\n\"Too late? You know it can't be too late,\" exclaimed Adam, his old\r\nirritability getting the better of him: then, with a sudden revulsion of\r\nhis overwrought susceptibilities, he cried, \"Oh, Eve, Eve, bear with me\r\nto-night: I'm not what I want to be. The words I try to speak die away\r\nupon my lips, and my heart seems sunk down so low that nothing can\r\nrejoice it. To-morrow I shall be master of myself again, and all will\r\nlook different.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope so,\" sighed Eve tremulously. \"Things don't seem quite between us\r\nas they ought to be. I sha'n't wait for Joan,\" she said, holding out her\r\nhand: \"I shall go up stairs now; so good-night, Adam.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-night,\" he said: then, keeping hold of her hand, he drew her\r\ntoward him and stood looking down at her with a face haggard and full of\r\nsadness.\r\n\r\nThe look acted as the last straw which was to swamp the burden of Eve's\r\ngrief. Control was in vain, and in another instant, with Adam's arms\r\naround her, she lay sobbing out her sorrow on his breast, and the tears,\r\nas they came, thrust the evil spirit away. So that when, an hour later,\r\nthe two said good-night again, their vows had been exchanged and the\r\ntroth that bound them plighted; and Adam, looking into Eve's face,\r\nsmiled as he said, \"Whether for good luck or bad, the sun of our love\r\nhas risen in a watery sky.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nMost of the actions and events of our lives are chameleon-hued: their\r\ncolors vary according to the light by which we view them. Thus Eve, who\r\nthe night before had seen nothing but happiness in the final arrangement\r\nbetween Adam and herself, awoke on the following morning with a feeling\r\nof dissatisfaction and a desire to be critical as to the rosy hues which\r\nseemed then to color the advent of their love.\r\n\r\nThe spring of tenderness which had burst forth within her at sight of\r\nAdam's humility and subsequent despair had taken Eve by surprise. She\r\nknew, and had known for some time, that much within her was capable of\r\nanswering to the demands which Adam's pleading love would most probably\r\nrequire; but that he had inspired her with a passion which would make\r\nher lay her heart at his feet, feeling for the time that, though he\r\ntrampled on it, there it must stay, was a revelation entirely new, and,\r\nto Eve's temperament, rather humiliating. She had never felt any\r\nsympathy with those lovesick maidens whose very existence seemed\r\nswallowed up in another's being, and had been proudly confident that\r\neven when supplicated she should never seem to stoop lower than to\r\naccept. Therefore, just as we experience a sense of failure when we find\r\nour discernment led astray in our perception of a friend, so now,\r\nalthough she studiously avoided acknowledging it, she had the\r\nconsciousness that she had utterly misconceived her own character, and\r\nthat the balance by which she had adjusted the strength of her emotions\r\nhad been a false one. A dread ran through her lest she should be seized\r\nhold upon by some further inconsistency, and she resolved to set a watch\r\non the outposts of her senses, so that they might not betray her into\r\nfurther weakness.\r\n\r\nThese thoughts were still agitating her mind when Joan suddenly awoke,\r\nand after a time roused herself sufficiently to say, \"Why, whatever made\r\nyou pop off in such a hurry last night, Eve? I runned in a little after\r\nten, and there wasn't no signs of you nowheres; and then I come upon\r\nAdam, and he told me you was gone up to bed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Eve: \"I was so tired, and my foot began to ache again, so I\r\nthought there wasn't any use in my sitting up any longer. But you were\r\nvery late, Joan, weren't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very early, more like,\" said Joan: \"'twas past wan before I shut my\r\neyes. Why, I come home three times to see if uncle was back; and then I\r\nwouldn't stand it no longer, so I went and fetched un.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, not from--where he was?\" exclaimed Eve.\r\n\r\nJoan nodded her head. \"Oh Lors!\" she said, \"'tain't the fust time by\r\nmany; and,\" she added in a tone of satisfaction, \"I lets 'em know when\r\nthey've brought Joan Hocken down among 'em. I had Jerrem out, and uncle\r\natop of un, 'fore they knawed where they was. Awh, I don't stand beggin'\r\nand prayin', not I: 'tis 'whether or no, Tom Collins,' when I come, I\r\ncan tell 'ee.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, they'd stay a very long time before they'd be fetched by me,\"\r\nsaid Eve emphatically.\r\n\r\n\"Awh, don't 'ee say that, now,\" returned Joan. \"Where do 'ee think\r\nthere'd be the most harm in, then--sittin' comfortable at home when you\r\nmight go down and 'tice 'em away, or the goin' down and doin' of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've not a bit of patience with anybody who drinks,\" exclaimed Eve,\r\nevading a direct answer.\r\n\r\n\"Then you'll never cure anybody of it, my dear,\" replied Joan. \"You'm\r\nlike Adam there, I reckon--wantin' to set the world straight in one day,\r\nand all the folks in it bottommost side upward; but, as I tell un, he\r\ndon't go to work the right way. They that can't steer 'ull never sail;\r\nand I'll bet any money that when it comes to be counted up how many\r\nglasses o' grog's been turned away from uncle's lips, there'll be more\r\nset to the score o' my coaxin' than ever 'ull be to Adam's\r\nbullyraggin'.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps so,\" said Eve; and then, wishing to avoid any argument into\r\nwhich Adam could be brought, she adroitly changed the subject, and only\r\nindifferent topics were discussed until, their dressing completed, the\r\ntwo girls were ready to go down stairs.\r\n\r\nThe first person who answered the summons to breakfast was Uncle\r\nZebedee--not heavy-eyed and shamefaced, as Eve had expected to see him,\r\nbut bright and rosy-cheeked as an apple. He had been up and out since\r\nsix o'clock, looking after the repairs which a boat of his was laid up\r\nto undergo, and now, as he came into the house fresh as a lark, he\r\nchirruped in a quavery treble,\r\n\r\n    \"Tom Truelove woo'd the sweetest fair\r\n      That e'er to tar was kind:\r\n    Her face was of a booty rare--\r\n\r\nThat's for all the world what yourn is,\" he said, breaking off to bestow\r\na smacking kiss on Joan. \"So look sharp, like a good little maid as you\r\nbe, and gi'e us sommat to sit down for;\" and he drew a chair to the\r\ntable and began flourishing the knife which had been set there for him.\r\nThen, catching sight of Eve, whose face, in her desire to spare him,\r\nbetrayed an irrepressible look of consciousness, he exclaimed, \"Why,\r\nthey've bin tellin' up that I was a little over-free in my speech last\r\nnight about you, Eve: is there any truth in it, eh? I doan't fancy I\r\ncould ha' said much amiss--did I?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, nothing to signify, uncle.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Twas sommat 'bout you and Adam, warn't it?\" he continued with a\r\npuzzled air: \"'tis all in my head here, though I can't zackly call it to\r\nmind. That's the divil o' bein' a little o'ertook that ways,\" he added\r\nwith the assurance of meeting ready sympathy: \"'tis so bafflin' to set\r\nthings all ship-shape the next mornin'. I minds so far as this, that it\r\nhad somehow to do with me holdin' to it that you and Adam was goin' to\r\nbe man and wife; but if you axes for the why and the wherefore, I'm\r\nblessed if I can tell 'ee.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, whatever put such as that into your head?\" said Joan sharply.\r\n\r\n\"Wa-al, the liquor, I reckon,\" laughed Zebedee. \"And, somehow or\r\n'nother, Maister Adam didn't seem to have overmuch relish for the\r\nnotion;\" and he screwed up his face and hugged himself together as if\r\nhis whole body was tickled at his son's discomfiture. \"But there! never\r\nyou mind that, Eve,\" he added hastily: \"there's more baws than one to\r\nPolperro, and I'll wager for a halfscore o' chaps ready to hab 'ee\r\nwithout yer waitin' to be took up by my son Adam.\"\r\n\r\nPoor Eve! it was certainly an embarrassing situation to be placed in,\r\nfor, with no wish to conceal her engagement, to announce it herself\r\nalone, and unaided by even the presence of Adam, was a task she\r\nnaturally shrank from. In the endeavor to avoid any direct reply she sat\r\nwatching anxiously for Adam's arrival, her sudden change of manner\r\nconstrued by Zebedee into the effect of wounded vanity, and by Joan into\r\ndispleasure at her uncle's undue interference. By sundry frowns and nods\r\nof warning Joan tried to convey her admonitions to old Zebedee, in the\r\nmidst of which Adam entered, and with a smile at Eve and an inclusive\r\nnod to the rest of the party took a chair and drew up to the table.\r\n\r\n\"Surely,\" thought Eve, \"he intends telling them.\"\r\n\r\nBut Adam sat silent and occupied with the plate before him.\r\n\r\n\"He can't think I can go living on here with Joan, even for a single\r\nday, and they not know it;\" and in her perplexity she turned on Adam a\r\nlook full of inquiry and meaning.\r\n\r\nStill, Adam did not speak: in his own mind he was casting over the\r\nthings he meant to say when, breakfast over and the two girls out of the\r\nway, he would invite his father to smoke a pipe outside, during the\r\ncompanionship of which he intended taking old Zebedee decidedly to task,\r\nand, putting his intended marriage with Eve well to the front, clinch\r\nhis arguments by the startling announcement that unless some reformation\r\nwas soon made he would leave his native place and seek a home in a\r\nforeign land. Such words and such threats as these could not be uttered\r\nto a father by a son save when they two stood quite alone; and Adam,\r\nafter meeting a second look from Eve, shook his head, feeling satisfied\r\nthat she would know that only some grave requirement deterred him from\r\nimmediately announcing the happiness which henceforth was to crown his\r\nlife. But our intuition, at the best, is somewhat narrow, and where the\r\nheart is most concerned most faulty: therefore Eve, and Adam too, felt\r\neach disappointed in the other's want of acquiescence, and inclined to\r\nbe critical on the lack of mutual sympathy.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the door opened and in walked Jerrem, smiling and apparently\r\nmore radiant than usual under the knowledge that he was more than\r\nusually an offender. Joan, who had her own reasons for being very\r\nconsiderably put out with him, was not disposed to receive him very\r\ngraciously; Adam vouchsafed him no notice whatever; Uncle Zebedee,\r\noppressed by the sense of former good fellowship, thought it discreet\r\nnot to evince too much cordiality; so that the onus of the morning's\r\nwelcome was thrown upon Eve, who, utterly ignorant of any offence Jerrem\r\nhad given, thought it advisable to make amends for the pettish\r\nimpatience she feared she had been betrayed into on the previous\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nOld Zebedee, whose resolves seldom lasted over ten minutes, soon fell\r\ninto the swing of Jerrem's flow of talk; a little later on and Joan was\r\nforced to put in a word; so that the usual harmony was just beginning to\r\nrecover itself when, in answer to a remark which Jerrem had made, Eve\r\nmanaged to turn the laugh so cleverly back upon him that Zebedee, well\r\npleased to see what good friends they were growing, exclaimed, \"Stop her\r\nmouth! stop her mouth, lad! I'd ha' done it when I was your years twenty\r\ntimes over 'fore this. Her's too sarcy--too sarcy by half, her is.\"\r\n\r\nUp started Jerrem, but Adam was before him. \"I don't know whether what\r\nI'm going to say is known to anybody here already,\" he burst out, \"but I\r\nthink it's high time that some present should be told by me that Eve has\r\npromised to be my wife;\" and, turning, he cast a look of angry defiance\r\nat Jerrem, who, thoroughly amazed, gradually sank down and took\r\npossession of his chair again, while old Zebedee went through the dumb\r\nshow of giving a long whistle, and Joan, muttering an unmeaning\r\nsomething, ran hastily out of the room. Eve, angry and confused, turned\r\nfrom white to red and from red to white.\r\n\r\nA silence ensued--one of those pauses when some event of our lives seems\r\nturned into a gulf to separate us from our former surroundings.\r\n\r\nAdam was the first to speak, and with a touch of irony he said, \"You're\r\nnone of you very nimble at wishing us joy, I fancy.\"\r\n\r\n\"And no wonder, you've a-tooked us all aback so,\" said old Zebedee. \"'T\r\nseems to me I'm foaced to turn it round and round afore I can swaller it\r\nfor rale right-down truth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, is it so very improbable, then?\" asked Adam, already repenting the\r\nabruptness of the disclosure.\r\n\r\n\"Wa-al, 'twas no later than last night that you was swearin' agen and\r\ncussin' everybody from stem to starn for so much as mentionin' it as\r\nlikely. Now,\" he added, with as much show of displeasure as his cheery,\r\nweatherbeaten old face would admit of, \"I'll tell 'ee the mind I've got\r\nto'ard these sort o' games: if you see fit to board folks in the smoke,\r\nwhy do it and no blame to 'ee, but hang me if I can stomach 'ee sailin'\r\nunder false colors.\"\r\n\r\n\"There wasn't anything of false colors about us, father,\" said Adam in a\r\nmore conciliatory tone; \"for, though I had certainly spoken to Eve, it\r\nwas not until after I'd parted with you last night that she gave me her\r\nanswer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Awh!\" said the old man, only half propitiated. \"Wa-al, I s'pose you can\r\nsettle your consarns without my help; but I can tell 'ee this much, that\r\nif my Joanna had took so long afore she could make her mind up, I'm\r\nblamed if her ever should ha' had the chance o' bein' your mother,\r\nAdam--so there!\"\r\n\r\nAdam bit his lip with vexation. \"There's no need for me to enter upon\r\nany further explanations,\" he said: \"Eve's satisfied, I'm satisfied, so\r\nI don't see why you shouldn't be satisfied.\"\r\n\r\n\"Awh, I'm satisfied enough,\" said Zebedee; \"and, so far as that goes,\r\nthough I ain't much of a hand at speechifyin', I hopes that neither of\r\n'ee 'ull never have no raison to repent yer bargain. Eve's a fine\r\nbowerly maid, so you'm well matched there; and so long as she's ready to\r\nlisten to all you say and bide by all you tells her, why 'twill be set\r\nfair and sail easy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can assure you Eve isn't prepared to do anything of the sort, Uncle\r\nZebedee,\" exclaimed Eve, unable to keep silence any longer. \"I've always\r\nbeen told if I'd nothing else I've got the Pascals' temper; and that,\r\naccording to your own showing, isn't very fond of sitting quiet and\r\nbeing rode over rough-shod.\"\r\n\r\nThe whistle which Uncle Zebedee had tried to choke at its birth now came\r\nout shrill, long and expressive, and Adam, jumping up, said, \"Come,\r\ncome, Eve: we've had enough of this. Surely there isn't any need to take\r\nsuch idle talk as serious matter. If you and me hadn't seen some good in\r\none another we shouldn't have taken each other, I suppose; and, thank\r\nthe Lord, we haven't to please anybody but our two selves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wa-al, 'tis to be hoped you'll find that task aisier than it looks,\"\r\nretorted Uncle Zebedee with a touch of sarcasm; while Jerrem, after\r\nwatching Adam go out, endeavored to throw a tone of regret into the\r\nflattering nothings he now whispered by way of congratulation, but Eve\r\nturned impatiently away from him. She had no further inclination to talk\r\nor to be talked to; and Uncle Zebedee having by this time sought solace\r\nin a pipe, Jerrem joined him outside, and the two sauntered away\r\ntogether toward the quay.\r\n\r\nLeft to the undisturbed indulgence of her own reflections, Eve's mood\r\nwas no enviable one--the more difficult to bear because she had to\r\ncontrol the various emotions struggling within her. She felt it was time\r\nfor plain speaking between her and Adam, and rightly judged that a\r\nproper understanding come to at once would be the safest means of\r\nsecuring future comfort. Turn and twist Adam's abrupt announcement as\r\nshe would, she could assign but one cause for it, and that cause was an\r\noverweening jealousy; and as the prospect came before her of a lifetime\r\nspent in the midst of doubt and suspicion, the strength of her love\r\nseemed to die away and her heart grew faint within her. For surely if\r\nthe demon of jealousy could be roused by the sight of commonplace\r\nattentions from one who was in every way like a brother--for so in Eve's\r\neyes Jerrem seemed to be--what might not be expected if at any time\r\ncircumstances threw her into the mixed company of strangers? Eve had\r\nseen very little of men, but whenever chance had afforded her the\r\nopportunity of their society she had invariably met with attention, and\r\nhad felt inwardly gratified by the knowledge that she was attracting\r\nadmiration; but now, if she gave way to this prejudice of Adam's, every\r\ntime an eye was turned toward her she would be filled with fear, and\r\neach time a look was cast in her direction her heart would sink with\r\ndread.\r\n\r\nWhat should she do? Give him up? Even with the prospect of possible\r\nmisery staring at her, Eve could not say yes, and before the thought had\r\nmore than shaped itself a dozen suggestions were battling down the dread\r\nalternative. She would change him, influence him, convert him--anything\r\nbut give him up or give in to him. She forgot how much easier it is to\r\nconceive plans than to carry them out--to arrange speeches than to utter\r\nthem. She forgot that only the evening before, when, an opportunity\r\nbeing afforded, she had resolved upon telling Adam the whole\r\ncircumstance of Reuben May and the promise made between them, while the\r\nwords were yet on her lips she had drawn them back because Adam had said\r\nhe knew that the promise was \"nothing but the promise of a letter;\" and\r\nEve's courage had suddenly given way, and by her silence she had led him\r\nto conclude that nothing else had passed between them. Joan had spoken\r\nof the envious grudge which Adam had borne toward Jerrem because he had\r\nshared in his mother's heart, so that this was not the first time Adam\r\nhad dropped in gall to mingle with the cup of his love.\r\n\r\nThe thought of Joan brought the fact of her unexplained disappearance to\r\nEve's mind, and, full of compunction at the bare suspicion of having\r\nwounded that generous heart, Eve jumped up with the intention of seeking\r\nher and of bringing about a satisfactory explanation. She had not far to\r\ngo before she came upon Joan, rubbing and scrubbing away as if the\r\nwelfare of all Polperro depended on the amount of energy she could throw\r\ninto her work. Her face was flushed and her voice unsteady, the natural\r\nconsequences of such violent exercise, and which Eve's approach but\r\nseemed to lend greater force to.\r\n\r\n\"Joan, I want to speak to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Awh, my dear, I can't listen to no spakin' now,\" replied Joan hastily,\r\n\"and the tables looking as they do.\"\r\n\r\n\"But Tabithy always scrubs the tables, Joan: why should you do it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tabithy's arms ain't half so young as mine--worse luck for me or for\r\nshe!\"\r\n\r\nHaving by this time gained a little insight into Joan's peculiarities,\r\nEve argued no further, but sat herself down on a convenient seat,\r\nwaiting for the time when the rasping sound of the brush would come to\r\nan end. Her patience was put to no very great tax, for after a few\r\nminutes Joan flung the brush along the table, exclaiming, \"Awh, drabbit\r\nthe ole scrubbin'! I must give over. I b'lieve I've had enuf of it for\r\nthis time, 't all events.\"\r\n\r\n\"Joan, you ain't hurt with me, are you?\" said Eve, trying to push her\r\ninto the seat from which she had just risen. \"I wanted to be the first\r\nto tell you, only that Adam spoke as he did, and took all I was going to\r\nsay out of my mouth. It leaves you to think me dreadfully sly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Awh, there wasn't much need for tellin' me,\" said Joan with a sudden\r\nrelax of manner. \"When I didn't shut my eyes o' purpose I could tell,\r\nfrom the first, what was certain to happen.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was more than I could, then,\" said Eve. \"I hadn't given it a thought\r\nthat Adam meant to speak to me, and when he asked me I was quite taken\r\naback, and said 'No' for ever so long.\"\r\n\r\n\"What made 'ee change yer mind so suddent, then?\" said Joan bluntly.\r\n\r\nEve hesitated. \"I hardly know,\" she said, with a little confusion. \"I\r\nthink it was seeing him so cast down made me feel so dreadfully sorry.\"\r\n\r\n\"H'm!\" said Joan. \"Didn't 'ee never feel no sorrow for t'other poor chap\r\nthat wanted to have 'ee--he to London, Reuben May?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not enough to make me care in that way for him: I certainly never did.\"\r\n\r\n\"And do you care for Adam, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Think?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I am sure I do.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's better. Well, Eve, I'll say this far;\" and Joan gave a sigh\r\nbefore the other words would come out: \"I'd rather it should be you than\r\nanybody else I ever saw.\"\r\n\r\nThe struggle with which these words were said, their tone and the look\r\nin Joan's face, seemed to reveal a state of feeling which Eve had not\r\nsuspected. Throwing her arms round her, she cried out, \"Oh, Joan, why\r\ndidn't he choose you? You would have been much better for him than me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lord bless the maid!\"--and Joan tried to laugh through her tears--\"I\r\nwouldn't ha' had un if he'd axed me. Why, there'd ha' bin murder 'tween\r\nus 'fore a month was out: us 'ud ha' bin hung for one 'nother. No: now\r\ndon't 'ee take no such stuff as that into yer head, 'cos there's no\r\nsense in it. Adam's never looked 'pon me not more than a sister;\" and,\r\nbreaking down, Joan sobbed hysterically; \"and when you two's married I\r\nshall feel 'zackly as if he was a brother, and be gladder than e'er a\r\none else to see how happy you makes un.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's if I _do_ make him happy,\" said Eve sadly.\r\n\r\n\"There's no fear but you'll do that,\" said Joan, resolutely wiping the\r\ntears from her eyes; \"and 'twill be your own fault if you bain't happy\r\ntoo yourself, Eve. Adam's got his fads to put up with, and his fancies\r\nsame as other men have, and a masterful temper to keep under, as nobody\r\ncan tell better than me; but for rale right-down goodness I shouldn't\r\nknow where to match his fellow--not if I was to search the place\r\nthrough; and, mind 'ee, after all, that's something to be proud of in\r\nthe man you've got to say maister to.\"\r\n\r\nEve gave a little smile: \"But he must let me be mistress, you know,\r\nJoan.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right! only don't you stretch that too far,\" said Joan warningly,\r\n\"or no good 'ull come of it; and be foreright in all you do, and spake\r\nthe truth to un. I've many a time wished I could, but with this to hide\r\no' that one's and that to hush up o' t'other's, I know he holds me for a\r\ndownright liard; and so I am by his measure, I 'spects.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure you're nothing of the sort, Joan,\" said Eve. \"Adam's always\r\nsaying how much people think of you. He told me only yesterday that he\r\nwas certain more than half the men of the place had asked you to marry\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did he?\" said Joan, not wholly displeased that Adam should hold this\r\nopinion. \"Awh, and ax they may, I reckon, afore I shall find a man to\r\nsay 'Yes' to.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is what I used to think myself,\" said Eve.\r\n\r\n\"Iss, and so you found it till Roger put the question,\" replied Joan\r\ndecisively. Then, after a minute's pause, she added, \"What be 'ee goin'\r\nto do 'bout the poor sawl to London, then--eh? You must tell he\r\nsomehow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don't see that,\" said Eve. \"I mean to write to him, because I\r\npromised I would; and I shall tell him that I've made up my mind not to\r\ngo back, but I sha'n't say anything more. There isn't any need for it,\r\nthat I see--at least, not yet a while.\"\r\n\r\n\"Best to tell un all,\" argued Joan. \"Why shouldn't 'ee? 'Tis the same,\r\nso far as you'm concerned, whether he's killed to wance or dies by\r\ninches.\"\r\n\r\nBut Eve was not to be persuaded. \"There isn't any reason why I should,\"\r\nshe said.\r\n\r\n\"No reason?\" replied Joan. \"Oh, Eve, my dear,\" she added, \"don't 'ee let\r\nhappiness harden your heart: if love is sweet to gain, think how bitter\r\n'tis to lose; and, by all you've told me, you'll forfeit a better man\r\nthan most in Reuben May.\"\r\n\r\n_The Author of \"Dorothy Fox._\"\r\n\r\n[TO BE CONTINUED.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE SKUNK RIVER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lady of Shalott, looking into the mirror which reflected the highway\r\n\"a bowshot from her bower-eaves,\" saw the villagers passing to their\r\ndaily labor in the barley-fields; market-girls in red cloaks and damsels\r\nof high degree; curly shepherd-boys and long-haired pages in gay livery;\r\nan abbot on an ambling pad and knights in armor and nodding plumes; and\r\nher constant pastime was to weave these sights into the magic web on\r\nwhich she wrought. I undertake, in a modest way, to follow her example,\r\nand weave a series of pictures from the sights that daily meet my eyes.\r\n\r\nThe highway which runs a bowshot from _my_ bower-eaves is a\r\nmuch-travelled road, leading from the farms of a prairie country into a\r\nprairie town. It is a stripe of black earth fifteen or twenty feet wide,\r\nthe natural color of the soil, ungraded, ungravelled, and just now half\r\na foot deep in mud from the melting February snows. Looking in the\r\ndirection from which it comes, a mile or two of rolling prairie-land is\r\nvisible, divided into farms of one hundred, one hundred and forty or one\r\nhundred and sixty acres. Just now it is faded yellow in hue, with\r\npatches of snow in the hollows, and bare of trees, stumps or fences,\r\nexcept the almost invisible wire-fences which separate the fields from\r\nthe road and from each other. Here and there, at wide intervals, a few\r\nfarm-houses can be seen, sheltered on the north and west by a\r\nthickly-set row of cottonwood or Lombardy poplar trees, which serve in a\r\ngreat measure to break the sweep of the pitiless Iowa winds. Most of the\r\nhouses are large and comfortable, and are surrounded by barns, haystacks\r\nand young orchards, denoting a long residence and prosperity; but two or\r\nthree, far off on the horizon, are small wooden structures, set on the\r\nbare prairie, without a tree or outbuilding near them, and looking bleak\r\nand lonely. To one who knows something of the straitened lives, the\r\nstruggles with poverty, that go on in them, they seem doubly pitiful and\r\ndesolate.\r\n\r\nThe town into which the highway leads lies straight before my window,\r\nflat, unpicturesque, uninteresting, marked by the untidiness of\r\ncrudeness and the untidiness of neglect. The ungraded streets are\r\ntrodden into a sticky pudding by horses' feet, the board sidewalks are\r\nnarrow, uneven and broken, and the crossings are deep in mud. In the\r\neastern part of the town the dwellings are large, comfortable, even\r\nelegant, with well-kept grounds filled with trees and shrubbery, and\r\nthere are a few of the same character scattered here and there\r\nthroughout the town; but the large majority of houses, those that give\r\nthe place its discouraged, unambitious look, are small wooden dwellings,\r\na story or a story and a half high, with the end facing the street and a\r\nshed-kitchen behind. Those that are painted are white or brown, but many\r\nare unpainted, have no window-shutters and are surrounded by untidy\r\nyards and fences that need repair.\r\n\r\nThe centre of the town, both in position and importance, is \"The\r\nSquare.\" This is an open space planted thickly with trees, which have\r\nnow grown to a large size and cast a refreshing shade over the crowd\r\nthat gathers there in summer to hear political speeches or to celebrate\r\nthe Fourth of July. It is surrounded by hitching-racks, and on Saturdays\r\nand other unusually busy days these racks, on all the four sides of the\r\nSquare, are so full of teams--generally two-horse farm-wagons--that\r\nthere is not room for another horse to be tied. Facing the Square\r\nand extending a block or two down adjacent streets are the\r\nbusiness-houses--stores, banks, express-office, livery-stables,\r\npost-office, gas-office, the hotels, the opera-house, newspaper and\r\nlawyers' offices. Many of the buildings are of brick, three stories\r\nhigh, faced or trimmed with stone, but the general effect is marred by\r\nthe contiguity of little wooden shanties used as barber-shops and\r\nmeat-markets.\r\n\r\nExcept in the north-east, where the land is rolling and densely wooded,\r\nthe horizon-line is flat and on a level with our feet. The sun rises\r\nfrom the prairie as he rises from the ocean, and his going down is the\r\nsame: no far-off line of snowy mountains, no range of green hills nor\r\nforest-crest, intercepts his earliest and his latest rays. Over this\r\nwide stretch of level land the wind sweeps with unobstructed violence,\r\nand more than once in the memory of settlers it has increased to a\r\ndestructive tornado, carrying buildings, wagons, cattle and human beings\r\nlike chaff before it. Just now, a sky of heavenly beauty and color bends\r\nover it, and through the wide spaces blow delicious airs suggestive of\r\nearly spring.\r\n\r\nNearly every day, and often many times a day, farm-wagons drawn by two\r\nhorses pass along the highway in front of my window. The wagon-bed is\r\nfilled with sacks of wheat or piled high with yellow corn, and on the\r\nhigh spring-seat in front sits the farmer driving, and by him his wife,\r\nher head invariably wrapped in a white woollen nubia or a little shawl,\r\nworn as a protection against the catarrh-producing prairie winds.\r\nCuddled in the hay at their feet, but keeping a bright lookout with\r\nround eager eyes, are two or three stout, rosy children, and often there\r\nis a baby in the mother's arms. When \"paw\" has sold his wheat or corn\r\nthe whole family will walk around the Square several times, looking in\r\nat the shop-windows and staring at the people on the sidewalk. When they\r\nhave decided in which store they can get the best bargains, they will go\r\nin and buy groceries, calico and flannel, shoes for the children, and\r\nperhaps a high chair for the baby. Later in the day they rattle by\r\nagain, the farmer sitting alone on the spring-seat, the wife and\r\nchildren, as a better protection against the wind, on some hay in the\r\nnow empty wagon-bed behind. So they jolt homeward over the rough, frozen\r\nroad or toil through sticky mud, as the case may be, well pleased with\r\ntheir purchases and their glimpse of town, and content to take up again\r\nthe round of monotonous life on their isolated prairie farm.\r\n\r\nSometimes on spring-like days, when the roads are good, two women or a\r\nwoman and one or two half-grown children drive by in a spring-wagon,\r\nbringing chickens, eggs, and butter to market. Heavy wagons loaded with\r\nlarge clear blocks of ice go by every day, the men walking and driving\r\nor seated on a board seat at the extreme rear of the wagon. The great\r\ncrystal cubes look, as they flash in the sunshine, like\r\nbuilding-material for Aladdin's palace quarried from some mine of\r\njewels, but they are only brought from the Skunk River, three miles\r\ndistant, to the ice-houses in town, and there packed away in sawdust\r\nfor summer use. On two days of the week--shipping days for\r\nlive-stock--farm-wagons with a high railing round the beds go by, and\r\ninside the railing, crowded as thickly as they can stand, are fat black\r\nor black-and-white hogs, which thrust their short noses between the\r\nboards and squeal to get out. They are unloaded at the cattle-pens near\r\nthe railroad, and thence shipped to pork-packers at Chicago.\r\n\r\nAnd sometimes half a dozen Indians, the roving gypsies of the West,\r\ndressed in warm and comfortable clothing and wrapped in red or blue\r\nblankets, ride into town on good horses. They belong to the Sacs and\r\nFoxes, a friendly, well-disposed remnant of people who live half a day's\r\nride to the north-east of this place. They are better off than the\r\naverage of white people, for every man, woman and child owns a quarter\r\nsection of land in the Indian Territory, and receives an annuity of\r\nmoney besides. Immediately after pay-day they visit the neighboring\r\ntowns, their pockets full of silver dollars, and buy whatever necessity\r\nor fancy dictates. The women are generally neat and comely in\r\nappearance, and the pappooses that peer from the bags hung on either\r\nside of the ponies are bright-eyed, round-faced youngsters, who never\r\ncry and seldom cause any trouble. They seem to be born with a certain\r\namount of gravity, and a capacity for patient endurance that forbids\r\nthem to lift up their voices at every slight provocation after the\r\nmanner of white babies. The Indian ponies too are models of endurance.\r\nThe squaws tie their purchases in blankets and hang them across the\r\nbacks of their ponies, swing their pappooses to one side and perhaps a\r\njoint of fresh meat to the other, then mount on top astride, dig the\r\npony's neck with their moccasined heels and start off at a trot.\r\nSometimes a large party of Indians, men, women and children, camp on\r\nSkunk River and fish. In the spring they make a general hegira to a\r\nwooded section two or three days' journey to the northward for the\r\npurpose of tapping the maple trees and boiling down the syrup into\r\nsugar. As before mentioned, they are friendly and inoffensive in their\r\ndealings with the white people, but their patience must be sorely tried\r\nsometimes. The town-boys hoot at them, throw stones at their ponies, and\r\ntry in many ways to annoy them. I remember once seeing them pass through\r\nanother town on their annual spring excursion to the sugar-camps. Two of\r\nthe pack-ponies had strayed behind the train, and a squaw rode back to\r\ndrive them ahead. A number of town-boys, thinking this an excellent\r\nopportunity to have some fun, threw sticks at them and drove them off on\r\nby-streets and up back alleys. The squaw tried patiently again and again\r\nto get them together and join the train, but it was not until a brave\r\nturned back and came to her assistance that she succeeded. Neither of\r\nthe Indians uttered a word or betrayed by sign or expression that they\r\nnoticed the insults of the boys.\r\n\r\nOften, when the mud is too deep for teams, farmers go by on horseback,\r\nwith their horses' tails tied into a knot to keep them out of the mud.\r\nThey have come to town to learn the price of wheat, corn or hogs, to\r\nbargain for some article of farm use, or perhaps to pay the interest on\r\ntheir mortgages. Many of them have not yet paid entirely for their\r\nfarms, and comparatively few are free from debt in some form. Some,\r\nbeing ambitious to have large farms, have taken more land than they can\r\nprofitably manage or pay for in a number of years, and are what is\r\ncalled \"land poor:\" others, though content with modest portions of sixty\r\nor a hundred acres, have not yet been able, by reason of poor crops,\r\ntheir own mismanagement or some other cause, to clear their farms of\r\ndebt. They work along from year to year, supporting their families,\r\npaying the interest, and paying off the principal little by little. When\r\nthe last payment is made and the mortgage released, then the owner can\r\nhold the land in spite of all other creditors. His store-bills or other\r\ndebts may run up to hundreds of dollars, but his homestead cannot be\r\ntaken to satisfy them by any process of law. This is the homestead law\r\nof the State. A single exception is made in favor of one creditor: the\r\nmechanic who has erected the buildings can hold what is called a\r\nmechanic's lien upon the property until his claim is satisfied.\r\nAdvantage is often taken of this law for the purpose of defrauding\r\ncreditors. In one instance a merchant who owned a good residence in a\r\ncity and a valuable store-property, sold or transferred his residence,\r\nmoved his family into the rooms above his store, and soon afterward\r\nfailed. His creditors tried to get possession of his store-property, and\r\nentered suit, but the testimony proved that it was his dwelling also,\r\nand therefore exempt under the homestead law. The amount of land that\r\ncan be held in this way is limited to forty acres.\r\n\r\nBeginning life in a new country with small capital involves many years\r\nof hard work and strict economy, perhaps privation and loneliness. This\r\ncomes especially hard on the farmers' wives, many of whom have grown up\r\nin homes of comfort and plenty in the older States. Ask the men what\r\nthey think of Iowa, and they will say that it is a fine State; it has\r\nmany resources and advantages; there is room for development here; the\r\navenues to positions of profit and honor are not so crowded as they are\r\nin the older States; a good class of emigrants are settling up the\r\nState: that, on the whole, Iowa has a bright future before it. But the\r\nwomen do not deal in such generalities. Their own home and individual\r\nlife is all the world to them, and if that is encompassed with toil and\r\nhardship, if all their cherished longings and ambitions are denied and\r\ntheir hearts sick with hope deferred, this talk about the undeveloped\r\nresources of Iowa and its future greatness has no interest or meaning\r\nfor them. In their isolated homes on the bleak prairie they have few\r\nsocial opportunities, and their straitened means do not allow them to\r\nbuy books or pictures, to take papers or magazines, or to indulge in\r\nmany of the little household ornaments dear to the feminine heart. What\r\nwonder, then, if their eyes have a weary, questioning look, as if they\r\nwere always searching the flat prairie-horizon for some promise or hope\r\nof better days, something fresh and stimulating to vary the dull\r\nmonotony of toil?\r\n\r\n\"There's a better time coming,\" the farmer says. \"When we get the farm\r\npaid for we will build a new house and send the children to town to\r\nschool;\" and so the slow years go by. If every new country is not\r\nactually fertilized with the heart's blood of women, the settling and\r\ndevelopment of it none the less require the sacrifice of their lives.\r\nOne generation must cast itself into the breach, must toil and endure\r\nand wear out in the struggle with elementary forces, in order that those\r\nwho come after them may begin life on a higher plane of physical comfort\r\nand educational and social advantages. They have not, like the settlers\r\nof Eastern States, had to fell forests, grub up stumps, and so wrest\r\ntheir farms from Nature; but they have none the less endured the\r\ninevitable hardships of life in a new, thinly-settled country, far from\r\nmarkets, railroads, schools, churches and all that puts a market value\r\non man's labor. I see many women who have thus sacrificed, and are\r\nsacrificing, their lives. Their faces are wrinkled, their hands are hard\r\nwith rough, coarse work, they have long ago ceased to have any personal\r\nambitions; but their hopes are centred in their children. Their\r\nself-abnegation is pathetic beyond words. Looking at them and musing on\r\ntheir lives, I think truly\r\n\r\n    The individual withers, and the world is more and more.\r\n\r\nMust the old story be repeated over and over again? Must some hearts be\r\ndenied all their lives long in order that a possible good may come to\r\nothers in the future? Must some lives, full of throbbing hopes and\r\naspirations, be put down in the dust and mire as stepping-stones, that\r\nthose who come after may go over dryshod? Is the individual not to be\r\nconsidered, but only the good of the mass? Can there be justice and\r\nrighteousness in a plan that requires the lifelong martyrdom of a few?\r\nHave not these few as much right to a full and free development, to\r\nliberty to work out their own ambitions, as have any of the multitude\r\nwho reap the benefit of their sacrifices? But peace: this little\r\nexistence is not all there is of life, and in the sphere of wider\r\nopportunities and higher activity that awaits us there will be room for\r\nthese thwarted, stunted lives to grow and flourish and bloom in immortal\r\nbeauty. With our limited vision, our blind and short-sighted judgment,\r\nhow can we presume to say what is harsh or what is kind in the\r\ndiscipline of life? The earth as she flies on her track through space\r\ndeviates from a straight line less than the eighth of an inch in the\r\ndistance of twenty miles. We, seeing only twenty miles of her course,\r\nwould declare that it was perfectly straight, that it did not curve in\r\nthe slightest degree; yet flying on that same course the earth makes\r\nevery year her vast elliptical journey around the sun. Could we see a\r\nhundred million miles of the track, we should discern the curve very\r\nplainly. Could we see a part of the boundless future of a life whose\r\ncircumstances in this little span of existence were limited and\r\ndepressing, we should discern the meaning of much that viewed separately\r\nseems hard and bitter and useless.\r\n\r\nThe settlers of this State have chiefly emigrated from the older\r\nStates--Indiana, Ohio and the Eastern and Middle States. There are many\r\nforeigners--Swedes, Norwegians, Germans, Dutch and Irish--who generally\r\nlive in colonies. The German element predominates, especially in the\r\ncities. In the south-western part of the State there is a colony of\r\nRussian Mennonites, and at Amana, in the eastern part, there are several\r\nflourishing German colonies where the members hold all property in\r\ncommon. They preserve to some extent the quaint customs and costumes of\r\nthe Fatherland, and one set down in the midst of their homes without\r\nknowing where he was might well believe himself in Germany. The Swedes\r\nand Norwegians bear a good character for industry and sobriety: the\r\nyoung women are in great demand as house-servants and command good\r\nwages.\r\n\r\nThe emigrants from older States were many of them farmers of small\r\nmeans, who came through in covered wagons with their families and\r\nhousehold stuff. In pleasant weather this mode of travelling was not\r\ndisagreeable, but in rainy or cold weather it was very uncomfortable. No\r\none could walk in the deep mud: the whole family were obliged to huddle\r\ntogether in the back part of the wagon, wrapped in bed-quilts or other\r\ncovers, while the driver, generally the head of the family, sat on the\r\nseat in front, exposed to the cold or driving rain. The horses slowly\r\ndragged the heavily-laden wagon through the mud, and the progress toward\r\ntheir new home was tedious in the extreme. The wagons were usually\r\ncommon farm-wagons with hoops of wood, larger and stouter than barrel\r\nhoops, arched over the bed and covered with white cotton cloth.\r\nSometimes, as a protection against rain, a large square of black\r\noil-cloth was spread over the white cover. The front of the wagon was\r\nleft open: at the back the cover was drawn together by a string run\r\nthrough the hem. Before leaving his old home the farmer generally held a\r\npublic sale and disposed of his household furniture, farming utensils\r\nand the horses and cattle he did not intend to take with him. Sometimes\r\nthis property went by private sale to the purchaser of his farm. He\r\nreserved the bedding, a few cooking utensils and other necessaries.\r\nThese were loaded into the wagon, a feed-box for the horses was fastened\r\nbehind, an axe strapped to it, and a tar-bucket hung underneath. Flour\r\nand bacon were stored away in a box under the driver's seat, or, if\r\nthey expected no chance for replenishing on the way, another wagon was\r\nfilled with stores. Then, when all was ready, the farmer and his family\r\nlooked their last upon their old home, bade good-bye to the friends who\r\nhad gathered to see them off, took their places in the wagon and began\r\nthe long, tedious journey to \"Ioway.\" Hitherto they had had a local\r\nhabitation and a name: now, for several months, they were to be known\r\nsimply as \"movers.\" Among the memories of a childhood spent in a village\r\non the old National 'Pike those pertaining to movers are the earliest.\r\nIt was the pastime of my playmates and myself to hang on the fence and\r\nwatch the long train of white-covered wagons go by, always toward the\r\nsetting sun. Sometimes there were twenty in a train, and the slow creak\r\nof the wagons, the labored stepping of the horses, had an important\r\nsound to our childish ears. It was\r\n\r\n    The tread of pioneers\r\n    Of nations yet to be.\r\n\r\nLooking backward to that time, it seems to me now that they went by\r\nevery day. It was a common sight, but one which never lost its interest\r\nto us. The cry of \"Movers! movers!\" would draw us from our play to hang\r\nidly on the fence until the procession had passed. In some instances\r\nnightfall overtook them just as they reached our village, and they\r\ncamped by the roadside, lighting fires on the ground with which to cook\r\ntheir evening meal. Our timidity was greater than our curiosity, and we\r\nseldom went near their camps. Movers, in our estimation, were above\r\n\"stragglers,\" the name by which we knew the vagrants--forerunners of the\r\ngreat tribe of tramps--who occasionally passed along the road with a\r\nbundle on a stick over their shoulders; but still, they were a vague,\r\nunknown class, whose intentions toward us were questionable, and we\r\nremained in the vicinity of our mothers' apron-strings so long as they\r\nwere in the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nWhen the weeks or months of slow travel during the day and camping out\r\nby night were over, and the new home on the prairie was reached, the\r\ndiscomforts and privations of the emigrating family were not ended: they\r\nwere only fairly begun. There was no house in which to lay their heads,\r\nno sawmill where lumber could be obtained, no tree to shelter them,\r\nunless they had the good fortune to locate near a stream--nothing but a\r\nsmooth, level expanse of prairie-sod, bright green and gay with the\r\nflowers of early summer or faded and parched with the droughts of\r\nautumn. Sometimes they camped in the open air until lumber could be\r\nbrought from a distance and a rude shanty erected, but often they built\r\na turf house, in which they passed their first winter. These houses were\r\nconstructed by cutting blocks of turf about eighteen inches square--the\r\nroots of prairie-grass being that long--and piling one upon another\r\nuntil the walls were raised to the desired height. Slender poles were\r\nthen laid across from wall to wall, and on these other strips and\r\nsquares of turf were piled until a roof thick enough to keep out the\r\nrain was formed. A turf fireplace and chimney were constructed at one\r\nend; the opening left for entrance was braced with poles and provided\r\nwith a door; and sometimes a square opening was cut in the end opposite\r\nthe chimney and a piece of muslin stretched across it to serve as a\r\nwindow. The original earth formed the floor, and piles of turf covered\r\nwith bedding served as beds. It was only when the family intended to\r\nlive some time in the turf house that all these pains were taken to make\r\nit comfortable. Many of these dwellings were dark huts, with floors a\r\nfoot or two below the level of the ground and without window or chimney.\r\nThese were intended for temporary occupation. A few of this kind, still\r\ninhabited, are to be seen in the sparsely-settled north-western part of\r\nthe State. I do not mean this description to apply in a general sense to\r\nthe early settlers of Iowa. Many parts of the State are heavily wooded,\r\nand cabins of hewed logs chinked with mud are still to be seen here and\r\nthere--specimens of the early homes. In the regions where turf houses\r\nwere necessary prairie-hay was burned as fuel.\r\n\r\nWhen his family was housed from the weather the farmer turned his\r\nattention to his land. The virgin sod had to be broken and the rich\r\nblack soil turned up in ridges to the air and sunlight. When the ground\r\nwas prepared the stock of seed-corn was planted or wheat sown, and the\r\nfarmer's old life began again under new and quite different\r\ncircumstances. In the eastern and oldest-settled part of the State these\r\nbeginnings date back a generation: in the western part they are still\r\nfresh and recent. In the old part well-cultivated fields, large barns,\r\norchards, gardens and comfortable farm-houses greet the traveller's eye:\r\nin the new he may travel for half a day without seeing a single\r\ndwelling, and may consider himself fortunate if he does not have to pass\r\nthe night under the lee side of a haystack.\r\n\r\nAfter a foothold has been gained in a new country and a home\r\nestablished, a generation, perhaps two, must pass away before a fine\r\ntype of humanity is produced. The fathers and mothers have toiled for\r\nthe actual necessaries of life, and gained them. The children are\r\nsupplied with physical comforts. Plenty of food and exercise in the pure\r\nair give them stalwart frames, good blood and perfect animal health, but\r\nthere is a bovine stolidity of expression in their faces, a\r\nsuggestion of kinship with the clod. They are honest-hearted and\r\nwell-meaning--stupid, not naturally, but because their minds have never\r\nbeen quickened and stimulated. They grope in a blind way for better\r\nthings, and wonder if life means no more than to plough and sow and\r\nreap, to wash and cook and sew. I see young people of this class by the\r\nscore, and my heart goes out toward them in pity, though they are all\r\nunconscious of needing pity. Perhaps one out of every hundred will break\r\nfrom the slowly-stepping ranks and run ahead to taste of the springs of\r\nknowledge reserved for the next generation, but the vast majority will\r\ngo down to their graves without ever attaining to the ripeness and\r\nsymmetry of a fully-developed life. Their children perhaps--certainly\r\ntheir grand-children--will attain a fine physical and mental type; and\r\nby that time \"the prairies\" will cease to be a synonym for lack of\r\nsociety and remoteness from liberal and refining influences.\r\n\r\nThe land in this vicinity is largely devoted to wheat, corn and oats:\r\nmuch, however, is used for pasturage, and several fine stock-farms lie\r\nwithin a radius of five miles. Sheep-rearing is a profitable industry,\r\nthe woollen manufactory at this place affording a convenient and ready\r\nmarket for the clip. But the statistics of Iowa show that the rearing of\r\nhogs is a more prominent industry than any of these. The agricultural\r\nfairs that are held at the county-seats in August or September every\r\nyear serve to display the growth of these and other industries and the\r\ndevelopment of the resources of the country, as well as the advance in\r\nmaterial comfort. The fair-ground is generally a smooth plat of ground\r\nseveral acres in extent just outside the city limits, and besides the\r\nrace-track and wooden \"amphitheatre\" there are sheds for cattle, stalls\r\nfor horses, pens for hogs and sheep and poultry, a large open shed for\r\nthe exhibition of agricultural machinery and implements, a long wooden\r\nbuilding--usually called \"Farmers' Hall\"--where fruits, grain and\r\nvegetables are displayed, and another, called \"Floral Hall,\" where there\r\nis a motley display consisting of flowering plants and cut flowers,\r\nneedlework, embroidery, pieced bed-quilts, silk chair-cushions and\r\nsofa-pillows, jellies, preserves, jams, butter, cake, bread--the\r\nhandiwork of women. There is generally a crowd of women from the country\r\naround these exhibits, examining them and bestowing friendly comment or\r\ncriticism.\r\n\r\nThe fair which is held here every year affords a good opportunity for a\r\nstudy of the bucolic character. Farm-wagons, full of men, women and\r\nchildren, come in from the country early in the morning, and by eleven\r\no'clock the halls are crowded with red-faced and dusty sightseers, who\r\nelbow their way good-humoredly from one attractive exhibit to another,\r\nand gaze with open eyes and mouth and loud and frequent comment. At noon\r\nthey retire to their wagons or the shade of the buildings to eat their\r\ndinner, which they have brought from home in a large basket, and there\r\nis a great flourish of fried chicken legs and wings and a generous\r\ndisplay of pies, pickles and ginger-bread. The young men and half-grown\r\nboys have scorned the slow progress of the farm-wagons, and have come\r\ninto town early on horseback. They have looked forward to this occasion\r\nfor months, and perhaps have bought a suit of \"store clothes\" in honor\r\nof it. They have already seen the various exhibits, and now that the\r\ndinner-hour has arrived they seek refreshment--not from the family\r\ndinner-basket, but from some of the various eating-stands temporarily\r\nerected on the grounds--and buy pop-beer, roasted peanuts and candy of\r\nthe vendors, who understand the art of extracting money from the rural\r\npockets. Then in the afternoon come the races, and, having paid a\r\nquarter for a seat in the \"amphitheatre,\" they give themselves up to the\r\ngreat excitement of the day. The incidents of fair-time will serve as\r\nfood for thought and conversation for weeks afterward. It is the\r\nlegitimate dissipation of the season.\r\n\r\nWhat character shall I choose as a typical Iowan? Not the occupant of\r\nthe large brick house with tall evergreens in front which meets my sight\r\nwhenever I look toward the country. An old woman lives there alone,\r\nexcept for a servant or two, having buried her husband and ten children.\r\nShe is worth a hundred thousand dollars, but can neither read nor write.\r\nHer strong common sense and deep fund of experience supply her lack of\r\neducation, and one would not think while listening to her that she was\r\nignorant of letters. Her life has been one of toil and sorrow, but her\r\nexpression is one of brave cheerfulness. She and her husband came to\r\nthis place forty years ago. They were the first white settlers, and for\r\nneighbors they had Indians and wolves. They entered most of the land on\r\nwhich the town now stands, and when other settlers came in and the town\r\nwas laid out their land became valuable, and thus the foundation of\r\ntheir fortune was laid. But as riches increased, cares also increased:\r\nthe husband was so weighed down by responsibility and anxiety that his\r\nmind gave way, and in a fit of despondency he committed suicide. The\r\nsons and daughters who died, with the exception of two or three, were\r\ntaken away in childhood. So the large mansion, with its richly-furnished\r\nrooms, is shut up from the sunlight and rarely echoes to the patter of\r\nchildish feet. The mistress lives in the back part, but exercises a care\r\nover the whole house, which is kept in a state of perfect order and\r\nneatness. Not a speck of dirt is to be seen on the painted wood-work or\r\nthe window-glass, not a stain mars the floor--long as the deck of a\r\nship--of the porch which extends the length of the ell. The plates in\r\nthe corner cupboard in the sitting-room are freshly arranged every day,\r\nthe tins in the kitchen shine till you can see your face in them, and in\r\nsummer the clean flower-beds, bright with pansies, roses, carnations and\r\ngeraniums, that border the long walk leading to the front gate and adorn\r\nthe side yards, attest the care and neatness of the mistress. Though she\r\nhas lived on the prairie for forty years, yet the expressions that savor\r\nof her early life in a densely-wooded State still cling to her, and if\r\nyou find her in her working-dress among her flowers she will beg you to\r\nexcuse her appearance, adding, \"I look as if I was just out of the\r\ntimber.\"\r\n\r\nBut this character, though interesting, is not a typical one. Neither is\r\nthat of the pinched, hungry-looking little man whose five acres and\r\nsmall dwelling meet my sight when I look toward the country in another\r\ndirection. His patch of ground is devoted to market-gardening, and from\r\nits slender profits he is trying to support himself and wife and four\r\nchildren and pay off a mortgage of several hundred dollars. He has\r\nlately invented an ingenious toy for children, and is trying to raise\r\nenough money to get it patented, hoping when that is done to reap large\r\nprofits from the sale of it. He is like a poor trembling little mouse\r\ncaught and held in the paws of a cruel cat. Sometimes Fate relaxes her\r\ngrip on him, and he breathes freer and dares to hope for a larger\r\nliberty: then she puts her paw on him again, and tosses him and plays\r\nwith him in very wantonness.\r\n\r\nNeither are the three old-maid sisters whose house I often pass types of\r\nIowa character, but I cannot forbear describing them. Their names are\r\nSemira, Amanda and Melvina. There is nothing distinctive in their\r\npersonal appearance, but their character, as expressed in their home and\r\nsurroundings, is quite interesting. Their little low house is on a\r\ncorner lot, and as the other three corners are occupied by large\r\ntwo-story houses, it seems lower still by contrast. It is unpainted, and\r\nhas a little wooden porch over the front door. The floors are covered\r\nwith homemade carpet, and braided mats are laid before each door and in\r\nfront of the old-fashioned bureau, which has brass rings for handles on\r\nthe drawers. A snow tree made of frayed white cotton or linen cloth\r\nadorns the table in the best room; woolly dogs with bead eyes and\r\ncotton-flannel rabbits with pink ears stand on the mantel; a bead\r\nhanging-basket filled with artificial flowers decorates the window; an\r\nelaborate air-castle, made of straw and bright worsted, hangs from the\r\nmiddle of the low ceiling; and hung against the wall, between two\r\nglaring woodcuts representing \"Lady Caroline\" in red and \"Highland Mary\"\r\nin blue, is a deep frame filled with worsted flowers, to which a\r\nbutterfly and a bumble-bee have been pinned. Paper lacework depends from\r\ntheir kitchen-shelves, and common eggshells, artificially colored,\r\ndecorate the lilac-bushes in the side yard. They are always making new\r\nmats or piecing quilts in a new pattern.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the first bluebird warbles they begin to work in their flower\r\nand vegetable garden, and from then until it is time to cover the\r\nverbena-beds in the fall I rarely pass without seeing one or more of\r\nthem, with sunbonnet on head and hoe in hand, busy at work. Besides\r\nkeeping their little front yard a mass of gorgeous bloom and their\r\nvegetable garden free from weed or stone, they raise canary-birds to\r\nsell and take care of a dozen hives of bees. Last fall I frequently saw\r\nall three of them in the yard, with a neighbor or two called in for\r\nconference, and all twittering and chattering like blackbirds in March.\r\nFinally, the mystery was solved. Going past one day, I saw a carpenter\r\ndeliberately cutting out the whole end of the house, and soon a large\r\nbay-window made its appearance. When this was completed three rows of\r\nshelves were put up inside close to the glass, and immediately filled\r\nwith plants in pots and tin cans. What endless occupation and\r\nentertainment the watering and watching and tending of these must afford\r\nthe sisters during winter!\r\n\r\nNeither does another neighbor of mine supply the type I seek--the old\r\nQuaker farmer, who is discontented and changeable in his disposition,\r\nhaving lived in Indiana a while, then in Iowa, then in Indiana again,\r\nand who is now in Iowa for the second time. He rents some land which\r\nlies just across the railroad, and in summer, when he is ploughing the\r\ngrowing corn, I hear him talking to his horse. He calls her a \"contrary\r\nold jade,\" and jerks the lines and saws her mouth, and says, \"Get over\r\nin that other row, I tell thee!\" Once I heard him mutter to her, when he\r\nwas leading her home after the day's work was done, \"I came as near\r\nkillin' thee to-day as ever I did.\"\r\n\r\nI will take for one type a man whom we met last summer in the country.\r\nWe had driven for miles along the country roads in search of a certain\r\nlittle glen where the maiden-hair ferns grew waist-high and as broad\r\nacross as the fronds of palms, and having found it and filled our\r\nspring-wagon with the treasures, we set out to return home by another\r\nroad. We lost our way, but did not regret it, as this mischance made\r\nknown to us the most stately and graceful tree we had ever seen--one\r\nthat was certainly worth half a day's ride to see. The road left the\r\ntreeless uplands, where the sunshine reflected from the bright yellow\r\nstubble of the newly-cut wheat-fields beat against our faces with a\r\nsteady glare, and dipped into a cool, green, shady hollow where cows\r\ncropped the rich grass or stood knee-deep in the water of a little\r\nstream. Well they might stand in quiet contentment: a king might have\r\nenvied them their surroundings. Overhead rose a dozen or more of the\r\ntallest and finest elms we had ever seen, stretching their thick\r\nbranches till they met and formed a canopy so dense that only a stray\r\nsunbeam or two pierced through and fell upon the smooth green sward.\r\nPeerless among them stood an elm of mighty girth and lofty height, its\r\nwidely-stretching branches as large around, where they left the trunk,\r\nas a common tree, and clothed to the farthest twig with luxuriant\r\nfoliage. And all up and down the mossy trunk and around the branches\r\ngrew young twigs from a few inches to a foot or two in length, half\r\nhiding the shaggy bark with their tender green leaves. It was a\r\ncombination of tree-majesty and grace that is rarely seen. In a tropical\r\nforest I have beheld a lofty tree covered thickly all over its trunk and\r\nbranches with ferns and parasitic plants, but the sight, though\r\nbeautiful, was suggestive of morbid, unnatural growth. This royal elm\r\nout of its own sap had clothed its trunk as with a thickly-twining vine.\r\nWhen, after gazing our fill, we drove reluctantly out of the shady green\r\nhollow into the sunshine, and began to climb a hill, we saw at the top a\r\nsmall house surrounded by fruit trees and shaded in front by a\r\ngrape-arbor. On reaching it we stopped to ask our way of a man who sat\r\nin his shirt-sleeves near the front door, fanning himself with his straw\r\nhat. He seemed frank and inclined to talk, and asked us to stop and rest\r\na while in the shade. We did so, and his wife brought us some fresh\r\nbuttermilk to drink, the children gathering about to look at us as if\r\nour advent was the incident of the month. In conversation we learned\r\nthat he was the owner of forty acres, which he devoted largely to the\r\ncultivation of small fruits. The land was paid for, with the exception\r\nof a mortgage of three hundred dollars, which he hoped to lift in a\r\nseason or two if the yield was good.\r\n\r\n\"We're doing well now,\" he said, \"but when we started, eight years ago,\r\nit was truly discouraging. There was no house on the place when we came\r\nhere. We put up the room we now use as a kitchen, and lived in it for\r\ntwo years and a half. It was so small that it only held a bed, a table,\r\na cook-stove and two or three chairs, and when the table was drawn out\r\nfor meals my wife had to set the rocking-chair on the bed, because there\r\nwasn't room for it on the floor. She helped me on the farm the first\r\nyear or two. We moved here late in the spring, and I only had time to\r\nget the sod broken before corn-planting time. My wife had a lame foot\r\nthat spring, but I made her a sort of crutch-stilt, and with this she\r\nwalked over the ground as I ploughed it, making holes in the earth by\r\nmeans of it and dropping in the corn. She also rode the reaper when our\r\nwheat was ripe the next year, and I followed, binding and stacking. She\r\nhas helped me in many other ways on the farm, for she is as ambitious as\r\nI am to have a place free from debt which we can call our own. We added\r\nthese two other rooms in the third year, and when we are out of debt and\r\nhave money ahead we shall put up another addition: we shall need it as\r\nthe children grow up. I have a nice lot of small fruit--strawberries,\r\nraspberries, currants, gooseberries--and besides these I sell every\r\nspring a great many early vegetables. The small fruits pay me more to\r\nthe acre than anything else I could raise. There is a good market for\r\nthem in the neighboring towns, and I seldom have to hire any help. My\r\nchildren do most of the picking.\"\r\n\r\nIt is only a bit of personal history, to be sure, but it affords an\r\ninsight into the life of one who, like many others in this State, began\r\nwith only his bare hands and habits of industry and economy for capital.\r\n\r\nAnother typical illustration is supplied by a man whose home we visited\r\nin the winter. His comfortable farm-house was overflowing with the good\r\nthings of life: a piano and an organ stood in the parlor, and a\r\nwell-filled bookcase in the sitting-room; a large bay-window was bright\r\nwith flowering plants; and base-burner coal-stoves and double-paned\r\nwindows mocked at the efforts of the wintry winds and kept perpetual\r\nsummer within. In the large barn were farm-wagons, a carriage, a buggy,\r\na sleigh--a vehicle for every purpose. The farmer invited us one morning\r\nto step into a large sled which stood at the door, and took us half a\r\nmile to his stock-yards. There we saw fat, sleek cattle by the dozen and\r\nfat hogs by the score, great cribs bursting with corn, a windmill pump\r\nand other conveniences for watering stock. Besides all these possessions\r\nthis man owns two or three other good farms, and has money loaned on\r\nmortgages; in short, is worth about fifty thousand dollars, every cent\r\nof which he has gained by his own exertions in the last twenty years. He\r\nsaid: \"When my father died and his estate was divided among his\r\nchildren, each of us received eighty-three dollars as his share. I\r\nresolved then that if thrift and energy could avail anything I would\r\nhave more than that to leave to each of my children when I died. It has\r\nrequired constant hard work and shrewd planning, but I have gained my\r\nstake, and am not a very old man yet,\" passing his hand over his hair,\r\nwhich was thinly sprinkled with gray.\r\n\r\nThis man gave us a description of a tornado which passed over that\r\nportion of the State a number of years ago. It was shortly after he was\r\nmarried and while he was staying at his father-in-law's house. The whole\r\nfamily were away from home that day, and when they returned they found\r\nonly the cellar. The house had been lifted from its foundation, and\r\ncarried so far on the mighty wings of the hurricane that nothing\r\npertaining to it was ever found except the rolling-pin and a few boards\r\nof the yellow-painted kitchen-floor. Of a new farm-wagon nothing\r\nremained but one tire, and that was flattened out straight. The trees\r\nthat stood in the yard had been broken off at the surface of the ground.\r\nThe grass lay stretched in the direction of the hurricane as if a flood\r\nof water had passed over it. Horses, cattle and human beings had been\r\nlifted and carried several rods through the air, then cast violently to\r\nearth again. Those who witnessed the course of the tornado said that it\r\nseemed to strike the ground, then go up in the air, passing harmlessly\r\nover a mile or two of country, then strike again, all the time whirling\r\nover and over, and occasionally casting out fragments of the spoils it\r\nhad gathered up. After passing east to a point beyond the Mississippi it\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nThis part of Iowa has rich deposits of coal, and mining is a regular and\r\nimportant business. The coal-mines lying a few miles south of this place\r\nare the largest west of the Mississippi River. A thriving little town\r\nhas grown up around them, composed chiefly of miners' cottages, stores\r\nand superintendents' dwellings. A creek winds through it whose banks are\r\nshaded by elms and carpeted in spring and early summer with\r\nprairie-flowers; and a range of wooded hills in whose depths the richest\r\ncoal-deposits lie lends a picturesque aspect to the scene, and partly\r\ncompensates for the dreary look of the town itself, the comfortless\r\nappearance of many of the miners' houses and the great heaps of slag and\r\nrefuse coal at the mouth of the mines. Mules hitched to little cars\r\nserve to draw the coal out of several of the mines, but the largest one\r\nis provided with an engine, which, by means of an endless rope of\r\ntwisted wire, pulls long trains of loaded cars out of the depths of the\r\nmine and up to a high platform above the railroad, whence the coal is\r\npitched into the waiting cars beneath. Sixty-five railroad cars are\r\nsometimes loaded in one day from this single mine. The coal is soft\r\ncoal, and is sold by retail at from six to seven cents a bushel.\r\n\r\nOne April day, when the woods were white and pink with the bloom of the\r\nwild plum and crab trees and the ground was blue with violets, we rode\r\nover to this place, and, hitching our horses to some trees growing over\r\nthe principal mine, we descended to the entrance. A miner, an\r\nintelligent middle-aged man who was off work just then, volunteered to\r\nbe our guide, and after providing each of us with a little oil lamp like\r\nthe one he wore in his hat-brim, he led us into the dark opening that\r\nyawned in the hillside. The passage was six or seven feet wide, and so\r\nlow that we could not stand erect. Under our feet was the narrow track,\r\nthe space between the ties being slippery with mud: over our heads and\r\non either hand were walls of rock, with a thick vein of coal running\r\nthrough them, braced every few feet with heavy timbers. The track began\r\nto descend, and soon we lost sight of the daylight and had to depend\r\nentirely on the feeble glimmer of our lamps. We occasionally came to\r\nsmooth-plastered spaces in the walls, the closed-up mouths of old\r\nside-tunnels, and placing our hands upon them felt that they were warm.\r\nFires were raging in the abandoned galleries, but, being shut away from\r\nthe air and from access to the main tunnel, they were not dangerous. The\r\ndangers usually dreaded by the miners are the falling of heavy masses of\r\nearth and rock from the roof of the gallery and the sudden flow of water\r\ninto the mine from some of the secret sources in the hillside. After\r\npenetrating about a quarter of a mile into the mine and descending one\r\nhundred and twenty feet, we reached the end of the main tunnel and saw\r\nthe great wheel, fixed in the solid rock, on which the endless steel\r\nrope turned. A train of loaded cars had passed out just before we\r\nentered the mine, and on a switch near the end of the track stood\r\nanother train of empty cars. The air thus far on our dark journey had\r\nbeen cool and good, for the main tunnel was ventilated by means of\r\nair-shafts that pierced the hillside to the daylight above; but now our\r\nguide opened the door of what seemed a subterranean dungeon, closed it\r\nbehind us when we had passed through, lifted a heavy curtain that hung\r\nbefore us, and ushered us into a branch-tunnel where the air was hot and\r\nstifling and heavy with the fumes of powder. At the farther end we saw\r\ntiny specks of light moving about. As we neared them we found that they\r\nwere lamps fastened in the hat-bands of the miners at work in this\r\ndistant tunnel--literally, \"the bowels of the earth.\" Some were using\r\npicks and shovels, others were drilling holes in the solid coal and\r\nputting in blasts of gunpowder. When these blasts were fired a\r\nsubterranean thunder shook the place: it seemed as if the hill were\r\nfalling in upon us. Little cars stood upon the track partly filled with\r\ncoal, and mules were hitched to them. The forms of these animals loomed\r\nlarge and dark in the dim light: they seemed like some monsters of a\r\nprevious geologic age. The men themselves, blackened with coal and grimy\r\nwith powder-smoke, might have seemed like gnomes or trolls had we not\r\nseen their homes in the plain, familiar sunlight above, and known that\r\nthey were working for daily bread for themselves and families. They are\r\npaid according to the amount of coal they dig. Some have earned as high\r\nas one hundred and thirty dollars a month, but half that sum would be\r\nnearer the average.\r\n\r\nAs we left this shaft and came back into the main tunnel we saw a miner\r\nsitting by the track with his small tin bucket open. It was noon and he\r\nwas eating his dinner. It might just as well have been midnight, so\r\ndense was the darkness. We seemed to have been an uncomputable time in\r\nthe depths, yet, glancing at the bunch of wild flowers in my belt, I saw\r\nthat they were only beginning to wilt. Did poor Proserpine have the same\r\nfeeling when she was ravished from the sunshine and the green and\r\nflowery earth and carried into the dark underground kingdom of Pluto?\r\nRemembering her fate, I whispered to my companion, \"We will not eat\r\nanything while here--no, not so much as one pomegranate-seed.\"\r\n\r\nThere are many smaller coal-mines in this vicinity--hardly a hillside\r\nbut has a dark doorway leading into it--but they are not all worked\r\nregularly or by more than a few hands.\r\n\r\nOn the road leading from town to the Skunk River one has glimpses of\r\nanother industry. Limekilns, with uncouth signs announcing lime for sale\r\nat twenty-five cents a bushel, thrust themselves almost into the road,\r\nand the cabins or neatly-whitewashed board huts of the lime-burners\r\nborder the way. Some have grass-plots and mounds of flowers around them:\r\nothers are without ornament, if we except the children with blue eyes,\r\nred cheeks and hair like corn-silk that hang on the fence and watch us\r\nride by.\r\n\r\nSkunk River is a broad, still stream, with hilly banks heavily wooded\r\nwith willow, oak, maple, sycamore and bass-wood. Here we find the\r\nearliest wild flowers in spring: blue and purple hepaticas blossom among\r\nthe withered leaves on the ground while the branches above are still\r\nbare, and a little later crowds of violets and spring-beauties brighten\r\nthe tender grass; clusters of diacentra--or \"Dutchman's breeches,\" as\r\nthe children call them--nod from the shelter of decaying stumps to small\r\nyellow lilies with spotted leaves and tufts of fresh green ferns.\r\n\r\nThe place is equally a favorite bird-haunt. The prairie-chicken, the\r\nbest-known game-bird of the State, chooses rather the open prairie, but\r\nwild-ducks settle and feed here in their migratory journeys, attracting\r\nthe sportsman by their presence; the fish-hawk makes his nest in the\r\ntrees on the bank; the small blue heron wades pensively along the\r\nmargin; and the common wood-birds, such as blackbirds, bluebirds, jays,\r\nsparrows and woodpeckers, chatter or warble or scold among the branches.\r\nSometimes the redbird flashes like a living flame through the green\r\ntree-tops, or the brilliant orange-and-black plumage of the Baltimore\r\noriole contrasts with the lilac-gray bark of an old tree-trunk.\r\n\r\nBesides the small wild flowers there are many shrubs and trees that\r\nbloom in spring. The haw tree and wild plum put forth masses of small\r\ncreamy-white flowers, the redbud tree blooms along the water-courses,\r\nthe dogwood in the woods and the wild crab-apple upon the open hillside.\r\nThe crab trees often form dense thickets an acre or two in extent, and\r\nwhen all their branches are thickly set with coral buds or deep-pink\r\nblossoms they form a picture upon which the eye delights to rest. Spring\r\nredeems even the flat prairie from the blank monotony which wearies the\r\neye in winter. There are few places in this vicinity where the virgin\r\nsod has not been broken, consequently few spots where the original,\r\nmuch-praised prairie-flowers grow; but a tender green clothes all the\r\nplain, hundreds of meadow-larks sing in the grass, the tints and colors\r\nof the sky are lovely beyond words, and the balmy winds breathe airs of\r\nParadise.\r\n\r\nEven the town, whose ugliness has offended artistic taste and one's love\r\nof neatness all winter, clothes itself in foliage and hides its\r\nungraceful outlines in bowery verdure. Lilacs scent the air, roses crowd\r\nthrough the broken fences, the milky floss of the cottonwood trees is\r\nstrewed upon the sidewalks or floats like thistledown upon the air. To\r\none sensitive to physical surroundings the change is like that from a\r\nsullen face to a smiling one, from a forbidding aspect to a cheerful\r\none. The constant bracing of one's self against the influence of one's\r\nsurroundings is relaxed: a feeling of relief and contentment comes\r\ninstead. Our thirst for picturesque beauty may not be satisfied, but we\r\naccept with thankful hearts the quiet loveliness of spring. In this, as\r\nin deeper experiences, we learn that\r\n\r\n    At best we gain not happiness,\r\n    But peace, friends--peace in the strife.\r\n\r\nLOUISE COFFIN JONES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA FORGOTTEN AMERICAN WORTHY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pleasant agricultural village of Reading, in Fairfield county,\r\nWestern Connecticut, presents much that is charming and picturesque in\r\nscenery, and is withal replete with historic incidents; but its chief\r\nclaim to interest rests on the fact that it was the birthplace of Joel\r\nBarlow, who has decided claims to the distinction of being the father of\r\nAmerican letters. Nearly seventy years have passed since the poet's\r\ntragic death, and the story of his life is still untold, while his\r\nmemory has nearly faded from the minds of the living; nor would it be\r\neasy, at this late day, to collect sufficient material for an extended\r\nbiography if such were demanded. Some pleasant traditions still linger\r\nin the sleepy atmosphere of his native village; a few of his letters and\r\npapers still remain in his family; contemporary newspapers had much to\r\nsay both for and against him; the reviewers of his day noticed his\r\npoems, sometimes with approbation, sometimes with bitterness. There are\r\nfragmentary sketches of him in encyclopædias and biographical\r\ndictionaries, and several pigeonholes in the State Department are filled\r\nwith musty documents written by him when abroad in his country's\r\ndiplomatic service. From these sources alone is the scholar of our times\r\nto glean his knowledge of one who in his day filled as large a space in\r\nthe public eye as almost any of his contemporaries, and whose talents,\r\nvirtues and public services entitled him to as lasting a fame as theirs.\r\n\r\nNot from any of these sources, but from the Barlow family register in\r\nthe ancient records of Fairfield, we learn that the poet was born on\r\nMarch 24, 1754, and not in 1755, as is almost universally stated by the\r\nencyclopædists. His father was Samuel Barlow, a wealthy farmer of the\r\nvillage--his mother, Elizabeth Hull, a connection of the general and\r\ncommodore of the same name who figured so prominently in the war of\r\n1812. There is little in the early career of the poet of interest to the\r\nmodern reader. He is first presented to us in the village traditions as\r\na chubby, rosy-faced boy, intent on mastering the Greek and Latin tasks\r\ndealt out to him by Parson Bartlett, the Congregational minister of the\r\nvillage, who, like many of the New England clergy of that day, added the\r\nduties of schoolmaster to those of the clergyman. In a year or two he\r\nwas placed at Moor's school for boys in Hanover, New Hampshire, and on\r\ncompleting his preparatory course he entered Dartmouth College in 1774.\r\nHis father had died the December previous, and, with the view probably\r\nof being nearer his mother and family in Reading, he left Dartmouth in\r\nhis Freshman year and was entered at Yale.\r\n\r\nBarlow's college career was marked by close application to study, and\r\nwon for him the respect and confidence of all with whom he came in\r\ncontact. During his second year the war of the Revolution broke out, but\r\nthe young poet, though an ardent patriot, clung to his books, resolutely\r\nclosing his ears to the clamor of war that invaded his sacred cloisters\r\nuntil the long summer vacation arrived. Then he threw aside books and\r\ngown and joined his four brothers in the Continental ranks, where he did\r\nyeoman's service for his country. He graduated in 1778, and signalized\r\nthe occasion by reciting an original poem called the \"Prospect of\r\nPeace,\" which, in the quaint language of one of his contemporaries,\r\ngained him \"a very pretty reputation as a poet.\"\r\n\r\nThe next year found him a chaplain in the Continental army, in the same\r\nbrigade with his friend Dwight, later renowned as the poet-president of\r\nYale College, and with Colonel Humphreys, whom we shall find associated\r\nwith him in a far different mission. The two young chaplains, not\r\ncontent with the performance of their clerical duties, wrote in\r\nconnection with Humphreys stirring patriotic lyrics that were set to\r\nmusic and sung by the soldiers around the camp-fires and on the weary\r\nmarch, and aided largely in allaying discontent and in inducing them to\r\nbear their hardships patiently.\r\n\r\nFor four years, or until the peace of 1783, Barlow continued to serve\r\nhis country in the army: he left the service as poor as when he entered\r\nit, and a second time the question of a vocation in life presented\r\nitself. He at length chose the law, but before being admitted to\r\npractice performed an act which, however foolish it may have seemed to\r\nthe worldly wise, proved to be one of the most fortunate events of his\r\nlife. Although poor and possessing none of the qualities of the\r\nsuccessful bread-winner, he united his fortunes with those of an amiable\r\nand charming young lady--Miss Ruth Baldwin of New Haven, daughter of\r\nMichael Baldwin, Esq., and sister of Hon. Abraham C. Baldwin, whom the\r\nstudent will remember as a Senator of note from Georgia. After marriage\r\nthe young husband settled in Hartford, first in the study, and later in\r\nthe practice, of the law. In Hartford we find him assuming the duties of\r\nlawyer, journalist and bookseller, and in all proving the truth of the\r\nfact often noted, that the possession of literary talent generally\r\nunfits one for the rough, every-day work of the world. As a lawyer\r\nBarlow lacked the smoothness and suavity of the practised advocate,\r\nwhile the petty details and trickeries of the profession disgusted him.\r\nAs an editor he made his journal, the _American Mercury_, notable for\r\nthe high literary and moral excellence of its articles, but it was not\r\nsuccessful financially, simply because it lacked a constituency\r\nsufficiently cultured to appreciate and sustain it. His bookstore, which\r\nstood on the quiet, elm-shaded main street of the then provincial\r\nvillage, was opened to dispose of his psalm-book and poems, and was\r\nclosed when this was accomplished.\r\n\r\nAs a poet, however, he was more successful, and it was here that the\r\nassurance of literary ability, so dear to the heart of the neophyte,\r\nfirst came to him. Dr. Watts's \"imitation\" of the Psalms, incomplete and\r\ninappropriate in many respects, was then the only version within reach\r\nof the Puritan churches, and in 1785 the Congregational Association of\r\nConnecticut applied to the poet for a revised edition of the work.\r\nBarlow readily complied, and published his revision the same year,\r\nadding to it several psalms which Dr. Watts had omitted. This work was\r\nreceived with marked favor by the Congregational churches, and was used\r\nby them exclusively until rumors of the author's lapse from orthodoxy\r\nreached them, when it was superseded by a version prepared by Dr.\r\nDwight.\r\n\r\nTwo years after, in 1787, Barlow published his _Vision of Columbus_, a\r\npoem conceived while in the army and largely written during the poet's\r\nsummer vacations at Reading. It was received with unbounded favor by his\r\npatriotic countrymen, and after passing through several editions at\r\nhome was republished both in London and Paris, and made its author the\r\nbest known American in the literary circles of his day. There was in\r\nHartford at this time a coterie of literary spirits whose sprightliness\r\nand bonhomie had gained for them the sobriquet of the \"Hartford Wits.\"\r\nDr. Lemuel Hopkins was doubtless the chief factor in the organization of\r\nthis club: Barlow, John Trumbull, Colonel Humphreys, Richard Alsop and\r\nTheodore Dwight--all of whom had gained literary distinction--were its\r\nchief members. The principal publications of the club were the\r\n_Anarchiad_, a satirical poem, and the _Echo_, which consisted of a\r\nseries of papers in verse lampooning the social and political follies of\r\nthe day. To both of these, it is said, Barlow was a prominent\r\ncontributor. He was also a prominent figure in the organization, about\r\nthis time, of the Connecticut Cincinnati, a society formed by\r\nRevolutionary officers for urging upon Congress their claims for\r\nservices rendered in the Revolution.\r\n\r\nIn these varied pursuits and amid such pleasant associations three years\r\npassed away, but during all this time the grim spectre of Want had\r\nmenaced the poet--first at a distance, but with each succeeding month\r\napproaching nearer and nearer, until now, in 1788, it stared him in the\r\nface. His patrimony had been nearly exhausted in his education; his\r\nlaw-business was unremunerative; his paper, as we have said, was not a\r\nsuccess financially; and his poetry brought him much more honor than\r\ncash. And thus it happened that at the age of thirty-four he found\r\nhimself without money or employment. At this trying juncture there came\r\nfrom the West--fruitful parent of such schemes!--the prospectus of the\r\nScioto Land Company, furnished with glaring head-lines and seductive\r\nphrases, and parading in its list of stockholders scores of the\r\nbest-known names in the community. This company claimed to have become\r\nthe fortunate possessor of unnumbered acres in the valley of the Scioto,\r\nand was anxious to share its good fortune--for a consideration--with\r\nEastern and European capitalists. It was desirous of securing an agent\r\nto negotiate its sales in Europe, and, quite naturally, its choice fell\r\non Joel Barlow, the only American having a reputation abroad who was at\r\nliberty to undertake the mission; and, since the company bore a good\r\nrepute and offered fair remuneration, the poet very gladly embraced its\r\noffer. He does not seem to have met with much success in England, but in\r\nFrance his reception was much more encouraging. An estate in the New\r\nWorld was a veritable _château en Espagne_ to the mercurial Frenchmen,\r\nand they purchased with some avidity; but just as the agent's ground was\r\nprepared for a plenteous harvest news came that the Scioto Company had\r\nburst, as bubbles will, leaving to its dupes only a number of\r\nwell-executed maps, some worthless parchments called deeds, and that\r\nvaluable experience which comes with a knowledge of the ways of the\r\nworld. Barlow, being the company's principal agent abroad, came in for\r\nhis full share of the abuse excited by its operations; and yet it is\r\nevident that he was as innocent of its real character as any one, and\r\nthat he had accepted the position of agent with full confidence in the\r\ncompany's integrity. Its collapse left him as poor as ever, and a\r\nstranger in a strange land, notwithstanding he was surrounded here by\r\nconditions that assured him the generous and honorable career which had\r\nbeen denied him in the New World.\r\n\r\nOf the foreigners who then thronged cosmopolitan Paris, none were so\r\npopular as Americans. Benjamin Franklin and Silas Deane, by their\r\ncourtesy and dignity, joined to republican simplicity, had provided\r\npassports for their countrymen to the good graces of all Frenchmen:\r\nbesides, the name \"republican\" was a word of magic import in France at\r\nthat time. Barlow's reputation as a poet was also of great service to\r\nhim at a time when literature exercised a commanding influence both in\r\nsociety and politics. He was presented at court, admitted to the\r\ncompanionship of wits and savants, and was enabled, by the favor of some\r\nfinancial magnates, to participate in speculations which proved so\r\nsuccessful that in a short time he was raised above the pressure of\r\nwant. But in less than a year after his arrival the Revolution broke\r\nout, and involved him in its horrors. His sympathies were entirely with\r\nthe Girondists--the party of the literati, and the most patriotic and\r\nenlightened of the rival factions. He is said to have entered heartily\r\ninto the advocacy of their cause, writing pamphlets and addresses in\r\ntheir interest and contributing frequently to their journals: he is also\r\nsaid to have figured prominently at the meetings of the Girondist\r\nleaders held in the salon of Madame Roland. The atrocities of the\r\nJacobins, however, so shocked and disgusted him that he shortly withdrew\r\nand went into retirement outside of the city. The greater part of the\r\nyears 1791-92 he spent in England, with occasional visits to France.\r\nDuring one of these visits the privileges of French citizenship were\r\nconferred on him--an honor that had been previously conferred on but two\r\nAmericans, Washington and Hamilton.\r\n\r\nIn 1795 a crisis in his fortunes occurred, and from this date the story\r\nof his life becomes an interesting and important one. He had been for\r\nsome months on a business-tour through the northern provinces, and,\r\nreturning to Paris early in September, was surprised at receiving a\r\nvisit from his old friend Colonel David Humphreys, who had been American\r\nminister to Portugal for some years, and was now in Paris on a political\r\nmission. He was accompanied on this visit by James Monroe, then American\r\nminister at the French court. They bore a commission from President\r\nWashington naming Barlow consul at Algiers, and their object was to\r\ninduce him to accept the appointment. The post was one of extreme\r\ndifficulty and danger, and had Barlow consulted his own wishes and\r\ninterests he would undoubtedly have declined it. But by appeals to his\r\nphilanthropy, and by representations that from his knowledge of courts\r\nand experience of the world he was well fitted for the performance of\r\nthe duties assigned to him, he was at length induced to accept the\r\ncommission. Preparations were at once made for the journey. His\r\nbusiness-affairs were arranged and his will made: then, bidding his wife\r\nfarewell, he set out with Humphreys on the 12th of September, 1795, for\r\nLisbon, _en route_ for the Barbary coast.\r\n\r\nAt the time of Barlow's mission Algiers was at the height of its power\r\nand arrogance. Great Britain, France, Spain, Holland, Denmark, Sweden\r\nand Venice were tributaries of this barbarous state, which waged\r\nsuccessful war with Russia, Austria, Portugal, Naples, Sardinia, Genoa\r\nand Malta. Its first depredation on American commerce was committed on\r\nthe 25th of July, 1785, when the schooner Maria, Stevens master, owned\r\nin Boston, was seized off Cape St. Vincent by a corsair and carried into\r\nAlgiers. Five days later the ship Dauphin of Philadelphia, Captain\r\nO'Brien, was taken and carried into the same port. Other captures\r\nquickly followed, so that at the time of Barlow's mission there were one\r\nhundred and twenty American citizens in the Algerine prisons, exclusive\r\nof some forty that had been liberated by death or ransomed through the\r\nprivate exertions of their friends.\r\n\r\nThe course pursued by Congress for the liberation of these captives\r\ncannot be viewed with complacency even at this late day. After some\r\nhesitation it decided to ransom the prisoners, and proceeded to\r\nnegotiate--first, through Mr. John Lamb, its agent at Algiers, and\r\nsecondly through the general of the Mathurins, a religious order of\r\nFrance instituted in early times for the redemption of Christian\r\ncaptives from the infidel powers. These negotiations extended through a\r\nperiod of six years, and accomplished nothing, from the fact that the\r\ndey invariably demanded double the sum which Congress thought it could\r\nafford to pay. In June, 1792, with the hope of negotiating a treaty and\r\nrescuing the captives, the celebrated John Paul Jones was appointed\r\nconsul to Algiers, but died before reaching the scene of his mission.\r\nHis successor, Mr. Thomas Barclay, died at Lisbon January 19, 1793,\r\nwhile on his way to Algiers. The conduct of Barbary affairs was next\r\nconfided to Colonel Humphreys, our minister to Portugal, with power to\r\nname an agent who should act under him, and Mr. Pierre E. Skjoldebrand,\r\na brother of the Swedish consul, was appointed under this arrangement;\r\nbut the latter gentleman seems to have been no more successful than his\r\npredecessors. Late in 1794, Humphreys returned to America, and while\r\nhere it was arranged that Joseph Donaldson should accompany him on his\r\nreturn as agent for Tunis and Tripoli, while Barlow, it was hoped, could\r\nbe induced to accept the mission to Algiers and the general oversight of\r\nBarbary affairs.\r\n\r\nThe two diplomats left America early in April, 1795, and proceeded to\r\nGibraltar, where they separated, Donaldson continuing his journey to\r\nAlgiers _viâ_ Alicant, and Humphreys hastening on to Paris in search of\r\nBarlow, as has been narrated. Colonel Humphreys and Mr. Barlow did not\r\nreach Lisbon until the 17th of November, and when the latter was about\r\nprosecuting his journey he was surprised by a visit from Captain\r\nO'Brien, who had been despatched by Mr. Donaldson with a newly-signed\r\ntreaty with Algiers. Mr. Donaldson, it was learned, had reached Algiers\r\non the 3d of September, and finding the dey in a genial mood had\r\nforthwith concluded a treaty with him, considering that he had\r\nsufficient authority for this under the general instructions of Colonel\r\nHumphreys. It was found that some of the conditions of the treaty could\r\nnot be fulfilled, particularly one stipulating that the first payment of\r\nnearly eight hundred thousand dollars should be made by the 5th of\r\nJanuary, 1796; and Barlow therefore hastened forward to Algiers to\r\nexplain the matter to the dey and make such attempts at pacification as\r\nwere practicable, while Captain O'Brien was sent to London in the brig\r\nSophia for the money. Of his life in Algiers, and of the subsequent fate\r\nof the treaty, some particulars are given in a letter from Barlow to\r\nHumphreys, dated at Algiers April 5, 1796, and also in a letter to Mrs.\r\nBarlow written about the same time. The letter to Humphreys is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"SIR: We have now what we hope will be more agreeable news to you. For\r\ntwo days past we have been witnesses to a scene of as complete and\r\npoignant distress as can be imagined, arising from the total state of\r\ndespair in which our captives found themselves involved, and we without\r\nthe power of administering the least comfort or hope. The threat of\r\nsending us away had been reiterated with every mark of a fixed and final\r\ndecision, and the dey went so far as to declare that after the thirty\r\ndays, if the money did not come, he never would be at peace with the\r\nAmericans. Bacri the Jew, who has as much art in this sort of management\r\nas any man we ever knew, who has more influence with the dey than all\r\nthe regency put together, and who alone has been able to soothe his\r\nimpatience on this subject for three months past, now seemed unable to\r\nmake the least impression, and the dey finally forbade him, under pain\r\nof his highest displeasure, to speak to him any more about the\r\nAmericans. His cruisers are now out, and for some days past he has been\r\noccupied with his new war against the Danes. Three days ago the Danish\r\nprizes began to come in, and it was thought that this circumstance might\r\nput him in good-humor, so that the Jew might find a chance of renewing\r\nour subject in some shape or other; and we instructed the Jew that if he\r\ncould engage him in conversation on his cruisers and prizes he might\r\noffer him a new American-built ship of twenty guns which should sail\r\nvery fast, to be presented to his daughter, on condition that he would\r\nwait six months longer for our money. The Jew observed that we had\r\nbetter say a ship of twenty-four guns, to which we agreed. After seeing\r\nhim three or four times yesterday under pretence of other business,\r\nwithout being able to touch upon this, he went this morning and\r\nsucceeded.\r\n\r\n\"The novelty of the proposition gained the dey's attention for a moment,\r\nand he consented to see us on the subject; but he told the Jew to tell\r\nus that it must be a ship of thirty-six guns or he would not listen to\r\nthe proposition. We were convinced that we ought not to hesitate an\r\ninstant. We accordingly went and assented to his demand, and he has\r\nagreed to let everything remain as it is for the term of three months\r\nfrom this day, but desired us to remember that not a single day beyond\r\nthat will be allowed on any account.\r\n\r\n\"We consider the business as now settled on this footing, and it is the\r\nbest ground that we could possibly place it upon. You still have it in\r\nyour power to say peace or no peace: you have an alternative. In the\r\nother case war was inevitable, and there would have been no hope of\r\npeace during the reign of this dey....\r\n\r\n\"In order to save the treaty, which has been the subject of infinite\r\nanxiety and vexation, we found it necessary some time ago to make an\r\noffer to the Jew of ten thousand sequins (eighteen thousand dollars), to\r\nbe paid eventually if he succeeded, and to be distributed by him among\r\nsuch great officers of state as he thought necessary, and as much of it\r\nto be kept for himself as he could keep consistent with success. The\r\nwhole of this new arrangement will cost the United States about\r\nfifty-three thousand dollars. We expect to incur blame, because it is\r\nimpossible to give you a complete view of the circumstances, but we are\r\nperfectly confident of having acted right.\"\r\n\r\nA few weeks later the long-expected ransom arrived: the prison-doors\r\nwere thrown open, and the captives came out into the sunlight. How\r\npitifully the poet-diplomatist received them, how tenderly he cared for\r\ntheir wants, and how he exerted himself to secure for them a speedy\r\npassage to their native land, may be inferred from the character of the\r\nman. Having now accomplished the object of his mission, it was to be\r\nexpected that he would be free to give up his unpleasant post and return\r\nto France. But in the adjacent states of Tunis and Tripoli there were\r\nother prisons in which American citizens were confined, and until they\r\nwere liberated he does not seem to have considered his mission as fully\r\nperformed. Six months or more were spent in effecting this object, and\r\nwhen it was accomplished he very gladly delivered up his credentials to\r\nthe government and returned to his home and friends in France.\r\n\r\nThe succeeding eight years were spent in congenial pursuits, chiefly of\r\na literary and philanthropic character. He purchased the large hôtel of\r\nthe count Clermont Tonnere, near Paris, which he transformed into an\r\nelegant villa: here he lived during his residence in France, dispensing\r\na broad hospitality and enjoying the friendship of the leading minds of\r\nthe Empire, as well as the companionship of all Americans of note who\r\nvisited the capital. But at length, in 1805, after seventeen years of\r\nabsence, the home-longing which sooner or later comes to every exile\r\nseized upon him, and, yielding to its influence, he disposed of his\r\nestates in France and with his faithful wife embarked for America.\r\n\r\nGreat changes had occurred in his native land during these seventeen\r\nyears. Washington was gone, and with him the power and prestige of\r\nFederalism; Jefferson and Burr had led the Republican hosts to victory;\r\nPresbyterianism as a political force was dead; and everywhere in society\r\nthe old order was giving place to the new. This was more markedly the\r\ncase in New England, where the Puritan crust was being broken and\r\npulverized by the gradual upheaval of the Republican strata. Withal, it\r\nwas an era of intense political feeling and of partisan bitterness\r\nwithout a parallel.\r\n\r\nThis will explain, perhaps, the varying manner in which Barlow was\r\nreceived by the different parties among his countrymen. The Republicans\r\ngreeted him with acclamation as the honored citizen of two republics,\r\nthe man who had perilled life and health in rescuing his countrymen from\r\nslavery. The Federalists, on the other hand, united in traducing him--an\r\nassertion which may be gainsaid, but which can be abundantly proved by\r\nreference to the Federal newspapers and magazines of the day. In\r\nevidence, and as a curious instance of the political bitterness of the\r\ntimes, I will adduce the following article from the _Boston Repertory_,\r\nprinted in the August after the poet's return:\r\n\r\n     \"JEFFERSON, BARLOW AND PAINE.\r\n\r\n     \"In our last paper was announced, and that with extreme\r\n     regret, the return of Joel Barlow, Esq., to this country.\r\n     This man, the strong friend of Mr. Jefferson and\r\n     confidential companion of his late warm defender, Tom Paine,\r\n     is one of the most barefaced infidels that ever appeared in\r\n     Christendom. Some facts respecting these distinguished\r\n     personages may serve to show the votaries of Christianity\r\n     what a band of open enemies (to the faith) is now assembling\r\n     in this country.\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Jefferson, in his famous _Notes on Virginia_, advances\r\n     opinions incompatible with Mosaic history. This cannot be\r\n     disputed, nor will Mr. Jefferson dare to deny that he has,\r\n     since he has been President of the United States, publicly\r\n     made the Eucharist a subject of impious ridicule. Tom Paine\r\n     has written two books for the express purpose of combating\r\n     the Holy Scriptures. His _Age of Reason_ is but too common,\r\n     and his letter to the late Samuel Adams still evinces his\r\n     perverse adherence to his infidel system.\r\n\r\n     \"Joel Barlow is said to have written the following shocking\r\n     letter to his correspondent, John Fellows, dated Hamburg,\r\n     May 23, 1805: 'I rejoice at the progress of good sense over\r\n     the _damnable imposture_ of _Christian mummery_. I had no\r\n     doubt of the effect of Paine's _Age of Reason_: it may be\r\n     cavilled at a while, but it must prevail. Though things as\r\n     good have been often said, they were never said in so good a\r\n     way,' etc. Mr. Barlow can now answer for himself: if this\r\n     letter be a forgery, let him inform the public. It has never\r\n     yet been contradicted, though it has been four years\r\n     published in America.\"\r\n\r\nFrom which we gather that in the political code of that day the grossest\r\ncalumnies if uncontradicted were to be accepted as truth. There is not\r\nthe slightest evidence, however, in his writings or public utterances\r\nthat the poet ever renounced the faith of his fathers, although it is\r\nnot probable that he was a very strict Presbyterian at this time.\r\n\r\nBarlow seems not to have returned with any hopes of political\r\npreferment: at least he made no attempt to enter the field of politics,\r\nbut after spending several months in travel took up his residence in\r\nWashington and devoted himself to philosophical studies and the\r\ncultivation of the Muses. He had purchased a beautiful site on the banks\r\nof the Potomac within the city limits, and here he erected a mansion\r\nwhose beauty and elegance made it famous throughout the country. This\r\nmansion he called Kalorama, and the wealth and correct taste of its\r\nowner were lavishly employed in its adornment. Broad green lawns, shaded\r\nby forest trees, surrounded the house, fountains sparkled and gleamed\r\namid the shrubberies, and gay parterres of flowers added their beauty to\r\nthe scene. Within, French carpets, mirrors, statuary, pictures and\r\nbric-à-brac betokened the foreign tastes of the owner. In the library\r\nwas gathered the most extensive private collection of foreign books\r\nwhich the country then contained. Kalorama was the Holland House of\r\nAmerica, where were to be met all the notables of the land, political,\r\nliterary or philanthropic. The President, heads of departments,\r\nCongressmen, foreign ambassadors, poets, authors, reformers, inventors,\r\nwere all to be seen there. Robert Fulton, the father of\r\nsteam-navigation, was the poet's firm friend, and received substantial\r\naid from him in his enterprise. Jefferson, throwing off the cares of\r\nstate, often paid him informal visits, and the two sages had a pet plan\r\nwhich was generally the subject of conversation on these occasions. This\r\nwas the scheme of a national university, to be modelled after the\r\nInstitute of France, and to combine a university, a learned society, a\r\nnaval and military school and an academy of fine arts. The movement had\r\nbeen originated by Washington, and Jefferson and Barlow, with many other\r\nleading men of the day, were its warm friends and promoters. In 1806,\r\nBarlow, at Jefferson's suggestion, drew up a prospectus, which was\r\nprinted and circulated throughout the country. So great a public\r\nsentiment in favor of the scheme was developed that a bill for its\r\nendowment was shortly after introduced in Congress; but New England\r\nexerted her influence against it in favor of Yale and Harvard so\r\nsuccessfully that it was defeated.\r\n\r\nThe chief literary work which occupied the poet in this classic retreat\r\nwas _The Columbiad_, which appeared in 1808. He also busied himself with\r\ncollecting materials for a general history of the United States--a work\r\nwhich, if he had been permitted to finish it, would have proved no doubt\r\na valuable contribution to this department of literature. But in the\r\nmidst of this scholarly retirement he was surprised at receiving a note\r\nfrom Mr. Monroe, then Secretary of State, offering him the position of\r\nminister to France, and urging his acceptance of it in the strongest\r\nterms.\r\n\r\nOur relations with France were then (1811) in a very critical state,\r\nowing to the latter's repeated attacks on American commerce, and it was\r\nof vital moment to the government that a man so universally respected by\r\nthe French people, and so familiar with the French court and its circle\r\nof wily diplomats, as was Barlow, should have charge of American\r\ninterests in that quarter. A man less unselfish, less patriotic, would\r\nhave refused the burden of such a position, especially one so foreign to\r\nhis tastes and desires; but the poet in this case, as in 1795, seems not\r\nto have hesitated an instant at the call of his country. Kalorama was\r\nclosed--not sold, for its owner hoped that his absence would not be of\r\nlong duration--preparations for the journey were speedily made, and\r\nearly in August, 1811, Barlow, accompanied by his faithful wife, was set\r\ndown at the port of Annapolis, where the famous frigate Constitution,\r\nCaptain Hull, had been lying for some time in readiness to receive him.\r\nIn Annapolis the poet was received with distinguished honor: at his\r\nembarkation crowds thronged the quay, and a number of distinguished\r\ncitizens were gathered at the gang-plank to bid him God-speed on his\r\njourney. Captain Hull received his guest with the honor due his\r\nstation: then the Constitution spread her sails, and, gay with bunting\r\nand responding heartily to the salutes from the forts on shore, swept\r\ngallantly down the bay and out to sea. The beautiful city, gleaming amid\r\nthe foliage of its stately forest trees, and the low level shores, green\r\nwith orchards and growing corn, were the last objects that the poet\r\nbeheld ere the outlines of his native land sank beneath the waters.\r\nHappily, he could not foresee the untimely death in waiting for him not\r\neighteen months distant, nor the lonely sepulchre in the Polish waste,\r\nnor the still more bitter fact that ere two generations should pass an\r\nungrateful country would entirely forget his services and martyrdom.\r\n\r\nBarlow's correspondence with Mr. Monroe and the duke de Bassano while\r\nabroad on this mission forms an interesting and hitherto unpublished\r\nchapter in our history. It has rested undisturbed in the pigeonholes of\r\nthe State Department for nearly a century, and if published in\r\nconnection with a brief memoir of the poet would prove a valuable\r\naddition to our annals. The first of the series is Mr. Monroe's letter\r\nof instruction to the newly-appointed minister, defining the objects of\r\nhis mission, which were, in brief, indemnity for past spoliations and\r\nsecurity from further depredations. The second paper is Mr. Barlow's\r\nfirst letter from Paris, under date of September 29, 1811, and is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"I seize the first occasion to announce to you my arrival, though I have\r\nlittle else to announce. I landed at Cherbourg the 8th of this month,\r\nand arrived at Paris the 19th. The emperor has been residing for some\r\ntime at Compiègne, and it unluckily happened that he set out thence for\r\nthe coast and for Holland the day of my arrival here. The duke de\r\nBassano, Minister of Foreign Relations, came the next day to Paris for\r\ntwo days only, when he was to follow the emperor to join him in Holland.\r\nGeneral Turreau and others, who called on me the morning after I reached\r\nParis, assured me that the duke was desirous of seeing me as soon as\r\npossible and with as little ceremony.\r\n\r\n\"On the 21st I made my first visit to him, which of course had no other\r\nobject than that of delivering my credentials. I expressed my regret at\r\nthe emperor's absence, and the consequent delay of such business as was\r\nrendered particularly urgent by the necessity of sending home the\r\nfrigate and by the approaching session of Congress, as well as by the\r\ndistressed situation of those American citizens who were awaiting the\r\nresult of decisions which might be hastened by the expositions I was\r\ncharged to make on the part of the President of the United States. He\r\nsaid the emperor had foreseen the urgency of the case, and had charged\r\nhim to remedy the evil, as far as could be done, by dispensing with my\r\npresentation to His Majesty till his return, and that I might\r\nimmediately proceed to business as if I had been presented. He said the\r\nmost flattering things from the emperor relative to my appointment. He\r\nobserved that His Majesty had expected my arrival with some solicitude,\r\nand was disposed to do everything that I could reasonably ask to\r\nmaintain a good intelligence between the two countries.... I explained\r\nto him with as much precision as possible the sentiments of the\r\nPresident on the most pressing objects of my mission, and threw in such\r\nobservations as seemed to arise out of what I conceived to be the true\r\ninterests of France. He heard me with patience and apparent solicitude,\r\nendeavored to explain away some of the evils of which we complain, and\r\nexpressed a strong desire to explain away the rest. He said that many of\r\nthe ideas I suggested were new to him, and were very important--that he\r\nshould lay them before the emperor with fidelity and in a manner\r\ncalculated to produce the most favorable impression; desired me to\r\nreduce them to writing, to be presented in a more solemn form; and\r\nendeavored to convince me that he doubted not our being able on the\r\nreturn of the emperor to remove all obstacles to a most perfect harmony\r\nbetween the two countries.\"\r\n\r\nIn a letter dated December 19, 1811, he writes:\r\n\r\n\"Since the date of my last I have had many interviews with the Minister\r\nof Foreign Relations. I have explained several points, and urged every\r\nargument for as speedy an answer to my note of the 10th as its very\r\nserious importance would allow. He always treats the subject with\r\napparent candor and solicitude, seems anxious to gain information, and\r\ndeclares that neither he nor the emperor had before understood American\r\naffairs, and always assures me that he is nearly ready with his answer.\r\nBut he says the emperor's taking so long a time to consider it and make\r\nup his decision is not without reason, for it opens a wide field for\r\nmeditation on very interesting matters. He says the emperor has read the\r\nnote repeatedly and with great attention--that he told him the reasoning\r\nin it was everywhere just and the conclusions undeniable, but to\r\nreconcile its principles with his continental system presented\r\ndifficulties not easy to remove. From what the emperor told me himself\r\nat the last diplomatic audience, and from a variety of hints and other\r\ncircumstances remarked among the people about his person, I have been\r\nmade to believe that he is really changing his system relative to our\r\ntrade, and that the answer to my note will be more satisfactory than I\r\nhad at first expected.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral other letters from the poet to Monroe follow, all of the same\r\ngeneral tenor--complaining of delay, yet hopeful that the treaty would\r\nshortly be secured. February 8, 1812, he writes to the Secretary of\r\nState that the duke is \"at work upon the treaty, and probably in good\r\nearnest, but the discussions with Russia and the other affairs of this\r\nContinent give him and the emperor so much occupation that I cannot\r\ncount upon their getting on very fast with ours.\"\r\n\r\nAmid these delays the summer passed away, and the emperor, intent on\r\nmapping out his great campaign against Russia, still neglected to sign\r\nthe important instrument. Early in the summer Napoleon left Paris for\r\nWilna to take command of the vast armies that had been collected for the\r\ninvasion, and from that place, on the 11th of October, the duke de\r\nBassano addressed the following note to Mr. Barlow in Paris:\r\n\r\n\"SIR: I have had the honor to make known to you how much I regretted, in\r\nthe negotiation commenced between the United States and France, the\r\ndelays which inevitably attended a correspondence carried on at so great\r\na distance. Your government has desired to see the epoch of this\r\narrangement draw near: His Majesty is animated by the same dispositions,\r\nand, willing to assure to the negotiation a result the most prompt, he\r\nhas thought that it would be expedient to suppress the intermediaries\r\nand to transfer the conference to Wilna. His Majesty has in consequence\r\nauthorized me, sir, to treat directly with you; and if you will come to\r\nthis town I dare hope that, with the desire which animates us both to\r\nconciliate such important interests, we shall immediately be enabled to\r\nremove all the difficulties which until now have appeared to impede the\r\nprogress of the negotiation. I have apprised the duke of Dalberg that\r\nhis mission was thus terminated, and I have laid before His Majesty the\r\nactual state of the negotiation, to the end that when you arrive at\r\nWilna, the different questions being already illustrated either by your\r\njudicious observation or by the instructions I shall have received, we\r\nmay, sir, conclude an arrangement so desirable and so conformable to the\r\nmutually amicable views of our two governments.\"\r\n\r\nBarlow could do no less than comply with this invitation, since, as he\r\nremarked in a letter to Monroe under date of October 25, \"it was\r\nimpossible to refuse it without giving offence.\" His letter accepting\r\nthe duke's invitation was probably the last ever written by him, and is\r\ndated Paris, October 25, 1812:\r\n\r\n\"SIR: In consequence of the letter you did me the honor to write me on\r\nthe 11th of this month, I accept your invitation, and leave Paris\r\nto-morrow for Wilna, where I hope to arrive in fifteen or eighteen days\r\nfrom this date. The negotiation on which you have done me the honor to\r\ninvite me at Wilna is so completely prepared in all its parts between\r\nthe duke of Dalberg and myself, and, as I understand, sent on to you for\r\nyour approbation about the 18th of the present month, that I am\r\npersuaded that if it could have arrived before the date of your letter\r\nthe necessity of this meeting would not have existed, as I am confident\r\nHis Majesty would have found the project reasonable and acceptable in\r\nall its parts, and would have ordered that minister to conclude and sign\r\nboth the treaty of commerce and the convention of indemnities.\"\r\n\r\nBarlow left Paris for Wilna on the 26th of October in his private\r\ncarriage, yet travelling night and day and with relays of horses at the\r\npost-towns to expedite his progress. His sole companion was his nephew\r\nand secretary of legation, Thomas Barlow, who had been educated and\r\ngiven an honorable position in life through the poet's munificence.\r\nTheir route, the same as that pursued by Napoleon a few weeks before,\r\nled across the Belgian frontiers and through the forests and defiles of\r\nthe German principalities. Once across the Niemen, they met with rumors\r\nof the emperor's disaster at Moscow, and that portions of his army were\r\nthen in full retreat, but, discrediting them, pushed on to Wilna, which\r\nthey reached about the 1st of December. Wilna is the only considerable\r\nvillage in Russia between the Niemen and Moscow: it is a quaint and\r\nvenerable town, capital of the ancient province of Lithuania, and played\r\nan important part in Napoleon's Russian campaign, being the rendezvous\r\nof his legions after crossing the Niemen and the site of his\r\narmy-hospitals. When our travellers entered it, it was filled with a\r\nhorde of panic-stricken fugitives, who made the town a temporary\r\nresting-place before continuing their flight to the frontiers; nor were\r\nthey long in learning the, to them, distressing news that the French\r\narmy was in swift retreat, and that the duke de Bassano, so far from\r\nbeing at leisure to attend a diplomatic conference at Wilna, was then on\r\nthe frontiers hurrying forward reinforcements to cover the retreat of\r\nhis emperor across the Beresina.\r\n\r\nThe perilous journey had been made in vain, and the treaty was doomed to\r\nstill further delay. It now only remained for Barlow to extricate\r\nhimself from his dangerous position and to reach the frontiers before\r\nthe fleeing army and the pursuing Cossacks should close every avenue of\r\nescape.\r\n\r\nThomas Barlow on his return to America sometimes favored his friends\r\nwith vivid pictures of the sufferings and privations endured by the\r\ntravellers in their flight from Wilna. The passage of so many men had\r\nrendered the roads well-nigh impassable; food, even of the meanest kind,\r\ncould only be procured with the greatest difficulty; and often the\r\ntravellers were mixed up with the flying masses, as it seemed\r\ninextricably. Ruined habitations, wagons and provision-vans overturned\r\nand pillaged, men dying by scores from hunger and starvation, and frozen\r\ncorpses of men and horses, were objects that constantly presented\r\nthemselves. At length they crossed the Niemen and pursued their journey\r\nthrough Poland, still suffering terribly from the cold and from the\r\ninsufficient nature of the food obtainable; but on reaching Zarrow,[C]\r\nan obscure village near Cracow, the poet was seized with a sudden and\r\nfatal attack of pneumonia, the result, no doubt, of privation and\r\nexposure. He was borne to a little Jewish cottage, the only inn that the\r\nvillage afforded, and there died December 26, 1812. His remains were\r\ninterred in the little churchyard of the village where he died. It is\r\nrarely that an American visits his grave, and the government has never\r\ntaken interest enough in its minister to erect a memorial slab above his\r\ndust; but wifely devotion has supplied the omission, and a plain\r\nmonument of marble, on which are inscribed his name, age and station and\r\nthe circumstances of his death, marks the poet's place of sepulture.\r\n\r\nThe news of his death seems not to have reached the United States until\r\nthe succeeding March. The Federal journals merely announced the fact\r\nwithout comment: the Republican papers published formal eulogiums on the\r\ndead statesman. President Madison, in his inaugural of 1813, thus\r\nreferred to the event: \"The sudden death of the distinguished citizen\r\nwho represented the United States in France, without any special\r\narrangement by him for such a conclusion, has kept us without the\r\nexpected sequel to his last communications; nor has the French\r\ngovernment taken any measures for bringing the depending negotiations to\r\na conclusion through its representative in the United States.\"\r\n\r\nIn France the poet's demise excited a more general feeling of regret,\r\nperhaps, than in his own country. A formal eulogy on his life and\r\ncharacter was pronounced by Dupont de Nemours before the Society for the\r\nEncouragement of National Industry, and the year succeeding his death an\r\naccount of his life and writings was published at Paris in quarto form,\r\naccompanied by one canto of _The Columbiad_, translated into French\r\nheroic verse. The American residents of Paris also addressed a letter of\r\ncondolence to Mrs. Barlow, in which is apparent the general sentiment of\r\nrespect and affection entertained for the poet in the French capital.\r\n\r\n\"In private life,\" says one of his eulogists, \"Mr. Barlow was highly\r\nesteemed for his amiable temperament and many social excellences. His\r\nmanners were generally grave and dignified, and he possessed but little\r\nfacility of general conversation, but with his intimate friends he was\r\neasy and familiar, and upon topics which deeply interested him he\r\nconversed with much animation.\"\r\n\r\nAnother thus refers to his domestic relations: \"The affection of Mr.\r\nBarlow for his lovely wife was unusually strong, and on her part it was\r\nfully reciprocated. She cheerfully in early life cast in her lot with\r\nhis 'for better or for worse'--and sometimes the worst, so far as their\r\npecuniary prospects were concerned. In their darkest days Barlow ever\r\nfound light and encouragement at home in the smiles, sympathy and\r\ncounsel of his prudent, faithful wife. No matter how dark and portentous\r\nthe cloud that brooded over them might be, she always contrived to give\r\nit a silver lining, and his subsequent success in life he always\r\nattributed more to her influence over him than to anything else.\"\r\n\r\nBarlow lived a dual life--the life of a poet as well as of a\r\ndiplomatist--and this paper can scarcely be considered complete unless\r\nit touches somewhat on his literary productions. It will be the verdict\r\nof all who study his life carefully that he was a better statesman than\r\npoet, and a better philanthropist than either; yet as a poet he\r\nsurpassed his contemporaries, producing works that fairly entitle him to\r\nthe distinction of being the father of American letters. His _Hasty\r\nPudding_ would be a valuable addition to any literature, and in his\r\n_Advice to the Privileged Orders_ and his _Conspiracy of Kings_ much\r\npoetic power and insight is apparent. It was on his epic of _The\r\nColumbiad_ that he no doubt founded his hopes of fame, but, though the\r\nbook was extensively read in its day and passed through several editions\r\non both continents, no reprint has been demanded in modern times, and it\r\nlong since dropped out of the category of books that are read.\r\n\r\nBarlow's private letters from abroad would have possessed undoubted\r\ninterest to the present generation, but, so far as is known, none of\r\nthem have been preserved--with one exception, however. There is in\r\nexistence a long letter of his, written to his wife while he was in\r\nAlgiers in imminent danger from the plague, and which was to be\r\nforwarded to her only in case of his death. It was found among his\r\npapers after his death nearly sixteen years later. This letter has\r\nalready appeared in print, but it will be new to most of our readers,\r\nand it is so remarkable in itself, and throws such light on the\r\ncharacter of the writer, that, in spite of its length, no apology is\r\nrequired for inserting it here:\r\n\r\n    \"_To Mrs. Barlow in Paris_:\r\n\r\n                                      \"ALGIERS, 8th July, 1796.\r\n\r\n     \"MY DEAREST LIFE AND ONLY LOVE: I run no risk of alarming\r\n     your extreme sensibility by writing this letter, since it is\r\n     not my intention that it shall come into your hands unless\r\n     and until, through some other channel, you shall be informed\r\n     of the event which it anticipates as possible. For our happy\r\n     union to be dissolved by death is indeed at every moment\r\n     possible; but at this time there is an uncommon degree of\r\n     danger that you may lose a life which I know you value more\r\n     than you do your own. I say I _know_ this, because I have\r\n     long been taught, from our perfect sympathy of affection, to\r\n     judge your heart by mine; and I can say solemnly and truly,\r\n     as far as I know myself, that I have no other value for my\r\n     own life than as a means of continuing a conjugal union with\r\n     the best of women--the wife of my soul, my first, my last,\r\n     my only love. I have told you in my current letters that the\r\n     plague is raging with considerable violence in this place. I\r\n     must tell you in this, if it should be your fortune to see\r\n     it, that a pressing duty of humanity requires me to expose\r\n     myself more than other considerations would justify in\r\n     endeavoring to save as many of our unhappy citizens as\r\n     possible from falling a sacrifice, and to embark them at\r\n     this cruel moment for their country. Though they are dying\r\n     very fast, it is possible that my exertions may be the means\r\n     of saving a number who otherwise would perish. If this\r\n     should be the case, and _I_ should fall instead of _them_,\r\n     my tender, generous friend must not upbraid my memory by\r\n     ever thinking I did too much. But she cannot help it: I know\r\n     she cannot. Yet, my dearest love, give me leave, since I\r\n     must anticipate your affliction, to lay before you some\r\n     reflections which would recur to you at _last_, but which\r\n     ought to strike your mind at _first_, to mingle with and\r\n     assuage your first emotions of grief. You cannot judge at\r\n     your distance of the risk I am taking, nor of the necessity\r\n     of taking it; and I am convinced that were you in my place\r\n     you would do more than I shall do, for your kind, intrepid\r\n     spirit has more courage than mine, and always had.\r\n\r\n     \"Another consideration: Many of these persons have wives at\r\n     home as well as I, from whom they have been much longer\r\n     separated, under more affecting circumstances, having been\r\n     held in a merciless and desponding slavery: if their wives\r\n     love them as mine does me (a thing I cannot believe, but\r\n     have no right to deny), ask these lately disconsolate and\r\n     now joyous families whether I have done too much.\r\n\r\n     \"Since I write this as if it were my last poor demonstration\r\n     of affection to my lovely friend, I have much to say; and it\r\n     is with difficulty that I can steal an hour from the fatigue\r\n     of business to devote to the grateful, painful task. But\r\n     tell me (you cannot tell me) where shall I begin? where\r\n     shall I end? how shall I put an eternal period to a\r\n     correspondence which has given me so much comfort? With what\r\n     expression of regret shall I take leave of my happiness?\r\n     with what words of tenderness, of gratitude, of counsel, of\r\n     consolation, shall I pay you for what I am robbing you\r\n     of--the husband whom you cherish, the friend who is all your\r\n     own?\r\n\r\n     \"But I am giving vent to more weakness than I intended:\r\n     this, my dear, is a letter of _business_, not of love, and I\r\n     wonder I cannot enter upon it and keep to my subject.\r\n     Enclosed is my last will, made in conformity to the one I\r\n     left in the hands of Doctor Hopkins of Hartford, as you may\r\n     remember. The greater part of our property now lying in\r\n     Paris, I thought proper to renew this instrument, that you\r\n     might enter immediately upon the settlement of your affairs,\r\n     without waiting to send to America for the other paper.\r\n\r\n     \"You will likewise find enclosed a schedule of our property\r\n     debts and demands, with explanations, as nearly just as I\r\n     can make it from memory in the absence of my papers. If the\r\n     French Republic is consolidated, and her funds rise to par,\r\n     or near it, as I believe they will do soon after the war,\r\n     the effects noted in this schedule may amount to a capital\r\n     of about one hundred and twenty thousand dollars, besides\r\n     paying my debts; which sum, vested in the American funds or\r\n     mortgages equally solid, would produce something more than\r\n     seven thousand dollars a year perpetual income.\r\n\r\n     \"If the French should fund their debt anew at one-half its\r\n     nominal value (which is possible), so that the part of your\r\n     property now vested in those funds should diminish in\r\n     proportion, still, taking the whole together, it will not\r\n     make a difference of more than one-third, and the annual\r\n     income may still be near five thousand dollars. Events\r\n     unforeseen by me may, however, reduce it considerably lower.\r\n     But, whatever may be the value of what I leave, it is left\r\n     simply and wholly to you.\r\n\r\n     \"Perhaps some of my relations may think it strange that I\r\n     have not mentioned them in this final disposition of my\r\n     effects, especially if they should prove to be as\r\n     considerable as I hope they may. But, my dearest love, I\r\n     will tell you my reasons, and I hope you will approve them;\r\n     for if I can excuse myself to _you_ in a point in which your\r\n     generous delicacy would be more likely to question the\r\n     propriety of my conduct than in most others, I am sure my\r\n     arguments will be convincing to those whose objections may\r\n     arise from their interest.\r\n\r\n     \"_First._ In a view of justice and equity, whatever we\r\n     possess at this moment is a joint property between\r\n     ourselves, and ought to remain to the survivor. When you\r\n     gave me your blessed self you know I was destitute of every\r\n     other possession, as of every other enjoyment: I was rich\r\n     only in the fund of your affectionate economy and the sweet\r\n     consolation of your society. In our various struggles and\r\n     disappointments while trying to obtain a moderate competency\r\n     for the quiet enjoyment of what we used to call the\r\n     remainder of our lives, I have been rendered happy by\r\n     misfortunes, for the heaviest we have met with were turned\r\n     into blessings by the opportunities they gave me to discover\r\n     new virtues in you, who taught me how to bear them.\r\n\r\n     \"I have often told you since the year 1791, the period of\r\n     our deepest difficulties (and even during that period), that\r\n     I had never been so easy and contented before; and I have\r\n     certainly been happier in you during the latter years of our\r\n     union than I was in former years; not that I have loved you\r\n     more ardently or more exclusively, for that was impossible,\r\n     but I have loved you _better_: my heart has been more full\r\n     of your excellence and less agitated with objects of\r\n     ambition, which used to devour me too much.\r\n\r\n     \"I recall these things to your mind to convince you of my\r\n     full belief that the acquisition of the competency which we\r\n     seem at last to have secured is owing more to your energy\r\n     than my own: I mean the energy of your virtues, which gave\r\n     me consolation, and even happiness, under circumstances\r\n     wherein, if I had been alone or with a partner no better\r\n     than myself, I should have sunk.\r\n\r\n     \"These fruits of our joint exertions you expected to enjoy\r\n     _with me_, else I know you would not have wished for them.\r\n     But if by my death you are to be deprived of the greater\r\n     part of the comfort you expected, it would surely be unjust\r\n     and cruel to deprive you of the remainder, or any portion of\r\n     it, by giving any part of this property to others. It is\r\n     yours in the truest sense in which property can be\r\n     considered; and I should have no right, if I were disposed,\r\n     to take it from you.\r\n\r\n     \"_Secondly._ Of _my_ relations, I have some thirty or forty,\r\n     nephews and nieces and their children, the greater part of\r\n     whom I have never seen, and from whom I have had no news for\r\n     seven or eight years. Among them there may be some\r\n     necessitous ones who would be proper objects of particular\r\n     legacies, yet it would be impossible for me at this moment\r\n     to know which they are. It was my intention, and still is if\r\n     I live, to go to America, to make discrimination among them\r\n     according to their wants, and to give them such relief as\r\n     might be in my power, without waiting to do it by legacy.\r\n     Now, my lovely wife, if this task and the means of\r\n     performing it should devolve upon you, I need not recommend\r\n     it: our _joint_ liberality would have been less extensive\r\n     and less grateful to the receivers than _yours_ will be\r\n     alone.\r\n\r\n     \"_Your own_ relations in the same degree of affinity are few\r\n     in number. I hope I need not tell you that in my affections\r\n     I know no difference between yours and mine. I include them\r\n     all in the same recommendation, without any other\r\n     distinction than what may arise from their wants and your\r\n     ability to do them good.\r\n\r\n     \"If Colonel B---- or his wife (either of them being left by\r\n     the other) should be in a situation otherwise than\r\n     comfortable, I wish my generous friend to render it so as\r\n     far as may be in her power. We may have had more powerful\r\n     friends than they, but never any more sincere. _He_ has the\r\n     most frank and loyal spirit in the world, and she is\r\n     possessed of many amiable and almost heroic virtues.\r\n\r\n     \"Mary----, poor girl!--you know her worth, her virtues, and\r\n     her talents, and I am sure you will not fail to keep\r\n     yourself informed of her circumstances. She has friends, or\r\n     at least _had_ them, more able than you will be to yield her\r\n     assistance in case of need. But they may forsake her for\r\n     reasons which to your enlightened and benevolent mind would\r\n     rather be an additional inducement to contribute to her\r\n     happiness. Excuse me, my dearest life, for my being so\r\n     particular on a subject which, considering to whom it is\r\n     addressed, may appear superfluous; but I do it rather to\r\n     show that I agree with you in these sentiments than to\r\n     pretend that they originate on my part. With this view I\r\n     must pursue them a little further. One of the principal\r\n     gratifications in which I intended, and still intend to\r\n     indulge myself if I should live to enjoy with you the means\r\n     of doing it, is to succor the unfortunate of every\r\n     description as far as possible--to encourage merit where I\r\n     find it, and try to create it where it does not exist. This\r\n     has long been a favorite project with me; but, having always\r\n     been destitute of the means of carrying it into effect to\r\n     any considerable degree, I have not conversed with you upon\r\n     it as much as I wish I had. Though I can say nothing that\r\n     will be new to you on the pleasure of employing one's\r\n     attention and resources in this way, yet some useful hints\r\n     might be given on the means of multiplying good actions from\r\n     small resources; for I would not confine my pleasure to the\r\n     simple duties of _charity_ in the beggar's sense of the\r\n     word.\r\n\r\n     \"_First._ Much may be done by advising with poor persons,\r\n     contriving for them, and pointing out the objects on which\r\n     they can employ their own industry.\r\n\r\n     \"_Secondly._ Many persons and families in a crisis of\r\n     difficulty might be extricated and set up in the world by\r\n     little loans of money, for which they might give good\r\n     security and refund within a year; and the same fund might\r\n     then go to relieve a second and a third; and thus a dozen\r\n     families might be set on the independent footing of their\r\n     own industry in the course of a dozen years by the help of\r\n     fifty dollars, and the owner lose nothing but the interest.\r\n     Some judgment would be necessary in these operations, as\r\n     well as care and attention in finding out the proper\r\n     objects. How many of these are to be found in prisons,\r\n     thrown in and confined for years, for small debts which\r\n     their industry and their liberty would enable them to\r\n     discharge in a short time! Imprisonment for debt still\r\n     exists as a stain upon our country, as most others. France,\r\n     indeed, has set us the example of abolishing it, but I am\r\n     apprehensive she will relapse from this, as I see she is\r\n     inclined to do from many other good things which she began\r\n     in her magnanimous struggle for the renovation of society.\r\n\r\n     \"_Thirdly._ With your benevolence, your character and\r\n     connections, you may put in motion a much greater fund of\r\n     charity than you will yourself possess. It is by searching\r\n     out the objects of distress or misfortune, and recommending\r\n     them to their wealthy neighbors in such a manner as to\r\n     excite their attention. I have often remarked to you (I\r\n     forget whether you agree with me in it or not) that there is\r\n     more goodness at the bottom of the human heart than the\r\n     world will generally allow. Men are as often hindered from\r\n     doing a generous thing by an _indolence_ either of thought\r\n     or action as by a selfish principle. If they knew what the\r\n     action was, when and where it was to be done and how to do\r\n     it, their obstacles would be overcome. In this manner one\r\n     may bring the resources of others into contribution, and\r\n     with such a grace as to obtain the thanks both of the givers\r\n     and receivers.\r\n\r\n     \"_Fourthly._ The _example_ of one beneficent person, like\r\n     yourself, in a neighborhood or a town would go a great way.\r\n     It would doubtless be imitated by others, extend far, and\r\n     benefit thousands whom you might never hear of.\r\n\r\n     \"I certainly hope to escape from this place and return to\r\n     your beloved arms. No man has stronger inducements to wish\r\n     to live than I have. I have no quarrel with the world: it\r\n     has used me as well as could be expected. I have valuable\r\n     friends in every country where I have put my foot, not\r\n     excepting this abominable sink of wickedness, pestilence and\r\n     folly--the city of Algiers. I have a pretty extensive and\r\n     dear-bought knowledge of mankind; a most valuable collection\r\n     of books; a pure and undivided taste for domestic\r\n     tranquillity, the social intercourse of friends, study, and\r\n     the exercise of charity. I have a moderate but sufficient\r\n     income, perfect health, an unimpaired constitution, and, to\r\n     give the relish to all enjoyments and smooth away the\r\n     asperities that might arise from unforeseen calamities, I\r\n     have the wife that my youth chose and my advancing age has\r\n     cherished--the pattern of excellence, the example of every\r\n     virtue--from whom all my joys have risen, in whom all my\r\n     hopes are centred.\r\n\r\n     \"I will use every precaution for my safety, as well for your\r\n     sake as mine. But if you should see me no more, my dearest\r\n     friend, you will not forget I loved you. As you have valued\r\n     my love, and as you believe this letter is written with an\r\n     intention to promote your happiness at a time when it will\r\n     be for ever out of my power to contribute to it in any other\r\n     way, I beg you will kindly receive the last advice I can\r\n     give you, with which I am going to close our endearing\r\n     intercourse.... Submitting with patience to a destiny that\r\n     is unavoidable, let your tenderness for me soon cease to\r\n     agitate that lovely bosom: banish it to the house of\r\n     darkness and dust, with the object that can no longer be\r\n     benefited by it, and transfer your affections to some worthy\r\n     person who shall supply my place in the relation I have\r\n     borne to you. It is for the living, not the dead, to be\r\n     rendered happy by the sweetness of your temper, the purity\r\n     of your heart, your exalted sentiments, your cultivated\r\n     spirit, your undivided love. Happy man of your choice should\r\n     he know and prize the treasure of such a wife! Oh, treat her\r\n     tenderly, my dear sir: she is used to nothing but kindness,\r\n     unbounded love and confidence. She is all that any\r\n     reasonable man can desire. She is more than I have merited,\r\n     or perhaps than you can merit. My resigning her to your\r\n     charge, though but the result of uncontrollable necessity,\r\n     is done with a degree of cheerfulness--a cheerfulness\r\n     inspired by the hope that her happiness will be the object\r\n     of your care and the long-continued fruit of your affection.\r\n\r\n     \"Farewell, my wife; and though I am not used to subscribe my\r\n     letters addressed to you, your familiarity with my writing\r\n     having always rendered it unnecessary, yet it seems proper\r\n     that the last characters which this hand shall trace for\r\n     your perusal should compose the name of your most faithful,\r\n     most affectionate and most grateful husband,\r\n\r\n    \"JOEL BARLOW.\"\r\n\r\nAfter her husband's decease Mrs. Barlow returned to America, and\r\ncontinued to reside at Kalorama until her death in 1818.\r\n\r\nCHARLES BURR TODD.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[C] The name is variously written Zarrow, Zarniwica and Zarrowitch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTERESA DI FAENZA.\r\n\r\n\r\n    I.\r\n\r\n    If he should wed a woman like a flower,\r\n    Fresh as the dew and royal as a rose,\r\n    Veined with spring-fire, mesmeric in repose,\r\n    His world-vext brain to lull with mystic power,\r\n    Great-souled to track his flight through heavens starred,\r\n    Upborne by wings of trust and love, yet meek\r\n    As one who has no self-set goal to seek,\r\n    His inspiration and his best reward,\r\n    At once his Art's deep secret and clear crown,\r\n    His every-day made dream, his dream fulfilled,--\r\n    If such a wife he wooed to be his own,\r\n    God knows 'twere well.

A restless heart,\r\n    As eager, ardent, hungry, as his own,\r\n    Face burned pale olive by our Southern sun,\r\n    A mind long used to musings grave apart.\r\n    Gold, noble name or fame I ne'er regret,\r\n    Albeit all are lacking; but the glow\r\n    Of spring-like beauty, but the overflow\r\n    Of simple, youthful joy. And yet--and yet--\r\n    A proud voice whispers: Vain may be his quest,\r\n    What fruit soe'er he pluck, what laurels green,\r\n    Through all the world, for just this prize unseen\r\n    I in my deep heart harbor quite unguessed:\r\n    I alone know what full hands I should bring\r\n    Were I to lay my wealth before my king.\r\n\r\n                         EMMA LAZARUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPIPISTRELLO.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am only Pipistrello. Nothing but that--nothing more than any one of\r\nthe round brown pebbles that the wind sets rolling down the dry bed of\r\nthe Tiber in summer.\r\n\r\nI am Pipistrello, the mime, the fool, the posturer, the juggler, the\r\nspangled saltinbanco, the people's plaything, that runs and leaps and\r\nturns and twists, and laughs at himself and is laughed at by all, and\r\nlives by his limbs like his brother the dancing bear and his cousin the\r\nmonkey in a red coat and a feathered cap.\r\n\r\nI am Pipistrello, five-and-twenty years old, and strong as you see, and\r\ngood to look at, the women have said. I can leap and run against any\r\nman, and I can break a bar of iron against my knee, and I can keep up\r\nwith the fastest horse that flies, and I can root up a young oak without\r\ntoo much effort. I am strong enough, and my life is at the full, and a\r\nday's sickness I never have known, and my mother is living. Yet I lie\r\nunder sentence of death, and to-morrow I die on the scaffold: if nothing\r\ncome between this and the break of dawn, I am a dead man with\r\nto-morrow's sun.\r\n\r\nAnd nothing will come: why should it?\r\n\r\nI am only Pipistrello. The people have loved me, indeed, but that is no\r\nreason why the law should spare me. Nor would I wish that it should--not\r\nI. They come and stand and stare at me through the grating, men and\r\nwomen and maidens and babies. A few of them cry a little, and one little\r\nmite of a child thrusts at me with a little brown hand the half of a red\r\npomegranate. But for the most part they laugh. Why, of course they do.\r\nThe street-children always laugh to see a big black steer with his bold\r\nhorned head go down under the mace of the butcher: the street always\r\nfinds that droll. The strength of the bull could scatter the crowd as\r\nthe north wind scatters the dust, if he were free; but he is not, and\r\nhis strength serves him nothing: the hammer fells him and the crowd\r\nlaughs.\r\n\r\nThe people of this old Orte know me so well. Right and left, up and\r\ndown, through the country I have gone all the years of my life. Wherever\r\nthere was fair or festa, there was I, Pipistrello, in the midst. It is\r\nnot a bad life, believe me. No life is bad that has the sun and the rain\r\nupon it, and the free will of the feet and the feel of the wind, and\r\nnothing between it and heaven.\r\n\r\nMy father had led the same kind of life before me: he died at Genoa, his\r\nspine broken in two, like a snapped bough, by a fall from the trapeze\r\nbefore the eyes of all the citizens. I was a big baby in that time,\r\nthrown from hand to hand by the men in their spectacles as they would\r\nhave thrown a ball or an orange.\r\n\r\nMy mother was a young and gentle creature, full of tenderness for her\r\nown people, with strangers shy and afraid. She was the daughter of a\r\npoor weaver. My father had found and wooed her in Etruria, and although\r\nhe had never taken the trouble to espouse her before the mayor, yet he\r\nhad loved her and had always treated her with great respect. She was a\r\nwoman very pure and very honest. Alas, the poor soul! To-day her hair is\r\nwhite as the snow, and they tell me she is mad. So much the better for\r\nher if she know nothing; but I fear the mad and the imbecile know all\r\nand see all, crouching in their hapless gloom.\r\n\r\nWhen my father died thus at Genoa my mother took a hatred for that\r\nmanner of living, and she broke off all ties with the athletes who had\r\nbeen his comrades, and, taking the little money that was hers in a\r\nlittle leather bag, she fled away with me to the old town of Orte, where\r\nmy grandmother still lived, the widow of the weaver. The troop wished to\r\nkeep me with them, for, although I was but five years old, I was supple\r\nand light and very fearless, and never afraid of being thrown up in the\r\nair, a living ball, in their games and sports.\r\n\r\nOrte was just the same then as it is now. These very aged towns I think\r\nnever change: if you try to alter them you must break them up and\r\ndestroy them utterly. Orte has known the Etruscans: she can very well do\r\nwithout modern folk. At Orte my mother and grandmother dwelt together in\r\none room that looked over the river--a large vaulted chamber with grated\r\ncasements, with thick stone walls--a chamber in what had once been a\r\npalace. My mother was then still very young and beautiful--of a pale,\r\nserious beauty, full of sadness. She smiled on me sometimes, but never\r\nonce did I hear her laugh. She had never laughed since that awful day\r\nwhen, in the full sunlight, in the midst of the people, in the sight of\r\nthe sea, in Genoa, a man had dropped from air to earth like an eagle\r\nfallen stone dead from the skies, struck by lightning.\r\n\r\nMy mother had many suitors. She was beautiful of face, as I say, like\r\none of the Madonnas of our old painters: she was industrious, and all\r\nher little world knew very well that she would one day inherit the strip\r\nof field and the red cow that my grandmother owned outside the gates of\r\nOrte. All these pretty suitors of course made a great fuss with me,\r\ncaressed me often, and brought me tomatoes, green figs, crickets in wire\r\ncages, fried fish and playthings. But my mother looked at none of them.\r\nWhen a woman's eyes are always looking downward on a grave, how should\r\ntheir tear-laden lids be lifted to see a fresh lover? She repulsed them\r\nall, always. She lived, lonely and sad, as well as she could in our\r\ngreat garret: we ate little, our bed was hard, and she and my grandam\r\nlabored hard to get a pittance. But when a rich bailiff sought her in\r\nhonest marriage, she kissed me and wept over me, and said again and\r\nagain, \"No, no! To your father I will be faithful, let what will chance\r\nto us.\"\r\n\r\nThe bailiff soon consoled himself: he married a big country wench who\r\nhad a fine rope of pearls and gold bracelets, and I continued to grow\r\nup by my mother's side where the Tiber is gilded with the gold of the\r\ndawns and rolls its heavy waves under the weeping boughs of its willows.\r\nMy boyish strength increased in the heat of the summers, and I grew like\r\na young brown stalk of the tall maize. I herded the cow, cut the rushes\r\nand hewed wood, and I was always happy, even when my mother would send\r\nme to the old priest to learn things out of books. She wished to make a\r\nmonk of me, but the mere idea made me shudder with fear. I loved to\r\nclimb the oaks, to swing in the maples, to scale the roofs and the\r\ntowers and the masts of the vessels. What had I to do with a monkish\r\nfrock and a whitewashed cell? _Ouf!_ I put my fingers in my ears and ran\r\naway whenever my poor mother talked of the cloister.\r\n\r\nMy limbs were always dancing, and my blood was always leaping, laughing,\r\nboiling merrily in my veins. A priest? What an idea! I had never wholly\r\nforgotten the glad, bright days of childhood when my father had thrown\r\nme about in the air like a ball: I had never wholly forgotten the shouts\r\nof the people, the sight of the human sea of faces, the loud, frank\r\nlaugh of the populace, the sparkle of the spangled habit, the\r\nintoxication of the applause of a crowd. I had only been five years old\r\nthen, yet I remembered, and sometimes in the night I cried bitterly for\r\nthose dead days. I had only been a little brown thing, with curls as\r\nblack as the raven's wing, and they had thrown me from one to the other\r\nlightly, laughingly, like a ripe apple, like a smooth peach. But I had\r\nknown what it was to get drunk on the \"hurrahs\" of the multitude, and I\r\ndid not forget them as I grew up here a youth in old Orte.\r\n\r\nThe son of an athlete can never rest quiet at home and at school like\r\nthe children of cobblers and coppersmiths and vine-dressers. All my life\r\nwas beating in me, tumbling, palpitating, bubbling, panting in\r\nme--moving incessantly, like the wings of a swallow when the hour draws\r\nnear for its flight and the thirst for the south rises in it. With all\r\nmy force I adored my pale, lovely, Madonna-like mother, but all the\r\nsame, as I trotted toward the priest with a satchel on my back, I used\r\nto think, Would it be very wicked to throw the books into the river and\r\nrun away to the fields? And, in truth, I used to run away very often,\r\nscampering over the country around Orte like a mountain-hare, climbing\r\nthe belfries of the churches, pulling off their weathercocks or setting\r\ntheir bells a-ringing--doing a thousand and one mischievous antics; but\r\nI always returned at nightfall to my mother's side. It seemed to me it\r\nwould be cruel and cowardly to leave her, for she had but me in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\"You promise to be sensible and quiet, Pippo?\" the poor soul always\r\nmurmured. And I used to say \"Yes,\" and mean it. But can a bird promise\r\nnot to fly when it feels in its instincts the coming of spring? Can a\r\nyoung colt promise not to fling out his limbs when he feels the yielding\r\nturf beneath his hoofs?\r\n\r\nI never wished to be disobedient, but, somehow, ten minutes after I was\r\nout of her sight I was high above on some tower or belfry, with the\r\nmartens and the pigeons circling about my curly head. I was so happy on\r\nhigh there, looking down on all the old town misty with dust, the men\r\nand women like ants on an antheap, the historic river like a mere\r\nribbon, yellow and twisted, the palaces and the tombs all hidden under\r\nthe same gray veil of summer dust! I was so happy there!--and they spoke\r\nof making me into a monk, or, if I would not hear of that, of turning me\r\ninto a clerk in a notary's office!\r\n\r\nA monk? a clerk? when all the trees cried out to me to climb and all the\r\nbirds called to me to fly! I used to cry about it with hot tears that\r\nstung my face like lashes, lying with my head hidden on my arms in the\r\ngrass by the old Tiber water. For I was not twelve years old, and to be\r\nshut up in Orte always, growing gray and wrinkled as the notary had done\r\nover the wicked, crabbed, evil-looking skins that set the neighbors at\r\nwar! The thought broke my heart. Nevertheless, I loved my mother, and I\r\nmended my quills, and tried to write my best, and said to the boys of\r\nthe town, \"I cannot bend iron or leap or race any more. I am going to\r\nwrite for my bread in the notary's office a year hence, for my mother\r\nwishes it, and so it must be.\"\r\n\r\nAnd I did my best not to look up to the jackdaws circling round the\r\ntowers or the old river running away to Rome. For all the waters cried\r\nto me to leap, and all the birds to fly. And you cannot tell, unless you\r\nhave been born to do it as I was, how good it is to climb and climb and\r\nclimb, and see the green earth grow pale beneath you, and the people\r\ndwindle till they are small as dust, and the houses fade till they seem\r\nlike heaps of sand. The air gets so clear around you, and the great\r\nblack wings flap close against your face; and you sit astride where the\r\nbells are, with some quaint stone face beside you that was carved on the\r\npinnacle here a thousand years and more ago, and has hardly been seen of\r\nman ever since; and the white clouds are so near you that you seem to\r\nbathe in them; and the winds toss the trees far below, and sweep by you\r\nas they go down to torment the trees and the sea, the men that work, and\r\nthe roofs that cover them, and the sails of their ships in the ocean.\r\nMen are so far from you, and heaven seems so near! The fields and the\r\nplains are lost in the vapors that divide you from them, and all their\r\nnoise of living multitudes comes very faintly to your ear, and sweetly\r\nlike the low murmuring of bees in the white blossoms of an acacia in the\r\nmonth of May.\r\n\r\nBut you do not understand, you poor toilers in cities who pace the\r\nstreet and watch the faces of the rich.\r\n\r\nI was to be a notary's clerk--I, called Pipistrello (the bat) because I\r\nwas always whirling and wheeling in air. I was to be a clerk, so my\r\nmother and grandmother decided for me, with the old notary himself who\r\nlived at the corner, and made his daily bread by carrying fire and sword\r\nwhere he could through the affairs of his neighbors. He was an old\r\nrascal, but my mother did not know that: he promised to be a safe and\r\ntrustworthy guardian of my youth, and she believed he had power to keep\r\nme safe from all dangers of destiny. She wanted to be sure that I should\r\nnever run the risks of my father's career: she wanted to see me always\r\nbefore the plate of herb soup on her table. Poor mother!\r\n\r\nOne day in Orte chance gave me another fate than this of her desires.\r\n\r\nOne fine sunrise on the morning of Palm Sunday I heard the sharp sound\r\nof a screeching fife, the metallic clash of cymbals, the shouts of boys,\r\nthe rattle of a little drum. It was the rataplan beating before a troop\r\nof wrestlers and jugglers who were traversing the Marche and Reggio\r\nEmilia. The troop stationed themselves in a little square burnt by the\r\nsun and surrounded by old crumbling houses: I ran with the rest of the\r\nlads of Orte to see them. Orte was in holiday guise: aged, wrinkled,\r\ndeserted, forgotten by the world as she is, she made herself gay that\r\nday with palms and lilies and lilac and the branches of willow; and her\r\npeople, honest, joyous, clad in their best, who filled the streets and\r\nthe churches and wine-houses, after mass flocked with one accord and\r\npressure around the play-place of the strollers.\r\n\r\nIt was in the month of April: outside the walls and on the banks of\r\nTiber, still swollen by the floods of winter, one could see the gold of\r\nmillions of daffodils and the bright crimson and yellow of tulips in the\r\ngreen corn. The scent of flowers and herbs came into the town and filled\r\nits dusky and narrow ways; the boatmen had green branches fastened to\r\ntheir masts; in the stillness of evening one heard the song of crickets,\r\nand even a mosquito would come and blow his shrill little trumpet, and\r\none was willing to say to him \"Welcome!\" because on his little horn he\r\nblew the good news, \"Summer is here!\" Ah, those bright summers of my\r\nyouth! I am old now--ay, old, though I have lived through only\r\ntwenty-five years.\r\n\r\nThis afternoon, on Palm Sunday, I ran to see the athletes as a moth\r\nflies to the candle: in Italy all the world loves the saltinbanco, be he\r\ndumb or speaking, in wood or in flesh, and all Orte hastened, as I\r\nhastened, under the sunny skies of Easter. I saw, I trembled, I laughed:\r\nI sobbed with ecstasy. It was so many years that I had not seen my\r\nbrothers! Were they not my brothers all?\r\n\r\nThis day of Palm, when our Orte, so brown and so gray, was all full of\r\nfoliage and blossom like an old pitcher full of orange-flowers for a\r\nbridal, it was a somewhat brilliant troop of gymnasts which came to\r\namuse the town. The troop was composed of an old man and his five sons,\r\nhandsome youths, and very strong, of course. They climbed on each\r\nother's shoulders, building up a living pyramid; they bent and broke\r\nbars of iron; they severed a sheep with one blow of a sword; in a word,\r\nthey did what my father had done before them. As for me, I watched them\r\nstupefied, fascinated, dazzled, drunk with delight, and almost crazy\r\nwith a torrent of memories that seemed to rain on me like lava as I\r\nwatched each exploit, as I heard each shout of the applauding\r\nmultitudes.\r\n\r\nIt is a terrible thing, a horrible thing, those inherited memories that\r\nare born in you with the blood of others. I looked at them, I say,\r\nintoxicated with joy, mad with recollection and with longing;--and my\r\nmother destined me to a notary's desk, and wished me to be shut there\r\nall my life, pen in hand, sowing the seeds of all the hatreds, of all\r\nthe crimes, of all the sorrows of mankind, lighting up the flames of\r\nrage and of greed in human souls for an acre of ground, for a roll of\r\ngold! She wished to make me a notary's clerk! I gazed at these men who\r\nseemed to me so happy--these slender, agile, vigorous creatures in their\r\nskins that shone like the skins of green snakes, in their broidered,\r\nglittering, spangled vests, in their little velvet caps with the white\r\nplume in each. \"Take me! take me!\" I shrieked to them; and the old king\r\nof the troop looked hard at me, and when their games were finished\r\ncrossed the cord that marked their arena and threw his strong arms about\r\nme, and cried, \"Body of Christ! you are little Pippo!\" For he had been\r\nmy father's mate. To be brief, when the little band left Orte I went\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\nIt was wickedly done, for my poor mother slept, knowing nothing, when in\r\nthe dusk before daybreak I slipped through the bars of the casement and\r\nnoiselessly dropped on to a raft in the river below, and thence joined\r\nmy new friends. It was wickedly done; but I could not help it. Fate was\r\nstronger than I.\r\n\r\nThe old man did not disturb himself as to whether what he had encouraged\r\nme to do was ill or well. He foresaw in me an athlete who would do him\r\nhonor and make the ducats ring merrier in his purse. Besides, I had cost\r\nhim nothing.\r\n\r\nFrom this time life indeed began for me. I wept often; I felt the barb\r\nof a real remorse; when I passed a crucifix on the road I trembled with\r\ntrue terror and penitence; but I fled away, always. I drew my girdle\r\ncloser about my spangled coat, and, despite all my remorse, I was happy.\r\nWhen I was very, very far away I wrote to my mother, and she understood,\r\npoor soul! that there were no means of forcing me back to her. Children\r\nare egotists: childhood has little feeling. When the child suffers he\r\nthirsts for his mother, but when he is happy, alas! he thinks little and\r\nrarely about her.\r\n\r\nI was very happy, full of force and of success: the men kept their word\r\nand taught me all their tricks, all their exploits. Soon I surpassed my\r\nteachers in address and in temerity. I soon became the glory of their\r\nband. In the summertime we wandered over the vast Lombard plains and the\r\nlow Tuscan mountains; in winter we displayed our prowess in Rome, in\r\nNaples, in Palermo; we loitered wherever the sun was warm or the people\r\nliked to laugh.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time I thought of my mother: I sent her money. I shivered a\r\nlittle when I saw a Madonna, for all Madonnas have the smile that our\r\nmother has for our infancy. I thought of her, but I never went home. I\r\nwas Pipistrello the champion-wrestler. I was a young Hercules, with a\r\nspangled tunic in lieu of a lion-skin. I was a thousand years, ten\r\nthousand leagues, away from the child of Orte. God is just. It is just\r\nthat I die here, for in my happy years I forgot my mother. I lived in\r\nthe sunlight--before the crowds, the nervous crowds of Italy--singing,\r\nshouting, leaping, triumphing; and I forgot my mother alone in the old\r\nchamber above the Tiber--quite alone, for my grandam was dead. That I\r\nhave slain what I have slain--that is nothing. I would do the same thing\r\nagain had I to live my life again. Yes, without pause or mercy would I\r\ndo it. But my mother--she has lived alone, and she is mad. That is my\r\ncrime.\r\n\r\nI was a tall, strong youth, full of courage and handsome to the eye of\r\nwomen: I led a life noisy and joyous, and for ever in movement. I was\r\nwhat my father had been before me. So they all said. Only I liked to\r\nfinger a book, and my father never had looked inside one, and out of\r\nremembrance of the belief of my mother I uncovered my head as I passed a\r\nchurch or saw a shrine, and to do this had not been in my father's\r\nhabits. In these years I made a great deal of money--a great deal, at\r\nleast, for a stroller--but it went as fast as it came. I was never a\r\nvicious man, nor a great gambler or drinker, yet my plump pieces soon\r\ntook wing from my pocket, for I was very gay and I liked to play a\r\nlover's part. My life was a good life, that I know: as for the life of\r\nthe rich and of the noble, I cannot tell what it is like, but I think it\r\nis of a surety more gloomy and mournful than mine. In Italy one wants so\r\nlittle. The air and the light, and a little red wine, and the warmth of\r\nthe wind, and a handful of maize or of grapes, and an old guitar, and a\r\nniche to sleep in near a fountain that murmurs and sings to the mosses\r\nand marbles,--these are enough, these are happiness in Italy. And it is\r\nnot difficult to have thus much, or was not so in those days. I was\r\nnever very poor, but whenever money jingled in my purse I treated all\r\nthe troop and half the town, and we laughed loud till daybreak.\r\n\r\nI was never aught save Pipistrello--Pipistrello the wrestler, who jumped\r\nand leaped, and lifted an ox from the ground as easily as other men lift\r\na child. No doubt to the wise it seems a fool's life, to the holy a life\r\nimpure. But I had been born for it: no other was possible to me; and\r\nwhen money rained upon me, if I could ease an aching heart, or make a\r\nsick lad the stouter for a hearty meal, or make a tiny child the gladder\r\nfor a lapful of copper coins, or give a poor stray dog a friend and a\r\nbed of straw, or a belabored mule a helpful push to the wheels of his\r\ncart,--well, that was all the good a mountebank could look to do in this\r\nworld, and one could go to sleep easy upon it.\r\n\r\nWhen the old man died who had been my father's comrade the troop fell to\r\npieces, quarrelling over his leavings. The five brothers came to a\r\ncommon issue of stabbing. In Italy one takes to the knife as naturally\r\nas a child to the breast. Tired of their disputes, I left them\r\nsquabbling and struck off by myself, and got a little band together,\r\nquite of youths, and with them made merry all across the country from\r\nsea to sea. We were at that time in the south. I was very popular with\r\nthe people. When my games were done I could sing to the mandoline, and\r\nimprovise, and make them laugh and weep: some graver men who heard me\r\nsaid I might have been a great actor or a great singer. Perhaps: I never\r\nwas anything but Pipistrello the stroller. I wanted the fresh air and\r\nthe wandering and the sports of my strength too much ever to have been\r\nshut in a roofed theatre, ever to have been cooped up where lamps were\r\nburning.\r\n\r\nOne day, when we were in dusty, brown Calabria, parching just then under\r\nJune suns, with heavy dust on its aloe-hedges and its maize-fields, a\r\nsudden remorse smote me: I thought of my mother, all alone in Orte. I\r\nhad thought of her scores of times, but I had felt ashamed to go and see\r\nher--I who had left her so basely. This day my remorse was greater than\r\nmy shame. I was master of my little troop. I said to them, \"It is hot\r\nhere: we will go up Rome-way, along the Tiber;\" and we did so.\r\n\r\nI have never been out of my own land: I fancy it must be so dark there,\r\nthe other side of the mountains. I know the by-roads and the hill-paths\r\nof Italy as a citizen knows the streets and lanes of his own _contrada_.\r\nWe worked and played our way now up through the Basilicata and Campania\r\nand Latium, till at last we were right near Orte--dull, old,\r\ngray-colored Orte, crumbling away on the banks of Tiber. Then my heart\r\nbeat and my knees shook, and I thought, If she is dead?\r\n\r\nI left my comrades drinking and resting at a wine-shop just outside the\r\ntown, and went all alone to look for her. I found the house--the gloomy\r\nbarred window hanging over the water, the dark stone walls frowning down\r\non the gloomy street. There was a woman, quite old, with white hair, who\r\nwas getting up water at the street-fountain that I had gone to a\r\nthousand times in my childhood. I looked at her. I did not know her: I\r\nonly saw a woman feeble and old. But she, with the brass _secchia_\r\nfilled, turned round and saw me, and dropped the brazen pitcher on the\r\nground, and fell at my feet with a bitter cry. Then I knew her.\r\n\r\nWhen in the light of the hot, strong sun I saw how in those ten years my\r\nmother had grown old--old, bent, broken, white-haired, in those ten\r\nyears that had been all glow and glitter, and pleasure and pastime, and\r\nmovement and mirth to me--then I knew that I had sinned against her with\r\na mighty sin--a sin of cruelty, of neglect, of selfish wickedness. She\r\nhad been young still when I had left her--young and fair to look at, and\r\nwithout a silver line in her ebon hair, and with suitors about her for\r\nher beauty like bees about the blossoms of the ivy in the autumn-time.\r\nAnd now--now she was quite old.\r\n\r\nShe never rebuked me: she only said, \"My son! my son! God be praised!\"\r\nand said that a thousand times, weeping and trembling. Some women are\r\nlike this.\r\n\r\nWhen the bright, burning midsummer day had grown into a gray,\r\nfirefly-lighted night, I laid me down on the narrow bed where I had\r\nslept as a child, and my mother kissed me as though I were a child. It\r\nseemed to purify me from all the sins of all the absent years, except,\r\nindeed, of that one unpardonable sin against her. In the morning she\r\nopened the drawers of an old bureau and showed me everything I had sent\r\nher all those years: all was untouched, the money as well as the\r\npresents. \"I took nothing while you did not give me yourself,\" she said.\r\nI felt my throat choke.\r\n\r\nIt was early day: she asked me to go to mass with her. I did so to\r\nplease her. All the while I watched her bent, feeble, aged figure and\r\nthe white hair under the yellow kerchief, and felt as if I had killed\r\nher. This lone old creature was not the mother like Raffaelle's Madonna\r\nI had left: I could never make her again what she had been.\r\n\r\n\"It is my son,\" she said to her neighbors, but she said it with pain\r\nrather than with pride, for she hated my calling; but Orte was of\r\nanother way of thinking. Orte flocked to see me, having heard of\r\nPipistrello, its own Pipistrello, who had plagued it with his childish\r\ntricks, having grown into fame amongst the cities and villages as the\r\nstrongest man in all Italy. For indeed I was that; and my mother, with\r\ndim, tear-laden eyes, looked at me and said, \"You are the image of your\r\nfather. Oh, my dear, my love! take care.\"\r\n\r\nShe, poor soul! saw nothing but the fall she had seen that day at Genoa\r\nof a strong man who dropped like a stone. But I fear to weary you. Well!\r\nI had left my spangled dress and all insignia of my calling with my\r\ncomrades at the wine-shop, fearing to harass my mother by sight of all\r\nthose things which would be so full of bitter recollection and dread to\r\nher. But Orte clamored for me to show it my powers--Orte, which was more\r\nthan half asleep by Tiber's side, like that nymph Canens whom I used to\r\nread of in my Latin school-books--Orte, which had no earthly thing to do\r\nthis long and lazy day in the drought of a rainless June.\r\n\r\nI could not afford to baulk the popular will, and I was proud to show\r\nthem all I could do--I, Pipistrello, whom they had cuffed and kicked so\r\noften in the old time for climbing their walnut trees and their pear\r\ntrees, their house-roofs and their church-towers. So, when the day\r\ncooled I drew a circle with a red rope round myself and my men on a\r\npiece of waste ground outside the town, and all Orte flocked out there\r\nas the sun went down, shouting and cheering for me as though Pipistrello\r\nwere a king or a hero. The populace is always thus--the giddiest-pated\r\nfool that ever screamed, as loud and as ignorant as a parrot, as\r\nchangeful as the wind in March, as base as the cuckoo. The same people\r\nthrew stones at me when they brought me to this prison--the same people\r\nthat feasted and applauded me then, that first day of my return to Orte.\r\nTo-day, indeed, some women weep, and the little child brings me half a\r\npomegranate. That is more remembrance than some fallen idols get, for\r\nthe populace is cruel: it is a beast that fawns and slavers, then tears.\r\n\r\nIt was a rainless June, as I say. It was very warm that evening; the low\r\nwest was vermilion and the higher sky was violet; bars of gold parted\r\nthe two colors; the crickets were hooting, the bats were wheeling, great\r\nnight-moths were abroad. I felt very happy that night. With us Italians\r\npain rarely stays long. We feel sharply, but it soon passes. I had\r\ndrowned my remorse in the glory and vanity of showing Orte all I could\r\ndo by the sheer force of my muscles and sinews. We are not a very brave\r\npeople, nor a strong one, and so strength and bravery seem very rare and\r\nfine things on our soil, and we make a great clatter and uproar when we\r\never find them amidst us. I had them both, and the people were in\r\necstasies with all I did. I put out all my powers, and in the circle of\r\nred rope exerted all my might, as though I had been performing before\r\nkings. After all, there is no applause that so flatters a man as that\r\nwhich he wrings from unwilling throats, and I know Orte had been long\r\nset against me by reason of my boyish mischief and my flight.\r\n\r\nIn real truth, I did nothing now in my manhood so really perilous as I\r\nhad done in my childhood, when I had climbed to the top of the cross on\r\nthe church and sat astride of it. But they had called that mischief and\r\nblasphemy: they called the things I did now gymnastics, and applauded\r\nthem till the noise might have wakened the Etrurian dead under the soil.\r\n\r\nAt last I came to the feat which, though far from the hardest to me,\r\nalways looked to the crowd the most wonderful: it was my old master's\r\ntrick of holding his five sons on his shoulder. Only I outshone him, and\r\nsustained on mine seven men in four tiers, and the topmost had on his\r\nhead little Febo.\r\n\r\nThe mite whom we called Phoebus, because we had found him at sunrise\r\nand he had such yellow locks--yellow as the dandelion or the\r\nbuttercup--was a stray thing picked up on the seashore in Apulia--a\r\nsoft, merry, chirping little fellow, of whom we were all fond, and to\r\nwhom we had easily taught that absence of fear which enabled us to play\r\nball with him in our spectacles. He always delighted the people, he was\r\nsuch a pretty little lad, and not, perhaps, more than four years old\r\nthen, and always laughing, always ready. To him it was only fun, as it\r\nhad been to me at his years. I never thought it was cruel to use him so,\r\nI had been so happy in it myself. All at once, as I stood erect\r\nsustaining the men on my shoulders, the topmost one holding on his head\r\nour tiny Phoebus--all at once as I did this, which I had done a\r\nhundred times, and had always done in safety--all at once, amongst the\r\nsea of upturned faces in the glowing evening light, I saw one woman's\r\neyes. She was leaning a little forward, resting her cheek on her hand.\r\nShe had black lace about her head and yellow japonica-flowers above her\r\nleft ear. She was looking at me and smiling a little.\r\n\r\nI met her eyes, full, across the dust reddened by the sunset glow as the\r\ndust of a battlefield is reddened with blood. I felt as if I were\r\nstabbed; the red dust seemed to swim round me; I staggered slightly: in\r\nanother instant I had recovered myself, but the momentary oscillation\r\nhad terrified my comrades. The seventh and highest, feeling the human\r\npyramid tremble beneath him, involuntarily, unconsciously, opened his\r\narms to save himself. He did not lose his balance, but he let the child\r\nfall. It dropped as an apple broken off the bough falls to the earth.\r\n\r\nThere was a moment of horrible silence. Then the men leaped down,\r\ntumbling and huddling one over another, not knowing what they did. The\r\naudience rose screaming; and broke the rope and swarmed into the arena.\r\nI stooped and took up the child. He was dead. His neck had been broken\r\nin the fall. He had struck the earth with the back of his head; he was\r\nrolled up on the sand like a little dead kid; his tiny tinsel crown had\r\nfallen off his curls, his tiny tinselled limbs were crushed under him,\r\nhis blossom-like mouth was half open. It was horrible.\r\n\r\nPeople spoke to me: I did not see or hear them. The crowd parted and\r\nscattered, some voluble, some dumb, with the shock of what they had\r\nseen. I lifted up what a moment before had been little Phoebus, and\r\nbore him in my arms to my mother's house.\r\n\r\nShe was sitting at home alone, as she had been alone these ten years and\r\nmore. When she saw the dead baby in those glistening spangled clothes\r\nshe shuddered, and understood without words. \"Another life?\" she said,\r\nand said nothing more: she was thinking of my father. Then she took the\r\ndead child and laid him on her knees as if he had been a living one, and\r\nrocked him on her breast and smoothed the sand out of his pretty yellow\r\ncurls. \"The people go always in the hope of seeing something die,\" she\r\nsaid at length. \"That is what they go for: you killed the baby for their\r\nsport. It was cruel.\"\r\n\r\nI went out of the house and felt as if I had murdered him--the little\r\nfair, innocent thing who had run along with us over the dusty roads, and\r\nalong the sad seashores, and under the forest trees, laughing and\r\nchirping as the birds chirp, and when he was tired lifting up his arms\r\nto be carried on the top of the big drum, and sitting there throned like\r\na king. Poor little dead Phoebus! It was true what my mother had said:\r\nthe people throng to us in hope of seeing our death, and yet when they\r\ndo see it they are frightened and sickened and sorrowful. Orte was so\r\nthis night.\r\n\r\n\"Could I help it?\" I cried to my comrades fiercely; and in my own soul I\r\nsaid to myself, \"Could I help it? That woman looked at me.\"\r\n\r\nWho was she? All through the pain that filled me for the death of the\r\nchild that wonder was awake in me always. She had looked so strange\r\nthere, so unlike the rest, though she was all in black and had the lace\r\nabout her head which is common enough in our country. All the night long\r\nI saw her face--a beautiful face, with heavy lids and drooping hair,\r\nlike that marble head they call the Braschi Antinous down in Rome.\r\n\r\nLittle Phoebus was laid that night in my mother's house, with lilies\r\nabout him, while a little candle that the moths flickered into burnt at\r\nhis feet. As I sat and watched by him to drive away the rats which came\r\nup in hordes at night from Tiber into the rooms that overhung the river,\r\nI only saw that face. It had been a bad home-coming.\r\n\r\nI would play no more in Orte, nor go with these men any more. I\r\ndisbanded my troop and let them pass their own ways. I had coin enough\r\nto live on for months: that was enough for the present. I felt as if the\r\nsight of the red rope and the spangled vest and the watching crowd would\r\nbe horrible to me--those things which I had loved so well. Little\r\nPhoebus was put away in the dark earth, as the little Etruscan\r\nchildren had been so many hundred years before him, and I buried his\r\nlittle crown and his little coat with him, as the Etruscans buried the\r\nplaythings. Poor little man! we had taught him to make Death his toy,\r\nand his toy had been stronger than he.\r\n\r\nAfter his burial I began my search for the woman whose face I had seen\r\nin the crowd. My mother never asked me whence I came or where I went.\r\nThe death of Phoebus had destroyed the trembling joy with which she\r\nhad seen me return to her: happiness came to her too late. When grief\r\nhas sat long by one hearth, it is impossible to warm the ashes of joy\r\nagain: they are cold and dead for ever. My time passed sadly; a\r\nterrible calmness had succeeded to the gayety and noise of my life; a\r\nfrightful silence had replaced the frenzied shouts, the boisterous\r\nlaughter, of the people: sometimes it seemed to me that I had died, not\r\nPhoebus.\r\n\r\nThe constant hope of finding the woman I had seen but once occupied me\r\nalways. I roamed the country without ceasing, always with that single\r\nhope before me. Days became weeks: I wandered miserably, like a dog\r\nwithout master or home.\r\n\r\nOne day I saw her. Having on my shoulder my _girella_, which gave me a\r\npretext for straying along the river-side, I came to that part of\r\nEtruria where (so I had used to learn from the school-books in my\r\nchildhood) the Etruscans in ancient times drew up in order of battle to\r\nreceive Fabius. The country is pretty about there, or at least it seemed\r\nso to me. The oak woods descend to the edge of the Tiber: from them one\r\nsees the snow of the Apennines; the little towns of Giove and Penna are\r\nwhite on the Umbrian hills; in the low fields the vine and the olive and\r\nthe maize and the wheat grow together. Here one finds our Lagherello,\r\nwhich I had heard scholars say is no other than the Lake Vadimon of\r\nwhich Pliny speaks. Of that I know nothing: it is a poor little pool\r\nnow, filled with rushes, peopled with frogs. By the side of this pool I\r\nsaw her again: she looked at me. Like a madman I plunged into the water,\r\nbut the reeds and the lilies entangled me in their meshes: the long\r\ngrasses and water-weeds were netted into an impenetrable mass. I stood\r\nthere up to my waist in water, incapable of movement, like the poor\r\ncattle of which Pliny tells, who used to mistake all this verdure for\r\ndry land, and so drifted out into the middle of the lake. She looked at\r\nme, laughed a little, and disappeared.\r\n\r\nBefore sunset I had learned who she was from a peasant who came there to\r\ncut the reeds.\r\n\r\nNear to the Lagherello is a villa named Sant' Aloïsa: about its walls\r\nthere is a sombre, melancholy wood, a remnant of that famous forest\r\nwhich in the ancient times the Romans dreaded as the borders of hell.\r\nThe Tiber rolls close by, yellow and muddy with the black buffaloes\r\ndescending to its brink to drink, and the snakes and the toads in its\r\nbrakes counting by millions--sad, always sad, whether swollen by flood\r\nin autumn and vomiting torrents of mud, or whether with naked sands and\r\nbarren bed in summer, with the fever-vapors rising from its shallow\r\nshoals. The villa is dull and mournful like the river--built of stone,\r\nfortified in bygone centuries, without color, without light, without\r\ngarden or greenery, all its casements closed like the eyelids of a\r\nliving man that is blind.\r\n\r\nThis was and is Sant' Aloïsa. In the old times, no doubt, the villa had\r\nbeen strong and great, and peopled with a brilliant feudal pomp, and\r\nnoisy with the clash and stir of soldiery: now it is poverty-stricken\r\nand empty, naked and silent, looking down on the tawny, sullen swell of\r\nthe Tiber--the terrible Tiber, that has devoured so much gold, so much\r\ntreasure, so much beauty, and hidden so many dead and so many crimes,\r\nand flows on mute and gloomy between its poisonous marshes. Of Tiber I\r\nhave always felt afraid.\r\n\r\nSant' Aloïsa has always been a fief of the old counts Marchioni. One of\r\nthat race lived still, and owned the old grounds and the old walls,\r\nthough the fortunes of the family had long fallen into decay. Taddeo\r\nMarchioni was scarcely above his own peasants in his manners and way of\r\nlife. He was ugly, avaricious, rustic, cruel. He was lord of the soil\r\nindeed, but he lived miserably, and this beautiful woman had been his\r\nwife seven years. At fifteen her father, a priest who passed as her\r\nuncle, had wedded her to Taddeo Marchioni. She had dwelt here seven\r\nmortal years, in this gloomy wood, by these yellow waters, amidst these\r\npestilential marshes. Her marriage had made her a countess, that was\r\nall. For the rest, it had consigned her, living, to a tomb.\r\n\r\nThe lives of our Italian women are gay enough in the cities, but in the\r\ncountry these women grow gray and pallid as the wings of the night-moth.\r\nThey have no love for Nature, for air, for the woods, for the fields:\r\nflowers say nothing to them. They look neither at the blossoms nor the\r\nstars. The only things which please them are a black mask and a murmur\r\nof love, a hidden meeting, the noise of the streets, the bouquets of a\r\ncarnival. What should they do in the loneliness and wildness of the\r\nbroad and open country--our women, who only breathe at their ease in the\r\nobscurity of their _palco_ or under the shelter of a domino?\r\n\r\nThe travellers who run over our land and see our women laughing with\r\nwide-opened rose-red mouths upon their balconies at Berlingaccio or at\r\nPentolaccia can never understand the immense, the inconsolable,\r\ndesolation of dulness which weighs on the lives of these women in the\r\nlittle towns of the provinces and the country-houses of the hills and\r\nplains. They have the priest and the chapel; that is all.\r\n\r\nIn Italy we have no choice between the peasant-woman toiling in the\r\nploughed fields, and growing black with the scorch of the sun, and bowed\r\nand aged with the burdens she bears, and the ladies who live between the\r\nalcove and the confessional, only going forth from their chambers by\r\nnight as fireflies glisten, and living on secret love and daily gossip.\r\nWhat can these do in their gaunt, dull villas--they who detest the sough\r\nof the wind and the sight of a tree, who flee from a dog and scream at a\r\ntempest, who will not read, and whose only lore is the sweet science of\r\nthe passions?\r\n\r\nThis I came to know later. All I saw that day, as I tramped around it\r\nwet and cold, was the gloomy evil shadow of the great place that had\r\nonce been a fortress, the barred and shattered windows, the iron-studded\r\ndoors, the grass-grown bastions. She had made me kill Phoebus, and yet\r\nI only lived to see her face again.\r\n\r\nSometimes I think love is the darkest mystery of life: mere desire will\r\nnot explain it, nor will the passions or the affections. You pass years\r\namidst crowds and know naught of it: then all at once you meet a\r\nstranger's eyes, and never again are you free. That is love. Who shall\r\nsay whence it comes? It is a bolt from the gods that descends from\r\nheaven and strikes us down into hell. We can do nothing.\r\n\r\nI went home slowly when evening fell. I had seen her eyes across the\r\ncrowd in Orte once, and once across the pool that was the Vadimon, and I\r\nwas hers for evermore. Explain that, ye wise men, who in your pride have\r\nlong words for all things. Nay, you may be wise, but it is beyond you.\r\n\r\nMy mother and I spoke but little at this time. That home was a sad one:\r\nthe death of the child and the absence of long years had left a chill in\r\nit. We ate together, chiefly in silence: it was always a pain to her\r\nthat I was but Pipistrello the gymnast--not a steadfast, deep-rooted,\r\nwell-loved citizen of Orte, with a trade to my hand and a place in\r\nchurch and market. Every day she thought I should wander again; every\r\nday she knew my savings shrank in their bag; every day she heard her\r\nneighbors say, \"And your Pippo? will he not quiet down and take a wife\r\nand a calling?\"\r\n\r\nPoor mother! Other women had their sons safe stay-at-homes, wedded\r\nfathers of children, peaceable subjects of the king, smoking at their\r\nown doors after the day's work was done. She would have been so blessed\r\nhad I been like them--I, who was a wrestler and a roysterer, a mere\r\npublic toy that had broken down in the sight of all Orte. My father had\r\nnever failed as I had failed. He had never killed a child that trusted\r\nin his strength: he had fallen himself and died. That difference between\r\nus was always in her eyes. I saw it when I met them; and she would make\r\nup little knots of common flowers and carry them to the tiny grave of\r\nPhoebus, my victim. Once I said to her, \"I could not help it: I would\r\nhave given my life to save him.\" She only replied, \"If you had consented\r\nto bide at home the child would be living.\"\r\n\r\nNay, I thought, if she had not looked at me--But of that I said nothing.\r\nI kept the memory of that woman in my heart, and went night and day\r\nabout the lake and the river and the marshes of Sant' Aloïsa. Once or\r\ntwice I saw Taddeo Marchioni, the old count--a gray, shrunken, decrepit\r\nfigure of a man, old, with a lean face and a long hard jaw--but of her,\r\nfor days that lengthened into weeks, I saw nothing. There are fish in\r\nthe Lagherello. I got the square huge net of our country, and set it in\r\nthe water as our habit is, and watched in the sedges from dawn to eve.\r\nWhat I watched for was the coming of the vision I had once seen there:\r\nthe fish came and went at their will for me.\r\n\r\nOne day, sick of watching vainly, and having some good fish in the net,\r\nI dragged them out into the reeds, and pushed them in a creel, and\r\nshouldered them, and went straight to the gloomy walls of Sant' Aloïsa.\r\nThere were no gates: the sedges of the low lands went along the front of\r\nthe great pile, almost touching it. Around it were fields gray with\r\nolives, and there was neither garden nor grass-land: all had been\r\nploughed up that was not marsh and swamp.\r\n\r\nThe great doors were close fastened. I entered boldly by a little\r\nentrance at the side, and found myself in the great naked hall of\r\nmarble, empty and still and damp. There was a woman there, old and\r\nmiserable, who called her master. Taddeo Marchioni came and saw the\r\nfish, and chaffered for them with long hesitation and shrewd greed, as\r\nmisers love to do, and then at last refused them: they were too dear, he\r\nsaid. I threw them down and said to him, \"Count, give me a stoup of wine\r\nand they are yours.\" That pleased him: he bade the serving-woman carry\r\nthe fish away, and told me to follow him. He took me into a vaulted\r\nstone chamber, and poured with a niggard hand a glass of _mezzo-vino_. I\r\nlooked at him: he was lean, gray, unlovely. I could have crushed him to\r\ndeath with one hand.\r\n\r\nThese great old villas in the lone places of Italy are usually full at\r\nleast of pleasant life--of women hurrying to the silk-worms and the\r\nspinning and the linen-press, of barefooted men loitering about on a\r\nthousand pleas or errands to their master. But Sant' Aloïsa was silent\r\nand empty.\r\n\r\nPassing an open door, I saw her. She was sitting, doing nothing, in a\r\nroom whose faded tapestries were gray as spiders' webs, and she was\r\nbeautiful as only one woman is here and there in a generation. She\r\nlooked at me, and I thought she smiled.\r\n\r\nI went out with my brain on fire and my sight dim. I saw only that\r\nsmile--that sudden, momentary smile whose fellow had brought death to\r\nlittle Phoebus. And I felt she had known me again, though she had seen\r\nme but once, in my spangled coat of velvet and silver, and now I had my\r\nlegs bare to the knee, and was clad in a rough blue shirt and woollen\r\njacket, like any other country-fellow upon Tiber's side.\r\n\r\nAs I was going out the serving-wench plucked my sleeve and whispered to\r\nme, \"Come back a moment: she wishes to see you.\"\r\n\r\nMy heart leaped, then stood still. I turned back into the house, and\r\nwith trembling knees went into that chamber where the dusky tapestry\r\nmouldered on the walls. She looked at me, sitting idly there herself in\r\nthe bare, melancholy room--a woman with the face of our Titian's Venus.\r\n\r\n\"Did the child die?\" she asked.\r\n\r\nI stammered something, I knew not what.\r\n\r\n\"Why did you tremble that day?\" she said, with the flicker of a smile\r\nabout her lovely mouth: \"you look strong--and bold.\"\r\n\r\nHow the words had courage and madness enough to leap to my lips I know\r\nnot, but I do know I said to her, \"You looked at me.\"\r\n\r\nShe frowned a moment: then she laughed. No doubt she had known it\r\nbefore. \"Your nerves were not of iron, then, as they should be,\" she\r\nsaid carelessly. \"Well! the people wanted to see something die. They\r\nalways do: you must know that. Bring more fish for my husband to-morrow.\r\nNow go.\"\r\n\r\nI trembled from head to foot. I had said this bold and insolent thing to\r\nher face, and she still bade me return!\r\n\r\nNo doubt had I been a man well born I should have fallen at her feet and\r\nsworn a midsummer madness: I should have been emboldened to any coarse\r\navowal, to any passionate effrontery. But I was only a stroller--a poor\r\nignorant soul, half Hercules, half fool. I trembled and was mute.\r\n\r\nWhen the air blew about me once more I felt as if I had been\r\ndrunk--drunk on that sweet yeasty wine of a new vintage which makes the\r\nbrain light and foolish. She had bade me return!\r\n\r\nThat day my mother ate alone at home. When night fell it found me by the\r\nLagherello. I set my nets: I slept in a shepherd's hut. I had forgotten\r\nPhoebus: I only saw her face. What was she like? I cannot tell you.\r\nShe was like Titian's Venus. Go and look at it--she who plays with the\r\nlittle dog in the Tribune at Pitti: that one I mean. With all that\r\nbeauty, half disclosed like the bud of a pomegranate-flower, she had\r\nbeen given to Taddeo Marchioni, and here for seven years she had dwelt,\r\nshut in by stone walls.\r\n\r\nLiving so, a woman becomes a saint or a devil. Taddeo Marchioni forgot\r\nor never knew that. He left her in his chamber as he left the figures of\r\nthe tapestry, till her bloom should fade like theirs, and time write\r\nwrinkles on her as it wove webs on them. He forgot! he forgot! He was\r\nold and slow of blood and feeble of sight: she was scarcely beautiful to\r\nhim. There were a few poor peasants near, and a priest as old as Taddeo\r\nMarchioni was; and though Orte was within five miles, the sour and\r\njealous temper of her husband shut her up in that prison-house as Pia\r\nTolomei was shut in the house of death in the Maremma.\r\n\r\nThat night I watched impatient for the dawn. Impatient I watched the\r\ndaybreak deepen into day. All the loveliness of that change was lost on\r\nme: I only counted the hours in restless haste. Poor fools! our hours\r\nare in sum so few, and yet we for ever wish them shorter, and fling\r\nthem, scarcely used, behind us roughly, as a child flings his broken\r\ntoys.\r\n\r\nThe sultry morning was broad and bright over the land before I dared\r\ntake up such fish as had entered my girella in the night and bend my\r\nsteps to Sant' Aloïsa. Fever-mists hung over the cane-brakes and the\r\nreedy swamps; the earth was baked and cracked; everything looked\r\nthirsty, withered, pallid, dull, decaying: in the heats of August it is\r\nalways so desolate wherever Tiber rolls. \"Marchioni is out,\" said the\r\nold brown crone whom I had seen the day before. \"But come in: bring your\r\nfish to Madama Flavia.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a strange, gaunt wilderness of stone, this old villa of the\r\nMarchioni. It would have held hundreds of serving-men--it had as many\r\nchambers as one of the palaces down in Rome--but this old woman was all\r\nthe servitor it had, and in the grand old hall, with sculptured shields\r\nupon the columns of it and Umbrian frescoes in the roof, she spread\r\ntheir board and brought them their onion-soup and their dish of _pasta_,\r\nand while they ate it looked on and muttered her talk and twirled her\r\ndistaff, day after day, year after year, the same. Life is homely and\r\nfrugal here, and has few graces. The ways of life in these grand old\r\nplaces are like nettles and thistles set in an old majolica vase that\r\nhas had knights and angels painted on it. You know what I mean, you who\r\nknow Italy. Do you remember those pictures of Vittorio Carpaccio and of\r\nGentiléo? They say that this is the life our Italy saw once in her\r\ncities and her villas: that is the life she wants. Sometimes, when you\r\nare all alone in these vast deserted places, the ghosts of all that\r\npageantry pass by you, and they seem fitter than the living people for\r\nthese courts and halls.\r\n\r\n\"Madama Flavia will see the fish,\" said the old crone, and hobbled away.\r\n\r\nMadama Flavia! How many times has Tiber heard such a name as that\r\nbreathed on a lover's mouth to the sigh of the mandoline, uttered in\r\nrevel or in combat, or as a poisoner whispered it stealing to mix the\r\ndrug with the wine in the goblet. Madama Flavia! All Italy seemed in\r\nit--all love, all woe! There is a magic in some names.\r\n\r\nMadama Flavia! Just such a woman as this it needs would be to fitly wear\r\nsuch a name--a woman with low brows and eyes that burn, and a mouth like\r\nthe folded leaves that lie in the heart of a rose--a woman to kneel at\r\nmorn in the black shadows of the confessional, and to go down into the\r\ncrowd of masks at night and make men drunk with love.\r\n\r\n\"Madama Flavia!\" The name (so much it said to me) halted stupidly on my\r\nlips: I stood in her presence like a foolish creature. I never before\r\nhad lacked either courage or audacity: I trembled now. I had been awake\r\nall the night, gazing at the dim, dusky pile of her roof as it rose out\r\nfrom the olives black against the stars; and she knew it--she knew it\r\nvery well. That I saw in her face. And she was Madama Flavia, and I was\r\nPipistrello the juggler. What could I say to her? I could have fallen at\r\nher feet and kissed her or killed her, but I could not speak. No doubt I\r\nlooked but a poor boor to her--a giant and a dolt.\r\n\r\nShe was leaning against a great old marble vase--leaning her hands on\r\nit, and her chin on her hands. She had some red carnations in her\r\nbreast: their perfume came to me. She was surrounded by decay, dusty\r\ndesolation, the barrenness of a poverty that is drearier than any of the\r\npoverty of the poor; but so might have looked Madama Lucrezia in those\r\nold days when the Borgia was God's vicegerent.\r\n\r\nAt the haul of fish she never glanced: she gazed at me with meditation\r\nin her eyes. \"You are very strong,\" she said abruptly.\r\n\r\nAt that I could do no less than laugh. It was as if she had said the ox\r\nin the yoke was strong or the Tiber strong at flood.\r\n\r\n\"Why are you a fisherman now?\" she said. \"Why do you leave your arena?\"\r\n\r\nI shuddered a little. \"Since the child fell\"--I muttered, thinking she\r\nwould understand the remorse that made my old beloved calling horrible\r\nto me.\r\n\r\n\"It was no fault of yours,\" she said with a dreamy smile. \"They say I\r\nhave the evil eye--\"\r\n\r\n\"You have, madama,\" I said bluntly, and then felt a choking in my\r\nthroat, fearing my own rashness.\r\n\r\nHer beautiful eyes had a bright scorn in them, and a cold mockery of me.\r\n\"Why do you stay, then?\" she asked, and smiled at the red carnations\r\ncarelessly.\r\n\r\n\"Because--rather would I die of beholding you than live shut out from\r\nsight of you,\" I said in my madness. \"Madama, I am a great useless fool:\r\nI have done nothing but leap and climb and make a show. I am big and\r\nstrong as the oxen are, but they work, and I have never worked. I have\r\nshown myself, and the people have thrown me money--a silly life, good to\r\nno man or beast. Oh yes, that I know full well now; and I have killed\r\nPhoebus because you looked at me; and my mother, who has loved me all\r\nher life, is old before her time through my fault. I am a graceless\r\nfool, a mountebank. When I put off my spangles and stand thus, you see\r\nthe rude peasant that I am. And yet in all the great, wide, crowded\r\nworld I know there does not live another who could love you as I\r\nlove--seeing you twice.\"\r\n\r\nI stopped; the sound of my own voice frightened me; the dull tapestries\r\nupon the wall heaved and rocked round me. I saw her as through a mist,\r\nleaning there with both arms on the broken marble vase.\r\n\r\nA momentary smile passed over her face. She seemed diverted, not angered\r\nas I feared. She had listened without protest. No doubt she knew it very\r\nwell before I spoke. \"You are very strong,\" she said at length. \"Strong\r\nmen are always feeble--somewhere. If the count Taddeo heard you he\r\nwould--\" Then some sudden fancy struck her, and she laughed aloud, her\r\nbright red lips all tremulous and convulsed with laughter. \"What could\r\nhe do? You could crush him with one hand, as you could crush a newt!\r\nPoor Taddeo! did he not beat your fish down, give you watered wine, the\r\nrinsings of the barrel, yesterday? That is Taddeo always.\"\r\n\r\nShe laughed again, but there was something so cruel in that laughter\r\nthat it held me mute. I dared not speak to her. I stood there stupidly.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know that he is rich?\" she said abruptly, gnawing with her\r\nlovely teeth the jagged leaf of one of her carnations. \"Yes, he is rich,\r\nTaddeo. That is why my father sold me to him. Taddeo is rich: he has\r\ngold in the ground, in the trees, in the rafters and the stones of the\r\nhouse; he has gold in Roman banks; he has gold in foreign scrip, and in\r\nships, and in jewels, and in leases: he is rich. And he lives like a\r\ngray spider in the cellar-corner. He shuts me up here. We eat black\r\nbread, we see no living soul: once in the year or so I go to Orte or to\r\nPenna. And I am twenty-three years old, and I can read my own face in\r\nthe mirror.\" She paused; her breast heaved, her beautiful low brows drew\r\ntogether in bitter fury at her fate: she had no thought of me.\r\n\r\nI waited, mute. I did not dare to speak.\r\n\r\nIt was all true: she was the wife of Taddeo Marchioni, shut here as in a\r\nprison, with her youth passing and her loveliness unseen, and her angry\r\nsoul consuming itself in its own fires. I loved her: what use was that\r\nto her--a man who had naught in all the world but the strength of his\r\nsinews and muscles?\r\n\r\nShe remembered me suddenly, and gave me a gesture of dismissal: \"Take\r\nyour fish to the woman; I cannot pay you for them; I have never as much\r\nas a bronze coin. But--you may come back another day. Bring more--bring\r\nmore.\" Then with a more imperious gesture she made me leave her.\r\n\r\nI stumbled out of the old dark, close-shuttered house into the burning\r\nbrilliancy of the August day, giddy with passion and with hope. She knew\r\nI loved her, and yet she bade me return!\r\n\r\nI know not how much, how little, that may mean in other lands, but here\r\nin Italy it has but one language--language enough to make a lover's\r\nheart leap like the wild goat. Yet hope is perhaps too great a word to\r\nmeasure rightly the timid joy that filled my breast. I lay in the\r\nshepherd's hut wide awake that night, hearing the frogs croak from the\r\nLagherello and the crickets sing in the hot darkness. The hut was empty:\r\nshepherd and sheep and dogs were all gone up to the higher grounds\r\namongst the hills. There were some dry fern-plants in a corner of it. I\r\nlay on these and stared at the planets above me throbbing in the\r\nintense blue of the skies: they seemed to throb, they seemed alive.\r\n\r\nA mile away, between me and the stars, was the grand black pile of Sant'\r\nAloïsa.\r\n\r\nChrist! it was strange! I had led a rough life, I had been no saint. I\r\nhad always been ready for jest or dance or intrigue with a pretty woman,\r\nand sometimes women far above me had cast their eyes down on the arena,\r\nas in Spain ladies do in the bull-ring to pick a lover out thence for\r\nhis strength; but I had never cared. I had loved, laughed and wandered\r\naway with the stroller's happy liberty, but I had never cared. Now, all\r\nat once, the whole world seemed dead--dead heaven and earth--and only\r\none woman's two eyes left living in the universe, living and looking\r\ninto my soul and burning it to ashes. Do you know what I mean? No? Ah,\r\nthen you know not love.\r\n\r\nAll the night I lay awake--the short hot night when the western gold of\r\nsunset scarce fades into dark ere the east seems to glow luminous and\r\ntransparent with the dawn. Ah! the sunrise! I shall see it once more,\r\nonly once more! I shall see it through those bars, a hand's breadth of\r\nit above Tiber, no more; and when again it spreads its rosy warmth over\r\nthe sky and reddens the river and the plain, I shall be dead--a headless\r\nthing pushed away under the earth and lime, and over my brain and skull\r\nthe wise men will peer with knife and scalpel, and pour the plaster over\r\nits bones to take a cast, and say most likely to one another, as I heard\r\nthem say once before a cast in a museum, \"A good face, a fair brow, fine\r\nlines: strange that he should have been a murderer!\" Well! so be it.\r\nEven though I lived for fourscore years and ten, the sun would nevermore\r\nrise for me as it rose before Phoebus died.\r\n\r\nAt that time I lived only to see a shadow on the barred windows, a hand\r\nopen a lattice, a veiled head glide by through the moonbeams. I was\r\nwretched, yet never had I been so happy. The bolt of the gods stuns as\r\nit falls, but it intoxicates also.\r\n\r\nI had been such a fool! such a fool! When she had said so much I had\r\nsaid nothing: that last moment haunted me with unending pain. If I had\r\nbeen bolder, if I had only known what to answer, if I had only seized\r\nher in my arms and kissed her! It would have been better to have had\r\nthat one moment, and have died for it, than have been turned out of her\r\npresence like a poor cowardly clod.\r\n\r\nI cannot tell how the long hot days went on: they were days of drought\r\nto the land, but they were days of paradise to me. The fever-mists were\r\nheavy and the peasants sickened. Tiber was low, and had fetid odors as\r\nits yellow shallows dried up in the sun, clouds of gnats hovered over\r\nthe Lagherello and its beds of rushes, and the sullen wind blew always\r\nfrom the south-east, bringing the desert sand with it. But to me this\r\nsickly summer was so fair that I continued to live in the absent\r\nshepherd's empty hut. I continued to net the fish when I could, and now\r\nand again I saw her. I lived only in the hope of seeing her face. She\r\nhad the evil eye. Well, let it rest on me and bring me all woe, so that\r\nonly I might live in its light one day! So I said in my madness, not\r\nknowing.\r\n\r\nI must have looked mad at that time to the few scattered peasants about\r\nthe pool. I lived on a handful of maize, a crust of bread. I cast my\r\nnets in the water, and once or twice went up to Sant' Aloïsa with the\r\nsmall fish, and was sent away by the crone Marietta. August passed, and\r\nthe time drew nigh for the gathering of the grapes, ripe here sooner\r\nthan in the Lombard and the Tuscan plains. But the vintage of Sant'\r\nAloïsa was slight, for the ground was covered with olives in nearly\r\nevery part. When they were stripping what few poor vines there were I\r\noffered myself for that work. I thought so I might behold her. There was\r\nno mirth on the lands of Taddeo Marchioni: the people were poor and\r\ndull. Fever that came from the river and the swamps had lessened their\r\nnumbers by death and weakened those who were living: my strength was\r\nwelcome to those ague-stricken creatures.\r\n\r\nThe day of the gathering was very hot: no rain had fallen. The oxen in\r\nthe wains were merely skin and bone: their tongues were parched and\r\nswollen in their muzzled mouths. The grass had been long all burnt up,\r\nand the beasts famished: the air was stifling, pregnant with storm.\r\n\r\nAmidst the sere and arid fields, and the woods, black and gray, of ilex\r\nand of olive, the great old square house rose before us, pale, solitary,\r\nmysterious--a mausoleum that shut in living creatures: it terrified me.\r\n\r\nNight fell as the last wagon, loaded with the last casks of grapes,\r\nrolled slowly with heavy grinding wheels toward the cellars of Sant'\r\nAloïsa. With the wagon there were a few men enfeebled with fever, a few\r\nwomen shivering with ague. I walked behind the wagon, pushing it to aid\r\nthe weary oxen. There was no moon: here and there a torch flickered in a\r\ncopper sconce filled with oil. The courtyard and the cellar were of\r\nenormous size: in the old times Sant' Aloïsa had sheltered fifteen\r\nhundred men. In the darkness, where a torch flared when he passed, I saw\r\nnow and then Taddeo Marchioni coming and going, giving orders in his\r\nhigh, thin voice, screaming always, swearing sometimes, always\r\nsuspecting some theft. He did not see me. He was entirely absorbed in\r\nhis vintage and in the rebukes he hurled at his peasants. I drew back\r\ninto the shadow, leaning against the column of the gateway, a huge wall\r\nblackened with time and damp. The bell of the old clock-tower sounded\r\nthe nineteenth hour of the night. All at once the servant Marietta\r\nmuttered in my ear, \"Go in: she wants to speak with you. Go in to the\r\ntapestry-room on the other side of the house: you remember.\"\r\n\r\nMy blood bounded in my veins. I asked nothing better of Fate. I glided\r\nalong the old walls, leaving the central court and the master there\r\nabsorbed in his work, and I found with some difficulty the little\r\nside-door by which I had entered the house before. I trembled from head\r\nto foot, as in that hour. I felt myself all at once to be ugly, heavy,\r\nstupid, a brute to frighten any woman--sweating from the labors of the\r\nday, covered with dust, poor and frightful in my rough hempen shirt,\r\nwith my naked legs and my bare knees impregnated with the juice of the\r\ngrapes. And I dared to love this woman--I! Loved her, though she had\r\nslain Phoebus.\r\n\r\nMy mind was all in confusion: I was no longer master of myself. I\r\nscarcely drew breath; my head was giddy; I staggered as I went along\r\nthose endless galleries and passages, as I had done that day when\r\nPhoebus had fallen on the sand of my arena. At last I reached--how I\r\nknew not--the room of the _arazzi_, scarcely lighted by a lamp of bronze\r\nthat hung from the ceiling by a chain. In the twilight I saw the woman\r\nwith the fatal gaze, with the lips of rose, with the features of\r\nLucrezia, of Venus, the woman who in all ages has destroyed man.\r\n\r\nThen I forgot that I was a laborer, a peasant, a juggler, a wrestler, a\r\nvagabond--that I was clad in coarse linen of hemp--that I was dirty and\r\nfilthy and ignorant and coarse. I forgot myself: I only remembered my\r\nlove--my love immense as the sky, omnipotent as Deity. I fell on my\r\nknees before her. I only cried with stifled voice, \"I am yours! I am\r\nyours!\" I did not even ask her to be mine. I was her slave, her tool,\r\nher servitor, her thing, to be cherished or rejected as she would. I\r\nshivered, I sobbed. I had never known before, it seemed to me, what love\r\ncould be; and it made a madman of me.\r\n\r\nAll the while she said nothing: she let me kiss her gown, her feet, the\r\nstone floor on which she stood. Suddenly and abruptly she said only,\r\n\"You are a droll creature: you love me, really--you?\"\r\n\r\nThen I spoke, beside myself the while. I remember nothing that I said:\r\nshe heard me in silence, standing erect above me where I kneeled. The\r\nlight was very faint; the lamp swung to and fro on its bronze chain; I\r\nsaw only the eyes of the woman burning their will into mine. She bent\r\nher head slightly: her voice was very low. She said only, \"I have known\r\nit a long time. Yes, you love me, but how? How?\"\r\n\r\nHow? I knew no words that could tell her. Human tongues never have\r\nlanguage enough for that: a look can tell it. I looked at her.\r\n\r\nShe trembled for a moment as though I had hurt her. Soon she regained\r\nher empire over herself. \"But how?\" she muttered very low, bending over\r\nme her beautiful head, nearly touching mine. \"But how? Enough to--?\"\r\n\r\nShe paused. Enough? Enough for what? Enough to deny heaven, to defy\r\nhell, to brave death and torment, to do all that a man could do: who\r\ncould do more?\r\n\r\n\"And I love you--I.\" She murmured the words very low: the evening wind\r\nwhich touches the roses was never softer than her voice. She brushed my\r\nhair with her lips. \"I love you,\" she repeated. \"For you are strong, you\r\nare strong.\"\r\n\r\nKneeling before her there, I took her in my arms. I drew her close to\r\nme: I drank the wine of Paradise--the wine that makes men mad.\r\n\r\nBut she stopped me, drew herself away from me, yet gently, without\r\nwrath. \"No,\" she said, \"not yet, not yet.\" Then she added, lower still,\r\n\"You must deserve me.\"\r\n\r\nDeserve her? I did not comprehend. I knew well that I did not deserve my\r\njoy, poor fool that I was, mere man of the people, with the trestles of\r\nthe village fair for all my royal throne. But, since she loved me, a\r\ncrowd of ideas confused and giddy thronged on my brain and whirled madly\r\ntogether. Up above in the belfries and the towers in my infancy, with\r\nthe clear blue air about me and the peopled world at my feet, I had\r\ndreamed so many foolish gracious things--things heroical, fantastical,\r\nwoven from the legends of saints and the poems of wandering minstrels.\r\nWhen she spoke to me thus these old beautiful fancies came back to my\r\nmemory. If she wished me to become a soldier for her sake, I thought--\r\n\r\nShe looked at me, burning my soul with her eyes, that grew sombre yet\r\nbrilliant, like the Tiber water lighted by a golden moon. \"You must\r\ndeserve me,\" she repeated: \"you must deliver me. You are strong.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am ready,\" I answered. I was still kneeling before her. I had at my\r\nthroat a rude cross that my mother had hung there in my childish years.\r\nI touched the cross with my right hand in sign of oath and\r\nsteadfastness. \"I am ready,\" I said to her. \"What do you wish?\"\r\n\r\nShe answered, \"You must free me. You are strong.\"\r\n\r\nEven then I did not understand. \"Free?\" I repeated. \"You would fly with\r\nme?\"\r\n\r\nShe gave a gesture, superb, impatient, contemptuous. She drew herself\r\nbackward and more erect. Her eyes had a terrible brilliancy in them. She\r\nwas so beautiful, but as fierce in that hour as the wild beast that I\r\nsaw once at a fair break from its cage and descend amidst the people,\r\nand which I strangled in my arms unaided.\r\n\r\nShe murmured through her closed teeth, \"You must kill him. You are\r\nstrong.\"\r\n\r\nWith a bound I rose to my feet. In the burning night an icy cold chilled\r\nmy blood, my limbs, my heart.\r\n\r\nKill him? Whom? The old man? I, young and strong as I was, and his\r\nwife's lover?\r\n\r\nI looked at her. What will be the scaffold to-morrow to me, since I have\r\nlived through that moment?\r\n\r\nShe looked at me, always with her sorceress's eyes. \"You must kill him,\"\r\nshe said briefly. \"It will be so easy to you. If you love me it will be\r\ndone. If not--farewell.\"\r\n\r\nA horrible terror seized on me. I said nothing. I was stupefied. The\r\ngloomy shadows of the chamber surrounded us like a mystic vapor; the\r\npale figures of the tapestries seemed like the ghosts arisen from the\r\ngrave to witness against us; the oppressive heat of the night hour lay\r\non our heads like an iron hand.\r\n\r\nA phantom parted us: the spectre of a cowardly crime had come between\r\nus.\r\n\r\n\"You do not love me,\" she said slowly. She grew impatient, angered,\r\nfeverish: a dumb rage began to work in her. She had no fear.\r\n\r\nI drew my breath with effort. It seemed as if some one were strangling\r\nme. Kill him! Kill him! These ghastly words re-echoed in my ears. Kill\r\nan old and feeble man? It was worse than a crime: it was a cowardice.\r\n\r\n\"You do not love me,\" she repeated with utter scorn. \"Go--go!\"\r\n\r\nA cry to her sprang from my very soul: \"Anything else, anything but\r\nthat! Ask my own life, and you shall have it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I ask what I wish.\"\r\n\r\nAs she answered me thus she drew herself in all her full height upward\r\nunder the faint radiance from the lamp. Her magnificent beauty shone in\r\nit like a grand white flower of the datura under the suns of autumn. A\r\ndisdain without bounds, without limit, without mercy, gleamed from her\r\neyes. She despised me--a man of the people, a public wrestler, a bravo,\r\nonly made to kill at his mistress's order, only of use to draw the\r\nstiletto in secrecy at the whim and will of a woman.\r\n\r\nI was Italian, yet I dared not slay a feeble old man in the soft dark of\r\na summer night, to find my reward on the breast of his wife.\r\n\r\nSilence fell between us. Her eyes of scorn glanced over me, and all her\r\nbeauty tempted me and cried to me, \"Kill, kill, kill! and all this is\r\nthine!\"\r\n\r\nThen her eyes filled with tears, her proud loveliness grew humble, and,\r\na supplicant, she stretched out her arms to me: she cried, \"Ah, you love\r\nme not: you have no pity. I may live and die here: you will not save me.\r\nYou are strong as the lions are--you are so strong, and yet you are\r\nafraid.\"\r\n\r\nI shook in all my limbs. Yes, I was afraid--I was afraid of her, afraid\r\nof myself. I shivered: she looked at me always, her burning eyes now\r\nhumid and soft with tears.\r\n\r\n\"In open war, in combat, all you wish,\" I said to her slowly. \"But an\r\nold man--in secret--to be his assassin--\"\r\n\r\nMy voice failed me. I saw the light in the lamp that swung above,\r\noscillating between us: it seemed to me like the frail life of Taddeo\r\nMarchioni that swung on a thread at our will.\r\n\r\nShe drew herself upward once more. Her tears were burned up in the fires\r\nof a terrible dumb rage. She cried aloud, \"You are a coward. Go!\"\r\n\r\nI fell once more at her feet; I seized her by her gown; I kissed her\r\nfeet. \"Any other thing!\" I cried to her in my anguish--\"any other thing!\r\nBut the life of a weak old man! It would be horrible. I am not a coward:\r\nI am brave. It is for cowards to kill the feeble: I cannot. And you\r\nwould not wish it? No, no, you would not wish it? It is a dream, a\r\nnightmare! It is not possible. I adore you! I adore you! I am a madman.\r\nI am yours; I give you my life; I give you my body and my soul. But to\r\nkill a feeble old man that I could crush in my arms as a fly is stifled\r\nin wine! No, no, no! Any other thing, any other thing! But not that.\"\r\n\r\nShe thrust me from her with her foot. \"That or nothing,\" she said\r\ncoldly.\r\n\r\nThe sweat fell from my brow in the agony of this horrible hour. I was\r\nready to give my life for her, but an old man, a murder done in secret!\r\nAll my soul revolted.\r\n\r\n\"But you love me!\" I cried to her; and a great sob rose in my throat.\r\n\r\n\"You refuse to do this thing?\" she answered.\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nThen she threw me away from her with the strength of a tigress:\r\n\"Imbecile! You thought I loved you? I should have used you: that is\r\nall.\"\r\n\r\nThe lamp went out: the darkness was complete. I stretched my hands out,\r\nto meet but empty air. If I were alone I could not tell: I touched\r\nnothing, I heard nothing, I saw nothing. A strange giddiness came upon\r\nme; my limbs trembled under the weight of my body and gave way; I lost\r\nconsciousness. It is what we call in this country a stroke of the blood.\r\n\r\nWhen my senses revived I opened my eyes. It was still night about me,\r\nbut a pallid light shone into the chamber, for the moon had risen, and\r\nits rays penetrated through the iron bars of the high windows. I\r\nremembered all.\r\n\r\nI rose with pain and effort: the heavy fall on the stone floor had\r\nbruised and strained me. A great stupor, the stupor of horror, had\r\nfallen upon me. I felt all at once old, quite old. The thought of my\r\nmother passed through my mind for the first time for many days. My poor\r\nmother!\r\n\r\nBy the light of the moon I tried to find my way out of this chamber--a\r\nchamber accursed. I gained the entrance of the gallery. Silence reigned\r\neverywhere. I could not tell what hour it was. The lustre from the skies\r\nsufficed to illumine fitfully the vast and sombre passages. I found the\r\ndoor by which I had entered the house, and I felt the hot air of the\r\nnight blow upon my forehead, as hot now as it had been at noonday.\r\n\r\nI passed into the great open court. Above it hung the moon, late risen,\r\nround, yellow, luminous. I looked upward at it: this familiar object\r\nseemed to me a strange and unknown thing. I walked slowly across the\r\npavement of the courtyard on a sheer instinct, as you may see a wounded\r\ndog walk, bearing death in him. My heart seemed like a stone in my\r\nbreast: my blood seemed like ice in my veins. All around me were the\r\nwalls of Sant' Aloïsa, silent, gray, austere.\r\n\r\nMy foot touched something on the ground. I looked at it. It was a thing\r\nwithout form--a block of oak wood or a slab of marble?--yet I looked at\r\nit, and my eyes were rooted there and could not look elsewhere. The moon\r\nshed a sinister white light upon this thing. I looked long, standing\r\nthere motionless and without power to move. Then I saw what it was, this\r\nshapeless thing: it was the body of Taddeo Marchioni--dead, horribly\r\ndead, fallen face downward, stretched out upon the stones, a knife\r\nplunged into the back of the throat, and left there. He had been stabbed\r\nfrom behind.\r\n\r\nI looked, I saw, I understood: it was her act.\r\n\r\nI stooped; I touched the corpse; I turned the face to the light; I\r\nsearched for a pulse of life, a breath. There was none: he was dead. A\r\nsingle blow had been given, and the blow had been sure. A ghastly\r\ngrimace distended the thin lips of the toothless mouth; the eyes were\r\nstarting from their orbits; the hands were clenched: it had been a death\r\nswift, silent, violent, terrible.\r\n\r\nI drew out the knife, deep buried in the bone of the throat below the\r\nskull. It was my knife, the same with which I had slashed asunder the\r\nboughs of the vines in the day just gone in the vintage-fields. She had\r\ntaken it, no doubt, from my girdle when I had fallen at her feet.\r\n\r\n\"I understand,\" I said to the dead man: \"it is her work.\"\r\n\r\nThe dead mouth seemed to laugh.\r\n\r\nA casement opened on the court. A voice cried aloud. The voice was hers:\r\nit cried for help. From the silent dwelling came a sound of hurrying\r\nfeet: the flame of a torch borne in a peasant's hand fell red on the\r\nlivid moonlight.\r\n\r\nShe came with naked feet, with unloosed hair, as though roused from her\r\nbed, beautiful in her disarray, and crying aloud, \"An assassin! an\r\nassassin!\"\r\n\r\nI understood all. She meant to send me to the scaffold in her place. It\r\nwas my knife: that would be testimony enough for a tribunal. Justice is\r\nblind.\r\n\r\nShe cried aloud: they seized me, and the dead man lay between us,\r\nstretched on the stones and bathed in blood. I looked at her: she did\r\nnot tremble.\r\n\r\nBut she had forgotten that I was strong--strong with the strength of the\r\nlion, of the bull, of the eagle. She had forgotten. With a gesture I\r\nflung far away from me, against the walls, the men who had seized me:\r\nwith a bound I sprang upon her. I took her in my arms in her naked\r\nloveliness, scarcely veiled by the disordered linen, by the loosened\r\nhair, and shining like marble in the glisten of the moon. I seized her\r\nin my arms; I kissed her on her lips; I pressed against my heart her\r\nbeautiful white bosom. Then between her two breasts I plunged my knife,\r\nred with the blood of her dead lord. \"I avenge Phoebus,\" I said to\r\nher.\r\n\r\nNow you know why to-morrow they will kill me, why my mother is mad.\r\n\r\nHush! I am tired. Let me sleep in peace.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd on the morrow he slept.\r\n\r\nOUIDA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTUDIES IN THE SLUMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--NAN; OR, A GIRL'S LIFE.\r\n\r\n\"An' this one? Lord have mercy on her, an' forgive me for saying it the\r\nway I do every time I look at her! It comes out of itself, an' there's\r\ntimes when I could think for a minute that He will; an' then it comes\r\nover me like a blackness on everything that her chance is gone. Look at\r\nthat one by her. Ain't he a rough? Ain't he just fit for the Rogues'\r\nGallery, an' nowhere else? And yet--Well, it's a long story, an' you\r\nwon't want to hear it all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Every word,\" I said. \"For once, we are all alone, and the rain pours\r\ndown so nobody is likely to interrupt. Such a face as that could hardly\r\nhelp having a story, and a strange one.\"\r\n\r\n\"The most of it happens often enough, but I'll tell you. You think it's\r\npretty, but that black an' white thing doesn't tell much. If you could\r\nonce have looked at her, you'd have wanted to do something, same as\r\n'most everybody did when the time for doin' was over. Let me get my bit\r\nof work, an' then I'll tell you.\"\r\n\r\nIt was in the \"McAuley Mission-parlor.\" The street below, cleared by the\r\npouring rain, was comparatively silent, though now and then a sailor\r\nswung by unmindful of wet, or the sound of a banjo came from the\r\ntenement-houses opposite. Below us, in the chapel, the janitor scrubbed\r\nvigorously to the tune which seems for some unknown reason to be always\r\na powerful motive-power,\r\n\r\n    \"I'm goin' home, no more to roam,\"\r\n\r\nthe brush coming down with a whack at each measure. In my hands was the\r\nmission album, a motley collection of faces, as devoid of Nature or any\r\nclew to the real characteristics of the owners as the average photograph\r\nusually is, but here and there one with a suggestion of interest and, in\r\nthis special case, of beauty--a delicate, pensive face, with a mass of\r\nfloating hair, deep, dark eyes, and exquisite curves in cheek and lip\r\nand chin--the face of some gently born and nurtured maiden, looking\r\ndreamily out upon a world which thus far, at least, could have shown her\r\nonly its tender, never its cruel or unfriendly, side, and not, as its\r\nplace would indicate, that of one who had somehow and at some strange\r\ntime found a home in these slums. Beauty of a vulgar, striking sort is\r\ncommon enough there--vivid coloring, even a sparkle and light poverty\r\nhas had no power to kill--but this face had no share in such dower, and\r\nthe dark, soft eyes had a compelling power which made mine search them\r\nfor their secret,--not theirs, after all, it might prove, but only a\r\ngift from some remote ancestor, who could transmit outline, and even\r\nexpression, but not the soul that had made them.\r\n\r\nMrs. McAuley slipped the picture from its place as she sat down by me\r\nagain. \"I ought to have done that long ago,\" she said. \"Jerry is always\r\ntelling me I've no business to keep it where everybody can look at it\r\nan' ask about her; an' I hadn't, indeed, for it brings up a time I'd\r\nhardly think or talk about unless I had to for some good. I'll put it\r\naway with two or three more I keep for myself; an' Jerry'll be glad of\r\nit, for he hates to think of her, 'most as much as I do.\r\n\r\n\"Her father and mother? Ah, that's it: if she'd had _them_! But, you\r\nsee, her mother was a young thing that wasn't used to roughing it, an'\r\nthis Nan only a baby then. They were decent English folks, an' he looked\r\nlike a gentleman; but all we know was that she died of ship-fever on the\r\npassage over, an' was buried at sea; an' he had it too, an' came 'most\r\nas nigh dyin', an' just had strength to crawl ashore with Nan in his\r\narms. He'd a cousin in the Bowery, a woman that kept a little store for\r\nnotions, but didn't make any headway on account of two drinkin' sons;\r\nan' he went to her, an' just fell on the floor before he'd half finished\r\nhis story. She put him to bed, and, though the sons swore he shouldn't\r\nstay, an' said they'd chuck him out on the sidewalk, she had her way. It\r\ndidn't take him long to die, an' he'd a good bit of money that\r\nreconciled them; but when he was gone there was the baby, just walkin'\r\nan' toddlin' into everything, an' would scream if Pete came near her. He\r\nwas the oldest, an' he hated her worse than poison, an' about once in so\r\noften he'd swear he'd send her to the orphan asylum or anywhere that\r\nshe'd be out of his sight. Jack didn't care one way or another, but the\r\nmother was just bound up in the little thing; an' she was, they said,\r\njust that wonderful-lookin' that people stopped an' stared at her. Her\r\neyes weren't black, as they look there, but gray, with those long curly\r\nlashes that looked innocent an' baby-like to the very last minute; and\r\nher hair--oh, you never saw such hair! Not bleached out, as they do it\r\nnow, to a dead yellow, but a pure gold-color, an' every thread of it\r\nalive. I've taken hold of it many a time to see it curl round my finger,\r\nan' the little rings of it lying round her forehead; an' her face to the\r\nlast as pure-lookin' as a pearl--clear an' soft, you know--an', when I\r\nsaw her first, with a little color in her cheeks no deeper than the pink\r\nin a pink rose.\r\n\r\n\"Now, it'll seem to you like a bit out of the _Police Gazette_ or those\r\nhorrid story-papers, but, do you know, when she wasn't three Pete came\r\nhome one night just drunk enough to be cunnin', an' he said, after he'd\r\nhad his supper, he wanted to take the child a little way, only round the\r\ncorner, to show her to some friends of his. Mrs. Simpson said\r\nNo--whoever wanted to see her could come there, but she shouldn't let\r\nher be taken round. The shop-bell rang that minute, an' she went out. It\r\nwasn't ten minutes, but when she came back Pete an' the child weren't\r\nthere. She ran to the door an' looked up an' down the street, but it was\r\ntwelve years before she ever saw that child again. Pete was gone a week,\r\nan' when he come home not a word would he say but that the child was\r\nsafe enough, an' he'd had enough of her round under foot. They had high\r\nwords. She told him he should never have another cent till Nan was\r\nbrought back, an' he went out swearin' an' cursin', to be brought home\r\nin half an hour past any tellin' in this world. He'd been knocked down\r\nan' run over by a fire-engine, an', though there was life enough left to\r\nlook at his mother an' try to speak, speak he couldn't.\r\n\r\n\"Well, there was nothin' that woman didn't do, far as her money would\r\ngo. She'd a nephew was a policeman, an' he hunted, an' plenty more, but\r\nnever a sign or a word. She couldn't get out much on account of the\r\nshop, but whenever she did there wasn't a beggar with a child that she\r\nwouldn't stop an' look with all her eyes to see if it might be Nan. You\r\nwouldn't think anybody would take a child that way to be tormented with,\r\nwhen there's hundreds runnin' round loose that nobody claims; but, for\r\nall that, it's done. Not as often as people think. There's more\r\nkidnappin' in the story-papers than ever gets done really, but it _does_\r\nhappen now and then. An' New York's a better place to hide in than\r\nanywheres out of it. I know plenty of places this minute where the\r\npolice couldn't find a man if they hunted a month.\r\n\r\n\"Pete Simpson took this child to a hole in the Five Points, rag-pickers\r\nan' beggars an' worse, an' gave her to a woman that took children that\r\nwas wanted out o' the way. He paid her a dollar, an' said she could make\r\nenough out of her to pay for the trouble, she was so fair-lookin'. She\r\nwas one of the women that sit round with a baby an' one or two children\r\nclose to her, mostly with laudanum enough to make 'em stupid.\r\n\r\n\"Nan was spirited, an' she screamed an' fought, but blows soon hushed\r\nher. She remembered, she's told me. She didn't know where she'd come\r\nfrom, but she knew it was clean an' decent, an' she wouldn't eat till\r\nhunger made her. Then there was a long time she came up with three or\r\nfour that made a kind of a livin' pickin' pockets an' a turn now an'\r\nthen as newsboys, or beggin' cold victuals an' pickin' up any light\r\nthing they could see if they were let in. Nan changed hands a dozen\r\ntimes, an' she never would have known where she come from if Charley\r\nCalkins hadn't kept half an eye to her. He was six years older, an'\r\nnobody knew who he belonged to; an' he an' Nan picked rags together, an'\r\nwhatever trick he knew he taught her. They cropped her hair, an' dirt\r\nhid all the prettiness there was, but by ten she'd learned enough to get\r\nany bit of finery she could, an' to fight 'em off when they wanted to\r\ncut her hair still. She'd dance an' sing to any hand-organ that come\r\nalong; an' that was where I saw her first--when she was twelve, I should\r\nthink--with a lot o' men an' boys standin' round, an' she dancin' an'\r\nsingin' till the very monkey on the organ danced too. I was in a house\r\non Cherry street then, with some girls that played at a variety theatre\r\non the Bowery, an' Nan by this time was so tall they'd made her a\r\nwaiter-girl in one of the beer-shops. It was there the theatre-man saw\r\nher one day goin' down to the ferry. He thought she was older, for she\r\nnever let on, an' she was tall as she ever was, an' her hair floatin'\r\nback the way she would always have it. She could read. She'd been to\r\nschool one term, because she would, an' she had a way with her that\r\nyou'd think she was twenty. So it didn't take long. The variety-man said\r\nhe'd make her fortune, an' she thought he would; an' next day she come\r\nan' told me she had agreed for three years.\r\n\r\n\"She didn't know there was work in it, but she soon found there was just\r\nas much drudgery as in the rag-pickin' or a beer-shop. But she had an\r\nambition. She said she'd started here, an' she would stay an' learn\r\neverything there was, but she believed she should be an actress in the\r\nOld Bowery yet. That seemed a great thing to me in those days, an' I\r\nlooked at her an' wondered if she knew enough, an' if she'd speak to us\r\nwhen she got there. She was so silent sometimes that it daunted us, an'\r\nthen she'd have spells of bein' wilder than the wildest; but she said\r\nstraight enough, 'I'm not goin' to stay down in this hole: I'm goin' to\r\nbe rich an' a lady; an' you'll see it.'\r\n\r\n\"The time came when she did get to the Old Bowery, an' the manager glad\r\nto have her too. The variety-man swore he'd kill her for leavin', for\r\nshe drew at the last bigger houses than he ever had again. How she\r\nlearned it all you couldn't tell, but the night we all turned out to see\r\nher in _The Rover's Bride_ you'd have said yourself she was\r\nwonderful--painted of course, and fixed off, but a voice that made you\r\ncry, an' a way just as natural as if she believed every word she said.\r\nAn' when she came out the third time, after such a stampin' an' callin'\r\nas you never heard, with her eyes shinin' an' _such_ a smile, I cried\r\nwith all my might.\r\n\r\n\"It was the very next day. Charley Calkins was bar-tender in a saloon,\r\nbut getting off whenever he could to see Nan act. That was another\r\nthing. She wouldn't take any fancy name, but was Nan Evans straight\r\nthrough--on the bills an' everywhere--an' every one she'd grown up with\r\nwent to see her, an' felt sort of proud to think she belonged to the\r\nFourth Ward. An' a strange thing was, that, though so many were after\r\nher, she never seemed to care for anybody but this Charley, that had\r\nknocked her round himself, though he wouldn't let anybody else.\r\n\r\n\"Well, the old woman that had taken her first was dyin'. She was\r\nCharley's aunt, an' so she sent for him, for want of any other relation,\r\nan' told him she'd a little money for him, an' was a mind to give a\r\nlittle to Nan. Charley said, 'All right!' He knew she most likely had a\r\ngood bit, for they often do, but then he said, 'You've always kept to\r\nyourself where you got Nan, an' I'm a mind to know.'--'Simpson's, up the\r\nBowery,' she said; an' that was the very last word she ever spoke. She\r\nleft thirteen hundred dollars in the Bowery Bank, an' it seemed as if\r\nthere were odd sums in every bunch of rags in the room, so that Charley\r\nhad enough to set him up pretty well. An' it didn't take him long after\r\nhe started his own saloon near the theatre to find out, among all the\r\nSimpsons, the woman that had had Nan. She had her store still, an' a\r\nyoung woman to help her, an' she cried a little when Charley told her.\r\nBut she was a member of the Mott Street Church, an' when she said,\r\n'Where is she now? and why don't she come herself?' an' Charley said,\r\n'She couldn't, because rehearsal's going on,' she looked at him.\r\n\r\n\"'Re-what?' says she.\r\n\r\n\"'Re-hearsal: she's an actress,' says he; an' she shut her eyes up as if\r\nthe sight of him after such words was poison.\r\n\r\n\"'I want nothing to do with her,' says she. 'I've had my fill of sorrow\r\nan' trouble from wickedness. You can go, an' say no more.'\r\n\r\n\"This didn't suit Charley, for he knew how Nan kept herself sort of\r\nrespectable even when she was with the worst, an' he was bound to find\r\nout all he could.\r\n\r\n\"Well, he hung on an' asked questions till he'd found out all there was,\r\nan' that was little, as you know. But Nan had wondered many a time where\r\nshe came from, an' if she'd ever belonged to anybody, an' he wanted to\r\nbe the first one to tell her. He scared the old lady, for he wasn't long\r\nfrom the Island, where he'd been sent up for assault an' battery, an',\r\ndo what you would to him, clothes nor nothin' could ever make him look\r\nlike anything but a rough. But he was bound to know, for he thought\r\nthere might be money belonging to her or folks that would do for her.\r\nThere wasn't a soul, though, that he could find out, an' the next thing\r\nwas to go to Nan an' tell her about it. They'd have been wiser to have\r\nwaited a day, till the old lady'd a chance to quiet down and think it\r\nall over; but he went straight to Nan an' told her he'd found some of\r\nher folks; an' she, without a word, put on her hat an' went with him. If\r\nshe'd been alone it might have been better, for Charley seemed worse\r\nthan he was. The old lady was in the room back of the shop, neat as a\r\npin, an' Nan looked as if she was looking through everything to see if\r\nshe could remember.\r\n\r\n\"An' when the old lady saw her there was a minute she cried again an'\r\ntook hold of Nan. 'It's her very look,' she said, 'an' her hair an'\r\nall;' but then she stiffened. 'I've no call to feel sure,' she said,\r\n'but if you are Nan, an' want to be decent, an' will give up all your\r\nwickedness, an' come here an' repent, I'll keep you.'\r\n\r\n\"'Wickedness?' Nan says, sort of bewildered--'repent?'\r\n\r\n\"'I don't know as it would do, either,' the old lady said, beginning to\r\nbe doubtful again. 'A lost creature, that's only a disgrace, so that I\r\ncouldn't hold my head up, any more'n I can when I think how Pete went: I\r\ncouldn't well stand it.'\r\n\r\n\"'You won't have to,' said Nan, with her head high. 'I did think I'd\r\nfound some folks, but it seems not;' an' out she went.\r\n\r\n\"Charley shook his fist an' swore. 'Nice folks, Christians are!' he\r\nsaid. 'I like 'em,----'em! I'd like to burn her shop over her head!'\r\n\r\n\"'Nonsense!' Nan said, as if she didn't mind a bit. 'I thought it would\r\nfeel good to have somebody I belonged to, but it wouldn't. I never could\r\nstand anything like her shaking her head over me; but it's strange how\r\nI've always been hoping, an' now how I don't care.'\r\n\r\n\"Then Charley told her she'd better go home with him: he'd got a\r\ncomfortable, nice place, an' he'd never bother her. They'd talked it\r\nover many a time, but she'd held off, always thinking she might find her\r\nfolks.\r\n\r\n\"Marriage didn't mean anything to either of them. How could it, coming\r\nup the way they had? though she'd never been like the other girls. You\r\ncan't think how they could be the heathen they were? Remember what\r\nyou've seen an' heard in this very place, an' then remember that ten\r\nyears ago, even, a decent man or woman didn't dare go up these alleys\r\neven by daylight, an' the two or three missionaries were in danger of\r\ntheir lives; an' you'll see how much chance they'd had of learning.\r\n\r\n\"Nan wasn't sixteen then, an' she didn't think ahead, though if she had\r\nlikely she would have done the same. She had her choice, but she'd\r\nalways known Charley, an' so it ended that way.\r\n\r\n\"Then came a long time when my own troubles were thick, an' I went off\r\nto the country an' lost sight of her. It was two years before I came\r\nback, an' then everything was changed. All that set I'd known seemed to\r\nhave gone to the bad together--some in prison and some dead. Jerry was\r\nout then, an' we were married an' began together in the little room down\r\nthe street; an' now I thought often of Nan. They told me Charley was\r\ndrinkin' himself to death, an' that she was at the theatre still, an'\r\nkept things goin' with her money, an' that he knocked her round, when he\r\nwas out of his head, the worst way. It wasn't long before I went to her.\r\nShe looked so beautiful you wouldn't think a fiend could want to hurt\r\nher, an' her eyes had just the look of that picture. I told her how I\r\nhad turned about, an' how happy we both were, in spite of hard times an'\r\nlittle work; but she listened like one in a dream, an' I knew enough to\r\nsee that I should have to tell her many times before she would\r\nunderstand or care. But she seemed so frail I couldn't bear to leave her\r\nso. An' the worst of it was, that she'd begun to wish Charley would\r\nmarry her, an' he thought it was all nonsense, an' swore at her if she\r\nsaid a word about it. She'd been gettin' more and more sensible, an'\r\nhe'd just been goin' the other way, but she kept her old fondness for\r\nhim. I said nothing then, but one day I found her cryin', an' her arm so\r\nshe could hardly move it; an' it came out he'd knocked her down, an'\r\ntold her she could clear out when she liked, for he was sick of her pale\r\nface an' her big eyes an' her airs, an' meant to bring a woman there\r\nwith some life in her.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Things don't come out as we plan,' she said. 'I was going to be a\r\nlady, but I forgot that anybody had anything to do with it but myself.\r\nAn' now I can't go to any decent place, an' Charley doesn't want me any\r\nlonger. See how nice it all looks here, Maria. I've fixed it myself, an'\r\nI've always been so glad that after the play was over I could come\r\n_home_--not to somebody else's room, but my own place--an' I never\r\nthought there was any reason why it wouldn't always be my place. Men\r\naren't like women. I was true to Charley, and I'll never think of\r\nanybody else; but he says I must get out of this.'\r\n\r\n\"Well, I wanted her to understand that I knew plenty would help her, an'\r\nI tried to tell her she could begin a different life; but she just\r\nopened her eyes, astonished at me.\r\n\r\n\"'You think I'd go to one of those Homes?' she said. 'You're crazy. I\r\ncan make my livin' easy enough at the theatre, even if I'm not so strong\r\nas I was. What have I done more than anybody, after all? Do you think\r\nI'd be pointed at an' talked over the way those women are? I'd throw\r\nmyself in the river first! I've learned enough these years. I go to\r\nchurch sometimes, an' hear men in the pulpit talk about things I know\r\nbetter than they do. I've found out what the good people, the\r\nrespectable people, are like. I've found out, too, what I might have\r\nbeen, an' that if I live a thousand years I never can be it in this\r\nworld; an' that's one reason I thought Charley might be willing to marry\r\nme. But I shall never say anything more now, for, you see, it isn't\r\ngoin' to make so very much matter. I had a bad cold in the spring, an'\r\nthe doctor said then I must be very careful or I should go with\r\nconsumption. See my arm? They said the other day I'd have to do\r\nsomething to plump up, but I never shall: I'm goin', an' I'm glad of\r\nit.'\r\n\r\n\"'Then, if that's got to be, let it be goin' home,' I said. 'Nan,\r\nthere's everything waitin' for you if you'll only take it. Come down to\r\none of the meetin's an' you'll hear. Won't you?'\r\n\r\n\"'I don't understand it,' she said. 'Everything's in a twist. Years an'\r\nyears and never hear of God, an' not a soul come near you to tell about\r\nHim, an' all at once they say He loves you, and always has. Bah! If He\r\nloved, an' people think about it as they pretend, how dare they let\r\nthere be such places for us to come up in? If God is what they say, He\r\nought to strike the people dead that keep Him to themselves till it is\r\ntoo late for us ever to be helped. There! I won't talk about it. I don't\r\ncare: all I want is quiet, an' I'll have it soon.'\r\n\r\n\"I saw there was no use then, an' I made up my mind. I'd seen this Mrs.\r\nSimpson, for Nan had told me when it all happened, an' I'd gone to the\r\nstore on purpose; an' I went straight there. 'I've come from Nan,' I\r\nsaid, 'but she doesn't know it. She's a dyin' girl, an' as you helped\r\nthe father I want you to help the daughter. You're a Christian woman,\r\nan' the only soul belongin' to her, an' the time's come to do\r\nsomething.'\r\n\r\n\"'The father was decent,' she said: 'I've nothing to do with\r\nstreet-women.'\r\n\r\n\"'It's through your own son that she grew up to know no better,' I said,\r\nfor I knew the whole story then, though nobody did when she was down\r\nthere. 'It's for you to give her your hand now, an' not throw it up to\r\nher, any more'n the Lord when he said, \"Go, and sin no more.\" She's in\r\ntrouble an' sick, and doesn't know what way to turn, an' sore-hearted;\r\nan' if you would go to her in the right way you might save a soul, for\r\nthen she'd believe people meant what they said.'\r\n\r\n\"'She's the same to me as dead,' she said. 'I mourned her sharp enough,\r\nbut it ain't in nature to take one again after they've been thought\r\ndead; an' you know they're straight from corruption itself. There's\r\nplaces for her to go if she's tired of wickedness, but I don't want to\r\nsee her bold face, an' her head high, as if she was respectable. An' I\r\ndon't want to be plagued no more. I don't deny I lotted on her before\r\nshe was took away, but I never want to think about her again; so you\r\nneedn't come nor send. I've said my say, an' I hope the Lord will save\r\nher.'\r\n\r\n\"'It's good He's more merciful than His creatures,' I said; an' I went\r\naway more angry than I ever want to get. I couldn't quite make it out--I\r\ncan't to this day--how she could mourn so over the child, an' yet never\r\nhave a thought for all the years she'd had to suffer.\r\n\r\n\"There came a month that everything crowded. I thought of Nan, but\r\ncouldn't go up, till one day Tom Owens came in--you know him--an' he\r\nsaid, 'It's all up with Charley Calkins.'\r\n\r\n\"'How?' I said.\r\n\r\n\"'Smallpox,' he said, 'an' Nan's dropped everything to nurse him. She'd\r\nleft there, they said, an' the woman he brought in to take her place\r\ncut the minute she found he had the smallpox. He won't live, they say.'\r\n\r\n\"This was before they were so particular about carrying them off to\r\nhospital. The house was cleared an' the saloon shut up, but Nan was\r\nallowed to stay because she'd been exposed anyway, an' it was no use to\r\nsend her off. He had it the worst way, an' he'd scream an' swear he\r\nwouldn't die, an' strike out at her, though he couldn't see, his face\r\nand eyes bein' all closed up. It didn't last but a week, and then he\r\ndied, but Nan hadn't taken off her clothes or hardly slept one instant.\r\nHe was stupid at the last, an' when she saw he was gone she fell on the\r\nfloor in a faint; an' when she come to the blood poured from her mouth,\r\nan' all they could do was to take her off to the hospital. She didn't\r\ntake the smallpox, but it was a good while before she could be let to\r\nsee anybody. When they thought it was safe she sent for me, but it was\r\nhard to think it could be the same Nan I'd known. Every breath come with\r\npain, and she was wasted to a shadow, but she smiled at me an' drew me\r\ndown to kiss her. 'You see, I sha'n't be troubled or make trouble much\r\nlonger,' she said, 'but oh, if I only could rest!'\r\n\r\n\"Poor soul! She couldn't breathe lyin' down, nor sleep but a bit at a\r\ntime, an' it was awful to have her goin' so, an' she not twenty.\r\n\r\n\"I knelt down by her. She had a little room to herself, for she had some\r\nmoney yet, and I prayed till I couldn't speak for crying. 'Nan, Nan!' I\r\nsaid, 'you're goin' straight to the next world, an' you've got to be\r\njudged. What will you do without a Saviour? Try to think about it.'\r\n\r\n\"She patted my hand as if I were the one to be quieted. 'Don't bother,'\r\nshe said: 'I don't mind, an' you mustn't. If He's as good as you say\r\nHe'll see that it's all right. I'm too tired to care: I only want to get\r\nthrough. There's nothing to live for, an' I'm glad it's 'most over. I\r\nwant you to come every day, for it won't be long.'\r\n\r\n\"'Let me bring Jerry,' I said, but she only laughed. She'd known him at\r\nhis hardest, an' couldn't realize he might be different; but after a\r\nweek or two she let him come, an' she'd lie an' listen with a sort of\r\nwonder as she watched him. But nothing seemed to take hold of her. She\r\nlooked like a flower lyin' there, an' you'd think her only a child, for\r\nthey'd cut her hair, and it lay in little rings all over her head; an'\r\nJerry just cried over her, to think that unless she hearkened she was\r\nlost. She liked to be read to, but you couldn't make her believe,\r\nsomehow, that any of it was real. 'I'd believe it if I could,' she said,\r\n'but why should I? I don't see why you do. It sounds good, but it\r\ndoesn't seem to mean anything. Why hasn't anybody ever told me before?'\r\n\r\n\"'Try to believe, only try!' I'd say. 'Ask God to make you. He can, and\r\nHe will if you only ask;' but all she'd say was, 'I don't seem to care\r\nenough. How can I? If it is true He will see about it.'\r\n\r\n\"That was only a day or two before the end. The opium, maybe, hindered\r\nher thinkin', but she looked quiet an' no sign of trouble between the\r\ncoughing-times. The last night of all I stayed with her. They said she\r\nwould go at daybreak, an' I sat an' watched an' prayed, beggin' for one\r\nword or sign that the Lord heard us. It never came, though. She opened\r\nher eyes suddenly from a half sleep, and threw out her hands. I took\r\none, but she did not know me. She looked toward the east and smiled.\r\n'Why! are you coming for me?' she said, and then fell back, but that\r\nlook stayed--a smile as sweet as was ever on a mortal face. An' that's\r\nwhy I never can help sayin', 'Lord have mercy on her!' and do you wonder\r\neven when I know better? But--\"\r\n\r\nHELEN CAMPBELL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMY TREASURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Under the sea my treasure lies--\r\n    Only a pair of starry eyes,\r\n    That looked out from their azure skies\r\n    With innocent wonder, sweet surprise,\r\n    That they should have strayed from Paradise.\r\n\r\n    Under the sea lies my treasure low--\r\n    Little white hands like flakes of snow,\r\n    Once soft and warm; and I loved them so!\r\n    Ah! the tide will come and the tide will go,\r\n    But their tender touch I shall never know.\r\n\r\n    Under the sea--oh, wealth most rare!--\r\n    Are silken tresses of golden hair,\r\n    Each amber thread, each lock so fair,\r\n    Gleaming out from the darkness there,\r\n    With the same soft light they used to wear.\r\n\r\n    Under the sea--oh, treasure sweet!--\r\n    Lies a curl-crowned head and tiny feet\r\n    That in days gone by, when the shadows fleet\r\n    Were growing long in the darkening street,\r\n    Came bounding forth their love to meet.\r\n\r\n    And I sometimes think, as down by the sea\r\n    I sit and dream, that there comes to me\r\n    From my darling a message that none may see,\r\n    Save those who can read love's mystery\r\n    By Nature written on leaf and tree.\r\n\r\n    Strange things to my spirit-eyes lie bare\r\n    In the azure depths of the summer air:\r\n    Through the snowy leaves of the lily fair\r\n    Gleams her pure white soul, and I compare\r\n    Its golden heart to her sunny hair.\r\n\r\n    The perfume nestling among the leaves,\r\n    Or blown on the wind from the autumn sheaves,\r\n    Is her spirit of love, my soul believes;\r\n    And while my stricken heart still grieves\r\n    That gentle presence its pang relieves.\r\n\r\n    A shell is cast by the waves at my feet,\r\n    With its wondrous music low and sweet;\r\n    And in its murmuring tones I greet\r\n    The voice of my love, while its crimson flush\r\n    From her fair young cheek has stolen the blush.\r\n\r\n    Mid white foam, tossed on the pebbly strand,\r\n    I catch a glimpse of a waving hand:\r\n    'Tis a greeting that well _I_ understand;\r\n    But to those who see not the soul of things\r\n    'Tis only the spray which the wild wave flings.\r\n\r\n    The pearl's rare whiteness, the coral's red,\r\n    From the brow and the lip of my beautiful dead\r\n    Their soft tints stole when her spirit fled;\r\n    And it seems to me that sweet words, unsaid\r\n    By my darling, gleam through the light they shed.\r\n\r\n    Thus down by the sea, in the white sunshine,\r\n    While the winds and the waves their sighs combine,\r\n    I sit, and wait from my love a sign;\r\n    And a message comes to my waiting eyes\r\n    From under the sea where my treasure lies.\r\n\r\nH. L. LEONARD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON SPELLING REFORM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe agitation for \"reform\" in English spelling continues, but, so far,\r\nwithout involving anything that can be properly called discussion.\r\nDiscussion implies argument on both sides--a striking by twos. Most of\r\nthe appeals to the public on this subject, whether through the\r\nnewspapers and magazines or on the platform, have been made by the\r\nadvocates of the movement. The other side, if another side there be, has\r\nbeen comparatively silent, uttering occasionally only words of dissent.\r\nI presume this follows a law of Nature: those who favor movement move,\r\nand those who desire peace keep it and are still. But it ought not to be\r\ninferred that the noise made by the \"spelling reformers\" is\r\nrepresentative of the scholarship of the country, or that the silence of\r\nthe conservatives indicates acquiescence in all the propositions\r\nsuggested and urged by the radicals. There is much that can be said that\r\nhas not been said. Some late announcements on the part of those who\r\nadvocate the evisceration of the English language and literature are of\r\na kind to call for some reply. I have no desire, at present, to enter\r\ninto an elaborate discussion of the merits or demerits of the new\r\ndeparture in literature. The present agitation is only a skirmish, and\r\nought not to be dignified by the title of a battle: whether we shall\r\nhave a battle on this skirmish-line remains to be seen.\r\n\r\nIn the January number of the _Princeton Review_ there appeared a paper\r\nfrom the pen of Professor Francis A. March in commendation of the\r\n\"reform.\" The professor is one of the most active as well as able of\r\nthose who have spoken on that side, and, while he incidentally and\r\nmodestly crowns Mr. George P. Marsh as chief of the movement, his\r\nfellow-soldiers, if they are wise, will bestow the crown upon him. In\r\nthe article referred to the professor emphasizes his earnestness by\r\nsecuring the printing of his admirable paper in the peculiar orthography\r\nhe advocates. This orthography is practically the same as that advocated\r\nand contended for by the American Philological Association and the\r\nSpelling-Reform Association. Any criticism, therefore, of the peculiar\r\northography of the professor's paper is a criticism of the adopted\r\northography of the whole body of \"reformers,\" so far as they are agreed,\r\nfor in some details they still disagree.\r\n\r\nThe readers of the professor's paper will notice that in a large number\r\nof words the usual terminal _ed_ is changed to _t_. This is in\r\naccordance with one of the rules recommended by the Spelling-Reform\r\nAssociation and laid down authoritatively by the American Philological\r\nAssociation. The phraseology of the rule is to make the substitution\r\nwhere-ever the final _ed_ \"has the sound of _t_.\" It is to the\r\nprofessor's application of this rule that I now desire to call the\r\nattention of the reader. The \"reformers\" write _broacht, ceast,\r\ndistinguisht, establisht, introduçt, past, prejudiçt, pronounçt, rankt,\r\npluckt, learnt, reduçt, spelt, trickt, uneartht_, and assert that they\r\nwrite the words as they pronounce them. In the rule given by the A.P.A.\r\nfor the substitution of _ed_ for _t_, _lasht_ and _imprest_ are given as\r\nexamples.\r\n\r\nAll of us are undoubtedly aware of the ease with which the sound\r\nrepresented by _ed_ can be reduced to a _t_-sound in vocalization. But\r\neven if the sound of _t_ is given at the termination of the words named,\r\nnot much is gained by the \"reform\" in the actual use of the words. On\r\nthe contrary, it adds another tangle in the skein which children at\r\nschool must untangle. It either forms another class of regular verbs, or\r\nswells the already almost unmanageable list of irregular verbs. In\r\neither case it is shifting the burden from the shoulders of adults to\r\nthose of children, already, as the reformers tell us, overburdened and\r\noverworked. When a man really and sincerely asks himself the question,\r\n\"Do I pronounce _lashed_ as though written _lasht_?\" and tests his own\r\npractice in that respect, it will not take him long to determine that he\r\ndoes not know. It requires a very delicate ear to make the\r\ndetermination. This may also be said of most of the words quoted above.\r\nThe terminal _ed_ means something: it means what it purports to mean\r\nwhen used. The _t_ may have a meaning, but that meaning cannot accompany\r\nit when it acts as a substitute for _ed_. The common-sense view would\r\nbe, in cases of doubt, to use letters with a significance you desire to\r\nconvey by their use.\r\n\r\nIn the paper to which I have referred Professor March informs us that\r\n\"what _the scholars_ want for historical spelling is a simple and\r\nuniform fonetic system, which shall record the current pronunciation.\"\r\nThis assumption is not accidental, I think, nor is the spirit of the\r\nPharisee confined to Professor March. Nearly all of the advocates of\r\nthis special \"reform\" assume the prerogative of determining who are and\r\nwho are not \"scholars.\" In the same paper the professor says: \"The\r\n_scholars proper_ have, in truth, lost all patience with the\r\netymological objection. 'Save us from such champions!' says Professor\r\nWhitney: 'they may be allowed to speak for themselves, since they know\r\nbest their own infirmity of back and need of braces: the rest of the\r\nguild, however, will thank them for nothing.'\" Again: \"In conclusion, it\r\nmay be observed that it is mainly among _half-taught dabblers_ in\r\nfilology that etymological spelling has found its supporters. _All true\r\nfilologists_ and filological bodies have uniformly denounçt it as a\r\nmonstrous absurdity, both from a practical and a scientific point of\r\nview.\" The professor also quotes approvingly Professor Lounsbury as\r\nsaying that the \"spelling reform numbers among its advocates _every\r\nlinguistic scholar_ of any eminence whatever.\" Of course, these\r\nstatements, whether made by Professor March or by the distinguished\r\nscholars whom he cites, are strong arguments. That the professor so\r\nconsiders them is attested by the logical conclusion drawn from them in\r\nthe very next paragraph after the one in which they are given. There he\r\nsays: \"It may be taken, then, as certain, and agreed by all whose\r\njudgment is entitled to consideration, that there are no sound arguments\r\nagainst fonetic spelling to be drawn from scientific and historical\r\nconsiderations.\"\r\n\r\nWe always forgive something to enthusiasts and reformers. They are\r\nexpected to effervesce once in a while, and when they indulge in gush\r\nand self-appreciation it is taken as a matter of course. Whether or not\r\nit strengthens or weakens their arguments is yet to be determined. At\r\nany rate, the exhibit that is made of them and of their intemperance is\r\nfurnished by themselves.\r\n\r\nThere is an illogical argument for the new spelling drawn from the\r\npublished facts of illiteracy. We are told that the last national census\r\nreports 5,658,144 persons, ten years of age and over, who cannot read\r\nand write, and this number is said to be \"one-fifth of the whole\r\npopulation.\" The census of 1870 reports a total population of\r\n38,558,371, and a total of illiterates, ten years of age and over, of\r\n5,660,074, which is only 14-1/2 per cent. of the total population. This\r\nis nearer one-seventh than one-fifth. This \"one-fifth\" the professor\r\ncompares with the number of illiterates in other countries in order to\r\nbring discredit upon the English language, showing by the comparison\r\nthat there is a larger percentage of illiterates where the English\r\nlanguage is spoken and written than in non-English Protestant countries.\r\nHe reports illiterates in England at 33 per cent. of the population. \"In\r\nother Protestant countries of Europe they are comparatively few. In\r\nSwitzerland, Denmark, Sweden and Norway there are none to speak of; in\r\nGermany, as a whole, they count 12 per cent., but some of the states\r\nhave none.\" Professor March asserts that \"one of the causes of the\r\nexcessive illiteracy among the English-speaking people is the difficulty\r\nof the English spelling;\" and his argument proceeds on the assumption\r\nthat this is in fact the main cause.\r\n\r\nEven if assent be given to the statement that the difficulty attendant\r\nupon the acquisition of correctness in English orthography is one of the\r\ncauses of English and American illiteracy, the next step is to determine\r\nthe force and efficiency of the cause in that direction; and this\r\ndetermination cannot be had on the basis of bald, unguarded and\r\nextravagant statements such as I have cited. The illiteracy of the\r\nAmerican people must not be judged by the bare figures given above. The\r\ncensus returns furnish data for a more just discrimination. The\r\nstatistician must not forget the item of 777,864 illiterates of foreign\r\nbirth going to swell the grand total. This leaves 4,882,210 native-born\r\nilliterates--a percentage of less than 13. Of the native-born\r\nilliterates reported by the census returns, there are 2,763,991 reported\r\nas colored. This number is more than one-half the colored population,\r\nand also over one-half of the whole number of reported native\r\nilliterates. I think none of the reformers would insist that the\r\nilliteracy of the colored population ought to be charged to \"the\r\ndifficulties of English spelling \"--I hardly need to state why: the\r\nreason will readily suggest itself to all.\r\n\r\nEliminating from the problem the foreign and colored factors, we find a\r\nnative white population in 1870 of 28,121,816, and native white\r\nilliterates, of ten years of age and over, to the number of\r\n2,102,670--less than 7-1/2 per cent. Of this number of native white\r\nilliterates, 1,443,956--two-thirds of the whole--are reported from the\r\nStates lately known as Slave States. In these States, as is well known,\r\nthere are peculiar reasons for the illiteracy of the white as well as of\r\nthe colored native, outside of any consideration of the difficulty of\r\nmastering English orthography. This survey takes no account of the\r\nnative children with foreign parents, as it would not materially disturb\r\nthe percentage, nor of the populations of New Mexico, Arizona, Southern\r\nCalifornia and Colorado, all largely settled by Mexicans and Spaniards,\r\namong whom there is doubtless a larger percentage of illiterates than\r\namong the same number of native whites in the Northern States. If\r\naccount be taken of all these elements, I think the percentage of\r\nilliterates proper to be charged up to the English language and American\r\ninstitutions would be reduced to about 3-1/4 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe next consideration is as to the cause of this large percentage of\r\nilliterates among the native white population of the United States.\r\nProfessor March ascribes it in part to \"the difficulties of the English\r\nspelling,\" and he adds: \"We ar now having ernest testimony to this fact\r\nfrom scholars and educators in England.\" He names Max Müller and \"Dr.\r\nMorell, one of Her Majesty's inspectors of schools,\" and quotes from\r\nboth of them. Dr. Morell states that in some examinations for the civil\r\nservice, out of 1972 failures, \"1866 candidates were pluckt for\r\nspelling; that is, eighteen out of every nineteen who faild, faild in\r\nspelling.\" Max Müller, as quoted, bears testimony to the fact that in\r\nthe public schools of England 90 per cent. fail \"to read with tolerable\r\nease and expression a passage from a newspaper, and spell the same with\r\ntolerable accuracy.\" This is the substance of the \"ernest testimony\"\r\nfrom \"scholars and educators in England.\" All this testimony has been\r\npreviously given by the same \"reformer\" and by others without variation\r\nor corroboration. The facts stated seem to be isolated ones, as well as\r\n\"grand, gloomy and peculiar.\" One swallow does not make a summer, nor do\r\none eminent philologist and one uneminent educator make \"scholars and\r\neducators.\" But when the testimony is carefully viewed, what does it\r\namount to? Some of the very elements necessary in the consideration of\r\nthe testimony are wanting. What was the extent of the failures by the\r\ncandidates for civil service? Did they miss one word or more? Were they\r\nmore deficient in spelling than in other branches? Of the 90 per cent.\r\nof the public-school pupils who failed, what is the class composing\r\nthose pupils? Were they as deficient in other branches as in spelling?\r\nWhat were the newspaper passages selected for trial? What is meant by\r\n\"tolerable ease and expression\" and \"tolerable accuracy\"? According to\r\nthe testimony itself, the reference of Max Müller is to the \"new\r\nschools\" established since the late extension of education in England.\r\nConfessedly, then, this applies to classes of pupils who had formerly\r\nbeen deprived of educational advantages and privileges. It is a wonder\r\nthat 10 per cent. were successful. The testimony furnished is more\r\n\"ernest\" than valuable.\r\n\r\nThe state of education in Protestant countries where other languages\r\nthan the English are spoken is taken as a conclusive argument for the\r\nefficiency of phonetic orthography. Denmark, Norway, Sweden and\r\nSwitzerland are named as shining exemplars in this regard. It is because\r\nthe languages of those countries are orthographic models that the people\r\nare so highly educated. The general fact is incontrovertible that among\r\nthose people there is less illiteracy than among those who speak the\r\nEnglish language. As Switzerland has no national language, the Swiss\r\npeople should not have been named except in company with those others\r\nwhose languages they use. But the bare fact of the smaller percentage of\r\nilliteracy among the people above named is not conclusive as to the\r\nretarding and depressing influence which the \"difficulties of English\r\nspelling\" have upon the spread of education among the American people.\r\nIn Denmark attendance upon school for seven years by every child of\r\nschool age is compulsory. The number of children of school age for 1876\r\nwas 200,761, while the number in attendance upon the public schools was\r\n194,198, the attendance being 96 per cent. of the whole number of\r\nchildren of school age. In addition to the attendance upon the public\r\nschools, there were 13,994 in attendance upon private schools: some of\r\nthese evidently were above or below school age. We thus see how\r\nefficiently the compulsory system is enforced. This system is not new to\r\nthat country, but has been in existence for many years, and the results\r\nseem to justify the statement in the _Report of the Commissioner of\r\nEducation for 1871_, that \"even among the lower classes a remarkable\r\nknowledge of general history and geography, but more especially of\r\nScandinavian literature and history,\" is found.\r\n\r\nIn Norway, as in Denmark, from the eighth to the fifteenth year\r\nattendance upon school is obligatory. In 1866, of a total of 212,137\r\ncountry children of school age, 206,623, or more than 97 per cent. of\r\nthe whole, were in attendance at school. In the towns and cities less\r\nthan 1 per cent. failed to attend school. In Sweden compulsory\r\nattendance upon school is the rule. In 1868, of the whole number of\r\nchildren of school age, the average attendance amounted to 97 per cent.\r\n\r\nThere is no general or national system of common-school instruction in\r\nSwitzerland. Each canton regulates its own schools. There, as in\r\nDenmark, Norway and Sweden, attendance upon schools is made compulsory.\r\nIn 1870 the attendance of children between six and thirteen years of age\r\nwas between 95 and 96 per cent. of the whole school population.\r\n\r\nNow, what kind of a school system have we in the United States? Here, as\r\nin Switzerland, there is no general or national system of school\r\ninstruction. Each State regulates its own schools in all details. In\r\n1870 the total school population, excluding the Territories, in the\r\nUnited States was 14,093,778; the number actually enrolled in the public\r\nschools was 8,881,848, or 63 per cent. of the whole; and the average\r\ndaily attendance upon the public schools was 4,886,289, or a little over\r\n34-1/2 per cent. of the school population. An inclusion of the\r\nTerritories in the computation does not vary the percentage in any\r\nappreciable degree. In the Northern States only, excluding the\r\nTerritories, and excluding also Minnesota and Wisconsin, whose returns I\r\nhave not at hand, there were 8,364,841 school population, while the\r\naverage daily attendance was only 3,720,133, a trifle over 44 per cent.\r\n\r\nIn the United States there is practically no compulsory attendance upon\r\nschool. Schools are provided by the State, and the children attend or\r\nrefrain from attendance as suits the convenience or wish of the pupils\r\nor their parents. That compulsory attendance upon school is productive\r\nof a wider and more thorough diffusion of knowledge is probably conceded\r\nby all. At least, educators so urge. What would Professor March have?\r\nDoes he expect to find education as thorough and general among a people\r\nof whose school population less than one-half are in usual attendance at\r\nschool, and less than two-thirds even enrolled as occasional attendants\r\nat school, as among a people with whom over 95 per cent. of the school\r\npopulation are in constant and habitual attendance? When we consider the\r\npublished school statistics of this nation, it is no wonder that about\r\none-seventh of the whole are unable to read and write. Shall we give no\r\ncredit to compulsory systems of education, and still insist that the\r\nilliteracy of the United States is caused in any appreciable degree by\r\nthe \"difficulties of English spelling\"?\r\n\r\nEarly in 1879, Professor Edward North assured us that the Italians and\r\nSpaniards have discarded _ph_ for _f_ in _philosophy_ and its fellows.\r\nProfessor March gleefully records that \"the Italians, like the\r\nSpaniards, have returned to _f_. They write and print _filosofia_\" for\r\n_philosophia_, and _tisica_ for _phthisica_. Professor Lounsbury, in his\r\nelaborate articles in _Scribner_ lately, commends the Italians for\r\nwriting _tisico_ and the Spaniards for writing _tisica_. These of course\r\nare commendations of those peoples for the simplicity of their\r\northography, and they are mentioned as worthy examples for us. Yet we\r\nare not advised by either of the three professors named that the\r\nItalians and Spaniards are for that reason gaining upon the English\r\npeople in intelligence, educational progress and culture. No statistics\r\nare advanced disclosing the narrow percentage of illiteracy found in\r\nItaly and Spain, and a comparison made between that narrow percentage\r\nand the wide percentage already advertised as existing in\r\nEnglish-speaking states. If \"the difficulties of English spelling\" be a\r\nserious cause of illiteracy in England and the United States, the\r\nsimplicity of the Italian and Spanish spelling ought to be a cause of\r\nhigh proficiency in literary and educational attainments among the\r\npeople of Italy and Spain. A commendation of those two nations for their\r\ntaste in discarding \"Greek orthography\" to be effective ought to be\r\nsupplemented with some evidence of the usefulness of that operation.\r\nUnless so supplemented, the commendation can have no weight as an\r\nargument. The Anglo-Saxon race has not been accustomed to follow the\r\nLatins in literary and educational matters. The past and present\r\ncondition of those two countries affords no guarantee that their\r\nadoption of the so-called simpler spelling is commendable. There are\r\npersons whose corroboration of a statement adds no weight to it with\r\ntheir neighbors. It adds no force to the arguments of the \"reformers\"\r\nthat the Italians and Spaniards endorse them.\r\n\r\nThe demand for \"spelling reform\" is based upon the assumption that the\r\npronunciation constitutes the word--in other words, that the real word\r\nis the breath by means of which it is uttered. In the word _wished_\r\nphilologists assure us that the letters _e d_ are remains of _did_, as\r\nif it were written _did wish_; and it certainly has that sense. It is\r\nproposed to substitute _t_ for the _ed_, because, we are told by the\r\n\"reformers,\" the _t_ represents the sound given to those two letters. Of\r\ncourse the _t_ stands for nothing: it does not represent any idea. It is\r\nonly a character, and its pronunciation only a breath, without any\r\nsignificance. The new word cannot mean _did wish_. The \"reformers\" must\r\ncontend that _wisht_ is the real word, or their position cannot be\r\nmaintained for an instant. If the word still remains _wished_--\"_did\r\nwish_\"--though pronounced _wisht_, their proposition to conform the\r\nspelling to the pronunciation is laughable. There can be no conformation\r\nand the old words remain. Whenever a change is made in a single letter\r\nof a word, the word is broken: it is no longer the same word. The new\r\nform becomes a new word, and there can be no objection to any one giving\r\nto it any significance he chooses. In a certain sense, and also to a\r\ncertain extent, letters are representative, and are not the real words.\r\nBefore the arts of writing and printing were invented the sound of\r\ncourse constituted the representative of the idea sought to be conveyed.\r\nThe invention of the arts of writing and printing brought into use other\r\nrepresentatives of ideas. The cuneiform characters and the\r\nhieroglyphics were representatives of ideas, though there could be no\r\npronunciation of them. Letters came into use as representatives merely.\r\nIn an age of printing it is hardly correct to say that they are only\r\nused to signify sounds. They are now more than that: they have become\r\nmore important than the sounds even. They are now representatives of\r\nideas, and not of sound. Modifications of pronunciation are taking\r\nplace, and there are variations in the pronunciation of many words, but\r\nthe word as written and printed is the arbiter.\r\n\r\nIn the Sanscrit we find the verb _kan_ to see, and the later word _gna_,\r\nto know, as the result of seeing. The words are practically spelled\r\nalike, each beginning with a guttural sound. The latter could only have,\r\nat first, the idea of acquiring or possessing knowledge by sight. It is\r\nevident that the Greek [Greek: gignôschô] and the Latin _gnosco_ came\r\ndirectly from the Sanscrit _gna_, after the vowel between the guttural\r\n_g_, or _k_ and _n_, had been eliminated; and it is also evident that\r\nthe _g_, or guttural sound, with which _gna_ and its Greek and Latin\r\nchildren began, was vocalized. The other branch of the Aryan family\r\nretained the vowel between the guttural sound and the terminal _n_.\r\nHence we have the Gothic _kunnan, kænna_, Anglo-Saxon _cunnan_, German\r\n_kennen_, to examine, to know. Hence, also, our _can_, to know, to be\r\nable; _cunning_, knowing, skilful; and _know_, to perceive, to have\r\nknowledge of. While we pronounce _know_ without the guttural sound, the\r\nword itself and the significance it embodies necessitate the continued\r\nuse of the _k_. The sound of _know_, as we use it, gives no idea of\r\nsight or of knowledge or of ability. When we hear it articulated, and we\r\nunderstand that _know_ is the word meant, we then recognize the sense\r\nintended to be conveyed. We are able to do this because of our ability\r\nto construct and give arbitrary significance to new words, and to\r\ntransfer the sense of an old word to one newly formed. When any word is\r\nused in speech of which the pronunciation does not correspond with the\r\nletters with which the word is written, we instinctively image the\r\nwritten or printed word in the mind, and others apprehend the sense\r\nintended. I am aware of a certain answer that may be made to\r\nthis--namely, that illiterate persons are able to understand a word only\r\nfrom its sound as it falls on their ears; but I am speaking now of a\r\ncivilized language as used by a civilized people, and illiterates and\r\ntheir language do not come under this purview.\r\n\r\nThe movement inaugurated by Professor March and his associates\r\ncontemplates the displacement of the _k_ or guttural sound from _know_\r\nand _knowledge_, both in writing and speaking. They say, in effect, if\r\nnot in so many words, that because there is no guttural sound in the\r\npronunciation, therefore there is none in the word. Some people say\r\n_again_, pronouncing the word as it is spelled: others say _agen_, as, I\r\nbelieve, Professor March does. These two classes mean the same thing,\r\nbut it is quite evident that they do not say the same thing. _Ai_ cannot\r\nbe the equivalent of _e_. To so hold would be to make \"confusion worse\r\nconfounded\" in English orthography. By one class of literary people\r\n_neither_ is pronounced as though the _e_ were absent, and by another\r\nclass as though the _i_ were not present. No one, I think, will contend\r\nfor the identity, or even equivalence, of _i_ and _e_. If not identical\r\nor equivalent, they must be different. If _ai_ is different from _e_,\r\nthen _again_ and _agen_ cannot be the same word, and if _i_ and _e_ are\r\nneither identical nor equivalent, _nither_ and _neether_ are two\r\ndifferent words. The logic of the \"reformers\" would bring the utmost\r\nconfusion into the language. It would make two separate words identical\r\nin significance. It would make into one word with four different\r\nmeanings the four words _right, rite, write, wright._ The words _signet_\r\nand _signature_ are formed from the stem _sign_, and yet the stem when\r\nstanding alone has a different vocalization from what it has when used\r\nin the derivative words. By the logic of the \"reformers\" the word _sign_\r\nwhen used alone is not the same as the same letters, arranged in the\r\nsame order, when used in _signature, signet, resignation_ and the like.\r\nThe word is changed, but the original significance remains. When a\r\nperson responds, even in writing, \"It is me,\" grammarians say he is\r\nincorrect--that he ought to say \"I.\" But he means the person and thing\r\nhe would mean if he said \"I.\" He simply spells \"I\" in a different way.\r\nIs he not just as correct as he who writes _no_ when he means _know_? or\r\nhe who writes _filosofer_ when he means _philosopher_?\r\n\r\nBut Professor March dogmatically says that \"fonetic spelling does not\r\nmean that every one is to write as he pronounces or as he thinks he\r\npronounces. There ar all sorts of people. We must hav something else\r\nwritten than 'confessions of provincials.'\" This may be understood as\r\nmodifying the idea expressed earlier in the same paper, that the proper\r\nfunction of writing \"is truthfully to represent the present speech.\" But\r\nthe difficulties to be encountered in an effort to make the present\r\nspeech homogeneous will baffle the wisdom of the reformers. I will not\r\nanswer the question now--I will only ask it: What is the present speech?\r\nWho is to determine that? \"The scholars formally recognize that there is\r\nand ought to be a standard speech and standard writing.\" I do not quite\r\nseize the idea embodied in the above-quoted sentences about writing as\r\nwe think we pronounce and about \"confessions of provincials.\" We may\r\nagree that there ought to be, probably, a standard speech, both spoken\r\nand written. That we have the standard written speech must be confessed,\r\nor did have until Professor March and his colaborers began the\r\npublication of their ideas in \"bad spelling.\" The spoken speech is far\r\nfrom homogeneity. Some of the most pretentious scholars assume that we\r\nhave a standard of pronunciation. That the standard is not adhered to,\r\nand is therefore, to all intents and purposes, no standard at all, is\r\nevident. The learned or college-bred use one pronunciation, and for that\r\nclass that is the standard. Those who are deficient in education do not\r\nfollow that standard. As the educated seem to drift naturally to centres\r\nof population, there is assumed to be a city standard and a country\r\nstandard of pronunciation. The professor tells us that the country\r\nstandard must be abolished, the city standard adopted, and then the new\r\nera will open out in beauty. Or does he mean, as his words are open to\r\nthis meaning, that a spoken word is not _the_ word unless it is spoken\r\nin accordance with the city or college-bred standard? But sound is\r\nsound, by whomsoever uttered, and if the word is mere sound a provincial\r\ncan make words as well as any one else. The proposition is, _the_ word\r\nis the word spoken and not the word written, unless the word is spoken\r\nby a provincial. To be _the_ word, it must be intoned and articulated in\r\naccordance with the intonation and articulation of the _literati_. If\r\nthis is the logical outcome of the position taken by the \"spelling\r\nreformers,\" then we know our soundings.\r\n\r\nWe speak of _progress_ in connection with intellectual, moral,\r\nreligious, social and political matters and civilization. In the use of\r\nthe word we discard its true meaning, \"stepping forward\" in a physical\r\nsense. We cannot have an idea that the mind or the morals or the manners\r\ntake steps. So when we say we will consider a matter we do not\r\nnecessarily mean that two or more of us will _sit together_ about the\r\nmatter. When we meet for _deliberation_ there is no process of weighing\r\nintended, no proposal to use the scales, in arriving at a conclusion in\r\nthe matter we have in mind. We _say_ \"stepping forward,\" \"sitting\r\ntogether\" and \"weighing,\" but we _mean_ something else. When Professor\r\nWhitney, in the quotation I have given in the early part of this paper,\r\nsays of the spelling conservatives, \"They know best their own infirmity\r\nof back,\" he has no idea that the back has anything to do with their\r\nrefusal to follow him in his chimerical ramble after an ideal\r\northography. When Professor March, in the paper from which I have\r\nquoted, says that \"a host of scholars are pursuing the historical study\r\nof the English language,\" he means something more than, and different\r\nfrom, what his words indicate, and he certainly doesn't mean what his\r\nwords do indicate. The matter of pursuit is altogether one of physics.\r\nThese words of an intellectual significance which I have noted are so\r\nused because we have no words in our language which have meanings such\r\nas those we attach to them. We are obliged to take words of a physical\r\nand material significance and use them as intimations of the sense we\r\nwish to convey. As men take a material substance--gold, silver, ivory,\r\nwood or stone--and use it as an image or symbol of the deity they\r\nworship, so we use words of a material sense to express, in some faint\r\ndegree, the intellectual and moral ideas we desire to disclose.\r\n\r\nThe bald statement, expressed or implied, that the sounds we produce in\r\nour attempts to utter a word constitute the true word, requires some\r\nmaterial modification, but to what extent it is not for me now to\r\ndiscuss. When that necessity for modification is admitted by the\r\nreformers, it is for them to survey its limits. They are the aggressors\r\nin the contest that is precipitated. They must outline and define their\r\nown case.\r\n\r\nThere are many considerations favorable to a modification of the present\r\nspelling of several classes of words. A reform is needed, and must come,\r\nbut it will not come, and ought not to come, with the character and to\r\nthe extent desired by the \"reformers.\" A reform that shall make the\r\nspelling better, and not merely make it over, should be aided by all\r\nadmirers of the English language. The just limitations of that reform\r\nhave not been indicated yet by any of the \"reformers.\" That those\r\nlimitations will soon be surveyed and marked I do not doubt.\r\n\r\nM. B. C. TRUE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN OPEN LOOK AT THE POLITICAL SITUATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nMacaulay, in describing the rise of the two great parties which have\r\nalternately governed England during the last two centuries, traces the\r\ndivision to a fundamental distinction which \"had always existed and\r\nalways must exist,\" causing the human mind \"to be drawn in opposite\r\ndirections by the charm of habit and the charm of novelty,\" and\r\nseparating mankind into two classes--those who are \"anxious to preserve\"\r\nand those who are \"eager to reform.\" It seems to us extremely doubtful\r\nwhether this theory, so neat and compact, so simple to state and so easy\r\nto illustrate, would suffice to explain all the struggles, great and\r\nsmall, that have agitated society, varying in character and\r\ncircumstances, and ranging from fervent emulation to violent\r\ncollision--from the ferment of ideas which is the surest sign of\r\nvitality to the selfish and aimless convulsions that portend\r\ndissolution. Applied to that condition of things by which it was\r\nsuggested, the theory may be allowed to stand. The history of\r\nparliamentary government in England, in recent times at least, presents\r\na tolerably fair example of a contest between two parties composed\r\nrespectively of men who desired and men who resisted innovation--of\r\nthose who looked forward to an ideal future and those who looked back to\r\nan ideal past. That the former should triumph in the long run lay in the\r\nvery necessity of things; but, whatever may be thought of the changes\r\nthat have taken place, no one would venture to assert that the contest\r\nhas ever been conducted with purely selfish aims; that no great\r\nprinciples were involved in it; that the general mass of the voters have\r\nbeen the mere tools of artful leaders; that appeals to the reason, or at\r\nleast to the interests or the prejudices, of the whole nation or of\r\ndifferent classes have been wanting on either side; that at any crisis\r\nthere has been no discussion of measures, past or prospective, no talk\r\nof any question concerning the honor or welfare of the country; or that\r\nvictory has ever been achieved or contemplated by the employment of\r\nmere cunning or fraud. But in a state of things of which one might\r\nassert all this without fear of contradiction the existence of two\r\nparties, however evenly balanced, could hardly be accounted for by the\r\nsway in opposite directions of the charms of habit and of novelty and\r\nthe natural antagonism between men who are anxious to preserve and men\r\nwho are eager to reform. That such a state of things may actually exist\r\nthere can be no doubt, since, if history had no example to offer in the\r\npast, one which is equally undeniable and conspicuous is presented by\r\nthe United States at the present moment. Here is a people divided into\r\ntwo great parties, neither of which is anxious to preserve what the\r\nother would seek to destroy, or eager to reform anything which the other\r\nwould leave untouched; no principle involving any question or policy of\r\nthe present or the future is inscribed on the banner of either; no\r\ndiscussions are held, no appeals are put forth, with the object of\r\nconvincing opponents, stimulating supporters, creating public opinion or\r\narousing public sentiment: a great struggle is at hand, and all that any\r\none knows about the nature of it is, that it concerns the possession of\r\nthe government, and that the chiefs of the winning faction will reward\r\nas many as possible of their most active adherents by confirming them in\r\noffice or appointing them to office--this being the one feature of the\r\nmatter in which the \"charm of habit\" and \"the charm of novelty\" have a\r\nvisible influence.\r\n\r\nWe shall probably be told in reply that this state of things is only\r\nmomentary; that there is now a suspension of arms preparatory to the\r\ndecisive conflict; that on each side, while the great host of warriors\r\nis at rest, the chiefs are in consultation, counting up their resources,\r\npreparing the plan of battle--above all, selecting the generalissimo;\r\nand that when these arrangements are completed and the time of action\r\ndraws near the trumpets will give forth no uncertain sound, banners\r\nemblazoned with the most heart-stirring devices will be advanced, and\r\nwe shall fall into line according as our temperaments and sympathies\r\nincline us to join with those who are \"anxious to preserve\" or with\r\nthose who are \"eager to reform.\" It is of course certain that a few\r\nweeks hence the aspect will have changed in some respects: we shall have\r\nbeen told the names of the \"candidates\" whom we are to support or\r\noppose; we shall hear all that can be learned or imagined about their\r\ncharacters and acts, and see them painted by turns as angels and demons;\r\nwe shall also be reminded of the traditions which they represent or are\r\nfigured as representing, and shall be assured that certain shibboleths\r\nand watchwords should be the objects of our veneration and certain\r\nothers of our abhorrence, and that on our choice between them will\r\ndepend the ruin or salvation of the country. But we shall be no wiser\r\nthen than we are now in regard to any one measure or set of measures\r\naffecting the welfare of the nation, and tending either to preserve or\r\nto reform, which one party proposes to carry out and the other to\r\nreject. The proclamations of each will be full of promises and\r\ndisavowals, but these, it is very certain, will not touch a single\r\nprinciple of the least importance which will be disputed by the other.\r\nEach party will parade its \"record,\" its glorious achievements in the\r\npast, when it carried the country triumphantly through dangers in which\r\nthe other party had involved it; but on neither side will any\r\ndistinctive line of policy be enunciated, for the simple reason that on\r\nneither side has any distinctive line of policy been conceived or even\r\nthought of. Finally, it is not at all certain that the battle will be\r\ndecided by the usual and regular methods of political warfare--that \"the\r\nwill of the majority\" will be allowed to express itself or suffered to\r\nprevail--that fraudulent devices or actual violence may not ultimately\r\ndetermine the result.\r\n\r\nThe inquiry naturally suggests itself how this state of things has been\r\nbrought about--above all, whether it is, as many intelligent persons\r\nseem to suspect, an unavoidable outgrowth of democratic institutions.\r\nThis, indeed, is a question important not only to us, but to all the\r\ncivilized nations of the world, for there is nothing more certain in\r\nregard to the present tendencies of civilization than that they are\r\nsetting rapidly and irresistibly toward the general adoption of\r\ndemocratic forms of government. The oldest and greatest of the European\r\nnations, after trying almost every conceivable system, has returned, not\r\nso much from a deliberate preference as from the breakdown of every\r\nother, to that which had twice before failed as an experiment, but which\r\nnow gives fair promise of successful and permanent operation--a republic\r\nbased on universal suffrage. In many other countries what is virtually\r\nthe same system in a somewhat different form seems to be firmly\r\nestablished, and in these the ever-potent example of France may be\r\nexpected at some more or less remote conjuncture to bring about the\r\nfinal change that shall make the form and the name coincide with the\r\nreality. England, which at one time led the van in this movement, has\r\nbeen outstripped by several of the continental nations, but its\r\nconstant, though somewhat zigzag, advances in the same direction cannot\r\nbe doubted, while community of race and former relations make the\r\ncomparison between its condition and prospects and those of the United\r\nStates more mutually interesting and instructive than any that could be\r\ninstituted between either and another foreign country.\r\n\r\nWe are aided in making this comparison by a lecture delivered recently\r\nbefore the Law Academy of Philadelphia, and since published as a\r\npamphlet, in which form we hope it may obtain the wide circulation and\r\ngeneral attention which it well merits. In a rapid sketch of the\r\ndevelopment and present working of the English constitution the author,\r\nJudge Hare, shows how the government, which, in theory at least, was\r\noriginally a personal one, has come to be parliamentary and in the\r\nstrictest sense popular, that branch of the legislature which is elected\r\nby the people having raised itself from a subordinate position \"to be\r\nthe hinge on which all else depends, controlling the House of Lords,\r\nselecting the ministers and wielding through them the power of the\r\nCrown.\" Hence a complete harmony, which whenever it is broken is\r\ninstantly restored, between the executive and the legislature, the\r\nlatter in turn being the organ of the public sentiment, which acts\r\nthrough unobstructed channels and can neither be defied nor evaded. In\r\nAmerica, on the other hand, to say nothing of those organic provisions\r\nof the Constitution which render the executive and the two branches of\r\nthe legislature mutually independent, and sometimes, consequently, out\r\nof harmony with each other, divergent in their action and liable to an\r\nabsolute deadlock, the method by which it was directly intended to\r\nsecure the result that has been fortuitously obtained in\r\nEngland--namely, the selection of an executive by a deliberative\r\nassembly chosen by the people--has been practically subverted and its\r\npurpose utterly frustrated. The Electoral Colleges do not elect, but\r\nmerely report the result of an election. This, on the surface, is a\r\nchange in the direction of a more complete democracy. What was devised\r\nas a check on the popular impulse of the moment has broken down, and the\r\npeople have taken into their own hands the mission they were expected to\r\nentrust to a small representative body. But, while thus assuming an\r\napparently absolute freedom of choice, they virtually, and we may say\r\nnecessarily, surrendered to small, nominally representative, bodies the\r\ndesignation of the persons between whom the choice must be made. These\r\nbodies, unknown to the Constitution, not elected or convoked or\r\nregulated by any processes or forms of law, have taken upon themselves\r\nall the functions of the electors, except that it is left to the people\r\nto throw the casting vote. Now, whatever may be thought of the actual\r\nworkings of this system, it seems to us to be in itself the result of a\r\nchange as natural and legitimate as any that has taken place in the\r\npractice of the English constitution. The Electoral College was one of\r\nthose devices which are theoretically simple and beautiful, but which\r\nhave never worked beneficially since the world began; and we have\r\nperhaps some reason to be grateful that it was virtually superseded\r\nbefore it had time to become the focus of intrigue and corruption which\r\nwas otherwise its inevitable fate. Since the choice of a President could\r\nnot be remitted to one or both Houses of Congress--which would have been\r\nthe least objectionable plan--and has devolved upon the people, some\r\nprevious process of sifting and nominating is indispensable in order\r\nthat there may be a real and effective election; and we do not see that\r\nany method of accomplishing this object could have been devised more\r\nsuitable in itself or more conformable to the general character of our\r\npolitical system than that which has been adopted. Conventions\r\nrepresenting the great mass of the electors and various shades of\r\nopinion might be counted upon to select the most eligible\r\ncandidates--eligible, that is to say, in the sense of having the best\r\nchance amongst the members of their respective parties of being elected.\r\nFor a long period this system worked sufficiently well. If the ablest\r\nmen were not put forward, this was understood to be because they were\r\nnot also the most popular. If the mass of the voters were not\r\nrepresented in the conventions, this was attributed to their own\r\nindifference or negligence. If a split occurred, leading to the\r\nnomination of different candidates by the same party, this was the\r\nresult of a division of sentiment on some great question, and might be\r\nconsidered a healthy indication--a proof that the interests, real or\r\nsupposed, of the country or some section of the country were the objects\r\nof prime consideration.\r\n\r\nWe do not, therefore, agree with those who hold that our institutions\r\nhave deteriorated, or with those who think that democracy has proved a\r\nfailure. On the contrary, we believe that a simpler democratic system,\r\nwith fewer checks and balances, would be an improvement on our present\r\nConstitution. The framers of that Constitution had two apprehensions\r\nconstantly before their minds--one, that of a military usurper\r\noverthrowing popular freedom; the other, that of an insurrectionary\r\npopulace overthrowing law and government. Experience has shown that\r\nneither of these dangers could be realized in a country and with a\r\npopulation like ours: the elements of them do not exist, nor are the\r\noccasions in the least likely to arise. The two great evils to which we\r\nare exposed are a breakdown of national unity and a decay of political\r\nlife. The former evil--resulting from the magnitude of the country, the\r\nconflict of interests in its different sections, the State organizations\r\nand semi-sovereignty, and the consequent lack of that strong\r\ncentralization of administrative powers and functions which, however\r\nmuch of a bugbear to many people's imaginations, is indispensable to a\r\ncomplete nationality--has threatened us in the past and may be expected\r\nto threaten us in the future. The latter evil threatens us now.\r\n\r\nIf we turn to England, we see political life in its fullest vigor. The\r\nrecent election called forth nearly the entire force of the voting\r\npopulation, and the contest was carried on with well-directed vigor and\r\namid almost unparalleled excitement. Questions affecting both domestic\r\nand foreign policy, and felt to be vital by the whole community, were\r\nardently, persistently and minutely discussed in public meetings and at\r\nthe hustings; and the general nature of the issue indicated with\r\nsufficient clearness the maintenance of the old division throughout the\r\nbulk of the nation between a party anxious to preserve and a party eager\r\nto reform. Men of the highest character and distinction in every walk of\r\nlife were among the most ardent participants in the struggle; but no\r\ncrowds of office-holders and office-seekers opposed each other _en\r\nmasse_ or were prominent in the struggle, the former having as a class\r\nnothing to fear, and the latter as a class nothing to hope, from the\r\nresult. So far was the leader of the opposition from being suspected of\r\na mere selfish desire to grasp the position to which in case of victory\r\nhis pre-eminent ability and activity entitled him that it was altogether\r\ndoubtful whether he would be willing to accept it. He and all the other\r\nmen who marshalled or exhorted the opposing lines stood forth as the\r\nacknowledged representatives of certain principles and public measures,\r\nand in that capacity alone were they assailed or defended. The contest\r\nwas decided by strictly legal methods; no suspicion existed as to the\r\ninviolability of the ballot-boxes or the correctness and validity of the\r\nreturns; and the cases in which corrupt or undue influence was charged\r\nwere reserved for the adjudication of impartial tribunals.\r\n\r\nNo one supposes that the impending struggle in the United States will be\r\nof this nature. There is no question before the country involving the\r\npolicy of the government or the interests of the nation. There are no\r\nleaders who are the representatives of any principle or idea. The ardor\r\nof the contest will be confined to the men whose individual interests\r\nare directly or indirectly at stake: the management of the contest will\r\nbe wholly in their hands, and no security will be felt as to the\r\nlegality of the result. Whatever display of popular enthusiasm may be\r\nmade will be chiefly of a factitious nature. Such excitement as may be\r\nfelt will be to a large extent of the kind which is awakened by a \"big\r\nshow\" or an athletic contest. The general mass of the voters will no\r\ndoubt fall into line in response to signals and cries which, though they\r\nhave lost their original meaning, still retain a certain efficacy, but a\r\ngreat falling off from the old fervor and discipline will, we venture to\r\nthink, be almost everywhere apparent. More intelligent persons will\r\neither stand aloof with conscious powerlessness or strike feebly and\r\nwildly from a sense of embitterment. The energy put forth will indicate\r\ndisease rather than health; the activity exhibited will be not so much\r\nthat of a great organism as of the parasites that are preying on it.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be denied that there is in this country a natural tendency\r\ntoward political stagnation. With the exception of slavery and the\r\nquestions arising from it--which fill, it is true, a large space in our\r\nhistory, but which must be considered abnormal in their origin--there\r\nhas never been any great and potent cause of dissension, such as rises\r\nperiodically in almost every country in Europe, setting class against\r\nclass, changing the form or character of the government and shaking the\r\nfoundations of society. In England a gradual revolution has been always\r\ngoing on, and there have been several struggles even in the present\r\ncentury where a popular insurrection loomed in the background and was\r\naverted only by concession. Our institutions, on the contrary, have\r\nundergone no change and been exposed to no danger in any fundamental\r\npoint. They were accepted by the whole people, and their stability was a\r\nsubject of national pride. There were two great parties, each of which\r\nscented in every measure projected by the other a design to unsettle the\r\nbalance between the States and the general government, but both claimed\r\nto be the guardians of the Constitution, and their mutual rancor was\r\nfounded mainly on jealousy. But for the existence of slavery, and the\r\ninevitable antagonism provoked by it, there must have been a constant\r\ndecrease of interest in political questions as it became more apparent\r\nthat these could not affect the freedom and security which, coupled with\r\nthe natural advantages of the country, afforded the fullest scope and\r\nstrongest stimulant to industrial activity. The extinction of slavery\r\nwas the cutting away of an excrescence: the wound under a proper\r\ntreatment was sure to heal, and even under unwise treatment Nature has\r\nbeen doing her work until only a scar remains. Painful, too, as was the\r\noperation, its success has given the clearest proof of the health and\r\nvigor of our system, thus increasing the tendency to political\r\ninactivity and an over-exertion of energy in other directions. This in\r\nitself seems not to be a matter for alarm: if the latent strength be\r\nundiminished we can dispense with displays of mere nervous excitement.\r\nAnd, in point of fact, the latent strength is, we believe, undiminished;\r\nonly, there is no general consciousness that it needs to be put forth,\r\nstill less any general agreement as to how it should be put forth.\r\n\r\nWhat has happened is, that not only has the stream of political activity\r\nbeen growing languid, but its channel is becoming choked. The noisome\r\natmosphere that exhales from it causes delicate people to avert their\r\nnostrils, timid people to apprehend a universal malaria, and many people\r\nof the same and other classes to assert that the sluices are not merely\r\ndefective, but constructed on a plan totally and fatally wrong. Some\r\nbold and sagacious spirits have, however, taken the proper course in\r\nsuch cases by examining the obstructions and determining their nature\r\nand origin. According to their report, the difficulty lies not in any\r\ngeneral unsoundness of the works, but in the failure to detect and stop\r\na side issue from certain foul subterranean regions, the discharge from\r\nwhich becomes copious and offensive in proportion as the regular flood\r\nis feeble and low. In plainer words, we are told that the mode in which\r\nplaces in the public service are filled and held has made the active\r\npursuit of politics a mere trade, attracting the basest cupidities,\r\nconducted by the most shameless methods, and putting the control of\r\npublic affairs, directly or indirectly, into impure and incompetent\r\nhands. This view has been so fully elaborated, and the facts that\r\nconfirm it are so abundant and notorious, that further argument is\r\nunnecessary. It is equally clear that the state of things thus briefly\r\ndescribed has no necessary connection with democratic institutions. The\r\nspread of democracy in Europe has been attended by a gradual\r\npurification in the political atmosphere. The system of \"patronage\" had\r\nits origin in oligarchy, and wherever it is found oligarchy must exist\r\nin reality if not in name. Instead of being an inherent part of our\r\ninstitutions, it is as much an excrescence, an abnormal feature, as\r\nslavery was; but, unlike that, it might be removed with perfect safety\r\nand by the simplest kind of operation.\r\n\r\nHere, then, is a question worthy to come before the nation as an issue\r\nof the first magnitude. Here is a thing affecting the interests of the\r\nwhole country which some men are anxious to preserve and which others\r\nare eager to reform. It remains only to consider how it can best be\r\nbrought before the nation.\r\n\r\nWe shall perhaps be told that it is already before the nation; that the\r\naccount we have given of the nature of the approaching contest is\r\nincorrect or incomplete; that on the skirts of the two parties is a body\r\nof \"Independents,\" carrying the banner of Reform and strong enough to\r\ndecide the contest and give the victory to whichever party will adopt\r\nthat standard as its own.\r\n\r\nNow, we have to remark that the tactics thus proposed have been tried\r\ntwice before. Eight years ago the Reformers allied themselves with the\r\nDemocratic party, which accepted their leader--chosen, apparently,\r\nbecause he was neither a Reformer nor a Democrat--and the result was not\r\nonly defeat, but disgrace, with disarray along the whole of the combined\r\nline. Four years ago they adhered to the Republican party, having\r\nsecured, by a compromise, the nomination of Mr. Hayes. Apart from the\r\nfact that Mr. Hayes was not elected, but obtained the position which he\r\nholds through, we will say, \"the accident of an accident,\" his\r\npossession of the Presidency has not advanced the cause of Reform by a\r\nhair's-breadth. We do not need to discuss his appointments or his views\r\nor his consistency: it is sufficient to say that he has had neither the\r\npower nor the opportunity to institute Reform, and that no President,\r\nwhile other things are unchanged, _can_ have that power and opportunity.\r\nThe truth is, that there is a great confusion, both as to the object\r\nthey have to aim at and as to the means of accomplishing it, in the\r\nminds of the Reformers. They talk and act continually as if their sole\r\nand immediate object were to secure the appointment to office of men of\r\ndecent character and ability, and as if the election of a particular\r\ncandidate for the Presidency, or even the defeat of a particular\r\ncandidate, would afford a sufficient guarantee on this point. They are\r\n\"ready to vote for any Republican nominee but Grant,\" and, in case of\r\nhis nomination, to vote, we suppose, for any Democratic nominee but\r\nTilden--certainly for Mr. Bayard. It may be safely admitted that no\r\npossible candidate for the Presidency enjoys a higher reputation for\r\nprobity and general fitness for the place than Mr. Bayard--one reason,\r\nunhappily, why he is not likely to be called upon to fill it. But,\r\nsupposing him to be raised to it, what is one of the first uses he may\r\nbe expected to make of it if not to turn out the solid mass of\r\nRepublican office-holders and fill their places with Democrats? If Mr.\r\nHayes, with whom the Reformers have been at least partially satisfied,\r\nhad succeeded to a Democratic administration, can it be doubted that he\r\nwould have made a similar change in favor of the Republicans? Is not\r\nevery President bound by fealty to his party, consequently by a regard\r\nfor his honor and reputation, to perpetuate a system which the true aim\r\nof Reform is to abolish?\r\n\r\nEven if we should concede, what it is impossible to believe, that a\r\nPresident personally irreproachable might be trusted to make no unfit\r\nappointments, this would not reach the source of the evils of which we\r\nhave to complain, which lies in the _method_ by which appointments are\r\nmade and in the _tenure_ by which they are held. So long as the system\r\nof \"patronage\" and \"rotation in office\" prevails, little real\r\nimprovement even in the civil service can be looked for. But improvement\r\nof the civil service, important as it is in itself, is an insignificant\r\nobject of aspiration compared with the general purification of political\r\nlife, the elevation of the public sentiment, the creation of a school of\r\nstatesmanship in that arena which is now only a mart for hucksters,\r\nbargaining and wrangling, drowning all discussions and impeding all\r\ntransactions of a legitimate nature. The class who fill that arena and\r\nblock every avenue to it cannot be dispossessed so long as the system\r\nwhich furnishes the capital and material for their traffic remains\r\nunchanged. It is a matter of demonstration that if the civil service\r\nwere put on the same footing as in England and other European countries,\r\nthe machinery by which parties are now governed, not led, public spirit\r\nstifled, not animated, legislation misdirected or reduced to impotence,\r\nand \"politics\" and \"politician\" made by-words of reproach and objects of\r\ncontempt, must decay and perish. We are not setting up any ideal state\r\nof things as the result, but only such as shall show a conformity\r\nbetween our political life and our social life, exhibiting equal defects\r\nbut also equal merits in both, affording the same scope to honorable\r\nambition, healthy activity and right purpose in the one as in the other.\r\nWe are not calling for any change in the character of our institutions\r\nor one which they afford no means of effecting, but the removal by a\r\nmethod which they themselves provide of an incumbrance which impairs\r\ntheir nature and impedes their working. No partial measure will\r\nsuffice--none that will depend for its efficacy on the disposition of\r\nthose whose duty it will be to enforce it--none that will be exposed to\r\nthe attacks of those whose interest it will be to reverse it. The end\r\ncan be secured neither by the action of the President nor by that of\r\nCongress. Reform, in order that it may endure and bear fruit, must be\r\nengrafted on the organic law, its principles made the subject of an\r\namendment to the Constitution, in which they should have been originally\r\nincorporated.\r\n\r\nIt may be urged in reply that the present action of those who desire\r\nReform is of a preliminary character; that they are simply grasping the\r\ninstruments with which the work is to be done; that the ultimate object\r\ncan be achieved only in the distant future, when the nation has been\r\naroused to a sense of its necessity. But the question arises, Is their\r\npresent action consistent with their principles and suited to advance\r\ntheir purpose? When they stand between the opposite parties, dickering\r\nwith each in turn, ready to accept any candidate but one that either may\r\nput forward, inciting people by the prospect of their support to violate\r\ntheir pledges, are they introducing purer methods or giving their\r\nsanction to those which are now in use? Will any nomination they may\r\nobtain by such means bring the question squarely before the nation?\r\nWould a President elected by their aid be recognized by the country as\r\nthe champion of Reform? Are they more likely to \"capture\" the party with\r\nwhich they connect themselves or to be captured by it? If they give\r\ntheir aid to the Democrats, will they expect the Democrats in return to\r\ngive aid to the cause of Reform? If they support a Republican candidate\r\nsatisfactory to themselves, will not the lukewarmness or disaffection of\r\nlarge sections of the party ensure his defeat? If the \"best man\" on each\r\nside be nominated, are the Reformers secure against a division and\r\nmelting away of their own unorganized and easily-disheartened ranks?\r\nWill the victory, in any case, be other than a party victory, leaving\r\nthe fruits to be reaped and further operations to be planned by those\r\nwho have organized and conducted the campaign?\r\n\r\nWe know well that it is only in a distant future that Reform can hope\r\nfor a complete and assured success. But it is in a distant future that\r\nthe greatest need for it, and with that need its opportunity, will\r\narise. Serious as are the present effects of the virus that has stolen\r\ninto our system, its malignant character and fatal tendency are apparent\r\nonly to those who have made it the subject of a careful diagnosis. This\r\nin part accounts for the apathy of the great mass of the people under a\r\nstate of things which in almost any other country would lead to a\r\nprofound and general agitation. Another cause lies in the consciousness\r\nof a power to remedy all such evils by peaceful and ordinary methods;\r\nand a third, in the present lack of any organization for applying those\r\nmethods. This lack will be supplied, and the first step toward a remedy\r\ntaken, when, instead of a body of \"Independents\" making no direct appeal\r\nto the people, treating alternately with each of the two existing\r\norganizations, and liable to be merged in one or the other, we have a\r\nReform Party standing on its own ground, assuming a distinctive\r\ncharacter, refusing any junction or compromise with other parties, and\r\ntrusting to the only means consistent with its aim and capable of\r\nattaining it. Eight years ago there was a junction with the Democrats,\r\nfour years ago a compromise with the Republicans, and one or other of\r\nthese courses is the only choice presented now. This policy can lead\r\nonly to defeat or to an empty and illusive victory, worse than defeat.\r\n\r\nHad a different policy been pursued in the past, the situation at\r\npresent would, we believe, be a very hopeful one. It is impossible not\r\nto see that the existing parties are undergoing a disintegration which\r\nwas inevitable from several causes, and which on one side at least would\r\nbe far more rapid if a third party stood ready to profit by it. One\r\ncause of this disintegration is the natural tendency to decay of\r\norganizations that have lost their _raison d'être_--that have ceased to\r\nembody any vital principle and consequently to appeal to any strong and\r\ngeneral sentiment. Another is the disgust inspired by the base uses to\r\nwhich they have been turned--a feeling shared by a far larger number of\r\nvoters than those who have already proclaimed their independence. A\r\nthird lies in the feuds among the leaders and managers of each party,\r\nwho, having no longer any principle to represent or any common cause to\r\ncontend for, have thrown away all pretence of disinterestedness and\r\ngenerous emulation and engaged in a strife of which the nature is\r\nundisguised and the effect easy to foresee. Thus it is that outraged\r\nprinciples work out their revenge, making their violators mutually\r\ndestructive, and clearing a way for those who are prepared to assert and\r\nmaintain them. In the Democratic party the breach may possibly be\r\nskinned over, though it can hardly be healed: in the Republican party it\r\nmust widen and deepen. The latter stands now in a position analogous to\r\nthat of the Whig party when it made its last vain attempt to elect its\r\ncandidate, and shortly after went to pieces, the mass of its adherents\r\ngoing over to that meagre band which in the same election had stood firm\r\naround the standard of Liberty. It is for the Reformers to say whether\r\nthey will contend for the inheritance which is legitimately theirs. With\r\na cause so clear they have no right to intrigue and no reason to\r\ndespair. They have on their side the best intelligence of the country,\r\nand consequently at their command the agencies which have ever been the\r\nmost potent in the long run. What they need is faith, concert and\r\nconsistency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR MONTHLY GOSSIP.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDELWEISS.\r\n\r\nEverybody has heard of it, and those who have been in Switzerland have\r\nseen in the shop-windows, if nowhere else, or in the hat of the man who\r\nleads their horse over the Wengern Alp, the little irregular,\r\nstar-shaped flower with thick petals that look as if they were cut out\r\nof white flannel. People may not be certain how its name is\r\npronounced--may call it _eedelwise_, or even _idlewise_--but as to its\r\nhabits every one is fully persuaded in his own mind; that is to say, if\r\none person believes that it grows on rocks, another is equally sure that\r\nit blooms under the snow, while in either case there is apt to be an\r\nimpression that it is found only in regions where the foot of the\r\nordinary tourist may not venture. The writer has found it, however, in\r\nvarious places perfectly accessible to good walkers or where a horse\r\ncould carry those not in that category. Edelweiss certainly likes to\r\ngrow among rocks, on the brink of a precipice or down the face of it,\r\nand out of reach if possible; but it will also nestle in the grass at\r\nsome distance from the brink, and may be found even where there is no\r\nprecipice at all.\r\n\r\nThe village of Zweisimmen is a quiet summer resort in the Upper\r\nSimmenthal, in the canton of Berne. The valley is green and peaceful,\r\nwith chalets dotted over all the mountain-sides: the rocks of the\r\nSpielgarten tower on the one hand, the snow of the Wildstrubel closes\r\nthe view to the south, where the Rawyl Pass leads to Sion in the valley\r\nof the Rhone, and, looking northward, the mountains grow more and more\r\nblue and distant in the direction of Thun. From Zweisimmen, on four\r\nexcursions, the writer and others have had the pleasure of picking\r\nedelweiss. First, at the Fromattgrat. Horses and saddles are forthcoming\r\nwhen required, and the four legs go as far as the scattered chalets of\r\nFromatt, the wide mountain-pasture which is reached after a steady\r\nascent of two hours and a half. Across from the chalets rises the _grat_\r\nor ridge where we have to seek our edelweiss. As we mount higher the\r\ngray masses of the Spielgarten seem very near: a fresh vivifying wind,\r\nthe breath of the Alps, makes one forget how warm it was toiling up the\r\ngorge. The clouds are drawing around in white veils and sweeping down\r\ninto the valley, quite concealing our destination at times, hiding even\r\nthe members of the party from each other if they separate themselves a\r\nlittle. Our fine day takes on a decidedly doubtful aspect: nevertheless,\r\nafter the first cry, \"Here's some!\" nobody thinks of impending\r\ndiscomforts. Here and there in the grass the soft white petals have\r\nopened, but where the _grat_ sinks straight down for hundreds of feet it\r\ngrows more abundantly, on the edge, and, alas! chiefly over the edge;\r\nand here a steady head and common prudence come in play. Furnished with\r\nthose requisites, we can collect a bunch of edelweiss, and go on our way\r\nrejoicing even though the rain-drops begin to fall, the wind grows\r\nwilder, and presently hail comes in cutting dashes anything but\r\nagreeable to one's features. We go back along the ridge and descend to\r\nthe broad-roofed chalet that lies invitingly below. It goes by the name\r\nof the Stierenberger Wirthschaft, and is known to all the cow-herds\r\nround; but we want no doubtful wine, only fresh milk and thick cream in\r\na wooden bowl, and a brown fluid called coffee. Bread we brought with\r\nus, not caring to exercise our teeth on last month's bake. In any case,\r\nnothing more solid than bread and cheese is to be found here, tavern\r\nthough it is. A fire blazes in the first room, which has no window, and\r\nmight properly be styled the antechamber of the cow-house, into which\r\nthere is a fine view through an open door. Sixty tails are peacefully\r\nwhisking to and fro, for in the middle of the day the cattle are housed\r\nto protect them from flies. All the implements of cheese-making--the\r\nimmense copper kettle, the presses, pails, etc.--are kept in the\r\nantechamber. After trying to dry ourselves at the hearth, and\r\ndiscovering that much hail comes down the great square chimney and very\r\nlittle smoke goes up, we are shown into the \"best room,\" the furniture\r\nof which consists of a bed, a pine table and benches. In the adjoining\r\napartment are two beds, the gayly-painted chest in which our hostess\r\nbrought home her bridal outfit, and another table; while in both rooms\r\nthe knives and forks are stuck in the chinks of the beams over the\r\nbenches--a convenient arrangement by which one has only to stretch up an\r\narm and take down from the ceiling whatever implement is needed. In most\r\nof these chalets a tall man might be embarrassed what to do with his\r\nhead: it is only necessary to go into their houses to perceive that the\r\nSwiss mountaineers are short of stature. When the hail and rain have\r\nceased we start downward over the hilly pastures, through pine woods and\r\nbeside a rushing stream, into the valley, and so back to Zweisimmen.\r\n\r\nAnother excursion was to go up to the same inn, and thence to a little\r\nlake at the foot of the Seeberg, where edelweiss is again to be found.\r\nAt Iffigen Lake it may also be had in abundance; and the fourth and last\r\noccasion on which we picked it was on the Rawyl Pass. From Zweisimmen\r\none drives to Lenk, whence the fine glaciers of the Wildstrubel are in\r\nfull view, then through the village and up a steep ascent, but a good\r\ncarriage-road still, to the beautiful Iffigen Fall. The water descends\r\nalmost perpendicularly over picturesque rocks from a great height,\r\nfalling in long arrows that seem to hesitate and linger in mid-air, and\r\nthen take a fresh swoop down: a rainbow spans it at the foot, where the\r\nmist rises. Here the carriage is left, and those who intend to ride take\r\nto the saddle. The way goes up steeply to the broad Iffigen Alp, shut in\r\non either hand by Nature's towering gray battlements. Having reached the\r\nchalets at the farther end of the pasture, we find ourselves facing the\r\nsolid rock and wondering what next. Over the brow of the lofty parapet\r\nfalls a little stream, looking like a white ribbon as it foams on its\r\ndizzy way. \"The path certainly cannot be there,\" we say; but, as it\r\nhappens, it is just there. It zigzags up, cut with infinite labor in the\r\nface of the mountain, like the famous Gemmi road from Loèche-les-Bains,\r\nonly that it is not so smooth and more picturesque. The Rawyl, like the\r\nGemmi, is sometimes given the reputation of a dangerous pass, but in our\r\nparty a lady rode the whole way without feeling the least uneasiness.\r\nThe path goes up and up until it crosses the waterfall, where one is\r\nshowered with cooling spray: soon after we are over the top of the rock\r\nand on plainer ground, but still mounting. A hut is passed where the\r\nguide says travellers can spend the night should it overtake them. There\r\nis indeed nothing to prevent their spending the night there, but also\r\nnothing to aid them in so doing: the place is uninhabited and\r\nunfurnished, the only sign that it is a shelter for human beings and not\r\nfor cattle being a tiny stove in one corner, with a pile of wood. Now a\r\nsmall green lake lies beside the way, and then the chalet on the summit\r\nis in sight, and a cross that marks the boundary between the cantons of\r\nBerne and Valais. There the highest point of our journey is reached in\r\ntwo and three-quarter hours from where the carriage was left, and we\r\nwalk nearly another hour on the level. Snow lies in wide fields in\r\nseveral places across the path: the pass is never wholly free from it,\r\nfor what is rain in the valley is apt to be snow at seven thousand nine\r\nhundred feet, the height of the Rawyl. During this part of the way the\r\nscene is most wild and impressive: the dark masses of the Mittaghorn,\r\nthe Rohrbachstein and Rawylhorn, and the dazzling glacier of the\r\nWildhorn rise majestically into blue space, while from the granite\r\nsummits to the very path under our feet there is nothing but rock, rock,\r\nrock! It is as if we were passing where the foot of man had never trod\r\nbefore, so solemn is the stillness here in the midst of the \"everlasting\r\nhills.\" To see one solitary bird flitting fitfully from point to point\r\nonly makes the loneliness seem greater, and it is absolutely touching\r\nto find in a place like this the lovely little _Ranunculus alpestris_\r\nand _Ranunculus glacialis_ forcing a way between the shingly stones and\r\nopening their delicate white petals to light and air. The purple\r\n_Linaria alpina_ keeps them company, but it is only farther on, and as\r\nwe come to green again, that asters, pansies and gentians gem the grass.\r\nWhere the way begins to descend to Sion there is an enchanting view into\r\nthe valley of the Rhone, and for a background to the picture a superb\r\nline of glaciers and snow-peaks, among them the Matterhorn. The path to\r\nSion can be traced for some distance down, but our party intended to go\r\nback by the way it came; and while we still lingered, wandering among\r\nthe knolls and rocks, we discovered edelweiss, faded and gray, however,\r\nfor in these regions the latter part of August is too late to find it in\r\nperfection.\r\n\r\nAs American ladies have the reputation of being poor pedestrians, it may\r\nbe of interest to add that ladies walked on all these excursions.\r\n\r\nG.H.P.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPOILED CHILDREN.\r\n\r\nIt will always remain a mystery to sensible people why, when they are\r\nheld to a rigid consistency, compelled to face palpable and indisputable\r\nfacts, and to acknowledge that under all circumstances two and two make\r\nfour, and never five, there is another class who from childhood to old\r\nage thrive on their mistakes, are never forced to pay the piper, and are\r\ngranted the privilege of counting the sum of two and two as four when\r\nconvenient, and five when they like, or a hundred if so it should please\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThese are the spoiled children of the world, whose fate it is to get the\r\nbest of everything without regard to their deserts. Others may be warm,\r\nmay shiver with cold, may be weary, may be ill, but they must not\r\ncomplain. The burden of lamentation comes from those who were never too\r\nwarm or too cold, never weary or ill, but who tremble lest in some cruel\r\nway they should be forced to suffer, and thus provide against it\r\nbeforehand. To these spoiled children the system of things in general\r\nhas no other design than to give them comfort in particular. And by some\r\nsubtle law of attraction the good things of the world are almost certain\r\nnaturally to gravitate toward them. They sleep well; they dine well;\r\nthey are petted by everybody; they have no despairs; they never suffer\r\nfrom other people's mishaps.\r\n\r\nA woman who marries one of these spoiled children may be sure of an\r\nopportunity to practise all the feminine virtues. She is certain to have\r\nbeen very much in love with him, for he was handsome, could dance and\r\nflirt to perfection, and was the very ideal of a charming lover. The\r\nlittle dash of selfishness in his ante-nuptial imperiousness and tender\r\ntyranny pleased her, for it seemed to be the expression of a more ardent\r\nlove than that of every-day men. It depends very much upon her\r\ngenerosity and largeness of heart whether she soon wakes up to the fact\r\nthat she has married a being destitute of sympathy, wholly careless and\r\nignorant of others' needs and requirements, full of caprices, allowing\r\nevery impulse to carry him away, and thoroughly bent on having his own\r\nwill and bending everybody about him to his own purposes.\r\nSelf-renunciation and absolute devotion and self-sacrifice are natural\r\nto women of a certain quality of intellect and heart, and possess the\r\nmost powerful charm to their imagination, provided they can have a dash\r\nof romance or a kindling of sentiment. Hence this form of martyrdom\r\noffers the female sex the pose in which it has sat for its portrait all\r\nthe centuries since civilization began, and the picture stands out\r\nimpressively against a background we all can recognize. As a school for\r\nheroism nothing can equal marriage with a spoiled child.\r\n\r\nBut, although probably quite as many instances may be found in one sex\r\nas in the other, the characteristics of a spoiled child are distinctly\r\nfeminine, and in no measure belong to robust masculinity. Thus, for a\r\nstudy, let us take a girl who from her cradle has found everything\r\nsubordinate to her princess-like whims, inclinations and caprices, and\r\nhas had her way by smiles and cajoleries or sobs and tears, as the case\r\nmay be. She finds out at an early age that it is pleasanter and more\r\nprofitable to be petted and pampered than to be forced to shift for\r\nherself. She learns that an easy little pitiful curve of her coral lips\r\nand upward glance of her baby orbs is answered by certain manifestations\r\nof tenderness and concern: thus she \"makes eyes,\" flirts, as it were,\r\nbefore she can talk, and studies the art of successful tyranny. The\r\nnursery--in fact, the entire house--rejoices when she rejoices and\r\ntrembles when she weeps. She wants everything she sees, and sulks at any\r\nsuperiority of circumstances in another; but then she sulks\r\nbewitchingly. Wherever she goes she carries an imperious sway, and keeps\r\nher foot well on the necks of her admirers.\r\n\r\nThe spoiled child blossoms into perfection as a young lady. That is her\r\ndestiny, and to the proper fulfilment of it her family and friends stand\r\nready to devote themselves. It may be they are a trifle weary of her\r\nincalculable temper, that her fascinations have palled a little upon\r\nthem, and that her mysterious inability to put up with the lot of\r\nevery-day mortals and bear disagreeables contentedly has worn out their\r\npatience. They want her to marry, and, without wasting any empty wishing\r\nupon a result so certain to come, she wants to marry herself. She is not\r\nlikely to have unattainable ideals: what she demands is a continuation\r\nof her petted existence--a lifelong adorer to minister to her vanity and\r\ndesires, to find her always beautiful, always precious, and to smooth\r\naway the rough places of life for her.\r\n\r\nNothing can be more bewitching than she is on her entrance into society.\r\nNothing could seem more desirable to an admirer than the possession of\r\nthe beautiful creature, who, with her alternations of sweetness and\r\nimperiousness, tenderness, and cruelty, stimulates his ardor and appears\r\nmore like a spirit of fire and dew than a real woman. It seems to him\r\nthe most delightful thing in the world when she confesses that she never\r\nlikes what she has, but always craves what she has not--that she hates\r\neverything useful and prosaic and likes everything which people declare\r\nshe ought to renounce. She is unreasonable, and he loves her\r\nunreason--it bewitches him: she is obstinate, and he loves to feel the\r\nstrength of her tiny will, as if it were the manifestation of some\r\nphenomenal force in her nature. Her scorn for common things, her\r\nfastidiousness, her indifference to the little obligations which compel\r\nless dainty and spirited creatures,--all act as chains and rivet his\r\nattachment to her.\r\n\r\nA few months later, when she has become his wife, and he is forced to\r\nlook at her tempers and her caprices, at her fastidiousness and\r\nexpensiveness, from an altered standpoint, her whole character seems to\r\nbe illuminated with new light. He no longer finds her charming when she\r\nhas an incurable restlessness and melancholy: her pretty negations of\r\nthe facts life present to her begin to seem to him the product of a mind\r\nundisciplined by any actual knowledge that she is \"a human creature,\r\nsubject to the same laws as other human creatures.\" He has hitherto\r\nconsidered that her scorn for the common and usual indicated an\r\nappreciation of the rarest and loftiest, but she seems to have no\r\nappreciation for anything save enjoyment. She has no idea of the true\r\npurposes of life: she likes everything dwarfed to suit her own stature.\r\nIt is not by compliance that her husband can give her more than\r\ntemporary pleasure. If she wants to see Europe, Europe will not satisfy\r\nher. \"Sense will support itself handsomely in most countries,\" says\r\nCarlyle, \"on eighteen pence a day, but for fantasy planets and solar\r\nsystems will not suffice.\"\r\n\r\nL.W.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRAYER-MEETING ELOQUENCE.\r\n\r\nWeekly prayer-meetings in New England villages offer a variety of\r\nsingular experiences to the unaccustomed listener, and it seems almost\r\nincredible at times that they can furnish spiritual sustenance even to\r\nthe devout. There are apt to be two or three among the regular\r\nattendants who being, according to their own estimate, \"gifted in\r\nprayer,\" raise their voices loud and long with many a mellifluous\r\nphrase and lofty-sounding polysyllable. Mr. Eli Lewis is one of the most\r\neloquent among the church-members in the village of C----, and if left\r\nto his own way would engross the entire evening with his prayers and\r\nexhortations. Nothing is too large for his imagination to grasp nor too\r\nsmall for his observations to consider. \"_O Lord, Thou knowest!_\" he\r\nrepeats endlessly, sometimes qualifying this statement by putting into\r\nthe next phrase, \"_O Lord, Thou art probably aware!_\" He is fond of\r\npoetry too, and frequently interpolates into his petition and\r\nthanksgiving his favorite verses. His fellow-worshippers are fully\r\nconscious of his excellent intentions, but there is some jealousy of the\r\nsurpassing length of his prayers. The other evening he was standing, as\r\nhis custom is, with his long arms upraised with many a strange gesture.\r\nHe had been on his feet half an hour already, and there began to be\r\nsigns of restlessness among the bowed heads around him. Still, there was\r\nno sign of any let up. He was engaged in drawing a vivid picture of the\r\ncondition of the universe in the abstract, the world in general and his\r\ncountry and native village in particular, and required ample time fully\r\nto elucidate his views regarding their needs, but proposed to illustrate\r\nit by quotations. \"O Lord,\" said he, \"Thou knowest what the poet Cowper\r\nsays--\" He paused and cleared his throat as if the better to articulate\r\nthe inspired strains of poetry, and began again more emphatically: \"O\r\nLord, Thou art probably aware what the poet Cowper says--\" but the\r\nsecond time broke off. He could not remember what it was the poet Cowper\r\nsaid, but with a view to taking the place his memory halted at, went\r\nback to the starting-place and recommenced: \"O Lord, Thou recollectest\r\nwhat the poet Cowper says--\" It was of no use: he could not think of it,\r\nand with a wild gesture put his hand to his head. \"O Lord,\" he exclaimed\r\nin a tone of excessive pain, \"_I cannot remember what the poet Cowper\r\nsays_,\" and prepared to go on with other matter; but Deacon Smith had\r\nbeen watching his opportunity for twenty minutes, and was already on\r\nhis feet. \"_Let us pray_,\" he said in a deep voice, which broke on\r\nBrother Lewis's ears with preternatural power, and he was obliged to sit\r\ndown while the senior deacon held forth. No sooner, however, had Deacon\r\nSmith's amen sounded than Mr. Eli Lewis started up. \"O Lord,\" he cried\r\nin a tone of heartfelt satisfaction, \"I remember now what the poet\r\nCowper says;\" and, repeating it at length, he finished his remarks.\r\n\r\nIt was Deacon Smith who one Sunday asked his pastor to put a petition\r\nfor rain into his afternoon prayer, as moisture was very much needed by\r\nthe deacon's parched fields and meadows. Accordingly, Dr. Peters, who\r\nwas something of a rhetorician, alluded in his prayer to the melancholy\r\nprospects of the harvest unless rain should soon be sent, and requested\r\nthat the Almighty would consider their sufferings and dispense the\r\nfloods which He held in His right hand. After service, as the reverend\r\ndoctor left the church, he saw Mr. Smith standing rigid in the porch,\r\nperhaps looking for a rising cloud, and remarked to him, \"Well, deacon,\r\nI hope our petition may be answered.\" He received only a snort of wrath\r\nand defiance in reply. Rather puzzled as to what had vexed his\r\nparishioner, Dr. Peters said blandly, \"You heard my prayer for a shower,\r\nDeacon Smith?\" The deacon turned grimly: \"I heard you mention the matter\r\nof rain, Dr. Peters, but, good Heavens, sir! _you should have insisted\r\nupon it!_\"\r\n\r\nA.T.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JARDIN D'ACCLIMATATION OF PARIS.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful garden, one of the most attractive places in the world,\r\nwas established in the Bois de Boulogne in 1860. It was in the most\r\nflourishing condition at the time of the breaking out of the war with\r\nGermany. That war nearly ruined it. During the siege elephants and other\r\nvaluable animals were sacrificed for food. The carrier-pigeons that did\r\nsuch noble service during the siege were mostly raised in this\r\nestablishment, and those that survived the war are kept there and most\r\ntenderly preserved. \"Many died gloriously on the field of honor,\" as we\r\nread in the records of the society, which preserve a full account of\r\ntheir wonderful feats. Some of them again and again dared the Prussian\r\nlines, carrying those precious microscopic despatches photographed upon\r\npellicles of collodion--so light that the whole one hundred and fifteen\r\nthousand received during the siege do not weigh over one gramme, a\r\nlittle over fifteen grains!\r\n\r\nThe great greenhouse of these gardens for plants that cannot endure a\r\ntemperature lower than two degrees below zero centigrade (28.4° Fahr.)\r\nwould enchant even the most indifferent observer. The building itself is\r\none of the finest structures of its kind. It was once the property of\r\nthe Lemichez Brothers, celebrated florists at Villiers, at which place\r\nit was known as the Palais des Flors. The Acclimatation Society\r\npurchased it in 1861, and every winter since then there has been a\r\nmagnificent and unfailing display of flowers there. Masses of camellias,\r\nrhododendrons, azaleas, primroses, _bruyères_, pelargoniums constantly\r\nsucceed each other. These are merely to delight the visitors, the great\r\nobject of the hothouse being to nurse foreign plants and experiment with\r\nthem. Among the rare ones are the paper-plant of the _Aralia_ family;\r\nthe _Chamærops_, or hemp-plant; the _Phormium tenax_, or New Zealand\r\nflax; and the _Eucalyptus_ of Australia, that wonderful tree introduced\r\nlately into Algeria, where it grows six mètres a year, and yields more\r\nrevenue than the cereals. This, at least, is what the official handbook\r\nof the garden says. It may be that the famous \"fever-plant\" has lost\r\nsome of the faith accorded to it at first.\r\n\r\nAt the end of this great greenhouse there is a beautiful grotto where a\r\nlittle brook loses itself playing hide-and-seek among the fronds of the\r\nmaiden-hair and other lovely ferns. At the right of this grotto is a\r\nreading-room where visitors may find all the current periodicals--on the\r\nleft, the library of the society, rich in works upon agriculture,\r\n_zootechnie_, natural history, travels, industrial and domestic economy,\r\netc., in several languages. The remarkable thing about this great\r\ngreenhouse is the ever-flourishing, ever-perfect condition of its\r\nvegetation. Of course this effect must be secured by succursal\r\nhothouses, not always open to visitors. No tree, no plant, ever appears\r\nthere in a sickly condition, but this may be said also of the animals in\r\nthe gardens. I shall not soon forget a great wire canary cage some\r\nsixteen or more feet square, enclosing considerable shrubbery and scores\r\nof birds. There I received my first notion of the natural brilliancy of\r\nthe plumage of these birds: its golden sheen literally dazzled the eyes.\r\n\r\nThe garden does excellent work for the French people besides furnishing\r\na popular school and an inimitable pleasure resort: it assures the\r\npreservation of approved varieties of fruits, grains, animals. Whoever\r\nquestions the absolute purity of his stock, from a garden herb up to an\r\nArabian steed, can place this beyond question by substituting those\r\nfurnished by the Society of Acclimatation. Eggs of birds packed in its\r\ngarden have safely crossed the Atlantic, seventy-five per cent. hatching\r\non their arrival. So immensely has the business of the society increased\r\nthat more ground has had to be secured for nursery and seed-raising\r\npurposes, and the whole vast Zoological Gardens of Marseilles have been\r\nsecured and turned into a \"tender,\" as it were, to the Jardin\r\nd'Acclimatation at Paris. This was a very important acquisition.\r\nMarseilles, the great Mediterranean sea-port of France, is necessarily\r\nthe spot where treasures from Africa, Asia and the South Sea Islands\r\nhave to be landed, and they arrive often in a critical condition and\r\nneed rest and careful nursing before continuing their journey.\r\n\r\nOne of the functions of the garden is to restock parks with game when\r\nthe pheasants, hares, wild-boars, deer, etc. become too rare for good\r\nsport: another is to tame and break to the harness certain animals\r\ncounted unmanageable. The zebra is one of these. The society has\r\nsucceeded perfectly in breaking the zebra and making him work in the\r\nfield quite like the horse. An ostrich also allows itself to be\r\nharnessed to a small carriage and to draw two children in it over the\r\ngarden. Still another work of the society is to breed new species. A\r\nvery beautiful animal has been bred by crossing the wild-ass of Mongolia\r\nwith the French variety.\r\n\r\nAmong the rare animals of the garden may be mentioned the apteryx,\r\nthe only bird existing belonging to the same family as the\r\n_Dinornis giganteus_ and the still larger _Epyornis maximus_ of\r\nMadagascar--monstrous wingless birds now extinct. One of the eggs of the\r\nlatter in a fossil condition is preserved in the museum of the Garden of\r\nPlants in Paris. Its longer axis is sixteen inches, I think. It is, for\r\nan egg, a most wonderful thing, and on account of its size the bird\r\nlaying it has been supposed to be of very much greater size than even\r\nthe _Dinornis giganteus_, a perfect skeleton of which exists; but this\r\nseems to be a too hasty conclusion, for the apteryx, a member of the\r\nsame family, has laid an egg or two in captivity, and one of these on\r\nbeing weighed proved to be very nearly one-fourth the whole weight of\r\nthe bird, the bird weighing sixty ounces and the egg fourteen and a\r\nhalf.\r\n\r\nThe _Tallegalla Lathami_, or brush-turkey of Australia, is another rare\r\nbird. It does not sit upon its eggs, but constructs a sort of hot-bed\r\nfor them, which it watches during the whole term as assiduously as a\r\nwise florist does his seeds planted under glass or as a baker does his\r\novens. As in the ostrich family, it is the male that has the entire care\r\nof the family from the moment the eggs are laid--a fairer division of\r\nlabor than we see in most _ménages_. The interesting process of\r\nconstructing the hot-bed has been observed several times in Europe. It\r\nis as follows: When the time arrives for the making of the nest the\r\nenclosure is supplied with sticks, leaves and detritus of various kinds.\r\nThe male then, with his tail to the centre of the enclosure, commences\r\nwith his powerful feet to throw up a mound of the materials furnished.\r\nTo do this he walks around in a series of concentric circles. When the\r\nmound is about four feet high the female adds a few artistic touches by\r\nway of smoothing down, evening the surface and making a depression in\r\nthe centre, where the eggs in due time are laid in a circle, each with\r\nthe point downward and no two in contact. The male tends this hot-bed\r\nmost unweariedly. \"A cylindrical opening is always maintained in the\r\ncentre of the circle\"--no doubt for ventilation--and the male will often\r\ncover and uncover the eggs two or three times a day, according to the\r\nchange of temperature. The observer, noting how intelligently this bird\r\nwatches the temperature, almost expects to see him thrust a thermometer\r\ninto his mound! On the second day after it is hatched the young bird\r\nleaves the nest, but returns to it in the afternoon, and is very cozily\r\ntucked up by his devoted papa.\r\n\r\nOne thing in the garden that used to greatly attract visitors was the\r\nGaveuse Martin, a machine for cramming fowls in order to fatten them\r\nrapidly. The society considered Martin's invention of so much importance\r\nto the world that it granted him a building in the garden and permission\r\nto charge a special admission. The machine has since been introduced\r\ninto the artificial egg-hatching establishment of Mr. Baker at\r\nCatskill-on-the-Hudson; at least, he has a machine for \"forced feeding\"\r\nwhich must greatly resemble Martin's. Specimens fattened by the Gaveuse\r\nMartin, all ready for the _broche_, used to be sold on the premises. The\r\ninterior of the building was occupied by six gigantic _épinettes_, each\r\nholding two hundred birds. A windlass mounted upon a railroad enabled\r\nthe operator (_gaveur_, from _gaver_, to cram, an inelegant term) very\r\neasily to raise himself to any story of the épinette. The latter was a\r\ncylinder turning upon its axis, and thus passing every bird in review.\r\n\"An india-rubber tube introduced into the throat, accompanied by the\r\npressure of the foot upon a pedal, makes the bird absorb its copious and\r\nsucculent repast in the wink of an eye.\" Four hundred an hour have been\r\nthus fed by one operator. Fowls thus fattened are said to possess a\r\ndelicacy of flavor entirely their own.\r\n\r\nM. H.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERATURE OF THE DAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Christy Carew. By May Laffan, author of \"The Honorable Miss\r\n     Ferrard,\" etc. (Leisure-Hour Series.) New York: Henry Holt &\r\n     Co.\r\n\r\nThe novels to which Miss Laffan gives a sponsor in affixing her\r\nsignature to the latest, _Christy Carew_, present two strong and\r\ndistinct claims to our notice in the vigor and realism with which they\r\nare written, and the thorough picture they give of Ireland, politically\r\nand socially, at the present day. They are no mere repetitions of\r\nhackneyed Irish stories, no sketches drawn from a narrow or partial\r\nphase of life, but the result of large and penetrating observation among\r\nall classes, made in a thoroughly systematized manner, so as to form a\r\nthoughtful and almost exhaustive study of a country which is more\r\ndogmatized over than understood. Ireland has never been depicted with so\r\nmuch interest and sympathy by any novelist since Miss Edgeworth wrote\r\nher _Moral Tales_, and both the country and the art of novel-writing\r\nhave advanced since then, the latter possibly more than the former. Miss\r\nEdgeworth, indeed, has been singularly unfortunate. She drew from life,\r\nand her talent and observation were worthy of a more lasting shrine,\r\nwhile the artificiality of her books has caused them to decay even\r\nfaster than those of some of her contemporaries. Her successors in Irish\r\nfiction, with no lack of talent, have been too often careless in using\r\nit, or have preferred story-telling to observation. Miss Laffan wields a\r\ngenuine Irish pen, graphic, keen of satire, with plenty of sharp\r\nHibernian humor, but she shows in its exercise a care and directness of\r\naim which are not the common qualities of Irish writers. In beginning\r\nher career as a novelist she had the courage to refrain from the pursuit\r\nof those finer artistic beauties which lure to failure so many writers\r\nincapable of seizing them: she even put aside the question of plot, and\r\nstrove to give a sound and truthful representation of life and manners.\r\n\r\nThat end was gained with masterly success. No one reading the anonymous\r\nnovel _Hogan, M.P._, would have been likely to set it down from internal\r\nevidence as a woman's book: it is one of the stoutest and most vigorous\r\npieces of fiction which have appeared for years. We can find no trace of\r\nits having been reprinted in this country, and are at a loss to account\r\nfor the omission: its distinctively Irish character ought to form an\r\nattraction. _Hogan, M.P._, is a political novel as realistic as Anthony\r\nTrollope's, but more incisive in tone and wider in scope. Instead of\r\nconfining her energies to the doings and conversations of one set of\r\npeople, Miss Laffan looks at politics as they are mirrored in society,\r\nsketching not alone the wire-pulling and petty diplomacies, but phases\r\nof life resulting therefrom. In _Hogan, M.P._, we have a vivid _coup\r\nd'oeil_ of Dublin society, with its sharp, irregular boundaries, its\r\nsects and sets, its manner of comporting and amusing itself. The field\r\nis a wide one, but Miss Laffan has the happy art of generalization--of\r\nportraying a whole society in a few well-marked types. There is no\r\nconfusion of character, and though we seem to have shaken hands with all\r\nDublin in her pages, from great dignitaries to school-boys, the picture\r\nis never overcrowded.\r\n\r\n\"A drop of ditch-water under a microscope\" Hogan calls the society of\r\nhis native city--\"everybody pushing upward on the social ladder kicking\r\ndown those behind.\" This zoological spectacle is not confined to Dublin,\r\nbut there appears to be a combination of strictness and indefiniteness\r\nof precedence belonging peculiarly to that place. At the top of the\r\nladder, though not so firmly fixed there as before the Disestablishment,\r\nis the Protestant set, regarding the Castle as its stronghold and\r\nlooking down on the Roman Catholic set, who reciprocate the contempt.\r\nThese grand divisions are separated by a strict line of demarcation,\r\neven the performance of the marriage ceremony between Protestants and\r\nCatholics being forbidden in Dublin. They contain an endless\r\nramification of lesser groups, whose relations we may attempt to\r\nillustrate by quoting from the book before us an account of the mutual\r\nposition of Mrs. O'Neil and Mrs. Carew, the former the wife of a\r\ntradesman shortly to become lord mayor, the latter a \"'vert\" from\r\nProtestantism and the spouse of a Crown solicitor in debt to his future\r\nmayorship. \"The lady mayoress elect, conscious of her prospective\r\ndignity in addition to the heavy bill due by the Carews, was the least\r\npossible shade--not patronizing, for that would have been\r\nimpossible--but perhaps independent in manner. She did not turn her head\r\ntoward her companion as she addressed her; she put more questions to her\r\nand in a broader accent than she usually did in conversation; and she\r\nbarely gave her interlocutor time to finish the rather curt\r\ncontributions she vouchsafed toward the conversation. On her side, Mrs.\r\nCarew, mindful of her position and of her superior accent, which implied\r\neven more, wanting to be condescending and patronizing, and half afraid\r\nto be openly impertinent, was calm and self-possessed. She grew more\r\nfreezingly courteous as the other lady grew less formal.\"\r\n\r\nWe have said that Miss Laffan began with realism pure and simple.\r\n_Hogan, M.P._, remains, so far, to our mind, her strongest book, but\r\nthere are finer and sweeter qualities in her other writings. We should\r\nbe inclined to rank _The Honorable Miss Ferrard_ as an artistic rather\r\nthan a realistic book, though it is based on the same soundness of\r\nobservation as its predecessor. It is an episode, suggestive, rather\r\nanalytic in treatment, with the freshness of a first impression--_le\r\ncharme de l'inachevé_. The heroine is a singularly original, fresh and\r\nattractive conception. The book deals almost wholly with the outside\r\naspects of things, with picturesque rather than moral traits, though a\r\nbreath of feeling true and sweet is wafted across it and heightens its\r\nfine vague beauty.\r\n\r\nA deeper humanity is shown in the short story _Flitters, Tatters and the\r\nCounsellor_, which made its first appearance in this magazine in\r\nJanuary, 1879. This sketch gained a quicker popularity than her longer\r\nnovels, and drew forth warm eulogies from critics so far apart in\r\nstandard as Ruskin, Leslie Stephen and Bret Harte.\r\n\r\n_Christy Carew_, in its picture of two middle-class Catholic families in\r\nDublin, takes us back to the society described in _Hogan, M.P._, but its\r\nrange is narrower and its theme rather social than political. It is a\r\nsofter and more attractive book than _Hogan, M.P._, though, like that\r\nnovel, it is devoted to a realistic picture of life. Miss Laffan's\r\ncharacters have the merit of being always real. They are often types,\r\nbut they are never mere abstractions. Whatever their importance or\r\nqualities, they stand firmly on their feet, are individual and alive.\r\nHer men are drawn with a vigor which ought to ensure them from the\r\nreproach of being ladies' men. They may display traits of weakness, but\r\nthese are due to no faltering on the author's part. In _Christy Carew_\r\nthe men are in a minority as far as minuteness of portraiture goes, and\r\nthe most elaborate touches are bestowed on the two young girls who act\r\nas heroines, for the one is as prominent as the other. Christy and her\r\nfriend Esther O'Neil present two types of girlhood. Esther, _dévote_ and\r\ngentle, is a very tender, lovable figure, but there is perhaps more\r\nskill shown in the more contradictory character of Christy, a pretty\r\ngirl addicted to flirting, keenly intelligent and impatient of the\r\nrestraints and inconsistencies of her religious teaching, yet with an\r\nearnestness which makes her feel the emptiness of her life and vaguely\r\nseek for something higher. When each of the friends is sought by a\r\nProtestant lover their different ways of regarding the calamity are in\r\nkeeping with their characters, and though any reader will agree with\r\nChristy that Esther was the more deserving of happiness, no one will be\r\nsorry that her own love-story should find a pleasant dénouement. As an\r\nargument in favor of mixed marriages the book would have been stronger\r\nif Esther's lover had been separated from her only by prejudice, and not\r\nby unworthiness as well, but the pathos of the story is in no way marred\r\nby the neglect to clinch an argument. Like all Miss Laffan's novels, it\r\nis simple in plot. Construction is not her strong point, and though\r\n_Christy Carew_ has more story to it than her former books, it is by no\r\nmeans technically perfect. There is a certain hurry about it: its good\r\nthings are not driven home, and effects upon which more skilful artists\r\nwould dwell at length are dropped in a concentration upon other objects.\r\nThe book, in the American edition, is also marred by numerous\r\ntypographical defects that betray a singular laxity in proof-reading.\r\n\r\n_Hogan, M.P._, was published in 1876: Miss Laffan's career as a novelist\r\nis therefore only four years old. We will not attempt to cast its\r\nfuture: we have simply endeavored, as far as space would admit, to point\r\nout the soundness of its foundation and the method by which it has been\r\nlaid. In all that she has written there is a reserved strength, a\r\nsincerity and conscientiousness, which mark her work as unmistakably\r\ngenuine. A large store of observation lies behind all her writing, and\r\nan intellectual power of a very high order is apparent throughout. What\r\nshe lacks is a mellowness and breadth of art which would enable her to\r\nblend and concentrate her qualities--to bring the realism of _Hogan,\r\nM.P._, into unison with the grace of _The Honorable Miss Ferrard_ and\r\nthe pathos and sympathy of _Christy Carew_--to give form and\r\ncompleteness to her work. Then Ireland would have a great novelist.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The Reminiscences of an Idler. By Henry Wikoff. New York:\r\n     Fords, Howard & Hulbert.\r\n\r\nThe reminiscences of idle men are apt to be more entertaining than those\r\nof busy men. The idler, passing his time in search of amusement, can\r\nhardly fail to communicate it when he yields up his store of\r\nexperiences. Being disengaged, his mind is more observant and more\r\nretentive of the by-play of life, which is the only amusing part of it,\r\nthan that of one of the chief actors can possibly be. Moreover, idlers\r\nare the natural confidants of the busy: they are consulted, made useful\r\nas go-betweens, entrusted with those little services which, being\r\ntransient and disconnected, are precisely suited to their disposition\r\nand secure them a place in the economy of Nature. Mr. Wikoff has been a\r\nmodel idler, with large opportunities of this description. From boyhood\r\nhe has, according to his own account, shirked all regular application\r\nand devoted himself to the pursuit of pleasure, including the\r\ngratification of an intelligent but superficial curiosity in regard to\r\nmen and manners. He has come in close contact with a great variety of\r\npeople, especially of a class whose private lives and public careers\r\nreact in the production of a piquant interest. These associations kept\r\nhis hands full of what only a very rigid censor would denominate\r\nmischief. His intimacy with Forrest gained him a suitable companion in a\r\njourney to the Crimea, and the tragedian a not less suitable negotiator\r\nin the arrangements for his marriage and his professional engagements in\r\nLondon. He aided Lady Bulwer in her fight with her husband's family and\r\nthe recovery of her stolen lap-dog. His friendly offices to Fanny\r\nEllsler were more important and fruitful. He had the chief share in\r\nbringing her to America, smoothing away the difficulties, assuming the\r\nresponsibilities, and escorting her in person, while taking charge at\r\nthe same time of two other interesting and otherwise unprotected\r\nfemales. It was, indeed, we need hardly say, in feminine affairs that\r\nMr. Wikoff was most at home. But his obliging disposition made him\r\nequally ready to execute commissions for members of the Bonaparte\r\nfamily, his relations with whom grew closer and more interesting at a\r\nperiod subsequent to that which is embraced in this volume. Many other\r\nnotabilities, both American and European, have more or less prominence\r\nin its pages. Some letters from Mrs. Grote are especially deserving of\r\nnotice. As long as it is confined to personal topics the narrative is\r\nnever dull. Without being distinguished for vigor or wit, it has the\r\ngraceful and sprightly garrulity characteristic of the well-preserved\r\nveteran. Unfortunately, it betrays also the tendency to tediousness\r\nwhich belongs to a revered epoch, much of it, being devoted to persons\r\nand things seen only from a distance and without the powers of vision\r\nrequisite for penetrating their true character. But, in spite of this\r\ndefect, the book is exceedingly readable and enjoyable, and we trust to\r\nhave a continuation of it which may show a restraining influence\r\nexercised with kindness and tact, such as were so often exerted by the\r\nauthor for the benefit of his friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The Life and Work of William Augustus Muhlenberg. By Anne\r\n     Ayres. New York: Harper & Brothers.\r\n\r\nThere could not well be a stronger contrast than between the subject of\r\nthis book and that of the one just noticed. We have called Mr. Wikoff a\r\nmodel idler, and with at least equal truth we may call Dr. Muhlenberg a\r\nmodel worker, not because he was unremitting and methodical in labor or\r\nbecause his work was his delight, but because it was consecrated by a\r\ndevoted singleness of purpose and crowned by the noblest achievements.\r\nThe life of the founder of St. Luke's Hospital and St. Johnland, as\r\nexhibited in this faithful record, has the simplicity and grandeur of an\r\nantique statue, and in the contemplation of it the marvel of its rare\r\nperfection grows, till we are half inclined to ask whether it, too, be\r\nnot some relic of the remote past rather than a product of our own age.\r\nSaintly purity, unbounded beneficence, intense earnestness and\r\ngreat-hearted liberality of sentiment were never more symmetrically\r\nblended than in the character of \"the great presbyter,\" whose\r\nministrations were neither inspired nor confined by any narrower dogma\r\nthan \"that love to man, flowing from love to God,\" which, as he himself,\r\nwith no lack of humility, said, \"had been their impulse.\" It has been\r\njustly observed that \"he was eminently the common property of a common\r\nChristianity,\" and not less truly that \"there is, and ever will be, more\r\nof Christian charity in the world because Dr. Muhlenberg has lived in it\r\nas he did.\" He was perhaps not a man of extraordinary intellect, but his\r\nsingularly healthy mind, with its union of resoluteness and candor,\r\nsound sense and lively fancy, gave the needed counterpoise to his moral\r\nqualities, keeping his enterprises within the domain of the useful and\r\nthe practical, and thus saving him from the disappointments that too\r\noften checker the career of the philanthropist. This biography, written\r\nfrom long and intimate knowledge and admirable alike in spirit and\r\nexecution, will find, we may trust, a multitude of readers among members\r\nof all sects and those who belong to none. Its interest is of a far more\r\nabsorbing kind than any that can be excited by gossip or anecdote. It is\r\nthat of a vivid portraiture, in which nothing characteristic is missing,\r\nin which the details are all harmonious, and which awakens not only our\r\nadmiration, but our warmest sympathies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Books Received._\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory of Political Economy in Europe.
