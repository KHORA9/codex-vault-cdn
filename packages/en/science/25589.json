And why do you shoot\r\n      poor Moo Cows?--PUBLISHER.\r\n\r\n      Mere slip of the pen. Meant a Cow Moose. Literary gent no\r\n      sportsman.--ED.\r\n\r\n      All right.--PUBLISHER.\r\n\r\nThe hall-porter presently entered, bearing a huge parcel, which had\r\njust arrived by post. I opened it with all the excitement that an\r\nunexpected parcel can cause, and murmured, like Thackeray's sailor-man,\r\n'Claret, perhaps, Mumm, I hope----'\r\n\r\nIt was a Mummy Case, by Jingo!\r\n\r\nThis was no common, or museum mummy case. The lid, with the gilded\r\nmask, was absent, and the under half or lower segment, painted all over\r\nwith hieroglyphics of an unusual type, and _green_ in colour--had\r\nobviously been used as a cradle for unconscious infancy. A baby had\r\nslept in the last sleeping-place of the dead! What an opportunity for\r\nthe moralist! But I am not a collector of cradles.\r\n\r\nWho had sent it, and why?\r\n\r\nThe question was settled by an envelope in a feminine hand, which, with\r\na cylindrical packet, fell out of the Mummy Case, and contained a\r\nletter running as follows:--\r\n\r\n    _'Lady Betty's, Oxford._\r\n\r\n    _'My dear Sir,--You have not forgotten me and my friend Leonora\r\n    O'Dolite?_\r\n\r\n    _'The Mummy Case which encloses this document is the Cradle of\r\n    her ancient Race._\r\n\r\n    _'We are, for reasons you will discover in the accompanying\r\n    manuscript, about to start for Treasure Island, where, if anywhere\r\n    in this earth, ready money is to be found on easy terms of personal\r\n    insecurity.'_\r\n\r\n'Oh, confound it,' I cried, 'here's another fiend of a woman sending me\r\nanother manuscript! They are always at it! Wants to get it into a\r\nhigh-class magazine, as usual.' And my guess was correct.\r\n\r\nThe letter went on:--\r\n\r\n    '_You, who are so well known, will have no difficulty in getting\r\n    the editor of the Nineteenth Century, or the Quarterly Review, or\r\n    Bow Bells, to accept my little contribution. I shall be glad to hear\r\n    what remuneration I am to expect, and cheques may be forwarded\r\n    to_\r\n\r\n    '_Yours very truly,_\r\n\r\n    'MARY MARTIN.\r\n\r\n    'P.S.--_The mummy case is very valuable. Please deposit it at the\r\n    Old Bank, in the High, where it will represent my balance._\r\n\r\n    'M. M.'\r\n\r\nNow I get letters like this (not usually escorted by a mummy case)\r\nabout thrice a day, and a pretty sum it costs me in stamps to send back\r\nthe rubbish to the amateur authors. But how could I send back a\r\nmanuscript to a lady already on her way to Treasure Island?\r\n\r\nHere, perhaps, I should explain how Mary Martin, as she signed herself,\r\ncame to choose _me_ for her literary agent. To be sure, total strangers\r\nare always sending me their manuscripts, but Mrs. Martin had actually\r\nbeen introduced to me years before.\r\n\r\nI was staying, as it happened, at one of our university towns, which I\r\nshall call Oxford, for short--not that that was _really_ its name.\r\nWalking one day with a niece, a scholar of Lady Betty's Hall, we\r\nchanced to meet in the High two rather remarkable persons. One of them\r\nwas the very prettiest girl I ever saw in my life. Her noble frame\r\nmarked her as the victor over Girton at lawn-tennis; while her\r\n_pince-nez_ indicated the student. She reminded me, in the grace of her\r\nmovements, of the Artemis of the Louvre and the Psyche of Naples, while\r\nher thoughtful expression recalled the celebrated 'Reading Girl' of\r\nDonatello. Only a reading girl, indeed, could have been, as she was,\r\nReader in English Literature on the Churton Collins Foundation.\r\n\r\n'Who is she?' I said to my friend, the scholar of Lady Betty's; 'what a\r\nlovely creature she is!'\r\n\r\n'Who, _that_?' she replied with some tartness. 'Well, what you can see\r\nin _her_, _I_ don't know. That's Leonora O'Dolite, and the lady with\r\nher is the Lady Superior of Lady Betty's.\r\n\r\n'They call them Pretty and the Proctor,' my friend went on, 'as Mrs.\r\nMartin--Polly they call her too--has been Proctor twice.'[2]\r\n\r\n      [2]\r\n      I say, you know, keep clear of improbabilities! No one was\r\n      ever old enough to have been Proctor _twice_.--PUBLISHER.\r\n\r\n      That's all you know about it. Why, I shall bring in a\r\n      character old enough to have been Proctor a thousand\r\n      times.--ED.\r\n\r\nNow nobody could have called Polly bewitching. Her age must really have\r\nbeen quite thirty-five. I dislike dwelling on this topic, but she was\r\nshort, dumpy, wore blue spectacles, a green umbrella, a red and black\r\nshawl, worsted mittens and uncompromising boots. She had also the\r\nringlets and other attractions with which French Art adorns its ideal\r\nEnglishwoman.\r\n\r\nAt my request, I was introduced; but presently some thirty professors,\r\nsix or seven senior dons, and a sprinkling of Heads of Houses in red\r\nand black sleeves came bounding out of University sermon, and gathered\r\nround the lovely Leonora. The master of St. Catherine's was accompanied\r\nby a hitherto Unattached student, who manifestly at once fell a victim\r\nto Leonora's charms.\r\n\r\nThis youth was of peculiar aspect. He was a member of the nearly\r\nextinct Boshman tribe of Kokoatinaland. His long silky hair, originally\r\nblack, had been blanched to a permanent and snowy white by failures in\r\nthe attempt to matriculate at Balliol. He was short--not above four\r\nfeet nine--and was tattooed all over his dark but intelligent features.\r\n\r\nWhen he was introduced I had my first opportunity of admiring Leonora's\r\nextraordinary knowledge of native customs and etiquette.\r\n\r\n'Let me present to you,' said the Master of St. Catherine's, 'the\r\nBoshman chief, Ustani!'\r\n\r\n'You 'stonish me!' answered Leonora, with a smile that captivated the\r\nBoshman. It is a rule among the tribes of Kokoatinaland, and in Africa\r\ngenerally, to greet a new acquaintance with a verbal play on his\r\nname.[3] Owing to our insular ignorance, and the difficulty of the\r\ntask, this courtesy had been omitted at Oxford in Ustani's case, even\r\nby the Professors of Comparative Philology and the learned Keeper of\r\nthe Museum. From that hour to another which struck later, when _he_\r\nstruck too, Ustani was Leonora's slave.\r\n\r\n      [3]\r\n      Is this _bona fide_?--PUBLISHER.\r\n\r\n      All right, see _She_ (p. 145), Ayesha's elegant pun on Holly.\r\n      It's always done--pun, I mean.--ED.\r\n\r\nI had no further opportunity of conversing with Leonora and Polly, nor\r\nindeed did I ever think of them again, till Polly's letter and mummy\r\ncase recalled them to my memory.\r\n\r\nPerhaps for pretty Leonora's sake I did, after all, take up and open\r\nthe vast cylindrical roll of MS.[4] in the mummy case. Dawn found me\r\nstill reading the following record of unparalleled adventure.[5]\r\n\r\n      [4]\r\n      Don't you think it would stand being cut a little?--PUBLISHER.\r\n\r\n      We shall see.--ED.\r\n\r\n      [5]\r\n      There is just one thing that puzzles me. Polly and Leonora\r\n      have gone, no man knows where, and, taking everything into\r\n      consideration, it may be a good two thousand years before they\r\n      come back.\r\n\r\n      Ought I not, then, to invest, _in my own name_, the\r\n      princely cheque of the Intelligent Publishers?--ED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nPOLLY'S NARRATIVE.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am the plainest woman in England, bar none.[6] Even in youth I was\r\nnot, strictly speaking, voluptuously lovely. Short, stumpy, with a\r\nfringe like the thatch of a newly evicted cottage, such was my\r\nappearance at twenty, and such it remains. Like Cain, I was branded.[7]\r\nBut enough of personalities. I had in youth but one friend, a lady of\r\nkingly descent (the kings, to be sure, were Irish), and of bewitching\r\nloveliness. When she rushed into my lonely rooms, one wild winter\r\nnight, with a cradle in her arms and a baby in the cradle; when she\r\nbesought me to teach that infant Hittite, Hebrew, and the Differential\r\nCalculus, and to bring it up in college, on commons (where the air is\r\nsalubrious), what could I do but acquiesce? It is unusual, I know, for\r\na student of my sex, however learned, to educate an infant in college\r\nand bring her up on commons. But for once the uncompromising nature of\r\nmy charms strangled the breath of scandal in the bud, and little\r\nLeonora O'Dolite became the darling of the university. The old Keeper\r\nof the Bodleian was a crusty bachelor, who liked nothing young but\r\ncalf, and preferred morocco to _that_. But even _he_ loved Leonora. One\r\nnight the little girl was lost, and only after looking for her in the\r\nHebdomadal Boardroom, in the Sheldonian, the Pusaeum, and all the\r\nbarges, did we find that unprincipled old man amusing her by letting\r\noff crackers and Roman-candles among the Mexican MSS. in the Bodleian!\r\n\r\n      [6]\r\n      I may as well say at once that I _will not_ be responsible for\r\n      Polly's style. Sometimes it is flat, they tell me, and\r\n      sometimes it is flamboyant, whatever they may mean. It is\r\n      never the least like what one would expect an elderly lady don\r\n      (or Donna), to write.--ED.\r\n\r\n      [7]\r\n      See _The Mark of Cain_ [Arrowsmith], an excellent\r\n      shillingsworth.--ED.\r\n\r\n      Is this not 'log rolling'?--PUBLISHER.\r\n\r\nThese were halcyon hours, happier as Leonora grew up and received the\r\neducation prescribed for her by her parent. Her Hebrew was fair, and\r\nher Hittite up to a first class, but, to my distress, she mainly\r\ndevoted herself to Celtic studies.\r\n\r\nI should tell you that Leonora's chief interest in life was the\r\ndecipherment of the inscriptions on her cradle--the mummy case which\r\nhad rocked her ancestors since Abraham's time, and which is now in your\r\npossession. Of itself it is a sufficient proof of the accuracy of this\r\nnarrative. The mummy case is not the ordinary coffin of Egyptian\r\ncommerce. The hieroglyphics have baffled Dr. Isaac Taylor, and have\r\nbeen variously construed as Chinese, Etruscan, and Basque, by the\r\nvarious professors of these learned lingoes.[8]\r\n\r\n      [8]\r\n      Don't you think this bit is a little dull? The public don't\r\n      care about dead languages.--PUBLISHER.\r\n\r\n      Story can't possibly get on without it, as you'll see. You\r\n      _must_ have something of this sort in a romance. Look at Poe's\r\n      cypher in the _Gold Beetle_, and the chart in _Treasure\r\n      Island_, and the Portuguee's scroll in _King Solomon's\r\n      Mines_.--ED.\r\n\r\nNow about this mummy case: you must know that it had been in Leonora's\r\nfamily ever since her ancestress, Theodolite, Pharaoh's daughter, left\r\nEgypt, not knowing when she was well off, and settled in Ireland, of\r\nall places, where she founded the national prosperity.[9]\r\n\r\n      [9]\r\n      Is not _this_ a little steep?--PUBLISHER.\r\n\r\n      No; it is in all the Irish histories. See Lady Wilde's\r\n      _Ancient Legends of Ireland_, if you don't believe me.--ED.\r\n\r\nThe mummy case and a queer ring (see cover) inscribed with a duck, a\r\nduck's egg, and an umbrella, were about all that the O'Dolites kept of\r\ntheir ancient property. The older Leonora grew the more deeply she\r\nstudied the inscriptions on the mummy case. She tried it as Zend, she\r\ntried it as Sanskrit, and Japanese, and the American language, and\r\nfinally she tried it as Irish.\r\n\r\nWe had a very rainy season that winter even for Oxford, and the more it\r\nrained the more Leonora pored over that mummy case. I kept telling her\r\nthere was nothing in it, but she would not listen to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nLEONORA'S DISCOVERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne wild winter night, when the sleet lashed the pane, my door suddenly\r\nopened. I started out of a slumber, and--could I believe my eyes? can\r\nhistory repeat itself?--there stood the friend of my early youth, her\r\neyes ablaze, a cradle in her arms. Was it all coming round again? A\r\nmoment's reflection showed me that it was _not_ my early friend, but\r\nher daughter, Leonora.\r\n\r\n'Leonora,' I screamed, 'don't tell me that _you_----'\r\n\r\n'I have deciphered the inscription,' said the girl proudly, setting\r\ndown the cradle. The baby had _not_ come round.\r\n\r\n'Oh, is _that_ all?' I replied. 'Let's have a squint at it' (in my case\r\nno mere figure of speech).\r\n\r\n'What do you call _that_?' said Leonora, handing me the accompanying\r\ndocument.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n'I call it pie,' said I, using a technical term of typography. 'I can't\r\nmake head or tail of it,' I said peevishly.\r\n\r\n'Well, pie or no pie, I love it like pie, and I've broken the crust,'\r\nanswered the girl, 'according to my interpretation, which I cannot\r\nmistrust.'\r\n\r\n'Why?' I asked.\r\n\r\n'Because,' she answered; and the response seemed sufficient when mixed\r\nwith her bright smile.\r\n\r\n'It runs thus,' she resumed with severity, 'in the only language _you_\r\ncan partially understand----\r\n\r\n'It runs thus,' she reiterated, and I could not help saying under such\r\nbreath as I had left, 'Been running a long time now.'\r\n\r\nShe frowned and read--\r\n\r\n    '_I, Theodolite, daughter of a race that has never been run out,\r\n    did to the magician Jambres, whose skill was even as the skill of\r\n    the gods, those things which as you have not yet heard I shall now\r\n    proceed to relate to you.\r\n\r\n    'Of him, I say, was I jealous, for that he loved a maiden\r\n    inferior--Oh how inferior!--to me in charms, wit, beauty,\r\n    intellect, stature, girth, and ancestry. Therefore, being well\r\n    assured of this, I made the man into a mummy, ere ever his living\r\n    spirit had left him. What arts I used to this last purpose it boots\r\n    not, nor do I choose to tell. When I had done this thing I put him\r\n    secretly away in a fitting box, even as Set concealed Osiris. Then\r\n    came my maidens and tidied him away, as is the wont of these\r\n    accursed ones. From that hour, even until now, has no man nor woman\r\n    known where to find him, even Jambres the magician. For though the\r\n    mummifying, as thou shalt not fail to discover, was in some sort\r\n    incomplete, yet the tidying away and the losing were so complete\r\n    that no putting forth of precious papyri into cupboards beneath\r\n    flights of stairs has ever equalled it.\r\n\r\n    'Now, therefore, shall I curse these maidens, even in Amenti, the\r\n    place of their tormenting.\r\n\r\n    'Forget them, may they be eternally forgotten.\r\n\r\n    'Curse them up and down through the whole solar system.'_\r\n\r\n'This is very violent language, my dear,' said I.\r\n\r\n'Our people swore terribly in Egypt,' answered Leonora, calmly.\r\n\r\n    '_But it is vain, no woman can curse worth a daric._[10]\r\n\r\n          [10] From the use of the word _daric_ I conjecture that\r\n          Leonora's ancestress lived under the Persian Empire. There\r\n          or thereabout.--M. M.\r\n\r\n    '_But for this, the losing of the one whom I mummied, must I\r\n    suffer countless penalties. For I, even the seeress, know not what\r\n    the said maidens did with the said mummy, nor do you know, nor any\r\n    other. And not to know, for I want my mummy to have a good cry\r\n    over, is great part of my punishment. But this I, the seeress, do\r\n    know right well, for it was revealed to me in a dream. And this I\r\n    do prophesy unto thee, my daughter, or daughter's daughter, ay,\r\n    this do I say, that a curse will rest upon me until He who was\r\n    mummied shall be found.\r\n\r\n    'Now this also do I, the seeress, tell thee. He who was mummified\r\n    shall be found in the dark country, where there is no sun, and men\r\n    breathe the vapour of smoke, and light lamps at noonday, and wire\r\n    themselves even with wires when the wind bloweth. And the place\r\n    where the mummy dwelleth is beneath the Three Balls of Gold. And\r\n    one will lead thee thither who abides hard by the great tree carven\r\n    like the head of an Ethiopian. And thou shalt come to the people\r\n    who slate strangers, and to the place of the Rolling of Logs, and\r\n    the music thereof.\r\n\r\n    'Thereafter shalt thou find Him, even Jambres. And when thou hast\r\n    healed him the Curse shall fall from me!\r\n\r\n    'Nor, indeed, shall the unmummying be accomplished, even then,\r\n    unless thou, O my daughter, or my daughter's daughter as before,\r\n    shalt go with He-who-was-mummied to the Hall of Egyptian Darkness\r\n    and sit in the Wizard's Chair that is thereby, even the seat which\r\n    was erst the Siege Perilous. These things have I said, well knowing\r\n    that they shall be accomplished._\r\n\r\n    '_To thee, my daughter!_\r\n\r\n    'THY GRANDMOTHER.'\r\n\r\n'There, Polly, what do you say to _that_?' said Nora.\r\n\r\n'Your grandmother!' I replied.\r\n\r\n'Polly!' said Miss Nora, looking at me with quite needlessly flashing\r\neyes, 'you and I will set out on the search for this unhappy mummied\r\none.'\r\n\r\n'Don't you think the critics will call the _motive_ rather thin?' I\r\ndemurred.\r\n\r\n'Thin, to rescue my ancestress from a curse!' said Leonora.\r\n\r\n'There's just one other thing,' she mused. 'Shall we take a low comedy\r\ncharacter this time, or not?'\r\n\r\n'Let's take Ustani,' I proposed, 'he can double the part with that of\r\nthe Faithful Black! A great saving in hotel bills and railway fares.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE EQUIPMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter it had been decided that we should start in search of '_He_ who\r\nhad been mummified alive,' the next step seemed to be to go. But\r\nLeonora demurred to this.\r\n\r\n'We must have our things,' she said; 'what do you think we should\r\ntake?'\r\n\r\n'Scissors,' I replied; and I regret to say that at first she\r\nmisinterpreted the phrase.\r\n\r\nLeonora is a powerful as well as a pretty girl, and when the bear fight\r\nthat ensued was over my rooms were a little mixed.\r\n\r\nThis suggested mixed biscuits, that invaluable refreshment of the\r\ntraveller, and from one thing to another we soon made up a complete\r\nlist of our needs.\r\n\r\nThe scissors, and skates, and the soap we procured at the Church and\r\nState stores,[11] but not, of course, the revolvers. The revolvers we\r\ngot of the genuine Government pattern, because both Leonora and I are\r\ndreadfully afraid of fire-arms, and we knew that _these_, anyhow, would\r\nnot 'go off.' The jam we got, of course, at the official cartridge\r\nemporium, same which we did _not_ shoot the Arabs. The Gladstone bag\r\nand the Bryant & May's matches we procured direct from the makers,\r\nresisting the piteous appeals of itinerant vendors. Some life-belts we\r\nlaid in, and, as will presently be seen, we could have made no more\r\njudicious purchase.\r\n\r\n      [11]\r\n      Won't the critics say you are advertising the stores? And the\r\n      tradesmen won't like it.--PUBLISHER.\r\n\r\n      Where would the _stern reality_ of the story be (see _Spectator_),\r\n      and the contrast with the later goings on, if you didn't give\r\n      names?--ED.\r\n\r\nAs, from information received on a mummy case, we were travelling in\r\nsearch of a mummy, of course we laid in a case of Mumm, which was often\r\na source of gaiety in our darkest hours. The wine was procured, as I\r\nwould advise every African traveller to do, from Messrs. ----.[12]\r\n\r\n      [12]\r\n      Messrs. Who? Printers in a hurry.--PUBLISHER.\r\n\r\n      Suppressed the name. Messrs. ---- gave an impolite response to\r\n      our suggestions as to mutual arrangements.--ED.\r\n\r\nBeing acquainted with the deleterious effects of a malarious tropical\r\natmosphere, we secured a pair of overalls, advertised as sovran for\r\n'all-overishness,' the dreaded curse of an African climate. These we\r\ngot at the celebrated emporium of Messrs. ----.[13]\r\n\r\n      [13]\r\n      Name suppressed. When eligible opportunity for advertisement\r\n      as a substitute for a cheque was hinted at, Messrs. ----\r\n      brusquely replied, in the low Essex _patois_, 'Wadyermean?'\r\n\r\nOur preparations being now exhaustively completed, Leonora and I\r\nreturned to Oxford, packed our things, and consulted as to the route\r\nwhich we should adopt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nDOWN THE DARK RIVER.\r\n\r\n\r\nDown the Dark River, the mystic Isis, so Leonora had decided, we sped:\r\nUstani plying the long pole of the dhow, or native flat-bottomed boat,\r\nwhile we took it in turns to keep him up to his work by flicking him\r\nwith a tandem-whip.\r\n\r\nThe moon went slowly down, and it occurred to Leonora to remark that we\r\nwere 'going down' too, an unusual thing so early in term. Like some\r\nsweet bride into her chamber the moon departed, and the quivering\r\nfootsteps of the Don[14] shook the planets from their places, to the\r\nconsternation of the Savilian Professor of Astronomy, who, as in duty\r\nbound, was contemplating these revolutionary performances from the\r\nobservatory in the Parks. A number of moral ideas occurred to Leonora\r\nand myself, but out of regard for Ustani's feelings we denied them\r\nexpression. I began, indeed, to utter a few appropriate sentiments, but\r\nthe poor Boshman exclaimed, 'You floggee, floggee, Missy, or preachee,\r\npreachee, but no _both_ floggee and preachee--' in a tone that would\r\nhave disarmed a Bampton lecturer.\r\n\r\n      [14]\r\n      Do you mean the Dawn?--PUBLISHER.\r\n\r\n      Every Oxford man knows what I mean.--ED.\r\n\r\nDown we drifted, ever downwards, obedient to the inscrutable laws of\r\nthe equilibrium of fluids. Now we swept past the White Willow, now\r\nthrough the cruel crawling waters of the Gut, now threaded the\r\ncalamitous gorge of Iffley, and then shot the perilous cataract of\r\nSandford.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, just when the dhow was yet quivering with the strain, I\r\nnoticed an expression of abject fear on the face of Ustani. His dark\r\ncountenance was positively blanched with horror, and his teeth\r\nchattered.\r\n\r\n'Silence, chatterbox!' I cried, querulously perhaps, when he laid down\r\nhis pole and seated himself in an attitude of despair.\r\n\r\n'What's the matter, old boy?' asked Leonora, and the reply came in\r\nfaltering accents--\r\n\r\n'_The Ama Barghis!_'[15]\r\n\r\n      [15]\r\n      _Ama_ is the prefix of all the tribal names; Ama Zulu, Ama\r\n      Hagger. I connect it with the Greek preposition [Greek:\r\n      hama].--ED.\r\n\r\n      Don't keep hammer hammering away at Greek! This is a boy's\r\n      book, not a holiday task, this is!--PUBLISHER.\r\n\r\nWe glanced in terror down the river's edge.\r\n\r\nThere, on the path trodden by so many millions of feet that now are\r\nsilent,[16] there were the burly forms of five or six splendid savages.\r\n\r\n      [16]\r\n      _Please_ don't begin moralising again. One never knows when it\r\n      will come upon you.--PUBLISHER.\r\n\r\n      Couldn't help just throwing it in.--ED.\r\n\r\nThe character of their language--which was borne to us on the pure\r\nbreeze of morning--their costume, their floating house, in which these\r\nscourges of the water highway commonly reside--everything combined to\r\ndemonstrate that they belonged to the Barghiz, the most powerful and\r\nmost dreaded of the native populations.\r\n\r\n'_Me umslopogey_,' whispered Ustani in his native language, meaning\r\nthat he would retreat.\r\n\r\n'Eyes in the boat,' cried Leonora, in her clear, commanding tones;\r\n'paddle on all!'\r\n\r\nThe Boshman, cowed by her aspect, and the mere slave of discipline (he\r\nhad pulled in the St. Catherine's second torpid), obeyed her command,\r\nand presently we were abreast of the Barghiz.\r\n\r\n'Hi, Miss,' cried the Barghi chief, a man of colossal stature, 'Can't\r\nyer look where yer a shovin' to?'\r\n\r\nThough his words were unintelligible, his tone was insulting.\r\n\r\nLeonora rose to her feet, and to the occasion.\r\n\r\nBy virtue of her rare acquaintance with savage customs, she was able to\r\ntaunt the Barghiz with the horrors of their tribal mystery, to divulge\r\nwhich is _Death_!\r\n\r\nShe openly insulted the secret orgies of the tribe.\r\n\r\n_She denounced the Dog-Feast!_\r\n\r\n'WHO ATE THE PUPPY PIE UNDER MARLOWE BRIDGE?' shrilled Leonora in\r\nher proud sweet young voice.\r\n\r\nIn a moment a shower of stones struck the dhow, and spurred the water\r\ninto storm. Frank Muller, the Barghi chief, distinguished himself by\r\nthe fury of his imprecations and the accuracy of his aim. A smothered\r\ngroan told me that Ustani had been hit in the mouth.\r\n\r\n_Whid, whad, crash_ went the stones, while Leonora plied the pole\r\nwith desperate energy, and I erected the patent reversible umbrellas\r\nwith which we were provided to catch any breath of favourable wind.\r\n\r\nThe fierce rapidity of the stream finally carried us out of the reach\r\nof the infuriated Barghiz (who, moreover, were providentially slain by\r\nlightning--a common enough occurrence in that favoured climate, where\r\nnobody thinks anything of it), and we rested, weary and wounded, in a\r\nsheltered backwater.[17]\r\n\r\n      [17]\r\n      Are you not gliding insensibly into _Bess_?--PUBLISHER.\r\n\r\n      No; all right. It is a tremendous country for storms; can't\r\n      use them too often; adds to the sense of reality.--ED.\r\n\r\n'The dhow's looking rather dowdy,' said Leonora, glancing at the\r\nshattered craft.\r\n\r\n'If doughty deeds my lady please,' said I, catching her light tone,\r\n'why, she must take the consequences. But, Leonora,' I added,\r\nshuddering, 'I'm sure my feet are damp.'\r\n\r\nIf there is one thing I dread it is damp feet.\r\n\r\n'No wonder,' said Leonora, calmly. 'The dhow has sprung a leek.'\r\n\r\nI searched the dhow everywhere, but could find no trace of the\r\nvegetable.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the water had risen above the capstan, and Ustani, shivering\r\naudibly, had perched himself on the bowsprit.\r\n\r\n'Now or never,' said Leonora, 'is the moment for our life-belts.'\r\n\r\nWe hurriedly put on our life-belts, regretting the absence of an\r\nexperienced maid.\r\n\r\n'I'll be Mrs. Lecks, and you'll be Mrs. Aleshine!' laughed Leonora, as\r\nthe dhow, shuddering in all her timbers, collapsed.\r\n\r\n'_Ego et Lecks mea!_' cried I, not to seem deficient in opportune\r\ngaiety of allusion, and we were in the water. We advanced briskly down\r\nstream, Ustani propelling himself with the pole of the dhow.\r\n\r\nEver anxious about Ustani's University education (interrupted by this\r\nexpedition), Leonora kept 'coaching' him in the usual way.\r\n\r\n'Bow, you're feathering under water,' she exclaimed, when the\r\nunfortunate Ustani disappeared in a lasher, where we, thanks to our\r\nlife-belts, floated gaily enough.\r\n\r\nHere we paused to catch a few of the perch and gudgeons, which Leonora\r\nhad attracted by carefully wearing white stockings.\r\n\r\n'Nothing like white stockings for perch,' she said.\r\n\r\nAs there were not perch enough to go round, Ustani was told to content\r\nhimself with the pole, a synonym, if not an equivalent.\r\n\r\nLaying our trencher-caps on the water, we used them, as of old, for\r\ntrenchers, and made an excellent meal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE ZU.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur course was now through a series of cross streams, and finally we\r\nemerged into a long, perfectly straight, and perfectly tranquil expanse\r\nof water, bordered by a path which had every appearance of having been\r\nmade by the hand of man.\r\n\r\nNight fell: a strange, murky night, smelling of lucifer matches, and\r\nlit on the eastern horizon by a mysterious light, flaring like a dreary\r\ndawn.\r\n\r\nOur passage was obstructed by a thousand obstacles, and at one point we\r\nplunged into the very bowels of the earth for a distance of at least a\r\nquarter of a mile. Next we found the canal barred by a grinning row of\r\nblack iron teeth, under which we dived as best we might. We were now,\r\nUstani whispered to us, within the strange and dreaded region known to\r\nthe superstitious natives as _the Zu_. For the first time in our\r\nexpedition we heard the roaring of innumerable wild beasts. The\r\nrattling trumpet of the elephant, the drum of the gorilla, the scream\r\nof the lion, the chattering of countless apes, the yells of myriads of\r\ncockatoos, the growls of bears, the sobs of walri,[18] the whistle of\r\nrhinocerotes, combined to make a strange pandemonium--strange, I call\r\nit, because the zoological learning I had picked up while with Nora at\r\nOxford, informed me at once that the variety of roars, screams, grunts,\r\nskreeks, whirrings, which our footsteps seemed to awake in every kind\r\nof animal, bird, and insect, could be paralleled only in the pages of\r\nthe 'Swiss Family Robinson.' Add to this, that it was _night_, yet dark\r\nas a day on the London flags when the fog creeps silently about your\r\nfeet and, rising from utter blackness, grows white and whiter in its\r\nascent, till it coils round your neck, a white choker!\r\n\r\n      [18]\r\n      Is this plural correct?--PUBLISHER.\r\n\r\n      I can't find walrus in the Latin dictionary nor anything else\r\n      beginning with W somehow, but it _seems_ all right.--ED.\r\n\r\nYes, the fog was playing a dark game, but Nora could see it and go one\r\nlighter (there were several on the stream we had quitted). She produced\r\na patent electric light.[19] Aided by this, we looked about us and saw\r\nthe strange denizens of the Zu.\r\n\r\n      [19]\r\n      Patent in the first sense of the word. She has not yet\r\n      received offers advantageous enough to close with in the other\r\n      sense.\r\n\r\nIt was now that the presence of mind of Leonora saved us. Foreseeing\r\nthe probability of an encounter with wild beasts, she had filled her\r\npracticable pocket (she belonged to the Rational Dress Association)\r\nwith buns and ginger-bread nuts.\r\n\r\nThe elephant now walked round, the wolves also circulated, the bear\r\nclimbed his pole, the great gorilla beat his breast and roared.\r\n\r\nLeonora was their match.\r\n\r\nFor the elephant she had a rusk, a bun for the bear, and the gorilla\r\nwas pacified by an offering of nuts from his native Brazil.\r\n\r\n                    THIS WAY TO THE CROCODILE HOUSE\r\n\r\nwe now read, on an inscription in black letters, and, following the\r\npath indicated, we reached the dank tank where the monsters dwell. We\r\nhad arrived at a place which I find it difficult to describe. The floor\r\nwas smooth and hard.\r\n\r\n'What do you make of _this_?' asked Leonora, tapping her dainty foot on\r\nthe floor.\r\n\r\n'Flags,' I replied phlagmatically, and she was silent.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the space was a dark pool, circled by crystalline\r\npalaces inhabited by the sacred snakes, from huge pythons to the\r\nterrapin proud of his tureen. Again, there was a whipsnake, and a toad,\r\nbloated as the aristocracy of old time, and puffed up as the plutocracy\r\nof to-day. For such is the lot of toads!\r\n\r\nNow a strange thing happened.\r\n\r\n'_Hark!_' said Ustani; '_hark! hark! hark!_ a den is opening!'\r\n\r\nHe was right; it was the den of a catawampuss, an animal whose habits\r\nare so well known that I need not delay to describe them.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the dark pool in the middle of the vague space lay one\r\ncrocodile. The rest were sleeping on the banks. The catawampuss\r\nsecretly emerged from its den--horror, I am not ashamed to say,\r\nprevented me from interfering--stealthily crept across the cold floor,\r\nand, true to the instincts of all the feline tribe,[20] made straight\r\nfor the water.\r\n\r\n      [20]\r\n      _Is_ the catawampuss one of the Felidae?--PUBLISHER.\r\n\r\n      Of course he is. Look at his name!--ED.\r\n\r\n'Ah!' cried Ustani, 'he's going for him!'\r\n\r\nThe expression was ambiguous, but we understood it.\r\n\r\nThe catawampuss, cunning as the dread jerboa, crept to the edge of the\r\npool, took a header into it, and then, still true to the feline\r\ninstincts, _swimming on its back_, made its way to the crocodile. In\r\nthis manner it caught the crocodile by the tail and waked it. When the\r\ntail of a crocodile awakes the head awakes also. The crocodile's head,\r\nthen, waking as the catawampuss seized its tail, caught the tail of the\r\ncatawampuss. The interview was hurried and tumultuous.\r\n\r\nThe crocodile had one of his ears chawed off (first blood for the\r\ncatawampuss), but this was a mere temporary advantage. When next we saw\r\nclearly through the tempest of flying fur and scales, the head of the\r\ncatawampuss _had entirely disappeared_, and the animal was clearly\r\nmuch distressed.\r\n\r\nThen, all of a sudden, the end came.\r\n\r\n_They had swallowed each other!_\r\n\r\nNot a vestige of either was left!\r\n\r\nThis duel was a wonderful and shocking sight, and was therefore\r\nwithdrawn, by request, as the patrons of the Gardens are directly\r\ninterested in the morality of the establishment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nAMONG THE LO-GROLLAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to escape from our perilous position on the banks of a pestilential\r\nstream, haunted by catawampodes and other fell birds of prey, now\r\nbecame a subject for consideration. Our object, of course, was to reach\r\nthe people of the Lo-grollas, through whose region, according to the\r\nprophecy, we must pass before finding the Magician that should guide us\r\nto the mummy. Our perplexity was only increased by the discovery that\r\nwe were surrounded on every side by the walls and houses of a gigantic\r\ncity. Stealing out by the canal as we had entered, we found to our\r\ncomfort that this must be the very city mentioned by Theodolite. As the\r\nseeress had declared, a deep and noisome night always prevailed, only\r\nbroken here and there as a wanderer scratched one of Bryant & May's\r\nmatches and painfully endeavoured to decipher the number on the door of\r\nhis house. The streets, moreover, were strewn and interwoven with long\r\nstrings of iron fallen from the sky.\r\n\r\n'_The people who wire themselves with wires_,' whispered Leonora; 'what\r\ndo you think of my interpretation _now_?'\r\n\r\n'I shall inquire,' I answered, and I _did_ inquire for the land of the\r\nLo-grollas, but in vain.\r\n\r\nHappily we chanced to meet an old man, clothed in a whitish robe of\r\nsome unknown substance, not unlike paper. This fluttering vesture was\r\nmarked with strange characters, in black and red, which Leonora was\r\nable to interpret. She read them thus. They were but fragmentary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    +-----------------------+\r\n    |     SP\" \"AL           |\r\n    |                       |\r\n    |   VORCE  C\"SE.        |\r\n    |                       |\r\n    | WAR \"\" \"URKEY.        |\r\n    |                       |\r\n    |   P\"L  \"\"LL  \"\"ZETTE. |\r\n    +-----------------------+\r\n]\r\n\r\nOn the fragments the words, 'Tragedy,' 'Awful Revelations,' 'Purity,'\r\nand other apparently inconsistent hieroglyphics might be deciphered.\r\n\r\nHe had a large and ragged staff; on his back he carried a vast Budget,\r\nand he was always asking everybody, 'Won't you put something in the\r\nBudget?'\r\n\r\n'Father,' said Leonora, in a respectful tone, 'canst thou tell us the\r\nway to the land of the people called Lo-grolla, and the place of the\r\nRolling of Logs.'\r\n\r\nHe stroked his beautiful white beard, and smiled faintly.\r\n\r\n'Indeed, child, we not only know it, but ourselves discovered it and\r\nwrote it up--we mean, sent our representative,' he answered.\r\n\r\nIt was a peculiarity of this man that he always spoke, like royalty, in\r\nthe first person plural.\r\n\r\n'And if a daughter may ask,' said Leonora, 'what is the name of my\r\nfather?'\r\n\r\nStedfastly regarding her, he answered, 'Our name is Pellmelli.'\r\n\r\n'And whither go we, my father?'\r\n\r\n'That you shall see--as soon, that is, as the fog lifts, or as our\r\nrepresentative has made interest with a gas company.'\r\n\r\nWith these words he furnished an unequalled supply of litter, which\r\ncame, he said, 'from the office,' where there was plenty, and we were\r\nborne rapidly in a westward direction.\r\n\r\nAs we journeyed, old Pellmelli gave us a good deal of information about\r\nthe Lo-grollas, whom he did not seem to like.\r\n\r\nThey were, he said, a savage and treacherous tribe, inhabiting for the\r\nmost part the ruined abodes of some kingly race of old.\r\n\r\nThe names of their chief dwellings, he told us, were still called, in\r\nsome ancient and long-lost speech,\r\n\r\n'The Academy,' and 'The Athenaeum.'\r\n\r\nLeonora, whose knowledge of languages was extensive and peculiar, told\r\nPellmelli that these names were derived from the old Greek.\r\n\r\n'Ah,' said he, 'you have clearly drunk of the wisdom of the past, and\r\nthy hands have held the water of the world's knowledge. Know you Latin\r\nalso?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, O Pellmelli,' replied Leonora, and Pellmelli said he preferred\r\nmodern tongues, though it would often be useful to him if he did in his\r\ndealings with the Lo-grollas.\r\n\r\n'However, if our Greek is a little to seek, our Russian is O.K.,' he\r\nsaid proudly.\r\n\r\nHe was very bitter against the Lo-grollas.\r\n\r\nThe Lo-grollas' favourite weapon, he told us, was the club, and he even\r\nproposed to show us this instrument.\r\n\r\nOur litter presently stopped outside a stately palace.\r\n\r\nThe street was dark, as always in this strange city, but old Pellmelli\r\npaused, sniffed, and, bending his ear to the ground, listened intently.\r\n\r\n'I smell the incense,' he said, 'and hear the melodious Rolling of the\r\nLogs. But they shall know their master!'\r\n\r\nThus speaking, he led us into a vast hall, where the Lo-grollas were\r\nsitting or standing, 'offering each other incense,' as Pellmelli\r\nremarked, from thin tubes of paper, which smoked at one end.\r\n\r\n'Now listen,' said Pellmelli, and he cried aloud the name of a poet\r\nknown to the Lo-grollas.\r\n\r\nInstantly we heard, from I know not what recess, a rolling fire of\r\napplause and admiration, which swept past us with stately and solemn\r\nmusic, like a hymn of praise.\r\n\r\n'_There_,' said Pellmelli, 'I told you so. This is the place of the\r\nRolling of Logs, and yourselves have heard it.'\r\n\r\nLeonora said she did not mind how often she heard it, as she quite\r\nagreed with the sentiments.\r\n\r\n'Not so!' said Pellmelli; and he cried aloud another name--the name of\r\na poetaster--which was almost strange to us.\r\n\r\nThen followed through that vasty hall a sharp and rattling crash, as of\r\nthe descent of innumerable slates.\r\n\r\n'Great heavens!' whispered Leonora, 'remember the writing; _the place\r\nwhere they slate strangers_!'\r\n\r\nAs _we_ were strangers, and wholly unknown to the Lo-grollas, we\r\nthought they might slate _us_, and, beating a hasty retreat, soon found\r\nourselves with Pellmelli in the dark outer air.\r\n\r\n'They are a desperate lot,' said he; 'they won't ever put anything in\r\nthe Budget.'\r\n\r\nHe was quivering with indignation; and Leonora, to soothe him, told him\r\nthe story of our quest for the mummy, and asked him if he could help\r\nus.\r\n\r\n'We are your man,' said he. 'We propose to-morrow to send our\r\nrepresentative to interview a magician who has just arrived in this\r\ncountry. He is a mysterious character; his name is Asher,[21] and it is\r\nsaid that he is the Wandering Jew, or, at all events, has lived for\r\nmany centuries. He, if any one, can direct you in your search.'\r\n\r\n      [21]\r\n      Pronounced _Assha_.--ED.\r\n\r\nHe then appointed a place where his representative should meet us next\r\nday, and we separated, Pellmelli taking his staff, and going off to\r\nlead an excursion against the Ama-Tory, a brutal and licentious tribe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nHE.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext day Leonora was suffering from a slight feverish cold, and I don't\r\nwonder at it considering what we suffered in the Zu. I therefore went\r\nalone to the rendezvous where I was to meet 'our representative.'\r\n\r\nTo my surprise, nobody was there but old Pellmelli himself.\r\n\r\n'Why, you said you would send your representative!' I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n'We are our usual representative,' he answered rather sulkily. 'Come\r\non, for we have to call on Messrs. Apples, the famous advertisers.'\r\n\r\n'Why?' said I.\r\n\r\n'Can you ask?' he replied. 'Can aught be more interesting than an\r\nadvertiser?'\r\n\r\n'_I_ call it log rolling,' I answered; but he was silent.\r\n\r\nHe went at a great pace, and presently, in a somewhat sordid street,\r\npointed his finger silently to an object over a door.\r\n\r\n_It was the carven head of an Ethiopian!_\r\n\r\nThis new confirmation of the prophecy gave me quite a turn, especially\r\nwhen I read the characters inscribed beneath--\r\n\r\n                     TRY OUR FINE NEGRO'S HEAD!\r\n\r\n'Here dwells the sorcerer, even Asher,' said Pellmelli, and began to\r\ncrawl upstairs on his hands and knees.\r\n\r\n'Why do you do that?' I asked, determined, if I must follow Pellmelli,\r\nat all events not to follow his example.\r\n\r\n'It is the manner of the tribe of Interviewers, my daughter. Ours is a\r\nblessed task, yet must we feign humility, or the savage people kick us\r\nand drive us forth with our garments rent.'\r\n\r\nHe now humbly tapped at a door, and a strange voice cried,\r\n\r\n'_Entrez!_'\r\n\r\nPellmelli (whose Russian is his strong point) paused in doubt, but I\r\nexplained that the word was French for 'come in.'\r\n\r\nHe crawled in on his stomach, while I followed him erect, and we found\r\nourselves before a strange kind of tent. It had four posts, and a\r\nbroidered veil was drawn all round it.\r\n\r\nWithin the veil the sorcerer was concealed, and he asked in a gruff\r\ntone,\r\n\r\n'Wadyerwant?'\r\n\r\nPellmelli explained that he had come to receive a brief personal\r\nstatement for the Budget.\r\n\r\nThe Voice replied, without hesitation, 'The Centuries and the AEons\r\npass, and I too make the pass. _Je saute la coupe_,' he added, in a\r\nforeign tongue. 'While thy race wore naught but a little blue paint, I\r\ndwelt among the forgotten peoples. The Red Sea knows me, and the Nile\r\nhas turned scarlet at my words. I am Khoot Hoomi, I am also the Chela\r\nof the Mountain!'\r\n\r\n'Now it is my turn to ask _you_ a few easy questions.\r\n\r\n'Who sitteth on the throne of Hokey, Pokey, Winky Wum, the Monarch of\r\nthe Anthropophagi?\r\n\r\n'Have the Jews yet come to their land, or have the owners of the land\r\ngone to the Jews?\r\n\r\n'Doth Darius the Mede yet rule, or hath his kingdom passed to the\r\nBassarids?'\r\n\r\nAs Pellmelli was utterly floored by these inquiries (which indicated\r\nthat the sorcerer had been for a considerable time out of the range of\r\nthe daily papers), I answered them as well as I could.\r\n\r\nWhen his very natural curiosity had been satisfied by a course of\r\nMangnall's Questions, I ventured to broach my own business.\r\n\r\nHe said he did not deal in mummies himself, though he had a stuffed\r\ncrocodile very much at my service; but would I call to-morrow, and\r\nbring Leonora? He added that he had known of our coming by virtue of\r\nhis secret art of divination. 'And thyself,' he added, 'shalt gaze\r\nwithout extra charge in the Fountain of Knowledge.'\r\n\r\nThrusting a withered yellow hand out of the mystic tent, he pointed to\r\na table where stood a small circular dish or cup of white earthenware,\r\ncontaining some brown milky liquid.\r\n\r\n'Gaze therein!' said the sorcerer.\r\n\r\nI gazed--_There was a Stranger in the tea!_\r\n\r\nDeeply impressed with the belief (laugh at it if you will) that I was\r\nin the presence of a being of more than mortal endowments, I was\r\nwithdrawing, when my glance fell on his weird familiars,--two tailless\r\ncats. This prodigy made me shudder, and I said, in tones of the deepest\r\nawe and sympathy, 'Poor puss!'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' came the strange voice from within the tent, 'they are _born_\r\nwithout tails. I bred them so; it hath taken many centuries and much\r\ntrouble, but at last I have triumphed. Once, too, I reared a breed of\r\ndogs with two tails, but after a while they became a proverb for pride;\r\nNature loathed them, and they perished. [Greek: Chaire!] _Vale!_'[22]\r\n\r\n      [22]\r\n      I have consulted the authorities at the British Museum, who\r\n      tell me these are the Greek and the Latin words for 'Don't you\r\n      think you had better go? Get out!'--ED.\r\n\r\nThis, though not understood, of course, by Pellmelli, was as good as an\r\ninvitation to withdraw, so I induced the old man to come away,\r\npromising the magician I would return on the morrow.\r\n\r\nWho was this awful man, to whom centuries were as moments, whose very\r\ncorrespondence, as I had noticed, came through the Dead Letter Office,\r\nand who spoke in the tongues of the dead past?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE POWER OF HE.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext day Leonora, the Boshman, and I returned to the home of the mage.\r\nHe stood before us, a tall thin figure enwrapped in yellowish, strange\r\ngarments, of a singular and perfumed character--spicy in fact--which\r\nproduced upon me a feeling which I cannot attempt to describe, and\r\nwhich I can only vaguely hint at by saying that the whole form conveyed\r\nto me the notion of _something wrapped up_.[23]\r\n\r\n      [23]\r\n      The public will say, so is your meaning.--PUBLISHER.\r\n\r\n      Don't give it away, but that's what I mean.--ED.\r\n\r\nWith a curious swaying motion which I have never seen anything\r\nlike--for he seemed less to be walking than to be impelled from behind\r\nlike a perambulator, or dragged from in front like a canal-boat--he\r\nadvanced to the table, where lay some pieces of a white substance like\r\npapyrus, all of the same size and oblong shape, which showed on their\r\nsurfaces, some of them antique-looking figures and faces curiously\r\nstained, and others red and black dots, arranged, as it seemed to me,\r\nin some sort of design, although at first sight they looked jumbled\r\nenough. Near to these lay a book bound in brown, but with heavy black\r\nand gold lettering, amid which I thought I could make out the words\r\n_Modern Magic_, and the name _Hoffmann_. The swathed figure poised\r\nitself a moment, resting one thin hand on the table, and then spoke.\r\n\r\n'There is naught that is wonderful about this matter,' it said, 'could\r\nyou but understand it. Prestigiation itself is wonderful, but that its\r\nphases and phrases should be changed is not wonderful. Not now, I ween,\r\nis the _gibeciere_ of the Ancient Wizard seen; not now the \"Presto,\r\npass!\" of the less ancient conjurer heard. Nay, all things change, yet\r\nI change not; that which is not yet cannot yet have taken place--at\r\nleast not its proper place; that which shall not be may yet come to a\r\nbad pass, and the blind race of man watches helpless the trammels it\r\ncould shake off did it but greatly dare. My business, ladies and\r\ngentlemen, now is, as I have just explained to you, to attempt to\r\npuzzle your eyes by the quickness of my fingers. Yours, on the other\r\nhand, will be to detect the way--or _modus operandi_, as old Simon\r\nMagus used to say--in which I perform my little wonders--if you can.\r\nWill any gentleman lend me a helmet--I mean a hat?'\r\n\r\nAs the only male person present was the Boshman, this appeared to me a\r\nfutile question, and even the stately Magician seemed to be struck by\r\nsome dim idea of the kind, for I could discern a pair of mysterious\r\neyes peering anxiously through his swathings, and I heard him mutter to\r\nhimself in several languages, 'Ought to have thought of that. No hat\r\npresent. Don't know any trick to produce one. Nothing about it in the\r\nbook.'\r\n\r\nBut he recovered himself quickly, and went on in clear cheerful tones,\r\n'Ladies and gentlemen, as no person present has a hat, I will proceed\r\nto another of the tricks on my little programme. Will any lady oblige\r\nme by drawing a card? Will you, madam?' he said, bowing with infinite\r\ngrace to Leonora.\r\n\r\nHer hand touched Asher's as she drew a card, and I saw a shiver pass\r\nover the veiled figure.\r\n\r\n'Will the lady on your left now oblige me?' he continued, turning to\r\nme, who was indeed standing on Leonora's left hand, though how he knew\r\nit is a thing I have never been able fully to understand.\r\n\r\n'Now, please,' he continued, 'look well at your cards, but do not show\r\nthem to me or to each other. _Basta. Assez._ [Greek: Konx Ompax]. Now,\r\nplease, still hiding the cards from me and from each other, exchange\r\nthem. Now,' he continued, his form dilating with conscious power, 'see\r\nhow true is it that change is perennial, even so far as magic and\r\nNature herself can be perennial. For she who held the King of Hearts\r\nnow holds the Queen of Spades, and she who held the Queen of Spades now\r\nholds the King of Hearts. Thus much among the shifting shadows of life\r\ncan I, the wizard, see as a sure and accomplished fact. Is it not so,\r\nmy children?'\r\n\r\nWe bowed in silence, overawed by the wonder of his presence, although\r\nLeonora whispered to me, 'He has got the cards wrong, but we had better\r\nsay nothing about it.'\r\n\r\n'And now,' he continued, 'look upon this glass (it was an ordinary\r\nwineglass) and on this silver coin,' producing a _stater_ of the\r\nEretrian Republic. 'See! I place the coin in the glass, and now can I\r\ntell you by its means what you will of the future. There is no magic in\r\nit, only a little knowledge of the secrets, mutable yet immutable, of\r\nNature. And this is an old secret. I did not find it. It was known of\r\nyore in Atlantis and in Chichimec, in Ur and in Lycosura. Even now the\r\nrude Boshmen keep up the tradition among their medicine-men. Vill any\r\nlady ask the coin a qvestion?' he continued, in a hoarse Semitic\r\nwhisper, for all currencies and all languages were alike to him. 'Sure\r\nit's the coin 'll be afther tellun' ye what ye like. Voulez-vous\r\ndemander, Mademoiselle? Wollen Sie, gnaedige Signora?'\r\n\r\n'Then,' said Leonora, in trembling accents, 'I demand to know if I\r\nshall find that which I seek.'\r\n\r\nThe figure, drawing itself up to its full height, passed its hand with\r\na proud, impatient, and mystic gesture across the glass, and then stood\r\nin the attitude of one who awaited a response. 'Should the coin, my\r\ndaughter, jump three times,' he said, 'the answer is yea. Should it\r\njump but once, nay.'\r\n\r\nWe waited anxiously. The coin did not jump at all! The wizard took up\r\nthe glass, shook it impatiently, and put it down again. Still the coin\r\nshowed no sign of animation. Then the wizard uttered some private\r\nejaculations in Hittite, but still the coin did not move. Then he\r\naffected an air of jauntiness, and said, 'I remember a circumstance of\r\na similar kind when I was playing odd man out ([Greek: tritos\r\nanthropos] dear old Sokrates used to call it) with Darius the night\r\nbefore Marathon. Darius was the Mede. _I_ was the Medium.' Then he\r\nseemed about to work another wonder, when he was interrupted by the\r\nharsh cackling laughter of the Boshman, who advanced with careless\r\ndefiance and observed in his own tongue, which we all knew perfectly,\r\nthat he 'could see all the tricks the wizard could do and go several\r\nbetter.' I waited, horror-struck, to see what would follow this\r\ninsolence.\r\n\r\nAsher made a movement so swift that I could scarcely follow it; but it\r\nseemed to me that he lightly laid his hand upon the poor Boshman's\r\nhead. I looked at Ustani, and then staggered back in wonder, for there\r\nupon his snowy hair, right across the wool-white tresses, were five\r\nfinger-marks _black as coal_.\r\n\r\n'Now go and stand in the corner,' said the magician, in a cold inhuman\r\nvoice. The unhappy Boshman tremblingly did his bidding, putting his\r\nhands to his head in a dazed way as he went, and, incredible as it may\r\nseem, thus transferring--as if the curse carried double force--some of\r\nthe black mark to his own fingers.\r\n\r\n'I will now,' continued the wizard, who had regained his ordinary\r\npolished, if somewhat swaying and overbalanced, manner--'I will now,\r\nwith your kind permission, show you a little trick which was a great\r\nfavourite with the late Tubal Cain when we were boys together. Observe,\r\nI take this paper-knife--it is an ordinary paper-knife--look at it for\r\nyourselves. I will place it on my down-turned hand. It is an ordinary\r\nhand--look at it for yourselves, but don't touch it; the consequences\r\nmight be disastrous.'\r\n\r\nI, for my part, having seen the consequences in the case of Ustani's\r\nhair, had no desire to do so.\r\n\r\n'You see,' continued the sorcerer, 'I place the paper-knife _there_! It\r\nfalls. Why? Because of gravity. What is gravity? Newton, as you know\r\nwell, invented the art; but what of that? Did he find that which did\r\nnot exist? No, for the non-existent is as though it had never been. But\r\nnow, availing myself of the resources of science, which is ever old and\r\never young, I clasp my wrist--the wrist of the hand on which the\r\npaper-knife rests--with the other hand, and--you see.'\r\n\r\nAs the sorcerer spoke, he deftly turned his hand palm downwards, and\r\nthe paper-knife fell with a crash and a clatter on the floor. It was\r\nterrible to see the dumb wrath of the swathed figure at this new\r\ndefeat.\r\n\r\nEven in this moment the Boshman glided like a serpent among us, picked\r\nup the paper-knife, and triumphantly performed the very miracle in\r\nwhich the wizard had failed. A harsh cackle of laughter announced his\r\nsuccess. But the mage was even with him, or rather he was 'odds and\r\nevens.' Rapidly he drew his forefinger across the Boshman's face,\r\nperpendicularly and horizontally--\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n      |  |\r\n    --+--+--\r\n      |  |\r\n    --+--+--\r\n      |  |\r\n]\r\n\r\nOn the skin of Ustani, azure with terror, appeared the above diagram in\r\nlines of white! The mage then made the sign of a +, thus--\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n      |  |+\r\n    --+--+--\r\n      |  |\r\n    --+--+--\r\n      |  |\r\n]\r\n\r\nand challenged Leonora to a contest of skill in 'oughts and crosses.'\r\nBut the Boshman, catching a view of his own altered aspect in a mirror,\r\nexclaimed, 'You 'standy Ustani? Him no standy He! Him show hisself for\r\ntin! Adults one shilling, kids tizzy. _Me Umslopoguey!_' And he sloped;\r\nnor did we ever again see this victim of an overwhelming Power\r\n(limited).\r\n\r\nWe presently took our leave of the mage, promising to call next day,\r\nand bring a policeman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nA BODY IN PAWN.\r\n\r\n    'Gin a body meet a body!'--BURNS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThough Leonora's faith in the magician had been a good deal shaken by\r\nhis failures in his black art, she admitted that, as a clairvoyant, he\r\nmight be more inspired. We therefore went, as he had directed us, to\r\nthe neighbourhood of Clare Market, where he had prophesied that we\r\nshould find a Temple adorned with the Three Balls of Gold, which the\r\nLombards bore with them from their far Aryan home in Frangipani. Nor\r\ndid this part of the prophecy fail to coincide with the document on the\r\nmummy case. Through the thick and choking darkness which has made 'The\r\nLights of London' a proverb, we beheld the glittering of three aureate\r\norbs. And now, how to win our way, without pass-word or, indeed,\r\npass-book, into this home of mystery?\r\n\r\nHere, in these immemorial recesses, the natives had long been wont to\r\nbury, as we learned, their oldest objects of interest and value. There,\r\nwhen we pushed our way within the swinging portal, lay around us, in\r\nvast and solemn pyramids of portable property, the silent and touching\r\nmonuments of human existence. The busy life of a nation lay sleeping\r\nhere! Here, for example, stood that ancestral instrument for the\r\nreckoning of winged Time, which in the native language is styled a\r\n'Grandfather's Clock.' Hard by lay the pipe, fashioned of the 'foam of\r\nperilous seas in fairy lands forlorn,' the pipe on which, perchance,\r\nsome swain had discoursed sweet music near the shady heights of High\r\nHolborn. The cradle of infancy, the gamp of decrepitude, the tricycle\r\nof fleeting youth, the paraffin lamp which had lighted bridal gaiety,\r\nthe flask which had held the foaming malt,--all were gathered here, and\r\nthe dust lay deep on all of them!\r\n\r\nI was about to make some appropriate moral remarks, when I heard\r\nLeonora (whose command of tongues is simply _marvellous_) address an\r\nattendant priestess in the local dialect.\r\n\r\n'Here, miss,' said she, ''ow much can yer let us 'ave on this 'ere\r\nticker?' (producing her watch).\r\n\r\nThe priestess, whose clear-cut features and two lovely black eyes\r\nbetrayed a mixture of Semitic blood, was examining the 'turnip'--as she\r\ncalled the watch--when Leonora, saying 'Mum's the word,' rather\r\nviolently called my attention (with her elbow) to a strange parcel\r\nlying apart from the rest.\r\n\r\nIt was a long bundle, as long as a man, and was swathed in cerements of\r\nwhite Egyptian tissue.\r\n\r\n''Tis you! 'tis you!' I sneezed rapturously, recognising the object of\r\nour search, the very mummy which, two thousand years ago, Theodolite\r\nhad prepared with her own fair but cruel hands.\r\n\r\nThere, beyond the shadow of doubt, lay all that was mortal of the\r\nunlucky Jambres! On the tissue which wrapped the bundle I distinctly\r\nrecognised _the stencilled mark corresponding to Leonora's scarab_, a\r\nduck, the egg of a duck, and an umbrella.[24]\r\n\r\n      [24]\r\n      See cover. Most important to have this cover bound in _sur\r\n      brochure_.--PUBLISHER.\r\n\r\n'How much,' said I to the priestess of the temple, 'could you afford to\r\nlet me have that old bundle of rags for?'\r\n\r\n'That old bundle of rags?' said the woman, 'Take it, dear lady, take it\r\nand keep it (if you can), and the blessing of Abraham be on your head!'\r\n\r\nSo anxious was she to part with the mummy that we could hardly get her\r\nto accept a merely nominal price. To give plausibility to the purchase,\r\nwe said we wanted the rags for a paper-mill. Joyously did Leonora and I\r\ncall a passing chariot, and, with the mummy between us, we drove to our\r\nabode. I was surprised on the way by receiving a pettish push from\r\nLeonora's foot.\r\n\r\n'Don't tread on my toes,' she said, though I had not even stirred. I\r\ntold her as much, and we were getting a little animated when my bonnet\r\nwas twitched off and thrown out into the darkness.\r\n\r\n'Leonora,' I said severely, 'these manners are unworthy of a lady!'\r\n\r\n'I declare, my dear Polly,' she replied, 'that I never even moved!' and\r\nas she was obviously in earnest I had to accept her word.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached home, after a series of petty but provoking\r\naccidents,[25] we first locked up the mummy very carefully in the spare\r\nbedroom. To-morrow would be time enough, we said, to consult the wizard\r\nas to our next movement. We ordered a repast of the native viands\r\n(which included, I remember, a small but savoury fish, the Blo-ta), and\r\nsought our couches, in better spirits than usual.\r\n\r\n      [25]\r\n      I say, are you not gliding insensibly into _The Fallen\r\n      Idol_?--PUBLISHER.\r\n\r\n      Not a bit, you wait and you'll see.--ED.\r\n\r\nNext morning, long before Leonora was awake, the young but intelligent\r\nSlavi (so the common people call housemaids) crept into my chamber with\r\na death-white face.\r\n\r\n'Omum,' she said (it is a term of courtesy), 'wot a night we've been\r\nhaving?'\r\n\r\n'Why, what is the matter, Jemimaran?' I asked, for that was her\r\nmelodious native name.\r\n\r\n'There's _something_ in the spare room, mum, a-carrying on horful. The\r\nbell ringing all night, and the Thing screaming and walking up and down\r\nas restless! I'm a-going to give warning, mum,' she added\r\nconfidentially.\r\n\r\n'Why, you've _given_ it,' I said, to reassure her. 'Forewarned is\r\nforearmed.'\r\n\r\n'Four-legged It do run sometimes, like a beast, mum, wailing terrible.\r\nUp and down, up and down It goes, and always ringing the bell, and\r\ncrying high for a brandy-and-soda, mum, like a creature tormented.'[26]\r\n\r\n      [26]\r\n      Do take care. This is copyright! Don't you remember Mr.\r\n      Hyde?--PUBLISHER.\r\n\r\n      Neither Hyde nor Hidol, you're so nervous. Do wait till the\r\n      end.--ED.\r\n\r\n      Wish it was come!--PUBLISHER.\r\n\r\n'Well,' I asked, though every hair upon my head stood erect with horror\r\n(adding greatly to the peculiarity of my appearance), 'well, did you\r\ntake It what It asked for?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, mum; for very fear I dared not refuse. And when I had handed it\r\nin by a chink in the open door, first there was a sound like drinking,\r\nthen an awful cry, \"Potash again!\" and then a heavy soft thud, as if\r\nyou had knocked over a bolster stuffed with lead, mum.'\r\n\r\nThrough the brown glimmer of dawn (it was about ten A.M.) I hurried\r\nto Leonora's chamber. She was dressed, and came out. 'What do you\r\nadvise?' I asked.\r\n\r\n'Send for Mr. Urmson, the eminent lawyer, at once,' said she, 'he is\r\nused to this kind of thing. Nothing like taking Counsel's opinion. But\r\nfirst let me knock the door open!' She applied her magnificent white\r\nshoulder to the door, which flew into splinters.\r\n\r\nThere was not a trace of the mummy, but there, in a deprecatory\r\nattitude, stood the philosopher Asher![27]\r\n\r\n      [27]\r\n      Please pronounce _Assha_.--ED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTHE WIZARD UNBOSOMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Sir,' said Leonora, 'may I request you to inform me why we find you,\r\nrampaging an unbidden guest, in the chamber which is sacred to\r\nhospitality?'\r\n\r\n'[Greek: Ten d' apameibomenos prosephe koruthaiolos] Asher,' answered\r\nthe magician, dreamily. 'Do my senses deceive me, or--that voice, that\r\nwinsome bearing--am I once more with Helen on the walls of Ilion?'\r\n\r\n'No, sir, you are in 30 Acacia Gardens,' replied Leonora, severely.\r\n'_Why_, permit me to repeat myself, do I find you here, an unbidden\r\nguest?'\r\n\r\n'To say that I never guessed you'd find me here,' answered the\r\nmagician, 'might seem a mere trifling with language and with your\r\nfeelings.'\r\n\r\n'My feelings!' exclaimed the proud girl, indignantly, 'just as if----\r\nBut answer me!'\r\n\r\n'When a man has seen as much of life as I have,' answered the magician,\r\n'when the AEons are to him merely as drops in a bucket which he will\r\nnever kick--and when he suffers,' he added mournfully, 'from attacks of\r\nmultiplex personality, he recognises the futility of personal\r\nexplanations.'\r\n\r\n'At least I can compel you to tell us _Where is the mummy?_' said\r\nLeonora.\r\n\r\n'I am, or lately was, that mummy,' said the wizard, haughtily; then,\r\ndrawing himself up to his full height, he added, 'I am the REAL\r\nJAMBRES! Old Gooseberry Jamberries,' he added solemnly. 'No other is\r\ngenuine!'\r\n\r\n'You are playing, sir, on our credulity,' replied the girl; 'no living\r\nman can be a mummy,--outside of the House of Lords or the Royal\r\nAcademy.'\r\n\r\n'You speak,' he said tenderly, 'with the haste of youth and\r\ninexperience. When you have lived as long as I have, you will know\r\nbetter. Hearken to my story.\r\n\r\n'Three or four thousand years ago--for what is time?--I was the\r\nauthorised magician at the Court of Ptolemy Patriarchus. I had a\r\nrival--the noted witch Theodolite. In an evil hour she won me by a show\r\nof false affection, and, taking advantage of my passion, mummified me\r\nalive. To this I owe my remarkable state of preservation at an advanced\r\nage. _Tres bien conserve_,' he added fatuously.\r\n\r\n'But she only half accomplished her purpose. By some accident, which\r\nhas never been explained, and in spite of the stress of competition,\r\nshe had purchased _pure_ salts of potash for the execution of her fell\r\npurpose in place of _adulterated_ salts of soda.\r\n\r\n'To this I owe it that I am now a living man; and in a moment----'\r\n\r\nA certain stiffness of demeanour, which we had noticed, but ascribed to\r\npride, worked an unspeakable change in the mage. As we looked at him\r\n_he hardened into our cheap mummy_.\r\n\r\n'Here's a jolly go!' said Leonora, her mind submerged in terror.\r\n\r\nI sprang to the bell, '_Soda water at once!_' I cried, and the _slavi_\r\nappeared with the fluid. We applied it to the parched lips of the\r\nmummy, and Jambres was himself again.\r\n\r\n'Now will you tell me?' I asked, when he had been given a cigarette and\r\nmade comfortable, 'why we found you--I mean the mummy--under the Three\r\nBalls?'\r\n\r\n''Twas a pledge,' he replied. 'When my resources ran low, and my rent\r\nwas unpaid, the landlady used to take advantage of my condition and\r\nraise a small sum on me.'\r\n\r\nAll seemed now explained; but Leonora was not yet satisfied.\r\n\r\n'You have----' she began.\r\n\r\n'Yes, a strawberry mark,' he replied wearily, 'on the usual place!'\r\n\r\n'The quest is accomplished,' I said.\r\n\r\n'Nay,' replied Jambres, to give him his real name. 'There is still the\r\nadventure of the Siege Perilous.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTHE WIZARD'S SCHEME.\r\n\r\n\r\n'We must, as you are aware, visit the Siege Perilous in the Hall of\r\nEgypt, and risk ourselves in the chair of the Viewless Maiden, of Her\r\nthat is not to be seen of Man.'\r\n\r\n'We know it,' said Leonora.\r\n\r\n'It is,' continued the mage, 'your wish to accomplish the end for which\r\nyou set forth. This seems to you an easy matter enough; young hearts\r\nare full of such illusions, and, believe me, I would willingly change\r\nmy years, which are lost in geological time, for one hand's breadth of\r\nyour daring. Know, then,' continued this strange creature, 'that the\r\ntime has now come when matters must be brought to an end between us. It\r\nwill be my business, and, I will add, my pleasure,' he continued with a\r\nlofty air which sat drolly enough upon him in his yellow duds, 'to\r\nconduct you to the Siege Perilous. From you, in return, I must exact an\r\nunquestioning obedience; and I will add a measureless _confidence_. I\r\nbeg you to bear in mind that the slightest resistance to my will must\r\nbe followed by consequences of which you cannot estimate either the\r\nreach or the extension.'\r\n\r\nThere was such a parrot-like pomp about the creature's tautology, and\r\nsuch an old-world affectation of fine manners \\in his constant\r\nobeisances, that I could hold it no longer, but fairly laughed out in\r\nhis face.\r\n\r\nI dreaded, it is true, lest some such fate as Ustani's might punish me\r\nfor my temerity, but for reasons which doubtless seemed sufficient to\r\nhimself the wizard merely looked at me through his veil, shook himself\r\na little in his swathings, and said in a matter-of-fact voice, 'Well,\r\nwell, perhaps we have had enough of such talk as this. Let's get ahead\r\nwith the business before us. That business is to reach the Siege\r\nPerilous, or Magic Chair. Thither will I guide ye, and there ye shall\r\nsee what ye shall see. But first it is needful, as all sages have\r\ndeclared, that ye shall show your confidence in me! I value not wealth.\r\nGold is mere dross--nay, I have the mines of King Solomon at my\r\ndisposal. But when the weary King Ecclesiast confided to me, in his\r\npalace of ivory and cedar in Jerusalem, long ago, the secret of these\r\ndiamond treasures, he bade me reveal it to none who did not show their\r\nconfidence in me.\r\n\r\n'Let _them_ entrust _you_,' said Solomon, 'with their paltry wealth,\r\nere _you_ place in _their_ hands opulence beyond the dreams of\r\navarice. Give me, then, merely as a sign of confidence, gold, much\r\ngold, or,' he continued in a confidential and Semitic tone, 'its\r\nequivalent in any safe securities, American railways preferred. Don't\r\nbring bank-notes, my dear--risky things, risky things! Why, when I was\r\npals with Claude Duval--but 'tis gone, 'tis gone! Now, my dears, what\r\nhave you got? what have you got?'\r\n\r\n'I have,' answered Leonora, in her clear sweet voice and girlish\r\ntrustfulness, 'as is my invariable custom, my _dot_, namely,\r\n300,000_l._ worth of American railway shares, chiefly Chicago N.W. and\r\nL. & N., in my pocket.'\r\n\r\n'That's right, my dear, that's right,' said the Erie wizard; 'just hand\r\nthose to me, and then we can start at once.\r\n\r\n                '_And when_ (he went on in italics)\r\n                            _o my Leonora\r\n                when that mystic change has been worked\r\n                      which has been predestined\r\n              for countless ages and which shall come as\r\n                            sure as fate,\r\n                      then on another continent\r\n             kindred to thine yet strange, even in the land\r\n                of the railways that thy shares are in,\r\n                             Thou and I,\r\n                     the Magician and the Novice,\r\n                  the Celebrated Wizard of the West\r\n                      and his Accomplished Pupil\r\n                         Mademoiselle Leonore\r\n                will make a tour that shall drag in the\r\n                               dollars\r\n                      by the hatful. NOW COME!'_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTHE PERILOUS PATH.\r\n\r\n\r\nForth we rushed into the darkness, through the streaming deluge of that\r\ntropic clime. For the seraphic frenzy had now come upon the mage in\r\ngood earnest, and all the Thought-reader burned in his dusky eyes.\r\n\r\nWe presented, indeed, a strange spectacle, for the mage, in his silvery\r\nswathings, held Leonora by the hands, and Leonora held me, as we raced\r\nthrough the gloom.\r\n\r\nIn any other city our aspect and demeanour had excited attention and\r\nclaimed the interference of the authorities.\r\n\r\nIn Berlin Uhlans would have charged us, in Paris grape-shot would have\r\nploughed through our ranks. _Here_ they deemed we were but of the\r\nsacred race of Thought-readers, who, by a custom of the strange people,\r\nare permitted to run at random through the streets and even to enter\r\nprivate houses.\r\n\r\nWe were not even followed, in our headlong career, by a crowd, for the\r\npublic had ceased to interest itself in frenzied research for hidden\r\npins or concealed cigarettes.\r\n\r\nAfter a frantic chase Jambres (late 'the Mage') paused, breathless, in\r\nfront of a building of portentous proportions.\r\n\r\nHow it chanced I have never been able to understand, but, as I am a\r\nliving and honourable woman, this hall had the characteristics of\r\nancient Egyptian architecture, and that (miraculous as it may appear)\r\nin perfect preservation.\r\n\r\nThere are the hypostyle halls, the two Osirid pillars--colossal figures\r\nof strange gods, in coloured relief--there is the great blue scarab,\r\nthe cartouche, the _pschent_, the _pschutt_, and all that we admire in\r\nthe Rameseum of the Ancient Empire.\r\n\r\nBut all was silent, all was deserted; the vast adamantine portals were\r\nclosed.\r\n\r\nJambres paused in dismay.\r\n\r\n'Since I last gave an exhibition of mine art in those halls,' said\r\nhe, '('twas in old forgotten days, in Bosco's palmy time), much is\r\naltered. OPEN SESAME!' he cried; but, curious to say, _nothing\r\nopened_!\r\n\r\nAt that moment a dark figure crawled submissively to our feet. It was\r\nold Pellmelli.\r\n\r\nHis instinct for 'copy' had brought him on our track, and he began--\r\n\r\n'As our representative, I am commissioned----'\r\n\r\nJambres (late 'Asher') turned from him, and he fell (still making\r\nnotes) prone on his face, where we left him, as the pace was too good\r\nto inquire.\r\n\r\nThe mage now reconnoitred carefully the vast facade of the Hall of\r\nEgypt, and finally fixed his gaze on a perpendicular leaden column,\r\nadorned with strange symbols, through which (for it was a rainy night)\r\nraging torrents of water were distinctly heard flowing downwards to who\r\nknows what abysmal and unfathomable depths?\r\n\r\nIn this weird climate it was the familiar yet dreaded _waterspout_!\r\n\r\nJambres, with the feline agility of a catapult of the mountain, began\r\nto climb the perpendicular leaden channel to which he had called our\r\nattention, and of course we had to follow him. It was perfectly\r\nmarvellous to see the ease and grace with which he skipped and hopped\r\nup the seemingly naked face of the wall. There were places indeed where\r\nour position was perilous enough, and it did not add to our\r\ncheerfulness to hear the horrid roaring and gurgling of the unseen and\r\nimprisoned waters that poured down the channel with a violence which\r\nseemed as if they might at any moment burst their bonds. Helped,\r\nhowever, by certain ledges which projected from the wall beneath square\r\nopenings filled with some transparent substance, on which ledges from\r\ntime to time we rested, we arrived at the steep crest, and paused for\r\nrepose beneath the leafy shade of the roof-tree, Jambres lightly\r\nleading the way.\r\n\r\n'Now,' said Jambres, 'comes the most delicate part of our journey.'\r\n\r\nSo indeed it proved, for the mage began rapidly to divest himself of\r\nhis mysterious swathings. Wrapper by wrapper he undid, cerement on\r\ncerement, till both Leonora and I wondered when he would stop.\r\n\r\nStop he did, however, and, with a practised hand, shot his linen into\r\none long rope, which he carefully attached to an erect and smoking\r\npillar, perhaps of basaltic formation, perhaps an ancient altar of St.\r\nSimeon Skylites. When all was taut, Jambres approached a slanting\r\nslope, smooth and transparent, perhaps of glacial origin. On this he\r\nstamped, and the fragments tinkled as they fell into unknown deeps.\r\nThen he seized the rope, let himself down, and from far below we heard\r\nhis voice calling to us to follow him.\r\n\r\nLeonora and I descended with agility to some monstrous basin in the\r\nabyss--the Pit, Jambres called it. Here Jambres met us, and bade us\r\nlight the railway reading-lamps which, as I forgot to mention, we had\r\nbrought with us. Then, jumping off with the lead, he advanced along the\r\nfloor, picking his way with great care, as indeed it was most necessary\r\nto do, for the floor was strewn with strange forms, stumbling over the\r\nlegs and backs of which it would have been easy to break one's own.\r\nWhen we halted, brought up by a barrier, of which I did not at first\r\ndiscern the nature, our lamps (as is sometimes the way of some such\r\npatent lamps[28]) suddenly went out. Jambres whispered hoarsely, 'Wot\r\nare yer waitin' for? Come on; [Greek: all' age]. _Nunc est scandendum._'\r\nWe saw before us a vast expanse, of which it was impossible to gauge\r\nthe extent, so impenetrable, so overpowering was the gloom of its\r\nblackness. 'It is the abode,' said Jambres, mysteriously, 'of my rival\r\nDe Kolta!' He himself, owing to his use of his swathings, was\r\nsufficiently _decollete_\r\n\r\n      [28]\r\n      I think I've managed not to be libellous.--ED.\r\n\r\n      We shall see.--PUBLISHER.\r\n\r\nOn the hither side was a row of _lumieres a pied_ which seemed _afloat_\r\non the darkness, and in their centre a sudden chasm which looked as if\r\nit had been made by human agency. The fitful moonbeams[29] showed us a\r\nmost curious and accurately shaped spur, or _run-down_ as it is called\r\nin the native dialect, which connected the floor on which we stood with\r\nthe darkness beyond.\r\n\r\n      [29]\r\n      You've not mentioned them before.--PUBLISHER.\r\n\r\n      That's why I do now.--ED.\r\n\r\nWhat mortal, however hardy, dared cross this quivering wavering bridge\r\nin the total darkness? Beneath our feet it swayed and leaped like\r\nrotten ice on the magic Serpentine.\r\n\r\n'Hush,' cried Jambres, 'it comes, it comes! Be still!'\r\n\r\nEven as he spoke, we saw a _long shaft of yellow light_ streaming\r\nfrom an unknown centre, and searching out the recesses of the cavern.\r\n\r\n'Be still, as you value your liberty,' whispered Jambres. 'The Bobi is\r\non his beat.'\r\n\r\nThen, as the long shaft smote the swaying bridge, he lightly crossed\r\nit, and beckoned us to follow. We obeyed, and in another instant all\r\nwas again darkness.\r\n\r\n'He has gone his round,' said Jambres. 'Won't be back for hours!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nTHE MAGIC CHAIR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere, on the plateau, or platform, we had seen, stood, in naked\r\nmystery, the Enchanted Chair.\r\n\r\n''Tis the weird chair of the Viewless Maiden, the place of Her who is\r\nno more seen,' said Jambres. 'Who shall sit therein?'\r\n\r\n'The writing said,' remarked the dauntless Leonora, 'that a descendant\r\nof Theodolite must achieve this adventure. I am ready.'\r\n\r\n'Nay, not so, maiden,' murmured Jambres, 'try it not till I have made\r\nexperience thereof. Me it cannot harm; in me you see the original\r\ninventor; beware of spurious imitations. But it is a dread experience;\r\nlet me work it first!'\r\n\r\nLeonora could not resist his winning manner and concern for her safety.\r\n\r\n'I move,' she said, 'that Mr. Jambres do take the chair at this\r\nmeeting.'\r\n\r\n'I second that proposal,' said I, and there was not a dissentient\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n'Mr. Jambres will now take the chair,' said Leonora, and the wizard,\r\nhis swathing robes bulging with Leonora's securities, glided forward.\r\n\r\nThen an awful thing occurred. No sooner had Jambres sat down than\r\nLeonora and I found ourselves--how can we expect it to be\r\nbelieved?--gazing on a blank, bare space!\r\n\r\nThe chair was still there, but the wizard was gone. Leonora turned to\r\nme, horror in her eyes, her golden curls changed to a pale German\r\nsilver.\r\n\r\n'It is the chair of the Vanishing Lady,' she said.\r\n\r\n'It is the Confidence Trick,' I cried; and we both lost consciousness\r\nas the true state of the case flashed on our minds. The wizard was off\r\nwith 300,000_l._ in high-class American securities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat remains to be told is of little public interest. When we came to\r\nourselves, all was darkness. Escape seemed impossible.\r\n\r\nWe could not swarm up the rope, by the way we had come.\r\n\r\nWe knew not when the shaft of yellow light might return on its beat.\r\n\r\nWe lit a Bryant & May's match, and thereby groped our way downwards,\r\never downwards.\r\n\r\nFinally, as we had given up all for lost, Leonora said, 'Don't you\r\nthink the air is a little stuffy?'\r\n\r\nWe sniffed about the rocky floor, and found an iron grating.\r\n\r\nIt yielded to a strong tug, and we descended into subterranean\r\npassages, framed by the art of men, through which rolled and surged\r\ntorrents of turbid water.\r\n\r\nThrough these we waded, attacked by armies of rats, till, thank\r\ngoodness! we saw a moving light, flashing hither and thither on the\r\ntorrent.\r\n\r\nHalf swimming, half wading, we reached the bearer of the light.\r\n\r\nIt was old Pellmelli, 'doing a Sanitary special,' as he told us.\r\n\r\nWe, somewhat deceitfully, led him to believe that we had lost ourselves\r\non a similar errand, for a rival Budget, with which he was concerned in\r\na Paper Mill.[30]\r\n\r\n      [30]\r\n      What do you mean by a Paper Mill?--PUBLISHER.\r\n\r\n      A Journalistic War, then.--ED.\r\n\r\nOn our faithfully promising to give him exclusive information about our\r\nadventures, 'for an Extra,' as he said, old Pellmelli conducted us to\r\nan orifice in the rock, whence we escaped, at last, into the light of\r\nsuch day as dwells in the Dark City.\r\n\r\nOur hopes now entirely rest on finding Jambres again, but it may be, of\r\ncourse, a good three or four thousand years before that.\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nHere this strange narrative closes; and as I end my editorial task, I\r\nhave only one question to ask myself--Will this thing go on? will\r\nJambres and Leonora meet? will the Americans give up Jambres under the\r\nExtradition Act? or----\r\n\r\nIs the great drama Played Out?--ED.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINTED BY\r\nSPOTTISWOODE AND CO., NEW-STREET SQUARE\r\nLONDON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA SEQUEL TO 'KING SOLOMON'S MINES.'\r\n\r\n                            *      *      *\r\n\r\nALLAN QUATERMAIN:\r\n\r\nBEING AN ACCOUNT OF HIS FURTHER ADVENTURES AND DISCOVERIES\r\n\r\nIN COMPANY WITH SIR HENRY CURTIS, BART.
