I fought for them.\"\r\n\r\n                                                          --BLACK HAWK\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK 1\r\n\r\n1825\r\n\r\n\r\nMoon of Ice\r\n\r\n_January_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nThe Lodge of the Turtle\r\n\r\n\r\nThe black bearskin, softened by countless wearings, clasped Gray Cloud's\r\narms and shoulders, protecting his body from the cold that cut like\r\nknives into his cheeks and forehead. The upper half of the bear's skull\r\ncovered his head and weighed heavily on it, as heavily as the awful fear\r\nof the vision quest weighed on his spirit.\r\n\r\nHis moccasins whispered over the fallen brown grass that covered the\r\ntrail. He had walked a long way, and his toes were numb in spite of the\r\nleaves stuffed into the moccasins.\r\n\r\nAbruptly the path stopped, and he was facing sky. He stood at the edge\r\nof the bluff looking eastward over the frozen Great River. He gripped\r\nthe deerhorn handle of his hunting knife.\r\n\r\nFor the feeling of strength it gave him, he slid the knife out of the\r\nsheath of hardened leather tied to his waist. The steel blade glistened,\r\ncolorless as the sky above him, in the fading light.\r\n\r\n_The knife my father left for me_, he thought. _Where are you tonight,\r\nmy father?_\r\n\r\nThe clouds seemed close enough to touch. They rippled like snowdrifts\r\npainted with light and shadow. Upriver the sky was darkened almost to\r\nblack, and Gray Cloud smelled snow in the air.\r\n\r\nHe saw the silhouette of a hawk, wing-tip feathers spread, circling over\r\nthe Illinois country across the river, hunting in the last moments\r\nbefore nightfall.\r\n\r\n_Hawk spirit, help me to live through this testing. Help me to see a\r\ngreat vision and grow to be a mighty shaman._\r\n\r\nThe tiny spot of black dwindled in the sky, till he could no longer see\r\nit.\r\n\r\n_Perhaps it flies over the winter silence of Saukenuk village._\r\n\r\nHe sheathed the knife. Turning his back on sky and river, he looked\r\nwestward over the way he had come. A prairie of waving tan grass almost\r\nas high as his head stretched as far as he could see. Killed by the\r\ncold, the grass yet stood, held up by the stiffness in its dead stalks.\r\nLike a fur cloak, the brown covered the hills that rolled away to the\r\nwest.\r\n\r\nHe could not see his people's winter hunting camp from here; it nestled\r\nback among those hills, sheltered in a forest that grew along the Ioway\r\nRiver. Looking in its direction, he saw Redbird in his mind. Her eyes,\r\nblack as obsidian arrowheads, shone at him. He felt a powerful yearning\r\njust to see her, to speak to her and hear her voice, to touch her cheek\r\nwith his fingertips. The thought that he might never see her again,\r\nnever go back to his people, chilled him more than the winter cold.\r\n\r\n_O Earthmaker, grant that I live to return to Redbird._\r\n\r\nHe knelt and peered over the edge of the bluff, the bearskin cloak\r\nbunching around him. Gray limestone, wrinkled and pitted like the face\r\nof an old man, swept down to dark masses of leafless shrubbery at the\r\nriver's edge. His eyes searched out and then found an especially black\r\nshadow in the bluff wall. If he had come any later on this day, he might\r\nnot have been able to find the cave mouth in the dark.\r\n\r\nThen he might have had to wait till morning. Or, trying to climb down to\r\nit, he might have missed the way and fallen to his death. A cold hollow\r\nswelled in his belly. It would be so easy to slip.\r\n\r\nEnough of what might have been. It was what would be that frightened him\r\nnow. He might die, not of falling, but of what he found in the cave.\r\n\r\nOr what found him.\r\n\r\nForcing that thought, too, out of his mind, he lowered his body over the\r\nedge of the bluff, dug his toes into footholds and carefully climbed\r\nsideways and downward. In places, the path along the bluff face widened\r\nout and was almost as easy to walk on as a forest trail. But then the\r\ncrumbling stone would slant steeply, so that he had to grip hard with\r\nhis buckskin-shod feet, feeling as if he were clinging to nothing at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nA wide ledge spread before the entrance to the sacred cave. He let out a\r\nbreath of deep relief as his feet stepped firmly on the flat stone.\r\n\r\nFrom outside he could see nothing of the cave. But when he entered, he\r\nfelt a sudden warmth, as if he were walking into a well-sealed lodge\r\nwith a bright fire going. He could smell old fires--and something else.\r\nAn animal smell that sent a ripple of cold through his bones. But not a\r\nfresh smell. He thanked Earthmaker for that, because he was sure it was\r\nthe smell of bear.\r\n\r\nBut Owl Carver had been using this cave for his vision quests for\r\nwinters beyond counting. And he had never spoken of a bear.\r\n\r\nGray Cloud stood uncertain in the entryway, letting his eyes adjust to\r\nthe darkness. He saw round, gleaming shapes clustered against the back\r\nwall, and a motionless figure about as high as a man's waist, with a\r\nsharply curved beak and spreading wings.\r\n\r\nAgain, seeing these things, he felt the coldness of fear. Now he saw\r\nthat the round objects on the floor were skulls, and he knew them for\r\nthe skulls of ancestors, great men and women of the tribe. Green and\r\nwhite stones that had long ago been necklaces glittered around the jaws\r\nof the great dead ones. And the winged figure standing over them was the\r\nOwl spirit, who guided the footsteps of the dead along the Trail of\r\nSouls. Owl Carver had earned his name by carving this statue of the\r\nspirit and setting it here.\r\n\r\nFrom a pouch tied to his belt Gray Cloud took a handful of sacred\r\ntobacco grains and sprinkled them on the cave floor as an offering.\r\n\r\nHe said, \"Give me leave to enter your cave, Fathers and Mothers. You\r\nknow me. I am your child.\"\r\n\r\nHe hesitated. Only through his mother, Sun Woman, was he the child of\r\nthese ancestors who guarded the sacred cave. His father was a pale eyes,\r\nand the pale eyes had no ancestors. Would the ancestors reject him?\r\n\r\nThere was no sign or sound from the skulls on the floor, but now he\r\ncould see farther into the shadows, and he saw that the cave went on\r\naround a bend, and that bend was guarded by another sacred figure. He\r\npeered at the shadowy figure for a moment and decided that it was a\r\nbear, but a bear such as he had never seen before. From head to foot\r\nthis bear was white. Owl Carver had said nothing about this statue.\r\n\r\nHe sighed in his dread, feeling a trembling in his stomach.\r\n\r\nIt was good for him to be here, he tried to tell himself. He had come\r\nhere to learn the shaman's secrets. This was the moment he had dreamed\r\nof ever since the first time he had seen Owl Carver, with his long white\r\nhair and his necklace of small shells of the lake-dwelling megis and his\r\nowl-crested cedar stick, step into the firelight. That long-ago night\r\nOwl Carver had spoken, not with the voice of a man, but with the voice\r\nof a spirit, an eerily high-pitched singsong that frightened and\r\nfascinated Gray Cloud.\r\n\r\nThe shaman of the tribe was greater than the bravest brave, greater than\r\nany chief. He had the power to heal the sick and to foretell the future.\r\nGray Cloud wanted to stand high among the Sauk and to go where the\r\nshaman went, into the spirit world. He wanted to penetrate the deepest\r\nmysteries and know the answer to every question.\r\n\r\nAfter he began teaching Gray Cloud, Owl Carver had tried to discourage\r\nhim--as a way of testing him, Gray Cloud was sure.\r\n\r\nOwl Carver had said, _Many times the people do not want to listen to the\r\nshaman. The truer his words, the less they hear him._\r\n\r\nThe warning had disturbed Gray Cloud. But he never saw the people refuse\r\nto listen to Owl Carver. And he did not lose his determination to become\r\na shaman himself.\r\n\r\nNo one could gain such a great reward without risk. A warrior must kill\r\nan enemy at great peril to himself to gain the right to wear the eagle\r\nfeather that marked him as a brave. A hunter had to kill an animal that\r\ncould kill him before the tribe would consider him a man.\r\n\r\nHow, then, could one speak to these spirits of the tribe unless he, too,\r\nhad faced death?\r\n\r\nBut what kind of a death? Would he freeze and starve here in this cave,\r\nhis dead body remaining until Owl Carver came and found it? Or would an\r\nevil spirit come and kill him?\r\n\r\nWhatever might come, he could only sit and wait for it in the way that\r\nOwl Carver had taught him.\r\n\r\nHe turned his back on the unknown depths of the cave and seated himself\r\nat its entrance, pulling the bearskin cloak around him for warmth. He\r\ndipped his fingers into a pouch at his belt and took out the bits of\r\ndried mushroom Owl Carver had given him from a medicine bag decorated\r\nwith a beadwork owl. The sacred mushrooms grew somewhere far to the\r\nsouth and were traded up the Great River. One by one he put them into\r\nhis mouth and slowly chewed them.\r\n\r\n_You do not need to swallow_, Owl Carver had said. _Hold them in your\r\nmouth until they slide down your throat without your knowing how it\r\nhappened._\r\n\r\nHis mouth grew dry as the mushrooms turned to paste. And it was as Owl\r\nCarver had said; they were gone without his knowing when they\r\ndisappeared into his body.\r\n\r\nHis stomach heaved once and he thought with terror that he might fail\r\nthis first small test. But he held his breath and slowly the sick\r\nfeeling died away.\r\n\r\nThe last light faded from the sky, and the far horizon across the river\r\nvanished. Blackness fell upon him like a blanket, thick, impenetrable.\r\nIt pressed against his face, suffocating him.\r\n\r\nThe notches in Owl Carver's talking stick, which the shaman had taught\r\nGray Cloud to count, said that tonight the full moon would rise. It\r\nwould make no difference. Gray Cloud would not see the moon in this sky\r\nfilled with clouds.\r\n\r\nA small spot of cold struck his face, then another and another. His nose\r\nand cheeks felt wet.\r\n\r\nSnow.\r\n\r\nThe snow would fall while he sat here, and he would freeze to death.\r\n\r\nHe must overcome his fear. He must enter the other world. There, Owl\r\nCarver had promised him, he would be safe. Without his spirit in his\r\nbody, he could not be hurt by the cold. But if fear kept him tied to\r\nthis world, the cold would kill him.\r\n\r\nHe heard something.\r\n\r\nA thumping and scraping behind him in the cave.\r\n\r\nSomething heavy shuffling around that bend. He felt his heart beating\r\nhard and fast in his chest.\r\n\r\nThere _was_ something in the cave. He had smelled it when he first\r\nentered. All the magic in the world could not save him now.\r\n\r\nHe heard breath being drawn through huge nostrils. Long, slow breaths of\r\na creature whose chest took a long time to fill with air. He heard a\r\ngrunting, low and determined.\r\n\r\nThe grunting changed to a rumbling growl that made the floor of the cave\r\ntremble beneath him.\r\n\r\nGray Cloud's breath came in gasps. He wanted to leap up and run, but Owl\r\nCarver had said it was forbidden to move once he seated himself in the\r\ncave. Only his spirit was permitted to move.\r\n\r\nPerhaps if he did everything exactly as Owl Carver had told him, he\r\nwould be safe. But Owl Carver had not told him to expect such a thing as\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nHe must not look up.\r\n\r\nThe scratching of those giant claws was right behind him now. He could\r\nnot breathe at all. There was a bright light all around him, and yet he\r\ncould not see anything.\r\n\r\nHe felt--\r\n\r\nA heavy hand--no, _paw!_--weighing down on his shoulder and gripping it.\r\n\r\nHe did not willingly turn his head, but his head turned. He did not mean\r\nto lift his gaze, but his eyes looked up.\r\n\r\nHe saw something like a vast white tree trunk beside his head. It was\r\ncovered with white fur. Claws gleamed on his shoulder.\r\n\r\nHe looked up. And up.\r\n\r\nAbove him, golden eyes blazing, black jaws open and white teeth\r\nglistening like spearpoints, towered a Bear.\r\n\r\nGray Cloud was in the presence of a spirit so mighty that his whole body\r\nseemed to dissolve in dread. He wanted to shrink into himself, bury his\r\nface in his arms. But he had no power over his limbs.\r\n\r\nThe Bear's paw on his shoulder lifted him, raising him to his feet.\r\nTogether they walked out of the cave.\r\n\r\nWhat had happened to the clouds and the snow?\r\n\r\nThe sky was full of stars that swept down to form a bridge ending at his\r\nfeet. The starlight cast a faint glow over the ice on the river, and he\r\ncould see the horizon and the opposite shore. Through the dusting of\r\ntiny sparkling lights, he saw the ledge outside the mouth of the sacred\r\ncave. Two steps forward and he would fall over the edge and be killed.\r\n\r\nThe White Bear, on all fours beside him now, seemed to be waiting for\r\nhim. Gray Cloud knew, somehow, what was expected of him. He must put his\r\nfeet on the bridge of stars and walk out over empty air. He could not do\r\nit. Terror clawed at his stomach as he thought of standing high above\r\nthe river with nothing to support him.\r\n\r\nThis, too, was a test. The bridge would be safe only if Gray Cloud\r\ntrusted it. From now on everything that happened to him would be a test.\r\nAnd if he did not master each one in turn, he would never be a shaman.\r\n\r\nAnd what would he be, then, if he lived? Only a half-breed boy, the son\r\nof a woman with no husband, the child of a missing father. The boy they\r\ncalled Gray Cloud because he was neither one color nor the other,\r\nneither white nor red.\r\n\r\nThis trail was the only way for him. He must walk on this bridge, and if\r\nhe fell and died, it would not matter.\r\n\r\nHe took the first step. For a terrifying moment his moccasin seemed to\r\nsink into the little sparks of light rather than rest upon them. But it\r\nwas as if the bridge were made of some springy substance, and the sole\r\nof his foot did not fall through it. He took another step. Now he had\r\nboth feet on the bridge. His heart was thundering, the blood roaring\r\nthrough his ears.\r\n\r\nHow could a bridge be made of nothing but light? How could a man stand\r\non it?\r\n\r\nOne more step forward. His leg shook so hard he could barely put his\r\nfoot down. His knees quivered. His body screamed at him to go back.\r\n\r\nAnother step, and this would be the hardest. Now he could see the abyss\r\nbelow him. He was out over it. He looked down, his whole body quaking.\r\nHe breathed in quick bursts, and saw little clouds in front of his face\r\nin the starlight.\r\n\r\nAnother step, and another. For balance, his trembling hands went out\r\nfrom his sides. He looked down. The river was solid ice, and the stars\r\nreflected on its smooth black surface. If he fell he would hit that ice\r\nso hard every one of his bones would break.\r\n\r\nHe teetered dizzily. He looked to the left and the right and saw that\r\nthe edges of the bridge were just on either side of him. He could topple\r\nover and nothing would stop him. Where was the White Bear?\r\n\r\nFear would make him fall. Even if this bridge of lights still held his\r\nweight, it was so narrow that he must surely lose his balance and die.\r\n\r\n_But if it holds me, I must be meant to live. And if I am meant to live,\r\nI will not be allowed to fall._\r\n\r\nIt was only his fear that was making the bridge feel so precarious. He\r\nknew that the more he believed, the safer it would be for him.\r\n\r\n_Never turn your back on fear_, he remembered Owl Carver saying. _Never\r\ntry to drive it away. Fear is your friend. It warns you of danger._\r\n\r\n_But what about when I must face the danger and not be warned from it?_\r\nhe asked.\r\n\r\n_As long as you listen to its warning, fear will not stop you from doing\r\nwhat you have to do. But if you try to pretend you do not hear it, fear\r\nwill trip you and bind you with rawhide cords._\r\n\r\nGray Cloud, still afraid, stepped forward more boldly. Whatever spirits\r\nwere making this happen to him, surely they were not showing him these\r\nwonders only then to destroy him.\r\n\r\nHe was out over the middle of the river, and he heard a deep muttering\r\nbehind him.\r\n\r\nHe turned, and it was the White Bear, as big as an old bull buffalo,\r\nmoving with him on its huge, clawed feet. It came up beside him, and he\r\nreached up to touch its shoulder. He knew now that it was a great\r\nspirit, and that it was his friend. He dug his fingers into the thick\r\nfur and felt the warmth and the enormous, powerful muscle underneath.\r\n\r\nJoy flooded through him. Where he had been nearly overcome with fear,\r\nstrength and excitement had entered. He ran up the rising curve of the\r\nbridge. He felt an impulse to dance, and he broke into the half trot,\r\nhalf shuffle of the men when they welcomed the harvest of good things to\r\neat that the women had planted around Saukenuk village. He flapped his\r\narms like the wild goose.\r\n\r\nThe bridge, he saw now, did not cross the river, but followed it. He\r\nlooked up. The trail of stars ended at the one star in the sky that, as\r\nOwl Carver had pointed out to him, remained fixed when all the other\r\nstars danced around it. And therefore it was called the Council Fire\r\nStar.\r\n\r\nThe little lights twinkled all around him, like flocks of bright birds,\r\nand his heart was full of happiness. It was all so beautiful, he wanted\r\nto sing.\r\n\r\nAnd he did sing, the only song he knew that seemed right for this\r\nmoment, the Song of Creation.\r\n\r\n    \"Earthmaker, you fill the world with life.\r\n    You put life in earth and sky and water.\r\n    I do not know what you are, Earthmaker,\r\n    But you are in me and everything that lives.\r\n    Always you have dwelt in life,\r\n    Always you will dwell so.\"\r\n\r\nHe sang and danced and the White Bear rose up on its hind legs and\r\nstrode heavily along beside him.\r\n\r\nThe light from the Council Fire Star grew brighter and seemed to dispel\r\nthe blackness of the sky around it. The star grew until it was a sphere\r\nof cold fire that filled the sky.\r\n\r\nHe heard a roaring sound and saw that from the bottom of the shining\r\nglobe water was pouring. The water gave off a light of its own. His eye\r\nfollowed its plunge. He was far, far above the earth now. The Great\r\nRiver was a shiny black ribbon, barely visible, winding over the earth.\r\nStraight as a spear the water from the Council Fire Star was falling\r\ndown to the place where the Great River began its winding course.\r\n\r\nHe exulted. Already he had learned a secret no other Sauk knew, unless\r\nit be Owl Carver himself--the true source of the Great River.\r\n\r\nHe saw a square, dark opening in the glowing surface of the star. The\r\npath led to it. Still walking on its hind legs, the White Bear pressed\r\ninexorably on toward that doorway, and Gray Cloud walked beside it.\r\n\r\nThe colors of the rainbow shimmered in the light from the star, and it\r\npulsed faintly like a beating heart. When he thought of what a mighty\r\nspirit must dwell in this magnificent lodge--perhaps Earthmaker\r\nhimself--Gray Cloud's heart was once again full of fear.\r\n\r\nHe trembled and his steps slowed. He could not come face to face with\r\nsuch a being. It would be like staring into the sun. His eyes would be\r\nburned out of his head. He felt himself weakening.\r\n\r\nThe star-studded surface under his feet shook a little. He took a step\r\nand it quivered under his footfall. The White Bear was ahead of him now,\r\nleaving him out here alone among the stars, high above the earth on a\r\nbridge that was beginning to fall apart.\r\n\r\nHe looked back over the way he had come.\r\n\r\nThere was no bridge behind him.\r\n\r\nNothing but a blackness. He screamed, waved his arms, staggered.\r\n\r\nHe started to run forward after the Bear, his only protector, and his\r\nfeet were sinking _into_ the bridge. The Bear and the doorway and the\r\nCouncil Fire Star itself seemed farther and farther away.\r\n\r\nHe fell to his hands and knees, afraid to stand any more.\r\n\r\nBut what was the fear trying to tell him?\r\n\r\nIt was right that Gray Cloud should be afraid, meeting a spirit so much\r\nmore powerful than himself. And now he must trust that the spirit would\r\nnot hurt him.\r\n\r\nWith that thought, he felt the bridge growing more solid under his\r\nhands. He pushed himself back to his feet.\r\n\r\nHe was standing before the doorway. All above him and to the sides\r\nstretched the curving, shimmering, many-colored surface of the Council\r\nFire Star.\r\n\r\nHe did not see the White Bear. It must have gone into the star. He took\r\na deep breath, and taking his fear with him, he plunged through the\r\ndoorway.\r\n\r\nFor a moment light blinded him. The air was full of a fluttering and a\r\nrustling.\r\n\r\nHis eyes grew used to the light and he saw that he stood at the edge of\r\na pool full of fish swimming in circles.\r\n\r\nThey were not fish, he knew, but fish spirits. The spirits of trout and\r\nsalmon and bass and walleye and sunfish and pike, all the fish of lakes\r\nand streams that fed his people.\r\n\r\nFull of fear of what else he might see, Gray Cloud raised his eyes.\r\n\r\nHe saw a Turtle.\r\n\r\nThe Turtle was frightfully big. He was on the other side of the rushing\r\npool, but still he loomed over Gray Cloud, his head high in the air. His\r\nfront feet rested on a blue-white block of ice. Behind him rose a\r\nmountain of ice crystals. The wrinkles around his eyes and mouth told\r\nGray Cloud he was immeasurably old.\r\n\r\n\"Gray Cloud,\" the Turtle said. \"You are welcome here.\" His voice was\r\ndeep as thunder.\r\n\r\nGray Cloud fell again to his hands and knees.\r\n\r\n\"Do not be afraid, Gray Cloud,\" said the rumbling voice.\r\n\r\nHe looked up again and saw kindness in the enormous, heavy-lidded yellow\r\neyes. The exposed belly of the Turtle was the pale green of spring\r\nleaves. On his bone-encased chest a bright drop of water formed, like a\r\ndewdrop or a teardrop, but big as a man's head. After a moment it fell\r\nand splashed into the pool. Gray Cloud looked into the bottom of the\r\npool and saw the blackness of a deep pit in its center. He realized that\r\nit must be from this pool that the stream of water poured down into the\r\nGreat River. And the drops of water falling from the Turtle fed the\r\npool. The true source of the Great River was the Turtle spirit's heart.\r\n\r\nOwl Carver had told him of the Turtle. After Earthmaker he was the\r\noldest and most powerful spirit. He had helped to create the world and\r\nto keep it alive.\r\n\r\nScarcely able to believe that he was actually looking upon the Turtle,\r\nGray Cloud lifted his gaze and saw that all manner of beasts and birds\r\noccupied the ledges on the ice-crystal mountain. All creation was here.\r\nTrees--maple, ash, elm, oak, hickory, birch, pine and spruce--clustered\r\non the mountainside, roots somehow drawing nourishment from the ice.\r\n\r\nHe said, \"Father, I thank you for letting me come here.\"\r\n\r\nInstead of answering him, the huge reptilian head swung to one side. He\r\nfollowed the gaze of the yellow eye.\r\n\r\nA man was standing near the Turtle's head on one of the ledges. He was\r\ntall and thin. His eyes were round and blue, his face white. A pale\r\neyes! What would a pale eyes be doing here in the lodge of the Turtle?\r\nThe man had long black hair streaked with gray, tied at the back of his\r\nhead. His thin figure was dressed in a blue coat, pinched at the waist\r\nby a black leather belt with a sword and a pistol hanging from it. His\r\nwhite trousers were tucked into shiny black boots that came up to his\r\ncalves. Seeing the sword, Gray Cloud thought this man must be one of the\r\nlong knives, the dreaded pale eyes warriors.\r\n\r\nThe man was looking at Gray Cloud. His face was narrow, with deep lines.\r\nAll the pale eyes Gray Cloud had seen had hairy faces--thick mustaches\r\ngrowing under their noses, and sometimes beards that spread out over\r\ntheir chests--but this man's face was clean. His nose was large and\r\nhooked like a hawk's beak. Gray Cloud saw that the man was weeping.\r\nTears were running down his creased cheeks as he stared at Gray Cloud.\r\nThe look in those blue eyes, Gray Cloud realized, was not sadness, but\r\nlove.\r\n\r\nReturning the man's gaze, Gray Cloud felt a warmth in his own chest like\r\nthe heat suddenly rising from a fire that has taken hold.\r\n\r\n\"I have brought you to hear a warning,\" said the Turtle, his voice\r\nshaking Gray Cloud's very bones. \"You must carry my words back to my\r\nchildren, the Sauk and Fox.\" As the Turtle spoke, another huge drop\r\nsplashed into the pool, to add itself to the Great River.\r\n\r\n\"Evil days are coming for my children.\"\r\n\r\nGray Cloud quailed, thinking that he did not want to bring that back to\r\nhis people. But perhaps there was some good word he could tell them.\r\n\r\n\"How may we escape this evil, Father Turtle?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"This evil is from the pale eyes.\"\r\n\r\nAt this, Gray Cloud turned to stare at the pale eyes man, who looked sad\r\nnow, even sombre. Who was this man, and why was he here?\r\n\r\n\"The pale eyes and my children cannot live on the same land,\" said the\r\nTurtle. \"Because they do not live in the same way. Most pale eyes do not\r\nwish harm to my children, but they do harm by coming into the land where\r\nmy children dwell.\"\r\n\r\nGray Cloud at once grasped what the Turtle spoke of. Generations of Sauk\r\nand their allies, the Fox, had lived in towns at the joining of the Rock\r\nRiver and the Great River, where in summer they raised corn, beans,\r\nsquash and pumpkins. Each fall they would leave their towns and fields\r\nfor winter hunting camps in the West. But the pale eyes warriors, the\r\nlong knives, had been telling the Sauk and Fox that they must give up\r\nall their land on the east side of the Great River, even their principal\r\ntown, Saukenuk, and move forever west, into the Ioway country. And the\r\nwar chief Black Hawk had defied the long knives, leading his people each\r\nspring back across the river to farm the land around Saukenuk.\r\n\r\nGray Cloud knew that even the kindliest pale eyes were not to be\r\ntrusted. Owl Carver was suspicious of the black-robed medicine man, Père\r\nIsaac, who talked about the spirit called Jesus and who spent many\r\nafternoons with Gray Cloud, teaching him the words and signs of the\r\nAmerican pale eyes.\r\n\r\nThe Turtle's voice broke in upon these memories. \"Tell my children that\r\na great clash is to come between them and the long knives. The people\r\nwill suffer, and many of them will die.\"\r\n\r\nGray Cloud gasped as the horror of that sank in. He looked again at the\r\npale eyes, and now where there had been love he saw lines of sorrow\r\ncarved deep into the thin face.\r\n\r\n_Is this man, then, a danger to me?_\r\n\r\n\"Is there no escape, Father Turtle?\" he asked again.\r\n\r\n\"The people must walk their path with courage,\" said the Turtle. \"Black\r\nHawk will lead them. And he and his braves will show the greatest\r\ncourage, such courage that the name of Black Hawk will never be\r\nforgotten in the land where he was born.\"\r\n\r\nThe Turtle's golden, heavy-lidded eye seemed to fix itself on Gray\r\nCloud.\r\n\r\n\"And you will find your own path. For some of the people the path you\r\nfind will be good. But many others will journey in sorrow into the\r\nsetting sun. And there they will disappear forever.\"\r\n\r\nBewildered, Gray Cloud looked from the Turtle to the pale eyes near him\r\nand back to the Turtle again. These things the Turtle had said were\r\nstrange, like the words Owl Carver would chant before the council fire.\r\nMust he bring his people a message of suffering and sorrow? Would they\r\nlisten?\r\n\r\nHe wanted to ask more questions but he felt a gentle pressure from the\r\ngreat body of the Bear beside him, and he knew that his visit to the\r\nlodge of the Turtle was ended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nThe Spirit Bear\r\n\r\n\r\nRedbird stood at the edge of the hunting camp, beside the grove of trees\r\nwhere the band's horses were sheltering from the falling snow. Her tears\r\nmingled with the snowflakes melting on her face. Wherever she looked, a\r\nwhite curtain hid the land.\r\n\r\nWould Gray Cloud die? The thought made her heart feel as if a giant's\r\nfist was squeezing it. Yesterday, at midday, her father had sent Gray\r\nCloud on his vision quest, and in the most dangerous time of the year,\r\nthe Moon of Ice, when the spirits harvested the living, leaving only the\r\nstrongest to survive through to the spring. And just as night fell, the\r\nsnow had begun. Would the spirits take Gray Cloud?\r\n\r\nTears burned her eyes and she felt dizzy. She had not slept all last\r\nnight, and she had waited and watched through the day.\r\n\r\nAs she stood looking eastward, where Gray Cloud had gone on his spirit\r\njourney, it came to her that he might already be dead. The wind must\r\nhave been blowing snow into the sacred cave all night and all day. Gray\r\nCloud, in a trance, might already have frozen to death. She might be\r\nweeping for a dead man.\r\n\r\nShe sobbed aloud and put her hands, in squirrelskin mittens, to her\r\nface. The snow on the mittens felt barely colder than her cheeks.\r\n\r\nA flash of light, brighter than the sun, blinded her. A tremendous roar\r\nof thunder almost knocked her to the snow-covered ground. Another bright\r\nflash made her cover her eyes in dismay, and in a moment there was\r\nanother long, rolling, earth-shaking rumble.\r\n\r\nPeople stood at the doorways of their dome-shaped wickiups, murmuring\r\nto one another. Thunder with a snowstorm. This was the heaviest\r\nsnowstorm of the year so far, and a snowstorm with thunder and lightning\r\nforetold some great event. Much snow lay on the rounded roofs of the\r\nwickiups, and some women took whisks of bundled twigs to brush it away\r\nso that it would not break down the framework of poles or melt through\r\nthe roofs of elm bark and cattail mats and wet the people inside and\r\ntheir possessions. The snow was dry and powdery because the air was so\r\ncold, and it brushed away easily.\r\n\r\nThe snow was already halfway up Redbird's laced deerskin boots. She felt\r\nthe bitter cold numbing her feet and legs. What must it be like for Gray\r\nCloud?\r\n\r\nShe saw him as vividly as if he were standing before her. How very tall\r\nhe was, almost as tall as her brother, Iron Knife. But Gray Cloud's\r\nframe was slender, not broad and powerful like Iron Knife's.\r\n\r\nShe saw Gray Cloud's tender mouth curving in a tentative smile, his\r\nsharp nose giving strength to his face, his large eyes glowing. His skin\r\nso much lighter than any other man's in the British Band of the Sauk and\r\nFox.\r\n\r\nAnd--she asked herself--was it not partly because of the mystery of Gray\r\nCloud's father that she found herself drawn to him? Pale eyes fascinated\r\nher, the few she had met, Jean de Vilbiss the trader, the black-robed\r\nmedicine man called Père Isaac.\r\n\r\nEvery summer, when Père Isaac visited Saukenuk village, he took Gray\r\nCloud aside, teaching him strange words, showing him how to understand\r\nthe meaning of marks on paper and how to make such marks. How she envied\r\nGray Cloud, and wished that Père Isaac would teach her those things,\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\nRedbird wondered why pale eyes were so different and why they had so\r\nmuch power. No Sauk craftsman could make anything like the steel swords\r\nthat pale eyes warriors carried, whence they were called long knives.\r\nThe steel tomahawks that the pale eyes traded for furs could shatter a\r\nstone-headed Sauk tomahawk into fragments. A pale eyes fire weapon, of\r\ncourse, was something every warrior of the Sauk and Fox tribes yearned\r\nfor.\r\n\r\nBut what interested Redbird most were the steel sewing needles and iron\r\ncooking pots and calico dresses and wool blankets. She wondered why\r\nEarthmaker had given the knowledge of how to make such things to the\r\npale eyes, but not to the Sauk and Fox. Her people wore the skins of\r\nanimals, scraped and pushed and pulled and tanned with the animals'\r\nbrains and women's urine until they were soft and pliant and could be\r\nworn comfortably next to the skin. But the clothing of the pale eyes was\r\nmore comfortable, and easier to keep clean. And more colorful. Sauk and\r\nFox shirts and leggings and skirts, unless painted or decorated with\r\ndyed quills, were usually the brown or tan of animal skins. The best\r\ndeerskin garments were worked till they were white. The dresses and\r\nshawls and blankets the pale eyes traders offered were of many\r\ncolors--blue and yellow, red and green, with flowers and other pictures\r\nand designs on them. Redbird often spent long moments staring at the\r\ngood calico dress her father, Owl Carver, had gotten for her from the\r\npale eyes traders, just delighting in the tiny red roses printed on its\r\npale blue background.\r\n\r\nFor a moment, lost in thought about the pale eyes, she had forgotten\r\nGray Cloud's danger and her own pain. Now it came back to her like a war\r\nclub crushing her chest.\r\n\r\nSoon it would be night again. Gray Cloud had been in the cave a whole\r\nnight and a whole day, while the snow fell. And the snow was falling\r\nstill. If someone did not rescue him, he would surely die.\r\n\r\nShe would go to her father, Owl Carver, and demand that Gray Cloud be\r\nbrought back from the sacred cave.\r\n\r\nShe turned and pushed her feet through the fresh snow, hurrying past the\r\nround-roofed, snow-covered wickiups of the British Band's winter camp in\r\nIoway country. A dog burst out of Wolf Paw's doorway and floundered\r\nthrough the snow, its short pointed ears flattened, barking at her. Wolf\r\nPaw's dogs were a nuisance, barking and snapping at anyone who passed\r\nnear his dwelling.\r\n\r\nThe dog stopped barking, and she heard footsteps squeaking in the snow.\r\nShe stopped and turned. Wolf Paw himself was standing before his wickiup\r\nbeside the tall pole from whose top hung six Sioux scalps he had taken\r\nlast winter.\r\n\r\nWolf Paw glowered at her, arms folded under a bright red blanket. Three\r\nshort black stripes near one edge were the pale eyes trader's guarantee\r\nthat the blanket was of highest quality. Despite the snow, Wolf Paw's\r\nhead was uncovered, all shaved except for the stiff-standing crest of\r\nred-dyed deer hair in the middle. Three black and white eagle feathers\r\nwere tied into it.\r\n\r\nRedbird did not like Wolf Paw. He never let people forget that he was\r\nthe son of the great war chief Black Hawk, whose wickiup lay only a\r\nshort distance from his own. He never smiled, and she knew very well\r\nwhat he was thinking when he looked at her.\r\n\r\nShe turned without a greeting and walked on, kicking the snow as she\r\nwent. But the sight of Wolf Paw had reminded her that though Owl Carver\r\nwas her father, she still had only a woman's influence. The spirit\r\njourney of Gray Cloud was a matter for men.\r\n\r\nOwl Carver loved her and was good to her, but if she tried to interfere\r\nin his holy calling, he would be furious. He would never agree to bring\r\nGray Cloud down from the cave before he came down on his own. Such a\r\nthing was against the way of the shaman.\r\n\r\nShe was still wondering what she dared say when she came to her family's\r\nwickiup and found Owl Carver standing beside it, hands clasped behind\r\nhis back, staring eastward toward the Great River.\r\n\r\nAs she shuffled through the snow toward him, he turned and held out his\r\nhands. When she reached him, he put his hands on her shoulders. She\r\npeered into his face, hard to see now that night had fallen, and tried\r\nto read it.\r\n\r\nOwl Carver's face was flat. His long white hair was bound at his\r\nforehead with a beaded band and fell from there to his shoulders,\r\nspreading like a white shawl. His necklace of little round, striped\r\nshells of the water creatures called megis rattled in the wind.\r\n\r\nShe trembled inwardly in his presence. The shaman of the tribe could\r\nboth heal and kill.\r\n\r\n\"How can he live in this blizzard?\" she said, almost weeping.\r\n\r\n\"Did you not see the lightning, my daughter, and hear the thunder? Do\r\nyou think that merely betokens a young man freezing to death? Hear\r\nme--once in a thousand years a man comes among us who is capable of\r\nbeing a Great Shaman. Of being to other shamans, like myself, what\r\nEarthmaker is to the lesser spirits of beasts and birds. But to be\r\nknown, and to discover the greatness of his powers, such a man must be\r\nas greatly tested. I saw in Gray Cloud a man beyond the ordinary.\"\r\n\r\nOwl Carver's willingness to talk made Redbird feel bolder. \"Surely Gray\r\nCloud has been in the sacred cave long enough, my father. Will you not\r\ngo now and bring him down?\"\r\n\r\nHe pushed her away, staring at her. \"Earthmaker decides what is enough.\r\nA man must _suffer_ to be worthy of the power his spirit guide bestows\r\non him. When I first began to walk the shaman's path, I wandered far\r\naway into the great desert of the West and nearly died of hunger and\r\nthirst. I did not suffer as much as Gray Cloud is suffering. But that is\r\nbecause he can be a much greater shaman than I, if he lives. If he does\r\nnot live, he is like a foal born lame in the springtime. The wolves must\r\nget him. It is Earthmaker's way.\"\r\n\r\nFrightened though she was, Redbird forced herself to speak up. \"There is\r\nsuffering that even the strongest cannot bear.\"\r\n\r\nOwl Carver took a step toward her, his eyes round with anger. \"Remember\r\nwhat the law of the Sauk and Fox decrees for anyone who disturbs a man\r\non a spirit journey, even to help him. They take you to the Great River.\r\nIn the summer they would throw you in with rocks tied to you. In this\r\nseason they chop a hole in the ice and they push you in. The current\r\nflows swiftly under the ice. It carries you away from the opening, and\r\nyou drown there in the cold and dark.\"\r\n\r\nRedbird shrank back. Owl Carver had felt her pain when she first came to\r\nhim, but now he was angry. She sensed that behind that anger there\r\nlurked fear. Fear that she might risk her life for Gray Cloud.\r\n\r\n\"Your mother has been calling for you,\" he said. \"Go and help her with\r\nher work.\"\r\n\r\nAfraid to say any more, Redbird hurried past him and lifted the heavy\r\nbuffalo skin that covered the doorway of the family's wickiup. She\r\nlooked over her shoulder once and saw that her father was once again\r\nlooking toward the river where Gray Cloud had gone. Owl Carver held his\r\nhands behind his back, knotting them together.\r\n\r\nHe was afraid for Gray Cloud, too. As she sensed that, her heart sank\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\nEntering the wickiup she saw, silhouetted against the light of the low\r\nfire in the center, a figure rising up big as a buffalo, her half\r\nbrother, Iron Knife. Redbird took his hands in greeting.\r\n\r\n\"Gray Cloud will be well,\" Iron Knife said in a low, gruff voice.\r\n\r\nIron Knife was always kind to her. She was grateful for his words, but\r\nshe knew they were no more than a well-meant wish. Though Iron Knife was\r\nthe son of Owl Carver by his first wife, he had not a trace of the\r\nshaman's ability to foretell events. Iron Knife could see only with his\r\neyes, hear only with his ears. His mother had died giving birth to him,\r\nand there were those who said the spirits had chosen to give him no\r\ngifts because he had killed his mother. Redbird had even heard that\r\nwhile in mourning Owl Carver had predicted that Iron Knife would one day\r\nbe killed by a man whose mother had also died giving birth to him. No\r\none dared speak of these things in Iron Knife's presence.\r\n\r\nRedbird knew she had more of the shaman in her than Iron Knife. She\r\nknew, as her father did, that right now Gray Cloud was in terrible\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\n\"Where have you been?\" Wind Bends Grass called out from the shadows. She\r\nand Redbird's sisters were already bedded down for the night on\r\nbuffalo-robe pallets along the wall of the wickiup. Wind Bends Grass and\r\nher two little girls, Wild Grape and Robin's Nest, slept together for\r\ngreater warmth.\r\n\r\n\"I was down in the woods, seeing to our horses,\" Redbird lied. She had\r\nbeen near the horses, but only to watch for Gray Cloud.\r\n\r\n\"I needed you here,\" Wind Bends Grass said crossly. \"I was stringing\r\nbeads for a new sash for your father, and your sisters are too small to\r\nhelp me.\"\r\n\r\n_Does my mother want me to string beads while Gray Cloud freezes to\r\ndeath?_\r\n\r\n\"The snow was heavy on the horses' backs,\" Redbird said. \"They needed\r\nsomeone to brush them off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense,\" said Wind Bends Grass, sitting up. \"You were waiting and\r\nworrying for that pale eyes boy. And meanwhile Wolf Paw came again to\r\nspeak to your father today. How can you refuse the son of the mighty\r\nBlack Hawk and think of marrying that boy who has no father? His mother\r\nlay with a pale eyes and got Gray Cloud. The pale eyes lived with her\r\nonly five summers and then ran away. He would have run away sooner, but\r\nour people held him prisoner because of the war.\"\r\n\r\nRedbird heard muffled giggles from the bedding beside her mother. Her\r\nlittle sisters thought the story of Gray Cloud's parentage funny. Wind\r\nBends Grass struck with her hand at the two shaking bundles.\r\n\r\n\"Wolf Paw already has a wife,\" Redbird said.\r\n\r\n\"He is a _man_,\" said Wind Bends Grass. \"A brave. He can make two wives,\r\nthree wives, _four_ wives happy.\"\r\n\r\nRage at her mother for belittling Gray Cloud when he might be dying\r\nboiled up inside her and almost choked her. She bit her lip and held\r\nback the angry words. She hurt too much to want to quarrel.\r\n\r\nShe took off her fur cap, wet boots and mittens and laid them near the\r\nfire. Keeping on her buffalo-hide cloak, her doeskin dress and leggings,\r\nshe lay down on her own pallet, padded with blankets and prairie grass.\r\nCurling up her legs, she wrapped the heavy cloak around herself.\r\n\r\nThe wickiup was quiet, except for the popping of burning twigs.\r\n\r\nRedbird knew that her fear for Gray Cloud, deepening as the night\r\ndeepened, would keep her awake. She decided that when they were all\r\nasleep, she would go back to the wickiup of Sun Woman and watch with\r\nher.\r\n\r\nShe lay staring at the blackened ceiling that arched over her head.\r\nPartly obscured by drifting smoke, the curved poles cast deep shadows in\r\nthe flickering light. Iron Knife had laid fresh branches on the fire.\r\nSmoke stung her eyes.\r\n\r\nSometimes she thought she saw spirit messages above her in the patterns\r\nof the twigs interwoven with the larger poles, and in the cracks in the\r\nsheets of bark that lined the inside of the wickiup. But tonight her\r\nmind was too absorbed in Gray Cloud's fate to try to read the patterns.\r\n\r\nOver the breathing of the others she could hear the voice of the wind\r\nhumming across the roof. From time to time it would rise to a howl, and\r\nthe framework of the wickiup would creak and crackle under the strain.\r\nEven though there was a fire and the wickiup was tightly sealed, Redbird\r\nfelt the cold seeping up from the earth. Its icy fingers touched her\r\nbody through the buffalo robe. Her dread for Gray Cloud turned to\r\nheart-pounding panic.\r\n\r\n_If I feel the cold, here in my warm wickiup, what must it be like for\r\nhim?_\r\n\r\nAfter the snow stopped falling, the cold of this night would be the cold\r\nthat killed without mercy. Such a deepening cold often seemed to follow\r\na great snow. After a night like this, women would find rabbit and deer\r\nlying in the drifts near the camp. The animals trying to get close to\r\nwarmth had overcome their fear of people, but the cold had leeched the\r\nlife from their bodies. Even the strongest animals might die. Only\r\npeople, to whom Earthmaker had given the knowledge of how to shelter\r\nthemselves and make fire, could withstand this death-dealing cold.\r\n\r\nHer fists clenched on the blanket. Her heart filled up with anger. Anger\r\nagainst the cold, against her mother, who despised Gray Cloud, against\r\nOwl Carver, who had sent him to almost certain death. Against the\r\nspirits, who had permitted this. Out of her anger blazed up a fierce\r\nresolve.\r\n\r\n_I will not let you take him from me._\r\n\r\nIf everyone else accepted Gray Cloud's death, she did not. She would go\r\nto him. She would go to Sun Woman and gather what medicines she might\r\nhave, anything that would keep the cold from draining the last bit of\r\nwarmth and strength out of Gray Cloud.\r\n\r\n_Have you not been told what the tribe decrees for anyone who disturbs a\r\nman on a spirit journey, even to help him?_\r\n\r\nHer anger turned to fear, and she lay there, not wanting to move,\r\nknowing that if she threw off the blankets and stood up, she would be\r\ntaking the first step on a path that might be her death.\r\n\r\nBut then she thought of that terrible wind, sharp as a pale eyes' steel\r\nknife, shrieking around Gray Cloud's body. If she did something now, he\r\nmight live; and if she did nothing, he was sure to die.\r\n\r\nShe had loved Gray Cloud for as long as she could remember. To be\r\nwithout him--she could not bear to think of it.\r\n\r\nShe had heard tales of women who died fighting beside their men. Yes,\r\nbetter to die with Gray Cloud, to walk the Trail of Souls into the West\r\nwith him, than live a long life grieving for him.\r\n\r\nShe listened to the sounds of the sleepers, Iron Knife's rumbling snore,\r\nWind Bends Grass's heavy breathing that sounded like her name, the\r\nrustlings and murmurings of Wild Grape and Robin's Nest.\r\n\r\nOwl Carver still had not come in, and he might stay out there most of\r\nthe night. She dared not wait any longer. She would have to face him.\r\n\r\nSilently she pushed off her coverings and stood up. She quickly put back\r\non her fur cap, boots and mittens.\r\n\r\nThe deepened cold bit into her cheeks like a weasel's teeth. While she\r\nhad lain in the wickiup the snow, which had been falling continually for\r\na night and a day, had stopped at last. The clouds overhead were\r\nbreaking up, and she could see the full moon, round and bright as a pale\r\neyes' silver coin. The Moon of Ice. It seemed frozen in place in the\r\nblack sky. Stars glittered, little chips of ice. With her first indrawn\r\nbreath the insides of her nostrils seemed to freeze, the air burned in\r\nher nose and throat. Her heart quailed for Gray Cloud.\r\n\r\nThe black figure of Owl Carver stood just where she had left him. How\r\ncould he stand the cold this long?\r\n\r\nOwl Carver turned to her. \"Where are you going?\"\r\n\r\n\"To Sun Woman's wickiup, to watch with her.\"\r\n\r\nShe hated Owl Carver. He was the one who had sent Gray Cloud on this\r\nspirit journey, and now would do nothing to save him from death.\r\n\r\nAs if sensing her agony, he said, \"The spirits will watch over Gray\r\nCloud.\"\r\n\r\nShe wanted to believe him, but she could not. She had begged him to help\r\nGray Cloud, and he had commanded her to be silent. Now she had no more\r\nto say to him. She turned from Owl Carver.\r\n\r\nHe could have forbidden her to go to Sun Woman. But he would not do\r\nthat. There was an understanding between Redbird and her father that she\r\ncould not put into words. She knew that when he looked at her, he was\r\ntorn between pride that she, the oldest of his children by Wind Bends\r\nGrass, possessed the same gifts he did, and sorrow that she was a woman,\r\nand could never be a shaman. And she knew that of all his children, he\r\nloved her best.\r\n\r\nThe snow, blown off the roofs of the wickiups, piled up in long drifts\r\non their western sides. The east wind battered Redbird as she plodded\r\nthrough the winter camp toward one low, rounded black structure that\r\nrose out of the snow a bit apart from the others, on the north side of\r\nthe camp.\r\n\r\nThe skinned quarters of small animals hung frozen from a rack outside\r\nSun Woman's doorway. Redbird went up to the flap of buffalo hide and\r\ncalled, \"It is Redbird. May I come in?\"\r\n\r\nRedbird heard Sun Woman undoing the sinew laces that held the flap down.\r\nShe bent and entered.\r\n\r\nIn the firelight within Sun Woman's wickiup, Redbird saw agony in the\r\ntightness of the older woman's wide mouth and the clenching of her\r\nstrong jaw. Gray Cloud's mother was built big, with broad shoulders and\r\nhips and large hands, but there was a helplessness now in the way she\r\nstood staring into the fire. Hanging from the curving bark wall behind\r\nher were her craft objects, a medicine bundle of deerskin, the carved\r\nfigures of a naked man and a naked woman, clamshells to mold maple\r\nsugar, a horse's tail dyed red, a small drum and a flute.\r\n\r\nRedbird spoke in a rush. \"If he dies I do not want to live.\" She feared\r\nthat if she tried to address Sun Woman properly, her voice would be\r\nchoked by sobs before she could say what demanded to be said.\r\n\r\nShe should not even suggest to Gray Cloud's mother that he might die.\r\nAnd she should not even hint to his mother of her love for Gray Cloud,\r\nwhen neither Sun Woman nor Owl Carver had spoken to each other of plans\r\nfor their children. The band would be appalled at such rudeness.\r\n\r\n\"Forgive me for speaking so to you,\" she said timidly.\r\n\r\nSun Woman smiled, but Redbird saw that there was much sadness in the\r\nsmile. \"You know you can.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you are different,\" Redbird said.\r\n\r\n_Even though the pale eyes killed your husband, you took a pale eyes\r\ninto your wickiup._\r\n\r\nThis had happened more than fifteen winters ago, and Redbird knew it\r\nonly as a story that her mother and other women liked to repeat while\r\nthey did their work together. Sun Woman's husband, a brave named Dark\r\nWater, had been killed in a quarrel with pale eyes settlers. In spite of\r\nthat, when Gray Cloud's pale eyes father came to live with the Sauk, Sun\r\nWoman had come to love him.\r\n\r\n\"I am different, too,\" said Redbird. She wondered if Sun Woman knew how\r\ndifferent she was. Most women lived from season to season, while Redbird\r\nsometimes thought about what the tribe might be doing, where they might\r\nbe, ten summers from now.\r\n\r\nOnly two kinds of people thought the kind of long thoughts that came\r\noften to Redbird--chiefs and shamans. She sometimes imagined what it\r\nwould be like to be a shaman. To live in accord with the gift Earthmaker\r\ngave her. She thought so often about it that it became a longing within\r\nher, even though she knew that such a thing could not be.\r\n\r\nThis, Redbird thought, was the most she could hope for--to become a\r\nmedicine woman, like Gray Cloud's mother. A medicine woman had an\r\nimportant place in the band, but she was not listened to, as the shaman\r\nwas.\r\n\r\nSun Woman reached out and laid her bare hand on top of Redbird's, which\r\nwas still in a mitten. \"That is why I would be pleased if you and my son\r\nshared a wickiup.\"\r\n\r\nRedbird was startled and, amidst her fear and grief for Gray Cloud,\r\ndelighted. Truly, no mother ever spoke like this before words between\r\nparents had been exchanged. And to know that Sun Woman would accept her\r\nas her son's wife--wondrous!\r\n\r\nBut Gray Cloud might already be dead. \"How can we talk and smile so?\"\r\nshe cried. \"He is up in the sacred cave, and the snow fell all last\r\nnight and all day today.\"\r\n\r\nSun Woman shook her head. \"When I gave the boy to Owl Carver, I gave up\r\nthe right to say what was to be done with him. Like Owl Carver, Gray\r\nCloud belongs to the spirits now.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the spirits--\" Redbird waved her hands helplessly. \"They protect as\r\nthey like and they let death strike as they like.\"\r\n\r\nA shadow of pain crossed Sun Woman's face. \"Do you say such things to\r\nhurt me?\"\r\n\r\nRedbird was shocked. \"No!\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think I feel no pain?\"\r\n\r\nRedbird felt tears filling her eyes, burning them. She wiped her face.\r\n\"I know you do.\"\r\n\r\nSun Woman brought her face closer to Redbird's, took Redbird's chin in\r\nher hand, and said, \"I do not show pain because I do not want to make\r\nothers suffer with me. But you know what I feel.\"\r\n\r\nSun Woman opened her arms, and Redbird pressed her body against the\r\nbigger, older woman's. She felt Sun Woman's strength flow into her and\r\nshe knew that she had found more comfort here than she ever would in the\r\narms of her own mother.\r\n\r\nIn the firelit wickiup, Redbird looked around her, thinking that this\r\nwas where Gray Cloud had been a baby. She looked at the bench where she\r\nknew he slept every night. Where he must sleep again.\r\n\r\n\"Do you have anything to give a person who has been very cold for a long\r\ntime?\" Redbird asked urgently.\r\n\r\n\"Ah.\" Sun Woman went to the back of the wickiup and came back with a\r\nbundle of long, dark red peppers.\r\n\r\n\"These peppers are grown far to the south, where the sacred mushroom and\r\nthe bright blue stones come from. The longer you boil them, the hotter\r\nthe water will get. He is to drink the water, but not swallow the\r\npeppers. If he is very cold, give him one pepper to chew on. That would\r\nbring the dead back to life. If you meet him before I do, this is how\r\nyou can help him.\"\r\n\r\n_She thinks I mean to try to meet him when he comes back._\r\n\r\n\"I will go to him,\" Redbird said abruptly.\r\n\r\nSun Woman stared at her. \"You must not. If you interrupt his spirit\r\njourney it might kill him.\"\r\n\r\n\"He has been in a cave for a night and a day, and this is the second\r\nnight, colder than any night I can remember. My father watches for him,\r\nbut he does not come. He could still be sitting in that cave. He has no\r\nfire. He has no food or water. The wind blows in from the river. The\r\nsnow here at the camp is so deep that in some places the drifts are over\r\nmy head. The cave could be full of snow. When he is suffering all this,\r\nhow can you say that _I_ am a danger to him?\"\r\n\r\nSun Woman sat cross-legged on the rush mat floor and stared down at her\r\nhands folded in her lap. After a silence she looked up, and her grave,\r\ndark eyes held Redbird's.\r\n\r\n\"You are a good young woman, and you love my son. But you must\r\nunderstand that the greater danger to Gray Cloud is not from the cold.\r\nIf you try to wake Gray Cloud's body when his soul is gone from it, his\r\nspirit will never come back to his empty body. It will set its feet on\r\nthe Trail of Souls and walk west, to the land of the dead.\"\r\n\r\nSun Woman's eyes shone, and the shadows and firelight gave her the face\r\nof an angry spirit. Redbird drew back.\r\n\r\n\"I will not do that,\" she said. \"I promise you.\" But if she saw that\r\nGray Cloud would surely die anyway, of freezing, would it not then be\r\nbest to take the risk of waking him?\r\n\r\nAnd what if he did wake on his own, but was too frozen to climb out of\r\nthe cave and walk back to the camp by himself? Then he would need her\r\nhelp.\r\n\r\nShe decided that if she got to the cave and his spirit was still out of\r\nhis body, she would do everything to help him short of waking him. She\r\nwould build a fire near him. She would cover him with warm cloaks, try\r\nto warm his body if she could do that without disturbing him.\r\n\r\nShe boiled the peppers in a small tin pot set on stones over Sun Woman's\r\nlow fire. After she had filled a skin with the pepper water, she rolled\r\ntinder and a pale eyes fire striker into a blanket. She put her hand on\r\nSun Woman's snowshoes, leaning against a wall of the little wickiup, and\r\nSun Woman nodded silently.\r\n\r\nRedbird paddled over the snow with her head down, watching the long\r\nshadow she cast under the full moon on the sparkling white surface.\r\nAhead, the leeward sides of the wickiups were rows of snowdrifts, all\r\nthe same size. When she looked over her shoulder, their windward sides\r\nwere like black holes in the snow. She could see her family's wickiup,\r\nbut Owl Carver was no longer standing outside watching. She lifted her\r\nround wickerwork snowshoes high with each step. Even though she could\r\nwalk over the snow, she would be exhausted, she realized, long before\r\nshe pushed her way to the sacred cave.\r\n\r\nDogs barked. Fear made the back of her neck tingle, and she stood\r\nmotionless. They might be Wolf Paw's dogs. But they did not come after\r\nher.\r\n\r\nShe heard no sounds of voices, or of people moving. She felt safe enough\r\nto keep walking.\r\n\r\nBut a feeling grew on her that someone was following her. She stopped\r\nagain and listened and looked around. The wickiups were silent under\r\ntheir glistening blue-white hummocks. Being able to sense when she was\r\nbeing watched was one of the gifts she, like her father, possessed. But\r\nher eyes and ears did not confirm what her inner sense told her. She\r\ndecided fear was confusing her, and she walked on.\r\n\r\nShe left the camp behind. On her right was gently rolling, snow-covered\r\nprairie. On her left were the woods that grew along the Ioway River. She\r\nsaw the shadows of the horses among the trees, heard them snort and\r\nstamp their feet. Beside the woods ran the long trail leading to the\r\nbluff where the sacred cave overlooked the river. This close to the\r\ntrees, she hoped, the snow would not be so deep.\r\n\r\nA shadow appeared on the snow beside her. A bolt of terror stabbed her.\r\n\r\nA powerful hand seized her arm. She felt paralyzed, like a rabbit about\r\nto be torn apart by a wildcat. She did not try to pull away. She could\r\nfeel that the grip on her arm was too strong.\r\n\r\nShe turned slowly.\r\n\r\nThe moon was behind the man who held her, shadowing his face, but she\r\ncould make out the glitter of piercing eyes, a stern mouth with strong\r\nlips under his brown fur turban.\r\n\r\n\"Where are you going?\" Wolf Paw's fingers hurt her arm.\r\n\r\nNo words came to her. Frantically, she tried to think of some excuse for\r\nwalking out so late on a night like this. He could have her killed, she\r\nthought, and terror made her feel like sinking into the snow.\r\n\r\nBut then she remembered some of the lore Sun Woman had taught her.\r\n\r\n\"My father sent me--to look for a certain herb whose power is greatest\r\nwhen the moon is full.\"\r\n\r\nHe barked disdainfully. \"Gathering herbs when the snow is up to your\r\nknees?\"\r\n\r\n\"It grows under the snow.\"\r\n\r\nHe brought his face so close to hers that his black eyes seemed to fill\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n\"You cannot lie to me, Redbird. I see what you are doing. You are going\r\nto _him_.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, I am looking for herbs.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is _this_?\" With his free hand he tore away the blanket roll she\r\nhad tied to her back and threw it into the snow. \"And _this_?\" He jerked\r\non the water skin so hard that the strap broke, and he threw that down,\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\n\"Do you need those things to help you find herbs?\" he shouted.\r\n\r\nTrembling from head to foot, she felt herself starting to cry. She hated\r\nherself for showing such weakness in front of Wolf Paw. If she was to\r\ndie, she wanted to be strong.\r\n\r\nTo her surprise, the sense that she was being watched from a distance\r\ncame back again. There was someone else out here in the frozen darkness\r\nbesides herself and Wolf Paw.\r\n\r\n\"It is death to interfere with a spirit quest,\" Wolf Paw growled. \"The\r\nshaman's daughter of all people should know better than to break a holy\r\nlaw.\"\r\n\r\nHer fear made her feel as cold, as breathless, as if she were already\r\nplunged into black, freezing water, swept along, an enormous weight of\r\nice between her and the air.\r\n\r\n\"I have done nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"You meant to. That is as bad.\"\r\n\r\nShe saw the hunting knife at Wolf Paw's belt. She could make a grab for\r\nit, try to stab him.\r\n\r\nNo, he was one of the tribe's mightiest braves. He would be too quick\r\nand strong for her. And, at least, up to now she had done no harm to\r\nanyone but herself. To try to murder the son of the war leader would be\r\na great crime.\r\n\r\nHis grip on her arm still cruelly tight, he gestured back behind him\r\ntoward the snow-covered camp. \"Think of your mother's weeping over what\r\nI caught you doing. Your father, his heart torn in his chest. But he,\r\nthe shaman, would have to say that you must be killed.\"\r\n\r\nHopelessness crushed her. Now she would never be able to help Gray\r\nCloud. He was going to die. And she was caught by Wolf Paw and would be\r\ndishonored before the whole tribe and then killed.\r\n\r\nShe hung her head.\r\n\r\n\"But it is true, Redbird, you have done nothing,\" Wolf Paw said more\r\nsoftly. \"I am the only one who knows that you were about to break the\r\nlaw.\"\r\n\r\n_Sun Woman knows. But Wolf Paw will never learn that from me._\r\n\r\n\"I do not want you to die, Redbird,\" said the low voice from the figure\r\ntowering over her.\r\n\r\nShe looked up at him. Was he going to be merciful?\r\n\r\nHe said, \"It makes me angry that you throw your life away for that\r\nfatherless pale eyes boy. To wed the son of Black Hawk would bring you\r\nhonor.\"\r\n\r\nShe understood now. He was going to offer to spare her life, if she\r\nwould marry him and give up Gray Cloud. He did not understand that she\r\nwould rather be dead twice over than spend her life mourning Gray Cloud\r\nand married to Wolf Paw.\r\n\r\nShe was about to tell him so when she heard a rumble, almost like\r\nthunder, from the trees nearer the camp. With much whinnying and\r\ncracking of shrubbery, all the band's horses burst out of the woods and\r\nran, floundering and kicking up clouds of snow, out on the prairie.\r\n\r\n\"Be still,\" Wolf Paw cautioned in a low voice, \"until we see what\r\nfrightened them.\" He stood with his head high, listening.\r\n\r\nWhatever it was, she was grateful that it had taken Wolf Paw's mind off\r\nher.\r\n\r\nShe heard a crashing in the forest, branches breaking, snow crunching.\r\nSomething large was coming toward them.\r\n\r\nShe turned. Through the trees she saw a bulky, hunched figure. It seemed\r\nto be a large animal, but it was walking on its hind legs. It came\r\nforward slowly, a step at a time. Its forelimbs swung at its sides. It\r\nwas a little taller than a man.\r\n\r\nIt looked very much like a bear. A new fear, greater than the fear of\r\nwhat Wolf Paw might do, assailed her.\r\n\r\nA bear in coldest winter, when all of that people withdrew to their dens\r\nand slept? Once in a while, she had heard, a very hungry bear would\r\nawaken and forage for food and then go back to sleep again. Such a bear\r\nwould kill anything it met. She tensed herself to run, though she knew\r\nshe could never outrun a hungry bear.\r\n\r\nThe shambling tread of the bear, or whatever it was, had brought it\r\ncloser, and she saw that it was all white, glittering in the moonlight\r\nlike a snowdrift.\r\n\r\nShe glanced at Wolf Paw and saw his eyes glisten as they widened. The\r\nlook on his shadowed face was one she never thought to see on him--fear.\r\n\r\nHe sucked in a shuddering breath. The hand that had held her arm\r\nsuddenly released her.\r\n\r\nNo wonder Wolf Paw was afraid. This was a white bear, a spirit bear. Its\r\neyes, reflecting the moonlight, seemed to glow.\r\n\r\nWolf Paw uttered a terrified, inarticulate cry. She turned to see him\r\nracing over the snow. Were she not so frightened herself, she might have\r\nlaughed to see how his knees flew up, first one, then the other, as\r\nwhite clouds sprayed from his snowshoes. Strong as he was, he could\r\nnever outrun a bear. Especially not this bear.\r\n\r\nAs for herself, she was surely doomed. She thought, _May this be a\r\nbetter death than drowning under the ice_.\r\n\r\nAnd she turned to face the spirit bear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nClaw Marks\r\n\r\n\r\nThe white bear was out of the forest now. Redbird had seen bears run,\r\nand she knew it could cover the distance that separated them in a few\r\nbounds.\r\n\r\nIt did not seem to be looking at her, and she wondered if it saw her. It\r\nsparkled in the moonlight. Its breath came in huge frosty clouds,\r\nobscuring its head. Did spirit bears breathe?\r\n\r\nShe looked around again to see where Wolf Paw was. He had become a\r\nsmall, dark spot against the white at the edge of the village. His\r\nsnowshoes had carried him far quickly. She, too, would have run, if she\r\ncould run like Wolf Paw.\r\n\r\nShe did not think Wolf Paw a coward. His courage was well known. Facing\r\na being like this, the bravest man in the world would run.\r\n\r\n_It doesn't seem to see me. Maybe it is best to stand still._\r\n\r\nShe trembled from head to foot, unable to decide what to do. She felt\r\ndizzy, as if she might collapse into the snow. The bright light that\r\nseemed to come from the bear dazzled her.\r\n\r\nBut would a spirit bear attack people in the night and kill them? Devils\r\nand cannibal giants would, but she had never heard of a spirit doing any\r\nsuch thing.\r\n\r\nShe was learning to be a medicine woman, and a medicine woman must deal\r\nunafraid with the beings of the other world. Talk the bad spirits out of\r\na sick person's body and call upon the good spirits to aid in healing.\r\n\r\nShe took a deep breath. Whether this be a good spirit or a devil, she\r\nwould stand here holding herself proudly. Wolf Paw, if he looked back,\r\nwould see the maiden he had threatened standing in the place he had run\r\nfrom.\r\n\r\nThe white bear took a step toward her.\r\n\r\nIn spite of her fear, she made herself look at the spirit as it came on.\r\nIt walked so slowly. Perhaps, after all, she could run away from it.\r\n\r\nUnder the pointed snout she saw eyes that seemed to glow out of a\r\nshadowed face.\r\n\r\nIt was a man she was facing.\r\n\r\nShe saw that its path was taking it past her. It--he--did not seem to\r\nsee her at all. But he was close enough now for her to see the face\r\nunder the bear's skull. The large, round eyes, the long, thin features\r\nending in a pointed chin, the bony beak of a nose, the down-curving,\r\ntender mouth. His face was covered with a mask of frost.\r\n\r\nGray Cloud.\r\n\r\nHow could she have forgotten that when he walked out of the camp\r\nyesterday he had worn a black bear's skin draped over his arms and\r\nshoulders? Snow and frost had turned the fur white. The night and her\r\nterror had tricked her into thinking she saw a white bear spirit. Wolf\r\nPaw, the seasoned warrior, had been tricked and terrified, too.\r\n\r\nGray Cloud was alive!\r\n\r\nA scream tried to force its way out of her chest, but her windpipe was\r\nso tight that all she managed was a gasp.\r\n\r\nJoy blazed up in her like a summer campfire.\r\n\r\nBut no--he could not be alive and look like that. What she was seeing\r\nmust be the ghost of Gray Cloud, or his dead body walking. The cold and\r\nsnow had killed him there in the sacred cave, and this shuffling, frozen\r\nhusk was all that was left of him.\r\n\r\n\"Gray Cloud,\" she whispered, unable to speak aloud, \"talk to me.\"\r\n\r\nIf he walked right past her without seeing her, he must be still on his\r\nspirit journey. She had always heard that the bodies of men on a spirit\r\njourney remained motionless, sitting or lying down. But she was certain\r\nthat Gray Cloud was not fully awake.\r\n\r\nShe stood staring at him, her mouth open, as he shambled on past her.\r\n\r\nShe slowly turned to follow him, and now she was facing into the\r\nmoonlight and seeing the shadows of the snow-covered wickiups. He was\r\nwalking in that frighteningly slow, measured way toward the village.\r\nWolf Paw was nowhere to be seen.\r\n\r\nThe feeling came to her again of other eyes upon her. Besides Wolf Paw,\r\nbesides the strange creature Gray Cloud had become, someone else seemed\r\nto be out here in the snow-covered field with her. She shuddered.\r\n\r\nShe looked around to see if she could guess where the secret watcher\r\nmight be hiding. Someone might be crouching behind one of the long\r\nsnowdrifts that rippled across the prairie like waves on a lake. Or in\r\nthe trees by the river.\r\n\r\nShe must not let herself be caught out here. She picked up the blanket\r\nroll and water skin that Wolf Paw had thrown into the snow and padded on\r\nher snowshoes after the lumbering white figure. She must hurry and try\r\nto get to a place where her presence would be unnoticed, or if noticed,\r\nnot questioned.\r\n\r\nHer legs ached. She did not have the strength to run. Gray Cloud had\r\nleft a trail of two shallow furrows in the snow where he had pushed his\r\nlegs through and the snow had fallen in behind him. On her snowshoes she\r\npressed on behind him.\r\n\r\nEven though the snowshoes helped her, her legs ached. She wanted to\r\nthrow down her burdens of blanket roll and water skin, but they were too\r\nvaluable for her to let them be lost out here. Merciless pain shot up\r\nfrom her shins through her knees to her hips. Still, the miseries felt\r\nby her body could not touch the joy of her spirit. Gray Cloud lived.\r\n\r\nA wall of fur coated with white snow loomed up before her. As Gray Cloud\r\nlumbered along, she quickly stepped to the side and hurried around him.\r\n\r\nShe turned for a closer look at him. His steaming breath obscured his\r\nface. He stopped. He swayed, and the bear's skull fell back from his\r\nlolling head. She screamed, a sound that rang distantly in her ears.\r\n\r\nGray Cloud dropped to his knees, then fell forward on his face, sending\r\nup a great puff of powdery snow that glittered in the moonlit air.\r\n\r\nThe silence after his fall was as stunning as thunder. Redbird felt\r\ntears stream from her eyes--and freeze at once on her cheeks. That he\r\nshould have lived through two nights of blizzard and cold, that he\r\nshould come down alive from the sacred cave, only to die within sight of\r\nthe village under her very eyes, was more than she could stand.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no!\" she whispered. \"He must not die.\"\r\n\r\nShe fell to her knees beside him.\r\n\r\nHe lay face down, half buried. She put her hands under his shoulder and\r\npushed to raise his head. He was heavy, but her fear and her love for\r\nhim made her strong enough to move him. She lifted his upper body and\r\nturned him on his side, and she saw the beloved features, frost-white.\r\nHope made her heart beat faster as little clouds of warm air puffed from\r\nhis nostrils. But his breathing was ragged and shallow. She had to get\r\nhim in out of the cold. Gasping with the effort, she rolled him over on\r\nhis back.\r\n\r\nShe would have to try to drag him to the village.\r\n\r\nSobbing with near-exhaustion, she sat by his head, shoved her hands\r\nunder his shoulders and tried to stand, pulling him up with her.\r\n\r\nAll at once there was no weight on her arms. Someone else was there,\r\nlifting Gray Cloud.\r\n\r\nShe looked up, thankful, yet afraid she might see Wolf Paw returned to\r\ndo them harm.\r\n\r\nNo, it was Iron Knife.\r\n\r\nSeeing the broad face of her half brother, a cry of relief burst from\r\nher throat.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Iron Knife! It is so good you are here.\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled grimly, grunting as he hauled Gray Cloud to his feet. Gray\r\nCloud's eyes were shut, his mouth hanging open.\r\n\r\n\"Lucky for Wolf Paw that Gray Cloud came when he did,\" Iron Knife said.\r\n\"I was getting an arrow ready for Wolf Paw.\" He jerked his head at the\r\nbow slung over his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Even the son of Black Hawk?\" She vividly remembered Wolf Paw's threats,\r\nbut the thought of Iron Knife murdering him horrified her.\r\n\r\n\"Do you think I'd let him drown my sister?\" Iron Knife put an arm around\r\nGray Cloud's shoulders, bent down and picked him up under the knees,\r\nbearskin cloak and all. Blowing a cloud of steam out of his mouth, he\r\nstraightened, cradling Gray Cloud in his arms. Though Gray Cloud was\r\nnearly as tall as Iron Knife, he was much lighter.\r\n\r\nIt was Iron Knife, she realized, whose eyes she had felt on her after\r\nWolf Paw ran away.\r\n\r\nThey started off for the camp. She heard the voices of men and women\r\nraised, calling to one another. Wolf Paw must have given the alarm.\r\n\r\n\"How did you know I was out here?\" she asked. \"You were sleeping when I\r\nleft the wickiup.\"\r\n\r\n\"Father woke me,\" Iron Knife said, striding stolidly along, his\r\ncalf-high outer moccasins of buffalo hide breaking through the snow. \"He\r\nknew what you were going to do. He told me to go after you, to see you\r\ncame to no harm.\"\r\n\r\nAs they plowed steadily onward, Redbird saw figures moving about in the\r\nvillage. They must be terribly sleepy, she thought. Dawn was still a\r\nlong way off. Still, more and more people were running back and forth\r\namong the wickiups. They were crowding in this direction, coming to meet\r\nGray Cloud and Iron Knife and Redbird. A mass of people, dark against\r\nthe moonlit snow.\r\n\r\nIn the front rank walked Owl Carver himself. The sacred necklace of\r\nmegis shells swung on his chest. In one hand he held his medicine stick,\r\na cedar staff decorated with feathers and beads, topped with the carved\r\nhead of an owl. His long white hair spread out over his shoulders.\r\n\r\nShe could hear a murmuring of voices, and above them, the shaman, her\r\nfather, singing:\r\n\r\n    \"Let the people welcome him.\r\n    He has walked the spirit trail.\r\n    He comes back\r\n    From the sky,\r\n    From the water,\r\n    From under the earth.\r\n    He comes back from the seven directions.\r\n    Let the people welcome him.\"\r\n\r\nOwl Carver was dancing as he approached them, a slow, heavy shuffle\r\nalternating with sidesteps, his upper body rising and falling. His\r\nhands, one holding his medicine stick, the other a yellow and red gourd\r\nrattle, were lifted high over his head. The necklace of small black and\r\nwhite shells bounced on his chest.\r\n\r\nIron Knife, carrying Gray Cloud, came to a stop before Owl Carver.\r\nRedbird, not wanting people to know how she cared for Gray Cloud, drew\r\naway from Iron Knife and tried to melt into the crowd.\r\n\r\nTaking a few more steps, Owl Carver placed himself facing east, with\r\nIron Knife and Gray Cloud on his right. He danced in a sunwise circle\r\naround them, from east to south to west to north, bobbing his head and\r\nsinging.\r\n\r\n    \"The Great Wise One has sent him.\r\n    He has walked the spirit trail.\r\n    He brings wisdom\r\n    From the sky,\r\n    From the water,\r\n    From under the earth.\r\n    He comes back from the seven directions.\r\n    The Great Wise One has sent him.\"\r\n\r\nNine times Owl Carver danced around Gray Cloud and Iron Knife in the\r\ncircle that represented the sun, the horizon and the cycles of life and\r\nthe seasons.\r\n\r\nThen in his normal voice, not breaking step, he said, \"Bring him to my\r\nmedicine wickiup.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned abruptly and danced through the crowd that had gathered. The\r\npeople parted to let him through and they stared at Gray Cloud's body in\r\nIron Knife's arms.\r\n\r\nThe people who had followed Owl Carver had stamped down a path through\r\nthe village. No longer needing Sun Woman's snowshoes, Redbird bent and\r\nunstrapped them from her feet. She was suddenly so exhausted by her\r\nefforts and by the fear and sleeplessness of two days that she could\r\nhardly stumble along behind Iron Knife. She felt that at any moment she\r\nmight faint.\r\n\r\nThe light of the full moon, shining down from directly overhead and\r\nreflecting on the snow, seemed to make the whole village almost as\r\nbright as day. Sighing, Redbird looked up and saw Wolf Paw staring at\r\nher from beside the path.\r\n\r\nHis black eyes pierced her like arrowheads. Under his sharp nose his\r\nmouth was tight.\r\n\r\nShe nodded her head at him, hoping he would understand that she was\r\nsaying that they should keep each other's secrets.\r\n\r\n\"Redbird!\" A hand seized her arm roughly, and pain shot through up to\r\nher shoulder.\r\n\r\nHer mother, Wind Bends Grass, glared at her furiously.\r\n\r\n\"Why did you leave our wickiup?\"\r\n\r\nRedbird felt that if she stopped walking to talk she would never be able\r\nto move again. She pulled her arm free. Her sisters, clinging to either\r\nside of her mother, stared up wide-eyed at her as if she herself had\r\nreturned from a spirit journey.\r\n\r\nHer mother walked beside her, scolding her in a shrill voice, but her\r\nwords meant nothing to Redbird. She only wanted to see Gray Cloud\r\nbrought safely to the shaman's wickiup.\r\n\r\nSomeone else took her arm, squeezing it gently, and she looked up into\r\nSun Woman's face. Tears streaked the strong cheekbones.\r\n\r\n\"You saved his life,\" Sun Woman said, so softly only Redbird could hear\r\nthe words.\r\n\r\n\"I did nothing,\" Redbird protested. Silently, Sun Woman took the\r\nsnowshoes, the water bag and the blanket roll from her.\r\n\r\nOwl Carver stopped at the doorway of the medicine wickiup. He danced\r\nfrom one foot to the other, shaking his staff.\r\n\r\nHe nodded at Iron Knife, and motioned him to carry Gray Cloud into the\r\ndark interior.\r\n\r\nRedbird followed. The owl-headed stick barred her way.\r\n\r\n\"Go with your mother,\" Owl Carver said softly. \"You have done enough\r\nthis night.\"\r\n\r\nShe could not tell whether he was praising or reproaching her.\r\n\r\n_Will he live?_ she wanted to ask. But his solemn face forbade her to\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\nShe turned away from his remoteness and faced her mother's anger. Her\r\nheart was still full of terror for Gray Cloud, but she knew that the\r\ninstant she lay down she would fall into an exhausted sleep.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt seemed that no time had passed when Wind Bends Grass shook her awake.\r\n\r\n\"Your father calls the people together,\" she said in a voice still hard\r\nwith anger.\r\n\r\nRedbird's eyelids felt as if they were made of stone. She forced herself\r\nto sit up, and then with immense effort got to her feet.\r\n\r\nShe was still fully dressed, even in her fur cloak and mittens. She had\r\ncollapsed in the wickiup without removing anything. The wickiup was now\r\nempty. Her mother and her sisters had gone ahead without her.\r\n\r\nHer heart hammered in her chest. Owl Carver might be calling the people\r\nto tell them that Gray Cloud was dead.\r\n\r\nOutside, the air was still deathly cold, but the sun was a bright yellow\r\ndisk rising above the distant gray line of trees that marked the bluffs\r\noverlooking the Great River. The light made her blink, and she turned\r\naway from it. She stumbled in the direction all the other people were\r\ngoing--to the medicine wickiup in the center of the camp circle.\r\n\r\nShe found that the open area before the wickiup was crowded, and she\r\ncould not get close. The spaces between nearby wickiups were also filled\r\nwith people, all waiting for Owl Carver to speak.\r\n\r\nShe seated herself between two women, both of whom had small children on\r\ntheir laps. Redbird knew one of the mothers, Water Flows Fast, a stout\r\nwoman with a round, cheerful face and shrewd eyes.\r\n\r\nWater Flows Fast said, \"You are the daughter of Owl Carver. You should\r\ngo up and sit close to him.\" Redbird sliced her hand flat across her\r\nbody to say no. She knew Water Flows Fast to be a keen observer and a\r\ngossip, always looking for signs of trouble in other people's families.\r\nThe less Redbird said to her, the better.\r\n\r\nRedbird looked over her shoulder and saw that now there were many more\r\npeople packed in behind her. Everyone was talking at once, and the\r\nhundreds of voices beating upon her ears made her head hurt. About five\r\nhundred people were here, everyone in this camp, which was one of four\r\nthat made up the British Band of the Sauk and Fox tribes that would come\r\ntogether in Saukenuk after the winter snow and ice melted.\r\n\r\nThe medicine wickiup was built on a low hill in the center of the camp,\r\nand when Owl Carver appeared, everyone who was standing sat down.\r\nRedbird's eyes devoured Owl Carver's face, trying to read in it whether\r\nGray Cloud was alive or dead.\r\n\r\nAnother man emerged from the medicine wickiup to stand beside Owl\r\nCarver. His head was bare even on this terribly cold day, and he wore\r\nhis hair in the manner of a brave, his dark brown scalp shaved except\r\nfor a long black scalplock that coiled down the side of his face. His\r\neyes were shadowed and sad-looking, and there were heavy blue-black\r\npouches under them. His cheekbones jutted out and his mouth was wide,\r\ncurving down at the corners where it met deep furrows that ran from nose\r\nto chin.\r\n\r\nRedbird's heart beat faster as she saw that to honor this moment he had\r\nattached a string of eagle feathers to his scalplock and wore strings of\r\nsmall white beads around the rim of each ear. He stood with his arms\r\nfolded under a buffalo robe, skin side out, painted with a red hand\r\nproclaiming that he had killed and scalped his first enemy while still a\r\nboy.\r\n\r\nHis sombre gaze fell upon Redbird like a stone striking her from a great\r\nheight. She felt as if the war chief of the British Band knew every one\r\nof her secrets. She ducked her head and looked down at her mittened\r\nhands in her lap.\r\n\r\nOwl Carver raised his arms, and the people fell silent.\r\n\r\n\"I have called on Black Hawk, our war chief, to see Gray Cloud, and he\r\nhas heard great prophecies from Gray Cloud's lips,\" the shaman cried in\r\na high, chanting voice.\r\n\r\nThen Gray Cloud had lived through the night!\r\n\r\nOwl Carver blurred in Redbird's sight, and if she had not already been\r\nseated, she might have collapsed. Relief made her heart swell up in her\r\nchest, feeling as if it might burst.\r\n\r\nThe people around her murmured in surprise, pleasure and curiosity.\r\n\r\nThe shaman stretched out his hand. \"Sun Woman, stand before the people.\"\r\n\r\nNothing happened for a long moment. Then Owl Carver beckoned\r\ninsistently. There was another silence. Then Black Hawk's hand emerged\r\nfrom under his buffalo mantle, and he crooked his finger.\r\n\r\nA tall woman wrapped in a buffalo robe rose from among the seated\r\npeople. People sighed happily and called out a welcome to her.\r\n\r\nSun Woman turned to face the crowd. To Redbird she seemed calm and\r\nunruffled, even though she had hesitated about standing up.\r\n\r\n\"This woman brought her son to me and asked me to train him as a\r\nshaman,\" Owl Carver declared. \"I did not want to, because he is not a\r\npure Sauk. She said to me, only try him for a little time and see what\r\nhe can be. I tried him for a little time and I saw something in him. I\r\nsaw sleeping powers!\"\r\n\r\nThe people murmured in wonder. Water Flows Fast and the woman with her\r\nwhispered to each other, darting curious glances at Redbird, who\r\ncarefully kept her face as impassive as Sun Woman's.\r\n\r\n\"I tested him and saw that his dreams could foretell the future, that he\r\ncould send his spirit walking while his body lay still, that he could\r\ntalk to the spirits in trees and birds. I saw that he had the power to\r\nbe a shaman and more ...\"\r\n\r\nOwl Carver paused and stared at them fiercely.\r\n\r\n\"And so I sent him up to the sacred cave, knowing that he might meet\r\nspirits so powerful that to encounter them destroys the souls of men.\r\n\r\n\"And Gray Cloud went into the sacred cave, and he met the great spirits,\r\nand he journeyed with them,\" Owl Carver cried. People gasped.\r\n\r\n\"He has met the White Bear. He has spoken with the Turtle, father of the\r\nGreat River. He has brought back a message for Black Hawk,\" said Owl\r\nCarver. \"The Turtle told Gray Cloud that Black Hawk might tell others as\r\nhe saw fit.\" The rumble of voices rose at this, and then quieted as Owl\r\nCarver raised his medicine stick.\r\n\r\n\"After the Turtle created our Mother the Earth, he mated with her, and\r\nall tribes were born in her womb,\" Owl Carver said. \"They lived there in\r\na warm darkness, but they had to go forth and find their way out of our\r\nMother. Then there came to our ancestors an elder spirit, the White\r\nBear, who led them out the womb of our Mother.\r\n\r\n\"When they were in the light, they found themselves in the midst of a\r\nring of fiery mountains. Our people are called Osaukawug, or Sauk, the\r\nPeople of the Place of Fire, because that fiery place is where we first\r\nwalked in the world. There was nothing to eat. There was nothing around\r\nthe people but stones and fire. And they were hungry and greatly afraid,\r\nand they were angry at the White Bear for leading them out of our Mother\r\nto this place.\r\n\r\n\"But the White Bear showed them a way through the fiery mountains and\r\nover many fields of snow and ice, until he brought our ancestors to this\r\ngood land where there is fish and game, where the grasslands are green\r\nand the woods are full of berries and fruit. And our friends the Fox,\r\nthe Yellow Earth People, came to be our allies and to unite with us. And\r\nthe Turtle opened his heart and the Great River flowed forth. Our\r\nancestors hunted and fished in the land where the Rock River flows into\r\nthe Great River. On the Rock River they built our village of Saukenuk,\r\nwhere they would dwell in the summer and their women would grow the\r\nThree Sisters, corn, beans and squash, in the fields around the village.\r\nAnd there at Saukenuk, as our ancestors died, they were buried.\r\n\r\n\"The White Bear told us we should spend our summers in that land east of\r\nthe Great River. In the winter it should be our custom to cross to the\r\nwest of the Great River and hunt here in the Ioway Country. And here by\r\nthe Great River we Sauk, the People of the Place of Fire, have lived\r\never since.\"\r\n\r\nRedbird felt warmth on her back through her buffalo robe. The sun had\r\nrisen higher.\r\n\r\nOwl Carver called out in his high voice of prophecy, \"The White Bear has\r\ncome again. He has led Gray Cloud on his spirit journey. Now Gray Cloud\r\nis a true shaman. He still must be trained to use his powers, but his\r\npowers no longer sleep. And in sign that he is a shaman with another\r\nself, he shall have a new name. Let him be known to all the people as\r\nWhite Bear!\"\r\n\r\nRedbird heard cries of assent from the people around her.\r\n\r\nOwl Carver crossed his arms before his chest to show that he was\r\nfinished speaking, and turned to Black Hawk.\r\n\r\n\"So let it be,\" said Black Hawk in his harsh, grating voice. \"Earthmaker\r\nhas willed that the British Band shall be blessed with a mighty new\r\nspirit walker. Let his name hereafter be White Bear.\"\r\n\r\n_If I could make a spirit journey_, Redbird thought, _I too could stand\r\nbefore the people and advise them_.\r\n\r\nShe came to a sudden resolve. _One day I will._\r\n\r\n\"Now you shall see our new shaman,\" Owl Carver declared. He stepped back\r\nand pulled aside the buffalo-fur curtain that covered the door of his\r\nwickiup.\r\n\r\nA tall young man came out, stooping to pass through the doorway and then\r\nstanding straight before the people. Redbird's heart beat faster, and\r\nshe half rose to her feet.\r\n\r\nHis slender body, despite the cold, was bare to the waist. Redbird\r\ngasped as she saw what was on his chest.\r\n\r\nFive long, deep scratches, side by side. The blood had dried and turned\r\nblack. Five long black marks down the middle of his pale chest, running\r\nalmost from the base of his neck to the bottom of his rib cage.\r\n\r\nCries of awe and wonder arose from the people. They had all seen such\r\nmarks, sometimes scratched in the bark of trees, sometimes on the\r\nhalf-eaten bodies of animals found in the forest in summer.\r\n\r\nThe claw marks of a bear.\r\n\r\nAnd now his name was White Bear. She whispered it to herself. Her eyes\r\nsaw nothing but the shining slender form, and her ears heard nothing but\r\nthe sound of his name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nMaster of Victoire\r\n\r\n\r\nRaoul threw himself into the lake, the giant Potawatomi chief Black\r\nSalmon roaring behind him. The water resisted his legs like molasses.\r\nBlack Salmon seized Raoul's neck, cutting off his breath. Strangling, he\r\nwas helpless as the Potawatomi dragged him back to shore.\r\n\r\nThe huge Indian's whip tore into Raoul's back. Raoul felt the skin\r\nripping and the blood running. He was nothing but a helpless lump of\r\nbleeding flesh, paralyzed with pain.\r\n\r\nOther Potawatomi had torn Helene's clothes off. The warriors danced\r\naround her on the beach as she cowered, white skin, shining blond hair,\r\ntrying to cover herself.\r\n\r\nThe Indian bucks were naked, too, and flaunted their erect purple cocks,\r\nbig as war clubs. One of them darted into the circle and bit a piece out\r\nof poor Helene's shoulder. Bright red blood flowed down her arm.\r\n\r\nRaoul ran to save his sister. He broke away from Black Salmon and fought\r\nhis way through the Potawatomi warriors around her. She lay on her back\r\non the sand, twisting her body from side to side in pain. Hideous bite\r\nwounds all over her body lay open like red mouths silently screaming.\r\nOne breast was covered with blood.\r\n\r\nThe Indians fell upon Raoul. They had their scalping knives out and they\r\nthrew him down on the ground beside Helene. Black Salmon caught up with\r\nhim and whipped him till every inch of his body was slashed. The\r\nredskins tore away the last few rags of Raoul's clothing.\r\n\r\nA circle of grimacing dark faces painted with yellow and black stripes\r\nclosed in on him. They bared sharp teeth like snarling dogs. They were\r\ngoing to eat him alive.\r\n\r\nRaoul's father and Raoul's brother, Pierre, faces marble and calm,\r\nappeared in the midst of the Indians. They looked down at Raoul's agony.\r\nJust curious.\r\n\r\nRaoul tried to cry out, \"Papa! Pierre! Help us! They're killing us!\"\r\n\r\nNo sound came out of his mouth but a useless little wheeze. He had lost\r\nhis voice.\r\n\r\n\"You should not have angered them,\" Papa said.\r\n\r\nOne of the savages, holding high a long, thin skinning knife, seized\r\nRaoul's balls. He brought the knife down, slowly.\r\n\r\nRaoul kept trying to scream at his father and brother. Again and again\r\nhe forced air through his aching throat. Nothing came but a silly\r\nsqueak. Then a groan, a little louder.\r\n\r\nPierre reached out a marble hand to him. Thank God!\r\n\r\nJust as their fingers touched, Pierre jerked his hand away and\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nRaoul felt the Indian's blade like cold fire slicing through the sac\r\nbetween his legs. At last he let out a full-throated scream.\r\n\r\n\"Raoul!\"\r\n\r\nHis body cold and wet with sweat, he sat up in darkness. He felt arms\r\nclutching at him and fought them off.\r\n\r\n\"Raoul! Wake up.\"\r\n\r\nPanting, he said his name in his mind. _I am Raoul François Philippe\r\nCharles de Marion._ He repeated it over and over again to himself.\r\n\r\nHe was sitting in bed in the dark, someone beside him. Not an Indian,\r\nand not his long-dead sister Helene. He gasped again and again, as if he\r\nhad run a race.\r\n\r\nHe tried to pull his mind together. His heart was still pounding against\r\nthe wall of his chest, his hands trembling, his skin ice cold. That\r\nterrible dream! He hadn't had it in a year or more.\r\n\r\n\"Lordy, what a nightmare you must have had! You did a right smart of\r\nhollerin'.\"\r\n\r\nIn the dim light seeping in through cracks in the shuttered window,\r\nRaoul saw a woman with long blond hair sitting up beside him, staring at\r\nhim with pale blue eyes.\r\n\r\nClarissa. Clarissa Greenglove. He looked down at her. A warmth began to\r\ncreep back into his body, rising first in his loins, as he remembered\r\nwhat they had done together the night before. Five times! No--six! Never\r\nbefore had he done it that many times in one night.\r\n\r\nHe was still panting in the aftermath of the horror, but the sight of\r\nher naked body was helping him get the dream out of his mind.\r\n\r\nNever done it with such a good-looking woman.\r\n\r\nShe looked down at herself and drew up the sheet to cover her breasts.\r\n\r\n\"Don't do that,\" he said, and pulled the sheet down again, none too\r\ngently.\r\n\r\nHe began to rub her breast with the palm of his hand, feeling the nipple\r\nget bigger and harder. She closed her eyes and gave a little murmur of\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\nHow she'd enjoyed it last night! She'd sighed and groaned and whimpered\r\nand screamed and licked him and bit him and twisted her body from side\r\nto side like a soul in perdition. Her frenzy had fired him up like never\r\nbefore. No wonder he'd been able to mount her so many times. And\r\nsomewhere near the end of it all she'd sobbed into his shoulder for what\r\nseemed like an hour. He figured that was a tribute to what he had done\r\nto her. The sheets were still damp with their sweat, and the air in the\r\nlittle bedroom was thick with the musky odors of their secret juices.\r\n\r\nBut the redskins were still stalking in his brain, and he was still a\r\nlittle frightened. He didn't want to sit here in the dark.\r\n\r\n\"Light a candle, will you?\" he said. \"The striker's on that table.\"\r\n\r\nShe hesitated. \"Can I get dressed first?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hell no,\" he laughed. \"What difference would that make after last\r\nnight? I know you outside and in, Clarissa.\"\r\n\r\nShe giggled and got out of bed while he sat hugging his knees watching\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\"It's cold out here,\" she whined.\r\n\r\n\"Well, hurry and get that candle lit and get back in bed.\" The March air\r\nwhistled in through chinks in the log walls and shutters, and even\r\nthough the inn's chimney ran up through this room it didn't seem to\r\nhelp. He guessed that downstairs in the taproom someone had let the fire\r\ndie.\r\n\r\nClarissa's pale, rounded shape as she moved through the shadows made\r\nhim feel stronger by the moment. The women he'd had up to now--many of\r\nthem right here in this bed--had been older and well-used, and he hadn't\r\nenjoyed the look of their bodies that much. Clarissa was just the right\r\nage, old enough to be filled out, young enough to be slender and firm.\r\nHe guessed she must be sixteen or seventeen. Raoul had been bedding\r\nwomen since he was sixteen, for seven years now, and he'd never had a\r\nbetter night than this last one, with Clarissa.\r\n\r\nThen why, after such a shining night, did he have _that_ dream?\r\n\r\nAs the oil-soaked cotton ball flared up and Clarissa held a candlewick\r\nto the flame, the nightmare came back to him, and out of the roiling\r\nimages of red limbs and painted faces and blood and torn white bodies,\r\nhe dragged the reason for what he had dreamed. When he remembered it, he\r\nslumped a little, his delight in waking up next to a pretty young woman\r\nwiped away.\r\n\r\nHe heard again the stunning, infuriating words that had tumbled out of\r\nArmand Perrault's bushy brown beard.\r\n\r\n_I overheard your brother, Monsieur Pierre, talking to your father this\r\nmorning. He spoke of how he has always felt that he had abandoned his\r\nSauk Indian wife and their son, when he came back here and married\r\nMadame Marie-Blanche. Now that he is a widower, he says, he wants to \"do\r\nright by her and the boy.\"_\r\n\r\nThis thing about having a Sauk woman and a son--Pierre had never said\r\nanything about that.\r\n\r\nTo call some Indian whore a _wife_!\r\n\r\n_My brother, the master of Victoire, a squaw-man! Father of a mongrel\r\nson!_\r\n\r\nArmand had remarked sourly to Raoul, \"It seems Monsieur Pierre is a\r\ngreat one for doing _wrong_ by women.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul knew what he meant. He'd heard the rumor that after Marie-Blanche\r\nhad died, Pierre, a little crazy in his grief, had taken Armand's wife\r\nto bed a time or two, to comfort himself.\r\n\r\nBut that was nothing compared to what Pierre was threatening now.\r\n\r\n_Indians living in our home! A squaw in the bed where Pierre slept with\r\ngood Marie-Blanche!_\r\n\r\nHow could Pierre do such a thing, after what the Indians had done to\r\nHelene? After Raoul had spent two years beaten and enslaved by Black\r\nSalmon? How could Papa permit it?\r\n\r\nClarissa turned, holding out before her a lighted white candle in a\r\nlittle pewter dish. She didn't seem so shy now about letting him see her\r\nnaked. He let his eyes linger over her melon-shaped breasts, narrow\r\nwaist, the brown puff of hair where her long legs joined her wide hips.\r\n\r\nHe'd often felt a hankering for Clarissa since he'd hired her father,\r\nEli Greenglove, to help him run the trading post. But he'd thought it\r\nunwise to get mixed up with her. Eli was a dangerous man. Last night\r\nthat hadn't seemed to matter.\r\n\r\nAfter Armand had brought him the bad news, he'd turned to Kentucky\r\nwhiskey--Old Kaintuck--and to Clarissa, dancing with her to Registre\r\nBosquet's fiddle in the taproom to take his mind off this sudden insult\r\nPierre had flung at him. Late in the evening he'd stumbled upstairs\r\nbehind Clarissa to his bedroom in the inn, his hands up her skirts,\r\nfeeling the satiny skin of her legs.\r\n\r\nAnd then down on the bed, and--whiskey and all--six times!\r\n\r\nBut this morning his pleasure in her was spoiled by this treachery of\r\nPierre's.\r\n\r\nA squaw and a redskinned mongrel. Raoul wouldn't want Indians on the\r\nestate even as servants. Now Pierre was talking about these savages\r\nliving in Victoire as part of the family.\r\n\r\nHe felt a sudden, stinging bite down near his rear end, under the\r\ncovers. Angrily, he slapped at himself. Damned fleas and bedbugs. Levi\r\nPope's wife made a piss-poor job of laundering the bedding for the inn.\r\n\r\n_If I had a wife I'd make sure she kept the bugs out of my sheets._\r\n\r\nClarissa set the candle down on the table and climbed back into bed. She\r\nran her hand over his back.\r\n\r\nShe brought her face close to his, and he decided that, though he liked\r\nher arms and legs and hips and breasts, he didn't care for her weak\r\nchin, her washed-out blond hair and light blue eyes and the brown stain\r\non one of her front teeth.\r\n\r\nShe said, \"You've got scars all over your back. Somebody beat you. Your\r\npaw?\"\r\n\r\n\"My papa?\" The thought made him smile. \"No, the old man's not that\r\nsort.\"\r\n\r\n_But he's the kind of man who might forget about me for a while. Who\r\nmight let me be captured by Indians in 1812 and not manage to find me\r\nand ransom me till 1814._\r\n\r\n_The kind of man who might actually let my brother bring Indians into\r\nour home._\r\n\r\nThe scars. The scars reminded him every day of Fort Dearborn, August\r\n1812. The memories left scars inside. Memories of being ten years old,\r\ncowering in an Indian encampment with the other white captives from Fort\r\nDearborn while the warriors with their clubs and tomahawks approached,\r\ngrinning.\r\n\r\nIt hadn't happened the way he dreamed it. The Potawatomi had pulled a\r\nman, an army private, to his feet, while he begged for his life, and\r\ndragged him over to the campfire. In an agony of terror Raoul had\r\npressed against Helene, seated beside him on the ground. She put her arm\r\naround his shoulders and held him tight.\r\n\r\nHis sister Helene had seen her husband's throat cut and his scalp\r\nslashed away that very morning, when the Indians fell upon the\r\nretreating soldiers of Fort Dearborn and the civilians fleeing the tiny\r\nvillage called Checagou. But somehow Helene kept herself calm and strong\r\nafter witnessing Henri's terrible death. Raoul knew it was for his sake.\r\n\r\nRaoul had shut his eyes, and heard the clubs thud into the head and body\r\nof the soldier at the campfire, heard his screams, heard the silence of\r\ndeath when the screams stopped. A man's life had ended, just like that.\r\nRaoul trembled, hiding his face in Helene's side. Around him the other\r\nprisoners, men and women, sobbed and prayed.\r\n\r\nThe Indians took another soldier. They tied him to a stake and cut away\r\nbits of his flesh with the sharpened edges of clam shells. They worked\r\nat him for hours, until he bled to death.\r\n\r\nThe warriors came back for their next victim, sauntering among the\r\nprisoners, eyes aglow, painted faces like masks of monsters, stinking of\r\nthe whiskey they'd been drinking all night. This time he was sure they\r\nwere coming for him.\r\n\r\nBut they took Helene.\r\n\r\nHe had never forgotten her last words to him, spoken serenely as the\r\nPotawatomi seized her arms.\r\n\r\n\"I am going to join Henri. Pray to the Mother of God for me, Raoul.\"\r\n\r\nThe Indians dragged Helene into the woods. They took another woman as\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nThe Potawatomi squaws, seated around a nearby campfire, chattered among\r\nthemselves. They laughed whenever one of the women in the woods\r\nscreamed. Raoul could not believe that any of those sounds were coming\r\nfrom his sister's throat.\r\n\r\nThe helpless white prisoners covered their faces and prayed and\r\nwept--and the men cursed.\r\n\r\nHe had hated himself for not trying to help Helene, but he was too\r\nfrightened to move. Too frightened even to cry out. Brooding about it\r\nnow, nearly thirteen years later, he told himself once again that if\r\nhe'd tried to help Helene the Indians would have clubbed him to death.\r\nHe told himself that he had been only ten years old. That did not make\r\nany difference to the shame he felt when he remembered that night. He\r\nshould have gone to her. He should have fought to the death for her. He\r\ncould never forgive himself.\r\n\r\n_Why didn't we all fight and die? Wouldn't it have been better to attack\r\nthe Indians barehanded and be killed than to let that happen?_\r\n\r\nBut neither could he forgive Papa and Pierre. His father and brother had\r\nleft Raoul in Helene's care at Fort Dearborn, where her husband, Henri\r\nVaillancourt, ran the trading post of Papa's Illinois Fur Company. When\r\nit became apparent that a second war between England and the United\r\nStates was about to break out, Papa declared that land prices in\r\nIllinois were now as low as they would ever be, and he set off in search\r\nof likely land to buy for a family seat. Pierre had gone to the Sauk and\r\nFox Indians on the Rock River to talk about trade and land purchases\r\nwith them. Raoul had been happy enough to be left with Helene, who had\r\nbeen a mother to him as far back as he could remember. His own mother,\r\nHelene had gently explained to him, had gone to Heaven when he was born.\r\n\r\nWhen Raoul heard no more screams from the woods, he knew Helene had gone\r\nto Heaven, too.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, as the Indians began the march back to their village,\r\ndragging their bound captives, Raoul had seen Helene's naked body, with\r\nstab wounds in a hundred places, lying face down, half submerged in Lake\r\nMichigan's surf. He saw a round, red patch on top of her head. Later he\r\nsaw a brave who had tied to his belt a long hank of silver-blond hair,\r\nsurely Helene's, a circular piece of skin dangling down.\r\n\r\nThe Indians had chosen not to kill Raoul, perhaps because at ten he was\r\ntoo young to be a satisfying victim, but old enough to work. And so\r\nBlack Salmon had taken him for his slave. It made no difference whether\r\nhe worked well or poorly; Black Salmon let not a day go by without\r\nwhipping him, and fed him entrails and hominy grits. Only after Raoul\r\nhad endured two years of slavery did his father, Elysée, find him and\r\nransom him from Black Salmon.\r\n\r\nAnd when Raoul was older he came to understand the full horror of what\r\nthe Indians had done to Helene. They must have raped her over and over\r\nagain. And he hated himself and Pierre and Elysée all the more for\r\nletting it happen.\r\n\r\nBut most of all he hated Indians.\r\n\r\nIndians living at Victoire? He had to kill that notion of Pierre's right\r\nnow. He would put on his clothes and saddle Banner and ride up to the\r\nchâteau and set his father and brother straight.\r\n\r\nBut would they understand? Pierre, with his oh-so-tender conscience, who\r\nhad lived with the damned Sauk and Fox for years and slept with one of\r\ntheir dirty squaws? Elysée, buried in his books? Raoul remembered their\r\nmarble faces, as he had seen them in his dream.\r\n\r\nThey'd never understood him.\r\n\r\n\"Where did you get them scars?\" Clarissa asked, interrupting his\r\nthoughts as she ran her fingers lightly over the hard ridges on his\r\nback.\r\n\r\nRaoul told her about Black Salmon. \"He liked whipping me even better\r\nthan he liked whiskey. And when he got hold of whiskey he liked beating\r\nme even better.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor Raoul! And such a little boy.\" Clarissa's face drew down with\r\nsympathy. \"I'm powerful sorry for you.\" She pulled him to her.\r\n\r\nHe lowered his head to her breast and drew the nipple into his mouth,\r\npressing it with his teeth. They lay back together, and he enjoyed the\r\nfeel of the soft, feather-filled mattress and pillows billowing up\r\naround them.\r\n\r\nBy God, if he didn't feel himself getting big and hard to do it again.\r\nProudly he threw back the sheet and let her see what he had for her. She\r\nsmiled up at him, welcoming, her pale blue eyes shining in the\r\ncandlelight.\r\n\r\nHe could use her to help him forget a little longer about Pierre and his\r\nredskin wife and son.\r\n\r\nA sharp rapping at the bedroom door brought an end to his new surge of\r\ndesire.\r\n\r\nClarissa gasped and pulled away from Raoul, dragging the bedclothes\r\ntoward her.\r\n\r\nRaoul put his finger to his lips and called out, \"Who's there?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's Eli,\" said a voice through the door.\r\n\r\nRaoul's heart began hammering again, as hard as when he woke from his\r\nnightmare.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Lord, my paw,\" whispered Clarissa.\r\n\r\nShe sounded frightened--but only a _touch_ frightened, and Raoul eyed\r\nher suspiciously. Her eyes were wide, like a child trying to deny\r\nmischief after being caught red-handed. Could Eli and his daughter have\r\nplanned this?\r\n\r\nDid Eli know that Clarissa was in here? Raoul had been too drunkenly\r\ncareless to worry about who was watching when he took her upstairs last\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nFeeling a quaking in his stomach, Raoul walked over to the door. \"What,\r\nEli?\" He hoped his voice sounded strong. He no longer took pleasure and\r\npride in his nakedness.\r\n\r\n\"Thought you should know about something I heard over to the fur store,\r\nRaoul.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who's minding the furs now?\" The place was full of bundles of pelts,\r\nbeaver, badger, fox, raccoon, skunk. And valuable trade goods. Indian\r\nbucks walking in and out all the time, this time of year. Raoul had been\r\nhappy to turn most of the fur trade work over to Eli. He couldn't\r\nstomach dealing with Indians.\r\n\r\n\"I left Otto Wegner there. Raoul, there's Injuns out digging in your\r\nlead mine.\"\r\n\r\nAt once Raoul forgot his fear of being caught with Clarissa. In its\r\nplace he felt a rage so powerful his body seemed to fill up with boiling\r\noil. Indians, more Indians! Worming their way into his family, and now\r\nstealing from his mine.\r\n\r\n\"Came looking for lead, did they?\" he growled. \"We'll give them lead.\r\nRound me up a couple of good marksmen and I'll meet you down in the\r\ntaproom.\"\r\n\r\nHe heard no sound for a moment, and wondered what Eli was doing and\r\nthinking on the other side of the plank door.\r\n\r\nThen Eli's voice came, \"I'll be a-waiting for you, Raoul.\"\r\n\r\n_That gets him away from here for now._\r\n\r\nBut if Eli and Clarissa were planning to try to push him into a\r\nmarriage, he knew he wouldn't get out of this that easy.\r\n\r\nPierre bringing an Indian wife and son home, Clarissa trying to trap him\r\ninto a marriage--he began to feel as if he had walked into some kind of\r\nan ambush.\r\n\r\nAnd Indians at the mine.\r\n\r\nHe eyed Clarissa, who sat with a pillow between her bare back and the\r\nrough-hewn log wall, sheet and blanket pulled up to her shoulders. He\r\nwalked over to her to make sure he could not be heard from outside.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to have to ride out to the mine, and I'll be taking your\r\nfather with me,\" he said, keeping his voice soft. \"Wait till you hear us\r\nride away, then get out of here. And make sure nobody sees you.\"\r\n\r\nShe was still wide-eyed. \"Oh, Raoul, if he was to catch me with you he'd\r\nbeat me worse'n that Injun ever beat you.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul leaned forward and put his hand, gently but firmly, on her throat.\r\n\"If he ever finds out from you that you and I were together,\" he said\r\nsoftly, \"I'll beat you even worse than that.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the taproom on the first floor of the inn, Eli, a short, skinny man\r\nwhose thinning blond hair was turning gray, gave no sign of knowing that\r\nClarissa was in the room upstairs. Where did he think she was? Raoul\r\nwondered. Maybe he knew, but was biding his time.\r\n\r\n\"Winnebago with a bundle of beaver pelts come in this morning,\" Eli\r\nsaid. \"Said that for an extra cupful of whiskey he'd tell me a thing I\r\nmight like to know. I obliged, and he told me riding over here yesterday\r\nhe'd seen smoke rising from the prairie. He went for a look-see and it\r\nwas three Sauk bucks carrying galena out of the mine and smelting it\r\ndown.\"\r\n\r\nEli had rounded up three big men to ride out with Raoul. Levi Pope, a\r\ntall, hatchet-faced Sucker, an Illinois man, carried a Kentucky rifle\r\nthat almost came up to his shoulder. Otto Wegner, a veteran of the army\r\nof the King of Prussia, was six foot three with broad shoulders. He wore\r\nhis brown mustache thick and let it grow back over his cheeks to join\r\nhis sideburns. Hodge Hode, like Eli, was a Puke, a Missourian. Huge as a\r\ngrizzly bear, he dressed in fringed buckskins. Under his coonskin cap\r\nred hair, wild and knotted, hung down to his shoulders, and his red\r\nbeard hid three quarters of his face. Besides their long rifles, Eli,\r\nLevi, Hodge and Otto had pistols stuck through their belts, powder horns\r\nslung over their shoulders, hunting knives sheathed in pockets in the\r\nfront of their buckskin shirts.\r\n\r\nRaoul let them each have a glass of whiskey, his good whiskey, Old\r\nKaintuck from a canvas-wrapped stone jug, not the terrible-tasting corn\r\nliquor he dispensed from the barrel in the taproom. Then the five of\r\nthem went out to mount their horses in the courtyard of the trading\r\npost. Raoul rode his chestnut stallion, Banner.\r\n\r\n_My domain_, Raoul thought proudly, as he looked around. Surrounding the\r\ntrading post was a palisade twenty feet high made of logs set\r\nvertically, with a catwalk running all around it and a guard tower in\r\neach corner. From a pole atop the southwest tower flew the flag of the\r\nUnited States, thirteen stripes and twenty-four stars, and below it the\r\nflag of the de Marions' Illinois Fur Company, an arrow and a musket\r\ncrossing behind a beaver pelt.\r\n\r\nDominating the buildings inside the palisade was a blockhouse, limestone\r\nat ground level, with an overhanging second story of logs and rifle\r\nslits all around. Raoul had built it to fortify the trading post against\r\nhis memories of Checagou. Pierre and Papa might have thought it foolish\r\nexpense and effort, but where had they been when he needed them?\r\n\r\nNear the east side of the blockhouse was the inn they'd just left, a log\r\nhouse, food and drink on the ground floor and lodgings above. On the\r\nwest side, the fur store. Over in the northwest corner was the magazine,\r\na windowless cube of limestone blocks, surrounded by its own little\r\npalisade the height of a man. Here were stored the bags and barrels of\r\ngunpowder that passed through the trading post.\r\n\r\nThey rode out through the gateway, arched over by the name DE MARION,\r\nformed out of small bits of log by Raoul's brother-in-law, Frank\r\nHopkins, carpenter and printer. Raoul glanced down at the town of\r\nVictor, built on the steep slope below the trading post. From here he\r\ncould see mostly half-log roofs and clay-lined log chimneys following\r\nthe road that zigzagged across the face of the bluff. The houses all\r\nfaced west, with their backs to the limestone slope. North and south\r\nfrom the base of the bluff stretched miles of bottomland along the\r\nMississippi River. The spring floods that left the bottom some of the\r\nrichest farmland in the world also made it necessary to build almost\r\neverything on the bluff above the high-water line.\r\n\r\nRaoul pulled Banner's head around and led his little troop at a trot\r\nalong the ridge that ran east. Now Victoire came into view, the château\r\nhis father and brother had built on the edge of the prairie, its first\r\nfloor, like that of the blockhouse, of stone, its upper two stories of\r\nsquare-hewn timber. Some day, he thought, as he rode past the hill\r\ncrowned by the great house, he would enter Victoire as master.\r\n\r\nThey rode on, passing big log barns and animal sheds Raoul had helped\r\nbuild. They followed a narrow trail through fields planted in corn and\r\nwheat, through orchards, the trees as yet only a little higher than a\r\nman but already yielding apples and peaches. Farther out still, cattle\r\nand horses grazed on grassland that rolled eastward like the waves of\r\nthe ocean.\r\n\r\nFive miles from the Mississippi they came to the boundary stone with an\r\nM carved on it that marked Victoire's easternmost extent. From there\r\nRaoul could see, a good ten miles or more away, the sign of the Indians,\r\na long finger of gray smoke leaning northeastward among the fluffy white\r\nclouds. The mine entrance was at the bottom of a ravine carved in the\r\nprairie by the Peach River, and the smoke doubtless meant the Indians\r\nwere smelting lead.\r\n\r\nAfter a long ride they reached the little river. The five men reined up\r\nand tethered their horses downwind from the smoke; an Indian, it was\r\nsaid, had a sense of smell as keen as a dog's. Raoul led his men to the\r\nedge of the ravine.\r\n\r\nThey walked quietly along the ravine until they sighted Indians down at\r\nthe bottom. Sauk or Fox, Raoul saw, recognizing their shaven heads with\r\ntufts of hair in the center. One of the bucks was standing at the mine\r\nentrance holding a skin sack that appeared to be full of chunks of\r\ngalena, lead ore. The other two were adding logs to the smelter's fire.\r\nTheir six horses--three for riding and three for carrying lead--were\r\nstanding at the edge of the river about ten feet from the smelter.\r\n\r\nThe Indians' smelter was simply a square pit dug in the hillside, lined\r\nwith rocks at the bottom and filled with logs and brushwood. They were\r\nmelting down the galena, letting it flow through the rocks into a\r\nslanting trench that led to a square mold dug in the earth. Raoul\r\ncounted five pigs of lead already formed, cooled and stacked beside the\r\nmold. They'd probably been at this ever since the end of winter,\r\nthinking the mine was so far from town that no white man would notice.\r\n\r\nLead was selling at seventeen dollars per thousand pounds at the pit\r\nhead up north in Galena, the new boom town named for the ore, and if\r\nthese Indians had been working since the snow melted, they might have\r\nrobbed Raoul of as much as two hundred dollars.\r\n\r\nRaoul thought he recognized the two bucks at the smelter. Last fall they\r\nhad come to him as he was bossing the crew he'd put to work expanding\r\nthe mine before he shut it down for the winter. The Indians had claimed\r\nit was their mine. He had told them to be off, and when they hadn't\r\nmoved quickly enough, he and his men had cocked their flintlocks. Should\r\nhave killed them then.\r\n\r\nRaoul gripped the gilded butt of the cap-and-ball pistol that hung at\r\nhis waist and slid it out of its holster.\r\n\r\n\"Get them!\" he called, standing up suddenly. He stretched out his arm,\r\nsighted along the barrel of his pistol and fired at the nearer Indian\r\nstanding by the smelter.\r\n\r\nFour rifles went off at once. Raoul was enveloped in the bitter smell of\r\ngunpowder and a cloud of smoke. The Indian Raoul had aimed at jerked,\r\nfell to his knees, then collapsed face forward beside the smelter. The\r\nother one at the smelter ran for his horse and leaped on its back. They\r\nmust have all aimed at the same one, Raoul thought, cursing himself for\r\nnot thinking of pointing out targets for each man.\r\n\r\nThe third Indian had disappeared. The skin sack of galena lay beside the\r\nmine entrance.\r\n\r\n\"Dammit,\" said Raoul. \"If that redskin on the horse gets away there'll\r\nbe raiding parties coming here. Whoever digs here'll have to have eyes\r\nin the back of his head.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll put an eye in the back of _his_ head,\" said Eli as he poured\r\npowder from his measure down the muzzle of his rifle. He grinned at\r\nRaoul--two upper front teeth missing and one lower. Did he know about\r\nClarissa? Raoul still couldn't tell.\r\n\r\nThe other men were also reloading. Raoul pushed powder and shot down the\r\nmuzzle of his pistol, then took a percussion cap out of a pouch at his\r\nbelt and pressed it onto the nipple in the breach. By the time he was\r\nready to fire, the Indian was galloping down the riverbed and had\r\ndisappeared around a bend.\r\n\r\nHodge Hode, Levi Pope and Otto Wegner ran for their horses. Eli stayed\r\nwhere he was, smiling down at the rifle in his hands as if he were\r\nholding a baby.\r\n\r\n\"If we all chase after the one on horseback,\" Eli said, \"the one that's\r\nhiding will run off in the other direction.\"\r\n\r\n\"True enough,\" said Raoul. By this time Hodge, Levi and Otto had ridden\r\noff.\r\n\r\n\"Another thing,\" Eli said. \"Our boys is on the wrong side of the ravine.\r\nWhen the Injun comes out, he'll come out on the south side. By the time\r\nthey ride down and in, and up and out again, he'll be a mile away.\"\r\n\r\n\"So what do we do?\" asked Raoul.\r\n\r\n\"It's all flat land hereabouts.\"\r\n\r\nBefore Raoul could demand an explanation of that, he saw the fleeing\r\nIndian on his mount scramble out of the ravine and ride southward, just\r\nas Eli had predicted. Raoul glanced at his men as they came to a halt,\r\npuzzlement showing in their gestures. Hodge fired at the Indian, who\r\nrode on unharmed. Though Raoul would not have known what else to do, he\r\ndespised his two men for their uselessness.\r\n\r\nSoon the Indian, riding hell-bent south, was a tiny dark silhouette\r\nagainst the yellow prairie. Eli raised the barrel of his Kentucky long\r\nrifle. It was an impossible shot, Raoul thought, but he said nothing.\r\nEli seemed to be aiming slightly high, not straight at the redskin.\r\nRaoul heard the Puke suck in a deep breath through his missing front\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\nThe rifle boomed. The muzzle flash made Raoul blink, and a cloud of\r\nblue-white smoke drifted across the canyon.\r\n\r\nA long time seemed to pass with nothing happening. But maybe it was only\r\na heartbeat or two. Then the dark, distant figure threw up his arms and\r\ntoppled sideways from his horse. The horse kept running and was gone\r\nover the horizon a moment later.\r\n\r\n\"Right through his noodle,\" Eli said. \"I couldn't of made that shot if\r\nhe hadn't been riding due south. Too hard to get a lead on him _and_\r\narch the bullet just right.\"\r\n\r\nEli made it seem just a simple matter of skill, but Raoul felt as if he\r\nhad just seen a miracle.\r\n\r\nThe faces of the other men, as they climbed down from their horses,\r\nshowed as much awe as Raoul felt.\r\n\r\n\"Pretty good shooting, for a Puke,\" said Levi Pope.\r\n\r\n\"Better'n any Sucker could do,\" Eli returned genially.\r\n\r\nRaoul said, \"Otto, go get that Indian's body and bring it back here.\"\r\n\r\nOtto Wegner turned at once to remount his horse. Raoul liked the way the\r\nPrussian obeyed every order instantly.\r\n\r\nBut Hodge Hode glowered at Raoul. \"Waste of time. Coyotes and buzzards\r\nhave a taste for Injun meat.\"\r\n\r\nAnnoyed at being questioned, Raoul said, \"I don't want anybody to know\r\nwhat happened to these redskins.\"\r\n\r\nAs Otto rode off, Eli, pointing to the mine entrance, said, \"We got one\r\nstill alive. At least one.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll take care of him,\" said Raoul.\r\n\r\nEli, Hodge and Levi looked at him, surprised.\r\n\r\nEli's fine shot had not only awed him; he felt it, uneasily, as a\r\nchallenge. The law was absent in Smith County, which was the way Raoul\r\nliked it. Gave an edge to a man who could handle a rifle as well as Eli.\r\nBut now, to make sure his own word remained the closest thing to law in\r\nthese parts, Raoul felt he had to equal Eli's accomplishment.\r\n\r\nHe checked the load in his pistol. He gripped the hilt of the\r\nthirteen-inch knife at his belt and loosened it in its sheath. A\r\nblacksmith in St. Louis had made it for him, assuring him it was an\r\nexact replica of the knife designed a couple of years ago by the famed\r\nArkansas frontiersman Jim Bowie.\r\n\r\nRaoul's mouth was dry. His heart was beating so hard he thought his men\r\nmust be able to see his woollen coat quivering. His hands were cold and\r\nsweaty.\r\n\r\n\"Ain't but one way out of that mine, is there?\" said Eli. \"If we go in\r\nfour abreast he can't get past us, and it's a hell of a sight safer.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll take care of him,\" Raoul repeated. Every word Eli said against his\r\ngoing into the mine alone made him even more determined to do it. He\r\nneeded to keep Eli in line, especially if it should turn out that Eli\r\nknew about him and Clarissa.\r\n\r\n\"He might have a rifle,\" said Eli. \"Might shoot you when you walk in\r\nthere.\"\r\n\r\n\"If we all go in, one of you might get shot,\" said Raoul. \"This is my\r\nproperty.\"\r\n\r\n_And fighting for it will make it more truly my property than any\r\ngovernment grant could._\r\n\r\nBut that Indian in there--what was he armed with? Rifle, knife, bow,\r\ntomahawk? How strong was he, how fast, how skilled in fighting hand to\r\nhand?\r\n\r\n_I'm a fool to put myself through this._\r\n\r\n\"Could be more'n one in there,\" said Eli.\r\n\r\nRaoul felt the blood run hot through his veins as he thought of Pierre's\r\nbastard son, of Black Salmon, of the Potawatomi who raped and murdered\r\nHelene. His men had killed two Indians today, but there was a third\r\nwaiting in that mine, and Raoul de Marion meant to be the death of him.\r\n\r\nIgnoring Eli's warnings, he moved toward the black square of the mine\r\nentrance.\r\n\r\nHe walked slowly, pistol at waist level. He needed his knife out, too,\r\nhe decided. Even though he was right-handed, it would be better to have\r\na second weapon ready than have his left hand empty. He drew his knife,\r\ntaking heart from its well-balanced feel.\r\n\r\nHe stepped under the logs he'd set last fall to brace the entrance.\r\nShould he light a candle? No, that would make him an even better target.\r\nHe tried to pierce the blackness with his eyes; it was thick as a wool\r\ncurtain.\r\n\r\nThis was foolish, he thought. If they all went in together, the way Eli\r\nsaid, a couple of men could carry candles, and they could flush out the\r\nIndian in no time. This way, he was going to get himself killed. If the\r\nIndian had a rifle, Raoul was dead for sure. He felt an urge to back out\r\nand call the others to help him. He stood there a moment, legs\r\ntrembling.\r\n\r\nNo. He had to kill his Indian by himself. He had to show Eli and the\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nHe forced his feet to slide forward as silently as he could manage. His\r\nhesitation had given his eyes a chance to get used to the dark. He tried\r\nto remember the layout of the mine. In the dim light from the entrance\r\nhe made out the downward slope of the long tunnel. About twenty feet in,\r\nanother tunnel branched off to his left. His eyes ached as they tried to\r\nfind the enemy hiding somewhere ahead of him.\r\n\r\nHe could see nothing but black walls lined with logs to brace the\r\nceiling, a floor littered with chunks of rock. As he moved forward, the\r\ntunnel got narrower, the ceiling lower. He could almost feel the weight\r\nof the rock and earth above him; these logs could suddenly give way and\r\nthe prairie come down on him like a boot on a bug. He began to be more\r\nafraid of the mine than he was of the hidden Indian.\r\n\r\nHe came to the branch tunnel and peered into it.\r\n\r\nWith a high-pitched shriek the Indian sprang at him.\r\n\r\nRaoul glimpsed a steel tomahawk edge coming at his head. He jerked the\r\npistol's trigger and jabbed with the knife in his left hand to parry the\r\naxe blade.\r\n\r\nThe blast of the pistol deafened Raoul, and in the momentary blaze of\r\nlight he saw the face of a young Indian, distorted with anger and fear.\r\n\r\nIt was a face he hated on sight--dark skin, narrow black eyes, flat but\r\nfor a beak of a nose, shaven skull. A face like those in his nightmares.\r\nIt stayed vivid in his mind's eye when the flash of light was gone.\r\n\r\nThe Indian's war whoop ended in a cry of pain.\r\n\r\n_Got the sonofabitch!_ Raoul exulted. He'd been holding his pistol low,\r\nmust have hit the Indian in the gut.\r\n\r\nThe flash had temporarily blinded him, but reflexes honed in dozens of\r\nriverfront brawls took over. He jammed his pistol into its holster and\r\nswitched the knife to his right hand. Every fiber of him hungered to\r\nkill. He lunged forward, knife straight out in front of him. He could\r\nfeel his lips stretching in a grin.\r\n\r\nThe knife hit something solid, yet yielding. With a yell of triumph he\r\ndrove the point in, was rewarded with a scream of agony. He was\r\nbeginning to see again. The shadow facing him lifted the tomahawk. Raoul\r\njerked the knife free and swung; it chunked into the Indian's arm like a\r\nmeat cleaver. He heard the tomahawk clang on the rock floor.\r\n\r\nRaoul threw himself on the Indian, stabbing, stabbing. His enemy's body,\r\nsmaller and lighter than his, crumpled under his weight. The fingers of\r\nhis left hand dug into smooth skin and hard muscle. He felt hands\r\npushing against him, but their efforts were weak, the struggles of a\r\ndying creature. The cries and groans of pain made him eager to hurt the\r\nIndian more. It was too dark to see where his knife was going in, but he\r\nbrought it down again and again. His hands felt wet. Some of his thrusts\r\nsank deep, others were stopped by bone.\r\n\r\nA pulse pounded in his brain. It did not matter that he was fighting in\r\nthe dark; fury blinded him anyway. He forgot everything but the knife in\r\nhis hand and the soft, bloody body under him. He screamed with rage and\r\ntriumph, drowning out the agonized shrieks of his enemy.\r\n\r\nAfter a while, no more cries. The body under him did not move. Raoul lay\r\non top of the Indian, panting.\r\n\r\nHe began to think again. Carefully he slid his hand over the Indian's\r\nchest, the buckskin shirt slippery with warm blood. No heartbeat, no\r\nlifting of lungs.\r\n\r\n_By God, I did it, I killed him!_ He felt as if rockets were going off\r\nin his head, and he laughed aloud. He'd fought for his mine and spilled\r\nhis enemy's blood to make it his own.\r\n\r\n_No goddamned Indian is ever going to steal what belongs to me._\r\n\r\nHe climbed to his feet. His knees were shaking violently under him.\r\n\r\nHis head ached so badly he felt as if his eyes were being pushed out of\r\nhis skull. He realized that in the fight he'd completely lost control of\r\nhimself. He'd become a wild thing, a creature without a mind. It had\r\nhappened to him several times before, in fights that had ended with his\r\nkilling a man.\r\n\r\nThoughts of triumph that he had killed his enemy, of terror at the\r\nrealization that this fight could have gone the other way, chased each\r\nother around in his brain, but he felt even more alive and happier than\r\nhe had last night with Clarissa.\r\n\r\nSudden light dazzled him. An arrow of fear shot through him. More\r\nIndians?\r\n\r\n\"Raoul!\" It was Eli Greenglove's voice.\r\n\r\nHis eyes adjusted, and he could see Eli, Hodge Hode and Levi Pope\r\nstanding at the entrance to the side tunnel. They looked at the body at\r\nhis feet and the bloody knife in his hand, and then up at him and their\r\neyes were wide and their lips parted.\r\n\r\n_Those looks are worth as much to me as this whole mine._\r\n\r\n\"You really chopped him into mincemeat,\" Eli said. \"I'll have to get me\r\none of them Arkansas toothpicks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Get the other two bodies in here,\" Raoul said, making an effort to keep\r\nhis voice steady. \"We'll find some place to bury them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Better search the whole mine, make sure there's no more redskins,\" said\r\nEli.\r\n\r\nRaoul agreed, but he felt certain this one he'd killed was the only one\r\nin the mine. He looked down at the dead face. The Indian wasn't much\r\nmore than fifteen or sixteen years old. Good, he thought. Hadn't had\r\nlong enough to do much harm.\r\n\r\nBut why, Raoul wondered, had this young buck thrown his life away\r\nattacking him near the entrance to the mine? He'd have had more of a\r\nchance of escaping if he'd hidden deeper.\r\n\r\nMaybe he'd figured there was at least a little light to see and fight by\r\nnear the entrance. If he'd gotten Raoul, then somehow managed to get\r\naway, he'd probably have claimed the right to wear a brave's feather.\r\n\r\nThe thought of himself lying dead in the dark and his scalp hanging on a\r\npole in front of a lodge down at Saukenuk made Raoul shudder.\r\n\r\nBut it was Raoul who'd won his feather. No Indian would ever kill Raoul\r\nde Marion.\r\n\r\nAnd any redskin sluts, and any mongrel bastards, that showed their face\r\naround Victoire would have to deal with a man who killed Indians as\r\neasily as he killed any other sort of vermin.\r\n\r\nTime to have it out with Pierre.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPierre wanted to weep as he saw what was about to happen. He rushed\r\nforward and thrust out his hand to stop Raoul.\r\n\r\n\"Not the vase!\" he cried. Maman had loved it so.\r\n\r\nRaoul was too close to the mantel for Pierre to reach him in time. He\r\ngot to it in two strides and, just as Pierre had expected, seized the\r\nvase that had been in the family for four generations, had stood on the\r\nmantel ever since they built this château.\r\n\r\n\"Raoul!\" Papa cried. \"Think what you are doing!\"\r\n\r\nRaoul turned, holding the vase high over his head. He fixed Pierre with\r\nthe wide-eyed stare of a madman. His teeth flashed under his black\r\nmustache in a grimace of fury.\r\n\r\nHe dashed the vase to the flagstone floor. The white egg shape vanished\r\nwith a hollow crack, and shards scattered, some hitting Raoul's boots,\r\nothers flying into the huge stone hearth.\r\n\r\nA sudden silence filled the great hall of Victoire. Pierre felt as if\r\nhis heart had broken with the vase.\r\n\r\n_You killed Maman_, he wanted to cry out, _now you would kill the memory\r\nof her_.\r\n\r\nBut he held his tongue and hated himself for even thinking what he had\r\nalmost said. What an evil thought! How could he blame Raoul because\r\nMaman died giving birth to him?\r\n\r\n_Think what you are doing!_ Papa had cried. That was precisely what\r\nRaoul never did. Thought was for afterward, for escaping the\r\nconsequences of his actions. Now he had worked himself into a rage, lost\r\nall governing of himself, because, somehow, he had heard about Sun Woman\r\nand Gray Cloud.\r\n\r\nPierre had to try to win Raoul over, to find a way to break through the\r\nanger that divided him from his younger brother. Raoul had to be\r\npersuaded that it was only right that Sun Woman and the boy be brought\r\nhere to Victoire. If Raoul did not accept that, his rage would tear\r\ntheir family apart.\r\n\r\nBut how, in one afternoon, batter down a wall that had been building\r\nover the past dozen years?\r\n\r\nPierre realized that he was still standing with his hand held out to\r\nRaoul. He lowered it slowly, feeling his shoulders slump at the same\r\ntime. He had been reading with Papa when Raoul came in. Now he took off\r\nhis spectacles, put them in the silver case that hung from his neck by a\r\nvelvet cord and dropped the case in his vest pocket.\r\n\r\nElysée de Marion clutched the arms of his leather wing chair with\r\nclawlike hands, half rising from it. Raoul stood staring at the two of\r\nthem, panting and trembling.\r\n\r\nElysée said quietly, \"Why did you do that, Raoul?\"\r\n\r\n\"To make you listen.\" Raoul's voice was deep and strong, and it\r\nresounded powerfully against the beamed ceiling and stone walls of the\r\ngreat hall. But in its tones Pierre heard the screams of that hysterical\r\nboy whose tantrums and nightmares, after they'd finally succeeded in\r\nransoming him from the Potawatomi, had wrenched the hearts of the whole\r\nhousehold and renewed their grief over the loss of Helene.\r\n\r\nBut now that painfully thin, frightened child was a broad-shouldered man\r\nover six feet tall with a knife as big as a broadsword and a pistol\r\nstrapped to his waist. A very dangerous man. A man who, they said, had\r\nkilled half a dozen or more opponents in fights up and down the\r\nMississippi.\r\n\r\n\"We have been listening,\" Elysée said.\r\n\r\n\"Pierre hasn't,\" Raoul said resentfully. \"_You_ tell him, Papa. Tell\r\nhim he'd better leave his damned squaw in the woods where she belongs.\"\r\n\r\n_Damned squaw._ The words pierced Pierre's chest like arrows.\r\n\r\nElysée sat back down in his wing chair and stroked his jaw. He looked\r\nlike an old turkey cock, with fierce eyes, a hooked nose and a long,\r\nwrinkled neck. The leather-bound copy of Montaigne's essays that had\r\nbeen lying in his lap had slipped to the floor to join newspapers piled\r\naround his feet like autumn leaves, a mixture of local papers like Frank\r\nHopkins's _Victor Visitor_, and the Galena _Miners Journal_, months-old\r\npapers from the East--the _New York Evening Post_, the _Boston Evening\r\nTranscript_, the _National Intelligencer_ from Washington City, the even\r\nolder copies of _Mercure de France_ from Paris.\r\n\r\n\"Come here, both of you,\" Elysée sighed.\r\n\r\nHoping his father could reconcile them where he had failed so dismally,\r\nPierre went to stand before Elysée's chair. After a moment's hesitation\r\nRaoul approached too. But Pierre saw that he was pointedly keeping more\r\nthan an arm's-length distance between the two of them.\r\n\r\nElysée said, \"That's better. I can't see you when you stand far from me.\r\nThese eyes are good for very little but reading, and when I can no\r\nlonger read, I will shoot myself. And if I cannot see well enough to\r\nload the pistol, one of you must do it for me.\"\r\n\r\nAs he often did, Elysée was attempting to use humor to put out the fire.\r\nPierre glanced at Raoul to see if their father had drawn a smile from\r\nhim. But Raoul stood with arms folded across his chest, his mouth hidden\r\nunder his black mustache, his eyes narrowed. Except when he smiled--and\r\ntoday he was far from any smiling--the mustache made him look\r\nperpetually angry.\r\n\r\n\"Raoul,\" Elysée said. \"Be assured that we are listening to you. Tell us\r\nwhat has driven you to destroy one of our family treasures.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just because Pierre soiled himself with a squaw,\" Raoul demanded, \"do\r\nwe have to live with what came of it?\"\r\n\r\nPierre felt his face burn. He wanted to slap Raoul.\r\n\r\n_My life with Sun Woman was as honorable as my life with Marie-Blanche._\r\n\r\nHe forced himself to control his temper. If he became as angry as Raoul\r\nwas, this day would surely be the ruin of the house of de Marion.\r\n\r\nPierre felt a sudden twinge of pain in his belly. He fought down an urge\r\nto rub himself there. He wanted no one to know about his illness. Worse\r\nthan the pain was the fear it brought on, the chilling suspicion that he\r\nwas a dying man.\r\n\r\nFearfully he wondered what death would be like. Though Père Isaac said\r\nsuch notions were foolish, he could not help seeing God the Father as an\r\nenormous white-bearded judge, seated among the clouds. And what would\r\nthe Father's sentence be if Pierre de Marion turned his back on a wife\r\nand a son?\r\n\r\nHe wished he could tell Raoul that he thought he was dying. Then perhaps\r\nhis brother would understand why he had to do his duty to Sun Woman and\r\nthe boy. But he feared that if Raoul was aware of his weakness, he would\r\ntry to take over the whole estate at once.\r\n\r\nPraying that his brother would understand, he said, \"Ever since\r\nMarie-Blanche died, I have been thinking of Sun Woman. After five years\r\nof life together, I left her and our little son. Lately I have been\r\nseeing her and my son, Gray Cloud, in dreams. I know God wants me to\r\nmake amends to them.\"\r\n\r\nPierre felt sweat break out on his forehead and upper lip. Why must\r\nRaoul stir up such turmoil with his hatred? Couldn't Raoul understand\r\nthat not all red people were like the ones he had encountered? Pierre\r\nsaw Sun Woman in his mind, so strong and wise, holding the hand of their\r\ngrave, brown-eyed boy. How beautiful they were.\r\n\r\nElysée said, \"I do not believe that Le Bon Dieu announces his intentions\r\nin dreams, Pierre.\"\r\n\r\nAlways the cynic. Papa had read too much Voltaire.\r\n\r\nElysée turned to Raoul. \"But, Raoul, it does seem simple justice, what\r\nPierre wants to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"What about justice for me?\" Raoul came back. \"Isn't this my home as\r\nmuch as Pierre's?\"\r\n\r\nStung by Raoul's bluster, Pierre said, \"Raoul, you live more at your\r\ntrading post than you do in this home.\"\r\n\r\nTo Pierre's surprise, Raoul's face reddened, making Pierre wonder what,\r\nexactly, Raoul was doing at the trading post. It had seemed natural that\r\nhe would spend most of his time there, since Papa had given him the\r\nIllinois Fur Company when he divided his property between the two of\r\nthem. But perhaps it was not only work that kept Raoul at the trading\r\npost night after night. A woman? Pierre found himself hoping it might\r\nbe. A woman could be good for Raoul, civilize him a bit.\r\n\r\nHe had slept there last night. How, then, could he have learned about\r\nPierre's plans for Sun Woman and Gray Cloud?\r\n\r\n_Is someone in our household spying on me?_\r\n\r\nPierre turned to Raoul. \"How did you learn about this? I was going to\r\ntell you, but you found out before I could.\"\r\n\r\nPierre took some small satisfaction in seeing Raoul's cheeks flush a\r\ndeeper red, in seeing his hesitation. He had come storming in here\r\nunprepared to explain just how he knew about Pierre's plans.\r\n\r\nRaoul said, \"I overheard you and Papa talking about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Absurd! We did not speak of this till this morning. You were not here.\"\r\n\r\nCould Armand have heard, and told Raoul?\r\n\r\nArmand must certainly know about Marchette, Pierre thought. But he knew\r\nArmand would never directly attack him. Armand's ancestors had come to\r\nAmerica when this part of the country was still New France, and such\r\npeople retained a feudal outlook. The poor fellow doubtless considered\r\nhim far superior in birth and breeding. But he was capable of seeking\r\nsome kind of revenge, such as turning Raoul against him.\r\n\r\nPierre opened his mouth to chide Raoul for setting one of the servants\r\nto spy on him, but he closed it again when he saw the look of\r\nself-righteous reproach in Raoul's face.\r\n\r\nHis brother felt betrayed too. He had never stopped feeling betrayed\r\nsince the massacre at Checagou. Then how could Pierre expect him to be\r\nreconciled to what must be done now?\r\n\r\nPerhaps it would be best to leave Sun Woman and Gray Cloud where they\r\nwere. He could just send them gifts. Doubtless they were content. His\r\nown years with the Sauk and Fox had shown him what a good life they had,\r\nso simple, so closely attuned to Nature, so constantly aware of the\r\nthings of the spirit. Those years had been the happiest of his life.\r\n\r\nNo, sending gifts from afar would not be enough. It would be as if he\r\nwas hiding his Indian wife and son away, concealing his sin in the\r\nwilderness. As he had been doing all these years, to his shame. The boy,\r\nGray Cloud, was flesh of his flesh, the only child he had in the world.\r\nHe was a de Marion as much as he was a Sauk Indian. He had a right to\r\ncome here and to know what his heritage was. He had a right to know his\r\nfather, in the time his father had left to him.\r\n\r\n_I cannot face God and tell Him I turned my back on my son._\r\n\r\nAnd that beautiful Sauk way of life, what a fragile thing it was! Powers\r\nwere massing, Pierre knew, to drive them from their homeland, to force\r\nthem to choose--exile in the Great American Desert, or annihilation.\r\nKnowledge might help Gray Cloud meet that threat.\r\n\r\nFrom the depths of his chair Elysée said, \"Pierre, it is quite obvious\r\nwhat is at the bottom of this. It is distasteful to speak of wills and\r\ninheritances, but it is best to be candid. Raoul is afraid that you will\r\nmarry this Indian woman and make her son your heir in place of him. Can\r\nyou set his mind at rest?\"\r\n\r\nPierre stared at Raoul. Ten years ago, on the day of Pierre's wedding to\r\nMarie-Blanche Gagner, Papa announced that he was getting on in years and\r\nwas transferring ownership of the de Marion estate to Pierre, the older\r\nof his sons. This January, consumption had taken poor, frail\r\nMarie-Blanche, still childless. The place of Raoul, fourteen years\r\nyounger than Pierre, in the line of inheritance was now a certainty.\r\n\r\nSurely Raoul could not be afraid that Pierre would take a Sauk Indian\r\nboy who knew no other life but woodland and make him heir to the de\r\nMarion fortune. The notion was so bizarre that it had never even crossed\r\nPierre's mind. Papa, sitting in his chair by the fire day after day,\r\nreading, reading, would sometimes entertain the most ridiculous\r\nfantasies.\r\n\r\nPierre observed that Raoul looked equally startled.\r\n\r\nThen Pierre saw Raoul's expression change from surprise to dawning\r\nanger. Papa had inadvertently given Raoul a new reason to be angry.\r\n\r\nHoping to pluck out the suspicion before it took root, Pierre quickly\r\nsaid, \"My God, Raoul, I have no intention of changing my will. The boy,\r\nwho is called Gray Cloud, is my natural son, that is all. Since I have\r\nno legitimate children, you are my heir. Surely you see that.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul's black mustache drew back from his teeth. \"What I don't see,\r\nbrother of mine, is why in hell you couldn't get a proper son in almost\r\nten years of marriage with Marie-Blanche. That squaw use you up?\"\r\n\r\nAgain Pierre felt like striking Raoul. His face grew hot.\r\n\r\nElysée asked, \"How old would this--Gray Cloud--be?\"\r\n\r\nPierre frowned, subtracting dates. \"He was born in 1810. So he would\r\nhave just turned fifteen.\" He turned again to Raoul. Perhaps knowing\r\nwhat he really did have in mind for Gray Cloud would calm his brother\r\nsomewhat.\r\n\r\nHe said, \"Père Isaac, the Jesuit, visits the British Band regularly. I\r\nmake offerings to the Jesuit mission in Kaskaskia, and I've asked him to\r\nteach the boy a little English, some elementary letters and ciphering.\r\nNow I want to see Gray Cloud for myself. See what sort of person he has\r\nbecome. And I want him to know me. And, if I thought he could benefit\r\nfrom it, I might help him to be educated. I might send him to that\r\nsecondary school in New York where our cousin Emilie's husband is\r\nheadmaster.\"\r\n\r\n\"Educate him so he can take over here?\" Raoul demanded, and Pierre's\r\nheart sank. Perhaps he should not have said anything about educating the\r\nboy. He had momentarily forgotten what a disaster Raoul's year in New\r\nYork had been, what with whores, drink, money thrown away at cards,\r\nbrawls with street toughs and the police. The effort to educate Raoul\r\nhad ended when he beat his Latin teacher so badly the man was in New\r\nYork Hospital for a month. It had cost Papa a fortune to persuade the\r\nteacher not to press charges. Of course Raoul would be insulted at the\r\nsuggestions that a savage Indian boy might succeed where he had\r\ndisgraced himself.\r\n\r\n\"No, Raoul.\" Pierre shook his head vigorously. \"At the most, I might\r\nwant his mother and him to have a small bequest. Not even as much as\r\nwill go to Nicole. So little you would never miss it. Surely you would\r\nnot let greed for wealth and property come between us.\"\r\n\r\n\"I came here today to protect our family honor, and you call me greedy!\"\r\nRaoul's broad chest heaved.\r\n\r\n\"What I propose _is_ honorable!\"\r\n\r\n\"How could you consider it honorable to make Indians part of our family\r\nafter what they did to us?\"\r\n\r\nIt hurt Pierre to call those awful memories to mind. Yes, perhaps if he\r\nhad been there and suffered as Raoul had, and had seen Helene raped and\r\nmurdered, he might hate Indians as his brother did.\r\n\r\nPierre said, \"Raoul, when I was with Sun Woman I knew nothing of what\r\nhappened to Helene and you. Once the war broke out in 1812 I was in\r\neffect a prisoner and had no word from the white world. The Sauk held\r\nme for three years from the start of the war. And then, when I found\r\nout--why do you think I left Sun Woman and Gray Cloud? And never\r\nreturned, only sent messages through the priest, never tried to see\r\nthem? It was because after I learned about Helene--about what they did\r\nto you--I, even _I_, Raoul, could not be with Indians anymore. It has\r\ntaken all these years before I could face them again.\"\r\n\r\nElysée said with a frown, \"Raoul, you keep mentioning that this woman\r\nand her child whom your brother wishes to help are Indians, as if that\r\nin itself made them intolerable. Now, I could quite agree, if they were\r\nEnglishmen--\"\r\n\r\nRaoul spoke in a low, steady growl. \"Being Indians does make them\r\nintolerable. They're animals.\"\r\n\r\nPierre felt anger growing inside him. He was trying to understand Raoul,\r\nbut Raoul's insults were becoming more provocation than he could endure.\r\n\r\n\"Animals?\" said Elysée incredulously. \"Come now, Raoul. Surely you do\r\nnot believe that. The red people are as human as we are.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul laughed bitterly. \"Sure, you'd have to say they're human.\r\nOtherwise Pierre's mating with one of them would be like a half-witted\r\nfarmer mounting one of his sheep.\"\r\n\r\nSomething exploded in Pierre's brain and he heard his own cry of anguish\r\nas if from a long way off. He felt tears running from eyes blinded with\r\nfury.\r\n\r\nAnd when his eyes cleared, all he could see was Raoul's sneer. He burned\r\nto smash his fist into those so-white teeth under that black mustache,\r\nsilence that filthy tongue. He lunged forward, fist drawn back.\r\n\r\nRaoul caught his arm in an iron grip, but the force of Pierre's rush\r\nthrew his brother back against the great chimney. Pierre reached to grab\r\nRaoul's neck and slam his head against the stone.\r\n\r\n\"Stop!\" Elysée cried.\r\n\r\nThe old man stood up more quickly than Pierre had seen him do in years\r\nand pushed himself between them.\r\n\r\nSuddenly afraid that his father might be hurt, Pierre forced himself to\r\nlet go of Raoul. Every muscle in his body went rigid, and he trembled\r\nfrom head to foot.\r\n\r\n\"You must control yourselves,\" Elysée said. \"Pierre, you raised your\r\nhand against your brother.\"\r\n\r\nPierre took a step backward, still shaking. How could this father\r\nreproach _him_, after what Raoul had just said?\r\n\r\n_The voice of Reason_, Pierre thought bitterly. _He does not know there\r\nare some feelings that cannot be reasoned with._\r\n\r\nPierre realized that he was still crying. Raoul, having let go of his\r\narm, was looking at him with disgust.\r\n\r\n\"I loved Sun Woman,\" Pierre stammered. \"For him to speak of her so--to\r\nspeak so of our love--\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely,\" Elysée said, \"Raoul spoke in the heat of anger.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't take back a word,\" Raoul said in a hard, flat voice.\r\n\r\nBut, though it was hard to read the features behind that fierce black\r\nmustache, Pierre thought he saw uncertainty in Raoul's face. As if Raoul\r\nfinally understood that he had gone too far.\r\n\r\n_He drove me to try to hit him. He's never pushed me that far before._\r\n\r\nPerhaps, Pierre thought, Raoul would now apologize. Appalled at his own\r\nwords, he might seek to be reconciled.\r\n\r\n_I will make no more overtures. He meets every attempt with insults._\r\n\r\nPierre waited. He could see Raoul struggling within himself. Perhaps\r\nPapa's suggestion that he might lose his inheritance had made him\r\nrealize what consequences a rift between them could have.\r\n\r\n_Of course, I would never disinherit Raoul. There's no one else who\r\ncould manage the estate after I die. And I may be gone sooner than\r\nanyone expects._\r\n\r\nPierre saw Raoul's broad chest swell as he took a deep breath. Now,\r\nthought Pierre, surely Raoul was going to apologize and ask forgiveness,\r\nand they would work out some way that Sun Woman and Gray Cloud could be\r\nbrought here without stirring up old hatreds.\r\n\r\nRaoul said, \"Don't bring Indians into this house, Pierre, I warn you. If\r\nany Indian tries to claim he's a member of my family, I'll make him wish\r\nhe had never been born at all.\"\r\n\r\nThe pain that might one day kill him sank its teeth deep into his guts.\r\nRaoul's words seared him like a branding iron. He felt his shoulders\r\nsag.\r\n\r\nRaoul turned his back on his brother and his father, and the clump of\r\nhis hard leather boot heels echoed through the great hall.\r\n\r\n\"Raoul!\" Elysée cried. He held his hand outstretched, as Pierre had when\r\nRaoul was about to smash the Limoges vase.\r\n\r\nLooking down at those glistening white shards scattered over the\r\nflagstones, Pierre wondered what would happen when Raoul inherited the\r\nde Marion fortune. Would he destroy it in one of his rages as he had\r\nthis beautiful object that had been part of the family treasure? Or\r\nwould he use its power as he used his fists and pistol and knife, to\r\ndestroy others?\r\n\r\nThe de Marion fortune.... Once it had been a huge tract of land in\r\nnortheastern France dominated by the château of the Counts de Marion,\r\nheld by them so long that no one knew when or how they first obtained\r\nit. Just as the origin of the de Marions themselves was something of a\r\nmystery.\r\n\r\nConverted into gold, the de Marion fortune had sailed, with Elysée, the\r\nlast Count de Marion, his countess and his children, across the\r\nAtlantic. Elysée, in the early 1780s, had foreseen the bloody upheaval\r\nthat would sweep away the king and the nobility of France. He had made a\r\nfriend of the American ambassador to France, Thomas Jefferson, and had\r\nthought much about Jefferson's new nation. Their revolution was over and\r\ndone with. The de Marion fortune might thrive in those United States.\r\n\r\nAnd on the American prairie the de Marion fortune had purchased a vast\r\nnew estate and built a new château.\r\n\r\nElysée sighed and took a step toward his chair. Pierre turned the chair\r\ntoward the fire so that its wings would gather in the warmth of the\r\nsmall fire and hold it around his father's body.\r\n\r\n\"Would you consider not bringing this woman and this boy here?\" Elysée\r\nsaid as he sat down. \"To keep the peace in our family?\"\r\n\r\nPierre hesitated. For ten years Sun Woman and Gray Cloud had lived in\r\ntheir world, and he in his. Why provoke so much strife now by trying to\r\nchange that?\r\n\r\nBut Gray Cloud was the only son he would ever have, and if he left\r\nthings as they were, he would die without knowing him.\r\n\r\n\"She is my woman--in truth, my wife--and the boy is my child,\" Pierre\r\nsaid. \"Raoul has much. They have little. Raoul is wrong to cling to this\r\nhatred. To give in to him would mean abandoning these two people to whom\r\nI owe so much. As soon as the weather is a little warmer, Papa, I mean\r\nto leave for Saukenuk. And I do dread what may happen, but, yes, I still\r\nmean to come back with my wife and my son.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nStar Arrow\r\n\r\n\r\n_White Bear. My name is White Bear._\r\n\r\nThe sun, shining down through branches dotted with budding leaves,\r\nwarmed his back. He wore the knife his father had left him sheathed at\r\nhis waist. His eyes searched among the branches of the trees. He did not\r\nknow exactly what he was looking for, but Owl Carver said that he would\r\nknow it when he found it. He stopped at the base of an oak tree and\r\nlooked up.\r\n\r\nHe thought he heard something moving through the bushes on the upriver\r\nside of the island. He stopped peering at the branches and looked up at\r\nthe sky.\r\n\r\nThe black trunks of the oaks and hickories rose above him. He felt as if\r\nhe were standing in a circle of wise old men, who were there to advise\r\nand protect him. Ever since that time of sitting in the sacred cave when\r\nhis soul had gone out of his body, whenever he was by himself he never\r\nfelt alone. He felt the presence of spirits in all things--trees, birds,\r\nplants, rocks, rivers.\r\n\r\nAfter a moment's listening he heard nothing strange and went back to his\r\nsearch. He had chosen this island because he had come here many times at\r\ndifferent seasons with his mother, gathering plants for medicines. Today\r\nhe was looking for one thing. Somewhere on this island grew the branch\r\nfrom which he would cut his medicine stick. Owl Carver had carefully\r\ninstructed him.\r\n\r\n_It will call to you out of the forest. It may be of oak or maple or ash\r\nor cedar or even hickory. You will know it because it will not be like\r\nany other branch you see, and your eye will be drawn to it._\r\n\r\nA cloud drifted over the sun, and his arms and shoulders suddenly felt\r\ncold. The coldness felt strange, and he remembered that his spirit\r\nguide, the White Bear, was said to live in a very cold place. He stood\r\nstill. He felt he should wait for something to happen.\r\n\r\nA shaft of sunlight fell on the black trunk of a tree a short distance\r\nin front of him. Where the light struck the tree, a branch was growing\r\nout, pointing right at him. He might not have noticed it if the light\r\nhad not fallen in just that way.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the branch three bright bur oak leaves were growing. This\r\nwas the Moon of Buds, and the limbs of most trees bore only the many\r\nround swellings that would, as the days grew warmer, open and spread\r\ninto the first leaves.\r\n\r\nBut the three oak leaves at the end of this branch were fully grown, fat\r\nleaves with deep, irregular lobes.\r\n\r\nIt was as Owl Carver had said. This branch called out to him from the\r\nforest.\r\n\r\nHe went up to the tree, and as Owl Carver had taught him, he said,\r\n\"Grandfather Oak, please let me have your arm, to take with me to make\r\nstrong medicine for our tribe. I promise I will not hurt you, and I will\r\nleave all your other arms untouched so that you can grow strong in this\r\nplace.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a small, new branch growing out of the tree at eye level. When\r\ntrimmed and stripped it would be just the right size for a medicine\r\nstick. He would dry the leaves and keep them, too, he decided, as part\r\nof his medicine bundle.\r\n\r\nWith his knife he reverently cut the branch away from the tree trunk.\r\n\r\nA voice behind him said, \"My son.\"\r\n\r\nHe jumped, startled.\r\n\r\nAt once he recognized Sun Woman's voice. As always, a warmth flooded\r\nthrough him at the sound.\r\n\r\nStill, he was angry with himself. How could he let someone slip up on\r\nhim like that?\r\n\r\nHe turned. He looked into his mother's brown eyes, level with his. Not\r\nso long ago, he remembered, he had to look up to see into her eyes.\r\n\r\nHe saw pain tightening the muscles of her face. Her lips trembled as\r\nthey parted. Only a few times had he seen her in such distress, and his\r\nheart beat harder. What was wrong?\r\n\r\n\"You must come back to Saukenuk, my son,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"I have found my medicine stick, Mother. But now I must trim it here and\r\npeel the bark in the place where I found it. Owl Carver told me how it\r\nmust be done.\"\r\n\r\nShe swept a hand across her body to say no to that. \"It is Owl Carver\r\nwho says you must come now. Leave the stick here. The spirits will\r\nprotect it, and you can come back to it later. A man has come to our\r\nvillage. You must meet him.\"\r\n\r\nTears on her brown cheeks reflected the bright sun.\r\n\r\n\"What is wrong, Mother? Who is this man?\"\r\n\r\nAgain the hand gesture, rejecting his question. \"It is better you see\r\nfor yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you are sad, Mother. Why?\"\r\n\r\nShe turned away, the fringe of her doeskin skirt swirling about her\r\nshins.\r\n\r\nHe laid the severed oak branch at the base of the tree he had cut it\r\nfrom, and with thanks to Grandfather Oak, turned away.\r\n\r\nBaffled and apprehensive, he followed Sun Woman through the forest to\r\nthe edge of the island, where he saw her small elm-bark canoe pulled up\r\nbeside his.\r\n\r\nSilently they paddled their canoes side by side upstream along the\r\nnarrow stretch of black-green water that separated the island from the\r\nriverbank. The Rock River was in its spring flood. Paddling against the\r\npowerful current strained White Bear's muscles. He glanced over at his\r\nmother and saw with envy how easily she wielded her paddle. She seemed\r\nto know how to do everything well. But an expression of sorrow was\r\nfrozen on her face.\r\n\r\nThey left the island behind, and soon White Bear saw the hundred lodges\r\nof Saukenuk through the weeping willows, hackberries, maples and oaks\r\nthat grew along the riverbank.\r\n\r\nThey grounded their canoes on tree roots growing on the edge of the\r\nriver. Sun Woman beckoned, turned her back on him abruptly and started\r\nwalking through the woods by the riverbank. White Bear followed.\r\n\r\nThey passed two newly made graves in the shelter of the trees, mounds of\r\nearth, each marked with a willow wand with a strip of deerskin attached\r\nto it. Coming out of the woods, they walked, amidst the band's grazing\r\nhorses, through the blue-grass meadow surrounding the village. Beyond\r\nthe meadows, as far up and down the river as White Bear could see,\r\nstretched stockade-fenced fields where the first shoots of corn, beans,\r\nsquash and sweet potatoes dotted the freshly turned black earth like\r\npale green stars in a night sky.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear followed Sun Woman into the concentric rings of long lodges\r\nwith peaked roofs, built of wooden poles and walled with bark sheets,\r\nlaid out in the sacred circular pattern. Here the Sauk lived all summer,\r\nthree or four families to a lodge. But today the outskirts of Saukenuk\r\nseemed empty. White Bear was surprised to see no one at the riverbank or\r\nabout the lodges.\r\n\r\nSun Woman walked past the lodges with back straight, legs stiff, her\r\narms rigid at her sides, her head high. Never once did she look back at\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nReaching the heart of Saukenuk, he saw that all the people were gathered\r\nin the central clearing around Owl Carver's medicine lodge. As Sun Woman\r\napproached the crowd, a child spied her and tugged its mother's skirt.\r\nThe mother looked first at Sun Woman, then at White Bear, then whispered\r\nto another woman standing next to her. That woman turned, and then the\r\nwhispers spread in every direction and more and more people looked. The\r\ncrowd parted, making a path through which Sun Woman walked with her\r\nstiff stride. White Bear followed.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the pathway through the crowd sat Owl Carver and another\r\nman, side by side at the door of the sacred lodge. Owl Carver's long\r\nwhite hair spread like a snow-covered spruce tree. His chest was bare\r\nsave for his necklace of megis shells, and was painted with diagonal\r\nstripes of blue and green, the colors of hope and fear.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear slowed his steps, studying the man seated beside Owl Carver.\r\nHis heart thumped hard when he saw who it was.\r\n\r\nThis was the man he had seen in his vision with the White Bear and the\r\nTurtle. He stood still, his mouth open.\r\n\r\nThe vision-man had black hair streaked with white, tied with a ribbon at\r\nthe back. His face was dominated by a powerful beak of a nose. He must\r\nhave spent much time in the sun; his skin was tan, though not as rich\r\nand dark as the skins of White Bear's people.\r\n\r\nA beloved face caught White Bear's eye. Redbird was standing among the\r\npeople, looking not at the stranger, but at White Bear. Their eyes met,\r\nand hers were wide with worry. He wanted to take Redbird's hand and run\r\nwith her into the forest, away from all these people and from whatever\r\nmade Redbird and his mother look so miserable.\r\n\r\nAnd especially away from the thin, pale man who was now staring at him\r\nas intently as a hunter with drawn bow watches a stag.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, the pale eyes stranger had been part of the vision that had\r\ngiven White Bear his new name and put him on the path to becoming a\r\nshaman.\r\n\r\n_He must be a good man if he appeared to me with the White Bear and the\r\nTurtle. And he must be important to me._\r\n\r\n\"Sit here, White Bear,\" said Owl Carver, and White Bear walked slowly\r\ntoward him. Owl Carver gestured that he was to sit beside the pale eyes.\r\nWhite Bear felt his heart fluttering as he sat down. Owl Carver pointed\r\nto a place beside himself for Sun Woman. The four formed a semicircle,\r\nbacks to the medicine lodge, faces toward the crowd of curious people.\r\n\r\nAs was the way of the Sauk, the four sat for a long time with no one\r\nspeaking. White Bear's body grew colder and colder, and he had to fight\r\nto keep from trembling.\r\n\r\nAfter a time, White Bear turned to the stranger and saw in the gaunt\r\nface a mixture of pain and joy. The man's pupils were a strange, almost\r\nfrightening gray-blue color. From such eyes, White Bear knew, the Sauk\r\ntook their name for this man's people.\r\n\r\nAs the man looked at White Bear and then over at Sun Woman, it seemed\r\nthat his heart was glowing with happiness. But it was a happiness tinged\r\nby regret, the glow of a setting sun.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear's inner sense told him that something was hurting more than\r\nthe pale eye's spirit, was draining his life away. White Bear wished at\r\nonce that he could work a healing of this good man's body.\r\n\r\nBut why was Sun Woman so unhappy? And why was Redbird frightened?\r\n\r\nOwl Carver whispered to a small boy who stood beside him. The boy ran\r\noff.\r\n\r\nNow the shaman sat nodding his head slowly. White Bear could see that\r\nOwl Carver stood at the branching of several paths and was trying to\r\ndecide which one to take. White Bear's fear grew.\r\n\r\nOwl Carver turned to White Bear. \"This man is your father.\"\r\n\r\n_Yes!_\r\n\r\nTaught by Owl Carver that rather than puzzle over a vision it is best\r\nto let it reveal its meaning in its own time, White Bear had chosen\r\nmonths ago not to ponder who the pale eyes in the Turtle's lodge might\r\nbe. Owl Carver must have known when White Bear described the vision to\r\nhim, but thought it better not to tell him.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear turned and looked again at the man seated beside him, who\r\nraised his arms tentatively, as if he wanted to reach out to him. White\r\nBear kept his hands in his lap, and the man lowered his arms again.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear felt a strangeness, such as he had never known before. This\r\nman looked at him with love. He was certain, now, that because this man\r\nhad come today, everything was going to be changed.\r\n\r\n\"Your father is called Star Arrow,\" said Owl Carver. He turned to Star\r\nArrow and said, \"Your son is called White Bear.\"\r\n\r\n\"I greet you, White Bear,\" Star Arrow said. White Bear was glad to hear\r\nthis man speaking the Sauk language.\r\n\r\n\"I greet you, Star Arrow, my father,\" White Bear said. The word _father_\r\nfelt strange on his tongue.\r\n\r\n_Star Arrow._ He liked that name and wondered what it meant. _Father._ A\r\nshiver of joy went through him.\r\n\r\nHe spoke in the English Père Isaac had taught him. \"Good day to you,\r\nFather.\"\r\n\r\n\"My son,\" said Star Arrow in the same tongue. White Bear saw now that\r\ntears were running down his father's face, just as they had in the\r\nvision.\r\n\r\nHe heard a commotion at the back of the crowd. People were stepping\r\naside.\r\n\r\nA thrill went through White Bear as he saw that Black Hawk was coming\r\ntoward them. The leader's careworn face glowed as if he were seeing a\r\nlong-lost brother. He shifted his feather-adorned war club to his left\r\nhand and raised his empty right hand in greeting to Star Arrow. White\r\nBear was amazed. He could not remember seeing Black Hawk smile so\r\nhappily.\r\n\r\nStar Arrow raised his hand in reply. White Bear felt himself surrounded\r\nby giants--Black Hawk, Star Arrow, Owl Carver. He remembered the circle\r\nof trees he had been standing in when Sun Woman called to him.\r\n\r\n\"Star Arrow has come back to us,\" Black Hawk declared. \"It is well.\"\r\n\r\nWolf Paw, Black Hawk's oldest son, now strode down the line of people.\r\nHis presence, as always, made White Bear uneasy.\r\n\r\nSun Woman made room for Black Hawk to sit beside Owl Carver. The chief\r\nhanded his feathered war club to Wolf Paw, who sat down behind him and\r\nrested the club across his knees.\r\n\r\nThree more men pushed their way through the crowd. When they came to the\r\nfront, White Bear saw that they were three chiefs, members of the\r\ncouncil that ruled the day-to-day affairs of the Sauk and Fox in\r\npeacetime. One, Jumping Fish, was older than Black Hawk. Another, Broth,\r\nwas a deep-chested man and a well-known orator. The third, Little\r\nStabbing Chief, was a prominent member of the Fox tribe.\r\n\r\nWith a courteous gesture Black Hawk invited the three chiefs to join the\r\nsitting circle.\r\n\r\nThe nine sat quietly for a time before their people while a breeze\r\nwhistled over the bark rooftops of Saukenuk.\r\n\r\nBlack Hawk broke the silence. \"Our fathers and our grandfathers have\r\nknown many kinds of pale eyes. The French pale eyes traded with us. The\r\nBritish pale eyes made us their allies in war. But the American pale\r\neyes drive us from our land and kill us when we resist. American pale\r\neyes are not our friends. But this man, Star Arrow, we call friend. We\r\ntrust Star Arrow.\r\n\r\n\"Thirteen summers ago the British long knives made war on the American\r\nlong knives. The great Shawnee chief, Shooting Star, led braves and\r\nwarriors of many tribes to fight on the side of the British against the\r\nAmericans. We among the Sauk and Foxes who followed Shooting Star have\r\nbeen known ever since as the British Band. This man was living among us\r\nthen, seeking to trade with us and to know us better. When the war began\r\nthere were some who said, 'He is an enemy. Kill him.' And I might have\r\nsaid so, too, but I did not, because already I knew that he was a good\r\nman. We could not send him back to the Americans, but we let him live\r\namong us. We even let him share the bed of Sun Woman.\r\n\r\n\"After the war, when Star Arrow went back to his own people, he left\r\nwith us this boy, White Bear.\" Black Hawk turned to White Bear, and when\r\ntheir eyes met, White Bear trembled under Black Hawk's gaze. The chief's\r\neyes were infinitely black, like a night without stars.\r\n\r\n\"He left us another gift,\" Black Hawk said.\r\n\r\nHe reached into a beaded bag hanging at his belt. He took out a shining\r\nmetal disk on a thin silvery chain and held it up so that the people\r\ncould see it.\r\n\r\n\"Inside this disk of metal there is an arrow that points always to the\r\nnorth. Even on a day when I cannot see the sun, on a night when I cannot\r\nsee the stars, I know where the sun should be and I know where the\r\nCouncil Fire Star is, the star that does not move all night long. He\r\ngave us this magical gift. And so we give him his name among the\r\nSauk--Star Arrow. His heart is as constant as the Council Fire Star and\r\nas true as the arrow.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a murmur of assent among the people.\r\n\r\nBlack Hawk raised his hand. \"Let Star Arrow now tell us why he comes\r\nback.\" Black Hawk folded his arms.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear, his heart beating as hard as a drum in a dance, turned to\r\nthe pale eyes. Star Arrow turned his own head to look long and gravely\r\nat Sun Woman, then at White Bear.\r\n\r\nStar Arrow said, \"Chief Black Hawk, I lived with Sun Woman as her\r\nhusband, and then I left her with a son, this young man, White Bear. I\r\nwronged Sun Woman and White Bear. He should have had a father as well as\r\na mother. I went back to my people and married a pale eyes woman.\r\nEarthmaker has punished me by giving me no children by my second wife\r\nand at last taking her from me. Because of this my heart is like the\r\nashes of an old fire.\"\r\n\r\nHe held out his arms toward Sun Woman. \"Now I want to make it right.\"\r\n\r\nOwl Carver leaned forward into the circle of speakers. \"You want to come\r\nand live with us again, Star Arrow?\"\r\n\r\nAt the thought of Star Arrow returning to the band, White Bear's heart\r\nleaped with happiness. All his life he had been hoping to meet his\r\nfather, waiting for his father's return, but never believing it\r\npossible. So that his father, returning, might be pleased with him, he\r\nhad even let Père Isaac teach him things he could never use.\r\n\r\nTo have this strange new man who was so respected by the Sauk living\r\nwith him and Sun Woman--this was almost as thrilling a prospect as his\r\ndream of becoming a great shaman.\r\n\r\nStar Arrow said, \"No, I cannot stay among you. Nothing, I think, would\r\nmake me happier, but I have many things to do among my own people. I own\r\nmuch land.\"\r\n\r\nOwl Carver said, \"If your land keeps you from doing what you want, then\r\nit owns _you_.\"\r\n\r\nStar Arrow smiled ruefully. \"Owl Carver speaks truly, but I cannot\r\nchange this. I must care for my land myself, because there is no one who\r\ncan do it for me.\"\r\n\r\nStar Arrow turned to look at White Bear, who sensed a question: _Could\r\nyou be one who helps me care for my land?_\r\n\r\nAgain White Bear felt the presence of a death-with-claws that had its\r\ngrip on Star Arrow's body. He must speak to Owl Carver. Perhaps Owl\r\nCarver could tell him how to help his father.\r\n\r\nOwl Carver said, \"We know about your land, Star Arrow. You traded\r\nhonorably with us, and gave us many valuable goods, so that you and your\r\nfamily could live on that land to the north and farm it and graze your\r\nanimals on it.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is so,\" said Chief Jumping Fish. \"Star Arrow gave me a fine rifle,\r\nand he made our tribe rich with what he paid us.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear felt a chill of fear when he heard that Star Arrow lived to\r\nthe north. There was danger, it seemed, in the north. Three Fox men,\r\nincluding Sun Fish, a youth his own age who had been a playmate of his,\r\nhad gone north two moons ago to work a lead mine and had not been heard\r\nfrom.\r\n\r\nStar Arrow said, \"I have come to ask Sun Woman and White Bear to live\r\nwith me in my home.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear heard an amazed murmur from the crowd, and he himself felt\r\nhis heart drop as if he plummeted unaware into a deep pit.\r\n\r\nLeave the tribe? He could not picture it. It made no sense. Being\r\nwithout the tribe would be like trying to live without his arms or legs.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear's eyes met Redbird's. Her slanting eyes were big with fear,\r\nand he tried to tell her with a look that he did not want this. Now he\r\nunderstood why she looked so unhappy. She must have guessed what Star\r\nArrow would ask.\r\n\r\nTo leave Redbird. No longer to learn from Owl Carver. Give up hope of\r\nbeing a shaman. Leave the forest. Leave Saukenuk. He had heard that no\r\nspirits lived among the pale eyes. In the land of the pale eyes the tall\r\nprairie grass was burned away and the trees were cut down.\r\n\r\nBlack Hawk and Owl Carver looked at each other. In the glances that\r\npassed between them White Bear saw surprise, questioning, but no\r\ndisapproval. He felt his hopes sink. Would he have to fight this fight\r\nalone?\r\n\r\nNo--his mother would say no to Star Arrow.\r\n\r\nShe stood up to speak, tall and stately. She turned to Star Arrow, and\r\nWhite Bear saw love mingle with the pain in her dark brown eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I am happy to call Star Arrow husband. He has not wronged me. It is\r\nright that a man should live among his people.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear thought, _Now she will say that we must stay with our people\r\nand cannot go with him_.\r\n\r\n\"I am glad that Star Arrow remembers me and White Bear, that he comes to\r\nask us to live with him. But I cannot go. I have my work, the gathering\r\nof medicines, the healing, the teaching of what I know.\" She turned to\r\nRedbird, who smiled uncertainly.\r\n\r\nSun Woman spoke on. \"I could not look into pale eyes faces all day long.\r\nMy heart would dry up.\"\r\n\r\nIn the long silence that followed, White Bear waited uneasily. Why had\r\nhis mother not spoken of him?\r\n\r\nStar Arrow unfolded his long, thin limbs, went over and stood before Sun\r\nWoman. He put his hands on her shoulders. A sudden breeze rattled the\r\nbark walls of Saukenuk.\r\n\r\n\"I understand what Sun Woman says.\"\r\n\r\nSun Woman and Star Arrow both looked at White Bear. He felt as if the\r\nground were trembling under him. He wished it would open up and swallow\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"This young man,\" said Sun Woman. \"Your son, White Bear. Half of him is\r\nyou. It is right that he should see the pale eyes who are also his\r\npeople.\"\r\n\r\nThe earth was tilting. White Bear was falling.\r\n\r\nHis own mother--betraying him. Sending him away.\r\n\r\n\"I have always believed that Earthmaker meant some special destiny for\r\nWhite Bear,\" Sun Woman said.\r\n\r\nThe shout burst from White Bear. \"No!\" He did not even remember getting\r\nto his feet, but he was standing.\r\n\r\nHeads turned toward him. Eyes opened wide. He saw Black Hawk lift a hand\r\nto silence him, then lower it again. The three chiefs stared angrily.\r\n\r\nWords tumbled out of him. He spoke to his mother, who had turned against\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"Earthmaker meant me to be a shaman. How can I learn to be a shaman if I\r\nlive among pale eyes? If I spend many summers and winters away from the\r\ntribe I will no longer be a Sauk.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear could see the pain-taut lines in Sun Woman's face. This was\r\nhurting her, he knew that. But his anger at her burned in his chest. She\r\nwas trading his life for hers. She would stay here in Saukenuk, but she\r\nwould give Star Arrow part of what he wanted--his son. Why should he be\r\nsacrificed to make Star Arrow happy? It was she who had chosen to take\r\nthis pale eyes into her lodge.\r\n\r\nSun Woman turned to Owl Carver. \"We need to learn much more about the\r\npale eyes if we are to protect ourselves from them. Some of us must live\r\nwith them and come to understand them from within their tribe. Such a\r\none must be young enough to learn new ways. And he should be specially\r\ngifted, a favorite of the spirits.\"\r\n\r\nThen Owl Carver stood up to speak, facing White Bear.\r\n\r\n\"White Bear, listen to the words of your teacher. There is more than one\r\nway to become a shaman. Here in Saukenuk live many people of the Fox and\r\nsome of the Winnebago, Piankeshaw and Kickapoo tribes. Who says their\r\nlives are over because they live among the Sauk? If you live with the\r\ntribe of pale eyes, it will make you a man of greater knowledge. To go\r\namong them will take the courage of a warrior and more. Of knowledge, of\r\ncourage, is a shaman made.\"\r\n\r\nOwl Carver turned to Black Hawk. \"Sun Woman is right. Let the boy go\r\nwith Star Arrow. I know Earthmaker has blazed this trail for White\r\nBear.\" He crossed his arms before his chest and sat down again.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear cast about desperately for words that would answer Owl\r\nCarver. He felt helpless to fight the current that was sweeping him\r\naway.\r\n\r\n\"If Earthmaker wants this for me, how is it that _I_ do not know it?\" he\r\ncried. He went cold inside, realizing that in his desperation he was\r\ndefying Owl Carver before all the people. He was questioning Owl\r\nCarver's powers.\r\n\r\nHe wanted to say that he hoped to be the great prophet of the Sauk after\r\nOwl Carver had departed to the land of the spirits. But he did not dare\r\nsay such a thing. Earthmaker himself might punish him for such\r\npresumption.\r\n\r\n\"Did I not come back to you from the sacred cave with the very words of\r\nthe Turtle?\" he said, holding his hands out in appeal. \"Surely I will\r\nbring you other great visions if I stay with you. Among the Sauk I have\r\ngrown to manhood. Why does this man come now to tear me away from the\r\nonly tribe I have known?\"\r\n\r\nHe was surprised to see Star Arrow smile warmly at him.\r\n\r\n\"This man is your father,\" Owl Carver declared. \"You are a Sauk. A Sauk\r\nnever shirks the demands of honor. A Sauk is loyal and respectful and\r\nobedient toward his father.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am proud of my son,\" said Star Arrow. \"He speaks with power before\r\nthe people.\"\r\n\r\nAt that, a hopeless feeling swept over White Bear. Star Arrow was not\r\nfighting him, any more than water fights a drowning man. Star Arrow was\r\na current dragging him away from his people, his village.\r\n\r\nAnd the village was not trying to hold him. Sun Woman, Owl Carver, Black\r\nHawk, were pushing him out, as they would a man who was so wicked he\r\ncould not be allowed to live with the people. He felt utterly alone.\r\n\r\nWhat did he know of the pale eyes? Only the little that Père Isaac had\r\ntaught him. And that they were great land thieves. Always they were\r\nscheming to take land away from the people who had held it since the\r\nGreat River first began to flow from the Turtle's breast. Why must he\r\nlive among his people's enemies?\r\n\r\nOwl Carver sprang from his seat. He leaped at White Bear and crouched\r\nbefore him. His eyes opened wide as those of his totem bird. White Bear\r\nfelt himself pulled toward their black centers, as if they were\r\nwhirlpools in the Great River. Owl Carver's long white hair fanned out\r\nlike wings on either side of his head.\r\n\r\n\"_You will listen!_\" Owl Carver said in a soft voice of terrible\r\nintensity. \"_You will hear!_\"\r\n\r\nSilently White Bear stood looking at the shaman.\r\n\r\n\"You are the son of my spirit as much as you are the son of Star Arrow's\r\nbody. I tell you to live with this man as I told you to go to the sacred\r\ncave in the Moon of Ice. This is a far greater test for you. Going to\r\nlive with the pale eyes will be like journeying to another sacred cave.\r\nAnd you will bring back other visions.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear saw in the blackness of Owl Carver's eyes that if he defied\r\nthis decision he would lose his place in the tribe. There was no way to\r\nbreak free from the current that was sweeping him away from Saukenuk.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear felt as if something in him had broken. He held his face\r\nexpressionless. He did not want to show his hurt before the tribe. But\r\nhe knew he would soon be unable to stop himself from weeping.\r\n\r\nAmong the witnessing people he saw anguish and determination struggling\r\nin Sun Woman's face. Others looked at him only with curiosity, not\r\nsympathy. In all the people around him, the only face that shared his\r\nunrelieved wretchedness was Redbird's. His gaze met hers, and the pain\r\nthey felt together deepened his despair.\r\n\r\nBlack Hawk spoke in a low voice over his shoulder to Wolf Paw, who stood\r\nup. As he left the circle before Owl Carver's medicine lodge, Wolf Paw\r\nglanced at White Bear, and White Bear saw the light of triumph in his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nBlack Hawk held a hand out to Star Arrow. \"If we let you take White\r\nBear, you must one day let him return to us, bringing his new knowledge\r\nto help the Sauk.\"\r\n\r\nOwl Carver moved from his crouching position before White Bear and sat\r\ndown again, facing Star Arrow. \"This young man is most precious to us.\r\nThe mysteries have been told to him, and he has seen visions of the past\r\nand future.\"\r\n\r\nAt this White Bear's heart was eased a bit. The tribe did want him to\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\n_I am both red and white._\r\n\r\nAnd both his tribe and the pale eyes wanted him.\r\n\r\n_To go among the pale eyes will make you a man of knowledge_, Owl Carver\r\nhad said, and Black Hawk had agreed. Perhaps he could become a star\r\narrow, pointing the way for his people in the troubled days the Turtle\r\nhad foretold.\r\n\r\n\"I promise to keep him with me only for a time,\" said Star Arrow.\r\n\r\n_He has not long to live. That is why he can promise._\r\n\r\nAnd that meant that White Bear's time of exile from the Sauk would be\r\nshort. But knowing that brought White Bear no relief. He did not want\r\nhis father, whom he had just met, to die so soon.\r\n\r\n\"I ask one more thing,\" said Star Arrow. \"It will be harder for the boy\r\nto learn the ways of the pale eyes if he always feels the pull of his\r\nSauk people. For the first few summers and winters that he is with us, I\r\nask that he not return to you even for a visit, and that you send no\r\nmessages to him and he send none to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is much to ask,\" said Owl Carver. \"That is hard. The boy may die\r\nof longing for his people.\"\r\n\r\nStar Arrow shook his head. \"I would never let that happen. If I see that\r\nit is unbearable for him, I will send him back to you. But I will do\r\neverything I can to make him happy, and if he does not see the British\r\nBand or hear from them, the pain of parting will go away sooner.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand what Star Arrow says,\" said Black Hawk. \"It is granted.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear sat down slowly, feeling as if he had been mortally wounded.\r\nNever to have a word from his mother or from Redbird--how could he bear\r\nit?\r\n\r\nStar Arrow continued, \"He will go to a fine school in the East. And when\r\nhe has learned all he can learn, I will send him back to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let it be done,\" Black Hawk said.\r\n\r\nWolf Paw came through the crowd, holding up in both hands a calumet, a\r\nsacred pipe. Its hickory stem was as long as a man's arm, wrapped in\r\nblue and yellow bands, and its high, slender bowl was of dark red\r\npipestone, quarried in a valley far to the west.\r\n\r\nBlack Hawk took the pipe from Wolf Paw and filled the bowl with tobacco\r\nfrom a beaded pouch at his waist. Owl Carver went into his lodge, and\r\nbrought back a burning twig that Black Hawk used to light the pipe.\r\n\r\nBlack Hawk said, \"By the smoking of the sacred tobacco let all these\r\npromises be sealed.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear went cold as he saw the light gray smoke curl up from Black\r\nHawk's pipe and smelled its sweet scent. Once he put the pipe to his\r\nlips and drew the smoke into his mouth, he would be bound to go with\r\nStar Arrow as firmly as he was bound to the Sauk tribe.\r\n\r\nHolding the pipestem with one hand in the middle and the other at the\r\nend, Black Hawk ceremoniously drew on the pipe and let a cloud of smoke\r\nout of his mouth. He handed the pipe to Star Arrow, who fixed his gaze\r\non White Bear and did the same. Next the pipe went to Owl Carver, who\r\ntook the single puff that bound him to the agreement. Owl Carver took\r\nthe pipe in turn to Jumping Fish, Broth and Little Stabbing Chief. Each\r\npuffed on it, bearing witness.\r\n\r\nThen Owl Carver walked over to White Bear and handed him the pipe.\r\n\r\nTrembling with fear that what he was about to do might be the ruin of\r\nhim, White Bear took the pipe in his hands. His fingers felt the ridged\r\nwrappings and the smooth, warm stone of the bowl. He had never smoked a\r\nsacred pipe before.\r\n\r\nHe could hand the pipe back to Owl Carver and refuse. But he knew that\r\nthis had gone so far that if he did that, not only would he never be\r\naccepted as a shaman, he might not even be accepted as a Sauk.\r\n\r\nHe wanted to look at Redbird, but he dared not. He looked instead at Sun\r\nWoman and saw her eyes warm with the wish that he would smoke the pipe.\r\n\r\nHe put the calumet to his lips and pulled the hot smoke into his mouth.\r\nIt burned his tongue and the insides of his cheeks. He took the pipe\r\naway and held the smoke for a moment, then puffed it out. As he did so,\r\na sigh went up from the watchers.\r\n\r\nBlack Hawk was standing before him. White Bear handed the pipe up to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"May you walk this path on which we send you with courage and honor,\"\r\nBlack Hawk said.\r\n\r\nHe turned to the people. \"This council is at an end.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear knew he could not hold back his tears any longer. He sprang\r\nto his feet and blindly hurled himself into the crowd that was already\r\nbeginning to disperse. He felt a hand on his arm, but he pulled away\r\nfrom it.\r\n\r\nHe began to run. He ran through Saukenuk, through the meadow, into the\r\ntrees by the river's edge. He ran past the graves. He ran with the hard,\r\nsteady stride of one carrying a message.\r\n\r\nBut a messenger did not run sobbing, with tears streaming down his\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\nIn the Ancient Grove\r\n\r\n\r\nRedbird watched, an aching, empty place in her chest, as White Bear\r\ndisappeared into the woods at the edge of the Rock River.\r\n\r\n\"What a fool!\" Water Flows Fast, standing nearby, had spoken. \"The pale\r\neyes have steel knives and blankets and big sturdy lodges that are\r\nalways warm and never leak. They always have enough food. I would be\r\nhappy to go live with a pale eyes if he asked me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is your prattling tongue never still, woman?\" said her husband, Three\r\nHorses.\r\n\r\n\"It was my prattling tongue that agreed to marry you.\"\r\n\r\nRedbird had no heart to listen to them bicker.\r\n\r\n\"Let me through!\" she cried, and the crowd parted before her.\r\n\r\n\"Where are you going?\" cried her mother. \"It is shameful to run after\r\nhim.\" She grabbed Redbird's sleeve. \"All the people will laugh at you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me go!\"\r\n\r\nAs Wind Bends Grass pulled at her, Redbird's eyes met those of Wolf Paw,\r\nstanding beside his father, the war chief. He glared at her. She knew\r\nhe, too, wanted to tell her not to run after White Bear. But if he\r\nshowed that he cared that much, the people would make fun of _him_.\r\n\r\nShe turned her back on all of them--Wind Bends Grass, Wolf Paw, Black\r\nHawk, Owl Carver--and began to run.\r\n\r\nWhen she reached the riverbank she saw no sign of him. For one\r\npanic-stricken moment she thought, _Did he throw himself into the\r\nriver?_\r\n\r\nThen, downriver, she saw a canoe gliding over the glistening water. He\r\nwas paddling hard and was almost out of sight around a bend.\r\n\r\nHer own small bark canoe, on which she had painted a bird's wing in red,\r\nlay a short distance down the riverbank. She pushed it into the water,\r\njumped into the rear and seated herself in the middle. The canoe's\r\nbottom scraped over the riverbank as she pushed off with her paddle.\r\n\r\nShe stayed a distance behind White Bear, just close enough to keep him\r\nin sight. He might not want her to follow him. She could not guess what\r\nwas in his mind right now.\r\n\r\nWhat would she do when she caught up with him? She had hoped to marry\r\nhim, if not this summer, then the next. Ever since she was a small child\r\nshe had found him endlessly fascinating. More so than ever since his\r\nreturn from his spirit journey. Nothing, she thought, would make her\r\nhappier than living with him. Sun Woman had told her all about what\r\nhappens when a man and a woman lie down together--knowledge that Wind\r\nBends Grass had insisted that she did not yet need. It sounded painful,\r\npleasurable, frightening and exciting. She had looked forward to lying\r\ndown with White Bear.\r\n\r\nBut now she was going to lose him. How could Sun Woman send her own son\r\naway from the tribe?\r\n\r\n_And send him away from me._ Redbird felt more hurt than if her own\r\nmother had turned against her.\r\n\r\nAnd did White Bear truly mean to go with the pale eyes? He had smoked\r\nthe calumet. He must.\r\n\r\nThe current carried her canoe through the water, brown with silt caught\r\nup in spring flooding, almost faster than she could paddle. Ahead the\r\nriver divided, flowing around an island near the right bank, thick with\r\ntrees. White Bear turned into the narrow channel that ran between island\r\nand shore, and she backpaddled to slow herself and watch.\r\n\r\nHis canoe rounded a huge fallen tree, whose exposed roots clutched at\r\nthe island's shore like the fingers of a drowning man, and disappeared\r\nbehind the trunk.\r\n\r\nShe let her paddle drag in the water, first on one side then on the\r\nother, holding her canoe back until he had time to land. Then she glided\r\ninto the narrow channel and around the dead tree.\r\n\r\nHe had drawn his canoe up in a small sandy cove, and was gone. She\r\nlanded on the patch of sand beside his canoe and pulled her canoe\r\npartway out of the water.\r\n\r\nShe listened, and for a moment heard nothing but the wind in the trees.\r\nA redbird, her namesake, trilled long and loud, and another answered\r\nfrom a more distant tree.\r\n\r\nThen she heard a human voice. No words, just an outcry. A cry of pain.\r\n\r\nShe plunged into the forest that covered the island, pushing her way\r\nthrough the shrubbery toward the sound of his voice.\r\n\r\nHe was sobbing so loudly that she was sure he could not hear her coming.\r\nShe had heard a man sob like that once before, a dying hunter whose leg\r\nhad been torn to shreds by a bear.\r\n\r\nShe moved through some trees and saw him. He was sitting with his back\r\nagainst the big black trunk of an oak. He was in a grove of trees so big\r\nand so old that little grew in their heavy shade, and there was an open\r\nplace to sit. The season was so young that their branches were still\r\nalmost bare, and she could see White Bear clearly in the afternoon\r\nsunlight. He held a severed tree branch in his lap. His eyes were\r\nsqueezed shut and his lips were drawn back from his teeth, and his cries\r\nof pain came one after another.\r\n\r\nShe stepped out of the bushes into the grove. He looked up, and the face\r\nhe showed her was so twisted that she could not tell whether he saw her.\r\nHe went on sobbing hoarsely.\r\n\r\nHer heart hurt to see him suffer so. She sat down beside him.\r\n\r\nFor a long time she listened to him weep, waiting for a chance to speak\r\nto him.\r\n\r\nShe looked at the branch he was holding. It was almost as long as her\r\narm, and, surprisingly, it had leaves at its tip, even though this was\r\nonly the Moon of Buds. He clutched it as a child clutches a doll for\r\ncomfort.\r\n\r\nGradually his weeping subsided. She reached out very carefully and\r\npatted his shoulder lightly. When he did not pull away, she rested her\r\nhand on him. She eased herself closer until they were pressed together\r\nside by side, and she slid her arm around his shoulders and held him\r\ntightly.\r\n\r\nAt first she felt no answering movement. He seemed only half alive. She\r\nwondered if he knew she was here. Then his head dropped to her shoulder.\r\nShe felt the weight of his body yielding to her.\r\n\r\nShe put her other arm around him. She held him as if he were her child.\r\nIn spite of his sorrow and her own, it was a great happiness to hold him\r\nlike this.\r\n\r\nHe sighed and wiped his face with his hand. She stroked his cheek,\r\nbrushing away the tears.\r\n\r\nShe wanted to talk to him, but waited for him to speak first.\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing I can do,\" he said. \"I must go with Star Arrow, my\r\nfather.\"\r\n\r\nShe studied his face as he stared off into the forest. She could see now\r\nthe features of his father in him. There had always been something odd\r\nabout his eyes, but she had never been quite able to decide what it was.\r\nNow she saw that they were rounder than most people's. They were shaped\r\nlike his father's. His nose was thin and bony, with a high arch, and\r\nsharp at the end, like the beak of a bird. His eyebrows were thick,\r\nblack and straight across. His chin was pointed. She loved the\r\nstrangeness of his face.\r\n\r\nShe said, \"When it gets dark we could go back to the village and fill\r\nour canoes with food and blankets and tools and weapons. There will be\r\nfeasting tonight for Star Arrow. Everyone will sleep soundly after that.\r\nWe could cross the Great River tonight, and tomorrow we could be far\r\naway.\"\r\n\r\nHe stared at her. \"But I do not _want_ to leave my people.\"\r\n\r\nShe had not thought that far ahead, about what it would be like to be\r\naway from Owl Carver, Iron Knife, Sun Woman, her sisters, her mother,\r\nall the others. Yes, it would be a great loss. But she could stand the\r\npain, she thought, if she were beside White Bear.\r\n\r\n\"But we would have each other. Would it not hurt you less if you had me\r\nwith you?\"\r\n\r\nHe did not answer at once, and that made her feel as if a rough hand had\r\nsqueezed her heart. But then he smiled at her, and she felt better.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, if I could share my life with you, the pain of leaving Saukenuk\r\nwould be less.\" Then his face darkened. \"But we could not live on our\r\nown. A man or a woman cut off from their tribe can no more be happy than\r\na flower after it is picked can continue to grow. And I would have\r\ndishonored the promise I made with the sacred tobacco. The spirits would\r\nturn their backs on me. My mother and Owl Carver say that if I go with\r\nStar Arrow, I may learn things that would help our people.\"\r\n\r\nShe was thunderstruck to realize that he actually wanted to go with Star\r\nArrow. Then what was all this weeping for?\r\n\r\nHe did not care for her as much as she did for him. That made her angry.\r\nShe pushed herself a little apart from him.\r\n\r\n\"I see that I have been a fool to chase after you, just as my mother\r\nsaid. It means more to you to go and live with the pale eyes than it\r\ndoes to have Redbird as your woman.\"\r\n\r\nHis eyes widened. \"We have never before today spoken of this, you and\r\nI.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did we have to speak?\" She felt herself getting angrier and angrier.\r\n\"Why do you think I went looking for you when you went on your vision\r\nquest? Why do you think I followed you from the village today? And why\r\ndid I say I would go with you across the Great River? Yes, I did want to\r\nbe your woman. But you do not want me. You want to go away with this\r\npale eyes father of yours, and maybe you want to take a pale eyes woman\r\nfor yourself.\"\r\n\r\nHis mouth as well as his eyes opened up in amazement. \"I have never even\r\nseen a pale eyes woman. How could I want one? I do want Redbird to be my\r\nwoman. And I weep at leaving Saukenuk because I must leave you.\"\r\n\r\nAgain she reached out to him, putting her hands on his arms. \"I would\r\nrather be cast out of our tribe than lose you.\"\r\n\r\nHe shook his head. \"We do not have to lose our people or each other. It\r\nwas part of the promise sealed with sacred tobacco that I am to come\r\nback. If we ran away now, Earthmaker would be angry with us.\"\r\n\r\nShe moved closer to him. She had seen Earthmaker in dreams. He was\r\ntaller than the tallest tree, and he carried a great war club with a\r\nball-shaped rock at the end of it and looked much like Black Hawk, with\r\na long black lock of hair coiling down from the top of a shaved head.\r\n\r\n\"I wish I could meet and talk with the spirits, as you have,\" she said.\r\n\"Sometimes I think I do meet them, in dreams.\"\r\n\r\n\"It can be dangerous to meet with the spirits,\" he said. His eyes seemed\r\nto be looking into the distance. He had seen so many things she had not.\r\nIt was unfair, she thought sadly.\r\n\r\nShe had gone out to him in the bitter cold when the world was an endless\r\nwhite waste. She might have frozen to death. She might have been\r\npunished by drowning in the icy river. She had risked almost as much as\r\nhe had.\r\n\r\n\"I do not say that I am as strong as White Bear, or as worthy to speak\r\nwith the spirits,\" she said. \"I only wish I had a chance to.\"\r\n\r\nHe took her hands in his and looked deep into her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"The real danger of a shaman's vision is not to the body.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the real danger?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not want to come back.\"\r\n\r\nShe felt a cold wind blowing across her neck, as if spirits had quietly\r\nentered this grove with them and were standing about them, listening to\r\nthem, judging them.\r\n\r\n\"It is so wondrous,\" he said in a voice so low she had to strain to hear\r\nit over the wind whispering in the tree branches. \"You are there with\r\nthem. The White Bear, the Turtle. You see them, talk to them. You see\r\nthe Tree of Life, the crystal lodge of the Turtle and the spirits of all\r\nliving things. Why would anyone want to return?\"\r\n\r\nRedbird shivered. But she still envied him.\r\n\r\n\"Your hands are cold,\" White Bear said, and he put his arm around her\r\nand drew her close to nestle on his chest. She slid her hands under the\r\nleather vest he wore and felt the smooth warmth of his skin and the\r\nfirmness of his muscles. How powerful his arms were around her. She\r\nthanked Earthmaker that White Bear had found the inner strength to\r\nreturn from that other land.\r\n\r\nA new thought occurred to her. \"What if you find that the land of the\r\npale eyes holds you fast? Then you will never come back to me, and to\r\nthe Sauk you will be dead.\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled gently and patted her shoulder. She pulled herself closer to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"Can the land of the pale eyes, altogether without spirits, hold me,\r\nwhen the spirits themselves could not?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not think so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can the land of the pale eyes hold me, when Redbird is not in it? _I_\r\ndo not think so.\"\r\n\r\nHer body seemed to be melting. She wanted to flow together with White\r\nBear as the Rock River flowed into the Great River.\r\n\r\nHis arms tightened around her. Then he raised his hand to brush the\r\nfringe of hair that fell over her forehead.\r\n\r\nShe moved against him until her cheek touched his. Slowly she slid one\r\nside of her face against his, then the other side. A hunger filled her.\r\nIt was almost as if she wanted to devour White Bear, but all she could\r\ndo was touch his smooth cheek with her fingertips.\r\n\r\nHis nostrils flared and his lips parted and she could hear his\r\nbreathing. His hands were roaming over her body, awakening powerful\r\nfeelings wherever he touched her, making her want more.\r\n\r\nHow did they come to be lying down? They must have moved without\r\nrealizing it. She could see, feel and think only of White Bear. Her head\r\nwas pillowed on his arm and her face was pressed against his. With his\r\nfree hand he caressed her, seeking her flesh under her jacket and skirt.\r\nHis hand became bolder, plucking at the laces that held her clothing\r\ntogether, baring places that only a husband should look at as he was\r\nlooking now. And touching those places, sending ripples of delight all\r\nthrough her.\r\n\r\nAnd she wanted him to do that. She felt no shame or fear, only\r\nhappiness. She let him do whatever he wanted. She helped him. She moved\r\nher hands also, to touch more of him. Her hand found the oak branch that\r\nhe had been holding just before she sat down with him. She put the\r\nbranch aside and let her fingers feel the hardness pushing against his\r\nloincloth; he was ready to come into her in the way that Sun Woman had\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\nShe could still stop him if she wanted to. She knew him and trusted that\r\nhe would not do anything she did not want.\r\n\r\nBut she wanted this. She wanted his hand to go on skillfully preparing\r\nthe way for him. She wanted this golden glow inside her to fill her more\r\nand more. This was happiness, and she was climbing toward a greater and\r\ngreater happiness. She felt him move, and all at once her hand was not\r\non his loincloth, but on his hot flesh. She wanted to open herself up to\r\nthe part of him she held so tightly.\r\n\r\nThen he was upon her, and she felt a sudden stabbing pain. She cried\r\nout. Almost at once his cry of pleasure followed on hers and his hips\r\nthrust forward violently and she felt him filling her. He let out a long\r\nsigh and relaxed, lying on top of her, resting all of his weight on her.\r\n\r\nI am like the Turtle holding up the earth, she thought.\r\n\r\nThere had been mounting pleasure until her moment of pain. Now there was\r\nan ache and a faint memory of the good feelings. She wanted more\r\npleasure. Sun Woman had told her it would hurt only the first time. And\r\nthat from then on it would be better and better.\r\n\r\nSlowly he withdrew from her and they lay on their sides looking at each\r\nother. His eyes were huge right before her face.\r\n\r\n\"For a moment,\" he said softly, \"I felt as I did when I walked on the\r\nbridge of stars.\"\r\n\r\nShe thought of asking him whether it made him so happy that he would\r\nstay with her now instead of going to the country of the pale eyes with\r\nhis father. But she knew what his answer would be, and that his saying\r\nit would only hurt him and her.\r\n\r\nShe said, \"It was Sun Woman, your mother, who told me about this--about\r\nwhat men and women do together.\"\r\n\r\nHe laughed. \"It was also she who told me.\" His face reddened. \"I feel as\r\nif my mother were here watching us.\"\r\n\r\nIt was Redbird's turn to laugh. \"What would she see that she did not\r\nknow about already?\"\r\n\r\nHe shook his head. \"I would not want anybody to see us doing that.\"\r\n\r\n\"The spirits watch us.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is not the same. They watch everything, so it is not special to\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it special to you?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes. Something has passed between us. I have given a part of myself\r\nto you. And I have a part of you too. Now, even if I must leave you, we\r\nwill still be with each other.\"\r\n\r\nShe did not want to hear him speak of leaving. She wanted to stay here\r\nwith him in this grove of ancient trees forever. When she had spoken to\r\nhim of going off and being alone together, this was what she imagined it\r\nwould be like. But then a dark thought crossed her mind.\r\n\r\n\"White Bear, they might send people looking for us. They might catch us\r\ntogether like this.\" Anxiously she started to pull her clothing\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nHe sat up beside her and put his hand over hers. \"I do not think anyone\r\nis coming.\" He sounded so sure that she thought he must be speaking as a\r\nshaman.\r\n\r\n\"They know I will come back to the village,\" he added. \"They saw me\r\nsmoke the calumet. And in a few days I will leave with Star Arrow.\"\r\n\r\nHe said it with such finality that the sun seemed to go out.\r\n\r\n\"And so there is time,\" he said, \"If you want ...\" and guided her hand\r\nto touch him. To her joy she felt him strong in his readiness to be\r\nwithin her again. This time, she was sure, it would not hurt. She would\r\nknow the full delight that Sun Woman had told her of. The afternoon\r\nsunlight slanting through the budding branches was warm again, bathing\r\nher and making her feel joyful and free.\r\n\r\nTheir flowing together lasted longer this time, and gave her all the\r\nhappiness she had hoped for.\r\n\r\nAnd it came to her, as they lay peacefully side by side afterward, that\r\nthis might have happened someday, but it would not have happened today\r\nif Star Arrow had not come to claim his son.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\nRaoul's Mark\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the fourth day of their journey north from Saukenuk\r\nalong the Great River, when the sun was halfway up the sky, White Bear\r\nand Star Arrow emerged from a forest into a prairie. To their right were\r\ngentle hills covered with new green buffalo grass and prairie flowers of\r\nevery color. To their left the hills stood taller, then dropped suddenly\r\nto the Great River. White Bear saw a large boat with great white wings\r\nabove it to carry it along.\r\n\r\nStar Arrow brought his tall black stallion to a sudden halt and climbed\r\ndown, gesturing to White Bear to dismount from his brown and white pony.\r\n\r\n\"Look at this stone,\" Star Arrow said, pointing to a large gray rock\r\nthat stood upright on the edge of a bluff overlooking the river.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear saw carving on the rock and, remembering Père Isaac's\r\nlessons, recognized it as the pale eyes' letter M.\r\n\r\n\"M for de Marion,\" said Star Arrow. \"We are now on land belonging to the\r\nde Marion family. You see no fences here because we could not cut enough\r\nwood to fence off all our land. There is so much of it.\"\r\n\r\nHe reached out and rested his hand on White Bear's shoulder, his fingers\r\nsqueezing through the buckskin shirt. \"But before we come to the place\r\nwhere I live, and where you will live, we must speak of names. Among the\r\npale eyes I am called Pierre de Marion. My full name is Pierre Louis\r\nAuguste de Marion.\"\r\n\r\nHe made White Bear say \"Pierre de Marion\" after him.\r\n\r\n\"According to our custom you should call me Father,\" Star Arrow said,\r\nsaying the word in English. White Bear already knew it.\r\n\r\n\"Now I will tell you what your name will be among the pale eyes.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear pulled free of Star Arrow's hand and took a step backward.\r\n\r\n\"I already have a name. I was born Gray Cloud because I am neither white\r\nnor red.\" He could hear reproach in his voice, though he had not meant\r\nto sound that way. \"But now I am White Bear. That is the name given me\r\nby the shaman Owl Carver after my spirit journey. I must keep that\r\nname.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you will keep that name, son. You will always be White Bear. But,\r\njust as I am happy to have the British Band call me Star Arrow, so you\r\ncan have a pale eyes' name. One that tells pale eyes when you go among\r\nthem who you are--that you are a member of the de Marion family--that\r\nyou are my son.\"\r\n\r\n_He is proud that I am his son._ White Bear's anger faded and he felt a\r\nwarmth toward this man who wanted to give him a name. He decided that if\r\nStar Arrow could have two names, so could he.\r\n\r\n\"What is my pale eyes' name to be, Father?\"\r\n\r\nStar Arrow put his hand on White Bear's shoulder. \"I wish you to be\r\ncalled Auguste de Marion. Auguste is a very old name. It means\r\n'consecrated,' a sacred person, and that is a good name for one who has\r\nseen a vision and wishes to be a shaman. Say it after me. Auguste.\"\r\n\r\n\"O-goose.\"\r\n\r\nAs they rode on through the de Marion lands, people called out from\r\ncabins. Mounted men, who saluted Pierre with a wave of their hands, rode\r\namong herds of cattle and horses.\r\n\r\n_Dozens of horses!_ Auguste thought, realizing he was seeing wealth that\r\nwould amaze any man of the British Band.\r\n\r\nFarther along they passed fields fenced off with logs split in two and\r\npiled one on top of the other. Sheep roamed over low hills and cropped\r\nthe prairie grass to its very roots. Inside a smaller plot huge gray and\r\npink pigs rolled in mud beside a pond.\r\n\r\nThey passed fields planted with crops. The whole village of Saukenuk\r\nwith all the farmland around it would fit into one of those fields. He\r\nrecognized one crop, corn. Corn as far as he could see. How much corn\r\ncould the de Marions eat? They must be a huge tribe.\r\n\r\nAs they rode along, Pierre said, \"One more thing for you to know,\r\nAuguste. You will meet the rest of your family today--your grandfather\r\nand your aunt, my sister.\" He stopped his horse. Auguste reined up his\r\npony and waited. Unhappiness dragged down the lines in Pierre's face.\r\n\r\n\"I must tell you that I also have a brother, your uncle, who--\" He\r\nhesitated. \"Who may not be friendly to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" Auguste asked.\r\n\r\n\"Thirteen summers ago another sister of mine and he were captured by the\r\nPotawatomi during the war between the British and the Americans. My\r\nsister was murdered by them. Raoul, my brother, suffered greatly until\r\nwe found him and ransomed him. He hates not just the Potawatomi, but all\r\nred men. He did not wish me to bring you back here to our home.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not understand,\" said Auguste. How could a man hate all tribes\r\nbecause of what the men of one tribe had done to him? Again he realized\r\nwhat a mystery the pale eyes were, and he felt fear.\r\n\r\nPierre said, \"He probably will not be there when we arrive. I had to\r\ntell you about Raoul, but I do not want you to be afraid of him.\"\r\n\r\nBut he _was_ afraid, he told himself as they rode on. His belly felt\r\nhollow, and his heart beat faster than his pony's trotting hooves. He\r\nwas afraid of the pale eyes and their strange ways. He felt more fear\r\nnow than he had when he walked on the bridge of stars with the White\r\nBear.\r\n\r\n\"There!\" Pierre suddenly held out his hand. Auguste's eyes followed the\r\ngesture, and his mouth dropped open.\r\n\r\nWhat at first he thought he saw was a forest of trees covered with snow.\r\nIn their midst something rose like a great gray hill. Snow in the Moon\r\nof Buds? Perhaps the pale eyes did have a magic of their own.\r\n\r\nAs they rode closer, the snow on the trees turned into flowers. He had\r\nseen wild apple trees in bloom and knew that many trees flowered around\r\nthis time. But these trees were all planted in straight rows, and each\r\none was a mass of white blossoms.\r\n\r\nWhat he had thought was a gray hill was the biggest lodge he had ever\r\nseen. He jerked the reins of his horse to stop, so that he could sit and\r\nwonder at what he was seeing. He felt Pierre stop beside him.\r\n\r\nThe great lodge seemed to be made of three or four lodges all joined\r\ntogether with one central building higher than all the rest. Its high\r\npeaked roof was of logs split in half with the flat sides turned\r\noutward. The lower part of the lodge was made of stones, the upper part\r\nof logs.\r\n\r\nDread filled him, seeing that these people could do so much. They could\r\nhold so much land that a rider needed half a day to cross from edge to\r\ncenter. They could make the land obey their wishes, fence it, fill it\r\nwith animals, plant huge fields with crops, enjoy a forest of flowering\r\ntrees. And in the very center of all this they could make a lodge\r\ngigantic enough to hold a hundred families.\r\n\r\nThe pale eyes could do anything. They were magicians so mighty as to\r\nmake a shaman like Owl Carver look childish. How could he ever hope to\r\nknow all that they knew?\r\n\r\nDespair crushed him. He wanted to see no more.\r\n\r\nPierre patted Auguste's pony on the neck, and the little horse started\r\nforward again. Numbly, Auguste felt himself being led toward the great\r\nlodge, his pony's hooves falling softly on white petals.\r\n\r\nPierre pointed proudly. \"We call our house Victoire.\"\r\n\r\nCloser and closer they came until the house blocked out part of the sky.\r\nIt was gray, the logs it was built of having weathered. Auguste saw that\r\nthere were many smaller buildings scattered around the giant\r\nlodge--smaller only compared to the huge one in the center. Some of the\r\nsmaller houses were connected to the great one by sheltered walkways.\r\nThe smallest was much bigger than the biggest lodge in Saukenuk.\r\n\r\nIn a moment they would emerge from among the flowering trees. Auguste\r\nsaw a log fence ahead. The fence surrounded a low hill covered with\r\nclose-cropped grass, leading up to the house. One large old maple tree\r\nshaded the south side. He checked his pony. He could go no farther.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" Pierre asked him.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot,\" Auguste said. \"I cannot go there.\" He felt a quaver in his\r\nvoice and his lips trembling, and he held himself rigid.\r\n\r\n\"Why not, Auguste?\" Pierre said softly.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know what to do here. I have never seen such a place as this.\r\nI will do foolish things. All those people will laugh at me. You will\r\nnot want me for a son.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us wait,\" said Pierre. \"Get down from your horse.\"\r\n\r\nBiting his lip, Auguste dismounted.\r\n\r\n\"We shall sit here,\" said Pierre. They sat, facing each other. Auguste\r\nsaw people approaching through the straight rows of trees. Pierre saw\r\nthem, too, and waved them away.\r\n\r\nThey sat for a long time in silence while their horses grazed nearby.\r\nAuguste held his misery in until he felt calmer.\r\n\r\nHe looked at Pierre and nodded to say that he was in control of himself.\r\nPierre nodded back. Auguste looked at the petal-covered ground, feeling\r\ncrushed.\r\n\r\n\"All this is strange to you,\" Pierre said.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Auguste.\r\n\r\n\"And it is not foolish to fear. There are some people here who will hate\r\nyou just because you are a red man. There are people who will be afraid\r\nof you. But there are dangers in the life you come from--fire and flood,\r\nsickness, bears and wolves, the Sioux and Osage, enemies of your people.\r\nYou fear those things, but you have been taught how to live with those\r\ndangers. There are other people here, people like myself, who will care\r\nfor you and protect you and teach you how to live with the dangers of\r\nthe pale eyes' world. You must come to know these people who will help\r\nyou. I want you to be glad you came from Saukenuk to Victoire.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste did not answer. They sat in silence for a while. Then Pierre\r\nspoke again.\r\n\r\n\"The pale eyes are here, Auguste, and you must learn to live with us.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste sighed and settled down again. He listened to the buzzing of\r\nlocusts rise and fall.\r\n\r\n_If my vision of this man meant something, then come to me now, White\r\nBear, and tell me what I must do._\r\n\r\nHe carried a handful of bits of magic mushroom in a saddlebag, but\r\nseveral times since his spirit journey the White Bear had spoken to him\r\nwithout the help of the mushroom and without his mind leaving his body.\r\nAll he needed to do, sometimes, was sit quietly and listen. He waited\r\nnow, sometimes looking at Pierre, sometimes looking at the twigs and\r\nmoss and grass on the ground.\r\n\r\n_Perhaps no spirit can reach me here in the land of the pale eyes._\r\n\r\nHe was about to give up and get to his feet. He would beg Pierre to let\r\nhim go back to the Sauk.\r\n\r\nThen a voice spoke deep and clear in his mind, and it was not his\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n_Go and meet your grandfather._\r\n\r\nA warmth spread from the center of his body to hands and feet that a\r\nmoment ago had been icy with fear. Knowing that he had not left his\r\nspirit helper behind when he left Saukenuk gave him new confidence.\r\n\r\nHe held out his hands, palms up. \"Let us go to meet my grandfather.\"\r\n\r\nThe smile on Pierre's long face mirrored the glow Auguste felt inside\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nThey remounted and rode around to a gateway in the west side of the\r\nfence surrounding the house. Auguste, with his newfound strength,\r\nendured the curious stares of the men and women gathered at the gate to\r\ngreet Pierre.\r\n\r\n\"Look, your grandfather is waiting for you,\" said Pierre, his voice\r\nringing with joy.\r\n\r\nBefore a doorway sheltered by its own wooden roof, an old man, a very\r\nstout young woman and a plump young man awaited them.\r\n\r\nThe old man's eyes were blue like Pierre's but they seemed to glitter\r\nand to see deeply into Auguste. He was tall and thin and slightly\r\nstooped with age. His clothes were simple--a black jacket over a white\r\nshirt, and black trousers that tightened below his knees and ended in\r\nstraps that ran under shiny black shoes. He leaned on a black stick with\r\na silver head.\r\n\r\nHis heart fluttering with excitement, Auguste got down from his horse\r\nand took a tentative step forward. The old man approached him, his\r\nexpression as fierce as a hawk's. He looked hard into Auguste's face.\r\n\r\nThe old man spoke to him in a language of the pale eyes, so rapidly that\r\nAuguste could not hope to understand him.\r\n\r\nPierre said, \"Your grandfather says he sees at once that you are a\r\nmember of our family. He sees it in the shape of your eyes. He sees it\r\nin your nose, in your chin. He sees that like all de Marion men you are\r\nvery tall.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is my grandfather's name?\" Auguste asked.\r\n\r\n\"He is the Chevalier Elysée de Marion.\"\r\n\r\n\"El-izay,\" Auguste said, and his grandfather clapped his hands and\r\ngrinned.\r\n\r\n\"But you should call him Grandpapa,\" Pierre concluded.\r\n\r\n\"Grandpapa.\" That was another word Père Isaac had taught him.\r\n\r\nGrandpapa gave a cackling old man's laugh, threw his arms wide and\r\nhugged Auguste. Auguste hugged him back, rather gingerly, fearing his\r\nbones might crack. A thought came to Auguste, and he let go of his\r\ngrandfather. He hurried back to his horse and took out of the saddlebag\r\nthe tobacco pouch he had packed along with his small medicine bundle.\r\n\r\nHe went back to Elysée and held the pouch out with both hands.\r\n\r\nIn his best English he said, \"Please, I give Grandpapa tobacco.\"\r\n\r\nElysée took the pouch and opened it, sniffed and grinned appreciatively.\r\nHe and Pierre exchanged words.\r\n\r\nPierre said, \"I have told him that among the Sauk, tobacco is offered to\r\nhonored friends, to men of high rank and to great spirits. This pleases\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Auguste,\" Grandpapa said. \"I will smoke it in my pipe after\r\nwe eat together.\" This time he spoke slowly enough for Auguste to\r\nunderstand him.\r\n\r\nGrandpapa now took the stout woman by the arm and pulled her forward.\r\n\r\n\"This is your aunt, my sister, Nicole Hopkins,\" said Pierre.\r\n\r\nNever among the Sauk had he seen a woman with such broad hips and such a\r\nvast bosom. She stepped forward and placed her lips, to Auguste's\r\nsurprise, on his cheek, making a little smacking sound. Not sure what to\r\ndo, Auguste put his arms around the woman as he had around his\r\ngrandfather. She felt soft and comfortable and not at all fragile, and\r\nhe hugged her hard. He felt powerful muscles under her ample flesh. His\r\naunt returned the embrace with strong arms. She smelled of flowers.\r\n\r\nAll at once, Auguste sensed that there was a baby growing inside the\r\nwoman holding him. Not because she was so big; it had nothing to do with\r\nthe way she looked. It was a sensing, and he was pleased to know that,\r\nalong with the White Bear, he had not left his powers behind at\r\nSaukenuk.\r\n\r\nPierre said, \"Now meet Frank Hopkins, your uncle by marriage.\"\r\n\r\nAt Pierre's gesture the sandy-haired man approached Auguste. Auguste\r\nopened his arms to hug him, but the man stuck his right hand out. The\r\nman's fingers were black. That was odd; he had never seen painted\r\nfingers before. Was this another pale eyes custom? Auguste decided he\r\nwas expected to hold out his own right hand. Frank seized his hand in a\r\nstrong grip and shook it up and down.\r\n\r\n\"Frank makes the talking papers from which people may read and learn\r\nthings,\" said Pierre. \"He also builds things of wood. He built some of\r\nthe newer buildings here on our land. Frank and Nicole and their\r\nchildren live over by the river in a town called Victor. He built many\r\nof the houses there, too.\"\r\n\r\nThe people had been so friendly that Auguste had gotten over much of his\r\nfear, but when he saw Pierre wave him toward the door, which yawned\r\nabove him like an enormous cave mouth, he felt cold once again.\r\n\r\nBut he followed Pierre through the door, and his breath left his body in\r\namazement.\r\n\r\nIt was like being in a forest clearing where the trees towered over you\r\nand their branches met high up, blocking out the sky. In a Sauk lodge he\r\ncould reach up and touch the roof without straightening his arm. Here\r\nthe ceiling was hidden in shadows, and huge square-cut timbers crossed\r\nthe open space above his head.\r\n\r\nHung by ropes from those timbers were big circles of wood that Père\r\nIsaac had said were called wheels. These wheels were turned on their\r\nsides, and set on them were dozens of the little white sticks of wax\r\nthat pale eyes used to make light. A few of the more prosperous Sauk\r\nfamilies sometimes used such wax sticks to light their lodges.\r\n\r\nAuguste looked around in wonder. The huge room was full of objects whose\r\npurpose he could not guess. Doorways led to other parts of this house or\r\nto attached houses. Cooking smells of many kinds of good food filled the\r\nair.\r\n\r\nPale eyes men and women stood about in the hall and watched Auguste and\r\nhis father and grandfather enter.\r\n\r\nTwo small boys and a girl running through the hall stopped to stare at\r\nhim. Frank Hopkins called to them and they approached slowly.\r\n\r\n\"These are Thomas, Benjamin and Abigail, Nicole and Frank's children,\"\r\nsaid Pierre.\r\n\r\n_Their other children_, thought Auguste, wondering whether Nicole\r\nherself knew what he knew about her.\r\n\r\nAbigail stood close to her father, her mouth and eyes wide open.\r\n\r\nThomas, the biggest of the three, said, \"Gosh almighty, I got a real\r\nInjun for a cousin!\"\r\n\r\nBenjamin walked slowly over to Auguste, suddenly reached out and gripped\r\nthe deerhorn handle of the knife at his belt. Auguste tensed.\r\n\r\nBut Benjamin grinned up at Auguste and let go of the knife without\r\ntrying to pull it out of its scabbard. Then he ran back to his father.\r\n\r\nGrandpapa Elysée beckoned, and as Auguste walked toward him he noticed\r\nthat the soles of his moccasins were striking a hard surface. He looked\r\ndown to see that the floor of the lodge was covered with flat stones.\r\nAuguste and the others followed Grandpapa across the length of the floor\r\nto a stone hearth so big a man could stand inside it.\r\n\r\nThey passed three long, cloth-covered platforms raised as high above the\r\nfloor as the sleeping platforms in Sauk and Fox summer lodges.\r\n\r\n\"Those are tables,\" Pierre said. Auguste remembered the word from a book\r\nof words and pictures Père Isaac had shown him. On the tables lay a\r\nconfusion of shiny objects.\r\n\r\nA man standing by the hearth, who appeared as old as Elysée, stepped\r\nforward and bowed. He had a round, bright red nose and white whiskers\r\nthat stood out on either side of his face.\r\n\r\n\"This is Guichard, our majordomo,\" said Pierre.\r\n\r\n\"Ma-ja domo,\" repeated Auguste.\r\n\r\n\"Guichard came over from France with us thirty years ago.\"\r\n\r\nGuichard said, \"I greet you, Auguste.\" Auguste was amazed to hear him\r\nspeak in the Sauk language. He spoke with a lisp, though, and Auguste\r\nnoticed when he opened his mouth that he had no front teeth.\r\n\r\nPierre clapped Guichard on the shoulder. \"I do not know how he does\r\nthese things, but he always surprises us with what he has learned. And\r\nby his care for us in so many ways.\"\r\n\r\nGuichard stepped back with another bow, and Pierre turned to a short man\r\nand a plump woman also standing before the hearth. The woman's full lips\r\ncurved in a smile of greeting for Pierre; then she plucked at her\r\nskirts, lifting them a bit, and bent her knees and ducked her head.\r\n\r\n\"This is Marchette Perrault,\" Pierre said, and Auguste noticed that his\r\nnormally pale face was flushed. \"She reigns over our kitchen.\" Auguste\r\ndid not need to rely on his special sense to see that there was a loving\r\nsecret between Marchette and his father.\r\n\r\nThe man standing beside Marchette, short and powerful-looking, with a\r\nbristling brown beard, was staring at Pierre with hatred in his face,\r\nhis eyes narrowed. His mouth was invisible in his beard, but Auguste\r\nknew that his lips were pressed together, his teeth clenched. He also\r\nknew that this short man was as strong as a bull buffalo.\r\n\r\nThe look the brown-bearded man gave Pierre frightened Auguste, and he\r\nwondered if he was the only one who could see it.\r\n\r\n\"Armand Perrault, here, is the overseer of our estate,\" Pierre said,\r\napparently oblivious of the man's expression. \"He makes the crops\r\nflourish, the trees bear fruit and the cattle grow fat. He and Marchette\r\ncome from French families who settled here many generations ago.\"\r\n\r\nArmand bowed, a quick jerk of his head and shoulders, to Pierre.\r\nSomewhat to Auguste's relief, the angry man did not even look at him.\r\nAbruptly he turned his back and strode across the hall to a side door.\r\n\r\nPierre said, \"Most of those who live and work here at Victoire are\r\nIllinois people of French descent. The town, Victor, grew up after we\r\nbuilt our home here. Most of the people there are Americans from\r\nMissouri, Kentucky or back East. Everyone you meet in America is from\r\nsomewhere else.\"\r\n\r\n_Not my people_, Auguste thought.\r\n\r\nMarchette made another bow to Pierre and left, too, to go into another\r\nconnected house in which Auguste saw a fire burning under a huge metal\r\npot in another hearth. There was much smoke and steam in that lodge, and\r\nhe could not see everything, but the good smells were coming from there,\r\nand he remembered that he had eaten nothing today but a little dried\r\nvenison.\r\n\r\nPierre took Auguste by the arm and led him to a place at the table near\r\nGrandpapa. Guichard pushed a wooden seat made of sticks toward him. A\r\n\"chair,\" Auguste remembered, from Père Isaac's picture book.\r\n\r\n_Why do they sit up high and raise their food up so high?_ Auguste\r\nwondered. Perhaps pale eyes did not keep their floors clean enough to\r\nsit on and eat from. But these appeared very clean.\r\n\r\n\"This is a special meal in your honor,\" said Pierre. \"Most of the people\r\nwho work on our land will be eating here with us.\" Men and women were\r\nseating themselves at the other tables.\r\n\r\n_A feast!_ thought Auguste. Perhaps there would be dancing afterward.\r\n\r\n\"How many people live on your land, Father?\" he asked in Sauk.\r\n\r\n\"About a hundred men, women and children live and work here,\" Pierre\r\nanswered. \"Beyond the hills to the west, by the river, is the settlement\r\ncalled Victor, where another hundred people live. Many of them work for\r\nus too. Nicole and Frank live in Victor.\"\r\n\r\nTwo hundred, thought Auguste. That was not so many, after all. There\r\nwere nearly two thousand people in the British Band.\r\n\r\nNicole sat beside him, Pierre across the table from him. Nicole went\r\nthrough the names of the objects on the table--\"plate,\" \"glass,\"\r\n\"knife,\" \"fork,\" \"spoon.\" Guichard was going around the table behind the\r\npeople sitting there, filling each glass with a red liquid from a\r\npitcher.\r\n\r\nAuguste had seen beads and other small objects made of glass at\r\nSaukenuk, but here glass was everywhere. What was glass, and how did the\r\npale eyes make things from it?\r\n\r\nEven as he was wondering about glass he saw his father take out of his\r\ncoat pocket an oval silver case hanging from a purple cord around his\r\nneck. Pierre opened the case and took out yet two more small, round\r\npieces of glass in a metal frame. To Auguste's bewilderment, he put\r\nthese over his eyes, like a transparent mask. He smiled when he saw\r\nAuguste staring.\r\n\r\n\"Spectacles. I have trouble seeing things that are near to me, and these\r\nhelp. I like to see what I'm eating.\"\r\n\r\nLast night, as Auguste lay beside the sleeping Star Arrow in the tall\r\nprairie grass, he had thought of quietly climbing on his pony and\r\nfleeing back to Saukenuk, in spite of the tobacco-sealed promise. Now\r\nhe was glad he had not run away. The people all looked kindly at him,\r\nexcept for that man Armand, and there were so many wonders to see. He\r\ncould feel his heart beating hard and his hands trembling with\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\nWhen Guichard filled his glass with the red liquid, Auguste drank from\r\nit. The liquid was cool and burned at the same time. It was bitter and\r\npuckered his lips, but was sweet in his throat. He was thirsty, so he\r\ndrank more of it.\r\n\r\n\"Wine,\" said Pierre. \"You've had it before?\"\r\n\r\n_This must be like that burning water the pale eyes call whiskey that I\r\ntasted at the council last Moon of Falling Leaves on the other side of\r\nthe Great River._ The chiefs and braves and warriors had drunk much of\r\nthe burning water from a barrel, he remembered, and they had grown\r\nmerrier and merrier. The women and boys were each allowed one small sip\r\nand the young girls none at all.\r\n\r\n\"I have tasted it,\" he said. Pierre frowned and seemed about to speak,\r\nbut he said nothing when Auguste held his empty glass out for more wine\r\nto Guichard, who was going around again with the pitcher.\r\n\r\nMen and women brought food to the table on big plates and in bowls.\r\nThere was turkey, duck, fresh venison, flat bread and round bread, dark\r\nbread, white bread and yellow corn bread, cooked fruit and raw fruit,\r\nloaves of maple sugar, fruit baked inside crusts, heaps of mashed-up\r\nvegetables. There were slices of fish burned almost black and piles of\r\nboiled crawfish. The food, Auguste saw, was coming from the connected\r\nlodge Marchette had gone into, where the big pot was with all the smoke\r\nand steam.\r\n\r\nAuguste watched the way the people at the table with him were eating. He\r\ntried to use his knife and fork as they did and saw Pierre smile\r\napprovingly. The sight and smell of the food made water fill his mouth\r\nand his stomach growl. But when he put a slice of meat in his mouth it\r\nwas unexpectedly very hot to the taste. Not just hot from being cooked,\r\nbut hot because of something cooked into it.\r\n\r\n_Peppers_, he thought. His mother kept some, traded up from the south,\r\nin her collection of medicine plants, and he had tasted their fire.\r\n\r\nPierre himself, Auguste noticed, put very small portions of food on his\r\nplate and ate little of what was there. Auguste was saddened. If only\r\nthere was something he could do for his father. He had consulted Owl\r\nCarver before leaving Saukenuk, but the old shaman had only said\r\ngloomily that in his experience such an evil spirit in the belly was\r\nusually fatal.\r\n\r\nThe hot food made Auguste thirsty, and he drank more wine. Each time he\r\nheld his glass out, Guichard, smiling toothlessly, seemed to be there\r\nwith the pitcher.\r\n\r\nStill hungry, he grew impatient with knife and fork and began picking\r\nthe food up with his hands. He tried to take small pieces with his\r\nfingers and eat quickly so that people would not notice, but then he\r\ncaught the two boys and the girl, at the other end of the table,\r\nwatching him and giggling and whispering to each other. His face went\r\nhot.\r\n\r\nNicole, sitting on his right, asked him short, simple questions about\r\nhow the Sauk and Fox lived, and he answered with the little English he\r\nhad. She smiled and nodded at him many times as he told her the Sauk\r\nnames for things, and she repeated them after him. She seemed to find\r\npronouncing them easy.\r\n\r\nThe other people mostly talked among themselves in their own language.\r\nThe pale eyes never stopped talking, it seemed. Would there never be a\r\nmoment of thoughtful silence? The voices, all speaking so fast, gabbling\r\nlike a flock of turkeys, made him dizzy.\r\n\r\nA strange feeling was coming over him. He heard a buzzing in his ears,\r\nlike locusts on the prairie. His face felt numb. He reached up and\r\ntouched his cheeks with his fingertips, and it was as if he felt his\r\nface through a thin, invisible cloth.\r\n\r\nHis stomach started to churn. He felt with a sudden panic that he could\r\nnot hold all the food he had eaten. The peppers and the wine were\r\nburning together in his stomach. He lurched to his feet, swaying from\r\nside to side. The vast room seemed to be spinning like a canoe in a\r\nwhirlpool, and the voices around him faded away.\r\n\r\nHe felt Nicole quickly stand up with him, her hand firmly on his arm,\r\nsteadying him.\r\n\r\nHe shut his eyes and held his hand tightly over his mouth, wanting to\r\ndie of shame and embarrassment. His belly bucked like a wild pony. Hot\r\nliquid spurted through his fingers.\r\n\r\n\"Here, son, here,\" a voice said. He opened his eyes to look into the\r\nface of his father, full of pain for him. Pierre held a large wooden\r\nbucket under his chin. On the other side of him Nicole had a strong grip\r\non his shoulder.\r\n\r\nAuguste took his hand away from his mouth and let his belly give up what\r\nit had held. Stained red by the wine, the food he had just eaten poured\r\ninto the bucket. The smell of vomit filled his nostrils, making him feel\r\neven sicker.\r\n\r\nHe fell to his knees, coughing, choking, tears streaming from his eyes.\r\nPierre knelt beside him, still holding the bucket for him. Auguste's\r\nstomach heaved again and again, forcing the remnants of his meal through\r\nhis throat and past his slack lips.\r\n\r\nAs he recovered a bit, he heard someone laugh softly in a distant part\r\nof the room, and someone else speak in the pale eyes' language. The tone\r\nof contempt was unmistakable.\r\n\r\nHe was overwhelmed with shame. He had made a fool of himself before his\r\nentire de Marion family and their whole tribe. He had disgraced the\r\nSauk. He had embarrassed his father.\r\n\r\nIt was as he had feared. He could not stay here. It was too painful.\r\n\r\n_Tonight_, he promised himself, holding his aching belly. _Tonight I\r\nleave the land of the pale eyes forever._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nReproaching himself, Pierre knelt beside Auguste, trying through the\r\npressure of his hand on the boy's back to tell Auguste that he loved\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n_He said he had tasted wine, but I should have known he could not drink\r\nso much. The poor boy must be dying of shame, and it is all the fault of\r\nstupid Pierre._\r\n\r\nAuguste coughed and wiped the back of his hand over his face. Pierre\r\npatted him gently on the back.\r\n\r\nNicole, kneeling on Auguste's other side, suddenly turned her head\r\ntoward the door and drew in a frightened breath. Pierre looked up to see\r\nwhat it was.\r\n\r\nA figure filled the doorway, silhouetted in the yellow rectangle of\r\nafternoon sunlight.\r\n\r\nPierre at once recognized the truculent set of Raoul's broad shoulders,\r\nthe forward thrust of his head under the wide-brimmed hat.\r\n\r\nPierre had time for one more anguished thought of self-reproach as his\r\nyounger brother strode toward them.\r\n\r\n_For this, too, I should have better prepared Auguste._\r\n\r\nRaoul's boots sounded on the flagstone floor.\r\n\r\nPierre tugged on Auguste's arm, helping him to his feet. He heard Nicole\r\nwhisk away the bucket.\r\n\r\n\"So, this is the little mongrel?\" Raoul's deep voice boomed in the\r\ncavernous log hall.\r\n\r\n\"Raoul,\" Pierre said, \"this is your nephew, Auguste.\"\r\n\r\nPierre turned to Auguste and in Sauk said, \"This is your uncle, Raoul.\r\nHe lives here with me and your grandfather. He speaks with a rough\r\ntongue, but do not fear him.\"\r\n\r\nHow could the boy not fear a man like Raoul?\r\n\r\n\"Auguste, is it? A fine French name for a redskin.\" Raoul set his fists\r\non his hips, throwing back his blue jacket to show his gilt-handled\r\npistol and a huge knife in its scabbard. At the sight of the weapons\r\nPierre's heart pounded.\r\n\r\nRaoul went up to Auguste and stared into his face as Pierre stood\r\ntensely.\r\n\r\nRaoul said, \"Well, brother, you actually did it. You made yourself a\r\nson.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad you admit that,\" said Pierre.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I admit that. He's got de Marion written all over his dirty face.\r\nBut don't call him my 'nephew.' I reserve that title for legitimate\r\nkin.\"\r\n\r\nPierre hoped Auguste's knowledge of English was not enough to let him\r\nunderstand how he was being insulted. The boy looked from Pierre to\r\nRaoul as they spoke, his large, dark eyes watchful, his face\r\nexpressionless.\r\n\r\n\"Raoul, stop this.\" It was Nicole, back from getting rid of the bucket.\r\n\"I'm Auguste's aunt and you're his uncle, and you might as well get used\r\nto it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you are spoiling our dinner, Raoul,\" Elysée said. \"Either sit and\r\neat with us like a civilized man or leave us alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Spoiling your dinner?\" Raoul gave a bellow of laughter. \"Mean to tell\r\nme it doesn't spoil your dinner to see that savage puking in our great\r\nhall? Mean to tell me _he's_ civilized?\"\r\n\r\nPierre glanced across the table at his father and Frank Hopkins, who had\r\nboth risen to their feet. Elysée's eyes burned with anger. Frank held\r\nhis little girl's hand and looked sombrely at Raoul. The two Hopkins\r\nboys stared at their uncle.\r\n\r\n_I pray God they don't admire him. Boys have a way of looking up to men\r\nwho behave like brutes._\r\n\r\nRaoul turned to Nicole, his teeth flashing white under his thick black\r\nmustache. \"You really want an Indian nephew? Have you forgot what\r\nIndians did to your sister?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I'll never forget what happened to Helene,\" Nicole said. \"None of\r\nus will. But Auguste had nothing to do with that.\"\r\n\r\n\"You didn't watch your sister die,\" Raoul said. \"So that just the sight\r\nof an Indian makes you want to kill.\"\r\n\r\nPierre saw that Raoul was working himself up into a rage. He would talk\r\nand talk, and every word he said would make him angrier, until at last,\r\nthe explosion. A spasm of pain shot across Pierre's stomach.\r\n\r\n_Not now_, he prayed. _God, let the illness leave me alone until I can\r\nbe alone with it._\r\n\r\nNicole's cheeks were an even brighter red than was usual for her, but\r\nshe spoke gently. \"Raoul, you do have a living sister. If it had been me\r\nat Fort Dearborn instead of Helene--if I had been raped and murdered--I\r\nwould be looking down from Heaven, and I would be hoping your wound\r\nwould heal. I would pray that you would welcome Pierre's son, your\r\nnephew, into your home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop saying that this filthy savage is my nephew,\" said Raoul. \"Look at\r\nhim standing there, staring at me. You know what the word mongrel means,\r\nredskin?\"\r\n\r\nPierre felt a surge of pride as he saw Auguste standing straight and\r\nslender, gazing levelly at Raoul. Savage? Even though he had been sick\r\nonly a moment ago, Auguste held himself as regally as a young prince.\r\n\r\n\"As for you, Nicole,\" Raoul went on, \"don't ever think you can speak for\r\nHelene. She may be in Heaven now, but she got there by way of Hell. No\r\ndecent woman could imagine what she suffered.\"\r\n\r\nPierre almost screamed aloud as the pain in his belly stabbed him again.\r\nHe clutched at his stomach. Just when he needed all his strength!\r\n\r\nAuguste looked into his eyes, then down at his hand.\r\n\r\n\"You hurt, Father,\" Auguste said in English. \"Must sit down.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh? He's already got a few words of English?\" said Raoul. \"You're\r\ntraining him to talk, eh? Like a parrot? Going to put him in a medicine\r\nshow?\"\r\n\r\nElysée suddenly spoke in a loud voice, \"My friends--those who were\r\ninvited to dine with us here today--will you please excuse us and give\r\nus privacy? We have family matters to discuss.\"\r\n\r\nSilently, eyes cast down, the thirty or so servants and field workers\r\nwho had been invited to celebrate the coming of Pierre's son filed out\r\nof the hall.\r\n\r\nPierre thought, _In so many things I have failed today_.\r\n\r\n\"Raoul,\" Elysée said, \"I have not forgiven Helene's killers. But I am\r\nnot stupid enough to hate all Indians, and neither should you be. Do you\r\nthink whites have never tortured and killed Indian women?\"\r\n\r\nRaoul bared his teeth again. \"If you can't hate the Indians for what\r\nthey did to your daughter and to me, then you never loved either one of\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\nPierre felt a sudden surge of anger. \"Raoul, I forbid you to speak that\r\nway to our father. You are cruel and unjust.\"\r\n\r\n\"You owe _me_ justice, Pierre, you and Papa. Where was he when you\r\nabandoned me to the Indians? Where were you?\"\r\n\r\nPierre's legs shook. He could feel the rage radiating from Raoul; it was\r\nlike standing too close to a red-hot stove.\r\n\r\nAuguste said, \"Father.\"\r\n\r\nPierre turned and looked into the dark young eyes.\r\n\r\nAuguste spoke in Sauk. \"Father, I am the cause of this man's anger.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is much to explain, son,\" said Pierre. \"Be patient and quiet, and\r\nall will be well.\"\r\n\r\nPierre saw fear struggling with resolution in his son's face. A pallor\r\nin the fine olive skin showed that Auguste had not yet gotten over being\r\nsick. Auguste squared his shoulders and took a step toward Raoul. He\r\nraised his right hand in greeting.\r\n\r\n\"I greet uncle,\" he said solemnly in English.\r\n\r\n\"Keep this mongrel away from me, Pierre,\" Raoul said.\r\n\r\n\"Frank,\" said Nicole, \"take the children out of here.\"\r\n\r\nFrank picked Abigail up and carried her, with Tom and Benjamin trailing.\r\nHe walked off toward the kitchen, looking back over his shoulder at\r\nNicole.\r\n\r\nElysée said, \"Remember, Raoul, this is my grandson.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your grandson!\" Raoul spat.\r\n\r\nAuguste held out his right hand to Raoul. \"I sorry you angry. Want be\r\nfriend.\"\r\n\r\nIn a moment, Pierre thought, he would have to get between them. But his\r\nstomach hurt so badly that he could hardly move.\r\n\r\n\"If you want to be my friend, you mongrel bastard, get as far away from\r\nthis house and from me as you can,\" Raoul said.\r\n\r\nAuguste took another step toward Raoul, still holding out his hand. He'd\r\nlearned about shaking hands from Frank Hopkins just a little while ago,\r\nPierre remembered.\r\n\r\n\"Auguste, no!\" Pierre cried.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you try to touch me, redskin.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul thrust out his own hand and struck at Auguste's. He grabbed\r\nAuguste's shirt, twisting the buckskin in his big hand.\r\n\r\nRaoul had lost all control. The fury was upon him. Pierre forgot about\r\nhis own pain and tried to throw himself between Raoul and Auguste. His\r\nchest hit Raoul's arm, hard as an iron bar.\r\n\r\n\"Let go of him, Raoul,\" Pierre said.\r\n\r\n\"Raoul, stop it!\" Elysée shouted.\r\n\r\n\"All right.\" Raoul punched his fist into Auguste's chest and released\r\nhim, sending the boy staggering backward to fall to the floor.\r\n\r\nRage blazed up inside Pierre. The sight of his son knocked to the floor\r\nswept away all constraint. To the Devil with trying to reason with\r\nRaoul. He rushed at Raoul and swung his arm with all his strength,\r\nbringing his palm against Raoul's mouth.\r\n\r\nThough open-handed, it was a blow that would have knocked many a man\r\ndown. Raoul only staggered back half a step.\r\n\r\nBut a trickle of blood appeared at the corner of his mouth.\r\n\r\n\"You still fight like a Frenchman, Pierre,\" said Raoul with a grin,\r\nwiping his mouth. \"Slapping a man. Think you're still a count or\r\nsomething? Fight like an American.\"\r\n\r\nHe lunged at Pierre. Pierre barely saw, out of the corner of his eye,\r\nthe fist coming at him. A cannon went off at the side of his head.\r\n\r\nHe was on the floor, flat on his back.\r\n\r\nNicole screamed, \"No! No, Auguste!\"\r\n\r\nPierre rolled his aching head to one side to see Auguste standing over\r\nhim, his hand on the deerhorn hilt of the knife that hung at his belt,\r\nthe knife Pierre had left for him when he was a baby. Nicole held his\r\narm with both hands.\r\n\r\n\"Want to fight with knives?\" Raoul said. He slid his own huge hunting\r\nknife out and held it upright, the point glittering in the candlelight.\r\n\r\n\"Come on, redskin!\" Raoul shouted, but even as he spoke he charged at\r\nAuguste, as Auguste struggled to break free from Nicole. Raoul's knife\r\nflashed and Pierre heard a cry of pain, and Nicole was between Auguste\r\nand Raoul, and Auguste had his hand to his face and blood was running\r\nthrough his fingers.\r\n\r\nRaoul stepped away from Auguste and wiped his knife on a white\r\ntablecloth.\r\n\r\n\"What have you done?\" Pierre shouted.\r\n\r\n\"I was kind,\" Raoul said with a white-toothed grin.\r\n\r\nPierre rushed to Auguste. Blood flowed from a long cut that ran straight\r\ndown Auguste's cheek from just below his eye to the corner of his mouth.\r\nThe front of Auguste's tan buckskin shirt was stained red.\r\n\r\n\"If he'd pulled that knife, I would have taken his eye,\" Raoul said\r\nsoftly. \"I just left a mark on him. So he won't forget me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let go of me, Father,\" Auguste said in Sauk, in a level, terrible\r\nvoice. \"I have to kill him.\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" said Pierre, holding Auguste tighter.\r\n\r\n_You're a brave boy, but I'm afraid it's you that would be killed, my\r\nson._\r\n\r\nBlood pounded in Pierre's head. He wanted to take Auguste's knife--the\r\nknife he'd given Auguste long ago--and drive it into Raoul's chest.\r\n\r\n_If I were like Raoul, I would do just that. Or try to._\r\n\r\n\"Raoul, for this I will never forgive you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Forgive me?\" Raoul shouted. \"Can I forgive you for bringing this savage\r\nhere to cheat me?\"\r\n\r\nNicole took Auguste from Pierre's arms. She pressed a white napkin to\r\nhis bleeding face and took him to a chair to sit down. As he sat,\r\nAuguste turned to shoot Raoul a look of pure hate.\r\n\r\n\"Cheat you? What are you talking about?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just remember, when you die--and I hope God makes it soon--I _will_\r\nhave this estate.\"\r\n\r\nPierre felt Raoul's words as if that blade had plunged into his heart.\r\nThat his own brother should wish him dead ...\r\n\r\nPierre went to stand by Auguste, seated in a chair with Nicole wiping\r\nhis slashed face.\r\n\r\nPierre said, \"In the will I wrote years ago I named you as my heir. I\r\nnever thought to change that will. Until today.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul, still wiping his knife, snorted. \"No court in Illinois would let\r\na man disinherit a legitimate white brother in favor of a half-Indian\r\nbastard.\"\r\n\r\nPierre let his hand rest on Auguste's shoulder. The boy's eyes burned up\r\nat him. Pierre looked down at the blood-soaked napkin that Nicole\r\npressed to Auguste's cheek.\r\n\r\nAuguste, speaking in the Sauk tongue, broke the silence that had\r\nfollowed Raoul's words. \"Even if he is your brother and my uncle, this\r\nman is our enemy, Father. I will stand side by side with you against\r\nhim.\" Auguste put his hand over the hand that lay on his shoulder.\r\n\r\nRaoul slammed his knife into its sheath. \"You've driven me out of my\r\nhome, Pierre. I'm not living under the same roof with an Indian. I won't\r\nbe back till I can come back as master of this house.\"\r\n\r\nHe strode to the door and turned again. \"And then I'll bring my own\r\nfamily with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean--your own family?\" Elysée called across the long hall.\r\n\r\n\"I'm marrying Eli Greenglove's daughter,\" Raoul said with a grin. \"And\r\nthat mongrel had better not try to touch my children's birth-right.\"\r\n\r\nHe was gone, leaving the door hanging open behind him, sunlight pouring\r\nin.\r\n\r\nPierre looked miserably down at Auguste and thought, _I hope your\r\nshaman's skills make you better at predicting the future than I have\r\nbeen, my son_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK 2\r\n\r\n1831\r\n\r\n\r\nMoon of Ripe Cherries\r\n\r\n_July_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8\r\n\r\nHomecoming\r\n\r\n\r\nRejoicing at the sight of Victor, Auguste stepped up to the gangplank of\r\nthe paddle wheeler _Virginia_ and paused there a moment to look around.\r\nHe couldn't help himself: he smiled broadly. The settlement hugging the\r\nbluff was not home, but it was closer to home than he had been in a long\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nAnd this summer, he had decided, he would go back to his true home. He\r\nwould end the sorrow of being cut off from his people.\r\n\r\nThis was the sixth spring since Pierre de Marion had come and taken him\r\nto Victoire, and, as with every spring before it, he missed Saukenuk\r\nterribly. He longed for his mother, for the teachings of Owl Carver, for\r\nthe arms of Redbird, whom he had lost almost as soon as he made her his.\r\n\r\nFor six years--he had learned to count years as white people did--he had\r\nobeyed his father and the promise made with the calumet and had not\r\ntried even to send a message to the British Band. He even felt it was a\r\nwise rule. To communicate with his loved ones would have torn him in\r\ntwo. But more than a month ago in New York City, strolling in the warm\r\nevening air on the busy cobblestone streets, past dooryards where lilacs\r\nwere blooming, he made up his mind that when he returned to Illinois he\r\nwould visit Victoire only briefly and then would go back to Saukenuk. He\r\nwas twenty-one years old now, and among white people that meant he was\r\nmaster of his own life.\r\n\r\nHe gazed up at the bluff. There were more houses up there than when he\r\nhad last come out here, two years ago. Some were built on the bottomland\r\nitself, in spite of the danger of flooding.\r\n\r\nHe saw the palisade and flags and towers of Raoul de Marion's trading\r\npost at the top of the bluff, and felt his joy fading. He would have to\r\nface Raoul's insults and threats, as he had every other time he came\r\nback to Victor. His belly tightened as he remembered, as if it had just\r\nhappened, that first encounter six years ago, the burning-ice feel of\r\nthe knifepoint slicing into his cheek, his hand gripping his own knife,\r\nAunt Nicole and Father holding him back.\r\n\r\nSeemingly with a will of its own his hand went to the scar and his\r\nfinger traced the ridge that ran from eye to mouth.\r\n\r\nHe brought his gaze down from the top of the bluff and saw a more\r\nwelcome sight--Grandpapa, Aunt Nicole and Guichard in a black open\r\ncarriage from the estate, waiting to take him up to Victoire. He ran\r\ndown the gangplank and strode over to them.\r\n\r\n\"Auguste! My God, you're beautiful!\" Aunt Nicole exclaimed, and then her\r\nface reddened and she looked downward.\r\n\r\nHe felt that he looked good, though \"beautiful,\" as he understood\r\nEnglish, was not the right word for a woman to use about a man. But he\r\nsupposed she admired his new clothes, the fawn-colored cutaway coat and\r\nvest, the ruffled silk shirt, the tight, bottle-green trousers. He\r\nwished he were not already holding his tall beaver hat in his hand, so\r\nthat he could tip it to her with the graceful motion he'd learned\r\nwatching the dandies on Broad Way.\r\n\r\nGrandpapa leaned out of the carriage and hugged Auguste. His embrace\r\nfelt strong, and his eyes were bright. Auguste was happy to see him in\r\ngood health.\r\n\r\n_But where is Father?_\r\n\r\nAuguste shook hands with Guichard, who had climbed down stiffly from the\r\ndriver's seat.\r\n\r\n\"Your trunk, Monsieur Auguste?\"\r\n\r\nAuguste pointed out the big wooden chest with brass fittings that had\r\nbeen unloaded at the Victor pier along with bales and barrels from the\r\nhold of the _Virginia_.\r\n\r\nGuichard approached two buckskin-clad men lounging by a piling. He\r\npointed out the trunk as Auguste had done.\r\n\r\n\"For _him_?\" said one of the men, glowering at Auguste from under his\r\ncoonskin cap. \"White men don't wait on goddamn Injuns.\" He spat tobacco\r\njuice at Guichard's feet and turned away, as did the other man.\r\n\r\nAuguste wanted to throw the man who had spat at Guichard into the\r\nriver. He had no doubt that he could do it, though like most men who\r\nlived in Victor, the man was armed with knife and pistol. Auguste had\r\nbeen taught to fight as a Sauk, and he had been a champion boxer,\r\nwrestler and fencer at St. George's School. But he was not going to get\r\ninto a brawl in his first minutes ashore. Time enough for that if he met\r\nRaoul.\r\n\r\n\"Come on, Guichard. The trunk's light enough. We don't need any help.\"\r\nThe old servant taking one end and Auguste the other, they loaded it\r\ninto the back of the carriage.\r\n\r\n\"Good to see you again, Grandpapa,\" Auguste said as he dropped into the\r\nseat facing Elysée and Nicole, his back to the driver. \"Aunt Nicole,\r\nit's you who are beautiful. But where's Father?\"\r\n\r\nGrandpapa patted him on the knee. \"Not feeling well, I'm afraid. He\r\nsends his apologies. We will go to him now, at once.\"\r\n\r\nGrandpapa was trying to make his voice sound unconcerned. But Auguste\r\nheard an undertone of sorrow, the anguish of a father who had lost one\r\nof his children years ago and would soon lose another.\r\n\r\nWith understanding, grief sank into Auguste's marrow. Father--Star\r\nArrow--had hung on these past six years, growing sicker and sicker, the\r\nevil in his belly swelling up like a poisonous toad. Now the end was\r\nnear.\r\n\r\nAuguste found himself looking deep into Aunt Nicole's eyes, full of\r\nshared sorrow.\r\n\r\nGuichard flicked the reins, and the carriage started off, turning away\r\nfrom the dock, passing the warehouses and rattling down the long\r\ndusty-white road that led across the bottomland fields to the bluff. It\r\nmust have been a good spring out here; though this was only the\r\nbeginning of July, the corn was already up to a man's waist.\r\n\r\nAuguste felt he would look better wearing his beaver hat as they rode\r\nalong. He put it on his head, pulling the rolled-up brim down with both\r\nhands, and set it in place with a pat on the crown.\r\n\r\n\"So, you are now a finished graduate of St. George's School?\" said\r\nElysée with a smile. \"Monsieur Charles Winans has sent long letters full\r\nof good reports about you.\"\r\n\r\nAunt Nicole reached over and squeezed his hand. \"We're proud of you,\r\nAuguste.\" Her soft, fleshy hand was warm, and her eyes sparkled at him.\r\nHe sensed a feeling in her that was more than the affection of an aunt\r\nfor a nephew. She now had eight children, he knew, and every time he\r\nhad seen her and Frank together, they had seemed very much in love. But\r\nAunt Nicole was a big woman. She had room in her big heart, perhaps, for\r\nmore than one love.\r\n\r\nEmbarrassed by what he felt radiating from her, Auguste turned to\r\nElysée.\r\n\r\n\"If I learned anything at St. George's, I owe it all to the way you\r\nprepared me, Grandpapa. Anyone who could take a boy who could barely\r\nspeak English, and in two years cram enough knowledge into his head for\r\nhim to go to secondary school in New York City--such a man is no\r\nordinary teacher.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were no ordinary pupil, my boy,\" said Elysée, leaning back in the\r\ncarriage, his hands resting one on top of the other on his silver-headed\r\ncane. \"And Père Isaac laid down a solid foundation in that head of\r\nyours. Those Jesuits are good for that, at least, black-hearted rogues\r\nthough they may be in most other respects.\"\r\n\r\n\"Papa!\" Nicole gave Elysée a reproving frown.\r\n\r\nElysée quickly patted her knee. \"Forgive me, my child. Let me not shake\r\nthe faith that sustains you.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would take more than your wicked tongue to disturb my faith, Papa,\"\r\nNicole said with a wry smile.\r\n\r\nIt was amusing to hear Grandpapa and Aunt Nicole bicker about what the\r\nwhites called \"faith.\" As the carriage rolled along, Auguste recalled\r\nthe many lectures he had listened to on Jesus and the Trinity at St.\r\nGeorge's, which was affiliated with the Episcopal Church. But Auguste\r\nhad walked with the White Bear and talked with the Turtle. He _knew_\r\nthem as he had never known the white people's God, and what went on in\r\ntheir dimly lit, waxy-smelling churches had no attraction for him.\r\n\r\nHe knew that Christians, for the most part, saw his beliefs about the\r\nspirit world as rubbish sprung out of ignorance--or, worse, inspired by\r\nthe Evil One. Père Isaac's efforts to persuade him to walk in the way of\r\nJesus had prepared him for that. At school he did not speak of things\r\nsacred to him, so as not to expose them to white scorn. When teachers\r\nand fellow students tried to persuade him to take instruction in\r\nChristianity, he was polite and evasive.\r\n\r\nAnd when he felt he was smothering in the noise and crowding and dirt of\r\nthe huge city of New York, he would borrow a pony from the lady he\r\ncalled Aunt Emilie--his father's cousin, actually--and ride out of New\r\nYork along a trail that led to the north end of the island of\r\nManhattan. There in a forest cave he had found, he would chew a bit of\r\nthe sacred mushroom Owl Carver had given him and restore his link with\r\nthe spirit world by journeying with the White Bear. All through these\r\nsix years, _his_ faith had remained strong.\r\n\r\nNicole broke in on his thoughts. \"You're still studying medicine?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just a beginning: I've read some books, attended some lectures. I\r\nassisted a surgeon--Dr. Martin Bernard--at New York Hospital. I bought\r\nmyself a surgeon's box of instruments--got it in the trunk, there. But\r\nif anybody came down with anything worse than an ingrown toenail, I'd be\r\nscared to do anything about it.\"\r\n\r\nElysée said, \"You can pull teeth, I hope, like any proper surgeon?\"\r\n\r\nAuguste shrugged. \"I do have a turnkey for that. But I've never actually\r\nused it.\"\r\n\r\n\"The only person in town who knows anything about treating the sick is\r\nGram Medill, the midwife,\" Nicole said. \"Tom Slattery, the blacksmith,\r\npulls teeth. We need a real doctor.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste felt a fluttering in his stomach as he wondered when he should\r\ntell this white family of his that he wanted to leave them. Nicole was\r\nthinking, he realized, that he would stay here at Victoire.\r\n\r\nThe steel-reinforced wooden wheels of the carriage bumped mercilessly\r\nover the rutted road, and Auguste hoped Nicole wasn't pregnant at the\r\nmoment. The fact that his shaman's sense did not tell him reminded him\r\nthat he had been too long away from the Sauk. As they began to climb the\r\nroad that ran up the bluff, Nicole pointed out to Auguste that the newer\r\nhouses were made of boards rather than logs, because Frank had set up a\r\nsawmill and workshop on the Peach River. Frank was now a master\r\ncarpenter, with four workers to help him when there was a house to be\r\nbuilt.\r\n\r\n\"But he'd sell the mill in a minute if printing alone would provide him\r\nwith a living,\" she said. \"That's where his heart is.\"\r\n\r\nElysée said, \"Pierre and I offered Frank a regular income, so that he\r\ncould give all his time to his newspaper and to printing, but he\r\nwouldn't hear of it. He got a bit haughty when I pressed him, and\r\ninformed me that the system of feudal patronage is dead. I assured him\r\nthat I was well aware of that, and that is why I am here and not in\r\nFrance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Frank is proud, Papa,\" said Nicole.\r\n\r\nElysée nodded. \"I fear he is too often a proud papa.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste roared, and Nicole, though she blushed, could not help laughing.\r\n\r\n\"The town grows bigger every year,\" Auguste said. Nicole nodded\r\nsympathetically; she seemed to have guessed what he was thinking: How\r\nnumerous the whites were, as he had seen for himself in the East, and\r\nhow inexorably they were filling up this part of the country, like a\r\nriver in flood. Last year the New York papers had reported the results\r\nof the 1830 census; the United States was over twelve million, Auguste\r\nhad read, a number he could not even imagine. And 150,000 of those were\r\nhere in the state of Illinois, balanced against the six thousand Sauk\r\nand Fox. Black Hawk's people, the British Band, numbered only two\r\nthousand. Hopeless.\r\n\r\n\"Victor had a hundred or so people the year you came here,\" said Elysée.\r\n\"Now there are over four hundred. As you see, the bluff is completely\r\ncovered with houses. And we have many new industries and crafts. A\r\npreacher, a Reverend Hale, has put up a church on the prairie to the\r\neast of us. I am not sure whether his work counts as an industry or a\r\ncraft. There is Frank's sawmill, as Nicole said. There are also a flour\r\nmill and a brewery, and a mason works at a limestone quarry nearby. And\r\nyour father is planning to set up a kiln on the estate, so we can build\r\na new Victoire of brick.\"\r\n\r\n\"How sick is my father?\" Auguste asked abruptly, dreading the answer he\r\nwould get.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Nicole, there are your children waiting to greet us,\" Grandpapa\r\ncried, as if he had not heard Auguste's question.\r\n\r\nWhere the road made a sharp turn and started upward on a higher level,\r\nstood a two-story frame building painted white. A sign over the door\r\nread, THE VICTOR VISITOR, F. HOPKINS, PUBr, PRINTING AND ENGRAVING.\r\nCARPENTRY.\r\n\r\nAuguste could hear the press clanking away inside the house as they\r\napproached. The three younger children, John, Rachel and Betsy, were\r\nlined up by the door, Rachel holding in her arms a baby that must be\r\nNicole and Frank's newest. Three of the older ones, Benjamin, Abigail\r\nand Martha, leaned out a window to wave to Auguste from the second\r\nstory. Auguste felt proud of himself, being able to remember all their\r\nnames and which was which.\r\n\r\nAs Guichard reined up the horse and pushed the brake lever on the\r\ncarriage, the sound of the press stopped and Frank came out through the\r\nopen door wiping his ink-stained hands on his leather apron. His\r\nforehead was shiny with sweat. The oldest son, Thomas, followed him,\r\npushing his hands down his own apron with the same gesture.\r\n\r\nAuguste climbed down from the carriage and took Frank's hand, then shook\r\nwith Thomas and the three little girls. The baby was Patrick, he\r\nlearned. He lightly rubbed Patrick's fine hair.\r\n\r\n\"No wonder the town's population grows so fast, Aunt Nicole,\" Auguste\r\nsaid with a smile. \"How many more do you think there will be for you and\r\nFrank?\"\r\n\r\nBut as he spoke, his pleasure at his aunt's handsome family was dimmed\r\nby the thought that if all white families were as fertile as this, there\r\nwas no hope at all for the red people.\r\n\r\n\"None, I hope,\" said Frank firmly. \"We've got too big a tribe as it is.\"\r\n\r\nAunt Nicole's face reddened again, and Auguste reminded himself that\r\nwhite women were generally reluctant to talk about pregnancy and\r\nchildbirth. Auguste recalled his mother, Sun Woman, speaking of a kind\r\nof tea that would keep a woman from getting pregnant. When he went back\r\nto Saukenuk he could find out more about it. He would surely come back\r\nhere to visit, and then he could tell Aunt Nicole about it. If white\r\nwomen knew about that tea, maybe there would be fewer whites in years to\r\ncome, and they would not have such a hunger for land.\r\n\r\nAs they drove on up the road to the top of the bluff, Auguste saw\r\nNicole's face brighten, and he turned to see what she was looking at. A\r\nblack buggy drawn by an old gray horse was coming toward them, having\r\njust rounded the bend in the road at the trading post palisade. Auguste\r\ncaught a glimpse of blond braids under a red and white checkered bonnet.\r\n\r\nNicole said, \"Auguste, here's a newcomer to our county. I think you'll\r\nenjoy meeting her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah yes,\" said Elysée. \"Reverend Hale and his daughter, Mademoiselle\r\nNancy. He came here over a year ago, Auguste, declared the town too\r\ncorrupt for his church and started holding services for the farmers out\r\non the prairie. They built him a church about five miles from town.\r\nPainted white, with a steeple one can see for miles. Its very simplicity\r\nmakes it beautiful.\"\r\n\r\nNicole said, \"As much could be said for Nancy.\"\r\n\r\nCurious, Auguste tried to see the face under the red and white bonnet.\r\nEvery day, and many times a day, he thought of Redbird and the joy they\r\nso briefly shared, but many of the young white women he had seen in the\r\npast six years had made his heart beat faster. Just last winter he'd\r\ngone with a group of his classmates to an elegant old house on Nassau\r\nStreet where he discovered that the body of a white woman, under her\r\nmany-layered dress, was in all important respects as interesting as the\r\nbody of a woman of his own people. Even though he planned to leave\r\nVictoire as soon as he could, he was eager to meet the new minister's\r\ndaughter.\r\n\r\nThe two carriages pulled side by side, and the drivers, Guichard and the\r\nReverend Hale, a slab-faced man dressed in black, reined up for the\r\ncustomary exchange of greeting.\r\n\r\n\"Reverend Hale, Miss Hale,\" Elysée said, \"may I present my grandson,\r\nAuguste de Marion.\"\r\n\r\nThe reverend stared at Auguste for a moment from under bushy brows\r\nbefore grunting an acknowledgment. Auguste suspected he had heard about\r\nhis parentage and was looking for traces of Indian blood.\r\n\r\n_Indian._ Auguste had never heard that word before he went to live among\r\nwhite people. His people were the Sauk, the People of the Place of Fire.\r\nAnd their allies were the Fox. And besides these there were Winnebago,\r\nPotawatomi, Chippewa, Kickapoo, Osage, Piankeshaw, Sioux, Shawnee--each\r\na separate people. And besides these, hundreds more, whose names\r\nhe did not even know. But the whites had one name for all these\r\npeoples--Indians. And that name, Grandpapa had explained to him with\r\ngentle irony, was altogether a mistake. The explorer Columbus had\r\nthought he had landed in India.\r\n\r\n_They do not even respect us enough to call us by an honest name._\r\n\r\nBut the sight of Nancy Hale drove the bitterness from his mind. Her\r\nbraids, emerging from her red and white bonnet and lying on either side\r\nof her white lace collar, were yellow as ripe corn, and her face, while\r\ntoo long for ideal beauty, was pink and clear. Her mouth was wide, and\r\nher teeth were white when she smiled at Nicole and Elysée. She looked\r\nstraight at Auguste for an instant, then she looked down, but in that\r\nmoment he saw eyes a vivid shade of blue, like the turquoise stone from\r\nthe Southwest he carried in his medicine bag.\r\n\r\n\"Visiting the members of your flock, are you, Reverend?\" Elysée asked.\r\nAuguste noticed that he put the tiniest humorous inflection on the word\r\n\"flock.\"\r\n\r\nHale's thick gray brows drew together as he nodded sourly. \"Trying to\r\nbring the Word to that wilderness you call a town.\"\r\n\r\nHere was an unhappy man, thought Auguste, whose life was dedicated to\r\npersuading those around him to be equally unhappy.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, yes,\" said Elysée with a broad smile. \"Quite a population of sheep\r\ngone astray in Victor.\"\r\n\r\n\"In all of Smith County,\" said Hale.\r\n\r\n_It must scandalize him to think that my mother is an Indian woman and\r\nthat my father, by the lights of this man, isn't even married to her._\r\n\r\nAuguste suddenly wanted to defy the disapproval he felt from the\r\nreverend. He jumped out of the carriage and in an instant was standing\r\non the road beside the minister's buggy. He swept off his high-crowned\r\nhat with the flourish he'd seen in New York and bowed deeply.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Hale,\" he said. \"Auguste de Marion. At your service.\"\r\n\r\nThe blood rose to Nancy Hale's cheeks.\r\n\r\n\"My pleasure, Mr. de Marion,\" she murmured. Her large blue eyes looked\r\nfrightened and her flush deepened, but she did not take her eyes away,\r\nand his gaze was locked to hers. His heart beat as hard as it had the\r\nfirst time he saw the White Bear.\r\n\r\n\"The Lord's work awaits us in Victor,\" said the Reverend Hale loudly.\r\n\"You really must excuse us.\" And without waiting for a reply he snapped\r\nthe reins of his buggy, and the old horse ambled off.\r\n\r\nAuguste stood in the road waiting to see if Nancy would glance back at\r\nhim. She did. Even at a distance and through dust he could see the blue\r\nof her eyes.\r\n\r\nElysée said, \"Well, Auguste, close your mouth, put your hat back on and\r\nget back up here.\"\r\n\r\n_I'm going to meet her again_, Auguste thought.\r\n\r\nHe still wanted just as much to go back to his people. He had not\r\nforgotten Redbird. By now, though, she had probably forgotten him. And\r\nso, what harm could there be in getting to know this white young lady a\r\nlittle better?\r\n\r\nThen their carriage was passing the log wall around the trading post. A\r\nshadow fell over his enjoyment at meeting Nancy Hale. He ran his finger\r\ndown the scar on his cheek.\r\n\r\n\"Is _he_ in there?\" he said abruptly to Nicole.\r\n\r\nHer face paled. \"He's down-- You know about what's going on in the Rock\r\nRiver country, don't you?\"\r\n\r\nAuguste stiffened. \"Has something happened to my people?\"\r\n\r\nHe saw Nicole close her eyes and sigh when he said \"my people.\"\r\n\r\n\"There has been trouble,\" said Elysée. \"Did no news reach you in New\r\nYork?\"\r\n\r\n_O Earthmaker, let them come to no harm._\r\n\r\nTwisting his hands in his lap, Auguste said, \"The New York papers only\r\nreport what happens on the eastern seaboard.\" He remembered now\r\noverhearing remarks by some of his fellow passengers on the _Virginia_\r\nabout \"Injun trouble.\" But he'd kept to himself on the trip up from St.\r\nLouis.\r\n\r\n_We steamed right past the mouth of the Rock River, and I never\r\nguessed!_\r\n\r\nElysée nodded. \"Well, your father insisted that no one write you about\r\nit. He feared it would distract you from your studies.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste felt a sudden flash of anger at Pierre de Marion. _He does want\r\nme to forget that I am a Sauk. Not even telling me when my people are in\r\ndanger._\r\n\r\nHe gripped Elysée's arm. \"What happened?\"\r\n\r\nNicole said, \"Frank has a correspondent who writes him regularly from\r\nFort Armstrong.\"\r\n\r\nThe American fort, Auguste remembered, was at the mouth of the Rock\r\nRiver, six miles downriver from Saukenuk.\r\n\r\nNicole went on, \"Black Hawk's band once again crossed the Mississippi to\r\nSaukenuk in the spring, even though the Army has told them over and over\r\nthat the land now belongs to the Federal government and they must not\r\nreturn to it. This time they found settlers actually living in some of\r\ntheir houses and farming their fields. Black Hawk drove them out. Black\r\nHawk's warriors destroyed settlers' cabins nearby, shot their horses\r\nand cows, told them to move away or be killed. Now Governor Reynolds has\r\ncalled up the militia to drive Black Hawk and his people out of\r\nIllinois. His proclamation says, 'Dead or alive.'\"\r\n\r\nAuguste's heart suddenly felt as if ice had formed around it.\r\n\r\nElysée said, \"And Raoul and most of his cronies have gone to join the\r\nmilitia.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste whispered, \"O Earthmaker, keep my people safe.\" The carriage had\r\nreached the top of the hill and was passing the front gate of the\r\ntrading post, shut and locked with a chain. He trembled at the thought\r\nof Redbird--Sun Woman--Owl Carver--Black Hawk--all the people he had\r\nknown and loved all of his life, facing the rifles of men like Raoul.\r\n\r\n\"I must go there now,\" he said in a low voice.\r\n\r\n\"You can't,\" Nicole said quickly. \"You can't get through the militia\r\nlines. You'd be shot.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste, fists clenched in his lap, shook his head. \"If they are in such\r\ndanger, how can I stay away? I _must_ be with them.\"\r\n\r\nElysée seized his wrist in a grip so powerful it startled him. \"Listen\r\nto me. You cannot help them. You simply can't get there before matters\r\nare settled, one way or another. And I am sure that when your chief\r\nBlack Hawk sees the size of the militia force, he will go peacefully\r\nback across the Mississippi. The Sauk and Fox have many young men. You\r\nare your father's only son. _He_ needs you now.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste's heart ached as he saw the plea in Grandpapa's eyes. How could\r\nhe deny the old man? And his father's need for the love of his son in\r\nhis last days.\r\n\r\nBut the thought of thousands of armed and angry whites going to drive\r\nhis people out of Saukenuk smote him like a war club. Grandpapa didn't\r\nknow Black Hawk; Black Hawk was not likely to yield peaceably. And\r\nwhether or not Auguste could be any use at Saukenuk, he had to be there.\r\n\r\nNicole said, \"At least see your father and talk to him before you decide\r\nwhat to do.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste nodded. \"Of course.\" He saw more pain in her face than he could\r\nbear to look at. He turned to stare out at the hills as the carriage\r\ncarried them to Victoire.\r\n\r\nNow they could see Victoire, the great stone and log house rising out\r\nof the prairie on its low hill. Elysée and Pierre liked to call it a\r\nchâteau, but Auguste had learned that it was nothing like the castles in\r\nthe land they had come from. And, much as he had marveled at Victoire\r\nwhen he first saw it, he had seen still bigger and finer houses in New\r\nYork. But it was still the grandest house north of the Rock River's\r\nmouth, and Auguste couldn't help feeling proud when he realized that the\r\nblood of the men who built it flowed in his own veins.\r\n\r\nTheir carriage rattled through the gateway in the split-log fence.\r\nAuguste saw with pleasure that the maple tree that shaded the south side\r\nof the house was bigger than ever.\r\n\r\nMost of the servants and field hands were gathered before the front door\r\nto greet Auguste. He remembered how they had assembled this way six\r\nyears ago, when Star Arrow first brought him here from Saukenuk.\r\n\r\nEvery time he thought of Saukenuk, of his beleaguered people surrounded\r\nby an enemy army, his breathing grew fast and shallow.\r\n\r\nBut he was frightened, too, by the silence of the house. It whispered of\r\nhis father's dying. He must face Pierre's death and suffer with him now.\r\nAuguste wanted to rush upstairs to Pierre and hold him tight. And also\r\nhe did not want to go into Pierre's room at all.\r\n\r\nAuguste and Elysée climbed the stairway from the great hall of the\r\nchâteau to Pierre's second-story bedroom, Nicole following. At the door\r\nAuguste hesitated, and Elysée stepped forward and firmly knocked. A\r\nwoman's voice called them in.\r\n\r\nAs Grandpapa pushed the door open, Auguste closed his eyes. He dreaded\r\nwhat he was about to see. His heart fluttered anxiously. Would there be\r\nanything, he wondered, he could do for his father?\r\n\r\nNow the door was fully open, and he saw the long, thin figure stretched\r\nout under a sheet on a canopied bed. Marchette was sitting with a basin\r\nof water on her knees. She had been wiping Pierre's face with a damp\r\ncloth.\r\n\r\nA flash of bright red caught Auguste's eye. On the floor by the bed was\r\na second basin, partly covered by a towel which, Auguste suspected,\r\nMarchette must have hastily thrown over it. But part of the towel had\r\nfallen into the basin, and blood was soaking into the white linen.\r\n\r\nA knot of grief filled Auguste's throat, blocking it so he could not\r\nspeak. He rushed to the bed.\r\n\r\nPierre lay on his back, his head propped up by pillows, his long nose\r\npointing straight at Auguste, his eyes turned toward him. His bony hands\r\nlooked very large, because his arms were so thin. Pierre's gray hair,\r\nwhat was left of it, spread out on the pillow.\r\n\r\nPierre lifted his head a little.\r\n\r\n\"Son. Oh, I am glad to see you.\"\r\n\r\nHe raised his hands, and Auguste, biting his lip, leaned over the bed\r\nand put his hands under his father's shoulders. He held Pierre close and\r\nfelt Pierre's hands come to rest on his back, light as autumn leaves.\r\nThey held each other that way for a moment.\r\n\r\nHis father felt so light, as if he was starving to death. Auguste\r\nreleased him and sat on the edge of the bed. He said the first thing\r\nthat came into his mind.\r\n\r\n\"Did you eat today, Father?\"\r\n\r\nPierre's voice was like the wind in dead branches. \"Marchette keeps me\r\nalive with clear soups. They are all that I can keep down.\"\r\n\r\nA half-empty bowl of broth, Auguste now saw, stood on a table beside the\r\nbed. Next to the soup lay a Bible bound in black leather, and Pierre's\r\nsilver spectacle case with its velvet ribbon.\r\n\r\nWhat would Sun Woman and Owl Carver do for a man this sick? What would\r\nthey feed him?\r\n\r\n\"Maybe I can help you, Father,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think anyone can help me, son,\" Pierre said. \"It's all right.\r\nJust having you here makes me feel better.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste had learned enough about cancer to be sure that Pierre's\r\ncondition was hopeless. Dr. Bernard--any of the other white physicians\r\nat New York Hospital--would say that nothing more could be done except\r\nto make the patient comfortable, give him laudanum perhaps, and wait for\r\nthe end.\r\n\r\nBut that was merely what white medicine had taught Auguste. White\r\ndoctors had sharp lancets to draw blood, scalpels to cut into sick\r\npeople's bodies, saws to cut off infected limbs. They had huge thick\r\nbooks listing hundreds of diseases and prescribing treatments for them.\r\nBut after spending many hours treating the sick in New York, Auguste had\r\nseen that there were many things the white physicians did not know how\r\nto do, had never even thought of doing. Perhaps greater hope for Pierre\r\nlay in the way of the shaman.\r\n\r\nAt the very least, Auguste, as White Bear, could speak to Pierre's\r\nsoul, could summon the aid of the spirits, especially his own spirit\r\nhelper and that of the sick man, to cure him if possible; if not, then\r\nto ease his suffering, help him to accept what was to happen to him and\r\nprepare him to walk in the other world.\r\n\r\nWith a jolt, the thought hit him anew: _If I stay here with Father, what\r\nof Saukenuk?_\r\n\r\nPierre said, \"God has kept me alive because I must talk to you about our\r\nland, Auguste.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste did not like the sound of that. The thousands of acres the de\r\nMarions owned had nothing to do with him, and he wanted to keep it that\r\nway.\r\n\r\nMarchette stood up, pushing her chair back. \"Perhaps the rest of us\r\nshould leave you and Monsieur Auguste alone.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste saw in her face the anguish of a woman who was losing a man she\r\nloved. Auguste had long suspected, seeing the looks that passed between\r\nPierre and Marchette, and the way her husband, the brown-bearded Armand,\r\nglared at both of them, that there was--or at least had once\r\nbeen--something between the master of Victoire and the cook.\r\n\r\nPierre raised a tremulous hand. \"Au contraire. I want the three of\r\nyou--Papa, Nicole, Marchette--to hear what I say. Besides, you are the\r\nthree I trust most. I want you to know my wishes, my true wishes,\r\nbecause after I am gone there are those who will lie about me.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste took Pierre's hand, so big and yet so weak, in his own strong,\r\nbrown one.\r\n\r\n\"Father, you must believe that you will live.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste heard the others move closer to the bed. Nicole went to stand at\r\nthe foot. Elysée seated himself in an old spindly-legged armchair\r\nbrought over from France, his cane across his knees.\r\n\r\nPierre pointed a skeletal finger above his head to a shelf mounted on\r\nthe white-painted plaster wall, where an Indian pipe lay, its bowl\r\ncarved of red pipestone, its stem polished hickory.\r\n\r\n\"Take down the calumet,\" Pierre said. \"Let me hold it.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste took the pipe reverently, with a hand at each end of its\r\nthree-foot length. Two black feathers with white tips fluttered from the\r\nbowl as he put the pipe into Pierre's hands. From the moment he touched\r\nthe pipe, Auguste's hands were shaking as much as Pierre's. Only he and\r\nPierre understood how much power was in this pipe--power to bind men\r\nfor life to whatever they promised when they smoked the sacred tobacco.\r\n\r\nPierre let the pipe lie on his chest, his fingers touching it lightly.\r\n\r\n\"This pipe was given me a few years after you were born, Auguste, by\r\nJumping Fish, who even then was one of the civil chiefs of the Sauk and\r\nFox. It is the sign of an agreement between our family and the Sauk and\r\nFox, fully understood and freely entered into by both sides.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste looked in wonderment from Pierre to Elysée, and Grandpapa nodded\r\nsolemnly.\r\n\r\nElysée said, \"We had spent years exploring the more unsettled parts of\r\nthe Illinois Territory, and we had decided that here was the land we\r\nwanted as our family seat in the New World. In 1809 we bought this land\r\nfor a dollar an acre at the Federal land office in Kaskaskia. Thirty\r\nthousand dollars. The Federal government claimed that the Sauk and Fox\r\nhad signed a treaty a few years earlier with Governor William Henry\r\nHarrison, selling fifty-one million acres, including all of northern\r\nIllinois, to the United States for a little over two thousand dollars, a\r\nshockingly paltry sum.\"\r\n\r\nPierre said, \"But we knew that the Sauk and Fox disputed that claim.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste said, \"Yes, Black Hawk says Harrison cheated the Sauk and Fox.\r\nHe says the chiefs who signed the treaty were drunk and could not speak\r\nEnglish or read or write it, and did not know what they were agreeing to\r\nwhen they made their marks. He says that anyway those chiefs had no\r\npermission from the tribe to sell any land.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly,\" said Elysée. \"And we wanted to live in peace with the Sauk\r\nand Fox. And that was why your father went to Saukenuk. We hoped to make\r\nreasonable payments for the land we would live on to those from whom it\r\nhad been taken.\"\r\n\r\nPierre said, \"I was still there with your mother, by my own choice, when\r\nwar broke out in 1812, and then they required me to stay with them. You\r\nwere already two years old. After the war, and after I left them, I sent\r\nthe Sauk and Fox chiefs what they asked for--thirty thousand dollars,\r\npartly in coin and partly in trade goods, knives, steel axes, tin pots\r\nand kettles, blankets and bolts of cloth, rifles and barrels of\r\ngunpowder, bags of bullets. So, we paid for this land twice over.\r\nDespite that, I think it is far more valuable still than all the money\r\nwe spent for it. The chiefs recognize our right to live on the land and\r\nuse it. And Jumping Fish gave me this calumet, and I gave him a fine\r\nKentucky long rifle with brass and silver inlay on the barrel and\r\nstock.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste nodded eagerly. \"Yes, yes, I've seen it. Jumping Fish uses it to\r\nshoot the first buffalo every winter to start the hunt.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I gave Black Hawk the compass your war chief still treasures, from\r\nwhich I received my Sauk name.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste looked across Pierre's bed and out the windows, of costly clear\r\nglass shipped from Philadelphia, that gave a view south across\r\ngrass-covered prairie. Once all that prairie belonged to my people, he\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nAs if knowing his thoughts, Pierre said, \"I did not say the Sauk and Fox\r\nsold us the land. I said they recognized our right to use it. Do you\r\nunderstand?\"\r\n\r\nAuguste nodded, repeating what he had so often heard Black Hawk say in\r\nthe tribal meetings. \"Land is not something to be bought and sold. So we\r\nbelieve.\"\r\n\r\nPierre closed his eyes wearily, his fingertips still resting on the\r\ncalumet that lay across his chest. Auguste grieved. The father who had\r\nleft him when he was a little boy and then come back for him was leaving\r\nhim again, slipping away. Marchette wiped Pierre's face with a damp\r\ncloth.\r\n\r\nNicole's lower lip trembled as she said, \"My big brother. You've always\r\nbeen here for me.\"\r\n\r\nElysée's face was crumpled by an unbearable sadness. He wishes, Auguste\r\nthought, that it was him lying there dying, instead of his son.\r\n\r\nPierre opened his eyes and lifted his head to look at Auguste. Auguste\r\ngently pressed his hand against his father's balding brow.\r\n\r\n\"Rest, Father, rest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not till we are done. You know that your grandfather turned the estate\r\nover to me when I was forty years of age. Now I must pass it on. Until\r\nrecent years I had thought that the land would go to Raoul when I died.\r\n\r\n\"But the enmity between me and Raoul has grown deeper and deeper. A few\r\ntimes he and I and Papa have met together, trying to come to terms. Each\r\ntime, the words that passed between us were more cruel. Then, a year\r\nago, he even boasted to me that he killed three Sauk Indians who were\r\ntaking lead from that mine he has been working, which they believe to be\r\ntheirs.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste gasped.\r\n\r\n_Sun Fish and the others! That must have been what happened to them._\r\n\r\nPierre said, \"What is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I know those three. One of them was my age, and a friend of\r\nmine.\" His hatred for Raoul burned fiercer than ever.\r\n\r\nPierre said, \"For a long time now there have been no words at all\r\nbetween Raoul and me.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste said, \"It was my coming here that turned you against each\r\nother.\"\r\n\r\nNicole spoke up. \"Not you. Raoul has had a grudge against Pierre for as\r\nlong as I can remember.\"\r\n\r\nElysée said, \"Yes, Raoul has many quarrels with me--over land and how it\r\nis to be used, our paying the Sauk and Fox for it, the Fort Dearborn\r\nmassacre. Yes, you are part of it, Auguste, but there is much more\r\nbesides.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste shook his head. \"But before I came, Father and Raoul were\r\nspeaking to each other and the question of who would get the estate was\r\nsettled. And it still can be. Father, after you are gone I will go back\r\nto my people. You can tell Raoul that, and there will be peace between\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nWith pain that tore all through him like lightning burning through a\r\ntree, Auguste realized that he had committed himself to stay here as\r\nlong as his father lived. His Sauk family and loved ones were in\r\nterrible danger four days' ride from here, and he wanted to be with\r\nthem. But he couldn't leave Pierre now. His fear for Sun Woman and\r\nRedbird and the others in peril, his shame at not going to help them,\r\nwould be a terrible torment, but he would have to endure it. He could\r\nnot leave his father to take his first steps on the Trail of Souls\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nPierre reached out suddenly and seized him by the wrist.\r\n\r\n\"You must not leave, even after I am gone. You must stay here as my\r\nheir.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste gasped as the enormity of what Pierre was saying hit him. Heir!\r\nHe tried to stand up, but Pierre's grip held him fast. Just as this\r\nhuge house and all the land around it would hold him captive, forever\r\nparted from his people.\r\n\r\n\"No!\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen, please, Auguste. I cannot will the land to Raoul.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste lifted his free hand pleadingly.\r\n\r\n\"You can't will it to _me_. I know nothing about managing farms and\r\nraising livestock. Nothing about business. Raoul has been trained from\r\nchildhood to do all the work of this estate. I can't do it, and I don't\r\nwant it.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked around the room, hoping the others would help him persuade\r\nPierre that what he wanted was impossible. Nicole and Marchette were\r\nboth wide-eyed and open-mouthed. Elysée leaned forward in his chair, his\r\neyes intent on Auguste.\r\n\r\nPierre said, \"Once the land is your responsibility, you will do what is\r\nright with it. I know you will. I want to turn the estate over to you\r\nnow, as Papa did with me, while I am still alive. I would be here to\r\nhelp you, for a little while. Your grandfather will advise you, as he\r\nhas advised me all these years. There will be others to help you.\r\nNicole, her husband, Marchette, Guichard.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste said, \"Grandpapa, tell him I can't do it.\"\r\n\r\nElysée, who had been sitting slumped and miserable in his\r\nfragile-looking armchair, roused himself and said, \"I knew your father\r\nwas going to propose this to you today, Auguste. This is what he wants.\r\nIt is no mere whim. He has been thinking about it for a long time. And\r\nit is not impossible. You have shown yourself capable of learning\r\nquickly. I can only promise you that if you take up the burden your\r\nfather offers you, I will be at your side to help you every way that I\r\ncan.\"\r\n\r\nFor a moment Elysée's words made Auguste's resolve waver. Thirty\r\nthousand acres, he thought. And the United States stole fifty million\r\nacres from my people. Should not one Sauk get some of it back?\r\n\r\nBut he had some idea of the crushing responsibility a huge estate would\r\nentail. It was absurd to think of himself occupying such a place.\r\n\r\n\"But Raoul is also your son, Grandpapa,\" he said. \"Don't you want him to\r\ninherit your land?\"\r\n\r\nElysée shook his head. \"Raoul is a murderer many times over, who has\r\nescaped punishment only because Smith County is on the frontier, where\r\nthere is no law. He hates Indians with a passion that is close to\r\nmadness. He is a crude, violent, greedy man. He shames our family. He is\r\nfar less worthy than you.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste felt anger boiling up under his dismay. Father and Sun Woman and\r\nOwl Carver and Black Hawk had promised him he would live among whites\r\nonly for a time and then go back to the Sauk. They had all smoked the\r\ncalumet, making that agreement sacred. He had lived for that homecoming,\r\nthrough these six years. He freed his wrist from Pierre's grip and held\r\nout his hands, pleading for understanding.\r\n\r\n\"But I can't stay here with white people for the rest of my life.\"\r\n\r\nPierre said, \"You are not the same person you were when I took you out\r\nof the forest. You have been educated. You may yet become a doctor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and I want to be a doctor for my people.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can do more for them if you stay here, my son. The Sauk will need\r\nfriends among the whites who have knowledge and wealth and power.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste shook his head violently, as if to drive out Pierre's words. \"I\r\nwill never be happy, living as a white man. I must go back to my people.\r\nI beg you to let me go.\"\r\n\r\nBut even as he spoke he realized with a sudden pang that these loved\r\nones, Pierre, Grandpapa, Nicole, were his people too.\r\n\r\nPierre's sunken eyes blazed at Auguste. \"I have already written my new\r\nwill, Auguste. There is one copy with the town clerk, Burke Russell, and\r\none copy in your grandfather's keeping. It names you my sole heir. To\r\nall that I possess, the entire de Marion estate. If you accept what I am\r\noffering you, you will have to fight Raoul. It will all be upon your\r\nshoulders. I can only beg you with these last breaths to take what I\r\nwould give you. You must decide.\"\r\n\r\nA voice inside Auguste screamed, _You must not do this to me, Father.\r\nYou will destroy me._\r\n\r\nHe stood looking down at his father with his arms hanging at his sides,\r\nhis shoulders straight, his head bowed. He could not say no so finally,\r\nso bluntly, to his dying father. He needed time to work his way free of\r\nthis trap.\r\n\r\n\"Father, you know we Sauk never decide quickly. When it is a very\r\nimportant decision, we think, we go on with our work, we walk the\r\nsunwise circle, we wait in silence for the answer to come. You must give\r\nme time.\"\r\n\r\nPierre closed his eyes and his head fell back to the white pillows. \"You\r\nhave as much time as I do,\" he whispered. \"But only that much.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste turned away from the bed. His eyes met Nicole's. He saw sympathy\r\nfor him in her face, but only another shaman could know the pain he was\r\nfeeling inside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9\r\n\r\nBequest\r\n\r\n\r\nWhite Bear crouched over the brown blanket he had brought down from his\r\nroom and unrolled it. Bare-chested and barefoot in white sailcloth\r\nworkman's trousers he had bought in New York, he took from the blanket\r\nroll his powerful necklace of megis shells and hung it around his neck.\r\nNext he opened his soft leather medicine bag.\r\n\r\nPropped up against the big old maple tree on the south side of Victoire,\r\nPierre lay on his mattress with his head and shoulders resting on\r\npillows. His cotton blanket, all he needed on this warm September day,\r\nwas tucked around his chest, leaving his arms free. He had begged to be\r\ntaken outside; the weather was so fine. As soon as the servants had\r\ncarried him out and left him and White Bear alone, he had fallen asleep.\r\nThese days, Pierre slept most of the time, as a baby would. But a baby\r\nslept to build up its strength, Pierre because he was losing strength.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear--he did not think of himself as Auguste now--laid out the\r\nobjects from his medicine bag on the unrolled blanket and contemplated\r\nthem. They represented the seven sacred directions. First, East. He\r\npicked up a sparkling white rock and placed it on the east side of the\r\ntree. The color of East was white and therefore was White Bear's own\r\ncolor. Next was South. He took up the green stone on which the mound\r\nbuilders had long ago carved the figure of a winged man. This he laid on\r\nthe earth next to the mattress on Pierre's left side. The ground under\r\nthe maple tree was bare, and an early morning rain had left it damp and\r\nsoft.\r\n\r\nNow West. The spirits of men and women went West when they died, and the\r\ncolor of West was red. He set the red stone, with dark honeycomb\r\nmarkings that looked as if they had been painted on its highly polished\r\nsurface, on the ground at Pierre's feet. By the north side of the\r\nmattress he placed a black stone, itself from the North, that Owl Carver\r\nhad engraved with an owl image. The fifth direction, Up, was blue, and\r\nhe put a blue stone, the color of Nancy Hale's eyes, on the pillow\r\nbeside Pierre's head. He set a piece of brown sandstone for the sixth\r\ndirection, Down, beside Pierre's blanket-covered feet.\r\n\r\nNow for the seventh sacred direction--Here. He picked up the last and\r\nlargest item from his medicine bag--the claw of a grizzly bear that had\r\nbeen killed by Black Hawk himself many years ago. After White Bear had\r\ncome back from his first spirit quest with the prediction that Black\r\nHawk would do deeds of courage and that his name would never be\r\nforgotten, the war chief had made him a gift of the grizzly claw. White\r\nBear laid the saber-shaped claw on Pierre's chest, over his heart, with\r\nthe brown tip toward the cancerous lump in Pierre's belly that was\r\nkilling him.\r\n\r\nHe went back to his blanket and took out a dried gourd painted black and\r\nwhite. Slapping the gourd against the palm of his hand to make it\r\nrattle, he danced in a circle around Pierre and the maple tree, sunwise\r\nfrom east to south to west to north and back to east again, keeping\r\nPierre on his right, singing softly, almost to himself:\r\n\r\n    \"Earthmaker, you made this man,\r\n    Now we ask your help for him.\r\n    He is a chief whose people need him.\r\n    He still has far to walk.\r\n    Lift him up, Earthmaker.\r\n    Give him back his life.\"\r\n\r\nWhen White Bear had danced the circle nine times, he put down the gourd.\r\nHe had brought out from the château a kettle of freshly brewed\r\nwillow-bark tea and a porcelain cup. It would ease the pain in Pierre's\r\nstomach and give him strength. Whenever Pierre ate solid food, blood\r\nwould come trickling out of every opening in his body and he would grow\r\nweaker and paler. He was slowly bleeding and starving to death.\r\n\r\nSmelling the tea as he poured it into the cup, White Bear remembered how\r\nhe'd met Nancy Hale when he was collecting the bark yesterday along the\r\nbank of Red Creek. She'd been blueberrying. It was the fourth or fifth\r\ntime he'd encountered her over the summer on the prairie near Victoire.\r\nThe meetings weren't accidents; not for either of them. But he felt so\r\nuncertain about what he would do when Pierre died that he could only\r\ntalk with Nancy about things of no importance.\r\n\r\nHe looked up to see his father's eyes open. They had sunk so far back in\r\nthe skull-like face that they seemed like embers glowing in caves.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear blew on the steaming cup and held it to Pierre's lips. He\r\ndrank the tea down in small sips.\r\n\r\nPierre smiled faintly as his eyes traveled over his land. The nearby\r\nground, covered with grass cropped short by sheep and goats, sloped down\r\nto the split-rail fence that surrounded the château's inner yard. To the\r\nwest White Bear could see the two flags flying over Raoul's trading post\r\non the bluff overlooking the river, and beyond that part of the river\r\nand the dark west bank, the Ioway country. In the other directions were\r\norchards, farmlands, pastures, and the prairie, yellowing with fall,\r\nrolling on to the edge of the sky.\r\n\r\nWhen Pierre had drunk most of the tea, White Bear put down the cup. He\r\ngathered up his sacred stones and put them back in his medicine bag.\r\n\r\nPierre said, \"You did a Sauk ritual for me just now, did you not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said White Bear. \"It was meant to heal you. Or, if not, to give\r\nyou strength to bear the pain.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do feel better today,\" Pierre said. \"But I must also have a certain\r\nrite of the Church if I am to pass over into God's love. I sent a week\r\nago to Kaskaskia for your old teacher, Père Isaac. He should be here any\r\nday. I have been a great sinner, White Bear.\"\r\n\r\nIt gladdened White Bear's heart that his father called him by his Sauk\r\nname.\r\n\r\n\"You are a _good_ man, my father,\" he said in the Sauk tongue.\r\n\r\nPierre raised his head, and White Bear saw that the effort pained him.\r\nThe burning, sunken eyes turned on White Bear.\r\n\r\n\"Son, I must have my answer now. Earthmaker let me live all summer,\r\nthat you might have time to decide. Now you must tell me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you not let me go back to my people, Father? Why do you ask me to\r\nstay here and fight for something I do not want?\"\r\n\r\n\"I see what Raoul has become, and I do not want him to be the master\r\nhere. I am proud of you and ashamed of him. I want you to be the future\r\nof the de Marions, not him. And what of this land that we have loved\r\ntogether, the land that Sun Woman's people have cherished for\r\ngenerations? Shall it fall to Raoul?\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear remembered what Owl Carver had said to Pierre at Saukenuk:\r\n_If your land keeps you from doing what you want, then it owns_ you.\r\n\r\n\"Why couldn't you will the estate to Nicole? She's a de Marion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nicole cannot do battle with Raoul when she has eight children to care\r\nfor. Her husband is an excellent man, but not a fighter. White Bear, you\r\nare the only one.\"\r\n\r\n\"I still think as a Sauk, Father. Among the Sauk one man may not own\r\nland. And to claim so much would be a great crime.\"\r\n\r\n\"In you the heritage of the de Marions and the Sauk claim to this land\r\nare indissolubly united. You will be doing this for the Sauk as well as\r\nfor me and for yourself. I believe that it was God's plan that I father\r\nyou, that you spend the first fifteen years of your life among the Sauk\r\nand then these past six as a white. Now you have a chance to be rich and\r\nto have power. You can learn how to use your wealth to protect your\r\npeople. You can do much for them if you stay here and fight for what I\r\ngive you.\"\r\n\r\nStanding over his father, White Bear lifted his head and gazed up at the\r\ngreat stone and log house on the hilltop. He wondered whether he was not\r\nbeing foolishly stubborn, refusing Victoire and the land the château\r\ngoverned.\r\n\r\nPierre looked sad and weak and very old. All summer long White Bear,\r\nheartbroken, had watched him suffer and diminish. He knew he could do\r\nnothing to cure his father, and that his refusal to give him the answer\r\nhe wanted to hear was prolonging his pain. White Bear felt he would\r\nagree to anything, if only it would give peace.\r\n\r\nLooking into his father's pleading face, he saw that Pierre was using up\r\nhis last strength. White Bear could not let the final word Pierre might\r\nhear from him be no.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear could no longer separate his own anguish from Pierre's.\r\n\r\nHe drew a deep breath in through his nostrils. \"Yes, Father. I agree. I\r\nwill take what you offer me.\"\r\n\r\nThe look on Pierre's face was like a sunrise. White Bear saw a warm,\r\npink color flowing back into the pallid cheeks.\r\n\r\nPierre took White Bear's hand. His touch felt cool, but his grip was\r\nfirm.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, my son. I will walk the Trail of Souls with a happy heart.\"\r\n\r\n_Yes, you will go in peace, but I must stay to fight and suffer_, White\r\nBear thought. But he was glad that he could make his father happy. He\r\nleaned back against the tree and watched huge white clouds drift over\r\nthe distant river.\r\n\r\n\"Let us make this a sacred agreement, son,\" Pierre said. \"Bring the\r\ncalumet and let us smoke together.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Father.\" White Bear sighed and stood up. Slowly, as if he were\r\ndragging chains, he walked up the grassy slope to the front door of the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nAs he passed through the great hall he saw Armand Perrault, seeming\r\nalmost as broad as he was tall, staring at him. Armand's eyes were as\r\nsmall and full of hatred as a cornered boar's. Feeling a chill,\r\nrealizing this man was one of those he would have to fight when the time\r\ncame, White Bear nodded to him as he went up the stairs to Pierre's\r\nroom. Armand stood motionless.\r\n\r\nA short time later White Bear was back at Pierre's side with the\r\nfeather-bedecked calumet and a lit candle protected by a glass chimney.\r\nFrom his own room he had brought down the deerskin pouch holding his\r\nsmall supply of Turkish tobacco, purchased in New York. It would serve.\r\nAll tobacco was a sacred gift of Earthmaker.\r\n\r\nHe dribbled the moist brown grains through his fingertips into the\r\npipe's narrow bowl and packed the tobacco down gently. Pierre's faded\r\nblue eyes, the whites a sickly yellow color, watched him closely.\r\n\r\nHe held the candle flame to the tobacco and drew in a series of rapid\r\npuffs, feeling the smoke burning his mouth. When the pipe was well-lit,\r\nhe turned it and held the mouthpiece to Pierre's lips.\r\n\r\nPierre took a long puff, held it in his mouth and let it out. White\r\nBear's heart lurched with fear as Pierre began to cough. Holding his\r\nthroat with one hand, Pierre gestured with his other hand for White Bear\r\nto draw on the pipe.\r\n\r\nThe sight of beads of blood on his father's lips horrified White Bear.\r\nHe took a corner of Pierre's blanket and wiped away the bright red\r\ndrops. Then he took the pipe from his father's hands.\r\n\r\nGrieving for the freedom he was giving up, he pulled the hot smoke in\r\ntill it filled his mouth. He let its bitterness sink into his tongue as\r\nbitterness sank into his heart--the realization that this promise would\r\ncut him off forever from Redbird, from Sun Woman, from Owl Carver, from\r\nthe life he longed to return to. He let the smoke out with a long sigh\r\nand laid the pipe down. He felt as if his life was over.\r\n\r\nBut he felt some relief, too, because he was no longer torn by\r\nindecision. Now Pierre and he were content to talk of small things--how\r\nfull the corn bins were this year, what White Bear had seen and heard in\r\nNew York City, whether it would rain again tomorrow.\r\n\r\nPierre's voice grew softer and softer, and gradually he drifted off to\r\nsleep. His grip on White Bear's hand was still strong. White Bear let\r\nhis head rest against the tree trunk and returned to a favorite\r\nchildhood pastime, trying to see animal shapes in the clouds.\r\n\r\nHe was not surprised when the Bear appeared at his side. The huge head,\r\ncovered with fur white as the clouds, pushed past him, poking its black\r\nnose into Pierre's shoulder. Somehow White Bear knew that Pierre would\r\nfeel no fear when he awoke, even though he had never seen the Bear\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nPierre's eyes opened, and he looked up at the Bear and, as White Bear\r\nhad expected, only sighed and smiled.\r\n\r\n\"Eh bien, je suis content.\" And Pierre got to his feet as easily as if\r\nhe had never been sick.\r\n\r\nPierre did not say good-bye, but White Bear had not expected him to.\r\nThey had said their good-byes already. White Bear remained where he was,\r\nsitting with his back to the maple tree.\r\n\r\nWith his left hand lifted to rest on the high hump at the Bear's\r\nshoulder, Pierre walked down the slope. White Bear saw, rising from the\r\nrim of the hill, the arc of a rainbow.\r\n\r\nPierre walked the rainbow path with the long, vigorous stride of a young\r\nman. The Bear accompanied him with a rolling gait, looking like the\r\nbiggest dog that ever lived walking beside a hunter. White Bear smiled\r\nto watch them.\r\n\r\nThey climbed the archway of color that leaped out over the Great River\r\nuntil at last they disappeared in the dazzling disk of the sun.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear's head fell back against the bark of the tree, and he closed\r\nhis eyes.\r\n\r\nWhen he opened them again, his father was lying beside him, still\r\nholding his hand. But Pierre's grip was without strength. He lay with\r\nhis head sunk in the pillow, his mouth fallen open, the whites of his\r\neyes showing between half-closed lids. He was not breathing.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear's tears came hot. He heard a voice--his own voice--rising in\r\nhis chest.\r\n\r\n\"Hu-hu-huuuu ... Whu-whu-whuuuu ...\" It was the sound mourners made at\r\nSauk funerals.\r\n\r\nHe wrapped his arms around his knees and rocked back and forth, sobbing\r\nand keening in the way of his people. Soon he would have to get up and\r\ngo into the château and tell people Pierre de Marion was dead. He must\r\nbe the first to bring the news to poor Grandpapa. But for a while he\r\nwould sit alone with his father and wail for him.\r\n\r\nSitting on the ground under the maple tree, he looked down and was not\r\nsurprised to see marks in the bare, damp earth. The prints of wide pads\r\ntwice the size of a man's feet. At the end of each print, deep holes\r\nleft by five claws.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRaoul did not think he could put up with much more of this funeral. He\r\nhad to wait till it was all over before he could make himself master of\r\nVictoire, and he wanted desperately to act now. He tried to calm himself\r\nby remembering the Indians he'd stalked and killed at Saukenuk last May\r\nand June.\r\n\r\nRaoul and the fifty men he'd recruited to represent Smith County in the\r\nstate militia had arrived at the Rock River in style, carried up the\r\nMississippi from Victor to Fort Armstrong, at the mouth of the Rock\r\nRiver, on Raoul's new steamer _Victory_. Paid for with the profits of\r\nthe lead mine, the _Victory_ was propelled by two side paddle wheels,\r\nand it could make the St. Louis-Galena round trip in exactly a week.\r\n\r\nThey'd come to hunt Indians and Raoul had made sure they did, camping in\r\nthe woods on the south side of the Rock River opposite the Indian\r\nvillage and shooting at redskins whenever they had a chance. It pleased\r\nRaoul to think they'd gotten half a dozen, maybe more.\r\n\r\nFinally fed up with talking, General Gaines had ordered a general\r\nassault on Black Hawk's town at the end of June. The militia were eager\r\nto slaughter every Indian in Saukenuk, and they'd swept in.\r\n\r\nAnd the damned, sneaking redskins were gone. Seeing themselves\r\noutnumbered, they'd slipped out of the village, down the Rock River and\r\nacross the Mississippi the night before. The Smith County boys, along\r\nwith the other militiamen, were in a fury of frustration. They had to be\r\ncontent with the poor-second satisfaction of burning the Indian town to\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\nTo Raoul's great annoyance, instead of pursuing Black Hawk, Gaines sent\r\na message to the chief asking for yet another parley. Black Hawk and\r\nsome of his braves came back across the river to talk peace. Just like\r\nhe hadn't shown the whole world what a coward he really was, the\r\nstubborn old Indian had marched up to Gaines's tent walking like a\r\npeacock, with feathers in his hair.\r\n\r\n_Hang the redskinned son of a bitch_, was what Raoul thought. Instead,\r\nGaines just made him sign another fool treaty--as if the Indians ever\r\nhonored any treaties--and even promised to send them corn because they\r\nhadn't had time to plant any.\r\n\r\nThe disgusted militiamen called it the Corn Treaty. Old Gaines must be\r\nalmost as big a coward as Black Hawk.\r\n\r\nRaoul and the Smith County boys hung around the Rock River, sniping at\r\nIndians in canoes till their provisions ran out; they flagged the\r\n_Victory_ down on her next northbound trip and rode her home.\r\n\r\nHome, where what was going on made Raoul madder than ever. Pierre was\r\ndying and the mongrel--from the same tribe Raoul had been fighting down\r\non the Rock River--was strutting around as if he already owned Victoire.\r\n\r\nThat would end today. If Raoul could pull it off.\r\n\r\nRaoul eyed Nancy Hale, standing only a few feet from him among the two\r\nhundred or so mourners in the great hall of Victoire. What would she\r\nthink, Raoul wondered, when he played his hand today? He pictured what\r\nthe tall blond woman would look like naked under him in bed.\r\n\r\nOh, he'd make her sweat and moan and thank him for it.\r\n\r\nBut first, of course, he had to succeed today. He had to drive the\r\nmongrel away before he could court Nancy. Whether her preacher father\r\napproved of him or not, he couldn't turn away one of the biggest\r\nlandowners in Illinois.\r\n\r\nAnd that's what he'd be, after today.\r\n\r\nHe didn't see how he could fail. Surely the servants and the townspeople\r\nwouldn't take the mongrel's part.\r\n\r\nStill warming himself by staring at Nancy Hale's straight back, Raoul\r\nthanked God he'd never been quite able to bring himself to marry\r\nClarissa.\r\n\r\nHe felt a twinge of unease as he recalled that taking up with Nancy\r\nwould mean kicking Clarissa out of his bed, and _that_ might mean\r\ntrouble with Eli. To his relief, Eli had accepted Raoul's not marrying\r\nClarissa, even after she bore him two kids. But that was only because\r\nEli figured it would happen eventually, maybe after Raoul got control of\r\nthe estate.\r\n\r\nWell, once he had the estate, he comforted himself, he could see that\r\nClarissa and their two out-of-wedlock boys were well taken care of.\r\n\r\nIt galled Raoul to be so dependent on a man like Eli, to be--he hated to\r\nadmit it to himself--afraid of him. A heap depended on Eli's playing his\r\npart today in helping him get control of the estate. Today, Eli would be\r\nleading the Smith County boys, ones who'd been at the Rock River last\r\nJune. Having been offered a good day's pay, they would do a little more\r\nIndian fighting.\r\n\r\nRaoul felt as if he were going to burst. He couldn't stand this waiting,\r\nwhile the priest droned on in singsong Latin at the linen-covered table\r\nthat had been set up as an altar before the fireplace. Let the fight\r\nbegin, for God's sake.\r\n\r\n_Indians are all cowards at heart. When I take over here, Pierre's\r\nprecious little red bastard will slink away, like Black Hawk did last\r\nsummer._\r\n\r\nA chill spread across Raoul's back as he asked himself: What if Auguste\r\ndoesn't slink away? He might try to rally the servants and some of the\r\ntownspeople to fight for him.\r\n\r\nThey wouldn't fight for a mongrel bastard. People hated Indians. Look\r\nhow many men rushed down to the Rock River to fight Black Hawk.\r\n\r\nBut many people had loved Pierre. This hall was filled, and there were\r\nmore people outside who couldn't get in because there wasn't room. All\r\nof them paying their last respects to Pierre. And they knew that Pierre\r\nwanted Auguste to take his place. Would any of them fight to see that\r\nPierre's will was done?\r\n\r\nHe felt colder still as he considered the odds. Just about every man in\r\nSmith County had his own rifle or pistol. And Raoul and the men he'd\r\nrecruited for today were far outnumbered. He wished he had hired more\r\nmen. But too many and the secret would be out, and then Auguste would be\r\nready for him.\r\n\r\nRaoul tried to calm himself. Everyone in Smith County might be armed, he\r\nreasoned, but not everyone wanted to use their weapons. A lot of men\r\nwouldn't fight unless their backs were to the wall. It was the ones who\r\nwere willing to fight who got to give orders to the rest. The men Raoul\r\nhad picked, Eli and Hodge and the rest of them, were born fighters.\r\n\r\nThere'd be those who would condemn him, he thought, for seizing the land\r\nthe very day of his brother's funeral. It was indecent, he admitted to\r\nhimself. But he had no choice. He couldn't allow Auguste to get his feet\r\nplanted firmly. He couldn't allow Pierre's will to be read aloud.\r\n\r\nHe felt even better when he remembered that with Pierre dead the\r\nservants would be taking their orders from Armand. He looked around the\r\nhall for the overseer. There he was, near the door, most of his face\r\nburied by his thick brown beard. Armand's wife, Marchette, was standing\r\nnext to him. Sporting a black eye, Raoul noticed with amusement.\r\n\r\nArmand Perrault was one who didn't love Pierre.\r\n\r\nThat sanctimonious hypocrite Pierre. First the squaw, the mongrel's\r\nmother. Then he marries Marie-Blanche, and as soon as she dies, he's\r\nputting it to the cook.\r\n\r\nRaoul took a deep breath of relief when he saw that Père Isaac had\r\nfinally finished with the funeral mass. The old Jesuit was again\r\nsprinkling holy water on the black-painted coffin, heaped with wreaths\r\nof roses and chrysanthemums that lay on trestles in the center of the\r\nhall. Frank Hopkins, Raoul knew, had built that coffin of oak planks.\r\n\r\nOld red-nosed Guichard came up to Raoul. \"Your father requests that you\r\nbe one of those who carries your brother's coffin to the wagon.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul felt a momentary jolt of fear. Help pick up Pierre's coffin and\r\ncarry it, when he was about to dispossess Pierre's son? If he laid a\r\nhand on Pierre's coffin, God might strike him dead. Or Pierre's ghost\r\nwould rise up against him.\r\n\r\nHe shook his head. Fool's thinking.\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't have it any other way, Guichard.\"\r\n\r\nHe was angered to see Auguste standing opposite him when he went to the\r\nhead of the coffin. It was infuriating to see Pierre's features in that\r\nbrown-skinned face. The half-breed was wearing a green clawhammer\r\njacket, with a black silk band around the left arm.\r\n\r\nHis arms and back strained as they took the weight of his corner of the\r\ncoffin. A chorus of grunts arose from Raoul, Auguste, Armand, Frank\r\nHopkins, Jacques Manette and Jean-Paul Kobell as they hoisted the coffin\r\nto their shoulders. They trudged out the door with it and slid it on the\r\nbed of a flower-bedecked farm wagon. Guichard helped Elysée climb up on\r\nthe wagon. A snap of the old servant's whip started the two horses\r\nmoving, as black ribbons tied to their harnesses fluttered.\r\n\r\nRaoul walked alone, following the cart the half mile south along the\r\nbluffs to the burial ground. Some of the hands had cut a track through\r\nthe shoulder-high prairie grass for the funeral procession to follow.\r\nThe fiddler Registre Bosquet marched right behind the wagon playing\r\nhymns, and the servants sang in French.\r\n\r\nRaoul cast his eye back over the long line of people following the\r\ncoffin. His glance slid past Nicole and Frank and their passel of kids.\r\nWith a feeling of satisfaction he saw two of his key men walking near\r\nthe end of the procession, Justus Bennett, the county land commissioner,\r\nand Burke Russell, the county clerk. One copy of Pierre's will was in\r\nRussell's keeping, and Raoul had already told him what to do with that.\r\nRussell's wife, Pamela, was walking beside him, a handsome woman with\r\nchestnut hair that she didn't braid as most women did but allowed to\r\nfall in soft waves under her broad-brimmed hat. Strongly attracted to\r\nher himself, Raoul wondered how a bespectacled weakling like Burke\r\nRussell had ever been able to attract such a fine-looking woman. And\r\nwhat she'd do if she had a sporting proposition from an equally\r\nfine-looking man.\r\n\r\nThey were at the cemetery now. Raoul liked this hillside rising out of\r\nthe bluffs, where Pierre's wife, Marie-Blanche, lay overlooking the\r\nbottomland and the river. The graves of about a dozen others who had\r\nworked and died at Victoire were surrounded by a low split-rail fence.\r\nTall cedar trees shadowed the white gravestones. The flat markers with\r\ntheir rounded tops, names, dates and inscriptions were chiseled by\r\nWarren Wilgus, the mason who'd recently moved into the area. Auguste had\r\nalready made arrangements to have Pierre's headstone carved.\r\n\r\nThe sight of a solid limestone cube in the center of the cemetery gave\r\nRaoul a twinge of guilt, as it always did. It was the first stone to\r\nhave been placed in the cemetery, and was a memorial to his mother,\r\nEstelle de Marion, who was buried not here but in Kaskaskia, where she\r\nhad died in 1802 giving birth to him.\r\n\r\n_It wasn't my fault!_\r\n\r\nHelene was also remembered, though not buried here. The Indians had\r\nthrown her poor, mutilated body into Lake Michigan. Her memorial marker\r\nstood next to Maman's stone. A carved angel spread his wings over\r\nHelene's name and dates, \"HELENE DE MARION VAILLANCOURT, Beloved\r\nDaughter and Sister. 1794-1812. She sings before the throne of God.\"\r\nBelow that were inscribed the name and dates of her husband, Henri\r\nVaillancourt, whose body also had never been found.\r\n\r\nRaoul carried inside himself his own inscription for Helene: _Murdered\r\nby Indians, August 15, 1812. She will be avenged._\r\n\r\nAnd one act of vengeance would take place today, when the half-Sauk\r\nmongrel, whose presence was an affront to Helene, was thrown off this\r\nland.\r\n\r\nIt gave Raoul an uneasy feeling to be working with Auguste, lifting\r\nPierre's coffin off the wagon. It might be bad luck. But the time to\r\nstrike had not yet come, so he had to walk beside Auguste carrying the\r\ncoffin to the newly dug grave. There, crouching in unison, the six\r\npallbearers laid the coffin on a cradle of two ropes, each end held by\r\ntwo servants, over the oblong pit. Bending to let his burden down hurt\r\nRaoul's back, and he glanced over at Auguste, hoping to see him having\r\ntrouble. But the mongrel's dark face was impassive.\r\n\r\nWhen Raoul saw Elysée shuffling through the gate, leaning on his\r\nsilver-headed walking stick, he felt a new tingle of dread. How would\r\nhis father greet the move he was going to make? Except for a few brief\r\nand bitter meetings at which he and Papa and Pierre had tried and failed\r\nto settle their differences, he had not spoken to his father in six\r\nyears. Armand often brought infuriating news of the old man's growing\r\nfondness for the mongrel, making Raoul hate the redskinned bastard all\r\nthe more. Elysée would hardly be happy with what he did today, of\r\ncourse. But would Papa try to fight his only surviving son? If he did,\r\nRaoul would have to fight back, and then he might be punished by God.\r\n\r\n_Nonsense. God doesn't side with Indians. What I am doing is right,\r\nbecause Pierre was seduced and deluded._\r\n\r\nBut it wouldn't hurt to try to get in good with the old man. Raoul\r\nwalked quickly over to him.\r\n\r\n\"Take my arm, Papa.\"\r\n\r\nElysée looked up at him, his eyes bloodshot and red-rimmed, his face\r\nblank, his skin wrinkled parchment.\r\n\r\n_The old man's had his share of grief. Too bad he couldn't find reason\r\nto be happy with me. But that's his fault._\r\n\r\nIn a low, hoarse voice Elysée said, \"Thank you, son. It was good of you\r\nto come today.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul sensed an accusation.\r\n\r\n\"Why wouldn't I come to my own brother's funeral?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because you hated him,\" Elysée said softly.\r\n\r\nAt least the old man didn't seem to suspect that he had another reason\r\nfor being here today. Containing his anger, Raoul helped his father walk\r\nto the grave. There he left Elysée with Guichard and went around to\r\nstand facing north, where he could see the château.\r\n\r\nHis nagging fear eased a little. So far he had seen no sign that he\r\nwould meet with any opposition. It was hard to believe that the mongrel\r\nand his supporters could be planning anything in secret. Still he knew\r\nhis heart would not slow down till this was all over.\r\n\r\nPère Isaac stood at the head of Pierre's grave, next to Marie-Blanche's\r\ntombstone. A faint breeze from the river didn't disturb his gray-black\r\nhair or his beard, but rustled the tassels of the purple stole around\r\nhis neck, the winglike sleeves of his white surplice and his\r\nankle-length black cassock.\r\n\r\nTrying to hold still as his heart pounded and his hands trembled, Raoul\r\nwatched Père Isaac shake holy water over the coffin, which now lay at\r\nthe bottom of the grave. The priest gave his sprinkler to one of the\r\nboys assisting him, opened a prayerbook bound in black leather and began\r\nthe graveside prayers.\r\n\r\n_Will this never end?_\r\n\r\nRaoul stood with his head bowed. He puzzled over what Elysée had said\r\nabout hating Pierre.\r\n\r\n_Papa always loved Pierre more than me. Thought I was some kind of\r\nsavage because I don't have all those French ways like him and Pierre.\r\nI'm the most American member of this family, and he should be proud of\r\nme._\r\n\r\n_I didn't hate Pierre. It was just this damn business of him caring more\r\nabout redskins than about his own people._\r\n\r\n_And he wasn't there when I needed him._\r\n\r\nRaoul found himself wishing he could talk to Pierre one last time, try\r\nto make him understand why he felt as he did and had to do the things he\r\ndid. Looking down at the coffin in the grave, Raoul thought back to the\r\nlast time he had seen Pierre. In early spring after the last of the snow\r\nmelted on the ground, out riding Banner on the prairie, alone, he'd come\r\nupon Pierre, also riding alone. They had stared at each other and passed\r\nwithout a word.\r\n\r\n_I didn't know then that was my last chance to speak to him._\r\n\r\nRaoul's eyes traveled over the people standing by the grave. Auguste\r\nstood between Elysée and Nicole, looking down into the pit. It pleased\r\nRaoul to see that apparently Auguste had no idea what was about to\r\nhappen to him.\r\n\r\nBut how could he be _sure_ Auguste was unprepared?\r\n\r\nRaoul looked over the heads of the mourners, and his heart beat faster\r\nwith anticipation. There, across the flat prairie land, he saw tiny\r\nfigures surrounding the château.\r\n\r\nRaoul's fingernails dug into his palms as he clenched his fists to hold\r\nhimself together. What if the secret had gotten out? If Auguste knew\r\nwhat was about to happen, he would surely have prepared some kind of\r\ncounterattack. Indians were damned sly.\r\n\r\nPère Isaac closed his prayerbook and put it into his coat pocket.\r\n\r\n\"This man whom we consign to American soil was, like so many of us, born\r\non the other side of the ocean,\" he said. \"He came of one of the oldest\r\nand noblest families of France, fleeing the Godless revolution that\r\ntormented their homeland, which was also my homeland. The de Marions\r\ngave themselves soul and body to this new land where they had to make\r\ntheir own way. Here titles and ancient lineage meant nothing.\"\r\n\r\n_Get on with it, dammit!_\r\n\r\n\"God saw fit to try them sorely after they came here to Illinois. The\r\nmother of the family died in childbirth. A daughter died a horrid death\r\nat the hands of Indians, and a son\"--he gestured at Raoul, who stared\r\nback at him, keeping his face expressionless--\"held captive, a slave, by\r\nIndians for two years.\"\r\n\r\nIt was good that Père Isaac mentioned that. It would prepare people to\r\naccept what was about to happen.\r\n\r\n\"Pierre de Marion was a good man, but he was also a sinner, like all of\r\nus. He fell into the sin of lust, and that sin bore fruit. But Pierre\r\ndid not hide his sin as so many men have. He reached out to his son\r\nthrough me and helped him. Eventually he acknowledged his son and\r\nbrought him out of the wilderness to be educated for civilization.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul looked across the open pit at Auguste. The half-breed's red-brown\r\nface was flushed an even darker color, but still he stared fixedly down\r\ninto the grave.\r\n\r\n_Time to start._\r\n\r\nIt was an immense relief to begin to move. First, he had to get back to\r\nthe château ahead of the funeral procession and join his men there.\r\nSlowly, so as not to attract attention, Raoul drew back from the\r\ngraveside.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAuguste's feet felt heavy and confined in his cowhide boots as they\r\ncrunched over the short stubble. He walked alone on the newly cut track\r\nback toward the great stone and log house. He could hear the sound of\r\nspades biting into the mound of dirt beside Pierre's grave and clods of\r\nearth thudding onto his coffin.\r\n\r\nAuguste led the procession of mourners. The others let him walk apart,\r\nto be alone with his grief. Behind Auguste, he was aware, were Nicole\r\nand Frank and Nancy Hale and Père Isaac, and then a long line of\r\nservants and farm hands and village people. Near the end of the\r\nprocession Registre Bosquet played a sprightly tune, as was the custom\r\namong the Illinois French, a way of saying that life goes on. In the\r\nrear was the cart that had carried Pierre's coffin, with Elysée and\r\nGuichard.\r\n\r\nAs Auguste walked, he brooded about Père Isaac calling him the fruit of\r\nsin. Why did the priest have to dishonor his mother and father so? In\r\nthe eyes of the Sauk people he was no \"bastard,\" as he knew some pale\r\neyes called him. Still, he was glad that the priest said Pierre had done\r\nthe right thing in bringing him here. Perhaps people would remember\r\nthat, when Raoul tried to take the estate away from him.\r\n\r\nAs he surely would.\r\n\r\nAuguste knew, with a sinking feeling in his stomach, that it was only a\r\nmatter of time before Raoul would strike at him.\r\n\r\nHe felt himself wishing for Black Hawk and Iron Knife and the other Sauk\r\nwarriors, even Wolf Paw, to be here to stand by him. And Owl Carver and\r\nSun Woman to advise him. Now he wished he had not agreed, at his\r\nfather's insistence, to have no contact with the band. While he was\r\nbeing educated, being cut off from them had helped him become more\r\nquickly a part of the white world. But now that Pierre was gone he felt\r\nso terribly alone.\r\n\r\nA chill fell over him like a cold downpour. Looking up, he saw men\r\nstanding just outside the fence that surrounded the château, strung out\r\nin a line along the west side, where the gateway was. He had noticed\r\nthem as he was leaving the graveyard, but had thought they must be\r\nhands, with field work of some sort important enough to keep them from\r\nthe funeral. Now he was close enough to see that they were carrying\r\nrifles. Auguste recognized Raoul himself standing squarely in the\r\ngateway. How had he gotten over there? Auguste had thought he was with\r\nthe funeral procession.\r\n\r\nA cold hollow opened in his stomach as he grasped what was happening.\r\n\r\n_The moment my father is buried. What a fool I was to think Raoul would\r\nwait awhile._\r\n\r\nHe heard people murmuring behind him.\r\n\r\n\"Oh my God,\" Nicole said. \"Not now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Auguste!\" It was Nancy's voice, shrill with fear. He shook his head,\r\ntrying to tell her that he would not turn back, and kept on walking.\r\n\r\nIn a moment, thought Auguste, he might be joining his father on the\r\nTrail of Souls. He heard footsteps behind him crunching on the dry\r\ngrass. It was a comfort to know that there were others near him,\r\nalthough he knew no one could really help him.\r\n\r\nHe had no idea what he would do. He asked Earthmaker to show him how to\r\nwalk this path with courage and honor.\r\n\r\nKeeping his stride firm and steady, Auguste went around the fence to\r\napproach the gate, glancing up at the maple tree under which Pierre had\r\ndied.\r\n\r\nAs Auguste got closer, Raoul threw open his jacket, showing his\r\ngilt-handled pistol holstered on one hip, his huge knife, the one that\r\nhad scarred Auguste, sheathed on the other. His eyes were shadowed by\r\nhis broad-brimmed black hat, and the black mustache hid his mouth. His\r\nface was a mask.\r\n\r\nWhen they were about ten feet apart, Raoul spoke. \"Now that my brother\r\nis in the ground I can speak plain to you. It's over for you here.\r\nYou're Pierre's natural son, and this is his burying day, so I won't\r\nkill you unless you force me to it. I want you off de Marion land right\r\nnow. I want you out of Smith County by sundown. Get back to the woods\r\nwhere you came from.\"\r\n\r\n_You cannot know how happy it would make me to do just that, Raoul._\r\nAuguste stood with his feet planted firmly on the stubble. He did not\r\ntry to think. He would rely on the spirits for help. He waited for the\r\nknowledge of what to do to come to him.\r\n\r\nHe felt people coming to stand beside him. He heard the creaking of\r\nwagon wheels and the soft clip-clop of horses' hooves as the cart\r\ncarrying Guichard and Elysée rolled past the funeral procession and drew\r\nup alongside him. He glanced at the people standing beside him, to his\r\nright Frank and Nicole, their children behind them, to his left Nancy\r\nHale and Père Isaac.\r\n\r\nAuguste went colder still as he saw Eli Greenglove, who had been\r\nstanding by the gate in the fence around the château, walk across the\r\nopen space, the tail of his coonskin cap bobbing. Greenglove carried a\r\nlong Kentucky rifle. Auguste had heard many a tale about Greenglove's\r\ndeadly accuracy. The Missourian took a position to one side, between\r\nRaoul and Auguste.\r\n\r\n_He won't even need to be a good shot to kill me from that distance._\r\n\r\nWords came suddenly to Auguste's mind. He spoke loudly, so everyone\r\ncould hear, and he felt good that his voice was strong. He looked Raoul\r\nin the eye as he spoke.\r\n\r\n\"I am proud to be a son of the Sauk people. But my father told me I was\r\nhis heir. It is in his will. He gave me this house and all this land.\r\nYou have no right to force me to leave.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul laughed and slapped the pistol and the knife. \"These give me the\r\nright.\" He waved a hand at the men standing in a line along the fence.\r\n\"And them.\"\r\n\r\nFrank Hopkins cleared his throat and spoke. \"Raoul, maybe there's no\r\nlaw around right here and now to make you honor Pierre's will, but there\r\nare courts in Illinois, there's a legislature, there's a governor.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul made a sound halfway between a laugh and a grunt. \"Take your\r\nhalf-breed friend to the governor. John Reynolds wants the Indians out\r\nof Illinois as bad as anybody does. He was there with the militia on\r\nRock River last June. Hell, go to the President. I'd like to see what an\r\nold Indian killer like Andy Jackson would say to you.\"\r\n\r\nAll too true, Auguste thought sadly. He had learned in New York of\r\nJackson's \"removal\" policy, aiming to drive all the red people to the\r\nwest side of the Mississippi. The work of the white chiefs was to take\r\nland from Indians, not help them keep it.\r\n\r\nPère Isaac said, \"To rob the orphan is a sin that cries out to Heaven\r\nfor vengeance. If you came to me in confession I could not give you\r\nabsolution.\"\r\n\r\n\"My conscience is clear,\" Raoul said. \"Victoire is my rightful heritage.\r\nDo you know that this Indian boy you feel so sorry for isn't even a\r\nChristian? I am, Father. A Catholic.\"\r\n\r\n\"A very bad one,\" said Père Isaac. \"I have known Auguste since he was a\r\nsmall boy. He behaves more like a Christian than you do.\"\r\n\r\nA woman's voice, Nancy Hale's, rang out over the field. \"Raoul de\r\nMarion, if you won't listen to your own priest, you'll still have to\r\nface my father. When he hears what you've done he'll preach against you\r\nand he'll stir people to make you do the right thing.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul's face changed. He looked pained.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Miss Nancy. It isn't proper for a lady like you to concern herself\r\nwith what happens to trash like this. You know well and good that your\r\nfather may have a low opinion of me, but he has an even lower opinion of\r\nIndians. He won't side with this Indian bastard.\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly Nicole rushed past Auguste.\r\n\r\n\"You're the one who's trash, Raoul!\" she cried, and ran across the\r\nintervening space and swung her hand to slap her brother. Raoul grabbed\r\nher arm and pushed her away roughly. Frank rushed to her side to hold\r\nher, his ink-stained fingers digging into her sleeves.\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't want to fight with you, Nicole,\" said Raoul with a cruel\r\ngrin. \"I believe you've got the weight advantage on me.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're a murderer and a thief, Raoul,\" she shot back. \"And the day will\r\ncome when people will have enough of you and drive you out of this\r\ncounty.\"\r\n\r\nWaves of heat and cold ran through Auguste's body, and when he clenched\r\nhis fists he felt the sweat on his palms. He had to speak out. He owed\r\nit to his father to fight, somehow, for this land. But how could he\r\ndrive away some twenty armed men?\r\n\r\nA sudden thought came to him. \"Raoul, I challenge you to fight me for\r\nthe land. With pistols or knives or barehanded. Any way you want it.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul grinned, white teeth appearing suddenly under the black mustache.\r\n\"You've gotten big in the last six years, but I'm a better shot than you\r\nare, and I'd slice you to bits with my knife. In a barehanded fight I'd\r\nbite your ears off and ram 'em down your throat. We don't need a fight\r\nto prove what anybody can plainly see.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you won't fight me you're a coward as well as a thief.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul's eyes narrowed, and his shoulders hunched forward, as if he was\r\nabout to attack.\r\n\r\n\"Dueling is also a grave sin,\" said Père Isaac. \"And it is against the\r\nlaw of this state. I forbid you to fight.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul laughed and lifted his empty hands. \"Too bad, mongrel. The father\r\nwon't let us fight.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste turned to Père Isaac. \"How can you take from me the only way I\r\nhave of fighting for this land?\"\r\n\r\n\"If God wants you to have it, He will see that you get it without doing\r\nwrong,\" said Père Isaac calmly.\r\n\r\nThe face of Black Hawk appeared in Auguste's mind, and suddenly he\r\nunderstood the wrath that had always seemed to smoulder just below the\r\nwar chief's skin. This must be how Black Hawk felt when the pale eyes\r\ntold him he could no longer come to Saukenuk. That was why Black Hawk\r\nhad been leading his people back to Saukenuk year after year. He would\r\nnot give up.\r\n\r\nAnd neither would Auguste.\r\n\r\n_I must fight. I promised my father I would fight for this land. I\r\nsmoked the calumet with him._\r\n\r\nHe remembered Pierre's words: _Now you have a chance to own land, to be\r\nrich and to have power. You can learn how to use your wealth to protect\r\nyour people._\r\n\r\nAnd he was losing that chance. As he saw these rich acres being torn\r\naway from him, more and more he felt himself wanting them.\r\n\r\nBut how to fight for the land? To charge Raoul's pistol and the rifles\r\nof his men would simply mean death. Surely that was not what Pierre\r\nwanted for him.\r\n\r\nAn unfamiliar voice said, \"Is this really how you settle land disputes\r\nin Smith County?\"\r\n\r\nAuguste turned to see David Cooper, a lean, hard-eyed man he had met\r\nseveral weeks earlier when Cooper had visited Pierre to pay his\r\nrespects.\r\n\r\nRaoul said, \"Don't you like the way we do things here, Cooper?\"\r\n\r\nCooper's cold expression did not change. \"Just requesting information,\r\nMr. de Marion. That's all.\"\r\n\r\nCooper had brought his family to Victor from some place in Indiana three\r\nyears ago, buying a choice piece of bottomland from Pierre. Auguste had\r\nlearned that he was a veteran of the War of 1812.\r\n\r\nJustus Bennett, the county land commissioner, who Auguste knew to be one\r\nof Raoul's creatures, said, \"Mr. Cooper, I've been reading law most of\r\nmy adult life, and I can assure you Mr. Raoul de Marion has as sound a\r\ncase under common law and English precedent as I've ever seen.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste doubted that anyone here knew what that meant, impressive as it\r\nmight sound.\r\n\r\n_The whites know how to twist any law to their advantage._\r\n\r\nCooper said nothing further.\r\n\r\nThese people might feel sorry for him, Auguste thought, and resent what\r\nRaoul was doing. But he'd get no help from any of the men who were\r\nstanding around behind him. Raoul and his men were armed and determined,\r\nand the rest of the people here were not ready to give up their lives to\r\nhelp a half-breed.\r\n\r\nBut Auguste had taken advantage of Raoul's distraction with Cooper and\r\nBennett to cut the distance between himself and his uncle in half. If he\r\ncould get close enough to Raoul he might have a chance to get at him\r\nwith his knife. He'd worn the deerhorn-handled knife today only because\r\nhis father had given it to him.\r\n\r\nAs he hesitated, he heard footsteps in the grass and turned to see his\r\ngrandfather walking toward Raoul with slow but firm steps, thumping his\r\nwalking stick on the ground.\r\n\r\n\"No, Grandpapa!\" Auguste called out to him.\r\n\r\n\"This is my son, I very much regret to say,\" said Elysée. \"And I must\r\nadminister correction.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste started to follow Elysée, but Raoul dropped his hand warningly\r\nto his pistol.\r\n\r\n\"Don't come any closer, half-breed.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was with Pierre when he wrote his final will,\" said Elysée. \"And I\r\nhave a copy of it. I know his mind was sound. He gave the whole\r\nestate--except for the fur company, which we have always agreed would be\r\nyours--to Auguste.\"\r\n\r\n\"You gave the fur company to me when you divided the estate between me\r\nand Pierre years ago,\" Raoul said. \"So my own good brother left me\r\nnothing. Thirty thousand acres of the best land in western Illinois go\r\nto a mongrel Indian, and you say his mind was sound? The more fool you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are un bète!\" Elysée shouted. \"You are proof that there is no just\r\nGod. If there were He would have taken you and let Pierre live.\"\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur de Marion!\" the priest cried. \"Think what you are saying. On\r\nthis day of all days.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul said, \"I've always known that you loved Pierre and not me, Papa.\"\r\n\r\n\"You make it impossible to love you!\" Elysée answered. \"Now listen to\r\nme. Victoire is my home. I built this place. Those I love are buried\r\nhere. I command you, leave at once. Get off this land.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul, a head taller than the old man, took a step toward his father.\r\n\"If you wanted it to be yours, you shouldn't have given it to Pierre.\r\nYou have nothing now, you old fool.\"\r\n\r\nElysée swung the stick at Raoul's head. The thump resounded over the\r\nfield, and Raoul staggered back, his broad-brimmed hat falling to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nRaoul bared his teeth, drew back his fist and smashed it into his\r\nfather's face. The blow knocked Elysée hard against one of the upright\r\nlogs of the gateway. He cried out and fell heavily to the ground. He lay\r\nmoaning and jerking his head from side to side in agony. The priest\r\nrushed to him, dropping to his knees.\r\n\r\nWith a scream Nicole threw herself down beside her father.\r\n\r\nA red curtain swept over Auguste's eyes, blinding him momentarily. When\r\nhe could see again he saw only the face of one man, Raoul, looking down\r\nat Elysée with triumph and contempt.\r\n\r\nKnife in hand, Auguste threw himself at Raoul.\r\n\r\nRaoul's pistol was out. His dark eyes gleamed with triumph as he pointed\r\nthe muzzle at Auguste's chest.\r\n\r\n_He was hoping I would attack him_, Auguste realized, knowing he would\r\nnever reach Raoul before the pistol went off.\r\n\r\nA sudden movement to his side caught his eye. In a glance he saw Eli\r\nGreenglove swinging a rifle butt at his head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10\r\n\r\nDispossessed\r\n\r\n\r\nAuguste woke.\r\n\r\nHe was in a room he had never seen before. A plain black cross hung high\r\non one white plaster wall. He lay on a bed with a straw-filled mattress,\r\non top of the quilt. He wasn't wearing his coat. Or his pale eyes'\r\nboots.\r\n\r\nPain throbbed in his head, and with each pulse his vision momentarily\r\nblurred.\r\n\r\nHe rolled his pounding head on the pillow and saw Nancy Hale sitting\r\nbeside him. Her long blond braids glistened in the pale light that came\r\nthrough the oiled paper window.\r\n\r\nThe way she was looking down at him startled him. The blue of her eyes\r\nburned like the blue center of a flame. Her lips seemed fuller and\r\nredder than he'd ever seen them, and they were slightly parted. This was\r\nthe way she had been looking at him while he lay unconscious, he\r\nrealized, and he had seen it only because he had awakened suddenly and\r\ntaken her by surprise.\r\n\r\n\"What happened?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"That man of your uncle's, Eli Greenglove, hit you with his rifle. Your\r\nuncle said he'd kill you next time he sees you awake. So we took you out\r\nhere to my father's parsonage.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long have I been asleep?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"A long time. Hours. I'm awfully glad to see you wake up, Auguste. I\r\ndidn't know if you ever would. Greenglove hit you hard enough to kill\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nHe remembered Elysée lying on the ground, writhing. Rage boiled up\r\ninside him again as he thought of Raoul striking Grandpapa down.\r\n\r\n\"How is my grandfather?\" He tried to sit up, and the room started to\r\nrock and pitch. The pain pounded on his head like a spiked war club.\r\nNancy put a hand on his shoulder, and he lay back against the pillow. He\r\nshut his eyes momentarily to get his equilibrium back.\r\n\r\n\"We don't know--he may have broken his hip. But try not to worry,\r\nAuguste. Nicole and Frank took him back to their house.\"\r\n\r\nThat searing gaze of a moment ago was gone, but there was still a warm\r\nlight in her eyes.\r\n\r\nHe heard a footstep on the other side of the bed. He turned, bringing\r\nback the ache in his head full force, to see the tall figure of Reverend\r\nPhilip Hale standing in the doorway of the small room. Hale, dressed in\r\na black clawhammer coat and black trousers with a white silk stock\r\nwrapped around his throat, stood with his arms folded, gazing at Auguste\r\nwith pursed lips and a deep crease between his bushy eyebrows.\r\n\r\n\"You can thank the Lord's mercy you're not hurt worse, young man. I\r\nsuppose you'll want to be on your way soon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Father!\" Nancy exclaimed. \"He just came awake. He might have a\r\nfractured skull.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I'm all right,\" Auguste said. He tried to sit up again. He\r\nmanaged it, but he felt suddenly dizzy and sick to his stomach. He put\r\nhis hand over his mouth. Nancy picked up a china chamber pot from the\r\nbedside and held it for him, but after a moment the spasm of nausea\r\npassed and, gingerly, he shook his head at her. His first afternoon at\r\nVictoire, when he had thrown up his dinner before everyone in the great\r\nhall, flickered through his memory.\r\n\r\nHe looked up and saw Hale staring at him with even deeper distaste.\r\nClear enough that the reverend didn't like to see Nancy's care for him.\r\n\r\n_Grandpapa's hurt, and I'm the only one around here with medical\r\ntraining._\r\n\r\nAuguste lifted his head again, determined to get up in spite of the\r\npain. \"I must go to my grandfather. He may die if he isn't cared for\r\nproperly.\"\r\n\r\nA spear of horror shot through him. His medicine bundle, containing his\r\nprecious stones and the bear's claw, was still at the château. All his\r\nspiritual power was collected in that bag. Whatever the risk, he must go\r\nback and get it. And he wanted the bag of surgical instruments he'd\r\nbrought back from New York.\r\n\r\n\"I'll be out of here as soon as I can stand, sir,\" he said. \"I have much\r\nto do.\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" Nancy cried. \"Auguste, you're not well enough to go anywhere. And,\r\nFather, I told you what happened at the funeral. We've got to help\r\nAuguste. If you speak, people will listen.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know the rights and wrongs of it,\" said Hale, looking\r\nirritated, presented with a problem he did not want to try to solve.\r\n\r\nAuguste said, \"My father wanted me to inherit Victoire. There are\r\nwitnesses. There are two copies of his will, if Raoul hasn't already\r\ndestroyed them.\"\r\n\r\nReverend Hale glowered at Auguste. \"What if Raoul de Marion's men come\r\nlooking for you?\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly, as when facing Raoul at the gateway to Victoire, Auguste felt\r\nterribly alone. Nancy would do anything she could for him; after seeing\r\nher loving look when he awoke he was sure of that. But there was little\r\nenough she could do. Especially because of the way her father so\r\nobviously felt about him.\r\n\r\n\"I'll be gone as quick as I can, Reverend Hale.\"\r\n\r\n\"If they come here while Auguste is here you'll have to tell them he's\r\nnot here and refuse to let them in,\" said Nancy firmly.\r\n\r\n\"Lie to them? I'm not a Jesuit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Father! Would you let Auguste be killed?\"\r\n\r\nThe word \"killed\" set a storm of frightful thoughts whirling through\r\nAuguste's head. Raoul's pistol had been pointed right at his chest. And\r\nGreenglove had tried to brain him. They wouldn't stop until they had\r\nkilled him. Only then would Raoul be secure in his possession of\r\nVictoire. Dazed and hurting though he was, Auguste had to get out of\r\nSmith County if he was to live another day.\r\n\r\nHale turned and went back to his own room, shaking his head.\r\n\r\n\"Your father is no friend to me,\" said Auguste.\r\n\r\nNancy's face was like a lake whose surface was troubled by a wind. \"He's\r\nvery strict. He didn't go to your father's funeral because it was a\r\nCatholic service. But if anything happens he'll do the right thing. You\r\ncan count on him for that.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste said nothing. But he didn't share her confidence.\r\n\r\nEarly that evening, Auguste, Nancy and Reverend Hale were sitting in\r\nthe front room of the Hales' one-story house. They had eaten a rabbit\r\nstew with potatoes, onions and beans from the Hales' garden and hominy\r\ngrits on the side that Nancy had pounded from corn. They washed it down\r\nwith fresh-squeezed apple cider.\r\n\r\n\"I allow no spiritous liquors in my home,\" said Reverend Hale.\r\n\r\nNow that it was dark Auguste wanted desperately to be off to see\r\nGrandpapa at Nicole and Frank's house. The old man had been badly hurt.\r\nHe might be dying.\r\n\r\nBy candlelight Hale read the Bible aloud to Nancy and Auguste. It was\r\nhis nightly custom, Nancy explained.\r\n\r\nAuguste heard the soft clip-clop of a horse's hooves and the creak of\r\ncarriage wheels and raised a hand to alert the others.\r\n\r\nPutting a finger to her lips, Nancy went to the door. She opened it a\r\ncrack, then pulled it wider and went out.\r\n\r\n\"Who is it?\" Hale called anxiously.\r\n\r\nHis heart pounding, Auguste was on his feet, looking for a weapon or for\r\na place to hide.\r\n\r\nNo answer came from Nancy, but a moment later she came back, one arm\r\naround another woman's shoulders, supporting her. A blue kerchief\r\ncovered the woman's head.\r\n\r\n\"Who is this?\" Hale said again.\r\n\r\n\"Bon soir, Reverend Hale. Forgive me for disturbing you.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a moment before Auguste recognized the battered, swollen face of\r\nMarchette. One of her eyes had been blackened this morning, but now\r\nthere were ugly bruises around both eyes, her whole face was swollen and\r\nher lips were cut and puffed.\r\n\r\nHeartbroken at the sight of her, Auguste rushed to the cook and took her\r\nhands in his.\r\n\r\n\"Marchette! What happened to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cried very much when you and Monsieur Elysée were hurt today,\r\nMonsieur Auguste. Armand did not like this, and he beat me. It _looks_\r\nvery bad, but he did not beat me hard, Monsieur. Whoever Armand beats\r\nhard, dies. But I resolved to do something for you. Monsieur Raoul, he\r\nhad barrels of Kaintuck whiskey carted up to the château. Many guests\r\nand servants got very drunk. After a while Armand was lying on the floor\r\nbeside the table, so then I went to fetch your things. Your trunk was\r\nunlocked, and I gathered up your clothes and books and put them in it\r\nand locked it. I had Bernadette Bosquet, the fiddler's wife, she is my\r\nfriend, help carry your trunk down to the carriage.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste felt as if a sudden bright light had flooded his room. His\r\nmedicine bundle had been in the trunk. And his surgical instruments.\r\nThey were safe.\r\n\r\nHe jumped up from the table. A throb of pain went through his head, and\r\nhe felt dizzy and had to cling to the table for support. Marchette's\r\neyes widened in alarm, and she put her hands out to him.\r\n\r\nRecovered after a moment--and feeling much better now than he had a few\r\nhours ago--he took Marchette's hands in his.\r\n\r\n\"I can't tell you how much this means to me, Marchette. There were\r\nthings in my trunk--sacred things--very important to me. Very precious.\r\nI thank you a thousand times.\"\r\n\r\nHer swollen lips parted in a half smile. She reached into a pocket in\r\nher apron and brought out a large pocket watch gleaming a dull gold.\r\nThen she took out a familiar oval silver case with a velvet ribbon.\r\n\r\n\"These were your father's, monsieur. I believe he would wish that you\r\nhave them.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste opened the case and saw the round lenses for only a moment as\r\nhis eyes blurred. He put his hand over his face and held it there until\r\nhe no longer felt like weeping. Then he looked at the engraving on the\r\nwatch--\"Pierre Louis Auguste de Marion, A.D. 1800\"--and his eyes filled\r\nup with tears. This, he thought, should go into his medicine bundle with\r\nthe other sacred objects.\r\n\r\n\"Where were Raoul and Greenglove when you took my trunk and things in\r\nthe carriage?\"\r\n\r\n\"Before Armand got drunk, Monsieur Raoul made him look through Monsieur\r\nElysée's room for the paper that says you are to inherit the estate.\r\nArmand found it and gave it to your uncle, and he threw it into the fire\r\nwhile Armand and Eli Greenglove watched and laughed. Then Monsieur\r\nRaoul, he got into a most furious argument with Eli Greenglove about\r\nGreenglove's daughter. They nearly fight, but I think they are afraid of\r\neach other. They are both great killers. So finally they went down to\r\ntown. Monsieur Raoul agreed to bring his woman, Greenglove's daughter,\r\nand the two boys to the château.\"\r\n\r\n\"Disgraceful!\" snorted Reverend Hale. \"Publicly living in sin.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder why he didn't bring them to the funeral?\" Nancy said.\r\n\r\nAuguste thought he knew why. Clarissa Greenglove had been a pretty,\r\nfull-bosomed girl when he first arrived at Victoire. But in the years\r\nduring which she had borne two boys to Raoul, she had turned into a\r\nlank-haired, snuff-sniffing slattern. Years ago Raoul had said he was\r\ngoing to marry Clarissa, but he never had. And Auguste had seen Raoul\r\nbending a hungry look on Nancy throughout the funeral mass this morning.\r\nThe thought of Raoul laying even a hand on Nancy angered him. It would\r\nanger Eli Greenglove, too, for a different reason.\r\n\r\nEli Greenglove, it was said, could shoot the wings off a fly one at a\r\ntime at fifty yards and was wanted in Missouri for over a dozen murders.\r\nHe might take orders from Raoul, but it would not do for Raoul to offend\r\nsuch a man. So if Eli persisted, Raoul probably would take Clarissa into\r\nthe château.\r\n\r\nAuguste felt a sinking in his stomach as he touched his fingers lightly\r\nto his throbbing head. He was alive now only because Greenglove had\r\nchosen to hit him instead of shooting him down--or instead of letting\r\nRaoul have that pleasure.\r\n\r\n\"Will you stay the night, Marchette?\" Nancy asked.\r\n\r\n\"No, I must go back to the château before Armand wakes up. Otherwise he\r\nwill beat me worse.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm going with you,\" said Auguste.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Nancy. \"They'll kill you.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste looked across the table at Nancy, staring at him with round blue\r\neyes full of the yearning, now mixed with fear, that he'd seen in them\r\nearlier. \"Pale eyes,\" the Sauk term for her people, did no justice to\r\nher eyes, the color of the turquoise stone he kept in his medicine bag.\r\nHer blond hair made his blood race. His fingertips tingled with the\r\ndesire to touch the white skin of her cheek.\r\n\r\nThough Nancy's very differentness made him desire her, he knew that he\r\nand she could never belong to each other as completely as he and Redbird\r\ndid. He could have a deep and lasting union with Redbird, a union that\r\nwould make him feel whole.\r\n\r\nBut it had been six years since he had seen Redbird, and no woman of the\r\nSauk would go without a man for that long.\r\n\r\n_My mother did_, he reminded himself.\r\n\r\nBut Redbird had probably given in to Wolf Paw and married him. After\r\nall, she hadn't had a word from White Bear in all that time.\r\n\r\nMarchette's urgent tone refocused his thoughts. \"Monsieur Raoul, he\r\nstood up on the table and held up a bag full of Spanish dollars--he\r\nsaid there were fifty--and said he would give it to the man who shoots\r\nyou. And there were many men who cheered at that and boasted they would\r\nbe the one to win the silver.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste pictured men scattering out all over Smith County, hunting for\r\nhim. He could almost feel the rifle ball shattering his skull.\r\n\r\n\"I can't hide in your house forever, Nancy. Sooner or later they'll come\r\nlooking for me, and I don't want to bring that down on your heads.\"\r\n\r\nReverend Hale said nothing, but Auguste saw relief in his square\r\nface--and grudging respect. But Hale's respect, he thought, would do him\r\nlittle good when he lay dead on the prairie.\r\n\r\nNancy's full lips quivered as she said, \"You'll go to the château and\r\nlet them shoot you?\"\r\n\r\nAuguste realized that his hands were cold with fear, and he rubbed them\r\ntogether to warm them. Hale's house was about ten miles across the\r\nprairie from the Mississippi. Could he cover all that distance without\r\nbeing seen and shot?\r\n\r\n\"I'm not going to the château. I'll just see that Marchette gets there\r\nsafely. Traveling at night, she should have someone go back with her.\r\nThen I'll go on to town. To Nicole and Frank's house. To Grandpapa. I\r\nmust see him.\" He turned toward the cook and felt a stabbing in his gut\r\nat the sight of her bruised face. She'd suffered that out of love for\r\nhis father, he thought, and for his sake too.\r\n\r\n\"If you're seen you'll be shot,\" said Hale.\r\n\r\n_Don't you think I know that?_ he wanted to scream at the minister. What\r\nchoice did he have? He was like a rabbit surrounded by wolves. He forced\r\ncalm on himself and spoke with sarcasm.\r\n\r\n\"Surely you know, Reverend, that Indians are good at getting about\r\nunnoticed.\"\r\n\r\nHe felt his fear turning to a rising excitement as he recalled the\r\nlessons of stealth and cunning he'd learned as a child of the Sauk.\r\n\r\n\"But what will you do then?\" Nancy asked. \"How will you get back here?\"\r\n\r\nAuguste hesitated. Remembering that he was a Sauk had moved his thoughts\r\nin a new direction.\r\n\r\n_I have been dispossessed. Just as my people have been dispossessed._\r\n\r\nNancy was waiting for him to speak.\r\n\r\n\"Raoul told me to go back to the woods with the other Indians. Even\r\nthough the advice came from him, I think that is just what I should do.\"\r\n\r\nNancy gasped as if he had struck her. There was silence in the cottage\r\nfor a moment.\r\n\r\n\"How will you get back to your people?\" she said. \"How will you find\r\nthem?\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled, trying to get her to smile back at him. \"I know exactly where\r\nthey are. They've crossed the Mississippi to their hunting grounds in\r\nthe Ioway Territory. I spent the first fifteen winters of my life there\r\nwith the British Band.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste remembered his dream of becoming a shaman. It had come back to\r\nlife a bit with his effort to heal Pierre. Among the pale eyes there was\r\nno room for magic. But now he felt he could go back to his own people\r\nand find magic again.\r\n\r\nHale said, \"An unwise decision, it seems to me. You've been educated.\r\nYou've had an opportunity to learn about white Christian civilization.\r\nYour uncle can't take that away from you, and you should not throw it\r\naway.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste said, \"Reverend, you know what I'm leaving behind. But you don't\r\nknow what I'm going back to.\"\r\n\r\nNancy started speaking rapidly, as if she was trying to hold back tears.\r\n\"Well, what about these things of yours that Marchette brought here?\r\nThere's no way you can carry a trunk on foot even as far as Nicole and\r\nFrank's house. Would you like us to keep your things here for you?\r\nPerhaps someday, after you've settled with your tribe\"--she swallowed\r\nhard--\"you could send for them.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste heard the anguish in her voice but decided to take her words at\r\nonly face value. \"Yes, I'd be truly grateful if you'd keep them for me.\r\nThe only thing I want to take now is my medicine bundle.\"\r\n\r\nReverend Hale pursed his lips and snorted, but Auguste ignored him.\r\n\r\nAuguste thought a moment. \"And I can use the surgical instruments. And\r\nat least one book.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let it be a Bible,\" said Hale. Auguste made no answer to that.\r\n\r\nAs Eli Greenglove struck him down, Auguste remembered, he had been\r\ncharging at Raoul with his knife in his hand.\r\n\r\n\"What happened to my knife?\"\r\n\r\n\"I picked it up,\" said Nancy in a clipped tone. She stood up and went\r\nover to an elaborately carved oak sideboard, a handsome piece of\r\nfurniture that seemed out of place in this simple cabin, and took\r\nAuguste's knife out of a drawer. She handed it to him and he slipped it\r\ninto the leather sheath at his belt.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Nancy. My father gave that to me a long time ago.\" Their\r\neyes met, and he felt a warmth spread through him. It was going to be\r\nhard to leave her.\r\n\r\nNancy remained standing. \"Let's go out to the wagon and see what\r\nMarchette has brought. I can help you carry your trunk in.\"\r\n\r\nMarchette and Reverend Hale both said at the same time, \"I can do that!\"\r\nThe coincidence made everyone laugh nervously.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Nancy firmly. \"Marchette, you're hurt and tired. Father, why\r\ndon't you see what consolation you can offer this poor, mistreated\r\nwoman. Auguste's trunk can't be that heavy. Come on, Auguste.\"\r\n\r\nBefore either Hale or Marchette could answer, Nancy had Auguste out the\r\ndoor. He glanced back into the room just before the door closed and saw\r\nHale's fists clenched on either side of his open Bible.\r\n\r\nAuguste stood for a moment, letting his eyes adjust from the lamplight\r\ninside to the darkness out here. A fat moon hung overhead; he judged it\r\nwould be full in two nights. With this much light he'd be in even more\r\ndanger tonight. The white-painted steeple of Reverend Hale's little\r\nchurch, next to the cottage where he and Nancy lived, gleamed in the\r\nmoonlight.\r\n\r\nBeside him in the dark Nancy whispered fiercely, \"I don't _want_ you to\r\ngo.\"\r\n\r\nSadly he said, \"I know.\" He took her hand and squeezed it. Perhaps it\r\nwas a mistake to do that, but he could not stop himself.\r\n\r\n\"Come away from the house,\" she said.\r\n\r\nNow he could see the wagon Marchette had come in, the horse tied to a\r\nfence post beside the Hales' garden on the south side of the house. The\r\nhorse shifted from foot to foot and burbled its breath out through its\r\nlips.\r\n\r\nHolding tight to his hand, Nancy led him around to the rear of the\r\nhouse, beyond which rows of corn stood, their tassels silvery in the\r\nmoonlight.\r\n\r\n\"You and your father grow all this corn?\" Auguste asked.\r\n\r\n\"It's our land, but a neighbor does the work. He sells it in Victor and\r\nwe share the proceeds.\" She led him into the corn, brushing past the\r\ncrackling leaves. The concealment of the leaves and stalks made him feel\r\ncloser to her than ever. He wanted to reach out to her.\r\n\r\nBut the corn evoked another feeling, as well.\r\n\r\n_She can't know it, but this field reminds me of the corn bottoms around\r\nSaukenuk. It makes me want to go back all the more._\r\n\r\nWhen there were leafy stalks all around them, hiding them from the\r\nhouse, she turned to him again and said, \"Please, Auguste, I don't want\r\nyou to go away for good.\" Her eyes were bright in the moonlight.\r\n\r\nHer nearness was thrilling. He wanted to forget the worries that made\r\nhim hesitate, and take her in his arms.\r\n\r\n\"You don't want me to stay here and risk getting killed,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"You could go to Vandalia,\" she said. \"Tell Governor Reynolds what\r\nhappened. If he can't do anything for you himself, maybe he can help you\r\nfind a lawyer who will fight Raoul for you in the courts.\"\r\n\r\nHow innocent she was, he thought bitterly. \"It was Governor Reynolds who\r\ncalled out the militia to drive my people from Saukenuk. It's just as\r\nRaoul said, he would be the last man to want to help an Indian fight for\r\nland with a white man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your father sent you to school in the East because he wanted a\r\ndifferent future for you than just spending your life hunting and living\r\nin a wigwam. You'll be throwing all that away.\"\r\n\r\nHe felt a flash of anger at her. She did not understand the Sauk way of\r\nlife at all. She was just repeating what her father had said.\r\n\r\nHe remembered the way Nancy's eyes had shone each time they met on the\r\nprairie last summer. He had known then that if he spoke to Nancy of\r\nmarriage, she would want it no matter how much it enraged her father.\r\nBut marriage with Nancy would be a coming together of two strangers, of\r\npeople whose worlds were utterly different. In the past six years he had\r\nlearned much about her world, but that did not mean he belonged in it.\r\nAnd she knew next to nothing of his.\r\n\r\nIt hurt to hold himself back; he felt powerfully drawn to her. But what\r\nhe was feeling was impossible. Impossible to fulfill.\r\n\r\n\"I can use my schooling to help my people make a better life for\r\nthemselves. The gift my father gave me is a gift I will give to the\r\nSauk. And it may be worth more than the land Raoul has stolen from me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't want to lose you,\" she sobbed. She threw herself against him\r\nand wrapped her arms around him. Her tear-wet cheek pressed against his.\r\nHer face was hot, as though she had a fever. She wanted him; he felt it\r\nnow, just as he had seen it hours ago in her unguarded eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I've never cared for a man as I care for you, Auguste,\" she said.\r\n\"Everything you say may be true, but if you go back to your tribe I'll\r\nnever see you again.\"\r\n\r\nIt hurt Auguste to admit it, but it was almost certain that they would\r\nnever meet again.\r\n\r\n\"If you want to--you could come with me.\" Even as he spoke, he was sure\r\nit would never work. Did she not dismiss the way of the Sauk as \"hunting\r\nand living in a wigwam\"?\r\n\r\nAnd suppose Redbird _had_ waited for him? What would he do with Nancy\r\nthen?\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she said. \"If I went with you my father would hunt us down and\r\nRaoul would help him. And besides--\" She hesitated.\r\n\r\n\"What else?\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. \"I'm too afraid. Indians frighten me. Not you. Real\r\nIndians.\"\r\n\r\n_Real Indians?_\r\n\r\nAnger pulsed in his head. He wanted to pull away from her then, but she\r\nwouldn't let him go. Her arms tightened around him, and her body moved\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\n\"Auguste, do you know where it says in the Bible, 'Adam knew Eve, his\r\nwife'? I want to know you--that way.\"\r\n\r\nHer soft words thrilled him, and he forgot his anger. He felt exalted,\r\nand he held her tightly. He had wanted Nancy ever since he met her last\r\nJune. All summer long, desiring her, he had fought his desire.\r\n\r\nHe pressed his mouth on hers, crushing her soft, full lips. She was\r\npulling at him now, pulling him down. Pulling him to lie with her\r\nbetween the rows of corn.\r\n\r\n_I must not do this._\r\n\r\nAbruptly he steadied his feet and drew his face away from hers.\r\n\r\nThe vague shape of a future different from the one he planned shimmered\r\nin his mind. They could have each other here and now, and he could give\r\nup his decision to return to the Sauk. He might flee temporarily to some\r\nnearby county, find work, study until he could begin practicing\r\nmedicine, marry Nancy, perhaps even try to win back the estate in the\r\npale eyes' courts.\r\n\r\nHe would become, more or less, a pale eyes. It would be the end of him\r\nas a Sauk.\r\n\r\nAnd the White Bear arose in his mind, as clearly as if he had suddenly\r\nstood up here among the corn stalks.\r\n\r\nThe White Bear said, _Your people need you_.\r\n\r\n\"Auguste, please, _please_,\" Nancy whispered. \"It isn't wrong. It's\r\nright for us. There's no other man but you who's right for me. I don't\r\nwant to end up a dried-up old spinster who never knew the man she truly\r\nloved.\"\r\n\r\nShe slid down the length of him, falling to her knees in the furrow. She\r\npressed her cheek against the hard bulge in his trousers, sending a\r\nthrill through his whole body.\r\n\r\n\"Please.\"\r\n\r\nHe wanted to let himself sink to the ground with her. He shut his eyes\r\nand saw the White Bear more vividly in his mind. It seemed to glow.\r\n\r\nHe held himself rigid, fighting the pressure inside him that made him\r\nwant to give in to her. He told himself he could give Nancy this moment\r\nof love she wanted and still go back to the Sauk. If he did not take her\r\nnow as she wanted to be taken, he would regret it bitterly later.\r\n\r\nBut if he did this with her it would tie them in a bond that would be\r\nwrong to break. If he gave her what she wanted and then left, it would\r\nhurt her, might even kill her.\r\n\r\nHe took a step backward, then another. His legs felt as if they were\r\nmade of wood; he could barely move them.\r\n\r\nNancy let him go, put her hands to her face and sobbed, kneeling between\r\nthe rows of corn.\r\n\r\nHe stood there a moment, feeling helpless. Then he went to her, took her\r\narms and helped her to stand up.\r\n\r\n\"I do love you, Nancy,\" he said. \"But if I knew you as Adam knew Eve, I\r\nwould still have to leave you. And it would hurt both of us much more.\"\r\n\r\nSobs still shook her body. He did not even know if she heard him. But\r\nshe let him lead her out of the cornfield, around the locked and silent\r\nchurch, and back to the wagon where his trunk lay. As they walked she\r\npulled a handkerchief out of her sleeve, wiped her face and blew her\r\nnose.\r\n\r\nHis heart felt heavy as lead. Sure as he was that this was the right\r\nthing to do, he was almost as sure it was wrong.\r\n\r\nWhen they got to the wagon, he was still holding her arm. Gently she\r\npulled free of him.\r\n\r\n\"You're a good man, Auguste. I'm afraid I'll always love you. Whether\r\nyou want me to or not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you all right?\" he asked. He wanted to make her happy, and he felt\r\nterribly helpless.\r\n\r\n\"I will be,\" she said.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs he rode in the wagon back to the château with Marchette, the back of\r\nAuguste's neck tingled. He pictured silent hunters crouched out in the\r\nprairie, their Kentucky long rifles ready, their thoughts fixed on fifty\r\npieces of silver. His eyes moved restlessly over the low hills around\r\nthem. The nearly full moon was sinking before them in the west, a\r\nlantern at the end of their trail. In some places the prairie grass\r\nclosed in around the horse and wagon, high as the horse's rump and the\r\nwagon's wheels, and it looked to Auguste as if they were pushing their\r\nway through a moonlit lake.\r\n\r\nThe loudest sound he heard was the steady singing of choruses of\r\ncrickets more numerous than all the tribes of man. Somehow it seemed\r\nthey always sang louder this time of year, as if they knew that frost\r\nand snow were coming soon to silence their song.\r\n\r\nThe château's peaked roof rose black against the stars. Before they\r\nreached the orchards, Auguste put his arm around Marchette and gave her\r\na kiss on the cheek. Jumping down from the wagon, he tied to his\r\nshoulders with rawhide thongs the pack that held his medicine bundle,\r\nhis instruments and his book.\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye and thank you, Marchette,\" he whispered, and darted off into\r\nthe tall grass.\r\n\r\n\"God keep His eye upon you,\" she called softly after him.\r\n\r\nWatching for Raoul's lurking hunters, he was soon past the château and\r\nslipping along the edge of the road that led through the hills to town.\r\n\r\nHe froze. He saw a light ahead of him, a swinging lantern moving away\r\nfrom him. Loud voices carried to him on the still night air.\r\n\r\nThose must be some of Raoul's men. He was frightened, but he needed to\r\nknow what Raoul was doing. Staying well in the shadows of the trees that\r\ngrew along the edge of the road, he moved quickly and silently until he\r\nwas close enough to make out words.\r\n\r\nThey staggered along, praising Raoul's generosity with Old Kaintuck.\r\nAuguste saw three of them in the lantern's yellow glow, each carrying a\r\nrifle.\r\n\r\nHe bit his lower lip, and fear formed a cold hollow in his chest. If\r\nthese men saw him they would shoot him on the spot.\r\n\r\nOr try to. He doubted they could hit anything, drunk as they looked.\r\nWith that thought, his tense muscles eased a little.\r\n\r\nThe men crossed a narrow ridge that connected a hill with the bluff on\r\nwhich the trading post stood. Auguste flinched, startled by a whoop and\r\na wail, followed by the crash of a body falling through shrubbery and a\r\nheavy clattering--probably a rifle--against rocks.\r\n\r\nFrom the ridge came a burst of drunken laughter. Two of the men mocked\r\ntheir comrade who had rolled to the bottom of the hill. They wouldn't\r\nhelp him climb back up. Sleep it off down there, they told him. Curses\r\nfloated faintly from below, then there was silence.\r\n\r\n\"What if that Indian is lurking around here?\" said the man carrying the\r\nlantern. \"He might come upon Hodge in the dark and scalp him or\r\nsomething.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste thought, _How I would love to_. He recognized the Prussian\r\naccent of the man speaking. It was Otto Wegner, one of the men who\r\nworked at Raoul's trading post.\r\n\r\nThe other man said, \"Hell, if the Injun ain't dead from the way Eli\r\nconked him with that rifle butt, he's halfway to Canada. He knows he'll\r\nget his red hide full of holes if he stays around Smith County.\"\r\n\r\n\"As for me, I do not shoot unarmed Indians,\" said Wegner. \"Fifty Spanish\r\ndollars or not. I have my pride. I served under von Blücher at\r\nWaterloo.\"\r\n\r\n\"Waterloo, hah? Well, ain't you a hell of a fella! Raoul'd skin you\r\nalive and wear you for a hat if he heard you talking like that.\"\r\n\r\n\"He would not. I am his best rifleman--after Eli Greenglove. He knows\r\nmy value. And my honor as a soldier is worth more to me than fifty\r\npieces of eight.\"\r\n\r\nCrouching in the shrubbery, Auguste shook his head in wonder. There was\r\nsome sense of right and wrong even among Raoul's rogues.\r\n\r\nBut that hadn't stopped Wegner from being one of the men who backed\r\nRaoul with his rifle this morning.\r\n\r\nHe waited for the men to cross the ridge. He heard no sound from the one\r\nwho had fallen; he had probably taken his comrades' advice and gone to\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nWhen the lantern swung out of sight around a corner of the trading post\r\npalisade, Auguste darted forward. Keeping low, he made a wide circle\r\nthrough the wooded slope above Victor. He scrambled down to the road\r\nwhere the Hopkins house stood. A long-eared black dog barked and ran at\r\nhim when he passed one of the houses along the road. His heart stopped\r\nas he waited for doors to fly open and rifles to fire at him. But he\r\nkept walking, and the dog stopped barking when he was beyond the house\r\nit was guarding.\r\n\r\nHoping none of the neighbors would hear him, he knocked loudly at the\r\nHopkins door to wake them up.\r\n\r\nFrank Hopkins, holding a candle in his hand, stood in the doorway in a\r\nlong nightshirt. \"What the devil is it? We've got a sick man in here--\"\r\nHe peered closer. \"My God, Auguste! Get inside, quick.\"\r\n\r\nHe reached out, dragged Auguste through the door and shut it quickly\r\nbehind him.\r\n\r\n\"I thought you were out at the Hales'.\" They stood in Frank's\r\nground-floor workshop. The iron printing press towered shadowy in the\r\ncandle's glow.\r\n\r\n\"I came to see Grandpapa. And--Frank, I'm going back to my people. I\r\nneed your help.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come upstairs.\" Frank helped Auguste untie his backpack.\r\n\r\nThe stairs led to a second-floor corridor, and Frank drew Auguste into a\r\nroom where an oil lamp with a tall glass chimney burned next to a large\r\nbed. Nicole sat there. The lamplight revealed Elysée's sharp profile\r\nagainst the white of the pillow.\r\n\r\nNicole jumped to her feet. \"Oh, Auguste! Are you all right?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm getting better. How is Grandpapa?\"\r\n\r\n\"He's only been awake half the time. Gram Medill looked in on him. She\r\nsaid he wrenched his hip when he fell and had bad bruises, but he hadn't\r\nbroken any bones. I've been sitting up with him. What about you--how is\r\nyour head?\"\r\n\r\nAuguste felt as if chains had fallen away from his chest at the news\r\nthat Grandpapa was not dying. Then his head started to hurt. In the\r\nexcitement of slipping past his enemies, Auguste had forgotten his pain.\r\nNow he rubbed the spot above his right ear where Greenglove's rifle had\r\nhit him. He felt a lump that was sore to the touch. But he was able to\r\nsmile reassuringly at Nicole.\r\n\r\nHe spoke in a low voice so as not to disturb Elysée. \"I won't be able to\r\nput my fine beaver hat on over this bump. But I won't be taking my fine\r\nbeaver hat where I'm going.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll get some more chairs,\" Frank said. \"We can talk in here. The old\r\ngentleman is sound asleep now. Could you use a drop of brandy, Auguste?\"\r\n\r\nAuguste nodded. \"That might ease the pain.\" He thought not only of the\r\npain from the rifle blow, but of the pain in his heart from having lost\r\nVictoire despite his promise to his father. And the pain of tearing\r\nhimself away from Nancy.\r\n\r\nHe and Frank quietly removed chairs from the other upstairs rooms where\r\nthe Hopkins children were sleeping. Frank went down to the kitchen and\r\ncame back with a tray bearing three small bowl-shaped crystal glasses\r\nand a cut-glass decanter that twinkled in the lamplight.\r\n\r\n\"Handsome glassware,\" Auguste said, seating himself and carefully\r\nsetting his backpack between his feet.\r\n\r\n\"From the time of Louis the Fifteenth,\" Nicole said. \"One of the things\r\nPapa brought over from the old château in France. And he gave it to\r\nFrank and me as a wedding present. At least Raoul won't get his hands on\r\nthis.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste said, \"But Raoul has everything else, because father left it all\r\nto me. I told him he should will it to you; I should have insisted.\" His\r\nface burned with shame.\r\n\r\nFrank said, \"I doubt we'd have held onto the estate any longer than you\r\ndid. And, frankly, I don't want it any more than you do. I don't know\r\nhow Nicole feels.\"\r\n\r\nNow that the land was irrevocably lost to him, Auguste was no longer so\r\nsure that he did not want it. He twisted in his chair, angry at himself\r\nfor his uncertainty.\r\n\r\nNicole shook her head. \"I'm a wife and mother. I'm not prepared to be a\r\nchâtelaine. Especially when I'd have to fight that--that beast.\"\r\n\r\nAs Frank poured an inch of the warm amber liquid into each of their\r\nglasses, Auguste noticed that his fingers were, as always, blackened. He\r\nmust never get the stains of his trade off his hands.\r\n\r\nFrank said, \"I'm going to write in the _Visitor_ about what happened\r\ntoday, tell what I saw, so the whole county will know what happened.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste looked at Nicole. He saw fear in her eyes, but she said nothing.\r\n\r\n\"Why write about it?\" Auguste said. \"Raoul would do some harm to you.\r\nAnd it would change nothing. I won't even be here to read it.\" The last\r\nthing he wanted was these people, whom he cared about, getting into\r\ntrouble because of him.\r\n\r\nFrank smiled faintly. \"You know that unlike just about every other man\r\nin Smith County, I don't carry a gun.\" He pointed downward, in the\r\ndirection of the press on the floor below them. \"That's my way of\r\nfighting.\"\r\n\r\nFor a moment Auguste felt ashamed that he was running away from that\r\nsame fight.\r\n\r\n\"Because you stood by me today my heart will always sing your praises.\r\nDo you think my father's spirit will be sad if I do not stay and fight\r\nfor the land until I die?\"\r\n\r\n\"You almost did die, Auguste,\" Nicole said.\r\n\r\n_And I might yet, before I get away from here._\r\n\r\nHe sipped the brandy. It burned his tongue and his throat and lit a fire\r\nin his belly. It made him feel stronger.\r\n\r\nFrank said, \"Nobody's saying you should stay. I don't want to see you\r\nkilled.\"\r\n\r\nNicole said, \"Neither would your father. Pierre wanted you to have the\r\nestate, but he didn't want you dead on account of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Amen to that,\" said Frank.\r\n\r\n_Yes_, Auguste thought, despising himself, _but I think he expected me\r\nto keep the land for more than a day_.\r\n\r\nFrank went on, \"But if you go back to your people, you've got to tell\r\nthem--they can no more fight the United States for their land than you\r\ncould fight Raoul.\"\r\n\r\nA fierce heat rose in Auguste as he took another sip of brandy. \"At St.\r\nGeorge's School I read that the Indian does not make good use of the\r\nland. The whites need the land. Therefore the Indian must yield.\" He\r\nclenched his fist around the glass in his hand. \"We were living on this\r\nland! Doesn't that mean anything?\"\r\n\r\nFrank said, \"Auguste, you know better than any of your people how much\r\npower the United States have. You've got to tell them.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste was silent for a moment.\r\n\r\n_The long knives_, he thought. That was what his people called the\r\nAmerican soldiers. But the British Band had no idea how very many long\r\nknives there were. He must make Black Hawk understand.\r\n\r\nHe sipped a little more of the brandy, and its fire flowed through his\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nHe sighed and nodded. \"I will tell them. Frank, I need a boat.\"\r\n\r\nNicole said, \"Your eyelids are drooping, Auguste. You're tired and\r\nyou're still hurt. You can't go tonight.\"\r\n\r\nTrue. And he wanted to stay long enough to see Grandpapa when he was\r\nawake.\r\n\r\nAuguste's last memory that night was of letting Frank lead him across\r\nthe corridor into a darkened bedroom, where he fell face down on an\r\nempty bed.\r\n\r\nWhen he came to himself again, he was lying on the same bed, still fully\r\nclothed except for his boots. The room was not as dark as he remembered;\r\nit was in a sort of twilight. The one window was shuttered. A curtain\r\ncovered the doorway. He looked around the room, saw boys' clothing\r\nhanging on pegs and piled on the floor, another bed, covered with\r\nrumpled sheets, empty. His own boots and his pack were set neatly at the\r\nfoot of his bed.\r\n\r\nAn urgent pressure inside told him he had been sleeping a long time. He\r\nsaw a chamber pot in one corner. Smart of them to leave the pot here, he\r\nthought as he filled it. He didn't dare to go to their outhouse during\r\ndaylight.\r\n\r\nHe went to the window and cautiously looked through the shutter. The\r\nwindow looked south, and he could not see the sun, only the black\r\nshadows it painted in the ruts of the road that slanted up the hill past\r\nthe Hopkins house. It must be late afternoon.\r\n\r\nHe wondered, were Raoul and his men out there somewhere, looking for\r\nhim? Would he live to see another nightfall?\r\n\r\nHis head ached less than it had last night--until he touched it. Then\r\nthe pain was like someone pounding a nail into his brain. The bump felt\r\nas big as a hen's egg.\r\n\r\nOpening his backpack, he took out his leather medicine bag and drew out\r\nthe stones one by one, rubbing his fingers over each. He opened his\r\nshirt and touched the tip of the bear's claw to the five scars on his\r\nchest.\r\n\r\nThen, on impulse, he touched it to the old scar on his cheek.\r\n\r\nA black leather bag contained his surgical instruments--two saws, a big\r\none for legs and a smaller one for arms; four scalpels; lancets for\r\nbleeding; a turnkey for pulling teeth; a probe and tongs for removing\r\nbullets; a small jar of opium. Any of those things might be needed,\r\nwhere he was going.\r\n\r\nLast, he took out a book, chosen almost at random from his small\r\ncollection. On the spine of its brown leather cover was stamped in gold:\r\n\"J. Milton. _Paradise Lost_.\"\r\n\r\nReverend Hale had recommended that he take a Bible. This long poem\r\ngiving the Christian account of creation was the next thing to a Bible.\r\nBut he had read it at St. George's and enjoyed it. And its title and its\r\nstory of Adam and Eve being driven out of the Garden of Eden made him\r\nthink of how he was dispossessed. Perhaps he would find some wisdom or\r\nguidance in the book.\r\n\r\nToday he thought, _Paradise lost? It may be that I'm returning to\r\nparadise._\r\n\r\nBut then he remembered how Nancy had wanted to \"know\" him as Adam knew\r\nEve. He _was_ leaving behind what might have been a great happiness.\r\n\r\nHe opened the book and read the first verse his eye fell upon:\r\n\r\n    High on a Throne of Royal State, which far\r\n    Outshone the wealth of _Ormus_ and of _Ind_,\r\n    Or where the gorgeous East with richest hand\r\n    Show'rs on her Kings _Barbaric_ Pearl and Gold,\r\n    Satan exalted sat ...\r\n\r\nSounded like Raoul, with his fifty Spanish dollars and his steamboat and\r\nlead mine and trading post. Raoul was better fitted to be Satan than to\r\nbe the angel at the gates of Eden keeping sinners away.\r\n\r\nHe heard voices nearby. One, faint but unmistakable, was Grandpapa's.\r\nHis heart leaped. He quickly repacked his treasures.\r\n\r\nHe pushed the curtain aside and hurried across the hall. It was a joy to\r\nsee Elysée's eyes looking at him, open and bright.\r\n\r\n\"I do not as a rule believe in miracles,\" Elysée said, smiling at\r\nAuguste, \"but it's certainly a miracle that you could charge a man\r\npointing a pistol at your chest and come out with nothing but a bump on\r\nyour head.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a bad enough bump, Grandpapa,\" said Auguste, dragging over the\r\nchair he had sat in last night and pulling it close to the side of the\r\nbed. \"I wish I could stay and doctor you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our local midwife says I too will heal,\" said Elysée. \"I can move all\r\nmy arms and legs without extreme pain. I think the worst injury was to\r\nmy hip.\" He touched his right side gently. \"I bruised it when I fell.\r\nThere's swelling there, but I can move my leg. The hip is not broken.\"\r\nHe closed his eyes, and Auguste knew that the old man was feeling a\r\nsharper pain in his heart than in his bones. \"You must not think of\r\nstaying here. I am afraid Raoul is perfectly capable of murdering you.\"\r\n\r\n_One son dead, the other an enemy. And now I must leave him. How much\r\nmore can he stand?_\r\n\r\nNicole was sitting beside Elysée's bed, just as she had been last night\r\nwhen Auguste arrived. He wondered whether she had slept.\r\n\r\nNicole smiled at him. \"I sent the children down to play by the river.\r\nHaving two injured adults to care for has been very restful for me.\"\r\n\r\nElysée sat up a little straighter, Nicole quickly plumping the pillows\r\nbehind him, and turned a sharp, blue-eyed stare at Auguste.\r\n\r\n\"Nicole and Frank told me about your plan to go back to the Sauk. I can\r\nunderstand why you would wish to do so, but that is not the only choice\r\nopen to you. You might consider going where people are much more\r\ncivilized than they are around here--back East, where you were educated.\r\nEmilie and Charles would be happy, I am sure, to take you in again for a\r\ntime. And I could help you. I have money banked with Irving and Sons on\r\nWall Street. You could continue your education and follow the medical\r\nprofession in New York.\"\r\n\r\nWishing he did not have to refuse the old man, Auguste said, \"Grandpapa,\r\nI must go to the only other people I love in the world as much as I love\r\nyou and Aunt Nicole.\"\r\n\r\nElysée uttered a little sigh. \"I understand. Loyalty pulls you back to\r\nyour mother's people. It is a family trait. I suppose your father must\r\nhave told you about the mystery around the origin of our family name.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Grandpapa.\" Wanting him to know his French forebears, Pierre had\r\nspent hours with Auguste recounting their names and deeds. And he had\r\ntold him that, strangely, the de Marion records extended back only to\r\nthe late thirteenth century, though the family was wealthy and powerful\r\neven then. According to a murky legend, one ancestor had committed\r\ntreason against the King, and that one's son had deserted his wife and\r\nchildren, simply disappeared. Feeling the original name, whatever it had\r\nbeen, irreparably tarnished, the first recorded Count de Marion had\r\ndestroyed all record of it--apparently with the approval and help of the\r\nroyal authorities--and had taken his mother's family's name instead. The\r\nstory had left Auguste wishing he could use his shaman's powers to learn\r\nmore, but he doubted that the Sauk spirits could see clear across the\r\nocean.\r\n\r\nElysée said, \"We de Marions sometimes display an overabundance of\r\nloyalty, as if we were still trying to expiate that ancient guilt.\"\r\n\r\nPuzzled, Auguste said, \"There's nothing wrong with loyalty, is there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not. But remember this--if I had let loyalty keep me in\r\nFrance, we would not be here in this primeval paradise.\"\r\n\r\n_He sees this land as a paradise too. But it has not been kind to him._\r\n\r\n\"Looking back, Grandpapa, do you think you would have done better to\r\nhave stayed in France?\"\r\n\r\nElysée laughed, a short, humorless bark. \"Not at all. I would almost\r\ncertainly have lost my head to Dr. Guillotine's wonderful invention. Our\r\nlands would have been confiscated, and that would have been the end of\r\nthe family.\"\r\n\r\n\"But now, with most of the wealth in Raoul's hands--\"\r\n\r\nElysée raised a hand and shook his head. \"This is not the end. I do not\r\nbelieve in divine intervention, but I do believe there is a law of\r\nnature that says a bad man will do badly in the end.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste was about to reply when he heard footsteps coming down the road\r\ntoward the house, reminding him of how quiet it had been ever since he\r\nawakened. A good part of the town was sleeping off Raoul's Old Kaintuck,\r\nhe suspected.\r\n\r\nHe heard the door open and close below. A moment later Frank came into\r\nthe room carrying a long rifle, with an ammunition bag and a powder horn\r\nslung over his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I bought you a little bateau that will get you across the\r\nMississippi,\" he said, \"for five dollars, from an old trapper who\r\ndoesn't feel up to going out this winter. And for another twenty dollars\r\nI got him to throw in his second best rifle and a good supply of\r\nammunition.\" He smiled grimly at Auguste. \"I expect you'll find this\r\nuseful over in Ioway.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste nodded. \"I'll eat better. But--twenty-five dollars. Frank,\r\nthat's too much for you to spend on me.\" He felt a warm gratitude toward\r\nthe plump, sandy-haired man who was risking so much to help him. Frank's\r\nnewspaper, his printing business and his carpentry all together could\r\nhardly bring in twenty-five dollars in a month, little enough to feed a\r\nfamily of ten.\r\n\r\nElysée said, \"I told you I had some money salted away, Auguste. Let the\r\nboat and the rifle be my gift to you.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste reached out and squeezed his grandfather's bony hand.\r\n\r\nFrank said, \"I've moved the boat about half a mile below town and hidden\r\nit. We should be able to get down there unseen after dark.\"\r\n\r\nNicole said, \"If Auguste is leaving as Raoul wants him to, why wouldn't\r\nRaoul just let him go?\"\r\n\r\nFrank said, \"We can't take that chance. I believe Raoul won't be content\r\nunless he kills Auguste.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste shuddered inwardly at the thought that there was in the world a\r\nman who would not be satisfied until he was dead. He could not live with\r\nthat kind of fear. He asked the White Bear, his spirit guide, to give\r\nhim courage.\r\n\r\nHe tried to push the fear out of his mind. He stood up to go back to the\r\nroom where he had slept. He would clean and repack the things he was\r\ntaking, he decided. He would get busy getting ready and not give himself\r\ntime to think about being afraid.\r\n\r\nBut nightfall seemed a long way off.\r\n\r\nAt nine o'clock in the evening by the Seth Thomas clock in Frank's\r\nprinting shop, which he reset every day at sunset, it was dark enough\r\nand the town was quiet enough for Auguste to leave. He held Nicole's\r\nample body tight and kissed her, shook hands with the boys and kissed\r\nthe girls. His grandfather had drifted off to sleep again, but the old\r\nman had kissed him on both cheeks, and they had said their good-byes in\r\nthe afternoon.\r\n\r\nThe road down the bluff from the town to the bottomland was empty. Most\r\npeople in Victor went to bed soon after sunset, and those who didn't\r\nwould be up in the taproom of the trading post inn.\r\n\r\nAuguste did see candlelight flickering in a one-room log cabin they\r\npassed. A silhouette appeared in the window just as he looked in. A man\r\nreached out and slammed the shutters closed.\r\n\r\n\"Bad luck we should pass that house just as he came to the window,\"\r\nFrank said. \"One of Raoul's men. But he's more than likely still half\r\ndrunk.\"\r\n\r\nFrank and Auguste followed the road past fields of corn ready for\r\nharvesting, their way lighted by the nearly full moon.\r\n\r\nUp ahead the wooded sides of the bluff came down to the water's edge.\r\nFrank led Auguste out on a shrub-covered spit.\r\n\r\nNot until he was nearly on top of the bateau did Auguste see it. Frank\r\nhad pulled it up out of the water, covered it with branches, and tied it\r\nto the roots of a tree that had toppled into the water, undercut by the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nWith sinking heart Auguste saw that though the riverboat was small, it\r\nwould be heavier and harder to row than a canoe. Well, Frank had done\r\nhis best, and now he would have to do _his_ best.\r\n\r\nHis heart leaped with fear as he heard hoofbeats.\r\n\r\nHorsemen, coming down the road from Victor.\r\n\r\nFrank stopped working on the boat and lifted his head. \"Damn! That skunk\r\nmust have seen you after all.\"\r\n\r\nThe pounding was coming rapidly closer. Auguste's heart was beating as\r\nfast as the oncoming hooves. He saw the horsemen by moonlight--_five_ of\r\nthem, racing through the high corn.\r\n\r\nFrank and Auguste pushed the little boat into the water bow first,\r\npointed stern resting on the shore. Auguste put his pack in the stern\r\nand the rifle and ammunition in the bow, where they were more likely to\r\nstay dry. The current pulled the bow downstream, the flat bottom\r\ngrinding in the mud.\r\n\r\nAuguste saw a flash and heard a loud boom. Something whistled through\r\nthe bare branches of a bush beside him.\r\n\r\nHe leaped into the boat.\r\n\r\n\"Here. Beef and biscuit.\" Frank tossed a bag to Auguste, who set it on\r\nthe seat beside him. Frank pushed the bateau's stern free.\r\n\r\n\"Now row for your life!\"\r\n\r\nPulling as hard and fast as he could, Auguste steered diagonally into\r\nthe Mississippi, trying to get beyond pistol range without spending all\r\nhis strength fighting the current.\r\n\r\n\"Hopkins, goddamn it, I'll kill _you_ if he gets away!\"\r\n\r\nRaoul's voice. Auguste wished he had time to load his rifle and shoot\r\nback, but if he stopped rowing they were sure to get him.\r\n\r\nFive bright red flashes and five shots roared out one after the other\r\nfrom shore.\r\n\r\n_If one of those men is Eli Greenglove I'm dead for sure._\r\n\r\nAuguste heard a sharp rap on the side of the boat and splashes in the\r\nwater on his left. He felt naked sitting up in the boat pulling\r\nfrantically on the oars. He could stop rowing and lie down using the\r\nside of the boat as a shield, but then he would remain within range,\r\ndrifting south along the riverbank, and Raoul and his men could follow\r\nhim and shoot at him at their leisure. He gritted his teeth and kept\r\nrowing, his shoulder muscles feeling as if they were about to tear loose\r\nfrom his bones.\r\n\r\nHe heard a ball whiz past his head. They must have stopped riding to\r\nreload and take better aim.\r\n\r\nAnother ball smashed into the boat just ahead of the wooden oarlock.\r\n\r\nHis body was coated with the cold sweat of fear. There was nothing he\r\ncould do but sit here, a target in the moonlight, and pull on the oars\r\nwith all his strength. If he missed one stroke it might be his death.\r\n\r\n_Earthmaker, do not let Raoul take revenge on Frank._\r\n\r\nPistol balls splashed water into the boat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11\r\n\r\nRedbird's Wickiup\r\n\r\n\r\nWhite Bear rowed upstream on the Ioway River past stands of weeping\r\nwillow whose yellowing fronds drooped into the dark green water. Even\r\nthough the current was at its weakest now, his arms and shoulders felt\r\nas if they'd been beaten with clubs. If only Frank had been able to find\r\na canoe for him instead of this heavy bateau that he'd had to push\r\nacross the Great River and now up the Ioway.\r\n\r\nHis heart fluttered in his chest like a trapped bird as he sensed\r\nhimself coming closer to the British Band's winter hunting camp. He had\r\nthought he would be happy at this homecoming, but he was terrified.\r\n\r\nHow would they receive him? After six years they must think he had\r\nforgotten all about them. Would they despise him? Maybe they would just\r\nmake fun of him.\r\n\r\nAnd in what state would he find the British Band? They'd had to get\r\nthrough the summer without the crops they always raised. Had any friends\r\nbeen shot by white snipers during the siege of Saukenuk? How many,\r\nweakened by hunger, might be ill or dead? Would his mother be alive?\r\n\r\nAnd what of Redbird?\r\n\r\nHe had already met, just by chance, one member of the band, Three\r\nHorses, who had been fishing in the shallows on the Ioway shore of the\r\nGreat River. And Three Horses had certainly been happy to see him. He'd\r\njumped on his pony and had said he would ride back to the camp with the\r\nnews that White Bear was back. He was so excited that he did not wait\r\nfor White Bear to ask any questions about how his people had fared.\r\n\r\nSo they would all be waiting for him by the time he got there. The\r\nthought frightened him all the more.\r\n\r\nAhead, a row of bark and dugout canoes lay bottoms up on a dirt\r\nembankment.\r\n\r\nHe saw a flash of red in the trees near the canoes. For a moment he\r\nthought, with a joyous leap of his heart, that it might be Redbird. Then\r\na man wearing a deep red blanket stepped out of the woods. He stood over\r\nthe beached canoes with his arms folded.\r\n\r\nWolf Paw.\r\n\r\nHis eyes were like splinters of coal, and the black circles he had\r\npainted around them gave him a terrifying aspect. The crest of red-dyed\r\ndeer hair that sprouted from his shaven skull seemed strange and savage\r\nto White Bear after six years away from the Sauk.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear rowed in close to the riverbank, uncertain how to greet Wolf\r\nPaw. The brave said nothing, did nothing. A maple branch swayed in the\r\nwind. Red leaves fell, and sunlight flashed from a steel-headed tomahawk\r\nthat Wolf Paw was holding.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear's belly knotted.\r\n\r\nHe skidded the boat to a halt on the bank a short distance downriver\r\nfrom Wolf Paw. He climbed out the front end, pulled the boat up on the\r\nbank, unloaded it and turned it over.\r\n\r\nWolf Paw watched in silence as White Bear slung his pack and bags on his\r\nback, picked up his rifle and rested it on his shoulder. Looking at Wolf\r\nPaw's red crest and blanket and buckskin trousers, White Bear realized\r\nhow strange he himself must seem to Wolf Paw in the green clawhammer\r\njacket he had worn to his father's funeral.\r\n\r\nNow they were face to face.\r\n\r\n_I will wait for him to move, if I have to stand here till sunset and\r\nall through the night. He chose this strange way of meeting me. Let him\r\nshow me what is in his mind._\r\n\r\nHe heard the boughs creaking in the wind around him. River water rippled\r\nover the stones along the bank. He heard a redbird whistling in the\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nWolf Paw drew a deep breath, opened his mouth and let out a war whoop.\r\n\r\n\"_Whoowhoowhoowhoo!_\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear's heart gave a great thump, and he fell back a step. He heard\r\nrage in the whoop, and the frustration. Wolf Paw was angry at him. Why?\r\nMaybe just for coming back.\r\n\r\nWolf Paw held the tomahawk high. Corded muscles and dark veins stood out\r\nin his rigid arm. Two feathers dyed red danced just under the steel\r\nhead. He repeated his war whoop, and then his lips drew back from\r\nclenched white teeth.\r\n\r\nHe whirled and plunged into the woods, leaving White Bear shaken and\r\nopen-mouthed. He stood still, listening to Wolf Paw crashing through the\r\ntrees and shrubs, kicking piles of leaves, until the noise died away in\r\nthe distance. No Sauk ran noisily through the woods like that, unless\r\ndriven by some madness.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear sighed. Oddly, he felt less frightened than he had before he\r\nmet Wolf Paw. Before, he had not known what to expect. Now he felt ready\r\nfor anything.\r\n\r\nHe strode into the woods following Three Horses' directions. As he\r\nwalked he began to hear the sounds of people's voices and dogs barking.\r\nGradually they drew nearer, until at last he broke through the trees\r\ninto a clearing.\r\n\r\nThe sight made his eyes brim with tears.\r\n\r\nA hundred or more women in brown, fringed skirts were facing him, and as\r\nhe came forward they rushed to form a ring around him. His vision\r\nblurred as he recognized faces he had not seen in six years.\r\n\r\nBeyond the women he could see the camp of the British Band. In his joy\r\nit seemed to him that the wickiups were bathed in a golden light. Rings\r\nof gray domes began near the trees where he stood and spread into the\r\ntall yellow prairie grass. Before the wickiups he could see what the\r\nwomen had been working at, tasks abandoned for the moment, clothing\r\nbeing mended, skins stretched, meat and fish cleaned and set on frames\r\nto dry.\r\n\r\n\"White Bear is here!\" cried one woman, and he recognized Water Flows\r\nFast, plump wife of Three Horses.\r\n\r\nThree Horses, a short man with broad shoulders, stood beside his wife.\r\nHis nose was flat and spread out. White Bear did not remember it that\r\nway. Something must have happened to Three Horses while he was gone.\r\n\r\n_Much has happened to them while I was gone._\r\n\r\n\"I told you White Bear had come back,\" Three Horses said over and over\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear breathed in the familiar smells of campfire smoke and\r\nroasting meat, of leather and freshly cut wood and tobacco smoke. His\r\ndelighted eyes took in quillwork and beadwork and paint, blankets and\r\nribbons, bodies clad in fringed buckskin, warm brown faces, dark,\r\nfriendly eyes.\r\n\r\nMurmuring greetings, he searched the crowd for specially loved faces.\r\n\r\n\"Where is Owl Carver?\" he asked. After such a long time the Sauk\r\nlanguage came awkwardly to his lips.\r\n\r\nThree Horses said, \"Owl Carver visits the camps of the Fox and the\r\nKickapoo, to invite them to Black Hawk's council.\"\r\n\r\n_What is Black Hawk planning now?_\r\n\r\nWhite Bear did not like the sound of the news, but there would be time\r\nto think about it later.\r\n\r\n\"Where is Sun Woman, my mother?\"\r\n\r\nWater Flows Fast spoke up. \"She has gone to gather medicine plants.\" She\r\nlooked as cheerful as, he remembered, she always had, but her eyes\r\npenetrated him.\r\n\r\n\"Will no one find her and tell her that I am here?\"\r\n\r\nWater Flows Fast said, \"Redbird should go and tell Sun Woman. Redbird\r\nlives with Sun Woman now.\"\r\n\r\n_Redbird!_\r\n\r\nHe felt almost dizzy at the sound of her name, a name he had not heard\r\nspoken aloud in six years.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Water Flows Fast spoke, she started to giggle, putting her\r\nhands over her mouth. Many of the other women in the group giggled too.\r\nWhite Bear wanted to hide his burning face. He had forgotten how painful\r\nit could be to be made fun of by those who knew him so well.\r\n\r\nBut joy blazed up in his chest. Redbird living with Sun Woman? He wanted\r\nto whoop with happiness, even as Wolf Paw had whooped with rage. That\r\ncould only mean that she had not taken a husband.\r\n\r\nThen he took a deep breath and stiffened his body to hide his feelings.\r\nHe looked at the laughing faces all around him, especially the bright,\r\ncurious eyes of Water Flows Fast. If they saw how excited he was, they\r\nwould laugh at him all the more.\r\n\r\nTrying to keep his voice steady, he asked, \"Where is my mother's\r\nwickiup?\"\r\n\r\nWith a knowing smile--but what was it that she knew?--Water Flows Fast\r\nbeckoned to the wickiup of Sun Woman--and Redbird. \"Come. I will take\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nShe turned, her fringed skirt swinging. The women parted to make way for\r\nher. Shouldering his rifle, White Bear followed. Three Horses walked\r\nbeside him. White Bear heard the whisper of many moccasins and the\r\nmurmur of many voices behind him.\r\n\r\nWater Flows Fast marched up to a wickiup near the center of the camp.\r\nThe dark, rounded shelter of sheets of elm bark and tree limbs was\r\nsmall, just big enough for two people, three at the most.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear's heart was beating like a dance drum. The buffalo-hide flap\r\nwas pulled down over the door, showing that if anyone was within they\r\nwanted privacy.\r\n\r\n\"The wickiup of Sun Woman,\" said Water Flows Fast. \"And of Redbird.\" She\r\nlooked at him expectantly.\r\n\r\n\"There is no one here,\" said White Bear.\r\n\r\nThis brought shouts of laughter from the women around him. He wished\r\nthey would all go away.\r\n\r\n\"I saw Redbird go in there,\" said Water Flows Fast, \"and I did not see\r\nher come out.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear's discomfort increased as he watched her face redden and her\r\ncheeks puff out. It seemed that mirth would make her burst.\r\n\r\nEvery beat of his heart seemed to shake his whole body. He looked around\r\nslowly, trying to calm himself. Even if Redbird had waited for him, his\r\nsudden return must have shocked her. She needed time to prepare herself\r\nto meet him. And, like him, she did not want all these women watching\r\ntheir meeting and laughing. He would simply have to wait until Redbird\r\nwas ready to greet him.\r\n\r\nA rack of crisscrossed wooden sticks for drying skins stood by the\r\nclosed doorway. Slowly, deliberately, he walked over to the rack, leaned\r\nhis rifle against it, and laid down his pack and bags.\r\n\r\nThen, turning his back on the wickiup, he sat down cross-legged on the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nWater Flows Fast looked at him, open-mouthed.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you for showing me the way,\" he said. Hiding his embarrassment,\r\nhe made himself smile at the hundred or more women gathered to watch\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do?\" Water Flows Fast asked.\r\n\r\n\"I am going to rest and thank Earthmaker for seeing me here safely.\"\r\n\r\n\"White Bear is a man of sense,\" said Three Horses, smiling his approval.\r\n\r\n\"Is that all?\" Water Flows Fast asked.\r\n\r\n\"I am going to wait for Sun Woman, my mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is _that_ all?\"\r\n\r\n\"That _is_ all,\" said White Bear.\r\n\r\nThree Horses, who was no taller than his wife, gripped her plump upper\r\narm firmly. \"Let White Bear alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"But--\" Water Flows Fast started to protest, and her husband jerked her\r\narm.\r\n\r\n\"We will leave this man in peace,\" he said.\r\n\r\nHer lower lip jutting out, Water Flows Fast let Three Horses pull her\r\naway through the crowd.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear sat with his eyes downcast to discourage people from talking\r\nto him. Gradually the rest of the crowd dispersed.\r\n\r\nThe back of his neck bristled. He knew Redbird was in the wickiup behind\r\nhim. Sooner or later she must come out.\r\n\r\nTo have her so close after all this time, to know she was there and to\r\nhear nothing but that terrible silence, and yet to sit with his back to\r\nthat buffalo-hide curtain, all this was a torment for him. The urge to\r\njump up and tear the curtain away pressed against his resolve to hold\r\nhimself still. He thought he might explode like a barrel of gunpowder.\r\n\r\nHe forced himself to breathe slowly and pretend that he was hidden in\r\nshrubbery with a bow and arrow, watching for a deer.\r\n\r\nAfter a time--he could not tell how much time--a face was peering into\r\nhis. Dark and square. The brown eyes brimmed with tears.\r\n\r\nHis eyes opened wider. Sun Woman was kneeling before him.\r\n\r\n\"My son.\" She reached out to him, and he scrambled to embrace her. When\r\nher strong arms held him he felt like a little boy again.\r\n\r\nHe sat back to look at her dear face, wet with tears. Resting beside her\r\non the ground was the familiar basket with blue cloth cover that she\r\nused to gather herbs.\r\n\r\nHe looked around for the sun. It was low and red on the western horizon.\r\nIt had been high when he sat down here. He must have gone on a spirit\r\nwalk.\r\n\r\n\"I knew it would be like this,\" Sun Woman said. \"It would come one day\r\nwhen I least expected it--my son would be back again.\"\r\n\r\nHe sighed deeply. \"To see my mother makes my heart as big as the\r\nprairie.\"\r\n\r\nThey sat facing each other and she gripped his shoulders. \"You are a man\r\nnow, a very handsome man.\" She ran her hand along his cheek, and his\r\nwhole face felt warm. He kept his gaze fixed on her eyes.\r\n\r\nShe said, \"You have learned much. You have been hurt. Your face is\r\nscarred.\" She followed the line of the scar with her thumb, leaning\r\nforward to peer still more closely at him. \"I see sadness in you. Your\r\nfather is dead. That is why you have come back.\"\r\n\r\nShe sat back and closed her eyes for a silent moment. Then she began a\r\nsong for the dead.\r\n\r\n    \"Earthmaker, show him the way.\r\n    Lead him over the bridge of stars and sunbeams,\r\n    Along the westward Trail of Souls.\r\n    Take his soul into your heart.\"\r\n\r\nAfter she had finished the song, Sun Woman wiped the tears from her face\r\nwith her blunt fingers. She reached out and stroked his cheeks as well.\r\nHe had not realized that he was crying.\r\n\r\nBut grieving for Pierre reminded him to reach into his medicine bag.\r\n\r\n\"I have a gift for you, Mother.\" He took out the flat silver case with\r\nits velvet neck cord, opened it and showed her the pair of spectacles\r\nMarchette had brought to him from Victoire. \"Do you know these?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your father wore circles of glass like these. To see the marks on the\r\ntalking paper.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. These are the same ones.\" He closed the case and pressed it into\r\nher hand. \"Now you have something that was close to Star Arrow.\"\r\n\r\nShe said, \"He was with me for five summers only, but in spirit, ever\r\nsince. Now I will feel even closer to him.\" She slipped the ribbon over\r\nher head and dropped the case down the front of her doeskin dress.\r\n\r\nHe saw the tracks of more tears on her smooth brown cheeks in the fading\r\nlight. This time she did not wipe them away.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me all that has happened to you,\" she said.\r\n\r\nAs White Bear talked, he deliberately made his voice loud enough to\r\ncarry, so that Redbird, in the wickiup, might hear.\r\n\r\nWhen he was through telling his story, he felt weighed down by guilt.\r\n\r\n\"I fled, Mother, even though I promised my father I would care for the\r\nland. And smoked tobacco with him to seal the promise. Should I have\r\nstayed?\"\r\n\r\nShe put her hand on his shoulder and squeezed. \"You kept your promise as\r\nfar as you were able. That is all the calumet requires. Your father\r\nwould not want you to die fighting for that land. It is better that you\r\ncome back here and be a Sauk again.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear looked down, unable to meet Sun Woman's eyes. Feeling an ache\r\ndeep in the center of his body, remembering the great stone and log\r\nhouse, the blizzard of blossoms in the orchards, the fields of green\r\ncorn and golden wheat, the herds that darkened the hillsides, he wanted\r\nto clutch his chest where it felt as if it had been torn open. He could\r\nnot so easily forget Victoire.\r\n\r\n_When I was at Victoire I yearned to go back to my people. Now I am with\r\nmy people and I miss Victoire. Will my heart never be at peace?_\r\n\r\nNancy had wanted him so desperately before they parted; Redbird would\r\nnot even let him see her.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear saw that once again women had started to gather nearby, among\r\nthem the round-faced Water Flows Fast. And now White Bear saw another\r\nfamiliar face he had not seen earlier, Redbird's mother, Wind Bends\r\nGrass. She glowered at him as she always had, her fists on her broad\r\nhips.\r\n\r\n_O Earthmaker! Why would Redbird not come out and speak to him?_\r\n\r\nA dozen cawing crows flew over the camp. Laughing at him.\r\n\r\nHe heard a movement behind him, a rustling of the buffalo-hide curtain.\r\nHe dared not look around.\r\n\r\nA voice at his back said, \"Go away, White Bear!\"\r\n\r\nA cool, sweet flow poured from his heart like a mountain spring at the\r\nsound of Redbird's voice. He unfolded his legs, stiff from hours of\r\nsitting, and pushed himself to his feet. He turned.\r\n\r\nWeakness washed over him; he thought he might fall to the ground.\r\nRedbird stood before him, her cheeks flushed, her slanting eyes\r\nsparkling with anger. Her face was thinner than he remembered, her lips\r\nfuller. She still wore a fringe of her hair over her forehead.\r\n\r\nStanding silent and open-mouthed, he felt he must look utterly foolish.\r\n\r\n\"Go away,\" Redbird said again. \"We do not want you here.\"\r\n\r\n\"To see you is a sunrise in my heart, Redbird.\"\r\n\r\n\"To see you is a foul day in my stomach!\"\r\n\r\nReeling back from her anger, White Bear saw a little boy standing in the\r\ndoorway behind her.\r\n\r\nHe was bare-chested, brown-skinned. He wore a loincloth of red flannel\r\nand fringed buckskin leggings. He was shifting uncomfortably from one\r\nmoccasined foot to the other and clutching at himself under the\r\nloincloth.\r\n\r\nNow White Bear understood why Redbird had finally come out. She and the\r\nboy must have been inside the wickiup all the time he was sitting out\r\nhere, and the boy was about to burst.\r\n\r\nIt would have been funny, except that a much more important discovery\r\nstruck White Bear.\r\n\r\nHe looked closer at the boy's urgent eyes. Blue eyes.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear's own eyes were brown, but Pierre's were blue. Could eye\r\ncolor be passed in the blood from grandfather to grandson? Around his\r\neyes, in the narrow shape of his head, his long chin coming to a sharp\r\npoint, White Bear could see that this boy was a de Marion.\r\n\r\n_This is our son! Redbird's and mine!_\r\n\r\nJoy blazed up in his body like a fire that warms but does not hurt.\r\n\r\nHe asked, \"What is his name, Redbird?\"\r\n\r\nShe glanced over her shoulder at the boy. \"What are you standing there\r\nfor? You have to go. Go!\" The boy ran off toward the woods. White Bear\r\nwatched him. He ran well, even though he was very young and most\r\nuncomfortable.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear wanted to reach out and take Redbird into his arms.\r\n\r\nShe turned back to him, her fists clenched at her sides, her nostrils\r\nflaring in fury.\r\n\r\n\"_Now_ you want to know what his name is. Now, five winters after he was\r\nborn.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned to Sun Woman. \"Does she have a husband?\"\r\n\r\nSun Woman raised her eyebrows. \"There were many braves who wished to\r\nmarry her. Wolf Paw was most insistent. He offered Owl Carver ten\r\nhorses. Little Stabbing Chief of the Fox sought her. There were others,\r\nbesides.\"\r\n\r\nWolf Paw had wanted to marry her. That must have been the meaning of\r\nthat strange encounter outside the camp. Wolf Paw probably wanted to\r\nkill him.\r\n\r\n\"Please, Sun Woman, do not talk to this man about me,\" Redbird said.\r\n\"You are his mother, and a mother to me. But you cannot make peace\r\nbetween us.\"\r\n\r\n\"True,\" said Sun Woman, picking up her basket of herbs and bark. \"Only\r\nyou can do that, daughter.\"\r\n\r\nShe turned to White Bear. \"If Redbird does not welcome you into this\r\nwickiup I share with her and Eagle Feather, I cannot invite you inside.\"\r\n\r\nWith that Sun Woman turned abruptly and trudged off toward the river.\r\n\r\n_Eagle Feather!_\r\n\r\nRedbird threw an exasperated look after Sun Woman.\r\n\r\nRedbird's anger made White Bear feel as if one of the long knives'\r\ncannonballs had crushed his chest. Perhaps if he could put his arms\r\naround her she would remember how she had loved him. He took a step\r\ntoward her, reaching for her.\r\n\r\nShe stepped back quickly, bent down and picked up a rock. \"Go away.\r\nNow!\"\r\n\r\n_How graceful all her movements are._\r\n\r\nThe rock was gray and somewhat larger than her fist. It had sharp,\r\nirregular edges and looked as if it had been used to chip arrowheads.\r\n\r\nHe said, \"You would not be this angry at me if you did not want me back.\r\nWhy did you refuse every man who asked for you?\"\r\n\r\nHer face twisted with rage, she threw the rock.\r\n\r\nFor an instant he was blinded as it hit his cheek, stunning him, and his\r\nhead snapped back.\r\n\r\nHe felt a pounding pain in the back of his skull as his vision cleared.\r\nThe ache from being hit with a rifle butt had come back.\r\n\r\nHe heard gasps of dismay from some of the watching women, laughter from\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nWind Bends Grass called out scornfully, \"I am ashamed to call this fool\r\nmy daughter. I cast her out of my lodge because she would accept no\r\nsuitors. At last comes the one who ruined her for all the others, and\r\nshe drives him away with a rock. I think we should throw rocks at her.\"\r\n\r\nThe crowd's laughter was louder, although White Bear saw that Wind Bends\r\nGrass did not mean to be funny.\r\n\r\nHis left cheekbone throbbed, the cheek Raoul's knife had scarred, and he\r\nfelt a trickle of blood. But he would not let himself lift his hand to\r\nwipe it away.\r\n\r\nRedbird's hand went up to her own face, as if the rock had hit her. Her\r\nslanting eyes widened with a look of horror.\r\n\r\nShe whirled and ducked through her dark doorway.\r\n\r\n\"Go in there after her, White Bear!\" one of the women called.\r\n\r\nHe would not do that. He would not go into her wickiup until she invited\r\nhim. And in spite of the heaviness in his heart, in spite of the ache in\r\nhis cheekbone and the pounding in his head, he believed that sooner or\r\nlater invite him she would.\r\n\r\nHe turned his back on the empty doorway and sat down again.\r\n\r\nThe blue-eyed, brown-skinned boy was standing before him. A golden glow\r\nfilled White Bear's chest.\r\n\r\n\"You are hurt,\" said the boy.\r\n\r\n\"It is nothing, Eagle Feather. A man must endure pain without\r\ncomplaint.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did my mother do that to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"She wanted to punish me for staying away from you and her for so long.\r\nMy name is White Bear.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know what your name is.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he heard that, he was sure that he would win her back.\r\n\r\nThe boy darted around him.\r\n\r\nResting his hands on his knees, White Bear closed his eyes and let his\r\nmind dwell on a vast white-furred shape. Owl Carver had said that when a\r\nman wished to send his spirit on a journey in the other world, he need\r\nonly think of his other self.\r\n\r\nHe saw the huge golden eyes, the massive, long-muzzled head, the\r\ntowering body.\r\n\r\nSoon he and the Bear spirit were walking together toward the sun.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRedbird did not understand herself. She hated White Bear, but when she\r\nsaw blood running down his face, she had hated herself. She sat in\r\ndarkness, biting her lips to keep from screaming.\r\n\r\nShe crept to the doorway and pushed the curtain open a crack. She could\r\nsee him sitting again with his back to her, his shoulders broad in his\r\ngreen pale eyes' coat.\r\n\r\nShe drew back into the wickiup and saw the small steel knife she used\r\nto cut up food gleaming near the embers of her fire. She picked it up\r\nand held its edge against her feverish cheek.\r\n\r\nThe last light of day fell on her as the doorway curtain rose. Startled,\r\nshe almost cut herself. She whirled to see Eagle Feather staring at her.\r\nShe threw the knife down on the straw-covered floor.\r\n\r\nEagle Feather gave her a questioning look but said nothing.\r\n\r\nShe drew him down beside her and started telling him the story of why\r\nthe leaves change colors and fall to the ground in autumn.\r\n\r\nIt was dark outside when Sun Woman came back from the river, where she\r\nhad been washing the plants she had gathered. Redbird was afraid Sun\r\nWoman would ask her to forgive White Bear, but the older woman said\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nThey passed what seemed like an ordinary evening, talking and telling\r\nstories and singing. But Redbird could not forget that figure sitting\r\nlike a tree stump just beyond the buffalo-hide curtain.\r\n\r\nMuch later she went out, and by the light from tonight's full Moon of\r\nFalling Leaves, looked into White Bear's face. It was motionless, as if\r\ncarved from wood.\r\n\r\nHe did not seem to see her. He must be on a spirit journey. Hot with\r\nrage, she kicked at his knee. What right had he to go on a spirit\r\njourney leaving his body to haunt her wickiup?\r\n\r\nThe impact of her moccasined foot shook him slightly, but it was like\r\nkicking a bundle of pelts.\r\n\r\nRedbird's breath came out in a cloud, lit by the full moon. She gathered\r\nup some twigs, brought them into the wickiup and added them to the fire.\r\nSun Woman went out carrying a blanket. Redbird saw her draping it over\r\nher son's shoulders.\r\n\r\n_He does not need that_, Redbird thought, remembering how White Bear had\r\ncome back, seemingly frozen, from his vision quest in the Moon of Ice.\r\n\r\nTightly wrapped in her own blankets with Eagle Feather curled up in the\r\nshelter of her body, Redbird lay awake, thinking that she had never in\r\nher life slept with a man. That was White Bear's fault, and she ground\r\nher teeth in the dark as she thought of the wrongs he had done her.\r\n\r\n_He left me in the Moon of First Buds, and he returns in the Moon of\r\nFalling Leaves--six summers later._\r\n\r\nOne afternoon they had been lovers. And then he had gone to live with\r\nthe pale eyes. For nine moons she had carried his son and then given\r\nbirth to him. He had not been here to give the baby a birth name. Owl\r\nCarver, the baby's grandfather, had to do that, embarrassed at the\r\nnecessity, complaining that the people were laughing at their family.\r\nShe knew Star Arrow had required that no messages pass between White\r\nBear and the tribe. But if White Bear really loved her, could he not\r\nhave broken that rule--even if he had smoked the calumet with Star\r\nArrow--at least once? For six summers White Bear had been as silent, as\r\nabsent, as if he were dead.\r\n\r\n_Even the dead sometimes send a sign._\r\n\r\nThe next day the sky was cloudy, and the air warmer than last night. All\r\nmorning long women walked past Redbird's wickiup, looking curiously at\r\nthe man who sat there motionless. Like Redbird herself, they had never\r\nbefore seen a man while his spirit had gone to walk the bridge of stars.\r\nWhen men went on spirit journeys they always retired to the forest or to\r\ncaves.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon He Who Sits in Grease, a Fox brave, came to Redbird as\r\nshe and Sun Woman sat before their doorway plaiting baskets, a short\r\ndistance from White Bear. The brave was carrying a stout bustard with\r\nfeathers striped brown, black and white. He hunkered down facing her and\r\nlaid the bird before her.\r\n\r\nHis thick lips worked nervously. \"This is for White Bear,\" he said.\r\n\"When he wakes up. It is the fattest of the three that I killed this\r\nmorning. Tell him that He Who Sits in Grease gives him this gift. I want\r\nhim to ask Earthmaker to make the animals come to me more willingly when\r\nI hunt them.\"\r\n\r\nBefore Redbird could protest, the brave stood up and backed away, his\r\neyes timidly averted from the figure outside the doorway.\r\n\r\n_He thinks White Bear is holy!_ The thought made her more angry at White\r\nBear than ever. She wanted to kick him again, but women were watching\r\nfrom a distance, and she knew they would make fun of her.\r\n\r\n\"Get _up_,\" she said softly to White Bear. \"Go _away_,\" she said,\r\ngrinding her teeth.\r\n\r\nShe wished Owl Carver would come back from visiting the other camps to\r\nput a stop to White Bear's torturing her like this.\r\n\r\n_But he might force me to accept White Bear as my man._\r\n\r\nAmazingly, she felt a lift in her heart at this thought. She herself\r\ncould never forgive White Bear, but if Owl Carver, her father and the\r\nshaman of the British Band, ordered her to, the decision would be made\r\nfor her.\r\n\r\nThen, at least, this torment would end.\r\n\r\nSun Woman silently picked up the bustard, sat down and began plucking\r\nthe feathers, piling them in a basket to use for adornments and bedding.\r\n\r\nTo escape from being rubbed raw by White Bear's presence, Redbird went\r\nout into the woods along the Ioway River, as Sun Woman had done\r\nyesterday, to gather herbs. The medicine plants were at their most\r\npowerful now, because they had been gaining strength all summer long.\r\n\r\nLate in the day the sky darkened rapidly. The purple-gray clouds seemed\r\nto hang so low that she could reach up and touch them. She heard the\r\nfirst drops pattering on the branches above her. As the rain started to\r\nfall faster, it drummed on her head and shoulders. Sighing at having to\r\ngive up this comforting work, she put a lid on her basket, stood up and\r\nstarted back for the camp.\r\n\r\nHer doeskin shirt and skirt kept the rain off her body, but her hair was\r\nsoaked and her face was streaming by the time she got back to the\r\nwickiup. She would build up the fire and dry herself off. Its heat would\r\nfeel so good. She hoped Eagle Feather and Sun Woman were already inside.\r\n\r\nShe stopped before the silent, sitting figure outside the wickiup. The\r\nbrown blanket was pulled up over his head. Sun Woman must have done\r\nthat. The blanket was sodden with rain, and he looked like a rock\r\ngrowing out of the ground.\r\n\r\nThe beating of rain filled her ears.\r\n\r\nShe squatted down and looked into his face. Water ran in rivulets down\r\nfrom the blanket into his half-closed eyes. He did not even blink.\r\n\r\nShe shivered. The cold rain was coming down so hard she could not see\r\nmost of the camp. A lump blocked her throat.\r\n\r\n\"Come inside,\" she said. She had to raise her voice to hear it over the\r\ndrumming of the rain.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear neither spoke nor moved.\r\n\r\n\"Come in. It is raining. It is cold. You will die out here.\" She\r\nrealized she was screaming at him.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" she cried helplessly.\r\n\r\nShe sat on the ground, looking into the rain-slick, light-complexioned\r\nface with the strong nose and the long jaw that she had loved long ago,\r\nthe face she had thought about so many times and had seen so often in\r\ndreams. A black crust of blood had dried over the place where her rock\r\nhad gashed his cheek. On the same cheek a raised white line ran from\r\njust under his eye to the corner of his mouth.\r\n\r\nTo try to wake a man on a spirit journey could be dangerous for him.\r\n\r\nBut her hands seemed to have a will of their own. She had to touch him.\r\nShe reached out, clutching his shoulders through the sopping blanket,\r\nheedless of the rain pouring down her own face, running under the collar\r\nof her doeskin shirt down her back and chest. She shook him.\r\n\r\n\"Get up! Come in out of the rain!\"\r\n\r\nHis body felt lifeless when she shook him. But did she see a flicker in\r\nhis eyes?\r\n\r\n\"Please, White Bear, please!\"\r\n\r\nHe blinked.\r\n\r\nShe threw her arms around him.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, White Bear! I do want you back.\"\r\n\r\nShe crawled closer to him, pushing her body against his rigid form.\r\n\r\nShe felt pressure against her back, pulling her closer to him. His hand.\r\n\r\nThen his other hand.\r\n\r\nShe felt his chest rising and falling against hers.\r\n\r\nStrong arms were holding her.\r\n\r\nShe looked up into his face, and color had come into the pale cheeks.\r\nThe brown eyes were looking down at her, warm with love. She forgot the\r\nrain and the cold, and nestled in his arms.\r\n\r\nShe saw tears spill out of his eyes, mingling with the rain on his face.\r\nShe, too, was crying. She had been crying ever since she sat down with\r\nhim. She held him tight.\r\n\r\nLooking past him, she saw in the doorway of the wickiup the small form\r\nof Eagle Feather, staring at them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12\r\n\r\nThe War Whoop\r\n\r\n\r\nOwl Carver held the watch up by its chain; his smile of approval showed\r\nhe'd lost a tooth in front since White Bear left with Star Arrow.\r\n\r\n\"A handsome gift. I thank you for it. But what do you mean by saying it\r\ntells us the time? Do we not _know_ the time?\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear scoured his brain for a way to explain.\r\n\r\nSitting close to the old shaman, White Bear saw that age had bent him a\r\nbit more and carved deeper lines in his brown face. Besides the\r\nmegis-shell necklace White Bear remembered, Owl Carver wore a new\r\nnecklace made of tiny beads forming a red, yellow, blue and white floral\r\ndesign, from which hung a sunburst pendant.\r\n\r\nThey sat facing each other in front of the shaman's wickiup in the\r\ncenter of the British Band's winter camp. In the fenced-off corral\r\ndozens of horses stamped their hooves and blew steamy breath into the\r\ngray sky. The hunters had returned with braces of pheasant and geese,\r\nwith deer slung from poles, with buffalo and elk carcasses mounted on\r\ntravois dragging behind their horses. White Bear felt his nostrils\r\nexpand to take in the smells of meats being roasted and stewed. In a few\r\ndays all the chiefs of the Sauk and Fox, along with representatives of\r\nthe Winnebago, Potawatomi and Kickapoo, would be gathering here at Black\r\nHawk's invitation.\r\n\r\nEven sooner, though, a ceremony would take place that meant much more to\r\nWhite Bear. Tomorrow night he and Redbird would at last be married. And\r\nhe had come to Redbird's father today to give him the only present he\r\nhad to offer.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear pointed to the dial of the watch. \"Father of my bride, if\r\nyou want to know when the sun will rise tomorrow, you look at where\r\nthese two arrows are at sunrise today. When they are in the same place\r\nagain, it will be half the time till the next sunrise. When they are in\r\nthe same place after that, it will be sunrise the next day.\" He\r\nfaltered. To himself, his explanation sounded at once useless and\r\nridiculously complicated. \"... Almost. In truth, the sun does not rise\r\nat the same time every day,\" he finished weakly.\r\n\r\nOwl Carver stared at him as if he had uttered nonsense. \"The sun rises\r\nat sunrise.\"\r\n\r\nHe remembered how Frank Hopkins always reset his clock at sunset. \"Yes,\r\nbut in summer the days are long and in winter the days are short. But\r\nthe arrows on this watch cannot keep pace with the sun.\"\r\n\r\nOwl Carver shook his head. \"Many things the pale eyes make are useful,\r\nbut I do not understand the use of this thing.\"\r\n\r\n_What a struggle!_\r\n\r\nWhite Bear had a sudden inspiration. \"It is true, this watch cannot tell\r\nyou as much as the sun does, but it can tell you one thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is that?\" Owl Carver frowned, weighing the watch in his hand.\r\n\r\n\"It can tell you when a pale eyes will do something.\"\r\n\r\nOwl Carver grunted. \"Well, it is pretty to look at. And it moves and\r\nmakes sounds.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear snapped open the back of the case, where the key was kept,\r\nand showed Owl Carver how to wind the watch, impressing on him the need\r\nto handle it very gently. Then the shaman went into his wickiup to put\r\nthe watch in his medicine bundle.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear sighed. He missed talking with Elysée, missed the library at\r\nVictoire, from which he'd managed to take only one book.\r\n\r\n_Well, this world of sky and trees and rivers and animals is a library\r\ntoo. Owl Carver knows how to read in it, and he has taught me._\r\n\r\nThe old shaman came out with a long-stemmed pipe. He filled and lit it\r\nwith a twig from the fire in his wickiup and smoked thoughtfully for a\r\nwhile before speaking. White Bear, sensing that Owl Carver had something\r\nimportant to say to him, waited quietly.\r\n\r\n\"We need to know more about the pale eyes than we can learn from that\r\ntime-teller,\" Owl Carver said. \"We need to know what they will do if we\r\ncross the Great River to Saukenuk next spring.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear felt his heartbeat quicken.\r\n\r\n\"Is that what Black Hawk plans?\"\r\n\r\n\"If he can get enough Sauk and Fox warriors and their families to follow\r\nhim. At the council all the chiefs will hear Black Hawk. The Winnebago\r\nProphet, Flying Cloud, is coming to the council from his town up the\r\nRock River. He will add his voice to Black Hawk's. But the chiefs will\r\nalso hear the snake's voice of He Who Moves Alertly.\" He spat\r\ncontemptuously.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear knew well why Owl Carver despised He Who Moves Alertly.\r\nDuring what the pale eyes called the War of 1812, while Black Hawk and\r\nhis warriors were away fighting on the British side, the civil chiefs\r\nhad appointed He Who Moves Alertly a war chief in case the Americans\r\nshould attack the Sauk towns on the Great River. Not only had the new\r\nwar chief never fought, he spoke much of the need to make peace with the\r\nAmericans. He had about as many followers among the Sauk and Fox as\r\nBlack Hawk did, people who believed that the tribes would fare best if\r\nthey did whatever the pale eyes demanded. After the war He Who Moves\r\nAlertly was quick to make himself known to the Americans as a friend. In\r\nturn the long knives' chiefs showered him with gifts and honors, even\r\ntaking him and his wives to Washington City to visit the Great Father,\r\nJames Monroe. He had, in fact, been in the East when Star Arrow had come\r\nto Saukenuk to take White Bear to Victoire.\r\n\r\n\"Why does He Who Moves Alertly say we should not go back to Saukenuk?\"\r\nWhite Bear asked cautiously. He did not want to anger Owl Carver by\r\nsaying so, but he himself was sure that crossing the Great River could\r\nonly lead to calamity.\r\n\r\nOwl Carver said, \"He Who Moves Alertly has always been a friend to the\r\nlong knives, and they treat him as if he was a great chief and give\r\npresents to him. Last summer, when we went to plant corn at Saukenuk, he\r\nwent among Black Hawk's followers and persuaded many of them to flee\r\nback across the river.\" The old shaman smiled at White Bear. \"But now we\r\nhave you, who have also been East and know the ways of the pale eyes.\r\nYou will be able to answer him.\"\r\n\r\n_But all I can say is that he speaks the truth._\r\n\r\nThe words trembled on his lips: _The long knives are more powerful than\r\nyou can imagine. We cannot stand against them._\r\n\r\nAnd yet he did not want to speak. He feared that Owl Carver would think\r\nhim a traitor, as he did He Who Moves Alertly. And, in a way, he felt as\r\nOwl Carver and Black Hawk did. He became angry every time he thought\r\nabout how the tribe had been driven from its homeland.\r\n\r\nOwl Carver puffed on his pipe. \"You will answer He Who Moves Alertly not\r\njust as one who has been among the pale eyes. The day after tomorrow,\r\nyou must go to the cave of the ancestors and seek another vision.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear's heart sank. \"But I am to marry Redbird tomorrow night.\r\nWould you have me leave her the next day to seek a vision?\"\r\n\r\nOwl Carver spread his hands. \"The council starts in three days.\" He\r\ngrinned, showing the space where the tooth had been. \"And it is not as\r\nif you and Redbird have never known the joy of the marriage bed.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear felt his face grow hot, and he lowered his eyes. Since his\r\nreturn they had tried to crowd into a few nights all the pleasures they\r\nhad missed over the last six years.\r\n\r\n\"You will not be gone from her for long,\" Owl Carver said.\r\n\r\n\"But why do you not prophesy?\" White Bear asked. \"You have been the\r\nshaman since long before I was born.\"\r\n\r\nOwl Carver nodded sadly. \"I have tried. It seems the spirits have\r\nnothing to say to me.\"\r\n\r\n_Maybe because you do not want to hear what they say._\r\n\r\nAs he thought about seeking a vision, White Bear began to feel more\r\nhopeful. He might not have to displease Owl Carver and Black Hawk by\r\nspeaking of the strength of the long knives and sounding like He Who\r\nMoves Alertly. Instead, the Turtle, in that sacred cave looking over the\r\nriver, would tell him what he should say. It was sure to be wiser\r\ncounsel than anything he could think of himself.\r\n\r\nHe remembered his boyhood dream of being a prophet for the Sauk. Now he\r\nwould be able to tell them where their future lay.\r\n\r\nBut then he remembered words Owl Carver himself had once spoken to him.\r\nThey had stayed in his memory because they had made him so uneasy.\r\n\r\n_Many times the people do not want to listen to the shaman. The truer\r\nhis words, the less they hear him._\r\n\r\nThe next night White Bear and Redbird sat facing each other on opposite\r\nsides of the wedding fire before Owl Carver's wickiup. White Bear's\r\nfringed shirt and trousers of soft doeskin, worked until it was nearly\r\nwhite, were a gift from a brave whose wife Sun Woman had helped with a\r\ndifficult childbirth.\r\n\r\nRedbird's dress was of white doeskin as well. Around her neck hung the\r\nnecklace of the small, striped megis shells that had belonged to Sun\r\nWoman.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear looked beyond the fire. Hundreds of men and women were\r\nstanding in the shadows watching the ceremony, those of Redbird's Eagle\r\nClan on her side of the fire, the Thunder Clan, kin of Sun Woman and\r\nhimself, on this side. The daughter of the shaman was marrying the son\r\nof a pale eyes father and a medicine woman, and White Bear had returned\r\nfrom a long journey among the pale eyes and was a shaman himself. It was\r\na wedding that people wanted to see.\r\n\r\nWind Bends Grass, standing behind Redbird, spoke of her daughter's\r\ncharacter. Even though she had spent all of her life scolding her,\r\ntonight she extolled her to the skies. She was beautiful, loving,\r\nskilled, obedient. Then Wind Bends Grass instructed Redbird in her\r\nwifely duties, making one small change from the usual speech. Instead of\r\ntelling her to give White Bear sons, she told her to give White Bear\r\n_more_ sons.\r\n\r\nStrangely, at this moment, White Bear found himself thinking of Nancy\r\nHale. Was she still longing for him somewhere across the Great River?\r\n\r\nIf Raoul had not driven him out of Victoire, his promise to Pierre might\r\nhave kept him there. He might never have come back here, not found out\r\ntill much later that he had a son, never have been united with Redbird\r\nas he was tonight. Truly this was coming home. He felt so at peace, he\r\ncould almost be grateful to Raoul.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear was especially honored to have as his wedding sponsor the\r\nThunder Clan's most prominent member--Black Hawk himself.\r\n\r\nBlack Hawk addressed Redbird and her relatives in his harsh, sombre\r\nvoice. \"I have known this young man since he was born. His father, Star\r\nArrow, was a pale eyes, but he was a French pale eyes, and the French\r\nwere always the best friends of the Sauk and Fox, even better than the\r\nBritish. White Bear has been trained in the way of the shaman, and he\r\nhas lived among the pale eyes and learned their secrets as well.\"\r\n\r\n_What have I learned that my people can really use?_ White Bear wondered\r\nruefully. _All I can tell them is that they cannot win a war with the\r\nlong knives._\r\n\r\n\"You must cherish Redbird and protect her,\" Black Hawk said to White\r\nBear. \"You must give her the benefit of your wisdom. Because you\r\nyourself are a shaman, your responsibility to her is all the greater.\"\r\n\r\nThen Owl Carver stood before the fire, between the bride and the groom,\r\nand raised his arms. \"O Earthmaker, bless this man and this woman. May\r\nthey walk with honor on the path they follow as one.\"\r\n\r\nRedbird sang a wedding song to White Bear. Her voice rose clear and pure\r\ninto the night air, and it seemed to White Bear that even the crackling\r\nfire quieted itself to listen.\r\n\r\n    \"I will build a lodge for you,\r\n    I will grind the corn for you.\r\n    I have no home but where you are;\r\n    The trail you walk is also mine.\"\r\n\r\nThen White Bear got up and went around the fire to Redbird. He handed\r\nRedbird a bouquet of pink roses that Sun Woman had carefully collected,\r\ndried and preserved. The orange glow of the fire danced in her black\r\neyes, and White Bear felt an answering love blaze up within himself.\r\n\r\nHe was so much taller than Redbird that he had to bend his knees deeply\r\nso that Redbird could throw her braids over his shoulders, and he heard\r\nsome chuckles and giggles from the watching people. But as her braids\r\nfell lightly on him he thought that he had never in his life been\r\nhappier than at this moment.\r\n\r\nTogether they walked sunwise around the marriage fire, keeping it on\r\ntheir right: and on the east, south, west and north sides White Bear\r\nsaid loudly, \"Redbird is now my wife!\"\r\n\r\nEyes gleamed at him out of the darkness when he came back to the east\r\nside. Standing to the side and just a little behind Black Hawk was Wolf\r\nPaw. White Bear could not resist feeling a little thrill of triumph at\r\nthe realization that he had won Redbird despite the best efforts of this\r\nmighty warrior, this chief's son, this man who owned many horses.\r\n\r\n_Not because I deserve it_, he reminded himself. _Only because Redbird\r\nwould have it so._\r\n\r\n_And now, because she would have it so, we will be together forever._\r\n\r\nOwl Carver bade them depart with the good wishes of the tribe, and\r\nWhite Bear and Redbird walked to the new wickiup they had built on the\r\nedge of the camp. Eagle Feather would live there with them, but tonight\r\nEagle Feather would stay with his grandmother, Sun Woman.\r\n\r\nTonight they would have it to themselves.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNext day, in mid-afternoon, White Bear stood again in the center of the\r\ncamp wearing the same black bearskin he had worn six years ago. Owl\r\nCarver did a shuffling sunwise dance around him, shaking a gourd rattle\r\nand chanting:\r\n\r\n    \"Go forth and dance with the spirits,\r\n    Become a spirit yourself.\r\n    Bring back a gift for the people,\r\n    Bring back the words of the spirits.\"\r\n\r\nBlack Hawk, standing in the circle that had gathered to watch, stared at\r\nhim with an intensity that frightened him. Sun Woman and Redbird stood\r\nwith smiles of quiet pride. This time Redbird need not fear that he\r\nwould freeze to death on his spirit journey.\r\n\r\nIt would be painful to be away from Redbird, he thought, as he looked\r\ninto her eyes, saying a silent good-bye. Now, after a brief feast of\r\nlove, they must go hungry again. But only for a night or two.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear turned his back on the declining sun. The ceremonial bearskin\r\nswung heavily on his head and shoulders as he trotted out of the camp\r\ntoward the trail that ran along the river's edge. As he entered the\r\nwoods, another pair of eyes, hostile, suspicious, caught his. Wolf Paw\r\nagain, standing with folded arms.\r\n\r\n_Wolf Paw still loves Redbird. And hates me._\r\n\r\nHe felt much stronger than he had when he arrived at the camp.\r\nAlternately walking and running, he moved quickly and surely down the\r\nIoway River, and he remembered the way to the bluff of the sacred cave.\r\nSeveral times along the way he met Sauk and Fox warriors. They\r\nrecognized the sacred bearskin, with the bear's skull covering his own\r\nas a partial mask, and stepped aside with eyes averted as he passed\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe sun had sunk behind him by the time he had come to the end of the\r\nalmost-imperceptible trail to the top of the bluff. He stood there a\r\nmoment, looking out across the clear blue sheet of water that was the\r\nGreat River. He stared at the Illinois shore, the rich, flat bottomland\r\nat the river's edge, the wooded bluffs, much like the one he was\r\nstanding on, forming a wall, beyond which rolled the autumn-tan, endless\r\nprairie.\r\n\r\nA beautiful and fertile land, from which his people--and he himself--had\r\nbeen exiled. Would his vision show them a way back?\r\n\r\nHe scrambled down the face of the bluff to the cave and swung into the\r\nentrance.\r\n\r\nIn the shadows he could barely make out Owl Carver's wooden owl standing\r\nover the row of skulls with their stone necklaces; or the white bear\r\nstatue guarding the unknown depths of the cave.\r\n\r\nHe settled himself facing the entrance and chewed some scraps of sacred\r\nmushroom Owl Carver had given him. Nothing to do now but sit and wait.\r\nSurely no watch made by pale eyes could measure the passage of this kind\r\nof time.\r\n\r\nHe heard a scraping and a grumbling from deep in the cave. He felt no\r\nfear now, only a warmth, as at the approach of an old friend. The White\r\nBear, he now understood, was himself in a spirit form.\r\n\r\nThe huge snuffling Bear was at his side, and confidently he rose to step\r\nout of the cave, the Bear accompanying him with its rolling walk. He\r\nstepped on clouds, violet and gold and white and soft as snow under his\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nThe pathway through the sky turned northward. Through breaks in the\r\nclouds he looked down and caught glimpses of the river, a glistening\r\nblue snake. Ahead he could see clouds piling up on clouds, shot through\r\nwith pale, blended rainbow colors, like the ornaments carved from shells\r\ngathered along the eastern sea.\r\n\r\nThen he was inside the cloud tower, peering beyond the Tree of Life at\r\nthe Turtle on his crystal perch. Drop by drop from the Turtle's heart\r\nflowed the waters of the Great River.\r\n\r\n\"What would you ask me, White Bear?\" said the ancient voice like distant\r\nthunder.\r\n\r\n\"Is my father with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your father walks the Trail of Souls far in the West,\" said the Turtle.\r\n\"He will come back to earth soon, and he will be a great teacher of the\r\npeople.\"\r\n\r\n\"Owl Carver and Black Hawk have sent me to ask, should the British Band\r\ngo back to Saukenuk?\"\r\n\r\nThe wrinkled voice said, \"Behold.\"\r\n\r\nThe clouds changed to the walls of a room big enough to hold a Sauk\r\ncamp, where curtained windows alternated with mirrors in gilded frames.\r\nUnder each mirror was a fireplace. Three glittering chandeliers hung\r\nfrom the high ceiling. In the center of a vast flower-patterned carpet\r\nstood Black Hawk.\r\n\r\nTo White Bear's astonishment, Black Hawk was wearing the blue uniform of\r\na long knife, with ropes of gold on his arms and fringes of gold on his\r\nsleeves and shoulders. But he carried no weapons. His face as usual was\r\ngloomy.\r\n\r\nThere were other men in the room, but White Bear could only clearly see\r\none. A pale eyes.\r\n\r\nHe was exceedingly tall and thin; his hair was white, and his bright\r\nblue eyes stared piercingly at Black Hawk. He wore a black cutaway\r\njacket and tight black trousers with shiny black leather shoes; and a\r\nwhite stock, a strip of silk, wound around his throat.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear had seen this man before and recognized him at once.\r\n\r\nHe was known to red men as Sharp Knife--Andrew Jackson, President of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nThe man Raoul had called \"a good old Indian killer.\"\r\n\r\nBlack Hawk was talking, and Sharp Knife was listening. But White Bear\r\ncould not hear what Black Hawk was saying.\r\n\r\nThe room seemed to change. Black Hawk and Sharp Knife disappeared, and\r\nwhere Sharp Knife had been standing there was now another tall, thin\r\nman. He also wore black, but he had a black ribbon at his neck. A black\r\nbeard covered his chin, and the expression on his sun-browned face was\r\none of inconsolable grief. His sadness reminded White Bear of Black\r\nHawk's.\r\n\r\nAll at once White Bear was on a broad field covered with short grass,\r\ndivided by stone walls and wooden fences, with clumps of trees growing\r\nhere and there. Terror clutched his belly as he saw coming at him\r\nthousands of long knives in blue uniforms with rifles and bayonets. He\r\nlooked about frantically for a place to hide, but there was none. He was\r\ncaught in the open.\r\n\r\nBut before the men could reach him they began to die.\r\n\r\nBlood spurted from their blue tunics. They stopped running, staggered\r\nand fell to the ground, dropping their rifles. Faces vanished in bursts\r\nof red vapor. Arms and legs and heads flew through the air. Flashes of\r\nflame and smoke and flying shards of iron tore bodies to bits.\r\n\r\nBut no matter how many of them died, more and more of the white men in\r\ntheir blue jackets and trousers came marching over the horizon holding\r\ntheir bayonets before them. There was no end to them.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear felt as if his heart might stop. He put his hands over his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nAnd when he looked again he was back in the cloudy hall of the Turtle.\r\n\r\n\"What have you shown me?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"I have shown you the future of both the red people and the white people\r\non this island between two oceans,\" the Turtle rumbled. \"It is given to\r\nyou to know two futures because two streams of blood flow in you. You\r\nbelong to both, and to neither.\"\r\n\r\nIt was painful to hear this. The Turtle was uttering thoughts that had\r\noccurred to White Bear many times; he had always tried to put them out\r\nof his mind. Could he not forget his years among the pale eyes and\r\nbecome entirely a Sauk?\r\n\r\nWisps of cloud drifted around the Turtle's scaly body. White Bear heard\r\nthe drip-drip of water from the Turtle's heart into the blue-black,\r\nfish-crowded pool that fed the Great River. The sound was like the\r\nringing of a hammer on an anvil, reverberating through the vast space in\r\nwhich they stood.\r\n\r\nThe Turtle spoke again. \"Earthmaker has willed that the pale eyes shall\r\nfill this world of ours from the eastern sea to the western sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Why?_\" cried White Bear in anguish.\r\n\r\n\"Earthmaker bestows evil as well as good on his children. Sickness and\r\nhunger and death come from Earthmaker, just as strong bodies, and good\r\nthings to eat, and love.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will all Earthmaker's red children die?\"\r\n\r\n\"Great numbers will die, and those who remain will be driven to unkind\r\nlands.\"\r\n\r\n\"What of the Sauk?\" White Bear asked, trembling.\r\n\r\n\"The many who follow Black Hawk across the Great River will be few when\r\nthey cross back.\"\r\n\r\n_Oh, no!_\r\n\r\nThis was what he had come here to learn, but hearing it was like being\r\ncast down from this lodge in the clouds to crash to the earth.\r\n\r\n\"Then the British Band should not go back to Saukenuk?\"\r\n\r\n\"You cannot stop them. For you as for all of my people, this is to be a\r\ntime of testing and pain. I charge you to see that those who hurt my\r\nchildren do not gain from it. You will be the guardian of the land that\r\nhas been placed in your keeping.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I have already lost that land,\" White Bear cried.\r\n\r\nAs if he had not heard White Bear, the Turtle said, \"Know that long\r\nafter all who live now have walked the Trail of Souls, my children will\r\nbe many again, and let the knowing lift up your heart.\" The Turtle\r\ntouched his own claws to the deep crevice in his under-shell from which\r\nthe water perpetually dripped.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear knew it was time to go.\r\n\r\nWhen he awoke in his body he would grieve. He saw nothing but heavy,\r\nunending sorrow ahead for him and for those he loved.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBlack Hawk slowly stood up. A mantle of buffalo fur draped over his\r\nshoulders and a crown of red and black feathers woven into his scalplock\r\nmade him look even bigger and taller than he was.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear sat close to the fire for its heat. The day was cold and\r\novercast, and the damp air around him and the chill ground under him\r\nmade him shiver in the white doeskin shirt he had worn for his wedding.\r\nBecause Owl Carver had asked him, on the band's behalf, to seek a\r\nvision, he could now consider himself fully a shaman. He had costumed\r\nhimself accordingly--three red streaks painted across his forehead,\r\nthree more on each cheekbone, silver disks hanging from his ears, a\r\nthree-strand necklace of megis shells around his neck. Silver clasps on\r\nhis arms and silver bracelets around his wrists. All these things had\r\nbeen supplied by Owl Carver or traded for by Sun Woman. If he had to\r\nspeak he might at least hope his words would be greeted with respect.\r\n\r\nRedbird pressed against him, and her nearness warmed him. Flames danced\r\nover the pile of blackened logs in the center of the British Band's\r\nwinter camp. Light gray smoke rose from the fire, the same color as the\r\nblanket of cloud that hid the afternoon sun.\r\n\r\nFear twisted its knife in White Bear's stomach. He did not want to tell\r\nthis assembly what he knew. Most of them would hate him. The chiefs and\r\nbraves and warriors of the British Band, Black Hawk and all the rest,\r\nwould never forgive him. Owl Carver would feel betrayed.\r\n\r\n_Let them settle this without me._\r\n\r\nBut he knew it was a forlorn hope. When Owl Carver had asked him what he\r\nlearned in his vision, he had answered evasively. And now Owl Carver was\r\ncounting on him.\r\n\r\nAround the fire sat the council of seven chiefs who governed the Sauk\r\nand Fox tribes, including Jumping Fish, Broth and Little Stabbing Chief.\r\nBeside them sat He Who Moves Alertly, the friend of the long knives, the\r\nwar chief who had never made war. Prominent braves like Wolf Paw sat\r\nwith them. The older and the younger shamans of the British Band sat\r\nthere, Owl Carver and White Bear.\r\n\r\nAnd there was another shaman at the fire as well, Flying Cloud, better\r\nknown as the Winnebago Prophet. He was a broad man with a wolfskin\r\nthrown over his shoulders. Unlike nearly all the men of the tribes that\r\nlived along the Great River, he had a thick black mustache that drooped\r\nover the corners of his mouth. A silver nose ring rested on the\r\nmustache. He was head man of a Winnebago village called Prophet's Town,\r\na day's journey up the Rock River from Saukenuk.\r\n\r\nIn the quiet that greeted Black Hawk, White Bear heard, over the crackle\r\nof the fire, the rattle of the war chief's bone bracelets as he held out\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\n\"I only want to go back to the land that belongs to me and dwell there\r\nand raise corn there. I will not be cheated. I will not be driven out.\"\r\n\r\nBlack Hawk did not have a pleasing speaking voice; it was hoarse and\r\ngrating. But the assembly listened intently, because for over twenty\r\nsummers there had been no greater warrior among the Sauk and Fox.\r\n\r\n\"With this hand I have killed seventy and three of the long knives.\r\nEvery Sauk and Fox brave, every Winnebago and Potawatomi and Kickapoo,\r\ncan do as much. Yes, we know the long knives outnumber us. But we can\r\nshow them that if they want to steal Saukenuk from us, they will have to\r\ntrade too many of their young men's lives for it.\r\n\r\n\"Last summer the long knives surrounded us and drove us out of Saukenuk.\r\nBut that was because we were not ready to fight, and some of us were not\r\n_willing_ to fight.\"\r\n\r\nBlack Hawk looked pointedly at He Who Moves Alertly, who sat\r\nexpressionless, as if unaware of Black Hawk's disapproving gaze. His\r\nface was round and ruddy, like the full moon when it first appears\r\nabove the horizon. He wore his glossy black hair long under an\r\nimpressive buffalo headdress with gleaming horns, and had wrapped\r\nhimself in a buffalo-hide robe painted with sunbursts.\r\n\r\nBlack Hawk said, \"Next summer, it will be different. I have had messages\r\nfrom the Winnebago and the Potawatomi promising to help us if the long\r\nknives attack us. The Chippewa, up in the north, say they want to help\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\nA burning log split in two with a noise like a gunshot, and the halves\r\nfell deeper into the fire with a shower of sparks.\r\n\r\nLooking over the heads of those seated near him, White Bear saw columns\r\nof smoke from a dozen or more other campfires rising into the late\r\nafternoon sky. Around those campfires, feasting and gossiping, sat most\r\nof the people of the British Band and their guests from other Sauk and\r\nFox bands, as well as some Winnebago, Potawatomi and Kickapoo braves.\r\nWhat was being decided here now would mean life or death to all who\r\nchose to follow these leaders.\r\n\r\nBlack Hawk said, \"The pale eyes say we sold our land. I say that land\r\ncannot be sold. Earthmaker gives land to those who need it to live on,\r\nto grow food on, to hunt on, as he gives us air and water.\r\n\r\n\"The land has been good to us. It has given us game and fish, fruit and\r\nberries. It has let us grow our squash, beans, pumpkins and corn on it,\r\nand bury our mothers and fathers in it. The pale eyes are destroying the\r\nland, cutting down the trees, fencing off the prairie and plowing it up.\r\nThe land is the mother of us all. When a man's mother is dishonored, he\r\nmust fight. Earthmaker will give us this victory, because he is our\r\nfather and he loves us.\"\r\n\r\nWith a chill that did not come from the air, White Bear remembered the\r\nwords of the Turtle: _Earthmaker bestows evil as well as good on his\r\nchildren._\r\n\r\nWhite Bear prayed his own prayer to Earthmaker: that he not be asked to\r\nspeak to this gathering.\r\n\r\nBlack Hawk lifted his rasping voice in a shout. \"I, Black Hawk, raise\r\nthe war whoop!\"\r\n\r\nHe threw out his chest, lifted his head, and let loose an ululating cry\r\nthat seemed to pierce the very clouds that hung over the camp. Wolf Paw,\r\nIron Knife, Little Crow, Three Horses and a dozen other Sauk and Fox\r\nbraves leaped up, waving rifles, tomahawks, bows and arrows, scalping\r\nknives, screaming their battle cries. Owl Carver beat furiously on a\r\ndrum painted with a picture of the Hawk spirit.\r\n\r\nThe Winnebago Prophet lunged to his feet and joined the outcry, his\r\ngestures so wild and his shouts so loud that he almost seemed to be\r\ncompeting with Black Hawk.\r\n\r\nRedbird spoke softly, close by White Bear's ear. \"They are drunk on\r\nwar.\"\r\n\r\nThe outcry died down. Black Hawk crossed his arms over his chest to show\r\nthat he had finished speaking. The Winnebago Prophet remained standing\r\nand raised his arms.\r\n\r\n\"I have come to promise Black Hawk and his braves that if he goes to\r\nSaukenuk and the long knives attack him, the warriors of Prophet's Town\r\nwill help them to fight back.\"\r\n\r\nThe chiefs and braves seated around the fire greeted this with much\r\nstamping and clapping. White Bear glanced at He Who Moves Alertly, who\r\nsat a quarter of the way around the circle from him. The face under the\r\nbuffalo headdress was as still as if carved from wood.\r\n\r\nFlying Cloud said, \"I have sent messages to all the tribes that live\r\nnear the Great River--Winnebago, Potawatomi, Kickapoo, Piankeshaw,\r\nChippewa. When Black Hawk raises the tomahawk, they will raise the\r\ntomahawk too. And I have had a message from our allies of old, the\r\nBritish in Canada, who say the Americans have done us a great wrong, and\r\nwe should not give up any more land to them. If American long knives\r\nattack us, the British long knives will come to our aid. With ships,\r\nwith big guns, with rifles, powder and shot and food for us, with\r\nhundreds of red-coat soldiers. Now is the best of times to tell the long\r\nknives they cannot push us any further. Let all who are truly men take\r\nto the trail of war with Black Hawk!\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear sensed deadly falsehood in the words of the Winnebago\r\nProphet. When White Bear was in New York City he had heard many times\r\nthat the enmity between Americans and British was a thing of the past.\r\nWhite Bear did not believe that the British up there in Canada had any\r\nintention of getting into a war between whites and Indians in Illinois.\r\nBut how could he prove that what Flying Cloud said was untrue?\r\n\r\nWith a cry of \"Ei! Ei!\" Wolf Paw shook his rifle over his head. He\r\nsnapped it to his shoulder and fired it with a deafening boom and a red\r\nflash and a big cloud of white smoke.\r\n\r\n_Someday he may wish he had not wasted that powder._\r\n\r\nAs White Bear and Redbird sat silently, braves all around them were up\r\nand shrieking, waving rifles and tomahawks, thrusting out arms and legs\r\nin the movements of a war dance. Owl Carver and some of the chiefs\r\nslapped the palms of their hands against the taut, painted deerskin of\r\ntheir drumheads.\r\n\r\nA few other men did not join the shouts of approval, among them the\r\nround-faced He Who Moves Alertly.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear sat with his fists clenched in his lap, wondering whether\r\nanyone would notice that the youngest of the three shamans among them\r\nwas not shouting for war. He felt Redbird's hand grip his arm tightly,\r\nhelping him to feel stronger.\r\n\r\nOnly to Redbird had White Bear told all of his vision. She shared his\r\nfear that if the British Band followed Black Hawk to war they would be\r\ndestroyed, and she had insisted on sitting with him at the council fire.\r\nWhite Bear knew it was not the custom for a wife to sit with her husband\r\nat a council, but she had argued and pleaded until he had given in and\r\nbrought her with him.\r\n\r\nHer presence beside him both comforted him and made him uneasy. Owl\r\nCarver, when he came to the fire, had stared at his daughter, frowned\r\nand looked away. Wolf Paw had eyed them and smiled scornfully.\r\n\r\nAs the tumult inspired by the Winnebago Prophet quieted down, He Who\r\nMoves Alertly looked around the circle of chiefs and braves, his eyes\r\npausing at anyone who had not joined the outcry for war. His gaze met\r\nWhite Bear's for an instant, and he nodded almost imperceptibly. White\r\nBear had an eerie feeling that He Who Moves Alertly knew what was in his\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nThe chief who favored the long knives stood up.\r\n\r\nA sullen muttering spread through the men around the council fire. Most\r\nof those who agreed with He Who Moves Alertly had stayed away from this\r\ncouncil. White Bear felt admiration for anyone who could look so\r\nconfident, standing before a crowd in which so many were against him.\r\n\r\n\"War is loud, and peace is quiet,\" He Who Moves Alertly began. \"But\r\npeace keeps us alive. The real way to defeat the long knives is to stay\r\nalive.\"\r\n\r\nHis voice was deep and pleasant, and he smiled as if every man there\r\nwere his friend.\r\n\r\n\"When is it right for a brave to go to war? When he must avenge himself\r\non those who have done wrong to him. Black Hawk says we should fight\r\nthe pale eyes because they have stolen land from us. But I have seen the\r\npapers with the marks of our chiefs on them. Seven different times Sauk\r\nand Fox chiefs have made their marks on papers agreeing to give up all\r\nclaim to the land east of the Great River. The long knives say our\r\nchiefs were paid in gold for the land.\"\r\n\r\nAs his benign gaze swept the assembly, he said, \"It is right for a brave\r\nto go to war when he is strong enough to make war. He does not go\r\nbecause he wants to be killed, because he wants to leave his women and\r\nchildren unprotected. He knows he may die, but he does not look for\r\ndeath.\"\r\n\r\nHe Who Moves Alertly was no longer smiling. He touched his fingertips to\r\nhis eyes, then raised his arms to the sky. \"May Earthmaker strike me\r\nblind if I do not speak the truth.\r\n\r\n\"We are not strong enough to make war on the long knives. I have\r\ntraveled in the lands of the Americans, all the way to the eastern sea.\r\nI have seen so many long knives that I could not count them all.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear felt more and more uneasy as he listened. Black Hawk and all\r\nthe other braves of the British Band looked on He Who Moves Alertly as\r\nan enemy. But White Bear knew that the chief in the buffalo headdress\r\nwas speaking the truth. Perhaps not about the treaties, but surely about\r\nthe vast numbers of long knives.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear saw again the thousands of blue-uniformed soldiers he had\r\nseen marching in New York on the Fourth of July a year ago, and the\r\nother thousands he had seen in his vision, fighting and dying but still\r\nadvancing on some strange battlefield.\r\n\r\nHe Who Moves Alertly said, \"Owl Carver and Black Hawk say the Potawatomi\r\nand Winnebago will aid the British Band, and other tribes from farther\r\naway. I say none of them will help. This quarrel over Saukenuk is not\r\ntheir quarrel, and they have made their own peace with the long knives.\r\n\r\n\"The Winnebago Prophet says the British will send us guns and\r\nammunition, even men. I say this is foolish talk. You call yourselves\r\nthe British Band, and think the British are your great friends. Many\r\nsummers ago, yes, the British were at war with the Americans and got\r\nSauk and Fox and many other tribes to help them. But when that war was\r\nover, our people gained nothing and lost much. Many tribes had to give\r\nup land to pay for fighting on the British side. Now the British do not\r\ncare about us. The British pale eyes and the American pale eyes are at\r\npeace.\r\n\r\n\"I say to those who will listen to me--come with me. I will lead you\r\ndeep into this Ioway country, where there will be no pale eyes farmers\r\nto bother us. Their Great Father will show his gratitude to those who do\r\nnot fight them. He will give us money and food and help us find good\r\nland. We will live!\r\n\r\n\"For those who follow Black Hawk, I grieve. They will not live.\"\r\n\r\nHe Who Moves Alertly's closing words rang. He crossed his hands over his\r\nchest and sat down amidst a silence touched by the crackling of the\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear heard in his mind the rumbling voice: _The many who follow\r\nBlack Hawk across the Great River will be few when they cross back._ He\r\ntrembled inwardly.\r\n\r\nThe clouds overhead had broken up, and the rays of the sun, about to\r\nset, fell upon many faces full of anger and contempt. But White Bear\r\nalso saw lips pursed in thought, eyes lowered.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear could find little wrong with what He Who Moves Alertly said,\r\nbut he did not like the way it pointed. To admit that the long knives\r\ncould do whatever they wanted to the Sauk, to hope like little children\r\nthat if they obeyed the Great Father in Washington City he would be kind\r\nto the Sauk and give gifts of food, clothing and shelter--was that not\r\nmerely a slower kind of death?\r\n\r\nHe Who Moves Alertly did not seem to see that if the Sauk let the whites\r\npush them westward, there would be no end to it. Eventually the pale\r\neyes would take all the land there was.\r\n\r\n_To drive a people from their home is to make them prey to hunger,\r\ndisease, enemy tribes. It is to destroy them, even if not a single shot\r\nis fired._\r\n\r\n_If we must die, would it not be better to avenge ourselves on the pale\r\neyes for their cruelty to us? Is it not better to die with pride than to\r\njust give up our good hunting and farming lands and go meekly into the\r\ndesert?_\r\n\r\nHe felt Redbird press against him. He had a sudden, strong feeling that\r\nthey should follow He Who Moves Alertly farther into the Ioway country.\r\nThat way they would surely live. How could he, White Bear, demand or\r\npermit that his wife and son endure the sufferings and the danger those\r\nwho followed Black Hawk would face?\r\n\r\nBut at the thought of deserting the British Band he felt an unbearable\r\nanguish. One winter long ago he had found a trap that had been sprung.\r\nIn the trap was the rear paw and part of the leg of a raccoon, ending in\r\na bloody mass. The animal had chewed its own leg off to escape. He had\r\nseen a trail of blood leading into the woods. The raccoon had limped off\r\nto die, but to die free.\r\n\r\nWhat He Who Moves Alertly offered was a trap. What Black Hawk offered\r\nwas freedom, but with it the prospect of death.\r\n\r\nHe and Redbird could pack their belongings and leave after this council\r\nwas over. White Bear was sure other families would be doing that.\r\n\r\nBut could he turn his back on Black Hawk, who had just spoken for him at\r\nhis marriage, on Owl Carver, the father of his wife? On Sun Woman, who\r\nhe was sure would stay with the British Band? On the people who had been\r\npart of his life as far back as he could remember?\r\n\r\nStaying meant facing the long knives' guns. It meant starvation. It\r\nmeant pain. Those who whooped for Black Hawk tonight did not see that.\r\nOr maybe they did see it but still embraced it. To see it clearly and\r\naccept it, not only for himself but for Redbird and Eagle Feather, hurt\r\nlike biting off one of his own limbs. But he would not abandon his\r\npeople. He had run away from his last fight over land. He would not run\r\naway from this one.\r\n\r\nOwl Carver, holding up his owl-headed medicine stick with its red\r\nfeathers, stood before the council fire. \"He Who Moves Alertly thinks he\r\nis the only one who knows the Americans. But one of our own British Band\r\nhas been to the big towns in the East. And he is a shaman to whom the\r\nTurtle has given special visions. I ask White Bear to tell us what he\r\nhas seen.\"\r\n\r\nAt the sound of his name, White Bear felt a coldness spread upward from\r\nthe base of his spine. He saw the look of earnest invitation on Owl\r\nCarver's face, he saw Black Hawk's expectancy. He would as soon spit at\r\nthese two men he respected so much as disappoint them deeply. But now he\r\nmust.\r\n\r\nRedbird's fingers dug into his arm. Her slanting eyes were wide.\r\n\r\n\"Speak truly,\" she whispered.\r\n\r\nSlowly he stood up. It hurt to pull his arm from Redbird's grip, as if\r\nhe was stripping his own skin from his arm. His eyes momentarily met\r\nthose of He Who Moves Alertly, who stared at him intently.\r\n\r\nAs Owl Carver had, he raised the medicine stick he had cut for himself\r\nafter his first vision, decorated with a single string of red and white\r\nbeads. He held it up uncertainly. He hoped his shaman's adornments, the\r\npaint, the earrings, necklaces and bracelets, would impress them.\r\n\r\nHe was prepared in another way, as well. He had never spoken before the\r\nleaders of his band; but at St. George's School each boy was required to\r\ngive a short speech to the members of his class once a week and a longer\r\none before the whole school twice a year. Those speeches had to be\r\nwritten and memorized, and now White Bear must speak as the spirit moved\r\nhim. But he knew how to stand, how to project his voice, how to measure\r\nhis words. In his heart he thanked Mr. Winans for teaching him all that.\r\n\r\n\"The big American towns in the East are bigger than the biggest towns\r\never built by any red men,\" he began. \"In those villages the pale eyes\r\nswarm like bees in a honey tree.\r\n\r\n\"Every summer the Americans have a great feast to celebrate the day they\r\ntold the Great Father of the British that they would no longer be his\r\nchildren. One summer in a big town called New York I saw long knives\r\nwalk in long lines to honor this big day. Each man had a new rifle.\r\nEight at a time walked side by side, and it would take half a day to go\r\nfrom one end of their line to the other. Then came more long knives on\r\nhorseback, as many as a herd of buffalo. And after them horses pulled\r\nbig thunder guns on wheels that shoot iron balls the size of a man's\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n\"The long knives were led by their Great Father, Sharp Knife, who was\r\nvisiting New York. He is very thin, with a cruel face and white hair. He\r\nsits straight on his horse and wears a long knife at his belt.\r\n\r\n\"After all those long knives had walked through the town they came to an\r\nopen field, where they fired off all their thunder guns. The noise made\r\nthe earth tremble.\"\r\n\r\nAllowing his legs and hands to shake also, as they demanded to do, White\r\nBear paused and let his gaze travel over the faces in the big circle\r\naround the fire.\r\n\r\nThe red glow of the setting sun fell on the faintly smiling He Who Moves\r\nAlertly. Black Hawk's back was to the sun, his face in shadow. Redbird\r\nlooked up at White Bear, eyes bright and full of love. Others might hate\r\nwhat he said, but he was glad that Redbird heard how well and truly he\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\nAngry words hissed and sputtered like the burning logs. White Bear saw\r\nWolf Paw poke Little Crow, one of the leading braves, who was seated\r\nbeside him, and speak to him with muted voice but urgent gestures. The\r\nbrave got up and left the fire.\r\n\r\nOwl Carver, seated beside Black Hawk, lifted his head. White Bear saw\r\nbewilderment on his teacher's face, and shrank within himself at the\r\nsight.\r\n\r\nOwl Carver said, \"White Bear is both pale eyes and Sauk. So far he\r\nspeaks to us only with the pale eyes half of his head. Let White Bear\r\ntell us what vision the Turtle has given him.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear felt a small surge of hope. What he had seen as a traveler\r\namong the pale eyes might not discourage the British Band from making\r\nwar, but his vision might move them more.\r\n\r\n\"The Turtle showed me Black Hawk talking to Sharp Knife,\" he said,\r\npointing to the war chief, who lifted his feather-crowned head at the\r\nsound of his name. \"They were in the house of the Great Father of the\r\nAmericans in the village called Washington City.\"\r\n\r\nHe heard amazed murmurings all around him. Encouraged, he went on.\r\n\r\n\"Then I saw great numbers of long knives running toward me over a field.\r\nThey were shooting and being shot at. I saw many of them hit, and they\r\nfell and died, but they kept coming on. I saw a tall, thin man with a\r\nbeard, a sad man whom I have never seen before, mourning over the fallen\r\nlong knives.\"\r\n\r\nThe sun had gone down. Now he could see the dark listening faces only by\r\nthe yellow glow of the fire.\r\n\r\nOwl Carver said, \"White Bear's vision brings us hope. He sees our own\r\nBlack Hawk meeting with Sharp Knife in Sharp Knife's house. Black Hawk\r\nwill go to Sharp Knife's very house to lay down peace terms to the\r\nAmericans.\"\r\n\r\n_That is not what it means!_ White Bear thought, shocked.\r\n\r\nOwl Carver went on. \"White Bear saw long knives dying. White Bear's\r\nvision foretells victory for the British Band.\"\r\n\r\nFrom all around the campfire he heard grunts of approval at Owl Carver's\r\nwords. White Bear's heart felt lost and sinking, like a stone thrown\r\ninto the Great River.\r\n\r\n\"Listen!\" he cried. \"Owl Carver is my father in spirit, but he did not\r\nsee this vision or feel its sadness. I did. I stood there before the\r\nTurtle, and I know that what he showed me was a warning. If the British\r\nBand takes to the path of war, Black Hawk will be Sharp Knife's\r\nprisoner.\"\r\n\r\nShouts of protest erupted around him. He saw Little Crow come back to\r\nthe fire with a bundle of bright red and blue cloth in his hands.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear spoke on over the outcry. \"Listen! When I saw the long knives\r\ndying, more and more of them came forward, and their numbers were\r\nendless. They were not fighting our warriors. They were fighting other\r\nlong knives. The vision said that there would be many, many long knives\r\nin summers and winters to come, so many that they would fight each\r\nother.\"\r\n\r\nOwl Carver said in a voice just loud enough for White Bear to hear, \"Say\r\nno more. You do great harm.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must say more. You have asked me to speak. Now I must tell what I\r\nknow. You must listen. The Turtle also spoke to me. He said, 'The many\r\nwho follow Black Hawk across the Great River will be few when they cross\r\nback.'\"\r\n\r\nAfter a moment's hesitation Owl Carver lifted his hands. \"They will be\r\nfew because we will win back our land on the other side and stay there.\"\r\n\r\nBefore White Bear could answer, Black Hawk stood up, his face in the\r\nfirelight a mask of wrath. White Bear trembled.\r\n\r\n\"Black Hawk will never be Sharp Knife's prisoner!\" the war chief roared.\r\n\"Black Hawk will die first.\"\r\n\r\nSomeone else was standing up before the fire. A woman.\r\n\r\nRedbird.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear felt himself trapped in a nightmare. Had his wife gone mad?\r\nShe could not speak to a council of chiefs and braves. His heart beating\r\nfuriously, he reached out to silence her. But she was already speaking.\r\n\r\n\"You are fools if you do not listen to White Bear,\" she cried. \"He is\r\ngifted with the power of prophecy.\" She turned to Owl Carver. \"My\r\nfather, you know that the whole tribe crosses the river from east to\r\nwest every year for the winter hunt. If the Turtle says few will cross\r\nback over the Great River, he means the rest of us will be dead.\"\r\n\r\nHer words were greeted not with anger but with shouts of scornful\r\nlaughter. White Bear knew that the chiefs and braves did not care what\r\nshe said; they were merely amused that a woman dared try to speak to\r\nthem at all. He burned with shame for himself and Redbird.\r\n\r\nBeyond the circle of firelight he saw the shadows of men and women\r\nstanding in the twilight. Word of the dispute at the council fire must\r\nbe spreading through the camp and drawing more people to hear, perhaps\r\nto speak their own minds, as was their right. He glimpsed Sun Woman\r\nhurrying toward him, picking her way through the seated men.\r\n\r\nWolf Paw strode toward White Bear, holding in his hands the bundle of\r\nred and blue cloth Little Crow had brought him. He glared at Redbird.\r\n\r\n\"It is bad medicine for women to speak to the council.\"\r\n\r\nRedbird stepped in front of White Bear to face Wolf Paw. \"A medicine\r\nwoman tells you: the words of White Bear are _good_ medicine.\"\r\n\r\n\"How can White Bear tell the British Band what to do when he cannot make\r\nhis wife behave as a woman should?\" Wolf Paw said. \"Sit down, Redbird.\"\r\nAnd he pushed her aside.\r\n\r\nRage shot White Bear forward like an arrow from a bow, arms outstretched\r\nto grapple with Wolf Paw. He lifted his medicine stick as if to strike\r\nat the red-crested brave.\r\n\r\nHands gripped his arms. He struggled, blind with fury, flailing his arms\r\nand kicking. Wolf Paw, his teeth bared, wrenched the medicine stick from\r\nWhite Bear's hand.\r\n\r\n\"Do not harm the medicine stick!\" shouted Owl Carver.\r\n\r\nWithout looking at the old shaman, Wolf Paw handed him White Bear's\r\nmedicine stick. Two big warriors held White Bear as Wolf Paw approached\r\nhim, stretching his lips in a grin.\r\n\r\n\"A woman speaks for peace with the pale eyes,\" Wolf Paw said, \"because\r\npeace is women's way. I once saw Redbird going to White Bear when he was\r\non his vision quest. Maybe he gets his visions from her.\"\r\n\r\nMore and more men were on their feet, and they roared with laughter at\r\nWolf Paw's gibe.\r\n\r\nSun Woman had made her way into the inner ring around the fire and now\r\nheld Redbird.\r\n\r\n\"Come away, daughter,\" she said in a strong but soothing voice. \"This\r\ndoes not help White Bear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look!\" shouted Wolf Paw. \"Now he has both his wife and his mother at\r\nthe council fire.\"\r\n\r\nHe shook out the red and blue cloth. It was a woman's dress.\r\n\r\n\"He speaks like a woman,\" Wolf Paw said. \"He says what women tell him to\r\nsay. Women speak for him. Let him dress like a woman. A pale eyes\r\nwoman.\"\r\n\r\nWolf Paw flung the dress over White Bear's head, and the two men who\r\nheld him pulled it down around him. White Bear felt wrapped in\r\nhopelessness as the cloth covered his head.\r\n\r\nAnd he had wanted to be a prophet for the Sauk.\r\n\r\n_The truer his words, the less they hear him._\r\n\r\nHe struggled halfheartedly. He no longer cared what they did to him. His\r\nown failure and the sure destruction of his people chained him so that\r\nhe could barely move. The warriors pulled the dress straight down over\r\nhis arms, pinioning them to his sides. As his head emerged through the\r\ncollar, laughter battered at him. Teeth gleamed in the firelight.\r\n\r\nHe saw Sun Woman holding Redbird. Tears squeezed through his wife's\r\ntightly shut eyelids. The face of his mother was heavy with woe.\r\n\r\nToo despairing to resist, he let Wolf Paw and his men push and drag him\r\naway from the council fire and run him through the camp. He was blind to\r\nthe laughing faces around him, deaf to the mocking cries.\r\n\r\nBut he saw one sight that all but killed him--looking up at him from\r\nsomewhere in the crowd, the hurt, bewildered eyes of his son, Eagle\r\nFeather.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13\r\n\r\nThe Volunteers\r\n\r\n\r\nNicole and Frank had walked halfway across the main room of the trading\r\npost blockhouse when Nicole heard Raoul's voice thundering from the\r\nstone-walled counting office in the far corner.\r\n\r\n\"You and the boys will stay at Victoire!\"\r\n\r\nNicole touched Frank's arm, and they stopped and drew back a little,\r\nstanding beside the long black barrel of the six-pounder naval cannon\r\nRaoul had set up in the blockhouse. It would be best not to intrude on\r\nRaoul when he was in the midst of a quarrel.\r\n\r\n\"But none of them French people there like me,\" a woman answered, high,\r\nnasal, with a Missouri twang. \"It's downright lonesome.\" Nicole\r\nrecognized Clarissa Greenglove's voice.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to be gone and your father's coming with me. Where the hell\r\nelse would you stay?\"\r\n\r\n\"With my Aunt Melinda in St. Louis. That'd be a perfect place. You could\r\nsend me down on the _Victory_.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I could.\" Raoul's voice was creamy with sarcasm. \"And then do\r\nyou know what would happen? Half those men who are out in the courtyard\r\nnow volunteering for my militia company would quit. Because if I send\r\nyou and Phil and Andy away, it means _their_ families aren't safe. And\r\nso they'd insist on staying home to protect them.\"\r\n\r\nHis voice rose to a shout. \"Do you understand now, goddamn it? Then get\r\nthe hell out of here.\"\r\n\r\nA moment later Clarissa scurried out past the iron-reinforced door of\r\nRaoul's counting room. The two small boys she'd borne to Raoul ran\r\nbeside her floor-length calico skirt. She'd gotten to be\r\nround-shouldered, Nicole saw.\r\n\r\nClarissa nodded. \"Mister, Miz Hopkins.\"\r\n\r\n\"Morning, Clarissa,\" said Nicole. To call her by her first name felt not\r\nquite respectful, but to call her \"Miss Greenglove,\" especially with her\r\ntwo sons right there with her, seemed cruel.\r\n\r\nClarissa gave Nicole a woebegone look that seemed to be asking for\r\nsomething--Nicole wasn't quite sure what. Then she ducked her head, and\r\nher bonnet hid her eyes.\r\n\r\nPhil, the five-year-old, looked up at Nicole. He had very light blond\r\nhair, almost silver, and large eyes that seemed set deep in his pale,\r\nthin face. A little ghost.\r\n\r\n\"My dad's gonna fight Injuns.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's fine.\" Nicole didn't know what else to say. Clarissa, who had\r\ntaken a few steps ahead, reached back and jerked Phil's arm so hard that\r\nhe hollered.\r\n\r\nRaoul, when they entered his office, seemed unperturbed by his argument\r\nwith Clarissa. But his eyes widened and flashed with momentary anger\r\nwhen he saw Nicole. Then he grinned, teeth white under his black\r\nmustache.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Nicole and Frank. Come to lay your hatchets to rest? Now that the\r\nIndians are waving theirs around?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's why we're here, Raoul,\" said Frank.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, I've read your paragraphs in the _Visitor_,\" said Raoul, one side\r\nof his mouth twisted up in a contemptuous smile. \"Seems you'd just love\r\nto give Illinois back to the Indians.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing of the kind,\" Frank said gruffly.\r\n\r\nHow unfair, Nicole thought. Frank had written only that if the 1804 land\r\nagreement had been obtained through fraud, it would be better to\r\nnegotiate a new treaty with the Sauk and Fox rather than meet them with\r\narmed force.\r\n\r\nRaoul's tanned face reddened and his nostrils flared. \"Give back\r\nIllinois,\" he persisted, \"just like you wanted to give Victoire to\r\nPierre's mongrel bastard.\"\r\n\r\nNicole saw not a trace of guilt on that broad, hard face over what he\r\nhad done to Auguste. She clenched her fists. She must try to contain her\r\nanger.\r\n\r\nFrank spoke. \"Don't bring up Auguste now, Raoul. He's what divides us,\r\nand we oughtn't to be divided now. We want to talk to you about\r\nprotecting Victor.\"\r\n\r\nHeat lightning flickered in Raoul's eyes, shifting quickly to a derisive\r\ngleam. \"Well, that should be easy, Frank, with your attitude. You can\r\nmake a white flag out of any bedsheet.\"\r\n\r\nNicole thought, _He's just using our coming here as an opportunity to\r\nrub our faces in the dirt_.\r\n\r\n\"Don't make this so hard for us, Raoul,\" she said. \"We need each other.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really? What do I need you for?\" His eyes were cold.\r\n\r\nMany answers crowded Nicole's mind, but she thought for a moment before\r\nspeaking.\r\n\r\n\"You need the people of this town to make a success of the estate, now\r\nyou've taken it over, your orchards and farms, your shipping line, your\r\ntrading ventures. Most of the people who live in Victor work for you,\r\ndirectly or indirectly. And you're leaving them unprotected.\"\r\n\r\nBefore Raoul could answer, Frank joined in. \"From what I've seen, you\r\nplan to march every man who knows how to shoot a rifle away from here to\r\nfight the Indians down by the Rock River. If you take all the fighting\r\nmen away, who's going to defend Victor and Victoire?\"\r\n\r\nRaoul threw back his head and roared with laughter. \"God, I can't\r\nbelieve I'm hearing you right. Ever since last fall you've wished I\r\nwould disappear from the face of the earth. Now you come to me begging\r\nfor protection.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's not for ourselves that we're asking,\" said Nicole. \"We just want\r\nyou to leave enough men behind to defend the women and children and\r\nnoncombatants who stay here.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul's eyes narrowed and fixed on Frank. \"Noncombatants like you,\r\nFrank? You won't pick up a rifle yourself, but you want some of my men\r\nto stay and guard you.\"\r\n\r\nFrank looked back steadily. \"I'm learning to shoot. Your father is\r\nteaching me.\" Nicole felt a rush of love for Frank, and pride in his\r\nwillingness to learn to do something he hated, because he had to.\r\n\r\nRaoul spread his hands. \"Good for you, and good for Papa.\" He looked\r\ndown, and his face reddened slightly. When he looked up, his dark eyes\r\nmet Nicole's.\r\n\r\n\"How is Papa?\"\r\n\r\nNicole checked the urge to remind him that he had nearly killed their\r\nfather, and said, \"He's tolerably well. The little house Frank has been\r\nbuilding for him is finished. And he's able to walk. Guichard takes care\r\nof him.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul clapped his hands together. \"Good, good! Then that's two riflemen\r\nyou've got right there. And I'll bet old Guichard could even shoot if it\r\ncame to that. And you'll have David Cooper, he's a veteran of 'Twelve.\r\nHe's going to keep an eye on the trading post for me, along with Burke\r\nRussell. I'm sure there'll be a few others. As for the rest of the men,\r\nif I didn't lead them down to the Rock River, they'd go anyway. They're\r\nraring to hunt redskins.\"\r\n\r\nNicole recalled the line of men she had seen just now in the trading\r\npost courtyard signing up for the Smith County volunteer militia. There\r\nmust have been over a hundred of them, some wearing coonskin caps and\r\nfringed buckskins, others with straw hats, calico shirts and tow-linen\r\npantaloons, two dozen or so sporting the head kerchiefs favored by men\r\nof French descent. They'd been in high spirits, laughing and talking\r\nabout bringing back scalps.\r\n\r\nFrank said, \"Of course you don't _want_ to think there'll be an Indian\r\nattack on Victor while you're gone. What you want is to go down to the\r\nRock River country with the militia and win a great victory over the\r\nIndians. Or something you can call a great victory.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul held out his hands. \"Frank, you printed Reynolds's proclamation in\r\nyour damned paper.\"\r\n\r\nHe pointed over his shoulder, where a copy of the Illinois governor's\r\ncall to arms, cut from the _Victor Visitor_ for April 17, 1832, was\r\nnailed to the wall. Nicole's eyes traveled over the opening lines.\r\n\r\n                            FELLOW CITIZENS\r\n\r\n    Your country requires your services. The Indians have assumed a\r\n    hostile attitude and have invaded the State in violation of the\r\n    treaty of last summer.\r\n\r\n    The British Band of Sauks and other hostile Indians, headed by Black\r\n    Hawk, are in possession of the Rock River country, to the great\r\n    terror of the frontier inhabitants. I consider the settlers on the\r\n    frontiers to be in imminent danger ...\r\n\r\nRaoul said, \"He doesn't say stay home and defend your town. He says\r\nrendezvous at Beardstown. That is a lot closer to Black Hawk than it is\r\nto Victor.\"\r\n\r\nFrank said, \"That proclamation is for towns that are in safe territory.\r\nWe're the settlers _on_ the frontier, the ones Reynolds says are in\r\ndanger. I was talking yesterday to a man from Galena, Raoul. Up there,\r\nthe volunteers have formed a militia company, but they're going to stay\r\nright where they are, in case of Indian attack. We aren't _expected_ to\r\nsupply troops to chase Black Hawk.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul shook his head. \"We've got to hit Black Hawk hard and fast with\r\nall the men we can muster. Once we do, there'll be no danger to Victor.\"\r\n\r\nFrank said, \"If something like what happened at Fort Dearborn happens\r\nhere at Victor, innocent people will pay for your decision. You want\r\nthat on your conscience?\"\r\n\r\nAt the mention of Fort Dearborn, Raoul's face had gone expressionless.\r\nHe sat there and stared at Frank for a moment, then stood up abruptly.\r\n\r\n\"My conscience is clear,\" he said.\r\n\r\n_You have no conscience_, Nicole thought. She stared sadly into the\r\nbright blue eyes that looked so blankly at her now, and wondered where\r\nher smiling little brother had gone, so many years ago. The smile still\r\ncame readily to his face; but now it only mocked and taunted. Did those\r\nyears of captivity with the Indians fully explain Raoul, or was he a\r\nthrowback to some robber-baron ancestor whose only law was the sword?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"When a man goes off to war, Miss Nancy, it means the world to him to\r\nknow he has someone to come home to.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul smiled down from his chestnut stallion, Banner, at Nancy Hale in\r\nthe driver's seat of her black buggy. At nineteen, she was a woman in\r\nfull bloom. She'd probably have married a long time ago if she'd stayed\r\nback East. There were a lot of men out here on the frontier, but few\r\ngood enough to court a woman like her.\r\n\r\n_She'd be a fool not to take my offer seriously. It's the best one\r\nshe'll ever get._\r\n\r\nNancy looked first at the dusty road over the grass-covered hills\r\nbetween Victoire and Victor, the morning sun beating down on it, then up\r\nat him. The deep blue of her eyes was a marvel.\r\n\r\n\"You already have someone to come home to, Mr. de Marion. And children.\"\r\n\r\nChildren, yes, but the mingling of his de Marion blood with the\r\nnondescript Greenglove line could hardly produce the children he wanted.\r\nNancy, on the other hand, from an old New England family that probably\r\nwent back to even better English stock, was just the sort of woman he\r\nwanted to breed with.\r\n\r\n\"Clarissa and I have never stood up before a priest or a minister, Miss\r\nHale. I've just been passing my time with her until the right lady came\r\nalong.\"\r\n\r\nHer gaze was cool and level. \"As far as I'm concerned you're as good as\r\nmarried, and you have no right to be talking to me this way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Necessity makes your bedfellows out here on the frontier.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not mine.\" She shook her head, blond braids swinging. He could picture\r\nall that honey-gold hair spread out on a pillow, and he felt a pulse\r\nbeat in his throat.\r\n\r\nNancy went on, \"You must know how wrong it is for you to speak to me\r\nthis way. Otherwise you wouldn't have ambushed me out here.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've waited days for a chance to speak to you in private.\"\r\n\r\nJosiah Hode, Hodge Hode's boy, had ridden fast to the trading post this\r\nmorning to tell Raoul that Miss Hale was driving her buggy into town and\r\nwas traveling, for once, without her father. It was the news Raoul had\r\nbeen hoping for ever since the governor's proclamation had arrived in\r\nVictor. Knowing Miss Nancy was indignant over his treatment of the\r\nmongrel, Raoul had delayed approaching her. Now he could delay no\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\n\"I leave with the militia next Monday,\" he said. \"That gives you three\r\ndays to think it over. I hope to carry your favorable answer with me\r\nwhen I ride off to defend you from the savages.\"\r\n\r\nShe smiled, but the smile was without humor or warmth. \"Carry this\r\nanswer with you if you wish: No.\" She flicked the reins, and her dappled\r\ngray horse speeded up to a trot.\r\n\r\nRaoul spurred his own horse to keep pace with her. \"Take time to\r\nconsider.\"\r\n\r\n\"The answer will always be no.\"\r\n\r\nWhite-hot anger exploded within him. His fists clenched on Banner's\r\nreins.\r\n\r\n\"You'll end up an old maid schoolmarm!\" he shouted. \"You'll never know\r\nwhat it is to have a man between your legs.\"\r\n\r\nHer face went white. He had hurt her, and that made him feel better.\r\n\r\nHe kicked his heels hard into Banner's sides and the stallion uttered an\r\nangry whicker and broke into a gallop, leaving Nancy Hale and her buggy\r\nenveloped in dust.\r\n\r\nHe wished the country around here weren't so damned open. If he could\r\nhave dragged her out of that buggy and into the woods, given her a taste\r\nof the real thing, she'd have changed her mind about him.\r\n\r\n_Is she still pining for the mongrel?_\r\n\r\nWell, he thought, as the gray log walls of the trading post came into\r\nsight around a bend in the ridge road, he _would_ carry her answer to\r\nthe war. And the Indians would suffer the more for it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nProphet's Town was deserted. Black Hawk and his allies had fled.\r\n\r\nRaoul reined up Banner in the very center of the rings of dark, silent\r\nIndian houses. Armand Perrault, Levi Pope, Hodge Hode and Otto Wegner\r\nstopped beside him. He did not know whether he was relieved or\r\ndisappointed. His cap-and-ball pistol drawn, the hammer pulled back, he\r\ndrew angry breaths and glared about him. He felt exposed, realizing that\r\nat any time an arrow aimed at his heart could come winging out of one of\r\nthose long loaf-shaped bark and frame Winnebago lodges.\r\n\r\nBecause of Raoul's experience in the skirmishing around Saukenuk last\r\nyear, General Henry Atkinson had commissioned him a colonel and put him\r\nin command of the advance guard, known as the spy battalion. He enjoyed\r\nthe prestige of leading the spies, but he felt a constant tightness in\r\nhis belly.\r\n\r\nHe reached down for the canteen in the Indian blanketwork bag strapped\r\nto his saddle, uncorked it and took a quick swallow of Old Kaintuck. It\r\nwent down hot and spread warmth from his stomach through his whole body.\r\nHe cooled his throat with water from a second canteen.\r\n\r\nFor three weeks now, slowed by heavy spring rains that swelled creeks to\r\nnearly impassable torrents, the militia had followed Black Hawk's trail\r\nup the Rock River. To the whites' disappointment, the Indians had\r\nbypassed Saukenuk, doubtless aware that the militia had come out against\r\nthem. Instead, Black Hawk's band had trekked twenty-five miles upriver,\r\nreportedly stopping at Prophet's Town. Now, they were not here either.\r\n\r\nRaoul hated the Indian village on sight. Built on land that sloped\r\ngently down to the south bank of the Rock River, it surrounded him,\r\nthreatened him, lay dark, sullen and sinister under a gray sky heavy\r\nwith rain. It reminded him too vividly of the redskin villages where\r\nhe'd spent those two worst years of his life.\r\n\r\nHe saw no cooking fires, no drying meat or stacks of vegetables by the\r\ndark doorways, no poles flaunting feathers, ribbons and enemy scalps.\r\nThat characteristic odor of Indian towns, a mixture of tobacco smoke and\r\ncooking hominy, hung in the air but was very faint. He figured the\r\nIndians had left here days ago.\r\n\r\n\"Otto,\" Raoul said, \"ride back to General Atkinson and report the enemy\r\nhas abandoned Prophet's Town.\"\r\n\r\nWegner gave Raoul a strenuous Prussian salute, pulled his spotted gray\r\nhorse's head around and rode off.\r\n\r\nThe two hundred men of the spy battalion were trickling in behind Raoul,\r\nhoofs pattering on the bare earth. In their coonskin caps and dusty gray\r\nshirts and buckskin jackets, the men didn't look like soldiers, but they\r\nhad taken the oath and were under military discipline till their term of\r\nenlistment was up at the end of May.\r\n\r\nThe men called to one another and laughed as they gazed around at the\r\nempty lodges. They were enjoying themselves immensely, Raoul thought.\r\nThis time of year most of them would be breaking their backs doing\r\nspring plowing and planting. Now they could earn twenty-one cents a day\r\nwhile going on something like an extended hunting trip.\r\n\r\n_Most men would rather fight than work any day._\r\n\r\nEli Greenglove, on a brown and white pony, trotted up beside Raoul. His\r\nsilver lace captain's stripes glittered on the upper arms of the blue\r\ntunic Raoul had bought for him. A long cavalry saber hung from his white\r\nleather belt.\r\n\r\nEli grinned, and Raoul had to look away. It seemed that every other\r\ntooth in Eli's head was missing, and the ones that were left were\r\nstained brown from years of chewing tobacco.\r\n\r\nAnd now Clarissa had taken up pipe smoking, making it even harder for\r\nRaoul to enjoy bedding down with her.\r\n\r\n_If only Nancy--_\r\n\r\nBut Nancy had made it plain that she despised him.\r\n\r\nDamn shame. Of course, old Eli here would slit his throat if he had any\r\nidea what Raoul was thinking.\r\n\r\nEli said, \"You figger the Prophet's Town Injuns have joined up with\r\nBlack Hawk's bunch?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" said Raoul. \"And that means Black Hawk now has about a\r\nthousand warriors behind him.\"\r\n\r\nA movement on the south edge of the village in the surrounding woods\r\ncaught Raoul's eyes. He swung around in that direction, pointing his\r\npistol.\r\n\r\n\"Eli, get your rifle ready,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Loaded 'n' primed,\" said Greenglove, pulling his bright new Cramer\r\npercussion lock rifle--another present from Raoul--from its saddle\r\nsling, controlling his pony easily with his knees alone.\r\n\r\nIndians walked out of the woods, four men. They held their empty hands\r\nhigh over their heads and shuffled forward slowly.\r\n\r\n\"Watch 'em,\" said Eli. \"They may just be trying to get close enough to\r\njump us.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul studied the four advancing men. Two had their heads wrapped in\r\nturbans, one red, one blue. All four wore fringed buckskin leggings and\r\ngray flannel shirts. He saw no weapons.\r\n\r\nThen he caught sight of more shadowy figures in the trees beyond the\r\nIndians. Instantly, he straighted his arm in that direction and pulled\r\nthe trigger. His pistol went off with a boom, puffing out a cloud of\r\ngray smoke. He handed it to Armand to reload it while he reached for his\r\nown new rifle, a breech-loading Hall.\r\n\r\nThe Indian with the red turban was shouting something. Raoul recognized\r\nthe language--Potawatomi. The sound of it made the blood pound in his\r\ntemples.\r\n\r\n\"Those are only squaws and papooses,\" the Indian called in Potawatomi.\r\n\"Please do not shoot them.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul felt like shooting them all, just for being Potawatomi, but he\r\nheld the impulse in check. He had to find out whatever they could tell\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHe addressed the Indians in their language, indelibly engraved in his\r\nmind by the acids of fear and hatred. \"Tell them all to come out. We\r\nwill kill anyone who hides from us.\"\r\n\r\nThe red-turbaned Indian called over his shoulder, and slowly a group of\r\nwomen and small children came out of the woods.\r\n\r\nRaoul took his reloaded pistol back from Armand and walked Banner over\r\nto the little group. They started to lower their hands.\r\n\r\n\"Keep them up.\" He gestured with the pistol. Slowly the copper-skinned\r\nmen straightened their raised arms again, looking at one another\r\nunhappily.\r\n\r\n_Probably thought we'd welcome them with kind words and gifts._ The\r\nmuscles in his neck and shoulders were so rigid they ached, and his\r\nstomach was boiling. In his mind he saw again the scarred face of Black\r\nSalmon, the brown fist raised, holding a horsewhip to beat him. The\r\nsounds of Potawatomi speech brought it all back.\r\n\r\nHe handed his horse's reins to Armand, who tied Banner to an upright\r\npost in front of a nearby lodge.\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\" Raoul demanded.\r\n\r\n\"I am Little Foot,\" said the Indian wearing the red turban. \"I am head\r\nof the Deer Clan. We live here in the town of the Winnebago Prophet.\"\r\n\r\nLittle Foot's skin was dark, and he had a wide, flat nose. He wore no\r\nfeathers on his head, probably not wanting to look warlike. Black hair\r\nstreaked here and there with white hung down from under his turban in\r\ntwo braids to his shoulders. Raoul judged him to be in his fifties.\r\n\r\n_He could have been at Fort Dearborn twenty years ago._\r\n\r\nOne thing was certain. Little Foot was Potawatomi. Raoul felt his\r\nfingers tightening on his pistol as he held it at waist level.\r\n\r\nRaoul turned to Levi Pope and some of his other Smith County boys who\r\nwere seated on horses nearby. \"Tie them up.\"\r\n\r\nLevi, who wore six pistols at his belt, all primed and loaded, got down\r\nfrom his horse and unhooked a coiled rope from his saddle. \"The squaws\r\nand little ones too?\"\r\n\r\n\"Put their families in one of the lodges and keep a guard on them.\"\r\nAnother thought occurred to him. \"Eli, take some men and search these\r\nhuts. Make sure there aren't any more Indians hiding out somewhere in\r\nthis town.\"\r\n\r\nLevi went to the red-turbaned Indian and pulled his arms down roughly to\r\nhis sides. In a moment he had Little Foot's hands securely tied behind\r\nhis back, while other grinning Smith County boys had done the same to\r\nthe other three Indian men.\r\n\r\n\"Ankles too,\" said Raoul, and Levi and his men cut lengths of rope and\r\nknelt to hobble the Indians.\r\n\r\nWith his free hand Raoul took another long drink from the whiskey\r\ncanteen hanging from his saddle.\r\n\r\nHe walked close to Little Foot and looked him in the eye. He did not\r\nlike the way the Indian looked back at him. He saw no fear.\r\n\r\nWith a sudden movement he hooked his boot behind the Indian's hobbled\r\nankles and pushed him hard. Little Foot fell heavily to the ground on\r\nhis back, wincing with the unexpected pain.\r\n\r\nAs he pushed himself awkwardly into a sitting position, there was no\r\nmistaking the hatred in the way he looked up at Raoul.\r\n\r\n\"Why did you stay here?\" Raoul asked.\r\n\r\n\"We do not think Black Hawk can win. We hope the long knives will treat\r\nkindly those who do not make war on them.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul said, \"Where has Black Hawk gone? What is he planning? Where are\r\nthe people who were living in this town?\"\r\n\r\n\"I promised the Winnebago Prophet I would say nothing about where they\r\nwent. I will be accursed if I break my promise.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Winnebago Prophet's curse is nothing. You should be more afraid of\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nLittle Foot remained stone-faced and silent.\r\n\r\nWhat a pleasure to have a bunch of Potawatomi right where he could do\r\nanything he wanted to them.\r\n\r\nA light rain started to patter down on the bark roofs and the\r\nhard-packed earth.\r\n\r\nWhile Raoul had been talking with the Indians, more militiamen had\r\nreached Prophet's Town. Columns of men on horseback, four abreast, came\r\nto a halt in the grassland to the south of the village and fell out at\r\ntheir officers' commands. They climbed off their horses and walked them.\r\n\r\nOtto Wegner rode up and dismounted.\r\n\r\n\"General Atkinson is going to encamp the rest of the army outside\r\nProphet's Town, sir,\" he said, giving Raoul his usual vigorous salute,\r\nnearly dislodging the big hunting knife sheathed in a pocket of his\r\nleather shirt.\r\n\r\nRaoul returned the salute carelessly, went back to Banner and took\r\nanother swallow from the whiskey canteen.\r\n\r\nSurprising that Atkinson should decide to set up camp here, when the day\r\nwas only half over. Well, Henry Atkinson had a reputation for going\r\nslowly. Raoul had heard from friends among the regular officers that\r\nAtkinson had already received a sharply worded letter from the Secretary\r\nof War in Washington City reprimanding him for not moving fast enough to\r\ncrush the Indians.\r\n\r\n_If I get a chance to take a crack at them I sure as hell won't be\r\nslow._\r\n\r\nThe early arrivals already had their tents up. Officers' tents were of\r\nwhite canvas, six feet from the ground to their peaked tops. Enlisted\r\nmen set up pup tents just large enough to cover two men lying down. Most\r\nmen didn't bother to carry tents and slept out in the open, rolled up in\r\nthe coarse blankets they all carried.\r\n\r\nMen were wandering through Prophet's Town peering into the lodges. They\r\nwalked with slow caution, rifles ready.\r\n\r\nRaoul watched Justus Bennett, in civilian life Smith County's land\r\ncommissioner, ordering two privates in buckskins and coonskin caps to\r\nput up a tent for him. Bennett was always trying to make himself as\r\ncomfortable as possible. His packhorse carried his tenting, a big bag\r\nfull of fancy clothes, and a couple of heavy law books. Why on earth a\r\nman would think he needed such things in the wilderness, Raoul had no\r\nidea.\r\n\r\n\"Bennett!\" Raoul called. \"Take charge of the guard on those Indians.\"\r\n\r\nBennett looked annoyed, but gave some final instructions to the men\r\nputting up his tent and slouched over to the four Indians. A\r\nround-shouldered man of slight build, he looked decidedly unmilitary,\r\nbut he'd explained to Raoul that for anyone who wanted to get ahead in\r\npolitics, a war record would be a godsend.\r\n\r\nRaoul called out, \"Levi, you leave off guarding the Indians and get my\r\ntent up.\"\r\n\r\nA crowd of men had gathered in a circle around the Indians. Maybe they\r\nwanted to give the redskins a few licks of their own.\r\n\r\n\"Afternoon, Colonel.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul was used to looking down at other men, but he had to look up, a\r\nlittle, at the man who addressed him. His skinniness was like Pierre's\r\nin a way, but this man was a heap uglier than Raoul's brother had been.\r\nHe looked like a half-starved nag.\r\n\r\n_I'll bet he trips all over himself when he walks, and when he rides he\r\ndrags his feet on the ground._\r\n\r\nRaoul gestured to the seated Potawatomi. \"You boys ever see Indians up\r\nclose before?\"\r\n\r\n\"The way you've got them trussed up and guarded, Colonel,\" said the tall\r\nman, \"I'd say they must be pretty desperate characters.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul heard the smile in the drawling voice and felt heat rising up the\r\nback of his neck. He took a closer look at the man. He couldn't be much\r\nover twenty, but he looked a well-worn twenty. A farmer's face,\r\ndarkened by the sun. The gray eyes, set in deep hollows under heavy\r\nblack brows, crinkled humorously. But Raoul saw cold judgment deeper in\r\nthose eyes.\r\n\r\nLike most of the volunteers, the tall man wore civilian clothes. His\r\nwere gray trousers tucked into farmer's boots and a gray jacket over a\r\nblue calico shirt printed with white flowers. An officer's saber hung\r\nfrom a belt around his waist.\r\n\r\nRaoul said, \"Well, I reckon you signed up with the militia to fight\r\nIndians, so take a good look at your enemy.\"\r\n\r\nThe tall man walked around to stand in front of Little Foot, hunkered\r\ndown and said, \"Howdy.\"\r\n\r\nLittle Foot did not look back but gazed ahead with a blank face.\r\n\r\nThe lean man straightened up. \"A mighty mean customer, sir.\"\r\n\r\nSome of the other men in the ring around the Indians chuckled at this.\r\nEven Justus Bennett snickered.\r\n\r\nRaoul was feeling angrier and angrier. He had looked forward to\r\nquestioning Little Foot and the other Potawatomi, looked forward to\r\nhaving them resist and to breaking their resistance down with fear and\r\npain. He'd even hoped they might give him reason to shoot them. These\r\nstrange militiamen were becoming a nuisance.\r\n\r\n\"You seem to think this is pretty funny. Who the hell are you?\" Raoul\r\nput a threat into his voice.\r\n\r\n\"I'm Captain Lincoln of the Sangamon County company, sir. We're with the\r\nSecond Battalion.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul let his gaze travel over the other Sangamon County men.\r\n\r\n\"Any of the rest of you able to talk?\"\r\n\r\nOne man laughed. \"When Abe's around we mostly let him do the talking.\"\r\n\r\n\"That so? If you let somebody else do your talking for you, he may talk\r\nyou into a spot you won't like.\"\r\n\r\nAbe said, \"Oh, I always make sure I say what the men want said, sir.\"\r\nThat brought another laugh.\r\n\r\nRaoul's anger at the Potawatomi found a new target in this bony\r\nvolunteer. The heat of the whiskey raced through his bloodstream.\r\n\r\nThere was one simple way to show this upstart who was master here, and\r\nat the same time have his way with the redskins.\r\n\r\nRaoul drew his pistol and hefted it in his hand.\r\n\r\nThe tall captain eyed Raoul warily and said nothing.\r\n\r\nRaoul said, \"I'm going to give this Potawatomi one more chance to tell\r\nme now where Black Hawk went, and if he disobeys me again I'm going to\r\nshoot him dead.\"\r\n\r\nHe stood before Little Foot and pointed the pistol at his head.\r\n\r\nIn Potawatomi he said, \"Tell me what Black Hawk plans to do. Is he lying\r\nin ambush farther up the trail? Does he have a secret camp for his\r\nsquaws and papooses? Tell me, or I will shoot you.\" Swinging the muzzle\r\nof the pistol to the man in the blue turban beside Little Foot, he said,\r\n\"And then I will ask this man, and if he does not tell me, I will kill\r\nhim too.\"\r\n\r\nThe bony young man said, \"With all due respect to your rank and\r\nexperience, sir, I must say that what you propose to do is wrong.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul's rage threatened to boil over. Tension jerked his right arm. So\r\nas not to risk wasting a shot, he took his finger off the trigger.\r\n\r\nIn a mild but somehow penetrating voice the Sangamon man said, \"I'll\r\ntell you why this is wrong, sir, if you'll allow me.\"\r\n\r\nThe man's politeness was infuriating. Raoul turned to him, letting the\r\npistol fall to his side.\r\n\r\n\"Go on, Captain. Preach to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you had a white prisoner at your mercy, you would not shoot him\r\nbecause he refused to betray his comrades. You would think it honorable\r\nin him to answer your questions with silence. But this red man is a\r\nhuman being with the same God-given right to his life that you and I\r\nhave.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul realized all at once that the lean captain's backwoods manner of\r\nspeaking had fallen away like an unneeded cloak. He sounded like a\r\nlawyer or a minister.\r\n\r\n\"I was a prisoner of the Potawatomi for two years. I can tell you from\r\nexperience they're not human at all.\"\r\n\r\nHow angry Pierre had been when Raoul had said Indians were animals. But\r\nit was true.\r\n\r\n\"They treated you badly? Made a slave of you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Damned right.\"\r\n\r\nThe young captain looked calmly at Raoul. \"If to hold slaves and treat\r\nthem badly marks a man as less than human, then you must so brand every\r\nwealthy white man in the Southern states.\"\r\n\r\nA few of the men standing around laughed. \"That Abe! Got an answer for\r\neverything.\"\r\n\r\nAgain Raoul's hand tightened convulsively on the pistol grip. He'd\r\nwasted enough words on this walking skeleton from Sangamon County. He\r\nwas quivering with rage.\r\n\r\nThere was one quick way to put an end to the arguing.\r\n\r\nHe swung around and stepped close to Little Foot, holding his pistol\r\nless than a foot from the red-turbaned head. With his left hand he\r\npulled the hammer back to half-cock, then full. The double click sounded\r\nloud in a sudden, astonished silence.\r\n\r\nAnd Little Foot's arms, unbound, shot up. Both his hands gripped the\r\nbarrel of the pistol and yanked it to one side. About to pull the\r\ntrigger, Raoul froze his finger as the muzzle was pulled aside from its\r\ntarget.\r\n\r\n--And knew with a sudden sinking of his heart what a deadly mistake he\r\nhad made in that instant.\r\n\r\nThe Potawatomi's powerful two-handed grip tore the pistol from his\r\nfingers.\r\n\r\n_I should have fired. Now I am a dead man._\r\n\r\nRaoul saw a coil of rope lying on the ground beside Little Foot. The\r\nIndian must have been working his wrists loose while everyone's\r\nattention was on the argument.\r\n\r\nLittle Foot had already turned the loaded and cocked pistol around in\r\nhis hands and pointed it at Raoul's heart. Raoul stared into black eyes\r\nthat had no mercy for him.\r\n\r\nA blurred figure seemed to fly across Raoul's vision.\r\n\r\nThe pistol went off with a boom.\r\n\r\nCoughing, blinded, Raoul saw dimly through the gunsmoke that the skinny\r\ncaptain had thrown himself at Little Foot and thrust the pistol aside.\r\nNow Lincoln and Little Foot were wrestling, thrashing about like two\r\nwild animals.\r\n\r\nBy the time the smoke had cleared, the lean man had full control. Little\r\nFoot's ankles, Raoul saw, were still tied, and Lincoln's arms had snaked\r\nup under the Indian's. The Sangamon County man's big hands were behind\r\nLittle Foot's head, pushing his chin down into his chest. His long legs\r\nwere wrapped around Little Foot's middle, holding him in a crushing\r\nscissors grip.\r\n\r\nRaoul stood shaking, his eyes watering from the faceful of powder smoke\r\nhe'd taken. His heart was pounding frantically against his breastbone.\r\n\r\n\"Nicely done, sir!\" Justus Bennett said to Lincoln.\r\n\r\n_And what the hell were you doing?_ Raoul thought, furious at Bennett.\r\n\r\nWith a trembling hand Raoul seized Bennett's pistol.\r\n\r\nThe four guards had their rifles pointed at Little Foot. Any one of them\r\ncould have saved Raoul's life by shooting, but none of them had reacted\r\nquickly enough.\r\n\r\nOnly Lincoln had moved in time.\r\n\r\nThe lanky captain's comrades were cheering him. \"Old Abe's the best\r\nwrassler in this army, Colonel, and now you've seen it for yourself.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul wiped his eyes and shouted, \"Stand aside, Lincoln. Now I'm going\r\nto blow this redskin's brains out.\" The quaver he heard in his own voice\r\nmade him even angrier.\r\n\r\nFrom behind Little Foot came a calm response. \"I'm going to ask you not\r\nto do that, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"He tried to kill me. Get up and stand aside, God damn you!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.\"\r\n\r\nLincoln did unwrap his arms from Little Foot's head and shoulders, but\r\nstill held him with his legs. The Indian sat motionless, as if his\r\neffort to kill Raoul had taken the last of his strength. He muttered\r\nunder his breath. Probably his death song, Raoul thought.\r\n\r\nLincoln quickly retied the Indian, then stood up, placing himself\r\nbetween Raoul and Little Foot. He held Raoul's empty pistol out to him,\r\nbutt first.\r\n\r\n\"Colonel, I believe you're a fair man, and you'll agree that I just\r\nsaved your life.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul took his pistol and handed it to Armand, realizing that the tall\r\nman was maneuvering him into a difficult position. Too many men had seen\r\nwhat happened.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you did save my life.\" The words hurt his throat, same as if that\r\npistol ball had hit him and lodged there. \"And I thank you. You have my\r\nmost profound gratitude.\"\r\n\r\n\"That being so, and since I have done you what you might think a favor,\r\nwill you grant me a life for a life?\"\r\n\r\nFor a moment Raoul could not think of anything to say or do.\r\n\r\nAll he had to do was shove this Lincoln aside, put the muzzle of his\r\npistol to Little Foot's head and pull the trigger.\r\n\r\nHe realized, too, that the longer he hesitated the more a fool he\r\nlooked.\r\n\r\nWhat right did the skinny captain have to demand that he spare Little\r\nFoot?\r\n\r\nRaoul became aware that the crowd around them had grown to perhaps a\r\ncouple of hundred men. The ones he could see wore little half smiles.\r\nWhoever came out the winner, they were having a fine old time watching.\r\n\r\nRaoul was broader and maybe stronger than Lincoln. But how ridiculous he\r\nwould look if he had to fight the man to get past him to shoot Little\r\nFoot.\r\n\r\nAnd what if this bag of bones beat him?\r\n\r\n_Old Abe's the best wrassler in this army, Colonel._\r\n\r\nThe truth was bitter as vinegar, but the only course that would preserve\r\nhis dignity would be to let Lincoln have his way.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, hell,\" he said loudly, and was pleased to hear that while he'd\r\nstood silently thinking, his voice had regained its strength. \"Sure,\r\nI'll let the Indian live. He's nothing to me.\"\r\n\r\nHe noticed that his hand still shook a little as he gave Bennett's\r\npistol back to him. He took his own, reloaded, from Armand and holstered\r\nit, hoping no one could see his tremor.\r\n\r\n\"My hand on it,\" he said, holding out his right hand, willing it to be\r\nsteady.\r\n\r\nThe grip that met his was crushing. Even though he'd seen the bony young\r\nman immobilize Little Foot, Raoul was surprised.\r\n\r\nHe felt the men would expect him to do more to show his gratitude.\r\n\r\n\"Come and have a drink with me, Abe.\"\r\n\r\n\"My pleasure, sir.\"\r\n\r\nArmand had finished putting Raoul's tent up. In the tent Armand uncorked\r\na jug and handed it to Raoul, who offered it to Lincoln. The young man\r\nhooked his finger in the ring at the neck of the jug and raised it to\r\nhis mouth. Raoul watched the prominent Adam's apple rise and fall as he\r\ntook a long swallow.\r\n\r\n\"I normally don't touch whiskey, sir,\" Lincoln said, handing the jug\r\nback to Raoul. \"I've seen it ruin too many good men. But I do appreciate\r\nthis. It's not every day I grab a pistol as it goes off, wrestle an\r\nIndian and disobey a colonel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's the best whiskey there is. Old Kaintuck--O.K.\"\r\n\r\n\"Three things Kentucky makes better than anyplace else,\" said Lincoln.\r\n\"Quilts, rifles and whiskey. I should know. That's where I hail from.\"\r\n\r\nIt was because of men like this, Raoul thought with some disdain, that\r\nIllinoisians got their nickname, \"Suckers.\" The weak shoots of the\r\ntobacco plant that had to be stripped off and thrown away were called\r\nsuckers, and Illinois was said to be largely populated by ne'er-do-well\r\nemigrants from tobacco-growing states like Kentucky.\r\n\r\n\"Then here's to Kentucky,\" said Raoul, loathing the tall, ugly man for\r\nspoiling his revenge.\r\n\r\nHe lifted the jug to his lips and let the burning liquid roll over his\r\ntongue and slide down his throat, grateful to it for the warmth that\r\nwould melt away the chill of death he still felt around his heart.\r\n\r\nA few more swigs and Raoul found himself wanting to bring Lincoln around\r\nto his way of thinking. The man, after all, _had_ saved his life.\r\n\r\n\"You know, you went to a whole lot of bother over that Indian now,\" he\r\nsaid. \"It's a waste of time. We're only going to have to kill them all\r\nlater anyway.\"\r\n\r\nLincoln winced, as if Raoul's words had hurt him. \"Why do you say that,\r\nsir?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've got a big estate in Smith County, beside the Mississippi, miles\r\nand miles of wonderful fertile land just begging for the plow. And too\r\nmuch of it is growing nothing but prairie flowers, because I can't get\r\nenough people to come and work it for me. They're afraid of Indians!\"\r\n\r\n\"Treat the Indians fairly and there would be nothing to fear,\" said\r\nLincoln.\r\n\r\n\"Treat them fairly and they'll just continue to attack our settlements.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd like to think you're wrong, Mr. de Marion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why the hell did you volunteer for the militia, if you don't like\r\nkilling Indians?\"\r\n\r\nLincoln smiled faintly. \"Well, a war record won't hurt when I make a run\r\nfor the legislature.\"\r\n\r\nJust another slimy politician. Same as Bennett.\r\n\r\nA bluebelly, a blue-uniformed officer of the Federal army, pushed\r\nthrough the tent flap. He doffed his tall, cylindrical shako.\r\n\r\n\"General Atkinson's compliments, Colonel de Marion. We're breaking camp\r\nand moving on up the Rock River in pursuit of Black Hawk and his band.\r\nAnd he asks you to once again take up the lead position.\"\r\n\r\n\"How does the general know where the Sauk are?\" he asked irritably.\r\n\r\n\"A couple of Winnebago known to the general came into camp and offered\r\nto guide us, sir. They say Black Hawk and the Winnebago Prophet are\r\nleading their people upriver to try to persuade the Potawatomi to join\r\nthem. Black Hawk's whole band, except for the warriors, are on foot. The\r\ngeneral thinks that if we ride hard we can catch them.\"\r\n\r\nLincoln held out his hand and shook again with Raoul.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you for the whiskey, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you for turning that pistol aside.\"\r\n\r\nLincoln grinned. \"Colonel, thank _you_ for sparing that red man. I'll be\r\ngoing now, or by the time we finish thanking each other, Black Hawk will\r\nbe in Checagou.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Raoul emerged from his tent he saw that the Potawatomi prisoners\r\nwere gone. He felt a surge of fury that someone had turned them loose\r\nwithout his permission. He still longed to put a ball into the skull of\r\nthat sneaking Little Foot.\r\n\r\n_The next Indian who falls into my hands won't be so lucky._\r\n\r\nBy the time the men of his spy battalion had struck their tents and\r\nmounted up, he had decided on half a loaf of revenge. Seated on Banner,\r\nhe held up a burning stick.\r\n\r\n\"All right, men, the Winnebago who lived here have joined up with Black\r\nHawk. They're running ahead of us. Let's not leave them anything to come\r\nback to.\"\r\n\r\nHe drew his arm back and snapped it forward. The torch flew end over end\r\nand landed on the bark roof of the nearest Winnebago lodge. A circle of\r\norange flame spread out quickly. It was still raining, but not enough to\r\nslow the fire down much.\r\n\r\nRaoul's men whooped. Eli and Armand led the way in hurling flaming\r\nsticks into the dark brown Indian huts.\r\n\r\nArmand, grinning, handed Raoul a long pole he'd pulled loose from the\r\nwall of a lodge, afire at one end. Waving his broad-brimmed hat, Raoul\r\nrode through the town touching the burning pole to the flimsy wall of\r\neach lodge he passed. The men of the battalion scattered, setting fires\r\neverywhere. Beyond the town the remaining militiamen stopped breaking\r\ncamp to watch.\r\n\r\nSoon, the roar of the burning lodges thundered in Raoul's ears like a\r\nbig waterfall.\r\n\r\nIf they could catch Black Hawk, he thought, what glory that would be. No\r\nmatter how many fighting men Black Hawk had, Raoul felt sure his\r\nbattalion could crush them. The burning lodges, the whiskey in his\r\nblood, the hatred in his heart, all ran together so that Raoul felt like\r\na prairie fire racing after the British Band.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n14\r\n\r\nFirst Blood\r\n\r\n\r\nWhite Bear tried to think only about guiding his brown-spotted white\r\npony over the grasslands and watching his two companions. He tried to\r\nput fear out of his mind.\r\n\r\n_I did not even have a chance to say good-bye to Redbird._\r\n\r\nRedbird was a day's ride up the Rock River from here, at the camp the\r\nPotawatomi had allowed Black Hawk's people to set up. White Bear's body\r\nwent cold with the thought that he might be killed today, and she be\r\nleft alone and pursued by enemies.\r\n\r\n_I should have asked Wolf Paw to be her protector if I die. He hates me,\r\nbut he cares for Redbird._\r\n\r\nIt was for Redbird and Eagle Feather, and for the baby growing inside\r\nRedbird, that he was risking his life today. His family was going\r\nhungry. It had been over six weeks, by pale eyes reckoning, since Black\r\nHawk had led them across the Great River into Illinois. White Bear and\r\nRedbird, like other British Band families, could carry little food with\r\nthem, and most of that was gone. With the long knives pressing behind\r\nthem, White Bear had no time to hunt or fish, nor Redbird to gather food\r\nfrom the woodlands.\r\n\r\nShe must not go without food, especially not while carrying their child.\r\nThe children of the British Band walked about hollow-eyed; the crying of\r\nhungry babies rose from every part of the camp. Old people, looking\r\nnearly dead, lay on the ground trying to husband their strength.\r\n\r\nAt a secret meeting last night the Potawatomi chiefs, despite Flying\r\nCloud's prophecy, had refused to join Black Hawk in fighting the long\r\nknives or even to give his people supplies or let them remain long in\r\nPotawatomi territory. Black Hawk himself had been forced to admit that\r\nthe only way to spare the band further hardship would be to go quietly\r\nback across the Great River.\r\n\r\nTo do that, he had to make peace with the long knives. Frightened though\r\nhe was, White Bear, as the only member of the tribe who spoke fluent\r\nEnglish, felt he must go with Black Hawk's emissaries.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear's shoulders slumped in discouragement as he thought how Black\r\nHawk and the rest of the band had been led astray. _No_ other tribes\r\nwere willing to ally themselves with the British Band. There had been\r\n_no_ truth at all to the Winnebago Prophet's talk of aid from the\r\nBritish in Canada.\r\n\r\nA delegation headed by Broth, the tribe's best speaker, had gone to the\r\nBritish fort at Malden, near Detroit, to ask for help. They had been\r\nsent back with the advice that the Sauk had better learn to live in\r\npeace with the Americans.\r\n\r\nThe people of Prophet's Town had left their homes with Black Hawk's band\r\nmore out of fear of the oncoming long knives than out of a desire to\r\nhelp Black Hawk fight for Saukenuk. As Black Hawk's prospects worsened,\r\nmost of them drifted away, even though the Prophet himself remained at\r\nBlack Hawk's side.\r\n\r\nBlack Hawk had believed the Prophet because his promises gave the\r\nBritish Band the courage to defy the long knives. To White Bear's\r\ndisgust, even now, when it was clear that Flying Cloud had simply made\r\nit all up, Black Hawk had forgiven the Prophet.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear burned with resentment.\r\n\r\n_They mocked me when I told them the truth. That fat, posturing toad\r\nlied to them and they still honor him. Surely a false shaman is the\r\nworst kind of liar._\r\n\r\nWhite Bear rode on Little Crow's right. As the oldest of the three men,\r\nLittle Crow carried the white flag. Torn from a sheet the braves had\r\nfound in a settler's hastily abandoned cabin, the flag was tied to a\r\nspear shaft from which the head had been removed. On Little Crow's left\r\nrode Three Horses.\r\n\r\nSince they were not riding into battle, they had not taken any of the\r\nsaddles with stirrups from the band's supply but were mounted with only\r\nblankets between themselves and the horses' backs. The three of them\r\nhad painted their faces black, because they might be going to their\r\ndeaths. But it was hard to believe that men might be killed on this\r\nbeautiful afternoon in the middle of the Moon of Buds. A warm breeze\r\nblew over White Bear's bare chest and arms. Red, blue and yellow prairie\r\nflowers scattered over the land, as uncountable as the stars, delighted\r\nhis eye in spite of his fear. All around him he heard red-winged\r\nblackbirds singing their spring challenges.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear had left with Owl Carver everything he valued: his medicine\r\nstick, his Sauk medicine bag and his other bag of pale eyes' medical\r\ninstruments, his megis-shell necklace, his brass and silver ornaments,\r\nhis _Paradise Lost_, the deerhorn-handled knife his father had long ago\r\ngiven him. He had nothing with him but the clothing he wore, fringed\r\nbuckskin leggings and a buckskin vest decorated with blue and green\r\nquillwork in diamond patterns.\r\n\r\nHe looked back and saw five mounted braves an arrow flight behind him on\r\nthe prairie. Even from this distance he could tell that the tall one in\r\nthe middle was Iron Knife. They would watch from hiding and would report\r\nback to Black Hawk how the long knives treated his peace messengers.\r\nBlack Hawk himself, with Owl Carver, the Winnebago Prophet, Wolf Paw and\r\nabout forty braves, waited a few miles farther up the Rock River at the\r\nplace where he had met with the Potawatomi chiefs.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear saw a small stand of woods ahead. Scouts had reported that\r\nbeyond those woods, across Old Man's Creek, the long knives had set up\r\ncamp. Glowing from behind young green leaves, set aflutter by the\r\nbreeze, the setting sun dropped flecks of gold onto the blackened faces\r\nof White Bear's two companions. It would be almost nightfall by the time\r\nthey encountered the long knives.\r\n\r\nThree Horses said, \"A man must be more brave, I think, to do this than\r\nto ride up to an enemy in battle and strike the first blow at him.\" His\r\nnose curved inward where the bridge should have been. White Bear had\r\nlearned that a Sioux war club had done that to him while Auguste was\r\nstudying Latin and geometry at St. George's School.\r\n\r\n\"I would much rather be fighting the long knives than trying to make\r\npeace with them,\" said Little Crow. \"I do not trust them.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear tried to reassure them and himself. \"We must do this. It is\r\nthe only way we can get our people safely back across the Great River.\"\r\n\r\nLittle Crow said, \"It seems you were right and we who wanted to take up\r\nthe tomahawk were wrong.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of his fear, White Bear felt a satisfied glow at Little Crow's\r\nwords. Little Crow had been the one who brought the woman's dress that\r\nWolf Paw had put on him that wretched night of the council.\r\n\r\n_They did not listen to me that night. The Turtle told me I would not be\r\nable to persuade the people not to cross the Great River, but I tried my\r\nbest._\r\n\r\nThey entered the wood by way of a narrow trail, riding single file.\r\nLittle Crow lowered the white flag to keep it from getting caught in the\r\nbranches.\r\n\r\nAs they rode among the trees, the tightness of fear in White Bear's\r\nchest and stomach grew worse, until he had to struggle for breath. His\r\npalms sweat so much, the reins were slippery in his hands.\r\n\r\nHe turned and waved farewell to Iron Knife and the four other braves\r\nfollowing them, who had halted their ponies at the edge of the woods and\r\ndismounted. They waved back. A moment more and White Bear looked back\r\nand could see them no more.\r\n\r\n_At least if I die today Iron Knife can tell Redbird how it came about._\r\n\r\nHe tried to guess how the long knives would greet them. They might shoot\r\nthem down in spite of the white flag. He hoped they would be glad to\r\nlearn that Black Hawk wanted to surrender and return in peace to Ioway.\r\nAfter all, that was what they were trying to force him to do, was it\r\nnot? But some of the long knives, undoubtedly, wanted to kill \"Injuns.\"\r\nMen like Raoul.\r\n\r\nWhen they came out of the south edge of the woods, they found themselves\r\non a grassy rise sloping down to a winding stream called Old Man's\r\nCreek. The sun was lower now and directly in White Bear's eyes. Across\r\nthe creek was a sight that made him want to jerk his pony's head around\r\nand ride back into the trees as fast as he could go.\r\n\r\nOn high ground he saw the silhouettes of peaked tents and many men, some\r\non horseback and some on foot, rifles in hand. The smoke of campfires\r\ndrifted like gray feathers into the pale blue sky. He heard voices\r\ncalling to one another in English. One man shouted and pointed in their\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear said, \"Don't wait here at the edge of the trees, or they will\r\nthink we are attackers. Ride forward slowly, waving the flag.\"\r\n\r\nThe men across the creek were yelling excitedly now. Rifle fire crackled\r\nand smoke billowed. A ball whizzed past White Bear and cracked a tree\r\nlimb behind him. He held himself rigid.\r\n\r\nLong knives rode toward them, urging their horses down the far side of\r\nthe creekbank. White Bear and his companions rode into the creek to meet\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIn a moment bearded white faces, angry eyes, coonskin caps and straw\r\nhats were whirling about the three emissaries in the middle of the\r\ncreek. Rifles and pistols were pointing at them from every side. Little\r\nCrow, his face tight, held the white flag high with both hands.\r\n\r\n\"We surrender!\" White Bear shouted. \"We are not armed. We have come to\r\ntalk to General Atkinson.\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen to that, he's talking English,\" a blond boy exclaimed.\r\n\r\nAnother man yelled, \"Shoot 'em. Then let 'em surrender.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear's knees trembled against his horse's flanks. These were not\r\nregular U.S. government soldiers, but the volunteers, the armed settlers\r\nwho had come out in answer to their governor's call. They would not wait\r\nfor orders from their commanders. They would do whatever they felt like\r\ndoing.\r\n\r\nA red-bearded man stuck his face in White Bear's. \"Get down off that\r\nhorse, Injun! Now!\" His shout blew a stink of whiskey into White Bear's\r\nface.\r\n\r\nOthers joined the outcry. \"Get off them horses!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ought to put a bullet in them right here in the creek.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look at them black faces. I thought they was niggers at first.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not even useful like niggers, damn redskins.\"\r\n\r\nThe man with the red beard grabbed White Bear's arm and jerked him half\r\nout of his saddle. White Bear slid down from his horse.\r\n\r\nHe stood up to his knees in the cold, rushing water of Old Man's Creek.\r\n\r\n\"We want to surrender,\" he said again. \"We want to talk to your\r\nofficers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just shut up!\" the red-bearded man roared, eyes rolling drunkenly.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear felt a man grab him from behind. A rope scratched his wrists\r\nand tightened around them till the bones were crushed together.\r\n\r\nHe turned to see whether Little Crow and Three Horses were all right.\r\nThe militiamen had bound them too. Both braves' black-painted faces were\r\nexpressionless, but White Bear read fear in their eyes and in the set of\r\ntheir mouths--the same fear he felt, and tried not to show.\r\n\r\nThe red-bearded man leaned down from his saddle and grabbed a handful of\r\nWhite Bear's long hair. He jerked on it, dragging White Bear toward the\r\nbank. White Bear stumbled on the stony creekbed, bruising his feet\r\nthrough his moccasins.\r\n\r\n\"You wanna see our officers? Then step along!\"\r\n\r\nWhat had happened to the white flag? Without it, what did they have to\r\nshow that they had come in peace?\r\n\r\n\"Will you bring our white flag?\" he called desperately to a clean-shaven\r\nman wearing spectacles, who looked a little calmer than the others.\r\n\r\nThe man's face twisted into a snarl, and White Bear's heart fell.\r\n\r\n\"You'll get your white flag up your ass, redskin!\"\r\n\r\n\"You sound just like a white man,\" said another militiaman. \"You sure\r\nyou ain't a white man in paint?\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen to me,\" White Bear said hopelessly. He wanted to say, _If we\r\ndon't fight it will save your lives as well as ours._ But how could he\r\ntalk to these men, maddened by whiskey and war? His eyes met those of\r\nLittle Crow and Three Horses. Again the red-bearded man jerked his hair,\r\nso hard White Bear thought he would pull it out of his scalp. He had to\r\nbite his lip to keep from crying out. Worse than the pain was the\r\nindignity.\r\n\r\nHorses splashing water, mud and pebbles on them, long knives shouting\r\ncurses and threats, the three Sauk stumbled out of the creek and through\r\nshoulder-high prairie grass into the militia camp.\r\n\r\nThe sun's last rays fell on flushed, sweating white faces, on glistening\r\nrifle barrels. To White Bear, most of the men looked younger than he.\r\n\r\n\"Somebody get the colonel,\" said the man with the red beard. \"Tell him\r\nthey claim they want to surrender. Might be we could catch old Black\r\nHawk himself.\"\r\n\r\nThe three Sauks' only hope, White Bear thought, was that the commanding\r\nofficer might be more willing to listen to them than his men were.\r\n\r\nThe Sauk and their captors stood in a circle where the grass had been\r\ntrampled flat. A short distance away stood supply wagons and tents. The\r\nprairie surrounded them.\r\n\r\nSome militiamen went to one wagon on which five kegs with spouts stood,\r\nfilled tin cups from the kegs and drank from them. Whiskey, White Bear\r\nthought, seemed to be as important to these men as food.\r\n\r\nThe sun was down now, and the three stood in twilight, in the midst of\r\nthe shouting mob.\r\n\r\n\"Look alive, you men! It's the colonel!\"\r\n\r\nThe crowd opened up, and two men came through.\r\n\r\nOne of them, short, skinny, wearing a coonskin cap and a blue officer's\r\ncoat, came up to White Bear and peered at him.\r\n\r\n\"I know you!\"\r\n\r\nHalf his teeth were rotten and the rest were missing. White Bear knew\r\nhim too. Eli Greenglove.\r\n\r\n\"By God, Raoul! I'll be a son of a bitch if it ain't that half-breed\r\nnephew of yours.\"\r\n\r\nAnd there stood Raoul de Marion, gold epaulets glittering on his broad\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\nAt the sight of that broad face with the black mustache, last seen\r\nlooking at him over a pistol barrel, White Bear knew his life was about\r\nto end.\r\n\r\n_Could my luck be any worse?_\r\n\r\nAll hope vanished as light faded from the sky.\r\n\r\nRaoul stood before White Bear with his thumbs hooked into the white\r\nleather belt that cinched his blue uniform coat. His huge knife--the one\r\nthat had cut White Bear's face years ago--hung at his left side, a\r\npistol at his right. He grinned at White Bear.\r\n\r\n\"Well. I was hoping to meet you. I'd have liked it better on the field\r\nof battle, but here you are, in my camp. What were you doing, spying on\r\nus?\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear sighed. Something crumbled inside him.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know this long knife?\" Little Crow said in Sauk.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he is my father's brother.\" A glimmer of hope appeared in Little\r\nCrow's eyes, but vanished when White Bear added, \"And he is my worst\r\nenemy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Talk English around me!\" Raoul shouted. \"No Indian jabber.\"\r\n\r\n\"Black Hawk sent us,\" White Bear said. \"He doesn't want to fight. We've\r\ncome to make peace.\"\r\n\r\n\"The hell with that!\" one of Raoul's men yelled. \"We come out to fight\r\nInjuns.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, hold on now!\" cried another. \"If they come peaceable, that means\r\nwe can all go home and nobody hurt.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul turned on the man. \"I'll be the one to decide why they're here.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear realized that the men with Raoul were barely under his\r\ncontrol. There was no hope of talking to Raoul, but there might be\r\nothers in this crowd, like the man who had just spoken, who would\r\nlisten. He must keep trying.\r\n\r\nRaising his voice White Bear said, \"Chief Black Hawk knows you\r\nmilitiamen outnumber his warriors. He doesn't want to fight you. All he\r\nwants is to be allowed to go back down the Rock River and cross the\r\nMississippi. He will never come back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where'd that black-faced redskin learn to speak English so good?\" one\r\nof the militiamen said.\r\n\r\n\"He's a renegade,\" said Raoul. \"A part-white mongrel. He ought to be\r\nhanged as a traitor. Don't believe a word he says.\"\r\n\r\n\"They did come with a white flag,\" one of the men said.\r\n\r\n\"White flag, hell!\" Raoul shouted. \"They're trying to put us off guard.\"\r\nHe swept a pointing finger across a group of men that included\r\nbrown-bearded Armand Perrault. Among them White Bear recognized Levi\r\nPope and Otto Wegner, the thick-mustached Prussian who worked at the\r\ntrading post. He remembered Wegner had not wanted to kill him when Raoul\r\noffered a reward for his death, and he felt a little tremor of hope.\r\n\r\n\"Get on your horses,\" Raoul told his men. \"Go out across the creek and\r\nlook. If you don't find Indians skulking about in those woods, I'll be\r\nmighty surprised.\"\r\n\r\nAs Raoul's men rode off, White Bear was torn by indecision. Should he\r\ntell Raoul that other braves had followed them here, to see how they\r\nwere treated? Or would that just endanger the lives of Iron Knife and\r\nthe others?\r\n\r\n_He'll use everything I tell him against me._\r\n\r\nRaoul's eyes stared death at White Bear. \"Black Hawk's a damn liar. He's\r\nbroken every treaty we ever made with you people. There's only one way\r\nto deal with your kind. If you can't be trusted to keep treaties, you\r\nhave to be exterminated.\" He drew his pistol.\r\n\r\n\"Starting here.\"\r\n\r\n_Bear spirit, walk with me on the Trail of Souls._\r\n\r\nLittle Crow said, \"What do they say, White Bear? Are they going to kill\r\nus?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is our fate to have fallen into the hands of a bad man,\" said White\r\nBear. Having to tell them hurt him all the more. It grieved him that\r\nthese two good men must die along with him, their lives thrown away\r\nbecause of a bit of bad luck.\r\n\r\n\"We were fools to come here,\" said Three Horses.\r\n\r\n\"Not fools--braves,\" White Bear reassured him. \"A man who gives his life\r\nto protect his people is never a fool. Whether or not he succeeds.\"\r\n\r\n\"You _are_ a prophet, White Bear,\" said Little Crow.\r\n\r\nRaoul was staring at White Bear's chest. White Bear wondered if his\r\nheart was beating so hard that Raoul could see it hammering.\r\n\r\n\"Look at those scars. Looks like a bear tried to get you a long time\r\nago. Too bad he didn't finish you, would have saved me the trouble.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear would not talk about anything sacred with Raoul. He looked\r\nback at him silently.\r\n\r\n\"Guess you don't know all there is to know about your nephew,\" Eli\r\nGreenglove laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Don't call him my nephew!\" Raoul shouted.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear saw some of Raoul's men exchange befuddled glances.\r\n\r\n\"Well, whatever he is, I kind of think we ought to send him and these\r\nothers back down the line. Let them palaver with the general. It ain't\r\nfor us to decide.\"\r\n\r\n\"What the hell do you mean?\" Raoul thundered.\r\n\r\nThe popping of rifle fire on the other side of Old Man's Creek cut short\r\nthe argument. White Bear turned to look.\r\n\r\nA moment later Perrault, his horse's legs dripping creek water, came\r\npounding up.\r\n\r\n\"You were right, mon colonel,\" he panted. \"Those woods are full of\r\nIndians. They were sneaking up on the camp.\"\r\n\r\n\"These three were supposed to distract us with peace talk while the\r\nothers snuck up on us,\" Raoul shouted to his men. \"First we'll shoot\r\nthese Indians. Then we'll hunt down the rest of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"It wasn't an ambush!\" White Bear cried. \"There were only five of them,\r\nand they were just there to see what happened to us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, why didn't you tell us they were out there?\" Raoul said, smiling.\r\n\"We'd have invited them in for a whiskey.\"\r\n\r\nThe coonskin-capped men standing near him guffawed.\r\n\r\nRaoul's lips stretched in a grimace. \"Eli, Armand, let's shoot these\r\nthree redskins.\"\r\n\r\nGreenglove said, \"Raoul--Colonel--I still say you ought to think this\r\nover.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shut up and do what I say!\" Raoul growled. \"I want to get this done and\r\nride after those other Indians.\"\r\n\r\nMen were running for their horses and leaping into the saddle\r\nbrandishing rifles. Without leaders or orders, they rode off across the\r\ncreek with drunken whoops in the direction Armand had pointed out.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear felt sick as he saw that many of the men who remained were\r\ngrinning avidly. How, he wondered, could their deaths give such pleasure\r\nto these men?\r\n\r\nDesperate to find help, he searched the ring of men surrounding him for\r\na face to appeal to. It was already too dark to see expressions clearly.\r\nHopelessness turned his heart to lead as he saw Otto Wegner turn and\r\nwalk away from the crowd. Even though Wegner had always been Raoul's man\r\nand never a friend of his, he felt betrayed.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said Raoul, staring into White Bear's eyes. \"I'll shoot the\r\nmongrel. Eli, you shoot the short one with the flat nose. Armand, you\r\ntake the other one.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Vec plaisir,\" said Armand, his teeth showing white in his brown beard\r\nas he brought his rifle up to his shoulder.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear felt the clench of nausea in his middle. Only pride kept him\r\nfrom doubling up and vomiting in his terror.\r\n\r\n\"Don't do this, please,\" he cried. \"We came to you to make peace.\"\r\n\r\n\"They mean to kill us,\" said Little Crow. \"Talk no more to them, White\r\nBear. Do not plead. It is unbecoming a Sauk.\" White Bear felt a rush of\r\nadmiration for the strength and calm in Little Crow's voice. Here,\r\ntruly, was a brave.\r\n\r\nLittle Crow raised his voice in song.\r\n\r\n    \"In your brown blanket, O Earthmaker,\r\n    Wrap your son and carry him away.\r\n    Fold him again in your body.\r\n    Let his bones turn to rocks,\r\n    Let his flesh turn to grass.\r\n    Give his eyes to the birds,\r\n    Give his ears to the deer.\r\n    Grow flowers from his heart.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear and Three Horses joined in. There was nothing else to do.\r\nWhite Bear wanted to die singing, not weeping.\r\n\r\nWhat a miserable death this was, even so! And still, he found that the\r\nsong made his heart feel strong and his terror give way to a stern\r\nanger. Murdered because of the simple, stupid bad luck that Raoul's band\r\nof militiamen happened to be the advance guard of the long knives.\r\nSurrounded by drunken savages--yes, they were the savages, not himself\r\nand Three Horses and Little Crow.\r\n\r\nInfuriating to think of the love and education his father had lavished\r\non him, all wasted now. All the years of following the shaman's path,\r\nended by a lead ball. Before he had accomplished anything.\r\n\r\nAnd Redbird and Eagle Feather and the baby to come-- If not for them he\r\nmight accept the inevitable. Step onto the Trail of Souls with grace and\r\ndignity. But, even more for their sake than for his own, he did not want\r\nto die.\r\n\r\nFrantic with fear and anger, he looked for a way of escape. The camp was\r\nin the midst of prairie grass almost as high as a man's head. The sun\r\nhad gone down, and twilight was deepening. But Raoul was walking toward\r\nhim, holding his pistol high. And beyond him, between White Bear and the\r\ngrass, was a ring of men with rifles.\r\n\r\nAll that was left for him was to die with honor.\r\n\r\nHe raised his voice to sing louder.\r\n\r\n_I must put all my strength into this. It is the last song I will sing\r\non earth._\r\n\r\n\"Stop that goddamned caterwauling!\" Raoul shouted.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear watched numbly as Armand Perrault brought his rifle to his\r\nshoulder, stepped up to Little Crow, put the muzzle of the rifle to the\r\nbrave's head and pulled the trigger. The flint clicked down and\r\nsparked, and powder sizzled in the pan. The rifle went off with a roar,\r\nenveloping the brave's head in a pink cloud of smoke, blood, bits of\r\nflesh and bone.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear staggered backward, dizzy with shock and terror.\r\n\r\nThree Horses shouted, \"I will not die so!\" He jerked free from the men\r\nwho were holding him and plunged into the grass, hands still bound\r\nbehind him. He ran toward the Rock River.\r\n\r\nRifles boomed.\r\n\r\nIn his panic, White Bear felt as if all the breath had been knocked out\r\nof him. Three Horses might have a chance. He was a short man, and the\r\ngrass was tall. And light was fading moment by moment.\r\n\r\nIf White Bear stood where he was an instant longer he would be dead.\r\nThis was his only chance. No one was holding him. No one was even\r\npointing a gun at him. All of them, even Raoul, were staring after Three\r\nHorses. Many of the men had fired and would need time to reload.\r\n\r\nEvery muscle in his body quivered. He jerked his hands. The rope was\r\nstill tight around his wrists. Running would be awkward. But Three\r\nHorses had shown that it could be done.\r\n\r\n_Run!_\r\n\r\nWhite Bear heard the voice in his mind. His own voice or the Bear\r\nspirit's? It did not matter.\r\n\r\nHe ran.\r\n\r\nHe threw all the strength in his legs into a sudden spring, away from\r\nthe distracted long knives. He dove into the grass, running away from\r\nthe river; opposite the way Three Horses had gone. With his arms behind\r\nhim, he ran with his head and shoulders thrust forward. The grasses and\r\ntall plants slapped his face. His feet pounded the earth. His legs\r\npumped furiously. His breath roared in his chest. His heart thundered.\r\n\r\n\"Hey, the other Injun's gettin' away!\"\r\n\r\n\"Goddamn it, _get_ him!\" Raoul's voice, shrill with wild rage.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear's moccasined feet seemed to be flying over the ground. He\r\nfelt the Bear spirit giving him strength. A curtain of prairie grass\r\nfell away ahead of him and swished shut behind him. Even the grass was\r\nhelping. It was almost high enough to hide him as he ran in a crouch, as\r\nhis bound wrists forced him to do.\r\n\r\nHe was already deep into the prairie when he heard the calm voice of Eli\r\nGreenglove cutting through the cool, clear air.\r\n\r\n\"Hold your fire, everybody. He's mine. Got a bead on him.\"\r\n\r\nA moment later lightning struck the side of White Bear's head, sudden\r\nand stunning. He heard the rifle's roar just an instant after the bullet\r\nhit him. It struck so hard, it left him no strength to scream. His right\r\near felt as if it had been torn away from his skull. A blaze of agony\r\nblinded him. He staggered.\r\n\r\nBut he was alive.\r\n\r\n_Play dead!_\r\n\r\nIt was the same voice in his mind that had told him to run. Now he was\r\nsure it was the Bear spirit.\r\n\r\nHe shut his eyes, threw himself at once to the ground. The earth came up\r\nand hit him in the face as hard as a fist in the jaw. Stunned for a\r\nmoment, he sucked air into his chest and let it out slowly. He lay\r\nperfectly still. His ear felt as if someone had laid a burning torch on\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"Got the sonofabitch,\" came Eli Greenglove's flat voice from only a\r\nshort distance away.\r\n\r\nBut he was still alive. And no one was shooting at him. His body went\r\nlimp with relief.\r\n\r\nHe could not believe that he was still alive and conscious.\r\n\r\n_Maybe I am dead. Maybe my spirit will stand up in a moment and start\r\nwalking west._\r\n\r\nGreenglove was supposed to be the best shot in Smith County. Could he\r\nreally mistakenly think he hit White Bear square in the head? His eyes\r\nwere better than that.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear heard distant shots.\r\n\r\n_Earthmaker, let Three Horses live!_\r\n\r\nIf Three Horses had not run when he did, White Bear would not be alive\r\nnow. But White Bear remembered with anguish that he had seen Little Crow\r\ndie.\r\n\r\n_Oh, my brother!_ Even though half dead with pain and terror himself, he\r\nmourned the brave who had died before his eyes.\r\n\r\nBlood pounded in White Bear's head. Night was growing steadily deeper.\r\nBy not moving and by taking only the tiniest breaths he might appear to\r\nbe dead. He lay with his mutilated right ear uppermost. He felt streams\r\nof blood running like lines of ants over his scalp and his cheek. They\r\ntickled his neck. To lie perfectly still was agony.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear heard Raoul's voice say, \"Make sure of him, Eli.\"\r\n\r\n\"Damn hellfire nation!\" Eli came back. \"Don't I know when I've put a man\r\nunder?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's dark and you've had a lot of whiskey. Make sure of him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pure waste of time,\" said Greenglove.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear heard footsteps rustling through the grass toward him. The\r\neffort of keeping himself from moving threatened to tear his muscles\r\nfrom his bones. His heart beat harder as the steps came closer. Surely\r\nGreenglove could hear its thudding. But he froze himself and held his\r\nbreath as the feet stopped beside him. In stillness was his only hope.\r\nThe pain throbbed in his ear.\r\n\r\n_He'll see that he just hit my ear, and that will be the end._\r\n\r\nShould he jump up and run for it? No, Greenglove would not miss a second\r\ntime. Let the Bear spirit dim Greenglove's sharp eyes. Let him be\r\ndeceived into thinking White Bear dead. There was no other way he could\r\nescape.\r\n\r\nHe waited for the shot that would smash into his brain.\r\n\r\n\"Right through the skull,\" Greenglove called out. \"Ain't even enough\r\nleft to scalp him.\"\r\n\r\nAmazement flooded through White Bear. That couldn't be what Greenglove\r\nsaw. Unless he was blind drunk. Or blinded by the Bear.\r\n\r\n_Or he doesn't want to kill me._\r\n\r\nHadn't he tried to talk Raoul out of shooting the three of them?\r\n\r\nWhite Bear remembered Greenglove swinging the rifle at him the day of\r\nhis father's funeral. If Greenglove hadn't knocked him out, Raoul would\r\nhave shot him.\r\n\r\nHe was too frightened to try to understand it. He was alive, that was\r\nall he could be sure of. Alive for a little while longer.\r\n\r\n\"He's in the happy hunting ground.\" Greenglove's voice faded a little as\r\nhe walked away. \"Want us to dig a hole for him?\"\r\n\r\n\"We don't bury dead Indians,\" said Raoul. \"Let them rot. Let the\r\nbuzzards get fat on them.\" He raised his voice. \"Every man mount up and\r\nchase the ones there in the woods across the creek. This may be our\r\nchance to finish Black Hawk.\"\r\n\r\n\"What happened to that other Injun that ran away?\" Greenglove asked.\r\n\r\n\"We got him,\" a militiaman said. \"He made it almost to the river. But\r\nhe's got enough lead in him now to start his own mine.\"\r\n\r\nGrief filled White Bear's motionless body. Little Crow and Three Horses,\r\nboth killed. Three Horses' death had given him back his life. Three\r\nHorses, the first Sauk to greet him on his return to the tribe. His two\r\ncomrades surely deserved to escape death as much as he did. Why had he\r\nalone been spared? He wanted to cry out, as sorrow for his fallen\r\ncomrades tore into him, but he drew in his lower lip. He bit down on it\r\nhard, clenching his teeth in his flesh until he felt no pain anywhere\r\nelse, in mind or body.\r\n\r\n_Good-bye, Three Horses. Good-bye, Little Crow. I will burn tobacco to\r\nthe spirits for you._\r\n\r\nBoots clumped through the prairie grass all around him. Hoof-beats\r\npounded past him. He feared he would be trampled, and it took\r\nback-breaking effort to hold still. But the horses avoided his body.\r\n\r\nGradually the thundering passage of Raoul's men died away to the north.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor a long time White Bear heard nothing but the creek rippling over its\r\nbed of stones, the wind in the trees, crickets buzzing on the prairie.\r\nTiny creatures tickled his flesh as they hurried over his face and body.\r\nTo them he had already become part of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe burning in his ear settled down to a numb ache.\r\n\r\nHe heard the crack of rifle shots a long way off. Raoul's men, pursuing\r\nBlack Hawk's scouts. Must more of his brothers die tonight?\r\n\r\nHe opened his eyes. It was now very dark; full night had fallen. He was\r\nlying on his left side in tall grass. He took a chance and raised his\r\nhead a little way. Raoul had said he wanted no men to stay behind, but\r\nthere might be someone about.\r\n\r\nHe dropped his head and tensed his hands and arms. The rope around his\r\nwrists had loosened. He could twist his wrists till the fingers of his\r\nright hand reached the knot. Pale eyes knew little about tying secure\r\nknots. After working patiently for a long time he freed his hands.\r\n\r\nHe still felt sick with grief, and did not have the strength to move\r\naway from this place where his comrades had died. Why not just lie here\r\nand wait for the long knives to come back and kill him?\r\n\r\nBut he thought of Redbird and Eagle Feather. And the fullness that had\r\nappeared in Redbird's belly before they crossed the Great River from\r\nIoway to Illinois. Using his knees and elbows to push himself through\r\nthe grass, he began to crawl.\r\n\r\nSlithering like a snake, his body and limbs flat to the ground, he\r\nwriggled along the edge of the creek till he felt sure any men that\r\nmight be nearby could not see him; then he slid down the embankment. The\r\nside of his head throbbed with every movement.\r\n\r\nHe crossed the creek on all fours, the rocks biting into his palms and\r\nknees. Where the swift, cold water was deepest he lowered his head into\r\nthe water to wash it. Agony exploded in his brain and he came close to\r\nfainting. But he forced the muscles of his neck to raise his head, and\r\nhis arms and legs to push him along, out of the creek.\r\n\r\nSoon he was in the shelter of the woods. He stood up and staggered\r\nthrough the shrubbery. Now that he was safer, the pain in his torn right\r\near pounded harder than ever.\r\n\r\nHe remembered that Raoul and his hundreds of mounted long knives had\r\nridden toward the place where Black Hawk, with only forty braves, was\r\nwaiting to learn how his peace emissaries fared.\r\n\r\nHe had stayed alive so far by luck, but he had no real hope of escaping\r\nto his people. Probably some of the long knives who had ridden out with\r\nRaoul would come across him, and that would be the end. As he neared the\r\nfarther edge of the woods, a newly risen half-moon, like a white wickiup\r\nin a black field, shone at him through the trees ahead.\r\n\r\nHe was about to step out on the prairie when he heard the rumble of\r\nhooves coming toward him. He stopped in the shelter of the trees. He\r\nheard shots, screams of pain and terror.\r\n\r\nAgainst the lighter prairie grass, men on horseback were dark shapes\r\nrushing at him from the horizon.\r\n\r\nTheir voices were high-pitched, fearful. They were crying out in\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\n\"Make a stand in the woods!\"\r\n\r\n\"No! There's too many of them!\"\r\n\r\n\"Just keep a-running. Follow the river.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear looked about for a hiding place. The moon showed him that he\r\nwas standing beside a big old oak, with branches low enough for him to\r\njump to.\r\n\r\n_Grandfather Oak, will you shelter me?_\r\n\r\nJust before he jumped for a branch he noticed that a hollow had rotted\r\nout in the base of the tree. It was big enough for him to hide in, but\r\nthen he would be on the same level as the militiamen. Safer up high.\r\n\r\nHe forced his tired legs to spring, managed to grip the lowest limb, one\r\nhand on each side of it, bark scratching his palms. He pressed the soles\r\nof his moccasins flat against the trunk and walked his body up, panting,\r\nuntil he was able to pull himself up over the limb and reach for the\r\nnext one. The branches were stout and close together, and soon he was\r\nhigh above the floor of the wood.\r\n\r\n_You made a ladder for me. Thank you, Grandfather Oak._\r\n\r\nDozens of mounted militiamen were streaming past his tree, galloping\r\nright under him. The hoofbeats of the horses and the shouts of the men\r\nto one another, pitched high with terror, shattered the night air.\r\n\r\nHe saw the black shapes of more horses and riders swimming through the\r\nprairie grass. Their elated cries were Sauk war whoops.\r\n\r\nThe braves of his tribe, racing toward him as if to rescue him. A sun\r\nrose in his breast.\r\n\r\nRifles boomed and arrows whistled through the air after the fleeing\r\nmilitiamen, and he was thankful that he was up this high. He heard\r\nscreams. Somewhere nearby a body crashed into shrubbery.\r\n\r\nSome long knives, he saw, were trying to go around the woods, but the\r\ngreater distance they had to travel gave the Sauk riders time to catch\r\nup with them. Rifle shots flashed like lightning in the darkness.\r\n\r\nTwo shadowy figures on foot, so close together they seemed one, stumbled\r\nout of the tall grass and pushed their way into the woods, careless of\r\nthe noise they were making. White Bear held his breath, hoping they\r\nwould not discover him above them.\r\n\r\nA voice below him said, \"You got to keep going. They'll catch you and\r\ntomahawk you sure.\"\r\n\r\nNow the two men were standing by the tree in which he had taken shelter.\r\nHe strained his ears to listen.\r\n\r\n\"Save yourself,\" said another voice, rasping with pain. \"I cannot run.\r\nThe arrow is under my kneecap. I will stay here and try to hold them\r\noff.\"\r\n\r\n_I know that voice, that accent. It is the Prussian, Otto Wegner._\r\n\r\nWhite Bear remembered how Wegner had disappointed him back at Raoul's\r\ncamp. Now his life was in danger; he deserved that.\r\n\r\n\"Hold them off? There's hunnerds of them.\" He'd heard the other man's\r\nvoice before, but he sounded like so many long knives, White Bear could\r\nnot be sure that he knew him.\r\n\r\n\"Well, maybe if I shoot a few of them, you can get away.\"\r\n\r\nAt that White Bear felt anger heating up in his chest. So Wegner would\r\nlike to shoot a few Indians, would he? Being willing to stay and fight\r\nwhile his comrade got away, though--that was worthy of respect.\r\n\r\n\"Damn! I don't like leaving you, Otto.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have a wife and children.\"\r\n\r\n\"So do you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you have a chance to get away. I don't. What good is it, two of us\r\ndead? Go!\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear heard a sigh. \"All right. Here's all my powder and shot. I\r\nain't planning to stop to use them. Remember, keep your head low so you\r\ncan see them above the horizon. If they ain't wearing hats, you can\r\nfigger they're Injuns.\"\r\n\r\n\"Please, Levi, my wife and my children, tell how I died.\"\r\n\r\nThat was who the other man was--Levi Pope, another of Raoul's men.\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell them you was brave. Make sure they don't catch you alive,\r\nOtto. You know what Injuns do to white people. Use your last bullet on\r\nyourself.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear felt his cheeks burn with shame. For himself, the idea of\r\ntorturing a prisoner was unthinkable, and he did not believe Black Hawk\r\nwould allow it. But he could not be sure. Many men and women of the\r\nBritish Band, he supposed, would enjoy making one of the dreaded long\r\nknives suffer.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear heard Pope scurry off through the brush while Wegner, gasping\r\nwith pain, settled himself in position at the base of the tree.\r\n\r\nThe boom of Wegner's rifle below him so startled White Bear that he\r\nalmost fell from his perch. He heard an agonized cry from out on the\r\nprairie, saw a brave fall from a horse.\r\n\r\n_He killed one of my brothers. I can't let this happen._\r\n\r\nHe heard quick, metallic sounds of clicking and scraping below him, the\r\nsounds of a man loading his rifle.\r\n\r\n_In a moment another Sauk warrior will fall._\r\n\r\nThe racking grief White Bear had felt since the deaths of Little Crow\r\nand Three Horses changed all at once into a whirlwind of rage. He\r\nremembered Little Crow, bound and helpless, his head blown apart. He\r\npictured Three Horses' body, torn by bullets. In his whole life up to\r\nnow he had never killed a man, but surely now, after what he had\r\nsuffered and seen, he had to kill.\r\n\r\n_Kill him how? He is armed and I am not._\r\n\r\nBut Wegner was in dire pain. White Bear could jump out of the tree on\r\nthe Prussian's back and bring his foot down hard on the knee with the\r\narrow in it. That should hurt Wegner enough to loosen his grip on his\r\nrifle, so that White Bear could get it away from him and shoot him with\r\nit or smash his skull.\r\n\r\nMore Sauk braves were riding closer, and Wegner must be taking aim in\r\nthe darkness down there. White Bear scrambled down the ladder of tree\r\nlimbs he had climbed.\r\n\r\nAs he reached the lowest limb, moonlight showed Wegner rolling over, his\r\neyes gleaming. The rifle barrel swung toward him.\r\n\r\n_He heard me._\r\n\r\nWhite Bear leaped.\r\n\r\nThe flash blinded him for an instant. In a suffocating cloud of powder\r\nsmoke he hit Wegner's chest with knees and hands, an impact that knocked\r\nthe breath from him. Wegner screamed in pain, a high, womanish sound\r\nthat made White Bear's ears ring more than the shot had.\r\n\r\nThe Prussian, under him, battered him with the rifle, trying to turn it\r\nso that he could hit him with the butt. White Bear had both hands on the\r\nstock, and tried to kick Wegner's knee as their bodies bucked and\r\nthrashed at the base of the oak.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear remembered that militiamen often carried hunting knives in\r\nshirt pockets. Gripping Wegner's rifle with one hand, he reached down\r\nthe front of the Prussian's leather jacket. Wegner's eyes widened in\r\nfear, and he thrust frantically with his rifle. White Bear felt the\r\nhandle of a knife and pulled it free. The broad steel blade twinkled,\r\nreflecting moon and stars.\r\n\r\nNow. One thrust into his enemy's throat.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear slid the point under the bandanna around Wegner's neck and\r\npressed it into the soft place just above the collarbone. The man's eyes\r\nseemed about to pop out of his head. His thick, dark mustache was drawn\r\nback from his clenched teeth.\r\n\r\nTrying to make himself kill the man, White Bear felt as sick in his\r\nstomach as he had when he was waiting for Raoul's bullet.\r\n\r\nAnd he remembered again, the night after Raoul had driven him out of\r\nVictoire and offered fifty pieces of eight for his death, what he had\r\nheard Otto Wegner say.\r\n\r\nHe did not push the knife any farther. But he realized that Wegner would\r\nstill kill him, given any chance. He held himself ready to strike.\r\n\r\n\"Drop your rifle,\" he whispered. \"Slide it away from you. Make a sudden\r\nmove and I'll cut your throat.\"\r\n\r\nWegner did as White Bear told him.\r\n\r\nHe said, \"You are keeping me alive to torture me.\"\r\n\r\nIf he brought Wegner back to the Sauk, White Bear thought, the warriors\r\nwould want to kill him slowly. Again he felt that hot shame.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know who I am?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"You are Raoul de Marion's nephew, Auguste. How can you be still alive?\r\nI saw Greenglove shoot you.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear ignored the question. \"Three of us came to you under a white\r\nflag to talk peace, and you shot us.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was wrong.\"\r\n\r\n\"You say that now, when I hold a knife on you. Why didn't you speak up\r\nthen?\"\r\n\r\n\"Colonel de Marion is my commanding officer. Kill me, damn you. Is it\r\nnot your duty?\"\r\n\r\n\"A warrior does as he pleases with his captives.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear heard all around him, on the prairie and in the woods, the\r\nwar cries and whistle signals of the Sauk braves. It would not be long\r\nbefore someone discovered White Bear crouched on top of this man,\r\nholding a knife point to his throat.\r\n\r\nWegner said, \"If I could, I would kill you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yet if you had caught me the night my uncle offered fifty Spanish\r\ndollars for my death, you would have let me go.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know that?\"\r\n\r\nIt amused him to answer Wegner's question by saying, \"I am a shaman--a\r\nmedicine man. We know things.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dummes Zeug,\" Wegner muttered. \"Rubbish,\" he said louder, but his eyes\r\nwavered.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear said, \"I am a healer. That is my work. I will not kill you\r\nunless I have to. Give me your word you will not attack me, and I will\r\ntake the knife from your throat.\"\r\n\r\nWegner closed his eyes and sighed. \"You are civilized. Maybe I can trust\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear could not help laughing. \"You saw today what civilized men do\r\nto their prisoners. You can trust me because I am a Sauk.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why do you trust me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I think you are a man of honor.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right. You have my word.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear slowly drew back and stood over Wegner. The Prussian sat up,\r\nthen groaned. In the moonlight White Bear saw tears streaming\r\nuncontrollably from his eyes. White Bear had him sit with his back to\r\nthe hollow tree. He brought his face close to the knee. With his eyes\r\nadjusted to the darkness, the half-moon's rays were enough to show him\r\nthat Wegner had broken off the end of the arrow, and the rest of it\r\nprotruded from his kneecap. The arrow had gone into the joint. It hurt\r\nWhite Bear just to look at it.\r\n\r\n\"I can try to pull this out,\" White Bear said.\r\n\r\n\"Go ahead.\"\r\n\r\n\"Give me that cloth around your neck.\"\r\n\r\nWith Wegner's bandanna White Bear wiped the blood off the arrow to make\r\nit less slippery. It would have been easier if Wegner had not broken the\r\narrow. The protruding end was only long enough to let White Bear grip it\r\nwith one hand. He wrapped his left hand around his right to give him a\r\ntighter grip, and pulled with all his strength.\r\n\r\nWegner fell over on his side in a faint.\r\n\r\n_Thank Earthmaker he didn't scream._\r\n\r\nThe arrow had not moved at all.\r\n\r\nWhen Wegner came around, White Bear said, \"There is nothing I can do for\r\nyou. You need to get back to your own people.\"\r\n\r\nWegner's eyes widened. \"You would let me go?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have to. Or else kill you. If our warriors got you I couldn't stop\r\nthem from killing you. Climb into this hollow in the tree and stay there\r\ntill morning. By then, I think, our braves will be far from here.\"\r\n\r\nHe helped Wegner to stand and boosted him up into his hiding place.\r\nWegner let out a groan as he drew his wounded leg inside the opening.\r\n\r\n_Take care of this pale eyes, Grandfather Oak._\r\n\r\n\"I will never forget this,\" said Wegner.\r\n\r\n\"Then remember my people.\"\r\n\r\nHe took Wegner's knife and rifle. He might have left the Prussian a\r\nweapon to defend himself, but he thought that would be going beyond\r\nkindness into foolishness.\r\n\r\nHe heard Sauk victory shouts coming from the other side of Old Man's\r\nCreek, where Raoul's camp had been. Little though he wanted to go back\r\nthere, it seemed the surest way to safety. Carrying the rifle with one\r\nhand, the knife in his belt, he made his way through the woods to the\r\ncreek.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSoon he was back in the center of what had been the long knives' camp,\r\nat the place where he had nearly been killed. A small fire burned here.\r\nNear it lay two bodies stretched out. The head of one was covered with a\r\ncloth. That, White Bear thought, must be Little Crow. Beside him lay\r\nThree Horses, a blanket draped over his short body, his face with its\r\nflattened nose uncovered. Standing around the bodies were half a dozen\r\nwarriors.\r\n\r\nBy all rights he ought to be lying there too. He put a hand up to his\r\near, forgotten in the excitement of the encounter with Otto Wegner. The\r\npain had settled to a dull pulsing. Gingerly, he felt the wound. The\r\nmiddle part of the ear was gone. The intact upper and lower parts were\r\ncovered with crusted blood. He had washed the wound once in the creek.\r\nHe must wash it again and bandage it.\r\n\r\n_Greenglove did that so blood would flow and it would seem to anyone who\r\nlooked at me in the twilight that I'd been shot in the head. He was\r\ntrying to save my life. Why?_\r\n\r\nOne day, White Bear hoped, he would meet Greenglove and find out why he\r\nhad spared him.\r\n\r\n_And that other time--when he hit me with his rifle just as Raoul was\r\nabout to shoot me--did he do that, too, to save my life?_\r\n\r\nA solitary warrior sat before the fire, a long scalplock adorned with\r\nfeathers hanging down the side of his head. The firelight gleamed on his\r\nshaven head and glittered on the beads around the rims of his ears. The\r\nbowl of the pipe he smoked was part of a steel tomahawk blade; the stem\r\nof the pipe was the tomahawk handle. He looked up, and his eyes widened\r\nwhen White Bear stepped into the firelight.\r\n\r\n\"White Bear!\" came Black Hawk's gravelly voice. \"Are you truly alive or\r\ndo you come back from the Trail of Souls?\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear felt an immense warmth as the firelight showed him Black\r\nHawk's teeth flashing in one of his rare smiles.\r\n\r\n\"I am alive,\" said White Bear.\r\n\r\n\"I am happy! I am surprised!\" Black Hawk cried, waving his pipe. \"I\r\nthought all three of you were dead.\"\r\n\r\nSudden elation dizzied White Bear, and the flesh of his back prickled as\r\nhe realized what it meant to see Black Hawk sitting quietly smoking his\r\npipe in the center of Raoul's camp. Victory! The long knives routed. How\r\nhad it happened? Black Hawk might have made a terrible mistake leading\r\nthe Sauk across the Great River, but at that moment White Bear loved\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nOwl Carver stepped out of the shadows carrying a bundle of goods he had\r\nbeen gathering from the tents of the long knives. He dropped his bundle\r\nto throw his arms around White Bear.\r\n\r\n\"My son is restored to me.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear sat down at the fire.\r\n\r\n\"How did you escape?\" Black Hawk asked.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear explained how he had played dead when Eli Greenglove claimed\r\nto have hit him. He said nothing about meeting Otto Wegner. He felt good\r\nabout having spared Wegner's life, but he was not sure Black Hawk would\r\nunderstand. In fact, White Bear was not sure he himself understood.\r\n\r\nOwl Carver made White Bear hold his head close to the firelight while he\r\nexamined the wound, muttering.\r\n\r\n\"Truly, the things the long knives do pass all understanding,\" he said.\r\n\"It was dark. You were in grass. Maybe he missed.\"\r\n\r\n\"He missed on purpose. He has great fame as a marksman; he sees very\r\nwell. He came and stood over me, and must have known I was alive.\"\r\n\r\nOwl Carver searched through his bundle of loot and found a Frenchman's\r\nkerchief and tied it around White Bear's head to protect the wounded\r\near.\r\n\r\nChills of exultation rippled up White Bear's spine as he looked around\r\nand saw Black Hawk's braves plundering the very camp where Raoul's men\r\nhad swarmed and had killed his two companions at sunset.\r\n\r\n\"Earthmaker has given us a mighty victory,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"We never expected it,\" said Owl Carver. \"We were camped on the Rock\r\nRiver north of here when Iron Knife rode in after sunset to say that you\r\nthree had been killed, and also two of the braves who had gone with him.\r\nHe told us that a whole army of long knives was riding toward us.\"\r\n\r\nBlack Hawk said, \"I was angry. They had killed my messengers of peace. I\r\ndid not care that there were hundreds of them and only forty of us. I\r\nwanted vengeance for the blood they had shed.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear laughed. \"I heard them crying out as they fled your attack.\r\nThey thought there were hundreds of _you_.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Hawk spirit flew with us, blinding them and striking fear into\r\ntheir hearts,\" said Black Hawk.\r\n\r\nOwl Carver said, \"And the spirits in their whiskey befuddled them too.\"\r\n\r\nBlack Hawk said, \"I was surprised to see them turn tail and run. I\r\nthought Americans were better shooters and fiercer fighters than that.\r\nThey outnumbered us many times over, but they showed no fight at all.\"\r\n\r\nThe Winnebago Prophet lumbered out of the darkness and sat down at the\r\nfireside opposite Black Hawk. The silver nose-ring lying against his\r\nmustache glittered red.\r\n\r\n\"It is well that you are here, Flying Cloud,\" said Black Hawk. \"We must\r\nlook along the trails that lie ahead of us.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear turned away in disgust. After the Winnebago Prophet had\r\nmisled Black Hawk so badly, how could he still rely on him?\r\n\r\nA gruff voice said, \"See, Father, I have lifted more hair from our\r\nenemies.\" White Bear looked up. Wolf Paw was standing over them, holding\r\nup two hanks of hair, each with a bloody, circular patch of flesh\r\nattached to it. White Bear hoped that one of those scalps did not belong\r\nto Otto Wegner.\r\n\r\nBlack Hawk stood up and seized Wolf Paw's shoulders. \"My heart is big\r\nwhen I see my son is so mighty a warrior.\"\r\n\r\nSitting down beside his father, Wolf Paw stared at White Bear, and White\r\nBear had to explain all over again how he came to be still alive.\r\n\r\nAfter a moment of silence Black Hawk spoke. \"Until tonight, there was no\r\nblood spilled between the long knives and us. But when we tried to\r\nsurrender, they shot our messengers.\" He gestured to the bodies near the\r\nfire and to White Bear. \"And now we have killed many of them.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear felt himself trembling with rage. He remembered Raoul coming\r\ntoward him, grinning, pistol raised--right on this spot--and he prayed\r\nthat now his uncle might be lying dead somewhere on the prairie. An\r\narrow in his back, killing him as he fled Black Hawk's warriors. A hole\r\nin his scalp, and his hair dangling from some brave's belt.\r\n\r\n_O Bear spirit, O Turtle, O Earthmaker, let it be so!_\r\n\r\nThen his fury faded away and became fear as he realized that he had just\r\ndone, in his mind, a thing more terrible than murder. A man might call\r\non the spirits for the strength and skill to fight an enemy--but to\r\ndirect the power of the spirits against another man, no matter how\r\nwicked, was forbidden. He prayed no harm would come to him because of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nBlack Hawk said, \"We have no choice now. The long knives have forced war\r\nupon me.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear spoke up quickly, before Wolf Paw or Flying Cloud could call\r\nfor war, as they were certain to do.\r\n\r\n\"It was my uncle, the brother of Star Arrow, who ordered us three to be\r\nkilled. He has hated our people all of his life. He especially hates me.\r\nA different long-knife war chief might have opened his arms to us. Now\r\nthat Black Hawk has shown the long knives that they will be hurt if they\r\ncome against us, let us offer peace again. I am ready to go again with a\r\nwhite flag to talk of surrender with other long-knife war chiefs.\"\r\n\r\nBlack Hawk made a flat, rejecting hand gesture. \"You have seen what\r\nhappened. Pale eyes warriors would not let you get close enough to talk\r\nto their chiefs.\"\r\n\r\nA warrior came over to the fire, holding a tin cup. He offered it to\r\nBlack Hawk.\r\n\r\n\"The long knives left five barrels of whiskey, but they are almost\r\nempty.\"\r\n\r\nBlack Hawk turned the cup over, letting the whiskey soak into the dirt.\r\n\r\n\"Pour that poison on the ground,\" he said. \"Whiskey made the long knives\r\nso foolish that when they looked at one of our braves they saw ten.\"\r\n\r\nWolf Paw said, \"They abandoned wagonloads of food and ammunition. Even\r\nsome rifles.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will need them,\" said Black Hawk. \"Without more provisions we cannot\r\ngo on.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the warrior went away, Black Hawk gave his pipe tomahawk to Wolf\r\nPaw to smoke. Owl Carver and the Winnebago Prophet brought out pipes of\r\ntheir own. Owl Carver offered his to White Bear, who declined it. Given\r\nwhat he had been through this day, and troubled by the fear that Black\r\nHawk was determined to plunge his people into worse calamities, White\r\nBear felt his stomach could not stand tobacco smoke.\r\n\r\nFlying Cloud broke the thoughtful silence. \"If forty Sauk warriors could\r\nchase away two hundred long knives, then all the Sauk warriors can chase\r\naway the long knives' whole army. I say call out the six hundred\r\nwarriors who wait at our main camp. We will drive the long knives all\r\nthe way back to the Great River.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear wanted to answer the Winnebago Prophet with angry words, but\r\nhe felt light-headed and nauseated. He decided to wait and see what the\r\nothers would say.\r\n\r\n\"The Prophet of the Winnebago speaks well,\" said Wolf Paw. \"My blade is\r\nhungry for more long knives' scalps.\"\r\n\r\n_Of course_, thought White Bear.\r\n\r\nOwl Carver said drily, \"We routed some drunk pale eyes who hardly\r\ndeserve to be called long knives. Let us not waste any more of our young\r\nmen's lives. Let us follow the northward curve of the Rock River to its\r\nvery headwaters, far beyond any pale eyes' settlements, then travel\r\nwestward toward the Great River. If we can cross the Great River safely,\r\nI do not think the long knives will chase us farther.\"\r\n\r\nThe five men sat in silence. A sudden thought struck White Bear. _This_\r\nwas why Earthmaker had ordained that he be educated among the pale\r\neyes--so that he could help his band understand how pale eyes thought.\r\nIf they kept going north along the Rock River they would soon cross the\r\nnorthern border of the state of Illinois. That might seem to them to\r\nmean very little, but it could mean much to their pursuers. The country\r\nwhere they were headed did not belong to any state; it was part of a\r\nlarge land of many waters that was called the Michigan Territory.\r\n\r\nEagerly he said, \"We may be able to escape the long knives by going\r\nnorth. Most of the long knives who are pursuing us were called out by\r\nthe Great Father of the Illinois country. Once we are out of Illinois,\r\nmaybe they will not follow.\"\r\n\r\nWolf Paw grunted, clearly insulted at the thought of their not being\r\npursued.\r\n\r\nThe Prophet bestirred himself. \"Many of my Winnebago brothers dwell in\r\nthat country to the north. They will join us in fighting the long\r\nknives.\"\r\n\r\n_Like your people from Prophet's Town, who've been deserting us?_ White\r\nBear thought.\r\n\r\nA warrior set a long knives' saddlebag before Black Hawk, who opened it.\r\nThe war chief pulled out an expensive-looking black wool suit and some\r\nwhite silk shirts with ruffles. Finally he took out two books bound in\r\nred and white leather. White Bear leaned over for a closer look.\r\n\r\n\"Bundles of the pale eyes' talking paper,\" said Black Hawk.\r\n\r\nWolf Paw said, \"They are worthless, Father. Keep the clothing and put\r\nthe talking paper on the fire.\"\r\n\r\nBut Black Hawk handed one of the books to White Bear. \"What do the\r\ntalking papers say to you, White Bear?\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear picked up a book and read on the spine, _Chitty's Pleadings,\r\nVol. I_. He opened and saw close-packed type, his eyes skimming over\r\nmany legal terms in Latin. White Bear wondered whether the lawyer who\r\nowned these books was still alive. At the sight of books his heart gave\r\nan unexpected lurch. He felt a longing to be not in a plundered enemy\r\ncamp on the prairie, but in a library, with books, pen and paper. The\r\nfeeling took him by surprise. It had been many months since he had\r\nmissed the pale eyes' world. A few pages of _Paradise Lost_ now and then\r\nhad satisfied any hankering for what they called \"civilization.\"\r\n\r\n\"These papers tell about the pale eyes' laws,\" he said. \"It is sometimes\r\nsaid that they have no magic. But there is powerful magic in their books\r\nand in their laws. It is the magic that binds them together.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prophet said, \"The pale eyes' paper is bad medicine.\"\r\n\r\nBlack Hawk held out his hand, and White Bear gave him the book. It\r\npained White Bear to think Black Hawk might throw it into the fire.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear had seen many white leaders--mayors, congressmen, military\r\nofficers, once even Sharp Knife himself, Andrew Jackson, the President\r\nof the United States. He had learned about them in school and read about\r\nthem in newspapers. He felt Black Hawk was a match for any of them. More\r\nthan a match in some ways; he was stronger and healthier than any white\r\nman his age that White Bear had known. What pale eyes of nearly seventy\r\nyears could personally lead a cavalry charge against an enemy\r\noutnumbering him by ten to one and rout them? Black Hawk's great\r\nweakness was one that he shared with most people, whatever their race or\r\ntheir position in life: if he wanted a thing to be true, he believed it.\r\nThat was why last winter he had listened to the Winnebago Prophet and\r\nnot to White Bear.\r\n\r\nNow White Bear hoped Black Hawk would show his intelligence by\r\nrespecting the value of the book. Black Hawk frowned at the\r\nleather-bound volume, weighing it in his hand. He picked the other book\r\nup with his other hand.\r\n\r\n\"They are heavy. But since there is magic in them, I will keep these\r\ntalking-paper bundles by me. And I will bring them with me when I speak\r\nin council.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear breathed a small sigh of satisfaction.\r\n\r\nBlack Hawk laid the books down, one on each side of him, and put one\r\nhand on each book. He sat like that for a time, staring into the fire.\r\n\r\n\"I have done with trying to surrender to the long knives,\" he said, and\r\nit seemed to White Bear that his face became a fearsome mask in the\r\nfirelight. \"They have left me no choice. Yes, we will retreat from them.\r\nBut we will not run like hunted deer. We will send out war parties, big\r\nand small, in every direction. We will lie in ambush on every trail. We\r\nwill fall upon every settlement. We will attack every traveling party of\r\nlong knives. No pale eyes north of the Rock River will be safe from us.\r\nUntil we have crossed the Great River, we will give the pale eyes no\r\npeace.\"\r\n\r\nAt Black Hawk's words White Bear felt that an ice-cold hand had laid\r\nitself flat on his back, between his shoulder blades. With those words\r\nBlack Hawk was condemning to cruel death hundreds of people--pale eyes\r\nand his own.\r\n\r\nAnd one of the largest settlements north of the Rock River was Victor.\r\n\r\n\"What is the use of more killing?\" he said. \"It will only madden the\r\nlong knives. They will come after us till they have destroyed us.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have decided,\" Black Hawk said. \"We must fight back. We must be\r\navenged. They stole our land. They burned Saukenuk. They burned\r\nProphet's Town. We asked them for peace, and they killed us. Black Hawk\r\nwill show them that they cannot do this and go unpunished.\"\r\n\r\n\"So it shall be!\" the Winnebago Prophet growled.\r\n\r\n_And after that the long knives in their turn will have to be avenged._\r\n\r\nHopelessness lay like a heavy sodden blanket on White Bear. He saw the\r\nold warrior's determination, and said no more.\r\n\r\nHe could only pray that Earthmaker spare those he loved. On both sides.\r\n\r\nBlack Hawk stood up. \"Let us go back to our camp.\"\r\n\r\nWolf Paw said, \"Father, I want to stay here till tomorrow with a party\r\nof warriors. There are dead long knives scattered all over the prairie,\r\nbut we cannot find them in the dark. In the morning we can take their\r\nscalps and their weapons.\"\r\n\r\nHis words stopped White Bear as he was about to turn away from the fire.\r\nOtto Wegner might still be hiding in that hollow tree, waiting for dawn.\r\n\r\nHurriedly, White Bear said, \"I, too, will stay. I will help Wolf Paw\r\nsearch for the dead.\"\r\n\r\nWhat could he do if Wolf Paw and his men captured Wegner? Perhaps not\r\nsave the Prussian's life, but at least persuade the warriors to kill him\r\ncleanly and not torture him.\r\n\r\n_Haven't I done enough for Wegner? I want to go back to Redbird._\r\n\r\nBut his impulses were a shaman's impulses, and the harder to explain\r\nthey were, the more he trusted them. It was important, for some reason,\r\nthat he stay at Old Man's Creek a while longer.\r\n\r\nOwl Carver looked surprised. \"After all you have suffered, do you not\r\nwant to return to your family?\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear thought quickly. \"There is a chance that murdering uncle of\r\nmine is one of those lying on the ground somewhere around here. It would\r\nbe good to see him dead.\"\r\n\r\nOwl Carver grunted. \"I will tell Redbird that you are safe.\"\r\n\r\nFear and exertion had exhausted White Bear beyond ordinary fatigue, and\r\nhe had barely enough energy now to roll himself in a blanket by the\r\nsmall fire. Unconsciousness hit him instantly.\r\n\r\nIn the morning he watched, sickened, as Wolf Paw not only scalped a long\r\nknife who lay dead in the tall grass, but slashed open the man's woollen\r\ntrousers and sliced off his manly parts. Blood spattered over innocent\r\nprairie flowers of violet and yellow, and a swarm of flies buzzed around\r\nWolf Paw, waiting to settle on the dead man when he moved away.\r\n\r\n\"Why do you do that?\" White Bear demanded. \"The Sauk have never done\r\nsuch things to a dead enemy before.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Winnebago Prophet says that the long knives are planning to kill\r\nall Sauk men, and then bring up black men from the country to the south\r\nto mate with our women. That way they hope to breed a race of slaves.\r\nThis is our answer to that.\"\r\n\r\nThe story sounded absurd to White Bear. The pale eyes in Illinois didn't\r\neven keep black slaves. Just more of the Winnebago Prophet's babblings.\r\nBut Wolf Paw firmly believed it.\r\n\r\nAt a sudden drumming of hooves, Wolf Paw and White Bear both looked\r\nsouth at Old Man's Creek. A Sauk warrior splashed through, waving his\r\narm.\r\n\r\n\"Long knives coming!\" he shouted.\r\n\r\nWolf Paw picked up two rifles, his own and the dead man's. They had\r\nfound eleven bodies scattered along the edge of the Rock River, none of\r\nthem Raoul's.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear was disappointed, but not surprised, that Raoul had managed\r\nto escape. Surely he deserved killing more than any of his followers who\r\ndid die. But White Bear had not stayed behind just to see Raoul dead.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it was a relief that the spirits had not answered White Bear's\r\nforbidden prayer.\r\n\r\nHe kept looking for movement out of the corner of his eye, trying to see\r\nwhether Otto Wegner was anywhere about. But he saw no sign of him.\r\n\r\n\"How many long knives?\" Wolf Paw said to the scout as he rode up. \"Can\r\nwe fight them?\"\r\n\r\nThe scout's hand slashed a no. \"Too many. Fifty at least. All on\r\nhorseback. And they have a wagon with them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Coming to collect their dead,\" said Wolf Paw. \"They will not like what\r\nthey find.\" He grinned down at the corpse he had just carved.\r\n\r\n\"Better mount up and ride away from here,\" said the scout. \"If they see\r\nus, they will chase us.\"\r\n\r\n\"They will not chase us,\" said Wolf Paw. \"They will be afraid of an\r\nambush.\" His smile broadened. \"Maybe we will give them one.\"\r\n\r\nAt Wolf Paw's shouted command the six warriors who had remained with him\r\nmoved into the trees north of Old Man's Creek, the same trees where\r\nWhite Bear had taken refuge last night. White Bear tried to see the\r\ntree where he had hidden Wegner, but the woods looked different in\r\ndaylight.\r\n\r\nWolf Paw ordered his party to mount their horses, tied up amidst the\r\ntrees, and ride north to Black Hawk's camp. But though he swung into the\r\nsaddle, he did not ride off with them. He sat on his white-spotted gray\r\npony facing the direction the long knives would be coming from. A screen\r\nof low-hanging maple branches and wild grape vines concealed him. White\r\nBear, on a brown mare captured in Raoul's camp last night, drew up\r\nbeside him.\r\n\r\n\"Why are you staying?\" White Bear asked.\r\n\r\n\"I counted only eleven dead long knives,\" said Wolf Paw. \"I want to make\r\nit twelve.\" He put the hammer of his flintlock on half-cock, poured\r\nfine-grained priming powder on the pan from a small flask, and closed\r\nthe fizzen over it.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear sensed that something very important was about to happen and\r\nthat he must wait with Wolf Paw.\r\n\r\n\"Why do _you_ wait?\" Wolf Paw demanded. \"You have never killed anyone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here they come,\" said White Bear, choosing not to answer him.\r\n\r\nThe two horses pulling the wagon, a flatbed with railed sides, halted at\r\nthe creek. Most of the long knives dismounted and began to search\r\nthrough the remains of Raoul's camp. A few others rode across the creek.\r\nWolf Paw raised his rifle.\r\n\r\nThe long knives cried out to one another and cursed as they found the\r\nmutilated bodies of their comrades.\r\n\r\n_Now they hate us more._\r\n\r\nThe long knives had rolled-up blankets tied across their horses' backs.\r\nThey opened the blankets and used them to pick up the dead. One pair of\r\nmen on foot was already carrying a blanket-wrapped body across the creek\r\nto the wagon.\r\n\r\nOne long knife rode slowly toward them. He was so tall that his legs\r\ndangled down from his horse almost to the ground. He came to the body\r\nWolf Paw had just been stripping, and climbed down. He took off his\r\nbroad-brimmed gray hat and stood holding it in both hands as he looked\r\ndown at the body.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear heard the click of a flintlock hammer being drawn back to\r\nfull-cock. Wolf Paw sighted along the barrel.\r\n\r\nThe militiaman raised his head, and White Bear saw tears glistening in\r\nthe morning sun as they ran down his cheeks.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear knew this man.\r\n\r\nA gaunt brown face with strong bones, deep-set gray eyes, a young face\r\naged by grief. In White Bear's vision of last winter this man had a\r\nblack beard; now he was clean-shaven. But this was the man the Turtle\r\nhad shown him.\r\n\r\nA sudden shout from the woods made both White Bear and Wolf Paw jump\r\nwith surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Help! Help me, please!\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear saw Otto Wegner stagger from the trees about a hundred feet\r\nto his right. He was trying to run toward the tall man.\r\n\r\nHe limped badly and let out an \"Oh!\" of pain with every step.\r\n\r\nThe tall man set his hat back on his head and ran toward the Prussian,\r\nwho fell forward on his face in the grass a short distance from the edge\r\nof the woods.\r\n\r\nWolf Paw swung the rifle toward Otto, but before he could fire, Otto\r\nfell and was almost obscured by the tall grass. The blue-black rifle\r\nbarrel lifted toward the man going to his aid. White Bear heard Wolf Paw\r\ndraw a deep breath through his nostrils and saw his finger tighten on\r\nthe trigger.\r\n\r\nEven as the hammer fell and the spark set the powder sizzling in the\r\npan, White Bear thrust his hand out. In the instant between the pulling\r\nof the trigger and the firing of the rifle White Bear pushed the barrel\r\noff target.\r\n\r\nThe rifle went off with a boom and a flash and a puff of blue smoke.\r\n\r\nThe lanky man jerked his head around and stared into the trees where\r\nWolf Paw and White Bear sat hidden on their horses. He shouted and\r\npointed. The long knives spread out between the creek and the woods\r\nbrought their rifles to their shoulders. Some of them jumped on their\r\nhorses.\r\n\r\n\"_Why did you do that?_\" Wolf Paw shouted. It no longer mattered that\r\nthe long knives could hear him.\r\n\r\nHe raised his rifle as if to hit White Bear with the butt end, as Eli\r\nGreenglove had done many moons ago.\r\n\r\n\"Come on,\" said White Bear, ignoring the threat and kicking his horse's\r\nsides to start him galloping through the woods. Wolf Paw, who had no\r\ntime to reload, thundered behind him, uttering shouts of inarticulate\r\nrage.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear was certain Wolf Paw would strike at him with rifle butt or\r\ntomahawk or knife before they cleared the woods, but Wolf Paw was wholly\r\nbent now on escape.\r\n\r\n_Now I understand!_\r\n\r\nThe realization hit White Bear so suddenly and surprisingly that he sat\r\nup in his saddle. A tree limb flying toward him nearly hit him in the\r\nface. He ducked under it at the last moment.\r\n\r\nThis was why he had wanted to stay behind with Wolf Paw, even at the\r\ncost of delaying his reunion with Redbird, even at the risk of his life.\r\nIt was not just to protect Otto Wegner. The Turtle--or perhaps even\r\nEarthmaker himself--had ordained it. If he had not been there Wolf Paw\r\nwould have killed that tall, thin man who came to bury his fallen\r\ncomrades.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear remembered the rest of his vision--hundreds of blue-coated\r\nlong knives charging and dying. Would this man send those long knives or\r\ntheir enemy into battle?\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to puzzle out. He might never know the answer.\r\n\r\nThey rode over the prairie on the other side of the woods, heading for\r\nBlack Hawk's camp. The long knives following them had dropped away,\r\ndoubtless afraid, as Wolf Paw had predicted, of an ambush.\r\n\r\nStill expecting to feel a tomahawk blade split his spine, White Bear\r\nslowed down.\r\n\r\n\"So!\" Wolf Paw shouted. \"You are still a pale eyes!\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" White Bear tried to explain. \"It was a vision I had. I had to save\r\nthat man.\"\r\n\r\n\"A vision,\" Wolf Paw sneered. \"I should kill you. If you were not a\r\nshaman-- A warrior needs all his luck. But, since your pale eyes people\r\nare so precious to you, I will kill _them_. You heard what my father\r\nsaid. I will lead the war party that goes to your pale eyes' home. And\r\nthis time you will not be along to save anyone.\"\r\n\r\nThey spoke no more. Though the morning sky was bright, a cloud of dread\r\nsettled over White Bear. What would become of Nicole, Grandpapa, Frank\r\nand all the people of Victoire and Victor who had been his friends? At\r\nthe prompting of some spirit, he had saved the tall, thin man, a\r\nstranger to him. And he had saved Otto Wegner, one of Raoul's hired men.\r\n\r\nWas there _nothing_ he could do for his own loved ones?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n15\r\n\r\nThe Blockhouse\r\n\r\n\r\nThe devil's reek of gunpowder seared Nicole's nostrils. Arrows flew over\r\nthe trading post palisade to fall in the courtyard, some quivering\r\nupright in the ground. She heard the piercing shrieks of the Indians\r\nabove the steady crackling of rifle fire.\r\n\r\nShe stood in the open doorway of the blockhouse, her body tense with\r\nfear as she watched Frank, up on the catwalk above the main gate. He\r\ncrouched behind the pointed logs of the palisade. Frowning with\r\nconcentration, he was slowly reloading his rifle.\r\n\r\n\"Look at Frank up there,\" Nicole said to Pamela Russell, who stood\r\nbeside her. \"Oh, God, I hate to see him out in the open. Frank,\" she\r\nsaid, though she knew he couldn't hear her, \"get into one of the\r\ntowers!\"\r\n\r\n\"Burke too,\" Pamela said. \"Why do they do it?\" She pointed to the east\r\nside of the palisade where her husband, a stocky man wearing spectacles,\r\nstood on the catwalk. With the Indians attacking the front gate, he was\r\nleft alone to guard the east parapet. The rest of the men, ten of them,\r\nwere at the front part of the palisades, banging away.\r\n\r\n_Twelve men. Twelve men who know how to use rifles. That's all we've\r\ngot._\r\n\r\nAnd four were Nicole's husband, two of her sons and her father.\r\n\r\nShe gasped.\r\n\r\nShe saw a loop of rope fly through the air above the eastern wall and\r\ncatch on one of the sharpened logs. A moment later a dark head crowned\r\nwith feathers appeared above the palisade. And Burke Russell was looking\r\nthe other way.\r\n\r\n\"Burke, look out!\" Pamela screamed.\r\n\r\nBurke heard that. He swung around, raising his rifle to his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Please, God!\" Nicole cried.\r\n\r\nThe Indian leaped over the parapet. He seemed twice as tall as Burke,\r\nwith bulging muscles that gleamed with oil. He wore only a loincloth,\r\nand his walnut-brown body was painted with red, yellow and black\r\nstripes. His scalplock flew out behind him as he rushed Burke, swinging\r\na war club with a glittering metal spike protruding from its thick end.\r\n\r\nBurke's rifle went off with an orange flash, a boom, a cloud of smoke.\r\n\r\nThe Indian wasn't stopped. The war club came down on Burke's head.\r\nNicole heard the hollow thud and heard herself cry out.\r\n\r\nPamela screamed. \"Oh, no, oh God, no! Burke! Burke!\"\r\n\r\nBurke's glasses flew from his face, hit the catwalk and caromed off to\r\nthe ground. With his free hand the Indian giant seized the rifle as\r\nBurke crumpled. He raised both arms over his head, rifle in one hand,\r\nbloodstained club in the other, and shouted his triumph.\r\n\r\nNicole's stomach heaved.\r\n\r\nPamela fell against her, fainting. She threw an arm around Pamela and\r\neased her to the ground, and she saw half a dozen more Indians waving\r\nrifles and tomahawks leap over the eastern parapet and land on the\r\ncatwalk near Burke Russell's body.\r\n\r\n\"Frank! Behind you!\" she screamed.\r\n\r\nFrank turned, took aim and fired at the Indians. He ran for the nearest\r\ncorner tower.\r\n\r\nNicole didn't see whether he hit any of the Indians. She dragged Pamela\r\nout of the doorway with the help of Ellen Slattery, the blacksmith's\r\nwife. They got Pamela sitting on a bench by the wall. Her thick chestnut\r\nhair tumbled forward as Nicole pushed her head down to revive her.\r\n\r\n_I don't know why I'm doing this. It's a mercy she's unconscious._\r\n\r\n_Frank!_\r\n\r\nHer heart in her throat, Nicole pushed herself to her feet and ran back\r\nto the door. An arrow whizzed through the open doorway. It clanged off\r\nthe iron muzzle of the cannon that stood in the center of the blockhouse\r\nhall.\r\n\r\n_I'd make a mighty big target for those Indians_, she thought, the wry\r\nlittle joke helping to keep her from crying in her terror.\r\n\r\nShe peered around the edge of the doorway to see a fury of brown bodies\r\non the southern catwalk where Frank had been standing. In the center of\r\nthe catwalk, one brave with a rooster's comb of red-dyed hair shouted\r\nand brandished a steel-headed tomahawk, sending parties to hammer at the\r\ndoors of the corner towers with clubs, tomahawks and rifle butts. Black\r\nrings painted around his eyes and yellow slashes on his cheekbones gave\r\nhim a terrifying look.\r\n\r\nEven in the midst of her fear and hatred she could see that his body was\r\nmagnificent. The most beautiful man's body she'd ever seen.\r\n\r\nTo her relief Nicole saw no dead white men anywhere--except for Burke\r\nRussell, who lay still, his head a bright red mess, one arm hanging down\r\nover the edge of the eastern catwalk. She looked at him quickly and then\r\nlooked away, feeling sick again.\r\n\r\nWhat made it even more of a shame that Burke had died on the palisade\r\nwas that the men never planned to hold it. They just wanted to delay the\r\nIndians a bit. Here in the blockhouse was where they hoped to be able to\r\nhold out.\r\n\r\nWith God's help.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Burke! Oh, my Burke!\" Pamela Russell was awake and screaming. Ellen\r\nSlattery looked helplessly at Nicole.\r\n\r\nNicole felt heartbroken for Pamela, but she had to let her be. There was\r\ntoo much to do. She ran through the people crowded into the main room on\r\nthe ground floor of the blockhouse. There must be four hundred people\r\nhere, mostly women and children, she thought.\r\n\r\n_And Raoul's got over a hundred men from Victor with him. God knows\r\nwhere._\r\n\r\nHere they had more rifles than men. Two dozen rifles leaned against the\r\nstone wall. Many families owned two or three rifles, and people had\r\ngrabbed them as they fled to the trading post.\r\n\r\n_Well, a woman can ram a ball down a muzzle and pull a trigger too._\r\n\r\nAnd miss, she thought, her heart a ball of ice. She hadn't seen one\r\nIndian hit yet.\r\n\r\nNicole spoke loudly to the women around her. \"The Indians will be\r\nshooting down from the catwalk at our men when they try to get back here\r\nto us.\" She started to load a rifle. \"We've got to shoot at the Indians\r\nand drive them to cover.\"\r\n\r\nShe had not held a rifle in her hands since marrying Frank, who would\r\nnot have a firearm in the house. But Elysée de Marion had taught his\r\ndaughter how to shoot, and she had not forgotten.\r\n\r\nPiled by the rifles were flannel bags, powder horns and five small\r\nbarrels, all full of gunpowder. In that frantic dawn, after fleeing\r\nhere, the men and women had formed a relay line to rush the bags and\r\nbarrels of gunpowder from Raoul's stone magazine to the blockhouse.\r\n\r\nFeeling a bit more hopeful, Nicole noticed lead ingots lying beside the\r\nammunition--probably from the lead mine that Raoul had shut down just\r\nbefore leaving Victor. And she saw scissor-shaped bullet molds. They had\r\nsome of the things they needed.\r\n\r\nIf only they knew how to use these things.\r\n\r\n\"Who knows how to mold bullets?\" she asked the group of women who'd been\r\nstanding silently, watching her.\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" Elfrida Wegner said. Of course, thought Nicole. Her husband\r\nhad been a soldier, over in Europe.\r\n\r\n\"Take some others and show them how to do it,\" Nicole said. \"We're going\r\nto need all the bullets we can make.\"\r\n\r\nElfrida and two other women carried the lead bars and the molds to the\r\nhuge fireplace at the rear of the hall.\r\n\r\nFrom the hundred and more women crowded into the hall Nicole collected\r\nten volunteers who knew something about rifles, five to shoot and five\r\nto load.\r\n\r\nShe called two of the bigger boys to carry baskets of shot upstairs. But\r\ncarrying powder--that was dangerous. She couldn't make herself ask\r\nanyone else to do that.\r\n\r\nShe filled a bushel basket with sacks of cartridges, added a powder horn\r\non top, swung it up to her shoulder and charged up the stairs, terrified\r\nall the way.\r\n\r\n\"Judas Priest, you're _strong_, Missuz Hopkins,\" said one of the boys\r\ncarrying shot. It gave her a warm feeling to hear that; she figured most\r\npeople thought of her as just plain fat.\r\n\r\nShe still couldn't believe she was going to do this. Going to try to\r\nkill people. She picked out a slot in the log wall and pushed her rifle\r\nbarrel through it. She could see a bit of the courtyard below. White men\r\nwere falling back from the towers. Indians were coming at them. All of\r\nthem were moving slowly. White men backing up a step at a time. Indians\r\nmatching them step for step. A dance. The brave with the red crest was\r\nstill standing on the catwalk above the front gate, waving his tomahawk\r\nand shouting orders. The caller.\r\n\r\nNicole pulled open the drawstring of a bag of cartridges, bit off the\r\nend of a paper cartridge and poured the black powder down the muzzle of\r\nher rifle. She detached the ramrod from the stock of the rifle and\r\nwrapped a bullet in greased cloth, ramming it into place down the tight,\r\nrifled barrel. She thanked Heaven she hadn't forgotten how to do this.\r\n\r\nShe dropped the fine grains of priming powder from the horn into the\r\npowder pan, pointed her rifle at the red-crested brave and sighted down\r\nthe black barrel at the center of his chest.\r\n\r\nHer finger quivered on the trigger. She couldn't kill a man. Her eyes\r\nblurred.\r\n\r\nIf she didn't kill him, he might kill Frank. Or Tom or Ben. Or Papa. She\r\nremembered Burke Russell's smashed, bloody skull.\r\n\r\nShe had to do it. Her vision cleared.\r\n\r\nShe took deep breaths, steadying herself.\r\n\r\nShe heard the click of the hammer as she pulled back the trigger. The\r\nhammer snapped forward, the flint hit the fizzen, the spark struck the\r\npowder pan. The rifle went off with a thunderclap that made her ears\r\nring, and her target was obscured by cream-colored smoke in front of the\r\nrifle port.\r\n\r\nWhen the smoke cleared, the brave was still standing on the catwalk.\r\n\r\nShe clenched her fist and whispered, \"Damn!\"\r\n\r\nThe red-crested Indian glanced down to his right, as if he had heard a\r\nbullet strike the palisade wall there, then looked straight at her. She\r\nknew he couldn't really see her. She was hidden behind a log wall, and a\r\nhundred feet or more separated them. Even so, it seemed to her that his\r\nmalevolent stare met her eyes.\r\n\r\nShe handed her rifle back to Bernadette Bosquet, a cook from the\r\nchâteau, who gave her a loaded one.\r\n\r\nDown in the yard, the Indians were charging the fur shop and the inn.\r\nThe white men, retreating, were converging on the front door of the\r\nblockhouse.\r\n\r\nShe saw Elysée and Guichard emerge from behind the inn. The two old men\r\nmoved slowly, Elysée limping heavily, both walking backward. Guichard\r\nfired a shot at the six or more crouching Indians coming at them.\r\nElysée, his walking stick in his left hand, raised his pistol. Guichard\r\nworked quickly with powder horn and ramrod to load his rifle. Elysée\r\nfired, bringing down one of the Indians. Both men took a few steps\r\nbackward as powder smoke enveloped their attackers. The Indians darted\r\nforward, and Guichard raised his rifle. The Indians hesitated. Elysée\r\nstepped behind Guichard and tucked his stick under one arm to reload his\r\npistol. At a word from Elysée, Guichard fired, and a red man with a\r\nrifle crumpled. Guichard, reaching for his powder horn, stepped backward\r\nbehind Elysée, who now kept the Indians covered.\r\n\r\nNicole felt her legs tremble and a lump form in her throat as she\r\nwatched the fearless precision with which her father and his lifelong\r\nservant carried out their retreat. Those two old men shouldn't have to\r\nfight at all, but today every man was needed.\r\n\r\nShe saw Frank and her two oldest sons, Tom and Ben, running across the\r\nyard to the front door. They vanished under the overhang of the\r\nblockhouse's second story, made of logs. Thank God they'd made it to\r\nsafety! She felt faint and took a deep breath.\r\n\r\nShe handed her rifle to Bernadette. \"Here, you shoot. I've got to see my\r\nhusband and sons.\"\r\n\r\n\"Merci, madame. I thought you'd never give me a turn.\"\r\n\r\nBy the time Nicole got downstairs, Frank and the other men had crowded\r\ninto the hall. The heavy front door of the blockhouse was shut and\r\nbarred, throwing the stone-walled lower floor into near-darkness. Two\r\nmen were shooting through the rifle ports on either side of the door.\r\nWomen were lighting oil lamps and candles and setting them on shelves\r\naround the edges of the room.\r\n\r\nWomen whose men were here were holding them tight. Nicole threw her arms\r\naround Frank, then opened them wider to take in Tom and Ben as they ran\r\nto join their mother and father.\r\n\r\nShe eyed the boys. Their faces were rosy and their eyes bright with\r\nexcitement. They'd be men in another year or two. And after today, she\r\nthought, Frank would have a hard time keeping them away from rifles.\r\n\r\n_If we live through this day._\r\n\r\nAs she felt Frank strong and alive against her, a sudden intense desire\r\nto make love to him came over her. She was shocked at herself.\r\n\r\nBut she'd seen one man struck down already and knew that before sundown\r\nshe or Frank might be dead. The realization of how precious Frank was to\r\nher had brought her body to passionate life.\r\n\r\nShe heard the shrieks and yips of the Indians in the yard of the trading\r\npost.\r\n\r\nHard-eyed David Cooper said, \"We can't hold 'em off just shooting from\r\nthe ground floor. We need shooters at every rifle port upstairs.\"\r\n\r\nHe nodded approvingly when he saw Elfrida Wegner and three other women\r\nmolding bullets by the fire they had just kindled.\r\n\r\nHe called, \"All right, four men and four of you women take rifle ports\r\ndown here. The rest of you come up to the second story.\"\r\n\r\nGathering up extra rifles, five men and thirty or more women followed\r\nCooper upstairs, where he organized them to shoot, each shooter to have\r\nsomeone to reload and carry ammunition.\r\n\r\nNicole might herself have volunteered to shoot through one of the\r\nupstairs rifle ports, but she chose to load for Frank. She felt it might\r\nbe important to Frank that he be the one to shoot and she stand by,\r\nhelping him. She would rather be at his side, anyway, than across the\r\nroom somewhere shooting.\r\n\r\nFrank pushed his octagonal rifle barrel out through his port. The port\r\nwas only about six inches wide and three inches high, and the log wall\r\nwas a foot thick or more, but Nicole still trembled at the thought that\r\nan Indian might manage to hit Frank with an arrow or a bullet. Working\r\nto load his second rifle, she tried not to think about that.\r\n\r\nThank God they had David Cooper here, someone who seemed to know what to\r\ndo. She remembered how Cooper had spoken up the day Raoul had forced\r\nAuguste out of the château-- _Is this how you do things in Smith\r\nCounty?_ It was Cooper who had thrown open the trading post to the first\r\nrefugees from the Indian raid, people from Victoire, shortly after dawn.\r\nHe and Burke Russell. Burke. Her heart sank.\r\n\r\nNicole's fears turned to Victoire and to the outlying farms. The Indians\r\nhad attacked so suddenly, whooping on horseback across the prairie, that\r\nthere was just time for the people in Victor and some from the château\r\nto crowd into the trading post. Many of the children and some of the\r\nwomen gathered into the main room were still in their nightgowns. But\r\nmissing from the crowd downstairs were people Nicole knew. Reverend\r\nPhilip Hale and Nancy Hale, Clarissa Greenglove and her two sons by\r\nRaoul, Marchette Perrault, many others. Fear twisted her belly as she\r\nthought of what the Indians might have done to them.\r\n\r\nCooper had assigned himself to a gunport in the east wall of the\r\nblockhouse. Nicole went to him.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Cooper, could I have a look out there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, ma'am.\" He sighed. \"That used to be your home, that mansion\r\non the hill, didn't it?\"\r\n\r\nPoor Burke Russell, she saw, was still lying on the eastern catwalk.\r\nThree dead Indians were sprawled there now to keep him company, though.\r\nShe was a bit more hardened to such sights than she had been just a\r\nshort time ago. But what she saw in the cheerful June sky beyond the\r\npalisade made her body go clammy-cold with horror.\r\n\r\nA rope of thick, black smoke coiled upward, twisting this way and that,\r\nspreading till it seemed to stain the entire eastern quarter of the sky.\r\nThe palisade was too high for her to see the fire itself, though red\r\ntongues of flame shot up now and again in the midst of the smoke. But\r\nshe had no doubt at all about where the fire was.\r\n\r\n\"They're burning Victoire!\" She started to cry.\r\n\r\nShe felt Frank's hand patting her shoulder, and turned.\r\n\r\n\"I was hoping the people of Victoire might be able to hold out,\" she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nFrank put his arm around her. \"Nicole, I'm sorry, it's pretty likely the\r\nonly people left alive from Victoire are already here. Lucky most of\r\nthem could outrun the Indians and get here.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Frank, what's happened to the rest of them--Marchette,\r\nClarissa--are they all dead?\"\r\n\r\nFrank didn't answer. He just stood there holding her.\r\n\r\nGrief weighed on her like a cloak of iron. If she hadn't had Frank to\r\nlean against, she would surely have fallen to the floor. She looked out\r\nagain and saw other, more distant columns of smoke. The Indians must\r\nhave come from the east and struck every farmhouse they came across.\r\nThey had surely destroyed Philip Hale's church. Poor Nancy!\r\n\r\nDavid Cooper said, \"Sometimes people manage to hide. The Indians can't\r\nlook everywhere.\"\r\n\r\nThe weight on her back and shoulders seemed to lighten with that\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the lead mine, for instance,\" Frank said. \"A perfect place.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, they can't have killed all those people,\" Nicole said.\r\n\r\n_Please, let Marchette and Clarissa and Nancy and Reverend Hale be\r\nalive._\r\n\r\nShe desperately wanted to pray. She wanted to believe that a loving God\r\nwas looking down on Victoire and Victor, protecting her friends and the\r\npeople she had grown up with.\r\n\r\nFor the next hour or more Nicole thought of nothing and did nothing but\r\nbite cartridges and dump powder, ram home bullets, put one rifle into\r\nFrank's ink-stained hands, take the other rifle and load it. Her mouth\r\nwas sore from biting the heavy paper. Her arms and hands ached from\r\nmaking the same movements over and over. The incessant shooting all\r\naround her deafened her, the stink--and, worse, the taste--of gunpowder\r\nturned her stomach, and her hands were blacker with the stuff than\r\nFrank's ever were from his printing press.\r\n\r\nFrank was firing less and less often. He leaned against the log wall,\r\nwiping his arm across his forehead.\r\n\r\n\"We've kept pouring lead into the courtyard. That's driven them under\r\ncover. But they broke holes in the corner tower walls, and they're\r\nshooting back at us from there.\" An Indian yelp caught his attention,\r\nand he peered out again.\r\n\r\n\"Now, would you look at that!\" he said. Nicole put her head next to his\r\nat the rifle port.\r\n\r\nA blizzard in the trading post courtyard. Flecks of white filled the air\r\nbetween the inn and the blockhouse. She saw brown arms shaking slashed\r\nmattresses and pillows out the windows. Feathers floated up to the\r\ngunport. More feathers slowly drifted down to dot the fresh June grass\r\nwith white. She heard yells and laughter from the inn.\r\n\r\n_They'd cut me open as soon as they'd cut open a pillow, and think that\r\nwas just as funny._\r\n\r\n\"They're getting drunk,\" Frank said. \"On all the liquor in Raoul's\r\ntavern. Must be looting the town too.\"\r\n\r\n_They'll burn our home. Everything will be gone, the beds and the\r\ndishes, the mirrors, the bureaus, the spinning wheel, the clock, the\r\nplates and silverware, our clothes, our books and old letters,\r\nchildren's toys, the spices, the cradle I rocked all our babies in. The\r\nmachines and carpentry tools, and, oh, please, God, not Frank's printing\r\npress!_\r\n\r\n_Stop it, Nicole. You're blessed! Blessed that they attacked at dawn\r\nwhen all the children were in the house and not scattered all over the\r\ncountryside, and now they're safely in here. Blessed that your husband\r\nis standing here beside you and not dead on the palisade parapet like\r\nBurke Russell._\r\n\r\nBut even as she thought of things to be thankful for, she remembered\r\nwhat might happen to them in the next few hours.\r\n\r\nAn Indian charged out of the front door of the inn. He was waving a\r\ncurving Navy cutlass. He ran at the blockhouse, screaming. His steps\r\nwavered, though, and Nicole guessed he must be full of whiskey.\r\n\r\nStill she was terrified. What if everyone missed him and he somehow got\r\nin and others followed?\r\n\r\n\"Look out,\" Frank said, and gently nudged her away from the port. He\r\npushed his rifle out and fired.\r\n\r\n\"I hit him, but he isn't falling.\"\r\n\r\nGetting back into the routine, Nicole took Frank's rifle and loaded it.\r\nRifles were booming all along the front of the blockhouse as men tried\r\nto stop the Indian with the cutlass. Frank's second rifle went off.\r\n\r\n\"He doesn't want to die,\" said Frank. \"He's full of bullets.\" She heard\r\npain in his voice, and as she handed him his freshly loaded rifle,\r\nNicole saw that his upper lip was beaded with sweat. She hurt for him.\r\nHe hated killing, and now he was forced to try again and again to kill\r\nthis man.\r\n\r\nFrank aimed and fired again. \"There. I got him. He's down.\"\r\n\r\nFrank pulled his rifle in and handed it to Nicole. As she started to\r\nreload it, he leaned against the wall. Slowly his knees bent and he slid\r\ndown till he was sitting on the floor. She put the rifle down and\r\ncrouched beside him, stroking his arm, her heart aching.\r\n\r\nHe covered his mouth with his hand. His body jerked, but he managed to\r\nhold in the vomit. After a moment, breathing heavily, he took his hand\r\naway from his mouth.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Jesus! What am I doing?\"\r\n\r\nNicole put her arms around him, and his head fell against her breast.\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me, Miz Hopkins,\" said a voice above her. She let go of Frank as\r\nDavid Cooper squatted down beside them and laid his hand on Frank's\r\nknee.\r\n\r\n\"Hopkins, you're all right. I was with Harrison at Tippecanoe Village,\r\nand when the Indians came at us out of the woods, I don't believe more\r\nthan half the men fired their rifles. There's really few men find it\r\neasy to kill. There's times we got to.\"\r\n\r\nFrank wiped his eyes and laid a hand on top of Cooper's. \"Thanks.\"\r\n\r\nCooper said, \"If you still feel bad, just think about what they'd do to\r\nyour wife and kids if they got in here.\"\r\n\r\nFrank put a hand on the floor and pushed himself to his feet. \"Yes, as\r\nlong as I think about my family I'll be able to shoot.\" There was a\r\nbitterness in his voice, and Nicole felt she knew what he was thinking.\r\nHow cruel the irony, that love for his family could make him into a\r\nkiller.\r\n\r\n\"Here they come again!\" a woman down the line shouted.\r\n\r\nAgain and again Nicole heard the rapping of bullets into the log wall\r\nnear Frank's head as he fired steadily at Indians charging from the\r\ntrading post buildings they had captured.\r\n\r\nFrank turned from the rifle port to hand Nicole an empty rifle and take\r\na loaded one. An arrow flashed through the narrow opening, missing his\r\nhead by inches.\r\n\r\n_Thank you, God!_\r\n\r\nThe defenders kept up a steady fire until the Indians withdrew again\r\ninto the captured buildings. Nicole and Frank took turns watching\r\nthrough the rifle port. What was happening to their home at this moment?\r\n\r\nThe lull stretched on. Nicole went downstairs to look for her children,\r\nbegan picking her way through the crowd sitting on the floor of the\r\nblockhouse hall.\r\n\r\nStretched out on a bench was a woman whose name she didn't know, a\r\nnewcomer to the settlement. The right side of her checkered dress was\r\nsoaked with blood from shoulder to waist. Moaning faintly, the woman\r\nseemed half conscious.\r\n\r\n\"Arrow,\" said Ellen Slattery, who was pressing a folded cloth against\r\nthe woman's shoulder.\r\n\r\nNicole shuddered and patted Ellen's back and went on. She saw Tom and\r\nBen manning ground-floor gunports. Abigail, Martha and John were playing\r\naround the cannon, pretending to shoot it at the Indians. The three\r\nyoungest, Rachel, Betsy and Patrick, were with a group gathered in the\r\nstone-walled rear room Raoul used as his office. They were singing\r\nhymns. Pamela Russell, she saw, was also with the hymn singers, tears\r\nrunning down her face. As Nicole went over to the fireplace to join the\r\nwomen molding bullets, she heard:\r\n\r\n    \"My God, how many are my fears,\r\n    How fast my foes increase!\r\n    Their number how it multiplies!\r\n    How fatal to my peace.\"\r\n\r\n_That must be the first time_ those _walls have ever heard a hymn._\r\n\r\nNicole took a turn at bullet making, ladling the silvery molten lead\r\nfrom a kettle over the fire into the tiny hole in the hollowed-out mold,\r\nopening the mold with its scissor handles and dropping the still-warm\r\nball into a big basket. Another woman took each ball and filed away the\r\nbit of waste metal formed in the hole through which the lead was poured.\r\n\r\n\"Injuns!\" a man yelled. The women and children crouched down on the\r\nfloor, and Nicole hurried upstairs to help Frank.\r\n\r\nAfter rifle fire from both levels drove back the latest assault, Frank\r\nsaid, \"We get a few each time they attack, but it's not enough. I'm sure\r\nI saw over a hundred of them when I was on the parapet.\"\r\n\r\n\"We've no food and very little water,\" said Nicole. \"They could just\r\nwait us out and we wouldn't last very long.\" The only water they had was\r\nin buckets the townspeople had brought into the blockhouse with them.\r\n\r\nDavid Cooper said, \"We've got to be ready for them to make one big rush\r\nfor the blockhouse. They'll try to set the place on fire, so we better\r\nsave as much water as we can. Ration it out.\"\r\n\r\nNicole's body broke out in a cold sweat at the thought of fire; she\r\nremembered all the gunpowder they'd relayed into the blockhouse.\r\n\r\n_Enough to blow us all up._\r\n\r\nAnd then she remembered too, what had happened to Helene twenty years\r\nago at Fort Dearborn.\r\n\r\n_Maybe being blown to bits would be a better way to go._\r\n\r\n\"And here's just the man to take charge of rationing the water,\" said\r\nCooper.\r\n\r\nNicole turned to see her father climbing up the stairs, pulling himself\r\nalong on the banister and leaning on his walking stick. As he reached\r\nthe top of the stairs Frank took his arm and helped him over to sit on a\r\nwooden box near the rifle port.\r\n\r\nElysée said, \"One of the women, Mrs. Russell, insisted on taking my\r\nrifle and standing guard in my place. I will be just as happy not to\r\nhave to fire at any red men for a while. I keep thinking I might shoot\r\nAuguste.\"\r\n\r\nNicole gasped. \"Auguste! Papa, he would never be out there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps not. Have you spoken to anyone who had news of my\r\ngrandchildren?\" Elysée asked her.\r\n\r\nNicole was about to say \"They're all here\" when she realized whom he\r\nmeant.\r\n\r\n\"Raoul and Clarissa's children?\" She shook her head sadly. \"No, Papa.\r\nAnyone from Victoire who isn't here--we don't know what happened to\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nElysée sighed. \"Poor little things. In all the years since they were\r\nborn, I got to speak to them only once or twice.\"\r\n\r\nThe cry of \"Here the Injuns come!\" broke in on them again.\r\n\r\nDavid Cooper gave Elysée brief instructions on rationing water, and the\r\nold man limped downstairs as the firing began again.\r\n\r\nNicole, loading and reloading Frank's rifles with numb arms and mind,\r\nheard firing from all around her. The Indians were coming from every\r\ndirection. Arrows and an occasional bullet whistled in through the\r\nports, but no one was hit. Smoke drifted through the second story of the\r\nblockhouse, making her eyes water.\r\n\r\nThe Indians withdrew again. As the firing died down, Nicole was thankful\r\nto see that the powder smoke that had filled the second floor blew up\r\ntoward the roof and vanished. Looking up, she saw that there was a space\r\nnearly a foot high between the top of the log wall and the roof. The\r\nroof rested on big vertical timbers, its overhang covering the opening.\r\nMen could climb up there, she supposed, and shoot down; the attackers\r\nwould have to be standing directly below them to shoot back.\r\n\r\nThere was a heap she didn't know about this fort. In the years since\r\nRaoul had built it she'd hardly ever had reason to set foot inside--the\r\nlast time was when she and Frank had appealed to him to leave men behind\r\nto protect the town. Now her life depended on how well Raoul had built\r\nit, and it was bitter medicine to swallow.\r\n\r\nDavid Cooper left his rifle port to talk to Frank.\r\n\r\n\"It's only a few hours till sunset,\" Cooper said in a low voice, \"and I\r\nhave a hunch they'll try one big attack to take this place before dark.\r\nIf they come all at once, we don't have enough rifles to stop them.\"\r\n\r\nHis tone was matter-of-fact, but his words struck terror into Nicole's\r\nheart. She took Frank's hand and squeezed it. It felt cold as a dead\r\nman's.\r\n\r\nCooper went on. \"I keep thinking about that cannon downstairs. You know,\r\nwhatever we might say about Raoul de Marion, he did set this place up to\r\nbe defended. I figure that cannon must be in working order.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know how to fire a cannon?\" Frank asked.\r\n\r\nCooper shrugged. \"I've stood near the artillerymen a time or two and\r\nwatched them, but never thought to memorize what I saw. I couldn't even\r\nsay how much gunpowder to use. If we put in too little, we'll waste our\r\nchance. If we put in too much, we could blow ourselves all to hell.\"\r\n\r\nNicole said, \"I'd rather that than face whatever hell the Indians have\r\nin store for us.\"\r\n\r\nCooper looked at her with his hard eyes and nodded. \"Indians won't get\r\nyou, Miz Hopkins. I promise you that. Let's go take a look at that\r\nthing.\"\r\n\r\nFrank, Cooper and Nicole, chilled but grimly reassured by Cooper's\r\nremark, cleared away the children who were straddling the cannon's\r\nfour-foot-long black barrel, and the women who were sitting against its\r\nwooden carriage. Cooper stood frowning at the gun.\r\n\r\nHe sighed, and it sounded to Nicole like the sigh of a man about to step\r\noff a high cliff.\r\n\r\n\"Well, let's load 'er up.\"\r\n\r\nHe went over to the side of the room where the flannel bags of gunpowder\r\nwere piled up, and he picked one up, holding it at arm's length as if it\r\nwere a rattlesnake. He carried it back to the cannon and slid it into\r\nthe muzzle. From the carriage he unstrapped the ramrod, a pole with a\r\nwad of cloth wrapped around its end, and used that to push the gunpowder\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n\"Let's add another bag of powder,\" he said to Frank.\r\n\r\nWomen and children formed a circle to watch. Nicole pictured what the\r\ncannon would do to all the people in this room if it blew up, and shut\r\nher eyes.\r\n\r\nAfter pushing a second bag of gunpowder down the muzzle, Cooper said,\r\n\"What we need now is canister shot that'd spread all over the place and\r\npuncture a lot of Indians. I remember there was canister shot in the\r\npowder magazine, but it didn't seem all that important this morning, and\r\nwe didn't have time to move it over here. Now we'll have to make do with\r\nwhat we've got. Give me a load of rifle bullets.\"\r\n\r\nSomeone handed him a basket full of lead balls, and he poured them into\r\nthe cannon's throat and pushed them down with the ramrod.\r\n\r\n\"I don't want to use up all our rifle shot, but seems to me there's room\r\ninside this thing for a lot more.\" He turned to the onlookers.\r\n\"Everybody spread out and bring me anything made of metal that'll fit in\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\nInto the cannon's maw went two chains, a padlock, a handful of knives\r\nand forks. And a dozen lead soldiers, sent to war by the small boys who\r\nowned them.\r\n\r\n\"Here, Mr. Cooper, use these.\" Pamela Russell pushed her way through the\r\ncrowd holding out a canvas bag. Her eyes were bloodshot, the lids\r\nswollen and red.\r\n\r\nCooper frowned. \"What's that?\"\r\n\r\n\"A bag of pieces of eight from Raoul de Marion's safe. When Burke knew\r\nhe was going to be in the fighting, he gave me the trading post keys to\r\nhold for him.\" She stopped, red-faced and choking, then continued.\r\n\"Burke didn't know anything about fighting Indians. My husband is dead\r\nbecause de Marion left us almost defenseless. He doesn't deserve to have\r\nthis silver.\"\r\n\r\nFeeling Pamela's agony, Nicole went over to her and put an arm around\r\nher back and hugged her. Pamela's body was stiff, unresponsive.\r\n\r\nCooper's gaze traveled over the people gathered around the cannon. \"Any\r\nof you folks see anything wrong with us doing this?\"\r\n\r\n\"We always use Spanish dollars out here on the frontier,\" said Elysée\r\nwith a smile. \"The U.S. Government simply didn't mint enough coins. I'm\r\nsure the Indians will accept them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that defense will do for now,\" said Cooper, grinning as he slit\r\nthe bag with his hunting knife and poured the glittering silver disks\r\ninto the cannon. \"Going to make some Indians rich today,\" he said. \"Now,\r\nwe need something to touch it off with. I don't see any linstock around\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"A candle?\" Frank found a long white candle that would burn for about an\r\nhour and lit it from another one mounted on a wall.\r\n\r\n\"Should work,\" said Cooper. \"Keep a lighted candle by the cannon at all\r\ntimes. We have no way of knowing when they'll decide to make their big\r\nattack.\"\r\n\r\nPamela Russell pulled free of Nicole and gripped Cooper's arm.\r\n\r\n\"Let me touch off the cannon,\" she said.\r\n\r\nThere was something frightening, Nicole thought, in the avid light in\r\nher eyes.\r\n\r\n_Is that how I'd be if Frank were killed?_ Nicole wondered. _So utterly\r\nvengeful?_\r\n\r\nCooper said, \"Sure you can do it?\"\r\n\r\nPamela whispered through tight lips, \"Oh, yes. Yes, I am!\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said Cooper. \"You can touch it off. But look out the\r\nIndians don't shoot you when we swing the door open.\"\r\n\r\nFrank, Cooper and two more men kicked the chocks out from under the\r\ncannon's four wooden wheels. The men strained against the gun, and for a\r\nmoment Nicole was afraid they wouldn't be able to move it. Then,\r\ngrudgingly, it rumbled over the puncheon floor until Cooper set the four\r\nchocks back under the wheels. The cannon rested just a few feet back\r\nfrom the front door.\r\n\r\nLooking through a port on the west side of the hall, Nicole saw the sun\r\nstill high in the west. This was the month when days were longest.\r\n\r\n_And this has been the longest day of my life_, she thought.\r\n\r\nAs the afternoon passed with agonizing slowness, Pamela Russell had to\r\nlight yet a second candle, and then a third. She sat rigid in a chair\r\nbeside the cannon, holding her candle upright, saying nothing, staring\r\nfixedly at the blockhouse door.\r\n\r\nNicole noticed a beam of sunlight from a west-facing rifle port lighting\r\nup the smoke and dust that drifted through the main hall of the\r\nblockhouse. The shaft of light looked like a solid bar of gold. She\r\nlooked through the rifle port and was almost blinded by the sun just\r\nabove the humped silhouettes of hills across the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nShe heard the Indians screaming, and her stomach turned over.\r\n\r\n\"Fire arrows!\" someone yelled.\r\n\r\nNicole's heart stopped. If the Indians managed to set fire to the\r\nblockhouse, the hundreds of people who had taken shelter here would be\r\ndriven out to be slaughtered.\r\n\r\nShe ran to the slot in the stone wall where Tom was standing with his\r\nrifle ready. Looking past her son's head, she saw an arrow with a\r\ncloth-wrapped, burning tip arc up from the courtyard. It disappeared,\r\nand she thought it must have hit the second-story log wall somewhere\r\nabove her.\r\n\r\n\"Upstairs!\" Cooper shouted. \"Fill your buckets from the water barrels\r\nand come on.\" His sweeping finger included a bunch of excited smaller\r\nboys, who followed him up the stairs. Nicole hurried after them.\r\n\r\nCooper and the other men boosted boys with buckets to the top of the log\r\nwalls. The boys pulled themselves up to the open space Nicole had\r\nnoticed before under the overhang of the roof. Leaning out, sheltered,\r\nthe boys were able to see where the fire arrows had stuck, and dumped\r\nwater on them.\r\n\r\nCooper grinned. \"De Marion built well. The ground floor's stone and the\r\nroof is covered with sheet lead. Injuns'll soon tire of this game.\"\r\n\r\nThe fire arrows became fewer. They stopped coming, and there was a\r\nbreathless silence in which time did not seem to pass. Then Cooper led\r\nthe way back down to the ground floor.\r\n\r\nHigh-pitched Indians whoops sent a new chill through Nicole.\r\n\r\nA rifle went off--Tom, at the gunport to the left of the front door.\r\n\r\n\"Hold your fire, boy!\" Cooper called, watching from the other side of\r\nthe doorway. \"Let them come.\"\r\n\r\nNicole went to stand beside her oldest son again and look out. The front\r\ngate of the palisade was open and Indians were streaming in. Brown\r\nbodies painted with yellow and red and black slashes, arms waving\r\nknives, clubs, tomahawks, bows and arrows, rifles. More were tumbling\r\nout the front door of the inn. A flicker of red light caught her eye.\r\nFlames shot out the open front door of the fur shop. They were burning\r\nall those valuable pelts. Raoul would lose a lot today.\r\n\r\nAnd not just money, she thought, recalling burning Victoire. Money would\r\nbe the least of Raoul's loss. To her surprise she felt a moment's sorrow\r\nfor the brother she had come to despise.\r\n\r\nTwenty or more Indians came through the gate carrying a huge black log,\r\nits front end afire. The rest of the Indians gathered around them. All\r\ntogether they ran at the blockhouse door, the glowing, smoking tip of\r\nthe log in the forefront.\r\n\r\n\"Everybody get as far away from this damned cannon as you can!\" Frank\r\nshouted. People scrambled away, leaving an empty space around the\r\nsix-pounder in the center of the floor. Some ran into the strong room\r\nand some scurried upstairs. Only Cooper, Frank and Pamela Russell stood\r\nby the cannon. Nicole stayed where she was, moving her body so that she\r\nwas between Tom and the cannon.\r\n\r\n_Whatever happens will be what God wants to happen._\r\n\r\n\"Open the door!\" Cooper ordered.\r\n\r\nTom Slattery, the blacksmith, swung the door open, and Nicole saw some\r\nof the Indians hesitate, then rush forward. She wondered if they could\r\nsee the cannon in the shadowy interior of the blockhouse.\r\n\r\n\"Shoot!\" yelled Cooper.\r\n\r\nCarefully, deliberately, Pamela Russell lowered her candle to the\r\ncannon's touchhole.\r\n\r\n\"Fire in the hole!\" Cooper called out.\r\n\r\nNicole heard the sizzle of gunpowder from where she stood.\r\n\r\nThe boom of the cannon hit Nicole's skull like a mallet. A huge white\r\ncloud belched out through the open door, and the sharp reek of burnt\r\npowder filled the air. The gun jumped right over the chocks set behind\r\nits wheels and flew back about six feet.\r\n\r\nIn the aftermath of the cannon's roar came whoops of delight from nearly\r\na hundred small boys in the blockhouse.\r\n\r\nThen Nicole heard the Indians screaming again, but now they were screams\r\nof agony, not war cries. A fierce joy rose in her as she stood in the\r\nopen doorway and saw the yard of the trading post transformed into a\r\nvision of Hell. Through the haze she saw dark bodies sprawling on the\r\nground. Some of the Indians writhed in the dust of the yard, some were\r\nmotionless. Others were frantically pulling the fallen back, dragging\r\nthem by the arms or legs. The log they were going to use to batter down\r\nthe door lay smouldering, abandoned in the yard of the trading post.\r\n\r\nAs she took in more of the sight of blood and torn bodies and severed\r\nlimbs, Nicole felt ashamed that she had rejoiced at first. Sickened, she\r\nturned away.\r\n\r\n\"Fire your rifles!\" David Cooper yelled. \"Shoot, shoot, shoot! Keep them\r\non the run. And shut that damned door.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me at the port, Maw,\" Tom demanded.\r\n\r\nThe rifles banged away, sounding puny in Nicole's ears after the roar of\r\nthe cannon. Finally Cooper ordered an end to the shooting.\r\n\r\n\"If we let 'em drag their dead out of here, they may be in a mood to\r\nleave.\"\r\n\r\nNicole waited in dread, wondering whether the Indians would come again.\r\nThe sunset rays pouring through the ports on the west side of the\r\nblockhouse slowly faded, leaving the main room dark. People lit more\r\ncandles. David Cooper directed the reloading of the cannon.\r\n\r\nThe group in Raoul's office were singing hymns again, and many people\r\nsitting around the hall joined them. Nicole sat beside Pamela Russell on\r\na bench and took her hand, and soon Pamela began to talk quietly. She\r\ntold Nicole things about Burke, the books he enjoyed reading, his\r\nfavorite dishes, jokes he used to tell her.\r\n\r\n\"I always envied you, Nicole, with so many children. We wanted children\r\nso much, and we never got any. And now we'll never--\"\r\n\r\nNicole tried to think of something to say, but everything that came to\r\nher sounded foolish to her mind's ear. Looking at Frank standing by a\r\nport, she thought, _I have been blessed, and Pamela hasn't been. But\r\nwhy?_ That had to mean something. She couldn't think what.\r\n\r\n\"It helps me, when life is hard, to believe that God has a plan,\" she\r\nsaid, patting Pamela's hand. \"His plan is like a painting that's so big\r\nwe can only see dark spots or bright spots without knowing what it all\r\nmeans. But I think one day he'll take us up with him, where we can see\r\nthe whole picture and understand it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nicole,\" Frank called. She gave Pamela's hand a squeeze and went to see\r\nwhat Frank was looking at through the rifle port.\r\n\r\nEven at this distance she could hear the roaring of the flames. Sparks\r\nshot up past the palisade, and a red glow filled the sky.\r\n\r\n\"They're burning the town,\" he said. \"Our home is gone. Our shop.\"\r\n\r\nShe turned back to see Pamela, sitting on the bench, a lost look on her\r\npale face. She thought of the people who had not managed to reach the\r\nshelter of the trading post. She put her arm around Frank's waist and\r\npressed herself against him.\r\n\r\n\"You and I are alive and all of our children are alive,\" she said. \"God\r\nhas blessed us.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n16\r\n\r\nYellow Hair\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Wolf Paw has come back!\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear felt a hollow in his stomach as the cry ran through the camp.\r\nWolf Paw had vowed to bring death and destruction to the pale eyes such\r\nas they had never known before.\r\n\r\nBefore he left, Wolf Paw had held a ritual dog feast to insure success.\r\nHe had hung one of his own dogs from a painted pole by its hind legs and\r\ndisemboweled it alive, asking Earthmaker's blessing on the war party.\r\nThen his wives, Running Deer and Burning Pine, had cooked the dog and\r\nserved bits of the meat to the braves and warriors who would follow Wolf\r\nPaw on this raid. If he would choose one of his cherished dogs to be\r\nsacrificed, what would he do to the people of Victor?\r\n\r\nFor days White Bear had held himself rigid, hardly able to eat, lying\r\nawake at night, waiting for Wolf Paw's war party to come back. What\r\nhorrors would he have to face now?\r\n\r\nWomen and children ran to surround the returning braves and warriors.\r\nWhite Bear saw Iron Knife on horseback towering above the crowd, his\r\nhuge arms lifted triumphantly. From each fist dangled a scalp. Beside\r\nhim was Wolf Paw, a blue cloth, stained red with blood, wrapped around\r\nhis left shoulder. Wolf Paw's right hand was raised high, gripping three\r\nlong hanks of hair with disks of white flesh hanging from them. More\r\nbraves rode behind them, also holding up scalps. Scalps, scalps, scalps.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear staggered. He could not take his eyes from them. The hair was\r\nof many different colors--light brown, gray, dark brown, black. Some of\r\nthe locks were very long, and must have been taken from women's heads.\r\n\r\nCould Wolf Paw be holding Nicole's hair, or Frank's? Could it be\r\nGrandpapa's?\r\n\r\nHeart pounding, White Bear forced himself to push through the crowd. He\r\nheard cattle lowing and horses neighing in the distance. Questioning\r\nshouts and cries of greeting.\r\n\r\nA scream of agony froze him. A woman's voice. And then another, from\r\nanother part of the crowd, piercing his eardrums. And still more\r\nscreams. He realized what was happening. Women were learning that their\r\nmen had not come back.\r\n\r\nScalps and screams. Wolf Paw's gifts to the British Band. White Bear\r\nworked his way past women calling out anxious questions.\r\n\r\nHe suddenly came upon his mother leading a wailing pregnant woman out of\r\nthe crowd.\r\n\r\n\"She heard that her husband was killed, and she has gone into labor,\"\r\nSun Woman said, her face hollow with her own pain. White Bear squeezed\r\nher arm briefly as she passed him.\r\n\r\nWhen he got close to Wolf Paw he saw a bound woman's body draped face\r\ndown across the back of the brave's gray pony.\r\n\r\nShe wore a ragged blue dress. Her feet were bare, dirty and covered with\r\nscratches. She did not stir. From this side of the pony White Bear could\r\nnot see her face. A sickening suspicion gripped him, and he hesitated,\r\nnot wanting his fear confirmed.\r\n\r\nWolf Paw, frowning down at him angrily, was still wearing his yellow and\r\nred war paint, faded by the ride of several days.\r\n\r\n\"I raided the town where you lived, White Bear. I took forty head of\r\ncattle and twenty horses from your pale eyes relatives.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am glad to hear of the cattle,\" said White Bear. \"Our people are\r\nstarving.\"\r\n\r\nWanting, and not wanting, to know who Wolf Paw's captive was, he walked\r\naround the brave's horse for a better look at the bound woman.\r\n\r\n\"We killed many pale eyes,\" Wolf Paw said. \"They will never forget Wolf\r\nPaw's raid. Tonight we will have a scalp dance for the warriors who have\r\nbecome braves.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear stopped walking. People he knew and loved on both sides had\r\ndied; he had to learn which ones.\r\n\r\nAfter a moment he collected himself. \"And will you dance for the braves\r\nand warriors you did not bring back?\" It was a cruel thing to say, but\r\nWolf Paw deserved it. Wolf Paw did not answer.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear had to fight himself to keep from crying aloud in anguish. He\r\nno longer had any doubt who the captive woman was who hung head down\r\nover the spotted pony.\r\n\r\nOne yellow braid was still tied with a blue bow. The other had come\r\nundone, and loose locks of blond hair hung down, almost brushing the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nHe bent to see Nancy's unconscious face.\r\n\r\nComing up beside him Redbird asked quietly, \"Do you know this woman?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he said. It all came back to him--last summer at Victoire, the\r\nmeetings on the prairie, that night in the cornfield beside her father's\r\nhouse when she had begged him to \"know\" her. Had he missed her? Yes; he\r\nhad to admit that. Did he love her? He was not sure, but, happy as he\r\nhad been with Redbird, he often thought of Nancy and wondered if she\r\nstill longed for him as she had when he left her.\r\n\r\nHow, without hurting Redbird, who stood next to him watching as he\r\nstared down at Nancy, could he explain what this white woman meant to\r\nhim?\r\n\r\nHe reached out to untie the rope looped around Nancy's back that held\r\nher to Wolf Paw's horse.\r\n\r\n\"Do not touch her,\" Wolf Paw growled. \"She is for me, and only for me.\"\r\n\r\nNo, White Bear thought, he could not let Nancy be kidnapped and raped by\r\nthis man. Whatever bloody things had been done at Victor, this he must\r\nprevent. He readied himself to fight Wolf Paw if he had to.\r\n\r\nAnd how would he explain _that_ to Redbird?\r\n\r\nWolf Paw slid down from his horse and, one-handed, untied Nancy. Fresh\r\nblood was soaking through the cloth around his shoulder--a strip of blue\r\ngingham torn from Nancy's dress, White Bear now saw.\r\n\r\nWeak from his wound, Wolf Paw could not lift Nancy and carry her.\r\nRegardless of Wolf Paw's warning, White Bear would not let her fall. He\r\ntook her from Wolf Paw and eased her to the ground. Her eyelids were\r\nfluttering. Redbird, bending awkwardly with her swollen belly, helped\r\nhim. Their eyes met, and she looked searchingly into his.\r\n\r\nA woman's voice cried, \"The pale eyes squaw is _not_ for you, Wolf Paw.\r\nI will not have her in my wickiup.\" Running Deer, the older of Wolf\r\nPaw's two wives, strode up to Wolf Paw, thrusting her face into his.\r\nBehind her came Burning Pine, the younger wife, a papoose strapped to\r\nher back, looking equally determined.\r\n\r\n\"My wives will do as I say,\" Wolf Paw grumbled, but there was no\r\nstrength in his voice.\r\n\r\nBurning Pine said, \"Your wives and children are hungry. We are eating\r\nroots and bark. We have no food for any pale eyes.\"\r\n\r\nFor now, Black Hawk's band was hidden away on an island of dry ground in\r\nthe heart of a great marsh north of the headwaters of the Rock River,\r\nwell into the Michigan Territory. But there was scarcely any game or\r\nfish here, and they could not stay in this place much longer.\r\n\r\nWolf Paw said, \"I have brought cattle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then the people will eat well because of my husband,\" Running Deer\r\nsaid. \"But the pale eyes woman will not need to eat.\" Running Deer\r\nturned to the crowd. \"Many women lost their husbands in Wolf Paw's raid.\r\nIt is right that the women avenge themselves on this pale eyes.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear's back crawled with gooseflesh. Running Deer meant for the\r\nwomen of the band to torture Nancy to death.\r\n\r\nFor as long as they could make her pain last, it would take their minds\r\noff their hunger and sickness and sorrow. And their own fear of death.\r\n\r\nIt must not happen. But how could he prevent it?\r\n\r\nFeeling like a drowning man being swept away on rapids, White Bear\r\nwatched Running Deer and Burning Pine lift Nancy from the ground and\r\ncarry her off, with her feet dragging. Wolf Paw and most of the braves\r\nwho had returned with him followed.\r\n\r\nWolf Paw's wives pulled Nancy through the band's collection of hastily\r\nbuilt wickiups and lean-tos. They brought her to a tall elm tree growing\r\nup in the center of the camp. The tree was dying. Its bark had been\r\nstripped to cover a wickiup.\r\n\r\nBy the time White Bear caught up with the crowd around Nancy, her eyes\r\nwere wide open, but unfocused. Running Deer pushed her against the trunk\r\nof the elm tree and drew a knife. With swift, angry slashes, Wolf Paw's\r\nsenior wife stripped away Nancy's dress and the chemise under it. Nancy\r\nstood naked before the tribe. Her eyes were still open and unseeing.\r\nShe made no attempt to cover herself. She did not seem to know what was\r\nhappening to her. White Bear's skin crawled with shame at the sight of\r\nher degradation.\r\n\r\nWomen laughed. \"Her skin is like a frog's belly!\"\r\n\r\nMen stared greedily.\r\n\r\nRunning Deer took a coil of rawhide rope and lashed Nancy to the tree,\r\nand White Bear felt the muscles of his neck and shoulders knotting till\r\nthey ached. He could scarcely bear to look at Nancy, who hung in her\r\nbonds, her eyes closed again.\r\n\r\nHe did not care if they killed him. He would not let them do this. He\r\nwould not allow it to go on a moment longer.\r\n\r\nHe put his hand over the five claw scars on his chest and spoke to his\r\nspirit self. _O Bear spirit, give me the power to move the people to\r\nmercy._\r\n\r\nHe felt strength surge into his chest and arms, and raising his medicine\r\nstick, he strode forward.\r\n\r\nWhen he was only a foot away from Nancy, her eyes opened suddenly, huge\r\nand turquoise, staring into his.\r\n\r\n\"Auguste!\" Her voice and face were full of terror.\r\n\r\nIt came to him with a shock that he must look frightful to her. The man\r\nshe had loved was transformed into a vision of savagery--painted face, a\r\nshoulder-length mane of hair, silver earrings, shell necklace, his\r\nscarred chest bare, holding high a painted stick adorned with feathers\r\nand beads. And what would she make of his right ear, torn in two by Eli\r\nGreenglove's rifle ball? After what she had already gone through, the\r\nsight of him must be yet another impossible shock.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to help you,\" he said in English. \"Try not to show that\r\nyou're frightened.\" Useless advice, he thought. Still, it would be\r\nbetter for them both if the people respected her. There was nothing a\r\nSauk despised more than a show of fear.\r\n\r\nHe pointed his medicine stick at Running Deer and said sternly, \"Stand\r\naside.\" She glowered at him but stepped back.\r\n\r\nLast winter Wolf Paw had snatched this stick from his hand. But that was\r\nbefore White Bear had nearly been killed carrying Black Hawk's message\r\nof peace to the pale eyes. That was before they had begun to see for\r\nthemselves that White Bear had spoken truly when he warned that Black\r\nHawk's hope of a great alliance to defeat the long knives was an\r\nillusion. And that was before many of the people had felt his healing\r\ntouch. He knew how to do things, because of his training with pale eyes\r\ndoctors, that Owl Carver and Sun Woman did not.\r\n\r\nNow White Bear's medicine stick had much more power than a few moons\r\nago. Even at this moment when anxiety for Nancy gnawed at him, he felt\r\npride in his power.\r\n\r\nHe turned to face the crowd, standing protectively in front of Nancy.\r\n\r\nThe braves and warriors stared at him, puzzled and angry.\r\n\r\n\"Is this how you show your strength and courage, by torturing a helpless\r\nwoman?\" he demanded.\r\n\r\nWolf Paw said, \"She is a trophy honorably taken in battle.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear pointed to Running Deer. \"Wolf Paw meant to take the pale\r\neyes woman into his wickiup for his pleasure. But his wife will not let\r\nhim. So he pretends that it is his pleasure to let the women torture\r\nher.\"\r\n\r\nFeeling stronger than ever, White Bear watched Wolf Paw's face darken.\r\nHe might be able to outfight any man in the tribe barehanded or with\r\nweapons, but not with words. This moment, thought White Bear, began to\r\nrepay Wolf Paw for shaming him last winter before the council.\r\n\r\n_And he will have to let me tend his wound. That, too, will repay him._\r\n\r\nWolf Paw stood glowering at White Bear, his eyes glazing, his breath\r\ncoming in gasps. He must be on the verge of fainting from the pain,\r\nWhite Bear thought.\r\n\r\n\"I captured the pale eyes woman,\" Wolf Paw said. \"I give her to the\r\ntribe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are we fighting the pale eyes so we can steal their women?\" White Bear\r\ndemanded. \"As long as we torture and kill their people, the long knives\r\nwill think of us as wild animals that must be destroyed. I have lived\r\namong the pale eyes, and I tell you that we must show them that we are\r\nworthy of their respect.\"\r\n\r\nWolf Paw grumbled, \"We will win their respect by killing them. I have\r\nkilled many.\"\r\n\r\n_Many at Victor, no doubt_, White Bear thought, feeling as sick as Wolf\r\nPaw looked, hating him for his ignorance.\r\n\r\nHe addressed the whole gathering. \"Since Wolf Paw has given this woman\r\nto the tribe, let the tribe treat her honorably,\" White Bear said. \"The\r\nday will come when we will have to sit down with the long knives and\r\ntalk.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not if we win!\" cried Wolf Paw.\r\n\r\n\"Win?\" White Bear laughed scornfully. \"Does Wolf Paw still imagine that\r\nthousands of long knives are going to surrender to our few hundred Sauk\r\nand Fox warriors? We can win only if they decide to stop fighting us. If\r\nwe make them hate us, they will never stop fighting until all of us are\r\ndead.\"\r\n\r\n_It is probably already too late for talking with the long knives, but\r\nif I hold out the hope of peace, it may save Nancy's life._\r\n\r\nHe let his gaze travel over the people who stood in a ring around him.\r\nThe dark eyes looking at him were mostly sullen and suspicious, because\r\ntheir shaman was telling them what they did not want to hear. No one\r\nseemed ready to challenge him, but he knew that if three or four braves\r\nwere to overpower him and kill Nancy, the crowd would let it happen. His\r\nbelly muscles knotted with tension.\r\n\r\nBut, as Wolf Paw had said, they needed all their luck, and it would be\r\nbest not to tempt the wrath of the spirits by defying their shaman.\r\n\r\n_Redbird, you must not fail me._ He gave his wife a look of appeal\r\nbefore he spoke further. Behind Redbird Iron Knife stood like a great\r\noak tree. At least there was no threat to him in Iron Knife's face.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear took a deep breath and his heart fluttered. His life and\r\nNancy's depended on what happened next.\r\n\r\n\"I take the pale eyes woman under my protection,\" he said. \"Redbird,\r\nuntie her.\"\r\n\r\nRedbird hesitated for just a moment, her eyes wide, and White Bear held\r\nhis breath. If, moved by jealousy, she refused to obey him and sided\r\nwith Running Deer, there was no hope for Nancy.\r\n\r\nAt that thought a resolve arose in him, dark and powerful as a storm on\r\nthe Great River, and he filled his lungs and squared his shoulders.\r\n\r\n_If they try to kill her, they will have to kill me first. If she is\r\ndoomed, so am I._\r\n\r\nIf he stood by and let the people torture Nancy to death, he would hate\r\nhimself forever.\r\n\r\nRedbird lowered her eyes and began to undo the rope around Nancy. Iron\r\nKnife helped his sister. Relief brightened in White Bear, like sunlight\r\non the river after a storm. Relief, and a surge of love for his wife.\r\nWith Iron Knife siding with him and Wolf Paw weakened by his wound, no\r\nbrave would dare to challenge him.\r\n\r\nEagle Feather was standing in front of the crowd, and White Bear felt\r\nproud that his son was seeing the people treat him with respect. That\r\nmight balance out the memory of that shameful night of the woman's\r\ndress.\r\n\r\n\"Eagle Feather, run and get one of our blankets.\"\r\n\r\nNancy looked at White Bear with huge, frightened eyes, saying nothing.\r\nTerror must have struck her dumb. But he was relieved to see she was\r\nable to stand on her own. Redbird put a hand on her shoulder to steady\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\"You're going to be all right,\" White Bear said in English. \"We will\r\ntake you to my wickiup.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned to Wolf Paw. \"Come with me. I will see to your wound.\" Wolf\r\nPaw's brown skin looked clammy and bloodless. He had ridden for four\r\ndays with a bullet in his shoulder. It must come out at once, or it\r\nwould kill him. But White Bear took pleasure in giving orders to Wolf\r\nPaw.\r\n\r\nEagle Feather came with a blanket, and Redbird wrapped it around Nancy.\r\n\r\nMost of the people scattered, many to mourn their dead, others to hear\r\nthe stories of the braves and warriors who had come back with the war\r\nparty, still others to see the horses and to butcher some of the cattle\r\nthey had brought back. A small crowd followed White Bear, the\r\nyellow-haired prisoner and Wolf Paw.\r\n\r\nAs Redbird and Iron Knife helped Nancy, now softly sobbing, into the low\r\nstructure of branches and bark, Owl Carver came up to White Bear.\r\n\r\n\"I was ready to terrify the people if they turned against you, but you\r\ndid not need my help. You spoke to them, and against their will they\r\nheeded you.\"\r\n\r\nOwl Carver's praise delighted White Bear. But as he saw once again how\r\nthe old shaman had declined, it took some of the edge from his pleasure.\r\n\r\nOwl Carver's eyes were watery and his cheeks were sunken. His arms and\r\nlegs were thin as spear shafts. The trek up the Rock River had not been\r\ngood for him. White Bear and Sun Woman had taken over most of the work\r\nof caring for the wounded and sick, though Owl Carver did as much as he\r\ncould.\r\n\r\n\"You are a Great Shaman, as I predicted you would be,\" Owl Carver said.\r\n\"You foretold exactly what would happen if Black Hawk led the British\r\nBand across the Great River. But I am sad that your greatness must be\r\nproved by the suffering of our people.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear felt his chest expand and a warmth spread through his limbs\r\nat these words of his teacher.\r\n\r\n\"I may need your help yet,\" he said. \"The people do not like me\r\nprotecting this pale eyes woman.\"\r\n\r\nOwl Carver nodded. \"But they respect you. And they will respect you more\r\nwhen you show them you have magical powers.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no magical powers.\"\r\n\r\n\"You do. It was not I who put the mark of the Bear on your chest.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean that the White Bear is your spirit self. And he can act in this\r\nworld. The mark of his claws is the mark of his favor.\"\r\n\r\nAs White Bear let this sink in, Wolf Paw approached with a stumbling\r\nwalk. Running Deer and Burning Pine followed him.\r\n\r\nOut of their wickiup Redbird brought a blanket, White Bear's Sauk\r\nmedicine bag and his black bag of surgical instruments.\r\n\r\n\"Sit in the wickiup with the pale eyes woman,\" White Bear told Redbird.\r\n\"She is very frightened.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am frightened too,\" said Redbird as she left him.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear bit his lip. The tone of her voice said, _Who is this woman?_\r\n\r\nAs White Bear set out the markers for the seven directions, positioning\r\nfour stones around Wolf Paw, he said, \"This will hurt very much and Wolf\r\nPaw must not move.\"\r\n\r\nKeeping in place the two stones and the bear's claw White Bear laid on\r\nWolf Paw's chest would force the brave to lie still.\r\n\r\n\"You cannot hurt me,\" said Wolf Paw, just as if he were a captive and\r\nWhite Bear was about to torture him.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear turned to the people standing around them.\r\n\r\n\"All of you join hands and ask Earthmaker to heal Wolf Paw's wound.\"\r\n\r\nRunning Deer's face, which had been hard with anger, now melted into\r\ntears. Burning Pine looked hopefully at White Bear.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear gestured to Iron Knife to lift Wolf Paw's shoulder slightly.\r\nCarefully, gently, he untied and unwrapped the blood-soaked blue rag\r\ntorn from Nancy's dress. Recent bleeding had softened the scab, so that\r\nthe cloth came away easily from the wound, which was between Wolf Paw's\r\nleft armpit and his collarbone. Its shape surprised White Bear: not a\r\nround bullet hole, but a long, narrow gash, surrounded by bruised and\r\nswollen flesh.\r\n\r\n\"How did this happen to you?\" he asked. He was going to have to hurt\r\nWolf Paw all the more because the wound had gone untreated for four\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n\"When the braves attacked the blockhouse all together at the end of the\r\nday, the pale eyes opened the door and fired a big gun.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear desperately wanted to make Wolf Paw tell him everything that\r\nhad happened, but there was no time for that now. And after he heard\r\nWolf Paw's tale, he might want to hurt him even more than he had to.\r\n\r\nRaoul kept a naval six-pounder at the trading post; White Bear had heard\r\nabout it. Probably this was a piece of what the long knives called\r\ncanister shot or grapeshot in Wolf Paw's shoulder. But then why not a\r\nround hole?\r\n\r\nWhite Bear slid the steel rod he would use to explore Wolf Paw's wound\r\nthrough a loop in the end of the tongs. To see how the brave was taking\r\nit, he looked up at his face. Wolf Paw stared back at him with hard\r\nblack eyes as he pushed the probe into the wound with one hand, the\r\nother holding the handles of the tongs. When the rounded tip of the\r\nprobe had gone in about half a finger's length, it touched something\r\nhard. Not a bone, White Bear was sure. He moved the probe up and down\r\nand from side to side. The only sign of pain Wolf Paw gave was deeper,\r\nheavier breathing.\r\n\r\nHow odd! The object was definitely flat and must have hit Wolf Paw edge\r\non. It lay buried in a muscle. An inch higher and whatever it was would\r\nhave broken Wolf Paw's shoulder. White Bear moved the tongs into\r\nposition within the torn flesh, one end on each side of the flat object.\r\nHis hand ached as he tightened his grip on the tongs. He had learned how\r\nto get a good grip on bullets, but the blood would make this flat\r\nmissile slippery.\r\n\r\nWolf Paw was not breathing now. White Bear did not dare to look into his\r\nface. For both of them, White Bear understood, this was a moment of\r\ntesting.\r\n\r\nHolding his own breath, praying to Earthmaker to strengthen his grip on\r\nthe tongs, White Bear began to pull.\r\n\r\nWolf Paw gave the faintest groan. Another man would probably be\r\nscreaming.\r\n\r\nThe flat piece of metal came almost to the surface of Wolf Paw's\r\nblackened flesh, but slid out of the tongs' grip just as White Bear was\r\nabout to draw it out. He gritted his teeth in anger.\r\n\r\nWolf Paw sighed. White Bear looked at his face and saw that only the\r\nwhites of his eyes were showing under the half-closed lids.\r\nMercifully--for both of them--he had fainted.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear looked again at the object he was trying to pull out of Wolf\r\nPaw's shoulder. He could just see a corrugated edge covered with blood.\r\nWith a bit of cloth he wiped the blood away and saw a bright silver\r\ngleam.\r\n\r\nHe gave a little gasp of amazement.\r\n\r\n_A silver coin. The last thing anyone would expect to find loaded into a\r\ncannon. Or embedded in a man's body. Those people at Victor must have\r\nbeen desperate._\r\n\r\nThat gave White Bear an inspiration. No one else was close enough to see\r\nwhat he had seen in the wound. He remembered what Owl Carver had said\r\nabout showing the people magical powers.\r\n\r\nHe waited until he saw Wolf Paw's eyelids flutter and then said, \"Wolf\r\nPaw, because you have allowed the pale eyes woman to live, the spirits\r\nwill reward you.\"\r\n\r\nWolf Paw, his lips compressed, frowned at him.\r\n\r\n\"The spirits will allow me to change the lead ball the pale eyes shot\r\ninto you to one of their silver coins.\" He spoke loudly so that the\r\npeople watching could all hear him.\r\n\r\nWolf Paw stared, as White Bear passed his medicine stick three times in\r\na sunwise circle over the bleeding shoulder.\r\n\r\nOnce again White Bear pushed the tongs into the wound. He pushed the\r\nends in past the coin, to get a good purchase on it. Wolf Paw groaned.\r\nWhite Bear pulled.\r\n\r\nJoy sprang up in him as he felt the silver coin coming free. He had it\r\nthis time. The spirits might not have changed lead to silver, but they\r\nhad made him skillful. The tongs came out holding an eight-real silver\r\npiece dripping with blood. White Bear held it up for all to see.\r\n\r\nWolf Paw's eyes grew round. The people cried out in amazement. Even Owl\r\nCarver looked astonished.\r\n\r\nDelighted with the effect, White Bear wiped the blood from the Spanish\r\ndollar carefully with the rag from Nancy's dress. It shone in the\r\nafternoon sunlight, the head of the King of Spain on one side along with\r\na Latin inscription and the date 1823. On the other side, a coat of\r\narms.\r\n\r\nPerfect! Now, he thought with pleasure, the braves and warriors and\r\ntheir wives would be more reluctant than ever to challenge him. And that\r\nmeant Nancy would be safer.\r\n\r\nHe held the coin before Wolf Paw's face. \"The form is the form of a pale\r\neyes coin, but this is a gift from the spirits.\"\r\n\r\nWolf Paw, slowly sitting up, took the coin and said, \"I will wear it\r\naround my neck. Maybe it will be a charm against more wounds.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let it remind you that it is honorable to treat prisoners kindly,\" said\r\nWhite Bear. He kept his face grave, but within he was bubbling over with\r\ntriumph.\r\n\r\nAfter stuffing the wound with buzzard's down and giving Wolf Paw herb\r\ntea to drink, White Bear sent him on his way. The brave stumbled off,\r\nleaning on Running Deer. White Bear stood up, stretched his tired arms\r\nand legs and turned to the doorway of his wickiup.\r\n\r\nA painful moment of doubt assailed him. Was this what the way of the\r\nshaman came to, then? Trickery? Perhaps his visions, too, were only\r\ndreams. No, the White Bear spirit was real. He had seen the paw print\r\nbeside his father's body. He bore the claw marks on his chest.\r\n\r\nHe had to force himself to stoop down, to step through the low doorway\r\nand face Nancy. He felt tremulous within. Whatever horrors Nancy had\r\nseen and endured, she would surely blame them on him. In all his paint\r\nand ornaments he was too obviously a Sauk.\r\n\r\nAnd how would his efforts to protect Nancy and win her trust make\r\nRedbird feel? How could he make her truly understand what was between\r\nhim and Nancy--and what was not?\r\n\r\nHe was not sure that he himself understood it.\r\n\r\nIn the light from the open doorway he saw Nancy, crouched on the\r\nopposite side of the round hut, trembling, still wrapped in the blanket\r\nRedbird had put on her. Redbird and Eagle Feather were sitting silently\r\nagainst the curving wall.\r\n\r\nHe sat down facing Nancy and she drew away, shuddering.\r\n\r\nHe said, \"Don't be afraid of me, Nancy. I know I look strange to you.\r\nI'm the shaman, the medicine man, for my people.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your people!\" she burst out. \"Your people murdered my father!\"\r\n\r\nHe had been afraid of that. He bowed his head and closed his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Nancy. I'm sorry.\"\r\n\r\n_What a ridiculous, futile thing to say._\r\n\r\n_I must know what happened at Victor. Nancy's father was killed. Who\r\nelse?_\r\n\r\nWhite Bear said, \"Nancy, I don't ask you to forgive me for what my\r\npeople did to you. But I did try to stop all this from happening. I pray\r\nyou'll let me tell you how I tried to make peace. And you are safe now\r\nas long as you stay with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Safe with you? Here?\" She shuddered. \"If I mean anything at all to you,\r\nyou've got to help me to get away.\"\r\n\r\nHis heart sank. The one thing he was sure he could not do was have her\r\nset free.\r\n\r\n\"That will be hard.\"\r\n\r\n\"I heard you talking to them. You were ordering them to leave me alone,\r\nand they did. Tell them to let me go. Auguste, I'll go mad. I'm so\r\nfrightened!\"\r\n\r\nShe clutched at his arm. He could feel her fear pouring into his arm up\r\nto his heart. He put his hand on top of hers and held it firmly. He\r\nwanted to take her in his arms to comfort her, but Redbird's eyes were\r\non him, and she would not understand. So he just patted Nancy's hand and\r\nreleased it.\r\n\r\nHe told Redbird what he had been saying to Nancy.\r\n\r\n\"Does she not see that the braves would kill you if you tried to set her\r\nfree?\" Redbird asked.\r\n\r\n\"She is too frightened to see anything,\" he said, and turned back to\r\nNancy.\r\n\r\n\"The only man who can free you is Black Hawk. I'll try to convince him\r\nthat he should, but he is away with a war party now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Killing more innocent men and women and children?\" Her teeth and eyes\r\ngleamed in the faint light within the wickiup.\r\n\r\nHer words left a hollow ache in his chest, but he went on speaking\r\ndoggedly.\r\n\r\n\"When he comes back, I'll go to him. Meanwhile, ask your God to help you\r\nbe brave.\"\r\n\r\nShe let go of his arm abruptly. \"What do you know about my God, with\r\nyour paint and your feathers and your magic wand?\"\r\n\r\nHer words hurt, and he was about to answer angrily, but he told himself\r\nshe was half mad with terror and grief.\r\n\r\n\"Because I have these things I can help you,\" he said gently. \"But I\r\nwant so much to know what happened at Victor. Can you bear to tell me?\"\r\n\r\nShe took his arm again. \"I'd just gotten dressed to go out and feed the\r\nanimals--when I saw the Indians riding toward our house. So many of\r\nthem! I knew right away. I ran into the house and woke Father. By the\r\ntime they got to the house he was standing in the doorway. He never even\r\ngot his rifle loaded, Auguste. Before he could move there was an arrow\r\nin his chest.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear knew that Reverend Hale had never liked him; but he was\r\nNancy's father, and to see her father killed--how that must hurt her!\r\n\r\n\"He was a good man,\" he said. \"He never did harm to our people. It is\r\nwrong that he died.\"\r\n\r\nNancy went on, sobbing softly. \"I must have fainted. I remember a ride,\r\nI was thrown over the back of a horse, then we were at Victoire.\r\nAuguste, they--they just overran Victoire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did anyone get away?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think the people at Victoire must have seen our church and the farms\r\nburning, so they had some warning. I couldn't see much. I was left tied\r\non the horse while they attacked. I did see them chase one woman and run\r\na spear through her. It was over very quickly. They set fire to\r\nVictoire.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear swallowed hard.\r\n\r\nHe saw the château with its magnificent hall and its great sweeping\r\nroof. There he had lived and learned so much from Grandpapa and Father.\r\nTheir hopes, their lives, had gone into that great house. And the men\r\nand women of Victoire, kindly, cheerful hard-working people--Marchette\r\nPerrault, Registre and Bernadette Bosquet. They may not have tried to\r\nstop Raoul from seizing the estate, but they had, most of them, loved\r\nElysée and Pierre and Auguste de Marion.\r\n\r\nThe pain in his chest spread till it seemed to fill his whole world,\r\nhammering at him inside and out.\r\n\r\nNancy said, \"Then they rode on to Victor, taking me with them.\"\r\n\r\nHe choked as he asked, \"Did they burn Victor down too?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, as they left.\"\r\n\r\nA voice seemed to echo inside him like a scream in a huge, empty hall.\r\n\r\n_Nicole! Frank! Grandpapa!_\r\n\r\n\"Can you tell me--my family--were any of them hurt?\"\r\n\r\nNancy said, \"I think the people at Victor got into the trading post\r\nbefore the Indians got there. There were men on the palisade shooting at\r\nthe Indians. The leader, the one with the red crest on his head, tied me\r\nto a tree. I had to watch it all.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is called Wolf Paw. He is Black Hawk's son.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope the Army gets him and hangs him from the highest gallows in\r\nIllinois. He left me tied to that tree all day while they tried to take\r\nthe trading post.\"\r\n\r\nThe words tumbled out faster and faster. When she had first regained\r\nconsciousness she could hardly speak at all. Now her eyes glittered and\r\nshe moved her hands violently. Hysteria had broken through her former\r\nnumbness.\r\n\r\n\"I could see them using ropes to climb the palisade and charging in\r\nthrough the front gate. Every so often they would pull out some dead or\r\nwounded. Just before sunset the one you call Wolf Paw made a speech to\r\nthem. Then they set fire to arrows and shot them at the blockhouse, and\r\nthey all rushed in through the front gate. I thought that would be the\r\nend, but then I heard a tremendous explosion. I thought maybe somebody\r\nblew up the blockhouse. A big puff of smoke rose up over the palisade.\r\nWolf Paw came out wounded. That very big man helped him put me on his\r\nhorse and tie me there. And then we rode for four days till we got\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste began to breathe easier. He felt some relief, some hope, despite\r\nhis pain for the loss of Victoire and for the people who had died there.\r\nIt sounded as if many of the people of Victor, perhaps Nicole and her\r\nfamily, perhaps Grandpapa, might have come through unharmed.\r\n\r\nBut another fear took a grip on him. \"On the way here, did Wolf Paw ...\r\nhurt you, Nancy?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. I think he was too tired and too badly hurt to want to do anything\r\nlike that. We rode hard, and he kept me tied on his horse all the time.\r\nWe stopped to sleep long after dark and started riding again before\r\nsunup. There was always at least one man awake to guard me.\"\r\n\r\nAll the while she had been talking, Nancy had kept a tight grasp on his\r\narm. Now he gently pulled away from her and stood up.\r\n\r\n\"Nancy, I must leave you for a while.\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" Her voice was shrill with fear.\r\n\r\n\"I must. There are many wounded who need me.\"\r\n\r\nFearful of how she would react to what he was going to say next, he\r\nhesitated. Then he spoke quickly to get it over with, as he did when he\r\nhad to hurt a patient. \"This is my wife, Redbird. She will care for\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your wife?\" Even in the semidarkness of the wickiup White Bear could\r\nsee pain in her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\" He had no time now to ease her suffering on that score.\r\n\r\nHe turned to Redbird and said in Sauk, \"Do what you can for her. She saw\r\nher father and many others of her people killed.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must know who she is,\" said Redbird, fixing him with her slanting\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nHe laid a reassuring hand on her shoulder. \"Have no fear. I will tell\r\nyou everything, tonight. See that she eats. Give her maple sugar. Help\r\nher to rest.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear spent the rest of the day moving through the wickiups under\r\nthe trees with his Sauk medicine bag and his bag of pale eyes surgical\r\ninstruments. Wolf Paw had brought back many wounded braves. Together\r\nwith Sun Woman and Owl Carver, White Bear treated those he could and\r\nmade the dying more comfortable. He went to the families of the braves\r\nand warriors who had been killed and tried to comfort them, performing\r\nrituals that helped them let their loved ones go, to walk west on the\r\nTrail of Souls.\r\n\r\nBy late afternoon White Bear was sick with disgust at the suffering and\r\ndeath this war had brought, and wanted nothing more than to go off by\r\nhimself and weep for his people. Wolf Paw's raid had brought back cattle\r\nand horses, but nearly two dozen men had died and an equal number were\r\nbadly hurt.\r\n\r\n_And all for what? To make the long knives hate us more._\r\n\r\nAt sunset another war party thundered in, this one led by Black Hawk\r\nhimself, with the Winnebago Prophet riding beside him. And more wounded\r\nmen to treat.\r\n\r\nIn the cool of the evening a delicious scent crept into White Bear's\r\nnostrils, one that neither he nor any of the British Band had smelled\r\nfor far too long--roasting beef. Now that it was dark and smoke from\r\nfires could no longer be seen, people were roasting the cattle Wolf Paw\r\nhad brought from Victoire. There were so many empty bellies to feed,\r\nthey had probably butchered all the steers.\r\n\r\n_By rights those are my steers_, White Bear thought wryly. _Raoul stole\r\nthem from me, and Wolf Paw stole them from Raoul._\r\n\r\nWhite Bear saw many small fires throughout the camp. In time of peace a\r\nfeast like this would call for one big fire, but that would send up a\r\nglow that could be seen from a distance.\r\n\r\nHe felt a surge of resentment when he saw how calm and contented Black\r\nHawk looked, sitting at a fire before his wickiup, chewing on strips of\r\nbeef his wife had laid before him on a mat.\r\n\r\nUntil today the people had been on the verge of starvation. And scouts\r\nhad reported that an army of over two thousand long knives was working\r\nits way up the Rock River toward them. How could Black Hawk bear the\r\nresponsibility for bringing so much anguish down on his people?\r\n\r\nTo White Bear's disappointment, the Winnebago Prophet sat next to Black\r\nHawk. At the sight of Flying Cloud, with his long, greasy hair and the\r\nmustache that looked something like Raoul's, White Bear's shoulders\r\nslumped. He felt an impulse to turn away, and seek Black Hawk out\r\nanother time.\r\n\r\nThe Prophet's Winnebago followers were long since gone, but the Prophet\r\nhimself was still predicting mighty victories over the long knives.\r\nWhite Bear remembered a scripture reading he'd heard at St. George's,\r\nthat false prophets would arise at the end of the world. This might well\r\nbe the end of the world for the Sauk; they certainly had their false\r\nprophet.\r\n\r\nBut a talk with Black Hawk about Nancy was too important to put off.\r\nWhite Bear sat down, silently facing Black Hawk. He waited for the war\r\nleader to speak to him.\r\n\r\nHe felt ravenously hungry watching the two men chew their beef. He\r\nhimself had not had time to eat.\r\n\r\nBlack Hawk's strong hand stroked the leather cover of one of the law\r\nbooks he had captured at Old Man's Creek.\r\n\r\n\"You healed my son and drew spirit silver from his body,\" Black Hawk\r\nsaid. \"Accept my thanks.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am happy to have made Black Hawk happy.\"\r\n\r\nBlack Hawk gestured toward the beef. \"Share my food.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear picked up a strip of meat, still hot. Saliva seemed to flood\r\nhis mouth. He chewed ferociously, closing his eyes for an instant in\r\npleasure. Black Hawk smiled slightly, while Flying Cloud, paying no\r\nattention to White Bear, gnawed on a rib.\r\n\r\nAfter a time during which White Bear could think of nothing but the hot,\r\njuicy meat, Black Hawk called him back to his reason for coming here.\r\n\r\n\"I am told you have a pale eyes woman prisoner.\"\r\n\r\n\"I came to speak to you about her,\" White Bear said, and silently asked\r\nhis spirit self to help him persuade Black Hawk to let her go.\r\n\r\nHe told Black Hawk how he had convinced the people not to kill her.\r\n\r\n\"You did well,\" said Black Hawk. \"We must make the long knives respect\r\nus, not just fear us. Warriors should not torture and kill prisoners.\r\nThe great Shooting Star would never let his men torture prisoners.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear felt a glow of pleasure at Black Hawk's approval. He felt\r\nmore hopeful that Black Hawk might listen to him. He decided to plunge\r\nahead with his request.\r\n\r\n\"If we give this woman back to the pale eyes, maybe they will talk peace\r\nwith us.\"\r\n\r\nThe Winnebago Prophet stopped eating long enough to say, \"Better to keep\r\nher. If the long knives attack us we can threaten to kill her.\"\r\n\r\nAware that Flying Cloud's argument made a kind of brutal sense, White\r\nBear felt a sinking in his chest.\r\n\r\nBlack Hawk pursed his wide mouth thoughtfully. \"The Prophet speaks\r\nwisely. It is foolish to give the woman to the long knives as a gift. We\r\nshould hold her until we are ready to trade her for something.\" He\r\nturned his sombre gaze on White Bear. \"You must keep her. You must not\r\nlet her escape.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear now had to go back to tell Nancy that the Sauk would not let\r\nher go. The thought of her terror and misery made him sick with sorrow\r\nfor her.\r\n\r\nAnd afraid for her too. Every day that the Sauk suffered hunger and\r\nillness, every time more men were killed, the women would want all the\r\nmore to hurt the one pale eyes who was in their power. And the men would\r\nhunger to take pleasure with her fair-haired beauty. He could not guard\r\nher at every moment. How, then, could he keep her safe?\r\n\r\nThey sat in silence again. The Winnebago Prophet looked pleased with\r\nhimself. Black Hawk was grim, probably brooding over how badly the war\r\nwas progressing.\r\n\r\nDesperate to protect Nancy, White Bear could think of only one way.\r\n\r\nHe said, \"I want to make the pale eyes woman my wife.\"\r\n\r\nBlack Hawk's eyebrows rose. \"Why should White Bear do that?\"\r\n\r\n\"The people will not kill the wife of a shaman.\"\r\n\r\nThe Winnebago Prophet burst out, \"This is wrong! The spirits have told\r\nme that our people must not mate with the pale eyes.\"\r\n\r\nBlack Hawk said, \"White Bear's father was a pale eyes.\"\r\n\r\n\"The offspring of an impure mating should not be a shaman,\" Flying Cloud\r\ngrumbled.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear felt his cheeks burn; the Winnebago Prophet might as well\r\nhave slapped him.\r\n\r\nHe remembered, so long ago it now seemed, though it was really only nine\r\nmonths, when Père Isaac, speaking at Pierre's funeral, had called White\r\nBear \"the fruit of sin.\" He had thought then that no red man would speak\r\nso demeaningly of his parentage, and here now was a shaman of the red\r\nmen who did.\r\n\r\nBlack Hawk said, \"White Bear has always been one of us. He has seen\r\nvisions. He has saved many lives. The mark of the Bear, one of the most\r\npowerful spirits, is on him. Let him do as he thinks best.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prophet said, \"The spirits have told me a man should not have more\r\nthan one wife.\"\r\n\r\nBlack Hawk glared at him. \"That is foolish talk. I have been content to\r\nhave one wife, Singing Bird. But my son, Wolf Paw, has two wives, and\r\nmany of our chiefs and braves have two or three wives. And when many men\r\ndie in battle, many women need to be cared for.\"\r\n\r\nFlying Cloud grunted and fell silent.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear took his leave of Black Hawk and threaded his way among the\r\nshelters and past the small campfires where beef was still roasting on\r\nspits.\r\n\r\nRedbird must agree to his plan before he could tell it to Nancy. He was\r\nafraid; afraid that she would say no, and afraid that his request would\r\nhurt her.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached his wickiup he called Redbird out, and they walked\r\nthrough the camp together.\r\n\r\n\"Sun Woman is with the yellow-haired woman in the wickiup,\" Redbird\r\nsaid. \"Sun Woman speaks to her in the pale eyes' language that she\r\nlearned from your father. I think the yellow-hair is not so frightened\r\nanymore.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is good,\" said White Bear gloomily, \"because Black Hawk says she\r\nmust remain a prisoner.\"\r\n\r\nRedbird sighed. \"I feared he would say that.\"\r\n\r\nThey climbed a low hill north of the camp and sat on a huge half-buried\r\nboulder overlooking a small lake. A newly risen crescent moon was\r\nreflected in the still black water.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear put his hand on Redbird's belly and felt the movement of the\r\nchild within her.\r\n\r\nRedbird said, \"What is this woman to you?\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear stiffened. Would she understand? Would she believe him?\r\n\r\nWhite Bear searched his mind for a way to explain. \"She was a friend to\r\nme when I lived at Victor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was she your woman?\" Redbird asked.\r\n\r\n\"No. She wanted to be, but I would not let it happen, because I knew\r\nthat one day I must leave her.\"\r\n\r\n_And I feared that if I let myself love Nancy I would never return to my\r\npeople, and to you._\r\n\r\n\"You did not even lie with her?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would be foolish to believe that.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would tell you if I had done that. I did want to, and she wanted to,\r\nbut I would not. Does it make you hate her to know she wanted that of\r\nme?\"\r\n\r\nRedbird's head was bowed so that he could not see her face. \"You are a\r\nman many women would want. I cannot hate them all.\"\r\n\r\n\"When I asked you to untie Nancy today and take her to our wickiup, you\r\ncould have refused me, as Running Deer did to Wolf Paw. Then the women\r\nwould have cut her to pieces. I could not have stopped them. I thank you\r\nfor honoring my wishes.\"\r\n\r\nRedbird said, \"You would have tried to stop them, and you would have\r\nbeen hurt. I did not want that to happen.\" She looked up at him\r\nsuddenly, smiling. \"And I knew that people would say, 'See, White Bear's\r\nwife does as he asks, but Wolf Paw's wife makes him look foolish.' It\r\nfelt good to make Wolf Paw look foolish, after what he did to us.\"\r\n\r\nIt warmed him to hear her say \"us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now I want to do something more for her,\" he said. \"But I can only do\r\nit if you will say yes to it.\" He held his breath.\r\n\r\nRedbird said, \"If you made her your wife, then no one in the band would\r\ndare to hurt her.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear let out a deep sigh. He should have known her thoughts would\r\nmove as swiftly as his own. He had wondered how to say it to her, and\r\nshe had said it for him.\r\n\r\n\"Only to protect her. Not to be truly my wife. Will you consent?\"\r\n\r\nShe stroked the back of his hand. \"I think it would be a good thing if\r\nwe keep her safe. You and I did not want our people to fight and kill\r\nthe pale eyes.\" She pressed her warm hand against his. \"At least we can\r\nkeep them from killing this one.\"\r\n\r\nThe ripples on the lake reflected fragments of moonlight. White Bear\r\nfelt he could see his love for Redbird, and it looked like what lay\r\nbefore him--a lake of silver. He leaned against her, and her back rested\r\nagainst his arm.\r\n\r\n\"I promise you I will not bed with her.\"\r\n\r\nShe smiled at him again. \"Why promise that?\"\r\n\r\nThe question surprised him. \"You are my true wife and the only wife I\r\nwant.\" He recalled Black Hawk's loyalty to Singing Bird. That was the\r\nright way to live.\r\n\r\nRedbird said, \"If you do go to her in the night, I will understand.\r\nEspecially now when I am so big and we cannot get together easily. I\r\nbelieve you when you say you love me more than her. But she is tall and\r\nhas hair like gold and very white skin, and I am small and have brown\r\nskin. Perhaps the pale eyes in you would prefer her.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think the pale eyes in me and the Sauk in me are one. And that one\r\nprefers you.\"\r\n\r\nShe took his hand and moved it down her body till he felt the warm, soft\r\nplace whence, in little more than a moon, their baby would emerge.\r\n\r\n\"I want to do this with you now,\" she whispered. \"I think we can, if you\r\ngo into me only a little way.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Redbird and White Bear returned to their wickiup, the crescent moon\r\nhad reached the high point of its trail across the sky. Within the\r\nsimple shelter he and Redbird had built, it was too dark to see anyone.\r\n\r\nHis mother's voice whispered, \"Eagle Feather and Yellow Hair are\r\nsleeping. She is terribly frightened, but she has been through so much\r\nshe is exhausted.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thank you for helping her,\" White Bear whispered. \"In the morning I\r\nmust tell her that Black Hawk will not let her go.\"\r\n\r\n\"That makes me sad for her,\" said Sun Woman. \"She is in such misery. I\r\nsense a strength in her, but this is a very bad time for her. You must\r\nnot stop being kind to her, not even for a moment.\"\r\n\r\nSun Woman ducked out through the doorway of the wickiup.\r\n\r\nNancy was sleeping in Redbird's bed. Redbird and White Bear lay down\r\ntogether on his pallet of reeds and blankets, her back against his\r\nchest, and slept.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen White Bear's eyes opened, the faint light filtering through the\r\nlayer of bark overhead let him see a figure sitting up across from him.\r\nOutside, he heard the sounds of the camp stirring, men and women calling\r\nto one another, horses stamping.\r\n\r\nHe felt a rush of pity as he recognized Nancy. What she must be feeling\r\nat this moment!\r\n\r\n\"Oh my God,\" he heard her say. \"Lord Jesus, help me.\" It must have taken\r\nher a moment to realize where she was.\r\n\r\n\"Nancy,\" he said, trying to keep his voice calm and pleasant, \"come with\r\nme and let us talk.\"\r\n\r\nThey left the wickiup and she walked through the camp with her eyes on\r\nthe ground, too frightened, he supposed, to look about her. People\r\nstared, but White Bear wore a forbidding look, and they kept their\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nShe had on a doeskin dress that Sun Woman had given her, and she had\r\ndone up her two blond braids the way she always had. He felt a little\r\ncatch in his throat as he looked at her and remembered those\r\nnot-accidental meetings on the prairie near Victoire.\r\n\r\nEvery so often as they walked along she twisted her shoulders inside the\r\nsoft leather and rubbed her arms uncomfortably. They passed a group of\r\nwarriors who had felled a big oak tree and were burning and scraping its\r\ninside to make a dugout. The men stopped work to watch her go by.\r\n\r\nSeeing the way they looked at her, White Bear thought, _Yes, she must\r\nmarry me_. He hoped he could persuade her that it would be the only way\r\nfor her to be safe.\r\n\r\nHe led her to the western edge of the high ground on which the band had\r\nmade their camp. They stopped when the earth underfoot turned soft and\r\nwet. Before them lay an expanse of reeds that vanished into morning\r\nmist.\r\n\r\n\"Did you talk to Black Hawk?\" she asked, her voice trembling. \"Can I get\r\naway from here?\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear remembered Sun Woman's admonition to be kind to Nancy at\r\nevery moment. He tried to think how best to tell her the bad news, how\r\nto add only the smallest possible amount of fear to her burden.\r\n\r\n\"Black Hawk is pleased that I stopped the people from hurting you\r\nyesterday,\" he began tentatively. \"He said the white men despise Indians\r\nwhen they kill their prisoners.\"\r\n\r\nHer lips trembled. \"He's not going to let me go, is he?\" she said, and\r\nsobs began to shake her body. When she was able, she turned pleadingly\r\ntoward him. \"Couldn't you do anything for me?\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear spread his hands helplessly. \"I talked to him as best I\r\ncould.\" He tried to tell her something encouraging. \"He just wants to\r\nkeep you until he can talk to the soldiers and make some kind of a\r\ntruce.\"\r\n\r\nShe drew away from him, her red-rimmed eyes wide. \"A truce? Does Black\r\nHawk really think he can make a truce? Don't you realize what _your\r\npeople_, your brave Indians, have been doing all over the frontier?\r\nBurnings and massacres everywhere. I told you what they did at Victor.\r\nDo you think the soldiers would ever be willing to talk peace with Black\r\nHawk now?\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear had listened to the returning warriors' tales of victories\r\nover the long knives at Kellogg's Grove, at Indian Creek, along the\r\nChecagou-Galena road. In despair he had realized that what the Sauk saw\r\nas battles in a war to defend their homeland were, to the white people\r\nof Illinois, bloody and abominable crimes. Who, after all, had Black\r\nHawk's war parties been killing? Some soldiers, but mostly farmers and\r\ntheir wives and children.\r\n\r\nIt tormented him now, as it did day and night, that no one could see the\r\nbloodshed as he did, with the eyes of both a white man and a Sauk. To\r\nhim, what the Sauk were doing was horrible, but it was done out of a\r\ndesperate need to cling to the land that meant life to them.\r\n\r\nAnd Nancy's capture showed him how much his years among the pale eyes\r\nhad changed him. Even if Wolf Paw had brought back a captive woman who\r\nwas a stranger to him, he would have tried to save her. Nor could he\r\nfeel that a people willing to torture any woman to death were fully\r\n_his_ people.\r\n\r\nNancy shook her head. \"There will be no truce, Auguste. They're coming\r\nto destroy you.\"\r\n\r\n\"We asked for peace,\" he began, \"before all this killing started. I went\r\nwith a white flag myself--\"\r\n\r\nHer chest heaved, and her face was a mottled red and white.\r\n\r\n\"They don't _want_ peace with you. Your braves will kill me when they\r\nrealize that. Or the soldiers will kill me when they kill all of your\r\npeople.\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" he cried, knowing the truth in her words and fighting the agony\r\nwithin.\r\n\r\n\"Let me go!\" she screamed.\r\n\r\nShe suddenly whirled away from him and threw herself into the reeds. She\r\ntried to run, and in a moment was in water up to her hips. Frantically\r\nbattering at the tall water grasses, she struggled to keep going. The\r\nmist was beginning to swallow her up.\r\n\r\nToo surprised to move, White Bear stood watching her for a moment. She\r\nwould surely die out there in the marsh, and she didn't realize it. He\r\nplunged into the marsh after her. He drove his legs through the cold\r\nwater. The mud sucked at his moccasins. By the time he caught up with\r\nher, he was barefoot.\r\n\r\nHe threw his arms around her. She thrashed about, turned and struck at\r\nhis face with her fists. Her eyes were wild, like a trapped fox's, her\r\ncheeks bright red, her mouth twisted and quivering.\r\n\r\n\"I've got to get away!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nancy, you can't.\" They were waist deep in water, and he felt his feet\r\nsinking into the mud.\r\n\r\nHe grabbed her shoulders and shook her as hard as he could. \"Listen to\r\nme!\"\r\n\r\nShe went limp in his arms, and he had to hold her up.\r\n\r\n\"I can't stay here. I won't let them kill me!\"\r\n\r\nHe pulled her toward dry ground, the cold water swirling around them,\r\nslimy mud tugging at their feet.\r\n\r\nWhen they were out of the water, dripping, he said, \"If there were any\r\nway you could escape from here, I'd help you. If you try to get away,\r\nyou'll die. There are miles of swamp in every direction. Only Black Hawk\r\nand a few braves know the way out. You'd drown or be buried alive in\r\nquicksand. Or the warriors would catch you, and they would kill you no\r\nmatter what I did. And they'll kill me if I help you try to escape.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll die if I stay here.\" Her eyes were dull with hopelessness.\r\n\r\n\"No, you won't. I'll take care of you. My family will protect\r\nyou--Redbird, Sun Woman, Owl Carver, Iron Knife. You'll be safe with\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nShe leaned against him. \"Auguste, I can't bear being so frightened. My\r\nheart is so full of fear it will burst.\"\r\n\r\n\"The band will not free you, but they will not hurt you. They respect\r\nme. I talk to the spirits for them and heal them.\"\r\n\r\nShe took a long look at him and spoke more calmly. \"You look so strange,\r\ndressed like a--like a--\"\r\n\r\n\"Like a real Indian?\" He tried giving her a little smile. For an instant\r\na little life came back into her face.\r\n\r\n_I can heal her fear, too, if she will let me._\r\n\r\nHe felt an inward glow as she managed to return a tremulous smile.\r\n\r\nShe said, \"But you're still that fine young gentleman who charmed me so,\r\nback at Victor, aren't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I'm that man too.\" He looked down at her bare feet. \"You've lost\r\nyour moccasins. We must get you another pair.\" And she was lucky not to\r\nhave a leech or two clinging to her feet; so was he. His moccasins were\r\nlost too. Clothing would be hard to come by, with the band on the run in\r\nstrange country, but he need not make her feel worse by telling her\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n\"I have to resign myself to staying with your people, don't I?\" she\r\nasked. \"Thank God you're here, Auguste. Maybe it was Providence that\r\nyour uncle stole your estate from you.\"\r\n\r\n_Yes, Earthmaker's way is surprising_, he thought.\r\n\r\n\"One thing I must ask of you, Nancy. For your protection, you and I must\r\ngo through a wedding ceremony. Then no one will be allowed to bother\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"A wedding!\" She let go of him and stepped away quickly.\r\n\r\nHis heartbeat quickened with anxiety over her apparent shock.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing to be afraid of. A simple ceremony.\" He recalled his wedding to\r\nRedbird last fall. He might be a shaman, but he'd not had the slightest\r\npremonition that he would go through the same ceremony with a different\r\nwoman less than a year later.\r\n\r\n\"But you already have a wife. That pretty little woman who is ...\r\nexpecting.\" She reddened. \"You told me she was your wife.\" Soaking wet,\r\nshe turned forlornly away from him.\r\n\r\n\"In our tribe men may have more than one wife.\"\r\n\r\nHe expected to see contempt in her eyes, her pale eyes' morality\r\noutraged.\r\n\r\nInstead she said sadly, \"Is she the reason you would not do what I\r\nwanted the night you left Victor? Were you married to her even then?\"\r\n\r\nHe had to force the words out. \"No, but I did love her even then. And\r\nshe-- That blue-eyed boy you've seen in our wickiup--he is our son. He\r\nwas born after my father took me to Victoire.\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head, the blond braids swinging. \"You were honest with me.\r\nYou didn't tell me about Redbird, but you didn't make a fool of me, as\r\nanother man might have. A man like your uncle. But how does your wife\r\nfeel about me?\"\r\n\r\nWhat did she mean, _A man like your uncle_? Had Raoul approached her? He\r\nput that question aside while he framed an answer to her question.\r\n\r\n\"Redbird agrees to this wedding. She, too, wants to help you. If you are\r\npart of our family you will be protected. She wants that.\"\r\n\r\nShe stared at him. \"But I'm a Christian! I can't go through a pagan\r\nwedding ceremony to be your _second wife_. How could I do that to my\r\nfather, a minister?\"\r\n\r\nHe tried to sound reassuring. \"We will all know, you and I and Redbird,\r\nthat it is not a real marriage. I've no doubt your Christian God will\r\nsee and understand. And your father, if he sees you, surely he wants you\r\nto live.\"\r\n\r\n_No, Philip Hale, as I remember him, might well expect her to die for\r\nher faith. He might well want his daughter to join him in the other\r\nworld. But never mind._\r\n\r\nHe went on quickly, \"Of course, you will not have to--know me, as your\r\nBible says. In the sight of the tribe you will be my wife, that is all.\r\nIn our wickiup your virtue will be respected.\"\r\n\r\nShe laughed ruefully, but tears were running down her cheeks. \"Oh,\r\nAuguste, remember how I begged you to marry me? I even prayed for it,\r\nwould you have imagined that? And now my prayer has been answered. Only\r\nit didn't turn out exactly the way I hoped, did it?\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear's heart filled up with a dark foreboding. Nothing had turned\r\nout as any of them hoped, but much had happened as they feared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n17\r\n\r\nUncle Sam's Men\r\n\r\n\r\nTears filled Raoul's eyes, blurring the newspaper and the letter on his\r\ncandlelit camp table. His hands were cold as a corpse's as he pressed\r\nthem against the sides of his head.\r\n\r\n_Oh, God! A drink! I need a drink!_\r\n\r\nHe reached for the jug beside the letter. A hand lifted the tent flap\r\nand Eli Greenglove slouched in.\r\n\r\nThe sight of him frightened Raoul. Did he know yet?\r\n\r\nNot much chance there'd be a letter for Eli in the sack of two-week-old\r\nmail that had just caught up with Raoul's battalion. No one in Victor\r\nlikely to write to Eli. Not now.\r\n\r\nEli's mouth was drawn hard. It was a hot night, and he wore no jacket,\r\nonly a plain brown calico work shirt, with a pistol and a knife at his\r\nwide brown belt.\r\n\r\n\"Levi Pope got a letter from his missuz. There was an Injun raid on\r\nVictor. You hear anything?\" Eli's voice was as flat as the prairie. He\r\nsat on Raoul's camp trunk.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" Raoul said, choking on the single word. \"A war party attacked\r\nVictoire.\"\r\n\r\nHe took a swallow from the jug. A cold, aching space was growing in the\r\npit of his stomach. The whiskey settled in the middle of the ache like a\r\ntiny campfire in the middle of a blizzard.\r\n\r\nHe handed the jug to Eli, and Eli sipped and put the jug back on the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n\"Goddammit, don't just sit there staring at me.\" Eli displayed his\r\nruined teeth as his lip curled back in a snarl. \"_What 'n hell\r\nhappened?_\"\r\n\r\nRaoul picked up the letter in a shaking hand and read aloud--horrible\r\nwords, written in a flowing black script.\r\n\r\n\"'It is my sad duty as your sister to send you the news that Clarissa\r\nGreenglove and your two sons have perished at the hands of Indians.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Lord God an' Savior,\" Eli groaned. His head fell back on his neck,\r\nhis mouth open. His Adam's apple stuck out.\r\n\r\n\"'Also that our beloved Victoire has burned to the ground.'\"\r\n\r\nRaoul went on:\r\n\r\n    \"Clarissa and Andrew and Philip, along with other people who lived\r\n    at Victoire and in Victor, were murdered on the morning of June\r\n    seventeenth.\r\n\r\n    \"In your sorrow, may it comfort you to know that your fortified\r\n    trading post, where we took shelter and defended ourselves, saved\r\n    the lives of most of us. The cannon that you set in the blockhouse\r\n    was employed to good effect, even though we hesitated at first to\r\n    use it, since no one here knew how to fire such a weapon.\r\n    Nevertheless, fire it we did, and broke the Indians' last charge and\r\n    drove them off.\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. Burke Russell, whom you placed in charge of the trading post,\r\n    was killed whilst fighting on the parapet. Mr. David Cooper, whom\r\n    you also appointed as caretaker, gave us the leadership and strength\r\n    we badly needed to see us through. He was the only experienced\r\n    fighting man among us.\r\n\r\n    \"I cannot bear to write more. The sights we saw when we came out of\r\n    the blockhouse will haunt my dreams forever.\r\n\r\n    \"Though the Indians could not lay hands on our bodies, they\r\n    destroyed our property. Our house was burned down and our printing\r\n    press and woodworking machines ruined.\r\n\r\n    \"When it was all over, Frank rode to Galena, though I begged him not\r\n    to, for fear there were Indians yet lurking about. But he must needs\r\n    publish his paper. He arranged to have an edition of the _Visitor_\r\n    printed on the press of the Galena _Miners Gazette_, and brought the\r\n    copies back here on a wagon. I am sending you a copy of the paper\r\n    under this cover. Frank's account will tell you everything there is\r\n    to know about the raid, and more perhaps than you would wish to\r\n    know.\r\n\r\n    \"Our father is well. He and Guichard fought bravely in our defense.\r\n\r\n    \"I do not reproach you. My heart goes out to you, Brother, for I\r\n    know you must be suffering. Remember that all happens as God\r\n    ordains. May He grant you peace.\"\r\n\r\n_What the hell does she mean, \"All happens as God ordains?\" God wanted\r\nmy woman and my kids murdered by Indians?_\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Christ Jesus,\" Eli said. He shook his head, then resting his elbows\r\non his knees, pressed his hands to the top of his head.\r\n\r\n_Even Papa had to fight._\r\n\r\nRaoul's heart felt bruised, as if beaten with a hammer.\r\n\r\n_I do not reproach you._ That was reproach enough. He had taken every\r\nman who would sign up for the militia. He had promised them their wives\r\nand children would be safe. He'd led them away in pursuit of Black Hawk,\r\nvengeance and glory.\r\n\r\nEli looked up. \"What does it say in the newspaper?\"\r\n\r\nRaoul started to hand it to him.\r\n\r\n\"You read it to me.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul had forgotten that Eli couldn't read. Clarissa couldn't either.\r\nNow she'd never learn. Nor would the boys.\r\n\r\nHe shook his head and brushed his hand across his forehead. \"I _can't_\r\nread this out loud.\"\r\n\r\nGreenglove's eyes were hard as bullets. \"You wipe your damned eyes and\r\nread that damned newspaper.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul rubbed his eyes and took another pull from the jug. Greenglove\r\nheld out his hand and Raoul passed him the jug.\r\n\r\nRaoul picked up the newspaper, hating the sight of it, and began to read\r\nthe column headed with the single word, MASSACRE!\r\n\r\nFrank's story told how the people in the trading post held the Indians\r\noff all day and finally drove them away by firing the cannon. Then came\r\nthe grievous task of finding and burying those who had not had time to\r\nreach safety.\r\n\r\nThen, for Raoul, the most dreadful lines of all:\r\n\r\n    In the ashes of Victoire, it appeared from examination of the\r\n    charred remains that the skulls of the men and women had been cloven\r\n    by tomahawk blows. Parts of the children's bodies were scattered\r\n    about the ruins, as if they had been chopped to bits before the\r\n    Indians set fire to the great house.\r\n\r\nWhy hadn't Clarissa gotten away? She'd taken to drinking heavily in the\r\nlast year, so much so that he'd had to hit her more than once for\r\nletting the boys run loose without keeping an eye on them. She had\r\nprobably been lying abed in a drunken stupor while everyone was fleeing\r\nthe château, the boys sleeping in the room with her. Hadn't anyone tried\r\nto wake them?\r\n\r\nThose faithful French servants who loved Elysée and Pierre so much, they\r\ndidn't give a damn about Raoul's whore and his bastard sons. After all,\r\nhe had thwarted Pierre's dying wishes. And he had struck his aged father\r\nwith his fist in front of all those Victoire people.\r\n\r\nStill, they'd have been human enough to try to do _something_. If they'd\r\nhad time. They'd holler and bang on the door. Try to wake them up. But\r\nthere wouldn't have been time. A hundred or more Indians galloping down\r\non the château. The servants who saw them coming would barely have time\r\nto get away. Some of them hadn't made it. Some of them had died with\r\nClarissa and the boys; maybe the ones who'd stayed behind to try to warn\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThat was how it must have been.\r\n\r\nFrank's article in the _Visitor_ said that some of the people in the\r\ndistant farms had saved themselves by hiding in root cellars or in\r\nnearby woods. The Indians were in too much of a hurry to get to Victor\r\nto bother searching carefully. One family, the Flemings, had ridden to\r\nthe shut-down lead mine. Some Indians pursued them to the mine but\r\ndidn't follow them in. The Flemings hid so deep in the mine they had\r\ntrouble finding their way out again, but they did survive.\r\n\r\nBut one person had neither hidden nor been killed:\r\n\r\n    While the body of the Reverend Philip Hale, D.D., was found in the\r\n    burnt wreckage of his house, his daughter, Miss Nancy Hale, has not\r\n    been found. It is feared Miss Hale may have been kidnapped by the\r\n    Indians. Both the church and the house Reverend Hale built on the\r\n    prairie were burned down.\r\n\r\nAs Raoul read aloud the list of the dead, he thought of Nancy and then\r\nof his sister Helene. Did they do _that_ to Nancy? The red devils!\r\nProbably did. Horrible!\r\n\r\nHe saw the naked, slashed, violated body lying on the prairie. Nancy\r\nHale's body. Just like Helene's.\r\n\r\nBut it could be, too, she was alive. And if he kept after Black Hawk, he\r\nmight be the one to rescue her. There was comfort in that.\r\n\r\nA little comfort.\r\n\r\nAnd then a black bile of hatred for himself trickled up into his throat.\r\n\r\nGreat God in Heaven, this man he was sitting with--he'd had this man's\r\ndaughter in his bed for six years. And now she was murdered. And already\r\nhe was figuring how to replace her.\r\n\r\n_Maybe I am as bad a man as Papa said I was._\r\n\r\n_That's what Nicole meant by \"All happens as God ordains.\" This was to\r\npunish me._\r\n\r\nHe took a drink to wash that thought away.\r\n\r\nHe winced when he came to the name Marchette Perrault on the list of\r\ndead. Maybe she had died trying to help Clarissa. Did Armand know yet?\r\n\r\nEli stood up. \"Well, poor Clarissa. Poor little boys. It was a black day\r\nin our lives when Clarissa and me met up with you, Raoul de Marion.\"\r\n\r\nThe words tore at a wound that was fresh and bleeding.\r\n\r\n\"Look here, now, Eli. Don't you know that I feel as bad as you do?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I don't know that. Clarissa was all I had in the world. I kept\r\nhoping you'd find it in your heart to marry her, but you never treated\r\nher decent. Never cared enough for them kids to give them your name.\r\nYour brother, he did more for that half-Injun son of his than you did\r\nfor your two that was all white.\"\r\n\r\n_All white they were, but half Puke_, Raoul thought, feeling his disdain\r\nfor the man who stood slumped before him.\r\n\r\nPuke, a good nickname for Greenglove's breed. Missouri puked up the\r\nworst of its people, and they landed in Illinois. Clarissa's breasts\r\nflattening and sagging, her shoulders round, her teeth stained by pipe\r\nsmoke. So slatternly she'd gotten to be, he hardly cared to take her to\r\nbed. And Phil and Andy growing up with that same washed-out, weak-boned\r\nGreenglove look.\r\n\r\n_How could I think that way about my own kids? What kind of a man am I?\r\nAnd now they've been murdered, and I'm still despising them._\r\n\r\nHe had to quit this. He was torturing himself. Wasn't it bad enough? It\r\nwas the goddamned Indians he should be hating.\r\n\r\n\"We'll have our revenge, Eli. We'll kill a hundred Indians for each of\r\nours who died.\"\r\n\r\n\"Like you murdered them three at Old Man's Creek. I warned you not to do\r\nthat. That was what got Clarissa and her kids killed. I won't be helping\r\nyou get your vengeance, Colonel Raoul de Marion. Because if I did stay\r\naround you, sooner or later I'd want blood for blood of mine that's been\r\nspilled.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul felt a chill, facing Greenglove's implacable, dull-eyed hatred.\r\nBut he was damned if he'd back down before this human weed.\r\n\r\n\"You'll leave this company when your term of enlistment is up and not\r\none damned day sooner. You're captain of the Smith County company.\"\r\n\r\nGreenglove's mouth curled in a cold smile.\r\n\r\n\"By tomorrow there won't be any company. The Smith County boys heard\r\nabout what happened at Victor. Most of them'll be quitting.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul felt the heat rising in his neck and head.\r\n\r\n\"The hell they will! My Smith County boys will want Indian blood just\r\nlike I do. And just like you would if you hadn't taken a notion to blame\r\nClarissa's death on me.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste. The half-breed. Raoul felt his blood boiling as he saw the\r\nolive-skinned face mingling Pierre's features with Indian looks. The\r\nface he'd never stopped hating from the moment he first saw it. Auguste\r\nwas dead. Eli, here, had shot him. His body was rotting away somewhere\r\non the prairie behind them.\r\n\r\nBut the Indians of the British Band were alive--Auguste's people. They\r\nsnuck up on Victoire, Raoul's home. Burned it to the ground. Tomahawked\r\nhis woman. Chopped his children, his two boys, Andy and Phil, to pieces.\r\n\r\nTo pieces.\r\n\r\nHe saw that, for a moment, too vividly, and almost screamed. He grabbed\r\nthe jug and burned the bloody picture out of his mind with a swallow.\r\n\r\nAuguste's band, skulking around up the river somewhere.\r\n\r\nWhy, Auguste might have given them the idea. Told them all about\r\nVictoire and Victor. Lots of helpless women and children there. A rich\r\ntrading post. A big white man's house to burn down.\r\n\r\n_My uncle kicked me off the land_, Auguste might have said. _Avenge me.\r\nGo kill his woman and his children and burn his house down. And while\r\nyou're at it, kill every one of those white dogs in Smith County._\r\n\r\nSure, he probably put the idea in those devils' heads before he got\r\nshot.\r\n\r\nIt hadn't been enough to kill Auguste. Wasn't enough.\r\n\r\nHe had to kill off every last one of Black Hawk's Indians. Exterminate\r\nthe whole band--bucks, squaws and papooses.\r\n\r\nAnd he would shoot any shirker who refused to go with him.\r\n\r\nGreenglove shrugged. \"Go chase Injuns, then, if that's your heart's\r\ndesire.\" Then he smiled in a knowing way Raoul found strangely\r\ndisturbing. \"But you'll maybe find a surprise waiting for you up there\r\nin Michigan Territory. Almost makes me want to stay with you, just so's\r\nI could see the look on your face.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul felt a chill. Why the hell was Greenglove grinning like that?\r\n\r\n\"Damn you, you can't just walk off, Eli! You took an oath. You signed up\r\nfor another thirty days when your enlistment was up in May. I can have\r\nyou shot for desertion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go ahead. Shoot me yourself.\"\r\n\r\nEli slowly raised the tent flap and stood there a moment, turning to\r\ngive Raoul one last, strange, unmirthful smile. Raoul eyed the pistol at\r\nEli's belt. Most likely all primed and loaded. His own pistol, unloaded,\r\nwas hanging from a tent pole behind him.\r\n\r\n_If I went for my pistol, that'd give him an excuse to put a ball in me.\r\nAnd he'd do it before I could even get a damned cap in place._\r\n\r\nEli gave Raoul one final nod, as if he knew what Raoul had been\r\nthinking, and let the tent flap fall behind him.\r\n\r\nRaoul reached for the jug. It felt light in his hand, and he shook it.\r\nEmpty.\r\n\r\nEverything. Empty, empty, empty!\r\n\r\nHe got up, weaving slightly, and walked to the opening of the tent.\r\n\r\n\"Armand!\" he shouted.\r\n\r\n_Oh my God, now I'll have to give Armand the news about Marchette._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRaoul awakened, sweating. One side of his tent was glowing white, the\r\nsun beating down on it; he had been sleeping in an oven. He sat up, and\r\nhis vision went black and his head spun. He swung his feet, still in\r\ndirty gray stockings, over the side of his cot. He nearly stepped on\r\nArmand, who was lying flat on his back on the straw-covered floor, his\r\nbeard fluttering as he snored through his open mouth.\r\n\r\nStanding, Raoul saw Nicole's letter and the _Victor Visitor_ lying on\r\nhis camp table beside a burned-down candle and four empty jugs. He\r\nremembered what had happened at Victor. He fell back onto his cot and\r\npounded his fist on his chest, trying to numb the pain in his heart.\r\n\r\n_God damn the Sauk! Damn them! Damn them!_\r\n\r\nArmand, when he learned what happened at Victoire, had not blamed Raoul\r\nas Eli had. He'd wept over Marchette--whom he'd beaten almost daily when\r\nshe was alive--and had sworn vengeance on her murderers, the British\r\nBand. And he had sat with Raoul till both of them were drunk enough to\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nRaoul's head and body felt as if they were on fire. His fingers curled,\r\ngrasping at empty air.\r\n\r\nHe buckled on his belt with his pistol and his Bowie knife, stumbled out\r\nof his tent and stood beside it, pissing in the tall grass.\r\n\r\nHe was facing the Rock River, less than a quarter-mile wide here, a\r\nsheet of sparkling blue water bordered by forest. Lined up along the\r\nbank before him were a dozen big box-shaped flatboats. The tents of his\r\nown militia battalion and of two others were spread over the grassland\r\naround him.\r\n\r\nHe suddenly sensed that something was wrong. He hadn't heard the bugler\r\nblow the dozen notes signaling the start of the day. He saw now that the\r\nmen weren't assembled but were wandering aimlessly about the camp.\r\n\r\nWhat the hell was it Greenglove had said?\r\n\r\n_By tomorrow there won't be any company._\r\n\r\nDown near the flatboats a big crowd was gathered. One man, standing on a\r\nbarrel, was addressing them. His voice, shrill and insistent, carried to\r\nRaoul on the warm June air, but he couldn't make out what the man was\r\nsaying.\r\n\r\nRaoul didn't like this. He didn't like this at all.\r\n\r\nHe started walking toward the river and found Levi Pope and Hodge Hode\r\nsquatting in front of a fire, making coffee simply by boiling water with\r\ncoffee grounds in it.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry for your loss, Colonel,\" said Pope.\r\n\r\nHearing Pope speak of what happened at Victoire was like being kicked in\r\na spot that was already bruised. Raoul had to pause a moment before he\r\ncould speak.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you. Your family come through all right?\" He dreaded what he\r\nmight hear in answer.\r\n\r\n\"Your sister wrote a letter for my missuz,\" Pope said. \"They came\r\nthrough tolerably. Thanks to the way you fortified the trading post.\r\nThat was mighty foresighted, Colonel.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul's chest expanded and he felt a little better. This was how he'd\r\nhoped the men would react, not blaming him for the tragedy as that\r\nbastard Greenglove had.\r\n\r\n\"Levi's letter told as how my boy Josiah made it to the trading post\r\ntoo,\" Hodge said. \"Mr. Cooper even let him do some shootin' at the\r\nredskins.\"\r\n\r\n_Mr. Cooper? Since when did David Cooper get to be so high and mighty?_\r\n\r\n\"I need some of that coffee,\" Raoul said. Hodge strained the grounds out\r\nof the coffee by pouring it through a kerchief into a tin cup and handed\r\nthe cup to Raoul.\r\n\r\nThe black liquid scalded Raoul's lips and tongue, and didn't treat him\r\nany better when it bit into his whiskey-burned stomach.\r\n\r\n\"Anything to eat?\"\r\n\r\nWith a bitter grunt, Levi Pope took a square biscuit out of a paper\r\nwrapper and held it out. \"These worm cakes is pretty lively, but dip 'em\r\nin the coffee a couple of times and you'll boil the little buggers to\r\ndeath.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul shut his eyes and waved the weevil-riddled hardtack away.\r\n\r\n\"What the hell is that bunch doing down by the river?\"\r\n\r\nHodge Hode grinned. \"They call it a 'pub-lic in-dig-nation' meeting.\" He\r\ndrawled out the words, amused. \"Say they won't go across the river into\r\nMichigan Territory. Say they want to go home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Any of our men talking that way?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, a heap of them, Colonel,\" said Levi.\r\n\r\n\"I'll see about that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hodge and me ain't quittin'. We won't go home till we've killed us some\r\nInjun trash.\" Levi lovingly stroked the handles of his six holstered\r\npistols, three on each side of his belt.\r\n\r\nBut Levi and Hodge made no move to get up and join Raoul. They would go\r\nwith him across the river, he saw, but they were not about to help him\r\ndiscipline the other men. He thought of ordering them to come with him,\r\nbut decided not to test their loyalty that far. Eli had walked out on\r\nhim. He didn't know who he could trust.\r\n\r\nHell, he could do it without these two, anyway.\r\n\r\nFor reassurance Raoul took a grip on the handle of his Bowie knife as he\r\napproached the crowd. Could he cow dozens of men if they were determined\r\nnot to obey him?\r\n\r\n_Sure. Might have to carve a few bellies, but the rest will fall into\r\nline._\r\n\r\nThat was how he ran Smith County.\r\n\r\nThe man standing on the barrel was saying, \"You know what the Injuns\r\ncall that country up there? The Trembling Lands. It's all swamp, water\r\nand quicksand. You take a horse out on what looks like solid ground,\r\nbefore you can blink, he sinks belly deep.\"\r\n\r\nThat kind of talk made Raoul want to use his knife. But that would\r\nprobably only rile these rebellious bastards all the more.\r\n\r\n_Got to put a stop to this. Line them all up by the boats. Tell the\r\nfirst man to get in. If he won't, shoot him. Then go on to the next.\r\nThat'll change their minds in a hurry._\r\n\r\nHe told himself disgustedly to quit dreaming. Not even in Smith County\r\ncould he get away with shooting white men just because they wouldn't\r\nobey him. Not in broad daylight, anyway.\r\n\r\nThe man standing on the barrel said, \"If Black Hawk has holed up in that\r\ncountry, that means he's finished. Hell, his people will starve to death\r\nup there. What do we got to follow him for?\"\r\n\r\nPushing his way through the crowd, Raoul heard a man near him call out,\r\n\"Volunteers is what we are. That means we serve at our own pleasure.\r\nWell, I'm not volunteering for any more.\"\r\n\r\nA chorus--\"Right!\" \"Yeah!\" \"Me neither!\" \"That's telling 'em!\"--rose all\r\naround Raoul, maddening him as a swarm of biting flies would madden a\r\nhorse.\r\n\r\nHe saw a familiar stoop-shouldered back in the crowd--Justus Bennett.\r\nEver since Old Man's Creek, Bennett had been whining about the fine suit\r\nof clothes and the two expensive law books he'd lost, demanding that the\r\nstate of Illinois pay for them. Now he was standing here, encouraging\r\nwould-be deserters just by listening to them.\r\n\r\nRaoul grabbed his shoulder and pulled him around. \"You're a lawyer. You\r\nknow damned well this meeting is illegal. Get over there with Pope and\r\nHode, or you're no more a lieutenant in my battalion.\"\r\n\r\nBennett stared back at him with beady eyes. \"That's immaterial, seeing\r\nas we're all going home.\"\r\n\r\n\"No one's going home,\" said Raoul, loud enough to make the men around\r\nhim turn to look. \"Get the hell back to your outfit.\"\r\n\r\nHe gave Bennett a shove. The lawyer glowered at him, but slunk away.\r\n\r\nRaoul pushed his way to the front of the crowd. The men fell back,\r\nmaking way for his blue jacket with its officer's gold stripes. But the\r\nsun beat down on his head. He realized that he had forgotten to put on\r\nhis hat, and he wasn't shaved and his jacket was unbuttoned.\r\n\r\nAnd, nothing. Hell, he could handle men. He didn't have to dress up for\r\nthat. He drew his knife and faced the man on the barrel.\r\n\r\n\"Get down off there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now listen, Colonel, this is a public meeting.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul waved the knife. \"You've had your say. Jump.\"\r\n\r\nThe man stared defiantly at Raoul. Raoul thought he might have to cut\r\nhim up a little, and wondered if he was up to it. The man's eyes wavered\r\nfrom Raoul's down to the thirteen-inch blade. And he jumped.\r\n\r\nBut he wasn't quite done talking. \"It's a free country, Colonel. Man's\r\ngot a right to speak his mind.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul said, \"Tell that to Black Hawk.\"\r\n\r\nHe wasn't quite sure what he meant by that, but he heard several\r\nchuckles and was encouraged.\r\n\r\nHe scrambled up on the three-foot-high barrel. It rocked under him, and\r\nthe dregs of whiskey sloshing around in his body made him feel dizzy. He\r\ndecided, after he got his feet set near the rim of the barrel, that he\r\nwould be safer if he sheathed his knife.\r\n\r\n\"You men's term of enlistment is not up. Any man who won't cross that\r\nriver is a coward and a deserter, and I'll see you're dealt with.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go to hell!\" one man shouted.\r\n\r\n\"You talk about cowards,\" another man called. \"Didn't your whole\r\nbattalion run all the way from Old Man's Creek to Dixon's Ferry, from\r\nforty Injun bucks?\"\r\n\r\n\"They don't call it Old Man's Creek no more,\" a raucous voice cried.\r\n\"Now it's de Marion's Run.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul pulled his knife again.\r\n\r\n\"The man who said that about de Marion's Run--come up here and say it\r\nagain.\" He shook the knife.\r\n\r\n\"Quit wavin' that pig sticker around and get down off that barrel, de\r\nMarion. We heard enough from you.\" Raoul saw a rifle pointed at him. The\r\nblood pumping through his body suddenly went from hot to cold.\r\n\r\nA new voice broke in.\r\n\r\n\"Lower that rifle!\"\r\n\r\nThe tone was deep, easy and confident in command. It offered no\r\nalternative. The rifle came down as quickly as if in response to a drill\r\nsergeant's order.\r\n\r\nA short, plump officer with thick black eyebrows came up to stand beside\r\nRaoul's barrel. He wore a stained, broad-brimmed wool hat and a blue\r\nArmy jacket over fringed buckskin trousers. The gold stripes on his\r\nupper arm identified him as a colonel. The saber at his side nearly\r\ndragged on the ground. He might have been comical looking, but somehow\r\nhe wasn't. Raoul had seen the officer at command meetings and knew that\r\ndespite his mixed dress, he was Regular Army. This morning, though, he\r\ncouldn't remember his name.\r\n\r\nMovement in the distance caught Raoul's eye. A long line of\r\nblue-uniformed troops was marching across the prairie about a hundred\r\nyards away, their shakoes bobbing. They came to a halt, turned and faced\r\nthe militiamen. They came to parade rest, each man with a rifle at his\r\nside. The morning sun glittered on bayonets.\r\n\r\nSome militiamen glanced over their shoulders at the line of Federal\r\nsoldiers, and a nervous muttering of \"Bluebellies!\" spread through the\r\ncrowd.\r\n\r\n\"You can get down from there now, Colonel de Marion,\" said the short\r\nofficer. \"I'd appreciate it if you'd let me handle this.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul hated to admit it to himself, but he was relieved. Crouching\r\nslowly and carefully, so as not to make an ass of himself by falling, he\r\nclimbed down from the barrel.\r\n\r\n\"That's Zachary Taylor,\" Raoul heard someone in the crowd say as he\r\nmoved, now unnoticed, to stand apart on the riverbank. Raoul felt\r\nfoolish that he had forgotten Taylor's name, especially when Taylor knew\r\nhis.\r\n\r\nInstead of standing on the barrel, Taylor hitched himself up and sat on\r\nit, gesturing in a friendly way to the men to gather around him.\r\n\r\nHe spoke with an easy southern drawl, but he made his voice carry.\r\n\r\n\"Now, men, I don't set myself up as your superior, even though I am a\r\nFederal officer. We're all equal Americans here.\" He nodded as if\r\nthinking something over. \"In fact, many of you are important men in\r\ncivilian life, and I have no doubt some of you will hold public office\r\nand be giving orders to _me_ some day.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul's eyes traveled over the crowd, and he noticed one figure taller\r\nthan most, eyes grave as he listened intently to Taylor. That Lincoln\r\nfellow, who had been such a nuisance at Prophet's Town. Raoul wondered\r\nif the young man was for or against crossing the Rock River today.\r\n\r\nTaylor said, \"The best assurance you have that I'll obey your orders\r\nwhen it comes your turn is that I'm obeying the orders I've got now. I\r\nwill tell you in a moment what those orders are. But let me refresh your\r\nmemory about what Black Hawk and his savages have done to the people you\r\nand I are sworn to defend.\"\r\n\r\nHe pulled a folded paper from the side pocket of his blue jacket and\r\nread from it.\r\n\r\n\"One man killed at Bureau Creek. One man at Buffalo Grove, another at\r\nthe Fox River. Two on the Checagou Road. A woman and two men killed on\r\nthe outskirts of Galena. Apple River Fort besieged, four dead. Seven men\r\nmassacred at Kellogg's Grove. Three whole families, fifteen people,\r\nwiped out at Indian Creek. Victor besieged, and seventeen men, women and\r\nchildren massacred.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul saw the shamefaced glances of men who knew him shift his way. He\r\nlooked down at the ground angrily. He didn't want these men pitying him.\r\n\r\nBut an image of burned and scattered flesh and bones reared up suddenly\r\nin his mind. It struck at him like a rattlesnake. He almost threw up. He\r\nclenched his fists and held himself rigid.\r\n\r\nOne man called out, \"Colonel Taylor, that's why we don't want to cross\r\nthe state line. The Indians are attacking all over the place, and we\r\nwant to be back home to protect our people.\"\r\n\r\nTaylor nodded. \"That's understandable. But I've been fighting Indians\r\nfor a long time. I came up against old Black Hawk nearly twenty years\r\nago in the war against the British. I've got a score to settle with him,\r\nbecause he whipped me then, and I promise you he will not whip _us_ this\r\ntime. Yes, that's wild country up there, no doubt about it. But we'll\r\nhave a band of Potawatomi scouts led by one of their chiefs, Billy\r\nCaldwell, to guide us. And General Winfield Scott is coming across the\r\nGreat Lakes with five hundred more Federal troops. With all that help,\r\nwe'll finish Black Hawk.\r\n\r\n\"And we must finish him. The murders and massacres will not stop as long\r\nas Black Hawk and his tribe are on the loose. If you go back to your\r\nfarms and settlements, there'll be a dozen of you in one place and\r\ntwenty in another. And one morning or night you'll find yourself facing\r\na war party of a hundred, hundred fifty braves, like the people at Apple\r\nRiver and Victor did. Our strength is in our numbers, and while we are\r\nthree thousand and more together, we've got to seek out the British Band\r\nof the Sauk and Fox and destroy them.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul heard a murmur of assent. His heart lifted. The little colonel was\r\nwinning them over, and the war would go on.\r\n\r\n\"In plain English, gentlemen and fellow citizens, my orders from\r\nWashington City are to pursue Black Hawk wherever he goes, and to take\r\nthe Illinois militia with me. I mean to do both. Now, there are the\r\nflatboats drawn up on the shore.\" He paused, then slid down from his\r\nperch on the barrel and, standing very straight, pointed over their\r\nheads. \"And here are Uncle Sam's men, drawn up behind you on the\r\nprairie.\"\r\n\r\nTaylor was so short that only the men near him could see where he was\r\npointing. They turned first, and then in an ever-widening ring the men\r\nin the farther reaches of the crowd turned to look at the long,\r\nblue-clad line stretched behind them like a chain.\r\n\r\nRaoul heard resignation in the militiamen's voices.\r\n\r\n\"Boys, I'm for the flatboats.\"\r\n\r\n\"Me too. I signed up to fight Injuns, not Americans.\"\r\n\r\nA man called out, \"Hell, Colonel, we're _all_ Uncle Sam's men.\"\r\n\r\nTaylor smiled, reached up to settle his mottled hat on his head, and\r\nsaid, \"Then I will be proud to lead you.\"\r\n\r\nHe strode through the assembly.\r\n\r\nAt the edge of the crowd he turned and raised his voice. \"Officers,\r\nassemble your men. We'll take the troops over first, then the horses. I\r\nwant everyone on the other side by noon.\"\r\n\r\nTaylor walked over to Raoul, squinted at him and sniffed audibly.\r\n\r\n\"You look like the backside of hell, sir. You been drinking this early\r\nin the day?\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't touched whiskey this morning,\" Raoul said, not adding that it\r\nwas only because when he woke up all the jugs in his tent were empty.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then you were drinking damned late last night. Appearing in front\r\nof these unruly men looking like a sot is no way to get them to obey\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul eyed the short colonel's mismatched uniform parts and wondered\r\nwhere he got the gall to criticize. But he wanted to be on this man's\r\ngood side.\r\n\r\n\"My wife and two sons were murdered by the redskins. At Victor. They've\r\nbeen dead for two weeks, and I just found out about it last night.\"\r\n\r\nTaylor reached out and gripped his arm. \"Damn! I am sorry, Colonel de\r\nMarion. I should have realized you might have lost loved ones there.\r\nI'll see that _you_ get leave to go home.\"\r\n\r\nBack to Victor? Raoul trembled at the thought of having to see the ruins\r\nof Victoire and the town--the graves of Clarissa and Phil and Andy.\r\nHaving to face people who, like Eli, might believe that he put them in\r\nharm's way. Besides, he had a mission to carry out. Kill Indians. And\r\nthere were no Indians to kill in Victor now.\r\n\r\n\"No, Colonel, no,\" he stammered. \"I want to go after Black Hawk's\r\npeople. We can't let them get away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor will we. General Atkinson and I were talking about that just\r\nyesterday--and about you, as it happens. You own a Mississippi\r\nsteamboat, don't you?\"\r\n\r\nPuzzled, Raoul answered, \"Yes, the _Victory_. It makes a regular run\r\nfrom St. Louis to Galena.\"\r\n\r\n\"We're certain that if we don't catch up with Black Hawk, wherever he's\r\nhiding up in the Michigan Territory, that he'll try to take his band\r\nwest, to the Mississippi. If he gets across it, we'll have a hell of a\r\ntime catching him.\" Taylor's eyes glinted hard as glass marbles. \"We are\r\ndetermined, Colonel, not to allow him to make a successful retreat. We\r\nhave to show all the tribes that they can't murder white people and then\r\nlight out for Indian country and get off scot-free.\"\r\n\r\nTaylor's words, now that the near-mutiny was over, lifted Raoul's heart.\r\nHe had left Victor in April hoping for revenge for Helene and for his\r\nown sufferings of years ago. But now there were more slaughtered\r\ninnocents to avenge--and now he had the army of the United States to\r\nhelp him do it.\r\n\r\n\"I'll do anything to get those redskins.\"\r\n\r\n\"With your ship patrolling the stretch of river where they're likely to\r\ncross, we could be sure that Black Hawk won't escape us.\"\r\n\r\n\"You want me to go back and get the _Victory_ ready?\" He felt himself\r\ntrembling again.\r\n\r\n\"For now you'll go along with us into the Michigan Territory,\" Taylor\r\nsaid. \"But if it looks as if Black Hawk is making a run for the\r\nMississippi, you'll see that we cut them off. The _Victory_, eh? Aptly\r\nnamed.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul's grieving, vengeful heart rejoiced. When the time came, he'd have\r\nthe cannon from the trading post mounted in the bow of the _Victory_.\r\nThen let any damned Indians try to cross the Mississippi. He'd pay them\r\nback for what they did to Victoire.\r\n\r\nBut he remembered Nicole and Frank coming to him, telling him the\r\nmilitia was needed to guard Victor. He'd laughed at their fears. If he'd\r\nlistened to them, Clarissa and Andy and Phil and those other people\r\nmight still be alive. Victoire and Victor would still be standing.\r\nHadn't he had some hand in bringing death and destruction upon his home?\r\n\r\nNo, it was all the Indians' doing.\r\n\r\n_I'll get you, Black Hawk. If I have to follow you all the way to\r\nHudson's Bay. There won't be a one of your damned British Band left\r\nalive when I'm done._\r\n\r\nHe would make them suffer. From this moment on, he had only one thing to\r\nthink of and only one thing to do: kill Indians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK 3\r\n\r\n1832\r\n\r\n\r\nMoon of Strawberries\r\n\r\n_June_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n18\r\n\r\nThe Trembling Lands\r\n\r\n\r\nRedbird thought, _Our land by the Rock River was so good to us, and now\r\nsee what we have come to_.\r\n\r\nOnly starving people tried to make food from cattail seeds and the inner\r\nbark of slippery elm and willow trees.\r\n\r\nWith a small steel knife Redbird cut cattails, dropping them into a\r\nbasket she carried over her arm. It would take thousands of the tiny\r\nseeds, painstakingly picked from the white fuzz and then ground into\r\nmeal, to make a little bread that must be shared among five people.\r\n\r\nRedbird moved slowly, pushing her swollen belly before her. As much as\r\nher back and her feet hurt, she was determined to spend every day out\r\nforaging until the baby was born. For the baby's sake she had to eat as\r\nmuch as she could, but she did not want to take that extra portion from\r\nthe rest of her family without contributing as much as she could to the\r\ncommon supply.\r\n\r\nShe sang as she walked along, asking the Trembling Lands to yield fruits\r\nand berries. She found no fruits or berries, but singing kept her\r\nspirits up, and she thought it helped the others too. Yellow Hair smiled\r\nand nodded to her to show that she liked the song.\r\n\r\nSweat trickled down her back and inside her doeskin dress. Gray clouds\r\nlay heavily over the Trembling Lands, and the air was warm and wet. Even\r\nthough the water of the lake was dark and muddy, Redbird was looking\r\nforward to bathing in it.\r\n\r\nAnd she was looking forward to a private talk with Yellow Hair. Yellow\r\nHair had been with them for many days and nights. It was time she went\r\nto bed with White Bear.\r\n\r\nYellow Hair walked beside her around the edge of the lake. Ahead of them\r\nran Eagle Feather with a captive pale eyes boy named Woodrow. Iron Knife\r\nhad brought Woodrow back from a raid, and White Bear had taken him under\r\nhis protection too.\r\n\r\nWoodrow, a few years older than Eagle Feather, was darting this way and\r\nthat, uprooting plants and throwing them down, tasting berries and\r\nspitting them out. Redbird watched him with amusement. She had already\r\ngrown fond of him.\r\n\r\nWoodrow said something to Yellow Hair, who smiled and turned to Redbird.\r\n\r\nSpeaking the pale eyes' tongue slowly, adding the few Sauk words she\r\nknew and using gestures, Yellow Hair managed to explain to Redbird that\r\nWoodrow was unhappy because he did not know what to pick.\r\n\r\n\"If look good, pick,\" Redbird said, using the little English White Bear\r\nhad taught her. \"Not eat. If I say good, then eat.\"\r\n\r\nWoodrow grinned and nodded to Redbird to show he understood. He ran off\r\nafter Eagle Feather, who was looking for birds and squirrels to shoot\r\nwith his small bow and arrow. Woodrow had been a captive only half as\r\nlong as Yellow Hair, but unlike her, he seemed happy with his lot.\r\n\r\nRedbird doubted that Eagle Feather and Woodrow would find any squirrels\r\nor birds. Very little that was edible, plant or animal, lived in this\r\nmarsh, and over a thousand people had been foraging in the area for more\r\nthan a moon. The last time the British Band had eaten well was when Wolf\r\nPaw brought the cattle. And among so many people, those cattle had not\r\nlasted long. Many people were digging in the ground for worms and grubs,\r\nroasting them and eating them in handfuls. Some people were even\r\nsecretly killing and eating horses, though Black Hawk had decreed death\r\nfor anyone caught doing that.\r\n\r\nAs for Redbird herself, she felt an emptiness in her belly from the time\r\nshe woke till the time she went to sleep, and she found herself wanting\r\nto sleep longer and longer as her strength ebbed away. She worried\r\nconstantly that the baby inside her was not getting enough nourishment\r\nand would die or be stunted. The people around her were starting to look\r\nlike walking skeletons.\r\n\r\nThey came to a point of land covered with pale green shrubs thrusting\r\nout into the lake. Redbird called Eagle Feather.\r\n\r\n\"Go for a swim around the other side of this point and take the pale\r\neyes boy with you.\"\r\n\r\nEagle Feather's blue eyes glowed. \"Maybe I can shoot a frog.\"\r\n\r\nOnce the boys were gone, she said to Yellow Hair, \"We take bath.\" Yellow\r\nHair smiled gratefully.\r\n\r\nAs they waded naked into the greenish, murky water, Redbird eyed Yellow\r\nHair's body, so different from a Sauk woman's. She remembered how\r\nhungrily the braves had stared at Yellow Hair when Wolf Paw's wife\r\nstripped her before the tribe.\r\n\r\nYet it was easy to imagine that such pale skin was a sign of sickness.\r\nYellow Hair's face and hands were somewhat tan, but every other part of\r\nher was white as milk. Her ribs were showing, a sign of the hunger they\r\nwere all suffering. Still, her breasts were round, with pretty pink\r\nnipples. Her legs were long, and her buttocks curved out sharply; those\r\nof Sauk women were flatter. Even though the hair under her arms and\r\nbetween her legs was light in color, she had an abundance of it, much\r\nmore than the fine tufts of black hair Redbird had in those places. She\r\nhad undone her braids, and her hair fell like a golden curtain down her\r\nback halfway to her waist.\r\n\r\n_What a beautiful creature she is!_\r\n\r\nWhat an evil, stupid thing it would have been if Running Deer and the\r\nothers had been allowed to cut her to bits and burn her.\r\n\r\nA man might find Yellow Hair's differences from Sauk women attractive. A\r\nman such as White Bear.\r\n\r\nShe felt no fear that the pale eyes woman would take White Bear away\r\nfrom her. He showed many times every day, with his looks, with his\r\nmovements, with his words, that Redbird, and not Yellow Hair, was first\r\nin his heart.\r\n\r\nRedbird waded into the lake until the water was up to her breasts and\r\nher feet were sinking in the ooze. Then she pushed herself forward and\r\ndog-paddled through the reeds. It was wonderful to let the water take\r\nthe weight of her belly off her hips and legs, a welcome relief to feel\r\nso cool.\r\n\r\nIn the night in the wickiup she often heard Yellow Hair moving or\r\nweeping softly. And that meant that Yellow Hair must have heard White\r\nBear and Redbird loving each other in bed. This was only to be expected.\r\nWhen families slept all together in lodges and wickiups, the children\r\nearly came to know how their parents took pleasure together during the\r\nnight, and were unembarrassed when they grew up and their turn came. But\r\nhow did the sounds of White Bear and Redbird together make Yellow Hair\r\nfeel?\r\n\r\nWhite Bear had said that Yellow Hair had wanted him when he lived among\r\nthe pale eyes. And lately Redbird and White Bear had been sleeping apart\r\non their separate pallets more often, because Redbird, in the discomfort\r\nof the final moon of carrying this baby, rarely wanted White Bear inside\r\nher.\r\n\r\nAnd so Redbird had searched her heart and knew that she was willing to\r\nshare her husband with Yellow Hair.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear and Yellow Hair could go to bed with each other.\r\n\r\nAnd should.\r\n\r\nIt would be good for Yellow Hair if her yearning for White Bear could be\r\nsatisfied, at least for a time. The pleasure of mating was a healing\r\nthing. It restored the ill to health, and it made the well strong and\r\nhappy.\r\n\r\nRedbird could see in Yellow Hair's eyes--such a bright blue--how much\r\nshe longed for White Bear. Being close to him, Redbird thought, helped\r\nYellow Hair forget she was a captive.\r\n\r\nSome days ago, not long after White Bear had taken in Woodrow, Redbird\r\nhad told White Bear she would not mind if he took Yellow Hair into his\r\nbed. He had laughed and patted her belly and insisted he could wait\r\nuntil she wanted him again.\r\n\r\nWhy should he _have_ to wait, when a woman who desired him was right\r\nthere in his wickiup?\r\n\r\nIt was good that she had spoken to him, even though he claimed he did\r\nnot want Yellow Hair. At least he knew that if Yellow Hair did come to\r\nhim in the night, they both had Redbird's blessing. But she doubted that\r\nYellow Hair would ever approach White Bear that way. Not without\r\nencouragement.\r\n\r\nShe stopped swimming, and let her feet down into the mud so that she\r\nstood beside Yellow Hair. Here the water of the lake almost came up to\r\nRedbird's shoulders, but Yellow Hair's breasts were well above it. They\r\nsmiled at each other.\r\n\r\nYellow Hair crouched down in the water till it was up to her neck. She\r\ndipped her hair into the water, then lifted her head and squeezed the\r\nwater out of her hair with her hands.\r\n\r\nThe water was good and cool, she said, but she wished she had some soap.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear had explained what soap was, and Redbird smiled and shook\r\nher head. If water would not wash dirt away, a Sauk scrubbed with sand.\r\nAs for hair, Redbird left hers braided. Once at the beginning of summer\r\nand once at the end, she felt, was often enough to let water touch her\r\nunbound hair.\r\n\r\nNow that she had decided to talk to Yellow Hair, Redbird felt a\r\ntightness in her throat. What if the idea of sharing White Bear made\r\nYellow Hair angry? Sharing a mate was not, Redbird knew, according to\r\npale eyes custom.\r\n\r\nThere was only one way: to begin in spite of her fear.\r\n\r\nShe said, \"You know about woman and man? What they do?\" She signed with\r\nher fingers to make her meaning plain, and saw that she had succeeded\r\nwhen the pale eyes woman's face turned a deep red. Redbird wished Yellow\r\nHair were standing up in the water, so she could see whether the rest of\r\nher body turned red too.\r\n\r\nYellow Hair said she knew a little about what men and women did, but her\r\nmother had died a long time ago and her father never spoke of such\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n\"You want me teach?\" Redbird asked.\r\n\r\nYellow Hair turned red again, looked down at the water and nodded.\r\n\r\nSo, as they waded back to the shore of the lake, Redbird tried with many\r\ngestures and a few words to teach Yellow Hair, as Sun Woman many summers\r\nago had taught her. When they were out of the water, Redbird picked up a\r\nstick and drew a little picture on the mudbank. When she was finished,\r\nshe giggled. Yellow Hair took a good look and turned red again, all the\r\nway down to her waist, Redbird noticed. She turned away, but Redbird saw\r\nto her relief that she was laughing. Redbird scratched out the picture.\r\n\r\nThey sat on the bank where they had left their clothing, letting the air\r\ndry their bodies. From a pouch she had brought with her Redbird took a\r\nwood-stoppered gourd containing musk oil. She and Yellow Hair rubbed the\r\noil on their bodies to keep mosquitoes off.\r\n\r\nYellow Hair wanted to know if the first time with a man hurt very much.\r\n\r\n\"Some women hurt much. Other women little.\"\r\n\r\nShe patted Yellow Hair's wrist to reassure her. \"I think you hurt\r\nlittle. After that, feel very, very good.\" She patted herself between\r\nher legs to make plain what she was talking about, and Yellow Hair\r\nblushed again.\r\n\r\n\"_Best_ feeling,\" Redbird added, smiling. It was surprising, Redbird\r\nthought, that Yellow Hair could become a fully grown woman and yet still\r\nhave her first time with a man to look forward to.\r\n\r\nThey sat in silence for a time, Redbird afraid again because now she had\r\nto take the next step.\r\n\r\nBut before she could speak, tears began to trickle down Yellow Hair's\r\ncheeks. She spoke brokenly, and it was hard for Redbird to follow her.\r\nShe seemed to be saying that she expected to die before she ever knew\r\nthose good feelings Redbird talked about with a man she loved. She had\r\nalready lived for twenty summers, and now it seemed she might not live\r\nmuch longer. And never have a man.\r\n\r\nIt was true. There was big danger to Yellow Hair. If anything happened\r\nto White Bear, she would have no protector. Many Sauk hated pale eyes.\r\nOne might get at her. Or her own people might even kill her by mistake.\r\n\r\nYellow Hair had missed so much. So tall and beautiful, but she had\r\nnothing to show for her life--no man, no children. Redbird felt sorry\r\nfor her.\r\n\r\n\"You love White Bear?\" she asked, hugging herself as she said the word\r\n\"love\" to show what she meant.\r\n\r\nNow Yellow Hair turned pale--even paler than usual--and drew away from\r\nRedbird. She shook her head violently, her bright golden hair swinging\r\nall wild and loose, and said, \"No, no, no!\"\r\n\r\nBut she stared at Redbird too fixedly, and Redbird could see that she\r\ndid not mean what she said.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear wanted Yellow Hair, but said he did not want her. Yellow Hair\r\nloved White Bear, but said she did not love him.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear and Yellow Hair were both being foolish. It came of Yellow\r\nHair being pale eyes and White Bear being part pale eyes.\r\n\r\nAnd so now Redbird took a deep breath and said, \"When we sleep tonight,\r\nyou go to bed of White Bear. He make you happy.\"\r\n\r\nYellow Hair's eyes grew huge and her face glowed with a joyous wonder.\r\nShe stammered and gasped as she asked Redbird if she really meant it, if\r\nshe would really let such a thing happen.\r\n\r\n\"I happy when you happy, White Bear happy,\" Redbird said.\r\n\r\nRedbird had come to see Yellow Hair as a younger sister who needed her\r\nhelp and guidance. She liked Yellow Hair much more, in fact, than she\r\nliked either Wild Grape or Robin's Nest. Her sisters had always sneered\r\nat White Bear, and Yellow Hair saw what a fine man he was.\r\n\r\nYellow Hair suddenly looked frightened. She stood up abruptly, picked up\r\nher fringed doeskin dress and struggled into it. When her head appeared\r\nthrough the neck of the dress and she shook her hair free, she was\r\ncrying again.\r\n\r\nNo, she insisted, she couldn't do that. It would be wrong.\r\n\r\nRedbird thought she understood. This hungry, dangerous time was a\r\nterrible time for a woman to be carrying a baby.\r\n\r\n\"You not want baby? Sun Woman makes tea keeps woman from getting baby.\"\r\n\r\nYellow Hair talked for a long time. Redbird tried hard to follow what\r\nshe said, asking questions and making her repeat herself. It had to do\r\nwith Jesus, the pale eyes spirit Père Isaac always talked about. Jesus\r\nwould not like it if Yellow Hair went to bed with White Bear.\r\n\r\nRedbird remembered White Bear telling her that Yellow Hair was the\r\ndaughter of a pale eyes shaman. The Jesus spirit might be a special\r\nspirit for her, then.\r\n\r\n_But I am also the daughter of a shaman. I can teach her what we\r\nbelieve._\r\n\r\n\"Jesus not here,\" Redbird pointed out. \"We children of Earthmaker.\"\r\n\r\nBut also, Yellow Hair explained, by pale eyes custom a woman who slept\r\nwith another woman's husband was a bad woman.\r\n\r\n\"White Bear _is_ your husband,\" Redbird said. \"My father shaman. He\r\nmarry you and White Bear.\" Surely that was more important than what a\r\nlot of pale eyes who were not even here to see might think. Among the\r\nSauk, many would call Yellow Hair a bad woman for _not_ sleeping with\r\nWhite Bear.\r\n\r\n\"We Sauk people. What you do with my Sauk man is good.\"\r\n\r\nYellow Hair sighed and wiped her tears with her fingers. Maybe she would\r\ngo to White Bear in the night, and maybe not. She spread her hands\r\nhelplessly. She did not know what to do.\r\n\r\nRedbird saw that she could tell Yellow Hair no more. The pale eyes would\r\nhave to make up her own mind.\r\n\r\nYellow Hair gave Redbird a sad smile and thanked her for her kindness.\r\nAnd after Redbird had put on her dress and her moccasins, Yellow Hair\r\ngave her a little kiss on the cheek.\r\n\r\nWith a wooden comb Redbird had given her, Yellow Hair combed out her\r\nlong blond locks and began to braid them again.\r\n\r\nThey rejoined Eagle Feather and Woodrow and spent the rest of the\r\nafternoon searching for food, returning to camp when the clouds overhead\r\nturned purple and the sun made a brief appearance, blazing like a\r\nprairie fire on the flat horizon of the marshland.\r\n\r\nRedbird bit her lip anxiously as they walked back to the camp. If Yellow\r\nHair decided not to go to bed with White Bear, she might think,\r\naccording to her pale eyes custom, that Redbird was a bad woman for\r\nsaying she should. But what if Yellow Hair went to bed with White Bear\r\nand he came to love Yellow Hair more than he did Redbird? She had\r\nthought that could not happen, but now that she had spoken out, she was\r\nnot so sure.\r\n\r\nThat night Redbird curled up on her solitary pallet of blankets laid\r\nover a mat of reeds on one side of the wickiup. Yellow Hair lay in her\r\nsleeping place, and the boys were in the one they shared. White Bear was\r\nstill visiting and treating ill people. Many people, especially the very\r\nold and the very young, were falling ill in the Trembling Lands. There\r\nhad been many deaths since they crossed the Great River. Bit by bit the\r\nband was losing the wisdom of the old and the promise of the young.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear came in long after the two women and the boys had settled\r\ndown for the night. He went to his own pallet on the east side of the\r\nwickiup.\r\n\r\nNow that Redbird was ready for sleep, the baby within her woke up, and\r\nits kicking, along with burning feelings that rose from her stomach to\r\nher throat, kept her awake.\r\n\r\nThe stillness was disturbed only by the chirping of countless frogs.\r\n\r\n_Where were those frogs today when we were looking for food? We must ask\r\nthe Frog spirit to let us catch some of them._\r\n\r\nThen she heard another movement. Someone was crawling across the\r\nreed-covered floor of the wickiup. She caught her breath. Yellow Hair's\r\nsleeping place was on the side opposite White Bear's, and the movement\r\nwas unmistakably from her bed to his.\r\n\r\nA little later she heard other sounds that were also easy to\r\nrecognize--the crackling of a bed's reed matting, whispers, little gasps\r\nand groans, loud, fast breathing.\r\n\r\nYellow Hair's cry of pain sounded as if it had come through clenched\r\nteeth. She still did not want anyone to know. Redbird smiled to herself.\r\n\r\nAs she listened to White Bear's heavy panting, Redbird remembered the\r\nsharp pain inside her when she first received him on the island near\r\nSaukenuk.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear sighed loudly, and then everything was still for a time, and\r\nRedbird heard the frogs once more. They were probably mating too. How\r\nwise of Earthmaker to make his creatures into woman and man, so they\r\ncould give each other such wonderful pleasure. Earthmaker knew\r\neverything, but it was hard to see how he could have invented man and\r\nwoman without having seen something that gave him the idea.\r\n\r\nHim? Redbird had always pictured Earthmaker as a man, a giant warrior,\r\nbut now she wondered whether the spirit that gave life to the world and\r\nall things in it might be a she. Or, better yet, maybe there were two\r\nEarthmakers, a he and a she.\r\n\r\nAs she had so many times before, she wished now that the tribe's custom\r\nwould permit her to become a shaman, so that she might see into these\r\nmysteries with her own eyes, as White Bear and Owl Carver had.\r\n\r\nThe sounds started up again from White Bear's bed, the movements, the\r\nwhisperings. Redbird thought about how good it was to have her man\r\nfilling her solidly, giving her delicious feelings as he moved in and\r\nout. And she felt herself warm with desire.\r\n\r\nShe smiled ruefully in the dark.\r\n\r\n_Now I want him and I cannot have him, because I sent Yellow Hair to his\r\nbed._\r\n\r\n_I hope this baby will be born soon, so I can lie with White Bear again.\r\nOf course, even then I will still let Yellow Hair have him, sometimes._\r\n\r\nWhen Redbird awoke at sunrise and got up to begin the day's foraging,\r\nYellow Hair was back sleeping in her own place. In the faint light that\r\nfiltered through the wickiup's elm-bark skin, her pink mouth looked soft\r\nand childlike.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear was seated cross-legged on his bed, loading the rifle he had\r\nbrought with him when he came back to the tribe. With food so short,\r\neven the shaman had to go out and try to hunt to supply his family; the\r\npeople he treated had no gifts to give him. She stood looking at him,\r\nwaiting for him to speak to her, but he kept his eyes on his rifle with\r\nfoolish shyness.\r\n\r\nDid he think she was angry at him, or that she was going to tease him,\r\nthe way Water Flows Fast might?\r\n\r\nPoor Water Flows Fast--she made few jokes since her husband, Three\r\nHorses, was killed at Old Man's Creek.\r\n\r\nRedbird said, \"I know what happened last night. I am glad that it\r\nhappened. It was good for her and for you.\"\r\n\r\nNow White Bear's dark eyes met hers, troubled. \"Yes, it is good for me\r\nand Nancy--Yellow Hair--but only for now.\"\r\n\r\n\"What troubles you?\" she asked him.\r\n\r\n\"One day, when Yellow Hair must leave us and go back to her own people,\r\nI think she will be very sad. That is why I did not lie with her when\r\nshe wanted me to at Victor. I knew we would have to part.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now she has what she wants, at least for as long as she stays with us.\r\nNow she will have something to think about besides how afraid she is.\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled at her. \"And you made it happen. I know that you sent her to\r\nme. You are a great troublemaker.\"\r\n\r\nHe stood up and stroked her cheek with his fingertips, and she felt a\r\nglow inside, certain now that speaking to Yellow Hair had been right.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe afternoon sun heated the interior of the birthing wickiup till it\r\nfelt like a sweat lodge.\r\n\r\nRedbird screamed. It was not a baby; it was a wild horse down there,\r\nkicking its way out. She felt about to faint.\r\n\r\nThe pain died away. Groaning, Redbird went limp between Wind Bends Grass\r\nand Yellow Hair, who held her arms. Sun Woman crouched before Redbird,\r\nobserving the progress of the birth by the light of a single candle.\r\n\r\nHer skin slick with sweat, Redbird was squatting naked over a pile of\r\nblankets in the center of the wickiup. Her back and legs ached\r\nunbearably.\r\n\r\n\"You don't have to scream so loud,\" Wind Bends Grass said abruptly. \"It\r\ndoesn't hurt that much.\"\r\n\r\nRedbird wished her mother could feel this pain and know how much it\r\nhurt. She felt like telling Wind Bends Grass to leave the birthing\r\nwickiup.\r\n\r\nSun Woman said gently, \"No one knows how much another person hurts.\"\r\n\r\n_I don't remember this much pain when Eagle Feather was born. Maybe I am\r\ngoing to die._\r\n\r\nSun Woman stood up and wiped Redbird's forehead with a cool, wet\r\nkerchief, then cleaned her bottom for her, where a little blood was\r\ndripping.\r\n\r\n\"I can see the top of the baby's head,\" Sun Woman said. \"It will be a\r\ngood birth. You are almost done now.\"\r\n\r\nRedbird looked up at the mare's tail, dyed red, that hung over the\r\nwickiup doorway, medicine to make the birth go easier.\r\n\r\n_Let it be over soon_, she prayed. Her pains had started at dawn, and\r\nnow it was past midday. Sun Woman had used up four candles, and in the\r\nwhole band there were hardly any candles left. It had not taken this\r\nlong with Eagle Feather.\r\n\r\nYellow Hair rubbed the arm she was holding, and Redbird managed to look\r\nat her and smile. Though Redbird had meant to honor Yellow Hair by\r\nasking her to help here, she was not sure now that she had done the\r\nright thing. The pale eyes woman's face was icy white, and she kept\r\nbiting her lips as if trying to keep from being sick. She had probably\r\nnever seen anything like this before.\r\n\r\nWind Bends Grass had insisted that it was bad luck to have Yellow Hair\r\npresent, but Redbird had ignored her.\r\n\r\nThe next pain came, and Redbird, to show her mother how much it hurt,\r\nscreamed even louder and longer than she had to. This time the pain gave\r\nher hardly any rest before it came again. And another came stepping on\r\nits heels. And another.\r\n\r\nHer screams were continuous now, and she was hoarse and coughing and did\r\nnot have to pretend. Her eyes were blind with tears. She dug her nails\r\ninto the arms of Wind Bends Grass and Yellow Hair and bent forward,\r\npushing as hard as she could.\r\n\r\nShe felt the enormous mass breaking out of her, and found her voice\r\nagain in a scream that could split the very sky open even as the baby\r\nwas tearing her in two.\r\n\r\nHer ears rang. She felt broken and useless, like an empty eggshell. She\r\nhurt terribly, but a great weight was gone from inside her.\r\n\r\nWind Bends Grass said, \"You have done well, my daughter.\"\r\n\r\nRedbird started to cry, from pain, from relief, and because she had\r\nfinally pleased her mother.\r\n\r\nFrom the floor she heard a tiny cough, and then a drawn-out wail. She\r\nlooked down and saw the little bright red figure in Sun Woman's arms,\r\nits eyes screwed shut, its mouth wide open, at the joining of its legs\r\nthe life-giving crevice. A glistening blue cord coiling up from the\r\nbaby's belly joined her still to Redbird's body.\r\n\r\nShe felt another pain now, and pushed out the afterbirth with a groan.\r\nWind Bends Grass and Yellow Hair helped her to stumble to the bed\r\nagainst the wall of the wickiup. They wrapped her in a light blanket,\r\nwhile Sun Woman cut the cord and set it aside to be dried and put in the\r\nbaby's medicine bag. Then Wind Bends Grass bathed the tiny body first\r\nwith water, then with oil. She put her granddaughter in her daughter's\r\narms.\r\n\r\n\"What will you call her?\" she asked.\r\n\r\nRedbird had thought of a name in the lake where she and Yellow Hair had\r\nbeen bathing several days ago. \"I will call her Floating Lily.\"\r\n\r\n\"A good name,\" Sun Woman said.\r\n\r\nFloating Lily's voice was strong. Hungry already, and she had only been\r\nin the world a few moments. Redbird pressed the little mouth against her\r\nbreast. She prayed that she would have milk. She had eaten as much as\r\nshe could; now she must give nourishment.\r\n\r\nShe felt the rhythmic pull on her breast. The baby's mouth was full of\r\nmilk; no more crying. A warm feeling spread through Redbird's body.\r\n\r\nAfter Redbird had fed Floating Lily, they both slept. It was near\r\nsundown when the three women attending her helped her limp with the baby\r\nback to her own wickiup. Each time she took a step it felt as if a club\r\nhit her between her legs, but her heart rejoiced that the ordeal was\r\nover.\r\n\r\nYellow Hair said that she would go and look for Woodrow and Eagle\r\nFeather. She was crying. Redbird was not sure why.\r\n\r\nIn the wickiup, White Bear was waiting for her. As she lay on her bed\r\nwith Floating Lily, his eyes lit up with joy at the sight of his\r\ndaughter. He picked the baby up, which made her cry, and he laughed and\r\nhanded her back to Redbird.\r\n\r\n\"I was not with you to see our son born,\" he said. \"I have never been\r\nhappier in my life than I am at this moment.\"\r\n\r\nThe hide curtain over the wickiup doorway was pulled aside and Owl\r\nCarver entered, holding his owl's head medicine stick in one hand and a\r\nbowl of smoking aromatic herbs and wood shavings in another. His white\r\nhair was getting thinner and thinner, Redbird noticed, and he walked\r\nwith a permanent stoop. He blew the smoke over Redbird and Floating Lily\r\nto bless them.\r\n\r\n\"May she walk her path with honor,\" he said, laying his hand on Floating\r\nLily's head. He left, the scented smoke lingering behind him.\r\n\r\nWhen Redbird bared her breast, White Bear leaned over and kissed her\r\nnipple, his lips catching a droplet of milk that had formed there. She\r\nput Floating Lily to her breast and lay in contented silence with her\r\nhusband sitting beside her.\r\n\r\nHe took up his book and read aloud:\r\n\r\n    \"Whence Hail to thee,\r\n    Eve, rightly called Mother of all Mankind,\r\n    Mother of all things living, since by thee\r\n    Man is to live, and all things live for Man.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does that mean?\" she asked.\r\n\r\nHe translated the words into Sauk, and said, \"It means that all life\r\ncomes from woman.\"\r\n\r\nIron Knife's head suddenly appeared in the doorway, his eyes wide, his\r\nmouth drawn down.\r\n\r\n\"White Bear! Long knives coming this way, thousands of them.\"\r\n\r\nRedbird's body went cold, and she clutched the baby to her. How could\r\nshe keep this tender new life safe in the midst of flight and fighting?\r\n\r\n\"Maybe they will not be able to find us,\" White Bear said.\r\n\r\n\"No, the scouts say they have Potawatomi guides riding with them, who\r\nknow where to look for us. Potawatomi dogs! To side with the long knives\r\nagainst us.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Potawatomi must have been forced to help,\" said White Bear quietly.\r\n\r\nIron Knife said, \"Black Hawk says we must break camp right now. We will\r\nhead west as quickly as we can toward the Great River.\"\r\n\r\nRedbird tightened her arms around Floating Lily until the baby cried out\r\nin pain. Instantly she relaxed her grip, but in her mind she saw the\r\nlong knives coming, with their cruel, hairy faces, murdering them all\r\nwith their guns and their swords. She saw the people she loved sprawled\r\ndead in the mud of the Trembling Lands. White Bear had told her that\r\nBlack Hawk's war parties had killed many pale eyes, even women and\r\nchildren. Now the long knives would take terrible vengeance. Even as she\r\nstroked the baby and whispered to soothe her, her heart pounded in her\r\nchest.\r\n\r\nThere would be hard traveling ahead and even less food, thought Redbird.\r\nTrying to walk after just giving birth, the pain would kill her.\r\n\r\nFor an instant she hated Black Hawk for having led them into this\r\nsuffering. If only the British Band had listened last winter to White\r\nBear. And to her. Then hatred gave way to sick despair. She would die\r\nbefore they ever reached the Great River. And Floating Lily, who had\r\njust come into the world, would die too.\r\n\r\nIron Knife left them. White Bear turned to Redbird, and she saw in his\r\neyes the same hopelessness she felt. But if he gave up, too, they were\r\ntruly lost. Why, then, go through the agony of a flight from the long\r\nknives? They might as well stay here and let the long knives come and\r\nkill them.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear said, \"The Turtle told me, 'The many who follow Black Hawk\r\nacross the Great River will be few when they cross back.'\" A chill went\r\nthrough her as she saw how those prophetic words were coming true.\r\n\r\nThe little bundle in Redbird's arms stirred. Anger rose in her. Despite\r\nBlack Hawk's blundering, despite the deadly hatred of the long knives,\r\nshe and her husband and her son and her baby daughter would not let\r\nthemselves be killed.\r\n\r\n\"Then if we do not cross the Great River we will escape in some other\r\ndirection,\" she said firmly. \"Go and find Eagle Feather and Woodrow. I\r\nwill start to pack our belongings.\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled gratefully at her, reached for her and held her. She felt\r\nherself gaining strength from his strong arms around her.\r\n\r\n\"For a few days I will not be able to walk or ride. You will have to tie\r\nme to a travois and pull me along, as we do with old people.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I have to carry you in my arms,\" said White Bear, \"I will do that.\"\r\n\r\nNow that she was determined to fight to stay alive, she smiled up at\r\nWhite Bear and pressed herself against him. She _was_ love. The power of\r\na great spirit, perhaps that she-Earthmaker she had once thought of,\r\nfilled her.\r\n\r\nThe Turtle, she thought, had said that many would die. But he had also\r\nsaid that a few would live.\r\n\r\nShe and her husband and her children, they would live.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n19\r\n\r\nThe Band Divided\r\n\r\n\r\nThe setting sun, warming the flat land at the foot of a hill beside the\r\nGreat River, cast deep shadows in the hollows of Redbird's and Nancy's\r\nfaces. How thin they were getting to be. Fear for them wriggled\r\nsnakelike through White Bear's own empty stomach.\r\n\r\n_Has Earthmaker abandoned his people? No--worse--this is the fate he has\r\nchosen for us. He bestows evil as well as good on his children._\r\n\r\nRedbird said wearily, \"What did the council decide?\" She unfastened the\r\nsling in which she carried Floating Lily on her back and cradled the\r\nbaby in her arms, frowning into the tiny brown face. White Bear knew\r\nwhat she was thinking. Floating Lily was too quiet.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear said, \"Black Hawk wants to go north and seek refuge with the\r\nChippewa. He took the compass my father gave him out of his medicine bag\r\nand showed it to the chiefs and braves. He said we must follow its arrow\r\nnorth. But Iron Knife disagreed with him.\"\r\n\r\nRedbird's eyes widened. \"My brother never disagrees with Black Hawk.\r\nBlack Hawk has lived three times as long as he has.\"\r\n\r\n\"Iron Knife spoke for many of the younger braves,\" White Bear said.\r\n\"They want to cross the Great River here, now, and bring the war to an\r\nend. Black Hawk reminded them that we have only three canoes. Each canoe\r\ncan hold only six people, and two of those six must paddle back and\r\nforth. They would have to ferry nearly a thousand people. He said the\r\nlong knives would reach us long before we all got across. Iron Knife\r\nsaid they would make rafts and more canoes. In the end the three chiefs\r\nand most of the braves said they would cross the river. Only a few have\r\nagreed to go north with Black Hawk.\"\r\n\r\nIt had taken a whole moon to cross from east to west, from their camp in\r\nthe Trembling Lands to this place where the Bad Axe River emptied into\r\nthe Great River. The land through which they passed, following an old\r\nWinnebago trail, was rolling prairie at first. Then they plunged into\r\ncountry that was ever wilder and more mountainous as they struggled\r\nwestward. At the last they had to cut their own trail. They marked their\r\npassage with kettles, blankets, tent poles and other possessions too\r\nheavy to carry--and their dying old people who could walk no more, and\r\ntheir dead children. The only good thing about this rugged land was that\r\nit slowed down the long knives even more than it did Black Hawk's\r\npeople, who knew by the time they reached the Great River that their\r\npursuers were two days behind them.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear told Nancy in English what he had just told Redbird about the\r\ncouncil.\r\n\r\n\"If the band is dividing, where will _we_ go?\" Nancy asked.\r\n\r\n\"I asked Black Hawk--I begged him--to let you and Woodrow go.\" Anger\r\ncrept into White Bear's voice as he recalled Black Hawk's stubbornness.\r\n\"He still refuses. He wants to take the two of you north with him.\"\r\n\r\nRedbird said, \"But pale eyes prisoners are no good to Black Hawk now.\"\r\nWhite Bear was pleased to see that she had learned to get the drift of\r\nEnglish conversations between him and Nancy. He did not like to feel\r\nthat he was leaving Redbird out of anything, especially since he _knew_\r\nNancy now.\r\n\r\n\"True,\" White Bear said to Redbird in Sauk. \"And if we meet up with long\r\nknives again they will shoot first and not think to look for pale eyes\r\namong us. I want to get Yellow Hair and Woodrow away from the tribe\r\nbefore there is another battle.\"\r\n\r\nThere had been one great battle with the long knives halfway through\r\ntheir trek, on the south shore of the Ouisconsin River. Many had died on\r\nboth sides, but Black Hawk had managed to get most of his people away\r\nafter nightfall. Right now White Bear could almost hear the huge army of\r\nlong knives crashing through the forests behind them.\r\n\r\nBut Nancy shook her head violently. \"I feel safer with you.\" Her eyes\r\nglistened with tears.\r\n\r\nEver since Redbird had encouraged Nancy to seek his bed, White Bear had\r\nfeared that when the time came for their parting, it would hurt her\r\nbadly.\r\n\r\nAnd him as well. In the moon just past he and Nancy had joined bodies\r\nand hearts many times. Now it seared his throat to speak aloud his\r\ndecision that Nancy must leave the British Band.\r\n\r\nHe sat down on a fallen tree trunk and reached out to her. Nancy came\r\nover and took his hands and sat beside him.\r\n\r\n\"With the band going in two different directions, this is your best\r\nchance to get away. You and I have loved each other, but you are still a\r\nwhite woman, and my people murdered your father. Why should you share\r\nour fate? And what about Woodrow? If you and he go together, you have a\r\nbetter chance of reaching safety.\"\r\n\r\nShe bent over, her shoulders shaking with sobs. \"If you're going to die,\r\nI want to die with you.\"\r\n\r\nA moon ago, he thought, she had desperately wanted to escape from the\r\nBritish Band. Now her own heart was holding her captive.\r\n\r\nEve's words to Adam as they left Paradise rose unbidden in his mind:\r\n_With thee to go, is to stay here; without thee here to stay, is to go\r\nhence unwilling._\r\n\r\n\"But no one wants to die,\" he said gently. \"For you to stay now when you\r\ncan escape would be madness.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a madness he felt himself. There was a part of him that wanted to\r\nkeep her with him, to let her stay, however all this might end. He had\r\nto force himself to keep to his plan to help her get away.\r\n\r\nEagle Feather and Woodrow came from the woods along the south bank of\r\nthe Bad Axe River, arms loaded with boughs for the wickiup that now they\r\nwould not bother to build.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear squatted down before Woodrow and grasped his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"Tonight I am going to help you and Miss Nancy to get away from our band\r\nand back to the white people.\" He would be sorry to lose the boy.\r\n\r\nEagle Feather, standing nearby, said nothing. But his face, full of woe,\r\ntold White Bear that he understood.\r\n\r\n\"I guess Miss Nancy and me could find our way to white folks if we\r\nfollow the river,\" Woodrow said uncertainly. With the beaded headband\r\nIron Knife had given him wrapped around his high forehead, and his face\r\nbrowned by the summer sun, he looked like a Sauk boy, except for his\r\nlight brown hair. He seemed not much happier about leaving the band than\r\nNancy.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not going to send you to find your way alone,\" White Bear said.\r\n\"I'll go with you until I see you in safe hands. Prairie du Chien and\r\nFort Crawford are south of here on the river. If we go in that direction\r\nwe're bound to meet some of your people.\"\r\n\r\n\"I got no people but you,\" said Woodrow. \"You treated me better than my\r\nfolks ever did.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear felt a catch in his throat. He remembered how, seven years\r\nago, he had fought against being sent from the tribe when Star Arrow\r\ncame looking for him.\r\n\r\nEagle Feather's blue eyes rested gravely on White Bear. \"What about\r\nMother and Floating Lily and me? Are we going to cross the Great River\r\nnow?\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear remembered again what the Turtle had said in his vision. He\r\nlooked out at the river, tinged with red by the sunset, and felt a\r\nchill. Calamity, his shaman's sense told him, awaited those who tried to\r\nescape by crossing the river again.\r\n\r\n\"No.\" White Bear looked over at Redbird, who held Floating Lily to her\r\nbreast. \"Day after tomorrow at the latest, the long knives will be here.\r\nI want you to go with Black Hawk. Though I think Black Hawk has led us\r\nunwisely, still, to go north is safer. Three lodges, about fifty people,\r\nare going with Black Hawk. Owl Carver, Flying Cloud, Wolf Paw--they will\r\nfollow him.\"\r\n\r\nHe shook his head sadly.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" Redbird asked.\r\n\r\n\"Even Wolf Paw disagrees with Black Hawk about going north. He himself\r\nwill remain at his father's side, but he is sending his two wives and\r\nhis children across the river. He thinks they will be safer. I think he\r\nis wrong.\"\r\n\r\nHe gazed out at the reddened river and shook his head again.\r\n\r\n\"Wolf Paw made the right choice for his family,\" said a deep voice\r\nbehind him. White Bear turned to see Iron Knife's huge figure,\r\nsilhouetted by the setting sun. Behind him trudged a much smaller shadow\r\nwhom White Bear recognized at once--Sun Woman.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear hurried to his mother, put his arm around her shoulders and\r\nled her to the fallen tree to sit down. He could feel her bones under\r\nher doeskin dress.\r\n\r\n\"How is my mother?\"\r\n\r\nShe patted his hand. \"Very tired. But alive.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you hungry?\"\r\n\r\n\"One good thing about getting old is that I do not want as much food.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear felt immediate relief that they did not have to share their\r\nfew boiled roots and their bits of meal cake, and then he hated himself\r\nfor begrudging food to his own mother.\r\n\r\n_Getting old_, she had said. She was not an old woman. From what she had\r\ntold him, he guessed her age was less than fifty summers. But the woman\r\nbefore him was terribly gaunt and stooped. The privations of the moons\r\njust past had aged her beyond her years.\r\n\r\nHe felt a stone block his throat as he realized that his mother might\r\nnot have much longer to live.\r\n\r\nIron Knife bent down and hugged Redbird, then patted Woodrow's head with\r\na big hand while the boy looked up at him with shining eyes. It was Iron\r\nKnife, leading the war party that had captured Woodrow, who had insisted\r\nthe boy be allowed to live.\r\n\r\nLike everyone else in the band, Iron Knife was mostly brown skin\r\nstretched over a skeleton, but his was a very big skeleton, a head\r\ntaller than White Bear's. Studying Iron Knife, White Bear wondered\r\nwhether he could ask his help in getting Woodrow and Nancy safely away.\r\n\r\nIron Knife said, \"There is no safety in following Black Hawk. He said\r\nthe British and the Potawatomi and Winnebago would join forces with us,\r\nand they did not. Now he says the Chippewa will help us. He is sure to\r\nbe wrong again. And before he gets to the Chippewa he must travel\r\nthrough Winnebago country for many days, and now most of the Winnebago\r\nare helping the long knives hunt us.\"\r\n\r\nSun Woman said, \"Black Hawk knows that if we join the rest of the tribe\r\nin Ioway, he will no longer be leader. No doubt those who accepted He\r\nWho Moves Alertly as their chief have prospered as much as we have\r\nsuffered. Black Hawk will have to take second place to He Who Moves\r\nAlertly. That sticks in his throat like a fishbone. He would rather lead\r\nus on and on until we all die.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear had to force his voice from a chest tight with urgency. \"You\r\nwill not have time to build enough canoes and rafts before the long\r\nknives are upon you.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the heads of the long knives would be full of names like Kellogg's\r\nGrove, Old Man's Creek, Apple River Fort, Indian Creek and Victor, and\r\ntheir hearts would be ravenous for revenge.\r\n\r\nIron Knife sat down on the tree trunk beside Sun Woman and pointed at\r\nthe river. \"If they attack us before we can cross, we can defend\r\nourselves on that island.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear followed Iron Knife's gesture. The sun had just set behind\r\nthe western hills, and the Great River now reflected a pale blue back at\r\nthe sky. A long, low island covered with spruce and hemlock trees bulked\r\ndarkly an arrow's flight from shore. White Bear shivered. His shaman's\r\nsenses told him that this was a place of grief and horror, an isle of\r\ndeath. He did not like the name of this river at whose mouth they were\r\ncamped--the Bad Axe.\r\n\r\nTrying to ignore the rapid thudding of his heart, White Bear readied\r\nhimself to talk to Iron Knife about Woodrow and Nancy. He hated having\r\nto reveal his plan. If Iron Knife was against letting the two pale eyes\r\nescape, all would be lost. He opened his mouth, hesitating.\r\n\r\nBut he needed Iron Knife's help getting horses and avoiding the warriors\r\nguarding the camp. He reminded himself that Redbird's brother had always\r\ngiven him help when he needed it. He decided to go ahead and talk to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHe said, \"It would not be good for Yellow Hair and the boy to cross the\r\nriver or to go with Black Hawk. I have taken them into my care, and now\r\nI am afraid for them. If there is a battle, the long knives may kill\r\nthem by mistake.\"\r\n\r\nIron Knife grunted. \"I would be sorry to see that happen.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear's heartbeat steadied. He felt more sure of himself now.\r\n\r\nHe took a deep breath and said, \"I have been thinking of helping them to\r\nget away.\"\r\n\r\nIron Knife smiled at White Bear, reached across Sun Woman and patted his\r\nknee. \"That is well.\"\r\n\r\n\"It honors you, my son,\" said Sun Woman.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear felt knots released in his chest and shoulders. \"I was hoping\r\nyou would see this as I see it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will offer to watch the horses tonight,\" Iron Knife said. \"Come when\r\nyou are ready, and I will have three picked for you.\"\r\n\r\nSun Woman said, \"If the long knives see you with Yellow Hair and the\r\nboy, they will try to shoot you.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear put an arm around her bony shoulders and pulled her to him.\r\n\"There is danger all around us, Mother. I think those who follow Black\r\nHawk to the north will be safest. Redbird and the children will go that\r\nway. I think you should too. Do not try to cross the Great River.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have walked enough,\" said Sun Woman. \"My legs ache and my feet are\r\nbruised. If I follow Black Hawk, I will end like the old people who sit\r\ndown by the trail and wait for death.\"\r\n\r\n\"I speak as a shaman,\" White Bear said. \"I have a bad feeling about this\r\nriver crossing.\"\r\n\r\nSun Woman stood up. \"And I speak as a medicine woman. I have seen many\r\nkinds of death, and I would rather drown or be shot than die little by\r\nlittle of hunger and weariness.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear hugged his mother again. \"I know we will meet again in the\r\nWest,\" he said. That, as they both knew, could mean across the river or\r\nat the other end of the Trail of Souls.\r\n\r\nSun Woman said, \"My son, you have made my heart glad. Every day of your\r\nlife you have walked your path with courage and honor. May you walk the\r\nsame way always.\"\r\n\r\nRedbird held Sun Woman and Iron Knife, each in turn, for a long time.\r\nAnd after they had gone, White Bear and Redbird went together into the\r\nthick woods along the edge of the Great River.\r\n\r\nAway from the others, White Bear became aware of the shrill chirping of\r\nchoirs of crickets filling the night air. Mosquitoes shrilled around his\r\nears and stung his hands and face. He and Redbird had long since used up\r\nthe oil that kept them off. But the scratches and bruises of the trail\r\nof hardship they had walked these past moons had toughened their skins\r\nand their spirits so that mosquito stings meant little.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear found a clear spot in the midst of a stand of young maples,\r\nand they lay down side by side. He put his hand on her breast, fuller\r\nthan he had ever felt it, swollen with milk for Floating Lily. She\r\nslipped her dress down off her shoulders and let him touch her bare\r\nflesh. Very gently, knowing it was tender from nursing, he caressed her\r\nnipple with his fingertips.\r\n\r\n\"Before I leave tonight I will give you the deerhorn-handled dagger my\r\nfather gave me,\" he said softly. \"I must go unarmed, so that the long\r\nknives will not kill me if they catch me. Keep it for me till I come\r\nback.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid,\" she whispered. \"When you and Yellow Hair and Woodrow are\r\ngone, Black Hawk will know you helped them escape. What will he do to\r\nyou when you come back?\"\r\n\r\n\"By the time I return to you, he will not be angry. He will realize he\r\ndid not really need them.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then, too, White Bear might be captured or killed. The last time he\r\nhad gone to the long knives they had nearly killed him. The sight of\r\nLittle Crow's head bursting, blood flying everywhere as Armand\r\nPerrault's bullet smashed it, would never leave his memory.\r\n\r\nIf that happened to him, Black Hawk's anger would not matter.\r\n\r\nRedbird wriggled closer to him, her hand stroking his chest as his\r\nstroked hers. \"I do not think any Sauk warrior would be willing to steal\r\nprisoners away from his chief. I think you do this because you have\r\nlived so long with pale eyes.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear felt desire for her swelling in him. They had coupled twice\r\nonly since Floating Lily was born. He pulled her skirt up so he could\r\nstroke her belly and the smooth insides of her thighs.\r\n\r\n\"From what I saw among the pale eyes,\" he said, knowing a bitterness\r\neven as he sought the joy of Redbird, \"they are more obedient to their\r\nchiefs than we are. And though it makes our hearts weep, if our people\r\nare not to disappear, we must learn to obey our leaders as the pale eyes\r\ndo. But this night I must disobey our war chief.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must change,\" said Redbird. \"But if we become like the pale eyes it\r\nwill be the same as disappearing.\" Then she whispered, \"Oh!\" as his\r\ntouch in a warm, moist place pleased her.\r\n\r\nShe loosened his loincloth, and his breathing quickened as her\r\nfingertips played awhile with him; then she grasped his hard flesh\r\nfirmly. He sighed as he felt her fingers squeezing him. He should save\r\nhis strength, he thought, because he would be awake and traveling all\r\nnight, and probably all day tomorrow, with Nancy and Woodrow. But he and\r\nRedbird might never be together like this again. He rolled over on top\r\nof her and let her small, gentle hand guide him into her as he groaned\r\naloud with the pleasure of it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA tiny sliver of a new moon had risen just above the hills on this side\r\nof the river. White Bear, Nancy and Woodrow made their way south of the\r\nband's camp to a meadow in a hollow between hills.\r\n\r\nHere the band had turned out their few remaining horses to graze and\r\nsleep. From the north end of the camp, beside the Bad Axe River, came\r\nthe sound of men's voices and the light of fires. Men were stripping the\r\nbark from elm trees to make simple canoes and tying driftwood logs\r\ntogether to make rafts.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear, Nancy and Woodrow worked their way around the edge of the\r\nmeadow. The horses were dark shapes standing quietly. White Bear could\r\nhear Nancy stifle a sob every now and then. She had been crying all\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nHe wanted to take her in his arms and hold her close and tell her she\r\ndid not have to leave him. He was the cause of her pain and could do\r\nnothing about it. He could, possibly, save her life, but he could not\r\nmake her happy.\r\n\r\nA tall shadow suddenly stood in his path.\r\n\r\n\"I have three horses ready for you,\" said Iron Knife. \"I even found\r\nsaddles, to make it easier for you to ride. They belonged to men who\r\ndied at the Ouisconsin River battle.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear had been carrying the rifle and powder horn Frank had given\r\nhim. He thrust them at Iron Knife.\r\n\r\n\"I want you to have this rifle. A pale eyes uncle of mine--a good\r\nuncle--gave it to me. If I meet the long knives now, a rifle will not\r\nhelp me.\"\r\n\r\nIron Knife took the rifle and slung the horn over his shoulder. \"May the\r\nspirit of the Great River watch over you.\"\r\n\r\nHis heart aching, White Bear opened his mouth, wanting to tell Iron\r\nKnife again to go with Black Hawk, not to stay here at the mouth of the\r\nBad Axe. But he knew Iron Knife's mind was made up. Redbird's brother\r\nwas strong, not only in body, but in doing what he had decided.\r\n\r\nInstead of speaking, White Bear reached up and grasped Iron Knife's\r\nbroad shoulders and squeezed hard.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhite Bear, Nancy and Woodrow led their horses quietly along the\r\nriverbank, finding places where the shrubbery was thin enough to allow\r\npassage. White Bear kept glancing over his shoulder, and when he could\r\nno longer see the band's fires to the north he whispered to Nancy and\r\nWoodrow to mount.\r\n\r\nHe let his horse find its own path beside the rippling water. Many\r\ntimes as they rode southward he caught himself dozing off, fatigued not\r\nonly by exertion and lack of sleep but by hunger. He watched the\r\nthumbnail-shaped moon slide across the sky over the river. As it sank in\r\nthe west he called a halt and told Nancy and Woodrow they could rest\r\ntill sunup.\r\n\r\nThey tied their horses to saplings and crawled in under the boughs of a\r\nbig spruce tree. Woodrow fell asleep at once, but Nancy crept into White\r\nBear's arms.\r\n\r\nBy her movements she told him that she wanted him.\r\n\r\n\"Forgive me,\" he said. \"I am so tired.\" She stroked his cheek\r\nreassuringly. But her face against his was tear-wet.\r\n\r\nShe fell asleep with her head on his chest.\r\n\r\nDaylight and a loud chorus of birdsong woke them. Soon after they\r\nstarted riding, they passed through an empty village of bark-covered\r\nlodges, Winnebago he was sure, beside the river. Winnebago friends of\r\nBlack Hawk had said that the long knives had ordered all Winnebago to\r\ncamp within sight of the forts to show that they were not helping Black\r\nHawk.\r\n\r\nA clear trail led south from the village along the riverbank, and White\r\nBear, Nancy and Woodrow rode along it. By the end of the day they should\r\nbe near the settlement of Prairie du Chien and the long knives' Fort\r\nCrawford.\r\n\r\nWhen the sun was high over the river, White Bear heard a sound that sent\r\nfear rustling down his back--the drawn-out shouts of long knife leaders\r\ncalling orders. The cries came from somewhere to the south.\r\n\r\nWith horror, he saw it at once in his mind: One long knife army coming\r\nfrom the east. Now another marching up from the south. Both heading for\r\nthe mouth of the Bad Axe where the people were trying desperately to get\r\nacross the river.\r\n\r\nA little later he heard the rumble of many hooves.\r\n\r\nHe wanted to turn and gallop back to warn the band. They had no notion\r\nthat this second army, much closer to them, was coming.\r\n\r\nNancy said, \"You'd better leave us here. They'll shoot at you.\"\r\n\r\nFear for himself and for his people tempted him to agree, but he firmly\r\nshook his head.\r\n\r\n\"I must stay with you until I'm sure you're safe. It is a matter only of\r\nminutes.\"\r\n\r\nSoon White Bear glimpsed the Stars and Stripes fluttering among distant\r\ntrees and the noon sun glittering on brass buttons. Federal troops. At a\r\nclear spot on the trail, where Nancy and Woodrow would be visible from a\r\ndistance, he called a halt.\r\n\r\n\"You two stay on the trail. Nancy, pull your braids around to the front\r\nso they can see your blond hair. Woodrow, take that headband off. You\r\nwant to make sure they see that you're white. Just hold your horses\r\nstill, and when you see the first soldiers, raise your hands above your\r\nheads. And call out to them in English.\"\r\n\r\n_Oh, Earthmaker, keep them safe._ This was the best he could do for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nNancy kissed him hard on the mouth.\r\n\r\n\"I love you so much,\" she said, her voice breaking. \"And I know I'll\r\nnever see you again. Go on, get away from here!\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear led his horse back into the woods between the river and the\r\nbluffs. He tied the horse and then crept back through the shrubbery to\r\nwatch Nancy and Woodrow.\r\n\r\nTerrified by the thought that he might see them shot down before his\r\neyes by careless soldiers, he held his breath.\r\n\r\nHe heard hoofbeats approaching at the gallop.\r\n\r\nHe heard Nancy cry, \"Help us, please! We're white people!\"\r\n\r\n_Good._\r\n\r\nTwo men wearing tall, cylindrical black shakoes and blue jackets with\r\nwhite crossbelts rode up to Nancy and Woodrow, who lowered their hands.\r\nAfter a brief conversation, all four rode off down the trail.\r\n\r\nIn a burst of relief, White Bear let his breath out. For a moment he\r\ncould not move, so limp had his fear for Nancy and Woodrow left him. He\r\nwhispered a prayer of thanks to Earthmaker.\r\n\r\nHe crept back to his horse and walked it till he found a deer track the\r\nhorse could follow, then mounted and trotted northward.\r\n\r\nHe was back riding on the trail when an arrow, thrumming, buried its\r\nhead in the dirt just in front of him. It startled him so that he nearly\r\nfell out of the saddle. He reined in his horse.\r\n\r\nMen on horseback emerged from the trees ahead of him. They rode toward\r\nhim silently, five of them. Two pointed rifles at him, the other three\r\nbows and arrows. They were red men, but wore pale eyes' shirts and\r\ntrousers. Their hair was long, bound by brightly colored sashcloth\r\nbands, and they grew it full, not shaving part of their heads as most\r\nSauk men did.\r\n\r\nHe sighed and held his hands out from his sides to show that they were\r\nempty. The Winnebago could have shot him off his horse without warning,\r\nso he supposed they meant to let him live.\r\n\r\nThe man on the right side of the trail, who held a bow with an arrow\r\naimed at White Bear's heart said, in Sauk, \"I am called Wave. We are\r\nlooking for Black Hawk. Where can we find him?\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear decided to make a joke of that. \"Do you want to help him\r\nfight the long knives?\"\r\n\r\nWave laughed, and translated it for his companions, who laughed also. He\r\nwore a brave's red and white feathers dangling from earrings, with two\r\nmore standing upright in his hair.\r\n\r\nHe said, \"The long knives have offered horses and gold to whoever\r\ncaptures Black Hawk. We are not enemies of the Sauk, but we want the\r\nlong knives' friendship.\" The man spoke Sauk fluently and without an\r\naccent.\r\n\r\n\"It is a shame that the Winnebago fight on the side of the long knives,\"\r\nWhite Bear said. \"One day they will take your land from you, as they\r\nhave taken ours from us.\"\r\n\r\nWave shrugged. \"Look what has happened to you, who fought against them.\"\r\n\r\n_Red man betrays red man, and only the whites gain. It is as I told\r\nRedbird. If we want to live in this land, we ourselves must become like\r\nthe whites._\r\n\r\n\"Come,\" said Wave. \"We must take you to the long knives' war chief.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear slumped in despair, realizing that he was no longer a free\r\nman. He looked about him. The trees, the birds, the Great River, they\r\nwere all free, but he was in the power of his enemies. The world was a\r\ndarker place. Black Hawk's war, for him, was over. He wished he could\r\nhave warned his people about the approaching army of long knives. And\r\nalso, his heart ached for the Sauk he was unable to warn of the second\r\nlong knife army. A yearning for Redbird and Eagle Feather and Floating\r\nLily seemed almost to pull his heart from his body. He prayed that they\r\nhad safely left the Bad Axe country by now and headed north with Black\r\nHawk. Probably he would never see them again. Probably the long knives\r\nwould kill him. With a sigh, he turned his horse's head in the direction\r\nWave had pointed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhile his regiment rode by, the long knife war chief, a stocky man with\r\na long face, thick eyebrows and hard blue eyes, stood by the side of the\r\ntrail facing White Bear. He was Colonel Zachary Taylor, he had told\r\nWhite Bear. A burly, red-faced soldier with a sergeant's three chevrons\r\non his forearm stood beside Taylor staring at White Bear with open\r\nhatred.\r\n\r\n\"What are you, a renegade white man?\" Taylor demanded. \"How come you\r\nspeak good English?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am Sauk, Colonel. My name is White Bear. My father was white, and he\r\ntook me to be educated among the whites for several years.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, White Bear, what were you doing on this trail? Chasing the white\r\nwoman and the boy we just picked up?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was I who brought them to you.\"\r\n\r\nTaylor snorted. \"You expect me to believe that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss Hale will tell you it is true.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we already sent her and the boy back to Fort Crawford with an\r\nescort, so that will have to wait. But you do have her name right. Where\r\nare the rest of the Sauk? Trying to cross the Mississippi?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot help you, Colonel. Any more than you would give information to\r\nthe Sauk, if we captured you.\"\r\n\r\nTaylor's sergeant said, \"Sir, let me and a couple of my men take this\r\nhalf-breed for a stroll in the woods. We'll find out what you want to\r\nknow.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Benson, no.\" Taylor brushed the suggestion aside with an irritated\r\nwave of his hand. \"Showing how they can resist torture is a regular game\r\nwith Indians. He'll just sing Indian songs till he dies, and listening\r\nto that would be worse agony for you than anything you could do to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then let's shoot the bastard, sir, and be done with him. The\r\nmilitia don't take no prisoners. Why should we?\"\r\n\r\nTaylor threw back his head, and even though he was shorter than the\r\nsergeant, managed to look down his nose at him. \"We're professional\r\nsoldiers, Sergeant. I trust we know how to conduct ourselves better than\r\nthe state militia. No, we'll just take him along with us. An Indian who\r\nspeaks both Sauk and English could be of use to us, alive. I see you\r\nhave a full head of hair and you wear no feathers, White Bear. That mean\r\nyou haven't killed anybody? Or just that you don't want the fact known?\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't killed anybody.\" White Bear thought of adding that he had\r\nsaved more than one white life. But he couldn't expect them to believe\r\nthat. He would not expose himself to their scorn.\r\n\r\nHe said, \"I am a medicine man, a shaman.\"\r\n\r\nTaylor looked at him gravely. \"Educated as a white man and educated in\r\nthe way of the spirits, too, eh? And with all that learning you couldn't\r\nwarn Black Hawk away from this disaster?\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear shook his head. \"He listened to other voices.\"\r\n\r\nTaylor's eyes narrowed. \"Well, whatever advice you gave him, it's all\r\nover for your chief now. God pity your people.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear said, \"All they want now is to go back across the Mississippi\r\nand live in peace. Those who are left.\"\r\n\r\nTaylor fixed him with an angry stare. \"It's too late for that. Things\r\nhave gone too far. You people are going to have to suffer for what\r\nyou've done.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear felt his limbs go cold as he heard the steel in Taylor's\r\nvoice. This was not a bad man, White Bear sensed, not a man like Raoul.\r\nBut whatever mercy was in him had no doubt long since been washed away\r\nby the blood shed by Black Hawk's war parties.\r\n\r\n_No doubt while he talks about making my people suffer he thinks of\r\nhimself as quite a civilized man._\r\n\r\n\"Revenge, Colonel?\" White Bear said. \"I thought you were professional\r\nsoldiers.\"\r\n\r\nThe sergeant balled his fists. \"Please, sir, let me teach him some\r\nrespect.\"\r\n\r\nTaylor cocked his head, listening to a distant sound, then turned to\r\nlook downriver.\r\n\r\n\"He's got a much more bitter lesson to learn, Sergeant. As do all his\r\npeople.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Bear heard it too. A chugging sound. It had been a while since he\r\nhad heard a noise like that. He followed Taylor's gaze down the river.\r\nAll he could see was a column of gray smoke in the sky to the south. But\r\nhe knew what it was.\r\n\r\nA steamship.\r\n\r\nBecause he could not ride to warn his people, he wanted to cry out in\r\nagony. He saw what would happen--those few frail canoes, the steamship\r\nbearing down on them, two long knife armies marching inexorably toward\r\nthe mouth of the Bad Axe.\r\n\r\n_The many who follow Black Hawk across the Great River will be few when\r\nthey cross back._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n20\r\n\r\nRiver of Blood\r\n\r\n\r\nRaoul uncorked the jug standing on the chart table and held it out to\r\nBill Helmer, captain of the steamship _Victory_. A portly man with\r\nmuttonchop whiskers, his hands firmly gripping the polished oak steering\r\nwheel, Helmer silently shook his head.\r\n\r\nRaoul lifted the jug in a mock toast. \"May we have a merry day of Indian\r\nfighting.\" He took two long swallows, and decided he felt strong and\r\nhappy.\r\n\r\nHelmer shook his head. \"Mr. de Marion, there's nothing merry about\r\nfighting Indians.\"\r\n\r\n\"If that's your opinion, Captain, I'll thank you to keep it to\r\nyourself,\" said Raoul. He wanted a little warmth right now besides what\r\nhe was getting from the jug, and he despised this dour man for not\r\ngiving it to him.\r\n\r\nHelmer shrugged and bent his gaze on the river.\r\n\r\nRaoul knotted his fingers behind his back, and found that the effort\r\nrelieved the tightness in his belly. He went to stand at the pilot house\r\nwindow and stared out at the forested bank where the Bad Axe River\r\nemptied into the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nMilitiamen were wading across the Bad Axe from south to north, holding\r\ntheir rifles, bayonets fixed, over their heads. The Bad Axe was more a\r\ncreek than a river, shallow now in August, winding through a channel\r\nthick with bright green reeds. As the men slogged up the north bank,\r\nthey leveled their rifles and plunged into the trees.\r\n\r\nA blue haze of powder smoke already drifted amidst the pine and spruce\r\nnorth of the Bad Axe mouth. The popping of rifles carried to Raoul\r\nacross the water over the wheeze and clank of the _Victory_'s steam\r\nengine, fueled with oak and split pine.\r\n\r\nRaoul wondered what was happening in those woods. Were the Indians\r\nfighting back, defending their women and children? He hoped the\r\nmilitiamen would go on killing until they'd exterminated the whole band.\r\nAfter four months of chasing the Indians across Illinois and the\r\nMichigan Territory, after all the innocents murdered--_Clarissa_,\r\n_Phil_, _Andy_--surely the militiamen would not be soft.\r\n\r\nHe felt tears starting up, and he quickly took another pull at the jug.\r\nHe wished he could be in at the kill instead of out here in the river.\r\n\r\n_I want their blood on my own hands._\r\n\r\nLieutenant Kingsbury, in command of the gunnery crew assigned to Raoul\r\nfrom Fort Crawford, came up the stairs from the foredeck to the\r\nhurricane deck and entered the pilot house. He mopped his brow as he set\r\nhis cylindrical shako, sporting its red plume and gold crossed-cannons\r\nartillery badge, on the chart table.\r\n\r\n\"Gets damned sticky on the river in August.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul offered his jug. \"Help you forget the heat.\"\r\n\r\nKingsbury grinned, thanked Raoul and took a big drink. His cheeks\r\nreddened, and he dabbed at his thick brown mustache with his fingertips.\r\n\r\n\"I don't hear much shooting on shore,\" he said, handing the jug back to\r\nRaoul, who took a swallow before setting it down.\r\n\r\n\"Just what I was thinking,\" said Raoul. \"Where the hell are all the\r\nredskins? I figure there's about a thousand left. They can't all have\r\ncrossed the Mississippi before we got here unless they had a whole fleet\r\nof canoes.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Victory_ had caught one canoe in midstream when she arrived on the\r\nscene. Raoul's militia sharpshooters had blanketed it with rifle fire,\r\nkilling all six Indians aboard, and the overturned canoe had drifted\r\ndownstream, out of sight.\r\n\r\nRaoul picked up a brass telescope from the chart table and studied the\r\nriverbank, moving the circular field from point to point. He saw plenty\r\nof militiamen, but no sign of Indians.\r\n\r\n\"Look,\" said Kingsbury. \"Militiamen coming back out of the woods.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul swept his telescope back over the riverbank. Men in buckskins were\r\ndragging their rifle butts along the ground, sitting down on the river's\r\nedge and splashing water on their faces, shaking their heads angrily,\r\nraccoon tails on their caps wagging.\r\n\r\nOne man did emerge from the trees with a big grin, holding high three\r\nbloody scalps dangling from hanks of black hair. Another man led two\r\nIndian ponies. So, the Sauk still had a few horses with them.\r\n\r\nKingsbury said, \"Looks like they only met a handful.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul drummed his fingers on the polished oak sill. \"A rear guard. The\r\nrest could have headed north. But I don't think they did. They were\r\naiming to cross the Mississippi.\"\r\n\r\nHis telescope brought closer an island north of the Bad Axe mouth, about\r\nfifty yards out from the Mississippi's east bank, thickly covered with\r\nspruce and hemlock. He saw two bark canoes with stove-in bottoms beached\r\nat the island's southern tip. Between the island and the riverbank the\r\nwater had a pale green look that said it was shallow.\r\n\r\n\"I've got a feeling most of the Indians are hiding out on that island.\"\r\nHis pulse quickened and his breath came fast.\r\n\r\nHis first thought was to land on the island with his men and flush the\r\nIndians out. But there could still be a couple of hundred warriors left\r\nto the band. No, they'd have to use the six-pounder first.\r\n\r\n\"Captain Bill, sail along the west side of that island. I want to get a\r\ncloser look at it.\"\r\n\r\nThe spokes flew under Helmer's hands, and the _Victory_'s side paddles\r\nchurned up the water.\r\n\r\nRaoul, followed by Kingsbury, hurried down the stairs to the foredeck,\r\nwhere his own dozen militiamen, all Smith County boys who had\r\nreenlisted, watched him stride the planks to stand beside the\r\nsix-pounder. It had saved the townspeople at Victor; now, mounted on the\r\n_Victory_'s foredeck, it would finish the Sauk.\r\n\r\nThe late morning sun beat without mercy on the open deck, and sweat\r\ntrickled down from Raoul's armpits. He wanted to throw his jacket off\r\nand wear just a shirt, but the military blue, the gold braid and the\r\nbrass buttons gave him authority that he'd found he needed, not so much\r\nin dealing with his own men as with other officers.\r\n\r\nHodge Hode said, \"We got 'em treed now, Colonel.\"\r\n\r\n\"But stay under cover,\" said Raoul. \"These raccoons will be shooting\r\nback.\" His eyes tried to tear holes in the thick greenery on the island.\r\n\r\nThe Smith County boys crouched down behind the bales of hay lined along\r\nthe railings and cocked their flintlocks.\r\n\r\nRaoul patted the gun's black muzzle affectionately, and the three\r\nartillerists in blue jackets grinned and nodded at him. They had put\r\ntheir shakoes aside and wrapped rags around their heads to keep the\r\nsweat out of their eyes. Beside the cannon were stacked canisters of\r\ngrapeshot and flannel bags of powder. In a few minutes, Raoul thought\r\nwith pleasure, that grape would be sending a heap of red devils to Hell.\r\n\r\nAs the _Victory_ steamed around the tip of the island, Raoul searched\r\nthe forest with his telescope. He guessed the island to be a quarter of\r\na mile long. It was deeply forested enough to conceal hundreds of\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\nMidway along, he saw a gleam of sun on brown skin in the shrubbery near\r\nthe river's edge. He swung the telescope back to the spot. Nothing now.\r\nBut the quarry was there, all right. His lips drew back from his teeth.\r\n\r\n\"Captain Bill,\" he called to the pilot house. \"Turn our bow toward the\r\nisland. Kingsbury, get ready to fire.\"\r\n\r\nKingsbury saluted and called orders to the gun crew. A gunner slid a bag\r\nof powder into the six-pounder's muzzle and rammed it home. Another\r\npushed a canister of grapeshot in after it. The third held the burning\r\nlinstock ready.\r\n\r\nRaoul called to the bridge. \"Captain, hold her position.\" The captain\r\nwaved acknowledgment from behind the glass, and Raoul heard him ring a\r\nbell relaying his orders belowdecks. A moment later levers clanked and\r\nRaoul felt the deck tremble as the paddle wheels on the sides of the\r\nship reversed themselves.\r\n\r\n\"Shoot when you're ready, Lieutenant,\" Raoul said.\r\n\r\n_God, how I love this!_\r\n\r\nKingsbury shouted, \"Fire!\"\r\n\r\nThe gun thundered, deafening him, and leaped back in its cradle of\r\ntackle. Raoul watched the woods eagerly as a white smoke cloud spread\r\nover the water. On the island, branches flew in all directions. A big\r\ntree fell. He heard a scream followed by a series of wailing cries. He\r\nalmost cried aloud with pleasure.\r\n\r\nAn Indian staggered out from behind the trunk of a tall pine. He\r\ndragged one leg, a useless mass of bloody meat, and fell heavily to the\r\nground. He held a rifle. He shook his fist at the _Victory_, then aimed\r\nthe rifle from his prone position.\r\n\r\nIn sudden fear, Raoul was about to duck behind a hay bale when a dozen\r\nshots cracked out from the railings beside him. Bleeding from his chest\r\nand his head, the Indian collapsed and rolled into the Mississippi.\r\nNodding happily, Raoul watched the current catch his body. It drifted\r\nslowly downstream, trailing blood.\r\n\r\n\"Keep firing!\" Raoul roared. A cannoneer swabbed inside the gun barrel\r\nto cool it down for more powder. In a moment the gun boomed out again.\r\nMore trees splintered, but no more Indians were flushed out.\r\n\r\n\"Raise elevation ten degrees,\" Kingsbury called to the gunners. \"They're\r\nprobably lurking farther back in the woods.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul heard the clicks as the gunners used hand spikes to raise the\r\ncannon in its carriage.\r\n\r\nAfter the cannon went off, dirt and broken tree limbs sprayed out of the\r\nforest, and Raoul heard shrieking sounds that he hoped were the screams\r\nof Indians.\r\n\r\nThe cannon boomed again and again. With hand signals to Captain Bill in\r\nthe pilot house, Raoul had the _Victory_'s bow swung to starboard and\r\nthen to port, so that the grapeshot struck the island in a wide arc.\r\nTrees slowly toppled over, and shrieks of pain and shouts of rage and\r\ndefiance pierced the silence between the roars of the cannon.\r\n\r\nHe pictured the lead balls tearing into howling Indians, ripping their\r\nflesh apart. He remembered Helene's body in Lake Michigan. He remembered\r\nBlack Salmon's lash on his back. He saw--as he had seen them two weeks\r\nago--the heap of blackened, split logs that had been Victoire, his home,\r\nthe place where Clarissa, Phil and Andy died. He saw the mound of earth\r\nin the family cemetery where they lay together. What little had been\r\nleft of them.\r\n\r\nThe cannon's heat was his rage. The cannon's boom was his roar. The\r\ngrapeshot was his vengeance. He hurled his hatred over the water and\r\ninto the trees, blowing Indian bodies to shreds.\r\n\r\nHe heard something hum past his head and plunk into the pilot house\r\nbehind him. He saw smoke puff from the shadowy base of a clump of\r\nspruces. Another puff, and another. The reports of rifles carried across\r\nthe water.\r\n\r\n\"Sir!\" Kingsbury's hand gripped his shoulder, the fingers digging in.\r\n\r\nRaoul realized he had been momentarily out of his mind with fury.\r\nBreathing heavily, he got his eyes focused on the brown-mustached\r\nlieutenant.\r\n\r\n\"Get down, sir, before you get hit.\"\r\n\r\nReluctantly, because he wanted to see where the grapeshot was hitting,\r\nRaoul crouched down behind a hay bale. When he'd first come out on deck\r\nhe'd been afraid of being shot at. Now he felt sure they couldn't hit\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe six-pounder repeatedly tore into the area on shore where powder\r\nsmoke had appeared. Raoul saw no sign of Indian bodies, but the firing\r\nfrom the trees stopped.\r\n\r\n\"Gawd, I'd hate to be on the angry side of this gun,\" said Levi Pope.\r\n\r\nA dozen or more Indians burst from the trees and dove into the water.\r\nSome of them started swimming out toward the _Victory_; others turned\r\nsouth, following the current. Some just splashed helplessly.\r\n\r\n\"Shoot!\" Raoul shouted.\r\n\r\nGleefully, he ran into the pilot's house and grabbed his breech-loading\r\nHall rifle. He rushed back to stand by the rail. He took aim at the\r\nnearest Indian in the water. He heard his breath coming heavy, as it did\r\nwhen he was in bed with a woman.\r\n\r\nOnly the warrior's shaven head, scalplock flowing behind, was far enough\r\nout of the water to present a clear target. The Indian seemed to be\r\ntrying to swim past the _Victory_, toward the distant shore opposite.\r\nRaoul took his time aiming at the shiny brown dome and pulled the\r\ntrigger. He saw a splash of red, then the Indian's arms and legs stopped\r\nmoving and the body drifted southward with the current.\r\n\r\nPushing cloth-wrapped bullets down the tight, rifled bores of their\r\nmuzzle-loaders with practiced speed, Raoul's men could easily get off\r\nthree shots or more in a minute. The sky blue of the river soon turned\r\nred with blood from bodies that floated swiftly away.\r\n\r\n\"Yee-hah!\" Hodge Hode yelled. \"This is more fun than huntin' wild\r\ngoose.\"\r\n\r\n\"The ones we do not get, they will drown,\" said Armand Perrault. \"There\r\nis no place for them to swim to.\"\r\n\r\nIt was true; the opposite shore of the Mississippi was too far away, and\r\nthis shore was lined with Federal troops and state militia, who would\r\nshoot any swimming redskin they saw. The Indians must have known they\r\nwere doomed, but still they came on, little groups jumping into the\r\nwater, each one probably hoping to be lucky enough to escape alive. Most\r\nof the heads Raoul saw in the water streamed black hair; must be women\r\nand children, not scalplocked warriors.\r\n\r\nBut it didn't really matter what they were.\r\n\r\n_They killed my woman and my kids._\r\n\r\nHe saw a head trailing long black hair and blood in the water not ten\r\nfeet off the starboard bow. Close enough to see it was a boy. He was\r\ntrying desperately to swim with one arm, his face distorted with agony.\r\nRaoul aimed his rifle between the wide, terrified eyes that stared into\r\nhis own. He pulled the trigger. The brown face sank below the water.\r\n\r\n_That's for Phil and Andy._\r\n\r\nGroups of Indians threw themselves into the river from the distant parts\r\nof the island, but the steamboat turned quickly upstream and downstream,\r\nback and forth again and again, to pursue them, Raoul's sharpshooters\r\nwiping out each party of swimmers in turn. Captain Bill might not enjoy\r\nthis work, but he did it well.\r\n\r\nRaoul heard himself laughing under his breath as he thought of all the\r\nIndians who were dying before his eyes, because of _his_ ship and _his_\r\ncannon and _his_ riflemen.\r\n\r\nThen the _Victory_ resumed steaming slowly along the length of the\r\nisland, stopping at intervals for the cannoneers to blast the forest.\r\nKingsbury changed elevation with each shot, so that showers of grapeshot\r\nblanketed the island from side to side.\r\n\r\nFinally Raoul decided that they had done all they could from the ship.\r\nAll that blood in the water made a fine sight, made him yearn all the\r\nmore to wet his hands with blood.\r\n\r\nClimbing back up to the pilot house, he said, \"Take her to the south end\r\nof the island, Captain Bill. As close as you can. We're going to land.\"\r\n\r\nHelmer stared at him, but said nothing.\r\n\r\nHe'd better say nothing.\r\n\r\nRaoul took his pistol out of its holster and checked to see that it was\r\nprimed and loaded. He unsheathed his replica of Bowie's knife. He\r\nhefted it, heavy as a meat cleaver, in his hand and tested the edge with\r\nhis thumb. It would cut. By God, it would cut. He slid it back into its\r\nsheath.\r\n\r\nHe opened his mouth, gulping air in his excitement. His hands tingled\r\nand his whole body felt as if it were growing bigger. He wanted to kill\r\nIndians. He wanted to wade in their blood. Maybe find Black Hawk himself\r\nand take his scalp with the big Bowie knife. He hoped there would be\r\nhundreds of redskins still alive, cowering on that island. He needed to\r\nkill them by the hundreds.\r\n\r\nThe ship's progress down the length of the island seemed to take\r\nforever.\r\n\r\nHe tried to calm himself. After that bombardment with grapeshot, after\r\nso many Indians had been shot trying to swim away, there probably\r\nwouldn't be many left alive on the island. It wouldn't really be a\r\nfight; they'd be close to helpless.\r\n\r\n\"After we're ashore,\" he said to Helmer, \"take the ship over to the\r\ntroops on the Mississippi bank and tell General Atkinson we've found the\r\nmain body of the Sauk. Tell him to send as many men as the _Victory_\r\nwill carry.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe steamboat's shallow draft allowed her to move in close, so Raoul and\r\nhis dozen Smith County boys could jump down into knee-deep water,\r\nholding rifles, bayonets screwed in place, and pistols and cases of\r\ncartridges and shot over their heads. The water was cold and clammy\r\nthrough Raoul's flannel trousers, and his feet squelched in his boots.\r\n\r\nThe _Victory_ drew away with a thumping of her engine and puffs of\r\nthick, black smoke from her two smokestacks. Just the sight of that\r\nsteamship should have been enough to scare hell out of the Indians,\r\nRaoul thought.\r\n\r\nHe and his men clambered up sloping rocks to stand in a clear area of\r\nlevel ground. Just where the woods started, the upper half of an Indian\r\nlay on his back, trailing long, bloody ribbons of gut. The eyes were\r\nopen, staring.\r\n\r\n_Now, that's what I wanted to see._\r\n\r\n\"Remember that we take no prisoners,\" he said.\r\n\r\nHodge Hode said, \"Well, come on, let's knock them 'coons out of the\r\ntrees.\"\r\n\r\nAn arrow punched through Hodge's neck from front to back.\r\n\r\nRaoul's heart stopped, then thumped so hard with fear that he thought it\r\nmight split his chest open.\r\n\r\nHodge dropped his rifle and fell to the ground, gagging.\r\n\r\nRaoul went down on his knees beside Hodge, seized the arrow just under\r\nits knife-sharp flint head and pulled it through. As the feathered end\r\nwent through his neck Hodge made a retching sound. His tongue stuck out\r\nof his mouth.\r\n\r\nRaoul cursed under his breath as he bent over Hodge. This couldn't be\r\nhappening.\r\n\r\nMore arrows were flying past them. Raoul's men fired a ragged volley\r\ninto the woods, and the arrows stopped.\r\n\r\nThe arrow had cut through an artery and pierced Hodge's windpipe. His\r\nbreath whistled in and out through the hole in his throat, his blood\r\npumping out of him and soaking into his red beard.\r\n\r\n\"He is going,\" said Armand, kneeling beside Raoul.\r\n\r\n\"Aw no,\" Hodge managed to murmur.\r\n\r\nRaoul felt sick as he watched blood fill Hodge's mouth and pour out of\r\nit. Then the big man went limp and his eyes rolled up in his head.\r\n\r\n\"Let's get the bastards!\" Raoul growled. He was left scared as hell by\r\nHodge's death, but he was damned if he'd show it.\r\n\r\nThey climbed over big branches knocked down by the _Victory_'s cannon\r\nand ran in among the trees, Raoul taking the lead. Spruce branches\r\nwhipped his face.\r\n\r\n_I must be crazy, charging into the woods like this. We could all get\r\nwhat Hodge got._\r\n\r\nHigh-pitched war whoops shrilled out of the forest shadows ahead, and\r\nmore arrows whistled at them.\r\n\r\nKnowing it was only luck that none of them hit him, Raoul wanted\r\ndesperately to fire his rifle into the forest. But he forced himself not\r\nto shoot until he could see a target.\r\n\r\nBrown figures rushed toward him, darting from tree to tree. He fired at\r\na warrior leaping between the thick trunks of two pines. The Indian\r\ndisappeared, but Raoul was sure he'd missed. He jerked the breech of his\r\nrifle open and slapped in another ball-and-powder cartridge with frantic\r\nspeed.\r\n\r\nThe same Indian reappeared from behind another tree only six feet away.\r\nRaoul brought the rifle up and fired. The Indian fell over backward.\r\n\r\nAnother brave leaped at him from the side, swinging a tomahawk. Raoul\r\nshifted his rifle to his left hand and pulled out his Bowie knife. The\r\nIndian's eyes were huge and white and wild. His upraised arms left his\r\nchest wide open, ribs showing so sharp you could count them. Raoul\r\nlunged, thrusting the knife. The Indian's rush drove him onto the blade.\r\nHis tomahawk came down on Raoul's forearm. It hurt, but it didn't even\r\nhit hard enough to cut through Raoul's sleeve. Raoul planted his foot in\r\nthe already-dead Indian's belly and jerked the knife out of his body.\r\n\r\nAs the warrior collapsed, Raoul noticed that his face was bare brown\r\nskin devoid of paint. They'd even run out of war paint, he thought. In\r\nthe middle of this battle, that gave him a moment of pleasure.\r\n\r\nRifles were going off on both sides of him. Levi Pope fired into the\r\nupper branches of an elm tree and whooped as a warrior's body came\r\ncrashing down. The air was full of blinding, bitter smoke.\r\n\r\nThen silence. Motionless Indians lay on the forest floor.\r\n\r\nBut so did two more of Raoul's own men. One lay face down, perfectly\r\nstill. The other was on his back, head propped against a tree trunk. An\r\narrow, feathers black and white, stuck out of his chest. His eyes were\r\nopen but saw nothing. His arms and empty hands jerked, the movements\r\nless like a human being's than like a dying insect's. Raoul felt bile\r\nrising in his throat and bit his lips hard to stop himself from puking.\r\n\r\n_That could just as easily have been me._\r\n\r\nAnother man had an arrow in his arm. Armand pulled it out of him with a\r\nmighty jerk. The man screamed, and Armand clapped a big hand over his\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\nRaoul's nine remaining men looked from the two dead men--the second\r\nman's arms had stopped jerking--to Raoul. Were they just waiting for\r\norders, or were they accusing him?\r\n\r\n\"Injuns're gettin' ready for another charge,\" Levi Pope said. \"I can see\r\nthem skulkin' out there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pull back!\" Raoul ordered. \"Pick up those dead men's rifles.\" His voice\r\nrang out strangely in the still forest.\r\n\r\nReloading and walking backward, rifles pointed up, Raoul and his men\r\nretreated to the tip of the island. Armand carried the extra rifles.\r\nThey piled up fallen trees to make a hasty barricade.\r\n\r\nRaoul lay behind tree trunks long enough for the sweat to cool on his\r\nbody. Mosquitoes and little black flies stung him incessantly. He\r\nwondered if the Indians would ever attack. He'd gotten himself into a\r\nvery bad spot.\r\n\r\nRifles went off, and bullets plunked into the tree barricade. Brown\r\nbodies came leaping out of the forest. Raoul suddenly remembered how the\r\nIndians had rushed out from behind the Lake Michigan dunes twenty years\r\nago, and for a moment he was a terrified little boy. His hands shook so\r\nviolently he almost dropped his rifle.\r\n\r\nWith shrill yips and yells Indians came at them. Arrows and bullets\r\nwhizzed over the heads of Raoul's men as they ducked down behind their\r\nshelter. Raoul forced himself to concentrate on shooting. He poked his\r\nrifle through an opening between broken tree limbs, aimed at a running\r\nIndian and fired.\r\n\r\nHis two remaining close companions in this war, Levi and Armand, lay\r\nshooting on either side of him. Hodge was dead, his body sprawled a few\r\nfeet behind them, and that by itself brought Raoul close to panic. He\r\nhad always felt the big redheaded backwoodsman could never be hurt.\r\n\r\nArrows flew thick and fast. Raoul and his men, reloading from the\r\ncartridge and shot cases they had carried ashore, kept up a steady\r\nanswering fire.\r\n\r\nHe felt shame smouldering in his spine and along his limbs. What a\r\ndamned fool he'd been. He had been so sure that storm of grapeshot from\r\nthe _Victory_ would finish off the Indians. He had expected this to be\r\nnothing more than a stroll through the forest, counting the dead and\r\nkilling off the helpless remnant. Instead it seemed there were plenty of\r\nSauk warriors left, very much alive, fierce as wolverines. And he and\r\nhis men were trapped at the tip of this damned island with no place to\r\nretreat but the river. In the river they'd be helpless under enemy\r\narrows and bullets, just like the redskins who had tried earlier to swim\r\naway.\r\n\r\nThe Sauk war cries had fallen silent, and the shots and arrows had\r\nstopped. Raoul peered through a chink in the tree trunks piled before\r\nhim. All he could see was dark green boughs with no sign of movement.\r\n\r\n\"What you figger they're doing now?\" Levi said. He had his six pistols\r\nlaid out on a log in front of him.\r\n\r\n\"Probably getting ready to charge us,\" said Raoul.\r\n\r\nHow long before the _Victory_ got back? From here at the south end of\r\nthe island he could see the white steamship anchored off the riverbank,\r\nher two black stacks giving off little white puffs, her side paddle\r\nwheels motionless. She looked very small and very far away. No chance\r\nHelmer or Kingsbury could see that Raoul and his men were fighting for\r\ntheir lives here.\r\n\r\nWhat were the men, Levi and Armand and the others, thinking? Again and\r\nagain, it seemed, his decisions cost lives. He remembered Old Man's\r\nCreek--de Marion's Run--and he felt his face get fiery hot at the shame\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nAnd then there was Eli Greenglove's bitterness that night they parted,\r\naccusing him of putting Clarissa and the boys in harm's way. And\r\nsomething about a shock Raoul would get--what had Eli meant by that?\r\n\r\nHe heard a splash and turned to look behind him. His heart stopped. A\r\nnear-naked Indian was rushing at him out of the water, scalping knife\r\nhigh.\r\n\r\nHands trembling, Raoul had barely time to roll over on his back and fire\r\nhis rifle up at the screaming warrior. Sunlight glinted off the long\r\nsteel blade. There was a moment of black terror after the rifle went\r\noff. Nothing seemed to happen. His hands had been shaking too hard, he\r\nthought, to aim well.\r\n\r\nBut then the Sauk dropped to his knees and fell over on his side. The\r\nknife dropped from his hand. Seeing he was safe for this instant, Raoul\r\ntook another ball-and-powder cartridge out of his case and shoved it\r\ninto the breech.\r\n\r\nThe Indian rolled over and pushed himself up on his hands and knees, a\r\nlong string of blood and spittle dangling from his mouth. Calmer now,\r\nRaoul took careful aim and put a bullet in the shaven brown skull.\r\n\r\nTwo more dripping Indians were charging out of the water. Rifles went\r\noff beside Raoul. One Sauk fell, then the other, just as he was swinging\r\nhis tomahawk at a man on the right end of Raoul's line.\r\n\r\nThe militiaman screamed. The steel head of the tomahawk was buried in\r\nhis buckskin-clad leg.\r\n\r\n\"See to him, Armand,\" Raoul said.\r\n\r\nArmand, crouching, ran over to the wounded man. But first he attended to\r\nthe fallen Indian next to him. He grabbed the brave's head and twisted\r\nit around. Raoul heard the crack of bones.\r\n\r\n\"To make bien sure,\" Armand said, teeth flashing in his brown beard.\r\n\r\nThree men dead, two wounded. Eight men left. Maybe a hundred Sauk\r\nwarriors out there, maybe more.\r\n\r\n_What a stupid time to die, right when the war's almost over._\r\n\r\nRaoul gnawed on the ends of his mustache and peered into the\r\nimpenetrable forest. He and his men were all going to die. He was sure\r\nof it. He felt fear, but more painful than the fear was an ache in his\r\nheart for all that he was going to lose--all that was due him that life\r\nhadn't paid out to him like he deserved. He wanted so much to live.\r\n\r\nA line of Indians came out of the trees, some with rifles, some with\r\nbows and arrows. There must be twenty or thirty of them. They weren't\r\nwhooping, as they usually did. They were silent, their eyes big, their\r\nmouths set in lipless lines. They were like walking dead men, coming at\r\nhim. That was what they were. They knew they were going to die, but they\r\nwere going to take this little band of white men with them.\r\n\r\nRaoul had all he could do to keep from curling up behind his tree\r\nbarricade, head in his arms, whimpering with grief and fear. He made\r\nhimself aim and fire. The Indian he'd picked out as a target kept on\r\ncoming.\r\n\r\n_We're done for_, he thought, over and over again. _We're done for._\r\n\r\nSlowly--he did not seem able to move quickly--he inserted another\r\ncartridge into the breech of his rifle. All around him rifles were going\r\noff with deafening booms.\r\n\r\nAnd from behind him there was more booming.\r\n\r\nHe looked up. Indians were falling. One here, one there, then three,\r\nthen two more. Their line was breaking up.\r\n\r\n_God, the men are shooting good!_\r\n\r\nHe heard voices behind him and looked around.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment Levi Pope said, \"Well, here be a sight to welcome.\"\r\n\r\nTen feet or so behind him a line of men in coonskin caps and gray shirts\r\nwere methodically firing over his head. He'd been so lost in panic and\r\ndespair he hadn't heard them coming.\r\n\r\nHe looked back at the Indians. Brown bodies lay tumbled on the ground,\r\nsome only a few feet from his barricade. Those on their feet were\r\nbacking up. They melted into the tattered forest.\r\n\r\nFor a moment Raoul could not move. He lay clutching his rifle with a\r\ngrip so hard it hurt his hands, panting heavily.\r\n\r\n\"It's safe now,\" Levi Pope said quietly, standing up.\r\n\r\nRaoul pushed himself to his feet. His legs were shaking so hard he could\r\nbarely stand. He looked around and saw militiamen wading across to the\r\nisland from the east bank of the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nThe men who had been skirmishing in the forest north of the Bad Axe must\r\nhave seen the fighting on the island.\r\n\r\nToo dazed even to feel happy, Raoul stood taking long breaths and\r\nwatched the militiamen come.\r\n\r\nHe had never in his life needed a drink more than he did now, and he had\r\nforgotten to bring any whiskey with him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe southern tip of the island was soon crowded with riflemen. Raoul's\r\nthree dead were stretched out under blankets, and a burly horse doctor\r\nfrom the mining country was bandaging the leg of the man with the\r\ntomahawk wound.\r\n\r\n\"Colonel Henry Dodge,\" said a tall, whip-lean officer wearing a bicorn\r\nhat. He shook hands with Raoul. \"We're almost neighbors. I'm from\r\nDodgeville settlement, just a little ways north of Galena.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm damned glad you came over, Colonel,\" said Raoul, feeling like a\r\nfool to have gotten himself trapped. \"The Sauk still seem to have a\r\npower of fighting men left.\"\r\n\r\n\"Glad you saved a few for us. There were only about two dozen redskins\r\non the north side of the Bad Axe. They let us see them to draw us away,\r\nI guess, from the main body hiding out here. But the way you were\r\nblasting this island with grape, I was afraid we'd have nothing to do\r\nbut bury Indians. Or pieces of them.\"\r\n\r\nDodge ordered his men to spread out in two lines, one behind the other,\r\nacross the width of the island. Raoul positioned his little party in the\r\ncenter of the foremost line.\r\n\r\n\"Advance, my brave Suckers!\" Dodge called, and the men laughed at the\r\nnickname for Illinoisians. Holding up a long cavalry saber, Dodge led\r\nthe militia line, bayonets leveled, into the broken trees.\r\n\r\nRaoul looked downriver for the _Victory_. She had dropped a wooden ramp\r\nto the riverbank, and blue-uniformed regulars were boarding. When they\r\ngot here there would be enough soldiers on the island to wipe out the\r\nIndians ten times over.\r\n\r\nThat would be Zachary Taylor's outfit, from Fort Crawford. Raoul had\r\nheard that the five hundred Federal troops sent from the East had been\r\ndecimated by cholera, though their commander, Winfield Scott, was still\r\non the way here.\r\n\r\nRaoul turned and pushed forward, stumbling over tree trunks, shoving\r\nbranches out of the way with his rifle, muscles rigid against the arrow\r\nhe feared would come whistling out of the gloomy shadows ahead. He saw\r\nno living Indians, but many mangled corpses. He tripped over a bare,\r\nbrown severed leg. A moccasin, flaps decorated with undulating red,\r\nwhite and black beadwork, was still on the foot.\r\n\r\nThree Indians, swinging tomahawks and war clubs, sprang out from behind\r\na pile of grape-blasted birch trees. Raoul and the men flanking him\r\nstarted shooting. The Indians were riddled before they got within ten\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nRaoul was sure he'd killed one of the warriors. He went to the body,\r\ndrew his Bowie knife and gripped the long black scalplock. He carved a\r\ncircle with the sharp point in the shaved skin around the scalplock.\r\nWhite bone showed through when he pulled the patch of skin loose, the\r\nround spot quickly filling with blood.\r\n\r\nThe scalplock was long enough to let him tie it around his belt. The\r\nhair felt coarser than a white man's.\r\n\r\nThey pressed on into the forest, again and again meeting desperate\r\nlittle bands of red men, who rushed them only to be felled by a hail of\r\nlead balls. Raoul heard the constant banging of many rifles going off in\r\nother parts of the forest.\r\n\r\nAnd sometimes he heard the high screams of women and children. After the\r\nscreams, silence.\r\n\r\nRaoul smiled to himself. This was how he wanted it. No prisoners.\r\n\r\nKilling no longer seemed dangerous. It no longer felt like sport. It\r\nbecame simply work through the day's heat. It was tiring work, but good.\r\nWith some surprise Raoul realized that the line of troops had swept most\r\nof the island and were now approaching the north end. He could see\r\nIndians up ahead through the trees. This might well be the last of them.\r\nEagerly, rifle ready, he rushed forward.\r\n\r\nHe burst into a clearing and found himself facing a half circle of\r\nnearly a dozen bucks, their shaved scalps and bare chests gleaming with\r\nsweat. Behind them cowered a pack of squaws and children.\r\n\r\nThe warriors shouted at Raoul and his men and beckoned to them. Right in\r\nthe center was one man much taller than the rest, with the red and white\r\nfeathers of a brave tied into his scalplock. Whatever insults or\r\nchallenges he was uttering, he looked Raoul right in the eye and shouted\r\ndirectly at him.\r\n\r\nRaoul felt a chill of fear. The Indian's flesh was wasted, but his\r\nskeleton was huge. He looked like he'd be as hard to stop as a tornado.\r\nAnd he was holding a rifle in arms and hands so big that they made it\r\nlook small.\r\n\r\nThe other warriors didn't have rifles or even bows. They must have run\r\nout of powder and shot and arrows. They held clubs and knives and\r\ntomahawks.\r\n\r\n_They want us to fight hand to hand. That's what Indians do to show\r\ntheir courage._\r\n\r\n_The hell with that._\r\n\r\nWith a movement that seemed almost contemptuous, the big Indian dropped\r\nthe rifle to the ground. He reached down and picked up a war club\r\npainted red and black, with a huge spike at its end.\r\n\r\n\"Let's pay 'em back, boys!\" Raoul shouted. \"For all of our people they\r\nkilled.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oui! For Marchette,\" said Armand, raising his rifle. His first shot\r\ncaught a warrior in the chest and knocked him down.\r\n\r\nAt that the Indians rushed Raoul and his men.\r\n\r\nRaoul felt himself trembling uncontrollably as the bony giant in the\r\ncenter came straight at him. The big Indian held his war club in front\r\nof him, as if to deflect bullets.\r\n\r\nForcing his arms to hold steady, Raoul aimed his rifle at the Indian's\r\nhead and fired.\r\n\r\nAnd missed.\r\n\r\n_I should have aimed at his chest._\r\n\r\nRaoul cursed his shaking hand as he dropped his rifle and pulled his\r\npistol.\r\n\r\nThe brown giant gave a long, full-throated war cry.\r\n\r\nRaoul pulled the trigger. He saw a spark, heard the bang of the\r\npercussion cap, but there was nothing more. He cried out in a fury. His\r\nsweat must have dampened the powder.\r\n\r\nThe club came down on the pistol, and Raoul to his horror felt it\r\nknocked out of his hand. Again the big Indian screamed out his\r\nblood-freezing war whoop and raised the club high.\r\n\r\nRaoul's empty hand fumbled for his Bowie knife. He had it out, a death\r\ngrip on the hilt. He lunged at his enemy. A jolt ran through Raoul's arm\r\nto his shoulder as the point of the knife sank deep between two thick\r\nribs.\r\n\r\nThe Indian gave a deep groan and staggered back. He swung his club, but\r\ntoo late. Raoul felt a numbing blow just where his neck met his\r\nshoulder, and fell to his knees.\r\n\r\nHe was looking right into the dark brown eyes of the Indian, who had\r\nalso fallen. The eyes were unblinking, dead. The massive body collapsed\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\nRaoul shouted, a wordless cry of rage, and a red curtain swept over his\r\neyes. He jerked the knife out, releasing a cataract of blood. With an\r\neffort that wrenched his arms he hurled the brown giant away from him.\r\n\r\nTaking a scalp wasn't enough, after a fight like that. Raoul got a firm\r\ngrip on the thick, stiff-standing hank of black hair in the center of\r\nhis enemy's head and brought the knife down on the brown throat.\r\nChopping and slicing and sawing, as if butchering a steer, Raoul cut\r\nthrough the thick neck until at last the head came free.\r\n\r\nHe lofted the head in his left hand, looking up at the still-open dead\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\"There, you goddamned redskin son of a bitch! Thought you could kill me,\r\nhuh?\"\r\n\r\nA shrill woman's voice broke in on his triumph.\r\n\r\nHe turned to see a witchlike woman wrapped in a blanket. Her finger was\r\npointing at him. Her voice went on and on, screeching at him.\r\n\r\nShe was tall, but starvation had stripped the flesh from her bones. Her\r\nsunken eyes seemed to glow in her skull-like face. He felt as if he was\r\nfacing some horrid spectre.\r\n\r\nHe threw the warrior's head down. Curse him, would she? He snarled like\r\nan angry wolf as he reached for the woman. She didn't even try to get\r\naway. He seized the scrawny neck and pulled her to him, bringing the\r\nBowie knife's point up against her throat.\r\n\r\nShe started singing, a weird, high-pitched caterwauling. He'd heard\r\nsomething like it before. Where?\r\n\r\nWhen he'd been about to shoot Auguste and those two other Indians at Old\r\nMan's Creek. They'd sung like that right at the end.\r\n\r\nHer dark eyes held him. They were not clouded over with anger or terror,\r\nbut clear with full understanding that he was going to kill her. She was\r\nnot afraid. He wished he could frighten her, force her to grovel, but\r\nsomeone might try to stop him from doing it. Her voice went on and on,\r\nchanting, up and down.\r\n\r\nHe'd silence her now. Redskin bitch.\r\n\r\nHe drove the knife into her throat and jerked it sideways. Her song\r\nended in a sickening rasp.\r\n\r\nStill the brown eyes were fixed on him. Her blood spurted out of the\r\ngash he had cut open, splashed over his knife blade, poured hot on his\r\nhand. It spread down over her dress and over the gold lace on his\r\nsleeve. He looked down at his red hand and felt some force within him\r\nstretch his lips and bare his teeth.\r\n\r\nHe thrust the woman away from him. Her eyes were still open, but she\r\nlooked at no one and nothing. She fell to the ground like a bundle of\r\nsticks. She lay on her back, the deep wound in her throat spread wide,\r\nher eyes staring up.\r\n\r\nHe stood over her and saw that something shiny had fallen out of the\r\nfront of her dress and lay beside her head. Tied around her neck with a\r\npurple ribbon was an oval metal case splashed with blood.\r\n\r\nHe had seen the case, or one like it. He reached down with the knife and\r\nslashed the ribbon. He wiped his knife on his jacket and slammed it into\r\nits sheath, then picked up the slippery case and opened it.\r\n\r\nA pair of spectacles. Round, gold frames, thick glass lenses.\r\n\r\nThey looked exactly like Pierre's old spectacles. Was that possible? How\r\ncould this Indian woman have gotten them? Stolen from Victoire, when the\r\nSauk burned it?\r\n\r\nOr had the mongrel somehow gotten his father's spectacles, taken them\r\nwith him when he fled from Victor? Pierre's watch had disappeared then;\r\nRaoul was sure Auguste had stolen it. And if this woman had Pierre's\r\nglasses now, could she be the Sauk woman Pierre had lived with, the\r\nmother of his bastard son?\r\n\r\nDespite the August heat beating down on the clearing, the air around\r\nRaoul suddenly felt winter cold. All day long while he fought the\r\nIndians he'd struggled with his fear of being killed. Now a worse fear\r\nhad him in its grip, a fear of something worse than death, of having\r\ncalled down upon himself a vengeance that would follow him beyond the\r\ngrave.\r\n\r\n_My God! I've just killed Pierre's squaw._\r\n\r\nThe spectacles stared up at him like accusing eyes. The flesh of his\r\nback prickled.\r\n\r\nHe shut the case and dropped it into his pocket. If it was Pierre's he\r\ncouldn't just throw it away.\r\n\r\nThe few remaining Indians, a flock of women and children, huddled\r\nweeping with their backs to a big tree, arms around one another. Some\r\nwere already wounded and screaming in pain.\r\n\r\nTiredly Raoul told himself he must reload rifle and pistol and get on\r\nwith the killing. But his anger was spent. He felt empty, worn out.\r\n\r\nFrom somewhere behind him came a shout of, \"Cease fire!\"\r\n\r\nIt was welcome. He'd done enough.\r\n\r\n\"Yonder come the bluebellies,\" said Levi.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, merde,\" muttered Armand, standing with red-dripping bayonet above a\r\npile of bodies.\r\n\r\nRaoul looked around. The order to stop the shooting had come from their\r\nrear, from a short, stout officer who, as Dodge had, was advancing with\r\ndrawn saber. Colonel Zachary Taylor.\r\n\r\nTaylor looked around the smoking glade at the dead, big bodies and\r\nlittle ones, brown flesh and tan deerskin splashed with bright red, eyes\r\nstaring, limbs helter-skelter.\r\n\r\n\"Jesus Christ.\" He turned to Raoul, pain in his bright blue eyes.\r\n\r\nRaoul felt his face grow hot. \"Colonel,\" he said, \"you understand why we\r\nhad to--\"\r\n\r\nTaylor's expression changed from sadness to weariness. \"I've been out on\r\nthe frontier for over twenty years. I don't see anything here that I\r\nhaven't seen before.\" He turned away before Raoul could answer and\r\ncalled, \"Lieutenant Davis!\"\r\n\r\nA tall young officer with a handsome, angular face came up to him and\r\nsaluted.\r\n\r\nTaylor said, \"Jeff, run ahead and make sure any Indians left on this\r\nisland get a chance to surrender.\" He turned to Raoul again, shaking his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n\"Why let them surrender?\" Raoul said.\r\n\r\n\"There's only a few left alive,\" said Taylor. \"And we're not going to\r\nkill them. And if you need a reason, it's because I wouldn't feel right\r\nabout it, and I know a lot of the men wouldn't feel right about it.\"\r\n\r\nTaylor turned to one of his men, a red-faced trooper with a thick blond\r\nmustache. \"Sergeant Benson, get me that Sauk man we captured. We'll be\r\nneeding to talk to the Indians. We want to find out what's happened to\r\nBlack Hawk.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul was painfully aware that Taylor's eyes had shifted to his right\r\nhand, covered with blood. He wanted to hide it behind his back.\r\n\r\nHe looked Raoul up and down. \"Good God, man. Do you know you've got\r\nblood all over you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Enemy blood,\" said Raoul.\r\n\r\n\"I see you've got a scalp tied to your belt,\" Taylor said. \"General\r\nAtkinson issued an order against mutilating enemy dead.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul felt himself shaking again, not with fear, but with anger. \"I saw\r\none of my best friends shot dead with an arrow through the throat\r\ntoday.\"\r\n\r\n\"And this?\" Taylor asked, pointing to the severed head of the big brave\r\nlying a few feet from Raoul's red-spotted boots. \"Was this to avenge\r\nyour friend too? You'd better get back to your steamship, Mr. de Marion.\r\nI don't think we have any more need of your services here.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not so much Taylor's words, but the mingled contempt and pity in\r\nhis voice that enraged Raoul. His fist clenched on the handle of his\r\nknife.\r\n\r\nTaylor wore a pistol and carried a saber, but he was a far smaller man\r\nthan Raoul, and his stout body, dressed today in a blue jacket and\r\nknee-high fringed buckskin boots, seemed to invite attack.\r\n\r\nTaylor's calm blue eyes went to Raoul's hand, then back to his face. He\r\nstood motionless, waiting.\r\n\r\n_God! What am I thinking? The regulars would shoot me down the minute I\r\ndrew this knife._\r\n\r\nRaoul silently beckoned to his men and started back through the broken\r\ntrees the way they had come.\r\n\r\nAfter walking a short distance, Raoul saw the sergeant Taylor had sent\r\nbehind the lines coming toward him with an Indian walking beside him.\r\n\r\nRaoul glanced at the Indian and stopped dead.\r\n\r\nHe felt as if the arrow he'd been expecting and fearing all day had\r\nfinally struck him.\r\n\r\n_There are no ghosts._\r\n\r\nBut Auguste couldn't be alive. He'd been shot to death at Old Man's\r\nCreek.\r\n\r\nWas this what killing Pierre's squaw had brought on him?\r\n\r\nThe man before him had gone hungry for a long time. His almost\r\nskull-like face was a chilling reminder of the woman whose throat Raoul\r\nhad slashed. But his gauntness also made him look more like Pierre than\r\never before. His buckskin leggings, like those of the Indians Raoul had\r\njust killed, were dirty and full of rips and holes. But the pale scar\r\nline running down his cheek, and those five parallel scars on his bare\r\nchest, left Raoul in no doubt who this was. Auguste's dark eyes burned\r\nat Raoul, alight with a fierce hatred.\r\n\r\nThe sergeant pulled Auguste by the arm. As the mongrel turned, Raoul\r\nsuddenly saw that the middle of his ear was missing, the empty space\r\nbordered by partly healed red flesh.\r\n\r\nStunned speechless, Raoul looked at Levi and Armand, who stared back at\r\nhim. They couldn't speak either. They were just as shaken.\r\n\r\nStill burning at Taylor's high-and-mighty dismissal of him, Raoul was\r\nstaggered by the shock of this meeting. But he saw one thing clear. All\r\nright, Auguste was still alive. That meant Raoul's revenge on the Sauk\r\nwas not complete. Auguste was a traitor. Auguste was a murderer. And\r\nRaoul was going to work day and night to get him hanged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n21\r\n\r\nThe Red Blanket\r\n\r\n\r\nLonging to hear that White Bear was safe, Redbird could not stop\r\nthinking about him. She sat cross-legged on the ground with Floating\r\nLily bundled in a blanket on her lap. She gazed out at the small lake\r\nwhere Black Hawk and his few remaining followers had set up camp. This\r\nwas a peaceful place, but with White Bear gone and her dread of what\r\nmight have happened to her loved ones at the Bad Axe, she could feel no\r\npeace.\r\n\r\n\"A lovely place, this lake,\" said Owl Carver, sitting beside her.\r\n\r\n_But it is far from White Bear._\r\n\r\nThe thought of White Bear's having to make his way through Winnebago\r\ncountry haunted her. She longed to look into the birch forest behind her\r\nlean-to and see him walking toward her through the white tree trunks.\r\n\r\nShe missed Yellow Hair and Woodrow too. They were to her another sister,\r\nanother son. She hoped that by now they were out of danger.\r\n\r\nShe had left so many people behind at the Bad Axe, people who had always\r\nbeen part of her life--Sun Woman, Iron Knife, her two sisters. In the\r\nseven days since Black Hawk had led their little group north on the\r\nridge trail leading to Chippewa country, there had been no word from the\r\nrest of the band.\r\n\r\nRedbird's fear for the people she loved was like a ferret eating away at\r\nher insides.\r\n\r\nFrom his medicine bag Owl Carver took the pale eyes time teller White\r\nBear had given him and opened its gold outer shell. Redbird saw black\r\nmarkings on its inner surface and two black arrows.\r\n\r\n_Could it tell me when White Bear will come back?_\r\n\r\nThe old shaman dangled the time teller by its gold chain over Floating\r\nLily's tiny head. The gold disk gave off a regular, clicking sound, like\r\nthe beating of a metal heart. Floating Lily's brown eyes opened wide and\r\nher flower-petal lips curved in a wide, toothless smile.\r\n\r\nEagle Feather, sitting beside Redbird, said, \"Grandfather? Is it right\r\nto use a sacred thing just to make the baby smile?\"\r\n\r\nOwl Carver smiled. His face these days seemed to have caved in. All of\r\nhis front teeth were gone, and his mouth was as sunken as Floating\r\nLily's, while his chin and his nose jutted out.\r\n\r\n\"A baby's smile is also a sacred thing.\"\r\n\r\nRedbird said, \"Have you asked the spirits what has become of the rest of\r\nour people?\"\r\n\r\nFrom a cord around his waist Owl Carver untied a medicine bag decorated\r\nwith a beadwork owl. He opened it, let little gray scraps sift through\r\nhis fingers and sighed.\r\n\r\n\"Last night I chewed bits of sacred mushroom,\" Owl Carver said. \"I saw\r\npale eyes' things--lodges that travel over the ground on trails made of\r\nmetal, smoking boats with bonfires in their bellies, villages as big as\r\nprairies. Crowds of pale eyes seemed to be cheering for me. It made no\r\nsense. It told me nothing about what happened at the Bad Axe. Maybe I\r\ntook too much.\"\r\n\r\nRedbird glanced down at Eagle Feather. His mouth was a circle, and his\r\nblue eyes as he stared up at Owl Carver were so wide that she could see\r\nthe whites above and below them. He strained toward Owl Carver, his\r\nlonging to follow his father and grandfather in the way of the shaman\r\nshowing in every line of his body.\r\n\r\nShe had always felt that same longing.\r\n\r\n\"Let me try your sacred mushrooms,\" said Redbird. \"Sun Woman says\r\nsometimes women can see into places where men cannot see.\"\r\n\r\nOwl Carver set the medicine bag down between himself and Eagle Feather.\r\nHe sliced his hand through the air, palm down, in refusal.\r\n\r\n\"The magic might get into your milk and be bad for the baby.\"\r\n\r\nResentment was a bitter taste in Redbird's mouth. But she had to admit\r\nthere was no telling what the mushrooms might do to Floating Lily's\r\nunformed spirit. Still, she knew Owl Carver welcomed that excuse because\r\nhe did not want to give the mushrooms to a woman.\r\n\r\nEagle Feather shouted, \"Look!\" He pointed up at the sky.\r\n\r\nOwl Carver and Redbird both looked up. Scanning the cloudless midday sky\r\nfor a moment, she saw two tiny black shapes high up, circling slowly.\r\n\r\n\"Eagles!\" said the boy. \"My guardian spirits.\"\r\n\r\nRedbird squinted. Yes, those were the wide-spreading wings of eagles.\r\nThe birds were searching for prey. Like the long knives and their\r\nWinnebago allies. Their remorseless circling frightened her.\r\n\r\nThose bright blue eyes of Eagle Feather's saw farther than hers did,\r\nthought Redbird. She looked down at him proudly, as he wiped his hand\r\nacross his mouth and smiled up at her. His pointed chin reminded her of\r\nWhite Bear.\r\n\r\n\"If the Winnebago find us here, will they kill us?\" she asked her\r\nfather.\r\n\r\nOwl Carver waved his hands. \"They are not our enemies, but they will do\r\nwhat the long knives demand.\"\r\n\r\nIn a strange voice Eagle Feather said, \"Mother?\"\r\n\r\nFrightened by his flat tone, she reached for him. But with the baby in\r\nher lap she could not get to him before Eagle Feather fell over on his\r\nside with his eyes shut.\r\n\r\nShe screamed.\r\n\r\nShe laid Floating Lily on the ground and picked up Eagle Feather. He lay\r\nlimp in her arms, his head lolling, his mouth hanging open.\r\n\r\nAfter all they had been through, this was more than she could bear. She\r\nburst into tears, her heart thudding like a deerskin drum.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" She turned to Owl Carver. \"Help him.\"\r\n\r\nThe shaman crouched over his grandson, looking down into his face,\r\nbending low to sniff his breath.\r\n\r\n\"Redbird, be very quiet. We must not wake him.\"\r\n\r\n\"What happened to him?\" she whispered, trembling.\r\n\r\n\"This.\" He gestured to the open medicine bag that lay where he and Eagle\r\nFeather had been sitting. \"He must have taken some bits of mushroom\r\nwhile we were looking up at the eagles.\"\r\n\r\nTerror cascaded over her. \"What will it do to him?\"\r\n\r\nOwl Carver emptied the gray scraps into his hand and then poured them\r\nback into the bag. \"What a foolish old man I am, leaving that bag open\r\nright next to him.\"\r\n\r\nEagle Feather had gone on a spirit journey. And her own sensitivity to\r\nthe other world told her that he was _meant_ to. She felt for him the\r\nfear she had felt for White Bear in that long-ago Moon of Ice.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Redbird sadly. \"You were not foolish. It was Earthmaker's\r\nway. He sent those eagles to take our eyes away from the medicine bag.\"\r\n\r\nWith infinite care, so as not to disturb him, Redbird carried Eagle\r\nFeather into the lean-to, resting his head on the blanket roll that held\r\neverything she had been able to carry.\r\n\r\n\"I will stay with you until Eagle Feather comes back,\" said Owl Carver.\r\nRedbird picked up Floating Lily and held her tightly.\r\n\r\nAs the sun crossed above the lake, they sat watching the small, still\r\nbody. Redbird could barely see Eagle Feather's narrow chest rise and\r\nfall in the shadowy lean-to. There were moments when she was sure he was\r\ndead.\r\n\r\nSunset had turned the small lake to a sheet of beaten gold when Eagle\r\nFeather sat up suddenly, his eyes wide.\r\n\r\n\"The Bad Axe!\" he shrieked. It was the voice of a child struggling with\r\na nightmare.\r\n\r\n\"Eagle Feather!\" Redbird cried.\r\n\r\nOwl Carver put his hand on her knee. \"Be quiet.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Bad Axe!\" Eagle Feather called out again, staring at something no\r\none else could see. \"The Great River runs red!\" His eyes closed and he\r\nfell back.\r\n\r\nRedbird felt as if she were shivering in a blizzard. Eagle Feather's\r\nwords seemed to open a doorway of second sight in her own mind,\r\ndisclosing a horrifying vision of bodies drifting in red-tinged water.\r\n\r\nShe heard a sound behind her. Suddenly terrified, she whirled. In the\r\nbirch forest she saw a man riding toward them on a gray pony. The beat\r\nof hooves sounded hollow among the trees.\r\n\r\nFeeling on the edge of madness, she let out a scream. She had wanted so\r\nmuch for White Bear to come to her that way, that she thought for a\r\nmoment it was he. Like White Bear's, his head was unshaved, his hair\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nBut as he came closer through the white tree trunks, a hand raised in\r\ngreeting, she saw he was not White Bear. His full head of hair had a\r\nbrave's feathers tied into it. A Winnebago. She saw a second rider\r\nbehind him. An attack? But they were approaching slowly, their hands\r\nempty.\r\n\r\nThe Winnebago dismounted and led his pony till he was standing over\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nHe wore four red and white feathers, one hanging from each silver\r\nearring, two tied into his hair. A leader of warriors. Heart pounding,\r\nshe moved protectively closer to the lean-to where Eagle Feather lay.\r\nOwl Carver slowly got to his feet. She glanced at him, and when she saw\r\nhow grim his face was, her own terror increased.\r\n\r\nAnother Winnebago rode out of the woods, dismounted and stood beside his\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\nThe first man turned to take something from his saddle.\r\n\r\nScooping Floating Lily up in her arms, Redbird leaped up to give the\r\nalarm. The brave held out a restraining hand.\r\n\r\n\"Wait! We are two only, and we come to talk peace.\" The man spoke Sauk.\r\n\r\nHe faced her, smiling tentatively, and held up a beautiful calumet, its\r\nred pipestone bowl gleaming in the sunset, its polished hickory stem as\r\nlong as a man's arm.\r\n\r\nOwl Carver drew himself up in all his white-haired shaman's majesty.\r\n\"Who are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am called Wave,\" said the man holding the calumet. \"This is He Who\r\nLights the Water. He does not speak Sauk.\"\r\n\r\nRedbird glanced down into the lean-to, to make sure Eagle Feather was\r\nall right.\r\n\r\n\"Who is in the lean-to?\" Wave asked a little suspiciously as He Who\r\nLights the Water stepped forward to look in.\r\n\r\n\"My grandson,\" said Owl Carver. \"He is sick.\"\r\n\r\n\"Many of you must be sick. And hungry,\" said Wave. \"Time your leaders\r\ntook pity on the women and children and ended this war.\"\r\n\r\nMore Sauk men and women were coming over now to see the newcomers. The\r\ntwo Winnebago were men of courage, Redbird thought, coming alone as they\r\nhad into a camp of fifty or more desperate people.\r\n\r\nRedbird's mother came to stand beside Owl Carver. She asked what was\r\nwrong with Eagle Feather, and Owl Carver explained in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\"Children will eat anything they can get their hands on,\" Wind Bends\r\nGrass scolded. \"Now he will probably grow up to be a madman.\" Redbird\r\nheld back a shriek of rage.\r\n\r\nBlack Hawk and the Winnebago Prophet strode through the gathering crowd\r\nto face the newcomers. Black Hawk carried under one arm one of those\r\nheavy paper bundles captured at Old Man's Creek. He glanced at Redbird,\r\nand she thought she saw reproach in his eyes, even though he had said he\r\nforgave her for her part in Yellow Hair's and Woodrow's escape.\r\n\r\nFlying Cloud addressed Wave in a strange tongue.\r\n\r\n\"This Winnebago brave is the son of my sister,\" said the Prophet\r\npompously in Sauk.\r\n\r\n_Does he think that means we are saved?_ Redbird wondered, sick of the\r\nWinnebago Prophet forever claiming that victory awaited just a little\r\nfarther along the trail, when it was so clear that the trail led only to\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nWave said in Sauk, \"My father is a Sauk who married into the Winnebago.\r\nSo I come to you as one joined with you by blood. We were sent by the\r\nchief of our band, Falcon.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did you find us?\" Black Hawk asked.\r\n\r\n\"One of our hunters was passing this way and saw your camp. He was\r\nafraid to come near you, but he told me. I have been looking for you for\r\nmany days.\"\r\n\r\nWolf Paw, his face so deeply lined that he looked as old as his father,\r\ncame to stand beside Black Hawk. \"Do you have news of our people who\r\nwere trying to cross the Great River?\" he asked. He touched the silver\r\ncoin that hung around his neck, as if for luck.\r\n\r\nDread flowed cold through Redbird's arms and legs.\r\n\r\n_Now we will know._\r\n\r\nWave and He Who Lights the Water looked at each other for a long, silent\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n\"What has happened?\" Black Hawk pressed them.\r\n\r\n\"The long knives caught up with them,\" said Wave. \"Most of the people\r\nwere hiding on an island in the Great River. The long knives had a smoke\r\nboat that fired a thunder gun at the island and killed many people. Then\r\nthe long knives landed on the island and killed nearly all that were\r\nleft.\"\r\n\r\nRedbird reeled, stunned.\r\n\r\n_Sun Woman! My second mother! Iron Knife! Oh, no! O Earthmaker, let it\r\nnot be so._\r\n\r\nCold crept over her as she remembered Eagle Feather's cry: _The Bad Axe!\r\nThe Great River runs red!_\r\n\r\nBlack Hawk gave a cry of anguish. His paper bundle dropped to the ground\r\nwith a thud. He sat down on the ground, picked up a handful of ashes\r\nfrom Redbird's campfire and threw them on his head. The people around\r\nhim screamed and wept and held one another in their grief.\r\n\r\nWind Bends Grass fell against Owl Carver, and both of them sank to the\r\nground weeping. Redbird saw Wolf Paw standing slumped and motionless,\r\nhis arms hanging helpless at his sides, his face gray. He had insisted\r\nthat both his wives and his four children try to cross the Great River\r\nat the Bad Axe, thinking they would be safer.\r\n\r\nSobbing and clutching her baby, Redbird watched the orange sun disappear\r\nbehind the pointed treetops on the western shore of the little lake. She\r\nthought, Iron Knife, so strong and always there when she needed him,\r\nmust be gone. Her two sisters and their new husbands, probably dead.\r\n\r\nThe people mourned, some sitting on the ground, some walking about\r\ndistractedly, some standing, holding each other.\r\n\r\nAnd now Eagle Feather was stricken. She could not get the chill out of\r\nher body.\r\n\r\nWhen it was dark she relit her fire. Floating Lily woke and cried, and\r\nRedbird held her to her breast. Then she crawled under her lean-to to\r\nlook at Eagle Feather. His eyes were still shut. He had not moved since\r\nhis outcry, and his breathing was shallow.\r\n\r\n_I cannot bear this. Eagle Feather lying as if dead, White Bear\r\nvanished, most of my people dead._\r\n\r\n_Why have I been spared to suffer so?_\r\n\r\nBlack Hawk began to mourn aloud for his lost people:\r\n\r\n\"Hu-hu-hu-u-u-u-u ... Whu-whu-whu-u-u-u-u ...\"\r\n\r\nThe rest of the people joined in the wailing. Redbird noticed that Wave\r\nand He Who Lights the Water cried out, too, and tears ran from their\r\neyes. She liked them for joining the mourning.\r\n\r\nOwl Carver was sitting beside her, holding the hands of weeping Wind\r\nBends Grass. His own features, as much of them as she could see in the\r\ntwilight, were still and drawn, shrunken by sorrow.\r\n\r\nRedbird thought, the Sauk were known far and wide as a people who never\r\nshirked the demands of honor. If even one man of Black Hawk's party\r\nsmoked the calumet with Wave, that would oblige Black Hawk and his\r\nremaining braves to surrender to the Winnebago and make peace.\r\n\r\nRedbird said, \"Now, with so many dead, can we have peace? Will you smoke\r\nthe pipe with these two men?\"\r\n\r\nOwl Carver said, \"If I were alone, I would smoke the pipe with them. But\r\nI will not go against Black Hawk.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are all that is left of the band,\" she said. \"Someone must take the\r\ncalumet and smoke it.\"\r\n\r\nAnd by that odious Sauk custom, she thought, clenching her jaw, it would\r\nhave to be a man.\r\n\r\nAs darkness deepened, the wailing died down. Wave and He Who Lights the\r\nWater made a little fire at the edge of the lake near Redbird's lean-to.\r\n\r\nOne by one the last people of Black Hawk's band drifted close to Wave's\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nThe Winnebago brave stood before the fire holding the peace pipe.\r\nTwilight lingered in the sky behind him while the firelight before him\r\nilluminated his heavy features.\r\n\r\nSitting near Eagle Feather, Redbird looked around and saw silent figures\r\nstanding in the shadows as the people waited to hear what Wave had to\r\nsay. Gravely he took tobacco out of a pouch at his waist and filled the\r\nbowl of the calumet. Then he touched a dry stick to his fire and carried\r\nthe flame to the pipe. It flared up bright yellow over the pipe bowl as\r\nhe puffed on it.\r\n\r\nWave cleared his throat and spoke in a strong voice. \"Earthmaker gave us\r\nthe sacred tobacco as a means of making peace among us. No one may break\r\na promise sealed with tobacco. Our chief, Falcon, asks me to say this to\r\nyou:\r\n\r\n\"Black Hawk, you have frightened the long knives greatly, brought them\r\nmuch sorrow, and forced them to pursue you over rivers and swamps and\r\nmountains. Black Hawk, your honor has been satisfied. Falcon offers this\r\ntobacco to you and asks that you end this war, for the sake of your\r\nwomen who are hungry and sick and your children who are without\r\nfathers.\"\r\n\r\n_Yes, let it be done. Let this war be over before all of us are dead._\r\n\r\nRedbird's heart leaped with hope as she saw Black Hawk reach toward the\r\npipe that Wave held out to him. He was about to take it and smoke it!\r\nBut his hand, instead of grasping, only pointed at the pipe.\r\n\r\n\"I will not smoke this pipe. I believe the Sauk should fight on until\r\nthey cannot fight anymore.\"\r\n\r\n_Please, Earthmaker, let at least one man be moved to stand for peace._\r\n\r\nWave added more tobacco to the pipe and puffed on it again. He stood\r\nbefore the Winnebago Prophet.\r\n\r\n\"Show your wisdom, Uncle. Smoke the sacred tobacco.\"\r\n\r\nFlying Cloud took a step backward and raised both arms. \"It is wrong for\r\nthe Winnebago to turn against us in our time of need. Go back and tell\r\nyour Chief Falcon that if he does not join us in making war on the long\r\nknives, they will take his land from him as they have taken ours from\r\nus.\" He crossed his arms before his chest.\r\n\r\nDespairing, Redbird realized that the Winnebago Prophet could not smoke\r\nthe pipe because that would be admitting that all his advice up to now\r\nhad been wrong.\r\n\r\n\"What will you do, Sauk shaman?\" Wave said to Owl Carver. \"Do not the\r\nspirits tell you to smoke the calumet?\"\r\n\r\n\"Please do it, Father,\" Redbird whispered.\r\n\r\nShe wanted to shout it aloud. But she held her tongue. She remembered\r\nwith pain the derision of Wolf Paw and the others when she spoke out at\r\nthe war council.\r\n\r\nShe bit her lip. Maybe, by speaking out that time, she had turned people\r\naway from the path she wanted them to take. She would not make that\r\nmistake again.\r\n\r\nOwl Carver said, \"Black Hawk has always been my chief. I follow where he\r\nleads.\"\r\n\r\nRedbird groaned. Now she wished she had spoken out.\r\n\r\nEagle Feather stirred beside her. Heart frozen, she looked down at him.\r\nBut he was motionless again.\r\n\r\nWave turned next to Wolf Paw, who closed his eyes, bowed his head and\r\nmade no move to accept the pipe. Redbird saw that the red crest on his\r\nhead was faded and limp.\r\n\r\nShe could only watch as the two Winnebago went from man to man in the\r\ncircle of firelight, holding out the pipe, each man refusing.\r\n\r\n\"Please,\" Wave pleaded, \"is there not a man here wise and strong enough\r\nto smoke the calumet and save the lives of his people? Please--more pain\r\nand death is needless.\"\r\n\r\nIn a day or two a war band of Winnebago would come after Black Hawk's\r\nparty. They would greatly outnumber these fifty people. They would have\r\nrifles with plenty of powder and shot, given to them by the long knives.\r\nThey would slaughter the men and take the women and children into\r\ncaptivity.\r\n\r\n_Earthmaker, I beg you, do not let your children die._\r\n\r\nShe heard a rustling beside her. She gasped in fright and her hands went\r\ncold.\r\n\r\nEagle Feather was up on his hands and knees.\r\n\r\nThe boy crawled out from under the lean-to, climbed to his feet and\r\nstood straight.\r\n\r\nA half-moon hung over the little lake, and she could see Eagle Feather's\r\nset face, one side red with firelight and the other pale white in\r\nmoonlight. His bright blue eyes fixed on Wave, he strode forward, a\r\nsmall, determined figure.\r\n\r\nAstonished, Redbird could only stand and watch. How could this be\r\nhappening?\r\n\r\nHe stood before Wave and held up his hands. For a moment there was\r\nsilence in the camp, disturbed only by the crackling of the fire and the\r\nrustling of the birch leaves around them.\r\n\r\n\"No!\" Black Hawk cried, his rasping voice full of anguish. \"Do not do\r\nit!\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop!\" The Winnebago Prophet reached for Eagle Feather. Owl Carver\r\nquickly blocked his way.\r\n\r\n\"You must not touch him. He returns from a spirit walk.\"\r\n\r\nSolemnly Wave handed the pipe down to Eagle Feather.\r\n\r\nOthers took up the cry. \"No! No!\" But no one laid a hand on Eagle\r\nFeather.\r\n\r\nAnd many were silent, and Redbird knew that she was not the only one in\r\nthe camp who wanted Eagle Feather to smoke the pipe.\r\n\r\nAwed, Redbird realized that the spirits hovered over Eagle Feather,\r\nguiding him. Her son had been chosen to save the remnant of the band,\r\nthough only six summers had passed since his birth. She felt her mouth\r\ntrembling.\r\n\r\nEagle Feather put the mouthpiece of the pipe to his lips and drew in. A\r\ndeep puff. Though he was but six years old and had never smoked before,\r\nhe showed no pain as the hot smoke filled his tender mouth, nor did he\r\ncough. Redbird's heart swelled with pride.\r\n\r\nEagle Feather blew the smoke out again. A single puff, according to\r\ncustom.\r\n\r\nWave's thick features were breaking in tearful relief.\r\n\r\nEagle Feather had known just what to do. And there could be no doubt in\r\nanyone's mind that he meant to do what he had done. He held the pipe up\r\nto Wave.\r\n\r\nA new cry of pain rose from Black Hawk, and the Winnebago Prophet joined\r\nhim as loudly.\r\n\r\nBut Redbird's heart was happy. She hugged Floating Lily.\r\n\r\nTheir long agony was over at last.\r\n\r\nEagle Feather turned and walked back to her, straight and steady, as if\r\nhe had not been lying all day long unconscious. She quickly handed\r\nFloating Lily to Wind Bends Grass, knelt down and held her arms out to\r\nher son. He ran into them, and they held each other tightly.\r\n\r\n\"It was good that you smoked the pipe. Very good.\"\r\n\r\nEagle Feather said, \"When the eagles came over the lake, my spirit self\r\nwhispered to me to eat from Grandfather's medicine bag. Then I went to\r\nmany strange places and saw many very bad things. The long knives killed\r\nmany people. At the end of it all, I lay in the lean-to and I heard a\r\nvoice say that if someone would smoke the calumet there would be peace.\r\nAnd my father's spirit self, the White Bear, came to me and told me to\r\nsmoke.\"\r\n\r\n_If White Bear had been here he would have smoked the calumet. I know he\r\nwould._\r\n\r\nOwl Carver put his hand on Eagle Feather's shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"The boy is the grandson of Owl Carver and of Sun Woman. He is the son\r\nof White Bear. He has had his first vision. It is foreordained that he\r\nshould be a Great Shaman.\"\r\n\r\nRedbird felt flames burning under the skin of her face.\r\n\r\n\"He is the son of Redbird as well,\" she said, her voice shaking.\r\n\r\nOwl Carver put his other hand on Redbird's shoulder. \"Yes, he is your\r\nson.\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly his old face crumbled. \"And all my other children are gone,\" he\r\nwept. \"Redbird, you are the only one left.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRedbird trembled as she saw Fort Crawford, a great square formed by long\r\nstone lodges connected by log palisade walls. Hard-faced long knives in\r\nblue jackets surrounded the Sauk, pointing rifles at them. Redbird drew\r\nthe sling in which she carried Floating Lily around from her back to\r\nhold her tight. With one hand she pulled Eagle Feather, who stumbled\r\nunder a heavy blanket roll, close to her.\r\n\r\n\"You will all camp in the field beside the fort,\" said Wave. \"If anyone\r\ntries to escape, those left behind will be punished.\"\r\n\r\nRedbird heard a wordless cry from behind her. She turned and was\r\nastonished to see a group of gray shadows standing in a meadow outside\r\nthe fort. She saw they were Sauk women, some holding babies, some with\r\nsmall children standing beside them.\r\n\r\nRedbird swung Floating Lily around to her back and rushed to the silent\r\nwomen, praying that among them she would see Sun Woman or her sisters.\r\nShe moved more slowly as she realized that the eyes of each silent face\r\nshe peered into were lifeless and the mouths slack.\r\n\r\nThese few, she grasped with horror, were all that was left of the people\r\nwho had tried to cross the Great River at the Bad Axe. Just as White\r\nBear had predicted.\r\n\r\nShe came to Water Flows Fast, barely able to recognize her. She had\r\nchanged terribly, a change that had begun when the long knives killed\r\nher husband, Three Horses, at Old Man's Creek. The older woman's face\r\nhad lost its roundness. Her cheeks sagged and her head shook with a\r\nconstant tremor.\r\n\r\n\"Is it really you, Redbird? In the flesh? I am not on the Trail of\r\nSouls?\"\r\n\r\nRedbird drew Water Flows Fast to her.\r\n\r\n\"Redbird, they killed everybody. They kept killing and killing. They\r\nwould not stop. Even babies. I don't know why I'm still alive. My\r\nchildren are dead. They tried to swim away, and the long knives shot\r\nthem in the water.\"\r\n\r\nWild Grape, Redbird's younger sister, rushed up to her. They fell into\r\neach other's arms, weeping. Redbird had never loved her sister as much\r\nas she did at this moment.\r\n\r\nWild Grape said, \"I saw Robin's Nest die. She stood before a long knife.\r\nShe was holding her baby son. She begged for her life. He just smiled\r\nand shot her. She dropped the baby, and the long knife shot him on the\r\nground. They would have killed me, but a long knife chief came along and\r\nstopped it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Iron Knife?\" Redbird asked. \"What about Iron Knife?\"\r\n\r\nWild Grape drew back and looked at Redbird with huge eyes. \"Redbird, one\r\nof them cut off Iron Knife's head.\"\r\n\r\nRedbird screamed as Wild Grape babbled on.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, with a knife this big.\" She held her hands wide apart. \"And Sun\r\nWoman called down the wrath of Earthmaker upon him, and with the same\r\nknife he cut her throat.\"\r\n\r\nRedbird fell to her knees sobbing. \"Oh, no more! No more!\" Water Flows\r\nFast and Wild Grape knelt with her and held her, and they wept together.\r\n\r\nRedbird cried until Floating Lily began to wail. Redbird gave her\r\ndaughter the breast and a warmth spread from her baby's sucking lips,\r\nblunting the edge of grief and calming her a little.\r\n\r\nWild Grape said, \"I have seen White Bear.\"\r\n\r\nRedbird's body went rigid. Floating Lily pulled her mouth away from\r\nRedbird's breast and started to cry again.\r\n\r\n\"White Bear? Alive?\"\r\n\r\nWild Grape nodded. \"When the long knives were killing us at the Bad Axe,\r\nhe came. He was the long knife war chief's prisoner. He spoke for the\r\nlong knife chief, told us not to be afraid. But then he saw Sun Woman\r\nlying on the ground with her throat cut. He fell down beside her and\r\nscreamed and tore at his face. The long knives had to hold him. I\r\nthought they might kill him, or he might kill himself. They dragged him\r\naway. I think he is a prisoner right there in that fort.\"\r\n\r\n_Or perhaps he is dead_, Redbird thought bitterly. _Like everyone else._\r\n\r\nIn miserable silence she made a little tent out of her blanket in the\r\nfield by the fort, using sticks Eagle Feather found for her. She and her\r\nchildren huddled under the blanket, the sorrow in her belly like a wolf\r\ninside her trying to gnaw and claw its way out.\r\n\r\nThe thought that White Bear might be on the other side of those walls of\r\nwhite-painted limestone was more than she could stand. She could not\r\nmove or speak. Long knives stood around the edges of the field, watching\r\nthe remnant of the British Band with their cold pale eyes. Redbird\r\nalmost wished one of them would shoot her and end her pain. But then\r\nwhat would her children do? She did not want Eagle Feather and Floating\r\nLily to die.\r\n\r\nLater that day Owl Carver hobbled over to her, followed by a thin-lipped\r\nlong knife with a rifle.\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye, my daughter.\" He looked very old and tired. It was a miracle\r\nthat he had lived through this war. She noticed that he held in his hand\r\nthe owl-decorated medicine bag.\r\n\r\n\"Where are you going, Father?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Winnebago Prophet, Black Hawk and I must go into the fort to meet\r\nthe pale eyes war chiefs. I guess they will shoot us or hang us. I\r\ncannot see the future anymore. Wave tells me that the rest of you are\r\nto walk south to the Rock River. The long knives will keep you at their\r\nfort there till next spring. Then they will let you cross the river to\r\njoin He Who Moves Alertly in Ioway country. Take care of your mother and\r\nyour sister. You are the strongest and wisest of my children.\"\r\n\r\nHe thrust his medicine bag at her.\r\n\r\n\"If I bring this into the fort it may be lost to our people forever. You\r\nare my child. You must be the spirit walker for the British Band.\"\r\n\r\nA golden glow spread through her body. She took the bag from him--it was\r\nvery light in her hands--and held it against her chest. She tried to\r\nspeak, but her throat closed up on her.\r\n\r\nOwl Carver said, \"Remember always, all people, even the pale eyes, are\r\nchildren of Earthmaker. Whatever power Earthmaker gives you, never use\r\nit against another person. If the long knives hurt you, you can ask for\r\nstrength to fight them yourself, but never call on the spirits to attack\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Father.\"\r\n\r\n_Even if they have killed White Bear, I will not use the power of the\r\nspirits against them._\r\n\r\n\"Farewell, my child.\"\r\n\r\nRedbird took Owl Carver's hand. \"If you meet White Bear there in the\r\nfort, tell him I am alive and Eagle Feather and Floating Lily are alive,\r\nand one day we will all be together.\"\r\n\r\nWolf Paw stood beside her, watching Black Hawk, the Winnebago Prophet\r\nand Owl Carver walk into the square of buildings. They were followed by\r\nsix blue-coated long knives pointing rifles at them and by a delegation\r\nof Winnebago chiefs and braves.\r\n\r\nShe clutched the medicine bag tightly.\r\n\r\nHer eyes clouded over. She saw a crowd of pale eyes with distorted\r\nmouths, shouting. Terror seized her, and she tried to cry aloud, but she\r\ncould not. The white faces dissolved, and she saw a mound of earth in a\r\nforest. Atop it was a willow wand with a small strip of red blanket tied\r\nto it. Darkness closed in around her.\r\n\r\nShe felt strong hands gripping her arms. Her sight cleared, and she\r\nrealized that Wolf Paw was holding her.\r\n\r\n\"You were falling,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid,\" she said. \"I have seen death on the trail before us.\"\r\n\r\nWolf Paw looked down at her with earnest eyes. He had aged so much! He\r\nhad untied the red horsehair crest from his head, a wise thing to do,\r\nbecause there were pale eyes who might recognize him as a leading Sauk\r\nbrave and want revenge. He now had only a short, irregular growth of\r\nblack hair on the middle of his scalp and stubble growing around it, but\r\nhe still wore the silver coin around his neck.\r\n\r\nHe said, \"Whatever we must face, you have more courage than any of us. I\r\nhave not forgotten many winters ago when the spirit Bear came to our\r\ncamp. I turned and ran while you stood fast.\"\r\n\r\nShe waved a hand. \"It was only White Bear.\"\r\n\r\n\"We did not know that then. From that day when I ran and you stood, I\r\nhave always wished that a child of mine might possess your courage and\r\nwisdom.\"\r\n\r\nShe remembered how he had pushed her aside the night she stood beside\r\nWhite Bear and warned the tribe against going to war. She remembered the\r\nwoman's dress he had forced on White Bear. But the man she saw before\r\nher was lost and grieving. He had lost his war. He had let his wives and\r\nchildren be killed. He had failed himself. He had nothing left to\r\nbelieve in.\r\n\r\nSo she only said, \"Be as a father to the children I do have. Help me\r\nprotect them.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe sun beat down on her bare head, and the dust of the trail choked\r\nher. This was the Moon of Dry Rivers, the hottest time of summer. Every\r\nstep hurt her heart, because every step took her farther away from that\r\nfort where the long knives might be holding White Bear. Might be. She\r\nhad never been able to find out.\r\n\r\nBy the third day of their trek southward along the Great River, the\r\nsoles of Redbird's moccasins had worn through. She stumbled over ruts\r\ndug in the wide trail by pale eyes' wagon wheels. The sun had baked the\r\npacked dirt of the trail till it was hard as stone.\r\n\r\nWhen the long knives let them stop to rest at midday, she took from her\r\nblanket roll White Bear's knife. With the knife she cut strips away from\r\nher doeskin dress and bound them around her feet. She cut up Eagle\r\nFeather's shirt and wrapped his moccasins so they would last longer.\r\n\r\nA long knife with a thick blond mustache was standing over her with his\r\nhand out.\r\n\r\n\"Give me that. No knives.\"\r\n\r\nHe spoke the pale eyes' tongue, but she knew enough of it to understand.\r\nBut she couldn't give up the knife. It was all she had left of White\r\nBear. Her grip tightened on the deerhorn handle, and she thought she\r\nwould stab the long knife--or herself--before she would let go of it.\r\n\r\nShe tried to tell him that this was precious, that it belonged to her\r\nhusband who was a shaman. But she did not have the American words to say\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nHe just kept saying \"No knives,\" and his face turned a deep red. His\r\nhand rested on the butt of his pistol.\r\n\r\nWolf Paw came over. He took her wrist in a strong grip and took the\r\nknife from her hand and held it out, handle first, to the blue-coat.\r\n\r\nShe understood why Wolf Paw had forced her to give up the knife, but she\r\nwas angry with him.\r\n\r\n\"That was White Bear's knife from his father,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"The long knife would have killed you,\" Wolf Paw said. \"We cannot fight\r\nthem.\" She saw the hopelessness in his eyes, and she put her hand\r\nreassuringly on his arm. When the long knives ordered them to get up and\r\nstart walking, he walked beside her.\r\n\r\nShe was hungry all day long. A food wagon followed the party. Three\r\ntimes a day the soldiers got meat and bread from it, but the Sauk got\r\nonly corn mash on tin plates, which they washed out in the river and\r\nreturned to the food wagon. Several times a day they were allowed to\r\nstop and drink from the river. Redbird prayed that her milk would hold\r\nout for Floating Lily.\r\n\r\nShe sang a walking song, to try to forget her pain and to help her put\r\none aching foot in front of the other.\r\n\r\n    \"We walk this trail, following the deer.\r\n    Sing as you walk, oh, braves and squaws!\r\n    Last night I dreamed my moccasins\r\n    Struck fire as they touched the ground.\"\r\n\r\nWhen she raised her voice others joined in. After a while even Wolf Paw\r\nbegan to sing in a deep voice.\r\n\r\nFive blue-coated long knives rode before the Sauk and another five\r\nbehind them. Redbird looked around at her people, a hundred or so,\r\nmostly women and children. The men numbered about twenty. Tired, hungry,\r\nsick, broken in spirit. All of them on foot now, the last of their\r\nhorses having been taken away at Fort Crawford.\r\n\r\nShe remembered Owl Carver's parting words to her. _You must be the\r\nspirit walker for the British Band._ And Wolf Paw had said that she had\r\nthe courage and wisdom to face death on the trail.\r\n\r\nWhatever this remnant of her people might have to meet now, she promised\r\nherself that she would use all her strength to help them through it.\r\n\r\nThey came to a smaller river, the Fever, that flowed into the Great\r\nRiver. A flatboat to take travelers across was drawn up on shore. The\r\nlong knives had angry words with the men who would pole the flatboat.\r\nRedbird understood that the boatmen would not carry her people. Let them\r\nswim, their gestures said. But the river was too deep and its current\r\ntoo swift for these half-starved, exhausted people.\r\n\r\nWhile the long knives argued with the boatmen, more pale eyes came to\r\nwatch. They must have a town nearby. Redbird felt a chill of fear at the\r\nhatred she saw in their faces. How frightened of the British Band they\r\nmust have been only a moon or two ago. Now they had what was left of the\r\nBritish Band at their mercy.\r\n\r\nThe long knife leader shouted and drew his pistol and waved it. Shaking\r\nhis head, the chief of the boatmen made an angry gesture toward the\r\nflatboat. The long knife took coins from his saddlebag and handed them\r\ndown to the boatman. The long knives began to herd Redbird's people on\r\nboard.\r\n\r\nIt took three trips to carry all of the Sauk across the Fever River. By\r\nthis time hundreds of pale eyes men, women and children had gathered at\r\nthe riverbank.\r\n\r\nRedbird and her children were in the last group to cross. She heard\r\nangry cries. The pale eyes were throwing rotten vegetables, clumps of\r\ndirt and small rocks. She pulled Floating Lily around from her back to\r\nhold her in her arms. A soft tomato hit Redbird in the ear. She heard\r\nlaughter. She wanted to keep both hands on the baby, so she did not wipe\r\naway the pulp and seeds that dripped down her neck. She ran on board the\r\nboat.\r\n\r\nWhen she stumbled off on the other side of the river she was panting,\r\nbreathless with relief. She felt a hand wiping the tomato pulp from her\r\nneck--Wolf Paw. It was good to know he was nearby.\r\n\r\nThe next morning when they set out, Wolf Paw picked up Eagle Feather,\r\nwhose ragged moccasins had fallen from his feet. He lifted him over his\r\nhead and set him on his shoulders. Redbird smiled her thanks, and Wolf\r\nPaw returned a sad look, then sighed and lowered his gaze to the ground.\r\nAll that day he trudged beside her with Eagle Feather on his back. That\r\nnight he slept near Redbird and her children.\r\n\r\nThe following day the trail led past flat fields, mostly planted with\r\ncorn, stretching to the edge of the Great River. For a moment, reminded\r\nof the cornfields around Saukenuk, Redbird's heart lifted. Then she\r\nrecalled that from now on only pale eyes would plant corn in this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nOn her left bluffs rose up, overlooking the river like the statues of\r\nspirits. Ahead she could see many pale eyes lodges built on the side of\r\na hill. At the top of the hill was a fort surrounded by a wall of\r\nupright logs. She saw a dark mass of people spread across the trail\r\nahead.\r\n\r\nThey were not standing to one side, as those at the last town had. They\r\nwere blocking the way.\r\n\r\nShe felt that she knew this place, though she had never been here\r\nbefore. After a moment she understood why. White Bear and Yellow Hair\r\nhad both talked to her many times about the village where White Bear had\r\nlived with his father, Star Arrow. The great lodge they lived in must be\r\nsomewhere beyond that hill. And the walled building at the top of the\r\nhill would be the trading post of White Bear's uncle, the one who had\r\ndriven him away from here and who had tried to kill him at Old Man's\r\nCreek.\r\n\r\nAs she got closer she heard angry voices. Again she took her baby in her\r\narms. She looked around for Wolf Paw and was grateful to see him at her\r\nside. He set Eagle Feather down, and the boy seized her skirt.\r\n\r\nBut if this was the town where White Bear had lived, this was where Wolf\r\nPaw's war party had killed many men, women and children. This was where\r\nthe big gun had fired into Wolf Paw's body the silver coin that still\r\nhung around his neck. What if these people recognized him? She was glad\r\nagain that he had taken off his red crest. The coin, she noticed, had\r\ndisappeared, too, inside his buckskin shirt.\r\n\r\nBut whether they recognized Wolf Paw or not, these people would hate her\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nTerror seized her as she remembered her vision at Fort Crawford--death\r\non the trail. She tried to stop walking, but the people behind her\r\npushed her on. The mounted long knives behind them were driving everyone\r\nforward.\r\n\r\nCloser to the pale eyes standing in the trail, she saw that most of\r\nthose in front were men, and they were holding clubs and rocks. Her legs\r\nturned to water and she felt that she might fall down. She did not have\r\nthe strength to go on, to walk toward the death she had foreseen days\r\nago. Her own people jostled her. The long knives were calling orders,\r\ntrying to make the Sauk move ahead, but nobody wanted to be the first to\r\ncome near that angry crowd.\r\n\r\nThe long knife with the yellow mustache rode ahead and spoke to the\r\ncrowd, waving his hand at them to clear the way. They shouted back at\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe crowd surged forward.\r\n\r\nAnd the blue-coats rode into the fields on either side of the trail.\r\n\r\nShe could not see the villagers, because Wolf Paw had stepped in front\r\nof her.\r\n\r\nEagle Feather's frantic grip was hurting her leg. She hugged Floating\r\nLily tightly in her arms, hoping that if she were felled by a stone, her\r\nbody would protect her baby.\r\n\r\n_They are going to kill all of us._\r\n\r\nThe shouts of the pale eyes battered at her ears. Rocks, many bigger\r\nthan a man's fist, hurtled through the air. Redbird saw women and\r\nchildren falling around her.\r\n\r\nShe heard a thud that made her ears ring, and suddenly Wolf Paw was\r\nslumping to the rutted trail in front of her.\r\n\r\nMen charged at the fallen Wolf Paw with rocks and clubs raised. Eagle\r\nFeather suddenly let go of Redbird and plunged into the crowd of Sauk\r\nbehind her. She watched him disappear as he burrowed in among the legs\r\nof the women and men.\r\n\r\n\"Redbird!\"\r\n\r\nSqueezing Floating Lily against her chest, Redbird looked around\r\nfrantically at the sound of her name.\r\n\r\nAt the edge of the crowd she saw yellow braids and blue eyes and arms\r\nwaving. Yellow Hair, her face twisted with anguish, was trying to force\r\nher way through to her.\r\n\r\nThere were other people with Yellow Hair. A very stout woman was pushing\r\nand pulling at the angry men and women around her, shouting at them to\r\nstop what they were doing. And a man with sandy hair was also fighting\r\nthe other villagers.\r\n\r\n_White Bear had an aunt and uncle in this village._\r\n\r\nBut the crowd pushed forward, and she could no longer see those few who\r\nwere trying to help her people.\r\n\r\nThe men were beating Wolf Paw. One powerful-looking man with broad\r\nshoulders and chest and a thick brown beard lifted a club to bring it\r\ndown on Wolf Paw's head.\r\n\r\nIn the pale eyes' tongue Redbird cried out, \"No! Please!\"\r\n\r\nThe man turned and stared at her, madness in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"You kill my wife!\" he roared. His spittle wet her face. He reached for\r\nher.\r\n\r\nShe screamed and screamed. His hand grabbed at Floating Lily's tiny\r\nbody, and the baby shrieked with pain and terror. Redbird tried to bite\r\nand kick him, to squirm away. He swung his club at her and hit the side\r\nof her head. The blow stunned her, weakening her grip on her baby.\r\n\r\nThe brown-bearded man wrenched Floating Lily from her arms.\r\n\r\nHer screams tore her throat. The man whirled away from her, lifted\r\nFloating Lily high over his head. The crowd enveloped him, and the baby\r\ndisappeared in their midst. Screaming, punching and kicking, she fought\r\nto get at Floating Lily, but people pushed her back and threw her to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nHer voice was gone. She crawled through the stones and the dirt. She saw\r\nthe legs of pale eyes men and the skirts of pale eyes women, and in\r\ntheir midst a small unmoving body, wrapped in a blanket soaked with\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nThe people rushed off in a different direction, and she crawled along\r\nthe trail until she could reach out and take her daughter in her arms.\r\nShe pulled herself into a sitting position, holding the bundle in her\r\nlap. Her hands were wet with blood. She looked down at the tiny crumpled\r\nface, blood running out of the baby mouth. No movement. Arms and legs\r\nlimp. No sound. No breath.\r\n\r\nHer mind went blank. A mantle of blackness covered her eyes.\r\n\r\nWhen she came awake, Yellow Hair was sitting beside her, holding her in\r\nher arms and sobbing. The fat pale eyes woman was standing over both of\r\nthem, tears streaking her face. She was holding a red blanket in her\r\nhands, offering it to Redbird.\r\n\r\nAt the sight of the strange white face Redbird screamed and shrank away,\r\npressing the baby in her arms to her breast. She pulled away from Yellow\r\nHair, who sat on the ground and buried her face in her hands.\r\n\r\nThe fat woman put the blanket on the ground and stumbled away from\r\nRedbird. She got a short distance and began to throw up, coughing and\r\nsobbing. The sandy-haired man went to her and held her.\r\n\r\nRedbird watched the anguish of Yellow Hair and the fat woman numbly. She\r\nhurt too much to have any feeling for anyone else. She understood that\r\nthe woman had given her the blanket to wrap Floating Lily. She hitched\r\nherself over to the blanket and picked it up and wrapped it around the\r\nbloody bundle without looking at it.\r\n\r\nThe bright red of the blanket, she thought, would keep Floating Lily\r\nwarm.\r\n\r\nFrom some distance away the anguished cries of other people reached\r\nRedbird's ears. Others must have been hurt by the pale eyes villagers.\r\n\r\nYellow Hair, still crying so hard she was unable to speak, moved beside\r\nRedbird and put her hand on the blanket.\r\n\r\nThe crowd that had attacked the Sauk were gathered in a field beside the\r\ntrail. The ten long knives on horseback had formed a line and had pushed\r\nthem back. Too late.\r\n\r\nThe fat woman seemed to have forgotten Redbird. She staggered away from\r\nthe Sauk, screaming at the people in the field. It was impossible for\r\nRedbird to understand her words, but her voice was full of rage. Some of\r\nthe people answered back, but in sullen voices Redbird could hardly\r\nhear.\r\n\r\nRedbird could not stand up. She felt no strength at all in her trembling\r\nlegs.\r\n\r\n\"Eagle Feather!\" she cried. She called her son again and again.\r\n\r\nHe came and stood before her. \"Is Floating Lily dead? Did they kill\r\nher?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Redbird.\r\n\r\nEagle Feather began to cry. \"Why did they kill my little sister?\"\r\n\r\nRedbird felt a touch on her shoulder. Wolf Paw's hand. His forehead was\r\ngashed and blood was running down into one eye that was swollen and\r\nshut.\r\n\r\n\"I thought they killed you,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"It would have been good if they had.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she said, \"do not wish that.\"\r\n\r\nRedbird sensed a silence and realized that Yellow Hair was no longer\r\ncrying. She and Wolf Paw were staring at each other.\r\n\r\nNow, thought Redbird, Yellow Hair could have her revenge for her\r\nfather's death, for her own suffering. All she had to do was tell the\r\nvillagers who Wolf Paw was, the leader of the war band that had attacked\r\nVictor. The brave who had kidnapped her. The long knives could\r\nnot--would not--stop the people from killing him on the spot.\r\n\r\nYellow Hair sighed and put her arm around Redbird's shoulders. Perhaps\r\nshe didn't want revenge. Redbird was too sick with grief to wonder much\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\nWolf Paw said, \"Four others are dead, and many more are hurt. We will\r\ncarry our dead away from this place. I think the long knives will let us\r\nbury them farther along this trail.\"\r\n\r\nHolding Floating Lily's body tightly, Redbird let Wolf Paw take her by\r\nthe elbows and lift her to her feet. She felt Yellow Hair's arm still\r\naround her shoulders. She began to cry quietly.\r\n\r\nWolf Paw said, \"Even though you grieve for your baby, the people who are\r\nwounded need your help. Sun Woman taught you, and you were White Bear's\r\nwife and Owl Carver's daughter. You are the only one who knows what to\r\ndo.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have hardly any medicines left,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"You can pray for those who are hurt,\" Wolf Paw said. \"And when we bury\r\nthe dead, you can speak to their spirits for us.\"\r\n\r\n_You must be the spirit walker for the British Band._\r\n\r\nA long knife rode over and spoke to Yellow Hair. Redbird understood that\r\nhe was telling her that she could not stay with the Sauk prisoners.\r\n\r\nIn the way they had learned to talk to each other Yellow Hair told\r\nRedbird that she would have gladly died to save Floating Lily. She\r\npromised to do what she could for the remaining people.\r\n\r\n\"You, me, sisters,\" Redbird said.\r\n\r\nYellow Hair put her arms around Redbird, pressing Floating Lily between\r\nthem. She bent and kissed Redbird on the cheek, her tears wetting\r\nRedbird's face.\r\n\r\nRedbird glanced up at the long knife who had spoken to Yellow Hair. His\r\nmouth under his yellow mustache twisted in scorn.\r\n\r\nYellow Hair began to sob again, and her arms tightened around Redbird.\r\nRedbird felt White Bear's aunt and uncle gently trying to pull Yellow\r\nHair away from her.\r\n\r\nThe mounted long knife shouted angrily. Would they shoot Yellow Hair if\r\nshe didn't leave?\r\n\r\nFrightened for Yellow Hair, Redbird twisted her arms and shoulders and\r\nbroke free from her.\r\n\r\nThe fat woman and the sandy-haired man drew Yellow Hair away. But her\r\nsobs became louder, turned to screams.\r\n\r\n\"My baby!\"\r\n\r\nRedbird knew those pale eyes' words. And it was true, she thought. Had\r\nnot Yellow Hair been in the birthing wickiup with Redbird? Had she not\r\nbeen present for every instant of Floating Lily's early life? Was she\r\nnot also White Bear's wife?\r\n\r\n_She feels the same pain I do._\r\n\r\nYellow Hair's screams died away as White Bear's aunt and uncle half\r\ncarried her away from the trail. Her cries were drowned out by the\r\nshouts of the long knives, ordering the Sauk to get to their feet and\r\nstart walking again.\r\n\r\nAs Redbird, holding Floating Lily, stumbled down the trail she looked at\r\nthe crowd in the field. They were not shouting or throwing rocks now.\r\nThey just stared. Perhaps they were satisfied.\r\n\r\nHer eyes met those of the brown-bearded man who had torn Floating Lily\r\nfrom her arms. He saw her holding her dead daughter, and his face was\r\nstill red and rigid with hatred.\r\n\r\nShe had understood enough of his tongue to understand what he had\r\nshouted at her: _You kill my wife_.\r\n\r\nAt the sight of him she felt heavy as a stone. There was nothing she\r\ncould do that would bring Floating Lily back. Her baby's little feet\r\nwere on the Trail of Souls. Only death would free Redbird from pain.\r\n\r\nWolf Paw, once again carrying Eagle Feather, walked beside her. She\r\nsensed someone walking on her other side and turned to look. She saw a\r\nshrunken, wizened woman with a sad face. It took her a moment to realize\r\nthat it was her mother, Wind Bends Grass.\r\n\r\nMany footsteps later, when their trail passed through woods, the long\r\nknives let them stop. They unstrapped small shovels from their saddles\r\nand gave them to some of the men. The Sauk men dug five deep graves and\r\nplaced the bodies--three women, one man, and a baby--sitting upright in\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWolf Paw dug Floating Lily's grave, letting Eagle Feather do part of the\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nBefore covering Floating Lily with earth, Redbird tore a small strip\r\nfrom the red blanket the fat woman had given her and set it beside the\r\ngrave.\r\n\r\nWhen the five were buried Redbird saw the eyes of all the people turned\r\ntoward her, and she knew they expected her, in spite of the grief that\r\nwas killing her, to complete the rite.\r\n\r\nFirst, she sang.\r\n\r\n    \"In your brown blanket, O Earthmaker,\r\n    Wrap your children and carry them away,\r\n    Fold them again in your body ...\"\r\n\r\nWhen she had finished the song, she spoke to the dead.\r\n\r\n\"You are innocent of wrongdoing,\" she said. \"You have no debt to pay, no\r\npromise to keep. You have kept faith and walked with honor the path that\r\nled to these graves. Do not linger here in hope of avenging yourselves\r\non those who killed you. Great happiness awaits you in the West. The Owl\r\nspirit will show you how to set your feet on the Trail of Souls. Go now,\r\nbegin your journey.\"\r\n\r\nAfter she had spoken, the people broke willow wands from trees growing\r\nby the water and set them upright on the mounds of earth. Redbird took\r\nthe piece of red blanket and tied it to the end of the wand over\r\nFloating Lily's grave.\r\n\r\n_Your path on this earth was a short one, my daughter. But the earth is\r\nnot a good place for our people just now. And many, many of your Sauk\r\nbrothers and sisters will journey with you on the Trail of Souls. Go now\r\ninto the West, and your father and brother and I will one day follow\r\nafter, and we will all be together again._\r\n\r\nAs she stepped back from the grave she remembered how, two days ago, far\r\nto the north, she had seen this grave in her mind and had fainted. With\r\na sinking heart she understood how terrible were the shaman's gifts she\r\nhad longed for all her life.\r\n\r\nThe long knives had sat silently beside the trail, letting their horses\r\ngraze while the people buried their dead. They did not seem worried that\r\nanyone might try to escape. After all, where could a Sauk go in this\r\ncountry? Once they might have walked freely anywhere this side of the\r\nGreat River. Now all who lived in this land hated them.\r\n\r\nRedbird could not tell whether the long knives were ashamed that they\r\nlet these people in their care be killed. Maybe they were pleased, maybe\r\nit did not matter to them. When the people came out of the woods, the\r\nlong knives stood up, silent and expressionless, and mounted their\r\nhorses again for the journey south.\r\n\r\nWolf Paw walked beside Redbird and Eagle Feather. Redbird missed the\r\nfamiliar weight of the baby on her back, and started to weep again. Her\r\nbreasts, filling with milk that would not be sucked, began to ache.\r\n\r\nAfter they had walked a long time in silence, Wolf Paw said, \"I failed\r\nyou, Redbird. You asked me to protect your children. I sent my own wives\r\nand my children to their deaths, and now I did not save your daughter. I\r\nam not a man.\"\r\n\r\nThe pale eyes had not killed Wolf Paw, Redbird thought, but they had\r\nkilled his spirit. She would try to heal him. Nothing would bring back\r\nFloating Lily, but perhaps she could give new life to this man.\r\n\r\nWhen they stopped to sleep that night she lay on her back on the ground\r\nstaring up at the sky, Eagle Feather snuggled close to her, Wolf Paw and\r\nWind Bends Grass nearby.\r\n\r\nA bird appeared on a tree limb overhead.\r\n\r\nEven though it was night, she could somehow see that the bird's plumage\r\nwas a red as bright as the strip of blanket she had left on Floating\r\nLily's grave. Around his eyes was a black mask, and on his head a crest\r\nof red feathers.\r\n\r\nThe bird flew to a more distant tree limb, and she felt that he called\r\nher to follow him. She stood up, and none of the sleeping people noticed\r\nher. She walked past a long knife on guard with a rifle, and he looked\r\nright through her.\r\n\r\nThe bright bird darted into a black opening in the hillside above the\r\nriver, and Redbird followed. In the cave all she could see was the glow\r\nof red wings far ahead of her. There were many twists and turns, and she\r\nwent down very far.\r\n\r\nShe began to see light ahead. It appeared so gradually that her eyes\r\nadjusted to it easily, and when she came to a chamber that was brightly\r\nlit she was neither dazzled nor blinded.\r\n\r\nThe walls of the chamber rose high above her, hard and smooth and clear\r\nas ice, and they glistened with a light that seemed to be everywhere\r\nbehind them. She heard a murmuring and a rustling, and saw in niches cut\r\ninto the wall many kinds of creatures, plants and animals and birds. She\r\nlooked down at fish swimming restlessly in the dark pool that formed\r\nmost of the floor.\r\n\r\nIn the center of the pool was an island, and on the island a huge\r\nancient Turtle squatted on four wrinkled, gray-green legs.\r\n\r\n_Welcome, daughter_, said the Turtle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n22\r\n\r\nRenegade\r\n\r\n\r\nRaoul sat on the edge of his chair in Fort Crawford's assembly room,\r\nwaiting for the guards to bring in Auguste. In a row beside him sat\r\nseven other militia officers, all of whom had been witnesses against the\r\nIndian leaders.\r\n\r\nRaoul discovered all at once that he was trembling with anticipation.\r\n\r\n_Let today be the day_--it was almost a prayer, but he did not know who\r\nwould hear such a prayer--_let them string him up today_.\r\n\r\n_Let me see that damned mongrel die._\r\n\r\nToday the commanders of the army that had defeated Black Hawk would tell\r\nthe Sauk and Fox leaders their fate. The less important Indians were to\r\nbe dealt with first, so Auguste would be coming in now.\r\n\r\nRaoul watched avidly as Auguste walked in between two privates, his\r\nwrists handcuffed, carrying an iron ball at the end of a chain attached\r\nto his ankles. The sight of the mongrel in chains was more satisfying\r\nthan a good swig of Old Kaintuck.\r\n\r\nRaoul had not seen Auguste since the day they had faced each other too\r\nbriefly on that bloody island off the mouth of the Bad Axe. Again Raoul\r\nsaw that Auguste's right ear, partly covered by his long black locks,\r\nwas split into upper and lower halves, with a red, partly healed gap\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\n_Eli's bullet must have gone through his ear instead of his head. And,\r\nknowing Eli, that was no accident. That was why he said I'd find a\r\nsurprise up in Michigan Territory._\r\n\r\nRaoul's fingers worked in his lap. That gap-toothed old bastard had\r\ndeliberately lied to him about killing Auguste. Why? What could he gain\r\nby keeping Auguste alive?\r\n\r\nAuguste's dark eyes widened as they met Raoul's, and from across the\r\nroom his hatred struck Raoul like a blow. Raoul remembered the woman\r\nwhose throat he had cut.\r\n\r\n_His mother. But killing her was still not enough to pay me back for\r\nClarissa and Phil and Andy. For the burning of Victoire._\r\n\r\nAuguste turned his back to Raoul and faced the three commanders, who sat\r\nat a long table behind which a big American flag was nailed to the\r\nplaster wall.\r\n\r\nIn the center was Major General Winfield Scott, finally arrived from the\r\nEast to take charge of what was left of the war. Raoul hoped Scott had\r\ncome out here with President Jackson's orders to send this pack of\r\nsavages to the gallows. The general had listened intently to everything\r\nRaoul had to say against the mongrel. Raoul distrusted Scott's fancy\r\nuniform, his heavy gold-braided epaulets and the white plume on the\r\ncocked hat that lay beside him. But Scott's features were severe, his\r\nbrows straight and black, his nose sharp and his mouth tight. Raoul saw\r\nno pity in the look he bent on Auguste.\r\n\r\nFlanking Scott were Colonel Zachary Taylor and white-bearded Brigadier\r\nGeneral Henry Atkinson, who had commanded the militia and troops right\r\nup to the battle at the Bad Axe.\r\n\r\nWinfield Scott glanced at a paper before him and said, \"Auguste de\r\nMarion, by some also called White Bear, you are named in Colonel\r\nTaylor's report as one of the ringleaders of Black Hawk's uprising. We\r\nhave heard testimony that you are a renegade and murderer.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste glanced at Raoul and then said, \"Have I the right to hear what\r\nhas been said against me?\"\r\n\r\nScott shook his head. \"This is only a hearing, not a court-martial. What\r\ndo you have to say for yourself?\"\r\n\r\n\"I advised my people to keep the peace,\" Auguste said. \"And the British\r\nBand did not take my advice. So I am not much of a ringleader. And I\r\nnever killed anyone, so I am no murderer. As for being a renegade, I was\r\nborn a Sauk. I'm no more a renegade than any other member of my tribe\r\nwho followed Black Hawk.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste's voice rang loud and clear. Raoul noticed that his speech\r\nseemed more accented than he remembered it. Probably from living with\r\nIndians and talking only their talk for nearly a year.\r\n\r\n_Is it only a year since I drove him from Victoire? Seems a whole\r\nlifetime away._\r\n\r\nScott cast sideways glances at Taylor and Atkinson.\r\n\r\n\"We are told you are an American citizen,\" said Zachary Taylor.\r\n\r\nAuguste said, \"Sir, my father was Pierre de Marion, an American citizen,\r\nand because it was his wish, I lived as a white man for six years. But\r\nmy mother was Sun Woman of the Sauk tribe, and I remained a Sauk in my\r\nheart.\"\r\n\r\nScott said, \"Your heart doesn't matter to the law. What was your conduct\r\nduring the war?\"\r\n\r\nRaoul listened, blood hammering in his skull, to Auguste's account of\r\nOld Man's Creek. Auguste named him, turned and pointed to him.\r\n\r\n\"Then he came toward me to shoot me. I ran into the tall grass. Eli\r\nGreenglove, one of his men, shot me.\" He touched his mangled ear. \"It\r\nwas dark and the men were drunk, and I was able to stay alive by\r\npretending to be dead. When Black Hawk found out that his emissaries had\r\nbeen shot, he believed he had no choice but to go on fighting. It was\r\nonly then that the British Band began to attack whites.\"\r\n\r\nAnger drove Raoul to his feet. \"Sir, I must answer that.\"\r\n\r\nScott turned hard blue eyes on Raoul. \"That won't be necessary, Colonel.\r\nI've already had a complete report of what happened at Old Man's Creek.\"\r\nRaoul heard a faint disdain in Scott's elegant Virginia drawl and felt\r\nhis face turn hot.\r\n\r\nScott consulted in a murmur with Taylor and Atkinson. Raoul sat down\r\nslowly and drummed his fingers on his knee. He looked up to see Auguste\r\nstaring stonily at him, his manacled hands clenched into fists. Raoul\r\nmade himself hold Auguste's gaze.\r\n\r\n_Shaman. I wonder if he does have any power to hurt me._\r\n\r\n_Nonsense._\r\n\r\n_But what is he thinking, what is he planning?_\r\n\r\nScott said, \"We've read depositions from Miss Hale and the boy Woodrow\r\nPrewitt stating that Auguste and his squaw protected them and cared for\r\nthem while they were captives of the Sauk and that Auguste eventually\r\nled them to safety.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul clenched his jaw and his breath steamed out of his nostrils. He\r\nwished he could give Nancy Hale the back of his hand across her stuck-up\r\nface. The redskins had murdered her father. They'd kidnapped her.\r\nProbably they'd raped her, though she'd never admit it. How in hell\r\ncould she defend this mongrel?\r\n\r\nScott said, \"It seems to me we have no evidence that this man did any\r\nharm to the United States or to any of our citizens. However, there are\r\nserious accusations against him, such as the charge that he instigated\r\nthe Sauk raid on Victor. If he is not legally an Indian, which this\r\nboard of inquiry is not competent to determine, then any acts of war he\r\nparticipated in were crimes against the people of Illinois. His guilt or\r\ninnocence must then be a matter for a civilian court to decide. And the\r\nappropriate place would be the county where he lived with his father,\r\nwhere there would be records and witnesses.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul could hardly hold himself back from jumping up and shouting in\r\ntriumph. He forced himself to look anywhere but at Auguste, knowing that\r\nwhat he felt would be all too easy for the others to read.\r\n\r\n\"You may as well hang me yourself, General,\" Auguste said quietly,\r\npointing at Raoul. \"_He_ runs that whole county. No witnesses will dare\r\nto come forward for me, and he's had all my records destroyed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Without records, nothing can be proved _against_ you,\" said Scott.\r\n\r\nRaoul felt a hollow open in his stomach. What the hell had Burke Russell\r\ndone with Auguste's adoption records and Pierre's will? The damned\r\nIndians had killed Russell. And that pretty wife of his just refused to\r\nspeak to Raoul.\r\n\r\nAuguste said, \"But, sir, I don't believe there's even a court in Smith\r\nCounty to try me.\"\r\n\r\nZachary Taylor shuffled some papers. \"Yes, there is. Smith County had a\r\nspecial election a month after that bad Indian raid. Elected county\r\ncommissioners, and a man named Cooper is judge of the circuit court. I\r\nthink we can guarantee White Bear, or Auguste de Marion, a proper\r\ntrial.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul clenched his fists. Things had gone sour in Smith County while he\r\nwas off fighting the Sauk.\r\n\r\nGeneral Atkinson said, \"I don't know about that. Seventeen men, women\r\nand children were killed in that raid. Sending this man to stand trial\r\nthere could be simply condemning him to death by Lynch's law.\"\r\n\r\n_I wish it could be that simple._ Remembering the cool reception he'd\r\ngotten in Victor when he went there to outfit the _Victory_ for the war,\r\nRaoul began to have second thoughts about whether things would go his\r\nway.\r\n\r\n_I'll have to get my Smith County boys together and make sure Cooper\r\nruns that trial right._\r\n\r\nRaoul stole a glance at Auguste and saw that his face was set in that\r\nhard, expressionless mold Indians took on when they didn't want to show\r\nwhat they were feeling.\r\n\r\nScott said, \"Send a good officer and a couple of men to Victor to escort\r\nthis man and insure a fair trial.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right, sir,\" said Zachary Taylor, making a note. \"Lieutenant Jefferson\r\nDavis and two enlisted men will go along with him.\"\r\n\r\n_Damn!_ Taylor had jumped at the chance to send Lieutenant Davis away\r\nfrom the fort, Raoul thought with annoyance. The gossip around Fort\r\nCrawford was that Davis was courting Taylor's pretty daughter, and\r\nTaylor didn't approve.\r\n\r\nScott turned his gaze on Raoul. \"And you, Colonel de Marion. By all\r\naccounts you're a very prominent citizen in that community. It's obvious\r\nthere's bad blood between you and your nephew. I'll hold you responsible\r\nif there's any violence against him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Understood, sir,\" said Raoul, calmly enough, but hating to hear the\r\nmongrel called his nephew. Scott's threat was empty; once the general\r\nwas back East he wouldn't care about the fate of one half-breed out on\r\nthe frontier.\r\n\r\nScott turned to Auguste with a small smile. \"While you are on trial,\r\nI'll be negotiating a treaty with the Sauk. And after that, if they\r\ndon't hang you, I think President Jackson would be most interested in\r\nmeeting you.\"\r\n\r\nA treaty? A meeting with Jackson? Raoul quivered with anger and could\r\nbarely keep himself from letting out a shout. Did that mean Scott wasn't\r\ngoing to hang Black Hawk and the rest of them? Was he taking the Sauk\r\nleaders to meet the President?\r\n\r\n_Well, if he does, the mongrel won't be with them_, Raoul thought,\r\ncomforting himself with the picture of a hempen rope around Auguste's\r\nneck.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_My baby!_\r\n\r\nAuguste felt as heavy as if he had turned to stone. He sat hunched over\r\non the plank bed covered with a corn-husk mattress, in his cell in\r\nVictor's village hall, clutching his stomach as tears ran from his eyes.\r\n\r\nAfter what Frank Hopkins had just told him, he no longer cared what\r\nhappened to him here in Victor. These people had killed Floating Lily.\r\nLet them kill him too. He did not want to live in a world that had\r\nkilled his baby daughter.\r\n\r\nHe felt a comforting hand on his shoulder. He glanced at it and saw\r\nFrank's ink-blackened fingers pressing into the blue calico shirt his\r\ncaptors at Fort Crawford had given him.\r\n\r\nHe looked up to see lawyer Thomas Ford's sad eyes on him, but kindly\r\ngestures and looks meant nothing to him now. How could people tear a\r\nbaby girl from her mother's arms and beat her to death?\r\n\r\n_But the Sauk war parties killed children too. All people are cruel,\r\nwhite and red._\r\n\r\n\"I would be better off on the Trail of Souls,\" he said in a low voice.\r\n\r\n_My mother and my daughter, Sun Woman and Floating Lily, both dead._\r\n\r\n\"Nancy and Nicole and I tried to stop them,\" Frank said, his eyes moist,\r\n\"but the crowd was too big. We couldn't get through until it was too\r\nlate. Nancy told us the baby was your daughter. Nicole and Nancy tried\r\nas best they could to comfort your wife.\"\r\n\r\nFor all he knew, Redbird might think him dead. He had asked his guards\r\nat Fort Crawford to pass word to her that he was alive, but he had no\r\nidea whether any of his messages had reached her.\r\n\r\nFord, the lawyer from Vandalia Frank had hired to defend Auguste, said,\r\n\"What happened shows how angry the people of Victor still are against\r\nthe Sauk. I still think we have to ask for a change of venue.\" Ford was\r\na short, slender man with a round face and bright, intelligent eyes.\r\nLeaning against the rough-hewn log wall of Auguste's cell, he wore a\r\ndark brown frock coat with a high collar that came up to his ears.\r\n\r\nFrank said, \"Many people here feel terribly sorry for Auguste. And a lot\r\nof us decided, after we survived the siege, that we wouldn't put up\r\nanymore with the lawlessness that Raoul and his crew represent.\"\r\n\r\n_But Raoul is back now_, Auguste thought. _He'll start to take control\r\nagain._\r\n\r\nFord said, \"Well, Auguste ought to tell us what he thinks. It's his\r\nneck.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste took a deep breath. The clean smell of fresh-cut wood filled his\r\nnostrils. A good smell, but it reminded him that this village hall was\r\nonly recently rebuilt, that last June Wolf Paw's raiding party had\r\nburned down everything in Victor except Raoul's trading post. How could\r\nhe possibly get a fair trial here?\r\n\r\nAuguste said, \"At least here I have some people who know me and care\r\nabout me.\"\r\n\r\nFord sighed. \"So be it. Frank, I want a list of every man who was in the\r\nmob that attacked the Sauk prisoners. We don't want any of them sitting\r\non the jury.\"\r\n\r\nAs Frank and Ford discussed trial tactics, Auguste gazed around at this\r\ndark little chamber on the second floor of the village hall. It might be\r\nhis last home on earth. The only window was a square barred hole high up\r\non the south wall, too small to let much light in--or for a man to climb\r\nout through. This morning a light rain falling outside spattered through\r\nthe window, and the cell felt damp and cool.\r\n\r\n_When Frank built this cell, he could never have thought his own nephew\r\nwould be a prisoner in it._\r\n\r\n\"We have a power of work to do, Auguste,\" Ford interrupted his thoughts.\r\n\"So far I can't find anyone who confirms your story of what happened at\r\nOld Man's Creek. This Otto Wegner fellow whose life you saved, he and\r\nhis family have moved down to the Texas country in Mexico.\"\r\n\r\nFrank said, \"We do have two people who'll testify that you protected\r\nthem and never went on any war parties while they were prisoners of the\r\nBritish Band--Miss Hale and the boy Woodrow.\"\r\n\r\nAt the mention of Nancy's name Auguste felt a wrench in his heart. He\r\nknew that she had stayed in Victor, teaching in a new schoolhouse Frank\r\nhad built for her on the site of her father's church. Her absence in the\r\nweek he had been here had hurt him deeply.\r\n\r\n\"Frank,\" he said, \"why hasn't Nancy come to see me?\"\r\n\r\nThomas Ford said, \"Miss Hale is a very bright young lady, and instead of\r\nrushing down here to visit you when you arrived, she waited till I got\r\nhere and then she asked me what she should do. I told her that there\r\nmust not be even a breath of a suggestion that there was anything\r\nbetween you two. If people believed she had, ah, been intimate with you,\r\nthey'd consider her a loose woman--doubly so because you're an\r\nIndian--and they wouldn't listen to a word she said.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand,\" Auguste said, feeling bitter, but also feeling that the\r\nload of grief he'd borne since arriving at Victor had lightened a\r\nlittle. Nancy had not forgotten him, as he'd feared she might after she\r\ngot back among whites. He felt shame that he had even imagined she might\r\nturn against him. And when the trial started, at least he would see her\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe smell of fresh-cut wood pervaded the courtroom on the first floor of\r\nthe village hall, as it did Auguste's cell. Frank must have worked seven\r\ndays a week since last June, Auguste thought. Even though he'd hired\r\nhalf a dozen assistants, it was a wonder he'd found time to write and\r\npublish his newspaper.\r\n\r\nJudge David Cooper, a man with a square, muscular face and piercing blue\r\neyes, sat at a long table with the flags of the United States and the\r\nstate of Illinois on stands behind him. A carpenter's mallet lay on the\r\ntable. Probably borrowed from Frank, Auguste thought. He had a vague\r\nmemory of Cooper's being present and saying something to Raoul the day\r\nhe'd been driven from Victoire. Auguste stood as Cooper read out the\r\ncharge of complicity in the murder of 223 citizens of the state of\r\nIllinois by the British Band of the Sauk and Fox Indian tribes.\r\n\r\nBehind Auguste sat three blue-coats, Lieutenant Jefferson Davis and his\r\ntwo corporals. The prosecutor, Justus Bennett, and his assistant\r\noccupied a third table. The courtroom being not quite finished, the\r\ntwelve jurymen sat on one side of the room in two pews carried over from\r\nthe Presbyterian church.\r\n\r\nAuguste knew only three of the jurors--Robert McAllister, a farmer whose\r\nfamily had survived Wolf Paw's raid by hiding in their root cellar; Tom\r\nSlattery, the blacksmith; and Jean-Paul Kobell, a stableman from\r\nVictoire. He had no reason to think any of those three bore him any\r\nspecial ill will, though they might have good reason to hate any Sauk.\r\nThe others he knew not at all, which meant they must have moved to\r\nVictor since he left.\r\n\r\nBehind the trial participants about fifty citizens of Smith County were\r\ncrowded into the courtroom, sitting in chairs or on benches they had\r\ncarried into the village hall themselves. More stood along the walls.\r\n\r\nDuring the first hour of the trial Raoul de Marion, the first witness\r\nfor the prosecution, testified. He lounged in a chair beside the judge's\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nAuguste sat in a cold fury as he heard, for the first time, an account\r\nof the war between the British Band and the people of Illinois as many\r\npale eyes must have seen it. A murdering band of savages had invaded the\r\nstate. The brave volunteers had pursued them, endured the loss of\r\ncomrades, but eventually had triumphed, administering a righteous\r\nretaliation by exterminating most of the invaders.\r\n\r\nBennett, a lean man whose rounded shoulders gave him a serpentine look,\r\nturned to Thomas Ford. \"Your witness, sir.\"\r\n\r\nFord, very erect in contrast to Bennett, stood up and walked toward\r\nRaoul. \"Mr. de Marion, why on the night of September fifteenth, 1831,\r\ndid you offer a reward of fifty pieces of eight to anyone who would kill\r\nyour nephew, Auguste de Marion?\"\r\n\r\n\"Objection,\" Bennett called from his seat. \"This has nothing to do with\r\nthe defendant's conduct in the Black Hawk War.\"\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary Your Honor,\" said Ford. \"It explains how my client got\r\ninvolved in the war.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll allow it,\" said David Cooper.\r\n\r\nAfter Ford repeated his question, Raoul said, \"I don't remember offering\r\nany reward.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can produce at least ten witnesses who heard you and saw you hold up\r\na money bag.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, he provoked me. He'd tried to cheat me out of my inheritance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Apparently you'd already got control of the estate. By force of arms.\r\nWas it necessary to go on and incite men to kill him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I figured he might do just what he did--stir up the Sauk against us and\r\ntry to use them to take the land away from me.\"\r\n\r\nFord turned to the jury, and the spectators could see the incredulous\r\nlook on his face. Auguste felt a warmth for Ford. He seemed to know what\r\nhe was doing. But it still made him uneasy to know that his life was in\r\nthe hands of another man, no matter how competent.\r\n\r\n\"And why were you going to shoot Auguste, when he came to you with a\r\nwhite flag at Old Man's Creek?\"\r\n\r\n\"He was trying to lead us into an ambush.\"\r\n\r\nFord sighed, clasped his hands behind his back and took a few paces away\r\nfrom Raoul. He threw an exasperated look at the jury, as if to say,\r\n_What can I do with this man?_\r\n\r\nThen he turned suddenly and said, \"Mr. de Marion, in 1812, when you were\r\njust a boy, were you not present at the incident known as the Fort\r\nDearborn Massacre?\"\r\n\r\n\"Objection,\" said Bennett. \"This certainly has nothing to do with the\r\nman who's on trial.\"\r\n\r\n\"Goes to the character of the witness, Your Honor,\" said Ford.\r\n\r\n\"I'll let you ask the question,\" said Cooper. \"Please answer, Mr. de\r\nMarion.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul hunched over and his face grew darker. \"God knows I was at Fort\r\nDearborn.\"\r\n\r\n\"And did you not see your sister horribly murdered by Indians. Were you\r\nnot subjected to two years of captivity and slavery?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did. I was.\" The words came out in a hoarse whisper.\r\n\r\nFord said, \"Mr. de Marion, after those terrible boyhood experiences, to\r\nhave your brother attempt to bring an Indian into the family must have\r\nseemed the crowning insult. I put it to you that your accusations\r\nagainst Auguste stem, not from any misdeeds of his, but from your hatred\r\nfor him because he is an Indian.\"\r\n\r\nJustus Bennett was on his feet. \"Objection. The honorable defense\r\nattorney isn't asking questions. He's making a speech defaming the\r\nwitness.\"\r\n\r\nCooper nodded. \"Sustained.\" He turned to the jury and said, \"The jury\r\nwill forget about everything they just heard the defense attorney say.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste shook his head. How could any man forget something he had just\r\nso clearly heard? In all his years of living among the pale eyes, he had\r\nnever attended a trial. Now, on trial for his own life, he saw that the\r\nways of the pale eyes were even stranger than he had ever realized.\r\n\r\nThe next prosecution witness was Armand Perrault.\r\n\r\nAt the sight of Armand, Auguste broke out in a cold sweat of fury. This\r\nman, Frank had said, was the one who snatched Floating Lily from\r\nRedbird's arms. Walking up to the witness chair, Armand avoided\r\nAuguste's eyes. Always before he had shot Auguste looks of hatred. Today\r\nhe was showing his guilt.\r\n\r\nAching knots spread through all Auguste's muscles. Were he alone with\r\nArmand, he would hurl himself at him and try to kill him, barehanded.\r\nBut in this crowded courtroom he was helpless. His hands tightened on\r\nthe links of his chain till they hurt.\r\n\r\nHe felt a firm grip on his forearm; Ford, sitting beside him, letting\r\nhim know that he sensed his pain.\r\n\r\nLed by Bennett's questions, Armand repeated Raoul's claim that the three\r\npeace messengers were actually the vanguard of a Sauk attack.\r\n\r\n\"Why do they keep harping on this?\" Auguste asked Ford in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\"Makes you out a murderer,\" Ford said out of the side of his mouth, \"if\r\nyou tried to lead the white militiamen into a trap at Old Man's Creek.\"\r\n\r\nWhen it was Ford's turn to question Armand he said, \"You pulled the\r\ntrigger on one of Black Hawk's peace messengers, didn't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Armand, his teeth gleaming in his brown beard. \"And I did\r\nnot miss.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you killed an Indian baby on the road going through town about\r\nthree weeks ago, didn't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't remember.\"\r\n\r\nFord raised his hands toward the beamed ceiling. \"Come now, Mr.\r\nPerrault. A hundred or more people saw you drag that child from its\r\nmother's arms.\"\r\n\r\n\"These were the same Indians who came here and murdered my wife,\r\nMonsieur Légiste.\"\r\n\r\n\"That baby probably wasn't even born when your wife was murdered, Mr.\r\nPerrault.\"\r\n\r\n_If I ever get free I'll kill you, Perrault. By the White Bear spirit I\r\nswear it._\r\n\r\nA chill came over Auguste at his own thought. He recalled Owl Carver's\r\nwarning against trying to turn the power of the spirits against any\r\nother human being. Terrible consequences lay in store for the shaman who\r\ndid so.\r\n\r\n_I'm probably going to be hanged as it is. What else can happen to me?_\r\n\r\nAuguste heard Raoul's voice from somewhere behind him, among the\r\nspectators. \"Hey, Bennett! Aren't you going to say anything? What's this\r\ngot to do with the mongrel?\"\r\n\r\n\"Order!\" Cooper rapped on his table with a carpenter's mallet.\r\n\r\nBennett stood up a little uncertainly. \"If it please your honor, I\r\ncalled Mr. Perrault to testify about what happened at Old Man's Creek. I\r\ndon't see why counsel for the defense is bringing up this other\r\nincident.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, Your Honor,\" said Ford. \"I have no more questions for this\r\nbaby killer.\" Auguste saw sudden pallor in the part of Armand's face not\r\ncovered by his beard.\r\n\r\n\"Objection!\" shouted Bennett.\r\n\r\nFord looked pained. \"What in Heaven's name is wrong with calling a spade\r\na spade?\"\r\n\r\nCooper said, \"Well, try to keep your language a little more elevated,\r\nMr. Ford.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, Your Honor. I have no more questions for this infanticide.\"\r\n\r\nAs Ford turned away to sit down, Auguste saw a quick little smile crease\r\nJudge Cooper's face, then disappear. He began to feel hope stirring in a\r\nheart that had been heavy ever since he came to Victor. This trial would\r\nnot be conducted according to Lynch's law.\r\n\r\nBut he still burned with hatred for Armand Perrault. He turned to watch\r\nPerrault go back to his seat.\r\n\r\nAnd his skin tingled. Just past the gaunt-faced Lieutenant Davis, Nancy\r\nwas sitting, only two rows of chairs away. Her deep blue eyes widened as\r\nshe looked at him. Her smile was, as Cooper's had been, just a brief\r\nshadow, but her face flushed, and she shook her head almost\r\nimperceptibly.\r\n\r\nAuguste understood. As Ford had said, if Nancy were to testify in his\r\nbehalf, people must never know what they had been to each other. All\r\ntheir hatred for red men would come boiling up, and they would hang him\r\nfor having intercourse with a white woman, if for nothing else. He\r\nnodded ever so slightly, tore his eyes away from hers.\r\n\r\nWoodrow was sitting beside Nancy, holding her hand. He had no need to\r\nhide his feelings, and gave Auguste a big grin. Auguste smiled back at\r\nhim, but at the sight of Woodrow, longing for Eagle Feather was a knife\r\nin his heart.\r\n\r\n_I don't even know whether Eagle Feather is alive._\r\n\r\nAnd grief for poor little Floating Lily crushed him.\r\n\r\nThere were Frank and Nicole sitting together, with one of their smaller\r\nchildren--Patrick, Auguste thought--squirming on Nicole's lap. The sight\r\nof the baby made him want to weep.\r\n\r\nThere were Elysée and Guichard, two old men sitting side by side.\r\nGrandpapa had a home of his own now, he'd told Auguste while visiting\r\nhim, a small frame house on a hillside north of town, also built by\r\nFrank. And a young doctor named Surrey who had just moved into the\r\ncounty looked in on Elysée regularly.\r\n\r\n_Good that they have a new doctor here._\r\n\r\nToo bad, though, Gram Medill had died. Of an infection, Auguste had\r\nheard, that she'd refused to let Dr. Surrey treat.\r\n\r\nAuguste saw many more spectators whom he did not recognize, people who\r\nstared back at him with hostility or--at best--curiosity.\r\n\r\nA handsome young woman wearing a black bonnet and a black dress caught\r\nhis eye. There was a strange intensity in her look, but her mouth was\r\ndrawn tight, and he could not tell whether she felt hatred or sympathy\r\nfor him. Then he remembered who she was--Pamela Russell, widow of the\r\ntown clerk whose brains had been dashed out by a Sauk war club during\r\nthe attack on Victor. Nicole, on one of her visits to the village hall,\r\nhad described Russell's death to him and told him how Pamela had\r\ninsisted on touching off the cannon that broke the war party's attack.\r\n\r\n_She will probably want to be the one to put the rope around my neck._\r\n\r\nThe prosecutor called Levi Pope to the stand. The shambling backwoodsman\r\nheld his coonskin cap in his hand as he approached the witness chair.\r\nThis was the first time Auguste could remember seeing him without a\r\nrifle. Its absence made him look strange.\r\n\r\nBennett led Levi Pope through an account of Old Man's Creek. Then Thomas\r\nFord rose to question him.\r\n\r\n\"All right, Levi. When the three Indians, including Auguste, came into\r\nyour camp with the peace flag, how'd you know it was treachery?\"\r\n\r\nLevi frowned and shook his head. \"Well, when we seen that the woods was\r\nfull of Injuns.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, we've heard many times during this trial that 'the woods was full\r\nof Injuns.' How many Indians did you see?\"\r\n\r\n\"'Twasn't me that saw them. It was the scouts Colonel Raoul sent out.\"\r\n\r\n\"So you didn't see any sign yourself that the Indians were trying to\r\nlead you into some kind of trap?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well--no, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"And when you rode into the forest on the north side of Old Man's Creek,\r\ndid you see any Indians?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir. They must of all run off by that time.\"\r\n\r\n\"When did you first meet up with Indians?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, we rode maybe an hour up along the river. It was full dark then,\r\nand they come down off a hill in front of us, a-yelling and screaming.\"\r\n\r\n\"A frontal attack, then. If the Indians were planning to ambush you,\r\nwhat did they gain by sending three men into your camp claiming they\r\nwanted to talk surrender?\"\r\n\r\nLevi Pope's face seemed to elongate as he contemplated Ford's question.\r\n\"I don't rightly know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think the Indians are stupid, Mr. Pope?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, they was stupid to start this war.\" Levi grinned at Ford, looking\r\npleased with himself. Auguste heard some appreciative chuckles from the\r\nspectators. He turned and saw Levi Pope's wife, a skinny, pale woman,\r\nfrowning at her husband as if his testimony made her angry.\r\n\r\nFord nodded and held off on making his reply while he paced the open\r\nspace before the judge's table and let his calm gaze travel over all the\r\nspectators and jurymen. He waited until the hall was quiet.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe the Indians thought it was a stupid war, too, Mr. Pope. Maybe\r\nthat is the real reason Black Hawk sent those three braves to your\r\ncamp.\"\r\n\r\n\"Objection,\" called Bennett. \"Mr. Ford is just speculating.\"\r\n\r\nFord said, \"Your Honor, the claim by Colonel de Marion and others that\r\nthe Indian attempt to make peace, in which Auguste de Marion\r\nparticipated, was some kind of dastardly trick is, itself, merely\r\nspeculation.\"\r\n\r\nJudge Cooper grunted. \"Well, let's stick to what people know, not what\r\nthey think they know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fine with me, Your Honor,\" said Ford, \"as long as the prosecution is\r\nheld to the same standard.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste's belly tightened as he heard Ford speak sharply to the judge.\r\nHe'd seen some hope in Cooper. He didn't want him antagonized. Then he\r\nslumped, letting his manacled hands dangle. What difference? He didn't\r\nhave a chance anyway.\r\n\r\nFord went back to his seat, smiling grimly at Auguste, and Levi Pope,\r\nlooking somewhat puzzled, slouched back to his place among the\r\nspectators. Judge Cooper declared that proceedings were over for the day\r\nand that the defense would call its witnesses tomorrow.\r\n\r\nHopelessly, Auguste stood up and bent over to pick up the iron ball\r\nchained to his leg. Perhaps, he thought, Lynch's law would be better. At\r\nleast it would not prolong his suffering, make him relive moment by\r\nmoment everything he and those he loved had suffered over the past year.\r\nAnd sooner or later he was bound to end up in the same place--a grave.\r\n\r\nThe following day Nicole was sitting in the witness chair, answering\r\nFord's questions in a soft, melodious voice.\r\n\r\nFord asked, \"Do you agree, Mrs. Hopkins, with your brother's charge that\r\nAuguste is a renegade and murderer?\"\r\n\r\nNicole's full face reddened with anger. \"My God, no! Auguste never\r\nturned against us. He left Smith County because Raoul would have had him\r\nmurdered if he'd stayed. Auguste has never harmed anyone.\"\r\n\r\nFord's next witness was Mrs. Pamela Russell. Hearing the spectators\r\nmurmuring questions to one another after Ford called her name, Auguste\r\nwondered anxiously what a woman whose husband had been killed by Wolf\r\nPaw's raid on Victor could possibly say that would help him. Her black\r\ndress and bonnet made her face look even paler. She clutched a black\r\nleather bag in her lap.\r\n\r\nFord said, \"Mrs. Russell, did your late husband entrust any papers to\r\nyou concerning Auguste de Marion?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not exactly, but he kept such papers in our house and told me about\r\nthem. I kept them safe after he died.\"\r\n\r\n\"What were they?\"\r\n\r\n\"A certificate of adoption and a will.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why did he keep them in your home instead of in the village hall?\"\r\n\r\nPamela Russell's dark eyes flashed as she searched the courtroom,\r\nlooking, Auguste suspected, for Raoul.\r\n\r\n\"Raoul de Marion, who never let my husband forget that he owed his job\r\nto him, ordered Burke to destroy both papers.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a lie!\" came Raoul's shout from the back of the hall.\r\n\r\nJustus Bennett looked toward Raoul and said, \"Colonel de Marion, please.\r\nWhat this woman is saying might even help our case.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" Raoul called. \"But you watch what you're doing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, Mrs. Russell--\" Ford began again.\r\n\r\n\"Burke knew that what he told him to do was wrong. So, instead of\r\ndestroying the adoption certificate and the will, he brought them home\r\nand kept them in his strongbox in our cellar. When the Indians burned\r\nour house, the papers survived.\" She paused, gazing over Ford's head.\r\n\"The papers survived.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you have them now, Mrs. Russell?\"\r\n\r\nShe unbuckled the strap that closed the leather bag in her lap and drew\r\nout two folded pieces of paper. She handed them to Ford, who unfolded\r\nthem with a flourish and turned to the judge.\r\n\r\nFord asked, \"Your Honor, may I read these documents to the court?\"\r\n\r\n\"Go right ahead,\" said Judge Cooper.\r\n\r\n\"First, the certificate of adoption,\" said Ford.\r\n\r\nAuguste felt a hard lump rise to block his throat as Ford read the\r\nstatement that Pierre de Marion, on the sixteenth day of August, 1825,\r\ndid declare his natural son, hereafter to be known as Auguste de Marion,\r\nto be his lawful son, granting him all rights and privileges to which\r\nthat status might entitle him.\r\n\r\nAuguste covered his burning eyes with his hand.\r\n\r\n_I meant so much to him._\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Ford, \"the will: 'I, Pierre de Marion, residing on the\r\nestate called Victoire, in the County of Smith and State of Illinois,\r\nmake this my will and revoke all prior wills and codicils.'\"\r\n\r\nIt was the will Auguste had fought against until Pierre had finally\r\npersuaded him to smoke the calumet; the will giving the château and the\r\nland to Auguste. There were also monetary gifts to a number of servants,\r\nincluding one of two hundred dollars to Armand and Marchette Perrault.\r\nAuguste heard an angry-bee buzzing among the spectators. By seizing the\r\nestate, and concealing the will, Raoul had wiped out these gifts. He'd\r\nhave to face some angry servants today, Auguste thought with\r\nsatisfaction. Including that swine Perrault.\r\n\r\n\"The prosecution will want to see those papers,\" said Bennett when Ford\r\nhad finished reading.\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" said Cooper. \"You may have a look any time. In my\r\npresence.\"\r\n\r\nAfter Ford had given the jurors the two papers to look at and had\r\nreturned them to Cooper's table, he turned to Bennett.\r\n\r\n\"Your witness.\"\r\n\r\nBennett slouched into the open area before the judge's table. \"No\r\nquestions. Mrs. Russell, widowed by those savages, has surely suffered\r\nenough.\"\r\n\r\nPamela Russell stayed sitting in the chair beside the judge's table,\r\nclutching her leather bag. Her bosom, Auguste saw, was rising and\r\nfalling with some powerful emotion.\r\n\r\n\"That's all, Pamela,\" David Cooper said softly. \"You can go now.\"\r\n\r\nShe stood up, looking like a woman in a trance, and moved slowly toward\r\nthe door in the rear of the courtroom. Auguste turned in his seat to\r\nwatch her. She stopped before Raoul, who was sitting near the back. He\r\nstared up at her as she pointed at him.\r\n\r\n\"How dare you call me a liar, Raoul de Marion! When it's you that lied\r\nabout what you told my husband. My husband never fired a gun before in\r\nhis life, and he had to stand up and be killed, because you took all the\r\nmen who could shoot away with you. I hope those papers ruin you.\"\r\n\r\nSpots of red stood out on her cheeks. She covered her face with her hand\r\nand rushed out of the courtroom.\r\n\r\n\"How come you didn't shut her up, Judge?\" Raoul shouted after she was\r\ngone.\r\n\r\n\"I figured she deserved to have her say,\" said Cooper calmly.\r\n\r\nFord said, \"The defense calls Miss Nancy Hale.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste's heart started to beat harder as he watched Nancy, tall and\r\nstraight in a pale violet dress, walk to the witness's chair. Just what\r\nhe had feared a year ago, when Nancy first asked him to make love to\r\nher, had happened. He felt a love for her--an impossible love, now--that\r\nwas as strong in its way as the love he felt for Redbird.\r\n\r\nIn answer to Ford's soft-spoken questions, Nancy told how she had been\r\ncaptured and how Auguste had intervened to protect her, and later to\r\nprotect Woodrow. She told how he had risked his life to escort her and\r\nWoodrow to safety, and had ended up being captured.\r\n\r\nBennett got up to cross-question.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Hale, this may be a hard question for you to answer in open court.\r\nBut it is important to this trial. It's well-known that Indians are no\r\nrespecters of the virtue of white women. So, what I'm asking you is ...\"\r\nHe paused and leaned over her. \"Were you subjected to anything of a\r\nshameful nature while you were a prisoner of the Sauk?\"\r\n\r\n\"Objection,\" called Ford. \"The question itself is shameful. It has no\r\npossible bearing on this case.\"\r\n\r\nJudge Cooper glared at Bennett. \"What call do you have to ask her that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Defense counsel has taken us down a lot of winding roads, Your Honor.\r\nI'm attempting to determine facts about the defendant's character.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll allow it,\" said Cooper, his voice low and reluctant, and Bennett\r\nturned with a look of satisfaction to Nancy and repeated his question.\r\n\r\nNancy looked him coldly in the eye. \"I've already said. Auguste de\r\nMarion protected me. I was never harmed.\"\r\n\r\nBennett narrowed his eyes. Raoul had chosen the man well for his\r\npurposes, Auguste thought, hating Bennett for tormenting Nancy.\r\n\r\n\"Well, but what about Auguste de Marion himself? Didn't you live in one\r\nof their huts with him? Did he ever approach you with lewd intent?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not!\" said Nancy. \"Yes, I did live in his--the word is\r\nwickiup, Mr. Bennett. But the situation was perfectly proper. His wife\r\nand child were with us all the time.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the back of the hall Raoul brayed, \"She probably enjoyed it. She\r\nalways had an eye for the mongrel.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste felt his neck grow hot. He wanted to kill. But someone would\r\nstop him before he reached Raoul; and even to try to attack him would\r\nonly confirm the picture Bennett was trying to paint, of a murderous\r\nsavage. He forced himself to sit still.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, he thought, as he breathed deeply to calm himself, it was Nancy\r\nwho was concealing the truth and Bennett and Raoul who sensed what had\r\nreally happened. But their very words for it--\"shameful,\" \"lewd\r\nintent\"--turned the truth into a lie.\r\n\r\nHe and Nancy had proclaimed their love in honor before the British Band.\r\nNow he felt as if he were tied down on a forest floor and weasels and\r\ncrows were biting and pecking at him. Why must he and Nancy hide their\r\nlove from these hate-filled people?\r\n\r\nHe heard indignant murmurs provoked by Raoul's outburst.\r\n\r\n\"Shocking!\" someone said.\r\n\r\n\"No gentleman would talk that way.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste heard Lieutenant Davis sitting behind him, say to one of his\r\nmen, \"If I weren't on duty, I'd teach that scoundrel a lesson.\"\r\n\r\nSomeone with the accent of Victoire called out, \"Raoul, your father is\r\nright! Tu es un sauvage!\"\r\n\r\nCooper pounded on his table with his wooden mallet until there was\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nThomas Ford called, \"Master Woodrow Prewitt, will you take the stand,\r\nplease?\"\r\n\r\nWoodrow walked past Auguste, who felt a warmth for him and, again, a\r\npang of longing for Eagle Feather.\r\n\r\nUnder Ford's questions, Woodrow told how White Bear and Redbird had\r\ntreated him like a foster son, and how White Bear had helped them\r\nescape.\r\n\r\nWhen it was Bennett's turn, he stood threateningly over Woodrow. \"Have\r\nyou forgotten, young man, that you had a real, white, Christian father\r\nand mother? Have you forgotten what the Indians did to them?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir,\" said Woodrow in a small voice.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, how can you make it out that this half-Indian and his squaw\r\nwere such fine people? They held you prisoner!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir, my pa used to whip me before breakfast and after supper. My ma\r\nlaid in bed most days, drunk. White Bear--Mr. Auguste--he was kind to\r\nme. So was his missus. Living with them was shinin'.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shining!\" Bennett looked disgusted.\r\n\r\nWoodrow shrugged. \"Well, would'a been, if the soldiers hadn't always\r\nbeen chasing us.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste heard the thump of boots. He turned to see Raoul storming up\r\nfrom the back of the room.\r\n\r\n\"That boy's lying!\" Raoul roared. \"Indians took me prisoner when I was\r\nhis age--I know firsthand how kind they are, I got the scars to prove\r\nit. The half-breed's white squaw has made it worthwhile for the kid to\r\nlie. If I get my hands on him, I'll beat the truth out of him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sit down, sir!\" Lieutenant Davis jumped up from his seat behind Auguste\r\nand blocked Raoul's way. Auguste turned to see Raoul's big frame just a\r\nfew feet from him, close enough for him to smell whiskey fumes.\r\n\r\n\"This is none of your business, Davis,\" Raoul growled.\r\n\r\n\"General Winfield Scott and Colonel Zachary Taylor commanded me to see\r\nthat this man receives a proper trial,\" said Davis in a calm, steady\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nJudge Cooper rapped his mallet. \"De Marion, I won't allow you to disrupt\r\nthis court.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul shouted at Cooper over Davis's shoulder. \"Don't you forget,\r\nCooper, that when you're not wearing that black robe you're just a small\r\nfarmer who bought his land from me and sells his crop to me.\"\r\n\r\nCooper was standing now, his jaw clenched. \"That's enough, de Marion.\r\nSit down.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul's head turned slowly from side to side. For a moment he stared at\r\nAuguste, his eyes full of hate. Auguste felt an answering hatred boiling\r\nup in his chest.\r\n\r\nRaoul and the lieutenant stood facing each other for a long, silent\r\nmoment. Then Raoul turned abruptly and strode back to his seat. Auguste,\r\nwhose attention had been fixed on Raoul and Davis, became aware of men\r\nsitting down all over the courtroom. He wondered whether they were\r\nRaoul's men.\r\n\r\nAuguste felt his guts squirm as he realized what a thin barrier\r\nprotected this trial from being abruptly ended. Raoul could call on his\r\ncrew of rogues to drag him out and hang him at once. The judge and the\r\nthree Federal soldiers might not be able to stop him.\r\n\r\nFord called Auguste to the witness chair. Auguste had sat rigid for so\r\nlong that standing up made him stumble, and Ford put a steadying hand on\r\nhis arm.\r\n\r\nAs he sat down he felt himself trembling at the sight of dozens of pale\r\neyes faces, hard, solemn and expressionless, looking at him. Bearded men\r\nsquirting tobacco juice into brass spittoons. Women eyeing him from\r\nunder bonnets. He looked for the friendly faces in the room--Nancy,\r\nWoodrow, Elysée, Guichard, Nicole, Frank.\r\n\r\nFord said, \"We've heard bits and pieces of your story from many\r\ndifferent people, Auguste. If you were just another Sauk Indian you\r\nwouldn't be on trial here today. You'd be with your people, what's left\r\nof them. But because you've lived with whites and your father was white\r\nand you have a claim to a white man's property, you're accused of being\r\na traitor and a murderer. I want you to tell us about your life. How\r\ncome you're both Indian and white man?\"\r\n\r\nAs Auguste talked he forgot the watching faces and saw again Sun Woman\r\nand Star Arrow, Black Hawk and Owl Carver, Redbird and Nancy, Saukenuk\r\nand Victoire, Old Man's Creek and the Bad Axe.\r\n\r\nWhen he was done, Ford thanked him quietly and sat down. It was\r\nBennett's turn.\r\n\r\nHe shuffled toward Auguste, fixing him with small eyes that glinted with\r\nmalice.\r\n\r\n\"We have to take your word for it that you spoke for peace in the\r\ncouncils of the Sauk and Fox Indians, don't we? And we have to take your\r\nword that you went to the camp of Colonel de Marion's spy battalion on\r\nan errand of peace, don't we?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right,\" Auguste said bitterly. \"Because all my witnesses are\r\ndead.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't try to get us to feel sorry for you,\" Bennett rasped. \"This\r\ncourtroom is full of people who've seen loved ones stabbed, shot,\r\nscalped, cut to pieces, burnt to ashes. At the hands of your Indians.\"\r\nHe raised his voice to a shout. \"And while that was happening, you were\r\nbehind the red fiends! Urging them on to kill and kill some more!\" He\r\nturned away, face twisted in disgust. \"I have no more questions for\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nCooper said, \"Does the defense have any more witnesses?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Your Honor,\" said Ford, and Auguste's heart sank as he walked back\r\nto his seat. Bennett, he felt, had finished him with those few sentences\r\nreminding people what the Sauk had done to them.\r\n\r\nAuguste turned to Ford, whose round face was blank, unreadable. No hope\r\nthere. Ford had done his best, Auguste was sure. But he had no more\r\nchance against the hatred here in Victor than Black Hawk's band had\r\nagainst the armies of the United States.\r\n\r\n_I am going to be hanged._\r\n\r\n\"Hold it there!\" called a voice from the doorway of the courtroom. \"He\r\n_has_ got two more witnesses.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste saw a tall, mustached man thumping up from the back of the court\r\nwith the aid of a crutch and a peg leg. Beside him a skinny man with a\r\nsmall head and a gap-toothed grin shuffled over the plank floor. A rifle\r\nhung from one long arm.\r\n\r\nIt took him a moment to recognize Otto Wegner and Eli Greenglove.\r\n\r\nAlert, wary, he watched them come up the aisle between the spectators'\r\nchairs.\r\n\r\nCooper raised a hand in warning, said, \"Mr. Greenglove, you'll have to\r\nput that rifle down before you come any farther.\"\r\n\r\n\"So be it,\" said Greenglove, handing the rifle to one of Jefferson\r\nDavis's corporals who had risen to bar his way. \"I just needed it to\r\nmake sure I got this far alive.\"\r\n\r\nFord came over to Auguste and said in a low voice, \"I take it these men\r\nare offering to testify in your defense. Do you want them?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think Wegner must be here to help me,\" said Auguste. \"But I don't\r\nknow why Greenglove is here.\" He remembered his conviction that\r\nGreenglove had missed him on purpose, and shrugged. \"I haven't got much\r\nto lose.\"\r\n\r\nFord began with Wegner, asking him how he came to be in Victor when word\r\nwas he had emigrated to Texas.\r\n\r\n\"My family and I only got as far as New Orleans, where we are buying\r\nprovisions to join the colony at San Felipe de Austin. Then this\r\ngentleman comes to me.\" Wegner pointed to Greenglove, now sitting in the\r\nfront row of spectators. \"He tells me Herr Auguste is to be tried at\r\nVictor. At once we take the steamboat. I pay for both his passage and\r\nmine, using money my family needs. I tell you this not to praise myself\r\nbut to show how much that man means to me.\" Now Wegner pointed to\r\nAuguste, who looked down at the floor, his face hot and his throat\r\nchoked.\r\n\r\nFord nodded gravely. \"I understand you were at Old Man's Creek, Mr.\r\nWegner. What happened to you?\"\r\n\r\nWegner told the story just as Auguste remembered it, ending, \"I lost my\r\nleg, but I still have my life, thanks to Auguste de Marion, for whom I\r\nnever did a single thing good.\"\r\n\r\n_If I could have taken him back to the Sauk camp, I might even have\r\nsaved his leg._\r\n\r\nFord said, \"Mr. Wegner, we've heard that Auguste de Marion is a murderer\r\nand a traitor to his country.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lies!\" said Otto Wegner firmly. \"By the rules of war he had every right\r\nto kill me and he did not. He is the most Christian man I have ever\r\nknown.\"\r\n\r\n_I wonder if Wegner knows I have never believed in any spirits but\r\nEarthmaker and the Turtle and the Bear._\r\n\r\nReturning from the witness chair, Wegner stopped to take Auguste's hand\r\nin both of his. \"I am so glad I could come and speak for you. You are a\r\n_great_ man, Herr Auguste.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste, struggling to hold back tears, murmured his thanks. Perhaps\r\nElysée could replace the money Wegner had spent getting here, if the\r\nPrussian was not too proud to take it.\r\n\r\nFord began questioning Eli Greenglove about Old Man's Creek.\r\n\r\n\"Hell, there weren't no Injuns in ambush in the woods,\" Greenglove\r\ndrawled. \"'Twas plain as day what was going on. They was a few scouts\r\nthat come to watch what happened to the peace party. Most of our men\r\nwere carrying a right powerful load of whiskey. Some of the men saw the\r\nscouts hiding in the woods and got excited. Colonel Raoul, he used that\r\nas an excuse to order us to finish off the Injuns with the white flag.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you shot Auguste?\" Ford asked.\r\n\r\n\"I give him that ear.\" Greenglove pointed in the general direction of\r\nAuguste's right ear. \"Hoped he'd be smart enough to play possum after he\r\nwas hit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why did you choose not to kill Auguste? Did you think it would be\r\nmurder?\"\r\n\r\nGreenglove cackled scornfully. \"Hell, that never stopped me before. No,\r\nit was real simple.\" He paused, and the courtroom was still. \"I saved\r\nthat boy's life because I wanted Colonel Raoul to marry my daughter,\r\nClarissa.\"\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly Eli Greenglove started to cry. Tears ran down his bony\r\ncheeks and sobs shook his lean frame.\r\n\r\nFord stood looking wide-eyed, turned to stare at Auguste, who himself\r\nwas dumbfounded, having never seen a man like Eli Greenglove cry.\r\n\r\nBennett broke the embarrassed silence. \"Your Honor, I don't see what\r\nthis man's daughter has to do with the case.\"\r\n\r\nGreenglove's moist eyes narrowed to angry slits. \"Just shut up a minute,\r\nlawyer, and I'll tell you. My daughter lived with Raoul de Marion for\r\nseven years and bore him two kids, but he wouldn't marry her because she\r\nweren't good enough for him. No, he had to have the preacher's daughter.\r\nThat lady, Miss Hale.\" He pointed toward the spectators. \"But she was\r\nsweet on Mr. Pierre's boy, Auguste, and I could see he had an eye for\r\nher too. As long as Auguste was alive, I figured there'd be a chance\r\nthat Miss Hale would run off with him. So I made sure to keep him\r\nalive.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste's heart sank. If the jury believed what Greenglove was saying\r\nnow, wouldn't that make them think that there must have been something\r\nbetween him and Nancy when she was kidnapped by the Sauk?\r\n\r\nGreenglove's lips drew back from his stained teeth. \"But then that\r\nsonofabitch Raoul had to go and kill Black Hawk's men that brought the\r\nwhite flag. There weren't no real war before that happened. If he'd sent\r\nthem messengers on to General Atkinson, the whole thing would've been\r\nover in May. Every one of them white people, soldiers and farmers, men,\r\nwomen and children, was killed by that man there.\" He pointed a skinny\r\nfinger in Raoul's direction. \"Meanin' my daughter Clarissa and my two\r\ngrandkids.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your daughter was a slut, Greenglove,\" Raoul shouted. \"I'd've never\r\nmarried her if she lived to be a hundred.\" Auguste turned and saw him\r\nstanding in the back of the courtroom, Perrault and a few more of his\r\nbully boys flanking him.\r\n\r\n\"Oh?\" said Greenglove in a whisper that somehow was loud enough for the\r\nwhole court to hear. \"You are very lucky they took my rifle away from\r\nme, Colonel Raoul.\"\r\n\r\nFord said, \"I think that's all. Mr. Bennett, do you wish to\r\ncross-examine?\"\r\n\r\nRaoul, from the back, cut in, \"Judge, this man is a deserter from my\r\nmilitia battalion. He's been on the run for the past three months. What\r\nhe's said here is worth nothing.\"\r\n\r\nCooper frowned at Greenglove, then at Raoul. \"I don't see what\r\ndifference that makes. They bring convicted criminals out of prison\r\ncells to testify.\"\r\n\r\nFord said, \"In fact, if this man risked arrest to come here, that makes\r\nhis testimony all the more believable. To say nothing of going all the\r\nway to New Orleans to bring Mr. Wegner back.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it doesn't show him any more honest,\" Bennett spoke up. \"It just\r\nmeans he wants revenge against Raoul de Marion.\"\r\n\r\nCooper rapped with his mallet. \"The testimony can stand. The jury'll\r\ndecide what it's worth. Lieutenant Davis, have your corporals see that\r\nMr. Wegner and Mr. Greenglove reach the town limits safely. And then,\r\nLieutenant, I'd like a word with you. Meanwhile, the lawyers for each\r\nside can sum up.\"\r\n\r\nFlanked by the two blue-coated corporals, Greenglove and Otto Wegner\r\nstarted side by side toward the courtroom door, Wegner's peg leg\r\nthumping on the plank floor.\r\n\r\n\"You go to Hell, Eli!\" Raoul snarled as Greenglove passed him.\r\n\r\nGreenglove laughed. \"I got a better idea from ol' Otto here. I'm a-going\r\nto Texas!\"\r\n\r\nThe two men walked out the door as a silence fell over the courtroom.\r\n\r\nAuguste wondered, had their testimony saved him? They had told the truth\r\nabout what happened at Old Man's Creek, but since when had truth meant\r\nanything to the pale eyes? If those twelve men sitting in church pews on\r\nthe right side of the courtroom decided they wanted to hang him, they\r\nwould hang him even if their Jesus spirit himself came into the\r\ncourtroom and told the truth about him.\r\n\r\nAnd after seeing the slaughter at the Bad Axe, could Auguste doubt that\r\nkilling all red people was what all pale eyes most wanted to do?\r\n\r\nCooper and the lieutenant talked quietly at the judge's table. When\r\nCooper called on Bennett to sum up, the prosecutor rose and sidled over\r\nto the jury.\r\n\r\n\"About the supposed adoption papers and Pierre de Marion's alleged will,\r\nMrs. Russell's claim that Mr. Raoul de Marion ordered these papers\r\ndestroyed is hearsay. She has no direct knowledge that Mr. de Marion\r\ngave any such instructions to her husband. More important--if Pierre de\r\nMarion adopted Auguste, that makes Auguste a U.S. citizen, and his\r\nparticipating in acts of war by the Sauk nation against the United\r\nStates is treason. Auguste made war on his own flag.\r\n\r\n\"Whether Raoul de Marion did right or wrong in running his nephew off\r\nVictoire, gentlemen, one thing is sure. Auguste went back to the British\r\nBand carrying a powerful grudge against this place and these people.\r\nSo, I put it to you, he decided that if he could not be a white\r\nlandowner, he would destroy the white landowners.\r\n\r\n\"And he had the power to do it, because the Indians would listen to him.\r\nThey knew him as a witch doctor, and they also knew that he had been\r\neducated among whites. And so he used his power to push Black Hawk\r\ntoward war. He is an accomplice to the murder of every white man, woman\r\nand child killed by his fellow tribesmen.\r\n\r\n\"Auguste de Marion or White Bear or whatever he chooses to call\r\nhimself\"--Bennett pointed an accusing finger at Auguste--\"should be\r\nhanged as a traitor and a butcher of his own people.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste heard mutterings of approval from around the courtroom and a\r\nloud \"Damned right!\" from Raoul. His feeling that this trial was\r\nhopeless grew deeper. Bennett had told the jury what they wanted to\r\nhear--the version of the truth that would let them do what they wanted\r\nto him.\r\n\r\nFord stood up, wiping his brow. The room was hot for late September. He\r\ncrossed the front of the courtroom to stand before the two rows of\r\njurymen in their borrowed church pews.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen of the jury, I took up arms against the Sauk and Fox Indians\r\nunder General Edmund Gaines in 1831. I am not prejudiced in favor of\r\nIndians. I only ask that you try to understand _this_ man whose life is\r\nin your hands.\r\n\r\n\"You have to decide two questions: One, by traveling and living with the\r\nBritish Band of the Sauk and Fox from September 1831 to August 1832, did\r\nAuguste de Marion commit treason against the United States? Two, is\r\nAuguste de Marion guilty of the murder of any citizens of the United\r\nStates or the state of Illinois?\r\n\r\n\"Is Auguste a traitor to his country? Well, it seems to me that if\r\nanything, Auguste holds dual citizenship in the United States and in the\r\nSauk and Fox nation. And, far from being a traitor to either, he tried\r\nto make peace between them. The only thing he ever carried against the\r\nUnited States was a white flag.\r\n\r\n\"Has Auguste committed murder? All we know for a fact is that no one has\r\nseen him raise a violent hand against another human being. Otto Wegner\r\ntold you how Auguste had a chance to kill him, and instead helped him\r\nescape. At great peril to himself.\r\n\r\n\"You've heard Pierre de Marion's will, which explains why Raoul de\r\nMarion, who illegally seized the great house known as Victoire, has been\r\nso eager to hound this young man to his death.\r\n\r\n\"This man has lost everything a man holds dear. His father and mother.\r\nHis home here in Victor. His home among the Sauk.\r\n\r\n\"Almost all of his people, his loved ones and the friends of his youth,\r\nhave been killed. Everyone who lives in Victor knows to their sorrow\r\nwhat happened to his infant daughter. His wife and son are captives,\r\ntoo, and he cannot be with them or provide for them. Which of you,\r\nhaving had so much taken from him so cruelly, would not go mad with\r\ngrief?\r\n\r\n\"He has lost so much. All he has left is his life. Let us not, I beg of\r\nyou, take that from him as well.\"\r\n\r\nFord sat down in the midst of a heavy silence. Auguste tried to send his\r\nshaman's sense forward into the future to tell him how the jury would\r\ndecide, but his spirit met a blank wall.\r\n\r\nHe glanced out a nearby unshuttered window and saw a blue afternoon sky\r\nwith a few white clouds. Within the wooden walls of this courtroom, sky\r\nand sun, prairie and river, seemed very far away.\r\n\r\nJudge Cooper said, \"Gentlemen of the jury, we have prepared a room\r\nupstairs for you. We'll send food and drink to you as you require. There\r\nare cots in case you can't make up your minds today.\"\r\n\r\nAs he watched the twelve men file up the stairs behind the judge's\r\ntable, Auguste could not stop his mind from wandering to the worst. He\r\nthought about what it would be like to be hanged, the rough grip of the\r\nrope on his neck, the blood bursting in his head, the world going black,\r\nhis body jerking in hopeless struggle, breath cut off, lungs aching, the\r\nfinal silencing of his heart.\r\n\r\nHe heard a harsh laugh in the back of the room. He turned and saw Raoul\r\nin the midst of a group of men standing near the doorway of the\r\ncourtroom. Beside Raoul was Armand Perrault. Raoul looked at Auguste and\r\nsmiled. Auguste knew what that smile meant.\r\n\r\nWhatever the jury decided, for him there would be no escape from death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n23\r\n\r\nSharp Knife\r\n\r\n\r\nLate that afternoon, Lieutenant Davis called Auguste from his cell and\r\ntook him down to the courtroom.\r\n\r\n\"Judge said send for you. I think maybe the jury's reached a verdict.\"\r\n\r\nEntering through the rear door of the courtroom, Auguste met Raoul's\r\neyes and his longing for vengeance made his blood feel like molten metal\r\nin his veins.\r\n\r\nThe jurymen came in through a side door. Robert McAllister, foreman of\r\nthe jury, glanced at Auguste, then handed David Cooper a folded piece of\r\npaper.\r\n\r\n\"He looked at you,\" Ford whispered. \"It's an old tale among lawyers that\r\nif members of the jury have found the defendant guilty, they don't look\r\nat him.\"\r\n\r\nCooper read the note and sighed loudly, as if he found the message\r\nburdensome. Then he took goose quill and ink and wrote a note of his\r\nown. McAllister watched him write, looking over his shoulder, sighed as\r\nheavily as Cooper had, looked at Auguste again. After a moment he nodded\r\nand took the judge's note back upstairs.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Judge Cooper to the courtroom at large, \"it seems the\r\njury's a pretty fair distance from a verdict. They can't agree on a lot\r\nof things. So, I've given orders that they stay upstairs and keep at it.\r\nIt looks like we won't have a guilty or not guilty until tomorrow. The\r\nprisoner will go back upstairs to his cell. Court will open at nine\r\no'clock in the morning.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste heard the rear door of the courtroom slam and knew without\r\nlooking around that Raoul had left.\r\n\r\nThat night Auguste lay on his corn-husk mattress wondering whether he\r\nshould try to run away when they took him out. To be shot while trying\r\nto escape might be more honorable than hanging. He wished he could see\r\nRedbird and Eagle Feather one last time. He wished Nancy would come to\r\nvisit him. Or at least Nicole, Grandpapa or Frank. But Lieutenant Davis\r\nsaid that for the prisoner's safety no one would be allowed into the\r\nvillage hall tonight.\r\n\r\nHe heard a key turning in his door lock. He climbed to his feet.\r\n\r\n\"Come on,\" said Davis quickly. \"We're taking you out of here.\"\r\n\r\n_They've come to kill me_, Auguste thought. It would not be the first\r\ntime an inconvenient Indian was \"shot while trying to escape.\" But his\r\nshaman's insight told him Davis was as trustworthy as any Sauk.\r\n\r\n\"Why? Before the verdict?\"\r\n\r\n\"They did reach a verdict today. You are found not guilty.\"\r\n\r\nNot guilty! Joy flooded through him as he stood, so amazed that he could\r\nnot move, staring at the open cell door.\r\n\r\nWhen he had recovered enough to move, Auguste followed Davis out of the\r\nvillage hall, to where the two corporals waited with horses in the\r\nsilent street. The river rippled black and silver in the light of a\r\nthree-quarter moon. The Ioway bluffs opposite were black bison shapes\r\nunder a sky spangled with stars.\r\n\r\nThe moonlight helped Auguste guide his horse up the steep road out of\r\nthe village. Davis led, followed by Auguste, the two corporals bringing\r\nup the rear. After weeks of imprisonment, Auguste reveled in the cool\r\nnight air blowing in his face.\r\n\r\nThey passed the trading post. The road was wider here, and the three\r\nsoldiers bunched around him. Raoul was surely in there getting drunk,\r\nlaughing as he looked forward to seeing Auguste swinging at a rope's\r\nend.\r\n\r\nThey trotted along the ridge leading to Victoire. Auguste's heart\r\nstarted to beat harder as he approached the place that had been his\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nThe remains of the mansion sprawled on its hilltop like the skeleton of\r\nsome huge animal, blackened timbers rearing up in the moonlight. People\r\nhad died bloody, horrible deaths there. Was the place haunted now?\r\nAccursed?\r\n\r\nA longing came over him to climb that hill again, to sweep away that\r\nruin and rebuild. Put up a fine new house like the ones he'd seen in the\r\nEast.\r\n\r\n_I could do so much with this land, but I'm running away from it again.\r\nLeaving it to Raoul again._\r\n\r\nThen they were past Victoire, but the yearning for it clung to him like\r\na lover's scent.\r\n\r\n\"By morning you'll be far out of your uncle's reach,\" said Davis, riding\r\nbeside him.\r\n\r\nAuguste's heart swelled in his chest with the thought that he was more\r\nnearly a free man than he had been in weeks.\r\n\r\n\"If I'm not guilty, why must I run away?\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely you realize that your uncle and his cronies were planning to\r\ntake you straight from the courtroom to the nearest tall tree if the\r\ncourt didn't sentence you to death. The foreman brought Judge Cooper a\r\nnote stating their verdict. The judge wrote back, telling them he would\r\nsay they hadn't reached a verdict, and he wanted them to remain in\r\nseclusion overnight while we spirited you out of town. They were willing\r\nto put up with the inconvenience. After all, who'd want to find a man\r\nnot guilty and then see him taken out and hanged?\"\r\n\r\nAuguste's heart felt like a cup that was overflowing. The jury had\r\nunderstood him; they had believed him.\r\n\r\n\"I never even got a chance to thank Mr. Ford.\"\r\n\r\n\"Main thanks he'd want is knowing that you got away safely.\"\r\n\r\nAs they rode on, Auguste's happiness faded. The town that had been his\r\nhome for six years had exonerated him. But he still had to run away from\r\nit at night, for the second time in his life. He hated to do this.\r\n\r\nThis was something else Raoul had taken from him--his moment of\r\nvindication.\r\n\r\nPain throbbed in Auguste's chest with the jouncing of the horse under\r\nhim. He remembered his mother's body, like a castaway doll, her eyes\r\npathetically wide, the gash in her throat, the splash of blood on her\r\ndoeskin dress. She must be avenged. How could he let the man who\r\nmurdered her walk free? Silently he called on the Bear spirit to avenge\r\nSun Woman.\r\n\r\nAgain he remembered it was wrong to ask a spirit to harm any person.\r\nEven so, if he could not hurt Raoul himself, he wanted him hurt,\r\nwhatever price he himself might pay.\r\n\r\nAnd once again he was fleeing from people he loved. Elysée. Nicole and\r\nFrank.\r\n\r\nNancy.\r\n\r\n\"Soon I must go back,\" he said.\r\n\r\nDavis turned his head to stare at him. \"Go back? In the name of the\r\ngreat Jehovah, what for?\"\r\n\r\nIt was Auguste's turn to be surprised. It seemed so obvious that he had\r\nto return to Victor and face Raoul.\r\n\r\n\"I belong in Victor as much as I belong with the Sauk.\"\r\n\r\nHe could not, he decided, turn his back on Victor a second time.\r\n\r\n\"Why are we going east?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"You've have been found not guilty in Victor, but you're still a\r\nprisoner of war, Auguste. Your future is in the hands of the President\r\nof the United States.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste remembered now. General Winfield Scott at the hearing at Fort\r\nCrawford had said, _If the people of Smith County don't hang you, I\r\nthink President Jackson would find a meeting with you most interesting_.\r\n\r\nA chill spread across his back at the thought of meeting Andrew Jackson\r\nhimself. What would he and Sharp Knife have to say to each other?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAuguste leaned into a small window cut in the thick stone wall of Fort\r\nMonroe. He stared through iron grillwork at a blue-gray expanse of\r\nrippling water. Eastward on the horizon lay low land, the other side of\r\nChesapeake Bay. Pressing his forehead against the bars he could see the\r\nbay opening to the south into that vast open ocean the pale eyes had\r\ncrossed in their relentless search for new land.\r\n\r\nA faint breeze cooled Auguste's sweat-beaded brow. This was the Moon of\r\nFalling Leaves, but it was still hot as summer.\r\n\r\nBlack Hawk had said little since their arrival. No doubt, Auguste\r\nthought, the old war leader was comparing this huge stone fortress with\r\nthe log forts of the long knives he had besieged in his own country. He\r\nmust be absorbing the lesson it taught of the true magnitude of the long\r\nknives' power. But when he did speak he sounded as defiant as ever.\r\n\r\n\"Why must I wear the clothing of my enemies?\" Black Hawk stood in his\r\nloincloth staring at the uniform that a soldier had laid out on his bed.\r\nAuguste admired Black Hawk's lean, muscular body. It was hard to believe\r\nthat he had seen sixty-seven summers and winters. His wide mouth was\r\ndrawn down with distaste as he eyed the tall, red-plumed shako, the\r\ndark blue jacket with its gold-trimmed collar, gold lace chevrons on the\r\nupper arms and brass buttons, the lighter blue trousers, the white\r\nleather belt.\r\n\r\n\"Sharp Knife wishes to show his respect for you by giving you the dress\r\nof one of his war chiefs,\" said Auguste.\r\n\r\n_It is also his way of reminding you that you are subject to him._\r\n\r\nOwl Carver said, \"It is a mark of hospitality. Just as Chief Falcon gave\r\nus new doeskin garments when we surrendered to the Winnebago.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste felt a thrill of pride as he recalled the amazing tale Owl\r\nCarver had told him about Eagle Feather's part in that surrender. A boy\r\nnot yet seven summers old whose vision moved him and showed him how to\r\nbring a war to an end was surely destined for great things.\r\n\r\nOwl Carver looked strange, with his long white hair and megis-shell\r\nnecklace, in a peacock-blue cutaway coat and tight gray trousers.\r\nAuguste was also wearing a pale eyes' suit with a dark brown jacket. The\r\nWinnebago Prophet was dressed similarly in shades of green and gray.\r\nAuguste had shown Owl Carver and Flying Cloud how to don the pale eyes'\r\nclothing, and now they stood stiff and uncomfortable in the room they\r\nshared, waiting for Black Hawk to put on his military garb.\r\n\r\nOwl Carver said, \"And the American pale eyes are not your enemies any\r\nmore. You have made your mark on the treaty paper.\"\r\n\r\n\"This time for all time,\" said Auguste, putting his heart into his\r\nvoice, remembering that Black Hawk had signed and broken treaties\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nBlack Hawk sighed. \"The spirits of hundreds dead at the Bad Axe cry out\r\nto me that the Americans are still our enemies.\"\r\n\r\nThat was ever Black Hawk's way, Auguste thought, brooding on old wrongs,\r\nregretting agreements made with the pale eyes. Irreconcilable.\r\n\r\n_He will never change. But we must change._\r\n\r\nOne hope had preoccupied Auguste throughout the month-long journey east,\r\nby steamboat to Cincinnati, where he caught up with Black Hawk's party,\r\nby horse-drawn coach and finally by that astonishing new pale eyes'\r\ninvention, the railroad. Auguste must find a way for the Sauk to live in\r\na world where the pale eyes ruled absolutely. He was the only one who\r\nunderstood both Sauk and pale eyes. It was up to him.\r\n\r\n\"Do you want to say again the words you will speak to Sharp Knife?\"\r\nAuguste asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Black Hawk. \"Will he be surprised to hear me speak to him in\r\nhis own language?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very surprised. He will know you are a very smart man.\"\r\n\r\nHaltingly Black Hawk repeated his speech in English, which Auguste had,\r\nat the chief's request, been teaching him. Black Hawk had told Auguste\r\nwhat he wanted to say. Auguste had translated it, and the old leader had\r\nlearned it word by word.\r\n\r\nSmiling, Owl Carver said, \"This is just what your vision foretold, White\r\nBear, that Black Hawk would speak to Sharp Knife in Sharp Knife's own\r\nlodge.\"\r\n\r\n_Yes, and I told you then that it did not mean Black Hawk would conquer\r\nSharp Knife._\r\n\r\nBut Auguste did not have the heart to remind Owl Carver of the unhappy\r\nreality. Silently he helped the reluctant Black Hawk dress.\r\n\r\nHe wished now that he might have another vision of the future beyond\r\nthis moment.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt took Black Hawk and his companions two days to travel by steamboat\r\nfrom Fort Monroe to Washington City. As the meeting with Sharp Knife\r\ndrew closer, Auguste grew more and more fearful. If Jackson and Black\r\nHawk quarreled, the President might decide to throw all of them into\r\nprison for life. He might even have them quietly killed. He was the most\r\npowerful man between the two oceans.\r\n\r\nThey slept overnight in the ship's cabin. Auguste dreamed that he stood\r\nempty-handed and helpless while Raoul came at him with a huge dagger.\r\n\r\nThe next day, at about nine in the morning, Black Hawk and his three\r\nadvisors were riding in an open carriage down Pennsylvania Avenue, with\r\ncolumns of long knives four abreast on horseback before and behind.\r\nAuguste felt bewildered listening to the rattle of hooves. Only a few\r\nmoons ago the long knives were hunting Black Hawk and his band. Now they\r\nescorted Black Hawk with honor. The change was dizzying.\r\n\r\nAuguste looked about him curiously at the capital of the United States.\r\nIt was a sprawl of large brick and frame houses, and Pennsylvania Avenue\r\nwas a muddy, deeply rutted thoroughfare as wide as a cornfield. Behind\r\nthem on its hill was the Capitol Building, an immense square stone\r\nstructure topped by three low domes. The air was thick and damp and hot,\r\nand moisture-laden gray clouds lay overhead. Auguste longed for the\r\ndrier climate of Illinois.\r\n\r\nPale eyes and many of their black-skinned slaves stood under the poplar\r\ntrees lining the sides of the avenue. They waved cheerfully to Black\r\nHawk and clapped their hands. From time to time Black Hawk raised a hand\r\nin solemn greeting.\r\n\r\nAuguste had expected that they would have to endure jeers and cries of\r\nhatred when they were paraded through Washington City. But,\r\nsurprisingly, people were welcoming them as if they were heroes. It gave\r\nhim a feeling of hope. His people might learn to live with these people.\r\n\r\nAuguste was awed by the size of the President's House, three or four\r\ntimes bigger than Victoire. It stood behind an iron fence at the western\r\nend of Pennsylvania Avenue. All this for the Great Father, thought\r\nAuguste. It seemed all the more impressive because the entire building\r\nwas painted white.\r\n\r\nAmong the Sauk, colors always meant something. Auguste asked Jefferson\r\nDavis, who had ridden with their mounted escort, what the white of the\r\nPresident's House meant.\r\n\r\nDavis smiled wryly. \"Why, that's to hide the scorch marks from where the\r\nredcoats burned it in 1814.\"\r\n\r\nBut how fitting it seemed that the Great Father of the white people\r\nshould live in a white palace. Auguste felt a tingle of excitement as\r\nthe blue-coated officers ushered his party up the front steps.\r\n\r\nOwl Carver stuck his hand into a pocket of his jacket and pulled out the\r\ngold watch that had once been Pierre de Marion's. He smiled, toothless,\r\nat Auguste.\r\n\r\n\"You told me I could use this to tell when the pale eyes will do things.\r\nSee now. One of the long knife chiefs told me this.\" He pointed to the\r\nface of the watch. \"When the long arrow is here and the short arrow is\r\nhere, we will meet with Sharp Knife.\" He had pointed to the numerals XII\r\nand XI--eleven o'clock in the morning.\r\n\r\nThey awaited Sharp Knife in the East Room of the President's House. An\r\nofficer told the four Sauk to stand abreast, with Black Hawk at the\r\nright end of their line and Auguste on the left. The arrangement told\r\nAuguste that the long knives considered him the least important member\r\nof the Sauk delegation, an estimate with which he agreed. A dozen long\r\nknife colonels, majors, captains, lieutenants, all in blue jackets and\r\ngold braid, stood in two groups flanking the Sauk.\r\n\r\nEven though he had never had any reason to doubt his shaman's vision,\r\nAuguste was surprised at how exactly he had seen the room they were\r\nstanding in--its rows of windows with blue and yellow drapes, its three\r\nglittering chandeliers and the four huge mirrors in gilded frames facing\r\neach other across an immense blue and yellow carpet with a red border.\r\nUnder each mirror was a fireplace. Four fireplaces, to keep one room\r\nwarm in winter.\r\n\r\nThe long arrow on Owl Carver's watch had moved from XII to VI, and the\r\nold man was uttering doubts of its power to tell him anything when a\r\nblack servant opened a door at the far end of the room and all the long\r\nknives in the room drew themselves up stiffly, clicking their heels\r\ntogether. Sharp Knife came slowly into the room.\r\n\r\nAndrew Jackson in person looked just as he had in Auguste's vision, only\r\nmore terrifying. Whatever unknown red man had first called him Sharp\r\nKnife had chosen aptly. With his long, narrow face and his\r\nextraordinarily tall, thin body, he looked like a blade come to life. A\r\nshock of white hair stood up as stiff as Wolf Paw's crest on top of his\r\nhead, and thick white eyebrows shadowed eyes as bright as splinters of\r\nsteel.\r\n\r\nRaoul's words of over a year ago came back to Auguste: _I'd like to see\r\nwhat an old Indian killer like Andy Jackson would say to you._\r\n\r\nAuguste felt he was face to face with the power that had destroyed the\r\nSauk. This man, with his own hand, had slain Indians by the hundreds,\r\nhad uprooted whole nations and driven them westward. This was the leader\r\nof those endless swarms of murderous, grasping pale eyes who, territory\r\nby territory, were driving the red people from their homes. This was the\r\nman who willed that white people should fill all the land from ocean to\r\nocean.\r\n\r\nBut Sharp Knife was also frail as an icicle. He moved one step at a\r\ntime, as if in great pain, and Auguste sensed that he was afflicted with\r\nmany ailments and troubled by many old wounds. Auguste saw in him an\r\nimmeasurably powerful spirit that kept him going in spite of so much\r\nsickness and pain.\r\n\r\n\"Which of you is the one that can speak English?\" Jackson asked. Auguste\r\nhad expected his voice to be like thunder, but it shrilled like a knife\r\non a grindstone.\r\n\r\nFeeling a painful hollow in his belly Auguste said, \"I am, Mr.\r\nPresident.\" Only this morning Davis had told him that was the way\r\nJackson was to be addressed. \"I am White Bear, also called Auguste de\r\nMarion.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Jackson turned his gaze on him, Auguste felt it with the force of\r\nan icy gale.\r\n\r\n\"Colonel Taylor wrote me a long letter about you. I want to have a talk\r\nwith you later. Now, tell the chief I am happy to greet him as a friend.\r\nTell him there will be peace between me and my red children as long as\r\nthe grass shall grow and the rivers shall run.\"\r\n\r\nA talk later? What did Jackson have in mind for him? Auguste wondered as\r\nhe translated for Black Hawk.\r\n\r\n\"Now shall I speak to him in his tongue?\" Black Hawk asked.\r\n\r\n\"This would be a good time,\" said Auguste.\r\n\r\nBlack Hawk took a step forward, leaving Owl Carver, Flying Cloud and\r\nAuguste standing behind him. Auguste saw that Black Hawk was shorter\r\nthan Jackson, but broader in chest and shoulders. And, Auguste believed,\r\nstronger and healthier though they were about the same age.\r\n\r\nBlack Hawk raised his right hand in greeting and said in English, \"I am\r\na man. And you are a man like me.\"\r\n\r\nJackson looked startled, then stood very straight and stared intently at\r\nBlack Hawk's bronze face as the war leader spoke the memorized words\r\nslowly, one at a time.\r\n\r\n\"We did not expect to conquer your people. I took up the tomahawk to\r\navenge great wrongs that we could no longer bear. If I had not been\r\nwilling to fight, the young men would have said Black Hawk is too old to\r\nbe chief. They would have said Black Hawk is a woman. They would have\r\nsaid he is no Sauk. So I raised the war whoop. You are a war leader, and\r\nyou understand me. I need say no more. I ask you to give me your hand in\r\nfriendship and to let us return to our people.\"\r\n\r\n\"A very fine speech,\" said Jackson. \"I was not told that you spoke\r\nEnglish, Chief.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste repeated the President's comment in Sauk.\r\n\r\nBlack Hawk said, \"Tell him that you taught me how to say what I wanted\r\nto say in the pale eyes' tongue.\"\r\n\r\nJackson grunted. \"I see. Yes, White Bear, you and I will have to talk.\r\nWell, tell him that we will send him back to his people when we are\r\ncertain we'll have no more trouble from them.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste wanted to say, _Almost all the people who caused you trouble are\r\ndead_. But he merely translated Jackson's words for Black Hawk.\r\n\r\n_Why does Jackson want to talk to me?_ Auguste did not like the sound of\r\nit. Did Sharp Knife have in mind some treachery against Black Hawk?\r\n\r\nBlack Hawk said, \"Tell the Great Father that the Sauk will be quiet as\r\nlong as the pale eyes do no more harm to them.\" Auguste had a sinking\r\nfeeling, as he translated this, that he might well be reopening\r\nhostilities right here in the President's House.\r\n\r\nJackson answered, \"We never have done any wrong to your tribe. When we\r\nbuy land from people we expect them to honor their agreements.\"\r\n\r\n_Two stubborn men_, thought Auguste. Black Hawk was right in saying that\r\nthey were alike.\r\n\r\nWhen he told Black Hawk what Jackson had said, the chief answered, \"Say\r\nto him that I have thought much about this. I do not think land can be\r\nbought and sold. Earthmaker put it there for our use. If people leave\r\ntheir land, then someone else can take it and use it. But it is not\r\nsomething like a blanket or a pot, that can be carried away by its\r\nowner. It belongs to all Earthmaker's children.\"\r\n\r\nBlack Hawk's words worried Auguste, giving him the feeling that a storm\r\nwas about to break. Jackson, he knew, was a hot-tempered man, a man who\r\nhad killed others in duels. Black Hawk might be bringing further trouble\r\non himself, on all of them, by speaking so candidly to Sharp Knife.\r\n\r\nHe considered changing Black Hawk's words to a speech more\r\nagreeable-sounding. But that would be a kind of treachery, he decided.\r\nOut of loyalty to Black Hawk, he must convey his meaning exactly to\r\nSharp Knife. So, watching with inner trembling as Jackson frowned and\r\nshook his head, he faithfully translated.\r\n\r\nJackson looked directly at Auguste, not at Black Hawk, as he answered.\r\n\r\n\"You Indians just do not understand that land is the source of all the\r\ngoods of civilization. That's why the white man is so much richer and\r\nmore powerful than the red man. Among us, every piece of land is owned\r\nby a particular man, and that man makes good use of his land to produce\r\nwealth. Never mind, don't translate that,\" he ordered. \"It's just as\r\nwell the chief and I have no more words on this point right now.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste felt deep relief that Black Hawk's words had not angered\r\nJackson. Unsmiling, the President took a stiff step toward Black Hawk\r\nand thrust out his hand. Black Hawk reached out to him, and they clasped\r\nhands solemnly, staring into each other's eyes. Auguste felt a shiver\r\nrun through him at the sight of that handclasp. Now Black Hawk's war\r\nwith the pale eyes was truly at an end.\r\n\r\nThe white officers standing on either side of Jackson and Black Hawk\r\nclapped their hands, and after a moment of hesitation Auguste, Owl\r\nCarver and the Winnebago Prophet applauded too.\r\n\r\nJackson said, \"Lieutenant Davis, take the chief and these two older\r\nmedicine men on a tour of the President's House and the gardens.\" He\r\nturned his blue eyes on Auguste. \"White Bear--Mr. de Marion--I'd like\r\nyou to accompany me to my office for a private word.\"\r\n\r\nNow Auguste's heart pounded as he followed Jackson, accompanied by two\r\nsoldiers, up a flight of stairs. He sensed that Jackson must have\r\ndemands in mind, and knew that because of what he had been--_old Indian\r\nkiller_--the Sauk would not be helped by his yielding to those demands.\r\nBut what might refusal mean? Imprisonment? Death?\r\n\r\nJackson's office was a large room, well lit by big glass windows, where\r\nthe President's polished oak desk was piled high with papers. The two\r\nsoldiers stationed themselves on either side of the door, and as Auguste\r\nentered behind Jackson he saw a guard with a bayonet-mounted rifle\r\nstanding like a wooden statue in one corner of the room. Auguste\r\nwondered whether there was always a guard there, or only when Jackson\r\nhad an Indian visitor. Jackson folded his tall body inch by painful inch\r\ninto a large mahogany chair. With a gesture he invited Auguste to sit\r\nopposite him in a comfortable chair with curving wooden arms and legs.\r\n\r\n\"I want you to consider staying here in Washington City, Mr. de Marion,\"\r\nJackson said abruptly. \"I think you can be of great service to your\r\nIndian people and to the United States. I'm impressed by the way you\r\nprepared that speech for Black Hawk. Zack Taylor has written me that\r\nyou're a remarkably learned fellow. There are plenty of men and women\r\nwho straddle the border between the white and the red races, but most of\r\nthem are trash--illiterates and drunks who hang around Army posts. You\r\nseem to be an important man both in the white world and among your\r\nfellow tribesmen.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste's body went cold. Jackson did want him to work for him. He found\r\nhimself resenting the President's apparent expectation that he could\r\neasily be won over. But he was afraid that if he refused outright\r\nJackson might take it out on the Sauk.\r\n\r\nHe shook his head. \"You overestimate me, Mr. President. I have no\r\nimportance in the white world. I had a place, but it was taken from me.\r\nAmong the Sauk--yes, I am what you would call a medicine man, but I\r\nbegged them not to go to war against the whites and they did not listen\r\nto me.\"\r\n\r\nJackson waved that away with a long, bony hand. \"I can see that you are\r\ncapable of accomplishing much. I have a situation for you in my Bureau\r\nof Indian Affairs. If you do well in that post you might one day head\r\nthe bureau as Commissioner, responsible for the welfare of all the\r\nIndian tribes under the protection of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste felt overwhelmed. Jackson's proposal went far beyond anything he\r\nhad imagined. Was he wrong in thinking that he must refuse?\r\n\r\nNo, he must reject Jackson's offer. The President meant to use him\r\nagainst his own people.\r\n\r\nAuguste looked straight into Jackson's steel-splinter eyes. \"You expect\r\nmore trouble with the Indians, don't you, Mr. President?\"\r\n\r\nJackson frowned. \"Why do you say that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Up to now you've been assuring the red men that they could live in\r\npeace on the west side of the Mississippi. But now you can't promise\r\nthem that anymore.\"\r\n\r\n\"You _are_ a medicine man, de Marion. How have you divined that?\"\r\n\r\nAuguste felt as if he were walking on bad ice and might at any moment\r\nbreak through and drown. He should not be so bold with this all-powerful\r\nman.\r\n\r\n\"I know that General Scott has signed a treaty with He Who Moves Alertly\r\nwhereby the Sauk give up a strip of land fifty miles wide running down\r\nthe _west_ side of the Mississippi.\"\r\n\r\nJackson clenched his fist until the knuckles showed white. \"You were\r\nnot supposed to learn about that treaty till you returned to Sauk\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\n\"We traveled over a thousand miles, Mr. President. We talked to many\r\npeople, and they talked to us.\"\r\n\r\n\"And with someone who speaks English as well as you do in the party, you\r\nwere bound to learn. Does Black Hawk know about this?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.\"\r\n\r\nJackson's smile was knowing. _He thinks I'm willing to betray Black\r\nHawk._\r\n\r\nBefore Jackson could speak, Auguste said, \"He would be angry if he knew.\r\nHe would protest to you. And it would do no good. It would only mar the\r\nmeeting between you and him.\"\r\n\r\nSharp Knife's smile broadened. \"Exactly the sort of tactful decision I'd\r\nexpect of you. Just why I want you to help me.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste was frightened, but felt he must make it clear to Jackson where\r\nhe stood.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. President, when you force the red people to give up land west of\r\nthe Great River, how will they live? Soon there won't be enough land for\r\nthem to hunt on.\"\r\n\r\nJackson spread his hands. \"If their food supply runs short, our Indian\r\nagents can supply them until they find other means of livelihood.\"\r\n\r\nTo depend on government agents for the very food they put into their\r\nmouths? That would be a kind of prison.\r\n\r\nHis heart galloping, Auguste decided to speak even more boldly. \"You are\r\nlooking for someone to reconcile the red man to having his land stolen\r\nfrom him, Mr. President.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. de Marion, the United States is not a thief.\" A fierce glare lit\r\nJackson's eyes.\r\n\r\n_I must try to be bold without being rude._\r\n\r\n\"I meant no insult, Mr. President. The red man _thinks_ his land is\r\nbeing stolen from him.\"\r\n\r\nJackson frowned at Auguste as if he was not sure whether he was being\r\nsarcastic, and, indeed, hearing his own words, Auguste was not quite\r\nsure how he meant them.\r\n\r\n\"Exactly,\" Jackson said. \"The red man doesn't understand what is\r\nhappening. You can help to see that this _must_ be.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste hesitated. He had not had time to think. He was not ready to\r\ndecide his whole future and perhaps bargain away the future of his\r\npeople in a moment. Staying here in Washington City just might be the\r\nbest thing he could do for the Sauk. Working for and with Jackson, he\r\ncould protect his people, warn them of danger, avert attacks on them.\r\n\r\nBut his choosing to refuse Jackson was not the outcome of a momentary\r\nimpulse. His whole life had taken him to this place on his path. The\r\npath might wind; its direction might sometimes be lost in shadows. But\r\nit did not lead to Sharp Knife. Jackson was a far better man than Raoul,\r\nbut they were both on the same side, the side of the dispossessors.\r\n\r\n\"What the red men don't understand, Mr. President, is how much they are\r\ngiving up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Black Hawk said land can't be bought and sold,\" Jackson said. \"Then it\r\nbelongs to whoever can make the best use of it.\"\r\n\r\nEach man owning his own land and defending it against all comers,\r\nthought Auguste, that was the centerpost of the white way of life.\r\n\r\n\"I understand that you feel a responsibility to your people, to provide\r\nthem with land,\" Auguste said. \"But whether it is legal or illegal, just\r\nor unjust, I can't help you to move my people or any other red people\r\noff the land they are living on.\"\r\n\r\nJackson's face seemed to sharpen. \"You could have done much for Indians\r\nby working for me. I'm surprised that a man of your intelligence and\r\neducation would prefer running around in the woods wearing a loincloth.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste was reminded of Nancy's words, _hunting and living in wigwams_.\r\n\r\nJackson reached into an inner pocket of his black jacket and took out a\r\npair of spectacles. To Auguste they looked somewhat like Pierre's.\r\nAuguste thought with sorrow of Sun Woman and wondered what had happened\r\nto the spectacles he had given her. Jackson bent forward and picked up a\r\nsheet of paper from one of the piles on his desk.\r\n\r\n\"Ask one of the soldiers in the next room to help you find the rest of\r\nyour party.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA few days later Jefferson Davis came to see Auguste in his new room, a\r\nsmall wedge-shaped chamber in one of the towers of Fort Monroe.\r\n\r\n\"I see they've moved you,\" said Davis with a smile.\r\n\r\nAuguste nodded. \"I believe President Jackson prefers that I no longer\r\nassociate with Black Hawk and his party.\"\r\n\r\n\"Seems so,\" Davis said. \"President Jackson plans to send Chief Black\r\nHawk and Owl Carver and the Prophet on a tour of our big cities.\r\nJackson's up for reelection next month. And, of course, he wants Black\r\nHawk to see at first hand what he's up against. The President has made\r\nit clear that you are not to go along.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste shrugged. \"He offered me a position. I refused.\"\r\n\r\nA smile warmed Davis's pale, gaunt face. \"People don't ordinarily say no\r\nto the President of the United States. Well, you'll go home all the\r\nsooner. Black Hawk and the others won't get back to the Sauk reservation\r\nin Ioway till sometime next year. But I'm leaving tomorrow to rejoin\r\nZachary Taylor's command at Fort Crawford, and I'm to take you with me,\r\nto return you to your people.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste did not answer. He sat down heavily on his bed, which he had\r\npulled next to the one small window in his room, overlooking the strait\r\ncalled Hampton Roads.\r\n\r\nDid he want to go back to his people? He remembered a thought that had\r\ncome to him while talking with Andrew Jackson. Each man owning his own\r\nland. That was the key to the white way of life.\r\n\r\nBut he longed to see Redbird and Eagle Feather again. Were they well or\r\nsick? He wanted to hold Redbird in his arms, mourn Floating Lily with\r\nher. That wonderful story he had heard from Owl Carver about Eagle\r\nFeather and the calumet--he wanted to tell Eagle Feather he had done\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nBut, go back to the Sauk? He knew now, especially after talking to\r\nJackson, what the future of the Sauk would be. Never to see the Great\r\nRiver again. To lose their land bit by bit. To be confined to a tract of\r\nland in Ioway far smaller than the territory they'd formerly ranged\r\nover. Not permitted to hunt where they wished. Might have to beg food\r\nfrom an Indian agent, as Jackson had said. They would not choose their\r\nown chiefs as they always had, but would have chiefs picked for them by\r\nthe whites, men like He Who Moves Alertly, who knew how to use both the\r\npale eyes and their own people to advance themselves. A miserable life,\r\na prison life, a slave's life.\r\n\r\nMemories crowded his mind. The words of the Turtle: _You will be\r\nguardian of that land that has been placed in your keeping._ Sun Woman's\r\nlifeless brown eyes staring up at him at the Bad Axe. The charred ribs\r\nof Victoire under a three-quarter moon.\r\n\r\nHe thought of the endless acres of farm and grazing land stretching\r\naround Victoire. He remembered the verdict Not Guilty. The eyes of David\r\nCooper, hard but honest.\r\n\r\nIf he could take Victoire away from Raoul ...\r\n\r\nThen he would have something to offer Redbird and Eagle Feather. If he\r\nwon his rightful place in the world the whites were building, he could\r\nbring his wife and son to share it with him.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter?\" said Davis, breaking in on his thoughts. \"Doesn't\r\nthe idea of going back to your people make you happy?\"\r\n\r\nAuguste shook his head. \"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"What other choice do you have?\"\r\n\r\n\"I could do more for my people by staying in the white world. Not as\r\nJackson's Judas goat, but as master of Victoire.\"\r\n\r\nDavis took a step backward, astonished. \"Master of Victoire! Have you\r\nlost your senses, man? We barely got you out of Smith County alive.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you take me back there instead of to the Sauk in Ioway?\"\r\n\r\nDavis shook his head. \"I'm not authorized to do that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Am I still a prisoner?\"\r\n\r\n\"You're a guest of Uncle Sam. But that doesn't mean I can spend Uncle\r\nSam's money taking you anywhere you want to go.\" Davis frowned in\r\nthought. \"But I could turn you loose in Galena instead of taking you all\r\nthe way over to Ioway. That wouldn't make any difference, monetarily.\r\nNot that I'm ready to go along with this, but could you manage to make\r\nit to Victor from there?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll write to my grandfather and ask him to send a horse to Galena for\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n\"If your grandfather has any sense he'll tell you to get the hell across\r\nthe Mississippi to the Sauk reservation.\"\r\n\r\n\"My grandfather has a power of sense. But he also loves me and will want\r\nto see me again.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you show your face in Victor you'll be swinging from a tree limb\r\nbefore the sun sets.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not if I can take Raoul by surprise.\"\r\n\r\nDavis shook his head. \"This is wrong. I'm letting you go to your death.\"\r\n\r\nFrightened, seeing his plan through Davis's eyes, Auguste was tempted\r\nto change his mind. Yes, go back to Ioway, live safely in the warm heart\r\nof the tribe. Why face a mob of rifle-toting bullies led by Raoul? It\r\nwas hopeless. He would surely die.\r\n\r\nBut he saw again those rolling acres, the great house rebuilt, the\r\nwealth and what he could do with it. If he turned his back on that, he\r\nwould stunt the rest of his life with regret and longing.\r\n\r\nHe said, \"It's not suicide. I'm risking my life, yes. But if I don't try\r\nto right the wrong that has been done to me, life will not be worth\r\nliving.\"\r\n\r\nDavis sighed. \"A man has to stand up for what he believes in, even if it\r\nlooks like a lost cause. I guess that's what you and Black Hawk and all\r\nyour people have been doing all along.\"\r\n\r\nNow that Auguste was committed, fear came back. He'd have to face\r\nRaoul's men, dozens of them, alone. Even the Bear spirit could not give\r\nhim the strength and skill to do that.\r\n\r\nThere must be a way to meet Raoul alone. Ambush him? But that way, even\r\nif he succeeded in killing Raoul, the town and Raoul's friends would\r\nnever accept him as master of Victoire.\r\n\r\nThe man he'd just met, Andrew Jackson, was well known as a duelist. In\r\nhis years at Victoire Auguste had heard more than once of Raoul meeting\r\nmen in single combat. Pierre and Elysée had spoken with disgust of\r\nRaoul's dozen or more killings.\r\n\r\nA duel. That would be the way to do it. If he succeeded in killing Raoul\r\nin a duel, no one would try to stop him from retaking Victoire. With\r\nRaoul gone, his men would be leaderless.\r\n\r\nOf course, Raoul had killed many men and Auguste had killed none. But\r\nthe Bear spirit would fight on Auguste's side. And if he failed, he\r\nwould rather die fighting for what was rightfully his than spend his\r\nlife drinking the bitter water of defeat.\r\n\r\nA few days before he left Fort Monroe, Auguste persuaded Davis to let\r\nhim be allowed to walk on the parade ground at the same time as Owl\r\nCarver. A sadness came over him at the sight of the old shaman, a gray\r\narmy blanket thrown over his shoulders despite the warmth of the day,\r\nwalking with stiff steps across the grass. The heavy-lidded eyes did not\r\nlight up with recognition until Auguste came close to him.\r\n\r\nThen Owl Carver took both Auguste's hands in his, and Auguste noticed\r\nsomething he had never seen before. The sudden realization awed him.\r\n\r\n_His eyes look so much like those of the Turtle!_\r\n\r\nWondering how Owl Carver would think of what he was doing, he told him,\r\n\"I am going back to the pale eyes' town. Back to Star Arrow's home. I\r\nmean to try to take back the land from my uncle.\"\r\n\r\nOwl Carver closed those ancient eyes. He spoke after a moment's\r\nhesitation, and when he did his voice frightened Auguste. It was the\r\neerie singsong voice he used when he was prophesying for the tribe.\r\n\r\n\"When a man or woman suffers an injury too great for them to bear, an\r\nevil spirit is born in them, a spirit of hate. The evil spirit ruins\r\nwhoever harbors it. The evil spirit occupies a man and drives him onward\r\nuntil he does things to others that make them hate in their turn, and\r\nthus the spirit continues. I think your uncle has been carrying such an\r\nevil spirit.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste broke out in a cold sweat hearing the warning in Owl Carver's\r\nwords. He remembered the hatred that rose in him whenever he thought of\r\nRaoul. Was the spirit of hatred kindled in Raoul at Fort Dearborn now\r\npassing to him?\r\n\r\n\"I pledged to my father, smoking the sacred tobacco, that I would hold\r\nthe land he gave me,\" Auguste said, as much to hearten himself as to\r\npersuade Owl Carver. \"Tobacco bound you and Black Hawk in honor to\r\nsurrender when Eagle Feather smoked it. I must honor my promise.\"\r\n\r\nBut he still felt cold within, as Owl Carver, his eyes now clear-sighted\r\nand grave, gripped his wrist tightly. \"Do not let your uncle's evil\r\nspirit cross over to you. See that it be your promise, and not greed,\r\nlike the greed of the pale eyes, that takes you back to that land. And,\r\nabove all, do not use your shaman's power to harm your enemy, or you\r\nwill suffer for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will not,\" said Auguste, but he felt unsure of himself. After all the\r\nevil he had endured, how could he _know_ that he would not unleash his\r\ngreatest powers if that were the only way he could destroy Raoul?\r\n\r\nThe grip of the bony fingers on his wrist tightened. \"Set your heart,\r\nWhite Bear, not upon getting back this land, but just upon walking your\r\npath.\"\r\n\r\nThe deep lines in Owl Carver's face were drawn downward with pain, and\r\nAuguste felt the crushing weight of grief as he realized they were both\r\nthinking the same thought--that they would never see each other again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n24\r\n\r\nChallenge\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing the dimly seen figures of Guichard and his horse, Auguste\r\nbreathlessly climbed a narrow, steep pathway that switched back and\r\nforth up the steep, wooded hillside. He led his horse by the reins.\r\nHalfway up the hill they came to a flat place, an open clearing. Auguste\r\nsmelled wood smoke. The windows of a cottage glowed yellow, promising\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\nWhile Auguste waited in the dark, Guichard stabled the horses, then\r\nknocked on the cottage door.\r\n\r\n\"We have arrived, monsieur,\" he called, and pushed the door inward.\r\n\r\nAuguste blinked in the light of a dozen candles set on a circular\r\nchandelier. Across the room by the fireplace a book fell to the rug, a\r\nKentucky quilt was swept back and a pair of long, skinny legs draped in\r\na nightshirt swung over the side of a chaise longue.\r\n\r\n\"Grandpapa, don't get up.\" But Elysée was already hobbling across the\r\nroom to Auguste's outstretched arms.\r\n\r\nElysée buried his white head in his grandson's chest. Auguste held his\r\ngrandfather tightly; the answering embrace was not as strong as it had\r\nbeen even a few months ago when the old man had visited him in his cell.\r\nThe fragility and weakness saddened Auguste.\r\n\r\nBare feet peeping from under another nightshirt pattered down a ladder\r\nfrom the second-story loft. Before he reached the bottom, Woodrow jumped\r\nand rushed to hug Auguste.\r\n\r\n\"I been staying here ever since we found out you were coming. So I could\r\ntell Miss Nancy right away when you got here.\"\r\n\r\nNancy. His heart raced as he remembered her in the witness chair\r\ndefending him and standing up to Raoul's abuse. He badly wanted to see\r\nher, to hold her in his arms.\r\n\r\nBut could he allow himself to feel so much for Nancy, when he hoped to\r\nbring Redbird here?\r\n\r\n_That is looking too far down the trail. I may not live to see Redbird\r\nagain._\r\n\r\nOut there in the dark the enemy might be gathering even now.\r\n\r\n\"You still live with Miss Nancy, Woodrow?\"\r\n\r\n\"She's adopted me.\" The boy stared down at Elysée's small Chinese rug.\r\n\"I guess that makes me your son too.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste understood what Woodrow meant. Auguste had taken Nancy as his\r\nwife according to Sauk custom, and Woodrow knew it. He saw Elysée's\r\npuzzled look, and knew that he might have difficulty explaining later.\r\nBut he must not hesitate now. He squeezed Woodrow's bony shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"I'm proud.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm proud of you, White Bear. I'm glad you came back. I'm off to Miss\r\nNancy's soon as I get my britches on.\" The boy scampered back up the\r\nladder.\r\n\r\n\"Guichard, go get Nicole and Frank,\" said Elysée as he drew Auguste\r\nacross the room and gently pushed him into a chair.\r\n\r\n\"They'll be sleeping, Grandpapa,\" Auguste protested.\r\n\r\n\"They would be furious if we did not wake them,\" said Elysée, his\r\nfalcon's face severe. \"And it is safest that we meet late at night.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste wondered, was any time safe? Did not the enemy have eyes and\r\nears for the night?\r\n\r\nAuguste threw off the riding coat Guichard had given him in Galena and\r\nsat down in a straight wooden chair by the chaise longue, close to the\r\nwelcome warmth of the fire. He noticed a pistol and a rifle mounted on\r\nbrackets over the mantel, with two powder horns hanging beside them.\r\nGuichard filled three small glasses with an inch of brandy apiece,\r\ndrained one quickly and left the other two and the decanter on a small\r\ntable within easy reach.\r\n\r\n\"I felt ten years younger when I saw Raoul's face turn purple when he\r\ncame into court with his rogues and heard that you had been spirited\r\naway.\" Elysée wiped his wet cheeks with a blue kerchief. \"I cry so\r\neasily. I _am_ getting old.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am crying, too, Grandpapa.\"\r\n\r\nElysée turned a stern but still moist eye on him. \"Enough crying, then.\r\nTell me everything you have seen and done since the trial.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste described his journey to Washington City and the meeting with\r\nAndrew Jackson.\r\n\r\nWoodrow, dressed now for riding, lingered to listen as Auguste repeated\r\nBlack Hawk's speech to Jackson. Then he solemnly shook hands with\r\nAuguste and left.\r\n\r\n\"Be careful out there,\" Auguste called after him.\r\n\r\nElysée said, \"President Jackson, what sort of man is he?\"\r\n\r\n\"His nickname, Old Hickory, is apt. He's hard, very hard.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste told about his refusal of Jackson's offer of a post and being\r\ncut out of Black Hawk's touring party.\r\n\r\nElysée shook his head doubtfully. \"To take a position in the government\r\nmight have opened up an excellent career for you.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste shook his head. \"I knew what Jackson wanted to use me for. The\r\nBear spirit would tear my heart out if I ever consented.\"\r\n\r\nElysée raised an eyebrow. \"You still believe in such things--bear\r\nspirits and all that?\"\r\n\r\nAuguste thought of his resolve to succeed as a white man. Even so, the\r\nBear spirit was as real as his grandfather.\r\n\r\n\"I don't just believe, Grandpapa. I know.\"\r\n\r\nElysée's reply was cut off when a weeping Nicole pushed the door open,\r\nfollowed by Frank and Guichard. Auguste held his aunt in his arms,\r\nrejoicing in the strength he felt in her ample body. Guichard brought\r\nmore chairs from a rear room and set them close to the fire. They sat in\r\na circle, their backs to the dark outside.\r\n\r\n\"All this going from house to house isn't safe,\" said Nicole. \"Raoul is\r\nprobably having all of us watched. He won't feel he really owns Victoire\r\nas long as Auguste is alive.\"\r\n\r\nFrank said, \"He might know that President Jackson sent you back from\r\nWashington City. We've been getting regular reports from back East about\r\nChief Black Hawk's tour, and your name wasn't mentioned.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you have any news about the rest of my people?\" Auguste asked.\r\n\r\nNicole said, \"The Sauk prisoners who walked through here are being held\r\nat Rock Island.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste said, \"I must go there and find Redbird and Eagle Feather.\"\r\n\r\nHearing that she was still in Illinois, he wanted more than ever to\r\nrescue her from hunger and fear and captivity, to bring her and Eagle\r\nFeather here to Victoire.\r\n\r\n_If I live to do that._\r\n\r\n\"Will you join the other Sauk in Ioway after you find your family?\"\r\nFrank asked.\r\n\r\nAuguste shook his head. \"No, I must take my rightful place here. I can\r\nno longer live as a Sauk. If we are to live and prosper, we must live as\r\nthe whites do, each man holding and tending his own land. I want to show\r\nmy people how it can be done. I want to take Victoire back.\"\r\n\r\nA silence filled the room. A log on the fire broke in two with a loud\r\ncrack, spattering sparks on the screen.\r\n\r\nAuguste looked at each of them in turn. There was worry in Elysée's\r\neyes. Nicole's full face was pale with fear, and Frank looked\r\nbewildered. Guichard, standing against the wall, sipped brandy.\r\n\r\nFrank said, \"But Raoul--he'll try to kill you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean to let him try. I mean to challenge him.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can't.\" Nicole's voice was shrill. \"He's got dozens of men behind\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\"He will have to fight me man to man. Raoul can hold his place only as\r\nlong as his followers think he is the strongest and bravest. They don't\r\nrespect him the way they used to. He made too many mistakes. And some of\r\nthose mistakes have cost lives among his own men. If he tries to kill me\r\nwithout fighting me, he'll slip further in their eyes. If he loses the\r\nrespect of his men, he loses everything.\"\r\n\r\nNicole said, \"But you're going up against someone who has killed many\r\ntimes.\"\r\n\r\n_True. And he killed Iron Knife, the biggest and strongest brave in the\r\nBritish Band._\r\n\r\n\"I must do this,\" said Auguste. \"I have never killed, but I know how to\r\nuse weapons. I must do it for my mother. For all the Sauk that he has\r\nkilled. And so that my father's will may be done. I believe the Bear\r\nspirit will help me.\"\r\n\r\nHe hoped he sounded more confident than he felt. If he let these people\r\npersuade him, he might give up and run away.\r\n\r\nElysée groaned. \"The Bear spirit again. Auguste, think how many men have\r\ngone into battle believing God and the saints and the angels would help\r\nthem. And have died.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste wished he could explain. Maybe for white men the spirits did not\r\nexist. But he knew that his visions were real. The Bear spirit was not\r\njust another part of his mind. It had a life of its own. It had left the\r\nmarks of its claws on his body. It had left its paw print in the earth\r\nbeside Pierre's body when it took his spirit away.\r\n\r\n\"If it was wrong for me to try to fight Raoul, Grandpapa, I would\r\nreceive a warning.\"\r\n\r\nElysée shook his head sadly, disbelieving. Auguste was sad, too,\r\nthinking how much more there was to the world than Grandpapa would ever\r\nlet himself know.\r\n\r\nThe Seth Thomas clock on the mantel over the fireplace chimed once,\r\nmaking them all jump. One o'clock in the morning. Auguste, at the end of\r\na journey by railroad, steamboat, coach and horseback that had taken\r\nweeks, felt a bone-deep ache of exhaustion. But it was only bodily\r\nfatigue. Now that he was in Victor he was excited, and his mind was wide\r\nawake.\r\n\r\nFrank put an ink-stained hand on Auguste's shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Listen, Auguste. Even if you were to succeed in killing Raoul, you\r\nwouldn't get Victoire back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Things have changed around here. People don't hold with the idea that\r\nevery man should carry a gun and be a law unto himself. They've seen\r\nthat only leads to a gang like Raoul and his rogues running things.\r\nThey've decided they wanted the county run by those they've picked. And\r\nmen like David Cooper and Tom Slattery came forward. Slattery is our new\r\nsheriff.\"\r\n\r\nElysée said, \"The _Victor Visitor_ has had much to do with this change.\"\r\n\r\nFrank shrugged modestly and went on, \"Right after your trial a group of\r\nmen in Victor and on the farms hereabouts, mostly newcomers, formed an\r\norganization called the Regulators. They said it was a disgrace that the\r\nArmy had to guard you during your trial and that you had to flee from\r\nthe town when it was over. They're determined to keep order in Smith\r\nCounty, and Slattery has sworn them all in as deputies to make what they\r\ndo legal. Things are tense now between the Regulators and Raoul's men,\r\nbut the Regulators have more numbers and more spirit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well then,\" said Auguste, exasperated, \"why wouldn't these Regulators\r\nsupport me if I kill Raoul?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because dueling is against the law. You'd stand trial again, for\r\nmurder. And, by God, much as it might pain him, Cooper will hang you.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if you don't kill Raoul,\" said Nicole, \"you'll die and he will\r\nstill have Victoire.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste felt as if he were struggling in a net of heavy ropes. His hands\r\nand heart ached for revenge on Raoul. Even if he did not get Victoire\r\nback.\r\n\r\nBut that was madness, to kill Raoul and be hanged for it.\r\n\r\n\"What can I do, then?\" he asked in a low voice.\r\n\r\nNicole said, \"David Cooper still has the papers that prove Pierre\r\nadopted you and left Victoire to you.\"\r\n\r\nFor just a moment Auguste felt his burden of fear grow lighter. He would\r\nfight Raoul in a courtroom. No one need die.\r\n\r\nBut no--he waved the idea away.\r\n\r\n\"They acquitted me of murder, but a jury of new settlers in Illinois is\r\nnot likely to make an Indian the biggest landholder in the county.\"\r\n\r\nNicole said, \"They would, because they would know that if they found for\r\nyou and against Raoul, they would be finding for the whole family, not\r\njust you.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste said, \"Even if I could get a fair trial, I wouldn't live to hear\r\nthe verdict.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you would,\" said Frank. \"Fear of the Regulators would stop Raoul\r\nfrom murdering you.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste felt the ropy net tightening. Three moons ago his life had been\r\nin the hands of twelve white men. Now Frank was asking him to trust\r\nunknown white men again. And again, it seemed, he had no choice.\r\n\r\n\"Is there nothing else I can do?\" The words came out as a cry of pain.\r\n\r\n\"You said you want to live as whites do,\" said Frank. \"Then you have to\r\nstart to think and act like a civilized white man. Seek your remedy in\r\nthe law.\"\r\n\r\nMore than once, Auguste thought, he'd seen that civilized white men were\r\nas quick to flout the law as to seek a remedy in it. But, resigned, he\r\nslumped in his chair, his hands hanging down between his knees.\r\n\r\n\"I will follow your advice.\"\r\n\r\nNicole came over to him and stroked his hair. \"We'll be beside you every\r\nmoment, Auguste.\"\r\n\r\nThe menace of rope or bullet or knife seemed driven off a bit, as\r\nGuichard put another log on the fire and they began to talk about going\r\nto Vandalia, finding a lawyer--perhaps Thomas Ford again--and filing\r\nsuit against Raoul. There was still the possibility--the likelihood--of\r\nfailure. But at least he might come through alive.\r\n\r\nThe clock struck two.\r\n\r\nA sharp banging on the door startled Auguste. Everyone fell silent,\r\ndreading what might be out there.\r\n\r\nGuichard went to the door, opened it a crack, then pulled it wide.\r\n\r\nAuguste saw a flash of blond hair under a bonnet and eyes of deepest\r\nblue. The sudden leap of his heart lifted him out of his chair. He\r\nbarely heard the little serving table beside him topple over, spilling\r\nhis brandy.\r\n\r\nHe ran to Nancy, holding out his arms.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe lenses on the desk stared accusingly up at Raoul.\r\n\r\n_Why do I keep taking them out and looking at them?_\r\n\r\nIt was like picking at a scab, making it bleed over and over again, so\r\nthat the wound never healed.\r\n\r\nWith a gentle hand he closed the silver case. He had long since cleaned\r\nand polished it, but he still remembered it as he had first seen it,\r\nstreaked with the blood of the Indian woman he had just killed. He put\r\nthe case in his desk drawer.\r\n\r\nArmand Perrault, sitting across the desk from Raoul, grunted with\r\ndisgust.\r\n\r\nIgnoring him, Raoul picked up his whiskey glass and sipped from it,\r\nrunning the tip of his tongue over the ends of his mustache.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you get rid of those damned spectacles?\" Armand said as he\r\nrefilled his glass from Raoul's jug.\r\n\r\nWhen Armand picked up his glass it left a wet ring that would stain the\r\npolished maple surface. There were already many rings on the desk, even\r\nthough it had been shipped out from Philadelphia only two months ago.\r\nThey looked like owl's eyes, staring as the spectacles stared.\r\n\r\nBut Raoul couldn't bring himself to care about how his desk looked,\r\njust as he couldn't care enough to get started on rebuilding Victoire.\r\nHe preferred to live at the trading post. He hadn't felt like doing\r\nanything, ever since Auguste's second escape from Victor. Next spring,\r\nhe told himself, he'd get the work going.\r\n\r\nAnd so he sat up late every night in his counting room with Armand and\r\nthey drank and told each other the same stories about the war with Black\r\nHawk's band. There were men to drink with in the trading post taproom,\r\nbut he didn't care for most of them. Armand had been with him longer\r\nthan anybody. Raoul might not like him much, but he was used to him.\r\n\r\nArmand had grudgingly accepted Raoul's explanation that he hadn't read\r\nhis copy of the will carefully before sticking it in the fire. He\r\nthanked Raoul for the belated two hundred dollars and dismissed Pierre's\r\ngenerosity as an attempted bribe from beyond the grave.\r\n\r\nRaoul stared at his stained desk. The drawer was still open, the silver\r\ncase still visible. \"They were my brother's spectacles.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know that. Why do you keep them? You hated your brother.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul brought the flat of his hand heavily down on the desk. \"Shut up!\r\nYou know nothing about it.\"\r\n\r\n_How do I feel about Pierre? Do I still love him in a way? Is that why I\r\nkeep his spectacles?_\r\n\r\nUnwilling suddenly to consign the silver case to his desk, he dropped it\r\ninto his jacket pocket. Armand probably wanted him to throw it away so\r\nhe could retrieve the case and sell it for the silver.\r\n\r\nArmand said, \"Your brother put the horns on me. And his Injun friends\r\nkilled my wife. Mon Dieu, how I wanted to see that bastard son of his\r\nhang for that!\"\r\n\r\nRaoul was tired of hearing Armand go on about dead Marchette, to whom\r\nhe'd given nothing but blows and contempt when she was alive. Going to\r\nbed with Pierre was the only good thing that ever happened to that poor\r\nwoman. But he said nothing; after all, he himself had cared little\r\nenough for Clarissa when she was alive.\r\n\r\n\"You'll get a chance to kill him yet,\" said Raoul. \"He'll be back this\r\nway.\"\r\n\r\nIt was now nearly a week since the sergeant at Fort Crawford in Raoul's\r\npay passed the word that Andrew Jackson had sent the mongrel back West.\r\nTo think, that vermin meeting the President!\r\n\r\nIf Auguste traveled as fast as the news, he must be nearly here. Raoul's\r\ninformant said that Auguste was supposed to be sent with a military\r\nescort to the new Sauk reservation in Ioway. Raoul was sure Auguste\r\nwould come to Victor instead.\r\n\r\nWhen Auguste came back to Victor, he would go at once to Nancy Hale's\r\ncabin, or send for her. Surely she had lied in court about what she and\r\nAuguste were to each other. The boys Raoul had sent to watch her cabin\r\nwould let him know of Auguste's arrival.\r\n\r\nArmand nodded vigorously. \"May le Bon Dieu grant me the chance to kill\r\nhim. But what makes you so sure he will come here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because he knows that he can prove Pierre left Victoire to him. Cooper\r\nhas those papers, and Cooper helped him escape, so he has Cooper on his\r\nside.\"\r\n\r\nArmand said, \"Two pieces of paper. Easy enough to make them disappear.\"\r\n\r\n\"How in hell am I going to get them away from Cooper? Him and his\r\nRegulators.\"\r\n\r\nGlowering at Raoul, Armand leaned back in his chair, making it creak. He\r\nfolded his hands across the big belly that stretched his homespun shirt.\r\n\r\n\"Kill Cooper and there will be no more Regulators.\"\r\n\r\n_How I wish I could._\r\n\r\nPouring himself another drink, Raoul said, \"Armand, you're damn near as\r\nstupid as an Indian.\"\r\n\r\nArmand's eyes narrowed and for a moment Raoul saw a flash of hatred that\r\nreminded him of the way the overseer used to look at Pierre.\r\n\r\n\"Have a care how you talk to me, mon colonel,\" Armand said in a voice\r\nthat sounded like millstones grinding together, \"I am your one friend.\r\nOtto Wegner and Eli Greenglove turned on you, Hodge Hode is dead, Levi\r\nPope has joined the Regulators.\"\r\n\r\n_It's true. I have no other friends but Armand. I have no family. What's\r\nhappened to me?_\r\n\r\n\"Damn it, it _is_ plain stupid to talk about fighting the Regulators,\r\nArmand. Kill Cooper and we'd have a countywide war on our hands.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe we could frighten the Regulators into backing down, mon\r\ncolonel--if _we_ showed some courage.\"\r\n\r\n_That's a jab at me._\r\n\r\nWhiskey and anger almost made Raoul lash out again at Armand, but he\r\nfelt a sudden fear that Armand would turn on him and he would be all\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nRaoul brooded for a time, then finally spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Wait till I get the lead mine opened up next spring. We'll go up to\r\nGalena, you and I, and we'll recruit the roughest, meanest miners we can\r\nfind. And we'll make it plain to them that they'll have two jobs--to dig\r\nfor lead and to fight Regulators. When we've got enough of them down\r\nhere, we'll take on Cooper and his crowd in the next election. I'll\r\nspread whiskey and money around and our boys will beat up anybody who\r\nsays he won't vote our way. Smith County will belong to us again,\r\nArmand.\"\r\n\r\nHe heard hurried footsteps echoing on the split-log floor of the fort's\r\nmain room. Someone rapped on his office door. Like a swimmer coming up\r\nfrom the bottom of a lake after a dive, Raoul rose up out of his\r\ncomfortable whiskey haze.\r\n\r\n\"Who's there?\" he growled.\r\n\r\nJosiah Hode, a skinny, red-haired youth in dark calico shirt and\r\nworkman's trousers, a big hunting knife at his waist, pushed the door\r\nopen. Hodge's orphaned son.\r\n\r\n_This is what my Andy and Phil would have grown to look like._ The\r\nthought hurt Raoul because Andy and Phil were dead and because he had\r\nnever really loved them.\r\n\r\n\"What is it, Josiah?\"\r\n\r\n\"Someone rode up to Miz Hale's door and banged on it. I snuck right up\r\nto the fence. When they came out I saw it was that Woodrow kid that\r\nlives with her. And she got out her own horse and rode toward town with\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you follow them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Long enough to see that they went up to old Mr. de Marion's place.\"\r\n\r\n\"_He's_ there!\" Raoul said. He felt as if he were out hunting on a\r\nfrosty morning and had just sighted a buck with spreading antlers. He\r\nclenched his fist and brought it down on his desk, hard. He opened the\r\ndrawer again, took out a small bag of coins and slammed the drawer shut.\r\n\r\nHe counted out nine Spanish dollars. \"Josiah, you divide these between\r\nthe three of you for keeping good watch.\" He dropped a tenth piece of\r\neight into the boy's cupped hands. \"That's for you, for bringing me the\r\ngood news.\"\r\n\r\nJosiah grinned, all teeth. \"Thanks a heap, Mr. de Marion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Armand, I want about twenty men. Go round them up. Have them meet me at\r\nthe trading post gate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Très bon, mon colonel.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul thought a moment. He had planned to hang Auguste, but they\r\ncouldn't leave a body around for the Regulators to find.\r\n\r\n\"We'll take him out to the lead mine and finish him there. I know parts\r\nof that mine where nobody'll ever find anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can I come, Mr. de Marion?\" Josiah asked. The glow of admiration in his\r\neyes warmed Raoul.\r\n\r\nRaoul gave the boy a grin. \"Sure, Josiah. Bring your dad's rifle. I'll\r\nshow you how Smith County takes care of its Indian problem.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Do Nicole and Grandpapa know about us?\" Auguste asked Nancy as they sat\r\nside by side on the split-rail fence Guichard had built around Elysée's\r\ngarden.\r\n\r\n\"I told Nicole,\" she said. \"I was afraid she'd condemn me, but I had to\r\nconfide in someone. She was very sweet to me about it, not a hint of\r\nreproach.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nicole understands.\" His voice sounded choked. He didn't know how he\r\nknew Nicole that well--from glances, from hints in her voice\r\nperhaps--but he was sure that her own desires were as large as she was.\r\nAnd her generosity larger still. She would feel nothing but goodwill\r\ntoward another woman's longing for a man.\r\n\r\nNancy put her hand on Auguste's, and his breath quickened. Her face\r\nseemed to pull his eyes, and he saw, in the light of the waxing moon,\r\nthat she was more beautiful tonight than he had ever seen her. Her\r\ncheeks were rounder now: he hadn't fully realized how haggard she had\r\nbeen as a captive of the Sauk.\r\n\r\n_We all looked like buzzards' meals. But even then I loved to look at\r\nher._\r\n\r\nRight now he felt the blood throbbing in his body. He wanted to pick her\r\nup and carry her into the woods beyond the house and be upon her. As any\r\nhealthy Sauk husband and wife would greet each other after a long time\r\napart. He was so aware of his hunger for Nancy and hers for him that he\r\ncould hardly think of anything else. Their need lit up the little\r\ngarden with a glow brighter than the moon's.\r\n\r\nBut what of Redbird? Even though she accepted Nancy as truly his wife,\r\nas much as herself, somehow it did not seem right for him to love Nancy\r\nnow. It had been right when they were living with the British Band; here\r\nin Victor it was not right.\r\n\r\n\"I knew you would come back,\" Nancy said, sensing his desire but not his\r\nhesitancy, bringing her lips so close to his he could almost taste them.\r\n\r\nHe inched away from her, so as not to be utterly overcome by her\r\nnearness.\r\n\r\nHe decided to talk of other things. He told her of the plan he had come\r\nhere with, to challenge Raoul. He told her how Frank had persuaded him\r\nto try to retake Victoire with the law's help.\r\n\r\n\"The Turtle has said that I must be guardian of the land and see to it\r\nthat no pale eyes prospers by stealing from the Sauk,\" he said. \"If I\r\ncan take Victoire back from Raoul, my people will have a place to come\r\nto in the land that was once theirs.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean for the tribe to come back and live on the estate?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, they could never come back to Illinois as a tribe. But families\r\ncould come and live here for a while--they could send their children\r\nhere--they could learn our ways. And the wealth of the estate could help\r\nthem, wherever they might be.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you bring Redbird and Eagle Feather here?\" she asked, squeezing\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\n_Does she want me to say I won't? No, she cares for them too. We were a\r\nfamily._\r\n\r\nHe said, \"Yes, if I can get Victoire away from Raoul, I will bring them\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\nHe saw her eyes close and knew that he was hurting her, and that\r\ndeepened his own pain still more.\r\n\r\nShe let go his hand and twisted her fingers together in her lap. \"Of\r\ncourse Redbird is first in your heart. But how can she live here with\r\nyou? Where her baby was torn out of her arms and killed by a mob of\r\nwhite people.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've asked myself that many times. I will have to hear what Redbird\r\nsays.\"\r\n\r\nHe remembered what Sun Woman had said when Pierre asked her to come with\r\nhim to Victoire. _I could not look into pale eyes faces all day long.\r\nMy heart would dry up._ And surely Redbird had more reason to hate the\r\nsight of white faces than Sun Woman had seven years ago.\r\n\r\nCould he himself live here? He talked about retaking Victoire, about\r\nliving as a white man, but he recalled the heaps of dead he had seen on\r\nthat blood-soaked island off the Bad Axe River. Could he live among the\r\npeople who had done that?\r\n\r\nNancy said, \"Would you still want to live at Victoire if Redbird said\r\nshe would not come with you?\"\r\n\r\nHe saw Redbird's small face, her slanting eyes, the fringe of black hair\r\nthat fell over her forehead. He felt her slender arms around him as they\r\nhad held him so many nights in their wickiup. He saw the love and fear\r\nin Eagle Feather's eyes when they parted so that he could take Nancy and\r\nWoodrow to safety. The pain of being away from them almost made him want\r\nto weep.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know the answer to that. The trail I follow is dark. I must go\r\none step at a time.\"\r\n\r\nThe chill night air carried a sound to his ears. Off in the distance, on\r\nthe bluff south of this hill, a man's low voice spoke a few words, then\r\nanother voice answered. He heard a boot crunch on gravel. A door slam.\r\n\r\nThe hair on the back of his neck lifted.\r\n\r\nHe raised his head, and his ears felt as if they were opening wider, to\r\ntake in everything that came to him. The noises were all faint; no pale\r\neyes would even have noticed them.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" said Nancy.\r\n\r\nThe sounds seemed to come from the town. Who would be up so long after\r\nmidnight?\r\n\r\n\"Some men talking, a long way off.\" He listened for the space of a few\r\nbreaths. \"I don't hear anything now.\"\r\n\r\nVictor, he decided, was making him overly fearful.\r\n\r\nNancy said, \"If Redbird does come to live with you, what will become of\r\nyou and me?\" She took his hand in both of hers, stroking his fingers. \"I\r\nlove you, Auguste. Now more than ever. Before, my life depended on you.\r\nNow I know that I love you of my own free will.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I love you, Nancy.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you love Redbird too. More than me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not more than you. In another way. Sometimes I seem to be two people.\"\r\n\r\n\"Among the Sauk you could have both me and Redbird as wives. And when I\r\nwas a captive, and I thought I might die at any time without ever having\r\nloved you, then I accepted your way. But if Redbird lived here, you and\r\nI would have to be together in secret. And I couldn't live my whole life\r\nthat way.\"\r\n\r\nHe had known it would hurt like this. This was the very reason he had\r\ntried again and again to renounce Nancy's love.\r\n\r\n\"I understand,\" he said, and the words seared his throat.\r\n\r\n_But now I would never give up a moment I spent with her, even to escape\r\nthis pain._\r\n\r\nHe ached to put his arms around Nancy and to feel her holding him. But\r\nhe made himself sit rigid, fingers digging into his thighs.\r\n\r\nNancy spoke, and he could hear the iron of grief in her voice. \"If\r\nRedbird comes here as your wife--I'll leave here. Maybe we'll go back\r\nEast. Woodrow and I.\"\r\n\r\nShe stopped abruptly, too choked by tears to speak. The fence rail they\r\nwere sitting on shook with her sobs.\r\n\r\nSomething broke inside Auguste, and he felt his eyes burn as the wetness\r\ntrickled down his cheeks. He slid from the fence and held out his arms\r\nto her.\r\n\r\n\"To see you again and hear you say you'll leave me forever,\" he said.\r\n\"It hurts too much.\"\r\n\r\nShe came into his arms, pressing her wet face against his. Her lips\r\ntwisted against his, burning, devouring. Her arms slid around him, her\r\nhands stroking his neck. He could feel her pulling at him as he held her\r\nand her legs gave way.\r\n\r\nHe knew they were going to have each other and could not help\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nHe pressed his hand on her breast, loving its softness, feeling her\r\nrisen nipple push against his palm through silk and calico.\r\n\r\nFootsteps crackled in the shrubbery at the bottom of the hill.\r\n\r\nHe froze, all his senses straining.\r\n\r\nThe hot blood in his veins turned in an instant to icy water.\r\n\r\n\"Auguste, for God's sake,\" she whispered.\r\n\r\n\"Someone's coming,\" he said. He felt her shiver against him.\r\n\r\nHe heard many men. They were trying to move quietly, filtering up the\r\nhill through the woods. But few pale eyes could walk unheard among\r\nshrubs and trees and piles of fallen leaves, especially at night.\r\n\r\nAlong with fear, he felt a sudden anger at himself that made him want\r\nto pound his fist on his head. He'd heard the voices before, farther\r\noff, in the village. He should have listened. He'd have known who and\r\nwhat they were.\r\n\r\nHis ears told him the approaching men had formed a semicircle, slowly\r\nclosing as they climbed toward Elysée's cottage. His heart fluttered in\r\nhis rib cage, skipping beats, then pounding hard.\r\n\r\nNancy seized his hand.\r\n\r\n\"God protect us, Auguste!\" she whispered. \"I hear them too. Your uncle\r\nmust have found out that you're here. You've got to get away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Into the house. Hurry.\"\r\n\r\nIn the front room of Elysée's cottage Frank and Nicole were sitting by\r\nthe embers of the fire. The others had gone to sleep. Nancy flew into\r\nNicole's arms.\r\n\r\n\"We've got to get word to the Regulators,\" said Frank when Auguste told\r\nhim about the men coming up the hill. He shook Woodrow, who had been\r\nnapping on the chaise longue.\r\n\r\n\"Go by way of the ravine on the other side of this hill,\" Frank told the\r\nboy. \"Tell Judge Cooper Raoul and his men are coming to kill Auguste.\"\r\nHe turned worried eyes on Auguste. \"Perhaps you'd better go with\r\nWoodrow. You'd be safe at Cooper's.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Auguste. \"If I run for it and they catch me, they'll surely\r\nkill me. I'm going to do what I came to do. When Raoul gets here, I will\r\nchallenge him.\" His heart pounded so hard that his voice shook.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, Auguste!\" Nancy cried.\r\n\r\nWoodrow stood hesitating by the door, listening.\r\n\r\n\"They're almost here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go!\" Frank snapped at him. Woodrow ran out.\r\n\r\n\"Go carefully, Woodrow,\" Nancy called after him.\r\n\r\n\"Challenging Raoul is just--just madness,\" said Frank. He went to the\r\nmantel and reached for Elysée's pistol.\r\n\r\n\"Frank, you can't!\" Nicole cried.\r\n\r\n\"What choice do we have?\" he said. He took one of the powder horns down\r\nand sat to load and prime the pistol.\r\n\r\nAuguste said, \"Frank, there are too many of them. If you try to fight\r\nthem you'll only fire that pistol once, and then you'll be dead.\"\r\n\r\nFrank said, \"In a few minutes Cooper and the Regulators will be here.\r\nAll we have to do is hold Raoul and his men off a bit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Please,\" Auguste said. \"Let me go out and meet Raoul alone.\"\r\n\r\nElysée said, \"Absolutely not.\" He stood in his long nightshirt in the\r\ndoorway of his bedroom. He gestured to Guichard, who had followed him\r\nout.\r\n\r\n\"Load my rifle, Guichard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Grandpapa, no!\" Auguste cried. He wanted to throw his arms around the\r\nold man and protect him.\r\n\r\nElysée shrugged. \"Perhaps as Frank says, we can face them down without\r\nshooting. You stay out of sight, Auguste. They cannot know for certain\r\nthat you are here.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will not let this happen,\" Auguste said. \"I'll leave now. I'll follow\r\nWoodrow.\" He strode to the door.\r\n\r\n_They could be out there._\r\n\r\n_If they are, then I can face Raoul as I first planned._\r\n\r\nHe yanked the door open and saw Raoul grinning at him, his face yellow\r\nin the candlelight from the cottage.\r\n\r\nAnd beyond Raoul, filling the clearing, a crowd of men with rifles.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRaoul couldn't see the mongrel's face. The light spilling out of\r\nElysée's house left Auguste in shadow. But he did see the split right\r\near, partly hidden by Auguste's long black hair. He hefted the\r\ncap-and-ball pistol held loosely in his right hand. This time there\r\nwould be no missing.\r\n\r\n_Now. Point the pistol and pull the trigger. He isn't even armed._\r\n\r\nBut behind Auguste, Raoul saw Frank Hopkins with a pistol and Papa with\r\na rifle. If he shot Auguste, he'd have no time to reload. They'd have\r\nthe drop on him. And even if they didn't shoot back, they'd be witnesses\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\nLooking past Frank he saw Nicole and Nancy Hale glaring at him,\r\nwide-eyed. At the sight of Nancy his jaw muscles clenched and his hand\r\ntightened on the pistol grip.\r\n\r\n_How could she turn away from me and take up again with that redskin\r\nbastard?_\r\n\r\n\"Come on out, mongrel,\" he said to Auguste. \"Maybe a jury found you not\r\nguilty, but we know you're guilty as hell. You sent that Sauk war party\r\nhere.\" He raised his voice. \"And you, Papa, Frank--you're fools to\r\ndefend him. His Indians were trying to kill you too.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste said, \"Raoul, you were the cause of the Sauk coming to Victor.\r\nYou are a liar and a fool and a coward. And a thief and a murderer.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste stepped forward and slapped Raoul's face.\r\n\r\nThe blow came too suddenly for Raoul to react. It wasn't even hard\r\nenough to hurt much. It was purely a gesture of contempt.\r\n\r\nThen Raoul's rage came. It flared up like a forest fire. He brought up\r\nthe pistol. Auguste's unprotected chest was less than a foot away.\r\n\r\nBut Auguste spoke again before Raoul could fire. \"Will you shoot an\r\nunarmed man now, Raoul? Go ahead, prove yourself a coward. When you took\r\nVictoire away from me, you wouldn't fight me. At Old Man's Creek--de\r\nMarion's Run--I stood before you with my hands empty, and then you tried\r\nto shoot me. You don't have the sand in you to face me fairly.\"\r\n\r\nRaoul sensed that Auguste's words were aimed not at him, but at the men\r\nbehind him. He felt angry, trapped.\r\n\r\n_Shoot, dammit! Shut him up._\r\n\r\n_No, it's too late. All these men heard what he said._\r\n\r\n\"You're afraid to fight me man to man. I challenged you the day you\r\ndrove me away from Victoire, and you backed down. I challenge you again,\r\nRaoul.\"\r\n\r\nAn answer sprang into Raoul's mind. \"I accept. Let the weapons be your\r\nneck and a rope.\"\r\n\r\nBut even as he spoke he had a sinking, uneasy feeling.\r\n\r\nHe did not hear any of his men laughing.\r\n\r\nArmand said, \"What the hell, Raoul. You've killed hundreds of Indians,\r\nsome of them a lot bigger than this one. Give him his duel.\"\r\n\r\nFor a moment Raoul felt like turning his pistol on Armand. The overseer\r\nwas paying him back, he realized, for the contempt he'd endured.\r\n\r\n\"I'm ready to meet you now or any time, mongrel. Let it be tonight. But\r\nwhere there will be no witnesses to charge the winner with murder.\"\r\n\r\nAuguste said, \"I would be a fool to trust you and your men.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have to,\" said Raoul. \"I'm not giving you any choice. The men will\r\nsee to it that it's a fair fight. That's what they want.\" He couldn't\r\nkeep the bitterness out of his voice. \"Come with us, or I'll shoot you\r\ndown on this doorstep.\"\r\n\r\nFrank Hopkins, pistol pointing at Raoul, crowded into the doorway beside\r\nAuguste.\r\n\r\nThe black O of the muzzle pointed at him chilled Raoul. He'd heard that\r\nFrank had fired on the Indians attacking the trading post. Seemed that\r\nday had changed him. Now he was a man like any other, taking up the gun\r\nlike any other.\r\n\r\nFrank said, \"Auguste is not going with you. There will be no duel. Get\r\naway from this house now.\"\r\n\r\nSeeing Frank's foolish defiance in the face of over twenty armed men,\r\nRaoul almost laughed.\r\n\r\nBut that pistol in Frank's hand could end his life. He couldn't shoot\r\nAuguste while Frank held it on him.\r\n\r\nRaoul swung the barrel of his own pistol to cover Frank's chest.\r\n\r\n\"Get back inside, Frank,\" he said, putting a steel edge into it.\r\n\r\nInstead, with a sudden movement that almost made Raoul squeeze the\r\ntrigger, Frank came forward, stepping in front of Auguste.\r\n\r\nRaoul saw another movement in the doorway, and then he was staring into\r\nhis father's glittering eyes. Elysée's rifle, long barrel trembling only\r\nslightly, was leveled at him.\r\n\r\nRaoul decided the best attack was to laugh at them. \"Look at the\r\nmongrel's protectors. A weakling who would never carry a pistol and a\r\nlame old man in his nightshirt.\"\r\n\r\nHe heard a few snickers among the men behind him and felt encouraged.\r\n\r\nBut, he thought with fury, he was still trapped. His pistol was aimed at\r\nFrank, but Frank's pistol and his father's rifle were both pointed at\r\nhim. If he shot Frank, would Elysée shoot him?\r\n\r\nWith the palm of his hand he pushed back the hammer of his cap-and-ball\r\npistol, the muzzle still aimed square at Frank's chest.\r\n\r\n\"Papa, Frank, both of you get out of the way, or Frank is a dead man.\"\r\n\r\nBut Raoul felt as if the bottom was dropping out of his stomach as he\r\nlooked at the two men. Neither Elysée nor Frank replied. Raoul saw\r\nresolution in Frank's light blue eyes. The man who had never wanted to\r\nkill was prepared to die.\r\n\r\n_I have to shoot first._\r\n\r\nHe heard Nicole scream as his finger tightened on the trigger.\r\n\r\nFrank and Elysée were pushed apart. Raoul was looking into Auguste's\r\neyes, blazing with a dark fire.\r\n\r\n_Kill the mongrel now, and you're done with him forever._\r\n\r\nHe squeezed the trigger hard. The hammer fell, and the pistol boomed and\r\nblossomed red fire and white smoke.\r\n\r\nThe pistol and the rifle pointed at Raoul both went off, hurling a\r\nblinding bitter cloud back into his face.\r\n\r\nHe stood unhurt.\r\n\r\nElysée and Frank had fired, but by pushing unexpectedly between them\r\nAuguste had spoiled their aim.\r\n\r\nThe smoke cleared. Raoul saw a black spot on the left side of Auguste's\r\nwhite shirt. In an instant it was a spreading scarlet stain.\r\n\r\nAuguste's eyes were shut. He fell back against Nicole, his knees buckled\r\nand he sagged to the ground. Nicole, her skirts billowing, threw her\r\narms around Auguste and eased him down.\r\n\r\nRaoul felt a surge of triumph.\r\n\r\n_At last! I killed the sonofabitch!_\r\n\r\nBut below the triumph, like chill black water under thin ice, lay fear\r\nof what might happen now. His knees trembled.\r\n\r\nRaoul saw Nancy Hale staring at him, her eyes full of hate.\r\n\r\n_Well, if I couldn't have you, he won't either._\r\n\r\n\"It was you led me to him, Nancy,\" he said, grinning as he saw her mouth\r\ntwist in anguish. \"When you came here, we knew he was here.\"\r\n\r\n\"I pray that you burn in Hell for all eternity, Raoul de Marion!\"\r\n\r\n\"Pretty talk for a minister's daughter,\" he laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Mon colonel!\" Armand called. \"We hear men running this way. Must be\r\nRegulators. Let us ambush them. We have time to find hiding places.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Raoul. \"We'd have to silence this bunch.\"\r\n\r\nHe gestured at Frank, Elysée, Guichard and Nicole, who were lifting\r\nAuguste's body into the house.\r\n\r\n_Will I truly have to stand trial for murder? Me? I never have before._\r\n\r\nHe stared into the empty doorway. Had he really finished Auguste? He'd\r\nbetter go in there and see. But there were three armed men in there, and\r\nif he had killed Auguste, nothing could stop them from trying to kill\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it might be a good idea to get away from here. With his family\r\nall fired up and the Regulators on the way, a very good idea.\r\n\r\nHe heard Nancy scream again and again. Nicole suddenly appeared in the\r\ndoorway.\r\n\r\n\"You are not my brother anymore, Raoul. I'll bear witness against you\r\nand so will Papa and Frank.\" She broke down and sobbed, then caught\r\nherself. \"You'll hang for this murder, and then, just like Nancy says,\r\nyou'll burn in Hell.\"\r\n\r\n_She says it is murder. Then the mongrel must be dead for certain._\r\n\r\nRaoul felt a vast relief. At last he had lifted from his shoulders the\r\nburden that had crushed them ever since Pierre brought the savage boy\r\nout of the forest.\r\n\r\nBut the relief lasted only for a moment. The fear came back. His legs\r\nwere still shaking. He wanted to run for it at once, to get a horse and\r\nride out of Smith County and keep going.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't just that he had killed a man. This killing was not like other\r\nkillings. This was not some nameless Indian or some river rat knifed in\r\na taproom brawl. This was his brother's son. The people in this house\r\nhad loved Auguste.\r\n\r\nHe remembered, and it was like something breathing cold on his neck, the\r\nfear he'd felt looking into Auguste's eyes at Fort Crawford. Medicine\r\nman. Was there some way Auguste could hurt him? Could Auguste, even in\r\ndeath, get at him?\r\n\r\nRaoul shook himself, shook off the haunting, frightening thoughts like a\r\ndog shaking off water.\r\n\r\nHe had never meant to shoot Auguste in front of witnesses. Now the\r\nRegulators were coming and they'd find the body in the house, and him\r\nwith the smoke practically still twisting up from his pistol barrel. And\r\nhe wasn't ready to fight them. The trial wouldn't last even as long as\r\nAuguste's had.\r\n\r\nHe had to go to ground somewhere until he could collect more men.\r\n\r\n_The lead mine._\r\n\r\nEven if they came there looking for him, he knew the mine so much better\r\nthan anyone in Smith County that they'd never find him. Only two or\r\nthree men who had worked the mine before the Indian war still lived in\r\nVictor, and they would not help the Regulators. In fact, he was sure he\r\nwas the only one who knew about some parts of the mine.\r\n\r\n\"Speak to us, mon colonel!\" Armand demanded. \"Do we fight?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Raoul. \"They outnumber us.\"\r\n\r\nHe pulled Armand to the edge of the clearing around Elysée's little\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to make a run. I can be out of the county by daybreak. I'll\r\ncome back in a couple of weeks, maybe a month. By that time things will\r\nquiet down, and I'll bring with me the men we need to run these\r\nRegulators out.\"\r\n\r\nLet them think he was going to ride straight out of the county. Let the\r\nRegulators chase him along the Checagou road, and the Galena road and\r\nthe Fort Armstrong road. Meanwhile, he'd hide out in the mine till they\r\nquit looking for him. Then he'd leave the county. But it would be best\r\nif no one at all knew exactly what he had planned.\r\n\r\n\"What will _we_ do, mon colonel?\" There was accusation in Armand's eyes.\r\nHe probably felt Raoul was deserting them. What the hell did Armand\r\nexpect him to do? He was doing the best he could for them; if he led\r\nthem into a fight he'd only get them killed.\r\n\r\nLike he'd gotten men killed at de Marion's Run and at the Bad Axe.\r\n\r\n\"For now, scatter. Deny you had any part in this. Wait for me to come\r\nback.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will not go easy for us, mon colonel,\" Armand growled.\r\n\r\n\"I'll be back,\" Raoul said. \"And when I am, it will be just like old\r\ntimes in Victor.\"\r\n\r\nHe plunged into the trees behind Elysée's house. While the Regulators\r\ncharged up the hill, he'd have no trouble finding his way back to the\r\ntrading post by moonlight.\r\n\r\nAlone, moving quickly through woods he'd known since boyhood, he felt\r\nsuddenly lighthearted. He might be on the run, but he'd done the most\r\nimportant thing. He'd killed Auguste. He had a winter to get through,\r\nmaybe a hard winter. But by next spring things would be back the way\r\nthey were in the days when he'd been happiest. Before he'd ever heard\r\nthat Pierre had a son. When he'd ruled like a king in Smith County.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n25\r\n\r\nThe Other World\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Nancy, young Dr. Surrey looked like a brainless clothier's mannequin\r\nin his black frock coat and ruffled white shirt. Though Woodrow had\r\nrouted him out of bed at nearly three in the morning and he had spent\r\nover an hour working on Auguste, he didn't seem tired. If he wasn't\r\ntired, what in God's name had he been doing? Now he was leaving, and\r\nAuguste was still unconscious.\r\n\r\nA helplessness in Surrey's face, round and blank as an unbaked pie\r\ncrust, turned Nancy's grief and fear into fury. She wanted to grab his\r\nshoulders and shake him until he promised that he could and would save\r\nAuguste.\r\n\r\n\"The bullet pierced his left lung,\" Surrey said. \"But it was a\r\nshoot-through, luckily, so I didn't have to dig in there and pull it\r\nout. Many a doctor has killed a pistol-shot man that way.\"\r\n\r\nNancy took a step toward the doctor. He was her only hope, and she would\r\nnot let him escape.\r\n\r\n\"Aside from not killing him, Doctor, what have you done for him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I packed the wound with cotton, front and back, to stop the bleeding. I\r\nput dressings on. I told Mrs. Hopkins how to change the cotton and\r\ndressings. And now he is in the hands of the Almighty.\"\r\n\r\n_Earthmaker, Auguste would say._\r\n\r\n\"I hope the Almighty guided _your_ hand, Doctor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Knowing your father was a man of the Lord, I'm sure your prayers for\r\nAuguste will be heard. He's got to stay where he is, in his\r\ngrandfather's bed, and fight for his life. I expect he'll take a fever,\r\nmaybe pneumonia. The punctured lung is of no use to him. He'll draw\r\nbreath with the other one. He'll be delirious, and you've got to get\r\nsome food into him--soup's the best, because he'll probably be able to\r\nswallow that. His body will fight while his mind sleeps. I'll be back to\r\nsee him every day.\"\r\n\r\nThrough tight lips she said, \"Tell me the truth, Doctor. Do you think\r\nhe'll get better?\"\r\n\r\n\"One man in four survives such a wound, Miss Hale.\"\r\n\r\nNancy's shoulders slumped. This man could do nothing more.\r\n\r\n\"Good night, then, Dr. Surrey.\"\r\n\r\nBack in the bedroom, Nancy could hear the crackling that was Auguste's\r\nbreathing, as blood bubbled in his pierced lung. His face beeswax-yellow\r\nin the candlelight, he lay under the canopy of Elysée's four-poster,\r\ncovered to his chest by a quilt. His arms lay stretched out on either\r\nside, his fingers slightly curled.\r\n\r\n_His breathing is so noisy, at least we'll know when he stops._\r\n\r\nNancy felt as if she herself were being swept away on a black tide of\r\nsorrow.\r\n\r\nElysée, sitting by the bed staring into his grandson's face, looked\r\nalmost as near death as Auguste. Guichard stood behind him, a clawlike\r\nhand perched on his master's shoulder.\r\n\r\nNicole, her eyes round and dark with suffering, asked, \"What can we do\r\nfor him?\"\r\n\r\nNancy said, \"The doctor says it's up to Auguste and God.\"\r\n\r\nElysée grunted. \"Where was God when this happened?\"\r\n\r\nIf Auguste were conscious, Nancy thought, he would be asking Earthmaker\r\nfor help. In the camps of the British Band Nancy had never seen Auguste\r\ngive up on a sick or wounded person. He had applied his remedies, gone\r\ninto his trance, danced and chanted to summon the aid of his spirit\r\nhelpers, wrestled with the hurt till either the man's soul left his body\r\nor the healing was well begun. At first his practices had seemed foolish\r\nand savage to her. But Auguste had done his work with such devotion that\r\nshe came, watching him, to love him all the more. And, out of love, to\r\nrespect what he did.\r\n\r\n_But he's not the only one who practices that calling._\r\n\r\nMaybe that was what he needed now. One of his own people to call on the\r\nspirits for him.\r\n\r\nIf only Auguste were awake, he could tell her what to do.\r\n\r\nRedbird had helped Auguste with his work.\r\n\r\nShe remembered the last time she had seen Redbird, small, emaciated,\r\nholding the broken body of Floating Lily in her arms. Redbird was\r\nprobably more in need of help than able to give it.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, Nancy had seen that she had a marvelous knowledge of healing.\r\nBesides, she had told Nancy that she wanted to be a shaman herself, like\r\nWhite Bear and Owl Carver.\r\n\r\nIt would be better to go to Redbird than sit here and watch Auguste die.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to his people,\" Nancy said. \"To find someone I think can help\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\"No Sauk will be willing to come here,\" said Frank. \"Not after what\r\nthese people did to them.\"\r\n\r\n\"This one will,\" said Nancy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA heavy, cold rain drummed on the leather top of Nancy's buggy. Driven\r\nby a sergeant, the little carriage splashed into the Sauk camp that\r\nhuddled beside the wooden walls of Fort Armstrong. A dozen peaked army\r\ntents, their grayish-white canvas sagging under the rain in a muddy\r\nfield, were all Nancy could see. There were no people in sight. \"I don't\r\nknow how you're going to find anybody here, ma'am,\" said the sergeant.\r\nNancy judged him to be a few years older than she was. His name was\r\nBenson. He had tomato-red cheeks and a blond mustache so thick that it\r\ncompletely hid his mouth.\r\n\r\nDark faces started to appear at the tent flaps. She wanted to weep as\r\nshe saw the misery of the women and children who slowly came out, some\r\nof them holding blankets over their heads, to stand in the mud and stare\r\nat her.\r\n\r\n_Shouldn't I be glad to see the Sauk brought so low?_\r\n\r\nDidn't she owe it to her father, Nancy asked herself, to rejoice\r\nin the fate of the people who had murdered him? And what about\r\nthe horrid things they'd done to her? So proud they'd been, the\r\nyellow-and-red-streaked faces, the feathers in their hair, the\r\nday Wolf Paw led them to burn and kill at Victor. Now they huddled,\r\nwhat was left of them, in the rain in a muddy field in tattered army\r\ntents.\r\n\r\nBut she felt no pleasure seeing the Sauk in final defeat. Through\r\nAuguste, they had become her people.\r\n\r\nShe felt suddenly uncomfortable sitting in the shelter of the buggy's\r\ntop, staring down at the sodden figures in the rain. If they could stand\r\nin the rain, she decided, she could too. She jumped down.\r\n\r\n\"Ma'am!\" the sergeant called, sounding alarmed. But he made no move to\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\nIn an instant her bonnet, her shawl, her dress, were all sopping. But\r\nshe didn't care, because the people she was looking at were soaked too.\r\nShe looked for familiar faces. The people standing before her seemed\r\nmade of mud. From head to foot they were a dull brown color.\r\n\r\n\"It is Yellow Hair!\" She understood the Sauk words and looked around to\r\nsee who had spoken, but all she saw were black eyes wide with sudden\r\nfear. Of course they all remembered her as the pale eyes woman who had\r\nbeen kidnapped and nearly killed, and who had escaped. They must think\r\nshe had come to accuse and punish.\r\n\r\nYes, now that they knew her, they were backing away, ducking into their\r\ntents.\r\n\r\n\"No--wait--\" Nancy cried. She wanted to tell them not to be afraid, but\r\ndidn't know how. Redbird was the only one she could talk to. And _fear_\r\nwas not a word Redbird had taught her.\r\n\r\nA man was standing in front of her. His eyes were empty, his face thin\r\nand dirty. He seemed familiar. He held out his hands. He seemed to be\r\nsaying, \"Here I am. Take me.\"\r\n\r\nAll at once Nancy recognized Wolf Paw.\r\n\r\nHis hair had grown out, hanging down in short black strands all around\r\nhis head. But at last she recognized that noble face that--much though\r\nshe'd hated him at first--had always reminded her of the engravings\r\nshe'd seen of Roman statues.\r\n\r\nShe understood what he was trying to tell her. If she'd come to find the\r\nmurderer of her father, the man who had kidnapped her, here he was. He\r\nwas at her mercy.\r\n\r\nHe seemed to have lost everything else, she thought, but not his\r\ncourage.\r\n\r\n\"Is that Injun threatening you, ma'am?\" called the sergeant from the\r\nshelter of the buggy.\r\n\r\n\"Not at all,\" she said, and smiled at Wolf Paw. She felt heartsick to\r\nsee how the splendid warrior had declined into a shabby spectre.\r\n\r\nShe tried to tell Wolf Paw, in the mixture of Sauk, English and gesture\r\nthat she had used with Redbird, that she had not come here to avenge\r\nherself on him, that all she wanted was to find Redbird.\r\n\r\nBut then Redbird was standing before her.\r\n\r\nLike Wolf Paw, she had changed so much that for a moment Nancy wasn't\r\nsure this _was_ Redbird. She was as thin as a fence rail, and those\r\ncolorful things Nancy remembered her wearing, the feathers and beads,\r\nthe dyed quills, the painted figures on her dress, all were gone. She\r\nclutched a coarse brown blanket around her shoulders. Her head was bare.\r\nWater dripped from the fringe of hair across her forehead and poured\r\nfrom her braids. She wore, not the doeskin clothing Nancy remembered,\r\nbut a torn gray cotton dress that was too big for her and dirty around\r\nthe bottom edge. Looking down, Nancy saw that Redbird's feet were bare,\r\nher toes sinking into the mud.\r\n\r\nNancy felt warm tears mingling with the cold rain on her face as she saw\r\nRedbird smiling at her.\r\n\r\n\"Redbird, I am glad to see my sister,\" Nancy said in their special\r\nlanguage. \"Where is your wickiup?\"\r\n\r\nRedbird spoke to Wolf Paw in Sauk words too low and rapid for Nancy to\r\nfollow. He grunted assent and trudged through the mud toward a distant\r\ntent. Watching him, Nancy felt pity at his rounded shoulders and old\r\nman's shuffle.\r\n\r\nRedbird beckoned Nancy to follow her to the tent she'd come from.\r\n\r\n\"Where you going, ma'am?\" the sergeant called.\r\n\r\n\"I'll be all right,\" Nancy called over her shoulder, raising her voice\r\nover the drumming of the rain. \"This is the woman I came to find.\"\r\n\r\nShe could see the young soldier shaking his head. Why would a young\r\nwhite woman go into the filthy, disease-ridden tents of these Indians?\r\n\r\n_May the Lord open his eyes and heart._\r\n\r\nAt first the inside of the tent seemed black as a moonless night to\r\nNancy, and the smell of damp, unwashed bodies made her stomach churn.\r\nShe took Redbird's hand and held it for reassurance. Not too tightly;\r\nthe bones felt delicate.\r\n\r\nRedbird explained that they had no dry wood for a fire. The long knives\r\nhad promised to bring them some, but they hadn't yet. The air was as\r\nchill in the tent as it was outside, and Nancy heard women and children\r\ncoughing.\r\n\r\nThey sat in silence for a time, Sauk fashion. Nancy's eyes adjusted to\r\nthe dim light filtering through the canvas till she could see Redbird's\r\nface. She saw Eagle Feather looking at her out of the shadows with huge\r\nblue eyes, a little skeleton whose covering of skin looked like\r\nstretched brown leather. Hurting inside, she greeted him with a pat on\r\nthe arm. If only she could do for him what she had done for Woodrow. Now\r\nshe could see four other women and two little girls huddled together\r\nnear the rear.\r\n\r\nNancy broke the silence. \"Redbird, White Bear needs you.\"\r\n\r\nWincing in pain, Redbird narrowed her slanting eyes. She asked what had\r\nhappened to White Bear.\r\n\r\nRedbird, Nancy learned, had heard no news of Auguste since the day he\r\nleft Black Hawk's camp to take Woodrow and Nancy back to the whites.\r\nAuguste had told Nancy that he had tried to get word to Redbird; now she\r\nsilently damned the soldiers for not bothering to pass the messages on.\r\nNo doubt they thought it not worth the trouble.\r\n\r\nWhen Nancy told Redbird that she had left White Bear four days ago,\r\nunconscious with a bullet wound in his chest, she saw the gleam of tears\r\non Redbird's cheeks.\r\n\r\n\"The pale eyes doctor says he can do no more,\" Nancy finished. \"You are\r\nthe only one who can help him now. You know the Sauk way of healing. You\r\ntold me you wanted to be a shaman.\"\r\n\r\nNo, Redbird said quietly, she _was_ a shaman. The declaration startled\r\nNancy.\r\n\r\n\"You told me the men wouldn't let you be one.\"\r\n\r\nIn their private language, Redbird said that for a long time she had not\r\nunderstood what it meant to be a shaman. She had thought that a shaman\r\nmust be made by another shaman. But now she knew that if people came to\r\na person for help, that person was a shaman. And people were coming to\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\"I have come to you,\" Nancy said. \"You can help White Bear.\"\r\n\r\nRedbird gave a helpless grunt that said she could not. The soldiers\r\nwould not let her leave.\r\n\r\nNancy reached into her handbag and drew out a folded paper. \"I have\r\nspoken with General Winfield Scott. This says that you may come with\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nRedbird sat in the damp straw looking down at her hands folded in her\r\nlap. Nancy waited anxiously for her to speak.\r\n\r\nAfter a moment, her voice full of pain and uncertainty, Redbird asked,\r\ndid White Bear _want_ to see her?\r\n\r\nThe question shocked Nancy. It had not occurred to Nancy that Redbird\r\nmight ever doubt Auguste's love for her.\r\n\r\nRecovering from her surprise, Nancy said, \"Before his uncle shot him,\r\nWhite Bear told me he was going to come here to find you and Eagle\r\nFeather. You are first in his heart, Redbird.\"\r\n\r\n_And, my God, how I wish it could be me!_\r\n\r\nRedbird looked sadly at Nancy. She was not first in White Bear's heart,\r\nshe said. That land that had been stolen from him was.\r\n\r\nShocked, Nancy started to blurt out a denial. But she realized she could\r\nnot. Auguste had gone to Victor before he went anywhere else.\r\n\r\n_But he is dying!_\r\n\r\n\"Do you want to save his life?\" Nancy asked.\r\n\r\nOh, yes, Redbird did, if Earthmaker would help her. In the shadows of\r\nthe tent Nancy could see the glint of tears on Redbird's cheek.\r\n\r\n\"Then you will come with me?\"\r\n\r\nRedbird lowered her pain-twisted face. Must she go back to the place\r\nwhere they killed her baby?\r\n\r\nAt the memory, Nancy broke into sobs and threw her arms around Redbird,\r\nas she had done that terrible day.\r\n\r\n\"I will always remember Floating Lily,\" Nancy said. \"I fought to save\r\nher. I thought she was my baby too.\"\r\n\r\nThey held each other in silence for a while, and then the thought came\r\nto Nancy that even a small delay might make the difference between\r\nAuguste's living and dying. Nancy felt a chill that ran deeper than the\r\ncold, damp air in the tent.\r\n\r\n\"Redbird, he will die if you do not come. You have to come.\"\r\n\r\nRedbird sighed. It was true; she would go with Yellow Hair.\r\n\r\nNancy's heavy heart felt a little lighter. If there was any hope at all\r\nfor Auguste, it lay with Redbird.\r\n\r\nOne thing they must take with them, Redbird told her. When they\r\nwere marching to this place, a soldier had taken White Bear's\r\ndeerhorn-handled knife from Redbird. It was the same soldier who had\r\ncome with Yellow Hair today, the one with the red face and the yellow\r\nmustache. It would be well if Yellow Hair could get it from him so they\r\ncould bring it back to White Bear. It would give him strength.\r\n\r\n\"I brought money with me,\" Nancy said. \"I will buy it back from him if I\r\nhave to.\"\r\n\r\n_I'll get it back from him if I have to kill him._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRedbird's eyes blurred as she stared at White Bear's face, as pale as\r\nthe moon. She wanted to scream, to throw herself weeping on his form.\r\nHer longing to see him open his eyes, to hear his voice, was so strong\r\nit hurt her. She remembered the night of his vision quest, when she was\r\nsure he would freeze to death. She thought of the summers they had been\r\napart, the nights they had lain together. She thought of poor, dead\r\nFloating Lily and of blue-eyed Eagle Feather, left in Wolf Paw's\r\nkeeping.\r\n\r\n_O come back to me, White Bear!_\r\n\r\nShe had never tried to heal anyone this close to death. When she and\r\nYellow Hair arrived, the grandfather said that White Bear had sometimes\r\nopened his eyes and spoken. But each day he had been awake a shorter\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nRedbird saw that White Bear was already wandering in the other world. A\r\nthread no stronger than a strand of spider's silk linked his spirit with\r\nhis body.\r\n\r\nShe let the love she felt for White Bear flow through her, giving her\r\nstrength. She felt the eyes of Yellow Hair, the grandfather and the old\r\nservant upon her, but she ignored them. She squatted down on the floor\r\nbeside White Bear's bed and unrolled the blanket in which she carried\r\nher medicines and supplies and the possessions White Bear had left with\r\nher at the Bad Axe.\r\n\r\nHer eye fell on the bundle of talking papers White Bear had cherished\r\nso, that he said was called something like \"The Lost Land of Happiness.\"\r\nThere was power in that bundle of words. Gently she laid it on his left\r\nside, near the wound. On his right she placed the knife that Yellow Hair\r\nhad been able to retrieve for her.\r\n\r\nArranging the three medicine bags on the floor, she took pieces of elm\r\nbark from the largest one and gave them to Yellow Hair.\r\n\r\n\"Make a tea for him from this. It will give him strength when he\r\nawakens.\"\r\n\r\nShe forced herself to turn her back on White Bear and go out of the\r\nhouse. With her she carried the blanket and the medicine bag adorned\r\nwith the beadwork owl. She crossed the little clearing around the house\r\nand entered the woods. Here, where no one could see her, she opened the\r\nmedicine bag and took out five tiny gray scraps of the magic mushroom.\r\nShe put them into her mouth and chewed and swallowed slowly.\r\n\r\nThen she got down on her hands and knees and spread her blanket. Oak,\r\nmaple and elm leaves, brown, red and yellow, lay thick on the ground.\r\nShe scooped leaves into the blanket. When she had gathered a big pile,\r\nshe bundled them up and went back into the house.\r\n\r\nCarefully she spread the leaves on the bed over White Bear's body. She\r\nheard the grandfather say something to Yellow Hair.\r\n\r\nYellow Hair spoke quietly to her, saying that the grandfather feared\r\nthat the leaves were not clean and would make White Bear sicker.\r\n\r\nHow could the leaves not be clean, Redbird wondered, when they came from\r\nthe woods, outside any dwelling?\r\n\r\nBut she answered, \"Must do what I know. If seem wrong to him, must do\r\nanyway, or can do nothing.\"\r\n\r\nShe heard Yellow Hair talking quietly to the grandfather while she\r\nsettled herself on the floor beside the east side of the bed. She could\r\nnot understand the words, but she heard acceptance in the old man's\r\nsigh.\r\n\r\nGrief and fear that White Bear would die trembled inside her. Breathing\r\ndeeply, she let the strength of those feelings enter into her spirit,\r\nurging her on to begin the journey she must make.\r\n\r\nShe must go into the other world and find her guide. She began the\r\nmedicine woman's chant Sun Woman had taught her:\r\n\r\n    \"Let me walk through the dark place\r\n    To the light of the other world.\r\n    Oh my red spirit Bird, fly to me,\r\n    Sing to me from the other world.\r\n\r\n    \"Let me walk the sunwise circle\r\n    Into the night that hides this man.\r\n    Oh my red spirit Bird, sing to me\r\n    And fly with me to the other world.\r\n\r\n    \"Sing and fly,\r\n    Sing and fly,\r\n    In the sunwise circle\r\n    To the other world,\r\n    Into the night.\"\r\n\r\nShe allowed the chant to settle into a simple, repetitious humming that\r\nslowly, with the help of the magic mushroom, drew her soul out of her\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nShe stood up. The three people gathered at the foot of the bed did not\r\nsee her standing. They were looking at her seated body. She looked down\r\nat White Bear. She saw through the leaves she had spread over him and\r\nright through his skin.\r\n\r\nFive glowing streaks ran from his collarbone to his belly. The claw\r\nmarks of his guardian.\r\n\r\nShe saw the hole in his chest, how it ran between his ribs. In the eight\r\ndays he had been lying here, the wound had closed up. If he lived long\r\nenough, it would heal slowly. But there was water pooling in his chest,\r\nand the longer he lay there unconscious, the more the water would fill\r\nup his chest until he drowned.\r\n\r\nHis spirit must be coaxed back from the other world.\r\n\r\nShe began to walk the sunwise circle around White Bear's bed, from the\r\neast to the south, White Bear on her right. She passed Yellow Hair,\r\nWhite Bear's grandfather and the old servant. They stood like carved\r\nstatues, unseeing. She walked around the west side of the bed. The head\r\nof the bed was against the north wall of the room, but she simply walked\r\nthrough the wall on one side of the bed, took a few steps along the\r\nnorth side of the cottage, then entered the wall again and continued her\r\ncircle.\r\n\r\nWhen she had completed her ninth circuit of the bed, she saw a cave\r\nmouth in the eastern wall of the bedroom. Unhesitatingly she walked into\r\nthe black, circular opening.\r\n\r\nShe could not see where the light in the cave was coming from, but its\r\ncurving walls were clearly visible to her. Here and there she passed\r\npaintings. She had seen them when she made her first journey to the\r\nother world, after she buried Floating Lily. She saw the Wolf, the\r\nCoyote, the Elk and the Buffalo. Near the floor of the cave she passed\r\npaintings of the Trout, the Pike, the Salmon and other fish. She looked\r\nup and saw the Owl, her father's guardian spirit.\r\n\r\nThe passage slanted downward and grew narrower until her head brushed\r\nthe cave roof and her shoulders touched the walls. Then she rounded a\r\nbend and bright blue light greeted her.\r\n\r\nThe cave opened out high on a hillside. She was looking down at tall\r\nyellow grass rolling in waves to distant hills.\r\n\r\nA black cloud of crows flapped up out of the grass and flew over her\r\nhead, laughing raucously.\r\n\r\nThen she heard a marvelous singing.\r\n\r\nShe recognized it at once, the song of her guardian spirit, the Redbird.\r\nShe saw a blood-colored flash, and then the Bird perched on a branch of\r\nblue spruce on the hillside. He had one bright eye cocked at her, ringed\r\nin black. His red crest stood up on his head as Wolf Paw's had in better\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n\"White Bear is out there on the prairie,\" the Redbird spirit sang. \"He\r\nis hunting his uncle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can I heal him?\" Redbird asked.\r\n\r\nThe dazzling Bird chirped a yes. \"He is lost. He is wandering with his\r\nother self, the Bear spirit. He will not leave the spirit world until\r\nthe Bear finds his uncle.\"\r\n\r\nRedbird shivered. \"What will White Bear's guardian do to his uncle?\" She\r\nremembered both Owl Carver and Sun Woman saying that a shaman's power\r\nmust never be used to harm any person.\r\n\r\n\"What must happen, must happen,\" the Bird sang. \"If White Bear is to be\r\nfree to go back to his body.\"\r\n\r\nRedbird still felt uneasy. A shadow, like a sudden prairie storm, seemed\r\nto fall upon the landscape.\r\n\r\nThe streak of scarlet sailed out over the endless grass, and Redbird ran\r\ndown the hill until the tassels were waving high over her head. She\r\ncould see nothing on all sides of her but yellow spears of straw.\r\nOverhead was a patch of bright blue framed by tassels. In the center of\r\nthe blue the Bird spirit hovered, wings a blur of red. She pushed her\r\nway through the stalks as the Bird led her.\r\n\r\nOn and on flew her spirit guide. Redbird did not tire either, as she\r\nwould have in the ordinary world, trudging through the grass. She could\r\nnot see the sun, but the light seemed never to change. And no matter how\r\nlong she walked, the same bit of cloudless sky remained overhead.\r\n\r\nThen White Bear stood before her.\r\n\r\nHe was wearing only a deerskin loincloth and moccasins. His long hair\r\nwas bound with a beaded band. The scar on his cheek stood out white\r\nagainst his tan skin. She looked at his naked chest and saw the five\r\nshining claw marks, and the small navel-like opening of the bullet\r\nwound.\r\n\r\nShe looked deep into his dark eyes. His love flowed out to her, and she\r\nbathed in it, as in a warm river. She knew his thoughts, how happy and\r\nsurprised he was to see her.\r\n\r\n_I was lost out here. You have come for me._\r\n\r\nHe held out his arms, and she rushed into them. She felt his arms around\r\nher even though he was a spirit and she was a spirit. She laid her head\r\nagainst his scarred chest and listened to his beating heart. Would she\r\never again, back in the world of flesh, hold him like this?\r\n\r\nA huge white-furred head crashed through the wall of grass around them,\r\nand enormous golden eyes looked at her. White Bear had described his\r\nguardian spirit to her, but she had never realized the Bear was so big.\r\nShe looked at black lips that bared yellow teeth longer than her\r\nfingers, she stared down at claws that crushed the grass and sank into\r\nthe prairie sod. She shivered at the thought of what might happen to\r\nWhite Bear's uncle if this spirit found him.\r\n\r\nPerched on the head of the Bear was the tiny red spirit Bird.\r\n\r\n_We are looking for my father's brother_, came White Bear's thought. _He\r\nkilled my mother and many brothers and sisters of yours and mine. He\r\nshot me._\r\n\r\nThe Bird sang to Redbird, \"I know where the uncle is, but I can only\r\nlead the Bear to him if you say I must do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I say you must, then,\" she said, just above a whisper. Whatever was\r\nneeded to save White Bear's life, she had to do it. Whatever she must\r\ngive up in return.\r\n\r\nThe Bird leaped into the air, his crest a bloody spearpoint. The Bear\r\nlifted a black nose the size of Redbird's fist, and the white body\r\nturned to follow, passing before her like a mountain of snow.\r\n\r\nHand in hand White Bear and Redbird followed. The Bird flew far ahead,\r\nand they could not see him, but the Bear trampled down the grass and\r\nleft a path that was easy to follow.\r\n\r\nLoving thoughts passed between White Bear and Redbird. If they always\r\nmet like this, Redbird thought, they could know what was in each other's\r\nheart and their love would be deeper.\r\n\r\nThen she remembered Wolf Paw and the new life that she alone knew was\r\ngrowing in her belly. The life that fulfilled Wolf Paw's wish to have a\r\nchild with her.\r\n\r\nShe felt like a statue carved in ice. And at that very moment White\r\nBear let go of her hand. Somehow she knew that he was withdrawing from\r\nher, not because he had sensed her thought about Wolf Paw, but because\r\nhe was troubled by some thought of his own. But instantly there was a\r\nspace between them, and she no longer knew his mind.\r\n\r\nHe was still walking beside her. He walked straight ahead, not looking\r\nat her. She turned her head to the front and did the same.\r\n\r\nShe felt as if she had been pushed away, hard, and it hurt.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to her that they walked for days through the unchanging grass,\r\nbut the sun remained fixed somewhere beyond the tasseled curtain.\r\n\r\nYellow and blue, yellow and blue, the whole world had been reduced to\r\nthose colors. And to one sound, whispering grass.\r\n\r\nThe Bear stopped walking. Redbird and White Bear went around the huge\r\nanimal, Redbird to the right and White Bear to the left.\r\n\r\nShe found herself on the edge of a great crack in the ground, so deep\r\nthat its bottom lay in shadow. It zigzagged from somewhere, appearing\r\nout of grass, and continued toward somewhere, vanishing back into the\r\nprairie. A stream of bright blue water wound through the dark bottom of\r\nthe ravine; water had cut this wound in the prairie. The Bird spirit\r\nswooped and darted in the crack like a living fire arrow.\r\n\r\n\"White Bear's uncle hides there,\" the Bird trilled.\r\n\r\nShe heard a growl beside her deep as distant thunder, and the ground\r\nseemed to tremble.\r\n\r\nThe Bird flew up, swooped to hover over the Bear's head, then dove down\r\ninto the canyon. Down to an entrance into the earth framed by two\r\nupright wooden posts and a beam laid across them.\r\n\r\nBeside the square of darkness were abandoned wooden carts and a hill of\r\ngray gravel that partly blocked the stream. This was a mine, Redbird\r\nunderstood, where the pale eyes dug metal out of the ground.\r\n\r\nThe Bear spirit put one paw in front of the other and, with grace and\r\nbalance astonishing in a creature so huge, walked down a narrow path\r\nRedbird had not noticed before to the shadowy bottom of the ravine. Then\r\nit lumbered up to the mine mouth.\r\n\r\nShe opened her mouth to cry out in fear, but the Bear was gone.\r\n\r\n_There is a man in there._\r\n\r\nAnd her spirit helper, the Redbird, had led that giant Bear to him. She\r\nhad commanded it. She had not wanted to use her shaman's powers to hurt\r\nanyone, not even one she hated as much as this uncle of White Bear's.\r\nWhite Bear had saved many lives and never killed anyone.\r\n\r\nEven though she was a spirit and this great grassland was sunny, she\r\nfelt cold, and her stomach knotted.\r\n\r\n_I will lose something because I did this. I only did it to bring White\r\nBear back to his body. But I will suffer for it, even so._\r\n\r\n_And so will White Bear._\r\n\r\n_Only let White Bear live_, she prayed to the powers that brought life\r\ninto the world.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear turned to her. _It is done_, said his spirit voice. _My other\r\nself has found Raoul de Marion._\r\n\r\n_Now you can come with me_, she answered him. _Back to your body._\r\n\r\n_Back to my home_, came his whisper, and she shuddered even as she\r\nturned, following the Bird spirit as he fluttered over her head. When he\r\nthought of his home, he meant the great lodge the pale eyes called\r\nVictoire.\r\n\r\nRedbird opened her eyes in the room where White Bear lay, to find\r\nherself once again sitting on the floor beside the bed. The three people\r\nwere looking at her, Yellow Hair with tears running down her cheeks, the\r\ngrandfather's withered face paler than the fur of White Bear's guardian\r\nspirit, the old servant's bloodshot eyes wide.\r\n\r\nShe remembered that the sun had been low in the west when she came to\r\nthis house. Sunlight still slanted through the paper-covered west window\r\nand fell on the layer of leaves that covered White Bear's bed.\r\n\r\nBut when she tried to move, pain struck her like knives driven into her\r\nknees and elbows, as if she had been sitting in the same position for\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n\"His eyes!\" Yellow Hair cried, pointing at White Bear. From the floor\r\nRedbird could not see what Yellow Hair was seeing. She forced her aching\r\nlegs to lift her.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear looked at Redbird, then at Yellow Hair. He smiled faintly.\r\n\r\nShe had done it. He was back in his body.\r\n\r\nA spring of pure, sweet joy burst up inside her. A sob welled from her\r\nlips. She stumbled toward Yellow Hair and felt that she was going to\r\nfall. Yellow Hair's arms held her up.\r\n\r\nShe saw his mouth open, heard him whisper to her, \"You brought me back.\r\nI will always love you.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I will always love you,\" Redbird said. Her voice was a croak, as if\r\nshe had not spoken in days.\r\n\r\nShe turned to Yellow Hair. \"Now he will live.\"\r\n\r\nLaughing and crying at once, Yellow Hair thanked Redbird again and again\r\nin their common language, calling on her God to bless Redbird.\r\n\r\n_Bless me? But what of that man in the mine?_\r\n\r\n\"Give White Bear the tea of elm bark now. Later, little food, only\r\nlittle,\" Redbird said. \"Easy-eat food. Hominy good. Later, soup with\r\nmeat.\"\r\n\r\nYellow Hair eagerly agreed.\r\n\r\n\"Must sleep,\" said Redbird. She slurred her words, too worn out to speak\r\nclearly.\r\n\r\nShe could lie down in another room, Yellow Hair said, leading her away\r\nfrom the canopied bed where the weeping grandfather bent over White\r\nBear, holding him by his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"I gone many days?\" Redbird asked.\r\n\r\nYellow Hair's deep blue eyes widened. She shook her head at the word\r\n\"days.\" She assured Redbird that she had been silent only for an\r\ninstant. She had been singing, then she closed her eyes, and a moment\r\nlater when she opened them again, White Bear had opened his. Yellow Hair\r\nhugged her so hard it hurt her.\r\n\r\n_Just an instant?_ Every time Redbird went on a shaman's journey she\r\nlearned something new.\r\n\r\nYellow Hair, her arm around Redbird's shoulders, led her to a bed in\r\nanother room. Redbird had never lain on a pale eyes' bed, but she sat\r\ndown on the edge and fell back. If she was not so tired she would not\r\nhave been able to sleep in this bed. It was too soft. Yellow Hair lifted\r\nher legs onto the bed for her.\r\n\r\nThat was the last thing Redbird remembered.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter a day and a night of sleep, Redbird woke refreshed. And hungry. A\r\ncure for that was quickly produced for her; and now she was sitting on a\r\npale eyes' chair at a pale eyes' table, devouring slices of fried pig\r\nmeat and fluffy cakes brought to her by the old servant.\r\n\r\nSeated across from her was a fat, smiling woman she had met once\r\nbefore. This woman had tried to comfort her the day Floating Lily was\r\nkilled. This, she knew, was White Bear's aunt.\r\n\r\nYellow Hair, tears streaming from her turquoise eyes, appeared in the\r\ndoorway of the room where White Bear lay.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear, she said, wanted Redbird to come to him.\r\n\r\nRedbird's hunger vanished. She went rigid.\r\n\r\n_Yellow Hair weeps now, but I will weep forever after._\r\n\r\nShe heard the suffering in Yellow Hair's voice and knew that her heart\r\nwas hurting because she believed Redbird was going to take White Bear\r\naway from her.\r\n\r\nRedbird knew better. She had defiled her powers by using them to destroy\r\nWhite Bear's uncle, and now she must pay for it.\r\n\r\nThe lance twisted in her heart as she stood up at the table.\r\n\r\nThe fat woman stood up when Redbird did, came around the table and\r\nhugged her. She smelled of fresh-baked bread.\r\n\r\nRedbird walked past Yellow Hair to enter the bedroom. White Bear was\r\nreclining with pillows behind his head in the bed where he had lain for\r\nso many days. His chest was bare except for the white bindings that\r\nprotected his wound. The wrappings made his olive skin look darker, and\r\nabove the cloth Redbird could see the start of the five shining scars\r\nthat ran down his chest.\r\n\r\nThe leaves had been cleared away from the quilt that covered him. His\r\nbundle of talking papers telling the story of the first man and woman\r\nand how they lost their land of happiness was on the table beside his\r\nbed. Next to it lay the knife Star Arrow had given him when he was a\r\nsmall boy.\r\n\r\nWhen he saw her his face glowed and he held out his arms to her. She\r\nrushed to him, and heard a cry of pain behind her. The door of the\r\nbedroom shut softly.\r\n\r\nShe threw herself across the bed, longing to hold White Bear. His arms\r\naround her were not as strong as she remembered them, but his embrace\r\nwas firm.\r\n\r\n\"You came to me while my spirit wandered on the prairie,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"The Redbird guided me to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Before you came I saw many things.\"\r\n\r\n\"What things?\"\r\n\r\nHe said, \"The pale eyes will spread across the Great River and even\r\ninto the Great Desert. There will be no place left for our people.\"\r\n\r\n\"If we go far enough west--\" she began.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he said. \"They will go as far as the western ocean. The Turtle\r\nwarned me about this.\" He stroked her hair lightly, and she rested her\r\nhead on his shoulder.\r\n\r\nShe had a heart-crushing feeling that she would never lie like this with\r\nhim again.\r\n\r\n\"You are so much better today,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"You, too, know the way of the shaman now. You healed me.\"\r\n\r\nShe lifted her head and looked into his eyes. This was the moment when\r\nthey must decide.\r\n\r\n\"I am the only shaman our people have now,\" she forced herself to say.\r\n\"The few who are left need me. I must go back to them.\"\r\n\r\nHis eyes shut tight suddenly, as if his wound was paining him.\r\n\r\n\"Stay here with me,\" he said.\r\n\r\nHis words struck her and tore through her, as his uncle's bullet had\r\ntorn through him.\r\n\r\n\"I could never stay here. When you are well enough, will you not come\r\nback to your people?\"\r\n\r\nHe shook his head. \"We cannot fight the pale eyes and we cannot run from\r\nthem. They will destroy us. Unless we learn to live as the pale eyes\r\ndo.\"\r\n\r\n\"That destroys us too.\"\r\n\r\n\"That saves us!\" His nostrils flared and his dark eyes glowed. \"I can\r\nuse the power this wealth and this land gives me to fight for our\r\npeople. And you can do it with me. And Eagle Feather. I will show the\r\npeople how to make use of pale eyes' ways. I will share my land with\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nHer heart felt as if it were being ground between stones. This, she\r\nunderstood, was what she must suffer because she had used her shaman's\r\npowers to hurt another. She was going to lose White Bear. She had saved\r\nhim from death. He was going to live, but not with her.\r\n\r\nThe claws of that giant Bear that was his other self seemed to stab into\r\nher chest and tear her in two. She could not live with this pain. She\r\nmust surrender to White Bear.\r\n\r\n_Yes, I must stay with him. I cannot leave him. Eagle Feather needs him.\r\nWe will be safe here, and comfortable, and at peace._\r\n\r\nShe would send for Eagle Feather. The fat aunt and the grandfather would\r\nlove them and care for them.\r\n\r\nShe tried to see herself living here with White Bear. For a moment the\r\npicture was clear in her mind. Then it dissolved in blackness as she\r\nrealized that taking herself out of the Sauk tribe would be like pulling\r\na medicine plant up by its roots without its consent.\r\n\r\nShe would die. It would be a slow death that would be worse than the\r\npain she was suffering now.\r\n\r\nAnd then another thought struck her.\r\n\r\n_Children!_\r\n\r\nHer heart felt heavy as a mountain.\r\n\r\nShe remembered how Owl Carver had said, after Eagle Feather smoked the\r\npeace pipe with the Winnebago, that he could be a greater shaman than\r\nany of them. But that would happen only if he was raised as a Sauk.\r\n\r\nFloating Lily was dead. Redbird could not live with the people who had\r\nmurdered her.\r\n\r\nAnd--she touched her belly--this was not White Bear's child.\r\n\r\nShe began to cry aloud.\r\n\r\nShe sobbed till she thought her ribs would crack. Her throat burned; her\r\nvoice rasped. She pressed her forehead against his chest. She heard him\r\ngroan in pain, but he was hurting her more than she could ever hurt him.\r\n\r\n\"How can you ask me to stay where they killed Floating Lily? How can\r\n_you_ stay here?\"\r\n\r\n\"What would you have me do?\"\r\n\r\nA sudden thought occurred to her. \"The pale eyes give gold for land.\r\nTake pale eyes gold for this land, and you can take the gold with you to\r\nthe Ioway country and share it with our people.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Redbird,\" he said sadly. \"What could we do with gold, out there in\r\nIoway? Sometimes the long knives have given our chiefs gold in return\r\nfor land, yes. In no time the gold melted away. Gold by itself is like\r\nseed corn. Without the right ground to plant it in, it is soon used up\r\nand gone. The only way I can use the wealth my father Star Arrow left to\r\nme is to stay here and work with it.\"\r\n\r\nShe had stopped crying. This hurt too much for tears. Only when Floating\r\nLily was killed had she felt more pain than this.\r\n\r\nFor a moment she could not bring herself to say the words she had to\r\nsay.\r\n\r\nFrom somewhere she summoned the strength to speak.\r\n\r\n\"Then I must leave you.\"\r\n\r\nEach word, she felt, was an arrow fired into him.\r\n\r\nHis arms tightened around her. \"I beg you to stay.\"\r\n\r\n_Spirit of the Redbird, help me to do what I must._\r\n\r\nIt would hurt less if she acted at once. She pushed herself away from\r\nhim. She stood up and crossed the room to the closed door.\r\n\r\n\"May you walk always in honor, White Bear.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Redbird, no!\" _He_ was crying bitterly now, and he rolled over and\r\nburied his head in his pillows, beating the bed with his clenched fists.\r\n\r\nShe could not bear to leave him weeping like this, like a child she was\r\nabandoning. She would rather see him angry.\r\n\r\nThen the spirit Bird, whom she had called on for help, sent her a\r\nmessage. She saw Wolf Paw, as he had looked when he was proud and\r\nundefeated, with the red crest on his head, a red blanket wrapped around\r\nhim and black paint around his eyes.\r\n\r\n_Why did I never see it before?_\r\n\r\nWolf Paw wore the markings of the Bird she was named after, the Bird\r\nthat was her spirit guide. Neither she nor he had been aware of it. But\r\nit must mean that they were destined for each other, and that what had\r\nalready happened between herself and Wolf Paw _had_ to happen.\r\n\r\nTo live out her life with Wolf Paw and never to see White Bear again was\r\nlike being told she would never again see a day with sunlight.\r\n\r\nBut it was as the spirit Bird had sung to her-- _What must happen, must\r\nhappen_.\r\n\r\nShe breathed deeply. She hated having to tell White Bear about Wolf Paw.\r\nIf he had been willing to come with her, she would not have had to say\r\nanything. Wolf Paw would not have tried to hold her. And if she gave\r\nbirth a moon or two too soon, White Bear would have forgiven her. But\r\nnow she had to use Wolf Paw to hurt White Bear.\r\n\r\nTo hurt him so as to heal him.\r\n\r\n_But when I am gone from here, who will heal me? Must the shaman suffer\r\nwounds that can never be healed?_\r\n\r\n_Yes, if she has dealt such wounds._\r\n\r\n\"You would not want me anymore, White Bear,\" she said. \"These past moons\r\nsince you left us I have been Wolf Paw's woman.\"\r\n\r\nHe raised his tear-streaked face from the pillow and stared at her.\r\n\"What are you saying?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wolf Paw lost his wives and his children at the Bad Axe. He was like a\r\ndead man. I wanted to heal him, and I will heal him, by living with\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\nHis eyes widened. She could see anger darkening his cheeks.\r\n\r\nHe said, \"After my father took me to live here, you waited six summers\r\nfor me while Wolf Paw courted you. Could you not keep him off for a few\r\nmoons?\"\r\n\r\nShe held out her hands imploringly. \"Before, when he was an honored\r\nwarrior and had his family, he had no need of me. He wanted me as he\r\nwanted another feather to hang in his hair. But now he needs me. Without\r\nme he would be as good as dead. And he is the last brave in our band.\"\r\n\r\n\"I need you.\"\r\n\r\nShe put her hands over her belly. It was still flat, but she knew what\r\nwas there.\r\n\r\n\"I am carrying Wolf Paw's child.\"\r\n\r\nHe pushed against the bed till he was sitting bolt upright, and he\r\npounded his fist on his knee. He was still badly wounded. He could hurt\r\nhimself. What if he tried to get out of bed, and tore the wound open?\r\n\r\nBut when he looked up at her his eyes were large and dark with sadness.\r\n\r\n\"I still love you, whatever you did with Wolf Paw. And I will love _any_\r\nbaby you bear.\"\r\n\r\nShe felt his hands seize her heart, tearing it out of her chest,\r\ncrushing it. She cried out with the pain and staggered backward.\r\n\r\nShe cried, \"You offer me everything but the one thing I want--for you to\r\ncome back to our people.\"\r\n\r\n\"What I do, I do for our people.\" His voice was so low that she could\r\nbarely hear him. \"One Sauk, at least, will take back land the pale eyes\r\nstole from us.\"\r\n\r\nThe world grew darker and darker for her. With every word he spoke she\r\nwas losing him a little more.\r\n\r\nShe made the flat-handed \"no\" gesture. \"The pale eyes here in this land\r\nare too strong for the red people. And in you there is both pale eyes\r\nand red man, and the pale eyes is stronger than the red.\"\r\n\r\nHis shoulders slumped. She saw a dullness in his eyes that made her\r\nthink of Wolf Paw as he had looked after the people of Victor had killed\r\nFloating Lily.\r\n\r\n_Have I hurt White Bear so badly that he will get sick again?_ Sudden\r\nfear rippled through her.\r\n\r\nBut then he lifted his head and looked at her, and there was strength in\r\nhis gaunt face.\r\n\r\n\"I will always love you. And as long as this place is mine, there will\r\nbe a home here for you, for Eagle Feather, for any child of yours. For\r\nany Sauk. When you go back, tell them that.\"\r\n\r\nGrief crushed her as she gazed at the man she loved, knowing that they\r\nwere parting forever.\r\n\r\nHe reached out to her, and she went back to lie beside him on the bed.\r\nIt felt so good to be held by him, and it hurt so much to know that this\r\nwas the last time they would ever lie heart against heart, she thought\r\nshe would scream at the agony of it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Good-bye, Floating Lily, my daughter. I may never be able to come back\r\nhere again. I hope you have begun your journey West. But if your spirit\r\nlingers here, know that your father is close by._\r\n\r\nRedbird stood a moment looking down at the mound of earth, now covered\r\nwith leaves, the strip of red blanket tied to the willow wand now faded.\r\nShe rocked back and forth in the pale eyes shoes made of heavy leather\r\nthat Yellow Hair had given her. She wailed softly in her sorrow for\r\nFloating Lily.\r\n\r\nThen she turned to Yellow Hair, who stood under a nearby maple.\r\n\r\n\"You take White Bear here and show him.\"\r\n\r\nYellow Hair nodded.\r\n\r\nThey went back to Yellow Hair's carriage. The buggy was laden with food\r\nand blankets, and Redbird carried with her a heavy bag of gold coins\r\ngiven her by White Bear's grandfather. Used wisely, the gold would buy\r\nblankets and food, rifles and ammunition from the traders to help the\r\nSauk get through the winter. Now they would not have to winter over at\r\nFort Armstrong, but could cross over at once to join the rest of the\r\ntribe in Ioway.\r\n\r\nThe wound in Redbird's heart ached constantly, and she sat bent forward\r\non the buggy seat, her hands gripping her knees. As they rattled down\r\nthe road to Fort Armstrong she felt some small relief at leaving the\r\nplace where she had lost so much. She tried to tell herself that she was\r\non the way to a new life.\r\n\r\nYellow Hair said she didn't understand why White Bear was not with them.\r\nShe wanted to know if he would follow Redbird when he got better.\r\n\r\n_She understands, but she does not dare believe he is going to stay with\r\nher. She thinks it is too much to hope for._\r\n\r\nRedbird said, \"He still your husband, Yellow Hair. You want him?\"\r\n\r\nYellow Hair's lips quivered as she asked, would Redbird not come back to\r\nbe with White Bear?\r\n\r\nRedbird gritted her teeth. It hurt to have to explain to Yellow Hair.\r\n\r\nRedbird made the flat-hand motion. \"He not follow me. I never come back\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\nNow Yellow Hair's eyes were glowing like turquoise set in silver. But\r\nshe put a comforting hand on Redbird's arm.\r\n\r\nShe wanted to know why. How could Redbird part from White Bear and he\r\nfrom her? Did it not hurt too much?\r\n\r\n\"Yes, hurt much,\" said Redbird softly, watching the rutted dirt road\r\npass under the wheels of the buggy.\r\n\r\nBut Yellow Hair pressed her. How could White Bear tear himself away from\r\nthe Sauk?\r\n\r\n\"Pale eyes family now his people.\"\r\n\r\nBut his son--how could he give up his son?\r\n\r\nRedbird struggled to find words and gestures to explain this. \"Maybe\r\nsome day White Bear come for Eagle Feather, like Star Arrow once come\r\nfor White Bear.\" She remembered how White Bear had wept when Sun Woman\r\ntold him he must go to live with the pale eyes. \"That day, I not say\r\nEagle Feather must go or must not go. Eagle Feather do what he want.\"\r\n\r\nYellow Hair shook her head, her braids lashing. She repeated over and\r\nover again an English word Redbird understood, but it asked a question\r\nshe could never answer.\r\n\r\n\"_Why?_\"\r\n\r\nAgain Redbird wrestled with the English words. \"Land of his father and\r\ngrandfather holds him. He not want to leave.\"\r\n\r\nBut what about the uncle who nearly killed him?\r\n\r\n\"That uncle no more trouble,\" said Redbird.\r\n\r\n_And because of that, I must lose him._\r\n\r\nThen when would Redbird see White Bear again? Yellow Hair's question\r\nburied itself in Redbird's heart like a steel arrowhead.\r\n\r\n\"Never!\" she screamed.\r\n\r\nYellow Hair shrank back, her eyes wide with shock. Redbird sighed and\r\nlet her body droop.\r\n\r\nThey drove on in silence. Redbird heard small sounds beside her that\r\ntold her Yellow Hair was weeping.\r\n\r\nRedbird reached over and took Yellow Hair's hand.\r\n\r\n\"Make him happy.\"\r\n\r\nYellow Hair uttered a sob and turned her head away.\r\n\r\nBut Redbird was no longer crying. Dry-eyed, she stared ahead at the road\r\nsouth. Her sorrow was too deep for tears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n26\r\n\r\nBlood on the Land\r\n\r\n\r\nRaoul François Philippe Charles de Marion woke trembling in damp\r\nblackness, wondering whether it was day or night outside. His heart was\r\nbeating so hard that it ached. For a moment he couldn't think what had\r\nscared him so badly. Then he remembered the dream.\r\n\r\nHe struggled out of the old blanket he'd wrapped around himself and sat\r\nup, panting.\r\n\r\nA white bear coming at him down here in the mine. Why in hell would he\r\ndream about a creature like that? There were white bears up in Canada,\r\nhe'd heard, but he'd never even seen one.\r\n\r\nWhite Bear--that was Auguste's Indian name. Was he dreaming about\r\nAuguste coming after him?\r\n\r\n_Well, Auguste is rotting in the ground now. I killed him._\r\n\r\nHe still hated Auguste even after his death. Because of Auguste he had\r\nto stay holed up here, blackness pressing on his eyeballs. His eyes were\r\nwide open and he stared till they hurt, but he could see nothing,\r\nnothing at all. It was like being blind.\r\n\r\nHe wished he had told just one of his men where to find him. He badly\r\nwanted news of what was going on back at Victor. But if he'd told anyone\r\nit would have been Armand, and he couldn't trust the bastard. Armand\r\nmight stupidly let himself be followed here. Or give way to threats, or\r\neven sell him out, if Papa offered a big enough reward.\r\n\r\n_Armand would. Sure he would. I could see in his eyes how he resented\r\nme. He hated Pierre and he hated me too._\r\n\r\nRaoul only had two candles left. Should he light one now? He could spare\r\nit, because he was going to get out of this mine today--or tonight. He'd\r\nwaited long enough.\r\n\r\nHe wasn't sure anymore how long he'd been hiding down here in the dark.\r\nWhen he slept, he had no idea how long he slept. A watch was one of the\r\nmany things he had forgotten to bring with him, leaving in such a hurry.\r\nAnd yet he'd stupidly brought the silver case with Pierre's spectacles\r\nin it. Stuck it in his pocket when he left the trading post to get the\r\nmongrel. He felt it now, a hard oval in his coat pocket.\r\n\r\nHow long?\r\n\r\nThe men pursuing him had searched the mine, as he figured they would.\r\nDays had passed, he was sure, since he'd heard their voices in the mine,\r\nfootsteps echoing. He was certain he was the only man in Victor who knew\r\nabout the tunnel he was hiding in, its entrance, just big enough to\r\ncrawl through, covered by a pile of gravel that appeared to have nothing\r\nbut wall behind it. He'd tried to disturb the gravel as little as\r\npossible while crawling in, and had carefully replaced what he'd pushed\r\naside.\r\n\r\nBut he might have left some trace on the other side. He'd sat in the\r\nblackness, waiting to hear the sounds of digging, his back pressed\r\nagainst the damp rock wall, knees drawn up to his chin. His hands, cold\r\nas if they'd been plunged into a snowdrift, had rested on his loaded\r\nrifle and his pistol. And he'd drawn his Bowie knife and laid it beside\r\nhim. They'd pay dearly to take him. If there were no more than four or\r\nfive of them, he might manage to kill them all and get away.\r\n\r\nBut the sounds of the search party had faded away. He'd welcomed the\r\nblack cotton silence that had followed. He would stay down here as long\r\nas he could. He'd found a place in his tunnel where underground water\r\nhad seeped in, and was able to keep refilling his canteen from that. He\r\nfound another small branch tunnel some distance from where he slept,\r\nwhere he could piss and shit. But he'd come into the mine with only six\r\ncandles, and he was afraid to use them up, so he spent most of the time\r\nsitting in the dark feeling as if he was going mad with alternating\r\nworry and boredom.\r\n\r\nHe had brought his canteen of whiskey down here with him, and it had\r\nmade time pass easier for a while. But now it was all gone. Seemed like\r\na hell of a long time since he'd had a drink.\r\n\r\nHe made a flame with flint, steel and cotton wool, lit his next to last\r\ncandle and set it in a pool of its own wax. The light hurt his eyes for\r\na moment, and the sight of his own shadow moving on the dark gray rock\r\nwalls frightened him.\r\n\r\nHis hollow belly kept squealing and grumbling, and visions of beef and\r\nturkey and duck and pork tormented him. Out of one of his saddlebags he\r\ntook the bundle of corn biscuits and dried beef he'd thrown together at\r\nthe trading post in his flight. He bit into a biscuit as hard and dry as\r\na lump of wood and rolled it around in his mouth until his saliva\r\nsoftened it enough to chew and swallow.\r\n\r\nNow he'd go up to the mine entrance, and if it was nighttime he'd leave.\r\nThe Flemings had their cabin about a mile from here. Their men had\r\njoined the Regulators, so they deserved to have him take a horse from\r\nthem. Then he'd ride north to Galena.\r\n\r\nHe hefted the other saddlebag, loaded with gold and silver coins and\r\nBank of Illinois paper. He'd had to leave a lot behind in his office\r\nsafe, and they'd probably steal it from him. But he'd get it all back.\r\n\r\nBecause this was enough to buy him an army.\r\n\r\nGalena would be crowded with the roughest men in the Northwest Territory\r\nright now. Surely more men than could make a living in the mines around\r\nthere, boom or no boom. Rough and hungry, just what he needed.\r\n\r\n_I'll yet see that high-and-mighty Cooper swinging from a tree. And I'll\r\npiss on Auguste's grave._\r\n\r\nHe bit into a slice of dried beef. It was tough as rawhide, but he\r\nforced it down.\r\n\r\n_When I'm running things in Smith County again, Nicole and Frank and\r\nthat pack of squalling brats are leaving. I've put up with Frank and his\r\ndamned newspaper long enough, just because he's married to my sister._\r\n\r\nIf Frank gave any trouble, his new press, the one Papa helped him buy,\r\nwould end up at the bottom of the Mississippi. Or maybe he'd even be\r\nCooper's dancing partner on that tree.\r\n\r\n_I've knocked my father down. I've killed my brother's squaw and his\r\nmongrel bastard son. Why put up with my sister and her husband? What\r\nhave they ever done, except hate me?_\r\n\r\nAnd the old man would have to go, too, if he was still alive, and that\r\nbrandy-pickled bag of bones, Guichard. Time to be rid of them all. De\r\nMarion would still be the foremost name in Smith County, but it would be\r\na new de Marion family, not this old Injun-loving bunch that understood\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nNancy. What about her?\r\n\r\nThe teacher needed to be taught a lesson or two. If she hadn't let\r\nAuguste service her when she was captured by the Injuns, then she'd\r\nprobably never had a man's cock up inside her. Once she found out what\r\npleasure he could give her, she'd forget about Auguste. She was still\r\nyoung enough for children, good-looking children, and smart.\r\n\r\nThat brat Woodrow that she had living with her. Imagine him saying in\r\ncourt that the redskins treated him better than his parents did. Send\r\nhim packing, just like the Hopkinses.\r\n\r\nWith Smith County and with Nancy all his, it would be time to rebuild\r\nVictoire.\r\n\r\nHe'd put that off because he wanted to do it right. And he'd left the\r\nruin till now to remind himself and everyone in Victor why the Sauk had\r\nto be driven out of Illinois.\r\n\r\nNo, that was a damned lie.\r\n\r\nAlone here in the dark he could not keep the truth from pecking at his\r\nbrain like a buzzard's beak: Every time he went near the ruin of the\r\nchâteau, he thought of Clarissa and the boys, and guilt stabbed him\r\nwithout mercy. He'd looked down on Clarissa, and he had not felt for the\r\nboys as a father should.\r\n\r\nHe'd left them unprotected, let them die horribly, just as Helene had\r\ndied.\r\n\r\n_I did to Andy and Phil just what Papa and Pierre did to me. When my\r\nboys needed me most, I wasn't there._\r\n\r\n_And the Sauk never would have attacked Victor if I hadn't shot Auguste\r\nand the other two redskins at Old Man's Creek._\r\n\r\nHe forced himself to stop thinking about the family he'd made without\r\nwanting to and then had lost. Their blood was spilled, and nothing would\r\nbring them back. He'd shed plenty of Indian blood to avenge them.\r\n\r\nHe remembered the Indian witch woman, Auguste's mother, the Bowie knife\r\nslicing open her throat, her blood warm on his hand. What curse had she\r\nlaid on him before he killed her?\r\n\r\nHe put her out of his mind and thought of Victoire. When he rebuilt\r\nVictoire it would not be just another blockhouse, but a stone mansion\r\nthat could be seen from the river. It would be the center of Raoul de\r\nMarion's new empire--steamships, railroads, cattle, farmlands, mines.\r\nNow that the Indians were gone for good, now that Pierre's bastard was\r\ndead, there was no limit to what Raoul could make of the family's\r\nwealth.\r\n\r\nThe dreams heartened him. Time to move. He stuffed the little bundle of\r\nbeef and biscuit into one saddlebag. He slung the saddlebags over his\r\nshoulder, the light one with food hanging down his front, the heavy one\r\nwith the money in it on his back. He loosened the Bowie knife in its\r\nsheath on his left hip. He checked the loads in his pistol and his rifle\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nAs he pushed back his coat to holster his pistol, he felt Pierre's\r\nspectacle case in his pocket.\r\n\r\n_What the hell am I carrying that around for?_\r\n\r\nAt times he'd suspected that he kept Pierre's spectacles because he\r\nreally did love his older brother, in spite of everything Pierre had\r\ndone to him.\r\n\r\nThe silver case, he told himself, was valuable. But the spectacles were\r\nworthless. The eyes that had needed them had stopped seeing a year ago.\r\n\r\n_Had they?_\r\n\r\nHe opened the case. The lenses glinted in the candlelight as if there\r\nwere eyes behind them.\r\n\r\n\"Goddamn it!\" he shouted, and turned the case over, dropping the\r\nspectacles to the stone floor. They shattered with a crack that sounded\r\nloud as a pistol shot. He stamped on them for good measure, crushing the\r\nglass to glittering splinters and twisting the frames out of shape under\r\nthe sole of his boot.\r\n\r\nHe threw the case into a pile of rock shards. Valuable or not, he didn't\r\nwant the damned thing anymore.\r\n\r\n\"I hope you're in Hell, Pierre!\"\r\n\r\nHe didn't love Pierre. He hated him. He'd never loved him. He'd always\r\nhated him, ever since Fort Dearborn.\r\n\r\nHolding the bit of candle high in his left hand, his rifle in his right,\r\nhe started up the sloping tunnel. It was a long climb; the sacks of\r\ncoins in the saddlebag on his back weighed him down.\r\n\r\nHe stopped at the gravel pile that blocked entry to this tunnel. He\r\nlistened, and heard nothing but his blood hissing in his ears. He\r\nscraped chunks of stone away from the pile until he could crawl through.\r\n\r\nAfter more walking and climbing through tunnels and shafts, he no\r\nlonger had any notion how long it had been since he left his hideout. He\r\nsaw ahead a little square of gray, in the center of the black all around\r\nhim. And then he could make out the walls and floor of the tunnel.\r\nMoonlight or starlight must be illuminating the mine entrance. Night,\r\nthen. Good, he could leave at once.\r\n\r\nAbout twenty feet from the entrance he saw up ahead an opening where\r\nanother tunnel branched off from this one. He remembered it. This was\r\nthe side tunnel where the Indian he'd killed seven years ago had hidden.\r\n\r\nAs he came close to that opening he heard a rumbling sound.\r\n\r\nThe growl of an animal.\r\n\r\nHe felt as if he'd been doused with ice-cold water.\r\n\r\nHe took a few steps back from the branch tunnel opening, curled his\r\nfinger around the trigger of his rifle and raised it, one-handed. He\r\ndidn't want to let go of the candle.\r\n\r\nIt hadn't just been a dream. There _was_ something in this mine.\r\n\r\nMaybe a wolf. Or a bear would like a deserted mine like this for a den.\r\n\r\nHe heard snuffling, grunting noises. Then a growl so deep it seemed to\r\nshake the stone under his feet. He felt his stomach clench, and he\r\nnearly lost his grip on his bowels.\r\n\r\nClaws scraped on rock. With trembling fingers he set the candle in one\r\nof the wall niches the miners had carved for their lanterns and raised\r\nhis rifle to his shoulder.\r\n\r\nThe bear came out of the branch tunnel. He saw the huge, pointed white\r\nhead from the side at first, with a golden eye that glared at him. A\r\nperfectly white bear.\r\n\r\nLike his dream.\r\n\r\nThe head swung toward him, a gaping mouth lined with teeth like ivory\r\ndaggers.\r\n\r\nThe whole white body emerged, bigger than a bull bison.\r\n\r\nIt roared, deafening as a cannon blast. It reared up on its hind legs,\r\nfilling the tunnel like a white avalanche. After the roar, it rumbled\r\nsteadily, deep in its chest. Though it was more than ten feet away, he\r\ncould smell its rotten-meat breath.\r\n\r\nHe squeezed the trigger. His rifle thundered, echoes slamming the sides\r\nof his head. Smoke obscured the vast white body. His ears jangled.\r\n\r\nHe felt a sudden terror that the shot might start a cave-in.\r\n\r\nBut it didn't.\r\n\r\nIt didn't stop the bear either. It came on, padded feet scraping on the\r\ntunnel floor, swinging claws like rows of sickles.\r\n\r\n_I couldn't have missed. Oh Jesus, oh God, I couldn't have._\r\n\r\nHe threw the rifle down, snatched his pistol out of his holster and\r\nfired again.\r\n\r\nBlinding flash, deafening blast, stinking smoke.\r\n\r\nAnd the bear kept coming.\r\n\r\nIt was so close, the lead balls _must_ have gone into it. It must be\r\njust so damned big it would take more than two shots to kill it.\r\n\r\nBut there was no time to reload. The bear towered over him, white body\r\nfilling the whole world, eyes, claws, teeth, all shining in the glow of\r\nthat pitiful little candle that somehow had stayed lit.\r\n\r\nHe screamed and sobbed like a little boy in his terror, but he managed\r\nto get his Bowie knife out. He'd killed a big Indian with this knife.\r\n\r\nA paw the size of his head knocked the knife from his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, please don't kill me!\" he wept. \"For the love of Jesus!\"\r\n\r\nThe other paw hit his chest like a sledgehammer. He felt his ribs cave\r\nin. He felt the claws stab into his lungs.\r\n\r\nHis breath flew from his body. His strength drained away. He couldn't\r\nscream anymore. He couldn't beg for his life. His voice was gone. Only\r\nblood came out of his throat. The last thing he saw was an enormous\r\nmouth gaping, full of yellow-white pointed teeth coming at him. He felt\r\nclaws rip again through his chest and belly and knew that he was going.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe pale eyes' smoke boat was a frightening thing, shooting black clouds\r\nand sparks from two black-painted iron tubes that rose up from a big\r\nlodge in its middle. On each side of the boat was a wheel with wooden\r\nboards attached, and the wheels and boards pushed the boat through the\r\nwater. Standing on the floor of wood planks at the front end of the\r\nboat, Redbird tried to understand how fire in the boat's belly could\r\nmake wheels turn. She felt the monstrous thing tremble under her as it\r\nswam across the river.\r\n\r\nAbout a hundred women and children with a few men were crowded at the\r\nfront of the boat, watching the Ioway shore of the Great River come\r\ncloser. By unspoken agreement they kept their backs turned to the land\r\nthat had once been so good to them, the land they had forever lost.\r\n\r\n_The happy land that was lost_, Redbird thought.\r\n\r\nAt the memory of White Bear, grief stabbed her, and she had to rest\r\nagainst the railing of the boat. She felt an aching hollow as if she had\r\nbeen gutted like a butchered deer.\r\n\r\nIn their midst rose a little mountain of boxes, barrels, sacks and\r\nbales, the supplies they had bought with White Bear's grandfather's\r\ngold. But they had no horses, and when they got to the Ioway shore they\r\nwould have to carry these goods on their backs, a journey of probably\r\nfour days across the strip of land by the river that He Who Moves\r\nAlertly had surrendered to the long knives. Somewhere beyond that land\r\nthey would find the Sauk and Fox who had been wise enough not to follow\r\nBlack Hawk. She hoped it would not start to snow before they reached the\r\ncamps of their people.\r\n\r\nWolf Paw said, \"I have heard that this is the very boat that killed so\r\nmany of our people at the Bad Axe.\"\r\n\r\nThis boat had killed his wives and his children, then, thought Redbird.\r\nShe rested her hand on his arm.\r\n\r\n\"See there,\" he said, pointing to holes and black marks on the wood at\r\nthe very front end. \"A thunder gun was set there. It fired at our people\r\nand tore them to pieces. Like the one that killed so many of our\r\nwarriors at the pale eyes town.\" Through his worn buckskin shirt he\r\ntouched the silver coin that still hung around his neck on a leather\r\nthong. Redbird remembered the day White Bear had dug the coin out of\r\nWolf Paw's body, claiming he had changed a lead ball into a coin.\r\n\r\nShe put her hand on her aching heart. Would things ever stop reminding\r\nher of White Bear?\r\n\r\nShe stared down at the gray-green water rushing by the side of the boat,\r\nand it made her dizzy. A canoe could never travel this fast, even a big\r\none paddled by many men. And a canoe could never go straight across the\r\nriver, without being pushed downstream by the current, as this\r\nsmoke-belching boat was doing.\r\n\r\nHad she been wrong not to stay with White Bear, as he had begged her to?\r\nShe missed him so much. Tears came to her eyes. She hoped Wolf Paw and\r\nEagle Feather would not see her crying, and she wiped her eyes quickly.\r\n\r\nShe felt like jumping from this boat and swimming back to shore. If she\r\ndrowned in the Great River, even that would be better than being carried\r\naway from White Bear.\r\n\r\nShe told herself she had made up her mind. She was determined to be a\r\nSauk for the rest of her days. And Eagle Feather would be a Sauk.\r\n\r\n_White Bear is wrong to stay behind, even for all that land._\r\n\r\nEagle Feather gripped her arm. \"Do not be afraid, Mother. The pale eyes\r\nwill not hurt us today.\" His blue eyes were sad. He must have noticed\r\nher misery.\r\n\r\nWolf Paw smiled faintly. \"No, today they only want to be rid of us.\"\r\n\r\nEagle Feather said, \"One day Earthmaker will give us a medicine so\r\nstrong that the long knives' guns will not hurt us.\"\r\n\r\nRedbird smiled at her son. \"May it be you who finds that medicine.\"\r\n\r\n_We can hope for that. Now that we have lost so much, the spirits might\r\ngrant us new powers that will help us to resist the pale eyes._\r\n\r\nOf one thing she was sure, White Bear's way was not a trail that the\r\npeople should travel. For a Sauk to become a pale eyes was a kind of\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n_We are Sauk, or we are nothing. White Bear is no longer a Sauk. My\r\nhusband is dead._\r\n\r\nShe turned back to Wolf Paw and Eagle Feather. She did not like to see\r\nWolf Paw's hair hanging loose around his head, his slumped shoulders. He\r\nhad always stood so straight. Before the people at Victor killed\r\nFloating Lily.\r\n\r\nShe put her hand on his back and stroked it with a circular motion, and\r\nhe straightened his shoulders. As he looked at her a light dawned in his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nShe must get him to shave his head again, to put the red crest back in\r\nplace. The people needed a new leader, a true leader. Black Hawk had\r\nbeen wrong too many times, and He Who Moves Alertly would do whatever\r\nthe pale eyes told him to do. Wolf Paw would help her heal the people.\r\n\r\n_How I hated him the night he mocked White Bear, putting a woman's dress\r\non him. But he has suffered much since then, and he is a wiser man now._\r\n\r\nEagle Feather was standing at the rail looking across the purple river\r\nat the winter-gray hills on the Ioway shore. Redbird moved to stand\r\nbehind him and put her hands on his small, square shoulders. He held\r\nhimself very straight.\r\n\r\nEagle Feather said suddenly, \"I wish I could have seen my father one\r\nlast time.\" She could barely hear him above the noise of the smoke boat\r\nand the rushing water.\r\n\r\nShe closed her eyes against the pain of that and bit her lower lip to\r\nkeep it from trembling.\r\n\r\nWhen she was able to speak she said, \"I think that one day you will see\r\nhim again.\"\r\n\r\nBut for now Eagle Feather and White Bear must be parted. Because Eagle\r\nFeather must grow up as a Sauk. The people would need him, too, in\r\nsummers and winters to come.\r\n\r\nBut until Eagle Feather was grown, the people would turn to her. The\r\nmen, like Wolf Paw, had lost heart. She would give them heart again.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the pale eyes, the Sauk would find a good trail.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe walk from Grandpapa's house to the ruins of Victoire seemed to\r\nAuguste to take all morning. By the time he stood facing the blackened\r\nchimney that towered over him like some ancient idol, his legs hurt. He\r\nwas panting, but the crisp winter air infused vigor into his nostrils\r\nand lungs. He sat down to rest on a broken beam that had once held up\r\nthe ceiling of the great hall.\r\n\r\nHe was still weak from having been so badly wounded and from lying in\r\nbed recovering. And even now his left lung was still not able to fill\r\nitself full with air, and probably never would be.\r\n\r\nThis was the farthest he had ever walked. Too far, really. But the\r\nbright December day invited him out of doors, and he wanted to see his\r\nland.\r\n\r\n_My land._\r\n\r\nIt was his now, without question. Now that Raoul's body had been found.\r\n\r\nHe was glad there had been no marks on the body. Glad that the Fleming\r\nchildren, who had found it day before yesterday while playing down in\r\nthe gorge, hadn't had to see a human body torn to pieces, as he feared\r\nRaoul might be found.\r\n\r\nGinnie, the middle Fleming girl, had followed a cardinal into the mine\r\nentrance; once the child had seen the body, the little redbird had flown\r\nout again and disappeared.\r\n\r\nRaoul's rifle and his pistol, both of which he apparently had fired just\r\nbefore he died, lay beside him. His Bowie knife had fallen a short\r\ndistance away, as if he had thrown it.\r\n\r\nWhen Auguste and Grandpapa had gone to see the body laid out in Dr.\r\nSurrey's examining room, Auguste had been shocked to see the grimace of\r\nterror frozen on Raoul's face--jaws wide apart, lips drawn back from his\r\nteeth, eyes bulging. A good thing the light in the mine had been dim and\r\nthe Fleming girl hadn't gotten a good look at that face.\r\n\r\nAuguste and Dr. Surrey had both carefully examined the body and could\r\nfind no cause of death. Surrey opined that Raoul had gone mad hiding in\r\nthe mine and had been frightened to death by his own hallucinations.\r\n\r\nAuguste knew what had killed Raoul. He vividly remembered his wanderings\r\nin the other world, in that endless prairie, with Redbird.\r\n\r\nAuguste could only imagine what the encounter between Raoul and the\r\nWhite Bear had been like. It had taken place in the other world. The\r\nWhite Bear spirit must have attacked and destroyed Raoul's soul--if a\r\nsoul could be destroyed. Like the men on spirit journeys who died\r\nbecause their souls never returned to their bodies, Raoul's body had\r\nbeen deprived of life. The White Bear could leave its mark in this world\r\nwhen it chose, but usually it left tangible signs as a mark of favor.\r\nThis time the only mark it had left was that look of terror on Raoul's\r\ndead face.\r\n\r\nAnd Auguste had paid the price for having sent the White Bear against\r\nRaoul: he had lost Redbird.\r\n\r\n_For the rest of my life I will never see a cardinal without my heart\r\nbreaking all over again._\r\n\r\nThey would bury Raoul, with a mass, in the little cemetery overlooking\r\nthe river, just like any other member of the de Marion family. There\r\nwould be no revenge after death. Père Isaac was coming up from Kaskaskia\r\nto officiate.\r\n\r\n_And I'm afraid it will not be long before Grandpapa lies down to rest\r\nnot far from Raoul._\r\n\r\nEven as Auguste had begun to get out of bed and walk about, Elysée\r\nseemed to be spending more and more time sleeping. One day, Auguste\r\nexpected, he would simply not wake up at all. Though he mourned in\r\nexpectation of the old man's passing, it was with a warm feeling that\r\nElysée had done much, had walked a long trail with honor. It was now\r\nright that his spirit move on and his body return to the earth.\r\n\r\n_I am thinking like a Sauk._\r\n\r\nAnd then it all swept over him in a wave of anguish. He saw the\r\nhappiness he had lost. He saw the gardens and long houses of Saukenuk,\r\ncool and pleasant in the summer, the snow-covered, warm winter wickiups\r\nin Ioway. The hunting and fishing, the feasts, the dances. The beloved\r\nfaces drew close before his eyes--Sun Woman, Floating Lily, Eagle\r\nFeather, Owl Carver, Black Hawk.\r\n\r\nRedbird.\r\n\r\nHe gave an agonized shout that reverberated in the stone chimney that\r\ntowered over him. He beat his chest with his fist again and again, until\r\na bolt of pain shot through him where Raoul's bullet had pierced him. He\r\ndid not want to stop hurting himself, but he could not hit his chest\r\nanymore. His head hung down and he sobbed brokenly.\r\n\r\nHe had sacrificed too much. He had given up everything he really loved\r\nto become a prisoner of this place. He was trapped on this land. The\r\nancient wealth of the de Marions held him in golden chains.\r\n\r\n_I could ride away from all this, even now. I could take a horse and\r\nswim it across the Mississippi--the Great River--and I could find the\r\nSauk and live with them again. I could be free._\r\n\r\nRedbird had said she had become Wolf Paw's woman. Anger boiled him at\r\nthe thought of that. But he knew it was the healer in her who had chosen\r\nthat path. As she had said, Wolf Paw was one of the last braves of the\r\nBritish Band, and by healing him she healed the people.\r\n\r\nAnd was he not lying to himself to think he could do anything for the\r\nSauk here? How could he resist the immense power of men like Sharp\r\nKnife, who, he was sure, were bent on exterminating the Sauk, on\r\nexterminating all the red people on this continent?\r\n\r\nTo make the de Marion estate prosper he would have to learn to perform a\r\nthousand tasks about which he knew almost nothing. He must give all his\r\nheart and mind and strength to this domain if it was to flourish. That\r\nwas the burden Star Arrow, Pierre de Marion, had laid on him. In taking\r\nup that burden, might he not forget his other tie, to the Sauk, so far\r\naway?\r\n\r\nBut it was his being a Sauk that chained him so irrevocably to\r\nVictoire--the afternoon he smoked the calumet with Star Arrow--the\r\nTurtle calling on him to be guardian of this land.\r\n\r\nSomehow he must try both to be master of Victoire and to fulfill his\r\ndestiny as a Sauk.\r\n\r\n_This land, right here, once belonged to my people. If I leave it, it\r\nwill never belong to them again._\r\n\r\n_I will dedicate my possessions to them. I will send them what they\r\nneed. I will use the influence my wealth gives me with the lawyers and\r\npoliticians to protect them, so they will never be driven from their\r\nland again, never be massacred again._\r\n\r\nHe stood up and walked away from the charred wreckage of Victoire into\r\nthe fields that surrounded it. The farmhands had planted corn last\r\nspring, but the Sauk raiders had burned it, and some prairie grass had\r\ncome back. It had only had time to grow chest high before the frost\r\nkilled it, and as he pushed his way through it he could see fields\r\nbeyond, where the yellow horizon met the sky.\r\n\r\nNancy would share this land with him. She would love him, and they would\r\nraise Woodrow together and have children of their own. He loved Nancy,\r\nthough there were places in him that only Redbird could touch. Those\r\nplaces would be sealed off now. Hand in hand Nancy and he would walk\r\ntheir path together.\r\n\r\n    The World was all before them, where to choose\r\n    Their place of rest, and Providence their guide:\r\n    They hand in hand with wand'ring steps and slow,\r\n    Through Eden took their solitary way.\r\n\r\nBut he would never stop missing Redbird and Eagle Feather.\r\n\r\nAnd he would never stop wishing he could live out his life as a Sauk.\r\nInwardly he would always be a Sauk. The Bear spirit would always be with\r\nhim to guide him.\r\n\r\n_I failed the Sauk when they needed me. I warned them not to go to war,\r\nbut I could not make them listen. They need a shaman who will make them\r\nlisten._\r\n\r\nHe thought of the many, more than a thousand, who had died following\r\nBlack Hawk, and a sudden, crushing grief struck him to his knees.\r\n\r\n\"Hu-hu-hu-u-u-u-u,\" he wailed, stretching his arms wide and lifting his\r\nface up to look at long, faint streaks of cloud that stretched across\r\nthe sky. \"Whu-whu-whu-u-u-u-u.\"\r\n\r\nHe tore open his coat and his shirt. Kneeling, he could see only a patch\r\nof blue directly overhead, framed by the tassels of the prairie grass\r\nthat rose up all around him. Staring up into the blue he wailed for the\r\ndead for a long time.\r\n\r\nHe felt something wet running down his chest. He felt the cold grip of\r\nfear on his heart. When he had struck his breast before, had he reopened\r\nthe hole Raoul's bullet made?\r\n\r\nHe looked down. Beads of dark red were pushing their way through the\r\nfive claw scars. Further down his chest they ran together as rivulets.\r\nFive streams of blood trickled down his stomach.\r\n\r\nThe sight of flowing blood lifted his heart. It was a sign that the Bear\r\nspirit was still with him. He bent forward and put out his hands to grip\r\nthe land at the roots of the prairie grass. His fingers dug into the\r\nashes of corn stalks and the roots of grass. A bright red spot appeared\r\non the ground between his hands and knees, and then another.\r\n\r\n_My blood drips into the soil. I give myself to this land._\r\n\r\n\"I hold this land for the Sauk nation,\" he said. First he said it in\r\nSauk, then he repeated it again in English.\r\n\r\nHe pushed himself to his feet and drew from its sheath at his waist the\r\nknife Star Arrow had left him long ago.\r\n\r\nStanding, he could see over the waving grass. He flourished the knife\r\nblade at the vast dome of sky covering the prairie. He faced toward the\r\neast, whence came those waves of pale eyes that had driven his people\r\nfrom their homes. Whence, too, had come his father and one of his\r\ngrandfathers.\r\n\r\nThe last Sauk shaman this side of the Great River held up his knife so\r\nthe sun glinted from it.\r\n\r\n\"I will defend this land!\" he shouted.\r\n\r\nAs long as he lived, he would give his blood to this earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfterword\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reader may suspect the author of a bit of frontier-style\r\nexaggeration, with one President and three future Presidents--two of the\r\nUnited States and one of the Confederacy--playing parts in this novel.\r\nBut it's a historic fact that Colonel Zachary Taylor and Lieutenant\r\nJefferson Davis were among the regular Army officers who pursued Black\r\nHawk's people. The two ultimately drew even closer, when Davis married\r\nTaylor's daughter Sarah. Davis resigned from the military and took his\r\nnew bride back to Mississippi, where they settled on a plantation. But\r\nthe daughter of U.S. President Zachary Taylor was not to be First Lady\r\nof the Confederacy; she died of malaria a few months after the wedding.\r\nAnd after the Civil War Jefferson Davis saw the inside of Fort Monroe\r\nonce again--as a prisoner.\r\n\r\nThe meeting of Andrew Jackson and Black Hawk in the President's\r\nHouse--as the White House was known in 1832--is also an actual\r\nhistorical incident. When Sharp Knife sent the Sauk leaders on a tour of\r\nmajor Eastern cities, including Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York,\r\nthe crowds that came to see Black Hawk greeted him as if he was a\r\nconquering hero, somewhat to Jackson's chagrin. But \"King Andrew,\" as\r\nhis political opponents called him, handily won the election of 1832.\r\nDuring the second four years of his reign Congress enacted into law his\r\npolicy of forcing all Native American tribes in the U.S. to move west of\r\nthe Mississippi. Even though the Winnebago and the Potawatomi remained\r\nneutral or actively helped the Americans, they also had to give up their\r\nland in Illinois and Wisconsin and move westward.\r\n\r\nAbraham Lincoln, aged twenty-three, joined the Illinois militia in April\r\n1832, and was promptly elected captain of the Sangamon County company of\r\nvolunteers. In May, Lincoln was one of those who helped bury the slain\r\nmilitiamen at Old Man's Creek. When his company was disbanded, the men\r\nhaving served their four weeks' enlistment, Lincoln signed up for two\r\nmore short hitches. He served them as a private, and was finally\r\nmustered out in July. His horse was stolen, and he and a friend walked\r\nand canoed 250 miles southward to their home, in New Salem, Illinois.\r\nThough Black Hawk War veterans tended to make much of their exploits,\r\nLincoln was content to say afterward that the only combat he saw was\r\nagainst flies and mosquitoes. Thomas Ford, Auguste's attorney, served as\r\ngovernor of Illinois from 1842 to 1846. His _History of Illinois_,\r\nwritten in 1847, is one of the sources for this novel.\r\n\r\nOther than Black Hawk himself, the most historically prominent Sauk in\r\nthese pages is He Who Moves Alertly. For the sake of consistency I've\r\ntranslated all the Native American names in the novel into English.\r\nOtherwise you'd have met He Who Moves Alertly under the name he's better\r\nknown by--Keokuk. And I would have referred to Shooting Star, the\r\nShawnee war chief mentioned in Chapters Five and Sixteen, as Tecumseh.\r\nBut then I'd have had to call Black Hawk by his Sauk name,\r\nMakataimeshekiakiak. No wonder Emerson called consistency a hobgoblin.\r\n\r\nAlso an unfamiliar name today is Michigan Territory as a term for the\r\nland north of Illinois through which Black Hawk and his people made\r\ntheir final trek from the Trembling Lands to the mouth of the Bad Axe.\r\nThat land would soon become the state of Wisconsin. After achieving\r\nstatehood in 1848, Wisconsin promptly laid claim to the prosperous\r\nnorthern portion of Illinois, including Chicago; but Illinois\r\npoliticians knew all about clout even then, and beat the Badgers back.\r\n\r\nLarge parts of Illinois and Wisconsin were lands previously occupied by\r\nthe Sauk and Fox. In the seventeenth century the Sauk migrated from\r\nCanada, driven by wars with the Iroquois, down into what is today\r\neastern Wisconsin. During the eighteenth century they formed a\r\nconfederacy with the Fox and moved into the southwestern part of\r\nWisconsin and northern Illinois. In Black Hawk's time there were about\r\nfour thousand Sauk and sixteen hundred Fox, living in villages along the\r\nWisconsin (earlier spelled Ouisconsin) and Mississippi rivers and at the\r\nmouth of the Rock River.\r\n\r\nWith the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, the U.S. took charge of the Sauk\r\nand Fox homeland. In 1804 white settlers attacked a party of Sauk men,\r\nwomen and children, and three whites were killed. As territorial\r\nGovernor William Henry Harrison demanded, a delegation of five Sauk and\r\nFox chiefs brought one of the accused killers to St. Louis. Harrison\r\nused the occasion to negotiate a treaty in which the Sauk and Fox ceded\r\nto the U.S. all their land east of the Mississippi, including what is\r\ntoday northwestern Illinois and southwestern Wisconsin, as well as a\r\nportion of Missouri. All together the Sauk gave up 51 million acres. For\r\nthis they got $2234.50 and an annual payment of $1000 worth of goods.\r\nLater one of the chiefs who had signed the treaty said that the\r\ndelegation had been drunk most of the time they were in St. Louis. The\r\nprisoner the chiefs had delivered to Harrison was \"killed while trying\r\nto escape.\"\r\n\r\nBlack Hawk never recognized this treaty or later confirmations of it. In\r\ndefiance, he led his people back to Saukenuk every spring.\r\n\r\nThere is a gaudy rural playground area in south-central Wisconsin known\r\nas the Wisconsin Dells, where local folks will show tourists a cave in\r\nwhich, they swear, Black Hawk was hiding when captured by two Winnebago\r\nwarriors named Chaetar and One Eye Decorah. But Dr. Nancy O. Lurie of\r\nthe Milwaukee Public Museum has unearthed a different account of Black\r\nHawk's surrender, written by John Blackhawk, grandson of a Winnebago\r\nchief and no relation to the Sauk leader. I find the John Blackhawk\r\nversion much more probable than the Wisconsin Dells story, and it's the\r\none I've followed, adding, inevitably, my own fictional elaborations. Be\r\nit noted that the incident of the small boy who commits Black Hawk's\r\nparty to surrendering by smoking Wave's peace pipe is not my invention,\r\nbut is reported in the John Blackhawk manuscript. Tobacco was that\r\nsacred to the Native Americans of those times.\r\n\r\nAnother matter on which historians disagree is the origin of the\r\nexpression \"O.K.,\" which made its appearance in the American language in\r\nthe 1830s. Here I propose an explanation (see page 239) that I haven't\r\nseen anywhere else, but that, like John Blackhawk's story, makes sense\r\nto me. People at that time attached the adjective \"old\" to anyone or\r\nanything they felt affectionate about--Old Glory, Old Ironsides, Old\r\nHickory. By the time he got around to running for President, Zachary\r\nTaylor was \"Old Rough and Ready.\" The most popular alcoholic beverage in\r\nearly nineteenth-century America was whiskey, and the best whiskey was\r\ndistilled in Kentucky and widely known as Old Kaintuck. It was a jug of\r\nOld Kaintuck that Raoul grudgingly shared with Abe Lincoln. It seems\r\nlikely enough that the nickname Old Kaintuck would in time be shortened\r\nto \"O.K.\"--easier to say after you've had a few--and come to mean the\r\ngood stuff in any area of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the Author\r\n\r\n\r\nRobert Shea is the co-author of the epic fantasy _The Illuminatus!\r\nTrilogy_ and author of the two-volume _Shike_, among other novels.

In this troubled, dangerous\r\ntime, there is a man who has the privilege--and the curse--of belonging\r\nto both worlds. He is Gray Cloud, a disciple of the aging shaman Owl\r\nCarver. A handsome young half-breed, he is chosen by the Great Turtle to\r\nbecome the mystical leader of the Sauk people ... and summoned by his\r\nFrench-born aristocratic father to inherit the vast estate of Victoire.\r\n\r\nHere is the riveting drama of Gray Cloud's transformation into the\r\npowerful shaman White Bear, and his desperate struggle to reconcile the\r\nopposing forces of his white and Indian heritage. It is a sweeping epic\r\nof mysticism and history, of bitter love and brutal warfare, and of the\r\ntragic fate of an ancient people.",
