So she was\r\nconsidering in her own mind, (as well as she could, for the hot\r\nday made her feel very sleepy and stupid,) whether the pleasure\r\nof making a daisy-chain was worth the trouble of getting up and\r\npicking the daisies, when a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close\r\nby her.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing very remarkable in that, nor did Alice think it\r\nso very much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to itself\r\n\"dear, dear! I shall be too late!\" (when she thought it over\r\nafterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at\r\nthis, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the\r\nrabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, looked\r\nat it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it\r\nflashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit\r\nwith either a waistcoat-pocket or a watch to take out of it, and,\r\nfull of curiosity, she hurried across the field after it, and was\r\njust in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the\r\nhedge. In a moment down went Alice after it, never once\r\nconsidering how in the world she was to get out again.\r\n\r\nThe rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and\r\nthen dipped suddenly down, so suddenly, that Alice had not a\r\nmoment to think about stopping herself, before she found herself\r\nfalling down what seemed a deep well. Either the well was very\r\ndeep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she\r\nwent down to look about her, and to wonder what would happen\r\nnext. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was\r\ncoming to, but it was too dark to see anything: then, she looked\r\nat the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with\r\ncupboards and book-shelves: here and there were maps and pictures\r\nhung on pegs. She took a jar down off one of the shelves as she\r\npassed: it was labelled \"Orange Marmalade,\" but to her great\r\ndisappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar,\r\nfor fear of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it\r\ninto one of the cupboards as she fell past it.\r\n\r\n\"Well!\" thought Alice to herself, \"after such a fall as this, I\r\nshall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll\r\nall think me at home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even\r\nif I fell off the top of the house!\" (which was most likely\r\ntrue.)\r\n\r\nDown, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end? \"I wonder\r\nhow many miles I've fallen by this time?\" she said aloud, \"I must\r\nbe getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see:\r\nthat would be four thousand miles down, I think--\" (for you see\r\nAlice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in\r\nthe schoolroom, and though this was not a very good opportunity\r\nof showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to hear her,\r\nstill it was good practice to say it over,) \"yes that's the right\r\ndistance, but then what Longitude or Latitude-line shall I be\r\nin?\" (Alice had no idea what Longitude was, or Latitude either,\r\nbut she thought they were nice grand words to say.)\r\n\r\nPresently she began again: \"I wonder if I shall fall right\r\nthrough the earth! How funny it'll be to come out among the\r\npeople that walk with their heads downwards! But I shall have to\r\nask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please,\r\nMa'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?\"--and she tried to\r\ncurtsey as she spoke (fancy curtseying as you're falling through\r\nthe air! do you think you could manage it?) \"and what an ignorant\r\nlittle girl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll never do to\r\nask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.\"\r\n\r\nDown, down, down: there was nothing else to do, so Alice soon\r\nbegan talking again. \"Dinah will miss me very much tonight, I\r\nshould think!\" (Dinah was the cat.) \"I hope they'll remember her\r\nsaucer of milk at tea-time! Oh, dear Dinah, I wish I had you\r\nhere! There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might\r\ncatch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know, my dear. But\r\ndo cats eat bats, I wonder?\" And here Alice began to get rather\r\nsleepy, and kept on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way\r\n\"do cats eat bats? do cats eat bats?\" and sometimes, \"do bats\r\neat cats?\" for, as she couldn't answer either question, it didn't\r\nmuch matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing\r\noff, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in\r\nhand with Dinah, and was saying to her very earnestly, \"Now,\r\nDinah, my dear, tell me the truth. Did you ever eat a bat?\" when\r\nsuddenly, bump! bump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and\r\nshavings, and the fall was over.\r\n\r\nAlice was not a bit hurt, and jumped on to her feet directly: she\r\nlooked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another\r\nlong passage, and the white rabbit was still in sight, hurrying\r\ndown it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like\r\nthe wind, and just heard it say, as it turned a corner, \"my ears\r\nand whiskers, how late it's getting!\" She turned the corner after\r\nit, and instantly found herself in a long, low hall, lit up by a\r\nrow of lamps which hung from the roof.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThere were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked,\r\nand when Alice had been all round it, and tried them all, she\r\nwalked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get\r\nout again: suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table,\r\nall made of solid glass; there was nothing lying upon it, but a\r\ntiny golden key, and Alice's first idea was that it might belong\r\nto one of the doors of the hall, but alas! either the locks were\r\ntoo large, or the key too small, but at any rate it would open\r\nnone of them. However, on the second time round, she came to a\r\nlow curtain, behind which was a door about eighteen inches high:\r\nshe tried the little key in the keyhole, and it fitted! Alice\r\nopened the door, and looked down a small passage, not larger than\r\na rat-hole, into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she\r\nlonged to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those\r\nbeds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could\r\nnot even get her head through the doorway, \"and even if my head\r\nwould go through,\" thought poor Alice, \"it would be very little\r\nuse without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a\r\ntelescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.\" For,\r\nyou see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that\r\nAlice began to think very few things indeed were really\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing else to do, so she went back to the table, half\r\nhoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of\r\nrules for shutting up people like telescopes: this time there was\r\na little bottle on it--\"which certainly was not there before\"\r\nsaid Alice--and tied round the neck of the bottle was a paper\r\nlabel with the words DRINK ME beautifully printed on it in large\r\nletters.\r\n\r\nIt was all very well to say \"drink me,\" \"but I'll look first,\"\r\nsaid the wise little Alice, \"and see whether the bottle's marked\r\n\"poison\" or not,\" for Alice had read several nice little stories\r\nabout children that got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts, and\r\nother unpleasant things, because they would not remember the\r\nsimple rules their friends had given them, such as, that, if you\r\nget into the fire, it will burn you, and that, if you cut your\r\nfinger very deeply with a knife, it generally bleeds, and she\r\nhad never forgotten that, if you drink a bottle marked \"poison,\"\r\nit is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.\r\n\r\nHowever, this bottle was not marked poison, so Alice tasted it,\r\nand finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed\r\nflavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffy,\r\nand hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"What a curious feeling!\" said Alice, \"I must be shutting up like\r\na telescope.\"\r\n\r\nIt was so indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face\r\nbrightened up as it occurred to her that she was now the right\r\nsize for going through the little door into that lovely garden.\r\nFirst, however, she waited for a few minutes to see whether she\r\nwas going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about\r\nthis, \"for it might end, you know,\" said Alice to herself, \"in my\r\ngoing out altogether, like a candle, and what should I be like\r\nthen, I wonder?\" and she tried to fancy what the flame of a\r\ncandle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not\r\nremember having ever seen one. However, nothing more happened so\r\nshe decided on going into the garden at once, but, alas for poor\r\nAlice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the\r\nlittle golden key, and when she went back to the table for the\r\nkey, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it\r\nplainly enough through the glass, and she tried her best to climb\r\nup one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery, and\r\nwhen she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing\r\nsat down and cried.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Come! there's no use in crying!\" said Alice to herself rather\r\nsharply, \"I advise you to leave off this minute!\" (she generally\r\ngave herself very good advice, and sometimes scolded herself so\r\nseverely as to bring tears into her eyes, and once she remembered\r\nboxing her own ears for having been unkind to herself in a game\r\nof croquet she was playing with herself, for this curious child\r\nwas very fond of pretending to be two people,) \"but it's no use\r\nnow,\" thought poor Alice, \"to pretend to be two people! Why,\r\nthere's hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person!\"\r\n\r\nSoon her eyes fell on a little ebony box lying under the table:\r\nshe opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which was\r\nlying a card with the words EAT ME beautifully printed on it in\r\nlarge letters. \"I'll eat,\" said Alice, \"and if it makes me\r\nlarger, I can reach the key, and if it makes me smaller, I can\r\ncreep under the door, so either way I'll get into the garden, and\r\nI don't care which happens!\"\r\n\r\nShe ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself \"which way?\r\nwhich way?\" and laid her hand on the top of her head to feel\r\nwhich way it was growing, and was quite surprised to find that\r\nshe remained the same size: to be sure this is what generally\r\nhappens when one eats cake, but Alice had got into the way of\r\nexpecting nothing but out-of-the way things to happen, and it\r\nseemed quite dull and stupid for things to go on in the common\r\nway.\r\n\r\nSo she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Curiouser and curiouser!\" cried Alice, (she was so surprised\r\nthat she quite forgot how to speak good English,) \"now I'm\r\nopening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Goodbye,\r\nfeet!\" (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed almost\r\nout of sight, they were getting so far off,) \"oh, my poor little\r\nfeet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you\r\nnow, dears? I'm sure I can't! I shall be a great deal too far off\r\nto bother myself about you: you must manage the best way you\r\ncan--but I must be kind to them,\" thought Alice, \"or perhaps they\r\nwon't walk the way I want to go! Let me see: I'll give them a new\r\npair of boots every Christmas.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAnd she went on planning to herself how she would manage it\r\n\"they must go by the carrier,\" she thought, \"and how funny it'll\r\nseem, sending presents to one's own feet! And how odd the\r\ndirections will look! ALICE'S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ.\r\n                            THE CARPET,\r\n                              with ALICE'S LOVE\r\n\r\noh dear! what nonsense I am talking!\"\r\n\r\nJust at this moment, her head struck against the roof of the\r\nhall: in fact, she was now rather more than nine feet high, and\r\nshe at once took up the little golden key, and hurried off to the\r\ngarden door.\r\n\r\nPoor Alice! it was as much as she could do, lying down on one\r\nside, to look through into the garden with one eye, but to get\r\nthrough was more hopeless than ever: she sat down and cried\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\"You ought to be ashamed of yourself,\" said Alice, \"a great girl\r\nlike you,\" (she might well say this,) \"to cry in this way! Stop\r\nthis instant, I tell you!\" But she cried on all the same,\r\nshedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool, about\r\nfour inches deep, all round her, and reaching half way across the\r\nhall. After a time, she heard a little pattering of feet in the\r\ndistance, and dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the\r\nwhite rabbit coming back again, splendidly dressed, with a pair\r\nof white kid gloves in one hand, and a nosegay in the other.\r\nAlice was ready to ask help of any one, she felt so desperate,\r\nand as the rabbit passed her, she said, in a low, timid voice,\r\n\"If you please, Sir--\" the rabbit started violently, looked up\r\nonce into the roof of the hall, from which the voice seemed to\r\ncome, and then dropped the nosegay and the white kid gloves, and\r\nskurried away into the darkness, as hard as it could go.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAlice took up the nosegay and gloves, and found the nosegay so\r\ndelicious that she kept smelling at it all the time she went on\r\ntalking to herself--\"dear, dear! how queer everything is today!\r\nand yesterday everything happened just as usual: I wonder if I\r\nwas changed in the night? Let me think: was I the same when I got\r\nup this morning? I think I remember feeling rather different.\r\nBut if I'm not the same, who in the world am I? Ah, that's the\r\ngreat puzzle!\" And she began thinking over all the children she\r\nknew of the same age as herself, to see if she could have been\r\nchanged for any of them.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure I'm not Gertrude,\" she said, \"for her hair goes in such\r\nlong ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all--and I'm\r\nsure I ca'n't be Florence, for I know all sorts of things, and\r\nshe, oh! she knows such a very little! Besides, she's she, and\r\nI'm I, and--oh dear! how puzzling it all is! I'll try if I know\r\nall the things I used to know. Let me see: four times five is\r\ntwelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is\r\nfourteen--oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at this rate! But\r\nthe Multiplication Table don't signify--let's try Geography.\r\nLondon is the capital of France, and Rome is the capital of\r\nYorkshire, and Paris--oh dear! dear! that's all wrong, I'm\r\ncertain! I must have been changed for Florence! I'll try and say\r\n\"How doth the little,\"\" and she crossed her hands on her lap,\r\nand began, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the\r\nwords did not sound the same as they used to do:\r\n\r\n    \"How doth the little crocodile\r\n      Improve its shining tail,\r\n    And pour the waters of the Nile\r\n      On every golden scale!\r\n\r\n    \"How cheerfully it seems to grin!\r\n      How neatly spreads its claws!\r\n    And welcomes little fishes in\r\n      With gently-smiling jaws!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure those are not the right words,\" said poor Alice, and\r\nher eyes filled with tears as she thought \"I must be Florence\r\nafter all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little\r\nhouse, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so\r\nmany lessons to learn! No! I've made up my mind about it: if I'm\r\nFlorence, I'll stay down here! It'll be no use their putting\r\ntheir heads down and saying 'come up, dear!' I shall only look\r\nup and say 'who am I then? answer me that first, and then, if I\r\nlike being that person, I'll come up: if not, I'll stay down here\r\ntill I'm somebody else--but, oh dear!\" cried Alice with a sudden\r\nburst of tears, \"I do wish they would put their heads down! I am\r\nso tired of being all alone here!\"\r\n\r\nAs she said this, she looked down at her hands, and was surprised\r\nto find she had put on one of the rabbit's little gloves while\r\nshe was talking. \"How can I have done that?\" thought she, \"I must\r\nbe growing small again.\" She got up and went to the table to\r\nmeasure herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could\r\nguess, she was now about two feet high, and was going on\r\nshrinking rapidly: soon she found out that the reason of it was\r\nthe nosegay she held in her hand: she dropped it hastily, just in\r\ntime to save herself from shrinking away altogether, and found\r\nthat she was now only three inches high.\r\n\r\n\"Now for the garden!\" cried Alice, as she hurried back to the\r\nlittle door, but the little door was locked again, and the little\r\ngold key was lying on the glass table as before, and \"things are\r\nworse than ever!\" thought the poor little girl, \"for I never was\r\nas small as this before, never! And I declare it's too bad, it\r\nis!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAt this moment her foot slipped, and splash! she was up to her\r\nchin in salt water. Her first idea was that she had fallen into\r\nthe sea: then she remembered that she was under ground, and she\r\nsoon made out that it was the pool of tears she had wept when she\r\nwas nine feet high. \"I wish I hadn't cried so much!\" said Alice,\r\nas she swam about, trying to find her way out, \"I shall be\r\npunished for it now, I suppose, by being drowned in my own tears!\r\nWell! that'll be a queer thing, to be sure! However, every thing\r\nis queer today.\" Very soon she saw something splashing about in\r\nthe pool near her: at first she thought it must be a walrus or a\r\nhippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she was herself,\r\nand soon made out that it was only a mouse, that had slipped in\r\nlike herself.\r\n\r\n\"Would it be any use, now,\" thought Alice, \"to speak to this\r\nmouse? The rabbit is something quite out-of-the-way, no doubt,\r\nand so have I been, ever since I came down here, but that is no\r\nreason why the mouse should not be able to talk. I think I may as\r\nwell try.\"\r\n\r\nSo she began: \"oh Mouse, do you know how to get out of this pool?\r\nI am very tired of swimming about here, oh Mouse!\" The mouse\r\nlooked at her rather inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink\r\nwith one of its little eyes, but it said nothing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps it doesn't understand English,\" thought Alice; \"I\r\ndaresay it's a French mouse, come over with William the\r\nConqueror!\" (for, with all her knowledge of history, Alice had\r\nno very clear notion how long ago anything had happened,) so she\r\nbegan again: \"où est ma chatte?\" which was the first sentence out\r\nof her French lesson-book. The mouse gave a sudden jump in the\r\npool, and seemed to quiver with fright: \"oh, I beg your pardon!\"\r\ncried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor animal's\r\nfeelings, \"I quite forgot you didn't like cats!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not like cats!\" cried the mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice,\r\n\"would you like cats if you were me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, perhaps not,\" said Alice in a soothing tone, \"don't be\r\nangry about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I\r\nthink you'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She\r\nis such a dear quiet thing,\" said Alice, half to herself, as she\r\nswam lazily about in the pool, \"she sits purring so nicely by the\r\nfire, licking her paws and washing her face: and she is such a\r\nnice soft thing to nurse, and she's such a capital one for\r\ncatching mice--oh! I beg your pardon!\" cried poor Alice again,\r\nfor this time the mouse was bristling all over, and she felt\r\ncertain that it was really offended, \"have I offended you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Offended indeed!\" cried the mouse, who seemed to be positively\r\ntrembling with rage, \"our family always hated cats! Nasty, low,\r\nvulgar things! Don't talk to me about them any more!\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't indeed!\" said Alice, in a great hurry to change the\r\nconversation, \"are you--are you--fond of--dogs?\" The mouse did\r\nnot answer, so Alice went on eagerly: \"there is such a nice\r\nlittle dog near our house I should like to show you! A little\r\nbright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh! such long curly brown\r\nhair! And it'll fetch things when you throw them, and it'll sit\r\nup and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things--I ca'n't\r\nremember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer, and he says it\r\nkills all the rats and--oh dear!\" said Alice sadly, \"I'm afraid\r\nI've offended it again!\" for the mouse was swimming away from her\r\nas hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the pool\r\nas it went.\r\n\r\nSo she called softly after it: \"mouse dear! Do come back again,\r\nand we won't talk about cats and dogs any more, if you don't like\r\nthem!\" When the mouse heard this, it turned and swam slowly back\r\nto her: its face was quite pale, (with passion, Alice thought,)\r\nand it said in a trembling low voice \"let's get to the shore, and\r\nthen I'll tell you my history, and you'll understand why it is I\r\nhate cats and dogs.\"\r\n\r\nIt was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite full of\r\nbirds and animals that had fallen into it. There was a Duck and a\r\nDodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures.\r\nAlice led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nThey were indeed a curious looking party that assembled on the\r\nbank--the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their\r\nfur clinging close to them--all dripping wet, cross, and\r\nuncomfortable. The first question of course was, how to get dry:\r\nthey had a consultation about this, and Alice hardly felt at all\r\nsurprised at finding herself talking familiarly with the birds,\r\nas if she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a\r\nlong argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would\r\nonly say \"I am older than you, and must know best,\" and this\r\nAlice would not admit without knowing how old the Lory was, and\r\nas the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was nothing\r\nmore to be said.\r\n\r\nAt last the mouse, who seemed to have some authority among them,\r\ncalled out \"sit down, all of you, and attend to me! I'll soon\r\nmake you dry enough!\" They all sat down at once, shivering, in a\r\nlarge ring, Alice in the middle, with her eyes anxiously fixed on\r\nthe mouse, for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she\r\ndid not get dry very soon.\r\n\r\n\"Ahem!\" said the mouse, with a self-important air, \"are you all\r\nready? This is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you\r\nplease!\r\n\r\n\"William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was\r\nsoon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had\r\nbeen of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin\r\nand Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria--\"\r\n\r\n\"Ugh!\" said the Lory with a shiver.\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon?\" said the mouse, frowning, but very politely,\r\n\"did you speak?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not I!\" said the Lory hastily.\r\n\r\n\"I thought you did,\" said the mouse, \"I proceed. Edwin and\r\nMorcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him;\r\nand even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found\r\nit advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer\r\nhim the crown. William's conduct was at first moderate--how are\r\nyou getting on now, dear?\" said the mouse, turning to Alice as it\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\n\"As wet as ever,\" said poor Alice, \"it doesn't seem to dry me at\r\nall.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case,\" said the Dodo solemnly, rising to his feet, \"I\r\nmove that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more\r\nenergetic remedies--\"\r\n\r\n\"Speak English!\" said the Duck, \"I don't know the meaning of half\r\nthose long words, and what's more, I don't believe you do\r\neither!\" And the Duck quacked a comfortable laugh to itself. Some\r\nof the other birds tittered audibly.\r\n\r\n\"I only meant to say,\" said the Dodo in a rather offended tone,\r\n\"that I know of a house near here, where we could get the young\r\nlady and the rest of the party dried, and then we could listen\r\ncomfortably to the story which I think you were good enough to\r\npromise to tell us,\" bowing gravely to the mouse.\r\n\r\nThe mouse made no objection to this, and the whole party moved\r\nalong the river bank, (for the pool had by this time began to\r\nflow out of the hall, and the edge of it was fringed with rushes\r\nand forget-me-nots,) in a slow procession, the Dodo leading the\r\nway. After a time the Dodo became impatient, and, leaving the\r\nDuck to bring up the rest of the party, moved on at a quicker\r\npace with Alice, the Lory, and the Eaglet, and soon brought them\r\nto a little cottage, and there they sat snugly by the fire,\r\nwrapped up in blankets, until the rest of the party had arrived,\r\nand they were all dry again.\r\n\r\nThen they all sat down again in a large ring on the bank, and\r\nbegged the mouse to begin his story.\r\n\r\n\"Mine is a long and a sad tale!\" said the mouse, turning to\r\nAlice, and sighing.\r\n\r\n\"It is a long tail, certainly,\" said Alice, looking down with\r\nwonder at the mouse's tail, which was coiled nearly all round the\r\nparty, \"but why do you call it sad?\" and she went on puzzling\r\nabout this as the mouse went on speaking, so that her idea of the\r\ntale was something like this:\r\n\r\nWe lived beneath the mat\r\n       Warm and snug and fat\r\n              But one woe, & that\r\n                       Was the cat!\r\n                           To our joys\r\n                            a clog, In\r\n                           our eyes a\r\n                       fog, On our\r\n                  hearts a log\r\n               Was the dog!\r\n              When the\r\n       cat's away,\r\n     Then\r\n   the mice\r\n   will\r\n     play,\r\n       But, alas!\r\n         one day, (So they say)\r\n              Came the dog and\r\n                        cat, Hunting\r\n                                for a\r\n                                  rat,\r\n                             Crushed\r\n                          the mice\r\n                      all flat;\r\n                      Each\r\n                     one\r\n                     as\r\n                     he\r\n                     sat.\r\n                       U\r\n                        n\r\n                         d\r\n                          e\r\n                           r\r\n                            n\r\n                             e\r\n                              a\r\n                               t\r\n                                h\r\n\r\n                                t\r\n                                h\r\n                                e\r\n\r\n                              m\r\n                             a\r\n                            t\r\n                           ,\r\n                   m r a W\r\n            g u n s &\r\n       t a f &\r\n   T h i n k?\r\no f t h a t!\r\n\r\n\"You are not attending!\" said the mouse to Alice severely, \"what\r\nare you thinking of?\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said Alice very humbly, \"you had got to the\r\nfifth bend, I think?\"\r\n\r\n\"I had not!\" cried the mouse, sharply and very angrily.\r\n\r\n\"A knot!\" said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and\r\nlooking anxiously about her, \"oh, do let me help to undo it!\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall do nothing of the sort!\" said the mouse, getting up and\r\nwalking away from the party, \"you insult me by talking such\r\nnonsense!\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't mean it!\" pleaded poor Alice, \"but you're so easily\r\noffended, you know.\"\r\n\r\nThe mouse only growled in reply.\r\n\r\n\"Please come back and finish your story!\" Alice called after it,\r\nand the others all joined in chorus \"yes, please do!\" but the\r\nmouse only shook its ears, and walked quickly away, and was soon\r\nout of sight.\r\n\r\n\"What a pity it wouldn't stay!\" sighed the Lory, and an old Crab\r\ntook the opportunity of saying to its daughter \"Ah, my dear! let\r\nthis be a lesson to you never to lose your temper!\" \"Hold your\r\ntongue, Ma!\" said the young Crab, a little snappishly, \"you're\r\nenough to try the patience of an oyster!\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!\" said Alice aloud,\r\naddressing no one in particular, \"she'd soon fetch it back!\"\r\n\r\n\"And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?\" said\r\nthe Lory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAlice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her\r\npet, \"Dinah's our cat. And she's such a capital one for catching\r\nmice, you can't think! And oh! I wish you could see her after the\r\nbirds! Why, she'll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!\"\r\n\r\nThis answer caused a remarkable sensation among the party: some\r\nof the birds hurried off at once; one old magpie began wrapping\r\nitself up very carefully, remarking \"I really must be getting\r\nhome: the night air does not suit my throat,\" and a canary called\r\nout in a trembling voice to its children \"come away from her, my\r\ndears, she's no fit company for you!\" On various pretexts, they\r\nall moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nShe sat for some while sorrowful and silent, but she was not long\r\nbefore she recovered her spirits, and began talking to herself\r\nagain as usual: \"I do wish some of them had stayed a little\r\nlonger! and I was getting to be such friends with them--really\r\nthe Lory and I were almost like sisters! and so was that dear\r\nlittle Eaglet! And then the Duck and the Dodo! How nicely the\r\nDuck sang to us as we came along through the water: and if the\r\nDodo hadn't known the way to that nice little cottage, I don't\r\nknow when we should have got dry again--\" and there is no knowing\r\nhow long she might have prattled on in this way, if she had not\r\nsuddenly caught the sound of pattering feet.\r\n\r\nIt was the white rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking\r\nanxiously about it as it went, as if it had lost something, and she\r\nheard it muttering to itself \"the Marchioness! the Marchioness! oh\r\nmy dear paws! oh my fur and whiskers! She'll have me executed, as\r\nsure as ferrets are ferrets! Where can I have dropped them, I\r\nwonder?\" Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the\r\nnosegay and the pair of white kid gloves, and she began hunting for\r\nthem, but they were now nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to\r\nhave changed since her swim in the pool, and her walk along the\r\nriver-bank with its fringe of rushes and forget-me-nots, and the\r\nglass table and the little door had vanished.\r\n\r\nSoon the rabbit noticed Alice, as she stood looking curiously\r\nabout her, and at once said in a quick angry tone, \"why, Mary\r\nAnn! what are you doing out here? Go home this moment, and look\r\non my dressing-table for my gloves and nosegay, and fetch them\r\nhere, as quick as you can run, do you hear?\" and Alice was so\r\nmuch frightened that she ran off at once, without saying a word,\r\nin the direction which the rabbit had pointed out.\r\n\r\nShe soon found herself in front of a neat little house, on the\r\ndoor of which was a bright brass plate with the name W. RABBIT,\r\nESQ. She went in, and hurried upstairs, for fear she should meet\r\nthe real Mary Ann and be turned out of the house before she had\r\nfound the gloves: she knew that one pair had been lost in the\r\nhall, \"but of course,\" thought Alice, \"it has plenty more of them\r\nin its house. How queer it seems to be going messages for a\r\nrabbit! I suppose Dinah'll be sending me messages next!\" And she\r\nbegan fancying the sort of things that would happen: \"Miss Alice!\r\ncome here directly and get ready for your walk!\" \"Coming in a\r\nminute, nurse! but I've got to watch this mousehole till Dinah\r\ncomes back, and see that the mouse doesn't get out--\" \"only I\r\ndon't think,\" Alice went on, \"that they'd let Dinah stop in the\r\nhouse, if it began ordering people about like that!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBy this time she had found her way into a tidy little room, with a\r\ntable in the window on which was a looking-glass and, (as Alice had\r\nhoped,) two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up a\r\npair of gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye\r\nfell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass: there\r\nwas no label on it this time with the words \"drink me,\" but\r\nnonetheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips: \"I know\r\nsomething interesting is sure to happen,\" she said to herself,\r\n\"whenever I eat or drink anything, so I'll see what this bottle\r\ndoes. I do hope it'll make me grow larger, for I'm quite tired of\r\nbeing such a tiny little thing!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt did so indeed, and much sooner than she expected: before she\r\nhad drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against\r\nthe ceiling, and she stooped to save her neck from being broken,\r\nand hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself \"that's quite\r\nenough--I hope I sha'n't grow any more--I wish I hadn't drunk so\r\nmuch!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAlas! it was too late: she went on growing and growing, and very\r\nsoon had to kneel down: in another minute there was not room even\r\nfor this, and she tried the effect of lying down, with one elbow\r\nagainst the door, and the other arm curled round her head. Still\r\nshe went on growing, and as a last resource she put one arm out\r\nof the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself\r\n\"now I can do no more--what will become of me?\"\r\n\r\nLuckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full\r\neffect, and she grew no larger; still it was very uncomfortable,\r\nand as there seemed to be no sort of chance of ever getting out\r\nof the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy. \"It was much\r\npleasanter at home,\" thought poor Alice, \"when one wasn't always\r\ngrowing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and\r\nrabbits--I almost wish I hadn't gone down that rabbit-hole, and\r\nyet, and yet--it's rather curious, you know, this sort of life. I\r\ndo wonder what can have happened to me! When I used to read\r\nfairy-tales, I fancied that sort of thing never happened, and now\r\nhere I am in the middle of one! There out to be a book written\r\nabout me, that there ought! and when I grow up I'll write\r\none--but I'm grown up now\" said she in a sorrowful tone, \"at\r\nleast there's no room to grow up any more here.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"But then,\" thought Alice, \"shall I never get any older than I\r\nam now? That'll be a comfort, one way--never to be an old\r\nwoman--but then--always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn't\r\nlike that!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you foolish Alice!\" she said again, \"how can you learn\r\nlessons in here? Why, there's hardly room for you, and no room at\r\nall for any lesson-books!\"\r\n\r\nAnd so she went on, taking first one side, and then the other,\r\nand making quite a conversation of it altogether, but after a few\r\nminutes she heard a voice outside, which made her stop to listen.\r\n\r\n\"Mary Ann! Mary Ann!\" said the voice, \"fetch me my gloves this\r\nmoment!\" Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs:\r\nAlice knew it was the rabbit coming to look for her, and she\r\ntrembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she was\r\nnow about a thousand times as large as the rabbit, and had no\r\nreason to be afraid of it. Presently the rabbit came to the door,\r\nand tried to open it, but as it opened inwards, and Alice's elbow\r\nwas against it, the attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say\r\nto itself \"then I'll go round and get in at the window.\"\r\n\r\n\"That you wo'n't!\" thought Alice, and, after waiting till she\r\nfancied she heard the rabbit, just under the window, she suddenly\r\nspread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not\r\nget hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall\r\nand a crash of breaking glass, from which she concluded that it\r\nwas just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or\r\nsomething of the sort.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNext came an angry voice--the rabbit's--\"Pat, Pat! where are\r\nyou?\" And then a voice she had never heard before, \"shure then\r\nI'm here! digging for apples, anyway, yer honour!\"\r\n\r\n\"Digging for apples indeed!\" said the rabbit angrily, \"here, come\r\nand help me out of this!\"--Sound of more breaking glass.\r\n\r\n\"Now, tell me, Pat, what is that coming out of the window?\"\r\n\r\n\"Shure it's an arm, yer honour!\" (He pronounced it \"arrum\".)\r\n\r\n\"An arm, you goose! Who ever saw an arm that size? Why, it fills\r\nthe whole window, don't you see?\"\r\n\r\n\"Shure, it does, yer honour, but it's an arm for all that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's no business there: go and take it away!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear\r\nwhispers now and then, such as \"shure I don't like it, yer\r\nhonour, at all at all!\" \"do as I tell you, you coward!\" and at\r\nlast she spread out her hand again and made another snatch in the\r\nair. This time there were two little shrieks, and more breaking\r\nglass--\"what a number of cucumber-frames there must be!\" thought\r\nAlice, \"I wonder what they'll do next! As for pulling me out of\r\nthe window, I only wish they could! I'm sure I don't want to stop\r\nin here any longer!\"\r\n\r\nShe waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last\r\ncame a rumbling of little cart-wheels, and the sound of a good\r\nmany voices all talking together: she made out the words \"where's\r\nthe other ladder?--why, I hadn't to bring but one, Bill's got the\r\nother--here, put 'em up at this corner--no, tie 'em together\r\nfirst--they don't reach high enough yet--oh, they'll do well\r\nenough, don't be particular--here, Bill! catch hold of this\r\nrope--will the roof bear?--mind that loose slate--oh, it's coming\r\ndown! heads below!--\" (a loud crash) \"now, who did that?--it was\r\nBill, I fancy--who's to go down the chimney?--nay, I sha'n't! you\r\ndo it!--that I won't then--Bill's got to go down--here, Bill! the\r\nmaster says you've to go down the chimney!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, so Bill's got to come down the chimney, has he?\" said Alice\r\nto herself, \"why, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I\r\nwouldn't be in Bill's place for a good deal: the fireplace is a\r\npretty tight one, but I think I can kick a little!\"\r\n\r\nShe drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and\r\nwaited till she heard a little animal (she couldn't guess what\r\nsort it was) scratching and scrambling in the chimney close above\r\nher: then, saying to herself \"this is Bill,\" she gave one sharp\r\nkick, and waited again to see what would happen next.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe first thing was a general chorus of \"there goes Bill!\" then\r\nthe rabbit's voice alone \"catch him, you by the hedge!\" then\r\nsilence, and then another confusion of voices, \"how was it, old\r\nfellow? what happened to you? tell us all about it.\"\r\n\r\nLast came a little feeble squeaking voice, (\"that's Bill\" thought\r\nAlice,) which said \"well, I hardly know--I'm all of a fluster\r\nmyself--something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box, and the\r\nnext minute up I goes like a rocket!\" \"And so you did, old\r\nfellow!\" said the other voices.\r\n\r\n\"We must burn the house down!\" said the voice of the rabbit, and\r\nAlice called out as loud as she could \"if you do, I'll set Dinah\r\nat you!\" This caused silence again, and while Alice was thinking\r\n\"but how can I get Dinah here?\" she found to her great delight\r\nthat she was getting smaller: very soon she was able to get up\r\nout of the uncomfortable position in which she had been lying,\r\nand in two or three minutes more she was once more three inches\r\nhigh.\r\n\r\nShe ran out of the house as quick as she could, and found quite a\r\ncrowd of little animals waiting outside--guinea-pigs, white mice,\r\nsquirrels, and \"Bill\" a little green lizard, that was being\r\nsupported in the arms of one of the guinea-pigs, while another\r\nwas giving it something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at\r\nher the moment she appeared, but Alice ran her hardest, and soon\r\nfound herself in a thick wood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The first thing I've got to do,\" said Alice to herself, as she\r\nwandered about in the wood, \"is to grow to my right size, and the\r\nsecond thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think\r\nthat will be the best plan.\"\r\n\r\nIt sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and\r\nsimply arranged: the only difficulty was, that she had not the\r\nsmallest idea how to set about it, and while she was peering\r\nanxiously among the trees round her, a little sharp bark just\r\nover her head made her look up in a great hurry.\r\n\r\nAn enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes,\r\nand feebly stretching out one paw, trying to reach her: \"poor\r\nthing!\" said Alice in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to\r\nwhistle to it, but she was terribly alarmed all the while at the\r\nthought that it might be hungry, in which case it would probably\r\ndevour her in spite of all her coaxing. Hardly knowing what she\r\ndid, she picked up a little bit of stick, and held it out to the\r\npuppy: whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at\r\nonce, and with a yelp of delight rushed at the stick, and made\r\nbelieve to worry it then Alice dodged behind a great thistle to\r\nkeep herself from being run over, and, the moment she appeared at\r\nthe other side, the puppy made another dart at the stick, and\r\ntumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold: then Alice,\r\nthinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart-horse,\r\nand expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round\r\nthe thistle again: then the puppy begin a series of short charges\r\nat the stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a\r\nlong way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it\r\nsat down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of\r\nits mouth, and its great eyes half shut.\r\n\r\nThis seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape.\r\nShe set off at once, and ran till the puppy's bark sounded quite\r\nfaint in the distance, and till she was quite tired and out of\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\n\"And yet what a dear little puppy it was!\" said Alice, as she\r\nleant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself\r\nwith her hat. \"I should have liked teaching it tricks, if--if I'd\r\nonly been the right size to do it! Oh! I'd nearly forgotten that\r\nI've got to grow up again! Let me see; how _is_ it to be managed?\r\nI suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other, but the\r\ngreat question is what?\"\r\n\r\nThe great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round\r\nher at the flowers and the blades of grass but could not see\r\nanything that looked like the right thing to eat under the\r\ncircumstances. There was a large mushroom near her, about the\r\nsame height as herself, and when she had looked under it, and on\r\nboth sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her to look and\r\nsee what was on the top of it.\r\n\r\nShe stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of\r\nthe mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue\r\ncaterpillar, which was sitting with its arms folded, quietly\r\nsmoking a long hookah, and taking not the least notice of her or\r\nof anything else.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFor some time they looked at each other in silence: at last the\r\ncaterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and languidly\r\naddressed her.\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\" said the caterpillar.\r\n\r\nThis was not an encouraging opening for a conversation: Alice\r\nreplied rather shyly, \"I--I hardly know, sir, just at present--at\r\nleast I know who I was when I got up this morning, but I think I\r\nmust have been changed several times since that.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by that?\" said the caterpillar, \"explain\r\nyourself!\"\r\n\r\n\"I ca'n't explain myself, I'm afraid, sir,\" said Alice, \"because\r\nI'm not myself, you see.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see,\" said the caterpillar.\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly,\" Alice replied very\r\npolitely, \"for I ca'n't understand it myself, and really to be so\r\nmany different sizes in one day is very confusing.\"\r\n\r\n\"It isn't,\" said the caterpillar.\r\n\r\n\"Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet,\" said Alice, \"but\r\nwhen you have to turn into a chrysalis, you know, and then after\r\nthat into a butterfly, I should think it'll feel a little queer,\r\ndon't you think so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit,\" said the caterpillar.\r\n\r\n\"All I know is,\" said Alice, \"it would feel queer to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"You!\" said the caterpillar contemptuously, \"who are you?\"\r\n\r\nWhich brought them back again to the beginning of the\r\nconversation: Alice felt a little irritated at the caterpillar\r\nmaking such very short remarks, and she drew herself up and said\r\nvery gravely \"I think you ought to tell me who you are, first.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" said the caterpillar.\r\n\r\nHere was another puzzling question: and as Alice had no reason\r\nready, and the caterpillar seemed to be in a very bad temper, she\r\nturned round and walked away.\r\n\r\n\"Come back!\" the caterpillar called after her, \"I've something\r\nimportant to say!\"\r\n\r\nThis sounded promising: Alice turned and came back again.\r\n\r\n\"Keep your temper,\" said the caterpillar.\r\n\r\n\"Is that all?\" said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as\r\nshe could.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said the caterpillar.\r\n\r\nAlice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to\r\ndo, and perhaps after all the caterpillar might tell her\r\nsomething worth hearing. For some minutes it puffed away at its\r\nhookah without speaking, but at last it unfolded its arms, took\r\nthe hookah out of its mouth again, and said \"so you think you're\r\nchanged, do you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Alice, \"I ca'n't remember the things I used to\r\nknow--I've tried to say \"How doth the little busy bee\" and it\r\ncame all different!\"\r\n\r\n\"Try and repeat \"You are old, father William\",\" said the\r\ncaterpillar.\r\n\r\nAlice folded her hands, and began:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n1.\r\n\r\n    \"You are old, father William,\" the young man said,\r\n        \"And your hair is exceedingly white:\r\n    And yet you incessantly stand on your head--\r\n        Do you think, at your age, it is right?\"\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\n    \"In my youth,\" father William replied to his son,\r\n        \"I feared it might injure the brain\r\n    But now that I'm perfectly sure I have none,\r\n        Why, I do it again and again.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n3.\r\n\r\n    \"You are old,\" said the youth, \"as I mentioned before,\r\n        And have grown most uncommonly fat:\r\n    Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door--\r\n        Pray what is the reason of that?\"\r\n\r\n4.\r\n\r\n    \"In my youth,\" said the sage, as he shook his gray locks,\r\n        \"I kept all my limbs very supple,\r\n    By the use of this ointment, five shillings the box--\r\n        Allow me to sell you a couple.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n5.\r\n\r\n    \"You are old,\" said the youth, \"and your jaws are too weak\r\n        For anything tougher than suet:\r\n    Yet you eat all the goose, with the bones and the beak--\r\n        Pray, how did you manage to do it?\"\r\n\r\n6.\r\n\r\n    \"In my youth,\" said the old man, \"I took to the law,\r\n        And argued each case with my wife,\r\n    And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,\r\n        Has lasted the rest of my life.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n7.\r\n\r\n    \"You are old,\" said the youth; \"one would hardly suppose\r\n        That your eye was as steady as ever:\r\n    Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose--\r\n        What made you so awfully clever?\"\r\n\r\n8.\r\n\r\n    \"I have answered three questions, and that is enough,\"\r\n        Said his father, \"don't give yourself airs!\r\n    Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?\r\n        Be off, or I'll kick you down stairs!\"\r\n\r\n\"That is not said right,\" said the caterpillar.\r\n\r\n\"Not quite right, I'm afraid,\" said Alice timidly, \"some of the\r\nwords have got altered.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is wrong from beginning to end,\" said the caterpillar\r\ndecidedly, and there was silence for some minutes: the caterpillar\r\nwas the first to speak.\r\n\r\n\"What size do you want to be?\" it asked.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'm not particular as to size,\" Alice hastily replied, \"only\r\none doesn't like changing so often, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you content now?\" said the caterpillar.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I should like to be a little larger, sir, if you wouldn't\r\nmind,\" said Alice, \"three inches is such a wretched height to\r\nbe.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a very good height indeed!\" said the caterpillar loudly\r\nand angrily, rearing itself straight up as it spoke (it was\r\nexactly three inches high).\r\n\r\n\"But I'm not used to it!\" pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone,\r\nand she thought to herself \"I wish the creatures wouldn't be so\r\neasily offended!\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll get used to it in time,\" said the caterpillar, and it put\r\nthe hookah into its mouth, and began smoking again.\r\n\r\nThis time Alice waited quietly until it chose to speak again: in\r\na few minutes the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth,\r\nand got down off the mushroom, and crawled away into the grass,\r\nmerely remarking as it went; \"the top will make you grow taller,\r\nand the stalk will make you grow shorter.\"\r\n\r\n\"The top of what? the stalk of what?\" thought Alice.\r\n\r\n\"Of the mushroom,\" said the caterpillar, just as if she had asked\r\nit aloud, and in another moment was out of sight.\r\n\r\nAlice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute,\r\nand then picked it and carefully broke it in two, taking the\r\nstalk in one hand, and the top in the other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Which does the stalk do?\" she said, and nibbled a little bit of\r\nit to try; the next moment she felt a violent blow on her chin:\r\nit had struck her foot!\r\n\r\nShe was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but as\r\nshe did not shrink any further, and had not dropped the top of\r\nthe mushroom, she did not give up hope yet. There was hardly room\r\nto open her mouth, with her chin pressing against her foot, but\r\nshe did it at last, and managed to bite off a little bit of the\r\ntop of the mushroom.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Come! my head's free at last!\" said Alice in a tone of delight,\r\nwhich changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that\r\nher shoulders were nowhere to be seen: she looked down upon an\r\nimmense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of\r\na sea of green leaves that lay far below her.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"What can all that green stuff be?\" said Alice, \"and where have\r\nmy shoulders got to? And oh! my poor hands! how is it I ca'n't\r\nsee you?\" She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result\r\nseemed to follow, except a little rustling among the leaves. Then\r\nshe tried to bring her head down to her hands, and was delighted\r\nto find that her neck would bend about easily in every direction,\r\nlike a serpent. She had just succeeded in bending it down in a\r\nbeautiful zig-zag, and was going to dive in among the leaves,\r\nwhich she found to be the tops of the trees of the wood she had\r\nbeen wandering in, when a sharp hiss made her draw back: a large\r\npigeon had flown into her face, and was violently beating her\r\nwith its wings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Serpent!\" screamed the pigeon.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not a serpent!\" said Alice indignantly, \"let me alone!\"\r\n\r\n\"I've tried every way!\" the pigeon said desperately, with a kind\r\nof sob: \"nothing seems to suit 'em!\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't the least idea what you mean,\" said Alice.\r\n\r\n\"I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've\r\ntried hedges,\" the pigeon went on without attending to her, \"but\r\nthem serpents! There's no pleasing 'em!\"\r\n\r\nAlice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use\r\nin saying anything till the pigeon had finished.\r\n\r\n\"As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs!\" said the\r\npigeon, \"without being on the look out for serpents, day and\r\nnight! Why, I haven't had a wink of sleep these three weeks!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm very sorry you've been annoyed,\" said Alice, beginning to\r\nsee its meaning.\r\n\r\n\"And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood,\" said the\r\npigeon raising its voice to a shriek, \"and was just thinking I\r\nwas free of 'em at last, they must needs come down from the sky!\r\nUgh! Serpent!\"\r\n\r\n\"But I'm not a serpent,\" said Alice, \"I'm a--I'm a--\"\r\n\r\n\"Well! What are you?\" said the pigeon, \"I see you're trying to\r\ninvent something.\"\r\n\r\n\"I--I'm a little girl,\" said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she\r\nremembered the number of changes she had gone through.\r\n\r\n\"A likely story indeed!\" said the pigeon, \"I've seen a good many\r\nof them in my time, but never one with such a neck as yours! No,\r\nyou're a serpent, I know that well enough! I suppose you'll tell\r\nme next that you never tasted an egg!\"\r\n\r\n\"I have tasted eggs, certainly,\" said Alice, who was a very\r\ntruthful child, \"but indeed I do'n't want any of yours. I do'n't\r\nlike them raw.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, be off, then!\" said the pigeon, and settled down into its\r\nnest again. Alice crouched down among the trees, as well as she\r\ncould, as her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and\r\nseveral times she had to stop and untwist it. Soon she remembered\r\nthe pieces of mushroom which she still held in her hands, and set\r\nto work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the\r\nother, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until\r\nshe had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual size.\r\n\r\nIt was so long since she had been of the right size that it felt\r\nquite strange at first, but she got quite used to it in a minute\r\nor two, and began talking to herself as usual: \"well! there's\r\nhalf my plan done now! How puzzling all these changes are! I'm\r\nnever sure what I'm going to be, from one minute to another!\r\nHowever, I've got to my right size again: the next thing is, to\r\nget into that beautiful garden--how is that to be done, I\r\nwonder?\"\r\n\r\nJust as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a\r\ndoorway leading right into it. \"That's very curious!\" she\r\nthought, \"but everything's curious today: I may as well go in.\"\r\nAnd in she went.\r\n\r\nOnce more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the\r\nlittle glass table: \"now, I'll manage better this time\" she said\r\nto herself, and began by taking the little golden key, and\r\nunlocking the door that led into the garden. Then she set to work\r\neating the pieces of mushroom till she was about fifteen inches\r\nhigh: then she walked down the little passage: and then--she\r\nfound herself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright\r\nflowerbeds and the cool fountains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nA large rose tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the\r\nroses on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it,\r\nbusily painting them red. This Alice thought a very curious\r\nthing, and she went near to watch them, and just as she came up\r\nshe heard one of them say \"look out, Five! Don't go splashing\r\npaint over me like that!\"\r\n\r\n\"I couldn't help it,\" said Five in a sulky tone, \"Seven jogged my\r\nelbow.\"\r\n\r\nOn which Seven lifted up his head and said \"that's right, Five!\r\nAlways lay the blame on others!\"\r\n\r\n\"You'd better not talk!\" said Five, \"I heard the Queen say only\r\nyesterday she thought of having you beheaded!\"\r\n\r\n\"What for?\" said the one who had spoken first.\r\n\r\n\"That's not your business, Two!\" said Seven.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is his business!\" said Five, \"and I'll tell him: it was\r\nfor bringing in tulip-roots to the cook instead of potatoes.\"\r\n\r\nSeven flung down his brush, and had just begun \"well! Of all the\r\nunjust things--\" when his eye fell upon Alice, and he stopped\r\nsuddenly; the others looked round, and all of them took off their\r\nhats and bowed low.\r\n\r\n\"Would you tell me, please,\" said Alice timidly, \"why you are\r\npainting those roses?\"\r\n\r\nFive and Seven looked at Two, but said nothing: Two began, in a\r\nlow voice, \"why, Miss, the fact is, this ought to have been a red\r\nrose tree, and we put a white one in by mistake, and if the Queen\r\nwas to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off. So, you\r\nsee, we're doing our best, before she comes, to--\" At this moment\r\nFive, who had been looking anxiously across the garden called out\r\n\"the Queen! the Queen!\" and the three gardeners instantly threw\r\nthemselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many\r\nfootsteps, and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.\r\n\r\nFirst came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped\r\nlike the three gardeners, flat and oblong, with their hands and\r\nfeet at the corners: next the ten courtiers; these were all\r\nornamented with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers\r\ndid. After these came the Royal children: there were ten of them,\r\nand the little dears came jumping merrily along, hand in hand, in\r\ncouples: they were all ornamented with hearts. Next came the\r\nguests, mostly kings and queens, among whom Alice recognised the\r\nwhite rabbit: it was talking in a hurried nervous manner, smiling\r\nat everything that was said, and went by without noticing her.\r\nThen followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King's crown on a\r\ncushion, and, last of all this grand procession, came THE KING\r\nAND QUEEN OF HEARTS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhen the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and\r\nlooked at her, and the Queen said severely \"who is this?\" She\r\nsaid it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in\r\nreply.\r\n\r\n\"Idiot!\" said the Queen, turning up her nose, and asked Alice\r\n\"what's your name?\"\r\n\r\n\"My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,\" said Alice boldly,\r\nfor she thought to herself \"why, they're only a pack of cards! I\r\nneedn't be afraid of them!\"\r\n\r\n\"Who are these?\" said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners\r\nlying round the rose tree, for, as they were lying on their\r\nfaces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of\r\nthe pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or\r\nsoldiers, or courtiers, or three of her own children.\r\n\r\n\"How should I know?\" said Alice, surprised at her own courage,\r\n\"it's no business of mine.\"\r\n\r\nThe Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for\r\na minute, began in a voice of thunder \"off with her--\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!\" said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen\r\nwas silent.\r\n\r\nThe King laid his hand upon her arm, and said timidly \"remember,\r\nmy dear! She is only a child!\"\r\n\r\nThe Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave\r\n\"turn them over!\"\r\n\r\nThe Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.\r\n\r\n\"Get up!\" said the Queen, in a shrill loud voice, and the three\r\ngardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the\r\nQueen, the Royal children, and everybody else.\r\n\r\n\"Leave off that!\" screamed the Queen, \"you make me giddy.\" And\r\nthen, turning to the rose tree, she went on \"what have you been\r\ndoing here?\"\r\n\r\n\"May it please your Majesty,\" said Two very humbly, going down on\r\none knee as he spoke, \"we were trying--\"\r\n\r\n\"I see!\" said the Queen, who had meantime been examining the\r\nroses, \"off with their heads!\" and the procession moved on, three\r\nof the soldiers remaining behind to execute the three unfortunate\r\ngardeners, who ran to Alice for protection.\r\n\r\n\"You sha'n't be beheaded!\" said Alice, and she put them into her\r\npocket: the three soldiers marched once round her, looking for\r\nthem, and then quietly marched off after the others.\r\n\r\n\"Are their heads off?\" shouted the Queen.\r\n\r\n\"Their heads are gone,\" the soldiers shouted in reply, \"if it\r\nplease your Majesty!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right!\" shouted the Queen, \"can you play croquet?\"\r\n\r\nThe soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question\r\nwas evidently meant for her.\r\n\r\n\"Yes!\" shouted Alice at the top of her voice.\r\n\r\n\"Come on then!\" roared the Queen, and Alice joined the\r\nprocession, wondering very much what would happen next.\r\n\r\n\"It's--it's a very fine day!\" said a timid little voice: she was\r\nwalking by the white rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\"Very,\" said Alice, \"where's the Marchioness?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush, hush!\" said the rabbit in a low voice, \"she'll hear you.\r\nThe Queen's the Marchioness: didn't you know that?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I didn't,\" said Alice, \"what of?\"\r\n\r\n\"Queen of Hearts,\" said the rabbit in a whisper, putting its\r\nmouth close to her ear, \"and Marchioness of Mock Turtles.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are they?\" said Alice, but there was no time for the\r\nanswer, for they had reached the croquet-ground, and the game\r\nbegan instantly.\r\n\r\nAlice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in\r\nall her life: it was all in ridges and furrows: the croquet-balls\r\nwere live hedgehogs, the mallets live ostriches, and the soldiers\r\nhad to double themselves up, and stand on their feet and hands,\r\nto make the arches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe chief difficulty which Alice found at first was to manage her\r\nostrich: she got its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under\r\nher arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she\r\nhad got its neck straightened out nicely, and was going to give a\r\nblow with its head, it would twist itself round, and look up into\r\nher face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help\r\nbursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and\r\nwas going to begin again, it was very confusing to find that the\r\nhedgehog had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling\r\naway: besides all this, there was generally a ridge or a furrow\r\nin her way, wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to, and as\r\nthe doubled-up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to\r\nother parts of the ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion\r\nthat it was a very difficult game indeed.\r\n\r\nThe players all played at once without waiting for turns, and\r\nquarrelled all the while at the tops of their voices, and in a\r\nvery few minutes the Queen was in a furious passion, and went\r\nstamping about and shouting \"off with his head!\" of \"off with her\r\nhead!\" about once in a minute. All those whom she sentenced were\r\ntaken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave\r\noff being arches to do this, so that, by the end of half an hour\r\nor so, there were no arches left, and all the players, except the\r\nKing, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody, and under sentence\r\nof execution.\r\n\r\nThen the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice\r\n\"have you seen the Mock Turtle?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Alice, \"I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come on then,\" said the Queen, \"and it shall tell you its\r\nhistory.\"\r\n\r\nAs they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low\r\nvoice, to the company generally, \"you are all pardoned.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, that's a good thing!\" thought Alice, who had felt quite\r\ngrieved at the number of executions which the Queen had ordered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThey very soon came upon a Gryphon, which lay fast asleep in the\r\nsun: (if you don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture):\r\n\"Up, lazy thing!\" said the Queen, \"and take this young lady to\r\nsee the Mock Turtle, and to hear its history. I must go back and\r\nsee after some executions I ordered,\" and she walked off, leaving\r\nAlice with the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the\r\ncreature, but on the whole she thought it quite as safe to stay\r\nas to go after that savage Queen: so she waited.\r\n\r\nThe Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen\r\ntill she was out of sight: then it chuckled. \"What fun!\" said the\r\nGryphon, half to itself, half to Alice.\r\n\r\n\"What is the fun?\" said Alice.\r\n\r\n\"Why, she,\" said the Gryphon; \"it's all her fancy, that: they\r\nnever executes nobody, you know: come on!\"\r\n\r\n\"Everybody says 'come on!' here,\" thought Alice as she walked\r\nslowly after the Gryphon; \"I never was ordered about so before in\r\nall my life--never!\"\r\n\r\nThey had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the\r\ndistance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and,\r\nas they came nearer, Alice could here it sighing as if its heart\r\nwould break. She pitied it deeply: \"what is its sorrow?\" she\r\nasked the Gryphon, and the Gryphon answered, very nearly in the\r\nsame words as before, \"it's all its fancy, that: it hasn't got no\r\nsorrow, you know: come on!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSo they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large\r\neyes full of tears, but said nothing.\r\n\r\n\"This here young lady\" said the Gryphon, \"wants for to know your\r\nhistory, she do.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell it,\" said the Mock Turtle, in a deep hollow tone, \"sit\r\ndown, and don't speak till I've finished.\"\r\n\r\nSo they sat down, and no one spoke for some minutes: Alice\r\nthought to herself \"I don't see how it can ever finish, if it\r\ndoesn't begin,\" but she waited patiently.\r\n\r\n\"Once,\" said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, \"I was a\r\nreal Turtle.\"\r\n\r\nThese words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by\r\nan occasional exclamation of \"hjckrrh!\" from the Gryphon, and the\r\nconstant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly\r\ngetting up and saying, \"thank you, sir, for your interesting\r\nstory,\" but she could not help thinking there must be more to\r\ncome, so she sat still and said nothing.\r\n\r\n\"When we were little,\" the Mock Turtle went on, more calmly,\r\nthough still sobbing a little now and then, \"we went to school in\r\nthe sea. The master was an old Turtle--we used to call him\r\nTortoise--\"\r\n\r\n\"Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?\" asked Alice.\r\n\r\n\"We called him Tortoise because he taught us,\" said the Mock\r\nTurtle angrily, \"really you are very dull!\"\r\n\r\n\"You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple\r\nquestion,\" added the Gryphon, and then they both sat silent and\r\nlooked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth: at\r\nlast the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, \"get on, old fellow!\r\nDon't be all day!\" and the Mock Turtle went on in these words:\r\n\r\n\"You may not have lived much under the sea--\" (\"I haven't,\" said\r\nAlice,) \"and perhaps you were never even introduced to a\r\nlobster--\" (Alice began to say \"I once tasted--\" but hastily\r\nchecked herself, and said \"no, never,\" instead,) \"so you can have\r\nno idea what a delightful thing a Lobster Quadrille is!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed,\" said Alice, \"what sort of a thing is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" said the Gryphon, \"you form into a line along the sea\r\nshore--\"\r\n\r\n\"Two lines!\" cried the Mock Turtle, \"seals, turtles, salmon, and\r\nso on--advance twice--\"\r\n\r\n\"Each with a lobster as partner!\" cried the Gryphon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" the Mock Turtle said, \"advance twice, set to\r\npartners--\"\r\n\r\n\"Change lobsters, and retire in same order--\" interrupted the\r\nGryphon.\r\n\r\n\"Then, you know,\" continued the Mock Turtle, \"you throw the--\"\r\n\r\n\"The lobsters!\" shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.\r\n\r\n\"As far out to sea as you can--\"\r\n\r\n\"Swim after them!\" screamed the Gryphon.\r\n\r\n\"Turn a somersault in the sea!\" cried the Mock Turtle, capering\r\nwildly about.\r\n\r\n\"Change lobsters again!\" yelled the Gryphon at the top of its\r\nvoice, \"and then--\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all,\" said the Mock Turtle, suddenly dropping its voice,\r\nand the two creatures, who had been jumping about like mad things\r\nall this time, sat down again very sadly and quietly, and looked\r\nat Alice.\r\n\r\n\"It must be a very pretty dance,\" said Alice timidly.\r\n\r\n\"Would you like to see a little of it?\" said the Mock Turtle.\r\n\r\n\"Very much indeed,\" said Alice.\r\n\r\n\"Come, let's try the first figure!\" said the Mock Turtle to the\r\nGryphon, \"we can do it without lobsters, you know. Which shall\r\nsing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! you sing!\" said the Gryphon, \"I've forgotten the words.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSo they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now\r\nand then treading on her toes when they came too close, and\r\nwaving their fore-paws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle\r\nsang, slowly and sadly, these words:\r\n\r\n    \"Beneath the waters of the sea\r\n    Are lobsters thick as thick can be--\r\n    They love to dance with you and me,\r\n      My own, my gentle Salmon!\"\r\n\r\nThe Gryphon joined in singing the chorus, which was:\r\n\r\n    \"Salmon come up! Salmon go down!\r\n    Salmon come twist your tail around!\r\n    Of all the fishes of the sea\r\n      There's none so good as Salmon!\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" said Alice, feeling very glad that the figure was\r\nover.\r\n\r\n\"Shall we try the second figure?\" said the Gryphon, \"or would you\r\nprefer a song?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, a song, please!\" Alice replied, so eagerly, that the Gryphon\r\nsaid, in a rather offended tone, \"hm! no accounting for tastes!\r\nSing her 'Mock Turtle Soup', will you, old fellow!\"\r\n\r\nThe Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes\r\nchoked with sobs, to sing this:\r\n\r\n    \"Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,\r\n    Waiting in a hot tureen!\r\n    Who for such dainties would not stoop?\r\n    Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!\r\n    Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!\r\n        Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!\r\n        Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!\r\n    Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,\r\n        Beautiful beautiful Soup!\r\n\r\n\"Chorus again!\" cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just\r\nbegun to repeat it, when a cry of \"the trial's beginning!\" was\r\nheard in the distance.\r\n\r\n\"Come on!\" cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, he\r\nhurried off, without waiting for the end of the song.\r\n\r\n\"What trial is it?\" panted Alice as she ran, but the Gryphon only\r\nanswered \"come on!\" and ran the faster, and more and more faintly\r\ncame, borne on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n    \"Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,\r\n    Beautiful beautiful Soup!\"\r\n\r\nThe King and Queen were seated on their throne when they arrived,\r\nwith a great crowd assembled around them: the Knave was in\r\ncustody: and before the King stood the white rabbit, with a\r\ntrumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the other.\r\n\r\n\"Herald! read the accusation!\" said the King.\r\n\r\nOn this the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and\r\nthen unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n    \"The Queen of Hearts she made some tarts\r\n      All on a summer day:\r\n    The Knave of Hearts he stole those tarts,\r\n      And took them quite away!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Now for the evidence,\" said the King, \"and then the sentence.\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" said the Queen, \"first the sentence, and then the\r\nevidence!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!\" cried Alice, so loudly that everybody jumped, \"the\r\nidea of having the sentence first!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hold your tongue!\" said the Queen.\r\n\r\n\"I won't!\" said Alice, \"you're nothing but a pack of cards! Who\r\ncares for you?\"\r\n\r\nAt this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down\r\nupon her: she gave a little scream of fright, and tried to beat\r\nthem off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her head in\r\nthe lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some leaves\r\nthat had fluttered down from the trees on to her face.\r\n\r\n\"Wake up! Alice dear!\" said her sister, \"what a nice long sleep\r\nyou've had!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I've had such a curious dream!\" said Alice, and she told her\r\nsister all her Adventures Under Ground, as you have read them,\r\nand when she had finished, her sister kissed her and said \"it was\r\na curious dream, dear, certainly! But now run in to your tea:\r\nit's getting late.\"\r\n\r\nSo Alice ran off, thinking while she ran (as well she might) what\r\na wonderful dream it had been.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut her sister sat there some while longer, watching the setting\r\nsun, and thinking of little Alice and her Adventures, till she\r\ntoo began dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:\r\n\r\nShe saw an ancient city, and a quiet river winding near it along\r\nthe plain, and up the stream went slowly gliding a boat with a\r\nmerry party of children on board--she could hear their voices and\r\nlaughter like music over the water--and among them was another\r\nlittle Alice, who sat listening with bright eager eyes to a tale\r\nthat was being told, and she listened for the words of the tale,\r\nand lo! it was the dream of her own little sister. So the boat\r\nwound slowly along, beneath the bright summer-day, with its merry\r\ncrew and its music of voices and laughter, till it passed round\r\none of the many turnings of the stream, and she saw it no more.\r\n\r\nThen she thought, (in a dream within the dream, as it were,) how\r\nthis same little Alice would, in the after-time, be herself a\r\ngrown woman: and how she would keep, through her riper years, the\r\nsimple and loving heart of her childhood: and how she would\r\ngather around her other little children, and make their eyes\r\nbright and eager with many a wonderful tale, perhaps even with\r\nthese very adventures of the little Alice of long-ago: and how\r\nshe would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure\r\nin all their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the\r\nhappy summer days.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nhappy summer days.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_POSTSCRIPT._\r\n\r\n\r\n_The profits, if any, of this book will be given to Children's\r\nHospitals and Convalescent Homes for Sick Children; and the\r\naccounts, down to June 30 in each year, will be published in the\r\nSt. James's Gazette, on the second Tuesday of the following\r\nDecember._\r\n\r\n_P.P.S.--The thought, so prettily expressed by the little boy, is\r\nalso to be found in Longfellow's \"Hiawatha,\" where he appeals to\r\nthose who believe_\r\n\r\n    \"_That the feeble hands and helpless,_\r\n    _Groping blindly in the darkness_,\r\n    _Touch_ GOD'S _right hand in that darkness_,\r\n    _And are lifted up and strengthened_.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Who will Riddle me the How and the Why?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_So questions one of England's sweetest singers. The \"How?\" has\r\nalready been told, after a fashion, in the verses prefixed to\r\n\"Alice in Wonderland\"; and some other memories of that happy\r\nsummer day are set down, for those who care to see them, in this\r\nlittle book--the germ that was to grow into the published volume.\r\nBut the \"Why?\" cannot, and need not, be put into words. Those for\r\nwhom a child's mind is a sealed book, and who see no divinity in\r\na child's smile, would read such words in vain: while for any one\r\nthat has ever loved one true child, no words are needed. For he\r\nwill have known the awe that falls on one in the presence of a\r\nspirit fresh from_ GOD'S _hands, on whom no shadow of sin, and\r\nbut the outermost fringe of the shadow of sorrow, has yet fallen:\r\nhe will have felt the bitter contrast between the haunting\r\nselfishness that spoils his best deeds and the life that is but\r\nan overflowing love--for I think a child's_ first _attitude to\r\nthe world is a simple love for all living things: and he will\r\nhave learned that the best work a man can do is when he works for\r\nlove's sake only, with no thought of name, or gain, or earthly\r\nreward. No deed of ours, I suppose, on this side the grave, is\r\nreally unselfish: yet if one can put forth all one's powers in a\r\ntask where nothing of reward is hoped for but a little child's\r\nwhispered thanks, and the airy touch of a little child's pure\r\nlips, one seems to come somewhere near to this._\r\n\r\n_There was no idea of publication in my mind when I wrote this\r\nlittle book_: that _was wholly an afterthought, pressed on me by\r\nthe \"perhaps too partial friends\" who always have to bear the\r\nblame when a writer rushes into print: and I can truly say that\r\nno praise of theirs has ever given me one hundredth part of the\r\npleasure it has been to think of the sick children in hospitals\r\n(where it has been a delight to me to send copies) forgetting,\r\nfor a few bright hours, their pain and weariness--perhaps\r\nthinking lovingly of the unknown writer of the tale--perhaps even\r\nputting up a childish prayer (and oh, how much it needs!) for one\r\nwho can but dimly hope to stand, some day, not quite out of sight\r\nof those pure young faces, before the great white throne. \"I am\r\nvery sure,\" writes a lady-visitor at a Home for Sick Children,\r\n\"that there will be many loving earnest prayers for you on Easter\r\nmorning from the children._\"\r\n\r\n_I would like to quote further from her letters, as embodying a\r\nsuggestion that may perhaps thus come to the notice of some one\r\nable and willing to carry it out._\r\n\r\n\"_I want you to send me one of your Easter Greetings for a very\r\ndear child who is dying at our Home. She is just fading away, and\r\n'Alice' has brightened some of the weary hours in her illness,\r\nand I know that letter would be such a delight to her--especially\r\nif you would put 'Minnie' at the top, and she could know you had\r\nsent it for her._ She _knows_ you, _and would so value it.... She\r\nsuffers so much that I long for what I know would so please her.\"\r\n... \"Thank you very much for sending me the letter, and for\r\nwriting Minnie's name.... I am quite sure that all these children\r\nwill say a loving prayer for the 'Alice-man' on Easter Day: and I\r\nam sure the letter will help the little ones to the real Easter\r\njoy. How I do wish that you, who have won the hearts and\r\nconfidence of so many children, would do for them what is so very\r\nnear my heart, and yet what no one will do, viz. write a book for\r\nchildren about_ GOD _and themselves, which is_ not _goody, and\r\nwhich begins at the right end, about religion, to make them see\r\nwhat it really is. I get quite miserable very often over the\r\nchildren I come across: hardly any of them have an idea of_\r\nreally _knowing that_ GOD _loves them, or of loving and confiding\r\nin Him. They will love and trust_ me, _and be sure that I want\r\nthem to be happy, and will not let them suffer more than is\r\nnecessary: but as for going to Him in the same way, they would\r\nnever think of it. They are dreadfully afraid of Him, if they\r\nthink of Him at all, which they generally only do when they have\r\nbeen naughty, and they look on all connected with Him as very\r\ngrave and dull: and, when they are full of fun and thoroughly\r\nhappy, I am sure they unconsciously hope He is not looking. I am\r\nsure I don't wonder they think of Him in this way, for people_\r\nnever _talk of Him in connection with what makes their little\r\nlives the brightest. If they are naughty, people put on solemn\r\nfaces, and say He is very angry or shocked, or something which\r\nfrightens them: and, for the rest, He is talked about only in a\r\nway that makes them think of church and having to be quiet. As\r\nfor being taught that all Joy and all Gladness and Brightness is\r\nHis Joy--that He is wearying for them to be happy, and is not\r\nhard and stern, but always doing things to make their days\r\nbrighter, and caring for them so tenderly, and wanting them to\r\nrun to Him with_ all _their little joys and sorrows, they are\r\nnot taught that. I do so long to make them trust Him as they\r\ntrust us, to feel that He will 'take their part' as they do with\r\nus in their little woes, and to go to Him in their plays and\r\nenjoyments and not only when they say their prayers. I was quite\r\ngrateful to one little dot, a short time ago, who said to his\r\nmother 'when I am in bed, I put out my hand to see if I can feel_\r\nJESUS _and my angel. I thought perhaps_ in the dark _they'd touch\r\nme, but they never have yet.' I do so want them to_ want _to go\r\nto Him, and to feel how, if He is there, it_ must _be happy._\"\r\n\r\n_Let me add--for I feel I have drifted into far too serious a vein\r\nfor a preface to a fairy-tale--the deliciously naïve remark of a\r\nvery dear child-friend, whom I asked, after an acquaintance of two\r\nor three days, if she had read 'Alice' and the 'Looking-Glass.' \"Oh\r\nyes,\" she replied readily, \"I've read both of them! And I think\"\r\n(this more slowly and thoughtfully) \"I think 'Through the\r\nLooking-Glass' is_ more _stupid than 'Alice's Adventures.' Don't_\r\nyou _think so?\" But this was a question I felt it would be hardly\r\ndiscreet for me to enter upon._\r\n\r\n_LEWIS CARROLL._\r\n\r\n_Dec._ 1886.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN EASTER GREETING\r\n\r\nTO\r\n\r\nEVERY CHILD WHO LOVES\r\n\r\n\"Alice.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR CHILD,\r\n\r\n_Please to fancy, if you can, that you are reading a real letter,\r\nfrom a real friend whom you have seen, and whose voice you can\r\nseem to yourself to hear wishing you, as I do now with all my\r\nheart, a happy Easter._\r\n\r\n_Do you know that delicious dreamy feeling when one first wakes\r\non a summer morning, with the twitter of birds in the air, and\r\nthe fresh breeze coming in at the open window--when, lying lazily\r\nwith eyes half shut, one sees as in a dream green boughs waving,\r\nor waters rippling in a golden light? It is a pleasure very near\r\nto sadness, bringing tears to one's eyes like a beautiful picture\r\nor poem. And is not that a Mother's gentle hand that undraws your\r\ncurtains, and a Mother's sweet voice that summons you to rise? To\r\nrise and forget, in the bright sunlight, the ugly dreams that\r\nfrightened you so when all was dark--to rise and enjoy another\r\nhappy day, first kneeling to thank that unseen Friend, who sends\r\nyou the beautiful sun_?\r\n\r\n_Are these strange words from a writer of such tales as \"Alice\"?\r\nAnd is this a strange letter to find in a book of nonsense? It\r\nmay be so. Some perhaps may blame me for thus mixing together\r\nthings grave and gay; others may smile and think it odd that any\r\none should speak of solemn things at all, except in church and on\r\na Sunday: but I think--nay, I am sure--that some children will\r\nread this gently and lovingly, and in the spirit in which I have\r\nwritten it._\r\n\r\n_For I do not believe God means us thus to divide life into two\r\nhalves--to wear a grave face on Sunday, and to think it\r\nout-of-place to even so much as mention Him on a week-day. Do you\r\nthink He cares to see only kneeling figures, and to hear only\r\ntones of prayer--and that He does not also love to see the lambs\r\nleaping in the sunlight, and to hear the merry voices of the\r\nchildren, as they roll among the hay? Surely their innocent\r\nlaughter is as sweet in His ears as the grandest anthem that ever\r\nrolled up from the \"dim religious light\" of some solemn\r\ncathedral?_\r\n\r\n_And if I have written anything to add to those stores of\r\ninnocent and healthy amusement that are laid up in books for the\r\nchildren I love so well, it is surely something I may hope to\r\nlook back upon without shame and sorrow (as how much of life must\r\nthen be recalled!) when_ my _turn comes to walk through the\r\nvalley of shadows._\r\n\r\n_This Easter sun will rise on you, dear child, feeling your \"life\r\nin every limb,\" and eager to rush out into the fresh morning\r\nair_--_and many an Easter-day will come and go, before it finds\r\nyou feeble and gray-headed, creeping wearily out to bask once\r\nmore in the sunlight--but it is good, even now, to think\r\nsometimes of that great morning when the \"Sun of Righteousness\r\nshall arise with healing in his wings.\"_\r\n\r\n_Surely your gladness need not be the less for the thought that\r\nyou will one day see a brighter dawn than this--when lovelier\r\nsights will meet your eyes than any waving trees or rippling\r\nwaters--when angel-hands shall undraw your curtains, and sweeter\r\ntones than ever loving Mother breathed shall wake you to a new\r\nand glorious day--and when all the sadness, and the sin, that\r\ndarkened life on this little earth, shall be forgotten like the\r\ndreams of a night that is past!_\r\n\r\n_Your affectionate friend_,\r\n\r\n_LEWIS CARROLL_.\r\n\r\nEASTER, 1876.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS GREETINGS.\r\n\r\n[FROM A FAIRY TO A CHILD.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    Lady dear, if Fairies may\r\n      For a moment lay aside\r\n    Cunning tricks and elfish play,\r\n      'Tis at happy Christmas-tide.\r\n\r\n    We have heard the children say--\r\n      Gentle children, whom we love--\r\n    Long ago, on Christmas Day,\r\n      Came a message from above.\r\n\r\n    Still, as Christmas-tide comes round,\r\n      They remember it again--\r\n    Echo still the joyful sound\r\n      \"Peace on earth, good-will to men!\"\r\n\r\n    Yet the hearts must childlike be\r\n      Where such heavenly guests abide:\r\n    Unto children, in their glee,\r\n      All the year is Christmas-tide!\r\n\r\n    Thus, forgetting tricks and play\r\n      For a moment, Lady dear,\r\n    We would wish you, if we may,\r\n      Merry Christmas, glad New Year!\r\n\r\nLEWIS CARROLL.\r\n\r\n_Christmas, 1867._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWORKS BY LEWIS CARROLL.\r\n\r\nPUBLISHED BY\r\n\r\nMACMILLAN AND CO., LONDON.\r\n\r\n\r\nALICE'S ADVENTURES _IN_ WONDERLAND.
