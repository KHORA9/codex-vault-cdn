WHEELER AND CO.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDITOR'S PREFACE.\r\n\r\nThe increasing interest attached to all that part of the American\r\nContinent situated within and near the tropics, has suggested the\r\npublication of the present edition of Humboldt's celebrated work,\r\nas a portion of the SCIENTIFIC LIBRARY.\r\n\r\nPrior to the travels of Humboldt and Bonpland, the countries\r\ndescribed in the following narrative were but imperfectly known to\r\nEuropeans. For our partial acquaintance with them we were chiefly\r\nindebted to the early navigators, and to some of the followers of\r\nthe Spanish Conquistadores. The intrepid men whose courage and\r\nenterprise prompted them to explore unknown seas for the discovery\r\nof a New World, have left behind them narratives of their\r\nadventures, and descriptions of the strange lands and people they\r\nvisited, which must ever be perused with curiosity and interest;\r\nand some of the followers of Pizarro and Cortez, as well as many\r\nlearned Spaniards who proceeded to South America soon after the\r\nconquest, were the authors of historical and other works of high\r\nvalue. But these writings of a past age, however curious and\r\ninteresting, are deficient in that spirit of scientific\r\ninvestigation which enhances the importance and utility of accounts\r\nof travels in distant regions. In more recent times, the researches\r\nof La Condamine tended in a most important degree to promote\r\ngeographical knowledge; and he, as well as other eminent botanists\r\nwho visited the coasts of South America, and even ascended the\r\nAndes, contributed by their discoveries and collections to augment\r\nthe vegetable riches of the Old World. But, in their time, geology\r\nas a science had little or no existence. Of the structure of the\r\ngiant mountains of our globe scarcely anything was understood;\r\nwhilst nothing was known beneath the earth in the New World, except\r\nwhat related to her mines of gold and silver.\r\n\r\nIt remained for Humboldt to supply all that was wanting, by the\r\npublication of his Personal Narrative. In this, more than in any\r\nother of his works, he shows his power of contemplating nature in\r\nall her grandeur and variety.\r\n\r\nThe researches and discoveries of Humboldt's able coadjutor and\r\ncompanion, M. Bonpland, afford not only a complete picture of the\r\nbotany of the equinoctial regions of America, but of that of other\r\nplaces visited by the travellers on their voyage thither. The\r\ndescription of the Island of Teneriffe and the geography of its\r\nvegetation, show how much was discovered by Humboldt and Bonpland\r\nwhich had escaped the observation of discerning travellers who had\r\npursued the same route before them. Indeed, the whole account of\r\nthe Canary Islands presents a picture which cannot be contemplated\r\nwithout the deepest interest, even by persons comparatively\r\nindifferent to the study of nature.\r\n\r\nIt is, perhaps, scarcely necessary to remind the reader that since\r\nthe time when this work was first published in Paris, the\r\nseparation of the Spanish Colonies from the mother-country,\r\ntogether with subsequent political events, have wrought great\r\nchanges in the governments of the South American States, as well as\r\nin the social condition of their inhabitants. One consequence of\r\nthese changes has been to render obsolete some facts and\r\nobservations relating to subjects, political, commercial, and\r\nstatistical, interspersed through this work. However useful such\r\nmatter might have been on its original publication, it is wholly\r\nirrelevant to the existing state of things, and consequently it has\r\nbeen deemed advisable to omit it. By this curtailment, together\r\nwith that of some meteorological tables and discussions of very\r\nlimited interest, the work has been divested of its somewhat\r\nlengthy and discursive character, and condensed within dimensions\r\nbetter adapted to the taste and requirements of the present time.\r\n\r\nAn English translation of this work by Helen Maria Williams, was\r\npublished many years ago, and is now out of print. Though faultless\r\nas respects correctness of interpretation, it abounds in foreign\r\nturns of expression, and is somewhat deficient in that fluency of\r\nstyle without which a translated work is unsatisfactory to the\r\nEnglish reader. In the edition now presented to the public it is\r\nhoped that these objections are in some degree removed.\r\n\r\nA careful English version is given of all the Spanish and\r\nPortuguese terms, phrases, and quotations which occur in this work.\r\nThough the author has only in some few instances given a French\r\ntranslation of these passages, yet it is presumed that the\r\ninterpretation of the whole in English will not be deemed\r\nsuperfluous; this new edition of the \"Personal Narrative\" having\r\nbeen undertaken with the view of presenting the work in the form\r\nbest suited for the instruction and entertainment of the general\r\nreader.\r\n\r\nT.R.\r\n\r\nLondon, December 1851.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nMEASURES:\r\n\r\nIn this narrative, as well as in the Political Essay on New Spain,\r\nall the prices are reckoned in piastres, and silver reals (reales\r\nde plata). Eight of these reals are equivalent to a piastre, or one\r\nhundred and five sous, French money (4 shillings 4 1/2 pence\r\nEnglish). Nouv.

Devoted from my earliest youth to\r\nthe study of nature, feeling with enthusiasm the wild beauties of a\r\ncountry guarded by mountains and shaded by ancient forests, I\r\nexperienced in my travels, enjoyments which have amply compensated\r\nfor the privations inseparable from a laborious and often agitated\r\nlife. These enjoyments, which I endeavoured to impart to my readers\r\nin my 'Remarks upon the Steppes,' and in the 'Essay on the\r\nPhysiognomy of Plants,' were not the only fruits I reaped from an\r\nundertaking formed with the design of contributing to the progress\r\nof natural philosophy. I had long prepared myself for the\r\nobservations which were the principal object of my journey to the\r\ntorrid zone. I was provided with instruments of easy and convenient\r\nuse, constructed by the ablest makers, and I enjoyed the special\r\nprotection of a government which, far from presenting obstacles to\r\nmy investigations, constantly honoured me with every mark of regard\r\nand confidence. I was aided by a courageous and enlightened friend,\r\nand it was singularly propitious to the success of our participated\r\nlabour, that the zeal and equanimity of that friend never failed,\r\namidst the fatigues and dangers to which we were sometimes exposed.\r\n\r\nUnder these favourable circumstances, traversing regions which for\r\nages have remained almost unknown to most of the nations of Europe,\r\nI might add even to Spain, M. Bonpland and myself collected a\r\nconsiderable number of materials, the publication of which may\r\nthrow some light on the history of nations, and advance the study\r\nof nature.\r\n\r\nI had in view a two-fold purpose in the travels of which I now\r\npublish the historical narrative. I wished to make known the\r\ncountries I had visited; and to collect such facts as are fitted to\r\nelucidate a science of which we as yet possess scarcely the\r\noutline, and which has been vaguely denominated Natural History of\r\nthe World, Theory of the Earth, or Physical Geography. The last of\r\nthese two objects seemed to me the most important. I was\r\npassionately devoted to botany and certain parts of zoology, and I\r\nflattered myself that our investigations might add some new species\r\nto those already known, both in the animal and vegetable kingdoms;\r\nbut preferring the connection of facts which have been long\r\nobserved, to the knowledge of insulated facts, although new, the\r\ndiscovery of an unknown genus seemed to me far less interesting\r\nthan an observation on the geographical relations of the vegetable\r\nworld, on the migrations of the social plants, and the limit of the\r\nheight which their different tribes attain on the flanks of the\r\nCordilleras.\r\n\r\nThe natural sciences are connected by the same ties which link\r\ntogether all the phenomena of nature. The classification of the\r\nspecies, which must be considered as the fundamental part of\r\nbotany, and the study of which is rendered attractive and easy by\r\nthe introduction of natural methods, is to the geography of plants\r\nwhat descriptive mineralogy is to the indication of the rocks\r\nconstituting the exterior crust of the globe. To comprehend the\r\nlaws observed in the position of these rocks, to determine the age\r\nof their successive formations, and their identity in the most\r\ndistant regions, the geologist should be previously acquainted with\r\nthe simple fossils which compose the mass of mountains, and of\r\nwhich the names and character are the object of oryctognostical\r\nknowledge. It is the same with that part of the natural history of\r\nthe globe which treats of the relations plants have to each other,\r\nto the soil whence they spring, or to the air which they inhale and\r\nmodify. The progress of the geography of plants depends in a great\r\nmeasure on that of descriptive botany; and it would be injurious to\r\nthe advancement of science, to attempt rising to general ideas,\r\nwhilst neglecting the knowledge of particular facts.\r\n\r\nI have been guided by these considerations in the course of my\r\ninquiries; they were always present to my mind during the period of\r\nmy preparatory studies. When I began to read the numerous\r\nnarratives of travels, which compose so interesting a part of\r\nmodern literature, I regretted that travellers, the most\r\nenlightened in the insulated branches of natural history, were\r\nseldom possessed of sufficient variety of knowledge to avail\r\nthemselves of every advantage arising from their position. It\r\nappeared to me, that the importance of the results hitherto\r\nobtained did not keep pace with the immense progress which, at the\r\nend of the eighteenth century, had been made in several departments\r\nof science, particularly geology, the history of the modifications\r\nof the atmosphere, and the physiology of animals and plants. I saw\r\nwith regret, (and all scientific men have shared this feeling) that\r\nwhilst the number of accurate instruments was daily increasing, we\r\nwere still ignorant of the height of many mountains and elevated\r\nplains; of the periodical oscillations of the aerial ocean; of the\r\nlimit of perpetual snow within the polar circle and on the borders\r\nof the torrid zone; of the variable intensity of the magnetic\r\nforces, and of many other phenomena equally important.\r\n\r\nMaritime expeditions and circumnavigatory voyages have conferred\r\njust celebrity on the names of the naturalists and astronomers who\r\nhave been appointed by various governments to share the dangers of\r\nthose undertakings; but though these eminent men have given us\r\nprecise notions of the external configuration of countries, of the\r\nnatural history of the ocean, and of the productions of islands and\r\ncoasts, it must be admitted that maritime expeditions are less\r\nfitted to advance the progress of geology and other parts of\r\nphysical science, than travels into the interior of a continent.\r\nThe advancement of the natural sciences has been subordinate to\r\nthat of geography and nautical astronomy. During a voyage of\r\nseveral years, the land but seldom presents itself to the\r\nobservation of the mariner, and when, after lengthened expectation,\r\nit is descried, he often finds it stripped of its most beautiful\r\nproductions. Sometimes, beyond a barren coast, he perceives a ridge\r\nof mountains covered with verdure, but its distance forbids\r\nexamination, and the view serves only to excite regret.\r\n\r\nJourneys by land are attended with considerable difficulties in the\r\nconveyance of instruments and collections, but these difficulties\r\nare compensated by advantages which it is unnecessary to enumerate.\r\nIt is not by sailing along a coast that we can discover the\r\ndirection of chains of mountains, and their geological\r\nconstitution, the climate of each zone, and its influence on the\r\nforms and habits of organized beings. In proportion to the extent\r\nof continents, the greater on the surface of the soil are the\r\nriches of animal and vegetable productions; the more distant the\r\ncentral chain of mountains from the sea-shore, the greater is the\r\nvariety in the bosom of the earth, of those stony strata, the\r\nregular succession of which unfolds the history of our planet. As\r\nevery being considered apart is impressed with a particular type,\r\nso, in like manner, we find the same distinctive impression in the\r\narrangement of brute matter organized in rocks, and also in the\r\ndistribution and mutual relations of plants and animals. The great\r\nproblem of the physical description of the globe, is the\r\ndetermination of the form of these types, the laws of their\r\nrelations with each other, and the eternal ties which link the\r\nphenomena of life, and those of inanimate nature.\r\n\r\nHaving stated the general object I had in view in my expeditions, I\r\nwill now hasten to give a slight sketch of the whole of the\r\ncollections and observations which we have accumulated, and the\r\nunion of which is the aim and end of every scientific journey. The\r\nmaritime war, during our abode in America, having rendered\r\ncommunication with Europe very uncertain, we found ourselves\r\ncompelled, in order to diminish the chance of losses, to form three\r\ndifferent collections. Of these, the first was embarked for Spain\r\nand France, the second for the United States and England, and the\r\nthird, which was the most considerable, remained almost constantly\r\nunder our own eyes. Towards the close of our expedition, this last\r\ncollection formed forty-two boxes, containing an herbal of six\r\nthousand equinoctial plants, seeds, shells, insects, and (what had\r\nhitherto never been brought to Europe) geological specimens, from\r\nthe Chimborazo, New Grenada, and the banks of the river Amazon.\r\n\r\nAfter our journey to the Orinoco, we left a part of these\r\ncollections at the island of Cuba, intending to take them on our\r\nreturn from Peru to Mexico. The rest followed us during the space\r\nof five years, on the chain of the Andes, across New Spain, from\r\nthe shores of the Pacific to the coasts of the Caribbean Sea. The\r\nconveyance of these objects, and the minute care they required,\r\noccasioned embarrassments scarcely conceiveable even by those who\r\nhave traversed the most uncultivated parts of Europe. Our progress\r\nwas often retarded by the necessity of dragging after us, during\r\nexpeditions of five or six months, twelve, fifteen, and sometimes\r\nmore than twenty loaded mules, exchanging these animals every eight\r\nor ten days, and superintending the Indians who were employed in\r\ndriving the numerous caravan. Often, in order to add to our\r\ncollections of new mineral substances, we found ourselves obliged\r\nto throw away others, which we had collected a considerable time\r\nbefore. These sacrifices were not less vexatious than the losses we\r\naccidentally sustained. Sad experience taught us but too late, that\r\nfrom the sultry humidity of the climate, and the frequent falls of\r\nthe beasts of burden, we could preserve neither the skins of\r\nanimals hastily prepared, nor the fishes and reptiles placed in\r\nphials filled with alcohol. I enter into these details, because,\r\nthough little interesting in themselves, they serve to show that we\r\nhad no means of bringing back, in their natural state, many objects\r\nof zoology and comparative anatomy, of which we have published\r\ndescriptions and drawings. Notwithstanding some obstacles, and the\r\nexpense occasioned by the carriage of these articles, I had reason\r\nto applaud the resolution I had taken before my departure, of\r\nsending to Europe the duplicates only of the productions we\r\ncollected. I cannot too often repeat, that when the seas are\r\ninfested with privateers, a traveller can be sure only of the\r\nobjects in his own possession. A very few of the duplicates, which\r\nwe shipped for Europe during our abode in America, were saved; the\r\ngreater part fell into the hands of persons who feel no interest\r\nfor science. When a ship is condemned in a foreign port, boxes\r\ncontaining only dried plants or stones, instead of being sent to\r\nthe scientific men to whom they are addressed, are put aside and\r\nforgotten. Some of our geological collections taken in the Pacific\r\nwere, however, more fortunate. We were indebted for their\r\npreservation to the generous activity of Sir Joseph Banks,\r\nPresident of the Royal Society of London, who, amidst the political\r\nagitations of Europe, unceasingly laboured to strengthen the bonds\r\nof union between scientific men of all nations.\r\n\r\nIn our investigations we have considered each phenomenon under\r\ndifferent aspects, and classed our remarks according to the\r\nrelations they bear to each other. To afford an idea of the method\r\nwe have followed, I will here add a succinct enumeration of the\r\nmaterials with which we were furnished for describing the volcanoes\r\nof Antisana and Pichincha, as well as that of Jorullo: the latter,\r\nduring the night of the 20th of September, 1759, rose from the\r\nearth one thousand five hundred and seventy-eight French feet above\r\nthe surrounding plains of Mexico. The position of these singular\r\nmountains in longitude and latitude was ascertained by astronomical\r\nobservations. We took the heights of the different parts by the aid\r\nof the barometer, and determined the dip of the needle and the\r\nintensity of the magnetic forces. Our collections contain the\r\nplants which are spread over the flanks of these volcanoes, and\r\nspecimens of different rocks which, superposed one upon another,\r\nconstitute their external coat. We are enabled to indicate, by\r\nmeasures sufficiently exact, the height above the level of the\r\nocean, at which we found each group of plants, and each volcanic\r\nrock. Our journals furnish us with a series of observations on the\r\nhumidity, the temperature, the electricity, and the degree of\r\ntransparency of the air on the brinks of the craters of Pichincha\r\nand Jorullo; they also contain topographical plans and geological\r\nprofiles of these mountains, founded in part on the measure of\r\nvertical bases, and on angles of altitude. Each observation has\r\nbeen calculated according to the tables and the methods which are\r\nconsidered most exact in the present state of our knowledge; and in\r\norder to judge of the degree of confidence which the results may\r\nclaim, we have preserved the whole detail of our partial\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nIt would have been possible to blend these different materials in a\r\nwork devoted wholly to the description of the volcanoes of Peru and\r\nNew Spain. Had I given the physical description of a single\r\nprovince, I could have treated separately everything relating to\r\nits geography, mineralogy, and botany; but how could I interrupt\r\nthe narrative of a journey, a disquisition on the manners of a\r\npeople, or the great phenomena of nature, by an enumeration of the\r\nproductions of the country, the description of new species of\r\nanimals and plants, or the detail of astronomical observations. Had\r\nI adopted a mode of composition which would have included in one\r\nand the same chapter all that has been observed on one particular\r\npoint of the globe, I should have prepared a work of cumbrous\r\nlength, and devoid of that clearness which arises in a great\r\nmeasure from the methodical distribution of matter. Notwithstanding\r\nthe efforts I have made to avoid, in this narrative, the errors I\r\nhad to dread, I feel conscious that I have not always succeeded in\r\nseparating the observations of detail from those general results\r\nwhich interest every enlightened mind. These results comprise in\r\none view the climate and its influence on organized beings, the\r\naspect of the country, varied according to the nature of the soil\r\nand its vegetable covering, the direction of the mountains and\r\nrivers which separate races of men as well as tribes of plants; and\r\nfinally, the modifications observable in the condition of people\r\nliving in different latitudes, and in circumstances more or less\r\nfavourable to the development of their faculties. I do not fear\r\nhaving too much enlarged on objects so worthy of attention: one of\r\nthe noblest characteristics which distinguish modern civilization\r\nfrom that of remoter times is, that it has enlarged the mass of our\r\nconceptions, rendered us more capable of perceiving the connection\r\nbetween the physical and intellectual world, and thrown a more\r\ngeneral interest over objects which heretofore occupied only a few\r\nscientific men, because those objects were contemplated separately,\r\nand from a narrower point of view.\r\n\r\nAs it is probable that these volumes will obtain the attention of a\r\ngreater number of readers than the detail of my observations merely\r\nscientific, or my researches on the population, the commerce, and\r\nthe mines of New Spain, I may be permitted here to enumerate all\r\nthe works which I have hitherto published conjointly with M.\r\nBonpland. When several works are interwoven in some sort with each\r\nother, it may perhaps be interesting to the reader to know the\r\nsources whence he may obtain more circumstantial information.\r\n\r\n1.I.1. ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATIONS, TRIGONOMETRICAL OPERATIONS, AND\r\n  BAROMETRICAL MEASUREMENTS MADE DURING THE COURSE OF A JOURNEY TO\r\n  THE EQUINOCTIAL REGIONS OF THE NEW CONTINENT, FROM 1799 TO 1804.\r\n\r\nThis work, to which are added historical researches on the position\r\nof several points important to navigators, contains, first, the\r\noriginal observations which I made from the twelfth degree of\r\nsouthern to the forty-first degree of northern latitude; the\r\ntransits of the sun and stars over the meridian; distances of the\r\nmoon from the sun and the stars; occultations of the satellites;\r\neclipses of the sun and moon; transits of Mercury over the disc of\r\nthe sun; azimuths; circum-meridian altitudes of the moon, to\r\ndetermine the longitude by the differences of declination;\r\nresearches on the relative intensity of the light of the austral\r\nstars; geodesical measures, etc. Secondly, a treatise on the\r\nastronomical refractions in the torrid zone, considered as the\r\neffect of the decrement of caloric in the strata of the air;\r\nthirdly, the barometric measurement of the Cordillera of the Andes,\r\nof Mexico, of the province of Venezuela, of the kingdom of Quito,\r\nand of New Grenada; followed by geological observations, and\r\ncontaining the indication of four hundred and fifty-three heights,\r\ncalculated according to the method of M. Laplace, and the new\r\nco-efficient of M. Ramond; fourthly, a table of near seven hundred\r\ngeographical positions on the New Continent; two hundred and\r\nthirty-five of which have been determined by my own observations,\r\naccording to the three co-ordinates of longitude, latitude, and\r\nheight.\r\n\r\n1.I.2. EQUINOCTIAL PLANTS COLLECTED IN MEXICO, IN THE ISLAND OF\r\n  CUBA, IN THE PROVINCES OF CARACAS, CUMANA, AND BARCELONA, ON THE\r\n  ANDES OF NEW GRENADA, QUITO, AND PERU, AND ON THE BANKS OF THE RIO\r\n  NEGRO, THE ORINOCO, AND THE RIVER AMAZON.\r\n\r\nM. Bonpland has in this work given figures of more than forty new\r\ngenera of plants of the torrid zone, classed according to their\r\nnatural families. The methodical descriptions of the species are\r\nboth in French and Latin, and are accompanied by observations on\r\nthe medicinal properties of the plants, their use in the arts, and\r\nthe climate of the countries in which they are found.\r\n\r\n1.I.3. MONOGRAPHY OF THE MELASTOMA, RHEXIA, AND OTHER GENERA OF\r\n  THIS ORDER OF PLANTS.\r\n\r\nComprising upwards of a hundred and fifty species of melastomaceae,\r\nwhich we collected during the course of our expeditions, and which\r\nform one of the most beautiful ornaments of tropical vegetation. M.\r\nBonpland has added the plants of the same family, which, among many\r\nother rich stores of natural history, M. Richard collected in his\r\ninteresting expedition to the Antilles and French Guiana, and the\r\ndescriptions of which he has communicated to us.\r\n\r\n1.I.4. ESSAY ON THE GEOGRAPHY OF PLANTS, ACCOMPANIED BY A PHYSICAL\r\n  TABLE OF THE EQUINOCTIAL REGIONS, FOUNDED ON MEASURES TAKEN FROM\r\n  THE TENTH DEGREE OF NORTHERN TO THE TENTH DEGREE OF SOUTHERN\r\n  LATITUDE.\r\n\r\nI have endeavoured to collect in one point of view the whole of the\r\nphysical phenomena of that part of the New Continent comprised\r\nwithin the limits of the torrid zone from the level of the Pacific\r\nto the highest summit of the Andes; namely, the vegetation, the\r\nanimals, the geological relations, the cultivation of the soil, the\r\ntemperature of the air, the limit of perpetual snow, the chemical\r\nconstitution of the atmosphere, its electrical intensity, its\r\nbarometrical pressure, the decrement of gravitation, the intensity\r\nof the azure colour of the sky, the diminution of light during its\r\npassage through the successive strata of the air, the horizontal\r\nrefractions, and the heat of boiling water at different heights.\r\nFourteen scales, disposed side by side with a profile of the Andes,\r\nindicate the modifications to which these phenomena are subject\r\nfrom the influence of the elevation of the soil above the level of\r\nthe sea. Each group of plants is placed at the height which nature\r\nhas assigned to it, and we may follow the prodigious variety of\r\ntheir forms from the region of the palms and arborescent ferns to\r\nthose of the johannesia (chuquiraga, Juss.), the gramineous plants,\r\nand lichens. These regions form the natural divisions of the\r\nvegetable empire; and as perpetual snow is found in each climate at\r\na determinate height, so, in like manner, the febrifuge species of\r\nthe quinquina (cinchona) have their fixed limits, which I have\r\nmarked in the botanical chart belonging to this essay.\r\n\r\n1.I.5. OBSERVATIONS ON ZOOLOGY AND COMPARATIVE ANATOMY.\r\n\r\nI have comprised in this work the history of the condor;\r\nexperiments on the electrical action of the gymnotus; a treatise on\r\nthe larynx of the crocodiles, the quadrumani, and birds of the\r\ntropics; the description of several new species of reptiles,\r\nfishes, birds, monkeys, and other mammalia but little known. M.\r\nCuvier has enriched this work with a very comprehensive treatise on\r\nthe axolotl of the lake of Mexico, and on the genera of the Protei.\r\nThat naturalist has also recognized two new species of mastodons\r\nand an elephant among the fossil bones of quadrupeds which we\r\nbrought from North and South America. For the description of the\r\ninsects collected by M. Bonpland we are indebted to M. Latreille,\r\nwhose labours have so much contributed to the progress of\r\nentomology in our times. The second volume of this work contains\r\nfigures of the Mexican, Peruvian, and Aturian skulls, which we have\r\ndeposited in the Museum of Natural History at Paris, and respecting\r\nwhich Blumenbach has published observations in the 'Decas quinta\r\nCraniorum diversarum gentium.'\r\n\r\n1.I.6. POLITICAL ESSAY ON THE KINGDOM OF NEW SPAIN, WITH A PHYSICAL\r\n  AND GEOGRAPHICAL ATLAS, FOUNDED ON ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATIONS AND\r\n  TRIGONOMETRICAL AND BAROMETRICAL MEASUREMENTS.\r\n\r\nThis work, based on numerous official memoirs, presents, in six\r\ndivisions, considerations on the extent and natural appearance of\r\nMexico, on the population, on the manners of the inhabitants, their\r\nancient civilization, and the political division of their\r\nterritory. It embraces also the agriculture, the mineral riches,\r\nthe manufactures, the commerce, the finances, and the military\r\ndefence of that vast country. In treating these different subjects\r\nI have endeavoured to consider them under a general point of view;\r\nI have drawn a parallel not only between New Spain, the other\r\nSpanish colonies, and the United States of North America, but also\r\nbetween New Spain and the possessions of the English in Asia; I\r\nhave compared the agriculture of the countries situated in the\r\ntorrid zone with that of the temperate climates; and I have\r\nexamined the quantity of colonial produce necessary to Europe in\r\nthe present state of civilization. In tracing the geological\r\ndescription of the richest mining districts in Mexico, I have, in\r\nshort, given a statement of the mineral produce, the population,\r\nthe imports and exports of the whole of Spanish America. I have\r\nexamined several questions which, for want of precise data, had not\r\nhitherto been treated with the attention they demand, such as the\r\ninflux and reflux of metals, their progressive accumulation in\r\nEurope and Asia, and the quantity of gold and silver which, since\r\nthe discovery of America down to our own times, the Old World has\r\nreceived from the New. The geographical introduction at the\r\nbeginning of this work contains the analysis of the materials which\r\nhave been employed in the construction of the Mexican Atlas.\r\n\r\n1.I.7. VIEWS OF THE CORDILLERAS, AND MONUMENTS OF THE INDIGENOUS\r\n  NATIONS OF THE NEW CONTINENT.* (*Atlas Pittoresque, ou Vues des\r\n  Cordilleres, 1 volume folio, with 69 plates, part of which are\r\n  coloured, accompanied by explanatory treatises. This work may be\r\n  considered as the Atlas to the historical narrative of the travels.)\r\n\r\nThis work is intended to represent a few of the grand scenes which\r\nnature presents in the lofty chain of the Andes, and at the same\r\ntime to throw some light on the ancient civilization of the\r\nAmericans, through the study of their monuments of architecture,\r\ntheir hieroglyphics, their religious rites, and their astrological\r\nreveries. I have given in this work a description of the teocalli,\r\nor Mexican pyramids, and have compared their structure with that of\r\nthe temple of Belus. I have described the arabesques which cover\r\nthe ruins of Mitla, the idols in basalt ornamented with the\r\ncalantica of the heads of Isis; and also a considerable number of\r\nsymbolical paintings, representing the serpent-woman (the Mexican\r\nEve), the deluge of Coxcox, and the first migrations of the natives\r\nof the Aztec race. I have endeavoured to prove the striking\r\nanalogies existing between the calendar of the Toltecs and the\r\ncatasterisms of their zodiac, and the division of time of the\r\npeople of Tartary and Thibet, as well as the Mexican traditions on\r\nthe four regenerations of the globe, the pralayas of the Hindoos,\r\nand the four ages of Hesiod. In this work I have also included (in\r\naddition to the hieroglyphical paintings I brought to Europe),\r\nfragments of all the Aztec manuscripts, collected in Rome, Veletri,\r\nVienna, and Dresden, and one of which reminds us, by its lineary\r\nsymbols, of the kouas of the Chinese. Together with the rude\r\nmonuments of the aborigines of America, this volume contains\r\npicturesque views of the mountainous countries which those people\r\ninhabited; for example, the cataract of Tequendama, Chimborazo, the\r\nvolcano of Jorullo and Cayambe, the pyramidal summit of which,\r\ncovered with eternal ice, is situated directly under the\r\nequinoctial line. In every zone the configuration of the ground,\r\nthe physiognomy of the plants, and the aspect of lovely or wild\r\nscenery, have great influence on the progress of the arts, and on\r\nthe style which distinguishes their productions. This influence is\r\nso much the more perceptible in proportion as man is farther\r\nremoved from civilization.\r\n\r\nI could have added to this work researches on the character of\r\nlanguages, which are the most durable monuments of nations. I have\r\ncollected a number of materials on the languages of America, of\r\nwhich MM. Frederic Schlegel and Vater have made use; the former in\r\nhis Considerations on the Hindoos, the latter in his Continuation\r\nof the Mithridates of Adelung, in the Ethnographical Magazine, and\r\nin his Inquiries into the Population of the New Continent. These\r\nmaterials are now in the hands of my brother, William von Humboldt,\r\nwho, during his travels in Spain, and a long abode at Rome, formed\r\nthe richest collection of American vocabularies in existence. His\r\nextensive knowledge of the ancient and modern languages has enabled\r\nhim to trace some curious analogies in relation to this subject, so\r\nimportant to the philosophical study of the history of man. A part\r\nof his labours will find a place in this narrative.\r\n\r\nOf the different works which I have here enumerated, the second and\r\nthird were composed by M. Bonpland, from the observations which he\r\nmade in a botanical journal. This journal contains more than four\r\nthousand methodical descriptions of equinoctial plants, a ninth\r\npart only of which have been made by me. They appear in a separate\r\npublication, under the title of Nova Genera et Species Plantariem.\r\nIn this work will be found, not only the new species we collected,\r\nwhich, after a careful examination by one of the first botanists of\r\nthe age, Professor Willdenouw, are computed to amount to fourteen\r\nor fifteen hundred, but also the interesting observations made by\r\nM. Bonpland on plants hitherto imperfectly described. The plates of\r\nthis work are all engraved according to the method followed by M.\r\nLabillardiere, in the Specimen Planterum Novae Hollandiae, a work\r\nremarkable for profound research and clearness of arrangement.\r\n\r\nAfter having distributed into separate works all that belongs to\r\nastronomy, botany, zoology, the political description of New Spain,\r\nand the history of the ancient civilization of certain nations of\r\nthe New Continent, there still remained many general results and\r\nlocal descriptions, which I might have collected into separate\r\ntreatises. I had, during my journey, prepared papers on the races\r\nof men in South America; on the Missions of the Orinoco; on the\r\nobstacles to the progress of society in the torrid zone arising\r\nfrom the climate and the strength of vegetation; on the character\r\nof the landscape in the Cordilleras of the Andes compared with that\r\nof the Alps in Switzerland; on the analogies between the rocks of\r\nthe two hemispheres; on the physical constitution of the air in the\r\nequinoctial regions, etc. I had left Europe with the firm intention\r\nof not writing what is usually called the historical narrative of a\r\njourney, but to publish the fruit of my inquiries in works merely\r\ndescriptive; and I had arranged the facts, not in the order in\r\nwhich they successively presented themselves, but according to the\r\nrelation they bore to each other. Amidst the overwhelming majesty\r\nof Nature, and the stupendous objects she presents at every step,\r\nthe traveller is little disposed to record in his journal matters\r\nwhich relate only to himself, and the ordinary details of life.\r\n\r\nI composed a very brief itinerary during the course of my\r\nexcursions on the rivers of South America, and in my long journeys\r\nby land. I regularly described (and almost always on the spot) the\r\nvisits I made to the summits of volcanoes, or mountains remarkable\r\nfor their height; but the entries in my journal were interrupted\r\nwhenever I resided in a town, or when other occupations prevented\r\nme from continuing a work which I considered as having only a\r\nsecondary interest. Whenever I wrote in my journal, I had no other\r\nmotive than the preservation of some of those fugitive ideas which\r\npresent themselves to a naturalist, whose life is almost wholly\r\npassed in the open air. I wished to make a temporary collection of\r\nsuch facts as I had not then leisure to class, and note down the\r\nfirst impressions, whether agreeable or painful, which I received\r\nfrom nature or from man. Far from thinking at the time that those\r\npages thus hurriedly written would form the basis of an extensive\r\nwork to be offered to the public, it appeared to me, that my\r\njournal, though it might furnish certain data useful to science,\r\nwould present very few of those incidents, the recital of which\r\nconstitutes the principal charm of an itinerary.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties I have experienced since my return, in the\r\ncomposition of a considerable number of treatises, for the purpose\r\nof making known certain classes of phenomena, insensibly overcame\r\nmy repugnance to write the narrative of my journey. In undertaking\r\nthis task, I have been guided by the advice of many estimable\r\npersons, who honour me with their friendship. I also perceived that\r\nsuch a preference is given to this sort of composition, that\r\nscientific men, after having presented in an isolated form the\r\naccount of their researches on the productions, the manners, and\r\nthe political state of the countries through which they have\r\npassed, imagine that they have not fulfilled their engagements with\r\nthe public, till they have written their itinerary.\r\n\r\nAn historical narrative embraces two very distinct objects; the\r\ngreater or the less important events connected with the purpose of\r\nthe traveller, and the observations he has made during his journey.\r\nThe unity of composition also, which distinguishes good works from\r\nthose on an ill-constructed plan, can be strictly observed only\r\nwhen the traveller describes what has passed under his own eye; and\r\nwhen his principal attention has been fixed less on scientific\r\nobservations than on the manners of different people and the great\r\nphenomena of nature. Now, the most faithful picture of manners is\r\nthat which best displays the relations of men towards each other.\r\nThe character of savage or civilized life is portrayed either in\r\nthe obstacles a traveller meets with, or in the sensations he\r\nfeels. It is the traveller himself whom we continually desire to\r\nsee in contact with the objects which surround him; and his\r\nnarration interests us the more, when a local tint is diffused over\r\nthe description of a country and its inhabitants. Such is the\r\nsource of the interest excited by the history of those early\r\nnavigators, who, impelled by intrepidity rather than by science,\r\nstruggled against the elements in their search for the discovery of\r\na new world. Such is the irresistible charm attached to the fate of\r\nthat enterprising traveller (Mungo Park.), who, full of enthusiasm\r\nand energy, penetrated alone into the centre of Africa, to discover\r\namidst barbarous nations the traces of ancient civilization.\r\n\r\nIn proportion as travels have been undertaken by persons whose\r\nviews have been directed to researches into descriptive natural\r\nhistory, geography, or political economy, itineraries have partly\r\nlost that unity of composition, and that simplicity which\r\ncharacterized those of former ages. It is now become scarcely\r\npossible to connect so many different materials with the detail of\r\nother events; and that part of a traveller's narrative which we may\r\ncall dramatic gives way to dissertations merely descriptive. The\r\nnumerous class of readers who prefer agreeable amusement to solid\r\ninstruction, have not gained by the exchange; and I am afraid that\r\nthe temptation will not be great to follow the course of travellers\r\nwho are incumbered with scientific instruments and collections.\r\n\r\nTo give greater variety to my work, I have often interrupted the\r\nhistorical narrative by descriptions. I first represent phenomena\r\nin the order in which they appeared; and I afterwards consider them\r\nin the whole of their individual relations. This mode has been\r\nsuccessfully followed in the journey of M. de Saussure, whose most\r\nvaluable work has contributed more than any other to the\r\nadvancement of science. Often, amidst dry discussions on\r\nmeteorology, it contains many charming descriptions; such as those\r\nof the modes of life of the inhabitants of the mountains, the\r\ndangers of hunting the chamois, and the sensations felt on the\r\nsummit of the higher Alps.\r\n\r\nThere are details of ordinary life which it may be useful to note\r\nin an itinerary, because they serve for the guidance of those who\r\nafterwards journey through the same countries. I have preserved a\r\nfew, but have suppressed the greater part of those personal\r\nincidents which present no particular interest, and which can be\r\nrendered amusing only by the perfection of style.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the country which has been the object of my\r\ninvestigations, I am fully sensible of the great advantages enjoyed\r\nby persons who travel in Greece, Egypt, the banks of the Euphrates,\r\nand the islands of the Pacific, in comparison with those who\r\ntraverse the continent of America. In the Old World, nations and\r\nthe distinctions of their civilization form the principal points in\r\nthe picture; in the New World, man and his productions almost\r\ndisappear amidst the stupendous display of wild and gigantic\r\nnature. The human race in the New World presents only a few\r\nremnants of indigenous hordes, slightly advanced in civilization;\r\nor it exhibits merely the uniformity of manners and institutions\r\ntransplanted by European colonists to foreign shores. Information\r\nwhich relates to the history of our species, to the various forms\r\nof government, to monuments of art, to places full of great\r\nremembrances, affect us far more than descriptions of those vast\r\nsolitudes which seem destined only for the development of vegetable\r\nlife, and to be the domain of wild animals. The savages of America,\r\nwho have been the objects of so many systematic reveries, and on\r\nwhom M. Volney has lately published some accurate and intelligent\r\nobservations, inspire less interest since celebrated navigators\r\nhave made known to us the inhabitants of the South Sea islands, in\r\nwhose character we find a striking mixture of perversity and\r\nmeekness. The state of half-civilization existing among those\r\nislanders gives a peculiar charm to the description of their\r\nmanners. A king, followed by a numerous suite, presents the fruits\r\nof his orchard; or a funeral is performed amidst the shade of the\r\nlofty forest. Such pictures, no doubt, have more attraction than\r\nthose which pourtray the solemn gravity of the inhabitant of the\r\nbanks of the Missouri or the Maranon.\r\n\r\nAmerica offers an ample field for the labours of the naturalist. On\r\nno other part of the globe is he called upon more powerfully by\r\nnature to raise himself to general ideas on the cause of phenomena\r\nand their mutual connection. To say nothing of that luxuriance of\r\nvegetation, that eternal spring of organic life, those climates\r\nvarying by stages as we climb the flanks of the Cordilleras, and\r\nthose majestic rivers which a celebrated writer (M. Chateaubriand.)\r\nhas described with such graceful accuracy, the resources which the\r\nNew World affords for the study of geology and natural philosophy\r\nin general have been long since acknowledged. Happy the traveller\r\nwho may cherish the hope that he has availed himself of the\r\nadvantages of his position, and that he has added some new facts to\r\nthe mass of those previously acquired!\r\n\r\nSince I left America, one of those great revolutions, which at\r\ncertain periods agitate the human race, has broken out in the\r\nSpanish colonies, and seems to prepare new destinies for a\r\npopulation of fourteen millions of inhabitants, spreading from the\r\nsouthern to the northern hemisphere, from the shores of the Rio de\r\nla Plata and Chile to the remotest part of Mexico. Deep\r\nresentments, excited by colonial legislation, and fostered by\r\nmistrustful policy, have stained with blood regions which had\r\nenjoyed, for the space of nearly three centuries, what I will not\r\ncall happiness but uninterrupted peace. At Quito several of the\r\nmost virtuous and enlightened citizens have perished, victims of\r\ndevotion to their country. While I am giving the description of\r\nregions, the remembrance of which is so dear to me, I continually\r\nlight on places which recall to my mind the loss of a friend.\r\n\r\nWhen we reflect on the great political agitations of the New World,\r\nwe observe that the Spanish Americans are by no means in so\r\nfavourable a position as the inhabitants of the United States; the\r\nlatter having been prepared for independence by the long enjoyment\r\nof constitutional liberty. Internal dissensions are chiefly to be\r\ndreaded in regions where civilization is but slightly rooted, and\r\nwhere, from the influence of climate, forests may soon regain their\r\nempire over cleared lands if their culture be abandoned. It may\r\nalso be feared that, during a long series of years, no foreign\r\ntraveller will be enabled to traverse all the countries which I\r\nhave visited. This circumstance may perhaps add to the interest of\r\na work which pourtrays the state of the greater part of the Spanish\r\ncolonies at the beginning of the 19th century. I even venture to\r\nindulge the hope that this work will be thought worthy of attention\r\nwhen passions shall be hushed into peace, and when, under the\r\ninfluence of a new social order, those countries shall have made\r\nrapid progress in public welfare. If then some pages of my book are\r\nsnatched from oblivion, the inhabitant of the banks of the Orinoco\r\nand the Atabapo will behold with delight populous cities enriched\r\nby commerce, and fertile fields cultivated by the hands of free\r\nmen, on those very spots where, at the time of my travels, I found\r\nonly impenetrable forests and inundated lands.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nPERSONAL NARRATIVE OF A JOURNEY TO THE EQUINOCTIAL REGIONS\r\n  OF THE NEW CONTINENT.\r\n\r\nVOLUME 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.1.\r\nPREPARATIONS.\r\nINSTRUMENTS.\r\nDEPARTURE FROM SPAIN.\r\nLANDING AT THE CANARY ISLANDS.\r\n\r\nFrom my earliest youth I felt an ardent desire to travel into\r\ndistant regions, seldom visited by Europeans. This desire is\r\ncharacteristic of a period of our existence when appears an\r\nunlimited horizon, and when we find an irresistible attraction in\r\nthe impetuous agitations of the mind, and the image of positive\r\ndanger. Though educated in a country which has no direct\r\ncommunication with either the East or the West Indies, living\r\namidst mountains remote from coasts, and celebrated for their\r\nnumerous mines, I felt an increasing passion for the sea and\r\ndistant expeditions. Objects with which we are acquainted only by\r\nthe animated narratives of travellers have a peculiar charm;\r\nimagination wanders with delight over that which is vague and\r\nundefined; and the pleasures we are deprived of seem to possess a\r\nfascinating power, compared with which all we daily feel in the\r\nnarrow circle of sedentary life appears insipid. The taste for\r\nherborisation, the study of geology, rapid excursions to Holland,\r\nEngland, and France, with the celebrated Mr. George Forster, who\r\nhad the happiness to accompany captain Cook in his second\r\nexpedition round the globe, contributed to give a determined\r\ndirection to the plan of travels which I had formed at eighteen\r\nyears of age. No longer deluded by the agitation of a wandering\r\nlife, I was anxious to contemplate nature in all her variety of\r\nwild and stupendous scenery; and the hope of collecting some facts\r\nuseful to the advancement of science, incessantly impelled my\r\nwishes towards the luxuriant regions of the torrid zone. As\r\npersonal circumstances then prevented me from executing the\r\nprojects by which I was so powerfully influenced, I had leisure to\r\nprepare myself during six years for the observations I proposed to\r\nmake on the New Continent, as well as to visit different parts of\r\nEurope, and to explore the lofty chain of the Alps, the structure\r\nof which I might afterwards compare with that of the Andes of Quito\r\nand of Peru.\r\n\r\nI had traversed a part of Italy in 1795, but had not been able to\r\nvisit the volcanic regions of Naples and Sicily; and I regretted\r\nleaving Europe without having seen Vesuvius, Stromboli, and Etna. I\r\nfelt, that in order to form a proper judgment of many geological\r\nphenomena, especially of the nature of the rocks of trap-formation,\r\nit was necessary to examine the phenomena presented by burning\r\nvolcanoes. I determined therefore to return to Italy in the month\r\nof November, 1797. I made a long stay at Vienna, where the fine\r\ncollections of exotic plants, and the friendship of Messrs. de\r\nJacquin, and Joseph van der Schott, were highly useful to my\r\npreparatory studies. I travelled with M. Leopold von Buch, through\r\nseveral cantons of Salzburg and Styria, countries alike interesting\r\nto the landscape-painter and the geologist; but just when I was\r\nabout to cross the Tyrolese Alps, the war then raging in Italy\r\nobliged me to abandon the project of going to Naples.\r\n\r\nA short time before, a gentleman passionately fond of the fine\r\narts, and who had visited the coasts of Greece and Illyria to\r\ninspect their monuments, made me a proposal to accompany him in an\r\nexpedition to Upper Egypt. This expedition was to occupy only eight\r\nmonths. Provided with astronomical instruments and able\r\ndraughtsmen, we were to ascend the Nile as far as Assouan, after\r\nminutely examining the positions of the Said, between Tentyris and\r\nthe cataracts. Though my views had not hitherto been fixed on any\r\nregion but the tropics, I could not resist the temptation of\r\nvisiting countries so celebrated in the annals of human\r\ncivilization. I therefore accepted this proposition, but with the\r\nexpress condition, that on our return to Alexandria I should be at\r\nliberty to continue my journey through Syria and Palestine. The\r\nstudies which I entered upon with a view to this new project, I\r\nafterwards found useful, when I examined the relations between the\r\nbarbarous monuments of Mexico, and those belonging to the nations\r\nof the old world. I thought myself on the point of embarking for\r\nEgypt, when political events forced me to abandon a plan which\r\npromised me so much satisfaction.\r\n\r\nAn expedition of discovery in the South Sea, under the direction of\r\ncaptain Baudin, was then preparing in France. The plan was great,\r\nbold, and worthy of being executed by a more enlightened commander.\r\nThe purpose of this expedition was to visit the Spanish possessions\r\nof South America, from the mouth of the river Plata to the kingdom\r\nof Quito and the isthmus of Panama. After visiting the archipelago\r\nof the Pacific, and exploring the coasts of New Holland, from Van\r\nDiemen's Land to that of Nuyts, both vessels were to stop at\r\nMadagascar, and return by the Cape of Good Hope. I was in Paris\r\nwhen the preparations for this voyage were begun. I had but little\r\nconfidence in the personal character of captain Baudin, who had\r\ngiven cause of discontent to the court of Vienna, when he was\r\ncommissioned to conduct to Brazil one of my friends, the young\r\nbotanist, Van der Schott; but as I could not hope, with my own\r\nresources, to make a voyage of such extent, and view so fine a\r\nportion of the globe, I determined to take the chances of this\r\nexpedition. I obtained permission to embark, with the instruments I\r\nhad collected, in one of the vessels destined for the South Sea,\r\nand I reserved to myself the liberty of leaving captain Baudin\r\nwhenever I thought proper. M. Michaux, who had already visited\r\nPersia and a part of North America, and M. Bonpland, with whom I\r\nthen formed the friendship that still unites us, were appointed to\r\naccompany this expedition as naturalists.\r\n\r\nI had flattered myself during several months with the idea of\r\nsharing the labours directed to so great and honourable an object\r\nwhen the war which broke out in Germany and Italy, determined the\r\nFrench government to withdraw the funds granted for their voyage of\r\ndiscovery, and adjourn it to an indefinite period. Deeply mortified\r\nat finding the plans I had formed during many years of my life\r\noverthrown in a single day, I sought at any risk the speediest\r\nmeans of quitting Europe, and engaging in some enterprise which\r\nmight console me for my disappointment.\r\n\r\nI became acquainted with a Swedish consul, named Skioldebrand, who\r\nhaving been appointed by his court to carry presents to the dey of\r\nAlgiers, was passing through Paris, to embark at Marseilles. This\r\nestimable man had resided a long time on the coast of Africa; and\r\nbeing highly respected by the government of Algiers, he could\r\neasily procure me permission to visit that part of the chain of the\r\nAtlas which had not been the object of the important researches of\r\nM. Desfontaines. He despatched every year a vessel for Tunis, where\r\nthe pilgrims embarked for Mecca, and he promised to convey me by\r\nthe same medium to Egypt. I eagerly seized so favourable an\r\nopportunity, and thought myself on the point of executing a plan\r\nwhich I had formed previously to my arrival in France. No\r\nmineralogist had yet examined that lofty chain of mountains which,\r\nin the empire of Morocco, rises to the limits of the perpetual\r\nsnow. I flattered myself, that, after executing some operations in\r\nthe alpine regions of Barbary, I should receive in Egypt from those\r\nillustrious men who had for some months formed the Institute of\r\nCairo, the same kind attentions with which I had been honoured\r\nduring my abode in Paris. I hastily completed my collection of\r\ninstruments, and purchased works relating to the countries I was\r\ngoing to visit. I parted from a brother who, by his advice and\r\nexample, had hitherto exercised a great influence on the direction\r\nof my thoughts. He approved the motives which determined me to quit\r\nEurope; a secret voice assured us that we should meet again; and\r\nthat hope, which did not prove delusive, assuaged the pain of a\r\nlong separation. I left Paris with the intention of embarking for\r\nAlgiers and Egypt; but by one of those vicissitudes which sway the\r\naffairs of this life, I returned to my brother from the river\r\nAmazon and Peru, without having touched the continent of Africa.\r\n\r\nThe Swedish frigate which was to convey M. Skioldebrand to Algiers,\r\nwas expected at Marseilles toward the end of October. M. Bonpland\r\nand myself repaired thither with great celerity, for during our\r\njourney we were tormented with the fear of being too late, and\r\nmissing our passage.\r\n\r\nM. Skioldebrand was no less impatient than ourselves to reach his\r\nplace of destination. Several times a day we climbed the mountain\r\nof Notre Dame de la Garde, which commands an extensive view of the\r\nMediterranean. Every sail we descried in the horizon excited in us\r\nthe most eager emotion; but after two months of anxiety and vain\r\nexpectation, we learned by the public papers, that the Swedish\r\nfrigate which was to convey us, had suffered greatly in a storm on\r\nthe coast of Portugal, and had been forced to enter the port of\r\nCadiz, to refit. This news was confirmed by private letters,\r\nassuring us that the Jaramas, which was the name of the frigate,\r\nwould not reach Marseilles before the spring.\r\n\r\nWe felt no inclination to prolong our stay in Provence till that\r\nperiod. The country, and especially the climate, were delightful,\r\nbut the aspect of the sea reminded us of the failure of our\r\nprojects. In an excursion we made to Hyeres and Toulon, we found in\r\nthe latter port the frigate la Boudeuse, which had been commanded\r\nby M. de Bougainville, in his voyage round the world. She was then\r\nfitting out for Corsica. M. de Bougainville had honoured me with\r\nparticular kindness during my stay in Paris, when I was preparing\r\nto accompany the expedition of captain Baudin. I cannot describe\r\nthe impression made upon my mind by the sight of the vessel which\r\nhad carried Commerson to the islands of the South Sea. In some\r\nconditions of the mind, a painful emotion blends itself with all\r\nour feelings.\r\n\r\nWe still persisted in the intention of visiting the African coast,\r\nand were nearly becoming the victims of our perseverance. A small\r\nvessel of Ragusa, on the point of setting sail for Tunis, was at\r\nthat time in the port of Marseilles; we thought the opportunity\r\nfavourable for reaching Egypt and Syria, and we agreed with the\r\ncaptain for our passage. The vessel was to sail the following day;\r\nbut a circumstance trivial in itself happily prevented our\r\ndeparture. The live-stock intended to serve us for food during our\r\npassage, was kept in the great cabin. We desired that some changes\r\nshould be made, which were indispensable for the safety of our\r\ninstruments; and during this interval we learnt at Marseilles, that\r\nthe government of Tunis persecuted the French residing in Barbary,\r\nand that every person coming from a French port was thrown into a\r\ndungeon. Having escaped this imminent danger, we were compelled to\r\nsuspend the execution of our projects. We resolved to pass the\r\nwinter in Spain, in hopes of embarking the next spring, either at\r\nCarthagena, or at Cadiz, if the political situation of the East\r\npermitted.\r\n\r\nWe crossed Catalonia and the kingdom of Valencia, on our way to\r\nMadrid. We visited the ruins of Tarragona and those of ancient\r\nSaguntum; and from Barcelona we made an excursion to Montserrat,\r\nthe lofty peaks of which are inhabited by hermits, and where the\r\ncontrast between luxuriant vegetation and masses of naked and arid\r\nrocks, forms a landscape of a peculiar character. I employed myself\r\nin ascertaining by astronomical observations the position of\r\nseveral points important for the geography of Spain, and determined\r\nby means of the barometer the height of the central plain. I\r\nlikewise made several observations on the inclination of the\r\nneedle, and on the intensity of the magnetic forces.\r\n\r\nOn my arrival at Madrid I had reason to congratulate myself on the\r\nresolution I had formed of visiting the Peninsula. Baron de Forell,\r\nminister from the court of Saxony, treated me with a degree of\r\nkindness, of which I soon felt the value. He was well versed in\r\nmineralogy, and was full of zeal for every undertaking that\r\npromoted the progress of knowledge. He observed to me, that under\r\nthe administration of an enlightened minister, Don Mariano Luis de\r\nUrquijo, I might hope to obtain permission to visit, at my own\r\nexpense, the interior of Spanish America. After the disappointments\r\nI had suffered, I did not hesitate a moment to adopt this idea.\r\n\r\nI was presented at the court of Aranjuez in March 1799 and the king\r\nreceived me graciously. I explained to him the motives which led me\r\nto undertake a voyage to the new world and the Philippine Islands,\r\nand I presented a memoir on the subject to the secretary of state.\r\nSenor de Urquijo supported my demand, and overcame every obstacle.\r\nI obtained two passports, one from the first secretary of state,\r\nthe other from the council of the Indies. Never had so extensive a\r\npermission been granted to any traveller, and never had any\r\nforeigner been honoured with more confidence on the part of the\r\nSpanish government.\r\n\r\nMany considerations might have induced us to prolong our abode in\r\nSpain. The abbe Cavanilles, no less remarkable for the variety of\r\nhis attainments than his acute intelligence; M. Nee, who, together\r\nwith M. Haenke, had, as botanist, made part of the expedition of\r\nMalaspina, and who had formed one of the greatest herbals ever seen\r\nin Europe; Don Casimir Ortega, the abbe Pourret, and the learned\r\nauthors of the Flora of Peru, Messrs. Ruiz and Pavon, all opened to\r\nus without reserve their rich collections. We examined part of the\r\nplants of Mexico, discovered by Messrs. Sesse, Mocino, and\r\nCervantes, whose drawings had been sent to the Museum of Natural\r\nHistory of Madrid. This great establishment, the direction of which\r\nwas confided to Senor Clavijo, author of an elegant translation of\r\nthe works of Buffon, offered us, it is true, no geological\r\nrepresentation of the Cordilleras, but M. Proust, so well known by\r\nthe great accuracy of his chemical labours, and a distinguished\r\nmineralogist, M. Hergen, gave us curious details on several mineral\r\nsubstances of America. It would have been useful to us to have\r\nemployed a longer time in studying the productions of the countries\r\nwhich were to be the objects of our research, but our impatience to\r\ntake advantage of the permission given us by the court was too\r\ngreat to suffer us to delay our departure. For a year past, I had\r\nexperienced so many disappointments, that I could scarcely persuade\r\nmyself that my most ardent wishes would be at length fulfilled.\r\n\r\nWe left Madrid about the middle of May, crossed a part of Old\r\nCastile, the kingdoms of Leon and Galicia, and reached Corunna,\r\nwhence we were to embark for Cuba. The winter having been\r\nprotracted and severe, we enjoyed during the journey that mild\r\ntemperature of the spring, which in so southern a latitude usually\r\noccurs during March and April. The snow still covered the lofty\r\ngranitic tops of the Guadarama; but in the deep valleys of Galicia,\r\nwhich resemble the most picturesque spots of Switzerland and the\r\nTyrol, cistuses loaded with flowers; and arborescent heaths clothed\r\nevery rock. We quitted without regret the elevated plain of the two\r\nCastiles, which is everywhere devoid of vegetation, and where the\r\nseverity of the winter's cold is followed by the overwhelming heat\r\nof summer. From the few observations I personally made, the\r\ninterior of Spain forms a vast plain, elevated three hundred toises\r\n(five hundred and eighty-four metres) above the level of the ocean,\r\nis covered with secondary formations, grit-stone, gypsum, sal-gem,\r\nand the calcareous stone of Jura. The climate of the Castiles is\r\nmuch colder than that of Toulon and Genoa; its mean temperature\r\nscarcely rises to 15 degrees of the centigrade thermometer.\r\n\r\nWe are astonished to find that, in the latitude of Calabria,\r\nThessaly, and Asia Minor, orange-trees do not flourish in the open\r\nair. The central elevated plain is encircled by a low and narrow\r\nzone, where the chamaerops, the date-tree, the sugar-cane, the\r\nbanana, and a number of plants common to Spain and the north of\r\nAfrica, vegetate on several spots, without suffering from the\r\nrigours of winter. From the 36th to 40th degrees of latitude, the\r\nmedium temperature of this zone is from 17 to 20 degrees; and by a\r\nconcurrence of circumstances, which it would be too long to\r\nexplain, this favoured region has become the principal seat of\r\nindustry and intellectual improvement.\r\n\r\nWhen, in the kingdom of Valencia, we ascend from the shore of the\r\nMediterranean towards the lofty plains of La Mancha and the\r\nCastiles, we seem to discern, far inland, from the lengthened\r\ndeclivities, the ancient coast of the Peninsula. This curious\r\nphenomenon recalls the traditions of the Samothracians, and other\r\nhistorical testimonies, according to which it is supposed that the\r\nirruption of the waters through the Dardanelles, augmenting the\r\nbasin of the Mediterranean, rent and overflowed the southern part\r\nof Europe. If we admit that these traditions owe their origin, not\r\nto mere geological reveries, but to the remembrance of some ancient\r\ncatastrophe, we may conceive the central elevated plain of Spain\r\nresisting the efforts of these great inundations, till the draining\r\nof the waters, by the straits formed between the pillars of\r\nHercules, brought the Mediterranean progressively to its present\r\nlevel, lower Egypt emerging above its surface on the one side, and\r\nthe fertile plains of Tarragona, Valencia, and Murcia, on the\r\nother. Everything that relates to the formation of that sea,* (*\r\nSome of the ancient geographers believed that the Mediterranean,\r\nswelled by the waters of the Euxine, the Palus Maeotis, the Caspian\r\nSea, and the Sea of Aral, had broken the pillars of Hercules;\r\nothers admitted that the irruption was made by the waters of the\r\nocean. In the first of these hypotheses, the height of the land\r\nbetween the Black Sea and the Baltic, and between the ports of\r\nCette and Bordeaux, determine the limit which the accumulation of\r\nthe waters may have reached before the junction of the Black Sea,\r\nthe Mediterranean, and the Atlantic, as well to the north of the\r\nDardanelles, as to the east of this strip of land which formerly\r\njoined Europe to Mauritania, and of which, in the time of Strabo,\r\ncertain vestiges remained in the Islands of Juno and the Moon.)\r\nwhich has had so powerful an influence on the first civilization of\r\nmankind, is highly interesting. We might suppose, that Spain,\r\nforming a promontory amidst the waves, was indebted for its\r\npreservation to the height of its land; but in order to give weight\r\nto these theoretic ideas, we must clear up the doubts that have\r\narisen respecting the rupture of so many transverse dikes;--we must\r\ndiscuss the probability of the Mediterranean having been formerly\r\ndivided into several separate basins, of which Sicily and the\r\nisland of Candia appear to mark the ancient limits. We will not\r\nhere risk the solution of these problems, but will satisfy\r\nourselves in fixing attention on the striking contrast in the\r\nconfiguration of the land in the eastern and western extremities of\r\nEurope. Between the Baltic and the Black Sea, the ground is at\r\npresent scarcely fifty toises above the level of the ocean, while\r\nthe plain of La Mancha, if placed between the sources of the Niemen\r\nand the Borysthenes, would figure as a group of mountains of\r\nconsiderable height. If the causes, which may have changed the\r\nsurface of our planet, be an interesting speculation,\r\ninvestigations of the phenomena, such as they offer themselves to\r\nthe measures and observations of the naturalist, lead to far\r\ngreater certainty.\r\n\r\nFrom Astorga to Corunna, especially from Lugo, the mountains rise\r\ngradually. The secondary formations gently disappear, and are\r\nsucceeded by the transition rocks, which indicate the proximity of\r\nprimitive strata. We found considerable mountains composed of that\r\nancient grey stone which the mineralogists of the school of\r\nFreyberg name grauwakke, and grauwakkenschiefer. I do not know\r\nwhether this formation, which is not frequent in the south of\r\nEurope, has hitherto been discovered in other parts of Spain.\r\nAngular fragments of Lydian stone, scattered along the valleys,\r\nseemed to indicate that the transition schist is the basis of the\r\nstrata of greywacke. Near Corunna even granitic ridges stretch as\r\nfar as Cape Ortegal. These granites, which seem formerly to have\r\nbeen contiguous to those of Britanny and Cornwall, are perhaps the\r\nwrecks of a chain of mountains destroyed and sunk in the waves.\r\nLarge and beautiful crystals of feldspar characterise this rock.\r\nCommon tin ore is sometimes discovered there, but working the mines\r\nis a laborious and unprofitable operation for the inhabitants of\r\nGalicia.\r\n\r\nThe first secretary of state had recommended us very particularly\r\nto brigadier Don Raphael Clavijo, who was employed in forming new\r\ndock-yards at Corunna. He advised us to embark on board the sloop\r\nPizarro,* (* According to the Spanish nomenclature, the Pizarro was\r\na light frigate (fragata lijera).) which was to sail in company\r\nwith the Alcudia, the packet-boat of the month of May, which, on\r\naccount of the blockade, had been detained three weeks in the port.\r\nSenor Clavijo ordered the necessary arrangements to be made on\r\nboard the sloop for placing our instruments, and the captain of the\r\nPizarro received orders to stop at Teneriffe, as long as we should\r\njudge necessary to enable us to visit the port of Orotava, and\r\nascend the peak.\r\n\r\nWe had yet ten days to wait before we embarked. During this\r\ninterval, we employed ourselves in preparing the plants we had\r\ncollected in the beautiful valleys of Galicia, which no naturalist\r\nhad yet visited: we examined the fuci and the mollusca which the\r\nnorth-west winds had cast with great profusion at the foot of the\r\nsteep rock, on which the lighthouse of the Tower of Hercules is\r\nbuilt. This edifice, called also the Iron Tower, was repaired in\r\n1788. It is ninety-two feet high, its walls are four feet and a\r\nhalf thick, and its construction clearly proves that it was built\r\nby the Romans. An inscription discovered near its foundation, a\r\ncopy of which M. Laborde obligingly gave me, informs us, that this\r\npharos was constructed by Caius Sevius Lupus, architect of the city\r\nof Aqua Flavia (Chaves), and that it was dedicated to Mars. Why is\r\nthe Iron Tower called in the country by the name of Hercules? Was\r\nit built by the Romans on the ruins of a Greek or Phoenician\r\nedifice? Strabo, indeed, affirms that Galicia, the country of the\r\nCallaeci, had been peopled by Greek colonies. According to an\r\nextract from the geography of Spain, by Asclepiades the Myrlaean,\r\nan ancient tradition stated that the companions of Hercules had\r\nsettled in these countries.\r\n\r\nThe ports of Ferrol and Corunna both communicate with one bay, so\r\nthat a vessel driven by bad weather towards the coast may anchor in\r\neither, according to the wind. This advantage is invaluable where\r\nthe sea is almost always tempestuous, as between capes Ortegal and\r\nFinisterre, which are the promontories Trileucum and Artabrum of\r\nancient geography. A narrow passage, flanked by perpendicular rocks\r\nof granite, leads to the extensive basin of Ferrol. No port in\r\nEurope has so extraordinary an anchorage, from its very inland\r\nposition. The narrow and tortuous passage by which vessels enter\r\nthis port, has been opened, either by the irruption of the waves,\r\nor by the reiterated shocks of very violent earthquakes. In the New\r\nWorld, on the coasts of New Andalusia, the Laguna del Obispo\r\n(Bishop's lake) is formed exactly like the port of Ferrol. The most\r\ncurious geological phenomena are often repeated at immense\r\ndistances on the surface of continents; and naturalists who have\r\nexamined different parts of the globe, are struck with the extreme\r\nresemblance observed in the rents on coasts, in the sinuosities of\r\nthe valleys, in the aspect of the mountains, and in their\r\ndistribution by groups. The accidental concurrence of the same\r\ncauses must have everywhere produced the same effects; and amidst\r\nthe variety of nature, an analogy of structure and form is observed\r\nin the arrangement of inanimate matter, as well as in the internal\r\norganization of plants and of animals.\r\n\r\nCrossing from Corunna to Ferrol, over a shallow, near the White\r\nSignal, in the bay, which according to D'Anville is the Portus\r\nMagnus of the ancients, we made several experiments by means of a\r\nvalved thermometrical sounding lead, on the temperature of the\r\nocean, and on the decrement of caloric in the successive strata of\r\nwater. The thermometer on the bank, and near the surface, was from\r\n12.5 to 13.3 degrees centigrades, while in deep water it constantly\r\nmarked 15 or 15.3 degrees, the air being at 12.8 degrees. The\r\ncelebrated Franklin and Mr. Jonathan Williams* (* Author of a work\r\nentitled \"Thermometrical Navigation,\" published at Philadelphia.)\r\nwere the first to invite the attention of naturalists to the\r\nphenomena of the temperature of the Atlantic over shoals, and in\r\nthat zone of tepid and flowing waters which runs from the gulf of\r\nMexico to the banks of Newfoundland and the northern coasts of\r\nEurope. The observation, that the proximity of a sand-bank is\r\nindicated by a rapid descent of the temperature of the sea at its\r\nsurface, is not only interesting to the naturalist, but may become\r\nalso very important for the safety of navigators. The use of the\r\nthermometer ought certainly not to lead us to neglect the use of\r\nthe lead; but experiments sufficiently prove, that variations of\r\ntemperature, sensible to the most imperfect instruments, indicate\r\ndanger long before the vessel reaches the shoals. In such cases,\r\nthe frigidity of the water may induce the pilot to heave the lead\r\nin places where he thought himself in the most perfect safety. The\r\nwaters which cover the shoals owe in a great measure the diminution\r\nof their temperature to their mixture with the lower strata of\r\nwater, which rise towards the surface on the edge of the banks.\r\n\r\nThe moment of leaving Europe for the first time is attended with a\r\nsolemn feeling. We in vain summon to our minds the frequency of the\r\ncommunication between the two worlds; we in vain reflect on the\r\ngreat facility with which, from the improved state of navigation,\r\nwe traverse the Atlantic, which compared to the Pacific is but a\r\nlarger arm of the sea; the sentiment we feel when we first\r\nundertake so distant a voyage is not the less accompanied by a deep\r\nemotion, unlike any other impression we have hitherto felt.\r\nSeparated from the objects of our dearest affections, entering in\r\nsome sort on a new state of existence, we are forced to fall back\r\non our own thoughts, and we feel within ourselves a dreariness we\r\nhave never known before. Among the letters which, at the time of\r\nour embarking, I wrote to friends in France and Germany, one had a\r\nconsiderable influence on the direction of our travels, and on our\r\nsucceeding operations. When I left Paris with the intention of\r\nvisiting the coast of Africa, the expedition for discoveries in the\r\nPacific seemed to be adjourned for several years. I had agreed with\r\ncaptain Baudin, that if, contrary to his expectation, his voyage\r\ntook place at an earlier period, and intelligence of it should\r\nreach me in time, I would endeavour to return from Algiers to a\r\nport in France or Spain, to join the expedition. I renewed this\r\npromise on leaving Europe, and wrote to M. Baudin, that if the\r\ngovernment persisted in sending him by Cape Horn, I would endeavour\r\nto meet him either at Monte Video, Chile, or Lima, or wherever he\r\nshould touch in the Spanish colonies. In consequence of this\r\nengagement, I changed the plan of my journey, on reading in the\r\nAmerican papers, in 1801, that the French expedition had sailed\r\nfrom Havre, to circumnavigate the globe from east to west. I hired\r\na small vessel from Batabano, in the island of Cuba, to Portobello,\r\nand thence crossed the isthmus to the coast of the Pacific; this\r\nmistake of a journalist led M. Bonpland and myself to travel eight\r\nhundred leagues through a country we had no intention to visit. It\r\nwas only at Quito, that a letter from M. Delambre, perpetual\r\nsecretary of the first class of the Institute, informed us, that\r\ncaptain Baudin went by the Cape of Good Hope, without touching on\r\nthe eastern or western coasts of America.\r\n\r\nWe spent two days at Corunna, after our instruments were embarked.\r\nA thick fog, which covered the horizon, at length indicated the\r\nchange of weather we so anxiously desired. On the 4th of June, in\r\nthe evening, the wind turned to north-east, a point which, on the\r\ncoast of Galicia, is considered very constant during the summer.\r\nThe Pizarro prepared to sail on the 5th, though we had intelligence\r\nthat only a few hours previously an English squadron had been seen\r\nfrom the watch-tower of Sisarga, appearing to stand towards the\r\nmouth of the Tagus. Those who saw our ship weigh anchor asserted\r\nthat we should be captured in three days, and that, forced to\r\nfollow the fate of the vessel, we should be carried to Lisbon. This\r\nprognostic gave us the more uneasiness, as we had known some\r\nMexicans at Madrid, who, in order to return to Vera Cruz, had\r\nembarked three times at Cadiz, and having been each time taken at\r\nthe entrance of the port, were at length obliged to return to Spain\r\nthrough Portugal.\r\n\r\nThe Pizarro set sail at two in the afternoon. As the long and\r\nnarrow passage by which a ship sails from the port of Corunna opens\r\ntowards the north, and the wind was contrary, we made eight short\r\ntacks, three of which were useless. A fresh tack was made, but very\r\nslowly, and we were for some moments in danger at the foot of fort\r\nSt. Amarro, the current having driven us very near the rock, on\r\nwhich the sea breaks with considerable violence. We remained with\r\nour eyes fixed on the castle of St. Antonio, where the unfortunate\r\nMalaspina was then a captive in a state prison. On the point of\r\nleaving Europe to visit the countries which this illustrious\r\ntraveller had visited with so much advantage, I could have wished\r\nto have fixed my thoughts on some object less affecting.\r\n\r\nAt half-past six we passed the Tower of Hercules, which is the\r\nlighthouse of Corunna, as already mentioned, and where, from a very\r\nremote time, a coal-fire has been kept up for the direction of\r\nvessels. The light of this fire is in no way proportionate to the\r\nnoble construction of so vast an edifice, being so feeble that\r\nships cannot perceive it till they are in danger of striking on the\r\nshore. Towards the close of day the wind increased and the sea ran\r\nhigh. We directed our course to north-west, in order to avoid the\r\nEnglish frigates, which we supposed were cruising off these coasts.\r\nAbout nine we spied the light of a fishing-hut at Sisarga, which\r\nwas the last object we beheld in the west of Europe.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th we were in the latitude of Cape Finisterre. The group of\r\ngranitic rocks, which forms part of this promontory, like that of\r\nTorianes and Monte de Corcubion, bears the name of the Sierra de\r\nTorinona. Cape Finisterre is lower than the neighbouring lands, but\r\nthe Torinona is visible at seventeen leagues' distance, which\r\nproves that the elevation of its highest summit is not less than\r\n300 toises (582 metres). Spanish navigators affirm that on these\r\ncoasts the magnetic variation differs extremely from that observed\r\nat sea. M. Bory, it is true, in the voyage of the sloop Amaranth,\r\nfound in 1751, that the variation of the needle determined at the\r\nCape was four degrees less than could have been conjectured from\r\nthe observations made at the same period along the coasts. In the\r\nsame manner as the granite of Galicia contains tin disseminated in\r\nits mass, that of Cape Finisterre probably contains micaceous iron.\r\nIn the mountains of the Upper Palatinate there are granitic rocks\r\nin which crystals of micaceous iron take the place of common mica.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th, at sunset, we descried from the mast-head an English\r\nconvoy sailing along the coast, and steering towards south-east. In\r\norder to avoid it we altered our course during the night. From this\r\nmoment no light was permitted in the great cabin, to prevent our\r\nbeing seen at a distance. This precaution, which was at the time\r\nprescribed in the regulations of the packet-ships of the Spanish\r\nnavy, was extremely irksome to us during the voyages we made in the\r\ncourse of the five following years. We were constantly obliged to\r\nmake use of dark-lanterns to examine the temperature of the water,\r\nor to read the divisions on the limb of the astronomical\r\ninstruments. In the torrid zone, where twilight lasts but a few\r\nminutes, our operations ceased almost at six in the evening. This\r\nstate of things was so much the more vexatious to me as from the\r\nnature of my constitution I never was subject to sea-sickness, and\r\nfeel an extreme ardour for study during the whole time I am at sea.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of June, in latitude 39 degrees 50 minutes, and\r\nlongitude 16 degrees 10 minutes west of the meridian of the\r\nobservatory of Paris, we began to feel the effects of the great\r\ncurrent which from the Azores flows towards the straits of\r\nGibraltar and the Canary Islands. This current is commonly\r\nattributed to that tendency towards the east, which the straits of\r\nGibraltar give to the waters of the Atlantic Ocean. M. de Fleurieu\r\nobserves that the Mediterranean, losing by evaporation more water\r\nthan the rivers can supply, causes a movement in the neighbouring\r\nocean, and that the influence of the straits is felt at the\r\ndistance of six hundred leagues. Without derogating from the\r\nrespect I entertain for the opinion of that celebrated navigator, I\r\nmay be permitted to consider this important object in a far more\r\ngeneral point of view.\r\n\r\nWhen we cast our eyes over the Atlantic, or that deep valley which\r\ndivides the western coasts of Europe and Africa from the eastern\r\ncoasts of the new world, we distinguish a contrary direction in the\r\nmotion of the waters. Within the tropics, especially from the coast\r\nof Senegal to the Caribbean Sea, the general current, that which\r\nwas earliest known to mariners, flows constantly from east to west.\r\nThis is called the equinoctial current. Its mean rapidity,\r\ncorresponding to different latitudes, is nearly the same in the\r\nAtlantic and in the Pacific, and may be estimated at nine or ten\r\nmiles in twenty-four hours, consequently from 0.59 to 0.65 of a\r\nfoot every second! In those latitudes the waters run towards the\r\nwest with a velocity equal to a fourth of the rapidity of the\r\ngreater part of the larger rivers of Europe. The movement of the\r\nocean in a direction contrary to that of the rotation of the globe,\r\nis probably connected with this last phenomenon only as far as the\r\nrotation converts into trade winds* (* The limits of the trade\r\nwinds were, for the first time, determined by Dampier in 1666.) the\r\npolar winds, which, in the low regions of the atmosphere bring back\r\nthe cold air of the high latitudes toward the equator. To the\r\ngeneral impulsion which these trade-winds give the surface of the\r\nsea, we must attribute the equinoctial current, the force and\r\nrapidity of which are not sensibly modified by the local variations\r\nof the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nIn the channel which the Atlantic has dug between Guiana and\r\nGuinea, on the meridian of 20 or 23 degrees, and from the 8th or\r\n9th to the 2nd or 3rd degrees of northern latitude, where the\r\ntrade-winds are often interrupted by winds blowing from the south\r\nand south-south-west, the equinoctial current is more inconstant in\r\nits direction. Towards the coasts of Africa, vessels are drawn in\r\nthe direction of south-east; whilst towards the Bay of All Saints\r\nand Cape St. Augustin, the coasts of which are dreaded by\r\nnavigators sailing towards the mouth of the Plata, the general\r\nmotion of the waters is masked by a particular current (the effects\r\nof which extend from Cape St. Roche to the Isle of Trinidad)\r\nrunning north-west with a mean velocity of a foot and a half every\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\nThe equinoctial current is felt, though feebly, even beyond the\r\ntropic of Cancer, in the 26th and 28th degrees of latitude. In the\r\nvast basin of the Atlantic, at six or seven hundred leagues from\r\nthe coasts of Africa, vessels from Europe bound to the West Indies,\r\nfind their sailing accelerated before they reach the torrid zone.\r\nMore to the north, in 28 and 35 degrees, between the parallels of\r\nTeneriffe and Ceuta, in 46 and 48 degrees of longitude, no constant\r\nmotion is observed: there, a zone of 140 leagues in breadth\r\nseparates the equinoctial current (the tendency of which is towards\r\nthe west) from that great mass of water which runs eastward, and is\r\ndistinguished for its extraordinary high temperature. To this mass\r\nof waters, known by the name of the Gulf-stream,* (* Sir Francis\r\nDrake observed this extraordinary movement of the waters, but he\r\nwas unacquainted with their high temperature.) the attention of\r\nnaturalists was directed in 1776 by the curious observations of\r\nFranklin and Sir Charles Blagden.\r\n\r\nThe equinoctial current drives the waters of the Atlantic towards\r\nthe coasts inhabited by the Mosquito Indians, and towards the\r\nshores of Honduras. The New Continent, stretching from south to\r\nnorth, forms a sort of dyke to this current. The waters are carried\r\nat first north-west, and passing into the Gulf of Mexico through\r\nthe strait formed by Cape Catoche and Cape St. Antonio, follow the\r\nbendings of the Mexican coast, from Vera Cruz to the mouth of the\r\nRio del Norte, and thence to the mouths of the Mississippi, and the\r\nshoals west of the southern extremity of Florida. Having made this\r\nvast circuit west, north, east, and south, the current takes a new\r\ndirection northward, and throws itself with impetuosity into the\r\nGulf of Florida. At the end of the Gulf of Florida, in the parallel\r\nof Cape Cannaveral, the Gulf-stream, or current of Florida, runs\r\nnorth-east. Its rapidity resembles that of a torrent, and is\r\nsometimes five miles an hour. The pilot may judge, with some\r\ncertainty, of the proximity of his approach to New York,\r\nPhiladelphia, or Charlestown when he reaches the edge of the\r\nstream; for the elevated temperature of the waters, their saltness,\r\nindigo-blue colour, and the shoals of seaweed which cover their\r\nsurface, as well as the heat of the surrounding atmosphere, all\r\nindicate the Gulf-stream. Its rapidity diminishes towards the\r\nnorth, at the same time that its breadth increases and the waters\r\nbecome cool. Between Cayo Biscaino and the bank of Bahama the\r\nbreadth is only 15 leagues, whilst in the latitude of 28 1/2\r\ndegrees, it is 17, and in the parallel of Charlestown, opposite\r\nCape Henlopen, from 40 to 50 leagues. The rapidity of the current\r\nis from three to five miles an hour where the stream is narrowest,\r\nand is only one mile as it advances towards the north. The waters\r\nof the Mexican Gulf; forcibly drawn to north-east, preserve their\r\nwarm temperature to such a point, that in 40 and 41 degrees of\r\nlatitude I found them at 22.5 degrees (18 degrees R.) when, out of\r\nthe current, the heat of the ocean at its surface was scarcely 17.5\r\ndegrees (14 degrees R.). In the parallel of New York and Oporto,\r\nthe temperature of the Gulf-stream is consequently equal to that of\r\nthe seas of the tropics in the 18th degree of latitude, as, for\r\ninstance, in the parallel of Porto Rico and the islands of Cape\r\nVerd.\r\n\r\nTo the east of the port of Boston, and on the meridian of Halifax,\r\nin latitude 41 degrees 25 minutes, and longitude 67 degrees, the\r\ncurrent is near 80 leagues broad. From this point it turns suddenly\r\nto the east, so that its western edge, as it bends, becomes the\r\nwestern limit of the running waters, skirting the extremity of the\r\ngreat bank of Newfoundland, which M. Volney ingeniously calls the\r\nbar of the mouth of this enormous sea-river. The cold waters of\r\nthis bank, which according to my experiments are at a temperature\r\nof 8.7 or 10 degrees (7 or 8 degrees R.) present a striking\r\ncontrast with the waters of the torrid zone, driven northward by\r\nthe Gulf-stream, the temperature of which is from 21 to 22.5\r\ndegrees (17 to 18 degrees R.). in these latitudes, the caloric is\r\ndistributed in a singular manner throughout the ocean; the waters\r\nof the bank are 9.4 degrees colder than the neighbouring sea; and\r\nthis sea is 3 degrees colder than the current. These zones can have\r\nno equilibrium of temperature, having a source of heat, or a cause\r\nof refrigeration, which is peculiar to each, and the influence of\r\nwhich is permanent.\r\n\r\nFrom the bank of Newfoundland, or from the 52nd degree of longitude\r\nto the Azores, the Gulf-stream continues its course to east and\r\neast-south-east. The waters are still acted upon by the impulsion\r\nthey received near a thousand leagues distance, in the straits of\r\nFlorida, between the island of Cuba and the shoals of Tortoise\r\nIsland. This distance is double the length of the course of the\r\nriver Amazon, from Jaen or the straits of Manseriche to Grand Para.\r\nOn the meridian of the islands of Corvo and Flores, the most\r\nwestern of the group of the Azores, the breadth of the current is\r\n160 leagues. When vessels, on their return from South America to\r\nEurope, endeavour to make these two islands to rectify their\r\nlongitude, they are always sensible of the motion of the waters to\r\nsouth-east. At the 33rd degree of latitude the equinoctial current\r\nof the tropics is in the near vicinity of the Gulf-stream. In this\r\npart of the ocean, we may in a single day pass from waters that\r\nflow towards the west, into those which run to the south-east or\r\neast-south-east.\r\n\r\nFrom the Azores, the current of Florida turns towards the straits\r\nof Gibraltar, the isle of Madeira, and the group of the Canary\r\nIslands. The opening of the Pillars of Hercules has no doubt\r\naccelerated the motion of the waters towards the east. We may in\r\nthis point of view assert, that the strait, by which the\r\nMediterranean communicates with the Atlantic, produces its effects\r\nat a great distance; but it is probable also, that, without the\r\nexistence of this strait, vessels sailing to Teneriffe would be\r\ndriven south-east by a cause which we must seek on the coasts of\r\nthe New World. Every motion is the cause of another motion in the\r\nvast basin of the seas as well as in the aerial ocean. Tracing the\r\ncurrents to their most distant sources, and reflecting on their\r\nvariable celerity, sometimes decreasing as between the gulf of\r\nFlorida and the bank of Newfoundland; at other times augmenting, as\r\nin the neighbourhood of the straits of Gibraltar, and near the\r\nCanary Islands, we cannot doubt but the same cause which impels the\r\nwaters to make the circuitous sweep of the gulf of Mexico, agitates\r\nthem also near the island of Madeira.\r\n\r\nOn the south of that island, we may follow the current, in its\r\ndirection south-east and south-south-east towards the coast of\r\nAfrica, between Cape Cantin and Cape Bojador. In those latitudes a\r\nvessel becalmed is running on the coast, while, according to the\r\nuncorrected reckoning, it was supposed to be a good distance out at\r\nsea. Were the motion of the waters caused by the opening at the\r\nstraits of Gibraltar, why, on the south of those straits, should it\r\nnot follow an opposite direction? On the contrary, in the 25th and\r\n26th degrees of latitude, the current flows at first direct south,\r\nand then south-west. Cape Blanc, which, after Cape Verd, is the\r\nmost salient promontory, seems to have an influence on this\r\ndirection, and in this parallel the waters, of which we have\r\nfollowed the course from the coasts of Honduras to those of Africa,\r\nmingle with the great current of the tropics to resume their tour\r\nfrom east to west. Several hundred leagues westward of the Canary\r\nIslands, the motion peculiar to the equinoctial waters is felt in\r\nthe temperate zone from the 28th and 29th degrees of north\r\nlatitude; but on the meridian of the island of Ferro, vessels sail\r\nsouthward as far as the tropic of Cancer, before they find\r\nthemselves, by their reckoning, eastward of their right course.* (*\r\nSee Humboldt's Cosmos volume 1 page 312 Bohn's edition.)\r\n\r\nWe have just seen that between the parallels of 11 and 43 degrees,\r\nthe waters of the Atlantic are driven by the currents in a\r\ncontinual whirlpool. Supposing that a molecule of water returns to\r\nthe same place from which it departed, we can estimate, from our\r\npresent knowledge of the swiftness of currents, that this circuit\r\nof 3800 leagues is not terminated in less than two years and ten\r\nmonths. A boat, which may be supposed to receive no impulsion from\r\nthe winds, would require thirteen months to go from the Canary\r\nIslands to the coast of Caracas, ten months to make the tour of the\r\ngulf of Mexico and reach Tortoise Shoals opposite the port of the\r\nHavannah, while forty or fifty days might be sufficient to carry it\r\nfrom the straits of Florida to the bank of Newfoundland. It would\r\nbe difficult to fix the rapidity of the retrograde current from\r\nthis bank to the shores of Africa; estimating the mean velocity of\r\nthe waters at seven or eight miles in twenty-four hours, we may\r\nallow ten or eleven months for this last distance. Such are the\r\neffects of the slow but regular motion which agitates the waters of\r\nthe Atlantic. Those of the river Amazon take nearly forty-five days\r\nto flow from Tomependa to Grand Para.\r\n\r\nA short time before my arrival at Teneriffe, the sea had left in\r\nthe road of Santa Cruz the trunk of a cedrela odorata covered with\r\nthe bark. This American tree vegetates within the tropics, or in\r\nthe neighbouring regions. It had no doubt been torn up on the coast\r\nof the continent, or of that of Honduras. The nature of the wood,\r\nand the lichens which covered its bark, bore evidence that this\r\ntrunk had not belonged to these submarine forests which ancient\r\nrevolutions of the globe have deposited in the polar regions. If\r\nthe cedrela, instead of having been cast on the strand of\r\nTeneriffe, had been carried farther south, It would probably have\r\nmade the whole tour of the Atlantic, and returned to its native\r\nsoil with the general current of the tropics. This conjecture is\r\nsupported by a fact of more ancient date, recorded in the history\r\nof the Canaries by the abbe Viera. In 1770, a small vessel laden\r\nwith corn, and bound from the island of Lancerota, to Santa Cruz,\r\nin Teneriffe, was driven out to sea, while none of the crew were on\r\nboard. The motion of the waters from east to west, carried it to\r\nAmerica, where it went on shore at La Guayra, near Caracas.\r\n\r\nWhilst the art of navigation was yet in its infancy, the\r\nGulf-stream suggested to the mind of Christopher Columbus certain\r\nindications of the existence of western regions. Two corpses, the\r\nfeatures of which indicated a race of unknown men, were cast ashore\r\non the Azores, towards the end of the 15th century. Nearly at the\r\nsame period, the brother-in-law of Columbus, Peter Correa, governor\r\nof Porto Santo, found on the strand of that island pieces of bamboo\r\nof extraordinary size, brought thither by the western currents. The\r\ndead bodies and the bamboos attracted the attention of the Genoese\r\nnavigator, who conjectured that both came from a continent situate\r\ntowards the west. We now know that in the torrid zone the\r\ntrade-winds and the current of the tropics are in opposition to\r\nevery motion of the waves in the direction of the earth's rotation.\r\nThe productions of the new world cannot reach the old but by the\r\nvery high latitudes, and in following the direction of the current\r\nof Florida. The fruits of several trees of the Antilles are often\r\nwashed ashore on the coasts of the islands of Ferro and Gomera.\r\nBefore the discovery of America, the Canarians considered these\r\nfruits as coming from the enchanted isle of St. Borondon, which\r\naccording to the reveries of pilots, and certain legends, was\r\nsituated towards the west in an unknown part of the ocean, buried,\r\nas was supposed, in eternal mists.\r\n\r\nMy chief view in tracing a sketch of the currents of the Atlantic\r\nis to prove that the motion of the waters towards the south-east,\r\nfrom Cape St. Vincent to the Canary Islands, is the effect of the\r\ngeneral motion to which the surface of the ocean is subjected at\r\nits western extremity. We shall give but a very succinct account of\r\nthe arm of the Gulf-stream, which in the 45th and 50th degrees of\r\nlatitude, near the bank called the Bonnet Flamand, runs from\r\nsouth-west to north-east towards the coasts of Europe. This partial\r\ncurrent becomes very strong at those times when the west winds are\r\nof long continuance: and, like that which flows along the isles of\r\nFerro and Gomera, it deposits every year on the western coasts of\r\nIreland and Norway the fruit of trees which belong to the torrid\r\nzone of America. On the shores of the Hebrides, we collect seeds of\r\nMimosa scandens, of Dolichos urens, of Guilandina bonduc, and\r\nseveral other plants of Jamaica, the isle of Cuba, and of the\r\nneighbouring continent. The current carries thither also barrels of\r\nFrench wine, well preserved, the remains of the cargoes of vessels\r\nwrecked in the West Indian seas. To these examples of the distant\r\nmigration of the vegetable world, others no less striking may be\r\nadded. The wreck of an English vessel, the Tilbury, burnt near\r\nJamaica, was found on the coast of Scotland. On these same coasts\r\nare sometimes found various kinds of tortoises, that inhabit the\r\nwaters of the Antilles. When the western winds are of long\r\nduration, a current is formed in the high latitudes, which runs\r\ndirectly towards east-south-east, from the coasts of Greenland and\r\nLabrador, as far as the north of Scotland. Wallace relates, that\r\ntwice (in 1682 and 1684), American savages of the race of the\r\nEsquimaux, driven out to sea in their leathern canoes, during a\r\nstorm, and left to the guidance of the currents, reached the\r\nOrkneys. This last example is the more worthy of attention, as it\r\nproves at the same time how, at a period when the art of navigation\r\nwas yet in its infancy, the motion of the waters of the ocean may\r\nhave contributed to disseminate the different races of men over the\r\nface of the globe.\r\n\r\nIn reflecting on the causes of the Atlantic currents, we find that\r\nthey are much more numerous than is generally believed; for the\r\nwaters of the sea may be put in motion by an external impulse, by\r\ndifference of heat and saltness, by the periodical melting of the\r\npolar ice, or by the inequality of evaporation, in different\r\nlatitudes. Sometimes several of these causes concur to one and the\r\nsame effect, and sometimes they produce several contrary effects.\r\nWinds that are light, but which, like the trade-winds, are\r\ncontinually acting on the whole of a zone, cause a real movement of\r\ntransition, which we do not observe in the heaviest tempests,\r\nbecause these last are circumscribed within a small space. When, in\r\na great mass of water, the particles at the surface acquire a\r\ndifferent specific gravity, a superficial current is formed, which\r\ntakes its direction towards the point where the water is coldest,\r\nor where it is most saturated with muriate of soda, sulphate of\r\nlime, and muriate or sulphate of magnesia. In the seas of the\r\ntropics we find, that at great depths the thermometer marks 7 or 8\r\ncentesimal degrees. Such is the result of the numerous experiments\r\nof commodore Ellis and of M. Peron. The temperature of the air in\r\nthose latitudes being never below 19 or 20 degrees, it is not at\r\nthe surface that the waters can have acquired a degree of cold so\r\nnear the point of congelation, and of the maximum of the density of\r\nwater. The existence of this cold stratum in the low latitudes is\r\nan evident proof of the existence of an under-current, which runs\r\nfrom the poles towards the equator: it also proves that the saline\r\nsubstances which alter the specific gravity of the water, are\r\ndistributed in the ocean, so as not to annihilate the effect\r\nproduced by the differences of temperature.\r\n\r\nConsidering the velocity of the molecules, which, on account of the\r\nrotatory motion of the globe, vary with the parallels, we may be\r\ntempted to admit that every current, in the direction from south to\r\nnorth, tends at the same time eastward, while the waters which run\r\nfrom the pole towards the equator, have a tendency to deviate\r\nwestward. We may also be led to think that these tendencies\r\ndiminish to a certain point the speed of the tropical current, in\r\nthe same manner as they change the direction of the polar current,\r\nwhich in July and August, is regularly perceived during the melting\r\nof the ice, on the parallel of the bank of Newfoundland, and\r\nfarther north. Very old nautical observations, which I have had\r\noccasion to confirm by comparing the longitude given by the\r\nchronometer with that which the pilots obtained by their reckoning,\r\nare, however, contrary to these theoretical ideas. In both\r\nhemispheres, the polar currents, when they are perceived, decline a\r\nlittle to the east; and it would seem that the cause of this\r\nphenomenon should be sought in the constancy of the westerly winds\r\nwhich prevail in the high latitudes. Besides, the particles of\r\nwater do not move with the same rapidity as the particles of air;\r\nand the currents of the ocean, which we consider as most rapid,\r\nhave only a swiftness of eight or nine feet a second; it is\r\nconsequently very probable, that the water, in passing through\r\ndifferent parallels, gradually acquires a velocity correspondent to\r\nthose parallels, and that the rotation of the earth does not change\r\nthe direction of the currents.\r\n\r\nThe variable pressure on the surface of the sea, caused by the\r\nchanges in the weight of the air, is another cause of motion which\r\ndeserves particular attention. It is well known, that the\r\nbarometric variations do not in general take place at the same\r\nmoment in two distant points, which are on the same level. If in\r\none of these points the barometer stands a few lines lower than in\r\nthe other, the water will rise where it finds the least pressure of\r\nair, and this local intumescence will continue, till, from the\r\neffect of the wind, the equilibrium of the air is restored. M.\r\nVaucher thinks that the tides in the lake of Geneva, known by the\r\nname of the seiches, arise from the same cause. We know not whether\r\nit be the same, when the movement of progression, which must not be\r\nconfounded with the oscillation of the waves, is the effect of an\r\nexternal impulse. M. de Fleurieu, in his narrative of the voyage of\r\nthe Isis, cites several facts, which render it probable that the\r\nsea is not so still at the bottom as naturalists generally suppose.\r\nWithout entering here into a discussion of this question, we shall\r\nonly observe that, if the external impulse is constant in its\r\naction, like that of the trade-winds, the friction of the particles\r\nof water on each other must necessarily propagate the motion of the\r\nsurface of the ocean even to the lower strata; and in fact this\r\npropagation in the Gulf-stream has long been admitted by\r\nnavigators, who think they discover the effects in the great depth\r\nof the sea wherever it is traversed by the current of Florida, even\r\namidst the sand-banks which surround the northern coasts of the\r\nUnited States. This immense river of hot waters, after a course of\r\nfifty days, from the 24th to the 45th degree of latitude, or 450\r\nleagues, does not lose, amidst the rigours of winter in the\r\ntemperate zone, more than 3 or 4 degrees of the temperature it had\r\nunder the tropics. The greatness of the mass, and the small\r\nconductibility of water for heat, prevent a more speedy\r\nrefrigeration. If, therefore, the Gulf-stream has dug a channel at\r\nthe bottom of the Atlantic ocean, and if its waters are in motion\r\nto considerable depths, they must also in their inferior strata\r\nkeep up a lower temperature than that observed in the same\r\nparallel, in a part of the sea which has neither currents nor deep\r\nshoals. These questions can be cleared up only by direct\r\nexperiments, made by thermometrical soundings.\r\n\r\nSir Erasmus Gower remarks, that, in the passage from England to the\r\nCanary islands, the current, which carries vessels towards the\r\nsouth-east, begins at the 39th degree of latitude. During our\r\nvoyage from Corunna to the coast of South America, the effect of\r\nthis motion of the waters was perceived farther north. From the\r\n37th to the 30th degree, the deviation was very unequal; the daily\r\naverage effect was 12 miles, that is, our sloop drove towards the\r\neast 75 miles in six days. In crossing the parallel of the straits\r\nof Gibraltar, at a distance of 140 leagues, we had occasion to\r\nobserve, that in those latitudes the maximum of the rapidity does\r\nnot correspond with the mouth of the straits, but with a more\r\nnortherly point, which lies on the prolongation of a line passing\r\nthrough the strait and Cape St. Vincent. This line is parallel to\r\nthe direction which the waters follow from the Azores to Cape\r\nCantin. We should moreover observe (and this fact is not\r\nuninteresting to those who examine the nature of fluids), that in\r\nthis part of the retrograde current, on a breadth of 120 or 140\r\nleagues, the whole mass of water has not the same rapidity, nor\r\ndoes it follow precisely the same direction. When the sea is\r\nperfectly calm, there appears at the surface narrow stripes, like\r\nsmall rivulets, in which the waters run with a murmur very sensible\r\nto the ear of an experienced pilot. On the 13th of June, in 34\r\ndegrees 36 minutes north latitude, we found ourselves in the midst\r\nof a great number of these beds of currents. We took their\r\ndirection with the compass, and some ran north-east, others\r\neast-north-east, though the general movement of the ocean,\r\nindicated by comparing the reckoning with the chronometrical\r\nlongitude, continued to be south-east. It is very common to see a\r\nmass of motionless waters crossed by threads of water, which run in\r\ndifferent directions, and we may daily observe this phenomenon on\r\nthe surface of lakes; but it is much less frequent to find partial\r\nmovements, impressed by local causes on small portions of waters in\r\nthe midst of an oceanic river, which occupies an immense space, and\r\nwhich moves, though slowly, in a constant direction. In the\r\nconflict of currents, as in the oscillation of the waves, our\r\nimagination is struck by those movements which seem to penetrate\r\neach other, and by which the ocean is continually agitated.\r\n\r\nWe passed Cape St. Vincent, which is of basaltic formation, at the\r\ndistance of more than eighty leagues. It is not distinctly seen at\r\na greater distance than 15 leagues, but the granitic mountain\r\ncalled the Foya de Monchique, situated near the Cape, is\r\nperceptible, as pilots allege, at the distance of 26 leagues. If\r\nthis assertion be exact, the Foya is 700 toises (1363 metres), and\r\nconsequently 116 toises (225 metres) higher than Vesuvius.\r\n\r\nFrom Corunna to the 36th degree of latitude we had scarcely seen\r\nany organic being, excepting sea-swallows and a few dolphins. We\r\nlooked in vain for sea-weeds (fuci) and mollusca, when on the 11th\r\nof June we were struck with a curious sight which afterwards was\r\nfrequently renewed in the southern ocean. We entered on a zone\r\nwhere the whole sea was covered with a prodigious quantity of\r\nmedusas. The vessel was almost becalmed, but the mollusca were\r\nborne towards the south-east, with a rapidity four times greater\r\nthan the current. Their passage lasted near three quarters of an\r\nhour. We then perceived but a few scattered individuals, following\r\nthe crowd at a distance as if tired with their journey. Do these\r\nanimals come from the bottom of the sea, which is perhaps in these\r\nlatitudes some thousand fathoms deep? or do they make distant\r\nvoyages in shoals? We know that the mollusca haunt banks; and if\r\nthe eight rocks, near the surface, which captain Vobonne mentions\r\nhaving seen in 1732, to the north of Porto Santo, really exist, we\r\nmay suppose that this innumerable quantity of medusas had been\r\nthence detached; for we were but 28 leagues from the reef. We\r\nfound, beside the Medusa aurita of Baster, and the Medusa pelagica\r\nof Bosc with eight tentacula (Pelagia denticulata, Peron), a third\r\nspecies which resembles the Medusa hysocella, and which Vandelli\r\nfound at the mouth of the Tagus. It is known by its brownish-yellow\r\ncolour, and by its tentacula, which are longer than the body.\r\nSeveral of these sea-nettles were four inches in diameter: their\r\nreflection was almost metallic: their changeable colours of violet\r\nand purple formed an agreeable contrast with the azure tint of the\r\nocean.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these medusas M. Bonpland observed bundles of\r\nDagysa notata, a mollusc of a singular construction, which Sir\r\nJoseph Banks first discovered. These are small gelatinous bags,\r\ntransparent, cylindrical, sometimes polygonal, thirteen lines long\r\nand two or three in diameter. These bags are open at both ends. In\r\none of these openings, we observed a hyaline bladder, marked with a\r\nyellow spot. The cylinders lie longitudinally, one against another,\r\nlike the cells of a bee-hive, and form chaplets from six to eight\r\ninches in length. I tried the galvanic electricity on these\r\nmollusca, but it produced no contraction. It appears that the genus\r\ndagysa, formed at the time of Cook's first voyage, belongs to the\r\nsalpas (biphores of Bruguiere), to which M. Cuvier joins the Thalia\r\nof Brown, and the Tethys vagina of Tilesius. The salpas journey\r\nalso by groups, joining in chaplets, as we have observed of the\r\ndagysa.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 13th of June, in 34 degrees 33 minutes\r\nlatitude, we saw large masses of this last mollusc in its passage,\r\nthe sea being perfectly calm. We observed during the night, that,\r\nof three species of medusas which we collected, none yielded any\r\nlight but at the moment of a very slight shock. This property does\r\nnot belong exclusively to the Medusa noctiluca, which Forskael has\r\ndescribed in his Fauna Aegyptiaca, and which Gmelin has applied to\r\nthe Medusa pelagica of Loefling, notwithstanding its red tentacula,\r\nand the brownish tuberosities of its body. If we place a very\r\nirritable medusa on a pewter plate, and strike against the plate\r\nwith any sort of metal, the slight vibrations of the plate are\r\nsufficient to make this animal emit light. Sometimes, in\r\ngalvanising the medusa, the phosphorescence appears at the moment\r\nthat the chain closes, though the exciters are not in immediate\r\ncontact with the organs of the animal. The fingers with which we\r\ntouch it remain luminous for two or three minutes, as is observed\r\nin breaking the shell of the pholades. If we rub wood with the body\r\nof a medusa, and the part rubbed ceases shining, the\r\nphosphorescence returns if we pass a dry hand over the wood. When\r\nthe light is extinguished a second time, it can no longer be\r\nreproduced, though the place rubbed be still humid and viscous. In\r\nwhat manner ought we to consider the effect of the friction, or\r\nthat of the shock? This is a question of difficult solution. Is it\r\na slight augmentation of temperature which favours the\r\nphosphorescence? or does the light return, because the surface is\r\nrenewed, by putting the animal parts proper to disengage the\r\nphosphoric hydrogen in contact with the oxygen of the atmospheric\r\nair? I have proved by experiments published in 1797, that the\r\nshining of wood is extinguished in hydrogen gas, and in pure azotic\r\ngas, and that its light reappears whenever we mix with it the\r\nsmallest bubble of oxygen gas. These facts, to which several others\r\nmay be added, tend to explain the causes of the phosphorescence of\r\nthe sea, and of that peculiar influence which the shock of the\r\nwaves exercises on the production of light.\r\n\r\nWhen we were between the island of Madeira and the coast of Africa,\r\nwe had slight breezes and dead calms, very favourable for the\r\nmagnetic observations, which occupied me during this passage. We\r\nwere never weary of admiring the beauty of the nights; nothing can\r\nbe compared to the transparency and serenity of an African sky. We\r\nwere struck with the innumerable quantity of falling stars, which\r\nappeared at every instant. The farther progress we made towards the\r\nsouth, the more frequent was this phenomenon, especially near the\r\nCanaries. I have observed during my travels, that these igneous\r\nmeteors are in general more common and luminous in some regions of\r\nthe globe than in others; but I have never beheld them so\r\nmultiplied as in the vicinity of the volcanoes of the province of\r\nQuito, and in that part of the Pacific ocean which bathes the\r\nvolcanic coasts of Guatimala. The influence which place, climate,\r\nand season appear to exercise on the falling stars, distinguishes\r\nthis class of meteors from those to which we trace stones that drop\r\nfrom the sky (aerolites), and which probably exist beyond the\r\nboundaries of our atmosphere. According to the observations of\r\nMessrs. Benzenberg and Brandes, many of the falling stars seen in\r\nEurope have been only thirty thousand toises high. One was even\r\nmeasured which did not exceed fourteen thousand toises, or five\r\nnautical leagues. These measures, which can give no result but by\r\napproximation, deserve well to be repeated. In warm climates,\r\nespecially within the tropics, falling stars leave a tail behind\r\nthem, which remains luminous 12 or 15 seconds: at other times they\r\nseem to burst into sparks, and they are generally lower than those\r\nin the north of Europe. We perceive them only in a serene and azure\r\nsky; they have perhaps never been below a cloud. Falling stars\r\noften follow the same direction for several hours, which direction\r\nis that of the wind. In the bay of Naples, M. Gay-Lussac and myself\r\nobserved luminous phenomena very analogous to those which fixed my\r\nattention during a long abode at Mexico and Quito. These meteors\r\nare perhaps modified by the nature of the soil and the air, like\r\ncertain effects of the looming or mirage, and of the terrestrial\r\nrefraction peculiar to the coasts of Calabria and Sicily.\r\n\r\nWhen we were forty leagues east of the island of Madeira, a\r\nswallow* (* Hirundo rustica, Linn.) perched on the topsail-yard. It\r\nwas so fatigued, that it suffered itself to be easily taken. It was\r\nremarkable that a bird, in that season, and in calm weather, should\r\nfly so far. In the expedition of d'Entrecasteaux, a common swallow\r\nwas seen 60 leagues distant from Cape Blanco; but this was towards\r\nthe end of October, and M. Labillardiere thought it had newly\r\narrived from Europe. We crossed these latitudes in June, at a\r\nperiod when the seas had not for a long time been agitated by\r\ntempests. I mention this last circumstance, because small birds and\r\neven butterflies, are sometimes forced out to sea by the\r\nimpetuosity of the winds, as we observed in the Pacific ocean, when\r\nwe were on the western coast of Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe Pizarro had orders to touch at the isle of Lancerota, one of\r\nthe seven great Canary Islands; and at five in the afternoon of the\r\n16th of June, that island appeared so distinctly in view that I was\r\nable to take the angle of altitude of a conic mountain, which\r\ntowered majestically over the other summits, and which we thought\r\nwas the great volcano which had occasioned such devastation on the\r\nnight of the 1st of September, 1730.\r\n\r\nThe current drew us toward the coast more rapidly than we wished.\r\nAs we advanced, we discovered at first the island of Forteventura,\r\nfamous for its numerous camels;* (* These camels, which serve for\r\nlabour, and sometimes for food, did not exist till the Bethencourts\r\nmade the conquest of the Canaries. In the sixteenth century, asses\r\nwere so abundant in the island of Forteventura, that they became\r\nwild and were hunted. Several thousands were killed to save the\r\nharvest. The horses of Forteventura are of singular beauty, and of\r\nthe Barbary race.--\"Noticias de la Historia General de las Islas\r\nCanarias\" por Don Jose de Viera, tome 2 page 436.) and a short time\r\nafter we saw the small island of Lobos in the channel which\r\nseparates Forteventura from Lancerota. We spent part of the night\r\non deck. The moon illumined the volcanic summits of Lancerota, the\r\nflanks of which, covered with ashes, reflected a silver light.\r\nAntares threw out its resplendent rays near the lunar disk, which\r\nwas but a few degrees above the horizon. The night was beautifully\r\nserene and cool. Though we were but a little distance from the\r\nAfrican coast, and on the limit of the torrid zone, the centigrade\r\nthermometer rose no higher than 18 degrees. The phosphorescence of\r\nthe ocean seemed to augment the mass of light diffused through the\r\nair. After midnight, great black clouds rising behind the volcano\r\nshrouded at intervals the moon and the beautiful constellation of\r\nthe Scorpion. We beheld lights carried to and fro on shore, which\r\nwere probably those of fishermen preparing for their labours. We\r\nhad been occasionally employed, during our passage, in reading the\r\nold voyages of the Spaniards, and these moving lights recalled to\r\nour fancy those which Pedro Gutierrez, page of Queen Isabella, saw\r\nin the isle of Guanahani, on the memorable night of the discovery\r\nof the New World.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th, in the morning, the horizon was foggy, and the sky\r\nslightly covered with vapour. The outlines of the mountains of\r\nLancerota appeared stronger: the humidity, increasing the\r\ntransparency of the air, seemed at the same time to have brought\r\nthe objects nearer our view. This phenomenon is well known to all\r\nwho have made hygrometrical observations in places whence the chain\r\nof the Higher Alps or of the Andes is seen. We passed through the\r\nchannel which divides the isle of Alegranza from Montana Clara,\r\ntaking soundings the whole way; and we examined the archipelago of\r\nsmall islands situated northward of Lancerota. In the midst of this\r\narchipelago, which is seldom visited by vessels bound for\r\nTeneriffe, we were singularly struck with the configuration of the\r\ncoasts. We thought ourselves transported to the Euganean mountains\r\nin the Vicentin, or the banks of the Rhine near Bonn. The form of\r\norganized beings varies according to the climate, and it is that\r\nextreme variety which renders the study of the geography of plants\r\nand animals so attractive; but rocks, more ancient perhaps than the\r\ncauses which have produced the difference of the climate on the\r\nglobe, are the same in both hemispheres. The porphyries containing\r\nvitreous feldspar and hornblende, the phonolite, the greenstone,\r\nthe amygdaloids, and the basalt, have forms almost as invariable as\r\nsimple crystallized substances. In the Canary Islands, and in the\r\nmountains of Auvergne, in the Mittelgebirge in Bohemia, in Mexico,\r\nand on the banks of the Ganges, the formation of trap is indicated\r\nby a symmetrical disposition of the mountains, by truncated cones,\r\nsometimes insulated, sometimes grouped, and by elevated plains,\r\nboth extremities of which are crowned by a conical rising.\r\n\r\nThe whole western part of Lancerota, of which we had a near view,\r\nbears the appearance of a country recently convulsed by volcanic\r\neruptions. Everything is black, parched, and stripped of vegetable\r\nmould. We distinguished, with our glasses, stratified basalt in\r\nthin and steeply-sloping strata. Several hills resembled the Monte\r\nNovo, near Naples, or those hillocks of scoria and ashes which the\r\nopening earth threw up in a single night at the foot of the volcano\r\nof Jorullo, in Mexico. In fact, the abbe Viera relates, that in\r\n1730, more than half the island changed its appearance. The great\r\nvolcano, which we have just mentioned, and which the inhabitants\r\ncall the volcano of Temanfaya, spread desolation over a most\r\nfertile and highly cultivated region: nine villages were entirely\r\ndestroyed by the lavas. This catastrophe had been preceded by a\r\ntremendous earthquake, and for several years shocks equally violent\r\nwere felt. This last phenomenon is so much the more singular, as it\r\nseldom happens after an eruption, when the elastic vapours have\r\nfound vent by the crater, after the ejection of the melted matter.\r\nThe summit of the great volcano is a rounded hill, but not entirely\r\nconic. From the angles of altitude which I took at different\r\ndistances, its absolute elevation did not appear to exceed three\r\nhundred toises. The neighbouring hills, and those of Alegranza and\r\nIsla Clara, were scarcely above one hundred or one hundred and\r\ntwenty toises. We may be surprised at the small elevation of these\r\nsummits, which, viewed from the sea, wear so majestic a form; but\r\nnothing is more uncertain than our judgment on the greatness of\r\nangles, which are subtended by objects close to the horizon. From\r\nillusions of this sort it arose, that before the measures of\r\nMessrs. de Churruca and Galleano, at Cape Pilar, navigators\r\nconsidered the mountains of the straits of Magellan, and those of\r\nTerra del Fuego, to be extremely elevated.\r\n\r\nThe island of Lancerota bore formerly the name of Titeroigotra. On\r\nthe arrival of the Spaniards, its inhabitants were distinguished\r\nfrom the other Canarians by marks of greater civilization. Their\r\nhouses were built with freestone, while the Guanches of Teneriffe\r\ndwelt in caverns. At Lancerota, a very singular custom prevailed at\r\nthat time, of which we find no example except among the people of\r\nThibet. A woman had several husbands, who alternately enjoyed the\r\nprerogatives due to the head of a family. A husband was considered\r\nas such only during a lunar revolution, and whilst his rights were\r\nexercised by others, he remained classed among the household\r\ndomestics. In the fifteenth century the island of Lancerota\r\ncontained two small distinct states, divided by a wall; a kind of\r\nmonument which outlives national enmities, and which we find in\r\nScotland, in China, and Peru.\r\n\r\nWe were forced by the winds to pass between the islands of\r\nAlegranza and Montana Clara, and as none on board the sloop had\r\nsailed through this passage, we were obliged to be continually\r\nsounding. We found from twenty-five to thirty-two fathoms. The lead\r\nbrought up an organic substance of so singular a structure that we\r\nwere for a long time doubtful whether it was a zoophyte or a kind\r\nof seaweed. The stem, of a brownish colour and three inches long,\r\nhas circular leaves with lobes, and indented at the edges. The\r\ncolour of these leaves is a pale green, and they are membranous and\r\nstreaked like those of the adiantums and Gingko biloba. Their\r\nsurface is covered with stiff whitish hairs; before their opening\r\nthey are concave, and enveloped one in the other. We observed no\r\nmark of spontaneous motion, no sign of irritability, not even on\r\nthe application of galvanic electricity. The stem is not woody, but\r\nalmost of a horny substance, like the stem of the Gorgons. Azote\r\nand phosphorus having been abundantly found in several cryptogamous\r\nplants, an appeal to chemistry would be useless to determine\r\nwhether this organized substance belonged to the animal or\r\nvegetable kingdom. Its great analogy to several sea-plants, with\r\nadiantum leaves, especially the genus caulerpa of M. Lamoureux, of\r\nwhich the Fucus proliter of Forskael is one of the numerous\r\nspecies, engaged us to rank it provisionally among the sea-wracks,\r\nand give it the name of Fucus vitifolius. The bristles which cover\r\nthis plant are found in several other fuci.* (* Fucus\r\nlycopodioides, and F. hirsutus.) The leaf, examined with a\r\nmicroscope at the instant we drew it up from the water, did not\r\npresent, it is true, those conglobate glands, or those opaque\r\npoints, which the parts of fructification in the genera of ulva and\r\nfucus contain; but how often do we find seaweeds in such a state\r\nthat we cannot yet distinguish any trace of seeds in their\r\ntransparent parenchyma.\r\n\r\nThe vine-leaved fucus presents a physiological phenomenon of the\r\ngreatest interest. Fixed to a piece of madrepore, this seaweed\r\nvegetates at the bottom of the ocean, at the depth of 192 feet,\r\nnotwithstanding which we found its leaves as green as those of our\r\ngrasses. According to the experiments of Bouguer, light is weakened\r\nafter a passage of 180 feet in the ratio of 1 to 1477.8. The\r\nseaweed of Alegranza consequently presents a new example of plants\r\nwhich vegetate in great obscurity without becoming white. Several\r\ngerms, enveloped in the bulbs of the lily tribes, the embryo of the\r\nmalvaceae, of the rhamnoides, of the pistacea, the viscum, and the\r\ncitrus, the branches of some subterraneous plants; in short,\r\nvegetables transported into mines, where the ambient air contains\r\nhydrogen or a great quantity of azote, become green without light.\r\nFrom these facts we are inclined to admit that it is not\r\nexclusively by the influence of the solar rays that this carburet\r\nof hydrogen is formed in the organs of plants, the presence of\r\nwhich makes the parenchyma appear of a lighter or darker green,\r\naccording as the carbon predominates in the mixture.\r\n\r\nMr. Turner, who has so well made known the family of the seaweeds,\r\nas well as many other celebrated botanists, are of opinion that\r\nmost of the fuci which we gather on the surface of the ocean, and\r\nwhich, from the 23rd to the 35th degree of latitude and 32nd of\r\nlongitude, appear to the mariner like a vast inundated meadow, grow\r\nprimitively at the bottom of the ocean, and float only in their\r\nripened state, when torn up by the motion of the waves. If this\r\nopinion be well founded, we must agree that the family of seaweeds\r\noffers formidable difficulties to naturalists, who persist in\r\nthinking that absence of light always produces whiteness; for how\r\ncan we admit that so many species of ulvaceae and dictyoteae, with\r\nstems and green leaves, which float on the ocean, have vegetated on\r\nrocks near the surface of the water?\r\n\r\nFrom some notions which the captain of the Pizarro had collected in\r\nan old Portuguese itinerary, he thought himself opposite to a small\r\nfort, situated north of Teguisa, the capital of the island of\r\nLancerota. Mistaking a rock of basalt for a castle, he saluted it\r\nby hoisting the Spanish flag, and sent a boat with an officer to\r\ninquire of the commandant whether any English vessels were cruising\r\nin the roads. We were not a little surprised to learn that the land\r\nwhich we had considered as a prolongation of the coast of\r\nLancerota, was the small island of Graciosa, and that for several\r\nleagues there was not an inhabited place. We took advantage of the\r\nboat to survey the land, which enclosed a large bay.\r\n\r\nThe small part of the island of Graciosa which we traversed,\r\nresembles those promontories of lava seen near Naples, between\r\nPortici and Torre del Greco. The rocks are naked, with no marks of\r\nvegetation, and scarcely any of vegetable soil. A few crustaceous\r\nlichen-like variolariae, leprariae, and urceorariae, were scattered\r\nabout upon the basalts. The lavas which are not covered with\r\nvolcanic ashes remain for ages without any appearance of\r\nvegetation. On the African soil excessive heat and lengthened\r\ndrought retard the growth of cryptogamous plants.\r\n\r\nThe basalts of Graciosa are not in columns, but are divided into\r\nstrata ten or fifteen inches thick. These strata are inclined at an\r\nangle of 80 degrees to the north-west. The compact basalt\r\nalternates with the strata of porous basalt and marl. The rock does\r\nnot contain hornblende, but great crystals of foliated olivine,\r\nwhich have a triple cleavage.* (* Blaettriger olivin.) This\r\nsubstance is decomposed with great difficulty. M. Hauy considers it\r\na variety of the pyroxene. The porous basalt, which passes into\r\nmandelstein, has oblong cavities from two to eight lines in\r\ndiameter, lined with chalcedony, enclosing fragments of compact\r\nbasalt. I did not remark that these cavities had the same\r\ndirection, or that the porous rock lay on compact strata, as\r\nhappens in the currents of lava of Etna and Vesuvius. The marl,* (*\r\nMergel.) which alternates more than a hundred times with the\r\nbasalts, is yellowish, friable by decomposition, very coherent in\r\nthe inside, and often divided into irregular prisms, analogous to\r\nthe basaltic prisms. The sun discolours their surface, as it\r\nwhitens several schists, by reviving a hydro-carburetted principle,\r\nwhich appears to be combined with the earth. The marl of Graciosa\r\ncontains a great quantity of chalk, and strongly effervesces with\r\nnitric acid, even on points where it is found in contact with the\r\nbasalt. This fact is the more remarkable, as this substance does\r\nnot fill the fissures of the rock, but its strata are parallel to\r\nthose of the basalt; whence we may conclude that both fossils are\r\nof the same formation, and have a common origin. The phenomenon of\r\na basaltic rock containing masses of indurated marl split into\r\nsmall columns, is also found in the Mittelgebirge, in Bohemia.\r\nVisiting those countries in 1792, in company with Mr. Freiesleben,\r\nwe even recognized in the marl of the Stiefelberg the imprint of a\r\nplant nearly resembling the Cerastium, or the Alsine. Are these\r\nstrata, contained in the trappean mountains, owing to muddy\r\nirruptions, or must we consider them as sediments of water, which\r\nalternate with volcanic deposits? This last hypothesis seems so\r\nmuch the less admissible, since, from the researches of Sir James\r\nHall on the influence of pressure in fusions, the existence of\r\ncarbonic acid in substances contained in basalt presents nothing\r\nsurprising. Several lavas of Vesuvius present similar phenomena. In\r\nLombardy, between Vicenza and Albano, where the calcareous stone of\r\nthe Jura contains great masses of basalt, I have seen the latter\r\nenter into effervescence with the acids wherever it touches the\r\ncalcareous rock.\r\n\r\nWe had not time to reach the summit of a hill very remarkable for\r\nhaving its base formed of banks of clay under strata of basalt,\r\nlike a mountain in Saxony, called the Scheibenbergen Hugel, which\r\nis become celebrated on account of the disputes of volcanean and\r\nneptunean geologists. These basalts were covered with a mammiform\r\nsubstance, which I vainly sought on the Peak of Teneriffe, and\r\nwhich is known by the names of volcanic glass, glass of Muller, or\r\nhyalite: it is the transition from the opal to the chalcedony. We\r\nstruck off with difficulty some fine specimens, leaving masses that\r\nwere eight or ten inches square untouched. I never saw in Europe\r\nsuch fine hyalites as I found in the island of Graciosa, and on the\r\nrock of porphyry called el Penol de los Banos, on the bank of the\r\nlake of Mexico.\r\n\r\nTwo kinds of sand cover the shore; one is black and basaltic, the\r\nother white and quartzose. In a place exposed to the rays of the\r\nsun, the first raised the thermometer to 51.2 degrees (41 degrees\r\nR.) and the second to 40 degrees (32 degrees R.) The temperature of\r\nthe air in the shade was 27.7 or 7.5 degrees higher than that of\r\nthe air over the sea. The quartzose sand contains fragments of\r\nfeldspar. It is thrown back by the water, and forms, in some sort,\r\non the surface of the rocks, small islets on which seaweed\r\nvegetates. Fragments of granite have been observed at Teneriffe;\r\nthe island of Gomora, from the details furnished me by M.\r\nBroussonnet, contains a nucleus of micaceous schist:--the quartz\r\ndisseminated in the sand, which we found on the shore of Graciosa,\r\nis a different substance from the lavas and the trappean porphyries\r\nso intimately connected with volcanic productions. From these facts\r\nit seems to be evident that in the Canary Islands, as well as on\r\nthe Andes of Quito, in Auvergne, in Greece, and throughout the\r\ngreater part of the globe, subterraneous fires have pierced through\r\nthe rocks of primitive formation. In treating hereafter of the\r\ngreat number of warm springs which we have seen issuing from\r\ngranite, gneiss, and micaceous schist, we shall have occasion to\r\nreturn to this subject, which is one of the most important of the\r\nphysical history of the globe.\r\n\r\nWe re-embarked at sunset, and hoisted sail, but the breeze was too\r\nfeeble to permit us to continue our course to Teneriffe. The sea\r\nwas calm; a reddish vapour covered the horizon, and seemed to\r\nmagnify every object. In this solitude, amidst so many uninhabited\r\nislets, we enjoyed for a long time the view of rugged and wild\r\nscenery. The black mountains of Graciosa appeared like\r\nperpendicular walls five or six hundred feet high. Their shadows,\r\nthrown over the surface of the ocean, gave a gloomy aspect to the\r\nscenery. Rocks of basalt, emerging from the bosom of the waters,\r\nwore the resemblance of the ruins of some vast edifice, and carried\r\nour thoughts back to the remote period when submarine volcanoes\r\ngave birth to new islands, or rent continents asunder. Every thing\r\nwhich surrounded us seemed to indicate destruction and sterility;\r\nbut the back-ground of the picture, the coasts of Lancerota\r\npresented a more smiling aspect. In a narrow pass between two\r\nhills, crowned with scattered tufts of trees, marks of cultivation\r\nwere visible. The last rays of the sun gilded the corn ready for\r\nthe sickle. Even the desert is animated wherever we can discover a\r\ntrace of the industry of man.\r\n\r\nWe endeavoured to get out of this bay by the pass which separates\r\nAlegranza from Montana Clara, and through which we had easily\r\nentered to land at the northern point of Graciosa. The wind having\r\nfallen, the currents drove us very near a rock, on which the sea\r\nbroke with violence, and which is noted in the old charts under the\r\nname of Hell, or Infierno. As we examined this rock at the distance\r\nof two cables' length, we found that it was a mass of lava three or\r\nfour toises high, full of cavities, and covered with scoriae\r\nresembling coke. We may presume that this rock,* (* I must here\r\nobserve, that this rock is noted on the celebrated Venetian chart\r\nof Andrea Bianco, but that the name of Infierno is given, as in the\r\nmore ancient chart of Picigano, made in 1367, to Teneriffe, without\r\ndoubt because the Guanches considered the peak as the entrance into\r\nhell. In the same latitudes an island made its appearance in 1811.)\r\nwhich modern charts call the West Rock (Roca del Oeste), was raised\r\nby volcanic fire; and it might heretofore have been much higher;\r\nfor the new island of the Azores, which rose from the sea at\r\nsuccessive periods, in 1638 and 1719, had reached 354 feet when it\r\ntotally disappeared in 1723, to the depth of 480 feet. This opinion\r\non the origin of the basaltic mass of the Infierno is confirmed by\r\na phenomenon, which was observed about the middle of the last\r\ncentury in these same latitudes. At the time of the eruption of the\r\nvolcano of Temanfaya, two pyramidal hills of lithoid lava rose from\r\nthe bottom of the ocean, and gradually united themselves with the\r\nisland of Lancerota.\r\n\r\nAs we were prevented by the fall of the wind, and by the currents,\r\nfrom repassing the channel of Alegranza, we resolved on tacking\r\nduring the night between the island of Clara and the West Rock.\r\nThis resolution had nearly proved fatal. A calm is very dangerous\r\nnear this rock, towards which the current drives with considerable\r\nforce. We began to feel the effects of this current at midnight.\r\nThe proximity of the stony masses, which rise perpendicularly above\r\nthe water, deprived us of the little wind which blew: the sloop no\r\nlonger obeyed the helm, and we dreaded striking every instant. It\r\nis difficult to conceive how a mass of basalt, insulated in the\r\nvast expanse of the ocean, can cause so considerable a motion of\r\nthe waters. These phenomena, worthy the attention of naturalists,\r\nare well known to mariners; they are extremely to be dreaded in the\r\nPacific ocean, particularly in the small archipelago of the islands\r\nof Galapagos. The difference of temperature which exists between\r\nthe fluid and the mass of rocks does not explain the direction\r\nwhich these currents take; and how can we admit that the water is\r\nengulfed at the base of these rocks, (which often are not of\r\nvolcanic origin) and that this continual engulfing determines the\r\nparticles of water to fill up the vacuum that takes place.\r\n\r\nThe wind having freshened a little towards the morning on the 18th,\r\nwe succeeded in passing the channel. We drew very near the Infierno\r\nthe second time, and remarked the large crevices, through which the\r\ngaseous fluids probably issued, when this basaltic mass was raised.\r\nWe lost sight of the small islands of Alegranza, Montana Clara, and\r\nGraciosa, which appear never to have been inhabited by the\r\nGuanches. They are now visited only for the purpose of gathering\r\narchil, which production is, however, less sought after, since so\r\nmany other lichens of the north of Europe have been found to yield\r\nmaterials proper for dyeing. Montana Clara is noted for its\r\nbeautiful canary-birds. The note of these birds varies with their\r\nflocks, like that of our chaffinches, which often differs in two\r\nneighbouring districts. Montana Clara yields pasture for goats, a\r\nfact which proves that the interior of this islet is less arid than\r\nits coasts. The name of Alegranza is synonymous with the Joyous,\r\n(La Joyeuse,) which denomination it received from the first\r\nconquerors of the Canary Islands, the two Norman barons, Jean de\r\nBethencourt and Gadifer de Salle. This was the first point on which\r\nthey landed. After remaining several days at Graciosa, a small part\r\nof which we examined, they conceived the project of taking\r\npossession of the neighbouring island of Lancerota, where they were\r\nwelcomed by Guadarfia, sovereign of the Guanches, with the same\r\nhospitality that Cortez found in the palace of Montezuma. The\r\nshepherd king, who had no other riches than his goats, became the\r\nvictim of base treachery, like the sultan of Mexico.\r\n\r\nWe sailed along the coasts of Lancerota, of the island of Lobos,\r\nand of Forteventura. The second of these islands seems to have\r\nanciently formed part of the two others. This geological hypothesis\r\nwas started in the seventeenth century by the Franciscan, Juan\r\nGalindo. That writer supposed that king Juba had named six Canary\r\nIslands only, because, in his time, three among them were\r\ncontiguous. Without admitting the probability of this hypothesis,\r\nsome learned geographers have imagined they recognized, in the two\r\nislands Nivaria and Ombrios, the Canaria and Capraria of the\r\nancients.\r\n\r\nThe haziness of the horizon prevented us, during the whole of our\r\npassage from Lancerota to Teneriffe, from discovering the summit of\r\nthe peak of Teyde. If the height of this volcano is 1905 toises, as\r\nthe last trigonometrical measure of Borda indicates, its summit\r\nought to be visible at a distance of 43 leagues, supposing the eye\r\non a level with the ocean, and a refraction equal to 0.079 of\r\ndistance. It has been doubted whether the peak has ever been seen\r\nfrom the channel which separates Lancerota from Forteventura, and\r\nwhich is distant from the volcano, according to the chart of\r\nVarela, 2 degrees 29 minutes, or nearly 50 leagues. This phenomenon\r\nappears nevertheless to have been verified by several officers of\r\nthe Spanish navy. I had in my hand, on board the Pizarro, a\r\njournal, in which it was noted, that the peak of Teneriffe had been\r\nseen at 135 miles distance, near the southern cape of Lancerota,\r\ncalled Pichiguera. Its summit was discovered under an angle\r\nconsiderable enough to lead the observer, Don Manual Baruti, to\r\nconclude that the volcano might have been visible at nine miles\r\nfarther. It was in September, towards evening, and in very damp\r\nweather. Reckoning fifteen feet for the elevation of the eye, I\r\nfind, that to render an account of this phenomenon, we must suppose\r\na refraction equal to 0.158 of the arch, which is not very\r\nextraordinary for the temperate zone. According to the observations\r\nof General Roy, the refractions vary in England from one-twentieth\r\nto one-third; and if it be true that they reach these extreme\r\nlimits on the coast of Africa, (which I much doubt,) the peak, in\r\ncertain circumstances, may be seen on the deck of a vessel as far\r\noff as 61 leagues.\r\n\r\nNavigators who have much frequented these latitudes, and who can\r\nreflect on the physical causes of the phenomena, are surprised that\r\nthe peaks of Teyde and of the Azores* (* The height of this peak of\r\nthe Azores, according to Fleurieu, is 1100 toises; to Ferrer, 1238\r\ntoises; and to Tofino, 1260 toises: but these measures are only\r\napproximative estimates. The captain of the Pizarro, Don Manuel\r\nCagigal, proved to me, by his journal, that he observed the peak of\r\nthe Azores at the distance of 37 leagues, when he was sure of his\r\nlatitude within two minutes. The volcano was seen at 4 degrees\r\nsouth-east, so that the error in longitude must have an almost\r\nimperceptible influence in the estimation of the distance.\r\nNevertheless, the angle which the peak of the Azores subtended was\r\nso great, that the captain of the Pizarro was of opinion this\r\nvolcano must be visible at more than 40 or 42 leagues. The distance\r\nof 37 leagues supposes an elevation of 1431 toises.) are sometimes\r\nvisible at a very great distance, though at other times they are\r\nnot seen when the distance is much less, and the sky appears serene\r\nand the horizon free from fogs. These circumstances are the more\r\nworthy of attention because vessels returning to Europe, sometimes\r\nwait impatiently for a sight of these mountains, to rectify their\r\nlongitude; and think themselves much farther off than they really\r\nare, when in fine weather these peaks are not perceptible at\r\ndistances where the angles subtended must be very considerable. The\r\nconstitution of the atmosphere has a great influence on the\r\nvisibility of distant objects. It may be admitted, that in general\r\nthe peak of Teneriffe is seldom seen at a great distance, in the\r\nwarm and dry months of July and August; and that, on the contrary,\r\nit is seen at very extraordinary distances in the months of January\r\nand February, when the sky is slightly clouded, and immediately\r\nafter a heavy rain, or a few hours before it falls. It appears that\r\nthe transparency of the air is prodigiously increased, as we have\r\nalready observed, when a certain quantity of water is uniformly\r\ndiffused through the atmosphere. Independent of these observations,\r\nit is not astonishing, that the peak of Teyde should be seldomer\r\nvisible at a very remote distance, than the summits of the Andes,\r\nto which, during so long a time, my observations were directed.\r\nThis peak, inferior in height to those parts of the chain of Mount\r\nAtlas at the foot of which is the city of Morocco, is not, like\r\nthose points, covered with perpetual snows. The Piton, or\r\nSugar-loaf, which terminates the peak, no doubt reflects a great\r\nquantity of light, owing to the whitish colour of the pumice-stone\r\nthrown up by the crater; but the height of that little truncated\r\ncone does not form a twenty-second part of the total elevation. The\r\nflanks of the volcano are covered either with blocks of black and\r\nscorified lava, or with a luxuriant vegetation, the masses of which\r\nreflect the less light, as the leaves of the trees are separated\r\nfrom each other by shadows of more considerable extent than that of\r\nthe part enlightened.\r\n\r\nHence it results that, setting aside the Piton, the peak of Teyde\r\nbelongs to that class of mountains, which, according to the\r\nexpression of Bouger, are seen at considerable distances only in a\r\nNEGATIVE MANNER, because they intercept the light which is\r\ntransmitted to us from the extreme limits of the atmosphere; and we\r\nperceive their existence only on account of the difference of\r\nintensity subsisting between the aerial light which surrounds them,\r\nand that which is reflected by the particles of air placed between\r\nthe mountains and the eye of the observer. As we withdraw from the\r\nisle of Teneriffe, the Piton or Sugar-loaf is seen for a\r\nconsiderable space of time in a POSITIVE MANNER, because it\r\nreflects a whitish light, and clearly detaches itself from the sky.\r\nBut as this cone is only 80 toises high, by 40 in breadth at its\r\nsummit, it has recently been a question whether, from the\r\ndiminutiveness of its mass, it can be visible at distances which\r\nexceed 40 leagues; and whether it be not probable, that navigators\r\ndistinguish the peaks as a small cloud above the horizon, only when\r\nthe base of the Piton begins to be visible on it. If we admit, that\r\nthe mean breadth of the Sugar-loaf is 100 toises, we find that the\r\nlittle cone, at 40 leagues distance, still subtends, in the\r\nhorizontal direction, an angle of more than three minutes. This\r\nangle is considerable enough to render an object visible; and if\r\nthe height of the Piton greatly exceeded its base, the angle in the\r\nhorizontal direction might be still smaller, and the object still\r\ncontinue to make an impression on our visual organs; for\r\nmicrometrical observations have proved that the limit of vision is\r\nbut a minute only, when the dimensions of the objects are the same\r\nin every direction. We distinguish at a distance, by the eye only,\r\ntrunks of trees insulated in a vast plain, though the subtended\r\nangle be under twenty-five seconds.\r\n\r\nAs the visibility of an object detaching itself in a brown colour,\r\ndepends on the quantities of light which the eye meets on two\r\nlines, one of which ends at the mountain, and the other extends to\r\nthe surface of the aerial ocean, it follows that the farther we\r\nremove from the object, the smaller the difference becomes between\r\nthe light of the surrounding atmosphere, and that of the strata of\r\nair before the mountain. For this reason, when less elevated\r\nsummits begin to appear above the horizon, they present themselves\r\nat first under a darker hue than those we discern at very great\r\ndistances. In the same manner, the visibility of mountains seen\r\nonly in a negative manner, does not depend solely on the state of\r\nthe lower regions of the air, to which our meteorological\r\nobservations are limited, but also on the transparency and physical\r\nconstitution of the air in the most elevated parts; for the image\r\ndetaches itself better in proportion as the aerial light, which\r\ncomes from the limits of the atmosphere, has been originally more\r\nintense, or has undergone less loss in its passage. This\r\nconsideration explains to a certain point, why, under a perfectly\r\nserene sky, the state of the thermometer and the hygrometer being\r\nprecisely the same in the air nearest the earth, the peak is\r\nsometimes visible, and at other times invisible, to navigators at\r\nequal distances. It is even probable, that the chance of perceiving\r\nthis volcano would not be greater, if the ashy cone, at the summit\r\nof which is the mouth of the crater, were equal, as in Vesuvius, to\r\na quarter of the total height. These ashes, being pumice-stone\r\ncrumbled into dust, do not reflect as much light as the snow of the\r\nAndes; and they cause the mountain, seen from afar, to detach\r\nitself not in a bright, but in a dark hue. The ashes also\r\ncontribute, if we may use the expression, to equalize the portions\r\nof aerial light, the variable difference of which renders the\r\nobject more or less distinctly visible. Calcareous mountains,\r\ndevoid of vegetable earth, summits covered with granitic sand, the\r\nhigh savannahs of the Cordilleras,* (* Los Pajonales, from paja,\r\nstraw. This is the name given to the region of the gramina, which\r\nencircles the zone of the perpetual snows.) which are of a golden\r\nyellow, are undoubtedly distinguished at small distances better\r\nthan objects which are seen in a negative manner; but the theory\r\nindicates a certain limit, beyond which these last detach\r\nthemselves more distinctly from the azure vault of the sky.\r\n\r\nThe colossal summits of Quito and Peru, towering above the limit of\r\nthe perpetual snows, concentre all the peculiarities which must\r\nrender them visible at very small angles. The circular summit of\r\nthe peak of Teneriffe is only a hundred toises in diameter.\r\nAccording to the measures I made at Riobamba, in 1803, the dome of\r\nthe Chimborazo, 153 toises below its summit, consequently in a\r\npoint which is 1300 toises higher than the peak, is still 673\r\ntoises (1312 metres) in breadth. The zone of perpetual snows also\r\nforms a fourth of the height of the mountain; and the base of this\r\nzone, seen on the coast of the Pacific, fills an extent of 3437\r\ntoises (6700 metres). But though Chimborazo is two-thirds higher\r\nthan the peak, we do not see it, on account of the curve of the\r\nglobe, at more than 38 miles and a third farther distant. The\r\nradiant brilliancy of its snows, when, at the port of Guayaquil, at\r\nthe close of the rainy season, Chimborazo is discerned on the\r\nhorizon, may lead us to suppose, that it must be seen at a very\r\ngreat distance in the South Sea. Pilots highly worthy of credit\r\nhave assured me, that they have seen it from the rock of Muerto, to\r\nthe south west of the isle of Puna, at a distance of 47 leagues.\r\nWhenever it has been seen at a greater distance, the observers,\r\nuncertain of their longitude, have not been in a situation to\r\nfurnish precise data.\r\n\r\nAerial light, projected on mountains, increases the visibility of\r\nthose which are seen positively; its power diminishes, on the\r\ncontrary, the visibility of objects which, like the peak of\r\nTeneriffe and that of the Azores, detach themselves in a brown\r\ntint. Bouguer, relying on theoretical considerations, was of\r\nopinion that, according to the constitution of our atmosphere,\r\nmountains seen negatively cannot be perceived at distances\r\nexceeding 35 leagues. It is important here to observe, that these\r\ncalculations are contrary to experience. The peak of Teneriffe has\r\nbeen often seen at the distance of 36, 38, and even at 40 leagues.\r\nMoreover, in the vicinity of the Sandwich Islands, the summit of\r\nMowna-Roa, at a season when it was without snows, has been seen on\r\nthe skirt of the horizon, at the distance of 53 leagues. This is\r\nthe most striking example we have hitherto known of the visibility\r\nof a mountain; and it is the more remarkable, that an object seen\r\nnegatively furnishes this example.\r\n\r\nThe volcanoes of Teneriffe, and of the Azores, the Sierra Nevada of\r\nSanta Martha, the peak of Orizaba, the Silla of Caracas, Mowna-Roa,\r\nand Mount St. Elias, insulated in the vast extent of the seas, or\r\nplaced on the coasts of continents, serve as sea-marks to direct\r\nthe pilot, when he has no means of determining the position of the\r\nvessel by the observation of the stars; everything which has a\r\nrelation to the visibility of these natural seamarks, is\r\ninteresting to the safety of navigation.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.2.\r\n\r\nSTAY AT TENERIFE.\r\nJOURNEY FROM SANTA CRUZ TO OROTAVA.\r\nEXCURSION TO THE SUMMIT OF THE PEAK OF TEYDE.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of our departure from Graciosa, the horizon continued\r\nso hazy, that, notwithstanding the considerable height of the\r\nmountains of Canary,* (* Isla de la Gran Canaria.) we did not\r\ndiscover that island till the evening of the 18th of June. It is\r\nthe granary of the archipelago of the Fortunate Islands; and, what\r\nis very remarkable in a region situated beyond the limits of the\r\ntropics, we were assured, that in some districts, there are two\r\nwheat harvests in the year; one in February, and the other in June.\r\nCanary has never been visited by a learned mineralogist; yet this\r\nisland is so much the more worthy of observation, as the\r\nphysiognomy of its mountains, disposed in parallel chains, appeared\r\nto me to differ entirely from that of the summits of Lancerota and\r\nTeneriffe. Nothing is more interesting to the geologist, than to\r\nobserve the relations, on the same point of the globe, between\r\nvolcanic countries, and those which are primitive or secondary.\r\nWhen the Canary Islands shall have been examined, in all the parts\r\nwhich compose the system of these mountains, we shall find that we\r\nhave been too precipitate in considering the whole group as raised\r\nby the action of submarine fires.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 19th, we discovered the point of Naga, but\r\nthe peak of Teneriffe was still invisible: the land, obscured by a\r\nthick mist, presented forms that were vague and confused. As we\r\napproached the road of Santa Cruz we observed that the mist, driven\r\nby the winds, drew nearer to us. The sea was strongly agitated, as\r\nit most commonly is in those latitudes. We anchored after several\r\nsoundings, for the mist was so thick, that we could scarcely\r\ndistinguish objects at a few cables' distance; but at the moment we\r\nbegan to salute the place, the fog was instantly dispelled. The\r\npeak of Teyde appeared in a break above the clouds, and the first\r\nrays of the sun, which had not yet risen on us, illumined the\r\nsummit of the volcano.\r\n\r\nWe hastened to the prow of the vessel to behold the magnificent\r\nspectacle, and at the same instant we saw four English vessels\r\nlying to, and very near our stern. We had passed without being\r\nperceived, and the same mist which had concealed the peak from our\r\nview, had saved us from the risk of being carried back to Europe.\r\nThe Pizarro stood in as close as possible to the fort, to be under\r\nits protection. It was on this shore, that, in the landing\r\nattempted by the English two years before our arrival, in July\r\n1797, admiral Nelson had his arm carried off by a cannon-ball.\r\n\r\nThe situation of the town of Santa Cruz is very similar to that of\r\nLa Guayra, the most frequented port of the province of Caraccas.\r\nThe heat is excessive in both places, and from the same causes; but\r\nthe aspect of Santa Cruz is more gloomy. On a narrow and sandy\r\nbeach, houses of dazzling whiteness, with flat roofs, and windows\r\nwithout glass, are built close against a wall of black\r\nperpendicular rock, devoid of vegetation. A fine mole, built of\r\nfreestone, and the public walk planted with poplars, are the only\r\nobjects which break the sameness of the landscape. The view of the\r\npeak, as it presents itself above Santa Cruz, is much less\r\npicturesque than that we enjoy from the port of Orotava. There, a\r\nhighly cultured and smiling plain presents a pleasing contrast to\r\nthe wild aspect of the volcano. From the groups of palm trees and\r\nbananas which line the coast, to the region of the arbutus, the\r\nlaurel, and the pine, the volcanic rock is crowned with luxuriant\r\nvegetation. We easily conceive how the inhabitants, even of the\r\nbeautiful climates of Greece and Italy, might fancy they recognised\r\none of the Fortunate Isles in the western part of Teneriffe. The\r\neastern side, that of Santa Cruz, on the contrary, is every where\r\nstamped with sterility. The summit of the peak is not more arid\r\nthan the promontory of basaltic lava, which stretches towards the\r\npoint of Naga, and on which succulent plants, springing up in the\r\nclefts of the rocks, scarcely indicate a preparation of soil. At\r\nthe port of Orotava, the top of the Piton subtends an angle in\r\nheight of more than eleven degrees and a half; while at the mole of\r\nSanta Cruz* (* The oblique distances from the top of the volcano to\r\nOrotava and to Santa Cruz are nearly 8600 toises and 22,500 toises.)\r\nthe angle scarcely exceeds 4 degrees 36 minutes.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this difference, and though in the latter place the\r\nvolcano rises above the horizon scarcely as much as Vesuvius seen\r\nfrom the mole of Naples, the aspect of the peak is still very\r\nmajestic, when those who anchor in the road discern it for the\r\nfirst time. The Piton alone was visible to us; its cone projected\r\nitself on a sky of the purest blue, whilst dark thick clouds\r\nenveloped the rest of the mountain to the height of 1800 toises.\r\nThe pumice-stone, illumined by the first rays of the sun, reflected\r\na reddish light, like that which tinges the summits of the higher\r\nAlps. This light by degrees becomes dazzlingly white; and, deceived\r\nlike most travellers, we thought that the peak was still covered\r\nwith snow, and that we should with difficulty reach the edge of the\r\ncrater.\r\n\r\nWe have remarked, in the Cordillera of the Andes, that the conical\r\nmountains, such as Cotopaxi and Tungurahua, are oftener seen free\r\nfrom clouds, than those of which the tops are broken into bristly\r\npoints, like Antisana and Pichincha; but the peak of Teneriffe,\r\nnotwithstanding its pyramidical form, is a great part of the year\r\nenveloped in vapours, and is sometimes, during several weeks,\r\ninvisible from the road of Santa Cruz. Its position to the west of\r\nan immense continent, and its insulated situation in the midst of\r\nthe sea, are no doubt the causes of this phenomenon. Navigators are\r\nwell aware that even the smallest islets, and those which are\r\nwithout mountains, collect and harbour the clouds. The decrement of\r\nheat is also different above the plains of Africa, and above the\r\nsurface of the Atlantic; and the strata of air, brought by the\r\ntrade winds, cool in proportion as they advance towards the west.\r\nIf the air has been extremely dry above the burning sands of the\r\ndesert, it is very quickly saturated when it enters into contact\r\nwith the surface of the sea, or with the air that lies on that\r\nsurface. It is easy to conceive, therefore, why vapours become\r\nvisible in the atmospherical strata, which, at a distance from the\r\ncontinent, have no longer the same temperature as when they began\r\nto be saturated with water. The considerable mass of a mountain,\r\nrising in the midst of the Atlantic, is also an obstacle to the\r\nclouds, which are driven out to sea by the winds.\r\n\r\nOn entering the streets of Santa Cruz, we felt a suffocating heat,\r\nthough the thermometer was not above twenty-five degrees. Those who\r\nhave for a long time inhaled the air of the sea suffer every time\r\nthey land; not because this air contains more oxygen than the air\r\non shore, as has been erroneously supposed, but because it is less\r\ncharged with those gaseous combinations, which the animal and\r\nvegetable substances, and the mud resulting from their\r\ndecomposition, pour into the atmosphere. Miasms that escape\r\nchemical analysis have a powerful effect on our organs, especially\r\nwhen they have not for a long while been exposed to the same kind\r\nof irritation.\r\n\r\nSanta Cruz, the Anaza of the Guanches, is a neat town, with a\r\npopulation of 8000 souls. I was not struck with the vast number of\r\nmonks and secular ecclesiastics, which travellers have thought\r\nthemselves bound to find in every country under the Spanish\r\ngovernment; nor shall I stop to enter into the description of the\r\nchurches; the library of the Dominicans, which contains scarcely a\r\nfew hundred volumes; the mole, where the inhabitants assemble to\r\ninhale the freshness of the evening breeze; or the famed monument\r\nof Carrara marble, thirty feet high, dedicated to Our Lady of\r\nCandelaria, in memory of the miraculous appearance of the Virgin,\r\nin 1392, at Chimisay, near Guimar. The port of Santa Cruz may be\r\nconsidered as a great caravanserai, on the road to America and the\r\nIndies. Every traveller who writes the narrative of his adventures,\r\nbegins by a description of Madeira and Teneriffe; and if in the\r\nnatural history of these islands there yet remains an immense field\r\nuntrodden, we must admit that the topography of the little towns of\r\nFunchal, Santa Cruz, Laguna, and Orotava, leaves scarcely anything\r\nuntold.\r\n\r\nThe recommendation of the court of Madrid procured for us, in the\r\nCanaries, as in all the other Spanish possessions, the most\r\nsatisfactory reception. The captain-general gave us immediate\r\npermission to examine the island. Colonel Armiaga, who commanded a\r\nregiment of infantry, received us into his house with kind\r\nhospitality. We could not cease admiring the banana, the papaw\r\ntree, the Poinciana pulcherrima, and other plants, which we had\r\nhitherto seen only in hot-houses, cultivated in his garden in the\r\nopen air. The climate of the Canaries however is not warm enough to\r\nripen the real Platano Arton, with triangular fruit from seven to\r\neight inches long, and which, requiring a temperature of 24\r\ncentesimal degrees, does not flourish even in the valley of\r\nCaracas. The bananas of Teneriffe are those named by the Spanish\r\nplanters Camburis or Guineos, and Dominicos. The Camburi, which\r\nsuffers least from cold, is cultivated with success even at Malaga,\r\nwhere the temperature is only 18 degrees; but the fruit we see\r\noccasionally at Cadiz comes from the Canary Islands by vessels\r\nwhich make the passage in three or four days. In general, the musa,\r\nknown by every people under the torrid zone, though hitherto never\r\nfound in a wild state, has as great a variety of fruit as our apple\r\nand pear trees. These varieties, which are confounded by the\r\ngreater part of botanists, though they require very different\r\nclimates, have become permanent by long cultivation.\r\n\r\nWe went to herborize in the evening in the direction of the fort of\r\nPasso Alto, along the basaltic rocks that close the promontory of\r\nNaga. We were very little satisfied with our harvest, for the\r\ndrought and dust had almost destroyed vegetation. The Cacalia\r\nKleinia, the Euphorbia canariensis, and several other succulent\r\nplants, which draw their nourishment from the air rather than the\r\nsoil on which they grow, reminded us by their appearance, that this\r\ngroup of islands belongs to Africa, and even to the most arid part\r\nof that continent.\r\n\r\nThough the captain of the Pizarro had orders to stop long enough at\r\nTeneriffe to give us time to scale the summit of the peak, if the\r\nsnows did not prevent our ascent, we received notice, on account of\r\nthe blockade of the English ships, not to expect a longer delay\r\nthan four or five days. We consequently hastened our departure for\r\nthe port of Orotava, which is situated on the western declivity of\r\nthe volcano, where we were sure of finding guides. I could find no\r\none at Santa Cruz who had mounted the peak, and I was not surprised\r\nat this. The most curious objects become less interesting, in\r\nproportion as they are near to us; and I have known inhabitants of\r\nSchaffhausen, in Switzerland, who had never seen the fall of the\r\nRhine but at a distance.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of June, before sunrise, we began our excursion by\r\nascending to the Villa de Laguna, estimated to be at the elevation\r\nof 350 toises above the port of Santa Cruz. We could not verify\r\nthis estimate of the height, the surf not having permitted us to\r\nreturn on board during the night, to take our barometers and\r\ndipping-needle. As we foresaw that our expedition to the peak would\r\nbe very precipitate, we consoled ourselves with the reflection that\r\nit was well not to expose instruments which were to serve us in\r\ncountries less known by Europeans. The road by which we ascended to\r\nLaguna is on the right of a torrent, or baranco, which in the rainy\r\nseason forms fine cascades; it is narrow and tortuous. Near the\r\ntown we met some white camels, which seemed to be very slightly\r\nladen. The chief employment of these animals is to transport\r\nmerchandise from the custom-house to the warehouses of the\r\nmerchants. They are generally laden with two chests of Havannah\r\nsugar, which together weigh 900 pounds; but this load may be\r\naugmented to thirteen hundred-weight, or 52 arrobas of Castile.\r\nCamels are not numerous at Teneriffe, whilst they exist by\r\nthousands in the two islands of Lancerota and Forteventura; the\r\nclimate and vegetation of these islands, which are situated nearer\r\nAfrica, are more analogous to those of that continent. It is very\r\nextraordinary, that this useful animal, which breeds in South\r\nAmerica, should be seldom propagated at Teneriffe. In the fertile\r\ndistrict of Adexe only, where the plantations of the sugar-cane are\r\nmost considerable, camels have sometimes been known to breed. These\r\nbeasts of burden, as well as horses, were brought into the Canary\r\nIslands in the fifteenth century by the Norman conquerors. The\r\nGuanches were previously unacquainted with them; and this fact\r\nseems to be very well accounted for by the difficulty of\r\ntransporting an animal of such bulk in frail canoes, without the\r\nnecessity of considering the Guanches as a remnant of the people of\r\nAtlantis, or a different race from that of the western Africans.\r\n\r\nThe hill, on which the town of San Christobal de la Laguna is\r\nbuilt, belongs to the system of basaltic mountains, which,\r\nindependent of the system of less ancient volcanic rocks, form a\r\nbroad girdle around the peak of Teneriffe. The basalt on which we\r\nwalked was darkish brown, compact, half-decomposed, and when\r\nbreathed on, emitted a clayey smell. We discovered amphibole,\r\nolivine,* (* Peridot granuliforme. Hauy.) and translucid pyroxenes,\r\n* (* Augite.--Werner.) with a perfectly lamellar fracture, of a\r\npale olive green, and often crystallized in prisms of six planes.\r\nThe first of these substances is extremely rare at Teneriffe; and I\r\nnever found it in the lavas of Vesuvius; but those of Etna contain\r\nit in abundance. Notwithstanding the great number of blocks, which\r\nwe stopped to break, to the great regret of our guides, we could\r\ndiscover neither nepheline, leucite,* (* Amphigene.--Hauy.) nor\r\nfeldspar. This last, which is so common in the basaltic lavas of\r\nthe island of Ischia, does not begin to appear at Teneriffe, till\r\nwe approach the volcano. The rock of Laguna is not columnar, but is\r\ndivided into ledges, of small thickness, and inclined to the east\r\nat an angle of 30 or 40 degrees. It has nowhere the appearance of a\r\ncurrent of lava flowing from the sides of the peak. If the present\r\nvolcano has given birth to these basalts, we must suppose, that,\r\nlike the substances which compose the Somma, at the back of\r\nVesuvius, they are the effect of a submarine effusion, in which the\r\nliquid mass has formed strata. A few arborescent Euphorbias, the\r\nCacalia Kleinia, and Indian figs (Cactus), which have become wild\r\nin the Canary Islands, as well as in the south of Europe and the\r\nwhole continent of Africa, are the only plants we see on these arid\r\nrocks. The feet of our mules were slipping every moment on beds of\r\nstone, which were very steep. We nevertheless recognized the\r\nremains of an ancient pavement. In these colonies we discover at\r\nevery step some traces of that activity which characterized the\r\nSpanish nation in the 16th century.\r\n\r\nAs we approached Laguna, we felt the temperature of the atmosphere\r\ngradually become lower. This sensation was so much the more\r\nagreeable, as we found the air of Santa Cruz very oppressive. As\r\nour organs are more affected by disagreeable impressions, the\r\nchange of temperature becomes still more sensible when we return\r\nfrom Laguna to the port: we seem then to be drawing near the mouth\r\nof a furnace. The same impression is felt, when, on the coast of\r\nCaracas, we descend from the mountain of Avila to the port of La\r\nGuayra. According to the law of the decrement of heat, three\r\nhundred and fifty toises in height produce in this latitude only\r\nthree or four degrees difference in temperature. The heat which\r\noverpowers the traveller on his entrance into Santa Cruz, or La\r\nGuayra, must consequently be attributed to the reverberation from\r\nthe rocks, against which these towns are built.\r\n\r\nThe perpetual coolness which prevails at Laguna causes it to be\r\nconsidered in the Canaries a delightful abode. Situated in a small\r\nplain, surrounded by gardens, protected by a hill which is crowned\r\nby a wood of laurels, myrtle, and arbutus, the capital of Teneriffe\r\nis very beautifully placed. We should be mistaken if, relying on\r\nthe account of some travellers, we believed it seated on the border\r\nof a lake. The rain sometimes forms a sheet of water of\r\nconsiderable extent; and the geologist, who beholds in everything\r\nthe past rather than the present state of nature, can have no doubt\r\nbut that the whole plain is a great basin dried up. Laguna has\r\nfallen from its opulence, since the lateral eruptions of the\r\nvolcano have destroyed the port of Garachico, and since Santa Cruz\r\nhas become the central point of the commerce of the island. It\r\ncontains only 9000 inhabitants, of whom nearly 400 are monks,\r\ndistributed in six convents. The town is surrounded with a great\r\nnumber of windmills, which indicate the cultivation of wheat in\r\nthese high countries. I shall observe on this occasion, that\r\ndifferent kinds of grain were known to the Guanches. They called\r\nwheat at Teneriffe tano, at Lancerota triffa; barley, in the grand\r\nCanary, bore the name of aramotanoque, and at Lancerota it was\r\ncalled tamosen. The flour of roasted barley (gofio) and goat's-milk\r\nconstituted the principal food of the people, on the origin of\r\nwhich so many systematic fables have been current. These aliments\r\nsufficiently prove that the race of the Guanches belonged to the\r\nnations of the old continent, perhaps to those of Caucasus, and not\r\nlike the rest of the Atlantides,* to the inhabitants of the New\r\nWorld (* Without entering here into any discussion respecting the\r\nexistence of the Atlantis, I may cite the opinion of Diodorus\r\nSiculus, according to whom the Atlantides were ignorant of the use\r\nof corn, because they were separated from the rest of mankind\r\nbefore these gramina were cultivated.); these, before the arrival\r\nof the Europeans, were unacquainted with corn, milk, and cheese.\r\n\r\nA great number of chapels, which the Spaniards call ermitas,\r\nencircle the town of Laguna. Shaded by trees of perpetual verdure,\r\nand erected on small eminences, these chapels add to the\r\npicturesque effect of the landscape. The interior of the town is\r\nnot equal to its external appearance. The houses are solidly built,\r\nbut very antique, and the streets seem deserted. A botanist ought\r\nnot to complain of the antiquity of the edifices. The roofs and\r\nwalls are covered with Canary house-leek and those elegant\r\ntrichomanes, mentioned by every traveller. These plants are\r\nnourished by the abundant mists.\r\n\r\nMr. Anderson, the naturalist in the third voyage of captain Cook,\r\nadvises physicians to send their patients to Teneriffe, on account\r\nof the mildness of the temperature and the equal climate of the\r\nCanaries. The ground on these islands rises in an amphitheatre, and\r\npresents simultaneously, as in Peru and Mexico, the temperature of\r\nevery climate, from the heat of Africa to the cold of the higher\r\nAlps. Santa Cruz, the port of Orotava, the town of the same name,\r\nand that of Laguna, are four places, the mean temperatures of which\r\nform a descending series. In the south of Europe the change of the\r\nseasons is too sensibly felt to present the same advantages.\r\nTeneriffe, on the contrary, situated as it were on the threshold of\r\nthe tropics, though but a few days' sail from Spain, shares in the\r\ncharms which nature has lavished on the equinoctial regions.\r\nVegetation here displays some of her fairest and most majestic\r\nforms in the banana and the palm-tree. He who is alive to the\r\ncharms of nature finds in this delicious island remedies still more\r\npotent than the climate. No abode appeared to me more fitted to\r\ndissipate melancholy, and restore peace to the perturbed mind, than\r\nthat of Teneriffe or Madeira. These advantages are the effect not\r\nof the beauty of the site and the purity of the air alone: the\r\nmoral feeling is no longer harrowed up by the sight of slavery, the\r\npresence of which is so revolting in the West Indies, and in every\r\nother place to which European colonists have conveyed what they\r\ncall their civilization and their industry.\r\n\r\nIn winter the climate of Laguna is extremely foggy, and the\r\ninhabitants often complain of the cold. A fall of snow, however,\r\nhas never been seen; a fact which may seem to indicate that the\r\nmean temperature of this town must be above 18.7 degrees (15\r\ndegrees R.), that is to say, higher than that of Naples. I do not\r\nlay this down as an unexceptional conclusion, for in winter the\r\nrefrigeration of the clouds does not depend so much on the mean\r\ntemperature of the whole year, as on the instantaneous diminution\r\nof heat to which a district is exposed by its local situation. The\r\nmean temperature of the capital of Mexico, for instance, is only\r\n16.8 degrees (13.5 degrees R.), nevertheless, in the space of a\r\nhundred years snow has fallen only once, while in the south of\r\nEurope and in Africa it snows in places where the mean temperature\r\nis above 19 degrees.\r\n\r\nThe vicinity of the sea renders the climate of Laguna more mild in\r\nwinter than might be expected, arising from its elevation above the\r\nlevel of the ocean. I was astonished to learn that M. Broussonnet\r\nhad planted in the midst of this town, in the garden of the Marquis\r\nde Nava, the bread-fruit tree (Artocarpus incisa), and\r\ncinnamon-tree (Laurus Cinnamomum). These valuable productions of\r\nthe South Sea and the East Indies are naturalized there as well as\r\nat Orotava. Does not this fact prove that the bread-fruit might\r\nflourish in Calabria, Sicily, and Granada? The culture of the\r\ncoffee-tree has not equally succeeded at Laguna, though its fruit\r\nripens at Teguesta, as well as between the port of Orotava and the\r\nvillage of St. Juan de la Rambla. It is probable that some local\r\ncircumstances, perhaps the nature of the soil and the winds that\r\nprevail in the flowering season, are the cause of this phenomenon.\r\nIn other regions, in the neighbourhood of Naples, for instance, the\r\ncoffee-tree thrives abundantly, though the mean temperature\r\nscarcely rises above 18 centigrade degrees.\r\n\r\nNo person has ascertained in the island of Teneriffe, the lowest\r\nheight at which snow falls every year. This fact, though easy of\r\nverification by barometrical measurements, has hitherto been\r\ngenerally neglected under every zone. It is nevertheless highly\r\ninteresting both to agriculture in the colonies and meteorology,\r\nand fully as important as the measure of the limit of the perpetual\r\nsnows. My observations furnished me with the data, set down in the\r\nfollowing table:--\r\n\r\nColumn 1: North latitude.\r\n\r\nColumn 2: Lowest height in toises at which snow falls.\r\n\r\nColumn 3: Lowest height in metres at which snow falls.\r\n\r\nColumn 4: Inferior limit in toises of the perpetual snows.\r\n\r\nColumn 5: Inferior limit in metres of the perpetual snows.\r\n\r\nColumn 6: Difference in toises of columns 4 and 5.\r\n\r\nColumn 7: Difference in metres of columns 4 and 5.\r\n\r\nColumn 8: Mean temperature degrees centigrade.\r\n\r\nColumn 9: Mean temperature degrees Reaum.\r\n\r\n  0  : 2040 : 3976 : 2460 : 4794 :  420 :  818 : 27   : 21.6.\r\n\r\n  20 : 1550 : 3020 : 2360 : 4598 :  810 : 1578 : 24.5 : 19.6.\r\n\r\n  40 :    0 :    0 : 1540 : 3001 : 1540 : 3001 : 17   : 13.6.\r\n\r\nThis table presents only the ordinary state of nature, that is to\r\nsay, the phenomena as they are annually observed. Exceptions\r\nfounded on particular local circumstances, exist. Thus it sometimes\r\nsnows, though seldom, at Naples, at Lisbon, and even at Malaga,\r\nconsequently as low as the 37th degree of latitude: and, as we have\r\njust observed, snow has been seen to fall at Mexico, the elevation\r\nof which is 1173 toises above the level of the ocean. This\r\nphenomenon, which had not been seen for several centuries, took\r\nplace on the day that the Jesuits were expelled, and was attributed\r\nby the people to that act of severity. A more striking exception\r\nwas found in the climate of Valladolid, the capital of the province\r\nof Mechoacan. According to my measures, the height of this town,\r\nsituate in latitude 19 degrees 42 minutes, is only a thousand\r\ntoises: and yet, a few years before our arrival in New Spain, the\r\nstreets were covered with snow for some hours.\r\n\r\nSnow had been seen to fall also at Teneriffe, in a place lying\r\nabove Esperanza de la Laguna, very near the town of that name, in\r\nthe gardens of which the artocarpus flourishes. This extraordinary\r\nfact was confirmed to M. Broussonnet by very aged persons. The\r\nErica arborea, the Myrica Faya, and the Arbutus callicarpa,* (*\r\nThis fine arbutus, imported by M. Broussonnet, is very different\r\nfrom the Arbutus laurifolia, with which it has been confounded, but\r\nwhich belongs to North America.) did not suffer from the snow; but\r\nit destroyed all the vines in the open air. This observation is\r\ninteresting to vegetable physiology. In hot countries, the plants\r\nare so vigorous, that cold is less injurious to them, provided it\r\nbe of short duration. I have seen the banana cultivated in the\r\nisland of Cuba, in places where the thermometer descends to seven\r\ncentesimal degrees, and sometimes very near freezing point. In\r\nItaly and Spain the orange and date-trees do not perish, though the\r\ncold during the night may be two degrees below freezing point. In\r\ngeneral it is remarked by cultivators, that the trees which grow in\r\na fertile soil are less delicate, and consequently less affected by\r\ngreat changes in the temperature, than those which grow in land\r\nthat affords but little nutriment.* (* The mulberries, cultivated\r\nin the thin and sandy soils of countries bordering on the Baltic\r\nSea, are examples of this feebleness of organization. The late\r\nfrosts do more injury to them, than to the mulberries of Piedmont.\r\nIn Italy a cold of 5 degrees below freezing point does not destroy\r\nrobust orange trees. According to M. Galesio, these trees, less\r\ntender than the lemon and bergamot orange trees, freeze only at ten\r\ncentesimal degrees below freezing point.)\r\n\r\nIn order to pass from the town of Laguna to the port of Orotava and\r\nthe western coast of Teneriffe, we cross at first a hilly region\r\ncovered with black and argillaceous earth, in which are found some\r\nsmall crystals of pyroxene. The waters most probably detach these\r\ncrystals from the neighbouring rocks, as at Frascati, near Rome.\r\nUnfortunately, strata of ferruginous earth conceal the soil from\r\nthe researches of the geologist. It is only in some ravines, that\r\nwe find columnar basalts, somewhat curved, and above them very\r\nrecent breccia, resembling volcanic tufa. The breccia contain\r\nfragments of the same basalts which they cover; and it is asserted\r\nthat marine petrifactions are observed in them. The same phenomenon\r\noccurs in the Vicentin, near Montechio Maggiore.\r\n\r\nThe valley of Tacoronte is the entrance into that charming country,\r\nof which travellers of every nation have spoken with rapturous\r\nenthusiasm. Under the torrid zone I found sites where nature is\r\nmore majestic, and richer in the display of organic forms; but\r\nafter having traversed the banks of the Orinoco, the Cordilleras of\r\nPeru, and the most beautiful valleys of Mexico, I own that I have\r\nnever beheld a prospect more varied, more attractive, more\r\nharmonious in the distribution of the masses of verdure and of\r\nrocks, than the western coast of Teneriffe.\r\n\r\nThe sea-coast is lined with date and cocoa trees. Groups of the\r\nmusa, as the country rises, form a pleasing contrast with the\r\ndragon-tree, the trunks of which have been justly compared to the\r\ntortuous form of the serpent. The declivities are covered with\r\nvines, which throw their branches over towering poles. Orange trees\r\nloaded with flowers, myrtles, and cypress trees encircle the\r\nchapels reared to devotion on the isolated hills. The divisions of\r\nlanded property are marked by hedges formed of the agave and the\r\ncactus. An innumerable quantity of cryptogamous plants, among which\r\nferns are the most predominant, cover the walls, and are moistened\r\nby small springs of limpid water. In winter, when the volcano is\r\nburied under ice and snow, this district enjoys perpetual spring.\r\nIn summer, as the day declines, the breezes from the sea diffuse a\r\ndelicious freshness. The population of this coast is very\r\nconsiderable; and it appears to be still greater than it is,\r\nbecause the houses and gardens are distant from each other, which\r\nadds to the picturesque beauty of the scene. Unhappily the real\r\nwelfare of the inhabitants does not correspond with the exertions\r\nof their industry, or with the advantages which nature has lavished\r\non this spot. The farmers are not land-owners; the fruits of their\r\nlabour belong to the nobles; and those feudal institutions, which,\r\nfor so long a time, spread misery throughout Europe, still press\r\nheavily on the people of the Canary Islands.\r\n\r\nFrom Tegueste and Tacoronte to the village of St. Juan de la Rambla\r\n(which is celebrated for its excellent malmsey wine), the rising\r\nhills are cultivated like a garden. I might compare them to the\r\nenvirons of Capua and Valentia, if the western part of Teneriffe\r\nwas not infinitely more beautiful on account of the proximity of\r\nthe peak, which presents on every side a new point of view. The\r\naspect of this mountain is interesting not merely from its gigantic\r\nmass; it excites the mind, by carrying it back to the mysterious\r\nsource of its volcanic agency. For thousands of years, no flames or\r\nlight have been perceived on the summit of the Piton, nevertheless\r\nenormous lateral eruptions, the last of which took place in 1798,\r\nare proofs of the activity of a fire still far from being\r\nextinguished. There is also something that leaves a melancholy\r\nimpression on beholding a crater in the centre of a fertile and\r\nwell cultivated country. The history of the globe informs us, that\r\nvolcanoes destroy what they have been a long series of ages in\r\ncreating. Islands, which the action of submarine fires has raised\r\nabove the waters, are by degrees clothed in rich and smiling\r\nverdure; but these new lands are often laid waste by the renewed\r\naction of the same power which caused them to emerge from the\r\nbottom of the ocean. Islets, which are now but heaps of scoriae and\r\nvolcanic ashes, were once perhaps as fertile as the hills of\r\nTacoronte and Sauzal. Happy the country, where man has no distrust\r\nof the soil on which he lives!\r\n\r\nPursuing our course to the port of Orotava, we passed the smiling\r\nhamlets of Matanza and Victoria. These names are mingled together\r\nin all the Spanish colonies, and they form an unpleasing contrast\r\nwith the peaceful and tranquil feelings which those countries\r\ninspire. Matanza signifies slaughter, or carnage; and the word\r\nalone recalls the price at which victory has been purchased. In the\r\nNew World it generally indicates the defeat of the natives: at\r\nTeneriffe, the village of Matanza was built in a place* (* The\r\nancient Acantejo.) where the Spaniards were conquered by those same\r\nGuanches who soon after were sold as slaves in the markets of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nBefore we reached Orotava, we visited a botanic garden at a little\r\ndistance from the port. We there found M. Le Gros, the French\r\nvice-consul, who had often scaled the summit of the Peak, and who\r\nserved us as an excellent guide. He was accompanying captain Baudin\r\nin a voyage to the West Indies, when a dreadful tempest, of which\r\nM. Le Dru has given an account in the narrative of his voyage to\r\nPorto Rico, forced the vessel to put into Teneriffe. There M. Le\r\nGros was led by the beauty of the spot to settle. It was he who\r\naugmented scientific knowledge by the first accurate ideas of the\r\ngreat lateral eruption of the Peak, which has been very improperly\r\ncalled the explosion of the volcano of Chahorra. This eruption took\r\nplace on the 8th of June, 1798.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of a botanical garden at Teneriffe is a very\r\nhappy idea, on account of the influence it is likely to have on the\r\nprogress of botany, and on the introduction of useful plants into\r\nEurope. For the first conception of it we are indebted to the\r\nMarquis de Nava. He undertook, at an enormous expense, to level the\r\nhill of Durasno, which rises as an amphitheatre, and which was\r\nbegun to be planted in 1795. The marquis thought that the Canary\r\nIslands, from the mildness of their climate and geographical\r\nposition, were the most suitable place for naturalising the\r\nproductions of the East and West Indies, and for inuring the plants\r\ngradually to the colder temperature of the south of Europe. The\r\nplants of Asia, Africa, and South America, may easily be brought to\r\nOrotava; and in order to introduce the bark-tree* into Sicily,\r\nPortugal, or Grenada, it should be first planted at Durasno, or at\r\nLaguna, and the shoots of this tree may afterwards be transported\r\ninto Europe from the Canaries. (* I speak of the species of\r\nbark-tree (cinchona), which at Peru, and in the kingdom of New\r\nGranada, flourish on the back of the Cordilleras, at the height of\r\nbetween 1000 and 1500 toises, in places where the thermometer is\r\nbetween nine and ten degrees during the day, and from three to four\r\nduring the night. The orange bark-tree (Cinchona lancifolia) is\r\nmuch less delicate than the red bark-tree (C. oblongifolia).) In\r\nhappier times, when maritime wars shall no longer interrupt\r\ncommunication, the garden of Teneriffe may become extremely useful\r\nwith respect to the great number of plants which are sent from the\r\nIndies to Europe; for ere they reach our coasts, they often perish,\r\nowing to the length of the passage, during which they inhale an air\r\nimpregnated with salt water. These plants would meet at Orotava\r\nwith the care and climate necessary for their preservation. At\r\nDurasno, the protea, the psidium, the jambos, the chirimoya of\r\nPeru,* (* Annona cherimolia. Lamarck.) the sensitive plant, and the\r\nheliconia, grow in the open air. We gathered the ripened seeds of\r\nseveral beautiful species of glycine from New Holland, which the\r\ngovernor of Cumana, Mr. Emparan, had successfully cultivated, and\r\nwhich grow wild on the coasts of South America.\r\n\r\nWe arrived very late at the port of Orotava,* (* Puerto de la Cruz.\r\nThe only fine port of the Canary Islands is that of St. Sebastian,\r\nin the isle of Gomara.) if we may give the name of port to a road\r\nin which vessels are obliged to put to sea whenever the winds blow\r\nviolently from the north-west. It is impossible to speak of Orotava\r\nwithout recalling to the remembrance of the friends of science the\r\nname of Don Bernardo Cologan, whose house at all times was open to\r\ntravellers of every nation.\r\n\r\nWe could have wished to have sojourned for some time in Don\r\nBernardo's house, and to have visited with him the charming scenery\r\nof St. Juan de la Rambla and of Rialexo de Abaxo.* (* This\r\nlast-named village stands at the foot of the lofty mountain of\r\nTygayga.) But on a voyage such as we had undertaken, the present is\r\nbut little enjoyed. Continually haunted by the fear of not\r\nexecuting the designs of the morrow, we live in perpetual\r\nuneasiness. Persons who are passionately fond of nature and the\r\narts feel the same sensations, when they travel through Switzerland\r\nand Italy. Enabled to see but a small portion of the objects which\r\nallure them, they are disturbed in their enjoyments by the\r\nrestraints they impose on themselves at every step.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 21st of June, we were on our way to the\r\nsummit of the volcano. M. Le Gros, whose attentions were unwearied,\r\nM. Lalande, secretary to the French Consulate at Santa Cruz, and\r\nthe English gardener at Durasno, joined us on this excursion. The\r\nday was not very fine, and the summit of the peak, which is\r\ngenerally visible at Orotava from sunrise till ten o'clock, was\r\ncovered with thick clouds.\r\n\r\nWe were agreeably surprised by the contrast between the vegetation\r\nof this part of Teneriffe, and that of the environs of Santa Cruz.\r\nUnder the influence of a cool and humid climate, the ground was\r\ncovered with beautiful verdure; while on the road from Santa Cruz\r\nto Laguna the plants exhibited nothing but capsules emptied of\r\ntheir seeds. Near the port of Santa Cruz, the strength of the\r\nvegetation is an obstacle to geological research. We passed along\r\nthe base of two small hills, which rise in the form of bells.\r\nObservations made at Vesuvius and in Auvergne lead us to think that\r\nthese hills owe their origin to lateral eruptions of the great\r\nvolcano. The hill called Montanita de la Villa seems indeed to have\r\nemitted lavas; and according to the tradition of the Guanches, an\r\neruption took place in 1430. Colonel Franqui assured Borda, that\r\nthe place is still to be seen whence the melted matter issued; and\r\nthat the ashes which covered the ground adjacent, were not yet\r\nfertilized. Whenever the rock appeared, we discovered basaltic\r\namygdaloid* (* Basaltartiger Mandelstein. Werner.) covered with\r\nhardened clay,* (* Bimstein-Conglomerat. W.) which contains\r\nrapilli, or fragments of pumice-stone. This last formation\r\nresembles the tufas of Pausilippo, and the strata of puzzolana,\r\nwhich I found in the valley of Quito, at the foot of the volcano of\r\nPichincha. The amygdaloid has very long pores, like the superior\r\nstrata of the lavas of Vesuvius, arising probably from the action\r\nof an elastic fluid forcing its way through the matter in fusion.\r\nNotwithstanding these analogies, I must here repeat, that in all\r\nthe low region of the peak of Teneriffe, on the side of Orotava, I\r\nhave met with no flow of lava, nor any current, the limits of which\r\nare strongly marked. Torrents and inundations change the surface of\r\nthe globe, and when a great number of currents of lava meet and\r\nspread over a plain, as I have seen at Vesuvius, in the Atrio dei\r\nCavalli, they seem to be confounded together, and wear the\r\nappearance of real strata.\r\n\r\nThe villa de Orotava has a pleasant aspect at a distance, from the\r\ngreat abundance of water which runs through the principal streets.\r\nThe spring of Agua Mansa, collected in two large reservoirs, turns\r\nseveral mills, and is afterward discharged among the vineyards of\r\nthe adjacent hills. The climate is still more refreshing at the\r\nvilla than at the port of La Cruz, from the influence of the\r\nbreeze, which blows strong after ten in the morning. The water,\r\nwhich has been dissolved in the air at a higher temperature,\r\nfrequently precipitates itself; and renders the climate very foggy.\r\nThe villa is nearly 160 toises (312 metres) above the level of the\r\nsea, consequently 200 toises lower than the site on which Laguna is\r\nbuilt: it is observed also, that the same kind of plants flower a\r\nmonth later in this latter place.\r\n\r\nOrotava, the ancient Taoro of the Guanches, is situated on a very\r\nsteep declivity. The streets seem deserted; the houses are solidly\r\nbuilt, and of a gloomy appearance. We passed along a lofty\r\naqueduct, lined with a great number of fine ferns; and visited\r\nseveral gardens, in which the fruit trees of the north of Europe\r\nare mingled with orange trees, pomegranate, and date trees. We were\r\nassured, that these last were as little productive here as on the\r\ncoast of Cumana. Although we had been made acquainted, from the\r\nnarratives of many travellers, with the dragon-tree of the garden\r\nof M. Franqui, we were not the less struck with its enormous\r\nmagnitude. We were told, that the trunk of this tree, which is\r\nmentioned in several very ancient documents as marking the\r\nboundaries of a field, was as gigantic in the fifteenth century as\r\nit is at the present time. Its height appeared to us to be about 50\r\nor 60 feet; its circumference near the roots is 45 feet. We could\r\nnot measure higher, but Sir George Staunton found that, 10 feet\r\nfrom the ground, the diameter of the trunk is still 12 English\r\nfeet; which corresponds perfectly with the statement of Borda, who\r\nfound its mean circumference 33 feet 8 inches, French measure. The\r\ntrunk is divided into a great number of branches, which rise in the\r\nform of a candelabrum, and are terminated by tufts of leaves, like\r\nthe yucca which adorns the valley of Mexico. This division gives it\r\na very different appearance from that of the palm-tree.\r\n\r\nAmong organic creations, this tree is undoubtedly, together with\r\nthe Adansonia or baobab of Senegal, one of the oldest inhabitants\r\nof our globe. The baobabs are of still greater dimensions than the\r\ndragon-tree of Orotava. There are some which near the root measure\r\n34 feet in diameter, though their total height is only from 50 to\r\n60 feet. But we should observe, that the Adansonia, like the\r\nochroma, and all the plants of the family of bombax, grow much more\r\nrapidly* than the dracaena, the vegetation of which is very slow.\r\n(* It is the same with the plane-tree (Platanus occidentalis) which\r\nM. Michaux measured at Marietta, on the banks of the Ohio, and\r\nwhich, at twenty feet from the ground, was 15.7 feet in diameter.\r\n--\"Voyage a l'Ouest des Monts Alleghany\" 1804 page 93. The yew,\r\nchestnut, oak, plane-tree, deciduous cypress, bombax, mimosa,\r\ncaesalpina, hymenaea, and dracaena, appear to me to be the plants\r\nwhich, in different climates, present specimens of the most\r\nextraordinary growth. An oak, discovered together with some Gallic\r\nhelmets in 1809, in the turf pits of the department of the Somme,\r\nnear the village of Yseux, seven leagues from Abbeville, was about\r\nthe same size as the dragon-tree of Orotava. According to a memoir\r\nby M. Traullee, the trunk of this oak was 14 feet in diameter.)\r\nThat in M. Franqui's garden still bears every year both flowers and\r\nfruit. Its aspect forcibly exemplifies \"that eternal youth of\r\nnature,\" which is an inexhaustible source of motion and of life.\r\n\r\nThe dracaena, which is seen only in cultivated spots in the Canary\r\nIslands, at Madeira, and Porto Santo, presents a curious phenomenon\r\nwith respect to the migration of plants. It has never been found in\r\na wild state on the continent of Africa. The East Indies is its\r\nreal country. How has this tree been transplanted to Teneriffe,\r\nwhere it is by no means common? Does its existence prove, that, at\r\nsome very distant period, the Guanches had connexions with other\r\nnations originally from Asia?* (* The form of the dragon-tree is\r\nexhibited in several species of the genus Dracaena, at the Cape of\r\nGood Hope, in China, and in New Zealand. But in New Zealand it is\r\nsuperseded by the form of the yucca; for the Dracaena borealis of\r\nAiton is a Convallaria, of which it has all the appearance. The\r\nastringent juice, known in commerce by the name of dragon's blood,\r\nis, according to the inquiries we made on the spot, the produce of\r\nseveral American plants, which do not belong to the same genus and\r\nof which some are lianas. At Laguna, toothpicks steeped in the\r\njuice of the dragon-tree are made in the nunneries, and are much\r\nextolled as highly useful for keeping the gums in a healthy state.)\r\n\r\nOn leaving Orotava, a narrow and stony pathway led us through a\r\nbeautiful forest of chestnut trees (el monte de Castanos), to a\r\nsite covered with brambles, some species of laurels, and\r\narborescent heaths. The trunks of the latter grow to an\r\nextraordinary size; and the flowers with which they are loaded form\r\nan agreeable contrast, during a great part of the year, to the\r\nHypericum canariense, which is very abundant at this height. We\r\nstopped to take in our provision of water under a solitary\r\nfir-tree. This station is known in the country by the name of Pino\r\ndel Dornajito. Its height, according to the barometrical\r\nmeasurement of M. de Borda, is 522 toises; and it commands a\r\nmagnificent prospect of the sea, and the whole of the northern part\r\nof the island. Near Pino del Dornajito, a little on the right of\r\nthe pathway, is a copious spring of water, into which we plunged\r\nthe thermometer, which fell to 15.4 degrees. At a hundred toises\r\ndistance from this spring is another equally limpid. If we admit\r\nthat these waters indicate nearly the mean heat of the place whence\r\nthey issue, we may fix the absolute elevation of the station at 520\r\ntoises, supposing the mean temperature of the coast to be 21\r\ndegrees, and allowing one degree for the decrement of caloric\r\ncorresponding under this zone to 93 toises. We should not be\r\nsurprised if this spring remained a little below the heat of the\r\nair, since it probably takes its source in some more elevated part\r\nof the peak, and possibly communicates with the small subterranean\r\nglaciers of which we shall speak hereafter. The accordance just\r\nobserved between the barometrical and thermometrical measures is so\r\nmuch more striking, because in mountainous countries, with steep\r\ndeclivities, the springs generally indicate too great a decrement\r\nof caloric, for they unite small currents of water, which filtrate\r\nat different heights, and their temperature is consequently the\r\nmean between the temperature of these currents. The spring of\r\nDornajito has considerable reputation in the country; and at the\r\ntime I was there, it was the only one known on the road which leads\r\nto the summit of the volcano. The formation of springs demands a\r\ncertain regularity in the direction and inclination of the strata.\r\nOn a volcanic soil, porous and splintered rocks absorb the rain\r\nwaters, and convey them to considerable depths. Hence arises that\r\naridity observed in the greater part of the Canary Islands,\r\nnotwithstanding the considerable height of their mountains, and the\r\nmass of clouds which navigators behold incessantly overhanging this\r\narchipelago.\r\n\r\nFrom Pino del Dornajito to the crater of the volcano we continued\r\nto ascend without crossing a single valley; for the small ravines\r\n(barancos) do not merit this name. To the eye of the geologist the\r\nwhole island of Teneriffe is but one mountain, the almost\r\nelliptical base of which is prolonged to the north-east, and in\r\nwhich may be distinguished several systems of volcanic rocks formed\r\nat different epochs. The Chahorra, or Montana Colorada, and the\r\nUrca, considered in the country as insulated volcanoes, are only\r\nlittle hills abutting on the peak, and masking its pyramidal form.\r\nThe great volcano, the lateral eruptions of which have given birth\r\nto vast promontories, is not however precisely in the centre of the\r\nisland, and this peculiarity of structure appears the less\r\nsurprising, if we recollect that, as the learned mineralogist M.\r\nCordier has observed, it is not perhaps the small crater of the\r\nPiton which has been the principal agent in the changes undergone\r\nby the island of Teneriffe.\r\n\r\nAbove the region of arborescent heaths, called Monte Verde, is the\r\nregion of ferns. Nowhere, in the temperate zone, have I seen such\r\nan abundance of the pteris, blechnum, and asplenium; yet none of\r\nthese plants have the stateliness of the arborescent ferns which,\r\nat the height of five or six hundred toises, form the principal\r\nornament of equinoctial America. The root of the Pteris aquilina\r\nserves the inhabitants of Palma and Gomera for food; they grind it\r\nto powder, and mix with it a quantity of barley-meal. This\r\ncomposition, when boiled, is called gofio; the use of so homely an\r\naliment is a proof of the extreme poverty of the lower order of\r\npeople in the Canary Islands.\r\n\r\nMonte Verde is intersected by several small and very arid ravines\r\n(canadas), and the region of ferns is succeeded by a wood of\r\njuniper trees and firs, which has suffered greatly from the\r\nviolence of hurricanes. In this place, mentioned by some travellers\r\nunder the name of Caravela,* (* \"Philosophical Transactions\" volume\r\n29 page 317. Carabela is the name of a vessel with lateen sails.\r\nThe pines of the peak formerly were used as masts of vessels.) Mr.\r\nEden states that in the year 1705 he saw little flames, which,\r\naccording to the doctrine of the naturalists of his time, he\r\nattributes to sulphurous exhalations igniting spontaneously. We\r\ncontinued to ascend, till we came to the rock of La Gayta and to\r\nPortillo: traversing this narrow pass between two basaltic hills,\r\nwe entered the great plain of Spartium. At the time of the voyage\r\nof Laperouse, M. Manneron had taken the levels of the peak, from\r\nthe port of Orotava to this elevated plain, near 1400 toises above\r\nthe level of the sea; but the want of water, and the misconduct of\r\nthe guides, prevented him from taking the levels to the top of the\r\nvolcano. The results of the operation, (which was two-thirds\r\ncompleted,) unfortunately were not sent to Europe, and the work is\r\nstill to be recommenced from the sea-coast.\r\n\r\nWe spent two hours and a half in crossing the Llano del Retama,\r\nwhich appears like an immense sea of sand. Notwithstanding the\r\nelevation of this site, the centigrade thermometer rose in the\r\nshade toward sunset, to 13.8 degrees, or 3.7 degrees higher than\r\ntoward noon at Monte Verde. This augmentation of heat could be\r\nattributed only to the reverberation from the ground, and the\r\nextent of the plain. We suffered much from the suffocating dust of\r\nthe pumice-stone, in which we were continually enveloped. In the\r\nmidst of this plain are tufts of the retama, which is the Spartium\r\nnubigenum of Aiton. M. de Martiniere, one of the botanists who\r\nperished in the expedition of Laperouse, wished to introduce this\r\nbeautiful shrub into Languedoc, where firewood is very scarce. It\r\ngrows to the height of nine feet, and is loaded with odoriferous\r\nflowers, with which the goat hunters, that we met in our road, had\r\ndecorated their hats. The goats of the peak, which are of a deep\r\nbrown colour, are reckoned delicious food; they browse on the\r\nspartium, and have run wild in the deserts from time immemorial.\r\nThey have been transported to Madeira, where they are preferred to\r\nthe goats of Europe.\r\n\r\nAs far as the rock of Gayta, or the entrance of the extensive Llano\r\ndel Retama, the peak of Teneriffe is covered with beautiful\r\nvegetation. There are no traces of recent devastation. We might\r\nhave imagined ourselves scaling the side of some volcano, the fire\r\nof which had been extinguished as remotely as that of Monte Cavo,\r\nnear Rome; but scarcely had we reached the plain covered with\r\npumice-stone, when the landscape changed its aspect, and at every\r\nstep we met with large blocks of obsidian thrown out by the\r\nvolcano. Everything here speaks perfect solitude. A few goats and\r\nrabbits only bound across the plain. The barren region of the peak\r\nis nine square leagues; and as the lower regions viewed from this\r\npoint retrograde in the distance, the island appears an immense\r\nheap of torrefied matter, hemmed round by a scanty border of\r\nvegetation.\r\n\r\nFrom the region of the Spartium nubigenum we passed through narrow\r\ndefiles, and small ravines hollowed at a very remote time by the\r\ntorrents, first arriving at a more elevated plain (el Monton de\r\nTrigo), then at the place where we intended to pass the night. This\r\nstation, which is more than 1530 toises above the coast, bears the\r\nname of the English Halt (Estancia de los Ingleses* (* This\r\ndenomination was in use as early as the beginning of the last\r\ncentury. Mr. Eden, who corrupts all Spanish words, as do most\r\ntravellers in our own times, calls it the Stancha: it is the\r\nStation des Rochers of M. Borda, as is proved by the barometrical\r\nheights there observed. These heights were in 1803, according to M.\r\nCordier, 19 inches 9.5 lines; and in 1776, according to Messrs.\r\nBorda and Varela, 19 inches 9.8 lines; the barometer at Orotava\r\nkeeping within nearly a line at the same height.)), no doubt\r\nbecause most of the travellers, who formerly visited the peak, were\r\nEnglishmen. Two inclined rocks form a kind of cavern, which affords\r\na shelter from the winds. This point, which is higher than the\r\nsummit of the Canigou, can be reached on the backs of mules; and\r\nhere has ended the expedition of numbers of travellers, who on\r\nleaving Orotava hoped to have ascended to the brink of the crater.\r\nThough in the midst of summer, and under an African sky, we\r\nsuffered from cold during the night. The thermometer descended as\r\nlow as to five degrees. Our guides made a large fire with the dry\r\nbranches of retama. Having neither tents nor cloaks, we lay down on\r\nsome masses of rock, and were singularly incommoded by the flame\r\nand smoke, which the wind drove towards us. We had attempted to\r\nform a kind of screen with cloths tied together, but our enclosure\r\ntook fire, which we did not perceive till the greater part had been\r\nconsumed by the flames. We had never passed a night on a point so\r\nelevated, and we then little imagined that we should, one day, on\r\nthe ridge of the Cordilleras, inhabit towns higher than the summit\r\nof the volcano we were to scale on the morrow. As the temperature\r\ndiminished, the peak became covered with thick clouds. The approach\r\nof night interrupts the play of the ascending current, which,\r\nduring the day, rises from the plains towards the high regions of\r\nthe atmosphere; and the air, in cooling, loses its capacity of\r\nsuspending water. A strong northerly wind chased the clouds; the\r\nmoon at intervals, shooting through the vapours, exposed its disk\r\non a firmament of the darkest blue; and the view of the volcano\r\nthrew a majestic character over the nocturnal scenery. Sometimes\r\nthe peak was entirely hidden from our eyes by the fog, at other\r\ntimes it broke upon us in terrific proximity; and, like an enormous\r\npyramid, threw its shadow over the clouds rolling beneath our feet.\r\n\r\nAbout three in the morning, by the sombrous light of a few fir\r\ntorches, we started on our journey to the summit of the Piton. We\r\nscaled the volcano on the north-east side, where the declivities\r\nare extremely steep; and after two hours' toil, we reached a small\r\nplain, which, on account of its elevated position, bears the name\r\nof Alta Vista. This is the station of the neveros, those natives,\r\nwhose occupation it is to collect ice and snow, which they sell in\r\nthe neighbouring towns. Their mules, better practised in climbing\r\nmountains than those hired by travellers, reach Alta Vista, and the\r\nneveros are obliged to transport the snow to that place on their\r\nbacks. Above this point commences the Malpays, a term by which is\r\ndesignated here, as well as in Mexico, Peru, and every other\r\ncountry subject to volcanoes, a ground destitute of vegetable\r\nmould, and covered with fragments of lava.\r\n\r\nWe turned to the right to examine the cavern of ice, which is at\r\nthe elevation of 1728 toises, consequently below the limit of the\r\nperpetual snows in this zone. Probably the cold which prevails in\r\nthis cavern, is owing to the same causes which perpetuate the ice\r\nin the crevices of Mount Jura and the Apennines, and on which the\r\nopinions of naturalists are still much divided. This natural\r\nice-house of the peak has, nevertheless, none of those\r\nperpendicular openings, which give emission to the warm air, while\r\nthe cold air remains undisturbed at the bottom. It would seem that\r\nthe ice is preserved in it on account of its mass, and because its\r\nmelting is retarded by the cold, which is the consequence of quick\r\nevaporation. This small subterraneous glacier is situated in a\r\nregion, the mean temperature of which is probably not under three\r\ndegrees; and it is not, like the true glaciers of the Alps, fed by\r\nthe snow waters that flow from the summits of the mountains. During\r\nwinter the cavern is filled with ice and snow; and as the rays of\r\nthe sun do not penetrate beyond the mouth, the heats of summer are\r\nnot sufficient to empty the reservoir. The existence of a natural\r\nice-house depends, consequently, rather on the quantity of snow\r\nwhich enters it in winter, and the small influence of the warm\r\nwinds in summer, than on the absolute elevation of the cavity, and\r\nthe mean temperature of the layer of air in which it is situated.\r\nThe air contained in the interior of a mountain is not easily\r\ndisplaced, as is exemplified by Monte Testaccio at Rome, the\r\ntemperature of which is so different from that of the surrounding\r\natmosphere. On Chimborazo enormous heaps of ice are found covered\r\nwith sand, and, in the same manner as at the peak, far below the\r\ninferior limit of the perpetual snows.\r\n\r\nIt was near the Ice-Cavern (Cueva del Hielo), that, in the voyage\r\nof Laperouse, Messrs. Lamanon and Monges made their experiments on\r\nthe temperature of boiling water. These naturalists found it 88.7\r\ndegrees, the barometer at nineteen inches one line. In the kingdom\r\nof New Grenada, at the chapel of Guadaloupe, near Santa-Fe de\r\nBogota, I have seen water boil at 89.9 degrees, under a pressure of\r\n19 inches 1.9 lines, At Tambores, in the province of Popayan, Senor\r\nCaldas found the heat of boiling water 89.5 degrees, the barometer\r\nbeing at 18 inches 11.6 lines. These results might lead us to\r\nsuspect, that, in the experiment of M. Lamanon, the water had not\r\nreached the maximum of its temperature.\r\n\r\nDay was beginning to dawn when we left the ice-cavern. We observed,\r\nduring the twilight, a phenomenon which is not unusual on high\r\nmountains, but which the position of the volcano we were scaling\r\nrendered very striking. A layer of white and fleecy clouds\r\nconcealed from us the sight of the ocean, and the lower region of\r\nthe island. This layer did not appear above 800 toises high; the\r\nclouds were so uniformly spread, and kept so perfect a level, that\r\nthey wore the appearance of a vast plain covered with snow. The\r\ncolossal pyramid of the peak, the volcanic summits of Lancerota, of\r\nForteventura, and the isle of Palma, were like rocks amidst this\r\nvast sea of vapours, and their black tints were in fine contrast\r\nwith the whiteness of the clouds.\r\n\r\nWhile we were climbing over the broken lavas of the Malpays, we\r\nperceived a very curious optical phenomenon, which lasted eight\r\nminutes. We thought we saw on the east side small rockets thrown\r\ninto the air. Luminous points, about seven or eight degrees above\r\nthe horizon, appeared first to move in a vertical direction; but\r\ntheir motion was gradually changed into a horizontal oscillation.\r\nOur fellow-travellers, our guides even, were astonished at this\r\nphenomenon, without our having made any remark on it to them. We\r\nthought, at first sight, that these luminous points, which floated\r\nin the air, indicated some new eruption of the great volcano of\r\nLancerota; for we recollected that Bouguer and La Condamine, in\r\nscaling the volcano of Pichincha, were witnesses of the eruption of\r\nCotopaxi. But the illusion soon ceased, and we found that the\r\nluminous points were the images of several stars magnified by the\r\nvapours. These images remained motionless at intervals, they then\r\nseemed to rise perpendicularly, descended sideways, and returned to\r\nthe point whence they had departed. This motion lasted one or two\r\nseconds. Though we had no exact means of measuring the extent of\r\nthe lateral shifting, we did not the less distinctly observe the\r\npath of the luminous point. It did not appear double from an effect\r\nof mirage, and left no trace of light behind. Bringing, with the\r\ntelescope of a small sextant by Troughton, the stars into contact\r\nwith the lofty summit of a mountain in Lancerota, I observed that\r\nthe oscillation was constantly directed towards the same point,\r\nthat is to say, towards that part of the horizon where the disk of\r\nthe sun was to appear; and that, making allowance for the motion of\r\nthe star in its declination, the image returned always to the same\r\nplace. These appearances of lateral refraction ceased long before\r\ndaylight rendered the stars quite invisible. I have faithfully\r\nrelated what we saw during the twilight, without undertaking to\r\nexplain this extraordinary phenomenon, of which I published an\r\naccount in Baron Zach's Astronomical Journal, twelve years ago. The\r\nmotion of the vesicular vapours, caused by the rising of the sun;\r\nthe mingling of several layers of air, the temperature and density\r\nof which were very different, no doubt contributed to produce an\r\napparent movement of the stars in the horizontal direction. We see\r\nsomething similar in the strong undulations of the solar disk, when\r\nit cuts the horizon; but these undulations seldom exceed twenty\r\nseconds, while the lateral motion of the stars, observed at the\r\npeak, at more than 1800 toises, was easily distinguished by the\r\nnaked eye, and seemed to exceed all that we have thought it\r\npossible to consider hitherto as the effect of the refraction of\r\nthe light of the stars. On the top of the Andes, at Antisana, I\r\nobserved the sun-rise, and passed the whole night at the height of\r\n2100 toises, without noting any appearance resembling this\r\nphenomenon.\r\n\r\nI was anxious to make an exact observation of the instant of\r\nsun-rising at an elevation so considerable as that we had reached\r\non the peak of Teneriffe. No traveller, furnished with instruments,\r\nhad as yet taken such an observation. I had a telescope and a\r\nchronometer, which I knew to be exceedingly correct. In the part\r\nwhere the sun was to appear the horizon was free from vapour. We\r\nperceived the upper limb at 4 hours 48 minutes 55 seconds apparent\r\ntime, and what is very remarkable, the first luminous point of the\r\ndisk appeared immediately in contact with the limit of the horizon,\r\nconsequently we saw the true horizon; that is to say, a part of the\r\nsea farther distant than 43 leagues. It is proved by calculation\r\nthat, under the same parallel in the plain, the rising would have\r\nbegun at 5 hours 1 minute 50.4 seconds, or 11 minutes 51.3 seconds\r\nlater than at the height of the peak. The difference observed was\r\n12 minutes 55 seconds, which arose no doubt from the uncertainty of\r\nthe refraction for a zenith distance, of which observations are\r\nwanting.\r\n\r\nWe were surprised at the extreme slowness with which the lower limb\r\nof the sun seemed to detach itself from the horizon. This limb was\r\nnot visible till 4 hours 56 minutes 56 seconds. The disc of the\r\nsun, much flattened, was well defined; during the ascent there was\r\nneither double image nor lengthening of the lower limb. The\r\nduration of the sun's rising being triple that which we might have\r\nexpected in this latitude, we must suppose that a fog-bank, very\r\nuniformly extended, concealed the true horizon, and followed the\r\nsun in its ascent. Notwithstanding the libration of the stars,*\r\nwhich we had observed towards the east, we could not attribute the\r\nslowness of the rising to an extraordinary refraction of the rays\r\noccasioned by the horizon of the sea; for it is precisely at the\r\nrising of the sun, as Le Gentil daily observed at Pondicherry, and\r\nas I have several times remarked at Cumana, that the horizon sinks,\r\non account of the elevation of temperature in the stratum of the\r\nair which lies immediately over the surface of the ocean. (* A\r\ncelebrated astronomer, Baron Zach, has compared this phenomenon of\r\nan apparent libration of the stars to that described in the\r\nGeorgics (lib. 50 v. 365). But this passage relates only to the\r\nfalling stars, which the ancients, (like the mariners of modern\r\ntimes) considered as a prognostic of wind.)\r\n\r\nThe road, which we were obliged to clear for ourselves across the\r\nMalpays, was extremely fatiguing. The ascent is steep, and the\r\nblocks of lava rolled from beneath our feet. I can compare this\r\npart of the road only to the Moraine of the Alps or that mass of\r\npebbly stones which we find at the lower extremity of the glaciers.\r\nAt the peak the lava, broken into sharp pieces, leaves hollows, in\r\nwhich we risked falling up to our waists. Unfortunately the\r\nlistlessness of our guides contributed to increase the difficulty\r\nof this ascent. Unlike the guides of the valley of Chamouni, or the\r\nnimble-footed Guanches, who could, it is asserted, seize the rabbit\r\nor wild goat in its course, our Canarian guides were models of the\r\nphlegmatic. They had wished to persuade us on the preceding evening\r\nnot to go beyond the station of the rocks. Every ten minutes they\r\nsat down to rest themselves, and when unobserved they threw away\r\nthe specimens of obsidian and pumice-stone, which we had carefully\r\ncollected. We discovered at length that none of them had ever\r\nvisited the summit of the volcano.\r\n\r\nAfter three hours' walking, we reached, at the extremity of the\r\nMalpays, a small plain, called La Rambleta, from the centre of\r\nwhich the Piton, or Sugar-loaf, takes its rise. On the side toward\r\nOrotava the mountain resembles those pyramids with steps that are\r\nseen at Fayoum and in Mexico; for the elevated plains of Retama and\r\nRambleta form two tiers, the first of which is four times higher\r\nthan the second. If we suppose the total height of the Peak to be\r\n1904 toises, the Rambleta is 1820 toises above the level of the\r\nsea. Here are found those spiracles, which are called by the\r\nnatives the Nostrils of the Peak (Narices del Pico). Watery and\r\nheated vapours issue at intervals from several crevices in the\r\nground, and the thermometer rose to 43.2 degrees. M. Labillardiere\r\nhad found the temperature of these vapours, eight years before us,\r\n53.7 degrees; a difference which does not perhaps prove so much a\r\ndiminution of activity in the volcano, as a local change in the\r\nheating of its internal surface. The vapours have no smell, and\r\nseem to be pure water. A short time before the great eruption of\r\nMount Vesuvius, in 1805, M. Gay-Lussac and myself had observed that\r\nwater, under the form of vapour, in the interior of the crater, did\r\nnot redden paper which had been dipped in syrup of violets. I\r\ncannot, however, admit the bold hypothesis, according to which the\r\nNostrils of the Peak are to be considered as the vents of an\r\nimmense apparatus of distillation, the lower part of which is\r\nsituated below the level of the sea. Since the time when volcanoes\r\nhave been carefully studied, and the love of the marvellous has\r\nbeen less apparent in works on geology, well founded doubts have\r\nbeen raised respecting these direct and constant communications\r\nbetween the waters of the sea and the focus of the volcanic fire.*\r\n(* This question has been examined with much sagacity by M.\r\nBrieslak, in his \"Introduzzione alla Geologia,\" tome 2 pages 302,\r\n323, 347. Cotopaxi and Popocatepetl, which I saw ejecting smoke and\r\nashes, in 1804, are farther from both the Pacific and the Gulf of\r\nthe Antilles, than Grenoble is from the Mediterranean, and Orleans\r\nfrom the Atlantic. We must not consider the fact as merely\r\naccidental, that we have not yet discovered an active volcano more\r\nthan 40 leagues distant from the ocean; but I consider the\r\nhypothesis, that the waters of the sea are absorbed, distilled, and\r\ndecomposed by volcanoes, as very doubtful.) We may find a very\r\nsimple explanation of a phenomenon, that has in it nothing very\r\nsurprising. The peak is covered with snow during part of the year;\r\nwe ourselves found it still so in the plain of Rambleta. Messrs.\r\nO'Donnel and Armstrong discovered in 1806 a very abundant spring in\r\nthe Malpays, a hundred toises above the cavern of ice, which is\r\nperhaps fed partly by this snow. Everything consequently leads us\r\nto presume that the peak of Teneriffe, like the volcanoes of the\r\nAndes, and those of the island of Manilla, contains within itself\r\ngreat cavities, which are filled with atmospherical water, owing\r\nmerely to filtration. The aqueous vapours exhaled by the Narices\r\nand crevices of the crater, are only those same waters heated by\r\nthe interior surfaces down which they flow.\r\n\r\nWe had yet to scale the steepest part of the mountain, the Piton,\r\nwhich forms the summit. The slope of this small cone, covered with\r\nvolcanic ashes, and fragments of pumice-stone, is so steep, that it\r\nwould have been almost impossible to reach the top, had we not\r\nascended by an old current of lava, the debris of which have\r\nresisted the ravages of time. These debris form a wall of scorious\r\nrock, which stretches into the midst of the loose ashes. We\r\nascended the Piton by grasping these half-decomposed scoriae, which\r\noften broke in our hands. We employed nearly half an hour to scale\r\na hill, the perpendicular height of which is scarcely ninety\r\ntoises. Vesuvius, three times lower than the peak of Teneriffe, is\r\nterminated by a cone of ashes almost three times higher, but with a\r\nmore accessible and easy slope. Of all the volcanoes which I have\r\nvisited, that of Jorullo, in Mexico, is the only one that is more\r\ndifficult to climb than the Peak, because the whole mountain is\r\ncovered with loose ashes.\r\n\r\nWhen the Sugar-loaf (el Piton) is covered with snow, as it is in\r\nthe beginning of winter, the steepness of its declivity may be very\r\ndangerous to the traveller. M. Le Gros showed us the place where\r\ncaptain Baudin was nearly killed when he visited the Peak of\r\nTeneriffe. That officer had the courage to undertake, in company\r\nwith the naturalists Advenier, Mauger, and Riedle, an excursion to\r\nthe top of the volcano about the end of December, 1797. Having\r\nreached half the height of the cone, he fell, and rolled down as\r\nfar as the small plain of Rambleta; happily a heap of lava, covered\r\nwith snow, hindered him from rolling farther with accelerated\r\nvelocity. I have been told, that in Switzerland a traveller was\r\nsuffocated by rolling down the declivity of the Col de Balme, over\r\nthe compact turf of the Alps.\r\n\r\nWhen we gained the summit of the Piton, we were surprised to find\r\nscarcely room enough to seat ourselves conveniently. We were\r\nstopped by a small circular wall of porphyritic lava, with a base\r\nof pitchstone, which concealed from us the view of the crater.* (*\r\nCalled La Caldera, or the caldron of the peak, a denomination which\r\nrecalls to mind the Oules of the Pyrenees.) The west wind blew with\r\nsuch violence that we could scarcely stand. It was eight in the\r\nmorning, and we suffered severely from the cold, though the\r\nthermometer kept a little above freezing point. For a long time we\r\nhad been accustomed to a very high temperature, and the dry wind\r\nincreased the feeling of cold, because it carried off every moment\r\nthe small atmosphere of warm and humid air, which was formed around\r\nus from the effect of cutaneous perspiration.\r\n\r\nThe brink of the crater of the peak bears no resemblance to those\r\nof most of the other volcanoes which I have visited: for instance,\r\nthe craters of Vesuvius, Jorullo, and Pichincha. In these the Piton\r\npreserves its conic figure to the very summit: the whole of their\r\ndeclivity is inclined the same number of degrees, and uniformly\r\ncovered with a layer of pumice-stone very minutely divided; when we\r\nreach the top of these volcanoes, nothing obstructs the view of the\r\nbottom of the crater. The peaks of Teneriffe and Cotopaxi, on the\r\ncontrary, are of very different construction. At their summit a\r\ncircular wall surrounds the crater; which wall, at a distance, has\r\nthe appearance of a small cylinder placed on a truncated cone. On\r\nCotopaxi this peculiar construction is visible to the naked eye at\r\nmore than 2000 toises distance; and no person has ever reached the\r\ncrater of that volcano. On the peak of Teneriffe, the wall, which\r\nsurrounds the crater like a parapet, is so high, that it would be\r\nimpossible to reach the Caldera, if, on the eastern side, there was\r\nnot a breach, which seems to have been the effect of a flowing of\r\nvery old lava. We descended through this breach toward the bottom\r\nof the funnel, the figure of which is elliptic. Its greater axis\r\nhas a direction from north-west to south-east, nearly north 35\r\ndegrees west. The greatest breadth of the mouth appeared to us to\r\nbe 300 feet, the smallest 200 feet, which numbers agree very nearly\r\nwith the measurement of MM. Verguin, Varela, and Borda.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to conceive, that the size of a crater does not depend\r\nsolely on the height and mass of the mountain, of which it forms\r\nthe principal air-vent. This opening is indeed seldom in direct\r\nratio with the intensity of the volcanic fire, or with the activity\r\nof the volcano. At Vesuvius, which is but a hill compared with the\r\nPeak of Teneriffe, the diameter of the crater is five times\r\ngreater. When we reflect, that very lofty volcanoes throw out less\r\nmatter from their summits than from lateral openings, we should be\r\nled to think, that the lower the volcanoes, their force and\r\nactivity being the same, the more considerable ought to be their\r\ncraters. In fact, there are immense volcanoes in the Andes, which\r\nhave but very small openings; and we might establish as a\r\ngeological principle, that the most colossal mountains have craters\r\nof little extent at the summits, if the Cordilleras did not present\r\nmany instances to the contrary.* (* The great volcanoes of Cotopaxi\r\nand Rucupichincha have craters, the diameters of which, according\r\nto my measurements, exceed 400 and 700 toises.) I shall have\r\noccasion, in the progress of this work, to cite a number of facts,\r\nwhich will throw some light on what may be called the external\r\nstructure of volcanoes. This structure is as varied as the volcanic\r\nphenomena themselves; and in order to raise ourselves to geological\r\nconceptions worthy of the greatness of nature, we must set aside\r\nthe idea that all volcanoes are formed after the model of Vesuvius,\r\nStromboli, and Etna.\r\n\r\nThe external edges of the Caldera are almost perpendicular. Their\r\nappearance is somewhat like the Somma, seen from the Atrio dei\r\nCavalli. We descended to the bottom of the crater on a train of\r\nbroken lava, from the eastern breach of the enclosure. The heat was\r\nperceptible only in a few crevices, which gave vent to aqueous\r\nvapours with a peculiar buzzing noise. Some of these funnels or\r\ncrevices are on the outside of the enclosure, on the external brink\r\nof the parapet that surrounds the crater. We plunged the\r\nthermometer into them, and saw it rise rapidly to 68 and 75\r\ndegrees. It no doubt indicated a higher temperature, but we could\r\nnot observe the instrument till we had drawn it up, lest we should\r\nburn our hands. M. Cordier found several crevices, the heat of\r\nwhich was that of boiling water. It might be thought that these\r\nvapours, which are emitted in gusts, contain muriatic or sulphurous\r\nacid; but when condensed, they have no particular taste; and\r\nexperiments, which have been made with re-agents, prove that the\r\nchimneys of the peak exhale only pure water. This phenomenon,\r\nanalogous to that which I observed in the crater of Jorullo,\r\ndeserves the more attention, as muriatic acid abounds in the\r\ngreater part of volcanoes, and as M. Vauquelin has discovered it\r\neven in the porphyritic lavas of Sarcouy in Auvergne.\r\n\r\nI sketched on the spot a view of the interior edge of the crater,\r\nas it presented itself in the descent by the eastern break. Nothing\r\nis more striking than the manner in which these strata of lava are\r\npiled on one another, exhibiting the sinuosities of the calcareous\r\nrock of the higher Alps. These enormous ledges, sometimes\r\nhorizontal, sometimes inclined and undulating, are indicative of\r\nthe ancient fluidity of the whole mass, and of the combination of\r\nseveral deranging causes, which have determined the direction of\r\neach flow. The top of the circular wall exhibits those curious\r\nramifications which we find in coke. The northern edge is most\r\nelevated. Towards the south-west the enclosure is considerably sunk\r\nand an enormous mass of scorious lava seems glued to the extremity\r\nof the brink. On the west the rock is perforated; and a large\r\nopening gives a view of the horizon of the sea. The force of the\r\nelastic vapours perhaps formed this natural aperture, at the time\r\nof some inundation of lava thrown out from the crater.\r\n\r\nThe inside of this funnel indicates a volcano, which for thousands\r\nof years has vomited no fire but from its sides. This conclusion is\r\nnot founded on the absence of great openings, which might be\r\nexpected in the bottom of the Caldera. Those whose experience is\r\nfounded on personal observation, know that several volcanoes, in\r\nthe intervals of an eruption, appear filled up, and almost\r\nextinguished; but that in these same mountains, the crater of the\r\nvolcano exhibits layers of scoriae, rough, sonorous, and shining.\r\nWe observe hillocks and intumescences caused by the action of the\r\nelastic vapours, cones of broken scoriae and ashes which cover the\r\nfunnels. None of these phenomena characterise the crater of the\r\npeak of Teneriffe; its bottom is not in the state which ensues at\r\nthe close of an eruption. From the lapse of time, and the action of\r\nthe vapours, the inside walls are detached, and have covered the\r\nbasin with great blocks of lithoid lavas.\r\n\r\nThe bottom of the Caldera is reached without danger. In a volcano,\r\nthe activity of which is principally directed towards the summit,\r\nsuch as Vesuvius, the depth of the crater varies before and after\r\neach eruption; but at the peak of Teneriffe the depth appears to\r\nhave remained unchanged for a long time. Eden, in 1715, estimated\r\nit at 115 feet; Cordier, in 1803, at 110 feet. Judging by mere\r\ninspection, I should have thought the funnel of still less depth.\r\nIts present state is that of a solfatara; and it is rather an\r\nobject of curious investigation, than of imposing aspect. The\r\nmajesty of the site consists in its elevation above the level of\r\nthe sea, in the profound solitude of these lofty regions, and in\r\nthe immense space over which the eye ranges from the summit of the\r\nmountain.\r\n\r\nThe wall of compact lava, forming the enclosure of the Caldera, is\r\nsnow-white at its surface. The same colour prevails in the inside\r\nof the Solfatara of Puzzuoli. When we break these lavas, which\r\nmight be taken at some distance for calcareous stone, we find in\r\nthem a blackish brown nucleus. Porphyry, with basis of pitch-stone,\r\nis whitened externally by the slow action of the vapours of\r\nsulphurous acid gas. These vapours rise in abundance; and what is\r\nrather remarkable, through crevices which seem to have no\r\ncommunication with the apertures that emit aqueous vapours. We may\r\nbe convinced of the presence of the sulphurous acid, by examining\r\nthe fine crystals of sulphur, which are everywhere found in the\r\ncrevices of the lava. This acid, combined with the water with which\r\nthe soil is impregnated, is transformed into sulphuric acid by\r\ncontact with the oxygen of the atmosphere. In general, the humidity\r\nin the crater of the peak is more to be feared than the heat; and\r\nthey who seat themselves for a while on the ground find their\r\nclothes corroded. The porphyritic lavas are affected by the action\r\nof the sulphuric acid: the alumine, magnesia, soda, and metallic\r\noxides gradually disappear; and often nothing remains but the\r\nsilex, which unites in mammillary plates, like opal. These\r\nsiliceous concretions,* (* Opalartiger kieselsinter. The siliceous\r\ngurh of the volcanoes of the Isle of France contains, according to\r\nKlaproth, 0.72 silex, and 0.21 water; and thus comes near to opal,\r\nwhich Karsten considers as a hydrated silex.) which M. Cordier\r\nfirst made known, are similar to those found in the isle of Ischia,\r\nin the extinguished volcanoes of Santa Fiora, and in the Solfatara\r\nof Puzzuoli. It is not easy to form an idea of the origin of these\r\nincrustations. The aqueous vapours, discharged through great\r\nspiracles, do not contain alkali in solution, like the waters of\r\nthe Geyser, in Iceland. Perhaps the soda contained in the lavas of\r\nthe peak acts an important part in the formation of these deposits\r\nof silex. There may exist in the crater small crevices, the vapours\r\nof which are not of the same nature as those on which travellers,\r\nwhose attention has been directed simultaneously to a great number\r\nof objects, have made experiments.\r\n\r\nSeated on the northern brink of the crater, I dug a hole of some\r\ninches in depth; and the thermometer placed in this hole rose\r\nrapidly to 42 degrees. Hence we may conclude what must be the heat\r\nin this solfatara at the depth of thirty or forty fathoms. The\r\nsulphur reduced into vapour is condensed into fine crystals, which\r\nhowever are not equal in size to those M. Dolomieu brought from\r\nSicily. They are semi-diaphanous octahedrons, very brilliant on the\r\nsurface, and of a conchoidal fracture. These masses, which will one\r\nday perhaps be objects of commerce, are constantly bedewed with\r\nsulphurous acid. I had the imprudence to wrap up a few, in order to\r\npreserve them, but I soon discovered that the acid had consumed not\r\nonly the paper which contained them, but a part also of my\r\nmineralogical journal. The heat of the vapours, which issue from\r\nthe crevices of the caldera, is not sufficiently great to combine\r\nthe sulphur while in a state of minute division, with the oxygen of\r\nthe atmospheric air; and after the experiment I have just cited on\r\nthe temperature of the soil, we may presume that the sulphurous\r\nacid is formed at a certain depth,* in cavities to which the\r\nexternal air has free access. (* An observer, in general very\r\naccurate, M. Breislack, asserts that the muriatic acid always\r\npredominates in the vapours of Vesuvius. This assertion is contrary\r\nto what M. Gay-Lussac and myself observed, before the great\r\neruption of 1805, and while the lava was issuing from the crater.\r\nThe smell of the sulphurous acid, so easy to distinguish, was\r\nperceptible at a great distance; and when the volcano threw out\r\nscoriae, the smell was mingled with that of petroleum.)\r\n\r\nThe vapours of heated water, which act on the fragments of lava\r\nscattered about on the caldera, reduce certain parts of it to a\r\nstate of paste. On examining, after I had reached America, those\r\nearthy and friable masses, I found crystals of sulphate of alumine.\r\nMM. Davy and Gay-Lussac have already made the ingenious remark,\r\nthat two bodies highly inflammable, the metals of soda and potash,\r\nhave probably an important part in the action of a volcano; now the\r\npotash necessary to the formation of alum is found not only in\r\nfeldspar, mica, pumice-stone, and augite, but also in obsidian.\r\nThis last substance is very common at Teneriffe, where it forms the\r\nbasis of the tephrinic lava. These analogies between the peak of\r\nTeneriffe and the Solfatara of Puzzuoli, might no doubt be shown to\r\nbe more numerous, if the former were more accessible, and had been\r\nfrequently visited by naturalists.\r\n\r\nAn expedition to the summit of the volcano of Teneriffe is\r\ninteresting, not solely on account of the great number of phenomena\r\nwhich are the objects of scientific research; it has still greater\r\nattractions from the picturesque beauties which it lays open to\r\nthose who are feelingly alive to the majesty of nature. It is a\r\ndifficult task to describe the sensations, which are the more\r\nforcible, inasmuch as they have something undefined, produced by\r\nthe immensity of the space as well as by the vastness, the novelty,\r\nand the multitude of the objects, amidst which we find ourselves\r\ntransported. When a traveller attempts to describe the loftiest\r\nsummits of the globe, the cataracts of the great rivers, the\r\ntortuous valleys of the Andes, he incurs the danger of fatiguing\r\nhis readers by the monotonous expression of his admiration. It\r\nappears to me more conformable to the plan I have proposed to\r\nmyself in this narrative, to indicate the peculiar character that\r\ndistinguishes each zone: we exhibit with more clearness the\r\nphysiognomy of the landscape, in proportion as we endeavour to\r\nsketch its individual features, to compare them with each other,\r\nand to discover by this kind of analysis the sources of the\r\nenjoyments, furnished by the great picture of nature.\r\n\r\nTravellers have learned by experience, that views from the summits\r\nof very lofty mountains are neither so beautiful, picturesque, nor\r\nso varied, as those from heights which do not exceed that of\r\nVesuvius, Righi, and the Puy-de-Dome. Colossal mountains, such as\r\nChimborazo, Antisana, or Mount Rosa, compose so large a mass, that\r\nthe plains covered with rich vegetation are seen only in the\r\nimmensity of distance, and a blue and vapoury tint is uniformly\r\nspread over the landscape. The peak of Teneriffe, from its slender\r\nform and local position, unites the advantages of less lofty\r\nsummits with those peculiar to very great heights. We not only\r\ndiscern from its top a vast expanse of sea, but we perceive also\r\nthe forests of Teneriffe, and the inhabited parts of the coasts, in\r\na proximity calculated to produce the most beautiful contrasts of\r\nform and colour. We might say, that the volcano overwhelms with its\r\nmass the little island which serves as its base, and it shoots up\r\nfrom the bosom of the waters to a height three times loftier than\r\nthe region where the clouds float in summer. If its crater, half\r\nextinguished for ages past, shot forth flakes of fire like that of\r\nStromboli in the Aeolian Islands, the peak of Teneriffe, like a\r\nlighthouse, would serve to guide the mariner in a circuit of more\r\nthan 260 leagues.\r\n\r\nWhen we were seated on the external edge of the crater, we turned\r\nour eyes towards the north-west, where the coasts are studded with\r\nvillages and hamlets. At our feet, masses of vapour, constantly\r\ndrifted by the winds, afforded us the most variable spectacle. A\r\nuniform stratum of clouds, similar to that already described, and\r\nwhich separated us from the lower regions of the island, had been\r\npierced in several places by the effect of the small currents of\r\nair, which the earth, heated by the sun, began to send towards us.\r\nThe port of Orotava, its vessels at anchor, the gardens and the\r\nvineyards encircling the town, shewed themselves through an opening\r\nwhich seemed to enlarge every instant. From the summit of these\r\nsolitary regions our eyes wandered over an inhabited world; we\r\nenjoyed the striking contrast between the bare sides of the peak,\r\nits steep declivities covered with scoriae, its elevated plains\r\ndestitute of vegetation, and the smiling aspect of the cultured\r\ncountry beneath. We beheld the plants divided by zones, as the\r\ntemperature of the atmosphere diminished with the elevation of the\r\nsite. Below the Piton, lichens begin to cover the scorious and\r\nlustrous lava: a violet,* (* Viola cheiranthifolia.) akin to the\r\nViola decumbens, rises on the slope of the volcano at 1740 toises\r\nof height; it takes the lead not only of the other herbaceous\r\nplants, but even of the gramina, which, in the Alps and on the\r\nridge of the Cordilleras, form close neighbourhood with the plants\r\nof the family of the cryptogamia. Tufts of retama, loaded with\r\nflowers, adorn the valleys hollowed out by the torrents, and\r\nencumbered with the effects of the lateral eruptions. Below the\r\nretama, lies the region of ferns, bordered by the tract of the\r\narborescent heaths. Forests of laurel, rhamnus, and arbutus, divide\r\nthe ericas from the rising grounds planted with vines and fruit\r\ntrees. A rich carpet of verdure extends from the plain of spartium,\r\nand the zone of the alpine plants even to the groups of the date\r\ntree and the musa, at the feet of which the ocean appears to roll.\r\nI here pass slightly over the principal features of this botanical\r\nchart, as I shall enter hereafter into some farther details\r\nrespecting the geography of the plants of the island of Teneriffe.*\r\n(* See below.)\r\n\r\nThe seeming proximity, in which, from the summit of the peak, we\r\nbehold the hamlets, the vineyards, and the gardens on the coast, is\r\nincreased by the prodigious transparency of the atmosphere.\r\nNotwithstanding the great distance, we could distinguish not only\r\nthe houses, the sails of the vessels, and the trunks of the trees,\r\nbut we could discern the vivid colouring of the vegetation of the\r\nplains. These phenomena are owing not only to the height of the\r\nsite, but to the peculiar modifications of the air in warm\r\nclimates. In every zone, an object placed on a level with the sea,\r\nand viewed in a horizontal direction, appears less luminous, than\r\nwhen seen from the top of a mountain, where vapours arrive after\r\npassing through strata of air of decreasing density. Differences\r\nequally striking are produced by the influence of climate. The\r\nsurface of a lake or large river is less resplendent, when we see\r\nit at an equal distance, from the top of the higher Alps of\r\nSwitzerland, than when we view it from the summit of the\r\nCordilleras of Peru or of Mexico. In proportion as the air is pure\r\nand serene, the solution of the vapours becomes more complete, and\r\nthe light loses less in its passage. When from the shores of the\r\nPacific we ascend the elevated plain of Quito, or that of Antisana,\r\nwe are struck for some days by the nearness at which we imagine we\r\nsee objects which are actually seven or eight leagues distant. The\r\npeak of Teyde has not the advantage of being situated in the\r\nequinoctial region; but the dryness of the columns of air which\r\nrise perpetually above the neighbouring plains of Africa, and which\r\nthe eastern winds convey with rapidity, gives to the atmosphere of\r\nthe Canary Islands a transparency which not only surpasses that of\r\nthe air of Naples and Sicily, but perhaps exceeds the purity of the\r\nsky of Quito and Peru. This transparency may be regarded as one of\r\nthe chief causes of the beauty of landscape scenery in the torrid\r\nzone; it heightens the splendour of the vegetable colouring, and\r\ncontributes to the magical effect of its harmonies and contrasts.\r\nIf the mass of light, which circulates about objects, fatigues the\r\nexternal senses during a part of the day, the inhabitant of the\r\nsouthern climates has his compensation in moral enjoyment. A lucid\r\nclearness in the conceptions, and a serenity of mind, correspond\r\nwith the transparency of the surrounding atmosphere. We feel these\r\nimpressions without going beyond the boundaries of Europe. I appeal\r\nto travellers who have visited countries rendered famous by the\r\ngreat creations of the imagination and of art,--the favoured climes\r\nof Italy and Greece.\r\n\r\nWe prolonged in vain our stay on the summit of the Peak, awaiting\r\nthe moment when we might enjoy the view of the whole of the\r\narchipelago of the Fortunate Islands:* we, however, descried Palma,\r\nGomera, and the Great Canary, at our feet. (* Of all the small\r\nislands of the Canaries, the Rock of the East is the only one which\r\ncannot be seen, even in fine weather, from the top of the Peak. Its\r\ndistance is 3 degrees 5 minutes, while that of the Salvage is only\r\n2 degrees 1 minute. The island of Madeira, distant 4 degrees 29\r\nminutes, would be visible, if its mountains were more than 3000\r\ntoises high.) The mountains of Lancerota, free from vapours at\r\nsunrise, were soon enveloped in thick clouds. Supposing only an\r\nordinary refraction, the eye takes in, in calm weather, from the\r\nsummit of the volcano, a surface of the globe of 5700 square\r\nleagues, equal to a fourth of the superficies of Spain. The\r\nquestion has often been agitated, whether it be possible to\r\nperceive the coast of Africa from the top of this colossal pyramid;\r\nbut the nearest parts of that coast are still farther from\r\nTeneriffe than 2 degrees 49 minutes, or 56 leagues. The visual ray\r\nof the horizon from the Peak being 1 degree 57 minutes, cape\r\nBojador can be seen only on the supposition of its height being 200\r\ntoises above the level of the ocean. We are ignorant of the height\r\nof the Black Mountains near cape Bojador, as well as of that peak,\r\ncalled by navigators the Penon Grande, farther to the south of this\r\npromontory. If the summit of the volcano of Teneriffe were more\r\naccessible, we should observe without doubt, in certain states of\r\nthe wind, the effects of an extraordinary refraction. On perusing\r\nwhat Spanish and Portuguese authors relate respecting the existence\r\nof the fabulous isle of San Borondon, or Antilia, we find that it\r\nis particularly the humid wind from west-south-west, which produces\r\nin these latitudes the phenomena of the mirage. We shall not\r\nhowever admit with M. Vieyra, \"that the play of the terrestrial\r\nrefractions may render visible to the inhabitants of the Canaries\r\nthe islands of Cape Verd, and even the Apalachian mountains of\r\nAmerica.\"* (* The American fruits, frequently thrown by the sea on\r\nthe coasts of the islands of Ferro and Gomera, were formerly\r\nsupposed to emanate from the plants of the island of San Borondon.\r\nThis island, said to be governed by an archbishop and six bishops,\r\nand which Father Feijoa believed to be the image of the island of\r\nFerro, reflected on a fog-bank, was ceded in the 16th century, by\r\nthe King of Portugal, to Lewis Perdigon, at the time the latter was\r\npreparing to take possession of it by conquest.)\r\n\r\nThe cold we felt on the top of the Peak, was very considerable for\r\nthe season. The centigrade thermometer, at a distance from the\r\nground, and from the apertures that emitted the hot vapours, fell\r\nin the shade to 2.7 degrees. The wind was west, and consequently\r\nopposite to that which brings to Teneriffe, during a great part of\r\nthe year, the warm air that floats above the burning desert of\r\nAfrica. As the temperature of the atmosphere, observed at the port\r\nof Orotava by M. Savagi, was 22.8 degrees, the decrement of caloric\r\nwas one degree every 94 toises. This result perfectly corresponds\r\nwith those obtained by Lamanon and Saussure on the summits of the\r\nPeak and Etna, though in very different seasons. The tall slender\r\nform of these mountains facilitates the means of comparing the\r\ntemperature of two strata of the atmosphere, which are nearly in\r\nthe same perpendicular plane; and in this point of view the\r\nobservations made in an excursion to the volcano of Teneriffe\r\nresemble those of an ascent in a balloon. We must nevertheless\r\nremark, that the ocean, on account of its transparency and\r\nevaporation, reflects less caloric than the plains, into the upper\r\nregions of the air; and also that summits which are surrounded by\r\nthe sea are colder in summer, than mountains which rise from a\r\ncontinent; but this circumstance has very little influence on the\r\ndecrement of atmospherical heat; the temperature of the low regions\r\nbeing equally diminished by the proximity of the ocean.\r\n\r\nIt is not the same with respect to the influence exercised by the\r\ndirection of the wind, and the rapidity of the ascending current;\r\nthe latter sometimes increases in an astonishing manner the\r\ntemperature of the loftiest mountains. I have seen the thermometer\r\nrise, on the slope of the volcano of Antisana, in the kingdom of\r\nQuito, to 19 degrees, when we were 2837 toises high. M.\r\nLabillardiere has seen it, on the edge of the crater of the peak of\r\nTeneriffe, at 18.7 degrees, though he had used every possible\r\nprecaution to avoid the effect of accidental causes.\r\n\r\nOn the summit of the Peak, we beheld with admiration the azure\r\ncolour of the sky. Its intensity at the zenith appeared to\r\ncorrespond to 41 degrees of the cyanometer. We know, by Saussure's\r\nexperiment, that this intensity increases with the rarity of the\r\nair, and that the same instrument marked at the same period 39\r\ndegrees at the priory of Chamouni, and 40 degrees at the top of\r\nMont Blanc. This last mountain is 540 toises higher than the\r\nvolcano of Teneriffe; and if, notwithstanding this difference, the\r\nsky is observed there to be of a less deep blue, we must attribute\r\nthis phenomenon to the dryness of the African air, and the\r\nproximity of the torrid zone.\r\n\r\nWe collected on the brink of the crater, some air which we meant to\r\nanalyse on our voyage to America. The phial remained so well\r\ncorked, that on opening it ten days after, the water rushed in with\r\nimpetuosity. Several experiments, made by means of nitrous gas in\r\nthe narrow tube of Fontana's eudiometer, seemed to prove that the\r\nair of the crater contained 0.09 degrees less oxygen than the air\r\nof the sea; but I have little confidence in this result obtained by\r\nmeans which we now consider as very inexact. The crater of the Peak\r\nhas so little depth, and the air is renewed with so much facility,\r\nthat it is scarcely probable the quantity of azote is greater there\r\nthan on the coasts. We know also, from the experiments of MM.\r\nGay-Lussac and Theodore de Saussure, that in the highest as well as\r\nin the lowest regions of the atmosphere, the air equally contains\r\n0.21 of oxygen.* (* During the stay of M. Gay-Lussac and myself at\r\nthe hospice of Mont Cenis, in March 1805, we collected air in the\r\nmidst of a cloud loaded with electricity. This air, analysed in\r\nVolta's eudiometer, contained no hydrogen, and its purity did not\r\ndiffer 0.002 of oxygen from the air of Paris, which we had carried\r\nwith us in phials hermetically sealed.)\r\n\r\nWe saw on the summit of the Peak no trace of psora, lecidea, or\r\nother cryptogamous plants; no insect fluttered in the air. We found\r\nhowever a few hymenoptera adhering to masses of sulphur moistened\r\nwith sulphurous acid, and lining the mouths of the funnels. These\r\nare bees, which appear to have been attracted by the flowers of the\r\nSpartium nubigenum, and which oblique currents of air had carried\r\nup to these high regions, like the butterflies found by M. Ramond\r\nat the top of Mont Perdu. The butterflies perished from cold, while\r\nthe bees on the Peak were scorched on imprudently approaching the\r\ncrevices where they came in search of warmth.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the heat we felt in our feet on the edge of the\r\ncrater, the cone of ashes remains covered with snow during several\r\nmonths in winter. It is probable, that under the cap of snow\r\nconsiderable hollows are found, like those existing under the\r\nglaciers of Switzerland, the temperature of which is constantly\r\nless elevated than that of the soil on which they repose. The cold\r\nand violent wind, which blew from the time of sunrise, induced us\r\nto seek shelter at the foot of the Piton. Our hands and faces were\r\nnearly frozen, while our boots were burnt by the soil on which we\r\nwalked. We descended in the space of a few minutes the Sugar-loaf\r\nwhich we had scaled with so much toil; and this rapidity was in\r\npart involuntary, for we often rolled down on the ashes. It was\r\nwith regret that we quitted this solitude, this domain where Nature\r\nreigns in all her majesty. We consoled ourselves with the hope of\r\nonce again visiting the Canary Islands, but this, like many other\r\nplans we then formed, has never been executed.\r\n\r\nWe traversed the Malpays but slowly; for the foot finds no sure\r\nfoundation on the loose blocks of lava. Nearer the station of the\r\nrocks, the descent becomes extremely difficult; the compact\r\nshort-swarded turf is so slippery, that we were obliged to incline\r\nour bodies continually backward, in order to avoid falling. In the\r\nsandy plain of Retama, the thermometer rose to 22.5 degrees; and\r\nthis heat seemed to us suffocating in comparison with the cold,\r\nwhich we had suffered from the air on the summit of the volcano. We\r\nwere absolutely without water; our guides, not satisfied with\r\ndrinking clandestinely the little supply of malmsey wine, for which\r\nwe were indebted to Don Cologan's kindness, had broken our water\r\njars. Happily the bottle which contained the air of the crater\r\nescaped unhurt.\r\n\r\nWe at length enjoyed the refreshing breeze in the beautiful region\r\nof the arborescent erica and fern; and we were enveloped in a thick\r\nbed of clouds stationary at six hundred toises above the plain. The\r\nclouds having dispersed, we remarked a phenomenon which afterwards\r\nbecame familiar to us on the declivities of the Cordilleras. Small\r\ncurrents of air chased trains of cloud with unequal velocity, and\r\nin opposite directions: they bore the appearance of streamlets of\r\nwater in rapid motion and flowing in all directions, amidst a great\r\nmass of stagnant water. The causes of this partial motion of the\r\nclouds are probably very various; we may suppose them to arise from\r\nsome impulsion at a great distance; from the slight inequalities of\r\nthe soil, which reflects in a greater or less degree the radiant\r\nheat; from a difference of temperature kept up by some chemical\r\naction; or perhaps from a strong electric charge of the vesicular\r\nvapours.\r\n\r\nAs we approached the town of Orotava, we met great flocks of\r\ncanaries.* (* Fringilla Canaria. La Caille relates, in the\r\nnarrative of his voyage to the Cape, that on Salvage Island these\r\ncanaries are so abundant, that you cannot walk there in a certain\r\nseason without breaking their eggs.) These birds, well known in\r\nEurope, were in general uniformly green. Some, however, had a\r\nyellow tinge on their backs; their note was the same as that of the\r\ntame canary. It is nevertheless remarked, that those which have\r\nbeen taken in the island of the Great Canary, and in the islet of\r\nMonte Clara, near Lancerota, have a louder and at the same time a\r\nmore harmonious song. In every zone, among birds of the same\r\nspecies, each flock has its peculiar note. The yellow canaries are\r\na variety, which has taken birth in Europe; and those we saw in\r\ncages at Orotava and Santa Cruz had been bought at Cadiz, and in\r\nother ports of Spain. But of all the birds of the Canary Islands,\r\nthat which has the most heart-soothing song is unknown in Europe.\r\nIt is the capirote, which no effort has succeeded in taming, so\r\nsacred to his soul is liberty. I have stood listening in admiration\r\nof his soft and melodious warbling, in a garden at Orotava; but I\r\nhave never seen him sufficiently near to ascertain to what family\r\nhe belongs. As to the parrots, which were supposed to have been\r\nseen at the period of captain Cook's abode at Teneriffe, they never\r\nexisted but in the narratives of a few travellers, who have copied\r\nfrom each other. Neither parrots nor monkeys inhabit the Canary\r\nIslands; and though in the New Continent the former migrate as far\r\nas North Carolina, I doubt whether in the Old they have ever been\r\nmet with beyond the 28th degree of north latitude.\r\n\r\nToward the close of day we reached the port of Orotava, where we\r\nreceived the unexpected intelligence that the Pizarro would not set\r\nsail till the 24th or 25th. If we could have calculated on this\r\ndelay, we should either have lengthened our stay on the Peak,* or\r\nhave made an excursion to the volcano of Chahorra. (* As a great\r\nnumber of travellers who land at Santa Cruz, do not undertake the\r\nexcursion to the Peak, because they are ignorant of the time it\r\noccupies, it may be useful to lay down the following data: In\r\nmaking use of mules as far as the Estancia de los Ingleses, it\r\ntakes twenty-one hours from Orotava to arrive at the summit of the\r\nPeak, and return to the port; namely, from Orotava to the Pino del\r\nDornajito three hours; from the Pino to the Station of the Rocks\r\nsix hours; and from this station to the Caldera three hours and a\r\nhalf. I reckon nine hours for the descent. In this calculation I\r\ncount only the time employed in walking, without reckoning that\r\nwhich is necessary for examining the productions of the Peak, or\r\nfor taking rest. Half a day is sufficient for going from Santa Cruz\r\nto Orotava.) We passed the following day in visiting the environs\r\nof Orotava, and enjoying the agreeable company we found at Don\r\nCologan's. We perceived that Teneriffe had attractions not only to\r\nthose who devote themselves to the study of nature: we found at\r\nOrotava several persons possessing a taste for literature and\r\nmusic, and who have transplanted into these distant climes the\r\namenity of European society. In these respects the Canary Islands\r\nhave no great resemblance to the other Spanish colonies, excepting\r\nthe Havannah.\r\n\r\nWe were present on the eve of St. John at a pastoral fete in the\r\ngarden of Mr. Little. This gentleman, who rendered great service to\r\nthe Canarians during the last famine, has cultivated a hill covered\r\nwith volcanic substances. He has formed in this delicious site an\r\nEnglish garden, whence there is a magnificent view of the Peak, of\r\nthe villages along the coast, and the isle of Palma, which is\r\nbounded by the vast expanse of the Atlantic. I cannot compare this\r\nprospect with any, except the views of the bays of Genoa and\r\nNaples; but Orotava is greatly superior to both in the magnitude of\r\nthe masses and in the richness of vegetation. In the beginning of\r\nthe evening the slope of the volcano exhibited on a sudden a most\r\nextraordinary spectacle. The shepherds, in conformity to a custom,\r\nno doubt introduced by the Spaniards, though it dates from the\r\nhighest antiquity, had lighted the fires of St. John. The scattered\r\nmasses of fire and the columns of smoke driven by the wind, formed\r\na fine contrast with the deep verdure of the forests which covered\r\nthe sides of the Peak. Shouts of joy resounding from afar were the\r\nonly sounds that broke the silence of nature in these solitary\r\nregions.\r\n\r\nDon Cologan's family has a country-house nearer the coast than that\r\nI have just mentioned. This house, called La Paz, is connected with\r\na circumstance that rendered it peculiarly interesting to us. M. de\r\nBorda, whose death we deplored, was its inmate during his last\r\nvisit to the Canary Islands. It was in a neighbouring plain that he\r\nmeasured the base, by which he determined the height of the Peak.\r\nIn this geometrical operation the great dracaena of Orotava served\r\nas a mark. Should any well-informed traveller at some future day\r\nundertake a new measurement of the volcano with more exactness, and\r\nby the help of astronomical repeating circles, he ought to measure\r\nthe base, not near Orotava, but near Los Silos, at a place called\r\nBante. According to M. Broussonnet there is no plain near the Peak\r\nof greater extent. In herborizing near La Paz we found a great\r\nquantity of Lichen roccella on the basaltic rocks bathed by the\r\nwaters of the sea. The archil of the Canaries is a very ancient\r\nbranch of commerce; this lichen is however found in less abundance\r\nin the island of Teneriffe than in the desert islands of Salvage,\r\nLa Graciosa, and Alegranza, or even in Canary and Hierro. We left\r\nthe port of Orotava on the 24th of June.\r\n\r\nTo avoid disconnecting the narrative of the excursion to the top of\r\nthe Peak, I have said nothing of the geological observations I made\r\non the structure of this colossal mountain, and on the nature of\r\nthe volcanic rocks of which it is composed. Before we quit the\r\narchipelago of the Canaries, I shall linger for a moment, and bring\r\ninto one point of view some facts relating to the physical aspect\r\nof those countries.\r\n\r\nMineralogists who think that the end of the geology of volcanoes is\r\nthe classification of lavas, the examination of the crystals they\r\ncontain, and their description according to their external\r\ncharacters, are generally very well satisfied when they come back\r\nfrom the mouth of a burning volcano. They return loaded with those\r\nnumerous collections, which are the principal objects of their\r\nresearch. This is not the feeling of those who, without confounding\r\ndescriptive mineralogy (oryctognosy) with geognosy, endeavour to\r\nraise themselves to ideas generally interesting, and seek, in the\r\nstudy of nature, for answers to the following questions:--\r\n\r\nIs the conical mountain of a volcano entirely formed of liquified\r\nmatter heaped together by successive eruptions, or does it contain\r\nin its centre a nucleus of primitive rocks covered with lava, which\r\nare these same rocks altered by fire? What are the affinities which\r\nunite the productions of modern volcanoes with the basalts, the\r\nphonolites, and those porphyries with bases of feldspar, which are\r\nwithout quartz, and which cover the Cordilleras of Peru and Mexico,\r\nas well as the small groups of the Monts Dores, of Cantal, and of\r\nMezen in France? Has the central nucleus of volcanoes been heated\r\nin its primitive position, and raised up, in a softened state, by\r\nthe force of the elastic vapours, before these fluids communicated,\r\nby means of a crater, with the external air? What is the substance,\r\nwhich, for thousands of years, keeps up this combustion, sometimes\r\nso slow, and at other times so active? Does this unknown cause act\r\nat an immense depth; or does this chemical action take place in\r\nsecondary rocks lying on granite?\r\n\r\nThe farther we are from finding a solution of these problems in the\r\nnumerous works hitherto published on Etna and Vesuvius, the greater\r\nis the desire of the traveller to see with his own eyes. He hopes\r\nto be more fortunate than those who have preceded him; he wishes to\r\nform a precise idea of the geological relations which the volcano\r\nand the neighbouring mountains bear to each other: but how often is\r\nhe disappointed, when, on the limits of the primitive soil,\r\nenormous banks of tufa and puzzolana render every observation on\r\nthe position and stratification impossible! We reach the inside of\r\nthe crater with less difficulty than we at first expect; we examine\r\nthe cone from its summit to its base; we are struck with the\r\ndifference in the produce of each eruption, and with the analogy\r\nwhich still exists between the lavas of the same volcano; but,\r\nnotwithstanding the care with which we interrogate nature, and the\r\nnumber of partial observations which present themselves at every\r\nstep, we return from the summit of a burning volcano less satisfied\r\nthan when we were preparing to visit it. It is after we have\r\nstudied them on the spot, that the volcanic phenomena appear still\r\nmore isolated, more variable, more obscure, than we imagine them\r\nwhen consulting the narratives of travellers.\r\n\r\nThese reflections occurred to me on descending from the summit of\r\nthe peak of Teneriffe, the first unextinct volcano I had yet\r\nvisited. They returned anew whenever, in South America, or in\r\nMexico, I had occasion to examine volcanic mountains. When we\r\nreflect how little the labours of mineralogists, and the\r\ndiscoveries in chemistry, have promoted the knowledge of the\r\nphysical geology of mountains, we cannot help being affected with a\r\npainful sentiment; and this is felt still more strongly by those,\r\nwho, studying nature in different climates, are more occupied by\r\nthe problems they have not been able to solve, than with the few\r\nresults they have obtained.\r\n\r\nThe peak of Ayadyrma, or of Echeyde,* (* The word Echeyde, which\r\nsignifies Hell in the language of the Guanches, has been corrupted\r\nby the Europeans into Teyde.) is a conic and isolated mountain,\r\nwhich rises in an islet of very small circumference. Those who do\r\nnot take into consideration the whole surface of the globe,\r\nbelieve, that these three circumstances are common to the greater\r\npart of volcanoes. They cite, in support of their opinion, Etna,\r\nthe peak of the Azores, the Solfatara of Guadaloupe, the\r\nTrois-Salazes of the isle of Bourbon, and the clusters of volcanoes\r\nin the Indian Sea and in the Atlantic. In Europe and in Asia, as\r\nfar as the interior of the latter continent is known, no burning\r\nvolcano is situated in the chains of mountains; all being at a\r\ngreater or less distance from those chains. In the New World, on\r\nthe contrary, (and this fact deserves the greatest attention,) the\r\nvolcanoes the most stupendous for their masses form a part of the\r\nCordilleras themselves. The mountains of mica-slate and gneiss in\r\nPeru and New Grenada immediately touch the volcanic porphyries of\r\nthe provinces of Quito and Pasto. To the south and north of these\r\ncountries, in Chile and in the kingdom of Guatimala, the active\r\nvolcanoes are grouped in rows. They are the continuation, as we may\r\nsay, of the chains of primitive rocks, and if the volcanic fire has\r\nbroken forth in some plain remote from the Cordilleras, as in mount\r\nSangay and Jorullo,* (* Two volcanoes of the Provinces of Quixos\r\nand Mechoacan, the one in the southern, and the other in the\r\nnorthern hemisphere.) we must consider this phenomenon as an\r\nexception to the law, which nature seems to have imposed on these\r\nregions. I may here repeat these geological facts, because this\r\npresumed isolated situation of every volcano has been cited in\r\nopposition to the idea that the peak of Teneriffe, and the other\r\nvolcanic summits of the Canary Islands, are the remains of a\r\nsubmerged chain of mountains. The observations which have been made\r\non the grouping of volcanoes in America, prove that the ancient\r\nstate of things represented in the conjectural map of the Atlantic\r\nby M. Bory de St. Vincent* (* Whether the traditions of the\r\nancients respecting the Atlantis are founded on historical facts,\r\nis a matter totally distinct from the question whether the\r\narchipelago of the Canaries and the adjacent islands are the\r\nvestiges of a chain of mountains, rent and sunk in the sea during\r\none of the great convulsions of our globe. I do not pretend to form\r\nany opinion in favour of the existence of the Atlantis; but I\r\nendeavour to prove, that the Canaries have no more been created by\r\nvolcanoes, than the whole body of the smaller Antilles has been\r\nformed by madrepores.) is by no means contradictory to the\r\nacknowledged laws of nature; and that nothing opposes the\r\nsupposition that the summits of Porto Santo, Madeira, and the\r\nFortunate Islands, may heretofore have formed, either a distinct\r\nrange of primitive mountains, or the western extremity of the chain\r\nof the Atlas.\r\n\r\nThe peak of Teyde forms a pyramidal mass like Etna, Tungurahua, and\r\nPopocatepetl. This physiognomic character is very far from being\r\ncommon to all volcanoes. We have seen some in the southern\r\nhemisphere, which, instead of having the form of a cone or a bell,\r\nare lengthened in one direction, having the ridge sometimes smooth,\r\nand at others bristled with small pointed rocks. This structure is\r\npeculiar to Antisana and Pichincha, two burning mountains of the\r\nprovince of Quito; and the absence of the conic form ought never to\r\nbe considered as a reason excluding the idea of a volcanic origin.\r\nI shall develop, in the progress of this work, some of the\r\nanalogies, which I think I have perceived between the physiognomy\r\nof volcanoes and the antiquity of their rocks. It is sufficient to\r\nstate, generally speaking, that the summits, which are still\r\nsubject to eruptions of the greatest violence, and at the nearest\r\nperiods to each other, are SLENDER PEAKS of a conic form; that the\r\nmountains with LENGTHENED SUMMITS, and rugged with small stony\r\nmasses, are very old volcanoes, and near being extinguished; and\r\nthat rounded tops, in the form of domes, or bells, indicate those\r\nproblematic porphyries, which are supposed to have been heated in\r\ntheir primitive position, penetrated by vapours, and forced up in a\r\nmollified state, without having ever flowed as real lithoidal\r\nlavas. To the first class belong Cotopaxi, the peak of Teneriffe,\r\nand the peak of Orizava in Mexico. In the second may be placed\r\nCargueirazo and Pichincha, in the province of Quito; the volcano of\r\nPuracey, near Popayan; and perhaps also Hecla, in Iceland. In the\r\nthird and last we may rank the majestic figure of Chimborazo, and,\r\n(if it be allowable to place by the side of that colossus a hill of\r\nEurope,) the Great Sarcouy in Auvergne.\r\n\r\nIn order to form a more exact idea of the external structure of\r\nvolcanoes, it is important to compare their perpendicular height\r\nwith their circumference. This, however, cannot be done with any\r\nexactness, unless the mountains are isolated, and rising on a plain\r\nnearly on a level with the sea. In calculating the circumference of\r\nthe peak of Teneriffe in a curve passing through the port of\r\nOrotava, Garachico, Adexe, and Guimar, and setting aside the\r\nprolongations of its base towards the forest of Laguna, and the\r\nnorth-east cape of the island, we find that this extent is more\r\nthan 54,000 toises. The height of the Peak is consequently one\r\ntwenty-eighth of the circumference of its basis. M. von Buch found\r\na thirty-third for Vesuvius; and, which perhaps is less certain, a\r\nthirty-fourth for Etna.* (* Gilbert, Annalen der Physik B. 5 page\r\n455. Vesuvius is 133,000 palmas, or eighteen nautical miles in\r\ncircumference. The horizontal distance from Resina to the crater is\r\n3700 toises. Italian mineralogists have estimated the circumference\r\nof Etna at 840,000 palmas, or 119 miles. With these data, the ratio\r\nof the height to the circumference would be only a seventy-second;\r\nbut I find on tracing a curve through Catania, Palermo, Bronte, and\r\nPiemonte, only 62 miles in circumference, according to the best\r\nmaps. This increases the ratio to a fifty-fourth. Does the basis\r\nfall on the outside of the curve that I assume?) If the slope of\r\nthese three volcanoes were uniform from the summit to the base, the\r\npeak of Teyde would have an inclination of 12 degrees 29 minutes,\r\nVesuvius 12 degrees 41 minutes, and Etna 10 degrees 13 minutes, a\r\nresult which must astonish those who do not reflect on what\r\nconstitutes an average slope. In a very long ascent, slopes of\r\nthree or four degrees alternate with others which are inclined from\r\n25 to 30 degrees; and the latter only strike our imagination, because\r\nwe think all the slopes of mountains more steep than they really are.\r\nI may cite in support of this consideration the example of the\r\nascent from the port of Vera Cruz to the elevated plain of Mexico.\r\nOn the eastern slope of the Cordillera a road has been traced,\r\nwhich for ages has not been frequented except on foot, or on the\r\nbacks of mules. From Encero to the small Indian village of Las\r\nVigas, there are 7500 toises of horizontal distance; and Encero\r\nbeing, according to my barometric measurement, 746 toises lower\r\nthan Las Vigas, the result, for the mean slope, is only an angle of\r\n5 degrees 40 minutes.\r\n\r\nIn the following note will be seen the results of some experiments\r\nI have made on the difficulties arising from the declivities in\r\nmountainous countries.*\r\n\r\n(* In places where there were at the same time slopes covered with\r\ntufted grass and loose sands, I took the following measures:--\r\n\r\n  5 degrees, slope of a very marked inclination. In France the high\r\n    roads must not exceed 4 degrees 46 minutes by law;\r\n 15 degrees, slope extremely steep, and which we cannot descend in a\r\n    carriage;\r\n 37 degrees, slope almost inaccessible on foot, if the ground be\r\n    naked rock, or turf too thick to form steps. The body falls\r\n    backwards when the tibia makes a smaller angle than 53 degrees with\r\n    the sole of the foot;\r\n 42 degrees, the steepest slope that can be climbed on foot in a\r\n    ground that is sandy, or covered with volcanic ashes.\r\n\r\nWhen the slope is 44 degrees, it is almost impossible to scale it,\r\nthough the ground permits the forming of steps by thrusting in the\r\nfoot. The cones of volcanoes have a medium slope from 33 to 40\r\ndegrees. The steepest parts of these cones, either of Vesuvius, the\r\nPeak of Teneriffe, the volcano of Pichincha, or Jorullo, are from\r\n40 to 42 degrees. A slope of 55 degrees is quite inaccessible. If\r\nseen from above it would be estimated at 75 degrees.)\r\n\r\nIsolated volcanoes, in the most distant regions, are very analogous\r\nin their structure. At great elevations all have considerable\r\nplains, in the middle of which arises a cone perfectly circular.\r\nThus at Cotopaxi the plains of Suniguaicu extend beyond the farm of\r\nPansache. The stony summit of Antisana, covered with eternal snow,\r\nforms an islet in the midst of an immense plain, the surface of\r\nwhich is twelve leagues square, while its height exceeds that of\r\nthe peak of Teneriffe by two hundred toises. At Vesuvius, at three\r\nhundred and seventy toises high, the cone detaches itself from the\r\nplain of Atrio dei Cavalli. The peak of Teneriffe presents two of\r\nthese elevated plains, the uppermost of which, at the foot of the\r\nPiton, is as high as Etna, and of very little extent; while the\r\nlowermost, covered with tufts of retama, reaches as far as the\r\nEstancia de los Ingleses. This rises above the level of the sea\r\nalmost as high as the city of Quito, and the summit of Mount\r\nLebanon.\r\n\r\nThe greater the quantity of matter that has issued from the crater\r\nof a mountain, the more elevated is its cone of ashes in proportion\r\nto the perpendicular height of the volcano itself. Nothing is more\r\nstriking, under this point of view, than the difference of\r\nstructure between Vesuvius, the peak of Teneriffe, and Pichincha. I\r\nhave chosen this last volcano in preference, because its summit*\r\nenters scarcely within the limit of the perpetual snows. (* I have\r\nmeasured the summit of Pichincha, that is the small mountain\r\ncovered with ashes above the Llano del Vulcan, to the north of Alto\r\nde Chuquira. This mountain has not, however, the regular form of a\r\ncone. As to Vesuvius, I have indicated the mean height of the\r\nSugar-loaf, on account of the great difference between the two\r\nedges of the crater.) The cone of Cotopaxi, the form of which is\r\nthe most elegant and most regular known, is 540 toises in height;\r\nbut it is impossible to decide whether the whole of this mass is\r\ncovered with ashes.\r\n\r\nTABLE 3: VOLCANOES:\r\n\r\nColumn 1: Name of the volcano.\r\n\r\nColumn 2: Total height in toises.\r\n\r\nColumn 3: Height of the cone covered with ashes.\r\n\r\nColumn 4: Proportion of the cone to the total height.\r\n\r\n  Vesuvius          : 606  : 200 : 1/3.\r\n\r\n  Peak of Teneriffe : 1904 : 84  : 1/22.\r\n\r\n  Pichincha         : 2490 : 240 : 1/10.\r\n\r\nThis table seems to indicate, what we shall have an opportunity of\r\nproving more amply hereafter, that the peak of Teneriffe belongs to\r\nthat group of great volcanoes, which, like Etna and Antisana, have\r\nhad more copious eruptions from their sides than from their\r\nsummits. Thus the crater at the extremity of the Piton, which is\r\ncalled the Caldera, is extremely small. Its diminutive size struck\r\nM. de Borda, and other travellers, who took little interest in\r\ngeological investigations.\r\n\r\nAs to the nature of the rocks which compose the soil of Teneriffe,\r\nwe must first distinguish between productions of the present\r\nvolcano, and the range of basaltic mountains which surround the\r\nPeak, and which do not rise more than five or six hundred toises\r\nabove the level of the ocean. Here, as well as in Italy, Mexico,\r\nand the Cordilleras of Quito, the rocks of trap-formation* are at a\r\ndistance from the recent currents of lava (* The trap-formation\r\nincludes the basalts, green-stone (grunstein), the trappean\r\nporphyries, the phonolites or porphyrschiefer, etc.); everything\r\nshows that these two classes of substances, though they owe their\r\norigin to similar phenomena, date from very different periods. It\r\nis important to geology not to confound the modern currents of\r\nlava, the heaps of basalt, green-stone, and phonolite, dispersed\r\nover the primitive and secondary formations, with those porphyroid\r\nmasses having bases of compact feldspar,* which perhaps have never\r\nbeen perfectly liquified, but which do not less belong to the\r\ndomain of volcanoes. (* These petrosiliceous masses contain\r\nvitreous and often calcined crystals of feldspar, of amphibole, of\r\npyroxene, a little of olivine, but scarcely any quartz. To this\r\nvery ambiguous formation belong the trappean porphyries of\r\nChimborazo and of Riobamba in America, of the Euganean mountains in\r\nItaly, and of the Siebengebirge in Germany; as well as the domites\r\nof the Great-Sarcouy, of Puy-de-Dome, of the Little Cleirsou, and\r\nof one part of the Puy-Chopine in Auvergne.)\r\n\r\nIn the island of Teneriffe, strata of tufa, puzzolana, and clay,\r\nseparate the range of basaltic hills from the currents of recent\r\nlithoid lava, and from the eruptions of the present volcano. In the\r\nsame manner as the eruptions of Epomeo in the island of Ischia, and\r\nthose of Jorullo in Mexico, have taken place in countries covered\r\nwith trappean porphyry, ancient basalt, and volcanic ashes, so the\r\npeak of Teyde has raised itself amidst the wrecks of submarine\r\nvolcanoes. Notwithstanding the difference of composition in the\r\nrecent lavas of the Peak, there is a certain regularity of\r\nposition, which must strike the naturalist least skilled in\r\ngeognosy. The great elevated plain of Retama separates the black,\r\nbasaltic, and earthlike lava, from the vitreous and feldsparry\r\nlava, the basis of which is obsidian, pitch-stone, and phonolite.\r\nThis phenomenon is the more remarkable, inasmuch as in Bohemia and\r\nin other parts of Europe, the porphyrschiefer with base of\r\nphonolite* (* Klingstein. Werner.) covers also the convex summits\r\nof basaltic mountains.\r\n\r\nIt has already been observed, that from the level of the sea to\r\nPortillo, and as far as the entrance on the elevated plain of the\r\nRetama, that is, two-thirds of the total height of the volcano, the\r\nground is so covered with plants, that it is difficult to make\r\ngeological observations. The currents of lava, which we discover on\r\nthe slope of Monte Verde, between the beautiful spring of Dornajito\r\nand Caravela, are black masses, altered by decomposition, sometimes\r\nporous, and with very oblong pores. The basis of these lower lavas\r\nis rather wacke than basalt; when it is spongy, it resembles the\r\namygdaloids* of Frankfort-on-the-Main. (* Wakkenartiger\r\nmandelstein. Steinkaute.) Its fracture is generally irregular;\r\nwherever it is conchoidal, we may presume that the cooling has been\r\nmore rapid, and the mass has been exposed to a less powerful\r\npressure. These currents of lava are not divided into regular\r\nprisms, but into very thin layers, not very regular in their\r\ninclination; they contain much olivine, small grains of magnetic\r\niron, and augite, the colour of which often varies from deep\r\nleek-green to olive green, and which might be mistaken for\r\ncrystallized olivine, though no transition from one to the other of\r\nthese substances exists.* (* Steffens, Handbuch der Oryktognosie\r\ntome 1 s. 364. The crystals which Mr. Friesleben and myself have\r\nmade known under the denomination of foliated olivine (blattriger\r\nolivin) belong, according to Mr. Karsten, to the pyroxene augite.\r\nJournal des Mines de Freiberg 1791 page 215.) Amphibole is in\r\ngeneral very rare at Teneriffe, not only in the modern lithoid\r\nlavas, but also in the ancient basalts, as has been observed by M.\r\nCordier, who resided longer at the Canaries than any other\r\nmineralogist. Nepheline, leucite, idocrase, and meionite have not\r\nyet been seen at the peak of Teneriffe; for a reddish-grey lava,\r\nwhich we found on the slope of Monte Verde, and which contains\r\nsmall microscopic crystals, appears to me to be a close mixture of\r\nbasalt and analcime.* (* This substance, which M. Dolomieu\r\ndiscovered in the amygdaloids of Catania in Sicily, and which\r\naccompanies the stilbites of Fassa in Tyrol, forms, with the\r\nchabasie of Hauy, the genus Cubicit of Werner. M. Cordier found at\r\nTeneriffe xeolite in an amygdaloid which covers the basalts of La\r\nPunta di Naga.) In like manner the lava of Scala, with which the\r\ncity of Naples is paved, contains a close mixture of basalt,\r\nnepheline, and leucite. With respect to this last substance, which\r\nhas hitherto been observed only at Vesuvius and in the environs of\r\nRome, it exists perhaps at the peak of Teneriffe, in the old\r\ncurrents of lava now covered by more recent ejections. Vesuvius,\r\nduring a long series of years, has also thrown out lavas without\r\nleucites: and if it be true, as M. von Buch has rendered very\r\nprobable, that these crystals are formed only in the currents which\r\nflow either from the crater itself, or very near its brink, we must\r\nnot be surprised at not finding them in the lavas of the peak. The\r\nlatter almost all proceed from lateral eruptions, and consequently\r\nhave been exposed to an enormous pressure in the interior of the\r\nvolcano.\r\n\r\nIn the plain of Retama, the basaltic lavas disappear under heaps of\r\nashes, and pumice-stone reduced to powder. Thence to the summit,\r\nfrom 1500 to 1900 toises in height, the volcano exhibits only\r\nvitreous lava with bases of pitch-stone* (* Petrosilex resinite.\r\nHauy.) and obsidian. These lavas, destitute of amphibole and mica,\r\nare of a blackish brown, often varying to the deepest olive green.\r\nThey contain large crystals of feldspar, which are not fissured,\r\nand seldom vitreous. The analogy of those decidedly volcanic masses\r\nwith the resinite porphyries* (* Pechstein-porphyr. Werner.) of the\r\nvalley of Tribisch in Saxony is very remarkable; but the latter,\r\nwhich belong to an extended and metalliferous formation of\r\nporphyry, often contain quartz, which is wanting in the modern\r\nlavas. When the basis of the lavas of the Malpays changes from\r\npitchstone to obsidian, its colour is paler, and is mixed with\r\ngrey; in this case, the feldspar passes by imperceptible gradations\r\nfrom the common to the vitreous. Sometimes both varieties meet in\r\nthe same fragment, as we observed also in the trappean porphyries\r\nof the valley of Mexico. The feldsparry lavas of the Peak, of a\r\nmuch less black tinge than those of Arso in the island of Ischia,\r\nwhiten at the edge of the crater from the effect of the acid\r\nvapours; but internally they are not found to be colourless like\r\nthat of the feldsparry lavas of the Solfatara at Naples, which\r\nperfectly resemble the trappean porphyries at the foot of\r\nChimborazo. In the middle of the Malpays, at the height of the\r\ncavern of ice, we found among the vitreous lavas with pitch-stone\r\nand obsidian bases, blocks of real greenish-grey, or mountain-green\r\nphonolite, with a smooth fracture, and divided into thin laminae,\r\nsonorous and keen edged. These masses were the same as the\r\nporphyrschiefer of the mountain of Bilin in Bohemia; we recognised\r\nin them small long crystals of vitreous feldspar.\r\n\r\nThis regular disposition of lithoid basaltic lava and feldsparry\r\nvitreous lava is analogous to the phenomena of all trappean\r\nmountains; it reminds us of those phonolites lying in very ancient\r\nbasalts, those close mixtures of augite and feldspar which cover\r\nthe hills of wacke or porous amygdaloids: but why are the\r\nporphyritic or feldsparry lavas of the Peak found only on the\r\nsummit of the volcano? Should we conclude from this position that\r\nthey are of more recent formation than the lithoid basaltic lava,\r\nwhich contains olivine and augite? I cannot admit this last\r\nhypothesis; for lateral eruptions may have covered the feldsparry\r\nnucleus, at a period when the crater had ceased its activity. At\r\nVesuvius also, we perceive small crystals of vitreous feldspar only\r\nin the very ancient lavas of the Somma. These lavas, setting aside\r\nthe leucite, very nearly resemble the phonolitic ejections of the\r\nPeak of Teneriffe. In general, the farther we go back from the\r\nperiod of modern eruptions, the more the currents increase both in\r\nsize and extent, acquiring the character of rocks, by the\r\nregularity of their position, by their division into parallel\r\nstrata, or by their independence of the present form of the ground.\r\n\r\nThe Peak of Teneriffe is, next to Lipari, the volcano that has\r\nproduced most obsidian. This abundance is the more striking, as in\r\nother regions of the earth, in Iceland, in Hungary, in Mexico, and\r\nin the kingdom of Quito, we meet with obsidians only at great\r\ndistances from burning volcanoes. Sometimes they are scattered over\r\nthe fields in angular pieces; for instance, near Popayan, in South\r\nAmerica; at other times they form isolated rocks, as at Quinche,\r\nnear Quito. In other places (and this circumstance is very\r\nremarkable), they are disseminated in pearl-stone, as at\r\nCinapecuaro, in the province of Mechoacan,* (* To the west of the\r\ncity of Mexico.) and at the Cabo de Gates, in Spain. At the peak of\r\nTeneriffe the obsidian is not found towards the base of the\r\nvolcano, which is covered with modern lava: it is frequent only\r\ntowards the summit, especially from the plain of Retama, where very\r\nfine specimens may be collected. This peculiar position, and the\r\ncircumstance that the obsidian of the Peak has been ejected by a\r\ncrater which for ages past has thrown out no flames, favour the\r\nopinion, that volcanic vitrifications, wherever they are found, are\r\nto be considered as of very ancient formation.\r\n\r\nObsidian, jade, and Lydian-stone,* (* Lydischerstein.) are three\r\nminerals, which nations ignorant of the use of copper or iron, have\r\nin all ages employed for making keen-edged weapons. We see that\r\nwandering hordes have dragged with them, in their distant journeys,\r\nstones, the natural position of which the mineralogist has not yet\r\nbeen able to determine. Hatchets of jade, covered with Aztec\r\nhieroglyphics, which I brought from Mexico, resemble both in their\r\nform and nature those made use of by the Gauls, and those we find\r\namong the South Sea islanders. The Mexicans dug obsidian from\r\nmines, which were of vast extent; and they employed it for making\r\nknives, sword-blades, and razors. In like manner the Guanches, (in\r\nwhose language obsidian was called tabona,) fixed splinters of that\r\nmineral to the ends of their lances. They carried on a considerable\r\ntrade in it with the neighbouring islands; and from the consumption\r\nthus occasioned, and the quantity of obsidian which must have been\r\nbroken in the course of manufacture, we may presume that this\r\nmineral has become scarce from the lapse of ages. We are surprised\r\nto see an Atlantic nation substituting, like the natives of\r\nAmerica, vitrified lava for iron. In both countries this variety of\r\nlava was employed as an object of ornament: and the inhabitants of\r\nQuito made beautiful looking-glasses with an obsidian divided into\r\nparallel laminae.\r\n\r\nThere are three varieties of obsidian at the Peak. Some form\r\nenormous blocks, several toises long, and often of a spheroidal\r\nshape. We might suppose that they had been thrown out in a softened\r\nstate, and had afterwards been subject to a rotary motion. They\r\ncontain a quantity of vitreous feldspar, of a snow-white colour,\r\nand the most brilliant pearly lustre. These obsidians are,\r\nnevertheless, but little transparent on the edges; they are almost\r\nopaque, of a brownish black, and of an imperfect conchoidal\r\nfracture. They pass into pitch-stone; and we may consider them as\r\nporphyries with a basis of obsidian. The second variety is found in\r\nfragments much less considerable. It is in general of a greenish\r\nblack, sometimes of murky grey, very seldom of a perfect black,\r\nlike the obsidian of Hecla and Mexico. Its fracture is perfectly\r\nconchoidal, and it is extremely transparent on the edges. I have\r\nfound in it neither amphibole nor pyroxene, but some small white\r\npoints, which seem to be feldspar. None of the obsidians of the\r\nPeak appear in those grey masses of pearl or lavender-blue,\r\nstriped, and in separate wedge-formed pieces, like the obsidian of\r\nQuito, Mexico, and Lipari, and which resemble the fibrous plates of\r\nthe crystalites of our glass-houses, on which Sir James Hall, Dr.\r\nThompson, and M. de Bellevue, have published some curious\r\nobservations.* (* The name crystalites has been given to the\r\ncrystalized thin plates observed in glass cooling slowly. The term\r\nglastenized glass is employed by Dr. Thompson and others to\r\nindicate glass which by slow cooling is wholly unvitrified, and has\r\nassumed the appearance of a fossil substance, or real glass-stone.)\r\n\r\nThe third variety of obsidian of the Peak is the most remarkable of\r\nthe whole, from its connexion with pumice-stone. It is, like that\r\nabove described, of a greenish black, sometimes of a murky grey,\r\nbut its very thin plates alternate with layers of pumice-stone. Dr.\r\nThomson's fine collection at Naples contained similar examples of\r\nlithoid lava of Vesuvius, divided into very distinct plates, only a\r\nline thick. The fibres of the pumice-stone of the Peak are very\r\nseldom parallel to each other, and perpendicular to the strata of\r\nobsidian; they are most commonly irregular, asbestoidal, like\r\nfibrous glass-gall; and instead of being disseminated in the\r\nobsidian, like crystalites, they are found simply adhering to one\r\nof the external surfaces of this substance. During my stay at\r\nMadrid, M. Hergen showed me several specimens in the mineralogical\r\ncollection of Don Jose Clavijo; and for a long time the Spanish\r\nmineralogists considered them as furnishing undoubted proofs, that\r\npumice-stone owes its origin to obsidian, in some degree deprived\r\nof colour, and swelled by volcanic fire. I was formerly of this\r\nopinion, which, however, must be understood to refer to one variety\r\nonly of pumice. I even thought, with many other geologists, that\r\nobsidian, so far from being vitrified lava, belonged to rocks that\r\nwere not volcanic; and that the fire, forcing its way through the\r\nbasalts, the green-stone rocks, the phonolites, and the porphyries\r\nwith bases of pitchstone and obsidian, the lavas and pumice-stone\r\nwere no other than these same rocks altered by the action of the\r\nvolcanoes. The deprivation of colour and extraordinary swelling\r\nwhich the greater part of the obsidians undergo in a forge-fire,\r\ntheir transition into pitch-stone, and their position in regions\r\nvery distant from burning volcanoes, appear to be phenomena very\r\ndifficult to reconcile, when we consider the obsidians as volcanic\r\nglass. A more profound study of nature, new journeys, and\r\nobservations made on the productions of burning volcanoes, have led\r\nme to renounce those ideas.\r\n\r\nIt appears to me at present extremely probable, that obsidians, and\r\nporphyries with bases of obsidian, are vitrified masses, the\r\ncooling of which has been too rapid to change them into lithoid\r\nlava. I consider even the pearlstone as an unvitrified obsidian:\r\nfor among the minerals in the King's cabinet at Berlin there are\r\nvolcanic glasses from Lipari, in which we see striated crystalites,\r\nof a pearl-grey colour, and of an earthy appearance, forming\r\ngradual approaches to a granular lithoid lava, like the pearlstone\r\nof Cinapecuaro, in Mexico. The oblong bubbles observed in the\r\nobsidians of every continent are incontestible proofs of their\r\nancient state of igneous fluidity; and Dr. Thompson possesses\r\nspecimens from Lipari, which are very instructive in this point of\r\nview, because fragments of red porphyry, or porphyry lavas, which\r\ndo not entirely fill up the cavities of the obsidian, are found\r\nenveloped in them. We might say, that these fragments had not time\r\nto enter into complete solution in the liquified mass. They contain\r\nvitreous feldspar, and augite, and are the same as the celebrated\r\ncolumnar porphyries of the island of Panaria, which, without having\r\nbeen part of a current of lava, seem raised up in the form of\r\nhillocks, like many of the porphyries in Auvergne, in the Euganean\r\nmountains, and in the Cordilleras of the Andes.\r\n\r\nThe objections against the volcanic origin of obsidians, founded on\r\ntheir speedy loss of colour, and their swelling by a slow fire,\r\nhave been shaken by the ingenious experiments of Sir James Hall.\r\nThese experiments prove, that a stone which is fusible only at\r\nthirty-eight degrees of Wedgwood's pyrometer, yields a glass that\r\nsoftens at fourteen degrees; and that this glass, melted again and\r\nunvitrified (glastenized), is fusible again only at thirty-five\r\ndegrees of the same pyrometer. I applied the blowpipe to some black\r\npumice-stone from the volcano of the isle of Bourbon, which, on the\r\nslightest contact with the flame, whitened and melted into an\r\nenamel.\r\n\r\nBut whether obsidians be primitive rocks which have undergone the\r\naction of volcanic fire, or lavas repeatedly melted within the\r\ncrater, the origin of the pumice-stones contained in the obsidian\r\nof the Peak of Teneriffe is not less problematic. This subject is\r\nthe more worthy of being investigated, since it is generally\r\ninteresting to the geology of volcanoes; and since that excellent\r\nmineralogist, M. Fleuriau de Bellevue, after having examined Italy\r\nand the adjacent islands with great attention, affirms, that it is\r\nhighly improbable that pumice-stone owes its origin to the swelling\r\nof obsidian.\r\n\r\nThe experiments of M. da Camara, and those I made in 1802, tend to\r\nsupport the opinion, that the pumice-stones adherent to the\r\nobsidians of the Peak of Teneriffe do not unite to them\r\naccidentally, but are produced by the expansion of an elastic\r\nfluid, which is disengaged from the compact vitreous matter. This\r\nidea had for a long time occupied the mind of a person highly\r\ndistinguished for his talents and reputation at Quito, who,\r\nunacquainted with the labours of the mineralogists of Europe, had\r\ndevoted himself to researches on the volcanoes of his country. Don\r\nJuan de Larea, one of those men lately sacrificed to the fury of\r\nfaction, had been struck with the phenomena exhibited by obsidians\r\nexposed to a white heat. He had thought, that, wherever volcanoes\r\nact in the centre of a country covered with porphyry with base of\r\nobsidian, the elastic fluids must cause a swelling of the liquified\r\nmass, and perform an important part in the earthquakes preceding\r\neruptions. Without adopting an opinion, which seems somewhat bold,\r\nI made, in concert with M. Larea, a series of experiments on the\r\ntumefaction of the volcanic vitreous substances at Teneriffe, and\r\non those which are found at Quinche, in the kingdom of Quito. To\r\njudge of the augmentation of their bulk, we measured pieces exposed\r\nto a forge-fire of moderate heat, by the water they displaced from\r\na cylindric glass, enveloping the spongy mass with a thin coating\r\nof wax. According to our experiments, the obsidians swelled very\r\nunequally: those of the Peak and the black varieties of Cotopaxi\r\nand of Quinche increased nearly five times their bulk.\r\n\r\nThe colour of the pumice-stones of the Peak leads to another\r\nimportant observation. The sea of white ashes which encircles the\r\nPiton, and covers the vast plain of Retama, is a certain proof of\r\nthe former activity of the crater: for in all volcanoes, even when\r\nthere are lateral eruptions, the ashes and the rapilli issue\r\nconjointly with the vapours only from the opening at the summit of\r\nthe mountain. Now, at Teneriffe, the black rapilli extend from the\r\nfoot of the Peak to the sea-shore; while the white ashes, which are\r\nonly pumice ground to powder, and among which I have discovered,\r\nwith a lens, fragments of vitreous feldspar and pyroxene,\r\nexclusively occupy the region next to the Peak. This peculiar\r\ndistribution seems to confirm the observations made long ago at\r\nVesuvius, that the white ashes are thrown out last, and indicate\r\nthe end of the eruption. In proportion as the elasticity of the\r\nvapours diminishes, the matter is thrown to a less distance; and\r\nthe black rapilli, which issue first, when the lava has ceased\r\nrunning, must necessarily reach farther than the white rapilli. The\r\nlatter appear to have been exposed to the action of a more intense\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nI have now examined the exterior structure of the Peak, and the\r\ncomposition of its volcanic productions, from the region of the\r\ncoast to the top of the Piton:--I have endeavoured to render these\r\nresearches interesting, by comparing the phenomena of the volcano\r\nof Teneriffe with those that are observed in other regions, the\r\nsoil of which is equally undermined by subterranean fires. This\r\nmode of viewing Nature in the universality of her relations is no\r\ndoubt adverse to the rapidity desirable in an itinerary; but it\r\nappears to me that, in a narrative, the principal end of which is\r\nthe progress of physical knowledge, every other consideration ought\r\nto be subservient to those of instruction and utility. By isolating\r\nfacts, travellers, whose labours are in every other respect\r\nvaluable, have given currency to many false ideas of the pretended\r\ncontrasts which Nature offers in Africa, in New Holland, and on the\r\nridge of the Cordilleras. The great geological phenomena are\r\nsubject to regular laws, as well as the forms of plants and\r\nanimals. The ties which unite these phenomena, the relations which\r\nexist between the varied forms of organized beings, are discovered\r\nonly when we have acquired the habit of viewing the globe as a\r\ngreat whole; and when we consider in the same point of view the\r\ncomposition of rocks, the causes which alter them, and the\r\nproductions of the soil, in the most distant regions.\r\n\r\nHaving treated of the volcanic substances of the isle of Teneriffe,\r\nthere now remains to be solved a question intimately connected with\r\nthe preceding investigation. Does the archipelago of the Canary\r\nIslands contain any rocks of primitive or secondary formation; or\r\nis there any production observed, that has not been modified by\r\nfire? This interesting problem has been considered by the\r\nnaturalists of Lord Macartney's expedition, and by those who\r\naccompanied captain Baudin in his voyage to the Austral regions.\r\nTheir opinions are in direct opposition to each other; and the\r\ncontradiction is the more striking, as the question does not refer\r\nto one of those geological reveries which we are accustomed to call\r\nsystems, but to a positive fact.\r\n\r\nDoctor Gillan imagined that he observed, between Laguna and the\r\nport of Orotava, in very deep ravines, beds of primitive rocks.\r\nThis, however, is a mistake. What Dr. Gillan calls somewhat\r\nvaguely, mountains of hard ferruginous clay, are nothing but an\r\nalluvium which we find at the foot of every volcano. Strata of clay\r\naccompany basalts, as tufas accompany modern lavas. Neither M.\r\nCordier nor myself observed in any part of Teneriffe a primitive\r\nrock, either in its natural place, or thrown out by the mouth of\r\nthe Peak; and the absence of these rocks characterizes almost every\r\nisland of small extent that has an unextinguishied volcano. We know\r\nnothing positive of the mountains of the Azores; but it is certain,\r\nthat the island of Bourbon as well as Teneriffe, exhibits only a\r\nheap of lavas and basalts. No volcanic rock rears its head, either\r\non the Gros Morne, or on the volcano of Bourbon, or on the colossal\r\npyramid of Cimandef, which is perhaps more elevated than the Peak\r\nof the Canary Islands.\r\n\r\nBory St. Vincent nevertheless asserted, that lavas including\r\nfragments of granite have been found on the elevated plain of\r\nRetama; and M. Broussonnet informed me, that on a hill above\r\nGuimar, fragments of mica-slate, containing beautiful plates of\r\nspecular iron, had been found. I can affirm nothing respecting the\r\naccuracy of this latter statement, which it would be so much the\r\nmore important to verify, as M. Poli, of Naples, is in possession\r\nof a fragment of rock thrown out by Vesuvius,* which I found to be\r\na real mica-slate. (* In the valuable collection of Dr. Thomson,\r\nwho resided at Naples till 1805, is a fragment of lava enclosing a\r\nreal granite, which is composed of reddish feldspar with a pearly\r\nlustre like adularia, quartz, mica, hornblende, and, what is very\r\nremarkable, lazulite. But in general the masses of known primitive\r\nrocks, (I mean those which perfectly resemble our granites, our\r\ngneiss, and our mica-slates) are very rare in lavas; the substances\r\nwe commonly denote by the name of granite, thrown out by Vesuvius,\r\nare mixtures of nepheline, mica, and pyroxene. We are ignorant\r\nwhether these mixtures constitute rocks sui generis placed under\r\ngranite, and consequently of more ancient date; or simply form\r\neither intermediate strata on veins, in the interior of the\r\nprimitive mountains, the tops of which appear at the surface of the\r\nglobe.) Every thing that tends to enlighten us with respect to the\r\nsite of the volcanic fire, and the position of rocks subject to its\r\naction, is highly interesting to geology.\r\n\r\nIt is possible, that at the Peak of Teneriffe, the fragments of\r\nprimitive rocks thrown out by the mouth of the volcano may be less\r\nrare than they at present appear to be, and may be heaped together\r\nin some ravine, not yet visited by travellers. In fact, at\r\nVesuvius, these same fragments are met with only in one single\r\nplace, at the Fossa Grande, where they are hidden under a thick\r\nlayer of ashes. If this ravine had not long ago attracted the\r\nattention of naturalists, when masses of granular limestone, and\r\nother primitive rocks, were laid bare by the rains, we might have\r\nthought them as rare at Vesuvius, as they are, at least in\r\nappearance, at the Peak of Teneriffe.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the fragments of granite, gneiss, and mica-slate,\r\nfound on the shores of Santa Cruz and Orotava, they were probably\r\nbrought in ships as ballast. They no more belong to the soil where\r\nthey lie, than the feldsparry lavas of Etna, seen in the pavements\r\nof Hamburg and other towns of the north. The naturalist is exposed\r\nto a thousand errors, if he lose sight of the changes, produced on\r\nthe surface of the globe by the intercourse between nations. We\r\nmight be led to say, that man, when expatriating himself; is\r\ndesirous that everything should change country with him. Not only\r\nplants, insects, and different species of small quadrupeds, follow\r\nhim across the ocean; his active industry covers the shores with\r\nrocks, which he has torn from the soil in distant climes.\r\n\r\nThough it be certain, that no scientific observer has hitherto\r\nfound at Teneriffe primitive strata, or even those trappean and\r\nambiguous porphyries, which constitute the bases of Etna, and of\r\nseveral volcanoes of the Andes, we must not conclude from this\r\nisolated fact, that the whole archipelago of the Canaries is the\r\nproduction of submarine fires. The island of Gomera contains\r\nmountains of granite and mica-slate; and it is, undoubtedly, in\r\nthese very ancient rocks, that we must seek there, as well as on\r\nall other parts of the globe, the centre of the volcanic action.\r\nAmphibole, sometimes pure and forming intermediate strata, at other\r\ntimes mixed with granite, as in the basanites or basalts of the\r\nancients, may, of itself, furnish all the iron contained in the\r\nblack and stony lavas. This quantity amounts in the basalt of the\r\nmodern mineralogists only to 0.20, while in amphibole it exceeds 0.\r\n30.\r\n\r\nFrom several well-informed persons, to whom I addressed myself, I\r\nlearned that there are calcareous formations in the Great Canary,\r\nForteventura, and Lancerota.* (* At Lancerota calcareous stone is\r\nburned to lime with a fire made of the alhulaga, a new species of\r\nthorny and arborescent Sonchus.) I was not able to determine the\r\nnature of this secondary rock; but it appears certain, that the\r\nisland of Teneriffe is altogether destitute of it; and that in its\r\nalluvial lands it exhibits only clayey calcareous tufa, alternating\r\nwith volcanic breccia, said to contain, (near the village of La\r\nRambla, at Calderas, and near Candelaria,) plants, imprints of\r\nfishes, buccinites, and other fossil marine productions. M. Cordier\r\nbrought away some of this tufa, which resembles that in the\r\nenvirons of Naples and Rome, and contains fragments of reeds. At\r\nthe Salvages, which islands La Perouse took at a distance for\r\nmasses of scoriae, even fibrous gypsum is found.\r\n\r\nI had seen, while herborizing between the port of Orotava and the\r\ngarden of La Paz, heaps of greyish calcareous stones, of an\r\nimperfect conchoidal fracture, and analogous to that of Mount Jura\r\nand the Apennines. I was informed that these stones were extracted\r\nfrom a quarry near Rambla; and that there were similar quarries\r\nnear Realejo, and the mountain of Roxas, above Adexa. This\r\ninformation led me into an error. As the coasts of Portugal consist\r\nof basalts covering calcareous rocks containing shells, I imagined\r\nthat a trappean formation, like that of the Vicentin in Lombardy,\r\nand of Harutsh in Africa, might have extended from the banks of the\r\nTagus and Cape St. Vincent as far as the Canary Islands; and that\r\nthe basalts of the Peak might perhaps conceal a secondary\r\ncalcareous stone. These conjectures exposed me to severe\r\nanimadversions from M. G.A. de Luc, who is of opinion that every\r\nvolcanic island is only an accumulation of lavas and scoriae. M. de\r\nLuc declares it is impossible that real lava should contain\r\nfragments of vegetable substances. Our collections, however,\r\ncontain pieces of trunks of palm-trees, enclosed and penetrated by\r\nthe very liquid lava of the isle of Bourbon.\r\n\r\nThough Teneriffe belongs to a group of islands of considerable\r\nextent, the Peak exhibits nevertheless all the characteristics of a\r\nmountain rising on a solitary islet. The lead finds no bottom at a\r\nlittle distance from the ports of Santa Cruz, Orotava, and\r\nGarachico: in this respect it is like St. Helena. The ocean, as\r\nwell as the continents, has its mountains and its plains; and, if\r\nwe except the Andes, volcanic cones are formed everywhere in the\r\nlower regions of the globe.\r\n\r\nAs the Peak rises amid a system of basalts and old lava, and as the\r\nwhole part which is visible above the surface of the waters\r\nexhibits burnt substances, it has been supposed that this immense\r\npyramid is the effect of a progressive accumulation of lavas; or\r\nthat it contains in its centre a nucleus of primitive rocks. Both\r\nof these suppositions appear to me ill-founded. I think there is as\r\nlittle probability that mountains of granite, gneiss, or primitive\r\ncalcareous stone have existed where we now see the tops of the\r\nPeak, of Vesuvius, and of Etna, as in the plains where almost in\r\nour own time has been formed the volcano of Jorullo, which is more\r\nthan a third of the height of Vesuvius. On examining the\r\ncircumstances which accompanied the formation of the new island,\r\ncalled Sabrina, in the archipelago of the Azores;* (* At Sabrina\r\nisland, near St. Michael's, the crater opened at the foot of a\r\nsolid rock, of almost a cubical form. This rock, surmounted by a\r\nsmall elevated plain perfectly level, is more than two hundred\r\ntoises in breadth. Its formation was anterior to that of the\r\ncrater, into which, a few days after its opening, the sea made an\r\nirruption. At Kameni, the smoke was not even visible till\r\ntwenty-six days after the appearance of the upheaved rocks.\r\nPhilosophical Transactions volume 26 pages 69 and 200, volume 27\r\npage 353. All these phenomena, on which Mr. Hawkins collected very\r\nvaluable observations during his abode at Santorino, are\r\nunfavourable to the idea commonly entertained of the origin of\r\nvolcanic mountains. They are usually ascribed to a progressive\r\naccumulation of liquified matter, and the diffusion of lavas\r\nissuing from a central mouth.) on carefully reading the minute and\r\nsimple narrative, given by the Jesuit Bourguignon of the slow\r\nappearance of the islet of the little Kameni, near Santorino; we\r\nfind that these extraordinary eruptions are generally preceded by a\r\nswelling of the softened crust of the globe. Rocks appear above the\r\nwaters before the flames force their way, or lavas issue from the\r\ncrater: we must distinguish between the nucleus raised up, and the\r\nmass of lavas and scoriae, which successively increases its\r\ndimensions.\r\n\r\nIt is true that from all existing records of revolutions of this\r\nkind, the perpendicular height of the stony nucleus appears never\r\nto have exceeded one hundred and fifty or two hundred toises; even\r\ntaking into the account the depth of the sea, the bottom of which\r\nhad been lifted up: but when considering the great effects of\r\nnature, and the intensity of its forces, the bulk of the masses\r\nmust not deter the geologist in his speculations. Every thing\r\nindicates that the physical changes of which tradition has\r\npreserved the remembrance, exhibit but a feeble image of those\r\ngigantic catastrophes which have given mountains their present\r\nform, changed the positions of the rocky strata, and buried\r\nsea-shells on the summits of the higher Alps. Doubtless, in those\r\nremote times which preceded the existence of the human race, the\r\nraised crust of the globe produced those domes of trappean\r\nporphyry, those hills of isolated basalt on vast elevated plains,\r\nthose solid nuclei which are clothed in the modern lavas of the\r\nPeak, of Etna, and of Cotopaxi. The volcanic revolutions have\r\nsucceeded each other after long intervals, and at very different\r\nperiods: of this we see the vestiges in the transition mountains,\r\nin the secondary strata, and in those of alluvium. Volcanoes of\r\nearlier date than the sandstone and calcareous rocks have been for\r\nages extinguished; those which are yet in activity are in general\r\nsurrounded only with breccias and modern tufas; but nothing hinders\r\nus from admitting, that the archipelago of the Canaries may exhibit\r\nsome real rocks of secondary formation, if we recollect that\r\nsubterranean fires have been there rekindled in the midst of a\r\nsystem of basalts and very ancient lavas.\r\n\r\nWe seek in vain in the Periplus of Hanno or of Scylax for the first\r\nwritten notions on the eruptions of the Peak of Teneriffe. Those\r\nnavigators sailed timidly along the coast, anchoring every evening\r\nin some bay, and had no knowledge of a volcano distant fifty-six\r\nleagues from the coast of Africa. Hanno nevertheless relates, that\r\nhe saw torrents of light, which seemed to fall on the sea; that\r\nevery night the coast was covered with fire; and that the great\r\nmountain, called the Car of the Gods, appeared to throw up sheets\r\nof flame, which rose even to the clouds. But this mountain,\r\nsituated northward of the island of the Gorilli, formed the western\r\nextremity of the Atlas chain; and it is also very uncertain whether\r\nthe flames seen by Hanno were the effect of some volcanic eruption,\r\nor whether they must be attributed to the custom, common to many\r\nnations, of setting fire to the forests and dry grass of the\r\nsavannahs. In our own days similar doubts were entertained by the\r\nnaturalists, who, in the voyage of d'Entrecasteaux, saw the island\r\nof Amsterdam covered with a thick smoke. On the coast of the\r\nCaracas, trains of reddish fire, fed by the burning grass, appeared\r\nto me, for several nights, under the delusive semblance of a\r\ncurrent of lava, descending from the mountains, and dividing itself\r\ninto several branches.\r\n\r\nThough the narratives of Hanno and Scylax, in the state in which\r\nthey have reached us, contain no passage which we can reasonably\r\napply to the Canary Islands, it is very probable that the\r\nCarthaginians, and even the Phoenicians, had some knowledge of the\r\nPeak of Teneriffe. In the time of Plato and Aristotle, vague\r\nnotions of it had reached the Greeks, who considered the whole of\r\nthe coast of Africa, beyond the Pillars of Hercules, as thrown into\r\ndisorder by the fire of volcanoes. The Abode of the Blessed, which\r\nwas sought first in the north, beyond the Riphaean mountains, among\r\nthe Hyperboreans, and next to the south of Cyrenaica, was supposed\r\nto be situated in regions that were considered to be westward,\r\nbeing the direction in which the world known to the ancients\r\nterminated. The name of Fortunate Islands was long in as vague\r\nsignification, as that of El Dorado among the conquerors of\r\nAmerica. Happiness was thought to reside at the end of the earth,\r\nas we seek for the most exquisite enjoyments of the mind in an\r\nideal world beyond the limits of reality.* (* The idea of the\r\nhappiness, the great civilization, and the riches of the\r\ninhabitants of the north, was common to the Greeks, to the people\r\nof India, and to the Mexicans.)\r\n\r\nWe must not be surprised that, previous to the time of Aristotle,\r\nwe find no accurate notion respecting the Canary Islands and the\r\nvolcanoes they contain, among the Greek geographers. The only\r\nnation whose navigations extended toward the west and the north,\r\nthe Carthaginians, were interested in throwing a veil of mystery\r\nover those distant regions. While the senate of Carthage was averse\r\nto any partial emigration, it pointed out those islands as a place\r\nof refuge in times of trouble and public misfortune; they were to\r\nthe Carthaginians what the free soil of America has become to\r\nEuropeans amidst their religious and civil dissensions.\r\n\r\nThe Canaries were not better known to the Romans till eighty-four\r\nyears before the reign of Augustus. A private individual was\r\ndesirous of executing the project, which wise foresight had\r\ndictated to the senate of Carthage. Sertorius, conquered by Sylla,\r\nand weary of the din of war, looked out for a safe and peaceable\r\nretreat. He chose the Fortunate Islands, of which a delightful\r\npicture had been drawn for him on the shores of Baetica. He\r\ncarefully combined the notions he acquired from travellers; but in\r\nthe little that has been transmitted to us of those notions, and in\r\nthe more minute descriptions of Sebosus and Juba, there is no\r\nmention of volcanoes or volcanic eruptions. Scarcely can we\r\nrecognise the isle of Teneriffe, and the snows with which the\r\nsummit of the Peak is covered in winter, in the name of Nivaria,\r\ngiven to one of the Fortunate Islands. Hence we might conclude,\r\nthat the volcano at that time threw out no flames, if it were\r\nallowable so to interpret the silence of a few authors, whom we\r\nknow only by short fragments or dry nomenclatures. The naturalist\r\nvainly seeks in history for documents of the first eruptions of the\r\nPeak; he nowhere finds any but in the language of the Guanches, in\r\nwhich the word Echeyde denotes, at the same time, hell and the\r\nvolcano of Teneriffe.\r\n\r\nOf all the written testimonies, the oldest I have found in relation\r\nto the activity of this volcano dates from the beginning of the\r\nsixteenth century. It is contained in the narrative of the voyage\r\nof Aloysio Cadamusto, who landed at the Canaries in 1505. This\r\ntraveller was witness of no eruptions, but he positively affirms\r\nthat, like Etna, this mountain burns without interruption, and that\r\nthe fire has been seen by christians held in slavery by the\r\nGuanches of Teneriffe. The Peak, therefore, was not at that time in\r\nthe state of repose in which we find it at present; for it is\r\ncertain that no navigator or inhabitant of Teneriffe has seen issue\r\nfrom the mouth of the Peak, I will not say flames, but even any\r\nsmoke visible at a distance. It would be well, perhaps, were the\r\nfunnel of the Caldera to open anew; the lateral eruptions would\r\nthereby be rendered less violent, and the whole group of islands\r\nwould be less endangered by earthquakes.\r\n\r\nThe eruptions of the Peak have been very rare for two centuries\r\npast, and these long intervals appear to characterize volcanoes\r\nhighly elevated. The smallest one of all, Stromboli, is almost\r\nalways burning. At Vesuvius, the eruptions are rarer than formerly,\r\nthough still more frequent than those of Etna and the Peak of\r\nTeneriffe. The colossal summits of the Andes, Cotopaxi and\r\nTungurahua, scarcely have an eruption once in a century. We may\r\nsay, that in active volcanoes the frequency of the eruptions is in\r\nthe inverse ratio of the height and the mass. The Peak also had\r\nseemed extinguished during ninety-two years, when, in 1798, it made\r\nits last eruption by a lateral opening formed in the mountain of\r\nChahorra. In this interval Vesuvius had sixteen eruptions.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the mountainous part of the kingdom of Quito may be\r\nconsidered as an immense volcano, occupying more than seven hundred\r\nsquare leagues of surface, and throwing out flames by different\r\ncones, known under the particular denominations of Cotopaxi,\r\nTungurahua, and Pichincha. The group of the Canary Islands is\r\nsituated on the same sort of submarine volcano. The fire makes its\r\nway sometimes by one and sometimes by another of these islands.\r\nTeneriffe alone contains in its centre an immense pyramid\r\nterminating in a crater, and throwing out, from one century to\r\nanother, lava by its flanks. In the other islands, the different\r\neruptions have taken place in various parts; and we nowhere find\r\nthose isolated mountains to which the volcanic effects are\r\nconfined. The basaltic crust, formed by ancient volcanoes, seems\r\neverywhere undermined; and the currents of lava, seen at Lancerota\r\nand Palma, remind us, by every geological affinity, of the eruption\r\nwhich took place in 1301 at the island of Ischia, amid the tufas of\r\nEpomeo.\r\n\r\nThe exclusively lateral action of the peak of Teneriffe is a\r\ngeological phenomenon, the more remarkable as it contributes to\r\nmake the mountains which are backed by the principal volcano appear\r\nisolated. It is true, that in Etna and Vesuvius the great flowings\r\nof lava do not proceed from the crater itself, and that the\r\nabundance of melted matter is generally in the inverse ratio of the\r\nheight of the opening whence the lava is ejected. But at Vesuvius\r\nand Etna a lateral eruption constantly terminates by flashes of\r\nflame and by ashes issuing from the crater, that is, from the\r\nsummit of the mountain. At the Peak this phenomenon has not been\r\nwitnessed for ages: and yet recently, in the eruption of 1798, the\r\ncrater remained quite inactive. Its bottom did not sink in; while\r\nat Vesuvius, as M. von Buch has observed, the greater or less depth\r\nof the crater is an infallible indication of the proximity of a new\r\neruption.\r\n\r\nI might terminate these geological sketches by enquiring into the\r\nnature of the combustible which has fed for so many thousands of\r\nyears the fire of the peak of Teneriffe;--I might examine whether\r\nit be sodium or potassium, the metallic basis of some earth,\r\ncarburet of hydrogen, or pure sulphur combined with iron, that\r\nburns in the volcano;--but wishing to limit myself to what may be\r\nthe object of direct observation, I shall not take upon me to solve\r\na problem for which we have not yet sufficient data. We know not\r\nwhether we may conclude, from the enormous quantity of sulphur\r\ncontained in the crater of the Peak, that it is this substance\r\nwhich keeps up the heat of the volcano; or whether the fire, fed by\r\nsome combustible of an unknown nature, effects merely the\r\nsublimation of the sulphur. What we learn from observation is, that\r\nin craters which are still burning, sulphur is very rare; while all\r\nthe ancient volcanoes end in becoming sulphur-pits. We might\r\npresume that, in the former, the sulphur is combined with oxygen,\r\nwhile, in the latter, it is merely sublimated; for nothing hitherto\r\nauthorises us to admit that it is formed in the interior of\r\nvolcanoes, like ammonia and the neutral salts. When we were yet\r\nunacquainted with sulphur, except as disseminated in the\r\nmuriatiferous gypsum and in the Alpine limestone, we were almost\r\nforced to the belief, that in every part of the globe the volcanic\r\nfire acted on rocks of secondary formation; but recent observations\r\nhave proved that sulphur exists in great abundance in those\r\nprimitive rocks which so many phenomena indicate as the centre of\r\nthe volcanic action. Near Alausi, at the back of the Andes of\r\nQuito, I found an immense quantity in a bed of quartz, which formed\r\na layer of mica-slate. This fact is the more important, as it is in\r\nstrict conformity with the conclusions deduced from the observation\r\nof those fragments of ancient rocks which are thrown out intact by\r\nvolcanoes.\r\n\r\nWe have just considered the island of Teneriffe merely in a\r\ngeological point of view; we have seen the Peak towering amid\r\nfractured strata of basalt and mandelstein; let us examine how\r\nthese fused masses have been gradually adorned with vegetable\r\nclothing, what is the distribution of plants on the steep declivity\r\nof the volcano, and what is the aspect or physiognomy of vegetation\r\nin the Canary Islands.\r\n\r\nIn the northern part of the temperate zone, the cryptogamous plants\r\nare the first that cover the stony crust of the globe. The lichens\r\nand mosses, that develop their foliage beneath the snows, are\r\nsucceeded by grumina and other phanerogamous plants. This order of\r\nvegetation differs on the borders of the torrid zone, and in the\r\ncountries between the tropics. We there find, it is true, whatever\r\nsome travellers may have asserted, not only on the mountains, but\r\nalso in humid and shady places, almost on a level with the sea,\r\nFunaria, Dicranum, and Bryum; and these genera, among their\r\nnumerous species, exhibit several which are common to Lapland, to\r\nthe Peak of Teneriffe, and to the Blue Mountains of Jamaica. (This\r\nextraordinary fact was first observed by M. Swarz. It was confirmed\r\nby M. Willdenouw when he carefully examined our herbals, especially\r\nthe collection of cryptogamous plants, which we gathered on the\r\ntops of the Andes, in a region of the world where organic life is\r\ntotally different from that of the old world.) Nevertheless, in\r\ngeneral, it is not by mosses and lichens that vegetation in the\r\ncountries near the tropics begins. In the Canary Islands, as well\r\nas in Guinea, and on the rocky coasts of Peru, the first vegetation\r\nwhich prepares the soil are the succulent plants; the leaves of\r\nwhich, provided with an infinite number of orifices* (* The pores\r\ncorticaux of M. Decandolle, discovered by Gleichen, and figured by\r\nHedwig.) and cutaneous vessels, deprive the ambient air of the\r\nwater it holds in solution. Fixed in the crevices of volcanic\r\nrocks, they form, as it were, that first layer of vegetable earth\r\nwith which the currents of lithoid lava are clothed. Wherever these\r\nlavas are scorified, and where they have a shining surface, as in\r\nthe basaltic mounds to the north of Lancerota, the development of\r\nvegetation is extremely slow, and many ages may pass away before\r\nshrubs can take root. It is only when lavas are covered with tufa\r\nand ashes, that the volcanic islands, losing that appearance of\r\nnudity which marks their origin, bedeck themselves in rich and\r\nbrilliant vegetation.\r\n\r\nIn its present state, the island of Teneriffe, the Chinerfe* (* Of\r\nChinerfe the Europeans have formed, by corruption, Tchineriffe and\r\nTeneriffe.) of the Guanches, exhibits five zones of plants, which\r\nwe may distinguish by the names--region of vines, region of\r\nlaurels, region of pines, region of the retama, and region of\r\ngrasses. These zones are ranged in stages, one above another, and\r\noccupy, on the steep declivity of the Peak, a perpendicular height\r\nof 1750 toises; while fifteen degrees farther north, on the\r\nPyrenees, snow descends to thirteen or fourteen hundred toises of\r\nabsolute elevation. If the plants of Teneriffe do not reach the\r\nsummit of the volcano, it is not because the perpetual snow and the\r\ncold of the surrounding atmosphere mark limits which they cannot\r\npass; it is the scorified lava of the Malpays, the powdered and\r\nbarren pumice-stone of the Piton, which impede the migration of\r\nplants towards the brink of the crater.\r\n\r\nThe first zone, that of the vines, extends from the sea-shore to\r\ntwo or three hundred toises of height; it is that which is most\r\ninhabited, and the only part carefully cultivated. In the low\r\nregions, at the port of Orotava, and wherever the winds have free\r\naccess, the centigrade thermometer stands in winter, in the months\r\nof January and February, at noon, between fifteen and seventeen\r\ndegrees; and the greatest heats of summer do not exceed twenty-five\r\nor twenty-six degrees. The mean temperature of the coasts of\r\nTeneriffe appears at least to rise to twenty-one degrees (16.8\r\ndegrees Reaumur); and the climate in those parts keeps at the\r\nmedium between the climate of Naples and that of the torrid zone.\r\n\r\nThe region of the vines exhibits, among its vegetable productions,\r\neight kinds of arborescent Euphorbia; Mesembrianthema, which are\r\nmultiplied from the Cape of Good Hope to the Peloponnesus; the\r\nCacalia Kleinia, the Dracaena, and other plants, which in their\r\nnaked and tortuous trunks, in their succulent leaves, and their\r\ntint of bluish green, exhibit distinctive marks of the vegetation\r\nof Africa. It is in this zone that the date-tree, the plantain, the\r\nsugar-cane, the Indian fig, the Arum Colocasia, the root of which\r\nfurnishes a nutritive fecula, the olive-tree, the fruit trees of\r\nEurope, the vine, and corn are cultivated. Corn is reaped from the\r\nend of March to the beginning of May: and the culture of the\r\nbread-fruit tree of Otaheite, that of the cinnamon tree of the\r\nMoluccas, the coffee-tree of Arabia, and the cacao-tree of America,\r\nhave been tried with success. On several points of the coast the\r\ncountry assumes the character of a tropical landscape; and we\r\nperceive that the region of the palms extends beyond the limits of\r\nthe torrid zone. The chamaerops and the date-tree flourish in the\r\nfertile plains of Murviedro, on the coasts of Genoa, and in\r\nProvence, near Antibes, between the thirty-ninth and forty-fourth\r\ndegrees of latitude; a few trees of the latter species, planted\r\nwithin the walls of the city of Rome, resist even the cold of 2.5\r\ndegrees below freezing point. But if the south of Europe as yet\r\nonly partially shares the gifts lavished by nature on the zone of\r\npalms, the island of Teneriffe, situated on the parallel of Egypt,\r\nsouthern Persia, and Florida, is adorned with the greater part of\r\nthe vegetable forms which add to the majesty of the landscape in\r\nthe regions near the equator.\r\n\r\nOn reviewing the different tribes of indigenous plants, we regret\r\nnot finding trees with small pinnated leaves, and arborescent\r\ngramina. No species of the numerous family of the sensitive-plants\r\nhas migrated as far as the archipelago of the Canary Islands, while\r\non both continents they have been seen in the thirty-eighth and\r\nfortieth degrees of latitude. On a more careful examination of the\r\nplants of the islands of Lancerota and Forteventura, which are\r\nnearest the coast of Morocco, we may perhaps find a few mimosas\r\namong many other plants of the African flora.\r\n\r\nThe second zone, that of the laurels, comprises the woody part of\r\nTeneriffe: this is the region of the springs, which gush forth\r\namidst turf always verdant, and never parched with drought. Lofty\r\nforests crown the hills leading to the volcano, and in them are\r\nfound four species of laurel,* (* Laurus indica, L. foetens, L.\r\nnobilis, and L. Til. With these trees are mingled the Ardisia\r\nexcelsa, Rhamnus glandulosus, Erica arborea and E. texo.) an oak\r\nnearly resembling the Quercus Turneri* (* Quercus canariensis,\r\nBroussonnet.) of the mountains of Tibet, the Visnea mocanera, the\r\nMyrica Faya of the Azores, a native olive (Olea excelsa), which is\r\nthe largest tree of this zone, two species of Sideroxylon, the\r\nleaves of which are extremely beautiful, the Arbutus callicarpa,\r\nand other evergreen trees of the family of myrtles. Bindweeds, and\r\nan ivy very different from that of Europe (Hedera canariensis)\r\nentwine the trunks of the laurels; at their feet vegetate a\r\nnumberless quantity of ferns,* (* Woodwardia radicans, Asplenium\r\npalmatum, A. canariensis, A. latifolium, Nothalaena subcordata,\r\nTrichomanes canariensis, T. speciosum, and Davallia canariensis.)\r\nof which three species* (* Two Acrostichums and the Ophyoglossum\r\nlusitanicum.) alone descend as low as the region of the vines. The\r\nsoil, covered with mosses and tender grass, is enriched with the\r\nflowers of the Campanula aurea, the Chrysanthemum pinnatifidum, the\r\nMentha canariensis, and several bushy species of Hypericum.* (*\r\nHypericum canariense, H. floribundum, and H. glandulosum.)\r\nPlantations of wild and grafted chestnut-trees form a broad border\r\nround the region of the springs, which is the greenest and most\r\nagreeable of the whole.\r\n\r\nIn the third zone (beginning at nine hundred toises of absolute\r\nheight), the last groups of Arbutus, of Myrica Faya, and of that\r\nbeautiful heath known to the natives by the name of Texo, appear.\r\nThis zone, four hundred toises in breadth, is entirely filled by a\r\nvast forest of pines, among which mingles the Juniperus cedro of\r\nBroussonnet. The leaves of these pines are very long and stiff, and\r\nthey sprout sometimes by pairs, but oftener by threes in one\r\nsheath. Having had no opportunity of examining the fructification,\r\nwe cannot say whether this species, which has the appearance of the\r\nScotch fir, is really different from the eighteen species of pines\r\nwith which we are already acquainted in Europe. M. Decandolle is of\r\nopinion that the pine of Teneriffe is equally distinct from the\r\nPinus atlantica of the neighbouring mountains of Mogador, and from\r\nthe pine of Aleppo,* (* Pinus halepensis. M. Decandolle observes,\r\nthat this species, which is not found in Portugal, but grows on the\r\nMediterranean shores of France, Spain, and Italy, in Asia Minor,\r\nand in Barbary, would be better named Pinus mediterranea. It\r\ncomposes the principal part of the pine-forests of the south-east\r\nof France, where Gouan and Gerard have confounded it with the Pinus\r\nsylvestris. It comprehends the Pinus halepensis, Mill., Lamb., and\r\nDesfont., and the Pinus maritima, Lamb.) which belongs to the basin\r\nof the Mediterranean, and does not appear to have passed the\r\nPillars of Hercules. We met with these last pines on the slope of\r\nthe Peak, near twelve hundred toises above the level of the sea. In\r\nthe Cordilleras of New Spain, under the torrid zone, the Mexican\r\npines extend to the height of two thousand toises. Notwithstanding\r\nthe similarity of structure existing between the different species\r\nof the same genus of plants, each of them requires a certain degree\r\nof temperature and rarity in the ambient air to attain its due\r\ngrowth. If in temperate climates, and wherever snow falls, the\r\nuniform heat of the soil be somewhat above the mean heat of the\r\natmosphere, it is probable that at the height of Portillo the roots\r\nof the pines draw their nourishment from a soil, in which, at a\r\ncertain depth, the thermometer rises at most to nine or ten\r\ndegrees.\r\n\r\nThe fourth and fifth zones, the regions of the retama and the\r\ngramina, occupy heights equal to the most inaccessible summits of\r\nthe Pyrenees. It is the sterile part of the island where heaps of\r\npumice-stone, obsidian, and broken lava, form impediments to\r\nvegetation. We have already spoken of those flowery tufts of alpine\r\nbroom (Spartium nubigenum), which form oases amidst a vast desert\r\nof ashes. Two herbaceous plants, the Scrophularia glabrata and the\r\nViola cheiranthifolia, advance even to the Malpays. Above a turf\r\nscorched by the heat of an African sun, an arid soil is overspread\r\nby the Cladonia paschalis. Towards the summit of the Peak the\r\nUrceolarea and other plants of the family of the lichens, help to\r\nwork the decomposition of the scorified matter. By this unceasing\r\naction of organic force the empire of Flora is extended over\r\nislands ravaged by volcanoes.\r\n\r\nOn surveying the different zones of the vegetation of Teneriffe, we\r\nperceive that the whole island may be considered as a forest of\r\nlaurels, arbutus, and pines, containing in its centre a naked and\r\nrocky soil, unfit either for pasturage or cultivation. M.\r\nBroussonnet observes, that the archipelago of the Canaries may be\r\ndivided into two groups of islands; the first comprising Lancerota\r\nand Forteventura, the second Teneriffe, Canary, Gomera, Ferro, and\r\nPalma. The appearance of the vegetation essentially differs in\r\nthese two groups. The eastern islands, Lancerota and Forteventura,\r\nconsist of extensive plains and mountains of little elevation; they\r\nhave very few springs, and bear the appearance, still more than the\r\nother islands, of having been separated from the continent. The\r\nwinds blow in the same direction, and at the same periods: the\r\nEuphorbia mauritanica, the Atropa frutescens, and the arborescent\r\nSonchus, vegetate there in the loose sands, and afford, as in\r\nAfrica, food for camels. The western group of the Canaries presents\r\na more elevated soil, is more woody, and is watered by a greater\r\nnumber of springs.\r\n\r\nThough the whole archipelago contains several plants found also in\r\nPortugal,* (* M. Willdenouw and myself found, among the plants of\r\nthe peak of Teneriffe, the beautiful Satyrium diphyllum (Orchis\r\ncordata, Willd.) which Mr. Link discovered in Portugal. The\r\nCanaries have, in common with the Flora of the Azores, not the\r\nDicksonia culcita, the only arborescent heath found at the\r\nthirty-ninth degree of latitude, but the Asplenium palmatum, and\r\nthe Myrica Faya. This last tree is met with in Portugal, in a wild\r\nstate. Count Hoffmansegg has seen very old trunks of it; but it was\r\ndoubtful whether it was indigenous, or imported into that part of\r\nour continent. In reflecting on the migrations of plants, and on\r\nthe geological possibility, that lands sunk in the ocean may have\r\nheretofore united Portugal, the Azores, the Canaries, and the chain\r\nof Atlas, we conceive, that the existence of the Myrica Faya in\r\nwestern Europe is a phenomenon at least as striking as that of the\r\npine of Aleppo would be at the Azores.), in Spain, at the Azores,\r\nand in the north-west of Africa, yet a great number of species, and\r\neven some genera, are peculiar to Teneriffe, to Porto Santo, and to\r\nMadeira. Such are the Mocanera, the Plocama, the Bosea, the\r\nCanarina, the Drusa, and the Pittosporum. A form which may be\r\ncalled northern, that of the cruciform plant (Among the small\r\nnumber of cruciform species contained in the Flora of Teneriffe, we\r\nshall here mention Cheiranthus longifolius, l'Herit.; Ch.\r\nfructescens, Vent.; Ch. scoparius, Brouss.; Erysimum bicorne,\r\nAiton; Crambe strigosa, and C. laevigata, Brouss.), is much rarer\r\nin the Canaries than in Spain and in Greece. Still farther to the\r\nsouth, in the equinoctial regions of both continents, where the\r\nmean temperature of the air rises above twenty-two degrees, the\r\ncruciform plants are scarcely ever to be seen.\r\n\r\nA question highly interesting to the history of the progressive\r\nmarks of organization on the globe has been very warmly discussed\r\nin our own times, that of ascertaining whether the polymorphous\r\nplants are more common in the volcanic islands. The vegetation of\r\nTeneriffe is unfavourable to the hypothesis that nature in new\r\ncountries is but little subject to permanent forms. M. Broussonnet,\r\nwho resided so long at the Canaries, asserts that the variable\r\nplants are not more common there than in the south of Europe. May\r\nit not to be presumed, that the polymorphous species, which are so\r\nabundant in the isle of Bourbon, are assignable to the nature of\r\nthe soil and climate rather than to the newness of the vegetation?\r\n\r\nBefore we take leave of the old world to pass into the new, I must\r\nadvert to a subject which is of general interest, because it\r\nbelongs to the history of man, and to those fatal revolutions which\r\nhave swept off whole tribes from the face of the earth. We inquire\r\nat the isle of Cuba, at St. Domingo, and in Jamaica, where is the\r\nabode of the primitive inhabitants of those countries? We ask at\r\nTeneriffe what is become of the Guanches, whose mummies alone,\r\nburied in caverns, have escaped destruction? In the fifteenth\r\ncentury almost all mercantile nations, especially the Spaniards and\r\nthe Portuguese, sought for slaves at the Canary Islands, as in\r\nlater times they have been sought on the coast of Guinea.* (* The\r\nSpanish historians speak of expeditions made by the Huguenots of\r\nRochelle to carry off Guanche slaves. I have some doubt respecting\r\nthese expeditions, which are said to have taken place subsequently\r\nto the year 1530.) The Christian religion, which in its origin was\r\nso highly favourable to the liberty of mankind, served afterwards\r\nas a pretext to the cupidity of Europeans. Every individual, made\r\nprisoner before he received the rite of baptism, became a slave. At\r\nthat period no attempt had yet been made to prove that the blacks\r\nwere an intermediate race between man and animals. The swarthy\r\nGuanche and the African negro were simultaneously sold in the\r\nmarket of Seville, without a question whether slavery should be the\r\ndoom only of men with black skins and woolly hair.\r\n\r\nThe archipelago of the Canaries was divided into several small\r\nstates hostile to each other, and in many instances the same island\r\nwas subject to two independent princes. The trading nations,\r\ninfluenced by the hideous policy still exercised on the coast of\r\nAfrica, kept up intestine warfare. One Guanche then became the\r\nproperty of another, who sold him to the Europeans; several, who\r\npreferred death to slavery, killed themselves and their children.\r\nThe population of the Canaries had considerably suffered by the\r\nslave trade, by the depredations of pirates, and especially by a\r\nlong period of carnage, when Alonzo de Lugo completed the conquest\r\nof the Guanches. The surviving remnants of the race perished mostly\r\nin 1494, in the terrible pestilence called the modorra, which was\r\nattributed to the quantity of dead bodies left exposed in the open\r\nair by the Spaniards after the battle of La Laguna. The nation of\r\nthe Guanches was extinct at the beginning of the seventeenth\r\ncentury; a few old men only were found at Candelaria and Guimar.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, consoling to find that the whites have not always\r\ndisdained to intermarry with the natives; but the Canarians of the\r\npresent day, whom the Spaniards familiarly call Islenos\r\n(Islanders), have very powerful motives for denying this mixture.\r\nIn a long series of generations time effaces the characteristic\r\nmarks of a race; and as the descendants of the Andalusians settled\r\nat Teneriffe are themselves of dark complexion, we may conceive\r\nthat intermarriages cannot have produced a perceptible change in\r\nthe colour of the whites. It is very certain that no native of pure\r\nrace exists in the whole island. It is true that a few Canarian\r\nfamilies boast of their relationship to the last shepherd-king of\r\nGuimar, but these pretensions do not rest on very solid\r\nfoundations, and are only renewed from time to time when some\r\nCanarian of more dusky hue than his countrymen is prompted to\r\nsolicit a commission in the service of the king of Spain.\r\n\r\nA short time after the discovery of America, when Spain was at the\r\nhighest pinnacle of her glory, the gentle character of the Guanches\r\nwas the fashionable topic, as we in our times laud the Arcadian\r\ninnocence of the inhabitants of Otaheite. In both these pictures\r\nthe colouring is more vivid than true. When nations, wearied with\r\nmental enjoyments, behold nothing in the refinement of manners but\r\nthe germ of depravity, they are pleased with the idea, that in some\r\ndistant region, in the first dawn of civilization, infant society\r\nenjoys pure and perpetual felicity. To this sentiment Tacitus owed\r\na part of his success, when he sketched for the Romans, subjects of\r\nthe Caesars, a picture of the manners of the inhabitants of\r\nGermany. The same sentiment gives an ineffable charm to the\r\nnarrative of those travellers who, at the close of the last\r\ncentury, visited the South Sea Islands.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of those islands, too much vaunted (and previously\r\nanthropophagi), resemble, under more than one point of view, the\r\nGuanches of Teneriffe. Both nations were under the yoke of feudal\r\ngovernment. Among the Guanches, this institution, which facilitates\r\nand renders a state of warfare perpetual, was sanctioned by\r\nreligion. The priests declared to the people: \"The great Spirit,\r\nAchaman, created first the nobles, the achimenceys, to whom he\r\ndistributed all the goats that exist on the face of the earth.\r\nAfter the nobles, Achaman created the plebeians, achicaxnas. This\r\nyounger race had the boldness to petition also for goats; but the\r\nsupreme Spirit answered, that this race was destined to serve the\r\nnobles, and that they had need of no property.\" This tradition was\r\nmade, no doubt, to please the rich vassals of the shepherd-kings.\r\nThe faycan, or high priest, also exercised the right of conferring\r\nnobility; and the law of the Guanches expressed that every\r\nachimencey who degraded himself by milking a goat with his own\r\nhands, lost his claim to nobility. This law does not remind us of\r\nthe simplicity of the Homeric age. We are astonished to see the\r\nuseful labours of agriculture, and of pastoral life, exposed to\r\ncontempt at the very dawn of civilization.\r\n\r\nThe Guanches, famed for their tall stature, were the Patagonians of\r\nthe old world. Historians exaggerated the muscular strength of the\r\nGuanches, as, previous to the voyage of Bougainville and Cordoba,\r\ncolossal proportions were attributed to the tribe that inhabited\r\nthe southern extremity of America. I never saw Guanche mummies but\r\nin the cabinets of Europe. At the time I visited the Canaries they\r\nwere very scarce; a considerable number, however, might be found if\r\nminers were employed to open the sepulchral caverns which are cut\r\nin the rock on the eastern slope of the Peak, between Arico and\r\nGuimar. These mummies are in a state of desiccation so singular,\r\nthat whole bodies, with their integuments, frequently do not weigh\r\nabove six or seven pounds; or a third less than the skeleton of an\r\nindividual of the same size, recently stripped of the muscular\r\nflesh. The conformation of the skull has some slight resemblance to\r\nthat of the white race of the ancient Egyptians; and the incisive\r\nteeth of the Guanches are blunted, like those of the mummies found\r\non the banks of the Nile. But this form of teeth is the result of\r\nart; and on examining more carefully the physiognomy of the ancient\r\nCanarians, Blumenbach and other able anatomists have recognized in\r\nthe cheek bones and the lower jaw perceptible differences from the\r\nEgyptian mummies. On opening those of the Guanches, remains of\r\naromatic plants are discovered, among which the Chenopodium\r\nambrosioides is constantly perceived: the bodies are often\r\ndecorated with small laces, to which are hung little discs of baked\r\nearth, which appear to have served as numerical signs, and resemble\r\nthe quippoes of the Peruvians, the Mexicans, and the Chinese.\r\n\r\nThe population of islands being in general less exposed than that\r\nof continents to the effect of migrations, we may presume that, in\r\nthe time of the Carthaginians and the Greeks, the archipelago of\r\nthe Canaries was inhabited by the same race of men as were found by\r\nthe Norman and Spanish conquerors. The only monument that can throw\r\nany light on the origin of the Guanches is their language; but\r\nunhappily there are not above a hundred and fifty words extant, and\r\nseveral express the same object, according to the dialect of the\r\ndifferent islanders. Independently of these words, which have been\r\ncarefully noted, there are still some valuable fragments existing\r\nin the names of a great number of hamlets, hills, and valleys. The\r\nGuanches, like the Biscayans, the Hindoos, the Peruvians, and all\r\nprimitive nations, named places after the quality of the soil, the\r\nshape of the rocks, the caverns that gave them shelter, and the\r\nnature of the tree that overshadowed the springs.*\r\n\r\n(* It has been long imagined, that the language of the Guanches had\r\nno analogy with the living tongues; but since the travels of\r\nHornemann, and the ingenious researches of Marsden and Venturi,\r\nhave drawn the attention of the learned to the Berbers, who, like\r\nthe Sarmatic tribes, occupy an immense extent of country in the\r\nnorth of Africa, we find that several Guanche words have common\r\nroots with words of the Chilha and Gebali dialects. We shall cite,\r\nfor instance, the words:\r\n\r\nTABLE OF WORDS.\r\n\r\nColumn 1: Word.\r\n\r\nColumn 2: In Guanche.\r\n\r\nColumn 3: In Berberic.\r\n\r\n  Heaven : Tigo     : Tigot.\r\n  Milk   : Aho      : Acho.\r\n  Barley : Temasen  : Tomzeen.\r\n  Basket : Carianas : Carian.\r\n  Water  : Aenum    : Anan.\r\n\r\nI doubt whether this analogy is a proof of a common origin; but it\r\nis an indication of the ancient connexion between the Guanches and\r\nBerbers, a tribe of mountaineers, in which the ancient Numidians,\r\nGetuli, and Garamanti are confounded, and who extend themselves\r\nfrom the eastern extremity of Atlas by Harutsh and Fezzan, as far\r\nas the oasis of Siwah and Augela. The natives of the Canary Islands\r\ncalled themselves Guanches, from guan, man; as the Tonguese call\r\nthemselves bye, and tongui, which have the same signification as\r\nguan. Besides the nations who speak the Berberic language are not\r\nall of the same race; and the description which Scylax gives, in\r\nhis Periplus, of the inhabitants of Cerne, a shepherd people of\r\ntall stature and long hair, reminds us of the features which\r\ncharacterize the Canarian Guanches.)\r\n\r\nThe greater attention we direct to the study of languages in a\r\nphilosophical point of view, the more we must observe that no one\r\nof them is entirely distinct. The language of the Guanches would\r\nappear still less so, had we any data respecting its mechanism and\r\ngrammatical construction; two elements more important than the form\r\nof words, and the identity of sounds. It is the same with certain\r\nidioms, as with those organized beings that seem to shrink from all\r\nclassification in the series of natural families. Their isolated\r\nstate is merely apparent; for it ceases when, on embracing a\r\ngreater number of objects, we come to discover the intermediate\r\nlinks. Those learned enquirers who trace Egyptians wherever there\r\nare mummies, hieroglyphics, or pyramids, will imagine perhaps that\r\nthe race of Typhon was united to the Guanches by the Berbers, real\r\nAtlantes, to whom belong the Tibboes and the Tuarycks of the\r\ndesert: but this hypothesis is supported by no analogy between the\r\nBerberic and Coptic languages, which are justly considered as\r\nremnants of the ancient Egyptian.\r\n\r\nThe people who have succeeded the Guanches are descended from the\r\nSpaniards, and in a more remote degree from the Normans. Though\r\nthese two races have been exposed during three centuries past to\r\nthe same climate, the latter is distinguished by the fairer\r\ncomplexion. The descendants of the Normans inhabit the valley of\r\nTeganana, between Punta de Naga and Punta de Hidalgo. The names of\r\nGrandville and Dampierre are still pretty common in this district.\r\nThe Canarians are a moral, sober, and religious people, of a less\r\nindustrious character at home than in foreign countries. A roving\r\nand enterprising disposition leads these islanders, like the\r\nBiscayans and Catalonians, to the Philippines, to the Ladrone\r\nIslands, to America, and wherever there are Spanish settlements,\r\nfrom Chile and La Plata to New Mexico. To them we are in a great\r\nmeasure indebted for the progress of agriculture in those colonies.\r\nThe whole archipelago does not contain 160,030 inhabitants, and the\r\nIslenos are perhaps more numerous in the new continent than in\r\ntheir own country.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.3.\r\n\r\nPASSAGE FROM TENERIFE TO SOUTH AMERICA.\r\nTHE ISLAND OF TOBAGO.\r\nARRIVAL AT CUMANA.\r\n\r\nWe left the road of Santa Cruz on the 25th of June, and directed\r\nour course towards South America. We soon lost sight of the Canary\r\nIslands, the lofty mountains of which were covered with a reddish\r\nvapour. The Peak alone appeared from time to time, as at intervals\r\nthe wind dispersed the clouds that enveloped the Piton. We felt,\r\nfor the first time, how strong are the impressions left on the mind\r\nfrom the aspect of those countries situated on the limits of the\r\ntorrid zone, where nature appears at once so rich, so various, and\r\nso majestic. Our stay at Teneriffe had been very short, and yet we\r\nwithdrew from the island as if it had long been our home.\r\n\r\nOur passage from Santa Cruz to Cumana, the most eastern part of the\r\nNew Continent, was very fine. We cut the tropic of Cancer on the\r\n27th; and though the Pizarro was not a very fast sailer, we made,\r\nin twenty days, the nine hundred leagues, which separate the coast\r\nof Africa from that of the New Continent. We passed fifty leagues\r\nwest of Cape Bojador, Cape Blanco, and the Cape Verd islands. A few\r\nland birds, which had been driven to sea by the impetuosity of the\r\nwind followed us for several days.\r\n\r\nThe latitude diminished rapidly, from the parallel of Madeira to\r\nthe tropic. When we reached the zone where the trade-winds are\r\nconstant, we crossed the ocean from east to west, on a calm sea,\r\nwhich the Spanish sailors call the Ladies' Gulf, el Golfo de las\r\nDamas. In proportion as we advanced towards the west, we found the\r\ntrade-winds fix to eastward.\r\n\r\nThese winds, the most generally adopted theory of which is\r\nexplained in a celebrated treatise of Halley,* are a phenomenon\r\nmuch more complicated than most persons admit. (* The existence of\r\nan upper current of air, which blows constantly from the equator to\r\nthe poles, and of a lower current, which blows from the poles to\r\nthe equator, had already been admitted, as M. Arago has shown, by\r\nHooke. The ideas of the celebrated English naturalist are developed\r\nin a Discourse on Earthquakes published in 1686. \"I think (adds he)\r\nthat several phenomena, which are presented by the atmosphere and\r\nthe ocean, especially the winds, may be explained by the polar\r\ncurrents.\"--Hooke's Posthumous Works page 364.) In the Atlantic\r\nOcean, the longitude, as well as the declination of the sun,\r\ninfluences the direction and limits of the trade-winds. In the\r\ndirection of the New Continent, in both hemispheres, these limits\r\nextend beyond the tropics eight or nine degrees; while in the\r\nvicinity of Africa, the variable winds prevail far beyond the\r\nparallel of 28 or 27 degrees. It is to be regretted, on account of\r\nthe progress of meteorology and navigation, that the changes of the\r\ncurrents of the equinoctial atmosphere in the Pacific are much less\r\nknown than the variation of these same currents in a sea that is\r\nnarrower, and influenced by the proximity of the coasts of Guinea\r\nand Brazil. The difference with which the strata of air flow back\r\nfrom the two poles towards the equator cannot be the same in every\r\ndegree of longitude, that is to say, on points of the globe where\r\nthe continents are of very different breadths, and where they\r\nstretch away more or less towards the poles.\r\n\r\nIt is known, that in the passage from Santa Cruz to Cumana, as in\r\nthat from Acapulco to the Philippine Islands, seamen are scarcely\r\never under the necessity of working their sails. We pass those\r\nlatitudes as if we were descending a river, and we might deem it no\r\nhazardous undertaking if we made the voyage in an open boat.\r\nFarther west, on the coast of Santa Martha and in the Gulf of\r\nMexico, the trade-wind blows impetuously, and renders the sea very\r\nstormy.* (* The Spanish sailors call the rough trade-winds at\r\nCarthagena in the West Indies los brisotes de Santa Martha; and in\r\nthe Gulf of Mexico, las brizas pardas. These latter winds are\r\naccompanied with a grey and cloudy sky.)\r\n\r\nThe wind fell gradually the farther we receded from the African\r\ncoast: it was sometimes smooth water for several hours, and these\r\nshort calms were regularly interrupted by electrical phenomena.\r\nBlack thick clouds, marked by strong outlines, rose on the east,\r\nand it seemed as if a squall would have forced us to hand our\r\ntopsails; but the breeze freshened anew, there fell a few large\r\ndrops of rain, and the storm dispersed without our hearing any\r\nthunder. Meanwhile it was curious to observe the effect of several\r\nblack, isolated, and very low clouds, which passed the zenith. We\r\nfelt the force of the wind augment or diminish progressively,\r\naccording as small bodies of vesicular vapour approached or\r\nreceded, while the electrometers, furnished with a long metallic\r\nrod and lighted match, showed no change of electric tension in the\r\nlower strata of the air. It is by help of these squalls, which\r\nalternate with dead calms, that the passage from the Canary Islands\r\nto the Antilles, or southern coast of America, is made in the\r\nmonths of June and July.\r\n\r\nSome Spanish navigators have lately proposed going to the West\r\nIndies and the coasts of Terra Firma by a course different from\r\nthat which was taken by Columbus. They advise, instead of steering\r\ndirectly to the south in search of the trade-winds, to change both\r\nlatitude and longitude, in a diagonal line from Cape St. Vincent to\r\nAmerica. This method, which shortens the way, cutting the tropic\r\nnearly twenty degrees west of the point where it is commonly cut by\r\npilots, was several times successfully adopted by Admiral Gravina.\r\nThat able commander, who fell at the battle of Trafalgar, arrived\r\nin 1802 at St. Domingo, by the oblique passage, several days before\r\nthe French fleet, though orders of the court of Madrid would have\r\nforced him to enter Ferrol with his squadron, and stop there some\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThis new system of navigation shortens the passage from Cadiz to\r\nCumana one-twentieth; but as the tropic is attained only at the\r\nlongitude of forty degrees, the chance of meeting with contrary\r\nwinds, which blow sometimes from the south, and at other times from\r\nthe south-west, is more unfavourable. In the old system, the\r\ndisadvantage of making a longer passage is compensated by the\r\ncertainty of catching the trade-winds in a shorter space of time,\r\nand keeping them the greater part of the passage. At the time of my\r\nabode in the Spanish colonies, I witnessed the arrival of several\r\nmerchant-ships, which from the fear of privateers had chosen the\r\noblique course, and had had a very short passage.\r\n\r\nNothing can equal the beauty and mildness of the climate of the\r\nequinoctial region on the ocean. While the trade wind blew\r\nstrongly, the thermometer kept at 23 or 24 degrees in the day, and\r\nat 22 or 22.5 degrees during the night. The charm of the lovely\r\nclimates bordering on the equator, can be fully enjoyed only by\r\nthose who have undertaken the voyage from Acapulco or the coasts of\r\nChile to Europe in a very rough season. What a contrast between the\r\ntempestuous seas of the northern latitudes and the regions where\r\nthe tranquillity of nature is never disturbed! If the return from\r\nMexico or South America to the coasts of Spain were as expeditious\r\nand as agreeable as the passage from the old to the new continent,\r\nthe number of Europeans settled in the colonies would be much less\r\nconsiderable than it is at present. To the sea which surrounds the\r\nAzores and the Bermuda Islands, and which is traversed in returning\r\nto Europe by the high latitudes, the Spaniards have given the\r\nsingular name of Golfo de las Yeguas (the Mares' Gulf). Colonists\r\nwho are not accustomed to the sea, and who have led solitary lives\r\nin the forests of Guiana, the savannahs of the Caracas, or the\r\nCordilleras of Peru, dread the vicinity of the Bermudas more than\r\nthe inhabitants of Lima fear at present the passage round Cape\r\nhorn.\r\n\r\nTo the north of the Cape Verd Islands we met with great masses of\r\nfloating seaweeds. They were the tropic grape, (Fucus natans),\r\nwhich grows on submarine rocks, only from the equator to the\r\nfortieth degree of north and south latitude. These weeds seem to\r\nindicate the existence of currents in this place, as well as to\r\nsouth-west of the banks of Newfoundland. We must not confound the\r\nlatitudes abounding in scattered weeds with those banks of marine\r\nplants, which Columbus compares to extensive meadows, the sight of\r\nwhich dismayed the crew of the Santa Maria in the forty-second\r\ndegree of longitude. I am convinced, from the comparison of a great\r\nnumber of journals, that in the basin of the Northern Atlantic\r\nthere exist two banks of weeds very different from each other. The\r\nmost extensive is a little west of the meridian of Fayal, one of\r\nthe Azores, between the twenty-fifth and thirty-sixth degrees of\r\nlatitude.* (* It would appear that Phoenician vessels came \"in\r\nthirty days' sail, with an easterly wind,\" to the weedy sea, which\r\nthe Portuguese and Spaniards call mar de zargasso. I have shown, in\r\nanother place (Views of Nature Bohn's edition page 46), that the\r\npassage of Aristotle, De Mirabil. (ed. Duval page 1157), can\r\nscarcely be applied to the coasts of Africa, like an analogous\r\npassage of the Periplus of Scylax. Supposing that this sea, full of\r\nweeds, which impeded the course of the Phoenician vessels, was the\r\nmar de zargasso, we need not admit that the ancients navigated the\r\nAtlantic beyond thirty degrees of west longitude from the meridian\r\nof Paris.) The temperature of the Atlantic in those latitudes is\r\nfrom sixteen to twenty degrees, and the north winds, which\r\nsometimes rage there very tempestuously, drive floating isles of\r\nseaweed into the low latitudes as far as the parallels of\r\ntwenty-four and even twenty degrees. Vessels returning to Europe,\r\neither from Monte Video or the Cape of Good Hope, cross these banks\r\nof Fucus, which the Spanish pilots consider as at an equal distance\r\nfrom the Antilles and Canaries; and they serve the less instructed\r\nmariner to rectify his longitude. The second bank of Fucus is but\r\nlittle known; it occupies a much smaller space, in the\r\ntwenty-second and twenty-sixth degrees of latitude, eighty leagues\r\nwest of the meridian of the Bahama Islands. It is found on the\r\npassage from the Caiques to the Bermudas.\r\n\r\nThough a species of seaweed* (* The baudreux of the Falkland\r\nIslands; Fucus giganteus, Forster; Laminaria pyrifera, Lamour.) has\r\nbeen seen with stems eight hundred feet long, the growth of these\r\nmarine cryptogamia being extremely rapid, it is nevertheless\r\ncertain, that in the latitudes we have just described, the Fuci,\r\nfar from being fixed to the bottom, float in separate masses on the\r\nsurface of the water. In this state, the vegetation can scarcely\r\nlast longer than it would in the branch of a tree torn from its\r\ntrunk; and in order to explain how moving masses are found for ages\r\nin the same position, we must admit that they owe their origin to\r\nsubmarine rocks, which, lying at forty or sixty fathoms' depth,\r\ncontinually supply what has been carried away by the equinoctial\r\ncurrents. This current bears the tropic grape into the high\r\nlatitudes, toward the coasts of Norway and France; and it is not\r\nthe Gulf-stream, as some mariners think, which accumulates the\r\nFucus to the south of the Azores.\r\n\r\nThe causes that unroot these weeds at depths where it is generally\r\nthought the sea is but slightly agitated, are not sufficiently\r\nknown. We learn only, from the observations of M. Lamouroux, that\r\nif the fucus adhere to the rocks with the greatest firmness before\r\nits fructification, it separates with great facility after that\r\nperiod, or during the season which suspends its vegetation like\r\nthat of the terrestrial plants. The fish and mollusca which gnaw\r\nthe stems of the seaweeds no doubt contribute also to detach them\r\nfrom their roots.\r\n\r\nFrom the twenty-second degree of latitude, we found the surface of\r\nthe sea covered with flying-fish,* (* Exocoetus volitans.) which\r\nthrew themselves up into the air, twelve, fifteen, or eighteen\r\nfeet, and fell down on the deck. I do not hesitate to speak on a\r\nsubject of which voyagers discourse as frequently as of dolphins,\r\nsharks, sea-sickness, and the phosphorescence of the ocean. None of\r\nthese topics can fail to afford interesting observations to\r\nnaturalists, provided they make them their particular study. Nature\r\nis an inexhaustible source of investigation, and in proportion as\r\nthe domain of science is extended, she presents herself to those\r\nwho know how to interrogate her, under forms which they have never\r\nyet examined.\r\n\r\nI have named the flying-fish, in order to direct the attention of\r\nnaturalists to the enormous size of their natatory bladder, which,\r\nin an animal of 6.4 inches, is 3.6 inches long, 0.9 of an inch\r\nbroad, and contains three cubic inches and a half of air. As this\r\nbladder occupies more than half the size of the fish, it is\r\nprobable that it contributes to its lightness. We may assert that\r\nthis reservoir of air is more fitted for flying than swimming; for\r\nthe experiments made by M. Provenzal and myself have proved, that,\r\neven in the species which are provided with this organ, it is not\r\nindispensably necessary for the ascending movement to the surface\r\nof the water. In a young flying-fish, 5.8 inches long, each of the\r\npectoral fins, which serve as wings, presented a surface to the air\r\nof 3 7/16 square inches. We observed, that the nine branches of\r\nnerves, which go to the twelve rays of these fins, are almost three\r\ntimes the size of the nerves that belong to the ventral fins. When\r\nthe former of these nerves are excited by galvanic electricity, the\r\nrays which support the membrane of the pectoral fin extend with\r\nfive times the force with which the other fins move when galvanised\r\nby the same metals. Thus, the fish is capable of throwing itself\r\nhorizontally the distance of twenty feet before retouching the\r\nwater with the extremity of its fins. This motion has been aptly\r\ncompared to that of a flat stone, which, thrown horizontally,\r\nbounds one or two feet above the water. Notwithstanding the extreme\r\nrapidity of this motion, it is certain, that the animal beats the\r\nair during the leap; that is, it alternately extends and closes its\r\npectoral fins. The same motion has been observed in the flying\r\nscorpion of the rivers of Japan: they also contain a large\r\nair-bladder, with which the great part of the scorpions that have\r\nnot the faculty of flying are unprovided. The flying-fish, like\r\nalmost all animals which have gills, enjoy the power of equal\r\nrespiration for a long time, both in water and in air, by the same\r\norgans; that is, by extracting the oxygen from the atmosphere as\r\nwell as from the water in which it is dissolved. They pass a great\r\npart of their life in the air; but if they escape from the sea to\r\navoid the voracity of the Dorado, they meet in the air the\r\nFrigate-bird, the Albatross, and others, which seize them in their\r\nflight. Thus, on the banks of the Orinoco, herds of the Cabiai,\r\nwhich rush from the water to escape the crocodile, become the prey\r\nof the jaguar, which awaits their arrival.\r\n\r\nI doubt, however, whether the flying-fish spring out of the water\r\nmerely to escape the pursuit of their enemies. Like swallows, they\r\nmove by thousands in a right line, and in a direction constantly\r\nopposite to that of the waves. In our own climates, on the brink of\r\na river, illumined by the rays of the sun, we often see solitary\r\nfish fearlessly bound above the surface as if they felt pleasure in\r\nbreathing the air. Why should not these gambols be more frequent\r\nwith the flying-fish, which from the strength of their pectoral\r\nfins, and the smallness of their specific gravity, can so easily\r\nsupport themselves in the air? I invite naturalists to examine\r\nwhether other flying-fish, for instance the Exocoetus exiliens, the\r\nTrigla volitans, amid the T. hirundo, have as capacious an\r\nair-bladder as the flying-fish of the tropics. This last follows\r\nthe heated waters of the Gulf-stream when they flow northward. The\r\ncabin-boys amuse themselves with cutting off a part of the pectoral\r\nfins, and assert, that these wings grow again; which seems to me\r\nnot unlikely, from facts observed in other families of fishes.\r\n\r\nAt the time I left Paris, experiments made at Jamaica by Dr.\r\nBrodbelt, on the air contained in the natatory bladder of the\r\nsword-fish, had led some naturalists to think, that within the\r\ntropics, in sea-fish, that organ must be filled with pure oxygen\r\ngas. Full of this idea, I was surprised at finding in the\r\nair-bladder of the flying-fish only 0.04 of oxygen to 0.94 of azote\r\nand 0.02 of carbonic acid. The proportion of this last gas,\r\nmeasured by the absorption of lime-water in graduated tubes,\r\nappeared more uniform than that of the oxygen, of which some\r\nindividuals yielded almost double the quantity. From the curious\r\nphenomena observed by MM. Biot, Configliachi, and Delaroche, we\r\nmight suppose, that the swordfish dissected by Dr. Brodbelt had\r\ninhabited the lower strata of the ocean, where some fish* have as\r\nmuch as 0.92 of oxygen in the air-bladder. (* Trigla cucullus.)\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd and 4th of July, we crossed that part of the Atlantic\r\nwhere the charts indicate the bank of the Maal-stroom; and towards\r\nnight we altered our course to avoid the danger, the existence of\r\nwhich is, however, as doubtful as that of the isles Fonseco and St.\r\nAnne. It would have been perhaps as prudent to have continued our\r\ncourse. The old charts are filled with rocks, some of which really\r\nexist, though most of them are merely the offspring of those\r\noptical illusions which are more frequent at sea than in inland\r\nplaces. As we approached the supposed Maal-stroom, we observed no\r\nother motion in the waters than the effect of a current which bore\r\nto the north-west, and which hindered us from diminishing our\r\nlatitude as much as we wished. The force of this current augments\r\nas we approach the new continent; it is modified by the\r\nconfiguration of the coasts of Brazil and Guiana, and not by the\r\nwaters of the Orinoco and the Amazon, as some have supposed.\r\n\r\nFrom the time we entered the torrid zone, we were never weary of\r\nadmiring, at night, the beauty of the southern sky, which, as we\r\nadvanced to the south, opened new constellations to our view. We\r\nfeel an indescribable sensation when, on approaching the equator,\r\nand particularly on passing from one hemisphere to the other, we\r\nsee those stars, which we have contemplated from our infancy,\r\nprogressively sink, and finally disappear. Nothing awakens in the\r\ntraveller a livelier remembrance of the immense distance by which\r\nhe is separated from his country, than the aspect of an unknown\r\nfirmament. The grouping of the stars of the first magnitude, some\r\nscattered nebulae, rivalling in splendour the milky way, and tracts\r\nof space remarkable for their extreme blackness, give a peculiar\r\nphysiognomy to the southern sky. This sight fills with admiration\r\neven those who, uninstructed in the several branches of physical\r\nscience, feel the same emotion of delight in the contemplation of\r\nthe heavenly vault, as in the view of a beautiful landscape, or a\r\nmajestic site. A traveller needs not to be a botanist, to recognize\r\nthe torrid zone by the mere aspect of its vegetation. Without\r\nhaving acquired any notions of astronomy, without any acquaintance\r\nwith the celestial charts of Flamsteed and De La Caille, he feels\r\nhe is not in Europe, when he sees the immense constellation of the\r\nShip, or the phosphorescent Clouds of Magellan, arise on the\r\nhorizon. The heavens and the earth,--everything in the equinoctial\r\nregions, presents an exotic character.\r\n\r\nThe lower regions of the air were loaded with vapours for some\r\ndays. We saw distinctly for the first time the Southern Cross only\r\non the night of the 4th of July, in the sixteenth degree of\r\nlatitude. It was strongly inclined, and appeared from time to time\r\nbetween the clouds, the centre of which, furrowed by uncondensed\r\nlightnings, reflected a silvery light. If a traveller may be\r\npermitted to speak of his personal emotions, I shall add, that on\r\nthat night I experienced the realization of one of the dreams of my\r\nearly youth.\r\n\r\nWhen we begin to fix our eyes on geographical maps, and to read the\r\nnarratives of navigators, we feel for certain countries and\r\nclimates a sort of predilection, which we know not how to account\r\nfor at a more advanced period of life. These impressions, however,\r\nexercise a considerable influence over our determinations; and from\r\na sort of instinct we endeavour to connect ourselves with objects\r\non which the mind has long been fixed as by a secret charm. At a\r\nperiod when I studied the heavens, not with the intention of\r\ndevoting myself to astronomy, but only to acquire a knowledge of\r\nthe stars, I was disturbed by a feeling unknown to those who are\r\ndevoted to sedentary life. It was painful to me to renounce the\r\nhope of beholding the beautiful constellations near the south pole.\r\nImpatient to rove in the equinoctial regions, I could not raise my\r\neyes to the starry firmament without thinking of the Southern\r\nCross, and recalling the sublime passage of Dante, which the most\r\ncelebrated commentators have applied to that constellation:--\r\n\r\n    Io mi volsi a man' destra e posi mente\r\n    All' altro polo, e vidi quattro stelle\r\n    Non viste mai fuorch' alla prima gente.\r\n\r\n    Goder parea lo ciel di lor fiammelle;\r\n    O settentrional vedovo sito\r\n    Poiche privato sei di mirar quelle!\r\n\r\nThe pleasure we felt on discovering the Southern Cross was warmly\r\nshared by those of the crew who had visited the colonies. In the\r\nsolitude of the seas we hail a star as a friend, from whom we have\r\nlong been separated. The Portuguese and the Spaniards are\r\npeculiarly susceptible of this feeling; a religious sentiment\r\nattaches them to a constellation, the form of which recalls the\r\nsign of the faith planted by their ancestors in the deserts of the\r\nNew World.\r\n\r\nThe two great stars which mark the summit and the foot of the Cross\r\nhaving nearly the same right ascension, it follows that the\r\nconstellation is almost perpendicular at the moment when it passes\r\nthe meridian. This circumstance is known to the people of every\r\nnation situated beyond the tropics, or in the southern hemisphere.\r\nIt has been observed at what hour of the night, in different\r\nseasons, the Cross is erect or inclined. It is a timepiece which\r\nadvances very regularly nearly four minutes a-day, and no other\r\ngroup of stars affords to the naked eye an observation of time so\r\neasily made. How often have we heard our guides exclaim in the\r\nsavannahs of Venezuela, or in the desert extending from Lima to\r\nTruxillo, \"Midnight is past, the Cross begins to bend!\" How often\r\nthose words reminded us of that affecting scene, where Paul and\r\nVirginia, seated near the source of the river of Lataniers,\r\nconversed together for the last time, and where the old man, at the\r\nsight of the Southern Cross, warns them that it is time to\r\nseparate.\r\n\r\nThe last days of our passage were not so felicitous as the mildness\r\nof the climate and the calmness of the ocean had led us to hope.\r\nThe dangers of the sea did not disturb us, but the germs of a\r\nmalignant fever became manifest on board our vessel as we drew near\r\nthe Antilles. Between decks the ship was excessively hot, and very\r\nmuch crowded. From the time we passed the tropic, the thermometer\r\nwas at thirty-four or thirty-six degrees. Two sailors, several\r\npassengers, and, what is remarkable enough, two negroes from the\r\ncoast of Guinea, and a mulatto child, were attacked with a disorder\r\nwhich appeared to be epidemic. The symptoms were not equally\r\nalarming in all the cases; nevertheless, several persons, and\r\nespecially the most robust, fell into delirium after the second\r\nday. No fumigation was made. A Gallician surgeon, ignorant and\r\nphlegmatic, ordered bleedings, because he attributed the fever to\r\nwhat he called heat and corruption of the blood. There was not an\r\nounce of bark on board; for we had emitted to take any with us,\r\nunder the impression that this salutary production of Peru could\r\nnot fail to be found on board a Spanish vessel.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of July, a sailor, who was near expiring, recovered his\r\nhealth from a circumstance worthy of being mentioned. His hammock\r\nwas so hung, that there was not ten inches between his face and the\r\ndeck. It was impossible to administer the sacrament in this\r\nsituation; for, agreeably to the custom on board Spanish vessels,\r\nthe viaticum must be carried by the light of tapers, and followed\r\nby the whole crew. The patient was removed into an airy place near\r\nthe hatchway, where a small square berth had been formed with\r\nsailcloth. Here he was to remain till he died, which was an event\r\nexpected every moment; but passing from an atmosphere heated,\r\nstagnant, and filled with miasma, into fresher and purer air, which\r\nwas renewed every instant, he gradually revived from his lethargic\r\nstate. His recovery dated from the day when he quitted the middle\r\ndeck; and as it often happens in medicine that the same facts are\r\ncited in support of systems diametrically opposite, this recovery\r\nconfirmed our doctor in his idea of the inflammation of the blood,\r\nand the necessity of bleeding, evacuating, and all the asthenic\r\nremedies. We soon felt the fatal effects of this treatment.\r\n\r\nFor several days the pilot's reckoning differed 1 degree 12 minutes\r\nin longitude from that of my time. This difference was owing less\r\nto the general current, which I have called the current of\r\nrotation, than to that particular movement, which, drawing the\r\nwaters toward the north-west, from the coast of Brazil to the\r\nAntilles, shortens the passage from Cayenne to Guadaloupe.* (* In\r\nthe Atlantic Ocean there is a space where the water is constantly\r\nmilky, though the sea is very deep. This curious phenomenon exists\r\nin the parallel of the island of Dominica, very near the 57th\r\ndegree of longitude. May there not be in this place some sunken\r\nvolcanic islet, more easterly still than Barbadoes?) On the 12th of\r\nJuly, I thought I might foretell our seeing land next day before\r\nsunrise. We were then, according to my observations, in latitude 10\r\ndegrees 46 minutes, and west longitude 60 degrees 54 minutes. A few\r\nseries of lunar distances confirmed the chronometrical result; but\r\nwe were surer of the position of the vessel, than of that of the\r\nland to which we were directing our course, and which was so\r\ndifferently marked in the French, Spanish, and English charts. The\r\nlongitudes deduced from the accurate observations of Messrs.\r\nChurruca, Fidalgo, and Noguera, were not then published.\r\n\r\nThe pilots trusted more to the log than the timekeeper; they smiled\r\nat the prediction of so speedily making land, and thought\r\nthemselves two or three days' sail from the coast. It was therefore\r\nwith great pleasure, that on the 13th, about six in the morning, I\r\nlearned that very high land was seen from the mast-head, though not\r\nclearly, as it was surrounded with a thick fog. The wind blew hard,\r\nand the sea was very rough. Large drops of rain fell at intervals,\r\nand every indication menaced tempestuous weather. The captain of\r\nthe Pizarro intended to pass through the channel which separates\r\nthe islands of Tobago and Trinidad; and knowing that our sloop was\r\nvery slow in tacking, he was afraid of falling to leeward towards\r\nthe south, and approaching the Boca del Drago. We were in fact\r\nsurer of our longitude than of our latitude, having had no\r\nobservation at noon since the 11th. Double altitudes which I took\r\nin the morning, after Douwes's method, placed us in 11 degrees 6\r\nminutes 50 seconds, consequently 15 minutes north of our reckoning.\r\nThough the result clearly proved that the high land on the horizon\r\nwas not Trinidad, but Tobago, yet the captain continued to steer\r\nnorth-north-west, in search of this latter island.\r\n\r\nAn observation of the meridian altitude of the sun fully confirmed\r\nthe latitude obtained by Douwes's method. No more doubt remained as\r\nto the position of the vessel, with respect to the island, and we\r\nresolved to double Cape North (Tobago) to pass between that island\r\nand Grenada, and steer towards a port in Margareta.\r\n\r\nThe island of Tobago presents a very picturesque aspect. It is\r\nmerely a heap of rocks carefully cultivated. The dazzling whiteness\r\nof the stone forms an agreeable contrast to the verdure of some\r\nscattered tufts of trees. Cylindric and very lofty cactuses crown\r\nthe top of the mountains, and give a peculiar physiognomy to this\r\ntropical landscape. The sight of the trees alone is sufficient to\r\nremind the navigator that he has reached an American coast; for\r\nthese cactuses are as exclusively peculiar to the New World, as the\r\nheaths are to the Old.\r\n\r\nWe crossed the shoal which joins Tobago to the island of Grenada.\r\nThe colour of the sea presented no visible change; but the\r\ncentigrade thermometer, plunged into the water to the depth of some\r\ninches, rose only to 23 degrees; while farther at sea eastward on\r\nthe same parallel, and equally near the surface, it kept at 25.6\r\ndegrees. Notwithstanding the currents, the cooling of the water\r\nindicated the existence of the shoal, which is noted in only a very\r\nfew charts. The wind slackened after sunset, and the clouds\r\ndisappeared as the moon reached the zenith. The number of falling\r\nstars was very considerable on this and the following nights; they\r\nappeared less frequent towards the north than the south over Terra\r\nFirma, which we began to coast. This position seems to prove the\r\ninfluence of local causes on meteors, the nature of which is not\r\nyet sufficiently known to us.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th at sunrise, we were in sight of the Boca del Drago. We\r\ndistinguished Chacachacarreo, the most westerly of the islands\r\nsituated between Cape Paria and the north-west cape of Trinidad.\r\nWhen we were five leagues distant from the coast, we felt, near\r\nPunta de la Boca, the effect of a particular current which carried\r\nthe ship southward. The motion of the waters which flow through the\r\nBoca del Draco, and the action of the tides, occasion an eddy. We\r\ncast the lead, and found from thirty-six to forty-three fathoms on\r\na bottom of very fine green clay. According to the rules\r\nestablished by Dampier, we ought not to have expected so little\r\ndepth near a coast formed by very high and perpendicular mountains.\r\nWe continued to heave the lead till we reached Cabo de tres\r\nPuntas* (* Cape Three Points, the name given to it by Columbus.) and\r\nwe every where found shallow water, apparently indicating the\r\nprolongation of the ancient coast. In these latitudes the\r\ntemperature of the sea was from twenty-three to twenty-four\r\ndegrees, consequently from 1.5 to two degrees lower than in the\r\nopen ocean, beyond the edge of the bank.\r\n\r\nThe Cabo de tres Puntas is, according to my observations, in 65\r\ndegrees 4 minutes 5 seconds longitude. It seemed to us the more\r\nelevated, as the clouds concealed the view of its indented top.\r\nThe aspect of the mountains of Paria, their colour, and especially\r\ntheir generally rounded forms, made us suspect that the coast was\r\ngranitic; but we afterwards recognized how delusive, even to those\r\nwho have passed their lives in scaling mountains, are impressions\r\nrespecting the nature of rocks seen at a distance.\r\n\r\nA dead calm, which lasted several hours, permitted us to determine\r\nwith exactness the intensity of the magnetic forces opposite the\r\nCabo de tres Puntas. This intensity was greater than in the open\r\nsea, to the east of the island of Tobago, in the ratio of from 237\r\nto 229. During the calm the current drew us on rapidly to the west.\r\nIts velocity was three miles an hour, and it increased as we\r\napproached the meridian of Testigos, a heap of rocks which rises up\r\namidst the waters. At the setting of the moon, the sky was covered\r\nwith clouds, the wind freshened anew, and the rain descended in one\r\nof those torrents peculiar to the torrid zone.\r\n\r\nThe malady which had broken out on board the Pizarro had made rapid\r\nprogress, from the time when we approached the coasts of Terra\r\nFirma; but having then almost reached the end of our voyage we\r\nflattered ourselves that all who were sick would be restored to\r\nhealth, as soon as we could land them at the island of St.\r\nMargareta, or the port of Cumana, places remarkable for their great\r\nsalubrity.\r\n\r\nThis hope was unfortunately not realised. The youngest of the\r\npassengers attacked with the malignant fever fell a victim to the\r\ndisease. He was an Asturian, nineteen years of age, the only son of\r\na poor widow. Several circumstances rendered the death of this\r\nyoung man affecting. His countenance bore the expression of\r\nsensibility and great mildness of disposition. He had embarked\r\nagainst his own inclination; and his mother, whom he had hoped to\r\nassist by the produce of his efforts, had made a sacrifice of her\r\naffection in the hope of securing the fortune of her son, by\r\nsending him to the colonies to a rich relation, who resided at the\r\nisland of Cuba. The unfortunate young man expired on the third day\r\nof his illness, having fallen from the beginning into a lethargic\r\nstate interrupted only by fits of delirium. The yellow fever, or\r\nblack vomit, at Vera Cruz, scarcely carries off the sick with so\r\nalarming a rapidity. Another Asturian, still younger, did not leave\r\nfor one moment the bed of his dying friend; and, what is very\r\nremarkable, did not contract the disorder.\r\n\r\nWe were assembled on the deck, absorbed in melancholy reflections.\r\nIt was no longer doubtful, that the fever which raged on board had\r\nassumed within the last few days a fatal aspect. Our eyes were\r\nfixed on a hilly and desert coast on which the moon, from time to\r\ntime, shed her light athwart the clouds. The sea, gently agitated,\r\nemitted a feeble phosphoric light. Nothing was heard but the\r\nmonotonous cry of a few large sea-birds, flying towards the shore.\r\nA profound calm reigned over these solitary regions, but this calm\r\nof nature was in discordance with the painful feelings by which we\r\nwere oppressed. About eight o'clock the dead man's knell was slowly\r\ntolled. At this lugubrious sound, the sailors suspended their\r\nlabours, and threw themselves on their knees to offer a momentary\r\nprayer: an affecting ceremony, which brought to our remembrance\r\nthose times when the primitive christians all considered themselves\r\nas members of the same family. All were united in one common sorrow\r\nfor a misfortune which was felt to be common to all. The corpse of\r\nthe young Asturian was brought upon deck during the night, but the\r\npriest entreated that it might not be committed to the waves till\r\nafter sunrise, that the last rites might be performed, according to\r\nthe usage of the Romish church. There was not an individual on\r\nboard, who did not deplore the death of this young man, whom we had\r\nbeheld, but a few days before, full of cheerfulness and health.\r\n\r\nThose among the passengers who had not yet felt symptoms of the\r\ndisease, resolved to leave the vessel at the first place where she\r\nmight touch, and await the arrival of another packet, to pursue\r\ntheir course to the island of Cuba and to Mexico. They considered\r\nthe between-decks of the ship as infected; and though it was by no\r\nmeans clear to me that the fever was contagious, I thought it most\r\nprudent to land at Cumana. I wished not to visit New Spain, till I\r\nhad made some sojourn on the coasts of Venezuela and Paria; a few\r\nof the productions of which had been examined by the unfortunate\r\nLoefling. We were anxious to behold in their native site, the\r\nbeautiful plants which Bose and Bredemeyer had collected during\r\ntheir journey to the continent, and which adorn the conservatories\r\nof Schoenbrunn and Vienna. It would have been painful to have\r\ntouched at Cumana, or at Guayra, without visiting the interior of a\r\ncountry so little frequented by naturalists.\r\n\r\nThe resolution we formed during the night of the 14th of July, had\r\na happy influence on the direction of our travels; for instead of a\r\nfew weeks, we remained a whole year in this part of the continent.\r\nHad not the fever broken out on board the Pizarro, we should never\r\nhave reached the Orinoco, the Cassiquiare, or even the limits of\r\nthe Portuguese possessions on the Rio Negro. To this direction\r\ngiven to our travels we were perhaps also indebted for the good\r\nhealth we enjoyed during so long an abode in the equinoctial\r\nregions.\r\n\r\nIt is well known, that Europeans, during the first months after\r\ntheir arrival under the scorching sky of the tropics, are exposed\r\nto the greatest dangers. They consider themselves to be safe, when\r\nthey have passed the rainy season in the West India islands, at\r\nVera Cruz, or at Carthagena. This opinion is very general, although\r\nthere are examples of persons, who, having escaped a first attack\r\nof the yellow fever, have fallen victims to the same disease in one\r\nof the following years. The facility of becoming acclimated, seems\r\nto be in the inverse ratio of the difference that exists between\r\nthe mean temperature of the torrid zone, and that of the native\r\ncountry of the traveller, or colonist, who changes his climate;\r\nbecause the irritability of the organs, and their vital action, are\r\npowerfully modified by the influence of the atmospheric heat. A\r\nPrussian, a Pole, or a Swede, is more exposed on his arrival at the\r\nislands or on the continent, than a Spaniard, an Italian, or even\r\nan inhabitant of the South of France. With respect to the people of\r\nthe north, the difference of the mean temperature is from nineteen\r\nto twenty-one degrees, while to the people of southern countries it\r\nis only from nine to ten. We were fortunate enough to pass safely\r\nthrough the interval during which a European recently landed runs\r\nthe greatest danger, in the extremely hot, but very dry climate of\r\nCumana, a city celebrated for its salubrity.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 15th, when nearly on a line with the hill of\r\nSt. Joseph, we were surrounded by a great quantity of floating\r\nseaweed. Its stems had those extraordinary appendages in the form\r\nof little cups and feathers, which Don Hippolyto Ruiz remarked on\r\nhis return from the expedition to Chile, and which he described in\r\na separate memoir as the generative organs of the Fucus natans. A\r\nfortunate accident allowed us the means of verifying a fact which\r\nhad been but once observed by naturalists. The bundles of fucus\r\ncollected by M. Bonpland were completely identical with the\r\nspecimens given us by the learned authors of the Flora of Peru. On\r\nexamining both with the microscope, we found that the supposed\r\nparts of fructification, the stamina and pistils, belong to a new\r\ngenus, of the family of the Ceratophytae.\r\n\r\nThe coast of Paria stretches to the west, forming a wall of rocks\r\nof no great height, with rounded tops and a waving outline. We were\r\nlong without perceiving the bold coasts of the island of Margareta,\r\nwhere we were to stop for the purpose of ascertaining whether we\r\ncould touch at Guayra. We had learned, by altitudes of the sun,\r\ntaken under very favourable circumstances, how incorrect at that\r\nperiod were the most highly-esteemed marine charts. On the morning\r\nof the 15th, when the time-keeper placed us in 66 degrees 1 minute\r\n15 seconds longitude, we were not yet in the meridian of Margareta\r\nisland; though according to the reduced chart of the Atlantic ocean,\r\nwe ought to have passed the very lofty western cape of this island,\r\nwhich is laid down in longitude 66 degrees 0 minutes. The\r\ninaccuracy with which the coasts were delineated previously to the\r\nlabours of Fidalgo, Noguera, and Tiscar, and I may venture to add,\r\nbefore the astronomical observations I made at Cumana, might have\r\nbecome dangerous to navigators, were not the sea uniformly calm in\r\nthose regions. The errors in latitude were still greater than those\r\nin longitude, for the coasts of New Andalusia stretch to the\r\nwestward of Cape Three Points (or tres Puntas) fifteen or twenty\r\nmiles more to the north, than appears in the charts published\r\nbefore the year 1800.\r\n\r\nAbout eleven in the morning we perceived a very low islet, covered\r\nwith a few sandy downs, and on which we discovered with our glasses\r\nno trace of habitation or culture. Cylindrical cactuses rose here\r\nand there in the form of candelabra. The soil, almost destitute of\r\nvegetation, seemed to have a waving motion, in consequence of the\r\nextraordinary refraction which the rays of the sun undergo in\r\ntraversing the strata of air in contact with plains strongly\r\nheated. Under every zone, deserts and sandy shores appear like an\r\nagitated sea, from the effect of mirage.\r\n\r\nThe coasts, seen at a distance, are like clouds, in which each\r\nobserver meets the form of the objects that occupy his imagination.\r\nOur bearings and our chronometer being at variance with the charts\r\nwhich we had to consult, we were lost in vain conjectures. Some\r\ntook mounds of sand for Indian huts, and pointed out the place\r\nwhere they alleged the fort of Pampatar was situated; others saw\r\nherds of goats, which are so common in the dry valley of St. John;\r\nor descried the lofty mountains of Macanao, which seemed to them\r\npartly hidden by the clouds. The captain resolved to send a pilot\r\non shore, and the men were preparing to get out the long-boat when\r\nwe perceived two canoes sailing along the coast. We fired a gun as\r\na signal for them, and though we had hoisted Spanish colours, they\r\ndrew near with distrust. These canoes, like all those in use among\r\nthe natives, were constructed of the single trunk of a tree. In\r\neach canoe there were eighteen Guayqueria Indians, naked to the\r\nwaist, and of very tall stature. They had the appearance of great\r\nmuscular strength, and the colour of their skin was something\r\nbetween brown and copper-colour. Seen at a distance, standing\r\nmotionless, and projected on the horizon, they might have been\r\ntaken for statues of bronze. We were the more struck with their\r\nappearance, as it did not correspond with the accounts given by\r\nsome travellers respecting the characteristic features and extreme\r\nfeebleness of the natives. We afterwards learned, without passing\r\nthe limits of the province of Cumana, the great contrast existing\r\nbetween the physiognomy of the Guayquerias and that of the Chaymas\r\nand the Caribs.\r\n\r\nWhen we were near enough to hail them in Spanish, the Indians threw\r\naside their mistrust, and came straight on board. They informed us\r\nthat the low islet near which we were at anchor was Coche, which\r\nhad never been inhabited; and that Spanish vessels coming from\r\nEurope were accustomed to sail farther north, between this island\r\nand that of Margareta, to take a coasting pilot at the port of\r\nPampatar. Our inexperience had led us into the channel to the south\r\nof Coche; and as at that period the English cruisers frequented\r\nthis passage, the Indians had at first taken us for an enemy's\r\nship. The southern passage is, in fact, highly advantageous for\r\nvessels going to Cumana and Barcelona. The water is less deep than\r\nin the northern passage, which is much narrower; but there is no\r\nrisk of touching the ground, if vessels keep very close to the\r\nisland of Lobos and the Moros del Tunal. The channel between Coche\r\nand Margareta is narrowed by the shoals off the north-west cape of\r\nCoche, and by the bank that surrounds La Punta de los Mangles.\r\n\r\nThe Guayquerias belong to that tribe of civilized Indians who\r\ninhabit the coasts of Margareta and the suburbs of the city of\r\nCumana. Next to the Caribs of Spanish Guiana they are the finest\r\nrace of men in Terra Firma. They enjoy several privileges, because\r\nfrom the earliest times of the conquest they remained faithful\r\nfriends to the Castilians. The king of Spain styles them in his\r\npublic acts, \"his dear, noble, and loyal Guayquerias.\" The Indians\r\nof the two canoes we had met had left the port of Cumana during the\r\nnight. They were going in search of timber to the forests of cedar\r\n(Cedrela odorata, Linn.), which extend from Cape San Jose to beyond\r\nthe mouth of Rio Carupano. They gave us some fresh cocoa-nuts, and\r\nvery beautifully coloured fish of the Chaetodon genus. What riches\r\nto our eyes were contained in the canoes of these poor Indians!\r\nBroad spreading leaves of Vijao* (* Heliconia bihai.) covered\r\nbunches of plantains. The scaly cuirass of an armadillo (Dasypus),\r\nthe fruit of the Calabash tree (Crescentia cujete), used as a cup\r\nby the natives, productions common in the cabinets of Europe, had a\r\npeculiar charm for us, because they reminded us that, having\r\nreached the torrid zone, we had attained the end to which our\r\nwishes had been so long directed.\r\n\r\nThe master of one of the canoes offered to remain on board the\r\nPizarro as coasting pilot (practico). He was a Guayqueria of an\r\nexcellent disposition, sagacious in his observations, and he had\r\nbeen led by intelligent curiosity to notice the productions of the\r\nsea as well as the plants of the country. By a fortunate chance,\r\nthe first Indian we met on our arrival was the man whose\r\nacquaintance became the most useful to us in the course of our\r\nresearches. I feel a pleasure in recording in this itinerary the\r\nname of Carlos del Pino, who, during the space of sixteen months,\r\nattended us in our course along the coasts, and into the inland\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe captain of the corvette weighed anchor towards evening. Before\r\nwe left the shoal or placer of Coche, I ascertained the longitude\r\nof the east cape of the island, which I found to be 66 degrees 11\r\nminutes 53 seconds. As we steered westward, we soon came in sight\r\nof the little island of Cubagua, now entirely deserted, but formerly\r\ncelebrated for its fishery of pearls. There the Spaniards,\r\nimmediately after the voyages of Columbus and Ojeda, founded, under\r\nthe name of New Cadiz, a town, of which there now remains no\r\nvestige. At the beginning of the sixteenth century the pearls of\r\nCubagua were known at Seville, at Toledo, and at the great fairs of\r\nAugsburg and Bruges. New Cadiz having no water, that of the Rio\r\nManzanares was conveyed thither from the neighbouring coast, though\r\nfor some reason, I know not what, it was thought to be the cause of\r\ndiseases of the eyes. The writers of that period all speak of the\r\nriches of the first planters, and the luxury they displayed. At\r\npresent, downs of shifting sand cover this uninhabited land, and\r\nthe name of Cubagua is scarcely found in our charts.\r\n\r\nHaving reached these latitudes, we saw the high mountains of Cape\r\nMacanao, on the western side of the island of Margareta, which rose\r\nmajestically on the horizon. If we might judge from the angles of\r\naltitude of the tops, taken at eighteen miles' distance, they\r\nappeared to be about 500 or 600 toises high. According to\r\nBerthoud's time-keeper, the longitude of Cape Macanao is 66 degrees\r\n47 minutes 5 seconds. I speak of the rocks at the extremity of the\r\ncape, and not that strip of very low land which stretches to the\r\nwest, and loses itself in a shoal. The position of Macanao and that\r\nwhich I have assigned to the east point of the island of Coche,\r\ndiffer only four seconds in time, from the results obtained by\r\nM. Fidalgo.\r\n\r\nThere being little wind, the captain preferred standing off and on\r\ntill daybreak. We passed a part of the night on deck. The\r\nGuayqueria pilot conversed with us respecting the animals and\r\nplants of his country. We learned with great satisfaction that\r\nthere was, a few leagues from the coast, a mountainous region\r\ninhabited by the Spaniards, in which the cold was sensibly felt;\r\nand that in the plains there were two species of crocodiles, very\r\ndifferent from each other, besides, boas, electric eels, and\r\nseveral kinds of tigers. Though the words bava, cachicamo, and\r\ntemblador, were entirely unknown to us, we easily guessed, from the\r\npilot's simple description of their manners and forms, the species\r\nwhich the creoles distinguished by these denominations.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.4.\r\n\r\nFIRST ABODE AT CUMANA.\r\nBANKS OF THE MANZANARES.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of July, 1799, at break of day, we beheld a verdant\r\ncoast, of picturesque aspect. The mountains of New Andalusia,\r\nhalf-veiled by mists, bounded the horizon to the south. The city of\r\nCumana and its castle appeared between groups of cocoa-trees. We\r\nanchored in the port about nine in the morning, forty-one days\r\nafter our departure from Corunna; the sick dragged themselves on\r\ndeck to enjoy the sight of a land which was to put an end to their\r\nsufferings. Our eyes were fixed on the groups of cocoa-trees which\r\nborder the river: their trunks, more than sixty feet high, towered\r\nover every object in the landscape. The plain was covered with the\r\ntufts of Cassia, Caper, and those arborescent mimosas, which, like\r\nthe pine of Italy, spread their branches in the form of an\r\numbrella. The pinnated leaves of the palms were conspicuous on the\r\nazure sky, the clearness of which was unsullied by any trace of\r\nvapour. The sun was ascending rapidly toward the zenith. A dazzling\r\nlight was spread through the air, along the whitish hills strewed\r\nwith cylindric cactuses, and over a sea ever calm, the shores of\r\nwhich were peopled with alcatras,* (* A brown pelican, of the size\r\nof a swan. (Pelicanus fuscus, Linn.)) egrets, and flamingoes. The\r\nsplendour of the day, the vivid colouring of the vegetable world,\r\nthe forms of the plants, the varied plumage of the birds,\r\neverything was stamped with the grand character of nature in the\r\nequinoctial regions.\r\n\r\nThe city of Cumana, the capital of New Andalusia, is a mile distant\r\nfrom the embarcadero, or the battery of the Boca, where we landed,\r\nafter having passed the bar of the Manzanares. We had to cross a\r\nvast plain, called el Salado, which divides the suburb of the\r\nGuayquerias from the sea-coast. The excessive heat of the\r\natmosphere was augmented by the reverberation of the soil, partly\r\ndestitute of vegetation. The centigrade thermometer, plunged into\r\nthe white sand, rose to 37.7 degrees. In the small pools of salt\r\nwater it kept at 30.5 degrees, while the heat of the ocean, at its\r\nsurface, is generally, in the port of Cumana, from 25.2 to 26.3\r\ndegrees. The first plant we gathered on the continent of America\r\nwas the Avicennia tomentosa,8 (* Mangle prieto.) which in this\r\nplace scarcely reaches two feet in height. This shrub, together\r\nwith the sesuvium, the yellow gomphrena, and the cactus, cover soil\r\nimpregnated with muriate of soda; they belong to that small number\r\nof plants which live in society like the heath of Europe, and which\r\nin the torrid zone are found only on the seashore, and on the\r\nelevated plains of the Andes.* (* On the extreme rarity of the\r\nsocial plants in the tropics, see my Essay on the Geog. of Plants\r\npage 19; and a paper by Mr. Brown on the Proteacea, Transactions of\r\nthe Lin. Soc. volume 10 page 1, page 23, in which that great\r\nbotanist has extended and confirmed by numerous facts my ideas on\r\nthe association of plants of the same species.) The Avicennia of\r\nCumana is distinguished by another peculiarity not less remarkable:\r\nit furnishes an instance of a plant common to the shores of South\r\nAmerica and the coasts of Malabar.\r\n\r\nThe Indian pilot led us across his garden, which rather resembled a\r\ncopse than a piece of cultivated ground. He showed us, as a proof\r\nof the fertility of this climate, a silk-cotton tree (Bombax\r\nheptaphyllum), the trunk of which, in its fourth year, had reached\r\nnearly two feet and a half in diameter. We have observed, on the\r\nbanks of the Orinoco and the river Magdalena, that the bombax, the\r\ncarolinea, the ochroma, and other trees of the family of the\r\nmalvaceae, are of extremely rapid growth. I nevertheless think that\r\nthere was some exaggeration in the report of the Indian respecting\r\nthe age of his bombax; for under the temperate zone, in the hot and\r\ndamp lands of North America, between the Mississippi and the\r\nAlleghany mountains, the trees do not exceed a foot in diameter, in\r\nten years. Vegetation in those parts is in general but a fifth more\r\nspeedy than in Europe, even taking as an example the Platanus\r\noccidentalis, the tulip tree, and the Cupressus disticha, which\r\nreach from nine to fifteen feet in diameter. On the strand of\r\nCumana, in the garden of the Guayqueria pilot, we saw for the first\r\ntime a guama* loaded with flowers, and remarkable for the extreme\r\nlength and silvery splendour of its numerous stamina. (* Inga\r\nspuria, which we must not confound with the common inga, Inga vera,\r\nWilld. (Mimosa Inga, Linn.). The white stamina, which, to the\r\nnumber of sixty or seventy, are attached to a greenish corolla,\r\nhave a silky lustre, and are terminated by a yellow anther. The\r\nflower of the guama is eighteen lines long. The common height of\r\nthis fine tree, which prefers a moist soil, is from eight to ten\r\ntoises.) We crossed the suburb of the Guayqueria Indians, the\r\nstreets of which are very regular, and formed of small houses,\r\nquite new, and of a pleasing appearance. This part of the town had\r\njust been rebuilt, for the earthquake had laid Cumana in ruins\r\neighteen months before our arrival. By a wooden bridge, we crossed\r\nthe river Manzanares, which contains a few bavas, or crocodiles of\r\nthe smaller species.\r\n\r\nWe were conducted by the captain of the Pizarro to the governor of\r\nthe province, Don Vincente Emparan, to present to him the passports\r\nfurnished to us by the first Secretary of State at Madrid. He\r\nreceived us with that frankness and unaffected dignity which have\r\nat all times characterized the natives of Biscay. Before he was\r\nappointed governor of Portobello and Cumana, Don Vincente Emparan\r\nhad distinguished himself as captain of a vessel in the navy. His\r\nname recalls to mind one of the most extraordinary and distressing\r\nevents recorded in the history of maritime warfare. At the time of\r\nthe last rupture between Spain and England, two brothers of Senor\r\nEmperan, both of whom commanded ships in the Spanish navy, engaged\r\nwith each other before the port of Cadiz, each supposing that he\r\nwas attacking an enemy. A fierce battle was kept up during a whole\r\nnight, and both the vessels were sunk almost simultaneously. A very\r\nsmall part of the crew was saved, and the two brothers had the\r\nmisfortune to recognize each other a little before they expired.\r\n\r\nThe governor of Cumana expressed his great satisfaction at the\r\nresolution we had taken to remain for some time in New Andalusia, a\r\nprovince which at that period was but little known even by name in\r\nEurope, and which in its mountains, and on the banks of its\r\nnumerous rivers, contains a great number of objects worthy of\r\nfixing the attention of naturalists. Senor Emperan showed us\r\ncottons dyed with native plants, and fine furniture made\r\nexclusively of the wood of the country. He was much interested in\r\neverything that related to natural philosophy; and asked, to our\r\ngreat astonishment, whether we thought, that, under the beautiful\r\nsky of the tropics, the atmosphere contained less azote (azotico)\r\nthan in Spain; or whether the rapidity with which iron oxidates in\r\nthose climates, were only the effect of greater humidity as\r\nindicated by the air hygrometer. The name of his native country\r\npronounced on a distant shore would not have been more agreeable to\r\nthe ear of a traveller, than those words azote, oxide of iron, and\r\nhygrometer, were to ours. Senor Emparan was a lover of science, and\r\nthe public marks of consideration which he gave us during a long\r\nabode in his government, contributed greatly to procure us a\r\nfavourable welcome in every part of South America.\r\n\r\nWe hired a spacious house, the situation of which was favourable\r\nfor astronomical observations. We enjoyed an agreeable coolness\r\nwhen the breeze arose; the windows were without glass, and even\r\nwithout those paper panes which are often substituted for glass at\r\nCumana. The whole of the passengers of the Pizarro left the vessel,\r\nbut the recovery of those who had been attacked by the fever was\r\nvery slow. We saw some who, a month after, notwithstanding the care\r\nbestowed on them by their countrymen, were still extremely weak and\r\nreduced. Hospitality, in the Spanish colonies, is such, that a\r\nEuropean who arrives, without recommendation or pecuniary means, is\r\nalmost sure of finding assistance, if he land in any port on\r\naccount of sickness. The Catalonians, the Galicians, and the\r\nBiscayans, have the most frequent intercourse with America. They\r\nthere form as it were three distinct corporations, which exercise a\r\nremarkable influence over the morals, the industry, and commerce of\r\nthe colonies. The poorest inhabitant of Siges or Vigo is sure of\r\nbeing received into the house of a Catalonian or Galician pulpero,*\r\n(* A retail dealer.) whether he land in Chile or the Philippine\r\nIslands.\r\n\r\nAmong the sick who landed at Cumana was a negro, who fell into a\r\nstate of insanity a few days after our arrival; he died in that\r\ndeplorable condition, though his master, almost seventy years old,\r\nwho had left Europe to settle at San Blas, at the entrance of the\r\ngulf of California, had attended him with the greatest care. I\r\nrelate this fact as affording evidence that men born under the\r\ntorrid zone, after having dwelt in temperate climates, sometimes\r\nfeel the pernicious effects of the heat of the tropics. The negro\r\nwas a young man, eighteen years of age, very robust, and born on\r\nthe coast of Guinea; an abode of some years on the high plain of\r\nCastile, had imparted to his organization that kind of irritability\r\nwhich renders the miasma of the torrid zone so dangerous to the\r\ninhabitants of the countries of the north.\r\n\r\nThe site on which Cumana is built is part of a tract of ground,\r\nvery remarkable in a geological point of view. The chain of the\r\ncalcareous Alps of the Brigantine and the Tataraqual stretches east\r\nand west from the summit of the Imposible to the port of Mochima\r\nand to Campanario. The sea, in times far remote, appears to have\r\ndivided this chain from the rocky coasts of Araya and Maniquarez.\r\nThe vast gulf of Cariaco has been caused by an irruption of the\r\nsea; and no doubt can be entertained but that the waters once\r\ncovered, on the southern bank, the whole tract of land impregnated\r\nwith muriate of soda, through which flows the Manzanares. The slow\r\nretreat of the waters has turned into dry ground this extensive\r\nplain, in which rises a group of small hills, composed of gypsum\r\nand calcareous breccias of very recent formation. The city of\r\nCumana is backed by this group, which was formerly an island of the\r\ngulf of Cariaco. That part of the plain which is north of the city,\r\nis called Plaga Chica, or the Little Plain, and extends eastwards\r\nas far as Punta Delgada, where a narrow valley, covered with yellow\r\ngomphrena, still marks the point of the ancient outlet of the\r\nwaters.\r\n\r\nThe hill of calcareous breccias, which we have just mentioned as\r\nhaving once been an island in the ancient gulf, is covered with a\r\nthick forest of cylindric cactus and opuntia. Some of these trees,\r\nthirty or forty feet high, are covered with lichens, and are\r\ndivided into several branches in the form of candelabra. Near\r\nManiquarez, at Punta Araya, we measured a cactus,* the trunk of\r\nwhich was four feet nine inches in circumference (* Tuna macho. We\r\ndistinguish in the wood of the cactus the medullary prolongations,\r\nas M. Desfontaines has already observed.). A European acquainted\r\nonly with the opuntia in our hot-houses is surprised to see the\r\nwood of this plant become so hard from age, that it resists for\r\ncenturies both air and moisture: the Indians of Cumana therefore\r\nemploy it in preference to any other for oars and door-posts.\r\nCumana, Coro, the island of Margareta, and Curassao, are the parts\r\nof South America that abound most in plants of the nopal family.\r\nThere only, a botanist, after a long residence, could compose a\r\nmonography of the genus cactus, the species of which vary not only\r\nin their flowers and fruits, but also in the form of their\r\narticulated stems, the number of costae, and the disposition of the\r\nthorns. We shall see hereafter how these plants, which characterize\r\na warm and singularly dry climate, like that of Egypt and\r\nCalifornia, gradually disappear in proportion as we remove from the\r\ncoasts, and penetrate into the inland country.\r\n\r\nThe groups of columnar cactus and opuntia produce the same effect\r\nin the arid lands of equinoctial America as the junceae and the\r\nhydrocharides in the marshes of our northern climes. Places in\r\nwhich the larger species of the strong cactus are collected in\r\ngroups are considered as almost impenetrable. These places are\r\ncalled Tunales; and they are impervious not only to the native, who\r\ngoes naked to the waist, but are formidable even to those who are\r\nfully clothed. In our solitary rambles we sometimes endeavoured to\r\npenetrate into the Tunal that crowns the summit of the castle hill,\r\na part of which is crossed by a pathway, where we could have\r\nstudied, amidst thousands of specimens, the organization of this\r\nsingular plant. Sometimes night suddenly overtook us, for there is\r\nscarcely any twilight in this climate; and we then found ourselves\r\ndangerously situated, as the Cascabel, or rattle-snake, the Coral,\r\nand other vipers armed with poisonous fangs, frequent these\r\nscorched and arid haunts, to deposit their eggs in the sand.\r\n\r\nThe castle of San Antonio is built at the western extremity of the\r\nhill, but not on the most elevated point, being commanded on the\r\neast by an unfortified summit. The Tunal is considered both here\r\nand everywhere in the Spanish colonies as a very important means of\r\nmilitary defence; and when earthen works are raised, the engineers\r\nare eager to propagate the thorny opuntia, and promote its growth,\r\nas they are careful to keep crocodiles in the ditches of fortified\r\nplaces. In regions where organized nature is so powerful and\r\nactive, man summons as auxiliaries in his defence the carnivorous\r\nreptile, and the plant with its formidable armour of thorns.\r\n\r\nThe castle is only thirty toises above the level of the water in\r\nthe gulf of Cariaco. Standing on a naked and calcareous hill, it\r\ncommands the town, and has a very picturesque effect when viewed\r\nfrom a vessel entering the port. It forms a bright object against\r\nthe dark curtains of those mountains which raise their summits to\r\nthe clouds, and of which the vaporous and bluish tint blends with\r\nthe azure sky. On descending from Fort San Antonio to the\r\nsouth-west, we find on the slope of the same rock the ruins of the\r\nold castle of Santa Maria. This site is delightful to those who\r\nwish to enjoy at the approach of sunset the freshness of the breeze\r\nand the view of the gulf. The lofty summits of the island of\r\nMargareta are seen above the rocky coast of the isthmus of Araya,\r\nand towards the west the small islands of Caracas, Picuita, and\r\nBoracha, recall to mind the catastrophes that have overwhelmed the\r\ncoasts of Terra Firma. These islets resemble fortifications, and\r\nfrom the effect of the mirage (while the inferior strata of the\r\nair, the ocean, and the soil, are unequally heated by the sun),\r\ntheir points appear raised like the extremity of the great\r\npromontories of the coast. It is pleasing, during the day, to\r\nobserve these inconstant phenomena; we see, as night approaches,\r\nthese stony masses which had been suspended in the air, settle down\r\non their bases; and the luminary, whose presence vivifies organic\r\nnature, seems by the variable inflection of its rays to impress\r\nmotion on the stable rock, and give an undulating movement to\r\nplains covered with arid sands.* (* The real cause of the mirage,\r\nor the extraordinary refraction which the rays undergo when strata\r\nof air of different densities lie over each other, was guessed at\r\nby Hooke.--See his Posthumous Works page 472.)\r\n\r\nThe town of Cumana, properly so called, occupies the ground lying\r\nbetween the castle of San Antonio and the small rivers of\r\nManzanares and Santa Catalina. The Delta, formed by the bifurcation\r\nof the first of these rivers, is a fertile plain covered with\r\nMammees, Sapotas (achras), plantains, and other plants cultivated\r\nin the gardens or charas of the Indians. The town has no remarkable\r\nedifice, and the frequency of earthquakes forbids such\r\nembellishments. It is true, that strong shocks occur less\r\nfrequently in a given time at Cumana than at Quito, where we\r\nnevertheless find sumptuous and very lofty churches. But the\r\nearthquakes of Quito are violent only in appearance, and, from the\r\npeculiar nature of the motion and of the ground, no edifice there\r\nis overthrown. At Cumana, as well as at Lima, and in several cities\r\nsituated far from the mouths of burning volcanoes, it happens that\r\nthe series of slight shocks is interrupted after a long course of\r\nyears by great catastrophes, resembling the effects of the\r\nexplosion of a mine. We shall have occasion to return to this\r\nphenomenon, for the explanation of which so many vain theories have\r\nbeen imagined, and which have been classified according to\r\nperpendicular and horizontal movements, shock, and oscillation.* (*\r\nThis classification dates from the time of Posidonius. It is the\r\nsuccessio and inclinatio of Seneca; but the ancients had already\r\njudiciously remarked, that the nature of these shocks is too\r\nvariable to permit any subjection to these imaginary laws.)\r\n\r\nThe suburbs of Cumana are almost as populous as the ancient town.\r\nThey are three in number:--Serritos, on the road to the Plaga\r\nChicha, where we meet with some fine tamarind trees; St. Francis,\r\ntowards the south-east; and the great suburb of the Guayquerias, or\r\nGuayguerias. The name of this tribe of Indians was quite unknown\r\nbefore the conquest. The natives who bear that name formerly\r\nbelonged to the nation of the Guaraounos, of which we find remains\r\nonly in the swampy lands of the branches of the Orinoco. Old men\r\nhave assured me that the language of their ancestors was a dialect\r\nof the Guaraouno; but that for a century past no native of that\r\ntribe at Cumana, or in the island of Margareta, has spoken any\r\nother language than Castilian.\r\n\r\nThe denomination Guayqueria, like the words Peru and Peruvian, owes\r\nits origin to a mere mistake. The companions of Christopher\r\nColumbus, coasting along the island of Margareta, the northern\r\ncoast of which is still inhabited by the noblest portion of the\r\nGuayqueria nation,* (* The Guayquerias of La Banda del Norte\r\nconsider themselves as the most noble race, because they think they\r\nare less mixed with the Chayma Indian, and other copper-coloured\r\nraces. They are distinguished from the Guayquerias of the continent\r\nby their manner of pronouncing the Spanish language, which they\r\nspeak almost without separating their teeth. They show with pride\r\nto Europeans the Punta de la Galera, or Galley's Point, (so called\r\non account of the vessel of Columbus having anchored there), and\r\nthe port of Manzanillo, where they first swore to the whites in\r\n1498, that friendship which they have never betrayed, and which has\r\nobtained for them, in court phraseology, the title of fieles,\r\nloyal.--See above.) encountered a few natives who were harpooning\r\nfish by throwing a pole tied to a cord, and terminating in an\r\nextremely sharp point. They asked them in the Haiti language their\r\nname; and the Indians, thinking that the question of the strangers\r\nrelated to their harpoons, which were formed of the hard and heavy\r\nwood of the Macana palm, answered guaike, guaike, which signifies\r\npointed pole. A striking difference at present exists between the\r\nGuayquerias, a civilized tribe of skilled fishermen, and those\r\nsavage Guaraounos of the Orinoco, who suspend their habitations on\r\nthe trunks of the Moriche palm. The population of Cumana has been\r\nsingularly exaggerated, but according to the most authentic\r\nregisters it does not exceed 16,000 souls.\r\n\r\nProbably the Indian suburb will by degrees extend as far as the\r\nEmbarcadero; the plain, which is not yet covered with houses or\r\nhuts, being more than 340 toises in length. The heat is somewhat\r\nless oppressive on the side near the seashore, than in the old\r\ntown, where the reverberation of the calcareous soil, and the\r\nproximity of the mountain of San Antonio, raise the temperature to\r\nan excessive degree. In the suburb of the Guayquerias, the sea\r\nbreezes have free access; the soil is clayey, and, for that reason,\r\nit is thought to be less exposed to violent shocks of earthquake,\r\nthan the houses at the foot of the rocks and hills on the right\r\nbank of the Manzanares.\r\n\r\nThe shore near the mouth of the small river Santa Catalina is\r\nbordered with mangrove trees,* but these mangroves are not\r\nsufficiently spread to diminish the salubrity of the air of Cumana.\r\n(* Rhizophora mangle. M. Bonpland found on the Plaga Chica the\r\nAllionia incarnata, in the same place where the unfortunate\r\nLoefling had discovered this new genus of Nyctagineae.) The soil of\r\nthe plain is in part destitute of vegetation, in part covered with\r\ntufts of Sesuvium portulacastrum, Gomphrena flava, G. myrtifolia,\r\nTalinum cuspidatum, T. cumanense, and Portulaca lanuginosa. Among\r\nthese herbaceous plants we find at intervals the Avicennia\r\ntomentosa, the Scoparia dulcis, a frutescent mimosa with very\r\nirritable leaves,* and particularly cassias, the number of which is\r\nso great in South America, that we collected, in our travels, more\r\nthan thirty new species. (* The Spaniards designate by the name of\r\ndormideras (sleeping plants), the small number of mimosas with\r\nirritable leaves. We have increased this number by three species\r\npreviously unknown to botanists, namely, the Mimosa humilis of\r\nCumana, the M. pellita of the savannahs of Calabozo, and the M.\r\ndormiens of the banks of the Apure.)\r\n\r\nOn leaving the Indian suburb, and ascending the river southward, we\r\nfound a grove of cactus, a delightful spot, shaded by tamarinds,\r\nbrazilettos, bombax, and other plants, remarkable for their leaves\r\nand flowers. The soil here is rich in pasturage, and dairy-houses\r\nbuilt with reeds, are separated from each other by clumps of trees.\r\nThe milk remains fresh, when kept, not in the calabashes* of very\r\nthick ligneous fibres (* These calabashes are made from the fruit\r\nof the Crescentia cujete.), but in porous earthen vessels from\r\nManiquarez. A prejudice prevalent in northern countries had long\r\nled me to believe, that cows, under the torrid zone, did not yield\r\nrich milk; but my abode at Cumana, and especially an excursion\r\nthrough the vast plains of Calabozo, covered with grasses, and\r\nherbaceous sensitive plants, convinced me that the ruminating\r\nanimals of Europe become perfectly habituated to the hottest\r\nclimates, provided they find water and good nourishment. Milk is\r\nexcellent in the provinces of New Andalusia, Barcelona, and\r\nVenezuela; and butter is better in the plains of the equinoctial\r\nzone, than on the ridge of the Andes, where the Alpine plants,\r\nenjoying in no season a sufficiently high temperature, are less\r\naromatic than on the Pyrenees, on the mountains of Estremadura, or\r\nof Greece. As the inhabitants of Cumana prefer the coolness of the\r\nsea breeze to the sight of vegetation, their favourite walk is the\r\nopen shore. The Spaniards, who in general have no great\r\npredilection for trees, or for the warbling of birds, have\r\ntransported their tastes and their habits into the colonies. In\r\nTerra Firma, Mexico, and Peru, it is rare to see a native plant a\r\ntree, merely with the view of procuring shade; and if we except the\r\nenvirons of the great capitals, walks bordered with trees are\r\nalmost unknown in those countries. The arid plain of Cumana\r\nexhibits after violent showers an extraordinary phenomenon. The\r\nearth, when drenched with rain, and heated again by the rays of the\r\nsun, emits that musky odour which in the torrid zone, is common to\r\nanimals of very different classes, namely: to the jaguar, the small\r\nspecies of tiger cat, the cabiai or thick-nosed tapir,* (* Cavia\r\ncapybara, Linn.; chiguire.) the galinazo vulture,* (* Vultur aura,\r\nLinn., Zamuro, or Galinazo: the Brazilian vulture of Buffon. I\r\ncannot reconcile myself to the adoption of names, which designate,\r\nas belonging to a single country, animals common to a whole\r\ncontinent.) the crocodile, the viper, and the rattlesnake. The\r\ngaseous emanations, which are the vehicles of this aroma, seem to\r\nbe evolved in proportion only as the mould, containing the spoils\r\nof an innumerable quantity of reptiles, worms, and insects, begins\r\nto be impregnated with water. I have seen Indian children, of the\r\ntribe of the Chaymas, draw out from the earth and eat millipedes or\r\nscolopendras* eighteen inches long, and seven lines broad. (*\r\nScolopendras are very common behind the castle of San Antonio, on\r\nthe summit of the hill.) Whenever the soil is turned up, we are\r\nstruck with the mass of organic substances, which by turns are\r\ndeveloped, transformed, and decomposed. Nature in these climates\r\nappears more active, more fruitful, we may even say more prodigal,\r\nof life.\r\n\r\nOn this shore, and near the dairies just mentioned, we enjoy,\r\nespecially at sunrise, a very beautiful prospect over an elevated\r\ngroup of calcareous mountains. As this group subtends an angle of\r\nthree degrees only at the house where we dwelt, it long served me\r\nto compare the variations of the terrestrial refraction with the\r\nmeteorological phenomena. Storms are formed in the centre of this\r\nCordillera; and we see from afar thick clouds resolve into abundant\r\nrains, while during seven or eight months not a drop of water falls\r\nat Cumana. The Brigantine, which is the highest part of this chain,\r\nraises itself in a very picturesque manner behind Brito and\r\nTataraqual. It takes its name from the form of a very deep valley\r\non the northern declivity, which resembles the interior of a ship.\r\nThe summit of this mountain is almost bare of vegetation, and is\r\nflat like that of Mowna Roa, in the Sandwich Islands. It is a\r\nperpendicular wall, or, to use a more expressive term of the\r\nSpanish navigators, a table (mesa). This peculiar form, and the\r\nsymmetrical arrangement of a few cones which surround the\r\nBrigantine, made me at first think that this group, which is wholly\r\ncalcareous, contained rocks of basaltic or trappean formation.\r\n\r\nThe governor of Cumana sent, in 1797, a band of determined men to\r\nexplore this entirely desert country, and to open a direct road to\r\nNew Barcelona, by the summit of the Mesa. It was reasonably\r\nexpected that this way would be shorter, and less dangerous to the\r\nhealth of travellers, than the route taken by the couriers along\r\nthe coasts; but every attempt to cross the chain of the mountains\r\nof the Brigantine was fruitless. In this part of America, as in\r\nAustralia* to the west of Sydney, it is not so much the height of\r\nthe mountain chains, as the form of the rocks, that presents\r\nobstacles difficult to surmount. (* The Blue Mountains of\r\nAustralia, and those of Carmarthen and Lansdowne, are not visible,\r\nin clear weather, beyond fifty miles.--Peron, Voyage aux Terres\r\nAustrales page 389. Supposing the angle of altitude half a degree,\r\nthe absolute height of these mountains would be about 620 toises.)\r\n\r\nThe longitudinal valley formed by the lofty mountains of the\r\ninterior and the southern declivity of the Cerro de San Antonio, is\r\nintersected by the Rio Manzanares. This plain, the only thoroughly\r\nwooded part in the environs of Cumana, is called the Plain of the\r\nCharas,* on account of the numerous plantations which the\r\ninhabitants have begun, for some years past, along the river. (*\r\nChacra, by corruption chara, signifies a hut or cottage surrounded\r\nby a garden. The word ipure has the same signification.) A narrow\r\npath leads from the hill of San Francisco across the forest to the\r\nhospital of the Capuchins, a very agreeable country-house, which\r\nthe Aragonese monks have built as a retreat for old infirm\r\nmissionaries, who can no longer fulfil the duties of their\r\nministry. As we advance to the west, the trees of the forest become\r\nmore vigorous, and we meet with a few monkeys,* (* The common\r\nmachi, or weeping monkey.) which, however, are very rare in the\r\nenvirons of Cumana. At the foot of the capparis, the bauhinia, and\r\nthe zygophyllum with flowers of a golden yellow, there extends a\r\ncarpet of Bromelia,* (* Chihuchihue, of the family of the ananas.)\r\nakin to the B. karatas, which from the odour and coolness of its\r\nfoliage attracts the rattlesnake.\r\n\r\nThe waters of the Manzanares are very limpid in quality, and this\r\nriver has no resemblance to the Manzanares of Madrid, which appears\r\nthe more magnificent in contrast with the fine bridge by which it\r\nis crossed. It takes its source, like all the rivers of New\r\nAndalusia, in the savannahs (llanos) known by the names of the\r\nplateaux of Jonoro, Amana, and Guanipa,* (* These three eminences\r\nbear the names of mesas, tables. An immense plain has an almost\r\nimperceptible rise from both sides to the middle, without any\r\nappearance of mountains or hills.) and it receives, near the Indian\r\nvillage of San Fernando, the waters of the Rio Juanillo. It has\r\nbeen several times proposed to the government, but without success,\r\nto construct a dyke at the first ipure, in order to form artificial\r\nirrigations in the plain of Charas; for, notwithstanding its\r\napparent sterility, the soil is extremely productive, wherever\r\nhumidity is combined with the heat of the climate. The cultivators\r\nwere gradually to refund the money advanced for the construction of\r\nthe sluices. Meanwhile, pumps worked by mules, and other hydraulic\r\nbut imperfect machines, have been erected, to serve till this\r\nproject is carried into execution.\r\n\r\nThe banks of the Manzanares are very pleasant, and are shaded by\r\nmimosas, erythrinas, ceibas, and other trees of gigantic growth. A\r\nriver, the temperature of which, in the season of the floods,\r\ndescends as low as twenty-two degrees, when the air is at thirty\r\nand thirty-three degrees, is an inestimable benefit in a country\r\nwhere the heat is excessive during the whole year, and where it is\r\nso agreeable to bathe several times in the day. The children pass a\r\nconsiderable part of their lives in the water; all the inhabitants,\r\neven the women of the most opulent families, know how to swim; and\r\nin a country where man is so near the state of nature, one of the\r\nfirst questions asked on meeting in the morning is, whether the\r\nwater is cooler than it was on the preceding evening. One of the\r\nmodes of bathing is curious. We every evening visited a family, in\r\nthe suburb of the Guayquerias. In a fine moonlight night, chairs\r\nwere placed in the water; the men and women were lightly clothed,\r\nas in some baths of the north of Europe; and the family and\r\nstrangers, assembled in the river, passed some hours in smoking\r\ncigars, and in talking, according to the custom of the country, of\r\nthe extreme dryness of the season, of the abundant rains in the\r\nneighbouring districts, and particularly of the extravagancies of\r\nwhich the ladies of Cumana accuse those of Caracas and the\r\nHavannah. The company were under no apprehensions from the bavas,\r\nor small crocodiles, which are now extremely scarce, and which\r\napproach men without attacking them. These animals are three or\r\nfour feet long. We never met with them in the Manzanares, but with\r\na great number of dolphins (toninas), which sometimes ascend the\r\nriver in the night, and frighten the bathers by spouting water.\r\n\r\nThe port of Cumana is a roadstead capable of receiving the fleets\r\nof Europe. The whole of the Gulf of Cariaco, which is about 35\r\nmiles long and 48 broad, affords excellent anchorage. The Pacific\r\nis not more calm on the shores of Peru, than the Caribbean Sea from\r\nPorto-cabello, and especially from Cape Codera to the point of\r\nParia. The hurricanes of the West Indies are never felt in these\r\nregions. The only danger in the port of Cumana is a shoal, called\r\nMorro Roxo. There are from one to three fathoms water on this\r\nshoal, while just beyond its edges there are eighteen, thirty, and\r\neven thirty-eight. The remains of an old battery, situated\r\nnorth-north-east of the castle of San Antonio, and very near it,\r\nserve as a mark to avoid the bank of Morro Roxo.\r\n\r\nThe city lies at the foot of a hill destitute of verdure, and is\r\ncommanded by a castle. No steeple or dome attracts from afar the\r\neye of the traveller, but only a few trunks of tamarind, cocoa, and\r\ndate trees, which rise above the houses, the roofs of which are\r\nflat. The surrounding plains, especially those on the coasts, wear\r\na melancholy, dusty, and arid appearance, while a fresh and\r\nluxuriant vegetation marks from afar the windings of the river,\r\nwhich separates the city from the suburbs; the population of\r\nEuropean and mixed race from the copper-coloured natives. The hill\r\nof fort San Antonio, solitary, white, and bare, reflects a great\r\nmass of light, and of radiant heat: it is composed of breccia, the\r\nstrata of which contain numerous fossils. In the distance, towards\r\nthe south, stretches a vast and gloomy curtain of mountains. These\r\nare the high calcareous Alps of New Andalusia, surmounted by\r\nsandstone, and other more recent formations. Majestic forests cover\r\nthis Cordillera of the interior, and they are joined by a woody\r\nvale to the open clayey lands and salt marshes of the environs of\r\nCumana. A few birds of considerable size contribute to give a\r\npeculiar character to these countries. On the seashore, and in the\r\ngulf, we find flocks of fishing herons, and alcatras of a very\r\nunwieldy form, which swim, like the swan, raising their wings.\r\nNearer the habitation of man, thousands of galinazo vultures, the\r\njackals of the winged tribe, are ever busy in disinterring the\r\ncarcases of animals.* (* Buffon Hist. Nat. des Oiseaux tome 1 page\r\n114.) A gulf, containing hot and submarine springs, divides the\r\nsecondary from the primary and schistose rocks of the peninsula of\r\nAraya. Each of these coasts is washed by a tranquil sea, of azure\r\ntint, and always gently agitated by a breeze from one quarter. A\r\nbright clear sky, with a few light clouds at sunset, reposes on the\r\nocean, on the treeless peninsula, and on the plains of Cumana,\r\nwhile we see the storms accumulate and descend in fertile showers\r\namong the inland mountains. Thus on these coasts, as well as at the\r\nfoot of the Andes, the earth and the sky present the extremes of\r\nclear weather and fogs, of drought and torrents of rain, of\r\nabsolute nudity and never-ceasing verdure.\r\n\r\nThe analogies which we have just indicated, between the sea-coasts\r\nof New Andalusia and those of Peru, extend also to the recurrence\r\nof earthquakes, and the limits which nature seems to have\r\nprescribed to these phenomena. We have ourselves felt very violent\r\nshocks at Cumana; and we learned on the spot, the most minute\r\ncircumstances that accompanied the great catastrophe of the 14th\r\nDecember, 1797.\r\n\r\nIt is a very generally received opinion on the coasts of Cumana,\r\nand in the island of Margareta, that the gulf of Cariaco owes its\r\nexistence to a rent of the continent attended by an irruption of\r\nthe sea. The remembrance of that great event was preserved among\r\nthe Indians to the end of the fifteenth century; and it is related\r\nthat, at the time of the third voyage of Christopher Columbus, the\r\nnatives mentioned it as of very recent date. In 1530, the\r\ninhabitants were alarmed by new shocks on the coasts of Paria and\r\nCumana. The land was inundated by the sea, and the small fort,\r\nbuilt by James Castellon at New Toledo,* was entirely destroyed. (*\r\nThis was the first name given to the city of Cumana--Girolamo\r\nBenzoni Hist. del Mondo Nuovo pages 3, 31, and 33. James Castellon\r\narrived at St. Domingo in 1521, after the appearance of the\r\ncelebrated Bartholomew de las Casas in these countries. On\r\nattentively reading the narratives of Benzoni and Caulin, we find\r\nthat the fort of Castellon was built near the mouth of the\r\nManzanares (alla ripa del fiume de Cumana); and not, as some modern\r\ntravellers have asserted, on the mountain where now stands the\r\ncastle of San Antonio.) At the same time an enormous opening was\r\nformed in the mountains of Cariaco, on the shores of the gulf\r\nbearing that name, when a great body of salt-water, mixed with\r\nasphaltum, issued from the micaceous schist. Earthquakes were very\r\nfrequent about the end of the sixteenth century; and, according to\r\nthe traditions preserved at Cumana, the sea often inundated the\r\nshores, rising from fifteen to twenty fathoms.\r\n\r\nAs no record exists at Cumana, and its archives, owing to the\r\ncontinual devastations of the termites, or white ants, contain no\r\ndocument that goes back farther than a hundred and fifty years, we\r\nare unacquainted with the precise dates of the ancient earthquakes.\r\nWe only know, that, in times nearer our own, the year 1776 was at\r\nonce the most fatal to the colonists, and the most remarkable for\r\nthe physical history of the country. The city of Cumana was\r\nentirely destroyed, the houses were overturned in the space of a\r\nfew minutes, and the shocks were hourly repeated during fourteen\r\nmonths. In several parts of the province the earth opened, and\r\nthrew out sulphureous waters. These irruptions were very frequent\r\nin a plain extending towards Casanay, two leagues east of the town\r\nof Cariaco, and known by the name of the hollow ground (tierra\r\nhueca), because it appears entirely undermined by thermal springs.\r\nDuring the years 1766 and 1767, the inhabitants of Cumana encamped\r\nin their streets; and they began to rebuild their houses only when\r\nthe earthquakes recurred once a month. What was felt at Quito,\r\nimmediately after the great catastrophe of February 1797, took\r\nplace on these coasts. While the ground was in a state of continual\r\noscillation, the atmosphere seemed to dissolve itself into water.\r\n\r\nTradition states that in the earthquake of 1766, as well as in\r\nanother remarkable one in 1794, the shocks were mere horizontal\r\noscillations; it was only on the disastrous 14th of December, 1797,\r\nthat for the first time at Cumana the motion was felt by an\r\nupheaving of the ground. More than four-fifths of the city were\r\nthen entirely destroyed; and the shock, attended by a very loud\r\nsubterraneous noise, resembled, as at Riobamba, the explosion of a\r\nmine at a great depth. Happily the most violent shock was preceded\r\nby a slight undulating motion, so that most of the inhabitants were\r\nenabled to escape into the streets, and a small number only\r\nperished of those who had assembled in the churches. It is a\r\ngenerally received opinion at Cumana, that the most destructive\r\nearthquakes are announced by very feeble oscillations, and by a\r\nhollow sound, which does not escape the observation of persons\r\nhabituated to this kind of phenomenon. In those fatal moments the\r\ncries of 'misericordia! tembla! tembla!'* are everywhere heard (*\r\n\"Mercy! the earthquake! the earthquake!\"--See Tschudi's Travels in\r\nPeru page 170.); and it rarely happens that a false alarm is given\r\nby a native. Those who are most apprehensive attentively observe\r\nthe motions of dogs, goats, and swine. The last-mentioned animals,\r\nendowed with delicate olfactory nerves, and accustomed to turn up\r\nthe earth, give warning of approaching danger by their restlessness\r\nand their cries. We shall not attempt to decide, whether, being\r\nnearer the surface of the ground, they are the first to hear the\r\nsubterraneous noise; or whether their organs receive the impression\r\nof some gaseous emanation which issues from the earth. We cannot\r\ndeny the possibility of this latter cause. During my abode at Peru,\r\na fact was observed in the inland country, which has an analogy\r\nwith this kind of phenomenon, and which is not unfrequent. At the\r\nend of violent earthquakes, the herbs that cover the savannahs of\r\nTucuman acquired noxious properties; an epidemic disorder broke out\r\namong the cattle, and a great number of them appeared stupified or\r\nsuffocated by the deleterious vapours exhaled from the ground.\r\n\r\nAt Cumana, half an hour before the catastrophe of the 14th of\r\nDecember, 1797, a strong smell of sulphur was perceived near the\r\nhill of the convent of San Francisco; and on the same spot the\r\nsubterraneous noise, which seemed to proceed from south-east to\r\nnorth-west, was loudest. At the same time flames appeared on the\r\nbanks of the Manzanares, near the hospital of the Capuchins, and in\r\nthe gulf of Cariaco, near Mariguitar. This last phenomenon, so\r\nextraordinary in a country not volcanic, is pretty frequent in the\r\nAlpine calcareous mountains near Cumanacoa, in the valley of\r\nBordones, in the island of Margareta, and amidst the Llanos or\r\nsavannahs of New Andalusia. In these savannahs, flakes of fire\r\nrising to a considerable height, are seen for hours together in the\r\ndryest places; and it is asserted, that, on examining the ground no\r\ncrevice is perceptible. This fire, which resembles the springs of\r\nhydrogen, or Salse, of Modena, or what is called the\r\nwill-o'-the-wisp of our marshes, does not burn the grass; because,\r\nno doubt, the column of gas, which develops itself, is mixed with\r\nazote and carbonic acid, and does not burn at its basis. The\r\npeople, although less superstitious here than in Spain, call these\r\nreddish flames by the singular name of 'the soul of the tyrant\r\nAguirre;' imagining that the spectre of Lopez Aguirre, harassed by\r\nremorse, wanders over these countries sullied by his crimes.* (*\r\nWhen at Cumana, or in the island of Margareta, the people pronounce\r\nthe words el tirano (the tyrant), it is always to denote the hated\r\nLopez d'Aguirre, who, after having taken part, in 1560, in the\r\nrevolt of Fernando de Guzman against Pedro de Ursua, governor of\r\nthe Omeguas and Dorado, voluntarily took the title of traidor, or\r\ntraitor. He descended the river Amazon with his band, and reached\r\nby a communication of the rivers of Guyana the island of Margareta.\r\nThe port of Paraguache still bears, in this island, the name of the\r\nTyrant's Port.)\r\n\r\nThe great earthquake of 1797 produced some changes in the\r\nconfiguration of the shoal of Morro Roxo, towards the mouth of the\r\nRio Bordones. Similar swellings were observed at the time of the\r\ntotal destruction of Cumana, in 1766. At that period, the Punta\r\nDelgado, on the southern coast of the gulf of Cariaco, became\r\nperceptibly enlarged; and in the Rio Guarapiche, near the village\r\nof Maturin, a shoal was formed, no doubt by the action of the\r\nelastic fluids, which displaced and raised up the bed of the river.\r\n\r\nIn order to follow a plan conformable to the end we proposed in\r\nthis work, we shall endeavour to generalize our ideas, and to\r\ncomprehend in one point of view everything that relates to these\r\nphenomena, so terrific, and so difficult to explain. If it be the\r\nduty of the men of science who visit the Alps of Switzerland, or\r\nthe coasts of Lapland, to extend our knowledge respecting the\r\nglaciers and the aurora borealis, it may be expected that a\r\ntraveller who has journeyed through Spanish America, should have\r\nchiefly fixed his attention on volcanoes and earthquakes. Each part\r\nof the globe is an object of particular study; and when we cannot\r\nhope to penetrate the causes of natural phenomena, we ought at\r\nleast to endeavour to discover their laws, and distinguish, by the\r\ncomparison of numerous facts, that which is permanent and uniform\r\nfrom that which is variable and accidental.\r\n\r\nThe great earthquakes, which interrupt the long series of slight\r\nshocks, appear to have no regular periods at Cumana. They have\r\ntaken place at intervals of eighty, a hundred, and sometimes less\r\nthan thirty years; while on the coasts of Peru, for instance at\r\nLima, a certain regularity has marked the periods of the total\r\ndestruction of the city. The belief of the inhabitants in the\r\nexistence of this uniformity has a happy influence on public\r\ntranquillity, and the encouragement of industry. It is generally\r\nadmitted, that it requires a sufficiently long space of time for\r\nthe same causes to act with the same energy; but this reasoning is\r\njust only inasmuch as the shocks are considered as a local\r\nphenomenon; and a particular focus, under each point of the globe\r\nexposed to those great catastrophes, is admitted. Whenever new\r\nedifices are raised on the ruins of the old, we hear from those who\r\nrefuse to build, that the destruction of Lisbon on the first day of\r\nNovember, 1755, was soon followed by a second, and not less fatal\r\nconvulsion, on the 31st of March, 1761.\r\n\r\nIt is a very ancient opinion,* (* Aristotle de Meteor. lib. 2 (ed.\r\nDuval, tome 1 page 798). Seneca Nat. Quaest. lib. 6 c. 12.) and one\r\nthat is commonly received at Cumana, Acapulco, and Lima, that a\r\nperceptible connection exists between earthquakes and the state of\r\nthe atmosphere that precedes those phenomena. But from the great\r\nnumber of earthquakes which I have witnessed to the north and south\r\nof the equator; on the continent, and on the seas; on the coasts,\r\nand at 2500 toises height; it appears to me that the oscillations\r\nare generally very independent of the previous state of the\r\natmosphere. This opinion is entertained by a number of intelligent\r\nresidents of the Spanish colonies, whose experience extends, if not\r\nover a greater space of the globe, at least over a greater number\r\nof years, than mine. On the contrary, in parts of Europe where\r\nearthquakes are rare compared to America, scientific observers are\r\ninclined to admit an intimate connection between the undulations of\r\nthe ground, and certain meteors, which appear simultaneously with\r\nthem. In Italy for instance, the sirocco and earthquakes are\r\nsuspected to have some connection; and in London, the frequency of\r\nfalling-stars, and those southern lights which have since been\r\noften observed by Mr. Dalton, were considered as the forerunners of\r\nthose shocks which were felt from 1748 to 1756.\r\n\r\nOn days when the earth is shaken by violent shocks, the regularity\r\nof the horary variations of the barometer is not disturbed within\r\nthe tropics. I had opportunities of verifying this observation at\r\nCumana, at Lima, and at Riobamba; and it is the more worthy of\r\nattention, as at St. Domingo, (in the town of Cape Francois,) it is\r\nasserted, that a water-barometer sank two inches and a half\r\nimmediately before the earthquake of 1770. It is also related,\r\nthat, at the time of the destruction of Oran, a druggist fled with\r\nhis family, because, observing accidentally, a few minutes before\r\nthe earthquake, the height of the mercury in his barometer, he\r\nperceived that the column sank in an extraordinary manner. I know\r\nnot whether we can give credit to this story; but as it is nearly\r\nimpossible to examine the variations of the weight of the\r\natmosphere during the shocks, we must be satisfied with observing\r\nthe barometer before or after these phenomena have taken place.\r\n\r\nWe can scarcely doubt, that the earth, when opened and agitated by\r\nshocks, spreads occasionally gaseous emanations through the\r\natmosphere, in places remote from the mouths of volcanoes not\r\nextinct. At Cumana, it has already been observed that flames and\r\nvapours mixed with sulphurous acid spring up from the most arid\r\nsoil. In other parts of the same province, the earth ejects water\r\nand petroleum. At Riobamba, a muddy and inflammable mass, called\r\nmoya, issues from crevices that close again, and accumulates into\r\nelevated hills. At about seven leagues from Lisbon, near Colares,\r\nduring the terrible earthquake of the 1st of November, 1755, flames\r\nand a column of thick smoke were seen to issue from the flanks of\r\nthe rocks of Alvidras, and, according to some witnesses, from the\r\nbosom of the sea.\r\n\r\nElastic fluids thrown into the atmosphere may act locally on the\r\nbarometer, not by their mass, which is very small, compared to the\r\nmass of the atmosphere, but because, at the moment of great\r\nexplosions, an ascending current is probably formed, which\r\ndiminishes the pressure of the air. I am inclined to think that in\r\nthe majority of earthquakes nothing escapes from the agitated\r\nearth; and that, when gaseous emanations and vapours are observed,\r\nthey oftener accompany or follow, than precede the shocks. This\r\ncircumstance would seem to explain the mysterious influence of\r\nearthquakes in equinoctial America, on the climate, and on the\r\norder of the dry and rainy seasons. If the earth generally act on\r\nthe air only at the moment of the shocks, we can conceive why a\r\nsensible meteorological change so rarely precedes those great\r\nrevolutions of nature.\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis according to which, in the earthquakes of Cumana,\r\nelastic fluids tend to escape from the surface of the soil, seems\r\nconfirmed by the great noise which is heard during the shocks at\r\nthe borders of the wells in the plain of Charas. Water and sand are\r\nsometimes thrown out twenty feet high. Similar phenomena were\r\nobserved in ancient times by the inhabitants of those parts of\r\nGreece and Asia Minor abounding with caverns, crevices, and\r\nsubterraneous rivers. Nature, in her uniform progress, everywhere\r\nsuggests the same ideas of the causes of earthquakes, and the means\r\nby which man, forgetting the measure of his strength, pretends to\r\ndiminish the effect of the subterraneous explosions. What a great\r\nRoman naturalist has said of the utility of wells and caverns* is\r\nrepeated in the New World by the most ignorant Indians of Quito,\r\nwhen they show travellers the guaicos, or crevices of Pichincha. (*\r\n\"In puteis est remedium, quale et crebri specus praebent: conceptum\r\nenim spiritum exhalant: quod in certis notatur oppidis, quae minus\r\nquatiuntur, crebris ad eluviem cuniculis cavata.\"--Pliny lib. 2 c.\r\n82 (ed. Par. 1723 t. 1 page 112.) Even at present, in the capital\r\nof St. Domingo, wells are considered as diminishing the violence of\r\nthe shocks. I may observe on this occasion, that the theory of\r\nearthquakes, given by Seneca, (Nat. Quaest. lib. 6 c. 4-31),\r\ncontains the germ of everything that has been said in our times on\r\nthe action of the elastic vapours confined in the interior of the\r\nglobe.)\r\n\r\nThe subterranean noise, so frequent during earthquakes, is\r\ngenerally not in the ratio of the force of the shocks. At Cumana it\r\nconstantly precedes them, while at Quito, and recently at Caracas,\r\nand in the West India Islands, a noise like the discharge of a\r\nbattery was heard a long time after the shocks had ceased. A third\r\nkind of phenomenon, the most remarkable of the whole, is the\r\nrolling of those subterranean thunders, which last several months,\r\nwithout being accompanied by the least oscillatory motion of the\r\nground.* (* The subterranean thunders (bramidos y truenos\r\nsubterraneos) of Guanaxuato. The phenomenon of a noise without\r\nshocks was observed by the ancients.--Aristot. Meteor. lib. 2 (ed.\r\nDuval page 802). Pliny lib. 2 c. 80.)\r\n\r\nIn every country subject to earthquakes, the point at which,\r\nprobably owing to a particular disposition of the stony strata, the\r\neffects are most sensibly felt, is considered as the cause and the\r\nfocus of the shocks. Thus, at Cumana, the hill of the castle of San\r\nAntonio, and particularly the eminence on which stands the convent\r\nof St. Francis, are believed to contain an enormous quantity of\r\nsulphur and other inflammable matter. We forget that the rapidity\r\nwith which the undulations are propagated to great distances, even\r\nacross the basin of the ocean, proves that the centre of action is\r\nvery remote from the surface of the globe. From this same cause no\r\ndoubt earthquakes are not confined to certain species of rocks, as\r\nsome naturalists suppose, but all are fitted to propagate the\r\nmovement. Keeping within the limits of my own experience I may here\r\ncite the granites of Lima and Acapulco; the gneiss of Caracas; the\r\nmica-slate of the peninsula of Araya; the primitive thonschiefer of\r\nTepecuacuilco, in Mexico; the secondary limestones of the\r\nApennines, Spain, and New Andalusia; and finally, the trappean\r\nporphyries of the provinces of Quito and Popayan.* (* I might add\r\nto the list of secondary rocks, the gypsum of the newest formation,\r\nfor instance, that of Montmartre, situated on a marine calcareous\r\nrock, which is posterior to the chalk.--See the Memoires de\r\nl'Academie tome 1 page 341 on the earthquake felt at Paris and its\r\nenvirons in 1681.) In these different places the ground is\r\nfrequently agitated by the most violent shocks; but sometimes, in\r\nthe same rock, the superior strata form invincible obstacles to the\r\npropagation of the motion. Thus, in the mines of Saxony, we have\r\nseen workmen hasten up alarmed by oscillations which were not felt\r\nat the surface of the ground.\r\n\r\nIf, in regions the most remote from each other, primitive,\r\nsecondary, and volcanic rocks, share equally in the convulsive\r\nmovements of the globe; we cannot but admit also that within a\r\nspace of little extent, certain classes of rocks oppose themselves\r\nto the propagation of the shocks. At Cumana, for instance, before\r\nthe great catastrophe of 1797, the earthquakes were felt only along\r\nthe southern and calcareous coast of the gulf of Cariaco, as far as\r\nthe town of that name; while in the peninsula of Araya, and at the\r\nvillage of Maniquarez, the ground did not share the same agitation.\r\nBut since December 1797, new communications appear to have been\r\nopened in the interior of the globe. The peninsula of Araya is now\r\nnot merely subject to the same agitations as the soil of Cumana,\r\nbut the promontory of mica-slate, previously free from earthquakes,\r\nhas become in its turn a central point of commotion. The earth is\r\nsometimes strongly shaken at the village of Maniquarez, when on the\r\ncoast of Cumana the inhabitants enjoy the most perfect\r\ntranquillity. The gulf of Cariaco, nevertheless, is only sixty or\r\neighty fathoms deep.\r\n\r\nIt has been thought from observations made both on the continent\r\nand in the islands, that the western and southern coasts are most\r\nexposed to shocks. This observation is connected with opinions\r\nwhich geologists have long formed respecting the position of the\r\nhigh chains of mountains, and the direction of their steepest\r\ndeclivities; but the existence of the Cordillera of Caracas, and\r\nthe frequency of the oscillations on the eastern and northern coast\r\nof Terra Firma, in the gulf of Paria, at Carupano, at Cariaco, and\r\nat Cumana, render the accuracy of that opinion doubtful.\r\n\r\nIn New Andalusia, as well as in Chile and Peru, the shocks follow\r\nthe course of the shore, and extend but little inland. This\r\ncircumstance, as we shall soon find, indicates an intimate\r\nconnection between the causes which produce earthquakes and\r\nvolcanic eruptions. If the earth was most agitated on the coasts,\r\nbecause they are the lowest part of the land, why should not the\r\noscillations be equally strong and frequent on those vast savannahs\r\nor prairies,* which are scarcely eight or ten toises above the\r\nlevel of the ocean? (* The Llanos of Cumana, of New Barcelona, of\r\nCalabozo, of Apure, and of Meta.)\r\n\r\nThe earthquakes of Cumana are connected with those of the West\r\nIndia Islands; and it has even been suspected that they have some\r\nconnection with the volcanic phenomena of the Cordilleras of the\r\nAndes. On the 4th of February 1797, the soil of the province of\r\nQuito suffered such a destructive commotion, that near 40,000\r\nnatives perished. At the same period the inhabitants of the eastern\r\nAntilles were alarmed by shocks, which continued during eight\r\nmonths, when the volcano of Guadaloupe threw out pumice-stones,\r\nashes, and gusts of sulphureous vapours. The eruption of the 27th\r\nof September, during which very long-continued subterranean noises\r\nwere heard, was followed on the 14th of December by the great\r\nearthquake of Cumana. Another volcano of the West India Islands,\r\nthat of St. Vincent, affords an example of these extraordinary\r\nconnections. This volcano had not emitted flames since 1718, when\r\nthey burst forth anew in 1812. The total ruin of the city of\r\nCaracas preceded this explosion thirty-five days, and violent\r\noscillations of the ground were felt both in the islands and on the\r\ncoasts of Terra Firma.\r\n\r\nIt has long been remarked that the effects of great earthquakes\r\nextend much farther than the phenomena arising from burning\r\nvolcanoes. In studying the physical revolutions of Italy, in\r\ncarefully examining the series of the eruptions of Vesuvius and\r\nEtna, we can scarcely recognise, notwithstanding the proximity of\r\nthese mountains, any traces of a simultaneous action. It is on the\r\ncontrary beyond a doubt, that at the period of the last and\r\npreceding destruction of Lisbon,* the sea was violently agitated\r\neven as far as the New World, for instance, at the island of\r\nBarbados, more than twelve hundred leagues distant from the coasts\r\nof Portugal.\r\n\r\n(* Destruction of Lisbon: The 1st of November, 1755, and 31st of\r\nMarch, 1761. During the first of these earthquakes, the sea\r\ninundated, in Europe, the coasts of Sweden, England, and Spain; in\r\nAmerica, the islands of Antigua, Barbados, and Martinique. At\r\nBarbados, where the ordinary tides rise only from twenty-four to\r\ntwenty-eight inches, the water rose twenty feet in Carlisle Bay. It\r\nbecame at the same time as black as ink; being, without doubt,\r\nmixed with the petroleum, or asphaltum, which abounds at the bottom\r\nof the sea, as well on the coasts of the gulf of Cariaco, as near\r\nthe island of Trinidad. In the West Indies, and in several lakes of\r\nSwitzerland, this extraordinary motion of the waters was observed\r\nsix hours after the first shock that was felt at\r\nLisbon--Philosophical Transactions volume 49 pages 403, 410, 544,\r\n668; ibid. volume 53 page 424. At Cadiz a mountain of water sixty\r\nfeet high was seen eight miles distant at sea. This mass threw\r\nitself impetuously on the coasts, and beat down a great number of\r\nhouses; like the wave eighty-four feet high, which on the 9th of\r\nJune, 1586, at the time of the great earthquake of Lima, covered\r\nthe port of Callao.--Acosta Hist. Natural de las Indias edition de\r\n1591 page 123. In North America, on Lake Ontario, violent\r\nagitations of the water were observed from the month of October\r\n1755. These phenomena are proofs of subterraneous communications at\r\nenormous distances. On comparing the periods of the great\r\ncatastrophes of Lima and Guatimala, which generally succeed each\r\nother at long intervals, it has sometimes been thought, that the\r\neffect of an action slowly propagating along the Cordilleras,\r\nsometimes from north to south, at other times from south to north,\r\nmay be perceived.--Cosmo Bueno Descripcion del Peru ed. de Lima\r\npage 67. Four of these remarkable catastrophes, with their dates,\r\nmay be here enumerated.)\r\n\r\nTABLE OF FOUR CATASTROPHES:\r\n\r\nCOLUMN 1 : MEXICO. (Latitude 13 degrees 32 minutes north.)\r\n\r\nCOLUMN 2 : PERU. (Latitude 12 degrees 2 minutes south.)\r\n\r\n  30th of November, 1577  : 17th of June, 1578.\r\n\r\n  4th of March, 1679      : 17th of June, 1678.\r\n\r\n  12th of February, 1689  : 10th of October, 1688.\r\n\r\n  27th of September, 1717 : 8th of February, 1716.\r\n\r\nWhen the shocks are not simultaneous, or do not follow each other\r\nat short intervals, great doubts may be entertained with respect to\r\nthe supposed communication of the movement.)\r\n\r\nSeveral facts tend to prove that the causes which produce\r\nearthquakes have a near connection with those which act in volcanic\r\neruptions. The connection of these causes was known to the\r\nancients, and it excited fresh attention at the period of the\r\ndiscovery of America. The discovery of the New World not only\r\noffered new productions to the curiosity of man, it also extended\r\nthe then existing stock of knowledge respecting physical geography,\r\nthe varieties of the human species, and the migrations of nations.\r\nIt is impossible to read the narratives of early Spanish\r\ntravellers, especially that of the Jesuit Acosta, without\r\nperceiving the influence which the aspect of a great continent, the\r\nstudy of extraordinary appearances of nature, and intercourse with\r\nmen of different races, must have exercised on the progress of\r\nknowledge in Europe. The germ of a great number of physical truths\r\nis found in the works of the sixteenth century; and that germ would\r\nhave fructified, had it not been crushed by fanaticism and\r\nsuperstition. We learned, at Pasto, that the column of black and\r\nthick smoke, which, in 1797, issued for several months from the\r\nvolcano near that shore, disappeared at the very hour, when, sixty\r\nleagues to the south, the towns of Riobamba, Hambato, and Tacunga\r\nwere destroyed by an enormous shock. In the interior of a burning\r\ncrater, near those hillocks formed by ejections of scoriae and\r\nashes, the motion of the ground is felt several seconds before each\r\npartial eruption takes place. We observed this phenomenon at\r\nVesuvius in 1805, while the mountain threw out incandescent\r\nscoriae; we were witnesses of it in 1802, on the brink of the\r\nimmense crater of Pichincha, from which, nevertheless, at that\r\ntime, clouds of sulphureous acid vapours only issued.\r\n\r\nEverything in earthquakes seems to indicate the action of elastic\r\nfluids seeking an outlet to diffuse themselves in the atmosphere.\r\nOften, on the coasts of the Pacific, the action is almost\r\ninstantaneously communicated from Chile to the gulf of Guayaquil, a\r\ndistance of six hundred leagues; and, what is very remarkable, the\r\nshocks appear to be the stronger in proportion as the country is\r\ndistant from burning volcanoes. The granitic mountains of Calabria,\r\ncovered with very recent breccias, the calcareous chain of the\r\nApennines, the country of Pignerol, the coasts of Portugal and\r\nGreece, those of Peru and Terra Firma, afford striking proofs of\r\nthis fact. The globe, it may be said, is agitated with the greater\r\nforce, in proportion as the surface has a smaller number of funnels\r\ncommunicating with the caverns of the interior. At Naples and at\r\nMessina, at the foot of Cotopaxi and of Tunguragua, earthquakes are\r\ndreaded only when vapours and flames do not issue from the craters.\r\nIn the kingdom of Quito, the great catastrophe of Riobamba led\r\nseveral well-informed persons to think that that country would be\r\nless frequently disturbed, if the subterranean fire should break\r\nthe porphyritic dome of Chimborazo; and if that colossal mountain\r\nshould become a burning volcano. At all times analogous facts have\r\nled to the same hypotheses. The Greeks, who, like ourselves,\r\nattributed the oscillations of the ground to the tension of elastic\r\nfluids, cited in favour of their opinion, the total cessation of\r\nthe shocks at the island of Euboea, by the opening of a crevice in\r\nthe Lelantine plain.* (* \"The shocks ceased only when a crevice,\r\nwhich ejected a river of fiery mud, opened in the plain of\r\nLelantum, near Chalcis.\"--Strabo.)\r\n\r\nThe phenomena of volcanoes, and those of earthquakes, have been\r\nconsidered of late as the effects of voltaic electricity, developed\r\nby a particular disposition of heterogeneous strata. It cannot be\r\ndenied, that often, when violent shocks succeed each other within\r\nthe space of a few hours, the electricity of the air sensibly\r\nincreases at the instant the ground is most agitated; but to\r\nexplain this phenomenon, it is unnecessary to recur to an\r\nhypothesis, which is in direct contradiction to everything hitherto\r\nobserved respecting the structure of our planet, and the\r\ndisposition of its strata.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.5.\r\n\r\nPENINSULA OF ARAYA.\r\nSALT-MARSHES.\r\nRUINS OF THE CASTLE OF SANTIAGO.\r\n\r\nTHE first weeks of our abode at Cumana were employed in testing our\r\ninstruments, in herborizing in the neighbouring plains, and in\r\nexamining the traces of the earthquake of the 14th of December,\r\n1797. Overpowered at once by a great number of objects, we were\r\nsomewhat embarrassed how to lay down a regular plan of study and\r\nobservation. Whilst every surrounding object was fitted to inspire\r\nin us the most lively interest, our physical and astronomical\r\ninstruments in their turns excited strongly the curiosity of the\r\ninhabitants. We had numerous visitors; and in our desire to satisfy\r\npersons who appeared so happy to see the spots of the moon through\r\nDollond's telescope, the absorption of two gases in a eudiometrical\r\ntube, or the effects of galvanism on the motions of a frog, we were\r\nobliged to answer questions often obscure, and to repeat for whole\r\nhours the same experiments. These scenes were renewed for the space\r\nof five years, whenever we took up our abode in a place where it\r\nwas understood that we were in possession of microscopes,\r\ntelescopes, and electrical apparatus.\r\n\r\nI could not begin a regular course of astronomical observations\r\nbefore the 28th of July, though it was highly important for me to\r\nknow the longitude given by Berthoud's time-keeper; but it\r\nhappened, that in a country where the sky is constantly clear and\r\nserene, no stars appeared for several nights. The whole series of\r\nthe observations I made in 1799 and 1800 give for their results,\r\nthat the latitude of the great square at Cumana is 10 degrees 27\r\nminutes 52 seconds, and its longitude 66 degrees 30 minutes 2\r\nseconds. This longitude is founded on the difference of time, on\r\nlunar distances, on the eclipse of the sun (on the 28th of October,\r\n1799), and on ten immersions of Jupiter's satellites, compared with\r\nobservations made in Europe. The oldest chart we have of the\r\ncontinent, that of Don Diego Ribeiro, geographer to the emperor\r\nCharles the Fifth, places Cumana in latitude 9 degrees 30 minutes;\r\nwhich differs fifty-eight minutes from the real latitude, and half\r\na degree from that marked by Jefferies in his American Pilot,\r\npublished in 1794. During three centuries the whole of the coast\r\nof Terra Firma has been laid down too far to the south: this has\r\nbeen owing to the current near the island of Trinidad, which sets\r\ntoward the north, and mariners are led by their dead-reckoning to\r\nthink themselves farther south than they really are.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of August a halo round the moon fixed the attention of\r\nthe inhabitants of Cumana, who considered it as the presage of some\r\nviolent earthquake; for, according to popular notions, all\r\nextraordinary phenomena are immediately connected with each other.\r\nColoured circles around the moon are much more rare in northern\r\ncountries than in Provence, Italy, and Spain. They are seen\r\nparticularly (and this fact is singular enough) when the sky is\r\nclear, and the weather seems to be most fair and settled. Under the\r\ntorrid zone beautiful prismatic colours appear almost every night,\r\nand even at the time of the greatest droughts; often in the space\r\nof a few minutes they disappear several times, because, doubtless,\r\nthe superior currents change the state of the floating vapours, by\r\nwhich the light is refracted. I sometimes even observed, between\r\nthe fifteenth degree of latitude and the equator, small halos\r\naround the planet Venus; the purple, orange, and violet, were\r\ndistinctly perceived: but I never saw any colours around Sirius,\r\nCanopus, or Acherner.\r\n\r\nWhile the halo was visible at Cumana, the hygrometer denoted great\r\nhumidity; nevertheless the vapours appeared so perfectly in\r\nsolution, or rather so elastic and uniformly disseminated, that\r\nthey did not alter the transparency of the atmosphere. The moon\r\narose after a storm of rain, behind the castle of San Antonio. As\r\nsoon as she appeared on the horizon, we distinguished two circles:\r\none large and whitish, forty-four degrees in diameter; the other a\r\nsmall circle of 1 degree 43 minutes, displaying all the colours of\r\nthe rainbow. The space between the two circles was of the deepest\r\nazure. At four degrees height, they disappeared, while the\r\nmeteorological instruments indicated not the slightest change in\r\nthe lower regions of the air. This phenomenon had nothing\r\nextraordinary, except the great brilliancy of the colours, added to\r\nthe circumstance, that, according to the measures taken with\r\nRamsden's sextant, the lunar disk was not exactly in the centre of\r\nthe haloes. Without this actual measurement we might have thought\r\nthat the excentricity was the effect of the projection of the\r\ncircles on the apparent concavity of the sky.\r\n\r\nIf the situation of our house at Cumana was highly favourable for\r\nthe observation of the stars and meteorological phenomena, it\r\nobliged us to be sometimes the witnesses of painful scenes during\r\nthe day. A part of the great square is surrounded with arcades,\r\nabove which is one of those long wooden galleries, common in warm\r\ncountries. This was the place where slaves, brought from the coast\r\nof Africa, were sold. Of all the European governments Denmark was\r\nthe first, and for a long time the only power, which abolished the\r\ntraffic; yet notwithstanding that fact, the first negroes we saw\r\nexposed for sale had been landed from a Danish slave-ship. What are\r\nthe duties of humanity, national honour, or the laws of their\r\ncountry, to men stimulated by the speculations of sordid interest?\r\n\r\nThe slaves exposed to sale were young men from fifteen to twenty\r\nyears of age. Every morning cocoa-nut oil was distributed among\r\nthem, with which they rubbed their bodies, to give their skin a\r\nblack polish. The persons who came to purchase examined the teeth\r\nof these slaves, to judge of their age and health; forcing open\r\ntheir mouths as we do those of horses in a market. This odious\r\ncustom dates from Africa, as is proved by the faithful pictures\r\ndrawn by the inimitable Cervantes,* who after his long captivity\r\namong the Moors, described the sale of Christian slaves at Algiers.\r\n(* El Trato de Argel. Jorn. 2 Viage al Parnasso 1784 page 316.) It\r\nis distressing to think that even at this day there exist European\r\ncolonists in the West Indies who mark their slaves with a hot iron,\r\nto know them again if they escape. This is the treatment bestowed\r\non those \"who save other men the labour of sowing, tilling, and\r\nreaping.\"* (* La Bruyere Caracteres edition 1765 chapter 11 page\r\n300. I will here cite a passage strongly characteristic of La\r\nBruyere's benevolent feeling for his fellow-creatures. \"We find\r\n(under the torrid zone) certain wild animals, male and female,\r\nscattered through the country, black, livid, and all over scorched\r\nby the sun, bent to the earth which they dig and turn up with\r\ninvincible perseverance. They have something like articulate\r\nutterance; and when they stand up on their feet, they exhibit a\r\nhuman face, and in fact these creatures are men.\")\r\n\r\nIn 1800 the number of slaves did not exceed six thousand in the two\r\nprovinces of Cumana and Barcelona, when at the same period the\r\nwhole population was estimated at one hundred and ten thousand\r\ninhabitants. The trade in African slaves, which the laws of the\r\nSpaniards have never favoured, is almost as nothing on these coasts\r\nwhere the trade in American slaves was carried on in the sixteenth\r\ncentury with desolating activity. Macarapan, anciently called\r\nAmaracapana, Cumana, Araya, and particularly New Cadiz, built on\r\nthe islet of Cubagua, might then be considered as commercial\r\nestablishments for facilitating the slave trade. Girolamo Benzoni\r\nof Milan, who at the age of twenty-two visited Terra Firma, took\r\npart in some expeditions in 1542 to the coasts of Bordones,\r\nCariaco, and Paria, to carry off the unfortunate natives, he\r\nrelates with simplicity, and often with a sensibility not common in\r\nthe historians of that time, the examples of cruelty of which he\r\nwas a witness. He saw the slaves dragged to New Cadiz, to be marked\r\non the forehead and on the arms, and for the payment of the quint\r\nto the officers of the crown. From this port the Indians were sent\r\nto the island of Haiti or St. Domingo, after having often changed\r\nmasters, not by way of sale, but because the soldiers played for\r\nthem at dice.\r\n\r\nThe first excursion we made was to the peninsula of Araya, and\r\nthose countries formerly celebrated for the slave-trade and the\r\npearl-fishery. We embarked on the Rio Manzanares, near the Indian\r\nsuburb, on the 19th of August, about two in the morning. The\r\nprincipal objects of this excursion were, to see the ruins of the\r\ncastle of Araya, to examine the salt-works, and to make a few\r\ngeological observations on the mountains forming the narrow\r\npeninsula of Maniquarez. The night was delightfully cool; swarms of\r\nphosphorescent insects* glistened in the air (* Elater noctilucus.\r\n), and over a soil covered with sesuvium, and groves of mimosa\r\nwhich bordered the river. We know how common the glow-worm* (*\r\nLampyris italica, L. noctiluca.) is in Italy and in all the south\r\nof Europe, but the picturesque effect it produces cannot be\r\ncompared to those innumerable, scattered, and moving lights, which\r\nembellish the nights of the torrid zone, and seem to repeat on the\r\nearth, along the vast extent of the savannahs, the brilliancy of\r\nthe starry vault of heaven.\r\n\r\nWhen, on descending the river, we drew near plantations, or charas,\r\nwe saw bonfires kindled by the negroes. A light and undulating\r\nsmoke rose to the tops of the palm-trees, and imparted a reddish\r\nhue to the disk of the moon. It was on a Sunday night, and the\r\nslaves were dancing to the music of the guitar. The people of\r\nAfrica, of negro race, are endowed with an inexhaustible store of\r\nactivity and gaiety. After having ended the labours of the week,\r\nthe slaves, on festival days, prefer to listless sleep the\r\nrecreations of music and dancing.\r\n\r\nThe bark in which we passed the gulf of Cariaco was very spacious.\r\nLarge skins of the jaguar, or American tiger, were spread for our\r\nrepose during the night. Though we had yet scarcely been two months\r\nin the torrid zone, we had already become so sensible to the\r\nsmallest variation of temperature that the cold prevented us from\r\nsleeping; while, to our surprise, we saw that the centigrade\r\nthermometer was as high as 21.8 degrees. This fact is familiar to\r\nthose who have lived long in the Indies, and is worthy the\r\nattention of physiologists. Bouguer relates, that when he reached\r\nthe summit of Montagne Pelee, in the island of Martinique, he and\r\nhis companions shivered with cold, though the heat was above 21.5\r\ndegrees. In reading the interesting narrative of captain Bligh,\r\nwho, in consequence of a mutiny on board the Bounty, was forced to\r\nmake a voyage of twelve hundred leagues in an open boat, we find\r\nthat that navigator, in the tenth and twelfth degrees of south\r\nlatitude, suffered much more from cold than from hunger. During our\r\nabode at Guayaquil, in the month of January 1803, we observed that\r\nthe natives covered themselves, and complained of the cold, when\r\nthe thermometer sank to 23.8 degrees, whilst they felt the heat\r\nsuffocating at 30.5 degrees. Six or seven degrees were sufficient\r\nto cause the opposite sensations of cold and heat; because, on\r\nthese coasts of South America, the ordinary temperature of the\r\natmosphere is twenty-eight degrees. The humidity, which modifies\r\nthe conducting power of the air for heat, contributes greatly to\r\nthese impressions. In the port of Guayaquil, as everywhere else in\r\nthe low regions of the torrid zone, the weather grows cool only\r\nafter storms of rain: and I have observed that when the thermometer\r\nsinks to 23.8 degrees, De Luc's hygrometer keeps up to fifty and\r\nfifty-two degrees; it is, on the contrary, at thirty-seven degrees\r\nin a temperature of 30.5 degrees. At Cumana, during very heavy\r\nshowers, people in the streets are heard exclaiming, que hielo!\r\nestoy emparamado;* though the thermometer exposed to the rain sinks\r\nonly to 21.5 degrees. (* \"What an icy cold! I shiver as if I was on\r\nthe top of the mountains.\" The provincial word emparamarse can be\r\ntranslated only by a very long periphrasis. Paramo, in Peruvian\r\npuna, is a denomination found on all the maps of Spanish America.\r\nIn the colonies it signifies neither a desert nor a heath, but a\r\nmountainous place covered with stunted trees, exposed to the winds,\r\nand in which a damp cold perpetually reigns. In the torrid zone,\r\nthe paramos are generally from one thousand six hundred to two\r\nthousand toises high. Snow often falls on them, but it remains only\r\na few hours; for we must not confound, as geographers often do, the\r\nwords paramo and puna with that of nevado, in Peruvian ritticapa, a\r\nmountain which enters into the limits of perpetual snow. These\r\nnotions are highly interesting to geology and the geography of\r\nplants; because, in countries where no height has been measured, we\r\nmay form an exact idea of the lowest height to which the\r\nCordilleras rise, on looking into the map for the words paramo and\r\nnevado. As the paramos are almost continually enveloped in a cold\r\nand thick fog, the people say at Santa Fe and at Mexico, cae un\r\nparamito when a thick small rain falls, and the temperature of the\r\nair sinks considerably. From paramo has been made emparamarse,\r\nwhich signifies to be as cold as if we were on the ridge of the\r\nAndes.) From these observations it follows, that between the\r\ntropics, in plains where the temperature of the air is in the\r\nday-time almost invariably above twenty-seven degrees, warmer\r\nclothing during the night is requisite, whenever in a damp air the\r\nthermometer sinks four or five degrees.\r\n\r\nWe landed about eight in the morning at the point of Araya, near\r\nthe new salt-works. A solitary house, near a battery of three guns,\r\nthe only defence of this coast, since the destruction of the fort\r\nof Santiago, is the abode of the inspector. It is surprising that\r\nthese salt-works, which formerly excited the jealousy of the\r\nEnglish, Dutch, and other maritime powers, have not created a\r\nvillage, or even a farm; a few huts only of poor Indian fishermen\r\nare found at the extremity of the point of Araya.\r\n\r\nThis spot commands a view of the islet of Cubagua, the lofty hills\r\nof Margareta, the ruins of the castle of Santiago, the Cerro de la\r\nVela, and the calcareous chain of the Brigantine, which bounds the\r\nhorizon towards the south. I availed myself of this view to take\r\nthe angles between these different points, from a basis of four\r\nhundred toises, which I measured between the battery and the hill\r\ncalled the Pena. As the Cerro de la Vela, the Brigantine, and the\r\ncastle of San Antonio at Cumana, are equally visible from the Punta\r\nArenas, situated to the west of the village of Maniquarez, the same\r\nobjects were available for an approximate determination of the\r\nrespective positions of several points, which are laid down in the\r\nmineralogical chart of the peninsula of Araya.\r\n\r\nThe abundance of salt contained in the peninsula of Araya was known\r\nto Alonzo Nino, when, following the tracks of Columbus, Ojeda, and\r\nAmerigo Vespucci, he visited these countries in 1499. Though of all\r\nthe people on the globe the natives of South America consume the\r\nleast salt, because they scarcely eat anything but vegetables, it\r\nnevertheless appears, that at an early period the Guayquerias dug\r\ninto the clayey and muriatiferous soil of Punta Arenas. Even the\r\nbrine-pits, now called new, (la salina nueva,) situated at the\r\nextremity of Cape Araya, were worked in very remote times. The\r\nSpaniards, who settled at first at Cubagua, and soon after on the\r\ncoasts of Cumana, worked, from the beginning of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, the salt marshes which stretch away like a lagoon to the\r\nnorth of Cerro de la Vela. As at that period the peninsula of Araya\r\nhad no settled population, the Dutch availed themselves of the\r\nnatural riches of a soil which appeared to be property common to\r\nall nations. In our days, each colony has its own salt-works, and\r\nnavigation is so much improved, that the merchants of Cadiz can\r\nsend, at a small expense, salt from Spain and Portugal to the\r\nsouthern hemisphere, a distance of 1900 leagues, to cure meat at\r\nMonte Video and Buenos Ayres. These advantages were unknown at the\r\ntime of the conquest; colonial industry had then made so little\r\nprogress, that the salt of Araya was carried, at great expense, to\r\nthe West India Islands, Carthagena, and Portobello. In 1605, the\r\ncourt of Madrid sent armed ships to Punta Araya, with orders to\r\nexpel the Dutch by force of arms. The Dutch, however, continued to\r\ncarry on a contraband trade in salt till, in 1622, there was built\r\nnear the salt-works a fort, which afterwards became celebrated\r\nunder the name of the Castillo de Santiago, or the Real Fuerza de\r\nAraya. The great salt-marshes are laid down on the oldest Spanish\r\nmaps, sometimes as a bay, and at other times as a lagoon. Laet, who\r\nwrote his Orbis Novus in 1633, and who had some excellent notions\r\nrespecting these coasts, expressly states, that the lagoon was\r\nseparated from the sea by an isthmus above the level of high water.\r\nIn 1726, an impetuous hurricane destroyed the salt-works of Araya,\r\nand rendered the fort, the construction of which had cost more than\r\na million of piastres, useless. This hurricane was a very rare\r\nphenomenon in these regions, where the sea is in general as calm as\r\nthe water in our large rivers. The waves overflowed the land to a\r\ngreat extent; and by the effect of this eruption of the ocean the\r\nsalt lake was converted into a gulf several miles in length. Since\r\nthat period, artificial reservoirs, or pits, (vasets,) have been\r\nformed, to the north of the range of hills which separates the\r\ncastle from the north coast of the peninsula.\r\n\r\nThe consumption of salt amounted, in 1799 and 1800, in the two\r\nprovinces of Cumana* and Barcelona, to nine or ten thousand\r\nfanegas, each sixteen arrobas, or four hundredweight. This\r\nconsumption is very considerable, and gives, if we deduct from the\r\ntotal population fifty thousand Indians, who eat very little salt,\r\nsixty pounds for each person. Salt beef, called tasajo, is the most\r\nimportant article of export from Barcelona. Of nine or ten thousand\r\nfanegas furnished by the two provinces conjointly, three thousand\r\nonly are produced by the salt-works of Araya; the rest is extracted\r\nfrom the sea-water at the Morro of Barcelona, at Pozuelos, at\r\nPiritu, and in the Golfo Triste. In Mexico, the salt lake of Penon\r\nBlanco alone furnishes yearly more than two hundred and fifty\r\nthousand fanegas of unpurified salt. (* At the period of my visit\r\nto that country the government of Cumana comprehended the two\r\nprovinces of New Andalusia and New Barcelona. The words province\r\nand govierno, or government of Cumana, are consequently not\r\nsynonymous. A Catalonian, Juan de Urpin, who had been by turns a\r\ncanon, a doctor of laws, a counsellor in St. Domingo, and a private\r\nsoldier in the castle of Araya, founded in 1636, the city of New\r\nBarcelona, and attempted to give the name of New Catalonia (Nueva\r\nCathaluna) to the province of which this newly constructed city\r\nbecame the capital. This attempt was fruitless; and it is from the\r\ncapital that the whole province took its name. Since my departure\r\nfrom America, it has been raised to the rank of a Govierno. In New\r\nAndalusia, the Indian name of Cumana has superseded the names Nueva\r\nToledo and Nueva Cordoba, which we find on the maps of the\r\nseventeenth century.)\r\n\r\nThe province of Caracas possesses fine salt-works at Los Roques;\r\nthose which formerly existed at the small island of Tortuga, where\r\nthe soil is strongly impregnated with muriate of soda, were\r\ndestroyed by order of the Spanish government. A canal was made by\r\nwhich the sea has free access to the salt-marshes. Foreign nations\r\nwho have colonies in the West Indies frequented this uninhabited\r\nisland; and the court of Madrid, from views of suspicious policy,\r\nwas apprehensive that the salt-works of Tortuga would give rise to\r\nsettlements, by means of which an illicit trade would be carried on\r\nwith Terra Firma.\r\n\r\nThe royal administration of the salt-works of Araya dates only from\r\nthe year 1792. Before that period they were in the hands of Indian\r\nfishermen, who manufactured salt at their pleasure, and sold it,\r\npaying the government the moderate sum of three hundred piastres.\r\nThe price of the fanega was then four reals;* (* In this narrative,\r\nas well as in the Political Essay on New Spain, all the prices are\r\nreckoned in piastres, and silver reals (reales de plata). Eight of\r\nthese reals are equivalent to a piastre, or one hundred and five\r\nsous, French money (4 shillings 4 1/2 pence English). Nouv. Esp.\r\nvolume 2 pages 519, 616 and 866.) but the salt was extremely\r\nimpure, grey, mixed with earthy particles, and surcharged with\r\nmuriate and sulphate of magnesia. Since the province of Cumana has\r\nbecome dependent on the intendancia of Caracas, the sale of salt is\r\nunder the control of the excise; and the fanega, which the\r\nGuayquerias sold at half a piastre, costs a piastre and a half.* (*\r\nThe fanega of salt is sold to those Indians and fishermen who do\r\nnot pay the duties (derechos reales), at Punta Araya for six, at\r\nCumana for eight reals. The prices to the other tribes are, at\r\nAraya ten, at Cumana twelve reals.) This augmentation of price is\r\nslightly compensated by greater purity of the salt, and by the\r\nfacility with which the fishermen and farmers can procure it in\r\nabundance during the whole year. The salt-works of Araya yielded to\r\nthe treasury, in 1799, a clear income of eight thousand piastres.\r\n\r\nConsidered as a branch of industry the salt produced here is not of\r\nany great importance, but the nature of the soil which contains the\r\nsalt-marshes is well worthy of attention. In order to obtain a\r\nclear idea of the geological connection existing between this\r\nmuriatiferous soil and the rocks of more ancient formation, we\r\nshall take a general view of the neighbouring mountains of Cumana,\r\nand those of the peninsula of Araya, and the island of Margareta.\r\n\r\nThree great parallel chains extend from east to west. The two most\r\nnortherly chains are primitive, and contain the mica-slates of\r\nMacanao, and the San Juan Valley, of Maniquarez, and of\r\nChuparipari. These we shall distinguish by the names of Cordillera\r\nof the island of Margareta, and Cordillera of Araya. The third\r\nchain, the most southerly of the whole, the Cordillera of the\r\nBrigantine and of the Cocollar, contains rocks only of secondary\r\nformation; and, what is remarkable enough, though analogous to the\r\ngeological constitution of the Alps westward of St. Gothard, the\r\nprimitive chain is much less elevated than that which was composed\r\nof secondary rocks.* (* In New Andalusia, the Cordillera of the\r\nCocollar nowhere contains primitive rocks. If these rocks form the\r\nnucleus of this chain, and rise above the level of the neighbouring\r\nplains, which is scarcely probable, we must suppose that they are\r\nall covered with limestone and sandstone. In the Swiss Alps, on the\r\ncontrary, the chain which is designated under the too vague\r\ndenomination of lateral and calcareous, contains primitive rocks,\r\nwhich, according to the observations of Escher and Leopold von\r\nBuch, are often visible to the height of eight hundred or a\r\nthousand toises.) The sea has separated the two northern\r\nCordilleras, those of the island of Margareta and the peninsula of\r\nAraya; and the small islands of Coche and of Cubagua are remnants\r\nof the land that was submerged. Farther to the south, the vast gulf\r\nCariaco stretches away, like a longitudinal valley formed by the\r\nirruption of the sea, between the two small chains of Araya and the\r\nCocollar, between the mica-slate and the Alpine limestone. We shall\r\nsoon see that the direction of the strata, very regular in the\r\nfirst of these rocks, is not quite parallel with the general\r\ndirection of the gulf. In the high Alps of Europe, the great\r\nlongitudinal valley of the Rhone also sometimes cuts at an oblique\r\nangle the calcareous banks in which it has been excavated.\r\n\r\nThe two parallel chains of Araya and the Cocollar were connected,\r\nto the east of the town of Cariaco, between the lakes of Campoma\r\nand Putaquao, by a kind of transverse dyke, which bears the name of\r\nCerro de Meapire, and which in distant times, by resisting the\r\nimpulse of the waves, has hindered the waters of the gulf of\r\nCariaco from uniting with those of the gulf of Paria. Thus, in\r\nSwitzerland, the central chain, that which passes by the Col de\r\nFerrex, the Simplon, St. Gothard, and the Splugen, is connected on\r\nthe north and the south with two lateral chains, by the mountains\r\nof Furca and Maloya. It is interesting to recall to mind those\r\nstriking analogies exhibited in both continents by the external\r\nstructure of the globe.\r\n\r\nThe primitive chain of Araya ends abruptly in the meridian of the\r\nvillage of Maniquarez; and the western slope of the peninsula, as\r\nwell as the plains in the midst of which stands the castle of San\r\nAntonio, is covered with very recent formations of sandstone and\r\nclay mixed with gypsum. Near Maniquarez, breccia or sandstone with\r\ncalcareous cement, which might easily be confounded with real\r\nlimestone, lies immediately over the mica-slate; while on the\r\nopposite side, near Punta Delgada, this sandstone covers a compact\r\nbluish grey limestone, almost destitute of petrifactions, and\r\ntraversed by small veins of calcareous spar. This last rock is\r\nanalogous to the limestone of the high Alps.* (* Alpenkalkstein.)\r\n\r\nThe very recent sandstone formation of the peninsula of Araya\r\ncontains:--first, near Punta Arenas, a stratified sandstone,\r\ncomposed of very fine grains, united by a calcareous cement in\r\nsmall quantity;--secondly, at the Cerro de la Vela, a schistose\r\nsandstone,* (* Sandsteinschiefer.) without mica, and passing into\r\nslate-clay,* (* Thonschiefer.) which accompanies coal;--thirdly, on\r\nthe western side, between Punta Gorda and the ruins of the castle\r\nof Santiago, breccia composed of petrified sea-shells united by a\r\ncalcareous cement, in which are mingled grains of quartz;--fourthly,\r\nnear the point of Barigon, whence the stone employed\r\nfor building at Cumana is obtained, banks of yellowish white shelly\r\nlimestone, in which are found some scattered grains of\r\nquartz;--fifthly, at Penas Negras, at the top of the Cerro de la Vela, a\r\nbluish grey compact limestone, very tender, almost without\r\npetrifactions, and covering the schistose sandstone. However\r\nextraordinary this mixture of sandstone and compact limestone* (*\r\nDichter kalkstein.) may appear, we cannot doubt that these strata\r\nbelong to one and the same formation. The very recent secondary\r\nrocks everywhere present analogous phenomena; the molasse of the\r\nPays de Vaud contains a fetid shelly limestone, and the cerite\r\nlimestone of the banks of the Seine is sometimes mixed with\r\nsandstone.\r\n\r\nThe strata of calcareous breccia are composed of an infinite number\r\nof sea-shells, from four to six inches in diameter, and in part\r\nwell preserved. We find they contain not ammonites, but\r\nampullaires, solens, and terebratulae. The greater part of these\r\nshells are mixed: the oysters and pectinites being sometimes\r\narranged in families. The whole are easily detached, and their\r\ninterior is filled with fossil madrepores and cellepores. We have\r\nnow to speak of a fourth formation, which probably rests* on the\r\ncalcareous sandstone of Araya, I mean the muriatiferous clay. (* It\r\nwere to be wished that mineralogical travellers would examine more\r\nparticularly the Cerro de la Vela. The limestone of the Penas\r\nNegras rests on a slate-clay, mixed with quartzose sand; but there\r\nis no proof of the muriatiferous clay of the salt-works being of\r\nmore ancient formation than this slate-clay, or of its alternating\r\nwith banks of sandstone. No well having been dug in these\r\ncountries, we can have no information respecting the superposition\r\nof the strata. The banks of calcareous sandstone, which are found\r\nat the mouth of the salt lake, and near the fishermen's huts on the\r\ncoast opposite Cape Macano, appeared to me to lie beneath the\r\nmuriatiferous clay.) This clay, hardened, impregnated with\r\npetroleum, and mixed with lamellar and lenticular gypsum, is\r\nanalogous to the salzthon, which in Europe accompanies the sal-gem\r\nof Berchtesgaden, and in South America that of Zipaquira. It is\r\ngenerally of a smoke-grey colour, earthy, and friable; but it\r\nencloses more solid masses of a blackish brown, of a schistose, and\r\nsometimes conchoidal fracture. These fragments, from six to eight\r\ninches long, have an angular form. When they are very small, they\r\ngive the clay a porphyroidal appearance. We find disseminated in\r\nit, as we have already observed, either in nests or in small veins,\r\nselenite, and sometimes, though seldom, fibrous gypsum. It is\r\nremarkable enough, that this stratum of clay, as well as the banks\r\nof pure sal-gem and the salzthon in Europe, scarcely ever contains\r\nshells, while the rocks adjacent exhibit them in great abundance.\r\n\r\nAlthough the muriate of soda is not found visible to the eye in the\r\nclay of Araya, we cannot doubt of its existence. It shows itself in\r\nlarge crystals, if we sprinkle the mass with rain-water and expose\r\nit to the sun. The lagoon to the east of the castle of Santiago\r\nexhibits all the phenomena which have been observed in the salt\r\nlakes of Siberia, described by Lepechin, Gmelin, and Pallas. This\r\nlagoon receives, however, only the rain-waters, which filter\r\nthrough the banks of clay, and unite at the lowest point of the\r\npeninsula. While the lagoon served as a salt-work to the Spaniards\r\nand the Dutch, it did not communicate with the sea; at present this\r\ncommunication has been interrupted anew, by faggots placed at the\r\nplace where the waters of the ocean made an irruption in 1726.\r\nAfter great droughts, crystallized and very pure muriate of soda,\r\nin masses of three or four cubic feet, is still drawn from time to\r\ntime from the bottom of the lagoon. The salt waters of the lake,\r\nexposed to the heat of the sun, evaporate at their surface; crusts\r\nof salt, formed in a saturated solution, fall to the bottom; and by\r\nthe attraction between crystals of a similar nature and form, the\r\ncrystallized masses daily augment. It is generally observed that\r\nthe water is brackish wherever lagoons are formed in clayey ground.\r\nIt is true, that for the new salt-work near the battery of Araya,\r\nthe seawater is received into pits, as in the salt marshes of the\r\nsouth of France; but in the island of Margareta, near Pampatar,\r\nsalt is manufactured by employing only fresh water, with which the\r\nmuriatiferous clay has first been lixiviated.\r\n\r\nWe must not confound the salt disseminated in these clayey soils\r\nwith that contained in the sands of the seashore, on the coasts of\r\nNormandy. These phenomena, considered in a geognostical point of\r\nview, have scarcely any properties in common. I have seen\r\nmuriatiferous clay at the level of the ocean at Punta Araya, and at\r\ntwo thousand toises' height in the Cordilleras of New Grenada. If\r\nin the former of these places it lies on very recent shelly\r\nbreccia, it forms, on the contrary, in Austria near Ischel, a\r\nconsiderable stratum in the Alpine limestone, which, though equally\r\nposterior to the existence of organic life on the globe, is\r\nnevertheless of high antiquity, as is proved by the great number of\r\nrocks with which it is covered. We shall not question, that\r\nsal-gem, either pure or mixed with muriatiferous clay, may have\r\nbeen deposited by an ancient sea; but everything evinces that it\r\nwas formed during an order of things bearing no resemblance to that\r\nin which the sea at present, by a slower operation, deposits a few\r\nparticles of muriate of soda on the sands of our shores. In the\r\nsame manner as sulphur and coal belong to periods of formation very\r\nremote from each other, the sal-gem is also found sometimes in\r\ntransition gypsum,* (* Uebergangsgyps, in the transition slate of\r\nWhite Alley (l'Allee Blanche), and between the grauwacke and black\r\ntransition limestone near Bex, below the Dent de Chamossaire,\r\naccording to M. von Buch.) sometimes in the Alpine limestone,* (*\r\nAt Halle in the Tyrol.) sometimes in a muriatiferous clay lying on\r\na very recent sandstone,* (* At Punta Araya.) and lastly, sometimes\r\nin a gypsum* posterior to the chalk. (* Gypsum of the third\r\nformation among the secondary gypsums. The first formation contains\r\nthe gypsum in which are found the brine-springs of Thuringia, and\r\nwhich is placed either in the Alpine limestone or zechstein, to\r\nwhich it essentially belongs (Freiesleben Geognost. Arbeiten tome 2\r\npage 131), or between the zechstein and the limestone of the Jura,\r\nor between the zechstein and the new sandstone. It is the ancient\r\ngypsum of secondary formation of Werner's school (alterer\r\nflozgyps), which we almost preferably call muriatiferous gypsum.\r\nThe second formation is composed of fibrous gypsum, placed either\r\nin the molasse or new sandstone, or between this and the upper\r\nlimestone. It abounds in common clay, which differs essentially\r\nfrom the salzthon or muriatiferous clay. The third formation of\r\ngypsum is more recent than chalk. To this belongs the bony gypsum\r\nof Paris; and, as appears from the researches of Mr. Steffens\r\n(Geogn. Aufsatsze 1810 page 142), the gypsum of Segeberg, in\r\nHolstein, in which sal-gem is sometimes disseminated in very small\r\nnests (Jenaische Litteratur-Zeitung 1813 page 100). The gypsum of\r\nParis, lying between a cerite limestone, which covers chalk and a\r\nsandstone without shells, is distinguished by fossil bones of\r\nquadrupeds, while the Segeberg and Lunebourg gypsums, the position\r\nof which is more uncertain, are characterized by the boracits which\r\nthey contain. Two other formations, far anterior to the three we\r\nhave just mentioned, are the transition gypsum (ubergangsgyps) of\r\nAigle, and the primitive gypsum (urgyps) of the valley of Canaria,\r\nnear Airolo. I flatter myself that I may render some service to\r\nthose geologists who prefer the knowledge of positive facts to\r\nspeculation on the origin of things, by furnishing them with\r\nmaterials from which they may generalize their ideas on the\r\nformation of rocks in both hemispheres. The relative antiquity of\r\nthe formations is the principal object of a science which is to\r\nrender us acquainted with the structure of the globe; that is to\r\nsay, the nature of the strata which constitute the crust of our\r\nplanet.)\r\n\r\nThe new salt-works of Araya have five reservoirs, or pits, the\r\nlargest of which have two thousand three hundred square toises\r\nsurface. Their mean depth is eight inches. Use is made both of the\r\nrain-water, which by filtration collects at the lowest part of the\r\nplain, and of the water of the sea, which enters by canals, or\r\nmartellieres, when the flood-tide is favoured by the winds. The\r\nsituation of these new salt-works is less advantageous than that of\r\nthe lagoon. The waters which fall into the latter pass over steeper\r\nslopes, washing a greater extent of ground.\r\n\r\nThe earth already lixiviated is never carried away here, as it is\r\nfrom time to time in the island of Margareta; nor have wells been\r\ndug in the muriatiferous clay, with the view of finding strata\r\nricher in muriate of soda. The salineros, or salt-workers generally\r\ncomplain of want of rain; and in the new salt-works, it appears to\r\nme difficult to determine what quantity of salt is derived solely\r\nfrom the waters of the sea. The natives estimate it at a sixth of\r\nthe total produce. The evaporation is extremely strong, and\r\nfavoured by the constant motion of the air; so that the salt is\r\ncollected in eighteen or twenty days after the pits are filled.\r\n\r\nThough the muriate of soda is manufactured with less care in the\r\npeninsula of Araya than at the salt-works of Europe, it is\r\nnevertheless purer, and contains less of earthy muriates and\r\nsulphates. We know not whether this purity may be attributed to\r\nthat portion of the salt which is furnished by the sea; for though\r\nit is extremely probable, that the quantity of salt dissolved in\r\nthe waters of the ocean is nearly the same under every zone, it is\r\nnot less uncertain whether the proportion between the muriate of\r\nsoda, the muriate and sulphate of magnesia, and the sulphate and\r\ncarbonate of lime, be equally invariable.\r\n\r\nHaving examined the salt-works, and terminated our geodesical\r\noperations, we departed at the decline of day to sleep at an Indian\r\nhut, some miles distant, near the ruins of the castle of Araya.\r\nDirecting our course southward, we traversed first the plain\r\ncovered with muriatiferous clay, and stripped of vegetation; then\r\ntwo chains of hills of sandstone, between which the lagoon is\r\nsituated. Night overtook us while we were in a narrow path,\r\nbordered on one side by the sea, and on the other by a range of\r\nperpendicular rocks. The tide was rising rapidly, and narrowed the\r\nroad at every step. We at length arrived at the foot of the old\r\ncastle of Araya, where we enjoyed a prospect that had in it\r\nsomething lugubrious and romantic. The ruins stand on a bare and\r\narid mountain, crowned with agave, columnar cactus, and thorny\r\nmimosas: they bear less resemblance to the works of man, than to\r\nthose masses of rock which were ruptured at the early revolutions\r\nof the globe.\r\n\r\nWe were desirous of stopping to admire this majestic spectacle, and\r\nto observe the setting of Venus, whose disk appeared at intervals\r\nbetween the yawning crannies of the castle; but the muleteer, who\r\nserved as our guide, was parched with thirst, and pressed us\r\nearnestly to return. He had long perceived that we had lost our\r\nway; and as he hoped to work on our fears he continually warned us\r\nof the danger of tigers and rattlesnakes. Venomous reptiles are,\r\nindeed, very common near the castle of Araya; and two jaguars had\r\nbeen lately killed at the entrance of the village of Maniquarez. If\r\nwe might judge from their skins, which were preserved, their size\r\nwas not less than that of the Indian tiger. We vainly represented\r\nto our guide that those animals did not attack men where the goats\r\nfurnished them with abundant prey; we were obliged to yield, and\r\nreturn. After having proceeded three quarters of an hour along a\r\nshore covered by the tide we were joined by the negro, who carried\r\nour provision. Uneasy at not seeing us arrive, he had come to meet\r\nus, and he led us through a wood of nopals to a hut inhabited by an\r\nIndian family. We were received with the cordial hospitality\r\nobserved in this country among people of every tribe. The hut in\r\nwhich we slung our hammocks was very clean; and there we found\r\nfish, plantains, and what in the torrid zone is preferable to the\r\nmost sumptuous food, excellent water.\r\n\r\nThe next day at sunrise we found that the hut in which we had\r\npassed the night formed part of a group of small dwellings on the\r\nborders of the salt lake, the remains of a considerable village\r\nwhich had formerly stood near the castle. The ruins of a church\r\nwere seen partly buried in the sand, and covered with brushwood.\r\nWhen, in 1762, to save the expense of the garrison, the castle of\r\nAraya was totally dismantled, the Indians and Mulattoes who were\r\nsettled in the neighbourhood emigrated by degrees to Maniquarez, to\r\nCariaco, and in the suburb of the Guayquerias at Cumana. A small\r\nnumber, bound from affection to their native soil, remained in this\r\nwild and barren spot. These poor people live by catching fish,\r\nwhich are extremely abundant on the coast and the neighbouring\r\nshoals. They appear satisfied with their condition, and think it\r\nstrange when they are asked why they have no gardens or culinary\r\nvegetables. Our gardens, they reply, are beyond the gulf; when we\r\ncarry our fish to Cumana, we bring back plantains, cocoa-nuts, and\r\ncassava. This system of economy, which favours idleness, is\r\nfollowed at Maniquarez, and throughout the whole peninsula of\r\nAraya. The chief wealth of the inhabitants consists in goats, which\r\nare of a very large and very fine breed, and rove in the fields\r\nlike those at the Peak of Teneriffe. They have become entirely\r\nwild, and are marked like the mules, because it would be difficult\r\nto recognize them from their colour or the arrangement of their\r\nspots. These wild goats are of a brownish yellow, and are not\r\nvaried in colour like domestic animals. If in hunting, a colonist\r\nkills a goat which he does not consider as his own property, he\r\ncarries it immediately to the neighbour to whom it belongs. During\r\ntwo days we heard it everywhere spoken of as a very extraordinary\r\ncircumstance, that an inhabitant of Maniquarez had lost a goat, on\r\nwhich it was probable that a neighbouring family had regaled\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nAmong the Mulattoes, whose huts surround the salt lake, we found it\r\nshoemaker of Castilian descent. He received us with the air of\r\ngravity and self-sufficiency which in those countries characterize\r\nalmost all persons who are conscious of possessing some peculiar\r\ntalent. He was employed in stretching the string of his bow, and\r\nsharpening his arrows to shoot birds. His trade of a shoemaker\r\ncould not be very lucrative in a country where the greater part of\r\nthe inhabitants go barefooted; and he only complained that, on\r\naccount of the dearness of European gunpowder, a man of his quality\r\nwas reduced to employ the same weapons as the Indians. He was the\r\nsage of the plain; he understood the formation of the salt by the\r\ninfluence of the sun and full moon, the symptoms of earthquakes,\r\nthe marks by which mines of gold and silver are discovered, and the\r\nmedicinal plants, which, like all the other colonists from Chile to\r\nCalifornia, he classified into hot and cold.* (* Exciting or\r\ndebilitating, the sthenic and asthenic, of Brown's system.) Having\r\ncollected the traditions of the country, he gave us some curious\r\naccounts of the pearls of Cubagua, objects of luxury, which he\r\ntreated with the utmost contempt. To show us how familiar to him\r\nwere the sacred writings he took a pride in reminding us that Job\r\npreferred wisdom to all the pearls of the Indies. His philosophy\r\nwas circumscribed to the narrow circle of the wants of life. The\r\npossession of a very strong ass, able to carry a heavy load of\r\nplantains to the embarcadero, was the consummation of all his\r\nwishes.\r\n\r\nAfter a long discourse on the emptiness of human greatness, he drew\r\nfrom a leathern pouch a few very small opaque pearls, which he\r\nforced us to accept, enjoining us at the same time to note on our\r\ntablets that a poor shoemaker of Araya, but a white man, and of\r\nnoble Castilian race, had been enabled to give us something which,\r\non the other side of the sea,* was sought for as very precious. (*\r\n'Por alla,' or, 'del otro lado del charco,' (properly 'beyond,' or\r\n'on the other side of the great lake'), a figurative expression, by\r\nwhich the people in the Spanish colonies denote Europe.) I here\r\nacquit myself of the promise I made to this worthy man, who\r\ndisinterestedly refused to accept of the slightest retribution. The\r\nPearl Coast presents the same aspect of misery as the countries of\r\ngold and diamonds, Choco and Brazil; but misery is not there\r\nattended with that immoderate desire of gain which is excited by\r\nmineral wealth.\r\n\r\nThe pearl-breeding oyster (Avicula margaritifera, Cuvier) abounds\r\non the shoals which extend from Cape Paria to Cape la Vela. The\r\nislands of Margareta, Cubagua, Coche, Punta Araya, and the mouth of\r\nthe Rio la Hacha, were, in the sixteenth century, as celebrated as\r\nwere the Persian Gulf and the island of Taprobana among the\r\nancients. It is incorrectly alleged by some historians that the\r\nnatives of America were unacquainted with the luxury of pearls. The\r\nfirst Spaniards who landed in Terra Firma found the savages decked\r\nwith pearl necklaces and bracelets; and among the civilized people\r\nof Mexico and Peru, pearls of a beautiful form were extremely\r\nsought after. I have published a dissertation on the statue of a\r\nMexican priestess in basalt, whose head-dress, resembling the\r\ncalantica of the heads of Isis, is ornamented with pearls. Las\r\nCasas and Benzoni have described, but not without some\r\nexaggeration, the cruelties which were exercised on the unhappy\r\nIndian slaves and negroes employed in the pearl fishery. At the\r\nbeginning of the conquest the island of Coche alone furnished\r\npearls amounting in value to fifteen hundred marks per month.\r\n\r\nThe quint which the king's officers drew from the produce of\r\npearls, amounted to fifteen thousand ducats; which, according to\r\nthe value of the precious metals in those times, and the\r\nextensiveness of contraband trade, may be regarded as a very\r\nconsiderable sum. It appears that till 1530 the value of the pearls\r\nsent to Europe amounted yearly on an average to more than eight\r\nhundred thousand piastres. In order to judge of the importance of\r\nthis branch of commerce to Seville, Toledo, Antwerp, and Genoa, we\r\nshould recollect that at the same period the whole of the mines of\r\nAmerica did not furnish two millions of piastres; and that the\r\nfleet of Ovando was thought to contain immense wealth, because it\r\nhad on board nearly two thousand six hundred marks of silver.\r\nPearls were the more sought after, as the luxury of Asia had been\r\nintroduced into Europe by two ways diametrically opposite: that of\r\nConstantinople, where the Palaeologi wore garments covered with\r\nstrings of pearls; and that of Grenada, the residence of the\r\nMoorish kings, who displayed at their court all the luxury of the\r\nEast. The pearls of the East were preferred to those of the West;\r\nbut the number of the latter which circulated in commerce was\r\nnevertheless considerable at the period immediately following the\r\ndiscovery of America. In Italy as well as in Spain, the islet of\r\nCubagua became the object of numerous mercantile speculations.\r\n\r\nBenzoni* relates the adventure of one Luigi Lampagnano, to whom\r\nCharles the Fifth granted the privilege of proceeding with five\r\ncaravels to the coasts of Cumana to fish for pearls. (* La Hist.\r\ndel Mondo Nuovo page 34. Luigi Lampagnano, a relation of the\r\nassassin of the Duke of Milan, Galeazzo Maria Sforza, could not pay\r\nthe merchants of Seville who had advanced the money for his voyage;\r\nhe remained five years at Cubagua, and died in a fit of insanity.)\r\nThe colonists sent him back with this bold message: \"That the\r\nemperor was too liberal of what was not his own, and that he had no\r\nright to dispose of the oysters which live at the bottom of the\r\nsea.\"\r\n\r\nThe pearl fishery diminished rapidly about the end of the sixteenth\r\ncentury; and, according to Laet, it had long ceased in 1633.* (*\r\n\"Insularum Cubaguae et Coches quondam magna fuit dignitas, quum\r\nUnionum captura floreret: nunc, illa deficiente, obscura admodum\r\nfama.\" Laet Nova Orbis page 669. This accurate compiler, speaking\r\nof Punta Araya, adds, this country is so forgotten, \"ut vix ulla\r\nAmericae meridionalis pars hodie obscurior sit.\") The industry of\r\nthe Venetians, who imitated fine pearls with great exactness, and\r\nthe frequent use of cut diamonds,* rendered the fisheries of\r\nCubagua less lucrative. (* The cutting of diamonds was invented by\r\nLewis de Berquen, in 1456, but the art became common only in the\r\nfollowing century.) At the same time, the oysters which yielded the\r\npearls became scarcer, not, because, according to a popular\r\ntradition, they were frightened by the sound of the oars, and\r\nremoved elsewhere; but because their propagation had been impeded\r\nby the imprudent destruction of the shells by thousands. The\r\npearl-bearing oyster is of a more delicate nature than most of the\r\nother acephalous mollusca. At the island of Ceylon, where, in the\r\nbay of Condeatchy, the fishery employs six hundred divers, and\r\nwhere the annual produce is more than half a million of piastres,\r\nit has vainly been attempted to transplant the oysters to other\r\nparts of the coast. The government permits fishing there only\r\nduring a single month; while at Cubagua the bank of shells was\r\nfished at all seasons. To form an idea of the destruction of the\r\nspecies caused by the divers, we must remember that a boat\r\nsometimes collects, in two or three weeks, more than thirty-five\r\nthousand oysters. The animal lives but nine or ten years; and it is\r\nonly in its fourth year that the pearls begin to show themselves.\r\nIn ten thousand shells there is often not a single pearl of value.\r\nTradition records that on the bank of Margareta the fishermen\r\nopened the shells one by one: in the island of Ceylon the animals\r\nare thrown into heaps to rot in the air; and to separate the pearls\r\nwhich are not attached to the shell, the animal pulp is washed, as\r\nminers wash the sand which contains grains of gold, tin, or\r\ndiamonds.\r\n\r\nAt present Spanish America furnishes no other pearls for trade than\r\nthose of the gulf of Panama, and the mouth of the Rio de la Hacha.\r\nOn the shoals which surround Cubagua, Coche, and the island of\r\nMargareta, the fishery is as much neglected as on the coasts of\r\nCalifornia.* (* I am astonished at never having heard, in the\r\ncourse of my travels, of pearls found in the fresh-water shells of\r\nSouth America, though several species of the Unio genus abound in\r\nthe rivers of Peru.) It is believed at Cumana, that the\r\npearl-oyster has greatly multiplied after two centuries of repose;\r\nand in 1812, some new attempts were made at Margareta for the\r\nfishing of pearls. It has been asked, why the pearls found at\r\npresent in shells which become entangled in the fishermen's nets\r\nare so small, and have so little brilliancy,* whilst, on the\r\nSpaniards' arrival, they were extremely beautiful, though the\r\nIndians doubtless had not taken the trouble of diving to collect\r\nthem. (* The inhabitants of Araya sometimes sell these small pearls\r\nto the retail dealers of Cumana. The ordinary price is one piastre\r\nper dozen.) The problem is so much the more difficult to solve, as\r\nwe know not whether earthquakes may have altered the nature of the\r\nbottom of the sea, or whether the changes of the submarine currents\r\nmay have had an influence either on the temperature of the water,\r\nor on the abundance of certain mollusca on which the Aronde feeds.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 20th our host's son, a young and very robust\r\nIndian, conducted us by the way of Barigon and Caney to the village\r\nof Maniquarez, which was four hours' walk. From the effect of the\r\nreverberation of the sands, the thermometer kept up to 31.3\r\ndegrees. The cylindric cactus, which bordered the road, gave the\r\nlandscape an appearance of verdure, without affording either\r\ncoolness or shade. Before our guide had walked a league, he began\r\nto sit down every moment, and at length he wished to repose under\r\nthe shade of a fine tamarind tree near Casas de la Vela, to await\r\nthe approach of night. This characteristic trait, which we observed\r\nevery time we travelled with Indians, has given rise to very\r\nerroneous ideas of the physical constitutions of the different\r\nraces of men. The copper-coloured native, more accustomed to the\r\nburning heat of the climate, than the European traveller, complains\r\nmore, because he is stimulated by no interest. Money is without\r\nattraction for him; and if he permits himself to be tempted by gain\r\nfor a moment, he repents of his resolution as soon as he is on the\r\nroad. The same Indian, who would complain, when in herborizing we\r\nloaded him with a box filled with plants, would row his canoe\r\nfourteen or fifteen hours together, against the strongest current,\r\nbecause he wished to return to his family. In order to form a true\r\njudgment of the muscular strength of the people, we should observe\r\nthem in circumstances where their actions are determined by a\r\nnecessity and a will equally energetic.\r\n\r\nWe examined the ruins of Santiago,* the structure of which is\r\nremarkable for its extreme solidity. (* On the map accompanying\r\nRobertson's History of America, we find the name of this castle\r\nconfounded with that of Nueva Cordoba. This latter denomination was\r\nformerly synonymous with Cumana.--Herrera, page 14.) The walls of\r\nfreestone, five feet thick, have been blown up by mines; but we\r\nstill found masses of seven or eight hundred feet square, which\r\nhave scarcely a crack in them. Our guide showed us a cistern\r\n(aljibe) thirty feet deep, which, though much damaged, furnishes\r\nwater to the inhabitants of the peninsula of Araya. This cistern\r\nwas finished in 1681, by the governor Don Juan de Padilla\r\nGuardiola, the same who built at Cumana the small fort of Santa\r\nMaria. As the basin is covered with an arched vault, the water,\r\nwhich is of excellent quality, keeps very cool: the confervae,\r\nwhile they decompose the carburetted hydrogen, also shelter worms\r\nwhich hinder the propagation of small insects. It had been believed\r\nfor ages, that the peninsula of Araya was entirely destitute of\r\nsprings of fresh water; but in 1797, after many useless researches,\r\nthe inhabitants of Maniquarez succeeded in discovering some.\r\n\r\nIn crossing the arid hills of Cape Cirial, we perceived a strong\r\nsmell of petroleum. The wind blew from the direction in which the\r\nsprings of this substance are found, and which were mentioned by\r\nthe first historians of these countries.* (* Oviedo terms it \"A\r\nresinous, aromatic, and medicinal liquor.\") Near the village of\r\nManiquarez, the mica-slate* (* The Piedra pelada of the Creoles.)\r\ncomes out from below the secondary rock, forming a chain of\r\nmountains from one hundred and fifty to one hundred and eighty\r\ntoises in height. The direction of the primitive rock near Cape\r\nSotto is from north-east to south-west; its strata incline fifty\r\ndegrees to the north-west. The mica-slate is silvery white, of\r\nlamellar and undulated texture, and contains garnets. Strata of\r\nquartz, the thickness of which varies from three to four toises,\r\ntraverse the mica-slate, as we may observe in several ravines\r\nhollowed out by the waters. We detached with difficulty a fragment\r\nof cyanite from a block of splintered and milky quartz, which was\r\nisolated on the shore. This was the only time we found this\r\nsubstance in South America.* (* In New Spain, the cyanite has been\r\ndiscovered only in the province of Guatimala, at Estancia\r\nGrande,--Del Rio Tablas Min. 1804 page 27.)\r\n\r\nThe potteries of Maniquarez, celebrated from time immemorial, form\r\na branch of industry which is exclusively in the hands of the\r\nIndian women. The manufacture is still carried on according to the\r\nmethod used before the conquest. It indicates both the infancy of\r\nthe art, and that unchangeability of manners which is\r\ncharacteristic of all the natives of America. Three centuries have\r\nbeen insufficient to introduce the potter's-wheel, on a coast which\r\nis not above thirty or forty days' sail from Spain. The natives\r\nhave some confused notions with respect to the existence of this\r\nmachine, and they would no doubt make use of it if it were\r\nintroduced among them. The quarries whence they obtain the clay are\r\nhalf a league to the east of Maniquarez. This clay is produced by\r\nnatural decomposition of a mica-slate reddened by oxide of iron.\r\nThe Indian women prefer the part most abounding in mica; and with\r\ngreat skill fashion vessels two or three feet in diameter, giving\r\nthem a very regular curve. As they are not acquainted with the use\r\nof ovens, they place twigs of desmanthus, cassia, and the\r\narborescent capparis, around the pots, and bake them in the open\r\nair. To the east of the quarry which furnishes the clay is the\r\nravine of La Mina. It is asserted that, a short time after the\r\nconquest, some Venetians extracted gold from the mica-slate. It\r\nappears that this metal was not collected in veins of quartz, but\r\nwas found disseminated in the rock, as it is sometimes in granite\r\nand gneiss.\r\n\r\nAt Maniquarez we met with some creoles, who had been hunting at\r\nCubagua. Deer of a small breed are so common in this uninhabited\r\nislet, that a single individual may kill three or four in a day. I\r\nknow not by what accident these animals have got thither, for Laet\r\nand other chroniclers of these countries, speaking of the\r\nfoundation of New Cadiz, mention only the great abundance of\r\nrabbits. The venado of Cubagua belongs to one of those numerous\r\nspecies of small American deer, which zoologists have long\r\nconfounded under the vague name of Cervus mexicanus. It does not\r\nappear to be the same as the hind of the savannahs of Cayenne, or\r\nthe guazuti of Paraguay, which live also in herds. Its colour is a\r\nbrownish red on the back, and white under the belly; and it is\r\nspotted like the axis. In the plains of Cari we were shown, as a\r\nthing very rare in these hot climates, a variety quite white. It\r\nwas a female of the size of the roebuck of Europe, and of a very\r\nelegant shape. White varieties are found in the New Continent even\r\namong the tigers. Azara saw a jaguar, the skin of which was wholly\r\nwhite, with merely the shadow, as it might be termed, of a few\r\ncircular spots.\r\n\r\nOf all the productions on the coasts of Araya, that which the\r\npeople consider as the most extraordinary, or we may say the most\r\nmarvellous, is 'the stone of the eyes,' (piedra de los ojos.) This\r\ncalcareous substance is a frequent subject of conversation: being,\r\naccording to the natural philosophy of the natives, both a stone\r\nand an animal. It is found in the sand, where it is motionless; but\r\nif placed on a polished surface, for instance on a pewter or\r\nearthen plate, it moves when excited by lemon juice. If placed in\r\nthe eye, the supposed animal turns on itself, and expels every\r\nother foreign substance that has been accidentally introduced. At\r\nthe new salt-works, and at the village of Maniquarez, these stones\r\nof the eyes* were offered to us by hundreds, and the natives were\r\nanxious to show us the experiment of the lemon juice. (* They are\r\nfound in the greatest abundance near the battery at the point of\r\nCape Araya.) They even wished to put sand into our eyes, in order\r\nthat we might ourselves try the efficacy of the remedy. It was easy\r\nto see that the stones are thin and porous opercula, which have\r\nformed part of small univalve shells. Their diameter varies from\r\none to four lines. One of their two surfaces is plane, and the\r\nother convex. These calcareous opercula effervesce with lemon\r\njuice, and put themselves in motion in proportion as the carbonic\r\nacid is disengaged. By the effect of a similar reaction, loaves\r\nplaced in an oven move sometimes on a horizontal plane; a\r\nphenomenon that has given occasion, in Europe, to the popular\r\nprejudice of enchanted ovens. The piedras de los ojos, introduced\r\ninto the eye, act like the small pearls, and different round grains\r\nemployed by the American savages to increase the flowing of tears.\r\nThese explanations were little to the taste of the inhabitants of\r\nAraya. Nature has the appearance of greatness to man in proportion\r\nas she is veiled in mystery; and the ignorant are prone to put\r\nfaith in everything that borders on the marvellous.\r\n\r\nProceeding along the southern coast, to the east of Maniquarez, we\r\nfind running out into the sea very near each other, three strips of\r\nland, bearing the names of Punta de Soto, Punta de la Brea, and\r\nPunta Guaratarito. In these parts the bottom of the sea is\r\nevidently formed of mica-slate, and from it near Cape de la Brea,\r\nbut at eighty feet distant from the shore, there issues a spring of\r\nnaphtha, the smell of which penetrates into the interior of the\r\npeninsula. It is necessary to wade into the sea up to the waist, to\r\nexamine this interesting phenomenon. The waters are covered with\r\nzostera; and in the midst of a very extensive bank of weeds, we\r\ndistinguish a free and circular spot of three feet in diameter, on\r\nwhich float a few scattered masses of Ulva lactuca. Here the\r\nsprings are found. The bottom of the gulf is covered with sand; and\r\nthe petroleum, which, from its transparency and its yellow colour,\r\nresembles naphtha, rises in jets, accompanied by air bubbles. On\r\ntreading down the bottom with the foot, we perceive that these\r\nlittle springs change their place. The naphtha covers the surface\r\nof the sea to more than a thousand feet distant. If we suppose the\r\ndip of the strata to be regular, the mica-slate must be but a few\r\ntoises below the sand.\r\n\r\nWe have already observed, that the muriatiferous clay of Araya\r\ncontains solid and friable petroleum. This geological connection\r\nbetween the muriate of soda and the bitumens is evident wherever\r\nthere are mines of sal-gem or salt springs: but a very remarkable\r\nfact is the existence of a fountain of naphtha in a primitive\r\nformation. All those hitherto known belong to secondary mountains;*\r\n(* As at Pietra Mala; Fanano; Mont Zibio; and Amiano (in these\r\nplaces are found the springs that furnish the naphtha burned in\r\nlamps in Genoa) and also at Baikal.) a circumstance which has been\r\nsupposed to favour the idea that all mineral bitumens are owing to\r\nthe destruction of vegetables and animals, or to the burning of\r\ncoal. In the peninsula of Araya, the naphtha flows from the\r\nprimitive rock itself; and this phenomenon acquires new importance,\r\nwhen we recollect that the same primitive rocks contain the\r\nsubterranean fires, that on the brink of burning craters the smell\r\nof petroleum is perceived from time to time, and that the greater\r\npart of the hot springs of America rise from gneiss and micaceous\r\nschist.\r\n\r\nAfter having examined the environs of Maniquarez, we embarked at\r\nnight in a fishing-boat for Cumana. The small crazy boats employed\r\nby the natives here, bear testimony to the extreme calmness of the\r\nsea in these regions. Our boat, though the best we could procure,\r\nwas so leaky, that the pilot's son was constantly employed in\r\nbaling out the water with a tutuma, or shell of the Crescentia\r\ncujete (calabash). It often happens in the gulf of Cariaco, and\r\nespecially to the north of the peninsula of Araya, that canoes\r\nladen with cocoa-nuts are upset in sailing too near the wind, and\r\nagainst the tide.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Araya, whom we visited a second time on\r\nreturning from the Orinoco, have not forgotten that their peninsula\r\nwas one of the points first peopled by the Spaniards. They love to\r\ntalk of the pearl fishery; of the ruins of the castle of Santiago,\r\nwhich they hope to see some day rebuilt; and of everything that\r\nrecalls to mind the ancient splendour of those countries. In China\r\nand Japan those inventions are considered as recent, which have not\r\nbeen known above two thousand years; in the European colonies an\r\nevent appears extremely old, if it dates back three centuries, or\r\nabout the period of the discovery of America.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.6.\r\n\r\nMOUNTAINS OF NEW ANDALUCIA.\r\nVALLEY OF THE CUMANACOA.\r\nSUMMIT OF THE COCOLLAR.\r\nMISSIONS OF THE CHAYMA INDIANS.\r\n\r\nOur first visit to the peninsula of Araya was soon succeeded by an\r\nexcursion to the mountains of the missions of the Chayma Indians,\r\nwhere a variety of interesting objects claimed our attention. We\r\nentered on a country studded with forests, and visited a convent\r\nsurrounded by palm-trees and arborescent ferns. It was situated in\r\na narrow valley, where we felt the enjoyment of a cool and\r\ndelicious climate, in the centre of the torrid zone. The\r\nsurrounding mountains contain caverns haunted by thousands of\r\nnocturnal birds; and, what affects the imagination more than all\r\nthe wonders of the physical world, we find beyond these mountains a\r\npeople lately nomad, and still nearly in a state of nature, wild\r\nwithout being barbarous. It was in the promontory of Paria that\r\nColumbus first descried the continent; there terminate these\r\nvalleys, laid waste alternately by the warlike anthropophagic Carib\r\nand by the commercial and polished nations of Europe. At the\r\nbeginning of the sixteenth century the ill-fated Indians of the\r\ncoasts of Carupano, of Macarapan, and of Caracas, were treated in\r\nthe same manner as the inhabitants of the coast of Guinea in our\r\ndays. The soil of the islands was cultivated, the vegetable produce\r\nof the Old World was transplanted thither, but a regular system of\r\ncolonization remained long unknown on the New Continent. If the\r\nSpaniards visited its shores, it was only to procure, either by\r\nviolence or exchange, slaves, pearls, grains of gold, and\r\ndye-woods; and endeavours were made to ennoble the motives of this\r\ninsatiable avarice by the pretence of enthusiastic zeal in the\r\ncause of religion.\r\n\r\nThe trade in the copper-coloured Indians was accompanied by the\r\nsame acts of inhumanity as that which characterizes the traffic in\r\nAfrican negroes; it was attended also by the same result, that of\r\nrendering both the conquerors and the conquered more ferocious.\r\nThence wars became more frequent among the natives; prisoners were\r\ndragged from the inland countries to the coast, to be sold to the\r\nwhites, who Loaded them with chains in their ships. Yet the\r\nSpaniards were at that period, and long after, one of the most\r\npolished nations of Europe. The light which art and literature then\r\nshed over Italy, was reflected on every nation whose language\r\nemanated from the same source as that of Dante and Petrarch. It\r\nmight have been expected that a general improvement of manners\r\nwould be the natural consequence of this noble awakening of the\r\nmind, this sublime soaring of the imagination. But in distant\r\nregions, wherever the thirst of wealth has introduced the abuse of\r\npower, the nations of Europe, at every period of their history,\r\nhave displayed the same character. The illustrious era of Leo X was\r\nsignalized in the New World by acts of cruelty that seemed to\r\nbelong to the most barbarous ages. We are less surprised, however,\r\nat the horrible picture presented by the conquest of America when\r\nwe think of the acts that are still perpetrated on the western\r\ncoast of Africa, notwithstanding the benefits of a more humane\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\nThe principles adopted by Charles V had abolished the slave trade\r\non the New Continent. But the Conquistadores, by the continuation\r\nof their incursions, prolonged the system of petty warfare which\r\ndiminished the American population, perpetuated national\r\nanimosities, and during a long period crushed the seeds of rising\r\ncivilization. At length the missionaries, under the protection of\r\nthe secular arm, spoke words of peace. It was the privilege of\r\nreligion to console humanity for a part of the evils committed in\r\nits name; to plead the cause of the natives before kings, to resist\r\nthe violence of the commendatories, and to assemble wandering\r\ntribes into small communities called Missions.\r\n\r\nBut these institutions, useful at first in stopping the effusion of\r\nblood, and in laying the first basis of society, have become in\r\ntheir result hostile to its progress. The effects of this insulated\r\nsystem have been such that the Indians have remained in a state\r\nlittle different from that in which they existed whilst yet their\r\nscattered dwellings were not collected round the habitation of a\r\nmissionary. Their number has considerably augmented, but the sphere\r\nof their ideas is not enlarged. They have progressively lost that\r\nvigour of character and that natural vivacity which in every state\r\nof society are the noble fruits of independence. By subjecting to\r\ninvariable rules even the slightest actions of their domestic life,\r\nthey have been rendered stupid by the effort to render them\r\nobedient. Their subsistence is in general more certain, and their\r\nhabits more pacific, but subject to the constraint and the dull\r\nmonotony of the government of the Missions, they show by their\r\ngloomy and reserved looks that they have not sacrificed their\r\nliberty to their repose without regret.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of September, at five in the morning, we began our\r\njourney to the Missions of the Chayma Indians and the group of\r\nlofty mountains which traverse New Andalusia. On account of the\r\nextreme difficulties of the road, we had been advised to reduce our\r\nbaggage to a very small bulk. Two beasts of burden were sufficient\r\nto carry our provision, our instruments, and the paper necessary to\r\ndry our plants. One chest contained a sextant, a dipping-needle, an\r\napparatus to determine the magnetic variation, a few thermometers,\r\nand Saussure's hygrometer. The greatest changes in the pressure of\r\nthe air in these climates, on the coasts, amount only to 1 to 1.3\r\nof a line; and if at any given hour or place the height of the\r\nmercury be once marked, the variations which that height\r\nexperiences throughout the whole year, at every hour of the day or\r\nnight, may with some accuracy be determined.\r\n\r\nThe morning was deliciously cool. The road, or rather path, which\r\nleads to Cumanacoa, runs along the right bank of the Manzanares,\r\npassing by the hospital of the Capuchins, situated in a small wood\r\nof lignum-vitae and arborescent capparis.* (* These caper-trees are\r\ncalled in the country, by the names pachaca, olivo, and ajito: they\r\nare the Capparis tenuisiliqua, Jacq., C. ferruginea, C. emarginata,\r\nC. elliptica, C. reticulata, C. racemosa.) On leaving Cumana we\r\nenjoyed during the short duration of the twilight, from the top of\r\nthe hill of San Francisco, an extensive view over the sea, the\r\nplain covered with bera* and its golden flowers (* Palo sano,\r\nZygophyllum arboreum, Jacq. The flowers have the smell of vanilla.\r\nIt is cultivated in the gardens of the Havannah under the strange\r\nname of the dictanno real (royal dittany).), and the mountains of\r\nthe Brigantine. We were struck by the great proximity in which the\r\nCordillera appeared before the disk of the rising sun had reached\r\nthe horizon. The tint of the summits is of a deeper blue, their\r\noutline is more strongly marked, and their masses are more\r\ndetached, as long as the transparency of the air is undisturbed by\r\nthe vapours, which, after accumulating during the night in the\r\nvalleys, rise in proportion as the atmosphere acquires warmth.\r\n\r\nAt the hospital of the Divina Pastora the path turns to north-east,\r\nand stretches for two leagues over a soil without trees, and\r\nformerly levelled by the waters. We there found not only cactuses,\r\ntufts of cistus-leaved tribulus, and the beautiful purple\r\neuphorbia,* (* Euphorbia tithymaloides.) but also the avicennia,\r\nthe allionia, the sesuvium, the thalinum, and most of the\r\nportulaceous plants which grow on the banks of the gulf of Cariaco.\r\nThis geographical distribution of plants appears to designate the\r\nlimits of the ancient coast, and to prove that the hills along the\r\nsouthern side of which we were passing, formed heretofore a small\r\nisland, separated from the continent by an arm of the sea.\r\n\r\nAfter walking two hours, we arrived at the foot of the high chain\r\nof the interior mountains, which stretches from east to west; from\r\nthe Brigantine to the Cerro de San Lorenzo. There, new rocks\r\nappear, and with them another aspect of vegetation. Every object\r\nassumes a more majestic and picturesque character; the soil,\r\nwatered by springs, is furrowed in every direction; trees of\r\ngigantic height, covered with lianas, rise from the ravines; their\r\nbark, black and burnt by the double action of the light and the\r\noxygen of the atmosphere, contrasts with the fresh verdure of the\r\npothos and dracontium, the tough and shining leaves of which are\r\nsometimes several feet long. The parasite monocotyledons take\r\nbetween the tropics the place of the moss and lichens of our\r\nnorthern zone. As we advanced, the forms and grouping of the rocks\r\nreminded us of Switzerland and the Tyrol. The heliconia, costus,\r\nmaranta, and other plants of the family of the balisiers (Canna\r\nindica), which near the coasts vegetate only in damp and low\r\nplaces, flourish in the American Alps at considerable height. Thus,\r\nby a singular similitude, in the torrid zone, under the influence\r\nof an atmosphere continually loaded with vapours the mountain\r\nvegetation presents the same features as the vegetation of the\r\nmarshes in the north of Europe on soil moistened by melting snow.*\r\n(* Wahlenberg, de Vegetatione Helvetiae et summi Septentrionis\r\npages 47, 59.)\r\n\r\nBefore we leave the plains of Cumana, and the breccia, or\r\ncalcareous sandstone, which constitutes the soil of the seaside, we\r\nwill describe the different strata of which this very recent\r\nformation is composed, as we observed it on the back of the hills\r\nthat surround the castle of San Antonio.\r\n\r\nThis breccia, or calcareous sandstone, is a local and partial\r\nformation, peculiar to the peninsula of Araya, the coasts of\r\nCumana, and Caracas. We again found it at Cabo Blanco, to the west\r\nof the port of Guayra, where it contains, besides broken shells and\r\nmadrepores, fragments, often angular, of quartz and gneiss. This\r\ncircumstance assimilates the breccia to that recent sandstone\r\ncalled by the German mineralogists nagelfluhe, which covers so\r\ngreat a part of Switzerland to the height of a thousand toises,\r\nwithout presenting any trace of marine productions. Near Cumana the\r\nformation of the calcareous breccia contains:--first, a compact\r\nwhitish grey limestone, the strata of which, sometimes horizontal,\r\nsometimes irregularly inclined, are from five to six inches thick;\r\nsome beds are almost unmixed with petrifactions, but in the\r\ngreatest part the cardites, the turbinites, the ostracites, and\r\nshells of small dimension, are found so closely connected, that the\r\ncalcareous matter forms only a cement, by which the grains of\r\nquartz and the organized bodies are united: second, a calcareous\r\nsandstone, in which the grains of sand are much more frequent than\r\nthe petrified shells; other strata form a sandstone entirely free\r\nfrom organic fragments, yielding but a small effervescence with\r\nacids, and enclosing not lamellae of mica, but nodules of compact\r\nbrown iron-ore: third, beds of indurated clay containing selenite\r\nand lamellar gypsum.\r\n\r\nThe breccia, or agglomerate of the sea-coast, just described, has a\r\nwhite tint, and it lies immediately on the calcareous formation of\r\nCumanacoa, which is of a bluish grey. These two rocks form a\r\ncontrast no less striking than the molasse (bur-stone) of the Pays\r\nde Vaud, with the calcareous limestone of the Jura. It must be\r\nobserved, that, by contact of the two formations lying upon each\r\nother, the beds of the limestone of Cumanacoa, which I consider as\r\nan Alpine limestone, are always largely mixed with clay and marl.\r\nLying, like the mica-slate of Araya, north-east and south-west,\r\nthey are inclined, near Punta Delgada, under an angle of 60\r\ndegrees to south-east.\r\n\r\nWe traversed the forest by a narrow path, along a rivulet, which\r\nrolls foaming over a bed of rocks. We observed, that the vegetation\r\nwas more brilliant, wherever the Alpine limestone was covered by a\r\nquartzose sandstone without petrifactions, and very different from\r\nthe breccia of the sea-coast. The cause of this phenomenon depends\r\nprobably not so much on the nature of the ground, as on the greater\r\nhumidity of the soil. The quartzose sandstone contains thin strata\r\nof a blackish clay-slate,* (* Schieferthon.) which might easily be\r\nconfounded with the secondary thonschiefer; and these strata hinder\r\nthe water from filtering into the crevices, of which the Alpine\r\nlimestone is full. This last offers to view here, as in Saltzburg,\r\nand on the chain of the Apennines, broken and steep beds. The\r\nsandstone, on the contrary, wherever it is seated on the calcareous\r\nrock, renders the aspect of the scene less wild. The hills which it\r\nforms appear more rounded, and the gentler slopes are covered with\r\na thicker mould.\r\n\r\nIn humid places, where the sandstone envelopes the Alpine\r\nlimestone, some trace of cultivation is constantly found. We met\r\nwith huts inhabited by mestizoes in the ravine of Los Frailes, as\r\nwell as between the Cuesta de Caneyes, and the Rio Guriental. Each\r\nof these huts stands in the centre of an enclosure, containing\r\nplantains, papaw-trees, sugar-canes, and maize. We might be\r\nsurprised at the small extent of these cultivated spots, if we did\r\nnot recollect that an acre planted with plantains* (* Musa\r\nparadisiaca.) produces nearly twenty times as much food as the same\r\nspace sown with corn. In Europe, our wheat, barley, and rye cover\r\nvast spaces of ground; and in general the arable lands touch each\r\nother, wherever the inhabitants live upon corn. It is different\r\nunder the torrid zone, where man obtains food from plants which\r\nyield more abundant and earlier harvests. In those favoured climes,\r\nthe fertility of the soil is proportioned to the heat and humidity\r\nof the atmosphere. An immense population finds abundant nourishment\r\nwithin a narrow space, covered with plantains, cassava, yams, and\r\nmaize. The isolated situation of the huts dispersed through the\r\nforest indicates to the traveller the fecundity of nature, where a\r\nsmall spot of cultivated land suffices for the wants of several\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\nThese considerations on the agriculture of the torrid zone\r\ninvoluntarily remind us of the intimate connexion existing between\r\nthe extent of land cleared, and the progress of society. The\r\nrichness of the soil, and the vigour of organic life, by\r\nmultiplying the means of subsistence, retard the progress of\r\nnations in the paths of civilization. Under so mild and uniform a\r\nclimate, the only urgent want of man is that of food. This want\r\nonly, excites him to labour; and we may easily conceive why, in the\r\nmidst of abundance, beneath the shade of the plantain and\r\nbread-fruit tree, the intellectual faculties unfold themselves less\r\nrapidly than under a rigorous sky, in the region of corn, where our\r\nrace is engaged in a perpetual struggle with the elements. In\r\nEurope we estimate the number of the inhabitants of a country by\r\nthe extent of cultivation: within the tropics, on the contrary, in\r\nthe warmest and most humid parts of South America, very populous\r\nprovinces appear almost deserted; because man, to find nourishment,\r\ncultivates but a small number of acres. These circumstances modify\r\nthe physical appearance of the country and the character of its\r\ninhabitants, giving to both a peculiar physiognomy; the wild and\r\nuncultivated stamp which belongs to nature, ere its primitive type\r\nhas been altered by art. Without neighbours, almost unconnected\r\nwith the rest of mankind, each family of settlers forms a separate\r\ntribe. This insulated state arrests or retards the progress of\r\ncivilization, which advances only in proportion as society becomes\r\nnumerous, and its connexions more intimate and multiplied. But, on\r\nthe other hand, it is solitude that develops and strengthens in man\r\nthe sentiment of liberty and independence; and gives birth to that\r\nnoble pride of character which has at all times distinguished the\r\nCastilian race.\r\n\r\nFrom these causes, the land in the most populous regions of\r\nequinoctial America still retains a wild aspect, which is destroyed\r\nin temperate climates by the cultivation of corn. Within the\r\ntropics the agricultural nations occupy less ground: man has there\r\nless extended his empire; he may be said to appear, not as an\r\nabsolute master, who changes at will the surface of the soil, but\r\nas a transient guest, who quietly enjoys the gifts of nature.\r\nThere, in the neighbourhood of the most populous cities, the land\r\nremains studded with forests, or covered with a thick mould,\r\nunfurrowed by the plough. Spontaneous vegetation still predominates\r\nover cultivated plants, and determines the aspect of the landscape.\r\nIt is probable that this state of things will change very slowly.\r\nIf in our temperate regions the cultivation of corn contributes to\r\nthrow a dull uniformity upon the land we have cleared, we cannot\r\ndoubt, that, even with increasing population, the torrid zone will\r\npreserve that majesty of vegetable forms, those marks of an\r\nunsubdued, virgin nature, which render it so attractive and so\r\npicturesque. Thus it is that, by a remarkable concatenation of\r\nphysical and moral causes, the choice and production of alimentary\r\nplants have an influence on three important objects at once; the\r\nassociation or the isolated state of families, the more or less\r\nrapid progress of civilization, and the individual character of the\r\nlandscape.\r\n\r\nIn proportion as we penetrated into the forest, the barometer\r\nindicated the progressive elevation of the land. The trunks of the\r\ntrees presented here an extraordinary phenomenon; a gramineous\r\nplant, with verticillate branches,* climbs, like a liana, eight or\r\nten feet high, and forms festoons, which cross the path, and swing\r\nabout with the wind. (* Carice, analogous to the chusque of Santa\r\nFe, of the group of the Nastusas. This gramineous plant is\r\nexcellent pasture for mules.) We halted, about three o'clock in the\r\nafternoon, on a small flat, known by the name of Quetepe, and\r\nsituated about one hundred and ninety toises above the level of the\r\nsea. A few small houses have been erected near a spring, well known\r\nby the natives for its coolness and great salubrity. We found the\r\nwater delicious. Its temperature was only 22.5 degrees of the\r\ncentigrade thermometer, while that of the air was 28.7 degrees. The\r\nsprings which descend from the neighbouring mountains of a greater\r\nheight often indicate a too rapid decrement of heat. If indeed we\r\nsuppose the mean temperature of the water on the coast of Cumana\r\nequal to 26 degrees, we must conclude, unless other local causes\r\nmodify the temperature of the springs, that the spring of Quetepe\r\nacquires its great coolness at more than 350 toises of absolute\r\nelevation. With respect to the springs which gush out in the plains\r\nof the torrid zone, or at a small elevation, it may be observed, in\r\ngeneral, that it is only in regions where the mean temperature of\r\nsummer essentially differs from that of the whole year, that the\r\ninhabitants have extremely cold spring water during the season of\r\ngreat heat. The Laplanders, near Umea and Soersele, in the 65th\r\ndegree of latitude, drink spring-water, the temperature of which,\r\nin the month of August, is scarcely two or three degrees above\r\nfreezing point; while during the day the heat of the air rises in\r\nthe shade, in the same northern regions, to 26 or 27 degrees. In\r\nthe temperate climates of France and Germany, the difference\r\nbetween the air and the springs never exceeds 16 or 17 degrees;\r\nbetween the tropics it seldom rises to 5 or 6 degrees. It is easy\r\nto account for these phenomena, when we recollect that the interior\r\nof the globe, and the subterraneous waters, have a temperature\r\nalmost identical with the annual mean temperature of the air; and\r\nthat the latter differs from the mean heat of summer, in proportion\r\nto the distance from the equator.\r\n\r\nFrom the top of a hill of sandstone, which overlooks the spring of\r\nQuetepe, we had a magnificent view of the sea, of cape Macanao, and\r\nthe peninsula of Maniquarez. At our feet an immense forest extended\r\nto the edge of the ocean. The tops of the trees, intertwined with\r\nlianas, and crowned with long wreaths of flowers, formed a vast\r\ncarpet of verdure, the dark tint of which augmented the splendour\r\nof the aerial light. This picture struck us the more forcibly, as\r\nwe then first beheld those great masses of tropical vegetation. On\r\nthe hill of Quetepe, at the foot of the Malpighia cocollobaefolia,\r\nthe leaves of which are extremely coriaceous, we gathered, among\r\ntufts of the Polygala montana, the first melastomas, especially\r\nthat beautiful species described under the name of the Melastoma\r\nrufescens.\r\n\r\nAs we advanced toward the south-west, the soil became dry and\r\nsandy. We climbed a group of mountains, which separate the coast\r\nfrom the vast plains, or savannahs, bordered by the Orinoco. That\r\npart of the group, over which passes the road to Cumanacoa, is\r\ndestitute of vegetation, and has steep declivities both on the\r\nnorth and the south. It has received the name of the Imposible,\r\nbecause it is believed that, in the case of hostile invasion, this\r\nridge of mountains would be inaccessible to the enemy, and would\r\noffer an asylum to the inhabitants of Cumana. We reached the top a\r\nlittle before sunset, and I had scarcely time to take a few horary\r\nangles, to determine the longitude of the place by means of the\r\nchronometer.\r\n\r\nThe view from the Imposible is finer and more extensive than that\r\nfrom the table-land of Quetepe. We distinguished clearly by the\r\nnaked eye the flattened top of the Brigantine (the position of\r\nwhich it would be important to fix accurately), the embarcadero or\r\nlanding-place, and the roadstead of Cumana. The rocky coast of the\r\npeninsula of Araya was discernible in its whole length. We were\r\nparticularly struck with the extraordinary configuration of a port,\r\nknown by the name of Laguna Grande, or Laguna del Obispo. A vast\r\nbasin, surrounded by high mountains, communicates with the gulf of\r\nCariaco by a narrow channel which admits only of the passage of one\r\nship at a time. This port is capable of containing several\r\nsquadrons at once. It is an uninhabited place, but annually\r\nfrequented by vessels, which carry mules to the West India Islands.\r\nThere are some pasture grounds at the farther end of the bay. We\r\ntraced the sinuosities of this arm of the sea, which, like a river,\r\nhas dug a bed between perpendicular rocks destitute of vegetation.\r\nThis singular prospect reminded us of the fanciful landscape which\r\nLeonardo da Vinci has made the back-ground of his famous portrait\r\nof Mona Lisa, the wife of Francisco del Giacondo.\r\n\r\nWe could observe by the chronometer the moment when the disk of the\r\nsun touched the horizon of the sea. The first contact was at 6\r\nhours 8 minutes 13 seconds; the second, at 6 hours 10 minutes 26\r\nseconds; mean time. This observation, which is not unimportant for\r\nthe theory of terrestrial refractions, was made on the summit of\r\nthe mountain, at the absolute height of 296 toises. The setting of\r\nthe sun was attended by a very rapid cooling of the air. Three\r\nminutes after the last apparent contact of the disk with the\r\nhorizon of the sea, the thermometer suddenly fell from 25.2 to 21.3\r\ndegrees. Was this extraordinary refrigeration owing to some\r\ndescending current? The air was however calm, and no horizontal\r\nwind was felt.\r\n\r\nWe passed the night in a house where there was a military post\r\nconsisting of eight men, under the command of a Spanish serjeant.\r\nIt was an hospital, built by the side of a powder magazine. When\r\nCumana, after the capture of Trinidad by the English, in 1797, was\r\nthreatened with an attack, many of the inhabitants fled to\r\nCumanacoa, and deposited whatever articles of value they possessed\r\nin sheds hastily constructed on the top of the Imposible. It was\r\nthen resolved, in case of any unforeseen invasion, to abandon the\r\ncastle of San Antonio, after a short resistance, and to concentrate\r\nthe whole force of the province round the mountains, which may be\r\nconsidered as the key of the Llanos.\r\n\r\nThe top of the Imposible, as nearly as I could perceive, is covered\r\nwith a quartzose sandstone, free from petrifactions. Here, as on\r\nthe ridge of the neighbouring mountains, the strata pretty\r\nregularly take the direction from north-north-east to\r\nsouth-south-west. This direction is also most common in the\r\nprimitive formations in the peninsula of Araya, and along the\r\ncoasts of Venezuela. On the northern declivity of the Imposible,\r\nnear the Penas Negras, an abundant spring issues from sandstone,\r\nwhich alternates with a schistose clay. We remarked on this point\r\nfractured strata, which lie from north-west to south-east, and the\r\ndip of which is almost perpendicular.\r\n\r\nThe Llaneros, or inhabitants of the plains, send their produce,\r\nespecially maize, leather, and cattle, to the port of Cumana by the\r\nroad over the Imposible. We continually saw mules arrive, driven by\r\nIndians or mulattoes. Several parts of the vast forests which\r\nsurround the mountain, had taken fire. Reddish flames, half\r\nenveloped in clouds of smoke, presented a very grand spectacle. The\r\ninhabitants set fire to the forests, to improve the pasturage, and\r\nto destroy the shrubs that choke the grass. Enormous\r\nconflagrations, too, are often caused by the carelessness of the\r\nIndians, who neglect, when they travel, to extinguish the fires by\r\nwhich they have dressed their food. These accidents contribute to\r\ndiminish the number of old trees in the road from Cumana to\r\nCumanacoa; and the inhabitants observe justly, that, in several\r\nparts of their province, the dryness has increased, not only\r\nbecause every year the frequency of earthquakes causes more\r\ncrevices in the soil; but also because it is now less thickly\r\nwooded than it was at the time of the conquest.\r\n\r\nI arose during the night to determine the latitude of the place by\r\nthe passage of Fomalhaut over the meridian; but the observation was\r\nlost, owing to the time I employed in taking the level of the\r\nartificial horizon. It was midnight, and I was benumbed with cold,\r\nas were also our guides: yet the thermometer kept at 19.7 degrees.\r\nAt Cumana I have never seen it sink below 21 degrees; but then the\r\nhouse in which we dwelt on the Imposible was 258 toises above the\r\nlevel of the sea. At the Casa de la Polvora I determined the dip of\r\nthe magnetic needle, which was 42.5 degrees.* (* The magnetic dip\r\nis always measured in this work, according to the centesimal\r\ndivision, if the contrary be not expressly mentioned.) The number\r\nof oscillations correspondent to 10 minutes of time was 233. The\r\nintensity of the magnetic forces had consequently augmented from\r\nthe coast to the mountain, perhaps from the influence of some\r\nferruginous matter, hidden in the strata of sandstone which cover\r\nthe Alpine limestone.\r\n\r\nWe left the Imposible on the 5th of September before sunrise. The\r\ndescent is very dangerous for beasts of burden; the path being in\r\ngeneral but fifteen inches broad, and bordered by precipices. In\r\ndescending the mountain, we observed the rock of Alpine limestone\r\nreappearing under the sandstone. The strata being generally\r\ninclined to the south and south-east, a great number of springs\r\ngush out on the southern side of the mountain. In the rainy season\r\nof the year, these springs form torrents, which descend in\r\ncascades, shaded by the hura, the cuspa, and the silver-leaved\r\ncecropia or trumpet-tree.\r\n\r\nThe cuspa, a very common tree in the environs of Cumana and of\r\nBordones, is yet unknown to the botanists of Europe. It was long\r\nused only for the building of houses, and has become celebrated\r\nsince 1797, under the name of the cascarilla or bark-tree\r\n(cinchona) of New Andalusia. Its trunk rises scarcely above fifteen\r\nor twenty feet. Its alternate leaves are smooth, entire, and oval.*\r\n(* At the summit of the boughs, the leaves are sometimes opposite\r\nto each other, but invariably without stipules.) Its bark very\r\nthin, and of a pale yellow, is a powerful febrifuge. It is even\r\nmore bitter than the bark of the real cinchona, but is less\r\ndisagreeable. The cuspa is administered with the greatest success,\r\nin a spirituous tincture, and in aqueous infusion, both in\r\nintermittent and in malignant fevers.\r\n\r\nOn the coasts of New Andalusia, the cuspa is considered as a kind\r\nof cinchona; and we were assured, that some Aragonese monks, who\r\nhad long resided in the kingdom of New Grenada, recognised this\r\ntree from the resemblance of its leaves to those of the real\r\nPeruvian bark-tree. This, however, is unfounded; since it is\r\nprecisely by the disposition of the leaves, and the absence of\r\nstipules, that the cuspa differs totally from the trees of the\r\nrubiaceous family. It may be said to resemble the family of the\r\nhoneysuckle, or caprifoliaceous plants, one section of which has\r\nalternate leaves, and among which we find several cornel-trees,\r\nremarkable for their febrifuge properties.* (* Cornus florida, and\r\nC. sericea of the United States.--Walker on the Virtues of the\r\nCornus and the Cinchona compared. Philadelphia 1803.)\r\n\r\nThe taste, at once bitter and astringent, and the yellow colour of\r\nthe bark led to the discovery of the febrifugal virtue of the\r\ncuspa. As it blossoms at the end of November, we did not see it in\r\nflower, and we know not to what genus it belongs; and I have in\r\nvain for several years past applied to our friends at Cumana for\r\nspecimens of the flower and fruit. I hope that the botanical\r\ndetermination of the bark-tree of New Andalusia will one day fix\r\nthe attention of travellers, who visit this region after us; and\r\nthat they will not confound, notwithstanding the analogy of the\r\nnames, the cuspa with the cuspare. The latter not only vegetates in\r\nthe missions of the Rio Carony, but also to the west of Cumana, in\r\nthe gulf of Santa Fe. It furnishes the druggists of Europe with the\r\nfamous Cortex Angosturae, and forms the genus Bonplandia, described\r\nby M. Willdenouw in the Memoirs of the Academy of Berlin, from\r\nnotes communicated to him by us.\r\n\r\nIt is singular that, during our long abode on the coast of Cumana\r\nand the Caracas, on the banks of the Apure, the Orinoco, and the\r\nRio Negro, in an extent of country comprising forty thousand square\r\nleagues, we never met with one of those numerous species of\r\ncinchona, or exostema, which are peculiar to the low and warm\r\nregions of the tropics, especially to the archipelago of the West\r\nIndia Islands. Yet we are far from affirming, that, throughout the\r\nwhole of the eastern part of South America, from Porto Bello to\r\nCayenne, or from the equator to the 10th degree of north latitude\r\nbetween the meridians of 54 and 71 degrees, the cinchona absolutely\r\ndoes not exist. How can we be expected to know completely the flora\r\nof so vast an extent of country? But, when we recollect, that even\r\nin Mexico no species of the genera cinchona and exostema has been\r\ndiscovered, either in the central table-land or in the plains, we\r\nare led to believe, that the mountainous islands of the West Indies\r\nand the Cordillera of the Andes have peculiar floras; and that they\r\npossess particular species of vegetation, which have neither passed\r\nfrom the islands to the continent, nor from South America to the\r\ncoasts of New Spain.\r\n\r\nIt may be observed farther, that, when we reflect on the numerous\r\nanalogies which exist between the properties of plants and their\r\nexternal forms, we are surprised to find qualities eminently\r\nfebrifuge in the bark of trees belonging to different genera, and\r\neven different families.* (* It may be somewhat interesting to\r\nchemistry, physiology, and descriptive botany, to consider under\r\nthe same point of view the plants which have been employed in\r\nintermittent fevers with different degrees of success. We find\r\namong rubiaceous plants, besides the cinchonas and exostemas, the\r\nCoutarea speciosa or Cayenne bark, the Portlandia grandiflora of\r\nthe West Indies, another portlandia discovered by M. Sesse at\r\nMexico, the Pinkneia pubescens of the United States, the berry of\r\nthe coffee-tree, and perhaps the Macrocnemum corymbosum, and the\r\nGuettarda coccinea; among magnoliaceous plants, the tulip-tree and\r\nthe Magnolia glauca; among zanthoxylaceous plants, the Cuspare of\r\nAngostura, known in America under the name of Orinoco bark, and the\r\nZanthoxylon caribaeum; among leguminous plants, the geoffraeas, the\r\nSwietenia febrifuga, the Aeschynomene grandiflora, the Caesalpina\r\nbonducella; among caprifoliaceous plants, the Cornus florida and\r\nthe Cuspa of Cumana; among rosaceous plants, the Cerasus virginiana\r\nand the Geum urbanum; among amentaceous plants, the willows, oaks,\r\nand birch-trees, of which the alcoholic tincture is used in Russia\r\nby the common people; the Populus tremuloides, etc.; among\r\nanonaceous plants, the Uvaria febrifuga, the fruit of which we saw\r\nadministered with success in the Missions of Spanish Guiana; among\r\nsimarubaceous plants, the Quassia amara, celebrated in the feverish\r\nplains of Surinam; among terebinthaceous plants, the Rhus glabrum;\r\namong euphorbiaceous plants, the Croton cascarilla; among composite\r\nplants, the Eupatorium perfoliatum, the febrifuge qualities of\r\nwhich are known to the savages of North America. Of the tulip-tree\r\nand the quassia, it is the bark of the roots that is used. Eminent\r\nfebrifuge virtues have also been found in the cortical part of the\r\nroots of the Cinchona condaminea at Loxa; but it is fortunate, for\r\nthe preservation of the species, that the roots of the real\r\ncinchona are not employed in pharmacy. Chemical researches are yet\r\nwanting upon the very powerful bitters contained in the roots of\r\nthe Zanthoriza apiifolia, and the Actaea racemosa: the latter have\r\nsometimes been employed with success as a remedy against the\r\nepidemic yellow fever in New York.) Some of these barks so much\r\nresemble each other, that it is not easy to distinguish them at\r\nfirst sight. But before we examine the question, whether we shall\r\none day discover, in the real cinchona, in the cuspa of Cumana, the\r\nCortex Angosturae, the Indian swietenia, the willows of Europe, the\r\nberries of the coffee-tree and uvaria, a matter uniformly diffused,\r\nand exhibiting (like starch, caoutchouc, and camphor) the same\r\nchemical properties in different plants, we may ask whether, in the\r\npresent state of physiology and medicine, a febrifuge principle\r\nought to be admitted. Is it not probable, that the particular\r\nderangement in the organization, known under the vague name of the\r\nfebrile state, and in which both the vascular and the nervous\r\nsystems are at the same time attacked, yields to remedies which do\r\nnot operate by the same principle, by the same mode of action on\r\nthe same organs, by the same play of chemical and electrical\r\nattractions? We shall here confine ourselves to this observation,\r\nthat, in the species of the genus cinchona, the antifebrile virtues\r\ndo not appear to belong to the tannin (which is only accidentally\r\nmingled in them), or to the cinchonate of lime; but in a resiniform\r\nmatter, soluble both by alcohol and by water, and which, it is\r\nbelieved, is composed of two principles, the cinchonic bitter and\r\nthe cinchonic red.* (* In French, l'amer et le rouge cinchoniques.)\r\nMay it then be admitted, that this resiniform matter, which\r\npossesses different degrees of energy according to the combinations\r\nby which it is modified, is found in all febrifuge substances?\r\nThose by which the sulphate of iron is precipitated of a green\r\ncolour, like the real cinchona, the bark of the white willow, and\r\nthe horned perisperm of the coffee-tree, do not on this account\r\ndenote identity of chemical composition;* and that identity might\r\neven exist, without our concluding that the medical virtues were\r\nanalogous. (* The cuspare bark (Cort. Angosturae) yields with iron\r\na yellow precipitate; yet it is employed on the banks of the\r\nOrinoco, and particularly at the town of St. Thomas of Angostura,\r\nas an excellent cinchona; and on the other hand, the bark of the\r\ncommon cherry tree, which has scarcely any febrifuge quality,\r\nyields a green precipitate like the real cinchonas. Notwithstanding\r\nthe extreme imperfection of vegetable chemistry, the experiments\r\nalready made on cinchonas sufficiently show, that to judge of the\r\nfebrifuge virtues of a bark, we must not attach too much importance\r\neither to the principle which turns to green the oxides of iron, or\r\nto the tannin, or to the matter which precipitates infusions of\r\ntan.) We see that specimens of sugar and tannin extracted from\r\nplants, not of the same family, present numerous differences: while\r\nthe comparative analysis of sugar, gum, and starch; the discovery\r\nof the radical of the prussic acid (the effects of which are so\r\npowerful on the organization), and many other phenomena of\r\nvegetable chemistry, clearly prove that substances composed of\r\nidentical elements, few in number and proportional in quantity,\r\nexhibit the most heterogeneous properties, on account of that\r\nparticular mode of combination which corpuscular chemistry calls\r\nthe arrangement of the particles.\r\n\r\nLeaving the ravine which descends from the Imposible, we entered a\r\nthick forest traversed by many small rivers, which are easily\r\nforded. We observed that the cecropia, which in the disposition of\r\nits branches and its slender trunk, resembles the palm-tree, is\r\ncovered with leaves more or less silvery, in proportion as the soil\r\nis dry or moist. We saw some small plants of the cecropia, the\r\nleaves of which were on both sides entirely green.* (* Is not the\r\nCecropia concolor of Willdenouw a variety of the Cecropia peltata?)\r\nThe roots of these trees are hid under tufts of dorstenia, which\r\nflourishes only in humid and shady places. In the midst of the\r\nforest, on the banks of the Rio Cedeno, as well as on the southern\r\ndeclivity of the Cocollar, we find, in their wild state, papaw and\r\norange-trees, bearing large and sweet fruit. These are probably the\r\nremains of some conucos, or Indian plantations; for in those\r\ncountries the orange-tree cannot be counted among the indigenous\r\nplants, any more than the banana-tree, the papaw-tree, maize,\r\ncassava, and many other useful plants, with the true country of\r\nwhich we are unacquainted, though they have accompanied man in his\r\nmigrations from the remotest times.\r\n\r\nWhen a traveller newly arrived from Europe penetrates for the first\r\ntime into the forests of South America, he beholds nature under an\r\nunexpected aspect. He feels at every step, that he is not on the\r\nconfines but in the centre of the torrid zone; not in one of the\r\nWest India Islands, but on a vast continent where everything is\r\ngigantic,--mountains, rivers, and the mass of vegetation. If he\r\nfeel strongly the beauty of picturesque scenery he can scarcely\r\ndefine the various emotions which crowd upon his mind; he can\r\nscarcely distinguish what most excites his admiration, the deep\r\nsilence of those solitudes, the individual beauty and contrast of\r\nforms, or that vigour and freshness of vegetable life which\r\ncharacterize the climate of the tropics. It might be said that the\r\nearth, overloaded with plants, does not allow them space enough to\r\nunfold themselves. The trunks of the trees are everywhere concealed\r\nunder a thick carpet of verdure; and if we carefully transplanted\r\nthe orchideae, the pipers, and the pothoses, nourished by a single\r\ncourbaril, or American fig-tree,* (* Ficus nymphaeifolia.) we\r\nshould cover a vast extent of ground. By this singular assemblage,\r\nthe forests, as well as the flanks of the rocks and mountains,\r\nenlarge the domains of organic nature. The same lianas which creep\r\non the ground, reach the tops of the trees, and pass from one to\r\nanother at the height of more than a hundred feet. Thus, by the\r\ncontinual interlacing of parasite plants, the botanist is often led\r\nto confound one with another, the flowers, the fruits, and leaves,\r\nwhich belong to different species.\r\n\r\nWe walked for some hours under the shade of these arcades, which\r\nscarcely admit a glimpse of the sky; the latter appeared to me of\r\nan indigo blue, the deeper in shade because the green of the\r\nequinoctial plants is generally of a stronger hue, with somewhat of\r\na brownish tint. A great fern tree,* (* Possibly our Aspidium\r\ncaducum.) very different from the Polypodium arboreum of the West\r\nIndies, rose above masses of scattered rocks. In this place we were\r\nstruck for the first time with the sight of those nests in the\r\nshape of bottles, or small bags, which are suspended from the\r\nbranches of the lowest trees, and which attest the wonderful\r\nindustry of the orioles, which mingle their warbling with the\r\nhoarse cries of the parrots and the macaws. These last, so well\r\nknown for their vivid colours, fly only in pairs, while the real\r\nparrots wander about in flocks of several hundreds. A man must have\r\nlived in those regions, particularly in the hot valleys of the\r\nAndes, to conceive how these birds sometimes drown with their\r\nvoices the noise of the torrents, which dash down from rock to\r\nrock.\r\n\r\nWe left the forests, at the distance of somewhat more than a league\r\nfrom the village of San Fernando. A narrow path led, after many\r\nwindings, into an open but extremely humid country. In such a site\r\nin the temperate zone, the cyperaceous and gramineous plants would\r\nhave formed vast meadows; here the soil abounded in aquatic plants,\r\nwith sagittate leaves, and especially in basil plants, among which\r\nwe noticed the fine flowers of the costus, the thalia, and the\r\nheliconia. These succulent plants are from eight to ten feet high,\r\nand in Europe one of their groups would be considered as a little\r\nwood.\r\n\r\nNear San Fernando the evaporation caused by the action of the sun\r\nwas so great that, being very lightly clothed, we felt ourselves as\r\nwet as in a vapour bath. The road was bordered with a kind of\r\nbamboo,* (* Bambusa guadua.) which the Indians call iagua, or\r\nguadua, and which is more than forty feet in height. Nothing can\r\nexceed the elegance of this arborescent gramen. The form and\r\ndisposition of its leaves give it a character of lightness which\r\ncontrasts agreeably with its height. The smooth and glossy trunk of\r\nthe iagua generally bends towards the banks of rivulets, and it\r\nwaves with the slightest breath of air. The highest reeds* in the\r\nsouth of Europe (* Arundo donax.), can give no idea of the aspect\r\nof the arborescent gramina. The bamboo and fern-tree are, of all\r\nthe vegetable forms between the tropics, those which make the most\r\npowerful impression on the imagination of the traveller. Bamboos\r\nare less common in South America than is usually believed. They are\r\nalmost wanting in the marshes and in the vast inundated plains of\r\nthe Lower Orinoco, the Apure, and the Atabapo, while they form\r\nthick woods, several leagues in length, in the north-west, in New\r\nGrenada, and in the kingdom of Quito. It might be said that the\r\nwestern declivity of the Andes is their true country; and, what is\r\nremarkable enough, we found them not only in the low regions at the\r\nlevel of the ocean, but also in the lofty valleys of the\r\nCordilleras, at the height of 860 toises.\r\n\r\nThe road skirted with the bamboos above mentioned led us to the\r\nsmall village of San Fernando, situated in a narrow plain,\r\nsurrounded by very steep calcareous rocks. This was the first\r\nMission* we saw in America. (* A certain number of habitations\r\ncollected round a church, with a missionary monk performing the\r\nministerial duties, is called in the Spanish colonies Mision, or\r\nPueblo de mision. Indian villages, governed by a priest, are called\r\nPueblos de doctrina. A distinction is made between the Cura\r\ndoctrinero, who is the priest of an Indian parish, and the Cura\r\nrector, priest of a village inhabited by whites and men of mixed\r\nrace.) The houses, or rather the huts of the Chayma Indians, though\r\nseparate from each other, are not surrounded by gardens. The\r\nstreets, which are wide and very straight, cross each other at\r\nright angles. The walls of the huts are made of clay, strengthened\r\nby lianas. The uniformity of these huts, the grave and taciturn air\r\nof their inhabitants, and the extreme neatness of the dwellings,\r\nreminded us of the establishments of the Moravian Brethren. Besides\r\ntheir own gardens, every Indian family helps to cultivate the\r\ngarden of the community, or, as it is called, the conuco de la\r\ncomunidad, which is situated at some distance from the village. In\r\nthis conuco the adults of each sex work one hour in the morning and\r\none in the evening. In the missions nearest the coast the garden of\r\nthe community is generally a sugar or indigo plantation, under the\r\ndirection of the missionary; and its produce, if the law were\r\nstrictly observed, could be employed only for the support of the\r\nchurch and the purchase of sacerdotal ornaments. The great square\r\nof San Fernando, in the centre of the village, contains the church,\r\nthe dwelling of the missionary, and a very humble-looking edifice\r\npompously called the king's house (Casa del Rey). This is a\r\ncaravanserai, destined for lodging travellers; and, as we often\r\nexperienced, infinitely valuable in a country where the name of an\r\ninn is still unknown. The Casas del Rey are to be found in all the\r\nSpanish colonies, and may be deemed an imitation of the tambos of\r\nPeru, which were established in conformity with the laws of Manco\r\nCapac.\r\n\r\nWe had been recommended to the friars who govern the Missions of\r\nthe Chayma Indians, by their syndic, who resides at Cumana. This\r\nrecommendation was the more useful to us, as the missionaries,\r\neither from zeal for the purity of the morals of their\r\nparishioners, or to conceal the monastic system from the indiscreet\r\ncuriosity of strangers, often adhere with rigour to an old\r\nregulation, by which a white man of the secular state is not\r\npermitted to sojourn more than one night in an Indian village. The\r\nMissions form (I will not say according to their primitive and\r\ncanonical institutions, but in reality) a distinct and nearly\r\nindependent hierarchy, the views of which seldom accord with those\r\nof the secular clergy.\r\n\r\nThe missionary of San Fernando was a Capuchin, a native of Aragon,\r\nfar advanced in years, but strong and healthy. His extreme\r\ncorpulency, his hilarity, the interest he took in battles and\r\nsieges, ill accorded with the ideas we form in northern countries\r\nof the melancholy reveries and the contemplative life of\r\nmissionaries. Though extremely busy about a cow which was to be\r\nkilled next day, the old monk received us with kindness, and\r\npermitted us to hang up our hammocks in a gallery of his house.\r\nSeated, without doing anything, the greater part of the day, in an\r\narmchair of red wood, he bitterly complained of what he called the\r\nindolence and ignorance of his countrymen. Our missionary, however,\r\nseemed well satisfied with his situation.\r\n\r\nHe treated the Indians with mildness; he beheld his Mission\r\nprosper, and he praised with enthusiasm the waters, the bananas,\r\nand the dairy-produce of the district. The sight of our\r\ninstruments, our books, and our dried plants, drew from him a\r\nsarcastic smile; and he acknowledged, with the naivete peculiar to\r\nthe inhabitants of those countries, that of all the enjoyments of\r\nlife, without excepting sleep, none was comparable to the pleasure\r\nof eating good beef (carne de vaca): thus does sensuality obtain an\r\nascendancy, where there is no occupation for the mind.\r\n\r\nThe mission of San Fernando was founded about the end of the 17th\r\ncentury, near the junction of the small rivers of the Manzanares\r\nand Lucasperez. A fire, which consumed the church and the huts of\r\nthe Indians, induced the Capuchins to build the village in its\r\npresent fine situation. The number of families is increased to one\r\nhundred, and the missionary observed to us, that the custom of\r\nmarrying at thirteen or fourteen years of age contributes greatly\r\nto this rapid increase of population. He denied that old age was so\r\npremature among the Chaymas, as is commonly believed in Europe. The\r\ngovernment of these Indian parishes is very complicated; they have\r\ntheir governor, their major-alguazils, and their\r\nmilitia-commanders, all copper-coloured natives. The company of\r\narchers have their colours, and perform their exercise with the bow\r\nand arrow, in shooting at a mark; this is the national guard\r\n(militia) of the country. This military establishment, under a\r\npurely monastic system, seemed to us very singular.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 5th of September, and the following morning,\r\nthere was a thick fog; yet we were not more than a hundred toises\r\nabove the level of the sea. I determined geometrically, at the\r\nmoment of our departure, the height of the great calcareous\r\nmountain which rises at 800 toises distance to the south of San\r\nFernando, and forms a perpendicular cliff on the north side. It is\r\nonly 215 toises higher than the great square; but naked masses of\r\nrock, which here exhibit themselves in the midst of a thick\r\nvegetation, give it a very majestic aspect.\r\n\r\nThe road from San Fernando to Cumana passes amidst small\r\nplantations, through an open and humid valley. We forded a number\r\nof rivulets. In the shade the thermometer did not rise above 30\r\ndegrees: but we were exposed to the direct rays of the sun, because\r\nthe bamboos, which skirted the road, afforded but small shelter,\r\nand we suffered greatly from the heat. We passed through the\r\nvillage of Arenas, inhabited by Indians, of the same race as those\r\nat San Fernando. But Arenas is no longer a mission; and the\r\nnatives, governed by a regular priest,* (* The four villages of\r\nArenas, Macarapana, Mariguitar, and Aricagua, founded by Aragonese\r\nCapuchins, are called Doctrinas de Encomienda.) are better clothed,\r\nand more civilized. Their church is also distinguished in the\r\ncountry by some rude paintings which adorn its walls. A narrow\r\nborder encloses figures of armadilloes, caymans, jaguars, and other\r\nanimals peculiar to the new world.\r\n\r\nIn this village lives a labourer, Francisco Lozano, who presented a\r\nhighly curious physiological phenomenon. This man has suckled a\r\nchild with his own milk. The mother having fallen sick, the father,\r\nto quiet the infant, took it into his bed, and pressed it to his\r\nbosom. Lozano, then thirty-two years of age, had never before\r\nremarked that he had milk: but the irritation of the nipple, sucked\r\nby the child, caused the accumulation of that liquid. The milk was\r\nthick and very sweet. The father, astonished at the increased size\r\nof his breast, suckled his child two or three times a day during\r\nfive months. He drew on himself the attention of his neighbours,\r\nbut he never thought, as he probably would have done in Europe, of\r\nderiving any advantage from the curiosity he excited. We saw the\r\ncertificate, which had been drawn up on the spot, to attest this\r\nremarkable fact, eye-witnesses of which are still living. They\r\nassured us that, during this suckling, the child had no other\r\nnourishment than the milk of his father. Lozano, who was not at\r\nArenas during our journey in the missions, came to us at Cumana. He\r\nwas accompanied by his son, then thirteen or fourteen years of age.\r\nM. Bonpland examined with attention the father's breasts, and found\r\nthem wrinkled like those of a woman who has given suck. He observed\r\nthat the left breast in particular was much enlarged; which Lozano\r\nexplained to us from the circumstance, that the two breasts did not\r\nfurnish milk in the same abundance. Don Vicente Emparan, governor\r\nof the province, sent a circumstantial account of this phenomenon\r\nto Cadiz.\r\n\r\nIt is not a very uncommon circumstance, to find, among animals,\r\nmales whose breasts contain milk; and climate does not appear to\r\nexercise any marked influence on the greater or less abundance of\r\nthis secretion. The ancients cite the milk of the he-goats of\r\nLemnos and Corsica. In our own time, we have seen in Hanover, a\r\nhe-goat, which for a great number of years was milked every other\r\nday, and yielded more milk than a female goat. Among the signs of\r\nthe alleged weakness of the Americans, travellers have mentioned\r\nthe milk contained in the breasts of men. It is, however,\r\nimprobable, that it has ever been observed in a whole tribe, in\r\nsome part of America unknown to modern travellers; and I can affirm\r\nthat at present it is not more common in the new continent, than in\r\nthe old. The labourer of Arenas, whose case has just been\r\nmentioned, was not of the copper-coloured race of Chayma Indians,\r\nbut was a white man, descended from Europeans. Moreover, the\r\nanatomists of St. Petersburgh have observed that, among the lower\r\norders of the people in Russia, milk in the breasts of men is much\r\nmore frequent than among the more southern nations: yet the\r\nRussians have never been deemed weak and effeminate. There is among\r\nthe varieties of the human species a race of men whose breasts at\r\nthe age of puberty acquire a considerable bulk. Lozano did not\r\nbelong to that race; and he often repeated to us his conviction,\r\nthat it was only the irritation of the nipple, in consequence of\r\nthe suction, which caused the flow of milk.\r\n\r\nWhen we reflect on the whole of the vital phenomena, we find that\r\nno one of them is entirely isolated. In every age examples are\r\ncited of very young girls and women in extreme old age, who have\r\nsuckled children. Among men these examples are more rare; and after\r\nnumerous researches, I have not found above two or three. One is\r\ncited by the anatomist of Verona, Alexander Benedictus, who lived\r\nabout the end of the fifteenth century. He relates the history of\r\nan inhabitant of Syria, who, to calm the fretfulness of his child,\r\nafter the death of the mother, pressed it to his bosom. The milk\r\nsoon became so abundant, that the father could take on himself the\r\nnourishment of his child without assistance. Other examples are\r\nrelated by Santorellus, Faria, and Robert, bishop of Cork. The\r\ngreater part of these phenomena having been noticed in times very\r\nremote, it is not uninteresting to physiology, that we can confirm\r\nthem in our own days.\r\n\r\nOn approaching the town of Cumanacoa we found a more level soil,\r\nand a valley enlarging itself progressively. This small town is\r\nsituated in a naked plain, almost circular, and surrounded by lofty\r\nmountains. It was founded in 1717 by Domingo Arias, on the return\r\nof an expedition to the mouth of the Guarapiche, undertaken with\r\nthe view of destroying an establishment which some French\r\nfreebooters had attempted to found. The new town was first called\r\nSan Baltazar de las Arias; but the Indian name Cumanacoa prevailed;\r\nin like manner the name of Santiago de Leon, still to be found in\r\nour maps, is forgotten in that of Caracas.\r\n\r\nOn opening the barometer we were struck at seeing the column of\r\nmercury scarcely 7.3 lines shorter than on the coasts. The plain,\r\nor rather the table-land, on which the town of Cumanacoa is\r\nsituated, is not more than 104 toises above the level of the sea,\r\nwhich is three or four times less than is supposed by the\r\ninhabitants of Cumana, on account of their exaggerated ideas of the\r\ncold of Cumanacoa. But the difference of climate observable between\r\nplaces so near each other is perhaps less owing to comparative\r\nheight than to local circumstances. Among these causes we may cite\r\nthe proximity of the forests; the frequency of descending currents,\r\nso common in these valleys, closed on every side; the abundance of\r\nrain; and those thick fogs which diminish during a great part of\r\nthe year the direct action of the solar rays. The decrement of the\r\nheat being nearly the same within the tropics, and during the\r\nsummer under the temperate zone, the small difference of level of\r\none hundred toises should produce only a change in the mean\r\ntemperature of 1 or 1.5 degrees. But we shall soon find that at\r\nCumanacoa the difference rises to more than four degrees. This\r\ncoolness of the climate is sometimes the more surprising, as very\r\ngreat heat is felt at Carthago (in the province of Popayan); at\r\nTomependa, on the bank of the river Amazon, and in the valleys of\r\nAragua, to the west of Caracas; though the absolute height of these\r\ndifferent places is between 200 and 480 toises. In plains as well\r\nas on mountains the isothermal lines (lines of similar heat) are\r\nnot constantly parallel to the equator, or the surface of the\r\nglobe. It is the grand problem of meteorology to determine the\r\ninflections of these lines, and to discover, amid modifications\r\nproduced by local causes, the constant laws of the distribution of\r\nheat.\r\n\r\nThe port of Cumana is only seven nautical leagues from Cumanacoa.\r\nIt scarcely ever rains in the first-mentioned place, while in the\r\nlatter there are seven months of wintry weather. At Cumanacoa, the\r\ndry season begins at the winter solstice, and lasts till the vernal\r\nequinox. Light showers are frequent in the months of April, May,\r\nand June. The dry weather then returns again, and lasts from the\r\nsummer solstice to the end of August. Then come the real winter\r\nrains, which cease only in the month of November, and during which\r\ntorrents of water pour down from the skies.\r\n\r\nIt was during the winter season that we took up our first abode in\r\nthe Missions. Every night a thick fog covered the sky, and it was\r\nonly at intervals that I succeeded in taking some observations of\r\nthe stars. The thermometer kept from 18.5 to 20 degrees, which\r\nunder this zone, and to the sensations of a traveller coming from\r\nthe coasts, appears a great degree of coolness. I never perceived\r\nthe temperature in the night at Cumana below 21 degrees. The\r\ngreatest heat is felt from noon to 3 o'clock, the thermometer\r\nkeeping between 26 and 27 degrees. The maximum of the heat, about\r\ntwo hours after the passage of the sun over the meridian, was very\r\nregularly marked by a storm which murmured near. Large black and\r\nlow clouds dissolved in rain, which came down in torrents: these\r\nrains lasted two or three hours, and lowered the thermometer five\r\nor six degrees. About five o'clock the rain entirely ceased, the\r\nsun reappeared a little before it set, and the hygrometer moved\r\ntowards the point of dryness; but at eight or nine we were again\r\nenveloped in a thick stratum of vapour. These different changes\r\nfollow successively, we were assured, during whole months, and yet\r\nnot a breath of wind is felt. Comparative experiments led us to\r\nbelieve that in general the nights at Cumanacoa are from two to\r\nthree, and the days from four to five centesimal degrees cooler\r\nthan at the port of Cumana. These differences are great; and if,\r\ninstead of meteorological instruments, we consulted only our own\r\nfeelings, we should suppose they were still more considerable.\r\n\r\nThe vegetation of the plain which surrounds the town is monotonous,\r\nbut, owing to the extreme humidity of the air, remarkable for its\r\nfreshness. It is chiefly characterized by an arborescent solanum,\r\nforty feet in height, the Urtica baccifera, and a new species of\r\nthe genus Guettarda.* (* These trees are surrounded by Galega\r\npilosa, Stellaria rotundifolia, Aegiphila elata of Swartz,\r\nSauvagesia erecta, Martinia perennis, and a great number of\r\nRivinas. We find among the gramineous plants, in the savannah of\r\nCumanacoa, the Paspalus lenticularis, Panicum ascendens, Pennisetum\r\nuniflorum, Gynerium saccharoides, Eleusine indica, etc.) The ground\r\nis very fertile, and might be easily watered if trenches were cut\r\nfrom a great number of rivulets, the springs of which never dry up\r\nduring the whole year. The most valuable production of the district\r\nis tobacco. Since the introduction of the farm* (* Estanco real de\r\ntabaco, royal monopoly of tobacco.) in 1779, the cultivation of\r\ntobacco in the province of Cumana is nearly confined to the valley\r\nof Cumanacoa; as in Mexico it is permitted only in the two\r\ndistricts of Orizaba and Cordova. The farm system is a monopoly\r\nodious to the people. All the tobacco that is gathered must be sold\r\nto government; and to prevent, or rather to diminish fraud, it has\r\nbeen found most easy to concentrate the cultivation in one point.\r\nGuards scour the country, to destroy any plantations without the\r\nboundaries of the privileged districts; and to inform against those\r\ninhabitants who smoke cigars prepared by their own hands.\r\n\r\nNext to the tobacco of the island of Cuba and of the Rio Negro,\r\nthat of Cumana is the most aromatic. It excels all the tobacco of\r\nNew Spain and of the province of Varinas. We shall give some\r\nparticulars of its culture, which essentially differs from the\r\nmethod practised in Virginia. The prodigious expansion which is\r\nremarked in the solaneous plants of the valley of Cumanacoa,\r\nespecially in the abundant species of the Solanum arborescens, of\r\naquartia, and of cestrum, seems to indicate the favourable nature\r\nof this spot for plantations of tobacco. The seed is sown in the\r\nopen ground, at the beginning of September; though sometimes not\r\ntill the month of December, which period is however less favourable\r\nfor the harvest. The cotyledons appear on the eighth day, and the\r\nyoung plants are covered with large leaves of heliconia and\r\nplantain, and shelter them from the direct action of the sun. Great\r\ncare also is taken to destroy weeds, which, between the tropics,\r\nspring up with astonishing rapidity. The tobacco is transplanted\r\ninto a rich and well-prepared soil, a month or two after it has\r\nrisen from the seed. The plants are disposed in regular rows, three\r\nor four feet distant from each other. Care is taken to weed them\r\noften, and the principal stalk is several times topped, till\r\ngreenish blue spots indicate to the cultivator the maturity of the\r\nleaves. They begin to gather them in the fourth month, and this\r\nfirst gathering generally terminates in the space of a few days. It\r\nwould be better if the leaves were plucked only as they dry. In\r\ngood years the cultivators cut the plant when it is only four feet\r\nhigh; and the shoot which springs from the root, throws out new\r\nleaves with such rapidity that they may be gathered on the\r\nthirteenth or fourteenth day. These last have the cellular tissue\r\nvery much extended, and they contain more water, more albumen and\r\nless of that acrid, volatile principle, which is but little soluble\r\nin water, and in which the stimulant property of tobacco seems to\r\nreside.\r\n\r\nAt Cumanacoa the tobacco, after being gathered, undergoes a\r\npreparation which the Spaniards call cura seca. The leaves are\r\nsuspended by threads of cocuiza;* (* Agave Americana.) their ribs\r\nare taken out, and they are twisted into cords. The prepared\r\ntobacco should be carried to the king's warehouses in the month of\r\nJune; but the indolence of the inhabitants, and the preference they\r\ngive to the cultivation of maize and cassava, usually prevent them\r\nfrom finishing the preparation before the month of August. It is\r\neasy to conceive that the leaves, so long exposed to very moist\r\nair, must lose some of their flavour. The administrator of the farm\r\nkeeps the tobacco deposited in the king's warehouses sixty days\r\nwithout touching it. When this time is expired, the manoques are\r\nopened to examine the quality. If the administrator find the\r\ntobacco well prepared, he pays the cultivator three piastres for\r\nthe aroba of twenty-five pounds weight. The same quantity is resold\r\nfor the king's profit at twelve piastres and a half. The tobacco\r\nthat is rotten (podrido), that is, again gone into a state of\r\nfermentation, is publicly burnt; and the cultivator, who has\r\nreceived money in advance from the royal farm, loses irrevocably\r\nthe fruits of his long labour. We saw heaps, amounting to five\r\nhundred arobas, burnt in the great square, which in Europe might\r\nhave served for making snuff.\r\n\r\nThe soil of Cumanacoa is so favourable to this branch of culture,\r\nthat tobacco grows wild, wherever the seed finds any moisture. It\r\ngrows thus spontaneously at Cerro del Cuchivano, and around the\r\ncavern of Caripe. The only kind of tobacco cultivated at Cumanacoa,\r\nas well as in the neighbouring districts of Aricagua and San\r\nLorenzo, is that with large sessile leaves,* (* Nicotiana tabacum.)\r\ncalled Virginia tobacco. The tobacco with petiolate leaves,* (*\r\nNicotiana rustica.) which is the yetl of the ancient Mexicans, is\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\nIn studying the history of our cultivated plants, we are surprised\r\nto find that, before the conquest, the use of tobacco was spread\r\nthrough the greater part of America, while the potato was unknown\r\nboth in Mexico and the West India Islands, where it grows well in\r\nthe mountainous regions. Tobacco has also been cultivated in\r\nPortugal since the year 1559, though the potato did not become an\r\nobject of European agriculture till the end of the seventeenth and\r\nbeginning of the eighteenth century. This latter plant, which has\r\nhad so powerful an influence on the well-being of society, has\r\nspread in both continents more slowly than tobacco, which can be\r\nconsidered only as an article of luxury.\r\n\r\nNext to tobacco, the most important culture of the valley of\r\nCumanacoa is that of indigo. The manufacturers of Cumanacoa, of San\r\nFernando, and of Arenas, produce indigo of greater commercial value\r\nthan that of Caracas; and often nearly equalling in splendour and\r\nrichness of colour the indigo of Guatimala. It was from that\r\nprovince that the coasts of Cumana received the first seeds of the\r\nIndigofera anil,* which is cultivated jointly with the Indigofera\r\ntinctoria. (* The indigo known in commerce is produced by four\r\nspecies of plants; the Indigofera tinctoria, I. anil, I. argentea,\r\nand I. disperma. At the Rio Negro, near the frontiers of Brazil, we\r\nfound the I. argentea growing wild, but only in places anciently\r\ninhabited by Indians.) The rains being very frequent in the valley\r\nof Cumanacoa, a plant of four feet high yields no more colouring\r\nmatter than one of a third part that size in the arid valleys of\r\nAragua, to the west of the town of Caracas.\r\n\r\nThe manufactories we examined are all built on uniform principles.\r\nTwo steeping vessels, or vats, which receive the plants intended to\r\nbe brought into a state of fermentation, are joined together. Each\r\nvat is fifteen feet square, and two and a half deep. From these\r\nupper vats the liquor runs into beaters, between which is placed\r\nthe water-mill. The axletree of the great wheel crosses the two\r\nbeaters. It is furnished with ladles, fixed to long handles,\r\nadapted for the beating. From a spacious settling-vat, the\r\ncolouring fecula is carried to the drying place, and spread on\r\nplanks of brasiletto, which, having small wheels, can be sheltered\r\nunder a roof in case of sudden rains. Sloping and very low roofs\r\ngive the drying place the appearance of hot-houses at some\r\ndistance. In the valley of Cumanacoa, the fermentation of the plant\r\nis produced with astonishing rapidity. It lasts in general but four\r\nor five hours. This short duration can be attributed only to the\r\nhumidity of the climate, and the absence of the sun during the\r\ndevelopment of the plant. I think I have observed, in the course of\r\nmy travels, that the drier the climate, the slower the vat works,\r\nand the greater the quantity of indigo, at the minimum of\r\noxidation, contained in the stalks. In the province of Caracas,\r\nwhere 562 cubic feet of the plant slightly piled up yield\r\nthirty-five or forty pounds of dry indigo, the liquid does not pass\r\ninto the beater till after twenty, thirty, or thirty-five hours. It\r\nis probable that the inhabitants of Cumanacoa would extract more\r\ncolouring matter if they left the plants longer steeping in the\r\nfirst vat.* (* The planters are pretty generally of opinion, that\r\nthe fermentation should never continue less than ten hours.\r\nBeauvais-Raseau, Art de l'Indigotier page 81.) During my abode at\r\nCumana I made solutions of the indigo of Cumanacoa, which is\r\nsomewhat heavy and coppery, and that of Caracas, in sulphuric acid,\r\nin order to compare them, and the solution of the former appeared\r\nto me to be of a much more intense blue.\r\n\r\nThe plain of Cumanacoa, spotted with farms and small plantations of\r\nindigo and tobacco, is surrounded with mountains, which towards the\r\nsouth rise to considerable height. Everything indicates that the\r\nvalley is the bottom of an ancient lake. The mountains, which in\r\nancient times formed its shores, all rise perpendicularly in the\r\ndirection of the plain. The only outlet for the waters of the lake\r\nwas on the side of Arenas. In digging foundations, beds of round\r\npebbles, mixed with small bivalve shells, are found; and according\r\nto the report of persons worthy of credit, there were discovered,\r\nthirty years ago, at the bottom of the ravine of San Juanillo, two\r\nenormous femoral bones, four feet long, and weighing more than\r\nthirty pounds. The Indians imagined that these were giants' bones;\r\nwhilst the half-learned sages of the country, who assume the right\r\nof explaining everything, gravely asserted that they were mere\r\nsports of nature, and little worthy of attention; an opinion\r\nfounded on the circumstance that human bones decay rapidly in the\r\nsoil of Cumanacoa. In order to decorate their churches on the\r\nfestival of the dead, they take skulls from the cemeteries on the\r\ncoast, where the earth is impregnated with saline substances. These\r\npretended thigh-bones of giants were carried to the port of Cumana,\r\nwhere I sought for them in vain; but from the analogy of some\r\nfossil bones which I brought from other parts of South America, and\r\nwhich have been carefully examined by M. Cuvier, it is probable\r\nthat the gigantic femoral bones of Cumanacoa belonged to elephants\r\nof a species now extinct. It may appear surprising that they were\r\nfound in a place so little elevated above the present level of the\r\nwaters; since it is a remarkable fact, that the fragments of the\r\nmastodons and fossil elephants which I brought from the equinoctial\r\nregions of Mexico, New Grenada, Quito, and Peru, were not found in\r\nlow regions (as were the megatherium of Rio Luxan* (* One league\r\nsouth-east from the town of Buenos Ayres.) and Virginia,* (* The\r\nmegatherium of Virginia is the megalonyx of Mr. Jefferson. All the\r\nenormous remains found in the plains of the new continent, either\r\nnorth or south of the equator, belong, not to the torrid, but to\r\nthe temperate zone. On the other hand, Pallas observes that in\r\nSiberia, consequently also northward of the tropics, fossil bones\r\nare never found in mountainous parts. These facts, intimately\r\nconnected together, seem calculated to lead to the discovery of a\r\ngreat geological law.) the great mastodons of the Ohio, and the\r\nfossil elephants of the Susquehanna, in the temperate zone), but on\r\ntable-lands having from six to fourteen hundred toises of\r\nelevation.\r\n\r\nAs we approached the southern bank of the basin of Cumanacoa, we\r\nenjoyed the view of the Turimiquiri.* (* Some of the inhabitants\r\npronounce this name Tumuriquiri, others Turumiquiri, or\r\nTumiriquiri. During the whole time of our stay at Cumanacoa, the\r\nsummit of this mountain was covered with clouds. It appeared\r\nuncovered on the evening of the 11th of September, but only for a\r\nfew minutes. The angle of elevation, taken from the great square of\r\nCumanacoa, was 8 degrees 2 minutes. This determination, and the\r\nbarometrical measurement which I made on the 13th, may enable us to\r\nfix, within a certain approximation, the distance of the mountain\r\nat six miles and a third, or 6050 toises; admitting that the part\r\nuncovered by clouds was 850 toises above the plain of Cumanacoa.)\r\nAn enormous wall of rocks, the remains of an ancient cliff, rises\r\nin the midst of the forests. Farther to the west, at Cerro del\r\nCuchivano, the chain of mountains seems as if broken by the effects\r\nof an earthquake. The crevice is more than a hundred and fifty\r\ntoises wide, is surrounded by perpendicular rocks, and is filled\r\nwith trees, the interwoven branches of which find no room to\r\nspread. This cleft appears like a mine opened by the falling in of\r\nthe earth. It is intersected by a torrent, the Rio Juagua, and its\r\nappearance is highly picturesque. It is called Risco del Cuchivano.\r\nThe river rises at the distance of seven leagues south-west, at the\r\nfoot of the mountain of the Brigantine, and it forms some beautiful\r\ncascades before it spreads through the plain of Cumanacoa.\r\n\r\nWe visited several times a small farm, the Conuco of Bermudez,\r\nopposite the Risco del Cuchivano, where tobacco, plantains, and\r\nseveral species of cotton-trees,* are cultivated in the moist soil\r\n(* Gossypium uniglandulosum, improperly called herbaceum, and G.\r\nbarbadense.); especially that tree, the cotton of which is of a\r\nnankeen colour, and which is so common in the island of Margareta.*\r\n(* G. religiosum.) The proprietor of the farm told us that the\r\nRisco or crevice was inhabited by jaguar tigers. These animals pass\r\nthe day in caverns, and roam around human habitations at night.\r\nBeing well fed, they grow to the length of six feet. One of them\r\nhad devoured, in the preceding year, a horse belonging to the farm.\r\nHe dragged his prey on a fine moonlight night, across the savannah,\r\nto the foot of a ceiba* of an enormous size. (* Bombax ceiba:\r\nfive-leaved silk-cotton tree.) The groans of the dying horse awoke\r\nthe slaves of the farm, who went out armed with lances and\r\nmachetes.* (* Great knives, with very long blades, like a couteau\r\nde chasse. No one enters the woods in the torrid zone without being\r\narmed with a machete, not only to cut his way through the woods,\r\nbut as a defence against wild beasts.) The tiger, crouching over\r\nhis prey, awaited their approach with tranquillity, and fell only\r\nafter a long and obstinate resistance. This fact, and many others\r\nverified on the spot, prove that the great jaguar* of Terra Firma\r\n(* Felis onca, Linn., which Buffon called panthere oillee, and\r\nwhich he believed came from Africa.), like the jaguarete of\r\nParaguay, and the real tiger of Asia, does not flee from man when\r\nit is dared to close combat, and when not intimidated by the number\r\nof its assailants. Naturalists at present admit that Buffon was\r\nentirely mistaken with respect to the greatest of the feline race\r\nof America. What Buffon says of the cowardice of tigers of the new\r\ncontinent, relates to the small ocelots.* (* Felis pardalis, Linn.,\r\nor the chibiguazu of Azara, different from the Tlateo-Ocelotl, or\r\ntiger-cat of the Aztecs.) At the Orinoco, the real jaguar of\r\nAmerica sometimes leaps into the water, to attack the Indians in\r\ntheir canoes.\r\n\r\nOpposite the farm of Bermudez, two spacious caverns open into the\r\ncrevice of Cuchivano, whence at times there issue flames, which may\r\nbe seen at a great distance in the night; and, judging by the\r\nelevation of the rocks, above which these fiery exhalations ascend,\r\nwe should be led to think that they rise several hundred feet. This\r\nphenomenon was accompanied by a subterranean, dull, and long\r\ncontinued noise, at the time of the last great earthquake of\r\nCumana. It is observed chiefly during the rainy season; and the\r\nowners of the farms opposite the mountain of Cuchivano allege that\r\nthe flames have become more frequent since December 1797.\r\n\r\nIn a herborizing excursion we made at Rinconada we attempted to\r\npenetrate into the crevice, wishing to examine the rocks which\r\nseemed to contain in their bosom the cause of these extraordinary\r\nconflagrations; but the strength of the vegetation, the\r\ninterweaving of the lianas, and thorny plants, hindered our\r\nprogress. Happily the inhabitants of the valley themselves felt a\r\nwarm interest in our researches, less from the fear of a volcanic\r\nexplosion, than because their minds were impressed with the idea\r\nthat the Risco del Cuchivano contained a gold mine; and although we\r\nexpressed our doubts of the existence of gold in a secondary\r\nlimestone, they insisted on knowing \"what the German miner thought\r\nof the richness of the vein.\" Ever since the time of Charles V and\r\nthe government of the Welsers, the Alfingers, and the Sailers, at\r\nCoro and Caracas, the people of Terra Firma have entertained a\r\ngreat confidence in the Germans with respect to all that relates to\r\nthe working of mines. Wherever I went in South America, when the\r\nplace of my birth was known, I was shown samples of ore. In these\r\ncolonies every Frenchman is supposed to be a physician, and every\r\nGerman a miner.\r\n\r\nThe farmers, with the aid of their slaves, opened a path across the\r\nwoods to the first fall of the Rio Juagua; and on the 10th of\r\nSeptember we made our excursion to the Cuchivano. On entering the\r\ncrevice we recognised the proximity of tigers by a porcupine\r\nrecently emboweled. For greater security the Indians returned to\r\nthe farm, and brought back some dogs of a very small breed. We were\r\nassured that in the event of our meeting a jaguar in a narrow path\r\nhe would spring on the dog rather than on a man. We did not proceed\r\nalong the brink of the torrent, but on the slope of the rocks which\r\noverhung the water. We walked on the side of a precipice from two\r\nto three hundred feet deep, on a kind of very narrow cornice, like\r\nthe road which leads from the Grindelwald along the Mettenberg to\r\nthe great glacier. When the cornice was so narrow that we could\r\nfind no place for our feet, we descended into the torrent, crossed\r\nit by fording, and then climbed the opposite wall. These descents\r\nare very fatiguing, and it is not safe to trust to the lianas,\r\nwhich hang like great cords from the tops of the trees. The\r\ncreeping and parasite plants cling but feebly to the branches which\r\nthey embrace; the united weight of their stalks is considerable,\r\nand you run the risk of pulling down a whole mass of verdure, if,\r\nin walking on a sloping ground, you support your weight by the\r\nlianas. The farther we advanced the thicker the vegetation became.\r\nIn several places the roots of the trees had burst the calcareous\r\nrock, by inserting themselves into the clefts that separate the\r\nbeds. We had some trouble to carry the plants which we gathered at\r\nevery step. The cannas, the heliconias with fine purple flowers,\r\nthe costuses, and other plants of the amomum family, here attain\r\neight or ten feet in height, and their fresh tender verdure, their\r\nsilky gloss, and the extraordinary development of the parenchyma,\r\nform a striking contrast with the brown colour of the arborescent\r\nferns, the foliage of which is delicately shaped. The Indians made\r\nincisions with their large knives in the trunks of the trees, and\r\nfixed our attention on those beautiful red and gold-coloured woods,\r\nwhich will one day be sought for by our turners and cabinet-makers.\r\nThey showed us a plant of the compositae order, twenty feet high\r\n(the Eupatorium laevigatum of Lamarck), the rose of Belveria,* (*\r\nBrownea racemosa.) celebrated for the brilliancy of its purple\r\nflowers, and the dragon's-blood of this country, which is a kind of\r\ncroton not yet described.* (* Plants of families entirely different\r\nare called in the Spanish colonies of both continents, sangre de\r\ndraco; they are dracaenas, pterocarpi, and crotons. Father Caulin\r\nDescrip. Corografica page 25, in speaking of resins found in the\r\nforests of Cumana, makes a just distinction between the Draco de la\r\nSierra de Unare, which has pinnate leaves (Pterocarpus Draco), and\r\nthe Draco de la Sierra de Paria, with entire and hairy leaves. The\r\nlatter is the Croton sanguifluum of Cumanacoa, Caripe, and Cariaco.\r\n) The red and astringent juice of this plant is employed to\r\nstrengthen the gums. The Indians recognize the species by the\r\nsmell, and more particularly by chewing the woody fibres. Two\r\nnatives, to whom the same wood was given to chew, pronounced\r\nwithout hesitation the same name. We could avail ourselves but\r\nlittle of the sagacity of our guides, for how could we procure\r\nleaves, flowers, and fruits growing on trunks, the branches of\r\nwhich commence at fifty or sixty feet high? We were struck at\r\nfinding in this hollow the bark of trees, and even the soil,\r\ncovered with moss* and lichens. (* Real musci frondosi. We also\r\nfound, besides a small Boletus stipitatus, of a snow-white colour,\r\nthe Boletus igniarius, and the Lycoperdon stellatum of Europe. I\r\nhad found this last only in very dry places in Germany and Poland.)\r\nThe cryptogamous plants are here as common as in northern\r\ncountries. Their growth is favoured by the moisture of the air, and\r\nthe absence of the direct rays of the sun. Nevertheless the\r\ntemperature is generally at 25 degrees in the day, and 19 degrees\r\nat night.\r\n\r\nThe rocks which bound the crevice of Cuchivano are perpendicular\r\nlike walls, and are of the same calcareous formation which we\r\nobserved the whole way from Punta Delgada. It is here a blackish\r\ngrey, of compact fracture, tending sometimes towards the sandy\r\nfracture, and crossed by small veins of white carbonated lime. In\r\nthese characteristic marks we thought we discovered the alpine\r\nlimestone of Switzerland and the Tyrol, of which the colour is\r\nalways deep, though in a less degree than that of the transition\r\nlimestone.* (* Escher, in the Alpina volume 4 page 340.) The first\r\nof these formations constitutes the Cuchivano, the nucleus of the\r\nImposible, and in general the whole group of the mountains of New\r\nAndalusia. I saw no petrifactions in it; but the inhabitants assert\r\nthat considerable masses of shells are found at great heights. The\r\nsame phenomenon occurs in the country about Salzburg.* (* In\r\nSwitzerland, the solitary beds of shells, at the height of from\r\n1300 to 2000 toises (in the Jungfrauhorn, the Dent de Morcle, and\r\nthe Dent du Midi), belong to transition limestone.) At the\r\nCuchivano the alpine limestone contains beds of marly clay,*\r\n(*Mergelschiefer.) three or four toises thick; and this geological\r\nfact proves on the one hand the identity of the alpenkalkstein with\r\nthe zechstein of Thuringia, and on the other the affinity of\r\nformation existing between the alpine limestone and that of the\r\nJura.* (* The Jura and the Alpine limestone are kindred formations,\r\nand they are sometimes difficult to be distinguished, where they\r\nlie immediately one upon another, as in the Apennines. The alpine\r\nlimestone and the zechstein, famous among the geologists of\r\nFreyberg, are identical formations. This identity, which I noticed\r\nin the year 1793 (Uber die Grubenwetter), is a geological fact the\r\nmore interesting, as it seems to unite the northern European\r\nformations to those of the central chain. It is known that the\r\nzechstein is situated between the muriatiferous gypsum and the\r\nconglomerate (ancient sandstone); or where there is no\r\nmuriatiferous gypsum, between the slaty sandstone with roestones\r\n(buntesandstein, Wern.), and the conglomerate or ancient sandstone.\r\nIt contains strata of schistous and coppery marl (bituminoce mergel\r\nand kupferschiefer) which form an important object in the working\r\nof mines at Mansfeld in Saxony, near Riegelsdorf in Hesse, and at\r\nHasel and Prausnitz, in Silesia. In the southern part of Bavaria\r\n(Oberbaiern), I saw the alpine limestone, containing these same\r\nstrata of schistous clay and marl, which, though thinner, whiter,\r\nand especially more frequent, characterize the limestone of Jura.\r\nRespecting the slates of Blattenberg, in the canton of Glaris which\r\nsome mineralogists, because of their numerous impressions of fish,\r\nhave long mistaken for the cupreous slates of Mansfeld, they\r\nbelong, according to M. von Buch, to a real transition formation.\r\nAll these geological data tend to prove that strata of marl, more\r\nor less mixed with carbon, are to be found in the limestone of\r\nJura, in the alpine limestone, and in the transition schists. The\r\nmixture of carbon, sulphuretted iron, and copper, appears to me to\r\naugment with the relative antiquity of the formations.) The strata\r\nof marl effervesce with acids, though silex and alumina predominate\r\nin them: they are strongly impregnated with carbon, and sometimes\r\nblacken the hands, like a real vitriolic schistus. The supposed\r\ngold mine of Cuchivano, which was the object of our examination, is\r\nnothing but an excavation cut into one of those black strata of\r\nmarl, which contain pyrites in abundance. The excavation is on the\r\nright bank of the river Juagua, and must be approached with\r\ncaution, because the torrent there is more than eight feet deep.\r\nThe sulphurous pyrites are found, some massive, and others\r\ncrystallized and disseminated in the rock; their colour, of a very\r\nclear golden yellow, does not indicate that they contain copper.\r\nThey are mixed with fibrous sulphuret of iron,* (* Haarkies.) and\r\nnodules of swinestone, or fetid carbonate of lime. The marly\r\nstratum crosses the torrent; and, as the water washes out metallic\r\ngrains, the people imagine, on account of the brilliancy of the\r\npyrites, that the torrent bears down gold. It is reported that,\r\nafter the great earthquake which took place in 1766, the waters of\r\nthe Juagua were so charged with gold that \"men who came from a\r\ngreat distance, and whose country was unknown,\" established\r\nwashing-places on the spot. They disappeared during the night,\r\nafter having collected a great quantity of gold. It would be\r\nneedless to show that this is a fable. Pyrites dispersed in\r\nquartzose veins, crossing the mica-slate, are often auriferous, no\r\ndoubt; but no analogous fact leads to the supposition that the\r\nsulphuretted iron which is found in the schistose marls of the\r\nalpine limestone, contains gold. Some direct experiments, made with\r\nacids, during my abode at Caracas, showed that the pyrites of\r\nCuchivano are not auriferous. Our guides were amazed at my\r\nincredulity. In vain I repeated that alum and sulphate of iron only\r\ncould be obtained from this supposed gold mine; they continued\r\npicking up secretly every bit of pyrites they saw sparkling in the\r\nwater. In countries possessing few mines, the inhabitants entertain\r\nexaggerated ideas respecting the facility with which riches are\r\ndrawn from the bowels of the earth. How much time did we not lose\r\nduring five years' travels, in visiting, on the pressing\r\ninvitations of our hosts, ravines, of which the pyritous strata\r\nhave borne for ages the imposing names of 'Minas de oro!' How often\r\nhave we been grieved to see men of all classes, magistrates,\r\npastors of villages, grave missionaries, grinding, with\r\ninexhaustible patience, amphibole, or yellow mica, in the hope of\r\nextracting gold from it by means of mercury! This rage for the\r\nsearch of mines strikes us the more in a climate where the ground\r\nneeds only to be slightly raked to produce abundant harvests.\r\n\r\nAfter visiting the pyritous marls of the Rio Juagua, we continued\r\nfollowing the course of the crevice, which stretches along like a\r\nnarrow canal overshadowed by very lofty trees. We observed strata\r\non the left bank, opposite Cerro del Cuchivano, singularly crooked\r\nand twisted. This phenomenon I had often admired at the Ochsenberg,\r\n* in passing the lake of Lucerne. (* This mountain of Switzerland\r\nis composed of transition limestone. We find these same inflexions\r\nin the strata near Bonneville, at Nante d'Arpenas in Savoy, and in\r\nthe valley of Estaubee in the Pyrenees. Another transition rock,\r\nthe grauwakke of the Germans (very near the English killas),\r\nexhibits the same phenomenon in Scotland.) The calcareous beds of\r\nthe Cuchivano and the neighbouring mountains keep pretty regularly\r\nthe direction of north-north-east and south-south-west. Their\r\ninclination is sometimes north and sometimes south; most commonly\r\nthey seem to take a direction towards the valley of Cumanacoa; and\r\nit cannot be doubted that the valley has an influence* on the\r\ninclination of the strata. (* The same observation may apply to the\r\nlake of Gemunden in Styria, which I visited with M. von Buch, and\r\nwhich is one of the most picturesque situations in Europe.)\r\n\r\nWe had suffered great fatigue, and were quite drenched by\r\nfrequently crossing the torrent, when we reached the caverns of the\r\nCuchivano. A wall of rock there rises perpendicularly to the height\r\nof eight hundred toises. It is seldom that in a zone where the\r\nforce of vegetation everywhere conceals the soil and the rocks, we\r\nbehold a great mountain presenting naked strata in a perpendicular\r\nsection. In the middle of this section, and in a position\r\nunfortunately inaccessible to man, two caverns open in the form of\r\ncrevices. We were assured that they are inhabited by nocturnal\r\nbirds, the same as those we were soon to become acquainted with in\r\nthe Cueva del Guacharo of Caripe. Near these caverns we saw strata\r\nof schistose marl, and found, with great astonishment,\r\nrock-crystals encased in beds of alpine limestone. They were\r\nhexahedral prisms, terminated with pyramids, fourteen lines long\r\nand eight thick. The crystals, perfectly transparent, were\r\nsolitary, and often three or four toises distant from each other.\r\nThey were enclosed in the calcareous mass, as the quartz crystals\r\nof Burgtonna,* (* In the duchy of Gotha.) and the boracite of\r\nLunebourg, are contained in gypsum. There was no crevice near, or\r\nany vestige of calcareous spar.* (* This phenomenon reminds us of\r\nanother equally rare, the quartz crystals found by M. Freiesleben\r\nin Saxony, near Burgorner, in the county of Mansfeld, in the middle\r\nof a rock of porous limestone (rauchwakke), lying immediately on\r\nthe alpine limestone. The rock crystals, which are pretty common in\r\nthe primitive limestone of Carrara, line the insides of cavities in\r\nthe rocks, without being enveloped by the rock itself.)\r\n\r\nWe reposed at the foot of the cavern whence those flames were seen\r\nto issue, which of late years have become more frequent. Our guides\r\nand the farmer, an intelligent man, equally acquainted with the\r\nlocalities of the province, discussed, in the manner of the\r\nCreoles, the dangers to which the town of Cumanacoa would be\r\nexposed if the Cuchivano became an active volcano, or, as they\r\nexpressed it, \"se veniesse a reventar.\" It appeared to them\r\nevident, that since the great earthquakes of Quito and Cumana in\r\n1797, New Andalusia was every day more and more undermined by\r\nsubterranean fires. They cited the flames which had been seen to\r\nissue from the earth at Cumana; and the shocks felt in places where\r\nheretofore the ground had never been shaken. They recollected that\r\nat Macarapan, sulphurous emanations had been frequently perceived\r\nfor some months past. We were struck with these facts, upon which\r\nwere founded predictions that have since been almost all realized.\r\nEnormous convulsions of the earth took place at Caracas in 1812,\r\nand proved how tumultuously nature is agitated in the north-east\r\npart of Terra Firma.\r\n\r\nBut what is the cause of the luminous phenomena which are observed\r\nin the Cuchivano? The column of air which rises from the mouth of a\r\nburning volcano* is sometimes observed to shine with a splendid\r\nlight. (* We must not confound this very rare phenomenon with the\r\nglimmering commonly observed a few toises above the brink of a\r\ncrater, and which (as I remarked at Mount Vesuvius in 1805) is only\r\nthe reflection of great masses of inflamed scoria, thrown up\r\nwithout sufficient force to pass the mouth of the volcano.) This\r\nlight, which is believed to be owing to the hydrogen gas, was\r\nobserved from Chillo, on the summit of the Cotopaxi, at a time when\r\nthe mountain seemed in the greatest repose. According to the\r\nstatements of the ancients, the Mons Albanus, near Rome, known at\r\npresent under the name of Monte Cavo, appeared at times on fire\r\nduring the night; but the Mons Albanus is a volcano recently\r\nextinguished, which, in the time of Cato, threw out rapilli;* (*\r\n\"Albano monte biduum continenter lapidibus pluit.\"--Livy lib. 25\r\ncap. 7. (Heyne, Opuscula Acad. tome 3 page 261.)) while the\r\nCuchivano is a calcareous mountain, remote from any trap formation.\r\nCan these flames be attributed to the decomposition of water,\r\nentering into contact with the pyrites dispersed through the\r\nschistose marl? or is it inflamed hydrogen that issues from the\r\ncavern of Cuchivano? The marls, as the smell indicates, are\r\npyritous and bituminous at the same time; and the petroleum springs\r\nat the Buen Pastor, and in the island of Trinidad, proceed probably\r\nfrom these same beds of alpine limestone. It would be easy to\r\nsuppose some connexion between the waters filtering through this\r\ncalcareous stone, and decomposed by pyrites and the earthquakes of\r\nCumana, the springs of sulphuretted hydrogen in New Barcelona, the\r\nbeds of native sulphur at Carupano, and the emanations of\r\nsulphurous acid which are perceived at times in the savannahs. It\r\ncannot be doubted also, that the decomposition of water by the\r\npyrites at an elevated temperature, favoured by the affinity of\r\noxidated iron for earthy substances, may have caused that\r\ndisengagement of hydrogen gas, to the action of which several\r\nmodern geologists have attributed so much importance. But in\r\ngeneral, sulphurous acid is perceived more commonly than hydrogen\r\nin the eruption of volcanoes, and the odour of that acid\r\nprincipally prevails while the earth is agitated by violent shocks.\r\nWhen we take a general view of the phenomena of volcanoes and\r\nearthquakes, when we recollect the enormous distance at which the\r\ncommotion is propagated below the basin of the sea, we readily\r\ndiscard explanations founded on small strata of pyrites and\r\nbituminous marls. I am of opinion that the shocks so frequently\r\nfelt in the province of Cumana are as little to be attributed to\r\nthe rocks above the surface of the earth, as those which agitate\r\nthe Apennines are assignable to asphaltic veins or springs of\r\nburning petroleum. The whole of these phenomena depend on more\r\ngeneral, I would almost say on deeper, causes; and it is not in the\r\nsecondary strata which form the exterior crust of our globe, but in\r\nthe primitive rocks, at an enormous distance from the soil, that we\r\nshould seek the focus of volcanic action. The greater progress we\r\nmake in geology, the more we feel the insufficiency of theories\r\nfounded on observations merely local.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of September we continued our journey to the convent of\r\nCaripe, the principal settlement of the Chayma missions. We chose,\r\ninstead of the direct road, that by the mountains of the\r\nCocollar* (* Is this name of Indian origin? At Cumana I heard\r\nit derived in a manner somewhat far-fetched from the Spanish word\r\ncogollo, signifying the heart of oleraceous plants. The Cocollar\r\nforms the centre of the whole group of the mountains of New\r\nAndalusia.) and the Turimiquiri, the height of which little exceeds\r\nthat of Jura. The road first runs eastward, crossing over the length\r\nof three leagues the table-land of Cumanacoa, in a soil formerly\r\nlevelled by the waters: it then turns to the south. We passed the\r\nlittle Indian village of Aricagua surrounded by woody hills. Thence\r\nwe began to ascend, and the ascent lasted more than four hours. We\r\ncrossed two-and-twenty times the river of Pututucuar, a rapid\r\ntorrent, full of blocks of calcareous rock. When, on the Cuesta del\r\nCocollar, we reached an elevation two thousand feet above the level\r\nof the sea, we were surprised to find scarcely any forests or great\r\ntrees. We passed over an immense plain covered with gramineous\r\nplants. Mimosas with hemispheric tops, and stems only four or five\r\nfeet high, alone vary the dull uniformity of the savannahs. Their\r\nbranches are bent towards the ground or spread out like umbrellas.\r\nWherever there are deep declivities, or masses of rocks half\r\ncovered with mould, the clusia or cupey, with great nymphaea\r\nflowers, displays its beautiful verdure. The roots of this tree are\r\neight inches in diameter, and they sometimes shoot out from the\r\ntrunk at the height of fifteen feet above the soil.\r\n\r\nAfter having climbed the mountain for a considerable time, we\r\nreached a small plain at the Hato del Cocollar. This is a solitary\r\nfarm, situated on a table-land 408 toises high. We rested three\r\ndays in this retreat, where we were treated with great kindness by\r\nthe proprietor, Don Mathias Yturburi, a native of Biscay, who had\r\naccompanied us from the port of Cumana. We there found milk,\r\nexcellent meat from the richness of the pasture, and above all, a\r\ndelightful climate. During the day the centigrade thermometer did\r\nnot rise above 22 or 23 degrees; a little before sunset it fell to\r\n19, and at night it scarcely kept up to 14 degrees.* (* 11.2\r\ndegrees Reaum.) The nightly temperature was consequently seven\r\ndegrees colder than that of the coasts, which is a fresh proof of\r\nan extremely rapid decrement of heat, the table-land of Cocollar\r\nbeing less elevated than the site of the town of Caracas.\r\n\r\nAs far as the eye could reach, we perceived, from this elevated\r\npoint, only naked savannahs. Small tufts of scattered trees rise in\r\nthe ravines; and notwithstanding the apparent uniformity of\r\nvegetation, great numbers of curious plants* are found here. (*\r\nCassia acuta, Andromeda rigida, Casearia hypericifolia, Myrtus\r\nlongifolia, Buettneria salicifolia, Glycine picta, G. pratensis, G.\r\ngibba, Oxalis umbrosa, Malpighia caripensis, Cephaelis salicifolia,\r\nStylosanthes angustifolia, Salvia pseudococcinea, Eryngium\r\nfoetidum. We found a second time this last plant, but at a\r\nconsiderable height, in the great forests of bark trees surrounding\r\nthe town of Loxa, in the centre of the Cordilleras.) We shall only\r\nspeak of a superb lobelia* with purple flowers (* Lobelia\r\nspectabilis.); the Brownea coccinea, which is upwards of a hundred\r\nfeet high; and above all; the pejoa, celebrated in the country on\r\naccount of the delightful and aromatic perfume emitted by its\r\nleaves when rubbed between the fingers.* (* It is the Gualtheria\r\nodorata. The pejoa is found round the lake of Cocollar, which gives\r\nbirth to the great river Guarapiche. We met with the same shrub at\r\nthe Cuchilla de Guanaguana. It is a subalpine plant, which forms at\r\nthe Silla de Caracas a zone much higher than in the province of\r\nCumana. The leaves of the pejoa have even a more agreeable smell\r\nthan those of the Myrtus pimenta, but they yield no perfume when\r\nrubbed a few hours after their separation from the tree.) But the\r\ngreat charms of this solitary place were the beauty and serenity of\r\nthe nights. The proprietor of the farm, who spent his evenings with\r\nus, seemed to enjoy the astonishment produced on Europeans newly\r\ntransplanted to the tropics, by that vernal freshness of the air\r\nwhich is felt on the mountains after sunset. In those distant\r\nregions, where men yet feel the full value of the gifts of nature,\r\na land-holder boasts of the water of his spring, the absence of\r\nnoxious insects, the salutary breeze that blows round his hill, as\r\nwe in Europe descant on the conveniences of our dwellings, and the\r\npicturesque effect of our plantations.\r\n\r\nOur host had visited the new world with an expedition which was to\r\nform establishments for felling wood for the Spanish navy on the\r\nshores of the gulf of Paria. In the vast forests of mahogany,\r\ncedar, and brazil-wood, which border the Caribbean Sea, it was\r\nproposed to select the trunks of the largest trees, giving them in\r\na rough way the shape adapted to the building of ships, and sending\r\nthem every year to the dockyard near Cadiz. White men, unaccustomed\r\nto the climate, could not support the fatigue of labour, the heat,\r\nand the effect of the noxious air exhaled by the forests. The same\r\nwinds which are loaded with the perfume of flowers, leaves, and\r\nwoods, infuse also, as we may say, the germs of dissolution into\r\nthe vital organs. Destructive fevers carried off not only the\r\nship-carpenters, but the persons who had the management of the\r\nestablishment; and this bay, which the early Spaniards named Golfo\r\nTriste (Melancholy Bay), on account of the gloomy and wild aspect\r\nof its coasts, became the grave of European seamen. Our host had\r\nthe rare good fortune to escape these dangers. After having\r\nwitnessed the death of a great number of his friends, he withdrew\r\nfrom the coast to the mountains of Cocollar.\r\n\r\nNothing can be compared to the majestic tranquillity which the\r\naspect of the firmament presents in this solitary region. When\r\ntracing with the eye, at night-fall, the meadows which bounded the\r\nhorizon,--the plain covered with verdure and gently undulated, we\r\nthought we beheld from afar, as in the deserts of the Orinoco, the\r\nsurface of the ocean supporting the starry vault of Heaven. The\r\ntree under which we were seated, the luminous insects flying in the\r\nair, the constellations which shone in the south; every object\r\nseemed to tell us how far we were from our native land. If amidst\r\nthis exotic nature we heard from the depth of the valley the\r\ntinkling of a bell, or the lowing of herds, the remembrance of our\r\ncountry was awakened suddenly. The sounds were like distant voices\r\nresounding from beyond the ocean, and with magical power\r\ntransporting us from one hemisphere to the other. Strange mobility\r\nof the imagination of man, eternal source of our enjoyments and our\r\npains!\r\n\r\nWe began in the cool of the morning to climb the Turimiquiri. This\r\nis the name given to the summit of the Cocollar, which, with the\r\nBrigantine, forms one single mass of mountain, formerly called by\r\nthe natives the Sierra de los Tageres. We travelled along a part of\r\nthe road on horses, which roam about these savannahs; but some of\r\nthem are used to the saddle. Though their appearance is very heavy,\r\nthey pass lightly over the most slippery turf. We first stopped at\r\na spring issuing, not from the calcareous rock, but from a layer of\r\nquartzose sandstone. The temperature was 21 degrees, consequently\r\n1.5 degrees less than the spring of Quetepe; and the difference of\r\nthe level is nearly 220 toises. Wherever the sandstone appears\r\nabove ground the soil is level, and constitutes as it were small\r\nplatforms, succeeding each other like steps. To the height of 700\r\ntoises, and even beyond, this mountain, like those in its vicinity,\r\nis covered only with gramineous plants.* (* The most abundant\r\nspecies are the paspalus; the Andropogon fastigiatum, which forms\r\nthe genus Diectomis of M. Palissot de Beauvais; and the Panicum\r\nolyroides.) The absence of trees is attributed at Cumana to the\r\ngreat elevation of the ground; but a slight reflection on the\r\ndistribution of plants in the Cordilleras of the torrid zone will\r\nlead us to conceive that the summits of New Andalusia are very far\r\nfrom reaching the superior limit of the trees, which in this\r\nlatitude is at least 1800 toises of absolute height. The smooth\r\nturf of the Cocollar begins to appear at 350 toises above the level\r\nof the sea, and the traveller may contrive to walk upon this turf\r\ntill he reaches a thousand toises in height. Farther on, beyond\r\nthis band covered with gramineous plants, we found, amidst peaks\r\nalmost inaccessible to man, a small forest of cedrela, javillo,* (*\r\nHuras crepitans, of the family of the euphorbias. The growth of its\r\ntrunk is so enormous, that M. Bonpland measured vats of javillo\r\nwood, 14 feet long and 8 wide. These vats, made from one log of\r\nwood, are employed to keep the guarapo, or juice of the sugar-cane,\r\nand the molasses. The seeds of javillo are a very active poison,\r\nand the milk that issues from the petioles, when broken, frequently\r\nproduced inflammation in our eyes, if by chance the least quantity\r\npenetrated under the eyelids.) and mahogany. These local\r\ncircumstances induce me to think that the mountainous savannahs of\r\nthe Cocollar and Turimiquiri owe their existence only to the\r\ndestructive custom practised by the natives of setting fire to the\r\nwoods when they want to convert the soil into pasturage. Where,\r\nduring the lapse of three centuries, grasses and alpine plants have\r\ncovered the soil with a thick carpet, the seeds of trees can no\r\nlonger germinate and fix themselves in the earth, though birds and\r\nwinds convey them continually from the distant forests into the\r\nsavannahs.\r\n\r\nThe climate of these mountains is so mild that at the farm of the\r\nCocollar the cotton and coffee tree, and even the sugar cane, are\r\ncultivated with success. Whatever the inhabitants of the coasts may\r\nallege, hoar-frost has never been found in the latitude of 10\r\ndegrees, on heights scarcely exceeding those of the Mont d'Or, or\r\nthe Puy-de-Dome. The pastures of Turimiquiri become less rich in\r\nproportion to the elevation. Wherever scattered rocks afford shade,\r\nlichens and some European mosses are found. The Melastoma guacito,*\r\n(* Melastoma xanthostachys, called guacito at Caracas.) and a\r\nshrub, the large and tough leaves of which rustle like parchment*\r\nwhen shaken by the winds, (* Palicourea rigida, chaparro bovo. In\r\nthe savannahs, or llanos, the same Castilian name is given to a\r\ntree of the family of the proteaceae.) rise here and there in the\r\nsavannah. But the principal ornament of the turf of these mountains\r\nis a liliaceous plant with golden flowers, the Marica\r\nmartinicensis. It is generally observed in the province of Cumana\r\nand Caracas only at 400 or 500 toises of elevation.* (* For\r\nexample, in the Montana de Avila, on the road from Caracas to La\r\nGuayra, and in the Silla de Caracas. The seeds of the marica are\r\nripe at the end of December.) The whole rocky mass of the\r\nTurimiquiri is composed of an alpine limestone, like that of\r\nCumanacoa, and a pretty thin strata of marl and quartzose\r\nsandstone. The limestone contains masses of brown oxidated iron and\r\ncarbonate of iron. I have observed in several places, and very\r\ndistinctly, that the sandstone not only reposes on the limestone,\r\nbut that this last rock frequently includes and alternates with the\r\nsandstone.\r\n\r\nWe distinguished clearly the round summit of the Turimiquiri and\r\nthe lofty peaks or, as they are called, the Cucuruchos, covered\r\nwith thick vegetation, and infested by tigers which are hunted for\r\nthe beauty of their skin. This round summit, which is covered with\r\nturf, is 707 toises above the level of the ocean. A ridge of steep\r\nrocks stretches out westward, and is broken at the distance of a\r\nmile by an enormous crevice that descends toward the gulf of\r\nCariaco. At the point which might be supposed to be the\r\ncontinuation of the ridge, two calcareous paps or peaks arise, the\r\nmost northern of which is the loftiest. It is this last which is\r\nmore particularly called the Cucurucho de Turimiquiri, and which is\r\nconsidered to be higher than the mountain of the Brigantine, so\r\nwell known by the sailors who frequent the coasts of Cumana. We\r\nmeasured, by angles of elevation, and a basis, rather short, traced\r\non the round summit, the peak of Cucurucho, which was about 350\r\ntoises higher than our station, so that its absolute height\r\nexceeded 1050 toises.\r\n\r\nThe view we enjoyed on the Turimiquiri is of vast extent, and\r\nhighly picturesque. From the summer to the ocean we perceived\r\nchains of mountains extended in parallel lines from east to west,\r\nand bounding longitudinal valleys. These valleys are intersected at\r\nright angles by an infinite number of small ravines, scooped out by\r\nthe torrents: the consequence is, that the lateral ranges are\r\ntransformed into so many rows of paps, some round and others\r\npyramidal. The ground in general is a gentle slope as far as the\r\nImposible; Farther on the precipices become bold, and continue so\r\nto the shore of the gulf of Cariaco. The form of this mass of\r\nmountains reminded us of the chain of the Jura; and the only plain\r\nthat presents itself is the valley of Cumanacoa. We seemed to look\r\ndown into the bottom of a funnel, in which we could distinguish,\r\namidst tufts of scattered trees, the Indian village of Aricagua.\r\nTowards the north, a narrow slip of land, the peninsula of Araya,\r\nformed a dark stripe on the sea, which, being illumined by the rays\r\nof the sun, reflected a strong light. Beyond the peninsula the\r\nhorizon was bounded by Cape Macanao, the black rocks of which rise\r\namid the waters like an immense bastion.\r\n\r\nThe farm of the Cocollar, situated at the foot of the Turimiquiri,\r\nis in latitude 19 degrees 9 minutes 32 seconds. I found the dip of\r\nthe needle 42.1 degrees. The needle oscillates 229 times in ten\r\nminutes. Possibly masses of brown iron-ore, included in the\r\ncalcareous rock, caused a slight augmentation in the intensity of\r\nthe magnetic forces.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of September we descended the Cocollar, toward the\r\nMission of San Antonio. After crossing several savannahs strewed\r\nwith large blocks of calcareous stone, we entered a thick forest.\r\nHaving passed two ridges of extremely steep mountains,* (* These\r\nridges, which are rather difficult to climb towards the end of the\r\nrainy season, are distinguished by the names of Los Yepes and\r\nFantasma.) we discovered a fine valley five or six leagues in\r\nlength, pretty uniformly following the direction of east and west.\r\nIn this valley are situated the Missions of San Antonio and\r\nGuanaguana; the first is famous on account of a small church with\r\ntwo towers, built of brick, in pretty good style, and ornamented\r\nwith columns of the Doric order. It is the wonder of the country.\r\nThe prefect of the Capuchins completed the building of this church\r\nin less than two summers, though he employed only the Indians of\r\nhis village. The mouldings of the capitals, the cornices, and a\r\nfrieze decorated with suns and arabesques, are executed in clay\r\nmixed with pounded brick. If we are surprised to find churches in\r\nthe purest Grecian style on the confines of Lapland,* (* At\r\nSkelefter, near Torneo.--Buch, Voyage en Norwege.) we are still\r\nmore struck with these first essays of art, in a region where\r\neverything indicates the wild state of man, and where the basis of\r\ncivilization has not been laid by Europeans more than forty years.\r\n\r\nI stopped at the Mission of San Antonio only to open the barometer,\r\nand to take a few altitudes of the sun. The elevation of the great\r\nsquare above Cumana is 216 toises. After having crossed the\r\nvillage, we forded the rivers Colorado and Guarapiche, both of\r\nwhich rise in the mountains of the Cocollar, and blend their waters\r\nlower down towards the east. The Colorado has a very rapid current,\r\nand becomes at its mouth broader than the Rhine. The Guarapiche, at\r\nits junction with the Rio Areo, is more than twenty-five fathoms\r\ndeep. Its banks are ornamented by a superb gramen, of which I made\r\na drawing two years afterward on ascending the river Magdalena. The\r\ndistich-leaved stalk of this gramen often reaches the height of\r\nfifteen or twenty feet.* (* Lata, or cana brava. It is a new genus,\r\nbetween aira and arundo. This colossal gramen looks like the donax\r\nof Italy. This, the arundinaria of the Mississippi, (ludolfia,\r\nWilld., miegia of Persoon,) and the bamboos, are the highest\r\ngramens of the New Continent. Its seed has been carried to St.\r\nDomingo, where its stalk is employed to thatch the negroes' huts.)\r\n\r\nTowards evening we reached the Mission of Guanaguana, the site of\r\nwhich is almost on a level with the village of San Antonio. The\r\nmissionary received us cordially; he was an old man, and he seemed\r\nto govern his Indians with great intelligence. The village has\r\nexisted only thirty years on the spot it now occupies. Before that\r\ntime it was more to the south, and was backed by a hill. It is\r\nastonishing with what facility the Indians are induced to remove\r\ntheir dwellings. There are villages in South America which in less\r\nthan half a century have thrice changed their situation. The native\r\nfinds himself attached by ties so feeble to the soil he inhabits,\r\nthat he receives with indifference the order to take down his house\r\nand to rebuild it elsewhere. A village changes its situation like a\r\ncamp. Wherever clay, reeds, and the leaves of the palm or heliconia\r\nare found, a house is built in a few days. These compulsory changes\r\nhave often no other motive than the caprice of a missionary, who,\r\nhaving recently arrived from Spain, fancies that the situation of\r\nthe Mission is feverish, or that it is not sufficiently exposed to\r\nthe winds. Whole villages have been transported several leagues,\r\nmerely because the monk did not find the prospect from his house\r\nsufficiently beautiful or extensive.\r\n\r\nGuanaguana has as yet no church. The old monk, who during thirty\r\nyears had lived in the forests of America, observed to us that the\r\nmoney of the community, or the produce of the labour of the\r\nIndians, was employed first in the construction of the missionary's\r\nhouse, next in that of the church, and lastly in the clothing of\r\nthe Indians. He gravely assured us that this order of things could\r\nnot be changed on any pretence, and that the Indians, who prefer a\r\nstate of nudity to the slightest clothing, are in no hurry for\r\ntheir turn in the destination of the funds. The spacious abode of\r\nthe padre had just been finished, and we had remarked with\r\nsurprise, that the house, the roof of which formed a terrace, was\r\nfurnished with a great number of chimneys that looked like turrets.\r\nThis, our host told us, was done to remind him of a country dear to\r\nhis recollection, and to picture to his mind the winters of Aragon\r\namid the heat of the torrid zone. The Indians of Guanaguana\r\ncultivate cotton for their own benefit as well as for that of the\r\nchurch and the missionary. The natives have machines of a very\r\nsimple construction to separate the cotton from the seeds. These\r\nare wooden cylinders of extremely small diameter, within which the\r\ncotton passes, and which are made to turn by a treadle. These\r\nmachines, however imperfect, are very useful, and they begin to be\r\nimitated in other Missions. The soil of Guanaguana is not less\r\nfertile than that of Aricagua, a small neighbouring village, which\r\nhas also preserved its ancient Indian name. An almuda of land, 1850\r\nsquare toises, produces in abundant years from 25 to 30 fanegas of\r\nmaize, each fanega weighing 100 pounds. But here, as in other\r\nplaces, where the bounty of nature retards industry, a very small\r\nnumber of acres are cleared, and the culture of alimentary plants\r\nis neglected. Scarcity of subsistence is felt, whenever the harvest\r\nis lost by a protracted drought. The Indians of Guanaguana related\r\nto us as a fact not uncommon, that in the preceding year they,\r\ntheir wives, and their children, had been for three months al\r\nmonte; by which they meant, wandering in the neighbouring forests,\r\nto live on succulent plants, palm-cabbages, fern roots, and fruits\r\nof wild trees. They did not speak of this nomad life as of a state\r\nof privation.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful valley of Guanaguana stretches towards the east,\r\nopening into the plains of Punzera and Terecen. We wished to visit\r\nthose plains, and examine the springs of petroleum, lying between\r\nthe river Guarapiche and the Rio Areo; but the rainy season had\r\nalready arrived, and we were in daily perplexity how to dry and\r\npreserve the plants we had collected. The road from Guanaguana to\r\nthe village of Punzera runs either by San Felix or by Caycara and\r\nGuayuta, which is a farm for cattle (hato) of the missionaries. In\r\nthis last place, according to the report of the Indians, great\r\nmasses of sulphur are found, not in a gypseous or calcareous rock,\r\nbut at a small depth below the soil, in a bed of clay. This\r\nsingular phenomenon appears to me peculiar to America; we found it\r\nalso in the kingdom of Quito, and in New Spain. On approaching\r\nPunzera, we saw in the savannahs small bags, formed of a silky\r\ntissue suspended from the branches of the lowest trees. It is the\r\nseda silvestre, or wild silk of the country, which has a beautiful\r\nlustre, but is very rough to the touch. The phalaena which produces\r\nit is probably analogous with that of the provinces of Gua[?]uato\r\nand Antioquia, which also furnish wild silk. We found in the\r\nbeautiful forest of Punzera two trees known by the names of curucay\r\nand canela; the former, of which we shall speak hereafter, yields a\r\nresin very much sought after by the Piaches, or Indian sorcerers;\r\nthe leaves of the latter have the smell of the real cinnamon of\r\nCeylon.* (* Is this the Laurus cinnamomoides of Mutis? What is that\r\nother cinnamon tree which the Indians call tuorco, common in the\r\nmountains of Tocayo, and at the sources of the Rio Uchere, the bark\r\nof which is mixed with chocolate? Father Caulin gives the name of\r\ncurucay to the Copaifera officinalis, which yields the Balsam of\r\nCapivi.--Hist. Corograf., pages 24 and 34.) From Punzera the road\r\nleads by Terecin and Nueva Palencia, (a new colony of Canarians,)\r\nto the port of San Juan, situated on the right bank of the river\r\nAreo; and it is only by crossing this river in a canoe, that the\r\ntraveller can arrive at the famous petroleum springs (or mineral\r\ntar) of the Buen Pastor. They were described to us as small wells\r\nor funnels, hollowed out by nature in a marshy soil. This\r\nphenomenon reminded us of the lake of asphaltum, or of chopapote,\r\nin the island of Trinidad,* (* Laguna de la Brea, south-east of the\r\nport of Naparima. There is another spring of asphaltum on the\r\neastern coast of the island, in the bay of Mayaro.) which is\r\ndistant from the Buen Pastor, in a straight line, only thirty-five\r\nsea leagues.\r\n\r\nHaving long struggled to overcome the desire we felt to descend the\r\nGuarapiche to the Golfo Triste, we took the direct road to the\r\nmountains. The valleys of Guanaguana and Caripe are separated by a\r\nkind of dyke, or calcareous ridge, well known by the name of the\r\nCuchilla* de Guanaguana. (* Literally \"blade of a knife\".\r\nThroughout all Spanish America the name of \"cuchilla\" is given to\r\nthe ridge of a mountain terminated on each side by very steep\r\ndeclivities.) We found this passage difficult, because at that time\r\nwe had not climbed the Cordilleras; but it is by no means so\r\ndangerous as the people at Cumana love to represent it. The path is\r\nindeed in several parts only fourteen or fifteen inches broad; and\r\nthe ridge of the mountain, along which the road runs, is covered\r\nwith a short slippery turf. The slopes on each side are steep, and\r\nthe traveller, should he stumble, might slide down to the depth of\r\nseven or eight hundred feet. Nevertheless, the flanks of the\r\nmountain are steep declivities rather than precipices; and the\r\nmules of this country are so sure-footed that they inspire the\r\ngreatest confidence. Their habits are identical with those of the\r\nbeasts of burden in Switzerland and the Pyrenees. In proportion as\r\na country is wild, the instinct of domestic animals improves in\r\naddress and sagacity. When the mules feel themselves in danger,\r\nthey stop, turning their heads to the right and to the left; and\r\nthe motion of their ears seems to indicate that they reflect on the\r\ndecision they ought to take. Their resolution is slow, but always\r\njust, if it be spontaneous; that is to say, if it be not thwarted\r\nor hastened by the imprudence of the traveller. On the frightful\r\nroads of the Andes, during journeys of six or seven months across\r\nmountains furrowed by torrents, the intelligence of horses and\r\nbeasts of burden is manifested in an astonishing manner. Thus the\r\nmountaineers are heard to say, \"I will not give you the mule whose\r\nstep is the easiest, but the one which is most intelligent (la mas\r\nracional).\" This popular expression, dictated by long experience,\r\nbears stronger evidence against the theory of animated machines,\r\nthan all the arguments of speculative philosophy.\r\n\r\nWhen we had reached the highest point of the ridge or cuchilla of\r\nGuanaguana, an interesting spectacle unfolded itself before us. We\r\nsaw comprehended in one view the vast savannahs or meadows of\r\nMaturin and of the Rio Tigre;* (* These natural meadows are part of\r\nthe llanos or immense steppes bordered by the Orinoco.) the peak of\r\nthe Turimiquiri;* (* El Cucurucho.) and an infinite number of\r\nparallel ridges, which, seen at a distance, looked like the waves\r\nof the sea. On the north-east opens the valley in which is situated\r\nthe convent of Caripe. The aspect of this valley is peculiarly\r\nattractive, for being shaded by forests, it forms a strong contrast\r\nwith the nudity of the neighbouring mountains, which are bare of\r\ntrees, and covered with gramineous plants. We found the absolute\r\nheight of the Cuchilla to be 548 toises.\r\n\r\nDescending from the ridge by a winding path, we entered into a\r\ncompletely woody country. The soil is covered with moss, and a new\r\nspecies of drosera,* (* Drosera tenella.) which by its form\r\nreminded us of the drosera of the Alps. The thickness of the\r\nforests, and the force of vegetation, augmented as we approached\r\nthe convent of Caripe. Everything here changes its aspect, even to\r\nthe rock that accompanied us from Punta Delgada. The calcareous\r\nstrata becomes thinner, forming graduated steps, which stretch out\r\nlike walls, cornices, and turrets, as in the mountains of Jura,\r\nthose of Pappenheim in Germany, and near Oizow in Galicia. The\r\ncolour of the stone is no longer of a smoky or bluish grey; it\r\nbecomes white; its fracture is smooth, and sometimes even\r\nimperfectly conchoidal. It is no longer the calcareous formation of\r\nthe Higher Alps, but a formation to which this serves as a basis,\r\nand which is analogous to the Jura limestone. In the chain of the\r\nApennines, between Rome and Nocera, I observed this same immediate\r\nsuperposition.* (* In like manner, near Geneva, the rock of the\r\nMole, belonging to the Alpine limestone, lies under the Jura\r\nlimestone which forms Mount Saleve.) It indicates, not the\r\ntransition from one rock to another, but the geological affinity\r\nexisting between two formations. According to the general type of\r\nthe secondary strata, recognised in a great part of Europe, the\r\nAlpine limestone is separated from the Jura limestone by the\r\nmuriatiferous gypsum; but often this latter is entirely wanting, or\r\nis contained as a subordinate layer in the Alpine limestone. In\r\nthis case the two great calcareous formations succeed each other\r\nimmediately, or are confounded in one mass.\r\n\r\nThe descent from the Cuchilla is far shorter than the ascent. We\r\nfound the level of the valley of Caripe 200 toises higher than that\r\nof the valley of Guanaguana.* (* Absolute height of the convent\r\nabove the level of the sea, 412 toises.) A group of mountains of\r\nlittle breadth separates two valleys, one of which is of delicious\r\ncoolness, while the other is famed for the heat of its climate.\r\nThese contrasts, so common in Mexico, New Grenada, and Peru, are\r\nvery rare in the north-east part of South America. Thus Caripe is\r\nthe only one of the high valleys of New Andalusia which is much\r\ninhabited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.7.\r\n\r\nCONVENT OF CARIPE.\r\nCAVERN OF THE GUACHARO.\r\nNOCTURNAL BIRDS.\r\n\r\nAn alley of perseas led us to the Hospital of the Aragonese\r\nCapuchins. We stopped near a cross of Brazil-wood, erected in the\r\nmidst of a square, and surrounded with benches, on which the infirm\r\nmonks seat themselves to tell their rosaries. The convent is backed\r\nby an enormous wall of perpendicular rock, covered with thick\r\nvegetation. The stone, which is of resplendent whiteness, appears\r\nonly here and there between the foliage. It is difficult to imagine\r\na more picturesque spot. It recalled forcibly to my remembrance the\r\nvalleys of Derbyshire, and the cavernous mountains of Muggendorf,\r\nin Franconia. Instead of the beeches and maple trees of Europe we\r\nhere find the statelier forms of the ceiba and the palm-tree, the\r\npraga and irasse. Numberless springs gush from the sides of the\r\nrocks which encircle the basin of Caripe, and of which the abrupt\r\nslopes present, towards the south, profiles of a thousand feet in\r\nheight. These springs issue, for the most part, from a few narrow\r\ncrevices. The humidity which they spread around favours the growth\r\nof the great trees; and the natives, who love solitary places, form\r\ntheir conucos along the sides of these crevices. Plantains and\r\npapaw trees are grouped together with groves of arborescent fern;\r\nand this mixture of wild and cultivated plants gives the place a\r\npeculiar charm. Springs are distinguished from afar, on the naked\r\nflanks of the mountains, by tufted masses of vegetation* which at\r\nfirst sight seem suspended from the rocks, and descending into the\r\nvalley, they follow the sinuosities of the torrents.* (* Among the\r\ninteresting plants of the valley of Caripe, we found for the first\r\ntime a calidium, the trunk of which was twenty feet high (C.\r\narboreum); the Mikania micrantha, which may probably possess some\r\nof the alexipharmic properties of the famous guaco of the Choco;\r\nthe Bauhinia obtusifolia, a very large tree, called guarapa by the\r\nIndians; the Weinnannia glabra; a tree psychotria, the capsules of\r\nwhich, when rubbed between the fingers, emit a very agreeable\r\norange smell; the Dorstenia Houstoni (raiz de resfriado); the\r\nMartynia Craniolaria, the white flowers of which are six or seven\r\ninches long; a scrophularia, having the aspect of the Verbascum\r\nmiconi, and the leaves of which, all radical and hairy, are marked\r\nwith silvery glands.)\r\n\r\nWe were received with great hospitality by the monks of Caripe. The\r\nbuilding has an inner court, surrounded by an arcade, like the\r\nconvents in Spain. This enclosed place was highly convenient for\r\nsetting up our instruments and making observations. We found a\r\nnumerous society in the convent. Young monks, recently arrived from\r\nSpain, were just about to settle in the Missions, while old infirm\r\nmissionaries sought for health in the fresh and salubrious air of\r\nthe mountains of Caripe. I was lodged in the cell of the superior,\r\nwhich contained a pretty good collection of books. I found there,\r\nto my surprise, the Teatro Critico of Feijoo, the Lettres\r\nEdifiantes, and the Traite d'Electricite by abbe Nollet. It seemed\r\nas if the progress of knowledge advanced even in the forests of\r\nAmerica. The youngest of the capuchin monks of the last Mission had\r\nbrought with him a Spanish translation of Chaptal's Treatise on\r\nChemistry, and he intended to study this work in the solitude where\r\nhe was destined to pass the remainder of his days. During our long\r\nabode in the Missions of South America we never perceived any sign\r\nof intolerance. The monks of Caripe were not ignorant that I was\r\nborn in the protestant part of Germany. Furnished as I was with\r\norders from the court of Spain, I had no motives to conceal from\r\nthem this fact; nevertheless, no mark of distrust, no indiscreet\r\nquestion, no attempt at controversy, ever diminished the value of\r\nthe hospitality they exercised with so much liberality and\r\nfrankness.\r\n\r\nThe convent is founded on a spot which was anciently called\r\nAreocuar. Its height above the level of the sea is nearly the same\r\nas that of the town of Caracas, or of the inhabited part of the\r\nBlue Mountains of Jamaica. Thus the mean temperatures of these\r\nthree points, all situated within the tropics, are nearly the same.\r\nThe necessity of being well clothed at night, and especially at\r\nsunrise, is felt at Caripe. We saw the centigrade thermometer at\r\nmidnight, between 16 and 17.5 degrees; in the morning, between 19\r\nand 20 degrees. About one o'clock it had risen only to 21, or 22.5\r\ndegrees. This temperature is sufficient for the development of the\r\nproductions of the torrid zone; though, compared with the excessive\r\nheat of the plains of Cumana, we might call it the temperature of\r\nspring. Water exposed to currents of air in vessels of porous clay,\r\ncools at Caripe, during the night, as low as 13 degrees.\r\n\r\nExperience has proved that the temperate climate and rarefied air\r\nof this spot are singularly favourable to the cultivation of the\r\ncoffee-tree, which is well known to flourish on heights. The\r\nprefect of the capuchins, an active and enlightened man, has\r\nintroduced into the province this new branch of agricultural\r\nindustry. Indigo was formerly planted at Caripe, but the small\r\nquantity of fecula yielded by this plant, which requires great\r\nheat, caused the culture to be abandoned. We found in the conuco of\r\nthe community many culinary plants, maize, sugar cane, and five\r\nthousand coffee-trees, which promised a fine harvest. The friars\r\nwere in hopes of tripling the number in a few years. We cannot help\r\nremarking the uniform efforts for the cultivation of the soil which\r\nare manifested in the policy of the monastic hierarchy. Wherever\r\nconvents have not yet acquired wealth in the New Continent, as\r\nformerly in Gaul, in Syria, and in the north of Europe, they\r\nexercise a happy influence on the clearing of the ground and the\r\nintroduction of exotic vegetation. At Caripe, the conuco of the\r\ncommunity presents the appearance of an extensive and beautiful\r\ngarden. The natives are obliged to work in it every morning from\r\nsix to ten, and the alcaldes and alguazils of Indian race overlook\r\ntheir labours. These men are looked upon as great state\r\nfunctionaries, and they alone have the right of carrying a cane.\r\nThe selection of them depends on the superior of the convent. The\r\npedantic and silent gravity of the Indian alcaldes, their cold and\r\nmysterious air, their love of appearing in form at church and in\r\nthe assemblies of the people, force a smile from Europeans. We were\r\nnot yet accustomed to these shades of the Indian character, which\r\nwe found the same at the Orinoco, in Mexico, and in Peru, among\r\npeople totally different in their manners and their language. The\r\nalcaldes came daily to the convent, less to treat with the monks on\r\nthe affairs of the Mission, than under the pretence of inquiring\r\nafter the health of the newly-arrived travellers. As we gave them\r\nbrandy, their visits became more frequent than the monks desired.\r\n\r\nThat which confers most celebrity on the valley of Caripe, besides\r\nthe extraordinary coolness of its climate, is the great Cueva, or\r\nCavern of the Guacharo.* (* The province of Guacharucu, which\r\nDelgado visited in 1534, in the expedition of Hieronimo de Ortal,\r\nappears to have been situated south or south-east of Macarapana.\r\nHas its name any connexion with those of the cavern and the bird?\r\nor is this last of Spanish origin? (Laet Nova Orbis page 676).\r\nGuacharo means in Castilian \"one who cries and laments;\" now the\r\nbird of the cavern of Caripe, and the guacharaca (Phasianus\r\nparraka) are very noisy birds.) In a country where the people love\r\nthe marvellous, a cavern which gives birth to a river, and is\r\ninhabited by thousands of nocturnal birds, the fat of which is\r\nemployed in the Missions to dress food, is an everlasting object of\r\nconversation and discussion. The cavern, which the natives call \"a\r\nmine of fat\" is not in the valley of Caripe itself, but three short\r\nleagues distant from the convent, in the direction of\r\nwest-south-west. It opens into a lateral valley, which terminates\r\nat the Sierra del Guacharo.\r\n\r\nWe set out for the Sierra on the 18th of September, accompanied by\r\nthe alcaldes, or Indian magistrates, and the greater part of the\r\nmonks of the convent. A narrow path led us at first towards the\r\nsouth, across a fine plain, covered with beautiful turf. We then\r\nturned westward, along the margin of a small river which issues\r\nfrom the mouth of the cavern. We ascended during three quarters of\r\nan hour, sometimes in the water, which was shallow, sometimes\r\nbetween the torrent and a wall of rocks, on a soil extremely\r\nslippery and miry. The falling down of the earth, the scattered\r\ntrunks of trees, over which the mules could scarcely pass, and the\r\ncreeping plants that covered the ground, rendered this part of the\r\nroad fatiguing. We were surprised to find here, at scarcely 500\r\ntoises above the level of the sea, a cruciferous plant, Raphanus\r\npinnatus. Plants of this family are very rare in the tropics; they\r\nhave in some sort a northern character, and therefore we never\r\nexpected to see one on the plain of Caripe at so inconsiderable an\r\nelevation. The northern character also appears in the Galium\r\ncaripense, the Valeriana scandens, and a sanicle not unlike the S.\r\nmarilandica.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the lofty mountain of the Guacharo, we were only\r\nfour hundred paces from the cavern, without yet perceiving the\r\nentrance. The torrent runs in a crevice hollowed out by the waters,\r\nand we went on under a cornice, the projection of which prevented\r\nus from seeing the sky. The path winds in the direction of the\r\nriver; and at the last turning we came suddenly before the immense\r\nopening of the grotto. The aspect of this spot is majestic, even to\r\nthe eye of a traveller accustomed to the picturesque scenery of the\r\nhigher Alps. I had before this seen the caverns of the peak of\r\nDerbyshire, where, lying down flat in a boat, we proceeded along a\r\nsubterranean river, under an arch two feet high. I had visited the\r\nbeautiful grotto of Treshemienshiz, in the Carpathian mountains,\r\nthe caverns of the Hartz, and those of Franconia, which are vast\r\ncemeteries,* containing bones of tigers, hyenas, and bears, as\r\nlarge as our horses. (* The mould, which has covered for thousands\r\nof years the soil of the caverns of Gaylenreuth and Muggendorf in\r\nFranconia, emits even now choke-damps, or gaseous mixtures of\r\nhydrogen and nitrogen, which rise to the roof of the caves. This\r\nfact is known to the persons who show these caverns to travellers;\r\nand when I was director of the mines of the Fichtelberg, I observed\r\nit frequently in the summer-time. M. Laugier found in the mould of\r\nMuggendorf, besides phosphate of lime, 0.10 of animal matter. I was\r\nstruck, during my stay at Steeben, with the ammoniacal and fetid\r\nsmell produced by it, when thrown on a red-hot iron.) Nature in\r\nevery zone follows immutable laws in the distribution of rocks, in\r\nthe form of mountains, and even in those changes which the exterior\r\ncrust of our planet has undergone. So great a uniformity led me to\r\nbelieve that the aspect of the cavern of Caripe would differ little\r\nfrom what I had observed in my preceding travels. The reality far\r\nexceeded my expectations. If the configuration of the grottoes, the\r\nsplendour of the stalactites, and all the phenomena of inorganic\r\nnature, present striking analogies, the majesty of equinoctial\r\nvegetation gives at the same time an individual character to the\r\naperture of the cavern.\r\n\r\nThe Cueva del Guacharo is pierced in the vertical profile of a\r\nrock. The entrance is towards the south, and forms an arch eighty\r\nfeet broad and seventy-two high. The rock which surmounts the\r\ngrotto is covered with trees of gigantic height. The mammee-tree\r\nand the genipa,* (* Caruto, Genipa americana. The flower at Caripe,\r\nhas sometimes five, sometimes six stamens.) with large and shining\r\nleaves, raise their branches vertically towards the sky; whilst\r\nthose of the courbaril and the erythrina form, as they extend, a\r\nthick canopy of verdure. Plants of the family of pothos, with\r\nsucculent stems, oxalises, and orchideae of a singular structure,*\r\n(* A dendrobium, with a gold-coloured flower, spotted with black,\r\nthree inches long.) rise in the driest clefts of the rocks; while\r\ncreeping plants waving in the winds are interwoven in festoons\r\nbefore the opening of the cavern. We distinguished in these\r\nfestoons a bignonia of a violet blue, the purple dolichos, and for\r\nthe first time, that magnificent solandra,* (* Solandra scandens.\r\nIt is the gousaticha of the Chayma Indians.) which has an\r\norange-coloured flower and a fleshy tube more than four inches\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nBut this luxury of vegetation embellishes not only the external\r\narch, it appears even in the vestibule of the grotto. We saw with\r\nastonishment plantain-leaved heliconias eighteen feet high, the\r\npraga palm-tree, and arborescent arums, following the course of the\r\nriver, even to those subterranean places. The vegetation continues\r\nin the cave of Caripe as in those deep crevices of the Andes,\r\nhalf-excluded from the light of day, and does not disappear till,\r\npenetrating into the interior, we advance thirty or forty paces\r\nfrom the entrance. We measured the way by means of a cord; and we\r\nwent on about four hundred and thirty feet without being obliged to\r\nlight our torches. Daylight penetrates far into this region,\r\nbecause the grotto forms but one single channel, keeping the same\r\ndirection, from south-east to north-west. Where the light began to\r\nfail, we heard from afar the hoarse sounds of the nocturnal birds;\r\nsounds which the natives think belong exclusively to those\r\nsubterraneous places.\r\n\r\nThe guacharo is of the size of our fowls. It has the mouth of the\r\ngoat-suckers and procnias, and the port of those vultures whose\r\ncrooked beaks are surrounded with stiff silky hairs. Suppressing,\r\nwith M. Cuvier, the order of picae, we must refer this\r\nextraordinary bird to the passeres, the genera of which are\r\nconnected with each other by almost imperceptible transitions. It\r\nforms a new genus, very different from the goatsucker, in the\r\nloudness of its voice, in the vast strength of its beak (containing\r\na double tooth), and in its feet without the membranes which unite\r\nthe anterior phalanges of the claws. It is the first example of a\r\nnocturnal bird among the Passeres dentirostrati. Its habits present\r\nanalogies both with those of the goatsuckers and of the alpine\r\ncrow.* (* Corvus Pyrrhocorax.) The plumage of the guacharo is of a\r\ndark bluish grey, mixed with small streaks and specks of black.\r\nLarge white spots of the form of a heart, and bordered with black,\r\nmark the head, wings, and tail. The eyes of the bird, which are\r\ndazzled by the light of day, are blue, and smaller than those of\r\nthe goatsucker. The spread of the wings, which are composed of\r\nseventeen or eighteen quill feathers, is three feet and a half. The\r\nguacharo quits the cavern at nightfall, especially when the moon\r\nshines. It is almost the only frugiferous nocturnal bird yet known;\r\nthe conformation of its feet sufficiently shows that it does not\r\nhunt like our owls. It feeds on very hard fruits, like the\r\nnutcracker* (* Corvus caryocatactes, C. glandarius. Our Alpine crow\r\nbuilds its nest near the top of Mount Libanus, in subterranean\r\ncaverns, nearly like the guacharo. It also has the horribly shrill\r\ncry of the latter.) and the pyrrhocorax. The latter nestles also in\r\nclefts of rocks, and is known by the name of the night-crow. The\r\nIndians assured us that the guacharo does not pursue either the\r\nlamellicornous insects or those phalaenae which serve as food to\r\nthe goatsuckers. A comparison of the beaks of the guacharo and the\r\ngoatsucker serves to denote how much their habits must differ. It\r\nwould be difficult to form an idea of the horrible noise occasioned\r\nby thousands of these birds in the dark part of the cavern. Their\r\nshrill and piercing cries strike upon the vaults of the rocks, and\r\nare repeated by the subterranean echoes. The Indians showed us the\r\nnests of the guacharos by fixing a torch to the end of a long pole.\r\nThese nests were fifty or sixty feet high above our heads, in holes\r\nin the shape of funnels, with which the roof of the grotto is\r\npierced like a sieve. The noise increased as we advanced, and the\r\nbirds were scared by the light of the torches of copal. When this\r\nnoise ceased a few minutes around us, we heard at a distance the\r\nplaintive cries of the birds roosting in other ramifications of the\r\ncavern. It seemed as if different groups answered each other\r\nalternately.\r\n\r\nThe Indians enter the Cueva del Guacharo once a year, near\r\nmidsummer. They go armed with poles, with which they destroy the\r\ngreater part of the nests. At that season several thousand birds\r\nare killed; and the old ones, as if to defend their brood, hover\r\nover the heads of the Indians, uttering terrible cries. The young,*\r\n(* Called Los pollos del Guacharo.) which fall to the ground, are\r\nopened on the spot. Their peritoneum is found extremely loaded with\r\nfat, and a layer of fat reaches from the abdomen to the anus,\r\nforming a kind of cushion between the legs of the bird. This\r\nquantity of fat in frugivorous animals, not exposed to the light,\r\nand exerting very little muscular motion, reminds us of what has\r\nbeen observed in the fattening of geese and oxen. It is well known\r\nhow greatly darkness and repose favour this process. The nocturnal\r\nbirds of Europe are lean, because, instead of feeding on fruits,\r\nlike the guacharo, they live on the scanty produce of their prey.\r\nAt the period commonly called, at Caripe, the oil harvest,* (* La\r\ncosecha de la manteca.) the Indians build huts with palm-leaves,\r\nnear the entrance, and even in the porch of the cavern. There, with\r\na fire of brushwood, they melt in pots of clay the fat of the young\r\nbirds just killed. This fat is known by the name of butter or oil\r\n(manteca, or aceite) of the guacharo. It is half liquid,\r\ntransparent, without smell, and so pure that it may be kept above a\r\nyear without becoming rancid. At the convent of Caripe no other oil\r\nis used in the kitchen of the monks but that of the cavern; and we\r\nnever observed that it gave the aliments a disagreeable taste or\r\nsmell.\r\n\r\nThe race of the guacharos would have been long ago extinct, had not\r\nseveral circumstances contributed to its preservation. The natives,\r\nrestrained by their superstitious ideas, seldom have courage to\r\npenetrate far into the grotto. It appears also, that birds of the\r\nsame species dwell in neighbouring caverns, which are too narrow to\r\nbe accessible to man. Perhaps the great cavern is repeopled by\r\ncolonies which forsake the small grottoes; for the missionaries\r\nassured us that hitherto no sensible diminution of the birds has\r\nbeen observed. Young guacharos have been sent to the port of\r\nCumana, and have lived there several days without taking any\r\nnourishment, the seeds offered to them not suiting their taste.\r\nWhen the crops and gizzards of the young birds are opened in the\r\ncavern, they are found to contain all sorts of hard and dry fruits,\r\nwhich furnish, under the singular name of guacharo seed (semilla\r\ndel guacharo), a very celebrated remedy against intermittent\r\nfevers. The old birds carry these seeds to their young. They are\r\ncarefully collected, and sent to the sick at Cariaco, and other\r\nplaces of the low regions, where fevers are generally prevalent.\r\n\r\nAs we continued to advance into the cavern, we followed the banks\r\nof the small river which issues from it, and is from twenty-eight\r\nto thirty feet wide. We walked on the banks, as far as the hills\r\nformed of calcareous incrustations permitted us. Where the torrent\r\nwinds among very high masses of stalactites, we were often obliged\r\nto descend into its bed, which is only two feet deep. We learned\r\nwith surprise, that this subterranean rivulet is the origin of the\r\nriver Caripe, which, at the distance of a few leagues, where it\r\njoins the small river of Santa Maria, is navigable for canoes. It\r\nflows into the river Areo under the name of Cano do Terezen. We\r\nfound on the banks of the subterranean rivulet a great quantity of\r\npalm-tree wood, the remains of trunks, on which the Indians climb\r\nto reach the nests hanging from the roofs of the cavern. The rings,\r\nformed by the vestiges of the old footstalks of the leaves, furnish\r\nas it were the steps of a ladder perpendicularly placed.\r\n\r\nThe Grotto of Caripe preserves the same direction, the same\r\nbreadth, and its primitive height of sixty or seventy feet, to the\r\ndistance of 472 metres, or 1458 feet, accurately measured. We had\r\ngreat difficulty in persuading the Indians to pass beyond the\r\nanterior portion of the grotto, the only part which they annually\r\nvisit to collect the fat. The whole authority of 'los padres' was\r\nnecessary to induce them to advance as far as the spot where the\r\nsoil rises abruptly at an inclination of sixty degrees, and where\r\nthe torrent forms a small subterranean cascade.* (* We find the\r\nphenomenon of a subterranean cascade, but on a much larger scale,\r\nin England, at Yordas Cave, near Kingsdale in Yorkshire.) The\r\nnatives connect mystic ideas with this cave, inhabited by nocturnal\r\nbirds; they believe that the souls of their ancestors sojourn in\r\nthe deep recesses of the cavern. \"Man,\" say they, \"should avoid\r\nplaces which are enlightened neither by the sun (zis), nor by the\r\nmoon (nuna).\" 'To go and join the guacharos,' is with them a phrase\r\nsignifying to rejoin their fathers, to die. The magicians (piaches)\r\nand the poisoners (imorons) perform their nocturnal tricks at the\r\nentrance of the cavern, to conjure the chief of the evil spirits\r\n(ivorokiamo). Thus in every region of the earth a resemblance may\r\nbe traced in the early fictions of nations, those especially which\r\nrelate to two principles governing the world, the abode of souls\r\nafter death, the happiness of the virtuous and the punishment of\r\nthe guilty. The most different and most barbarous languages present\r\na certain number of images, which are the same, because they have\r\ntheir source in the nature of our intelligence and our sensations.\r\nDarkness is everywhere connected with the idea of death. The Grotto\r\nof Caripe is the Tartarus of the Greeks; and the guacharos, which\r\nhover over the rivulet, uttering plaintive cries, remind us of the\r\nStygian birds.\r\n\r\nAt the point where the river forms the subterranean cascade, a hill\r\ncovered with vegetation, which is opposite to the opening of the\r\ngrotto, presents a very picturesque aspect. It is seen at the\r\nextremity of a straight passage, 240 toises in length. The\r\nstalactites descending from the roof, and resembling columns\r\nsuspended in the air, are relieved on a back-ground of verdure. The\r\nopening of the cavern appeared singularly contracted, when we saw\r\nit about the middle of the day, illumined by the vivid light\r\nreflected at once from the sky, the plants, and the rocks. The\r\ndistant light of day formed a strange contrast with the darkness\r\nwhich surrounded us in the vast cavern. We discharged our guns at a\r\nventure, wherever the cries of the nocturnal birds and the flapping\r\nof their wings, led us to suspect that a great number of nests were\r\ncrowded together. After several fruitless attempts M. Bonpland\r\nsucceeded in killing a couple of guacharos, which, dazzled by the\r\nlight of the torches, seemed to pursue us. This circumstance\r\nafforded me the means of making a drawing of this bird, which had\r\npreviously been unknown to naturalists. We climbed, not without\r\ndifficulty, the small hill whence the subterranean rivulet\r\ndescends. We saw that the grotto was perceptibly contracted,\r\nretaining only forty feet in height, and that it continued\r\nstretching to north-east, without deviating from its primitive\r\ndirection, which is parallel to that of the great valley of Caripe.\r\n\r\nIn this part of the cavern, the rivulet deposits a blackish mould,\r\nvery like the matter which, in the grotto of Muggendorf, in\r\nFranconia, is called \"the earth of sacrifice.\"* (* Opfer-erde of\r\nthe cavern of Hohle Berg (or Hole Mountain,--a mountain pierced\r\nentirely through.)) We could not discover whether this fine and\r\nspongy mould falls through the cracks which communicate with the\r\nsurface of the ground above, or is washed down by the rain-water\r\npenetrating into the cavern. It was a mixture of silex, alumina,\r\nand vegetable detritus. We walked in thick mud to a spot where we\r\nbeheld with astonishment the progress of subterranean vegetation.\r\nThe seeds which the birds carry into the grotto to feed their\r\nyoung, spring up wherever they fix in the mould which covers the\r\ncalcareous incrustations. Blanched stalks, with some half-formed\r\nleaves, had risen to the height of two feet. It was impossible to\r\nascertain the species of these plants, their form, colour, and\r\naspect having been changed by the absence of light. These traces of\r\norganization amidst darkness forcibly excited the curiosity of the\r\nnatives, who examined them with silent meditation inspired by a\r\nplace they seemed to dread. They evidently regarded these\r\nsubterranean plants, pale and deformed, as phantoms banished from\r\nthe face of the earth. To me the scene recalled one of the happiest\r\nperiods of my early youth, a long abode in the mines of Freyberg,\r\nwhere I made experiments on the effects of blanching (etiolement),\r\nwhich are very different, according as the air is pure or\r\novercharged with hydrogen or azote.\r\n\r\nThe missionaries, with all their authority, could not prevail on\r\nthe Indians to penetrate farther into the cavern. As the roof\r\nbecame lower the cries of the guacharos were more and more shrill.\r\nWe were obliged to yield to the pusillanimity of our guides, and\r\ntrace back our steps. The appearance of the cavern was however very\r\nuniform. We found that a bishop of St. Thomas of Guiana had gone\r\nfarther than ourselves. He had measured nearly 2500 feet from the\r\nmouth to the spot where he stopped, but the cavern extended still\r\nfarther. The remembrance of this fact was preserved in the convent\r\nof Caripe, without the exact period being noted. The bishop had\r\nprovided himself with great torches of white Castile wax. We had\r\ntorches composed only of the bark of trees and native resin. The\r\nthick smoke which issued from these torches, in a narrow\r\nsubterranean passage, hurts the eyes and obstructs the respiration.\r\n\r\nOn turning back to go out of the cavern, we followed the course of\r\nthe torrent. Before our eyes became dazzled with the light of day\r\nwe saw on the outside of the grotto the water of the river\r\nsparkling amid the foliage of the trees which shaded it. It was\r\nlike a picture placed in the distance, the mouth of the cavern\r\nserving as a frame. Having at length reached the entrance, we\r\nseated ourselves on the bank of the rivulet, to rest after our\r\nfatigues. We were glad to be beyond the hoarse cries of the birds,\r\nand to leave a place where darkness does not offer even the charm\r\nof silence and tranquillity. We could scarcely persuade ourselves\r\nthat the name of the Grotto of Caripe had hitherto been unknown in\r\nEurope;* for the guacharos alone might have sufficed to render it\r\ncelebrated. (* It is surprising that Father Gili, author of the\r\nSaggio di Storia Americana, does not mention it, though he had in\r\nhis possession a manuscript written in 1780 at the convent of\r\nCaripe. I gave the first information respecting the Cueva del\r\nGuacharo in 1800, in my letters to Messrs. Delambre and\r\nDelametherie, published in the Journal de Physique.) These\r\nnocturnal birds have been no where yet discovered, except in the\r\nmountains of Caripe and Cumanacoa. The missionaries had prepared a\r\nrepast at the entry of the cavern. Leaves of the banana and the\r\nvijao,* (* Heliconia bihai, Linn. The Creoles have changed the b of\r\nthe Haitian word bihao into v, and the h into j, agreeably to the\r\nCastilian pronunciation.) which have a silky lustre, served us as a\r\ntable-cloth, according to the custom of the country. Nothing was\r\nwanting to our enjoyment, not even remembrances, which are so rare\r\nin those countries, where generations disappear without leaving a\r\ntrace of their existence.\r\n\r\nBefore we quit the subterranean rivulet and the nocturnal birds,\r\nlet us cast a last glance at the cavern of the Guacharo, and the\r\nwhole of the physical phenomena it presents. When we have step by\r\nstep pursued a long series of observations modified by the\r\nlocalities of a place, we love to stop and raise our views to\r\ngeneral considerations. Do the great cavities, which are\r\nexclusively called caverns, owe their origin to the same causes as\r\nthose which have produced the lodes of veins and of metalliferous\r\nstrata, or the extraordinary phenomenon of the porosity of rocks?\r\nDo grottoes belong to every formation, or to that period only when\r\norganized beings began to people the surface of the globe? These\r\ngeological questions can be solved only so far as they are directed\r\nby the actual state of things, that is, of facts susceptible of\r\nbeing verified by observation.\r\n\r\nConsidering rocks according to the succession of eras, we find that\r\nprimitive formations exhibit very few caverns. The great cavities\r\nwhich are observed in the oldest granite, and which are called\r\nfours (ovens) in Switzerland and in the south of France, when they\r\nare lined with rock crystals, arise most frequently from the union\r\nof several contemporaneous veins of quartz,* (* Gleichzeitige\r\nTrummer. To these stone veins which appear to be of the same age as\r\nthe rock, belong the veins of talc and asbestos in serpentine, and\r\nthose of quartz traversing schist (Thonschiefer). Jameson on\r\nContemporaneous Veins, in the Mem. of the Wernerian Soc.) of\r\nfeldspar, or of fine-grained granite. The gneiss presents, though\r\nmore seldom, the same phenomenon; and near Wunsiedel,* (* In\r\nFranconia, south-east of Luchsburg.) at the Fichtelgebirge, I had\r\nan opportunity of examining crystal fours of two or three feet\r\ndiameter, in a part of the rock not traversed by veins. We are\r\nignorant of the extent of the cavities which subterranean fires and\r\nvolcanic agitations may have produced in the bowels of the earth in\r\nthose primitive rocks, which, containing considerable quantities of\r\namphibole, mica, garnet, magnetic iron-stone, and red schorl\r\n(titanite), appear to be anterior to granite. We find some\r\nfragments of these rocks among the matters ejected by volcanoes.\r\nThe cavities can be considered only as partial and local phenomena;\r\nand their existence is scarcely any contradiction to the notions we\r\nhave acquired from the experiments of Maskelyne and Cavendish on\r\nthe mean density of the earth.\r\n\r\nIn the primitive mountains open to our researches, real grottoes,\r\nthose which have some extent, belong only to calcareous formations,\r\nsuch as the carbonate or sulphate of lime. The solubility of these\r\nsubstances appears to have favoured the action of the subterranean\r\nwaters for ages. The primitive limestone presents spacious caverns\r\nas well as transition limestone,* and that which is exclusively\r\ncalled secondary. (* In the primitive limestone are found the\r\nKuetzel-loch, near Kaufungen in Silesia, and probably several\r\ncaverns in the islands of the Archipelago. In the transition\r\nlimestone we remark the caverns of Elbingerode, of Rubeland, and of\r\nScharzfeld, in the Hartz; those of the Salzfluhe in the Grisons;\r\nand, according to Mr. Greenough, that of Torbay in Devonshire.) If\r\nthese caverns be less frequent in the first, it is because this\r\nstone forms in general only layers subordinate to the mica-slate,*\r\n(* Sometimes to gneiss, as at the Simplon, between Dovredo and\r\nCrevola.) and not a particular system of mountains, into which the\r\nwaters may filter, and circulate to great distances. The erosions\r\noccasioned by this element depend not only on its quantity, but\r\nalso on the length of time during which it remains, the velocity it\r\nacquires by its fall, and the degree of solubility of the rock. I\r\nhave observed in general, that the waters act more easily on the\r\ncarbonates and the sulphates of lime of secondary mountains than on\r\nthe transition limestones, which have a considerable mixture of\r\nsilex and carbon. On examining the internal structure of the\r\nstalactites which line the walls of caverns, we find in them all\r\nthe characters of a chemical precipitate.\r\n\r\nAs we approach those periods in which organic life develops itself\r\nin a greater number of forms, the phenomenon of grottoes becomes\r\nmore frequent. There exist several under the name of baumen,* (* In\r\nthe dialect of the German Swiss, Balmen. The Baumen of the Sentis,\r\nof the Mole, and of the Beatenberg, on the borders of the lake of\r\nThun, belong to the Alpine limestone.) not in the ancient sandstone\r\nto which the great coal formation belongs, but in the Alpine\r\nlimestone, and in the Jura limestone, which is often only the\r\nsuperior part of the Alpine formation. The Jura limestone* (* I may\r\nmention only the grottoes of Boudry, Motiers-Travers, and Valorbe,\r\nin the Jura; the grotto of Balme near Geneva; the caverns between\r\nMuggendorf and Gaylenreuth in Franconia; Sowia Jama, Ogrodzimiec,\r\nand Wlodowice, in Poland.) so abounds with caverns in both\r\ncontinents, that several geologists of the school of Freyberg have\r\ngiven it the name of cavern-limestone (hohlenkalkstein). It is this\r\nrock which so often interrupts the course of rivers, by engulfing\r\nthem into its bosom. In this also is formed the famous Cueva del\r\nGuacharo, and the other grottoes of the valley of Caripe. The\r\nmuriatiferous gypsum,* (* Gypsum of Bottendorf, schlottengyps.)\r\nwhether it be found in layers in the Jura or Alpine limestone, or\r\nwhether it separate these two formations, or lie between the Alpine\r\nlimestone and argillaceous sandstone, also presents, on account of\r\nits great solubility, enormous cavities, sometimes communicating\r\nwith each other at several leagues distance. After the limestone\r\nand gypseous formations, there would remain to be examined, among\r\nthe secondary rocks, a third formation, that of the argillaceous\r\nsandstone, newer than the brine-spring formations; but this rock,\r\ncomposed of small grains of quartz cemented by clay, seldom\r\ncontains caverns; and when it does, they are not extensive.\r\nProgressively narrowing towards their extremity, their walls are\r\ncovered with a brown ochre.\r\n\r\nWe have just seen, that the form of grottoes depends partly on the\r\nnature of the rocks in which they are found; but this form,\r\nmodified by exterior agents, often varies even in the same\r\nformation. The configuration of caverns, like the outline of\r\nmountains, the sinuosity of valleys, and so many other phenomena,\r\npresent at first sight only irregularity and confusion. The\r\nappearance of order is resumed, when we can extend our observations\r\nover a vast space of ground, which has undergone violent, but\r\nperiodical and uniform revolutions. From what I have seen in the\r\nmountains of Europe, and in the Cordilleras of America, caverns may\r\nbe divided, according to their interior structure, into three\r\nclasses. Some have the form of large clefts or crevices, like veins\r\nnot filled with ore; such as the cavern of Rosenmuller, in\r\nFranconia, Elden-hole, in the peak of Derbyshire, and the Sumideros\r\nof Chamacasapa in Mexico. Other caverns are open to the light at\r\nboth ends. These are rocks really pierced; natural galleries, which\r\nrun through a solitary mountain: such are the Hohleberg of\r\nMuggendorf, and the famous cavern called Dantoe by the Ottomite\r\nIndians, and the Bridge of the Mother of God, by the Mexican\r\nSpaniards. It is difficult to decide respecting the origin of these\r\nchannels, which sometimes serve as beds for subterranean rivers.\r\nAre these pierced rocks hollowed out by the impulse of a current?\r\nor should we rather admit that one of the openings of the cavern is\r\nowing to a falling down of the earth subsequent to its original\r\nformation; to a change in the external form of the mountain, for\r\ninstance, to a new valley opened on its flank? A third form of\r\ncaverns, and the most common of the whole, exhibits a succession of\r\ncavities, placed nearly on the same level, running in the same\r\ndirection, and communicating with each other by passages of greater\r\nor less breadth.\r\n\r\nTo these differences of general form are added other circumstances\r\nnot less remarkable. It often happens, that grottoes of little\r\nspace have extremely wide openings; whilst we have to creep under\r\nvery low vaults, in order to penetrate into the deepest and most\r\nspacious caverns. The passages which unite partial grottoes, are\r\ngenerally horizontal. I have seen some, however, which resemble\r\nfunnels or wells, and which may be attributed to the escape of some\r\nelastic fluid through a mass before being hardened. When rivers\r\nissue from grottoes, they form only a single, horizontal,\r\ncontinuous channel, the dilatations of which are almost\r\nimperceptible; as in the Cueva del Guacharo we have just described,\r\nand the cavern of San Felipe, near Tehuilotepec in the western\r\nCordilleras of Mexico. The sudden disappearance* of the river (* In\r\nthe night of the 16th April, 1802.), which took its rise from this\r\nlast cavern, has impoverished a district in which farmers and\r\nminers equally require water for refreshing the soil and for\r\nworking hydraulic machinery.\r\n\r\nConsidering the variety of structure exhibited by grottoes in both\r\nhemispheres, we cannot but refer their formation to causes totally\r\ndifferent. When we speak of the origin of caverns we must choose\r\nbetween two systems of natural philosophy: one of these systems\r\nattributes every thing to instantaneous and violent commotions (for\r\nexample, to the elastic force of vapours, and to the heavings\r\noccasioned by volcanoes); while the other rests on the operation of\r\nsmall powers, which produce effects almost insensibly by\r\nprogressive action. Those who love to indulge in geological\r\nhypotheses must not, however, forget the horizontality so often\r\nremarked amidst gypseous and calcareous mountains, in the position\r\nof grottoes communicating with each other by passages. This almost\r\nperfect horizontality, this gentle and uniform slope, appears to be\r\nthe result of a long abode of the waters, which enlarge by erosion\r\nclefts already existing, and carry off the softer parts the more\r\neasily, as clay or muriate of soda is found mixed with the gypsum\r\nand fetid limestone. These effects are the same, whether the\r\ncaverns form one long and continued range, or several of these\r\nranges lie one over another, as happens almost exclusively in\r\ngypseous mountains.\r\n\r\nThat which in shelly or Neptunean rocks is caused by the action of\r\nthe waters, appears sometimes to be in the volcanic rocks the\r\neffect of gaseous emanations* acting in the direction where they\r\nfind the least resistance. (* At Vesuvius, the Duke de la Torre\r\nshowed me, in 1805, in currents of recent lava, cavities extending\r\nin the direction of the current, six or seven feet long and three\r\nfeet high. These little volcanic caverns were lined with specular\r\niron, which cannot be called oligiste iron, since M. Gay-Lussac's\r\nlast experiments on the oxides of iron.) When melted matter moves\r\non a very gentle slope, the great axis of the cavity formed by the\r\nelastic fluids is nearly horizontal, or parallel to the plane on\r\nwhich the movement of transition takes place. A similar\r\ndisengagement of vapours, joined to the elastic force of the gases,\r\nwhich penetrate strata softened and raised up, appears sometimes to\r\nhave given great extent to the caverns found in trachytes or\r\ntrappean porphyries. These porphyritic caverns, in the Cordilleras\r\nof Quito and Peru, bear the Indian name of Machays.* (* Machay is a\r\nword of the Quichua language, commonly called by the Spaniards the\r\nIncas' language. Callancamachay means a cavern as large as a house,\r\na cavern that serves as a tambo or caravansarai.) They are in\r\ngeneral of little depth. They are lined with sulphur, and differ by\r\nthe enormous size of their openings from those observed in volcanic\r\ntufas* in Italy, at Teneriffe, and in the Andes. (*Sometimes fire\r\nacts like water in carrying off masses, and thus the cavities may\r\nbe caused by an igneous, though more frequently by an aqueous\r\nerosion or solution.) It is by connecting in the mind the\r\nprimitive, secondary, and volcanic rocks, and distinguishing\r\nbetween the oxidated crust of the globe, and the interior nucleus,\r\ncomposed perhaps of metallic and inflammable substances, that we\r\nmay account for the existence of grottoes everywhere. They act in\r\nthe economy of nature as vast reservoirs of water and of elastic\r\nfluids.\r\n\r\nThe gypseous caverns glitter with crystallized selenites. Vitreous\r\ncrystallized plates of brown and yellow stand out on a striated\r\nground composed of layers of alabaster and fetid limestone. The\r\ncalcareous grottoes have a more uniform tint. They are more\r\nbeautiful, and richer in stalactites, in proportion as they are\r\nnarrower, and the circulation of air is less free. By being\r\nspacious, and accessible to air, the cavern of Caripe is almost\r\ndestitute of those incrustations, the imitative forms of which are\r\nin other countries objects of popular curiosity. I also sought in\r\nvain for subterranean plants, those cryptogamia of the family of\r\nthe Usneaceae, which we sometimes find fixed on the stalactites,\r\nlike ivy on walls, when we penetrate for the first time into a\r\nlateral grotto.* (* Lichen tophicola was discovered when the\r\nbeautiful cavern of Rosenmuller in Franconia was first opened. The\r\ncavity containing the lichen was found closed on all sides by\r\nenormous masses of stalactite.)\r\n\r\nThe caverns in mountains of gypsum often contain mephitic\r\nemanations and deleterious gases. It is not the sulphate of lime\r\nthat acts on the atmospheric air, but the clay slightly mixed with\r\ncarbon, and the fetid limestone, so often mingled with the gypsum.\r\nWe cannot yet decide, whether the swinestone acts as a\r\nhydrosulphuret, or by means of a bituminous principle.* (* That\r\ndescription of fetid limestone called by the German mineralogists\r\nstinkstein is always of a blackish brown colour. It is only by\r\ndecomposition that it becomes white, after having acted on the\r\nsurrounding air. The stinkstein which is of secondary formation,\r\nmust not be confounded with a very white primitive granular\r\nlimestone of the island of Thasos, which emits, when scraped, a\r\nsmell of sulphuretted hydrogen. This marble is coarser grained than\r\nCarrara (Marmor lunense). It was frequently employed by the Grecian\r\nsculptors, and I often picked up fragments of it at the Villa\r\nAdriani, near Rome.) Its property of absorbing oxygen gas is known\r\nto all the miners of Thuringia. It is the same as the action of the\r\ncarburetted clay of the gypseous grottoes, and of the great\r\nchambers (sinkwerke) dug in mines of fossil salt which are worked\r\nby the introduction of fresh water. The caverns of calcareous\r\nmountains are not exposed to those decompositions of the\r\natmospheric air, unless they contain bones of quadrupeds, or the\r\nmould mixed with animal gluten and phosphate of lime, from which\r\narise inflammable and fetid gases.\r\n\r\nThough we made many enquiries among the inhabitants of Caripe,\r\nCumanacoa, and Cariaco, we did not learn that they had ever\r\ndiscovered in the cavern of Guacharo either the remains of\r\ncarnivorous animals, or those bony breccias of herbivorous animals,\r\nwhich are found in the caverns of Germany and Hungary, and in the\r\nclefts of the calcareous rocks of Gibraltar. The fossil bones of\r\nthe megatherium, of the elephant, and of the mastodon, which\r\ntravellers have brought from South America, have all been found in\r\nthe light soil of the valleys and table-lands. Excepting the\r\nmegalonyx,* a kind of sloth of the size of an ox, described by Mr.\r\nJefferson, I know not a single instance of the skeleton of an\r\nanimal buried in a cavern of the New World. (* The megalonyx was\r\nfound in the caverns of Green Briar, in Virginia, at the distance\r\nof 1500 leagues from the megatherium, which resembles it very much,\r\nand is of the size of the rhinoceros.) The extreme scarcity of this\r\ngeological phenomenon will appear the less surprising to us, if we\r\nrecollect, that in France, England, and Italy, there are also a\r\ngreat number of grottoes in which we have never met with any\r\nvestige of fossil bones.\r\n\r\nAlthough, in primitive nature, whatever relates to ideas of extent\r\nand mass is of no great importance, yet I may observe, that the\r\ncavern of Caripe is one of the most spacious known to exist in\r\nlimestone formations. It is at least 900 metres or 2800 feet in\r\nlength.* (* The famous Baumannshohle in the Hartz, according to\r\nMessrs. Gilbert and Ilsen, is only 578 feet in length; the cavern\r\nof Scharzfeld 350; that of Gaylenreuth 304; that of Antiparos 300.\r\nBut according to Saussure, the Grotto of Balme is 1300 feet.) Owing\r\nto the different degrees of solubility in rocks, it is generally\r\nnot in calcareous mountains, but in gypseous formations, that we\r\nfind the most extensive succession of grottoes. In Saxony there are\r\nsome in gypsum several leagues in length; for instance, that of\r\nWimelburg, which communicates with the cavern of Cresfield.\r\n\r\nThe determination of the temperature of grottoes presents a field\r\nfor interesting observation. The cavern of Caripe, situated nearly\r\nin the latitude of 10 degrees 10 minutes, consequently in the\r\ncentre of the torrid zone, is elevated 506 toises above the level\r\nof the sea in the gulf of Cariaco. We found that, in every part of\r\nit, in the month of September, the temperature of the internal air\r\nwas between 18.4 and 18.9 degrees of the centesimal thermometer;\r\nthe external atmosphere being at 16.2 degrees. At the entrance of\r\nthe cavern, the thermometer in the open air was at 17.6 degrees;\r\nbut when immersed in the water of the little subterranean river, it\r\nmarked, even to the end of the cavern, 16.8 degrees. These\r\nexperiments are very interesting, if we reflect on the tendency to\r\nequilibrium of heat, in the waters, the air, and the earth. When I\r\nleft Europe, men of science were regretting that they had not\r\nsufficient data on what is called the temperature of the interior\r\nof the globe; and it is but very recently that efforts have been\r\nmade, and with some success, to solve the grand problem of\r\nsubterranean meteorology. The stony strata that form the crust of\r\nour planet, are alone accessible to our examination; and we now\r\nknow that the mean temperature of these strata varies not only with\r\nlatitudes and heights, but that, according to the position of the\r\nseveral places, it performs also, in the space of a year, regular\r\noscillations round the mean heat of the neighbouring atmosphere.\r\nThe time is gone by when men were surprised to find, in other\r\nzones, the heat of grottoes and wells differing from that observed\r\nin the caves of the observatory at Paris. The same instrument which\r\nin those caves marks 12 degrees, rises in the subterraneous caverns\r\nof the island of Madeira, near Funchal, to 16.2 degrees; in\r\nJoseph's Well, at Cairo* to 21.2 degrees (* At Funchal (latitude 32\r\ndegrees 37 minutes) the mean temperature of the air is 20.4\r\ndegrees, and at Cairo (latitude 30 degrees 2 minutes), according to\r\nNouet, it is 22.4 degrees.); in the grottoes of the island of Cuba\r\nto 22 or 23 degrees.* (* The mean temperature of the air at the\r\nHavannah, according to Mr. Ferrer, is 25.6 degrees.) This increase\r\nis nearly in proportion to that of the mean temperature of the\r\natmosphere, from latitude 48 degrees to the tropics.\r\n\r\nWe have just seen that, in the Cueva del Guacharo, the water of the\r\nriver is nearly 2 degrees colder than the ambient air of the\r\ncavern. The water, whether in filtering through the rocks, or in\r\nrunning over stony beds, doubtless imbibes the temperature of these\r\nbeds. The air contained in the grotto, on the contrary, is not in\r\nrepose; it communicates with the external atmosphere. Though under\r\nthe torrid zone, the changes of the external temperature are\r\nexceedingly trifling, currents are formed, which modify\r\nperiodically the internal air. It is consequently the temperature\r\nof the waters, that of 16.8 degrees, which we might look upon as\r\nthe temperature of the earth in those mountains, if we were sure\r\nthat the waters do not descend rapidly from more elevated\r\nneighbouring mountains.\r\n\r\nIt follows from these observations, that when we cannot obtain\r\nresults perfectly exact, we find at least under each zone certain\r\nnumbers which indicate the maximum and minimum. At Caripe, in the\r\nequinoctial zone, at an elevation of 500 toises, the mean\r\ntemperature of the globe is not below 16.8 degrees, which was the\r\ndegree indicated by the water of the subterranean river. We can\r\neven prove that this temperature of the globe is not above 19\r\ndegrees, since the air of the cavern, in the month of September,\r\nwas found to be at 18.7 degrees. As the mean temperature of the\r\natmosphere, in the hottest month, does not exceed 19.5 degrees,* it\r\nis probable that a thermometer in the grotto would not rise higher\r\nthan 19 degrees at any season of the year. (* The mean temperature\r\nof the month of September at Caripe is 18.5 degrees; and on the\r\ncoast of Cumana, where we had opportunities of making numerous\r\nobservations, the mean heat of the warmest months differs only 1.8\r\ndegrees from that of the coldest.)\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.8.\r\n\r\nDEPARTURE FROM CARIPE.\r\nMOUNTAIN AND FOREST OF SANTA MARIA.\r\nMISSION OF CATUARO.\r\nPORT OF CARIACO.\r\n\r\nThe days we passed at the Capuchin convent in the mountains of\r\nCaripe, glided swiftly away, though our manner of living was simple\r\nand uniform. From sunrise to nightfall we traversed the forests and\r\nneighbouring mountains, to collect plants. When the winter rains\r\nprevented us from undertaking distant excursions, we visited the\r\nhuts of the Indians, the conuco of the community, or those\r\nassemblies in which the alcaldes every evening arrange the labours\r\nof the succeeding day. We returned to the monastery only when the\r\nsound of the bell called us to the refectory to share the repasts\r\nof the missionaries. Sometimes, very early in the morning, we\r\nfollowed them to the church, to attend the doctrina, that is to\r\nsay, the religious instruction of the Indians. It was rather a\r\ndifficult task to explain dogmas to the neophytes, especially those\r\nwho had but a very imperfect knowledge of the Spanish language. On\r\nthe other hand, the monks are as yet almost totally ignorant of the\r\nlanguage of the Chaymas; and the resemblance of sounds confuses the\r\npoor Indians and suggests to them the most whimsical ideas. Of this\r\nI may cite an example. I saw a missionary labouring earnestly to\r\nprove that infierno, hell, and invierno, winter, were not one and\r\nthe same thing; but as different as heat and cold. The Chaymas are\r\nacquainted with no other winter than the season of rains; and\r\nconsequently they imagined the Hell of the whites to be a place\r\nwhere the wicked are exposed to frequent showers. The missionary\r\nharangued to no purpose: it was impossible to efface the first\r\nimpression produced by the analogy between the two consonants. He\r\ncould not separate in the minds of the neophytes the ideas of rain\r\nand hell; invierno and infierno.\r\n\r\nAfter passing almost the whole day in the open air, we employed our\r\nevenings, at the convent, in making notes, drying our plants, and\r\nsketching those that appeared to form new genera. Unfortunately the\r\nmisty atmosphere of a valley, where the surrounding forests fill\r\nthe air with an enormous quantity of vapour, was unfavourable to\r\nastronomical observations. I spent a part of the nights waiting to\r\ntake advantage of the moment when some star should be visible\r\nbetween the clouds, near its passage over the meridian. I often\r\nshivered with cold, though the thermometer only sunk to 16 degrees,\r\nwhich is the temperature of the day in our climates towards the end\r\nof September. The instruments remained set up in the court of the\r\nconvent for several hours, yet I was almost always disappointed in\r\nmy expectations. Some good observations of Fomalhaut and of Deneb\r\nhave given 10 degrees 10 minutes 14 seconds as the latitude of\r\nCaripe; which proves that the position indicated in the maps of\r\nCaulin is 18 minutes wrong, and in that of Arrowsmith 14 minutes.\r\n\r\nObservations of corresponding altitudes of the sun having given me\r\nthe true time, within about 2 seconds, I was enabled to determine\r\nthe magnetic variation with precision, at noon. It was, on the 20th\r\nof September, 1799, 3 degrees 15 minutes 30 seconds north-east;\r\nconsequently 0 degrees 58 minutes 15 seconds less than at Cumana.\r\nIf we attend to the influence of the horary variations, which in\r\nthese countries do not in general exceed 8 minutes, we shall find,\r\nthat at considerable distances the variation changes less rapidly\r\nthan is usually supposed. The dip of the needle was 42.75 degrees,\r\ncentesimal division, and the number of oscillations, expressing the\r\nintensity of the magnetic forces, rose to 229 in ten minutes.\r\n\r\nThe vexation of seeing the stars disappear in a misty sky was the\r\nonly disappointment we felt in the valley of Caripe. The aspect of\r\nthis spot presents a character at once wild and tranquil, gloomy\r\nand attractive. In the solitude of these mountains we are perhaps\r\nless struck by the new impressions we receive at every step, than\r\nwith the marks of resemblance we trace in climates the most remote\r\nfrom each other. The hills by which the convent is backed, are\r\ncrowned with palm-trees and arborescent ferns. In the evenings,\r\nwhen the sky denotes rain, the air resounds with the monotonous\r\nhowling of the alouate apes, which resembles the distant sound of\r\nwind when it shakes the forest. Yet amid these strange sounds,\r\nthese wild forms of plants, and these prodigies of a new world,\r\nnature everywhere speaks to man in a voice familiar to him. The\r\nturf that overspreads the soil: the old moss and fern that cover\r\nthe roots of the trees; the torrents that gush down the sloping\r\nbanks of the calcareous rocks; in fine, the harmonious accordance\r\nof tints reflected by the waters, the verdure, and the sky;\r\neverything recalls to the traveller, sensations which he has\r\nalready felt.\r\n\r\nThe beauties of this mountain scenery so much engaged us, that we\r\nwere very tardy in observing the embarrassment felt by our kind\r\nentertainers the monks. They had but a slender provision of wine\r\nand wheaten bread; and although in those high regions both are\r\nconsidered as belonging merely to the luxuries of the table, yet we\r\nsaw with regret, that our hosts abstained from them on our account.\r\nOur portion of bread had already been diminished three-fourths, yet\r\nviolent rains still obliged us to delay our departure for two days.\r\nHow long did this delay appear! It made us dread the sound of the\r\nbell that summoned us to the refectory.\r\n\r\nWe departed at length on the 22nd of September, followed by four\r\nmules, laden with our instruments and plants. We had to descend the\r\nnorth-east slope of the calcareous Alps of New Andalusia, which we\r\nhave called the great chain of the Brigantine and the Cocollar. The\r\nmean elevation of this chain scarcely exceeds six or seven hundred\r\ntoises: in respect to height and geological constitution, we may\r\ncompare it to the chain of the Jura. Notwithstanding the\r\ninconsiderable elevation of the mountains of Cumana, the descent is\r\nextremely difficult and dangerous in the direction of Cariaco. The\r\nCerro of Santa Maria, which the missionaries ascend in their\r\njourney from Cumana to their convent at Caripe, is famous for the\r\ndifficulties it presents to travellers. On comparing these\r\nmountains with the Andes of Peru, the Pyrenees, and the Alps, which\r\nwe successively visited, it has more than once occurred to us, that\r\nthe less lofty summits are sometimes the most inaccessible.\r\n\r\nOn leaving the valley of Caripe, we first crossed a ridge of hills\r\nnorth-east of the convent. The road led us along a continual ascent\r\nthrough a vast savannah, as far as the table-land of Guardia de San\r\nAugustin. We there halted to wait for the Indian who carried the\r\nbarometer. We found ourselves to be at 533 toises of absolute\r\nelevation, or a little higher than the bottom of the cavern of\r\nGuacharo. The savannahs or natural meadows, which yield excellent\r\npasture for the cows of the convent, are totally devoid of trees or\r\nshrubs. It is the domain of the monocotyledonous plants; for amidst\r\nthe gramina only a few Maguey* plants rise here and there (* Agave\r\nAmericana.); their flowery stalks being more than twenty-six feet\r\nhigh. Having reached the table-land of Guardia, we appeared to be\r\ntransported to the bed of an old lake, levelled by the\r\nlong-continued abode of the waters. We seemed to trace the\r\nsinuosities of the ancient shore in the tongues of land which jut\r\nout from the craggy rock, and even in the distribution of the\r\nvegetation. The bottom of the basin is a savannah, while its banks\r\nare covered with trees of full growth. This is probably the most\r\nelevated valley in the provinces of Venezuela and Cumana. One\r\ncannot but regret, that a spot favoured by so temperate a climate,\r\nand which without doubt would be fit for the culture of corn, is\r\ntotally uninhabited.\r\n\r\nFrom the table-land of Guardia we continued to descend, till we\r\nreached the Indian village of Santa Cruz. We passed at first along\r\na slope extremely slippery and steep, to which the missionaries had\r\ngiven the name of Baxada del Purgatorio, or Descent of Purgatory.\r\nIt is a rock of schistose sandstone, decomposed, covered with clay,\r\nthe talus of which appears frightfully steep, from the effect of a\r\nvery common optical illusion. When we look down from the top to the\r\nbottom of the hill the road seems inclined more than 60 degrees.\r\nThe mules in going down draw their hind legs near to their fore\r\nlegs, and lowering their cruppers, let themselves slide at a\r\nventure. The rider runs no risk, provided he slacken the bridle,\r\nthereby leaving the animal quite free in his movements. From this\r\npoint we perceived towards the left the great pyramid of Guacharo.\r\nThe appearance of this calcareous peak is very picturesque, but we\r\nsoon lost sight of it, on entering the thick forest, known by the\r\nname of the Montana de Santa Maria. We descended without\r\nintermission for seven hours. It is difficult to conceive a more\r\ntremendous descent; it is absolutely a road of steps, a kind of\r\nravine, in which, during the rainy season, impetuous torrents dash\r\nfrom rock to rock. The steps are from two to three feet high, and\r\nthe beasts of burden, after measuring with their eyes the space\r\nnecessary to let their load pass between the trunks of the trees,\r\nleap from one rock to another. Afraid of missing their mark, we saw\r\nthem stop a few minutes to scan the ground, and bring together\r\ntheir four feet like wild goats. If the animal does not reach the\r\nnearest block of stone, he sinks half his depth into the soft\r\nochreous clay, that fills up the interstices of the rock. When the\r\nblocks are wanting, enormous roots serve as supports for the feet\r\nof men and beasts. Some of these roots are twenty inches thick, and\r\nthey often branch out from the trunks of the trees much above the\r\nlevel of the soil. The Creoles have sufficient confidence in the\r\naddress and instinct of the mules, to remain in their saddles\r\nduring this long and dangerous descent. Fearing fatigue less than\r\nthey did, and being accustomed to travel slowly for the purpose of\r\ngathering plants and examining the nature of the rocks, we\r\npreferred going down on foot; and, indeed, the care which our\r\nchronometers demanded, left us no liberty of choice.\r\n\r\nThe forest that covers the steep flank of the mountain of Santa\r\nMaria, is one of the thickest I ever saw. The trees are of\r\nstupendous height and size. Under their bushy, deep green foliage,\r\nthere reigns continually a kind of dim daylight, a peculiar sort of\r\nobscurity, of which our forests of pines, oaks, and beech-trees,\r\nconvey no idea. Notwithstanding its elevated temperature, it is\r\ndifficult to believe that the air can dissolve the quantity of\r\nwater exhaled from the surface of the soil, the foliage of the\r\ntrees, and their trunks: the latter are covered with a drapery of\r\norchideae, peperomia, and other succulent plants. With the aromatic\r\nodour of the flowers, the fruit, and even the wood, is mingled that\r\nwhich we perceive in autumn in misty weather. Here, as in the\r\nforests of the Orinoco, fixing our eyes on the top of the trees, we\r\ndiscerned streams of vapour, whenever a solar ray penetrated, and\r\ntraversed the dense atmosphere. Our guides pointed out to us among\r\nthose majestic trees, the height of which exceeded 120 or 130 feet,\r\nthe curucay of Terecen. It yields a whitish liquid, and very\r\nodoriferous resin, which was formerly employed by the Cumanagoto\r\nand Tagiri Indians, to perfume their idols. The young branches have\r\nan agreeable taste, though somewhat astringent. Next to the curucay\r\nand enormous trunks of hymenaea, (the diameter of which was more\r\nthan nine or ten feet), the trees which most excited our attention\r\nwere the dragon's blood (Croton sanguifluum), the purple-brown\r\njuice of which flows down a whitish bark; the calahuala fern,\r\ndifferent from that of Peru, but almost equally medicinal;* (* The\r\ncalahuala of Caripe is the Polypodium crassifolium; that of Peru,\r\nthe use of which has been so much extended by Messrs. Ruiz and\r\nPavon, comes from the Aspidium coriaceum, Willd. (Tectaria\r\ncalahuala, Cav.) In commerce the diaphoretic roots of the\r\nPolypodium crassifolium, and of the Acrostichum huascaro, are mixed\r\nwith those of the calahuala or Aspidium coriaceum.) and the\r\npalm-trees, irasse, macanilla, corozo, and praga.* (* Aiphanes\r\npraga.) The last yields a very savoury palm-cabbage, which we had\r\nsometimes eaten at the convent of Caripe. These palms with pinnated\r\nand thorny leaves formed a pleasing contrast to the fern-trees. One\r\nof the latter, the Cyathea speciosa,* grows to the height of more\r\nthan thirty-five feet, a prodigious size for plants of this family.\r\n(* Possibly a hemitelia of Robert Brown. The trunk alone is from 22\r\nto 24 feet long. This and the Cyathea excelsa of the Mauritius, are\r\nthe most majestic of all the fern-trees described by botanists. The\r\ntotal number of these gigantic cryptogamous plants amounts at\r\npresent to 25 species, that of the palm-trees to 80. With the\r\ncyathea grow, on the mountain of Santa Maria, Rhexia juniperina,\r\nChiococca racemosa, and Commelina spicata.) We discovered here, and\r\nin the valley of Caripe, five new kinds of arborescent ferns.* (*\r\nMeniscium arborescens, Aspidium caducum, A. rostratum, Cyathea\r\nvillosa, and C. speciosa.) In the time of Linnaeus, botanists knew\r\nno more than four on both continents.\r\n\r\nWe observed that the fern-trees are in general much more rare than\r\nthe palm-trees. Nature has confined them to temperate, moist, and\r\nshady places. They shun the direct rays of the sun, and while the\r\npumos, the corypha of the steppes and other palms of America,\r\nflourish on the barren and burning plains, these ferns with\r\narborescent trunks, which at a distance look like palm-trees,\r\npreserve the character and habits of cryptogamous plants. They love\r\nsolitary places, little light, moist, temperate and stagnant air.\r\nIf they sometimes descend towards the sea-coast, it is only under\r\ncover of a thick shade. The old trunks of the cyathea and the\r\nmeniscium are covered with a carbonaceous powder, which, probably\r\nbeing deprived of hydrogen, has a metallic lustre like plumbago. No\r\nother plant presents this phenomenon; for the trunks of the\r\ndicotyledons, in spite of the heat of the climate, and the\r\nintensity of the light, are less burnt within the tropics than in\r\nthe temperate zone. It may be said that the trunks of the ferns,\r\nwhich, like the monocotyledons, are enlarged by the remains of the\r\npetioles, decay from the circumference to the centre; and that,\r\ndeprived of the cortical organs through which the elaborated juices\r\ndescend to the roots, they are burnt more easily by the action of\r\nthe oxygen of the atmosphere. I brought to Europe some powders with\r\nmetallic lustre, taken from very old trunks of Meniscium and\r\nAspidium.\r\n\r\nIn proportion as we descended the mountain of Santa Maria, we saw\r\nthe arborescent ferns diminish, and the number of palm-trees\r\nincrease. The beautiful large-winged butterflies (nymphales), which\r\nfly at a prodigious height, became more common. Everything denoted\r\nour approach to the coast, and to a zone in which the mean\r\ntemperature of the day is from 28 to 30 degrees.\r\n\r\nThe weather was cloudy, and led us to fear one of those heavy\r\nrains, during which from 1 to 1.3 inches of water sometimes falls\r\nin a day. The sun at times illumined the tops of the trees; and,\r\nthough sheltered from its rays, we felt an oppressive heat. Thunder\r\nrolled at a distance; the clouds seemed suspended on the top of the\r\nlofty mountains of the Guacharo; and the plaintive howling of the\r\naraguatoes, which we had so often heard at Caripe, denoted the\r\nproximity of the storm. We now for the first time had a near view\r\nof these howling apes. They are of the family of the alouates,* (*\r\nStentor, Geoffroy.) the different species of which have long been\r\nconfounded one with another. The small sapajous of America, which\r\nimitate in whistling the tones of the passeres, have the bone of\r\nthe tongue thin and simple, but the apes of large size, as the\r\nalouates and marimondes,* (* Ateles, Geoffroy.) have the tongue\r\nplaced on a large bony drum. Their superior larynx has six pouches,\r\nin which the voice loses itself; and two of which, shaped like\r\npigeons' nests, resemble the inferior larynx of birds. The air\r\ndriven with force into the bony drum produces that mournful sound\r\nwhich characterises the araguatoes. I sketched on the spot these\r\norgans, which are imperfectly known to anatomists, and published\r\nthe description of them on my return to Europe.\r\n\r\nThe araguato, which the Tamanac Indians call aravata,* (* In the\r\nwritings of the early Spanish missionaries, this monkey is\r\ndescribed by the names of aranata and araguato. In both names we\r\neasily discover the same root. The v has been transformed into g\r\nand n. The name of arabata, which Gumilla gives to the howling apes\r\nof the Lower Orinoco, and which Geoffroy thinks belongs to the S.\r\nstraminea of Great Paria, is the same Tamanac word aravata. This\r\nidentity of names need not surprise us. The language of the Chayma\r\nIndians of Cumana is one of the numerous branches of the Tamanac\r\nlanguage, and the latter is connected with the Caribbee language of\r\nthe Lower Orinoco.) and the Maypures marave, resembles a young\r\nbear.* (* Alouate ourse (Simia ursina).) It is three feet long,\r\nreckoning from the top of the head (which is small and very\r\npyramidal) to the beginning of the prehensile tail. Its fur is\r\nbushy, and of a reddish brown; the breast and belly are covered\r\nwith fine hair, and not bare as in the mono colorado, or alouate\r\nroux of Buffon, which we carefully examined in going from\r\nCarthagena to Santa Fe de Bogota. The face of the araguato is of a\r\nblackish blue, and is covered with a fine and wrinkled skin: its\r\nbeard is pretty long; and, notwithstanding the direction of the\r\nfacial line, the angle of which is only thirty degrees, the\r\naraguato has, in the expression of the countenance, as much\r\nresemblance to man as the marimonde (S. belzebuth, Bresson) and the\r\ncapuchin of the Orinoco (S. chiropotes). Among thousands of\r\naraguatoes which we observed in the provinces of Cumana, Caracas,\r\nand Guiana, we never saw any change in the reddish brown fur of the\r\nback and shoulders, whether we examined individuals or whole\r\ntroops. It appeared to me in general, that variety of colour is\r\nless frequent among monkeys than naturalists suppose.\r\n\r\nThe araguato of Caripe is a new species of the genus Stentor, which\r\nI have above described. It differs equally from the ouarine (S.\r\nguariba) and the alouate roux (S. seniculus, old man of the woods).\r\nIts eye, voice, and gait, denote melancholy. I have seen young\r\naraguatoes brought up in Indian huts. They never play like the\r\nlittle sagoins, and their gravity was described with much\r\nsimplicity by Lopez de Gomara, in the beginning of the sixteenth\r\ncentury. \"The Aranata de los Cumaneses,\" says this author, \"has the\r\nface of a man, the beard of a goat, and a grave demeanour (honrado\r\ngesto.)\" Monkeys are more melancholy in proportion as they have\r\nmore resemblance to man. Their sprightliness diminishes, as their\r\nintellectual faculties appear to increase.\r\n\r\nWe stopped to observe some howling monkeys, which, to the number of\r\nthirty or forty, crossed the road, passing in a file from one tree\r\nto another over the horizontal and intersecting branches. While we\r\nwere observing their movements, we saw a troop of Indians going\r\ntowards the mountains of Caripe. They were without clothing, as the\r\nnatives of this country generally are. The women, laden with rather\r\nheavy burdens, closed the march. The men were all armed; and even\r\nthe youngest boys had bows and arrows. They moved on in silence,\r\nwith their eyes fixed on the ground. We endeavoured to learn from\r\nthem whether we were yet far from the Mission of Santa Cruz, where\r\nwe intended passing the night. We were overcome with fatigue, and\r\nsuffered from thirst. The heat increased as the storm drew near,\r\nand we had not met with a single spring on the way. The words si,\r\npatre; no, patre; which the Indians continually repeated, led us to\r\nthink they understood a little Spanish. In the eyes of a native\r\nevery white man is a monk, a padre; for in the Missions the colour\r\nof the skin characterizes the monk, more than the colour of the\r\ngarment. In vain we questioned them respecting the length of the\r\nway: they answered, as if by chance, si and no, without our being\r\nable to attach any precise sense to their replies. This made us the\r\nmore impatient, as their smiles and gestures indicated their wish\r\nto direct us; and the forest seemed at every step to become thicker\r\nand thicker. At length we separated from the Indians; our guides\r\nwere able to follow us only at a distance, because the beasts of\r\nburden fell at every step in the ravines.\r\n\r\nAfter journeying for several hours, continually descending on\r\nblocks of scattered rock, we found ourselves unexpectedly at the\r\noutlet of the forest of Santa Maria. A savannah, the verdure of\r\nwhich had been renewed by the winter rains, stretched before us\r\nfarther than the eye could reach. On the left we discovered a\r\nnarrow valley, extending as far as the mountains of the Guacharo,\r\nand covered with a thick forest. Looking downward, the eye rested\r\non the tops of the trees, which, at eight hundred feet below the\r\nroad, formed a carpet of verdure of a dark and uniform tint. The\r\nopenings in the forest appeared like vast funnels, in which we\r\ncould distinguish by their elegant forms and pinnated leaves, the\r\nPraga and Irasse palms. But what renders this spot eminently\r\npicturesque, is the aspect of the Sierra del Guacharo. Its northern\r\nslope, in the direction of the gulf of Cariaco, is abrupt. It\r\npresents a wall of rock, an almost vertical profile, exceeding 3000\r\nfeet in height. The vegetation which covers this wall is so scanty,\r\nthat the eye can follow the lines of the calcareous strata. The\r\nsummit of the Sierra is flat, and it is only at its eastern\r\nextremity, that the majestic peak of the Guacharo rises like an\r\ninclined pyramid, its form resembles that of the needles and horns*\r\nof the Alps. (* The Shreckhorner, the Finsteraarhorn, etc.)\r\n\r\nThe savannah we crossed to the Indian village of Santa Cruz is\r\ncomposed of several smooth plateaux, lying above each other like\r\nterraces. This geological phenomenon, which is repeated in every\r\nclimate, seems to indicate a long abode of the waters in basins\r\nthat have poured them from one to the other. The calcareous rock is\r\nno longer visible, but is covered with a thick layer of mould. The\r\nlast time we saw it in the forest of Santa Maria it was slightly\r\nporous, and looked more like the limestone of Cumanacoa than that\r\nof Caripe. We there found brown iron-ore disseminated in patches,\r\nand if we were not deceived in our observation, a Cornu-ammonis,\r\nwhich we could not succeed in our attempt to detach. It was seven\r\ninches in diameter. This fact is the more important, as in this\r\npart of America we have never seen ammonites. The Mission of Santa\r\nCruz is situated in the midst of the plain. We reached it towards\r\nthe evening, suffering much from thirst, having travelled nearly\r\neight hours without finding water. The thermometer kept at 26\r\ndegrees; accordingly we were not more than 190 toises above the\r\nlevel of the sea.\r\n\r\nWe passed the night in one of those ajupas called King's houses,\r\nwhich, as I have already said, serve as tambos or caravanserais to\r\ntravellers. The rains prevented any observations of the stars; and\r\nthe next day, the 23rd of September, we continued our descent\r\ntowards the gulf of Cariaco. Beyond Santa Cruz a thick forest again\r\nappears; and in it we found, under tufts of melastomas, a beautiful\r\nfern, with osmundia leaves, which forms a new genus of the order of\r\npolypodiaceous plants.* (* Polybotya.)\r\n\r\nHaving reached the mission of Catuaro, we were desirous of\r\ncontinuing our journey eastward by Santa Rosalia, Casanay, San\r\nJosef, Carupano, Rio Carives, and the Montana of Paria; but we\r\nlearnt with great regret, that torrents of rain had rendered the\r\nroads impassable, and that we should run the risk of losing the\r\nplants we had already gathered. A rich planter of cacao-trees was\r\nto accompany us from Santa Rosalia to the port of Carupano; but\r\nwhen the time of departure approached, we were informed that his\r\naffairs had called him to Cumana. We resolved in consequence to\r\nembark at Cariaco, and to return directly by the gulf, instead of\r\npassing between the island of Margareta and the isthmus of Araya.\r\nThe Mission of Catuaro is situated on a very wild spot. Trees of\r\nfull growth still surround the church, and the tigers come by night\r\nto devour the poultry and swine belonging to the Indians. We lodged\r\nat the dwelling of the priest, a monk of the congregation of the\r\nObservance, to whom the Capuchins had confided the Mission, because\r\npriests of their own community were wanting.\r\n\r\nAt this Mission we met Don Alexandro Mexia, the corregidor of the\r\ndistrict, an amiable and well-educated man. He gave us three\r\nIndians, who, armed with their machetes, were to precede us, and\r\ncut our way through the forest. In this country, so little\r\nfrequented, the power of vegetation is such at the period of the\r\ngreat rains, that a man on horseback can with difficulty make his\r\nway through narrow paths, covered with lianas and intertwining\r\nbranches. To our great annoyance, the missionary of Catuaro\r\ninsisted on conducting us to Cariaco; and we could not decline the\r\nproposal. The movement for independence, which had nearly broken\r\nout at Caracas in 1798, had been preceded and followed by great\r\nagitation among the slaves at Coro, Maracaybo, and Cariaco. At the\r\nlast of these places an unfortunate negro had been condemned to\r\ndie, and our host, the vicar of Catuaro, was going thither to offer\r\nhim spiritual comfort. During our journey we could not escape\r\nconversations, in which the missionary pertinaciously insisted on\r\nthe necessity of the slave-trade, on the innate wickedness of the\r\nblacks, and the benefit they derived from their state of slavery\r\namong the Christians! The mildness of Spanish legislation, compared\r\nwith the Black Code of most other nations that have possessions in\r\neither of the Indies, cannot be denied. But such is the state of\r\nthe negroes, that justice, far from efficaciously protecting them\r\nduring their lives, cannot even punish acts of barbarity which\r\ncause their death.\r\n\r\nThe road we took across the forest of Catuaro resembled the descent\r\nof the mountain Santa Maria; here also, the most difficult and\r\ndangerous places have fanciful names. We walked as in a narrow\r\nfurrow, scooped out by torrents, and filled with fine tenacious\r\nclay. The mules lowered their cruppers and slid down the steepest\r\nslopes. This descent is called Saca Manteca.* (* Or the\r\nButter-Slope. Manteca in Spanish signifies butter.) There is no\r\ndanger in the descent, owing to the great address of the mules of\r\nthis country. The clay, which renders the soil so slippery, is\r\nproduced by the numerous layers of sandstone and schistose clay\r\ncrossing the bluish grey alpine limestone. This last disappears as\r\nwe draw nearer to Cariaco. When we reached the mountain of Meapira,\r\nwe found it formed in great part of a white limestone, filled with\r\nfossil remains, and from the grains of quartz agglutinated in the\r\nmass, it appeared to belong to the great formation of the sea-coast\r\nbreccias. We descended this mountain on the strata of the rock, the\r\nsection of which forms steps of unequal height. Farther on, going\r\nout of the forest, we reached the hill of Buenavista,* (* Mountain\r\nof the Fine Prospect.) well deserving the name it bears; since it\r\ncommands a view of the town of Cariaco, situated in the midst of a\r\nvast plain filled with plantations, huts, and scattered groups of\r\ncocoa-palms. To the west of Cariaco extends the wide gulf; which a\r\nwall of rock separates from the ocean: and towards the east are\r\nseen, like bluish clouds, the high mountains of Paria and Areo.\r\nThis is one of the most extensive and magnificent prospects that\r\ncan be enjoyed on the coast of New Andalusia. In the town of\r\nCariaco we found a great part of the inhabitants suffering from\r\nintermittent fever; a disease which in autumn assumes a formidable\r\ncharacter. When we consider the extreme fertility of the\r\nsurrounding plains, their moisture, and the mass of vegetation with\r\nwhich they are covered, we may easily conceive why, amidst so much\r\ndecomposition of organic matter, the inhabitants do not enjoy that\r\nsalubrity of air which characterizes the climate of Cumana.\r\n\r\nThe chain of calcareous mountains of the Brigantine and the\r\nCocollar sends off a considerable branch to the north, which joins\r\nthe primitive mountains of the coast. This branch bears the name of\r\nSierra de Meapire; but towards the town of Cariaco it is called\r\nCerro Grande de Curiaco. Its mean height did not appear to be more\r\nthan 150 or 200 toises. It was composed, where I could examine it,\r\nof the calcareous breccias of the sea-coast. Marly and calcareous\r\nbeds alternate with other beds containing grains of quartz. It is a\r\nvery striking phenomenon for those who study the physical aspect of\r\na country, to see a transverse ridge connect at right angles two\r\nparallel ridges, of which one, the more southern, is composed of\r\nsecondary rocks, and the other, the more northern, of primitive\r\nrocks. The latter presents, nearly as far as the meridian of\r\nCarupano, only mica-slate; but to the east of this point, where it\r\ncommunicates by a transverse ridge (the Sierra de Meapire) with the\r\nlimestone range, it contains lamellar gypsum, compact limestone,\r\nand other rocks of secondary formation. It might be supposed that\r\nthe southern ridge has transferred these rocks to the northern\r\nchain.\r\n\r\nWhen standing on the summit of the Cerro del Meapire, we see the\r\nmountain currents flow on one side to the gulf of Paria, and on the\r\nother to the gulf of Cariaco. East and west of the ridge there are\r\nlow and marshy grounds, spreading out without interruption; and if\r\nit be admitted that both gulfs owe their origin to the sinking of\r\nthe earth, and to rents caused by earthquakes, we must suppose that\r\nthe Cerro de Meapire has resisted the convulsive movements of the\r\nglobe, and hindered the waters of the gulf of Paria from uniting\r\nwith those of the gulf of Cariaco. But for this rocky dyke, the\r\nisthmus itself in all probability would have had no existence; and\r\nfrom the castle of Araya as far as Cape Paria, the whole mass of\r\nthe mountains of the coast would have formed a narrow island,\r\nparallel to the island of Santa Margareta, and four times as long.\r\nNot only do the inspection of the ground, and considerations\r\ndeduced from its relievo, confirm these opinions; but a mere glance\r\nof the configuration of the coasts, and a geological map of the\r\ncountry, would suggest the same ideas. It would appear that the\r\nisland of Margareta has been heretofore attached to the coast-chain\r\nof Araya by the peninsula of Chacopata and the Caribbee islands,\r\nLobo and Coche, in the same manner as this chain is still connected\r\nwith that of the Cocollar and Caripe by the ridge of Meapire.\r\n\r\nAt present we perceive that the humid plains which stretch east and\r\nwest of the ridge, and which are improperly called the valleys San\r\nBonifacio and Cariaco, are enlarging by gaining on the sea. The\r\nwaters are receding, and these changes of the shore are very\r\nremarkable, more particularly on the coast of Cumana. If the level\r\nof the soil seem to indicate that the two gulfs of Cariaco and\r\nParia formerly occupied a much more considerable space, we cannot\r\ndoubt that at present the land is progressively extending. Near\r\nCumana, a battery, called La Boca, was built in 1791 on the very\r\nmargin of the sea; in 1799 we saw it very far inland. At the mouth\r\nof the Rio Neveri, near the Morro of Nueva Barcelona, the retreat\r\nof the waters is still more rapid. This local phenomenon is\r\nprobably assignable to accumulations of sand, the progress of which\r\nhas not yet been sufficiently examined. Descending the Sierra de\r\nMeapire, which forms the isthmus between the plains of San\r\nBonifacio and Cariaco, we find towards the east the great lake of\r\nPutacuao, which communicates with the river Areo, and is four or\r\nfive leagues in diameter. The mountainous lands that surround this\r\nbasin are known only to the natives. There are found those great\r\nboa serpents known to the Chayma Indians by the name of guainas,\r\nand to which they fabulously attribute a sting under the tail.\r\nDescending the Sierra de Meapire to the west, we find at first a\r\nhollow ground (tierra hueca) which, during the great earthquakes of\r\n1766, threw out asphaltum enveloped in viscous petroleum. Farther\r\non, a numberless quantity of sulphureous thermal springs* are seen\r\nissuing from the soil (* El Llano de Aguas calientes,\r\neast-north-east of Cariaco, at the distance of two leagues.); and\r\nat length we reach the borders of the lake of Campoma, the\r\nexhalations from which contribute to the insalubrity of the climate\r\nof Cariaco. The natives believe that the hollow is formed by the\r\nengulfing of the hot springs; and, judging from the sound heard\r\nunder the hoofs of the horses, we must conclude that the\r\nsubterranean cavities are continued from west to east nearly as far\r\nas Casanay, a length of three or four thousand toises. A little\r\nriver, the Rio Azul, runs through these plains which are rent into\r\ncrevices by earthquakes. These earthquakes have a particular centre\r\nof action, and seldom extend as far as Cumana. The waters of the\r\nRio Azul are cold and limpid; they rise on the western declivity of\r\nthe mountain of Meapire, and it is believed that they are augmented\r\nby infiltrations from the lake Putacuao, situated on the other side\r\nof the chain. The little river, together with the sulphureous hot\r\nsprings, fall into the Laguna de Campoma. This is a name given to a\r\ngreat lagoon, which is divided in dry weather into three basins\r\nsituated north-west of the town of Cariaco, near the extremity of\r\nthe gulf. Fetid exhalations arise continually from the stagnant\r\nwater of this lagoon. The smell of sulphuretted hydrogen is mingled\r\nwith that of putrid fishes and rotting plants.\r\n\r\nMiasms are formed in the valley of Cariaco, as in the Campagna of\r\nRome; but the hot climate of the tropics increases their\r\ndeleterious energy. These miasms are probably ternary or quaternary\r\ncombinations of azote, phosphorus, hydrogen, carbon, and sulphur.\r\n\r\nThe situation of the lagoon of Campoma renders the north-west wind,\r\nwhich blows frequently after sunset, very pernicious to the\r\ninhabitants of the little town of Cariaco. Its influence can be the\r\nless doubted, as intermitting fevers are observed to degenerate\r\ninto typhoid fevers, in proportion as we approach the lagoon, which\r\nis the principal focus of putrid miasms. Whole families of free\r\nnegroes, who have small plantations on the northern coast of the\r\ngulf of Cariaco, languish in their hammocks from the beginning of\r\nthe rainy season. These intermittent fevers assume a dangerous\r\ncharacter, when persons, debilitated by long labour and copious\r\nperspiration, expose themselves to the fine rains, which frequently\r\nfall as evening advances. Nevertheless, the men of colour, and\r\nparticularly the Creole negroes, resist much better than any other\r\nrace, the influence of the climate. Lemonade and infusions of\r\nScoparia dulcis are given to the sick; but the cuspare, which is\r\nthe cinchona of Angostura, is seldom used.\r\n\r\nIt is generally observed, that in these epidemics of the town of\r\nCariaco the mortality is less considerable than might be supposed.\r\nIntermitting fevers, when they attack the same individual during\r\nseveral successive years, enfeeble the constitution; but this state\r\nof debility, so common on the unhealthy coasts, does not cause\r\ndeath. What is remarkable enough, is the belief which prevails here\r\nas in the Campagna of Rome, that the air has become progressively\r\nmore vitiated in proportion as a greater number of acres have been\r\ncultivated. The miasms exhaled from these plains have, however,\r\nnothing in common with those which arise from a forest when the\r\ntrees are cut down, and the sun heats a thick layer of dead leaves.\r\nNear Cariaco the country is but thinly wooded. Can it be supposed\r\nthat the mould, fresh stirred and moistened by rains, alters and\r\nvitiates the atmosphere more than the thick wood of plants which\r\ncovers an uncultivated soil? To local causes are joined other\r\ncauses less problematic. The neighbouring shores of the sea are\r\ncovered with mangroves, avicennias, and other shrubs with\r\nastringent bark. All the inhabitants of the tropics are aware of\r\nthe noxious exhalations of these plants; and they dread them the\r\nmore, as their roots and stocks are not always under water, but\r\nalternately wetted and exposed to the heat of the sun.* The\r\nmangroves produce miasms, because they contain vegeto-animal matter\r\ncombined with tannin. (* The following is a list of the social\r\nplants that cover those sandy plains on the sea-side, and\r\ncharacterize the vegetation of Cumana and the gulf of Cariaco.\r\nRhizophora mangle, Avicennia nitida, Gomphrena flava, G. brachiata,\r\nSesuvium portulacastrum (vidrio), Talinum cuspidatum (vicho), T.\r\ncumanense, Portulacca pilosa (zargasso), P. lanuginosa, Illecebrum\r\nmaritimum, Atriplex cristata, Heliotropium viride, H. latifolium,\r\nVerbena cuneata, Mollugo verticillata, Euphorbia maritima,\r\nConvolvulus cumanensis.)\r\n\r\nThe town of Cariaco has been repeatedly sacked in former times by\r\nthe Caribs. Its population has augmented rapidly since the\r\nprovincial authorities, in spite of prohibitory orders from the\r\ncourt of Madrid have often favoured the trade with foreign\r\ncolonies. The population amounted, in 1800, to more than 6000\r\nsouls. The inhabitants are active in the cultivation of cotton,\r\nwhich is of a very fine quality. The capsules of the cotton-tree,\r\nwhen separated from the woolly substance, are carefully burnt; as\r\nthose husks if thrown into the river, and exposed to putrefaction,\r\nyield noxious exhalations. The culture of the cacao-tree has of\r\nlate considerably diminished. This valuable tree bears only after\r\neight or ten years. Its fruit keeps very badly in the warehouses,\r\nand becomes mouldy at the expiration of a year, notwithstanding all\r\nthe precautions employed for drying it.\r\n\r\nIt is only in the interior of the province, to the east of the\r\nSierra de Meapire, that new plantations of the cacao-tree are seen.\r\nThey become there the more productive, as the lands, newly cleared\r\nand surrounded by forests, are in contact with an atmosphere damp,\r\nstagnant, and loaded with mephitic exhalations. We there see\r\nfathers of families, attached to the old habits of the colonists,\r\nslowly amass a little fortune for themselves and their children.\r\nThirty thousand cacao-trees will secure competence to a family for\r\na generation and a half. If the culture of cotton and coffee have\r\nled to the diminution of cacao in the province of Caracas and in\r\nthe small valley of Cariaco, it must be admitted that this last\r\nbranch of colonial industry has in general increased in the\r\ninterior of the provinces of New Barcelona and Cumana. The causes\r\nof the progressive movement of the cacao-tree from west to east may\r\nbe easily conceived. The province of Caracas has been from a remote\r\nperiod cultivated: and, in the torrid zone, in proportion as a\r\ncountry has been cleared, it becomes drier and more exposed to the\r\nwinds. These physical changes have been adverse to the propagation\r\nof cacao-trees, the plantations of which, diminishing in the\r\nprovince of Caracas, have accumulated eastward on a newly-cleared\r\nand virgin soil. The cacao of Cumana is infinitely superior to that\r\nof Guayaquil. The best is produced in the valley of San Bonifacio;\r\nas the best cacao of New Barcelona, Caracas, and Guatimala, is that\r\nof Capiriqual, Uritucu, and Soconusco. Since the island of Trinidad\r\nhas become an English colony, the whole of the eastern extremity of\r\nthe province of Cumana, especially the coast of Paria, and the gulf\r\nof the same name, have changed their appearance. Foreigners have\r\nsettled there, and have introduced the cultivation of the\r\ncoffee-tree, the cotton-tree, and the sugar-cane of Otaheite. The\r\npopulation has greatly increased at Carupano, in the beautiful\r\nvalley of Rio Caribe, at Guira, and at the new town of Punta di\r\nPiedra, built opposite Spanish Harbour, in the island of Trinidad.\r\nThe soil is so fertile in the Golfo Triste, that maize yields two\r\nharvests in the year, and produces three hundred and eighty fold\r\nthe quantity sown.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning we embarked in a sort of narrow canoe, called\r\na lancha, in hopes of crossing the gulf of Cariaco during the day.\r\nThe motion of the waters resembles that of our great lakes, when\r\nthey are agitated by the winds. From the embarcadero to Cumana the\r\ndistance is only twelve nautical leagues. On quitting the little\r\ntown of Cariaco, we proceeded westward along the river of\r\nCarenicuar, which, in a straight line like an artificial canal,\r\nruns through gardens and plantations of cotton-trees. On the banks\r\nof the river of Cariaco we saw the Indian women washing their linen\r\nwith the fruit of the parapara (Sapindus saponaria, or soap-berry),\r\nan operation said to be very injurious to the linen. The bark of\r\nthe fruit produces a strong lather; and the fruit is so elastic\r\nthat if thrown on a stone it rebounds three or four times to the\r\nheight of seven or eight feet. Being a spherical form, it is\r\nemployed in making rosaries.\r\n\r\nAfter we embarked we had to contend against contrary winds. The\r\nrain fell in torrents, and the thunder rolled very near. Swarms of\r\nflamingoes, egrets, and cormorants filled the air, seeking the\r\nshore, whilst the alcatras, a large species of pelican, alone\r\ncontinued peaceably to fish in the middle of the gulf. The gulf of\r\nCariaco is almost everywhere forty-five or fifty fathoms deep; but\r\nat its eastern extremity, near Curaguaca, along an extent of five\r\nleagues, the lead does not indicate more than three or four\r\nfathoms. Here is found the Baxo de la Cotua, a sand-bank, which at\r\nlow-water appears like a small island. The canoes which carry\r\nprovisions to Cumana sometimes ground on this bank; but always\r\nwithout danger, because the sea is never rough or heavy. We crossed\r\nthat part of the gulf where hot springs gush from the bottom of the\r\nsea. It was flood-tide, so that the change of temperature was not\r\nvery perceptible: besides, our canoe drove too much towards the\r\nsouthern shore. It may be supposed that strata of water must be\r\nfound of different temperatures, according to the greater or less\r\ndepth, and according as the mingling of the hot waters with those\r\nof the gulf is accelerated by the winds and currents. The existence\r\nof these hot springs, which we were assured raise the temperature\r\nof the sea through an extent of ten or twelve thousand square\r\ntoises, is a very remarkable phenomenon. (* In the island of\r\nGuadaloupe, there is a fountain of boiling water, which rushes out\r\non the beach. Hot-water springs rise from the bottom of the sea in\r\nthe gulf of Naples, and near the island of Palma, in the\r\narchipelago of the Canary Islands.) Proceeding from the promontory\r\nof Paria westward, by Irapa, Aguas Calientes, the gulf of Cariaco,\r\nthe Brigantine, and the valley of Aragua, as far as the snowy\r\nmountains of Merida, a continued band of thermal waters is found in\r\nan extent of 150 leagues.\r\n\r\nAdverse winds and rainy weather forced us to go on shore at\r\nPericantral, a small farm on the south side of the gulf. The whole\r\nof this coast, though covered with beautiful vegetation, is almost\r\nwholly uncultivated. There are scarcely seven hundred inhabitants:\r\nand, excepting in the village of Mariguitar, we saw only\r\nplantations of cocoa-trees, which are the olives of the country.\r\nThis palm occupies on both continents a zone, of which the mean\r\ntemperature of the year is not below 20 degrees.* (* The cocoa-tree\r\ngrows in the northern hemisphere from the equator to latitude 28\r\ndegrees. Near the equator we find it from the plains to the height\r\nof 700 toises above the level of the sea.) It is, like the\r\nchamaerops of the basin of the Mediterranean, a true palm-tree of\r\nthe coast. It prefers salt to fresh water; and flourishes less\r\ninland, where the air is not loaded with saline particles, than on\r\nthe shore. When cocoa-trees are planted in Terra Firma, or in the\r\nMissions of the Orinoco, at a distance from the sea, a considerable\r\nquantity of salt, sometimes as much as half a bushel, is thrown\r\ninto the hole which receives the nut. Among the plants cultivated\r\nby man, the sugar-cane, the plantain, the mammee-apple, and\r\nalligator-pear (Laurus persea), alone have the property of the\r\ncocoa-tree; that of being watered equally well with fresh and salt\r\nwater. This circumstance is favourable to their migrations; and if\r\nthe sugarcane of the sea-shore yield a syrup that is a little\r\nbrackish, it is believed at the same time to be better fitted for\r\nthe distillation of spirit than the juice produced from the canes\r\nin inland situations.\r\n\r\nThe cocoa-tree, in the other parts of America, is in general\r\ncultivated around farm-houses, and the fruit is eaten; in the gulf\r\nof Cariaco, it forms extensive plantations. In a fertile and moist\r\nground, the tree begins to bear fruit abundantly in the fourth\r\nyear; but in dry soils it bears only at the expiration of ten\r\nyears. The duration of the tree does not in general exceed eighty\r\nor a hundred years; and its mean height at that age is from seventy\r\nto eighty feet. This rapid growth is so much the more remarkable,\r\nas other palm-trees, for instance, the moriche,* (* Mauritia\r\nflexuosa.) and the palm of Sombrero,* (* Corypha tectorum.) the\r\nlongevity of which is very great, frequently do not attain a\r\ngreater height than fourteen or eighteen feet in the space of sixty\r\nyears. In the first thirty or forty years, a cocoa-tree of the gulf\r\nof Cariaco bears every lunation a cluster of ten or fourteen nuts,\r\nall of which, however, do not ripen. It may be reckoned that, on an\r\naverage, a tree produces annually a hundred nuts, which yield eight\r\nflascos* of oil. (One flasco contains 70 or 80 cubic inches, Paris\r\nmeasure.) In Provence, an olive-tree thirty years old yields twenty\r\npounds, or seven flascos of oil, so that it produces something less\r\nthan a cocoa-tree. There are in the gulf of Cariaco plantations\r\n(haciendas) of eight or nine thousand cocoa-trees. They resemble,\r\nin their picturesque appearance, those fine plantations of\r\ndate-trees near Elche, in Murcia, where, over the superficies of\r\none square league, there may be found upwards of 70,000 palms. The\r\ncocoa-tree bears fruit in abundance till it is thirty or forty\r\nyears old; after that age the produce diminishes, and a trunk a\r\nhundred years old, without being altogether barren, yields very\r\nlittle. In the town of Cumana there is prepared a great quantity of\r\ncocoa-nut oil, which is limpid, without smell, and very fit for\r\nburning. The trade in this oil is not less active than that on the\r\ncoast of Africa for palm-oil, which is obtained from the Elais\r\nguineensis, and is used as food. I have often seen canoes arrive at\r\nCumana laden with 3000 cocoa-nuts.\r\n\r\nWe did not quit the farm of Pericantral till after sunset. The\r\nsouth coast of the gulf presents a most fertile aspect, while the\r\nnorthern coast is naked, dry, and rocky. In spite of this aridity,\r\nand the scarcity of rain, of which sometimes none falls for the\r\nspace of fifteen months,* the peninsula of Araya, like the desert\r\nof Canound in India, produces patillas, or water-melons, weighing\r\nfrom fifty to seventy pounds. (* The rains appear to have been more\r\nfrequent at the beginning of the 16th century. At any rate, the\r\ncanon of Granada (Peter Martyr d'Anghiera), speaking in the year\r\n1574, of the salt-works of Araya, or of Haraia, described in the\r\nfifth chapter of this work, mentions showers (cadentes imbres) as a\r\nvery common phenomenon. The same author, who died in 1526, affirms\r\nthat the Indians wrought the salt-works before the arrival of the\r\nSpaniards. They dried the salt in the form of bricks; and our\r\nwriter even then discussed the geological question, whether the\r\nclayey soil of Haraia contained salt-springs, or whether it had\r\nbeen impregnated with salt by the periodical inundations of the\r\nocean for ages.) In the torrid zone, the vapours contained by the\r\nair form about nine-tenths of the quantity necessary to its\r\nsaturation: and vegetation is maintained by the property which the\r\nleaves possess of attracting the water dissolved in the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nAt sunrise, we saw the Zamuro vultures,* (* Vultur aura.) in flocks\r\nof forty or fifty, perched on the cocoa-trees. These birds range\r\nthemselves in files to roost together like fowls. They go to roost\r\nlong before sunset, and do not awake till after the sun is above\r\nthe horizon. This sluggishness seems as if it were shared in those\r\nclimates by the trees with pinnate leaves. The mimosas and the\r\ntamarinds close their leaves, in a clear and serene sky,\r\ntwenty-five or thirty-five minutes before sunset, and unfold them\r\nin the morning when the solar disk has been visible for an equal\r\nspace of time. As I noticed pretty regularly the rising and setting\r\nof the sun, for the purpose of observing the effect of the mirage,\r\nor of the terrestrial refractions, I was enabled to give continued\r\nattention to the phenomena of the sleep of plants. I found them the\r\nsame in the steppes, where no irregularity of the ground\r\ninterrupted the view of the horizon. It appears, that, accustomed\r\nduring the day to an extreme brilliancy of light, the sensitive and\r\nother leguminous plants with thin and delicate leaves are affected\r\nin the evening by the smallest decline in the intensity of the\r\nsun's rays; so that for vegetation, night begins there, as with us,\r\nbefore the total disappearance of the solar disk. But why, in a\r\nzone where there is scarcely any twilight, do not the first rays of\r\nthe sun stimulate the leaves with the more strength, as the absence\r\nof light must have rendered them more susceptible? Does the\r\nhumidity deposited on the parenchyma by the cooling of the leaves,\r\nwhich is the effect of the nocturnal radiation, prevent the action\r\nof the first rays of the sun? In our climates, the leguminous\r\nplants with irritable leaves awake during the twilight of the\r\nmorning, before the sun appears.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.9.\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL CONSTITUTION AND MANNERS OF THE CHAYMAS.\r\nTHEIR LANGUAGE.\r\nFILIATION OF THE NATIONS WHICH INHABIT NEW ANDALUCIA.\r\nPARIAGOTOS SEEN BY COLUMBUS.\r\n\r\nI did not wish to mingle with the narrative of our journey to the\r\nMissions of Caripe any general considerations on the different\r\ntribes of the indigenous inhabitants of New Andalusia; their\r\nmanners, their languages, and their common origin. Having returned\r\nto the spot whence we set out, I shall now bring into one point of\r\nview these considerations which are so nearly connected with the\r\nhistory of the human race. As we advance into the interior of the\r\ncountry, these subjects will become even more interesting than the\r\nphenomena of the physical world. The north-east part of equinoctial\r\nAmerica, Terra Firma, and the banks of the Orinoco, resemble in\r\nrespect to the numerous races of people who inhabit them, the\r\ndefiles of the Caucasus, the mountains of Hindookho, at the\r\nnorthern extremity of Asia, beyond the Tungouses, and the Tartare\r\nsettled at the mouth of the Lena. The barbarism which prevails\r\nthroughout these different regions is perhaps less owing to a\r\nprimitive absence of all kind of civilization, than to the effects\r\nof long degradation; for most of the hordes which we designate\r\nunder the name of savages, are probably the descendants of nations\r\nhighly advanced in cultivation. How can we distinguish the\r\nprolonged infancy of the human race (if, indeed, it anywhere\r\nexists), from that state of moral degradation in which solitude,\r\nwant, compulsory misery, forced migration, or rigour of climate,\r\nobliterate even the traces of civilization? If everything connected\r\nwith the primitive state of man, and the first population of a\r\ncontinent, could from its nature belong to the domain of history,\r\nwe might appeal to the traditions of India. According to the\r\nopinion frequently expressed in the laws of Menou and in the\r\nRamajan, savages were regarded as tribes banished from civilized\r\nsociety, and driven into the forests. The word barbarian, which we\r\nhave borrowed from the Greeks and Romans, was possibly merely the\r\nproper name of one of those rude hordes.\r\n\r\nIn the New World, at the beginning of the conquest, the natives\r\nwere collected into large societies only on the ridge of the\r\nCordilleras and the coasts opposite to Asia. The plains, covered\r\nwith forests, and intersected by rivers; the immense savannahs,\r\nextending eastward, and bounding the horizon; were inhabited by\r\nwandering hordes, separated by differences of language and manners,\r\nand scattered like the remnants of a vast wreck. In the absence of\r\nall other monuments, we may endeavour, from the analogy of\r\nlanguages, and the study of the physical constitution of man, to\r\ngroup the different tribes, to follow the traces of their distant\r\nemigrations, and to discover some of those family features by which\r\nthe ancient unity of our species is manifested.\r\n\r\nIn the mountainous regions which we have just traversed,--in the\r\ntwo provinces of Cumana and New Barcelona, the natives, or\r\nprimitive inhabitants, still constitute about one-half of the\r\nscanty population. Their number may be reckoned at sixty thousand;\r\nof which twenty-four thousand inhabit New Andalusia. This number is\r\nvery considerable, when compared with that of the hunting nations\r\nof North America; but it appears small, when we consider those\r\nparts of New Spain in which agriculture has existed more than eight\r\ncenturies: for instance, the Intendencia of Oaxaca, which includes\r\nthe Mixteca and the Tzapoteca of the old Mexican empire. This\r\nIntendencia is one-third smaller than the two provinces of Cumana\r\nand Barcelona; yet it contains more than four hundred thousand\r\nnatives of pure copper-coloured race. The Indians of Cumana do not\r\nall live within the Missions. Some are dispersed in the\r\nneighbourhood of the towns, along the coasts, to which they are\r\nattracted by the fisheries, and some dwell in little farms on the\r\nplains or savannahs. The Missions of the Aragonese Capuchins which\r\nwe visited, alone contain fifteen thousand Indians, almost all of\r\nthe Chayma race. The villages, however, are less populous there\r\nthan in the province of Barcelona. Their average population is only\r\nbetween five or six hundred Indians; while more to the west, in the\r\nMissions of the Franciscans of Piritu, we find Indian villages\r\ncontaining two or three thousand inhabitants. In computing at sixty\r\nthousand the number of natives in the provinces of Cumana and\r\nBarcelona, I include only those who inhabit the mainland, and not\r\nthe Guayquerias of the island of Margareta, and the great mass of\r\nthe Guaraunos, who have preserved their independence in the islands\r\nformed by the Delta of the Orinoco. The number of these is\r\ngenerally reckoned at six or eight thousand; but this estimate\r\nappears to me to be exaggerated. Except a few families of Guaraunos\r\nwho roam occasionally in the marshy grounds, called Los Morichales,\r\nand between the Cano de Manamo and the Rio Guarapiche,\r\nconsequently, on the continent itself, there have not been for\r\nthese thirty years, any Indian savages in New Andalusia.\r\n\r\nI use with regret the word savage, because it implies a difference\r\nof cultivation between the reduced Indian, living in the Missions,\r\nand the free or independent Indian; a difference which is often\r\nbelied by fact. In the forests of South America there are tribes of\r\nnatives, peacefully united in villages, and who render obedience to\r\nchiefs.* (* These chiefs bear the designations of Pecannati, Apoto,\r\nor Sibierne.) They cultivate the plantain-tree, cassava, and\r\ncotton, on a tolerably extensive tract of ground, and they employ\r\nthe cotton for weaving hammocks. These people are scarcely more\r\nbarbarous than the naked Indians of the Missions, who have been\r\ntaught to make the sign of the cross. It is a common error in\r\nEurope, to look on all natives not reduced to a state of\r\nsubjection, as wanderers and hunters. Agriculture was practised on\r\nthe American continent long before the arrival of Europeans. It is\r\nstill practised between the Orinoco and the river Amazon, in lands\r\ncleared amidst the forests, places to which the missionaries have\r\nnever penetrated. It would be to imbibe false ideas respecting the\r\nactual condition of the nations of South America, to consider as\r\nsynonymous the denominations of 'Christian,' 'reduced,' and\r\n'civilized;' and those of 'pagan,' 'savage,' and 'independent.' The\r\nreduced Indian is often as little of a Christian as the independent\r\nIndian is of an idolater. Both, alike occupied by the wants of the\r\nmoment, betray a marked indifference for religious sentiments, and\r\na secret tendency to the worship of nature and her powers. This\r\nworship belongs to the earliest infancy of nations; it excludes\r\nidols, and recognises no other sacred places than grottoes,\r\nvalleys, and woods.\r\n\r\nIf the independent Indians have nearly disappeared for a century\r\npast northward of the Orinoco and the Apure, that is, from the\r\nSnowy Mountains of Merida to the promontory of Paria, it must not\r\nthence be concluded, that there are fewer natives at present in\r\nthose regions, than in the time of the bishop of Chiapa, Bartolomeo\r\nde las Casas. In my work on Mexico, I have shown that it is\r\nerroneous to regard as a general fact the destruction and\r\ndiminution of the Indians in the Spanish colonies. There still\r\nexist more than six millions of the copper-coloured race, in both\r\nAmericas; and, though numberless tribes and languages are either\r\nextinct, or confounded together, it is beyond a doubt that, within\r\nthe tropics, in that part of the New World where civilization has\r\npenetrated only since the time of Columbus, the number of natives\r\nhas considerably increased. Two of the Carib villages in the\r\nMissions of Piritu or of Carony, contain more families than four or\r\nfive of the settlements on the Orinoco. The state of society among\r\nthe Caribbees who have preserved their independence, at the sources\r\nof the Essequibo and to the south of the mountains of Pacaraimo,\r\nsufficiently proves how much, even among that fine race of men, the\r\npopulation of the Missions exceeds in number that of the free and\r\nconfederate Caribbees. Besides, the state of the savages of the\r\ntorrid zone is not like that of the savages of the Missouri. The\r\nlatter require a vast extent of country, because they live only by\r\nhunting; whilst the Indians of Spanish Guiana employ themselves in\r\ncultivating cassava and plantains. A very little ground suffices to\r\nsupply them with food. They do not dread the approach of the\r\nwhites, like the savages of the United States; who, being\r\nprogressively driven back behind the Alleghany mountains, the Ohio,\r\nand the Mississippi, lose their means of subsistence, in proportion\r\nas they find themselves reduced within narrow limits. Under the\r\ntemperate zone, whether in the provincias internas of Mexico, or in\r\nKentucky, the contact of European colonists has been fatal to the\r\nnatives, because that contact is immediate.\r\n\r\nThese causes have no existence in the greater part of South\r\nAmerica. Agriculture, within the tropics, does not require great\r\nextent of ground. The whites advance slowly. The religious orders\r\nhave founded their establishments between the domain of the\r\ncolonists and the territory of the free Indians. The Missions may\r\nbe considered as intermediary states. They have doubtless\r\nencroached on the liberty of the natives; but they have almost\r\neverywhere tended to the increase of population, which is\r\nincompatible with the restless life of the independent Indians. As\r\nthe missionaries advance towards the forests, and gain on the\r\nnatives, the white colonists in their turn seek to invade in the\r\nopposite direction the territory of the Missions. In this\r\nprotracted struggle, the secular arm continually tends to withdraw\r\nthe reduced Indian from the monastic hierarchy, and the\r\nmissionaries are gradually superseded by vicars. The whites, and\r\nthe castes of mixed blood, favoured by the corregidors, establish\r\nthemselves among the Indians. The Missions become Spanish villages,\r\nand the natives lose even the remembrance of their natural\r\nlanguage. Such is the progress of civilization from the coasts\r\ntoward the interior; a slow progress, retarded by the passions of\r\nman, but nevertheless sure and steady.\r\n\r\nThe provinces of New Andalusia and Barcelona, comprehended under\r\nthe name of Govierno de Cumana, at present include in their\r\npopulation more than fourteen tribes. Those in New Andalusia are\r\nthe Chaymas, Guayqueries, Pariagotos, Quaquas, Aruacas, Caribbees,\r\nand Guaraunos; in the province of Barcelona, Cumanagotos, Palenkas,\r\nCaribbees, Piritus, Tomuzas, Topocuares, Chacopatas, and Guarivas.\r\nNine or ten of these fifteen tribes consider themselves to be of\r\nraces entirely distinct. The exact number of the Guaraunos, who\r\nmake their huts on the trees at the mouth of the Orinoco, is\r\nunknown; the Guayqueries, in the suburbs of Cumana and in the\r\npeninsula of Araya, amount to two thousand. Among the other Indian\r\ntribes, the Chaymas of the mountains of Caripe, the Caribs of the\r\nsouthern savannahs of New Barcelona, and the Cumanagotos in the\r\nMissions of Piritu, are most numerous. Some families of Guaraunos\r\nhave been reduced and dwell in Missions on the left bank of the\r\nOrinoco, where the Delta begins. The languages of the Guaraunos and\r\nthat of the Caribs, of the Cumanagotos and of the Chaymas, are the\r\nmost general. They seem to belong to the same stock; and they\r\nexhibit in their grammatical forms those affinities, which, to use\r\na comparison taken from languages more known, connect the Greek,\r\nthe German, the Persian, and the Sanscrit.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these affinities, we must consider the Chaymas, the\r\nGuaraunos, the Caribbees, the Quaquas, the Aruacas or Arrawaks, and\r\nthe Cumanagotos, as different nations. I would not venture to\r\naffirm the same of the Guayqueries, the Pariagotos, the Piritus,\r\nthe Tomuzas, and the Chacopatas. The Guayquerias themselves admit\r\nthe analogy between their language and that of the Guaraunos. Both\r\nare a littoral race, like the Malays of the ancient continent. With\r\nrespect to the tribes who at present speak the Cumanagota,\r\nCaribbean, and Chayma tongues, it is difficult to decide on their\r\nfirst origin, and their relations with other nations formerly more\r\npowerful. The historians of the conquest, as well as the\r\necclesiastics who have described the progress of the Missions,\r\ncontinually confound, like the ancients, geographical denominations\r\nwith the names of races. They speak of Indians of Cumana and of the\r\ncoast of Paria, as if the proximity of abode proved the identity of\r\norigin. They most commonly even give to tribes the names of their\r\nchiefs, or of the mountains or valleys they inhabit. This\r\ncircumstance, by infinitely multiplying the number of tribes, gives\r\nan air of uncertainty to all that the monks relate respecting the\r\nheterogeneous elements of which the population of their Missions\r\nare composed. How can we now decide, whether the Tomuza and Piritu\r\nbe of different races, when both speak the Cumanagoto language,\r\nwhich is the prevailing tongue in the western part of the Govierno\r\nof Cumana; as the Caribbean and the Chayma are in the southern and\r\neastern parts. A great analogy of physical constitution increases\r\nthe difficulty of these inquiries. In the new continent a\r\nsurprising variety of languages is observed among nations of the\r\nsame origin, and which European travellers scarcely distinguish by\r\ntheir features; while in the old continent very different races of\r\nmen, the Laplanders, the Finlanders, and the Estonians, the\r\nGermanic nations and the Hindoos, the Persians and the Kurds, the\r\nTartar and Mongol tribes, speak languages, the mechanism and roots\r\nof which present the greatest analogy.\r\n\r\nThe Indians of the American Missions are all agriculturists.\r\nExcepting those who inhabit the high mountains, they all cultivate\r\nthe same plants; their huts are arranged in the same manner; their\r\ndays of labour, their work in the conuco of the community; their\r\nconnexions with the missionaries and the magistrates chosen from\r\namong themselves, are all subject to uniform regulations.\r\nNevertheless (and this fact is very remarkable in the history of\r\nnations), these analogous circumstances have not effaced the\r\nindividual features, or the shades of character which distinguish\r\nthe American tribes. We observe in the men of copper hue, a moral\r\ninflexibility, a steadfast perseverance in habits and manners,\r\nwhich, though modified in each tribe, characterise essentially the\r\nwhole race. These peculiarities are found in every region; from the\r\nequator to Hudson's Bay on the one hand, and to the Straits of\r\nMagellan on the other. They are connected with the physical\r\norganization of the natives, but they are powerfully favoured by\r\nthe monastic system.\r\n\r\nThere exist in the missions few villages in which the different\r\nfamilies do not belong to different tribes and speak different\r\nlanguages. Societies composed of elements thus heterogeneous are\r\ndifficult to govern. In general, the monks have united whole\r\nnations, or great portions of the same nations, in villages\r\nsituated near to each other. The natives see only those of their\r\nown tribe; for the want of communication, and the isolated state of\r\nthe people, are essential points in the policy of the missionaries.\r\nThe reduced Chaymas, Caribs, and Tamanacs, retain their natural\r\nphysiognomy, whilst they have preserved their languages. If the\r\nindividuality of man be in some sort reflected in his idioms, these\r\nin their turn re-act on his ideas and sentiments. It is this\r\nintimate connection between language, character, and physical\r\nconstitution, which maintains and perpetuates the diversity of\r\nnations; that unfailing source of life and motion in the\r\nintellectual world.\r\n\r\nThe missionaries may have prohibited the Indians from following\r\ncertain practices and observing certain ceremonies; they may have\r\nprevented them from painting their skin, from making incisions on\r\ntheir chins, noses and cheeks; they may have destroyed among the\r\ngreat mass of the people superstitious ideas, mysteriously\r\ntransmitted from father to son in certain families; but it has been\r\neasier for them to proscribe customs and efface remembrances, than\r\nto substitute new ideas in the place of the old ones.\r\n\r\nThe Indian of the Mission is secure of subsistence; and being\r\nreleased from continual struggles against hostile powers, from\r\nconflicts with the elements and man, he leads a more monotonous\r\nlife, less active, and less fitted to inspire energy of mind, than\r\nthe habits of the wild or independent Indian. He possesses that\r\nmildness of character which belongs to the love of repose; not that\r\nwhich arises from sensibility and the emotions of the soul. The\r\nsphere of his ideas is not enlarged, where, having no intercourse\r\nwith the whites, he remains a stranger to those objects with which\r\nEuropean civilization has enriched the New World. All his actions\r\nseem prompted by the wants of the moment. Taciturn, serious, and\r\nabsorbed in himself; he assumes a sedate and mysterious air. When a\r\nperson has resided but a short time in the Missions, and is but\r\nlittle familiarized with the aspect of the natives, he is led to\r\nmistake their indolence, and the torpid state of their faculties,\r\nfor the expression of melancholy, and a meditative turn of mind.\r\n\r\nI have dwelt on these features of the Indian character, and on the\r\ndifferent modifications which that character exhibits under the\r\ngovernment of the missionaries, with the view of rendering more\r\nintelligible the observations which form the subject of the present\r\nchapter. I shall begin by the nation of the Chaymas, of whom more\r\nthan fifteen thousand inhabit the Missions above noticed. The\r\nChayma nation, which Father Francisco of Pampeluna* began to reduce\r\nto subjection in the middle of the seventeenth century (* The name\r\nof this monk, celebrated for his intrepidity, is still revered in\r\nthe province. He sowed the first seeds of civilization among these\r\nmountains. He had long been captain of a ship; and before he became\r\na monk, was known by the name of Tiburtio Redin.), has the\r\nCumanagotos on the west, the Guaraunos on the east, and the\r\nCaribbees on the south. Their territory occupies a space along the\r\nelevated mountains of the Cocollar and the Guacharo, the banks of\r\nthe Guarapiche, of the Rio Colorado, of the Areo, and of the Cano\r\nde Caripe. According to a statistical survey made with great care\r\nby the father prefect, there were, in the Missions of the Aragonese\r\nCapuchins of Cumana, nineteen Mission villages, of which the oldest\r\nwas established in 1728, containing one thousand four hundred and\r\nsixty-five families, and six thousand four hundred and thirty-three\r\npersons: sixteen doctrina villages, of which the oldest dates from\r\n1660, containing one thousand seven hundred and sixty-six families,\r\nand eight thousand one hundred and seventy persons. These Missions\r\nsuffered greatly in 1681, 1697, and 1720, from the invasions of the\r\nCaribbees (then independent), who burnt whole villages. From 1730\r\nto 1736, the population was diminished by the ravages of the\r\nsmall-pox, a disease always more fatal to the copper-coloured\r\nIndians than to the whites. Many of the Guaraunos, who had been\r\nassembled together, fled back again to their native marshes.\r\nFourteen old Missions were deserted, and have not been rebuilt.\r\n\r\nThe Chaymas are in general short of stature and thick-set. Their\r\nshoulders are extremely broad, and their chests flat. Their limbs\r\nare well rounded, and fleshy. Their colour is the same as that of\r\nthe whole American race, from the cold table-lands of Quito and New\r\nGrenada to the burning plains of the Amazon. It is not changed by\r\nthe varied influence of climate; it is connected with organic\r\npeculiarities which for ages past have been unalterably transmitted\r\nfrom generation to generation. If the uniform tint of the skin be\r\nredder and more coppery towards the north, it is, on the contrary,\r\namong the Chaymas, of a dull brown inclining to tawny. The\r\ndenomination of copper-coloured men could never have originated in\r\nequinoctial America to designate the natives.\r\n\r\nThe expression of the countenance of the Chaymas, without being\r\nhard or stern, has something sedate and gloomy. The forehead is\r\nsmall, and but little prominent, and in several languages of these\r\ncountries, to express the beauty of a woman, they say that 'she is\r\nfat, and has a narrow forehead.' The eyes of the Chaymas are black,\r\ndeep-set, and very elongated: but they are neither so obliquely\r\nplaced, nor so small, as in the people of the Mongol race. The\r\ncorner of the eye is, however, raised up towards the temple; the\r\neyebrows are black, or dark brown, thin, and but little arched; the\r\neyelids are edged with very long eyelashes, and the habit of\r\ncasting them down, as if from lassitude, gives a soft expression to\r\nthe women, and makes the eye thus veiled appear less than it really\r\nis. Though the Chaymas, and in general all the natives of South\r\nAmerica and New Spain, resemble the Mongol race in the form of the\r\neye, in their high cheek-bones, their straight and smooth hair, and\r\nthe almost total absence of beard; yet they essentially differ from\r\nthem in the form of the nose. In the South Americans this feature\r\nis rather long, prominent through its whole length, and broad at\r\nthe nostrils, the openings of which are directed downward, as with\r\nall the nations of the Caucasian race. Their wide mouths, with lips\r\nbut little protuberant though broad, have generally an expression\r\nof good nature. The passage from the nose to the mouth is marked in\r\nboth sexes by two furrows, which run diverging from the nostrils\r\ntowards the corners of the mouth. The chin is extremely short and\r\nround; and the jaws are remarkable for strength and width.\r\n\r\nThough the Chaymas have fine white teeth, like all people who lead\r\na very simple life, they are, however, not so strong as those of\r\nthe Negroes. The habit of blackening the teeth, from the age of\r\nfifteen, by the juices of certain herbs* and caustic lime,\r\nattracted the attention of the earliest travellers; but the\r\npractice has now fallen quite into disuse. (* The early historians\r\nof the conquest state that the blackening of the teeth was effected\r\nby the leaves of a tree which the natives called hay, and which\r\nresembled the myrtle. Among nations very distant from each other,\r\nthe pimento bears a similar name; among the Haitians aji or ahi,\r\namong the Maypures of the Orinoco, ai. Some stimulant and aromatic\r\nplants, which mostly belonging to the genus capsicum, were\r\ndesignated by the same name.) Such have been the migrations of the\r\ndifferent tribes in these countries, particularly since the\r\nincursions of the Spaniards, who carried on the slave-trade, that\r\nit may be inferred the inhabitants of Paria visited by Christopher\r\nColumbus and by Ojeda, were not of the same race as the Chaymas. I\r\ndoubt much whether the custom of blackening the teeth was\r\noriginally suggested, as Gomara supposed, by absurd notions of\r\nbeauty, or was practised with the view of preventing the toothache.\r\n* This disorder is, however, almost unknown to the Indians; and the\r\nwhites suffer seldom from it in the Spanish colonies, at least in\r\nthe warm regions, where the temperature is so uniform. They are\r\nmore exposed to it on the back of the Cordilleras, at Santa Fe, and\r\nat Popayan. (* The tribes seen by the Spaniards on the coast of\r\nParia, probably observed the practice of stimulating the organs of\r\ntaste by caustic lime, as other races employed tobacco, the chimo,\r\nthe leaves of the coca, or the betel. This practice exists even in\r\nour days, but more towards the west, among the Guajiros, at the\r\nmouth of the Rio de la Hacha. These Indians, still savage, carry\r\nsmall shells, calcined and powdered, in the husk of a fruit, which\r\nserves them as a vessel for various purposes, suspended to their\r\ngirdle. The powder of the Guajiros is an article of commerce, as\r\nwas anciently, according to Gomara, that of the Indians of Paria.\r\nThe immoderate habit of smoking also makes the teeth yellow and\r\nblackens them; but would it be just to conclude from this fact,\r\nthat Europeans smoke because we think yellow teeth handsomer than\r\nwhite?)\r\n\r\nThe Chaymas, like almost all the native nations I have seen, have\r\nsmall, slender hands. Their feet are large, and their toes retain\r\nan extraordinary mobility. All the Chaymas have a sort of family\r\nlook; and this resemblance, so often observed by travellers, is the\r\nmore striking, as between the ages of twenty and fifty, difference\r\nof years is no way denoted by wrinkles of the skin, colour of the\r\nhair, or decrepitude of the body. On entering a hut, it is often\r\ndifficult among adult persons to distinguish the father from the\r\nson, and not to confound one generation with another. I attribute\r\nthis air of family resemblance to two different causes, the local\r\nsituation of the Indian tribes, and their inferior degree of\r\nintellectual culture. Savage nations are subdivided into an\r\ninfinity of tribes, which, bearing violent hatred one to another,\r\nform no intermarriages, even when their languages spring from the\r\nsame root, and when only a small arm of a river, or a group of\r\nhills, separates their habitations. The less numerous the tribes,\r\nthe more the intermarriages repeated for ages between the same\r\nfamilies tend to fix a certain similarity of conformation, an\r\norganic type, which may be called national. This type is preserved\r\nunder the system of the Missions, each Mission being formed by a\r\nsingle horde, and marriages being contracted only between the\r\ninhabitants of the same hamlet. Those ties of blood which unite\r\nalmost a whole nation, are indicated in a simple manner in the\r\nlanguage of the Indians born in the Missions, or by those who,\r\nafter having been taken from the woods, have learned Spanish. To\r\ndesignate the individuals who belong to the same tribe, they employ\r\nthe expression mis parientes, my relations.\r\n\r\nWith these causes, common to all isolated classes, and the effects\r\nof which are observable among the Jews of Europe, among the\r\ndifferent castes of India, and among mountain nations in general,\r\nare combined some other causes hitherto unnoticed. I have observed\r\nelsewhere, that it is intellectual culture which most contributes\r\nto diversify the features. Barbarous nations have a physiognomy of\r\ntribe or of horde, rather than individuality of look or features.\r\nThe savage and civilized man are like those animals of an\r\nindividual species, some of which roam in the forest, while others,\r\nassociated with mankind, share the benefits and evils which\r\naccompany civilization. Varieties of form and colour are frequent\r\nonly in domestic animals. How great is the difference, with respect\r\nto mobility of features and variety of physiognomy, between dogs\r\nwhich have again returned to the savage state in the New World, and\r\nthose whose slightest caprices are indulged in the houses of the\r\nopulent! Both in men and animals the emotions of the soul are\r\nreflected in the features; and the countenance acquires the habit\r\nof mobility, in proportion as the emotions of the mind are\r\nfrequent, varied, and durable. But the Indian of the Missions,\r\nbeing remote from all cultivation, influenced only by his physical\r\nwants, satisfying almost without difficulty his desires, in a\r\nfavoured climate, drags on a dull, monotonous life. The greatest\r\nequality prevails among the members of the same community; and this\r\nuniformity, this sameness of situation, is pictured on the features\r\nof the Indians.\r\n\r\nUnder the system of the monks, violent passions, such as resentment\r\nand anger, agitate the native more rarely than when he lives in the\r\nforest. When man in a savage state yields to sudden and impetuous\r\nemotions, his physiognomy, till then calm and unruffled, changes\r\ninstantly to convulsive contortions. His passion is transient in\r\nproportion to its violence. With the Indians of the Missions, as I\r\nhave often observed on the Orinoco, anger is less violent, less\r\nearnest, but of longer duration. Besides, in every condition of\r\nman, it is not the energetic or the transient outbreaks of the\r\npassions, which give expression to the features. It is rather that\r\nsensibility of the soul, which brings us continually into contact\r\nwith the external world, multiplies our sufferings and our\r\npleasures, and re-acts at once on the physiognomy, the manners, and\r\nthe language. If the variety and mobility of the features embellish\r\nthe domain of animated nature, we must admit also, that both\r\nincrease by civilization, without being solely produced by it. In\r\nthe great family of nations, no other race unites these advantages\r\nin so high a degree as the Caucasian or European. It is only in\r\nwhite men that the instantaneous penetration of the dermoidal\r\nsystem by the blood can produce that slight change of the colour of\r\nthe skin which adds so powerful an expression to the emotions of\r\nthe soul. \"How can those be trusted who know not how to blush?\"\r\nsays the European, in his dislike of the Negro and the Indian. We\r\nmust also admit, that immobility of features is not peculiar to\r\nevery race of men of dark complexion: it is much less marked in the\r\nAfrican than in the natives of America.\r\n\r\nThe Chaymas, like all savage people who dwell in excessively hot\r\nregions, have an insuperable aversion to clothing. The writers of\r\nthe middle ages inform us, that in the north of Europe, articles of\r\nclothing distributed by missionaries, greatly contributed to the\r\nconversion of the pagan. In the torrid zone, on the contrary, the\r\nnatives are ashamed (as they say) to be clothed; and flee to the\r\nwoods, when they are compelled to cover themselves. Among the\r\nChaymas, in spite of the remonstrances of the monks, men and women\r\nremain unclothed within their houses. When they go into the\r\nvillages they put on a kind of tunic of cotton, which scarcely\r\nreaches to the knees. The men's tunics have sleeves; but women, and\r\nyoung boys to the age of ten or twelve, have the arms, shoulders,\r\nand upper part of the breast uncovered. The tunic is so shaped,\r\nthat the fore-part is joined to the back by two narrow bands, which\r\ncross the shoulders. When we met the natives, out of the boundaries\r\nof the Mission, we saw them, especially in rainy weather, stripped\r\nof their clothes, and holding their shirts rolled up under their\r\narms. They preferred letting the rain fall on their bodies to\r\nwetting their clothes. The elder women hid themselves behind trees,\r\nand burst into loud fits of laughter when they saw us pass. The\r\nmissionaries complain that in general the young girls are not more\r\nalive to feelings of decency than the men. Ferdinand Columbus*\r\nrelates that, in 1498, his father found the women in the island of\r\nTrinidad without any clothing (* Life of the Adelantado:\r\nChurchill's Collection 1723. This Life, written after the year\r\n1537, from original notes in the handwriting of Christopher\r\nColumbus himself, is the most valuable record of the history of his\r\ndiscoveries. It exists only in the Italian and Spanish translations\r\nof Alphonso de Ulloa and Gonzales Barcia: for the original, carried\r\nto Venice in 1571 by the learned Fornari, has not been published,\r\nand is supposed to be lost. Napione della Patria di Colombo 1804.\r\nCancellieri sopra Christ. Colombo 1809. ); while the men wore the\r\nguayuco, which is rather a narrow bandage than an apron. At the\r\nsame period, on the coast of Paria, young girls were distinguished\r\nfrom married women, either, as Cardinal Bembo states, by being\r\nquite unclothed, or, according to Gomara, by the colour of the\r\nguayuco. This bandage, which is still in use among the Chaymas, and\r\nall the naked nations of the Orinoco, is only two or three inches\r\nbroad, and is tied on both sides to a string which encircles the\r\nwaist. Girls are often married at the age of twelve; and until they\r\nare nine years old, the missionaries allow them to go to church\r\nunclothed, that is to say, without a tunic. Among the Chaymas, as\r\nwell as in all the Spanish Missions and the Indian villages, a pair\r\nof drawers, a pair of shoes, or a hat, are objects of luxury\r\nunknown to the natives. An Indian servant, who had been with us\r\nduring our journey to Caripe and the Orinoco, and whom I brought to\r\nFrance, was so much struck, on landing, when he saw the ground\r\ntilled by a peasant with his hat on, that he thought himself in a\r\nmiserable country, where even the nobles (los mismos caballeros)\r\nfollowed the plough. The Chayma women are not handsome, according\r\nto the ideas we annex to beauty; yet the young girls have a look of\r\nsoftness and melancholy, contrasting agreeably with the expression\r\nof the mouth, which is somewhat harsh and wild. They wear their\r\nhair plaited in two long tresses; they do not paint their skin; and\r\nwear no other ornaments than necklaces and bracelets made of\r\nshells, birds' bones, and seeds. Both men and women are very\r\nmuscular, but at the same time fleshy and plump. I saw no person\r\nwho had any natural deformity; and I may say the same of thousands\r\nof Caribs, Muyscas, and Mexican and Peruvian Indians, whom we\r\nobserved during the course of five years. Bodily deformities, and\r\ndeviations from nature, are exceedingly rare among certain races of\r\nmen, especially those who have the epidermis highly coloured; but I\r\ncannot believe that they depend solely on the progress of\r\ncivilization, a luxurious life, or the corruption of morals. In\r\nEurope a deformed or very ugly girl marries, if she happen to have\r\na fortune, and the children often inherit the deformity of the\r\nmother. In the savage state, which is a state of equality, no\r\nconsideration can induce a man to unite himself to a deformed\r\nwoman, or one who is very unhealthy. Such a woman, if she resist\r\nthe accidents of a restless and troubled life, dies without\r\nchildren. We might be tempted to think, that savages all appear\r\nwell-made and vigorous, because feeble children die young for want\r\nof care, and only the strongest survive; but these causes cannot\r\noperate among the Indians of the Missions, whose manners are like\r\nthose of our peasants, or among the Mexicans of Cholula and\r\nTlascala, who enjoy wealth, transmitted to them by ancestors more\r\ncivilized than themselves. If, in every state of cultivation, the\r\ncopper-coloured race manifests the same inflexibility, the same\r\nresistance to deviation from a primitive type, are we not forced to\r\nadmit that this peculiarity belongs in great measure to hereditary\r\norganization, to that which constitutes the race? With\r\ncopper-coloured men, as with whites, luxury and effeminacy weaken\r\nthe physical constitution, and heretofore deformities were more\r\ncommon at Cuzco and Tenochtitlan. Among the Mexicans of the present\r\nday, who are all labourers, leading the most simple lives,\r\nMontezuma would not have found those dwarfs and humpbacks whom\r\nBernal Diaz saw waiting at his table when he dined.* (* Bernal Diaz\r\nHist. Verd. de la Nueva Espana 1630.) The custom of marrying very\r\nyoung, according to the testimony of the monks, is no way\r\ndetrimental to population. This precocious nubility depends on the\r\nrace, and not on the influence of a climate excessively warm. It is\r\nfound on the north-west coast of America, among the Esquimaux, and\r\nin Asia, among the Kamtschatdales, and the Koriaks, where girls of\r\nten years old are often mothers. It may appear astonishing, that\r\nthe time of gestation--the duration of pregnancy, never alters in a\r\nstate of health, in any race, or in any climate.\r\n\r\nThe Chaymas are almost without beard on the chin, like the\r\nTungouses, and other nations of the Mongol race. They pluck out the\r\nfew hairs which appear; but independently of that practice, most of\r\nthe natives would be nearly beardless.* (* Physiologists would\r\nnever have entertained any difference of opinion respecting the\r\nexistence of the beard among the Americans, if they had considered\r\nwhat the first historians of the Conquest have said on this\r\nsubject; for example, Pigafetta, in 1519, in his journal, preserved\r\nin the Ambrosian Library at Milan, and published (in 1800) by\r\nAmoretti; Benzoni Hist. del Mundo Nuovo 1572; Bembo Hist. Venet.\r\n1557.) I say most of them, because there are tribes which, as they\r\nappear distinct from the others, are more worthy of fixing our\r\nattention. Such are, in North America, the Chippewas visited by\r\nMackenzie, and the Yabipaees, near the Toltec ruins at Moqui, with\r\nbushy beards; in South America, the Patagonians and the Guaraunos.\r\nAmong these last are some who have hairs on the breast. When the\r\nChaymas, instead of extracting the little hair they have on the\r\nchin, attempt to shave themselves frequently, their beards grow. I\r\nhave seen this experiment tried with success by young Indians, who\r\nofficiated at mass, and who anxiously wished to resemble the\r\nCapuchin fathers, their missionaries and masters. The great mass of\r\nthe people, however, dislike the beard, no less than the Eastern\r\nnations hold it in reverence. This antipathy is derived from the\r\nsame source as the predilection for flat foreheads, which is\r\nevinced in so singular a manner in the statues of the Aztec heroes\r\nand divinities. Nations attach the idea of beauty to everything\r\nwhich particularly characterizes their own physical conformation,\r\ntheir national physiognomy.* (* Thus, in their finest statues, the\r\nGreeks exaggerated the form of the forehead, by elevating beyond\r\nproportion the facial line.) Hence it ensues that among a people to\r\nwhom Nature has given very little beard, a narrow forehead, and a\r\nbrownish red skin, every individual thinks himself handsome in\r\nproportion as his body is destitute of hair, his head flattened,\r\nand his skin besmeared with annatto, chica, or some other\r\ncopper-red colour.\r\n\r\nThe Chaymas lead a life of singular uniformity. They go to rest\r\nvery regularly at seven in the evening, and rise long before\r\ndaylight, at half-past four in the morning. Every Indian has a fire\r\nnear his hammock. The women are so chilly, that I have seen them\r\nshiver at church when the centigrade thermometer was not below 18\r\ndegrees. The huts of the Indians are extremely clean. Their\r\nhammocks, their reed mats, their pots for holding cassava and\r\nfermented maize, their bows and arrows, everything is arranged in\r\nthe greatest order. Men and women bathe every day; and being almost\r\nconstantly unclothed, they are exempted from that uncleanliness, of\r\nwhich the garments are the principal cause among the lower class of\r\npeople in cold countries. Besides a house in the village, they have\r\ngenerally, in their conucos, near some spring, or at the entrance\r\nof some solitary valley, a small hut, covered with the leaves of\r\nthe palm or plantain-tree. Though they live less commodiously in\r\nthe conuco, they love to retire thither as often as they can. The\r\nirresistible desire the Indians have to flee from society, and\r\nenter again on a nomad life, causes even young children sometimes\r\nto leave their parents, and wander four or five days in the\r\nforests, living on fruits, palm-cabbage, and roots. When travelling\r\nin the Missions, it is not uncommon to find whole villages almost\r\ndeserted, because the inhabitants are in their gardens, or in the\r\nforests (al monte). Among civilized nations, the passion for\r\nhunting arises perhaps in part from the same causes: the charm of\r\nsolitude, the innate desire of independence, the deep impression\r\nmade by Nature, whenever man finds himself in contact with her in\r\nsolitude.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the women among the Chaymas, like that in all\r\nsemi-barbarous nations, is a state of privation and suffering. The\r\nhardest labour devolves on them. When we saw the Chaymas return in\r\nthe evening from their gardens, the man carried nothing but the\r\nknife or hatchet (machete), with which he clears his way among the\r\nunderwood; whilst the woman, bending under a great load of\r\nplantains, carried one child in her arms, and sometimes two other\r\nchildren placed upon the load. Notwithstanding this inequality of\r\ncondition, the wives of the Indians of South America appear to be\r\nin general happier than those of the savages of the North. Between\r\nthe Alleghany mountains and the Mississippi, wherever the natives\r\ndo not live chiefly on the produce of the chase, the women\r\ncultivate maize, beans, and gourds; and the men take no share in\r\nthe labours of the field. In the torrid zone, hunting tribes are\r\nnot numerous, and in the Missions, the men work in the fields as\r\nwell as the women.\r\n\r\nNothing can exceed the difficulty experienced by the Indians in\r\nlearning Spanish, to which language they have an absolute aversion.\r\nWhilst living separate from the whites, they have no ambition to be\r\ncalled educated Indians, or, to borrow the phrase employed in the\r\nMissions, 'latinized Indians' (Indios muy latinos). Not only among\r\nthe Chaymas, but in all the very remote Missions which I afterwards\r\nvisited, I observed that the Indians experience vast difficulty in\r\narranging and expressing the most simple ideas in Spanish, even\r\nwhen they perfectly understand the meaning of the words and the\r\nturn of the phrases. When a European questions them concerning\r\nobjects which have surrounded them from their cradles, they seem to\r\nmanifest an imbecility exceeding that of infancy. The missionaries\r\nassert that this embarrassment is neither the effect of timidity\r\nnor of natural stupidity, but that it arises from the impediments\r\nthey meet with in the structure of a language so different from\r\ntheir native tongue. In proportion as man is remote from\r\ncultivation, the greater is his mental inaptitude. It is not,\r\ntherefore, surprising that the isolated Indians in the Missions\r\nshould experience in the acquisition of the Spanish language, less\r\nfacility than Indians who live among mestizoes, mulattoes, and\r\nwhites, in the neighbourhood of towns. Nevertheless, I have often\r\nwondered at the volubility with which, at Caripe, the native\r\nalcalde, the governador, and the sergento mayor, will harangue for\r\nwhole hours the Indians assembled before the church; regulating the\r\nlabours of the week, reprimanding the idle, or threatening the\r\ndisobedient. Those chiefs who are also of the Chayma race, and who\r\ntransmit the orders of the missionary, speak all together in a loud\r\nvoice, with marked emphasis, but almost without action. Their\r\nfeatures remain motionless; but their look is imperious and severe.\r\n\r\nThese same men, who manifest quickness of intellect, and who were\r\ntolerably well acquainted with the Spanish, were unable to connect\r\ntheir ideas, when, in our excursions in the country around the\r\nconvent, we put questions to them through the intervention of the\r\nmonks. They were made to affirm or deny whatever the monks pleased:\r\nand that wily civility, to which the least cultivated Indian is no\r\nstranger, induced them sometimes to give to their answers the turn\r\nthat seemed to be suggested by our questions. Travellers cannot be\r\nenough on their guard against this officious assent, when they seek\r\nto confirm their own opinions by the testimony of the natives. To\r\nput an Indian alcalde to the proof, I asked him one day, whether he\r\ndid not think the little river of Caripe, which issues from the\r\ncavern of the Guacharo, returned into it on the opposite side by\r\nsome unknown entrance, after having ascended the slope of the\r\nmountain. The Indian seemed gravely to reflect on the subject, and\r\nthen answered, by way of supporting my hypothesis: \"How else, if it\r\nwere not so, would there always be water in the bed of the river at\r\nthe mouth of the cavern?\"\r\n\r\nThe Chaymas are very dull in comprehending anything relating to\r\nnumerical facts. I never knew one of these people who might not\r\nhave been made to say that he was either eighteen or sixty years of\r\nage. Mr. Marsden observed the same peculiarity in the Malays of\r\nSumatra, though they have been civilized more than five centuries.\r\nThe Chayma language contains words which express pretty large\r\nnumbers, yet few Indians know how to apply them; and having felt,\r\nfrom their intercourse with the missionaries, the necessity of so\r\ndoing, the more intelligent among them count in Spanish, but\r\napparently with great effort of mind, as far as thirty, or perhaps\r\nfifty. The same persons, however, cannot count in the Chayma\r\nlanguage beyond five or six. It is natural that they should employ\r\nin preference the words of a language in which they have been\r\ntaught the series of units and tens. Since learned Europeans have\r\nnot disdained to study the structure of the idioms of America with\r\nthe same care as they study those of the Semitic languages, and of\r\nthe Greek and Latin, they no longer attribute to the imperfection\r\nof a language, what belongs to the rudeness of the nation. It is\r\nacknowledged, that almost everywhere the Indian idioms display\r\ngreater richness, and more delicate gradations, than might be\r\nsupposed from the uncultivated state of the people by whom they are\r\nspoken. I am far from placing the languages of the New World in the\r\nsame rank with the finest languages of Asia and Europe; but no one\r\nof these latter has a more neat, regular, and simple system of\r\nnumeration, than the Quichua and the Aztec, which were spoken in\r\nthe great empires of Cuzco and Anahuac. It is a mistake to suppose\r\nthat those languages do not admit of counting beyond four, because\r\nin villages where they are spoken by the poor labourers of Peruvian\r\nand Mexican race, individuals are found, who cannot count beyond\r\nthat number. The singular opinion, that so many American nations\r\nreckon only as far as five, ten, or twenty, has been propagated by\r\ntravellers, who have not reflected, that, according to the genius\r\nof different idioms, men of all nations stop at groups of five,\r\nten, or twenty units (that is, the number of the fingers of one\r\nhand, or of both hands, or of the fingers and toes together); and\r\nthat six, thirteen, or twenty are differently expressed, by\r\nfive-one, ten-three, and feet-ten.* (* Savages, to express great\r\nnumbers with more facility, are in the habit of forming groups of\r\nfive, ten, or twenty grains of maize, according as they reckon in\r\ntheir language by fives, tens, or twenties.) Can it be said that\r\nthe numbers of the Europeans do not extend beyond ten, because we\r\nstop after having formed a group of ten units?\r\n\r\nThe construction of the languages of America is so opposite to that\r\nof the languages derived from the Latin, that the Jesuits, who had\r\nthoroughly examined everything that could contribute to extend\r\ntheir establishments, introduced among their neophytes, instead of\r\nthe Spanish, some Indian tongues, remarkable for their regularity\r\nand copiousness, such as the Quichua and the Guarani. They\r\nendeavoured to substitute these languages for others which were\r\npoorer and more irregular in their syntax. This substitution was\r\nfound easy: the Indians of the different tribes adopted it with\r\ndocility, and thenceforward those American languages generalized\r\nbecame a ready medium of communication between the missionaries and\r\nthe neophytes. It would be a mistake to suppose, that the\r\npreference given to the language of the Incas over the Spanish\r\ntongue had no other aim than that of isolating the Missions, and\r\nwithdrawing them from the influence of two rival powers, the\r\nbishops and civil governors. The Jesuits had other motives,\r\nindependently of their policy, for wishing to generalize certain\r\nIndian tongues. They found in those languages a common tie, easy to\r\nbe established between the numerous hordes which had remained\r\nhostile to each other, and had been kept asunder by diversity of\r\nidioms; for, in uncultivated countries, after the lapse of several\r\nages, dialects often assume the form, or at least the appearance,\r\nof mother tongues.\r\n\r\nWhen it is said that a Dane learns the German, and a Spaniard the\r\nItalian or the Latin, more easily than they learn any other\r\nlanguage, it is at first thought that this facility results from\r\nthe identity of a great number of roots, common to all the Germanic\r\ntongues, or to those of Latin Europe; it is not considered, that,\r\nwith this resemblance of sounds, there is another resemblance,\r\nwhich acts more powerfully on nations of a common origin. Language\r\nis not the result of an arbitrary convention. The mechanism of\r\ninflections, the grammatical constructions, the possibility of\r\ninversions, all are the offspring of our own minds, of our\r\nindividual organization. There is in man an instinctive and\r\nregulating principle, differently modified among nations not of the\r\nsame race. A climate more or less severe, a residence in the\r\ndefiles of mountains, or on the sea-coasts, or different habits of\r\nlife, may alter the pronunciation, render the identity of the roots\r\nobscure, and multiply the number; but all these causes do not\r\naffect that which constitutes the structure and mechanism of\r\nlanguages. The influence of climate, and of external circumstances,\r\nvanishes before the influence which depends on the race, on the\r\nhereditary and individual dispositions of men.\r\n\r\nIn America (and this result of recent researches* (* See Vater's\r\nMithridates.) is extremely important with respect to the history of\r\nour species) from the country of the Esquimaux to the banks of the\r\nOrinoco, and again from these torrid regions to the frozen climate\r\nof the Straits of Magellan, mother-tongues, entirely different in\r\ntheir roots, have, if we may use the expression, the same\r\nphysiognomy. Striking analogies of grammatical construction are\r\nacknowledged, not only in the more perfect languages, as in that of\r\nthe Incas, the Aymara, the Guarauno, the Mexican, and the Cora, but\r\nalso in languages extremely rude. Idioms, the roots of which do not\r\nresemble each other more than the roots of the Sclavonic and the\r\nBiscayan, have those resemblances of internal mechanism which are\r\nfound in the Sanscrit, the Persian, the Greek, and the German\r\nlanguages. Almost everywhere in the New World we recognize a\r\nmultiplicity of forms and tenses in the verb,* (* In the Greenland\r\nlanguage, for example, the multiplicity of the pronouns governed by\r\nthe verb produces twenty-seven forms for every tense of the\r\nIndicative mood. It is surprising to find, among nations now\r\nranking in the lowest degree of civilization, this desire of\r\ngraduating the relations of time, this superabundance of\r\nmodifications introduced into the verb, to characterise the object.\r\nMatarpa, he takes it away: mattarpet, thou takest it away:\r\nmattarpatit, he takes it away from thee: mattarpagit, I take away\r\nfrom thee. And in the preterite of the same verb, mattara, he has\r\ntaken it away: mattaratit, he has taken it away from thee. This\r\nexample from the Greenland language shows how the governed and the\r\npersonal pronouns form one compound, in the American languages,\r\nwith the root of the verb. These slight differences in the form of\r\nthe verb, according to the nature of the pronouns governed by it,\r\nis found in the Old World only in the Biscayan and Congo languages\r\n(Vater, Mithridates. William von Humboldt, On the Basque Language).\r\nStrange conformity in the structure of languages on spots so\r\ndistant, and among three races of men so different,--the white\r\nCatalonians, the black Congos, and the copper-coloured Americans!)\r\nan ingenious method of indicating beforehand, either by inflexion\r\nof the personal pronouns, which form the terminations of the verb,\r\nor by an intercalated suffix, the nature and the relation of its\r\nobject and its subject, and of distinguishing whether the object be\r\nanimate or inanimate, of the masculine or the feminine gender,\r\nsimple or in complex number. It is on account of this general\r\nanalogy of structure,--it is because American languages which have\r\nno words in common (for instance, the Mexican and the Quichua),\r\nresemble each other by their organization, and form complete\r\ncontrasts to the languages of Latin Europe, that the Indians of the\r\nMissions familiarize themselves more easily with an American idiom\r\nthan with the Spanish. In the forests of the Orinoco I have seen\r\nthe rudest Indians speak two or three tongues. Savages of different\r\nnations often communicate their ideas to each other by an idiom not\r\ntheir own.\r\n\r\nIf the system of the Jesuits had been followed, languages, which\r\nalready occupy a vast extent of country, would have become almost\r\ngeneral. In Terra Firma and on the Orinoco, the Caribbean and the\r\nTamanac alone would now be spoken; and in the south and south-west,\r\nthe Quichua, the Guarano, the Omagua, and the Araucan. By\r\nappropriating to themselves these languages, the grammatical forms\r\nof which are very regular, and almost as fixed as those of the\r\nGreek and Sanscrit, the missionaries would place themselves in more\r\nintimate connection with the natives whom they govern. The\r\nnumberless difficulties which occur in the system of a Mission\r\nconsisting of Indians of ten or a dozen different nations would\r\ndisappear with the confusion of idioms. Those which are little\r\ndiffused would become dead languages; but the Indian, in preserving\r\nan American idiom, would retain his individuality--his national\r\ncharacter. Thus by peaceful means might be effected what the Incas\r\nbegan to establish by force of arms.\r\n\r\nHow indeed can we be surprised at the little progress made by the\r\nChaymas, the Caribbees, the Salives, or the Otomacs, in the\r\nknowledge of the Spanish language, when we recollect that one white\r\nman, one single missionary, finds himself alone amidst five or six\r\nhundred Indians? and that it is difficult for him to establish\r\namong them a governador, an alcalde, or a fiscal, who may serve him\r\nas an interpreter? If, instead of the missionary system, some other\r\nmeans of civilization were substituted, if, instead of keeping the\r\nwhites at a distance, they could be mingled with the natives\r\nrecently united in villages, the American idioms would soon be\r\nsuperseded by the languages of Europe, and the natives would\r\nreceive in those languages the great mass of new ideas which are\r\nthe fruit of civilization. Then the introduction of general\r\ntongues, such as that of the Incas, or the Guaranos, without doubt\r\nwould become useless. But after having lived so long in the\r\nMissions of South America, after having so closely observed the\r\nadvantages and the abuses of the system of the missionaries, I may\r\nbe permitted to doubt whether that system could be easily\r\nabandoned, though it is doubtless very capable of being improved,\r\nand rendered more conformable with our ideas of civil liberty. To\r\nthis it may be answered, that the Romans* succeeded in rapidly\r\nintroducing their language with their sovereignty into the country\r\nof the Gauls, into Boetica, and into the province of Africa. (* For\r\nthe reason of this rapid introduction of Latin among the Gauls, I\r\nbelieve we must look into the character of the natives and the\r\nstate of their civilization, and not into the structure of their\r\nlanguage. The brown-haired Celtic nations were certainly different\r\nfrom the race of the light-haired Germanic nations; and though the\r\nDruid caste recalls to our minds one of the institutions of the\r\nGanges, this does not demonstrate that the idiom of the Celts\r\nbelongs, like that of the nations of Odin, to a branch of the\r\nIndo-Pelasgic languages. From analogy of structure and of roots,\r\nthe Latin ought to have penetrated more easily on the other side of\r\nthe Danube, than into Gaul; but an uncultivated state, joined to\r\ngreat moral inflexibility, probably opposed its introduction among\r\nthe Germanic nations.) But the natives of these countries were not\r\nsavages;--they inhabited towns; they were acquainted with the use\r\nof money; and they possessed institutions denoting a tolerably\r\nadvanced state of cultivation. The allurement of commerce, and a\r\nlong abode of the Roman legions, had promoted intercourse between\r\nthem and their conquerors. We see, on the contrary, that the\r\nintroduction of the languages of the mother-countries was met by\r\nobstacles almost innumerable, wherever Carthaginian, Greek, or\r\nRoman colonies were established on coasts entirely barbarous. In\r\nevery age, and in every climate, the first impulse of the savage is\r\nto shun the civilized man.\r\n\r\nThe language of the Chayma Indians was less agreeable to my ear\r\nthan the Caribbee, the Salive, and other languages of the Orinoco.\r\nIt has fewer sonorous terminations in accented vowels. We are\r\nstruck with the frequent repetition of the syllables guaz, ez,\r\npuec, and pur. These terminations are derived in part from the\r\ninflexion of the verb to be, and from certain prepositions, which\r\nare added at the ends of words, and which, according to the genius\r\nof the American idioms, are incorporated with them. It would be\r\nwrong to attribute this harshness of sound to the abode of the\r\nChaymas in the mountains. They are strangers to that temperate\r\nclimate. They have been led thither by the missionaries; and it is\r\nwell known that, like all the inhabitants of warm regions, they at\r\nfirst dreaded what they called the cold of Caripe. I employed\r\nmyself, with M. Bonpland, during our abode at the hospital of the\r\nCapuchins, in forming a small catalogue of Chayma words. I am aware\r\nthat languages are much more strongly characterised by their\r\nstructure and grammatical forms than by the analogy of their sounds\r\nand of their roots; and that the analogy of sounds is sometimes so\r\ndisguised in different dialects of the same tongue, as not to be\r\nrecognizable; for the tribes into which a nation is divided, often\r\ndesignate the same objects by words altogether heterogeneous. Hence\r\nit follows that we readily fall into mistakes, if, neglecting the\r\nstudy of the inflexions, and consulting only the roots (for\r\ninstance, in the words which designate the moon, sky, water, and\r\nearth), we decide on the absolute difference of two idioms from the\r\nmere want of resemblance in sounds. But, while aware of this source\r\nof error, travellers would do well to continue to collect such\r\nmaterials as may be within their reach. If they do not make known\r\nthe internal structure, and general arrangement of the edifice,\r\nthey may point out some important parts.\r\n\r\nThe three languages now most used in the provinces of Cumana and\r\nBarcelona, are the Chayma, the Cumanagota, and the Caribbee. They\r\nhave always been regarded in these countries as different idioms,\r\nand a dictionary of each has been written for the use of the\r\nMissions, by Fathers Tauste, Ruiz-blanco, and Breton. The\r\nVocabulario y Arte de la Lengua de los Indios Chaymas has become\r\nextremely scarce. The few American grammars, printed for the most\r\npart in the seventeenth century, passed into the Missions, and have\r\nbeen lost in the forests. The dampness of the air and the voracity\r\nof insects* render the preservation of books almost impossible in\r\nthose regions (* The termites, so well known in Spanish America\r\nunder the name of comegen, or 'devourer,' is one of these\r\ndestructive insects.): they are destroyed in a short space of time,\r\nnotwithstanding every precaution that may be employed. I had much\r\ndifficulty to collect in the Missions, and in the convents, those\r\ngrammars of American languages, which, on my return to Europe, I\r\nplaced in the hands of Severin Vater, professor and librarian at\r\nthe university of Konigsberg. They furnished him with useful\r\nmaterials for his great work on the idioms of the New World. I\r\nomitted, at the time, to transcribe from my journal, and\r\ncommunicate to that learned gentleman, what I had collected in the\r\nChayma tongue. Since neither Father Gili, nor the Abbe Hervas, has\r\nmentioned this language, I shall here explain succinctly the result\r\nof my researches.\r\n\r\nOn the right bank of the Orinoco, south-east of the Mission of\r\nEncaramada, and at the distance of more than a hundred leagues from\r\nthe Chaymas, live the Tamanacs (Tamanacu), whose language is\r\ndivided into several dialects. This nation, formerly very powerful,\r\nis separated from the mountains of Caripe by the Orinoco, by the\r\nvast steppes of Caracas and of Cumana; and by a barrier far more\r\ndifficult to surmount, the nations of Caribbean origin. But\r\nnotwithstanding distance, and the numerous obstacles in the way of\r\nintercourse, the language of the Chayma Indians is a branch of the\r\nTamanac tongue. The oldest missionaries of Caripe are ignorant of\r\nthis curious fact, because the Capuchins of Aragon seldom visit the\r\nsouthern banks of the Orinoco, and scarcely know of the existence\r\nof the Tamanacs. I recognized the analogy between the idiom of this\r\nnation, and that of the Chayma Indians long after my return to\r\nEurope, in comparing the materials which I had collected with the\r\nsketch of a grammar published in Italy by an old missionary of the\r\nOrinoco. Without knowing the Chaymas, the Abbe Gili conjectured\r\nthat the language of the inhabitants of Paria must have some\r\nrelation to the Tamanac.* (* Vater has also advanced some\r\nwell-founded conjectures on the connexion between the Tamanac and\r\nCaribbean tongues and those spoken on the north-east coast of South\r\nAmerica. I may acquaint the reader, that I have written the words\r\nof the American languages according to the Spanish orthography, so\r\nthat the u should be pronounced oo, the ch like ch in English, etc.\r\nHaving during a great number of years spoken no other language than\r\nthe Castilian, I marked down the sounds according to the\r\northography of that language, and now I am afraid of changing the\r\nvalue of these signs, by substituting others no less imperfect. It\r\nis a barbarous practice, to express, like the greater part of the\r\nnations of Europe, the most simple and distinct sounds by many\r\nvowels, or many united consonants, while they might be indicated by\r\nletters equally simple. What a chaos is exhibited by the\r\nvocabularies written according to English, German, French, or\r\nSpanish notations! A new essay, which the illustrious author of the\r\ntravels in Egypt, M. Volney, is about to publish on the analysis of\r\nsounds found in different nations, and on the notation of those\r\nsounds according to a uniform system, will lead to great progress\r\nIn the study of languages.)\r\n\r\nI will prove this connection by two means which serve to show the\r\nanalogy of idioms; namely, the grammatical construction, and the\r\nidentity of words and roots. The following are the personal\r\npronouns of the Chaymas, which are at the same time possessive\r\npronouns; u-re, I, me; eu-re, thou, thee; teu-re, he, him. In the\r\nTamanac, u-re, I; amare or anja, thou; iteu-ja, he. The radical of\r\nthe first and of third person is in the Chayma u and teu.* (* We\r\nmust not wonder at those roots which reduce themselves to a single\r\nvowel. In a language of the Old Continent, the structure of which\r\nis so artificially complicated, (the Biscayan,) the family name\r\nUgarte (between the waters) contains the u of ura (water) and arte\r\nbetween. The g is added for the sake of euphony.) The same roots\r\nare found in the Tamanac.\r\n\r\nTABLE OF CHAYMA AND TAMANAC WORDS COMPARED:\r\n\r\nCOLUMN 1 : English.\r\n\r\nCOLUMN 2 : CHAYMA.\r\n\r\nCOLUMN 3 : TAMANAC.\r\n\r\n  I               : Ure         : Ure.\r\n  water           : Tuna        : Tuna.\r\n  rain            : Conopo*     : Canopo.* (* The same word, conopo,\r\n                                    signifies rain and year.

Among savage nations,\r\n                                    amidst so many confused ideas, we find\r\n                                    certain reminiscences well worthy of\r\n                                    attention. Among the Greenlanders Nuna\r\n                                    signifies the earth, and Anoningat\r\n                                    the moon.)\r\n  a tree          : Je          : Jeje.\r\n  a house         : Ata         : Aute.\r\n  to you          : Euya        : Auya.\r\n  to you          : Toya        : Iteuya.\r\n  honey           : Guane       : Uane.\r\n  he has said it  : Nacaramayre : Nacaramai.\r\n a physician,\r\n    a sorcerer    : Piache      : Psiache.\r\n  one             : Tibin       : Obin (in Jaoi, Tewin).\r\n  two             : Aco         : Oco (in Caribbean, Occo).\r\n  two             : Oroa        : Orua (in Caribbean, Oroa).\r\n  flesh           : Pun         : Punu.\r\n  no (negation)   : Pra         : Pra.\r\n\r\nThe verb to be, is expressed in Chayma by az. On adding to the verb\r\nthe personal pronoun I (u from u-re), a g is placed, for the sake\r\nof euphony, before the u, as in guaz, I am, properly g-u-az. As the\r\nfirst person is known by an u, the second is designated by an m,\r\nthe third by an i; maz, thou art; muerepuec araquapemaz? why art\r\nthou sad? properly what for sad thou art; punpuec topuchemaz, thou\r\nart fat in body, properly flesh (pun) for (puec) fat (topuche) thou\r\nart (maz). The possessive pronouns precede the substantive; upatay,\r\nin my house, properly my house in. All the prepositions and the\r\nnegation pra are incorporated at the end, as in the Tamanac. They\r\nsay in Chayma, ipuec, with him, properly him with; euya, to thee,\r\nor thee to; epuec charpe guaz, I am gay with thee, properly thee\r\nwith gay I am; ucarepra, not as I, properly I as not; quenpotupra\r\nquoguaz, I do not know him, properly him knowing not I am; quenepra\r\nquoguaz, I have not seen him, properly him seeing not I am. In the\r\nTamanac tongue, acurivane means beautiful, and acurivanepra,\r\nugly--not beautiful; outapra, there is no fish, properly fish none;\r\nuteripipra, I will not go, properly I to go will not, composed of\r\nuteri,* to go, ipiri, to choose, and pra, not. (* In Chayma:\r\nutechire, I will go also, properly I (u) to go (the radical ute,\r\nor, because of the preceding vowel, te) also (chere, or ere, or\r\nire). In utechire we find the Tamanac verb to go, uteri, of which\r\nute is also the radical, and ri the termination of the Infinitive.\r\nIn order to show that in Chayma chere or ere indicates the adverb\r\nalso, I shall cite from the fragment of a vocabulary in my\r\npossession, u-chere, I also; nacaramayre, he said so also;\r\nguarzazere, I carried also; charechere, to carry also. In the\r\nTamanac, as in the Chayma, chareri signifies to carry.) Among the\r\nCaribbees, whose language also bears some relation to the Tamanac,\r\nthough infinitely less than the Chayma, the negation is expressed\r\nby an m placed before the verb: amoyenlengati, it is very cold; and\r\nmamoyenlengati, it is not very cold. In an analogous manner, the\r\nparticle mna added to the Tamanac verb, not at the end, but by\r\nintercalation, gives it a negative sense, as taro, to say,\r\ntaromnar, not to say.\r\n\r\nThe verb to be, very irregular in all languages, is az or ats in\r\nChayma; and uochiri (in composition uac, uatscha) in Tamanac. It\r\nserves not only to form the Passive, but it is added also, as by\r\nagglutination, to the radical of attributive verbs, in a number of\r\ntenses.* (* The present in the Tamanac, jarer-bae-ure, appears to\r\nme nothing else then the verb bac, or uac (from uacschiri, to be ),\r\nadded to the radical to carry, jare (in the infinitive jareri), the\r\nresult of which is carrying to be I.) These agglutinations remind\r\nus of the employment in the Sanscrit of the auxiliary verbs as and\r\nbhu (asti and bhavati* (* In the branch of the Germanic languages\r\nwe find bhu under the forms bim, bist; as, in the forms vas, vast,\r\nvesum (Bopp page 138).)); the Latin, of es and fu, or fus;* (*\r\nHence fu-ero; amav-issem; amav-eram; pos-sum (pot-sum).) the\r\nBiscayan, of izan, ucan, and eguin. There are certain points in\r\nwhich idioms the most dissimilar concur one with another. That\r\nwhich is common in the intellectual organization of man is\r\nreflected in the general structure of language; and every idiom,\r\nhowever barbarous it may appear, discloses a regulating principle\r\nwhich has presided at its formation.\r\n\r\nThe plural, in Tamanac, is indicated in seven different ways,\r\naccording to the termination of the substantive, or according as it\r\ndesignates an animate or inanimate object.* (* Tamanacu, a Tamanac\r\n(plur. Tamanakemi): Pongheme, a Spaniard (properly a man clothed);\r\nPongamo, Spaniards, or men clothed. The plural in cne characterizes\r\ninanimate objects: for example, cene, a thing; cenecne, things:\r\njeje, a tree; jejecne, trees.) In Chayma the plural is formed as in\r\nCaribbee, in on; teure, himself; teurecon, themselves; tanorocon,\r\nthose here; montaonocon, those below, supposing that the\r\ninterlocutor is speaking of a place where he was himself present;\r\nmiyonocon, those below, supposing he speaks of a place where he was\r\nnot present. The Chaymas have also the Castilian adverbs aqui and\r\nalla, shades of difference which can be expressed only by\r\nperiphrasis, in the idioms of Germanic and Latin origin.\r\n\r\nSome Indians, who were acquainted with Spanish, assured us, that\r\nzis signified not only the sun, but also the Deity. This appeared\r\nto me the more extraordinary, as among all other American nations\r\nwe find distinct words for God and the sun. The Carib does not\r\nconfound Tamoussicabo, the Ancient of Heaven, with veyou, the sun.\r\nEven the Peruvian, though a worshipper of the sun, raises his mind\r\nto the idea of a Being who regulates the movements of the stars.\r\nThe sun, in the language of the Incas, bears the name of inti,* (*\r\nIn the Quichua, or language of the Incas, the sun is inti; love,\r\nmunay; great, veypul; in Sanscrit, the sun, indre: love, manya;\r\ngreat, vipulo. (Vater Mithridates tome 3 page 333.) These are the\r\nonly examples of analogy of sound, that have yet been noticed. The\r\ngrammatical character of the two languages is totally different.)\r\nnearly the same as in Sanscrit; while God is called Vinay Huayna,\r\nthe eternally young.'* (* Vinay, always, or eternal; huayna, in the\r\nflower of age.)\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of words in the Chayma is similar to that found in\r\nall the languages of both continents, which have preserved a\r\ncertain primitive character. The object is placed before the verb,\r\nthe verb before the personal pronoun. The object, on which the\r\nattention should be principally fixed, precedes all the\r\nmodifications of that object. The American would say, liberty\r\ncomplete love we, instead of we love complete liberty; Thee with\r\nhappy am I, instead of I am happy with thee. There is something\r\ndirect, firm, demonstrative, in these turns, the simplicity of\r\nwhich is augmented by the absence of the article. May it be\r\npresumed that, with advancing civilization, these nations, left to\r\nthemselves, would have gradually changed the arrangement of their\r\nphrases? We are led to adopt this idea, when we reflect on the\r\nchanges which the syntax of the Romans has undergone in the\r\nprecise, clear, but somewhat timid languages of Latin Europe.\r\n\r\nThe Chayma, like the Tamanac and most of the American languages, is\r\nentirely destitute of certain letters, as f, b, and d. No word\r\nbegins with an l. The same observation has been made on the Mexican\r\ntongue, though it is overcharged with the syllables tli, tla, and\r\nitl, at the end or in the middle of words. The Chaymas substitute r\r\nfor l; a substitution that arises from a defect of pronunciation\r\ncommon in every zone.* (* For example, the substitution of r for l,\r\ncharacterizes the Bashmurie dialect of the Coptic language.) Thus,\r\nthe Caribbees of the Orinoco have been transformed into Galibi in\r\nFrench Guiana by confounding r with l, and softening the c. The\r\nTamanac has made choraro and solalo of the Spanish word soldado\r\n(soldier). The disappearance of the f and b in so many American\r\nidioms arises out of that intimate connection between certain\r\nsounds, which is manifested in all languages of the same origin.\r\nThe letters f, v, b, and p, are substituted one for the other; for\r\ninstance, in the Persian, peder, father (pater); burader,* (*\r\nWhence the German bruder, with the same consonants.) brother\r\n(frater); behar, spring (ver); in Greek, phorton (forton), a\r\nburthen; pous (pous) a foot, (fuss, Germ.). In the same manner,\r\nwith the Americans, f and b become p; and d becomes t. The Chayma\r\npronounces patre, Tios, Atani, aracapucha, for padre, Dios, Adan,\r\nand arcabuz (harquebuss).\r\n\r\nIn spite of the relations just pointed out, I do not think that the\r\nChayma language can be regarded as a dialect of the Tamanac, as the\r\nMaitano, Cuchivero, and Crataima undoubtedly are. There are many\r\nessential differences; and between the two languages there appears\r\nto me to exist merely the same connection as is found in the\r\nGerman, the Swedish, and the English. They belong to the same\r\nsubdivision of the great family of the Tamanac, Caribbean, and\r\nArowak tongues. As there exists no absolute measure of resemblance\r\nbetween idioms, the degrees of parentage can be indicated only by\r\nexamples taken from known tongues. We consider those as being of\r\nthe same family, which bear affinity one to the other, as the\r\nGreek, the German, the Persian, and the Sanscrit.\r\n\r\nSome philologists have imagined, on comparing languages, that they\r\nmay all be divided into two classes, of which some, comparatively\r\nperfect in their organization, easy and rapid in their movements,\r\nindicate an interior development by inflexion; while others, more\r\nrude and less susceptible of improvement, present only a crude\r\nassemblage of small forms or agglutinated particles, each\r\npreserving the physiognomy peculiar to itself; when it is\r\nseparately employed. This very ingenious view would be deficient in\r\naccuracy were it supposed that there exist polysyllabic idioms\r\nwithout any inflexion, or that those which are organically\r\ndeveloped as by interior germs, admit no external increase by means\r\nof suffixes and affixes;* (* Even in the Sanscrit several tenses\r\nare formed by aggregation; for example, in the first future, the\r\nsubstantive verb to be is added to the radical. In a similar manner\r\nwe find in the Greek mach-eso, if the s be not the effect of\r\ninflexion, and in Latin pot-ero (Bopp pages 26 and 66). These are\r\nexamples of incorporation and agglutination in the grammatical\r\nsystem of languages which are justly cited as models of an interior\r\ndevelopment by inflexion. In the grammatical system of the American\r\ntongues, for example in the Tamanac, tarecschi, I will carry, is\r\nequally composed of the radical ar (infin. jareri, to carry) and of\r\nthe verb ecschi (Infin. nocschiri, to be). There hardly exists in\r\nthe American languages a triple mode of aggregation, of which we\r\ncannot find a similar and analogous example in some other language\r\nthat is supposed to develop itself only by inflexion.) an increase\r\nwhich we have already mentioned several times under the name of\r\nagglutination or incorporation. Many things, which appear to us at\r\npresent inflexions of a radical, have perhaps been in their origin\r\naffixes, of which there have barely remained one or two consonants.\r\nIn languages, as in everything in nature that is organized, nothing\r\nis entirely isolated or unlike. The farther we penetrate into their\r\ninternal structure, the more do contrasts and decided characters\r\nvanish. It may be said that they are like clouds, the outlines of\r\nwhich do not appear well defined, except when viewed at a distance.\r\n\r\nBut though we may not admit one simple and absolute principle in\r\nthe classification of languages, yet it cannot be decided, that in\r\ntheir present state some manifest a greater tendency to inflexion,\r\nothers to external aggregation. It is well known, that the\r\nlanguages of the Indian, Pelasgic, and German branch, belong to the\r\nfirst division; the American idioms, the Coptic or ancient\r\nEgyptian, and to a certain degree, the Semitic languages and the\r\nBiscayan, to the second. The little we have made known of the idiom\r\nof the Chaymas of Caripe, sufficiently proves that constant\r\ntendency towards the incorporation or aggregation of certain forms,\r\nwhich it is easy to separate; though from a somewhat refined\r\nsentiment of euphony some letters have been dropped and others have\r\nbeen added. Those affixes, by lengthening words, indicate the most\r\nvaried relations of number, time, and motion.\r\n\r\nWhen we reflect on the peculiar structure of the American\r\nlanguages, we imagine we discover the source of the opinion\r\ngenerally entertained from the most remote time in the Missions,\r\nthat these languages have an analogy with the Hebrew and the\r\nBiscayan. At the convent of Caripe as well as at the Orinoco, in\r\nPeru as well as in Mexico, I heard this opinion expressed,\r\nparticularly by monks who had some vague notions of the Semitic\r\nlanguages. Did motives supposed to be favourable to religion, give\r\nrise to this extraordinary theory? In the north of America, among\r\nthe Choctaws and the Chickasaws, travellers somewhat credulous have\r\nheard the strains of the Hallelujah* of the Hebrews (* L'Escarbot,\r\nCharlevoix, and even Adair (Hist. of the American Indians 1775).);\r\nas, according to the Pundits, the three sacred words of the\r\nmysteries of the Eleusis* (konx om pax) resound still in the\r\nIndies. (* Asiat. Res. volume 5, Ouvaroff on the Eleusinian\r\nMysteries 1816.) I do not mean to suggest, that the nations of\r\nLatin Europe may have called whatever has a foreign physiognomy\r\nHebrew or Biscayan, as for a long time all those monuments were\r\ncalled Egyptian, which were not in the Grecian or Roman style. I am\r\nrather disposed to think that the grammatical system of the\r\nAmerican idioms has confirmed the missionaries of the sixteenth\r\ncentury in their ideas respecting the Asiatic origin of the nations\r\nof the New World. The tedious compilation of Father Garcia, Tratado\r\ndel Origen de los Indios,* (* Treatise on the Origin of the\r\nIndians.) is a proof of this. The position of the possessive and\r\npersonal pronouns at the end of the noun and the verb, as well as\r\nthe numerous tenses of the latter, characterize the Hebrew and the\r\nother Semitic languages. Some of the missionaries were struck at\r\nfinding the same peculiarities in the American tongues: they did\r\nnot reflect, that the analogy of a few scattered features does not\r\nprove languages to belong to the same stock.\r\n\r\nIt appears less astonishing, that men, who are well acquainted with\r\nonly two languages extremely heterogeneous, the Castilian and the\r\nBiscayan, should have found in the latter a family resemblance to\r\nthe American languages. The composition of words, the facility with\r\nwhich the partial elements are detected, the forms of the verbs,\r\nand their different modifications, may have caused and kept up this\r\nillusion. But we repeat, an equal tendency towards aggregation or\r\nincorporation does not constitute an identity of origin. The\r\nfollowing are examples of the relations between the American and\r\nBiscayan languages; idioms totally different in their roots.\r\n\r\nIn Chayma, quenpotupra quoguaz, I do not know, properly, knowing\r\nnot I am. In Tamanac, jarer-uac-ure, bearing am I,--I bear;\r\nanarepra aichi, he will not bear, properly, bearing not will he;\r\npatcurbe, good; patcutari, to make himself good; Tamanacu, a\r\nTamanac; Tamanacutari, to make himself a Tainanac; Pongheme, a\r\nSpaniard; ponghemtari, to Spaniardize himself; tenecchi, I will\r\nsee; teneicre, I will see again; teecha, I go; tecshare, I return;\r\nmaypur butke, a little Maypure Indian; aicabutke, a little woman;\r\nmaypuritaje, an ugly Maypure Indian; aicataje, an ugly woman.* (*\r\nThe diminutive of woman (aica) or of Maypure Indian is formed by\r\nadding butke, which is the termination of cujuputke, little: taje\r\nanswers to the accio of the Italians.)\r\n\r\nIn Biscayan: maitetutendot, I love him, properly, I loving have\r\nhim; beguia, the eye, and beguitsa, to see; aitagana, towards the\r\nfather: by adding tu, we form the verb aitaganatu, to go towards\r\nthe father; ume-tasuna, soft and infantile ingenuity; umequeria,\r\ndisagreeable childishness.\r\n\r\nI may add to these examples some descriptive compounds, which call\r\nto mind the infancy of nations, and strike us equally in the\r\nAmerican and Biscayan languages, by a certain ingenuousness of\r\nexpression. In Tamanac, the wasp (uane-imu), father (im-de) of\r\nhoney (uane);* (* It may not be unnecessary here to acquaint the\r\nreader that honey is produced by an insect of South America,\r\nbelonging to, or nearly allied, to the wasp genus. This honey,\r\nhowever, possesses noxious qualities which are by some naturalists\r\nattributed to the plant Paulinia Australis, the juices of which are\r\ncollected by the insect.) the toes, ptarimucuru, properly, the sons\r\nof the foot; the fingers, amgnamucuru, the sons of the hand;\r\nmushrooms, jeje-panari, properly, the ears (panari) of a tree\r\n(jeje); the veins of the hand, amgna-mitti, properly, the ramified\r\nroots; leaves, prutpe-jareri, properly, the hair at the top of the\r\ntree; puirene-veju, properly, the sun (veju), straight or\r\nperpendicular; lightning, kinemeru-uaptori, properly, the fire\r\n(uapto) of the thunder, or of the storm. (I recognise in kinemeru,\r\nthunder or storm, the root kineme black.) In Biscayan, becoquia,\r\nthe forehead, what belongs (co and quia) to the eye (beguia);\r\nodotsa, the noise (otsa) of the cloud (odeia), or thunder;\r\narribicia, an echo, properly, the animated stone, from arria,\r\nstone, and bicia, life.\r\n\r\nThe Chayma and Tamanac verbs have an enormous complication of\r\ntenses: two Presents, four Preterites, three Futures. This\r\nmultiplicity characterises the rudest American languages. Astarloa\r\nreckons, in like manner, in the grammatical system of the Biscayan,\r\ntwo hundred and six forms of the verb. Those languages, the\r\nprincipal tendency of which is inflexion, are to the common\r\nobserver less interesting than those which seem formed by\r\naggregation. In the first, the elements of which words are\r\ncomposed, and which are generally reduced to a few letters, are no\r\nlonger recognisable: these elements, when isolated, exhibit no\r\nmeaning; the whole is assimilated and mingled together. The\r\nAmerican languages, on the contrary, are like complicated machines,\r\nthe wheels of which are exposed to view. The mechanism of their\r\nconstruction is visible. We seem to be present at their formation,\r\nand we should pronounce them to be of very recent origin, did we\r\nnot recollect that the human mind steadily follows an impulse once\r\ngiven; that nations enlarge, improve, and repair the grammatical\r\nedifice of their languages, according to a plan already determined;\r\nfinally, that there are countries, whose languages, institutions,\r\nand arts, have remained unchanged, we might almost say stereotyped,\r\nduring the lapse of ages.\r\n\r\nThe highest degree of intellectual development has been hitherto\r\nfound among the nations of the Indian and Pelasgic branch. The\r\nlanguages formed principally by aggregation seem themselves to\r\noppose obstacles to the improvement of the mind. They are devoid of\r\nthat rapid movement, that interior life, to which the inflexion of\r\nthe root is favourable, and which impart such charms to works of\r\nimagination. Let us not, however, forget, that a people celebrated\r\nin remote antiquity, a people from whom the Greeks themselves\r\nborrowed knowledge, had perhaps a language, the construction of\r\nwhich recalls involuntarily that of the languages of America. What\r\na structure of little monosyllabic and disyllabic forms is added to\r\nthe verb and to the substantive, in the Coptic language! The\r\nsemi-barbarous Chayma and Tamanac have tolerably short abstract\r\nwords to express grandeur, envy, and lightness, cheictivate, uoite,\r\nand uonde; but in Coptic, the word malice,* metrepherpetou, is\r\ncomposed of five elements, easy to be distinguished. (* See, on the\r\nincontestable identity of the ancient Egyptian and Coptic, and on\r\nthe particular system of synthesis of the latter language, the\r\ningenious reflexions of M. Silvestre de Sacy, in the Notice des\r\nRecherches de M. Etienne Quatremere sur La Litterature de l'Epypte.\r\n) This compound signifies the quality (met) of a subject (reph),\r\nwhich makes (er) the thing which is (pet), evil (ou). Nevertheless\r\nthe Coptic language has had its literature, like the Chinese, the\r\nroots of which, far from being aggregated, scarcely approach each\r\nother without immediate contact. We must admit that nations once\r\nroused from their lethargy, and tending towards civilization, find\r\nin the most uncouth languages the secret of expressing with\r\nclearness the conceptions of the mind, and of painting the emotions\r\nof the soul. Don Juan de la Rea, a highly estimable man, who\r\nperished in the sanguinary revolutions of Quito, imitated with\r\ngraceful simplicity some Idylls of Theocritus in the language of\r\nthe Incas; and I have been assured, that, excepting treatises on\r\nscience and philosophy, there is scarcely any work of modern\r\nliterature that might not be translated into the Peruvian.\r\n\r\nThe intimate connection established between the natives of the New\r\nWorld and the Spaniards since the conquest, have introduced a\r\ncertain number of American words into the Castilian language. Some\r\nof these words express things not unknown before the discovery of\r\nthe New World, and scarcely recall to our minds at present their\r\nbarbarous origin.* (* For example savannah, and cannibal.) Almost\r\nall belong to the language of the great Antilles, formerly termed\r\nthe language of Haiti, of Quizqueja, or of Itis.* (* The word Itis,\r\nfor Haiti or St. Domingo (Hispaniola), is found in the Itinerarium\r\nof Bishop Geraldini (Rome 1631.)--\"Quum Colonus Itim insulam\r\ncerneret.\") I shall confine myself to citing the words maiz,\r\ntabaco, canoa, batata, cacique, balsa, conuco, etc. When the\r\nSpaniards, after the year 1498, began to visit the mainland, they\r\nalready had words* to designate the vegetable productions most\r\nuseful to man, and common both to the islands and to the coasts of\r\nCumana and Paria. (* The following are Haitian words, in their real\r\nform, which have passed into the Castilian language since the end\r\nof the 15th century. Many of them are not uninteresting to\r\ndescriptive botany. Ahi (Capsicum baccatum), batata (Convolvus\r\nbatatas), bihao (Heliconia bihai), caimito (Chrysophyllum caimito),\r\ncahoba (Swietenia mahagoni), jucca and casabi (Jatropba manihot);\r\nthe word casabi or cassava is employed only for the bread made with\r\nthe roots of the Jatropha (the name of the plant jucca was also\r\nheard by Americo Vespucci on the coast of Paria); age or ajes\r\n(Dioscorea alata), copei (Clusia alba), guayacan (Guaiacum\r\nofficinale), guajaba (Psidium pyriferum), guanavano (Anona\r\nmuricata), mani (Arachis hypogaea), guama (Inga), henequen (was\r\nsupposed from the erroneous accounts of the first travellers to be\r\nan herb with which the Haitians used to cut metals; it means now\r\nevery kind of strong thread), hicaco (Chrysobalanus icaco), maghei\r\n(Agave Americana), mahiz or maiz (Zea, maize), mamei (Mammea\r\nAmericana), mangle (Rhizophora), pitahaja (Cactus pitahaja), ceiba\r\n(Bombax), tuna (Cactus tuna), hicotea (a tortoise), iguana (Lacerta\r\niguana), manatee (Trichecus manati), nigua (Pulex penetrans),\r\nhamaca (a hammock), balsa (a raft; however balsa is an old\r\nCastilian word signifying a pool of water), barbacoa (a small bed\r\nof light wood, or reeds), canei or buhio (a hut), canoa (a canoe),\r\ncocujo (Elater noctilucus, the fire-fly), chicha (fermented\r\nliquor), macana (a large stick or club, made with the petioles of a\r\npalm-tree), tabaco (not the herb, but the pipe through which it is\r\nsmoked), cacique (a chief). Other American words, now as much in\r\nuse among the Creoles, as the Arabic words naturalized in the\r\nSpanish, do not belong to the Haitian tongue; for example, caiman,\r\npiragua, papaja (Carica), aguacate (Persea), tarabita, paramo. Abbe\r\nGili thinks with some probability, that they are derived from the\r\ntongue of some people who inhabited the temperate climate between\r\nCoro, the mountains of Merida, and the tableland of Bogota. (Saggio\r\nvolume 3 page 228.) How many Celtic and German words would not\r\nJulius Caesar and Tacitus have handed down to us, had the\r\nproductions of the northern countries visited by the Romans\r\ndiffered as much from the Italian and Roman, as those of\r\nequinoctial America!) Not satisfied with retaining these words\r\nborrowed from the Haitians, they helped also to spread them all\r\nover America (at a period when the language of Haiti was already a\r\ndead language), and to diffuse them among nations who were ignorant\r\neven of the existence of the West India Islands. Some words, which\r\nare in daily use in the Spanish colonies, are attributed\r\nerroneously to the Haitians. Banana is from the Chaconese, the\r\nMbaja language; arepa (bread of manioc, or of the Jatropha manihot)\r\nand guayuco (an apron, perizoma) are Caribbee: curiara (a very long\r\nboat) is Tamanac: chinchorro (a hammock), and tutuma (the fruit of\r\nthe Crescentia cujete, or a vessel to contain a liquid), are Chayma\r\nwords.\r\n\r\nI have dwelt thus long on considerations respecting the American\r\ntongues, because I am desirous of directing attention to the deep\r\ninterest attached to this kind of research. This interest is\r\nanalogous to that inspired by the monuments of semi-barbarous\r\nnations, which are examined not because they deserve to be ranked\r\namong works of art, but because the study of them throws light on\r\nthe history of our species, and the progressive development of our\r\nfaculties.\r\n\r\nIt now remains for me to speak of the other Indian nations\r\ninhabiting the provinces of Cumana and Barcelona. These I shall\r\nonly succinctly enumerate.\r\n\r\n1. The Pariagotos or Parias.\r\n\r\nIt is thought that the terminations in goto, as Pariagoto,\r\nPurugoto, Avarigoto, Acherigoto, Cumanagoto, Arinagoto,\r\nKirikirisgoto,* (* The Kirikirisgotos (or Kirikiripas) are of Dutch\r\nGuiana. It is very remarkable, that among the small Brazilian\r\ntribes who do not speak the language of the Tupis, the Kiriris,\r\nnotwithstanding the enormous distance of 650 leagues, have several\r\nTamanac words.) imply a Caribbean origin.* (* In the Tamanac\r\ntongue, which is of the same branch as the Caribbean, we find also\r\nthe termination goto, as in anekiamgoto an animal. Often an analogy\r\nin the termination of names, far from showing an identity of race,\r\nonly indicates that the names of the nations are borrowed from one\r\nlanguage.) All these tribes, excepting the Purugotos of the Rio\r\nCaura, formerly occupied the country which has been so long under\r\nthe dominion of the Caribbees; namely, the coasts of Berbice and of\r\nEssequibo, the peninsula of Paria, the plains of Piritu and Parima.\r\nBy this last name the little-known country, between the sources of\r\nthe Cujuni, the Caroni, and the Mao, is designated in the Missions.\r\nThe Paria Indians are mingled in part with the Chaymas of Cumana;\r\nothers have been settled by the Capuchins of Aragon in the Missions\r\nof Caroni; for instance, at Cupapuy and Alta-Gracia, where they\r\nstill speak their own language, apparently a dialect between the\r\nTamanac and the Caribbee. But it may be asked, is the name Parias\r\nor Pariagotos, a name merely geographical? Did the Spaniards, who\r\nfrequented these coasts from their first establishment in the\r\nisland of Cubagua and in Macarapana, give the name of the\r\npromontory of Paria* to the tribe by which it was inhabited? (*\r\nParia, Uraparia, even Huriaparia and Payra, are the ancient names\r\nof the country, written as the first navigators thought they heard\r\nthem pronounced. It appears to me by no means probable, that the\r\npromontory of Paria should derive its name from that of a cacique\r\nUriapari, celebrated for the manner in which he resisted Diego\r\nOrdaz in 1530, thirty-two years after Columbus had heard the name\r\nof Paria from the mouths of the natives themselves. The Orinoco at\r\nits mouth had also the name of Uriapari, Yuyapari, or Iyupari. In\r\nall these denominations of a great river, of a shore, and of a\r\nrainy country, I think I recognise the radical par, signifying\r\nwater, not only in the languages of these countries, but also in\r\nthose of nations very distant from one another on the eastern and\r\nwestern coasts of America. The sea, or great water, is in the\r\nCaribbean, Maypure, and Brazilian languages, parana: in the\r\nTamanac, parava. In Upper Guiana also the Orinoco is called Parava.\r\nIn the Peruvian, or Quichua, I find rain, para; to rain, parani.\r\nBesides, there is a lake in Peru that has been very anciently\r\ncalled Paria. (Garcia, Origen de los Indios, page 292.) I have\r\nentered into these minute details concerning the word Paria,\r\nbecause it has recently been supposed that some connection might be\r\ntraced between this word and the country of the Hindoo caste called\r\nthe Parias.) This we will not positively affirm; for the Caribbees\r\nthemselves give the name of Caribana to a country which they\r\noccupied, and which extended from the Rio Sinu to the gulf of\r\nDarien. This is a striking example of identity of name between an\r\nAmerican nation and the territory it possessed. We may conceive,\r\nthat in a state of society, where residence is not long fixed, such\r\ninstances must be very rare.\r\n\r\n2. The Guaraons or Gu-ara-una, almost all free and independent, are\r\ndispersed in the Delta of the Orinoco, with the variously ramified\r\nchannels of which they alone are well acquainted. The Caribbees\r\ncall the Guaraons U-ara-u. They owe their independence to the\r\nnature of their country; for the missionaries, in spite of their\r\nzeal, have not been tempted to follow them to the tree-tops. The\r\nGuaraons, in order to raise their abodes above the surface of the\r\nwaters at the period of the great inundations, support them on the\r\nhewn trunks of the mangrove-tree and of the Mauritia palm-tree.* (*\r\nTheir manners have been the same from time immemorial. Cardinal\r\nBembo described them at the beginning of the 16th century,\r\n\"quibusdam in locis propter paludes incolae domus in arboribus\r\naedificant.\" (Hist. Venet. 1551.) Sir Walter Raleigh, in 1595,\r\nspeaks of the Guaraons under the names of Araottes, Trivitivas, and\r\nWarawites. These were perhaps the names of some tribes, into which\r\nthe great Guaraonese nation was divided. (Barrere Essai sur l'Hist.\r\nNaturelle de la France Equinoctiale.)) They make bread of the\r\nmedullary flour of this palm-tree, which is the sago of America.\r\nThe flour bears the name of yuruma: I have eaten it at the town of\r\nSt. Thomas, in Guiana, and it was very agreeable to the taste,\r\nresembling rather the cassava-bread than the sago of India.* (* M.\r\nKunth has combined together three genera of the palms, Calamus,\r\nSigus, and Mauritia, in a new section, the Calameae.) The Indians\r\nassured me that the trunks of the Mauritia, the tree of life so\r\nmuch vaunted by father Gumilla, do not yield meal in any abundance,\r\nunless the palm-tree is cut down just before the flowers appear.\r\nThus too the maguey,* (* Agave Americana, the aloe of our gardens.)\r\ncultivated in New Spain, furnishes a saccharine liquor, the wine\r\n(pulque) of the Mexicans, only at the period when the plant shoots\r\nforth its long stem. By interrupting the blossoming, nature is\r\nobliged to carry elsewhere the saccharine or amylaceous matter,\r\nwhich would accumulate in the flowers of the maguey and in the\r\nfruit of the Mauritia. Some families of Guaraons, associated with\r\nthe Chaymas, live far from their native land, in the Missions of\r\nthe plains or llanos of Cumana; for instance, at Santa Rosa de\r\nOcopi. Five or six hundred of them voluntarily quitted their\r\nmarshes, a few years ago, and formed, on the northern and southern\r\nbanks of the Orinoco, twenty-five leagues distant from Cape Barima,\r\ntwo considerable villages, under the names of Zacupana and Imataca.\r\nWhen I made my journey in Caripe, these Indians were still without\r\nmissionaries, and lived in complete independence. Their excellent\r\nqualities as boatmen, their perfect knowledge of the mouths of the\r\nOrinoco, and of the labyrinth of branches communicating with each\r\nother, give the Guaraons a certain political importance. They\r\nfavour that clandestine commerce of which the island of Trinidad is\r\nthe centre. The Guaraons run with extreme address on muddy lands,\r\nwhere the European, the Negro, or other Indians except themselves,\r\nwould not dare to walk; and it is, therefore, commonly believed,\r\nthat they are of lighter weight than the rest of the natives. This\r\nis also the opinion that is held in Asia of the Burat Tartars. The\r\nfew Guaraons whom I saw were of middle size, squat, and very\r\nmuscular. The lightness with which they walk in places newly dried,\r\nwithout sinking in, when even they have no planks tied to their\r\nfeet, seemed to me the effect of long habit. Though I sailed a\r\nconsiderable time on the Orinoco, I never went so low as its mouth.\r\nFuture travellers, who may visit those marshy regions, will rectify\r\nwhat I have advanced.\r\n\r\n3. The Guaiqueries or Guaikeri, are the most able and most intrepid\r\nfishermen of these countries. These people alone are well\r\nacquainted with the bank abounding with fish, which surrounds the\r\nislands of Coche, Margareta, Sola, and Testigos; a bank of more\r\nthan four hundred square leagues, extending east and west from\r\nManiquarez to the Boca del Draco. The Guaiqueries inhabit the\r\nisland of Margareta, the peninsula of Araya, and that suburb of\r\nCumana which bears their name. Their language is believed to be a\r\ndialect of that of the Guaraons. This would connect them with the\r\ngreat family of the Caribbee nations; and the missionary Gili is of\r\nopinion that the language of the Guaiqueries is one of the numerous\r\nbranches of the Caribbean tongue.* (* If the name of the port\r\nPam-patar, in the island of Margareta, be Guaiquerean, as we have\r\nno reason to doubt, it exhibits a feature of analogy with the\r\nCumanagoto tongue, which approaches the Caribbean and Tamanac. In\r\nTerra Firma, in the Piritu Missions, we find the village of\r\nCayguapatar, which signifies house of Caygua.) These affinities are\r\ninteresting, because they lead us to perceive an ancient connection\r\nbetween nations dispersed over a vast extent of country, from the\r\nmouth of the Rio Caura and the sources of the Erevato, in Parima,\r\nto French Guiana, and the coasts of Paria.* (* Are the Guaiqueries,\r\nor O-aikeries, now settled on the borders of the Erevato, and\r\nformerly between the Rio Caura and the Cuchivero near the little\r\ntown of Alta Gracia, of a different origin from the Guaikeries of\r\nCumana? I know also, in the interior of the country, in the\r\nMissions of the Piritus, near the village of San Juan Evangelista\r\ndel Guarive, a ravine very anciently called Guayquiricuar. These\r\nresemblances seem to prove migrations from the south-west towards\r\nthe coast. The termination cuar, found so often in Cumanagoto and\r\nCaribbean names, means a ravine, as in Guaymacuar (ravine of\r\nlizards), Pirichucuar (a ravine overshaded by pirichu or piritu\r\npalm-trees), Chiguatacuar (a ravine of land-shells). Raleigh\r\ndescribes the Guaiqueries under the name of Ouikeries. He calls the\r\nChaymas, Saimas, changing (according to the Caribbean\r\npronunciation) the ch into s.)\r\n\r\n4. The Quaquas, whom the Tamanacs call Mapoje, are a tribe formerly\r\nvery warlike and allied to the Caribbees. It is a curious\r\nphenomenon to find the Quaquas mingled with the Chaymas in the\r\nMissions of Cumana, for their language, as well as the Atura, of\r\nthe cataracts of the Orinoco, is a dialect of the Salive tongue;\r\nand their original abode was on the banks of the Assiveru, which\r\nthe Spaniards call Cuchivero. They have extended their migrations\r\none hundred leagues to the north-east. I have often heard them\r\nmentioned on the Orinoco, above the mouth of the Meta; and, what is\r\nvery remarkable, it is asserted* that missionary Jesuits have found\r\nQuaquas as far distant as the Cordilleras of Popayan. (* Vater tome\r\n3 part 2 page 364. The name of Quaqua is found on the coast of\r\nGuinea. The Europeans apply it to a horde of Negroes to the east of\r\nCape Lahou.) Raleigh enumerates, among the natives of the island of\r\nTrinidad, the Salives, a people remarkable for their mild manners;\r\nthey came from the Orinoco, and settled south of the Quaquas.\r\nPerhaps these two nations, which speak almost the same language,\r\ntravelled together towards the coasts.\r\n\r\n5. The Cumanagotos, or, according to the pronunciation of the\r\nIndians, Cumanacoto, are now settled westward of Cumana, in the\r\nMissions of Piritu, where they live by cultivating the ground. They\r\nnumber more than twenty-six thousand. Their language, like that of\r\nthe Palencas, or Palenques, and Guarivas, is between the Tamanac\r\nand the Caribbee, but nearer to the former. These are indeed idioms\r\nof the same family; but if we are to consider them as simple\r\ndialects, the Latin must be also called a dialect of the Greek, and\r\nthe Swedish a dialect of the German. In considering the affinity of\r\nlanguages one with another, it must not be forgotten that these\r\naffinities may be very differently graduated; and that it would be\r\na source of confusion not to distinguish between simple dialects\r\nand languages of the same family. The Cumanagotos, the Tamanacs,\r\nthe Chaymas, the Guaraons, and the Caribbees, do not understand\r\neach other, in spite of the frequent analogy of words and of\r\ngrammatical structure exhibited in their respective idioms. The\r\nCumanagotos inhabited, at the beginning of the sixteenth century,\r\nthe mountains of the Brigantine and of Parabolata. I am unable to\r\ndetermine whether the Piritus, Cocheymas, Chacopatas, Tomuzas, and\r\nTopocuares, now confounded in the same villages with the\r\nCumanagotos, and speaking their language, were originally tribes of\r\nthe same nation. The Piritus take their name from the ravine\r\nPirichucuar, where the small thorny palm-tree,* called piritu,\r\ngrows in abundance (* Caudice gracili aculeato, foliis pinnatis.\r\nPossibly of the genus Aiphanes of Willdenouw.); the wood of this\r\ntree, which is excessively hard, and little combustible, serves to\r\nmake pipes. On this spot the village of La Concepcion de Piritu was\r\nfounded in 1556; it is the chief settlement of the Cumanagoto\r\nMissions, known by the name of the Misiones de Piritu.\r\n\r\n6. The Caribbees (Carives). This name, which was given them by the\r\nfirst navigators, is retained throughout all Spanish America. The\r\nFrench and the Germans have transformed it, I know not why, into\r\nCaraibes. The people call themselves Carina, Calina, and Callinago.\r\nI visited some Caribbean Missions in the Llanos,* (* I shall in\r\nfuture use the word Llanos (loca plana, suppressing the p), without\r\nadding the equivalent words pampas, savannahs, meadows, steppes, or\r\nplains. The country between the mountains of the coast and the left\r\nbank of the Orinoco, constitutes the llanos of Cumana, Barcelona,\r\nand Caracas.) on returning from my journey to the Orinoco; and I\r\nshall merely mention that the Galibes (Caribi of Cayenne), the\r\nTuapocas, and the Cunaguaras, who originally inhabited the plains\r\nbetween the mountains of Caripe (Caribe) and the village of\r\nMaturin, the Jaoi of the island of Trinidad and of the province of\r\nCumana, and perhaps also the Guarivas, allies of the Palencas, are\r\nall tribes of the great Caribbee nation.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the other nations whose affinities of language with\r\nthe Tamanac and Caribbee have been mentioned, they are not\r\nnecessarily to be considered as of the same race. In Asia, the\r\nnations of Mongol origin differ totally in their physical\r\norganisation from those of Tartar origin. Such has been, however,\r\nthe intermixture of these nations, that, according to the able\r\nresearches of Klaproth, the Tartar languages (branches of the\r\nancient Oigour) are spoken at present by hordes incontestably of\r\nMongol race. Neither the analogy nor the diversity of language\r\nsuffice to solve the great problem of the filiation of nations;\r\nthey merely serve to point out probabilities. The Caribbees,\r\nproperly speaking, those who inhabit the Missions of the Cari, in\r\nthe llanos of Cumana, the banks of the Caura, and the plains to the\r\nnorth-east of the sources of the Orinoco, are distinguished by\r\ntheir almost gigantic size from all the other nations I have seen\r\nin the new continent. Must it on this account be admitted, that the\r\nCaribbees are an entirely distinct race? and that the Guaraons and\r\nthe Tamanacs, whose languages have an affinity with the Caribbee,\r\nhave no bond of relationship with them? I think not. Among the\r\nnations of the same family, one branch may acquire an extraordinary\r\ndevelopment of organization. The mountaineers of the Tyrol and\r\nSalzburgh are taller than the other Germanic races; the Samoiedes\r\nof the Altai are not so little and squat as those of the sea-coast.\r\nIn like manner it would be difficult to deny that the Galibis are\r\nreally Caribbees; and yet, notwithstanding the identity of\r\nlanguages, how striking is the difference in their stature and\r\nphysical constitution!\r\n\r\nBefore Cortez entered the capital of Montezuma in 1521, the\r\nattention of Europe was fixed on the regions we have just\r\ntraversed. In depicting the manners of the inhabitants of Paria and\r\nCumana, it was thought that the manners of all the inhabitants of\r\nthe new continent were described. This remark cannot escape those\r\nwho read the historians of the Conquest, especially the letters of\r\nPeter Martyr of Anghiera, written at the court of Ferdinand the\r\nCatholic. These letters are full of ingenious observations upon\r\nChristopher Columbus, Leo X, and Luther, and are stamped by noble\r\nenthusiasm for the great discoveries of an age so rich in\r\nextraordinary events. Without entering into any detail on the\r\nmanners of the nations which have been so long confounded one with\r\nanother, under the vague denomination of Cumanians (Cumaneses), it\r\nappears to me important to clear up a fact which I have often heard\r\ndiscussed in Spanish America.\r\n\r\nThe Pariagotos of the present time are of a brown red colour, as\r\nare the Caribbees, the Chaymas, and almost all the nations of the\r\nNew World. Why do the historians of the sixteenth century affirm\r\nthat the first navigators saw white men with fair hair at the\r\npromontory of Paria? Were they of the same race as those Indians of\r\na less tawny hue, whom M. Bonpland and myself saw at Esmeralda,\r\nnear the sources of the Orinoco? But these Indians had hair as\r\nblack as the Otomacs and other tribes, whose complexion is the\r\ndarkest. Were they albinos, such as have been found heretofore in\r\nthe isthmus of Panama? But examples of that degeneration are very\r\nrare in the copper-coloured race; and Anghiera, as well as Gomara,\r\nspeaks of the inhabitants of Paria in general, and not of a few\r\nindividuals. Both describe them as if they were people of Germanic\r\norigin,* (* \"Aethiopes nigri, crispi lanati; Pariae incolae albi,\r\ncapillis oblongis protensis flavis.\"--Pet. Martyr Ocean., dec. 50\r\nlib. 6 (edition 1574). \"Utriusque sexus indigenae albi veluti\r\nnostrates, praeter eos qui sub sole versantur.\" (The natives of\r\nboth sexes are as white as our people [Spaniards], except those who\r\nare exposed to the sun.)--Ibid. Gomara, speaking of the natives\r\nseen by Columbus at the mouth of the river of Cumana, says: \"Las\r\ndonzellas eran amorosas, desnudas y blancas (las de la casa); los\r\nIndios que van al campo estan negros del sol.\" (The young women are\r\nengaging in their manners: they wear no clothing, and those who\r\nlive in the houses ARE WHITE. The Indians who are much in the open\r\ncountry are black, from the effect of the sun.)--Hist. de los\r\nIndios, cap. 74. \"Los Indios de Paria son BLANCOS y rubios.\"--(The\r\nIndians of Paria are WHITE and red.) Garcia, Origen de los Indios\r\n1729, lib. 4 cap. 9.) they call them 'Whites with light hair;' they\r\neven add, that they wore garments like those of the Turks.* (*\r\n\"They wear round their head a striped cotton handkerchief\"--Ferd.\r\nColumb. cap. 71. (Churchill volume 2.) Was this kind of head-dress\r\ntaken for a turban? (Garcia, Origen de los Ind., page 303). I am\r\nsurprised that people of these regions should have worn a\r\nhead-dress; but, what is more curious still, Pinzon, in a voyage\r\nwhich he made alone to the coast of Paria, the particulars of which\r\nhave been transmitted to us by Peter Martyr of Anghiera, professes\r\nto have seen natives who were clothed: \"Incolas omnes genu tenus\r\nmares, foeminas surarum tenus, gossampinis vestibus amictos\r\nsimplicibus repererunt; sed viros more Turcorum insuto minutim\r\ngossypio ad belli usum duplicibus.\" (The natives were clothed in\r\nthin cotton garments; the men's reaching to the knee, and the\r\nwomen's to the calf of the leg. Their war-dress was thicker, and\r\nclosely stitched with cotton after the Turkish manner.)--Pet.\r\nMartyr, dec. 2 lib. 7. Who were these people described as being\r\ncomparatively civilized, and clothed with tunics (like those who\r\nlived an the summit of the Andes), and seen on a coast, where\r\nbefore and since the time of Pinzon, only naked men have ever been\r\nseen?) Gomara and Anghiera wrote from such oral information as they\r\nhad been able to collect.\r\n\r\nThese marvels disappear, if we examine the recital which Ferdinand\r\nColumbus drew up from his father's papers. There we find simply,\r\nthat \"the admiral was surprised to see the inhabitants of Paria,\r\nand those of the island of Trinidad, better made, more civilized\r\n(de buena conversacion), and whiter than the natives whom he had\r\npreviously seen.\"* (* Churchill's Collection volume 2, Herrera\r\npages 80, 83, 84. Munoz, Hist. del Nuevo Mundo volume 1, \"El color\r\nera baxo como es regular en los Indios, pero mas clara que en las\r\nislas reconocidas.\" (Their colour was dark, as is usual among the\r\nIndians; but lighter than that of the people of the islands\r\npreviously known.) The missionaries are accustomed to call those\r\nIndians who are less black, less tawny, WHITISH, and even ALMOST\r\nWHITE.--Gumilla, Hist. de l'Orenoque volume 1 chapter 5 paragraph\r\n2. Such incorrect expressions may mislead those who are not\r\naccustomed to the exaggerations in which travellers often indulge.)\r\nThis certainly did not mean that the Pariagotos are white. The\r\nlighter colour of the skin of the natives and the great coolness of\r\nthe mornings on the coast of Paria, seemed to confirm the fantastic\r\nhypothesis which that great man had framed, respecting the\r\nirregularity of the curvature of the earth, and the height of the\r\nplains in this region, which he regarded as the effect of an\r\nextraordinary swelling of the globe in the direction of the\r\nparallels of latitude. Amerigo Vespucci (in his pretended FIRST\r\nvoyage, apparently written from the narratives of other navigators)\r\ncompares the natives to the Tartar nations,* (* Vultu non multum\r\nspeciosi sunt, quoniam latas facies Tartariis adsimilatas habent.\r\n(Their countenances are not handsome, their cheek-bones being broad\r\nlike those of the Tartars.)--Americi Vesputii Navigatio Prima, in\r\nGryn's Orbis Novus 1555.) not in regard to their colour, but on\r\naccount of the breadth of their faces, and the general expression\r\nof their physiognomy.\r\n\r\nBut if it be certain, that at the end of the fifteenth century\r\nthere were on the coast of Cumana a few men with white skins, as\r\nthere are in our days, it must not thence be concluded, that the\r\nnatives of the New World exhibit everywhere a similar organization\r\nof the dermoidal system. It is not less inaccurate to say, that\r\nthey are all copper-coloured, than to affirm that they would not\r\nhave a tawny hue, if they were not exposed to the heat of the sun,\r\nor tanned by the action of the air. The natives may be divided into\r\ntwo very unequal portions with respect to numbers; to the first\r\nbelong the Esquimaux of Greenland, of Labrador, and the northern\r\ncoast of Hudson's Bay, the inhabitants of Behring's Straits, of the\r\npeninsula of Alaska, and of Prince William's Sound. The eastern and\r\nwestern branches* of this polar race (* Vater, in Mithridates\r\nvolume 3. Egede, Krantz, Hearne, Mackenzie, Portlock, Chwostoff,\r\nDavidoff, Resanoff, Merk, and Billing, have described the great\r\nfamily of these Tschougaz-Esquimaux.), the Esquimaux and the\r\nTschougases, though at the vast distance of eight hundred leagues\r\napart, are united by the most intimate analogy of languages. This\r\nanalogy extends even to the inhabitants of the north-east of Asia;\r\nfor the idiom of the Tschouktsches* at the mouth of the Anadir (* I\r\nmean here only the Tschouktsches who have fixed dwelling-places,\r\nfor the wandering Tschouktsches approach very near the Koriaks.),\r\nhas the same roots as the language of the Esquimaux who inhabit the\r\ncoast of America opposite to Europe. The Tschouktsches are the\r\nEsquimaux of Asia. Like the Malays, that hyperborean race reside\r\nonly on the sea-coasts. They are almost all smaller in stature than\r\nthe other Americans, and are quick, lively, and talkative. Their\r\nhair is almost straight, and black; but their skin (and this is\r\nvery characteristic of the race, which I shall designate under the\r\nname of Tschougaz-Esquimaux) is originally whitish. It is certain\r\nthat the children of the Greenlanders are born white; some retain\r\nthat whiteness; and often in the brownest (the most tanned) the\r\nredness of the blood is seen to appear on their cheeks.* (* Krantz,\r\nHist. of Greenland 1667 tome 1. Greenland does not seem to have\r\nbeen inhabited in the eleventh century; at least the Esquimaux\r\nappeared only in the fourteenth, coming from the west.)\r\n\r\nThe second portion of the natives of America includes all those\r\nnations which are not Tschougaz-Esquimaux, beginning from Cook's\r\nRiver to the Straits of Magellan, from the Ugaljachmouzes and the\r\nKinaese of Mount St. Elias, to the Puelches and Tehuelhets of the\r\nsouthern hemisphere. The men who belong to this second branch, are\r\ntaller, stronger, more warlike, and more taciturn than the others.\r\nThey present also very remarkable differences in the colour of\r\ntheir skin. In Mexico, Peru, New Grenada, Quito, on the banks of\r\nthe Orinoco and of the river Amazon, in every part of South America\r\nwhich I have explored, in the plains as well as on the coldest\r\ntable-lands, the Indian children of two or three months old have\r\nthe same bronze tint as is observed in adults. The idea that the\r\nnatives may be whites tanned by the air and the sun, could never\r\nhave occurred to a Spanish inhabitant of Quito, or of the banks of\r\nthe Orinoco. In the north-east of America, on the contrary, we meet\r\nwith tribes among whom the children are white, and at the age of\r\nvirility they acquire the bronze colour of the natives of Mexico\r\nand Peru. Michikinakoua, chief of the Miamis, had his arms, and\r\nthose parts of his body not exposed to the sun, almost white. This\r\ndifference of hue between the parts covered and not covered is\r\nnever observed among the natives of Peru and Mexico, even in\r\nfamilies who live much at their ease, and remain almost constantly\r\nwithin doors. To the west of the Miamis, on the coast opposite to\r\nAsia, among the Kolouches and Tchinkitans* of Norfolk Sound (*\r\nBetween 54 and 58 degrees of latitude. These white nations have\r\nbeen visited successively by Portlock, Marchand, Baranoff, and\r\nDavidoff. The Tchinkitans, or Schinkit, are the inhabitants of the\r\nisland of Sitka. Vater Mithridates volume 3 page 2. Marchand\r\nVoyages volume 2.), grown-up girls, when they have gashed their\r\nskin, display the white hue of Europeans. This whiteness is found\r\nalso, according to some accounts, among the mountaineers of Chile.*\r\n(* Molina, Saggio sull' Istoria Nat. del Chile edition 2 page 293.\r\nMay we believe the existence of those blue eyes of the Boroas of\r\nChile and Guayanas of Uruguay; represented to us as nations of the\r\nrace of Odin? Azara Voyage tome 2.)\r\n\r\nThese facts are very remarkable, and contrary to the opinion so\r\ngenerally spread, of the extreme conformity of organization among\r\nthe natives of America. If we divide them into Esquimaux and\r\nnon-Esquimaux, we readily admit that this classification is not\r\nmore philosophical than that of the ancients, who saw in the whole\r\nof the habitable world only Celts and Scythians, Greeks, and\r\nBarbarians. When, however, our purpose is to group numerous\r\nnations, we gain something by proceeding in the mode of exclusion.\r\nAll we have sought to establish here is, that, in separating the\r\nwhole race of Tschougaz-Esquimaux, there remain still, among the\r\ncoppery-brown Americans, other races, the children of which are\r\nborn white, without our being able to prove, by going back as far\r\nas the history of the Conquest, that they have been mingled with\r\nEuropean blood. This fact deserves to be cleared up by travellers\r\nwho may possess a knowledge of physiology, and may have\r\nopportunities of examining the brown children of the Mexicans at\r\nthe age of two years, as well as the white children of the Miamis,\r\nand those hordes* on the Orinoco (* These whitish tribes are the\r\nGuaycas, the Ojos, and the Maquiritares.), who, living in the most\r\nsultry regions, retain during their whole life, and in the fulness\r\nof their strength, the whitish skin of the Mestizoes.\r\n\r\nIn man, the deviations from the common type of the whole race are\r\napparent in the stature, the physiognomy, or the form of the body,\r\nrather than on the colour of the skin.* (* The circumpolar nations\r\nof the two continents are small and squat, though of races entirely\r\ndifferent.) It is not so with animals, where varieties are found\r\nmore in colour than in form. The hair of the mammiferous class of\r\nanimals, the feathers of birds, and even the scales of fishes,\r\nchange their hue, according to the lengthened influence of light\r\nand darkness, and the intensity of heat and cold. In man, the\r\ncolouring matter seems to be deposited in the epidermis by the\r\nroots or the bulbs of the hair:* (* Adverting to the interesting\r\nresearches of M. Gaultier, on the organisation of the human skin,\r\nJohn Hunter observes, that in several animals the colorating of the\r\nhair is independent of that of the skin.) and all sound\r\nobservations prove, that the skin varies in colour from the action\r\nof external stimuli on individuals, and not hereditarily in the\r\nwhole race. The Esquimaux of Greenland and the Laplanders are\r\ntanned by the influence of the air; but their children are born\r\nwhite. We will not decide on the changes which nature may have\r\nproduced in a space of time exceeding all historical tradition.\r\nReason stops short in these matters, when no longer under the\r\nguidance of experience and analogy.\r\n\r\nAll white-skinned nations begin their cosmogony by white men; they\r\nallege that the negroes and all tawny people have been blackened or\r\nembrowned by the excessive heat of the sun. This theory, adopted by\r\nthe Greeks,* (* Strabo, liv. 15.) though it did not pass without\r\ncontradiction,* (* Onesicritus, apud Strabonem, lib. 15.\r\nAlexander's expedition appears to have contributed greatly to fix\r\nthe attention of the Greeks on the great question of the influence\r\nof climates. They had learned from the accounts of travellers, that\r\nin Hindostan the nations of the south were of darker colour than\r\nthose of the north, near the mountains: and they supposed that they\r\nwere both of the same race.) has been propagated even to our own\r\ntimes. Buffon has repeated in prose what Theodectes had expressed\r\nin verse two thousand years before: \"that nations wear the livery\r\nof the climate in which they live.\" If history had been written by\r\nblack nations, they would have maintained what even Europeans have\r\nrecently advanced,* that man was originally black, or of a very\r\ntawny colour (* See the work of Mr. Prichard, abounding with\r\ncurious research. \"Researches into the Physical History of Man,\r\n1813,\" page 239.); and that mankind have become white in some\r\nraces, from the effect of civilization and progressive\r\ndebilitation, as animals, in a state of domestication, pass from\r\ndark to lighter colours. In plants and in animals, accidental\r\nvarieties, formed under our own eyes, have become fixed, and have\r\nbeen propagated;* (* For example, the sheep with very short legs,\r\ncalled ancon sheep in Connecticut, and examined by Sir Everard\r\nHome. This variety dates only from the year 1791.) but nothing\r\nproves, that in the present state of human organization, the\r\ndifferent races of black, yellow, copper-coloured, and white men,\r\nwhen they remain unmixed, deviate considerably from their primitive\r\ntype, by the influence of climate, of food, and other external\r\nagents.\r\n\r\nThese opinions are founded on the authority of Ulloa.* (* \"The\r\nIndians [Americans] are of a copper-colour, which by the action of\r\nthe sun and the air grows darker. I must remark, that neither heat\r\nnor cold produces any sensible change in the colour, so that the\r\nIndians of the Cordilleras of Peru are easily confounded with those\r\nof the hottest plains; and those who live under the Line cannot be\r\ndistinguished, by their colour, from those who inhabit the fortieth\r\ndegree of north and south latitude.\"--Noticias Americanas. No\r\nancient author has so clearly stated the two forms of reasoning, by\r\nwhich we still explain in our days the differences of colour and\r\nfeatures among neighbouring nations, as Tacitus. He makes a just\r\ndistinction between the influence of climate, and hereditary\r\ndispositions; and, like a philosopher persuaded of our profound\r\nignorance of the origin of things, he leaves the question\r\nundecided. \"Habitus corporum varii; atque ex eo argumenta, seu\r\ndurante originis vi, seu procurrentibus in diversa terris, positio\r\ncoeli corporibus habitum dedit.\"--Agricola, cap 2.) That learned\r\nwriter saw the Indians of Chile, of the Andes of Peru, of the\r\nburning coasts of Panama, and those of Louisiana, situated in the\r\nnorthern temperate zone. He had the good fortune to live at a\r\nperiod when theories were less numerous; and, like me, he was\r\nstruck by seeing the natives equally bronzed under the Line, in the\r\ncold climate of the Cordilleras, and in the plains. Where\r\ndifferences of colour are observed, they depend on the race. We\r\nshall soon find on the burning banks of the Orinoco Indians with a\r\nwhitish skin. Durans originis vis est.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.10.\r\n\r\nSECOND ABODE AT CUMANA.\r\nEARTHQUAKES.\r\nEXTRAORDINARY METEORS.\r\n\r\nWe remained a month longer at Cumana, employing ourselves in the\r\nnecessary preparations for our proposed visit to the Orinoco and\r\nthe Rio Negro. We had to choose such instruments as could be most\r\neasily transported in narrow boats; and to engage guides for an\r\ninland journey of ten months, across a country without\r\ncommunication with the coasts. The astronomical determination of\r\nplaces being the most important object of this undertaking, I felt\r\ndesirous not to miss the observation of an eclipse of the sun,\r\nwhich was to be visible at the end of October: and in consequence I\r\npreferred remaining till that period at Cumana, where the sky is\r\ngenerally clear and serene. It was now too late to reach the banks\r\nof the Orinoco before October; and the high valleys of Caracas\r\npromised less favourable opportunities, on account of the vapours\r\nwhich accumulate round the neighbouring mountains.\r\n\r\nI was, however, near being compelled by a deplorable occurrence, to\r\nrenounce, or at least to delay for a long time, my journey to the\r\nOrinoco. On the 27th of October, the day before the eclipse, we\r\nwent as usual, to take the air on the shore of the gulf, and to\r\nobserve the instant of high water, which in those parts is only\r\ntwelve or thirteen inches. It was eight in the evening, and the\r\nbreeze was not yet stirring. The sky was cloudy; and during a dead\r\ncalm it was excessively hot. We crossed the beach which separates\r\nthe suburb of the Guayqueria Indians from the embarcadero. I heard\r\nsome one walking behind us, and on turning, I saw a tall man of the\r\ncolour of the Zambos, naked to the waist. He held almost over my\r\nhead a macana, which is a great stick of palm-tree wood, enlarged\r\nto the end like a club. I avoided the stroke by leaping towards the\r\nleft; but M. Bonpland, who walked on my right, was less fortunate.\r\nHe did not see the Zambo so soon as I did, and received a stroke\r\nabove the temple, which levelled him with the ground. We were\r\nalone, without arms, half a league from any habitation, on a vast\r\nplain bounded by the sea. The Zambo, instead of attacking me, moved\r\noff slowly to pick up M. Bonpland's hat, which, having somewhat\r\ndeadened the violence of the blow, had fallen off and lay at some\r\ndistance. Alarmed at seeing my companion on the ground, and for\r\nsome moments senseless, I thought of him only. I helped him to\r\nraise himself, and pain and anger doubled his strength. We ran\r\ntoward the Zambo, who, either from cowardice, common enough in\r\npeople of this caste, or because he perceived at a distance some\r\nmen on the beach, did not wait for us, but ran off in the direction\r\nof the Tunal, a little thicket of cactus and arborescent avicennia.\r\nHe chanced to fall in running; and M. Bonpland, who reached him\r\nfirst, seized him round the body. The Zambo drew a long knife; and\r\nin this unequal struggle we should infallibly have been wounded, if\r\nsome Biscayan merchants, who were taking the air on the beach, had\r\nnot come to our assistance. The Zambo seeing himself surrounded,\r\nthought no longer of defence. He again ran away, and we pursued him\r\nthrough the thorny cactuses. At length, tired out, he took shelter\r\nin a cow-house, whence he suffered himself to be quietly led to\r\nprison.\r\n\r\nM. Bonpland was seized with fever during the night; but being\r\nendowed with great energy and fortitude, and possessing that\r\ncheerful disposition which is one of the most precious gifts of\r\nnature, he continued his labours the next day. The stroke of the\r\nmacana had extended to the top of his head, and he felt its effect\r\nfor the space of two or three months during the stay we made at\r\nCaracas. When stooping to collect plants, he was sometimes seized\r\nwith giddiness, which led us to fear that an internal abscess was\r\nforming. Happily these apprehensions were unfounded, and the\r\nsymptoms, at first alarming, gradually disappeared. The inhabitants\r\nof Cumana showed us the kindest interest. It was ascertained that\r\nthe Zambo was a native of one of the Indian villages which surround\r\nthe great lake of Maracaybo. He had served on board a privateer\r\nbelonging to the island of St. Domingo, and in consequence of a\r\nquarrel with the captain he had been left on the coast of Cumana,\r\nwhen the ship quitted the port. Having seen the signal which we had\r\nfixed up for the purpose of observing the height of the tides, he\r\nhad watched the moment when he could attack us on the beach. But\r\nwhy, after having knocked one of us down, was he satisfied with\r\nsimply stealing a hat? In an examination he underwent, his answers\r\nwere so confused and stupid, that it was impossible to clear up our\r\ndoubts. Sometimes he maintained that his intention was not to rob\r\nus; but that, irritated by the bad treatment he had suffered on\r\nboard the privateer of St. Domingo, he could not resist the desire\r\nof attacking us, when he heard us speak French. Justice is so tardy\r\nin this country, that prisoners, of whom the jail is full, may\r\nremain seven or eight years without being brought to trial; we\r\nlearnt, therefore, with some satisfaction, that a few days after\r\nour departure from Cumana, the Zambo had succeeded in breaking out\r\nof the castle of San Antonio.\r\n\r\nOn the day after this occurrence, the 28th of October, I was, at\r\nfive in the morning, on the terrace of our house, making\r\npreparations for the observation of the eclipse. The weather was\r\nfine and serene. The crescent of Venus, and the constellation of\r\nthe Ship, so splendid from the disposition of its immense nebulae,\r\nwere lost in the rays of the rising sun. I had a complete\r\nobservation of the progress and the close of the eclipse. I\r\ndetermined the distance of the horns, or the differences of\r\naltitude and azimuth, by the passage over the threads of the\r\nquadrant. The eclipse terminated at 2 hours 14 minutes 23.4 seconds\r\nmean time, at Cumana.\r\n\r\nDuring a few days which preceded and followed the eclipse of the\r\nsun, very remarkable atmospherical phenomena were observable. It\r\nwas what is called in those countries the season of winter; that\r\nis, of clouds and small electrical showers. From the 10th of\r\nOctober to the 3rd of November, at nightfall, a reddish vapour\r\narose in the horizon, and covered, in a few minutes, with a veil\r\nmore or less thick, the azure vault of the sky. Saussure's\r\nhygrometer, far from indicating greater humidity, often went back\r\nfrom 90 to 83 degrees. The heat of the day was from 28 to 32\r\ndegrees, which for this part of the torrid zone is very\r\nconsiderable. Sometimes, in the midst of the night, the vapours\r\ndisappeared in an instant; and at the moment when I had arranged my\r\ninstruments, clouds of brilliant whiteness collected at the zenith,\r\nand extended towards the horizon. On the 18th of October these\r\nclouds were so remarkably transparent, that they did not hide stars\r\neven of the fourth magnitude. I could distinguish so perfectly the\r\nspots of the moon, that it might have been supposed its disk was\r\nbefore the clouds. The latter were at a prodigious height, disposed\r\nin bands, and at equal distances, as from the effect of electric\r\nrepulsions:--these small masses of vapour, similar to those I saw\r\nabove my head on the ridge of the highest Andes, are, in several\r\nlanguages, designated by the name of sheep. When the reddish vapour\r\nspreads lightly over the sky, the great stars, which in general, at\r\nCumana, scarcely scintillate below 20 or 25 degrees, did not retain\r\neven at the zenith, their steady and planetary light. They\r\nscintillated at all altitudes, as after a heavy storm of rain.* (*\r\nI have not observed any direct relation between the scintillation\r\nof the stars and the dryness of that part of the atmosphere open to\r\nour researches. I have often seen at Cumana a great scintillation\r\nof the stars of Orion and Sagittarius, when Saussure's hygrometer\r\nwas at 85 degrees. At other times, these same stars, considerably\r\nelevated above the horizon, emitted a steady and planetary light,\r\nthe hygrometer being at 90 or 93 degrees. Probably it is not the\r\nquantity of vapour, but the manner in which it is diffused, and\r\nmore or less dissolved in the air, which determines the\r\nscintillation. The latter is invariably attended with a coloration\r\nof light. It is remarkable enough, that, in northern countries, at\r\na time when the atmosphere appears perfectly dry, the scintillation\r\nis most decided in very cold weather.) It was curious that the\r\nvapour did not affect the hygrometer at the surface of the earth. I\r\nremained a part of the night seated in a balcony, from which I had\r\na view of a great part of the horizon. In every climate I feel a\r\npeculiar interest in fixing my eyes, when the sky is serene, on\r\nsome great constellation, and seeing groups of vesicular vapours\r\nappear and augment, as around a central nucleus, then,\r\ndisappearing, form themselves anew.\r\n\r\nAfter the 28th of October, the reddish mist became thicker than it\r\nhad previously been. The heat of the nights seemed stifling, though\r\nthe thermometer rose only to 26 degrees. The breeze, which\r\ngenerally refreshed the air from eight or nine o'clock in the\r\nevening, was no longer felt. The atmosphere was burning hot, and\r\nthe parched and dusty ground was cracked on every side. On the 4th\r\nof November, about two in the afternoon, large clouds of peculiar\r\nblackness enveloped the high mountains of the Brigantine and the\r\nTataraqual. They extended by degrees as far as the zenith. About\r\nfour in the afternoon thunder was heard over our heads, at an\r\nimmense height, not regularly rolling, but with a hollow and often\r\ninterrupted sound. At the moment of the strongest electric\r\nexplosion, at 4 hours 12 minutes, there were two shocks of\r\nearthquake, which followed each other at the interval of fifteen\r\nseconds. The people ran into the streets, uttering loud cries. M.\r\nBonpland, who was leaning over a table examining plants, was almost\r\nthrown on the floor. I felt the shock very strongly, though I was\r\nlying in a hammock. Its direction was from north to south, which is\r\nrare at Cumana. Slaves, who were drawing water from a well more\r\nthan eighteen or twenty feet deep, near the river Manzanares, heard\r\na noise like the explosion of a strong charge of gunpowder. The\r\nnoise seemed to come from the bottom of the well; a very curious\r\nphenomenon, though very common in most of the countries of America\r\nwhich are exposed to earthquakes.\r\n\r\nA few minutes before the first shock there was a very violent blast\r\nof wind, followed by electrical rain falling in great drops. I\r\nimmediately tried the atmospherical electricity by the electrometer\r\nof Volta. The small balls separated four lines; the electricity\r\noften changed from positive to negative, as is the case during\r\nstorms, and, in the north of Europe, even sometimes in a fall of\r\nsnow. The sky remained cloudy, and the blast of wind was followed\r\nby a dead calm, which lasted all night. The sunset presented a\r\npicture of extraordinary magnificence. The thick veil of clouds was\r\nrent asunder, as in shreds, quite near the horizon; the sun\r\nappeared at 12 degrees of altitude on a sky of indigo-blue. Its\r\ndisk was enormously enlarged, distorted, and undulated toward the\r\nedges. The clouds were gilded; and fascicles of divergent rays,\r\nreflecting the most brilliant rainbow hues, extended over the\r\nheavens. A great crowd of people assembled in the public square.\r\nThis celestial phenomenon,--the earthquake,--the thunder which\r\naccompanied it,--the red vapour seen during so many days, all were\r\nregarded as the effect of the eclipse.\r\n\r\nAbout nine in the evening there was another shock, much slighter\r\nthan the former, but attended with a subterraneous noise. The\r\nbarometer was a little lower than usual; but the progress of the\r\nhorary variations or small atmospheric tides, was no way\r\ninterrupted. The mercury was precisely at the minimum of height at\r\nthe moment of the earthquake; it continued rising till eleven in\r\nthe evening, and sank again till half after four in the morning,\r\nconformably to the law which regulates barometrical variations. In\r\nthe night between the 3rd and 4th of November the reddish vapour\r\nwas so thick that I could not distinguish the situation of the\r\nmoon, except by a beautiful halo of 20 degrees diameter.\r\n\r\nScarcely twenty-two months had elapsed since the town of Cumana had\r\nbeen almost totally destroyed by an earthquake. The people regard\r\nvapours which obscure the horizon, and the subsidence of wind\r\nduring the night, as infallible pregnostics of disaster. We had\r\nfrequent visits from persons who wished to know whether our\r\ninstruments indicated new shocks for the next day; and alarm was\r\ngreat and general when, on the 5th of November, exactly at the same\r\nhour as on the preceding day, there was a violent gust of wind,\r\nattended by thunder, and a few drops of rain. No shock was felt.\r\nThe wind and storm returned during five or six days at the same\r\nhour, almost at the same minute. The inhabitants of Cumana, and of\r\nmany other places between the tropics, have long since observed\r\nthat atmospherical changes, which are, to appearance, the most\r\naccidental, succeed each other for whole weeks with astonishing\r\nregularity. The same phenomenon occurs in summer, in the temperate\r\nzone; nor has it escaped the perception of astronomers, who often\r\nobserve, in a serene sky, during three or four days successively,\r\nclouds which have collected at the same part of the firmament, take\r\nthe same direction, and dissolve at the same height; sometimes\r\nbefore, sometimes after the passage of a star over the meridian,\r\nconsequently within a few minutes of the same point of true time.*\r\n(* M. Arago and I paid a great deal of attention to this phenomenon\r\nduring a long series of observations made in the year 1809 and\r\n1810, at the Observatory of Paris, with the view of verifying the\r\ndeclination of the stars.)\r\n\r\nThe earthquake of the 4th of November, the first I had felt, made\r\nthe greater impression on me, as it was accompanied with remarkable\r\nmeteorological variations. It was, moreover, a positive movement\r\nupward and downward, and not a shock by undulation. I did not then\r\nimagine, that after a long abode on the table-lands of Quito and\r\nthe coasts of Peru, I should become almost as familiar with the\r\nabrupt movements of the ground as we are in Europe with the sound\r\nof thunder. In the city of Quito, we never thought of rising from\r\nour beds when, during the night, subterraneous rumblings\r\n(bramidos), which seem always to come from the volcano of\r\nPichincha, announced a shock, the force of which, however, is\r\nseldom in proportion to the intensity of the noise. The\r\nindifference of the inhabitants, who bear in mind that for three\r\ncenturies past their city has not been destroyed, readily\r\ncommunicates itself to the least intrepid traveller. It is not so\r\nmuch the fear of the danger, as the novelty of the sensation, which\r\nmakes so forcible an impression when the effect of the slightest\r\nearthquake is felt for the first time.\r\n\r\nFrom our infancy, the idea of certain contrasts becomes fixed in\r\nour minds: water appears to us an element that moves; earth, a\r\nmotionless and inert mass. These impressions are the result of\r\ndaily experience; they are connected with everything that is\r\ntransmitted to us by the senses. When the shock of an earthquake is\r\nfelt, when the earth which we had deemed so stable is shaken on its\r\nold foundations, one instant suffices to destroy long-fixed\r\nillusions. It is like awakening from a dream; but a painful\r\nawakening. We feel that we have been deceived by the apparent\r\nstability of nature; we become observant of the least noise; we\r\nmistrust for the first time the soil we have so long trod with\r\nconfidence. But if the shocks be repeated, if they become frequent\r\nduring several successive days, the uncertainty quickly disappears.\r\nIn 1784, the inhabitants of Mexico were accustomed to hear the\r\nthunder roll beneath their feet,* (* Los bramidos de Guanazuato.)\r\nas it is heard by us in the region of the clouds. Confidence easily\r\nsprings up in the human breast: on the coasts of Peru we become\r\naccustomed to the undulations of the ground, as the sailor becomes\r\naccustomed to the tossing of the ship, caused by the motion of the\r\nwaves.\r\n\r\nThe reddish vapour which at Cumana had spread a mist over the\r\nhorizon a little before sunset, disappeared after the 7th of\r\nNovember. The atmosphere resumed its former purity, and the\r\nfirmament appeared, at the zenith, of that deep blue tint peculiar\r\nto climates where heat, light, and a great equality of electric\r\ncharge seem all to promote the most perfect dissolution of water in\r\nthe air. I observed, on the night of the 7th, the immersion of the\r\nsecond satellite of Jupiter. The belts of the planet were more\r\ndistinct than I had ever seen them before.\r\n\r\nI passed a part of the night in comparing the intensity of the\r\nlight emitted by the beautiful stars which shine in the southern\r\nsky. I pursued this task carefully in both hemispheres, at sea, and\r\nduring my abode at Lima, at Guayaquil, and at Mexico. Nearly half a\r\ncentury has now elapsed since La Caille examined that region of the\r\nsky which is invisible in Europe. The stars near the south pole are\r\nusually observed with so little perseverance and attention, that\r\nthe greatest changes may take place in the intensity of their light\r\nand their own motion, without astronomers having the slightest\r\nknowledge of them. I think I have remarked changes of this kind in\r\nthe constellation of the Crane and in that of the Ship. I compared,\r\nat first with the naked eye, the stars which are not very distant\r\nfrom each other, for the purpose of classing them according to the\r\nmethod pointed out by Herschel, in a paper read to the Royal\r\nSociety of London in 1796. I afterwards employed diaphragms\r\ndiminishing the aperture of the telescope, and coloured and\r\ncolourless glasses placed before the eye-glass. I moreover made use\r\nof an instrument of reflexion calculated to bring simultaneously\r\ntwo stars into the field of the telescope, after having equalized\r\ntheir light by receiving it with more or fewer rays at pleasure,\r\nreflected by the silvered part of the mirror. I admit that these\r\nphotometric processes are not very precise; but I believe the last,\r\nwhich perhaps had never before been employed, might he rendered\r\nnearly exact, by adding a scale of equal parts to the moveable\r\nframe of the telescope of the sextant. It was by taking the mean of\r\na great number of valuations, that I saw the relative intensity of\r\nthe light of the great stars decrease in the following manner:\r\nSirius, Canopus, a Centauri, Acherner, b Centauri, Fomalhaut,\r\nRigel, Procyon, Betelgueuse, e of the Great Dog, d of the Great\r\nDog, a of the Crane, a of the Peacock. These experiments will\r\nbecome more interesting when travellers shall have determined anew,\r\nat intervals of forty or fifty years, some of those changes which\r\nthe celestial bodies seem to undergo, either at their surface or\r\nwith respect to their distances from our planetary system.\r\n\r\nAfter having made astronomical observations with the same\r\ninstruments, in our northern climates and in the torrid zone, we\r\nare surprised at the effect produced in the latter (by the\r\ntransparency of the air, and the less extinction of light), on the\r\nclearness with which the double stars, the satellites of Jupiter,\r\nor certain nebulae, present themselves. Beneath a sky equally\r\nserene in appearance, it would seem as if more perfect instruments\r\nwere employed; so much more distinct and well defined do the\r\nobjects appear between the tropics. It cannot be doubted, that at\r\nthe period when equinoctial America shall become the centre of\r\nextensive civilization, physical astronomy will make immense\r\nimprovements, in proportion as the skies will be explored with\r\nexcellent glasses, in the dry and hot climates of Cumana, Coro, and\r\nthe island of Margareta. I do not here mention the ridge of the\r\nCordilleras, because, with the exception of some high and nearly\r\nbarren plains in Mexico and Peru, the very elevated table-lands, in\r\nwhich the barometric pressure is from ten to twelve inches less\r\nthan at the level of the sea, have a misty and extremely variable\r\nclimate. The extreme purity of the atmosphere which constantly\r\nprevails in the low regions during the dry season, counterbalances\r\nthe elevation of site and the rarity of the air on the table-lands.\r\nThe elevated strata of the atmosphere, when they envelope the\r\nridges of mountains, undergo rapid changes in their transparency.\r\n\r\nThe night of the 11th of November was cool and extremely fine. From\r\nhalf after two in the morning, the most extraordinary luminous\r\nmeteors were seen in the direction of the east. M. Bonpland, who\r\nhad risen to enjoy the freshness of the air, perceived them first.\r\nThousands of bolides and falling stars succeeded each other during\r\nthe space of four hours. Their direction was very regular from\r\nnorth to south. They filled a space in the sky extending from due\r\neast 30 degrees to north and south. In an amplitude of 60 degrees\r\nthe meteors were seen to rise above the horizon at east-north-east\r\nand at east, to describe arcs more or less extended, and to fall\r\ntowards the south, after having followed the direction of the\r\nmeridian. Some of them attained a height of 40 degrees, and all\r\nexceeded 25 or 30 degrees. There was very little wind in the low\r\nregions of the atmosphere, and that little blew from the east. No\r\ntrace of clouds was to be seen. M. Bonpland states that, from the\r\nfirst appearance of the phenomenon, there was not in the firmament\r\na space equal in extent to three diameters of the moon, which was\r\nnot filled every instant with bolides and falling stars. The first\r\nwere fewer in number, but as they were of different sizes, it was\r\nimpossible to fix the limit between these two classes of phenomena.\r\nAll these meteors left luminous traces from five to ten degrees in\r\nlength, as often happens in the equinoctial regions. The\r\nphosphorescence of these traces, or luminous bands, lasted seven or\r\neight seconds. Many of the falling stars had a very distinct\r\nnucleus, as large as the disk of Jupiter, from which darted sparks\r\nof vivid light. The bolides seem to burst as by explosion; but the\r\nlargest, those from 1 to 1 degree 15 minutes in diameter,\r\ndisappeared without scintillation, leaving behind them\r\nphosphorescent bands (trabes) exceeding in breadth fifteen or\r\ntwenty minutes. The light of these meteors was white, and not\r\nreddish, which must doubtless be attributed to the absence of\r\nvapour and the extreme transparency of the air. For the same\r\nreason, within the tropics, the stars of the first magnitude have,\r\nat their rising, a light decidedly whiter than in Europe.\r\n\r\nAlmost all the inhabitants of Cumana witnessed this phenomenon,\r\nbecause they had left their houses before four o'clock, to attend\r\nthe early morning mass. They did not behold these bolides with\r\nindifference; the oldest among them remembered that the great\r\nearthquakes of 1766 were preceded by similar phenomena. The\r\nGuaiqueries in the Indian suburb alleged \"that the bolides began to\r\nappear at one o'clock; and that as they returned from fishing in\r\nthe gulf, they had perceived very small falling stars towards the\r\neast.\" They assured us that igneous meteors were extremely rare on\r\nthose coasts after two o'clock in the morning.\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon ceased by degrees after four o'clock, and the\r\nbolides and falling stars became less frequent; but we still\r\ndistinguished some to north-east by their whitish light, and the\r\nrapidity of their movement, a quarter of an hour after sunrise.\r\nThis circumstance will appear less extraordinary, when I mention\r\nthat in broad daylight, in 1788, the interior of the houses in the\r\ntown of Popayan was brightly illumined by an aerolite of immense\r\nmagnitude. It passed over the town, when the sun was shining\r\nclearly, about one o'clock. M. Bonpland and myself, during our\r\nsecond residence at Cumana, after having observed, on the 26th of\r\nSeptember, 1800, the immersion of the first satellite of Jupiter,\r\nsucceeded in seeing the planet distinctly with the naked eye,\r\neighteen minutes after the disk of the sun had appeared in the\r\nhorizon. There was a very slight vapour in the east, but Jupiter\r\nappeared on an azure sky. These facts bear evidence of the extreme\r\npurity and transparency of the atmosphere in the torrid zone. The\r\nmass of diffused light is the less, in proportion as the vapours\r\nare more perfectly dissolved. The same cause which checks the\r\ndiffusion of the solar light, diminishes the extinction of that\r\nwhich emanates either from bolides from Jupiter, or from the moon,\r\nseen on the second day after its conjunction. The 12th of November\r\nwas an extremely hot day, and the hygrometer indicated a very\r\nconsiderable degree of dryness for those climates. The reddish\r\nvapour clouded the horizon anew, and rose to the height of 14\r\ndegrees. This was the last time it appeared that year; and I must\r\nhere observe, that it is no less rare under the fine sky of Cumana,\r\nthan it is common at Acapulco, on the western coast of Mexico.\r\n\r\nWe did not neglect, during the course of our journey from Caracas\r\nto the Rio Negro, to enquire everywhere, whether the meteors of the\r\n12th of November had been perceived. In a wild country, where the\r\ngreater number of the inhabitants sleep in the open air, so\r\nextraordinary a phenomenon could not fail to be remarked, unless it\r\nhad been concealed from observation by clouds. The Capuchin\r\nmissionary at San Fernando de Apure,* (* North latitude 7 degrees\r\n53 minutes 12 seconds; west longitude 70 degrees 20 minutes.), a\r\nvillage situated amid the savannahs of the province of Varinas; the\r\nFranciscan monks stationed near the cataracts of the Orinoco and at\r\nMaroa,* (* North latitude 2 degrees 42 minutes 0 seconds; west\r\nlongitude 70 degrees 21 minutes.) on the banks of the Rio Negro;\r\nhad seen numberless falling-stars and bolides illumine the heavens.\r\nMaroa is south-west of Cumana, at one hundred and seventy-four\r\nleagues distance. All these observers compared the phenomenon to\r\nbrilliant fireworks; and it lasted from three till six in the\r\nmorning. Some of the monks had marked the day in their rituals;\r\nothers had noted it by the proximate festivals of the Church.\r\nUnfortunately, none of them could recollect the direction of the\r\nmeteors, or their apparent height. From the position of the\r\nmountains and thick forests which surround the Missions of the\r\nCataracts and the little village of Maroa, I presume that the\r\nbolides were still visible at 20 degrees above the horizon. On my\r\narrival at the southern extremity of Spanish Guiana, at the little\r\nfort of San Carlos, I found some Portuguese, who had gone up the\r\nRio Negro from the Mission of St. Joseph of the Maravitans. They\r\nassured me that in that part of Brazil the phenomenon had been\r\nperceived at least as far as San Gabriel das Cachoeiras,\r\nconsequently as far as the equator itself.* (* A little to the\r\nnorth-west of San Antonio de Castanheiro. I did not meet with any\r\npersons who had observed this meteor, at Santa Fe de Bogota, at\r\nPopayan, or in the southern hemisphere, at Quito and Peru. Perhaps\r\nthe state of the atmosphere, so changeable in these western regions,\r\nprevented observation.)\r\n\r\nI was forcibly struck by the immense height which these bolides\r\nmust have attained, to have rendered them visible simultaneously at\r\nCumana, and on the frontiers of Brazil, in a line of two hundred\r\nand thirty leagues in length. But what was my astonishment, when,\r\non my return to Europe, I learned that the same phenomenon had been\r\nperceived on an extent of the globe of 64 degrees of latitude, and\r\n91 degrees of longitude; at the equator, in South America, at\r\nLabrador, and in Germany! I saw accidentally, during my passage\r\nfrom Philadelphia to Bordeaux,* (* In the Memoirs of the\r\nPennsylvanian Society.) the corresponding observation of Mr.\r\nEllicot (latitude 30 degrees 42); and upon my return from Naples to\r\nBerlin, I read the account of the Moravian missionaries among the\r\nEsquimaux, in the Bibliothek of Gottingen.\r\n\r\nThe following is a succinct enumeration of the facts:\r\n\r\nFirst. The fiery meteors were seen in the east, and the\r\neast-north-east, at 40 degrees of elevation, from 2 to 6 a.m. at\r\nCumana (latitude 10 degrees 27 minutes 52 seconds, longitude 66\r\ndegrees 30 minutes); at Porto Cabello (latitude 10 degrees 6\r\nminutes 52 seconds, longitude 67 degrees 5 minutes); and on the\r\nfrontiers of Brazil, near the equator, in longitude 70 degrees\r\nwest of the meridian of Paris.\r\n\r\nSecond. In French Guiana (latitude 4 degrees 56 minutes, longitude\r\n54 degrees 35 minutes) \"the northern part of the sky was suffused\r\nwith fire. Numberless falling-stars traversed the heavens during\r\nthe space of an hour and a half, and shed so vivid a light, that\r\nthose meteors might be compared to the blazing sheaves which shoot\r\nout from fireworks.\" The knowledge of this fact rests upon the\r\nhighly trustworthy testimony of the Count de Marbois, then living\r\nin exile at Cayenne, a victim to his love of justice and of\r\nrational, constitutional liberty.\r\n\r\nThird. Mr. Ellicot, astronomer to the United States, having\r\ncompleted his trigonometric operations for the rectification of the\r\nlimits on the Ohio, being on the 12th of November in the gulf of\r\nFlorida, in latitude 25 degrees, and longitude 81 degrees 50\r\nminutes, saw in all parts of the sky, \"as many meteors as stars,\r\nmoving in all directions. Some appeared to fall perpendicularly;\r\nand it was expected every minute that they would drop into the\r\nvessel.\" The same phenomenon was perceived upon the American\r\ncontinent as far as latitude 30 degrees 42 minutes.\r\n\r\nFourth. In Labrador, at Nain (latitude 56 degrees 55 minutes), and\r\nHoffenthal (latitude 58 degrees 4 minutes); in Greenland, at\r\nLichtenau (latitude 61 degrees 5 minutes), and at New Herrnhut\r\n(latitude 64 degrees 14 minutes, longitude 52 degrees 20 minutes);\r\nthe Esquimaux were terrified at the enormous quantity of bolides\r\nwhich fell during twilight at all points of the firmament, and some\r\nof which were said to be a foot broad.\r\n\r\nFifth. In Germany, Mr. Zeissing, vicar of Ittetsadt, near Weimar\r\n(latitude 50 degrees 59 minutes, longitude 9 degrees 1 minute\r\neast), perceived, on the 12th of November, between the hours of six\r\nand seven in the morning (half-past two at Cumana), some\r\nfalling-stars which shed a very white light. Soon after, in the\r\ndirection of south and south-west, luminous rays appeared from four\r\nto six feet long; they were reddish, and resembled the luminous\r\ntrack of a sky-rocket. During the morning twilight, between the\r\nhours of seven and eight, the sky, in the direction of south-west,\r\nwas observed from time to time to be brightly illumined by white\r\nlightning, running in serpentine lines along the horizon. At night\r\nthe cold increased and the barometer rose. It is very probable,\r\nthat the meteors might have been observed more to the east, in\r\nPoland and in Russia.* (* In Paris and in London the sky was\r\ncloudy. At Carlsruhe, before dawn, lightning was seen in the\r\nnorth-west and south-east. On the 13th of November a remarkable\r\nglare of light was seen at the same place in the south-east.)\r\n\r\nThe distance from Weimar to the Rio Negro is 1800 nautical leagues;\r\nand from the Rio Negro to Herrnhut in Greenland, 1300 leagues.\r\nAdmitting that the same fiery meteors were seen at points so\r\ndistant from each other, we must suppose that their height was at\r\nleast 411 leagues. Near Weimar, the appearance like sky-rockets was\r\nobserved in the south and south-east; at Cumana, in the east and\r\neast-north-east. We may therefore conclude, that numberless\r\naerolites must have fallen into the sea, between Africa and South\r\nAmerica, westward of the Cape Verd Islands. But since the direction\r\nof the bolides was not the same at Labrador and at Cumana, why were\r\nthey not perceived in the latter place towards the north, as at\r\nCayenne? We can scarcely be too cautious on a subject, on which\r\ngood observations made in very distant places are still wanting. I\r\nam rather inclined to think, that the Chayma Indians of Cumana did\r\nnot see the same bolides as the Portuguese in Brazil and the\r\nmissionaries in Labrador; but at the same time it cannot be doubted\r\n(and this fact appears to me very remarkable) that in the New\r\nWorld, between the meridians of 46 and 82 degrees, between the\r\nequator and 64 degrees north, at the same hour, an immense number\r\nof bolides and falling-stars were perceived; and that those meteors\r\nhad everywhere the same brilliancy, throughout a space of 921,000\r\nsquare leagues.\r\n\r\nAstronomers who have lately been directing minute attention to\r\nfalling-stars and their parallaxes, consider them as meteors\r\nbelonging to the farthest limits of our atmosphere, between the\r\nregion of the Aurora Borealis and that of the lightest clouds.* (*\r\nAccording to the observations which I made on the ridge of the\r\nAndes, at an elevation of 2700 toises, on the moutons, or little\r\nwhite fleecy clouds, it appeared to me, that their elevation is\r\nsometimes not less than 6000 toises above the level of the coast.)\r\nSome have been seen, which had not more than 14,000 toises, or\r\nabout five leagues of elevation. The highest do not appear to\r\nexceed thirty leagues. They are often more than a hundred feet in\r\ndiameter: and their swiftness is such, that they dart in a few\r\nseconds through a space of two leagues. Of some which have been\r\nmeasured, the direction was almost perpendicularly upward, or\r\nforming an angle of 50 degrees with the vertical line. This\r\nextremely remarkable circumstance has led to the conclusion, that\r\nfalling-stars are not aerolites which, after having hovered a long\r\ntime in space, unite on accidentally entering into our atmosphere,\r\nand fall towards the earth.* (* M. Chladni, who at first considered\r\nfalling-stars to be aerolites, subsequently abandoned that idea.)\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the origin of these luminous meteors, it is\r\ndifficult to conceive an instantaneous inflammation taking place in\r\na region where there is less air than in the vacuum of our\r\nair-pumps; and where (at the height of 25,000 toises) the mercury\r\nin the barometer would not rise to 0.012 of a line. We have\r\nascertained the uniform mixture of atmospheric air to be about 0.\r\n003, only to an elevation of 3000 toises; consequently not beyond\r\nthe last stratum of fleecy clouds. It may be admitted that, in the\r\nfirst revolutions of the globe, gaseous substances, which yet\r\nremain unknown to us, have risen towards that region through which\r\nthe falling-stars pass; but accurate experiments, made upon\r\nmixtures of gases which have not the same specific gravity, show\r\nthat there is no reason for supposing a superior stratum of the\r\natmosphere entirely different from the inferior strata. Gaseous\r\nsubstances mingle and penetrate each other on the least movement;\r\nand a uniformity of their mixture may have taken place in the lapse\r\nof ages, unless we believe them to possess a repulsive action of\r\nwhich there is no example in those substances we can subject to our\r\nobservations. Farther, if we admit the existence of particular\r\naerial fluids in the inaccessible regions of luminous meteors, of\r\nfalling-stars, bolides, and the Aurora Borealis; how can we\r\nconceive why the whole stratum of those fluids does not at once\r\nignite, but that the gaseous emanations, like the clouds, occupy\r\nonly limited spaces? How can we suppose an electrical explosion\r\nwithout some vapours collected together, capable of containing\r\nunequal charges of electricity, in air, the mean temperature of\r\nwhich is perhaps 25 degrees below the freezing point of the\r\ncentigrade thermometer, and the rarefaction of which is so\r\nconsiderable, that the compression of the electrical shock could\r\nscarcely disengage any heat? These difficulties would in great part\r\nbe removed, if the direction of the movement of falling-stars\r\nallowed us to consider them as bodies with a solid nucleus, as\r\ncosmic phenomena (belonging to space beyond the limits of our\r\natmosphere), and not as telluric phenomena (belonging to our planet\r\nonly).\r\n\r\nSupposing the meteors of Cumana to have been only at the usual\r\nheight at which falling-stars in general move, the same meteors\r\nwere seen above the horizon in places more than 310 leagues distant\r\nfrom each other.* (* It was this circumstance that induced Lambert\r\nto propose the observation of falling-stars for the determination\r\nof terrestrial longitudes. He considered them to be celestial\r\nsignals seen at great distances.) How great a disposition to\r\nincandescence must have prevailed on the 12th November, in the\r\nhigher regions of the atmosphere, to have rendered during four\r\nhours myriads of bolides and falling stars visible at the equator,\r\nin Greenland, and in Germany!\r\n\r\nM. Benzenberg observes, that the same cause which renders the\r\nphenomenon more frequent, has also an influence on the large size\r\nof the meteors, and the intensity of their light. In Europe, the\r\ngreatest number of falling stars are seen on those nights on which\r\nvery bright ones are mingled with very small ones. The periodical\r\nnature of the phenomenon augments the interest it excites. There\r\nare months in which M. Brandes has reckoned in our temperate zone\r\nonly sixty or eighty falling-stars in one night; and in other\r\nmonths their number has risen to two thousand. Whenever one is\r\nobserved, which has the diameter of Sirius or of Jupiter, we are\r\nsure of seeing the brilliant meteor succeeded by a great number of\r\nsmaller ones. If the falling stars be very numerous during one\r\nnight, it is probable that they will continue equally so during\r\nseveral weeks. It would seem, that in the higher regions of the\r\natmosphere, near that extreme limit where the centrifugal force is\r\nbalanced by gravity, there exists at regular periods a particular\r\ndisposition for the production of bolides, falling-stars, and the\r\nAurora Borealis.* (* Ritter, like several others, makes a\r\ndistinction between bolides mingled with falling-stars and those\r\nluminous meteors which, enveloped in vapour and smoke, explode with\r\ngreat noise, and let fall (chiefly in the day-time) aerolites. The\r\nlatter certainly do not belong to our atmosphere.) Does the\r\nperiodical recurrence of this great phenomenon depend upon the\r\nstate of the atmosphere? or upon something which the atmosphere\r\nreceives from without, while the earth advances in the ecliptic? Of\r\nall this we are still as ignorant as mankind were in the days of\r\nAnaxagoras.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the falling-stars themselves, it appears to me,\r\nfrom my own experience, that they are more frequent in the\r\nequinoctial regions than in the temperate zone; and more frequent\r\nabove continents, and near certain coasts, than in the middle of\r\nthe ocean. Do the radiation of the surface of the globe, and the\r\nelectric charge of the lower regions of the atmosphere (which\r\nvaries according to the nature of the soil and the positions of the\r\ncontinents and seas), exert their influence as far as those heights\r\nwhere eternal winter reigns? The total absence of even the smallest\r\nclouds, at certain seasons, or above some barren plains destitute\r\nof vegetation, seems to prove that this influence can be felt as\r\nfar as five or six thousand toises high.\r\n\r\nA phenomenon analogous to that which appeared on the 12th of\r\nNovember at Cumana, was observed thirty years previously on the\r\ntable-land of the Andes, in a country studded with volcanoes. In\r\nthe city of Quito there was seen in one part of the sky, above the\r\nvolcano of Cayamba, such great numbers of falling-stars, that the\r\nmountain was thought to be in flames. This singular sight lasted\r\nmore than an hour. The people assembled in the plain of Exido,\r\nwhich commands a magnificent view of the highest summits of the\r\nCordilleras. A procession was on the point of setting out from the\r\nconvent of San Francisco, when it was perceived that the blaze on\r\nthe horizon was caused by fiery meteors, which ran along the skies\r\nin all directions, at the altitude of twelve or thirteen degrees.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.11.\r\n\r\nPASSAGE FROM CUMANA TO LA GUAYRA.\r\nMORRO OF NUEVA BARCELONA.\r\nCAPE CODERA.\r\nROAD FROM LA GUAYRA TO CARACAS.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of November, at eight in the evening, we were under\r\nsail to proceed along the coast from Cumana to the port of La\r\nGuayra, whence the inhabitants of the province of Venezuela export\r\nthe greater part of their produce. The passage is only a distance\r\nof sixty leagues, and it usually occupies from thirty-six to forty\r\nhours. The little coasting vessels are favoured at once by the wind\r\nand by the currents, which run with more or less force from east to\r\nwest, along the coasts of Terra Firma, particularly from cape Paria\r\nto the cape of Chichibacoa. The road by land from Cumana to New\r\nBarcelona, and thence to Caracas, is nearly in the same state as\r\nthat in which it was before the discovery of America. The traveller\r\nhas to contend with the obstacles presented by a miry soil, large\r\nscattered rocks, and strong vegetation. He must sleep in the open\r\nair, pass through the valleys of the Unare, the Tuy, and the\r\nCapaya, and cross torrents which swell rapidly on account of the\r\nproximity of the mountains. To these obstacles must be added the\r\ndangers arising from the extreme insalubrity of the country. The\r\nvery low lands, between the sea-shore and the chain of hills\r\nnearest the coast, from the bay of Mochima as far as Coro, are\r\nextremely unhealthy. But the last-mentioned town, which is\r\nsurrounded by an immense wood of thorny cactuses, owes its great\r\nsalubrity, like Cumana, to its barren soil and the absence of rain.\r\n\r\nIn returning from Caracas to Cumana, the road by land is sometimes\r\npreferred to the passage by sea, to avoid the adverse current. The\r\npostman from Caracas is nine days in performing this journey. We\r\noften saw persons, who had followed him, arrive at Cumana ill of\r\nnervous and miasmatic fevers. The tree of which the bark* furnishes\r\na salutary remedy for those fevers (* Cortex Angosturae of our\r\npharmacopaeias, the bark of the Bonplandia trifoliata.), grows in\r\nthe same valleys, and upon the edge of the same forests which send\r\nforth the pernicious exhalations. M. Bonpland recognised the\r\ncuspare in the vegetation of the gulf of Santa Fe, situated between\r\nthe ports of Cumana and Barcelona. The sickly traveller may\r\nperchance repose in a cottage, the inhabitants of which are\r\nignorant of the febrifuge qualities of the trees that shade the\r\nsurrounding valleys.\r\n\r\nHaving proceeded by sea from Cumana to La Guayra, we intended to\r\ntake up our abode in the town of Caracas, till the end of the rainy\r\nseason. From Caracas we proposed to direct our course across the\r\ngreat plains or llanos, to the Missions of the Orinoco; to go up\r\nthat vast river, to the south of the cataracts, as far as the Rio\r\nNegro and the frontiers of Brazil; and thence to return to Cumana\r\nby the capital of Spanish Guiana, commonly called, on account of\r\nits situation, Angostura, or the Strait. We could not determine the\r\ntime we might require to accomplish a tour of seven hundred\r\nleagues, more than two-thirds of that distance having to be\r\ntraversed in boats. The only parts of the Orinoco known on the\r\ncoasts are those near its mouth. No commercial intercourse is kept\r\nup with the Missions. The whole of the country beyond the llanos is\r\nunknown to the inhabitants of Cumana and Caracas. Some think that\r\nthe plains of Calabozo, covered with turf, stretch eight hundred\r\nleagues southward, communicating with the Steppes or Pampas of\r\nBuenos Ayres; others, recalling to mind the great mortality which\r\nprevailed among the troops of Iturriaga and Solano, during their\r\nexpedition to the Orinoco, consider the whole country, south of the\r\ncataracts of Atures, as extremely pernicious to health. In a region\r\nwhere travelling is so uncommon, people seem to feel a pleasure in\r\nexaggerating to strangers the difficulties arising from the\r\nclimate, the wild animals, and the Indians. Nevertheless we\r\npersisted in the project we had formed. We could rely upon the\r\ninterest and solicitude of the governor of Cumana, Don Vicente\r\nEmparan, as well as on the recommendations of the Franciscan monks,\r\nwho are in reality masters of the shores of the Orinoco.\r\n\r\nFortunately for us, one of those monks, Juan Gonzales, was at that\r\ntime in Cumana. This young monk, who was only a lay-brother, was\r\nhighly intelligent, and full of spirit and courage. He had the\r\nmisfortune shortly after his arrival on the coast to displease his\r\nsuperiors, upon the election of a new director of the Missions of\r\nPiritu, which is a period of great agitation in the convent of New\r\nBarcelona. The triumphant party exercised a general retaliation,\r\nfrom which the lay-brother could not escape. He was sent to\r\nEsmeralda, the last Mission of the Upper Orinoco, famous for the\r\nvast quantity of noxious insects with which the air is continually\r\nfilled. Fray Juan Gonzales was thoroughly acquainted with the\r\nforests which extend from the cataracts towards the sources of the\r\nOrinoco. Another revolution in the republican government of the\r\nmonks had some years before brought him to the coast, where he\r\nenjoyed (and most justly) the esteem of his superiors. He confirmed\r\nus in our desire of examining the much-disputed bifurcation of the\r\nOrinoco. He gave us useful advice for the preservation of our\r\nhealth, in climates where he had himself suffered long from\r\nintermitting fevers. We had the satisfaction of finding Fray Juan\r\nGonzales at New Barcelona, on our return from the Rio Negro.\r\nIntending to go from the Havannah to Cadiz, he obligingly offered\r\nto take charge of part of our herbals, and our insects of the\r\nOrinoco; but these collections were unfortunately lost with himself\r\nat sea. This excellent young man, who was much attached to us, and\r\nwhose zeal and courage might have rendered him very serviceable to\r\nthe missions of his order, perished in a storm on the coast of\r\nAfrica, in 1801.\r\n\r\nThe boat which conveyed us from Cumana to La Guayra, was one of\r\nthose employed in trading between the coasts and the West India\r\nIslands. They are thirty feet long, and not more than three feet\r\nhigh at the gunwale; they have no decks, and their burthen is\r\ngenerally from two hundred to two hundred and fifty quintals.\r\nAlthough the sea is extremely rough from Cape Codera to La Guayra,\r\nand although the boats have an enormous triangular sail, somewhat\r\ndangerous in those gusts which issue from the mountain-passes, no\r\ninstance has occurred during thirty years, of one of these boats\r\nbeing lost in the passage from Cumana to the coast of Caracas. The\r\nskill of the Guaiqueria pilots is so great, that accidents are very\r\nrare, even in the frequent trips they make from Cumana to\r\nGuadaloupe, or the Danish islands, which are surrounded with\r\nbreakers. These voyages of 120 or 150 leagues, in an open sea, out\r\nof sight of land, are performed in boats without decks, like those\r\nof the ancients, without observations of the meridian altitude of\r\nthe sun, without charts, and generally without a compass. The\r\nIndian pilot directs his course at night by the pole-star, and in\r\nthe daytime by the sun and the wind. I have seen Guaiqueries and\r\npilots of the Zambo caste, who could find the pole-star by the\r\ndirection of the pointers alpha and beta of the Great Bear, and\r\nthey seemed to me to steer less from the view of the pole-star\r\nitself, than from the line drawn through these stars. It is\r\nsurprising, that at the first sight of land, they can find the\r\nisland of Guadaloupe, Santa Cruz, or Porto Rico; but the\r\ncompensation of the errors of their course is not always equally\r\nfortunate. The boats, if they fall to leeward in making land, beat\r\nup with great difficulty to the eastward, against the wind and the\r\ncurrent.\r\n\r\nWe descended rapidly the little river Manzanares, the windings of\r\nwhich are marked by cocoa-trees, as the rivers of Europe are\r\nsometimes bordered by poplars and old willows. On the adjacent arid\r\nland, the thorny bushes, on which by day nothing is visible but\r\ndust, glitter during the night with thousands of luminous sparks.\r\nThe number of phosphorescent insects augments in the stormy season.\r\nThe traveller in the equinoctial regions is never weary of admiring\r\nthe effect of those reddish and moveable fires, which, being\r\nreflected by limpid water, blend their radiance with that of the\r\nstarry vault of heaven.\r\n\r\nWe quitted the shore of Cumana as if it had long been our home.\r\nThis was the first land we had trodden in a zone, towards which my\r\nthoughts had been directed from earliest youth. There is a powerful\r\ncharm in the impression produced by the scenery and climate of\r\nthese regions; and after an abode of a few months we seemed to have\r\nlived there during a long succession of years. In Europe, the\r\ninhabitant of the north feels an almost similar emotion, when he\r\nquits even after a short abode the shores of the Bay of Naples, the\r\ndelicious country between Tivoli and the lake of Nemi, or the wild\r\nand majestic scenery of the Upper Alps and the Pyrenees. Yet\r\neverywhere in the temperate zone, the effects of vegetable\r\nphysiognomy afford little contrast. The firs and the oaks which\r\ncrown the mountains of Sweden have a certain family air in common\r\nwith those which adorn Greece and Italy. Between the tropics, on\r\nthe contrary, in the lower regions of both Indies, everything in\r\nnature appears new and marvellous. In the open plains and amid the\r\ngloom of forests, almost all the remembrances of Europe are\r\neffaced; for it is vegetation that determines the character of a\r\nlandscape, and acts upon the imagination by its mass, the contrast\r\nof its forms, and the glow of its colours. In proportion as\r\nimpressions are powerful and new, they weaken antecedent\r\nimpressions, and their force imparts to them the character of\r\nduration. I appeal to those who, more sensible to the beauties of\r\nnature than to the charms of society, have long resided in the\r\ntorrid zone. How dear, how memorable during life, is the land on\r\nwhich they first disembarked! A vague desire to revisit that spot\r\nremains rooted in their minds to the most advanced age. Cumana and\r\nits dusty soil are still more frequently present to my imagination,\r\nthan all the wonders of the Cordilleras. Beneath the bright sky of\r\nthe south, the light, and the magic of the aerial hues, embellish a\r\nland almost destitute of vegetation. The sun does not merely\r\nenlighten, it colours the objects, and wraps them in a thin vapour,\r\nwhich, without changing the transparency of the air, renders its\r\ntints more harmonious, softens the effects of the light, and\r\ndiffuses over nature a placid calm, which is reflected in our\r\nsouls. To explain this vivid impression which the aspect of the\r\nscenery in the two Indies produces, even on coasts but thinly\r\nwooded, it is sufficient to recollect that the beauty of the sky\r\naugments from Naples to the equator, almost as much as from\r\nProvence to the south of Italy.\r\n\r\nWe passed at high water the bar formed at the mouth of the little\r\nriver Manzanares. The evening breeze gently swelled the waves in\r\nthe gulf of Cariaco. The moon had not risen, but that part of the\r\nmilky way which extends from the feet of the Centaur towards the\r\nconstellation of Sagittarius, seemed to pour a silvery light over\r\nthe surface of the ocean. The white rock, crowned by the castle of\r\nSan Antonio, appeared from time to time between the high tops of\r\nthe cocoa-trees which border the shore; and we soon recognized the\r\ncoasts only by the scattered lights of the Guaiqueria fishermen.\r\n\r\nWe sailed at first to north-north-west, approaching the peninsula\r\nof Araya; we then ran thirty miles to west and west-south-west. As\r\nwe advanced towards the shoal that surrounds Cape Arenas and\r\nstretches as far as the petroleum springs of Maniquarez, we enjoyed\r\none of those varied sights which the great phosphorescence of the\r\nsea so often displays in those climates. Bands of porpoises\r\nfollowed our bark. Fifteen or sixteen of these animals swam at\r\nequal distances from each other. When turning on their backs, they\r\nstruck the surface of the water with their broad tails; they\r\ndiffused a brilliant light, which seemed like flames issuing from\r\nthe depth of the ocean.* (* See Views of Nature Bohn's edition page\r\n246.) Each band of porpoises, ploughing the surface of the waters,\r\nleft behind it a track of light, the more striking as the rest of\r\nthe sea was not phosphorescent. As the motion of an oar, and the\r\ntrack of the bark, produced on that night but feeble sparks, it is\r\nnatural to suppose that the vivid phosphorescence caused by the\r\nporpoises was owing not only to the stroke of their tails, but also\r\nto the gelatinous matter that envelopes their bodies, and is\r\ndetached by the shock of the waves.\r\n\r\nWe found ourselves at midnight between some barren and rocky\r\nislands, which uprise like bastions in the middle of the sea, and\r\nform the group of the Caracas and Chimanas.* (* There are three of\r\nthe Caracas islands and eight of the Chimanas.) The moon was above\r\nthe horizon, and lighted up these cleft rocks which are bare of\r\nvegetation and of fantastic aspect. The sea here forms a sort of\r\nbay, a slight inward curve of the land between Cumana and Cape\r\nCodera. The islets of Picua, Picuita, Caracas, and Boracha, appear\r\nlike fragments of the ancient coast, which stretches from Bordones\r\nin the same direction east and west. The gulfs of Mochima and Santa\r\nFe, which will no doubt one day become frequented ports, lie behind\r\nthose little islands. The rents in the land, the fracture and dip\r\nof the strata, all here denote the effects of a great revolution:\r\npossibly that which clove asunder the chain of the primitive\r\nmountains, and separated the mica-schist of Araya and the island of\r\nMargareta from the gneiss of Cape Codera. Several of the islands\r\nare visible at Cumana, from the terraces of the houses, and they\r\nproduce, according to the superposition of layers of air more or\r\nless heated, the most singular effects of suspension and mirage.\r\nThe height of the rocks does not probably exceed one hundred and\r\nfifty toises; but at night, when lighted by the moon, they seem to\r\nbe of a very considerable elevation.\r\n\r\nIt may appear extraordinary, to find the Caracas Islands so distant\r\nfrom the city of that name, opposite the coast of the Cumanagotos;\r\nbut the denomination of Caracas denoted at the beginning of the\r\nConquest, not a particular spot, but a tribe of Indians, neighbours\r\nof the Tecs, the Taramaynas, and the Chagaragates. As we came very\r\nnear this group of mountainous islands, we were becalmed; and at\r\nsunrise, small currents drifted us toward Boracha, the largest of\r\nthem. As the rocks rise nearly perpendicular, the shore is abrupt;\r\nand in a subsequent voyage I saw frigates at anchor almost touching\r\nthe land. The temperature of the atmosphere became sensibly higher\r\nwhilst we were sailing among the islands of this little\r\narchipelago. The rocks, heated during the day, throw out at night,\r\nby radiation, a part of the heat absorbed. As the sun arose on the\r\nhorizon, the rugged mountains projected their vast shadows on the\r\nsurface of the ocean. The flamingoes began to fish in places where\r\nthey found in a creek calcareous rocks bordered by a narrow beach.\r\nAll these islands are now entirely uninhabited; but upon one of the\r\nCaracas are found wild goats of large size, brown, and extremely\r\nswift. Our Indian pilot assured us that their flesh has an\r\nexcellent flavour. Thirty years ago a family of whites settled on\r\nthis island, where they cultivated maize and cassava. The father\r\nalone survived his children. As his wealth increased, he purchased\r\ntwo black slaves; and by these slaves he was murdered. The goats\r\nbecame wild, but the cultivated plants perished. Maize in America,\r\nlike wheat in Europe, connected with man since his first\r\nmigrations, appears to be preserved only by his care. We sometimes\r\nsee these nutritive gramina disseminate themselves; but when left\r\nto nature the birds prevent their reproduction by destroying the\r\nseeds.\r\n\r\nWe anchored for some hours in the road of New Barcelona, at the\r\nmouth of the river Neveri, of which the Indian (Cumanagoto) name is\r\nEnipiricuar. This river is full of crocodiles, which sometimes\r\nextend their excursions into the open sea, especially in calm\r\nweather. They are of the species common in the Orinoco, and bear so\r\nmuch resemblance to the crocodile of Egypt, that they have long\r\nbeen confounded together. It may easily be conceived that an\r\nanimal, the body of which is surrounded with a kind of armour, must\r\nbe nearly indifferent to the saltness of the water. Pigafetta\r\nrelates in his journal recently published at Milan that he saw, on\r\nthe shores of the island of Borneo, crocodiles which inhabit alike\r\nland and sea. These facts must be interesting to geologists, since\r\nattention has been fixed on the fresh-water formations, and the\r\ncurious mixture of marine and fluviatile petrifactions sometimes\r\nobserved in certain very recent rocks.\r\n\r\nThe port of Barcelona has maintained a very active commerce since\r\n1795. From Barcelona is exported most of the produce of those vast\r\nsteppes which extend from the south side of the chain of the coast\r\nas far as the Orinoco, and in which cattle of every kind are almost\r\nas abundant as in the Pampas of Buenos Ayres. The commercial\r\nindustry of these countries depends on the demand in the West India\r\nIslands for salted provision, oxen, mules, and horses. The coasts\r\nof Terra Firma being opposite to the island of Cuba, at a distance\r\nof fifteen or eighteen days' sail, the merchants of the Havannah\r\nprefer, especially in time of peace, obtaining their provision from\r\nthe port of Barcelona, to the risk of a long voyage in another\r\nhemisphere to the mouth of the Rio de la Plata. The situation of\r\nBarcelona is singularly advantageous for the trade in cattle. The\r\nanimals have only three days' journey from the llanos to the port,\r\nwhile it requires eight or nine days to reach Cumana, on account of\r\nthe chain of mountains of the Brigantine and the Imposible.\r\n\r\nHaving landed on the right bank of the Neveri, we ascended to a\r\nlittle fort called El Morro de Barcelona, situated at the elevation\r\nof sixty or seventy toises above the level of the sea. The Morro is\r\na calcareous rock which has been lately fortified.\r\n\r\nThe view from the summit of the Morro is not without beauty. The\r\nrocky island of Boracha lies on the east, the lofty promontory of\r\nUnare is on the west, and below are seen the mouth of the river\r\nNeveri, and the arid shores on which the crocodiles come to sleep\r\nin the sun. Notwithstanding the extreme heat of the air, for the\r\nthermometer, exposed to the reflection of the white calcareous\r\nrock, rose to 38 degrees, we traversed the whole of the eminence. A\r\nfortunate chance led us to observe some very curious geological\r\nphenomena, which we again met with in the Cordilleras of Mexico.\r\nThe limestone of Barcelona has a dull, even, or conchoidal\r\nfracture, with very flat cavities. It is divided into very thin\r\nstrata, and exhibits less analogy with the limestone of Cumanacoa,\r\nthan with that of Caripe, forming the cavern of the Guacharo. It is\r\ntraversed by banks of schistose jasper,* (Kieselschiefer of Werner.\r\n)* black, with a conchoidal fracture, and breaking into fragments\r\nof a parallelopipedal figure. This fossil does not exhibit those\r\nlittle streaks of quartz so common in the Lydian stone. It is found\r\ndecomposed at its surface into a yellowish grey crust, and it does\r\nnot act upon the magnet. Its edges, a little translucid, give it\r\nsome resemblance to the hornstone, so common in secondary\r\nlimestones.* (* In Switzerland, the hornstone passing into common\r\njasper is found in kidney-stones, and in layers both in the Alpine\r\nand Jura limestone, especially in the former.) It is remarkable\r\nthat we find the schistose jasper which in Europe characterizes the\r\ntransition rocks,* (The transition-limestone and schist.) in a\r\nlimestone having great analogy with that of Jura. In the study of\r\nformations, which is the great end of geognosy, the knowledge\r\nacquired in the old and new worlds should be made to furnish\r\nreciprocal aid to each other. It appears that these black strata\r\nare found also in the calcareous mountains of the island of\r\nBoracha.* (* We saw some of it as ballast, in a fishing boat at\r\nPunta Araya. Its fragments might have been mistaken for basalt.)\r\nAnother jasper, that known by the name of the Egyptian pebble, was\r\nfound by M. Bonpland near the Indian village of Curacatiche or\r\nCuracaguitiche, fifteen leagues south of the Morro of Barcelona,\r\nwhen, on our return from the Orinoco, we crossed the llanos, and\r\napproached the mountains on the coast. This stone presented\r\nyellowish concentric lines and bands, on a reddish brown ground. It\r\nappeared to me that the round pieces of Egyptian jasper belonged\r\nalso to the Barcelona limestone. Yet, according to M. Cordier, the\r\nfine pebbles of Suez owe their origin to a breccia formation, or\r\nsiliceous agglomerate.\r\n\r\nAt the moment of our setting sail, on the 19th of November, at\r\nnoon, I took some altitudes of the moon, to determine the longitude\r\nof the Morro. The difference of meridian between Cumana and the\r\ntown of Barcelona, where I made a great number of astronomical\r\nobservations in 1800, is 34 minutes 48 seconds. I found the dip of\r\nthe needle 42.20 degrees: the intensity of the forces was equal to\r\n224 oscillations.\r\n\r\nFrom the Morro of Barcelona to Cape Codera, the land becomes low,\r\nas it recedes southward; and the soundings extend to the distance\r\nof three miles. Beyond this we find the bottom at forty-five or\r\nfifty fathoms. The temperature of the sea at its surface was 25.9\r\ndegrees; but when we were passing through the narrow channel which\r\nseparates the two Piritu Islands, in three fathoms water, the\r\nthermometer was only 24.5 degrees. The difference would perhaps be\r\ngreater, if the current, which runs rapidly westward, stirred up\r\ndeeper water; and if, in a pass of such small width, the land did\r\nnot contribute to raise the temperature of the sea. The Piritu\r\nIslands resemble those shoals which become visible when the tide\r\nfalls. They do not rise more than eight or nine inches above the\r\nmean height of the sea. Their surface is smooth, and covered with\r\ngrass. We might have thought we were gazing on some of our own\r\nnorthern meadows. The disk of the setting sun appeared like a globe\r\nof fire suspended over the savannah; and its last rays, as they\r\nswept the earth, illumined the grass, which was at the same time\r\nagitated by the evening breeze. In the low and humid parts of the\r\nequinoctial zone, even when the gramineous plants and reeds present\r\nthe aspect of a meadow, a rich accessory of the picture is usually\r\nwanting; I allude to that variety of wild flowers, which, scarcely\r\nrising above the grass, seem as it were, to lie upon a smooth bed\r\nof verdure. Within the tropics, the strength and luxury of\r\nvegetation give such a development to plants, that the smallest of\r\nthe dicotyledonous family become shrubs. It would seem as if the\r\nliliaceous plants, mingling with the gramina, assumed the place of\r\nthe flowers of our meadows. Their form is indeed striking; they\r\ndazzle by the variety and splendour of their colours; but being too\r\nhigh above the soil, they disturb that harmonious proportion which\r\ncharacterizes the plants of our European meadows. Nature has in\r\nevery zone stamped on the landscape the peculiar type of beauty\r\nproper to the locality.\r\n\r\nWe must not be surprised that fertile islands, so near Terra Firma,\r\nare not now inhabited. It was only at the early period of the\r\ndiscovery, and whilst the Caribbees, Chaymas, and Cumanagotos were\r\nstill masters of the coast, that the Spaniards formed settlements\r\nat Cubagua and Margareta. When the natives were subdued, or driven\r\nsouthward in the direction of the savannahs, the preference was\r\ngiven to settlements on the continent, where there was a choice of\r\nland, and where there were Indians, who might be treated like\r\nbeasts of burden. Had the little islands of Tortuga, Blanquilla,\r\nand Orchilla been situated in the group of the Antilles, they would\r\nnot have remained without traces of cultivation.\r\n\r\nVessels of heavy burthen pass between the main land and the most\r\nsouthern of the Piritu Islands. Being very low, their northern\r\npoint is dreaded by pilots who near the coast in those latitudes.\r\nWhen we found ourselves to westward of the Morro of Barcelona, and\r\nthe mouth of the river Unare, the sea, till then calm, became\r\nagitated and rough in proportion as we approached Cape Codera. The\r\ninfluence of that vast promontory is felt from afar, in that part\r\nof the Caribbean Sea. The length of the passage from Cumana to La\r\nGuayra depends on the degree of ease or difficulty with which Cape\r\nCodera can be doubled. Beyond this cape the sea constantly runs so\r\nhigh, that we can scarcely believe we are near a coast where (from\r\nthe point of Paria as far as Cape San Roman) a gale of wind is\r\nnever known. On the 20th of November at sunrise we were so far\r\nadvanced, that we might expect to double the cape in a few hours.\r\nWe hoped to reach La Guayra the same day; but our Indian pilot\r\nbeing afraid of the privateers who were near that port, thought it\r\nwould be prudent to make for land, and anchor in the little harbour\r\nof Higuerote, which we had already passed, and await the shelter of\r\nnight to proceed on our voyage.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of November at nine in the morning we were at anchor in\r\nthe bay just mentioned, situated westward of the mouth of the Rio\r\nCapaya. We found there neither village nor farm, but merely two or\r\nthree huts, inhabited by Mestizo fishermen. Their livid hue, and\r\nthe meagre condition of their children, sufficed to remind us that\r\nthis spot is one of the most unhealthy of the whole coast. The sea\r\nhas so little depth along these shores, that even with the smallest\r\nbarks it is impossible to reach the shore without wading through\r\nthe water. The forests come down nearly to the beach, which is\r\ncovered with thickets of mangroves, avicennias, manchineel-trees,\r\nand that species of suriana which the natives call romero de la\r\nmar.* (* Suriana maritima.) To these thickets, and particularly to\r\nthe exhalations of the mangroves, the extreme insalubrity of the\r\nair is attributed here, as in other places in both Indies. On\r\nquitting the boats, and whilst we were yet fifteen or twenty toises\r\ndistant from land, we perceived a faint and sickly smell, which\r\nreminded me of that diffused through the galleries of deserted\r\nmines, where the lights begin to be extinguished, and the timber is\r\ncovered with flocculent byssus. The temperature of the air rose to\r\n34 degrees, heated by the reverberation from the white sands which\r\nform a line between the mangroves and the great trees of the\r\nforest. As the shore descends with a gentle slope, small tides are\r\nsufficient alternately to cover and uncover the roots and part of\r\nthe trunks of the mangroves. It is doubtless whilst the sun heats\r\nthe humid wood, and causes the fermentation, as it were, of the\r\nground, of the remains of dead leaves and of the molluscs enveloped\r\nin the drift of floating seaweed, that those deleterious gases are\r\nformed, which escape our researches. We observed that the\r\nsea-water, along the whole coast, acquired a yellowish brown tint,\r\nwherever it came into contact with the mangrove trees.\r\n\r\nStruck with this phenomenon, I gathered at Higuerote a considerable\r\nquantity of branches and roots, for the purpose of making some\r\nexperiments on the infusion of the mangrove, on my arrival at\r\nCaracas. The infusion in warm water had a brown colour and an\r\nastringent taste. It contained a mixture of extractive matter and\r\ntannin. The rhizophora, the mistletoe, the cornel-tree, in short,\r\nall the plants which belong to the natural families of the\r\nlorantheous and the caprifoliaceous plants, have the same\r\nproperties. The infusion of mangrove-wood, kept in contact with\r\natmospheric air under a glass jar for twelve days, was not sensibly\r\ndeteriorated in purity. A little blackish flocculent sediment was\r\nformed, but it was attended by no sensible absorption of oxygen.\r\nThe wood and roots of the mangrove placed under water were exposed\r\nto the rays of the sun. I tried to imitate the daily operations of\r\nnature on the coasts at the rise of the tide. Bubbles of air were\r\ndisengaged, and at the expiration of ten days they formed a volume\r\nof thirty-three cubic inches. They were a mixture of azotic gas and\r\ncarbonic acid. Nitrous gas scarcely indicated the presence of\r\noxygen.* (* In a hundred parts there were eighty-four of nitrogen,\r\nfifteen of carbonic acid gas that the water had not absorbed, and\r\none of oxygen.) Lastly, I set the wood and the roots of the\r\nmangrove thoroughly wetted, to act on a given volume of atmospheric\r\nair in a phial with a ground-glass stopple. The whole of the oxygen\r\ndisappeared; and, far from being superseded by carbonic acid,\r\nlime-water indicated only 0.02. There was even a diminution of the\r\nvolume of air, more than correspondent with the oxygen absorbed.\r\nThese slight experiments led me to conclude that it is the\r\nmoistened bark and wood which act upon the atmosphere in the\r\nforests of mangrove-trees, and not the water strongly tinged with\r\nyellow, forming a distinct band along the coasts. In pursuing the\r\ndifferent stages of the decomposition of the ligneous matter, I\r\nobserved no appearance of a disengagement of sulphuretted hydrogen,\r\nto which many travellers attribute the smell perceived amidst\r\nmangroves. The decomposition of the earthy and alkaline sulphates,\r\nand their transition to the state of sulphurets, may no doubt\r\nfavour this disengagement in many littoral and marine plants; for\r\ninstance, in the fuci: but I am rather inclined to think that the\r\nrhizophora, the avicennia, and the conocarpus, augment the\r\ninsalubrity of the air by the animal matter which they contain\r\nconjointly with tannin. These shrubs belong to the three natural\r\nfamilies of the Lorantheae, the Combretaceae, and the Pyrenaceae,\r\nin which the astringent principle abounds; this principle\r\naccompanies gelatin, even in the bark of beech, alder, and\r\nnut-trees.\r\n\r\nMoreover, a thick wood spreading over marshy grounds would diffuse\r\nnoxious exhalations in the atmosphere, even though that wood were\r\ncomposed of trees possessing in themselves no deleterious\r\nproperties. Wherever mangroves grow on the sea-shore, the beach is\r\ncovered with infinite numbers of molluscs and insects. These\r\nanimals love shade and faint light, and they find themselves\r\nsheltered from the shock of the waves amid the scaffolding of thick\r\nand intertwining roots, which rises like lattice-work above the\r\nsurface of the waters. Shell-fish cling to this lattice; crabs\r\nnestle in the hollow trunks; and the seaweeds, drifted to the coast\r\nby the winds and tides, remain suspended on the branches which\r\nincline towards the earth. Thus, maritime forests, by the\r\naccumulation of a slimy mud between the roots of the trees,\r\nincrease the extent of land. But whilst these forests gain on the\r\nsea, they do not enlarge their own dimensions; on the contrary,\r\ntheir progress is the cause of their destruction. Mangroves, and\r\nother plants with which they live constantly in society, perish in\r\nproportion as the ground dries and they are no longer bathed with\r\nsalt water. Their old trunks, covered with shells, and half-buried\r\nin the sand, denote, after the lapse of ages, the path they have\r\nfollowed in their migrations, and the limits of the land which they\r\nhave wrested from the ocean.\r\n\r\nThe bay of Higuerote is favourably situated for examining Cape\r\nCodera, which is there seen in its full extent seven miles distant.\r\nThis promontory is more remarkable for its size than for its\r\nelevation, being only about two hundred toises high. It is\r\nperpendicular on the north-west and east. In these grand profiles\r\nthe dip of the strata appears to be distinguishable. Judging from\r\nthe fragments of rock found along the coast, and from the hills\r\nnear Higuerote, Cape Codera is not composed of granite with a\r\ngranular texture, but of a real gneiss with a foliated texture. Its\r\nlaminae are very broad and sometimes sinuous.* (* Dickflasriger\r\ngneiss.) They contain large nodules of reddish feldspar and but\r\nlittle quartz. The mica is found in superposed lamellae, not\r\nisolated. The strata nearest the bay were in the direction of 60\r\ndegrees north-east, and dipped 80 degrees to north-west. These\r\nrelations of direction and of dip are the same at the great\r\nmountain of the Silla, near Caracas, and to the east of Maniquarez,\r\nin the isthmus of Araya. They seem to prove that the primitive\r\nchain of that isthmus, after having been ruptured or swallowed up\r\nby the sea along a space of thirty-five leagues,* (* Between the\r\nmeridians of Maniquarez and Higuerote.) appears anew in Cape\r\nCodera, and continues westward as a chain of the coast.\r\n\r\nI was assured that, in the interior of the earth, south of\r\nHiguerote, limestone formations are found. The gneiss did not act\r\nupon the magnetic needle; yet along the coast, which forms a cove\r\nnear Cape Codera, and which is covered with a fine forest, I saw\r\nmagnetic sand mixed with spangles of mica, deposited by the sea.\r\nThis phenomenon occurs again near the port of La Guayra. Possibly\r\nit may denote the existence of some strata of hornblende-schist\r\ncovered by the waters, in which schist the sand is disseminated.\r\nCape Codera forms on the north an immense spherical segment. A\r\nshallow which stretches along its foot is known to navigators by\r\nthe name of the points of Tutumo and of San Francisco.\r\n\r\nThe road by land from Higuerote to Caracas, runs through a wild and\r\nhumid tract of country, by the Montana of Capaya, north of\r\nCaucagua, and the valley of Rio Guatira and Guarenas. Some of our\r\nfellow-travellers determined on taking this road, and M. Bonpland\r\nalso preferred it, notwithstanding the continual rains and the\r\noverflowing of the rivers. It afforded him the opportunity of\r\nmaking a rich collection of new plants.* (* Bauhinia ferruginea,\r\nBrownea racemosa, B ed. Inga hymenaeifolia, I. curiepensis (which\r\nWilldenouw has called by mistake I. caripensis), etc.) For my part,\r\nI continued alone with the Guaiqueria pilot the voyage by sea; for\r\nI thought it hazardous to lose sight of the instruments which we\r\nwere to make use of on the banks of the Orinoco.\r\n\r\nWe set sail at night-fall. The wind was unfavourable, and we\r\ndoubled Cape Codera with difficulty. The surges were short, and\r\noften broke one upon another. The sea ran the higher, owing to the\r\nwind being contrary to the current, till after midnight. The\r\ngeneral motion of the waters within the tropics towards the west is\r\nfelt strongly on the coast during two-thirds of the year. In the\r\nmonths of September, October, and November, the current often flows\r\neastward for fifteen or twenty days in succession; and vessels on\r\ntheir way from Guayra to Porto Cabello have sometimes been unable\r\nto stem the current which runs from west to east, although they\r\nhave had the wind astern. The cause of these anomalies is not yet\r\ndiscovered. The pilots think they are the effect of gales of wind\r\nfrom the north-west in the gulf of Mexico.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of November, at sunrise, we were to the west of Cape\r\nCodera, opposite Curuao. The coast is rocky and very elevated, the\r\nscenery at once wild and picturesque. We were sufficiently near\r\nland to distinguish scattered huts surrounded by cocoa-trees, and\r\nmasses of vegetation, which stood out from the dark ground of the\r\nrocks. The mountains are everywhere perpendicular, and three or\r\nfour thousand feet high; their sides cast broad and deep shadows\r\nupon the humid land, which stretches out to the sea, glowing with\r\nthe freshest verdure. This shore produces most of those fruits of\r\nthe hot regions, which are seen in such great abundance in the\r\nmarkets of the Caracas. The fields cultivated with sugar-cane and\r\nmaize, between Camburi and Niguatar, stretch through narrow\r\nvalleys, looking like crevices or clefts in the rocks: and\r\npenetrated by the rays of the sun, then above the horizon, they\r\npresented the most singular contrasts of light and shade.\r\n\r\nThe mountain of Niguatar and the Silla of Caracas are the loftiest\r\nsummits of this littoral chain. The first almost reaches the height\r\nof Canigou; it seems as if the Pyrenees or the Alps, stripped of\r\ntheir snows, had risen from the bosom of the ocean; so much more\r\nstupendous do mountains appear when viewed for the first time from\r\nthe sea. Near Caravalleda, the cultivated lands enlarge; we find\r\nhills with gentle declivities, and the vegetation rises to a great\r\nheight. The sugar-cane is here cultivated, and the monks of La\r\nMerced have a plantation with two hundred slaves. This spot was\r\nformerly extremely subject to fever; and it is said that the air\r\nhas acquired salubrity since trees have been planted round a small\r\nlake, the emanations of which were dreaded, and which is now less\r\nexposed to the ardour of the sun. To the west of Caravalleda, a\r\nwall of bare rock again projects forward in the direction of the\r\nsea, but it has little extent. After having passed it, we\r\nimmediately discovered the pleasantly situated village of Macuto;\r\nthe black rocks of La Guayra, studded with batteries rising in\r\ntiers one over another, and in the misty distance, Cabo Blanco, a\r\nlong promontory with conical summits, and of dazzling whiteness.\r\nCocoa-trees border the shore, and give it, under that burning sky,\r\nan appearance of fertility.\r\n\r\nI landed in the port of La Guayra, and the same evening made\r\npreparations for transporting my instruments to Caracas. Having\r\nbeen recommended not to sleep in the town, where the yellow fever\r\nhad been raging only a few weeks previously, I fixed my lodging in\r\na house on a little hill, above the village of Maiquetia, a place\r\nmore exposed to fresh winds than La Guayra. I reached Caracas on\r\nthe 21st of November, four days sooner than M. Bonpland, who, with\r\nthe other travellers on the land journey, had suffered greatly from\r\nthe rain and the inundations of the torrents, between Capaya and\r\nCuriepe.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding further, I will here subjoin a description of La\r\nGuayra, and the extraordinary road which leads from thence to the\r\ntown of Caracas, adding thereto all the observations made by M.\r\nBonpland and myself, in an excursion to Cabo Blanco about the end\r\nof January 1800.\r\n\r\nLa Guayra is rather a roadstead than a port. The sea is constantly\r\nagitated, and ships suffer at once by the violence of the wind, the\r\ntideways, and the bad anchorage. The lading is taken in with\r\ndifficulty, and the swell prevents the embarkation of mules here,\r\nas at New Barcelona and Porto Cabello. The free mulattoes and\r\nnegroes, who carry the cacao on board the ships, are a class of men\r\nremarkable for muscular strength. They wade up to their waists\r\nthrough the water; and it is remarkable that they are never\r\nattacked by the sharks, so common in this harbour. This fact seems\r\nconnected with what I have often observed within the tropics, with\r\nrespect to other classes of animals which live in society, for\r\ninstance monkeys and crocodiles. In the Missions of the Orinoco,\r\nand on the banks of the river Amazon, the Indians, who catch\r\nmonkeys to sell them, know very well that they can easily succeed\r\nin taming those which inhabit certain islands; while monkeys of the\r\nsame species, caught on the neighbouring continent, die of terror\r\nor rage when they find themselves in the power of man. The\r\ncrocodiles of one lake in the llanos are cowardly, and flee even\r\nwhen in the water; whilst those of another lake will attack with\r\nextreme intrepidity. It would be difficult to explain this\r\ndifference of disposition and habits, by the mere aspect of the\r\nrespective localities. The sharks of the port of La Guayra seem to\r\nfurnish an analogous example. They are dangerous and blood-thirsty\r\nat the island opposite the coast of Caracas, at the Roques, at\r\nBonayre, and at Curassao; while they forbear to attack persons\r\nswimming in the ports of La Guayra and Santa Martha. The natives,\r\nwho like the ignorant mass of people in every country, in seeking\r\nthe explanation of natural phenomena, always have recourse to the\r\nmarvellous, affirm that in the ports just mentioned, a bishop gave\r\nhis benediction to the sharks.\r\n\r\nThe situation of La Guayra is very singular, and can only be\r\ncompared to that of Santa Cruz in Teneriffe. The chain of mountains\r\nwhich separates the port from the high valley of Caracas, descends\r\nalmost directly into the sea; and the houses of the town are backed\r\nby a wall of steep rocks. There scarcely remains one hundred or one\r\nhundred and forty toises breadth of flat ground between the wall\r\nand the ocean. The town has six or eight thousand inhabitants, and\r\ncontains only two streets, running parallel with each other east\r\nand west. It is commanded by the battery of Cerro Colorado; and its\r\nfortifications along the sea-shore are well disposed, and kept in\r\nrepair. The aspect of this place has in it something solitary and\r\ngloomy; we seemed not to be on a continent, covered with vast\r\nforests, but on a rocky island, destitute of vegetation. With the\r\nexception of Cabo Blanco and the cocoa-trees of Maiquetia, no view\r\nmeets the eye but that of the horizon, the sea, and the azure vault\r\nof heaven. The heat is excessive during the day, and most\r\nfrequently during the night. The climate of La Guayra is justly\r\nconsidered to be hotter than that of Cumana, Porto Cabello, and\r\nCoro, because the sea-breeze is less felt, and the air is heated by\r\nthe radiant caloric which the perpendicular rocks emit from the\r\ntime the sun sets. The examination of the thermometric observations\r\nmade during nine months at La Guayra by an eminent physician,\r\nenabled me to compare the climate of this port, with those of\r\nCumana, of the Havannah, and of Vera Cruz. This comparison is the\r\nmore interesting, as it furnishes an inexhaustible subject of\r\nconversation in the Spanish colonies, and among the mariners who\r\nfrequent those latitudes. As nothing is more deceiving in such\r\nmatters than the testimony of the senses, we can judge of the\r\ndifference of climates only by numerical calculations.\r\n\r\nThe four places of which we have been speaking are considered as\r\nthe hottest on the shores of the New World. A comparison of them\r\nmay serve to confirm what we have several times observed, that it\r\nis generally the duration of a high temperature, and not the excess\r\nof heat, or its absolute quantity, which occasions the sufferings\r\nof the inhabitants of the torrid zone.\r\n\r\nA series of thermometric observations shows, that La Guayra is one\r\nof the hottest places on the earth; that the quantity of heat which\r\nit receives in the course of a year is a little greater than that\r\nfelt at Cumana; but that in the months of November, December, and\r\nJanuary (at equal distance from the two passages of the sun through\r\nthe zenith of the town), the atmosphere cools more at La Guayra.\r\nMay not this cooling, much slighter than that which is felt almost\r\nat the same time at Vera Cruz and at the Havannah, be the effect of\r\nthe more westerly position of La Guayra? The aerial ocean, which\r\nappears to form only one mass, is agitated by currents, the limits\r\nof which are fixed by immutable laws; and its temperature is\r\nvariously modified by the configuration of the lands and seas by\r\nwhich it is sustained. It may be subdivided into several basins,\r\nwhich overflow into each other, and of which the most agitated (for\r\ninstance, that over the gulf of Mexico, or between the sierra of\r\nSanta Martha and the gulf of Darien) have a powerful influence on\r\nthe refrigeration and the motion of the neighbouring columns of\r\nair. The north winds sometimes cause influxes and counter-currents\r\nin the south-west part of the Caribbean Sea, which seem, during\r\nparticular months, to diminish the heat as far as Terra Firma.\r\n\r\nAt the time of my abode at La Guayra, the yellow fever, or\r\ncalentura amarilla, had been known only two years; and the\r\nmortality it occasioned had not been very great, because the\r\nconfluence of strangers on the coast of Caracas was less\r\nconsiderable than at the Havannah or Vera Cruz. A few individuals,\r\neven creoles and mulattoes, were sometimes carried off suddenly by\r\ncertain irregular remittent fevers; which, from being complicated\r\nwith bilious appearances, hemorrhages, and other symptoms equally\r\nalarming, appeared to have some analogy with the yellow fever. The\r\nvictims of these maladies were generally men employed in the hard\r\nlabour of cutting wood in the forests, for instance, in the\r\nneighbourhood of the little port of Carupano, or the gulf of Santa\r\nFe, west of Cumana. Their death often alarmed the unacclimated\r\nEuropeans, in towns usually regarded as peculiarly healthy; but the\r\nseeds of the sporadic malady were propagated no farther. On the\r\ncoast of Terra Firma, the real typhus of America, which is known by\r\nthe names vomito prieto (black vomit) and yellow fever, and which\r\nmust be considered as a morbid affection sui generis, was known\r\nonly at Porto Cabello, at Carthagena, and at Santa Martha, where\r\nGastelbondo observed and described it in 1729. The Spaniards\r\nrecently disembarked, and the inhabitants of the valley of Caracas,\r\nwere not then afraid to reside at La Guayra. They complained only\r\nof the oppressive heat which prevailed during a great part of the\r\nyear. If they exposed themselves to the immediate action of the\r\nsun, they dreaded at most only those attacks of inflammation of the\r\nskin or eyes, which are felt everywhere in the torrid zone, and are\r\noften accompanied by a febrile affection and congestion in the\r\nhead. Many individuals preferred the ardent but uniform climate of\r\nLa Guayra to the cool but extremely variable climate of Caracas;\r\nand scarcely any mention was made of the insalubrity of the former\r\nport.\r\n\r\nSince the year 1797 everything has changed. Commerce being thrown\r\nopen to other vessels besides those of the mother country, seamen\r\nborn in colder parts of Europe than Spain, and consequently more\r\nsusceptible to the climate of the torrid zone, began to frequent La\r\nGuayra. The yellow fever broke out. North Americans, seized with\r\nthe typhus, were received in the Spanish hospitals; and it was\r\naffirmed that they had imported the contagion, and that the disease\r\nhad appeared on board a brig from Philadelphia, even before the\r\nvessel had entered the roads of La Guayra. The captain of the brig\r\ndenied the fact; and asserted that, far from having introduced the\r\nmalady, his crew had caught it in the port. We know from what\r\nhappened at Cadiz in 1800, how difficult it is to elucidate facts,\r\nwhen their uncertainty serves to favour theories diametrically\r\nopposite one to another. The more enlightened inhabitants of\r\nCaracas and La Guayra, divided in opinion, like the physicians of\r\nEurope and the United States, on the question of the contagion of\r\nyellow fever, cited the instance of the American vessel; some for\r\nthe purpose of proving that the typhus had come from abroad, and\r\nothers, to show that it had taken birth in the country itself.\r\nThose who advocated the latter opinion, admitted that an\r\nextraordinary alteration had been caused in the constitution of the\r\natmosphere by the overflowings of the Rio de La Guayra. This\r\ntorrent, which in general is not ten inches deep, was swelled after\r\nsixty hours' rain in the mountains, in so extraordinary a manner,\r\nthat it bore down trunks of trees and masses of rock of\r\nconsiderable size. During this flood the waters were from thirty to\r\nforty feet in breadth, and from eight to ten feet deep. It was\r\nsupposed that, issuing from some subterranean basin, formed by\r\nsuccessive infiltrations, they had flowed into the recently cleared\r\narable lands. Many houses were carried away by the torrent; and the\r\ninundation became the more dangerous for the stores, in consequence\r\nof the gate of the town, which could alone afford an outlet to the\r\nwaters, being accidentally closed. It was necessary to make a\r\nbreach in the wall on the sea-side. More than thirty persons\r\nperished, and the damage was computed at half a million of\r\npiastres. The stagnant water, which infected the stores, the\r\ncellars, and the dungeons of the public prison, no doubt diffused\r\nmiasms in the air, which, as a predisposing cause, may have\r\naccelerated the development of the yellow fever; but I believe that\r\nthe inundation of the Rio de la Guayra was no more the primary\r\ncause, than the overflowings of the Guadalquivir, the Xenil, and\r\nthe Gual-Medina, were at Seville, at Ecija, and at Malaga, the\r\nprimary causes of the fatal epidemics of 1800 and 1804. I examined\r\nwith attention the bed of the torrent of La Guayra; and found it to\r\nconsist merely of a barren soil, blocks of mica-slate, and gneiss,\r\ncontaining pyrites detached from the Sierra de Avila, but nothing\r\nthat could have had any effect in deteriorating the purity of the\r\nair.\r\n\r\nSince the years 1797 and 1798, at which periods there prevailed\r\ndreadful mortality at Philadelphia, St. Lucia, and St. Domingo, the\r\nyellow fever has continued its ravages at La Guayra. It has proved\r\nfatal not only to the troops newly arrived from Spain, but also to\r\nthose levied in parts remote from the coasts, in the llanos between\r\nCalabozo and Uritucu, regions almost as hot as La Guayra, but\r\nfavourable to health. This latter fact would seem more surprising,\r\ndid we not know, that even the natives of Vera Cruz, who are not\r\nattacked with typhus in their own town, sometimes sink under it\r\nduring the epidemics of the Havannah and the United States. As the\r\nblack vomit finds an insurmountable barrier at the Encero (four\r\nhundred and seventy-six toises high), on the declivity of the\r\nmountains of Mexico, in the direction of Xalapa, where oaks begin\r\nto appear, and the climate begins to be cool and pleasant, so the\r\nyellow fever scarcely ever passes beyond the ridge of mountains\r\nwhich separates La Guayra from the valley of Caracas. This valley\r\nhas been exempt from the malady for a considerable time; for we\r\nmust not confound the vomito and the yellow fever with the\r\nirregular and bilious fevers. The Cumbre and the Cerro do Avila\r\nform a very useful rampart to the town of Caracas, the elevation of\r\nwhich a little exceeds that of the Encero, but of which the mean\r\ntemperature is above that of Xalapa.\r\n\r\nI have published in another work* (* Nouvelle Espagne tome 2.) the\r\nobservations made by M. Bonpland and myself on the locality of the\r\ntowns periodically subject to the visitation of yellow fever; and I\r\nshall not hazard here any new conjectures on the changes observed\r\nin the pathogenic constitution of particular localities. The more I\r\nreflect on this subject, the more mysterious appears to me all that\r\nrelates to those gaseous emanations which we call so vaguely the\r\nseeds of contagion, and which are supposed to be developed by a\r\ncorrupted air, destroyed by cold, conveyed from place to place in\r\ngarments, and attached to the walls of houses. How can we explain\r\nwhy, for the space of eighteen years prior to 1794, there was not a\r\nsingle instance of the vomito at Vera Cruz, though the concourse of\r\nunacclimated Europeans and of Mexicans from the interior, was very\r\nconsiderable; though sailors indulged in the same excesses with\r\nwhich they are still reproached; and though the town was not so\r\nclean as it has been since the year 1800?\r\n\r\nThe following is the series of pathological facts, considered in\r\ntheir simplest point of view. When a great number of persons, born\r\nin a cold climate, arrive at the same period in a port of the\r\ntorrid zone, not particularly dreaded by navigators, the typhus of\r\nAmerica begins to appear. Those persons have not had typhus during\r\ntheir passage; it appears among them only after they have landed.\r\nIs the atmospheric constitution changed? or is it that a new form\r\nof disease develops itself among individuals whose susceptibility\r\nis highly increased?\r\n\r\nThe typhus soon begins to extend its ravages among other Europeans,\r\nborn in more southern countries. If propagated by contagion, it\r\nseems surprising that in the towns of the equinoctial continent it\r\ndoes not attach itself to certain streets; and that immediate\r\ncontact* does not augment the danger, any more than seclusion\r\ndiminishes it. (* In the oriental plague (another form of typhus\r\ncharacterised by great disorder of the lymphatic system) immediate\r\ncontact is less to be feared than is generally thought. Larrey\r\nmaintains that the tumified glands may be touched or cauterized\r\nwithout danger; but he thinks we ought not to risk putting on the\r\nclothes of persons attacked with the plague.--Memoire sur les\r\nMaladies de l'Armee Francoise en Egypte page 35.) The sick, when\r\nremoved to the inland country, and especially to cooler and more\r\nelevated spots, to Xalapa, for instance, do not communicate typhus\r\nto the inhabitants of those places, either because the disease is\r\nnot contagious in its nature, or because the predisposing causes\r\nare not the same as in the regions of the shore. When there is a\r\nconsiderable lowering of the temperature, the epidemic usually\r\nceases, even on the spot where it first appeared. It again breaks\r\nout at the approach of the hot season, and sometimes long before;\r\nthough during several months there may have been no sick person in\r\nthe harbour, and no ship may have entered it.\r\n\r\nThe typhus of America appears to be confined to the shore, either\r\nbecause persons who bring the disease disembark there, and goods\r\nsupposed to be impregnated with deleterious miasms are there\r\naccumulated; or because on the sea-side gaseous emanations of a\r\nparticular nature are formed. The aspect of the places subject to\r\nthe ravages of typhus seems often to exclude all idea of a local or\r\nendemical origin. It has been known to prevail in the Canaries, the\r\nBermudas, and among the small West India Islands, in dry places\r\nformerly distinguished for the great salubrity of their climate.\r\nExamples of the propagation of the yellow fever in the inland parts\r\nof the torrid zone appear very doubtful: that malady may have been\r\nconfounded with remitting bilious fevers. With respect to the\r\ntemperate zone, in which the contagious character of the American\r\ntyphus is more decided, the disease has unquestionably spread far\r\nfrom the shore, even into very elevated places, exposed to cool and\r\ndry winds, as in Spain at Medina-Sidonia, at Carlotta, and in the\r\ncity of Murcia. That variety of phenomena which the same epidemic\r\nexhibits, according to the difference of climate, the union of\r\npredisposing causes, its shorter or longer duration, and the degree\r\nof its exacerbation, should render us extremely circumspect in\r\ntracing the secret causes of the American typhus. M. Bailly, who,\r\nat the time of the violent epidemics in 1802 and 1803, was chief\r\nphysician to the colony of St. Domingo, and who studied that\r\ndisease in the island of Cuba, the United States, and Spain, is of\r\nopinion that the typhus is very often, but not always, contagious.\r\n\r\nSince the yellow fever has made such ravages in La Guayra,\r\nexaggerated accounts have been given of the uncleanliness in that\r\nlittle town as well as of Vera Cruz, and of the quays or wharfs of\r\nPhiladelphia. In a place where the soil is extremely dry, destitute\r\nof vegetation, and where scarcely a few drops of water fall in the\r\ncourse of seven or eight months, the causes that produce what are\r\ncalled miasms, cannot be of very frequent occurrence. La Guayra\r\nappeared to me in general to be tolerably clean, with the exception\r\nof the quarter of the slaughter-houses. The sea-side has no beach\r\non which the remains of fuci or molluscs are heaped up; but the\r\nneighbouring coast, which stretches eastward towards Cape Codera,\r\nand consequently to the windward of La Guayra, is extremely\r\nunhealthy. Intermitting, putrid, and bilious fevers often prevail\r\nat Macuto and at Caravalleda; and when from time to time the breeze\r\nis interrupted by a westerly wind, the little bay of Cotia sends\r\nair loaded with putrid emanations towards the coast of La Guayra,\r\nnotwithstanding the rampart opposed by Cabo Blanco.\r\n\r\nThe irritability of the organs being so different in the people of\r\nthe north and those of the south, it cannot be doubted, that with\r\ngreater freedom of commerce, and more frequent and intimate\r\ncommunication between countries situated in different climates, the\r\nyellow fever will extend its ravages in the New World. It is even\r\nprobable that the concurrence of so many exciting causes, and their\r\naction on individuals so differently organized, may give birth to\r\nnew forms of disease and new deviations of the vital powers. This\r\nis one of the evils that inevitably attend rising civilization.\r\n\r\nThe yellow fever and the black vomit cease periodically at the\r\nHavannah and Vera Cruz, when the north winds bring the cold air of\r\nCanada towards the gulf of Mexico. But from the extreme equality of\r\ntemperature which characterizes the climates of Porto Cabello, La\r\nGuayra, New Barcelona, and Cumana, it may be feared that the typhus\r\nwill there become permanent, whenever, from a great influx of\r\nstrangers, it has acquired a high degree of exacerbation.\r\n\r\nTracing the granitic coast of La Guayra westward, we find between\r\nthat port (which is in fact but an ill-sheltered roadstead) and\r\nthat of Porto Cabello, several indentations of the land, furnishing\r\nexcellent anchorage for ships. Such are the small bay of Catia, Los\r\nArecifes, Puerto-la-Cruz, Choroni, Sienega de Ocumare, Turiamo,\r\nBurburata, and Patanebo. All these ports, with the exception of\r\nthat of Burburata, from which mules are exported to Jamaica, are\r\nnow frequented only by small coasting vessels, which are there\r\nladen with provisions and cacao from the surrounding plantations.\r\nThe inhabitants of Caracas are desirous to avail themselves of the\r\nanchorage of Catia, to the west of Cabo Blanco. M. Bonpland and\r\nmyself examined that point of the coast during our second abode at\r\nLa Guayra. A ravine, called the Quebrada de Tipe, descends from the\r\ntable-land of Caracas towards Catia. A plan has long been in\r\ncontemplation for making a cart-road through this ravine and\r\nabandoning the old road to La Guayra, which resembles the passage\r\nover St. Gothard. According to this plan, the port of Catia,\r\nequally large and secure, would supersede that of La Guayra.\r\nUnfortunately, however, all that shore, to leeward of Cabo Blanco,\r\nabounds with mangroves, and is extremely unhealthy. I ascended to\r\nthe summit of the promontory, which forms Cabo Blanco, in order to\r\nobserve the passage of the sun over the meridian. I wished to\r\ncompare in the morning the altitudes taken with an artificial\r\nhorizon and those taken with the horizon of the sea; to verify the\r\napparent depression of the latter, by the barometrical measurement\r\nof the hill. By this method, hitherto very little employed, on\r\nreducing the heights of the sun to the same time, a reflecting\r\ninstrument may be used like an instrument furnished with a level. I\r\nfound the latitude of the cape to be 10 degrees 36 minutes 45\r\nseconds; I could only make use of the angles which gave the image\r\nof the sun reflected on a plane glass; the horizon of the sea was\r\nvery misty, and the windings of the coast prevented me from taking\r\nthe height of the sun on that horizon.\r\n\r\nThe environs of Cabo Blanco are not uninteresting for the study of\r\nrocks. The gneiss here passes into the state of mica-slate\r\n(Glimmerschiefer.), and contains, along the sea-coast, layers of\r\nschistose chlorite. (Chloritschiefer.) In this latter I found\r\ngarnets and magnetical sand. On the road to Catia we see the\r\nchloritic schist passing into hornblende schist.\r\n(Hornblendschiefer.) All these formations are found together in the\r\nprimitive mountains of the old world, especially in the north of\r\nEurope. The sea at the foot of Cabo Blanco throws up on the beach\r\nrolled fragments of a rock, which is a granular mixture of\r\nhornblende and lamellar feldspar. It is what is rather vaguely\r\ncalled PRIMITIVE GRUNSTEIN. In it we can recognize traces of quartz\r\nand pyrites. Submarine rocks probably exist near the coast, which\r\nfurnish these very hard masses. I have compared them in my journal\r\nto the PATERLESTEIN of Fichtelberg, in Franconia, which is also a\r\ndiabase, but so fusible, that glass buttons are made of it, which\r\nare employed in the slave-trade on the coast of Guinea. I believed\r\nat first, according to the analogy of the phenomena furnished by\r\nthe mountains of Franconia, that the presence of these hornblende\r\nmasses with crystals of common (uncompact) feldspar indicated the\r\nproximity of transition rocks; but in the high valley of Caracas,\r\nnear Antimano, balls of the same diabase fill a vein crossing the\r\nmica-slate. On the western declivity of the hill of Cabo Blanco,\r\nthe gneiss is covered with a formation of sandstone, or\r\nconglomerate, extremely recent. This sandstone combines angular\r\nfragments of gneiss, quartz, and chlorite, magnetical sand,\r\nmadrepores, and petrified bivalve shells. Is this formation of the\r\nsame date as that of Punta Araya and Cumana?\r\n\r\nScarcely any part of the coast has so burning a climate as the\r\nenvirons of Cabo Blanco. We suffered much from the heat, augmented\r\nby the reverberation of a barren and dusty soil; but without\r\nfeeling any bad consequences from the effects of insolation. The\r\npowerful action of the sun on the cerebral functions is extremely\r\ndreaded at La Guayra, especially at the period when the yellow\r\nfever begins to be felt. Being one day on the terrace of the house,\r\nobserving at noon the difference of the thermometer in the sun and\r\nin the shade, a man approached me holding in his hand a potion,\r\nwhich he conjured me to swallow. He was a physician, who from his\r\nwindow, had observed me bareheaded, and exposed to the rays of the\r\nsun. He assured me, that, being a native of a very northern\r\nclimate, I should infallibly, after the imprudence I had committed,\r\nbe attacked with the yellow fever that very evening, if I refused\r\nto take the remedy against it. I was not alarmed by this\r\nprediction, however serious, believing myself to have been long\r\nacclimated; but I could not resist yielding to entreaties, prompted\r\nby such benevolent feelings. I swallowed the dose; and the\r\nphysician doubtless counted me among the number of those he had\r\nsaved.\r\n\r\nThe road leading from the port to Caracas (the capital of a\r\ngovernment of near 900,000 inhabitants) resembles, as I have\r\nalready observed, the passage over the Alps, the road of St.\r\nGothard, and of the Great St. Bernard. Taking the level of the road\r\nhad never been attempted before my arrival in the province of\r\nVenezuela. No precise idea had even been formed of the elevation of\r\nthe valley of Caracas. It had indeed been long observed, that the\r\ndescent was much less from La Cumbre and Las Vueltas (the latter is\r\nthe culminating point of the road towards the Pastora at the\r\nentrance of the valley of Caracas), than towards the port of La\r\nGuayra; but the mountain of Avila having a very considerable bulk,\r\nthe eye cannot discern simultaneously the points to be compared. It\r\nis even impossible to form a precise idea of the elevation of\r\nCaracas, from the climate of the valley, where the atmosphere is\r\ncooled by the descending currents of air, and by the mists, which\r\nenvelope the lofty summit of the Silla during a great part of the\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nWhen in the season of the great heats we breathe the burning\r\natmosphere of La Guayra, and turn our eyes towards the mountains,\r\nit seems scarcely possible that, at the distance of five or six\r\nthousand toises, a population of forty thousand individuals\r\nassembled in a narrow valley, enjoys the coolness of spring, a\r\ntemperature which at night descends to 12 degrees of the centesimal\r\nthermometer. This near approach of different climates is common in\r\nthe Cordillera of the Andes; but everywhere, at Mexico, at Quito,\r\nin Peru, and in New Granada, it is only after a long journey into\r\nthe interior, either across plains or along rivers, that we reach\r\nthe great cities, which are the central points of civilization. The\r\nheight of Caracas is but a third of that of Mexico, Quito, and\r\nSanta Fe de Bogota; yet of all the capitals of Spanish America\r\nwhich enjoy a cool and delicious climate in the midst of the torrid\r\nzone, Caracas is nearest to the coast. What a privilege for a city\r\nto possess a seaport at three leagues distance, and to be situated\r\namong mountains, on a table-land, which would produce wheat, if the\r\ncultivation of the coffee-tree were not preferred!\r\n\r\nThe road from La Guayra to the valley of Caracas is infinitely\r\nfiner than the road from Honda to Santa Fe, or that from Guayaquil\r\nto Quito. It is kept in better order than the old road, which led\r\nfrom the port of Vera Cruz to Perote, on the eastern declivity of\r\nthe mountains of New Spain. With good mules it takes but three\r\nhours to go from the port of La Guayra to Caracas; and only two\r\nhours to return. With loaded mules, or on foot, the journey is from\r\nfour to five hours. The road runs along a ridge of rocks extremely\r\nsteep, and after passing the stations bearing respectively the\r\nnames of Torre Quemada, Curucuti, and Salto, we arrive at a large\r\ninn (La Venta) built at six hundred toises above the level of the\r\nsea. The name Torre Quemada, or Burnt Tower, indicates the\r\nsensation that is felt in descending towards La Guayra. A\r\nsuffocating heat is reflected from the walls of rock, and\r\nespecially from the barren plains on which the traveller looks\r\ndown. On this road, as on that from Vera Cruz to Mexico, and\r\nwherever on a rapid declivity the climate changes, the increase of\r\nmuscular strength and the sensation of well-being, which we\r\nexperience as we advance into strata of cooler air, have always\r\nappeared to me less striking than the feeling of languor and\r\ndebility which pervades the frame, when we descend towards the\r\nburning plains of the coast. But such is the organization of man;\r\nand even in the moral world, we are less soothed by that which\r\nameliorates our condition than annoyed by a new sensation of\r\ndiscomfort.\r\n\r\nFrom Curucuti to Salto the ascent is somewhat less laborious. The\r\nsinuosities of the way render the declivity easier, as in the old\r\nroad over Mont Cenis. The Salto (or Leap) is a crevice, which is\r\ncrossed by a draw-bridge. Fortifications crown the summit of the\r\nmountain. At La Venta the thermometer at noon stood at 19.3\r\ndegrees, when at La Guayra it kept up at the same hour at 26.2\r\ndegrees. La Venta enjoys some celebrity in Europe and in the United\r\nStates, for the beauty of its surrounding scenery. When the clouds\r\npermit, this spot affords a magnificent view of the sea, and the\r\nneighbouring coasts. An horizon of more than twenty-two leagues\r\nradius is visible; the white and barren shore reflects a dazzling\r\nmass of light; and the spectator beholds at his feet Cabo Blanco,\r\nthe village of Maiquetia with its cocoa-trees, La Guayra, and the\r\nvessels in the port. But I found this view far more extraordinary,\r\nwhen the sky was not serene, and when trains of clouds, strongly\r\nillumined on their upper surface, seemed projected like floating\r\nislands on the ocean. Strata of vapour, hovering at different\r\nheights, formed intermediary spaces between the eye and the lower\r\nregions. By an illusion easily explained, they enlarged the scene,\r\nand rendered it more majestic. Trees and dwellings appeared at\r\nintervals through the openings, which were left by the clouds when\r\ndriven on by the winds, and rolling over one another. Objects then\r\nappear at a greater depth than when seen through a pure and\r\nuniformly serene air. On the declivity of the mountains of Mexico,\r\nat the same height (between Las Trancas and Xalapa), the sea is\r\ntwelve leagues distant, and the view of the coast is confused;\r\nwhile on the road from La Guayra to Caracas we command the plains\r\n(the tierra caliente), as from the top of a tower. How\r\nextraordinary must be the impression created by this prospect on\r\nnatives of the inland parts of the country, who behold the sea and\r\nships for the first time from this point.\r\n\r\nI determined by direct observations the latitude of La Venta, that\r\nI might be enabled to give a more precise idea of the distance of\r\nthe coasts. The latitude is 10 degrees 33 minutes 9 seconds. Its\r\nlongitude appeared to me by the chronometer, nearly 2 minutes 47\r\nseconds west of the town of Caracas. I found the dip of the needle\r\nat this height to be 41.75 degrees, and the intensity of the\r\nmagnetic forces equal to two hundred and thirty-four oscillations.\r\nFrom the Venta, called also La Venta Grande, to distinguish it from\r\nthree or four small inns formerly established along the road, but\r\nnow destroyed, there is still an ascent of one hundred and fifty\r\ntoises to Guayavo. This is nearly the most lofty point of the road.\r\n\r\nWhether we gaze on the distant horizon of the sea, or turn our eyes\r\nsouth-eastward, in the direction of the serrated ridge of rocks,\r\nwhich seems to unite the Cumbre and the Silla, though separated\r\nfrom them by the ravine (quebrada) of Tocume, everywhere we admire\r\nthe grand character of the landscape. From Guayavo we proceed for\r\nhalf an hour over a smooth table-land, covered with alpine plants.\r\nThis part of the way, on account of its windings, is called Las\r\nVueltas. We find a little higher up the barracks or magazines of\r\nflour, which were constructed in a spot of cool temperature by the\r\nGuipuzcoa Company, when they had the exclusive monopoly of the\r\ntrade of Caracas, and supplied that place with provision. On the\r\nroad to Las Vueltas we see for the first time the capital, situated\r\nthree hundred toises below, in a valley luxuriantly planted with\r\ncoffee and European fruit-trees. Travellers are accustomed to halt\r\nnear a fine spring, known by the name of Fuente de Sanchorquiz,\r\nwhich flows down from the Sierra on sloping strata of gneiss. I\r\nfound its temperature 16.4 degrees; which, for an elevation of\r\nseven hundred and twenty-six toises, is considerably cool, and it\r\nwould appear much cooler to those who drink its limpid water, if,\r\ninstead of gushing out between La Cumbre and the temperate valley\r\nof Caracas, it were found on the descent towards La Guayra. But at\r\nthis descent on the northern side of the mountain, the rock, by an\r\nuncommon exception in this country, does not dip to north-west, but\r\nto south-east, which prevents the subterranean waters from forming\r\nsprings there.\r\n\r\nWe continued to descend from the small ravine of Sanchorquiz to la\r\nCruz de la Guayra, a cross erected on an open spot, six hundred and\r\nthirty-two toises high, and thence (entering by the custom-house\r\nand the quarter of the Pastora) to the city of Caracas. On the\r\nsouth side of the mountain of Avila, the gneiss presents several\r\ngeognostical phenomena worthy of the attention of travellers. It is\r\ntraversed by veins of quartz, containing cannulated and often\r\narticulated prisms of rutile titanite two or three lines in\r\ndiameter. In the fissures of the quartz we find, on breaking it,\r\nvery thin crystals, which crossing each other form a kind of\r\nnetwork. Sometimes the red schorl occurs only in dendritic crystals\r\nof a bright red.* (* Especially below the Cross of La Guayra, at\r\n594 toises of absolute elevation.) The gneiss of the valley of\r\nCaracas is characterized by the red and green garnets it contains;\r\nthey however disappear when the rock passes into mica-slate. This\r\nsame phenomenon has been remarked by Von Buch in Sweden; but in the\r\ntemperate parts of Europe garnets are in general contained in\r\nserpentine and mica-slates, not in gneiss. In the walls which\r\nenclose the gardens of Caracas, constructed partly of fragments of\r\ngneiss, we find garnets of a very fine red, a little transparent,\r\nand very difficult to detach. The gneiss near the Cross of La\r\nGuayra, half a league from Caracas, presented also vestiges of\r\nazure copper-ore* (* Blue carbonate of copper.) disseminated in\r\nveins of quartz, and small strata of plumbago (black lead), or\r\nearthy carburetted iron. This last is found in pretty large masses,\r\nand sometimes mingled with sparry iron-ore, in the ravine of\r\nTocume, to the west of the Silla.\r\n\r\nBetween the spring of Sanchorquiz and the Cross of La Guayra, as\r\nwell as still higher up, the gneiss contains considerable beds of\r\nsaccharoidal bluish-grey primitive limestone, coarse-grained,\r\ncontaining mica, and traversed by veins of white calcareous spar.\r\nThe mica, with large folia, lies in the direction of the dip of the\r\nstrata. I found in the primitive limestone a great many\r\ncrystallized pyrites, and rhomboidal fragments of sparry iron-ore\r\nof Isabella yellow. I endeavoured, but without success, to find\r\ntremolite (Grammatite of Hauy. The primitive limestone above the\r\nspring of Sanchorquiz, is directed, as the gneiss in that place,\r\nhor. 5.2, and dips 45 degrees north; but the general direction of\r\nthe gneiss is, in the Cerro de Avila, hor. 3.4 with 60 degrees of\r\ndip north-west. Exceptions merely local are observed in a small\r\nspace of ground near the Cross of La Guayra (hor. 6.2, dip 8\r\ndegrees north); and higher up, opposite the Quebrada of Tipe (hor.\r\n12, dip 50 degrees west).), which in the Fichtelberg, in Franconia,\r\nis common in the primitive limestone without dolomite. In Europe\r\nbeds of primitive limestone are generally observed in the\r\nmica-slates; but we find also saccharoidal limestone in gneiss of\r\nthe most ancient formation, in Sweden near Upsala, in Saxony near\r\nBurkersdorf, and in the Alps in the road over the Simplon. These\r\nsituations are analogous to that of Caracas. The phenomena of\r\ngeognosy, particularly those which are connected with the\r\nstratification of rocks, and their grouping, are never solitary;\r\nbut are found the same in both hemispheres. I was the more struck\r\nwith these relations, and this identity of formations, as, at the\r\ntime of my journey in these countries, mineralogists were\r\nunacquainted with the name of a single rock of Venezuela, New\r\nGrenada, and the Cordilleras of Quito.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.12.\r\n\r\nGENERAL VIEW OF THE PROVINCES OF VENEZUELA.\r\nDIVERSITY OF THEIR INTERESTS.\r\nCITY AND VALLEY OF CARACAS.\r\nCLIMATE.\r\n\r\nIn all those parts of Spanish America in which civilization did not\r\nexist to a certain degree before the Conquest (as it did in Mexico,\r\nGuatimala, Quito, and Peru), it has advanced from the coasts to the\r\ninterior of the country, following sometimes the valley of a great\r\nriver, sometimes a chain of mountains, affording a temperate\r\nclimate. Concentrated at once in different points, it has spread as\r\nif by diverging rays. The union into provinces and kingdoms was\r\neffected on the first immediate contact between civilized parts, or\r\nat least those subject to permanent and regular government. Lands\r\ndeserted, or inhabited by savage tribes, now surround the countries\r\nwhich European civilization has subdued. They divide its conquests\r\nlike arms of the sea difficult to be passed, and neighbouring\r\nstates are often connected with each other only by slips of\r\ncultivated land. It is less difficult to acquire a knowledge of the\r\nconfiguration of coasts washed by the ocean, than of the\r\nsinuosities of that interior shore, on which barbarism and\r\ncivilization, impenetrable forests and cultivated land, touch and\r\nbound each other. From not having reflected on the early state of\r\nsociety in the New World, geographers have often made their maps\r\nincorrect, by marking the different parts of the Spanish and\r\nPortuguese colonies, as though they were contiguous at every point\r\nin the interior. The local knowledge which I obtained respecting\r\nthese boundaries, enables me to fix the extent of the great\r\nterritorial divisions with some certainty, to compare the wild and\r\ninhabited parts, and to appreciate the degree of political\r\ninfluence exercised by certain towns of America, as centres of\r\npower and of commerce.\r\n\r\nCaracas is the capital of a country nearly twice as large as Peru,\r\nand now little inferior in extent to the kingdom of New Grenada.*\r\n(* The Capitania-General of Caracas contains near 48,000 square\r\nleagues (twenty-five to a degree). Peru, since La Paz, Potosi,\r\nCharcas and Santa Cruz de la Sierra, have been separated from it,\r\ncontains only 30,000. New Grenada, including the province of Quito,\r\ncontains 65,000. Reinos, Capitanias-Generales, Presidencies,\r\nGoviernos, and Provincias, are the names by which Spain formerly\r\ndistinguished her transmarine possessions, or, as they were called,\r\nDominios de Ultramar (Dominions beyond Sea.)) This country which\r\nthe Spanish government designates by the name of Capitania-General\r\nde Caracas,* (* The captain-general of Caracas has the title of\r\n\"Capitan-General de las Provincias de Venezuela y Ciudad do\r\nCaracas.\") or of the united provinces of Venezuela, has nearly a\r\nmillion of inhabitants, among whom are sixty thousand slaves. It\r\ncomprises, along the coasts, New Andalusia, or the province of\r\nCumana (with the island of Margareta),* (* This island, near the\r\ncoast of Cumana, forms a separate govierno, depending immediately\r\non the captain-general of Caracas.) Barcelona, Venezuela or\r\nCaracas, Coro, and Maracaybo; in the interior, the provinces of\r\nVarinas and Guiana; the former situated on the rivers of Santo\r\nDomingo and the Apure, the latter stretching along the Orinoco, the\r\nCasiquiare, the Atabapo, and the Rio Negro. In a general view of\r\nthe seven united provinces of Terra Firma, we perceive that they\r\nform three distinct zones, extending from east to west.\r\n\r\nWe find, first, cultivated land along the sea-shore, and near the\r\nchain of the mountains on the coast; next, savannahs or pasturages;\r\nand finally, beyond the Orinoco, a third zone, that of the forests,\r\ninto which we can penetrate only by the rivers which traverse them.\r\nIf the native inhabitants of the forests lived entirely on the\r\nproduce of the chase, like those of the Missouri, we might say that\r\nthe three zones into which we have divided the territory of\r\nVenezuela, picture the three states of human society; the life of\r\nthe wild hunter, in the woods of the Orinoco; pastoral life, in the\r\nsavannahs or llanos; and the agricultural state, in the high\r\nvalleys, and at the foot of the mountains on the coast. Missionary\r\nmonks and some few soldiers occupy here, as throughout all Spanish\r\nAmerica, advanced posts along the frontiers of Brazil. In this\r\nfirst zone are felt the preponderance of force, and the abuse of\r\npower, which is its necessary consequence. The natives carry on\r\ncivil war, and sometimes devour one another. The monks endeavour to\r\naugment the number of little villages of their Missions, by taking\r\nadvantage of the dissensions of the natives. The military live in a\r\nstate of hostility to the monks, whom they were intended to\r\nprotect. Everything presents a melancholy picture of misery and\r\nprivation. We shall soon have occasion to examine more closely that\r\nstate of man, which is vaunted as a state of nature, by those who\r\ninhabit towns. In the second region, in the plains and\r\npasture-grounds, food is extremely abundant, but has little\r\nvariety. Although more advanced in civilization, the people beyond\r\nthe circle of some scattered towns are not less isolated from one\r\nanother. At sight of their dwellings, partly covered with skins and\r\nleather, it might be supposed that, far from being fixed, they are\r\nscarcely encamped in those vast plains which extend to the horizon.\r\nAgriculture, which alone consolidates the bases, and strengthens\r\nthe bonds of society, occupies the third zone, the shore, and\r\nespecially the hot and temperate valleys among the mountains near\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\nIt may be objected, that in other parts of Spanish and Portuguese\r\nAmerica, wherever we can trace the progressive development of\r\ncivilization, we find the three ages of society combined. But it\r\nmust be remembered that the position of the three zones, that of\r\nthe forests, the pastures, and the cultivated land, is not\r\neverywhere the same, and that it is nowhere so regular as in\r\nVenezuela. It is not always from the coast to the interior, that\r\npopulation, commercial industry, and intellectual improvement,\r\ndiminish. In Mexico, Peru, and Quito, the table-lands and central\r\nmountains possess the greatest number of cultivators, the most\r\nnumerous towns situated near to each other, and the most ancient\r\ninstitutions. We even find, that, in the kingdom of Buenos Ayres,\r\nthe region of pasturage, known by the name of the Pampas, lies\r\nbetween the isolated part of Buenos Ayres and the great mass of\r\nIndian cultivators, who inhabit the Cordilleras of Charcas, La Paz,\r\nand Potosi. This circumstance gives birth to a diversity of\r\ninterests, in the same country, between the people of the interior\r\nand those who inhabit the coasts.\r\n\r\nTo form an accurate idea of those vast provinces which have been\r\ngoverned for ages, almost like separate states, by viceroys and\r\ncaptains-general, we must fix our attention at once on several\r\npoints. We must distinguish the parts of Spanish America opposite\r\nto Asia from those on the shores of the Atlantic; we must ascertain\r\nwhere the greater portion of the population is placed; whether near\r\nthe coast, or concentrated in the interior, on the cold and\r\ntemperate table-lands of the Cordilleras. We must verify the\r\nnumerical proportions between the natives and other castes; search\r\ninto the origin of the European families, and examine to what race,\r\nin each part of the colonies, belongs the greater number of whites.\r\nThe Andalusian-Canarians of Venezuela, the Mountaineers* (*\r\nMontaneses. The inhabitants of the mountains of Santander are\r\ncalled by this name in Spain.) and the Biscayans of Mexico, the\r\nCatalonians of Buenos Ayres, differ essentially in their aptitude\r\nfor agriculture, for the mechanical arts, for commerce, and for all\r\nobjects connected with intellectual development. Each of those\r\nraces has preserved, in the New as in the Old World, the shades\r\nthat constitute its national physiognomy; its asperity or mildness\r\nof character; its freedom from sordid feelings, or its excessive\r\nlove of gain; its social hospitality, or its taste for solitude. In\r\nthe countries where the population is for the most part composed of\r\nIndians and mixed races, the difference between the Europeans and\r\ntheir descendants cannot indeed be so strongly marked, as that\r\nwhich existed anciently in the colonies of Ionian and Doric origin.\r\nThe Spaniards transplanted to the torrid zone, estranged from the\r\nhabits of their mother-country, must have felt more sensible\r\nchanges than the Greeks settled on the coasts of Asia Minor, and of\r\nItaly, where the climates differ so little from those of Athens and\r\nCorinth. It cannot be denied that the character of the Spanish\r\nAmericans has been variously modified by the physical nature of the\r\ncountry; the isolated sites of the capitals on the table-lands or\r\nin the vicinity of the coasts; the agricultural life; the labour of\r\nthe mines, and the habit of commercial speculation: but in the\r\ninhabitants of Caracas, Santa Fe, Quito, and Buenos Ayres, we\r\nrecognize everywhere something which belongs to the race and the\r\nfiliation of the people.\r\n\r\nIf we examine the state of the Capitania-General of Caracas,\r\naccording to the principles here laid down, we perceive that\r\nagricultural industry, the great mass of population, the numerous\r\ntowns, and everything connected with advanced civilization, are\r\nfound near the coast. This coast extends along a space of two\r\nhundred leagues. It is washed by the Caribbean Sea, a sort of\r\nMediterranean, on the shores of which almost all the nations of\r\nEurope have founded colonies; which communicates at several points\r\nwith the Atlantic; and which has had a considerable influence on\r\nthe progress of knowledge in the eastern part of equinoctial\r\nAmerica, from the time of the Conquest. The kingdoms of New Grenada\r\nand Mexico have no connection with foreign colonies, and through\r\nthem with the nations of Europe, except by the ports of Carthagena,\r\nof Santa Martha, of Vera Cruz, and of Campeachy. These vast\r\ncountries, from the nature of their coasts, and the isolation of\r\ntheir inhabitants on the back of the Cordilleras, have few points\r\nof contact with foreign lands. The gulf of Mexico also is but\r\nlittle frequented during a part of the year, on account of the\r\ndanger of gales of wind from the north. The coasts of Venezuela, on\r\nthe contrary, from their extent, their eastward direction, the\r\nnumber of their ports, and the safety of their anchorage at\r\ndifferent seasons, possess all the advantages of the Caribbean Sea.\r\nThe communications with the larger islands, and even with those\r\nsituated to windward, can nowhere be more frequent than from the\r\nports of Cumana, Barcelona, La Guayra, Porto Cabello, Coro, and\r\nMaracaybo. Can we wonder that this facility of commercial\r\nintercourse with the inhabitants of free America, and the agitated\r\nnations of Europe, should in the provinces united under the\r\nCapitania-General of Venezuela, have augmented opulence, knowledge,\r\nand that restless desire of a local government, which is blended\r\nwith the love of liberty and republican forms?\r\n\r\nThe copper-coloured natives, or Indians, constitute an important\r\nmass of the agricultural population only in those places where the\r\nSpaniards, at the time of the Conquest, found regular governments,\r\nsocial communities, and ancient and very complicated institutions;\r\nas, for example, in New Spain, south of Durango; and in Peru, from\r\nCuzco to Potosi. In the Capitania-General of Caracas, the Indian\r\npopulation is inconsiderable, at least beyond the Missions and in\r\nthe cultivated zone. Even in times of great political excitement,\r\nthe natives do not inspire any apprehension in the whites or the\r\nmixed castes. Computing, in 1800, the total population of the seven\r\nunited provinces at nine hundred thousand souls, it appeared to me\r\nthat the Indians made only one-ninth; while at Mexico they form\r\nnearly one half of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nConsidering the Caribbean Sea, of which the gulf of Mexico makes a\r\npart, as an interior sea with several mouths, it is important to\r\nfix our attention on the political relations arising out of this\r\nsingular configuration of the New Continent, between countries\r\nplaced around the same basin. Notwithstanding the isolated state in\r\nwhich most of the mother-countries endeavour to hold their\r\ncolonies, the agitations that take place are not the less\r\ncommunicated from one to the other. The elements of discord are\r\neverywhere the same; and, as if by instinct, an understanding is\r\nestablished between men of the same colour, although separated by\r\ndifference of language, and inhabiting opposite coasts. That\r\nAmerican Mediterranean formed by the shores of Venezuela, New\r\nGrenada, Mexico, the United States, and the West India Islands,\r\ncounts upon its borders near a million and a half of free and\r\nenslaved blacks; but so unequally distributed, that there are very\r\nfew to the south, and scarcely any in the regions of the west.\r\nTheir great accumulation is on the northern and eastern coasts,\r\nwhich may be said to be the African part of the interior basin. The\r\ncommotions which since 1792 have broken out in St. Domingo, have\r\nnaturally been propagated to the coasts of Venezuela. So long as\r\nSpain possessed those fine colonies in tranquillity, the little\r\ninsurrections of the slaves were easily repressed; but when a\r\nstruggle of another kind, that for independence, began, the blacks\r\nby their menacing position excited alternately the apprehensions of\r\nthe opposite parties; and the gradual or instantaneous abolition of\r\nslavery has been proclaimed in different regions of Spanish\r\nAmerica, less from motives of justice and humanity, than to secure\r\nthe aid of an intrepid race of men, habituated to privation, and\r\nfighting for their own cause. I found in the narrative of the\r\nvoyage of Girolamo Benzoni, a curious passage, which proves that\r\nthe apprehensions caused by the increase of the black population\r\nare of very old date. These apprehensions will cease only where\r\ngovernments shall second by laws the progressive reforms which\r\nrefinement of manners, opinion, and religious sentiment, introduce\r\ninto domestic slavery. \"The negroes,\" says Benzoni, \"multiply so\r\nmuch at St. Domingo, that in 1545, when I was in Terra Firma [on\r\nthe coast of Caracas], I saw many Spaniards who had no doubt that\r\nthe island would shortly be the property of the blacks.\"* (* \"Vi\r\nsono molti Spagnuoli che tengono per cosa certa, che quest' isola\r\n(San Dominico) in breve tempo sara posseduta da questi Mori di\r\nGuinea.\" (Benzoni Istoria del Mondo Nuovo ediz. 2da 1672 page 65.)\r\nThe author, who is not very scrupulous in the adoption of\r\nstatistical facts, believes that in his time there were at St.\r\nDomingo seven thousand fugitive negroes (Mori cimaroni), with whom\r\nDon Luis Columbus made a treaty of peace and friendship.) It was\r\nreserved for our age to see this prediction accomplished; and a\r\nEuropean colony of America transform itself into an African state.\r\n\r\nThe sixty thousand slaves which the seven united provinces of\r\nVenezuela are computed to contain, are so unequally divided, that\r\nin the province of Caracas alone there are nearly forty thousand,\r\none-fifth of whom are mulattoes; in Maracaybo, there are ten or\r\ntwelve thousand; but in Cumana and Barcelona, scarcely six\r\nthousand. To judge of the influence which the slaves and men of\r\ncolour exercise on the public tranquility, it is not enough to know\r\ntheir number, we must consider their accumulation at certain\r\npoints, and their manner of life, as cultivators or inhabitants of\r\ntowns. In the province of Venezuela, the slaves are assembled\r\ntogether on a space of no great extent, between the coast, and a\r\nline which passes (at twelve leagues from the coast) through\r\nPanaquire, Yare, Sabana de Ocumare, Villa de Cura, and Nirgua. The\r\nllanos or vast plains of Calaboso, San Carlos, Guanare, and\r\nBarquecimeto, contain only four or five thousand slaves, who are\r\nscattered among the farms, and employed in the care of cattle. The\r\nnumber of free men is very considerable; the Spanish laws and\r\ncustoms being favourable to affranchisement. A master cannot refuse\r\nliberty to a slave who offers him the sum of three hundred\r\npiastres, even though the slave may have cost double that price, on\r\naccount of his industry, or a particular aptitude for the trade he\r\npractises. Instances of persons who voluntarily bestow liberty on a\r\ncertain number of their slaves, are more common in the province of\r\nVenezuela than in any other place. A short time before we visited\r\nthe fertile valleys of Aragua and the lake of Valencia, a lady who\r\ninhabited the great village of Victoria, ordered her children, on\r\nher death-bed, to give liberty to all her slaves, thirty in number.\r\nI feel pleasure in recording facts that do honour to the character\r\nof a people from whom M. Bonpland and myself received so many marks\r\nof kindness.\r\n\r\nIf we compare the seven united provinces of Venezuela with the\r\nkingdom of Mexico and the island of Cuba, we shall succeed in\r\nfinding the approximate number of white Creoles, and even of\r\nEuropeans. The white Creoles, whom I may call Hispano-Americans,*\r\n(* In imitation of the word Anglo-American, adapted in all the\r\nlanguages of Europe. In the Spanish colonies, the whites born in\r\nAmerica are called Spaniards; and the real Spaniards, those born in\r\nthe mother country, are called Europeans, Gachupins, or Chapetons.)\r\nform in Mexico nearly a fifth, and in the island of Cuba, according\r\nto the very accurate enumeration of 1801, a third of the whole\r\npopulation. When we reflect that the kingdom of Mexico contains two\r\nmillions and a half of natives of the copper-coloured race; when we\r\nconsider the state of the coasts bordering on the Pacific, and the\r\nsmall number of whites in the intendencias of Puebla and Oaxaca,\r\ncompared with the natives, we cannot doubt that the province of\r\nVenezuela at least, if not the capitania-general, has a greater\r\nproportion than that of one to five. The island of Cuba,* (* I do\r\nnot mention the kingdom of Buenos Ayres, where, among a million of\r\ninhabitants, the whites are extremely numerous in parts near the\r\ncoast; while the table-lands, or provinces of the sierra are almost\r\nentirely peopled with natives.) in which the whites are even more\r\nnumerous than in Chile, may furnish us with a limiting number, that\r\nis to say, the maximum which may be supposed in the\r\ncapitania-general of Caracas. I believe we must stop at two\r\nhundred, or two hundred and ten thousand Hispano-Americans, in a\r\ntotal population of nine hundred thousand souls. The number of\r\nEuropeans included in the white race (not comprehending the troops\r\nsent from the mother-country) does not exceed twelve or fifteen\r\nthousand. It certainly is not greater at Mexico than sixty\r\nthousand; and I find by several statements, that, if we estimate\r\nthe whole of the Spanish colonies at fourteen or fifteen millions\r\nof inhabitants, there are in that number at most three millions of\r\nCreole whites, and two hundred thousand Europeans.\r\n\r\nWhen Tupac-Amaru, who believed himself to be the legitimate heir to\r\nthe empire of the Incas, made the conquest of several provinces of\r\nUpper Peru, in 1781, at the head of forty thousand Indian\r\nmountaineers, all the whites were filled with alarm. The\r\nHispano-Americans felt, like the Spaniards born in Europe, that the\r\ncontest was between the copper-coloured race and the whites;\r\nbetween barbarism and civilization. Tupac-Amaru, who himself was\r\nnot destitute of intellectual cultivation, began with flattering\r\nthe creoles and the European clergy; but soon, impelled by events,\r\nand by the spirit of vengeance that inspired his nephew, Andres\r\nCondorcanqui, he changed his plan. A rising for independence became\r\na cruel war between the different castes; the whites were\r\nvictorious, and excited by a feeling of common interest, from that\r\nperiod they kept watchful attention on the proportions existing in\r\nthe different provinces between their numbers and those of the\r\nIndians. It was reserved for our times to see the whites direct\r\nthis attention towards themselves; and examine, from motives of\r\ndistrust, the elements of which their own caste is composed. Every\r\nenterprise in favour of independence and liberty puts the national\r\nor American party in opposition to the men of the mother-country.\r\nWhen I arrived at Caracas, the latter had just escaped from the\r\ndanger with which they thought they were menaced by the\r\ninsurrection projected by Espana. The consequences of that bold\r\nattempt were the more deplorable, because, instead of investigating\r\nthe real causes of the popular discontent, it was thought that the\r\nmother-country would be saved by employing vigorous measures. At\r\npresent, the commotions which have arisen throughout the country,\r\nfrom the banks of the Rio de la Plata to New Mexico, an extent of\r\nfourteen hundred leagues, have divided men of a common origin.\r\n\r\nThe Indian population in the united provinces of Venezuela is not\r\nconsiderable, and is but recently civilized. All the towns were\r\nfounded by the Spanish conquerors, who could not carry out, as in\r\nMexico and Peru, the old civilization of the natives. Caracas,\r\nMaracaybo, Cumana, and Coro, have nothing Indian but their names.\r\nCompared with the three capitals of equinoctial America,* (*\r\nMexico, Santa Fe de Bogota, and Quito. The elevation of the site of\r\nthe capital of Guatimala is still unknown. Judging from the\r\nvegetation, we may infer that it is less than 500 toises.) situated\r\non the mountains, and enjoying a temperate climate, Caracas is the\r\nleast elevated. It is not a central point of commerce, like Mexico,\r\nSanta Fe de Bogota, and Quito. Each of the seven provinces united\r\nin one capitania-general has a port, by which its produce is\r\nexported. It is sufficient to consider the position of the\r\nprovinces, their respective degree of intercourse with the Windward\r\nIslands, the direction of the mountains, and the course of the\r\ngreat rivers, to perceive that Caracas can never exercise any\r\npowerful political influence over the territories of which it is\r\nthe capital. The Apure, the Meta, and the Orinoco, running from\r\nwest to east, receive all the streams of the llanos, or the region\r\nof pasturage. St. Thomas de la Guiana will necessarily, at some\r\nfuture day, be a trading-place of high importance, especially when\r\nthe flour of New Grenada, embarked above the confluence of the Rio\r\nNegro and the Umadea, and descending by the Meta and Orinoco, shall\r\nbe preferred at Caracas and Guiana to the flour of New England. It\r\nis a great advantage to the provinces of Venezuela, that their\r\nterritorial wealth is not directed to one point, like that of\r\nMexico and New Grenada, which flows to Vera Cruz and Carthagena;\r\nbut that they possess a great number of towns equally well peopled,\r\nand forming various centres of commerce and civilization.\r\n\r\nThe city of Caracas is seated at the entrance of the plain of\r\nChacao, which extends three leagues eastward, in the direction of\r\nCaurimare and the Cuesta de Auyamas, and is two leagues and a half\r\nin breadth. This plain, through which runs the Rio Guayra, is at\r\nthe elevation of four hundred and fourteen toises above the level\r\nof the sea. The ground on which the city of Caracas is built is\r\nuneven, and has a steep slope from north-north-west to\r\nsouth-south-east. To form an accurate idea of the situation of\r\nCaracas, we must bear in mind the general direction of the\r\nmountains of the coast, and the great longitudinal valleys by which\r\nthey are traversed. The Rio Guayra rises in the group of primitive\r\nmountains of Higuerote, which separates the valley of Caracas from\r\nthat of Aragua. It is formed near Las Ajuntas, by the junction of\r\nthe little rivers of San Pedro and Macarao, and runs first eastward\r\nas far as the Cuesta of Auyamas, and then southward, uniting its\r\nwaters with those of the Rio Tuy, below Yare. The Rio Tuy is the\r\nonly considerable river in the northern and mountainous part of the\r\nprovince.\r\n\r\nThe river flows in a direct course from west to east, the distance\r\nof thirty leagues, and it is navigable along more than three\r\nquarters of that distance. By barometrical measurements I found the\r\nslope of the Tuy along this length, from the plantation of\r\nManterola* (* At the foot of the high mountain of Cocuyza, 3 east\r\nfrom Victoria.) to its mouth, east of Cape Codera, to be two\r\nhundred and ninety-five toises. This river forms in the chain of\r\nthe coast a kind of longitudinal valley, while the waters of the\r\nllanos, or of five-sixths of the province of Caracas, follow the\r\nslope of the land southward, and join the Orinoco. This\r\nhydrographic sketch may throw some light on the natural tendency of\r\nthe inhabitants of each particular province, to export their\r\nproductions by different roads.\r\n\r\nThe valleys of Caracas and of the Tuy run parallel for a\r\nconsiderable length. They are separated by a mountainous tract,\r\nwhich is crossed in going from Caracas to the high savannahs of\r\nOcumare, passing by La Valle and Salamanca. These savannahs\r\nthemselves are beyond the Tuy; and the valley of the Tuy being a\r\ngreat deal lower than that of Caracas, the descent is almost\r\nconstantly from north to south. As Cape Codera, the Silla, the\r\nCerro de Avila between Caracas and La Guayra, and the mountains of\r\nMariara, constitute the most northern and elevated range of the\r\ncoast chain; so the mountains of Panaquire, Ocumare, Guiripa, and\r\nof the Villa de Cura, form the most southern range. The general\r\ndirection of the strata composing this vast chain of the coast is\r\nfrom south-east to north-west; and the dip is generally towards\r\nnorth-west: hence it follows, that the direction of the primitive\r\nstrata is independent of that of the whole chain. It is extremely\r\nremarkable, tracing this chain* from Porto Cabello as far as\r\nManiquarez and Macanao, in the island of Margareta (* I have\r\nspoken, in the preceding chapter, of the interruption in the chain\r\nof the coast to the east of Cape Codera.), to find, from west to\r\neast, first granite, then gneiss, mica-slate, and primitive schist;\r\nand finally, compact limestone, gypsum, and conglomerates\r\ncontaining sea-shells.\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that the town of Caracas was not built\r\nfarther to the east, below the entrance of the Anauco into the\r\nGuayra; on that spot near Chacao, where the valley widens into an\r\nextensive plain, which seems to have been levelled by the waters.\r\nDiego de Losada, when he founded* the town, followed no doubt the\r\ntraces of the first establishment made by Faxardo. At that time,\r\nthe Spaniards, attracted by the high repute of the two gold mines\r\nof Los Teques and Baruta, were not yet masters of the whole valley,\r\nand preferred remaining near the road leading to the coast. (* The\r\nfoundation of Santiago de Leon de Caracas dates from 1567, and is\r\nposterior to that of Cumana, Coro, Nueva Barcelona, and\r\nCaravalleda, or El Collado.) The town of Quito is also built in the\r\nnarrowest and most uneven part of a valley, between two fine\r\nplains, Turupamba and Rumipamba.\r\n\r\nThe descent is uninterrupted from the custom-house of the Pastora,\r\nby the square of Trinidad and the Plaza Mayor, to Santa Rosalia,\r\nand the Rio Guayra. This declivity of the ground does not prevent\r\ncarriages from going about the town; but the inhabitants make\r\nlittle use of them. Three small rivers, descending from the\r\nmountains, the Anauco, the Catuche, and the Caraguata, intersect\r\nthe town, running from north to south. Their banks are very high;\r\nand, with the dried-up ravines which join them, furrowing the\r\nground, they remind the traveller of the famous Guaicos of Quito,\r\nonly on a smaller scale. The water used for drinking at Caracas is\r\nthat of the Rio Catuche; but the richer class of the inhabitants\r\nhave their water brought from La Valle, a village a league distant\r\non the south. This water and that of Gamboa are considered very\r\nsalubrious, because they flow over the roots of sarsaparilla.* (*\r\nThroughout America water is supposed to share the properties of\r\nthose plants under the shade of which it flows. Thus, at the\r\nStraits of Magellan, that water is much praised which comes in\r\ncontact with the roots of the Canella winterana.) I could not\r\ndiscover in them any aromatic or extractive matter. The water of\r\nthe valley does not contain lime, but a little more carbonic acid\r\nthan the water of the Anauco. The new bridge over this river is a\r\nhandsome structure. Caracas contains eight churches, five convents,\r\nand a theatre capable of holding fifteen or eighteen hundred\r\npersons. When I was there, the pit, in which the seats of the men\r\nare apart from those of the women, was uncovered. By this means the\r\nspectators could either look at the actors or gaze at the stars. As\r\nthe misty weather made me lose a great many observations of\r\nJupiter's satellites, I was able to ascertain, as I sat in a box in\r\nthe theatre, whether the planet would be visible that night. The\r\nstreets of Caracas are wide and straight, and they cross each other\r\nat right angles, as in all the towns built by the Spaniards in\r\nAmerica. The houses are spacious, and higher than they ought to be\r\nin a country subject to earthquakes. In 1800, the two squares of\r\nAlta Gracia and San Francisco presented a very agreeable aspect; I\r\nsay in the year 1800, because the terrible shocks of the 26th of\r\nMarch, 1812, almost destroyed the whole city, which is only now\r\nslowly rising from its ruins. The quarter of Trinidad, in which I\r\nresided, was destroyed as completely as if a mine had been sprung\r\nbeneath it.\r\n\r\nThe small extent of the valley, and the proximity of the high\r\nmountains of Avila and the Silla, give a gloomy and stern character\r\nto the scenery of Caracas; particularly in that part of the year\r\nwhen the coolest temperature prevails, namely, in the months of\r\nNovember and December. The mornings are then very fine; and on a\r\nclear and serene sky we could perceive the two domes or rounded\r\npyramids of the Silla, and the craggy ridge of the Cerro de Avila.\r\nBut towards evening the atmosphere thickens; the mountains are\r\noverhung with clouds; streams of vapour cling to their evergreen\r\nslopes, and seem to divide them into zones one above another. These\r\nzones are gradually blended together; the cold air which descends\r\nfrom the Silla, accumulates in the valley, and condenses the light\r\nvapours into large fleecy clouds. These often descend below the\r\nCross of La Guayra, and advance, gliding on the soil, in the\r\ndirection of the Pastora of Caracas, and the adjacent quarter of\r\nTrinidad. Beneath this misty sky, I could scarcely imagine myself\r\nto be in one of the temperate valleys of the torrid zone; but\r\nrather in the north of Germany, among the pines and the larches\r\nthat cover the mountains of the Hartz.\r\n\r\nBut this gloomy aspect, this contrast between the clearness of\r\nmorning and the cloudy sky of evening, is not observable in the\r\nmidst of summer. The nights of June and July are clear and\r\ndelicious. The atmosphere then preserves, almost without\r\ninterruption, the purity and transparency peculiar to the\r\ntable-lands and elevated valleys of these regions in calm weather,\r\nas long as the winds do not mingle together strata of air of\r\nunequal temperature. That is the season for enjoying the beauty of\r\nthe landscape, which, however, I saw clearly illumined only during\r\na few days at the end of January. The two rounded summits of the\r\nSilla are seen at Caracas, almost under the same angles of\r\nelevation* as the peak of Teneriffe at the port of Orotava.* (* I\r\nfound, at the square of Trinidad, the apparent height of the Silla\r\nto be 11 degrees 12 minutes 49 seconds. It was about four thousand\r\nfive hundred toises distant.) The first half of the mountain is\r\ncovered with short grass; then succeeds the zone of evergreen trees,\r\nreflecting a purple light at the season when the befaria, the\r\nalpine rose-tree* (* Rhododendron ferrugineum of the Alps.) of\r\nequinoctial America, is in blossom. The rocky masses rise above\r\nthis wooded zone in the form of domes. Being destitute of\r\nvegetation, they increase by the nakedness of their surface the\r\napparent height of a mountain which, in the temperate parts of\r\nEurope, would scarcely rise to the limit of perpetual snow. The\r\ncultivated region of the valley, and the gay plains of Chacao,\r\nPetare, and La Vega, form an agreeable contrast to the imposing\r\naspect of the Silla, and the great irregularities of the ground on\r\nthe north of the town.\r\n\r\nThe climate of Caracas has often been called a perpetual spring.\r\nThe same sort of climate exists everywhere, halfway up the\r\nCordilleras of equinoctial America, between four hundred and nine\r\nhundred toises of elevation, except in places where the great\r\nbreadth of the valleys, combined with an arid soil, causes an\r\nextraordinary intensity* of radiant caloric. (* As at Carthago and\r\nIbague in New Grenada.) What can we conceive to be more delightful\r\nthan a temperature which in the day keeps between 20 and 26 degrees\r\n(Between 16 and 20.8 degrees Reaum.); and at night between 16 and\r\n18 degrees (Between 12.8 and 14.4 degrees Reaum.), which is equally\r\nfavourable to the plantain, the orange-tree, the coffee-tree, the\r\napple, the apricot, and corn? Jose de Oviedo y Banos, the\r\nhistoriographer of Venezuela, calls the situation of Caracas that\r\nof a terrestrial paradise, and compares the Anauco and the\r\nneighbouring torrents to the four rivers of the Garden of Eden.\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that this delightful climate is generally\r\ninconstant and variable. The inhabitants of Caracas complain of\r\nhaving several seasons in one and the same day; and of the rapid\r\nchange from one season to another. In the month of January, for\r\ninstance, a night, of which the mean temperature is 16 degrees, is\r\nsometimes followed by a day when the thermometer during eight\r\nsuccessive hours keeps above 22 degrees in the shade. In the same\r\nday, we may find the temperature of 24 and 18 degrees. These\r\nvariations are extremely common in our temperate climates of\r\nEurope, but in the torrid zone, Europeans themselves are so\r\naccustomed to the uniform action of exterior stimulus, that they\r\nsuffer from a change of temperature of 6 degrees. At Cumana, and\r\neverywhere in the plains, the temperature from eleven in the\r\nmorning to eleven at night changes only 2 or 3 degrees. Moreover,\r\nthese variations act on the human frame at Caracas more violently\r\nthan might be supposed from the mere indications of the\r\nthermometer. In this narrow valley the atmosphere is in some sort\r\nbalanced between two winds, one blowing from the west, or the\r\nseaside, the other from the east, or the inland country. The first\r\nis known by the name of the wind of Catia, because it blows from\r\nCatia westward of Cabo Blanco through the ravine of Tipe. It is,\r\nhowever, only a westerly wind in appearance, and it is oftener the\r\nbreeze of the east and north-east, which, rushing with extreme\r\nimpetuosity, engulfs itself in the Quebrada de Tipe. Rebounding\r\nfrom the high mountains of Aguas Negras, this wind finds its way\r\nback to Caracas, in the direction of the hospital of the Capuchins\r\nand the Rio Caraguata. It is loaded with vapours, which it deposits\r\nas its temperature decreases, and consequently the summit of the\r\nSilla is enveloped in clouds, when the catia blows in the valley.\r\nThis wind is dreaded by the inhabitants of Caracas; it causes\r\nheadache in persons whose nervous system is irritable. In order to\r\nshun its effects, people sometimes shut themselves up in their\r\nhouses, as they do in Italy when the sirocco is blowing. I thought\r\nI perceived, during my stay at Caracas, that the wind of Catia was\r\npurer (a little richer in oxygen) than the wind of Petare. I even\r\nimagined that its purity might explain its exciting property. The\r\nwind of Petare coming from the east and south-east, by the eastern\r\nextremity of the valley of the Guayra, brings from the mountains\r\nand the interior of the country, a drier air, which dissipates the\r\nclouds, and the summit of the Silla rises in all its beauty.\r\n\r\nWe know that the modifications produced by winds in the composition\r\nof the air in various places, entirely escape our eudiometrical\r\nexperiments, the most precise of which can estimate only as far\r\nas .0003 degrees of oxygen. Chemistry does not yet possess any\r\nmeans of distinguishing two jars of air, the one filled during the\r\nprevalence of the sirocco or the catia, and the other before these\r\nwinds have commenced. It appears to me probable, that the singular\r\neffects of the catia, and of all those currents of air, to the\r\ninfluence of which popular opinion attaches so much importance,\r\nmust be looked for rather in the changes of humidity and of\r\ntemperature, than in chemical modifications. We need not trace\r\nmiasms to Caracas from the unhealthy shore on the coast: it may be\r\neasily conceived that men accustomed to the drier air of the\r\nmountains and the interior, must be disagreeably affected when the\r\nvery humid air of the sea, pressed through the gap of Tipe, reaches\r\nin an ascending current the high valley of Caracas, and, getting\r\ncooler by dilatation, and by contact with the adjacent strata,\r\ndeposits a great portion of the water it contains. This inconstancy\r\nof climate, these somewhat rapid transitions from dry and\r\ntransparent to humid and misty air, are inconveniences which\r\nCaracas shares in common with the whole temperate region of the\r\ntropics--with all places situated between four and eight hundred\r\ntoises of elevation, either on table-lands of small extent, or on\r\nthe slope of the Cordilleras, as at Xalapa in Mexico, and Guaduas\r\nin New Granada. A serenity, uninterrupted during a great part of\r\nthe year, prevails only in the low regions at the level of the sea,\r\nand at considerable heights on those vast table-lands, where the\r\nuniform radiation of the soil seems to contribute to the perfect\r\ndissolution of vesicular vapours. The intermediate zone is at the\r\nsame height as the first strata of clouds which surround the\r\nsurface of the earth; and the climate of this zone, the temperature\r\nof which is so mild, is essentially misty and variable.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the elevation of the spot, the sky is generally\r\nless blue at Caracas than at Cumana. The aqueous vapour is less\r\nperfectly dissolved; and here, as in our climates, a greater\r\ndiffusion of light diminishes the intensity of the aerial colour,\r\nby introducing white into the blue of the air. This intensity,\r\nmeasured with the cyanometer of Saussure, was found from November\r\nto January generally 18, never above 20 degrees. On the coasts it\r\nwas from 22 to 25 degrees. I remarked, in the village of Caracas,\r\nthat the wind of Petare sometimes contributes singularly to give a\r\npale tint to the celestial vault. On the 22nd of January, the blue\r\nof the sky was at noon in the zenith feebler than I ever saw it in\r\nthe torrid zone.* (* At noon, thermometer in the shade 23.7 (in the\r\nsun, out of the wind, 30.4 degrees); De Luc's hygrometer, 36.2;\r\ncyanometer, at the zenith, 12, at the horizon 9 degrees. The wind\r\nceased at three in the afternoon. Thermometer 21; hygrometer 39.3;\r\ncyanometer 16 degrees. At six o'clock, thermometer 20.2; hygrometer\r\n39 degrees.) It corresponded only to 12 degrees of the cyanometer.\r\nThe atmosphere was then remarkably transparent, without clouds, and\r\nof extraordinary dryness. The moment the wind of Petare ceased, the\r\nblue colour rose at the zenith as high as 16 degrees. I have often\r\nobserved at sea, but in a smaller degree, a similar effect of the\r\nwind on the colour of the serenest sky.\r\n\r\nWe know less exactly the mean temperature of Caracas, than that of\r\nSanta Fe de Bogota and of Mexico. I believe, however, I can\r\ndemonstrate, that it cannot be very distant from twenty to\r\ntwenty-two degrees. I found by my own observations, during the\r\nthree very cool months of November, December, and January, taking\r\neach day the maximum and minimum of the temperature, the heights\r\nwere 20.2; 20.1; 20.2 degrees.\r\n\r\nRains are extremely frequent at Caracas in the months of April,\r\nMay, and June. The storms always come from the east and south-east,\r\nfrom the direction of Petare and La Valle. No hail falls in the low\r\nregions of the tropics; yet it occurs at Caracas almost every four\r\nor five years. Hail has even been seen in valleys still lower; and\r\nthis phenomenon, when it does happen, makes a powerful impression\r\non the people. Falls of aerolites are less rare with us than hail\r\nin the torrid zone, notwithstanding the frequency of thunder-storms\r\nat the elevation of three hundred toises above the level of the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nThe cool and delightful climate we have just been describing is\r\nalso suited for the culture of equinoctial productions. The\r\nsugar-cane is reared with success, even at heights exceeding that\r\nof Caracas; but in the valley, owing to the dryness of the climate,\r\nand the stony soil, the cultivation of the coffee-tree is\r\npreferred: it yields indeed but little fruit, but that little is of\r\nthe finest quality. When the shrub is in blossom, the plain\r\nextending beyond Chacao presents a delightful aspect. The\r\nbanana-tree, which is seen in the plantations near the town, is not\r\nthe great Platano harton; but the varieties camburi and dominico,\r\nwhich require less heat. The great plantains are brought to the\r\nmarket of Caracas from the haciendas of Turiamo, situated on the\r\ncoast between Burburata and Porto Cabello. The finest flavoured\r\npine-apples are those of Baruto, of Empedrado, and of the heights\r\nof Buenavista, on the road to Victoria. When a traveller for the\r\nfirst time visits the valley of Caracas, he is agreeably surprised\r\nto find the culinary plants of our climates, as well as the\r\nstrawberry, the vine, and almost all the fruit-trees of the\r\ntemperate zone, growing beside the coffee and banana-tree. The\r\napples and peaches esteemed the best come from Macarao, or from the\r\nwestern extremity of the valley. There, the quince-tree, the trunk\r\nof which attains only four or five feet in height, is so common,\r\nthat it has almost become wild. Preserved apples and quinces,\r\nparticularly the latter,* (* \"Dulce de manzana y de membrillo,\" are\r\nthe Spanish names of these preserves.) are much used in a country\r\nwhere it is thought that, before drinking water, thirst should be\r\nexcited by sweetmeats. In proportion as the environs of the town\r\nhave been planted with coffee, and the establishment of plantations\r\n(which dates only from the year 1795) has increased the number of\r\nagricultural negroes,* the apple and quince-trees scattered in the\r\nsavannahs have given place, in the valley of Caracas, to maize and\r\npulse. (* The consumption of provisions, especially meat, is so\r\nconsiderable in the towns of Spanish America, that at Caracas, in\r\n1800, there were 40,000 oxen killed every year: while in Paris, in\r\n1793, with a population fourteen times as great, the number\r\namounted only to 70,000.) Rice, watered by means of small trenches,\r\nwas formerly more common than it now is in the plain of Chacao. I\r\nobserved in this province, as in Mexico and in all the elevated\r\nlands of the torrid zone, that, where the apple-tree is most\r\nabundant, the culture of the pear-tree is attended with great\r\ndifficulty. I have been assured, that near Caracas the excellent\r\napples sold in the markets come from trees not grafted. There are\r\nno cherry-trees. The olive-trees which I saw in the court of the\r\nconvent of San Felipe de Neri, were large and fine; but the\r\nluxuriance of their vegetation prevented them from bearing fruit.\r\n\r\nIf the atmospheric constitution of the valley be favourable to the\r\ndifferent kinds of culture on which colonial industry is based, it\r\nis not equally favourable to the health of the inhabitants, or to\r\nthat of foreigners settled in the capital of Venezuela. The extreme\r\ninconstancy of the weather, and the frequent suppression of\r\ncutaneous perspiration, give birth to catarrhal affections, which\r\nassume the most various forms. A European, once accustomed to the\r\nviolent heat, enjoys better health at Cumana, in the valley of\r\nAragua, and in every place where the low region of the tropics is\r\nnot very humid, than at Caracas, and in those mountain-climates\r\nwhich are vaunted as the abode of perpetual spring.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the yellow fever of La Guayra, I mentioned the opinion\r\ngenerally adopted, that this disease is propagated as little from\r\nthe coast of Venezuela to the capital, as from the coast of Mexico\r\nto Xalapa. This opinion is founded on the experience of the last\r\ntwenty years. The contagious disorders which were severely felt in\r\nthe port of La Guayra, were scarcely felt at Caracas. I am not\r\nconvinced that the American typhus, rendered endemic on the coast\r\nas the port becomes more frequented, if favoured by particular\r\ndispositions of the climate, may not become common in the valley:\r\nfor the mean temperature of Caracas is considerable enough to allow\r\nthe thermometer, in the hottest months, to keep between twenty-two\r\nand twenty-six degrees. The situation of Xalapa, on the declivity\r\nof the Mexican mountains, promises more security, because that town\r\nis less populous, and is five times farther distant from the sea\r\nthan Caracas, and two hundred and thirty toises higher: its mean\r\ntemperature being three degrees cooler. In 1696, a bishop of\r\nVenezuela, Diego de Banos, dedicated a church (ermita) to Santa\r\nRosalia of Palermo, for having delivered the capital from the\r\nscourge of the black vomit (vomito negro), which is said to have\r\nraged for the space of sixteen months. A mass celebrated every year\r\nin the cathedral, in the beginning of September, perpetuates the\r\nremembrance of this epidemic, in the same manner as processions\r\nfix, in the Spanish colonies, the date of the great earthquakes.\r\nThe year 1696 was indeed very remarkable for the yellow fever,\r\nwhich raged with violence in all the West India Islands, where it\r\nhad only begun to gain an ascendancy in 1688. But how can we give\r\ncredit to an epidemical black vomit, having lasted sixteen months\r\nwithout interruption, and which may be said to have passed through\r\nthat very cool season when the thermometer at Caracas falls to\r\ntwelve or thirteen degrees? Can the typhus be of older date in the\r\nelevated valley of Caracas, than in the most frequented ports of\r\nTerra Firma. According to Ulloa, it was unknown in Terra Firma\r\nbefore 1729. I doubt, therefore, the epidemic of 1696 having been\r\nthe yellow fever, or real typhus of America. Some of the symptoms\r\nwhich accompany yellow fever are common to bilious remittent\r\nfevers; and are no more characteristic than haematemeses of that\r\nsevere disease now known at the Havannah and Vera Cruz by the name\r\nof vomito. But though no accurate description satisfactorily\r\ndemonstrates that the typhus of America existed at Caracas as early\r\nas the end of the seventeenth century, it is unhappily too certain,\r\nthat this disease carried off in that capital a great number of\r\nEuropean soldiers in 1802. We are filled with dismay when we\r\nreflect that, in the centre of the torrid zone, a table-land four\r\nhundred and fifty toises high, but very near the sea, does not\r\nsecure the inhabitants against a scourge which was believed to\r\nbelong only to the low regions of the coast.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.13.\r\n\r\nABODE AT CARACAS.\r\nMOUNTAINS IN THE VICINITY OF THE TOWN.\r\nEXCURSION TO THE SUMMIT OF THE SILLA.\r\nINDICATIONS OF MINES.\r\n\r\nI remained two months at Caracas, where M. Bonpland and I lived in\r\na large house in the most elevated part of the town. From a gallery\r\nwe could survey at once the summit of the Silla, the serrated ridge\r\nof the Galipano, and the charming valley of the Guayra, the rich\r\nculture of which was pleasingly contrasted with the gloomy curtain\r\nof the surrounding mountains. It was in the dry season, and to\r\nimprove the pasturage, the savannahs and the turf covering the\r\nsteepest rocks were set on fire. These vast conflagrations, viewed\r\nfrom a distance, produce the most singular effects of light.\r\nWherever the savannahs, following the undulating slope of the\r\nrocks, have filled up the furrows hollowed out by the waters, the\r\nflame appears in a dark night like currents of lava suspended over\r\nthe valley. The vivid but steady light assumes a reddish tint, when\r\nthe wind, descending from the Silla, accumulates streams of vapour\r\nin the low regions. At other times (and this effect is still more\r\ncurious) these luminous bands, enveloped in thick clouds, appear\r\nonly at intervals where it is clear; and as the clouds ascend,\r\ntheir edges reflect a splendid light. These various phenomena, so\r\ncommon in the tropics, acquire additional interest from the form of\r\nthe mountains, the direction of the slopes, and the height of the\r\nsavannahs covered with alpine grasses. During the day, the wind of\r\nPetare, blowing from the east, drives the smoke towards the town,\r\nand diminishes the transparency of the air.\r\n\r\nIf we had reason to be satisfied with the situation of our house,\r\nwe had still greater cause for satisfaction in the reception we met\r\nwith from all classes of the inhabitants. Though I have had the\r\nadvantage, which few Spaniards have shared with me, of having\r\nsuccessively visited Caracas, the Havannah, Santa Fe de Bogota,\r\nQuito, Lima, and Mexico, and of having been connected in these six\r\ncapitals of Spanish America with men of all ranks, I will not\r\nventure to decide on the various degrees of civilization, which\r\nsociety has attained in the several colonies. It is easier to\r\nindicate the different shades of national improvement, and the\r\npoint towards which intellectual development tends, than to compare\r\nand class things which cannot all be considered under one point of\r\nview. It appeared to me, that a strong tendency to the study of\r\nscience prevailed at Mexico and Santa Fe de Bogota; more taste for\r\nliterature, and whatever can charm an ardent and lively\r\nimagination, at Quito and Lima; more accurate notions of the\r\npolitical relations of countries, and more enlarged views on the\r\nstate of colonies and their mother-countries, at the Havannah and\r\nCaracas. The numerous communications with commercial Europe, with\r\nthe Caribbean Sea (which we have described as a Mediterranean with\r\nmany outlets), have exercised a powerful influence on the progress\r\nof society in the five provinces of Venezuela and in the island of\r\nCuba. In no other part of Spanish America has civilization assumed\r\na more European character. The great number of Indian cultivators\r\nwho inhabit Mexico and the interior of New Grenada, impart a\r\npeculiar, I may almost say, an exotic aspect, on those vast\r\ncountries. Notwithstanding the increase of the black population, we\r\nseem to be nearer to Cadiz and the United States, at Caracas and\r\nthe Havannah, than in any other part of the New World.\r\n\r\nWhen, in the reign of Charles V, social distinctions and their\r\nconsequent rivalries were introduced from the mother-country to the\r\ncolonies, there arose in Cumana and in other commercial towns of\r\nTerra Firma, exaggerated pretensions to nobility on the part of\r\nsome of the most illustrious families of Caracas, distinguished by\r\nthe designation of los Mantuanos. The progress of knowledge, and\r\nthe consequent change in manners, have, however, gradually and\r\npretty generally neutralized whatever is offensive in those\r\ndistinctions among the whites. In all the Spanish colonies there\r\nexist two kinds of nobility. One is composed of creoles, whose\r\nancestors only from a very recent period filled great stations in\r\nAmerica. Their prerogatives are partly founded on the distinction\r\nthey enjoy in the mother-country; and they imagine they can retain\r\nthose distinctions beyond the sea, whatever may be the date of\r\ntheir settlement in the colonies. The other class of nobility has\r\nmore of an American character. It is composed of the descendants of\r\nthe Conquistadores, that is to say, of the Spaniards who served in\r\nthe army at the time of the first conquest. Among the warriors who\r\nfought with Cortez, Losada, and Pizarro, several belonged to the\r\nmost distinguished families of the Peninsula; others, sprung from\r\nthe inferior classes of the people, have shed lustre on their\r\nnames, by that chivalrous spirit which prevailed at the beginning\r\nof the sixteenth century. In the records of those times of\r\nreligious and military enthusiasm, we find, among the followers of\r\nthe great captains, many simple, virtuous, and generous characters,\r\nwho reprobated the cruelties which then stained the glory of the\r\nSpanish name, but who, being confounded in the mass, have not\r\nescaped the general proscription. The name of Conquistadares\r\nremains the more odious, as the greater number of them, after\r\nhaving outraged peaceful nations, and lived in opulence, did not\r\nend their career by suffering those misfortunes which appease the\r\nindignation of mankind, and sometimes soothe the severity of the\r\nhistorian.\r\n\r\nBut it is not only the progress of ideas, and the conflict between\r\ntwo classes of different origin, which have induced the privileged\r\ncastes to abandon their pretensions, or at least cautiously to\r\nconceal them. Aristocracy in the Spanish colonies has a\r\ncounterpoise of another kind, the action of which becomes every day\r\nmore powerful. A sentiment of equality, among the whites, has\r\npenetrated every bosom. Wherever men of colour are either\r\nconsidered as slaves or as having been enfranchised, that which\r\nconstitutes nobility is hereditary liberty--the proud boast of\r\nhaving never reckoned among ancestors any but freemen. In the\r\ncolonies, the colour of the skin is the real badge of nobility. In\r\nMexico, as well as Peru, at Caracas as in the island of Cuba, a\r\nbare-footed fellow with a white skin, is often heard to exclaim:\r\n\"Does that rich man think himself whiter than I am?\" The population\r\nwhich Europe pours into America being very considerable, it may\r\neasily be supposed, that the axiom, 'every white man is noble'\r\n(todo blanco es caballero), must singularly wound the pretensions\r\nof many ancient and illustrious European families. But it may be\r\nfurther observed, that the truth of this axiom has long since been\r\nacknowledged in Spain, among a people justly celebrated for\r\nprobity, industry, and national spirit. Every Biscayan calls\r\nhimself noble; and there being a greater number of Biscayans in\r\nAmerica and the Philippine Islands, than in the Peninsula, the\r\nwhites of that race have contributed, in no small degree, to\r\npropagate in the colonies the system of equality among all men\r\nwhose blood has not been mixed with that of the African race.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the countries of which the inhabitants, even without a\r\nrepresentative government, or any institution of peerage, annex so\r\nmuch importance to genealogy and the advantages of birth, are not\r\nalways those in which family aristocracy is most offensive. We do\r\nnot find among the natives of Spanish origin, that cold and\r\nassuming air which the character of modern civilization seems to\r\nhave rendered less common in Spain than in the rest of Europe.\r\nConviviality, candour, and great simplicity of manner, unite the\r\ndifferent classes of society in the colonies, as well as in the\r\nmother-country. It may even be said, that the expression of vanity\r\nand self-love becomes less offensive, when it retains something of\r\nsimplicity and frankness.\r\n\r\nI found in several families at Caracas a love of information, an\r\nacquaintance with the masterpieces of French and Italian\r\nliterature, and a marked predilection for music, which is greatly\r\ncultivated, and which (as always results from a taste for the fine\r\narts) brings the different classes of society nearer to each other.\r\nThe mathematical sciences, drawing, and painting, cannot here boast\r\nof any of those establishments with which royal munificence and the\r\npatriotic zeal of the inhabitants have enriched Mexico. In the\r\nmidst of the marvels of nature, so rich in interesting productions,\r\nit is strange that we found no person on this coast devoted to the\r\nstudy of plants and minerals. In a Franciscan convent I met, it is\r\ntrue, with an old monk who drew up the almanac for all the\r\nprovinces of Venezuela, and who possessed some accurate knowledge\r\nof astronomy. Our instruments interested him deeply, and one day\r\nour house was filled with all the monks of San Francisco, begging\r\nto see a dipping-needle. The curiosity excited by physical\r\nphenomena is naturally great in countries undermined by volcanic\r\nfires, and in a climate where nature is at once so majestic and so\r\nmysteriously convulsed.\r\n\r\nWhen we remember, that in the United States of North America,\r\nnewspapers are published in small towns not containing more than\r\nthree thousand inhabitants, it seems surprising that Caracas, with\r\na population of forty or fifty thousand souls, should have\r\npossessed no printing office before 1806; for we cannot give the\r\nname of a printing establishment to a few presses which served only\r\nfrom year to year to promulgate an almanac of a few pages, or the\r\npastoral letter of a bishop. Though the number of those who feel\r\nreading to be a necessity is not very considerable, even in the\r\nSpanish colonies most advanced in civilization, yet it would be\r\nunjust to reproach the colonists for a state of intellectual\r\nlassitude which has been the result of a jealous policy. A\r\nFrenchman, named Delpeche, has the merit of having established the\r\nfirst printing office in Caracas. It appears somewhat extraordinary\r\nthat an establishment of this kind should have followed, and not\r\npreceded, a political revolution.\r\n\r\nIn a country abounding in such magnificent scenery, and at a period\r\nwhen, notwithstanding some symptoms of popular commotion, most of\r\nthe inhabitants seem only to direct attention to physical objects,\r\nsuch as the fertility of the year, the long drought, or the\r\nconflicting winds of Petare and Catia, I expected to find many\r\nindividuals well acquainted with the lofty surrounding mountains.\r\nBut I was disappointed; and we could not find in Caracas a single\r\nperson who had visited the summit of the Silla. Hunters do not\r\nascend so high on the ridges of mountains; and in these countries\r\njourneys are not undertaken for such purposes as gathering alpine\r\nplants, carrying a barometer to an elevated point, or examining the\r\nnature of rocks. Accustomed to a uniform and domestic life, the\r\npeople dread fatigue and sudden changes of climate. They seem to\r\nlive not to enjoy life, but only to prolong it.\r\n\r\nOur walks led us often in the direction of two coffee plantations,\r\nthe proprietors of which, Don Andres de Ibarra and M. Blandin, were\r\nmen of agreeable manners. These plantations were situated opposite\r\nthe Silla de Caracas. Surveying, by a telescope, the steep\r\ndeclivity of the mountains, and the form of the two peaks by which\r\nit is terminated, we could form an idea of the difficulties we\r\nshould have to encounter in reaching its summit. Angles of\r\nelevation, taken with the sextant at our house, had led me to\r\nbelieve that the summit was not so high above sea-level as the\r\ngreat square of Quito. This estimate was far from corresponding\r\nwith the notions entertained by the inhabitants of the city.\r\nMountains which command great towns, have acquired, from that very\r\ncircumstance, an extraordinary celebrity in both continents. Long\r\nbefore they have been accurately measured, a conventional height is\r\nassigned to them; and to entertain the least doubt respecting that\r\nheight is to wound a national prejudice.\r\n\r\nThe captain-general, Senor de Guevara, directed the teniente of\r\nChacao to furnish us with guides to conduct us on our ascent of the\r\nSilla. These guides were negroes, and they knew something of the\r\npath leading over the ridge of the mountain, near the western peak\r\nof the Silla. This path is frequented by smugglers, but neither the\r\nguides, nor the most experienced of the militia, accustomed to\r\npursue the smugglers in these wild spots, had been on the eastern\r\npeak, forming the most elevated summit of the Silla. During the\r\nwhole month of December, the mountain (of which the angles of\r\nelevation made me acquainted with the effects of the terrestrial\r\nrefractions) had appeared only five times free of clouds. In this\r\nseason two serene days seldom succeed each other, and we were\r\ntherefore advised not to choose a clear day for our excursion, but\r\nrather a time when, the clouds not being elevated, we might hope,\r\nafter having crossed the first layer of vapours uniformly spread,\r\nto enter into a dry and transparent air. We passed the night of the\r\n2nd of January in the Estancia de Gallegos, a plantation of\r\ncoffee-trees, near which the little river of Chacaito, flowing in a\r\nluxuriantly shaded ravine, forms some fine cascades in descending\r\nthe mountains. The night was pretty clear; and though on the day\r\npreceding a fatiguing journey it might have been well to have\r\nenjoyed some repose, M. Bonpland and I passed the whole night in\r\nwatching three occultations of the satellites of Jupiter. I had\r\npreviously determined the instant of the observation, but we missed\r\nthem all, owing to some error of calculation in the Connaissance\r\ndes Temps. The apparent time had been mistaken for mean time.\r\n\r\nI was much disappointed by this accident; and after having observed\r\nat the foot of the mountain the intensity of the magnetic forces,\r\nbefore sunrise, we set out at five in the morning, accompanied by\r\nslaves carrying our instruments. Our party consisted of eighteen\r\npersons, and we all walked one behind another, in a narrow path,\r\ntraced on a steep acclivity, covered with turf. We endeavoured\r\nfirst to reach a hill, which towards the south-east seems to form a\r\npromontory of the Silla. It is connected with the body of the\r\nmountain by a narrow dyke, called by the shepherds the Gate, or\r\nPuerta de la Silla. We reached this dyke about seven. The morning\r\nwas fine and cool, and the sky till then seemed to favour our\r\nexcursion. I saw that the thermometer kept a little below 14\r\ndegrees (11.2 degrees Reaum.). The barometer showed that we were\r\nalready six hundred and eighty-five toises above the level of the\r\nsea, that is, nearly eighty toises higher than at the Venta, where\r\nwe enjoyed so magnificent a view of the coast. Our guides thought\r\nthat it would require six hours more to reach the summit of the\r\nSilla.\r\n\r\nWe crossed a narrow dyke of rocks covered with turf; which led us\r\nfrom the promontory of the Puerta to the ridge of the great\r\nmountain. Here the eye looks down on two valleys, or rather narrow\r\ndefiles, filled with thick vegetation. On the right is perceived\r\nthe ravine which descends between the two peaks to the farm of\r\nMunoz; on the left we see the defile of Chacaito, with its waters\r\nflowing out near the farm of Gallegos. The roaring of the cascades\r\nis heard, while the water is unseen, being concealed by thick\r\ngroves of erythrina, clusia, and the Indian fig-tree.* (* Ficus\r\nnymphaeifolia, Erythrina mitis. Two fine species of mimosa are\r\nfound in the same valley; Inga fastuosa, and I. cinerea.) Nothing\r\ncan be more picturesque, in a climate where so many plants have\r\nbroad, large, shining, and coriaceous leaves, than the aspect of\r\ntrees when the spectator looks down from a great height above them,\r\nand when they are illumined by the almost perpendicular rays of the\r\nsun.\r\n\r\nFrom the Puerta de la Silla the steepness of the ascent increases,\r\nand we were obliged to incline our bodies considerably forwards as\r\nwe advanced. The slope is often from 30 to 32 degrees.* (* Since my\r\nexperiments on slopes, mentioned above in Chapter 1.2, I have\r\ndiscovered in the Figure de la Terre of Bouguer, a passage, which\r\nshows that this astronomer, whose opinions are of such weight,\r\nconsidered also 36 degrees as the inclination of a slope quite\r\ninaccessible, if the nature of the ground did not admit of forming\r\nsteps with the foot.) We felt the want of cramp-irons, or sticks\r\nshod with iron. Short grass covered the rocks of gneiss, and it was\r\nequally impossible to hold by the grass, or to form steps as we\r\nmight have done in softer ground. This ascent, which was attended\r\nwith more fatigue than danger, discouraged those who accompanied us\r\nfrom the town, and who were unaccustomed to climb mountains. We\r\nlost a great deal of time in waiting for them, and we did not\r\nresolve to proceed alone till we saw them descending the mountain\r\ninstead of climbing up it. The weather was becoming cloudy; the\r\nmist already issued in the form of smoke, and in slender and\r\nperpendicular streaks, from a small humid wood which bordered the\r\nregion of alpine savannahs above us. It seemed as if a fire had\r\nburst forth at once on several points of the forest. These streaks\r\nof vapour gradually accumulated together, and rising above the\r\nground, were carried along by the morning breeze, and glided like a\r\nlight cloud over the rounded summit of the mountain.\r\n\r\nM. Bonpland and I foresaw from these infallible signs, that we\r\nshould soon be covered by a thick fog; and lest our guides should\r\ntake advantage of this circumstance and leave us, we obliged those\r\nwho carried the most necessary instruments to precede us. We\r\ncontinued climbing the slopes which lead towards the ravine of\r\nChacaito. The familiar loquacity of the Creole blacks formed a\r\nstriking contrast with the taciturn gravity of the Indians, who had\r\nconstantly accompanied us in the missions of Caripe. The negroes\r\namused themselves by laughing at the persons who had been in such\r\nhaste to abandon an expedition so long in preparation; above all,\r\nthey did not spare a young Capuchin monk, a professor of\r\nmathematics, who never ceased to boast of the superior physical\r\nstrength and courage possessed by all classes of European Spaniards\r\nover those born in Spanish America. He had provided himself with\r\nlong slips of white paper, which were to be cut, and flung on the\r\nsavannah, to indicate to those who might stray behind, the\r\ndirection they ought to follow. The professor had even promised the\r\nfriars of his order to fire off some rockets, to announce to the\r\nwhole town of Caracas that we had succeeded in an enterprise which\r\nto him appeared of the utmost importance. He had forgotten that his\r\nlong and heavy garments would embarrass him in the ascent. Having\r\nlost courage long before the creoles, he passed the rest of the day\r\nin a neighbouring plantation, gazing at us through a glass directed\r\nto the Silla, as we climbed the mountain. Unfortunately for us, he\r\nhad taken charge of the water and the provision so necessary in an\r\nexcursion to the mountains. The slaves, who were to rejoin us, were\r\nso long detained by him, that they arrived very late, and we were\r\nten hours without either bread or water.\r\n\r\nThe eastern peak is the most elevated of the two which form the\r\nsummit of the mountain, and to this we directed our course with our\r\ninstruments. The hollow between these two peaks has suggested the\r\nSpanish name of Silla (saddle), which is given to the whole\r\nmountain. The narrow defile which we have already mentioned,\r\ndescends from this hollow toward the valley of Caracas, commencing\r\nnear the western dome. The eastern summit is accessible only by\r\ngoing first to the west of the ravine over the promontory of the\r\nPuerta, proceeding straight forward to the lower summit; and not\r\nturning to the east till the ridge, or the hollow of the Silla\r\nbetween the two peaks, is nearly reached. The general aspect of the\r\nmountain points out this path; the rocks being so steep on the east\r\nof the ravine that it would be extremely difficult to reach the\r\nsummit of the Silla by ascending straight to the eastern dome,\r\ninstead of going by the way of the Puerta.\r\n\r\nFrom the foot of the cascade of Chacaito to one thousand toises of\r\nelevation, we found only savannahs. Two small liliaceous plants,\r\nwith yellow flowers,* alone lift up their heads, among the grasses\r\nwhich cover the rocks. (* Cypura martinicensis, and Sisyrinchium\r\niridifolium. This last is found also near the Venta of La Guayra,\r\nat 600 toises of elevation.) A few brambles* (* Rubus jamaicensis.)\r\nremind us of the form of our European vegetation. We in vain hoped\r\nto find on the mountains of Caracas, and subsequently on the back\r\nof the Andes, an eglantine near these brambles. We did not find one\r\nindigenous rose-tree in all South America, notwithstanding the\r\nanalogy existing between the climates of the high mountains of the\r\ntorrid zone and the climate of our temperate zone. It appears that\r\nthis charming shrub is wanting in all the southern hemisphere,\r\nwithin and beyond the tropics. It was only on the Mexican mountains\r\nthat we were fortunate enough to discover, in the nineteenth degree\r\nof latitude, American eglantines.* (* M. Redoute, in his superb\r\nwork on rose-trees, has given our Mexican eglantine, under the name\r\nof Rosier de Montezuma, Montezuma rose.)\r\n\r\nWe were sometimes so enveloped in mist, that we could not, without\r\ndifficulty, find our way. At this height there is no path, and we\r\nwere obliged to climb with our hands, when our feet failed us, on\r\nthe steep and slippery acclivity. A vein filled with porcelain-clay\r\nattracted our attention.* (* The breadth of the vein is three feet.\r\nThis porcelain-clay, when moistened, readily absorbs oxygen from\r\nthe atmosphere. I found, at Caracas, the residual nitrogen very\r\nslightly mingled with carbonic acid, though the experiment was made\r\nin phials with ground-glass stoppers, not filled with water.) It is\r\nof snowy whiteness, and is no doubt the remains of a decomposed\r\nfeldspar. I forwarded a considerable portion of it to the intendant\r\nof the province. In a country where fuel is not scarce, a mixture\r\nof refractory earths may be useful, to improve the earthenware, and\r\neven the bricks. Every time that the clouds surrounded us, the\r\nthermometer sunk as low as 12 degrees (to 9.6 degrees R.); with a\r\nserene sky it rose to 21 degrees. These observations were made in\r\nthe shade. But it is difficult, on such rapid declivities, covered\r\nwith a dry, shining, yellow turf, to avoid the effects of radiant\r\nheat. We were at nine hundred and forty toises of elevation; and\r\nyet at the same height, towards the east, we perceived in a ravine,\r\nnot merely a few solitary palm-trees, but a whole grove. It was the\r\npalma real; probably a species of the genus Oreodoxa. This group of\r\npalms, at so considerable an elevation, formed a striking contrast\r\nwith the willows* scattered on the depth of the more temperate\r\nvalley of Caracas. (* Salix Humboldtiana of Willdenouw. On the\r\nalpine palm-trees, see my Prolegomena de Dist. Plant. page 235.) We\r\nhere discovered plants of European forms, situated below those of\r\nthe torrid zone.\r\n\r\nAfter proceeding for the space of four hours across the savannahs,\r\nwe entered into a little wood composed of shrubs and small trees,\r\ncalled el Pejual; doubtless from the great abundance here of the\r\npejoa (Gaultheria odorata), a plant with very odoriferous leaves.*\r\n(* It is a great advantage of the Spanish language, and a\r\npeculiarity which it shares in common with the Latin, that, from\r\nthe name of a tree, may be derived a word designating an\r\nassociation or group of trees of the same species. Thus are formed\r\nthe words olivar, robledar, and pinal, from olivo, roble, and pino.\r\nThe Hispano-Americans have added tunal, pejual, guayaval, etc.,\r\nplaces where a great many Cactuses, Gualtheria odoratas, and\r\nPsidiums, grow together.) The steepness of the mountain became less\r\nconsiderable, and we felt an indescribable pleasure in examining\r\nthe plants of this region. Nowhere, perhaps, can be found collected\r\ntogether, in so small a space, productions so beautiful, and so\r\nremarkable in regard to the geography of plants. At the height of a\r\nthousand toises, the lofty savannahs of the hills terminate in a\r\nzone of shrubs which, by their appearance, their tortuous branches,\r\ntheir stiff leaves, and the magnitude and beauty of their purple\r\nflowers, remind us of what is called, in the Cordilleras of the\r\nAndes, the vegetation of the paramos and the punas.* (* For the\r\nexplanation of these words, see above Chapter 1.5.) We there find\r\nthe family of the alpine rhododendrons, the thibaudias, the\r\nandromedas, the vacciniums, and those befarias with resinous\r\nleaves, which we have several times compared to the rhododendron of\r\nour European Alps.\r\n\r\nEven when nature does not produce the same species in analogous\r\nclimates, either in the plains of isothermal parallels,* (We may\r\ncompare together either latitudes which in the same hemisphere\r\npresent the same mean temperature (as, for instance, Pennsylvania\r\nand the central part of France, Chile and the southern part of New\r\nHolland); or we may consider the relations that may exist between\r\nthe vegetation of the two hemispheres under isothermal parallels.)\r\nor on table-lands, the temperature of which resembles that of\r\nplaces nearer the poles,* we still remark a striking resemblance of\r\nappearance and physiognomy in the vegetation of the most distant\r\ncountries. (* The geography of plants comprises not merely an\r\nexamination of the analogies observed in the same hemisphere; as\r\nbetween the vegetation of the Pyrenees and that of the Scandinavian\r\nplains; or between that of the Cordilleras of Peru and of the\r\ncoasts of Chile. It also investigates the relations between the\r\nalpine plants of both hemispheres. It compares the vegetation of\r\nthe Alleghanies and the Cordilleras of Mexico, with that of the\r\nmountains of Chile and Brazil. Bearing in mind that every\r\nisothermal line has an alpine branch (as, for instance, that which\r\nconnects Upsala with a point in the Swiss Alps), the great problem\r\nof the analogy of vegetable forms may be defined as follows: 1st,\r\nexamining in each hemisphere, and at the level of the coasts, the\r\nvegetation on the same isothermal line, especially near convex or\r\nconcave summits; 2nd, comparing, with respect to the form of\r\nplants, on the same isothermal line north and south of the equator,\r\nthe alpine branch with that traced in the plains; 3rd, comparing\r\nthe vegetation on homonymous isothermal lines in the two\r\nhemispheres, either in the low regions, or in the alpine regions.)\r\nThis phenomenon is one of the most curious in the history of\r\norganic forms. I say the history; for in vain would reason forbid\r\nman to form hypotheses on the origin of things; he still goes on\r\npuzzling himself with insoluble problems relating to the\r\ndistribution of beings.\r\n\r\nA gramen of Switzerland grows on the granitic rocks of the straits\r\nof Magellan.* (* Phleum alpinum, examined by Mr. Brown. The\r\ninvestigations of this great botanist prove that a certain number\r\nof plants are at once common to both hemispheres. Potentilla\r\nanserina, Prunella vulgaris, Scirpus mucronatus, and Panicum\r\ncrus-galli, grow in Germany, in Australia, and in Pennsylvania.)\r\nNew Holland contains above forty European phanerogamous plants: and\r\nthe greater number of those plants, which are found equally in the\r\ntemperate zones of both hemispheres, are entirely wanting in the\r\nintermediary or equinoctial region, as well in the plains as on the\r\nmountains. A downy-leaved violet, which terminates in some sort the\r\nzone of the phanerogamous plants at Teneriffe, and which was long\r\nthought peculiar to that island,* is seen three hundred leagues\r\nfarther north, near the snowy summit of the Pyrenees. (* The Viola\r\ncheiranthifolia has been found by MM. Kunth and Von Buch among the\r\nalpine plants which Jussieu brought from the Pyrenees.) Gramina and\r\ncyperaceous plants of Germany, Arabia, and Senegal, have been\r\nrecognized among those that were gathered by M. Bonpland and myself\r\non the cold table-lands of Mexico, along the burning shores of the\r\nOrinoco, and in the southern hemisphere on the Andes and Quito.* (*\r\nCyperus mucronatus, Poa eragrostis, Festuca myurus, Andropogos\r\navenaceus, Lapago racemosa. (See the Nova Genera et Species\r\nPlantarum volume 1 page 25.)) How can we conceive the migration of\r\nplants through regions now covered by the ocean? How have the germs\r\nof organic life, which resemble each other in their appearance, and\r\neven in their internal structure, unfolded themselves at unequal\r\ndistances from the poles and from the surface of the seas, wherever\r\nplaces so distant present any analogy of temperature?\r\nNotwithstanding the influence exercised on the vital functions of\r\nplants by the pressure of the air, and the greater or less\r\nextinction of light, heat, unequally distributed in different\r\nseasons of the year, must doubtless be considered as the most\r\npowerful stimulus of vegetation.\r\n\r\nThe number of identical species in the two continents and in the\r\ntwo hemispheres is far less than the statements of early travellers\r\nwould lead us to believe. The lofty mountains of equinoctial\r\nAmerica have certainly plantains, valerians, arenarias,\r\nranunculuses, medlars, oaks, and pines, which from their\r\nphysiognomy we might confound with those of Europe; but they are\r\nall specifically different. When nature does not present the same\r\nspecies, she loves to repeat the same genera. Neighbouring species\r\nare often placed at enormous distances from each other, in the low\r\nregions of the temperate zone, and on the alpine heights of the\r\nequator. At other times (and the Silla of Caracas affords a\r\nstriking example of this phenomenon), they are not the European\r\ngenera, which have sent species to people like colonists the\r\nmountains of the torrid zone, but genera of the same tribe,\r\ndifficult to be distinguished by their appearance, which take the\r\nplace of each other in different latitudes.\r\n\r\nThe mountains of New Grenada surrounding the table-lands of Bogota\r\nare more than two hundred leagues distant from those of Caracas,\r\nand yet the Silla, the only elevated peak in the chain of low\r\nmountains, presents those singular groupings of befarias with\r\npurple flowers, of andromedas, of gualtherias, of myrtilli, of uvas\r\ncamaronas,* (* The names vine-tree, and uvas camaronas, are given\r\nin the Andes to plants of the genus Thibaudia, on account of their\r\nlarge succulent fruits. Thus the ancient botanists gave the name of\r\nbear's vine, uva ursi, and vine of Mount Ida (Vitis idaea), to an\r\narbutus and a myrtillus, which belong, like the thibaudia, to the\r\nfamily of the Ericineae.) of nerteras, and of aralias with hoary\r\nleaves,* (* Nertera depressa, Aralia reticulata, Hedyotis\r\nblaerioides.) which characterize the vegetation of the paramos on\r\nthe high Cordilleras of Santa Fe. We found the same Thibaudia\r\nglandulosa at the entrance of the table-land of Bogota, and in the\r\nPejual of the Silla. The coast-chain of Caracas is unquestionably\r\nconnected (by the Torito, the Palomera, Tocuyo, and the paramos of\r\nRosas, of Bocono, and of Niquitao) with the high Cordilleras of\r\nMerida, Pamplona, and Santa Fe; but from the Silla to Tocuyo, along\r\na distance of seventy leagues, the mountains of Caracas are so low,\r\nthat the shrubs of the family of the ericineous plants, just cited,\r\ndo not find the cold climate which is necessary for their\r\ndevelopment. Supposing, as is probable, that the thibaudias and the\r\nrhododendron of the Andes, or befaria, exist in the paramo of\r\nNiquitao and in the Sierra de Merida, covered with eternal snow,\r\nthese plants would nevertheless want a ridge sufficiently lofty and\r\nlong for their migration towards the Silla of Caracas.\r\n\r\nThe more we study the distribution of organized beings on the\r\nglobe, the more we are inclined, if not to abandon the ideas of\r\nmigration, at least to consider them as hypotheses not entirely\r\nsatisfactory. The chain of the Andes divides the whole of South\r\nAmerica into two unequal longitudinal parts. At the foot of this\r\nchain, on the east and west, we found a great number of plants\r\nspecifically the same. The various passages of the Cordilleras\r\nnowhere permit the vegetable productions of the warm regions to\r\nproceed from the coasts of the Pacific to the banks of the Amazon.\r\nWhen a peak attains a great elevation, either in the middle of very\r\nlow mountains and plains, or in the centre of an archipelago heaved\r\nup by volcanic fires, its summit is covered with alpine plants,\r\nmany of which are again found, at immense distances, on other\r\nmountains having an analogous climate. Such are the general\r\nphenomena of the distribution of plants.\r\n\r\nIt is now said that a mountain is high enough to enter into the\r\nlimits of the rhododendrons and the befarias, as it has long been\r\nsaid that such a mountain reached the limit of perpetual snow. In\r\nusing this expression, it is tacitly admitted, that under the\r\ninfluence of certain temperatures, certain vegetable forms must\r\nnecessarily be developed. Such a supposition, however, taken in all\r\nits generality, is not strictly accurate. The pines of Mexico are\r\nwanting on the Cordilleras of Peru. The Silla of Caracas is not\r\ncovered with the oaks which flourish in New Grenada at the same\r\nheight. Identity of forms indicates an analogy of climate; but in\r\nsimilar climates the species may be singularly diversified.\r\n\r\nThe charming rhododendron of the Andes (the befaria) was first\r\ndescribed by M. Mutis, who observed it near Pamplona and Santa Fe\r\nde Bogota, in the fourth and seventh degree of north latitude. It\r\nwas so little known before our expedition to the Silla, that it was\r\nscarcely to be found in any herbal in Europe. The learned editors\r\nof the Flora of Peru had even described it under another name, that\r\nof acunna. In the same manner as the rhododendrons of Lapland,\r\nCaucasus, and the Alps* (* Rhododendron lapponicum, R. caucasicum,\r\nR. ferrugineum, and R. hirsutum.) differ from each other, the two\r\nspecies of befaria we brought from the Silla* (* Befaria glauca, B.\r\nledifolia.) are also specifically different from that of Santa Fe\r\nand Bogota.* (* Befaria aestuans, and B. resinosa.) Near the\r\nequator the rhododendrons of the Andes (Particularly B. aestuans of\r\nMutis, and two new species of the southern hemisphere, which we\r\nhave described under the name of B. coarctata, and B. grandiflora.)\r\ncover the mountains as far as the highest paramos, at sixteen and\r\nseventeen hundred toises of elevation. Advancing northward, on the\r\nSilla de Caracas, we find them much lower, a little below one\r\nthousand toises. The befaria recently discovered in Florida, in\r\nlatitude 30 degrees, grows even on hills of small elevation. Thus\r\nin a space of six hundred leagues in latitude, these shrubs descend\r\ntowards the plains in proportion as their distance from the equator\r\naugments. The rhododendron of Lapland grows also at eight or nine\r\nhundred toises lower than the rhododendron of the Alps and the\r\nPyrenees. We were surprised at not meeting with any species of\r\nbefaria in the mountains of Mexico, between the rhododendrons of\r\nSanta Fe and Caracas, and those of Florida.\r\n\r\nIn the small grove which crowns the Silla, the Befaria ledifolia is\r\nonly three or four feet high. The trunk is divided from its root\r\ninto a great many slender and even verticillate branches. The\r\nleaves are oval, lanceolate, glaucous on their inferior part, and\r\ncurled at the edges. The whole plant is covered with long and\r\nviscous hairs, and emits a very agreeable resinous smell. The bees\r\nvisit its fine purple flowers, which are very abundant, as in all\r\nthe alpine plants, and, when in full blossom, they are often nearly\r\nan inch wide.\r\n\r\nThe rhododendron of Switzerland, in those places where it grows, at\r\nthe elevation of between eight hundred and a thousand toises,\r\nbelongs to a climate, the mean temperature of which is +2 and-1\r\ndegrees, like that of the plains of Lapland. In this zone the\r\ncoldest months are-4, and-10 degrees: the hottest, 12 and 7\r\ndegrees. Thermometrical observations, made at the same heights and\r\nin the same latitudes, render it probable that, at the Pejual of\r\nthe Silla, one thousand toises above the Caribbean Sea, the mean\r\ntemperature of the air is still 17 or 18 degrees; and that the\r\nthermometer keeps, in the coolest season, between 15 and 20 degrees\r\nin the day, and in the night between 10 and 12 degrees. At the\r\nhospital of St. Gothard, situated nearly on the highest limit of\r\nthe rhododendron of the Alps, the maximum of heat, in the month of\r\nAugust at noon, in the shade, is usually 12 or 13 degrees; in the\r\nnight, at the same season, the air is cooled by the radiation of\r\nthe soil down to +1 or-1.5 degrees. Under the same barometric\r\npressure, consequently at the same height, but thirty degrees of\r\nlatitude nearer the equator, the befaria of the Silla is often, at\r\nnoon, in the sun, exposed to a heat of 23 or 24 degrees. The\r\ngreatest nocturnal refrigeration probably never exceeds 7 degrees.\r\nWe have carefully compared the climate, under the influence of\r\nwhich, at different latitudes, two groups of plants of the same\r\nfamily vegetate at equal heights above the level of the sea. The\r\nresults would have been far different, had we compared zones\r\nequally distant, either from the perpetual snow, or from the\r\nisothermal line of 0 degrees.* (* The stratum of air, the mean\r\ntemperature of which is 0 degrees, and which scarcely coincides\r\nwith the superior limit of perpetual snow, is found in the parallel\r\nof the rhododendrons of Switzerland at nine hundred toises; in the\r\nparallel of the befarias of Caracas, at two thousand seven hundred\r\ntoises of elevation.)\r\n\r\nIn the little thicket of the Pejual, near the purple-flowered\r\nbefaria, grows a heath-leaved hedyotis, eight feet high; the\r\ncaparosa,* which is a large arborescent hypericum (* Vismia\r\ncaparosa (a loranthus clings to this plant, and appropriates to\r\nitself the yellow juice of the vismia); Davallia meifolia, Heracium\r\navilae, Aralia arborea, Jacq., and Lepidium virginicum. Two new\r\nspecies of lycopodium, the thyoides, and the aristatum, are seen\r\nlower down, near the Puerto de la Silla.); a lepidium, which\r\nappears identical with that of Virginia; and lastly, lycopodiaceous\r\nplants and mosses, which cover the rocks and roots of the trees.\r\nThat which gives most celebrity in the country to the little\r\nthicket, is a shrub ten or fifteen feet high, of the corymbiferous\r\nfamily. The Creoles call it incense (incienso).* (* Trixis\r\nnereifolia of M. Bonpland.) Its tough and crenate leaves, as well\r\nas the extremities of the branches, are covered with a white wool.\r\nIt is a new species of Trixis, extremely resinous, the flowers of\r\nwhich have the agreeable odour of storax. This smell is very\r\ndifferent from that emitted by the leaves of the Trixis\r\nterebinthinacea of the mountains of Jamaica, opposite to those of\r\nCaracas. The people sometimes mix the incienso of the Silla with\r\nthe flowers of the pevetera, another composite plant, the smell of\r\nwhich resembles that of the heliotropium of Peru. The pevetera does\r\nnot, however, grow on the mountains so high as the zone of the\r\nbefarias; it vegetates in the valley of Chacao, and the ladies of\r\nCaracas prepare from it an extremely pleasant odoriferous water.\r\n\r\nWe spent a long time in examining the fine resinous and fragrant\r\nplants of the Pejual. The sky became more and more cloudy, and the\r\nthermometer sank below 11 degrees, a temperature at which, in this\r\nzone, people begin to suffer from the cold. Quitting the little\r\nthicket of alpine plants, we found ourselves again in a savannah.\r\nWe climbed over a part of the western dome, in order to descend\r\ninto the hollow of the Silla, a valley which separates the two\r\nsummits of the mountain. We there had great difficulties to\r\novercome, occasioned by the force of the vegetation. A botanist\r\nwould not readily guess that the thick wood covering this valley is\r\nformed by the assemblage of a plant of the musaceous family.*\r\n(*Scitamineous plants, or family of the plantains.) It is probably\r\na maranta, or a heliconia; its leaves are large and shining; it\r\nreaches the height of fourteen or fifteen feet, and its succulent\r\nstalks grow near one another like the stems of the reeds found in\r\nthe humid regions of the south of Europe.* (* Arundo donax.) We\r\nwere obliged to cut our way through this forest. The negroes walked\r\nbefore with their cutlasses or machetes. The people confound this\r\nalpine scitamineous plant with the arborescent gramina, under the\r\nname of carice. We saw neither its fruit nor flowers. We are\r\nsurprised to meet with a monocotyledonous family, believed to be\r\nexclusively found in the hot and low regions of the tropics, at\r\neleven hundred toises of elevation; much higher than the\r\nandromedas, the thibaudias, and the rhododendron of the\r\nCordilleras.* (* Befaria.) In a chain of mountains no less\r\nelevated, and more northern (the Blue Mountains of Jamaica), the\r\nHeliconia of the parrots and the bihai, rather grow in the alpine\r\nshaded situations.* (* Heliconia psittacorum, and H. bihai. These\r\ntwo heliconias are very common in the plains of Terra Firma.)\r\n\r\nWandering in this thick wood of musaceae or arborescent plants, we\r\nconstantly directed our course towards the eastern peak, which we\r\nperceived from time to time through an opening. On a sudden we\r\nfound ourselves enveloped in a thick mist; the compass alone could\r\nguide us; but in advancing northward we were in danger at every\r\nstep of finding ourselves on the brink of that enormous wall of\r\nrocks, which descends almost perpendicularly to the depth of six\r\nthousand feet towards the sea. We were obliged to halt. Surrounded\r\nby clouds sweeping the ground, we began to doubt whether we should\r\nreach the eastern peak before night. Happily, the negroes who\r\ncarried our water and provisions, rejoined us, and we resolved to\r\ntake some refreshment. Our repast did not last long. Possibly the\r\nCapuchin father had not thought of the great number of persons who\r\naccompanied us, or perhaps the slaves had made free with our\r\nprovisions on the way; be that as it may, we found nothing but\r\nolives, and scarcely any bread. Horace, in his retreat at Tibur,\r\nnever boasted of a repast more light and frugal; but olives, which\r\nmight have afforded a satisfactory meal to a poet, devoted to\r\nstudy, and leading a sedentary life, appeared an aliment by no\r\nmeans sufficiently substantial for travellers climbing mountains.\r\nWe had watched the greater part of the night, and we walked for\r\nnine hours without finding a single spring. Our guides were\r\ndiscouraged; they wished to go back, and we had great difficulty in\r\npreventing them.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the mist I made trial of the electrometer of Volta,\r\narmed with a smoking match. Though very near a thick wood of\r\nheliconias, I obtained very sensible signs of atmospheric\r\nelectricity. It often varied from positive to negative, its\r\nintensity changing every instant. These variations, and the\r\nconflict of several small currents of air, which divided the mist,\r\nand transformed it into clouds, the borders of which were visible,\r\nappeared to me infallible prognostics of a change in the weather.\r\nIt was only two o'clock in the afternoon; we entertained some hope\r\nof reaching the eastern summit of the Silla before sunset, and of\r\nre-descending into the valley separating the two peaks, intending\r\nthere to pass the night, to light a great fire, and to make our\r\nnegroes construct a hut with the leaves of the heliconia. We sent\r\noff half of our servants with orders to hasten the next morning to\r\nmeet us, not with olives, but with a supply of salt beef.\r\n\r\nWe had scarcely made these arrangements when the east wind began to\r\nblow violently from the sea. The thermometer rose to 12.5 degrees.\r\nIt was no doubt an ascending wind, which, by heightening the\r\ntemperature, dissolved the vapours. In less than two minutes the\r\nclouds dispersed, and the two domes of the Silla appeared to us\r\nsingularly near. We opened the barometer in the lowest part of the\r\nhollow that separates the two summits, near a little pool of very\r\nmuddy water. Here, as in the West India Islands, marshy plains are\r\nfound at great elevations; not because the woody mountains attract\r\nthe clouds, but because they condense the vapours by the effect of\r\nnocturnal refrigeration, occasioned by the radiation of heat from\r\nthe ground, and from the parenchyma of the leaves. The mercury was\r\nat 21 inches 5.7 lines. We shaped our course direct to the eastern\r\nsummit. The obstruction caused by the vegetation gradually\r\ndiminished; it was, however, necessary to cut down some heliconias;\r\nbut these arborescent plants were not now very thick or high. The\r\npeaks of the Silla themselves, as we have several times mentioned,\r\nare covered only with gramina and small shrubs of befaria. Their\r\nbarrenness, however, is not owing to their height: the limit of\r\ntrees in this region is four hundred toises higher; since, judging\r\naccording to the analogy of other mountains, this limit would be\r\nfound here only at a height of eighteen hundred toises. The absence\r\nof large trees on the two rocky summits of the Silla may be\r\nattributed to the aridity of the soil, the violence of the winds\r\nblowing from the sea, and the conflagrations so frequent in all the\r\nmountains of the equinoctial region.\r\n\r\nTo reach the eastern peak, which is the highest, it is necessary to\r\napproach as near as possible the great precipice which descends\r\ntowards Caravalleda and the coast. The gneiss as far as this spot\r\npreserves its lamellar texture and its primitive direction; but\r\nwhere we climbed the summit of the Silla, we found it had passed\r\ninto granite. Its texture becomes granular; the mica, less\r\nfrequent, is more unequally spread through the rock. Instead of\r\ngarnets we met with a few solitary crystals of hornblende. It is,\r\nhowever, not a syenite, but rather a granite of new formation. We\r\nwere three quarters of an hour in reaching the summit of the\r\npyramid. This part of the way is not dangerous, provided the\r\ntraveller carefully examines the stability of each fragment of rock\r\non which he places his foot. The granite superposed on the gneiss\r\ndoes not present a regular separation into beds: it is divided by\r\nclefts, which often cross one another at right angles. Prismatic\r\nblocks, one foot wide and twelve long, stand out from the ground\r\nobliquely, and appear on the edges of the precipice like enormous\r\nbeams suspended over the abyss.\r\n\r\nHaving arrived at the summit, we enjoyed, for a few minutes only,\r\nthe serenity of the sky. The eye ranged over a vast extent of\r\ncountry: looking down to the north was the sea, and to the south,\r\nthe fertile valley of Caracas. The barometer was at 20 inches 7.6\r\nlines; the thermometer at 13.7 degrees. We were at thirteen hundred\r\nand fifty toises of elevation. We gazed on an extent of sea, the\r\nradius of which was thirty-six leagues. Persons who are affected by\r\nlooking downward from a considerable height should remain at the\r\ncentre of the small flat which crowns the eastern summit of the\r\nSilla. The mountain is not very remarkable for height: it is nearly\r\neighty toises lower than the Canigou; but it is distinguished among\r\nall the mountains I have visited by an enormous precipice on the\r\nside next the sea. The coast forms only a narrow border; and\r\nlooking from the summit of the pyramid on the houses of\r\nCaravalleda, this wall of rocks seems, by an optical illusion, to\r\nbe nearly perpendicular. The real slope of the declivity appeared\r\nto me, according to an exact calculation, 53 degrees 28 minutes.*\r\n(* Observations of the latitude give for the horizontal distance\r\nbetween the foot of the mountain near Caravalleda, and the vertical\r\nline passing through its summit, scarcely 1000 toises.) The mean\r\nslope of the peak of Teneriffe is scarcely 12 degrees 30 minutes. A\r\nprecipice of six or seven thousand feet, like that of the Silla of\r\nCaracas, is a phenomenon far more rare than is generally believed\r\nby those who cross mountains without measuring their height, their\r\nbulk, and their slope. Since the experiments on the fall of bodies,\r\nand on their deviation to the south-east, have been resumed in\r\nseveral parts of Europe, a rock of two hundred and fifty toises of\r\nperpendicular elevation has been in vain sought for among all the\r\nAlps of Switzerland. The declivity of Mont Blanc towards the Allee\r\nBlanche does not even reach an angle of 45 degrees; though in the\r\ngreater number of geological works, Mont Blanc is described as\r\nperpendicular on the south side.\r\n\r\nAt the Silla of Caracas, the enormous northern cliff is partly\r\ncovered with vegetation, notwithstanding the extreme steepness of\r\nits slope. Tufts of befaria and andromedas appear as if suspended\r\nfrom the rock. The little valley which separates the domes towards\r\nthe south, stretches in the direction of the sea. Alpine plants\r\nfill this hollow; and, not confined to the ridge of the mountain,\r\nthey follow the sinuosities of the ravine. It would seem as if\r\ntorrents were concealed under that fresh foliage; and the\r\ndisposition of the plants, the grouping of so many inanimate\r\nobjects, give the landscape all the charm of motion and of life.\r\n\r\nSeven months had now elapsed since we had been on the summit of the\r\npeak of Teneriffe, whence we surveyed a space of the globe equal to\r\na fourth part of France. The apparent horizon of the sea is there\r\nsix leagues farther distant than at the top of the Silla, and yet\r\nwe saw that horizon, at least for some time, very distinctly. It\r\nwas strongly marked, and not confounded with the adjacent strata of\r\nair. At the Silla, which is five hundred and fifty toises lower\r\nthan the peak of Teneriffe, the horizon, though nearer, continued\r\ninvisible towards the north and north-north-east. Following with\r\nthe eye the surface of the sea, which was smooth as glass, we were\r\nstruck with the progressive diminution of the reflected light.\r\nWhere the visual ray touched the last limit of that surface, the\r\nwater was lost among the superposed strata of air. This appearance\r\nhas something in it very extraordinary. We expect to see the\r\nhorizon level with the eye; but, instead of distinguishing at this\r\nheight a marked limit between the two elements, the more distant\r\nstrata of water seem to be transformed into vapour, and mingled\r\nwith the aerial ocean. I observed the same appearance, not in one\r\nspot of the horizon alone, but on an extent of more than a hundred\r\nand sixty degrees, along the Pacific, when I found myself for the\r\nfirst time on the pointed rock that commands the crater of\r\nPichincha; a volcano, the elevation of which exceeds that of Mont\r\nBlanc.* (* See Views of Nature, Bohn's edition, page 358.) The\r\nvisibility of a very distant horizon depends, when there is no\r\nmirage, upon two distinct things: the quantity of light received on\r\nthat part of the sea where the visual ray terminates; and the\r\nextinction of the reflected light during its passage through the\r\nintermediate strata of air. It may happen, notwithstanding the\r\nserenity of the sky and the transparency of the atmosphere, that\r\nthe ocean is feebly illuminated at thirty or forty leagues'\r\ndistance; or that the strata of air nearest the earth may\r\nextinguish a great deal of the light, by absorbing the rays that\r\ntraverse them.\r\n\r\nThe rounded peak, or western dome of the Silla, concealed from us\r\nthe view of the town of Caracas; but we distinguished the nearest\r\nhouses, the villages of Chacao and Petare, the coffee plantations,\r\nand the course of the Rio Guayra, a slender streak of water\r\nreflecting a silvery light. The narrow band of cultivated ground\r\nwas pleasingly contrasted with the wild and gloomy aspect of the\r\nneighbouring mountains. Whilst contemplating these grand scenes, we\r\nfeel little regret that the solitudes of the New World are not\r\nembellished with the monuments of antiquity.\r\n\r\nBut we could not long avail ourselves of the advantage arising from\r\nthe position of the Silla, in commanding all the neighbouring\r\nsummits. While we were examining with our glasses that part of the\r\nsea, the horizon of which was clearly defined, and the chain of the\r\nmountains of Ocumare, behind which begins the unknown world of the\r\nOrinoco and the Amazon, a thick fog from the plains rose to the\r\nelevated regions, first filling the bottom of the valley of\r\nCaracas. The vapours, illumined from above, presented a uniform\r\ntint of a milky white. The valley seemed overspread with water, and\r\nlooked like an arm of the sea, of which the adjacent mountains\r\nformed the steep shore. In vain we waited for the slave who carried\r\nRamsden's great sextant. Eager to avail myself of the favourable\r\nstate of the sky, I resolved to take a few solar altitudes with a\r\nsextant by Troughton of two inches radius. The disk of the sun was\r\nhalf-concealed by the mist. The difference of longitude between the\r\nquarter of the Trinidad and the eastern peak of the Silla appears\r\nscarcely to exceed 0 degrees 3 minutes 22 seconds.* (* The difference\r\nof longitude between the Silla and La Guayra, according to Fidalgo,\r\nis 0 degrees 6 minutes 40 seconds.)\r\n\r\nWhilst, seated on the rock, I was determining the dip of the\r\nneedle, I found my hands covered with a species of hairy bee, a\r\nlittle smaller than the honey-bee of the north of Europe. These\r\ninsects make their nests in the ground. They seldom fly; and, from\r\nthe slowness of their movements, I should have supposed they were\r\nbenumbed by the cold of the mountains. The people, in these\r\nregions, call them angelitos (little angels), because they very\r\nseldom sting. They are no doubt of the genus Apis, of the division\r\nmelipones. It has been erroneously affirmed that these bees, which\r\nare peculiar to the New World, are destitute of all offensive\r\nweapons. Their sting is indeed comparatively feeble, and they use\r\nit seldom; but a person, not fully convinced of the harmlessness of\r\nthese angelitos, can scarcely divest himself of a sensation of\r\nfear. I must confess, that, whilst engaged in my astronomical\r\nobservations, I was often on the point of letting my instruments\r\nfall, when I felt my hands and face covered with these hairy bees.\r\nOur guides assured us that they attempt to defend themselves only\r\nwhen irritated by being seized by their legs. I was not tempted to\r\ntry the experiment on myself.\r\n\r\nThe dip of the needle at the Silla was one centesimal degree less\r\nthan in the town of Caracas. In collecting the observations which I\r\nmade during calm weather and in very favourable circumstances, on\r\nthe mountains as well as along the coast, it would at first seem,\r\nthat we discover, in that part of the globe, a certain influence of\r\nthe heights on the dip of the needle, and the intensity of the\r\nmagnetical forces; but we must remark, that the dip at Caracas is\r\nmuch greater than could be supposed, from the situation of the\r\ntown, and that the magnetical phenomena are modified by the\r\nproximity of certain rocks, which constitute so many particular\r\ncentres or little systems of attraction.* (* I have seen fragments\r\nof quartz traversed by parallel bands of magnetic iron, carried\r\ninto the valley of Caracas by the waters descending from the\r\nGalipano and the Cerro de Avila. This banded magnetic iron-ore is\r\nfound also in the Sierra Nevada of Merida. Between the two peaks of\r\nthe Silla, angular fragments of cellular quartz are found, covered\r\nwith red oxide of iron. They do not act on the needle. This oxide\r\nis of a cinnabar-red colour.)\r\n\r\nThe temperature of the atmosphere varied on the summit of the Silla\r\nfrom eleven to fourteen degrees, according as the weather was calm\r\nor windy. Every one knows how difficult it is to verify, on the\r\nsummit of a mountain, the temperature, which is to serve for the\r\nbarometric calculation. The wind was east, which would seem to\r\nprove that the trade-winds extend in this latitude much higher than\r\nfifteen hundred toises. Von Buch had observed that, at the peak of\r\nTeneriffe, near the northern limit of the trade-winds, there exists\r\ngenerally at the elevation of one thousand nine hundred toises, a\r\ncontrary current from the west. The Academy of Sciences recommended\r\nthe men of science who accompanied the unfortunate La Perouse, to\r\nemploy small air-balloons for the purpose of ascertaining at sea\r\nthe extent of the trade-winds within the tropics. Such experiments\r\nare very difficult. Small balloons do not in general reach the\r\nheight of the Silla; and the light clouds which are sometimes\r\nperceived at an elevation of three or four thousand toises, for\r\ninstance, the fleecy clouds, called by the French moutons, remain\r\nalmost fixed, or have such a slow motion, that it is impossible to\r\njudge of the direction of the wind.\r\n\r\nDuring the short space of time that the sky was serene at the\r\nzenith, I found the blue of the atmosphere sensibly deeper than on\r\nthe coasts. It is probable that, in the months of July and August,\r\nthe difference between the colour of the sky on the coasts and on\r\nthe summit of the Silla is still more considerable, but the\r\nmeteorological phenomenon with which M. Bonpland and myself were\r\nmost struck during the hour we passed on the mountain, was the\r\napparent dryness of the air, which seemed to increase as the fog\r\naugmented.\r\n\r\nThis fog soon became so dense that it would have been imprudent to\r\nremain longer on the edge of a precipice of seven or eight thousand\r\nfeet deep.* (* In the direction of north-west the slopes appear\r\nmore accessible; and I have been told of a path frequented by\r\nsmugglers, which leads to Caravalleda, between the two peaks of the\r\nSilla. From the eastern peak I took the bearings of the western\r\npeak, 64 degrees 40 minutes south-west; and of the houses, which I\r\nwas told belonged to Caravalleda, 55 degrees 20 minutes north-west.\r\n) We descended the eastern dome of the Silla, and gathered in our\r\ndescent a gramen, which not only forms a new and very remarkable\r\ngenus, but which, to our great astonishment, we found again some\r\ntime after on the summit of the volcano of Pichincha, at the\r\ndistance of four hundred leagues from the Silla, in the southern\r\nhemisphere.* (* Aegopogon cenchroides.) The Lichen floridus, so\r\ncommon in the north of Europe, covered the branches of the befaria\r\nand the Gualtheria odorata, descending even to the roots of these\r\nshrubs. Examining the mosses which cover the rocks of gneiss in the\r\nvalley between the two peaks, I was surprised at finding real\r\npebbles,--rounded fragments of quartz.* (* Fragments of brown\r\ncopper-ore were found mixed with these pebbles, at an elevation of\r\n1170 toises.) It may be conceived that the valley of Caracas was\r\nonce an inland lake, before the Rio Guayra found an issue to the\r\neast near Caurimare, at the foot of the hill of Auyamas, and before\r\nthe ravine of Tipe opened on the west, in the direction of Gatia\r\nand Cabo Blanco. But how can we imagine that these waters could\r\nascend as high as the Silla, when the mountains opposite this peak,\r\nthose of Ocumare, were too low to prevent their overflow into the\r\nllanos? The pebbles could not have been brought by torrents from\r\nmore elevated points, since there is no height that commands the\r\nSilla. Must we admit that they have been heaved up, like all the\r\nmountains which border the coast.\r\n\r\nIt was half after four in the afternoon when we finished our\r\nobservations. Satisfied with the success of our journey, we forgot\r\nthat there might be danger in descending in the dark, steep\r\ndeclivities covered by a smooth and slippery turf. The mist\r\nconcealed the valley from us; but we distinguished the double hill\r\nof La Puerta, which, like all objects lying almost perpendicularly\r\nbeneath the eye, appeared extremely near. We relinquished our\r\ndesign of passing the night between the two summits of the Silla,\r\nand having again found the path we had cut through the thick wood\r\nof heliconia, we soon arrived at the Pejual, the region of\r\nodoriferous and resinous plants. The beauty of the befarias, and\r\ntheir branches covered with large purple flowers, again rivetted\r\nour attention. When, in these climates, a botanist gathers plants\r\nto form his herbal, he becomes difficult in his choice in\r\nproportion to the luxuriance of vegetation. He casts away those\r\nwhich have been first cut, because they appear less beautiful than\r\nthose which were out of reach. Though loaded with plants before\r\nquitting the Pejual, we still regretted not having made a more\r\nample harvest. We tarried so long in this spot, that night\r\nsurprised us as we entered the savannah, at the elevation of\r\nupwards of nine hundred toises.\r\n\r\nAs there is scarcely any twilight in the tropics, we pass suddenly\r\nfrom bright daylight to darkness. The moon was on the horizon; but\r\nher disk was veiled from time to time by thick clouds, drifted by a\r\ncold and rough wind. Rapid slopes, covered with yellow and dry\r\ngrass, now seen in shade, and now suddenly illumined, seemed like\r\nprecipices, the depth of which the eye sought in vain to measure.\r\nWe proceeded onwards, in single file, and endeavoured to support\r\nourselves by our hands, lest we should roll down. The guides, who\r\ncarried our instruments, abandoned us successively, to sleep on the\r\nmountain. Among those who remained with us was a Congo black, who\r\nevinced great address, bearing on his head a large dipping-needle:\r\nhe held it constantly steady, notwithstanding the extreme declivity\r\nof the rocks. The fog had dispersed by degrees in the bottom of the\r\nvalley; and the scattered lights we perceived below us caused a\r\ndouble illusion. The steeps appeared still more dangerous than they\r\nreally were; and, during six hours of continual descent, we seemed\r\nto be always equally near the farms at the foot of the Silla. We\r\nheard very distinctly the voices of men and the notes of guitars.\r\nSound is generally so well propagated upwards, that in a balloon at\r\nthe elevation of three thousand toises, the barking of dogs is\r\nsometimes heard.* (* Gay-Lussac's account of his ascent on the 15th\r\nof September, 1805.)\r\n\r\nWe did not arrive till ten at night at the bottom of the valley. We\r\nwere overcome with fatigue and thirst, having walked for fifteen\r\nhours, nearly without stopping. The soles of our feet were cut and\r\ntorn by the asperities of a rocky soil and the hard and dry stalks\r\nof the gramina, for we had been obliged to pull off our boots, the\r\nsoles having become too slippery. On declivities devoid of shrubs\r\nor ligneous herbs, which may be grasped by the hand, the danger of\r\nthe descent is diminished by walking barefoot. In order to shorten\r\nthe way, our guides conducted us from the Puerta de la Silla to the\r\nfarm of Gallegos by a path leading to a reservoir of water, called\r\nel Tanque. They missed their way, however; and this last descent,\r\nthe steepest of all, brought us near the ravine of Chacaito. The\r\nnoise of the cascades gave this nocturnal scene a grand and wild\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nWe passed the night at the foot of the Silla. Our friends at\r\nCaracas had been able to distinguish us with glasses on the summit\r\nof the eastern peak. They felt interested in hearing the account of\r\nour expedition, but they were not satisfied with the result of our\r\nmeasurement, which did not assign to the Silla even the elevation\r\nof the highest summit of the Pyrenees.* (* It was formerly believed\r\nthat the height of the Silla of Caracas scarcely differed from that\r\nof the peak of Teneriffe.) One cannot blame the national feeling\r\nwhich suggests exaggerated ideas of the monuments of nature, in a\r\ncountry in which the monuments of art are nothing; nor can we\r\nwonder that the inhabitants of Quito and Riobamba, who have prided\r\nthemselves for ages on the height of Chimborazo, mistrust those\r\nmeasurements which elevate the mountains of Himalaya above all the\r\ncolossal Cordilleras?\r\n\r\nDuring our journey to the Silla, and in all our excursions in the\r\nvalley of Caracas, we were very attentive to the lodes and\r\nindications of ore which we found in the strata of gneiss. No\r\nregular diggings having been made, we could only examine the\r\nfissures, the ravines, and the land-slips occasioned by torrents in\r\nthe rainy season. The rock of gneiss, passing sometimes into a\r\ngranite of new formation, sometimes into mica-slate,* (* Especially\r\nat great elevations.) belongs in Germany to the most metalliferous\r\nrocks; but in the New Continent, the gneiss has not hitherto been\r\nremarked as very rich in ores worth working. The most celebrated\r\nmines of Mexico and Peru are found in the primitive and transition\r\nschists, in the trap-porphyries, the grauwakke, and the alpine\r\nlimestones. In several spots of the valley of Caracas, the gneiss\r\ncontains a small quantity of gold, disseminated in small veins of\r\nquartz, sulphuretted silver, azure copper-ore, and galena; but it\r\nis doubtful whether these different metalliferous substances are\r\nnot too poor to encourage any attempt at working them. Such\r\nattempts were, however, made at the conquest of the province, about\r\nthe middle of the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nFrom the promontory of Paria to beyond cape Vela, the early\r\nnavigators had seen gold ornaments and gold dust, in the possession\r\nof the inhabitants of the coast. They penetrated into the interior\r\nof the country, to discover whence the precious metal came; and\r\nthough the information obtained in the province of Coro, and the\r\nmarkets of Curiana and Cauchieto,* (* The Spaniards found, in 1500,\r\nin the country of Curiana (now Coro), little birds, frogs, and\r\nother ornaments made of gold. Those who had cast these figures\r\nlived at Cauchieto, a place nearer the Rio de la Hacha. I have seen\r\nornaments resembling those described by Peter Martyr of Anghiera\r\n(which indicate tolerable skill in goldsmiths' work), among the\r\nremains of the ancient inhabitants of Cundinamarca. The same art\r\nappears to have been practised in places along the coasts, and also\r\nfarther to the south, among the mountains of New Grenada.) clearly\r\nproved that real mineral wealth was to be found only to the west\r\nand south-west of Coro (that is to say, in the mountains near those\r\nof New Grenada), the whole province of Caracas was nevertheless\r\neagerly explored. A governor, newly arrived on that coast, could\r\nrecommend himself to the Spanish court only by boasting of the\r\nmines of his province; and in order to take from cupidity what was\r\nmost ignoble and repulsive, the thirst of gold was justified by the\r\npurpose to which it was pretended the riches acquired by fraud and\r\nviolence might be employed. \"Gold,\" says Christopher Columbus, in\r\nhis last letter* (Lettera rarissima data nelle Indie nella isola di\r\nJamaica a 7 Julio dei 1503.--\"Le oro e metallo sopra gli altri\r\nexcellentissimo; e dell' oro si fanno li tesori e chi lo tiene fa e\r\nopera quanto vuole nel mondo[?], e finel[?]mente aggionge a mandare\r\nle anime al Paradiso.\") to King Ferdinand, \"gold is a thing so much\r\nthe more necessary to your majesty, because, in order to fulfil the\r\nancient prophecy, Jerusalem is to be rebuilt by a prince of the\r\nSpanish monarchy. Gold is the most excellent of metals. What\r\nbecomes of those precious stones, which are sought for at the\r\nextremities of the globe? They are sold, and are finally converted\r\ninto gold. With gold we not only do whatever we please in this\r\nworld, but we can even employ it to snatch souls from Purgatory,\r\nand to people Paradise.\" These words bear the stamp of the age in\r\nwhich Columbus lived; but we are surprised to see this pompous\r\neulogium of riches written by a man whose whole life was marked by\r\nthe most noble disinterestedness.\r\n\r\nThe conquest of the province of Venezuela having been begun at its\r\nwestern extremity, the neighbouring mountains of Coro, Tocuyo, and\r\nBarquisimeto, first attracted the attention of the Conquistadores.\r\nThese mountains join the Cordilleras of New Grenada (those of Santa\r\nFe, Pamplona, la Grita, and Merida) to the littoral chain of\r\nCaracas. It is a land the more interesting in a geognostical point\r\nof view, as no map has yet made known the mountainous ramifications\r\nwhich the paramos of Niquitao and Las Rosas send out towards the\r\nnorth-east. Between Tocuyo, Araure, and Barquisimeto, rises the\r\ngroup of the Altar Mountains, connected on the south-east with the\r\nparamo of Las Rosas. A branch of the Altar stretches north-east by\r\nSan Felipe el Fuerte, joining the granitic mountains of the coast\r\nnear Porto Cabello. The other branch takes an eastward direction\r\ntowards Nirgua and Tinaco, and joins the chain of the interior,\r\nthat of Yusma, Villa de Cura, and Sabana de Ocumare.\r\n\r\nThe region we have been here describing separates the waters which\r\nflow to the Orinoco from those which run into the immense lake of\r\nMaracaybo and the Caribbean Sea. It includes climates which may be\r\ntermed temperate rather than hot; and it is looked upon in the\r\ncountry, notwithstanding the distance of more than a hundred\r\nleagues, as a prolongation of the metalliferous soil of Pamplona.\r\nIt was in the group of the western mountains of Venezuela, that the\r\nSpaniards, in the year 1551, worked the gold mine of Buria,* (*\r\nReal de Minas de San Felipe de Buria.) which was the origin of the\r\nfoundation of the town of Barquisimeto.* (* Nueva Segovia.) But\r\nthese works, like many other mines successively opened, were soon\r\nabandoned. Here, as in all the mountains of Venezuela, the produce\r\nof the ore has been found to be very variable. The lodes are very\r\noften divided, or they altogether cease; and the metals appear only\r\nin kidney-ores, and present the most delusive appearances. It is,\r\nhowever, only in this group of mountains of San Felipe and\r\nBarquisimeto, that the working of mines has been continued till the\r\npresent time. Those of Aroa, near San Felipe el Fuerte, situated in\r\nthe centre of a very insalubrious country, are the only mines which\r\nare wrought in the whole capitania-general of Caracas. They yield a\r\nsmall quantity of copper.\r\n\r\nNext to the works at Buria, near Barquisimeto, those of the valley\r\nof Caracas, and of the mountains near the capital, are the most\r\nancient. Francisco Faxardo and his wife Isabella, of the nation of\r\nthe Guaiquerias,* often visited the table-land where the capital of\r\nVenezuela is now situated. (* Faxardo and his wife were the\r\nfounders of the town of the Collado, now called Caravalleda.) They\r\nhad given this table-land the name of Valle de San Francisco; and\r\nhaving seen some bits of gold in the hands of the natives, Faxardo\r\nsucceeded, in the year 1560, in discovering the mines of Los\r\nTeques,* to the south-west of Caracas, near the group of the\r\nmountains of Cocuiza, which separate the valleys of Caracas and\r\nAragua. (* Thirteen years later, in 1573, Gabriel de Avila, one of\r\nthe alcaldes of the new town of Caracas, renewed the working of\r\nthese mines, which were from that time called the \"Real de Minas de\r\nNuestra Senora.\" Probably this same Avila, on account of a few\r\nfarms which he possessed in the mountains adjacent to La Guayra and\r\nCaracas, has occasioned the Cumbre to receive the name of Montana\r\nde Avila. This name has subsequently been applied erroneously to\r\nthe Silla, and to all the chain which extends towards cape Codera.)\r\nIt is thought that in the first of these valleys, near Baruta,\r\nsouth of the village of Valle, the natives had made some\r\nexcavations in veins of auriferous quartz; and that, when the\r\nSpaniards first settled there, and founded the town of Caracas,\r\nthey filled the shafts, which had been dry, with water. It is now\r\nimpossible to ascertain this fact; but it is certain that, long\r\nbefore the Conquest, grains of gold were a medium of exchange, I do\r\nnot say generally, but among certain nations of the New Continent.\r\nThey gave gold for the purchase of pearls; and it does not appear\r\nextraordinary, that, after having for a long time picked up grains\r\nof gold in the rivulets, people who had fixed habitations, and were\r\ndevoted to agriculture, should have tried to trace the auriferous\r\nveins in the superior surface of the soil. The mines of Los Teques\r\ncould not be peaceably wrought, till the defeat of the Cacique\r\nGuaycaypuro, a celebrated chief of the Teques, who long contested\r\nwith the Spaniards the possession of the province of Venezuela.\r\n\r\nWe have yet to mention a third point to which the attention of the\r\nConquistadores was called by indications of mines, so early as the\r\nend of the sixteenth century. In following the valley of Caracas\r\neastward beyond Caurimare, on the road to Caucagua, we reach a\r\nmountainous and woody country, where a great quantity of charcoal\r\nis now made, and which anciently bore the name of the Province of\r\nLos Mariches. In these eastern mountains of Venezuela, the gneiss\r\npasses into the state of talc. It contains, as at Salzburg, lodes\r\nof auriferous quartz. The works anciently begun in those mines have\r\noften been abandoned and resumed.\r\n\r\nThe mines of Caracas were forgotten during more than a hundred\r\nyears. But at a period comparatively recent, about the end of the\r\nlast century, an Intendant of Venezuela, Don Jose Avalo, again fell\r\ninto the illusions which had flattered the cupidity of the\r\nConquistadores. He fancied that all the mountains near the capital\r\ncontained great metallic riches. Some Mexican miners were engaged,\r\nand their operations were directed to the ravine of Tipe, and the\r\nancient mines of Baruta to the south of Caracas, where the Indians\r\ngather even now some little gold-washings. But the zeal which had\r\nprompted the enterprise soon diminished, and after much useless\r\nexpense, the working of the mines of Caracas was totally abandoned.\r\nA small quantity of auriferous pyrites, sulphuretted silver, and a\r\nlittle native gold, were found; but these were only feeble\r\nindications; and in a country where labour is extremely dear, there\r\nwas no inducement to pursue works so little productive.\r\n\r\nWe visited the ravine of Tipe, situated in that part of the valley\r\nwhich opens in the direction of Cabo Blanco. Proceeding from\r\nCaracas, we traverse, in the direction of the great barracks of San\r\nCarlos, a barren and rocky soil. Only a very few plants of Argemone\r\nmexicana are to be found. The gneiss appears everywhere above\r\nground. We might have fancied ourselves on the table-land of\r\nFreiberg. We crossed first the little rivulet of Agua Salud, a\r\nlimpid stream, which has no mineral taste, and then the Rio\r\nGaraguata. The road is commanded on the right by the Cerro de Avila\r\nand the Cumbre; and on the left, by the mountains of Aguas Negras.\r\nThis defile is very interesting in a geological point of view. At\r\nthis spot the valley of Caracas communicates, by the valleys of\r\nTacagua and of Tipe, with the coast near Catia. A ridge of rock,\r\nthe summit of which is forty toises above the bottom of the valley\r\nof Caracas, and more than three hundred toises above the valley of\r\nTacagua, divides the waters which flow into the Rio Guayra and\r\ntowards Cabo Blanco. On this point of division, at the entrance of\r\nthe branch, the view is highly pleasing. The climate changes as we\r\ndescend westward. In the valley of Tacagua we found some new\r\nhabitations, and also conucos of maize and plantains. A very\r\nextensive plantation of tuna, or cactus, stamps this barren country\r\nwith a peculiar character. The cactuses reach the height of fifteen\r\nfeet, and grow in the form of candelabra, like the euphorbia of\r\nAfrica. They are cultivated for the purpose of selling their\r\nrefreshing fruits in the market of Caracas. The variety which has\r\nno thorns is called, strangely enough, in the colonies, tuna de\r\nEspana (Spanish cactus). We measured, at the same place, magueys or\r\nagaves, the long stems of which, laden with flowers, were\r\nforty-four feet high. However common this plant is become in the\r\nsouth of Europe, the native of a northern climate is never weary of\r\nadmiring the rapid development of a liliaceous plant, which\r\ncontains at once a sweet juice and astringent and caustic liquids,\r\nemployed to cauterize wounds.\r\n\r\nWe found several veins of quartz in the valley of Tipe visible\r\nabove the soil. They contained pyrites, carbonated iron-ore, traces\r\nof sulphuretted silver (glasserz), and grey copper-ore (fahlerz).\r\nThe works which had been undertaken, either for extracting the ore,\r\nor exploring the nature of its bed, appeared to be very\r\nsuperficial. The earth falling in had filled up those excavations,\r\nand we could not judge of the richness of the lode. Notwithstanding\r\nthe expense incurred under the intendancy of Don Jose Avalo, the\r\ngreat question whether the province of Venezuela contains mines\r\nrich enough to be worked, is yet problematical. Though in countries\r\nwhere hands are wanting, the culture of the soil demands\r\nunquestionably the first care of the government, yet the example of\r\nNew Spain sufficiently proves that mining is not always\r\nunfavourable to the progress of agriculture. The best-cultivated\r\nMexican lands, those which remind the traveller of the most\r\nbeautiful districts of France and the south of Germany, extend from\r\nSilao towards the Villa of Leon: they are in the neighbourhood of\r\nthe mines of Guanaxuato, which alone furnish a sixth part of all\r\nthe silver of the New World.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.14.\r\n\r\nEARTHQUAKES AT CARACAS.\r\nCONNECTION OF THOSE PHENOMENA WITH THE VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS\r\n  OF THE WEST INDIA ISLANDS.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 7th of February we took our departure from\r\nCaracas. Since the period of our visit to that place, tremendous\r\nearthquakes have changed the surface of the soil. The city, which I\r\nhave described, has disappeared; and on the same spot, on the\r\nground fissured in various directions, another city is now slowly\r\nrising. The heaps of ruins, which were the grave of a numerous\r\npopulation, are becoming anew the habitation of men. In retracing\r\nchanges of so general an interest, I shall be led to notice events\r\nwhich took place long after my return to Europe. I shall pass over\r\nin silence the popular commotions which have taken place, and the\r\nmodifications which society has undergone. Modern nations, careful\r\nof their own remembrances, snatch from oblivion the history of\r\nhuman revolutions, which is, in fact, the history of ardent\r\npassions and inveterate hatred. It is not the same with respect to\r\nthe revolutions of the physical world. These are described with\r\nleast accuracy when they happen to be contemporary with civil\r\ndissensions. Earthquakes and eruptions of volcanoes strike the\r\nimagination by the evils which are their necessary consequence.\r\nTradition seizes on whatever is vague and marvellous; and amid\r\ngreat public calamities, as in private misfortunes, man seems to\r\nshun that light which leads us to discover the real causes of\r\nevents, and to understand the circumstances by which they are\r\nattended.\r\n\r\nI have recorded in this work all I have been able to collect, and\r\non the accuracy of which I can rely, respecting the earthquake of\r\nthe 26th of March, 1812. By that catastrophe the town of Caracas\r\nwas destroyed, and more than twenty thousand persons perished\r\nthroughout the extent of the province of Venezuela. The intercourse\r\nwhich I have kept up with persons of all classes has enabled me to\r\ncompare the description given by many eye-witnesses, and to\r\ninterrogate them on objects that may throw light on physical\r\nscience in general. The traveller, as the historian of nature,\r\nshould verify the dates of great catastrophes, examine their\r\nconnection and their mutual relations, and should mark in the rapid\r\ncourse of ages, in the continual progress of successive changes,\r\nthose fixed points with which other catastrophes may one day be\r\ncompared. All epochs are proximate to each other in the immensity\r\nof time comprehended in the history of nature. Years which have\r\npassed away seem but a few instants; and the physical descriptions\r\nof a country, even when they offer subjects of no very powerful and\r\ngeneral interest, have at least the advantage of never becoming\r\nold. Similar considerations, no doubt, led M. de la Condamine to\r\ndescribe in his Voyage a l'Equateur, the memorable eruptions of the\r\nvolcano of Cotopaxi,* which took place long after his departure\r\nfrom Quito. (* Those of the 30th of November, 1744, and of the 3rd\r\nof September, 1750.) I feel the less hesitation in following the\r\nexample of that celebrated traveller, as the events I am about to\r\nrelate will help to elucidate the theory of volcanic reaction, or\r\nthe influence of a system of volcanoes on a vast space of\r\ncircumjacent territory.\r\n\r\nAt the time when M. Bonpland and myself visited the provinces of\r\nNew Andalusia, New Barcelona, and Caracas, it was generally\r\nbelieved that the most eastern parts of those coasts were\r\nespecially exposed to the destructive effects of earthquakes. The\r\ninhabitants of Cumana dreaded the valley of Caracas, on account of\r\nits damp and variable climate, and its gloomy and misty sky; whilst\r\nthe inhabitants of the temperate valley regarded Cumana as a town\r\nwhose inhabitants incessantly inhaled a burning atmosphere, and\r\nwhose soil was periodically agitated by violent commotions.\r\nUnmindful of the overthrow of Riobamba and other very elevated\r\ntowns, and not aware that the peninsula of Araya, composed of\r\nmica-slate, shares the commotions of the calcareous coast of\r\nCumana, well-informed persons imagined they discerned security in\r\nthe structure of the primitive rocks of Caracas, as well as in the\r\nelevated situation of this valley. Religious ceremonies celebrated\r\nat La Guayra, and even in the capital, in the middle of the night,*\r\ndoubtless called to mind the fact that the province of Venezuela\r\nhad been subject at intervals to earthquakes; but dangers of rare\r\noccurrence are slightly feared. (* For instance, the nocturnal\r\nprocession of the 21st of October, instituted in commemoration of\r\nthe great earthquake which took place on that day of the month, at\r\none o'clock in the morning, in 1778. Other very violent shocks were\r\nthose of 1641, 1703, and 1802.) However, in the year 1811, fatal\r\nexperience destroyed the illusion of theory and of popular opinion.\r\nCaracas, situated in the mountains, three degrees west of Cumana,\r\nand five degrees west of the volcanoes of the Caribbee islands, has\r\nsuffered greater shocks than were ever experienced on the coast of\r\nParia or New Andalusia.\r\n\r\nAt my arrival in Terra Firma, I was struck with the connection\r\nbetween the destruction of Cumana on the 14th of December, 1797,\r\nand the eruption of the volcanoes in the smaller West India\r\nIslands. This connection was again manifest in the destruction of\r\nCaracas on the 26th of March, 1812. The volcano of Guadaloupe\r\nseemed in 1797 to have exercised a reaction on the coasts of\r\nCumana. Fifteen years later, it was a volcano situated nearer the\r\ncontinent (that of St. Vincent), which appeared to have extended\r\nits influence as far as Caracas and the banks of Apure. Possibly,\r\nat both those periods, the centre of the explosion was, at an\r\nimmense depth, equally distant from the regions towards which the\r\nmotion was propagated at the surface of the globe.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of 1811 to 1813, a vast superficies of the\r\nearth,* (* Between latitudes 5 and 36 degrees north, and 31 and 91\r\ndegrees west longitude from Paris.) bound by the meridian of the\r\nAzores, the valley of the Ohio, the Cordilleras of New Grenada, the\r\ncoasts of Venezuela, and the volcanoes of the smaller West India\r\nIslands, was shaken throughout its whole extent, by commotions\r\nwhich may be attributed to subterranean fires. The following series\r\nof phenomena seems to indicate communications at enormous\r\ndistances. On the 30th of January, 1811, a submarine volcano broke\r\nout near the island of St. Michael, one of the Azores. At a place\r\nwhere the sea was sixty fathoms deep, a rock made its appearance\r\nabove the surface of the waters. The heaving-up of the softened\r\ncrust of the globe appears to have preceded the eruption of flame\r\nat the crater, as had already been observed at the volcanoes of\r\nJorullo in Mexico, and on the appearance of the little island of\r\nKameni, near Santorino. The new islet of the Azores was at first a\r\nmere shoal; but on the 15th of June, an eruption, which lasted six\r\ndays, enlarged its extent, and carried it progressively to the\r\nheight of fifty toises above the surface of the sea. This new land,\r\nof which captain Tillard took possession in the name of the British\r\ngovernment, giving it the name of Sabrina Island, was nine hundred\r\ntoises in diameter. It has again, it seems, been swallowed up by\r\nthe ocean. This is the third time that submarine volcanoes have\r\npresented this extraordinary spectacle near the island of St.\r\nMichael; and, as if the eruptions of these volcanoes were subject\r\nto periodical recurrence, owing to a certain accumulation of\r\nelastic fluids, the island raised up has appeared at intervals of\r\nninety-one or ninety-two years.* (* Malte-Brun, Geographie\r\nUniverselle. There is, however, some doubt respecting the eruption\r\nof 1628, to which some accounts assign the date of 1638. The rising\r\nalways happened near the island of St. Michael, though not\r\nidentically on the same spot. It is remarkable that the small\r\nisland of 1720 reached the same elevation as the island of Sabrina\r\nin 1811.)\r\n\r\nAt the time of the appearance of the new island of Sabrina, the\r\nsmaller West India Islands, situated eight hundred leagues\r\nsouth-west of the Azores, experienced frequent earthquakes. More\r\nthan two hundred shocks were felt from the month of May 1811, to\r\nApril 1812, at St. Vincent; one of the three islands in which there\r\nare still active volcanoes. The commotion was not circumscribed to\r\nthe insular portion of eastern America; and from the 16th of\r\nDecember, 1811, till the year 1813, the earth was almost\r\nincessantly agitated in the valleys of the Mississippi, the\r\nArkansas river, and the Ohio. The oscillations were more feeble on\r\nthe east of the Alleghanies, than to the west of these mountains,\r\nin Tennessee and Kentucky. They were accompanied by a great\r\nsubterranean noise, proceeding from the south-west. In some places\r\nbetween New Madrid and Little Prairie, as at the Saline, north of\r\nCincinnati, in latitude 37 degrees 45 minutes, shocks were felt\r\nevery day, nay almost every hour, during several months. The whole\r\nof these phenomena continued from the 16th of December 1811, till\r\nthe year 1813. The commotion, confined at first to the south, in\r\nthe valley of the lower Mississippi, appeared to advance slowly\r\nnorthward.\r\n\r\nPrecisely at the period when this long series of earthquakes\r\ncommenced in the Transalleghanian States (in the month of December\r\n1811), the town of Caracas felt the first shock in calm and serene\r\nweather. This coincidence of phenomena was probably not accidental;\r\nfor it must be borne in mind that, notwithstanding the distance\r\nwhich separates these countries, the low grounds of Louisiana and\r\nthe coasts of Venezuela and Cumana belong to the same basin, that\r\nof the Gulf of Mexico. When we consider geologically the basin of\r\nthe Caribbean Sea, and of the Gulf of Mexico, we find it bounded on\r\nthe south by the coast-chain of Venezuela and the Cordilleras of\r\nMerida and Pamplona; on the east by the mountains of the West India\r\nIslands, and the Alleghanies; on the west by the Andes of Mexico,\r\nand the Rocky Mountains; and on the north by the very\r\ninconsiderable elevations which separate the Canadian lakes from\r\nthe rivers which flow into the Mississippi. More than two-thirds of\r\nthis basin are covered with water. It is bordered by two ranges of\r\nactive volcanoes; on the east, in the Carribee Islands, between\r\nlatitudes 13 and 16 degrees; and on the west in the Cordilleras of\r\nNicaragua, Guatimala, and Mexico, between latitudes 11 and 20\r\ndegrees. When we reflect that the great earthquake at Lisbon, of\r\nthe 1st of November, 1755, was felt almost simultaneously on the\r\ncoasts of Sweden, at lake Ontario, and at the island of Martinique,\r\nit may not seem unreasonable to suppose, that all this basin of the\r\nWest Indies, from Cumana and Caracas as far as the plains of\r\nLouisiana, should be simultaneously agitated by commotions\r\nproceeding from the same centre of action.\r\n\r\nIt is an opinion very generally prevalent on the coasts of Terra\r\nFirma, that earthquakes become more frequent when electric\r\nexplosions have been during some years rare. It is supposed to have\r\nbeen observed, at Cumana and at Caracas, that the rains were less\r\nfrequently attended with thunder from the year 1792; and the total\r\ndestruction of Cumana in 1797, as well as the commotions felt in\r\n1800, 1801, and 1802, at Maracaibo, Porto Cabello, and Caracas,\r\nhave not failed to be attributed to an accumulation of electricity\r\nin the interior of the earth. Persons who have lived long in New\r\nAndalusia, or in the low regions of Peru, will admit that the\r\nperiod most to be dreaded for the frequency of earthquakes is the\r\nbeginning of the rainy season, which, however, is also the season\r\nof thunder-storms. The atmosphere and the state of the surface of\r\nthe globe seem to exercise an influence unknown to us on the\r\nchanges which take place at great depths; and I am inclined to\r\nthink that the connection which it is supposed has been traced\r\nbetween the absence of thunder-storms and the frequency of\r\nearthquakes, is rather a physical hypothesis framed by the\r\nhalf-learned of the country than the result of long experience. The\r\ncoincidence of certain phenomena may be favoured by chance. The\r\nextraordinary commotions felt almost continually during the space\r\nof two years on the banks of the Mississippi and the Ohio, and\r\nwhich corresponded in 1812 with those of the valley of Caracas,\r\nwere preceded at Louisiana by a year almost exempt from\r\nthunder-storms. The public mind was again struck with this\r\nphenomenon. We cannot be surprised that there should be in the\r\nnative land of Franklin a great readiness to receive explanations\r\nfounded on the theory of electricity.\r\n\r\nThe shock felt at Caracas in the month of December 1811, was the\r\nonly one which preceded the terrible catastrophe of the 26th of\r\nMarch, 1812. The inhabitants of Terra Firma were alike ignorant of\r\nthe agitations of the volcano in the island of St. Vincent, and of\r\nthose felt in the basin of the Mississippi, where, on the 7th and\r\n8th of February, 1812, the earth was day and night in perpetual\r\noscillation. A great drought prevailed at this period in the\r\nprovince of Venezuela. Not a single drop of rain had fallen at\r\nCaracas or in the country to the distance of ninety leagues round,\r\nduring five months preceding the destruction of the capital. The\r\n26th of March was a remarkably hot day. The air was calm, and the\r\nsky unclouded. It was Ascension-day, and a great portion of the\r\npopulation was assembled in the churches. Nothing seemed to presage\r\nthe calamities of the day. At seven minutes after four in the\r\nafternoon the first shock was felt. It was sufficiently forcible to\r\nmake the bells of the churches toll; and it lasted five or six\r\nseconds. During that interval the ground was in a continual\r\nundulating movement, and seemed to heave up like a boiling liquid.\r\nThe danger was thought to be past, when a tremendous subterranean\r\nnoise was heard, resembling the rolling of thunder, but louder and\r\nof longer continuance than that heard within the tropics in the\r\ntime of storms. This noise preceded a perpendicular motion of three\r\nor four seconds, followed by an undulatory movement somewhat\r\nlonger. The shocks were in opposite directions, proceeding from\r\nnorth to south, and from east to west. Nothing could resist the\r\nperpendicular movement and the transverse undulations. The town of\r\nCaracas was entirely overthrown, and between nine and ten thousand\r\nof the inhabitants were buried under the ruins of the houses and\r\nchurches. The procession of Ascension-day had not yet begun to pass\r\nthrough the streets, but the crowd was so great within the churches\r\nthat nearly three or four thousand persons were crushed by the fall\r\nof the roofs. The explosion was most violent towards the north, in\r\nthat part of the town situated nearest the mountain of Avila and\r\nthe Silla. The churches of la Trinidad and Alta Gracia, which were\r\nmore than one hundred and fifty feet high, and the naves of which\r\nwere supported by pillars of twelve or fifteen feet diameter, were\r\nreduced to a mass of ruins scarcely exceeding five or six feet in\r\nelevation. The sinking of the ruins has been so considerable that\r\nthere now scarcely remain any vestiges of pillars or columns. The\r\nbarracks, called el Quartel de San Carlos, situated north of the\r\nchurch of la Trinidad, on the road from the custom-house of La\r\nPastora, almost entirely disappeared. A regiment of troops of the\r\nline, under arms, and in readiness to join the procession, was,\r\nwith the exception of a few men, buried beneath the ruins of the\r\nbarracks. Nine-tenths of the fine city of Caracas were entirely\r\ndestroyed. The walls of some houses not thrown down, as those in\r\nthe street San Juan, near the Capuchin Hospital, were cracked in\r\nsuch a manner as to render them uninhabitable. The effects of the\r\nearthquake were somewhat less violent in the western and southern\r\nparts of the city, between the principal square and the ravine of\r\nCaraguata. There, the cathedral, supported by enormous buttresses,\r\nremains standing.\r\n\r\nIt is computed that nine or ten thousand persons were killed in the\r\ncity of Caracas, exclusive of those who, being dangerously wounded,\r\nperished several months after, for want of food and proper care.\r\nThe night of the Festival of the Ascension witnessed an awful scene\r\nof desolation and distress. The thick cloud of dust which, rising\r\nabove the ruins, darkened the sky like a fog, had settled on the\r\nground. No commotion was felt, and never was a night more calm or\r\nmore serene. The moon, then nearly at the full, illumined the\r\nrounded domes of the Silla, and the aspect of the sky formed a\r\nperfect contrast to that of the earth, which was covered with the\r\nbodies of the dead, and heaped with ruins. Mothers were seen\r\nbearing in their arms their children, whom they hoped to recall to\r\nlife. Desolate families were wandering through the city, seeking a\r\nbrother, a husband, or a friend, of whose fate they were ignorant,\r\nand whom they believed to be lost in the crowd. The people pressed\r\nalong the streets, which could be traced only by long lines of\r\nruins.\r\n\r\nAll the calamities experienced in the great catastrophes of Lisbon,\r\nMessina, Lima, and Riobamba were renewed at Caracas on the fatal\r\n26th of March, 1812. Wounded persons, buried beneath the ruins,\r\nwere heard imploring by their cries the help of the passers-by, and\r\nnearly two thousand were dug out. Never was pity more tenderly\r\nevinced; never was it more ingeniously active than in the efforts\r\nemployed to save the miserable victims whose groans reached the\r\near. Implements for digging and clearing away the ruins were\r\nentirely wanting; and the people were obliged to use their bare\r\nhands, to disinter the living. The wounded, as well as the invalids\r\nwho had escaped from the hospitals, were laid on the banks of the\r\nsmall river Guayra, where there was no shelter but the foliage of\r\ntrees. Beds, linen to dress the wounds, instruments of surgery,\r\nmedicines, every object of the most urgent necessity, was buried in\r\nthe ruins. Everything, even food, was wanting; and for the space of\r\nseveral days water became scarce in the interior of the city. The\r\ncommotion had rent the pipes of the fountains; and the falling in\r\nof the earth had choked up the springs that supplied them. To\r\nprocure water it was necessary to go down to the river Guayra,\r\nwhich was considerably swelled; and even when the water was\r\nobtained vessels for conveying it were wanting.\r\n\r\nThere was a duty to be fulfilled to the dead, enjoined at once by\r\npiety and the dread of infection. It being impossible to inter so\r\nmany thousand bodies, half-buried under the ruins, commissioners\r\nwere appointed to burn them: and for this purpose funeral piles\r\nwere erected between the heaps of ruins. This ceremony lasted\r\nseveral days. Amidst so many public calamities, the people devoted\r\nthemselves to those religious duties which they thought best fitted\r\nto appease the wrath of heaven. Some, assembling in processions,\r\nsang funeral hymns; others, in a state of distraction, made their\r\nconfessions aloud in the streets. In Caracas was then repeated what\r\nhad been remarked in the province of Quito, after the tremendous\r\nearthquake of 1797; a number of marriages were contracted between\r\npersons who had neglected for many years to sanction their union by\r\nthe sacerdotal benediction. Children found parents, by whom they\r\nhad never till then been acknowledged; restitutions were promised\r\nby persons who had never been accused of fraud; and families who\r\nhad long been at enmity were drawn together by the tie of common\r\ncalamity. But if this feeling seemed to calm the passions of some,\r\nand open the heart to pity, it had a contrary effect on others,\r\nrendering them more rigorous and inhuman. In great calamities\r\nvulgar minds evince less of goodness than of energy. Misfortune\r\nacts in the same manner as the pursuits of literature and the study\r\nof nature; the happy influence of which is felt only by a few,\r\ngiving more ardour to sentiment, more elevation to the thoughts,\r\nand increased benevolence to the disposition.\r\n\r\nShocks as violent as those which in about the space of a minute*\r\noverthrew the city of Caracas, could not be confined to a small\r\nportion of the continent. (* The duration of the earthquake, that\r\nis to say the whole of the movements of undulation and rising\r\n(undulacion y trepidacion), which occasioned the horrible\r\ncatastrophe of the 26th of March, 1812, was estimated by some at 50\r\nseconds, by others at 1 minute 12 seconds.) Their fatal effects\r\nextended as far as the provinces of Venezuela, Varinas, and\r\nMaracaibo, along the coast; and especially to the inland mountains.\r\nLa Guayra, Mayquetia, Antimano, Baruta, La Vega, San Felipe, and\r\nMerida, were almost entirely destroyed. The number of the dead\r\nexceeded four or five thousand at La Guayra, and at the town of San\r\nFelipe, near the copper-mines of Aroa. It would appear that on a\r\nline running east-north-east and west-south-west from La Guayra and\r\nCaracas to the lofty mountains of Niquitao and Merida, the violence\r\nof the earthquake was principally directed. It was felt in the\r\nkingdom of New Grenada from the branches of the high Sierra de\r\nSanta Martha* (* As far as Villa de Los Remedios, and even to\r\nCarthagena.) as far as Santa Fe de Bogota and Honda, on the banks\r\nof the Magdalena, one hundred and eighty leagues from Caracas. It\r\nwas everywhere more violent in the Cordilleras of gneiss and\r\nmica-slate, or immediately at their base, than in the plains; and\r\nthis difference was particularly striking in the savannahs of\r\nVarinas and Casanara.* (* This is easily explained according to the\r\nsystem of those geologists who are of opinion that all chains of\r\nmountains, volcanic and not volcanic, have been formed by being\r\nraised up, as if through crevices.) In the valleys of Aragua,\r\nbetween Caracas and the town of San Felipe, the commotions were\r\nvery slight; and La Victoria, Maracay, and Valencia, scarcely\r\nsuffered at all, notwithstanding their proximity to the capital. At\r\nValecillo, a few leagues from Valencia, the yawning earth threw out\r\nsuch an immense quantity of water, that it formed a new torrent.\r\nThe same phenomenon took place near Porto-Cabello.* (* It is\r\nasserted that, in the mountains of Aroa, the ground, immediately\r\nafter the great shocks, was found covered with a very fine and\r\nwhite earth, which appeared to have been projected through\r\ncrevices.) On the other hand, the lake of Maracaybo diminished\r\nsensibly. At Coro no commotion was felt, though the town is\r\nsituated on the coast, between other towns which suffered from the\r\nearthquake. Fishermen, who had passed the day of the 26th of March\r\nin the island of Orchila, thirty leagues north-east of La Guayra,\r\nfelt no shock. These differences in the direction and propagation\r\nof the shock, are probably owing to the peculiar position of the\r\nstony strata.\r\n\r\nHaving thus traced the effects of the earthquake to the west of\r\nCaracas, as far as the snowy mountains of Santa Martha, and the\r\ntable-land of Santa Fe de Bogota, we will proceed to consider their\r\naction on the country eastward of the capital. The commotions were\r\nvery violent beyond Caurimare, in the valley of Capaya, where they\r\nextended as far as the meridian of Cape Codera: but it is extremely\r\nremarkable that they were very feeble on the coasts of Nueva\r\nBarcelona, Cumana, and Paria; though these coasts are the\r\ncontinuation of the shore of La Guayra, and were formerly known to\r\nhave been often agitated by subterranean commotions. Admitting that\r\nthe destruction of the four towns of Caracas, La Guayra, San\r\nFelipe, and Merida, may be attributed to a volcanic focus situated\r\nunder or near the island of St. Vincent, we may conceive that the\r\nmotion might have been propagated from north-east to south-west in\r\na line passing through the islands of Los Hermanos, near\r\nBlanquilla, without touching the coasts of Araya, Cumana, and Nueva\r\nBarcelona. This propagation of the shock might even have taken\r\nplace without any commotion having been felt at the intermediate\r\npoints on the surface of the globe (the Hermanos Islands for\r\ninstance). This phenomenon is frequently remarked at Peru and\r\nMexico, in earthquakes which have followed during ages a fixed\r\ndirection. The inhabitants of the Andes say, speaking of an\r\nintermediary tract of ground, not affected by the general\r\ncommotion, \"that it forms a bridge\" (que hace puente): as if they\r\nmean to indicate by this expression that the undulations are\r\npropagated at an immense depth under an inert rock.\r\n\r\nAt Caracas, fifteen or eighteen hours after the great catastrophe,\r\nthe earth was tranquil. The night, as has already been observed,\r\nwas fine and calm; and the commotions did not recommence till after\r\nthe 27th. They were then attended by a very loud and long continued\r\nsubterranean noise (bramido). The inhabitants of the destroyed city\r\nwandered into the country; but the villages and farms having\r\nsuffered as much as the town, they could find no shelter till they\r\nwere beyond the mountains of los Teques, in the valleys of Aragua,\r\nand in the llanos or savannahs. No less than fifteen oscillations\r\nwere felt in one day. On the 5th of April there was almost as\r\nviolent an earthquake as that which overthrew the capital. During\r\nseveral hours the ground was in a state of perpetual undulation.\r\nLarge heaps of earth fell in the mountains; and enormous masses of\r\nrock were detached from the Silla of Caracas. It was even asserted,\r\nand this opinion prevails still in the country, that the two domes\r\nof the Silla sunk fifty or sixty toises; but this statement is not\r\nfounded on any measurement. I am informed that, in like manner, in\r\nthe province of Quito, the people, at every period of great\r\ncommotions, imagine that the volcano of Tunguragua diminishes in\r\nheight. It has been affirmed, in many published accounts of the\r\ndestruction of Caracas, that the mountain of the Silla is an\r\nextinguished volcano; that a great quantity of volcanic substances\r\nare found on the road from La Guayra to Caracas; that the rocks do\r\nnot present any regular stratification; and that everything bears\r\nthe stamp of the action of fire. It has even been stated that\r\ntwelve years prior to the great catastrophe, M. Bonpland and myself\r\nhad, from our own observations, considered the Silla as a very\r\ndangerous neighbour to the city of Caracas, because the mountain\r\ncontained a great quantity of sulphur, and the commotions must come\r\nfrom the north-east. It is seldom that observers of nature have to\r\njustify themselves for an accomplished prediction; but I think it\r\nmy duty to oppose ideas which are too easily adopted on the LOCAL\r\nCAUSES of earthquakes.\r\n\r\nIn all places where the soil has been incessantly agitated for\r\nwhole months, as at Jamaica in 1693, Lisbon in 1755, Cumana in\r\n1766, and Piedmont in 1808, a volcano is expected to open. People\r\nforget that we must seek the focus or centre of action, far from\r\nthe surface of the earth; that, according to undeniable evidence,\r\nthe undulations are propagated almost at the same instant across\r\nseas of immense depth, at the distance of a thousand leagues; and\r\nthat the greatest commotions take place not at the foot of active\r\nvolcanoes, but in chains of mountains composed of the most\r\nheterogeneous rocks. In our geognostical observation of the country\r\nround Caracas we found gneiss, and mica-slate containing beds of\r\nprimitive limestone. The strata are scarcely more fractured or\r\nirregularly inclined than near Freyburg in Saxony, or wherever\r\nmountains of primitive formation rise abruptly to great heights. I\r\nfound at Caracas neither basalt nor dorolite, nor even trachytes or\r\ntrap-porphyries; nor in general any trace of an extinguished\r\nvolcano, unless we choose to regard the diabases of primitive\r\ngrunstein, contained in gneiss, as masses of lava, which have\r\nfilled up fissures. These diabases are the same as those of\r\nBohemia, Saxony, and Franconia;* (* These grunsteins are found in\r\nBohemia, near Pilsen, in granite; in Saxony, in the mica-slates of\r\nScheenberg; in Franconia, between Steeben and Lauenstein, in\r\ntransition-slates.) and whatever opinion may be entertained\r\nrespecting the ancient causes of the oxidation of the globe at its\r\nsurface, all those primitive mountains, which contain a mixture of\r\nhornblende and feldspar, either in veins or in balls with\r\nconcentric layers, will not, I presume, be called volcanic\r\nformations. Mont Blanc and Mont d'Or will not be ranged in one and\r\nthe same class. Even the partisans of the Huttonian or volcanic\r\ntheory make a distinction between the lavas melted under the mere\r\npressure of the atmosphere at the surface of the globe, and those\r\nlayers formed by fire beneath the immense weight of the ocean and\r\nsuperincumbent rocks. They would not confound Auvergne and the\r\ngranitic valley of Caracas in the same denomination; that of a\r\ncountry of extinct volcanoes.\r\n\r\nI never could have pronounced the opinion, that the Silla and the\r\nCerro de Avila, mountains of gneiss and mica-slate, were in\r\ndangerous proximity to the city of Caracas because they contained a\r\ngreat quantity of pyrites in subordinate beds of primitive\r\nlimestone. But I remember having said, during my stay at Caracas,\r\nthat the eastern extremity of Terra Firma appeared, since the great\r\nearthquake of Quito, in a state of agitation, which warranted\r\napprehension that the province of Venezuela would gradually be\r\nexposed to violent commotions. I added, that when a country had\r\nbeen long subject to frequent shocks, new subterranean\r\ncommunications seemed to open with neighbouring countries; and that\r\nthe volcanoes of the West India Islands, lying in the direction of\r\nthe Silla, north-east of the city, were perhaps the vents, at the\r\ntime of an eruption, for those elastic fluids which cause\r\nearthquakes on the coasts of the continent. These considerations,\r\nfounded on local knowledge of the place, and on simple analogies,\r\nare very far from a prediction justified by the course of physical\r\nevents.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of April, 1812, whilst violent commotions were felt\r\nsimultaneously in the valley of the Mississippi, in the island of\r\nSt. Vincent, and in the province of Venezuela, a subterranean noise\r\nresembling frequent discharges of large cannon was heard at\r\nCaracas, at Calabozo (situated in the midst of the steppes), and on\r\nthe borders of the Rio Apure, over a superficies of four thousand\r\nsquare leagues. This noise began at two in the morning. It was\r\naccompanied by no shock; and it is very remarkable, that it was as\r\nloud on the coast as at the distance of eighty leagues inland. It\r\nwas everywhere believed to be transmitted through the air; and was\r\nso far from being thought a subterranean noise, that in several\r\nplaces, preparations were made for defence against an enemy, who\r\nseemed to be advancing with heavy artillery. Senor Palacio,\r\ncrossing the Rio Apure below the Orivante, near the junction of the\r\nRio Nula, was told by the inhabitants, that the firing of cannon\r\nhad been heard distinctly at the western extremity of the province\r\nof Varinas, as well as at the port of La Guayra to the north of the\r\nchain of the coast.\r\n\r\nThe day on which the inhabitants of Terra Firma were alarmed by a\r\nsubterranean noise was that of the great eruption of the volcano in\r\nthe island of St. Vincent. That mountain, near five hundred toises\r\nhigh, had not thrown out lava since the year 1718. Scarcely was any\r\nsmoke perceived to issue from it, when, in the month of May 1811,\r\nfrequent shocks announced that the volcanic fire was either\r\nrekindled, or directed anew to that part of the West Indies. The\r\nfirst eruption did not take place till the 27th of April, 1812, at\r\nnoon. It was merely an ejection of ashes, but attended with a\r\ntremendous noise. On the 30th, the lava overflowed the brink of the\r\ncrater, and, after a course of four hours, reached the sea. The\r\nsound of the explosion is described as resembling that of alternate\r\ndischarges of very large cannon and musketry; and it is worthy of\r\nremark, that it seemed much louder to persons out at sea, and at a\r\ngreat distance from land, than to those within sight of land, and\r\nnear the burning volcano.\r\n\r\nThe distance in a straight line from the volcano of St. Vincent to\r\nthe Rio Apure, near the mouth of the Nula, is two hundred and ten\r\nleagues.* (* Where the contrary is not expressly stated, nautical\r\nleagues of twenty to a degree, or two thousand eight hundred and\r\nfifty-five toises, are always to be understood.) The explosions\r\nwere consequently heard at a distance equal to that between\r\nVesuvius and Paris. This phenomenon, in conjunction with a great\r\nnumber of facts observed in the Cordilleras of the Andes, shows\r\nthat the sphere of the subterranean activity of a volcano is much\r\nmore extensive than we should be disposed to admit, if we judged\r\nmerely from the small changes effected at the surface of the globe.\r\nThe detonations heard during whole days together in the New World,\r\neighty, one hundred, or even two hundred leagues distant from a\r\ncrater, do not reach us by the propagation of the sound through the\r\nair; they are transmitted by the earth, perhaps in the very place\r\nwhere we happen to be. If the eruptions of the volcano of St.\r\nVincent, Cotopaxi, or Tunguragua, resounded from afar, like a\r\ncannon of immense magnitude, the noise ought to increase in the\r\ninverse ratio of the distance: but observations prove, that this\r\naugmentation does not take place. I must further observe, that M.\r\nBonpland and I, going from Guayaquil to the coast of Mexico,\r\ncrossed latitudes in the Pacific, where the crew of our ship were\r\ndismayed by a hollow sound coming from the depth of the ocean, and\r\ntransmitted by the waters. At that time a new eruption of Cotopaxi\r\ntook place, but we were as far distant from the volcano, as Etna\r\nfrom the city of Naples. The little town of Honda, on the banks of\r\nthe Magdalena, is not less than one hundred and forty-five leagues*\r\n(* This is the distance from Vesuvius to Mont Blanc.) from\r\nCotopaxi; and yet, in the great explosions of this volcano, in\r\n1744, a subterranean noise was heard at Honda, and supposed to be\r\ndischarges of heavy artillery. The monks of San Francisco spread a\r\nreport that the town of Carthagena was besieged and bombarded by\r\nthe English; and the intelligence was believed throughout the\r\ncountry. Now the volcano of Cotopaxi is a cone, more than one\r\nthousand eight hundred toises above the basin of Honda, and it\r\nrises from a table-land, the elevation of which is more than one\r\nthousand five hundred toises above the valley of the Magdalena. In\r\nall the colossal mountains of Quito, of the province of los Pastos,\r\nand of Popayan, crevices and valleys without number intervene. It\r\ncannot be admitted, under these circumstances, that the noise was\r\ntransmitted through the air, or over the surface of the globe, and\r\nthat it came from the point at which the cone and crater of\r\nCotapaxi are situated. It appears probable, that the more elevated\r\npart of the kingdom of Quito and the neighbouring Cordilleras, far\r\nfrom being a group of distinct volcanoes, constitute a single\r\nswollen mass, an enormous volcanic wall, stretching from south to\r\nnorth, and the crest of which presents a superficies of more than\r\nsix hundred square leagues. Cotopaxi, Tunguragua, Antisana, and\r\nPichincha, are on this same raised ground. They have different\r\nnames, but they are merely separate summits of the same volcanic\r\nmass. The fire issues sometimes from one, sometimes from another of\r\nthese summits. The obstructed craters appear to be extinguished\r\nvolcanoes; but we may presume, that, while Cotopaxi or Tunguragua\r\nhave only one or two eruptions in the course of a century, the fire\r\nis not less continually active under the town of Quito, under\r\nPichincha and Imbabura.\r\n\r\nAdvancing northward we find, between the volcano of Cotopaxi and\r\nthe town of Honda, two other systems of volcanic mountains, those\r\nof los Pastos and of Popayan. The connection between these systems\r\nwas manifested in the Andes by a phenomenon which I have already\r\nhad occasion to notice, in speaking of the last destruction of\r\nCumana. In the month of November 1796 a thick column of smoke began\r\nto issue from the volcano of Pasto, west of the town of that name,\r\nand near the valley of Rio Guaytara. The mouths of the volcano are\r\nlateral, and situated on its western declivity, yet during three\r\nsuccessive months the column of smoke rose so much higher than the\r\nridge of the mountain that it was constantly visible to the\r\ninhabitants of the town of Pasto. They described to us their\r\nastonishment when, on the 4th of February, 1797, they observed the\r\nsmoke disappear in an instant, whilst no shock whatever was felt.\r\nAt that very moment, sixty-five leagues southward, between\r\nChimborazo, Tunguragua, and the Altar (Capac-Urcu), the town of\r\nRiobamba was overthrown by the most terrible earthquake on record.\r\nIs it possible to doubt, from this coincidence of phenomena, that\r\nthe vapours issuing from the small apertures or ventanillas of the\r\nvolcano of Pasto had an influence on the pressure of those elastic\r\nfluids which convulsed the earth in the kingdom of Quito, and\r\ndestroyed in a few minutes thirty or forty thousand inhabitants?\r\n\r\nTo explain these great effects of volcanic reactions, and to prove\r\nthat the group or system of the volcanoes of the West India Islands\r\nmay sometimes shake the continent, I have cited the Cordillera of\r\nthe Andes. Geological reasoning can be supported only by the\r\nanalogy of facts which are recent, and consequently well\r\nauthenticated: and in what other region of the globe could we find\r\ngreater and more varied volcanic phenomena than in that double\r\nchain of mountains heaved up by fire? in that land where nature has\r\ncovered every mountain and every valley with her marvels? If we\r\nconsider a burning crater only as an isolated phenomenon, if we be\r\nsatisfied with merely examining the mass of stony substances which\r\nit has thrown up, the volcanic action at the surface of the globe\r\nwill appear neither very powerful nor very extensive. But the image\r\nof this action becomes enlarged in the mind when we study the\r\nrelations which link together volcanoes of the same group; for\r\ninstance, those of Naples and Sicily, of the Canary Islands,* of\r\nthe Azores, of the Caribbee islands of Mexico, of Guatimala, and of\r\nthe table-land of Quito; when we examine either the reactions of\r\nthese different systems of volcanoes on one another, or the\r\ndistance at which, by subterranean communication, they\r\nsimultaneously convulse the earth. (I have already observed\r\n(Chapter 1.2) that the whole group of the Canary Islands rises, as\r\nwe may say, above one and the same submarine volcano. Since the\r\nsixteenth century, the fire of this volcano has burst forth\r\nalternately in Palma, Teneriffe, and Lancerote. Auvergne presents a\r\nwhole system of volcanoes, the action of which has now ceased; but\r\nin the middle of a system of active volcanoes, for instance, in\r\nthat of Quito, we must not consider as an extinguished volcano a\r\nmountain, the crater of which is obstructed, and through which the\r\nsubterraneous fire has not issued for ages. Etna, the Aeolian\r\nIsles, Vesuvius, and Epomeo; the peak of Teyde, Palma, and\r\nLancerote; St. Michael, La Caldiera of Fayal, and Pico; St.\r\nVincent, St. Lucia, and Guadaloupe; Orizava, Popocatepetl, Jorullo,\r\nand La Colima; Bombacho, the volcano of Grenada, Telica, Momotombo,\r\nIsalco, and the volcano of Guatimala; Cotopaxi, Tunguragua,\r\nPichincha, Antisana, and Sangai, belong to the same system of\r\nburning volcanoes; they are generally ranged in rows, as if they\r\nhad issued from a crevice, or vein not filled up; and, it is very\r\nremarkable, that their position is in some parts in the general\r\ndirection of the Cordilleras, and in others in a contrary\r\ndirection.)\r\n\r\nThe study of volcanoes may be divided into two distinct branches;\r\none, simply mineralogical, is directed to the examination of the\r\nstony strata, altered or produced by the action of fire; from the\r\nformation of the trachytes or trap-porphyries, of basalts,\r\nphonolites, and dolerites, to the most recent lavas: the other\r\nbranch, less accessible and more neglected, comprehends the\r\nphysical relations which link volcanoes together, the influence of\r\none volcanic system on another, the connection existing between the\r\naction of burning mountains and the commotions which agitate the\r\nearth at great distances, and during long intervals, in the same\r\ndirection. This study cannot progress till the various epochs of\r\nsimultaneous action, the direction, the extent, and the force of\r\nthe convulsions are carefully noted; till we have attentively\r\nobserved their progressive advance to regions which they had not\r\npreviously reached; and the coincidence between distant volcanic\r\neruptions and those noises which the inhabitants of the Andes very\r\nexpressively term subterraneous thunders, or roarings.* (* Bramidos\r\ny truenos subterraneos.) All these objects are comprehended in the\r\ndomain of the history of nature.\r\n\r\nThough the narrow circle within which all certain traditions are\r\nconfined, does not present any of those general revolutions which\r\nhave heaved up the Cordilleras and buried myriads of pelagian\r\nanimals; yet Nature, acting under our eyes, nevertheless exhibits\r\nviolent though partial changes, the study of which may throw light\r\non the most remote epochs. In the interior of the earth those\r\nmysterious powers exist, the effects of which are manifested at the\r\nsurface by the production of vapours, of incandescent scoriae, of\r\nnew volcanic rocks and thermal springs, by the appearance of new\r\nislands and mountains, by commotions propagated with the rapidity\r\nof an electric shock, finally by those subterranean thunders,*\r\nheard during whole months, without shaking the earth, in regions\r\nfar distant from active volcanoes. (* In the town of Guanaxuato, in\r\nMexico, these thunders lasted from the 9th of January till the 12th\r\nof February, 1784. Guanaxuato is situated forty leagues north of\r\nthe volcano of Jorullo, and sixty leagues north west of the volcano\r\nof Popocatepetl. In places nearer these two volcanoes, three\r\nleagues distant from Guanaxuato, the subterranean thunders were not\r\nheard. The noise was circumscribed within a very narrow space, in\r\nthe region of a primitive schist, which approaches a\r\ntransition-schist, containing the richest silver mines of the known\r\nworld, and on which rest trap-porphyries, slates, and diabasis\r\n(grunstein.))\r\n\r\nIn proportion as equinoctial America shall increase in culture and\r\npopulation, and the system of volcanoes of the central table-land\r\nof Mexico, of the Caribbee Islands, of Popayan, of los Pastos, and\r\nQuito, shall be more attentively observed, the connection of\r\neruptions and of earthquakes, which precede and sometimes accompany\r\nthose eruptions, will be more generally recognized. The volcanoes\r\njust mentioned, particularly those of the Andes, which rise above\r\nthe enormous height of two thousand five hundred toises, present\r\ngreat advantages for observation. The periods of their eruptions\r\nare singularly regular. They remain thirty or forty years without\r\nemitting scoriae, ashes, or even vapours. I could not perceive the\r\nsmallest trace of smoke on the summit of Tunguragua or Cotopaxi. A\r\ngust of vapour issuing from the crater of Mount Vesuvius scarcely\r\nattracts the attention of the inhabitants of Naples, accustomed to\r\nthe movements of that little volcano, which throws out scoriae\r\nsometimes during two or three years successively. Thence it becomes\r\ndifficult to judge whether the emission of scoriae may have been\r\nmore frequent at the time when an earthquake has been felt in the\r\nApennines. On the ridge of the Cordilleras everything assumes a\r\nmore decided character. An eruption of ashes, which lasts only a\r\nfew minutes, is often followed by a calm of ten years. In such\r\ncircumstances it is easy to mark the periods, and to observe the\r\ncoincidence of phenomena.\r\n\r\nIf, as there appears to be little reason to doubt, that the\r\ndestruction of Cumana in 1797, and of Caracas in 1812, indicate the\r\ninfluence of the volcanoes of the West India Islands* on the\r\ncommotions felt on the coasts of Terra Firma, it may be desirable,\r\nbefore we close this chapter, to take a cursory view of this\r\nMediterranean archipelago.\r\n\r\n(* The following is the series of the phenomena:--\r\n\r\n27th of September, 1796. Eruption in the West India Islands.\r\n(Volcano of Guadaloupe).\r\n\r\nNovember, 1796. The volcano of Pasto began to emit smoke.\r\n\r\n14th of December, 1796. Destruction of Cumana.\r\n\r\n4th of February, 1797. Destruction of Riobamba.\r\n\r\n30th of January, 1811. Appearance of Sabrina Island, in the Azores.\r\nThe island enlarged very considerably on the 15th of June, 1811.\r\n\r\nMay, 1811. Commencement of the earthquakes in the island of St.\r\nVincent, which lasted till May 1812.\r\n\r\n16th of December, 1811. Commencement of the commotions in the\r\nvalley of the Mississippi and the Ohio, which lasted till 1813.\r\n\r\nDecember, 1811. Earthquake at Caracas.\r\n\r\n26th of March, 1811. Destruction of Caracas. Earthquakes, which\r\ncontinued till 1813.\r\n\r\n30th of April, 1811. Eruption of the volcano in St. Vincent; and\r\nthe same day subterranean noises at Caracas, and on the banks of\r\nthe Apure.)\r\n\r\nThe volcanic islands form one-fifth of that great arc extending\r\nfrom the coast of Paria to the peninsula of Florida. Running from\r\nsouth to north, they close the Caribbean Sea on the eastern side,\r\nwhile the greater West India Islands appear like the remains of a\r\ngroup of primitive mountains, the summit of which seems to have\r\nbeen between Cape Abacou, Point Morant, and the Copper Mountains,\r\nin that part where the islands of St. Domingo, Cuba, and Jamaica,\r\nare nearest to each other. Considering the basin of the Atlantic as\r\nan immense valley* which separates the two continents, and where,\r\nfrom 20 degrees south to 30 degrees north, the salient angles\r\n(Brazil and Senegambia) correspond to the receding angles (the gulf\r\nof Guinea and the Caribbean Sea), we are led to think that the\r\nlatter sea owes its formation to the action of currents, which,\r\nlike the current of rotation now existing, have flowed from east to\r\nwest; and have given the southern coast of Porto Rico, St. Domingo,\r\nand the island of Cuba their uniform configuration. (* The valley\r\nis narrowest (300 leagues) between Cape St. Roque and Sierra Leone.\r\nProceeding toward the north along the Coasts of the New Continent,\r\nfrom its pyramidal extremity, or the Straits of Magellan, we\r\nimagine we recognise the effects of a repulsion directed first\r\ntoward the north-east, then toward the north-west, and finally\r\nagain to the north-east.) This supposition of an oceanic irruption\r\nhas been the source of two other hypotheses on the origin of the\r\nsmaller West India Islands. Some geologists admit that the\r\nuninterrupted chain of islands from Trinidad to Florida exhibits\r\nthe remains of an ancient chain of mountains. They connect this\r\nchain sometimes with the granite of French Guiana, sometimes with\r\nthe calcareous mountains of Pari. Others, struck with the\r\ndifference of geological constitution between the primitive\r\nmountains of the Greater and the volcanic cones of the Lesser\r\nAntilles, consider the latter as having risen from the bottom of\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\nIf we recollect that volcanic upheavings, when they take place\r\nthrough elongated crevices, usually take a straight direction, we\r\nshall find it difficult to judge from the disposition of the\r\ncraters alone, whether the volcanoes have belonged to the same\r\nchain, or have always been isolated. Supposing an irruption of the\r\nocean to take place either into the eastern part of the island of\r\nJava* (* Raffles, History of Java, 1817, pages 23-28. The principal\r\nline of the volcanoes of Java, on a distance of 160 leagues, runs\r\nfrom west to east, through the mountains of Gagak, Gede,\r\nTankuban-Prahu, Ungarang Merapi, Lawu, Wilis, Arjuna, Dasar, and\r\nTashem.) or into the Cordilleras of Guatimala and Nicaragua, where\r\nso many burning mountains form but one chain, that chain would be\r\ndivided into several islands, and would perfectly resemble the\r\nCaribbean Archipelago. The union of primitive formations and\r\nvolcanic rocks in the same range of mountain is not extraordinary;\r\nit is very distinctly seen in my geological sections of the\r\nCordillera of the Andes. The trachytes and basalts of Popayan are\r\nseparated from the system of the volcanoes of Quito by the\r\nmica-slates of Almaguer; the volcanoes of Quito from the trachytes\r\nof Assuay by the gneiss of Condorasta and Guasunto. There does not\r\nexist a real chain of mountains running south-east and north-west\r\nfrom Oyapoc to the mouths of the Orinoco, and of which the smaller\r\nWest India Islands might be a northern prolongation. The granites\r\nof Guiana, as well as the hornblende-slates, which I saw near\r\nAngostura, on the banks of the Lower Orinoco, belong to the\r\nmountains of Pacaraimo and of Parime, stretching from west to east,\r\n* (From the cataracts of Atures towards the Essequibo River. This\r\nchain of Pacaraimo divides the waters of the Carony from those of\r\nthe Rio Parime, or Rio de Aguas Blancas.) in the interior of the\r\ncontinent, and not in a direction parallel with the coast, between\r\nthe mouths of the river Amazon and the Orinoco. But though we find\r\nno chain of mountains at the north-east extremity of Terra Firma,\r\nhaving the same direction as the archipelago of the smaller West\r\nIndia Islands, it does not therefore follow that the volcanic\r\nmountains of the archipelago may not have belonged originally to\r\nthe continent, and formed a part of the littoral chain of Caracas\r\nand Cumana.* (* Among many such examples which the structure of the\r\nglobe displays, we shall mention only the inflexion at a right\r\nangle formed by the Higher Alps towards the maritime Alps, in\r\nEurope; and the Belour-Tagh, which joins transversely the Mouz-Tagh\r\nand the Himalaya, in Asia. Amid the prejudices which impede the\r\nprogress of mineralogical geography, we may reckon, 1st, the\r\nsupposition of a perfect uniformity of direction in the chains of\r\nmountains; 2nd, the hypothesis of the continuity of all chains;\r\n3rd, the supposition that the highest summits determine the\r\ndirection of a central chain; 4th, the idea that, in all places\r\nwhere great rivers take rise, we may suppose the existence of great\r\ntablelands, or very high mountains.)\r\n\r\nIn opposing the objections of some celebrated naturalists, I am far\r\nfrom maintaining the ancient contiguity of all the smaller West\r\nIndia Islands. I am rather inclined to consider them as islands\r\nheaved up by fire, and ranged in that regular line, of which we\r\nfind striking examples in so many volcanic hills in Auvergne, in\r\nMexico, and in Peru. The geological constitution of the Archipelago\r\nappears, from the little we know respecting it, to be very similar\r\nto that of the Azores and the Canary Islands. Primitive formations\r\nare nowhere seen above ground; we find only what belongs\r\nunquestionably to volcanoes: feldspar-lava, dolerite, basalt,\r\nconglomerated scoriae, tufa, and pumice-stone. Among the limestone\r\nformations we must distinguish those which are essentially\r\nsubordinate to volcanic tufas* from those which appear to be the\r\nwork of madrepores and other zoophytes. (* We have noticed some of\r\nthe above, following Von Buch, at Lancerote, and at Fortaventura,\r\nin the system of the Canary Islands. Among the smaller islands of\r\nthe West Indies, the following islets are entirely calcareous,\r\naccording to M. Cortes: Mariegalante, La Desirade, the Grande Terre\r\nof Guadaloupe, and the Grenadillas. According to the observations\r\nof that naturalist, Curacoa and Buenos Ayres present only\r\ncalcareous formations. M. Cortes divides the West India Islands\r\ninto, 1st, those containing at once primitive, secondary, and\r\nvolcanic formations, like the greater islands; 2nd, those entirely\r\ncalcareous, (or at least so considered) as Mariegalante and\r\nCuracoa; 3rd, those at once volcanic and calcareous, as Antigua,\r\nSt. Bartholomew, St. Martin, and St. Thomas; 4th, those which have\r\nvolcanic rocks only, as St. Vincent, St. Lucia, and St. Eustache.)\r\nThe latter, according to M. Moreau de Jonnes, seem to lie on shoals\r\nof a volcanic nature. Those mountains, which present traces of the\r\naction of fire more or less recent, and some of which reach nearly\r\nnine hundred toises of elevation, are all situated on the western\r\nskirt of the smaller West India Islands.* (* Journal des Mines,\r\ntome 3 page 59. In order to exhibit in one point of view the whole\r\nsystem of the volcanoes of the smaller West India Islands, I will\r\nhere trace the direction of the islands from south to north.--Grenada,\r\nan ancient crater, filled with water; boiling springs;\r\nbasalts between St. George and Goave.--St. Vincent, a burning\r\nvolcano.--St. Lucia, a very active solfatara, named Oualibou, two\r\nor three hundred toises high; jets of hot water, by which small\r\nbasins are periodically filled.--Martinique, three great\r\nextinguished volcanoes; Vauclin, the Paps of Carbet, which are\r\nperhaps the most elevated summits of the smaller islands, and\r\nMontagne Pelee. (The height of this last mountain is probably 800\r\ntoises; according to Leblond it is 670 toises; according to\r\nDupuget, 736 toises. Between Vauclin and the feldspar-lavas of the\r\nPaps of Carbet is found, as M. Moreau de Jonnes asserts, in a neck\r\nof land, a region of early basalt called La Roche Carree). Thermal\r\nwaters of Precheur and Lameutin.--Dominica, completely\r\nvolcanic.--Guadaloupe, an active volcano, the height of which,\r\naccording to Leboucher, is 799 toises; according to Amie, 850\r\ntoises.--Montserrat, a solfatara; fine porphyritic lavas with large\r\ncrystals of feldspar and hornblende near Galloway, according to Mr.\r\nNugent.--Nevis, a solfatara.--St. Christopher's, a solfatara at\r\nMount Misery.--St. Eustache, a crater of an extinguished volcano,\r\nsurrounded by pumice-stone. (Trinidad, which is traversed by a\r\nchain of primitive slate, appears to have anciently formed a part\r\nof the littoral chain of Cumana, and not of the system of the\r\nmountains of the Caribbee Islands.)) Each island is not the effect\r\nof one single heaving-up: most of them appear to consist of\r\nisolated masses which have been progressively united together. The\r\nmatter has not been emitted from one crater, but from several; so\r\nthat a single island of small extent contains a whole system of\r\nvolcanoes, regions purely basaltic, and others covered with recent\r\nlavas. The volcanoes still burning are those of St. Vincent, St.\r\nLucia, and Guadaloupe. The first threw out lava in 1718 and 1812;\r\nin the second there is a continual formation of sulphur by the\r\ncondensation of vapours, which issue from the crevices of an\r\nancient crater. The last eruption of the volcano of Guadaloupe took\r\nplace in 1797. The Solfatara of St. Christopher's was still burning\r\nin 1692. At Martinique, Vauclin, Montagne Pelee, and the crater\r\nsurrounded by the five Paps of Carbet, must be considered as three\r\nextinguished volcanoes. The effects of thunder have been often\r\nconfounded in that place with subterranean fire. No good\r\nobservation has confirmed the supposed eruption of the 22nd of\r\nJanuary, 1792. The group of volcanoes in the Caribbee Islands\r\nresembles that of the volcanoes of Quito and Los Pastos; craters\r\nwith which the subterranean fire does not appear to communicate are\r\nranged on the same line with burning craters, and alternate with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the intimate connection manifested in the action of\r\nthe volcanoes of the smaller West India Islands and the earthquakes\r\nof Terra Firma, it often happens that shocks felt in the volcanic\r\narchipelago are not propagated to the island of Trinidad, or to the\r\ncoasts of Caracas and Cumana. This phenomenon is in no way\r\nsurprising: even in the Caribbees the commotions are often confined\r\nto one place. The great eruption of the volcano in St. Vincent's\r\ndid not occasion an earthquake at Martinique or Guadaloupe. Loud\r\nexplosions were heard there as well as at Venezuela, but the ground\r\nwas not convulsed.\r\n\r\nThese explosions must not be confounded with the rolling noise\r\nwhich everywhere precedes the slightest commotions; they are often\r\nheard on the banks of the Orinoco, and (as we were assured by\r\npersons living on the spot) between the Rio Arauca and Cuchivero.\r\nFather Morello relates that at the Mission of Cabruta the\r\nsubterranean noise so much resembles discharges of small cannon\r\n(pedreros) that it has seemed as if a battle were being fought at a\r\ndistance. On the 21st of October, 1766, the day of the terrible\r\nearthquake which desolated the province of New Andalusia, the\r\nground was simultaneously shaken at Cumana, at Caracas, at\r\nMaracaybo, and on the banks of the Casanare, the Meta, the Orinoco,\r\nand the Ventuario. Father Gili has described these commotions at\r\nthe Mission of Encaramada, a country entirely granitic, where they\r\nwere accompanied by loud explosions. Great fallings-in of the earth\r\ntook place in the mountain Paurari, and near the rock Aravacoto a\r\nsmall island disappeared in the Orinoco. The undulatory motion\r\ncontinued during a whole hour. This seemed the first signal of\r\nthose violent commotions which shook the coasts of Cumana and\r\nCariaco for more than ten months. It might be supposed that men\r\nliving in woods, with no other shelter than huts of reeds and\r\npalm-leaves, could have little to dread from earthquakes. But at\r\nErevato and Caura, where these phenomena are of rare occurrence,\r\nthey terrify the Indians, frighten the beasts of the forests, and\r\nimpel the crocodiles to quit the waters for the shore. Nearer the\r\nsea, where shocks are frequent, far from being dreaded by the\r\ninhabitants, they are regarded with satisfaction as the prognostics\r\nof a wet and fertile year.\r\n\r\nIn this dissertation on the earthquakes of Terra Firma and on the\r\nvolcanoes of the neighbouring archipelago of the West India\r\nIslands, I have pursued the plan of first relating a number of\r\nparticular facts, and then considering them in one general point of\r\nview. Everything announces in the interior of the globe the\r\noperation of active powers, which, by mutual reaction, balance and\r\nmodify one another. The greater our ignorance of the causes of\r\nthese undulatory movements, these evolutions of heat, these\r\nformations of elastic fluids, the more it becomes the duty of\r\npersons who apply themselves to the study of physical science to\r\nexamine the relations which these phenomena so uniformly present at\r\ngreat distances apart. It is only by considering these various\r\nrelations under a general point of view, and tracing them over a\r\ngreat extent of the surface of the globe, through formations of\r\nrocks the most different, that we are led to abandon the\r\nsupposition of trifling local causes, strata of pyrites, or of\r\nignited coal.* (* See \"Views of Nature\"--On the structure and\r\naction of volcanoes in different parts of the world, page 353\r\n(Bohn's edition); also \"Cosmos\" pages 199-225 (Bohn's edition).)\r\n\r\nThe following is the series of phenomena remarked on the northern\r\ncoasts of Cumana, Nueva Barcelona, and Caracas; and presumed to be\r\nconnected with the causes which produce earthquakes and eruptions\r\nof lava. We shall begin with the most eastern extremity, the island\r\nof Trinidad; which seems rather to belong to the shore of the\r\ncontinent than to the system of the mountains of the West India\r\nIslands.\r\n\r\n1. The pit which throws up asphaltum in the bay of Mayaro, on the\r\neastern coast of the island of Trinidad, southward of Point\r\nGuataro. This is the mine of chapapote or mineral tar of the\r\ncountry. I was assured that in the months of March and June the\r\neruptions are often attended with violent explosions, smoke, and\r\nflames. Almost on the same parallel, and also in the sea, but\r\nwestward of the island (near Punta de la Brea, and to the south of\r\nthe port of Naparaimo), we find a similar vent. On the neighbouring\r\ncoast, in a clayey ground, appears the celebrated lake of asphaltum\r\n(Laguna de la Brea), a marsh, the waters of which have the same\r\ntemperature as the atmosphere. The small cones situated at the\r\nsouth-western extremity of the island, between Point Icacos and the\r\nRio Erin, appear to have some analogy with the volcanoes of air and\r\nmud which I met with at Turbaco in the kingdom of New Grenada. I\r\nmention these situations of asphaltum on account of the remarkable\r\ncircumstances peculiar to them in these regions; for I am not\r\nunaware that naphtha, petroleum, and asphaltum are found equally in\r\nvolcanic and secondary regions,* and even more frequently in the\r\nlatter. (* The inflammable emanations of Pietra Mala, (consisting\r\nof hydrogen gas containing naphtha in a state of suspension) issue\r\nfrom the Alpine limestone, which may be traced from Covigliano to\r\nRaticofa, and which lies on ancient sandstone near Scarica l'Asino.\r\nUnder this sandstone (old red sandstone) we find black transition\r\nlimestone and the grauwack (quartzose psammite) of Florence.)\r\nPetroleum is found floating on the sea thirty leagues north of\r\nTrinidad, around the island of Grenada, which contains an\r\nextinguished crater and basalts.\r\n\r\n2. Hot Springs of Irapa, at the north-eastern extremity of New\r\nAndalusia, between Rio Caribe, Soro, and Yaguarapayo.\r\n\r\n3. Air-volcano, or Salce, of Cumacatar, to the south of San Jose\r\nand Carupano, near the northern coast of the continent, between La\r\nMontana de Paria and the town of Cariaco. Almost constant\r\nexplosions are felt in a clayey soil, which is affirmed to be\r\nimpregnated with sulphur. Hot sulphureous waters gush out with such\r\nviolence that the ground is agitated by very sensible shocks. It is\r\nsaid that flames have been frequently seen issuing out since the\r\ngreat earthquake of 1797. These facts are well worthy of being\r\nexamined.\r\n\r\n4. Petroleum-spring of the Buen Pastor, near Rio Areo. Large masses\r\nof sulphur have been found in clayey soils at Guayuta, as in the\r\nvalley of San Bonifacio, and near the junction of the Rio Pao with\r\nthe Orinoco.\r\n\r\n5. The Hot Waters (Aguas Calientes) south of the Rio Azul, and the\r\nHollow Ground of Cariaco, which, at the time of the great\r\nearthquake of Cumana, threw up sulphuretted water and viscous\r\npetroleum.\r\n\r\n6. Hot waters of the gulf of Cariaco.\r\n\r\n7. Petroleum-spring in the same gulf, near Maniquarez. It issues\r\nfrom mica-slate.\r\n\r\n8. Flames issuing from the earth, near Cumana, on the banks of the\r\nManzanares, and at Mariguitar, on the southern coast of the gulf of\r\nCariaco, at the time of the great earthquake of 1797.\r\n\r\n9. Igneous phenomena of the mountain of Cuchivano, near Cumanacoa.\r\n\r\n10. Petroleum-spring gushing from a shoal to the north of the\r\nCaracas Islands. The smell of this spring warns ships of the danger\r\nof this shoal, on which there is only one fathom of water.\r\n\r\n11. Thermal springs of the mountain of the Brigantine, near Nueva\r\nBarcelona. Temperature 43.2 degrees (centigrade).\r\n\r\n12. Thermal springs of Provisor, near San Diego, in the province of\r\nNew Barcelona.\r\n\r\n13. Thermal springs of Onoto, between Turmero and Maracay, in the\r\nvalleys of Aragua, west of Caracas.\r\n\r\n14. Thermal springs of Mariara, in the same valleys. Temperature\r\n58.9 degrees.\r\n\r\n15. Thermal springs of Las Trincheras, between Porto Cabello and\r\nValencia, issuing from granite like those of Mariara, and forming a\r\nriver of warm water (Rio de Aguas Calientes). Temperature 90.4\r\ndegrees.\r\n\r\n16. Boiling springs of the Sierra Nevada of Merida.\r\n\r\n17. Aperture of Mena, on the borders of Lake Maracaybo. It throws\r\nup asphaltum, and is said to emit gaseous emanations, which ignite\r\nspontaneously, and are seen at a great distance.\r\n\r\nThese are the springs of petroleum and of thermal waters, the\r\nigneous meteors, and the ejections of muddy substances attended\r\nwith explosions, of which I acquired a knowledge in the vast\r\nprovinces of Venezuela, whilst travelling over a space of two\r\nhundred leagues from east to west. These various phenomena have\r\noccasioned great excitement among the inhabitants since the\r\ncatastrophes of 1797 and 1812: yet they present nothing which\r\nconstitutes a volcano, in the sense hitherto attributed to that\r\nword. If the apertures, which throw up vapours and water with\r\nviolent noise, be sometimes called volcancitos, it is only by such\r\nof the inhabitants as persuade themselves that volcanoes must\r\nnecessarily exist in countries so frequently exposed to\r\nearthquakes. Advancing from the burning crater of St. Vincent in\r\nthe directions of south, west and south-west, first by the chain of\r\nthe Caribbee Islands, then by the littoral chain of Cumana and\r\nVenezuela, and finally by the Cordilleras of New Grenada, along a\r\ndistance of three hundred and eighty leagues, we find no active\r\nvolcano before we arrive at Purace, near Popayan. The total absence\r\nof apertures, through which melted substances can issue, in that\r\npart of the continent, which stretches eastward of the Cordillera\r\nof the Andes, and eastward of the Rocky Mountains, is a most\r\nremarkable geological fact.\r\n\r\nIn this chapter we have examined the great commotions which from\r\ntime to time convulse the stony crust of the globe, and scatter\r\ndesolation in regions favoured by the most precious gifts of\r\nnature. An uninterrupted calm prevails in the upper atmosphere;\r\nbut, to use an expression of Franklin, more ingenious than\r\naccurate, thunder often rolls in the subterranean atmosphere,\r\namidst that mixture of elastic fluids, the impetuous movements of\r\nwhich are frequently felt at the surface of the earth. The\r\ndestruction of so many populous cities presents a picture of the\r\ngreatest calamities which afflict mankind. A people struggling for\r\nindependence are suddenly exposed to the want of subsistence, and\r\nof all the necessaries of life. Famished and without shelter, the\r\ninhabitants are dispersed through the country, and numbers who have\r\nescaped from the ruin of their dwellings are swept away by disease.\r\nFar from strengthening mutual confidence among the citizens, the\r\nfeeling of misfortune destroys it; physical calamities augment\r\ncivil discord; nor does the aspect of a country bathed in tears and\r\nblood appease the fury of the victorious party.\r\n\r\nAfter the recital of so many calamities, the mind is soothed by\r\nturning to consolatory remembrances. When the great catastrophe of\r\nCaracas was known in the United States, the Congress, assembled at\r\nWashington, unanimously decreed that five ships laden with flour\r\nshould be sent to the coast of Venezuela; their cargoes to be\r\ndistributed among the most needy of the inhabitants. The generous\r\ncontribution was received with the warmest gratitude; and this\r\nsolemn act of a free people, this mark of national interest, of\r\nwhich the advanced civilization of the Old World affords but few\r\nexamples, seemed to be a valuable pledge of the mutual sympathy\r\nwhich ought for ever to unite the nations of North and South\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.15.\r\n\r\nDEPARTURE FROM CARACAS.\r\nMOUNTAINS OF SAN PEDRO AND OF LOS TEQUES.\r\nLA VICTORIA.\r\nVALLEYS OF ARAGUA.\r\n\r\nTo take the shortest road from Caracas to the banks of the Orinoco,\r\nwe should have crossed the southern chain of mountains between\r\nBaruta, Salamanca, and the savannahs of Ocumare, passed over the\r\nsteppes or llanos of Orituco, and embarked at Cabruta, near the\r\nmouth of the Rio Guarico. But this direct route would have deprived\r\nus of the opportunity of surveying the valleys of Aragua, which are\r\nthe finest and most cultivated portion of the province; of taking\r\nthe level of an important part of the chain of the coast by means\r\nof the barometer; and of descending the Rio Apure as far as its\r\njunction with the Orinoco. A traveller who has the intention of\r\nstudying the configuration and natural productions of a country is\r\nnot guided by distances, but by the peculiar interest attached to\r\nthe regions he may traverse. This powerful motive led us to the\r\nmountains of Los Teques, to the hot springs of Mariara, to the\r\nfertile banks of the lake of Valencia, and through the immense\r\nsavannahs of Calabozo to San Fernando de Apure, in the eastern part\r\nof the province of Varinas. Having determined on this route, our\r\nfirst direction was westward, then southward, and finally to\r\neast-south-east, so that we might enter the Orinoco by the Apure in\r\nlatitude 7 degrees 36 minutes 23 seconds.\r\n\r\nOn the day on which we quitted the capital of Venezuela, we reached\r\nthe foot of the woody mountains which close the valley on the\r\nsouth-west. There we halted for the night, and on the following day\r\nwe proceeded along the right bank of the Rio Guayra as far as the\r\nvillage of Antimano, by a very fine road, partly scooped out of the\r\nrock. We passed by La Vega and Carapa. The church of La Vega rises\r\nvery picturesquely above a range of hills covered with thick\r\nvegetation. Scattered houses surrounded with date-trees seem to\r\ndenote the comfort of their inhabitants. A chain of low mountains\r\nseparates the little river Guayra from the valley of La Pascua* (so\r\ncelebrated in the history of the country) (* Valley of Cortes, or\r\nEaster Valley, so called because Diego de Losada, after having\r\ndefeated the Teques Indians, and their cacique Guaycaypuro, in the\r\nmountains of San Pedro, spent the Easter there in 1567, before\r\nentering the valley of San Francisco. In the latter place he\r\nfounded the city of Caracas.), and from the ancient gold-mines of\r\nBaruta and Oripoto. Ascending in the direction of Carapa, we enjoy\r\nonce more the sight of the Silla, which appears like an immense\r\ndome with a cliff on the side next the sea. This rounded summit,\r\nand the ridge of Galipano crenated like a wall, are the only\r\nobjects which in this basin of gneiss and mica-slate impress a\r\npeculiar character on the landscape. The other mountains have a\r\nuniform and monotonous aspect.\r\n\r\nA little before reaching the village of Antimano we observed on the\r\nright a very curious geological phenomenon. In hollowing the new\r\nroad out of the rock, two large veins of gneiss were discovered in\r\nthe mica-slate. They are nearly perpendicular, intersecting all the\r\nmica-slate strata, and are from six to eight toises thick. These\r\nveins contain not fragments, but balls or spheres of granular\r\ndiabasis,* formed of concentric layers. (* Ur-grunstein. I remember\r\nhaving seen similar balls filling a vein in transition-slate, near\r\nthe castle of Schauenstein in the margravate of Bayreuth. I sent\r\nseveral balls from Antimano to the collection of the king of Spain\r\nat Madrid.) These balls are composed of lamellar feldspar and\r\nhornblende closely commingled. The feldspar approximates sometimes\r\nto vitreous feldspar when disseminated in very thin laminae in a\r\nmass of granular diabasis, decomposed, and emitting a strong\r\nargillaceous smell. The diameter of the spheres is very unequal,\r\nsometimes four or eight inches, sometimes three or four feet; their\r\nnucleus, which is more dense, is without concentric layers, and of\r\na very dark green hue, inclining to black. I could not perceive any\r\nmica in them; but, what is very remarkable, I found great\r\nquantities of disseminated garnets. These garnets are of a very\r\nfine red, and are found in the grunstein only. They are neither in\r\nthe gneiss, which serves as a cement to the balls, nor in the\r\nmica-slate, which the veins traverse. The gneiss, the constituent\r\nparts of which are in a state of considerable disintegration,\r\ncontains large crystals of feldspar; and, though it forms the body\r\nof the vein in the mica-slate, it is itself traversed by threads of\r\nquartz two inches thick, and of very recent formation. The aspect\r\nof this phenomenon is very curious: it appears as if cannon-balls\r\nwere embedded in a wall of rock. I also thought I recognized in\r\nthese same regions, in the Montana de Avila, and at Cabo Blanco,\r\neast of La Guayra, a granular diabasis, mixed with a small quantity\r\nof quartz and pyrites, and destitute of garnets, not in veins, but\r\nin subordinate strata in the mica-slate. This position is\r\nunquestionably to be found in Europe in primitive mountains; but in\r\ngeneral the granular diabasis is more frequently connected with the\r\nsystem of transition rocks, especially with a schist\r\n(ubergangs-thonschiefer) abounding in beds of Lydian stone strongly\r\ncarburetted, of schistose jasper,* (Kieselschiefer.) ampelites,*\r\n(Alaunschiefer.) and black limestone.\r\n\r\nNear Antimano all the orchards were full of peach-trees loaded with\r\nblossom. This village, the Valle, and the banks of the Macarao,\r\nfurnish great abundance of peaches, quinces, and other European\r\nfruits for the market of Caracas. Between Antimano and Ajuntas we\r\ncrossed the Rio Guayra seventeen times. The road is very fatiguing;\r\nyet, instead of making a new one, it would perhaps be better to\r\nchange the bed of the river, which loses a great quantity of water\r\nby the combined effects of filtration and evaporation. Each\r\nsinuosity forms a marsh more or less extensive. This loss of water\r\nis to be regretted in a province, nearly all the cultivated\r\nportions of which are extremely dry. The rains are much less\r\nfrequent and less violent in this place than in the interior of New\r\nAndalusia, at Cumanacoa, and on the banks of the Guarapiche. Many\r\nof the mountains of Caracas enter the region of the clouds; but the\r\nstrata of primitive rocks dip at an angle of 70 or 80 degrees, and\r\ngenerally to northwest, so that the waters are either lost in the\r\ninterior of the earth, or gush out in copious springs not southward\r\nbut northward of the mountains of the coast of Niguatar, Avila, and\r\nMariara. The rising of the gneiss and mica-slate strata to the\r\nsouth appears to me to explain in a considerable degree the extreme\r\nhumidity of the coast. In the interior of the province we meet with\r\nportions of land, two or three leagues square, in which there are\r\nno springs; consequently sugar-cane, indigo, and coffee, grow only\r\nin places where running waters can be made to supply artificial\r\nirrigation during very dry weather. The early colonists imprudently\r\ndestroyed the forests. Evaporation is enormous on a stony soil\r\nsurrounded with rocks, which radiate heat on every side. The\r\nmountains of the coast, like a wall, extending east and west from\r\nCape Codera toward Point Tucacas, prevent the humid air of the\r\nshore (that is to say, those inferior strata of the atmosphere\r\nresting immediately on the sea, and dissolving the largest\r\nproportion of water) from penetrating to the islands. There are few\r\nopenings, few ravines, which, like those of Catia or of Tipe, lead\r\nfrom the coast to the high longitudinal valleys, and there is no\r\nbed of a great river, no gulf allowing the sea to flow inland,\r\nspreading moisture by abundant evaporation. In the eighth and tenth\r\ndegrees of latitude, in regions where the clouds do not, as it\r\nwere, skim the surface of the soil, many trees are stripped of\r\ntheir leaves in the months of January and February; not by the\r\nsinking of the temperature as in Europe, but because the air at\r\nthis period, the most distant from the rainy season, nearly attains\r\nits maximum of dryness. Only those plants which have very tough and\r\nglossy leaves resist this absence of humidity. Beneath the fine sky\r\nof the tropics the traveller is struck with the almost hibernal\r\naspect of the country; but the freshest verdure again appears when\r\nhe reaches the banks of the Orinoco, where another climate\r\nprevails; and the great forests preserve by their shade a certain\r\nquantity of moisture in the soil, by sheltering it from the\r\ndevouring heat of the sun.\r\n\r\nBeyond the small village of Antimano the valley becomes much\r\nnarrower. The river is bordered with Lata, a fine gramineous plant\r\nwith distich leaves, which sometimes reaches the height of thirty\r\nfeet.* (* G. saccharoides.) Every hut is surrounded with enormous\r\ntrees of persea,* (* Laurus persea (alligator pear).) at the foot\r\nof which the aristolochiae, paullinia, and other creepers vegetate.\r\nThe neighbouring mountains, covered with forests, seem to spread\r\nhumidity over the western extremity of the valley of Caracas. We\r\npassed the night before our arrival at Las Ajuntas at a sugar-cane\r\nplantation. A square house (the hacienda or farm of Don Fernando\r\nKey-Munoz) contained nearly eighty negroes; they were lying on\r\nskins of oxen spread upon the ground. In each apartment of the\r\nhouse were four slaves: it looked like a barrack. A dozen fires\r\nwere burning in the farm-yard, where people were employed in\r\ndressing food, and the noisy mirth of the blacks almost prevented\r\nus from sleeping. The clouds hindered me from observing the stars;\r\nthe moon appeared only at intervals. The aspect of the landscape\r\nwas dull and uniform, and all the surrounding hills were covered\r\nwith aloes. Workmen were employed at a small canal, intended for\r\nconveying the waters of the Rio San Pedro to the farm, at a height\r\nof more than seventy feet. According to a barometric calculation,\r\nthe site of the hacienda is only fifty toises above the bed of the\r\nRio Guayra at La Noria, near Caracas.\r\n\r\nThe soil of these countries is found to be but little favourable to\r\nthe cultivation of the coffee-tree, which in general is less\r\nproductive in the valley of Caracas than was imagined when the\r\nfirst plantations were made near Chacao. The finest\r\ncoffee-plantations are now found in the savannah of Ocumare, near\r\nSalamanca, and at Rincon, in the mountainous countries of Los\r\nMariches, San Antonio Hatillo, and Los Budares. The coffee of the\r\nthree last mentioned places, situated eastward of Caracas, is of a\r\nsuperior quality; but the trees bear a smaller quantity, which is\r\nattributed to the height of the spot and the coolness of the\r\nclimate. The greater plantations of the province of Venezuela (as\r\nAguacates, near Valencia and Rincon) yield in good years a produce\r\nof three thousand quintals.\r\n\r\nThe extreme predilection entertained in this province for the\r\nculture of the coffee-tree is partly founded on the circumstance\r\nthat the berry can be preserved during a great number of years;\r\nwhereas, notwithstanding every possible care, cacao spoils in the\r\nwarehouses after ten or twelve months. During the long dissensions\r\nof the European powers, at a time when Spain was too weak to\r\nprotect the commerce of her colonies, industry was directed in\r\npreference to productions of which the sale was less urgent, and\r\ncould await the chances of political and commercial events. I\r\nremarked that in the coffee-plantations the nurseries are formed\r\nnot so much by collecting together young plants, accidentally\r\nrising under trees which have yielded a crop, as by exposing the\r\nseeds of coffee to germination during five days, in heaps, between\r\nplantain leaves. These seeds are taken out of the pulp, but yet\r\nretaining a part of it adherent to them. When the seed has\r\ngerminated it is sown, and it produces plants capable of bearing\r\nthe heat of the sun better than those which spring up in the shade\r\nin coffee-plantations. In this country five thousand three hundred\r\ncoffee-trees are generally planted in a fanega of ground, amounting\r\nto five thousand four hundred and seventy-six square toises. This\r\nland, if it be capable of artificial irrigation, costs five hundred\r\npiastres in the northern part of the province. The coffee-tree\r\nflowers only in the second year, and its flowering lasts only\r\ntwenty-four hours. At this time the shrub has a charming\r\nappearance; and, when seen from afar, it appears covered with snow.\r\nThe produce of the third year becomes very abundant. In plantations\r\nwell weeded and watered, and recently cultivated, trees will bear\r\nsixteen, eighteen, and even twenty pounds of coffee. In general,\r\nhowever, more than a pound and a half or two pounds cannot be\r\nexpected from each plant; and even this is superior to the mean\r\nproduce of the West India Islands. The coffee trees suffer much\r\nfrom rain at the time of flowering, as well as from the want of\r\nwater for artificial irrigation, and also from a parasitic plant, a\r\nnew species of loranthus, which clings to the branches. When, in\r\nplantations of eighty or a hundred thousand shrubs, we consider the\r\nimmense quantity of organic matter contained in the pulpy berry of\r\nthe coffee-tree, we may be astonished that no attempts have been\r\nmade to extract a spirituous liquor from them.* (* The berries\r\nheaped together produce a vinous fermentation, during which a very\r\npleasant alcoholic smell is emitted. Placing, at Caracas, the ripe\r\nfruit of the coffee-tree under an inverted jar, quite filled with\r\nwater, and exposed to the rays of the sun, I remarked that no\r\nextrication of gas took place in the first twenty-four hours. After\r\nthirty-six hours the berries became brown, and yielded gas. A\r\nthermometer, enclosed in the jar in contact with the fruit, kept at\r\nnight 4 or 5 degrees higher than the external air. In the space of\r\neighty-seven hours, sixty berries, under various jars, yielded me\r\nfrom thirty-eight to forty cubic inches of a gas, which underwent\r\nno sensible diminution with nitrous gas. Though a great quantity of\r\ncarbonic acid had been absorbed by the water as it was produced, I\r\nstill found 0.78 in the forty inches. The remainder, or 0.22, was\r\nnitrogen. The carbonic acid had not been formed by the absorption\r\nof the atmospheric oxygen. That which is evolved from the berries\r\nof the coffee-tree slightly moistened, and placed in a phial with a\r\nglass stopple filled with air, contains alcohol in suspension; like\r\nthe foul air which is formed in our cellars during the fermentation\r\nof must. On agitating the gas in contact with water, the latter\r\nacquires a decidedly alcoholic flavour. How many substances are\r\nperhaps contained in a state of suspension in those mixtures of\r\ncarbonic acid and hydrogen, which are called deleterious miasmata,\r\nand which rise everywhere within the tropics, in marshy grounds, on\r\nthe sea-shore, and in forests where the soil is strewed with dead\r\nleaves, rotten fruits, and putrefying insects.)\r\n\r\nIf the troubles of St. Domingo, the temporary rise in the price of\r\ncolonial produce, and the emigration of French planters, were the\r\nfirst causes of the establishment of coffee plantations on the\r\ncontinent of America, in the island of Cuba, and in Jamaica; their\r\nproduce has far more than compensated the deficiency of the\r\nexportation from the French West India Islands. This produce has\r\naugmented in proportion to the population, the change of customs,\r\nand the increasing luxury of the nations of Europe. The island of\r\nSt. Domingo exported, in 1700, at the time of Necker's\r\nadministration, nearly seventy-six million pounds of coffee.* (*\r\nFrench pounds, containing 9216 grains. 112 English pounds = 105\r\nFrench pounds; and 160 Spanish pounds = 93 French pounds. The\r\nisland of St. Domingo was at that time, it must be remembered, a\r\nFrench colony.)\r\n\r\nTea could be cultivated as well as coffee in the mountainous parts\r\nof the provinces of Caracas and Cumana. Every climate is there\r\nfound rising in stages one above another; and this new culture\r\nwould succeed there as well as in the southern hemisphere, where\r\nthe government of Brazil, protecting at the same time industry and\r\nreligious toleration, suffered at once the introduction of Chinese\r\ntea and of the dogmas of Fo. It is not yet a century since the\r\nfirst coffee-trees were planted at Surinam and in the West India\r\nIslands, and already the produce of America amounts to fifteen\r\nmillions of piastres, reckoning the quintal of coffee at fourteen\r\npiastres only.\r\n\r\nOn the eighth of February we set out at sunrise, to cross the\r\nHiguerote, a group of lofty mountains, separating the two\r\nlongitudinal valleys of Caracas and Aragua. After passing, near Las\r\nAjuntas, the junction of the two small rivers San Pedro and\r\nMacarao, which form the Rio Guayra, we ascended a steep hill to the\r\ntable-land of La Buenavista, where we saw a few lonely houses. The\r\nview extends on the north-west to the city of Caracas, and on the\r\nsouth to the village of Los Teques. The country has a very wild\r\naspect, and is thickly wooded. We had now gradually lost the plants\r\nof the valley of Caracas.* (* The Flora of Caracas is characterized\r\nchiefly by the following plants, which grow between the heights of\r\nfour hundred and six hundred toises. Cipura martinicensis, Panicum\r\nmieranthum, Parthenium hysterophorus, Vernonia odoratissima,\r\n(Pevetera, with flowers having a delicious odour of heliotropium),\r\nTagetes caracasana, T. scoparia of Lagasca (introduced by M.\r\nBonpland into the gardens of Spain), Croton hispidus, Smilax\r\nscabriusculus, Limnocharis Humboldti, Rich., Equisetum\r\nramosissimum, Heteranthera alismoides, Glycine punctata, Hyptis\r\nPlumeri, Pavonia cancellata, Cav., Spermacoce rigida, Crotalaria\r\nacutifolia, Polygala nemorosa, Stachytarpheta mutabilis,\r\nCardiospermum ulmaceum, Amaranthus caracasanus, Elephantopus\r\nstrigosus, Hydrolea mollis, Alternanthera caracasana, Eupatorium\r\namydalinum, Elytraria fasciculata, Salvia fimbriata, Angelonia\r\nsalicaria, Heliotropium strictum, Convolvulus batarilla, Rubus\r\njamaicensis, Datura arborea, Dalea enneaphylla, Buchnera rosea,\r\nSalix Humboldtiana, Willd., Theophrasta longifolia, Tournefortia\r\ncaracasana, Inga cinerea, I. ligustrina, I. sapindioides, I.\r\nfastuosa, Schwenkia patens, Erythrina mitis. The most agreeable\r\nplaces for herborizing near Caracas are the ravines of Tacagua,\r\nTipe, Cotecita, Catoche, Anauco, and Chacaito.) We were eight\r\nhundred and thirty-five toises above the level of the ocean, which\r\nis almost the height of Popayan; but the mean temperature of this\r\nplace is probably only 17 or 18 degrees. The road over these\r\nmountains is much frequented; we met continually long files of\r\nmules and oxen; it is the great road leading from the capital to La\r\nVictoria, and the valleys of Aragua. This road is cut out of a\r\ntalcose gneiss* in a state of decomposition. (* The direction of\r\nthe strata of gneiss varies; it is either hor. 3.4, dipping to the\r\nnorth-west or hor. 8.2, dipping to the south-east.) A clayey soil\r\nmixed with spangles of mica covered the rock, to the depth of three\r\nfeet. Travellers suffer from the dust in winter, while in the rainy\r\nseason the place is changed into a slough. On descending the\r\ntable-land of Buenavista, about fifty toises to the south-east, an\r\nabundant spring, gushing from the gneiss, forms several cascades\r\nsurrounded with thick vegetation. The path leading to the spring is\r\nso steep that we could touch with our hands the tops of the\r\narborescent ferns, the trunks of which reach a height of more than\r\ntwenty-five feet. The surrounding rocks are covered with\r\njungermannias and hypnoid mosses. The torrent, formed by the\r\nspring, and shaded with heliconias, uncovers, as it falls, the\r\nroots of the plumerias,* (* The red jasmine-tree, frangipanier of\r\nthe French West India Islands. The plumeria, so common in the\r\ngardens of the Indians, has been very seldom found in a wild state.\r\nIt is mixed here with the Piper flagellare, the spadix of which\r\nsometimes reaches three feet long. With the new kind of fig-tree\r\n(which we have called Ficus gigantea, because it frequently attains\r\nthe height of a hundred feet), we find in the mountains of\r\nBuenavista and of Los Teques, the Ficus nymphaeifolia of the garden\r\nof Schonbrunn, introduced into our hot-houses by M. Bredemeyer. I\r\nam certain of the identity of the species found in the same places;\r\nbut I doubt really whether it be really the F. nymphaeifolia of\r\nLinnaeus, which is supposed to be a native of the East Indies.)\r\ncupeys,* (* In the experiments I made at Caracas, on the air which\r\ncirculates in plants, I was struck with the fine appearance\r\npresented by the petioles and leaves of the Clusia rosea, when cut\r\nopen under water, and exposed to the rays of the sun. Each trachea\r\ngives out a current of gas, purer by 0.08 than atmospheric air. The\r\nphenomenon ceases the moment the apparatus is placed in the shade.\r\nThere is only a very slight disengagement of air at the two\r\nsurfaces of the leaves of the clusia exposed to the sun without\r\nbeing cut open. The gas enclosed in the capsules of the\r\nCardiospermum vesicarium appeared to me to contain the same\r\nproportion of oxygen as the atmosphere, while that contained\r\nbetween the knots, in the hollow of the stalk, is generally less\r\npure, containing only from 0.12 to 0.15 of oxygen. It is necessary\r\nto distinguish between the air circulating in the tracheae, and\r\nthat which is stagnant in the great cavities of the stems and\r\npericarps.) browneas, and Ficus gigantea. This humid spot, though\r\ninfested by serpents, presents a rich harvest to the botanist. The\r\nBrownea, which the inhabitants call rosa del monte, or palo de\r\ncruz, bears four or five hundred purple flowers together in one\r\nthyrsus; each flower has invariably eleven stamina, and this\r\nmajestic plant, the trunk of which grows to the height of fifty or\r\nsixty feet, is becoming rare, because its wood yields a highly\r\nvalued charcoal. The soil is covered with pines (ananas),\r\nhemimeris, polygala, and melastomas. A climbing gramen* (* Carice.\r\nSee Chapter 6.) with its light festoons unites trees, the presence\r\nof which attests the coolness of the climate of these mountains.\r\nSuch are the Aralia capitata,* (* Candelero. We found it also at La\r\nCumbre, at a height of 700 toises.) the Vismia caparosa, and the\r\nClethra fagifolia. Among these plants, peculiar to the fine region\r\nof the arborescent ferns,* (* Called by the inhabitants of the\r\ncountry Region de los helechos.) some palm-trees rise in the\r\nopenings, and some scattered groups of guarumo, or cecropia with\r\nsilvery leaves. The trunks of the latter are not very thick, and\r\nare of a black colour towards the summit, as if burnt by the oxygen\r\nof the atmosphere. We are surprised to find so noble a tree, which\r\nhas the port of the theophrasta and the palm-tree, bearing\r\ngenerally only eight or ten terminal leaves. The ants, which\r\ninhabit the trunk of the guarumo, or jarumo, and destroy its\r\ninterior cells, seem to impede its growth. We had already made one\r\nherborization in the temperate mountains of the Higuerote in the\r\nmonth of December, accompanying the capitan-general, Senor de\r\nGuevara, in an excursion with the intendant of the province to the\r\nValles de Aragua. M. Bonpland then found in the thickest part of\r\nthe forest some plants of aguatire, the wood of which, celebrated\r\nfor its fine red colour, will probably one day become an article of\r\nexportation to Europe. It is the Sickingia erythroxylon described\r\nby Bredemeyer and Willdenouw.\r\n\r\nDescending the woody mountain of the Higuerote to the south-west,\r\nwe reached the small village of San Pedro, situated in a basin\r\nwhere several valleys meet, and almost three hundred toises lower\r\nthan the table-land of Buenavista. Plantain-trees, potatoes,* (*\r\nSolanum tuberosum.) and coffee are cultivated together on this\r\nspot. The village is very small, and the church not yet finished.\r\nWe met at an inn (pulperia) several European Spaniards employed at\r\nthe government tobacco farm. Their dissatisfaction formed a strange\r\ncontrast to our feelings. They were fatigued with their journey,\r\nand they vented their displeasure in complaints and maledictions on\r\nthe wretched country, or to use their own phrase, estas tierras\r\ninfelices, in which they were doomed to live. We, on the other\r\nhand, were enchanted with the wild scenery, the fertility of the\r\nsoil, and the mildness of the climate. Near San Pedro, the talcose\r\ngneiss of Buenavista passes into a mica-slate filled with garnets,\r\nand containing subordinate beds of serpentine. Something analogous\r\nto this is met with at Zoblitz in Saxony. The serpentine, which is\r\nvery pure and of a fine green, varied with spots of a lighter tint,\r\noften appears only superimposed on the mica-slate. I found in it a\r\nfew garnets, but no metaloid diallage.\r\n\r\nThe valley of San Pedro, through which flows the river of the same\r\nname, separates two great masses of mountains, the Higuerote and\r\nLas Cocuyzas. We ascended westward in the direction of the small\r\nfarms of Las Lagunetos and Garavatos. These are solitary houses,\r\nwhich serve as inns, and where the mule-drivers obtain their\r\nfavourite beverage, the guarapo, or fermented juice of the\r\nsugar-cane: intoxication is very common among the Indians who\r\nfrequent this road. Near Garavatos there is a mica-slate rock of\r\nsingular form; it is a ridge, or steep wall, crowned by a tower. We\r\nopened the barometer at the highest point of the mountain Las\r\nCocuyzas,* (* Absolute height 845 toises.) and found ourselves\r\nalmost at the same elevation as on the table-land of Buenavista,\r\nwhich is scarcely ten toises higher.\r\n\r\nThe prospect at Las Lagunetas is extensive, but rather uniform.\r\nThis mountainous and uncultivated tract of ground between the\r\nsources of the Guayra and the Tuy is more than twenty-five square\r\nleagues in extent. We there found only one miserable village, that\r\nof Los Teques, south-east of San Pedro. The soil is as it were\r\nfurrowed by a multitude of valleys, the smallest of which, parallel\r\nwith each other, terminate at right angles in the largest valleys.\r\nThe back of the mountains presents an aspect as monotonous as the\r\nravines; it has no pyramidal forms, no ridges, no steep\r\ndeclivities. I am inclined to think that the undulation of this\r\nground, which is for the most part very gentle, is less owing to\r\nthe nature of the rocks, (to the decomposition of the gneiss for\r\ninstance), than to the long presence of the water and the action of\r\ncurrents. The limestone mountains of Cumana present the same\r\nphenomenon north of Tumiriquiri.\r\n\r\nFrom Las Lagunetas we descended into the valley of the Rio Tuy.\r\nThis western slope of the mountains of Los Teques bears the name of\r\nLas Cocuyzas, and it is covered with two plants with agave leaves;\r\nthe maguey of Cocuyza, and the maquey of Cocuy. The latter belongs\r\nto the genus Yucca.* (* Yucca acaulis, Humb.) Its sweet and\r\nfermented juice yields a spirit by distillation; and I have seen\r\nthe young leaves of this plant eaten. The fibres of the full-grown\r\nleaves furnish cords of extraordinary strength.* (* At the clock of\r\nthe cathedral of Caracas, a cord of maguey, half an inch in\r\ndiameter, sustained for fifteen years a weight of 350 pounds.)\r\nLeaving the mountains of the Higuerote and Los Teques, we entered a\r\nhighly cultivated country, covered with hamlets and villages;\r\nseveral of which would in Europe be called towns. From east to\r\nwest, on a line of twelve leagues in extent, we passed La Victoria,\r\nSan Mateo, Turmero, and Maracay, containing together more than 28,\r\n000 inhabitants. The plains of the Tuy may be considered as the\r\neastern extremity of the valleys of Aragua, extending from Guigne,\r\non the borders of the lake of Valencia, as far as the foot of Las\r\nCocuyzas. A barometrical measurement gave me 295 toises for the\r\nabsolute height of the Valle del Tuy, near the farm of Manterola,\r\nand 222 toises for that of the surface of the lake. The Rio Tuy,\r\nflowing from the mountains of Las Cocuyzas, runs first towards the\r\nwest, then turning to the south and to the east, it takes its\r\ncourse along the high savannahs of Ocumare, receives the waters of\r\nthe valley of Caracas, and reaches the sea near cape Codera. It is\r\nthe small portion of its basin in the westward direction which,\r\ngeologically speaking, would seem to belong to the valley of\r\nAragua, if the hills of calcareous tufa, breaking the continuity of\r\nthese valleys between Consejo and La Victoria, did not deserve some\r\nconsideration. We shall here again remind the reader that the group\r\nof the mountains of Los Teques, eight hundred and fifty toises\r\nhigh, separates two longitudinal valleys, formed in gneiss,\r\ngranite, and mica-slate. The most eastern of these valleys,\r\ncontaining the capital of Caracas, is 200 toises higher than the\r\nwestern valley, which may be considered as the centre of\r\nagricultural industry.\r\n\r\nHaving been for a long time accustomed to a moderate temperature,\r\nwe found the plains of the Tuy extremely hot, although the\r\nthermometer kept, in the day-time, between eleven in the morning\r\nand five in the afternoon, at only 23 or 24 degrees. The nights\r\nwere delightfully cool, the temperature falling as low as 17.5\r\ndegrees. As the heat gradually abated, the air became more and more\r\nfragrant with the odour of flowers. We remarked above all the\r\ndelicious perfume of the Lirio hermoso,* (* Pancratium undulatum.)\r\na new species of pancratium, of which the flower, eight or nine\r\ninches long, adorns the banks of the Rio Tuy. We spent two very\r\nagreeable days at the plantation of Don Jose de Manterola, who in\r\nhis youth had accompanied the Spanish embassy to Russia. The farm\r\nis a fine plantation of sugar-canes; and the ground is as smooth as\r\nthe bottom of a drained lake. The Rio Tuy winds through districts\r\ncovered with plantains, and a little wood of Hura crepitans,\r\nErythrina corallodendron, and fig-trees with nymphaea leaves. The\r\nbed of the river is formed of pebbles of quartz. I never met with\r\nmore agreeable bathing than in the Tuy. The water, as clear as\r\ncrystal, preserves even during the day a temperature of 18.6\r\ndegrees; a considerable coolness for these climates, and for a\r\nheight of three hundred toises; but the sources of the river are in\r\nthe surrounding mountains. The house of the proprietor, situated on\r\na hillock, of fifteen or twenty toises of elevation, is surrounded\r\nby the huts of the negroes. Those who are married provide food for\r\nthemselves; and here, as everywhere else in the valleys of Aragua,\r\na small spot of ground is allotted to them to cultivate. They\r\nlabour on that ground on Saturdays and Sundays, the only days in\r\nthe week on which they are free. They keep poultry, and sometimes\r\neven a pig. Their masters boast of their happiness, as in the north\r\nof Europe the great landholders love to descant upon the ease\r\nenjoyed by peasants who are attached to the glebe. On the day of\r\nour arrival we saw three fugitive negroes brought back; they were\r\nslaves newly purchased. I dreaded having to witness one of those\r\npunishments which, wherever slavery prevails, destroys all the\r\ncharm of a country life. Happily these blacks were treated with\r\nhumanity.\r\n\r\nIn this plantation, as in all those of the province of Venezuela,\r\nthree species of sugar-cane can be distinguished even at a distance\r\nby the colour of their leaves; the old Creole sugar-cane, the\r\nOtaheite cane, and the Batavia cane. The first has a deep-green\r\nleaf, the stem not very thick, and the knots rather near together.\r\nThis sugar-cane was the first introduced from India into Sicily,\r\nthe Canary Islands, and West Indies. The second is of a lighter\r\ngreen; and its stem is higher, thicker, and more succulent. The\r\nwhole plant exhibits a more luxuriant vegetation. We owe this plant\r\nto the voyages of Bougainville, Cook, and Bligh. Bougainville\r\ncarried it to the Mauritius, whence it passed to Cayenne,\r\nMartinique, and, since 1792, to the rest of the West India Islands.\r\nThe sugar-cane of Otaheite, called by the people of that island To,\r\nis one of the most important acquisitions for which colonial\r\nagriculture is indebted to the travels of naturalists. It yields\r\nnot only one-third more juice than the creolian cane on the same\r\nspace of ground; but from the thickness of its stem, and the\r\ntenacity of its ligneous fibres, it furnishes much more fuel. This\r\nlast advantage is important in the West Indies, where the\r\ndestruction of the forests has long obliged the planters to use\r\ncanes deprived of juice, to keep up the fire under the boilers. But\r\nfor the knowledge of this new plant, together with the progress of\r\nagriculture on the continent of Spanish America, and the\r\nintroduction of the East India and Java sugar, the prices of\r\ncolonial produce in Europe would have been much more sensibly\r\naffected by the revolutions of St. Domingo, and the destruction of\r\nthe great sugar plantations of that island. The Otaheite sugar-cane\r\nwas carried from the island of Trinidad to Caracas, under the name\r\nof Cana solera, and it passed from Caracas to Cucuta and San Gil in\r\nthe kingdom of New Grenada. In our days its cultivation during\r\ntwenty-five years has almost entirely removed the apprehension at\r\nfirst entertained, that being transplanted to America, the cane\r\nwould by degrees degenerate, and become as slender as the creole\r\ncane. The third species, the violet sugar-cane, called Cana de\r\nBatavia, or de Guinea, is certainly indigenous in the island of\r\nJava, where it is cultivated in preference in the districts of\r\nJapara and Pasuruan.* (* Raffles History of Java tome 1 page 124.)\r\nIts foliage is purple and very broad; and this cane is preferred in\r\nthe province of Caracas for rum. The tablones, or grounds planted\r\nwith sugar-canes, are divided by hedges of a colossal gramen; the\r\nlata, or gynerium, with distich leaves. At the Tuy, men were\r\nemployed in finishing a dyke, to form a canal of irrigation. This\r\nenterprise had cost the proprietor seven thousand piastres for the\r\nexpense of labour, and four thousand piastres for the costs of\r\nlawsuits in which he had become engaged with his neighbours. While\r\nthe lawyers were disputing about a canal of which only one-half was\r\nfinished, Don Jose de Manterola began to doubt even of the\r\npossibility of carrying the plan into execution. I took the level\r\nof the ground with a lunette d'epreuve, on an artificial horizon,\r\nand found, that the dam had been constructed eight feet too low.\r\nWhat sums of money have I seen expended uselessly in the Spanish\r\ncolonies, for undertakings founded on erroneous levelling!\r\n\r\nThe valley of the Tuy has its 'gold mine,' like almost every part\r\nof America inhabited by whites, and backed by primitive mountains.\r\nI was assured, that in 1780, foreign gold-gatherers had been\r\nengaged in picking up grains of that metal, and had established a\r\nplace for washing the sand in the Quebrada del Oro. An overseer of\r\na neighbouring plantation had followed these indications; and after\r\nhis death, a waistcoat with gold buttons being found among his\r\nclothes, this gold, according to the logic of the people here,\r\ncould only have proceeded from a vein, which the falling in of the\r\nearth had rendered invisible. In vain I objected, that I could not,\r\nby the mere view of the soil, without digging a large trench in the\r\ndirection of the vein, judge of the existence of the mine; I was\r\ncompelled to yield to the desire of my hosts. For twenty years past\r\nthe overseer's waistcoat had been the subject of conversation in\r\nthe country. Gold extracted from the bosom of the earth is far more\r\nalluring in the eyes of the vulgar, than that which is the produce\r\nof agricultural industry, favoured by the fertility of the soil,\r\nand the mildness of the climate.\r\n\r\nNorth-west of the Hacienda del Tuy, in the northern range of the\r\nchain of the coast, we find a deep ravine, called the Quebrada\r\nSeca, because the torrent, by which it was formed, loses its waters\r\nthrough the crevices of the rock, before it reaches the extremity\r\nof the ravine. The whole of this mountainous country is covered\r\nwith thick vegetation. We there found the same verdure as had\r\ncharmed us by its freshness in the mountains of Buenavista and Las\r\nLagunetas, wherever the ground rises as high as the region of the\r\nclouds, and where the vapours of the sea have free access. In the\r\nplains, on the contrary, many trees are stripped of a part of their\r\nleaves during the winter; and when we descend into the valley of\r\nthe Tuy, we are struck with the almost hibernal aspect of the\r\ncountry. The dryness of the air is such that the hygrometer of\r\nDeluc keeps day and night between 36 and 40 degrees. At a distance\r\nfrom the river scarcely any huras or piper-trees extend their\r\nfoliage over thickets destitute of verdure. This seems owing to the\r\ndryness of the air, which attains its maximum in the month of\r\nFebruary; and not, as the European planters assert, \"to the seasons\r\nof Spain, of which the empire extends as far as the torrid zone.\"\r\nIt is only plants transported from one hemisphere to the other,\r\nwhich, in their organic functions, in the development of their\r\nleaves and flowers, still retain their affinity to a distant\r\nclimate: faithful to their habits, they follow for a long time the\r\nperiodical changes of their native hemisphere. In the province of\r\nVenezuela the trees stripped of their foliage begin to renew their\r\nleaves nearly a month before the rainy season. It is probable, that\r\nat this period the electrical equilibrium of the air is already\r\ndisturbed, and the atmosphere, although not yet clouded, becomes\r\ngradually more humid. The azure of the sky is paler, and the\r\nelevated regions are loaded with light vapours, uniformly diffused.\r\nThis season may be considered as the awakening of nature; it is a\r\nspring which, according to the received language of the Spanish\r\ncolonies, proclaims the beginning of winter, and succeeds to the\r\nheats of summer.* (* That part of the year most abundant in rain is\r\ncalled winter; so that in Terra Firma, the season which begins by\r\nthe winter solstice, is designated by the name of summer; and it is\r\nusual to hear, that it is winter on the mountains, at the time when\r\nsummer prevails in the neighbouring plains.)\r\n\r\nIndigo was formerly cultivated in the Quebrada Seca; but as the\r\nsoil covered with vegetation cannot there concentrate so much heat\r\nas the plains and the bottom of the Tuy valley receive and radiate,\r\nthe cultivation of coffee has been substituted in its stead. As we\r\nadvanced in the ravine we found the moisture increase. Near the\r\nHato, at the northern extremity of the Quebrada, a torrent rolls\r\ndown over sloping beds of gneiss. An aqueduct was being formed\r\nthere to convey the water to the plain. Without irrigation,\r\nagriculture makes no progress in these climates. A tree of\r\nmonstrous size fixed our attention.* (* Hura crepitans.) It lay on\r\nthe slope of the mountain, above the house of the Hato. On the\r\nleast dislodgment of the earth, its fall would have crushed the\r\nhabitation which it shaded: it had therefore been burnt near its\r\nfoot, and cut down in such a manner, that it fell between some\r\nenormous fig-trees, which prevented it from rolling into the\r\nravine. We measured the fallen tree; and though its summit had been\r\nburnt, the length of its trunk was still one hundred and fifty-four\r\nfeet.* (* French measure, nearly fifty metres.) It was eight feet\r\nin diameter near the roots, and four feet two inches at the upper\r\nextremity.\r\n\r\nOur guides, less anxious than ourselves to measure the bulk of\r\ntrees, continually pressed us to proceed onward and seek the 'gold\r\nmine.' This part of the ravine is little frequented, and is not\r\nuninteresting. We made the following observations on the geological\r\nconstitution of the soil. At the entrance of the Quebrada Seca we\r\nremarked great masses of primitive saccharoidal limestone,\r\ntolerably fine grained, of a bluish tint, and traversed by veins of\r\ncalcareous spar of dazzling whiteness. These calcareous masses must\r\nnot be confounded with the very recent depositions of tufa, or\r\ncarbonate of lime, which fill the plains of the Tuy; they form beds\r\nof mica-slate, passing into talc-slate.* (* Talkschiefer of Werner,\r\nwithout garnets or serpentine; not eurite or weisstein. It is in\r\nthe mountains of Buenavista that the gneiss manifests a tendency to\r\npass into eurite.) The primitive limestone often simply covers this\r\nlatter rock in concordant stratification. Very near the Hato the\r\ntalcose slate becomes entirely white, and contains small layers of\r\nsoft and unctuous graphic ampelite.* (* Zeichenschiefer.) Some\r\npieces, destitute of veins of quartz, are real granular plumbago,\r\nwhich might be of use in the arts. The aspect of the rock is very\r\nsingular in those places where thin plates of black ampelite\r\nalternate with thin, sinuous, and satiny plates of a talcose slate\r\nas white as snow. It would seem as if the carbon and iron, which in\r\nother places colour the primitive rocks, are here concentrated in\r\nthe subordinate strata.\r\n\r\nTurning westward we reached at length the ravine of gold (Quebrada\r\ndel Oro). On examining the slope of a hill, we could hardly\r\nrecognize the vestige of a vein of quartz. The falling of the earth\r\ncaused by the rains had changed the surface of the ground, and\r\nrendered it impossible to make any observation. Great trees were\r\ngrowing in the places where the gold-washers had worked twenty\r\nyears before. It is probable that the mica-slate contains here, as\r\nnear Goldcronach in Franconia, and in Salzburgh, auriferous veins;\r\nbut how is it possible to judge whether they be worth the expense\r\nof being wrought, or whether the ore is only in nodules, and in the\r\nless abundance in proportion as it is rich? We made a long\r\nherborization in a thick forest, extending beyond the Hato, and\r\nabounding in cedrelas, browneas, and fig-trees with nymphaea\r\nleaves. The trunks of these last are covered with very odoriferous\r\nplants of vanilla, which in general flower only in the month of\r\nApril. We were here again struck with those ligneous excrescences,\r\nwhich in the form of ridges, or ribs, augment to the height of\r\ntwenty feet above the ground, the thickness of the trunk of the\r\nfig-trees of America. I found trees twenty-two feet and a half in\r\ndiameter near the roots. These ligneous ridges sometimes separate\r\nfrom the trunk at a height of eight feet, and are transformed into\r\ncylindrical roots two feet thick. The tree looks as if it were\r\nsupported by buttresses. This scaffolding however does not\r\npenetrate very deep into the earth. The lateral roots wind at the\r\nsurface of the ground, and if at twenty feet distance from the\r\ntrunk they are cut with a hatchet, we see gushing out the milky\r\njuice of the fig-tree, which, when deprived of the vital influence\r\nof the organs of the tree, is altered and coagulates. What a\r\nwonderful combination of cells and vessels exist in these vegetable\r\nmasses, in these gigantic trees of the torrid zone, which without\r\ninterruption, perhaps during the space of a thousand years, prepare\r\nnutritious fluids, raise them to the height of one hundred and\r\neighty feet, convey them down again to the ground, and conceal,\r\nbeneath a rough and hard bark, under inanimate layers of ligneous\r\nmatter, all the movements of organic life!\r\n\r\nI availed myself of the clearness of the nights, to observe at the\r\nplantation of Tuy two emersions of the first and third satellites\r\nof Jupiter. These two observations gave, according to the tables of\r\nDelambre, longitude 4 hours 39 minutes 14 seconds; and by the\r\nchronometer I found 4 hours 39 minutes 10 seconds. During my stay\r\nin the valleys of the Tuy and Aragua the zodiacal light appeared\r\nalmost every night with extraordinary brilliancy. I had perceived\r\nit for the first time between the tropics at Caracas, on the 18th\r\nof January, after seven in the evening. The point of the pyramid\r\nwas at the height of 53 degrees. The light totally disappeared at\r\n9 hours 35 minutes (apparent time), nearly 3 hours 50 minutes after\r\nsunset, without any diminution in the serenity of the sky. La Caille,\r\nin his voyage to Rio Janeiro and the Cape, was struck with the\r\nbeautiful appearance displayed by the zodiacal light within the\r\ntropics, not so much on account of its less inclined position,\r\nas of the greater transparency of the air.* (* The great serenity\r\nof the air caused this phenomenon to be remarked, in 1668, in the\r\narid plains of Persia.) It may appear singular, that Childrey and\r\nDominic Cassini, navigators who were well acquainted with the seas\r\nof the two Indies, did not at a much earlier period direct the\r\nattention of scientific Europe to this light, and its regular form\r\nand progress. Until the middle of the eighteenth century mariners\r\nwere little interested by anything not having immediate relation\r\nto the course of a ship, and the demands of navigation.\r\n\r\nHowever brilliant the zodiacal light in the dry valley of Tuy, I\r\nhave observed it more beautiful still at the back of the\r\nCordilleras of Mexico, on the banks of the lake of Tezcuco, eleven\r\nhundred and sixty toises above the surface of the ocean. In the\r\nmonth of January, 1804, the light rose sometimes to more than 60\r\ndegrees above the horizon. The Milky Way appeared to grow pale\r\ncompared with the brilliancy of the zodiacal light; and if small,\r\nbluish, scattered clouds were accumulated toward the west, it\r\nseemed as if the moon were about to rise.\r\n\r\nI must here relate another very singular fact. On the 18th of\r\nJanuary, and the 15th of February, 1800, the intensity of the\r\nzodiacal light changed in a very perceptible manner, at intervals\r\nof two or three minutes. Sometimes it was very faint, at others it\r\nsurpassed the brilliancy of the Milky Way in Sagittarius. The\r\nchanges took place in the whole pyramid, especially toward the\r\ninterior, far from the edges. During these variations of the\r\nzodiacal light, the hygrometer indicated considerable dryness. The\r\nstars of the fourth and fifth magnitude appeared constantly to the\r\nnaked eye with the same degree of light. No stream of vapour was\r\nvisible: nothing seemed to alter the transparency of the\r\natmosphere. In other years I saw the zodiacal light augment in the\r\nsouthern hemisphere half an hour before its disappearance. Cassini\r\nadmitted \"that the zodiacal light was feebler in certain years, and\r\nthen returned to its former brilliancy.\" He thought that these slow\r\nchanges were connected with \"the same emanations which render the\r\nappearance of spots and faculae periodical on the solar disk.\" But\r\nthis excellent observer does not mention those changes of intensity\r\nin the zodiacal light which I have several times remarked within\r\nthe tropics, in the space of a few minutes. Mairan asserts, that in\r\nFrance it is common enough to see the zodiacal light, in the months\r\nof February and March, mingling with a kind of Aurora Borealis,\r\nwhich he calls 'undecided,' and the nebulous matter of which\r\nspreads itself all around the horizon, or appears toward the west.\r\nI very much doubt, whether, in the observations I have been\r\ndescribing, there was any mixture of these two species of light.\r\nThe variations in intensity took place at considerable altitudes;\r\nthe light was white, and not coloured; steady, and not undulating.\r\nBesides, the Aurora Borealis is so seldom visible within the\r\ntropics, that during five years, though almost constantly sleeping\r\nin the open air, and observing the heavens with unremitting\r\nattention, I never perceived the least traces of that phenomenon.\r\n\r\nI am rather inclined to think that the variations of the zodiacal\r\nlight are not all appearances dependent on certain modifications in\r\nthe state of our atmosphere. Sometimes, during nights equally\r\nclear, I sought in vain for the zodiacal light, when, on the\r\nprevious night, it had appeared with the greatest brilliancy. Must\r\nwe admit that emanations which reflect white light, and seem to\r\nhave some analogy with the tails of comets, are less abundant at\r\ncertain periods? Researches on the zodiacal light have acquired a\r\nnew degree of interest since geometricians have taught us that we\r\nare ignorant of the real causes of this phenomenon. The illustrious\r\nauthor of \"La Mecanique Celeste\" has shown that the solar\r\natmosphere cannot reach even the planet Mercury; and that it could\r\nnot in any case display the lenticular form which has been\r\nattributed to the zodiacal light. We may also entertain the same\r\ndoubts respecting the nature of this light, as with regard to that\r\nof the tails of comets. Is it in fact a reflected or a direct\r\nlight?\r\n\r\nWe left the plantation of Manterola on the 11th of February, at\r\nsunrise. The road runs along the smiling banks of the Tuy; the\r\nmorning was cool and humid, and the air seemed embalmed by the\r\ndelicious odour of the Pancratium undulatum, and other large\r\nliliaceous plants. In our way to La Victoria, we passed the pretty\r\nvillage of Mamon or of Consejo, celebrated in the country for a\r\nmiraculous image of the Virgin. A little before we reached Mamon,\r\nwe stopped at a farm belonging to the family of Monteras. A negress\r\nmore than a hundred years old was seated before a small hut built\r\nof earth and reeds. Her age was known because she was a creole\r\nslave. She seemed still to enjoy very good health. \"I keep her in\r\nthe sun\" (la tengo al sol), said her grandson; \"the heat keeps her\r\nalive.\" This appeared to us not a very agreeable mode of prolonging\r\nlife, for the sun was darting his rays almost perpendicularly. The\r\nbrown-skinned nations, blacks well seasoned, and Indians,\r\nfrequently attain a very advanced age in the torrid zone. A native\r\nof Peru named Hilario Pari died at the extraordinary age of one\r\nhundred and forty-three years, after having been ninety years\r\nmarried.\r\n\r\nDon Francisco Montera and his brother, a well-informed young\r\npriest, accompanied us with the view of conducting us to their\r\nhouse at La Victoria. Almost all the families with whom we had\r\nlived in friendship at Caracas were assembled in the fine valleys\r\nof Aragua, and they vied with each other in their efforts to render\r\nour stay agreeable. Before we plunged into the forests of the\r\nOrinoco, we enjoyed once more all the advantages which advanced\r\ncivilization affords.\r\n\r\nThe road from Mamon to La Victoria runs south and south-west. We\r\nsoon lost sight of the river Tuy, which, turning eastward, forms an\r\nelbow at the foot of the high mountains of Guayraima. As we drew\r\nnearer to Victoria the ground became smoother; it seemed like the\r\nbottom of a lake, the waters of which had been drained off. We\r\nmight have fancied ourselves in the valley of Hasli, in the canton\r\nof Berne. The neighbouring hills, only one hundred and forty toises\r\nin height, are composed of calcareous tufa; but their abrupt\r\ndeclivities project like promontories on the plain. Their form\r\nindicates the ancient shore of the lake. The eastern extremity of\r\nthis valley is parched and uncultivated. No advantage has been\r\nderived from the ravines which water the neighbouring mountains;\r\nbut fine cultivation is commencing in the proximity of the town. I\r\nsay of the town, though in my time Victoria was considered only as\r\na village (pueblo).\r\n\r\nThe environs of La Victoria present a very remarkable agricultural\r\naspect. The height of the cultivated ground is from two hundred and\r\nseventy to three hundred toises above the level of the ocean, and\r\nyet we there find fields of corn mingled with plantations of\r\nsugar-cane, coffee, and plantains. Excepting the interior of the\r\nisland of Cuba,* (* The district of Quatro Villas.) we scarcely\r\nfind elsewhere in the equinoctial regions European corn cultivated\r\nin large quantities in so low a region. The fine fields of wheat in\r\nMexico are between six hundred and twelve hundred toises of\r\nabsolute elevation; and it is rare to see them descend to four\r\nhundred toises. We shall soon perceive that the produce of grain\r\naugments sensibly, from high latitudes towards the equator, with\r\nthe mean temperature of the climate, in comparing spots of\r\ndifferent elevations. The success of agriculture depends on the\r\ndryness of the air; on the rains distributed through different\r\nseasons, or accumulated in one season; on winds blowing constantly\r\nfrom the east; or bringing the cold air of the north into very low\r\nlatitudes, as in the gulf of Mexico; on mists, which for whole\r\nmonths diminish the intensity of the solar rays; in short, on a\r\nthousand local circumstances which have less influence on the mean\r\ntemperature of the whole year than on the distribution of the same\r\nquantity of heat through the different parts of the year. It is a\r\nstriking spectacle to see the grain of Europe cultivated from the\r\nequator as far as Lapland in the latitude of 69 degrees, in regions\r\nwhere the mean heat is from 22 to-2 degrees, in every place where\r\nthe temperature of summer is above 9 or 10 degrees. We know the\r\nminimum of heat requisite to ripen wheat, barley, and oats; but we\r\nare less certain in respect to the maximum which these species of\r\ngrain, accommodating as they are, can support. We are even ignorant\r\nof all the circumstances which favour the culture of corn within\r\nthe tropics at very small heights. La Victoria and the neighbouring\r\nvillage of San Mateo yield an annual produce of four thousand\r\nquintals of wheat. It is sown in the month of December, and the\r\nharvest is reaped on the seventieth or seventy-fifth day. The grain\r\nis large, white, and abounding in gluten; its pellicle is thinner\r\nand not so hard as that of the wheat of the very cold table-lands\r\nof Mexico. An acre* (* An arpent des eaux et forets, or legal acre\r\nof France, of which 1.95 = 1 hectare. It is about 1 1/4 acre\r\nEnglish.) near Victoria generally yields from three thousand to\r\nthree thousand two hundred pounds weight of wheat. The average\r\nproduce is consequently here, as at Buenos Ayres, three or four\r\ntimes as much as that of northern countries. Nearly sixteenfold of\r\nthe quantity of seed is reaped; while, according to Lavoisier, the\r\nsurface of France yields on an average only five or six for one, or\r\nfrom one thousand to twelve hundred pounds per acre.\r\nNotwithstanding this fecundity of the soil, and this happy\r\ninfluence of the climate, the culture of the sugar-cane is more\r\nproductive in the valleys of Aragua than that of corn.\r\n\r\nLa Victoria is traversed by the little river Calanchas, running,\r\nnot into the Tuy, but into the Rio Aragua: it thence results that\r\nthis fine country, producing at once sugar and corn, belongs to the\r\nbasin of the lake of Valencia, to a system of interior rivers not\r\ncommunicating with the sea. The quarter of the town west of the Rio\r\nCalanchas is called la otra banda; it is the most commercial part;\r\nmerchandize is everywhere exhibited, and ranges of shops form the\r\nstreets. Two commercial roads pass through La Victoria, that of\r\nValencia, or of Porto Cabello, and the road of Villa de Cura, or of\r\nthe plains, called camino de los Llanos. We here find more whites\r\nin proportion than at Caracas. We visited at sunset the little hill\r\nof Calvary, where the view is extremely fine and extensive. We\r\ndiscover on the west the lovely valleys of Aragua, a vast space\r\ncovered with gardens, cultivated fields, clumps of wild trees,\r\nfarms, and hamlets. Turning south and south-east, we see, extending\r\nas far as the eye can reach, the lofty mountains of La Palma,\r\nGuayraima, Tiara, and Guiripa, which conceal the immense plains or\r\nsteppes of Calabozo. This interior chain stretches westward along\r\nthe lake of Valencia, towards the Villa de Cura, the Cuesta de\r\nYusma, and the denticulated mountains of Guigne. It is very steep,\r\nand constantly covered with that light vapour which in hot climates\r\ngives a vivid blue tint to distant objects, and, far from\r\nconcealing their outlines, marks them the more strongly. It is\r\nbelieved that among the mountains of the interior chain, that of\r\nGuayraima reaches an elevation of twelve hundred toises. I found in\r\nthe night of the eleventh of February the latitude of La Victoria\r\n10 degrees 13 minutes 35 seconds, the magnetic dip 40.8 degrees, the\r\nintensity of the forces equal to 236 oscillations in ten minutes of\r\ntime, and the variation of the needle 4.4 degrees north-east.\r\n\r\nWe proceeded slowly on our way by the villages of San Mateo,\r\nTurmero, and Maracay, to the Hacienda de Cura, a fine plantation\r\nbelonging to Count Tovar, where we arrived on the evening of the\r\nfourteenth of February. The valley, which gradually widens, is\r\nbordered with hills of calcareous tufa, called here tierra blanca.\r\nThe scientific men of the country have made several attempts to\r\ncalcine this earth, mistaking it for the porcelain earth proceeding\r\nfrom decomposed strata of feldspar. We stayed some hours with a\r\nvery intelligent family, named Ustariz, at Concesion. Their house,\r\nwhich contains a collection of choice books, stands on an eminence,\r\nand is surrounded by plantations of coffee and sugar-cane. A grove\r\nof balsam-trees (balsamo* (* Amyris elata.)) gives coolness and\r\nshade to this spot. It was gratifying to observe the great number\r\nof scattered houses in the valley inhabited by freedmen. In the\r\nSpanish colonies, the laws, the institutions, and the manners, are\r\nmore favourable to the liberty of the negroes than in other\r\nEuropean settlements.\r\n\r\nSan Mateo, Turmero, and Maracay, are charming villages, where\r\neverything denotes the comfort of the inhabitants. We seemed to be\r\ntransported to the most industrious districts of Catalonia. Near\r\nSan Mateo we find the last fields of wheat, and the last mills with\r\nhorizontal hydraulic wheels. A harvest of twenty for one was\r\nexpected; and, as if that produce were but moderate, I was asked\r\nwhether corn yielded more in Prussia and in Poland. By an error\r\ngenerally prevalent under the tropics, the produce of grain is\r\nsupposed to degenerate in advancing towards the equator, and\r\nharvests are believed to be more abundant in northern climates.\r\nSince calculations have been made on the progress of agriculture in\r\nthe different zones, and on the temperatures under the influence of\r\nwhich corn will flourish, it has been found that, beyond the\r\nlatitude of 45 degrees, the produce of wheat is nowhere so\r\nconsiderable as on the northern coasts of Africa, and on the\r\ntable-lands of New Grenada, Peru, and Mexico. Without comparing the\r\nmean temperature of the whole year, but only the mean temperature\r\nof the season which embraces the corn cycle of vegetation, we find\r\nfor three months of summer,* in the north of Europe, from 15 to 19\r\ndegrees; in Barbary and in Egypt, from 27 to 29 degrees; within the\r\ntropics, between fourteen and three hundred toises of height, from\r\n14 to 25.5 degrees of the centigrade thermometer. (* The mean heat\r\nof the summers of Scotland in the environs of Edinburgh, (latitude\r\n56 degrees), is found again on the table-lands of New Grenada, so\r\nrich in wheat, at 1400 toises of elevation, and at 4 degrees north\r\nlatitude. On the other hand, we find the mean temperature of the\r\nvalleys of Aragua, latitude 10 degrees 13 minutes, and of all the\r\nplains which are not very elevated in the torrid zone, in the\r\nsummer temperature of Naples and Sicily, latitude 39 to 40 degrees.\r\nThese figures indicate the situation of the isotheric lines (lines\r\nof the same summer heat), and not that of the isothermal lines\r\n(those of equal annual temperature). Considering the quantity of\r\nheat received on the same spot of the globe during a whole year,\r\nthe mean temperatures of the valleys of Aragua, and the table-lands\r\nof New Grenada, at 300 and 1400 toises of elevation, correspond to\r\nthe mean temperatures of the coasts at 23 and 45 degrees of\r\nlatitude.)\r\n\r\nThe fine harvests of Egypt and of Algiers, as well as those of the\r\nvalleys of Aragua and the interior of the island of Cuba,\r\nsufficiently prove that the augmentation of heat is not prejudicial\r\nto the harvest of wheat and other alimentary grain, unless it be\r\nattended with an excess of drought or moisture. To this\r\ncircumstance no doubt we must attribute the apparent anomalies\r\nsometimes observed within the tropics, in the lower limit of corn.\r\nWe are astonished to see, eastward of the Havannah, in the famous\r\ndistrict of Quatro Villas, that this limit descends almost to the\r\nlevel of the ocean; whilst west of the Havannah, on the slope of\r\nthe mountains of Mexico and Xalapa, at six hundred and\r\nseventy-seven toises of height, the luxuriance of vegetation is\r\nsuch, that wheat does not form ears. At the beginning of the\r\nSpanish conquest, the corn of Europe was cultivated with success in\r\nseveral regions now supposed to be too hot, or too damp, for this\r\nbranch of agriculture. The Spaniards on their first removal to\r\nAmerica were little accustomed to live on maize. They still adhered\r\nto their European habits. They did not calculate whether corn would\r\nbe less profitable than coffee or cotton. They tried seeds of every\r\nkind, making experiments the more boldly because their reasonings\r\nwere less founded on false theories. The province of Carthagena,\r\ncrossed by the chain of the mountains Maria and Guamoco, produced\r\nwheat till the sixteenth century. In the province of Caracas, this\r\nculture is of very ancient date in the mountainous lands of Tocuyo,\r\nQuibor, and Barquisimeto, which connect the littoral chain with the\r\nSierra Nevada of Merida. Wheat is still successfully cultivated\r\nthere, and the environs of the town of Tocuyo alone export annually\r\nmore than eight thousand quintals of excellent flour. But, though\r\nthe province of Caracas, in its vast extent, includes several spots\r\nvery favourable to the cultivation of European corn, I believe that\r\nin general this branch of agriculture will never acquire any great\r\nimportance there. The most temperate valleys are not sufficiently\r\nwide; they are not real table-lands; and their mean elevation above\r\nthe level of the sea is not so considerable but that the\r\ninhabitants cannot fail to perceive that it is more their interest\r\nto establish plantations of coffee, than to cultivate corn. Flour\r\nnow comes to Caracas either from Spain or from the United States.\r\n\r\nThe village of Turmero is four leagues distant from San Mateo. The\r\nroad leads through plantations of sugar, indigo, cotton, and\r\ncoffee. The regularity observable in the construction of the\r\nvillages, reminded us that they all owe their origin to monks and\r\nmissions. The streets are straight and parallel, crossing each\r\nother at right angles; and the church is invariably erected in the\r\ngreat square, situated in the centre of the village. The church of\r\nTurmero is a fine edifice, but overloaded with architectural\r\nornaments. Since the missionaries have been replaced by vicars, the\r\nwhites have mingled their habitations with those of the Indians.\r\nThe latter are gradually disappearing as a separate race; that is\r\nto say, they are represented in the general statement of the\r\npopulation by the Mestizoes and the Zamboes, whose numbers daily\r\nincrease. I still found, however, four thousand tributary Indians\r\nin the valleys of Aragua. Those of Turmero and Guacara are the most\r\nnumerous. They are of small stature, but less squat than the\r\nChaymas; their eyes denote more vivacity and intelligence, owing\r\nless perhaps to a diversity in the race, than to a superior state\r\nof civilization. They work like freemen by the day. Though active\r\nand laborious during the short time they allot to labour, yet what\r\nthey earn in two months is spent in one week, in the purchase of\r\nstrong liquors at the small inns, of which unhappily the numbers\r\ndaily increase.\r\n\r\nWe saw at Turmero the remains of the assembled militia of the\r\ncountry, and their appearance alone sufficiently indicated that\r\nthese valleys had enjoyed for ages undisturbed peace. The\r\ncapitan-general, in order to give a new impulse to the military\r\nservice, had ordered a grand review; and the battalion of Turmero,\r\nin a mock fight, had fired on that of La Victoria. Our host, a\r\nlieutenant of the militia, was never weary of describing to us the\r\ndanger of these manoeuvres, which seemed more burlesque than\r\nimposing. With what rapidity do nations, apparently the most\r\npacific, acquire military habits! Twelve years afterwards, those\r\nvalleys of Aragua, those peaceful plains of La Victoria and\r\nTurmero, the defile of Cabrera, and the fertile banks of the lake\r\nof Valencia, became the scenes of obstinate and sanguinary\r\nconflicts between the natives and the troops of the mother-country.\r\n\r\nSouth of Turmero, a mass of limestone mountains advances into the\r\nplain, separating two fine sugar-plantations, Guayavita and Paja.\r\nThe latter belongs to the family of Count Tovar, who have property\r\nin every part of the province. Near Guayavita, brown iron-ore has\r\nbeen discovered. To the north of Turmero, a granitic summit (the\r\nChuao) rises in the Cordillera of the coast, from the top of which\r\nwe discern at once the sea and the lake of Valencia. Crossing this\r\nrocky ridge, which runs towards the west farther than the eye can\r\nreach, paths somewhat difficult lead to the rich plantations of\r\ncacao on the coast, to Choroni, Turiamo, and Ocumare, noted alike\r\nfor the fertility of the soil and the insalubrity of their climate.\r\nTurmero, Maracay, Cura, Guacara, every point of the valley of\r\nAragua, has its mountain-road, which terminates at one of the small\r\nports on the coast.\r\n\r\nOn quitting the village of Turmero, we discover, at a league\r\ndistant, an object, which appears at the horizon like a round\r\nhillock, or tumulus, covered with vegetation. It is neither a hill,\r\nnor a group of trees close to each other, but one single tree, the\r\nfamous zamang del Guayre, known throughout the province for the\r\nenormous extent of its branches, which form a hemispheric head five\r\nhundred and seventy-six feet in circumference. The zamang is a fine\r\nspecies of mimosa, and its tortuous branches are divided by\r\nbifurcation. Its delicate and tender foliage was agreeably relieved\r\non the azure of the sky. We stopped a long time under this\r\nvegetable roof. The trunk of the zamang del Guayre,* (* The mimos\r\nof La Guayre; zamang being the Indian name for the genera mimosa,\r\ndesmanthus, and acacia. The place where the tree is found is called\r\nEl Guayre.) which is found on the road from Turmero to Maracay, is\r\nonly sixty feet high, and nine thick; but its real beauty consists\r\nin the form of its head. The branches extend like an immense\r\numbrella, and bend toward the ground, from which they remain at a\r\nuniform distance of twelve or fifteen feet. The circumference of\r\nthis head is so regular, that, having traced different diameters, I\r\nfound them one hundred and ninety-two and one hundred and\r\neighty-six feet. One side of the tree was entirely stripped of its\r\nfoliage, owing to the drought; but on the other side there remained\r\nboth leaves and flowers. Tillandsias, lorantheae, Cactus Pitahaya,\r\nand other parasite plants, cover its branches, and crack the bark.\r\nThe inhabitants of these villages, but particularly the Indians,\r\nhold in veneration the zamang del Guayre, which the first\r\nconquerors found almost in the same state in which it now remains.\r\nSince it has been observed with attention, no change has appeared\r\nin its thickness or height. This zamang must be at least as old as\r\nthe Orotava dragon-tree. There is something solemn and majestic in\r\nthe aspect of aged trees; and the violation of these monuments of\r\nnature is severely punished in countries destitute of monuments of\r\nart. We heard with satisfaction that the present proprietor of the\r\nzamang had brought an action against a cultivator who had been\r\nguilty of cutting off a branch. The cause was tried, and the\r\ntribunal condemned the offender. We find near Turmero and the\r\nHacienda de Cura other zamangs, having trunks larger than that of\r\nGuayre, but their hemispherical heads are not of equal extent.\r\n\r\nThe culture and population of the plains augment in the direction\r\nof Cura and Guacara, on the northern side of the lake. The valleys\r\nof Aragua contain more than 52,000 inhabitants, on a space thirteen\r\nleagues in length, and two in width. This is a relative population\r\nof two thousand souls on a square league. The village or rather the\r\nsmall town of Maracay was heretofore the centre of the indigo\r\nplantations, when this branch of colonial industry was in its\r\ngreatest prosperity. The houses are all of masonry, and every court\r\ncontains cocoa-trees, which rise above the habitations. The aspect\r\nof general wealth is still more striking at Maracay, than at\r\nTurmero. The anil, or indigo, of these provinces has always been\r\nconsidered in commerce as equal and sometimes superior to that of\r\nGuatemala. The indigo plant impoverishes the soil, where it is\r\ncultivated during a long series of years, more than any other. The\r\nlands of Maracay, Tapatapa, and Turmero, are looked upon as\r\nexhausted; and indeed the produce of indigo has been constantly\r\ndecreasing. But in proportion as it has diminished in the valleys\r\nof Aragua, it has increased in the province of Varinas, and in the\r\nburning plains of Cucuta, where, on the banks of the Rio Tachira,\r\nvirgin land yields an abundant produce, of the richest colour.\r\n\r\nWe arrived very late at Maracay, and the persons to whom we were\r\nrecommended were absent. The inhabitants perceiving our\r\nembarrassment, contended with each other in offering to lodge us,\r\nto place our instruments, and take care of our mules. It has been\r\nsaid a thousand times, but the traveller always feels desirous of\r\nrepeating it again, that the Spanish colonies are the land of\r\nhospitality; they are so even in those places where industry and\r\ncommerce have diffused wealth and improvement. A family of\r\nCanarians received us with the most amiable cordiality; an\r\nexcellent repast was prepared, and everything was carefully avoided\r\nthat might act as any restraint on us. The master of the house, Don\r\nAlexandro Gonzales, was travelling on commercial business, and his\r\nyoung wife had lately had the happiness of becoming a mother. She\r\nwas transported with joy when she heard that on our return from the\r\nRio Negro we should proceed by the banks of the Orinoco to\r\nAngostura, where her husband was. We were to bear to him the\r\ntidings of the birth of his first child. In those countries, as\r\namong the ancients, travellers are regarded as the safest means of\r\ncommunication. There are indeed posts established, but they make\r\nsuch great circuits that private persons seldom entrust them with\r\nletters for the llanos or savannahs of the interior. The child was\r\nbrought to us at the moment of our departure: we had seen him\r\nasleep at night, but it was deemed indispensable that we should see\r\nhim awake in the morning. We promised to describe his features\r\nexactly to his father, but the sight of our books and instruments\r\nsomewhat chilled the mother's confidence. She said \"that in a long\r\njourney, amidst so many cares of another kind, we might well forget\r\nthe colour of her child's eyes.\"\r\n\r\nOn the road from Maracay to the Hacienda de Cura we enjoyed from\r\ntime to time the view of the lake of Valencia. An arm of the\r\ngranitic chain of the coast stretches southward into the plain. It\r\nis the promontory of Portachuelo which would almost close the\r\nvalley, were it not separated by a narrow defile from the rock of\r\nLa Cabrera. This place has acquired a sad celebrity in the late\r\nrevolutionary wars of Caracas; each party having obstinately\r\ndisputed its possession, as opening the way to Valencia, and to the\r\nLlanos. La Cabrera now forms a peninsula: not sixty years ago it\r\nwas a rocky island in the lake, the waters of which gradually\r\ndiminish. We spent seven very agreeable days at the Hacienda da\r\nCura, in a small habitation surrounded by thickets.\r\n\r\nWe lived after the manner of the rich in this country; we bathed\r\ntwice, slept three times, and made three meals in the twenty-four\r\nhours. The temperature of the water of the lake is rather warm,\r\nbeing from twenty-four to twenty-five degrees; but there is another\r\ncool and delicious bathing-place at Toma, under the shade of ceibas\r\nand large zamangs, in a torrent gushing from the granitic mountains\r\nof the Rincon del Diablo. In entering this bath, we had not to fear\r\nthe sting of insects, but to guard against the little brown hairs\r\nwhich cover the pods of the Dolichos pruriens. When these small\r\nhairs, well characterised by the name of picapica, stick to the\r\nbody, they excite a violent irritation on the skin; the dart is\r\nfelt, but the cause is unperceived.\r\n\r\nNear Cura we found all the people occupied in clearing the ground\r\ncovered with mimosa, sterculia, and Coccoloba excoriata, for the\r\npurpose of extending the cultivation of cotton. This product, which\r\npartly supplies the place of indigo, has succeeded so well during\r\nsome years, that the cotton-tree now grows wild on the borders of\r\nthe lake of Valencia. We have found shrubs of eight or ten feet\r\nhigh entwined with bignonia and other ligneous creepers. The\r\nexportation of cotton from Caracas, however, is yet of small\r\nimportance. It amounted at an average at La Guayra scarcely to\r\nthree or four hundred thousand pounds in a year; but including all\r\nthe ports of the Capitania-general, it arose, on account of the\r\nflourishing culture of Cariaco, Nueva Barcelona, and Maracaybo, to\r\nmore than 22,000 quintals. The cotton of the valleys of Aragua is\r\nof fine quality, being inferior only to that of Brazil; for it is\r\npreferred to that of Carthagena, St. Domingo, and the Caribbee\r\nIslands. The cultivation of cotton extends on one side of the lake\r\nfrom Maracay to Valencia; and on the other from Guayca to Guigue.\r\nThe large plantations yield from sixty to seventy thousand pounds a\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nDuring our stay at Cura we made numerous excursions to the rocky\r\nislands (which rise in the midst of the lake of Valencia,) to the\r\nwarm springs of Mariara, and to the lofty granitic mountain called\r\nEl Cucurucho de Coco. A dangerous and narrow path leads to the port\r\nof Turiamo and the celebrated cacao-plantations of the coast. In\r\nall these excursions we were agreeably surprised, not only at the\r\nprogress of agriculture, but at the increase of a free laborious\r\npopulation, accustomed to toil, and too poor to rely on the\r\nassistance of slaves. White and mulatto farmers had everywhere\r\nsmall separate establishments. Our host, whose father had a revenue\r\nof 40,000 piastres, possessed more lands than he could clear; he\r\ndistributed them in the valleys of Aragua among poor families who\r\nchose to apply themselves to the cultivation of cotton. He\r\nendeavoured to surround his ample plantations with freemen, who,\r\nworking as they chose, either in their own land or in the\r\nneighbouring plantations, supplied him with day-labourers at the\r\ntime of harvest. Nobly occupied on the means best adapted gradually\r\nto extinguish the slavery of the blacks in these provinces, Count\r\nTovar flattered himself with the double hope of rendering slaves\r\nless necessary to the landholders, and furnishing the freedmen with\r\nopportunities of becoming farmers. On departing for Europe he had\r\nparcelled out and let a part of the lands of Cura, which extend\r\ntowards the west at the foot of the rock of Las Viruelas. Four\r\nyears after, at his return to America, he found on this spot,\r\nfinely cultivated in cotton, a little hamlet of thirty or forty\r\nhouses, which is called Punta Zamuro, and which we visited with\r\nhim. The inhabitants of this hamlet are almost all mulattos,\r\nZamboes, or free blacks. This example of letting out land has been\r\nhappily followed by several other great proprietors. The rent is\r\nten piastres for a fanega of ground, and is paid in money or in\r\ncotton. As the small farmers are often in want, they sell their\r\ncotton at a very moderate price. They dispose of it even before the\r\nharvest: and the advances, made by rich neighbours, place the\r\ndebtor in a situation of dependence, which frequently obliges him\r\nto offer his services as a labourer. The price of labour is cheaper\r\nhere than in France. A freeman, working as a day-labourer (peon),\r\nis paid in the valleys of Aragua and in the llanos four or five\r\npiastres per month, not including food, which is very cheap on\r\naccount of the abundance of meat and vegetables. I love to dwell on\r\nthese details of colonial industry, because they serve to prove to\r\nthe inhabitants of Europe, a fact which to the enlightened\r\ninhabitants of the colonies has long ceased to be doubtful, namely,\r\nthat the continent of Spanish America can produce sugar, cotton,\r\nand indigo by free hands, and that the unhappy slaves are capable\r\nof becoming peasants, farmers, and landholders.\r\n\r\nEND OF VOLUME 1.",
