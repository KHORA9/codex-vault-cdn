He was so bored with his\r\nown company that the Mentorian medic was a welcome sight when he came to\r\nprepare him for _cold-sleep_.\r\n\r\nThe Mentorian paused, needle in hand. \"Do you wish to be wakened for the\r\ntime we shall spend in each of the three star systems, sir? You can, of\r\ncourse, be given enough drug to keep you in cold-sleep until we reach\r\nyour destination.\"\r\n\r\nBart felt tempted--he wanted very much to see the other star systems.\r\nBut he couldn't risk meeting other passengers.\r\n\r\nThe needle went into his arm. In sudden panic, he realized he was\r\nhelpless. The ship would touch down on three worlds, and on any of them\r\nthe Lhari might have his description, or his alias! He could be taken\r\noff, unconscious, and might never wake up! He tried to move, to protest,\r\nbut he couldn't. There was a freezing moment of intense cold and then\r\nnothing....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ONE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lhari spaceport didn't belong on Earth.\r\n\r\nBart Steele had thought that, a long time ago, when he first saw it. He\r\nhad been just a kid then; twelve years old, and all excited about seeing\r\nEarth for the first time--Earth, the legendary home of mankind before\r\nthe Age of Space, the planet of Bart's far-back ancestors. And the first\r\nthing he'd seen on Earth, when he got off the starship, was the Lhari\r\nspaceport.\r\n\r\nAnd he'd thought, right then, _It doesn't belong on Earth._\r\n\r\nHe'd said so to his father, and his father's face had gone strange,\r\nbitter and remote.\r\n\r\n\"A lot of people would agree with you, Son,\" Captain Rupert Steele had\r\nsaid softly. \"The trouble is, if the Lhari spaceport wasn't on Earth, we\r\nwouldn't be on Earth either. Remember that.\"\r\n\r\nBart remembered it, five years later, as he got off the strip of moving\r\nsidewalk. He turned to wait for Tommy Kendron, who was getting his\r\nbaggage off the center strip of the moving roadway. Bart Steele and\r\nTommy Kendron had graduated together, the day before, from the Space\r\nAcademy of Earth. Now Tommy, who had been born on the ninth planet of\r\nthe star Capella, was taking the Lhari starship to his faraway home, and\r\nBart's father was coming back to Earth, on the same starship, to meet\r\nhis son.\r\n\r\n_Five years,_ Bart thought. _That's a long time. I wonder if Dad will\r\nknow me?_\r\n\r\n\"Let me give you a hand with that stuff, Tommy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can manage,\" Tommy chuckled, hefting the plastic cases. \"They don't\r\nallow you much baggage weight on the Lhari ships. Certainly not more\r\nthan I can handle.\"\r\n\r\nThe two lads stood in front of the spaceport gate for a minute. Over the\r\ngate, which was high and pointed and made of some clear colorless\r\nmaterial like glass, was a jagged symbol resembling a flash of\r\nlightning; the sign, in Lhari language, for the home world of the Lhari.\r\n\r\nThey walked through the pointed glass gate, and stood for a moment, by\r\nmutual consent, looking down over the vast expanse of the Lhari\r\nspaceport.\r\n\r\nThis had once been a great desert. Now it was all floored in with some\r\nstrange substance that was neither glass, metal nor concrete; it looked\r\nlike gleaming crystal--though it felt soft underfoot--and in the glare\r\nof the noonday sun, it gave back the glare in a million rainbow flashes.\r\nTommy put his hands up to his eyes to shield them. \"The Lhari must have\r\nfunny eyes, if they can stand all this glare!\"\r\n\r\nInside the glass gate, a man in a guard's uniform gave them each a pair\r\nof dark glasses. \"Put them on now, boys. And don't look directly at the\r\nship when it lands.\"\r\n\r\nTommy hooked the earpieces of the dark glasses over his ears, and sighed\r\nwith relief. Bart frowned, but finally put them on. Bart's mother had\r\nbeen a Mentorian--from the planet Mentor, of the star Deneb, a hundred\r\ntimes brighter than the sun. Bart had her eyes. But Mentorians weren't\r\npopular on Earth, and Bart had learned to be quiet about his mother.\r\n\r\nThrough the dark lenses, the glare was only a pale gleam. Far out in the\r\nvery center of the spaceport, a high, clear-glass skyscraper rose,\r\ncatching the sunlight in a million colors. Around the building, small\r\ncopters and robotcabs veered, discharging passengers; and the moving\r\nsidewalks were crowded with people coming and going. Here and there in\r\nthe crowd, standing out because of their height and the silvery metallic\r\ncloaks they wore, were the strange tall figures of the Lhari.\r\n\r\n\"Well, how about going down?\" Tommy glanced impatiently at his\r\ntimepiece. \"Less than half an hour before the starship touches down.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right. We can get a sidewalk over here.\" Reluctantly, Bart tore his\r\neyes from the fascinating spectacle, and followed Tommy, stepping onto\r\none of the sidewalks. It bore them down a long, sloping ramp toward the\r\nfloor of the spaceport, then sped toward the glass skyscraper; came to\r\nrest at the wide pointed doors, depositing them in the midst of the\r\ncrowd. The jagged lightning flash was there over the doors of the\r\nbuilding, and the words:\r\n\r\n     HERE, BY THE GRACE OF THE LHARI, IS THE DOORWAY TO ALL THE STARS.\r\n\r\nBart remembered, as if it were yesterday, how he and his father had\r\nfirst passed through this doorway. And his father, looking up, had said\r\nunder his breath \"Not for always, Son. Someday men will have a doorway\r\nto the stars, and the Lhari won't be standing in the door.\"\r\n\r\nInside the building, it was searingly bright. The high open rotunda was\r\nfilled with immense mirrors, and glass ramps running up and down, moving\r\nstaircases, confusing signs and flashing lights on tall oddly shaped\r\npillars. The place was crowded with men from all over the planet, but\r\nthe dark glasses they all wore gave them a strange sort of family\r\nresemblance.\r\n\r\nTommy said, \"I'd better check my reservations.\"\r\n\r\nBart nodded. \"Meet you on the upper level later,\" he said, and got on a\r\nmoving staircase that soared slowly upward, past level after level,\r\ntoward the information desk located on the topmost mezzanine.\r\n\r\nThe staircase moved slowly, and Bart had plenty of time to see\r\neverything. On the step immediately in front of him, two Lhari were\r\nstanding; with their backs turned, they might almost have been men.\r\nUnusually tall, unusually thin, but men. Then Bart amended that\r\nmentally. The Lhari had two arms, two legs and a head apiece--they were\r\nthat much like men. Their faces had two eyes, two ears, and a nose and\r\nmouth, all in the right places. But the similarity ended there.\r\n\r\nThey had skin of a curious pale silvery gray, and pale, pure-white hair\r\nrising in what looked like a feathery crest. The eyes were long and\r\nslanting, the forehead high and narrow, the nose delicately thin and\r\nchiseled with long vertically slit nostrils, the ears long, pointed and\r\nlobeless. The mouth looked almost human, though the chin was abnormally\r\npointed. The hands would almost have passed inspection as human\r\nhands--except for the long, triangular nails curved over the fingertips\r\nlike the claws of a cat. They wore skin-tight clothes of some metallic\r\nsilky stuff, and long flowing gleaming silvery capes. They looked\r\nunearthly, elfin and strange, and in their own way they were beautiful.\r\n\r\nThe two Lhari in front of Bart had been talking softly, in their fast\r\ntwittering speech; but as the hum of the crowds on the upper levels grew\r\nlouder, they raised their voices, and Bart could hear what they were\r\nsaying. He was a little surprised to find that he could still understand\r\nthe Lhari language. He hadn't heard a word of it in years--not since his\r\nMentorian mother died. The Lhari would never guess that he could\r\nunderstand their speech. Not one human in a million could speak or\r\nunderstand a dozen words of Lhari, except the Mentorians.\r\n\r\n\"Do you really think that _human_--\" the first Lhari spoke the word as\r\nif it were a filthy insult--\"will have the temerity to come in by this\r\nship?\"\r\n\r\n\"No reasonable being can tell what _humans_ will do,\" said the second\r\nLhari. \"But then, no reasonable being can tell what our own Port\r\nAuthorities will do either! If the message had only reached us sooner,\r\nit would have been easier. Now I suppose it will have to clear through a\r\ndozen officials and a dozen different kinds of formalities.\"\r\n\r\nThe younger Lhari sounded angry. \"And we have only a description--no\r\nname, nothing! How do they expect us to do anything under those\r\nconditions? What I can't understand is how it ever happened, or how the\r\nman managed to get away. What worries me is the possibility that he may\r\nhave communicated with others we don't know about. Those bungling fools\r\nwho let the first man get away can't even be sure--\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not speak of it here,\" said the old Lhari sharply. \"There are\r\nMentorians in the crowd who might understand us.\" He turned and looked\r\nstraight at Bart, and Bart felt as if the slanted strange eyes were\r\nlooking right through to his bones. The Lhari said, in Universal, \"Who\r\nare you, boy? What iss your businesssses here?\"\r\n\r\nBart replied in the same language, politely, \"My father's coming in on\r\nthis ship. I'm looking for the information desk.\"\r\n\r\n\"Up there,\" said the old Lhari, pointing with a clawed hand, and lost\r\ninterest in Bart. He said to his companion, in their own language,\r\n\"Always, I regret these episodes. I have no malice against humans. I\r\nsuppose even this Vegan that we are seeking has young, and a mate, who\r\nwill regret his loss.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then he should not have pried into Lhari matters,\" said the younger\r\nLhari fiercely. \"If they'd killed him right away--\"\r\n\r\nThe soaring staircase swooped up to the top level; the two Lhari stepped\r\noff and mingled swiftly with the crowd, being lost to sight. Bart\r\nwhistled in dismay as he got off and turned toward the information desk.\r\nA Vegan! Some poor guy from his own planet was in trouble with the\r\nLhari. He felt a cold, crawling chill down his insides. The Lhari had\r\nspoken regretfully, but the way they'd speak of a fly they couldn't\r\nmanage to swat fast enough. Sooner or later you had to get down to it,\r\nthey just weren't human!\r\n\r\nHere on Earth, nothing much could happen, of course. They wouldn't let\r\nthe Lhari hurt anyone--then Bart remembered his course in Universal Law.\r\nThe Lhari spaceport in every system, by treaty, was Lhari territory.\r\nOnce you walked beneath the lightning-flash sign, the authority of the\r\nplanet ceased to function; you might as well be on that unbelievably\r\nremote world in another galaxy that was the Lhari home planet--that\r\nworld no human had ever seen. On a Lhari spaceport, or on a Lhari ship,\r\nyou were under the jurisdiction of Lhari law.\r\n\r\nTommy stepped off a moving stair and joined him. \"The ship's on time--it\r\nreported past Luna City a few minutes ago. I'm thirsty--how about a\r\ndrink?\"\r\n\r\nThere was a refreshment stand on this level; they debated briefly\r\nbetween orange juice and a drink with a Lhari name that meant simply\r\n_cold sweet_, and finally decided to try it. The name proved\r\ndescriptive; it was very cold, very sweet and indescribably delicious.\r\n\r\n\"Does this come from the Lhari world, I wonder?\"\r\n\r\n\"I imagine it's synthetic,\" Bart said.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose it won't _hurt_ us?\"\r\n\r\nBart laughed. \"They wouldn't serve it to us if it would. No, men and\r\nLhari are alike in a lot of ways. They breathe the same air. Eat about\r\nthe same food.\" Their bodies were adjusted to about the same gravity.\r\nThey had the same body chemistry--in fact, you couldn't tell Lhari blood\r\nfrom human, even under a microscope. And in the terrible Orion Spaceport\r\nwreck sixty years ago, doctors had found that blood plasma from humans\r\ncould be used for wounded Lhari, and vice versa, though it wasn't safe\r\nto transfuse whole blood. But then, even among humans there were five\r\nblood types.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, for all their likeness, they were _different_.\r\n\r\nBart sipped the cold Lhari drink, seeing himself in the mirror behind\r\nthe refreshment stand; a tall teen-ager, looking older than his\r\nseventeen years. He was lithe and well muscled from five years of sports\r\nand acrobatics at the Space Academy, he had curling red hair and gray\r\neyes, and he was almost as tall as a Lhari.\r\n\r\n_Will Dad know me? I was just a little kid when he left me here, and now\r\nI'm grown-up._\r\n\r\nTommy grinned at him in the mirror. \"What are you going to do, now we've\r\nfinished our so-called education?\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you think? Go back to Vega with Dad, by Lhari ship, and help\r\nhim run Vega Interplanet. Why else would I bother with all that\r\nastrogation and math?\"\r\n\r\n\"You're the lucky one, with your father owning a dozen ships! He must be\r\nalmost as rich as the Lhari.\"\r\n\r\nBart shook his head. \"It's not that easy. Space travel inside a system\r\nthese days is small stuff; all the real travel and shipping goes to the\r\nLhari ships.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a sore point with everyone. Thousands of years ago, men had\r\nspread out from Earth--first to the planets, then to the nearer stars,\r\ncrawling in ships that could travel no faster than the speed of light.\r\nThey had even believed that was an absolute limit--that nothing in the\r\nuniverse could exceed the speed of light. It took years to go from Earth\r\nto the nearest star.\r\n\r\nBut they'd done it. From the nearer stars, they had sent out colonizing\r\nships all through the galaxy. Some vanished and were never heard from\r\nagain, but some made it, and in a few centuries man had spread all over\r\nhundreds of star-systems.\r\n\r\nAnd then man met the people of the Lhari.\r\n\r\nIt was a big universe, with measureless millions of stars, and plenty of\r\nroom for more than two intelligent civilizations. It wasn't surprising\r\nthat the Lhari, who had only been traveling space for a couple of\r\nthousand years themselves, had never come across humans before. But they\r\nhad been delighted to meet another intelligent race--and it was\r\nextremely profitable.\r\n\r\nBecause men were still held, mostly, to the planets of their own\r\nstar-systems. Ships traveling between the stars by light-drive were rare\r\nand ruinously expensive. But the Lhari had the warp-drive, and almost\r\novernight the whole picture changed. By warp-drive, hundreds of times\r\nfaster than light at peak, the years-long trip between Vega and Earth,\r\nfor instance, was reduced to about three months, at a price anyone could\r\npay. Mankind could trade and travel all over their galaxy, but they did\r\nit on Lhari ships. The Lhari had an absolute, unbreakable monopoly on\r\nstar travel.\r\n\r\n\"That's what hurts,\" Tommy said. \"It wouldn't do us any good to have the\r\nstar-drive. Humans can't stand faster-than-light travel, except in\r\ncold-sleep.\"\r\n\r\nBart nodded. The Lhari ships traveled at normal speeds, like the regular\r\nplanetary ships, inside each star-system. Then, at the borders of the\r\nvast gulf of emptiness between stars, they went into warp-drive; but\r\nfirst, every human on board was given the cold-sleep treatment that\r\nplaced them in suspended animation, allowing their bodies to endure the\r\nwarp-drive.\r\n\r\nHe finished his drink. The increasing bustle in the crowds below them\r\ntold him that time must be getting short. A tall, impressive-looking\r\nLhari strode through the crowd, followed at a respectful distance by two\r\nMentorians, tall, redheaded humans wearing metallic cloaks like those of\r\nthe Lhari. Tommy nudged Bart, his face bitter.\r\n\r\n\"Look at those lousy Mentorians! How can they do it? Fawning upon the\r\nLhari that way, yet they're as human as we are! _Slaves_ of the Lhari!\"\r\n\r\nBart felt the involuntary surge of anger, instantly controlled. \"It's\r\nnot that way at all. My mother was a Mentorian, remember. She made five\r\ncruises on a Lhari ship before she married my father.\"\r\n\r\nTommy sighed. \"I guess I'm just jealous--to think the Mentorians can\r\nsign on the Lhari ship as crew, while you and I will never pilot a ship\r\nbetween the stars. What did she do?\"\r\n\r\n\"She was a mathematician. Before the Lhari met up with men, they used a\r\nsystem of mathematics as clumsy as the old Roman numerals. You have to\r\nadmire them, when you realize that they learned stellar navigation with\r\ntheir old system, though most ships use human math now. And of course,\r\nyou know their eyes aren't like ours. Among other things, they're\r\ncolor-blind. They see everything in shades of black or white or gray.\r\n\r\n\"So they found out that humans aboard their ships were useful. You\r\nremember how humans, in the early days in space, used certain birds, who\r\nwere more sensitive to impure air than they were. When the birds keeled\r\nover, they could tell it was time for humans to start looking over the\r\nair systems! The Lhari use Mentorians to identify colors for them. And,\r\nsince Mentor was the first planet of humans that the Lhari had contact\r\nwith, they've always been closer to them.\"\r\n\r\nTommy looked after the two Mentorians enviously. \"The fact is, I'd ship\r\nout with the Lhari myself if I could. Wouldn't you?\"\r\n\r\nBart's mouth twisted in a wry smile. \"No,\" he said. \"I could--I'm half\r\nMentorian, I can even speak Lhari.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you? I would.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, you wouldn't,\" Bart said softly. \"Not even very many Mentorians\r\nwill. You see, the Lhari don't trust humans too much. In the early days,\r\nmen were always planting spies on Lhari ships, to try and steal the\r\nsecret of warp-drive. They never managed it, but nowadays the Lhari give\r\nall the Mentorians what amounts to a brainwashing--deep hypnosis, before\r\nand after every voyage, so that they can neither look for anything that\r\nmight threaten the Lhari monopoly of space, nor reveal it--even under a\r\ntruth drug--if they find it out.\r\n\r\n\"You have to be pretty fanatical about space travel to go through that.\r\nOh, my mother could tell us a lot of things about her cruises with the\r\nLhari. The Lhari can't tell a diamond from a ruby, except by\r\nspectrographic analysis, for instance. And she--\"\r\n\r\nA high gong note sounded somewhere, touching off an explosion of warning\r\nbells and buzzers all over the enormous building. Bart looked up.\r\n\r\n\"The ship must be coming in to land.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd better check into the passenger side,\" Tommy said. He stuck out his\r\nhand. \"Well, Bart, I guess this is where we say good-bye.\"\r\n\r\nThey shook hands, their eyes meeting for a moment in honest grief. In\r\nsome indefinable way, this parting marked the end of their boyhood.\r\n\r\n\"Good luck, Tom. I'm going to miss you.\"\r\n\r\nThey wrung each other's hands again, hard. Then Tommy picked up his\r\nluggage and started down a sloping ramp toward an enclosure marked TO\r\nPASSENGER ENTRANCE.\r\n\r\nWarning bells rang again. The glare intensified until the glow in the\r\nsky was unendurable, but Bart looked anyhow, making out the strange\r\nshape of the Lhari ship from the stars.\r\n\r\nIt was huge and strange, glowing with colors Bart had never seen before.\r\nIt settled down slowly, softly: enormous, silent, vibrating, glowing;\r\nthen swiftly faded to white-hot, gleaming blue, dulling down through the\r\nvisible spectrum to red. At last it was just gleaming glassy Lhari-metal\r\ncolor again. High up in the ship's side a yawning gap slid open,\r\nextruding stairsteps, and men and Lhari began to descend.\r\n\r\nBart ran down a ramp and surged out on the field with the crowd. His\r\neyes, alert for his father's tall figure, noted with surprise that the\r\nship's stairs were guarded by four cloaked Lhari, each with a Mentorian\r\ninterpreter. They were stopping each person who got off the starship,\r\nasking for identity papers. Bart realized he was seeing another segment\r\nof the same drama he had overheard discussed, and wished he knew what it\r\nwas all about.\r\n\r\nThe crowd was thinning now. Robotcabs were swerving in, hovering above\r\nthe ground to pick up passengers, then veering away. The gap in the\r\nstarship's side was closing, and still Bart had not seen the tall, slim,\r\nflame-haired figure of his father. The port on the other side of the\r\nship, he knew, was for loading passengers. Bart moved carefully through\r\nthe thinning crowd, almost to the foot of the stairs. One of the Lhari\r\nchecking papers stopped and fixed him with an inscrutable gray stare,\r\nbut finally turned away again.\r\n\r\nBart began really to worry. Captain Steele would never miss his ship!\r\nBut he saw only one disembarking passenger who had not yet been\r\nsurrounded by a group of welcoming relatives, or summoned a robotcab and\r\ngone. The man was wearing Vegan clothes, but he wasn't Bart's father. He\r\nwas a fat little man, with ruddy cheeks and a fringe of curling gray\r\nhair all around his bald dome. _Maybe he'd know if there was another\r\nVegan on the ship._\r\n\r\nThen Bart realized that the little fat man was staring straight at him.\r\nHe returned the man's smile, rather hesitantly; then blinked, for the\r\nfat man was coming straight toward him.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Son,\" the fat man said loudly. Then, as two of the Lhari started\r\ntoward him, the strange man did an incredible thing. He reached out his\r\ntwo hands and grabbed Bart.\r\n\r\n\"Well, boy, you've sure grown,\" he said, in a loud, cheerful voice, \"but\r\nyou're not too grown-up to give your old Dad a good hug, are you?\" He\r\npulled Bart roughly into his arms. Bart started to pull away and stammer\r\nthat the fat man had made a mistake, but the pudgy hand gripped his\r\nwrist with unexpected strength.\r\n\r\n\"Bart, listen to me,\" the stranger whispered, in a harsh fast voice. \"Go\r\nalong with this or we're both dead. See those two Lhari watching us?\r\nCall me Dad, good and loud, if you want to live. Because, believe me,\r\nyour life's in danger--right now!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWO\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a moment, pulled off balance in the fat stranger's hug, Bart\r\nremained perfectly still, while the man repeated in that loud, jovial\r\nvoice, \"How you've grown!\" He let him go, stepping away a pace or two,\r\nand whispered urgently, \"Say something. And take that stupid look off\r\nyour face.\"\r\n\r\nAs he stepped back, Bart saw his eyes. In the chubby, good-natured red\r\nface, the stranger's eyes were half-mad with fear.\r\n\r\nIn a split second, Bart remembered the two Lhari and their talk of a\r\nfugitive. In that moment, Bart Steele grew up.\r\n\r\nHe stepped toward the man and took him quickly by the shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"Dad, you sure surprised me,\" he said, trying to keep his voice from\r\nshaking. \"Been such a long time, I'd--half forgotten what you looked\r\nlike. Have a good trip?\"\r\n\r\n\"About like always.\" The fat man was breathing hard, but his voice\r\nsounded firm and cheerful. \"Can't compare with a trip on the old\r\n_Asterion_ though.\" The _Asterion_ was the flagship of Vega Interplanet,\r\nRupert Steele's own ship. \"How's everything?\"\r\n\r\nBeads of sweat were standing out on the man's ruddy forehead, and his\r\ngrip on Bart's wrist was so hard it hurt. Bart, grasping at random for\r\nsomething to say, gabbled, \"Too bad you couldn't get to my graduation. I\r\nmade th-third in a class of four hundred--\"\r\n\r\nThe Lhari had surrounded them and were closing in.\r\n\r\nThe fat man took a deep breath or two, said, \"Just a minute, Son,\" and\r\nturned around. \"You want something?\"\r\n\r\nThe tallest of the Lhari--the old one, whom Bart had seen on the\r\nescalator--looked long and hard at him. When they spoke Universal, their\r\nvoices were sibilant, but not nearly so inhuman.\r\n\r\n\"Could we trrrouble you to sssshow us your paperrrssss?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly.\" Nonchalantly, the fat man dug them out and handed them\r\nover. Bart saw his father's name printed across the top.\r\n\r\nThe Lhari gestured to a Mentorian interpreter: \"What colorrr isss thisss\r\nman's hairrr?\"\r\n\r\nThe Mentorian said in the Lhari language, \"His hair is _gray_.\" He used\r\nthe Universal word; there were, of course, no words for colors in the\r\nLhari speech.\r\n\r\n\"The man we sssseek has hair of _red_,\" said the Lhari. \"And he isss\r\ntall, not fat.\"\r\n\r\n\"The boy is tall and with _red_ hair,\" the Mentorian volunteered, and\r\nthe old Lhari made a gesture of disdain.\r\n\r\n\"This boy is twenty years younger than the man whose description came to\r\nus. Why did they not give us a picture or at least a name?\" He turned to\r\nthe other Lhari and said in their own shrill speech, \"I suspected this\r\nman because he was alone. And I had seen this boy on the upper mezzanine\r\nand spoken with him. We watched him, knowing sooner or later the father\r\nwould seek him. Ask him.\" He gestured and the Mentorian said, \"Who is\r\nthis man, you?\"\r\n\r\nBart gulped. For the first time he noted the energon-ray shockers at the\r\nbelts of the four Lhari. He'd heard about those. They could stun--or\r\nthey could kill, and quite horribly. He said, \"This is my father. You\r\nwant my cards, too?\" He hauled out his identity papers. \"My name's Bart\r\nSteele.\"\r\n\r\nThe Lhari, with a gesture of disgust, handed them back. \"Go, then,\r\nfather and son,\" he said, not unkindly.\r\n\r\n\"Let's get going, Son,\" said the little bald man. His hand shook on\r\nBart's, and Bart thought, _If we're lucky, we can get out of the port\r\nbefore he faints dead away._ He said \"I'll get a copter,\" and then,\r\nfeeling sorry for the stranger, gave him his arm to lean on. He didn't\r\nknow whether he was worried or scared. _Where was his father?_ Why did\r\nthis man have his dad's papers? Was his father hiding inside the Lhari\r\nship? He wanted to run, to burst away from the imposter, but the guy was\r\nshaking so hard Bart couldn't just leave him standing there. If the\r\nLhari got him, he was a dead duck.\r\n\r\nA copter swooped down, the pilot signaling. The little man said\r\nhoarsely, \"No. Robotcab.\"\r\n\r\nBart waved the copter away, getting a dirty look from the pilot, and\r\npunched a button at the stand for one of the unmanned robotcabs. It\r\nswung down, hovered motionless. Bart boosted the fat man in. Inside, the\r\nman collapsed on the seat, leaning back, puffing, his hand pressed hard\r\nto his chest.\r\n\r\n\"Punch a combo for Denver,\" he said hoarsely.\r\n\r\nBart obeyed, automatically. Then he turned on the man.\r\n\r\n\"It's your game, mister! Now tell me what's going on? _Where's my\r\nfather?_\"\r\n\r\nThe man's eyes were half-shut. He said, gasping, \"Don't ask me any\r\nquestions for a minute.\" He thumbed a tablet into his mouth, and\r\npresently his breathing quieted.\r\n\r\n\"We're safe--for the minute. Those Lhari would have cut us down.\"\r\n\r\n\"You, maybe. I haven't done anything. Look, you,\" Bart said in sudden\r\nrage, \"you owe me some explanations. For all I know, you're a criminal\r\nand the Lhari have every right to chase you! Why have you got my\r\nfather's papers? Did you steal them to get away from the Lhari? _Where's\r\nmy father?_\"\r\n\r\n\"It's your father they were looking for, you young fool,\" said the man,\r\ngasping hard. \"Lucky they had only a description and not a name--but\r\nthey've probably got that by now, uncoded. We've only confused them for\r\na little while. But if you hadn't played along, they'd have had you\r\nwatched, and when they get hold of the name Steele--they will, sooner or\r\nlater, the people in the Procyon system--\"\r\n\r\n_\"Where is my father?\"_\r\n\r\n\"I hope I don't know,\" the fat man said. \"If he's still where I left\r\nhim, he's dead. My name is Briscoe. Edmund Briscoe. Your father saved my\r\nlife years ago, never mind how. The less you know, the safer you'll be\r\nfor a while. His major worry just now is about you. He was afraid, if he\r\ndidn't turn up here, you'd take the first ship back to Vega. So he gave\r\nme his papers and sent me to warn you--\"\r\n\r\nBart shook his head. \"It all sounds phony as can be. How do I know\r\nwhether to believe you or not?\" His hand hovered over the robotcab\r\ncontrols. \"We're going straight to the police. If you're okay, they\r\nwon't turn you over to the Lhari. If you're not--\"\r\n\r\n\"You young fool,\" said the fat man, with feeble violence, \"there's no\r\n_time_ for all that! Ask me questions--I can prove I know your father!\"\r\n\r\n\"What was my mother's name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, God,\" Briscoe said, \"I never saw her. I knew your father long\r\nbefore you were born. Until he told me, I never knew he'd married or\r\nhad a son. I'd never have known you, except that you're the living\r\nimage--\" He shook his head helplessly, and his breathing sounded hoarse.\r\n\r\n\"Bart, I'm a sick man, I'm going to die. I want to do what I came here\r\nto do, because your father saved my life once when I was young and\r\nhealthy, and gave me twenty good years before I got old and fat and\r\nsick. Win or lose, I won't live to see you hunted down like a dog, like\r\nmy own son--\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't talk like that,\" Bart said, a creepy feeling coming over him. \"If\r\nyou're sick, let me take you to a doctor.\"\r\n\r\nBriscoe did not even hear. \"Wait, there is something else. Your father\r\nsaid, 'Tell Bart I've gone looking for the Eighth Color. Bart will know\r\nwhat I mean.'\"\r\n\r\n\"That's crazy. I don't know--\"\r\n\r\nHe broke off, for the memory had come, full-blown:\r\n\r\n_He was very young: five, six, seven. His mother, tall and slender and\r\nvery fair, was bending over a blueprint, pointing with a delicate finger\r\nat something, straightening, saying in her light musical voice:_\r\n\r\n_\"The fuel catalyst--it's a strange color, a color you never saw\r\nanywhere. Can you_ think _of a color that isn't red, orange, yellow,\r\ngreen, blue, violet, indigo or some combination of them? It isn't any of\r\nthe colors of the spectrum at all. The fuel is a real eighth color.\"_\r\n\r\n_And his father had used the phrase, almost adopted it. \"When we know\r\nwhat the eighth color is, we'll have the secret of the star-drive,\r\ntoo!\"_\r\n\r\nBriscoe saw his face change, nodded weakly. \"I see it means something to\r\nyou. Now will you do as I tell you? Within a couple of hours, they'll be\r\ncombing the planet for you, but by that time the ship I came in on will\r\nhave taken off again. They only stop a short time here, for mail,\r\npassengers--no cargo. They may get under way again before all messages\r\nare cleared and decoded.\" He stopped and breathed hard. \"The Earth\r\nauthorities might protect you, but you would never be able to board a\r\nLhari ship again--and that would mean staying on Earth for the rest of\r\nyour life. You've got to get away before they start comparing notes.\r\nHere.\" His hand went into his pockets. \"For your hair. It's a dye--a\r\nspray.\"\r\n\r\nHe pressed a button on the bulb in his hand; Bart gasped, feeling cold\r\nwetness on his head. His own hand came away stained black.\r\n\r\n\"Keep still.\" Briscoe said irritably. \"You'll need it at the Procyon end\r\nof the run. Here.\" He stuck some papers into Bart's hand, then punched\r\nsome buttons on the robotcab's control. It wheeled and swerved so\r\nrapidly that Bart fell against the fat man's shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Are you crazy? What are you going to do?\"\r\n\r\nBriscoe looked straight into Bart's eyes. In his hoarse, sick voice, he\r\nsaid, \"Bart, don't worry about me. It's all over for me, whatever\r\nhappens. Just remember this. What your father is doing is _worth_ doing,\r\nand if you start stalling, arguing, demanding explanations, you can foul\r\nup a hundred people--and kill about half of them.\"\r\n\r\nHe closed Bart's fingers roughly over the papers. The robotcab hovered\r\nover the spaceport. \"Now listen to me, very carefully. When I stop the\r\ncab, down below, jump out. Don't stop to say good-bye, or ask questions,\r\nor anything else. Just get out, walk straight through the passenger door\r\nand straight up the ramp of the ship. Show them that ticket, and get on.\r\nWhatever happens, don't let anything stop you. Bart!\" Briscoe shook his\r\nshoulder. \"Promise! Whatever happens, you'll _get on that ship_!\"\r\n\r\nBart swallowed, feeling as if he'd been shoved into a silly\r\ncops-and-robbers game. But Briscoe's urgency had convinced him. \"Where\r\nam I going?\"\r\n\r\n\"All I have is a name--Raynor Three,\" Briscoe said, \"and the message\r\nabout the Eighth Color. That's all I know.\" His mouth twisted again in\r\nthat painful gasp.\r\n\r\nThe cab swooped down. Bart found his voice. \"But what then? Is Dad\r\nthere? Will I know--\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know any more than I've told you,\" Briscoe said. Abruptly the\r\nrobotcab came to a halt, swaying a little. Briscoe jerked the door open,\r\ngave Bart a push, and Bart found himself stumbling out on the ramp\r\nbeside the spaceport building. He caught his balance, looked around, and\r\nrealized that the robotcab was already climbing the sky again.\r\n\r\nImmediately before him, neon letters spelled TO PASSENGER ENTRANCE\r\nONLY. Bart stumbled forward. The Lhari by the gate thrust out a\r\ndisinterested claw. Bart held up what Briscoe had shoved into his hand,\r\nonly now seeing that it was a thin wallet, a set of identity papers and a\r\nstrip of pink tickets.\r\n\r\n\"Procyon Alpha. Corridor B, straight through.\" The Lhari gestured, and\r\nBart went through the narrow passageway, came out at the other end, and\r\nfound himself at the very base of a curving stair that led up and up\r\ntoward a door in the side of the huge Lhari ship. Bart hesitated. In\r\nanother minute he'd be on his way to a strange sun and a strange world,\r\non what might well be the wild-goose chase of all time.\r\n\r\nPassengers were crowding the steps behind him. Someone shouted suddenly,\r\n\"Look at that!\" and someone else yelled, \"Is that guy crazy?\"\r\n\r\nBart looked up. A robotcab was swooping over the spaceport in wild,\r\ncrazy circles, dipping down, suddenly making a dart like an enraged wasp\r\nat a little nest of Lhari. They ducked and scattered; the robotcab\r\nswerved away, hovered, swooped back. This time it struck one of the\r\nLhari grazingly with landing gear and knocked him sprawling. Bart stood\r\nwith his mouth open, as if paralyzed.\r\n\r\n_Briscoe! What was he doing?_\r\n\r\nThe fallen Lhari lay without moving. The robotcab moved in again, as if\r\nfor the kill, buzzing viciously overhead.\r\n\r\nThen a beam of light arced from one of the drawn energon-ray tubes. The\r\nrobotcab glowed briefly red, then seemed to sag, sink together; then\r\npuddled, a slag heap of molten metal, on the glassy floor of the port. A\r\nlittle moan of horror came from the crowd, and Bart felt a sudden,\r\nwrenching sickness. It had been like a game, a silly game of cops and\r\nrobbers, and suddenly it was as serious as melted death lying there on\r\nthe spaceport. _Briscoe!_\r\n\r\nSomeone shoved him and said, \"Come on, quit gawking, kid. They won't\r\nhold the ship all day just because some nut finds a new way to commit\r\nsuicide.\"\r\n\r\nBart, his legs numb, walked up the ramp. Briscoe had died to give him\r\nthis chance. Now it was up to him to make it worth having.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THREE\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the top of the ramp, a Lhari glanced briefly at his papers, motioned\r\nhim through. Bart passed through the airlock, and into a brightly lit\r\ncorridor half full of passengers. The line was moving slowly, and for\r\nthe first time Bart had a chance to think.\r\n\r\nHe had never seen violent death before. In this civilized world, you\r\ndidn't. He knew if he thought about Briscoe, he'd start bawling like a\r\nbaby, so he swallowed hard a couple of times, set his chin, and\r\nconcentrated on the trip to Procyon Alpha. That meant this ship was\r\noutbound on the Aldebaran run--Proxima Centauri, Sirius, Pollux,\r\nProcyon, Capella and Aldebaran.\r\n\r\nThe line of passengers was disappearing through a doorway. A woman ahead\r\nof Bart turned and said nervously, \"We won't be put into cold-sleep\r\nright away, will we?\"\r\n\r\nHe reassured her, remembering his inbound trip five years ago. \"No, no.\r\nThe ship won't go into warp-drive until we're well past Pluto. It will\r\nbe several days, at least.\"\r\n\r\nBeyond the doorway the lights dwindled, and a Mentorian interpreter took\r\nhis dark glasses, saying, \"Kindly remove your belt, shoes and other\r\naccessories of leather or metal before stepping into the decontamination\r\nchamber. They will be separately decontaminated and returned to you.\r\nPapers, please.\"\r\n\r\nWith a small twinge of fright, Bart surrendered them. Would the\r\nMentorian ask why he was carrying two wallets? Inside the other one, he\r\nstill had his Academy ID card which identified him as Bart Steele, and\r\nif the Mentorian looked through them to check, and found out he was\r\ncarrying two sets of identity papers....\r\n\r\nBut the Mentorian merely dumped all his pocket paraphernalia, without\r\nlooking at it, into a sack. \"Just step through here.\"\r\n\r\nHolding up his trousers with both hands, Bart stepped inside the\r\nindicated cubicle. It was filled with faint bluish light. Bart felt a\r\nstrong tingling and a faint electrical smell, and along his forearms\r\nthere was a slight prickling where the small hairs were all standing on\r\nend. He knew that the invisible R-rays were killing all the\r\nmicroorganisms in his body, so that no disease germ or stray fungus\r\nwould be carried from planet to planet.\r\n\r\nThe bluish light died. Outside, the Mentorian gave him back his shoes\r\nand belt, handed him the paper sack of his belongings, and a paper cup\r\nfull of greenish fluid.\r\n\r\n\"Drink this.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\"\r\n\r\nThe medic said patiently, \"Remember, the R-rays killed _all_ the\r\nmicroorganisms in your body, including the good ones--the antibodies\r\nthat protect you against disease, and the small yeasts and bacteria that\r\nlive in your intestines and help in the digestion of your food. So we\r\nhave to replace those you need to stay healthy. See?\"\r\n\r\nThe green stuff tasted a little brackish, but Bart got it down all\r\nright. He didn't much like the idea of drinking a solution of \"germs,\"\r\nbut he knew that was silly. There was a big difference between disease\r\ngerms and helpful bacteria.\r\n\r\nAnother Mentorian official, this one a young woman, gave him a key with\r\na numbered tag, and a small booklet with WELCOME ABOARD printed\r\non the cover.\r\n\r\nThe tag was numbered 246-B, which made Bart raise his eyebrows. B class\r\nwas normally too expensive for Bart's father's modest purse. It wasn't\r\nquite the luxury class A, reserved for planetary governors and\r\nambassadors, but it was plenty luxurious. Briscoe had certainly sent him\r\ntraveling in style!\r\n\r\nB Deck was a long corridor with oval doors; Bart found one numbered 246,\r\nand, not surprisingly, the key opened it. It was a pleasant little\r\ncabin, measuring at least six feet by eight, and he would evidently have\r\nit to himself. There was a comfortably big bunk, a light that could be\r\nturned on and off instead of the permanent glow-walls of the cheaper\r\nclass, a private shower and toilet, and a placard on the walls informing\r\nhim that passengers in B class had the freedom of the Observation Dome\r\nand the Recreation Lounge. There was even a row of buttons dispensing\r\nsynthetic foods, in case a passenger preferred privacy or didn't want to\r\nwait for meals in the dining hall.\r\n\r\nA buzzer sounded and a Mentorian voice announced, \"Five minutes to Room\r\nCheck. Passengers will please remove all metal in their clothing, and\r\ndeposit in the lead drawers. Passengers will please recline in their\r\nbunks and fasten the retaining straps before the steward arrives.\r\nRepeat, passengers will please....\"\r\n\r\nBart took off his belt, stuck it and his cuff links in the drawer and\r\nlay down. Then, in a sudden panic, he got up again. His papers as Bart\r\nSteele were still in the sack. He got them out, and with a feeling as if\r\nhe were crossing a bridge and burning it after him, tore up every scrap\r\nof paper that identified him as Bart Steele of Vega Four, graduate of\r\nthe Space Academy of Earth. Now, for better or worse, he was--who _was_\r\nhe? He hadn't even looked at the new papers Briscoe had given him!\r\n\r\nHe glanced through them quickly. They were made out to David Warren\r\nBriscoe, of Aldebaran Four. According to them, David Briscoe was twenty\r\nyears old, hair black, eyes hazel, height six foot one inch. Bart\r\nwondered, painfully, if Briscoe had a son and if David Briscoe knew\r\nwhere his father was. There was also a license, validated with four runs\r\non the Aldebaran Intrasatellite Cargo Company--planetary ships--with the\r\nrank of Apprentice Astrogator; and a considerable sum of money.\r\n\r\nBart put the papers in his pants pocket and the torn-up scraps of his\r\nold ones into the trashbin before he realized that they looked exactly\r\nlike what they were--torn-up legal identity papers and a broken plastic\r\ncard. _Nobody_ destroyed identity papers for any good reason. What could\r\nhe do?\r\n\r\nThen he remembered something from the Academy. Starships were\r\nclosed-system cycles, no waste was discarded, but everything was\r\ncollected in big chemical tanks, broken down to separate elements,\r\npurified and built up again into new materials. He threw the paper into\r\nthe toilet, worked the plastic card back and forth, back and forth until\r\nhe had wrenched it into inch-wide bits, and threw it after them.\r\n\r\nThe cabin door opened and a Mentorian said irritably, \"Please lie down\r\nand fasten your straps. I haven't all day.\"\r\n\r\nHastily Bart flushed the toilet and went to the bunk. Now everything\r\nthat could identify him as Bart Steele was on its way to the breakdown\r\ntanks. Before long, the complex hydrocarbons and cellulose would all be\r\ninnocent little molecules of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen; they might turn\r\nup in new combinations as sugar on the table!\r\n\r\nThe Mentorian grumbled, \"You young people think the rules mean everybody\r\nbut you,\" and strapped him far too tightly into the bunk. Bart felt\r\nresentful; just because Mentorians could work on Lhari ships, did they\r\nhave to act as if they owned everybody?\r\n\r\nWhen the man had gone, Bart drew a deep breath. Was he really doing the\r\nright thing?\r\n\r\nIf he'd refused to get out of the robotcab--\r\n\r\nIf he'd driven Briscoe straight to the police--\r\n\r\nThen maybe Briscoe would still be alive. And now it was too late.\r\n\r\nA warning siren went off in the ship, rising to hysterical intensity.\r\nBart thought, incredulously, _this is really happening_. It felt like a\r\nnightmare. His father a fugitive from the Lhari. Briscoe dead. He\r\nhimself traveling, with forged papers, to a star he'd never seen.\r\n\r\nHe braced himself, knowing the siren was the last warning before\r\ntakeoff. First there would be the hum of great turbines deep in the\r\nship, then the crushing surge of acceleration. He had made a dozen trips\r\ninside the solar system, but no matter how often he did it, there was\r\nthe strange excitement, the little pinpoint of fear, like an exotic\r\ntaste, that was almost pleasant.\r\n\r\nThe door opened and Bart grabbed a fistful of bed-ticking as two Lhari\r\ncame into the room.\r\n\r\nOne of them said, in their strange shrill speech, \"This boy is the right\r\nage.\"\r\n\r\nBart froze.\r\n\r\n\"You're seeing spies in every corner, Ransell,\" said the other, then in\r\nUniversal, \"Could we trrouble you for your paperesses, sirr?\"\r\n\r\nBart, strapped down and helpless, moved his head toward the drawer,\r\nhoping his face did not betray his fear. He watched the two Lhari riffle\r\nthrough his papers with their odd pointed claws.\r\n\r\n\"What isss your planet?\"\r\n\r\nBart bit his lip, hard--he had almost said, \"Vega Four.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aldebaran Four.\"\r\n\r\nThe Lhari said in his own language, \"We should have Margil in here. He\r\nactually saw them.\"\r\n\r\nThe other replied, \"But I saw the machine that disintegrated. I still\r\nsay there was enough protoplasm residue for two bodies.\"\r\n\r\nBart fought to keep his face perfectly straight.\r\n\r\n\"Did anyone come into your cabin?\" The Lhari asked in Universal.\r\n\r\n\"Only the steward. Why? Is something wrong?\"\r\n\r\n\"There iss some thought that a stowaway might be on boarrd. Of courrrse\r\nwe could not allow that, anyone not prrroperly prrotected would die in\r\nthe first shift into warp-drive.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just the steward,\" Bart said again. \"A Mentorian.\"\r\n\r\nThe Lhari said, eying him keenly, \"You are ill? Or discommoded?\"\r\n\r\nBart grasped at random for an excuse. \"That--that stuff the medic made\r\nme drink made me feel--sort of sick.\"\r\n\r\n\"You may send for a medical officer after acceleration,\" said the Lhari\r\nexpressionlessly. \"The summoning bell is at your left.\"\r\n\r\nThey turned and went out and Bart gulped. Lhari, in person, checking the\r\npassenger decks! Normally you never saw one on board; just Mentorians.\r\nThe Lhari treated humans as if they were too dumb to bother about. Well,\r\nat least for once someone was acting as if humans were worthy\r\nantagonists. _We'll show them--someday!_\r\n\r\nBut he felt very alone, and scared....\r\n\r\nA low hum rose, somewhere in the ship, and Bart grabbed ticking as he\r\nfelt the slow surge. Then a violent sense of pressure popped his ear\r\ndrums, weight crowded down on him like an elephant sitting on his chest,\r\nand there was a horrible squashed sensation dragging his limbs out of\r\nshape. It grew and grew. Bart lay still and sweated, trying to ease his\r\nuncomfortable position, unable to move so much as a finger. The Lhari\r\nships hit 12 gravities in the first surge of acceleration. Bart felt as\r\nif he were spreading out, under the weight, into a puddle of\r\nflesh--_melted flesh like Briscoe's_--\r\n\r\nBart writhed and bit his lip till he could taste blood, wishing he were\r\nyoung enough to bawl out loud.\r\n\r\nAbruptly, it eased, and the blood started to flow again in his numbed\r\nlimbs. Bart loosened his straps, took a few deep breaths, wiped his\r\nface--wringing wet, whether with sweat or tears he wasn't sure--and sat\r\nup in his bunk. The loudspeaker announced, \"Acceleration One is\r\ncompleted. Passengers on A and B Decks are invited to witness the\r\npassing of the Satellites from the Observation Lounge in half an hour.\"\r\n\r\nBart got up and washed his face, remembering that he had no luggage with\r\nhim, not so much as a toothbrush.\r\n\r\nAt the back of his mind, packed up in a corner, was the continuing worry\r\nabout his father, the horror at Briscoe's ghastly death, the fear of the\r\nLhari; but he slammed the lid firmly on them all. For the moment he was\r\nsafe. They might be looking for Bart Steele by now, but they weren't\r\nlooking for David Briscoe of Aldebaran. He might just as well relax and\r\nenjoy the trip. He went down to the Observation Lounge.\r\n\r\nIt had been darkened, and one whole wall of the room was made of clear\r\nquartzite. Bart drew a deep breath as the vast panorama of space opened\r\nout before him.\r\n\r\nThey were receding from the sun at some thousands of miles a minute.\r\nSwirling past the ship, gleaming in the reflected sunlight like iron\r\nfilings moving to the motion of a magnet, were the waves upon waves of\r\ncosmic dust--tiny free electrons, ions, particles of gas; free of the\r\nheavier atmosphere, themselves invisible, they formed in their billions\r\ninto bright clouds around the ship; pale, swirling veils of mist. And\r\nthrough their dim shine, the brilliant flares of the fixed stars burned\r\nclear and steady, so far away that even the hurling motion of the ship\r\ncould not change their positions.\r\n\r\nOne by one he picked out the constellations. Aldebaran swung on the\r\npendant chain of Taurus like a giant ruby. Orion strode across the sky,\r\na swirling nebula at his belt. Vega burned, cobalt blue, in the heart of\r\nthe Lyre.\r\n\r\nColors, colors! Inside the atmosphere of Earth's night, the stars had\r\nbeen pale white sparks against black. Here, against the misty-pale\r\nswirls of cosmic dust, they burned with color heaped on color; the\r\nbloody burning crimson of Antares, the metallic gold of Capella, the\r\nsullen pulsing of Betelgeuse. They burned, each with its own inward\r\nflame and light, like handfuls of burning jewels flung by some giant\r\nhand upon the swirling darkness. It was a sight Bart felt he could watch\r\nforever and still be hungry to see; the never-changing, ever-changing\r\ncolors of space.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBehind him in the darkness, after a long time, someone said softly,\r\n\"Imagine being a Lhari and not being able to see anything out there but\r\nbright or brighter light.\"\r\n\r\nA bell rang melodiously in the ship and the passengers in the lounge\r\nbegan to stir and move toward the door, to stretch limbs cramped like\r\nBart's by tranced watching, to talk quickly of ordinary things.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose that bell means dinner,\" said a vaguely familiar voice at\r\nBart's elbow. \"Synthetics, I suppose, but at least we can all get\r\nacquainted.\"\r\n\r\nThe light from the undarkened hall fell on their faces as they moved\r\ntoward the door. \"Bart! Why, it can't be!\"\r\n\r\nIn utter dismay, Bart looked down into the face of Tommy Kendron.\r\n\r\nIn the rush of danger, he had absolutely forgotten that Tommy Kendron\r\nwas on this ship--to make his alias useless; Tommy was looking at him in\r\nsurprise and delight.\r\n\r\n\"Why didn't you tell me, or did you and your father decide at the last\r\nminute? Hey, it's great that we can go part way together, at least!\"\r\n\r\nBart knew he must cut this short very quickly. He stepped out into the\r\nfull corridor light so that Tommy could see his black hair.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry, you're confusing me with someone else.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bart, come off it--\" Tommy's voice died out. \"Sorry, I'd have sworn you\r\nwere a friend of mine.\"\r\n\r\nBart wondered suddenly, had he done the wrong thing? He had a feeling he\r\nmight need a friend. Badly.\r\n\r\nWell, it was too late now. He stared Tommy in the eye and said, \"I've\r\nnever seen you before in my life.\"\r\n\r\nTommy looked deflated. He stepped back slightly, shaking his head.\r\n\"Never saw such a resemblance. Are you a Vegan?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" Bart lied flatly. \"Aldebaran. David Briscoe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Glad to know you, Dave.\" With undiscourageable friendliness, Tommy\r\nstuck out a hand. \"Say, that bell means dinner, why don't we go down\r\ntogether? I don't know a soul on the ship, and it looks like\r\nluck--running into a fellow who could be my best friend's twin brother.\"\r\n\r\nBart felt warmed and drawn, but sensibly he knew he could not keep up\r\nthe pretense. Sooner or later, he'd give himself away, use some habitual\r\nphrase or gesture Tommy would recognize.\r\n\r\nShould he take a chance--reveal himself to Tommy and ask him to keep\r\nquiet? No. This wasn't a game. One man was already dead. He didn't want\r\nTommy to be next.\r\n\r\nThere was only one way out. He said coldly, \"thank you, but I have other\r\nthings to attend to. I intend to be very busy all through the voyage.\"\r\nHe spun on his heel and walked away before he could see Tommy's eager,\r\nfriendly smile turn hurt and defensive.\r\n\r\nBack in his cabin, he gloomily dialed some synthetic jellies, thinking\r\nwith annoyance of the anticipated good food of the dining room. He knew\r\nhe couldn't risk meeting Tommy again, and drearily resigned himself to\r\nstaying in his cabin. It looked like an awfully boring trip ahead.\r\n\r\nIt was. It was a week before the Lhari ship went into warp-drive, and\r\nall that time Bart stayed in his cabin, not daring to go to the\r\nobservation Lounge or dining hall. He got tired of eating synthetics\r\n(oh, they were nourishing enough, but they were altogether\r\nuninteresting) and tired of listening to the tapes the room steward got\r\nhim from the ship's library. By the time they had been in space a week,\r\nhe was so bored with his own company that even the Mentorian medic was a\r\nwelcome sight when he came in to prepare him for cold-sleep.\r\n\r\nBart had had the best education on Earth, but he didn't know precisely\r\nhow the Lhari warp-drive worked. He'd been told that only a few of the\r\nLhari understood it, just as the man who flew a copter didn't need to\r\nunderstand Newton's Three Laws of Motion in order to get himself back\r\nand forth to work.\r\n\r\nBut he knew this much; when the ship generated the frequencies which\r\naccelerated it beyond the speed of light, in effect the ship went into a\r\nsort of fourth dimension, and came out of it a good many light-years\r\naway. As far as Bart knew, no human being had ever survived warp-drive\r\nexcept in the suspended animation which they called cold-sleep. While\r\nthe medic was professionally reassuring him and strapping him in his\r\nbunk, Bart wondered what humans would do with the Lhari star-drive if\r\nthey had it. Well, he supposed they could use automation in their ships.\r\n\r\nThe Mentorian paused, needle in hand. \"Do you wish to be wakened for the\r\nweek we shall spend in each of the Proxima, Sirius and Pollux systems,\r\nsir? You can, of course, be given enough drug to keep you in cold-sleep\r\nuntil we reach the Procyon system.\"\r\n\r\nBart wondered if the room steward had mentioned the passenger so bored\r\nwith the trip that he didn't even visit the Observation Lounge. He felt\r\ntempted--he was getting awfully tired of staring at the walls. On the\r\nother hand, he wanted very much to see the other star-systems. When he\r\npassed through them on the trip to Earth, he'd been too young to pay\r\nmuch attention.\r\n\r\nFirmly he put the temptation aside. Better not to risk meeting other\r\npassengers, Tommy especially, if he decided he couldn't take the\r\nboredom.\r\n\r\nThe needle went into his arm. He felt himself sinking into sleep, and,\r\nin sudden panic, realized that he was helpless. The ship would touch\r\ndown on three worlds, and on any of them the Lhari might have his\r\ndescription, or his alias! He could be taken off, drugged and\r\nunconscious, and might never wake up! He tried to move, to protest, to\r\ntell them he was changing his mind, but already he was unable to speak.\r\nThere was a freezing moment of intense, painful cold. Then he was\r\nfloating in what felt like waves of cosmic dust, swirling many-colored\r\nbefore his eyes. And then there was nothing, no color, nothing at all\r\nexcept the nowhere night of sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOUR\r\n\r\n\r\nBart felt cold. He stirred, moved his head in drowsy protest; then\r\nmemory came flooding back, and in sudden panic he sat up, flinging out\r\nhis arms as if to ward away anyone who would lay hands on him.\r\n\r\n\"Easy!\" said a soothing voice. A Mentorian--not the same Mentorian--bent\r\nover him. \"We have just entered the gravitational field of Procyon\r\nplanet Alpha, Mr. Briscoe. Touchdown in four hours.\"\r\n\r\nBart mumbled an apology.\r\n\r\n\"Think nothing of it. Quite a number of people who aren't used to the\r\ncold-sleep drug suffer from minor lapses of memory. How do you feel\r\nnow?\"\r\n\r\nBart's legs were numb and his hands tingled when he sat up; but his body\r\nprocesses had been slowed so much by the cold-sleep that he didn't even\r\nfeel hungry; the synthetic jelly he'd eaten just before going to sleep\r\nwasn't even digested yet.\r\n\r\nWhen the Mentorian left for another cabin, Bart looked around, and\r\nsuddenly felt he would stifle if he stayed here another minute. He\r\nwasn't likely to run into Tommy twice in a row, and if he did, well,\r\nTommy would probably remember the snub he'd had and stay away from Dave\r\nBriscoe. And he wanted another sight of the stars--before he went into\r\nworry and danger.\r\n\r\nHe went down to the Observation Lounge.\r\n\r\nThe cosmic dust was brighter out here, and the constellations looked a\r\nlittle flattened. Textbook tables came back to him. He had traveled 47\r\nlight-years--he couldn't remember how many _billions_ of miles that was.\r\nEven so, it was only the tiniest hop-skip-and-jump in the measureless\r\nvastness of space.\r\n\r\nThe ship was streaking toward Procyon, a sol-type star, bright yellow;\r\nthe three planets, Alpha, Beta and Gamma, ringed like Saturn and veiled\r\nin shimmering layers of cloud, swung against the night. Past them other\r\nstars, brighter stars, faraway stars he would never see, glimmered\r\nthrough the pale dust....\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Dave. Been space-sick all this time? Remember me? I met you\r\nabout six weeks ago in the lounge down here--just out from Earth.\"\r\n\r\n_Oh, no!_ Bart turned, with a mental groan, to face Tommy. \"I've been in\r\ncold-sleep,\" he said. He _couldn't_ be rude again.\r\n\r\n\"What a dull way to face a long trip!\" Tommy said cheerily. \"I've\r\nenjoyed every minute of it myself.\"\r\n\r\nIt was hard for Bart to realize that, for Tommy, their meeting had been\r\nsix weeks ago. It all seemed dreamlike. The closer he came to it, the\r\nless he could realize that in a few hours he'd be getting off on a\r\nstrange world, with only the strange name _Raynor Three_ as a guide. He\r\nfelt terribly alone, and having Tommy close at hand helped, even though\r\nTommy didn't know he was helping.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe I should have stayed awake.\"\r\n\r\n\"You should,\" Tommy said. \"I only slept for a couple of hours at each\r\nwarp-drive shift. We had a day-long stopover at Sirius Eighteen, and I\r\ntook a tour of the planet. And I've spent a lot of time down here, just\r\nstar-gazing--not that it did me much good. Which one is Antares? How do\r\nyou tell it from Aldebaran? I'm always getting them mixed up.\"\r\n\r\nBart pointed. \"Aldebaran--that's the big red one there,\" he said. \"Think\r\nof the constellation Taurus as a necklace, with Aldebaran hanging from\r\nit like a locket. Antares is much further down in the sky, in relation\r\nto the arbitrary sidereal axis, and it's a deeper red. Like a burning\r\ncoal, while Aldebaran is like a ruby--\"\r\n\r\nHe broke off in mid-word, realizing that Tommy was gazing at him in a\r\nmixture of triumph and consternation. Too late, Bart realized he had\r\nbeen tricked. Studying for an exam, the year before, he had explained\r\nthe difference between the two red stars in almost the same words.\r\n\r\n\"Bart,\" Tommy said in a whisper, \"I knew it had to be you. Why didn't\r\nyou tell me, fella?\"\r\n\r\nBart felt himself start to smile, but it only stretched his mouth. He\r\nsaid, very low, \"Don't say my name out loud Tom. I'm in terrible\r\ntrouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why didn't you tell me? What's a friend for?\"\r\n\r\n\"We can't talk here. And all the cabins are wired for sound in case\r\nsomebody stops breathing, or has a heart attack in space,\" Bart said,\r\nglancing around.\r\n\r\nThey went and stood at the very foot of the quartz window, seeming to\r\ntread the brink of a dizzying gulf of cosmic space, and talked in low\r\ntones while Alpha and Beta and Gamma swelled like blown-up balloons in\r\nthe port.\r\n\r\nTommy listened, almost incredulous. \"And you're hoping to find your\r\nfather, with no more information than that? It's a big universe,\" he\r\nsaid, waving at the gulf of stars. \"The Lhari ships, according to the\r\nlittle tourist pamphlet they gave me, touch down at nine hundred and\r\ntwenty-two different stars in this galaxy!\"\r\n\r\nBart visibly winced, and Tommy urged, \"Come to Capella with me. You can\r\nstay with my family as long as you want to, and appeal to the\r\nInterplanet authority to find your father. They'd protect him against\r\nthe Lhari, surely. You can't chase all over the galaxy playing\r\ninterplanetary spy all by yourself, Bart!\"\r\n\r\nBut Briscoe had deliberately gone to his death, to give Bart the chance\r\nto get away. He wouldn't have died to send Bart into a trap he could\r\neasily have sprung on Earth.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, Tommy. But I've got to play it my way.\"\r\n\r\nTommy said firmly, \"Count me in then. My ticket has stopover privileges.\r\nI'll get off at Procyon with you.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a temptation--to have a friend at his back. He put his hand on\r\nTommy's shoulder, grateful beyond words. But fresh horror seized him as\r\nhe remembered the horrible puddle of melted robotcab with Briscoe\r\nsomewhere in the residue. _Protoplasm residue enough for two bodies._ He\r\ncouldn't let Tommy face that.\r\n\r\n\"Tommy, I appreciate that, believe me. But if I did find my father and\r\nhis friends, I don't want anyone tracing me. You'd only make the danger\r\nworse. The best thing you can do is stay out of it.\"\r\n\r\nTommy faced him squarely. \"One thing's for sure. I'm not going to let\r\nyou go off and never know whether you're alive or dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll try to get a message to you,\" Bart said, \"if I can. But whatever\r\nhappens, Tommy, stay with the ship and go on to Capella. It's the one\r\nthing you can do to help me.\"\r\n\r\nA warning bell rang in the ship. He broke sharply away from Tommy,\r\nsaying over his shoulder, \"It's all you can do to help, Tom. Do\r\nit--please? Just stay clear?\"\r\n\r\nTommy reached out and caught his arm. \"Okay,\" he said reluctantly, \"I\r\nwill. But you be careful,\" he added fiercely. \"You hear me? And if I\r\ndon't hear from you in some reasonable time, I'll raise a stink from\r\nhere to Vega!\"\r\n\r\nBart broke away and ran. He was afraid, if he didn't, he'd break up\r\nagain. He closed the cabin door behind him, trying to calm down so that\r\nthe Mentorian steward, coming to strap him in for deceleration, wouldn't\r\nsee how upset he was. He was going to need all his nerve.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe went through another decontamination chamber, and finally moved, with\r\na line of passengers, out of the yawning airlock, under the strange sun,\r\ninto the strange world.\r\n\r\nAt first sight it was a disappointment. It was a Lhari spaceport that\r\nlay before him, to all appearances identical with the one on Earth:\r\nsloping glass ramps, tall colorless pylons, a skyscraper terminus\r\ncrowded with men of all planets. But the sun overhead was brilliant and\r\nclear gold, the shadows sharp and violet on the spaceport floor. Behind\r\nthe confines of the spaceport he could see the ridges of tall hills and\r\nunfamiliarly colored trees. He longed to explore them, but he got a grip\r\non his imagination, surrendering his ticket stub and false papers to the\r\nLhari and Mentorian interpreter who guarded the ramp.\r\n\r\nThe Lhari said to the Mentorian, in the Lhari language, \"Keep him for\r\nquestioning but don't tell him why.\" Bart felt a cold chill icing his\r\nspine. _This was it._\r\n\r\nThe Mentorian said briefly, \"We wish to check on the proper antibody\r\ncomponent for Aldebaran natives. There will be a delay of about thirty\r\nminutes. Will you kindly wait in this room here?\"\r\n\r\nThe room was comfortable, furnished with chairs and a vision-screen with\r\nsome colorful story moving on it, small bright figures in capes, curious\r\nbeasts racing across an unusual veldt; but Bart paced the floor\r\nrestlessly. There were two doors in the room. Through one of them, he\r\nhad been admitted; he could see, through the glass door, the silhouette\r\nof the Mentorian outside. The other door was opaque, and marked in large\r\nletters:\r\n\r\n     DANGER HUMANS MUST NOT PASS WITHOUT SPECIAL LENSES TYPE X.\r\n     ORDINARY SPACE LENSES WILL NOT SUFFICE DANGER! LHARI OPENING!\r\n     ADJUST X LENSES BEFORE OPENING!\r\n\r\nBart read the sign again. Well, _that_ was no way out, for sure! He had\r\nheard that the Lhari sun was almost 500 times as bright as Earth's. The\r\nMentorians alone, among humans, could endure Lhari lights--he supposed\r\nthe warning was for ordinary spaceport workers.\r\n\r\nA sudden, rather desperate plan occurred to Bart. He didn't know how\r\nmuch light he _could_ tolerate--he'd never been on Mentor--but he _had_\r\ninherited some of his mother's tolerance for light. And blindness would\r\nbe better than being burned down with an energon-gun! He went hesitantly\r\ntoward the door, and pushed it open.\r\n\r\nHis eyes exploded into pain; automatically his hands went up to shield\r\nthem. Light, light--he had never known such cruelly glowing light. Even\r\nthrough the lids there was pain and red afterimages; but after a moment,\r\nopening them a slit, he found that he could see, and made out other\r\ndoors, glass ramps, pale Lhari figures coming and going. But for the\r\nmoment he was alone in the long corridor beyond which he could see the\r\nglass ramps.\r\n\r\nNearby, a door opened into a small office with glass walls; on a peg,\r\none of the silky metallic cloaks worn by Mentorians doing spaceport work\r\nwas hanging. On an impulse, Bart caught it up and flung it around his\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\nIt felt cool and soft, and the hood shielded his eyes a little. The ramp\r\nleading down to what he hoped was street level was terribly steep and\r\nthere were no steps. Bart eased himself over the top of the ramp and let\r\ngo. He whooshed down the slick surface on the flat of his back, feeling\r\nthe metal of the cloak heat with the friction, and came to a breathless\r\njarring stop at the bottom. Whew, what a slide! Three stories, at least!\r\nBut there was a door, and outside the door, maybe, safety.\r\n\r\nA voice hailed him, in Lhari. \"You, there!\"\r\n\r\nBart could see well now. He made out the form of a Lhari, only a\r\ncolorless blob in the intense light.\r\n\r\n\"You people know better than to come back here without glasses. Do you\r\nwant to be blinded, my friend?\" He actually sounded kind and concerned.\r\nBart tensed, his heart pounding. Now that he was caught, could he bluff\r\nhis way out? He hadn't actually spoken the Lhari language in years,\r\nthough his mother had taught it to him when he was young enough to learn\r\nit without a trace of accent.\r\n\r\nWell, he must try. \"Margil sent me to check,\" he improvised quickly.\r\n\"They were holding someone for questioning, and he seems to have gotten\r\naway somehow, so I wanted to make sure he didn't come through here.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter that one man can give us all the slip this way?\" the\r\nLhari said curiously. \"Well, one thing is sure, he's Vegan or Solarian\r\nor Capellan, one of the dim-star people. If he comes through here, we'll\r\ncatch him easily enough while he's stumbling around half blind. You know\r\nthat you shouldn't stay long.\" He gestured. \"Out this way--and don't\r\ncome back without special lenses.\"\r\n\r\nBart nodded, jerking the cloak around his shoulders, forcing himself not\r\nto break into a run as he stepped through the door the Lhari indicated.\r\nIt closed behind him. Bart blinked, feeling as if he had stepped into\r\npitch darkness. Only slowly did his eyes adapt and he became aware that\r\nhe was standing in a city street, in the full glow of Procyon sunlight,\r\nand apparently outside the Lhari spaceport entirely.\r\n\r\nHe'd better get to cover! He took off the Mentorian cloak, thrust it\r\nunder his arm. He raised his eyes, which were adjusting to ordinary\r\nlight again, and stopped dead.\r\n\r\nJust across the street was a long, low, rainbow colored building. And\r\nthe letters--Bart blinked, thinking his eyes deceived him--spelled out:\r\n\r\n    EIGHT COLORS TRANSSHIPPING CORPORATION\r\n    CARGO, PASSENGERS, MESSAGES, EXPRESS\r\n    A. RAYNOR ONE, MANAGER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIVE\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a moment the words swirled before Bart's still-watering eyes. He\r\nwiped them, trying to steady himself. Had he so soon reached the end of\r\nhis dangerous quest? Somehow he had expected it to lie in deep, dark\r\nconcealment.\r\n\r\nRaynor One. The existence of Raynor _One_ presupposed a Raynor _Two_ and\r\nprobably a Raynor _Three_--for all he knew, Raynors Four, Five, Six, and\r\nSixty-six! The building looked solid and real. It had evidently been\r\nthere a long time.\r\n\r\nWith his hand on the door, he hesitated. Was it, after all, the _right_\r\nEight Colors? But it was a family saying; hardly the sort of thing you'd\r\nbe apt to hear outside. He pushed the door and went in.\r\n\r\nThe room was filled with brighter light than the Procyon sun outdoors,\r\nthe edges of the furniture rimmed with neon in the Mentorian fashion. A\r\nprim-looking girl sat behind a desk--or what should have been a desk,\r\nexcept that it looked more like a mirror, with little sparkles of\r\nlights, different colors, in regular rows along one edge. The mirror-top\r\nitself was blue-violet and gave her skin and her violet eyes a bluish\r\ntinge. She was smooth and lacquered and glittering and she raised her\r\neyebrows at Bart as if he were some strange form of life she hadn't seen\r\nvery often.\r\n\r\n\"I'd--er--like to see Raynor One,\" he said.\r\n\r\nHer dainty pointed fingernail, varnished blue, stabbed at points of\r\nlight. \"On what business?\" she asked, not caring.\r\n\r\n\"It's a personal matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I suggest you see him at his home.\"\r\n\r\n\"It can't wait that long.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl studied the glassy surface and punched at some more of the\r\nlittle lights. \"Name, please?\"\r\n\r\n\"David Briscoe.\"\r\n\r\nHe had thought her perfect-painted face could not show any emotion\r\nexcept disdain, but it did. She looked at him in open, blank\r\nconsternation. She said into the vision-screen, \"He calls himself David\r\nBriscoe. Yes, I know. Yes, sir, yes.\" She raised her face, and it was\r\ncontrolled again, but not bored. \"Raynor One will see you. Through that\r\ndoor, and down to the end of the hall.\"\r\n\r\nAt the end of the hallway was another door. He stepped through into a\r\nsmall cubicle, and the door slid shut like a closing trap. He whirled in\r\npanic, then subsided in foolish relief as the cubicle began to rise--it\r\nwas just an automatic elevator.\r\n\r\nIt rose higher and higher, stopping with an abrupt jerk, and slid open\r\ninto a lighted room and office. A man sat behind a desk, watching Bart\r\nstep from the elevator. The man was very tall and very thin, and the\r\ngray eyes, and the intensity of the lights, told Bart that he was a\r\nMentorian. _Raynor One?_\r\n\r\nUnder the steady, stern gray stare, Bart felt the slow, clutching suck\r\nof fear again. Was this man a slave of the Lhari, who would turn him\r\nover to them? Or someone he could trust? His own mother had been a\r\nMentorian.\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\" Raynor One's voice was harsh, and gave the impression of\r\nbeing loud, though it was not.\r\n\r\n\"David Briscoe.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the wrong thing. The Mentorian's mouth was taut, forbidding. \"Try\r\nagain. I happen to know that David Briscoe is dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have a message for Raynor Three.\"\r\n\r\nThe cold gray stare never altered. \"On what business?\"\r\n\r\nOn a sudden inspiration, Bart said, \"I'll tell you that if you can tell\r\nme what the Eighth Color is.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a glint in the grim eyes now, though the even, stern voice did\r\nnot soften. \"I never knew myself. I didn't name it Eight Colors. Maybe\r\nit's the original owner you want.\"\r\n\r\nOn a sudden hope, Bart asked, \"Was he, by any chance, named Rupert\r\nSteele?\"\r\n\r\nRaynor One made a suspicious movement. \"I can't imagine why you think\r\nso,\" he said guardedly. \"Especially if you've just come in from Earth.\r\nIt was never very widely known. He only changed the name to Eight Colors\r\na few weeks ago. And it's for sure that your ship didn't get any\r\nmessages while the Lhari were in warp-drive. You mention entirely too\r\nmany names, but I notice you aren't giving out any further information.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm looking for a man called Rupert Steele.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought you were looking for Raynor Three,\" said Raynor One, staring\r\nat the Mentorian cloak. \"I can think of a lot of people who might want\r\nto know how I react to certain names, and find out if I know the wrong\r\npeople, if they are the wrong people. What makes you think I'd admit it\r\nif I did?\"\r\n\r\nNow, Bart thought, they had reached a deadlock. Somebody had to trust\r\nsomebody. This could go on all night--parry and riposte, question and\r\nevasive answer, each of them throwing back the other's questions in a\r\nverbal fencing-match. Raynor One wasn't giving away any information.\r\nAnd, considering what was probably at stake, Bart didn't blame him much.\r\n\r\nHe flung the Mentorian cloak down on the table.\r\n\r\n\"This got me out of trouble--the hard way,\" he said. \"I never wore one\r\nbefore and I never intend to again. I want to find Rupert Steele because\r\nhe's my father!\"\r\n\r\n\"Your father. And just how are you going to prove that exceptionally\r\ninteresting statement?\"\r\n\r\nWithout warning, Bart lost his temper.\r\n\r\n\"I don't care whether I prove it or not! _You_ try proving something for\r\na change, why don't you? If you know Rupert Steele, I don't have to\r\nprove who I am--just take a good look at me! Or so Briscoe told me--a\r\nman who called himself Briscoe, anyway. He gave me papers to travel\r\nunder that name! I didn't ask for them, he shoved them into my hand.\r\n_That_ Briscoe is dead.\" Bart struck his fist hard on the desk, bending\r\nover Raynor One angrily.\r\n\r\n\"He sent me to find a man named Raynor Three. But the only one I really\r\ncare about finding is my father. Now you know as much as I do, how about\r\ngiving _me_ some information for a change?\"\r\n\r\nHe ran out of breath and stood glaring down at Raynor One, fists\r\nclenched. Raynor One got up and said, quick, savage and quiet, \"Did\r\nanyone see you come here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only the girl downstairs.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did you get through the Lhari? In that?\" He moved his head at the\r\nMentorian cloak.\r\n\r\nBart explained briefly, and Raynor One shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"You were lucky,\" he said, \"you could have been blinded. You must have\r\ninherited flash-accommodation from the Mentorian side--Rupert Steele\r\ndidn't have it. I'll tell you this much,\" he added, sitting down again.\r\n\"In a manner of speaking, you're my boss. Eight Colors--it used to be\r\nAlpha Transshipping--is what they call a middleman outfit. The\r\ninterplanet cargo lines transport from planet to planet within a\r\nsystem--that's free competition--and the Lhari ships transport from star\r\nto star--that's a monopoly all over the galaxy. The middleman outfits\r\narrange for orderly and businesslike liaison between the two. Rupert\r\nSteele bought into this company, a long time ago, but he left it for me\r\nto manage, until recently.\"\r\n\r\nRaynor punched a button, said to the image of the glossy girl at the\r\ndesk, \"Violet, get Three for me. You may have to send a message to the\r\n_Multiphase_.\"\r\n\r\nHe swung round to Bart again. \"You want a lot of explanations? Well,\r\nyou'll have to get 'em from somebody else. I don't know what this is all\r\nabout. I don't _want_ to know: I have to do business with the Lhari. The\r\nless I know, the less I'm apt to say to the wrong people. But I promised\r\nThree that if you turned up, or if anyone came and asked for the Eighth\r\nColor, I'd send you to him. That's all.\"\r\n\r\nHe motioned Bart ungraciously to a seat, and shut his mouth firmly, as\r\nif he had already said too much. Bart sat. After a while he heard the\r\nelevator again; the panel slid open and Raynor Three came into the room.\r\n\r\nIt had to be Raynor Three; there was no one else he could have been. He\r\nwas as like Raynor One as Tweedledum to Tweedledee: tall, stern, ascetic\r\nand grim. He wore the full uniform of a Mentorian on Lhari ships: the\r\nwhite smock of a medic, the metallic blue cloak, the low silvery\r\nsandals.\r\n\r\nHe said, \"What's doing, One? Violet--\" and then he caught sight of Bart.\r\nHis eyes narrowed and he drew a quick breath, his face twisting up into\r\napprehension and shock.\r\n\r\n\"It must be Steele's boy,\" he said, and immediately Bart saw the\r\ndifference between the--were they brothers? For Raynor One's face,\r\ncontrolled and stern, had not altered all during their interview, but\r\nRaynor Three's smile was wry and kindly at once, and his voice was low\r\nand gentle. \"He's the image of Rupert. Did he come in on his own name?\r\nHow'd he manage it?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. He had David Briscoe's papers.\"\r\n\r\n\"So the old man got through,\" said Raynor Three, with a low whistle.\r\n\"But that's not safe. Quick, give them to me, Bart.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Lhari have them.\"\r\n\r\nRaynor One walked to the window and said in his deadpan voice, \"It's\r\nuseless. But get the kid out of here before they come looking for me.\r\nLook.\"\r\n\r\nHe pointed. Below them, the streets were alive with uniformed Lhari and\r\nMentorians. Bart felt sick.\r\n\r\n\"If they had the same efficiency with red tape that we humans have, he'd\r\nnever have made it this far.\"\r\n\r\nRaynor Three actually smiled. \"But you can count on them for that much\r\ninefficiency,\" he said, and his eyes twinkled for a moment at Bart.\r\n\"That's how it was so easy to work the old double-shuffle trick on them.\r\nThey had Steele's description but not his name, so Briscoe took Steele's\r\npapers and managed to slip through. Once they landed on Earth, they had\r\nthe Steele _names_, but by the time that cleared, you were outbound with\r\nanother set of papers. It may have confused them, because they knew\r\n_David_ Briscoe was dead--and there was just a chance you were an\r\ninnocent bystander who could raise a real row if they pulled you in. Did\r\nold Briscoe get away?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" Bart said, harshly, \"he's dead.\"\r\n\r\nRaynor Three's mobile face held shocked sadness. \"Two brave men,\" he\r\nsaid softly, \"Edmund Briscoe the father, David Briscoe the son. Remember\r\nthe name, Bart, because I won't remember it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\nRaynor Three gave him a gold-glinting, enigmatic glance. \"I'm a\r\nMentorian, remember? I'm good at not remembering things. Just be glad I\r\nremember Rupert Steele. If you'd been a few days later, I wouldn't have\r\nremembered him, though I promised to wait for you.\"\r\n\r\nRaynor One demanded, \"Get him _out_ of here, Three!\"\r\n\r\nRaynor Three swung to Bart. \"Put that on again.\" He indicated the\r\nMentorian cloak. \"Pull the hood right up over your head. Now, if we meet\r\nanyone, say a polite good afternoon in Lhari--you _can_ speak\r\nLhari?--and leave the rest of the talking to me.\"\r\n\r\nBart felt like cringing as they came out into the street full of Lhari;\r\nbut Raynor Three whispered, \"Attack is the best defense,\" and went up to\r\none of the Lhari. \"What's going on, _rieko mori_?\"\r\n\r\n\"A passenger on the ship got away without going through Decontam. He may\r\nspread disease, so of course we have alerted all authorities,\" the Lhari\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nAs the Lhari strode past, Raynor Three grimaced. \"Clever, that. Now the\r\nwhole planet will be hunting for any stranger, worrying themselves into\r\nfits about some unauthorized germ. We'd better get you to a safe place.\r\nMy country house is a good way off, but I have a copter.\"\r\n\r\nBart demanded, as they climbed in, \"Are you taking me to my father?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait till we get to my place,\" Raynor Three said, taking the controls\r\nand putting the machine in the air. \"Just lean back and enjoy the trip,\r\nhuh?\"\r\n\r\nBart relaxed against the cushions, but he still felt apprehensive. Where\r\nwas his father? If he was a fugitive from the Lhari, he might by now be\r\nat the other end of the galaxy. But if his father couldn't travel on\r\nLhari ships, and if he had been here, the chances were that he was still\r\nsomewhere in the Procyon system.\r\n\r\nThey flew for a long time; across low hills, patchwork agricultural\r\ndistricts, towns, and then for a long time over water. The copter had\r\nautomatic controls, but Raynor Three kept it on manual, and Bart\r\nwondered if the Mentorian just didn't want to talk.\r\n\r\nIt began to descend, at last, toward a small green hill, bright in the\r\nlast gold rays on sunset. A small domelike pink bubble rose out of the\r\nhill. Raynor Three set the copter neatly down on a platform that slid\r\nshut after them, unfastened their seat belts and gave Bart a hand to\r\nclimb out.\r\n\r\nHe ushered him into a living room of glass and chrome, softly lighted,\r\nbut deserted and faintly dusty. Raynor pushed a switch; soft music came\r\non, and the carpets caressed his feet. He motioned Bart to a chair.\r\n\r\n\"You're safe here, for a while,\" Raynor Three said, \"though how long,\r\nnobody knows. But so far, I've been above suspicion.\"'\r\n\r\nBart leaned back; the chair was very comfortable, but the comfort could\r\nnot help him to relax.\r\n\r\n\"Where is my father?\" he demanded.\r\n\r\nRaynor Three stood looking down at him, his mobile face drawn and\r\nstrange. \"I guess I can't put it off any longer,\" he said softly. Then\r\nhe covered his face with his hands. From behind them hoarse words came,\r\nchoked with emotion.\r\n\r\n\"Your father is dead, Bart. I--I killed him.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIX\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a moment Bart stared, frozen, unable to move, his very ears refusing\r\nthe words he heard. Had this all been another cruel trick, then, a trap,\r\na betrayal? He rose and looked wildly around the room, as if the glass\r\nwalls were a cage closing in on him.\r\n\r\n\"Murderer!\" he flung at Raynor, and took a step toward him, his clenched\r\nfists coming up. He'd been shoved around too long, but here he had one\r\nof them right in front of him, and for once he'd hit back! He'd start by\r\ntaking Raynor Three apart--in small pieces! \"You--you rotten murderer!\"\r\n\r\nRaynor Three made no move to defend himself. \"Bart,\" he said\r\ncompassionately, \"sit down and listen to me. No, I'm no murderer. I--I\r\nshouldn't have put it that way.\"\r\n\r\nBart's hands dropped to his sides, but he heard his voice crack with\r\npain and grief: \"I suppose you'll tell me he was a spy or a traitor and\r\nyou _had_ to kill him!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not even that. I tried to save your father, I did everything I could.\r\nI'm no murderer, Bart. I killed him, yes--God forgive me, because I'll\r\nnever forgive myself!\"\r\n\r\nBart's fists unclenched and he stared down at Raynor Three, shaking his\r\nhead in bewilderment and pain. \"I knew he was dead! I knew it all along!\r\nI was trying not to believe it, but I knew!\"\r\n\r\n\"I liked your father. I admired him. He took a long chance, and it\r\nkilled him. I could have stopped him, I should have stopped him, but how\r\ncould I? Where did I have the right to stop him, after what I did\r\nto--\" he stopped, almost in mid-word, as if a switch had been turned.\r\n\r\nBut Bart was not listening. He swung away, striding to the wall as if he\r\nwould kick it in, striking it with his two clenched fists, his whole\r\nbeing in revolt. _Dad, oh, Dad! I kept going, I thought at the end of it\r\nyou'd be here and it would all be over. But here I am at the end of it\r\nall, and you're not here, you won't ever be here again._\r\n\r\nDimly, he knew when Raynor Three rose and left him alone. He leaned his\r\nhead on his clenched fists, and cried.\r\n\r\nAfter a long time he raised his head and blew his nose, his face setting\r\nitself in new, hard, unaccustomed lines, slowly coming to terms with the\r\nhard, painful reality. His father was dead. His dangerous,\r\ndead-in-earnest game of escape had no happy ending of reunion with his\r\nfather. They couldn't sit together and laugh about how scared he had\r\nbeen. His father was _dead_, and he, Bart, was alone and in danger. His\r\nface looked very grim indeed, and years older than he was.\r\n\r\nAfter a long time Raynor Three opened the door quietly. \"Come and have\r\nsomething to eat, Bart.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not hungry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I am,\" Raynor Three said, \"and you ought to be. You'll need it.\"\r\nHe pulled knobs and the appropriate tables and chairs extruded\r\nthemselves from the walls. Raynor unsealed hot cartons and spread them\r\non the table, saying lightly, \"Looks good--not that I can claim any\r\ncredit, I subscribe to a food service that delivers them hot by\r\npneumatic tube.\"\r\n\r\nBart felt sickened by the thought of eating, but when he put a polite\r\nfork in the food, he discovered that he was famished and ate up\r\neverything in sight. When they had finished, Raynor dumped the cartons\r\ninto a disposal chute, went to a small portable bar and put a glass into\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\n\"Drink this.\"\r\n\r\nBart touched his lips to the glass, made a face and put it away.\r\n\"Thanks, but I don't drink.\"\r\n\r\n\"Call it medicine, you'll need something,\" Raynor Three said crossly.\r\n\"I've got a lot to tell you, and I don't want you going off half-primed\r\nin the middle of a sentence. If you'd rather have a shot of\r\ntranquilizer, all right; otherwise, I prescribe that you drink what I\r\ngave you.\" He gave Bart a quick, wry grin. \"I really am a medic, you\r\nknow.\"\r\n\r\nFeeling like a scolded child, Bart drank. It burned his mouth, but after\r\nit was down, he felt a sort of warm burning in his insides that\r\ngradually spread a sense of well-being all through him. It wasn't\r\nalcohol, but whatever it was, it had quite a kick.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks,\" he muttered. \"Why are you taking this trouble, Raynor? There\r\nmust be danger--\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you know--\" Raynor broke off. \"Obviously, you don't. Your mother\r\nnever said much about your Mentorian family tree, I suppose? She was a\r\nRaynor.\" He smiled at Bart, a little ruefully. \"I won't claim a\r\nkinsman's privileges until you decide how much to trust me.\"\r\n\r\nRaynor Three settled back.\r\n\r\n\"It's a long story and I only know part of it,\" he began. \"Our family,\r\nthe Raynors, have traded with the Lhari for more generations than I can\r\ncount. When I was a young man, I qualified as a medic on the Lhari\r\nships, and I've been star-hopping ever since. People call us the slaves\r\nof the Lhari--maybe we are,\" he added wryly. \"But I began it just\r\nbecause space is where I belong, and there's nowhere else that I've ever\r\nwanted to be. And I'll take it at any price.\r\n\r\n\"I never questioned what I was doing until a few years ago. It was your\r\nfather who made me wonder if we Mentorians were blind and selfish--this\r\nprivilege ought to belong to everyone, not just the Lhari. More and\r\nmore, the Lhari monopoly seemed wrong to me. But I was just a medic. And\r\nif I involved myself in any conspiracy against the Lhari, they'd find it\r\nout in the routine psych-checking.\r\n\r\n\"And then we worked out how it could be done. Before every trip, with\r\nself-hypnosis and self-suggestion, I erase my own memories--a sort of\r\nartificial amnesia--so that the Lhari can't find out any more than I\r\nwant them to find out. Of course, it also means that I have no memory,\r\nwhile I'm on the Lhari ships, of what I've agreed to while I'm--\" His\r\nface suddenly worked, and his mouth moved without words, as if he had\r\nrun into some powerful barrier against speech.\r\n\r\nIt was a full minute, while Bart stared in dismay, before he found his\r\nvoice again, saying, \"So far, it was just a sort of loose network,\r\ntrying to put together stray bits of information that the Lhari didn't\r\nthink important enough to censor.\r\n\r\n\"And then came the big breakthrough. There was a young Apprentice\r\nastrogator named David Briscoe. He'd taken some runs in special test\r\nships, and read some extremely obscure research data from the early days\r\nof the contact between men and Lhari, and he had a wild idea. He did the\r\nbravest thing anyone has ever done. He stripped himself of all\r\nidentifying data--so that if he died, no one would be in trouble with\r\nthe Lhari--and stowed away on a Lhari ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"But--\" Bart's lips were dry--\"didn't he die in the warp-drive?\"\r\n\r\nSlowly, Raynor Three shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"No, he didn't. No drugs, no cold-sleep--but he didn't die. Don't you\r\nsee, Bart?\" He leaned forward, urgently.\r\n\r\n\"_It's all a fake!_ The Lhari have just been saying that to justify\r\ntheir refusal to give us the secret of the catalyst that generates the\r\nwarp-drive frequencies! Such a simple lie, and it's worked for all these\r\nyears!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"A Mentorian found him and didn't have the heart to turn him over to the\r\nLhari. So he was smuggled clear again. But when that Mentorian underwent\r\nthe routine brain-checks at the end of the voyage, the Lhari found out\r\nwhat had happened. They didn't know Briscoe's name, but they wrung that\r\nMentorian out like a wet dishcloth and got a description that was as\r\ngood as fingerprints. They tracked down young Briscoe and killed him.\r\nThey killed the first man he'd talked to. They killed the second. The\r\nthird was your father.\"\r\n\r\n\"The murdering devils!\"\r\n\r\nRaynor sighed. \"Your father and Briscoe's father were old friends.\r\nBriscoe's father was dying with incurable heart disease; _his_ son was\r\ndead, and old Briscoe had only one thought in his mind--to make sure he\r\ndidn't die for nothing. So he took your father's papers, knowing they\r\nwere as good as a death warrant, slipped away and boarded a Lhari ship\r\nthat led roundabout to stars where the message hadn't reached yet. He\r\nled them a good chase. Did he die or did they track him down and kill\r\nhim?\" Bart bowed his head and told the story.\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile,\" Raynor Three continued, \"your father came to me, knowing I\r\nwas sympathetic, knowing I was a Lhari-trained surgeon. He had just one\r\nthought in his mind: to do, again, what David Briscoe had done, and make\r\nsure the news got out this time. He cooked up a plan that was even\r\nbraver and more desperate. He decided to sign on a Lhari ship as a\r\nmember of the crew.\"\r\n\r\n\"As a Mentorian?\" Bart asked, but something cold, like ice water\r\ntrickling down his back, told him this was not what Raynor meant. \"The\r\nbrainwashing--\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Raynor, \"not as a Mentorian; he couldn't have escaped the\r\npsych-checking. _As a Lhari._\"\r\n\r\nBart gasped. \"How--\"\r\n\r\n\"Men and Lhari are very much alike,\" Raynor Three said. \"A few small\r\nthings--skin color, the shape of the ears, the hands and claws--keep\r\nhumans from seeing that the Lhari are men.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't say that,\" Bart almost yelled. \"Those filthy, murdering devils!\r\nYou call those monsters men?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've lived among the Lhari all my life. They're not devils, Bart, they\r\nhave their reasons. Physiologically, the Lhari are--well, _humanoid_, if\r\nyou like that better. They're a lot more like a man than a man is like,\r\nfor instance, a gorilla. Your father convinced me that with minor\r\nplastic and facial surgery, he could pass as a Lhari. And finally I gave\r\nin, and did the surgery--\"\r\n\r\n\"And it killed him!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not really. It was a completely unforeseeable thing--a blood clot broke\r\nloose in a vein, and lodged in his brain. He was dead in seconds. It\r\ncould have happened at any time,\" he said, \"yet I feel responsible, even\r\nthough I keep telling myself I'm not. And I'll help you as much as I\r\ncan--for his sake, and for your mother's. The Lhari don't watch me too\r\nclosely--they figure that anything I do they'll catch in the\r\nbrainwashing. But I'm still one step ahead of them, as long as I can\r\nerase my own memories.\"\r\n\r\nBart was sifting it all, slowly, in his mind.\r\n\r\n\"Why was Dad doing this? What could he gain?\"\r\n\r\n\"You know we can build ships as good as the Lhari ships, but we don't\r\nknow anything about the rare catalyst they use for warp-drive fuel.\r\nCaptain Steele had hopes of being able to discover where they got it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But couldn't they find out where the Lhari ships go for fueling?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. There's no way to trail a Lhari ship,\" he reminded Bart. \"We can\r\nfollow them inside a star-system, but then they pop into warp-drive, and\r\nwe don't know where they go when they aren't running between _our_\r\nstars.\r\n\r\n\"We've gathered together what information we _do_ have, and we know that\r\nafter a certain number of runs in our part of the galaxy, ships take off\r\nin the direction of Antares. There's a ship, due to come in here in\r\nabout ten days, called the _Swiftwing_, which is just about due to make\r\nthe Antares run. Captain Steele had managed to arrange--I don't know\r\nhow, and I don't want to know how--for a vacancy on that ship, and\r\nsomehow he got credentials. You see, it's a very good spy system, a\r\nnetwork between the stars, but the weak link is this: everything, every\r\nmessage, every man, has to travel back and forth by the Lhari ships\r\nthemselves.\"\r\n\r\nHe rose, shaking it all off impatiently. \"Well, it's finished now. Your\r\nfather is dead. What are you going to do? If you want to go back to\r\nVega, you can probably convince the Lhari you're just an innocent\r\nbystander. They _don't_ hurt bystanders or children, Bart. They aren't\r\nbad people. They're just protecting their business monopoly.\r\n\r\n\"The safest way to handle it would be this: let me erase your memories\r\nof what I've told you tonight. Then just let the Lhari capture you. They\r\nwon't kill you. They'll just give you a light psych-check. When they\r\nfind out you don't know anything, they'll send you back to Vega, and you\r\ncan spend the rest of your life in peace, running Vega Interplanet and\r\nEight Colors.\"\r\n\r\nBart turned on him furiously. \"You mean, go home like a good little boy,\r\nand pretend none of this ever happened? What do you think I am, anyhow?\"\r\nBart's chin set in the new, hard line. \"What I want is a chance to go on\r\nwhere Dad left off!\"\r\n\r\n\"It won't be easy, and it could be dangerous,\" Raynor Three said, \"but\r\nthere's nothing else to be done. We had the arrangements all made; and\r\nnow somebody's got to take the dangerous risk of calling them off. Are\r\nyou game for a little plastic surgery--just enough to change your looks\r\nagain, with new forged papers? You can't go by the _Swiftwing_--it\r\ndoesn't carry passengers--but there's another route you can take.\"\r\n\r\nBart sprang up. \"No,\" he said, \"I know a better way. Let me go on the\r\n_Swiftwing_--in Dad's place--_as a Lhari_!\"\r\n\r\n\"Bart, no,\" Raynor Three said. \"You'd never get away with it. It's too\r\ndangerous.\" But his gold eyes glinted.\r\n\r\n\"Why not? I speak Lhari better than Dad ever did. And my eyes can stand\r\nLhari lights. You said yourself, it's going to be a dangerous job just\r\ncalling off all the arrangements. So let's _not_ call them off. Just let\r\nme take Dad's place!\"\r\n\r\n\"Bart, you're only a boy--\"\r\n\r\n\"What was Dave Briscoe? No, Raynor. Dad left me a lot more than Vega\r\nInterplanet, and you know it. I'll finish what he started, and then\r\nmaybe I'll begin to deserve what he left me.\"\r\n\r\nRaynor Three gripped Bart's hand. He said, in a voice that shook, \"All\r\nright, Bart. You're your father's son. I can't say more than that. I\r\nhaven't any right to stop you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVEN\r\n\r\n\r\n\"All right, Bart, today we'll let you look at yourself,\" Raynor Three\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nBart smiled under the muffling layers of bandage around his face. His\r\nhands were bandaged, too, and he had not been permitted to look in a\r\nmirror. But the transition had been surprisingly painless--or perhaps\r\nhis sense of well-being had been due to Raynor Three slipping him some\r\ndrug.\r\n\r\nHe'd been given injections of a chemical that would change the color of\r\nhis skin; there had been minor operations on his face, his hands, his\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n\"Let's see you get up and walk around.\"\r\n\r\nBart obeyed awkwardly, and Raynor frowned. \"Hurt?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not exactly, but I feel as if I were limping.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's to be expected. I changed the angle of the heel tendon and the\r\nmuscle of the arch. You're using a different set of muscles when you\r\nwalk; until they harden up, you'll have some assorted Charley horses.\r\nHave any trouble hearing me?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, though I'd hear better without all these bandages,\" Bart said\r\nimpatiently.\r\n\r\n\"All in good time. Any trouble breathing?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, except for the bandages.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fine. I changed the shape of your ears and nostrils, and it might have\r\naffected your hearing or your breathing. Now, listen, Bart: I'm going to\r\ntake the bandages off your hands first. Sit down.\"\r\n\r\nBart sat across the table from him, obediently sticking out his hands.\r\nRaynor Three said, \"Shut your eyes.\"\r\n\r\nBart did as he was told and felt Raynor Three's long fingers working at\r\nthe bandages.\r\n\r\n\"Move each finger as I touch it.\" Bart obeyed, and Raynor said\r\nneutrally, \"Good. Now, take a deep breath and then open your eyes.\"\r\n\r\nImpatiently Bart flicked his lids open. In spite of the warning, his\r\nbreath went out in a harsh, jolting gasp. His hands lay on the table\r\nbefore him--but they were not his hands.\r\n\r\nThe narrow, long fingers were pearl-gray, tipped with whitish-pink claws\r\nthat curved out over the tips. Nervously Bart moved one finger, and the\r\nlong claw flicked out like a cat's, retracted. He swallowed.\r\n\r\n\"Golly!\" He felt strangely wobbly.\r\n\r\n\"A beautiful job, if I do say so. Be careful not to scratch yourself,\r\nand practice picking up small things.\"\r\n\r\nBart saw that the long grayish claws were trembling. \"How did you\r\nmake--the claws?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite simple, really,\" Raynor beamed. \"I injected protein compounds\r\ninto the nail matrix, which speeded up nail growth terrifically, and\r\nthen, as they grew, shaped them. Joining on those tiny muscles for the\r\nretracting mechanism was the tricky part though.\"\r\n\r\nBart was moving his hands experimentally. Once over the shock, they felt\r\nquite normal. The claws didn't get in his way half so much as he'd\r\nexpected when he picked up a pen that lay beside him and, with the blunt\r\ntip, made a few of the strange-looking dots and wedges that were the\r\nLhari alphabet.\r\n\r\n\"Practice writing this,\" said Raynor Three, and laid a plastic-encased\r\nfolder down beside him. It was a set of ship's papers printed in Lhari.\r\nBart read it through, seeing that it was made out to the equivalent of\r\nAstrogator, First Class, Bartol.\r\n\r\n\"That's your name now, the name your father would have used. Memorize\r\nit, get used to the sound of it, practice writing it. Don't worry too\r\nmuch about the rating; it's an elementary one, what we'd call Apprentice\r\nrating, and I have a training tape for you anyhow. My brother got hold\r\nof it, don't ask me how--and don't ask him!\"\r\n\r\n\"When am I going to see my face?\"\r\n\r\n\"When I think you're ready for the shock,\" Raynor said bluntly. \"It\r\nalmost threw you when I showed you your hands.\"\r\n\r\nHe made Bart walk around some more briefly, slowly, he unwound the\r\nbandages; then turned and picked up a mirror at the bottom of his\r\nmedic's case, turning it right side up. \"Here. But take it easy.\"\r\n\r\nBut when Bart looked in the mirror he felt no unexpected shock, only an\r\nunnerving revulsion.\r\n\r\nHis hair was bleached-white and fluffy, almost feathery to the touch.\r\nHis skin was grayish-rose, and his eyelids had been altered just enough\r\nto make his eyes look long, narrow and slanted. His nostrils were mere\r\nslits, and he moved his tongue over lips that felt oddly thin.\r\n\r\n\"I did as little to your teeth as I thought I could get away with-capped\r\nthe front ones,\" Raynor Three told him. \"So if you get a toothache\r\nyou're out of luck--you won't dare go to a Lhari dentist. I could have\r\ndone more, but it would have made you look too freakish when we changed\r\nyou back to human again--if you live that long,\" he added grimly.\r\n\r\n_I hadn't thought about that. And if Raynor is going to forget me, who\r\nwill do it?_ The cold knot of fear, never wholly absent, moved in him\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nWatching his face, Raynor Three said gently, \"It's a big network, Bart.\r\nI'm not telling you much, for your own safety. But when you get to\r\nAntares, they'll tell you all you need to know.\"\r\n\r\nHe lifted Bart's oddly clawed hands. \"I warned you, remember--the change\r\nisn't completely reversible. Your hands will always look--strange. The\r\nfingers had to be lengthened, for instance. I wanted to make you as safe\r\nas possible among the Lhari. I think you'll pass anything but an X-ray.\r\nJust be careful not to break any bones.\"\r\n\r\nHe gave Bart a package. \"This is the Lhari training tape. Listen to it\r\nas often as you can, then destroy it--_completely_--before you leave\r\nhere. The _Swiftwing_ is due in port three days from now, and they stay\r\nhere a week. I don't know how we'll manage it, but I'll guarantee\r\nthere'll be a vacancy of one Astrogator, First Class, on that ship.\" He\r\nrose. \"And now I'm going back to town and erase the memory.\" He stopped,\r\nlooking intently at Bart.\r\n\r\n\"So if you see me, stay away from me and don't speak, because I won't\r\nknow you from any other Lhari. Understand? From here on, you're on your\r\nown, Bart.\"\r\n\r\nHe held out his hand. \"This is the rough part, Son.\" His face moved\r\nstrangely. \"I'm part of this network between the stars, but I don't know\r\nwhat I've done before, and I'll never know how it comes out. It's funny\r\nto stand here and look at you and realize that I won't even remember\r\nyou.\" The gold-glinted eyes blinked rapidly. \"Goodbye, Bart. And--good\r\nluck, Son.\"\r\n\r\nBart took his hand, deeply moved, with the strange sense that this was\r\nanother death--a worse one than Briscoe's. He tried to speak and\r\ncouldn't.\r\n\r\n\"Well--\" Raynor's mouth twisted into a wry grin. \"Ouch! Careful with\r\nthose claws. The Lhari don't shake hands.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned abruptly and went out of the door and out of Bart's life,\r\nwhile Bart stood at the dome-window, feeling alone as he had never felt\r\nalone before.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe had to wait six days, and they felt like six eternities. He played\r\nthe training tape over and over. With his Academy background, it wasn't\r\nnearly so difficult as he'd feared. He read and reread the set of papers\r\nidentifying him as Astrogator, First Class, Bartol. Forged, he supposed.\r\nOr was there, somewhere, a real Bartol?\r\n\r\nThe last morning he slept uneasily late. He finished his last meal as a\r\nhuman, spent part of the day removing all traces of his presence from\r\nRaynor's home, burned the training tape, and finally got into the silky,\r\nsilvery tights and cloak that Raynor had provided. He could use his\r\nhands now as if they belonged to him; he even found the claws handy and\r\nuseful. He could write his signature, and copy out instructions from the\r\ntraining tape, without a moment's hesitation.\r\n\r\nToward dusk, a young Lhari slipped unobserved out of Raynor's house and\r\nhiked unnoticed to the edges of a small city nearby, where he mingled\r\nwith the crowd and hired a skycab from an unobservant human driver to\r\ntake him to the spaceport city. The skycab driver was startled, but not,\r\nBart judged, unusually so, to pick up a Lhari passenger.\r\n\r\n\"Been doing a little sight-seeing on our planet, hey?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right,\" Bart said in Universal, not trying to fake his idea of\r\nthe Lhari accent. Raynor had told him that only a few of the Lhari had\r\nthat characteristic sibilant \"r\" and \"s\" and warned him against trying\r\nto imitate it. _Just speak naturally; there are dialects of Lhari, just\r\nas there are dialects of the different human languages, and they all\r\nsound different in Universal anyhow._ \"Just looking around some.\"\r\n\r\nThe skycab driver frowned and looked down at his controls, and Bart felt\r\ncuriously snubbed. Then he remembered. He himself had little to say to\r\nthe Lhari when they spoke to him.\r\n\r\n_He was an alien, a monster. He couldn't expect to be treated like a\r\nhuman being any more._\r\n\r\nWhen the skycab let him off before the spaceport, it felt strange to see\r\nhow the crowds edged away from him as he made a way through them. He\r\ncaught a glimpse of himself in one of the mirror-ramps, a tall thin\r\nstrange form in a metallic cloak, head crested with feathery white, and\r\nfelt overwhelmingly homesick for his own familiar face.\r\n\r\nHe was beginning to feel hungry, and realized that he could not go into\r\nan ordinary restaurant without attracting attention. There were\r\nrefreshment stands all over the spaceport, and he briefly considered\r\ngetting a snack at one of these.\r\n\r\nNo, that was just putting it off. The time had to come when he must face\r\nhis fear and test his disguise among the Lhari themselves. Reviewing his\r\nknowledge of the construction of spaceports, he remembered that one side\r\nwas the terminal, where humans and visitors and passengers were freely\r\nadmitted; the other side, for Lhari and their Mentorian employees only,\r\ncontained--along with business offices of many sorts--a sort of arcade\r\nwith amusement centers, shops and restaurants catering to the personnel\r\nof the Lhari ships. With nine or ten ships docking every day, Raynor had\r\nassured him that a strange Lhari face would be lost in the crowds very\r\neasily.\r\n\r\nHe went to one of the doors marked DANGER, LHARI LIGHTS BEYOND, and\r\npassed through the glaring corridor of offices and storage-warehouses,\r\nfinally coming out into a sort of wide mall. The lights were fierce, but\r\nhe could endure them without trouble now, though his head ached faintly.\r\nRaynor, testing his light tolerance, had assured him that he could endure\r\nanything the Lhari could, without permanent damage to his optic nerves,\r\nthough he would have headaches until he got used to them.\r\n\r\nThere were small shops and what looked like bars, and a glass-fronted\r\nplace with a sign lettered largely, in black letters, a Lhari phrase\r\nmeaning roughly HOME AWAY FROM HOME: MEALS SERVED, SPACEMEN WELCOME,\r\nREASONABLE.\r\n\r\nBehind him a voice said in Lhari, \"Tell me, does that sign mean what it\r\nsays? Or is this one of those traps for separating the unwary spaceman\r\nfrom his hard-earned credits? How's the food?\"\r\n\r\nBart carefully took hold of himself.\r\n\r\n\"I was just wondering that myself.\" He turned as he spoke, finding\r\nhimself face to face with a young Lhari in the unadorned cloak of a\r\nspaceman without official rank. He knew the Lhari was young because his\r\ncrest was still white.\r\n\r\nThe young Lhari extended his claws in the closed-fist, hidden-claw\r\ngesture of Lhari greeting. \"Shall we take a chance? Ringg son of Rahan\r\ngreets you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bartol son of Berihun.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't remember seeing you in the port, Bartol.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've mostly worked on the Polaris run.\"\r\n\r\n\"Way off there?\" Ringg son of Rahan sounded startled and impressed. \"You\r\nreally get around, don't you? Shall we sit here?\"\r\n\r\nThey sat on triangular chairs at a three-cornered table. Bart waited for\r\nRingg to order, and ordered what he did. When it came, it was a sort of\r\negg-and-fish casserole which Bart found extremely tasty, and he dug into\r\nit with pleasure. Allowing for the claws, Lhari table manners were not\r\nso much different from human--_and remember, their customs differ as\r\nmuch as ours do. If you do something differently, they'll just think\r\nyou're from another planet with a different culture._\r\n\r\n\"Have you been here long?\"\r\n\r\n\"A day or so. I'm off the _Swiftwing_.\"\r\n\r\nBart decided to hazard his luck. \"I was told there's a vacancy on the\r\n_Swiftwing_.\"\r\n\r\nRingg looked at him curiously. \"There is,\" he said, \"but I'd like to\r\nknow how you found it out. Captain Vorongil said that anyone who talked\r\nabout it would be sent to Kleeto for three cycles. But what happened to\r\nyou? Miss your ship?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I've just been laying off--traveling, sight-seeing, bumming\r\naround,\" Bart said. \"But I'm tired of it, and now I'd like to sign out\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we could use another man. This is the long run we're making, out\r\nto Antares and then home, and if everybody has to work extra shifts,\r\nit's no fun. But if old Vorongil knows that there's been talk in the\r\nport about Klanerol jumping ship, or whatever happened to him, we'll all\r\nhave to walk wide of his temper.\"\r\n\r\nBart was beginning to relax a little; Ringg apparently accepted him\r\nwithout scrutiny. At this close range Ringg did not seem a monster, but\r\njust a young fellow like himself, hearty, good-natured--in fact, not\r\nunlike Tommy.\r\n\r\nBart chased the thought away as soon as it sneaked into his brain--one\r\nof those _things_, like _Tommy_? Then, rather grimly, he reminded\r\nhimself, _I'm one of those things_. He said irritably, \"So how do I\r\naccount for asking your captain for the place?\"\r\n\r\nRingg cocked his fluffy crest to one side. \"I know,\" he said, \"_I_ told\r\nyou. I'll say you're an old friend of mine. You don't know what\r\nVorongil's like when he gets mad. But what he doesn't know, he won't\r\nshout about.\" He shoved back the triangular chair. \"Who _did_ tell you,\r\nanyway?\"\r\n\r\nThis was the first real hurdle, and Bart's brain raced desperately, but\r\nRingg was not listening for an answer. \"I suppose somebody gossiped, or\r\none of those fool Mentorians picked it up. Got your papers? What\r\nrating?\"\r\n\r\n\"Astrogator first class.\"\r\n\r\n\"Klanerol was second, but you can't have everything, I suppose.\" Ringg\r\nled the way through the arcades, out across a guarded sector, passing\r\nhalf a dozen of the huge ships lying in their pits. Finally Ringg\r\nstopped and pointed. \"This is the old hulk.\"\r\n\r\nBart had traveled only in Lhari passenger ships, which were new and\r\nfresh and sleek. This ship was enormous, ovoid like the egg of some\r\nspace-monster, the sides dented and discolored, thin films of chemical\r\ndiscoloration lying over the glassy metallic hull.\r\n\r\nBart followed Ringg. This was real, it was happening. He was signing out\r\nfor his first interstellar cruise on one of the Lhari ships. Not a\r\nMentorian assistant, half-trusted, half-tolerated, but one of the crew\r\nthemselves. _If I'm lucky_, he reminded himself grimly.\r\n\r\nThere was Lhari, in the black-banded officer's cloak, at the doorway. He\r\nglanced at Ringg's papers.\r\n\r\n\"Friend of mine,\" Ringg said, and Bart proffered his folder. The Lhari\r\ngave it a casual glance, handed it back.\r\n\r\n\"Old Baldy on board?\" Ringg asked.\r\n\r\n\"Where else?\" The officer laughed. \"You don't think _he'd_ relax with\r\ncargo not loaded, do you?\"\r\n\r\nThey seemed casual and normal, and Bart's confidence was growing. They\r\nhad accepted him as one of themselves. But the great ordeal still lay\r\nbefore him--an interview with the Lhari captain. And the idea had Bart\r\nsweating scared.\r\n\r\nThe corridors and decks seemed larger, wider, more spacious, but\r\nshabbier than on the clean, bright, commercial passenger decks Bart had\r\nseen. Dark-lensed men were rolling bales of cargo along on wheeled\r\ndollies. The corridors seemed endless. More to hear the sound of his own\r\nvoice, and reassure himself of his ability to speak and be understood,\r\nthan because he cared, he asked Ringg, \"What's your rating?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, according to the logbooks, I'm an Expert Class Two,\r\nMetals-Fatigue,\" said Ringg. \"That sounds very technical and\r\ninteresting. But what it means is just that I go all over the ship inch\r\nby inch, and when I finish, start all over again at the other end. Most\r\nof what I do is just boss around the maintenance crews and snarl at them\r\nabout spots of rust on the paint.\"\r\n\r\nThey got into a small round elevator and Ringg punched buttons; it began\r\nto rise, slowly and creakily, toward the top. \"This, for instance,\"\r\nRingg said. \"I've been yelling for a new cable for six months.\" He\r\nturned. \"Take it easy, Bartol; don't let Vorongil scare you. He likes to\r\nhear the sound of his own voice, but we'd all walk out the lock without\r\nspacesuits for him.\"\r\n\r\nThe elevator slid to a stop. The sign in Lhari letters said _Level of\r\nAdministration--Officers' Deck_. Ringg pushed at a door and said,\r\n\"Captain Vorongil?\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought you were on leave,\" said a Lhari voice, deeper and slower\r\nthan most. \"What are you doing, back here more than ten milliseconds\r\nbefore strap-in checks?\"\r\n\r\nRingg stepped back for Bart to go inside. The small cabin, with an\r\nelliptical bunk slung from the ceiling and a triangular table, was\r\ndwarfed by a tall, thin Lhari, in a cloak with four of the black bands\r\nthat seemed to denote rank among them. He had a deeply lined face with a\r\nlacework of tiny wrinkles around the slanted eyes. His crest was not the\r\nhigh, fluffy white of a young Lhari, but broken short near the scalp,\r\ngrayish pink showing through, the little feathery ends yellowed with\r\nage. He growled, \"Come in then, don't stand there. I suppose Ringg's\r\ntold you what a tyrant I am? What do you want, feathertop?\"\r\n\r\nBart remembered being told that this was the Lhari equivalent of \"Kid\"\r\nor \"Youngster.\" He fumbled in the capacious folds of his cloak for his\r\npapers. His voice sounded shrill, even to himself.\r\n\r\n\"Bartol son of Berihun in respectful greeting, _rieko mori_.\"\r\n(\"Honorable old-bald-one,\" the Lhari equivalent of \"sir.\") \"Ringg told\r\nme there is a vacancy among the Astrogators, and I want to sign out.\"\r\n\r\nUnmistakably, Vorongil's snort was laughter.\r\n\r\n\"So you've been talking, Ringg?\"\r\n\r\nRingg retorted, \"Better that I tell one man than that you have to hunt\r\nthe planet over--or run the long haul with the drive-room watches short\r\nby one man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well, you're right,\" Vorongil growled. He glared at Bart. \"On the\r\nlast planet, one of our men disappeared. Jumped ship!\" The creases\r\naround his eyes deepened, troubled. \"Probably just gone on the drift,\r\nsight-seeing, but I wish he'd told me. As it is, I wonder if he's been\r\nhurt, killed, kidnaped.\"\r\n\r\nRingg said, \"Who'd dare? It would be reported.\"\r\n\r\nBart knew, with a cold chill, that the missing Klanerol had not simply\r\ngone \"on the drift.\" No Lhari port would ever see Klanerol, Second Class\r\nAstrogator, again.\r\n\r\n\"Bartol,\" mused the captain, riffling the forged papers. \"Served on the\r\nPolaris run. Hm--you _are_ a good long way off your orbit, aren't you?\r\nNever been out that way myself. All right, I'll take you on. You can do\r\nsystem programming? Good. Rating in Second Galaxy mathematics?\"\r\n\r\nHe nodded, hauled out a sheet of thin, wax-coated fabric and his claws\r\nmade rapid imprints in the surface. He passed it to Bart, pointed. Bart\r\nhesitated, and Vorongil said impatiently, \"Standard agreement, no hidden\r\nclauses. Put your mark on it, feathertop.\"\r\n\r\nBart realized it was something like a fingerprint they wanted. _You'll\r\npass anything but X-rays._ He pressed the top of one claw into the wax.\r\nVorongil nodded, shoved it on a shelf without looking at it.\r\n\r\n\"So much for that,\" said Ringg, laughing, as they came out. \"The Bald\r\nOne was in a good temper. I'm going to the port and celebrate, not that\r\nthis dim place is very festive. You?\"\r\n\r\n\"I--I think I'll stay aboard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if you change your mind, I'll be down there somewhere,\" Ringg\r\nsaid. \"See you later, shipmate.\" He raised his closed fist in farewell,\r\nand went.\r\n\r\nBart stood in the corridor, feeling astounded and strange. He _belonged_\r\nhere! He had a right to be on board the ship! He wasn't quite sure what\r\nto do next.\r\n\r\nA Lhari, as short and fat as a Lhari could possibly be and still be a\r\nLhari, came or rather waddled out of the captain's office. He saw Bartol\r\nand called, \"Are you the new First Class? I'm Rugel, coordinator.\"\r\n\r\nRugel had a huge cleft darkish scar across his lip, and there were two\r\nbands on his cloak. He was completely bald, and he puffed when he\r\nwalked. \"Vorongil asked me to show you around. You'll share quarters\r\nwith Ringg--no sense shifting another man. Come down and see the chart\r\nrooms--or do you want to leave your kit in your cabin first?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't have much,\" Bart said.\r\n\r\nRugel's seamed lip widened. \"That's the way--travel light when you're on\r\nthe drift,\" he confirmed.\r\n\r\nRugel took him down to the drive rooms, and here for a moment, in wonder\r\nand awe, Bart almost forgot his disguise. The old Lhari led him to the\r\nhuge computer which filled one wall of the room, and Bart was smitten\r\nwith the universality of mathematics. Here was something he _knew_ he\r\ncould handle.\r\n\r\nHe could do this programming, easily enough. But as he stood before the\r\nbanks of complex, yet beautifully familiar levers, the sheer exquisite\r\ncomplexity of it overcame him. To compute the movements of thousands of\r\nstars, all moving at different speeds in different directions in the\r\nvast swirling directionless chaos of the Universe--and yet to be sure\r\nthat every separate movement would come out to within a quarter of a\r\nmile! It was something that no finite brain--man or Lhari--could ever\r\naccomplish, yet their limited brains had built these computers that\r\n_could_ do it.\r\n\r\nRugel watched him, laughing softly. \"Well, you'll have enough time down\r\nhere. I like to have youngsters who are still in the middle of a love\r\naffair with their work. Come along, and I'll show you your cabin.\"\r\n\r\nRugel left him in a cabin amidships; small and cramped, but tidy, two of\r\nthe oval bunks slung at opposite ends, a small table between them, and\r\ndrawers filled with pamphlets and manuals and maps. Furtively, ashamed\r\nof himself, yet driven by necessity, Bart searched Ringg's belongings,\r\nwanting to get some idea of what possessions he ought to own. He looked\r\naround the shower and toilet facilities with extra care--this was\r\nsomething he _couldn't_ slip up on and be considered even halfway\r\nnormal. He was afraid Ringg would come in, and see him staring curiously\r\nat something as ordinary, to a Lhari, as a cake of soap.\r\n\r\nHe decided to go down to the port again and look around the shops. He\r\nwas not afraid of being unable to handle his work. What he feared was\r\nsomething subtler--that the small items of everyday living, something as\r\nsimple as a nail file, would betray him.\r\n\r\nOn his way he looked into the Recreation Lounge, filled with comfortable\r\nseats, vision-screens, and what looked like simple pinball machines and\r\nmechanical games of skill. There were also stacks of tapereels and\r\nheadsets for listening, not unlike those humans used. Bart felt\r\nfascinated, and wanted to explore, but decided he could do that later.\r\n\r\nSomehow he took the wrong turn coming out of the Recreation Lounge, and\r\nwent through a door where the sudden dimming of lights told him he was\r\nin Mentorian quarters. The sudden darkness made him stumble, thrust out\r\nhis hands to keep from falling, and an unmistakably human voice said,\r\n\"Ouch!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" Bart said in Universal, without thinking.\r\n\r\n\"I admit the lights are dim,\" said the voice tartly, and Bart found\r\nhimself looking down, as his eyes adjusted to the new light level, at a\r\ngirl.\r\n\r\nShe was small and slight, in a metallic blue cloak that swept out, like\r\nwings, around her thin shoulders; the hood framed a small, kittenlike\r\nface. She was a Mentorian, and she was human, and Bart's eyes rested\r\nwith comfort on her face; she, on the other hand, was looking up with\r\nanxiety and uneasy distrust. _That's right--I'm a Lhari, a nonhuman\r\nfreak!_\r\n\r\n\"I seem to have missed my way.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you looking for, sir? The medical quarters are through here.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm looking for the elevator down to the crew exits.\"\r\n\r\n\"Through here,\" she said, reopening the door through which he had come,\r\nand shading her large, lovely, long-lashed eyes with a slender hand.\r\n\"You took the wrong turn. Are you new on board? I thought all ships were\r\nlaid out exactly alike.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've only worked on passenger ships.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe they are somewhat different,\" said the girl in good Lhari.\r\n\"Well, that is your way, sir.\"\r\n\r\nHe felt as if he had been snubbed and dismissed.\r\n\r\n\"What is your name?\"\r\n\r\nShe stiffened as if about to salute. \"Meta of the house of Marnay Three,\r\nsir.\"\r\n\r\nBart realized he was doing something wholly out of character for a\r\nLhari--chatting casually with a Mentorian. With a wistful glance at the\r\npretty girl, he said a stiff \"Thank you\" and went down the ramp she had\r\nindicated. He felt horribly lonely. Being a freak wasn't going to be\r\nmuch fun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nHe saw the girl again next day, when they checked in for blastoff. She\r\nwas seated at a small desk, triangular like so much of the Lhari\r\nfurniture, checking a register as they came out of the Decontam room,\r\nmaking sure they downed their greenish solution of microorganisms.\r\n\r\n\"Papers, please?\" She marked, and Bart noticed that she was using a red\r\npencil.\r\n\r\n\"Bartol,\" she said aloud. \"Is that how you pronounce it?\" She made small\r\nscribbles in a sort of shorthand with the red pencil, then made other\r\nmarks with the black one in Lhari; he supposed the red marks were her\r\nown private memoranda, unreadable by the Lhari.\r\n\r\n\"Next, please.\" She handed a cup of the greenish stuff to Ringg, behind\r\nhim. Bart went down toward the drive room, and to his own surprise,\r\nfound himself wishing the girl were a mathematician rather than a medic.\r\nIt would have been pleasant to watch her down there.\r\n\r\nOld Rugel, on duty in the drive room, watched Bart strap himself in\r\nbefore the computer. \"Make sure you check all dials at null,\" he\r\nreminded him, and Bart felt a last surge of panic.\r\n\r\nThis was his first cruise, except for practice runs at the Academy! Yet\r\nhis rating called him an experienced man on the Polaris run. He'd had\r\nthe Lhari training tape, which was supposed to condition his responses,\r\nbut would it? He tried to clench his fists, drove a claw into his palm,\r\nwinced, and commanded himself to stay calm and keep his mind on what he\r\nwas doing.\r\n\r\nIt calmed him to make the routine check of his dials.\r\n\r\n\"Strapdown check,\" said a Lhari with a yellowed crest and a rasping\r\nvoice. \"New man, eh?\" He gave Bart's straps perfunctory tugs at\r\nshoulders and waist, tightened a buckle. \"Karol son of Garin.\"\r\n\r\nBells rang in the ship, and Bart felt the odd, tonic touch of fear.\r\n_This was it._\r\n\r\nVorongil strode through the door, his banded cloak sweeping behind him,\r\nand took the control couch.\r\n\r\n\"Ready from fueling room, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Position,\" Vorongil snapped.\r\n\r\nBart heard himself reading off a string of figures in Lhari. His voice\r\nsounded perfectly calm.\r\n\r\n\"Communication.\"\r\n\r\n\"Clear channels from Pylon Dispatch, sir.\" It was old Rugel's voice.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" Vorongil said, slowly and almost reflectively, \"let's take her\r\nup then.\"\r\n\r\nHe touched some controls. The humming grew. Then, swift, hard and\r\ncrushing, weight mashed Bart against his couch.\r\n\r\n\"Position!\" Vorongil's voice sounded harsh, and Bart fought the crushing\r\nweight of it. Even his eyeballs ached as he struggled to turn the tiny\r\neye muscles from dial to dial, and his voice was a dim croak: \"Fourteen\r\nseven sidereal twelve point one one four nine....\"\r\n\r\n\"Hold it to point one one four six,\" Vorongil said calmly.\r\n\r\n\"Point one one four six,\" Bart said, and his claws stabbed at dials.\r\nSuddenly, in spite of the cold weight on his chest, the pain, the\r\nstruggle, he felt as if he were floating. He managed a long, luxurious\r\nbreath. He _could_ handle it. He knew what he was doing.\r\n\r\n_He was an Astrogator...._\r\n\r\nLater, when Acceleration One had reached its apex and the artificial\r\ngravity made the ship a place of comfort again, he went down to the\r\ndining hall with Ringg and met the crew of the _Swiftwing_. There were\r\ntwelve officers and twelve crewmen of various ratings like himself and\r\nRingg, but there seemed to be little social division between them, as\r\nthere would have been on a human ship; officers and crew joked and\r\nargued without formality of any kind.\r\n\r\nNone of them gave him a second look. Later, in the Recreation Lounge,\r\nRingg challenged him to a game with one of the pinball machines. It\r\nseemed fairly simple to Bart; he tried it, and to his own surprise, won.\r\n\r\nOld Rugel touched a lever at the side of the room. With a tiny whishing\r\nsound, shutters opened, the light of Procyon Alpha flooded them and he\r\nlooked out through a great viewport into bottomless space.\r\n\r\nProcyon Alpha, Beta and Gamma hung at full, rings gently tilted. Beyond\r\nthem the stars burned, flaming through the shimmers of cosmic dust. The\r\ncolors, the never-ending colors of space!\r\n\r\nAnd he stood here, in a room full of monsters--_he was one of the\r\nmonsters_--\r\n\r\n\"Which one of the planets was it we stopped on?\" Rugel asked. \"I can't\r\ntell 'em apart from this distance.\"\r\n\r\nBartol swallowed; he had almost said _the blue one_. He pointed.\r\n\"The--the big one there, with the rings almost edge-on. I think they\r\ncall it Alpha.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's their planet,\" said Rugel. \"I guess they can call it what they\r\nwant to. How about another game?\"\r\n\r\nResolutely, Bart turned his back on the bewitching colors, and bent over\r\nthe pinball machine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe first week in space was a nightmare of strain. He welcomed the hours\r\non watch in the drive room; there alone he was sure of what he was\r\ndoing. Everywhere else in the ship he was perpetually scared,\r\nperpetually on tiptoe, perpetually afraid of making some small and\r\nstupid mistake. Once he actually called Aldebaran a red star, but Rugel\r\neither did not hear the slip or thought he was repeating what one of the\r\nMentorians--there were two aboard besides the girl--had said.\r\n\r\nThe absence of color from speech and life was the hardest thing to get\r\nused to. Every star in the manual was listed by light-frequency waves,\r\nto be checked against a photometer for a specific reading, and it almost\r\ndrove Bart mad to go through the ritual when the Mentorians were off\r\nduty and could not call off the color and the equivalent frequency type\r\nfor him. Yet he did not dare skip a single step, or someone might have\r\nguessed that he could _see_ the difference between a yellow and a green\r\nstar before checking them.\r\n\r\nThe Academy ships had had the traditional human signal system of\r\nflashing red lights. Bart was stretched taut all the time, listening for\r\nthe small codelike buzzers and ticks that warned him of filled tanks,\r\nleads in need of servicing, answers ready. Ringg's metal-fatigues\r\ntesting kit was a bewildering muddle of boxes, meters, rods and\r\nearphones, each buzzing and clicking its characteristic warning.\r\n\r\nAt first he felt stretched to capacity every waking moment, his memory\r\naching with a million details, and lay awake nights thinking his mind\r\nwould crack under the strain. Then Alpha faded to a dim bluish shimmer,\r\nBeta was eclipsed, Gamma was gone, Procyon dimmed to a failing spark;\r\nand suddenly Bart's memory accustomed itself to the load, the new habits\r\nwere firmly in place, and he found himself eating, sleeping and working\r\nin a settled routine.\r\n\r\nHe belonged to the _Swiftwing_ now.\r\n\r\nProcyon was almost lost in the viewports when a sort of upswept tempo\r\nbegan to run through the ship, an undercurrent of increased activity.\r\nCargo was checked, inventoried and strapped in. Ringg was given four\r\nextra men to help him, made an extra tour of the ship, and came back\r\nbuzzing like a frantic cricket. Bart's computers told him they were\r\nforging toward the sidereal location assigned for the first of the\r\nwarp-drive shifts, which would take them some fifteen light-years toward\r\nAldebaran.\r\n\r\nOn the final watch before the warp-drive shift, the medical officer came\r\naround and relieved the Mentorians from duty. Bart watched them go, with\r\na curious, cold, crawling apprehension. Even the Mentorians, trusted by\r\nthe Lhari--even these were put into cold-sleep! Fear grabbed his\r\ninsides.\r\n\r\n_No human had ever survived the shift into warp-drive_, the Lhari said.\r\nBriscoe, his father, Raynor Three--they thought they had proved that the\r\nLhari lied. If they were right, if it was a Lhari trick to reinforce\r\ntheir stranglehold on the human worlds and keep the warp-drive for\r\nthemselves, then Bart had nothing to fear. But he was afraid.\r\n\r\nWhy did the Mentorians endure this, never quite trusted, isolated among\r\naliens?\r\n\r\nRaynor Three had said, _Because I belong in space, because I'm never\r\nhappy anywhere else_. Bart looked out the viewport at the swirl and burn\r\nof the colors there. Now that he could never speak of the colors, it\r\nseemed he had never been so wholly and wistfully aware of them. They\r\nsymbolized the thing he could never put into words.\r\n\r\n_So that everyone can have this. Not just the Lhari._\r\n\r\nRugel watched the Mentorians go, scowling. \"I wish medic would find a\r\nway to keep them alive through warp,\" he said. \"My Mentorian assistant\r\ncould watch that frequency-shift as we got near the bottom of the arc,\r\nand I'll bet she could _see_ it. They can see the changes in intensity\r\nfaster than I can plot them on the photometer!\"\r\n\r\nBart felt goosebumps break out on his skin. Rugel spoke as if the\r\ncertain death of humans, Mentorians, was a fact. Didn't the Lhari\r\nthemselves know it was a farce? _Or was it?_\r\n\r\nVorongil himself took the controls for the surge of Acceleration Two,\r\nwhich would take them past the Light Barrier. Bart, watching his\r\ninstruments to exact position and time, saw the colors of each star\r\nshift strangely, moment by moment. The red stars seemed hard to see. The\r\norange-yellow ones burned suddenly like flame; the green ones seemed\r\ngolden, the blue ones almost green. Dimly, he remembered the old story\r\nof a \"red shift\" in the lights of approaching stars, but here he saw it\r\npure, a sight no human eyes had ever seen. A sight that _no_ eyes had\r\nseen, human or otherwise, for the Lhari could not see it....\r\n\r\n\"Time,\" he said briefly to Vorongil, \"Fifteen seconds....\"\r\n\r\nRugel looked across from his couch. Bart felt that the old, scarred\r\nLhari could read his fear. Rugel said through a wheeze, \"No matter how\r\nold you get, Bartol, you're still scared when you make a warp-shift. But\r\nrelax, computers don't make mistakes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Catalyst,\" Vorongil snapped, \"Ready--_shift!_\"\r\n\r\nAt first there was no change; then Bart realized that the stars, through\r\nthe viewport, had altered abruptly in size and shade and color. They\r\nwere not sparks but strange streaks, like comets, crossing and\r\nrecrossing long tails that grew, longer and longer, moment by moment.\r\nThe dark night of space was filled with a crisscrossing blaze. They were\r\nmoving faster than light, they saw the light left by the moving Universe\r\nas each star hurled in its own invisible orbit, while they tore\r\nincredibly through it, faster than light itself....\r\n\r\nBart felt a curious, tingling discomfort, deep in his flesh; almost an\r\nitching, a stinging in his very bones.\r\n\r\n_Lhari flesh is no different from ours...._\r\n\r\nSpace, through the viewport, was no longer space as he had come to know\r\nit, but a strange eerie limbo, the star-tracks lengthening, shifting\r\ncolor until they filled the whole viewport with shimmering, gray,\r\nrecrossing light. The unbelievable reaction of warp-drive thrust them\r\nthrough space faster than the lights of the surrounding stars, faster\r\nthan imagination could follow.\r\n\r\nThe lights in the drive chamber began to dim--or was he blacking out?\r\nThe stinging in his flesh was a clawed pain.\r\n\r\nBriscoe lived through it....\r\n\r\n_They say._\r\n\r\nThe whirling star-tracks fogged, coiled, turned colorless worms of\r\nlight, went into a single vast blur. Dimly Bart saw old Rugel slump\r\nforward, moaning softly; saw the old Lhari pillow his bald head on his\r\nveined arms. Then darkness took him; and thinking it was death, Bart\r\nfelt only numb, regretful failure. _I've failed, we'll always fail. The\r\nLhari were right all long._\r\n\r\n_But we tried! By God, we tried!_\r\n\r\n\"Bartol?\" A gentle hand, cat claws retracted, came down on his shoulder.\r\nRingg bent over him. Good-natured rebuke was in his voice. \"Why didn't\r\nyou tell us you got a bad reaction, and ask to sign out for this shift?\"\r\nhe demanded. \"Look, poor old Rugel's passed out again. He just won't\r\nadmit he can't take it--but one idiot on a watch is enough! Some people\r\njust feel as if the bottom's dropped out of the ship, and that's all\r\nthere is to it.\"\r\n\r\nBart hauled his head upright, fighting a surge of stinging nausea. His\r\nbones itched inside and he was damnably uncomfortable, but he was alive.\r\n\r\n\"I'm--fine.\"\r\n\r\n\"You look it,\" Ringg said in derision. \"Think you can help me get Rugel\r\nto his cabin?\"\r\n\r\nBart struggled to his feet, and found that when he was upright he felt\r\nbetter. \"Wow!\" he muttered, then clamped his mouth shut. He was supposed\r\nto be an experienced man, a Lhari hardened to space. He said woozily,\r\n\"How long was I out?\"\r\n\r\n\"The usual time,\" Ringg said briskly, \"about three seconds--just while\r\nwe hit peak warp-drive. Feels longer, so they tell me, sometimes--time's\r\nfunny, beyond light-speeds. The medic says it's purely psychological.\r\nI'm not so sure. I _itch_, blast it!\"\r\n\r\nHe moved his shoulders in a squirming way, then bent over Rugel, who was\r\nmoaning, half insensible. \"Catch hold of his feet, Bartol. Here--ease\r\nhim out of his chair. No sense bothering the medics this time. Think you\r\ncan manage to help me carry him down to the deck?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure,\" Bart said, finding his feet and his voice. He felt better as\r\nthey moved along the hallway, the limp, muttering form of the old Lhari\r\ninsensible in their arms. They reached the officer's deck, got Rugel\r\ninto his cabin and into his bunk, hauled off his cloak and boots. Ringg\r\nstood shaking his head.\r\n\r\n\"And they say Captain Vorongil's so tough!\"\r\n\r\nBart made a questioning noise.\r\n\r\n\"Why, just look,\" said Ringg. \"He knows it would make poor old Rugel\r\nfeel as if he wasn't good for much--to order him into his bunk and make\r\nhim take dope like a Mentorian for every warp-shift. So we have this to\r\ngo through at every jump!\" He sounded cross and disgusted, but there was\r\na rough, boyish gentleness as he hauled the blanket over the bald old\r\nLhari. He looked up, almost shyly.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks for helping me with Old Baldy. We usually try to get him out\r\nbefore Vorongil officially takes notice. Of course, he sort of keeps his\r\nback turned,\" Ringg said, and they laughed together as they turned back\r\nto the drive room. Bart found himself thinking, _Ringg's a good kid_,\r\nbefore he pulled himself up, in sudden shock.\r\n\r\nHe _had_ lived through warp-drive! Then, indeed, the Lhari had been\r\nlying all along, the vicious lie that maintained their stranglehold\r\nmonopoly of star-travel. He was their enemy again, the spy within their\r\ngates, like Briscoe, to be hunted down and killed, but to bring the\r\nmessage, loud and clear, to everyone: _The Lhari lied! The stars can\r\nbelong to us all!_\r\n\r\nWhen he got back to the drive room, he saw through the viewport that the\r\nblur had vanished, the star-trails were clear, distinct again, their\r\ncomet-tails shortening by the moment, their colors more distinct.\r\n\r\nThe Lhari were waiting, a few poised over their instruments, a few more\r\nstanding at the quartz window watching the star-trails, some squirming\r\nand scratching and grousing about \"space fleas\"--the characteristic\r\nitching reaction that seemed to be deep down inside the bones.\r\n\r\nBart checked his panels, noted the time when they were due to snap back\r\ninto normal space, and went to stand by the viewport. The stars were\r\nreappearing, seeming to steady and blaze out in cloudy splendor through\r\nthe bright dust. They burned in great streamers of flame, and for the\r\nmoment he forgot his mission again, lost in the beauty of the fiery\r\nlights. He drew a deep, shaking gasp. It was worth it all, to see this!\r\nHe turned and saw Ringg, silent, at his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Me, too,\" Ringg said, almost in a whisper. \"I think every man on board\r\nfeels that way, a little, only he won't admit it.\" His slanted gray eyes\r\nlooked quickly at Bart and away.\r\n\r\n\"I guess we're almost down to L-point. Better check the panel and report\r\nnulls, so medic can wake up the Mentorians.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Swiftwing_ moved on between the stars. Aldebaran loomed, then faded\r\nin the viewports; another shift jumped them to a star whose human name\r\nBart did not know. Shift followed shift, spaceport followed spaceport,\r\nsun followed sun; men lived on most of these worlds, and on each of them\r\na Lhari spaceport rose, alien and arrogant. And on each world men looked\r\nat Lhari with resentful eyes, cursing the race who kept the stars for\r\ntheir own.\r\n\r\nCargo amassed in the holds of the _Swiftwing_, from worlds beyond all\r\ndreams of strangeness. Bart grew, not bored, but hardened to the\r\nincredible. For days at a time, no word of human speech crossed his\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nThe blackout at peak of each warp-shift persisted. Vorongil had given\r\nhim permission to report off duty, but since the blackouts did not\r\nimpair his efficiency, Bart had refused. Rugel told him that this was\r\nthe moment of equilibrium, the peak of the faster-than-light motion.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps a true limiting speed beyond which nothing will ever go,\"\r\nVorongil said, touching the charts with a varnished claw. Rugel's\r\nscarred old mouth spread in a thin smile.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe there's no such thing as a limiting speed. Someday we'll reach\r\ntrue simultaneity--enter warp, and come out just where we want to be, at\r\nthe same time. Just a split-second interval. That will be real\r\ntransmission.\"\r\n\r\nRingg scoffed, \"And suppose you get even better--and come out of warp\r\n_before_ you go into it? What then, Honorable Bald One?\"\r\n\r\nRugel chuckled, and did not answer. Bart turned away. It was not easy to\r\nkeep on hating the Lhari.\r\n\r\nThere came a day when he came on watch to see drawn, worried faces; and\r\nwhen Ringg came into the drive room they threw their levers on\r\n_automatic_ and crowded around him, their crests bobbing in question and\r\ndismay. Vorongil seemed to emit sparks as he barked at Ringg, \"You found\r\nit?\"\r\n\r\n\"I found it. Inside the hull lining.\"\r\n\r\nVorongil swore, and Ringg held up a hand in protest. \"I only _locate_\r\nmetals fatigue, sir--I don't _make_ it!\"\r\n\r\n\"No help for it then,\" Vorongil said. \"We'll have to put down for\r\nrepairs. How much time do we have, Ringg?\"\r\n\r\n\"I give it thirty hours,\" Ringg said briefly, and Vorongil gave a long\r\nshrill whistle. \"Bartol, what's the closest listed spaceport?\"\r\n\r\nBart dived for handbooks, manuals, comparative tables of position, and\r\nstarted programming information. The crew drifted toward him, and by the\r\ntime he finished feeding in the coded information, a row three-deep of\r\nLhari surrounded him, including all the officers. Vorongil was right at\r\nhis shoulder when Bart slipped on his earphones and started decoding the\r\npunched strips that fed out the answers from the computer.\r\n\r\n\"Nearest port is Cottman Four. It's almost exactly thirty hours away.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't like to run it that close.\" Vorongil's face was bitten deep\r\nwith lines. He turned to Ramillis, head of Maintenance. \"Do we need\r\nspare parts? Or just general repairs?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just repairs, sir. We have plenty of shielding metal. It's a long job\r\nto get through the hulls, but there's nothing we can't fix.\"\r\n\r\nVorongil flexed his clawed hands nervously, stretching and retracting\r\nthem. \"Ringg, you're the fatigue expert. I'll take your word for it. Can\r\nwe make thirty hours?\"\r\n\r\nRingg looked pale and there was none of his usual boyish nonsense when\r\nhe said, \"Captain, I swear I wouldn't risk Cottman. You know what\r\ncrystallization's like, sir. We can't get through that hull lining to\r\nrepair it in space, if it _does_ go before we land. We wouldn't have the\r\nchance of a hydrogen atom in a tank of halogens.\"\r\n\r\nVorongil's slanted eyebrows made a single unbroken line. \"That's the\r\nword then. Bartol, find us the closest star with a planet--spaceport or\r\nnot.\"\r\n\r\nBart's hands were shaking with sudden fear. He checked each digit of\r\ntheir present position, fed it into the computer, waited, finally wet\r\nhis lips and plunged, taking the strip from a computer.\r\n\r\n\"This small star, called Meristem. It's a--\" he bit his lip, hard; he\r\nhad almost said _green_--\"type Q, two planets with atmosphere within\r\ntolerable limits, not classified as inhabited.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who owns it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't have that information on the banks, sir.\"\r\n\r\nVorongil beckoned the Mentorian assistant. So apart were Lhari and\r\nMentorian on these ships that Bart did not even know his name. He said,\r\n\"Look up a star called Meristem for us.\" The Mentorian hurried away,\r\ncame back after a moment with the information that it belonged to the\r\nSecond Galaxy Federation, but was listed as unexplored.\r\n\r\nVorongil scowled. \"Well, we can claim necessity,\" he said. \"It's only\r\neight hours away, and Cottman's thirty. Bartol, plot us a warp-drive\r\nshift that will land us in that system, and on the inner of the two\r\nplanets, within nine hours. If it's a type Q star, that means dim\r\nillumination, and no spaceport mercury-vapor installations. We'll need\r\nas much sunlight as we can get.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the first time that Bart, unaided, had had the responsibility of\r\nplotting a warp-drive shift. He checked the coordinates of the small\r\ngreen star three times before passing them along to Vorongil. Even so,\r\nwhen they went into Acceleration Two, he felt stinging fear. _If I\r\nplotted wrong, we could shift into that crazy space and come out\r\nbillions of miles away...._\r\n\r\nBut when the stars steadied and took on their own colors, the blaze of a\r\nsmall green sun was steady in the viewport.\r\n\r\n\"Meristem,\" Vorongil said, taking the controls himself. \"Let's hope the\r\nplace is really uninhabited and that catalogue's up to date, lads. It\r\nwouldn't be any fun to burn up some harmless village, or get shot at by\r\nbarbarians--and we're setting down with no control-tower signals and no\r\nspaceport repair crews. So let's hope our luck holds out for a while\r\nyet.\"\r\n\r\nBart, feeling the minute, unsteady trembling somewhere in the\r\nship--_Imagination_, he told himself, _you can't feel metal-fatigue\r\nsomewhere in the hull lining_--echoed the wish. He did not know that he\r\nhad already had the best luck of his unique voyage, or realize the\r\nfantastic luck that had brought him to the small green star Meristem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe crews of repairmen were working down in the hull, and the\r\n_Swiftwing_ was a hell of clanging noise and shuddering heat.\r\nMaintenance was working overtime, but the rest of the crew, with nothing\r\nto do, stood around in the recreation rooms, tried to play games, cursed\r\nthe heat and the dreary dimness through the viewports, and twitched at\r\nthe boiler-factory racket from the holds.\r\n\r\nToward the end of the third day, the biologist reported air, water and\r\ngravity well within tolerable limits, and Captain Vorongil issued\r\npermission for anyone who liked, to go outside and have a look around.\r\n\r\nBart had a sort of ship-induced claustrophobia. It was good to feel\r\nsolid ground under his feet and the rays of a sun, even a green sun, on\r\nhis back. Even more, it was good to get away from the constant presence\r\nof his shipmates. During this enforced idleness, their presence\r\noppressed him unendurably--so many tall forms, gray skins, feathery\r\ncrests. He was always alone; for a change, he felt that he'd like to be\r\nalone without Lhari all around him.\r\n\r\nBut as he moved away from the ship, Ringg dropped out of the hatchway\r\nand hailed him. \"Where are you going?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just for a walk.\"\r\n\r\nRingg drew a deep breath of weariness. \"That sounds good. Mind if I come\r\nalong?\"\r\n\r\nBart did, but all he could say was, \"If you like.\"\r\n\r\n\"How about let's get some food from the rations clerk, and do some\r\nexploring?\"\r\n\r\nThe sun overhead was a clear greenish-gold, the sky strewn with soft\r\npale clouds that cast racing shadows on the soft grass underfoot,\r\nfragrant pinkish-yellow stuff strewn with bright vermilion puff-balls.\r\nBart wished he were alone to enjoy it.\r\n\r\n\"How are the repairs coming?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pretty well. But Karol got his hand half scorched off, poor fellow.\r\nJust luck the same thing didn't happen to me.\" Ringg added. \"You know\r\nthat Mentorian--the young one, the medic's assistant?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've seen her. Her name's Meta, I think.\" Suddenly, Bart wished the\r\nMentorian girl were with him here. It would be nice to hear a human\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, is it a female? Mentorians all look alike to me,\" Ringg said, while\r\nBart controlled his face with an effort. \"Be that as it may, she saved\r\nme from having the same thing happen. I was just going to lean against a\r\nstrip of sheet metal when she _screamed_ at me. Do you think they can\r\nreally _see_ heat vibrations? She called it _red_-hot.\"\r\n\r\nThey had reached a line of tall cliffs, where a steep rock-fall divided\r\noff the plain from the edge of the mountains. A few slender, drooping,\r\ngold-leaved trees bent graceful branches over a pool. Bart stood\r\nfascinated by the play of green sunlight on the emerald ripples, but\r\nRingg flung himself down full length on the soft grass and sighed\r\ncomfortably. \"Feels good.\"\r\n\r\n\"Too comfortable to eat?\"\r\n\r\nThey munched in companionable silence. \"Look,\" said Ringg at last,\r\npointing toward the cliffs, \"Holes in the rocks. Caves. I'd like to\r\nexplore them, wouldn't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"They look pretty gloomy to me. Probably full of monsters.\"\r\n\r\nRingg patted the hilt of his energon-ray. \"This will handle anything\r\nshort of an armor-plated saurian.\"\r\n\r\nBart shuddered. As part of uniform, he, too, had been issued one of the\r\nenergon-rays; but he had never used it and didn't intend to. \"Just the\r\nsame, I'd rather stay out here in the sun.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's better than vitamin lamps,\" Ringg admitted, \"even if it's not very\r\nbright.\"\r\n\r\nBart wondered, suddenly and worriedly, about the effects of green\r\nsunburn on his chemically altered skin tone.\r\n\r\n\"Well, let's enjoy it while we can,\" Ringg said, \"because it seems to be\r\nclouding over. I wouldn't be surprised if it rained.\" He yawned. \"I'm\r\ngetting bored with this voyage. And yet I don't want it to end, because\r\nthen I'll have to fight it out all over again with my family. My father\r\nowns a hotel, and he wants me in the family business, not five hundred\r\nlight-years away. None of our family have ever been spacemen before,\" he\r\nexplained, \"and they don't understand that living on one planet would\r\ndrive me out of my mind.\" He sighed. \"How did you explain it to your\r\npeople--that you couldn't be happy in the mud? Or are you a career man?\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess so. I never thought about doing anything else,\" Bart said\r\nslowly, Ringg's story had touched him; he had never realized quite so\r\nfully how much alike the two races were, how human the Lhari problems\r\nand dreams could seem. _Why, of course, the Lhari aren't all spacemen.\r\nThey have hotel keepers and garbage men and dentists just as we do.\r\nFunny, you never think of them except in space._\r\n\r\n\"My mother died when I was very young,\" Bart said, choosing his words\r\nvery carefully. \"My father owned a fleet of interplanetary ships.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you wanted the real thing, deep space, the stars,\" Ringg said. \"How\r\ndid he feel about that?\"\r\n\r\n\"He would have understood,\" Bart said, unable to keep emotion out of his\r\nvoice, \"but he's dead now. He died, not long ago.\"\r\n\r\nRingg's eyes were bright with sympathy. \"While you were off on the\r\ndrift? Bad luck,\" he said gently. He was silent, and when he spoke again\r\nit was in a very different tone.\r\n\r\n\"But some of the older generation--I had a professor in training school,\r\nfunny old chap, bald as the hull of the _Swiftwing_. Taught us\r\ncosmic-ray analysis, and what he didn't know about spiral nebulae could\r\nbe engraved on my fifth toe-claw, and he'd never been off the face of\r\nthe planet. Not even to one of the moons! He was the supervisor of my\r\nstudent lodge, and oh, was he a--\" The phrase Ringg used meant,\r\nliterally, _a soft piece of cake_.\r\n\r\n\"His feet may have been buried in mud, but his head was off in the Great\r\nNebula. We had some wild times,\" Ringg reminisced. \"We'd slip away to\r\nthe city--strictly against rules, it was an old-style school--and draw\r\nlots for one of us to stay home and sign in for all twelve. You see,\r\nhe'd sit there reading, and when one of us came in, just shove the wax\r\nat us, with his nose in a text on cosmic dust, never looking up. So the\r\none who stayed home would scrawl a name on it, walk out the back door,\r\ncome around and sign in again. When there were twelve signed in, of\r\ncourse, the old chap would go up to bed, and late that night the one who\r\nstayed in would sneak down and let us in.\"\r\n\r\nRingg sat up suddenly, touching his cheek. \"Was that a drop of rain? And\r\nthe sun's gone. I suppose we ought to start back, though I hate to leave\r\nthose caves unexplored.\"\r\n\r\nBart bent to gather up the debris of their meal. He flinched as\r\nsomething hard struck his arm. \"Ouch! What was that?\"\r\n\r\nRingg cried out in pain. \"It's hail!\"\r\n\r\nSharp pieces of ice were suddenly pelting, raining down all around them,\r\nsplattering the ground with a harsh, bouncing clatter. Ringg yelled,\r\n\"Come on--it's big enough to _flatten_ you!\"\r\n\r\nIt looked to Bart as if it were at least golf-ball size, and seemed to\r\nbe getting bigger by the moment. Lightning flashed around them in sudden\r\nglare. They ducked their heads and ran.\r\n\r\n\"Get in under the lee of the cliffs. We couldn't possibly make it back\r\nto the _Swift_--\" Ringg's voice broke off in a cry of pain; he slumped\r\nforward, pitched to his knees, then slid down and lay still.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter?\" Bart, arm curved to protect his skull, bent over\r\nthe fallen Lhari, but Ringg, his forehead bleeding, lay insensible. Bart\r\nfelt sharp pain in his arm, felt the hail hard as thrown stones raining\r\non his head. Ringg was out cold. _If they stayed in this_, Bart thought\r\ndespairingly, _they'd both be dead!_\r\n\r\nCrouching, trying to duck his head between his shoulders, Bart got his\r\narms under Ringg's armpits and half-carried, half-dragged him under the\r\nlee of the cliffs. He slipped and slid on the thickening layer of ice\r\nunderfoot, lost his footing, and came down, hard, one arm twisted\r\nbetween himself and the cliff. He cried out in pain, uncontrollably, and\r\nlet Ringg slip from his grasp. The Lhari boy lay like the dead.\r\n\r\nBart bent over him, breathing hard, trying to get his breath back. The\r\nhail was still pelting down, showing no signs of lessening. About five\r\nfeet away, one of the dark gaps in the cliff showed wide and menacing,\r\nbut at least, Bart thought, the hail couldn't come in there. He stooped\r\nand got hold of Ringg again. A pain like fire went through the wrist he\r\nhad smashed against the rock. He set his teeth, wondering if it had\r\nbroken. The effort made him see stars, but he managed somehow to hoist\r\nRingg up again and haul him through the pelting hail toward the yawning\r\ngap. It darkened around them, and, blessedly, the battering, bruising\r\nhail could not reach them. Only an occasional light splinter of ice blew\r\nwith the bitter wind into the mouth of the cave.\r\n\r\nBart laid Ringg down on the floor, under the shelter of the rock\r\nceiling. He knelt beside him, and spoke his name, but Ringg just moaned.\r\nHis forehead was covered with blood.\r\n\r\nBart took one of the paper napkins from the lunch sack and carefully\r\nwiped some of it away. His stomach turned at the deep, ugly cut, which\r\nimmediately started oozing fresh blood. He pressed the edges of the cut\r\ntogether with the napkin, wondering helplessly how much blood Ringg\r\ncould lose without danger, and if he had concussion. If he tried to go\r\nback to the ship and fetch the medic for Ringg, he'd be struck by hail\r\nhimself. From where he stood, it seemed that the hailstones were getting\r\nbigger by the minute.\r\n\r\nRingg moaned, but when Bart knelt beside him again he did not answer.\r\nBart could hear only the rushing of wind, the noise of the splattering\r\nhail and a sound of water somewhere--_or was that a rustle of scales, a\r\ndragging of strange feet?_ He looked through the darkness into the\r\ndepths of the cave, his hand on his shock-beam. He was afraid to turn\r\nhis back on it.\r\n\r\n_This is nonsense,_ he told himself firmly, _I'll just walk back there\r\nand see what there is._\r\n\r\nAt his belt he had the small flashlamp, excessively bright, that was,\r\nlike the energon-beam shocker, a part of regulation equipment. He took\r\nit out, shining it on the back wall of the cave; then drew a long breath\r\nof startlement and for a moment forgot Ringg and his own pain.\r\n\r\nFor the back wall of the cave was an exquisite fall of crystal! Minerals\r\nglowed there, giant crystals, like jewels, crusted with strange\r\nlichen-like growths and colors. There were pale blues and greens and,\r\nshimmering among them, a strangely colored crystalline mineral that he\r\nhad never seen before. It was blue--_No_, Bart thought, _that's just the\r\nlight, it's more like red--no, it can't be like_ both _of them at once,\r\nand it isn't really like either. In this light--_\r\n\r\nRingg moaned, and Bart, glancing round, saw that he was struggling to\r\nsit up. He ran back to him, dropping to his knees at Ringg's side. \"It's\r\nall right, Ringg, lie still. We're under cover now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wha' happened?\" Ringg said blurrily. \"Head hurts--all sparks--all the\r\npretty lights--can't _see_ you!\" He fumbled with loose, uncoordinated\r\nfingers at his head and Bart grabbed at him before he poked a claw in\r\nhis eye. \"Don't _do_ that,\" Ringg complained, \"can't _see_--\"\r\n\r\n_He must have a bad concussion then. That's a nasty cut._ Gently, he\r\nrestrained the Lhari boy's hands.\r\n\r\n\"Bartol, what happened?\"\r\n\r\nBart explained. Ringg tried to move, but fell limply back.\r\n\r\n\"Weren't you hurt? I thought I heard you cry out.\"\r\n\r\n\"A cut or two, but nothing serious,\" Bart said. \"I think the hail's\r\nstopped. Lie still, I'd better go back to the ship and get help.\"\r\n\r\n\"Give me a hand and I can walk,\" Ringg said, but when he tried to sit\r\nup, he flinched, and Bart said, \"You'd better lie still.\" He knew that\r\nhead injuries should be kept very quiet; he was almost afraid to leave\r\nRingg for fear the Lhari boy would have another delirious fit and hurt\r\nhimself, but there was no help for it.\r\n\r\nThe hail had stopped, and the piled heaps were already melting, but it\r\nwas bitterly cold. Bart wrapped himself in the silvery cloak, glad of\r\nits warmth, and struggled back across the slushy, ice-strewn meadow that\r\nhad been so pink and flowery in the sunshine. The _Swiftwing_, a\r\nmonstrous dark egg looming in the twilight, seemed like home. Bart felt\r\nthe heavenly warmth close around him with a sigh of pure relief, but the\r\nSecond Officer, coming up the hatchway, stopped in consternation:\r\n\r\n\"You're covered with blood! The hailstorm--\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm all right,\" Bart said, \"but Ringg's been hurt. You'll need a\r\nstretcher.\" Quickly, he explained. \"I'll come with you and show you--\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll do no such thing,\" the officer said. \"You look as if you'd been\r\ncaught out in a meteor shower, feathertop! We can find the place. You go\r\nand have those cuts attended to, and--what's wrong with your wrist?\r\nBroken?\"\r\n\r\nBart heard, like an echo, the frightening words: _Don't break any bones.\r\nYou won't pass an X-ray._\r\n\r\n\"It's all right, sir. When I get washed up--\"\r\n\r\n\"That's an _order_,\" snapped the officer, \"do you think, on this\r\npestilential unlucky planet, we can afford any _more_ bad luck? Metals\r\nfatigue, Karol burned so badly the medic thinks he may never use his\r\nhand again, and now you and Ringg getting yourselves laid up and out of\r\naction? The medic will help me with Ringg; that Mentorian girl can look\r\nafter you. Get moving!\"\r\n\r\nHe hurried away, and Bart, his head beginning to hurt, walked slowly up\r\nthe ramp. His whole arm felt numb, and he supported it with his good\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nIn the small infirmary, Karol lay groaning in a bunk, his arm bound in\r\nbandages, his head moving from side to side. The Mentorian girl Meta\r\nturned, charging a hypo. She looked pale and drawn. She went to Karol,\r\nuncovering his other arm, and made the injection; almost immediately the\r\nmoaning stopped and Karol lay still. Meta sighed and drew a hand over\r\nher brow, brushing away feathery wisps that escaped from the cap tied\r\nover her hair.\r\n\r\n\"Bartol? You're hurt? Not more burns, I hope?\"\r\n\r\n_She looks just like a fluffy little kitten_, Bart thought\r\nincongruously. Fatigue was beginning to blur his reactions.\r\n\r\n\"Only a few cuts,\" he said, in Universal, though Meta had spoken Lhari.\r\nIn his weariness and pain he was homesick for the sound of a familiar\r\nword. \"Ringg and I were both caught in the hailstorm. He's badly hurt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sit down here.\"\r\n\r\nBart sat. Meta's hands were skillful and cool as she sponged the blood\r\naway from his forehead and sprayed it with some pleasantly cold,\r\nmint-smelling antiseptic. Bart leaned back, tireder than he knew,\r\nhalf-closing his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"That hail must have been enormous; we heard it through the hull.\r\nWhatever possessed you to go out into it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It wasn't hailing when we left,\" Bart said wearily. \"The sun was as\r\nnice and green as it could be.\" He bit the words off, realizing he had\r\nmade a slip, but the girl seemed not to hear, fastening a strip of\r\nplastic over a cut. She picked up his wrist. Bart flinched in spite of\r\nhimself, and Meta nodded. \"I was afraid of that; it may be broken.\r\nBetter let me X-ray it.\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" Bart said harshly. \"It's all right, I just twisted it. Nothing's\r\nbroken. Just strap it up.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's pretty badly swollen,\" the girl said, moving it gently. \"Does that\r\nhurt? I thought so.\"\r\n\r\nBart set his teeth against a cry. \"It's all right, I tell you. Just\r\nbecause it's black and blue--\"\r\n\r\nHe heard her breath jolt out, her fingers clenched painfully on his\r\nwounded wrist. She did not hear his cry this time. \"And the sun was nice\r\nand _green_,\" she whispered. _\"What are you?\"_\r\n\r\nBart felt himself slip sidewise; he thought for a moment that he would\r\nfaint where he sat. Terrified, he looked up at Meta. Their eyes met, and\r\nshe said, hardly moving her pale lips, \"Your eyes--they're like mine.\r\nYour eyelashes--dark, not white. _You're not a Lhari!_\"\r\n\r\nThe pain in his wrist suddenly blurred everything else, but Meta\r\nsuddenly realized she was gripping it; she gave a little, gentle cry,\r\nand cradled the abused wrist in her palm.\r\n\r\n\"No wonder you didn't want it X-rayed,\" she whispered. Biting her lip,\r\nshe glanced, terrified, at Karol, unconscious in the bunk. \"No, he can't\r\nhear us; I gave him a heavy shot of hypnin, poor fellow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go ahead,\" Bart said bitterly, \"yell for your keepers.\"\r\n\r\nHer gray eyes blazed at him for a moment; then, gently, she laid his\r\nwrist on the table, went to the infirmary door and locked it on the\r\ninside. She turned around, her face white; even her lips had lost their\r\ncolor. \"Who are you?\" she whispered.\r\n\r\n\"Does it matter now?\"\r\n\r\nShocked comprehension swept over her face. \"You don't think I'd _tell_\r\nthem,\" she whispered. \"I heard talk, in the Procyon port, of a spy that\r\nhad managed to get through on a Lhari ship.\" Her face twisted. \"You--you\r\nmust know about the man on the _Multiphase_, you know they'll--make sure\r\nI can't--hide anything dangerous to the Lhari at the end of the voyage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Meta--\" concern for her swept over him--\"what will they do to you when\r\nthey find out that you know and--didn't tell?\"\r\n\r\nHer gray eyes were wide as a kitten's. \"Why, nothing. The Lhari would\r\nnever _hurt_ anyone, would they?\"\r\n\r\nBrainwashed? He set his mouth grimly. \"I hope you never find out\r\ndifferent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why would they need to?\" she asked, reasonably. \"They could just erase\r\nthe memory. I never heard of a Lhari actually hurting anyone. But\r\nsomething like this--\" She wavered, looking at him. \"You look so _much_\r\nlike a Lhari! How was it done? How could they do it? Poor fellow, you\r\nmust be the--the loneliest man in the Universe!\"\r\n\r\nHer voice was compassionate. Bart felt his throat tighten, and had the\r\nawful feeling that he was going to cry. He reached with his good hand\r\nfor hers, seeking the comfort of a human touch, but she flinched\r\ninstinctively away.\r\n\r\n_He was a monster to this pretty girl...._\r\n\r\n\"It looks so real,\" she said helplessly. \"Yes, now I can see, you have\r\ntiny moons at the base of the nail, and the Lhari don't.\" Her face\r\nworked. \"It's--it's horrifying! How could you--\"\r\n\r\nThere was a noise in the corridor. Meta gasped and ran to unlock the\r\ndoor, stood back as the medic and the Second Officer came in, staggering\r\nunder Ringg's weight. Carefully, they put him into a bunk. The medic\r\nstraightened, shaking his crest.\r\n\r\n\"Did you get that wrist taken care of, Bartol?\"\r\n\r\nMeta stepped between Bart and the officer, reaching for a roll of\r\nbandage. \"I'm working on it now, _rieko mori_,\" she said. \"It only wants\r\nstrapping up.\" But her fingers trembled as she wound the gauze, pulling\r\neach fold tight.\r\n\r\n\"How's--Ringg?\"\r\n\r\n\"Needs quiet,\" grunted the medic, \"and a few sutures. Lucky you got him\r\nunder cover when you did.\"\r\n\r\nRingg said weakly from his bunk, \"Bartol saved my life. I can think of\r\nplenty who'd have run for cover, instead of staying out in that stuff\r\nlong enough to drag me inside. Thanks, shipmate.\"\r\n\r\nMeta's hand, with a swift hard pressure, lingered on Bart's shoulder as\r\nshe cut the bandage and fastened the end. \"I don't think that will\r\nbother you much now,\" she whispered, fleetingly. \"I didn't dare say it\r\nwas broken or they'd insist on X-rays. If it hurts I'll get you\r\nsomething later for the pain. If you keep it strapped up tight--\"\r\n\r\n\"It will do,\" Bart said aloud. The tight bandage made it feel a little\r\nbetter, but he felt sick and dizzy, and when the medic turned and saw\r\nhim, the officer said brusquely \"Watch off for you, Bartol. I'll fix the\r\nsign-out sheet, but you go to your cabin and get yourself at least four\r\nhours of sleep. _That's an order._\"\r\n\r\nBart stumbled out of the cabin with relief. Safe in his own quarters, he\r\nflung himself down on his bunk, shaking all over. He'd come safely\r\nthrough one more nightmare, one more terror--for the moment! Had he put\r\nMeta in danger, too? Was there no end to this ceaseless fear? Not only\r\nfor himself, but for others, the innocent bystanders who stumbled into\r\nplots they did not understand?\r\n\r\n_You're doing this for the stars. It's bigger than your fear. It's\r\nbigger than you are, or any of the others...._\r\n\r\nHe was beginning to think it was a lot too big for him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TEN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe green-sun Meristem lay far behind them. Karol's burns had healed;\r\nonly a faint pattern on Ringg's forehead showed where six stitches had\r\nclosed the ugly wound in his skull. Bart's wrist, after a few days of\r\nnightmarish pain when he tried to pick up anything heavy, had healed.\r\nTwo more warp-drive shifts through space had taken the _Swiftwing_ far,\r\nfar out to the rim of the known galaxy, and now the great crimson coal\r\nof Antares burned in their viewports.\r\n\r\nAntares had twelve planets, the outermost of which--far away now, at the\r\nfurthest point in its orbit from the point of the _Swiftwing_'s entry\r\ninto the system--was a small captive sun. No larger than the planet\r\nEarth, it revolved every ninety years around its huge primary.\r\n\r\nSmall as it was, it was blazingly blue-white brilliant, and had a tiny\r\nplanet of its own. After their stop on Antares Seven--the largest of the\r\ninhabited planets in this system, where the Lhari spaceport was\r\nlocated--they would make a careful orbit around the great red primary,\r\nand land on the tiny worldlet of the blue-white secondary before leaving\r\nthe Antares system.\r\n\r\nAs Bart watched Antares growing in the viewports, he felt a variety of\r\nemotions. On the one hand, he was relieved that as his voyage in secrecy\r\nneared its official destination, he had as yet not incurred unmasking.\r\n\r\nBut he felt uncertain about his father's co-conspirators. Would they\r\nreturn him to human form and send him back to Vega, his part ended? Or\r\nwould they, unthinkably, demand that he go on into the Lhari Galaxy?\r\nWhat would he do, if they did?\r\n\r\nAt one moment he entertained fantasies of going on into the Lhari\r\nworlds, returning victorious with the secret of their fueling location,\r\nor of the star-drive itself. At another, he could not wait to be free of\r\nit all. He longed for the society of his own people, yet ached to think\r\nthat this voyage between the stars must end so soon.\r\n\r\nThey made planetfall at the largest Lhari spaceport Bart had seen; as\r\nalways, the Second Officer was the first to go through Decontam and\r\nashore, returning with exchanged mail and messages for the _Swiftwing_'s\r\ncrew. He laughed when he gave Bartol a sealed packet. \"So you're not\r\nquite the orphan we've always thought!\"\r\n\r\nBart took it, his heart suddenly pounding, and walked away through the\r\ngroups of officers and crew eagerly debating how they would spend their\r\nport leave. He knew what it would be.\r\n\r\nIt was on the letterhead of Eight Colors, and it contained no message.\r\nOnly an address--and a time.\r\n\r\nHe slipped away unobserved to the Mentorian part of the ship to borrow a\r\ncloak from Meta. She did not ask why he wanted it, and stopped him when\r\nhe would have told her. \"I'd--rather not know.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked very small and very scared, and Bart wished he could comfort\r\nher, but he knew she would shrink from him, repelled and horrified by\r\nhis Lhari skin, hair, claws.\r\n\r\nYet she reached for his hand, gripping it hard in her own dainty one.\r\n\"Bartol, be careful,\" she whispered, then stopped. \"Bartol--that's a\r\nLhari name. What's your real one?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bart. Bart Steele.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good luck, Bart.\" There were tears in her gray eyes.\r\n\r\nWith the blue cloak folded around his face, hands tucked in the slits at\r\nthe side, he felt almost like himself. And as the strange crimson\r\ntwilight folded down across the streets, laden with spicy smells and\r\nlittle, fragrant gusts of wind, he almost savored the sense of being a\r\nconspirator, of playing for high stakes in a network of intrigue between\r\nthe stars. He was off on an adventure, and meant to enjoy it.\r\n\r\nThe address he had been given was a lavish estate, not far from the\r\nspaceport, across a little gleaming lake that shimmered red, indigo,\r\nviolet in the crimson sunset, surrounded by a low wall of what looked\r\nlike purple glass. Bart, moving slowly through the gate, felt that eyes\r\nwere watching him, and forced himself to walk with slow dignity.\r\n\r\nUp the path. Up a low flight of black-marble stairs. A door swung open\r\nand shut again, closing out the red sunset, letting him into a room that\r\nseemed dim after the months of Lhari lights. There were three men in the\r\nroom, but his eyes were drawn instantly to one, standing against an\r\nold-fashioned fireplace.\r\n\r\nHe was very tall and quite thin, and his hair was snow-white, though he\r\ndid not look old. Bart's first incongruous thought was, _He'd make a\r\nbetter Lhari than I would._ His firm, commanding voice told Bart at once\r\nthat this was the man in charge. \"You are Bartol?\" He extended his hand.\r\n\r\nBart took it--and found himself gripped in a judo hold. The other two\r\nmen, leaping to place behind him, felt all over his body, not gently.\r\n\r\n\"No weapons, Montano.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look here--\"\r\n\r\n\"Save it,\" Montano said. \"If you're the right person, you'll understand.\r\nIf not, you won't have much time to resent it. A very simple test. What\r\ncolor is that divan?\"\r\n\r\n\"Green.\"\r\n\r\n\"And those curtains?\"\r\n\r\n\"Darker green, with gold and red figures.\"\r\n\r\nThe men released him, and the white-haired man smiled.\r\n\r\n\"So you actually did it, Steele! I thought for sure the code message was\r\na fake.\" He stepped back and looked Bart over from head to foot,\r\nwhistling. \"Raynor Three is a genius! Claws and everything! What a deuce\r\nof a risk to take though!\"\r\n\r\n\"You know my name,\" Bart said, \"but who are you?\"\r\n\r\nSuspicion came back into the dark eyes. \"Does that Mentorian cloak\r\nmean--you've lost your memories, too?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Bart, \"it's simpler than that. I'm not Rupert Steele.\r\nI'm--\" his voice caught--\"I'm his son.\"\r\n\r\nThe man looked startled and shocked. \"I suppose that means Rupert is\r\ndead. Dead! It came a little before he expected it, then. So you're\r\nBart.\" He sighed. \"My name's Montano. This is Hedrick, and I suppose you\r\nrecognize Raynor Two.\"\r\n\r\nBart blinked. It was the same face, but it was not grim like Raynor\r\nOne's, nor expressive and kindly like that of Raynor Three. This one\r\njust looked dangerous.\r\n\r\n\"But sit down,\" Montano said with a wave of his hand, \"make yourself\r\ncomfortable.\"\r\n\r\nHedrick relieved Bart of his cloak; Raynor Two put a cup of some\r\nsteaming drink in his hand, passed him a tray of small hot fried things\r\nthat tasted crisp and delicious. Bart relaxed, answering questions. _How\r\nold? Only seventeen? And you came all alone on a Lhari ship, working\r\nyour way as Astrogator? I must say you've got guts, kid!_ It was\r\ndangerously like the fantasy he had invented. But Montano interrupted at\r\nlast.\r\n\r\n\"All right, this isn't a party and we haven't all night. I don't suppose\r\nBart has either. Enough time wasted. Since you walked into this, young\r\nSteele, I take it you know what our plans are, after this?\"\r\n\r\nBart shook his head. \"No. Raynor Three sent me to call off your plans,\r\nbecause of my father--\"\r\n\r\n\"That sounds like Three,\" interrupted Raynor Two. \"Entirely too\r\nsqueamish!\"\r\n\r\nMontano said irritably, \"We couldn't have done anything without a man on\r\nthe _Swiftwing_, and you know it. We still can't. Bart, I suppose you\r\nknow about Lharillis.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not by that name.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your next stop. The planetoid of the captive sun. That little hunk of\r\nbare rock out there is the first spot the Lhari visited in this\r\ngalaxy--even before Mentor. It's an inferno of light from that little\r\nblue-white sun, so of course they love it--it's just like home to them.\r\nWhen they found that the inner planets of Antares were inhabited, they\r\nbuilt their spaceport here, so they'd have a better chance at trade.\"\r\nMontano scowled fiercely.\r\n\r\n\"But they wanted that little worldlet. So we went all over it to be sure\r\nthere were no rare minerals there, and finally leased it to them, a\r\ncentury at a time. They mine the place for some kind of powdered\r\nlubricant that's better than graphite--it's all done by robot machinery,\r\nno one's stationed there. Every time a Lhari ship comes through this\r\nsystem they stop there, even though there's nothing on Lharillis except\r\na landing field and some concrete bunkers filled with robot mining\r\nmachinery. They'll stop there on the way out of this system--and that's\r\nwhere you come in. We need you on board, to put the radiation counter\r\nout of commission.\"\r\n\r\nHe took a chart from a drawer, spread it out on a table top. \"The\r\nsimplest way would be to cut these two wires. When the Lhari land, we'll\r\nbe there, waiting for them. On board the Lhari ship, there must be full\r\nrecords--coordinates of their home world, of where they go for their\r\ncatalyst fuel--all that.\"\r\n\r\nBart whistled. \"But won't the crew defend the ship? You can't fight\r\nenergon-ray guns!\"\r\n\r\nMontano's face was perfectly calm. \"No. We won't even try.\" He handed\r\nBart a small strip of pale-yellow plastic.\r\n\r\n\"Keep this out of sight of the Mentorians,\" he said. \"The Lhari won't be\r\nable to see the color, of course. But when it turns orange, take cover.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Radiation-exposure film. It's exactly as sensitive to radiation as you\r\nare. When it starts to turn orange, it's picking up radiation. If you're\r\naboard the ship, get into the drive chambers--they're lead-lined--and\r\nyou'll be safe. If you're out on the surface, you'll be all right inside\r\none of the concrete bunkers. But get under cover before it turns red,\r\nbecause by that time every Lhari of them will be stone-cold dead.\"\r\n\r\nBart let the strip of plastic drop, staring in disbelief at Montano's\r\ncold, cruel face. \"Kill them? Kill a whole _shipload_ of them? That's\r\n_murder_!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not murder. War.\"\r\n\r\n\"We're not at war with the Lhari! We have a treaty with them!\"\r\n\r\n\"The Federation has, because they don't dare do anything else,\" Montano\r\nsaid, his face taking on the fanatic's light, \"but some of us dare do\r\nsomething, some of us aren't going to sit forever and let them strangle\r\nall humanity, hold us down, let us _die_! It's war, Bart, war for\r\neconomic survival. Do you suppose the Lhari would hesitate to kill\r\nanyone if we did anything to hurt their monopoly of the stars? Or didn't\r\nthey tell you about David Briscoe, how they hunted him down like an\r\nanimal--\"\r\n\r\n\"But how do we know that was Lhari policy, and not just--some fanatic?\"\r\nBart asked suddenly. He thought of the death of the elder Briscoe, and\r\nas always he shivered with the horror of it, but for the first time it\r\ncame to him: _Briscoe had provoked his own death. He had physically\r\nattacked the Lhari--threatened them, goaded them to shoot him down in\r\nself-defense!_ \"I've been on shipboard with them for months. They're not\r\nwanton murderers.\"\r\n\r\nRaynor Two made a derisive sound. \"Sounds like it might be Three\r\ntalking!\"\r\n\r\nHedrick growled, \"Why waste time talking? Listen, young Steele, you'll\r\ndo as you're told, or else! Who gave you the right to argue?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quiet, both of you.\" Montano came and laid his arm around Bart's\r\nshoulders, persuasively. \"Bart, I know how you feel. But can't you trust\r\nme? You're Rupert Steele's son, and you're here to carry on what your\r\nfather left undone, aren't you? If you fail now, there may not be\r\nanother chance for years--maybe not in our lifetimes.\"\r\n\r\nBart dropped his head in his hands. _Kill a whole shipload of\r\nLhari--innocent traders? Bald, funny old Rugel, stern Vorongil, Ringg--_\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what to do!\" It was a cry of despair. Bart looked\r\nhelplessly around at the men.\r\n\r\nMontano said, almost tenderly, \"You couldn't side with the Lhari against\r\nmen, could you? Could a son of Rupert Steele do that?\"\r\n\r\nBart shut his eyes, and something seemed to snap within him. His father\r\nhad died for this. He might not understand Montano's reasons, but he had\r\nto believe that Montano had them.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" he said, thickly, \"you can count on me.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he left Montano's house, he had the details of the plan, had\r\nmemorized the location of the device he was to sabotage, and accepted,\r\nfrom Montano, a pair of dark contact lenses. \"The light's hellish out\r\nthere,\" Montano warned. \"I know you're half Mentorian, but they don't\r\neven take their Mentorians out there. They're proud of saying no human\r\nfoot has ever touched Lharillis.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he got back to the Lhari spaceport, Ringg hailed him. \"Where have\r\nyou been? I hunted the whole port for you! I wouldn't join the party\r\ntill you came. What's a pal for?\"\r\n\r\nBart brushed by him without speaking, disregarding Ringg's surprised\r\nstare, and went up the ramp. He reached his own cabin and threw himself\r\ndown in his bunk, torn in two.\r\n\r\nRingg was his friend! Ringg liked him! And if he did what Montano\r\nwanted, Ringg would die.\r\n\r\nRingg had followed him, and was standing in the cabin door, watching him\r\nin surprise. \"Bartol, is something the matter? Is there anything I can\r\ndo? Have you had more bad news?\"\r\n\r\nBart's torn nerves snapped. He raised his head and yelled at Ringg,\r\n\"Yes, there is something! You can quit following me around and just let\r\nme alone for a change!\"\r\n\r\nRingg took a step backward. Then he said, very softly, \"Suit yourself,\r\nBartol. Sorry.\" And noiselessly, his white crest held high, he glided\r\naway.\r\n\r\nBart's resolve hardened. Loneliness had done odd things to him--thinking\r\nof Ringg, a Lhari, one of the freaks who had killed his father, as a\r\nfriend! If they knew who he was, they would turn on him, hunt him down\r\nas they'd hunted Briscoe, as they'd hunted his father, as they'd hounded\r\nhim from Earth to Procyon. He put his scruples aside. He'd made up his\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nThey could all die. What did he care? He was human and he was going to\r\nbe loyal to his own kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ELEVEN\r\n\r\n\r\nBut although he thought he had settled all the conflict, he found that\r\nit returned when he was lying in his bunk, or when he stood in the dome\r\nand watched the stars, while they moved through the Antares system\r\ntoward the captive sun and the tiny planet Lharillis.\r\n\r\n_It's in my power to give this to all men...._\r\n\r\nShould a few Lhari stand in his way?\r\n\r\nHe lay in his bunk brooding, thinking of death, staring at the yellow\r\nradiation badge. _If you fail, it won't be in our lifetime._ He'd have\r\nto go back to little things, to the little ships that hauled piddling\r\ncargo between little planets, while all the grandeur of the stars\r\nbelonged to the Lhari. And if he succeeded, Vega Interplanet could\r\nspread from star to star, a mighty memorial to Rupert Steele.\r\n\r\nOne day Vorongil sent for him. \"Bartol,\" he said, and his voice was not\r\nunkind, \"you and Ringg have always been good friends, so don't be angry\r\nabout this. He's worried about you--says you spend all your spare time\r\nin your bunk growling at him. Is there anything the matter, feathertop?\"\r\n\r\nHe sounded so concerned, so--the word struck Bart with hysterical\r\nhumor--so _fatherly_, that Bart wanted insanely to laugh and to cry.\r\nInstead he muttered, \"Ringg should mind his own business.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it's not like that,\" Vorongil said. \"Look, the _Swiftwing_'s a\r\nworld, young fellow, and a small one. If one being in that world is\r\nunhappy, it affects everyone.\"\r\n\r\nBart had an absurd, painful impulse--to blurt out the incredible truth\r\nto Vorongil, and try to get the old Lhari to understand what he was\r\ndoing.\r\n\r\nBut fear held him silent. He was alone, one small human in a ship of\r\nLhari. Vorongil was frowning at him, and Bart mumbled, \"It's nothing,\r\n_rieko mori_.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you're pining for home,\" Vorongil said kindly. \"Well, it\r\nwon't be long now.\"\r\n\r\nThe glare of the captive sun grew and grew in the ports, and Bart's\r\ndread mounted. He had, as yet, had no opportunity to put the radiation\r\ncounter out of order. It was behind a panel in the drive room, and try\r\nas he might, he could think of no way to get to it unobserved.\r\nSometimes, in sleepless nights, it seemed that would be the best way.\r\nJust let it go. But then the Lhari would detect Montano's ship, and kill\r\nMontano and his men.\r\n\r\nDid he believe that? He had to believe it. It was the only way he could\r\npossibly justify what he was doing.\r\n\r\nAnd then his chance came, as so many chances do when one no longer wants\r\nthem. The Second Officer met him at the beginning of one watch, saying\r\nworriedly, \"Bartol, old Rugel's sick--not fit to be on his feet. Do you\r\nthink you can hold down this shift alone, if I drop in and give you a\r\nhand from time to time?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think so,\" Bart said, carefully not overemphasizing it. The Second\r\nOfficer, by routine, spent half of his time in the drive room, and half\r\nhis time down below in Maintenance. When he left, Bart knew he would\r\nhave at least half an hour, uninterrupted, in the drive room. He ripped\r\nopen the panel, located the wires and hesitated; he didn't quite dare to\r\ncut them outright.\r\n\r\nHe jerked one wire loose, frayed the other with a sharp claw until it\r\nwas almost in shreds and would break with the first surge of current,\r\npulled two more connections loose so that they were not making full\r\ncontact. He closed the panel and brushed dust over it, and when the\r\nSecond Officer came back, Bart was at his own station.\r\n\r\nAs Antares fell toward them in the viewport, he found himself worrying\r\nabout Mentorians. They would be in cold sleep, presumably in a safe part\r\nof the ship, behind shielding, or Montano would have made provisions for\r\nthem. Still, he wished there were a way to warn Meta.\r\n\r\nHe was not on watch when they came into the planetary field of\r\nLharillis, but when he came on shift, he knew at once that the trouble\r\nhad been located. The panel was pulled open, the exposed wires hanging,\r\nand Ringg was facing old Rugel, shouting, \"Listen, Baldy, I won't have\r\nyou accusing me of going light on my work! I checked those panels eight\r\ndays ago! Tell me who's going to be opening the panels in here anyhow?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" Rugel said patiently, \"I'm not accusing you of anything, only\r\nbeing careless, young Ringg. You poke with those buzzing instruments and\r\nthings, maybe once you tear loose some wires.\"\r\n\r\nBart remembered he wasn't supposed to know what was going on. \"What's\r\nthis all about?\"\r\n\r\nIt was Rugel who answered. \"The radiation counter--the planetary one,\r\nnot the one we use in space--is out of order. We don't even need it this\r\nlanding--there's no radiation on Lharillis. If it were the landing gear,\r\nnow, that would be serious. I'm just trying to tell Ringg--\"\r\n\r\n\"He's trying to say I didn't check it.\" Ringg was not to be calmed.\r\n\"It's my professional competence--\"\r\n\r\n\"Forget it,\" Bart said. \"If Rugel isn't sore about it, and if we don't\r\nneed it for landing, why worry?\" He felt like Judas.\r\n\r\n\"Just take a look at my daybook,\" Ringg insisted, \"I checked and marked\r\nit _service fit_! I tell you, somebody was blundering around, opening\r\npanels where they had no business, tore it out by accident, then was too\r\nmuch of a filthy sneak to report it and get it fixed!\"\r\n\r\n\"Bartol was on watch alone one night,\" said the Second Officer, \"but you\r\nwouldn't meddle with panels, would you, Bartol?\"\r\n\r\nBart set his teeth, steadying his breathing, as Ringg turned hopefully\r\nto him. \"Bartol, did you--by mistake, maybe? Because if you did, it\r\nwon't count against your rating, but it means a black mark against\r\nmine!\"\r\n\r\nBart hid his self-contempt in sudden, tense fury. \"No, I didn't! You're\r\ngoing to accuse everybody on the _Swiftwing_, all the way from me to\r\nVorongil, before _you_ can admit a mistake, aren't you? If you want\r\nsomebody to blame, look in a mirror!\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen, you!\" Ringg's pent-up rage exploded. He seized Bart by the\r\nshoulder and Bart moved to throw him off, so that Ringg's outthrust\r\nclaws raked only his forearm. In pure reflex he felt his own claws flick\r\nout; they clinched, closed, scuffled, and he felt his claws rake flesh;\r\nhalf incredulous, saw the thin red line of blood welling from Ringg's\r\ncheek.\r\n\r\nThen Rugel's arms were flung restrainingly around him, and the Second\r\nOfficer was wrestling with a furious, struggling Ringg. Bart looked at\r\nhis red-tipped claws in ill-concealed horror, but it was lost in a\r\ngeneral gasp of consternation, for Vorongil had flung the drive room\r\ndoor open, taking in the scene in one blistering glance.\r\n\r\n_\"What's going on down here?\"_\r\n\r\nFor the first time, Bart understood Vorongil's reputation as a tyrant.\r\nOne glance at Ringg's bleeding face and Bart's ripped forearm, and he\r\ndid not pause for breath for a good fifteen minutes. By the time he\r\nfinished, Bart felt he would rather Ringg's claws had laid him bleeding\r\nto the bone than stand there in the naked contempt of the old Lhari's\r\nfreezing eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Half-fledged nestlings trying to do a man's work! So someone forgot the\r\npanel, or damaged the panel by mistake--no, not another word,\" he\r\ncommanded, as Ringg's crest came proudly up. \"I don't care who did what!\r\nAny more of this, and the one who does it can try his claws on the\r\ncaptain of the _Swiftwing_!\" He looked ugly and dangerous. \"I thought\r\nbetter of you both. Get below, you squalling kittens! Let me not see\r\nyour faces again before we land!\"\r\n\r\nAs they went along the corridor, Ringg turned to Bart, apology and\r\nchagrin in his eyes. \"Look--I never meant to get the Bald One down on\r\nus,\" he said, but Bart kept his face resolutely averted. It was easier\r\nthis way, without pretense of friendship.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe light from the small captive sun grew more intense. Bart had never\r\nknown anything like it, and was glad to slip away and put the dark\r\ncontact lenses into his eyes. They made his eyes appear all enormous,\r\ndilated pupil; fearfully, he hoped no one would notice. His arm smarted,\r\nand he did not speak to Ringg all through the long, slow deceleration.\r\n\r\nWhen the intercom ordered all crew members to the hatchway, Bart\r\nlingered a minute, pinning the yellow radiation badge in a fold of his\r\ncloak. A spasm of fear threatened to overwhelm him again, and\r\nnightmarish loneliness. He felt agonizingly homesick for his own\r\nfamiliar face. It seemed almost more than he could manage, to step out\r\ninto the corridor full of Lhari.\r\n\r\n_It won't be long now._\r\n\r\nThe hatch opened. Even accustomed, as he was, to Lhari lights, Bart\r\nsqueezed his eyes shut at the blue-white brilliance that assaulted him\r\nnow. Then, opening slitted lids cautiously, he found that he could see.\r\n\r\nA weirdly desolate scene stretched away before them. Bare, burning sand,\r\nstrewn with curiously colored rocks, lay piled in strange chaos; then he\r\nrealized there was an odd, but perceptible geometry to their\r\narrangement. They showed alternate crystal and opaque faces. Old Rugel\r\nnoted his look of surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Never been here before? That's right, you've always worked on the\r\nPolaris run. Well, those aren't true rocks, but living creatures of a\r\nsort. The crystals are alive; the opaque faces are lichens that have\r\nsomething like chlorophyll and can make their food from air and\r\nsunlight. The rocks and lichens live in symbiosis. They have\r\nintelligence of a sort, but fortunately they don't mind us, or our\r\nautomatic mining machinery. Every time, though, we find some new lichen\r\nthat's trying to set up a symbiote cycle with the concrete of our\r\nbunkers.\"\r\n\r\n\"And every time,\" Ringg said cheerfully, \"somebody--usually me--has to\r\nsee about having them scraped down and repainted. Maybe someday I'll\r\nfind a paint the lichens don't like the taste of.\"\r\n\r\n\"Going to explore with Ringg?\" Rugel asked, and Ringg, always ready to\r\nlet bygones be bygones, grinned and said, \"Sure!\" Bart could not face\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nVorongil stopped and said, \"This your first time here, young Bartol? How\r\nwould you like to visit the monument with me? You can see the machinery\r\non the way back.\"\r\n\r\nRelieved at not having to go with Ringg, he followed the captain,\r\nfalling into step beside him. They moved in silence, along the smooth\r\nstone path.\r\n\r\n\"The crystal creatures made this road,\" Vorongil said at last. \"I think\r\nthey read minds a little. There used to be a very messy, rocky desert\r\nhere, and we used to have to scrabble and scratch our way to the\r\nmonument. Then one day a ship--not mine--touched down and discovered\r\nthat there was a beautiful smooth road leading up to the monument. And\r\nthe lichens never touch that stone--but you probably had all this in\r\nschool. Excited, Bartol?\"\r\n\r\n\"No--no, sir. Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Eyes look a bit odd. But who could blame you for being excited? I never\r\ncome here without remembering Rhazon and his crew on that long jump. The\r\nlongest any Lhari captain ever made. A blind leap in the dark, remember,\r\nBartol. Through the dark, through the void, with his own crew cursing\r\nhim for taking the chance! No one had ever crossed between galaxies--and\r\nremember, they were using the Ancient Math!\"\r\n\r\nHe paused, and Bart said through a catch of breath. \"Quite an\r\nachievement.\" His badge still looked reassuringly yellow.\r\n\r\n\"You young people have no sense of wonder,\" Vorongil said. \"Not that I\r\nblame you. You can't realize what it was like in those days. Oh, we'd\r\nhad star-travel for centuries, we were beginning to stagnate. And now\r\nlook at us! Oh, they derided Rhazon--said that even if he did find\r\nanyone, any other race, they'd be monsters with whom we could never\r\ncommunicate. But here we have a whole new galaxy for peaceful trade, a\r\nnew mathematics that takes all the hazard out of space travel, our\r\nMentorian friends and allies.\" He smiled. \"Don't tell the High Council\r\non me, but I think they deserve a lot more credit than most Lhari care\r\nto give them. Between ourselves, I think the next Panarch may see it\r\nthat way.\"\r\n\r\nVorongil paused. \"Here's the monument.\"\r\n\r\nIt lay between the crystal columns, tall, of pale blue sandstone, with\r\nletters in deep shadow of such contrast that the Lhari could read them:\r\na high, sheer, imposing stele. Vorongil read the words slowly aloud in\r\nthe musical Lhari language:\r\n\r\n\"'Here, with thanks to Those who Watch the Great Night, I, Rhazon of\r\nNedrun, raise a stone of memory. Here we first do touch the new worlds.\r\nLet us never again fear to face the unknown, trusting that the Mind of\r\nAll Knowledge still has many surprises in store for all the living.'\r\n\r\n\"I think I admire courage more than anything there is, Bartol. Who else\r\ncould have dared it? Doesn't it make you proud to be a Lhari?\"\r\n\r\nBart had felt profoundly moved; now he snapped back to awareness of who\r\nhe was and what he was doing. So only the Lhari had courage? _Life has\r\nsurprises, all right, Captain_, he thought grimly.\r\n\r\nHe glanced down at the badge strip of plastic on his arm. It began to\r\ntinge faint orange as he looked, and a chill of fear went over him. He\r\nhad to get away somehow--get to cover!\r\n\r\nHe looked round and his fear was almost driven from his mind. \"Captain,\r\nthe rocks! They're moving!\"\r\n\r\nVorongil said, unruffled, \"Why, so they are. They do, you know; they\r\nhave intelligence of a sort. Though I've never actually _seen_ them move\r\nbefore, I know they shift places overnight. I wonder what's going on?\"\r\nThey were edging back, the path widening and changing. \"Oh, well, maybe\r\nthey're going to do some more landscaping for us. I once knew a captain\r\nwho swore they could read his mind.\"\r\n\r\nBart saw the slow, inexorable deepening of his badge--he _had_ to get\r\naway. He tensed, impatient; gripped by fists of panic. Somewhere on this\r\nworld, Montano and his men were setting up their lethal radiations....\r\n\r\n_Think of this: a Lhari ship of our own to study, to know how it works,\r\nto see the catalyst and find out where it comes from, to read their\r\nrecords and star routes. Now we know we can use it without dying in the\r\nwarp-drive...._\r\n\r\n_Think of this: to be human again, yet to travel the stars with men of\r\nmy own race!_\r\n\r\n_It's worth a few deaths!_\r\n\r\nEven Vorongil? Standing here, talking to him, he might--_say it! You\r\ntalked to him as if he'd been your father! Oh, Dad, Dad, what would you\r\ndo?_\r\n\r\nHis voice was steady, as he said, \"It's very good of you to show me all\r\nthis, sir, but the other men will call me a slacker. Hadn't I better get\r\nto a work detail?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hm, maybe so, feathertop,\" Vorongil said. \"Let me see--well, down this\r\nway is the last row of bunkers. See the humps? You can check inside to\r\nsee if they're full or empty and save us the trouble of exploring if\r\nthey're all empty. Have a look round inside if you care to--the robot\r\nmachinery's interesting.\"\r\n\r\nBart tensed; he had wondered how he'd get hidden inside, but he asked,\r\n\"Not locked?\"\r\n\r\n\"Locked?\" The old Lhari's short, yellowed crest bobbed in surprise.\r\n\"Why? Who ever comes here but our ships? And what could we do with the\r\nstuff but take it back with us? Why locked? You've been on the drift too\r\nlong--among those thieving humans! It's time you got back to live among\r\ndecent folk again. Well, go along.\"\r\n\r\nThe sting of the words stiffened Bart as he took his leave. The color of\r\nthe badge seemed deeper orange....\r\n\r\n_When it's red, you're dead._\r\n\r\n_It's true. The Lhari don't steal. They don't even seem to understand\r\ndishonesty._\r\n\r\n_But they lied--lied to us all...._\r\n\r\n_Knowing what we were like, maybe! That we'd steal their ships, their\r\nsecrets, their lives!_\r\n\r\nThe deepening color of the badge seemed the one visible thing in a\r\nstrange glaring world. He walked along the row of bunkers, realizing he\r\nneed not check if they were full or empty--the Lhari wouldn't live long\r\nenough to harvest their better-than-graphite lubricant. They'd be dead.\r\n\r\nThe last bunker was empty. He looked at his orange badge and stepped\r\ninside, heart pounding so loudly he thought it was an external sound--it\r\n_was_ an external sound, a step.\r\n\r\n\"Don't move one inch,\" said a voice in Universal, and Bart froze,\r\ntrembling. He looked cautiously round.\r\n\r\nMontano stood there, spacesuited, his head bare, dark contact lenses\r\nblurring his eyes. And in his hand a drawn blaster was held\r\nlevel--trained straight at Bart's heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWELVE\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the first moment of panic, Bart realized Montano could not tell\r\nhim from a Lhari. He remained motionless. \"It's me, Montano--Bart\r\nSteele.\"\r\n\r\nThe man lowered the weapon and put it away. \"You nearly got yourself cut\r\ndown,\" he said. \"Did you make it all right?\" He crossed behind Bart,\r\ninspecting the fastenings of the bunker.\r\n\r\n\"It's just luck I didn't shoot you first and ask questions afterward.\"\r\nMontano drew a deep breath and sat down on the concrete floor. \"Anyway,\r\nwe're safe in here. We've got about half an hour before the radiation\r\nwill reach lethal intensity. It has a very short half-life, though; only\r\nabout twelve minutes. If we spend an hour in here, we'll be safe enough.\r\nDid you have any trouble putting the radiation counter out of\r\ncommission?\"\r\n\r\nSo in half an hour they would all be dead. Ringg, Rugel, Captain\r\nVorongil. Two dozen Lhari, all dead so that Montano could have a Lhari\r\nship to play with.\r\n\r\nAnd what then? More killing, more murder? Would Montano start killing\r\neveryone who tried to get the secret of the drive from him? The Lhari\r\nhad the star-drive; maybe it belonged to them, maybe not. Maybe humans\r\nhad a right to have it, too. But this wasn't the right way. Maybe they\r\ndidn't deserve it.\r\n\r\nHe turned to look at Montano. The man was leaning back, whistling softly\r\nthrough his teeth. He felt like telling Montano that he couldn't go\r\nthrough with it. He started to speak, then stopped, his blood icing\r\nover.\r\n\r\n_If I try to argue with him, I'll never get out of here alive. It means\r\ntoo much to him._\r\n\r\n_Do I just salve my conscience with that then? Sit here and let them\r\ndie?_\r\n\r\nWith a shock of remembrance, it came to Bart that he had a weapon. He\r\nwas armed, this time, with the energon-beam that was part of his\r\nuniform. Montano had evidently forgotten it. _Could_ he kill Montano?\r\nEven to save two dozen Lhari?\r\n\r\nHe reached hesitantly toward the beam-gun, quickly thumbed the catch\r\ndown to the lowest point, which was simple shock. He froze as Montano\r\nlooked in his direction, hand out of sight under his cloak.\r\n\r\n\"How many Lhari on board?\"\r\n\r\n\"Twenty-three, and three Mentorians.\"\r\n\r\n\"Anyone apt to be behind shielding--say, in the drive chamber?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I think they're all outside.\"\r\n\r\nMontano nodded, idly. \"Then we won't have to worry.\"\r\n\r\nBart slipped his hand toward his weapon. Montano saw the movement,\r\ncocked his head in question; then, as understanding flashed over his\r\nface, his hand darted to his own gun. But Bart had pressed the charge of\r\nhis, and Montano slumped over without a cry. He looked so limp that Bart\r\ngasped. Was he dead? Hastily he fumbled the lax hand for a pulse. After\r\na long, endless moment he saw Montano's chest twitch and knew the man\r\nwas breathing.\r\n\r\nWell, Montano would be safe here in the bunker. Hastily, Bart looked at\r\nhis timepiece. Half an hour before the radiation was lethal--_for the\r\nLhari_. Was it already, for him? Shakily, he unfastened the door. He ran\r\nout into the glare, seeing as he ran that his badge was tinged with an\r\never-darkening, gold, orange....\r\n\r\nMontano had said there was a safety margin, but maybe he was wrong,\r\nmaybe all Bart would accomplish would be his own death! He ran back\r\nalong the line of bunkers, his heart pounding with his racing feet. Two\r\ncrewmen came along the line, young white-crested Lhari from the other\r\nwatch. He gasped, \"Where is the captain?\"\r\n\r\n\"Down that way--what's wrong, Bartol?\" But Bart was gone, his muscles\r\naching with the unaccustomed effort inside gravity. Putting on speed, he\r\nsaw the tall, austere shape of Vorongil, his banded cloak dark against\r\nthe glaring light. Vorongil turned, startled, at the sound of his\r\nrunning feet.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, Bart realized that he was still holding his energon-ray. In\r\nshock and revulsion, he dropped it at Vorongil's feet.\r\n\r\n\"Captain, go warn the men! They'll all be dead in half an hour! There\r\nare lethal radiations--\"\r\n\r\n\"_What?_ Are you sunstruck?\"\r\n\r\nBart stopped cold. Never once had it crossed his mind what he would say\r\nto Vorongil or how he would make the captain believe his story, without\r\nrevealing Montano. He started to hold up his badge, realized the Lhari\r\ncaptain could not see color, and dropped it again, while Vorongil bent\r\nover to pick up the fallen gun. \"Are you sunstruck or mad, Bartol?\r\nWhat's this babble?\"\r\n\r\n\"Captain, everybody on the _Swiftwing_--\"\r\n\r\n\"And speak Lhari!\" Vorongil demanded, and Bart realized that in his\r\nexcitement he had been shouting in Universal. He drew a long, deep\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\n\"Captain, there are lethal radiations being released here,\" he said.\r\n\"You have just barely half an hour to gather all the men and get them\r\nbehind shielding.\"\r\n\r\n\"The radiation counter is out of order,\" Vorongil remarked, unruffled.\r\n\"How can you possibly know--\"\r\n\r\nBart stood in despair. Could he say, _A ship has landed here?_ Could he\r\nsay, _Check that bunker?_ Even if Montano was a would-be murderer, he\r\nwas human, and Bart could not betray him to the Lhari. There had been\r\ntoo much betrayal. His voice rose in sudden hysteria.\r\n\r\n\"Captain, there's no time! I tell you, you'll all be dead if you don't\r\nbelieve me! Get the men into the ship! Get them behind shielding and\r\n_then_ check my story! I'm not--\" he had gone this far, he might as well\r\ngo the whole way--\"_I'm not a Lhari!_\"\r\n\r\n_\"What?\"_\r\n\r\nOne of the crewmen came dashing up, his crest sweat-streaked. \"Captain!\r\nRugel has collapsed! We don't know what's wrong with him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Radiation sickness,\" said Bart, and Vorongil reached out, catching his\r\nshoulder in a cruel taloned grip. Bart said desperately \"I'm not a\r\nLhari! I signed on in disguise--I knew they meant to take the ship, but\r\nI can't let you all die.\r\n\r\n\"How can I make you believe me? Here--\" In desperation, Bart reached up.\r\nPain stabbed his eyeballs, fierce, blinding, as he pulled out one of the\r\ncontact lenses. He could not see the captain's face through the light,\r\nbut suddenly two Lhari were holding his arms. The fear of death was on\r\nBart, but it no longer mattered. He saw through watering eyes the\r\never-deepening orange of the badge disappearing.\r\n\r\n\"Here,\" he said, tearing at it, \"radiation. You must be able to see how\r\ndark it is. Even if it's just darkness....\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly Vorongil was shouting, but Bart could not hear. Two men were\r\ndragging him along. They hustled him up the ramp of the ship. He could\r\nsee again, but his eyes were blurred, and he felt sick, colors spinning\r\nbefore his eyes, a nauseated ringing in his head.\r\n\r\nAt first he thought it was his ears ringing; then he made out the\r\nrising, shrieking wail and fall of the emergency siren, steps running,\r\nshouting voices, the slow clang of the doors. Someone was pushing at\r\nhim, babbling words in Lhari, but he heard them through an\r\never-increasing distance: Vorongil's face bent over his, only a blurred\r\ncrimson blob that flashed away like a vanishing star in the viewport. It\r\nflamed out into green darkness, vanished, and Bart fell through what\r\nseemed to be a bottomless chasm of starless night.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen he woke, acceleration had its crushing hand on his chest. He tried\r\nto move, discovered that he was strapped hard into a bunk, and fainted\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the pressure was gone and he was lying at ease on the smooth\r\nsheets of a hospital bunk. His eyes were covered with a light bandage,\r\nand there was a sharp pain in his left arm. He tried to move it and\r\nfound it was tied down.\r\n\r\n\"I think he's coming round,\" said Vorongil's voice.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and a lot too soon for me,\" said a bitter voice which Bart\r\nrecognized as that of the ship's medic. \"Freak!\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen, Baldy,\" said Vorongil, \"whoever he is, he could have been\r\nblinded or killed. You wouldn't be alive now if it wasn't for that\r\n_freak_, as you call him. Bartol, can you hear me? How much light can\r\nyour eyes stand?\"\r\n\r\n\"As much as any Mentorian.\" Bart found he could move his right arm, and\r\ntwitched the bandage away. Vorongil and the medic stood over him; in the\r\nother infirmary bunk a form was lying, covered with a white sheet.\r\nSickly, Bart wondered if they had found Montano. Vorongil followed the\r\ndirection of his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he said, and his voice held deep bitterness, \"poor old Rugel is\r\ndead. He didn't get much of the radiation, but his heart wouldn't stand\r\nit, and gave out.\" He bowed his head. \"He was bald in the service of the\r\nships when my crest was new-sprouted,\" he said in deep grief.\r\n\r\nBart felt the shock of that, even through his own fear. He looked down\r\nat his left arm. It was strapped to a splint, and fluid was dripping\r\nslowly into the vein there.\r\n\r\nVorongil nodded. \"I expect you feel pretty sick. You got a good dose of\r\nradiation yourself, but we've given you a couple of transfusions--one of\r\nthe Mentorians matched your blood type, fortunately. It was a close\r\ncall.\"\r\n\r\nThe medic was looking down in ill-disguised curiosity. \"Fantastic,\" he\r\nsaid. \"I don't suppose you'd tell me who changed your looks. I admit I\r\nwouldn't believe it until I had a look at your foot bones under the\r\nfluoroscope.\"\r\n\r\nVorongil said quietly, \"Bartol--I don't suppose that's your real\r\nname--why did you do it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I couldn't see you all die, sir,\" Bart said, not expecting them to\r\nbelieve him. \"No more than that.\"\r\n\r\nThe medic said roughly in Lhari, \"It's a trick, sir, no more. A trick to\r\nmake us trust him!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why would he risk his own life then?\" Vorongil asked. \"No, it's more\r\nthan that.\" He hesitated. \"We checked the bunkers--in radiation\r\nsuits--before we took off. We found a man in one of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was he dead?\" Bart whispered.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" Vorongil said quietly.\r\n\r\n\"Thank God!\" It was a heartfelt explosion. Then, apprehensively, \"Or did\r\nyou kill him?\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you think we are?\" Vorongil said incredulously. \"Indeed no. His\r\nown men have probably found him by now. I don't imagine he got half as\r\nmuch radiation as you did.\"\r\n\r\nBart surveyed the needle in his arm. \"Why are you taking all this\r\ntrouble if I'm going to be put out of the way?\"\r\n\r\n\"You must have some funny ideas about us,\" Vorongil said shaking his\r\nhead. \"That would be a fine way to reward you for saving all of our\r\nlives. No, you're not going to be killed.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I had my way--\" the old medic began, and suddenly Vorongil flew into\r\na rage. \"Get out!\"\r\n\r\nThe medic went stiffly through the door, and Vorongil stood gazing down\r\nat Bart, shaking his yellowed crest. \"I don't know what to say to you.\r\nIt was a brave thing you did, but perhaps no braver than you've done all\r\nalong. Are you a Mentorian?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only half.\"\r\n\r\n\"Strange,\" Vorongil said, looking into space, \"that I could talk to you\r\nas I did by the monument, and you knew what I meant. But, yes, you would\r\nunderstand.\" Abruptly, he recalled himself, and his voice was thin and\r\ncold.\r\n\r\n\"I haven't quite decided what to do. I haven't spoken of this to the\r\ncrew yet; the fewer who know about this, the better. I told them you got\r\na heavy dose of radiation, and you're too sick to see visitors.\" He\r\nsounded kinder when he said, \"It's true, you know. It won't hurt you to\r\nget your strength back.\"\r\n\r\nHe went out, and Bart wondered, _Get my strength back for what?_ He lay\r\nback, feeling weaker than he realized. It was a relief to know he wasn't\r\ngoing to be killed out of hand. And somehow he didn't believe he was\r\ngoing to be killed at all.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't like being a prisoner. The medic brought him plenty of food,\r\nurging him to eat--\"You need plenty of protein after radiation\r\nburns\"--and if he stayed in the bunk, it was only because he felt too\r\nweak to get up. Actually he was suffering from delayed emotional shock,\r\nas well as from radiation. He was content to let things drift.\r\n\r\nInevitably, the time came when he had to think about what he had done.\r\nHe had betrayed Montano, he had been false to the men who sent him.\r\n\r\n\"But they don't know the Lhari,\" his conscience replied, justifying what\r\nhe had done.\r\n\r\n_You sided with the Lhari against your own people. You spoilt our\r\nchances of learning about the Lhari fuel catalyst._\r\n\r\n\"I've done something better than stealing a secret by stealth. I've\r\nproved that humans and Lhari can communicate, that they can trust each\r\nother. It's only their looks that are strange. A kind, generous man is a\r\nkind generous man, whether his name is Raynor Three or Vorongil.\"\r\n\r\n_But who's going to know it?_\r\n\r\n\"I know it. And truth comes out, sooner or later. Somehow, a better\r\nunderstanding between man and Lhari will come from this.\"\r\n\r\nSecure in the knowledge, he turned over and went peacefully to sleep.\r\n\r\nWhen he woke again, he felt better. The Mentorian girl, Meta, was\r\nsitting quietly between the bunks, watching him. He started to turn\r\nover, flinched at the pain in his arm.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"we're giving you one last transfusion. Plasma, this\r\ntime. It's Lhari, but if you know that much, you know it won't hurt\r\nyou.\" She came and inspected the needle in his wrist, and Bart caught\r\nher hand with his free one. \"Meta, does anyone else know?\"\r\n\r\nShe looked down with a troubled smile. \"I don't think so. I was off\r\nwatch, waiting for cold-sleep--we're just about to make the long\r\njump--when Vorongil came to my quarters. I was startled almost out of my\r\nwits. He asked if I could keep a secret; then he told me about you. Oh,\r\nBart!\" Her small soft hand closed convulsively on his, \"I was so afraid!\r\nI knew they wouldn't kill you, but I was afraid!\"\r\n\r\n_Yet they had killed David Briscoe_, Bart thought, and hunted down two\r\nof his friends. It was the only thing he couldn't square with his\r\nperception of the Lhari. It didn't fit. He could understand that they\r\nhad shot down the robotcab with Edmund Briscoe in it, in pure\r\nself-defense; and that knowledge had taken off the edge of the horror.\r\nBut the death of young Briscoe and everyone he had talked to could not\r\nbe explained away.\r\n\r\n\"You seem very sure they wouldn't have killed me, Meta,\" he said,\r\ncarefully clasping his hand around hers.\r\n\r\n\"They wouldn't,\" she affirmed. \"But they could--make you forget--\"\r\n\r\nA small chill went over Bart. He let go of her hand and lay staring\r\nbleakly at the wall. He supposed that was his probable fate: remembering\r\nthe tragic tone of Raynor Three when he said _I won't remember you_, he\r\ngritted his teeth, feeling his face twist convulsively. Meta, watching,\r\nmisunderstood.\r\n\r\n\"Arm hurting? I'll have that needle out of your vein in a few minutes\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\nWhen she had freed his arm and put away the apparatus, she came to his\r\nside. \"Bart, how did it happen? How did they find you out?\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly, the longing for human contact was too much for Bart, and the\r\nknowledge of his secret intolerable. The Lhari could find out what he\r\nknew, if they wanted to know, very simply; he was in their power. It\r\ndidn't matter any more.\r\n\r\nThe telling of the story took a long time, and when he finished, Meta's\r\nsoft small kitten-face was compassionate.\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad you--decided what you did,\" she whispered. \"It's what a\r\nMentorian would have done. I know that other races call us _slaves of\r\nthe Lhari_. We aren't. We're working in our own way to show the Lhari\r\nthat human beings can be trusted. The other peoples--they hold away from\r\nthe Lhari, fighting them with words even though they're afraid to fight\r\nthem with weapons, carrying on the war that they're afraid to fight!\r\n\r\n\"Did it ever occur to you--all the peoples of all the planets keep\r\nsaying, _We're as good as the Lhari_, but only the Mentorians are\r\nwilling to prove it? Bart, a Lhari ship can't get along in our galaxy\r\nwithout Mentorians any more! It may be slower than trying to take the\r\nwarp-drive by force, or stealing it by spying, but when we learn to\r\nendure it, I have faith that we'll get it!\"\r\n\r\nBart, although moved by Meta's philosophy, couldn't quite share it. It\r\nstill seemed to him that the Mentorians were lacking in\r\nsomething--independence, maybe, or drive.\r\n\r\n\"I wasn't thinking about anything like that,\" he said honestly. \"It was\r\nsimply that I couldn't let them die. After all--\" he was speaking more\r\nto himself than to the girl--\"it's _their_ star-drive. _They_ found it.\r\nAnd they've given us star-trade, and star-travel, cheaply and with\r\nprofit to both sides. I hope we'll get the star-drive someday. But if we\r\ngot it by mass murder, it would sow the seeds of a hatred between men\r\nand Lhari that would never end. It wouldn't be worth it, Meta. Nothing\r\nwould be worth that. We've got enough hate already.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBart was still in his bunk, but beginning to fret at staying there, when\r\nthe familiar trembling of Acceleration Two started to run through the\r\nship. It was, by now, so familiar to him that he hardly gave it a second\r\nthought, but Meta panicked.\r\n\r\n\"What's happening? Bart, what is it? Why are we under acceleration\r\nagain?\"\r\n\r\n\"Shift to warp,\" he said without thinking, and her face went deathly\r\nwhite. \"So that's it,\" she whispered. \"Vorongil--no wonder he wasn't\r\nworried about what I would find out from you or what you knew.\" She drew\r\nherself together in her chair, a miserable, shrunken, terrified little\r\nfigure, bravely trying to control her terror.\r\n\r\nThen she held out her hands to Bart. \"I'm--I'm ashamed,\" she whispered.\r\n\"When you've been so brave, I shouldn't be afraid to die.\"\r\n\r\n\"Meta, what's the matter? What are you afraid of?\" It suddenly swept\r\nover Bart what she meant and what she feared. \"But don't you understand,\r\nMeta?\" he exclaimed, \"Humans _can_ live through the warp-drive! No\r\ndrugs, no cold-sleep--Meta, I've done it dozens of times!\"\r\n\r\n_\"But you're a Lhari!\"_ It burst from her, uncontrollable. She stopped,\r\nlooked at him in consternation. He smiled, bitterly.\r\n\r\n\"No, Meta, they didn't do a thing to my internal organs, to my brain, to\r\nthe tissues of my body. Just a little plastic surgery on my hands, my\r\nfeet and my face. Meta, there's nothing to be afraid of--nothing,\" he\r\nrepeated.\r\n\r\nShe twisted her small hands together. \"I'm--trying to--to believe that,\"\r\nshe whispered, \"but all my life I've known--\"\r\n\r\nThe screaming whine in the ship gripped them with the strange, clawing\r\nlassitude and discomfort. Bart, gasping under it, heard the girl moan,\r\nsaw her slump lax in her chair, half fainting. Her face was so deathly\r\nwhite that he began seriously to be afraid she would die of her fear.\r\nFighting his own agonizing weakness, he pulled himself upright. He\r\nreached the girl, dug his claws cruelly into her.\r\n\r\n\"Girl, get hold of yourself! Fight it! _Fight_ it! The more scared you\r\nare, the worse it's going to be!\"\r\n\r\nShe was rigid, trembling, in a trance of terror.\r\n\r\n\"You rotten little coward,\" he yelled at her, \"snap out of it! Or are\r\nall you Mentorians so gutless that you believe any half-baked folk tale\r\nthe Lhari pass off on you? You and your fine talk about earning the\r\nstar-drive! What would you do with it after you got it--if you die of\r\nfear when you try?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! You--!\" She flung her head back, her eyes blazing with rage.\r\n\"Anything you can do, I can do, too!\" He saw life flowing back into her\r\nface, and the trembling now was with fury, not fear; she was fighting\r\nthe pain, the crawling itch in her nerve ends, the terrible sense of\r\ndraining disorganization.\r\n\r\nBart felt his hold on himself breaking. He whispered hoarsely, \"That's\r\nthe girl--don't be scared if I--black out for a minute.\" He held on to\r\nconsciousness with his last courage, afraid if he fainted, the girl\r\nwould collapse again.\r\n\r\nShe reached for him, and Bart, starved for some human touch, drew her\r\ninto his arms. They clung together, and he felt her wet face against his\r\nown, the softness of her trembling hands. She was still crying a little.\r\nThen the blackness closed on him, as if endless, and the gray blur of\r\nwarp-drive peak blotted his brain into nothingness.\r\n\r\nHe came out of it to feel her cheek soft against his, her head\r\ntrustfully on his shoulder. He said huskily, \"All right, Meta?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm fine,\" she murmured, shakily. He tightened his hands a little,\r\nrealizing that for the first time in months he had physically forgotten\r\nhis Lhari disguise, that Meta had given him this priceless reassurance\r\nthat he was human. But, as if suddenly aware of it again, she looked up\r\nat him and drew hesitantly away.\r\n\r\n\"Don't--Meta, am I so horrible to you then? So--repulsive?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it's only--\" she bit her lip--\"it's just that the Lhari are--I\r\ncan't quite explain it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Different,\" Bart finished for her. \"At first I was repelled--physically\r\nrepelled by myself, and by them. It was like living among weird animals,\r\nand being one of the animals. And then, one day, Ringg was just another\r\nkid. He had gray skin and long claws and white hair, just the way I once\r\nhad pinkish skin and short fingernails and reddish hair, but the\r\ndifference wasn't that I was human inside and he wasn't. If you skinned\r\nRingg, and skinned me, we'd be almost identical. And all of a sudden\r\nthen, Ringg and Vorongil and all the rest were men to me. Just people. I\r\nthought you Mentorians, after living with the Lhari all these years,\r\nwould feel that.\"\r\n\r\nShe said in slow wonder, \"We've lived and worked side by side with them\r\nall these years, yet kept so apart! I've defended the Lhari to you, yet\r\nit took you to explain them to me!\"\r\n\r\nHis arm was still round her, her head still lying on his shoulder. Bart\r\nwas just beginning to wonder if he might kiss her when the infirmary\r\ndoor opened and Ringg stood in the doorway, staring at them with\r\nsurprise, shock and revulsion. Bart realized, suddenly, how it must look\r\nto Ringg--who certainly shared Meta's prejudice--but even as he\r\ncomprehended it, Ringg's face altered. Meta slipped from Bart's arms and\r\nrose, but Ringg came slowly a step into the room.\r\n\r\n\"I--remembered you had a bad reaction, to warp-drive,\" he said. \"I came\r\nto see if you were all right. I would never have believed--but I'm\r\nbeginning to guess. There was always something about you, Bartol.\" He\r\nshut the door behind him and stood against it. His voice lowered almost\r\nto a whisper, he said, \"You're not Lhari, are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Vorongil knows,\" Bart said.\r\n\r\nRingg nodded. \"That day on Lharillis. The crew was talking, but only one\r\nor two of them really _know_ what happened. There are a dozen rumors. I\r\nwanted to see you. They said you were sick with radiation burns--\"\r\n\r\n\"I was.\"\r\n\r\nRingg raised his hand, absently, to the still-puckered mark on his\r\ncheek, saw Bart watching him and smiled.\r\n\r\n\"You're not worrying about that fight? Forget it, friend. If anything, I\r\nadmire someone who can use his claws--especially if, as I begin to\r\nsuspect, they're not his.\" He leaned over, his hand lightly on Bart's\r\nshoulder. \"I don't forget so easily. You saved my life, remember? And\r\nyou're a hero on the ship for warning us all. Are you really human? Why\r\nnot get rid of the disguise?\"\r\n\r\nBart laughed wryly. \"It won't come off,\" he said, and explained.\r\n\r\nRingg raised his hands to his own face curiously. \"I wonder what sort of\r\nhuman I'd make?\" He looked at Meta's small fingers. \"Not that I'd ever\r\nhave the nerve. But then, it's no surprise to anyone that you have\r\ncourage, Bartol.\"\r\n\r\n\"You seem to accept it--\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a shock,\" said Ringg honestly, \"it scares me a little. But I'm\r\nremembering the friendship. That was real. As far as I'm concerned, it\r\nstill is real.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN\r\n\r\n\r\nRingg was still bending over Meta's hand when Vorongil came into the\r\ncabin. He started to speak, then noticed Ringg. \"I might have known,\" he\r\ngrowled, \"if there was anything to find out, you'd find it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall I go, _rieko mori_?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, stay. You'll find it out some way or other, you might as well get\r\nit right the first time. But first of all--are you all right, Meta?\"\r\n\r\nHer chin went up, defiantly. \"Yes. And why have you lied to us all these\r\nyears--all of you?\"\r\n\r\nVorongil looked mildly startled. \"It wasn't exactly a lie. Nine out of\r\nten Lhari captains believe it with all their heart--that humans die in\r\nwarp-drive. I wasn't sure myself until I heard the debates in Council\r\nCity, last year.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why?\"\r\n\r\nVorongil sighed. His eyes rested disconcertingly on Bart. \"I presume you\r\nknow human history,\" he said, \"better than I do. The Lhari have never\r\nhad a war, in all written history. Quite frankly, you terrified us. It\r\nwas decided, on the highest summit levels, that we wouldn't give humans\r\ntoo many chances to find out things we preferred to keep to ourselves.\r\nThe first few ships to carry Mentorians had carried them without\r\ncold-sleep, but people forget easily. The truth is buried in the records\r\nof those early voyages.\r\n\r\n\"As the Mentorians grew more important to us, we began to regret the\r\npolicy, but by that time the Mentorians themselves believed it so firmly\r\nthat when we tried the experiment of carrying them through the shift\r\ninto warp-drive, they died of fear--pure suggestion. I tried it with\r\nyou, Meta, because I knew Bart's presence would reassure you. The others\r\nwere given an inert sedative they believed to be the cold-sleep drug.\r\nHow are you feeling, Bart?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fine--but wondering what's going to happen.\"\r\n\r\n\"You won't be hurt,\" Vorongil said, quickly. Then: \"You don't believe\r\nme, do you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't, sir. David Briscoe did what I did, and he's dead. So are three\r\nother men.\"\r\n\r\n\"Men do strange things from fear--men and Lhari. Your people, as I said\r\nbefore, have a strange history. It scares us. Can you guarantee that\r\nsome, at least, of your people wouldn't try to come and take the\r\nstar-drive by force? We left a man on Lharillis who thought nothing of\r\nkilling twenty-four of us. I suppose the captain of the _Multiphase_,\r\nknowing he had gravely violated Lhari laws, knowing that Briscoe's\r\nreport might touch off an intergalactic war between men and Lhari--well,\r\nI suppose he felt that half a dozen deaths were better than half a\r\nmillion. I'm not defending him. Just explaining, maybe, why he did what\r\nhe did.\"\r\n\r\nBart lowered his eyes. He had no answer to that.\r\n\r\n\"No, you won't be killed. But that's all I can guarantee. My personal\r\nfeelings have nothing to do with it. You'll have to go to Council Planet\r\nwith us, and you'll have to be psych-checked there. That is Lhari\r\nlaw--and by treaty with your Federation, it is human law, too. If you\r\nknow anything dangerous to us, we have a legal right to eliminate those\r\nmemories before you can be released.\"\r\n\r\nMeta smiled at him, encouragingly, but Bart shivered. That was almost\r\nworse than the thought of death.\r\n\r\nAnd the fear grew more oppressive as the ship forged onward toward the\r\nhome world of the Lhari. And it did not lessen when, after they touched\r\ndown, he was taken from the ship under guard.\r\n\r\nHe had only a glimpse, through dark glasses, of the terrible brilliance\r\nof the Lhari sun dazzling on crystal towers, before he was hustled into\r\na closed surface car. It whisked him away to a building he did not see\r\nfrom the outside; he was taken up by private elevator to a suite of\r\nrooms which might--for all he could tell--have been a suite in a luxury\r\nhotel or a lunatic asylum. The walls were translucent, the furniture\r\noddly colored, and so carefully padded that even a homicidal or suicidal\r\nperson could not have hurt himself or anyone else on it or with it.\r\n\r\nFood reached him often enough so that he never got hungry, but not often\r\nenough to keep him from being bored between meals, or from brooding. Two\r\nenormous Lhari came in to look at him every hour or so, but either they\r\nwere deaf and dumb, did not understand his dialect of Lhari, or were\r\nunder orders not to speak to him. It was the most frustrating time of\r\nhis entire voyage.\r\n\r\nOne day it ended. A Lhari and a Mentorian came for him and took him down\r\nelevators and up stairs, and into a quiet, neutral room where four Lhari\r\nwere gathered. They sat him in a comfortable chair, and the Mentorian\r\ninterpreter said gently, with apology:\r\n\r\n\"Bart Steele, I have been asked to say to you that you will not be\r\nphysically harmed in any way. This will be much simpler, and will have\r\nmuch less injurious effect on your mind if you cooperate with us. At the\r\nsame time, I have been asked to remind you that resistance is absolutely\r\nuseless, and if you attempt it, you will only be treated with force\r\nrather than with courtesy.\"\r\n\r\nBart sat facing them, shaking with humiliation. The thought of\r\nresistance flashed through his mind. Maybe he should make them fight for\r\nwhat they got! At least they'd see that all humans weren't like the\r\nMentorians, to sit quietly and let themselves be brainwashed without a\r\nword of protest.\r\n\r\nHe started to spring up, and the hands of his guards tightened, swift\r\nand strong, even before his muscles had fully tightened. Bart's head\r\ndropped. Cold common sense doused over his brave thoughts. He was\r\nuncountable millions of light-years from his own people. He was\r\nabsolutely alone. Bravery would mean nothing; submission would mean\r\nnothing. Would he be more of a man, somehow, if he let his mind be\r\nwrecked?\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" he muttered, \"I won't fight.\"\r\n\r\n\"You show your good sense,\" the Mentorian said quietly. \"Give me your\r\nleft arm, please--or, if you are left-handed, your right. As you\r\nprefer.\"\r\n\r\nDeftly, almost painlessly, a needle slid into his arm. _Giving in._ A\r\ndizzying welter of thoughts spun suddenly in his mind. Briscoe. Raynor\r\nOne and Raynor Three. The net between the stars. Ringg, Vorongil, Meta,\r\nhis father....\r\n\r\nConsciousness slid away.\r\n\r\nYears later--he never knew whether it was memory or imagination--it\r\nseemed to him that he could reach into that patch of gray and dreamless\r\ntime and fish out questions and answers whole, the faces of Lhari\r\nswelling up suddenly in his eyes and shrinking back into interstellar\r\ndistance, the sting-smell of drugs, the sound of unexpected voices, odd\r\nreflex pains, cobwebs of patchy memories that fitted nowhere else into\r\nhis life so that he supposed they must go here.\r\n\r\nHe only knew that there was a time he did not remember and then a time\r\nwhen he began to think there was such a thing as memory, and then a time\r\nwhen he floated without a body, and then another time when the path of\r\nevery separate nerve in his body seemed to be outlined, a shimmering web\r\nin the gray murk. There was a mirror and a face. There were blotchy\r\nworms of light like the star-trails of peaking warp-drive through the\r\nviewport, colors shifting and receding, a green star, the red eye of\r\nAntares.\r\n\r\nThen the peak-point faded, his mind began to decelerate and angle slowly\r\ndown and down into the field of awareness, and he became fuzzily aware\r\nthat he was lying full length on a sort of couch. He shook his head\r\ngroggily. It hurt. He sat up. That hurt, too. A hand closed gently\r\naround his elbow and he felt the cold edge of a cup against his sore\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\n\"Take a sip of this.\"\r\n\r\nThe liquid felt cool on his tongue, evaporating almost before he could\r\nswallow; the fumes seemed to mount inside the root of his nose,\r\nexpanding tremendously inside his head and brain. Abruptly his head was\r\nclear, the last traces of gray fuzz gone.\r\n\r\n\"When you feel able,\" the Mentorian said courteously, \"the High Council\r\nwill see you.\"\r\n\r\nBart blinked. As if exploring a sore tooth with his tongue, his mind\r\nsought for memories, but they all seemed clear, marshaled in line. The\r\ndetails, clear and unblurred, of his voyage here. His humiliation and\r\nresentment against the Lhari. _They could have changed my thinking, my\r\nattitudes. They could have made me admire or be loyal to the Lhari. They\r\ndidn't. I'm still me._\r\n\r\n\"I'm ready now.\" He got up, reeled and had to lean on the Mentorian; his\r\nfeet did not seem to touch the ground in quite the right way. After a\r\nminute he could walk steadily, and followed the Mentorian along a\r\ncorridor. The Mentorian said into a small grille, \"The Vegan Bartol,\r\nalias Bart Steele,\" and after a moment a doorway opened.\r\n\r\nInside a room rose, high, domed, vaulted above his head, whitish\r\nopalescent, washed with green. For a moment, while his eyes adjusted to\r\nthe light, he wondered how the Lhari saw it.\r\n\r\nBeyond an expanse of black, glassy floor, he saw a low semicircular\r\ntable, behind which sat eight Lhari. All wore pale robes with high\r\ncollars that rose stiffly behind their domed heads; all were old, their\r\nfaces lined with many wrinkles, and seven of the eight were as bald as\r\nthe hull of the _Swiftwing_. Under their eyes he hesitated; then,\r\nunexpectedly, pride stiffened his back.\r\n\r\nThey should have done a better job of brainwashing, if they expected him\r\nto skulk in like a scared rabbit! He held his head high and moved across\r\nthe floor step by steady step, trying not to limp or display that he\r\nfelt tired or sore.\r\n\r\n_You're human! Act proud of it!_\r\n\r\nNo one moved until he stood before the semicircle of ancients. Then the\r\nyoungest, the only one of the eight with some trace of feathery crest on\r\nhis high gray head, said \"Captain Vorongil, you identify this person?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do,\" Vorongil said, and Bart saw him seated before the high Council.\r\nTo Bart, the Lhari captain seemed a familiar, almost a friendly face.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Bart Steele, alias Bartol son of Berihun,\" said one old Lhari,\r\n\"what have you to say for yourself?\"\r\n\r\nBart stood silent, not moving. What could he say that would not reveal\r\nhow desperately alone, how young and foolish and frightened he felt? All\r\nhis brave resolutions seemed to drain away before their old, gnomish\r\nfaces. Here he'd been thinking of himself as a brave spy, a gallant\r\nfighter in humanity's cause and what not. Now he saw himself for what he\r\nwas; a reckless boy, meddling in affairs too big for him. He lowered his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\"We have read the transcript of your knowledge,\" said the old Lhari.\r\n\"There is little in it that we do not know. We are not, of course,\r\nconcerned with human conspiracies unless they endanger Lhari lives. The\r\nAntares authorities will deal with the man Montano for an unauthorized\r\nlanding on Lharillis, in violation of Federation treaty.\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled, his gnome's face breaking into a million tiny cracks like a\r\npiece of gray-glazed pottery. \"Bartol, or whatever you call yourself,\r\nyou are a brave young man. I suppose you are afraid we will block your\r\nmemories, or your ability to speak of them?\"\r\n\r\nBart nodded, gulping. Did the old Lhari read his mind?\r\n\r\n\"A year ago we might have done so. Captain Vorongil, you will be\r\ninterested to know that we have discussed this in Council, and your\r\nrecommendations have been taken. The secret that humans can endure\r\nstar-drive has outlived its usefulness. For good or ill, it is secret no\r\nlonger. We cannot possibly eliminate all the old records, or the\r\nenterprising people who hunt them out.\r\n\r\n\"The captain who had David Briscoe killed, under the mistaken notion\r\nthat this would excuse his own negligence in letting Briscoe stow away\r\non his ship, is undergoing psychotherapy and may eventually recover.\r\n\r\n\"As for the rest--Bart Steele, you know nothing that is a danger to us.\r\nYou do not know the coordinates of our world, or even in which galaxy it\r\nis located. You do not know where we secure the catalyst your people\r\nseek. In fact, you know nothing that is not soon to become common\r\nknowledge. In view of that, we have decided not to interfere with your\r\nmemories.\"\r\n\r\n\"Talk as much as you like,\" added another of the ancients, \"and may your\r\nmemories of this voyage help in understanding between the Lhari and\r\nother human races. Good fortune to you.\" And he was smiling.\r\n\r\n\"There is another side to this,\" said a third, more sternly and gravely.\r\n\"You have broken a treaty between Lhari and man. We have dealt with you\r\nas the laws required; now your own people must do so. You must return\r\nwith the _Swiftwing_ to the planet where the violation originated--\" he\r\nconsulted a memorandum--\"Procyon Alpha. There you and the man Raynor\r\nThree will face charges of unlawful conspiracy to board a Lhari ship, in\r\nviolation of Intergalactic Trade treaties. Captain Vorongil, will you be\r\nresponsible for him?\"\r\n\r\n_So I've lost_, Bart thought drearily. _I didn't even learn anything\r\nimportant enough for them to suppress._ There was a strange wounded\r\npride in this; after all his trouble, he was being treated like a little\r\nboy who has used a great deal of enterprise and intelligence to rob a\r\ncookie cupboard, and for his pains is sent home with the stolen cookie\r\nin his hand.\r\n\r\nVorongil touched his arm. \"Come, Bartol,\" he said gently, \"I'm taking\r\nyou back to the _Swiftwing_. I don't have to treat you like a prisoner,\r\ndo I?\"\r\n\r\nNumbly, Bart gave what the old Lhari asked, his word of honor not to\r\nattempt escape (_Escape? Where to?_) or to attempt to enter the drive\r\nchamber of the _Swiftwing_ while they were still among the Lhari worlds.\r\n\r\nAs they left the council hall, Bart, in a gesture of despair, covered\r\nhis face with his hands. As he brought them down, he found himself\r\nstaring at them, transfixed.\r\n\r\nThe fingers looked longer and thinner than he remembered them, but they\r\nwere his own hands again. The nails seemed faintly thick and ridged, and\r\nthere was still a faint grayish tinge through the pale flesh color, but\r\nthey were human hands. Unmistakably. He felt of his nose and ears, with\r\nfumbling fingers; raised his hand and touched the very short, crisp hair\r\ngrowing on his newly shaven skull.\r\n\r\n\"You fool,\" said Vorongil to the Mentorian, in disgust, \"why didn't you\r\ntell him what the medics had done for him? Easy, Bartol!\" The old\r\nLhari's arm tightened around his shoulder. \"I thought they'd told you.\r\nSomebody come here and give the youngster a hand.\"\r\n\r\nLater, in the small cabin (it had been Rugel's) which was to be his\r\nprison during the return voyage of the _Swiftwing_, he had a chance to\r\nstudy his familiar-strange face. He had thought that only a short\r\ntime--an hour or so--had elapsed between the time he was drugged and the\r\ntime they took him before the Council. Later, from what he learned about\r\nthe dispatch schedules of the _Swiftwing_, he realized that he had been\r\nkept under sedation for nearly three weeks, while his face and hands\r\nhealed.\r\n\r\nAs Raynor Three had warned, the change was not altogether reversible.\r\nStudying his face in the mirror, he could still see a hint of something\r\nthin, strange, alien in the set of his features; the nose and chin\r\nsomewhat too pointed, elfin, to be human. His hands would always be too\r\nlong, too narrow, too supple. For the rest, he looked grim, older. He\r\ncould never go back to what he had been before he became a Lhari; it had\r\nleft its mark on him forever.\r\n\r\nBefore the _Swiftwing_ lifted, outbound, Vorongil came to his cabin.\r\n\"You've seen very little of our world,\" he said diffidently. \"I have\r\npermission for you to visit the city before we leave Council Spaceport.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think you can trust me?\" Bart asked bitterly.\r\n\r\nVorongil said gravely, without humor, \"The question does not arise. You\r\ndo not know the coordinates of this world, and have no way of finding\r\nthem. Within those limitations, you are an honored guest here, and if it\r\nwould give you any pleasure, you are welcome to see as much of Council\r\nPlanet as time permits.\"\r\n\r\nIt seemed, through Vorongil's kindness, that the old Lhari sensed his\r\nbitter defeat. Nothing was to be gained by sulking in his cabin, a\r\nprisoner. He had an opportunity which no human, except the Mentorians,\r\nhad ever had; which perhaps no human would ever have again. He might as\r\nwell take advantage of it.\r\n\r\nRingg and Meta both seemed startled at his new appearance, but Meta\r\ninstantly held out her hands, clasping his quickly and warmly. \"Bart! I\r\nwondered what your real face looked like. But I think I'd have known you\r\nanyhow.\"\r\n\r\nRingg surveyed him wonderingly, shaking his head. \"Say something,\" he\r\nimplored, \"so I'll know you're Bartol.\"\r\n\r\nBart held out his arm, less gray by the day as the drug wore out of his\r\nsystem. The thin line of the scar was still on it. He raised his\r\nforefinger lightly to the fine line on Ringg's cheek. \"I couldn't return\r\nthat now. So let's not get into any more fights.\"\r\n\r\nRingg laughed and gave him a rough, affectionate shove. \"You're Bartol,\r\nall right!\"\r\n\r\nEven his sense of defeat vanished in wonder as they came out into the\r\ngreat spaceport. He saw, now, that the Lhari spaceports in human worlds\r\nwere built to create, for the spacemen so far from their native worlds,\r\nsome feeling of home. But everything here was so vast as to stagger the\r\nimagination. There were miles and miles of the great ships, lying strewn\r\nlike pebbles on this monster beachhead into space, bearing the\r\nstrangeness of a million far-flung stars. He gaped like a child.\r\n\r\nAbove them, the burning brilliance of a star gave strange glow and color\r\nto the crystal pylons. What color was the star? He turned to Meta,\r\nirritated at his inability to be sure.\r\n\r\n\"Meta, what color is this sun? I've been all around the spectrum, and\r\nit's not red, blue, green, orange, violet--\" He broke off, realizing\r\nwhat he had said and what he had seen. \"An eighth color,\" he finished,\r\nanticlimatically.\r\n\r\n\"You and your talk of colors,\" Ringg grumbled, \"I wish I knew what you\r\nMentorians see! It's like trying to imagine seeing a smell or hearing\r\nlight!\"\r\n\r\nMeta laughed. \"As far as I know, no one's named it. Sometimes we\r\nMentorians call it _catalyst color_. I think only Mentorians can see it\r\nas separate color.\"\r\n\r\n\"So what?\" Ringg said impatiently, \"What are we going to do, chatter\r\nabout light waves or see the city?\"\r\n\r\nBart acquiesced, trying to sound eager, but a wild excitement was\r\ngusting up in him. He dutifully pretended fascination with the towers,\r\nthe many-leveled roads, the giant dams and pylons, but his thoughts were\r\nracing.\r\n\r\n_The eighth color!_ There can't be too many suns of this color, or\r\nthey'd have named it and known it! And telescopes can find it.\r\n\r\nCould success be salvaged, then, at the very edge of failure? Maybe he\r\nneed not go empty-handed, empty-eyed, from the Lhari worlds! They had\r\ndismissed him, scornfully, stolen cookie in hand--but maybe it would be\r\na bigger cookie than they dreamed!\r\n\r\nThe exhilaration lasted through the tour of the port, through the heavy\r\nsurge of acceleration which brought them up, out and way from Council\r\nPlanet. Bart, confined in Rugel's cabin, hardly felt like a prisoner,\r\nhis mind busy with schemes.\r\n\r\n_I'll study star-maps, and spectroscope reports...._\r\n\r\nIt lasted almost two days of shiptime, and they were readying for\r\nAcceleration Two, before he came, figuratively, down to earth. To pick\r\none star out of trillions--and not even in his own galaxy? It would take\r\na lifetime and he didn't even know which of the four or five spiral\r\nnebulae in the skies of the human worlds was the Lhari Galaxy. A\r\nlifetime? A hundred lifetimes wouldn't do it!\r\n\r\nHe might have known. If there had been one chance in the odd billion of\r\nhis making any such discovery, the Lhari would never have given Vorongil\r\npermission for the intruder to visit the planet at all. He would have\r\nbeen returned to the _Swiftwing_ as he had been taken from it, by closed\r\ncar, and imprisoned, maybe even drugged, until he was safely back in the\r\nhuman worlds again.\r\n\r\nHe was under parole not to enter the drive chamber (and sure he would be\r\nstopped if he attempted it anyhow), but when Acceleration One was\r\ncompleted, he went to the viewport in the Recreation Lounge, and nobody\r\nthrew him out. He stood long, looking at the unfamiliar galaxy of the\r\nLhari stars; the unknown, forever unknowable constellations with their\r\nstrange shapes. Stars green, gold, topaz, burning blue, sullen red, and\r\nthe great strangely colored receding sun of the Lhari people, known to\r\nthem by the melodious name of the Ke Lhiro--which meant, simply, _The\r\nSun_: it was their first home.\r\n\r\nWhere had he seen that color? In that stolen glimpse of the Lhari ship\r\nlanding, long ago? Of all the colors of space, this one he would never\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nHe turned away from the unsolvable riddle of the strange constellations;\r\nand went to his cabin, to dream of the green star Meristem where he had\r\nfirst plotted known coordinates for a previously unknown world, and to\r\nwander in baffling nightmares where he fed jagged, star-colored pieces\r\nof hail into the ship's computer and watched them come out as tiny\r\npaperdoll spaceships with the letterhead of Eight Colors printed neatly\r\nacross their sides.\r\n\r\nAfter the warp-drive shift, Vorongil came to his cabin, this time crisp\r\nand businesslike.\r\n\r\n\"We're back in your galaxy,\" he said, \"among the stars you know. We have\r\nno passenger space on the _Swiftwing_; we had to ship out without\r\nreplacing Rugel, which means we're short two men. I've no authority to\r\nask this of you, but--would you like your old job back for the rest of\r\nthe voyage?\"\r\n\r\nBart glanced at his human hands.\r\n\r\nVorongil shrugged. \"We've carried Mentorians as full-ranking\r\nAstrogators. There don't happen to be any on the _Swiftwing_. But\r\nthere's no law about it.\"\r\n\r\nBart looked the old Lhari in the eye. \"I won't accept Mentorian terms,\r\nVorongil.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't ask it. You worked your way outward on this run, and the\r\nHigh Council didn't see fit to erase those memories or inhibit them. Why\r\nshould I? Do you want it or not?\"\r\n\r\nDid he want it? Until this moment Bart had not identified the worst of\r\nhis pain and defeat--to travel as a passenger, a supercargo, when he had\r\nonce been part of the _Swiftwing_. Literally he ached to be back with it\r\nagain. \"I do, _rieko mori_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" Vorongil rapped, \"see that you turn out next watch!\" He\r\nspun round and walked out. His tone was no longer gently indulgent, but\r\nsharp and distant. Bart, at first surprised, suddenly understood.\r\n\r\nNot now a prisoner, a passenger, a guest on the _Swiftwing_. He was part\r\nof the crew again--and Vorongil was his captain.\r\n\r\nThe Lhari crew were oddly constrained at first. But Ringg was the same\r\nas always, and before long they were almost on the old terms. With every\r\nwatch, it seemed, he was building a bridge between man and Lhari. They\r\naccepted him.\r\n\r\nBut for what? Something might come, in the far future, of his\r\nacceptance, but he wouldn't get the benefit of it. This would be his\r\nonly voyage; after this he'd be chained again, crawling from planet to\r\nplanet of a single sun. And as warp-shift followed warp-shift, the\r\n_Swiftwing_ retracing the path of her outward cruise star by star, Bart\r\nsaid farewell to them.\r\n\r\nOne day, at last, he stood at the viewport, watching Procyon Alpha\r\nnearing. A year ago, frightened, terribly alone, still unsteady on his\r\nnew Lhari muscles and terrified by the monsters that were his shipmates,\r\nhe had watched these planets spinning away. Poor old Rugel, poor old\r\nBaldy!\r\n\r\nBehind him, Meta came into the lounge.\r\n\r\n\"Bart--\"\r\n\r\nHe turned to face her. \"It won't be much longer, Meta. Tomorrow I'll\r\nfind out what the Federation is going to do to me. _Conspiracy\r\nunlawfully to board_--and all the rest of it. Even if I don't go to a\r\nprison planet, I'll spend the rest of my life chained down to Vega.\"\r\n\r\n\"It doesn't have to be that way.\"\r\n\r\n\"What other choice is there?\" he demanded.\r\n\r\n\"You're half Mentorian,\" she said, raising her eager face. \"Oh, Bart,\r\nyou love it so, you know you can't bear to give it up. Stay with\r\nus--please stay!\"\r\n\r\nBefore answering, he looked out the viewport a last time. The clouds of\r\ncosmic dust swirled and foamed around the familiar jewels of his own\r\nsky. Blue, beloved Vega, burning in the heart of the Lyre--_home--when\r\nwould he go home? He had no home now._ Yet his father had left him Vega\r\nInterplanet, as well as Eight Colors and a quest to the stars.\r\n\r\nHe searched for the topaz of Sol, where he had learned astrogation;\r\nProcyon, where he had become a Lhari; the ruby of Aldebaran (_hail and\r\nfarewell, David Briscoe!_); the bloodstone of Antares, where he had\r\nlearned fear and the shape of integrity. The colors, the unknowable\r\ncolors of space. And others. Nameless stars where he and his Lhari\r\nshipmates had worked and played. And stars he had never seen and would\r\nnever see, all the endless worlds beyond worlds and stars beyond\r\nstars....\r\n\r\nHe took a last, longing look at the colors of space, then turned his\r\nback on them, deliberately giving them up. He could not pay the price\r\nthe Mentorians paid.\r\n\r\n\"No, Meta,\" he said huskily. \"The Mentorian way is one way, but--I've\r\nhad a taste of being one of the masters of space. It's more than most\r\nmen ever have, maybe it's more than I deserve. But I can't settle for\r\nanything less. Not even if it means losing you.\"\r\n\r\nHe shut his eyes and stood, head bowed. When he looked up again, he was\r\nalone with the stars beyond the viewport, and the lounge was empty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe low rainbow building of Eight Colors, near the spaceport of Procyon\r\nAlpha, had not changed; and when Bart went in, as he had done a year\r\nago, it seemed that the same varnished girl was sitting before the same\r\nglass desk, neon-edged and brittle, with the same chrome-tinged hair and\r\nblue fingernails. She looked at Bart in his Lhari clothing, at Meta in\r\nher Mentorian robe and cloak, at Ringg, and her unruffled dignity did\r\nnot turn a hair.\r\n\r\n\"May I help you?\" she inquired, still not caring.\r\n\r\n\"I want to see Raynor One.\"\r\n\r\n\"On what business, please?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell him,\" said Bart, with immense satisfaction, \"that his boss is\r\nhere--Bart Steele--and wants to see him right away.\"\r\n\r\nIt had a sort of disrupting effect. She seemed to go blurred at the\r\nedges. After a minute, blinking carefully, she spoke into the\r\nvision-screen, and reported, numbly, \"Go on up, Mr. Steele.\"\r\n\r\nHe wasn't expecting a welcome. He said so as the elevator rose. \"After\r\nall, if I'd never come back, he'd doubtless have inherited the whole\r\nEight Colors line, unencumbered. I don't expect he'll be happy to see\r\nme. But he's the only one I can turn to.\"\r\n\r\nThe elevator stopped, opened. They stepped out, and a man stepped\r\nnervously toward them. For a moment, expecting Raynor One, Bart was\r\ndeceived; then as the man's face spread in a smile of welcome, he\r\nstopped in incredulous delight.\r\n\r\n\"Raynor Three!\"\r\n\r\nIn overflowing gladness, Bart hugged him. It was like a meeting with the\r\ndead. He felt as if he had really come home. \"But--but you remember me!\"\r\nhe exclaimed, backing away, in amazement.\r\n\r\nSlowly, the man nodded. His eyes were grave. \"Yes. I decided it wasn't\r\nworth it, Bart, to go on losing everything that meant anything to me.\r\nEven if it meant I had to give up the stars, never travel again except\r\nas a passenger, I couldn't go on being afraid to remember, never knowing\r\nthe consequences or responsibilities of what I'd done.\" His sad smile\r\nwas strangely beautiful. \"The _Multiphase_ sailed without me. I've been\r\nhere, hoping against hope that someday I'd know the rest.\"\r\n\r\nAssociations clicked into place in Bart's mind. The _Multiphase_. So\r\nRaynor Three was the Mentorian who had smuggled David Briscoe off the\r\nship, and whose memories, wrung out by the Lhari captain of that ship,\r\nhad touched off so many deaths. But he had paid for that--paid many\r\ntimes over. And now must he pay for this, too?\r\n\r\nRaynor One strode toward them. \"So it's really you. I thought it might\r\nbe a trap, but Three wouldn't listen. Word came from Antares that\r\nMontano had been arrested and his ship confiscated for illegal landing\r\non Lharillis. I thought you were probably dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"We sent a boy to do a man's job,\" Raynor Three said, \"and he came back\r\na man. But tell me--\" He looked curiously at Ringg and Meta.\r\n\r\nBart introduced them, adding, \"I came for help, really. I'm facing\r\ncharges, and I'm afraid you are, too.\"\r\n\r\nRaynor One said harshly, \"A trap, after all, Three! He trapped you, and\r\nhe's led the Lhari to you!\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" Raynor Three said, \"or he wouldn't be walking around free and\r\nunguarded and with all his memories intact. Tell me about it, Bart.\" And\r\nwhen Bart had given a quick narration of the Lhari judgment, he nodded,\r\nslowly.\r\n\r\n\"That's all we ever wanted. Don't think you failed, Bart. The horrible\r\npart was only the way they were trying to keep it secret.\"\r\n\r\nRingg interrupted, \"Do not judge the Lhari by them, Raynor Three,\" and\r\nRaynor Three said in good Lhari, \"I don't, feathertop. Raynors have been\r\nworking with Lhari since the days of Rhazon of Nedrus. But I wanted an\r\nopen, official statement of Lhari policy--not secret murders by\r\nfanatics. I had confidence in the Lhari as a people, but not in\r\nindividuals. What good did it do to know that the Lhari council in\r\nanother galaxy would have condemned the murders and manhunts, when they\r\nwere going on in this one, day after day?\r\n\r\n\"Don't you see, Bart?\" he continued, \"you didn't fail--not if we're\r\ngoing to have the publicity of a test case, publicly heard. That means\r\nthe Lhari are prepared to admit, before our whole galaxy, that humans\r\n_can_ survive warp-drive without cold-sleep. That's all David Briscoe\r\nwas trying to prove, or your father either--may they rest in peace. So,\r\nwhatever happens, we've won.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you two idealists will give me a minute for cold realities,\" Raynor\r\nOne said, \"there's this. Among other things. Bart's not yet of legal\r\nage. You may not know this, Bart, but your father appointed me your\r\nlegal guardian. When I turned you over to Three, I'm afraid, I assumed\r\nlegal responsibility for all the consequences. I ought to have kept you\r\nunder my own supervision.\"\r\n\r\nBart smiled at Raynor One's stern face. \"I crossed two galaxies, and\r\nfaced the Lhari High Council, without you to hold my hand. I can face\r\nthe Trade Federation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Naturally I will be responsible for your defense,\" Raynor One said\r\nstiffly.\r\n\r\n\"But I don't need a defense,\" Bart said, turning to Raynor Three and\r\nmeeting his eyes. \"I'm going to tell the truth, and let it stand. Don't\r\nworry, I'll make sure they don't hold you responsible for my actions.\"\r\n\r\n\"Another thing. Some lunatic from Capella arrived here and all but\r\naccused me of having you murdered. Do you know a Tommy Kendron?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do I _know_ him!\" Bart interrupted with a joyful yell. \"Tommy's _here_?\r\nQuick--where do I get in touch with him?\"\r\n\r\nAn hour later they were all gathered at Raynor Three's country house.\r\nThe talk went on far into the night. Tommy wanted to know everything,\r\nand both Raynors wanted to know every detail of Bart's year among the\r\nLhari, while Meta and Ringg were both curious about how it had begun.\r\n\r\nBart tried to forget that the next day might bring trouble, even\r\nimprisonment. The Lhari Council had told him to talk as much as he liked\r\nabout his voyage, and this might be his only chance. When he had\r\nfinished, Tommy leaned forward and gripped Bart's hand tightly.\r\n\r\n\"You make them sound like pretty decent people,\" he said, looking at\r\nRingg. \"A year ago, if you'd told me I'd be here with a Lhari spaceman\r\nand a bunch of Mentorians, I'd never have believed it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor I, that I would be as friend under a human roof,\" Ringg replied.\r\n\"But a friend to Bart is my friend also.\" He touched the faint\r\ndiscolored scars on his brow, saying softly, \"But for Bart, I would not\r\nbe here to greet anyone, man or Lhari, as friend.\"\r\n\r\n\"So,\" said Tommy triumphantly, \"you haven't failed, even if you didn't\r\ndiscover the secret of the Eighth Color--\"\r\n\r\nBut a sudden, blinding light burst over Bart as Ringg moved his hand to\r\nthe scars. Once again he searched a cave beneath a green star, where\r\nRingg lay unconscious and bleeding, and played his Lhari light fearfully\r\nover a waterfall of colored minerals. _And there was one whose color he\r\ncould not identify--red, blue, violet, green, none of these_--the color\r\nof an unknown star in an unknown galaxy, the shimmer of a landing Lhari\r\nship, the color of an unknown element in an unknown fuel--\r\n\r\n\"The secret of the Eighth Color,\" he said, and stood up, his hands\r\nliterally shaking in excitement. \"I'm an _idiot_! No, don't ask me any\r\nquestions! I could still be wrong. But even if I go to a prison planet,\r\nthe Eighth Color isn't a secret any more!\"\r\n\r\nWhen the others had gone back to the city, he sat with Raynor Three in\r\nthe room where the latter had told him of his father's death, where he\r\nhad first seen his terrifying Lhari face. They spoke little, but Raynor\r\nThree finally asked, \"Were you serious about not wanting a defense,\r\nBart?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was. All I want is a chance to tell my own story in my own way. Where\r\neveryone will hear me.\"\r\n\r\nRaynor Three looked at him curiously. \"There's something you're not\r\ntelling, Bart. Want to tell me?\"\r\n\r\nBart hesitated, then held out his hand and clasped his kinsman's.\r\n\"Thanks--but no.\"\r\n\r\nRaynor Three saw his hesitation and chuckled. \"All right, son. Forget I\r\nasked. You've grown up.\"\r\n\r\nIt was good to sleep in a soft human-type bed again, to eat breakfast\r\nand shave and dress in ordinary human clothing again. But Bart folded\r\nhis Lhari tights and the cloak tenderly, with regret. They were the\r\nmemory of an experience no one else would ever have.\r\n\r\nRaynor Three let him take the controls as they flew back to the\r\nspaceport city; and a little before noon they entered the great crystal\r\npylon that was the headquarters of the Federation Trade Bureau on\r\nProcyon Alpha. Men and Lhari were moving in the lobby; among them Bart\r\nsaw Vorongil, Meta at his side. He smiled at her, received a wan smile\r\nin return.\r\n\r\nWould Vorongil feel that Bart had deceived him, betrayed him, when he\r\nheard Bart today?\r\n\r\nIn the hearing room, four white-crested Lhari sat across from four\r\ndignified, well-dressed men, representatives of the Federation of\r\nIntergalactic Trade. The space beyond was wholly filled with people,\r\ncrowded together, and carrying stereo cameras, intercom equipment, the\r\ncreepie-peepie of the on-the-spot space commentator.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Steele, we had hoped to make this a quiet hearing, without undue\r\npublicity. But we cannot deny the news media the privilege of covering\r\nit, unless you wish to claim the right to privacy.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed,\" Bart said clearly. \"I want them all to hear what I'm going\r\nto say.\"\r\n\r\nRaynor One came up to the bench. \"Bart, as your guardian, I advise\r\nagainst it. Some people will call this a publicity stunt. It won't do\r\nEight Colors any good to admit that men have been spying on the Lhari--\"\r\n\r\n\"I want press coverage,\" Bart repeated stubbornly, \"and as many\r\nstar-systems on the relay as possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right. But I wash my hands of it,\" Raynor One said angrily.\r\n\r\nBart told his story simply: his meeting with the elder Briscoe, his\r\nmeeting with Raynor One--carefully not implicating Raynor One in the\r\nplot--Raynor Three's work in altering his appearance to that of a Lhari,\r\nand the major events of his cruise on the _Swiftwing_. When he came to\r\nthe account of the shift into warp-drive, he saw the faces of the press\r\nreporters, and realized that for them this was the story of the year--or\r\ncentury: _humans can endure star-drive!_ But he went on, not\r\nsoft-pedaling Montano's attempted murder, his own choice, the trip to\r\nthe Lhari world--\r\n\r\nOne of the board representatives interrupted testily, \"What is the point\r\nof this lengthy narrative? You can give the story to the newsmen without\r\nour official sanction, if you want to make it a heroic epic, young\r\nSteele. We have heard sufficient to prove your guilt, and that of\r\nRaynor, in the violation of treaty--\"\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless, I want this official,\" Bart said. \"I don't want to be\r\nmobbed when they hear that I have the secret of the star-drive.\"\r\n\r\nThe effect was electric. The four Lhari sat up; their white crests\r\ntwitched. Vorongil stared, his gray eyes darkening with fear. One of the\r\nLhari leaned forward, shooting the question at him harshly.\r\n\r\n\"You did _not_ discover the coordinates of the Council Planet of Ke\r\nLhiro! You did not discover--\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not,\" Bart said quietly. \"I don't know them and I have no\r\nintention of trying to find them. We don't need to go to the Lhari\r\nGalaxy to find the mineral that generates the warp-frequencies, that\r\nthey call 'Catalyst A' and that the Mentorians call the 'Eighth Color.'\r\nThere is a green star called Meristem, and a spectroscopic analysis of\r\nthat star, I'm sure, will reveal what unknown elements it contains, and\r\nperhaps locate other stars with that element. There must be others in\r\nour galaxy, but the coordinates of the star Meristem are known to me.\"\r\n\r\nVorongil was staring at him, his mouth open. He leaped up and cried out,\r\nshaking, \"But they assured us that among your memories--there was\r\nnothing of danger to us--\"\r\n\r\nCompassionately, gently, Bart said, \"There wasn't--not that they knew\r\nabout, Vorongil. I didn't realize it myself. I might never have\r\nremembered seeing a mineral that was of a color not found in the\r\nspectrum. Certainly, a memory like that meant nothing to the Lhari\r\nmedics who emptied out my mind and turned over all my thoughts. You\r\nLhari can't see color at all.\r\n\r\n\"So no one but I saw the color of the mineral in the cave; you Lhari\r\nyourselves don't _know_ that your fuel looks unlike anything else in the\r\nuniverse. You never cared to find out how your world looked to your\r\nMentorians. So your medics never questioned my memories of an eighth\r\ncolor. To you, it's just another shade of gray, but under a light strong\r\nenough to blind any but Mentorian eyes, it takes on a special color--\"\r\n\r\nThe conference broke up in disorder, the four Lhari clustering together\r\nin a furious babble, then hastily leaving the room. Bart stood waiting,\r\nfeeling empty and cold. Vorongil's stare baffled him with unreadable\r\nemotion.\r\n\r\n\"You fool, you unspeakable young idiot!\" Raynor One groaned. \"Why did\r\nyou blurt it out like that before every news media in the galaxy? Why,\r\nwe could have had a monopoly on the star-drive--Eight Colors and Vega\r\nInterplanet!\" As he saw the men of the press approaching with their\r\nmicrophones, lights, cameras and TV equipment, he gripped Bart urgently\r\nby the arm.\r\n\r\n\"We can still salvage something! Don't talk any more! Refer them to\r\nme--say I'm your guardian and your business manager--you can still make\r\nsomething of this--\"\r\n\r\n\"That's just what I don't want to do,\" Bart replied, and broke away from\r\nhim to approach the newsmen.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, certainly, I'll answer all your questions, gentlemen.\"\r\n\r\nRaynor One flung up his hands in despair, but over their shoulder he saw\r\nthe glowing face of Meta, and smiled. She, at least, would understand.\r\nSo would Raynor Three.\r\n\r\nA page boy touched Bart on the arm. \"Mr. Steele,\" he said, \"you are to\r\nappear immediately before the World Council!\"\r\n\r\nHe was to be asked one question again and again in the days that\r\nfollowed, but his real answer was to Meta and Raynor Three, looking\r\nquietly past Raynor One and speaking to the news cameras that would\r\ncarry his words all over the galaxy to men and Lhari:\r\n\r\n\"Why didn't I keep it for myself? Because there are always men like\r\nMontano, who in their mistaken pride will murder and steal for such\r\nthings. I want this knowledge to be open to all men, to be used for\r\ntheir benefit. There has been too much secrecy already. I want all men\r\nto have the stars.\"\r\n\r\nHe had to tell his story again and again to the hastily summoned\r\nrepresentatives of the Galactic Federation. At one point the delegate\r\nfrom his home star of Vega actually rose and shouted to him, \"This is\r\ntreason! You betrayed your home world--and the whole human race! Don't\r\nyou know the Lhari may fight a war over this?\"\r\n\r\nBart remembered Vorongil's silent, sad confession of the Lhari fears.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he said gently. \"No. There won't be any war unless we start one.\r\nThe Lhari won't start any war. Believe me.\"\r\n\r\nBut inwardly, he sweated. What _would_ the Lhari do?\r\n\r\nThey had to wait for representatives of the Lhari Council to make the\r\njourney from their home galaxy; meanwhile they kept Bart in protective\r\ncustody. There was, of course, no question of sending him to a \"prison\r\nplanet\"; public opinion would have crucified any government that\r\nsuggested punishment for the man who had discovered a human world with\r\ndeposits of Catalyst A. Bart could claim an \"explorer's share,\" and\r\nRaynor One had lost no time in filing that claim on his behalf.\r\n\r\nBut he was lonely and anxious. They had confined him to a set of rooms\r\nhigh in the building overlooking the spaceport; from the balcony he\r\ncould see the ships landing and departing. Life went on, ships came and\r\nwent, and out there in the vast night of space, the suns and colors\r\nflamed and rolled, heedless of the little atoms that traveled and\r\nintrigued between them.\r\n\r\nA night came when the buzzer sounded and he opened the door to Raynor\r\nOne and Raynor Three.\r\n\r\n\"Better turn on your vision-screen, Bart. The Elder of the Lhari Council\r\nhas arrived with their official decision, and he's going to announce\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nBart waited, anxiously, pacing the room, while on the TV screen various\r\ndignitaries presented the Elder.\r\n\r\n\"We are the first race to travel the stars.\" A bald head, an ancient\r\nLhari face seamed like glazed pottery, looked at Bart from the screen,\r\nand Bart remembered when he had stood before that face, sick with\r\ndefeat. But now he need not pretend to hold his head erect.\r\n\r\n\"We have had a long and triumphant time as masters of the stars,\" the\r\nLhari said. \"But triumph and power will sicken and stagnate the race\r\nwhich holds them too long unchallenged. We reached this point once\r\nbefore. Then a Lhari captain, Rhazon of Nedrun, abandoned the safe ways\r\nof caution, and out of his blind leap in the blind dark came many good\r\nthings. Trade with the human race. Our Mentorian allies. A system of\r\nmathematics to take the hazards from our star-travel.\r\n\r\n\"Yet once again the Lhari had grown cautious and fearful. And a young\r\nman named Bartol took a blind leap into unknown darkness, all alone--\"\r\n\r\n\"Not alone,\" Bart said as if to himself, \"it took two men called\r\nBriscoe. And my father. And a couple of Raynors. And even a man called\r\nMontano, because without that, I'd never have decided--\"\r\n\r\n\"Like Rhazon of Nedrun, like all pioneers, this young man has been\r\ncursed by his own people, the very ones who will one day benefit from\r\nhis daring. He has found his people a firm footing among the stars. It\r\nis too late for the Lhari to regret that we did not sooner extend you\r\nthe hand of welcome there. You have climbed, unaided, to join us. For\r\ngood or ill, we must make room for you.\r\n\r\n\"But there is room for all. Competition is the lifeblood of trade, and\r\nwe face the future without fear, knowing that life still holds many\r\nsurprises for the living. I say to you: welcome to the stars.\"\r\n\r\nEven while Bart stood speechless with the knowledge of success, the door\r\nopened again, and Bart, turning, cried out in amazement.\r\n\r\n\"Tommy! Ringg! Meta!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure,\" Tommy exclaimed, \"we've got to celebrate,\" but Bart stopped,\r\nlooking past them.\r\n\r\n\"Captain Vorongil!\" he said, and went to greet the old Lhari. \"I thought\r\nyou'd hate me, _rieko mori_.\" The term of respect fell naturally from\r\nhis lips.\r\n\r\n\"I did, for a time,\" Vorongil said quietly. \"But I remembered the day we\r\nstood on Lharillis, by the monument. And that you risked--perhaps your\r\nlife, certainly your eyesight--to save us from death. So when the Elder\r\nasked for my estimate of your people, I gave it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought it sounded like you.\" Bart felt that his happiness was\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" Ringg cried, \"let's celebrate! Meta, you haven't even told\r\nhim that he's free!\"\r\n\r\nBut while the party got rolling, Bart wondered--free for what? And\r\nafter a little while he went out on the balcony and stood looking\r\ndown at the spaceport, where the _Swiftwing_ lay in shadow, huge,\r\nbeloved--renounced.\r\n\r\n\"What now, Bartol?\" Vorongil's quiet voice asked from his elbow. \"You're\r\nfamous--notorious. You're going to be rich, and a celebrity.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was wishing I could get away until the excitement dies down.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Vorongil, \"why don't you? The _Swiftwing_ ships out\r\ntonight, Bartol--for Antares and beyond. It will be a couple of years\r\nbefore your Eight Colors can be made over into an Interstellar line--and\r\nas Raynor One has said to me several times, he'll have to handle all\r\nthose details, for you're not of age yet.\r\n\r\n\"I've been thinking. Now that we Lhari must share space with your\r\npeople, you'll need experienced men for your ships. Unless we all want\r\nthe disasters born of trial and error, we Lhari had better help you\r\ntrain your men quickly and well. I want you to go back on the\r\n_Swiftwing_ with me. Not an apprentice, but representative of Eight\r\nColors, to act as liaison between men and Lhari--at least until your own\r\naffairs claim your attention.\"\r\n\r\nBehind them on the balcony, Tommy appeared, making signals to Bart: \"Say\r\nyes! Say yes, Bart! _I_ did!\"\r\n\r\nBart's eyes suddenly filled. Out of defeat he had won success beyond his\r\ngreatest hopes. But he did not feel all glad; he felt only a heavy\r\nresponsibility. Whether good or bad came of the gift he had snatched\r\nfrom the stars, would rest in large measure on his own shoulders. He was\r\ngoing back to space--to learn the responsibility that went with it.\r\n\r\n\"I accept,\" he said gravely.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, boy!\" Tommy dragged Ringg into a sort of war dance of exuberant\r\ncelebration, pointing at the flaring glow of the spaceport gates. \"Here,\r\nby grace of the Lhari, stands the doorway to all the stars,\" he quoted.\r\n\"Well, maybe you were here first. But look out--we're coming!\"\r\n\r\nA doorway to the stars. Bart had crossed that doorway once, frightened\r\nand alone. _Dad, if you could only know!_ The first interstellar ship of\r\nEight Colors was to bear the name _Rupert Steele_, but that was years in\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\nNow, looking at the _Swiftwing_, at Ringg and Tommy, at Raynor Three and\r\nVorongil, who would all be his shipmates in the new world they were\r\nbuilding, he felt suddenly very lonely again.\r\n\r\n\"Come in, Bart. It's your party,\" Meta said softly, and he felt her hand\r\nlying in his. He looked down at the pretty Mentorian girl. She would be\r\nwith him, too. And suddenly he knew he would never be lonely again.\r\n\r\nHis arm around Meta, his friends--man and Lhari--at his shoulder, he\r\nwent back to the celebration, to plan for the first intergalactic voyage\r\nto the stars.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe End\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHOR'S PROFILE\r\n\r\nMarion Zimmer Bradley was born in Albany, New York and before she\r\nstarted her writing career she was a file clerk, music teacher and a\r\ncarnival performer.
