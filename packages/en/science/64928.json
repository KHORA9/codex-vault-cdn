And in this they will surely\r\nnot be disappointed. It is perhaps a novel experience for one who has\r\nfor some years seriously meditated such a work himself to be asked to\r\nintroduce the work of another; but in the study of arms and armour all\r\nmen are brothers, and I take leave to say that we of this brotherhood\r\nknow little of the jealousies and divisions of opinion which beset the\r\nstudent in other historical details. The perusal of Mr. Clephan’s work\r\nhas shown me that it would have been impossible to undertake such a\r\nproject without unattainable leisure, tireless energy, deep research\r\nand very real devotion to the subject. Mr. Clephan has dealt with the\r\nsubject from a wide European point of view, and has amassed a vast\r\namount of information from German sources which has, up till now, been\r\ndenied to those unskilled in that language; and, with his copious notes\r\nand references, has made this material available for study, for which\r\nalone we must ever be deeply indebted to him.\r\n\r\nThe Tournament, as practised in Germany and towards the close of the\r\nsixteenth century in England, France and Italy, must have been a\r\nrather dull performance, as the minute regulations and the cumbersome\r\nequipment precluded that dash and intrepid onslaught which make the\r\ndescriptions by Froissart and other writers of his time such excellent\r\nreading. Even the gorgeous displays of Henry VIII leave us rather cold\r\nwhen we find that the king invariably won, and that the queen could\r\nstop the tilting at her pleasure, which was presumably when her lord\r\nhad had sufficient entertainment. We have only to note that the suit in\r\nthe Tower made for Henry VIII to fight on foot in the lists weighs 93\r\nlbs., to realize that no man could be strenuous or energetic in this\r\nequipment; and when we find that the horse in the sixteenth century\r\njoust had to carry a dead weight of 340 lbs., it will be manifest that\r\nhe could only amble gently along the tilt, and could not dash headlong\r\ndown the lists, as the artist would have us believe. The whole subject\r\nof arms and armour teems with such disillusioning; but to the earnest\r\nstudent these are taken with grace, because they are born of facts\r\nquarried out of masses of written and printed records with years of\r\nincessant perseverance and devotion.\r\n\r\nAfter the pioneer work of Meyrick and Hewitt, the interest in arms\r\nand armour died down for over half a century, but in the last ten or\r\nfifteen years it has revived, and its resurrection may be traced to\r\nwriters who, like Lord Dillon and Mr. Clephan, have striven to give\r\nus a real insight into the military life of nations, rather than\r\nhighly-coloured fantasies which have no foundation in fact. If Mr.\r\nClephan’s researches cause us to modify our views on certain aspects\r\nof the Tournament, I feel quite certain that all who have previously\r\nwritten on these lines will admit the new light he has brought to bear.\r\nThe audience he directly appeals to is small, but they will yield to\r\nstudents in no other branch of history or art in their keen devotion to\r\ntheir subject; and I trust I may conclude, in their name, by wishing\r\nMr. Clephan every success in the work before us, and, if I may enter\r\ninto the spirit of his subject, “Good jousting.”\r\n\r\n                                                   CHARLES FFOULKES\r\n\r\n    OFFICE OF THE ARMOURIES\r\n         H. M. TOWER OF LONDON\r\n              _29 August, 1917_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nMost of us owe our early impressions of the tournament to the\r\ndelightful account of the “Gentle and Joyous Passage of Arms” of Ashby\r\nde la Zouche, in the county of Leicester, given by Sir Walter Scott in\r\nhis fine romance _Ivanhoe_. But that eminent novelist, in presenting\r\nto his readers the picture of a _pas d’armes_ of the times of the\r\nlion-hearted Richard, took a poet’s licence by describing a jousting\r\nand _mêlée_ such as belonged, in many details, to a time later than\r\nRichard’s by some two and a half centuries. The knightly armour of the\r\nreign of King Richard was of chain-mail, while that of the times of\r\nHenry VI was, of course, a complete harness of plate. The first-named\r\nequipment is thus described by Sainte-Palaye: “_Une lance forte et\r\ndificile à rompre, un haubert ou haubergeon, c’est à dire, une double\r\ncotte de mailles, tissues de fer, à l’epreuve de l’épée, étoient les\r\narmes assignées aux Chevaliers._”[1]\r\n\r\nSir Walter’s account is thus hopelessly misleading in regard to its\r\nperiod, though admirably worked out in many other respects. There are\r\nancient romances of great historic value, in that they give nearly\r\ncontemporaneous details of the tournament of the fourteenth and\r\nfifteenth centuries, and represent many features which may be regarded\r\nas correct in the light of a close comparison with other records. That\r\nof _Petit Jehan de Saintré_, written by Anthoine de la Sale, in 1459,\r\nis one of these, and we owe much enlightenment to it.\r\n\r\nThere is great confusion among the works of chroniclers in regard to\r\nthe dates of many tournaments, and often it is impossible to reconcile\r\ntheir statements. The differences are, however, usually but slight.\r\n\r\nMr. ffoulkes, in his Preface to this work, draws attention to the large\r\namount of fable and exaggeration so often interwoven in many accounts\r\ngiven of the tournament, and to the necessity for presenting the\r\nsubject historically in its true light. In order to do this one must\r\ndiscard much that has been written concerning it throughout the ages\r\nand go back to original information, carefully sifted and compared, in\r\norder to arrive at some degree of truth.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, illuminations in MSS. must not be estimated at their\r\nface value, for, besides being often fantastic, they are rarely\r\ncontemporaneous with the events they portray; and the narrations of\r\nchroniclers were mostly written some time after the events in question,\r\nand often introduce details which really belong to a later age. Thus\r\nthe illustrated _Froissart_ in the British Museum,[2] which dates from\r\nabout the end of the fifteenth century, pictures a joust at the tilt at\r\nthe _pas d’armes_ held at St. Inglevert in the year 1389, a tournament\r\ndescribed in our chapter IV; but a tilt or barrier placed between the\r\ncombatants, along which they rode in opposite directions, was first\r\nemployed about the end of the first quarter of the century following.\r\nSuch anachronisms are very common in records of the tournament, so that\r\ncare and discrimination are required in their interpretation.\r\n\r\nThe works of Meyrick and Hewitt are of great historical value, and they\r\nafford much information carefully gathered from original documents.\r\nThis information has been copiously made use of by more recent authors\r\nwith but a scant or even no acknowledgment. It should be remembered,\r\nhowever, that these eminent and devoted historians were pioneers, so\r\nto speak, and much has been learnt of the tournament since their day;\r\nyet their labours form excellent foundations for the building up of a\r\nscientific superstructure.\r\n\r\nThe admirable version of _Freydal_, by Querin von Leitner, pictures\r\nthe jousts of the Emperor Maximilian I, especially those of the last\r\nquarter of the fifteenth century. It presents a veritable mine of\r\ninformation concerning the tournament of that period, placing the\r\ntechnique of the subject on a sound basis. Even this account, however,\r\nis hardly contemporaneous.\r\n\r\nThe interest in the subject flagged for a season, and until some\r\nquarter of a century ago but little more was heard of it. It was\r\nWendelin Boeheim, in his _Waffenkunde_, who set the ball rolling again;\r\nand since his book was written a number of learned papers have appeared\r\nin England and Germany dealing with the tournament, though in French\r\nliterature the subject has received but little attention. Among such\r\npapers those by Viscount Dillon, published in _Archæologia_ and the\r\n_Archæological Journal_, are very important. This writer has corrected\r\nmany mistakes made by the earlier authors and persistently handed down\r\nfrom one generation to another. Most of the writers would appear to\r\nhave regarded as gospel truths all statements made by Meyrick. These\r\nmistakes are most difficult to eradicate from our literature, for their\r\ncorrection has been made in publications such as those mentioned above,\r\nwhich are unfortunately only read by a select few.\r\n\r\nAll these learned books and scattered papers treat the subject more or\r\nless sectionally, and, so far as I know, there has been no work of any\r\nimportance published which attempts to deal with the subject as a whole\r\nfrom start to finish. This manifest want I have endeavoured to supply\r\nin the present volume.\r\n\r\nMy position for many years, up to the date of the war, as an official\r\nof the Verein für Historische Waffenkunde, gave me access to a mass of\r\noriginal information concerning what may be fitly termed the German\r\nperiod. Such information is not readily got at, and much of it has\r\nbeen embodied in the present volume. It is to such sources that we\r\nmust turn for many details, more particularly for those of a technical\r\nnature. These records, however, mainly relate to tournaments of the\r\nlast quarter of the fifteenth century (after the Burgundian Chronicles\r\ncease), to the whole of the sixteenth, and so up to the time when the\r\ninstitution fell into desuetude.\r\n\r\nMy thanks are due to Mr. Basil Anderton, M.A., the Public Librarian of\r\nNewcastle-upon-Tyne, for reading over parts of my MS. and for drawing\r\nattention to many books bearing on the subject of the tournament; to\r\nMr. Charles J. ffoulkes, B.LITT., F.S.A., Curator of the Armouries of\r\nthe Tower of London; to Mr. Frederick Walter Dendy, D.C.L., and Mr.\r\nSamuel T. Meynell, for some valuable suggestions; and to the University\r\nof Cambridge for the loan of books.\r\n\r\n                                                R.

These designations would seem to have\r\nbeen derived from “_tournier_,” to wheel round; though Claude Fauchet,\r\nwriting in the last quarter of the sixteenth century,[5] expresses the\r\nopinion that the word “_tournoi_” came about from the cavaliers running\r\npar tour, that is by turns at the quintain: “_fut premièrement appellé\r\nTournoy pource que les Cheualiers ŷ coururent par tour; rompans\r\npremièrement leur bois et lances contre vne Quintaine...._”\r\n\r\nMilitary games of a similar nature are often stated to have been\r\npractised in Germany earlier than this, and Favine in _Theatre of\r\nHonour and Knighthood_[6] prints a list of rules and ordinances for\r\nobservance at a “tournament” to be held at Magdeburg, as having been\r\nissued by the Emperor of Germany Henry I, surnamed the Fowler, 876-936,\r\na century and a half earlier than the date of the promulgation of\r\nthe rules of Pruilli. The German text, however, bears the impress\r\nof a later period than early in the tenth century, and this view is\r\nexpressed by Claude Fauchet, who gives the rules, which are curious\r\nenough for insertion here; and he mentions the authority from which\r\nFavine drew his statement.[7]\r\n\r\n      “_Sebastien Munster au troisiesme liure de sa\r\n    Geografie, certifie que Henry premier de ce nom viuant\r\n    enuiron l’an VCCCCXXXVI fit publier vn Tournoy, pour\r\n    tenir en la ville de Magdebourg qui est en Saxe,\r\n    lequel fut le premier, ＆ tenu l’an VCCCCXXXVIII.\r\n    Le mesme Munster recite douze articles de loix de Tournoy_:—\r\n\r\n      1. _Qui fera quelque chose contre la Foy._\r\n      2. _Qui aura fait quelque chose contre le sacré\r\n         Empire, et la Cesarce Majesté._\r\n      3. _Qui aura trahy son Seigneur, ou sans cause iceluy\r\n         delaisse fuyant en vne bataille: tué, ou meurdry ces\r\n         compagnons._\r\n      4. _Qui aura outragé fille, ou femme, de fait ou de\r\n         parolles._\r\n      5. _Qui aura falcifié vn seel, ou fait vn faux\r\n         serment.

Qui gaste les bledz ＆ vignes dont le\r\n         public est substanté._\r\n      9. _Qui mettra nouuelles impositions sans le sceu\r\n         de l’Empereur: ou ie croy qu’il entéd parler d’vn\r\n         Seigneur qui surchargera sa terre._\r\n      10. _Qui aura cómis adultere, ou rauy vierges ＆ pucelles._\r\n      11. _Qui fait marchandise pour reuendre._\r\n      12. _Qui ne pourra prouuer sa race de quatre grands\r\n          peres, soit battu ＆ chassé du Tournoy._”\r\n\r\nJousts and Tournaments were classed under the heading of _Hastiludia_\r\nor spear-play: as also was the behourd or buhurt, _Bohordicum_ in\r\nMediæval Latin,[8] a military exercise of a similar nature; though\r\nin what respect it differed from the joust or tournament is nowhere\r\nstated. That it was an exercise with lance and shield is clearly shown\r\nin a passage in _Concilium Albiense_.[9]\r\n\r\nThat the behourd was practised continuously for long after the\r\nintroduction of the joust and tournament is known by the fact of the\r\nissue of royal edicts for the prohibition of these exercises, as late\r\nas the reign of King Edward I.[10]\r\n\r\nThe origin of the joust does not appear to be less ancient than that\r\nof the tourney itself,[11] which it gradually almost supplanted; and\r\nit may have been suggested by the quintain. William of Malmesbury\r\nthus defines it:—Justa, jouste. _Monomachia ludicra, hastiludium\r\nsingulare._[12] The Bayeux tapestry shows a kind of combat with spears.\r\n\r\nThe terms “tourney” and “joust” are often confounded with each other,\r\nbut they are sharply different, the former being a battle in miniature,\r\nan armed contest of courtesy on horseback, troop against troop; while\r\nthe other is a single combat of mounted cavaliers, run with lances\r\nin the lists; though jousting was by no means confined to these\r\nenclosures; indeed, such contests were sometimes run in the open street\r\nor square of a town. Jousts were often included with the tourney,\r\nthough frequently held independently; and as the lance was the weapon\r\nof the former so was the sword greatly that of the latter. The lance\r\nwas to be directed at the body only, otherwise it was considered foul\r\nplay. The joust more especially was run in honour of ladies. These\r\nmartial games were much practised in all the countries of chivalry.\r\n\r\nThe chroniclers are vague in their definitions of the Round Table\r\ngame, the _Tabula Rotunda_, or as Matthew Paris calls it “_Mensa\r\nRotunda_.”[13] He expressly distinguishes it from the tournament,\r\nthough in what respect it differs from it he does not enlighten us. He\r\ndescribes a _tabula rotunda_, held at the Abbey of Wallenden in the\r\nyear 1252, which was attended by a great number of cavaliers, both\r\nEnglish and foreign, and states that on the fourth day of the meeting\r\na knight named Arnold de Montigney was pierced in the throat by a\r\nlance “_which had not been blunted as it ought to have been_.” The\r\nlance-head remained in the wound and death soon followed. We see from\r\nthis incident that already in the middle of the thirteenth century it\r\nwas customary to joust with blunted or rebated lances! In 1279 (8 Ed.\r\nI) a Round Table was held by Roger Earl of Mortimer, at his castle\r\nof Kenilworth, which is thus described in _Historia Prioratus de\r\nWigmore_[14]:—“He (Mortimer) invited a hundred knights and as many\r\nladies to an hastilude at Kenilworth, which he celebrated for three\r\ndays at a vast expense. Then he began the round table; and the golden\r\nlion, the prize for the triumphant knight, was awarded to him.” Dugdale\r\nstates that the reason for the institution itself was to assert the\r\nprinciple of equality and to avoid questions of precedence among the\r\nknights.\r\n\r\nIn some “Observations on the Institution of the Most Noble Order of\r\nthe Garter,” printed in _Archæologia_ of the year 1846,[15] it is\r\nstated that in 1343, King Edward III in imitation of King Arthur, the\r\ntraditional founder of British Chivalry, bent on reviving the fabled\r\nglories of a by-gone age, determined to hold a Round Table at Windsor\r\non the 19th of January, 1344. The intended meeting was proclaimed\r\nby heralds of the king, in France, Scotland, Burgundy, Hainault,\r\nFlanders, Brabant, and in the German Empire, offering safe-conducts to\r\nall foreign knights and esquires wishful to take part in it.[16] King\r\nEdward fixed the number of the tenans at forty, enrolling the bravest\r\nin the land; and he appointed that a “Feast” should be kept from year\r\nto year at Windsor on every following St. George’s Day. Walsingham,\r\nwriting about half a century after Froissart, states that in 1344 the\r\nKing began to build a house in Windsor Park, which should be called the\r\n“Round Table”; that it was circular in form, and 200 feet in diameter.\r\nIt is also stated that a circular table, made of wood, was constructed\r\nat Windsor sometime before 1356; and that the Prior of Merton was\r\npaid L26-13-4 for 52 oaks, taken from his woods near Reading, for the\r\nmaterial.[17] Walsingham relates that Philip of France, jealous of the\r\nfame of our king, had a table made on the Windsor model.\r\n\r\nMatthew of Westminster chronicles that a round table was held in 1352,\r\nwhich had a fatal ending.\r\n\r\nThere is an actual round table of ancient provenance hanging on the\r\neastern wall of the hall of the royal palace at Winchester, the reputed\r\n“painted table of Arthur,” and there are some remarks concerning\r\nit in the Winchester volume of the Archæological Institute, 1846,\r\ntelling all that is known concerning it. The hall itself may have been\r\nstanding in the reign of Henry III; and in the sixteenth century, and\r\nprobably long before, a round table was an appendage to it; but as to\r\nthe approximate date of its make there is no reliable evidence. The\r\nearliest historic reference to the table is by Hardyng, late in the\r\nreign of Henry VI or early in that of Edward IV, who alludes to it as\r\n“hanging yet” at Winchester; and Paulus Jovius tells us that the table\r\nwas shown to the emperor Charles V in 1520, when it had been newly\r\npainted for the “last” time, but that the marginal names had been\r\nrestored unskilfully. In the reign of Henry VIII a sum of _L66-16-11_\r\nwas expended in repairing the “_aula regis infra castrum de Wynchestre,\r\net le Round tabyll ibidem_.” John Lesley, bishop of Ross, said that he\r\nsaw the table not long before 1578, and that the names of the knights\r\nwere inscribed on its circumference; and a Spanish writer, who was\r\npresent at the marriage of Philip and Mary, thus describes the painting\r\non the table:—\r\n\r\n      “_Lors du mariage de Philip II. avec la reine Marie,\r\n    on montrait encore à Hunscrit la table ronde fabriquée\r\n    par Merlin: elle se composait de 25 compartemens\r\n    teintés en blank et en vert, lesquels se terminaient\r\n    en pointe au milieu, et allaient s’elargissant jusqu’à\r\n    la circonférence, et dans chaque division étaient\r\n    écrits le nom du cavalier et celui du roi. L’un de ces\r\n    compartemens appelé place de Judas, ou siége périlleux,\r\n    restait toujours vide._”\r\n\r\nThe forms of the lettering and general decoration of the table point to\r\na date in the reign of Henry VII or early in that of Henry VIII, but\r\nthis, of course, only applies to the painted enrichment. Whatever may\r\nbe the date of this table and its painting, they are both undoubtedly\r\nof considerable antiquity, probably from five to six centuries old.\r\n\r\nThe _fête d’armes_ held by Boucicaut at St. Ingelbert in 1389 (which\r\nis described in Chapter III), is called in the account of the meeting\r\na “table-ronde”; and the text would imply that the holding of a round\r\ntable meant a _hastilude_ at which the challengers or tenans kept open\r\nhouse to all comers, as well as meeting them in combat in the lists;\r\nand the institution is thus coupled with the banquet. The passage runs:—\r\n\r\n      “_Ainsi feit là son appareil moult grandement\r\n    et très-honnorablement messire Boucicaut, et feit\r\n    faire provisions de très-bon vins, et de tous vivres\r\n    largement, et à plain, et de tout ce qu’il convient si\r\n    plantureusement comme ‘pour tenir table rond à tout\r\n    venans’ tout le dict temps durant, et tout aux propres\r\n    despens de Boucicaut._”[18]\r\n\r\nThe same lavish hospitality was extended here as at Kenilworth in 1279,\r\nWindsor in 1344.\r\n\r\nIt is clear from various records that the tenans at a round table of\r\nthe thirteenth and fourteenth centuries sometimes fought under the\r\nnames of King Arthur’s knights, indeed, “Sir Galehos” appears among the\r\nnames of the knights inscribed on the actual round table at Winchester;\r\nand they also sometimes adopted the names of other legendary heroes,\r\nfor at a round table held at Valenciennes in 1344, at which the prize\r\nwas a peacock, victory was achieved by a band of cavaliers which fought\r\nunder the names of King Alexander’s knights.[19] The accounts given of\r\nKing Edward’s tournament at Windsor, and that of the later Boucicaut’s\r\n_pas d’armes_, both of which are called round tables, may be said to\r\ndefine sufficiently what a “Round Table” of the fourteenth century\r\nreally was; and we fail to find any material difference from other\r\nmeetings of the kind and period.\r\n\r\nFavine in _Theatre of Honour and Knighthood_[20] refers to “_Hastiludia\r\nRotunda_” as being practice for cavaliers “to sit well their horses,\r\nto keepe themselues fast in their saddles and stirups. For, if any man\r\nfell, and his Horse upon him, at these encounterings with their lances,\r\nlightly worse did befall him before he could any way get forth of the\r\nPreasse. But others came to heauior fortune, their liues expyring in\r\nthe place, being trod and trampled on by others”—but all this would\r\napply to the ordinary _mêlée_. This form of tourney was much in favour\r\nduring the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, but we hear no more of\r\nround tables after that.\r\n\r\nThe Quintain (_quintana_) and Running at the Ring (_Ringelrennen_,\r\n_Corso all’ Annello_) were closely allied with the joust, and were\r\npractised in preparation for it; the chief objects for attainment in\r\nthe former being a correct aim, to remain steady in the saddle after\r\nimpact with the figure, and deftly to get rid of the stump of the\r\nbroken lance. The quintain was a more ancient game than the joust, and\r\nindeed, not improbably, it gave rise to it; and being free from the\r\nrisk of personal danger, was a sport and pastime of the people. The\r\ngame assumed many forms, though it was chiefly a means of practice\r\nwith the lance, sword, baston and battle-axe, indulged in by the young\r\naspirants for knighthood as well as by the citizens and yeomanry. The\r\noriginal quintain was merely a post set up, against which the strokes\r\nwere directed or against a shield hanging from it, with the same\r\nobject in view. Later, the post developed into a human figure, usually\r\nfashioned as a Turk or Saracen, who held a wooden sword in his hand.\r\nThe objective of the lance was the space between the eyes; and the\r\nfigure was placed on a pivot, and so constructed that a misdirected\r\nstroke, that is a hit too much on one side or the other, would cause\r\nit to spin round with great velocity, dealing the tyro a smart blow\r\nwith the sword. Another form was a bag of sand, from which the clumsy\r\noperator was apt to receive a buffet as it swung round or to have the\r\ncontents expended over his horse and person; and there were other\r\nsimilar varieties of the game. The water quintain was practised from\r\na boat, rapidly propelled by rowers; while the player stood at the\r\nbow, his lance couched and directed towards a shield, hung from a post\r\nstanding in the water. The quintain continued to be a popular game\r\nright through the seventeenth century, and could be played on foot as\r\nwell as on horseback. A picture of a quintain is given on a miniature\r\nin the _Chroniques de Charlemagne_, in the Burgundian Library at\r\nBrussels, and is reproduced by Lacroix in _Military and Religious Life\r\nin the Middle Ages and Renaissance_.\r\n\r\nRunning or Tilting at the Ring was merely a later form of the quintain.\r\nAn upright shaft or post was holed at intervals for the reception\r\nof a rounded bar, socketed into it at right-angles, from which hung\r\nthe ring placed on a level with the player’s eye; and the horseman,\r\ncouching his lance, rode towards it at full gallop with the object\r\nof transfixing it. When fairly hit the ring became detached by the\r\naction of side springs and remained on the head of the lance. Pluvinal\r\ngives particulars of the game as practised at the beginning of the\r\nseventeenth century; it was much in vogue at the court of Louis XIV.\r\nFor running at the ring the lance was much shorter than that employed\r\nin jousting, its length was 10 ft. 7 in. and weight 7 lbs. There is\r\na specimen at Dresden, tipped with a cone to hold the ring when hit,\r\nand there is naturally no vamplate. It will be realised what excellent\r\npractice these sports afforded for the joust and tourney. Both games\r\nare described in Strutt’s _Sports and Pastimes_. MS., Ashmole 837, fol.\r\n185, furnishes an instance of the game:—\r\n\r\n        “These persons here vnderwrytten / beinge one the\r\n      kinges parte the playntyff / And the other wt therle\r\n      of Rutland defendant / dyd Run at ye Rynge iiij course\r\n      every man / at wch tyme none toke the Ryng but only Mr\r\n      hayward / and Mr Constable beinge wt the defendant /\r\n      whome are apoynted when yt shall please his grace / for\r\n      them to Rune agayne / he wch shall take the Ring furst\r\n      shall have the prysse /\r\n\r\n    wt the kynges matie                  wt therle of Rutland\r\n      the lord marques of Northampton      the lord Fyzewater\r\n      therle of Worcester                  the lord hastynges\r\n      therle of wormewood                  the lord chevers (?Chandos)\r\n      the lord admyrall                    Sr Ambrows Dudley\r\n      the lord lyle                        Sr jorge hayward\r\n      the lord Strange                     Mr norrys\r\n      Sr thomas Wroughton                  Sr William Stafford\r\n      Mr Barnaby                           Sr Anthony Sturley\r\n      Mr throughmorton                     Mr Pownynge\r\n      harry nevell                         Mr Clement paston\r\n      Sr harry gates                       Sr William Cobham\r\n      Sr harry Sydney                      Mr Constable\r\n      Mr Chetewood                         Mr payne (?prynne)\r\n      Mr phylpott                          Mr. warcope\r\n\r\n      This beinge done came VI one ether partye to the tourney whose\r\n      names are hereafter named\r\n\r\n    The Kynges syd                       Therle of Rutland\r\n      therle of Worcester                  lord Fyzewater\r\n      the lord lysseley                    Sr Ambrows Dudley\r\n      Mr harry nevell                      Sr George hayward\r\n      Mr Sydney                            Mr pownynges\r\n      Sr thomas wroughton                  Mr paston\r\n      Sr harry gates                       Mr payne (?prynne).”\r\n\r\nProbably written by Sir Gilbert Dethick, Garter King of Arms.\r\n\r\nJudicial Combats are also properly classed under the general heading\r\nof the Tournament, and these duels, on foot and on horseback, were\r\nfought greatly subject to its rules and regulations. An account of this\r\nsingular institution follows after the tournament proper.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[3] “_Militaria exercitia, quae nullo interveniente odio, sed pro solo\r\nexercitio, atque ostentatione virium._”\r\n\r\n[4] “_Torneamentorum repertorum Gaufridum II, Dominum Pruliaci_ (de\r\nPruilli) _in Andibus agnoscit Chronicon Turonense; Anno 1066.

The term “_à outrance_,” however, was used\r\nnot infrequently in _Chapitres d’Armes_ or articles of combat where no\r\nfatal ending was in contemplation; they were encounters of courtesy in\r\nfact, though contests in which battle-axes, sharp swords and pointed\r\nlances were employed.\r\n\r\nThe chroniclers of the joust and tournament of the earlier centuries\r\nexhibit a lack of technical knowledge, and the terms they employ are\r\noften mixed and conflicting; and, indeed, this confusion continues\r\nthroughout later centuries also, to an extent making any exact\r\ndefinition of terms extremely difficult.\r\n\r\nWhatever information we possess regarding tournaments of the twelfth\r\nand thirteenth centuries is greatly derived from the Mediæval Latin\r\nchronicles of the Anglo-Norman monks; but the material they furnish\r\nrequires to be used with discretion, owing to the frequent unhappy\r\nblending of fact and legend, a lack of professional knowledge, and a\r\nway of reporting things of half a century or more ago in harmony with\r\nthe environment of the time of writing. Among the chroniclers of the\r\ntournament of the period we are immediately dealing with, are William\r\nof Malmesbury, whose _History of the Kings of England_ finishes at\r\nthe year 1142; Wace, who wrote the _Roman de Rou_, on Rollo and the\r\nsucceeding Dukes of Normandy, in 1160; William of Newbury, 1197; Roger\r\nof Hoveden, 1201.[21] William Fitzstephen was an eye-witness of the\r\nevents he relates; the prolific and illuminating Matthew Paris, 1259;\r\nRobert of Gloucester, who died in 1290; and Matthew of Westminster,\r\n1307.\r\n\r\nMuch information concerning the body-armour of the twelfth and\r\nthirteenth centuries has been derived from seals, and particularly from\r\nthose of the kings of England; also from illuminations in chronicles,\r\nrepresentations on tapestry and carvings in ivory. Military effigies\r\nand brasses have also proved of immense value, for they enable us to\r\nfill in many of the gaps left in the recitals of chroniclers, and\r\nafford precise information as to the knightly equipment for battle,\r\nas far as least as the presence of the surcoat will permit. We have,\r\nindeed, been favoured among the nations in the preservation of so many\r\nof these monuments. There are but few brasses of the thirteenth century\r\nexisting, though effigies are very numerous. Sad it is that so many of\r\nthese priceless memorials have been lost or thoughtlessly mutilated;\r\nbut their very important bearing upon history was but faintly\r\nrecognised much before the nineteenth century began. Many of them had\r\nbeen thrown on the rubbish heap to make way for some trivial and often\r\nmischievous alteration, or lost when some of our finest churches were\r\nspoilt by what is so often miscalled restoration; and many even of the\r\neffigies left to us have been exposed to a process of tinkering by\r\nthoughtless hands. Not a detail is missing on many of those monuments\r\nthat remain, and even colours are indicated.\r\n\r\nWilliam of Newbury states that tournaments first appear in England\r\nin the troubled reign of King Stephen, 1135-1154; and that they\r\nwere introduced from France by the Norman nobles is clear from\r\nthe expressions employed by Matthew Paris concerning them, viz.:\r\n“Conflictus Gallicus” and “batailles francaises.” Lombarde[22] states\r\nthat “the kings of this realm before King Stephen, would not suffer\r\nit to be frequented within their land; so that, such as for exercise\r\nin that feate in armes, were driven to passe over the seas, and to\r\nperforme in some different place in a foreigne countrie: but afterwards\r\nKing Stephen in his time allowed it.”[23] It was the Norman knights\r\nwho introduced the employment and couching of the lance in England.\r\nOf that age we have the remarkable description of the martial sports\r\nof London by William Fitzstephen. He tells us ‘that every Sunday in\r\nLent, immediately after dinner it was customary for great crowds of\r\nLondoners, mounted on war-horses, well trained to perform the necessary\r\nturnings and evolutions, to ride into the fields in distinct bands,\r\narmed “_hastilibus ferro dempto_,” with shields and headless lances;\r\nwhere they exhibited representations of battle, and went through a\r\nvariety of warlike exercises: at the same time many of the young\r\nnoblemen who had not received the honour of knighthood, came from\r\nthe King’s court, and from the houses of the great barons, to make\r\na trial of their skill in arms; the hope of victory animating their\r\nminds. The youth being divided into opposite companies, encountered\r\none another; in one place they fled, and others pursued, without being\r\nable to overtake them; in another place one of the bands overtook and\r\nover-turned the other.’\r\n\r\nRobert of Gloucester, in his _Chronicle_ in verse, which ends shortly\r\nbefore the accession of King Edward I, writes concerning William Rufus:—\r\n\r\n    “Stalwarde he was ＆ hardy ＆ god knyght, thorn al thyng\r\n    In batayle ＆ in ‘tornemnes’ er than he were Kyng.”[24]\r\n\r\nbut this of course has not the value of contemporary history.\r\n\r\nThe knight-errant of the twelfth century and even later often spent\r\nthe evening of his days as an anchorite, undergoing many self-imposed\r\npenances, fastings and flagellations in expiation of many acts of\r\nviolence and even oppression of his active career.\r\n\r\nThe tournaments of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries were\r\ncharacterized by all the romantic fire of knight-errantry, though they\r\nwere often rough and disorderly, and not infrequently degenerated\r\ninto real battles or free fights, in which many of the combatants\r\nwere seriously injured or killed. At the meeting held at Neuss, near\r\nCologne, in 1240, sixty of the combatants are stated to have been\r\nkilled. In England an Earl of Salisbury died from his hurts; his\r\ngrandson, Sir William Montague, was killed when jousting with his own\r\nfather; and many prominent knights and nobles were so injured in the\r\ntourney that they never regained their health. Tournaments generally\r\ntended to become milder as rules, regulations and limitations were\r\nenacted for their government; but it was not before the reign of King\r\nEdward I that they were brought under any regular disciplined system of\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\nAfter the reign of King Stephen these martial exercises often came\r\nunder the ban of both church and state, the former even going to the\r\nlength of excommunication and the refusal of Christian burial to the\r\nfallen. Pope Gregory issued a bull against them in 1228, and there were\r\nother bulls.[25] King Henry II discouraged them and issued edicts\r\nagainst them; and we are told by William of Newbury that many young\r\ncavaliers travelled from England to enjoy their favourite pastime in\r\nother lands, especially France. Tournaments were revived in England,\r\nsays Jocelin of Brakelond,[26] after the return of the heroic Richard\r\nfrom the Holy Land, who granted licences for holding them; and from\r\nthis time forward unlicensed tourneying was treated as an offence\r\nagainst the crown. Roger de Hoveden writes in _Annals_, under the year\r\n1194 (in translation):—“King Richard ordered tournaments to be held in\r\nEngland, which he confirmed by charter; but that all wishing to tourney\r\nshould pay for the privilege according to rank—viz., an earl, 20 marks\r\nof silver; a baron, 10 marks; a knight, holding land, 4 marks; and any\r\nwho were landless, 2 marks; and no knight was permitted to enter any\r\nlists without first having paid his fee.” The charter of this grant was\r\ndelivered into the custody of William, Earl of Salisbury; and Hubert\r\nFitz-Walter, the king’s chief-justice, appointed his brother, Theobald\r\nFitz-Walter, to be collector.\r\n\r\nHoc ett Breve, Dni Regis Ricardi I. missum Dno Cantuariensi, de\r\nconcessione Torneamentorum in Anglia.\r\n\r\nHeac est forma Pacis fervandae a Torneatoribus (Harl. MS. 237).[27]\r\n\r\nTournaments became controlled by royal ordinances, and any infraction\r\nof the rules laid down was punishable with the forfeiture of horse\r\nand armour, imprisonment and other penalties; though at times the\r\nregulations would seem to have been very loosely interpreted or\r\nentirely disregarded. This assumption of control by the state had\r\nbeen brought about by various causes quite apart from the frequently\r\ndisorderly nature of the meetings, and the large number of casualties\r\ninvolved; though these were the ostensible reasons often given for the\r\ninterdiction of all unauthorized gatherings of the kind. Much, however,\r\ndepended on the character and temperament of the reigning monarch,\r\nand the condition of order or otherwise prevailing in the country at\r\nthe time. At tournaments, whether held by royal licence or not, the\r\ncombatants were divided into two camps or parties; and they gathered\r\ntogether large concourses of spectators, who were too apt to become\r\nstrong and eager partisans, as we see at the football games of to-day;\r\nthe unpopular side being sometimes assailed with volleys of stones,\r\nsome discharged from slings. These meetings were thus frequently looked\r\nupon with disfavour by the powers that be, and were either entirely\r\nprohibited, or licences were refused in troublous times; for the\r\nassemblage of so many influential knights and powerful barons with\r\ntheir feudatories, coming from all parts of the kingdom, constituted a\r\ndanger to the state in affording opportunities for cabals, sedition and\r\nother disorders, and, indeed, tumults frequently occurred. Tournaments\r\nwere very popular in France during the reign of Philip Augustus; and\r\nPère Daniel relates an incident of that reign affording a striking\r\nexample of the large gatherings that assembled. An unexpected attack\r\nhaving been made on the town of Alençon, the king was enabled to enrol\r\na sufficient force at a tournament being held in the neighbourhood at\r\nthe time to repel it. Jousting was not much practised in France at that\r\ntime or during the thirteenth century, the cavaliers of that country\r\npreferring the _mêlée_.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1196 King Philip Augustus “sent vnto King Richard,\r\nrequiring him to appoint fiue champions, and he would appoint other\r\nfiue for his part, which might fight in listes, for triall of all\r\nmatters in controusee betwixt them, so to avoid the shedding of more\r\nguiltlesse bloud. King Richard accepted the offer, with the proviso\r\nthat either King might be of the number, that is the French King one of\r\nthe fiue vpon the French part; and King Richard one of the fiue vpon\r\nthe English part. But this condition would not be granted.”[28]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1250 “was a great tornie and iusts holden at Brackley,\r\nwhen the earle of Gloucester (contrarie to his accustomed manner)\r\nfauoured the part of the strangers, whereby they prevailed. In so much\r\nthat William de Valance handled one Sir William de Odingesselles verie\r\nroughlie, the same Sir William being a right worthy knight.”[29]\r\n\r\nIn 1251 King Henry III forbad the holding of a round table[30] and\r\nmany examples of such prohibitions are given in _Foedera_. Yet,\r\nmeetings of the kind were often held in England in spite of them, for\r\nthe young cavaliers, imbued with the chivalrous spirit of the age,\r\ndeclined being balked of their favourite pastime and were willing to\r\nrun some risks for its gratification. In the reign of Henry III the\r\nking admonishes his subjects “to offend not by tourneying,” and, “by\r\nthe advice of parliament enacted, that all who (without leave) should\r\nkeep a tournament, should forfeit their estates, and their children to\r\nbe disinherited.”[31] As late as the reign of King Edward II an edict\r\nwas issued against the practice, the ordinance running “_Turneare_,\r\n_burdeare_, _justas facere_, _aventuras quaerere_.”[32] Prohibitions\r\nagainst tournaments were issued in the years 1220, 1234, 1255 and 1299.\r\nIn normal times, however, they were often encouraged by the crown,\r\nand were presided over, and even taken part in, by kings and princes.\r\nMatthew of Westminster states that it was customary for newly made\r\nknights to pass over to the Continent to show their mettle by feats\r\nof arms; and that King Henry III knighted eighty gentlemen on one\r\noccasion, who all went abroad, accompanied by Prince Edward, to take\r\npart in tournaments.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of tournaments there were only five authorized\r\nlists (_champs clos_) in England, and they were all south of the\r\nTrent. At a later period these enclosures were usually placed in the\r\nneighbourhood of a large town where there was a hall spacious enough\r\nfor the banquet and the dance; the size of the lists being regulated\r\nby the number of cavaliers expected to take part. Those of the twelfth\r\ncentury were open at the sides, a barrier standing at each end; later\r\nthey were made quadrangular in shape, longer than broad by one-fourth.\r\nThey were enclosed by a double row of palisading, high enough to make\r\nit impossible for a horse to leap over; the space between the rows\r\naffording a place of refuge for the varlets (ephebi) and attendants.\r\nThe _rôle_ of the varlets was to rush in and steady their masters in\r\nthe saddle, when swaying after their careers; and, when unhorsed, to\r\nextricate and drag them, as opportunity offered, out of the press or\r\nfrom among the horse’s hoofs in the _mêlée_; for they were unable to\r\nhelp themselves in their heavy armour. This duty was both difficult\r\nand dangerous, but they had to manage as best they could. Openings\r\nwere left at either end of the lists for entrance and exit, and\r\nmovable barriers were provided for closing them when required. A thick\r\ncovering of sand was strewn on the ground, or it was well mulched\r\nwith tanning refuse so as to provide a soft bed for breaking the\r\nforce of the fall of a cavalier when unseated. The lists were gaily\r\ndecorated with tapestry, bunting and heraldic devices; a tribune for\r\nthe umpire or judge, and benches for the spectators, were provided;\r\nas well as special galleries for the ladies, which were often adorned\r\nwith gold and silver embroideries. Two pavilions were pitched for the\r\nuse of the leaders, which were removed before the commencement of the\r\ntourney. The scene presented by a tournament must have been brilliant\r\nin the extreme; and the element of danger involved would add greatly\r\nto the interest and excitement of the spectators. Permanent lists\r\nwere often surrounded by a ditch or moat. The marshals of the lists,\r\nkings of arms, heralds and pursuivants-at-arms were stationed within\r\nthe enclosure to note the various incidents taking place among the\r\ncombatants; and it was the duty of the first-named to see that the\r\nrules of chivalry and general regulations were strictly observed.\r\nTrumpets announced the entry of each competitor, who was followed\r\ninto the lists by his esquires; and flourishes of music were heard\r\nat intervals to animate the combatants, and to mark special feats of\r\ngallantry. Each knight usually bore on his person some token of his\r\nlady-love, which was disposed on his helmet, lance or shield. The\r\narmour and horses of the vanquished fell as spoil to the victors,\r\nunless ransomed by payment in money; this, however, was the case only\r\nin contests of courtesy. The jousting at a tournament usually ended\r\nwith “_le coup ou la lance des Dames_,” a homage to the fair sex\r\njoyfully rendered.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that blunted lances were in use in 1252, but we have not\r\nfound any record of the coronal, a lance-head formed like a flattened\r\ncrown (whence the name), before very early in the fourteenth century,\r\nwhen it appears on a picture in a MS. in the British Museum.[33]\r\nCavaliers frequently successful in the tourney enriched themselves by\r\nthe forfeiture of the horses and armour of the vanquished.\r\n\r\nThe routine of an early tournament is described in Codex 69 of the\r\nHarleian MS.[34] It is first proclaimed over a wide area; and on\r\nassemblage the cavaliers, mounted on horseback, are divided into two\r\nparties or squadrons, the challengers and the challenged. Each troop\r\nusually varied in number from twelve to twenty, and was headed by its\r\nown leader; the weapons were pointless swords with rebated edges. The\r\ntwo bodies then take up positions at opposite ends of the lists; the\r\nonset is sounded, “_Lasseir les aler_,” and they engage in combat\r\nuntil the signal is given to cease fighting. Various perquisites fall\r\nto the superintending Norroy King at Arms, and he and the heralds\r\nare paid their expenses and six crowns of “nail money” for affixing\r\nthe cote-armour of the two leaders in front of their pavilions.\r\nAn illustration on a MS. of the thirteenth century in the royal\r\nlibrary[35] is reproduced in _Sports and Pastimes_. It pictures the\r\nentry on horseback of the two baron-leaders into the lists, wearing\r\nchain-mail and pointed bascinets, and with their horses trapped; they\r\nbear no weapons. The King of Arms, in civil dress, is standing between\r\nthem holding their banners, one in each hand. Trumpeters are seen in\r\nthe background.\r\n\r\nThe presence of ladies graced the tournament, and they were treated\r\nwith great deference; the names and deeds of the successful champions\r\nwere submitted to them, and it was they who awarded and presented\r\nthe prizes. The days of combat usually closed with the banquet and\r\nthe dance. The tourney from the first was confined to men of noble\r\nbirth, though this rule was not so strictly enforced in England as in\r\nGermany and France, where all not of the privileged class were strictly\r\nexcluded.\r\n\r\nThe first mention we have found of prizes at tournaments is in 1279,\r\nwhen, at the Round Table held at Kenilworth in that year, the prize (a\r\ngolden lion) was awarded to Sir Roger Mortimer; but they do not seem to\r\nhave become general until much later.\r\n\r\nHenry III, on his marriage with Eleanor of Provence, in 1236, held a\r\ntournament for eight successive days; and according to Matthew Paris,\r\nthere was one at Northampton in 1247, another at Nebridge in 1248.\r\n\r\nThe tournaments held during the reign of Richard I were frequently\r\ninterdicted by the Church owing to the brutal character of many of\r\nthem; and Jocelin of Brackelond tells the story of a number of knights\r\nwho held one between Thetford and Bury St. Edmunds, in spite of the\r\nfiat of the abbot. Another took place soon after, which had also been\r\nprohibited; and all who had taken part in it were excommunicated.\r\nMatthew Paris describes a tournament held at Rochester in 1251, at\r\nwhich foreigners contended with English knights. There was great\r\nbitterness at the time between some of the nationalities owing to very\r\nrough treatment that had been experienced by some English knights\r\nabroad; and all rules and regulations were thrown to the winds at\r\nRochester, the proceedings degenerating there into a free fight. The\r\nEnglish set upon the foreigners with staves, beating them severely,\r\nand chased them into the town, to which they fled for refuge. Another\r\ninstance of this kind may be cited in an account given by Matthew\r\nof Westminster of a case in 1253, when the Earl of Gloucester and a\r\ncompanion took part in a tournament abroad, at which they were so\r\nroughly handled as to require fomentations and baths before they were\r\nin a condition to return to England. Trivet relates a further striking\r\nexample in a case, lawless and brutal in its character, which received\r\nthe name in history “_La petite Bataille de Chalòns_.” Edward I, King\r\nof England, was travelling through France in the year 1274 on his way\r\nhome from the Holy Land to take possession of the crown, when he was\r\ninvited by the Count de Chalôns to take part in a tournament to be\r\nheld in the open, near the town of Chalôns, with a certain number of\r\nhis followers. At an early stage of the contest the Count, a knight\r\nof unusual strength, forcing his way through the _mêlée_ attacked the\r\nKing with great vigour and impetuosity; and casting away his weapons\r\nthrew his arms around King Edward’s neck, hoping to unhorse him. The\r\nKing, however, being a tall and powerful man kept his saddle, and at\r\nthe moment of the greatest pressure cut fiercely at his adversary,\r\ndragged him from his horse and threw him heavily to the ground. The\r\nexasperation of the French cavaliers on seeing their leader fall was\r\nvery great, and for a time a real battle ensued, in which the outside\r\nfollowers of both sides took an active part, the English using their\r\nterrible bows: but some degree of order having been at length restored\r\nthe count surrendered to the King and acknowledged him to be the\r\nvictor. After this tournament laying hands on an opponent was strictly\r\nforbidden. Thomas of Walsingham also gives a spirited account of this\r\nmeeting, which runs on similar lines.[36]\r\n\r\nAt Whitsuntide in the year 1256 great jousting was held at Blei, when\r\nthe Lord Edward, afterwards King Edward I, “first began to shew proofs\r\nof his chiualrie.” In one of these encounters “William de Longspee was\r\nso brused that he could never after recover his former strength.”[37]\r\n\r\n“In the ninth year of King Edward’s reign, the feast of the round table\r\nwas kept at Warwike with great and sumptuous triumph.”[38]\r\n\r\nThe Round Table assembled at Kenilworth by Sir Roger Mortimer has been\r\nalready referred to in the section devoted to the Tabula Rotunda, and\r\nHardyng in his _Chronicle_[39] thus pictures it:\r\n\r\n    “And in the yere a thousand was full then\r\n     Two hundred also sixty and nynetene,[40]\r\n     When Sir Roger Mortimer so began\r\n     At Kelyngworth, the round table as was sene,\r\n     Of a thousand Knygts for dicipline,\r\n     Of young menne, after he could devise\r\n     Of Turnementes, and justes to exercise.\r\n\r\n    “A Thousand Ladies, excellyng in beautee\r\n     He had also there, in tentes high above\r\n     The justes, that thei might well and clerely see\r\n     Who justed beste, there for their Lady Love\r\n     For whole beautie, it should the Knightes move\r\n     In armes so eche other to revie\r\n     To get a fame in play of Chivalry.”\r\n\r\nHardyng died about the year 1465, nearly two centuries after the events\r\nhe narrates.\r\n\r\nThe lance, or glaive as it is often called, of the eleventh and twelfth\r\ncenturies[41] was quite straight and smooth; a vamplate was added in\r\nthe fourteenth, small at first but larger later, for the protection of\r\nthe right arm. The lance for jousting was made of soft wood, so as to\r\nsplinter easily.\r\n\r\nA manuscript in the Record Office, transferred from the Tower about\r\n1855, entitled _Emptiones facte per manum Adinetti Cissoris et visu\r\nAlbini ＆ Roberti de Dorset contra Torniamentum de Parco de Windsore,\r\nnono die Julii anno Sexto_ (a Roll of Purchases made for the tournament\r\nheld at Windsor Park in the year 1278), is copied in _Archæologia_ of\r\nthe year 1814.[42] This document is of rare value in giving particulars\r\nof the equipment of the cavaliers engaged in tournaments of the last\r\nquarter of the thirteenth century, besides mentioning other matters of\r\ninterest. Thirty-eight cavaliers took part in the tournament at Windsor\r\nPark, twelve of the highest rank being styled _digniores_. Among these\r\nwere the Earls of Cornwall, Gloucester, Warren, Lincoln, Pembroke and\r\nRichmond;[43] and there were several foreign knights present. Many\r\nof the cavaliers whose names appear on the roll had been with King\r\nEdward in the Holy Land. Both arms and armour[44] were provided for\r\nthe occasion for all the cavaliers taking part. Thirty-seven of the\r\noutfits ranged in cost from 7_s._ to 25_s._ each; that for the Earl of\r\nLincoln, however, was much higher than any of the others, being 33_s._\r\n4_d._ The equipments must thus have differed widely in quality and\r\nembellishment. The armours were of leather gilt, each suit consisting\r\nof a coat-of-fence (being a “quiretta”[45] of leather), brassards of\r\nbuckram, a surcoat (the material for the majority of these garments\r\nbeing carda,[46] but those for the four earls were of cindon silk), a\r\npair of ailettes, of leather and carda,[47] two crests (one for the\r\nman, the other for the horse), a shield of wood heraldically ensigned,\r\na helm of leather, and a sword of whalebone and parchment, silvered\r\nover. The shields of wood cost 5_d._ each, without emblazonment; the\r\nswords 7_d._ each, and 25_s._ was paid for silvering the blades, and\r\n3_s._ 6_d._ for gilding the hilts. The helmets for the “_digniores_”\r\nwere gilded at an expense of 12_s._, the others silvered. Each helmet\r\ncost 2_s._, and the ailettes 8_d._ the pair. Eight hundred little bells\r\n(_grelots_) were provided, to be used in necklets for the horses;\r\nsixteen skins for making bridles; twelve dozen silken cords for tying\r\non the ailettes;[48] and seventy-six calf-skins for making crests. The\r\ncuirasses and helmets were made by Milo, the currier; and the cost of\r\ncarriage for the whole of the sets from London was 3_s._ The sum total\r\nfor all these outfits provided in England was £80 11_s._ 8_d._; but\r\nsome other purchases were made in France, and in the list are items\r\nfor saddles and horse furniture. There is no mention of lances, and\r\nmany of the items scheduled are only open to conjecture. Sir Roger de\r\nTrumpington, whose effigy lies in Trumpington Church, Cambridgeshire,\r\nwas among those taking part in the tournament. If one can imagine this\r\npassage of arms, its participants armed with swords of whalebone and\r\nparchment, with their arm-defences of buckram, it does not seem a very\r\ndangerous affair, though a rough enough sport.\r\n\r\nThere is another document of about the same period of the highest\r\nimportance, viz. the _Statuta de Armis_, or _Statutum Armorum in\r\nTorniamentis_. This was drawn out at the request of the earls and\r\nbarons of England and by the king’s command, and affords much\r\ninformation as to the equipment for the tourney late in the thirteenth\r\ncentury, the usages to be observed, and the regulations as to the\r\nheralds, esquires, and varlets. There are several copies extant, one of\r\nwhich, and that perhaps the most reliable, may be seen in the Bodleian\r\nLibrary. Part of the text is reproduced by Hewitt in his invaluable\r\nwork on ancient armour,[49] and the document is referred to in\r\n_Archæologia_ of the year 1814.[50] These statutes provide that:—\r\n\r\n      No “conte,” baron or other chevalier shall henceforth be\r\n    attended by more than three armed esquires, who shall all\r\n    bear the cognizance of their master.\r\n\r\n      No knight or esquire taking part in any tournament shall\r\n    bear a pointed sword or dagger, a staff or baston, but\r\n    only a broadsword for tourneying. All should be armed\r\n    with “mustilers;”[51] “quisers;”[52] “espaulers;”[53] and\r\n    “bacyn,”[54] and no more.\r\n\r\n      If any “conte,” baron or other chevalier break any of\r\n    the rules of the tourney, he shall, with the assent and\r\n    command of the Seigneurs, Sire Edward, fiz le Rey; Sire\r\n    Eumond, frère le Rey; Sire William de Valence; Sire Gilbt de\r\n    Clare; and Cunto Nichole,[55] lose horse and armour and be\r\n    imprisoned at the discretion of the said court of honour,\r\n    and all disputes shall be referred to it for settlement.\r\n\r\n      Any esquire to a knight breaking the regulations in any\r\n    way should lose horse and armour and be imprisoned for three\r\n    years; and none was allowed to raise up a fallen knight but\r\n    his own appointed esquire, bearing his device. Spectators\r\n    were prohibited the wearing of armour or the carrying of\r\n    arms. Etc.\r\n\r\nMay we see in the comparative mildness of these rules, and the control\r\nexercised by the court of honour, some results of King Edward’s own\r\ndangerous experiences at the Chalôns tournament.\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting fact that the effigies of two of the members of\r\nthis distinguished committee have been preserved, viz.: those of Edmund\r\nCrouchback, whose sword-belt is enriched with heraldic bearings; and\r\nWilliam de Valance. Both are in Westminster Abbey. The figure of the\r\nformer wears the coif or hood of mail; the body is covered by a surcoat\r\nwith long sleeves and reaching nearly to the ankles; but poleynes\r\nor knee-kops can be discerned. In the case of the other effigy the\r\nsurcoat is sleeveless and shorter than the other, reaching down to\r\njust over the knees. Poleynes are present, but there are no coudes.\r\nA concave triangular shield hangs by the belt. Chain-mail; quilted\r\nstuffs, often reinforced with rings or studs of iron, bone or horn;\r\nordinarily dressed leather and _cuir-bouilli_, which is leather boiled\r\nor beaten—were all quite capable of resisting an ordinary sword-stroke\r\nor lance-thrust.\r\n\r\nAn effigy of the twelfth century in the Temple Church, London, that\r\nof Geoffrey de Mandeville, Earl of Essex, dating in the year 1144, in\r\nthe reign of Stephen, exhibits the knight completely encased in mail,\r\nwearing a coif of mail of the same fabric, and over it is the tall\r\ncylindrical, flat-topped helm. It was found, however, that certain\r\nvital and more exposed parts of the body required further protection,\r\nfor the mail, far from presenting a glancing surface towards the\r\nstrokes and thrusts from weapons of attack rather afforded them a\r\nlodgment. The mail therefore became gradually reinforced over the\r\nmost vulnerable places with pieces of leather or plates of iron until\r\na full panoply of metal plating had been attained, a process which\r\nhad not been quite completed before the first decade of the fifteenth\r\ncentury. The course of transition can best be followed by a study of\r\nbrasses and effigies. The Crouchback and de Valence effigies show us\r\nthat but little progress in the direction of plate-armour had been made\r\nup to the end of the thirteenth century, though after that time the\r\ntransition became rapid.\r\n\r\nThe usual knightly panoply was a coif of mail and beneath it a cap of\r\ncloth, worn in battle with or sometimes without a surmounting helm; the\r\ntunic; the gambeson or pourpoint, of quilted cloth; the hauberk, of\r\nchain-mail; the chaussons, which covered the upper part of the leg; the\r\nchausses, the lower; and the surcoat.\r\n\r\nChain-mail is probably a fabric of Eastern origin, consisting of forged\r\niron rings, each ring interlinked with four others. This web must\r\nhave been somewhat of a rarity even as late as the eleventh century,\r\nand, indeed, until the process of wire-drawing had been invented,\r\nowing to the laborious and costly nature of its manufacture. Each ring\r\nrequired to be cut from a long strip of wire, hammered-out from the\r\nsolid, then interlinked, riveted, forged or butted together. The Romans\r\nemployed chain-mail, as shown by the compressed masses which have been\r\nfound, but whether it was interlinked in the manner just described is\r\ndoubtful. Hauberks of quilted stuffs, reinforced with rings or studs of\r\niron, bone or horn, were much in use; and so were those of ordinarily\r\ndressed leather; or of _cuir-bouilli_, which is leather prepared by\r\nboiling and beating. All these defences were quite capable of resisting\r\nan ordinary sword-stroke or lance-thrust.\r\n\r\nThe arming of the horse with a bard of chain-mail or its substitutes\r\ndid not take place before the third quarter of the thirteenth century;\r\nthe trapper came into use somewhat earlier, though probably not painted\r\nor embroidered with heraldic bearings before the reign of Edward I.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[21] He began to write the _Annals_ just after the death of Henry II.\r\nin 1189.

They assume various\r\nforms, and were worn upright at the outsides of the shoulders, attached\r\nby laces. On brasses they appear at the backs of the shoulders, but\r\nthis is probably for the reason that the artists found some practical\r\ndifficulty in picturing them so as to appear as they were really worn.\r\nIt is not clear whether these singular pieces were intended for defence\r\nor to be used as planes for the ensignment of heraldic devices; it is\r\ncertain, however, that they could afford but little protection against\r\na stroke from a sword or a battle-axe.\r\n\r\n[48] Aiguillettes, or laces, later termed arming points, played an\r\nimportant part in the arming of a man, and were freely employed in\r\nfastening certain parts of his armour together. These points were also\r\nan important item in civil dress, and were usually of cord, silk, or\r\nleather.\r\n\r\n[49] I, 366.\r\n\r\n[50] XVII, 298.\r\n\r\n[51] Probably a coat-of-fence.\r\n\r\n[52] Cuisses.\r\n\r\n[53] Shoulder-pieces.\r\n\r\n[54] Bascinet.\r\n\r\n[55] Edward, the King’s son; Edmund, the King’s brother; William de\r\nValance, Earl of Pembroke; Gilbert de Clare; and the Earl of Lincoln.\r\nThese five noblemen constituted a court of honour, a committee in fact\r\nfor the control of the tourney. William de Valence died in 1296, so the\r\ndocument must date before that year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fourteenth century was eminently a period of transition and\r\ndevelopment in arms, armour, jousts, tournaments, and, indeed, in\r\neverything that related to warfare. During its course chain-mail\r\nharness had been gradually replaced by iron plate, bit by bit; a\r\nprocess hardly completed at the end. It was a century of almost\r\nincessant fighting among the nations, in the East as well as in the\r\nWest; and the knightly armour of the period in its advancing stages\r\nlies open as a book before us, in a study of our effigies and brasses.\r\n\r\nAn epoch-making detonating force had come into operation, which\r\ninaugurated a new era in the art of war. In its early days ordnance was\r\ngreatly inferior in destructive power to most of the mechanical engines\r\nof the period, but by the end of the century it had developed to an\r\nextent which produced a revolution in the relative resources at command\r\nfor attack and defence; and the old chivalry became at length second in\r\nimportance to the infantry arm.\r\n\r\nContemporary information regarding the jousts and tournaments of the\r\nearlier part of the fourteenth century is sparse; they are described\r\nin the _Romances of Richard Cœur de Lion, Sir Ferumbras_, and others,\r\nwhich teem with improbabilities though still of the greatest value;\r\nand there is a pictorial representation in _Roman du roy Meliadus_ of\r\n“_Une Mêlée de Tornois_”.[56] This romance, probably written about\r\nthe middle of the century, contains several pictorial examples of\r\njousts and tournaments, and a wealth of coloured and gilded drawings\r\non military subjects generally; while others are figured in the\r\nFroissart plates[57], Hefner’s _Tratchten_ and Carter’s _Painting and\r\nSculpture_. It is to Froissart that we are immeasurably most indebted\r\nfor information regarding these martial games, more especially those\r\nof the second half of the fourteenth century, and his recitals contain\r\nmuch invaluable detail, which had been industriously collected from\r\nheralds, pursuivants, kings-of-arms and other officials at the tourney.\r\nFroissart was born about the year 1337, and he began to gather the\r\nmaterial for his history when about twenty years of age, viz. eleven\r\nyears after the battle of Crecy. _The Chronicles_ commence with the\r\ncoronation of Edward III, in 1337, and with the accession of Philip\r\nof Valois to the crown of France, and they close about the end of the\r\ncentury with the death of Richard II of England. At the beginning of\r\nhis career Froissart was closely associated with the English court as\r\na poet and historian, acting, indeed, as clerk to the closet to Queen\r\nPhilippa, after which he entered the Church, becoming later canon\r\nof Chimay. His fine personal gifts soon placed him in excellent and\r\nconfidential relations with many prominent and influential personages,\r\nboth of France and England, able to give him reliable information for\r\nhis history. His industry was remarkable, his style of writing both\r\noriginal and luminous, and his facts and narrations, though often\r\nmarshalled with some confusion, are most reliable, so far at least as\r\nwe can judge now. He was no extreme partisan, but tried, as he often\r\nsays, whenever possible to hear both sides to a question. The weak\r\nplace in his history is his dates and the lack of them. Sainte-Palaye\r\nsays of him: “_Froissart, qui a mieux réussi qu’acun de nos historiens\r\nà peindre les mœurs de son siècle_, ...”\r\n\r\nRoyal jousts were often held in celebration of the coronations and\r\nweddings of princes; and such were usually proclaimed in advance in\r\nother countries of chivalry, so as to afford opportunities for the\r\nattendance of foreign cavaliers anxious to distinguish themselves; and\r\nthese were provided with safe-conducts by the crown.\r\n\r\nIn 1302 “Tournies, iustes, barriers, and other warlike exercises,\r\nwhich yovng lords and gentlemen had appointed to exercise for their\r\npastime in diuerse parts of the realme, were forbidden by the\r\nkings proclamations sent downe to be published by the shirifs in\r\neuerie countie abroad in the realme: the teste of the writ was from\r\nWestminster the sixteenth of Julie.”[58]\r\n\r\nA tournament was proclaimed by the King of Bohemia and the Earl of\r\nHainault, to be held at Condé in 1327, just after the coronation of\r\nEdward III; and Sir John de Hainault, who had been present at the\r\nceremony, left England to attend this tourney, accompanied by fifteen\r\nEnglish knights, who intended taking part.[59]\r\n\r\nHolinshed states that in September, 1330, the King (Ed. III) held\r\njousts in Cheapside, when he with twelve challengers answered all\r\ncomers. The meeting continued over three days, and no serious accidents\r\ntook place.\r\n\r\nA joust of the same year is figured in _Codex Balduini Trevirencis_.\r\nThe cavaliers are seen jousting with lances tipped with coronals\r\nand with flat triangular shields, heraldically ensigned: they wear\r\nample surcoats and the horses are trapped in cloth. The heaumes bear\r\nfan crests, the saddles are without supports; and the object in\r\ncontemplation is the splintering of lances and unhorsing.\r\n\r\n“Great iustes was kept by King Edward at the toune of Dunstable in\r\n1341, with other counterfeited feats of warre, at the request of\r\ndiuerse yovng lords and gentlemen, whereat both the king and queene\r\nwere present, with the more part of the lords and ladies of the\r\nland.”[60]\r\n\r\nKing Edward held a tournament in London in the middle of August, 1342;\r\nand had sent heralds into Flanders, Brabant and France to proclaim\r\nit. Froissart states that the eldest son of Viscount Beaumont[61] was\r\nkilled at this tournament. Other chroniclers date this passage of arms\r\nin 1343.\r\n\r\nTo cry a tourney—“Cy sensuyt la façon des criz de Tournois et des\r\nJoustes. _Cy peut on à prendre à crier et à publier pour ceulx qui\r\nen seront dignes_,” etc. Ashmolean MS., No. 764, 31, 43.[62] On\r\nthe reverse of the last leaf is a picture of a Joust, wherein two\r\ncombatants on horseback, bearing their crests, are fighting with lances\r\nwithin the lists.\r\n\r\nThe Round Table held at Windsor on St. George’s Day in 1344 has been\r\nreferred to in the section devoted to the _Tabula Rotunda_. These\r\nhastiludes and jousts are mentioned by Froissart, who tells us that\r\nthey were characterized by great splendour. The Queen was attended on\r\nthe occasion by three hundred ladies, richly attired; while the King\r\nhad a great array of earls and barons in his train. The “feast” was\r\nnoble, with all good cheer and jousting, and lasted over fifteen days.\r\nHolinshed’s account, under the year 1344, is as follows:—“Moreouer,\r\nabout the beginning of the eighteenth yeare (?) of his reigne, King\r\nEdward held a solemne feast at his castell of Windsore, where betwixt\r\nCandlemasse and Lent, was atchiued manie martiall feasts, and iusts,\r\nand tornaments, and diuerse other the like warlike pastimes, at which\r\nwere present manie strangers of other lands, and in the end thereof,\r\nhe deuised the order of the garter, and after established it, as it\r\nis to this daie. There are six and twentie companions or confrers of\r\nthis felowship of that order, being called knights of the blew garter,\r\nand as one dieth or is depriued, an other is admitted into his place.\r\nThe K. of England is euer chiefe of this order. They weare a blew robe\r\nor mantell, and a garter about their left leg, richlie wrought with\r\ngold and pretious stones, hauing this inscription in French vpon it,\r\nHoni soit qui mal y pense, Shame come to him who euill thinketh. This\r\norder is dedicated to S. George, as chéefe patrone of men of warre, and\r\ntherefor euerie yeare doo the knights of the order kéepe solmne his\r\nfeast, with manie noble ceremonies at the castell of Windsore, where\r\nKing Edward founded a colledge of canons.”[63]\r\n\r\nShortly after this round table the King issued letters patent for\r\nhastiludes and jousts to be held annually at Lincoln, over which the\r\nEarl of Derby was nominated as Captain by the King, the office to be\r\nretained by the earl during life-time, but after his death to become\r\nelective.\r\n\r\nThe “Feast of the Round Table” was again held at Windsor in 1345, and\r\nwithin a few years of it jousts took place at Northampton, Dunstable,\r\nCanterbury, Bury, Reading and Eltham, the exact years of which do not\r\nappear in the wardrobe accounts which have been preserved. In July,\r\n1346, King Edward invaded France, and did not return to London until\r\nOctober, 1347, his home-coming being celebrated by jousts, tournaments,\r\nmasques and other festivities.\r\n\r\nA manuscript covering the expenses of the great wardrobe of Edward\r\nIII from December, 1345, to January, 1349, now in the Public Record\r\nOffice, is printed in _Archæologia_ for the year 1846.[64] Some of\r\nthe items scheduled cover robes for the person, which were delivered\r\nto certain of the knights taking part in a “round-table” held by the\r\nKing at Lichfield in 1348 or 1349, more probably the former year; viz.\r\nfor the King’s person and eleven knights of his chamber, these being\r\nSir Walter Manny, John de L’Isle, Hugo Courtenay, John Gray, Robert de\r\nFerrers, Richard de la Vache, Philip de Spencer, Roger de Beauchamp,\r\nMiles de Stapleton, Ralph de Ferrers and Robert de Mauley. To each of\r\nthese knights two yards of blue cloth for coats and “three quarters\r\nand half a yard” of white cloth for hoods[65] was delivered. Similar\r\ncloth was also issued to some of the other knights. The challengers,\r\nor _tenans_, of the round table consisted of the king and seventeen of\r\nhis knights; their opponents, the _venans_, comprised fourteen knights,\r\nwith the Earl of Lancaster at their head. An entry in the wardrobe\r\naccounts shows that King Edward wore a harness bearing the arms of Sir\r\nThomas Bradeston on the occasion. Any further particulars of this round\r\ntable, beyond the details of the robes for the banquet, are lacking.\r\nThis tournament was celebrated with great pomp and magnificence.\r\n\r\nA spirited verse from Chaucer’s “Knight’s Tale” follows:—[66]\r\n\r\n    “The heraudes lefte hir prikyng up and doun;\r\n     Now ryngen trompès loude and clarioun;\r\n     Ther is namoore to seyn, but west and est\r\n     In goon the speres ful sadly in arrest;\r\n     In gooth the sharpè spore into the syde.\r\n     Ther seen men who kan juste and who kan ryde;\r\n     Ther shyveren shaftès upon sheeldès thikke;\r\n     He feeleth thurgh the hertè-spoon the prikke.\r\n     Up spryngen sperès twenty foot on highte;\r\n     Out gooth the swerdes as the silver brighte;\r\n     The helmès they to-hewen and to-shrede,\r\n     Out brest the blood with stiernè stremès rede;\r\n     With myghty maces the bonès they to-breste.\r\n     He, thurgh the thikkeste of the throng gan threste,\r\n     Ther, stomblen steedès stronge, and doun gooth al;\r\n     He, rolleth under foot as dooth a bal.”\r\n\r\nWe see in the _Romance of Perceforest_ how the ladies at a tournament\r\ntore off pieces of their apparel to be used as tokens or favours by\r\ntheir devoted knights, to an extent leaving them in a condition of\r\ndishabille. A knight often wore “a kerchief of pleasance” on his\r\nhelmet, a token from his lady-love.\r\n\r\nIn 1358 “Roiall iustes were holden in Smithfield, at which were present\r\nthe Kings of England, France and Scotland ... of which the more part of\r\nthe strangers were as their prisoners.”[67]\r\n\r\n“Moreouer, this year (1359) in the Rogation wéeke was solemne iusts\r\nenterprised at London, for the maior and his foure and twentie brethern\r\nas challengers did appoint to ansuer all commers, in whose name and\r\nstéed the King with his foure sonnes, Edward, Lionell, John and Edmund,\r\nand ninetéene other great lords; in secret manner came and held the\r\nfield with honor, to the great pleasure of the citizens that beheld the\r\nsame.”[68]\r\n\r\n“Moreouer this yeare (1362) the fiue first daies of Maie, were kept\r\nroiall iusts in Smithfield by London, the king and queene being\r\npresent, with a great multitude of ladies and gentlemen of both the\r\nrealms of England and France.”[69]\r\n\r\nMuch detailed information concerning the jousting of the fourteenth\r\ncentury has fortunately been preserved in the records of the wars in\r\nFrance, some examples of which follow.\r\n\r\nAt the time when the siege of Tournay was raised by means of a truce, a\r\ntournament was held at Mons, at which Sir Gerard de Verchin, Seneschal\r\nof Hainault, was mortally wounded.[70]\r\n\r\nFroissart states[71] that a combat took place before the walls of the\r\ntown of Rennes in 1357, then being besieged by the English forces,\r\nbetween _a young knight-bachelor_,[72] Bertrand du Guesclin, and\r\nan English cavalier, Sir Nicholas Dagworth. The articles of combat\r\nprovided for three courses with the lance, three strokes with the\r\nbattle-axe and three thrusts with the dagger. These were all duly\r\ndelivered, the knights bearing themselves right gallantly, without hurt\r\nto either of them. The fight was viewed with extreme interest by both\r\narmies.\r\n\r\nSo far Froissart. But there is some doubt whether it was Sir Nicholas\r\nDagworth who was one of the principals in this duel; for in the\r\n_Histoire de Bretagne_ it is stated that it was William de Blanchbourg,\r\nbrother of the Governor of Fougerai, who was Sir Bertrand’s opponent\r\non the occasion, and that he was wounded and unhorsed. It is more\r\nprobable, however, that both duels were fought, though the last-named\r\ncombat was not likely to have taken place under the walls of Rennes,\r\nfor both cavaliers were Frenchmen.\r\n\r\nThere is a singularly beautiful brass in the pavement of the south\r\nchapel of Blickling Church, Norfolk, in memory of Sir Nicholas\r\nDagworth, who was a man of importance in the reigns of kings Edward III\r\nand Richard II. He lived until the year 1401,[73] and his will appears\r\nin _Testamenta Vetusta_. The brass is given in the Boutell Collection.\r\nIt affords an excellent example of the armour prevailing at the end\r\nof the fourteenth century, when the evolution from chain-mail to full\r\nplate-armour had been almost completed. The helmet is the pointed\r\nbascinet, with the camail, the latter with an ornamental bordering\r\ncoming over the top of the jupon. The cyclas, which has an enriched\r\nfringing, hides the body-armour from view, and the knightly belt is\r\nelaborately decorated; the pouldrons are articulated. The gauntlets,\r\nwith short cuffs, have gads over the fingers for use in the _mêlée_,\r\nand they show an imitation of finger-nails, and the solerets are freely\r\narticulated. The knight’s head rests on his great helm, which has a\r\nmantling; and a wreath, surmounted by the crest, a griffin. The armour\r\nis enriched with chasing. The Arms—Erm, on a fesse, gu., three bezants:\r\nimpaling Rosale, Cu., a fesse between six martlet’s or.\r\n\r\nThe armour of the Black Prince in the Chapel of the Holy Trinity, at\r\nCanterbury Cathedral, affords an excellent illustration of the degree\r\nof progress reached in the last quarter of the fourteenth century. The\r\nprocess of evolution from chain-mail to plate is here almost completed,\r\nthere being only small pieces of the former at the skirt, arms and\r\ninsteps of the solerets. The Prince died in 1376, and the date of his\r\neffigy is somewhat later.\r\n\r\nDuring a skirmish at Toury, in France, shortly before the death of\r\nKing Charles V, in 1380, an esquire of Beauce, named Gauvain Micaille,\r\nenquired through an herald if any English gentleman would be willing\r\nto try a feat of arms with him—a joust of three courses, and the\r\nexchange of three blows with the battle-axe and of three thrusts with\r\nthe dagger. The challenge was accepted by an English esquire, named\r\nJoachim Cator. The Frenchman received a severe wound in the thigh in\r\nthe jousting, which was in contravention of the rules of the tourney;\r\nbut the Englishman pleaded that it was an accident solely due to the\r\nrestiveness of his horse; and this explanation was accepted by the\r\numpire.[74]\r\n\r\nAn interesting tournament took place at Cambray in 1385 on the marriage\r\nof the Count d’Ostrevant to the daughter of Duke Philip of Burgundy.\r\nThe ceremony was followed by a banquet at which the King of France\r\nwas present as well as the Duke. The tournament was held in the\r\nmarket-place of the town, and forty knights took part, the King tilting\r\nwith a knight of Hainault. The prize was a clasp of precious stones,\r\ntaken from off the bosom of the Duchess of Burgundy; it was won by a\r\nknight of Hainault, Sir John Destrenne, and was formally presented by\r\nthe Admiral of France and Sir Guy de la Trimouille.[75]\r\n\r\nThe number of courses run in jousting and the blows and strokes\r\nexchanged with battle-axes, swords and daggers at a meeting like that\r\njust described was usually three each; but they tended to increase as\r\nthe century advanced, and five got to be a common number, and later as\r\nmany as ten or even twelve. In the duel between Sir Thomas Harpenden\r\nand Messire Jean des Barres, at Montereau sur Yonne in 1387, they\r\nnumbered “_cinq lances à cheval, cinq coups d’épée, cinq coups de dague\r\net cinq coups de hache_.” The first four courses of the jousts were run\r\nwith equal fortune, but in the fifth Sir Thomas was unhorsed and lay\r\nsenseless on the ground; he revived, however, after a time, and all the\r\nstrokes and blows were duly exchanged without further hurt to either\r\nknight. The King of France was present on the occasion.[76]\r\n\r\nAbout this time, when the war between France and England was in full\r\nprogress, there was much jousting with pointed lances between the\r\nknights and esquires of the two nations; safe-conducts being issued by\r\nthe commanders on either side.\r\n\r\nA meeting was arranged to take place near Nantes, under the auspices of\r\nthe Constable of France and the Earl of Buckingham. The first encounter\r\nwas a combat on foot, with sharp spears, in which one of the cavaliers\r\nwas slightly wounded; the pair then ran three courses with the lance\r\nwithout further mishap. Next Sir John Ambreticourt of Hainault and Sir\r\nTristram de la Jaille of Poitou advanced from the ranks and jousted\r\nthree courses, without hurt. A duel followed between Edward Beauchamp,\r\nson of Sir Robert Beauchamp, and the bastard Clarius de Savoye. Clarius\r\nwas much the stronger man of the two, and Beauchamp was unhorsed. The\r\nbastard then offered to fight another English champion, and an esquire\r\nnamed Jannequin Finchly came forward in answer to the call; the combat\r\nwith swords and lances was very violent, but neither of the parties\r\nwas hurt. Another encounter took place between John de Châtelmorant\r\nand Jannequin Clinton, in which the Englishman was unhorsed. Finally\r\nChâtelmorant fought with Sir William Farrington, the former receiving\r\na dangerous wound in the thigh, for which the Englishman was greatly\r\nblamed, as being an infraction of the rules of the tourney; but an\r\naccident was pleaded as in the case of the duel between Gauvain\r\nMicaille and Joachim Cator. At this meeting the honours lay with the\r\nFrenchmen.[77]\r\n\r\nSomewhat later a combat _à outrance_[78] took place at Chateau\r\nJosselin, near Vannes, between John Boucmel, a Frenchman, and Nicholas\r\nClifford, in which Boucmel was struck on the upper part of the\r\nbreastplate by his opponent’s lance, which, glancing off, entered\r\nhis neck through the camail and severed the jugular vein, killing\r\nhim instantly.[79] A plate of Froissart’s represents this duel as a\r\ncombat on foot with long lances, taking place in a small quadrangular\r\nenclosure.\r\n\r\nJuvenal des Ursins states[80] that at the marriage of Charles VI, of\r\nFrance, with Isabel (Isabeau) of Bavaria, 1385, jousts and grand fêtes\r\ntook place in its honour. Sir Peter Courtenay came to France at the\r\ntime with the object of accomplishing a feat of arms with the Seigneur\r\nde la Tremouille. The King’s consent to the duel had been obtained,\r\nand the day and place were fixed for its accomplishment. The knights\r\nappeared in the lists on the day appointed in order to fulfil their\r\nengagement in presence of the King, who, however, at the last moment,\r\nowing to some remonstrances, forbade the combat: but a duel did take\r\nplace at the time between an English knight and the Seigneur de Clery,\r\nin which the Englishman was wounded and unhorsed. This joust had been\r\nbrought to the notice of the Duke of Burgundy, who said that the\r\noffence committed by a Frenchman in jousting with an enemy without the\r\nconsent of his sovereign was worthy of death; his Majesty, however, at\r\nlength pardoned the offender.\r\n\r\nFroissart describes a realistic tournament, held at Paris during the\r\nwedding festivities, as between the Saracens under Saladin, and the\r\nCrusaders, led by Richard Cœur de Lion.\r\n\r\nThe feat of arms between Sir John Holland and Sir Reginald de Roye, a\r\nFrench chevalier of distinction, held at the town of Entença, before\r\nthe King and Queen of Portugal and the Duke and Duchess of Lancaster,\r\npresents features of its own. The French knight sent an invitation to\r\nthe Englishman entreating him to joust with him three courses with the\r\nlance, and to exchange the same number of strokes with the battle-axe,\r\nsword and dagger, for the love of his lady. The challenge was promptly\r\naccepted, and an answer returned by the herald, together with a\r\nsafe-conduct for the Frenchman and his company. Sir Reginald arrived in\r\ndue time at Entença, handsomely accompanied by six score knights and\r\nesquires. The meeting was held in a spacious close in the town, the\r\nground well strewn with sand; and galleries had been erected for the\r\naccommodation of the royal and ducal parties, with other spectators.\r\nThe jousting was to be with sharp lances, to be followed by a contest\r\nwith sharp and well-tempered battle-axes, swords and daggers. The\r\nchampions were well mounted and rode into the lists in full armour,\r\ntaking up positions for their careers at either end of the lists, with\r\nthe distance of a bow-shot between them. The signal for the onset\r\nhaving been sounded, the knights charged each other at the gallop, and\r\nSir Reginald struck the bars of his opponent’s visor so stoutly that\r\nhis lance splintered on impact. Sir John Holland also struck the visor\r\nof his adversary well and fairly, but the helmet of the Frenchman,\r\ninstead of having been securely laced to his body-armour as was usual,\r\nwas only held by a single thong, and of course slipped off, leaving the\r\nknight bare-headed and Sir John’s lance unbroken. The jousters then\r\nreturned to their stations, and charged each other as before, and again\r\nthe same thing happened, owing to the same cause. The English who were\r\npresent regarded the unusual loose fastening of the helmet as a trick,\r\nbut the umpire, the Duke of Lancaster, ruled that it was admissible\r\nfor Sir John Holland to have employed the same artifice had he chosen\r\nto do so, and that therefore he could not decide against the French\r\nknight.[81] After the stipulated three courses with the lance had been\r\nrun, the knights fought three rounds each with battle-axes swords and\r\ndaggers, without either receiving a scratch. The French chevalier was\r\nadjudged to have had the advantage, though both had done well.[82]\r\n\r\nIn 1389 a deed of arms was performed at Bordeaux before the Duke of\r\nLancaster, between five Englishmen and five Frenchmen: three courses\r\nwith the lance, three courses with swords, and the same number with\r\nbattle-axes. None was wounded, but one of the English knights killed\r\nthe horse of a Frenchman with his lance, which greatly angered the\r\nDuke, who replaced the loss with one of his own chargers.[83]\r\n\r\nThe most prominent and accomplished jouster of his day was the\r\nChevalier Jean Le Maingre, called De Boucicaut, Mareschal of France\r\n1368-1421, and his _Mémoires_,[84] by an unknown author, contain\r\ndescriptions of some of his exploits in the tiltyard. One of these\r\nrecitals[85] follows:—During the three years’ truce between France\r\nand England, when King Charles VI was at Montpellier,[86] the French\r\nSeigneurs De Boucicaut, de Sampi and de Roye challenged all comers,\r\nbeing foreign knights and esquires, to joust five courses with\r\nlances, pointed or blunted, at their pleasure, at St. Ingelbert,[87]\r\na place near Calais; the _pas d’armes_ (or the “_table-ronde_,” as\r\nit is called in the _Chapitres d’Armes_, or articles of combat) to\r\ncontinue for thirty days. A great elm stood before the pavilions\r\nof the challengers, and hanging from its branches were two shields\r\nof wood, one of them plated with iron, “_l’un de paix, l’autre de\r\nguerre_,” so that each venant on arriving at the rendezvous could\r\nsignify his pleasure as to whether he elected to fight with pointed\r\nor rebated lances by striking with a wand the shield for peace or\r\nthat for war. The arms and devices of the three tenans were painted\r\nabove the two shields, so that each venant might be able to select\r\nhis adversary among them, and a note blown on a horn proclaimed his\r\nchoice. Each venant was to furnish the king of arms with his name and\r\ntitles, and to bring another cavalier with him as his sponsor. The\r\nlists were richly decorated, the challengers handsomely apparelled;\r\nand lavish hospitality was dispensed in a pavilion specially pitched\r\nfor the purpose. Any arms, armour, or other requisites of which the\r\nvenans might stand in need, were freely provided, the motto everywhere\r\ndisplayed being “Ce que vouldrez.” The chronicle goes on to state that\r\non the first day of the jousting, Jean de Holland, Earl of Huntingdon,\r\nhalf-brother to King Richard, signified his intention of jousting with\r\nBoucicaut. Both lances were fairly splintered in the first encounter,\r\nthe second and third being fought with equal fortune; but in the fourth\r\nthe horse of the English knight fell with its rider, who was severely\r\ninjured, his antagonist only retaining his seat by the prompt support\r\nof his varlets. Boucicaut then retired to his pavilion, but was not\r\nallowed to remain resting for long, for other English cavaliers desired\r\nto joust with him, and he disposed of two other knights the same day.\r\nWhile he was engaged in combat day after day, his fellow tenans were\r\nnot idle, and the thirty days stipulated in the _Chapitres d’Armes_ ran\r\ntheir course. Among other cavaliers from England taking part were Earl\r\nMarschal, the knights de Beaumont, Thomas de Perci, de Clifford and\r\nCourtenay, besides Sir John d’Ambreticourt and many Spanish and German\r\ncavaliers. Boucicaut is said to have gone through the whole thirty days\r\nof jousting without a scratch.\r\n\r\nThe rôle of the tenans at a _pas d’armes_ was no sinecure, and for\r\nthree knights to have held the _pas_ for thirty days against all\r\ncomers, as in this case, must have been an arduous undertaking; and\r\nvery dangerous also, more especially as much of the jousting was with\r\npointed lances. No. XI of Froissart’s plates professes to depict one\r\nof the jousts of this _pas d’armes_; but it pictures one at the tilt,\r\nso that the drawing is obviously of a later date than that of the\r\nInglevert meeting, and was, in fact, executed in the reign of Edward\r\nIV, when the tilt was in common use. Froissart[88] gives a long and\r\ncircumstantial account of this meeting, and states that it was very\r\nrichly appointed. King Charles of France was present incognito, and had\r\nsubscribed very handsomely towards the heavy expenses incurred.\r\n\r\nMonkish chronicles, written in times not contemporaneous with the\r\nevents they describe, are usually unreliable in being coloured with\r\nthe circumstances of a later age; and any illuminations or wood-cuts\r\naccompanying them are apt to reflect the times in which they were\r\nexecuted, rather than those they are represented to portray, for the\r\nartist fills in his picture with the details of the scenes before him.\r\nHowever, with the accumulated knowledge we now possess, we are enabled\r\nto correct some of the mistakes, from a chronological point of view.\r\n\r\nA royal tournament was held in London by King Richard II, immediately\r\nafter the Michaelmas of the year 1390, in honour of Queen Isabella;\r\nand heralds were sent to proclaim it throughout England, Scotland,\r\nHainault, Germany, Flanders and France. Sixty knights were to joust\r\nwith rebated lances, as tenans, for two successive days, the Sunday and\r\nMonday, against all comers; and the Tuesday following was set apart for\r\nthe esquires. The jousting was to be followed by banquets, dances and\r\nsumptuous fêtes and entertainments of various kinds. The prizes for\r\nthe Sunday were as follows:—A rich crown of gold for the best lance\r\namong the venans; and, for the most successful among the tenans, a\r\nvery rich golden clasp. Those for the Monday are not stated; but for\r\nthe Tuesday, the esquires’ day, they were a handsome charger, fully\r\naccoutred, and a falcon, for the best lances of the venans and tenans,\r\nrespectively. The ladies were to act as judges and to present them. The\r\nSunday’s jousting was called the feast of the challengers. At three\r\np.m. the procession started from the Tower of London. Sixty barded\r\nchargers, an esquire mounted on each, advanced at a foot’s pace; then\r\nsixty ladies of rank richly apparelled and mounted on palfreys, rode in\r\nsingle file, each leading a knight, in full armour, by a silver chain.\r\nThe procession thus formed proceeded along the streets of London, down\r\nCheapside to Smithfield, attended by minstrels and trumpeters. The King\r\nand Queen, with their suites, accompanied by some of the great barons,\r\nhad gone earlier to Smithfield, and there awaited the arrival of the\r\nprocession and the knights from abroad. Their Majesties were lodged in\r\nthe Bishop’s palace, and there the banquets and dances were to be held.\r\nMany foreign knights and esquires attended, and among them Sir William\r\nof Hainault (Count d’Ostrevant)[89] and the Count de St. Pol.\r\n\r\nOn the arrival of the procession at Smithfield the knights mounted\r\ntheir horses and prepared for jousting, which began soon after. The\r\nprize for the best lance of the venans on the Sunday, the first day\r\nof jousting, was awarded by the ladies to the Count de St. Pol; and\r\nthat for the most skilful knight among the tenans, to the Earl of\r\nHuntingdon.[90] The King led the tenans on the Monday; and the prize\r\nfor the best lance of the venans was awarded to the Count d’Ostrevant;\r\nthat for the most successful of their opponents to Sir Hugh Spencer.\r\nThe esquires jousted on the Tuesday, after which there was a banquet,\r\nand dancing was continued until daybreak. There was jousting on the\r\nWednesday for knights and esquires indiscriminately; and on Thursday\r\nand Friday fêtes, masques and banquets, after which the royal party\r\nleft for Windsor.[91]\r\n\r\nCaxton refers to these royal jousts in the following terms:—\r\n\r\n“All of the King’s hous were of one sute, theyr cotys, theyr armys,\r\ntheyr sheldes and theyr trappours were embrowdred all with whyte\r\nhertis, with crownes of gold about their necks, and cheynes of gold\r\nhangyng thereon; whiche hertys were the King’s leverey, that he gaf to\r\nlordes, ladyes, knyghtes, ＆ squyers, to know his houshold peple from\r\nother; then four and twenty ladyes comynge to the justys, ladde[92]\r\nfour and twenty lordes with chynes of gold, and alle in the same sute\r\nof hertes as is afore sayd, from the Tour on horsback thrurgh the\r\ncyte of London into Smythfeld.” The narrative of this tournament by\r\nHolinshed[93] is far from being so picturesque as that of Froissart,\r\nand it differs in some particulars from it. He says there were\r\ntwenty-four ladies, not sixty, mounted on palfreys; and that the prizes\r\nfor the first day were awarded to the Comte de St. Pol and the Earl of\r\nHuntingdon; and on the Monday to the Earl of Ostravant and Sir Hugh\r\nSpencer.\r\n\r\nKing Richard proclaimed another grand tournament to be held at Windsor\r\nin one of the closing years of his reign; the tenans or challengers\r\nto be forty knights and forty esquires, clothed in green. The Queen\r\nwas present, but very few of the barons attended, owing to the great\r\nunpopularity and arbitrary actions of the King,[94] whose reign had\r\nbegun under the happiest auspices, but the manifest defects in his\r\ncharacter brought his career to a sorrowful ending.\r\n\r\nThere was a kind of tourney called the _Espinette_ held at Lille, in\r\nhonour of a relic preserved there, which, though obscure, would seem to\r\nhave been but an ordinary joust with which certain annual ceremonies\r\nwere connected. Hewitt[95] quotes the _Chronicle of Flanders_\r\nconcerning a celebration in the year 1339:—“Jehan Bernier went to joust\r\nat the _Espinette_, taking with him four damsels, namely, the wife\r\nof Seigneur Jehan Biensemé, the wife of Symon du Gardin, the wife of\r\nMonseigneur Amoury de la Vingne, and mademoiselle his own wife. And\r\nthe said Jehan Bernier was led into the lists by two of the aforesaid\r\ndamsels by two golden cords, the other two carrying each a lance. And\r\nthe King of the _Espinette_ this year was Pierre de Courtray, who bore\r\nSable, three golden Eagles with two heads and red beaks and feet.” M.\r\nLeber gives some account of the _fête de l’épinette_ in the _Collection\r\ndes traités_.\r\n\r\nThe vamplate, _avant-plate_, placed on the shaft of the lance, for the\r\nprotection of the right hand and arm, first appears in the fourteenth\r\ncentury; and so does the lance-rest on the breastplate. An ordinance\r\nof the thirteenth century orders the lance to be blunted for the\r\ntourney; but in the fourteenth it was ordered to be tipped with a\r\ncoronal, the short points of which were just sufficient to catch on\r\nto the armour without being capable of piercing it. The helmet of the\r\nfourteenth century was the pointed bascinet, with the camail or hood\r\nof mail worn over the top of the cyclas. The great heaume used early\r\nin the fourteenth century differs little from that of the end of the\r\nthirteenth; later it assumed the form of a cylinder, surmounted by a\r\ntruncated cone. It was usually of iron, though sometimes of leather,\r\neither ordinary or of _cuir-bouilli_. The fan crest, doubtless adopted\r\nfrom a classic prototype, came into vogue in the last quarter of the\r\nthirteenth century, though it is represented on the seal of King\r\nRichard I.\r\n\r\nCrests were made of various materials. Those for the cavaliers taking\r\npart in the tournament at Windsor Park, in 1278, were of calf-skin,\r\none for the man and another for the horse, as shown in the Roll of\r\nPurchases; that of the Black Prince, at Canterbury,[96] was of cloth.\r\nThey were attached to the helm by means of a thin iron bar. Crests\r\nwere usually affixed to the great helm, which was worn over the\r\nbascinet; though there are instances of their being used alone on the\r\nsmaller head-piece.\r\n\r\nThe heraldic crest does not appear before towards the close of the\r\nthirteenth century; a notable instance may be cited in the case of\r\nthe remarkable effigy of Sir John de Botiler, in St. Bride’s Church,\r\nGlamorganshire, which dates about the year 1300. The helmet of this\r\nmonument is the cervellière, which is a visor-less, saucer or shallow\r\nbasin-shaped head-piece, going over the hood of mail; and the crest\r\nis embossed on its front. Crests were not generally worn before about\r\nthe end of the first quarter of the fourteenth century, after which\r\nperiod they develop from comparative simplicity into fantastic and even\r\nridiculous conceptions.\r\n\r\nA strange fancy was the cap-of-maintenance, the placing of a cap of\r\nvelvet or other material on the helm, surmounted by the family crest;\r\nand in the second half of the century or a little later the orle or\r\nwreath and mantling or lambrequin are added.\r\n\r\nThe shield of the century was of the triangular kite or heater-shaped\r\nform.\r\n\r\nIn 1390 “John de Hastings earle of Pembroke, as he was practising to\r\nlearne to ioust, thrugh mishap was striken about the priuie parts, by a\r\nknight called Sir John S. John, that ran against him, so as his inner\r\nparts being perished, death presentlie followed.”[97]\r\n\r\nIn 1398 the Earl of Crawford, of Scotland, jousted _à outrance_, i.e.\r\nwith sharp lances, with Lord Wells of England at London Bridge, the\r\n23rd April, being the feast day of St. George. An attaint was made in\r\nthe first course, and both champions kept their seats. The Earl sat\r\nso steadfast in his saddle under the shock that the by-standers cried\r\nout that he was locked to his seat, on hearing which he jumped off his\r\nhorse and then vaulted back into his saddle again with such agility as\r\ngreatly to astonish the people. In the second course they met again\r\nas before without either being hurt; but in the third Lord Wells “was\r\nborne out of the saddle and sore hurt with a grieuous fall.”\r\n\r\nNot long after a duel on horseback took place in Scotland between\r\nSir Robert Morley, an Englishman, and Sir Archibald Edmounston, and\r\nafterwards with another Scot Hugh Wallace, and the first-named was the\r\nvictor in both cases; but he was at length overcome by one Hugh Traill,\r\nat Berwick, and died shortly after from chagrin.[98]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[56] British Museum.

An oath to observe the rules of chivalry\r\nwas administered to all cavaliers taking part in the tournament.\r\n\r\nBody-armour had proved inadequate to resist the then weapons of attack,\r\nand at the commencement of the century, or perhaps a couple of decades\r\nearlier, the armour-smith was especially directing his attention\r\ntowards the strengthening of the knightly harness. The chief seat of\r\nthe industry for the greater part of the century was at Milan, at which\r\ncity armour was forged of such strength as to be capable of resisting\r\nthrusts with the lance and strokes from the terrible battle-axe, sword\r\nand mace practically without fracture; and one meets with references in\r\nEnglish and other records to orders being sent to Milan for harnesses\r\nof proof, a civil garment being forwarded to indicate the stature and\r\nbuild of the person, since ill-fitting suits would be apt to chafe the\r\nwearers. But, while the best and most costly harnesses came from Italy,\r\nless expensive equipments were imported into England from Germany;\r\nfor “_ostling_” (Easterling) armour is sometimes mentioned in English\r\narticles of combat, and it was probably obtained through the agency of\r\nthe Hanseatic Confederation from their London depôt, the Steelyard,\r\nthen situated in what is now Lower Thames Street, London. The cost of\r\ncarriage also would be much less from Germany.\r\n\r\nThe great armour-smiths of Milan at the period immediately under review\r\nwere members of the Missaglia Negroli family, which, like many others,\r\ncarried on their craft for several generations. The Germans have always\r\nbeen wont to borrow the inventions and processes of other nations,\r\nand then often to cheapen them; and so it was with body-armour. They\r\ngradually succeeded, under the personal inspiration and direction of\r\nthe Emperor Maximilian, in transferring the bulk of that industry, even\r\nin the best harnesses, to German soil, until at length cities like\r\nNuremberg and Augsburg became the chief seats of the manufacture; and\r\nindeed the bulk of the armours preserved to us of the later “Gothic”\r\nand “Maximilian” styles are of German make. That Maximilian engaged\r\narmour-smiths from Italy is seen by a contract made in 1494[99] with\r\nthe Milan armourers Gabrielle and Francesco de Merate, to erect and\r\nequip for him a smithy in the town of Arbois, in Burgundy, to forge\r\nthere a certain number of harnesses at fixed prices. The armour worn\r\nby Maximilian I at Worms, in 1495, in a combat on foot with the\r\nBurgundian, Claude de Vaudrey, bears the stamp “m,e,r,” surmounted by\r\na crown, the Milan mark of these smiths, who came next in celebrity to\r\nthe Missaglias.\r\n\r\nMany ameliorations were conceived in the fifteenth century with a view\r\nto further minimizing the risk of serious accidents, and one of the\r\nmost far-reaching and important was the application of the tilt in\r\njousting. Many injuries had befallen the riders in the tourney by the\r\ncollision of their horses, sometimes by accident, at others by design,\r\nand the idea of the tilt was conceived greatly with a view towards\r\nobviating this danger. The tilt, or _toile_, was at first a rope hung\r\nwith cloth, stretched along the middle of the lists, but later it\r\nbecame a barrier of planks, along which the tilters charged in opposite\r\ndirections, their bridle-arms towards it, their lances held in rest in\r\ntheir right hands on the tilt side of the horse’s neck, striking the\r\npolished, glancing surface of their adversary’s armour at an angle. The\r\ntilt had the advantage of lending a fixed direction to the jousters in\r\ntheir careers, though they often failed to touch each other. With the\r\ndanger of these collisions removed, the knight ran his course with but\r\nlittle risk.\r\n\r\nJousting in the open with pointed lances was, however, continued\r\nby a hardier type of jousters until long after the introduction of\r\nthe tilt; and here the saddle was without cantle, so as to offer no\r\nimpediment to unhorsing; and a cushion or mattress, stuffed with straw,\r\nwas placed over the chests of the horses, to act as a buffer in case\r\nof collision. A rough game it was for a cavalier to be unseated and\r\nthrown to the ground in his heavy armour, sometimes carrying a weight\r\nof two hundred pounds; though his fall was broken by the ground of the\r\nlists being covered with thickly strewn sand or mulched with refuse\r\nfrom the tan-yard. This form was much practised in Germany, though\r\nstrange to say but little harm would seem to have been experienced by\r\nthe champions in their falls, greatly owing to the extensive padding\r\nof their harnesses. Other important departures in the direction of\r\ncomparative safety were the designing of special forms of armour for\r\nthe tiltyard, and the introduction of additional or reinforcing pieces,\r\nfor doubly protecting those parts of the body on which the brunt of the\r\nattack fell, viz. mainly on the left side. They first appear in England\r\nin the reign of Edward IV. “William Lord Bergavenny bequeathed to his\r\nson the best sword and harness for justs of peace and that which belong\r\nto war.”\r\n\r\nThe vamplate of this century was much enlarged, for the protection of\r\nthe lance-arm; and the steels of the saddles lent great protection to\r\nthe bodies of the jousters below the breast. The effect of all this was\r\nto encase those taking part in the tourney in an almost impenetrable\r\nshell, from which they could barely see or do more than couch and aim\r\ntheir lances.\r\n\r\nArmour for the lists became sharply divided from that employed for\r\n“hoasting” purposes, as harnesses for the field were called, though in\r\nwhat country the change had its origin, whether in Burgundy, Italy or\r\nGermany, is uncertain. It was in use in Burgundy in the year 1443, for\r\nwe read in the account given in _Mémoires D’Olivier De La Marche_,[100]\r\nthat during the time the necessary preparations were being made for\r\nthe tournament held at L’Arbre de Charlemagne, Dijon, in that year,\r\nthe young cavaliers practised jousting before the duke “_et là furent\r\nfaictes une jouste à selles plattes et en harnois de joûte_.”\r\n\r\nHarnesses for the lists assume different forms in Germany from those\r\nin Italy. In the first-named country in the case of the armour for\r\njousting in the open, so to speak, the breastplate was flattened on\r\nthe right side for better couching and aiming the lance, which was\r\nsupported by a _Rasthaken_ or queue behind, as well as by a lance-rest\r\nin front, while in Italy the cuirass continued rounded in form. The\r\nlance-rest (_Rüsthaken_) assumed various forms, though usually that of\r\na curved bracket. Reinforcing pieces were employed in all courses.\r\n\r\nThere is another variety of armour which was used in\r\n_Scharfrennen_,[101] but it, with the others, will be particularly\r\ndescribed and illustrated later on. Jousting at the tilt prevailed\r\ngreatly in England, though abroad many other varieties were practised\r\nas well. Jousting lances were often painted or ornamented with\r\nparty-coloured puffs of cloth along their length. Lance-heads assumed\r\nvarious forms, examples of which may be seen in several of the German\r\nmuseums and in the Tower of London. Illustrations are given by\r\nBoeheim.[102] The shafts varied in form, weight and thickness for the\r\ndifferent courses.\r\n\r\nThe armour for combats on foot was made very strong and heavy, and so\r\npadded with under-clothing as to cause faintings and even deaths in\r\nhot weather. Foot-fighting was rendered much safer by the introduction\r\nof “barriers,” over which the champions fought, but they do not appear\r\nmuch before the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe physical strain on those taking part in a tournament must have been\r\ngreat, and the combatants weary at the end of a long day; nevertheless\r\nthey joined the ladies in the evening, when the successful competitors\r\nreceived the prizes from their hands; and after the banquet came the\r\ndance.\r\n\r\nThe century saw the mingling of the tourney with the pageant; the\r\n_mêlée_ had been much supplanted by the joust, which demanded more\r\nindividual skill, for in the throng and confusion of the _mêlée_ the\r\nelement of chance helped certain of the combatants to a distinction\r\nbeyond their real deserts; while in the joust, which was a contest\r\nbetween two champions only, each had to stand or fall solely on his own\r\nmerits.\r\n\r\nA favourite form of the tourney of the fifteenth century was the\r\n_Kolbenturnier_ or baston course, which differed essentially from all\r\nthe others in that no personal injury was intended in the contest,\r\nthe object being to batter off the crest which decorated the helm of\r\nan adversary; and it was thus purely a game or trial of skill. The\r\nweapon employed was a _Kolben_, a heavy polygonally-cut baston or mace\r\nof hard wood, about 80 cm. in length. The _Kolben_ swells out along\r\nits shaft to an obtuse point, has a round pommel, short grip, and a\r\nrondel-guard of iron. There is an illustration of this weapon in the\r\n_Tourney-book of René d’Anjou_. The helm, a huge, globose form of\r\nbascinet, was latticed over the face with strong iron bars, and screwed\r\nto the cuirass back and front; it was thickly lined inside and roomy\r\nenough to prevent any injury which might be caused by the heavy blows\r\nexchanged. It was covered outside with leather and painted with various\r\ndevices. A fine example of this type of helm is at Dresden, and Boeheim\r\nin _Waffenkunde_,[103] figures one of them in the Collection Mayerfisch\r\nat Sigmaringen. The saddle was the high one, known as the _Sattel im\r\nhohen Zeug_; an example, of the second half of the fifteenth century,\r\nis in the Germanische National Museum at Nuremburg. The _Kolbenturnier_\r\nceased being run about the end of the first quarter of the sixteenth\r\ncentury. It was at first practised on foot, and doubtless grew out of\r\nthe Judicial combats with the baston of the lower classes. Boeheim\r\nin _Waffenkunde_[104] illustrates Duke Georg of Bayern-Zandshut, at\r\nHeidelberg, armed for a _Kolbenturnier_ in 1482: from Hans Burgmaior’s\r\n_Turnierbuch_, in possession of the Prince of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen.\r\n\r\nThe crests of the fifteenth century are most fanciful and fantastic,\r\nsuch as a crowned unicorn or the tail of a fox; many examples may be\r\nseen in the tourney-book of King René, the Beauchamp pageants, the\r\nGerman tourney books, and other works of the kind; and René describes\r\ntheir construction very fully. They are fragile and made greatly of\r\nthe same materials as those of the century preceding, though oftener\r\nof _cuir-bouilli_, which substance was more substantial and enduring.\r\nThe tapestry at Valenciennes, which pictures a _mêlée_ of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, shows numerous fragments of crests lying on the ground under\r\nthe hoofs of the horses. The knights prized their crests greatly; and\r\nthey were often buried with them. They were fixed in position by an\r\niron bar or brooch; an example of the latter may be seen at the Musée\r\nd’Artillerie, Paris. Sometimes the horse was also provided with a\r\ncrest, as in the tournament at Windsor Park in 1278.\r\n\r\nThe hours during which _fêtes d’armes_ took place show that the\r\nlists were frequently artificially lighted, and, indeed, torches and\r\nflambeaux are sometimes mentioned.\r\n\r\nTournaments held at the royal and princely courts of the countries\r\nof chivalry were strictly games, the hosts often challenging their\r\nguests to trials of skill; and some correspondence preserved of the\r\nfifteenth and sixteenth centuries, between German princes, shows what\r\na great part these martial sports played in the routine of their daily\r\nlives; second only, if even that, to the chase. Kurfürst Albrecht von\r\nBrandenburg, writing to a friend in the last quarter of the century,\r\nsays:—“_Wir sind yor mit gots hilff die fordersten im Turnier gewesen\r\nund gedenkens aber zu bleiben_.”[105] Maximilian, writing, at the age\r\nof nineteen, to Sigmund Pruschenk, remarks:—“_Ich hab das pest gethan,\r\nwann ich hab VIII stechholz zerstossen_.”[106]\r\n\r\nMuch depended on the docility and training of the chargers, which\r\nwere often ridden blindfolded, and they were sometimes influenced by\r\na spirit of combat like their riders. The bodies of the horses were\r\npadded and covered by the trapper, which fell down almost to the\r\nground, considerably hampering their motions; a mattress of straw,\r\ncrescent-formed, protected their chests;[107] their ears were sometimes\r\nstopped with wool or oakum; the head and tail frequently decorated with\r\nfeathers; and the animals advanced towards each other at a hand-gallop.\r\nThe rowel-spurs had long necks. Each variety of joust had its own\r\nspecial type of saddle, devised with the object of making unhorsing\r\neither difficult or easy as the case might be. These saddles will\r\nbe described in their order. Each prince or man of rank and fortune\r\nkept a considerable number of horses continually in practice; and the\r\ncorrespondence of the times reveals many requests for their loan.\r\n\r\nIt was at the courts of Aix and Burgundy where for long the tourney\r\nwas much fostered; and at both it may be said to have been reduced\r\nalmost to a science. At the first-named court it was much a matter of\r\namusement, emulation and relaxation; while in the latter, then the most\r\nbrilliant in Europe, it was greatly the policy of the sovereign to\r\nencourage tournaments and fêtes of all kinds. They kept the leaders of\r\nthe armies and the chevaliers generally in close touch with the head of\r\nthe state and the country, besides providing gladiatorial spectacles\r\nfor the duke’s somewhat restless and discontented subjects, who were\r\noften smarting under heavy imposts to provide him with the means for\r\nconstant schemes of aggression and a profuse display, and who were\r\nfrequently in a state of revolt. After the tragic death of Charles the\r\nBold, the jousting traditions of the court of Burgundy passed over to\r\nthat of Maximilian of Austria, who would seem to have made successful\r\njousting one of the great objects of his life.\r\n\r\nThere is perhaps necessarily a certain degree of monotony and\r\nrepetition in the narrations of the chroniclers of the joust and\r\ntourney, but they convey collectively a much clearer idea of these\r\nencounters than a mere bald statement of the leading facts could do,\r\nand they reflect the chivalrous spirit of the times in the incessant\r\ncraving of the young cavaliers for notoriety and distinction in the\r\ntiltyard. Many examples of jousts and _pas d’armes_ of the fifteenth\r\ncentury are given in the _Chronique de Monstrelet_, the _Mémoires de la\r\nMarche_, and _Chastelain’s Cronique Jacques de Lalain_. The _Chronicle\r\nof Euguerrand de Monstrelet_, with its somewhat irregular continuations\r\nby de Couci and others, commences where that of Froissart leaves off,\r\nviz. in the year 1400; and it has the advantage of being for the most\r\npart contemporaneous in regard to the events it narrates. Monstrelet’s\r\nstyle of writing is less sprightly and more monotonous than that of\r\nFroissart; but he gives dates to his recitals, which, however, leave\r\nmuch to be desired on the score of accuracy. The names of personages\r\nand even towns given in the _Chronicles_ are most perplexing, being\r\nfrequently so distorted as to make identification an impossibility.\r\nLike Froissart, Monstrelet does not confine himself to the events of\r\nthe period under review in France and Burgundy, but deals also with\r\nthose of other countries in relation to them. The _Chronicles_, which\r\nreally amount to a history, afford a good insight into the subject of\r\nthe jousts and tourneys of the times; and Monstrelet states that his\r\ninformation was carefully collected from heralds, kings-of-arms and\r\nother officials of the lists. Monstrelet was born about 1390 and died\r\nin 1453.\r\n\r\nThe Bibliothèque de Bourgogne in the National Library at Brussels\r\npossesses many illuminations of the reign of Philip the Good and\r\nCharles the Bold; and there are also several in the Paris Collection\r\nand particularly in the _Armorial de la Toison d’Or_.\r\n\r\nAn Ashmolean MS., No. 1116, ff. 137b-86, gives the names and arms of\r\nthe sovereigns and knights of the Order of the Golden Fleece (Toison\r\nd’Or) from its institution in 1429 to the twenty-third festival of the\r\nOrder, which was held by Philip II, King of Spain, 12 Aug. 1559; it\r\ngives historical accounts of the celebration of the feasts. The MS.,\r\nwhich is in French, is beautifully written, with the arms tricked.\r\nOther MSS. in the same Collection, 139-66, 167-75b, of the year 1431,\r\ngive the statutes and ordinances of the Order.\r\n\r\nAppendix A furnishes an abstract of all the Ashmolean MSS. relating to\r\nthe tourney, for reference by our readers.\r\n\r\n_The Mémoires D’Olivier De La Marche_ teem with spirited descriptions\r\nof numerous _fêtes d’'armes_ held at the Burgundian court during\r\nthe reign of Duke Philippe le Bon, which are full of detail; and\r\nseveral of them bear the impress of having been written by an actual\r\neye-witness, with ample opportunities for getting information, and\r\nwith a sufficiency of technical knowledge for placing the scope and\r\nminutiæ of the encounters accurately and vividly before us. They\r\nalso afford invaluable details of the costumes of the period, giving\r\nminute particulars of the dresses, and all matters connected with the\r\nlists. The Seigneur de la Marche was a Burgundian, born about 1425; he\r\nwas appointed a page to his master the Duke in 1447, and was dubbed\r\nchevalier after the battle of Montlehéry. He distinguished himself\r\nbefore Ghent in 1452, was appointed a commissionary to the forces in\r\n1456, was made a prisoner at Nancy in 1476, and died in 1502. The\r\nMémoires cover a period of about fifty-three years, and form a very\r\nvaluable contribution to the history of the tourney. They were first\r\npublished in 1562.[108] Jean de Féore, Seigneur de St. Remy, describes\r\nsome of the _pas d’armes_ of the century; and the _Traité de Tournois_,\r\nby Louis de Bruges, written in the reign of Charles VIII, of France,\r\ndeals with others of a later period. The Beauchamp Peageants[109]\r\nafford some excellent illustrations of jousts and combats on foot and\r\non horseback. They are reproduced in the _History of the Life and Acts\r\nof Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick_, by John Rouse, the Warwickshire\r\nantiquary and historian, who died on the 14th of February, 1491, the\r\nseventh year of Henry VII. Earl Richard was born in 1381 and died\r\nin 1439. Hefner’s plates, Nos. 109 and 138, also picture jousts and\r\ntourneys of this period.\r\n\r\n_The Romance of Petit Jehan de Saintré_,[110] written in 1459, by\r\nAntoine de la Sale, contains fifteen large and fine illustrations\r\nof jousts, combats on foot, etc., which, as far as we can judge,\r\nfairly represent such knightly encounters of the period. Hewitt[111]\r\nmentions the equipments and colours, as shown on fol. 39: “_Near\r\nKnight._—Armour, iron-colour; feet, black; crest, red flower with\r\ngold leaves; saddle, bridle, and stirrup-leather, red; trapper, blue,\r\nmarked with darker blue and lined with white fur. _Far Knight._—Armour\r\nand feet as before; crest, gold with red feathers; saddle, buff;\r\ntrapper, dark with black markings; bells, gold. Chanfreins both ridged\r\nand spiked, gold; the rest iron. The barrier is red and marked with\r\na deeper red. It will be observed that, except the helm, the whole\r\narmour differs in nothing from the usual war suit.” The _Mémoires of\r\nthe Sire de Haynin_[112] afford some interesting details in connection\r\nwith _pas d’armes_.\r\n\r\nThe rules of the tourney promulgated by René d’Anjou, King of Naples,\r\nSicily and Jerusalem, and Duke of Lorraine, in _Tournois du Roi René_,\r\nare most important. They contain many restrictions in the use of\r\nweapons, and all tend towards restraining the violence and disorder\r\nwhich had hitherto prevailed, and towards rendering these warlike games\r\nless dangerous; and they inculcate a spirit of chivalry, thus doing\r\naway greatly with much of the brutality of the former age. René thought\r\nlances too cumbersome for the tourney, and considered the proper\r\nweapons to be rebated swords and maces. The famous duel between the\r\ndukes of Brittany and Bourbon is described. But little jousting took\r\nplace at Aix, the _mêlée_ being preferred. There are several splendid\r\nmanuscripts of the King’s writings extant, four of them at Paris,\r\nilluminated by the King himself, and they go into the minutest details\r\nof all which concern the tourney as practised at Aix.\r\n\r\n“The Ordinaunce, statutes and rules made by John Lord Typtofte, Erle\r\nof Worcester, Counstable of England by the Kinges commaundment, at\r\nWindsor the 29 of May ao sixto Edwardi quarti (1466), to be observed\r\nand kepte in all manner of Justes of pees royall with in this realme of\r\nEngland.”[113]\r\n\r\nThere are several copies of the rules extant. The version here given,\r\nin an abridged form, is taken from the _Antiquarian Repertory_. It was\r\ncopied from a MS. M. 61 in the Herald’s College.[114]\r\n\r\nAnother copy may be seen in _Nugae Antiquae_, by Park, which is\r\nreferred to in _Archæologia_, or the year 1813.[115] They are also\r\nprinted in Dr. Meyrick’s _Critical Essay on Antient Armor_, III,\r\n179-86, with valuable notes from the MS. M. 6, in the Herald’s College.\r\n\r\nThese rules run:—\r\n\r\n    “Firste, whoso breaketh most speares, as they ought to\r\n     be broken, shall have the price.\r\n\r\n     Item, whoso hitteth thre tymes in the heaulme, shall\r\n     have the price.\r\n\r\n     Item, whoso meteth two tymes coronoll to coronoll,\r\n     shall have the price.\r\n\r\n     Item, whoso beareth a man downe with stroke of speare,\r\n     shall have the price.\r\n\r\n                  _For the price._\r\n     Firste, whoso beareth a man downe owte of the saddell, or\r\n     putteth him to earthe, horse and man, shall have the price,\r\n     before him that striketh coronoll to coronoll two times.\r\n\r\n     Item, he that striketh coronoll to coronoll two tymes, shall\r\n     have the price before him that strike the sight thre tymes.\r\n\r\n     Item, he that striketh the sight thre tymes, shall have the\r\n     price before him that breake the moste speares.\r\n\r\n     Item, yf there be any man that fortunetly in this wise\r\n     shalbe deemed he bode longest in the feeld heaulmed, and\r\n     ranne the fairest course, and gave the greatest strokes,\r\n     helpinge himself best with his speare.”\r\n\r\n                  _How prices shalbe loste._\r\n     First.

Whosoe hitts the tilt twice shal be for the two times\r\n     abated, for 3 speares broken.\r\n\r\n     Fourth. Whosoe breaketh a speare within a foot of the\r\n     crownall (coronal), shall be judged as no speare broken, but\r\n     a good attaynte.\r\n\r\nA few short rules follow for the _mêlée_ and barriers.\r\n\r\nThere is much confusion in the nomenclature employed by chroniclers\r\nin their descriptions of these chivalric war-games, and the terms\r\n“_tournois_,” “tourney,” “joustes” or “_joûtes_” and “_pas d’armes_,”\r\nare often confounded with each other, all or any being sometimes used\r\nin a general sense to cover various forms of jousting and the tourney:\r\nand such meetings often received the general appellation of _fêtes\r\nd’armes_. In a contemporary recital of the meeting in 1559, which\r\nHenry II of France received his fatal wound, the terms “_joûtes_,”\r\n“_tournois_,” and _pas d’armes_ are all employed to express the\r\nproceedings as a whole. The term “tourney” is very frequently used to\r\ndenote the _mêlée_.\r\n\r\nA _pas d’armes_ or passage of arms usually covered a variety of martial\r\nexercises. It was open to all comers, being knights and esquires\r\nqualified to take part, who were invited by proclamation to attend.\r\nThe field was held by a certain number of challengers, called “_les\r\ntenans_” or holders of the _pas_; while the attacking cavaliers were\r\nknown as “_les venans_,” or comers, who came to try and wrest the _pas_\r\nfrom them. A _pas d’armes_ was also an imitation of an operation of\r\nwar, a _Scharmützel_, in the attack and defence of a supposed position\r\nof strength, such as a pasteboard bridge-head, a castle of wood or\r\nthe assumed gate to a town; the contest being waged with all the\r\nardour of real warfare, though tempered by certain rules, pretences\r\nand limitations. The term _pas d’armes_ is comprehensive, for besides\r\njousting and strokes with the sword, etc., such meetings often included\r\ncombats on foot; and, after the middle of the fifteenth century,\r\ncontests on horseback with the baston or mace; and they often concluded\r\nwith the tourney proper or _mêlée_, troop against troop.\r\n\r\nIn the _Antiquarian Repertory_[116] is the following account of a _pas\r\nd’armes_ held about the end of the fifteenth century:—\r\n\r\n      “The king assigns to four maidens of his court the\r\n    umpireship of the castle called ‘Loyall’; for the\r\n    attack and defence of which they are to arrange as they\r\n    may collectively decide upon. The castle is a mock\r\n    fortress, representing one which had been subjected to\r\n    a remarkable siege in history. The ladies confide its\r\n    guard and custody to a captain and fifteen cavaliers\r\n    to defend the ‘pas’ against all comers. A unicorn is\r\n    placed within the lists, the four legs of which support\r\n    as many shields, coloured white, red, yellow and blue\r\n    respectively. The first shield signifies the opening\r\n    jousts at the tilt, to be run in ‘hoasting’ armour,\r\n    with double or reinforcing pieces; the second shield\r\n    denotes that in the tourney which follows the jousting\r\n    twelve strokes with the sword are to be exchanged; the\r\n    third a combat on foot at barriers, the same number of\r\n    strokes with one-handed swords; the fourth, the defence\r\n    and assault of the castle, with swords, shields and\r\n    morris-pikes. The points and edges of all the weapons\r\n    employed in the four sections to be rebated, only the\r\n    foyne[117] excepted. Any cavalier, except the leader of\r\n    either side, if taken prisoner, may be ransomed with\r\n    three yards of satin, but captains must pay the cost of\r\n    thirteen yards for their freedom. The _pas d’armes_ to\r\n    continue from the 27th November to New Year’s Day. The\r\n    hours, after the first day, from one in the afternoon\r\n    to seven in the evening.”[118]\r\n\r\nOther clauses in the _Chapitres d’Armes_ are:—\r\n\r\n      “Item. Yt shalbe lawfull for the assaulters to devise\r\n    all manner of engynes for the wynenge of the said\r\n    castell; engyn or tole to breake the ground or howse\r\n    with all only excepted.\r\n\r\n      Item. None do meddell with fier neyther within or\r\n    without but to fire their gunnes.\r\n\r\n      Item. If any man be disarmed, he maye withdrawne\r\n    himselfe if he will; but once past the barres, he may\r\n    not com agayne into the torney for that daye. Also\r\n    there shall no man have his servant within the barres\r\n    with any peace of harnois, for no man shalbe within the\r\n    said barres but such as shalbe assigned by the king’s\r\n    grace.\r\n\r\n      Item. Who shall beste demeane himselfe at thee same\r\n    arte of armes, shall have a sword, garnished, to the\r\n    valew of three hundred crownes or under.\r\n\r\n      Item. If any man strike a horse with his speare, he\r\n    shalbe put out of the torny withowt any favour; and if\r\n    any slaye an horse, he shall paye to the owner of the\r\n    said horse an hundred crownes in recompence; also yt\r\n    is not to be thought that any man will slaye an horse\r\n    willingly; for if he do it, it shall be to his great dishonor.\r\n\r\n      Item. He that uses a close gauntlet (a locking or\r\n    forbiden gauntlet) shall win no prize.[119]\r\n\r\n      Item. He that his sword falleth owt of his hand, shal\r\n    win no prize.”\r\n\r\nThe gaining of prizes in jousting was settled as a rule by a counting\r\nof points, for and against, and they were usually:—\r\n\r\nBreaking a lance fairly on the body of an adversary, below the helmet,\r\n1 point; above the breast, 2 points; unhorsing, 3 points. Points\r\nwould be lost by striking the saddle or the tilt. A lance should be\r\nsplintered more than a foot above the head.\r\n\r\nThe long wars between France and England had engendered much hatred\r\nand bitterness between the nations, and frequent combats in the\r\nlists, _à outrance_, continued to take place between the respective\r\ncavaliers, many of which fights were characterized by great violence\r\nand ruthlessness. Matters at length got to such a pass that in the\r\nyear 1409 the French King issued an ordinance against all such combats\r\nbetween cavaliers of the two nations.[120] Certain combats, however,\r\ncontinued to take place under royal licence.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1400 by advice of the Earl of Huntingdon, “solemne iusts\r\nwere to be enterprised between him and 20 on his part, and the earle of\r\nSalisburie and 20 with him, at Oxford.” This was a conspiracy for the\r\nassassination of King Henry IV, but the plot miscarried.[121]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1400 Michel d’Oris, an esquire of Arragon, sent to Calais,\r\nby a pursuivant-at-arms, a challenge to a deed of arms, addressed to\r\nthe Cavaliers of England, in the following terms:—\r\n\r\n      “Au nom de Dieu, et de la benoite vierge Marie, de\r\n    saint Michel et de saint George, je, Michel d’Oris,\r\n    pour mon nom exhausser, sachant certainement la\r\n    renommée des prouesses de chevalerie d’Angleterre, ai,\r\n    au jour de la date de ces présentes, pris un tronçon de\r\n    gréve à porter à ma jambe jusqu’à tant qu’on chevalier\r\n    du dit royaume d’Angleterre m’aura délivré à faire\r\n    les armes qui s’ensuivent. Premièrement, d’entrer en\r\n    place à pied, et d’être armé chacun ainsi que bon lui\r\n    semblera, et d’avoir chacun sa dague et son épée sur\r\n    son corps, en quelque lieu qu’il lui plaira, ayant\r\n    chacun une hache, dont je baillerai la longueur. Et\r\n    sera le nombre des coups de tous les bâtons et armes\r\n    ensuivant: c’est à savoir: de la hache, dix coups sans\r\n    reprendre. Et quand ces dix coups seront parfaits et\r\n    que le juge dira: Ho! nous férirons dix coups d’épée\r\n    sans reprendre ni partier l’un de l’autre, et sans\r\n    changer harnois. Et quand le juge aura dit: Ho! nous\r\n    viendrons aux dagues et férirons dix coups sur main.\r\n    Et si aucun de nous perdoit ou laissoit cheoir un de\r\n    ses bâtons, l’autre pourra faire son plaisir du bâton,\r\n    qu’il tiendra jusqu’à ce que le juge ai dit: Ho! Et les\r\n    armes à pied accomplies, nous monterons à cheval; et\r\n    sera armé du corps chacun ainsi qu’il lui plaira, et\r\n    aura deux chapeaux de fer paraux, lesquels je liverai;\r\n    et choisra mon dit compagnon lequel qu’il lui plaira\r\n    des deux chapeaux: et aura chacun tel gorgerin qu’il\r\n    lui plaira, et avec ce, je baillerai deux selles, dont\r\n    mon dit compagnon aura le choix. Et outre plus, aurons\r\n    deux lances d’une longueur; desquelles lances nous\r\n    férirons vingt coups sans reprendre, à cheval, sur\r\n    main; et pourrons férir par devant et par derrière,\r\n    depuis le faux du corps en amont. Et icelles armes\r\n    de lances faites et accomplies, ferons les armes qui\r\n    s’ensuivent: C’est a savoir, s’il advenoit que l’un\r\n    ou l’autre ne fût blessé, nous serons tenus après, en\r\n    icelle journée même et au second jour après, férir de\r\n    coups de lance à course de chevaux à trois rangs, tant\r\n    que l’un ou l’autre cherra par terre ou soit blessé,\r\n    si qu’il n’en puisse plus faire. Et que chacun s’arme\r\n    à sa volonté le corps et la téte. Et les targes soient\r\n    de nerfs ou de cornes, sans ce qu’elles soient de fer\r\n    ni d’acier, ni qu’il y ait aucune maîtrise. Et courrons\r\n    les dites lances atout les selles que les dits chevaux\r\n    auront, faisant les dites armes à cheval: et chacun\r\n    liera et mettra ses étriers à sa volonté, sans faire\r\n    nulle maîtrise. Et pour y ajouter plus grande foi et\r\n    fermeté, je Michel d’Oris, ai scellé cette lettre du\r\n    sceau de mes armes: laquelle lettre fut faite et écrite\r\n    à Paris le vendredi vingtième jour d’Août l’an 1400.”[122]\r\n\r\nThis letter is given in full, for it affords much first-hand\r\ninformation in a concrete form of the procedure of a combat of the\r\nperiod as well as the manner of such cartels.\r\n\r\nThe letter states that the Spaniard had attached to his leg “_un\r\ntronçon de gréve_,” being a piece of a greave (armour for the shin),\r\npresumably of iron, causing him pain and inconvenience, which he had\r\nvowed to continue wearing until delivered from it by a combat with a\r\ngentleman of England. To this end he had sent his cartel to Calais,\r\nproclaiming his wish for such an encounter, laying down very precise\r\nconditions for a fight at which ten strokes with the axe, ten with\r\nthe sword, and the same number of thrusts with the dagger were to be\r\nexchanged; to be followed by twenty courses with lances, on horseback.\r\nThe pursuivant duly delivered the letter at Calais, where it was seen\r\nby Sir John Prendergast, who accepted the challenge in his own person,\r\non behalf of the chivalry of England, subject, of course, to the\r\npermission of his sovereign to the duel being obtained. No reply being\r\nforthcoming from the Spaniard within a reasonable time. Sir John sent\r\nhim a letter, stating that the time and place for the combat had been\r\narranged, and an umpire appointed. There being still no reply, another\r\nletter followed demanding an answer, and at length one arrived, with\r\nexcuses for the delay and complaining that Sir John had broken the\r\ntreaty in an umpire having been chosen without the name having been\r\nfirst submitted to him; though showing no burning desire to have the\r\nmatter arranged to his own satisfaction. The correspondence continued\r\nover four years and came to nothing after all; but for how long the\r\nSpaniard continued wearing the piece of greave pricking his leg history\r\ndoes not tell.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1402 the Sire de Harpedenne, Seneschal de Saintonge, having\r\nheard that certain English knights desired to perform a deed of arms\r\nfor the love of their ladies, suggested to the Duke of Orleans that six\r\ngentlemen of his household should challenge a like number of English\r\ncavaliers to a combat _à outrance_. The duke agreeing, the invitation\r\nwas duly sent and promptly accepted, the fight to take place near\r\nBordeaux on the 19th May, 1402. Much pressure was brought to bear on\r\nthe duke to induce him to withdraw his sanction, on the ground that\r\nsuch a combat would tend to increase the bitterness between the nations\r\nwhich already prevailed; but he continued to encourage the scheme, and\r\neven went to Saint Denis to pray for the success of his countrymen.\r\nArnault Guilhem, Sire de Barbazan, a chevalier of repute, undertook the\r\nleadership of the French contingent.\r\n\r\nThe Sire de Harpedenne and the Earl of Rutland were appointed umpires\r\nof the fight; and on the arrival of the French chevaliers at the place\r\nof combat they heard Mass, and the Sire de Barbazan addressed them on\r\nthe justice of their cause, animating them to deeds of valour for their\r\ncountry’s sake; while the Englishmen thought more of a good meal before\r\nfighting. According to the French account of the fight, the Englishmen\r\nhad conceived a stratagem for two of their number, by preconcerted\r\naction, suddenly to assail one of the French cavaliers, with the object\r\nof reducing their number to five, as against the English six; but the\r\nplan failed, and it was one of the Englishmen that was killed, thus\r\nturning the tables.[123] This gave a preponderance to the Frenchmen,\r\nbut the fight continued long, obstinate and bloody, resulting in the\r\nvictory of the French.[124]\r\n\r\nIn the same year Louis, Duke of Orleans, sent a challenge to Henry\r\nIV, King of England, proposing a combat between them with lances,\r\nbattle-axes, swords and daggers, the fight to continue until one of\r\nthem surrendered, which the king declined, on the ground that he could\r\nonly fight with his equal.\r\n\r\nIn 1403 a deed of arms, _à outrance_, was performed at Valentia, four\r\nSpanish cavaliers against four Frenchmen, the King of Arragon acting as\r\numpire; and the articles of combat provided for a fight on foot with\r\naxes, swords and daggers. The Seneschal of Hainault led the French, and\r\nthe Seigneur de Sainte Coulombe, a member of the king’s household, the\r\nSpaniards. Highly decorated lists had been erected for the occasion,\r\nand the king took his seat on the tribune, expressing the hope that the\r\nfight might not take place; but the parties urged that great expense\r\nhad been incurred, and that the French cavaliers had come from a\r\ndistance at heavy charges in answer to the challenge. The king yielded\r\nto these arguments, and gave the signal for the onset. A gallant fight\r\nwith axes ensued, during which one of the Spaniards seized a Frenchman\r\nby the leg and was preparing to stab him with his dagger when the king\r\ncast his bâton, putting an end to the conflict, to the great chagrin of\r\nboth sides.[125]\r\n\r\nPlate XI in _Horda Angel-Cynnan_ “shewes how atte coronacion of quene\r\nJane[126] erle Richarde kepte juste for the quene’s part ageynst\r\nall commers, when he so notably and so knyghtly behaved himself, as\r\nredounded to his noble fame and perpetuall worship.” Sir Richard was\r\nthen twenty-two years old. The illustration shows a joust at the tilt,\r\nrun with lances tipped with coronals, the earl’s crest being the bear\r\nand ragged staff. The armour and general aspect of the picture point\r\nto the period when the Memoir was written rather than to the actual\r\ndate of the joust. The tilt is of four planks, and appears to be nearly\r\nsix feet in height. The royal party is seated in a balcony overlooking\r\nthe lists, and there are raised galleries for the officials and\r\nbetter-class spectators, and seats on the level of the lists for the\r\ngeneral public.\r\n\r\nPlate XX. Sir Pandolf Malatesta sent a challenge to Earl Richard,\r\nfirst to joust, and “then go togedres with axes; after which armyng\r\nswerdes;[127] and last with sharp daggers.” The jousting finished,\r\n“they went to gedres with axes, and if the lord Calcot hadde not the\r\nsonner cried peas, Sir Pandolf sore wounded on the left shoulder hadde\r\nbeen utterly slayn on the felde.”[128] The illustration pictures the\r\ncombat on foot with _becs de faucon_, weapons more picks than axes. The\r\nhelmets are armets, the earl’s crest his well-known cognizance, and he\r\nwears a tabard-shaped surcoat. The equipment is not contemporaneous\r\nwith the time of the duel, but rather that of the date of the Memoir.\r\nThe plate in _Horda_ is reproduced on our Plate I. The copy from the\r\nMS. is not quite correct in the delineation of the weapon wielded by\r\nthe earl, owing to a blur on the original.\r\n\r\nPlate XXVIII pictures a combat on horseback, with rebated swords.\r\n\r\nPlate XXXV shows Earl Richard jousting at the tilt incognito. He wears\r\na “volant-piece.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE I_\r\n\r\nCOMBAT ON FOOT BETWEEN SIR RICHARD BEAUCHAMP AND SIR PANDOLF MALATESTA]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TAPESTRY AT VALENCIENNES]\r\n\r\nPlate XXXVI. The earl is jousting at the tilt. “The erle smote up the\r\nvisar (of his adversary) thries, and brake his besauges and other\r\nharneys.”\r\n\r\nPlate XXXVII pictures the earl jousting with his face exposed.\r\n\r\nPlate XL “shewes howe a mighty duke chalenged erle Richard for his lady\r\nsake, and he justyng slewe the duke,” the lance going through his body.\r\nThis joust is with sharp lances in the open. The duke wears a jousting\r\nshield, and the earl a “volant-piece.”\r\n\r\nIn 1415 three Portuguese cavaliers fought the same number of Frenchmen,\r\nat St. Ouen, near Paris, in presence of the King of France. The\r\ncombat was a severe one, resulting at length in the discomfiture of\r\nthe Portuguese, who succumbed to the Frenchmen. The manner of this\r\nsurrender so disgusted the authorities and spectators that the defeated\r\nparty was forcibly expelled the lists.[129]\r\n\r\nIn 1420 there were several curious subterranean combats, between French\r\nand English cavaliers, at Montereau, that town being then besieged by\r\nthe troops of the Dauphin. The English had laid mines extensively under\r\nthe walls; and it was in these excavations that the fights took place,\r\nby the light of the flambeaux and torches. The first who fought on the\r\nFrench side was Louis Juvenal des Ursins, a valiant esquire, son of the\r\nadvocate-general, who was dubbed a chevalier on the occasion. The King\r\nof England and Duke of Burgundy were present, and wished to break a\r\nlance together, from which, however, they were dissuaded. The Sire de\r\nBarbazan jousted with the king, at first without knowing who he was,\r\nbut as soon as he became aware that it was his Majesty, he respectfully\r\nretired from the contest. Everything passed with great courtesy between\r\nthe members of the two nations, and the king gave great praise to the\r\ncavaliers engaged.[130]\r\n\r\nIn the seventh year of Henry V “triumphant iusts and turneis, in the\r\nwhiche, Erle of Arundell, and the Bastard of Sent Polle by the iudgment\r\nof the Ladies, won the price and got the honor.”[131]\r\n\r\nA combat on horseback and on foot took place at Arras in 1425,[132]\r\nbetween the Sires de Sainte-Treille and Lionel de Vendôme, the Duke\r\nof Burgundy acting as umpire. On the first day the chevaliers ran six\r\ncourses with the lance, and de Vendôme was slightly wounded in the\r\nhead. The day following they fought on foot with axes of the _bec\r\nde faucon_ type, and de Vendôme attacked his adversary with great\r\nimpetuosity, but all his strokes were parried. Sainte-Treille then\r\ndelivered several blows on the visor of his opponent, forcing it open,\r\nleaving the face exposed; then hooking his axe in the opening wounded\r\nde Vendôme slightly in the face with his gauntlet, perceiving which the\r\nduke cast his bâton. A joust followed between the Sire de Champremi\r\nand the Bastard of Rosbeque, the latter piercing the armour of his\r\nadversary with his lance, on which the duke’s bâton fell.[133]\r\n\r\nThe _bec de faucon_ or _bec de corbin_ was a weapon with a curved\r\nbeak-like spike or pick, as its name implies, sometimes with a blade at\r\nthe opposite side, at others with a narrow _mail_ or mallet, with four\r\nshort points, somewhat like those on the coronal to a lance, though\r\nsharper: in both varieties there is usually a long spike at the head\r\nand a point at the foot; strictly speaking, however, a weapon with a\r\nblade can hardly be termed a _bec de faucon_. An illustration is given\r\nin “Barriers and Foot Combats,” a paper by Viscount Dillon,[134] of\r\na weapon of this kind belonging to Captain Hutton, which has a beak\r\nor pick on one side, and opposite to it a _mail_ or mallet of four\r\npoints and a spike at the head. There is another example at the Musée\r\nd’Artillerie, Paris, with a very pronounced beak, but neither _mail_\r\nnor spear. It is stated in Lord Dillon’s paper that in the duel between\r\nMerlo and de Charny, at Arras in 1435, before the fighting began, an\r\nobjection was lodged by Charny’s friends against the Spaniard using a\r\n_bec de faucon_, axes being stipulated for in the _Chapitres d’Armes_.\r\nIt was contended that the weapon was not an axe at all; but after\r\nsome discussion the objection was not pressed. The weapon, which is a\r\nterrible one, does not seem to have been much used in Germany.\r\n\r\nIn 1428 a grand tournament was held at Brussels. The Duke of Burgundy\r\nattended and was magnificently entertained and feasted by his cousin,\r\nDuke Philip of Brabant, and the City of Brussels. The Lady of Gezebêque\r\nawarded the prizes. The dukes announced their intention of jousting\r\ntogether, but were dissuaded from doing so by the kings-of-arms, for\r\nfear of accidents. Many cavaliers took part, before a great concourse\r\nof nobles, ladies, and the general public. The prize for the most\r\nsuccessful combatant in the first day’s fighting was awarded to a\r\ngentleman of Brabant named Linquart. On the morrow and following days\r\nthere was great jousting, and the Duke of Brabant and the Seigneur\r\nde Mamines were adjudged to be the best lances, and the prizes were\r\nawarded to them. This _fête d’armes_ was distinguished by great\r\nsplendour, and banquets, dances, masquerades and other mummeries\r\ncontinued for several days.[135]\r\n\r\nIn 1430 a combat took place in the great market-place at Arras,\r\nbetween five French and a like number of Burgundian cavaliers, under\r\nthe umpireship of the Duke of Burgundy, for the breaking of a certain\r\nnumber of lances. The French contingent consisted of the Seigneurs\r\nThéode de Valeperghe, Pothon de Sainte-Treille, Philibert d’Abrecy,\r\nGuillaume de Bes and L’Estendard de Nully; that of the Burgundians\r\nof Simon de Lalain, the Seigneurs de Charny, Jean de Vaulde, Nicolle\r\nand Philibert de Menton. The combat was to continue over five days.\r\nLists were prepared, “_garnie d’aisselles, afin que les chevaux ne ce\r\npuissent recontrer l’un l’autre_,” and here we have an example of a\r\njoust at the tilt.\r\n\r\nOn the first day de Lalain jousted with de Valeperghe, when the latter,\r\nwith his horse, was thrown violently to the ground. Jousts followed\r\nover the second, third, fourth and fifth days, in which many lances\r\nwere broken. In the third course run between de Charny and d’Abrecy,\r\nthe visor of the latter’s “armet” was pierced by his opponent’s\r\nlance, causing a very serious wound in the face; and on the last day\r\nthe same thing happened to de Nully, in jousting with Philibert de\r\nMenton. The injured knights were removed to their lodgings, and left\r\nbehind in charge of the surgeons; both subsequently recovered from\r\ntheir wounds. On the conclusion of the _fête d’armes_, the honours lay\r\nwith the Burgundians, and the duke loaded the Frenchmen with handsome\r\npresents.[136]\r\n\r\nIn 1435 there was a passage at arms at Arras, held under the umpireship\r\nof Duke Philip of Burgundy; and seated on the bench near him were the\r\ndukes of Bourbon and Cueldres, with other noblemen of distinction. The\r\nparties to the duel were Messire Juan de Merlo, a chevalier banneret\r\nof Spain, and Pierre de Beauffrement, Sire de Charny, a banneret of\r\nBurgundy, knight of the Toison d’Or, and one of the most noted jousters\r\nof his day. The articles of combat provided for a joust of three\r\ncourses, and then a combat on foot, with axes, swords and daggers,\r\nto be continued until one of the twain was placed _hors de combat_,\r\nthough, as always, subject to the fiat of the judge. The Spaniard\r\nfirst entered the lists attended by four noble cavaliers, who had\r\nbeen specially attached to his person by the orders of the duke. De\r\nCharny followed, attended by the Comtes d’Étampes, de Saint Pol and de\r\nLigny; and with them was the Earl of Suffolk, who carried the lances\r\nto be used on the occasion. The champions ran the three courses with\r\nthe lance, without mishap to either beyond a slight fracture to the\r\narmet of the Spaniard. This ended the contest for the first day; and\r\non the morrow the combat on foot took place. It began with the knights\r\nhurling lances at each other, the weapon of the Spaniard striking the\r\nBurgundian on the arm, causing a slight wound, notwithstanding which\r\nthe fight continued with axes. The combatants displayed much skill and\r\ngallantry with their weapons, without much advantage to either knight,\r\nwhen quite unexpectedly the duke cast his bâton, putting an end to\r\nthe fight. The Spaniard protested most energetically to the duke at\r\nthe combat being brought to so premature an end, urging that he had\r\ntravelled a long way in order to achieve this feat of arms, and had\r\nbeen put to a vast expense. The duke appeased him, however, by praising\r\nhis gallantry, and ordered a handsome present in money to be paid to\r\nhim to cover his outlay. This duel is remarkable as furnishing an early\r\ninstance of fighting with the visor up. To set against the danger of\r\nhaving part of the face exposed, it gave great advantage in the way\r\nof vision, in clearness as well as in radius. The visor was a mark so\r\noften aimed at, and was in its nature very vulnerable.[137]\r\n\r\nIn the twentieth year of King Henry VI a French Chevalier named Louis\r\nde Bueille challenged Rafe Chalons, an esquire of England, to a feat of\r\narms; and the King of France was present at the meeting. The Englishman\r\nran the Frenchman through the body and killed him.[138]\r\n\r\nSir John Astley fought on foot with the Chevalier Philip Boyle of\r\nArragon at Smithfield in the year 1442, King Henry VI acting as umpire.\r\nAn illustration in the MS. in the possession of Lord Hastings pictures\r\nquadrangular lists of open railings showing the openings and the bars\r\nfor closing them. They are of a kind usually erected for combats of\r\nthis nature. King Henry sits in the tribune; and within the lists,\r\nbesides the principals, is a herald-at-arms and a guard of four, armed\r\nwith battle-axes, for keeping the ring. The combatants wear bascinets;\r\nbases; solerets, _à la Poulaine_; and tabard-shaped surcoats, on which\r\nthe respective arms of the parties are embroidered. Boyle’s axe has a\r\nflook or _bec de faucon_ and an axe-blade; that of Astley’s a blade and\r\na three-pronged mail or mell. The MS. does not state the issue of the\r\nfight.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[99] Referred to by Wendelin Boeheim in _Meister der\r\nWaffenschmeidekunst_, Chap. LVII.\r\n\r\n[100] Chap.

The\r\naccount of this meeting has a great historical value, owing not only\r\nto its reference to the tilt, additional pieces, and special forms of\r\narmour, but also to the amount of detail it presents. It is given here\r\nin a much abridged form.\r\n\r\nThirteen noble Burgundians of distinction, headed by Pierre de\r\nBauffremont, Chevalier, Seigneur de Charny, held the _pas_ for six\r\nweeks against all comers. De la Marche remarks that during the time\r\nnecessary for erecting the lists and making the general arrangements\r\nfor the meeting the young cavaliers practised various forms of jousting\r\nbefore the duke “_et là furent faictes une jouste à selles plattes, et\r\nen harnois de ioûte_.” He graphically pictures the general arrangements\r\nfor this _pas d’armes_, the profuse hospitality extended to all\r\ncomers, the construction and decoration of the lists, the dresses and\r\nequipments of the officials, pages, combatants, etc. He describes the\r\nlists for jousting as follows, making clear mention of the tilt:—“_et\r\nau milieu d’icelle lice fut la toille mise, pour la conduitte des\r\nchevaux, et pour servir à la course des hommes d’armes, comme il est de\r\ncoustume en tel cas._” “_Celle lice fut de bonne hauteur et grandeur:\r\net, aux deux bouts de ladicte lice, furent faictes deux marches: qui se\r\nmontoyent à degrés, faits de ce bonne grandeur, que l’on pouvoit aider\r\nà l’hommes d’armes, tout à cheval, pour l’armer aiser, ou desarmer,\r\nselon le cas: et hors de ladicte lice, du costé de Digeon, aux jours\r\nqu’il besoing faisoit, avoit une grande tente, haute et spacieuse,\r\ntendue, pour aider et soulager le venant de dehors, si mestier en\r\navoit._” There was another enclosure for combats on foot.\r\n\r\nDuring the duration of the _pas_ two shields were hung suspended in\r\nthe lists: one, painted black, besprinkled with gilded tear-drops; the\r\nother, violet, _semé_, with tear-drops in black. Each venant who,\r\nthrough a pursuivant, placed a gage, such as a sword or spur, below the\r\nfirst-named shield, signified his election to engage on horseback one\r\nof the tenans or defenders of the _pas_, and to run twelve courses,\r\n“_à la toille_,” that is along the tilt, with sharp or rebated lances\r\nat his pleasure; and should either of the jousters be unhorsed he was\r\nto present his adversary with a diamond of whatever value he pleased.\r\nThe venant who placed his gage below the violet shield, with tear-drops\r\nin black, elected a combat on foot, consisting of fifteen strokes with\r\nthe axe or estoc;[140] but should he place gages below both shields,\r\nhis challenge applied to a joust at the tilt and a foot encounter as\r\nwell. The duke took his seat on the 11th July, 1443, holding a white\r\nwand or bâton in his hand as judge, which when cast down put an end to\r\na fight at any stage, the officials at once separating the combatants.\r\nWe describe briefly a few of the encounters. The first contest lay\r\nbetween the leader of the tenans, the Seigneur de Charny, and a\r\nSpanish cavalier of mark, Pietre-Vasque de Suavedra. The chevalier\r\nvenant having placed gages below both shields, the combat was to be\r\non foot, to be followed by another on horseback; and on the opening\r\nday the champions entered the enclosure for foot contests at 9 o’clock\r\nin the morning. The choice of weapons, as between axes and _épées\r\nd’armes_,[141] lay with the chevalier venant, who chose axes. Eight\r\nmen-at-arms in complete armour, bearing white wands, ranged themselves\r\nin the enclosure, to keep the ring and to separate the combatants when\r\nnecessary. The duke gave the signal and the combat began. Suavedra\r\nhad taken off his visor, while Charny fought with his visor down. The\r\nstipulated fifteen strokes having been exchanged, without bodily injury\r\nto either party, the combatants were separated and left the lists.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th day of the same month the jousting between the same\r\ncavaliers took place. The Spaniard first entered the lists with his\r\nfollowing, his horse trapped in blue and white silk, and presented\r\nhimself before the judge. De Charny followed in like manner, the\r\ntrapper of his charger being of cloth of gold; he was attended both by\r\nhis esquires and by five pages on horseback, sumptuously attired in\r\nblue and violet satin. The onset having been sounded, the champions\r\ncharged, each splintering his lance on the body of his antagonist in\r\nthe centre of the lists; in their second career both lances glanced\r\noff, and so on until the number of courses had been run. Challengers\r\ncontinued to come forward, and each combat is recorded by the\r\nchronicler in its turn.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of August a joust took place between an Italian, Jacques de\r\nVisque, Comte de St. Martin, and the Chevalier Guillame de Vaudrey,\r\n“_qui couroit de droit et du long de la toile_.” In the first course\r\nSt. Martin was struck on the visor of his helmet by the lance of his\r\nopponent, the fastening being broken; in the fourth he was wounded\r\nseverely in the lance-arm, the lance-head remaining in the wound, and\r\nthe expressions of regret at the occurrence were so general as to show\r\nthat serious injuries in such encounters had become comparatively rare.\r\nThis mounted contest was followed by a combat on foot between Anthoine\r\nde Vaudrey and Jehan de Compays, Seigneur de Torain. The venant chose\r\n_estocs_, and a smart fight ensued, without personal injury to either\r\nchevalier, though their armour was much battered and torn.\r\n\r\nThe chronicler continues his narrations of the various combats which\r\nfollowed during the remaining days provided for in the _Chapitres\r\nd’Armes_, throughout the course of which the defenders of the _pas_\r\nheld it against all comers with conspicuous honour and distinction. The\r\ntenans of the _pas d’armes_ made an offering to the Virgin of the two\r\nshields of L’Arbre de Charlemagne, which were hung suspended in the\r\nChurch of Nôtre Dame at Dijon.\r\n\r\nWhile de la Marche devotes his narration more to the fighting and\r\nspectacular aspects of the meeting, Monstrelet deals with the\r\nchallenges and _chapitres d’armes_.\r\n\r\n                        THE CHALLENGES\r\n\r\n      “In honour of our Lord, and his most glorious mother,\r\n    of my Lady Sainte Anne, and of my lord St George, I,\r\n    Pierre de Bauffremont, lord of Chargny, of Monliet and\r\n    of Montfort, knight, councellor and chamberlain, to the\r\n    most high, most puissant and excellent prince the Duke\r\n    of Burgundy, make known to all princes, barons, knights\r\n    and esquires, without reproach, with the exception of\r\n    those of the kingdom of France and of the countries in\r\n    alliance, or subjects to my said sovereign lord, that\r\n    for the augmentation and extension of the most noble\r\n    profession and exercise of arms, my will and intention\r\n    is, in conjunction with twelve knights, esquires\r\n    and gentlemen, of four quarterings, whose names\r\n    follow:—Thibault, lord of Rougemont and Mussy; Messire\r\n    William Breremont, lord of Sees and of Sauvegon;\r\n    William de Brenne, lord of Mombis and of Gilly; John,\r\n    lord of Valengen; John, lord of Rap and of Tirecourt;\r\n    William de Champdivers, lord of Chivigny; John de\r\n    Chiron, lord of Rancheinères; Antony de Vaudray, lord\r\n    of Aille; William de Vaudray, lord of Collaon; James\r\n    de Challant, lord of Ainvilie; Messire Amé, lord of\r\n    Espirey; and John de Chavigny,—to guard and defend a\r\n    _pas d’armes_, situated on the great road leading from\r\n    Dijon towards Auxonne, at the end of the causeway from\r\n    the said town of Dijon, at a great tree called the\r\n    Hermit’s Tree in the form and manner following.\r\n\r\n      “In the first place, two shields, (one black\r\n    besprinkled with tears of gold,—the other violet,\r\n    having tears of sable), shall be suspended on the tree\r\n    of the Hermit, and all those who shall, by a king at\r\n    arms or pursuivant, touch the first shield, shall be\r\n    bounden to perform twelve courses on horseback with\r\n    me, or with one of my aforesaid knights or esquires,\r\n    with blunted lances.—Item, if either of the champions,\r\n    during their twelve courses, be unhorsed by a direct\r\n    blow with the lance on his armour, such person, thus\r\n    unhorsed, shall present to his adversary a diamond of\r\n    whatever value he please.—Item, the champions may arm\r\n    themselves according to their pleasure, _double or\r\n    single_,[142] but without any wicked intentions, having\r\n    their rest similar to the usual custom in war.—Item,\r\n    each person shall make provision of lances—but the\r\n    rondelle, which lies on the hands, shall be only\r\n    four fingers broad, and no more.[143] Item, the lances\r\n    shall be all of similar length, from the point to\r\n    the rest.—Item, for the accomplishment of these\r\n    feats of arms on horseback, I will supply all who may\r\n    come without lances, precisely like to my own and to\r\n    those of my companions.—Item, these deeds of arms on\r\n    horseback shall be performed _à la toille_, which shall\r\n    be six feet high.”\r\n\r\n                     _Chapitres d’Armes._\r\n      “Those princes, barons, knights and esquires, of the\r\n    rank before mentioned, who shall rather take their\r\n    pleasure in performing feats of arms on foot, shall\r\n    touch the violet shield, and shall perform fifteen\r\n    strokes with battle-axes or swords, as may be most\r\n    agreeable to them.\r\n\r\n      “Item, if, during these courses, any champion shall\r\n    touch the ground with his hand or knees, he shall\r\n    be bounden to present his adversary with a ruby of\r\n    whatever value he please.—Item, each champion _shall\r\n    be armed with the accustomed armour for combating in\r\n    lists_.[144]—Item, should any person be unprovided with\r\n    battle-axe or sword, I will furnish him with the same,\r\n    similar to my own or to those of my companions. These\r\n    axes and swords are not to have anything extraordinary\r\n    in their make, but such as are usual in these kinds of\r\n    combats.\r\n\r\n      “Item, he that shall have engaged himself to fight\r\n    with me, or either of us, and shall throw the other\r\n    to the ground, the person so thrown shall be obliged\r\n    to surrender himself a prisoner whithersoever the\r\n    conqueror shall order him.—Item, the person thus\r\n    made prisoner shall pay for his immediate ransom, to\r\n    whomsoever the conqueror shall direct, any sum above\r\n    five hundred crowns.\r\n\r\n      “Item, foreigners need not seek for particulars\r\n    from me, or from my companions, for they will find\r\n    persons ready to deliver such at the usual hours and\r\n    places.—Item, no stranger will be permitted to enter\r\n    the lists with me or with any one of my companions, for\r\n    more than one course at arms, namely, once on horseback\r\n    and once on foot—and no one can require more of any of\r\n    us during the present undertaking.\r\n\r\n      “Item, the aforesaid feats of arms, on horseback and\r\n    on foot, shall be performed on the following days:\r\n    those on horseback on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays;\r\n    those on foot, Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays.\r\n\r\n      “Item, this pas d’armes shall commence on the first\r\n    day of July in the year 1443, and shall last forty\r\n    days, exclusive of feast-days and Sundays, and the\r\n    feasts commanded to be kept by the court of Rome.\r\n\r\n      “Item, no prince, baron, knight or esquire, shall\r\n    pass within a quarter of a league of the spot assigned\r\n    for these combats without entering the lists and taking\r\n    part, or otherwise leaving as pledges his sword or\r\n    spurs, according to his pleasure.\r\n\r\n      “Item, for the accomplishment of these feats of\r\n    arms, as well on horseback as on foot, according to\r\n    the articles above specified, I have most humbly\r\n    supplicated and entreated my aforesaid sovereign lord,\r\n    that he would grant me his licence and permission to\r\n    perform them, which he has most benignantly assented\r\n    to. He has likewise most graciously appointed, as judge\r\n    of the lists, that puissant prince and my most redoubted\r\n    lord, the count of Nevers and of Rethel—and in his absence,\r\n    the lord marshal, count of Fribourg and of Neufchâtel.\r\n\r\n      “Item, in order that this my intention of performing\r\n    these deeds of arms in the manner before specified may\r\n    be more fully declared, I have fixed my seal to these\r\n    presents, and signed them with my own hand, this 8th\r\n    day of March, in the year 1442.\r\n\r\n      “Item, all noble foreigners shall have sure and loyal\r\n    pass-ports from my aforesaid sovereign lord, or in his\r\n    absence from his marshal.”\r\n\r\nOn such occasions a proclamation was made against outsiders giving\r\nsignals to any combatant.\r\n\r\nThe following documents occur among the Harleian MSS.:—\r\n\r\n       Le Declaracon du Pas a l’Arbre D’Or.\r\n\r\n       i.e. How the Lady L’Isle sent her Knight with a Rich\r\n     Tree of Gold, for him to Sett near Brughes, and there\r\n     to Challenge the Nobles of the Duke of Burgundies Court\r\n     both to the Justs, ＆ to the Tourney: the Articles\r\n     whereof do follow.

Duke Philip of Burgundy\r\nacted as umpire, and was supported on the tribune by the Duke of\r\nOrleans; and immediately before the fight began Lalain was dubbed a\r\nchevalier.\r\n\r\nLists had been prepared, and after the usual preliminaries were over a\r\ncombat on foot between the parties took place, followed by many courses\r\nat the tilt.\r\n\r\nThe combatants entered the lists for the fight on foot, each bearing\r\na heavy sword in the right hand and in the left a _hache d’armes_; a\r\nsmaller sword was attached to the belt, and small rectangular shields\r\nwere carried on the left arms. Lalain fought with part of his face\r\nexposed, half of his visor having been removed. The parties took up\r\ntheir positions some distance from each other, and the fight began by\r\nBoniface hurling his spear at Lalain, who parried it. The latter cast\r\nhis sword at his opponent, but without effect; then each threw his\r\nshield at the other’s legs with a view of causing him to stumble, and\r\nthe fight at close quarters with axes began. After some hard blows\r\nhad been exchanged Boniface dropped his axe, and Lalain struck at his\r\nvisor, in which his axe struck until the point broke. Boniface then\r\nseized the Burgundian’s weapon and drew his dagger, hoping to stab\r\nhis opponent in the face, but Lalain with admirable _sang-froid_ beat\r\ndown that weapon, and striking the visor of his opponent, slightly\r\npenetrated one of the apertures with his axe, Boniface then drew his\r\nsword and struck savagely at Lalain; at which stage of the combat the\r\nduke’s bâton fell.\r\n\r\nThe jousting was accomplished later on, with varying fortune, though\r\nwithout special features. It was at the tilt, “_et au milieu de la\r\nlice avoit une toille, pour conduire les chevauz, pour les courses de\r\nlances, qu’ils devoyent accomplir_.”\r\n\r\nThe armour of de Lalain was provided with reinforcing pieces: “_Messire\r\nJacques de Lalain estoit armé de plusieures rondelles, l’une sur la\r\nmain, l’autre sur le coude du bras de la bride, et l’autre tenant\r\nau gardebras, a maniére d’escu_,” but they were detached before the\r\njousting, Boniface being without them.[146] The different chroniclers\r\nof such combats differ more or less in many details.\r\n\r\nThe position and dignity of an esquire is defined in Ashmolean MS.\r\n162a:[147] “The definition of an Esquire and the severall sortes of\r\nthem according to the customs and usage of England. _An esquire called\r\nin Latine armiger...._”[148]\r\n\r\nAnother of these MSS., 158ab, defines the duties and emoluments of a\r\nking-at-arms.—The office of a Kinge at Armes. “Fyrst as nyghe as he\r\ncanne he shall take knowledge and kepe recorde of creastes cognissances\r\nand auntient used wordes,” etc.[149]\r\n\r\nThe principal additional or reinforcing pieces, _pièces d’avantage_,\r\nare:—the grand-guard or main-guard, which is in two plates, the\r\nvolante-piece and the body portion, and these, though sometimes\r\nseparate, are usually riveted together. The former is adapted to the\r\ncontour of the helmet, to which it is firmly attached; while the\r\nlatter, fixed to the breastplate, conforms to the curves of the neck,\r\nfits round the left side of the chest and left shoulder, and is flanged\r\nover the right shoulder to protect the weak place at the armpit on\r\nthat side. The whole thus forms a double defence for that portion\r\nof the body against which an attack was mainly directed. The term\r\n“volante-piece,” as applied to the face piece of the grand-guard, is,\r\nhowever, of doubtful authority. It is sometimes referred to in English\r\nchronicles, though without stating what it really is. Meyrick employs\r\nit in the sense above referred to, but Lord Dillon[150] inclines to the\r\nopinion that the term properly belongs to the two extra plates over the\r\nforehead attachable to some helmets, and I am sure he is right. These\r\nplates are present on jousting salades, and are called _Stirnplätten_\r\nor _Stirndoppolstuck_ (forehead-plates) by the Germans. However this\r\nmay be it is convenient to apply the term generally in use unless\r\nquite assured of its incorrectness. The elbow-guard or pas-guard is a\r\nreinforcement for the left elbow-joint, fastened by a pin. The manifer,\r\nor mainfere, _main de fer_, _steife henze_, or miton-gauntlet is the\r\nstiff, heavy jousting gauntlet for the bridle hand and forearm; the\r\nname “manifer” is given by Meyrick to the crinet, absurdly connecting\r\nthe word with the mane of the horse. The poldermiton or _épaule de\r\nmouton_, is a piece for the defence of the right forearm and bend,\r\nwhich is further protected by the vamplate of the lance. In the course\r\nwith sharp lances, called _Scharfrennen_ by the Germans, a dilge or\r\njousting-cuisse is employed, strapped to the saddle; and there was an\r\narmlet for the right lower arm, used in that and some other courses.\r\nThe jousting-shields differ in form in the various courses: they will\r\nbe described in their order.\r\n\r\nCatalogue No. 383 of the Wallace Collection, London, comprises a\r\nsmall set of additional pieces, which from the subject and character\r\nof enrichment (chevrons with minute pomegranates and scrolls, etched\r\nand gilt) would appear to have belonged to a suit of armour in the\r\npossession of the Duke of Northumberland, at Alnwick Castle, which was\r\nacquired in Italy by Duke Algernon, about the year 1840; and it has\r\nbeen freely and excellently restored.\r\n\r\nWhen arming, the additional pieces were screwed on one after the other,\r\nthe jousting-shield being adjusted last. This process completed, the\r\njouster was almost immune from injury and was left almost an automaton,\r\nwith little power of initiative beyond aiming his lance, and that with\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nJacques de Lalain sent a challenge to a feat of arms in the year 1448\r\nto James, brother to Earl Douglas; the fight to take place in Edinburgh\r\nin the same year. He stated the conditions of combat proposed, for a\r\nfoot encounter, _à outrance_, with spear, battle-axe, sword and dagger,\r\nwhich conditions were accepted by Douglas, with the reservation, at\r\nthe instance of the King of Scotland, that no lance-casting should\r\nbe allowed. The Burgundian party consisted of Jacques and his uncle\r\nSimon de Lalain, and a Messire de Mériadacq; while a Scottish trio,\r\nthe brothers Douglas and a Lord de Haguet, arranged to fight them: the\r\nKing to act as umpire. After some initial misunderstanding the knights\r\nfought paired against one another as follows:—Haguet against Simon de\r\nLalain, Jacques against James Douglas, and Mériadacq against the other\r\nDouglas. The chronicler describes the course of the encounter, going\r\ninto much detail, from which one would imagine that there was deadly\r\nperil to life and limb, but no serious hurt was sustained by any of\r\nthe combatants; that fact being that the armour of proof enclosed each\r\nof the fighters in an almost impregnable fortress. La Marche was not\r\npresent at this fight, but got his information from hearsay. Two out\r\nof the Burgundian trio were Chevaliers (Knights), the third combatant\r\nan Escuyer (Esquire), and it is interesting to note the difference\r\nin costume between the two grades. Matthieu de Couci gives it in the\r\nfollowing terms[151]:—Chevaliers “furent revêtus de longues robes de\r\nvelours noir, fourrées de martes zibelines fort riches”; quant au\r\ntroisième qui étoit seulement Escuyer, “il en avoit une seulement de\r\nsatin noir fourrée comme les autres.” King René says the stuff of an\r\nesquire’s costume at his court should be “drap de damas,” and it would\r\nappear generally that an esquire could wear either satin or damask, but\r\nthe chevalier must be clad in velvet. Further regulations were made in\r\n1486, when cloth of gold and cloth of silver came in.\r\n\r\nThe armour of the fifteenth century up to almost its close is usually\r\ntermed “Gothic,” an incongruous appellation, though one convenient to\r\nemploy owing to its having been so generally adopted and understood.\r\nBeyond a few fragments there is no armour of the first half of the\r\ncentury left to us; and for our knowledge of the knightly body-harness\r\nof that period we are mainly indebted to an ample series of monumental\r\neffigies and brasses. Though one cannot draw any decided line, it\r\nmay be said that the process of transition from chain-mail to plate\r\narmour had been practically completed at the commencement of the\r\nfifteenth century; and the progress made in the directions of elegance,\r\ncomprehensiveness and strength had been steady and continuous until\r\ntowards the middle of the century, when we have glorious complete suits\r\nof armour spread out before us.\r\n\r\nThe brass of Sir John Wylcotes, in Great Tew Church, Oxfordshire,\r\ndating about 1410, affords an example of the standard of mail, which\r\nwas a collar worn under a gorget of plate. The figure is without jupon,\r\nso that the breastplate and taces are exposed to view, and they are of\r\nplate; small motons, oval in form, cover the weak places at the armpits.\r\n\r\nThe brass in South Kelsey Church, Lincolnshire, dated about a decade\r\nlater, shows the armour to be much more ornate, having crescent-shaped\r\nmotons, fan-formed wings to the coudes; taces of six lames and short\r\ntuilles; the figure wears a pointed bascinet. The armour on the effigy\r\nin Hoveringham Church, Nottinghamshire, believed to have been ascribed\r\nby Stothart to Sir Robert Grushill, is certainly not of the reign of\r\nRichard II, 1377-1399, but should rather be dated in that of Henry VI.\r\nThere are fluted motons over the armpits, of a curved tooth-like form;\r\ncoudes with elaborate heart-shaped wings; taces of eight narrow lames,\r\nwith short rectangular tuilles, attached to the bottom rims by straps\r\nand buckles. The helmet is still the bascinet. This effigy exhibits an\r\ninstance of the presence of the collar SS. There is an example of this\r\ncollar in the Tower of London.[152] It was found in one of the turrets\r\nof the White Tower in 1913.[153] It is beyond the province of this work\r\nto discuss the probable meaning of these ciphers, which is obscure.\r\n\r\nThe Gothic armour of the connoisseur is reached in the beautiful effigy\r\nof Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, in St. Mary’s Church, Warwick.\r\nIt is cast in laton, a golden looking blend something between bronze\r\nand brass. The earl died in 1439, but the contract for his monument was\r\nnot given out until fifteen years after, so that the type of armour\r\nis later than that of any actual harness worn by the earl. The effigy\r\nexhibits body-armour at its very best, as well in dignity of form as in\r\nbeauty of outline; and if it was not directly copied from a suit made\r\nby Tomaso Missaglai of Milan, the design for it certainly came from\r\nItaly. The breastplate exhibits a deep curved groove on either side; it\r\nis shorter than was usual somewhat later, with a large number of taces;\r\nand there are low neck-guards. Mr. Stothart also gives a back view of\r\nthe figure, showing the armour as completely delineated behind as in\r\nfront. The effigy is depicted on Plate II, giving both a front view and\r\none in profile.\r\n\r\nThe great armour-smiths of the fifteenth century were fine artists in\r\nsteel, and many of their creations preserved are models for all time\r\nin elegance of form and excellence of workmanship. One can trace their\r\nindividuality and idiosyncrasies to an extent making it often possible\r\nto attribute their work even when unstamped with their monograms and\r\ndevices. The Missaglias Negrolis and Piccininos of Milan, the Kolmans\r\nof Augsburg, the Seusenhofers of Innsbruck, the Grünewalts and Von\r\nWorms of Nuremberg, and many others, carried on their craft from\r\ngeneration to generation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE II_ THE BEAUCHAMP EFFIGY]\r\n\r\nDuring the fifteenth century and somewhat later, new modes in armour,\r\nas well as in dress, had their birth in Italy; but they took some time\r\nto travel to other countries less advanced in fashion and refinement.\r\nMuch artistic skill of the highest order was lavished on the enrichment\r\nof armour. Suits were delicately chased, engraved and decorated with\r\nrepoussé work; and artists of the highest celerity were engaged in such\r\nwork. The trapper of mixed mail and plate appears frequently in this\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nA very important paper, printed in _Archæologia_, LVII, by Viscount\r\nDillon, P.S.A., read in 1899, deals with a MS. Collection of Ordinances\r\nof Chivalry of the fifteenth century belonging to Lord Hastings, which\r\ncontains among other matters:—\r\n\r\n    The “Abilment for the Justes of the Pees.”\r\n        “To crie a Justus of Pees.”\r\n        “The comyng into the felde.”\r\n        “To arme a man.”\r\n\r\nThe same manuscript is also commented on by the late Mr. Albert Way in\r\nthe _Archæological Journal_ of 1847.\r\n\r\nTwo of the illuminations depict jousting at the tilt, and another a\r\ncombat on foot with axes before King Henry VI. The fight on foot,\r\nwhich took place in 1442, is between John Astley and Philip Boyle\r\nof Arragon. The lists, enclosed by an open railing, have at one end\r\na stand for the king, who acted as judge, and four steps lead up to\r\nthe tribune. On either side of the steps two men-at-arms are posted,\r\nholding long-shafted axes, and within the lists a herald is standing\r\nwatching the fight. The combatants are wearing globose bascinets, which\r\nwere the usual helmets for foot-fighting. They were roomy enough for\r\nplenty of padding against heavy blows from the axe. Boyle is armed with\r\nan axe having a blade on one side and a _bec de faucon_, or flook, on\r\nthe other; while Astley’s weapon has a _mail_, or mallet, with three\r\nprongs, in place of the flook.\r\n\r\nThe terms of Sir Philip Boyle’s acceptance of the challenge are given\r\nin Lord Dillon’s paper.\r\n\r\nThe first illumination of a joust at the tilt pictures the moment when\r\nthe tilters have shivered their lances, tipped with coronals of three\r\nprongs, on each other’s bodies. The tilt is composed of six planks, and\r\nappears to be between five and six feet in height. Sir John Astley’s\r\ncrest is seen to be a crowned harpy, with torse and mantling; his\r\narmour, the sort termed “tonlet”; the legs and feet are unarmed, being\r\nsufficiently protected by the saddle-steels. The horse is trapped and\r\nhas a chamfron. But little of the person of his adversary can be seen;\r\nwhat there is show his crest, three maidens in a corb, and he also is\r\nwearing bases. Both riders have tilting helms and shields, and bear\r\npoldermitons on their lance-arms. The vamplates are somewhat conical in\r\nform.\r\n\r\nThe other joust pictured is that between Astley and Pierre de Masse,\r\nwhich took place in a street in Paris in the year 1438. It is also\r\nat the tilt. The date is an early one for that form of joust, if the\r\ndrawing be contemporary, which is unlikely. The tilt is composed of\r\nfour planks, and is rather lower than the other example. The jousters\r\nwear no crests on their helms, and they are running with sharp\r\nlances. There are no poldermitons worn in this case. This important\r\nillumination has suffered much from damp, the central figures more\r\nespecially.\r\n\r\nThe articles of combat are given in Lord Dillon’s paper.\r\n\r\nThe “Abilment for the Justus of the Pees,” as reproduced from the\r\nmanuscript belonging to Lord Hastings, is as follows:—\r\n\r\n    “A helme well stuffyd wt a Crest of hys de viis.\r\n     A peyre of platus and xxx Gyders.\r\n     A hanscement for the Bode wt slevis.\r\n     A botton wt a tresse in the platis.\r\n     A schelde coverid wt his deviis.\r\n     A Rerebrace wt a rolle of ledyr well stuffid.\r\n     A Maynfere with a ring.\r\n     A rerebrasce a moton.\r\n     A vambrase and a gaynpayne ＆ ij bricketts.\r\n     And ij dosyn tresses. and vj vamplates.\r\n     And xij Grapers. and xij Cornallis ＆ xl Speris.\r\n     And a Armerer wt a hamor and pynsons.\r\n     And naylys wt a byckorne.\r\n     A Goode Cowrscer and row schode wt a softe bytte.\r\n     And a gret halter for the rayne of the brydyll.\r\n     A Sadyll well stuffud.\r\n     and a peyre of jambus.\r\n     and iij dowbill Gyrthis wt dowbill bokollus.\r\n     and a dowbill sengull wt dowbill bokullus.\r\n     and a rayne of ledir hungre teyyd from the\r\n     horse hede un to the gyrthys be twen the forther\r\n     bowse of the horsce for revassyng. A Rennyng paytrell.\r\n     A croper of leder hongre.\r\n     A Trappar for the Courser.\r\n     And ij servantis on horseback well be sayne.\r\n     And vj servantis on fote all in a sute.”\r\n\r\nThis equipment is for a mounted contest, and differs of course\r\nmaterially from that worn in fighting on foot.\r\n\r\nThe writer of the paper (Lord Dillon) explains such of the terms\r\nemployed as are not fairly obvious. Viscount Dillon’s researches are\r\nmainly embodied in a series of valuable contributions to the pages of\r\n_Archæologia_ and the _Archæological Journal_. Many old records, which\r\nhad not been seen by such excellent authorities as Meyrick and Hewitt,\r\nhave been examined and compared since their day, and they throw much\r\nlight on points and terms which were obscure until recently, and which\r\nhad been misunderstood by the earlier writers to whom we owe so much.\r\n\r\nThe “peyre of platus” is the cuirass, consisting of the breast and back\r\nplates: the “Gyders,” attachments of some kind. The “hanscement” is a\r\nclose-fitting garment, worn beneath the armour. A “botton wt a tresse\r\nin the platis,” probably also refers to fastenings or attachments of\r\nsome kind. The “Rerebrace wt a rolle of ledyr well stuffid” is probably\r\na padding protection for the left upper-arm. The “Maynfere with a\r\nring” is the manifer or mainfaire (main de fer), described in this\r\nwork under the heading of reinforcing pieces. The “rerebrase a moton”\r\nis the rerebrace of the right arm, with its small movable plate, the\r\nmoton or besaguè over the armpit. The “vambrase and gaynpayn and ij\r\nbrickettss,” are the further defences for the right arm and hand. The\r\n“ij dosyn tresses” are arming points, laces for attaching various parts\r\nof the armour together. The “vamplates,” “Grapers,” and “Cornallis” are\r\nthe furniture of the lances, in their order, the conical or circular\r\nsteel hand-guards, metal rings with points which stick into the wooden\r\nblocks in the lance-rests; the coronals, heads of the lance with blunt\r\npoints, calculated to catch on to the armour but not to pierce it.\r\nThe “bycorne” was the anvil. Illustrations of Grapers, later termed\r\n_burres_, are rare. They are present on the illumination of the joust\r\nat the tilt between John Astley and Pierre de Masse, being shown on a\r\nlance standing ready for use when required. They are for distributing\r\nthe force of the shock on impact over the whole body and especially\r\nto lessen the pressure on the wrist; and are placed towards the lower\r\nend of the lance, the space between the graper and the vamplate\r\nconstituting the grip.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the “Abilment” applies to horse furniture.\r\n\r\n             “_To crie a Justus of Pees._”\r\n\r\n      We Herrowdys of Armis beryng scheldis of deviis\r\n    here we yeve in knowlache un to all Gentill men of\r\n    name and of armus.

These consist\r\nof the huge, globose bascinet, the cuirass of breast and back pieces,\r\nthe tonletis, vambrace and rerebrace, a moton for the armpit, and a\r\ngauntlet. The “griffus” mentioned are the greaves; the “tonletis,” the\r\nskirt of bases; and the “pensill” is a small banner.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying text is as follows:—\r\n\r\n      “_How a man schall be armyd at his ese when he schal\r\n                      fighte on foote._”\r\n\r\n      He schal have noo schirte up on him but a dowbelet\r\n    of ffustean lynyd with satene cutte full of hoolis.the\r\n    dowbelet muste be strongeli boūdē there the poyntis\r\n    muste be sette aboute the greet of the arme.and the b\r\n    ste (sic) before and behynde and the gussetis of mayle\r\n    muste be sowid un to the dowbelet in the bought of\r\n    the arme.and undir the arme the armynge poyntis muste\r\n    be made of fyne twyne suche as men make stryngis for\r\n    crossebowes and they muste be trussid small and poyntid\r\n    as poyntis.

Jehan,\r\nSeigneur de Haubourdin, and six others, calling themselves _pélerins_\r\n(pilgrims), were to hold the _pas_ for six weeks against all comers.\r\nThe meeting had been proclaimed in the neighbouring countries; but,\r\nowing to national animosities and other causes prevailing at the time,\r\nonly a single cavalier, and he a German fifty years old, attended\r\nfrom abroad to contest the _pas_. Great preparations had been made:\r\nlists prepared and a tribune, built of stone, erected for the judge.\r\nTwo shields were hung in the lists, one representing Sir Lancelot of\r\nthe Lake, the other Tristan de Leonnois. The German cavalier touched\r\nthe shield of Sir Lancelot, and was given leave to do his devoir in\r\naccordance with the _chapitres d’armes_ drawn up for the occasion. The\r\nduke took his seat on the tribune on the day of combat at 9 a.m., and\r\nsoon afterwards the fight with axes began between the German and the\r\nSire de Haubourdin, who appeared as Sir Lancelot. The German, a tall\r\nman-at-arms, though well up in years, was still vigorous, but not very\r\nexpert at the use of the axe. The number of strokes stipulated in the\r\narticles having been exchanged, without injury to either party, the\r\nduke cast his bâton. No other foreign venant presented himself, to the\r\ngreat disappointment of all concerned. A knight, Bernard de Bearne,\r\nBastard de Foix, had been on his way to contest the _pas_, but had been\r\nstruck down with fever and could not be present in time.\r\n\r\nIn the combat on foot between Jacques de Lalain and the Englishman\r\nnamed Thomas, Lalain fought in light armour, wearing a salade (_sallade\r\nde guerre toute ronde_), leaving his face exposed; while the Englishman\r\nwore heavy armour, his helmet being a visored bascinet. Lalain was\r\narmed with a long-shafted axe, with spikes at the top and bottom,\r\nhaving on one side a _bec de faucon_, or flook, and on the other a\r\nmallet (_mail rond_) with three prongs. The Englishman’s weapon had\r\nan axe-blade on one side, a hammer-head (_long mail_) on the other,\r\nand spikes top and bottom; it had also a roundel guard. After several\r\nstrokes had been exchanged Lalain was wounded on the wrist, in spite of\r\nwhich the fight continued unabated. Thomas then struck some heavy blows\r\nat his adversary, who stepped suddenly back, so that the Englishman\r\nlost his balance and fell heavily to the ground. This ended the fight.\r\n\r\nBernard de Bearne, Bastard de Foix, on recovering from his attack of\r\nfever, presented himself at Bruges, ready to fulfil his engagement\r\nat the _Pas de la Pélerine_; but as the time arranged for the course\r\nof that meeting had expired, the _chapitres d’armes_ prepared for it\r\nhad ceased to operate. Nevertheless, a combat took place at Bruges\r\nwith de Haubourdin, and new articles provided that lances were to be\r\ncast, and then a fight with axes, until one or the other had lost his\r\nweapon. On the day appointed for the duel the Bastard de Foix entered\r\nthe lists, in full armour, the back of his jupon embroidered with the\r\nfamily arms, with the addition of the bâton of illegitimacy. Having\r\npaid his respects to the duke, who acted as umpire, he retired to his\r\npavilion. De Haubourdin came and went in like manner, his jupon bearing\r\nthe cognizance of Sir Lancelot. The champions then re-entered the lists\r\nfor battle, both armed with _becs de faucon_, when it was observed that\r\nthe weapon of de Bearne was garnished with a long, slender spike,\r\ncalculated for easy penetration between the bars of the visor. De\r\nHaubourdin on seeing this had his visor removed, saying that he would\r\nsave his adversary the trouble of piercing it. The combatants each\r\ncarried a lance in the right hand, an axe and shield in the left. The\r\nfight commenced by the parties hurling their lances at each other; that\r\nof de Haubourdin missed his opponent, but de Bearne’s weapon struck\r\nthe shield of his adversary, and glancing off wounded him in the arm.\r\nHurling their shields at each other, the champions then closed, and\r\nafter some heavy strokes had been delivered the duke’s bâton fell.[154]\r\n\r\nDe La Marche thus describes a feat of arms which took place on foot and\r\non horseback between the Seigneur Philippe de Ternant, a Chevalier de\r\nla Toison d’Or, against Galiot de Baltasin, an esquire and chamberlain\r\nto the Duke of Milan, in April, 1446.\r\n\r\nLists of strong planks, with a double enceinte, had been erected in\r\na large square in the town of Arras, near the Hostelerie de la Clef.\r\nThey were spacious in extent, and within them handsome pavilions had\r\nbeen pitched for the use of the combatants, and there were gaily\r\ndecorated stands for the use of the officials and spectators. On the\r\nday appointed Duke Philip of Burgundy took his seat on the tribune on\r\nthe stand overlooking the lists, and with him were his son, the Comte\r\nde Charolais, and his nephew, Adolph de Cléves. On the first day of\r\nthe fighting the Seigneur de Ternant entered the lists on horseback,\r\narmed at all points, accompanied by the Seigneur de Beaujeu and the\r\nComte de Sainct Pol, who acted as his esquires. Dismounting, he paid\r\nhis respects to his master the duke, after which he retired to his\r\npavilion. His adversary entered the lists soon after in like manner,\r\nsupported by the Comte d’Étampes, who presented him to the duke. Eight\r\nmen-at-arms, holding bâtons in their hands, were posted in the lists\r\nin order to be ready to separate the combatants when necessary and to\r\ncarry out the orders of the duke.\r\n\r\nThe usual preliminaries having been gone through, each knight made the\r\nsign of the cross and the first encounter commenced, which was a combat\r\non foot with lances. Baltasin attacked his adversary with such force as\r\nto break the point of his lance; while de Ternant holed the bascinet\r\nof his opponent. The rule as to following up would seem to have been\r\ninfringed by Baltasin, for the king of arms now measured the ground\r\nwith cords and marked the limits of advance and retirement, seven paces\r\neach way. New lances were issued, and in the next round both weapons\r\nwere broken; after which the seven thrusts provided for in the articles\r\nwere duly and gallantly accomplished. The next fight was with estocs\r\nand, after some heavy thrusting, the limits of advance and retreat\r\nwere again marked, this time five paces each way. On the resumption of\r\nthe fight, which is described as terrible, Baltasin’s helmet was again\r\nholed, pieces of armour was shed on both sides and gauntlets broken.\r\nBaltasin then struck de Ternant on the lower end of the right pauldron,\r\nforcing off the coude, and the combatants assailed each other with such\r\nviolence that the points of their estocs were broken off and others had\r\nto be supplied. At length the eleven thrusts were duly and gallantly\r\nperformed and the combatants retired to their pavilions.\r\n\r\nThen came the fight with hammer-headed axes, the heads having three\r\nprongs, _la mail à maniére de trois coings à fendre bois, point\r\nde poincte de dessous_; and the fifteen strokes provided for were\r\nduly accomplished. The champions were then led before the duke, who\r\ncomplimented them on their prowess.\r\n\r\nAfter an interval of a few days the combat on horseback took place.\r\nOn the chamfron of the Italian’s horse was a long spike, which was\r\ndisallowed by the umpire, and the piece was replaced by another.\r\nDe Ternant laid his lance in rest, and his sword was at his belt;\r\nwhile the Italian held his lance with the right hand, his sword and\r\nthe bridle with his left. In the first course De Baltasin evaded\r\nimpact with the lance, but spurred his charger at de Ternant’s horse,\r\napparently with the object of unseating its rider. The Burgundian,\r\nhowever, kept the saddle, and after some further fighting the combat\r\nended without hurt to either party. The action by the Italian was a\r\ncontravention of one of the laws of the tourney, but it was passed over\r\nby the umpire without remark.[155]\r\n\r\nThe first joust of the Comte de Charolais, afterwards Charles the Bold,\r\nthen in his eighteenth year, was run in the park at Brussels in 1452.\r\nHis father, Duke Philip, selected the redoubted champion Jacques de\r\nLalain as the first adversary; and a grand tournament was proclaimed\r\nto take place in Brussels soon after. In the trial course the Comte\r\nand Lalain charged each other, the former breaking his lance on the\r\nshield of his opponent, but Lalain passed without touching him with\r\nhis lance. The duke was much displeased at this, and ordered that in\r\nthe course next following there should be absolute equality between\r\nthe parties; and on the signal being given they charged, each knight\r\nbreaking his lance fairly and well on the other’s body. This time it\r\nwas the duchess who was angry with Lalain, for his dangerous assault\r\non her son. On the day of the tournament at Brussels in the same year\r\nthe Comte de Charolais played his part manfully and well, and in the\r\nevening he was awarded the first prize by the ladies. In the _conte des\r\nfinances_ of 1452 there is an item for 360 livres for his outfit.[156]\r\nThe tournament had been proclaimed throughout the countries of\r\nchivalry, and was held in honour of the eighteenth birthday of the\r\nComte de Charolais, in the Rathhausplatz of the city. Five challengers\r\nheld the field against all comers. Charles ran in eighteen courses, his\r\nadversaries being, Adolph de Cléves, Seigneur de Ravastain; Wolfart de\r\nBorssele; the Earl of Buchan; Messire de Vere; Jean de la Tremoille;\r\nCharles de Ternant; Jacques de Lalain; and the Seigneur de Bugnicourt.\r\n\r\nThe jousting was followed by the quintain, and by a combat on foot.\r\nThe meeting concluded with the _mêlée_, after which the prizes were\r\npresented. It was this _pas d’armes_ that was selected for reproduction\r\nat Brussels in 1905.\r\n\r\nJousting was now frequently combined with masques, mummeries and\r\npageants. The Duke of Cléves was on a visit to his uncle Philip, Duke\r\nof Burgundy, in 1453; and a series of fêtes was held at Lille in his\r\nhonour. During the inaugural banquet a beautiful girl entered the\r\nhall bearing a chaplet of flowers, with which she gracefully crowned\r\nthe duke; and it seems that this was the sign that the entertainment\r\nimmediately following would be given by him. This duly began on the\r\nmorrow, an hour after noon, when a knight of the distinguished order\r\nof the swan issued from the palace, fully armed. It was the Duke of\r\nCléves who was to hold a joust in the market-place at Lille that day;\r\nhe, the tenant, against all comers, being ready to break a lance with\r\nall venans who presented themselves for combat. He was preceded by the\r\nfigure of a gigantic swan, of the size of a horse; the bird, on each\r\nside of which marched a savage in his war-paint, led the knight along\r\nby a chain of gold. The knight was encircled by little angels, and was\r\nfollowed by the duke, who was magnificently dressed. The procession\r\nthus formed marched to the lists, where the knight of the swan tilted\r\nwith the Comte de Charolais, the Comte de St. Pol, Sir Anthony,\r\nBastard of Burgundy, and many others. After the jousting was done the\r\nduke escorted the ladies to the palace, where a banquet was served.\r\nThe hall was gorgeously decorated. Facing the upper table a fountain\r\nplayed, and there was a live lion in the hall. After the company had\r\ntaken their seats a holy friar advanced and addressed the duke, urging\r\nhim to lead his armies against the infidel; and his grace swore that if\r\nthe King of France would engage to leave his dominions in peace he was\r\nready to march with his entire forces in defence of Christendom.[157]\r\n\r\nA tournament was held on the coronation of King Edward IV, at which the\r\nring and ruby were won by Lord Stanley.\r\n\r\nThe following account is given in _Mémoires de la Marche_[158] of the\r\n_pas d’armes_ held by King Edward IV of England in the year 1467, at\r\nWest Smithfield, in which the Bastard of Burgundy took a leading part.\r\nThe narration is here much condensed. King Edward had caused lists\r\nof unusual magnificence to be prepared for the occasion, and costly\r\ngalleries were erected at the sides. The stand for the accommodation of\r\nthe king and his court, his knights and others, was in three stories,\r\na flight of steps leading up to the umpire’s tribune. The knights\r\noccupied the first story; the esquires, the second; and in the third\r\nwere posted the royal archers of the guard. The second erection, lower\r\nthan the other, was occupied by the mayor and aldermen of London,\r\nthe judges, and other persons in authority: and pavilions, richly\r\ndecorated, were pitched for the use of the combatants. In due time the\r\nking ascended the steps of the tribune, preceded by his sword-bearer,\r\nan earl; his majesty was clad in a purple robe and wore the insignia\r\nof the order of the garter; and in attendance was a score or more of\r\nhis counsellors. Chairs were provided for the constable and marshal,\r\nand the king took his seat on the tribune as judge. The constable’s\r\nguard of eight men-at-arms then entered the lists and took up their\r\npositions, when a knocking was heard at the gate. It was a knight who\r\nknocked, and the constable asked to know his purpose. “My name,” said\r\nthe knight, “is Escallis,[159] and I am come to accomplish a deed of\r\narms with the Bastard of Burgundy, and demand entrance into the lists\r\nto do my _devoir_.” Permission having been accorded, the knight entered\r\nthe lists in full armour, and was followed by ten or a dozen horses,\r\nrichly caparisoned, led by pages; and after making his obeisance to\r\nthe sovereign he retired to his pavilion. The Bastard of Burgundy then\r\nentered the lists in a like manner, accompanied by the Duke of Suffolk,\r\nwho had been deputed by the king to attend him; and in his train were\r\ntwelve horses, trapped in cloth of gold and velvet, with the arms of\r\nBurgundy and the bâton of illegitimacy embroidered upon them. After\r\npaying his compliments to the king he also retired to his pavilion.\r\nBoth knights re-entered the lists for battle, their lances were handed\r\nto them, and they took up positions for their careers. The onset being\r\nsounded they placed their lances in rest and charged towards each\r\nother, meeting in the centre of the lists, without injury to either\r\nparty; then drawing their swords they attacked each other with great\r\nfury. Lord Scales, spurring up his horse, dashed violently against that\r\nof his adversary, the shock of the collision bearing the Burgundian and\r\nhis charger to the ground, where the Bastard lay with his horse upon\r\nhim. The officials of the lists raised up the fallen champion, when it\r\nwas found that he had not sustained any serious injury. The king was\r\nannoyed at this incident; Lord Scales, however, pleaded that it was the\r\nfreshness of his horse which had caused the accident. This put an end\r\nto the fighting for the day, and the Bastard retired to his lodgings,\r\nwhere he was afterwards visited by the constable with a message of\r\nsympathy and enquiry from the king, and an expression of regret at the\r\naccident. “Thank the king,” replied the bastard, “and tell him that\r\nto-day I have fought with a beast, but to-morrow I will engage a man.”\r\n\r\nThe champions joined in a combat on foot the next day, with spears,\r\naxes and daggers, the fight to continue until one or other should be\r\ndisarmed or borne to the ground. It had been arranged that spears\r\nshould be cast, but on the king objecting that part of the proceedings\r\nwas omitted. The fight then began. Lord Scales dealt the Bastard some\r\nheavy strokes with his axe, and the Bastard, attacking with great\r\nviolence, seriously fractured the armour of his adversary, at which\r\nstage of the combat the king cast his bâton.\r\n\r\nDe la Marche was present at the fight.\r\n\r\nOther contests took place on the following day; but on intelligence\r\narriving of the death of Duke Philippe le Bon, of Burgundy, the meeting\r\nbroke up.\r\n\r\nMonstrelet states that the lists were 370 feet long by 250 feet broad,\r\nand gives a somewhat different account of the mounted combat. He\r\nsays that the jousting was with pointed lances, and further that the\r\nchamfron of the horse of Lord Scales was garnished with a long steel\r\nspike, which, being thrust into the mouth of the Bastard’s charger,\r\ncaused the animal such pain that it reared and at length fell, with its\r\nrider, the Burgundian, underneath.\r\n\r\nHolinshed’s version[160] is as follows:—\r\n\r\n      “The first daie they ran togither diurse courses with\r\n    sharpe speares, and departed with equall honer. The\r\n    next day they turneied on horsseback. The lord Scales\r\n    horsse had on his chafron a long sharpe pike of steele,\r\n    and as the two champions coped togither, the same\r\n    horsse (whether through custome or by chance), thrust\r\n    his pike into the nosethrils of the bastard’s horsse;\r\n    so that for verie paine he mounted so high, that he\r\n    fell on the one side with his maister, and the lord\r\n    Scales rode round about him with his sword in his hand,\r\n    vntill the King commanded the marshall to helpe vp the\r\n    bastard, which openlie said ‘I cannot hold me by the\r\n    clouds, for though my horse faileth me, surelie I will\r\n    not fail my counter-companion.’”\r\n\r\nThe king would not suffer them to do any more that day. On the morrow\r\nthe champions fought with pole-axes, when at length the point of the\r\naxe wielded by Lord Scales was thrust into the sight of the Bastard’s\r\nhelm with such force that it brought him to his knees, on which the\r\nking cast his bâton. The Bastard wished to fight again, but the umpire\r\nruled that should the encounter be continued it could only recommence\r\nat the stage reached at the termination of the last combat, with the\r\nBastard on his knees. On hearing this judgment the Bastard relinquished\r\nhis challenge.\r\n\r\nAn Ashmolean MS. (111-3b) furnishes the following[161]:—“A demonstracōn\r\nby John Writh alias Garter, to King Edward the Fourth, touching three\r\nKnyghtes of high Almayn wch came to do arms in England, with the\r\ninstruccōns by them geven unto the saide Gartr and the articles of\r\ntheir feates and enterprise.” The year must have been 1473.\r\n\r\nThe blending of the tourney with the pageant, mummeries and buffoonery\r\ncontinued to gain ground, and the sumptuous and costly fêtes held at\r\nBruges in 1468, on the occasion of the marriage of Charles of Burgundy\r\nwith Margaret of York, sister to King Edward IV of England, afford an\r\nexcellent example of these combinations. All is minutely described at\r\ngreat length by de la Marche.[162] He gives details of the dresses,\r\nceremonial and armour, and full particulars of each joust; he also\r\nnames the historic personages taking part. The plot of the leading\r\npageant, if it can be called a plot, is inconsequent, though staged\r\nwith great splendour and elaboration. There were tableaux of the Twelve\r\nLabours of Hercules, and many allegorical representations.\r\n\r\nLists were erected in the Grande Place, and just within them stood\r\n_l’arbre d’or_, a great fir-tree, the trunk of which was gilded over,\r\nand it was this tree which lent its name to the fête. The Bastard of\r\nBurgundy and Adolf de Cléves, Seigneur de Ravastain, cousin-german to\r\nthe duke, assumed the rôle of Chevaliers de L’Arbre d’Or, and they were\r\nto hold the _pas_ in its defence. The fêtes were arranged to extend\r\nover ten days. On the first day the duke took his seat on the tribune,\r\nand a “poursuivant-at-armes,” clad in the livery of _l’arbre d’or_,\r\nhanded him a letter from the princess of an unknown isle, in which she\r\nproffers her favour to any knight who would deliver a certain giant\r\nfrom captivity, whom she had placed under the guardianship of her\r\ndwarf. The dwarf, gaily dressed in crimson and white satin, now entered\r\nthe arena, leading in the giant by a chain, and, binding him to the\r\ngolden tree, took up a position on a flight of steps, with a trumpet\r\nand sand-glass in his hands. The dwarf then sounded a note on his\r\ntrumpet, and turned the sand-glass, which was timed for half an hour,\r\nat the expiration of which Adolf de Cléves, as Chevalier de L’Arbre\r\nd’Or, who was to open the _pas_, knocked at the gate of the lists,\r\nand the pursuivant demanded his name and errand. “I am come,” said\r\nhe, “to accomplish the adventure of the giant, and demand admission.”\r\nThe blazon of his arms having been submitted to the judge it was hung\r\nsuspended on the tree, and the dwarf admitted him. De Ravastain was\r\nborne into the lists in a litter, carried on the backs of two black\r\nhorses, and made a brilliant entrance with his team of drummers and\r\ntrumpeters on the march; his robe was of velvet, the colour of leather,\r\ntrimmed with ermine, and on his head was a cardinal’s hat. His handsome\r\ncharger, richly caparisoned, bore a pair of panniers on his back,\r\nbetween which a court fool was seated, and it followed the litter, led\r\nby a varlet. The duchess was seated on her tribune, and the chevalier,\r\nthrowing away his hat, knelt down before her and set forth the details\r\nof the rôle he had assumed, praying for her permission to carry out\r\nhis plan. This being graciously accorded, he retired to his pavilion\r\nto arm him, re-entering the lists on horseback. The dwarf then gave\r\nthe signal for the jousting, and the venans, sumptuously arrayed and\r\nbrilliantly attended, were successively disposed of. After they had\r\nbeen dealt with, the dwarf again blew his trumpet and the prize was\r\npresented to de Cléves. The cavaliers then jousted each with a _gros\r\nplanchon blanc_, but without touching each other; and the first day’s\r\nproceedings finished with a banquet. Jousts of different kinds, dinners\r\nand entertainments continued over each succeeding day of the fêtes.\r\nOn the sixth day the Bastard of Burgundy had his leg nearly broken;\r\non the eighth the Sire Philippe de Poictiers was wounded; and on the\r\nninth day Duke Charles jousted with his kinsman, de Ravastain, breaking\r\neight spears to eleven by his opponent. The prize was a _destrier_,\r\nrichly accoutred, provided with panniers, and in them was an entire\r\njousting equipment of the Bastard of Burgundy. The prize was won by the\r\nSire de Arguel, who had broken thirteen lances on the third day of the\r\nfêtes. In keeping account of the splintered lances, the _articles du\r\npas_ determine how they shall be broken:—“_car nulles lances ne furent\r\ntenues pour rompues, s’il n’y avoit quatre doigts de franc au-dessous\r\ndu roquet, ou devant la grape_.” The lances for every contest were\r\nalways carefully measured before being used, so that they were of equal\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nThe lists were cleared of the tilt and stands, and the _mêlée_ began,\r\nthere being twenty-five cavaliers on each side. They fought with\r\nrebated swords, and with such ardour that all signals to stop were\r\ndisregarded, and it was only when the duke rode in among them unhelmed,\r\nsword in hand, that they could be induced to cease fighting and go and\r\nprepare for the banquet which was to follow.\r\n\r\nPhilip de Commenes was present and tilted with Jerom of Cambrai. The\r\nbanquet was served on a splendid scale, and the side tables were\r\ncuriously embellished. On one of the dishes was the figure of a unicorn\r\nthe size of a horse, with a leopard on his back waving the banner of\r\nEngland in one hand, and holding in the other a _fleur de marguerite_.\r\nThe unicorn was trapped in silk, on which were embroidered the arms of\r\nEngland. A _fleur de marguerite_ was presented to the duke by the hand\r\nof a little female dwarf belonging to Marie of Burgundy. The dwarf was\r\ndressed as a shepherdess, in cloth of gold, and was mounted on a huge\r\nlion, bearing the arms of Burgundy, which opened its mouth by means of\r\nsprings, and chanted a poem in honour of the beautiful shepherdess.\r\nThere were many more mechanical contrivances; and on the last day\r\nof the fêtes a whale sixty feet long entered the hall, escorted by\r\ntwo giants. The whale wagged its tail and fins; its eyes were great\r\nmirrors, and when it opened its mouth sirens issued from it, chanting\r\nmost melodiously. After further conceits the two giants were swallowed\r\nby the whale.\r\n\r\nA copy of a very quaint manuscript, portions of it written at\r\ndifferent times in the reign of Edward IV and up to that of Henry\r\nVIII, is given in _Archæologia_ of the year 1846. It describes the\r\nmarriage ceremony and the pageants, remarking as to the latter:—“the\r\npageantes wear so obscure, that I fere me to writ or speke of them,\r\nbecause all was cuntenaunce and no wordes.”\r\n\r\nAs to the excitement of the _mêlée_ and the disregard of the signals\r\nand commands to cease fighting, the MS. says:—“the Duke unhelmed hyme,\r\nand with a great staffe his person charged pece in paine of deth, and\r\nsoe wt great labore he droffe the parties asounder.”\r\n\r\nThere was not much tourneying at the court of Burgundy after this,\r\nfor Duke Charles was too busily and constantly engaged in military\r\nenterprises against his neighbours; and, indeed, his ambitious,\r\npredatory and headstrong career was fast drawing to a close, ending,\r\nin fact, in 1477 on the fatal field of Nancy. The jousting traditions\r\nof his house passed over through his daughter, his only child, to\r\nthe Austrian and German courts, under Maximilian: and it is to these\r\ncountries, more especially, to which we must now turn for the history\r\nof the tournament in its decline.\r\n\r\nIn the same year as the fêtes at Bruges, 1468, a joust was held in\r\nfront of the king’s hotel at the Tournelles, Paris; the challengers\r\nagainst all comers being four gentlemen of the company of the Seneschal\r\nof Normandy. John Raquier hastened from Rouen to take part, and he\r\nbroke five lances with distinction; then came Marc Senamy and two sons\r\nof Sir John Sanguin, who all acquitted themselves well, after whom\r\nCharles de Louviers, cup-bearer to the king, jousted successfully, and\r\nthe prize of the day was adjuged to him. After all these encounters the\r\ntenans were much bruised, two of them carried their arms in slings and\r\na third was severely wounded in the hand; so that the honours of the\r\nmeeting lay with the venans.[163]\r\n\r\n      “At the marriage of Richard, duke of York, son of\r\n    Edward IV, with Ann Mowbray, daughter to the duke of\r\n    Norfolk in 1477, six gentlemen challenged all comers at\r\n    the _Just Roial_, with _helme_ and _shield_,\r\n    in manner accustomed.\r\n\r\n      “Secondly, To runne in _Ostling[164] harneis_ alonge\r\n    a tilte.\r\n\r\n      “And thirdly, to strike certaine strokes with swoards\r\n    and guise of _torney_.”[165]\r\n\r\nA narrative by an eye-witness of this marriage and “of the grand\r\njusting then celebrated” is given in the Ashmolean MS. No. 856,\r\n94-104,[166] which is at least as curious as the account of the\r\njousting of Anthony Lord Scales with the Bastard of Burgundy. It was\r\npublished by W. H. B. in the _Excerpta Historica_, in June, 1830.\r\n\r\n      “In the reign of Henry VII certaine gentlemen who\r\n    stiled themselves servants of Ladie Maie, in honour\r\n    of that month, gave a challenge to be performed at\r\n    Greenwiche; the articles run thus:—\r\n\r\n      “_Imprimis_, The fourteenth daie of Maie, shall be\r\n    redye in the field certaine gentlemen, perteyning to\r\n    the Ladye Maie, armed for the tilt, in harneis therunto\r\n    accustomed; and there to kepe the fielde (in such place\r\n    as it shall please the kynge to appoint) from 2 of the\r\n    clocke, til 5 at the afternoone, to run with every\r\n    commer 8 courses; and thus the answerers all answered\r\n    and served, that than if there be any that desireth for\r\n    their Ladyes sake other 4 courses, it shall be granted,\r\n    so the hower be not past, if it be then at the queenes\r\n    pleasure.\r\n\r\n      “The second day, to shoot Standart Arrowe and fighte,\r\n    with all commers; he that shootes the standart furthest\r\n    to have a prise, and so in like case of the arrows of\r\n    the flight.\r\n\r\n      “The third day with swordes rebated (without points\r\n    or edges) to strike with any commer 8 strokes in way of\r\n    pleasure; and four strokes more for any of the commers\r\n    mistress sake, under the above restrictions, (and the\r\n    queen’s pleasure).\r\n\r\n      “The fourth day to wrestle all manner of ways.\r\n\r\n      “The fifth day, armed to fighte on foote, with\r\n    speares in their hands rebated, and then swordes by\r\n    their sides for the battle; and then with speare and\r\n    sworde to defend their barriers; that is to say, with\r\n    spears 8 strokes, whereof two with foyne (thrusts) and\r\n    6 strokes; and that done, to drawe their swordes and\r\n    strike 8 strokes every man, to his best advantage, with\r\n    gripe or otherwise; and four strokes for a lady, under\r\n    the above restrictions.\r\n\r\n      “The sixth day to cast the barre on foote, and with\r\n    the arme both heavie and light.\r\n\r\n      “At these _tournois_ the challenger doth engage\r\n    to come in _harneis_ for the tilt, without targe or\r\n    brockett, _woalant piece over the head_,[167] rondall\r\n    over the garde, rest of advantage, fraude, deceit, or\r\n    other malengine.\r\n\r\n      “And some time after four gentlemen challenged all\r\n    commers at Greenwich: To the feate called barriers,\r\n    with the casting speare, and the targatt and the\r\n    bastarde sworde.[168] And one cast with the speare\r\n    hedded with the morn (coronal), and 17 strokes with\r\n    the sworde, point and edge rebated; without close or\r\n    griping one another with handes, upon paine of such\r\n    punishment, as the judges for the tyme being should\r\n    thinke requisite.”\r\n\r\n“The tilts, we find, were performed with long tilting spears, on\r\nhorseback; and when their lances were broken, they often took to\r\ntheir swords as well as axes”: see the method of challenge in the\r\ndescription of the plates in the life of Earl Warwick, and the manner\r\nof performing, Plates 35, 36, ＆ 37, etc.[169]\r\n\r\nCaxton, writing in the reign of Edward IV, in his epilogue to _The book\r\nof the Order of Chyvalry and Knyghthode_, says:—\r\n\r\n      “I wold it pleasyd our soverayne Lord that twyes or\r\n    thryes in a yere, or at least ones, he wold do crye\r\n    _Justes of pees_, to thende that every knyght shold\r\n    have hors and haryneys, and also the use and craft of\r\n    a knyght, and also to torneye one ageynste one, or ij\r\n    ageynst ij; and the best to have a prys, a dyamond,\r\n    or jewel, such as shold please the prynce. Thys shold\r\n    cause gentylmen to resorte to thauncyent customes of\r\n    chyvalry, to grate fame and renōmee, and also to be\r\n    alway redy to serve theyr prynce when he shalbe calle\r\n    them or have nede.”\r\n\r\nA superb representation on tapestry of a _mêlée_ which took place late\r\nin the fifteenth century, worked at Malines, is now at Valenciennes;\r\nand it is remarkable for its technical accuracy. The jousting is over;\r\nand a combat with sharp swords in progress. Broken lances, a helmet, a\r\nbroken helm, fragments of crests, _grelots_ and other debris shed in\r\nthe contest lie on the ground among the horse’s hoofs. The helmets are\r\narmets of the older form, of which there are existing examples spread\r\nover the collections of Europe. This type has hinged side-pieces and\r\nopens out from the middle for inserting and withdrawing the head of\r\nthe wearer; and it is fastened together with a leathern strap. There\r\nis a small circular disk projecting from the back of the helmet,\r\nas well as a collar in front and over the neck behind, to which a\r\nnecklet of chain-mail is fixed by a line of rivets. The comb of the\r\nhelmet is holed for the attachment of a crest and the visor projects\r\nin a sort of beak. The disk is fixed to one side of the back of the\r\nhead-piece by a thin iron connecting pin or bar. Its use or purpose\r\nis difficult to imagine and has given rise to much controversy, but\r\nnone of the explanations advanced are at all convincing, for the bar\r\nor connecting pin is too slender to protect the neck from a sword\r\nstroke or even to shield from injury the strap at the back which holds\r\nthe helmet together. This type fell into disuse at the commencement\r\nof the sixteenth century. The armour shown on the figures is fairly\r\nuniform. A long mail shirt with sleeves is worn, and it is much less\r\ncovered with plate than might be expected at the end of the fifteenth\r\ncentury. The forms of the pauldrons, neck-guards, globose breastplate,\r\n“bear-paw,” or “cow-mouth” sollerets (as they were called), tuilles,\r\ntassets, and bases all mark the period, which other historic features\r\non the tapestry confirm. Motons appear on only one of the figures, and\r\nthey are pear-shaped; in the case of the other front figures there is\r\nno defence for the armpits beyond the chain-mail shirt. The lances are\r\nboth grooved and plain, the vamplates, circular. An unusual feature\r\nis the presence of three long, narrow, label-shaped plates or bars,\r\nridged down the middle, with small circular eyes at the tops, through\r\nwhich screws or rivets are passed, attaching them to the back rim of\r\nthe armet. The back-plates are low, reaching but half-way up, and these\r\nthree plates or bars form the only defence for the upper back outside\r\nthe mail shirts. They appear to be adjustable to a certain extent. The\r\nmiddle plate is the longest of the three, extending down the spine of\r\nthe wearer to over the top of the low back-plate; while the side-bars,\r\nequal in length, reach well over the pauldron wings. The horses are all\r\nbarded in leather, with chamfrons and crinets apparently of iron; and\r\nnone of the animals are trapped. The bridles are of chain-mail, framed\r\nin iron. The tapestry measures 4·70 m. to 5·60 m. in size, and part of\r\nit is shown on Plate I (2).\r\n\r\nIn the year 1487 Johannes, Duke of Saxony, ran in _Gestech_ with Cuntz\r\nMetzschen at Jena, and both riders kept their seats. They wore armour\r\nsuch as described in Plate IX (1): the motons were very ornate. On the\r\nduke’s helm were two small black flags, on which the letter “M” was\r\nembroidered, in honour of his wife, Sophie of Mecklenburg. His trapper\r\nand shield were black, with violet, yellow, and white stripes.\r\n\r\nA “Solemne Triumphe” was held at Richmond, which lasted a whole month,\r\nat which Sir James Parker was killed, in 1494.[170]\r\n\r\nThe two most important armouries are those at Vienna and Madrid; but\r\nfor the study of the tourney that at Dresden is the best. Indeed, much\r\nof the armour there has remained, practically _in situ_, since it was\r\nin use, and many of the harnesses can be attributed with certainty,\r\nboth as regards wearers and makers. In the _Tournierwaffensaal_\r\nseveral of the mounted models have sat their horses since the year\r\n1591. At Dresden may be seen examples of the saddles, horse muzzles,\r\nweapons, bards and trappers; and even the textile costumes worn over\r\nand under the armour, as well as the small accessories and tools, may\r\nbe studied. Besides these armouries, those at Paris, Berlin, Turin,\r\nNuremberg, the Tower of London, and the Wallace Collection, are large\r\nand comprehensive.\r\n\r\nThe German _Turnierbücher_ and jousting in Germany will be dealt with\r\nin the next chapter.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[139] _Mémoirs de la Marche_, Liv.

In France the subject has received but\r\nscant attention in recent times.\r\n\r\nThe contemporary literature in France and England concerning the\r\ntournament of the sixteenth century is much less voluminous than that\r\nwritten in the fifteenth, and the narrations of chroniclers greatly\r\nlack that technical knowledge which characterizes the work of their\r\npredecessors, who belonged to a higher class of society. The contrast,\r\nindeed, in their treatment of these meetings is very marked, in that\r\ncomparatively little attention is devoted by the later writers to the\r\nmartial sports themselves, while the pageantry and dresses closely\r\nconnected with them absorb most of the matter of their narrations.\r\nThis is perhaps an indication of a diminished public interest in\r\nthe tournament in these countries; and but for the fuller and more\r\ncircumstantial German records it would be difficult to present any\r\ncomprehensive account of its ramifications during the sixteenth\r\ncentury and to the time when it fell into disuse. There are many\r\nrecords relating to the tournament in the College of Arms, London,\r\nand among the Ashmolean, Harleian and Cottonian MSS.[171]; whilst the\r\n_Chronicles_ of Hall and Holinshed also afford much information. De\r\nPluvinal, in _Maneige Royal_, published in 1625, gives some interesting\r\nparticulars of jousting in its later stages, and Ménestrier, in _Traité\r\ndes Tournois, Jousts, Carrousels, &c._, when it had almost ceased being\r\npractised.\r\n\r\nThe institution had attained its highest development in most of the\r\ncountries of chivalry in the first half of the fifteenth century, and\r\nthe sixteenth saw its rapid decline. It had become more and more a\r\nmere sport and pastime, and had lost much of its former dignity in\r\nbeing so closely associated with mummeries and the pageant. All the\r\nsafeguards instituted in the fifteenth century had become accentuated\r\nin the sixteenth to a degree making serious accidents very rare; and\r\nthe introduction of barriers in combats on foot, and the employment\r\nof lances in these contests, apart from the preliminary casting, so\r\noften described in the narrations of such encounters of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, had greatly changed their character, and made them much less\r\ndangerous.\r\n\r\nIn admitting cavaliers to the tournament kings of arms were particular\r\nto exclude all who were not of noble birth, with the requisite number\r\nof descents. The bâton of illegitimacy, however, was no bar to the\r\nadmission of the bastards of princely houses, who were generally\r\naccepted in society on an apparently equal footing with nobles of the\r\nhighest rank.\r\n\r\nThe prizes awarded were often a wreath, a ring, a sword, helmet, jewel\r\nor a charger; at a joust held at Weimar in 1534 they consisted of a\r\nspur, a sword and a lady’s slipper, all of gold.\r\n\r\nMany new forms of jousting were introduced in Germany late in the\r\nfifteenth and during the sixteenth centuries, though most of them\r\nwere derived from three main courses with but trivial differences\r\nfrom them. Some of the variants were conceived with a view to the\r\nintroduction of some striking or humorous novelty; and, in fact, the\r\npassion for theatrical effect then prevailing in Germany, brought about\r\nsome extraordinary mechanical absurdities as applied to jousting. The\r\nintricacies of the various courses would seem to have been somewhat\r\nperplexing even to the generations by whom they were practised, and\r\nthey are, of course, much more difficult to disentangle now.\r\n\r\nIt was in Germany that the bulk of the jousting harnesses of the\r\nsixteenth century were made, and in that country the contemporary\r\nliterature over the period in question concerning the tournament is\r\nmost considerable.\r\n\r\nThe tournament records of the emperor Maximilian I and those of the\r\nruling princes of the German Empire are of the first importance in\r\nthe history of the tournament of the period, for it was at the courts\r\nof these sovereigns that such sports were most practised in their\r\nvarious phases, and when they reached their greatest development.\r\nThe tournament, with its attendant pageants and mummeries, played a\r\nleading part in the weekly routine of the relaxation and amusements\r\nof these princes and their chivalry, a part perhaps second only to\r\nthe chase; and these records bring the actual details of the various\r\ncourses vividly before us in the many carefully executed drawings\r\nrepresenting them which have been preserved. Most of them deal with the\r\ntournament of the sixteenth century, though some of the combats of the\r\nlast quarter of the fifteenth are recorded and illustrated; and while,\r\nperhaps, none of the drawings are strictly speaking contemporaneous\r\nwith the events they depict many of them were copied from older\r\npictures, so that taken as a whole the details given are more reliable\r\nthan most of the other sources of information.\r\n\r\nThe most precious among these tourney-books is the _Freydal_ of\r\nMaximilian I, a work of the year 1515, in which the emperor’s combats\r\nin the lists, with the accompanying mummeries, are pictured.\r\n\r\nThe allegorical name “Freydal” is one of those assumed by the emperor\r\nin his knightly character. Maximilian was born in 1459, elected emperor\r\nin 1494, and died in 1520. He began his jousting career when quite\r\na youth, and took a leading and personal part in the compilation\r\nof _Freydal_, dictating some of the text to his secretary Max\r\nTrytssaurwein in 1511; and, indeed, he corrected some of the proofs\r\nwith his own hand. He selected for the book the examples of the various\r\ncourses in which he was engaged, in almost all of which he appears as\r\nthe victor. These instructions as to the choice of the subjects of the\r\nplates are of great value to the student, and are given in Appendix\r\nD. The personal character of the work adds much to its interest and\r\nimportance in the history of the tournament.\r\n\r\nThe admirable reproduction of _Freydal_ by Querin von Leitner, issued\r\nunder the directions of Franz, Grafen Folliot De Grenneville,[172]\r\nleaves little to be desired. There are 255 plates arranged in series of\r\n_Rennen_, _Stechen_, foot combats and a _mêlée_, all depicting courses\r\nin which Maximilian had “_gerennt_, _gestochen_ und _gekämpft_.”[173]\r\nThe work is valuable from many points of view, for it includes a\r\nregister of the prominent personages of the time, and full particulars\r\nof the colours, trappers, arms and crests of the cavaliers taking part,\r\ntogether with the costumes of the mummers and others, besides some\r\ngenealogical notes.\r\n\r\n_Freydal_ is one of a series of chronicles somewhat similar in\r\ncharacter, comprising _Theuerdank_, _Weisskünig_, _Triumph of\r\nMaximilian_ and _Ehrenpforte_; all were written with a view to the\r\nglorification of the emperor and his reign. _Freydal_ is the emperor’s\r\ntestament to posterity of his career in the tiltyard, and, with the\r\naccompanying mummeries he initiated, forms a knightly tribute to the\r\nmemory of his much lamented consort Mary of Burgundy. A poem in the\r\nwork follows, which illustrates the spirit of vanity and the somewhat\r\nfrivolous character of the monarch:—\r\n\r\nRITTER FREYDALB[174]\r\n\r\n    Nun ver von kurtzweil lesen wil\r\n    Vnd lustbarlichen dingen,\r\n    der nem fur sich die ritterspil,\r\n    da ainr nach eer thut ringen,\r\n    als ritter Freydalb hat gethon\r\n    Aus ritterlichem gmute\r\n    Auf mengen adelichen plon.\r\n    Sein tugent vnd auch gute\r\n    ist allermenigelich offenbar,\r\n    wie er konndt tryumphiern\r\n    mit rennen, stechen kempfen zwar\r\n    Auch tantzen vnd thurniern\r\n    damit er in sein jungen tagen,\r\n    Als ir hie horen werden\r\n    grose freyd ynd ruem do hat erjagen,\r\n    (Seins gleich lebt nit auf erden).\r\n\r\n_Theuerdank_ is a narration of Maximilian’s journey to Ghent to wed the\r\nheiress of Charles the Bold, with an account of his adventures by the\r\nway, and the story of his courtship. It was written by the emperor for\r\nthe instruction of Charles V when a youth. There are 117 wood-cuts by\r\nHans Schaufflein.\r\n\r\n_Weisskünig_ is the story of his life and government.\r\n\r\n_The Triumph_ describes the progress and achievements of his reign, as\r\ntypified by the picture of the triumphal car running through it. It\r\nwas written in 1512, greatly at the emperor’s own dictation; and the\r\nillustrations depict jousters fully equipped for some of the various\r\ncourses of the tournament.\r\n\r\n_The Ehrenpforte_ is a monument to the glory of the Emperor’s name and\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nIn the tourney-book of Maximilian belonging to the Prince of\r\nHohenzollern-Sigmaringen the spirited illustrations are by the hand\r\nof Hans Burgmaier, of Augsburg, an able coadjutor of the great\r\narmour-smith Koloman Colman of the same city, surnamed Helmschmidt.\r\n\r\nOf great interest and importance are the three original tourney books\r\nof the Saxon Electors—Johanns _des Beständigen_, Johann Friedrichs _des\r\nGrozmüthigen_, and August, scoffingly called by Carlyle, if we remember\r\nrightly, the _physically_ strong. They are in three volumes, which are\r\npreserved in the public library at the Japanese Palace, Dresden. The\r\nillustrations, which number over 300, are water-colour drawings on\r\nparchment, and they depict the courses of _Rennen_, _Stechen_,[175] and\r\na _mêlée_, as run by those princes during their reigns; they afford\r\ncharacteristic records of these knightly sports from the year 1487 to\r\n1566. The earlier jousts of the _Kurfürst_ Johann begin towards the end\r\nof the fifteenth century, the others following in the sixteenth; while\r\nthe third volume, executed in 1584, includes fifty-five drawings of the\r\ncourses of _Scharfrennen_ and _Gestech_ run by the _Kurfürst_ August,\r\nthe last taking place in February, 1566, at Dresden. The drawings are\r\nby Heinrich Göding, of Brunswick, the court painter, and many of them\r\nwould seem to have been copied from an earlier work.\r\n\r\nThere is also an old copy of one of the books in the royal library at\r\nVeste Coburg. Professor Haenel, the Curator of the Johanneum Collection\r\nof Arms and Armour at Dresden, has reproduced a selection of the plates\r\nin the three volumes of the joustings of the Saxon _Kurfürsts_, two of\r\nthem coloured as in the originals, the others plain (published under\r\nthe auspices of _Die Verein für historische Waffenkunde_, Dresden,\r\n1910). The book supplies a long-felt want, for the original volumes are\r\nnot easy of access.\r\n\r\nIn the _Gewehrgalerie_ at the Johanneum, Dresden,[176] are twenty-nine\r\npaintings in oils by the same artist as those in the tourney-books,\r\nand they depict courses run in _Scharfrennen_ by the _Kurfürsts_.\r\nThese pictures are of even greater value than the drawings in the\r\ntourney-books in being painted on a larger scale, and giving more\r\ndetails both of the courses themselves and the general surroundings of\r\nthe lists. One of them, like the last picture in the tournament-book,\r\nVol. III, depicts the last joust of the _Kurfürst_ August, run against\r\nhis ennobled master-armourer Hans Dehn, in the year 1566; and it bears\r\nthe title, “_Ein Rennen mit Hannss Dehnen gethan, der ist alleine\r\ngefallen. Ao 66 im Februar zu Dressten an der Festnacht_.” This\r\noil-painting is hung in a bad light, and is darkened by age, but a\r\nclose examination reveals the fact that the riders and horses are only\r\nmodels, stuffed with straw, their hoofs attached to low four-wheeled\r\nbogies. The figures are impelled to charge by a mechanical apparatus;\r\nropes, running along the bogies and beyond, are visible, but the\r\nmachinery itself for setting the models in motion is hidden from view.\r\nThese models, as stated on the picture, formed part of a Carnival\r\nmummery, held at court. The painting exhibits the moment when Hans\r\nDehn is in the act of being hurled from his horse by the _Kurfürst_,\r\nhis lance falling to the ground; while the prince is holding up his\r\nleft hand in the manner customary after impact. The _Kurfürst_ wears a\r\njousting-salade, with a crest of plumes; the usual shield; bases and\r\njousting-cuisses. The legs and feet are unarmoured. The lance is stout,\r\nrounded, adorned with puffs, and headed with a small conically formed\r\nsharp tip; the vamplate is very large. The horse bears an enriched\r\ncollar and a spiked chamfron, while plumes adorn the head and tail. The\r\nsaddle is without cantle, the object of the course being unhorsing; the\r\ntrapper, reaching down to the horse’s houges, is painted with stars,\r\nfoliations and the arms (viz. a lion _rampant_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE III_\r\n\r\nMAXIMILIAN I ENGAGED IN _HOHENZEUGGESTECH_]\r\n\r\nAbout the end of the seventeenth century the models of horses used for\r\nthe display of armour in the Tower of London were mounted on casters,\r\nand guide books of the period and later state that they had been\r\nemployed in practising tilting and running at the ring. This could\r\nhardly have been the case as regards these particular models, their\r\npurpose having been doubtless merely for convenience in moving and\r\ncleaning. These statements were, however, founded on the fact that\r\nthere had been horses fitted with mechanical contrivances for impelling\r\nthem forward towards one another for the purpose of practising the\r\njoust and its kindred military sports. In the years 1672 and 1673\r\npatents were taken out in England for models of horses fitted with\r\nmechanical appliances for the purpose in question,[177] and the joust\r\nat Dresden on Twelfth-night, 1566, shows that they were not confined to\r\nthis country.\r\n\r\nThe subjects of the paintings and embroideries on trappers in the\r\nsixteenth century were often humorous, religious, and sometimes even\r\npolitical in character. An example shows a barrel of gunpowder in the\r\nact of explosion and a pair of sweethearts standing before it kissing.\r\nAnother exhibits a man standing in the street, clad only in his shirt,\r\nbeing well soused with water thrown from an open window. A religious\r\nexample deals with the struggle in progress between the propaganda of\r\nreform as against the Church of Rome, wherein a monk and a Lutheran\r\ndivine are seen fighting for the globe amid lightning and hail; the\r\nwaves of the sea, peopled by monsters of the deep, advancing menacingly\r\ntowards them.\r\n\r\nThe mottoes are often curious and suggestive, for instance:—\r\n\r\n    “_Was achte ich des Monden Schein,\r\n      wenn mir die Sonne gnedig sein._”[178]\r\n\r\nAnother:—\r\n\r\n    “_Niemand weisz mein Sinn\r\n      Ob ich ein Fuchs od Hase bin._”[179]\r\n\r\nThe humorous devices painted were sometimes groups of owls, hares, mice\r\nor foxes. Trappers were usually armoried.\r\n\r\nThe contract price for a complete harness for the tiltyard in the\r\nsecond half of the sixteenth century was usually from 100 to 200\r\n_thalers_ (£20 to £40), rather a wide margin; though anything extra\r\nspecial in the way of enrichment would often cost much more. August\r\n_Kurfürst_ of Saxony ordered from Peffenhaüser of Augsburg in 1582 a\r\n“_Stechkürass fur die Pallier[180] mit allen Doppelstücken, und alle\r\nStücke zum Freirennen und Fussturnier 200 Thalers_,” i.e. a harness for\r\njousting at the tilt with the reinforcing pieces thereto appertaining,\r\ntogether with the additional pieces for _Freirennen_ and _Fussturnier_.\r\nA more ordinary suit “_ein anderer, schlichter, gemeiner Kürass_” is\r\noffered at 100 _thalers_. Four _thalers_ “_Tringeld_” for each suit\r\nwas usually added. A _Feldkürass_ (a hoasting harness) was cheaper,\r\nsay 60 to 80 _thalers_ according to quality. Prices had advanced\r\nsince the beginning of the century. In 1511, September 16, “Conrad\r\nSeusenhofer receives for two suits of armour for his Imperial Majesty\r\nand one for the English Embassy 211 _florins_.”[181]\r\n\r\n1512. Sept 13. “Payments made by Thomas Wuley on the King’s behalf to a\r\ncertain merchant of Florence for 2000 complete harnesses called Almayne\r\nrivets according to pattern in the hands of John Douncy, accounting\r\nalway a salet, a gorget, a breastplate, a back-plate and a pair of\r\nsplints for every complete harness at 16s a set.”[182] Such last-named\r\nsuits were for the soldiery and without armour for the arms and legs.\r\n\r\nHans Schwenkh’s _Wappenmeisterbuch_, the tourney-book of Duke William\r\nIV of Bavaria, in the Royal Library at Munich, commences in 1510. It\r\nwas compiled by Frederich von Schlichtegroll in 1807, it exhibits\r\neight separate forms of the tourney, and covers the jousting of the\r\nduke in the first quarter of the sixteenth century together with later\r\nexamples. The illustrations are faithfully reproduced on stone by the\r\nbrothers Theobald and Clemens Senefeder, with an explanatory text by\r\nSchlichtegroll.\r\n\r\nThe tourney-book of Duke Henry of Braunschweig-Lüneburg is at Berlin;\r\nthat of the Pole Zuganoviez Stanislaus of the year 1574 in the Dresden\r\nHistorical Museum.\r\n\r\nSeveral forms of jousting, combats on foot and the tourney prevailing\r\nin the fifteenth century have been lightly touched upon, and a more\r\ndetailed statement of the leading courses now follows, together with an\r\naccount of their more important variants.\r\n\r\nThe main courses of the jousts are:—\r\n\r\n    1. Courses run in the lists with lances rebated or\r\n        tipped with coronals, without a tilt or barrier\r\n        between the jousters; the chief object in view\r\n        being the splintering of lances and unhorsing.\r\n\r\n    2. Courses of courtesy run in the lists with sharp\r\n        lances, also without a tilt; the main desideratum\r\n        being unhorsing.\r\n\r\n    3. Courses run with lances tipped with coronals, in\r\n        which the jousters charged along a tilt which was\r\n        between them. In this course the chief object in\r\n        view was the splintering of lances.\r\n\r\nThere are many variants in the first two groups.\r\n\r\nThese three classes were practised more or less in all the countries of\r\nchivalry in the sixteenth century, though outside Germany it was the\r\njoust at the tilt which was commonly run. In the Fatherland and Austria\r\nthese courses were known respectively as the _Gestech_ or _Stechen_,\r\n_Scharfrennen_ or _Rennen_, and the _Welsch Gestech_ or Italian joust.\r\n\r\nThe type of joust run in the lists without a barrier or tilt, the\r\nlances tipped with coronals, is a very old one, though it had been\r\nsubjected to a gradual modification and the application of safeguards\r\nas the centuries had advanced. The horses were blindfolded, so that\r\nthey should not flinch or jib at the moment of impact, and so deflect\r\nthe aim of the rider; and the animals were also sometimes rendered deaf\r\nby the stopping of their ears with wool, and they were often muzzled.\r\nExcept in the case of one German variant of this class, the legs of the\r\nriders were without armour, these limbs being sufficiently protected by\r\nthe saddle-steels. A chamfron, sometimes spiked, covered the face of\r\nthe horse, and a crinet its neck. A cushion or mattress (_Stechkissen_\r\nor _Bourrelet_), filled with straw, hung from the saddle-bow, covering\r\nthe chest of the animal, to act as a buffer when there were collisions,\r\nwhich frequently happened in the absence of a tilt; and, indeed, in\r\nsuch cases one or both chargers, with their riders, often fell. An\r\nillustration of this cushion is given in the _Tourney Book of René\r\nd’Anjou_, and another by Boeheim in his _Waffenkunde_, drawn after an\r\nactual example, which is believed to have belonged to Maximilian I, and\r\nnow forms part of the superb collection of arms and armour at Vienna.\r\nThe horse was usually barded in leather, which did not extend to the\r\nfront, and a trapper, painted with various devices, covered its body.\r\nThe saddle employed in Class 1, which weighs about 10·2 _kilos._, has a\r\nhigh squared plate in front reaching to the jouster’s breast, and there\r\nare short steels, though no cantle; so that unhorsing was of frequent\r\noccurrence. The head-piece of this class was the great jousting-helm.\r\nThis course involved much more skill and initiative in the jouster and\r\na more careful training of the horse than did the joust at the tilt.\r\nThis class of joust was much practised in Germany under the general\r\nname “_Gestech_” or its abbreviation “_Stechen_,” and was in three\r\nforms:\r\n\r\n    (a) _Das Gestech im hohen Zeug_ or _Hohenzeuggestech_,\r\n         known in France as _Joûte à la haute barde_.\r\n\r\n    (b) _Das gemeine deutsche Gestech._ _La Joûte Allemand._\r\n\r\n    (c) _Das Gestech im Beinharnisch._ _Joûte au harnois de\r\n         jambe._\r\n\r\nThe joust in Germany was a ruder sport than that practised in other\r\ncountries, and unhorsing very frequently took place.\r\n\r\n_Hohenzeuggestech_ is an older form of the group, its main object\r\nbeing the splintering of lances. In this course the jouster sat high\r\nup on his horse in a saddle formed like a well, and his body being\r\nwell supported on all sides unhorsing was impossible as long as the\r\nanimal kept its legs and the girths held. This form of saddle had\r\nbeen employed in the _Kolbenturnier_ or baston course (i.e. a duel on\r\nhorseback with heavy bastons or maces), which prevailed during the\r\nfifteenth century and which has been described. The protection on the\r\nsaddle front in _Hohenzeuggestech_ rises over the rider’s breast, a\r\nbroad band of iron encircles his body, and the steels are long and\r\nbroad. The saddle weighs about 12 _kilos._ The horse ran blindfolded\r\nin a leather bard and trapper of cloth; the rider’s legs and feet were\r\nencased in hose and well-padded shoes, no armour being necessary, as\r\nthe saddle-steels afforded ample protection. The mobility of both man\r\nand horse must have been much restricted by the heavy armament and\r\nby the blindfolding and the thick cushion over the breast. The heavy\r\nFlemish horses “did not vanish from their posts like lightning and\r\nclose in the centre of the lists like a thunderbolt,” but charged at an\r\namble.\r\n\r\nPlate III pictures Maximilian armed for _Hohenzeuggestech_, as shown in\r\n_Freydal_, Plate 98.\r\n\r\n_Das gemeinedeutsche Gestech._ In this course the object was unhorsing,\r\nor at least the splintering of a lance on an opponent’s shield. In\r\n_Freydal_ there are eighteen illustrations of this form of joust. The\r\narmour for the course underwent a complete change about the beginning\r\nof the fifteenth century, a special form of harness having been\r\ndesigned for it. The legs and feet were without armour.\r\n\r\nPlate IV illustrates two harnesses for the German joust (_Gestech_ or\r\n_Stechen_). Both date in the last quarter of the fifteenth century,\r\nthat with tassets being the later of the two. They are now at Paris.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE IV_\r\n\r\nTWO HARNESSES FOR THE GERMAN JOUST OR _GESTECH_. AT PARIS.]\r\n\r\nPlate IX (1) pictures a suit in the Wallace Collection, London,[183]\r\nfor the _Gestech_ (_Stechen_). It is very heavy, weighing about a\r\nhundredweight, leaving the wearer with little other mobility than was\r\nneeded to couch and aim his lance; it had evidently seen some service,\r\nand bears the dents of many jousts. It is the only complete armour of\r\nthis kind that we know of in this country. The great jousting-helm\r\nweighs about twenty pounds: it is bucket-formed, and extends down in\r\none piece over the top of the cuirass, to which it is fastened by\r\nthree strong screws, two in front and one behind—the latter, placed\r\nvertically, is adjustable for getting the correct line of vision. The\r\ncrown-piece curves gently over the wearer’s head, and has a comb along\r\nthe top pierced with twin holes for attaching the crest and torse or\r\nwreath which encircles its base. The eyelets for fastening the lining\r\nare bordered with laton, and the rivets are capped with the same\r\nmetal, a golden looking blend, something between bronze and brass.\r\nThe _oculārium_ affords but a very limited range of vision, and the\r\nfront of the head-piece juts out in a sort of beak. The helm is very\r\nroomy, so that the wearer could move his head about freely under the\r\ncap of felt and leather lining, and small cushions stuffed with hair\r\nor feathers were over the temples. The breastplate is globose, and, as\r\nusual with armour for _Stechen_ and also for _Rennen_, is flattened\r\non the right side for better couching and aiming the lance. It is\r\nreinforced with a heavy plate over the abdomen, to which the taces, of\r\nfive heavy lames, are riveted. The back-plate is in three overlapping\r\nplates. A garde-rein (_Schwänzel_) of five lames protects the loins,\r\nand the tuilles, garnished with a figure like a horn, are tile-formed.\r\nThe motons over the armpits, fastened in their places by straps of\r\nleather, are plain and very large—9½ inches across; that on the right\r\nside is pierced with a _bouche_, to leave space for the lance-shaft.\r\nOn the right side is a lance-rest (_Rüsthaken_), and, as is usual\r\nin armour for both _Gestech_ and _Scharfrennen_, there is a heavy\r\nqueue, termed in German a _Rasthaken_, which acted as a counterpoise\r\nfor holding the heavy lance used in the course in position, and for\r\navoiding much strain on the lance-arm. The lance-shaft lies in the\r\nbed of the lance-rest, and is held under the queue behind it on the\r\nflattened part of the cuirass, the direction towards impact being\r\nguided by the hand. The cuirass is held together by hinged straps or\r\nstrips of iron, which are pierced for fitting over staples and are\r\nsecured by nuts. The pauldrons are each in five plates, with wings\r\nbehind, and the coudes are pointed. On the top of each shoulder is\r\na thin iron peg, which stands up diagonally, fixed to the armour by\r\nlaton-headed rivets. These projections are roughly about two inches\r\nlong, and are squared and topped like a nail. They were perhaps\r\nintended as winding pegs for the tassels or jagged ends of the mantling\r\nwhich usually streamed out from the jousting-helm. Such pegs are\r\npresent on two similar harnesses at Paris. The right hand is without a\r\ngauntlet; the arm bears the poldermiton or _épaule de mouton_, stamped\r\nwith the Augsburg guild badge; and on the bridle forearm and hand is\r\nthe stiff and heavy mainfere, the jousting gauntlet. The jousting\r\nshield is of hard wood, covered with leather and gesso, about 15½\r\ninches broad by 14 inches high: it is formed rectangularly at the top,\r\nsomewhat rounded at the bottom, and is slightly concave and emblazoned.\r\nPieces of horn are let into it to lend it elasticity and stability. It\r\nis fastened by cords to a pierced wooden block fixed on the breastplate\r\nand is held in position by a strap which buckles on to the helm. The\r\nharness itself bears the Augsburg guild stamp, a fir-cone and the\r\nletter “S” with an indistinct bar or bâton running through it. It is\r\ndated in the last quarter of the fifteenth century. No leg-armour was\r\nworn, so as to give the rider a better grip of his horse; hose covered\r\nthe shanks, and well-wadded shoes, of cloth or leather, the feet.\r\n\r\nThere is almost an exact counterpart of this suit in a harness in the\r\nfine collection at Nuremberg, also forged at Augsburg, with the year\r\nof make, 1498, inscribed on the armour, the only difference between\r\nthe two suits being that there are here tassets of laminated plates\r\ninstead of the solid tuilles present on the Wallace suit, the tuilles\r\nbeing an indication of a somewhat earlier date. There are three similar\r\nharnesses at Vienna. The weight of the armour with shield is usually\r\nabout 45·6 _kilos._ When arming, the different pieces are screwed on\r\none after the other, the jousting-shield being adjusted last.\r\n\r\nThe lance is of fir or pine and is stouter than that used in _Rennen_;\r\nits greatest diameter is 9 _centimetres_, length 373 _cm._, and weight,\r\nwith vamplate and coronal, about 14·3 _kilos._ An example may be seen\r\nin the writer’s collection of arms and armour at Tynemouth.\r\n\r\nPlate 9 in the tourney-book appertaining to the _Kurfürst_ Johann (_des\r\nBeständigen_) pictures a _Gestech_ at Leipsig in 1489, between Duke\r\nHans of Saxony and Von Wunsdorf, in which the latter was unhorsed. The\r\nduke wears the jousting-helm, a spiked moton is over the armpit, and\r\nhis lance is heavy and furnished with the circular form of vamplate,\r\nviz. that used in _Gestech_. The horse wears a collar of bells\r\n(_grelots_ or _Schellenkette_), and a cushion over the breast; the body\r\nis covered with a trapper, painted with the royal arms. The equipment\r\ncorresponds with the date of the armour shown on Plate IX (1).\r\n\r\nThe frontispiece of this work is taken from the tourney-book of the\r\n_Kurfürst_ Johann Friedrich (_des Groszüthigen_), Plate 81. It depicts\r\nthe _Kurfürst_ running in _Gestech_ at the moment when his adversary\r\nis being hurled from his saddle. The victor’s body-armour, vamplate,\r\nthe chamfron of his horse and the coronal of his mighty lance are\r\nall painted the colour of steel. His crest, enriched by a crown at\r\nits base, is the Saxon emblem or badge (_Kleinod_), it is painted in\r\na tawny colour with black stripes. The hose are striped in colours,\r\ngreen, pink, white and black; the shoes are of black felt. The trapper,\r\nreaching down to the horse’s houges, is banded in white, blue and two\r\nshades of red, and is sprinkled with the ciphers “XS” in gold and\r\nsilver. It bears, twice repeated, the arms of Meiszen, Thuringen,\r\nPfalz-Sachsen and Landsberg with the crested helm and shield of Saxony.\r\nThe horses wear necklets of bells (_Shellenkette_). The trapper of the\r\nopposing champion is banded in shades of yellow and red sprinkled with\r\nfoliations; his crest a pair of silver horns with a coronet encircling\r\nthe base and silver laterals of linden twigs and leaves. The details of\r\nthe armour are very clear and the picture a good representative of its\r\nclass.\r\n\r\n_Das Gestech im Beinharnisch_ is a course run with leg-armour, as its\r\nname implies. The object is unhorsing and the splintering of lances.\r\nThe _Kuriss_ saddle was employed. The presence of leg-armour rendered\r\nunhorsing much easier of accomplishment than without it, for the belly\r\nof the horse could not be so well gripped.\r\n\r\nThe joust of courtesy with pointed lances, as differentiated from\r\nFroissart’s _justes mortelles_, was, as we have seen, much practised\r\nthroughout the fifteenth century; and it continued being run in\r\nGermany until soon after the middle of the sixteenth, when it became\r\npractically displaced by the joust at the tilt. This course was known\r\nin Germany as _Scharfrennen_ or _Schweifrennen_, in France as _La\r\nCourse à la queue_; it is illustrated six times in _Freydal_ and many\r\ntimes in the Saxon tourney-books.\r\n\r\nThe main desideratum of the course was unhorsing, and the form of the\r\nsaddle had been designed with that object specially in view, though\r\nthe splintering of lances also counted in the score, in fact, the\r\njouster who sat his horse the longest against the greatest number of\r\nsplintered lances, or without being unhelmed, was declared the victor.\r\nThe objective of the lance in this course was either the beaver of an\r\nopponent or his jousting-shield on the left side. The first-named mark\r\nwas more difficult to hit than the other and the lance more liable to\r\nglance off, but when fairly struck it proved irresistible. As a rule\r\nthe effect of impact was that the rider reeled in his saddle as he\r\ntried to maintain his seat, though usually one or other of the jousters\r\nwas unhorsed, and, indeed, sometimes both fell, unless supported\r\nat the critical moment by the varlets. The lance was held with the\r\npoint inclining slightly upwards, and, as in the other courses, the\r\njouster promptly withdrew his hand and arm from the shaft immediately\r\nafter impact, holding his arm upright, and the broken lance fell to\r\nthe ground. It was the omission to do this which caused the accident\r\nresulting in the death of Henri II of France. The lance was a long,\r\nthin, rounded straight pole of soft wood, lighter than was used in\r\n_Stechen_, and was about 373 _centimetres_ long with a largest diameter\r\nof about 7 _cm._, as against 9 _cm._ in the one for _Gestech_. The\r\nvamplate is in the form of a truncated cone. _Rennen_ (_Scharfrennen_)\r\nwas an even hardier course than _Stechen_, and demanded a still more\r\ncareful training in man and horse and a surer seat.\r\n\r\nThe salient features of this form of joust are as follows:—The saddle\r\nemployed in all its varieties was smaller and lighter than that used in\r\nthe other courses, the weight being only a little over four _kilos._;\r\nit had a low pommel and no cantle, and was shaped, in fact, much like\r\nthe British saddle of to-day. Jousting-cuisses (_Dülgen_ or _Dilgen_,\r\nweighing 12 _kilos._) hung from it and protected the lower limbs of\r\nthe jouster, which were unarmoured. The armour was lighter than that\r\nused in _Stechen_, though somewhat similar in form, and the back-plate\r\nwas shorter. The helmet was a jousting-salade (_Rennhut_) forged in\r\none piece, without any movable visor, but with a separate beaver\r\nreaching well over the top of the cuirass, to which it was screwed,\r\nback and front. It was well lined, and a cap of leather or silk was\r\nworn. The parts of the salade extending over the temples of the wearer\r\nwere strengthened by extra plates (_Stirnplätter_); and there was a\r\nthick reinforcing plate (_Magenblech_) over the abdomen, and to it\r\nthe heavy taces and tassets were riveted. The horse was barded as in\r\n_Stechen_, a cushion or mattress protected the breast, and the animal\r\nwas covered with the trapper. As in _Stechen_ the cuirass was flattened\r\non the right side, and to it the lance-rest (_Rüsthaken_) and queue\r\n(_Rasthaken_) were screwed. The queue was smaller than that on the\r\nharness for _Stechen_, the lance used in _Rennen_ being lighter. There\r\nwere no motons over the armpits, these weak places being well protected\r\nby the vamplate, which was larger and differently formed from that\r\nemployed in _Stechen_. The shape was that of a truncated cone. The\r\nlarge concave shield of wood, covered with leather and plated with\r\niron, was 6 to 8 _cm._ in breadth, it was screwed on to the beaver, and\r\nan armlet encircled the right lower arm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE V_\r\n\r\nHARNESS FOR _SCHARFRENNEN_. AT DRESDEN.]\r\n\r\nSuits for both _Rennen_ and _Stechen_ were made so that they could\r\nbe worn by a man of anything like a medium size; they were costly,\r\nand were frequently lent out by princes and the great nobles to their\r\npoorer brethren who lacked this equipment. A beautiful harness for\r\n_Scharfrennen_, made for the _Kurfürst_ August of Saxony (1553-1586),\r\nby Sigmund Rockenburger, of Wittenberg, in 1554, is in the Dresden\r\nMuseum. The form of the harness is graceful, and it is richly\r\nand tastefully etched with human figures, a double-headed eagle\r\nand foliations; in the centre of the breastplate is a spear-like\r\nprojection—a fashion which did not last very long. The back-plate is\r\nunusually short and so is the garde-rein (_Schwänzel_). This harness is\r\nillustrated on Plate V. The weight is about forty _kilos._ The spurs\r\nhave long shanks and are of both the rowel and prick kinds.\r\n\r\nThe store of armours for the tournament kept by the Saxon _Kurfürsts_\r\nat Dresden greatly accounts for the number of historic suits preserved\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nIn the _Turnierwaffensaal_ at the Johanneum, Dresden, is a fine\r\nrealistic representation of a _Scharfrennen_, the jousters mounted and\r\nin complete armour down to the smallest detail. They are facing each\r\nother, with lances in rest. The armour is etched and gilt, and every\r\ndetail is original except the under-garment, the hose and well-wadded\r\nshoes. The period is about the middle of the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nPlate VI illustrates Maximilian II, mounted and armed for\r\n_Scharfrennen_ in 1564. The armour is in the Collection at the Musée\r\nd’Artillerie, Paris.\r\n\r\nPlate VIII (1) pictures a _Rennen_, held at Minden, between the\r\n_Kurfürst_ August of Saxony and Johann von Ratzenberg. This particular\r\njoust was termed a “_Gedritts_,” signifying that the victor in the\r\nfirst encounter had still to dispose of a second antagonist in\r\norder to gain the prize; three were thus engaged, and hence the\r\nname. The _Kurfürst’s_ second adversary was Hans von Sehönfeld. The\r\njousting-salade, large vamplate, jousting-cuisses and other details are\r\nclearly shown. Numerous illustrations of _Scharfrennen_ are present\r\nin _Freydal_ and in the Saxon tourney-books. There are many variants\r\nfrom the main course, the most important being _Geschiftrennen, la\r\ncourse à la targe futée_. It is of two kinds, _Geschifttartscherennen_\r\n(_tartsche_, a shield) and _Geschiftscheibenrennen_ (_scheibe_, a plate\r\nor disk); the wearing of a shield or a large plate or disk of iron\r\nover the breastplate being the main distinction between them. In both\r\ncases, when the centres of the shields were fairly struck by a lance\r\na mechanism was set in motion by the freeing of a spring, which in\r\n_Geschifttartscherennen_ dissolved the shield itself into fragments,\r\nthe pieces flying over the jouster’s head in wedged-formed particles.\r\nIn _Geschiftscheibenrennen_, on the right impact having been attained\r\nthe iron plate remained in its place and only the wedge in the centre\r\nflew out. The mechanism of the first-named was much more complicated\r\nthan that of the latter.\r\n\r\nUnhorsing was another of the objects in view in both cases. Both\r\ncourses would seem to have had their origin in the game of Running at\r\nthe Ring. There is an illustration of the mechanism at the back of\r\nthe shield given in a picture-codex in the Armeria at Madrid, dating\r\nabout 1544.[184] The general equipment in both cases was the same as in\r\n_Scharfrennen_.\r\n\r\nIllustrations of _Geschifttartscherennen_ are given in _Freydal_, both\r\nwith leg-armour and without. In plates of that work. Nos. 29 and 45,\r\nthe shields are seen flying in pieces in the air and both riders are\r\nunhorsed; while in Plate 5, here reproduced in our Plate VII, both\r\nriders keep their seats, but the shields are seen dissolving into\r\nfragments over the heads of the jousters. There is but one illustration\r\nof _Geschiftscheibenrennen_ in _Freydal_, viz. in Plate 41. There are\r\nalso illustrations in the _Triumph of Maximilian_.\r\n\r\nIn _Bundrennen_, often called _Pundtrennen, Course appelée Bund_, the\r\njouster here also endeavoured to strike the centre of his opponent’s\r\nshield, but the main object was unhorsing. This was the most dangerous\r\nof all the courses, in the fact that a disrupting shield was employed,\r\nlike that used in _Geschifttartscherennen_, but without any protecting\r\nbeaver beneath it, so that the sharp lance was apt to glance off\r\ninto the jouster’s face or a fragment of the disrupted shield fly\r\ninto it, sometimes injuring the nose or eyes. This course, says the\r\n_Weisskünig_, “was certainly amusing to look upon, though with often\r\nsorrowful results to one or other of the combatants.”[185] In one of\r\nthe plates of _Freydal_ (No. 25), illustrating this course, the emperor\r\nand his opponent are both seen as being unhorsed; while in other\r\nplates (Nos. 21, 62, 73, 93 and 204) the shields spring disrupted into\r\nthe air, but the jousters retain their seats.\r\n\r\n_Anzogenrennen, Course au pavois_,[186] is a kind in which a very\r\nlong shield was employed, which was firmly fixed to the beaver by a\r\nlarge screw with a considerably projecting head. The immediate object\r\nwas unhorsing, or at least the splintering of lances. A picture in\r\nthe tourney-book of Duke William IV of Bavaria furnishes a good\r\nillustration of the course as run in the year 1512, and there are\r\nlater examples in the tourney-books of the Saxon _Kurfürsts_. The arms\r\nand lower limbs are unarmoured, the harness the same as that employed\r\nin _Scharfrennen_. The shield is very long, extending from the slit\r\nfor vision in the salade down to below the abdomen. The part over the\r\nbreastplate conforms to the contour of that piece, while below it the\r\nshield becomes concave in form. There is usually a spike in the centre.\r\nThere are twenty-five illustrations in _Freydal_ (Plates Nos. 9, 17,\r\n50, 58, 89, 97, 141, 180 and 240), all of which exhibit the opponents\r\nof Maximilian as being unhorsed; while in Plate 169 both riders retain\r\ntheir seats. In other plates both jousters are unseated.\r\n\r\n_Krönlrennen_ was a freak, probably of Maximilian’s, first run in 1492.\r\nIt is called “_Halbierung_” in the tourney-book of _Kurfürst_ August\r\nof Saxony, and is a blending together of the courses _Scharfrennen_\r\nand _Gestech_, in that one jouster wore the armour usually employed in\r\n_Scharfrennen_, but used the lance headed with a coronal appertaining\r\nto the _Gestech_; the other, the harness for the _Gestech_ with\r\nthe sharp lance. The objects of the course were unhorsing and the\r\nsplintering of lances. Plate 6 in _Freydal_ illustrates _Krönlrennen_,\r\nand there is an excellent example given in the tourney-book of August\r\nof Saxony, Plate I.\r\n\r\nIn _Pfannenrennen_ the combatants ran without body-armour, except for a\r\nsquare metal shield on the breast, and the horses wore hoods.\r\n\r\n_Feldrennen_ closes the list under _Scharfrennen_. “Hoasting” armour\r\nwas employed; the saddle was that used in jousting at the tilt. The\r\nhorses were not always blindfolded, and the immediate object in view\r\nwas the splintering of lances.\r\n\r\nIn the _tourney proper_, or _mêlée_, field-harness with _Kuriss_\r\nsaddles were usually employed. Lances are splintered, and the combat\r\ncontinued with swords.\r\n\r\nOne of the fifteenth century forms was the _Feldturnier_, or field\r\ncourse, a combat of groups on horseback. Ordinary field-harness, with\r\nor without reinforcing pieces, was usually worn. This form of contest\r\nis illustrated in the tourney-book of Duke William IV of Bavaria,\r\nshowing that each cavalier was always provided with two swords. In what\r\nrespects it differed from the ordinary _mêlée_ is not apparent. Both\r\nswords and lances were employed.\r\n\r\nThe joust at the tilt has been already referred to more than once,\r\nand some account given of its leading features. There is reason to\r\nbelieve that it was practised as early as the first quarter of the\r\nfifteenth century, and we have mentioned cases of a _toile_ having been\r\nemployed at Arras in Burgundy in the year 1430, with some rather later\r\ninstances. Viscount Dillon, in his paper “Tilting in Tudor Times,”\r\npublished in the _Archæological Journal_ of the year 1898,[187] gives\r\nan extract from the _Chronicles of St. Remy_ to the effect that the\r\n_toile_ or tilt probably originated in Portugal. As already stated, the\r\nsalient feature of this form is that it was run with a barrier between\r\nthe jousters, along which they rode in opposite directions, their left\r\nsides towards it, until impact was effected. The first barrier was\r\na _toile_, a rope hung with cloth extending along the length of the\r\nlists; but as this did not prevent the horses from bumping against one\r\nanother a tilt of planks, usually about six feet high, was devised,\r\nwhich effectually kept them apart, and collisions were avoided, thus\r\nrendering the sport much less dangerous. The use of the tilt made\r\nimpact more uncertain than when running “at the large,” and there was\r\nusually a considerable proportion of non-attaints. The main object of\r\nthis course was the splintering of lances, though unhorsing was also in\r\ncontemplation and not unfrequently took place. Unseating was, however,\r\nrendered difficult by the form of the saddle employed, the so-called\r\n_Kuriss_ saddle, which had a cantle behind and a high pommel in front,\r\nthus making it much easier for a rider to keep his seat. The usual\r\nweight of this form of saddle was a little over 9 _kilos._ Jousting at\r\nthe tilt soon greatly supplanted the earlier form in France, Italy and\r\nEngland; but it took no root in Germany before the sixteenth century,\r\nat the commencement of which it is stated to have been introduced\r\ninto that country and Austria from Italy. The name “_Welsch Gestech_”\r\n(Italian Joust), given it in the Fatherland, tends greatly to confirm\r\nthis; and, indeed, it was just at this time that Maximilian was\r\nintroducing a new style of armour from Italy into his dominions. Though\r\nfrequently practised in Germany during the first half of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, the joust at the tilt by no means displaced running “at the\r\nlarge” there. Several plates in _Freydal_ furnish illustrations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE VI_\r\n\r\nMAXIMILIAN II ARMED FOR _SCHARFRENNEN_. AT PARIS.]\r\n\r\nPlate VIII (2) depicts a joust at the tilt, run at Augsburg in 1510,\r\nbetween Duke William IV of Bavaria and the Pfalzgraf Friedrich of\r\nthe Rhine. The illustration is reproduced from a picture in Hans\r\nSchwenkh’s _Wappenmeisterbuch_, the tourney-book of the duke, who is\r\nseen jousting; it is a work which has already been referred to in\r\nthese pages. The tilt itself, of three broad planks, is of massive\r\nconstruction. The harness worn in the earlier form was the _Stechzeug_,\r\nthe kind that was used in the German _Gestech_, with no leg-armour,\r\na style which has been already described and illustrated on Plate IX\r\n(1). The cuirass employed is flattened on the lance side, and there is\r\na _Rasthaken_ or queue as well as a lance-rest. Bases are worn by the\r\nriders, and a crest of plumes. The trapper of the duke’s horse, dark in\r\ncolour, is shot with painted rays over the body, and a picture of the\r\nSun in Splendour encircles the horse’s tail, which is further decorated\r\nwith plumes. A collar of _grelots_ is around the neck of the animal;\r\nthe head is adorned with plumes, and the chamfron embellished with a\r\npicture of the sun. The lances with coronals are well shown; the former\r\nare long poles narrowing gently towards the heads, and the latter are\r\nin three short prongs.\r\n\r\nPlate XI (1) pictures two fine suits at Paris for jousting at the\r\ntilt, one of them with the manifer or mainfere, the passe-guard and\r\npoldermiton in their places.\r\n\r\nPlate X (1) illustrates a German harness, at Dresden, for this form\r\nof joust. It dates about 1580. There are three armours for jousting\r\nat the tilt in the Wallace Collection of Arms and Armour at London,\r\nCatalogue Numbers 484, 495 and 505. The first of these is a harness\r\nfor _Realgestech_, as shown by the cross-ribbed shield, a device for\r\naffording a grip for the coronal of the lance on impact in order to\r\nprevent it from glancing off—another departure in the direction of\r\ngreater safety for the jouster. This course was a late variety of the\r\njoust at the tilt.\r\n\r\nNo. 505, illustrated on Plate IX (2) is perhaps somewhat earlier\r\nin date than the other two suits, for in the right side of the\r\n“volante-piece” is a little square door or window, for enabling the\r\nwearer to converse freely when open. This aperture is about three\r\ninches square in size and freely perforated so as to admit air to the\r\nwearer when closed. It is shut, of course, when the jouster is ready\r\nfor his career. In other respects the three suits are very much alike;\r\nand the “peaescod-bellied” breastplates of all of them tend to fix\r\ntheir date within narrow limits. The shields of Nos. 495 and 505 are\r\npractically the same in form and size. They fit round the front of the\r\nleft side of the neck and cover the left shoulder and breast, running\r\nnearly straight down to the middle of the breastplate. The grand-guards\r\nare screwed to the upper parts of the breastplate and the shields are\r\nattached to them in like manner. The other reinforcing pieces are\r\neither present with the suits, or the armour is holed for them.\r\n\r\nThe sad accident which resulted in the death of Henri II, of France, at\r\na _fête d’armes_ held at Paris in 1559, was in a joust at the tilt with\r\nthe Comte de Montgomeri. It was caused by the Comte failing to drop his\r\nsplintered lance in good time.\r\n\r\nThe drawings of Hans Burgmaier in the _Triumph of Maximilian_ afford\r\nillustrations of some of the varieties of the German jousting of the\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nPlate 45 illustrates the _Welsch Gestech_ (Italian Joust) or Joust\r\nat the Tilt. The head-piece is the jousting-helm and the reinforcing\r\npieces are in their places. The lance, tipped with a coronal,\r\nis lighter than that employed in the German _Gestech_ and in\r\n_Scharfrennen_ and the vamplate is circular in form. Feather plumes are\r\nworn.\r\n\r\nPlate 46 pictures the Gestech or German joust (_Das gemeine deutsche\r\nGestech_). The head-piece is the same as that on Plate 45. A cushion\r\nis worn over the horse’s chest, and a _Rasthaken_, or queue, and a\r\n_Rüsthaken_, or lance-rest, are on the flattened right side of the\r\ncuirass. The lance is heavy and tipped with a coronal. The crests shown\r\nare very fanciful.\r\n\r\nPlate 47 illustrates _Hohenzeuggestech_. The jousters are seated\r\non the high saddles (_im hohen Zeug_) peculiar to the course. The\r\njousting-helm is worn. Lances are tipped with coronals, as is the case\r\nwith all varieties of the _Gestech_.\r\n\r\nPlate 48. _Das Gestech im Beinharnisch._ This is a variety of _Gestech_\r\nin which leg-armour is worn, as the name implies.\r\n\r\nPlates 50 and 55 picture _Bundrennen_, the peculiarity of the course\r\nbeing that no beaver is worn beneath the disrupting shield. This makes\r\nit the most dangerous of all the courses, and injuries to the face were\r\nfrequent. The vamplate is large and formed like a truncated cone.\r\n\r\nPlate 51 depicts _Geschifttartscherennen_, in which course the shield,\r\nwhen struck by the lance on a certain spot, dissolves in fragments over\r\nthe jouster’s head.\r\n\r\nPlate 52. It pictures _Geschiftscheibenrennen_, a course similar in\r\nprinciple to the last-named, the difference being that the shield is\r\na disk which, when properly struck, flies into the air, or the shield\r\nremains in its place but the plug in the centre flies out.\r\n\r\nPlate 53. The cavaliers are here accoutred for the pan joust\r\n(_Pfannenrennen_). There are one or two other varieties of the joust\r\ndepicted.\r\n\r\nSeveral combats on foot of the fifteenth century, perhaps the most\r\ndangerous items of the articles of a _pas d’armes_ of that period,\r\nhave been fully described in Chapters III, IV and V, in the narrations\r\nby contemporary chroniclers of actual encounters. The character of\r\nthese contests underwent a great change in the sixteenth century,\r\nthrough the introduction of barriers over which the combatants fought.\r\nThese bars or barriers reached up to the breasts of the fighters,\r\nand prevented their grappling with each other or getting out of\r\nbounds. They made their appearance probably in the last decade of\r\nthe fifteenth century. As the tilt had been conceived with a view\r\ntowards mitigating the danger of the joust, so barriers were adopted\r\ntowards minimizing the risk of serious injuries in fighting on foot,\r\nand, indeed, the new style was hardly more dangerous than the game\r\nof football as played to-day. This latest phase is well described by\r\nViscount Dillon in “Barriers and Foot Combats,” a paper published in\r\nthe _Archæological Journal_ of 1904.[188] The special features of the\r\narmour for combats of this kind are its massive character, the presence\r\nof an apron (_Kampfschurtz_, a sort of continuation of the taces), and\r\nthe large, thick, globose bascinet. A fine armour for foot-fighting\r\nin the lists may be seen in the Tower of London. It is a grand piece\r\nof work, weighing about 93 lbs., sent by Maximilian of Austria to our\r\nHenry VIII. The Vienna Collection possesses seven complete armours for\r\nfighting on foot, which vary considerably, both in form and weight.\r\nThe weapons employed in these contests in Germany and Austria, as\r\ngiven in _Freydal_, are the sword in different forms, including the\r\n“bastard” (a hand and a half sword), the dussack, the _Kurisschwert_\r\nor armying-sword, and even the two-handed sword (_Zweihänder_ or\r\n_Schlachtschwert_), the dagger, battle-axe (including the _bec\r\nde faucon_), mace, halbard, _ranseur_, guisarme, _Aalspiesse_ (a\r\nshort-shafted spear with rondel-guard), _Langspiess_ (a short lance),\r\n_Würfspiess_ (a javelin), _Stange_ (a quarter-staff), and _Drischel_\r\n(the military flail).\r\n\r\nThe _Fussturnier_, which originated in the sixteenth century, was a\r\nfighting in groups on foot over a barrier, and in it and some other\r\ncourses the challengers were termed “Maintenators” and their opponents\r\n“Aventuriers.” Each combatant had to deliver three thrusts with the\r\nlance and four strokes with the sword. Dr. Cornelius Curlitt gives the\r\nfollowing extract from _Acten des Dresdener Oberhofmarshallamtes_ of\r\nthe year 1614:—“The one who shivers the greatest number of lances in\r\nthe most adroit manner shall have the lance prize; and he who in five\r\nstrokes strikes the bravest and strongest with the sword shall have the\r\nsecond prize.” The locking gauntlet was forbidden, and the lower limbs\r\nwere without armour. A harness for this kind of fighting, by Anton\r\nPeffenhaüser, worn by the _Kurfürst_ Johan George of Saxony in 1613, is\r\nnow in the Dresden Museum. The head-piece is a burgonet.\r\n\r\nAn important later form of joust is the _Freiturnier_, or Free Course,\r\nwhich grew out of the old German _Gestech_, and, like it, was run “at\r\nthe large,” that is without a tilt. There is a harness for this course\r\nat Dresden, reproduced on Plate X (2). The passguard is much larger\r\nthan that worn in jousting at the tilt, reaching nearly to the left\r\nshoulder. Leg-armour was worn. The harness illustrated in Boeheim’s\r\n_Waffenkunde_ (Fig. 655) as being for the _Welsch Gestech_, or joust at\r\nthe tilt, is really for _Freiturnier_, a form of joust which does not\r\nappear before the second half of the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nAs already stated, the suit in the Wallace Collection, numbered\r\n484 in the catalogue of that institution, is for _Realgestech_ or\r\n_Plankengestech_, a variety of joust at the tilt. It first appeared\r\nabout 1540, and did not differ materially from the main course; nor did\r\nthe armour employed differ except for the cross-ribbing on the shield.\r\nThis course, like the others, fell into disuse in the seventeenth\r\ncentury, though it was the last to survive except the one called\r\n_Scharmützel_, often a sort of general siege or skirmish, with a view\r\nto practice for actual warfare. A _Scharmützel_ was held at Dresden in\r\n1553, when four bands of horsemen attacked a mock fortress, defended\r\nby a garrison armed with _Aalspiesse_ and military forks, and supplied\r\nwith four hundred earthenware pots for missiles, to be thrown empty.\r\nCannon were employed on both sides, presumably fired in blank, though\r\nthis is not stated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE VII_\r\n\r\n_GESCHIFTTARTSCHERENNEN_]\r\n\r\nThe foregoing comprise the most distinctive forms of the tourney.\r\n\r\nThere were permanent lists in Germany, as also at Calais; and in\r\nEngland, at Westminster, Hampton Court, and Greenwich.\r\n\r\nThe quintain and running at the ring have been described in Chapter\r\nI, and there only remains the _Karoussel_, or _Carrousel_, to be\r\nmentioned. The name is derived from _carosello_, a ball of clay, which\r\nwas hollow. The game was a favourite one at the court of Louis XIV,\r\nwhere it gave rise to handsome dresses and costly display. The players,\r\narranged in opposing bands or sides, were mounted and threw these\r\nmissiles at one another, catching them on their shields. There were\r\nseveral varieties of the game.\r\n\r\nHarness for the tiltyard was usually made thicker than that for field\r\npurposes and was thus somewhat heavier. Much taste and labour were\r\nexpended on its ornamentation.\r\n\r\nThough the best armour was imported from Italy and Germany, a large\r\nproportion of that in use in England was made at home, and, indeed,\r\nthere is plenty of evidence that this is so. Henry VIII, like\r\nMaximilian, took a strong personal interest in all that related to\r\narms and armour, and was very desirous that the form and quality of\r\nharness made in England should be improved. With this object in view,\r\nhe arranged with the emperor for German smiths to be sent to Greenwich,\r\nand some really fine armours were made there during his reign and\r\nlater, many of which have been preserved, though the iron billets\r\nused in forging them were imported from Innsbruck, English iron not\r\nhaving been found to be of a sufficient tensile strength for the best\r\npurposes. Whether this inferiority lay in the process of puddling the\r\niron or to the presence of any considerable proportion of deleterious\r\nelements, such as sulphur and phosphorous, is another matter. Henry\r\nVIII established his “Almain Armouries” at Greenwich about the year\r\n1514.[189]\r\n\r\nThe form of “Hoasting” armour underwent several important changes\r\nduring the course of the sixteenth century and to the time when\r\nbody-armour fell into general disuse. The changes had their origin,\r\nmainly, in new departures in the fashion of the civil dress; indeed,\r\nthe shape of the doublet of each period is faithfully reflected in that\r\nof the cuirass of steel. This following of the modes of the day by the\r\nsmith sometimes resulted in the production of harness which, however\r\neffective from a spectacular point of view, proved most unsuitable for\r\nservice in the field. This was greatly owing to the abandonment of the\r\nprinciple of a glancing surface on the armour, thus tending to effect\r\nlodgment for strokes from weapons of attack, instead of deflecting them.\r\n\r\nThe elegant form of “Gothic” armour of the connoisseur had been\r\nmodelled, as we have seen, after the shapely Florentine dress of the\r\nfifteenth century: but a radical and far-reaching change took place\r\nat the commencement of the sixteenth, following on a new departure in\r\ncivil costume. This style, _armatura spigolata_, is usually known as\r\n“Maximilian,” named after the emperor, and would seem to have been\r\nintroduced by him in his extensive dominions from Italy, after his\r\nItalian campaign in 1496. That “Maximilian” armour was of Italian\r\norigin is clear by the very name it bore in Germany at the time, viz.\r\n“_Mailander Harnisch_.” The leading features of this type are:—the\r\nglobose form of the breastplate; the abnormally wide-toed solerets,\r\nfollowing the new fashion in shoes, “bear-paw” or “cow-mouthed” as\r\nthey were commonly called; the heightening of the shoulder or neck\r\nguards (pieces often, though erroneously, termed pass-guards, a mistake\r\npointed out by Viscount Dillon in one of his valuable and suggestive\r\npapers on armour); and the substitution of laminated tassets in place\r\nof the solid, tile-formed tuilles. The head-piece is the armet, the\r\nmost perfect as well as the most familiar form of helmet—of which,\r\nhowever, there are several varieties. This armour was usually made\r\nfluted, though sometimes plain. When fluted, the whole surface down to\r\nthe jambs, which are always smooth, is covered with narrow, regular\r\nradiating flutings, differing in that respect from “Gothic” armour,\r\nwith its broad, sweeping flutings and ridgings.\r\n\r\nTonlet armour (_à tonne_) has a deep skirt of hoops called “jambers,”\r\nstanding out all round like a more modern crinoline, and moving up\r\nand down like the laths of a Venetian blind. It also had its origin\r\nin Italy, and was copied from the civil skirts of the doublet of the\r\nperiod, called “bases”; which when reproduced in steel were clumsy\r\nand unwieldy. We have here an apt illustration of the lengths people\r\nwill sometimes go in slavishly following a particular fashion, however\r\nclumsy or unsuitable it might be. This style of armour was greatly\r\nemployed in fighting on foot, though a variety was adapted for use on\r\nhorseback. A fine and historic armour for fighting on foot, made by\r\nConrad Seusenhofer of Innsbruck, may be seen in the Tower of London.\r\n\r\nBards probably had their origin in the twelfth century, though there\r\nis little mention of them in English records before the close of the\r\nthirteenth, but in the fourteenth they would appear to have become\r\nfairly common. The chamfron, crinet and peytral are observable in\r\nengravings of the fourteenth century, when they were probably of\r\n_cuir-bouille_. In the _Histoire de Charles VII_ it is stated that\r\na combat, _à outrance_, took place in the year 1446, between the\r\nSeigneurs de Ternant and Galiot de Balthasin,[190] in which the latter\r\nwas mounted “_sur un puissant cheval, liquil selon la costume de\r\nLombardie estoit tout convert de fer_.” A complete equipment of steel\r\nplate for the horse was attained in the second half of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, when, according to a picture in the arsenal at Vienna, painted\r\nin 1480, “_Der Ritter sitz auf seinem bis auf die Hufe verdecten\r\nHengst_.” A fine bard which had belonged to Henry VIII, weighing 92½\r\nlbs., may be seen in the Tower of London. Bards for the tourney were\r\nusually of leather.\r\n\r\nThe expression “trapped and barded,” so frequently met with in records,\r\nis often misunderstood. The bard is a defence for the horse, while the\r\ntrapper is its outside textile covering.\r\n\r\nThe importance of lightly-armed troops in warfare became steadily\r\ngreater, and even as early as the beginning of the sixteenth century\r\na large proportion of the armour for the field was made lighter, and\r\ndemi-harnesses were employed for light cavalry.\r\n\r\nThe imitation in steel of the civil costume was carried to absurd\r\nlengths, as is glaringly shown in the so-called “_Pfeifenharnis_”\r\n(pipe-harness), forged after the picturesque dress of the period, with\r\nits pipings, puffs or rolls, points and slashes. Illustrations of it\r\nmay be seen in the _Triumph of Maximilian_. In a suit in the Wallace\r\nCollection (catalogue No. 555) the details of the dress have been\r\nfaithfully and minutely reproduced in metal. The very fabric of the\r\ncivil costume has been imitated and the slashes are gilded. Harness was\r\nfreely and delicately etched, engraved, damascened, and decorated with\r\nrepoussé work; and some of the ornamentation did away altogether with\r\nthe glancing surface of the armour, thus greatly militating against its\r\nefficiency for military purposes.\r\n\r\nA fine armour in the Zeughaus, at Berlin, affords an excellent example\r\nof the best work of about the middle of the sixteenth century. It is\r\nby Peter von Speyer, of Annaberg, made for the _Kurfürst_ Joachim II,\r\nof Brandenburg, whose arms decorate the breastplate. The helm is\r\nof the type of armet without collar. The peak in the cuirass tends\r\nto be placed lower down as the century advances, until at length\r\nthe “peascod” form is reached, as shown on Plate IX (2). Here the\r\nbreastplate is of the true Elizabethan “peascod” form, converging\r\nto a retreating point at the bottom. You have this shape exactly in\r\nportraits of the Earl of Leicester, and, indeed, of the queen herself.\r\nThe tassets swell out over the hips, another feature observable in the\r\nportraits. This form continued, with some modifications, up to nearly\r\nthe end of the century.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE VIII_\r\n\r\nA _SCHARFRENNEN_ AT MINDEN IN 1545]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A JOUST AT THE TILT IN AUGSBERG IN 1540]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[171] See Appendices A, B and C.\r\n\r\n[172] Vienna. 1880-1882.\r\n\r\n[173] Courses run with pointed lances, those with coronals, combats on\r\nfoot and a _mêlée_, as well as the mummeries in which he was engaged.\r\n\r\n[174] In translation:—\r\n\r\nTHE KNIGHT FREYDAL\r\n\r\n    Now who would read of pastimes\r\n    And joyous deeds of pleasure?\r\n    Let him take up the tournament\r\n    In all its fullest measure.\r\n    This did the gallant Freydal\r\n    In knightly deeds of fame,\r\n    Thus rendering illustrious\r\n    The glories of his name.\r\n    His virtues and his goodness\r\n    Are manifest to all;\r\n    His many glorious triumphs\r\n    At tilt, at masks and ball.\r\n    Thus were his young days brightened\r\n    And the sunniest memories shed,\r\n    The cares of old age lightened\r\n    By brave records of the dead.\r\n    (His like will ne’er be seen again.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[175] _Scharfrennen_ and the _Gestech_.\r\n\r\n[176] The hall where the ancient firearms are on view.\r\n\r\n[177] _The Armouries of the Tower of London_, I, 26.\r\n\r\n[178] “What care I for the moon if the sun be gracious.”\r\n\r\n[179] “No one knows my heart, whether I am a fox or a hare.”\r\n\r\n[180] Joust at the tilt.\r\n\r\n[181] _The Armouries of the Tower of London_, I, 37.\r\n\r\n[182] Ibid., I, 49.\r\n\r\n[183] Catalogue No. 21.\r\n\r\n[184] _Waffenkunde_, p. 557.\r\n\r\n[185] “_Er_ [the Emperor] _hat auch under den pundten vilmal gerennt\r\nda im treffens baid shilt in de höch sprungen, das dann lustig ist zu\r\nsehen, aber sorgklich zu thun_.”\r\n\r\n[186] The word _Anzogenrennen_ means merely jousting with the shield\r\nscrewed on (_Angeschraubte Tartsche_).\r\n\r\n[187] Vol. LV, page 297.\r\n\r\n[188] LVI, page 276.\r\n\r\n[189] _The Armouries at the Tower of London_, I, 18.\r\n\r\n[190] This duel is described in Chapter V.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\n_L’Histoire Du Bon Chevalier, Sans Paour et Sans Reproche, Gentil\r\nSeigneur De Bayart_, gives some account of Bayard’s combats in the\r\nlists. The Chevalier was born in 1476 and died in 1524, and his first\r\nfights on foot and on horseback took place when he was a raw, growing\r\nstripling of eighteen. This was on the occasion when the Burgundian\r\nChevalier, Claude de Vauldray, came to Lyons in 1494 to accomplish a\r\ndeed of arms—“_à course de lance et coups de hache_”; and the young\r\nBayard, though without possessing an equipment for the joust or means\r\nof procuring one, conceived the idea of engaging this redoubted\r\nchampion in combat. The difficulty as to horse and armour was solved\r\nby the coming forward of a kinsman, L’Abbe d’Esnay, with the necessary\r\ncash. After several chevaliers of the French court had encountered De\r\nVauldray, Bayard entered the lists to do battle. No particulars of the\r\ncombat itself are given by the chronicler, but the account states that\r\nthe youngster bore himself right gallantly; and the verdict of the\r\nladies on the stand erected for their accommodation, expressed in the\r\nLyonese dialect, “_Vey-vo cestou malotru, il a mieulx fay que tous los\r\nautres_.”\r\n\r\nSoon the young Bayard, advancing towards fame and fortune, caused a\r\nproclamation to be made for a _pas d’armes_ to be held at the town of\r\nAyre, in Picardy, on the 20th July, 1494, _Pour l’amour des dames_.\r\nThe articles of combat provided that “hoasting” armour be worn, and on\r\nthe first day three courses be run with rebated lances and afterwards\r\ntwelve strokes exchanged with the sword, all on horseback; on the\r\nmorrow the combats to be on foot at barriers, high as the _nombril_,\r\nwith lances and later with axes. Prizes were offered to the successful\r\ncompetitors as follows:—For the first day a bracelet of gold, enamelled\r\nwith Bayard’s device, of the value of thirty _ecus_; and for the second\r\nday a diamond worth forty _ecus_. The proclamation runs:—\r\n\r\n    “_Pierre de Bayart, jeune gentil-homme et apprentif des\r\n      armes, natif de Daulphiné, des ordonnances du roy\r\n      de France, soubz la charge et_ _conduicte de hault\r\n      et puissant Seigneur monseigneur de Ligny, faisoit\r\n      crier et publier ung tourney au dehors de la ville\r\n      d’Ayre, et joignant les murailles à tous venans, au\r\n      vingtiesme jour de juillet, de trois coups de lance\r\n      sans lice, à fer esmolu, et en harnoys de guerre; et\r\n      douze coups d’espée, le tout à cheval. Et au mieulx\r\n      faisant donnoit ung brasselet d’or esmaillé de sa\r\n      livrée, et du prix de trente escuz. Le lendemain\r\n      seriot combatu à pied, a poux de lance, à une\r\n      barrière de la halteur du nombril; et après la lance\r\n      rompue à coups de hache, jusques à la discrétion\r\n      des juges et de ceulx qui garderoient le camp. Et\r\n      au mieulx faisoit donnoit ung dyamant du pris de\r\n      quarante escus._”\r\n\r\nOn the first day, on the trumpet sounding, _le bon Chevalier_ presented\r\nhimself for the first course, his adversary being a neighbour from\r\nDauphiny named Tartarin, in which the latter broke his lance within\r\nsix inches of the head, thus forfeiting a point; and jousting between\r\nother cavaliers lasted until evening. On the second day Bayard fought\r\nat barriers against a Messire Honotin de Sucre, first with lances and\r\nafterwards with axes. Bayard struck his adversary two heavy blows over\r\nthe region of the ear, the second of which bore him to the ground.\r\nOther foot encounters followed, after which the prizes for the two\r\ndays were awarded by the judges to _le bon Chevalier_, as having done\r\nthe best on both days, but he refused to accept them, and they were\r\nadjudged to other champions who came next in order of merit.[191] The\r\nChevalier’s next tourney was at Carignan, in Italy, at which he gained\r\nthe prize.[192]\r\n\r\nChapter XXII tells how _le bon Chevalier_ fought at barriers at Andre\r\nwith Don Alonce de Soto-Majori. Bayard had wished the combat to be on\r\nhorseback, owing to some trouble in his legs which hindered locomotion;\r\nbut the Spaniard insisted all the more on fighting on foot, and this\r\nwas finally arranged to take place. The weapons selected were estocs\r\nand daggers, and the fight commenced with an exchange of thrusts with\r\nthe former, in which Soto-Majori was slightly wounded in the face; then\r\nBayard, making a feint, thrust his sword right through the neck of his\r\nadversary, inflicting a fatal wound. The Spaniard, in his death agony,\r\nclutched the body of the Frenchman with his arms and both combatants\r\nfell to the ground. Bayard then drew his dagger, crying, “_Rendez\r\nvous, Seigneur Alonce, ou vous estes mort_”; but he had hardly uttered\r\nthe words when the Spaniard expired. The Chevalier then knelt down and\r\nthanked God for his victory.\r\n\r\nThe Chevalier’s next combat was at Monervyne, in the Kingdom of\r\nNaples, thirteen Spaniards against the same number of Frenchmen,\r\nwhich took place during a truce between the two armies, the leaders\r\nof this encounter being the Seigneur d’Oroze and _le bon Chevalier_\r\nrespectively. A condition of the articles of combat was that any\r\ncavalier on being unhorsed should render himself a prisoner to the side\r\nopposing him. The fight began, and the Spaniards unchivalrously aimed\r\ntheir lances at the horses of their adversaries instead of at their\r\nriders; but, in spite of this dishonourable ruse, the honours of the\r\nbattle are stated to have lain with the Frenchmen.\r\n\r\nOther examples of Bayard’s prowess and chivalry in the tournament are\r\ngiven in the chronicle. The dates given by chroniclers of jousts and\r\n_pas d’armes_ are apt to vary somewhat, partly owing to the different\r\nmethods of computing the regnant years of a king.\r\n\r\nA manuscript in the College of Arms, London, gives an account of\r\nthe _pas d’armes_ held at Westminster in honour of the marriage of\r\nKatharine of Arragon with Prince Arthur, the heir to the throne, in the\r\nseventeenth year of King Henry VII (1501). This narration is apparently\r\nthe work of an official present at the meeting, and an abridged account\r\nof it follows here. Besides jousts and _mêlées_, there were fights at\r\nbarriers, pageants, and mummeries most splendid, costly, fanciful and\r\nelaborate. A tilt was erected in the open space before Westminster\r\nHall, and adjoining the lists were gaily decorated stands and galleries\r\nfor the king, court and other spectators. For the knights, nobles and\r\nesquires taking part there were within the lists pavilions, which\r\nwere removed before the jousting began. The first jousting is thus\r\ndescribed:—\r\n\r\n      “And at furst curse ran the Duke of Bokyngham and\r\n    the Lord Marquyes; and the duke brake his staff right\r\n    well, and wt great sleight and stringht, upon the Lord\r\n    Marquyes; and at the secunde curse the Lord Marquyes\r\n    brake his staff oppon the Duke in like wise; and then\r\n    the residue of the Lords and Knights ranne orderly\r\n    togiders, and, for the most parte at every curse, other\r\n    the on staf, other the other, or moost comonly bothe,\r\n    were goodly and wt great art and strength, brokyn of\r\n    meny pecys; that such a feld, and justs ryall, so\r\n    noble and valiantly doon, have not been sene ne hard;\r\n    the which goodly feats, and those of the descripcion\r\n    apperyth weil pleynn, and more opyn, in the bokys of\r\n    the Harolds of Armys.”\r\n\r\nThere is nothing said of the lances employed in the first day’s\r\njousting, as to whether they were rebated or not, but the courses\r\nwhich follow on the succeeding days are expressly stated to have been\r\nrun with pointed lances “at the large.”[193] We may thus assume that\r\nthe running of the first day was at the tilt (else why its erection at\r\nall?), and that lances with coronals were employed. Afterwards there\r\nwas a _mêlée_, the weapons being “armyng swords” (i.e. _estocs_). On\r\nthe fourth day jousting was again followed by a tourney (_mêlée_).[194]\r\nThe lances were tipped with coronals, and the weapons in the tourney\r\nwere estocs, as before. Many of the cavaliers were unhorsed in the\r\njousting and in the _mêlée_: “Sume of their swords were brokyn in two\r\npeces, and sume other their harneis was heuen off from their body, and\r\nfelle into the feld.” Then the prizes, consisting of diamonds, rubies\r\nand rings of gold, were awarded.\r\n\r\nIn 1502 a “Solemne Triumphe” was held in the Tower of London.\r\n\r\nPlate 118 in _Das Turnierbuch Johan des Beständigen, Kurfürst_ of\r\nSaxony, depicts a course with sharp lances, run at Naumburg in 1505,\r\nbetween Duke Hans of Saxony and Georg von Brandestein. The duke keeps\r\nhis seat, but his opponent is unhorsed. The armour is of the kind\r\nusually employed in this course (_Scharfrennen_).\r\n\r\nIn the _Turnierhuch_ of Duke William of Bavaria is a picture of an\r\n_Anzogenrennen_, held in the year 1512. The body-armour employed is\r\nthat used in all the varieties of _Rennen_, though the shield in\r\nthis course is much larger than in the others, extending up to the\r\n_ocularium_ of the jousting-salade, thus covering the face. This shield\r\nhas been described under the heading _Anzogenrennen_. The armour with\r\nthe shield is illustrated by Boeheim.[195]\r\n\r\nThere was jousting at Paris in 1513, at which the Duc de Valois was the\r\nchief tenant, and many courses were run.[196]\r\n\r\nJousts were held at Lille, in the same year, in a large hall paved\r\nwith black marble, and the horses were shod with felt to prevent their\r\nslipping.[197]\r\n\r\nIn 1515, in honour of the marriage of the king, jousts took place at\r\nParis, which had been proclaimed by the Dauphin, as follows:—\r\n\r\n      “Nemelie, that he with nine aides should answer\r\n    all commers, being gentlemen of name and armes.\r\n    First, to run fiue courses at the tilt with péeces\r\n    of advantage[198]; after fiue courses at random[199]\r\n    with sharpe speares, and twelue strokes with sharpe\r\n    swords; and that doone, he and his aids to fight at the\r\n    barriers with all gentlemen of name and armes. First,\r\n    six foins with hand speares, and after that eight\r\n    strokes to the most aduantage if the speares so long\r\n    held, and after that twelue strokes with the sword; and\r\n    if any man be vnhorsed or felled with fighting on foot,\r\n    then his horse and armour to be rendered to the officer\r\n    of armes; and eueri man of this challenge must set\r\n    vp his armes and name vpon an arch triumphant, which\r\n    shalbe made at the place where the iusts shalbe, and\r\n    further shall write to what point he will answer, to\r\n    one or all.”\r\n\r\nWhen this _fête d’armes_ was proclaimed in England, “the duke of\r\nSuffolke, the marquis of Dorset and his four brethrern, the lord\r\nClinton, sir Edward Neuille, sir Giles Capell, Thomas Cheneie\r\nand others sued the king to be at the chalenge, which request he\r\ngratiouslie granted.” “The Dolphin desired the duke of Suffolke and the\r\nmarquess Dorset to be two of his immediate aids, which they thereto\r\nassented.” Four shields were set up—viz. silver, gold, black and\r\ntawny—under which the venans were to write their names, electing, in\r\ntheir order, whether to run at the tilt, in the open with sharp lances,\r\nto fight on foot with one-handed swords, or lastly, with two-handers.\r\nThis _pas d’armes_ continued over three days, during which 305\r\ncavaliers each ran five courses, some with sharp lances, and several\r\nwere killed. In the joust in the open the Duke of Suffolk wounded an\r\nantagonist almost to the death. The Dauphin was wounded in the hand,\r\nso that he was unable to take further part. Many other particulars and\r\ndetails of this passage of arms are given by Holinshed.[200]\r\n\r\nAmong the Ashmolean MSS. is one relating to the proclamation of\r\njousts to be held at a later date and to letters of safeguard issued\r\nto intending venans. The document is of the year 1520, and runs as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n      “The lettres of savegarde given by the said King of\r\n    England [Henry VIII] unto Thomas Walle al’s Norrey\r\n    King of Armes, for the proclamacōn of the same Ioustes\r\n    in the parties of Almayn and the contrye of Germania,\r\n    wch Norrey proclaimed thē welle in French for the lowe\r\n    contreys, as in High Dutch as hereafter followeth\r\n    ＆c.”[201]\r\n\r\nIn foot contests there was a rule that no one who had seen a challenger\r\nfight on foot on any previous occasion was allowed to engage him. It is\r\ndifficult to understand the reason for this condition, and it was often\r\nwaived on permission being given by an intended opponent.\r\n\r\nCharles V, in January, 1518, two years before he became emperor, took\r\npart in a tournament at which twelve horses were killed; and in another\r\nin the March following, when seven cavaliers lost their lives.[202]\r\n\r\nHenry VIII, like his friend Maximilian of Austria, took great delight\r\nin the tourney and in the pageantry so frequently combined with it, and\r\nmuch money and labour was expended in staging the many functions of\r\nthe kind held during his reign. Henry greatly encouraged these martial\r\ngames and frequently took part in them; indeed, Hall remarks “that the\r\nking was not minded to see young gentlemen inexpert in martial feats.”\r\nThis chronicler positively revels in picturing these brilliant scenes,\r\ndevoting himself more especially to their spectacular aspect, and\r\ngiving full details of the dresses and equipment of those taking part,\r\ntogether with particulars of the general surroundings, though little\r\nis said of the martial games themselves. The pageantry and mummeries\r\nassociated with the tournament were often of almost incredible\r\npuerility, and they detracted greatly from the dignity of these warlike\r\nsports. There were many childish conceits at these gatherings, all\r\nshowing that the tourney had reached an advanced stage of its decline.\r\nSuch costly shows went greatly out of fashion after the death of Henry\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\nJousts, combined with pageants, were held in honour of the coronation\r\nof the king, and Holinshed thus describes them:—“For the more honour\r\nand innobling of the triumphant coronation, there were prepared both\r\niusts and turneis to be doone in the palace of Westminster, where, for\r\nthe king’s grace and the queen’s, was framed a faire house, couered\r\nwith tapestrie, and hanged with rich clothe of Arras, and in the said\r\npalace was made a curious founteine and ouer it a castell, on the top\r\nthereof a great crowne imperiall, all the imbatelling with roses and\r\npomgranats gilded,” and many other conceits.\r\n\r\nThe tenans in the jousting on this occasion were Thomas, Lord Howard;\r\nhis brother, Sir Edward Howard; Lord Richard, the Admiral; Lord\r\nRichard, brother to the Marquis of Dorset; Sir Edmund Howard; Sir\r\nThomas Knevit and Charles Brandon, Esquire. Their bases and trappers\r\nwere of green velvet, charged with roses and pomegranates of gold\r\nfringed with damask gilded.\r\n\r\nThe venans were Sir John Pechie, Sir Edward Neville, Sir Edward\r\nGuildford, Sir John Carr, Sir William Parr, Sir Giles Capell, Sir\r\nGriffith Dun and Sir Roulande. Their bases and trappers were of tissue,\r\ncloth of gold, silver and velvet.\r\n\r\nThe second day was devoted to the _mêlée_. No details of the jousting\r\nitself or of the tourney are given. Both Hall and Holinshed describe\r\nthis meeting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE IX_\r\n\r\nA HARNESS FOR THE GERMAN JOUST. WALLACE COLLECTION]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUIT IN THE WALLACE COLLECTION FOR JOUSTING AT THE\r\nTILT]\r\n\r\nOn the twelfth of January following jousts were held in the park at\r\nRichmond “vnknown to the kynges grace, whereof, he beyng secretly\r\ninformed, caused hymself and one of his priue chambre, called Willyā\r\nCompton to be secretly armed, and so came into the Iustes vnknowen\r\nto all persones and vnloked for. The kyng ranne neuer openly before,\r\nand there were broken many staues, and greate praise geuen to the two\r\nstraungers, but specially to one, whiche was the kyng.” “Master Compton\r\nwas sore hurte and likely to dye.”[203]\r\n\r\nHolinshed tells us that in May, 1510, the king with his aides\r\nchallenged all comers to fight at barriers at Greenwich, viz. casting\r\nthe spear and twelve strokes with two-handed swords. Henry much\r\ndistinguished himself by his great strength and judgment.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th November in the same year Henry, with Charles Brandon and\r\n“Mayster” Compton, answered all comers for two days, the first at the\r\ntilt, the second at the tourney. “At these iusts the king brake more\r\nstaves than any other, and therefore had the pryse: at the Turney in\r\nlikewyse the honor was his.”[204]\r\n\r\nThe original Roll of the “Iusts” held at Westminster on the 13th\r\nFebruary, 1511, in honour of Queen “Katherin” on the birth of Prince\r\nHenry, is now in the College of Arms, London. It is of parchment, 14½\r\ninches broad, the figures of the combatants and others being from seven\r\nto eight inches in height; and the whole is in an excellent state of\r\npreservation. The roll is headed with the words “Viue le noble Roy H.\r\nVIII,” followed by a large device of a rose and pomegranates surmounted\r\nby a crown, impaled with the letters H and K. Some of the figures are\r\narmed at all points, while others are in civil dress, thus constituting\r\nan invaluable record of the costumes of the day.\r\n\r\nThe picture of the procession to the lists is headed by “Le Maistre\r\nde Armurerye du Roy,” in civil dress, with his guard, and immediately\r\nafter him follow the sergeant-at-arms, holding his crowned bâton of\r\noffice; then five trumpeters, one of them a negro. In their order march\r\nafter them a band of courtiers, and “Les Officiers d’Armes,” being\r\nheralds and pursuivants, in tabard-shaped surcoats. Then come the four\r\ntenans, each riding under a “Pauilion,” with their varlets. Two led\r\nhorses immediately follow the king, and they afford a good opportunity\r\nfor observing the saddles employed in jousting at the tilt. After them\r\nride “Les pages du Roy,” the marshal of the lists, “Le grant Escuyer,”\r\nand “Le maistre des Pages.” The tenans are seen approaching the\r\ngaily-decorated stand, in which the queen and her court are seated, and\r\nthe venans are reaching it on the other side. The picture closes with\r\nthe king on horseback in civil dress—“Le Roy desarmey”—holding a broken\r\nlance in his hand. He is preceded by his helm-bearer, on horseback,\r\ncarrying the head-piece of his majesty on a truncheon. The helm is\r\nsurmounted by a royal crown, enriched with gold, pearls, diamonds and\r\nrubies.\r\n\r\nThe roll concludes with a poem, in which the name of the king figures\r\namong a band of heroes, the others being Hector, Cæsar, Judas\r\nMaccabæus, Joshua, Charlemagne, King Arthur, Alexander, David and\r\nCodefroi de Bouillon.\r\n\r\nThe “tenantz” were—\r\n\r\n    His Grace the King      (Cœur Loyal),\r\n    Lord William of Devon   (Bon Vouloir),\r\n    Sir Thomas Knevit       (Valliant Desyr),\r\n    Sir Edward Nevyle       (Joyeulx Penser).\r\n\r\nThey all subscribed to the articles of combat, which follow here—\r\n\r\n      “And for as moche as after the order ＆ Honnor of Arms\r\n    hyt is not lefull for any man to enterpryse Arms in so\r\n    high a presens without hys Stocke and name be of Nobles\r\n    dyscended.

Jousting began on the twelfth, and on\r\nthe morrow there was a grand procession to the lists. The king was on\r\nhorseback, armed at all points, riding under a “Pauilion” of cloth of\r\ngold and purple velvet, embroidered and powdered over with the letters\r\n“H” and “K” of fine gold, surmounted by an imperial golden crown and\r\nvalanced with hanging wire of the same precious metal. The king’s bases\r\nand the trapper of his charger were of cloth of gold, fretted with\r\ndamask gold; his crinet and chamfron were of steel, and on the latter\r\nwas a plume garnished with golden spangles. Then followed his three\r\naides, each riding under a “Pauilion” of crimson damask and purple,\r\npowdered over with the letters “H” and “K” in fine gold, valanced and\r\nfringed with damask gold, and on the top of each canopy a great “K”\r\nof goldsmith’s work. After them marched a number of gentlemen and\r\nyeomen on foot, clad in russet and yellow cloth; then twelve children\r\nof honour, mounted on great coursers richly caparisoned. Then in the\r\ncounterpart rode the “venantz,” headed by Sir Charles Brandon,[207]\r\nwho appears first on horseback in a long robe of russet satin, like\r\na recluse, and he petitions the queen for permission to joust in her\r\npresence. His request having been granted, he doffed his cloak and\r\nappeared in full armour, with rich bases, and his horse nobly trapped\r\nfor running at the tilt. In attendance on him were divers men clad in\r\nrusset satin. Next came young Henry Guilford, Esquire, himself and\r\nhorse in russet cloth of gold and cloth of silver, embroidered with a\r\ndevice like a castle or turret, and all his men in russet satin and\r\nwhite, with hose of the same and bonnets of a like colour; and he\r\nalso petitioned the queen for permission to run. After him rode the\r\nMarquis of Dorset and Sir Thomas Bulleyn,[208] dressed as pilgrims\r\nin tabards of black velvet, with palmer’s hats over their helmets and\r\nlong Jacob’s staffs in their hands. Their horses were trapped in black\r\nvelvet, which, like their hats and tabards, was garnished with scallop\r\nshells of fine gold; their servants were in black satin, with the\r\nsame kind of shells pinned to their breasts. Then came Lord Henry of\r\nBuckingham, Earl of Wiltshire, himself and his horse draped in cloth\r\nof silver, embroidered with a “posye” of golden arrows and roses, and\r\nabove the flowers the figure of a greyhound in silver holding a tree of\r\npomegranates in gold. Then entered Sir Giles Capell, Sir Roulande and\r\nmany other knights, richly armed and apparelled.\r\n\r\nThe jousting began and was gallantly achieved, the prize being awarded\r\nto the king. The proceedings were followed by music and the dance,\r\nclosing with a pageant.[209] What a contrast between this passage of\r\narms and the tournament held in 1278, _temp._ Edward I, as described in\r\nChapter II.\r\n\r\nAshmole, No. 1116, fol. 109-10b, runs as follows:—“Iustes holden at\r\nWestminster the XIIth daie of February by the Kinges grace called Cueur\r\nLoyal, the Lord William of Devon Bon Voloir, Sir Thomas Knevit Valiant\r\nDesire, and Edward Nevell Joyous Penser, with the articles and courses\r\nof the said Iustes,” etc. The articles begin thus—“The noble lady\r\nRenowne considering the good and gracious fortune....” The “courses”\r\n(checques) were tilting tablets for recording the scores for two days\r\n(Wednesday and Thursday, February 12th, 13th, 1511), marked with\r\nstrokes, and accounts of the “best Ioustres.”\r\n\r\nIn the tournament illustrated on the Herald’s College Roll it is stated\r\nthat 264 courses were run at the tilt and but 129 attaints made.\r\nThe tenans scored seventy-seven of these, the king himself making\r\nthirty-eight hits out of fifty-two courses. Of the venans, one made no\r\nhits at all and six only struck once in six courses.[210]\r\n\r\nAnother meeting took place on the 1st May following, at which the\r\ntenans were the king, Sir Edward Howard, Charles Brandon and Sir Edward\r\nNevil; the venans being the Earl of Essex, the Earl of Devon, the\r\nMarquis of Dorset and Lord Howard.[211]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE X_\r\n\r\nGERMAN ARMOUR FOR JOUSTING AT THE TILT. AT DRESDEN.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN ARMOUR FOR _FREITURNIER_. AT DRESDEN.]\r\n\r\nIn the fourth year of King Henry’s reign—\r\n\r\n    “the King had a solempne iust at Grenewiche in Iune:\r\n    first came in ladies all in White and Red silke, set\r\n    vpon Coursers trapped in the same suite, freated ouer\r\n    with gold, after which folowed a Fountain curiously\r\n    made of Russet sattin, with eight Gargilles spoutyng\r\n    water, within the fountain sat a knight armed at all\r\n    peces. After the Fountain folowed a lady all in black\r\n    silke dropped with fine siluer, on a courser trapped\r\n    in the same. After folowed a knight in a horse litter,\r\n    the Coursers and litter apparareled in blacke velvet\r\n    with siluer droppes. When the Fountain came to the\r\n    tilt, the Ladies rode rounde aboute, and so did the\r\n    Fountain and the knight within the litter. And after\r\n    them wer brought twoo goodly Coursers appareled for\r\n    the iusts: and when they came to the tiltes ende, the\r\n    twoo knightes mounted on the two Coursers, abidyng all\r\n    commers. The king was in the fountain and Sir Charles\r\n    Brandon was in the litter. Then suddenly with great\r\n    noyse of the Trompets, entered Sir Thomas Kneuit in\r\n    a castle of cole blacke, and ouer the castell was\r\n    written, ‘The dolorous Castle,’ and so he and the erle\r\n    of Essex, the lorde Haward and other ran their courses,\r\n    with the King and Sir Charles Brandon and euer the king\r\n    brake moste speres.”[212]\r\n\r\nThere were royal jousts held in October, 1513, the king and Lord Lisle\r\nanswering all comers. His Majesty was attended by twenty-four knights\r\nclad in robes of purple velvet and cloth of gold, and many lances were\r\nbroken.[213]\r\n\r\nIn 1515 Henry, with the Marquis of Dorset, challenged all comers to a\r\njoust, and the king “brake three and twentie speres beside attaints and\r\nbare downe to ground a man of armes and his horse.”[214]\r\n\r\nIn the same year on twelfth-night the king held a _Scharmützel_, being\r\nthe attack and defence of a mock fortress, at Eltham.[215]\r\n\r\nRoyal jousts were held again in June, 1519, at which 506 lances were\r\nsplintered.[216]\r\n\r\nRoyal jousts in March, 1520.[217]\r\n\r\nIn the eighth year of his reign the king proclaimed solemn jousts in\r\nhonour of his sister, the Queen of Scotland,[218] to extend over two\r\ndays. The tenans on the first day were the king himself, the Duke of\r\nSuffolk, the Earl of Essex and Nicholas Carew, Esquire. The venans\r\nnumbered twelve. On the second day the king ran against Sir William\r\nKingston, a tall and strong knight, and unhorsed him. The apparel of\r\nthe tenans and their horses “was blacke velvet, covered all over with\r\nbraunches of honey suckels of fine flat gold of damaske, of lose worke,\r\nevery lefe of the braunch moving, the embroudery was very conning and\r\nsumptuous.”[219][220]\r\n\r\nThere was another passage of arms in the year following, at which 506\r\nlances were splintered.[221]\r\n\r\nThe following documents occur among the Harleian MSS.:—“Justs at\r\nGreenwich, the 20th daie of Maye, the 8th yeare of the Raigne of our\r\nSoveraigne Ld. K. Henry VIII.” The score of each jouster is given.\r\n\r\n“_Coppye de Chapitres (ou Articles) des certaine Faits d’Armes, tant a\r\nPied, comme a Cheval, qui par deux Gentilmomes d’Almaigne touchant une\r\ncertaine Emprise._”[222]\r\n\r\nThe jousts and tourneys of the Field of the Cloth of Gold were held\r\non a truly magnificent scale, and, indeed, everything was done to\r\nmake them a triumphant spectacular success. The cavaliers of the\r\ntwo nations, like the ladies present, vied with each other in the\r\nrichness of their dresses and appointments, and the two monarchs\r\ngreatly distinguished themselves in the tiltyard. The lists themselves\r\nare stated to have been 150 paces long, and were placed in a plain\r\nsurrounded by a ditch. Stands were erected for the officials and\r\nspectators, and pavilions were pitched for the use of the cavaliers\r\ntaking part. The jousting was with blunted lances, each challenger to\r\nrun eight courses. The two kings entered the enclosure on June 11th,\r\n1520, armed at all points, at the time appointed. The horse of his\r\nMajesty of France was trapped with purple satin broached with gold and\r\nembroidered with raven’s plumes hatched with gold, and on his helm he\r\nwore a lady’s sleeve. The trapper of the King of England was of cloth\r\nof gold tissue, fringed with damask and knitted together with golden\r\npoints. In attendance on King Henry were Sir Henry Guilford, Master of\r\nthe Horse; Sir John Pechie, Governor of Calais; Sir Edmund Guilford,\r\nGeneral of the Forces; and Monsieur Morel, attached to his suite by\r\nKing Francis. They all wore the royal livery.\r\n\r\nThe jousting began, the onset was sounded, and King Henry ran against\r\nMonsieur Grandevile, and the helm of the Frenchman was fractured. The\r\nDuc de Vendôme ran five courses against the Duke of Suffolk, each\r\nbreaking his lance on the other’s body. After many more jousts had been\r\naccomplished the signal to cease for the day was given, the heralds\r\ncrying “_Desarmée_” and the trumpets sounded _à l’hostel_ (to lodgings).\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, the 12th, ten gentlemen of the French king’s Swiss Guard\r\ntilted against eleven of the band of Monsieur de Tremouille.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, the 13th, the King of France, with his aides, and King\r\nHenry, with his following, rode at the tilt, after which there was much\r\njousting between the knights of France and England; and towards evening\r\nKing Francis left for Ard and the English monarch departed for his\r\ncastle of Guisnes.\r\n\r\nOn the Thursday the French king tilted with the Earl of Devonshire\r\nand others, and King Henry ran against Monsieur Montmorencie and Rafe\r\nBrooke. On the Friday there was fighting at barriers, and on the\r\nSaturday a banquet was given by the French king and his suite at the\r\nCastle of Guisnes. A Frenchman was killed when fighting on foot.\r\n\r\nOn the Monday the fêtes were in abeyance, owing to a great storm,\r\nbut on the Tuesday the two kings came to the lists, armed at all\r\npoints, and jousting was resumed. Wednesday and Thursday were devoted\r\nto the _mêlée_, and on Friday, June 22nd, “the two kings with their\r\nretinues did battle on foot at barriers.”[223] The French cavaliers\r\nwore doublets of cloth of silver and purple velvet, while those of\r\nthe English were of cloth of gold and russet velvet. The weapons were\r\nspears and swords.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, after a banquet, there was again fighting at barriers,\r\nfirst with spears and afterwards with two-handed swords.\r\n\r\nThe _pas d’armes_ was followed by masks, more banqueting and the dance.\r\nBoth Hall and Holinshed describe this historic meeting.\r\n\r\nAmong the Ashmolean MSS. are the following concerning the Field of\r\nthe Cloth of Gold:—“_Ce sont les noms des princes, prellatz, et\r\ngrans seigneurs de France, qui estoient en la compaignie de Roy de\r\nFrance quant le Roy_ [_Henry VIII_] _Dengleterre et led’ sr le Roy_\r\n[_François_] _sentrevyrent et ordonnerent les Iousts et Tournoys qui\r\nsensuyvent_.” Prefixed to the title is a stanza of five lines inviting\r\nto the jousts.\r\n\r\n“The proclamacōn in Frenche of the Articles of the Iustes and other\r\nfeates of armes at the meeting of the aforesaid Kinges [Henry and\r\nFrançois] at Guisnes, proclaimed throughout the realme of France\r\nby Thomas Benolt al’s Clarencieux King of Armes. _Comme ainsi soit\r\nlouange._”[224]\r\n\r\nImperial royal jousts were run in the month of March of the thirteenth\r\nyear of the reign, of which Hall gives an account; and there were\r\nothers in the year following.\r\n\r\nOn March 10th, 1524, King Henry ran a great risk of losing his life\r\nin the tiltyard, for when jousting with Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, he\r\nforgot to shut and clasp down the visor of his helmet. Brandon, who was\r\nshort-sighted, did not perceive this, and in his career aimed his lance\r\nat that part of the king’s head-piece, striking it at the side of the\r\nface, unhelming his Majesty, though without causing him any injury. As\r\nalready mentioned, in a joust held on Shrove Tuesday in the year 1525\r\nSir Charles Bryan nearly lost an eye from a somewhat similar cause.\r\n\r\nKing Henry, like his friend Maximilian of Austria, is always\r\nrepresented as the successful jouster, and, although his strength,\r\nskill and good fortune are generally admitted, some explanation is\r\nrequired to account for his invariable success. It has been suggested\r\nthat it may have been due in some measure to the prerogative of the\r\nqueen, by which a joust could be stopped if there should be any\r\nprobability of the king’s defeat.[225]\r\n\r\n      “On May-day _anno_ 1536 was a great jousting held\r\n    at Greenwich, at which the chief challenger was the\r\n    Lord Rochford, the queen’s brother; and the defendant\r\n    was one Henry Norris, of the king’s bed-chamber, with\r\n    others. They managed their arms with great dexterity,\r\n    and every course which they ran came off with the loud\r\n    applause of the people.”[226]\r\n\r\n      “Another solemne Challenge was proclaimed and\r\n    perfourmed by certaine English Knights, viz. Sir John\r\n    Dudley,[227] Sir Thomas Seimer, Sir Francis Poynings, Sir\r\n    George Carew, Anthony Kingston and Richard Cromwel.\r\n    _Anno_ 1540.”\r\n\r\nRoyal jousts were run on the thirty-first year of the reign, in\r\ncelebration of the king’s marriage with Anne of Clѐves.\r\n\r\nLacroix, in _Military and Religious Life in the Middle Ages_, pictures\r\nthe degradation of a knight convicted of dishonourable conduct, copied\r\nfrom a wood-cut bearing the initials “J. A.” (Jost Amman). The culprit\r\nis exposed on a scaffold, clad only in his shirt, his armour is broken\r\nin pieces before him and thrown at his feet, and his spurs are cast\r\nupon a dunghill. His shield is dragged by a cart-horse through the\r\nmire, and the tail of his _destrier_ cut off. A herald-at-arms cries\r\nthree times, “Who is there?” and each time the name of the knight is\r\ngiven. The herald then cries, “No, it is not so; I see no knight, but\r\nonly a false coward.” The culprit is borne on a litter into a church,\r\nwhere the burial service is read over him, and the world of chivalry\r\nknows him no more.\r\n\r\nThere is no record of any royal jousts on the accession of Edward VI\r\nto the throne, and such pastimes would seem to have been greatly in\r\nabeyance during that short reign.\r\n\r\nThe same would seem to have been the case during the reign of Queen\r\nMary; but there were fights at barriers in 1554, when Philip II\r\narrived in England. The challengers, against all comers, were Don\r\nFredericke de Toledo, the Lord Strange, Don Ferdinando de Toledo, Don\r\nFrancisco de Mendoça, and Garsulace de la Vega.\r\n\r\nThe prizes were as follows, viz.:—\r\n\r\n    “1. He who cometh forth most gallantly, though without\r\n        superfluities, shall have a rich brooch.\r\n     2. The best stroke with the pike shall have a ring with\r\n        a ruby.\r\n     3. The best stroke with the sword shall have a ring\r\n        with a diamond.\r\n     4. He that fighteth most valiantly shall have a ring\r\n        with a diamond.\r\n     5. The prize of all together in rank at the foyle was a\r\n        ring of gold with a rich diamond.\r\n     He that giveth a stroke with a pike from the girdle\r\n        downwards shall win no prize.\r\n     He that shall have a close gauntlet or anything to\r\n        fasten his sword to his hand shall win no prize.\r\n     He whose sword falls out of his hand shall win no prize.\r\n     He that striketh his hand in fight on the barriers\r\n        shall win no prize.\r\n     Whosoever shall fight and not show his sword to the\r\n        judges shall win no prize.”\r\n\r\n     The prizes were thus awarded by the judges, in the\r\n        above order, to:—\r\n                           Don Fredericke de Toledo.\r\n                           Don Diego Ortado di Mendoça.\r\n                           Sir John Parrat.\r\n                           Ruygomez.[228] And\r\n                           King Philip, in highest honour.[229]\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of Queen Elizabeth vigorous efforts were made to\r\nrevive the ancient glories of the tournament, which were for a time not\r\nwithout a certain measure of success, under the auspices of the maiden\r\nqueen. Sir Henry Lee rode as the queen’s champion until advancing years\r\ncaused him to relinquish the self-imposed office in favour of the Earl\r\nof Cumberland, who wore a glove of her Majesty’s on his helmet.\r\n\r\nA drawing, from a MS., of tilting, tourney and barriers is reproduced\r\nin Lord Dillon’s paper in the _Archæological Journal_, Vol. LV, which\r\naffords a good deal of information regarding the detail of such combats\r\nduring the reign.\r\n\r\nThere were jousts and barriers on the accession of Queen Elizabeth\r\nto the throne in 1558, in which the Duke of Norfolk and the earls of\r\nSurrey, Warwick and Leicester took part.[230]\r\n\r\nThe _fête d’armes_ at which Henri II of France was fatally injured was\r\nheld at Paris in 1559. The tenans on the occasion were the king, the\r\nPrince of Ferrera, the Duke of Guise and others. The course in which\r\nthe accident befel was an extra one, run in the face of remonstrances\r\non the part of the other challengers. The cause of the injury would\r\nseem to have been that the Comte de Montgomeri, Captain of the Scottish\r\nGuard, failed to drop his shivered lance immediately after impact, as\r\nhe ought to have done, and the jagged end striking the king’s visor,\r\na splinter passed through the slit for vision and pierced his brain.\r\nThe king’s case was hopeless from the first, though he lingered in\r\nagony for nearly a week. The king’s accidental death was not avenged\r\non Montgomeri at the time, but Catherine de Medici had him executed\r\nfifteen years later. Lacroix, in _Military and Religious Life in the\r\nMiddle Ages_, gives a picture of this fatal encounter, copied from an\r\nengraving of the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nViscount Dillon, in his paper “Barriers and Foot Combats,” reproduces\r\na picture of Spanish officers “At Barriers” in Brussels, 1569 (after\r\nHogenberg). The details are interesting as showing the manner of\r\nfighting on foot at the time.\r\n\r\nAs stated in the Ashmolean MS., No. 837, fol. 245, a tournament\r\nwas proclaimed at Hampton Court by Clarencieulx, King of Arms,\r\non Twelfth-night, _anno_ 1570, to take place in the month of May\r\nfollowing. The MS. begins with a preamble, being a general exhortation\r\nto revive the tournament, which “had of late fallen a sleepe.” Next\r\ncome the _chapitres d’armes_ (the articles) for the tilt, tourney and\r\nbarriers. A copy of the document follows here:—\r\n\r\n      “For as much most noble Queene, as ther ar within\r\n    this yoʳ maᵗⁱᵉˢ Courte a greate nombre of noble menne\r\n    and gentlemenne excellent men of Armes, and yet (as it\r\n    wer) of late fallen a sleepe from eny kinde of such\r\n    exercyse: Therfore by your maᵗⁱᵉˢ lycense, to revyve\r\n    theim withall, ther ar fower Knightes Errant which haue\r\n    thought goode to challenge all commers at Shrovetyde\r\n    next as followeth.

On the back of the\r\n    page, which is written by Glover, a second hand has\r\n    written, the other way up:—]\r\n\r\n      The proclemacion that was procleamed at hampton\r\n    court by Clarencieulx Kyng of armes on twelffe daye at\r\n    nyght in Aᵒ/1570/ the chalengers names was the erle of\r\n    Oxfford Charles howard Sʳ henry Lee and christoffer\r\n    hatton a pencioner.\r\n\r\n      Theys excercyses was not Fulffylled tyle maye deye\r\n    next after on which daye was the tylte at westmynster\r\n    and the second daye of maye the torney and on Sonday\r\n    byeing the vj of maye the barrioures.”\r\n\r\nAnother MS. in the same collection (No. 845, fol. 164) gives a list\r\nof the participants, with their “checques” (which are tablets for\r\nrecording the scores made). Examples of these registers are given here,\r\nunder the heading of the document in question:—\r\n\r\n    [Endorsed:—Tournay.\r\n\r\n            Two blowes at the passage: and tenne at the ioyninge:\r\n         All gryppes shockes and foule playe forbidden.]\r\n\r\n                    [A list of names is also on folio 164 b.]\r\n\r\n    [fol. 164.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCORING “CHEQUES.”]\r\n\r\n    [54 more, as above, 25 without arms.]\r\n\r\nThe tenans on the occasion were the Earl of Oxford, Lord Charles\r\nHoward, Sir Henry Lee, and Christopher Hatton, a “pencioner,” and\r\na list of their opponents, with their “Checques,” is given in the\r\nAshmolean MS. No. 845, fol. 167. (See page 128.)\r\n\r\nThe prize for the best lance among the tilters was “a cheyne of gold,”\r\nwhich fell to the Earl of Oxford, who ran forty-two courses and\r\nsplintered thirty-two lances, a very good performance. The prize for\r\nthe tourney was a “Diamonde”; that for “barriours” a “Rubie,” which was\r\nwon by Thomas Cecil, one of the venans.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE XI_\r\n\r\nHARNESSES FOR JOUSTING AT THE TILT. AT PARIS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIELD HARNESS OF ANNE DE MONTMORENCY.]\r\n\r\nIn 1590, after the siege of Paris had been raised, King Henri IV\r\nchallenged the Duc de Mayenne to single combat, in order that by a\r\ndecisive result the calamities of France might be stayed, but nothing\r\ncame of it.\r\n\r\nA tournament was held at Westminster under the leadership of Walter,\r\nEarl of Essex, which is chiefly remarkable from the fact of its\r\nhaving taken place during the night. It was on the occasion when Anne\r\nde Montmorency, Constable of France, came to London to receive the\r\nOrder of the Garter, in June, 1572. Queen Elizabeth gave a supper in\r\ncelebration of the event, at which she presided, and in due time she\r\nretired to her apartments. The weather being warm, however, it pleased\r\nher Majesty to walk from her chamber on to the open terrace of the\r\npalace, where the French duke and his suite were assembled, with many\r\nof the English courtiers. The Earl of Essex entered the terrace quite\r\nsuddenly, accompanied by twelve gentlemen armed at all points and well\r\nmounted.\r\n\r\n      “The Earl and his horse were furnished with white\r\n    cloth of siluer, and the rest in white sattin, who\r\n    after reuerence done to her Maiesty, marched to the\r\n    east side of the Court, and there in troope, stood\r\n    firme. Forthwith entered Edward Earle of Rutland, with\r\n    a like number, in like sort armed and apparelled all\r\n    in blew; and hauing presented his reuerence, stayed on\r\n    the west end. Before either of these bands, one Chariot\r\n    was drawen, and therein a faire Damsell, conducted by\r\n    an armed Knight, who pronounced certain speeches in\r\n    the French tongue, vnto her Maiestie. These Ceremonies\r\n    passed, the Queene commanded the armed men to fall vnto\r\n    fight, which they performed with great courage, and\r\n    commendation, chiefly in the Earl of Essex, a noble\r\n    personage, valorous in armes, and all other wayes of\r\n    great vertue.\r\n\r\n      Of the Actors names in this Triumph (it seemeth) no\r\n    note is kept: yet are many of them still liuing.”\r\n\r\nThe ordinances and regulations which controlled the routine of a\r\ntournament, some of them compiled for general use and others framed\r\nfor particular contests, have been repeatedly referred to in these\r\npages; but the method of the keeping of scores is nowhere clearly\r\nindicated, and, indeed, is but rarely mentioned. The score was marked\r\nin strokes by a king of arms, sometimes by a pursuivant,[231] on a\r\nscoring tablet, termed a “checque,” which was tricked with a shield of\r\nthe arms of the owner, as shown on page 127. The scoring-board itself\r\nwas in the form of a parallelogram, with three horizontal lines, the\r\nmiddle line projecting some distance beyond the others, and on the\r\nprojection of this middle line the number of courses run (usually from\r\ntwo to eight) were registered. The attaints were noted on the top\r\nline; and they were often differentiated as hits on the body or head,\r\nwhich had a different value in the tale.[232] The middle line inside\r\nthe parallelogram was for the staves well broken, and the bottom line\r\nfor those “ill-broken”—that is, broken within a foot of the head of\r\nthe lance or on the tilt, on the adversary’s saddle, etc.—these being\r\ndeducted from the score or disallowed. The proportion in the number of\r\nattaints varied greatly, though on the average it would appear that\r\nthe misses made in jousting at the tilt (i.e. when the jousters failed\r\nto touch each other in their careers) were greater in number than the\r\nhits made; while in jousting “at the wide” the proportion of attaints\r\nwas much greater. The registration was done by vertical strokes on the\r\nhorizontal lines.\r\n\r\nAs many as ten jousting cheques have been found, which help to a\r\nknowledge as to how the scoring was managed, though more light is\r\nneeded on the subject.\r\n\r\nThe rules and regulations concerning the conducting of tournaments in\r\nTudor times were based on those framed in 1466 by John Tiptoft, Earl of\r\nWorcester, Constable of England, which are given in our Chapter IV; but\r\nthere is no rule among them directly mentioned concerning the method\r\nof scoring the points. There are, however, pictures of the scoring\r\ncheques, reproduced by Mr. ffoulkes in his paper in _Archæologia_,\r\nVol. LXIII, Plate IV, Nos. 2, 3, which appear at the ends of two of\r\nthe versions of the Tiptoft rules; viz. those in Harl. MS. 2413, fol.\r\n16, and Ashmole MS. 763, fol. 149. Two cheques out of the fifty-six in\r\nAshmole MS. 845, fol. 164, are reproduced on our Fig. 1. They are those\r\nof the Earl of Oxford and Charles Howard, being registers of their\r\nscores at the passage of arms which was proclaimed by Clarencieulx in\r\n1570.\r\n\r\nThis somewhat intricate subject can only be lightly touched upon in\r\nthese pages; but we may refer any of our readers who may wish to pursue\r\nthe subject further to Lord Dillon’s paper, “Tilting in Tudor Times,”\r\npublished in the _Archæological Journal_, Vol. LV, and to that written\r\nby Mr. Charles ffoulkes in _Archæologia_, LXIII, entitled “Jousting\r\nCheques of the Sixteenth Century.”\r\n\r\nThree writers on certain features in the routine of a tournament are\r\nmentioned in the last-named monograph, _The Romance of Three King’s\r\nSons_, written about the end of the fifteenth century,[233] from which\r\nthe following extract is given:—\r\n\r\n      “All these thinges donne thei were embatailed eche\r\n    ageynste the othir and the corde drawen ageynste eche\r\n    partie, and whan the tyme was, the cordes were cutte\r\n    and the Trumpettis blew up for euery man to do his\r\n    deuoir. And for to assertayne you more of the Tournay\r\n    there was on eche side a stake, and at eache stake two\r\n    Kynges of Armes, with penne, and Inke, and paper, to\r\n    write the names of all of them that were yolden, for\r\n    they shold no more Tournay.”\r\n\r\nThis refers to the _mêlée_, not the joust.\r\n\r\nKing René d’Anjou, in _Traicte de la forme et Devis d’ung Tournoi_,\r\ngives an illustration of a _mêlée_ in which the attendants are seen\r\ncutting the cords with axes, but there are no kings of arms present\r\nnoting the score.\r\n\r\nAnother reference occurs in the account given in the Landsdowne MS.\r\n285 of the combat between the Bastard of Burgundy and Lord Scales in\r\n1466, a contest which has been already described on these pages. It is\r\nentitled _The Ordinaunce of kepyng of the Feelde_, and runs—\r\n\r\n      “... At ev’y corner a Kyng of Armes crownyd and an\r\n    Harauld or Pursevaunte within the seide feelde, for\r\n    reporte makyng of actes doon within the same: Garter\r\n    and othir Kynges of Armes and Hauraldes to be sett in\r\n    the scaffolde before the Kyng on the right hande of the\r\n    staire of the Kynges place judiciall’ to make report\r\n    generall’ and to marke all that should be doon in the\r\n    seide feelde.”\r\n\r\nAnd we may infer that a score of the points, for and against, was kept\r\non the occasion.[234] Hall, in his narrative of the Field of the Cloth\r\nof Gold, states definitely that the scores of the combatants were\r\nmarked down by the proper officials, English and French.\r\n\r\nThe Duc d’Alençon and three French gentlemen, with the earls of Sussex\r\nand Leicester, challenged all comers, in 1551, to fight at barriers,\r\nand they had forty-five opponents.[235]\r\n\r\nJousts were run at Westminster, in conjunction with a great pageant,\r\non January 22nd, 1581, in the presence of Queen Elizabeth. The fêtes\r\nextended over several days, and many lances were broken at the tilting.\r\nThe crowd was so great at the pageant that many citizens were maimed\r\nand some killed. Those taking part in the tilting were Henry Gray,\r\nSir Thomas Perot, Anthony Cooke, Thomas Radcliffe, Robert and Francis\r\nKnolles, Rafe Bowes, Thomas Kelwaie, George Goring, William Tresham,\r\nRobert Alexander, Edward Dennie, Hercules Meantus, Edward Moore,\r\nRichard Skipwith, Richard Ward, Edward Digbie, Henry Nowell and Henry\r\nBrunkerd. During the running Sir Henry Lee entered the tiltyard as The\r\nUnknown and, after breaking six lances, retired again. The challengers\r\neach ran six courses against all comers. A _Scharmützel_, being the\r\nattack and defence of a mock fortress on which cannon were mounted,\r\ntook place later, and this was followed by the tourney and barriers.\r\nTaking part in these were the Earl of Arundel, Lord Windsor, Sir Philip\r\nSidney and Fulke Greville, Esquire.[236]\r\n\r\nA tournament was held on the 15th May following, as mentioned in\r\nAshmole MS. No. 845, fol. 166, a copy of which follows:—\r\n\r\n    “The Tournay holden at Westminster on monday the 15. of May. 1581.\r\n       when as the prince dolphine of Auuergne and other the frenche\r\n       commissioners were here.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: This mark at the end signifyeth that that party hath\r\nperfourmed his blowes at the passage and at the joyninge.”\r\n\r\n(46 more figures like this, with a line at the right end. They are\r\narranged in two columns.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe challengers were Monsieur the brother of the French King, the\r\nPrince Delphine,[237] the earls of Sussex and Leicester, the Count S.\r\nAignon, Messires Chamuallan and Bacqueuile. The venans were led by Lord\r\nThomas Howard.\r\n\r\nAnother tournament took place at Westminster on November 17th in the\r\nsame year, and a list of names of those taking part is given in Ashmole\r\nMS.

Sixteen\r\ncombatants fought on each side, first singly and then in threes.\r\nOne party was led by the Duke of Lennox, the other by the Earl of\r\nSussex.[239]\r\n\r\nAnother fight at barriers took place on Twelfth-night, 1610, when\r\nHenry Prince of Wales, with six aides, met sixty-five defendants at\r\nWhitehall. The weapons were pikes and single swords, and the prince,\r\nthen in his sixteenth year, is stated to have greatly distinguished\r\nhimself.[240]\r\n\r\nHarleian MS., III, 215, 4888, 20, is a general challenge at tilt,\r\ntourney, and barriers, “signed Lenox, Southampton, Pembroke,\r\nMontgumbray,” dated 1612. It was in defence of these propositions—“1.\r\nThat in Service of Ladyes, Knights have no free-will. 2. That it is\r\nBeautie maintains the World in valour. 3. That noe fare Ladie was ever\r\nfalse. 4. That none can be perfectlye wife but Lover.” The challenge\r\nwas addressed, “To all honourable men, Men at Armes, and Knight\r\nAdventurers of hereditarie note, ＆ examplarie noblesse, that for most\r\nmemorable actions doe wield either Sword or Launce in quest of glorie.”\r\n\r\nAshmole MS. No. 837, fol. 129-32, gives a long account of “The manner\r\nof first cominge into the Tiltyard” of Charles Prince of Wales in the\r\nyear 1619. It is interesting from many points of view, and we reproduce\r\nit here nearly _in extenso_. Like all accounts of the tournament of\r\nthe period but little information is given of the martial sports\r\nthemselves, though a great deal is written concerning the dresses,\r\netc. This MS. affords abundant evidence that the last stage of the\r\ntournament had been reached.\r\n\r\n      “The manner of the first cominge into the\r\n    Tiltyard of the Most high and mighty Prince Charles\r\n    Prince of Wales sonne and heir apparent of our\r\n    Souereign Lo: Kinge James on Friday the xxiiijᵗʰ\r\n    of March 1619 wͨͪ was in the most princely and\r\n    Royall manner that had been sene many yeares before.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [fol. 129 b]]\r\n\r\n      The day and tyme drawing neare the Tiltyard at\r\n    Whitehall was prepared wᵗʰ many scaffoldes on both\r\n    sides ＆ the vpper end where stood his Majestie himself\r\n    wᵗʰ many other great estates and on the one side sate\r\n    in a place prepared of purpose at the vpper end the\r\n    Embassadors on the other side next to Sᵗ James parke\r\n    gate was erected a most rich ＆ stately Pauillion of\r\n    green yellow ＆ white damaske laid on wᵗʰ broad lace\r\n    of siluer ＆ gold wᵗʰ a very deep valence of cloth of\r\n    silver frendged about wᵗʰ a deep freng of gold ＆ siluer\r\n    garnished about wᵗʰ The princes Armes ＆ badges. on the\r\n    top of it was set an Eglet in her nest loking vp at\r\n    the sonne wᵗʰ this motto at it Nec Degener heres.

Far too much\r\nstress has been laid on the extended use of firearms as being the main\r\nreason for this, though the ever-increasing penetrative force of the\r\nmusket-ball had tended greatly to diminish the value of steel harness\r\nas a sure means of defence. As a matter of fact, full armour could not\r\nbe constantly worn during a long campaign without injury to health,\r\nbesides being a great clog to mobility on the march and in the field.\r\nAnother potent factor towards the disuse of armour lay in the fact that\r\nharness for the soldiery was made in certain standard or arbitrary\r\nsizes, each piece being numbered, so that the suits rarely fitted\r\nindividual cases. They were thus apt to chafe the bodies of the wearers\r\nand to cause sores beyond endurance, so that pieces of armour were\r\nfrequently cast away on the march, all penalties notwithstanding. The\r\nman-at-arms of an earlier age became the pistolier, _Landsknecht_ and\r\ncuirassier of later times.\r\n\r\nEarly in the seventeenth century another decided change took place in\r\nthe form of the breastplate, which followed the cut of the doublet of\r\ncivil life, in the gradual shortening of the waist, and body-armour\r\nbecame stumpy and inelegant.\r\n\r\nThe latest phase of cap-à-pie armour is well illustrated by a harness\r\nin the Musée d’Artillerie, Paris, which was presented by the Republic\r\nof Venice to Louis XIV, in 1688. It is very uncouth in form. During the\r\nlast half of the century plate-armour gradually disappears, the pikemen\r\nbeing the last infantry arm to employ it. A “pair of plates” were the\r\nlast pieces worn, and, except in the case of the cuirassiers, they also\r\nwere abandoned in favour of the buff coat pure and simple.\r\n\r\nAfter a career of six centuries, the tourney had practically run its\r\ncourse, and had now become almost a thing of the past. Its influence on\r\nthe ages had been in the main for good, in restraining the licence of\r\ntroublous times and in inculcating a respect for women. It had fostered\r\na spirit of courtesy, honour and chivalry, sentiments which extended\r\nthemselves far beyond its borders, Sainte-Palaye remarks, “_Chevalerie\r\nest la fontaine de courtoisie, ce qui arrose le reste du monde_”;\r\nbut as the means for luxury increased, and as time rolled on, the\r\nold simplicity fell away and corruption set in, and though the forms\r\nremained the spirit had fled. All _raisons d’être_ for the tourney\r\nbeyond those of exercise and pastime had long since passed away,\r\nthrough the continuous decline in the importance of the man-at-arms in\r\nwarfare, the ever-increasing efficiency of firearms, and the necessity\r\nfor greater mobility of armies in the field.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe history of the tournament would not be complete without some\r\naccount of the revivals attempted in the nineteenth and twentieth\r\ncenturies. They lack, however, a sense of reality, being, in fact,\r\nmerely more or less well-staged plays.\r\n\r\nThe Eglington Tournament, held in Ayrshire in 1839, though a good deal\r\nbased on Sir Walter Scott’s legend, the “Gentle and Joyous Passage\r\nof Arms of Ashby de la Zouche,”[241] was, in many respects, also a\r\nrevival of a _pas d’armes_ of Tudor times. It was carried through in\r\nthe face of some ridicule, much discouragement and many difficulties;\r\nbut all obstacles were gallantly surmounted by the enthusiasm, tenacity\r\nand liberality of the Earl of Eglingtoun and his coadjutors. The very\r\nelements were against it, for torrents of rain fell frequently during\r\nits course, converting the lists into a pond, spoiling the decorations\r\nof the stands, and wrecking the temporary banqueting-hall erected at\r\nthe castle. The training of the horses in so short a time presented\r\nthe greatest practical difficulty, for here the promoters were at a\r\ngreat disadvantage as against the early and persistent drilling of the\r\nchargers for employment in the _fêtes d’armes_ of the olden times. The\r\nlists at Eglington Park measured 600 yards by 250, the tilt or barrier\r\nbeing 300 yards long, running down the centre. A handsome pavilion was\r\npitched for the use and comfort of the Queen of Beauty (Lady Seymour)\r\nand her train of ladies. There were other tents for the accommodation\r\nof the knights taking part, and a grand stand was erected for the\r\npresiding queen, her maidens, and the guests of the promoters. Seats\r\nwere placed at the eastern end of the arena for about two thousand\r\nspectators. Thirty-five knights took part in this passage of arms, and\r\namong them were Prince Louis Napoleon, the Marquis of Waterford, Earls\r\nEglingtoun, Craven and Cassilis, Lords Alford, Glenyon, Cranstoun, A.\r\nSeymour, W. Beresford, Drumlanrig and Maidstone. Lord Gage and Sir\r\nCharles Lamb acted as Marshals of the List, the rôle of King of Arms\r\nbeing sustained by the Marquis of Londonderry. There were several\r\nrehearsals, the last of which took place on July 13th. The first to\r\njoust at the tilt on that occasion were the Earl of Eglingtoun and the\r\nLord Cranstoun. Several courses were run by these champions and two\r\nlances were broken. Other encounters followed with varying fortune. The\r\n“Lord of the Tournament” was the Earl of Eglingtoun; the Judge of the\r\nLists, Lord Saltoun; and the inevitable Jester, a Mr. M’Ian from London.\r\n\r\nThe procession was arranged by Sir Charles Lamb and Lord Saltoun. The\r\ntournament began on August 28th, 1839. The morning was fine, and by one\r\no’clock some ten thousand persons had assembled, and crowds continued\r\nto arrive. A pitiless rain much delayed the starting of the procession\r\nfrom the castle, and it was sadly shorn of its fair proportions;\r\nfor the Queen of Beauty and her maidens had to betake themselves to\r\ncarriages instead of riding on horseback as intended. The procession\r\nreached the lists in the afternoon, about three, in a much bedraggled\r\ncondition, and the presiding queen, her attendants and the castle\r\nhouse-party, took their seats on the grand stand prepared for them.\r\nAfter flourishes of trumpets, the rules, regulations and limitations\r\nfor the guidance of the proceedings were proclaimed by a herald. The\r\nnumber of courses to be run by each pair of jousters was settled at\r\nthree, or at most four. The harnesses employed, some of them collected\r\nin England, the rest abroad, varied greatly in regard to period: the\r\narmour of the Earl of Craven is amusingly stated to have been worn\r\nby an ancestor of the Earl’s (Baron Hilton) at the field of Cressy.\r\nReinforcing pieces were employed.\r\n\r\nOn the weather clearing a little, the scene presented was a brilliant\r\none. There were the knights armed at all points, and their horses\r\ngaily trapped in cloth painted in rich colours with their arms and\r\ndevices. Merging with the rich dresses of the ladies, they offered\r\na fine and moving spectacle. The _pas d’armes_ commenced with the\r\nquintain, after which jousting at the tilt began. The tilting was far\r\nfrom satisfactory, for the attaints achieved were very few in number.\r\nThis was owing to the lack of skill on the part of the riders, the\r\ninsufficient training of the horses, and the mistaken notion that\r\nthe careers were to be run at the gallop instead of at an amble.\r\nThe first joust was run between the “Knight of the Swan” (the Hon.\r\nMr. Jerningham) and the “Knight of the Golden Lion” (Captain J. O.\r\nFairlie). They took up positions for their careers, and the trumpets\r\nsounded the onset. There were no attaints in the first three courses,\r\nbut in the fourth the Knight of the Golden Lion broke his lance on\r\nthe shield of his adversary. The second challenge was by the Earl of\r\nEglingtoun to the Marquis of Waterford, and in the first course both\r\nlances were splintered. There was no attaint in the second, but in the\r\nthird the Earl again splintered his lance. The third joust was between\r\nSir Francis Hopkins and R. J. Lechmere, Esq. In the first encounter Sir\r\nFrancis shivered his lance, and in the second both lances were broken,\r\nbut that of Sir Francis was disallowed as being “ill-broken.” In the\r\nfourth career Sir Francis again shivered his lance. The fourth tilt\r\nwas between the Lords Glenlyon and Alford. There were no attaints in\r\nthe first two courses, but in the third Lord Alford broke his spear.\r\nNext came combats on foot at barriers with two-handed swords, after\r\nwhich jousting was resumed. The last joust of the day was between the\r\nMarquis of Waterford and Lord Alford. The first course was without\r\nattaint, and in the second a hit was disallowed, the lance breaking\r\njust above the head; but in the third the Marquis shivered his lance\r\n“as it ought to be broken.” During all this the rain fell at intervals\r\nand with increasing violence, which sadly marred the brilliancy of the\r\nscene, and the banquet had to be abandoned owing to the wrecking of\r\nthe temporary banqueting-hall by the storm. In the evening there were\r\ncombats with broadswords in the drawing-room of the castle, and a duel\r\nbetween Prince Louis Napoleon and Mr. Lamb is stated to have afforded\r\nsome excellent sword-play. The tournament was to have been continued\r\non the following Thursday, but the weather was so boisterous that the\r\ncompletion of the _pas d’armes_ was postponed to Friday, August 30th.\r\nThe weather was fine and sunny, and the procession to the lists was\r\nthis time complete in all its parts, the queen and her ladies being on\r\nhorseback. The first tilt of the day was between the Lords Glenlyon\r\nand Alford, and there was but one attaint in the three courses. The\r\nEarl of Craven and Captain Fairlie then took up positions for their\r\ncareers. Both lances were shivered in the first course, in the second\r\nthere was no attaint, but in the third the Earl again shivered his\r\nlance. This was the best joust of the tournament. To be brief, there\r\nwere six more jousts, making altogether nineteen courses, and but\r\ntwo attaints. Running at the Ring followed, and a _mêlée_ brought the\r\ntournament to a close. The combatants in the latter were—The Lord of\r\nthe Tournament (Earl of Eglingtoun), the Knight of the Dragon (Marquis\r\nof Waterford), the Black Knight (W. L. Gilmour, Esq.), and the Knight\r\nof the Gael (Lord Glenlyon): _against_ the Knight of the Black Lion\r\n(Viscount Alford), the Knight of the Red Rose (R. J. Lechmere, Esq.),\r\nthe Knight of the White Rose (Charles Lamb, Esq.), and the Knight of\r\nthe Swan (Hon. H. Jerningham). Mr. Jerningham was hurt in the wrist by\r\na sword-stroke in the _mêlée_, but this was the only casualty worth\r\nrecording during the tournament. Several of the knights were unseated,\r\nand in one case both horse and rider fell, a few bruises resulting.\r\nThe prize was awarded to the Earl of Eglingtoun. It was a coronet,\r\nwith which the Queen of Beauty gracefully crowned him, in the manner\r\nof the Lady Rowena in the lists at Ashby de la Zouche. There was a\r\nbanquet in the evening, at which Lord Eglingtoun expressed the hope\r\nthat this attempt at a revival of the tournament might result in its\r\nbeing continued among the nobility and gentry of these islands. This\r\npious wish, however, failed to be realised, the very ethics of the\r\ninstitution being so totally at variance with the sentiment prevailing\r\nin modern times. The banquet was followed by a dance.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TOURNAMENT AT BRUSSELS IN 1905\r\n\r\nIn marked contrast to the Eglingtoun Tournament, in the way of\r\naccuracy of detail and historic truth, was the _pas d’armes_ in the\r\nRathausplatz, at Brussels, in 1905, held nearly three-quarters of a\r\ncentury later. This revival in what was once Burgundian territory was\r\nmost appropriate, the more so as it took place in Brussels itself.\r\nIt was in the Rathausplatz there, one of the most striking sites in\r\nEurope, that the Comte de Charolais, afterwards Charles the Bold,\r\nran in his first tournament in 1452. The Comte was then but eighteen\r\nyears of age, and tilted in as many courses on that occasion, breaking\r\nsixteen lances “as they ought to be broken”—a very good performance,\r\nviz. sixteen attaints out of eighteen runs. It was this tournament,\r\nheld in the city of Brussels some four and a half centuries before, in\r\nthe reign of Philippe le Bon, that was selected for reconstruction in\r\nthe months of July and August, 1905.[242] Charles was born in November,\r\n1433, and the tournament in question was held in commemoration of the\r\nanniversary of his birthday. He was killed in battle on the fatal field\r\nof Nancy in 1477. In the month of August of the same year his daughter\r\nand heiress, the Princess Maria, was wedded to Maximilian of Austria,\r\nand the brilliant traditions of the tournament passed over to his court.\r\n\r\nThe collection of illuminated MSS. in the Burgundian Library, now\r\ntransferred to the National Library at Brussels, with the _Armorial\r\nde la Toison d’Or_ and other Burgundian records, now in the National\r\nLibrary at Paris,[243] furnish reliable and inexhaustible material\r\nfor the correct staging of a modern revival of a tournament on the\r\nlines of one of the fifteenth century. It is thus no wonder that the\r\nreconstruction, in the summer of 1905, of the _pas d’armes_ of 1452\r\nwas attended by such success as to prove of great educational value.\r\nThe middle of the fifteenth century was, perhaps, the most picturesque\r\nperiod of the tourney: its rich weapons and armour, the caparisons\r\nof the horses, the arms of the champions and others, the lists, the\r\nmusic, and even the very musical instruments of the period, together\r\nwith the sumptuous accessories of the brilliant Burgundian Court, were\r\nreproduced in 1905 to a marvel.\r\n\r\nThe reconstruction, as presented at Brussels, began with the entry of\r\nDuke Philip of Burgundy into the lists in the Rathausplatz, with a\r\nsplendid train of the ladies of his court, the Marshal of the Lists,\r\nthe King of Arms (Jean Lefébre de Saint-Remy, the reputed writer of the\r\n_Armorial de la Toison d’Or_), the Comte de Charolais, with his five\r\njousting associates and many historic figures of the camp and tourney\r\nthroughout Christendom, the four judges of the tournament, heralds,\r\npursuivants, etc. The Duke having taken his seat as supreme umpire on\r\nthe gaily decked tribune prepared for him, the trumpets sounded and the\r\njousting began. Many courses were run in character. This was followed\r\nby the quintain, and afterwards by combats on foot and a _mêlée_;\r\nthen the prizes were presented. Figures of the knights of 1452, such\r\nas those of the Comte de Charolais, Jacques de Lalain and Fredrich\r\nde Renesse, were faithfully reproduced in all their details. Some\r\nexcellent post-cards were published in Belgium, picturing some of the\r\nprincipal scenes of the tournament. Plate XII (1) depicts the Comte de\r\nCharolais armed at all points for the _mêlée_, and Plate XII (2) Jean\r\nde Clèves. The _fêtes d’armes_ and its rehearsals extended over several\r\nweeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n“TRIUMPH” HELD AT EARL’S COURT, LONDON, ON JULY 11TH, 1912\r\n\r\nThe object of the promoters of this revival was to reproduce an\r\nElizabethan tournament of about the year 1580, such an one as is\r\ndescribed in this chapter. This idea was very creditably carried out,\r\nthough falling short of the Brussels reproduction of 1905 in the\r\nmatters of technique and minuteness and correctness of detail. It\r\nmust be remembered, however, that in 1580 the tournament, then itself\r\na revival in England, had reached an advanced stage of decadence,\r\nand that the materials available for reconstruction are scanty and\r\nuncertain, as contrasted with the ample records of the century\r\npreceding. The Earl’s Court reproduction is stated to have been devised\r\nby Mrs. George Cornwallis-West and Mr. Seymour Lucas, R.A., with the\r\ntechnical assistance of Mr. (now Sir) Guy Laking. The stage management\r\nof the play was in the competent hands of Mr. (now Sir) Frank R.\r\nBenson. It is interesting to see so many historic names and titles,\r\ncorresponding with those of Tudor times, borne by the jousters at\r\nEarl’s Court. The rôle of Marshal of the Lists was sustained by Lord\r\nLonsdale, and the judges were Lords Shrewsbury and Talbot, Essex, and\r\nDudley, with Major-General Brocklehurst. The Queen of Beauty was the\r\nViscountess Curzon.\r\n\r\nThe procession to the arena was headed by trumpeters and four\r\npursuivants, marching on foot; then rode the marshal, armed at all\r\npoints, with the herald (Sir F. R. Benson). The four judges, clad in\r\nblack robes, followed, their esquire (Sir Guy Laking) bearing the\r\numpire’s bâton. After their entry into the lists the trumpets again\r\nsounded and the Queen of Beauty, with her train of maidens, all mounted\r\non palfreys, gaily decorated with roses, each led by a henchman, rode\r\ninto the arena. The Queen was attended by an esquire, and her palfrey\r\nwas caparisoned in silk. She was clad in a ruff, a robe sparkling with\r\ndiamonds, and a long mantle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE XII_\r\n\r\nTHE COMTE DE CHAROLAIS, AS REPRESENTED AT BRUSSELS IN 1905]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JEAN DE CLÈVES, AS REPRESENTED AT BRUSSELS IN 1905]\r\n\r\nThe knights were arranged in trios, each cavalier preceded by an\r\nesquire, bearing his lance, and followed by other esquires. The\r\nfirst champion was the Duke of Marlborough; his motto was _Fiel pero\r\ndesdichado_, his colours a dark blue, and his proof armour was etched\r\nwith gold. The second was Lord Craven; his motto was _Virtus in actione\r\nconsistet_, his colours green, and he wore the famous armour made for\r\nPhilip II of Spain. Lord Compton completed the first trio, and his\r\nmotto was _Je ne cherche qu’un_. The second trio followed, and all did\r\nhomage to the Queen of Beauty, now seated on her throne. The herald\r\nthen proclaimed that the six knights would joust at the tilt, for a\r\nrich and noble prize. The Lord Chrichton and the Duke of Marlborough\r\nwere the first to joust, and five courses were run by each pair. On\r\ncompletion the verdict of the Queen of Beauty was that the Duke had\r\nwell jousted, but that Lord Ashby St. Ledgers, whose motto was _Ferro\r\nnon gladio_, had jousted best, and he received the prize, viz. a gold\r\ncup of the value of £600, from her hands. The tilt was then removed and\r\na _mêlée_ followed, in which twelve knights were engaged. There was, of\r\ncourse, a banquet in the evening followed by a dance.\r\n\r\nThere was also a revival at Rome.\r\n\r\nThere now only remains the judicial duel to be described, an\r\ninstitution which had much affinity with the tournament, and which,\r\nindeed, formed an integral part of it, both in sentiment and fact. This\r\nimportant branch of the subject is dealt with at some length in the\r\nnext chapter.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[191] Chapter X, 1.\r\n\r\n[192] Chapter XIII.\r\n\r\n[193] Without a tilt.\r\n\r\n[194] The term “tourney” is very frequently employed by chroniclers to\r\nexpress the mêlée, though also often applied in a general sense.\r\n\r\n[195] _Waffenkunde_, Fig. 631.\r\n\r\n[196] Monstrelet, _Continuation_, Chap.

This law,\r\nthough falling greatly into disuse after the reign of Queen Elizabeth,\r\nremained on the statute book until early in the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nAmong the Ashmolean, Harleian and Cottonian MSS. are many tracts,\r\ntreatises and other documents relating to the laws and manner of\r\nconducting judicial duels, with other matter concerning these combats;\r\nand abstracts from the MSS. are given in Appendices E, F, and G,\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\nThe custom of trial by combat or legal duel, the ordeal of battle,\r\nwas introduced into England by the Normans.[244] As far as can be\r\nascertained it was unknown to the Anglo-Saxons, though the ordeal of\r\nhot water appears in one of Ine’s laws;[245] and, indeed, trial by\r\nordeal appears repeatedly among the laws of the Anglo-Saxon kings. The\r\nprinciple involved was the same in both cases, viz. that the Almighty\r\nwould not remain indifferent when solemnly invoked, but would intervene\r\nmiraculously so that the ends of justice might be furthered. The\r\nsimple faith of the times would act as a deterrent to appeals to the\r\njudgment of God and would thus tend to limit the number of cases. The\r\nconsciousness of innocence or guilt would also contribute towards the\r\nvindication of the cause of justice in actual combat.\r\n\r\nThe proofs by fire and water (_vulgaris purgatio_), holding, carrying\r\nor walking over hot iron or heated plough-shares (_ferri candentis\r\njudicium_), being thrown into deep water, bound hand and foot, may be\r\nsaid roughly to have preceded that by judicial combat; but they form\r\nquite another and earlier branch of the subject. The number of cases\r\ngiven in history of these earlier forms of ordeal which defendants are\r\nstated to have passed through triumphantly is considerable, but most of\r\nthem must surely be either apocryphal, or the intensity of the ordeals\r\nthemselves was much exaggerated.\r\n\r\nOrdeal by combat is found among the laws of nearly all the German\r\ntribes; and it flourished greatly in France until cases of more than\r\nsuspected miscarriage of justice brought it into disrepute. An edict\r\npassed at Lyons in the year 501 established the institution as a\r\nregular form of trial. It appears among the ancient laws of the Swedes\r\nand Lombards.\r\n\r\nIn civil cases a claimant would declare that some ancestor of his had\r\nbeen in seisin of certain property but had been unlawfully deprived of\r\nit by another, and he would offer battle to the “tenant,” as the owner\r\nwas then called, for its restitution, by the body of a champion. The\r\ntenant, or defendant, could then choose between an appeal to the Grand\r\nAssize, an inquest where the question of right is determined by the\r\nverdict of neighbours,[246] in which institution may be traced the germ\r\nof the more modern jury; or to the ordeal of battle, in his own body\r\nor by champion. No one was compelled to defend his seisin of a free\r\ntenement by battle, though a claimant could offer combat in the lists,\r\nwhich, however, might be refused by a defendant. When a civil court\r\nordered a combat it was fought on foot in a small circular or oblong\r\nenclosure, similar to that used in the foot-fighting, with shields\r\nand staves (bastons) at a _pas d’armes_ of the fifteenth century.\r\nThe course of procedure in criminal cases for the most part differed\r\nwidely from that followed in civil cases and was under quite another\r\njurisdiction; and it largely consisted of accusations made against the\r\nhonour of certain persons, or of alleged treason. It was customary\r\nfor an accuser to justify his charge by an offer of single combat in\r\nthe lists, “God showing the right”; and such a mode of settlement was\r\ngreatly in unison with the chivalric spirit of the age. To bring such\r\na matter to an issue an accuser offered battle by throwing down his\r\nglove, which when lifted by a defendant signified that the challenge\r\nwas accepted. The king was appealed to, and, in the event of the case\r\nbeing remitted to the ordeal of battle, he assigned the place and day\r\nfor the combat. He further, in consultation with the constable and\r\nmarshal, decided on the preliminaries, the conditions of battle to be\r\nobserved being regulated in accordance with fixed ordinances, which in\r\nEngland were drawn up by the constable for the time being. The combat\r\nwould be on horseback, fighting _à outrance_, with lance and sword, in\r\nlists similar to those erected for the tourney. Charges of homicide\r\nor murder might in this country be remitted to the ordeal of battle,\r\nwith shields and bastons and in civil garments. Should an accused or\r\nclaimant fail to appear in the lists on the day appointed he could be\r\noutlawed.\r\n\r\nThe judicial duel may be regarded as the prototype or parent of the\r\nchivalrous duel on foot at a _pas d’armes_.\r\n\r\nThe custom never took deep root in England, though during the reign\r\nof King Henry II, when the monarchy had become more settled, and in\r\nthe times of his immediate successors Richard and John, disputes\r\nrelating to the possession of land were very rife, greatly owing to\r\nthe fact that so many manors and smaller holdings had been forcibly\r\nand illegally riven from their rightful owners in the preceding reigns\r\nsince the Conquest, by the barons and their adherents. The ordinary\r\nlaw courts experienced great difficulty in dealing with them on the\r\nprinciples set forth in the written statutes, which then as always\r\ninclined to favour the man in possession; and the rough and ready\r\nsettlement by combat was ordered, more especially in cases where there\r\nwas a hopeless conflict of testimony between litigants and no means of\r\ngetting at the truth by the evidence of any living witnesses.\r\n\r\nThe actual number of judicial duels would seem to have been small in\r\nEngland, for in the great majority of cases before the courts the\r\njudges managed to declare that there should be no combat.\r\n\r\nCertain persons were excused from battle. They comprised the citizens\r\nof London, who were exempted by charter; the clergy; “_sexagenarii_”;\r\nand “those blind by accident after issue joined.”[247] Women were not\r\nexempted by law and, indeed, sometimes fought.\r\n\r\nThe early ordinances, forms and manner of carrying out this\r\nsingular institution in practice in England are given in _Origines\r\nJuridiciales_.[248]\r\n\r\nA short and imperfect summary follows on these pages:\r\n\r\n\r\nTRIAL BY COMBAT IN CIVIL CASES\r\n\r\nIn cases where this mode of trial for the possession of certain lands\r\nor other property was allowed by the court, and a combat followed, the\r\nfurther tenure of a holding in question would depend solely on the\r\nprinciple of battle, without any later appeal to the Grand Assize being\r\npermissible.\r\n\r\nBefore a trial by combat could be sanctioned the claimant in the suit\r\nwas summoned before the court with his champion, who, once fixed upon,\r\ncould not be changed, unless in the case of his “natural death” taking\r\nplace in the interval before battle; but should he die “by his own\r\nfault, the lord shall lose his Sute.”\r\n\r\nThe defendant might either defend his cause in person or fight by\r\ndeputy; but should he elect to be represented by champion and the one\r\nchosen should die in the interim it would become a question to be\r\nargued before the court as to whether or not the defendant should be\r\nallowed to appoint another in his place. The challenger or demandant\r\nwas not allowed to fight in person.\r\n\r\nShould the defendant, the “tenant,” be vanquished in the fight, then\r\n“the lord shall lose the land and the claimant shall have it”; but it\r\noften happened that a champion had been hired for some fee or reward,\r\nand if this should be proved the principal would lose his suit. Some\r\nparticulars are given of a case of this kind[249] “betwixt Thomas\r\nfitz Hugh de Staunton and the prior of Lenton for the advousen of\r\nthe church of Harlaston, in Northamptonshire.” Both parties to the\r\nsuit were represented by champion, the appellant being a churchman,\r\nand they fought on foot in the lists, armed with bastons (i.e.\r\npolygonally-shaped maces or cudgels of heavy wood, tipped with horn:\r\n“basculi cornuti, bastons cornuz”).[250]\r\n\r\n\r\nTRIAL BY COMBAT IN CASES CRIMINAL\r\n\r\nThis was conducted much on the lines of knightly usage in combats\r\non horseback _à outrance_, except, as already stated, in charges of\r\nhomicide or murder.\r\n\r\nThe cartel setting forth the charge, subscribed to on oath, was laid\r\nbefore the judges of chivalry by the appellant, the accuser, stating\r\nthat “he was ready to maintain the same with his body.” This document\r\nwas then considered by the judges, and should combat be allowed it was\r\nserved on the accused, the defendant; and if within an interval of six\r\nweeks he had not responded, judgment was registered against him by\r\ndefault, his coat-armour being reversed or ignominiously fastened under\r\nhis horse’s tail, in disgrace.\r\n\r\nShould the accused stand on his defence both parties were cited to\r\nappear in the field outside the lists, which were quadrangular in form\r\nwith a gate at each end. Judgment seats were provided for the constable\r\nand marshal, and at their feet were stationed a competent number of\r\nexperienced knights and “a doctor or two of civil laws,” all for the\r\nadvice and assistance of the court.\r\n\r\nThe appellant first came to the gate at the right end of the lists,\r\nclad in complete armour, attended by his esquires, and the constable\r\nand marshal demanded of him through their herald his name and purpose.\r\nOn his answering, he was conducted into the lists by a knight and\r\nherald and placed before the judgment seat on the right hand. A similar\r\ncourse of procedure was adopted towards the defendant, who was placed\r\nfacing the accuser on the left hand.\r\n\r\nThe choice of the weapons stipulated in the cartel lay with the\r\ndefendant, and the advisory knights inspected and measured them for\r\nboth sides, so that there might be no inequality in that respect\r\nbetween the parties; and the knights must answer for it that there be\r\nno enchantment or magic practised on either side.\r\n\r\nIt was then demanded of the principals if their purpose held, and they\r\naffirmed the same, laying their hands on the Evangelists. The appellant\r\nthen briefly rehearsed the terms of the cartel of defiance, making oath\r\nas to its truth, after which the defendant affirmed also on oath his\r\ndenial of the charge.\r\n\r\nThese preliminaries over the parties prepared for battle, which was\r\nto continue from sunrise to sunset; the herald crys, “Let them goe\r\ntogether,” and the onset is sounded by trumpet call.\r\n\r\nShould the appellant not overcome the defendant during the day the\r\nlatter was deemed guiltless, and the procurator of the constable and\r\nmarshal publicly proclaimed the fact: but to secure what was termed\r\n“a perfect victory,” a confession of guilt by one of the parties was\r\nnecessary. The cartel was then sealed with the common seal in testimony\r\nthat the combat had duly taken place, and all the legal formalities\r\nbeen observed.\r\n\r\nA picture of a legal duel on a murder charge, of the reign of Henry\r\nIII, has been preserved, and the names of the combatants are written\r\nupon it. It has been reproduced by Hewitt in _Ancient Armour and\r\nWeapons of War_,[251] and the parties are represented fighting. A\r\ngallows is depicted in the group with the vanquished combatant hanging\r\nfrom it. This was no knightly battle—the champions fought on foot in\r\ntheir civil dresses of leather or cloth, bare-headed, with quadrangular\r\nbowed shields, and bastons garnished at their heads with spurs, like\r\nthose of a pick.\r\n\r\nRules and ordinances for the regulation of judicial combats in France\r\nwere promulgated by Phillip IV, surnamed le Bel. An abridged account of\r\nthem follows:—[252]\r\n\r\nFour things to be established before the Gage of Battle may be adjudged.\r\n\r\n    1. The institution applies to grave suspicion in cases\r\n       of murder, manslaughter, treason or the like offences.\r\n    2. Every true man if he knows himself to be accused to\r\n       present himself before the court without waiting to\r\n       be cited or summoned.\r\n    3. That no gage be granted for accusations of theft or robbery.\r\n    4. On a gage of battle being granted the appellant\r\n       to furnish particulars as to where the alleged\r\n       wicked deed was done, the name of the party dead; or full\r\n       details of the treason alleged to have been committed.\r\n\r\nShould the judge allow the combat the advocate of the appellant is to\r\nlay the case before the court in sober terms; but should the defendant\r\ndeny the charge the appellant must say that, although he cannot prove\r\nit by witnesses or other evidence, yet he can avouch it in his own body\r\nor by another for him, in an enclosed field in presence of the king.\r\n\r\nThe appellant is to throw down his glove and retain counsel for arms,\r\nhorse, etc., necessary for the gage of battle. The defendant may reply\r\nto the accusation that the appellant has falsely and maliciously lied;\r\nand that in his defence, by the help of God and our Lady, he will\r\navouch his innocence with his body or by some other for him; and that\r\nhe will be ready on the day and at the place fixed upon for the combat.\r\nThen he is to take up the gage thrown down by the appellant, and a\r\ndecision will be given by the count as to whether trial by battle will\r\nbe allowed or not.\r\n\r\nIf recourse to a duel be permitted the parties will swear to be on the\r\nground on the day appointed; the combat to be overlooked by wise and\r\nhonest men, clerks, knights, and esquires, without favour to either\r\nparty; but should either appellant or defendant fail to keep his tryst\r\nhe shall be proclaimed recreant, and afterwards arrested.\r\n\r\nRegulations as to the procedure for the combat follows:—the parties to\r\nbring sustenance for themselves and their horses for the day; the lists\r\nto be 40 paces in width by 80 in length, and within them two pavilions\r\nare to be pitched for the use and comfort of the combatants. The herald\r\nis to come on horseback to the gate and to cry three times; firstly,\r\nbefore the arrival of the appellant; secondly, when the combatants have\r\nentered the lists; and thirdly, when they have taken their oaths. The\r\nappellant should be first in the field on the day of battle, before the\r\nhour of noon; the defendant not later than four in the afternoon. The\r\nparties make their affirmations and the sign of the cross, and appear\r\nbefore the stand on which the judge is seated, and he commands them to\r\nraise the visors of their helmets, after which they return to their\r\npavilions. The herald, after having called them for the third time,\r\nmotions them to kneel before a table on which a crucifix and missal\r\nare placed, when a priest admonishes them; and the marshal takes off\r\ntheir right-hand gauntlets and hangs them on the arms of the cross. The\r\ncombatants then mount their horses, the pavilions are removed from the\r\nlists, and the marshal cries, “Gentlemen doe your Deuoire,” throwing\r\ndown his glove, and the combat begins.\r\n\r\nThe body of the vanquished, dead or alive, shall be delivered by the\r\njudge to the marshal, his points cut and armour cast piecemeal in the\r\nlists, and his horse and armour shall appertain to the constable and\r\nmarshal of the field. The victor shall depart honourably from the\r\nlists, on horseback.\r\n\r\nAshmole MS., No. 764, p. 7, furnishes the following:—“_De la droite\r\nordonnance du Gaige de Bataille par tout le royaume de France Philipe\r\npar la grace de Dieu Roy de France a touz ceulx qui ces presentes\r\nlettres verront salut._” This letter of King Philip IV, written in\r\n1306, limits the practice of wager of battle, and is prefixed to\r\nregulations for the whole course of the combat (44-54 b).\r\n\r\nIn Favine’s _Theatre of Honour and Knighthood_,[253] rendered into\r\nEnglish in 1622, judicial duels are thus defined:—“It was the custome\r\nof our auncient French to vndertake the hazard of armes and combat, to\r\njustifie themselues in an Accusation, fordged against their honour and\r\ngood fame; and to sustaine the truth of some iust cause, whereof the\r\nproofes were doubtfull, yea, wholly hid and concealed.” In France the\r\noaths were administered over the bones and relics of saints and martyrs.\r\n\r\nIn _La Vie de Bertrand Du Guesclin_[254] is an account of a singular\r\nlegal duel between Jews, named Daniot and Turquant, which took place in\r\nSpain; and the narration aptly illustrates the superstitious character\r\nof the times and country. These Jews were accused of assassinating\r\nBlanche de Bourbon at night in her bed; and on being charged with\r\nthe crime Daniot averred that he had not entered the bed-chamber of\r\nthe princess at all, and had done his best to prevent Turquant from\r\ncommitting the murder. This Turquant denied on oath, stating that his\r\naccomplice had taken an equal part with himself in causing the death\r\nof the princess. On hearing of this direct conflict of testimony\r\nBertrand Du Guesclin is stated to have suggested a judicial duel in\r\nthe lists (_champ-clos_) between the parties, and this having been\r\nassented to the fight duly took place. The combatants, who were well\r\nmounted and in complete armour, fought with swords, and after some\r\nsevere passages Turquant wounded Daniot in the arm so severely that he\r\nwas incapacitated from further combat, owing mainly to the loss of so\r\nmuch blood. The _coup de mort_ was about to be given to the vanquished\r\nchampion and a confession of his guilt demanded when just at that\r\nmoment a thick cloud appeared above the heads of the combatants, and\r\nissuing from it a flash of lightning struck them both dead.\r\n\r\nAmong the Monstrelet illustrations is a picture of a highly improbable\r\njudicial duel between a man and a dog, the man being accused of\r\nmurdering the dog’s master. The picture was copied from an ancient\r\npainting which hung in the great hall of the Castle of Montargis, and\r\nis supposed to picture an event recorded by Colombière in _Theatre\r\nd’Honneur et de Chevalerie_. The fight is stated to have taken place\r\nin the reign of Charles V of France (1364-1380).[255] The scene\r\nrepresents the duel in progress within a large circular enclosure or\r\nlists, around which are galleries and promenades like a theatre, the\r\nnumerous spectators being richly dressed nobles and ladies. Companies\r\nof soldiers are on guard and there is a large band of trumpeters. The\r\ndefendant is clad in a leather jerkin, torn in places, and slashed\r\ndrawers; he is armed with a baston or club and a large circular shield.\r\nThe dog, a large staghound, is seen gripping the murderer by the\r\nthroat, and justice is vindicated.\r\n\r\n“On the seuenth of June 1380 a combat was fought afore the kings\r\npalace at Westminster, on the pauement there, betwixt one sir John\r\nAnneslie knight, and one Thomas Katrington esquire; the occasion of\r\nwhich strange and notable triall rose hereof. The knight accused the\r\nesquire of treason, for that which the fortresse of saint Sauior within\r\nthe Ile of Constantine in Normandie, belonging sometime to sir John\r\nChandois, had béene committed to the said Katrington, as capteine\r\nthereof, to keepe it against the enemies, he had for monie sold and\r\ndeliuered it ouer to the Frenchmen, when he was suffientlie prouided\r\nwith men, munition and vittels, to have defended it against them: and\r\nsith the inheritance of that fortresse and landes belonging thereto,\r\nhad apperteined to the said Annerslie in right of his wife, as néerest\r\ncousine by affiniti vnto sir John Chandois, if by the false conueiance\r\nof the said Katrington, it had not beene made awaie, and alienated\r\ninto the enemies hands: he offered therefore to trie the quarrell by\r\ncombat, against the said Katrington, wherevpon was the same Katrington\r\napprehended, and put in prison, but shortlie after set at libertie\r\nagaine.” It was decided to try the case by combat, and the constable\r\nand marshal were duly notified. Lists were erected and crowds assembled\r\non the day appointed to witness the fight. On being called three times\r\nby the herald-at-arms the parties entered the lists for fighting, and\r\nthe articles of combat were publicly read, and after each had been duly\r\nsworn the fight commenced “first with speares, after with swords, and\r\nlastlie with daggers. They fought long till finallie the knight had\r\nbereft the esquire of all his weapons, and at length the esquire was\r\nmanfull overthrowned by the knight,” who was declared the conqueror.\r\nThe esquire died soon after from his hurts. The king was present at the\r\nfight.[256]\r\n\r\nMr. Hewitt[257] describes a legal duel of the reign of King Richard\r\nII, between a chevalier of Navarre and an English esquire, which is\r\nfigured in Cotton MS., Nero, D VI. The engraving has been reproduced\r\nin Strutt’s _Regal Antiquities_.[258] Holinshed gives an account of\r\nthe duel, as taking place in 1384, between John Walsh or Wallis and an\r\nesquire of Navarre named Martilet; the charge being that the former\r\nhad forced the wife of the latter. Martilet was slain, his body drawn,\r\nhanged and beheaded.\r\n\r\nFroissart describes a judicial duel which took place at Paris in the\r\nyear 1386, in the reign of Charles VI of France, between the Chevaliers\r\nJean de Carouge and Jacques le Gris, both knights of the household\r\nof the Comte d’Alençon. Owing to the singular nature of the charge\r\nthe event caused a great stir at the time and drew a multitude of\r\nspectators from far and near. De Carouge leaving France to take part\r\nin the crusade in Palestine, his young and handsome wife, a modest and\r\nvirtuous dame, awaited his return in their strong castle of Argenteil.\r\nJacques le Gris having conceived an unlawful passion for the lady\r\ndetermined to gratify it during the absence of her lord. He paid a\r\nvisit to the castle one morning and was received by the lady with all\r\nhonour as being a companion at arms of her husband; and was being shown\r\nover it when he asked to see the dungeon. She suspecting no evil, took\r\nhim down to it alone, when he suddenly locked the door, took advantage\r\nof her and forced her. On the return of de Carouge from the Holy Land\r\nhis wife complained to him of the outrage, which was solemnly denied by\r\nthe defendant; and the husband called together his friends and kindred\r\nto advise with them as to his proper course of action. Parliament was\r\napplied to, and a combat to the death between the parties was arranged\r\nto take place, de Carouge to act as champion for his wife, le Gris\r\nto defend his honour in his own person. Lists were erected at Paris\r\nbehind the Temple, together with accommodation for the vast number of\r\nspectators expected to be present. King Charles was at Sluys at the\r\ntime superintending the arrangements for a contemplated invasion of\r\nEngland, but he hurried back to Paris to sit as umpire on the occasion.\r\nOn the day of battle the two knights entered the lists, with their\r\nsponsors, armed at all points; and the onset was sounded for a joust\r\n_à outrance_, which was run without hurt to either party. They then\r\ndismounted and attacked each other with swords. De Carouge was first\r\nwounded in the thigh, but continued fighting and at length passed his\r\nsword through the body of his adversary, killing him instantly. The\r\nbody of le Gris was delivered over to the common hangman by the marshal\r\nand dragged to Montfauçon, where it was gibbeted.\r\n\r\nJuvenal des Ursins, in _Histoire de Charles VI_,[259] also gives an\r\naccount of this duel, which differs materially from that of Froissart,\r\nand is more likely to be correct. It states that when the vanquished\r\nknight lay wounded on the ground and when de Carouge was about to\r\nadminister the _coup de grâce_ he demanded a confession of guilt, but\r\nle Gris with his last breath solemnly asseverated his denial of the\r\ncrime; and innocent he was later proved to be, for some time afterwards\r\nanother person on his death-bed confessed to having committed the\r\noutrage. The motive of the lady in charging the wrong person is not\r\napparent. The duel is also described in _Les Annales de France_.\r\n\r\nIn 1398 the Dukes of Hereford and Norfolk accused each other of\r\ntreason, and a duel took place between them, though King Richard had in\r\nvain tried to reconcile them. Holinshed gives the following account of\r\nthis combat:—“The duke of Aumarle was that daie high constable and the\r\nduke of Surrie marshal, and they entered vnto the lists with a great\r\ncompanie of men apparelled in silke sendall, imbrodered with siluer\r\nboth richlie and curouslie, euerie man hauing a tipped staffe to keepe\r\nthe feeld in order. About the houre of prime came to the barriers of\r\nthe listes, the duke of Hereford, mounted on a white courser, barded\r\nwith gréene and blew veluet imbrodered sumptuouslie with swans and\r\nantelops of goldsmiths worke, armed at all points. The constable and\r\nmarshall came to the barrier, demanding of him what he was, he answered\r\n‘I am Henrie of Lancaster, duke of Hereford which am come hither to\r\ndoo endeuer against Thomas Mowbraie duke of Norfolke, as a traitor\r\nvnto God, the king, his realme, and me.’ Then he entered the listes,\r\nand descended from his horse, and set him down in a chaire of greene\r\nveluet, at the one end of the lists, and there reposed himself, abiding\r\nthe comming of his aduesarie.” King Richard then entered the lists with\r\ngreat pomp “accompanied with all the péeres of the realm,” and took\r\nhis seat upon the tribune. “After him entered the Duke of Norfolk,\r\nhis horse barded in crimcon velvet, embroidered with lions in silver\r\nand mulberry trees,” and he took his seat in a chair, “which was of\r\ncrimosen veluet, courtined about with white and red damaske.” The\r\nherald then gave the signal for the combat to begin, but the course\r\nproved abortive, and the king cast his bâton, the heralds crying “Ho,\r\nHo.” A council was then held by the king resulting in both dukes being\r\nbanished the realm.[260]\r\n\r\n\r\nTRIAL BY COMBAT IN GERMANY[261]\r\n\r\nApplication had to be made by an appellant to the civic authority of a\r\ntown before a judicial duel could take place, and this having been done\r\nthe following answer would be given:—\r\n\r\n“We have received your letter and are very sorry to see that your\r\nhearts are so moved with rancour and hatred as you seem to bear to\r\none another. In which regard we pray you that you would desist from\r\ncombat if it may be; and that you would end your quarrels by the way of\r\nmildness and gentleness without the adventuring of handy strokes and\r\nwithout shedding human blood. Consent to our request, and so much the\r\nrather because we entreat you most instantly.”\r\n\r\nShould the demand for a trial by combat be still persisted in the\r\nfollowing answer was returned:—\r\n\r\n“Seeing that you still persist in your hatred and challenge, and that\r\nthe way of gentleness can take no course of kindness between you, we\r\ndo order and appoint that you shall appear on such a day before us to\r\nhear the ground and subject of your quarrel, wherein we mean to do you\r\njustice.”\r\n\r\nA day may then be assigned for the combat if it be allowed.\r\n\r\nThe preliminaries and regulations are similar to those which prevailed\r\nin France and England, with, however, the difference that in each\r\nof the pavilions pitched in the lists for the accommodation of the\r\ncombatants, a bier, a coffin, four candles and a shroud for the dead\r\nwere placed; and both the appellant and defendant were confessed by a\r\npriest. If not slain the party vanquished remained infamous for the\r\nrest of his life; he was never allowed participation in aught knightly,\r\nand his beard was to be kept close-shaven.[262]\r\n\r\nTrials by combat in Germany were more complex and far-reaching than was\r\nthe case in France and England, and the weapons employed in conducting\r\nthem more varied and specialized in character.\r\n\r\nA paper was read on February 20th, 1840, before the Society of\r\nAntiquaries, London, by Mr. R. L. Pearsall,[263] entitled, “Some\r\nObservations on Judicial Duels, as practised in Germany”; a short\r\nrésumé of which follows here. The paper is largely based upon a\r\ncurious manuscript of the year 1400, in the Royal Library at Munich,\r\ncontaining some text and a number of wood-cuts on vellum, representing\r\nvarious forms of duel in Germany. The work is by Paulus Kall “Master of\r\nDefence”[264] to the then Duke of Bavaria; and the illustrations refer\r\nto judicial and perhaps other duels as practised in the Fatherland\r\nabout the end of the fourteenth century, as well as to some others of\r\na still earlier period. This MS., together with others at Munich and\r\nGotha, references to which Mr. Pearsall has omitted to give, form the\r\nground-work of his paper.\r\n\r\nStrange though it may seem, the legal duel was resorted to as a court\r\nof appeal in extreme cases of quarrels and accusations between man\r\nand wife; and Fig. 2 in Paulus Kall’s book affords an illustration of\r\nthe manner in which such combats were conducted. It depicts a man,\r\nbare-headed, buried in a pit up to his loins, holding a short staff\r\nin his right hand, the left arm bound to his side. The woman is clad\r\nin her chemise only, which is bound together below the middle by a\r\nlace passing between the legs; the right sleeve of the garment extends\r\nbeyond the hand “_ein dunne Elle_” in a bag which contains a stone,\r\nand this constitutes her weapon of attack. At first sight the combat\r\nwould appear to be an unequal one. It might be thought for a moment\r\nthat the wood-cut had been conceived in a humorous sense, but there is\r\nno doubt whatever that such duels did really take place in Germany,\r\nthough cases of the kind were probably comparatively rare after the\r\ntwelfth century; and, indeed, Mr. Pearsall had not been able to find\r\nany record of an actual combat of the kind later than the year 1200,\r\nwhen a man and his wife are stated to have fought under the sanction\r\nof the civic authorities at Bâle. We may take it, however, from other\r\nevidence that the practice continued up to the close of the fourteenth\r\ncentury and perhaps even later. Reference is made in the paper to a\r\nbook of drawings, also at Munich, executed as late as the end of the\r\nfifteenth century, among which is a representation of such a duel,\r\nthough possibly traditional in character. The man here is depicted as\r\nburied up to the waist in a tub; he wears a skull-cap, and is armed in\r\nthe same manner as shown in the other drawing, with a short staff, the\r\nleft arm tied to his side. The woman is fully dressed and in the act\r\nof swinging a weapon which looks like a sling, in which is a stone.\r\nMr. Pearsall further refers to “an ancient codex of defence” in the\r\nlibrary at Gotha, one of the drawings depicting a duel between a man\r\nand his wife, the former fighting from a tub; and the man is shown\r\nto have vanquished the woman and drawn her into the tub headforemost,\r\nin which she appears with her legs kicking in the air. This incident\r\nexplains why the chemise, as shown on Fig. 2 of Kall’s work, was tied\r\nwith a lace between the legs; and that wood-cut also illustrates the\r\nmode of action on the part of the duelists in attack and defence. The\r\nwoman’s weapon is thus seen not to be a sling at all, but one similar\r\nin principle to the extended sleeve with a bag at the end in which is a\r\nstone; the object being to inflict a swinging blow on her opponent, who\r\nparries with his staff. Another cut, the source of which Mr. Pearsall\r\ndoes not mention, represents a more deadly form of duel between a man\r\nand a woman, who fight bare-headed and naked to the girdle, with small\r\nfalchions, like knives; and wounds are shown on both their persons.\r\n\r\nA singular form of duel, pictured in Paulus Kall’s book, is that with\r\n“_shilts_,” used as weapons both of attack and defence, sometimes\r\nalone, and at others in conjunction with daggers held in the disengaged\r\nhand. To judge from the wood-cuts this great oblong shield is about 4½\r\nfeet long by about 18 inches broad; and though the examples depicted\r\ndiffer somewhat, they are all garnished at the head, foot, and sides\r\nwith a greater or less number of projecting spears or spurs, for\r\nthe purposes of attack. The combatants are wearing greyish-brown\r\ntight-fitting dresses and hoods; the faces, hands and legs are left\r\nbare. The preliminaries completed, the duelists are conducted into the\r\nlists by an official; each combatant brings a bier and is accompanied\r\nby his relations and a confessor. The principals are then sworn, their\r\nweapons handed to them, and the onset sounded. It would appear from the\r\nsurrounding details and the character of the officials concerned, that\r\nthis form of duel appertained to members of the privileged class.\r\n\r\nA fourth kind of duel was fought with spiked clubs (or more usually\r\nwith swords) and “_der Hutt_,” a shield formed like a hat; and Kall’s\r\nwood-cut pictures the duelists as being clad in garments of cloth.\r\nThe shields vary in size from very small to very large, the latter\r\nkind being employed in conjunction with spiked clubs, the former with\r\nswords. Another form of duel is with the “_streit-axt_” (_bec de\r\nfaucon_), the variety of battle-axe with a hammer on one side of the\r\nhead and a spike, like that of a pick, on the other. Here the champions\r\nfight in complete armour; and besides axes they carry swords and\r\ndaggers. In the Gotha codex is a drawing entitled, “_Dass ist wie sich\r\nainer versorgen sol der zu gewapenter Hand fechten sol_,” meaning that\r\nthis is the equipment for a duel with gauntlets. The duelist is shown\r\nas being anointed with oil by his armourer preparatory to combat; and\r\nthe items of his body-armour stand ready to be put on in their turn.\r\nSome of the wood-cuts in Paulus Kall’s work afford representations of\r\nsuch duels; and the text furnishes directions as to how they were to be\r\nconducted. It was from this kind of legal duel, more especially, that\r\ncombats on foot in the lists at a _pas d’armes_ had their origin.\r\n\r\nThe last form of duel referred to in Mr. Pearsall’s paper is one with\r\ntwo-handed swords; and a wood-cut of Paulus Kall’s illustrates a combat\r\nof the kind, in which the duelists are clad in jerkins and long hose.\r\nThe swords appear to measure about five feet in length. These clumsy\r\nand unwieldy weapons were for striking and parrying, but could not be\r\nemployed effectively at close quarters.\r\n\r\nAn original manuscript in the possession of Mr. Richard Bull, F.S.A.,\r\nat the commencement of the nineteenth century, contains the orders,\r\nrules and regulations issued by Thomas Duke of Gloucester, the\r\nConstable of England, in the reign of King Richard II, 1377-99, for\r\nobservance in cases of trial by combat.[265] They differ little from\r\nthose of an earlier period, but the particulars given of the lists may\r\nbe noted with advantage. They run:—\r\n\r\n“The Kinge shall finde the feeld to fight in and the listes shalbe\r\nmade and deuised by the Constable and it is to be considered that the\r\nlistes must be 60 pace longe and equally made without greate stones the\r\ngrounde flat and 40 paces brode in good order and that the grounde be\r\nharde stable and firme and that the lists be strongly barred abowt with\r\none dore in the este an other in the weste with good and stronge barres\r\nseven foote highe or more than a horse can leape over them.”\r\n\r\nThe weapons were to be “glayues,”[266] long sword, short sword and\r\ndagger.\r\n\r\nThere are other copies of these rules extant besides the one given in\r\nthe _Antiquarian Repertory_, viz., Ashmole MS. 856, 83-89, and that\r\namong a MS. Collection of Ordinances of Chivalry of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, belonging to Lord Hastings. The last-named document is copied\r\nin Lord Dillon’s paper on these Hastings MS.,[267] published in\r\n_Archæologia_, Vol. LVII, and is reproduced in our Appendix H, but\r\nwith the long preamble left out. These three copies of the rules for\r\nconducting judicial duels in the reign of Richard II vary somewhat; for\r\ninstance, glaives[268] are mentioned in the two first copies as being\r\namong the weapons employed in these combats, but not in the last.\r\n\r\n\r\nRULES FOR JUDICIAL COMBATS IN THE REIGN OF RICHARD III[269]\r\n\r\nA case lodged by an appellant should be pleaded in the court before the\r\nconstable and marshal, and if the accusation cannot be substantiated by\r\nwitnesses, a recourse to trial by combat may be granted by the Crown.\r\nShould a judicial duel be decided on, the time and place of combat are\r\nfixed by the constable; the weapons to be “glayves,” long-swords, short\r\nswords and daggers. Sureties to be found by both parties to keep their\r\nday, and no attempt shall be made to injure the plaintiff or defendant\r\nbefore the day of battle.\r\n\r\nThe general rules and arrangements do not differ materially from\r\nthose of earlier reigns, though here it is mentioned that spears of\r\nequal length were issued to the combatants, thus explaining the term\r\n“glayves.”\r\n\r\nIf the charge be one of treason the vanquished shall be stripped of his\r\narmour, and a piece of the railings of the lists broken down, and he\r\nshall be drawn through the lists by horses to the place of execution.\r\n\r\nA judicial combat took place at Quesnoy in 1405, Duke William, Count of\r\nHainult, sitting as judge. The parties were two gentlemen, Bournecte\r\nthe appellant and Bounaige the defendant. The accusation was that of\r\nmurder. Lists were erected at the expense of the Duke, and the fight\r\ncommenced by each combatant hurling his lance at the other, but without\r\neffect; they then drew their swords, and Bournecte soon overcame his\r\nadversary, who confessed his crime, and was ordered by the judge to be\r\nbeheaded. This was a duel between members of the privileged class.\r\n\r\nA challenge for a duel between Henry Inglose, Esq., and Sir John\r\nTiptoft, Knt., to be fought before the Duke of Bedford, high constable,\r\nin 1415. (Cotton MS. Titus. C. 28.)\r\n\r\nA trial by combat took place at Arras in the year 1431, the Duke of\r\nBurgundy sitting as judge. The charge was one of treason, and about\r\nthe time of the duel many allegiances were being transferred from\r\nBurgundy to France. The appellant, Maillotin de Bours, had charged\r\nthe defendant, Hector de Flavy, with having expressed the intention\r\nof deserting the Burgundian interest in favour of that of France and\r\nwith other contemplated acts of treason. On this information the Duke\r\nhad de Flavy arrested and lodged in prison. The defendant, however,\r\nhad many influential friends at Court, and through their good offices\r\nand representations he was at length received in audience by his\r\nsovereign, when he solemnly denied the charge, alleging that it was\r\nde Bours himself who had suggested the treason. The Duke then sent\r\nfor the appellant, and the discussion between the parties waxed very\r\nviolent until at length de Bours flung down his glove and demanded a\r\ntrial by combat, God showing the right. The defendant, with the Duke’s\r\npermission, took up the glove and a day was fixed for the combat to\r\ntake place, both parties giving security to keep their tryst. Lists\r\nwere prepared and erected. Within them was the model of a sepulchre,\r\nfor de Flavy had been dubbed a knight before the Holy Sepulchre at\r\nJerusalem. On the day of combat the Duke took his seat on the tribune\r\nprepared for him. De Maillotin first entered the lists armed at all\r\npoints, attended by the Seigneur de Charny and other sponsors. He\r\nheld a lance in one hand and one of his two swords in the other, and\r\nafter making his obeisance to the Duke he retired to his pavilion. Sir\r\nHector de Flavy entered the lists in like manner; he was influentially\r\nattended, and his charger was led in by the two sons of the Comte de\r\nSt. Pol. After saluting the Duke he also retired to his pavilion. Both\r\nknights on re-entering the lists were led before the judge and swore\r\non the Evangelists that their cause was just and true. They then took\r\nup their positions for combat and the onset was sounded, the fight\r\nbeginning by each hurling his lance at the other, but without hurt\r\nto either. They then attacked with swords, each champion displaying\r\nthe utmost courage and dexterity. The Duke at this juncture quite\r\nunexpectedly cast his bâton, thus putting an end to the fight. He\r\ncommanded the attendance of the combatants to dine at his table on the\r\nmorrow, when he reconciled them to each other.[270]\r\n\r\n“In the foure and twentith yeare” of the reign of King Henry VI (1446)\r\n“the prior of Kilmaine appeached the earle of Ormond of treason. For\r\ntriall whereof the place of combat was assigned in Smithfelde, and the\r\nbarriers for the same there readie pitcht. Howbeit, in the meane time a\r\ndoctor of diuinitie, named maister Gilbert Worthington, parson of saint\r\nAndrews in Holborne, and other honest men, made such sute with diligent\r\nlabor and paines taking to the kings councell, that when the daie of\r\ncombat approched, the quarell was taken into the kings hands and there\r\nended”.[271]\r\n\r\n“In the same year also, a certeine armourer was appeached of treason by\r\na seruant of his owne. For proofe whereof a day was giun them to fight\r\nin Smithfield, insomuch that in conflict the said armourer was ouercome\r\nand slaine; but yet by misgouerning of himselfe. For in the morning,\r\nwhen he should come to the field fresh and fasting, his neighbours\r\ncame to him, and gaue him wine and strong drinke in such excessiue\r\nsort, that he was therewith distempered, and reeled as he went, and so\r\nwas slaine without guilt. As for the false seruant, he liued not long\r\nvnpunished; for being conuict of felonie in court of assise, he was\r\njudged to be hanged, and so he was, at Tilburne.”[272]\r\n\r\nA good example of a judicial duel, fought in the year 1455, is given in\r\n_Histoire des Ducs De Bourgogne_.[273] It took place at Valenciennes,\r\na town then belonging to the county of Hainault, which, with so many\r\nother rich manufacturing territories had fallen under the dominion\r\nof the dukes of Burgundy, by marriage or conquest. The privilege of\r\nsanctuary had been conferred on the town by its ancient counts, and\r\nthe old rights and charters had been confirmed by the dukes their\r\nsuccessors. A person named Mahiot Coquel, a tailor of Tournay, had\r\nmurdered a man in that town, and he took refuge from justice in\r\nValenciennes, claiming the right of sanctuary. Soon after his arrival a\r\nnear relative of the murdered man named Jacotin Plouvier, met him in a\r\nstreet of the town and threatened vengeance against him for the murder\r\nof his kinsman; upon which Coquel applied to the magistracy, demanding\r\ntheir aid and counsel. The syndic then sent for Plouvier and reproached\r\nhim with having the intention of violating the franchise of his town;\r\nbut he denied this and claimed the right of lawful combat as against\r\nCoquel, at the same time throwing down a gage of battle. This, after\r\nsome hesitation, Coquel lifted up; and a combat was allowed as being\r\nthe law of the land, without being any infringement of the principle\r\nof sanctuary, which only applied to protection from the officers of\r\njustice. The parties were lodged in prison in separate cells, and\r\nseconds were appointed to arrange the preliminaries for the fight;\r\nwhen the Comte de Charolais, afterwards Charles the Bold, on being\r\ninformed of the case, acting in the capacity of lieutenant-general for\r\nhis father Duke Philippe le Bon, of Burgundy, ordered the matter to be\r\nreferred to his council for judgment. The town authorities then applied\r\nto the Duke their sovereign lord for the maintenance of their ancient\r\nrights, when all opposition to the combat was withdrawn; the Duke\r\nannouncing his intention of being present, with his son the Comte de\r\nCharolais, to view the fight. Lists were erected, not in the form usual\r\nfor the tourney, but round and with only a single entrance. The judges\r\nof the fight were the provosts of the town of Valenciennes and of the\r\ncounty of Hainault, the Duke and his son being merely spectators. Two\r\nseats draped with black cloth were placed facing each other in the\r\nmiddle of the lists, and the combatants were conducted to them and\r\nsworn on the Evangelists. The two champions were clad in leathern\r\ngarments, close-fitting and laced down the middles, the arms and legs\r\nbare. These corselets were well greased so that neither of the parties\r\ncould easily grip the other. Their hands were rubbed with ashes for the\r\nbetter grasping of their weapons, and each held a piece of sugar in his\r\nmouth as a preventive against their throats becoming parched with the\r\nheat. Their weapons were knotted clubs, equal in weight and length and\r\nobtusely pointed at the narrower ends, and triangular shields, painted\r\nred. When the signal for combat had been given Mahiot Coquel, who\r\nwas the shorter and weaker man of the two, grasped a handful of sand\r\nwith which the lists were strewn, and threw it into the eyes of his\r\nopponent. This nearly blinded Jacotin for the moment, and he received\r\na heavy blow in the face from the club of his adversary, but on\r\nrecovering somewhat he set upon Mahiot and seizing him by the arm threw\r\nhim violently to the ground, then placing his knees on his stomach, to\r\nthe horror of the spectators, he kept steadily prodding Mahiot between\r\nthe eyes with the pointed end of his club until he was dead. The body\r\nwas then dragged by the hangman from the lists to the gallows.\r\n\r\nLacroix in _Military an Religious Life in the Middle Ages, ＆c._, gives\r\na picture of a judicial duel of the knightly kind, fought on foot. It\r\nis copied from a miniature in the _Conquêtes de Charlemagne_, a MS.,\r\nin the National Library at Paris. The combatants are armed at all\r\npoints; their weapons are swords; and the lists, of open railings, are\r\noctagonal in form.\r\n\r\nThe general course of procedure in these matters continued much the\r\nsame up to and including the reign of Henry VIII. A manuscript of\r\nthat reign, sometime belonging to Sir Edward Wyndham, Kt., Marshal to\r\nthe Camp, gives particulars,[274] The form and size of the lists and\r\ncounter-lists are as before; also the kind of weapons to be employed.\r\nThe defendant, if he appear not, is called by proclamation, made by the\r\nmarshal of the king of “Heraults of that province wherein the Battail\r\nis to be deraigned.” The bill of challenge of the appellant and the\r\nanswer of the defendant is read to them and they take their oaths:—\r\n\r\n    1. That their appeal and defence is true.\r\n    2. That neither hath advantage of the other in weapons.\r\n    3. That each will do his best to vanquish his enemy.\r\n\r\nThe combatants being ready, the constable and marshal, sitting at the\r\nking’s feet, order the onset to be sounded, pronouncing the words in\r\nhigh voice, “Lesses les aller et fair leur devoir.”\r\n\r\n“In the fight if either of the parties do give sign of yielding or if\r\nthe king, being present, do cry ‘Hoe,’ the constable and marshall do\r\npart them and observe precisely who hathe advantage or disadvantage\r\neither of the other at that instant, for if they should be awarded\r\nto fight again, they are to be put in the same position as they were\r\nbefore.”\r\n\r\n“If the king take up the matter they are brought honourably out of the\r\nlists, neither having precedency over the other.”\r\n\r\nIf the “Battail” be performed and one party be vanquished then “in\r\ncase of Treason the rayles of the lists are broken down, and the party\r\nvanquished is drawn at a Horse-tayl and carried presently to execution.”\r\n\r\nThe last instance of a duly authorised legal duel in France was\r\nthat between François de Vivonne de la Chataignerie and Guy Chabot\r\nde Jarnac, which took place at St. Germain-en-Laye in 1547, in the\r\npresence of the king (Henry II.) It is doubly remarkable in that it\r\ncontributed a new and subtil stroke of the sword, the “coup de Jarnac,”\r\nand that it led to an edict being issued against duelling. This ordeal\r\nby combat resulted in the death of de la Chataignerie.\r\n\r\nJudicial Duel in 1548, 2nd Edward VI, between one Newton, a Scot, and\r\na gentleman named Hamilton; the former being charged with uttering\r\nopprobrious epithets against His Majesty of England. Lists were\r\nerected in the market-place of Haddington, and at the time appointed\r\nthe parties entered them for combat, clad in their doublets and hose,\r\nand armed with sword, buckler and dagger. The fight began with great\r\nspirit, Hamilton following his adversary up to the very railing of the\r\nlists, whereupon Newton struck him on the leg with his sword inflicting\r\na great gash, upon which he fell to the ground and was slain. This\r\nending of the fight was looked upon as a miscarriage of justice.[275]\r\n\r\nThe Abbé de Brantôme reports a trial by combat which took place about\r\nthe middle of the sixteenth century, without the sanction of either\r\nking or parliament. The appellant was a Seigneur de Fandilles who\r\ncharged the defendant, the Baron de Guerres of Lorraine, with an odious\r\ncrime; and it was mutually agreed that the matter be referred to the\r\njudgment of God, in battle in the lists. The fight took place on foot\r\nwith “bastardes” (hand and a half swords) in the lists at Sedan, a\r\nM. de Bouillon acting as judge. De Fandilles severely wounded his\r\nadversary in the thigh with a stroke of his powerful weapon, and the\r\nloss of blood was so great that the defendant could hardly keep his\r\nfeet, at length falling to the ground. The lists were as usual freely\r\nstrewn with sand, and the baron clutched handfuls of it which he threw\r\ninto the eyes of his opponent, who was blinded for the time being and\r\nincapacitated from continuing the combat. This ending of the duel by\r\nmeans of an action strictly forbidden by the laws of the duello caused\r\ngreat disputes between the seconds and friends of both parties; and the\r\nmatter was further complicated by a fall of the stand which afforded\r\naccommodation to the judge and spectators. This was certainly an\r\nirregular judicial duel, without any sanction at law, though the legal\r\nforms were observed.\r\n\r\nBrantôme narrates several other duels.\r\n\r\nIn Harleian M.S., Vol. III, 505, 7021-22, is a catalogue of judicial\r\ncombats anciently granted by the kings of England.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Queen Elizabeth judicial duels had become rare, and the\r\ncrown employed all its influence in their restraint. Fierce polemics\r\nhad arisen in regard to the lawfulness or otherwise of the practice,\r\nand the conscience of the nation had been thoroughly aroused against\r\nthem by reason of cases of more than suspected miscarriage of justice\r\ncoming to light. Strong influence was brought to bear on the law courts\r\nto place all possible obstacles in the way of granting licences for\r\nsuch combats, and judges, at that time more especially, usually managed\r\nthat disputes concerning the possession of land should be settled\r\nin the law courts without any resort to the ordeal of battle. Many\r\ntreatises were written against the practice, examples of which follow:\r\nAshmole MSS., No. 856, p. 10. “Duello foild. The whole proceedings\r\nin the orderly dissolveing of a designe for single fight betweene\r\ntwo valient gentlemen; by occasion whereof the unlawfulnesse of a\r\nduello is preparatorily disputed, according to the rules of honour and\r\nright reason; written by the Lord Henry Howard Earle of Northampton.”\r\n126-145, p. 11. “A Discourse touching the unlawfulnesse of private\r\ncombates, written by Sir Edward Cooke Lord Chiefe Justice of England,\r\nat the request of the Lord Henry Howard Earle of Northampton.” (3 Oct.,\r\n1609.) 146-148. “Ex MS. in Bibl’ Hatton.”\r\n\r\nCotton MS. Titus. Fol. 33. A treatise on duels, in two books. (239.)\r\nFol. 38. Two papers on measures taken against duels. (402.) Fol. 44. A\r\npaper concerning laws against duels. (416.)\r\n\r\nOn the 18th June, 1571, a judicial duel was ordered to take place, the\r\nprincipals being Simon Low and John Kime, who were to fight by proxy in\r\nthe persons of George Thome and Henry Nailer, respectively. The dispute\r\nbetween the parties related to the possession of some land; and the\r\nweapons for the intended fight were to be bastons and leathern shields.\r\nA plot of ground, 21 yards square, in Tothill Fields, was doubly railed\r\nin for the fight, and a stand connected with it was erected for the\r\nchief justice, as representing the court of common pleas. Behind it two\r\ntents were pitched for the use of the combatants. The Queen was much\r\nagainst the fighting, and the combat did not come off after all, for\r\nthe champion of the appellant failed at the last moment to put in an\r\nappearance, so the plaintiff was non-suited.\r\n\r\nDuels of the privileged order naturally survived those of the\r\nproletariat. Ashmole MS., No. 856, p. 7, gives “The manner of the\r\nchallendge made by the Earle of Northumberland against Sir Francis\r\nVeare,” both by letter dated 24 Apr. 1602, and by inter-messages, until\r\nforbidden by the Queen’s commandment. (107-111.) Ex. MS. in Bibl’\r\nHatton, and, under the same number, P. 16. “The manner of Donald Ld\r\nRey, and David Ramsey esq. their comeing and carriage at their tryall,\r\nupon monday, the 28 of November, 1631, before the Ld of Lynsey, Lord\r\nHigh Constable of England, and others.” This is a very full report of\r\nthe trial. (175-227.) Under No. 856, p. 15. “His MAᵗˢ: declaration\r\nagainst duells, published at his chappell at Bruxells upon sonday the\r\n24th of November 1658.” (172.)\r\n\r\nThough practically in abeyance for a long period the law for an appeal\r\nto combat had remained on the statute book; and a trial by battle\r\nwas demanded as late as the year 1817, in the case of Thornton _v._\r\nAshford. The judge, Lord Ellenborough, pronounced “that the general law\r\nof the land is that there shall be a trial by battle in case of appeal\r\nunless the parties bring themselves within the scope of one of the\r\nexemptions.” The suit was allowed, but the challenge being refused no\r\ncombat ensued. The law was repealed in the following year (1818).[276]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[244] _Origines Juridiciales_, p. 65.\r\n\r\n[245] Pollock and Maitland, _History of English Law_, I, 39.\r\n\r\n[246] Pollock and Maitland, _History of English Law_, I, 147.\r\n\r\n[247] _Origines Juridiciales_, p. 79.\r\n\r\n[248] Published in 1671, by William Dugdale Esquire, Norroy King of\r\nArms, later Sir William and Garter King of Arms; the ordinances, etc.,\r\nbeing those in operation in the reign of Henry II, set forth by Ranulph\r\nde Glanville, Justice of England, page 65.\r\n\r\n[249] _Origines_, p. 68.\r\n\r\n[250] Bastons were sometimes headed with a double beak, like a pick.\r\nTheir usual length was three feet, though shorter ones could be used in\r\nthe event of combatants mutually wishing it.\r\n\r\n[251] Vol. I, p. 375.\r\n\r\n[252] _Theatre of Honour and Knighthood_, Chap.

And when they may not prove ther cause by witnesse.nor bi\r\nnon other manner but detrmine ther quarell bi strengthe.the ton for to\r\nprove his entent up on the tother. And the tother in the same manner\r\nfor to defende him. The constable hath power for to ioyne that batayle\r\nas vecarie genrall undir god ＆ the kynge and the bataile conioynt by\r\nthe Constable.he schal assigne them day and place.so that the day be\r\nnot within xl.dayes after the saide batell soo conioynt.but yf it be bi\r\nthe consentinge of the seyde appellaunt and defendaunt. Than he schall\r\nawarde them.poyntes of armes.other wise callid wepenes.ayther of them\r\nschal have.that is to say.longe swerde schorte swerde and dagger.so\r\nthat the appellant and defendaunt.fynde sufficianunt surete ＆ plegges\r\nthat echou of them schal come at his seyde day.the appellaunt for to\r\ndoo his power up on the defendaunt.and the defendaunt in his defence\r\nup on the appellaunt. And this to be done.schall be gevyn un to the\r\nappellaunt hour terme and soon.for to make his preve and der (sic)\r\nand for to bethe firste within the listes. for to quite his plegges.\r\nAnd of the same wise of the defendaunt. And noon of hem schall do\r\nhevinesse.ille harme awaite assaute.nor non other grevaunce.nor ennye\r\nbi them nor bi non of ther frendes welwillinge.nor bi non other who soo\r\never it be. The kynge schal fynde the felde.for to feght in. And the\r\n(f. 125b) listes schal be made and devisid by the constable. And it\r\nis to be considerid that the listes schal be.lx.pases of lengthe and\r\nxl.paces of brede in good manner.and that the erthe be ferme stable\r\nand harde.and even made, without grete stones and that the erthe be\r\nplat.and that the listes be strongli barred rounde aboute and a gate\r\nin the este and a nother in the weste with good and stronge barrers\r\nof vij.foote of heyght or more. And it is to wite that ther schulde\r\nbe faux listes withouten the principal listes betwene the whiche the\r\nmen of the constable and the marchall and s’gauntes of armes of the\r\nkynges schulde be for to kepe and defend yf any wolde make any offence\r\nor fray azens the cries made in the courte in any thinge that myght\r\nbe agayns the kynges Roiall mageste or lawe of armes and these men\r\nschulde be armed at all poyntes. The Constable schal have there as\r\nmany men of armes as he will and the marchall also bi the assignacion\r\nof the Constable and ellis not the whiche men schal have the kepynge\r\nas is seyde. The s’gauntes of armes of the kynge schal have the keping\r\nof gates of the listes and the arestinges yf any schal be made bi the\r\ncomaudemt of the seyde Constable and Marchall. The day of bataile the\r\nkynge schal be in a sege or in a shaffold on heght and a place schal\r\nbe made for the Constable and marchall at the stayre foot of the seyde\r\nshaffold there where thei schal be. And than schal be axed the plegges\r\nof the appellaunt and defendaunt for to come in to the listes afore the\r\nkynge and present in the courte as prisioners un to the appellaunt and\r\ndefendaunt be come in the listes and have made ther othes. When the ap\r\n(f. 126) pellaunt cometh to his iorney he schale come to the gate of\r\nthe listes in the Este in such manner as he will feght with his armes\r\nand wepenis assignid to him bi the courte and ther he schal abide til\r\nhe be led in bi the Constable so that when he is comen to the seyde\r\ngate the Constable and marchall schal goo thedir. And the Constable\r\nschal axe him what man he is whiche is comen armed to the gate of the\r\nlistes. And what name he hathe and for what cause he is comen. And the\r\nappellaunt schal answere I am suche aman. A. de. K. the appellaunt the\r\nwhiche is come to this iorney ＆c for to doo ＆c. And than the Constable\r\nschal open the viser of his basinet soo that he may playnli see his\r\nvisage and if it be the same man that is the appellaunt than schal he\r\nmake open the gates of the listes and schal make him entre with his\r\nseyde armes poyntes vitailes and other leuefull necessaries up on him\r\nand also his counsell with him and than he schal lede him afore the\r\nkynge and than to his tente where he schal abide til the defendaunt be\r\ncomen. In the same manner schal be done of the defendaunt but that he\r\nschal entre in at the weste gate of the listes. The Constable clerk\r\nschal write and sette in the regestre the comyge and the houre of the\r\nentringe of the appellaunt and how that he entreth the listes on fote\r\nand also the harnyes of the appellaunt how that he is armed and with\r\nhow many wepenis he entreth the listes and what vitailes and other\r\nleueful necessaries he bringeth in with him. In the same manner schal\r\nbe don to the defendaunt. Also the Constable schal mak take hede that\r\nnon other before ne behinde the appellaunt (f. 126b) nor the defendaunt\r\nbrynge more wepin nor vitailes other then were assignid bi the courte.\r\nAnd yf it be soo that the defendaunt come not be time to his iorney and\r\nat the oure and terme limit bi the courte the Constable schal comaunde\r\nthe marchall for to make calle him at the four corners of the listes\r\nthe whiche schal be done in manner as it foloweth. Oyes. Oyez. Oyez.\r\nC. de. B. defendaunt come to yowre Jorney whiche ye have undirtake at\r\nthis day for to aquite yowre plegges before the kinge the constable\r\nand marchall in yowre defence agayns. A. de K. appellaunt of that\r\nthat he hathe put up on yow. And yf he come not be time he schal be\r\ncallid the secunde time in the same manner and at the ende he schal say\r\ncome the day passeth faste and yf he come not at that time he schal\r\nbe callid the thridde time. But that this be betwixe hye tierce and\r\nnone. In the same manner as before and at the ende he schal say the\r\nday passeth faste and the oure of none is nye soo that ye come bi the\r\nseyde oure of none at farrest in pitt that may come. But how soo ever\r\nthe Constable hathe yevy oure and terme un to the defendaunt for to\r\ncome to his Jorney never the lesse yf that he tarie un to the oure of\r\nnone the Jugement schulde not bi right goo agayns him whethir it be in\r\ncas of treson or not. But soo is it not of the appellaunt for he muste\r\nholde the houre and time limitid bi the courte withoute any plonginge\r\nor excusacon what soo ever be it in cause of treson. The appellaunt\r\nand the defendaunt entrede in the (f. 127) listes with ther armoure\r\nwepenes vitailes and leuefull necessaries and counsell as is seyde\r\nand as thei are assigned bi the courte. The Constable schal wete the\r\nkinges wille yf he wil assigne any of his noble lordes or knyghtes of\r\nworschipe un to the sayde pties and yf he wil that the othes be made\r\nafore him or afore the Constable and marchal. And the appellaunt and\r\ndefendaunt schal be serchid bi the Constable and marchall of there\r\npoyntes of armes otherwise callid wepenis that they be vowable without\r\nany man disseyte on them and yf thei be other than reson axeth they\r\nschal be taken away ffor reson good feythe and lawe of arms wil not\r\nsuffre no gile nor dissayte in soo gret a dede. And it is to wite\r\nthat the appellaunt and defendaunt may be armed as sewrely upon ther\r\nbodies as they will. And than the Constable schal sende firste after\r\nthe marchall and than for the appellaunt with his counsell for to make\r\nhis othe. The Constable schal axe him yf he wil any more protest and\r\nthat he putte forthe all his ptestacions bi writinge for fro that time\r\nforthe he schal make no ptestacion. The constable schal have his clerke\r\nredy in his presence that schal ley forthe a masse book open. And\r\nthan the Constable schal make his seyde clerke rede the bille of the\r\nappellaunt enterly on heyght and the bille redde the constable schal\r\nsay to the appellaunt A. de K. thou knowest wel this bille and this\r\nwarant and wedd’ that thou gave in oure courte thou schal lay thi right\r\nhonde here up on these seyntes and schal swere in maner as foloweth\r\n(f. 127b). Thou. A.de.K. this thi bille is sothe in all poyntes and\r\narticles fro the beginyge contenynge theirn to the ende and that is\r\nthine entente to preve this day on the forsayde. C.de.B. so god the\r\nhelpe and theise halowes and this othe made he schal be led agayne to\r\nhis place. The constable schal make the marchal calle the defendaunt\r\nand soo schal be done to the defendaunt in the same manner as to the\r\nappellaunt. And than the Constable schal make calle bi the marchall the\r\nappellaunt agayne and schal make him leye his honde as he did afore\r\nup on the masse book and schal say. A.de.K. thou swerest that thou ne\r\nhaste ne schalt have mo poyntes ne poyntes on the ne on thi bodi within\r\nthese listes but thei that ben assignid bi the courte that is to say.\r\na longe swerde schorte swerde and dagger nor non other knyf litill\r\nnor mekill ne non other instrument ne engyn of poynte ne other wise\r\nne stone of vrtu ne herbe of vrtu ne charme ne expirmet ne karecte no\r\nnon other inchauntemt bi the ne for the bi the whiche thou tristest\r\nthe better to overcome the forseyde.

In the same wise schal\r\nbe done to the defendaunt. The whiche othes made and ther chambirleyns\r\nand srvauntes put a way. the Constable schal make calle bi the marchall\r\nthe appellaunt and the defendaunt also the whiche schal be ledde (f.\r\n128) and kepte bi the men of the Constable and marchall before them\r\nand the Constable schal say to bothe the pties. Thou A.de.K. appellour\r\nschal take. C.de.B. defendoure bi the rigt honde and he the. And we\r\ndefende yow and echone of yow in the kinges name and up on the pill\r\nthat longeth therto and up on pill of lesinge yowre quarell the whiche\r\nthat is founden in defaute that non of yow be so hardy to doo to other\r\nille ne grevauce thirstinge nor other harme bi the honde up on the pill\r\nafore sayde and this charge gevy. the Constable schal make yeve ther\r\nright hondis to gedir and ther lifte hondes up on the missale sayinge\r\nto the appeloure. A.de.K. appelloure thou swerest bi the feythe that\r\nthou yevest in the honde of thine advsarie. C.de.B. defondoure and\r\nbi all the halowe that thou toucheste with thi lifte honde that thou\r\nto-day this day schal doo all thi trewe power and entente bi all the\r\nweyes that thou beste may or kanste to preve thine entente on.

A.de.K. thin advsarie appelloure\r\nbi the feythe and soo helpe the god and all these halowes. And than the\r\nConstable schall comaunde the marchall for to crie at the foure corners\r\nof the listes in manner as foloweth. Oyez. Oyez. Oyez. We charge and\r\ncomaunde bi the kynges Constable and marschall that non of gret valew\r\n＆ of litill estate of what condicion or nacion that he be. be so hardy\r\nhens forewarde for to come negh the listes bi foure foote nor to speke\r\nnor to crie nor to make contenance nor token nor semblaunce nor noyse\r\nwhere bi nouther of these two prties. A.de.K. appellor ＆. C.de.B.\r\ndefendour may take avauntage the ton up on the tother up on pill of\r\nlesinge lyf and membre and ther goodes at the kinges wille. And after\r\nthe Constable and marchall schal avoyde all manner of pepill oute of\r\nthe listes except their luftenauntz and two knyghtes for the Constable\r\nand marchall whiche schal be armed up on there bodies but they schal\r\nhave nother knyf nor swerde up on them nor non other wepenes wherbi\r\nthe appellaunt other the defendaunt may have therof any avauntage bi\r\nnegligence of kepinge of them. But the two luftenauntz of the Constable\r\nand marchall schal have in there handes outher a spere wtoute yren\r\nfor to depte them yf the kinge will make them abide in ther feghtinge\r\nwhether it be to reste them or other thinge what som ever him liketh.\r\nAnd it is to be knowen that if yf any adminstracion schulde be made to\r\nthe appellaunt or to the defendaunt of mete or of drinke or any other\r\nnecessarie thinge leeful after (f. 129) that the counsell of frendes\r\nand s’vauntz ben put away of the appellaunt and of the defendaunt as\r\nis seyde the seyde adminstracion apteneth to the herawdes and also\r\nall the cries made in the seyde courte the whiche kingsz heraudes and\r\npursevauntes schal have a place for the assignid bi the Constable and\r\nmarchall as nye the listes as may goodli be soo that they may see all\r\nthe dede ＆ to be redy yf thei be callid for to doo any thinge. The\r\nappellaunt in his place kepte bi som men assignid by the Constable or\r\nmarchall ＆ the defendaunt in his place in the same wise. Bothe two\r\nmade redy and arayed ＆ with feleschipe bi ther kepers above sayde the\r\nmarchall with the ton ptie ＆ the levetenant of the Constable with the\r\ntother. The Constable sittinge in his place above sayde afore the kinge\r\nas his viker genrall and pties made redy for the feghte as is sayde\r\nbi the comaundement of the kinge. The constable schal say with hye\r\nvoyce as foloweth. lessiez lez aler. that is to say lat them goo and\r\nreste a while. lessiez lez aler and reste a nother while. lessiez lez\r\naler ＆ fair leur devoir depdieu. that is to say lat them goo and doo\r\nther devour in goddes name. And this seyde eche man schal depte fro\r\nbothe pties soo that they may incountre ＆ doo that them semeth beste.\r\nThe appellaunt ne the defendaunt may nouther ete nor drinke fro that\r\ntime forthe withoute leve ＆ licence of the kinge for thinge that myght\r\nfalle but yf thei wol do it bi the consentinge betwixe them. Fro this\r\ntime forthe it is to be considered diligentli bi the constable that\r\nyf the kinge will make the pties feghtinge depte reste or abide (f.\r\n129b) for wham som ever cause it be that he take good kepe how thei\r\nare deptid so that thei be in the same estate and degre in all thinges\r\nyf the kinge wil sure or make them goo to gedir agayne and also that\r\nhe have good harkeninge and syghte un to them yf outher speke to other\r\nbe it of yeldinge or other wise for un to him longeth the witnesse and\r\nthe recorde of the wordes fro that time forthe ＆ to non other. And\r\nyf the seyde batell of treson he that is convicte ＆ discomfit schal\r\nbe disarmed in the listes bi the comaundement of the Constable and a\r\ncorner of the listes broken in the reprove of him bi the whiche schal\r\nbe drawen oute with hors fro the same place there he is soo disarmed\r\nthorow the listis un to the place of iustice where he schal be hedid\r\nor hongid after the usage of the cuntre the whiche thinge apenteth to\r\nthe marchall and to ovrsee and to pforme his seyde office and to put\r\nhim in execucion and to goo or ride and to be alwey bi him til it be\r\ndone and all pformed and aswel of the appellaunt as of the defendaunt\r\nfor good feythe and right and lawe of armes will that the appellaunt\r\nrenne in the same peyne that the defendaunt schulde doo if he were\r\ncovicte and discomfit. And yf it happen soo that the kinge wolde take\r\nthe quarell in his hande and make them acordid withoute more feghtinge.\r\nThan the Constable takinge the ton ptie and the marchall the tother and\r\nlede them afore the kinge and he schewinge them his wille the seedy\r\nConstable and marchall schal lede them to the on ptie of the listes\r\nwith all there pointz and armor as thei are founden and havyge when the\r\n(f. 130) kynge took the quarell in his honde as is seyde. And soo they\r\nschal be led oute of the gate of the listes evenly so that the ton goo\r\nnot afore the tother bi no wey in noo thinge for senne the hath taken\r\nthe quarell in his hande it schulde be dishonest that outher of the\r\npties schulde have mor disworschipe than the tother. Wherfore it hath\r\nben seyde bi many aunciaunt men that hee that gooth first oute of the\r\nlistes hath the disworschipe and this is aswel in cause of treson as\r\nin other cause what soo ever it be. The fee of the herawdes is all the\r\npoyntes ＆ armor brokin theis pt he taketh away or leveth after that he\r\nis entrid the listes aswel of the appellaunt as of the defendaunt and\r\nall the poyntes and armor of him that is discomfit be it the appellaunt\r\nother the defendaunt.
