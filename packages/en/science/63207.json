The train ran automatically, propelled by tiny\r\nelectric motors, the signals went up and down, the station was reached,\r\na bell rang, the train moved on again and was off on its journey around\r\nmany feet of track to come back over the old route.\r\n\r\nThe boy viewed his gift with raptured eyes, and then his face changed\r\nand he cried out in the bitterness of his disappointment: \"But what do I\r\ndo?\" The toy was so elaborate that the boy was left entirely out of the\r\nplay. Of course he did not like it. His cry tells a long story.\r\n\r\nThe prime instinct of almost any boy at play is to _make_ and to\r\n_create_. He will _make_ things of such materials as he has at hand, and\r\nuse the whole force of dream and fancy to create something out of\r\nnothing. The five-year-old will lay half a dozen wooden blocks together\r\nwith a spool on one end and tell you it is a steam train. And it is. He\r\nhas both made and created an engine, which he sees but which you don’t,\r\nfor the blocks and spool are only a symbol of his creation. Give his\r\nolder brother a telephone receiver, some wire and bits of brass, and he\r\nwill make a wireless telegraph outfit and listen to a steamship hundreds\r\nof miles away spell out its message to the shore.\r\n\r\nThe wireless outfit is not a symbol, but something that you can both\r\nhear and see in operation even though you may not understand the\r\nwhispering of the dots and dashes. And as soon as the mystery of this\r\nmodern wonder more firmly grips your imagination, you perhaps may come\r\nto realize that we are living more and more in the age of electricity\r\nand mechanism. Electricity propels our trains, lights our houses and\r\nstreets, makes our clothes, cures our ills, warms us, cooks for us and\r\nperforms an innumerable number of other tasks at the turning of a little\r\nswitch. A mere list is impossible.\r\n\r\nAlmost every boy experiments at one time or another with electricity and\r\nelectrical apparatus. It is my purpose in writing this book to open this\r\nwonderland of science and present it in a manner which can be readily\r\nunderstood, and wherein a boy may \"do something.\" Of course there are\r\nother books with the same purport, but they do not accomplish their end.\r\nThey are not practical. I can say this because as a boy I have read and\r\nstudied them and they have fallen far short of teaching me or my\r\ncompanions the things that we were seeking to learn. If they have failed\r\nin this respect, they have done so perhaps not through any inability of\r\nthe author, but from the fact that they have not been written from the\r\n_boy’s standpoint_. They tell what the author _thought_ a boy ought to\r\nknow but not what he really does want to know. The apparatus described\r\ntherein is for the most part imaginary. The author thought it might be\r\npossible for a boy to build motors, telegraph instruments, etc., out of\r\nold bolts and tin cans, but _he never tried to do so himself_.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus and experiments that I have described have been\r\nconstructed and carried out by _boys_. Their problems and their\r\nquestions have been studied and remedied. I have tried to present\r\npractical matter considered wholly from a boy’s standpoint, and to show\r\nthe young experimenter just what he can do with the tools and materials\r\nin his possession or not hard to obtain.\r\n\r\nTo the boy interested in science, a wide field is open. There is no\r\nbetter education for any boy than to begin at the bottom of the ladder\r\nand climb the rungs of scientific knowledge, step by step. It equips him\r\nwith information which may prove of inestimable worth in an opportune\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nThere is an apt illustration in the boy who watched his mother empty a\r\njug of molasses into a bowl and replace the cork. His mother told him\r\nnot to disturb the jug, as it was empty. He persisted, however, and\r\nturned the jug upside down. No more molasses came, but _out crawled a\r\nfly_. New developments in science will never cease. Invention will\r\nfollow invention. The unexpected is often a valuable clue. The Edisons\r\nand Teslas of to-day have not discovered everything. _There is a fly in\r\nthe molasses_, to be had by persistence. Inspiration is but a\r\nstarting-point. Success means work, days, nights, weeks, and years.\r\n\r\nThere can be no boy who will follow exactly any directions given to him,\r\nor do exactly as he is told, of his own free will. He will \"bolt\" at the\r\nfirst opportunity. If forced or obliged to do as he is directed, his\r\naction will be accompanied by many a \"why?\" Therefore in presenting the\r\nfollowing chapters I have not only told how to _make_ the various\r\nmotors, telegraphs, telephones, radio receivers, etc. but have also\r\nexplained the principles of electricity upon which they depend for their\r\noperation, and how the same thing is accomplished in the every-day\r\nworld. In giving directions or offering cautions, I have usually stated\r\nthe reason for so doing, in the hope that this information may be a\r\nstimulant to the imagination of the young experimenter and a useful\r\nguide in enabling him to proceed along some of the strange roads on\r\nwhich he will surely go.\r\n\r\nALFRED P.

Upon looking further around about him he\r\nfound many other pieces of this peculiar hard black mineral, the smaller\r\nbits of which tended to cling to the nails and studs in the soles of his\r\nsandals.\r\n\r\nThis mineral, which was an ore of iron, consisting of iron and oxygen,\r\nwas found in a district known as Magnesia, and in this way soon became\r\nwidely known as the \"Magnesstone,\" or magnet.\r\n\r\nThis is the story of the discovery of the magnet. It exists in legends\r\nin various forms. As more masses of this magnetic ore were discovered in\r\nvarious parts of the world, the stories of its attractive power became\r\ngreatly exaggerated, especially during the Middle Ages. In fact,\r\nmagnetic mountains which would pull the iron nails out of ships, or,\r\nlater, move the compass needle far astray, did not lose their place\r\namong the terrors of the sea until nearly the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nFor many hundreds of years the magnet-stone was of little use to mankind\r\nsave as a curiosity which possessed the power of attracting small pieces\r\nof iron and steel and other magnets like itself. Then some one, no one\r\nknows who, discovered that if a magnet-stone were hung by a thread in a\r\nsuitable manner it would always tend to point North and South; and so\r\nthe \"Magnes-stone\" became also called the \"lodestone,\" or\r\n\"leading-stone.\"\r\n\r\nThese simple bits of lodestone suspended by a thread were the\r\nforerunners of the modern compass and were of great value to the ancient\r\nnavigators, for they enabled them to steer ships in cloudy weather when\r\nthe sun was obscured and on nights when the pole-star could not be seen.\r\n\r\nThe first real _compasses_ were called _gnomons_, and consisted of a\r\nsteel needle which had been rubbed upon a lodestone until it acquired\r\nits magnetic properties. Then it was thrust through a reed or short\r\npiece of wood which supported it on the surface of a vessel of water. If\r\nthe needle was left in this receptacle, naturally it would move against\r\nthe side and not point a true position. Therefore it was given a\r\ncircular movement in the water, and as soon as it came to rest, the\r\npoint on the horizon which the north end designated was carefully noted\r\nand the ship’s course laid accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe modern mariners’ compass is quite a different arrangement. It\r\nconsists of three parts, the _bowl_, the _card_, and the _needle_. The\r\nbowl, which contains the card and needle, is usually a hemispherical\r\nbrass receptacle, suspended in a pair of brass rings, called _gimbals_,\r\nin such a manner that the bowl will remain horizontal no matter how\r\nviolently the ship may pitch and roll. The card, which is circular, is\r\ndivided into 32 equal parts called the _points of the compass_. The\r\nneedles, of which there are generally from two to four, are fastened to\r\nthe bottom of the card.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.—The Card of a Mariner’s Compass, Showing the\r\n\"Points.\"]\r\n\r\nIn the center of the card is a conical socket poised on an upright pin\r\nfixed in the bottom of the bowl, so that the card hanging on the pin\r\nturns freely around its center. On shipboard, the compass is so placed\r\nthat a black mark, called the _lubber’s line_, is fixed in a position\r\nparallel to the keel. The point on the compass-card which is directly\r\nagainst this line indicates the direction of the ship’s head.\r\n\r\n\r\nExperiments with Magnetism\r\n\r\n\r\nThe phenomena of magnetism and its laws form a very important branch of\r\nthe study of electricity, for they play an important part in the\r\nconstruction of almost all electrical apparatus.\r\n\r\nDynamos, motors, telegraphs, telephones, wireless apparatus, voltmeters,\r\nammeters, and so on through a practically endless list, depend upon\r\nmagnetism for their operation.\r\n\r\n*Artificial Magnets* are those made from steel by the application of a\r\nlodestone or some other magnetizing force.\r\n\r\nThe principal forms are the Bar and Horseshoe, so called from their\r\nshape. The process of making such a magnet is called _Magnetization_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.—A Bar Magnet]\r\n\r\nSmall horseshoe and bar magnets can be purchased at toy-stores. They can\r\nbe used to perform very interesting and instructive experiments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.—A Horseshoe Magnet]\r\n\r\nStroke a large darning-needle from end to end, always in the same\r\ndirection, with one end of a bar magnet. Then dip the needle in some\r\niron filings and it will be found that the filings will cling to the\r\nneedle. The needle has become a magnet.\r\n\r\nDip the bar magnet in some iron filings and it will be noticed that the\r\nfilings cling to the magnet in irregular tufts near the ends, with few\r\nif any near the middle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.—A Magnetized Needle and a Bar Magnet which have\r\nbeen dipped in Iron Filings.]\r\n\r\nThis experiment shows that the attractive power of a magnet exists in\r\n_two opposite_ places. These are called the poles.\r\n\r\nThere exists between magnets and bits of iron and steel a peculiar\r\nunseen force which can exert itself across space.\r\n\r\nThe power with which a magnet attracts or repels another magnet or\r\nattracts bits of iron and steel is called\r\n\r\n*Magnetic Force.* The force exerted by a magnet upon a bit of iron is\r\nnot the same at all distances. The force is stronger when the magnet is\r\nnear the iron and weaker when it is farther away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.—The Lifting Power of a Bar Magnet. _It must be\r\nbrought closer to the nails than the tacks because they are heavier_.]\r\n\r\nPlace some small carpet-tacks on a piece of paper and hold a magnet\r\nabove them. Gradually lower the magnet until the tacks jump up to meet\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThen try some nails in place of the tacks. The nails are heavier than\r\nthe tacks, and it will require a greater force to lift them. The magnet\r\nwill have to be brought much closer to the nails than to the tacks\r\nbefore they are lifted, showing that the force exerted by the magnet is\r\nstrongest nearest to it.\r\n\r\nMagnetize a needle and lay it on a piece of cork floating in a glass\r\nvessel of water. It will then be seen that the needle always comes to\r\nrest lying nearly in a north and south line, with the same end always\r\ntoward the north.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.—A Simple Compass.]\r\n\r\nThe pole of the magnet which tends to turn towards the north is called\r\nthe _north-seeking pole_ and the opposite one is called the\r\n_south-seeking pole_.\r\n\r\nThe name is usually abbreviated to simply the north and south poles. The\r\nnorth pole of a magnet is often indicated by a straight line or a letter\r\nN stamped into the metal.\r\n\r\nA magnetized needle floating on a cork in a basin of water is a simple\r\nform of\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.—Several Different Methods of Making a Simple\r\nCompass.]\r\n\r\n*Compass.* Figure 7 shows several other different ways of making\r\ncompasses. The first method is to suspend a magnetized needle from a\r\nfine silk fiber or thread.\r\n\r\nThe second method illustrates a very sensitive compass made from paper.\r\nTwo magnetized needles are stuck through the sides with their north\r\npoles both at the same end. The paper support is mounted upon a third\r\nneedle stuck through a cork.\r\n\r\nA compass which more nearly approaches the familiar type known as a\r\npocket compass may be made from a small piece of watch-spring or\r\nclock-spring.\r\n\r\nThe center of the needle is annealed or softened by holding it in the\r\nflame of an alcohol lamp and then allowing it to cool.\r\n\r\nLay the needle on a piece of soft metal such as copper or brass, and\r\ndent it in the center with a punch.\r\n\r\nBalance the needle on the end of a pin stuck through the bottom of a\r\npill-box.\r\n\r\n*Magnetic Substances* are those which are attracted by a magnet.\r\nExperiment with a number of different materials, such as paper, wood,\r\nbrass, iron, copper, zinc, rubber, steel, chalk, etc. It will be found\r\nthat only iron and steel are capable of being attracted by your magnet.\r\nOrdinary magnets attract but very few substances. Iron, steel, cobalt,\r\nand nickel are about the only ones worthy of mention.\r\n\r\n*Attraction through Bodies.* A magnet will attract a nail or a tack\r\nthrough a piece of paper, just as if nothing intervened.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.—The Attraction of an Iron Nail through _Glass_.]\r\n\r\nIt will also attract through glass, wood, brass, and all other\r\nsubstances. Through an iron plate, however, the attraction is reduced or\r\nentirely checked because the iron takes up the magnetic effect itself\r\nand prevents the force from passing through and reaching the nail.\r\n\r\nA number of carpet-tacks may be supported from a magnet in the form of a\r\nchain. Each individual tack in the series becomes a _temporary_ magnet\r\nby _induction_.\r\n\r\nIf the tack in contact with the magnet be taken in the hand and the\r\nmagnet suddenly withdrawn, the tacks will at once lose their magnetism\r\nand fall apart.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.—A Magnetic Chain.]\r\n\r\nIt will furthermore be found that a certain magnet will support a\r\ncertain number of tacks in the form of a chain, but that if a _second_\r\nmagnet is placed beneath the chain, so that its south pole is under the\r\nnorth pole of the original magnet, the chain may be lengthened by the\r\naddition of several other tacks.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this is that the magnetism in the tacks is increased by\r\ninduction.\r\n\r\n*Magnets will Attract or Repel* each other, depending upon which poles\r\nare nearest.\r\n\r\nMagnetize a sewing-needle and hang it from a thread. Bring the north\r\npole of a bar magnet near the lower end of the needle. If the lower end\r\nof the needle happens to be a south pole it will be attracted by the\r\nnorth pole of the bar magnet. If, on the other hand, it is a north pole,\r\nit will be repelled and you cannot touch it with the north pole of the\r\nbar magnet unless you catch it and hold it.\r\n\r\nThis fact gives rise to the general law of magnetism: _Like poles repel\r\neach other and unlike poles attract each other._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.—An Experiment Illustrating that Like Poles Repel\r\nEach Other and Unlike Poles Attract.]\r\n\r\nAnother interesting way of illustrating this same law is by making a\r\nsmall boat from cigar-box wood and laying a bar magnet on it. Place the\r\nnorth pole of the bar magnet in the bow of the boat.\r\n\r\nFloat the boat in a basin of water. Bring the south pole of a second\r\nmagnet near the stern of the boat and it will sail away to the opposite\r\nside of the basin. Present the north pole of the magnet and it will sail\r\nback again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.—A Magnetic Boat.]\r\n\r\nIf the south pole of the magnet is presented to the bow of the boat the\r\nlittle ship will follow the magnet all around the basin.\r\n\r\nThe repulsion of similar poles may be also illustrated by a number of\r\nmagnetized sewing-needles fixed in small corks so that they will float\r\nin a basin of water with their points down.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.—Repulsion between Similar Poles, Shown by\r\nFloating Needles.]\r\n\r\nThe needles will then arrange themselves in different symmetrical\r\ngroups, according to their number.\r\n\r\nA bar magnet thrust among them will attract or repel them depending upon\r\nits polarity.\r\n\r\nThe upper ends of the needles should all have the same polarity, that\r\nis, all be either north or south poles.\r\n\r\nMagnetism flows along certain lines called\r\n\r\n*Lines of Magnetic Force.* These lines always form closed paths or\r\ncircuits. The region in the neighborhood of a magnet through which these\r\nlines are passing is called the _field of force_, and the path through\r\nwhich they flow is called the\r\n\r\n*Magnetic Circuit.* The paths of the lines of force can be easily\r\ndemonstrated by placing a piece of paper over a bar magnet and then\r\nsprinkling iron filings over the paper, which should be jarred slightly\r\nin order that the filings may be drawn into the magnetic paths.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.—A Magnetic \"Phantom,\" Showing the Field of Force\r\nabout a Magnet.]\r\n\r\nThe filings will arrange themselves in curved lines, diverging from one\r\npole of the magnet and meeting again at the opposite pole. The lines of\r\nforce are considered as extending outward from the north pole of the\r\nmagnet, curving around through the air to the south pole and completing\r\nthe circuit back through the magnet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.—Magnetic Phantom showing the Lines of Force\r\nabout a Horseshoe Magnet.]\r\n\r\nFigure 14 shows the lines of force about a horseshoe magnet. It will be\r\nnoticed that the lines cross directly between the north and south poles.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the magnetic fields produced by like and unlike\r\npoles is shown in Figure 15.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.—Lines of Force between Like and Unlike Poles.]\r\n\r\nA study of this illustration will greatly assist the mind in conceiving\r\nhow attraction and repulsion of magnetic poles take place.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed the lines of force between two north poles resist\r\neach other and meet abruptly at the center. The lines between a north\r\nand a south pole pass in regular curves.\r\n\r\n*The Earth is a Great Magnet.* The direction assumed by a compass needle\r\nis called the _magnetic meridian_.\r\n\r\nThe action of the earth on a compass needle is exactly the same as that\r\nof a permanent magnet. The fact that a magnetized needle places itself\r\nin the magnetic meridian is because the earth is a great magnet with\r\nlines of force passing in a north and south direction.\r\n\r\nThe compass needle does not generally point exactly toward the true\r\nNorth. This is because the magnetic pole of the earth toward which the\r\nneedle points is not situated at the same place as the geographical\r\npole.\r\n\r\n*Magnetic Dip.* If a sewing-needle is balanced so as to be perfectly\r\nhorizontal when suspended from a silk thread and is then magnetized, it\r\nwill be found that it has lost its balance and that the _north_ end\r\npoints slightly downward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16.—A Simple Dipping Needle.]\r\n\r\nThis is due to the fact that the earth is round and that the magnetic\r\npole which is situated in the far North is therefore not on a horizontal\r\nline with the compass, but below such a line.\r\n\r\nA magnetic needle mounted so as to move freely in a vertical plane, and\r\nprovided with a scale for measuring the inclination, is called a\r\n\r\n*Dipping Needle.* A dipping needle may be easily made by thrusting a\r\nknitting-needle through a cork before it has been magnetized.\r\n\r\nA second needle is thrust through at right angles to the first and the\r\narrangement carefully balanced, so that it will remain horizontal when\r\nresting on the edge of two glasses.\r\n\r\nThen magnetize the first needle by stroking it with a bar magnet. When\r\nit is again rested on the glasses it will be found that the needle no\r\nlonger balances, but dips downward.\r\n\r\n*Permanent Magnets* have a number of useful applications in the\r\nconstruction of scientific instruments, voltmeters, ammeters, telephone\r\nreceivers, magnetos and a number of other devices.\r\n\r\nIn order to secure a very powerful magnet for some purposes a number of\r\nsteel bars are magnetized separately, and then riveted together. A\r\nmagnet made in this way is called a compound magnet, and may have either\r\na bar or a horse-shoe shape.\r\n\r\nMagnets are usually provided with a soft piece of iron called an\r\narmature or \"keeper.\" The \"keeper\" is laid across the poles of the\r\nmagnet when the latter is not in use and preserves its magnetism.\r\n\r\nA blow or a fall will disturb the magnetic arrangement of the molecules\r\nof a magnet and greatly weaken it. The most powerful magnet becomes\r\nabsolutely demagnetized at a red heat, and remains so after cooling.\r\n\r\nTherefore if you wish to preserve the strength of a magnetic appliance\r\nor the efficiency of any electrical instrument provided with a magnet,\r\ndo not allow it to receive rough usage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II STATIC ELECTRICITY\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you take a glass rod and rub it with a piece of flannel or silk, it\r\nwill be found to have acquired a property which it did not formerly\r\npossess: namely, the power of attracting to itself such light bodies as\r\ndust or bits of thread and paper.\r\n\r\nHold such a rod over some small bits of paper and watch them jump up to\r\nmeet it, just as if the glass rod were a magnet attracting small pieces\r\nof iron instead of paper.\r\n\r\nThe agency at work to produce this mysterious power is called\r\n_electricity_, from the Greek word \"Elektron,\" which means _amber_.\r\nAmber was the first substance found to possess this property.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17.—An Electrified Glass Rod will Attract Small Bits\r\nof Paper.]\r\n\r\nThe use of amber begins with the dawn of civilization. Amber beads have\r\nbeen found in the royal tombs at Mycenae and at various places\r\nthroughout Sardinia, dating from at least two thousand years before our\r\nera.\r\n\r\nAmber was used by the ancient world as a jewel and for decoration.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Syrian woman used distaffs made of amber for spinning. As\r\nthe spindle whirled around it often rubbed against the spinner’s\r\ngarments and thus became _electrified_, as amber always does when it is\r\nrubbed. Then on nearing the ground it drew to itself the dust or bits of\r\nchaff or leaves lying there, or sometimes perhaps attracted the fringe\r\nof the clothing.\r\n\r\nThe spinner easily saw this, because the bits of chaff which were thus\r\nattracted would become entangled in her thread unless she were careful.\r\nThe amber spindle was, therefore, called the \"harpaga\" or \"clutcher,\"\r\nfor it seemed to seize such light bodies as if it had invisible talons,\r\nwhich not only grasped but held on.\r\n\r\nThis was probably the first intelligent observation of an electrical\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nIn the eighteenth century, when Benjamin Franklin performed his famous\r\nkite experiment, electricity was believed to be a sort of fiery\r\natmospheric discharge which could be captured in small quantities and\r\nstored in receptacles such as Leyden jars.\r\n\r\nFranklin was the first to prove that the lightning discharges taking\r\nplace in the heavens are electrical.\r\n\r\nThe story of his experiment is very interesting.\r\n\r\nHe secured two light strips of cedar wood, placed cross-wise and covered\r\nwith a silk handkerchief for a kite. To the top of the upright stick of\r\nthe kite was fastened a sharp wire about a foot long. The twine was of\r\nthe usual kind, but was provided with a short piece of silk ribbon and a\r\nkey. The purpose of the ribbon was possible protection against the\r\nlightning running through his body, silk being a \"non-conductor,\" as\r\nwill be explained a little farther on. The key was secured to the\r\njunction of the silk ribbon and the twine, to serve as a convenient\r\nconductor from which to draw the sparks—if they came. He did not have to\r\nwait long for a thunderstorm, and as he saw it gathering he went out\r\nwith his son, then a young man twenty-two years of age. The great clouds\r\nrolled up from the horizon, and the gusts of wind grew fitful and\r\nstrong. The kite felt a swishing blast and began to rise steadily,\r\nswooping this way and that as the breeze caught it. The thunder muttered\r\nnearer and nearer and the rain began to patter on the grass as the kite\r\nflew higher.\r\n\r\nThe rain soon began to fall heavily, compelling Franklin and his son to\r\ntake refuge under a near-by shed. The heavy kite, wet with water, was\r\nsailing sluggishly when suddenly a huge low-lying black cloud traveling\r\noverhead shot forth a forked flame and the flash of thunder shook the\r\nvery earth. The kite moved upward, soaring straight into the black mass,\r\nfrom which the flashes began to come rapidly.\r\n\r\nFranklin watched the silk ribbon and the key. There was not a sign. Had\r\nhe failed? Suddenly the loose fibers of the twine erected themselves.\r\nThe moment had come. Without a tremor he advanced his knuckle to the\r\nkey. And between his knuckle and the key passed a spark! then another\r\nand another. They were the same kind of little sparks that he had made\r\nhundreds of times with a _glass tube._\r\n\r\nAnd then as the storm abated and the clouds swept off towards the\r\nmountains and the kite flew lazily in the blue, the face of Franklin\r\ngleamed in the glad sunshine. The great discovery was complete, his name\r\nimmortal.\r\n\r\nThe cause of lightning is the accumulation of the electric charges in\r\nthe clouds, the electricity residing on the surface of the particles of\r\nwater in the cloud. These charges grow stronger as the particles of\r\nwater join together and become larger. As the countless multitude of\r\ndrops grows larger and larger the \"potential\" is increased, and the\r\ncloud soon becomes heavily charged.\r\n\r\nThrough the effects of a phenomenon called _induction,_ and which we\r\nhave already stumbled against in the experiment with the tacks and the\r\nmagnetic chain, the force exerted by the charge grows stronger because\r\nof a charge of the opposite kind on a neighboring cloud or some object\r\non the earth beneath. These charges continually strive to burst across\r\nthe intervening air.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the charge grows strong enough a vivid flash of lightning,\r\nwhich may be from one to ten miles long, takes place. The heated air in\r\nthe path of the lightning expands with great force; but immediately\r\nother air rushes in to fill the partial vacuum, thus producing the\r\nterrifying sounds called _thunder_.\r\n\r\nIn the eighteenth century, electricity was believed to be a sort of\r\nfiery atmospheric discharge, as has been said. Later it was discovered\r\nthat it seemed to flow like water through certain mediums, and so was\r\nthought to be a fluid. Modern scientists believe it to be simply a\r\nvibratory motion, either between adjacent particles or in the ether\r\nsurrounding those particles.\r\n\r\nIt was early discovered that electricity would travel through some\r\nmediums but not through others. These were termed respectively\r\n\"conductors\" and \"non-conductors\" or insulators. Metals such as silver,\r\ncopper, gold, and other substances like charcoal, water, etc., are good\r\nconductors. Glass, silk, wool, oils, wax, etc., are non-conductors or\r\ninsulators, while many other substances, like wood, marble, paper,\r\ncotton, etc., are partial conductors.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be two kinds of electricity, one called \"static\" and the\r\nother \"current\" electricity. The former is usually produced by friction\r\nwhile the latter is generated by batteries or dynamos.\r\n\r\nA very simple and well-known method of generating static electricity is\r\nby shuffling or sliding the feet over the carpet. The body will then\r\nbecome _charged_, and if the knuckles are presented to some metallic\r\nobject, such as a gas-jet or radiator, a stinging little spark will jump\r\nout to meet it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From the author’s \"Wireless Telegraphy and Telephony\" by\r\npermission._ *A Double Lightning Discharge from a Cloud to the Earth.*]\r\n\r\nThe electricity is produced by the friction of the feet sliding over the\r\ncarpet and causes the body to become electrified.\r\n\r\nWarm a piece of writing-paper, then lay it on a wooden table and rub it\r\nbriskly with the hand. It soon will become stuck to the table and will\r\nnot slide along as it did at first. If one corner is raised slightly it\r\nwill tend to jump right back. If the paper is lifted off the table it\r\nwill tend to cling to the hands and the clothing. If held near the face\r\nit will produce a tickling sensation. All these things happen because\r\nthe paper is electrified. It is drawn to the other objects because they\r\nare _neutral_, that is, do not possess an electrical charge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19.—A Piece of Dry Writing-Paper may be Electrified\r\nby Rubbing.]\r\n\r\nAll experiments with static electricity perform better in the winter\r\ntime, when it is cool and clear, than in the summer. The reason is that\r\nthe air in winter is drier than in summer. Summer air contains\r\nconsiderable moisture and water vapor. Water vapor is a _partial_\r\nconductor of electricity, and the surrounding air will therefore conduct\r\nthe static electricity away from your apparatus almost as fast as it can\r\nbe produced in the summer time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20.—A Surprise for the Cat.]\r\n\r\nSome day during the winter time, when it is cool and clear, and the cat\r\nis near a fire or a stove, stroke the cat rapidly with the hand. The fur\r\nwill stand up towards the hand and a faint crackling noise will be\r\nheard. The crackling is caused by small sparks passing between the cat\r\nand the hand. If the experiment is performed in a dark room, the sparks\r\nmay be plainly seen. If you present your knuckle to the cat’s nose a\r\nspark will jump to your knuckle and somewhat surprise the cat.\r\n\r\nIf the day is brisk and cool, so that everything outside is frozen and\r\ndry, try combing the hair with a rubber comb. Your hair will stand up\r\nall over your head instead of lying down flat, and the faint crackling\r\nnoise, showing that sparking is taking place as the comb passes through\r\nthe hair, will be plainly heard. The electricity is produced by the\r\nfriction between the hair and the comb.\r\n\r\nElectricity may be produced by friction between a number of substances.\r\nA hard rubber rod, a glass rod, a rubber comb or a stick of sealing-wax\r\nmay be very easily electrified by rubbing them briskly with a piece of\r\ndry, warm flannel.\r\n\r\n*Electroscopes* are devices for detecting the presence of static\r\nelectricity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21.—A Paper Electroscope.]\r\n\r\nA very simple form of electroscope may be made in much the same manner\r\nas the paper compass described in the last chapter. It may be cut out of\r\nwriting-paper and mounted on a pin stuck through a cork. If an\r\nelectrified rod is held near the electroscope it may be made to whirl\r\naround in the same manner as a compass needle when a bar magnet is\r\nbrought to it.\r\n\r\n*The Pith-Ball Electroscope* is a very simple device, in which a ball of\r\ncork or elder pith is hung by a fine silk thread from an insulated\r\nsupport. A suitable electroscope may be made from a glass bottle having\r\na piece of wire thrust into the cork to support the pith ball. When the\r\nelectrified rod is presented to the pith ball, it will fly out towards\r\nthe rod.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22.—A Pith-Ball Electroscope.]\r\n\r\nIf the pith ball is permitted to touch the glass rod, the latter will\r\ntransfer some of its electricity and charge the ball. Almost immediately\r\nthe pith ball will fly away from the glass rod, and no matter how near\r\nthe rod is brought, it will refuse to be touched again.\r\n\r\nThis action is much the same as that of the magnetized needle suspended\r\nfrom a thread when the similar pole of the magnet is presented to it.\r\n\r\nWhen the rod is first presented to the pith ball, the latter is neutral\r\nand does not possess an electrical charge. When the rod has touched the\r\nball, however, some of the electricity from the rod passes to the ball,\r\nand after this they will repel each other.\r\n\r\nThe reason is that the rod and the ball are _similarly_ charged and\r\n_similarly charged bodies will repel each other_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23.—A Double Pith-Ball Electroscope.]\r\n\r\nIf you are a good observer you might have noticed when experimenting\r\nwith an electrified rod and the small bits of paper, that some of the\r\nlittle papers were first attracted and flew upwards to the rod, but\r\nhaving once touched it, were quickly repelled.\r\n\r\nThe repulsion between two similarly electrified bodies may be shown by a\r\ndouble electroscope.\r\n\r\nA double electroscope is made by hanging two pith balls on two silk\r\nthreads from the same support.\r\n\r\nElectrify a glass rod and touch it to the pith balls. They will\r\nimmediately fly apart because they are electrified with the same kind of\r\nelectricity.\r\n\r\n*The Gold-leaf Electroscope* is one of the most sensitive means which\r\ncan be employed to detect small amounts of static electricity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24.—A Gold-Leaf Electroscope.]\r\n\r\nIt is a very simple instrument and is easily made in a short time. A\r\ncouple of narrow strips of the thinnest tissue paper, or, better still,\r\ntwo strips of gold leaf, are hung from a support in a wide-mouthed glass\r\nbottle which serves at once to insulate and protect the strips from\r\ndraughts of air.\r\n\r\nThe mouth of the jar is closed by a plug of paraffin wax, through the\r\ncenter of which passes a small glass tube. A stiff copper wire passes\r\nthrough the tube. The lower end of the wire is bent at right angles to\r\nfurnish support for the strips of gold leaf. A round sheet metal disk\r\nabout the size of a quarter is soldered to the upper end of the rod.\r\n\r\nIf an electrified stick of sealing-wax or a glass rod is presented to\r\nthe disk of the electroscope, the strips will repel each other very\r\nstrongly. If the instrument is sensitive, the strips should begin to\r\ndiverge some time before the rod reaches the disk. It is possible to\r\nmake an electroscope so sensitive that chips formed by sharpening a\r\npencil will cause the strips to diverge.\r\n\r\n*There are two kinds of static electricity.* Rub a glass rod with a\r\npiece of silk and then suspend it in a wire stirrup as shown in Figure\r\n25. Excite a second rod also with a piece of silk and bring it near one\r\nend of the suspended one. The suspended rod is _repelled_ and will swing\r\naway from the one held in the hand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 25.—Method of Suspending an Electrified Rod in a\r\nWire Stirrup.]\r\n\r\nNow rub a stick of _sealing-wax_ with a piece of _flannel_ until the\r\nsealing-wax is electrified. Then bring the stick of sealing-wax near the\r\nend of the suspended rod. The rod will be _attracted_ to the\r\nsealing-wax.\r\n\r\nIf you experiment further you will find that two sticks of sealing-wax\r\nwill repel each other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 26.—Similarly Electrified Bodies Repel Each Other.\r\nDissimilarly Electrified Ones Attract Each Other.]\r\n\r\nThis experiment indicates that there are two kinds of electrification:\r\none developed by rubbing glass with silk and the other developed by\r\nrubbing sealing-wax with flannel.\r\n\r\nIn the first instance, the glass rod is said to be _positively_\r\nelectrified, and in the latter case the sealing-wax is _negatively_\r\nelectrified.\r\n\r\nThe same law that applies to magnetism also holds true in the case of\r\nstatic electricity, and similarly electrified bodies will repel each\r\nother and dissimilar ones attract.\r\n\r\n*The Electrophorus* is an instrument devised by Volta in 1775 for the\r\npurpose of obtaining static electricity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 27.—The Electrophorous]\r\n\r\nIt is easily constructed and will furnish a source of electricity for\r\nquite a number of interesting experiments. An electrophorus consists of\r\ntwo parts, a round cake of resinous material cast in a metal dish or\r\npan, and a round metal disk which is provided with an insulating handle.\r\n\r\nTo make an electrophorus, first procure an old cake or pie tin, and fill\r\nit with bits of resin or sealing-wax. Place the pan in a warm spot upon\r\nthe stove where the resin will melt, taking care not to overheat or it\r\nwill spatter and possibly take fire. As the resin melts, add more until\r\nthe pan is nearly full. When all is melted, remove from the fire and set\r\nit away where it may cool and harden in the pan without being disturbed.\r\n\r\nCut a circular disk out of sheet tin, zinc, or copper, making the\r\ndiameter about two inches less than that of the pie pan. Solder a small\r\ncylinder of tin or sheet brass to the center of the disk to aid in\r\nsupporting the handle. The latter is a piece of glass tubing about\r\nthree-quarters of an inch in diameter and four or five inches long,\r\nplaced in the center of the cylinder and secured with molten\r\nsealing-wax.\r\n\r\nIn order to use the electrophorus the resinous cake must first be beaten\r\nor briskly rubbed with a piece of warm woolen cloth or flannel. Then\r\nplace the disk on the cake holding the insulating handle with the right\r\nhand. Touch the cover or the disk momentarily with the forefinger of the\r\nleft hand. After the finger is removed, raise the disk from the cake by\r\npicking it up with the glass insulating handle. The disk will now be\r\nfound heavily charged with positive electricity, and if the knuckles are\r\npresented to the edge, a spark will jump out to meet them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 28.—An Electric Frog-Pond.]\r\n\r\nThe cover may then be replaced, touched, and once more removed. It will\r\nyield any number of sparks, the resinous cake only needing to be\r\nrecharged by rubbing once in a long while.\r\n\r\n*An Electric Frog-Pond* may be experimented with by cutting out some\r\nsmall tissue-paper frogs. Moisten them a little and lay them on the\r\ncover of the electrophorus. Touch the electrophorus with the finger and\r\nthen raise it with the insulating handle. If the \"frogs\" are not too wet\r\nthey will jump from the cover upon the table as soon as the cover is\r\nraised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III STATIC ELECTRIC MACHINES\r\n\r\n\r\nA Cylinder Electric Machine\r\n\r\n\r\nThe electrophorus described in the last chapter is capable of furnishing\r\nsufficient electricity for many interesting experiments, but for the\r\npurpose of procuring larger supplies of electricity, a static electric\r\nmachine is necessary.\r\n\r\nAn electric machine is composed of two parts, one for producing the\r\nelectricity by the friction of two surfaces rubbing against each other,\r\nand the other an arrangement for collecting the electricity thus formed.\r\n\r\nThe earliest form of electric machine consisted of a ball of sulphur\r\nfixed upon a spindle which could be rotated by means of a crank. When\r\nthe dry hands were pressed against the sulphur by a person standing on a\r\ncake of resin, which insulated him, sparks could be drawn from his body.\r\n\r\nLater a leather cushion was substituted for the hands, and a glass\r\ncylinder for the ball of sulphur, so that the frictional electric\r\nmachine now consists of a cylinder or a disk of glass mounted upon a\r\nhorizontal axis capable of being turned by a handle. A leather cushion,\r\nstuffed with horsehair and covered with a powdered amalgam of zinc or\r\ntin, presses against one side of the cylinder. A \"prime\" conductor in\r\nthe shape of an elongated cylinder presents a row of fine metal spikes,\r\nlike the teeth of a rake, to the opposite side. A flap of silk attached\r\nto the leather cushion passes over the cylinder and covers the upper\r\nhalf.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 29.—Front View of a Cylinder Electric Machine.]\r\n\r\nWhen the handle of the machine is turned, the friction produced between\r\nthe leather cushion and the glass generates a supply of positive\r\nelectricity on the glass, which is collected, as the cylinder revolves,\r\nby the row of sharp points, and transferred to the prime conductor.\r\n\r\nThe first thing required in the construction of an electric machine is a\r\nlarge glass bottle having a capacity of from two to four quarts.\r\n\r\nThe insulating power of glass varies considerably. Common green glass\r\n(not white glass colored green by copper, but glass such as the\r\ntelegraph insulators are made from) generally insulates the best. Some\r\nsorts of white glass, the Bohemian especially, are good insulators, but\r\nthis quality will not usually be found in ordinary bottles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30.—Method of Finding the Center of a Circle.]\r\n\r\nSelect a smooth bottle which has no lettering embossed upon it, and\r\nstand it upon a piece of white paper. Trace on the paper a line around\r\nthe circumference of the bottle so that the circle thus formed is of the\r\nsame size as the bottom of the bottle. Lay a carpenter’s square on the\r\ncircle so that the point _C_ just touches the circumference. Draw a line\r\nfrom _A_ to _B_ where the sides of the square cut the circumference. The\r\npoint in the middle of this line is the center of the circle.\r\n\r\nPlace the paper on the bottom of the bottle so that the circle coincides\r\nwith the circumference, and mark the center of the bottle.\r\n\r\nThe bottle must now be drilled. This is accomplished with a small\r\nthree-cornered file, the end of which has been broken off so as to form\r\na ragged cutting edge. The file is set in a brace and used like an\r\nordinary drill. During the boring process the drill must be frequently\r\nlubricated with a mixture of gum camphor and turpentine. The drilling,\r\nwhich will require almost an hour before the glass is pierced, if the\r\nbottle is a thick one, should be performed slowly and carefully, so as\r\nto avoid all danger of cracking the glass. The hole, when finished,\r\nshould be from one-quarter to three-eighths of an inch in diameter.\r\n\r\nAfter the hole has been bored, fit a wooden plug into the neck of the\r\nbottle and cement it there with a mixture composed of one-half a pound\r\nof resin, five ounces of beeswax, one-quarter of an ounce of plaster of\r\nParis, and three-quarters of an ounce of red ocher, melted together over\r\na moderately warm stove. Dip the plug in the molten cement and force it\r\ninto the neck of the bottle. When the cement dries it will be impossible\r\nto remove it.\r\n\r\nThe sizes of bottles vary, so that it is quite impossible to give\r\ndimensions which must be closely followed in constructing the machine.\r\nThose in the text are approximate. The drawings have been made to scale\r\nso as to show the proportions the parts bear to each other.\r\n\r\nA heavy wooden base will be required to mount the machine on. Two\r\nuprights are mounted on the base to support the axis of the bottle.\r\nThrough one of these bore a hole of the same diameter as the wooden plug\r\nfitted in the neck of the bottle. The end of the wooden plug projecting\r\nthrough the upright is notched and fitted with a crank so that the\r\nbottle may be revolved. The handle of the crank is an ordinary spool\r\nhaving one flange cut off and mounted with a screw and a washer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 31.—The \"Rubber.\"]\r\n\r\nThe machine is now ready for the \"rubber\" and \"prime conductor.\" The\r\nrubber is a piece of wood one inch square and from six to eight inches\r\nlong. A piece of undressed leather is tacked on as shown in the\r\nillustration and stuffed with horsehair. The wood is shellacked and\r\ncovered with tin-foil previous to tacking on the leather. A strip of\r\nwood, two inches wide and one-half an inch thick, is fastened to the\r\nback of the rubber. The strip should be just long enough so that when\r\nthe lower end rests on the base the rubber is level with the axis of the\r\nbottle. The lower end may be fastened to the base by means of a small\r\nbrass hinge. Two rubber bands stretch from hooks between the rubber and\r\nthe base so as to pull the former tightly against the bottle. The\r\nillustration shows a method of mounting the rubber on a foot-piece held\r\nto the base with a thumb-nut so that it may be slid back and forth and\r\nthe pressure varied at will.\r\n\r\nThe prime conductor is formed from a piece of curtain-pole two inches in\r\ndiameter and eight inches long. The ends are rounded with a rasp and\r\nthen smoothed with sandpaper. The whole surface is then shellacked and\r\ncovered with a layer of tinfoil. The heads of a number of dressmaker’s\r\npins are cut off, and the pins forced into the side of the prime\r\nconductor with a pair of pincers. They should form a row like the teeth\r\nof a rake about three-eighths of an inch apart. A hole is bored in the\r\ncenter of the under side of the prime conductor to receive a glass rod\r\none-half inch in diameter. A second hole of the same size is bored in\r\nthe base in such a position that when the glass rod is in place, the\r\nteeth on the prime conductor are on a level with the axis of the bottle,\r\nand their points about 3-32 of an inch away from the glass. The glass\r\nrod must be used in order to insulate the prime conductor and prevent\r\nthe escape of the electricity. It is secured with some of the cement\r\ndescribed on page 33. A piece of water-gauge glass may be used in place\r\nof a glass rod.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 32.—The Prime Conductor or Collector.]\r\n\r\nA strip of oiled silk, or in its place a strip of silk which has been\r\nshellacked, eight or nine inches wide, and long enough to reach half-way\r\naround the bottle, is tacked to the rubber so that the silk covers the\r\nupper half of the cylinder and comes over to within one-quarter of an\r\ninch of the steel points.\r\n\r\nThe machine is now complete, and when the handle is turned rapidly, you\r\nwill be able to draw sparks from the prime conductor. The sparks will\r\nprobably be very short, about one-half of an inch long. These can be\r\nincreased, however, to three inches, if the glass is of the right\r\nquality, by treating the rubber with amalgam.\r\n\r\nThe amalgam is formed by melting one ounce of tin and adding to it one\r\nounce of zinc in small bits. As soon as the zinc has also melted add to\r\nthe mixture two ounces of mercury which has been previously warmed. Be\r\ncareful not to inhale any of the vapor during this operation. Pour the\r\nmixture into a vessel of cold water, which will reduce the metal to\r\nsmall grains. Pour off the water and grind the amalgam to a powder by\r\npounding the grains with a hammer.\r\n\r\nThe leather rubber should be _thinly_ smeared with lard and the powdered\r\namalgam rubbed on it.\r\n\r\nIn order to obtain the greatest effect from an electric machine, it must\r\nbe carefully freed from dust and particles of amalgam adhering to the\r\nglass, and the insulating column rubbed with a warm woolen cloth. The\r\nbest results are obtained by placing the machine near a stove or\r\nradiator where it is warm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 33.—The Complete Cylinder Electric Machine.]\r\n\r\n\r\nA Wimshurst Machine\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wimshurst Machine consists of two varnished glass plates revolving\r\nin opposite directions. On the outside of each of these plates are\r\ncemented a number of tinfoil \"sectors,\" arranged radially. Two\r\nconductors at right angles to each other extend obliquely across the\r\nplates, one at the back and the other at the front. These conductors\r\neach terminate in brushes of tinsel which electrically excite the\r\n\"sectors\" as the plates revolve. The electricity is collected by a set\r\nof \"collectors\" arranged in a somewhat similar manner to the collector\r\non the cylinder electric machine.\r\n\r\n*The Glass Plates* are each eighteen inches in diameter. Purchase two\r\npanes of clear glass twenty inches square from a glass dealer. The white\r\nglass is far preferable to the green glass and will make the best\r\nelectric machine. The plates should be of the thickness known as \"single\r\nlight\" and should be perfectly free from wavy places, bubbles, or other\r\nimperfections.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 34.—Paper Pattern for laying out the Plates.]\r\n\r\nThe work is first laid out on a piece of stiff paper twenty inches\r\nsquare as a pattern. Describe a circle four inches in diameter. Using\r\nthe same center, draw other circles, making them respectively eight,\r\nsixteen, and eighteen inches in diameter. Then mark sixteen radial\r\nlines, from the center, making them equal distances apart, as shown in\r\nFigure 34.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 35.—Plate with Sectors in Position, and a Pattern\r\nfor the Sectors.]\r\n\r\nLay one of the glass panes over the pattern and cut out a glass circle\r\neighteen inches in diameter, or perhaps you may be able to have a\r\nglazier do the cutting for you and so save considerable trouble and\r\npossible breakage. Two such plates should be made.\r\n\r\nThe Sectors are cut from heavy flat tinfoil according to the pattern\r\nshown in Figure 35. They should be made one inch and one-half wide at\r\nthe wide end and three-quarters of an inch at the other end. They are\r\neach four inches long. Thirty-two such sectors are required. The easiest\r\nway to make them is to cut out a pattern from heavy cardboard to serve\r\nas a guide.\r\n\r\nClean and dry both of the glass plates very carefully and then give them\r\neach two thin coats of white shellac. After they have been dried, lay\r\none of the plates on the paper pattern so that the outside of the plate\r\nwill coincide with the largest circle on the paper.\r\n\r\nThen place a weight in the center of the plate so that it will not move,\r\nand stick sixteen of the tinfoil sectors on the plate with thick\r\nshellac. The sectors are arranged symmetrically on the plate, using the\r\neight-inch and sixteen-inch circles and the radial lines as guides. Both\r\nplates should be treated in this manner. Each sector should be carefully\r\npressed down on the glass, so that it will stick smoothly without\r\nair-bubbles or creases. When all the sectors are in place the plates\r\nwill appear like that shown in Figure 35.\r\n\r\n*The Bosses* will have to be turned out at a wood-working mill or at\r\nsome place where they have a turning-lathe. The bosses are four inches\r\nin diameter at the large end and one inch and one-half at the other. A\r\ngroove is turned near the small end of each to accommodate a round\r\nleather belt.\r\n\r\nA hole should be made in each boss about half-way through from the small\r\nend. These holes should be bushed with a piece of brass tubing having an\r\ninside diameter of one-half inch. The tubing should go into the hole\r\nvery snugly and be a \"driven fit.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 36.—A Side View of one of the Bosses, showing the\r\nBrass Bushing used.]\r\n\r\nThe bosses should both be given a coat of shellac, and after this is\r\ndry, fastened to the glass plates on the same side to which the tinfoil\r\nsectors are attached. The best plan is to lay the disks on the paper\r\npattern and adjust them until the outer edge coincides with the largest\r\ncircle.\r\n\r\nThen apply some _bichromate glue_ to the flat surface of one of the\r\nbosses and place the latter in the center of the plate in line with the\r\nsmallest circle.\r\n\r\nPlace a weight on the boss to hold it down firmly against the plate and\r\nleave it over night, or for ten or twelve hours, until thoroughly dry.\r\n\r\nThe glue is prepared by placing some high-grade glue in a tin cup and\r\ncovering it with cold water. Allow it to stand until the glue absorbs\r\nall the water it will and becomes soft. Then pour the water off and add\r\nenough _glacial acetic acid_ to cover the glue.\r\n\r\nHeat the mixture until it is reduced to a liquid, stirring it until it\r\nis perfectly smooth. Add a teaspoonful of powdered bichromate of potash\r\nto the glue.\r\n\r\nThe glue must now be kept in the dark, for sunlight will \"set\" the glue\r\nso that it becomes insoluble.\r\n\r\nThe Frame of the machine is composed of two strips twenty-five inches\r\nlong, three inches wide, and an inch and one-half in thickness, and two\r\ncross-pieces of the same thickness and width fifteen inches long.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 37.—The Frame.]\r\n\r\nNotches are cut at both sides of the base to admit the feet of the\r\nuprights.\r\n\r\n*The Uprights* are seventeen inches long, three inches wide, and one and\r\none-half inches thick.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 38.—The Upright.]\r\n\r\nThe notch at the foot is cut the same width as the thickness of the long\r\nmembers of the frame and is arranged so that when fitted in place, the\r\nfoot of the upright will rest on the table in line with the bottom of\r\nthe cross-pieces.\r\n\r\n*The Driving-Wheels* are turned out of wood on a lathe. They are seven\r\ninches in diameter and seven-eighths of an inch thick. A groove should\r\nbe turned in the edge to carry a small round leather belt. The wheels\r\nare mounted on a wooden axle made from a round curtain-pole. They are\r\nglued to the axle and arranged so that the grooves will fall directly\r\nunderneath the pulleys turned in the bosses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 39.—The Driving-Wheels and Axle.]\r\n\r\nThe ends of the axle pass through the uprights, five inches above the\r\nbottom.\r\n\r\nThe front end of the axle is fitted with a crank and a handle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 40—The Boss and Axle. For sake of clearness, the\r\nPlate is not shown.]\r\n\r\nThe plates are mounted on short iron axles passing through the top of\r\nthe upright into the brass bushings. One end of each of the axles is\r\nfiled flat where it passes through the wood upright so that it may be\r\nfirmly held by a set-screw and prevented from revolving.\r\n\r\nFasten a small fiber washer to the center of one glass disk so that it\r\nwill separate the plates and prevent them from touching when revolving.\r\n\r\nThe collectors, quadrant rods, etc., are mounted on glass rods one inch\r\nin diameter. The bottoms of the rods fit in holes (_H H_) bored in the\r\ncross-pieces of the base, Figure 37. The upper ends are each fitted with\r\na brass ball two inches in diameter. The balls are mounted on the rods\r\nby soldering a piece of brass tubing to the ball and slipping it over\r\nthe rod. The rods should be of the proper length to bring the center of\r\nthe balls on a line with the center of the plates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 41—Showing how the Ball, Comb, etc., are mounted on\r\nthe Glass Rod.]\r\n\r\nMake two forks as shown in Figure 42 out of brass rod, three-sixteenths\r\nof an inch in diameter and solder brass balls at the ends. The forks are\r\neleven inches long.\r\n\r\nA number of small holes must be bored in the \"prongs\" and pins made by\r\ncutting ordinary dressmakers’ pins in half and soldering them in place.\r\nThese pins, mounted on the forks, form the combs or collectors.\r\n\r\nBore a horizontal hole through each of the brass rods on the top of the\r\nglass rods and pass the shanks of the forks through and solder them in\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nOne of the shanks may be provided with a discharge ball at the end as\r\nshown by _D B_ in Figure 44. The other is provided with a hard rubber\r\nhandle made from a piece of rod. Bore a three-eighths hole directly in\r\nthe top of each brass ball to receive the quadrant rods forming the\r\nspark-gap.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 42.—A Comb or Collector.]\r\n\r\nThe quadrant rods extend over the top of the plates and are\r\nthree-eighths of an inch in diameter. They are loose in the tops of the\r\nballs so that they may be moved about or removed entirely.\r\n\r\nA small brass ball three-quarters of an inch in diameter should be\r\nsoldered to the top of one of the quadrant rods and a similar ball two\r\ninches in diameter to the other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 43.—Showing how the Tinsel Brushes are arranged on\r\nthe \"Neutralizer\" Rods.]\r\n\r\nTwo large brass balls, two inches in diameter, are fitted over the ends\r\nof the axles, which project through the uprights. Bore a\r\none-quarter-inch hole through each ball at right angles to the axle and\r\nslip a one-quarter-inch brass rod through and solder it fast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 44.—The Complete Wimshurst Electric Machine.

For the sake of clearness, several of the sectors\r\nare not shown.]\r\n\r\nThe ends of the rods should be tipped with a bunch of tinsel or fine\r\ncopper wires and be curved so that the brushes so formed will just touch\r\nthe sectors on the disks when the latter are revolved.\r\n\r\nThese are the neutralizers and are arranged in the approximate positions\r\nshown in Figure 44.\r\n\r\nThe driving-wheels are connected to the bosses by means of small round\r\nleather belts. The belt at the rear of the machine is crossed in order\r\nto make the plates revolve in opposite directions.\r\n\r\nIf the machine has been properly built it is now ready for operation. It\r\nmay be necessary to charge the machine the first time that it is used by\r\ntouching several of the sectors with the charged cover of an\r\nelectrophorus. Then if the handle is turned the accumulated electricity\r\nshould discharge across the spark-gap at the top of the machine in the\r\nform of bright blue sparks.\r\n\r\n\r\nExperiments with an Electric Machine\r\n\r\n\r\nMany interesting experiments can be performed with an electric machine.\r\nThe number is almost unlimited. A few of the most instructive ones are\r\ndescribed below. Others can be found in almost any text book on physics.\r\n\r\n*The Leyden jar* consists of a glass jar coated with tinfoil part way up\r\non both the outside and inside. Through the wooden stopper passes a\r\nbrass rod or a heavy copper wire which connects with the inner coating\r\nof tinfoil by means of a small brass chain. The upper and outside end of\r\nthe rod usually terminates in a brass ball or knob.\r\n\r\nIt is a very simple matter to make a good Leyden jar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 45.—The Leyden Jar.]\r\n\r\nThe jar must be thoroughly cleaned and dried before coating. The inside\r\nis then given a thorough brushing over with shellac or varnish. Before\r\nit is dry, carefully insert the tin-foil and press it smoothly against\r\nthe glass. The outside of the jar is treated and coated in the same\r\nmanner. The inside and outside of the bottom are also coated by cutting\r\nthe tinfoil in circular pieces and shellacking them on.\r\n\r\nIn order to charge the Leyden jar, grasp it in the hand near the bottom\r\nand hold the knob against the prime conductor while turning the handle\r\nof the machine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 46.—A Wooden Mortar for Igniting Gunpowder.]\r\n\r\n*Igniting gunpowder.* Bore a hole one-half inch in diameter and one inch\r\ndeep in a block of hardwood. Pass two small brass wires through holes in\r\nthe sides, letting the ends of the wires be about one-eighth of an inch\r\napart. Pour a little gunpowder in loosely over the wires. Tie a piece of\r\nthoroughly moistened cotton twine, three inches long, to one of the\r\nwires and attach it to the outside coating of a charged Leyden jar.\r\n\r\nConnect the knob of the jar to the other wire. The gunpowder will\r\nimmediately explode. Keep the face and hands away from the gunpowder\r\nwhen performing this experiment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 47.—An Electric Umbrella.]\r\n\r\n*Electric Umbrella.* The repulsion of similarly electrified bodies which\r\nwas illustrated by the action of the pith ball electroscope may be\r\nbetter illustrated by pasting some narrow streamers of tissue paper\r\nabout one-eighth of an inch wide and four inches long to a small cork\r\ncovered with tinfoil. The cork is mounted on the upper end of a stiff\r\ncopper wire supported in a bottle. When the wire is connected to the\r\nprime conductor and the machine set in motion, the strips will spread\r\nout like an umbrella.\r\n\r\n*Lightning Board.* A pane of glass is thoroughly cleaned and then given\r\na coat of shellac or varnish. Before the varnish is dry, press on a\r\npiece of tinfoil large enough to cover one side of the glass and rub it\r\ndown smoothly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 48.—A Lightning Board.]\r\n\r\nAfter the shellac or varnish is dry, cut the tinfoil up into innumerable\r\nlittle squares with a sharp knife and ruler, leaving two solid strips of\r\ntinfoil at the ends of the glass pane.\r\n\r\nThe pane is mounted by cementing it in a slot in the cork of a bottle.\r\nConnect one of the tinfoil strips to the prime conductor and the other\r\nto the earth or the body. When the machine is turned, innumerable little\r\nsparks will pass between the tinfoil squares and give an appearance very\r\nsimilar to that of lightning.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 49.—An Electric Dance.]\r\n\r\n*The Electrical Dance.* A number of little balls of cork or pith are\r\nenclosed in a cylinder of glass about two and one-half or three inches\r\nhigh formed by cutting off the top of a lamp chimney. The top and bottom\r\nof the cylinder are closed by two circular pieces of sheet brass or\r\ncopper. The top disk is connected to the prime conductor while the\r\nbottom one is connected to the rubber. When the machine is set in\r\nmotion, the little balls will dance up and down. Bits of feather or\r\npaper cut to represent figures of men and women may be used as well as\r\npith or cork balls.\r\n\r\n*The Electric Whirl.* The whirl consists of an S shaped piece of brass\r\nwire, pointed at both ends and supported on a needle by a little conical\r\ndepression made in the center with a punch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 50.—An Electric Whirl.]\r\n\r\nThe needle is stuck in a cork in the top of a bottle and connected with\r\nthe prime conductor of the electric machine. When the latter is set in\r\nmotion, the whirl will commence to revolve at a high rate of speed.\r\n\r\n*Lichtenberg’s Figures* can be produced by charging a Leyden jar by\r\nconnecting the knob or inside coating with the prime conductor and\r\nholding the outside coating in the hand.\r\n\r\nThen trace a small circle on the electrophorus bed with the knob.\r\n\r\nCharge a second Leyden jar by connecting the outside coating with the\r\nprime conductor.\r\n\r\nThe inside coating should be connected to the rubber by means of a wire\r\nfastened to the knob. The same result may be obtained by connecting the\r\noutside coating with the prime conductor and touching the knob with the\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nThen trace a cross on the electrophorus bed with the knob, making the\r\ncross inside of the circle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 51.—Lichtenberg’s Figures.]\r\n\r\nShake a mixture of red lead and sulphur through a muslin bag from a\r\nheight of several inches over the electrophorus.\r\n\r\nThe red lead will accumulate around the cross and the sulphur around the\r\ncircle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV CELLS AND BATTERIES\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order that the young experimenter may obtain electricity for driving\r\nhis various electrical devices it is necessary to resort to batteries, a\r\nsmall dynamo, or the house-lighting current.\r\n\r\nAll houses are not supplied with electric current. Furthermore, many\r\nboys have no source of power from which to drive a small dynamo.\r\nBatteries must therefore be resorted to in the majority of cases.\r\n\r\nA number of different cells and batteries are described in this chapter.\r\nAll of them are practical, but after buying zinc, chemicals, etc., for\r\nany length of time, figure out what your batteries _cost_ you to make.\r\nThe real value is not their cost in dollars and cents but in what you\r\nhave _learned_ in making them. If you have a continuous use for\r\nelectrical current for running _small_ electrical devices it is cheaper\r\nto buy dry cells, or what is better, a _storage battery_, and have it\r\n_recharged_ when necessary.\r\n\r\n_Build your own batteries first_. Then after you have learned how they\r\nare made and something about their proper care buy them from some\r\nreliable electrical house.\r\n\r\nBatteries are always interesting to the average experimenter, and when\r\nproperly made are one of the most useful pieces of apparatus around the\r\nhome, laboratory, or shop that it is possible to construct. Many\r\nhundreds of thousands of experiments have been carried out by capable\r\nmen in an effort to discover or devise a perfect battery, and the list\r\nof such cells is very great.\r\n\r\nOnly the most common forms, which are simple and inexpensive to\r\nconstruct but will at the same time render fair service, have been\r\nchosen for description.\r\n\r\nCells are usually considered _one_ element or jar of a battery. A _cell_\r\nmeans only one, while a _battery_ is a _group_ of cells. It is not a\r\nproper use of the word to say \"battery\" when only _one_ cell is implied.\r\nThis is a very common error.\r\n\r\n*The Voltaic cell* is called after its inventor, Volta, a professor in\r\nthe University of Pavia, and dates back to about the year 1786.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 52.—The Voltaic Cell.]\r\n\r\nA simple voltaic cell is easily made by placing some water mixed with a\r\nlittle sulphuric acid in a glass tumbler and immersing therein two clean\r\nstrips, one of zinc and the other of copper. The strips must be kept\r\nseparate from each other. The sulphuric acid must be diluted by mixing\r\nit with about ten times its volume of water. In mixing acid with water\r\nalways remember never to pour water into acid but to perform the\r\noperation the other way and pour the acid into the water. A copper wire\r\nis fastened with a screw or by soldering to the top of each of the\r\nstrips, and care must be exercised to keep the wires apart.\r\n\r\nAs has been said, the zinc and copper must never be allowed to touch\r\neach other in the solution, but must be kept at opposite sides of the\r\njar.\r\n\r\nThe sulphuric acid solution attacks the zinc, causing it slowly to waste\r\naway and disappear. This action is called _oxidation_, and in reality is\r\na very slow process of burning. The consumption of the zinc furnishes\r\nthe electric energy, which in the case of this cell will be found to be\r\nsufficient to ring a bell or buzzer, or run a very small toy motor.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the plates are immersed in the acid solution, bubbles will\r\nbegin to rise from the zinc. These bubbles contain a gas called hydrogen\r\nand they indicate that a chemical action is taking place. The zinc is\r\nbeing dissolved and the _hydrogen_ gas is being set free from the acid.\r\nIt will be noticed that no bubbles arise from the copper plate and that\r\nthere is little if any chemical action there. In other words, it seems\r\nthat the chemical action at one plate is stronger than that at the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nA cell might be likened to a furnace in which the zinc is the fuel which\r\nis burned to furnish the energy. We know that if the zinc is burned or\r\noxidized in the open air it will give out energy in the form of _heat_.\r\nWhen it is burned or oxidized slowly in acid in the presence of another\r\nmetal it gives out its energy in the form of _electricity_. The acid\r\nmight be likened to the fire, and the copper to a hand which dips into\r\nthe cell to pick up the current and takes no part chemically.\r\n\r\nIf a wire is connected to each of the plates and the free ends of the\r\nwires touched to the tip of the tongue it will produce a peculiar salty\r\ntaste in the mouth indicating the presence of a current of electricity.\r\n\r\nIf the wires are connected to an electric bell, the bell will ring, or,\r\ninstead, the current may be used to run a small motor. If the cell is\r\nmade of two zinc plates or two copper plates, the bell will not ring,\r\nbecause no electricity will be produced. In order to produce a current,\r\nthe electrodes must be made of two different materials upon which the\r\nacid acts differently. Current may be obtained from a cell made with a\r\nzinc and carbon plate or from one with zinc and iron.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in order to make a battery it is necessary to have a metal\r\nwhich may be consumed, a chemical to consume or oxidize it, and an\r\ninactive element which is merely present to collect the electricity.\r\n\r\nWhen the wires connected to the two plates are joined together, a\r\ncurrent of electricity will flow from the copper plate through the wire\r\nto the zinc. The copper is known as the _positive_ pole and the zinc as\r\nthe _negative_.\r\n\r\nA simple voltaic cell may be easily made by cutting out a strip of zinc\r\nand a strip of copper, each 3 1/2 inches long, and one inch wide. A\r\nsmall hole bored through the upper end of the strips will permit them to\r\nbe mounted on a wooden strip with a screw as shown in Figure 53. The\r\nconnecting wires are placed under the heads of the screws. Care should\r\nbe exercised to arrange the screws used for mounting the electrodes to\r\nthe wooden strip so that they do not come exactly opposite, and there is\r\nno danger of the points touching and forming a short circuit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 53.—The Elements of Simple Voltaic Cell.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 54.—A Home-Made Voltaic Cell.]\r\n\r\nAn ordinary tumbler or jelly glass will make a good battery jar. The\r\nexciting liquid should be composed of\r\n\r\nOne part of sulphuric acid\r\nTen parts of water\r\n\r\nOne of the disadvantages of the voltaic cell is that it becomes\r\n_polarized_, that is, small bubbles of hydrogen which are liberated by\r\nthe chemical action collect on the copper plate and cause the strength\r\nof the battery to fall off rapidly.\r\n\r\nThere are a great number of _elements_, as the zinc and copper are\r\ncalled, and an even greater number of different solutions or _excitants_\r\nwhich can be employed in place of sulphuric acid to make a cell, forming\r\nan almost endless number of possible combinations.\r\n\r\n*Leclanche Cell.* One of the most common forms of cell employed for\r\nbell-ringing, telephones, etc., is called the Leclanche cell, after its\r\ninventor, and consists of two elements, one of zinc and the other of\r\ncarbon, immersed in a solution of _sal ammoniac_ or _ammonium chloride_.\r\nThis cell has an E. M. F. of 1.4 volts, which is about half as much\r\nagain as the voltaic cell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 55.—Carbon-Cylinder Cell, and Cylinder.]\r\n\r\nThe most common form of Leclanche cell is illustrated in Figure 55. This\r\ntype is usually known as a \"carbon cylinder\" cell because the positive\r\nelement is a hollow carbon cylinder. The zinc is in the form of a rod\r\npassing through a porcelain bushing set in the center of the carbon\r\ncylinder. A battery of such cells can only be used successfully for open\r\ncircuit work. The \"open circuit\" is used for bells, burglar alarms,\r\ntelephone circuits, etc., or wherever the circuit is such that it is\r\n\"open\" most of the time and current is only drawn occasionally and then\r\nonly for short periods.\r\n\r\nIf the current is drawn for any appreciable length of time hydrogen gas\r\nwill collect on the carbon cylinder and the cell will become\r\n_polarized_. When polarized it will not deliver much current.\r\n\r\nMany methods have been devised for overcoming this difficulty, but even\r\nthe best of them are only partially successful.\r\n\r\nThe usual method is to employ a chemical _depolarizing_ agent. Figure 56\r\nshows a Leclanche cell provided with a _depolarizer_.\r\n\r\nThe carbon is in the form of a plate placed in a _porous cup_ made of\r\nearthenware and filled with _manganese dioxide_.\r\n\r\nChemists class _manganese dioxide_ as an _oxidizing_ agent, which means\r\nthat it will furnish oxygen with comparative ease. Oxygen and hydrogen\r\nhave a strong _chemical affinity_ or attraction for each other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 56.—A Leclanche Cell, showing the Porous Cup.]\r\n\r\nIf the carbon plate is packed in manganese dioxide any hydrogen which\r\ntends to collect on the carbon and polarize the cell is immediately\r\n_seized_ by the oxygen of the manganese dioxide and united with it to\r\nform water.\r\n\r\nThis form of Leclanche cell is called the disk type. It is capable of\r\ndelivering a stronger current for a longer period of time than the\r\ncarbon cylinder battery. The zinc is usually made in the form of a\r\ncylinder, and fits around the outside of the porous cup.\r\n\r\n*Dry Cells* are used extensively nowadays for all open circuit work on\r\naccount of their convenience and high efficiency.\r\n\r\nThe dry cell is not, as its name implies, \"dry,\" but the exciting agent\r\nor electrolyte, instead of being a liquid, is a wet paste which cannot\r\nspill or run over. The top of the cell is poured full of molten pitch,\r\nthus effectively sealing it and making it possible to place the cell in\r\nany position.\r\n\r\nDry cells can be purchased from almost any electrical house or garage\r\nfor twenty-five cents each. It will therefore hardly pay the young\r\nexperimenter to make his own _dry cells_. For the sake of those who may\r\ncare to do so, however, directions for building a simple but efficient\r\ndry cell of the type used for door-bells and ignition work, will be\r\nfound below.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 57.—A Dry Cell.]\r\n\r\nThe principle of a dry cell is the same as that of a Leclanche cell of\r\nthe disk type. The exciting solution is _ammonium chloride_, the\r\nelectrodes or elements are zinc and carbon, and the carbon is surrounded\r\nby manganese dioxide as a depolarizing agent.\r\n\r\nObtain some sheet zinc from a plumbing shop or a hardware store and cut\r\nout as many rectangles, 8 x 6 inches, as it is desired to make cells.\r\nAlso cut out an equal number of circles 2 3/8 inches in diameter.\r\n\r\nRoll the sheets up into cylinders 2 3/8 inches in diameter inside and 6\r\ninches long. The edges are lapped and soldered. Fit one of the round\r\ncircles in one end of each of the cylinders and solder them securely\r\ninto place, taking care to close up all seams or joints which might\r\npermit the electrolyte to escape or evaporate.\r\n\r\nSecure some old carbon rods or plates by breaking open some old dry\r\ncells. The carbons will be in the form of a flat plate, a round rod, or\r\na star-shaped corrugated rod, depending upon the manufacture of the\r\ncell. Any of these types of carbons will serve the purpose well,\r\nprovided that they are fitted with a thumb-screw or a small bolt and nut\r\nat the top so as to make wire connections with the carbon.\r\n\r\nMake a wooden plunger of the same shape as the carbon which you may\r\nselect, but make it slightly larger. Smooth it with sandpaper and give\r\nit a coat of shellac to prevent it from absorbing moisture.\r\n\r\nThis wooden plunger is temporarily inserted in the center of one of the\r\nzinc cups and supported so that it will be about one-half inch above the\r\nbottom.\r\n\r\nThe electrolyte is prepared by mixing together the following ingredients\r\nin the proportions shown:\r\n\r\nSal Ammoniac. 1 part\r\nZinc Chloride. 1 part\r\nPlaster of Paris. 3 parts\r\nFlour. 3/4 part\r\nWater. 2 parts\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 58.—The Different Operations involved in Making a\r\nDry Cell.]\r\n\r\nThe above paste is then firmly packed into the zinc shell around the\r\nwooden plunger, leaving a space of about 3/4 of an inch at the top. The\r\npaste can be poured in very readily when first mixed but sets and\r\nhardens after standing a short while.\r\n\r\nAfter it has set, withdraw the wooden plunger, thus leaving a space\r\ninside of the dry cell a little larger than the carbon. The carbon is\r\nnow inserted in this hole and the surrounding space is filled with a\r\nmixture composed of:\r\n\r\nSal Ammoniac. 1 part\r\nZinc Chloride. 1 part\r\nManganese Dioxide. 1 part\r\nGranulated Carbon. 1 part\r\nFlour. 1 part\r\nPlaster of Paris. 3 parts\r\nWater. 2 parts\r\n\r\nThe granular carbon may be had by crushing up some old battery carbons.\r\nThe parts given in both of the above formulas are proportioned so that\r\nthey may be measured by bulk and not by weight. An old teaspoon or a\r\nsmall cup will make a good measure.\r\n\r\nEach one of the zinc shells should be filled in this manner. After they\r\nhave all been filled, clean off the top edge of the zinc and pour the\r\nremaining space in the cell full of molten tar or pitch so as to seal it\r\nover.\r\n\r\nSolder a small binding-post to the top edge of the zinc to facilitate\r\nconnection. Then wrap the cells in several thicknesses of heavy paper to\r\nprevent them from short circuiting, and they are ready for use.\r\n\r\nA small hole bored through the sealing material after it is dry will\r\nprovide a vent for the escape of gases.\r\n\r\n*Recharging dry cells* is a subject that interests most experimenters.\r\n\r\nDry cells very often become useless before the zinc shell is used up or\r\nthe chemicals are exhausted, due to the fact that the water inside of\r\nthe cell dries up and the resistance therefore becomes so great that it\r\nis practically impossible for the current to pass.\r\n\r\nThe life of such cells may be partially renewed by drilling several\r\nholes in the cell and permitting it to soak in a strong solution of sal\r\nammoniac until some of the liquid is absorbed. The holes should then be\r\nplugged up with some sealing wax in order to prevent evaporation.\r\n\r\nAn old dry cell may be easily turned into a \"wet\" cell by drilling the\r\nzinc full of holes and then setting it in a jar containing a sal\r\nammoniac solution. The battery should be allowed to remain in the\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\n*Wet batteries* are very much easier to make than dry batteries and are\r\ncapable of delivering more current.\r\n\r\nThey have the disadvantage, however, of wasting away more rapidly, when\r\nnot in service, than dry cells.\r\n\r\nThe Leclanche cell is the type generally first attempted by most\r\nexperimenters.\r\n\r\n*Carbon plates* for making such a battery are most easily and cheaply\r\nobtained from old dry cells. About the only way that a dry cell can be\r\nbroken open is with a cold-chisel and a hammer. Care must be taken,\r\nhowever, in order not to break the carbon.\r\n\r\nOrdinary jelly-glasses make good jars for small cells. Fruit-jars may be\r\nused for larger batteries by cutting the tops off so that the opening is\r\nlarger. The carbon plate contained in a dry cell is usually too long for\r\na jar of this sort and must be broken off before it can be used. The\r\nlower end is the one which should be broken because the top carries a\r\nbinding-post, with which connections can be made. A small hole is bored\r\nin the carbon rod at a distance from the bottom equal to the height of\r\nthe jar which is to be used.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 59.—A Zinc-Carbon Element, made from Heavy plates.]\r\n\r\nConsiderable care must be used in boring carbon because it is very\r\nbrittle and easily cracks. Only very light pressure should be used on\r\nthe drill. The carbon is fastened to a strip of wood, about an inch and\r\none-quarter wide, one-half an inch thick, and a little longer than the\r\ntop of the glass jar is wide.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 60.—A Method of making a Cell Element from Carbon\r\nRods.]\r\n\r\nA piece of heavy sheet zinc is fastened on the other side opposite the\r\ncarbon, with a screw. It is a good idea to paint the screws and the\r\nsurrounding portions of both the zinc and the carbon with hot paraffin\r\nwax so that the solution will not \"creep\" and attack the screws. It is\r\nalso a good plan first to soak the wooden strip in some hot paraffin\r\nuntil it is thoroughly impregnated.\r\n\r\nAmmonium chloride, or, as it is more commonly called, sal ammoniac,\r\nshould be added to a jar of water until it will dissolve no more. The\r\nzinc and carbon elements may then be placed in the solution.\r\n\r\nOne of the great disadvantages of the voltaic cell is that the zinc is\r\nattacked by the acid when the battery is not in use and cannot be\r\nallowed to remain in the solution without quickly wasting away. This is\r\ntrue in the case of the Leclanche cell only to a very small extent. The\r\nvoltaic cell is more powerful than the Leclanche cell, but the elements\r\nmust be carefully lifted out and rinsed with water every time that you\r\nare through using the cell. By using several carbon plates instead of\r\none, the cell may be made more powerful. The illustrations show several\r\nways of accomplishing this. The simplest method is to place a carbon\r\nplate on each side of the wooden strip and use a zinc in the form of a\r\nrod which passes through a hole between the two. Care must always be\r\nused to keep any screws which are used to hold the carbons or zincs in\r\nposition in the cells from touching each other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 61. An Element made from two Carbon Plates and a\r\nZinc Rod.]\r\n\r\nIn Figure 62 an arrangement of using four carbons is shown. The drawing\r\nis self-explanatory. In any of the cells using more than one carbon\r\nelement, the carbons should all be connected.\r\n\r\nIn discussing the voltaic cell we mentioned the fact that it becomes\r\npolarized, and explained this phenomenon as being caused by hydrogen\r\nbubbles collecting on the copper or positive pole. The same thing\r\nhappens in the case of carbon or any other material which is used as a\r\npositive.\r\n\r\n*Polarization* is the \"bugbear\" of batteries. It can be eliminated to a\r\ncertain extent, however, by the use of a \"depolarizer\" _placed in the\r\nsolution_. There are several such substances, the most common being\r\n_sodium bichromate_ and _potassium bichromate_. These are used in\r\nbattery preparations on the market called \"Electric Sand,\" \"Electropoian\r\nFluid,\" etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 62. A Method of Mounting four Carbon Plates.]\r\n\r\nWhen one of these is added to a sulphuric acid solution, using zinc and\r\ncarbon as the battery elements, it forms a very powerful cell, having E.\r\nM. F. of two volts.\r\n\r\nA battery solution of this kind may be prepared by adding four ounces of\r\nbichromate of potash to a solution composed of four ounces of sulphuric\r\nacid mixed with sixteen ounces of water. The battery will give a more\r\npowerful current for a longer time when this solution is used instead of\r\nthe plain sulphuric acid and water or sal ammoniac.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 63.—A Battery Element arranged for three Cells.]\r\n\r\nIt might be well at this time to caution the experimenter against the\r\ncareless handling of sulphuric acid. It is not dangerous if handled\r\nproperly, but if spilled or spattered around carelessly it is capable of\r\ndoing considerable damage to most things with which it comes in contact.\r\nDo not attempt to use it in any place but a shop or cellar. The smallest\r\ndrop coming in contact with any organic matter such as woodwork,\r\nclothing, carpets, etc., will not only discolor any of the latter, but\r\neat a hole in it. The best thing to use to counteract the effects of the\r\nacid which has been spilled or spattered is water in sufficient quantity\r\nto drench things and dilute the acid enough to render it harmless. A\r\nlittle strong ammonia will neutralize the acid and sometimes restore the\r\ncolor to clothing which has been burned by acid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 64.—A Plunge Battery, with Windlass.]\r\n\r\nAll acid batteries of this sort have the one objection that it is\r\nimpossible to leave the elements in the solution without wasting the\r\nzinc. The usual way to arrange the battery cells so that the elements\r\nmay be removed from the solution most easily is to fasten the elements\r\nto a chain or cord passing over a windlass fitted with a crank so that\r\nwhen the crank is turned the elements may be raised or lowered as\r\ndesired.\r\n\r\nA \"plunge battery\" of this sort is illustrated in Figure 64. The\r\nconstruction is so plainly shown by the drawing that it is hardly\r\nnecessary to enter into the details. The crank is arranged with a\r\ndowel-pin which passes through into a hole in the frame, so that when\r\nthe elements are lifted out of the solution the pin may be inserted in\r\nthe hole and the windlass prevented from unwinding.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 65.—A Plunge Battery adapted to a Set of Elements,\r\nas shown in Figure 63. They may be lifted out and placed on the \"Arms\"\r\nto drain.]\r\n\r\nA somewhat easier method of accomplishing the same result is that shown\r\nby Figure 65. In this, the elements are simply raised up out of the jars\r\nand laid across the two \"arms\" to drain.\r\n\r\n*The Edison-Lalande* cell employs a block of pressed copper oxide as the\r\npositive element, while two zinc plates form the negative. The exciting\r\nliquid is a strong solution of caustic soda.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 66.—An Edison-Lalande Cell.]\r\n\r\nThe copper oxide acts both as the positive element and as a depolarizer,\r\nfor the oxygen of the oxide immediately combines with any hydrogen\r\ntending to form on the plate.\r\n\r\nThis type of cell has some advantages but also many disadvantages, chief\r\namong which is the fact that the E. M. F. is very low. It is used\r\nprincipally for railway signal work, slot-machines, etc.\r\n\r\n*A Tomato-Can Battery* using caustic soda as the exciting liquid is a\r\nsimple form of home-made battery whose only disadvantage is the low\r\nvoltage that it delivers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 67.—A Tomato-Can Cell; Sectional View.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 68.—The Tomato-Can Cell Complete.]\r\n\r\nThe cell is liable to polarization, but the large surface of its\r\npositive elements protects it to some extent.\r\n\r\nThe positive element and the outer vessel is a tomato can. Within it is\r\na porous cup made out of blotting paper or unglazed earthenware such as\r\na flower pot.\r\n\r\nThe space between the can and the porous cup is filled with fine\r\nscrap-iron such as borings and turnings. A zinc plate is placed in the\r\nporous cup.\r\n\r\nThe cell is filled with a ten-per-cent solution of caustic soda.\r\n\r\nThe following table gives the names, elements, fluids, voltage, etc., of\r\nthe most useful batteries, all of which may be easily constructed by the\r\nexperimenter.\r\n\r\n\r\nSecondary or Storage Batteries\r\n\r\n\r\nThe storage battery is a very convenient means of taking energy at one\r\ntime or place and using it at some other time or place.\r\n\r\nSmall storage batteries are used in automobiles to supply current for\r\nthe headlights and spark-coils. Many automobiles are now equipped with\r\n\"electric starters,\" consisting of a dynamo-motor and a storage battery.\r\nThrowing a switch will cause the current from the storage battery to\r\ndrive the motor and \"crank\" the engine. After the engine is started, the\r\nmotor acts as a dynamo and generates a current for recharging the\r\nstorage battery.\r\n\r\nStorage batteries are also used to drive electric vehicles and cars.\r\n\r\nMany central lighting and power stations employ storage batteries to\r\nsupply the extra current demanded during rush hours. In the middle of\r\nthe day, when the \"load\" is light, the surplus current of the dynamos is\r\nused to recharge the storage batteries.\r\n\r\nWhat is really effected in the storage battery is the electrical storage\r\nof _energy_, not the storage of electricity. Properly speaking, the\r\nenergy is put into the form of chemical energy, and there is really _no\r\nmore electricity in the cell_ when it is charged than after it is\r\ndischarged.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 69.—Two Methods of Connecting Cells so as to obtain\r\nDifferent Voltage and Amperage Values.]\r\n\r\nStorage batteries are made up of plates of lead (the electrodes) or an\r\nalloy of lead cast into a \"grid\" or framework.\r\n\r\nThe framework may be one of a large number of patterns, but usually\r\nconsists of a set of bars crossing one another at right angles, leaving\r\na space between.\r\n\r\nThe spaces are filled with a paste of _lead oxide_. They are then\r\n\"formed\" by placing in a tank of acid solution and connected to a source\r\nof electric current.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 70.—Small Storage Cells.]\r\n\r\nThe plate connected to the positive wire gradually turns dark-brown in\r\ncolor, due to the changes in the paste, which gradually turns into _lead\r\nperoxide_. The paste in the negative plate becomes gray in color and\r\nchanges into a form of metallic lead called _spongy lead_.\r\n\r\nThe positive and negative plates are placed in a bundle after the\r\nforming process has been completed. They are kept apart by strips of\r\nwood or rubber called separators.\r\n\r\nThe negative plates of one cell are all connected in parallel at one end\r\nof the cell. The positive plates are connected at the other end. The\r\nliquid surrounding the plates is diluted sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\nWhen the battery has been exhausted, it is charged by connecting a\r\ndynamo with the terminals of the battery and sending a current through\r\nit. This current reverses the chemical action, which goes on during the\r\ndischarge of the battery.\r\n\r\n*A Storage Battery* furnishes the most convenient source of current for\r\nperforming all sorts of electrical experiments. It is capable of giving\r\nmore current for a longer period than dry cells and is not expensive,\r\nfor it merely requires recharging and does not have to be thrown away\r\neach time the current is used up.\r\n\r\nThe storage cell described below is made in a very simple manner and\r\nwill well repay any time or expense spent in its construction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 71.—How to make the Plates for a Storage Cell.]\r\n\r\nThe plates are cut out of a large sheet of lead, one-quarter of an inch\r\nthick. They may be made any convenient size to fit the jars which the\r\nexperimenter may have at hand. We will assume that they are to be made\r\ntwo and seven-eighths inches wide and three and one-half inches long.\r\nThey will then fit the rectangular glass storage cell which is already\r\non the market and can be procured from dealers in electrical supplies.\r\n\r\nA long terminal or lug is left projecting from the plate as shown in\r\nFigure 71.\r\n\r\nAny number of plates may be placed in a single cell, depending of course\r\nupon the size of the glass jar. We will suppose that three will just fit\r\nthe jar nicely. An odd number of plates should always be used, so that a\r\npositive plate may come between two negatives.\r\n\r\nEach cell will give two volts regardless of the number of plates.\r\nIncreasing the number of plates, however, will give the cell a greater\r\namperage capacity and make the charge last longer. Three cells (six\r\nvolts) will form a convenient set for running small fan-motors,\r\nminiature lights, etc.\r\n\r\nCut out nine plates and pile them up in sets of three with a piece of\r\nthin wood (cigar-box wood) between each pair of plates. Clamp them\r\ntogether in a vise and bore full of one-quarter-inch holes.\r\n\r\nThe plates are now ready for pasting. They are placed on a smooth slab\r\nof stone or glass and pasted with a stiff mixture of red lead and\r\nsulphuric acid (two parts water to one part acid). The paste must be\r\npressed carefully into the recesses of the plates with a flat stick.\r\nThey are then laid aside to dry and harden.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 72.—The Wood Separator.]\r\n\r\nAfter they have thoroughly dried they should be assembled as in Figure\r\n73 with one positive plate between two negative ones. The wooden\r\n\"separators\" are easily cut out of wood with a saw and penknife. The\r\nthin wood used in the construction of peach baskets is the best for the\r\npurpose. The separators should be made the same size as the lead battery\r\nplates.\r\n\r\nEach group of plates is then placed in a jar containing a mixture of\r\nsulphuric acid and water (4 parts water to one part acid). In mixing the\r\nacid be very careful to pour the acid into the water, stirring the\r\nmixture slowly at the same time, and not the water into the acid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 73.—The Complete Element for a Storage Cell.]\r\n\r\nThe plates are now ready for \"forming.\" The binding-posts on the lugs of\r\nthe plates may be secured from the carbons of some old dry cells. The\r\nsimplest method of \"forming\" the plates is to use four gravity cells and\r\n\"form\" one storage cell at a time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 74.—A Battery of Home-Made Storage Cells.]\r\n\r\nConnect the positive pole (copper) of the gravity battery to the\r\npositive pole (center-plate) of the storage cell and the negative (zinc)\r\nof the gravity battery to the negative (outside plates) of the storage\r\ncell. Allow the current to flow through the storage battery for several\r\ndays or until the positive plate turns to a dark chocolate-brown color\r\nand the negatives to a gray-slate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 75.—Gravity Cells. These consist of zinc and copper\r\nelements, immersed in a zinc-copper sulphate solution. They cannot be\r\neasily made, and are best purchased. The illustration also shows the\r\nstar-shaped copper and \"crowfoot\" zinc element used in a gravity cell.]\r\n\r\nAfter the cells have once been \"formed\" all that they require is\r\noccasional recharging from gravity cells or from a dynamo, by connecting\r\nthe positive pole of the charging current to the positive plates of the\r\nstorage cells and the negative pole to the negative plates.\r\n\r\nWhen the cells are fully charged, bubbles of gas will rise freely from\r\nthe plates. If a dynamo is used it must be \"_shunt_\" wound and not a\r\n\"_series_\" machine. Recharging will only require about one-quarter of\r\nthe time consumed in forming.\r\n\r\nIt is a very good plan to connect twelve gravity cells in series and use\r\nthem to recharge the storage battery. The gravity cells can always be\r\nkept connected to the storage cells when the latter are not in use and\r\nthus remain fully charged and ready to supply their maximum current.\r\n\r\nAfter the cells have been in use for some time, it is a good plan to\r\nlift out the plates and remove all sediment which has settled to the\r\nbottom of the jars.\r\n\r\nA set of three such storage cells will have an E. M. F. of over six\r\nvolts. Any number may be connected up in series in order to obtain a\r\nhigher voltage.\r\n\r\nStorage batteries are usually rated in \"ampere hours.\" An ampere hour is\r\nthe amount of current represented by one ampere flowing for one hour. A\r\nten-ampere-hour storage battery will deliver:\r\n\r\nOne ampere for ten hours\r\nTwo amperes for five hours\r\nFive amperes for two hours\r\nTen amperes for one hour\r\n\r\nIn other words, the result obtained by multiplying the number of amperes\r\nby the time in hours is the _ampere hour capacity_.\r\n\r\nA dynamo must have an E. M. F. of about ten volts in order to charge a\r\nthree-cell storage battery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V ELECTRO-MAGNETISM AND MAGNETIC INDUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nConnect two copper wires to a voltaic cell and stretch a portion of the\r\nwire over a compass needle, holding it parallel to it and as near as\r\npossible without touching. Then bring the free ends of the wires\r\ntogether and observe that the needle is deflected and after a few\r\nmovements back and forth comes to rest at an angle with the wire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 76.—A Current of Electricity flowing through a Wire\r\nwill deflect a Compass Needle.]\r\n\r\nNext form a rectangular loop of wire and place the needle within it as\r\nin Figure 77. A greater deflection will now be obtained. If a loop of\r\nseveral turns is formed, the deflection will be still greater.\r\n\r\nThese experiments were first performed by Oersted, in 1819, and show\r\nthat the region around a wire carrying a current of electricity has\r\n_magnetic_ properties.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 77.—If a Loop of Wire is formed about a Compass\r\nNeedle, the Deflection will be greater.]\r\n\r\nAnother interesting experiment showing the magnetic effect of a current\r\nof electricity when passing through a wire may be performed by\r\nconnecting a heavy copper wire to two or three bichromate-of-potash\r\ncells. Dip the wire into a pile of fine iron filings and a thick cluster\r\nof them will adhere to the wire as in Figure 78.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the circuit is broken so that the current of electricity\r\nceases flowing, the filings will fall off, showing that the magnetic\r\neffect ceases with the current.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 78.—Iron Filings clustered on a Wire carrying a\r\nCurrent of Electricity.]\r\n\r\nThese three simple experiments have shown that if a current of\r\nelectricity is passed through a copper wire, the wire will deflect a\r\ncompass needle, attract to itself iron filings, etc., as long as the\r\ncurrent continues to flow. As soon as the current is shut off, the\r\nmagnetic effect is _destroyed_.\r\n\r\nThe region in the neighborhood of a wire carrying a current is a _field\r\nof force_ through which lines of magnetism are flowing in exactly the\r\nsame way that they do in the neighborhood of a bar or horseshoe magnet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 79.—Magnetic Phantom formed about a Wire carrying a\r\nCurrent of Electricity.]\r\n\r\nThis is readily shown by punching a small hole in a piece of cardboard,\r\nand passing a wire carrying a strong current of electricity through the\r\nhole.\r\n\r\nIf a few iron filings are sifted on the cardboard and the latter jarred\r\nslightly with a pencil as they fall, they will arrange themselves in\r\ncircles with the wire at the center, forming a magnetic phantom and\r\nshowing the paths of the lines of magnetic force.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 80.—Magnetic Phantom formed about several Turns of\r\nwire.]\r\n\r\nBy forming the wire into a coil as in Figure 80 the magnetic field\r\ngenerated is much stronger and more plainly seen, for then the combined\r\neffect of the wires is secured.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 81.—Paper Tube wrapped with Wire for Experimental\r\nPurposes.]\r\n\r\nRoll up a small paper tube about 1/2 inch in diameter and four inches\r\nlong. Wind neatly on the tube three layers of No. 18 insulated copper\r\nwire. Pass an electric current through it from two or three cells of a\r\nbattery, and test its magnetic properties by bringing it near a compass\r\nneedle. It will be found that the coil possesses very marked magnetic\r\nproperties, and will readily cause the needle to swing about, even\r\nthough it is held quite a distance away.\r\n\r\nIf an iron bar is placed inside of the paper tube, the magnetic effect\r\nwill be greatly increased.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 82.—Showing how the Lines of Force \"Leak\" at the\r\nsides of the coil, from a Coil of Wire, and how they are concentrated by\r\nan Iron Core.]\r\n\r\nThe presence of the iron bar inside of the coil of wire greatly\r\nincreases the number of lines of force running through the coil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 83.—The Principle of an Electro-Magnet.]\r\n\r\nWhen a bar is not used, many of the lines of force leak out at the sides\r\nof the coil, and but few extend from end to end. The effect of the iron\r\ncore is not only to diminish the leakage of the lines of force, but also\r\nto add many more to those previously existing. Hence the magnetic\r\nstrength of a coil is greatly increased by the iron core.\r\n\r\nA coil of wire wrapped around an iron core forms an _electro-magnet_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 84.—if you wrap some insulated Wire around an\r\nOrdinary Nail and connect it to a Battery, it will become an\r\nElectro-Magnet.]\r\n\r\nIf you wrap some insulated wire around an ordinary nail and connect it\r\nto one or two cells of a battery it will become an electro-magnet and\r\npick up bits of iron and steel.\r\n\r\nIf you wind the wire around a small paper tube into which a nail will\r\nslide easily, the coil will draw the nail in when the current is turned\r\nOn. A hollow coil of this sort is called a solenoid.\r\n\r\nElectro-magnets and solenoids play a part in the construction of almost\r\nall electrical machinery. They form the essential parts of dynamos,\r\nmotors, telephone receivers, telegraph relays and sounders, and a host\r\nof other devices.\r\n\r\nThe form usually given to an electro-magnet depends upon the use to\r\nwhich it is to be put. The horseshoe is the most common. This consists\r\nof two electro-magnets mounted on a yoke and connected so that the two\r\nfree poles are North and South.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 85.—If you wind the Wire around a small Paper Tube\r\ninto which a Nail will slide easily, the Coil will draw the Nail in when\r\nthe Current is turned on.]\r\n\r\nElectro-magnets are made on a huge scale for lifting large castings and\r\nheavy pieces of iron. Such magnets are used in the great steel mills and\r\nin factories where nails, bolts, etc., are manufactured.\r\n\r\nMonster electro-magnets can be seen in wonderful perfection at the great\r\nsteel mill at Gary, Indiana.\r\n\r\nShips bring the ore down the lakes to Gary, where great steel jaws lift\r\nit out of the hold of the boat and carry it to the furnaces.\r\n\r\nAfter being melted, great machines pour it out. It is divided into huge\r\ningots, and these, while hot, are carried to the first part of the\r\nrolling mill.\r\n\r\nThe ingot is squeezed by a machine, made longer and narrower, then\r\nsqueezed again and made still longer and narrower.\r\n\r\nIt is started on its journey along the rollers of the mill, squeezed and\r\npressed here and there, as it travels hundreds of yards—no hand ever\r\ntouching it. It finally arrives, a red-hot steel rail, the right shape\r\nand the right length.\r\n\r\nDuring this time the steel has made a long journey and changed from a\r\nshapeless ingot to a finished rail, handled entirely by machinery guided\r\nand controlled by one or two operators, pressing levers and switches.\r\n\r\nWhen almost finished, the rail slides down an incline before a man who\r\ngrasps the rail with huge pinchers, and standing at one end, runs his\r\neye along it. As he looks along the rail he sees the defects, moves the\r\nleft or the right hand, and another man at the levers of the\r\nstraightening machine, straightens the rail as directed.\r\n\r\nAnd soon there are ten rails, perfectly straight, side by side, with\r\nmore coming down the incline to meet the glance of the man’s eye.\r\n\r\nThey are still too hot for any man’s touch and so a man sitting in a\r\ntower touches an electric switch, and along the overhead rails there\r\ncomes gliding a monster electro-magnet.\r\n\r\nThe magnet moves along, drops down upon the ten rails, lying side by\r\nside and weighing thousands of pounds. The man in the tower presses\r\nanother switch, thus turning on the current, and electricity glues the\r\nrails to the magnet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _By permission, from \"Solenoids\" by C. R. Underhill._\r\nLifting-Magnets of the type known as Plate, Billet, and Ingot Magnets.]\r\n\r\nThe ten rails are lifted at once, as easily as you would lift a needle\r\nwith your horseshoe magnet; they are carried to a flat-car, and when\r\nlowered in position, the current is turned off, releasing the rails, and\r\nthe magnet travels back for another load.\r\n\r\n\r\nInduction\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1831, Michael Faraday, a famous English chemist and physicist,\r\ndiscovered that if a magnet be suddenly plunged into a hollow coil of\r\nwire, a momentary current of electricity is generated in the coil. As\r\nlong as the magnet remains motionless, it induces no current in the\r\ncoil, but when it is moved back and forth, it sets up the currents. The\r\nsource of electrical energy is the mechanical work done in moving the\r\nmagnet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 86.—Showing how a Current of Electricity may be\r\ninduced by a Bar Magnet and a Coil.]\r\n\r\nThe medium which changes the mechanical energy into electricity is the\r\nmagnetic field which we have already seen exists in the neighborhood of\r\na magnet.\r\n\r\nA current of electricity produced in a coil in such a manner is said to\r\nbe an _induced_ current and the phenomenon is that known as _magnetic\r\ninduction_.\r\n\r\nMagnetic induction is met in the dynamo, induction coil, telephone,\r\ntransformer, some forms of motors, and a number of other electrical\r\ndevices.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 87.—A Horseshoe Magnet and a Coil arranged to\r\nproduce Electric Currents by _Induction_.]\r\n\r\nA simple experiment in which electricity is produced by magnetic\r\ninduction may be performed by winding a number of turns of fine\r\ninsulated wire around the armature or keeper of a horseshoe magnet,\r\nleaving the ends of the iron free to come in contact with the poles of\r\nthe permanent magnet. Connect the ends of the coil to a sensitive\r\ngalvanometer,¹ the ends of the armature being in contact with the poles\r\nof the horseshoe magnet as shown in Figure 87.\r\n\r\nKeeping the magnet fixed, suddenly pull off the armature. The\r\ngalvanometer will show a momentary current. Suddenly bring the armature\r\nup to the poles of the magnet; another momentary current in the reverse\r\ndirection will flow through the circuit.\r\n\r\nThe fact that it is a reverse current is shown by the actions of the\r\ngalvanometer for it will be noticed that the needle swings in the\r\nopposite direction this time.\r\n\r\nIt will also be noticed that no current is produced when the coil and\r\nmagnet are stationary. Current is only generated when the coil and\r\nmagnet are approaching one another or moving apart suddenly.\r\n\r\nThis is because it is only then that the magnetic field is changing. The\r\nfield is strongest nearest the magnet, and therefore if either the\r\nmagnet or the coil of wire is moved, the strength of that part of the\r\nfield which intersects the coil is changed. Induced currents can only be\r\ngenerated by a _changing_ magnetic field.\r\n\r\n    ¹ See chapter on Measuring Instruments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI ELECTRICAL UNITS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ampere\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are certain terms used in the electrical field to distinguish\r\nvarious properties and qualities of the electrical current with which it\r\nis well for the young experimenter to acquaint himself.\r\n\r\nOne of the first units usually required, in order to make intelligent\r\ncomparisons, is a unit of measure. The _quart_ is the unit of _measure_\r\ncommonly applied to liquids and is based upon the amount of space\r\noccupied by a certain volume. The _pound_ is a unit of weight which\r\ndetermines a certain amount of any substance by comparing the force\r\nwhich gravity exerts in pulling it to the earth with the same effect of\r\ngravity on another standard \"weight.\"\r\n\r\nElectric current is invisible and weightless, and for these and other\r\nreasons cannot be measured by the quart or weighed by the pound. The\r\nonly way that it can be measured is by means of some of the effects\r\nwhich it produces. Either the chemical, electro-magnetic, or the heating\r\neffects may be made the basis of a system of measurement.\r\n\r\nThe first method used to measure electric current was the chemical one.\r\n\r\nIf a current is passed through a solution of a chemical called copper\r\n_sulphate_ (blue vitriol) by means of two copper plates, _copper_ will\r\nbe deposited on one plate and dissolved from the other. If the current\r\nis furnished by a battery the copper will be deposited on the plate\r\nconnected with the zinc of the battery. If the current is allowed to\r\nflow for a short time and the two copper plates are then taken out and\r\nweighed it will be found that one plate is considerably heavier than the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe copper has been taken from one plate and deposited on the other by\r\nthe _electric currents_. The amount of electric current which will\r\ndeposit 1.177 grammes of copper in an hour is called an _ampere_. The\r\nampere is the unit of electrical current measurement, and implies\r\nquantity or amount.\r\n\r\nThe chemical method of measuring current was at one time put to\r\npractical service in the distribution of electric current for lighting\r\nand power. Many years ago the house meters, used to measure the current,\r\nconsisted of a jar containing two copper plates. The current used in the\r\nhouse would cause copper to deposit on one plate, and by weighing the\r\nplate the power company could determine the amount of current used, and\r\nthereby the amount of the bill. The meters nowadays make use of the\r\nmagnetic effects of the current instead of the chemical, as described\r\nlater on.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Volt\r\n\r\n\r\nFor purposes of explanation the electric current may be likened to a\r\nstream of water flowing through a pipe.\r\n\r\nIf you hold your thumb over the end of a water-pipe through which water\r\nis flowing it will push your thumb away because of the _pressure_ which\r\nthe water exerts.\r\n\r\nElectric currents also exert a _pressure_, only it is not called\r\npressure in electrical parlance, but, spoken of as _electromotive force_\r\nor _potential_.\r\n\r\nThe pressure of the water enables it to pass through small openings and\r\nto overcome the resistance offered by the pipe.\r\n\r\nWires and other electrical conductors do not offer a perfectly free path\r\nto an electric current, but also possess a resistance. It is the\r\npotential of the electro-motive force which overcomes the resistance and\r\npushes the current through the wire.\r\n\r\nAdvantage has been taken of the fact to fix a unit of electrical\r\npressure called the _volt_. The pressure of the water in a water-pipe is\r\nmeasured in pounds, but the pressure of an electric current in a wire is\r\nmeasured by _volts_. The volt is the unit of electrical force which will\r\ncause a current of one ampere to flow through a resistance of one _ohm_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ohm\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ohm is the unit of electrical resistance. The standard ohm is the\r\nresistance offered by a column of pure mercury having a section of one\r\nsquare millimeter and a length of 106.28 centimeters at a temperature of\r\n0° centigrade.\r\n\r\nThe pressure which will force sufficient current through such a column\r\nof mercury to deposit 1.177 grammes of copper in one hour is a volt, and\r\nin doing so has passed a current of one ampere through a resistance of\r\none ohm.\r\n\r\nThe units ohm, ampere, and volt, were named in honor of the three great\r\nelectricians: Ohm, Ampère, and Volta.\r\n\r\nThese three units bear a very close relation to each other which is\r\nexplained by Ohm’s Law.\r\n\r\nOhm’s Law is a simple statement of facts which it is well for the young\r\nelectrician thoroughly to understand, for it might almost be said to be\r\nthe basis of design of almost all electrical instruments.\r\n\r\nIt is simply this: The strength of a current equals the voltage divided\r\nby the resistance. It may be expressed in symbols by: _C = E/R_. Where C\r\nis the current in amperes, E is the potential in volts, and R the\r\nresistance in ohms.\r\n\r\nBy way of a simple example, we will suppose that a small telegraph\r\nsounder is connected to a battery and that the voltage of the battery is\r\n_ten volts_. We will further suppose that the resistance of the sounder\r\nconnecting wires and the battery itself is _five ohms_. Knowing these\r\ntwo facts, it is very easy to find out how many amperes are flowing\r\nthrough the sounder by substituting these values in the equation as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nC = E/R\r\nE = 10 volts and R = 5 ohms\r\ntherefore C = 10/5 or 2 amperes\r\n\r\nIn order to indicate fractions or very large values of the ampere, volt,\r\nand ohm, it is customary to use the following terms:\r\n\r\nMilli-volt = 1/1000 of a volt\r\nMill-ampere = 1/1000 of an ampere\r\nKilo-volt = 1000 volts\r\nMeg-ohm = 1,000,000 ohms\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Watt\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is no doubt perfectly plain that the water in a certain size of pipe\r\nat a pressure of 100 lbs. is more powerful than a stream of water in the\r\nsame size of pipe at 25 lbs. pressure.\r\n\r\nLikewise a current of electricity represents more power at 100 volts\r\npotential than the same current would at 25 volts. The unit of\r\nelectrical power is called the _watt_. A watt is represented by a\r\ncurrent of one ampere flowing through a wire at a potential of one volt.\r\n\r\nThe number of watts is found by multiplying the voltage by the amperage.\r\nIn the case of the sounder and battery used as an example to explain\r\nOhm’s Law, and where the voltage was 10 and the amperage found to be 2,\r\nthe number of watts is 10 x 2, or 20 watts.\r\n\r\nSeven hundred and forty-six watts represent one electrical horse-power.\r\nOne thousand watts are called a _kilo-watt_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Coulomb\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far, none of the units have taken into consideration the element of\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nIf water should be permitted to run out of a pipe into a tank until ten\r\ngallons had passed it would not be possible to tell at what rate the\r\nwater was flowing by knowing that ten gallons had passed unless it were\r\nalso known how long the water had been flowing. Ten gallons per minute\r\nor ten gallons per hour would indicate the rate of flow.\r\n\r\nOne ampere flowing for one second is the electrical unit of flow. This\r\nunit is called the _coulomb_.\r\n\r\nOne ampere flowing for one hour is called an _ampere hour_. The number\r\nof ampere hours is found by multiplying the current in amperes by the\r\ntime in hours.\r\n\r\nA battery may be said to have a capacity of 10 ampere hours. This means\r\nthat it will deliver one ampere for 10 hours (1 ampere x 10 hours = 10\r\nampere hours) or 2 amperes for 5 hours (2 amperes x 5 hours = 10 ampere\r\nhours).\r\n\r\nThe same element of time enters into consideration in connection with\r\nthe watt. One watt flowing for one hour is a _watt hour_ and one\r\nkilowatt flowing for one hour is a _kilo-watt hour_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Difference between Alternating and Direct Currents\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two distinct kinds of electric current supplied for lighting\r\nand power, one known as _direct_ current and the other as _alternating_.\r\n\r\nA _direct current_ is one which passes in one direction only. It may be\r\nrepresented by a straight line, as _A_ in Figure 88.\r\n\r\nAn alternating current is one which reverses its direction and passes\r\nfirst one way and then the other. It may be represented by a curved\r\nline, shown in Figure 88. It starts at _zero_, and gradually grows\r\nstronger and stronger. Then it commences to die away until no current is\r\nflowing. At this point it reverses and commences to flow in the opposite\r\ndirection, rising gradually and then dying away again.\r\n\r\nThis is repeated a definite number of times per second; when the current\r\nrises from zero, reverses and returns to zero, it is said to pass\r\nthrough a _cycle_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 88.—Graphic Representation of a Direct and an\r\nAlternating Current.]\r\n\r\nThe part of the curved line from _a_ to _b_ in Figure 88 represents the\r\nfirst part of the current, when it is rising. From _b_ to _c_ represents\r\nits fall. The point at which the curved line crosses the straight line\r\nis zero. At _c_ the current crosses the line and commences to flow in\r\nthe opposite direction until it reaches _d_, at which point it dies away\r\nand again crosses the line to flow in its original direction and _repeat\r\nthe cycle_.\r\n\r\nIn electrical parlance, that part of the current from _a_ to _c_ or from\r\n_c_ to _e_ is known as an _alternation_. From _a_ to _e_ is called a\r\ncycle.\r\n\r\nThe reason why alternating current is often used in place of direct\r\ncurrent is that it can be sent over the wires for long distances more\r\neconomically than direct current. This is more fully explained farther\r\non in the chapter dealing with a step-down transformer.\r\n\r\nThe number of _cycles_ taking place in one second is known as the\r\n_frequency_ of the current. The usual _frequency_ of commercial\r\nalternating currents is 60 cycles per second or 7200 alternations per\r\nminute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII ELECTRICAL APPURTENANCES\r\n\r\n\r\nWires\r\n\r\n\r\nElectric currents are usually led from place to place, at will, by means\r\nof conductors called _wires_. There are a great many kinds of wires,\r\neach adapted to some special purpose.\r\n\r\nWires are usually covered with a material called an _insulator_, in\r\norder to prevent the loss of electric current due to the wires coming\r\ninto contact with other bodies or circuits. Insulators are substances\r\nwhich do not conduct electricity.\r\n\r\nWires which are _insulated_ by heavy braids of cotton fiber and then\r\nimpregnated with some compound, such as creosote, are called\r\n_weather-proof_ wires, and are best adapted to outside service, where\r\nthey must be exposed to the action of the elements.\r\n\r\nThe wires used for interior wiring in buildings, etc., are usually\r\ninsulated with rubber, over which is placed a cotton braid to protect\r\nthe rubber.\r\n\r\nRubber cannot well be used as an insulator for all wires, although its\r\ninsulating value is very great, owing to the fact that it deteriorates\r\nunder many conditions.\r\n\r\nRubber-covered and weather-proof wires are made in a variety of\r\ninsulations. Some may have only one insulating layer, while others have\r\na great many. Different substances are used as insulators to adapt the\r\nwire to some special purpose. Copper is usually the only metal used to\r\nform the wire or conductor itself. The reason for this is that copper is\r\na better conductor than any other metal except those known as precious\r\nmetals, such as gold and silver, the cost of which prohibits their use\r\nfor such purposes. The wire may be solid, or made up of a number of\r\nsmall conductors so that it is flexible.\r\n\r\nThe various combinations of insulating layers, together with either a\r\nsolid or a stranded conductor, have made possible a variety of\r\ncurrent-carriers, known as:\r\n\r\nTheater or Stage Cable\r\nElevator Cable\r\nFixture Wire\r\nTelephone Wire\r\nMining Cable\r\nFeeder Cable\r\nBrewery Cord\r\nHeater Cord, etc.\r\n\r\ndepending upon the special use for which they were designed.\r\n\r\nThe wires which the young experimenter is likely to use in his work the\r\nmost are known as _magnet wires_, and are used for making\r\nelectro-magnets, coils, and various windings. Magnet wires may be\r\ninsulated with either silk, cotton, or enamel.\r\n\r\nSilk-covered and cotton-covered wires may be obtained with either a\r\nsingle or double covering.\r\n\r\nWires with a single covering of silk or enamel are used when it is\r\ndesirable to save space, for the covering of these two classes of magnet\r\nwires is thinner than either the cotton or double-silk-covered wire, and\r\nconsequently they require less room for winding.\r\n\r\nThe size of the wire is indicated by its diameter, and in the United\r\nStates is measured by the Brown and Sharpe gauge, often indicated by the\r\nterm, \"B. & S.\"\r\n\r\nThe preceding table shows the various sizes of wire of the Brown and\r\nSharpe gauge, and also several of their characteristics, such as weight,\r\nresistance, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nInsulators\r\n\r\n\r\nThe covering placed over wires is not the only precaution taken to\r\ninsulate them, but in the case of permanent wiring they are usually\r\nmounted on glass or porcelain supports.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 89.—Staples and Wooden Cleat used for running Low\r\nVoltage Wires.]\r\n\r\nWires used for batteries, bells, telephones, etc., operated by batteries\r\nand where the voltage is not over 20 volts, may be run under _insulated_\r\nstaples or wooden cleats inside of a building. If outside and exposed to\r\nthe weather, they should be mounted on suitable glass or porcelain\r\nknobs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 90.—Porcelain Insulators to support Electric Light\r\nWires.]\r\n\r\nElectric-light wires for inside use are commonly supported by insulators\r\nmade of porcelain and known as cleats, knobs, and tubes according to the\r\nshape.\r\n\r\nTelegraph, telephone, and power lines are usually supported by glass\r\nknobs or large porcelain insulators which screw on to wooden pins.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 91.—Glass Insulator Binding-Posts and Pin used to\r\nsupport Telegraph and Telephone wires.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBinding-Posts\r\n\r\n\r\nBinding-posts are the most convenient device to make quick connections\r\nbetween wires and other parts of electrical apparatus.\r\n\r\nBinding-posts may be either made or purchased. Those which are purchased\r\nare of course the best, and will add greatly to the appearance of any\r\ninstrument upon which they are mounted.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the best-known types of manufactured posts are shown in\r\nFigure 92.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 92.—Types of Binding-Posts.]\r\n\r\nFigure 93 shows different ways of making simple binding-posts and\r\nconnectors from screws, washers, screw-eyes, and strips of metal. The\r\ndrawings are self-explanatory and should need no comment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 93.—Home-made Binding-Posts.]\r\n\r\nThe screws and nuts obtainable from old dry cells are very convenient to\r\nuse for binding-posts and other similar purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nSwitches and Cut-Outs\r\n\r\n\r\nSwitches and cut-outs are used in electrical work for turning the\r\ncurrent on and off.\r\n\r\nIf the experimenter chooses to make them himself, care should be taken,\r\nto construct them in a strong and durable fashion, for they usually are\r\nsubjected to considerable use, with consequent wear and tear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 94.—Binding-Post removed from the Carbon of a Dry\r\nCell.]\r\n\r\nSeveral very simple home-made switches are illustrated in Figure 95.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 95.—Simple Switches. _A_, Single-Point Switch. _B_,\r\nTwo-Point Switch. _C_, Three-Point Switch. _D_, Five-Point Switch. _E_,\r\nLever with End Rolled up to form Handle. _F_, Lever with Handle made\r\nfrom part of a Spool.]\r\n\r\nThe first one shown (_A_) has one contact, formed by driving a\r\nbrass-headed tack through a small strip of copper or brass.\r\n\r\nThe movable arm is a strip of copper or brass, rolled up to form a\r\nhandle at one end. The other end is pivoted with a brass screw. The\r\nbrass screw passes through a small strip of copper or brass having a\r\nbinding-post mounted on the end. A small copper washer should be placed\r\nbetween the movable arm and the copper strip to make the switch work\r\nmore easily.\r\n\r\nA somewhat similar switch is shown by _B_ in the same illustration, only\r\nin this case a handle made from half of a spool is used, instead of\r\nrolling up the end of the arm.\r\n\r\nThe other illustrations show how the same method of construction may be\r\napplied to make switches having more than one \"point\" or contact.\r\n\r\nNo dimensions have been given for constructing these switches, because\r\nit is doubtless easier for the young experimenter to use materials which\r\nhe may have at hand, and construct a switch of his own proportions. Only\r\none suggestion is necessary, and that is to bevel the under edges of the\r\narm with a file, so that it will slip over the head of the brass tack\r\nmore easily.\r\n\r\nThe switches shown in Figure 96 are capable of carrying heavier currents\r\nthan those just described, and more nearly approach the type used on\r\nlighting and power switchboards.\r\n\r\nThe base may be made of wood, but preferably should be made of some\r\ninsulating substance such as fiber or slate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 96.—Knife Switches.]\r\n\r\nThe patterns for the metal parts are shown in Figure 97. These are cut\r\nfrom heavy sheet-brass or sheet-copper, and then bent into shape with a\r\npair of flat-nosed pliers.\r\n\r\nThe handle of the single-pole switch is driven on over the metal tongue.\r\n\r\nThe double-pole switch is almost a duplicate of the single-pole type,\r\nbut has two sets of levers and contacts, actuated by the handle, in\r\nplace of one.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 97.—Metal Parts for the Knife Switches.]\r\n\r\nThe ends of the blades to which the handle is connected are turned over\r\nat right angles and a hard-wood cross-bar fastened between the ends. The\r\nhandle is fastened to the center of the cross-bar.\r\n\r\nAfter the switch is assembled, bend the various parts until they \"line\r\nup\" that is, are in proper position in respect to each other, so that\r\nthe blades will drop into the contacts without bringing pressure to bear\r\non either one side or the other of the handle in order to force the\r\nblades into line.\r\n\r\n\r\nFuses\r\n\r\n\r\nFuses are used to prevent electrical instruments and wires from damage\r\ndue to too much current flowing through. When an electric current passes\r\nthrough a resistance it produces _heat_.\r\n\r\nA fuse is usually a short piece of lead or some alloy which melts at a\r\nlow temperature, and which is inserted in the circuit so that the\r\ncurrent must flow through it. If too much current flows through the fuse\r\nit will become hot and melt, because of its low melting-point, thus\r\ninterrupting the circuit and shutting the current off until the cause\r\nwhich occasioned the surplus current to flow can be ascertained.\r\n\r\nFuses are rated according to the amount of current which is required to\r\n\"blow\" them out, and therefore are called 1, 3, 5, or 10 ampere fuses,\r\nas the case may be.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 98.—Simple Fuses. _A_, Fuse-Block with plain Wire\r\nFuse. _D_, Fuse-Block with Mica Fuse in position.]\r\n\r\nWhen a fuse burns out in a trolley car or in a light or power circuit,\r\nit is because a greater amount of current is trying to pass than the\r\ncircuit can safely carry. If a fuse were not placed in such a circuit so\r\nas to shut the current off before the danger point is reached, any\r\nelectrical device might become \"burned out,\" or in extreme cases, the\r\nwires become so hot as to cause a serious fire.\r\n\r\nFigure 98 shows several simple forms of fuses which the experimenter may\r\neasily make to protect the batteries, etc., from short circuits.\r\n\r\nThe simplest possible fuse consists merely of a small piece of lead wire\r\nor a strip of thick tinfoil held between two binding-posts mounted upon\r\na wooden block.\r\n\r\nThe same form of fuse may be made from a strip of mica about two and\r\none-half inches long and one-half an inch wide.\r\n\r\nA strip of thin sheet-copper is bent around the ends of the mica strip.\r\n\r\nA piece of fuse wire is stretched between the two copper contacts and\r\nfastened to each with a drop of solder. Fuse wire of any desired\r\nampere-carrying capacity can be obtained from most electrical supply\r\nhouses.\r\n\r\nSuch a fuse is held in a mounting as shown by _D_. The contacts are made\r\nfrom sheet-copper or brass. They should spring together very tightly, so\r\nas to make perfect contact with the copper ends on the mica strip.\r\n\r\n\r\nLightning-Arresters\r\n\r\n\r\nLightning-arresters are used to protect all wires which run into a\r\nbuilding from outdoors, especially telegraph or telephone wires, so that\r\nstatic electricity due to lightning will not damage the instruments.\r\n\r\nLightning-arresters may be constructed in many ways and of different\r\nmaterials, but there are only two types for which the average\r\nexperimenter will have any use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 99.—Lightning-Arrester and Ground-Wire Switch.]\r\n\r\nThe arrester shown in Figure 99 is the type known as \"lightning-arrester\r\nand ground-wire switch.\" It is used principally on telegraph lines.\r\n\r\nIt consists of three pieces of sheet-brass about one-sixteenth of an\r\ninch thick, and shaped as shown by _A_, _B_, and _C_ in Figure 100.\r\n\r\nThe metal pieces are mounted on a wooden block with a narrow space of\r\nabout one-thirty-second of an inch separating them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 100.—Home-made Lightning-Arrester.]\r\n\r\nThe two outside pieces are each fitted with two binding-posts, and the\r\ncenter triangular-shaped piece is fitted with one post.\r\n\r\nA hole about one-eighth of an inch in diameter is bored between each of\r\nthe metal pieces.\r\n\r\nMake a tapered metal pin which can be placed tightly in the holes, and\r\nwill make contact between the metal pieces.\r\n\r\nThe two outside line wires of the telegraph circuit are connected to the\r\noutside metal pieces _C_ and _B_. _A_ is connected to the earth or\r\nground.\r\n\r\nIn case of a lightning storm, if the wires become charged, the small\r\nspace between the metal plates will permit the charge to jump across and\r\npass harmlessly into the ground.\r\n\r\nIf complete protection is desired, it is merely necessary to insert the\r\nplug in one of the holes, and thus \"ground\" either wire or short-circuit\r\nboth of them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 101.—Lightning-Arrester for Telephone Wires.]\r\n\r\nThe lightning-arrester shown in Figure 101 is designed for service on\r\ntelephone wires. It is an ordinary fuse provided with an arrester in the\r\nshape of two carbon blocks about one inch square. The blocks rest on a\r\ncopper strip, and are held in place by a spring-strip connected to _B_.\r\n\r\nThe carbon blocks are separated by a piece of thin sheet-mica, of the\r\nsame size as the blocks.\r\n\r\nThe post, _B_, is connected to one of the telephone-line wires near the\r\npoint where it enters the building from outdoors. The post, _A_, is\r\nconnected to the instrument; _C_ is connected to the ground.\r\n\r\nAn arrester of this kind should be connected to each one of the\r\ntelephone wires.\r\n\r\nIf the line wires should happen to come into contact with a power wire,\r\nthere is danger of damage to the instruments, but if an arrester is\r\nconnected in the circuit such an occurrence would be prevented by the\r\nblowing out of the fuse. If the lines become charged by lightning, the\r\ncharge can easily pass over the edge of the mica between the two blocks\r\nand into the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII ELECTRICAL MEASURING INSTRUMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nAn instrument designed to measure electromotive force (electrical\r\npressure) is called a _voltmeter_. An instrument designed to measure\r\nvolume of current is called an _ammeter_.\r\n\r\nThere are many forms of reliable meters for measuring current and\r\nvoltage, but all are more or less expensive and out of the reach of an\r\nordinary boy.\r\n\r\nSome meters are more carefully made than a watch, and are provided with\r\nfine hair-springs and jeweled bearings, but all depend upon the same\r\nprinciple for their action, namely, the mutual effects produced between\r\na magnetic needle and a coil of insulated wire carrying a current of\r\nelectricity.\r\n\r\nThe little meters described in this chapter are simple and inexpensive\r\nbut quite sensitive. Unlike a meter making use of a hair-spring, they\r\nwill stand considerable rough handling, but of course should not be\r\nsubjected to such treatment unnecessarily.\r\n\r\nTwo types of meters are described. Both operate on exactly the same\r\nprinciple, but one is more elaborate than the other.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Simple Voltmeter and Ammeter\r\n\r\n\r\nA base-board five inches long, two and one-half inches wide and one-half\r\ninch thick is cut out of hard wood. In its center, cut a slot\r\nthree-eighths of an inch wide and one and one-half inches long, with the\r\nslot running lengthwise the board. Along each side of the slot glue two\r\nsmall wooden blocks one and one-half inches long, one-quarter of an inch\r\nthick, and one-half of an inch high.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 102.—_A_, Base, showing Slot. _B_ and _C_, Sides and\r\nTop of the Bobbin. _D_, Base and Bobbin in Position.]\r\n\r\nWhen they are firmly in position, glue a strip of wood, two and one-half\r\ninches long, three-quarters of an inch wide and one-eighth inch thick to\r\nthe top as shown by D in Figure 102.\r\n\r\nUsing these as a support, wind a horizontal coil composed of 200 feet of\r\nNo. 36 B. & S. gauge silk-covered wire.\r\n\r\nA needle is next made from a piece of watch-spring. It should be about\r\none and one-quarter inches long, and one-eighth of an inch wide.\r\n\r\nStraighten it out by bending, and then heat the center in a small\r\nalcohol flame until the center is red-hot, taking care to keep the ends\r\nas cool as possible.\r\n\r\nThe spring is mounted on a small steel shaft made by breaking up an\r\nordinary sewing-needle. Make the piece one-half of an inch long. It must\r\nhave very sharp points at both ends. The ends may be pointed by\r\ngrinding.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 103.—Arrangement of the Needle and Pointer.]\r\n\r\nBore a small hole just large enough to receive the needle through the\r\ncenter of the spring. Insert the needle in the hole and fasten it in the\r\ncenter by two small circular pieces of wood which fit tightly on the\r\nneedle. A little glue or sealing-wax will serve to help make everything\r\nfirm.\r\n\r\nThe pointer is a piece of broom-straw, about three inches long. Bore a\r\nsmall hole in the top of one of the wooden clamps and insert the pointer\r\nin the hole, fastening it with a little glue. The pointer should be\r\nperfectly straight, and in a position at right angles to the spring.\r\n\r\nBore a small hole in the bottom of one of the wooden clamps and glue a\r\nsmall wire nail in the hole. The purpose of the nail is to serve as a\r\ncounterweight and keep the pointer in a vertical position.\r\n\r\nThe spring should be magnetized by winding ten or twelve turns of magnet\r\nwire around one end and connecting it with a battery for a moment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 104.—_A_, Bearings. _B_, How the Needle is mounted.]\r\n\r\nThe needle is mounted in two small pieces of thin sheet-brass, one inch\r\nlong and one-half inch wide. Bend each strip at right angles in the\r\nmiddle, and at one-quarter of an inch from one end make a small dent by\r\nmeans of a pointed nail and a hammer.\r\n\r\nThe strips are now slipped down in the center of the slot in the coil\r\nwith the dents inside of the coil and exactly opposite one another.\r\nAfter the exact position is found, they may be fastened into position by\r\ntwo very small screws.\r\n\r\nThe sharp-pointed sewing-needle, together with the magnetized spring,\r\npointer, and counterweight, should slip down into the dents made in the\r\nstrips and swing freely there. It may require a little filing and\r\nbending, but the work should be done patiently, because the proper\r\nworking of the meter will depend upon having the needle swing freely and\r\neasily in its place.\r\n\r\nFasten an upright board, four inches wide and one-quarter of an inch\r\nthick, to the base-board, back of the bobbin.\r\n\r\nAttach a piece of thick cardboard to the upright by means of small\r\nblocks, in such a position that the pointer swings very close to it but\r\ndoes not touch it.\r\n\r\nThe meter is now complete, except for marking or calibrating the scale.\r\nThe method of accomplishing this will be described farther on.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 105.—The Completed Meter.]\r\n\r\nIf the meter is wound with No. 36 B. & S. gauge wire it is a voltmeter\r\nfor measuring voltage. If it is wound with No. 16 B. & S. gauge wire it\r\nwill constitute an ammeter for measuring amperes.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Portable Voltmeter and Ammeter\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bobbin upon which the wire is wound is illustrated in Figure 106.\r\nThe wood is the Spanish cedar, of which cigar boxes are made. It should\r\nbe one-eighth of an inch thick, and can be easily worked with a\r\npocket-knife. In laying out the work, scratch the lines on the wood with\r\nthe point of a darning-needle. Pencil lines are too thick to permit of\r\naccuracy in small work. The bobbin when finished must be perfectly true\r\nand square.\r\n\r\nThe dimensions are best understood from the illustrations. In putting\r\nthe bobbin together, do not use any nails. Use strong glue only.\r\n\r\nTwo bobbins are required, one for the ammeter and one for the voltmeter.\r\nAfter completing the bobbins, sandpaper them and coat them with shellac.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 106.—Details of the Bobbin.]\r\n\r\nThe bobbin for the ammeter is wound with No. 14 B. & S.\r\ndouble-cotton-covered magnet wire. The voltmeter requires No. 40 B. & S.\r\nsilk-covered wire. In both cases the wire should be wound carefully in\r\nsmooth, even layers. A small hole is bored in the flange through which\r\nto pass the end of the wire when starting the first layer. After\r\nfinishing the winding, about six inches of wire should be left at both\r\nends to make connection with the terminals. The whole winding is then\r\ngiven a coat of shellac. A strip of passe-partout tape, one-half of an\r\ninch wide wound over the wire around the bobbin will not only protect\r\nthe wire from injury, but also give the bobbin a very neat appearance.\r\n\r\nThe armature is a piece of soft steel one inch long, one-eighth of an\r\ninch thick and three-eighths wide. A one-eighth-inch hole is bored\r\none-sixteenth of an inch above the center for the reception of the\r\nshaft. The center of gravity is thus thrown below the center of the mass\r\nof the armature, and the pointer will always return to zero if the\r\ninstrument is level.\r\n\r\nThe shaft is a piece of one-eighth-inch Bessemer steel rod,\r\nseven-sixteenths of an inch long. The ends are filed to a sharp\r\nknife-edge on the under side, as indicated in the figure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 107.—The Bobbin partly cut away so as to show the\r\nBearing. Details of the Armature and Shaft.]\r\n\r\nA one-sixteenth-inch hole is bored in the top of the armature to receive\r\nthe lower end of the pointer, which is a piece of No. 16 aluminum wire,\r\nfour and one-half inches long.\r\n\r\nAfter the holes have been bored, the armature is tempered so that it\r\nwill retain its magnetism. It is heated to a bright red heat and dropped\r\ninto a basin of strong salt water. The armature is then magnetized by\r\nrubbing one end against the pole of a strong magnet.\r\n\r\nThe bearings are formed by two strips of thin sheet-brass,\r\nthree-sixteenths of an inch wide, and one and one-quarter inches long,\r\nbent and glued to the sides of the bobbin.\r\n\r\nIn the illustration, part of the bobbin is represented as cut away. The\r\ncenter of the bearing is bent out so that the end of the shaft will not\r\ncome in contact with the sides of the bobbin. The top of the center is\r\nnotched with a file to form a socket for the knife-edges of the shaft.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 108.—Completed Voltmeter.]\r\n\r\nThe bobbin is glued to the center of a wooden base, seven inches long,\r\nfour inches wide and three-quarters of an inch thick. The terminals of\r\nthe coil lead down through two small holes in the base and thence to two\r\nlarge binding-posts. The wires are inlaid on the under side of the base,\r\ni.e., they pass from the holes to the binding-posts through two grooves.\r\nThis precaution avoids the possibility of their becoming short-circuited\r\nor broken.\r\n\r\nThe case is formed of two sides, a back and top of one-half-inch wood.\r\nIt is six inches high, four inches wide, and two inches deep. A glass\r\nfront slides in two shallow grooves cut in the wooden sides, one-eighth\r\nof an inch from the front.\r\n\r\nThe case is held down to the base by four round-headed brass screws,\r\nwhich pass through the base into the sides. It is then easily removable\r\nin case it ever becomes necessary to repair or adjust the instrument.\r\n\r\nThe meter and case, as illustrated in Figure 108, are intended for\r\nportable use and are so constructed that they will stand up. A small\r\nbrass screw, long enough to pass all the way through the base, serves to\r\nlevel the instrument. If a little brass strip is placed in the slot in\r\nthe screw-head and soldered so as to form what is known as a \"winged\r\nscrew,\" the adjustment may be made with the fingers and without the aid\r\nof a screw-driver.\r\n\r\nWhere the instrument is intended for mounting upon a switch-board, it\r\ncan be given a much better appearance by fitting with a smaller base,\r\nsimilar in size and shape to the top. The binding-posts are then mounted\r\nin the center of the sides.\r\n\r\nTo calibrate the meters properly, they are compared with some standard.\r\nThe scale is formed by a piece of white cardboard glued by two small\r\nblocks on the inside of the case. The various values are marked with a\r\npen and ink. The glass front, therefore, cannot be put in place until\r\nthey are located.\r\n\r\nThe zero value on the meters will normally be in the center of the\r\nscale. When a current is passed through the bobbin, the armature tends\r\nto swing around at right angles to the turns of wire. But since the\r\narmature is pivoted above the center of the mass, when it swings, the\r\ncenter of gravity is displaced and exerts a pull in opposition to that\r\nof the bobbin, and the amount of swing indicated by the pointer will be\r\ngreater as the current is stronger. The pointer will swing either to the\r\nright or the left, depending upon the direction in which the current\r\npasses through the bobbin. The pointer of the instrument illustrated in\r\nFigure 108 is at zero when at the extreme left of the scale. The pointer\r\nis bent to the left, so that the current will be registered when passing\r\nthrough the meter only in one direction, but the scale will have a\r\ngreater range of values. It will also be necessary to cut a small groove\r\nin the base of the instrument in this case so that the armature will\r\nhave plenty of room in which to swing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 109.—Circuits for Calibrating the Ammeter and\r\nVoltmeter.]\r\n\r\nWhen calibrating the ammeter, it is placed in series with the standard\r\nmeter, a set of strong batteries, and a rheostat. The rheostat is\r\nadjusted so that various current readings are obtained. The\r\ncorresponding positions of the pointer on the meter being calibrated are\r\nthen located for each value.\r\n\r\nThe voltmeters must be placed in parallel, or shunt with each other, and\r\nin series with several battery cells. A switch is arranged so that the\r\nvoltage of a varying number of cells may be passed through the meters.\r\nTo secure fractional values of a volt, the rheostat is placed in shunt\r\nwith the first cell of the battery. Then, by adjusting both the switch\r\nand the rheostat, any voltage within the maximum range of the battery\r\nmay be secured.\r\n\r\nThis means of regulating voltage is a common one, and of much use in\r\nwireless telegraph circuits, as will be explained later.\r\n\r\nWhen using the meters, it is always necessary that the ammeter shall be\r\nin series and the voltmeter in parallel or in shunt with the circuit.\r\n\r\n\r\nGalvanoscopes and Galvanometers\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the first part of Chapter V it was explained that several turns of\r\nwire surrounding a compass-needle would cause the needle to move and\r\nshow a deflection if a current of electricity were sent through the\r\ncoil.\r\n\r\nSuch an instrument is called a _galvanoscope_ and may be used for\r\ndetecting very feeble currents. A galvanoscope becomes a _galvanometer_\r\nby providing it with a scale so that the deflection may be measured.\r\n\r\nA galvanometer is really, in principle, an ammeter the scale of which\r\nhas not been calibrated to read in amperes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 110.—Simple Compass Galvanoscope.]\r\n\r\nA very simple galvanoscope may be made by winding fifty turns of No. 36\r\nB. & S. gauge single-silk-covered wire around an ordinary pocket\r\ncompass. The compass may be set in a block of wood, and the wood\r\nprovided with binding-posts so that connections are easily made.\r\n\r\nAnother variety of the same instrument is shown in Figure 111.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 111.—Galvanoscope.]\r\n\r\nWind about twenty-five turns of No. 30  B. & S. gauge cotton-covered\r\nwire around the lower end of a glass tumbler. Leave about six inches of\r\neach end free for terminals, and then, after slipping the coil from the\r\nglass, tie the wire with thread in several places so that it will not\r\nunwind. Press two sides of the coil together so as to flatten it, and\r\nthen attach it to a block of wood with some hot sealing-wax.\r\n\r\nMake a little wooden bridge as shown in Figure 111, and mount a\r\ncompass-needle on it in the center. The compass-needle may be made out\r\nof a piece of spring-steel in the manner already described in Chapter I.\r\n\r\nMount two binding-posts to the corners of the block, and connect the\r\nends of the wire coil to them. Turn the block so that the needle points\r\nNorth and South and parallel to the coil of wire.\r\n\r\nIf a battery is connected to the binding-posts, the needle will fly\r\naround to a position at right angles to that which it first occupied.\r\n\r\nAn astatic galvanoscope is one having two needles with their poles in\r\nopposite directions. The word \"astatic\" means having no directive\r\nmagnetic tendency. If the needles of an astatic pair are separated and\r\npivoted separately, they will each point to North and South in the\r\nordinary manner. But when connected together with the poles arranged in\r\nopposite directions they neutralize each other.\r\n\r\nAn astatic needle requires but very little current in order to turn it\r\neither one way or the other, and for this reason an astatic galvanoscope\r\nis usually very sensitive.\r\n\r\nA simple instrument of this sort may be made by winding about fifty\r\nturns of No. 30-36 B. & S. gauge single-silk or cotton-insulated wire\r\ninto a coil around a glass tumbler. After removing the coil from the\r\nglass, shape it into the form of an ellipse and fasten it to a small\r\nbase-board.\r\n\r\nSeparate the strands of wire at the top of the coil so that they are\r\ndivided into two groups.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 112.—Astatic Galvanoscope.]\r\n\r\nMake a bridge or standard in the shape of an inverted U out of thin\r\nwooden strips and fasten it to the block.\r\n\r\nThe needles are ordinary sewing-needles which have been magnetized and\r\nshoved through a small carrier-bar, made from a strip of cardboard, with\r\ntheir poles opposite one another, as shown in the illustration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 113.—Astatic Needles.]\r\n\r\nThey may be held in place in the cardboard strip by a small drop of\r\nsealing-wax.\r\n\r\nA small hole is punched in the top of the carrier, through which to pass\r\nthe end of a thread. The upper end of the thread passes through a hole\r\nin the bridge and is tied to a small screw-eye in the center of the\r\nupper side of the bridge.\r\n\r\nThe carrier-bar is passed through the space where the coil is split at\r\nthe top. The lower needle should hang in the center of the coil. The\r\nupper needle should be above and outside the coil.\r\n\r\nThe terminals of the coil are connected to two binding-posts mounted on\r\nthe base-block.\r\n\r\nOwing to the fact that this galvanoscope is fitted with an astatic\r\nneedle, the instrument does not have to be turned so that the coil may\r\nface North and South. The slightest current of electricity passing into\r\nthe coil will instantly affect the needles.\r\n\r\nAn astatic galvanometer for the detection of exceedingly weak currents\r\nand for use in connection with a \"Wheatstone bridge\" for measuring\r\nresistance, as described farther on, will form a valuable addition to\r\nthe laboratory of the boy electrician.\r\n\r\nMake two small bobbins similar to those already described in connection\r\nwith the volt and ammeter, but twice as long, as shown in Figure 114.\r\n\r\nWind each of the bobbins in the same direction with No. 36 silk-covered\r\nor cotton-covered wire, leaving about six inches free at the ends for\r\nconnection to the binding-posts.\r\n\r\nFasten each of the bobbins to the base-board with glue. Do not nail or\r\nscrew them in position, because the presence of nails or screws may\r\nimpair the sensitiveness of the instrument. In mounting the bobbins,\r\nleave about one-sixteenth of an inch of space between the inside\r\nflanges, through which the needle may pass.\r\n\r\nConnect the coils wound on the bobbins so that the end of the outside\r\nlayer of the first coil is connected to the inside layer of the other\r\ncoil. This arrangement is so that the current will travel through the\r\nwindings in the same continuous direction, exactly the same as though\r\nthe bobbin were one continuous spool.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 114.—Bobbin for Astatic Galvanometer.]\r\n\r\nMagnetize two small sewing-needles and mount them in a paper stirrup\r\nmade from good, strong paper, as shown in Figure 114. Take care that the\r\npoles are reversed so that the north pole of one magnet will be on the\r\nsame side of the stirrup as the south pole of the other. They may be\r\nfastened securely by a drop of shellac or melted sealing-wax.\r\n\r\nCut out a cardboard disk and divide it into degrees as in Figure 115.\r\nGlue the disk to the top of the bobbins. A small slot should be cut in\r\nthe disk so that it will pass the lower needle.\r\n\r\nA wooden post should be glued to the back of the base. To the top of\r\nthis post is fastened an arm from which are suspended the magnetic\r\nneedles.\r\n\r\nA fine fiber for suspending the needle may be secured by unraveling a\r\npiece of embroidery silk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 115.—Completed Astatic Galvanometer.]\r\n\r\nThe upper end of the fiber is tied to a small hook in the end of the\r\narm. The wire hook may be twisted so that the needles may be brought to\r\nzero on the scale. Zero should lie on a line parallel to the two coils.\r\n\r\nThe fiber used for suspending the needles should be as fine as possible.\r\nThe finer the fiber is, the more sensitive will the instrument be.\r\n\r\nThe lower needle should swing inside of the two coils, and the upper\r\nneedle above the disk.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Make a Wheatstone Bridge\r\n\r\n\r\nThe amateur experimenter will find many occasions when it is desirable\r\nto know the resistance of some of his electrical apparatus. Telephone\r\nreceivers, telegraph relays, etc., are all graded according to their\r\nresistance in ohms. The measurement of resistance in any electrical\r\ninstrument or circuit is usually accomplished by comparing its\r\nresistance with that of some known circuit, such as a coil of wire which\r\nhas been previously tested.\r\n\r\nThe simplest method of measuring resistance is by means of a device\r\nknown as the Wheatstone bridge. This instrument is very simple but at\r\nthe same time is remarkably sensitive if properly made. A Wheatstone\r\nbridge is shown in Figure 116.\r\n\r\nThe base is a piece of well-seasoned hard wood, thirty inches long, six\r\ninches wide, and three-quarters of an inch thick.\r\n\r\nSecure a long strip of No. 18 B. & S. gauge sheet-copper, one inch wide,\r\nand cut it into three pieces, making two of the pieces three inches\r\nlong, and the other piece twenty-three and one-half inches long.\r\n\r\nMount the copper strips on the base, as shown, being very careful to\r\nmake the distance between the inside edges of the end-pieces just\r\ntwenty-five inches. The strips should be fastened to the base with small\r\nround-headed brass screws. Mount two binding-posts on each of the short\r\nstrips in the positions shown in the illustration, and three on the long\r\nstrip. These binding-posts should pass through the base and make firm\r\ncontact with the strips.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 116.—Wheatstone Bridge.]\r\n\r\nThen make a paper scale twenty-five inches long, and divide it into one\r\nhundred equal divisions one-quarter of an inch long. Mark every fifth\r\ndivision with a slightly longer line, and every tenth division with a\r\ndouble-length line.\r\n\r\nStart at one end and number every ten divisions, then start at the other\r\nend and number them back, so that the scale reads 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50,\r\n60, 70, 80, 90, 100, from right to left at the top and 0, 10, 20, 30,\r\n40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, from left to right at the bottom.\r\n\r\nSolder a piece of No. 30 B. & S. gauge German-silver wire to one of the\r\nshort copper strips opposite the end of the scale, and then stretch it\r\ntightly across the scale and solder it to the strip at the other end.\r\n\r\nMake a knife-contact by flattening a piece of heavy copper wire as shown\r\nin Figure 117. Solder a piece of flexible wire, such as \"lamp cord,\" at\r\nthe other end. It is well to fit the contact with a small wooden handle,\r\nmade by boring out a piece of dowel.\r\n\r\nThe instrument is now practically complete.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 117.—Knife-Contact.]\r\n\r\nIn order to use the Wheatstone bridge, it is necessary to have a set of\r\nresistances of known value. The resistance of any unknown circuit or\r\npiece of apparatus is found by comparing it with one of the known coils.\r\nIt is just like going to a store and buying a pound of sugar. The grocer\r\nweighs out the sugar by balancing it on the scales with an iron weight\r\nof known value, and taking it for granted that the weight is correct, we\r\nwould say that we have one, five, or ten pounds of sugar, as the case\r\nmay be.\r\n\r\nThe Wheatstone bridge might be called a pair of \"electrical scales\" for\r\nweighing resistance by comparing an unknown coil with one which we know\r\nhas a certain value.\r\n\r\nThe next step is to make up some standard resistance coils. Secure some\r\nNo. 32 B. & S. gauge single-cotton-covered wire from an electrical\r\ndealer and cut into the following lengths, laying it straight on the\r\nfloor but using care not to pull or stretch it.\r\n\r\n1/2 ohm coil—3 feet 1/2 inch\r\n1 ohm coil—6 feet 1 1/4 inches\r\n2 ohm coil—12 feet 2 1/2 inches\r\n5 ohm coil—30 feet 6 1/4 inches\r\n10 ohm coil—61 feet\r\n20 ohm coil—122 feet\r\n30 ohm coil—183 feet\r\n50 ohm coil—305 feet\r\n\r\nThese lengths of wire are then wrapped on the spools in the following\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 118.—Resistance-Coil. _A_ shows how the Wire is\r\ndoubled and wound on the Spool. _B_ is the completed Coil.]\r\n\r\nThis method of winding is known as the non-inductive method, because the\r\nwindings do not generate a magnetic field, which might affect the\r\ngalvanometer needle used in connection with the Wheatstone bridge as\r\ndescribed later on.\r\n\r\nEach length of wire should be doubled exactly in the middle, then\r\nwrapped on the spools like a single wire, the two ends being left free\r\nfor soldering to the terminals as shown in Figure 118, B.\r\n\r\nThe spools may be the ordinary reels upon which cotton and sewing-silk\r\nare wrapped.\r\n\r\nThe terminals of the spools are pieces of stout copper wire, No. 12 or\r\nNo. 14 B. & S. gauge. Two pieces of wire about three inches long are\r\ndriven into holes bored in the ends of each spool. A small drop of\r\nsolder is used permanently to secure the ends of the coil to each of the\r\nheavy wire terminals.\r\n\r\nThe spools are then dipped into a pan of molten paraffin and boiled\r\nuntil the air bubbles cease to rise.\r\n\r\nThe spools should be marked 1, 2, 10, 20, 30, and 50, according to the\r\namount of wire each one contains as indicated in the table above.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Use a Wheatstone Bridge for Measuring Resistance\r\n\r\n\r\nThe instrument is connected as in Figure 116.\r\n\r\nThe unknown resistance or device to be measured is connected across the\r\ngap at _B_. One of the standard known coils is connected across the gap\r\nat _A_. A sensitive galvanometer or a telephone receiver and two cells\r\nof battery are also connected as shown.\r\n\r\nIf a telephone receiver is used, place it to the ear. If a galvanometer\r\nis used instead, watch the needle carefully. Then move the sharp edge of\r\nthe knife-contact over the scale along the German-silver \"slide wire\"\r\nuntil a point is reached when there is no deflection of the needle or no\r\nsound in the telephone receiver.\r\n\r\nIf this point lies very far on one side or the other of the center\r\ndivision on the scale, substitute the next higher or lower known\r\nresistance spool until the point falls as near as possible to the center\r\nof the scale.\r\n\r\nWhen this point is found, note the reading on the scale carefully. Now\r\ncomes the hardest part. Almost all my readers have no doubt progressed\r\nfar enough in arithmetic to be able to carry on the following simple\r\ncalculation in proportion which must be made in order to find out the\r\nresistance of the unknown coil.\r\n\r\nThe unknown resistance, connected to _B_, bears the same ratio to the\r\nknown coil, at _A_, that the number of divisions between the\r\nknife-contact and the right-hand end of the scale (lower row of figures)\r\nbears to the number of divisions between the knife-edge and the\r\nleft-hand end of the scale (upper row of figures).\r\n\r\nWe will suppose that a 5-ohm coil was used at _A_ in a test, and the\r\nneedle of the galvanometer stopped swinging when the knife-contact\r\nrested on the 60th division from the left-hand end, or on the 40th from\r\nthe right. Then, in order to find the value of the unknown resistance at\r\n_B_, it is simply necessary to multiply the standard resistance at _A_\r\nby the number of left-hand divisions and divide the product by the\r\nnumber of right-hand divisions. The answer will be the resistance of _B_\r\nin ohms.\r\n\r\nThe calculation in this case would be as follows:\r\n\r\n5 X 40 = 200\r\n\r\n200/60 = 3.33 ohms\r\n\r\n3.33 ohms is the resistance of _B_.\r\n\r\nThis explanation may seem very long and complex, but if you will study\r\nit carefully you will find it to be very simple. When once you master\r\nit, you will be enabled to make many measurements of resistance which\r\nwill add greatly to the interest and value of your experiments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX BELLS, ALARMS, AND ANNUNCIATORS\r\n\r\n\r\nAn electric bell may be bought almost anywhere for twenty-five cents,\r\nand from the standpoint of economy it does not pay to build one.\r\n\r\nA bell is not a hard thing to construct, and the time and money spent\r\nwill be amply repaid by the more intimate knowledge of this useful piece\r\nof apparatus which will be gained by constructing it.\r\n\r\nThe base is four inches wide and five and one-half inches long.\r\n\r\nThe magnets consist of two machine bolts, wound with No. 22\r\ncotton-covered magnet wire. Fiber ends are fitted on the bolts to hold\r\nthe wire in place.\r\n\r\nThe wire is wound on each of the magnets separately. Cover the cores\r\nwith two or three layers of paper before winding on the wire. The ends\r\nof the wire are led through holes in the core ends. The ends of the\r\nbolts are passed through the yoke, and the nuts applied to hold them in\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nThe magnets are clamped down to the bell-base by means of a hard-wood\r\nstrip having a screw passed through it between the magnets into the\r\nbase.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 119.—Details of the Magnet Spools, and Yoke for an\r\nElectric Bell.]\r\n\r\nThe armature of the bell is shown in Figure 120. It is made of a piece\r\nof iron having a steel spring riveted to it, as illustrated. The\r\narmature is fastened to a small block mounted on the lower left-hand\r\ncorner of the base.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 120.—Details of the Armature, and Contact Screw.]\r\n\r\nA second block with a contact-point made from an ordinary brass screw by\r\nfiling the end into the shape shown in the illustration, is mounted on\r\nthe base so that it is opposite the end of the contact-spring fastened\r\nto the armature. The gong may be secured from an old bell or alarm\r\nclock. It is mounted on the upper part of the base in such a position\r\nthat the hammer will strike it on its lower edge.\r\n\r\nThe instrument is connected as shown in Figure 121. One terminal of the\r\nmagnets is connected to the contact-screw. The other end is connected to\r\nthe binding-post. A second binding-post is connected to the armature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 121.—The Completed Bell.]\r\n\r\nThe armature spring should be bent so that the armature is pushed over\r\nagainst the contact.\r\n\r\nIf a battery is connected to the bell, the electromagnets will pull the\r\narmature and cause the hammer to strike the gong. As soon as the\r\narmature has moved a short distance, the spring will move away from the\r\ncontact and break the circuit. The magnets cease pulling as soon as the\r\ncurrent is cut off and the armature spring then causes the armature to\r\nmove back and touch the contact. As soon as the contact is made, the\r\narmature is drawn in again and the process is repeated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 122.—Diagram showing how to connect a Bell, Battery,\r\nand Push-Button.]\r\n\r\nA little experimenting with the bell will soon enable one to find its\r\nbest adjustment. Figure 122 shows how to connect a bell to a battery and\r\na push-button. A push-button is simply a small switch which closes the\r\ncircuit when pressed. Do not make the armature spring too weak, or the\r\nhammer will move very slowly and with very little life. Each time that\r\nthe armature moves toward the magnets, it should barely touch the iron\r\ncores before the ball strikes the bell.\r\n\r\nAfter you get the bell in good working order, it is well to make a small\r\nbox to serve as a cover for the working parts of the instrument, leaving\r\nonly the gong exposed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 123.—Two Simple Push-Buttons.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 124.—Diagram showing how to arrange a Bell System of\r\nReturn Signals.]\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes desirable to arrange two bells and two push-buttons, so\r\nthat a return signal can be sent. In that case the circuit shown in\r\nFigure 124 may be employed. It is then possible for the person answering\r\nthe bell to indicate that he has heard the call by pushing the second\r\nbutton. For instance, one push-button and bell might be located on the\r\ntop floor of a house and the other bell and button in the basement. A\r\nperson in the basement wishing to call another on the top floor would\r\npush the button. The person answering could return the signal by pushing\r\nthe button on the top floor and cause the bell in the basement to ring.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Burglar Alarm\r\n\r\n\r\nA simple method of making an efficient burglar alarm is shown in Figure\r\n125. The base is a piece of wood about five by six inches, and half an\r\ninch thick. A small brass strip, _A_, is fastened to the base by means\r\nof two round-headed wood screws and the ends turned up at right angles.\r\nThe lever, _B_, is also a strip of brass. One end is bent out, so as to\r\nclear the strip and the screws that are under it. The lever is pivoted\r\nin the middle with a screw and a washer. A small hole, _D_, is bored in\r\nthe lower end through which a spring and a string are passed. The other\r\nend of the spring is fastened under a screw and washer, _C_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 125.—Burglar-Alarm Trap.]\r\n\r\nIn order to set the alarm, first fasten the base in any convenient\r\nplace. Carry the string across the room and fasten it. Adjust the string\r\nso that the lever is half-way between the two ends of the strip, _A_.\r\n\r\nIf the string is disturbed, it will pull the lever over against the\r\nstrip, _A_. If the string is cut, the spring will pull the lever over to\r\nthe opposite side. In either case, if the alarm is properly connected to\r\na bell and battery, the circuit will be closed if the string is\r\ndisturbed, and the bell will ring.\r\n\r\nOne wire leading from the bell and the battery should be connected to\r\n_A_, and the other to the screw and washer, _C_.\r\n\r\nThe alarm may be arranged across a window or doorway and a black thread\r\nsubstituted for the string. Any one entering in the dark and unaware of\r\nthe existence of the alarm is liable to break the thread and ring the\r\nbell.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Electric Alarm\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is often desirable to arrange an electrical alarm clock so that a\r\nbell will ring continuously until shut off.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 126.—An Early-Riser’s Electric Alarm Attachment for\r\na Clock.]\r\n\r\nFigure 126 shows an electrical alarm attachment. It consists of a wooden\r\nbox, large enough to receive an ordinary dry cell. A bell is fastened on\r\nthe outside of the box. Connect one terminal of the battery to one\r\nterminal of the bell. Connect the other bell and battery terminals, each\r\nto a short piece of brass chain, about four inches long. The ends of the\r\nchain are then fastened to a small piece of sheet fiber or hard rubber,\r\nso that they are insulated from each other. The opposite end of the\r\nfiber is fastened to a piece of wire spring having a garter or suspender\r\nclip soldered to the end.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 127.—Details of the Chain Electrodes, etc.]\r\n\r\nThe operation of this electrical attachment is very simple. Wind up the\r\nalarm key of an ordinary alarm clock and place the clip on the key.\r\nPlace the clock in such a position that the two chains do not touch each\r\nother. Set the clock. When the mechanical alarm goes off, the key will\r\nrevolve and twist the two chains, thus closing the electric circuit and\r\ncausing the bell to ring. The bell will ring until the clamp is removed.\r\nThe outfit can be attached to any ordinary alarm clock.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Annunciator\r\n\r\n\r\nAnnunciators are often placed in bell and burglar alarm-circuits to\r\nindicate where the button ringing the bell was pushed, in case there are\r\nseveral.\r\n\r\nThe separate indicators used on an annunciator are called _drops_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 128.—An Annunciator Drop.]\r\n\r\nA drop may be made from an electromagnet and some brass strips, etc.\r\n\r\nThe frame is cut from heavy sheet-brass and shaped as shown in Figures\r\n128 and 129.\r\n\r\nThe drop bar is a strip of metal which is pivoted on the frame at its\r\nlower end and has the upper end turned up to receive a numeral or\r\nletter.\r\n\r\nThe armature is made from a strip of sheet-iron. It is pivoted on the\r\nframe at its upper end. The strip is bent at right angles so as to fall\r\nin front of the magnet. The lower part of the armature is bent into a\r\nhook. The hook fits into a slot cut in the drop bar. A fine wire spring\r\nis placed between the frame and the upper end of the armature so as to\r\npull the armature away from the core when the current is not passing\r\nthrough the magnet.\r\n\r\nThe electromagnet should be wound with No. 25 B. & S. cotton-covered\r\nmagnet wire.\r\n\r\nWhen a current is sent through the magnet, it will draw the armature in.\r\nThis action releases the hook from the edge of the slot in the drop bar\r\nand permits the bar to drop and bring the number or letter down into\r\nview.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 129.—Details of the Drop-Frame and Armature.]\r\n\r\nA number of \"drops\" may be arranged on a board and placed in different\r\ncircuits so as to indicate which circuit is closed at any time. It is a\r\ngood plan to arrange a bar to act as a stop, so that the numeral will\r\nnot drop down too far. Each time that any one of the drops falls, it\r\nmust be reset by pushing the bar back into position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X ELECTRIC TELEGRAPHS\r\n\r\n\r\nExperiments in telegraphy were carried out as far back as the year 1753,\r\nwhen it was proposed to transmit messages by representing the letters of\r\nthe alphabet by combinations of sparks produced by a static machine; but\r\nthese were of little practical value and nothing of any importance was\r\naccomplished until after the discovery of galvanic current.\r\n\r\nMany of these old experiments were very crude and appear somewhat\r\nridiculous when compared with the methods of nowadays. The earliest\r\nproposal for an electric telegraph appeared in the _Scots’ Magazine_ for\r\nFebruary, 1753, and shows several kinds of proposed telegraphs acting by\r\nthe attractive power of electricity, conveyed by a series of parallel\r\nwires, one wire corresponding to each letter of the alphabet and\r\nsupported by glass rods at every twenty yards. Words were to be spelled\r\nby the action of the electricity in attracting paper letters, or by\r\nstriking bells corresponding to letters.\r\n\r\nThe modern telegraph consists essentially of four things, namely:\r\n\r\nA battery which produces an electric current.\r\n\r\nA wire which conducts the electric current from one point to another.\r\n\r\nA transmitter for shutting the current off and on.\r\n\r\nAn electro-magnetic receiving apparatus, which gives out in sounds, the\r\nsignals made by the pulsations of the current from a distant point.\r\n\r\nThe battery may be almost any form of battery. Gravity cells are\r\npreferred, however, for telegraph work.\r\n\r\nHeavy galvanized iron wire is usually employed as the \"line.\" It is\r\nnecessary to use non-conductors wherever the wire is fastened. Glass\r\ninsulators placed on a wooden pin or bracket, which is fastened to the\r\npole or building on which the wire is to be supported, are used for\r\noutside work. Inside of buildings, rubber tubes are used where the wires\r\npass through walls, etc.\r\n\r\nThe operation of a telegraph is not, as many people suppose, a\r\ncomplicated or difficult matter to understand, but is quite simple.\r\n\r\nThe key is a contrivance for controlling the passage of the electric\r\ncurrent in much the same manner as an ordinary switch. It consists of a\r\nsteel lever, swung on trunnion-screws mounted in a frame, and provided\r\nwith a rubber knob which the operator grasps lightly with the thumb and\r\nforefinger. On pressing the lever downward, a platinum point fastened on\r\nthe under side of the lever is brought into contact with another point\r\nset into a rubber bushing in the base of the key, so that there is no\r\nelectrical connection between the two points unless the key is pressed\r\ndown or \"closed,\" as it is often termed. The key is usually fastened to\r\nthe operating bench by two rods called \"legs.\" The lever is provided\r\nwith screws which permit the stroke of the key to be very closely\r\nadjusted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 130.—A Typical Telegraph Key, showing the Various\r\nParts.]\r\n\r\nThe line wire and battery are connected to the key, so that no current\r\ncan flow until the key is pressed and the contacts brought together.\r\n\r\nA \"sounder\" consists of two electromagnets mounted on a base under a\r\nmovable flat piece of iron which is attracted by the magnetism of the\r\nelectromagnets when a current flows through them and is withdrawn by a\r\nspring when no magnetism excites the windings.\r\n\r\nThis piece of iron, which is called the armature, is mounted upon a\r\nstrip of brass or aluminum called the lever. The lever strikes against a\r\nbrass \"anvil\" and produces the \"clicks,\" which form the dots and dashes\r\nof the telegraph alphabet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 131.—A Typical Telegraph Sounder, showing the\r\nVarious Parts.]\r\n\r\nEvery time that the key is pressed, an electric current is sent out into\r\nthe line. The current flows through the magnets of the sounder and\r\ncauses the armature to be drawn downward. The lever strikes the anvil\r\nand produces a \"click.\" When the key lever is released, the current is\r\nshut up and the lever flies up and clicks against the top of the anvil.\r\n\r\nThe period of time between the first click and the second click may be\r\nvaried at will according to the length of time that the key is held\r\ndown. A short period is called a _dot_ and a long period a _dash_.\r\nCombinations of dots, dashes, and spaces arranged according to the Morse\r\nAlphabet, make intelligible signals.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow To Make a Simple Key and Sounder\r\n\r\n\r\nThe little telegraph instruments shown in Figures 132 and 133 are not\r\npractical for long lines but may be used for ticking messages from one\r\nroom to another, and can be made the source of much instruction and\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 132.—A Simple Home-made Telegraph Key.]\r\n\r\nThe key is a strip of brass fastened to a wooden base in the manner\r\nshown in Figure 132. It is fitted with a knob of some sort on the front\r\nend, so that it is conveniently gripped with the fingers.\r\n\r\nThe little bridge is made from heavy sheet-brass and prevents the lever\r\nfrom moving too far away from the contact on the upward stroke.\r\n\r\nConnections are made to the key lever at the back end and the contact in\r\nfront by the binding-posts, _A_ and _B_. The post, _C_, connects with\r\nthe bridge.\r\n\r\nThe sounder consists of two small electromagnets mounted in a vertical\r\nposition on a wooden base. The magnets are connected at the bottom by a\r\nstrip of heavy sheet-iron which acts as a yoke.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 133.—A Simple Home-made Telegraph Sounder.]\r\n\r\nThe armature is made out of sheet-iron, rolled up in the manner shown in\r\nthe illustration. One end of the armature is fastened to a wooden block\r\nin such a position that the armature comes directly over the magnets and\r\nabout one-eighth of an inch above them. The opposite end of the armature\r\nmoves up and down for about an eighth of an inch between two screws,\r\neach fastened in a wooden block mounted on an upright board in the back\r\nof the magnets. The purpose of the screws is to make the \"click\" of the\r\nsounder louder and clearer than it would be if the armature only struck\r\nthe wood.\r\n\r\nA rubber band or a small wire spring passing over a screw and connected\r\nat the other end to the armature will draw the latter away from the\r\nmagnets when the current is not passing.\r\n\r\nThe terminals of the magnets are connected to binding-posts mounted on\r\nthe base.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 134.—A Diagram showing how to connect two Simple\r\nTelegraph Stations.]\r\n\r\nThe key and sounder should be placed in series with one or two cells of\r\na battery. Pressing the key will then cause the armature of the sounder\r\nto be drawn down and make a click. When the key is released, the\r\narmature will be drawn up by the spring or rubber band and make a second\r\nclick.\r\n\r\nHardly a boy interested in mechanics and electricity has not at some\r\ntime or other wished for a telegraph instrument with which to put up a\r\n\"line\" with his chum.\r\n\r\nA practical working set of such instruments can be very easily\r\nconstructed, and with little expense, by following the sketches and\r\ninstructions given here.\r\n\r\nThe magnets for the sounder may either be constructed by the intending\r\ntelegraph operator or secured from some old electrical instrument such\r\nas a magneto-bell. In the latter case, the hardest part of the work will\r\nbe avoided.\r\n\r\nIf they are to be home-made, the following suggestions may prove of\r\nvalue in carrying out their construction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 135.—A Complete Telegraph Set, consisting of a\r\nKeyboard and a Sounder.]\r\n\r\nThe cores are made from one-quarter-inch stove-bolts with the heads cut\r\noff. The magnet heads are cut out of hard-wood fiber, one-eighth of an\r\ninch thick and one inch in diameter. They should fit tightly and be held\r\nin place with glue. They are separated so as to form a winding space\r\nbetween of seven-eighths of an inch. The magnets should be wound full of\r\nNo. 25 B. & S. gauge cotton-covered wire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 136.—Details of the Telegraph Set shown in Figure\r\n135.]\r\n\r\nThe yoke is made of enough strips of sheet-iron, one-half inch wide and\r\ntwo inches long, to form a pile one-quarter of an inch thick. Two\r\none-quarter-inch holes are bored in the opposite ends of the yoke, one\r\nand one-half inches apart. The lower ends of the magnet cores are passed\r\nthrough these holes. The ends should project one-half of an inch beyond\r\nthe yoke.\r\n\r\nThey are passed through two holes in a base-board three-quarters of an\r\ninch thick. The holes are countersunk from the lower side, so that a nut\r\ncan be screwed on the lower end of each and the magnets held tightly in\r\nan upright position. The remaining parts of the instrument are very\r\neasily made, and are so clearly shown by the drawing that it is hardly\r\nnecessary to say more than a few words in explanation.\r\n\r\nThe lever or tongue, the anvil, the standard, and the lever of the key\r\nare all cut out of hard-wood according to the pattern shown in the\r\nillustration.\r\n\r\nThe armature is a piece of soft iron fastened to the lever with a small\r\nbrass screw.\r\n\r\nTacks are placed under the heads of the adjusting screws on the sounder\r\nso that it will click more loudly.\r\n\r\nThe rubber band acts as a spring to counteract the weight of the\r\narmature and lever and draw it up as soon as the current is cut off. The\r\nmovement of the lever should be so adjusted that it is only sufficient\r\nto make an audible click.\r\n\r\nUse care to avoid friction between the lever and the standard, so that\r\nthe former will move with perfect freedom.\r\n\r\nAll the screws used in the work should be round-headed brass wood screws\r\nwith the points filed flat. Bore a small hole before screwing them into\r\nplace so as to avoid splitting the wood.\r\n\r\nThe construction of the key is even more simple than that of the\r\nsounder. It should move up and down without any side motion.\r\n\r\nThe circuit-closer should be kept closed when the instruments are not in\r\nuse, and when you are receiving a message. As soon as you are through\r\nreceiving and wish to transmit, you should open your circuit-closer and\r\nyour friend close his.\r\n\r\nThe tension of the spring under the lever of the key must be adjusted to\r\nsuit the needs of each individual operator.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 137.—A Diagram showing how to connect two Complete\r\nTelegraph Sets, using one Line Wire and a Ground. The Two-Point Switches\r\nthrow the Batteries out of Circuit when the Line is not in use.]\r\n\r\nThe diagram for connecting the instruments is self-explanatory. In\r\ncities or towns where a \"ground\" is available by connecting to the gas\r\nor water pipes, one line wire may be easily dispensed with. Or, if\r\ndesirable, a ground may be formed by burying a large plate of zinc\r\n(three or four feet square) in a moist spot and leading the wire to it.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow To Build a Telegraph Relay\r\n\r\n\r\nIn working a telegraph over a long line or where there are a large\r\nnumber of instruments on one circuit, the currents are often not strong\r\nenough to work the sounder directly. In such a case a _relay_ is used.\r\nThe relay is built on the same principle as a sounder, but the parts are\r\nmade much lighter, so that the instrument is more sensitive. The\r\narmature of a relay is so small and its movement so little that its\r\nclicking is scarcely audible. It is therefore fitted with a second set\r\nof contacts and connected to a battery and a sounder, which is to set in\r\noperation every time the contacts close. The principle of a relay is\r\nthat a weak current of insufficient strength to do the work itself may\r\nset a strong local current to do its work for it.\r\n\r\nThere are many forms of relays, and while that which is described below\r\nis not of the type commonly used on telegraph lines, it has the\r\nadvantage of being far more sensitive than any instrument of the regular\r\nline relay type that the average experimenter could build.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 138.—Details of the Relay Parts.]\r\n\r\nMake the magnets from one-quarter-inch stove-bolts, and cut them off so\r\nthat they will form a core about two and one-quarter inches long. Fit\r\neach of the cores with two fiber heads to hold the wire in place.\r\nInsulate the legs with paper and wind each with about fifty layers of\r\nNo. 30 B. & S. gauge single-cotton-covered magnet wire. The winding\r\nspace between the magnet’s heads should be one and one-eighth inches.\r\n\r\nThe upper ends of the magnet cores should be allowed to project about\r\none-quarter of an inch beyond the fiber head. The end of the core is\r\nfiled flat, as shown in the illustration.\r\n\r\nThe magnets are mounted upon an iron yoke, three-sixteenths of an inch\r\nthick. The holes in the yoke should be spaced so that there is a\r\ndistance of one and one-half inches between the centers of the magnet\r\ncores.\r\n\r\nThe armature of the relay is mounted on a small steel shaft with sharp\r\npoints at each end. The exact shape of the armature may be best\r\nunderstood from the illustrations.\r\n\r\nThe lower end of the shaft rests in a small cone-shaped depression made\r\nby driving a center punch into the yoke half-way between the two\r\nmagnets.\r\n\r\nThe top bearing is a strip of brass projecting from a wooden support.\r\nThe end of the shaft rests in a depression similar to that in the yoke.\r\n\r\nThe contact lever is made of brass and forced on the shaft below the\r\narmature. It swings between a small brass clip fastened to one side of\r\nthe support and a little screw held in a similar clip on the opposite\r\nside.\r\n\r\nThe contact clip is made of spring brass about No. 22 gauge in\r\nthickness. It may be adjusted by a screw passing through the support.\r\n\r\nThe armature may be controlled in its movement so that the latter will\r\nbe very slight by adjusting the screws.\r\n\r\nThere should not be any friction in the bearings and the armature should\r\nmove with perfect freedom. The armature should approach the ends of the\r\nmagnet cores until a space about the thickness of heavy paper separates\r\nthem and should not touch them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 139.—The Completed Relay.]\r\n\r\nThe spring is made of fine brass wire. It is fastened to the armature\r\nshaft, and the screw mounted on the wooden support with a piece of silk\r\nthread. The thread is passed around the shaft once or twice so that the\r\ntension of the spring will cause the armature to move away from the pole\r\npieces just as soon as the current flowing through the magnets ceases.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 140.—A Diagram showing how to connect a Relay,\r\nSounder, and Key. Closing the Key will operate the Relay. The Relay will\r\nthen operate the Sounder in turn.]\r\n\r\nThe tension of the spring may be adjusted by turning the screw with a\r\nscrew-driver. If the armature tends to stick to the magnet poles fasten\r\na small piece of paper to the poles with some shellac.\r\n\r\nThe terminals of the magnets are connected to two binding-posts marked\r\n_A_ and _B_. The binding-posts marked _C_ and _D_ are connected\r\nrespectively to the contact clip and the brass bearing on the top of the\r\nwooden support.\r\n\r\nThe diagram in Figure 140 shows how the relay is connected to a\r\ntelegraph line.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow To Learn To Telegraph\r\n\r\n\r\nThe instruments so far described have been practical working telegraph\r\ninstruments, but they lack the fine points of commercial apparatus and\r\nit is not possible to become as efficient an operator with their aid as\r\nwith a real key and sounder.\r\n\r\nIf the young experimenter desires to become a proficient telegraph\r\noperator, the first thing to do is to purchase a Learner’s telegraph key\r\nand sounder.\r\n\r\nConnect a dry cell to the binding-posts on the back of the instrument.\r\nScrew the set down on a table about eighteen inches from the front edge,\r\nso that there is plenty of room for the arm to rest. See that none of\r\nthe various adjustment screws about the instrument are loose and that\r\nthe armature of the sounder moves freely up and down through a distance\r\nof about one-sixteenth of an inch.\r\n\r\nThe spring which draws the lever upwards away from the magnets should be\r\nset only at sufficient tension to raise the lever when no current is\r\npassing. If too tight, the spring will not allow the armature to respond\r\nto the current flowing through the magnets.\r\n\r\nThe key is provided with several adjustment-screws to regulate the\r\ntension and the play of the lever to suit the hand of the operator. A\r\nlittle practice will enable the student to judge best for himself just\r\nhow the key should be set.\r\n\r\nThe next step is to memorize the alphabet, so that each character can\r\ninstantly be called to mind at will. The punctuation marks are not used\r\nvery frequently, and the period is the only one which the student need\r\nlearn at first.\r\n\r\nThe Morse alphabet consists of dots, dashes, and spaces. Combinations of\r\nthese signals spell letters and words.\r\n\r\nMany of the characters are the reverse of others. For example, _A_ is\r\nthe reverse of _N_. _B_ and _F_, _D_ and _U_, _C_ and _R_, _Q_ and _X_,\r\n_Z_ and _&_, are the other reverse letters, so if the formation of one\r\nof each of these letters is memorized the reverse is easily mastered.\r\n\r\nIt is important that the beginner should learn how properly to grasp the\r\nkey, for habits are easily formed and a poor position will limit the\r\nsending speed of the operator.\r\n\r\nPlace the first or index finger on the top of the key-handle, with the\r\nthumb under the edge; and the second finger on the opposite side. The\r\nfingers should be curved so as to form a quarter-section of a circle.\r\nBring the third and fourth fingers down so that they are almost closed\r\non the palm of the hand. Rest the arm on the table in front of the key\r\nand allow the wrist to be perfectly limber.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 141.—How to hold a Telegraph Key.]\r\n\r\nThe grasp on the key should be firm but not rigid. Avoid using too much\r\nstrength or a light hesitating touch. Endeavor to acquire a positive,\r\nfirm up and down motion of the key. Avoid all side pressure, and do not\r\nallow the fingers to leave the key when making the signals. The movement\r\nis made principally with the wrist, with the fingers and hand perfectly\r\nelastic.\r\n\r\nA dot is made by a single instantaneous, downward stroke of the key. A\r\ndash is made by holding the key down for the same period of time that it\r\ntakes to make three dots. A long dash is made by holding the key down\r\nfor the same time that it takes to make five dots.\r\n\r\nA space in the letters, such as, for instance, the space between the\r\nfirst and last two dots in the letter _R_ should occupy the time of one\r\ndot. The space between each letter should occupy the time required for\r\ntwo dots, and the space between words should occupy the time required\r\nfor three dots.\r\n\r\nCommence the use of the key by making dots in succession, first at the\r\nrate of two every second, and increasing the speed until ten can be\r\nmade. Practice should be continued until three hundred and sixty dots a\r\nminute can be made with perfect regularity.\r\n\r\nThen begin making dashes at the rate of two every three seconds, and\r\ncontinue until one hundred and twenty a minute can be made with perfect\r\nregularity.\r\n\r\nPractise the long dashes at the rate of one a second, and increase until\r\nninety can be made in a minute.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 142.—The Morse Telegraphic Code.]\r\n\r\nWhen this has been accomplished, practise the following letters until\r\nthey can be perfectly made. Each row of letters is an exercise which\r\nshould be practised separately until mastered.\r\n\r\nDot Letters\r\n\r\n    E I S H P 6\r\n\r\nDot and Space Letters\r\n\r\n    O C R Y Z &\r\n\r\nDash Letters\r\n\r\n    T L M 5 O\r\n\r\nDots and Dashes\r\n\r\n    A U V 4\r\n\r\nDashes and Dots\r\n\r\n    N D B 8\r\n\r\nMixed Dots and Dashes\r\n\r\n    F G J K Q W X 1 2 3 7 9 Period\r\n\r\nAfter you can write these different letters, practise making words.\r\nSelect a list of commonly used words. When words seem easy to write,\r\npractise sending pages from a book.\r\n\r\nSystematic and continual practice will enable the student to make\r\nsurprising progress in mastering the art of sending.\r\n\r\nReading and receiving messages must be practised with a companion\r\nstudent. Place two instruments in separate rooms or in separate houses\r\nso that the operators will be entirely dependent upon the instruments\r\nfor their communication with each other. Start by transmitting and\r\nreceiving simple messages. Then use pages from a book, and increase the\r\nspeed until it is possible to send and receive at least 15 words a\r\nminute without watching the sounder but merely depending upon the clicks\r\nto determine the duration of the dots and dashes.\r\n\r\nFigure 140 shows how to arrange a regular telegraph line for two\r\nstations. Gravity batteries should be used for regular telegraph work.\r\nIt is necessary that the key should be kept closed by having its\r\ncircuit-closer shut when messages are not being sent. If one of the keys\r\nis left open the circuit is broken, and it is not possible for a person\r\nat the other end of the line to send a message.\r\n\r\nEvery telegraph office has a name or call usually consisting of two\r\nletters; thus for New York the call might be N. Y. and for Chicago, C.\r\nH.\r\n\r\nIf New York should desire to call Chicago, he would repeat the call\r\nletters, C H., until answered. Chicago would answer by sending I,\r\nseveral times and signing, C H. When so answered, New York would proceed\r\nwith the message.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI MICROPHONES AND TELEPHONES\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1878, David Edward Hughes discovered that the imperfect contact\r\nformed between two pieces of some such substance as carbon or charcoal\r\nis very sensitive to the slightest changes in pressure, and when\r\nincluded in an electric circuit with a battery and a telephone receiver,\r\nwill transmit sounds. Such an instrument is called a _microphone_. It\r\nhas various forms but in most of them one piece of carbon or charcoal is\r\nheld loosely between two other pieces in such a manner as to be easily\r\naffected by the slightest vibrations conveyed to it through the air or\r\nany other medium.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 143.—A Microphone connected to a Telephone Receiver,\r\nand a Battery.]\r\n\r\nFigure 143 illustrates a simple form of instrument embodying this\r\nprinciple. A small pencil of carbon is supported loosely between two\r\nblocks of the same substance glued to a thin wooden sounding-board of\r\npine. The sounding-board is mounted in an upright position on a wooden\r\nbase. The carbon pencil rests loosely in two small indentations in the\r\ncarbon blocks. The blocks are connected, by means of a very fine wire or\r\na strip of tinfoil, with one or two cells of battery and a telephone\r\nreceiver. Any vibration or sounds in range of the microphone will cause\r\nthe sounding-board to vibrate. This will affect the pressure of the\r\ncontact between the carbon pencil and the two blocks. When the pressure\r\nbetween the two is increased the resistance in the path of the electric\r\ncurrent is decreased and more current immediately flows through the\r\ncircuit. On the other hand, when the pressure is decreased, the\r\nresistance is increased and less current flows through the telephone\r\nreceiver. The amount of current flowing in the circuit thus keeps step\r\nwith the changes in the resistance, and accordingly produces sounds in\r\nthe telephone receiver. The vibrations emitted from the receiver are\r\nusually much greater than those of the original sounds, and so the\r\nmicrophone may be used to magnify weak sounds such as the ticking of\r\nclock-wheels or the footfalls of insects. If a watch is laid on the base\r\nof the microphone, the ticking of the escapement wheel can be heard with\r\nstartling loudness. The sounds caused by a fly walking on a microphone\r\nmay be made to sound as loud as the tramp of a horse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 144.—A Very Sensitive Form of Microphone, with which\r\nthe Footsteps of a Fly can be heard.]\r\n\r\nThe electrical _stethoscopes_ used by physicians to listen to the action\r\nof the heart are in principle only a microphone and telephone receiver\r\nconnected to a battery.\r\n\r\nThe drawing in Figure 144 illustrates a very sensitive microphone that\r\nis quite easy to make. With this instrument it is possible to hear the\r\ntramping of a fly’s feet or the noise of its wings.\r\n\r\nThe base upon which the apparatus is mounted serves as the\r\nsounding-board and is made in the form of a hollow wooden box. It can be\r\nmade from an ordinary cigar-box by removing the paper and taking the box\r\napart. The piece forming the top of the box must be planed down until it\r\nis only three thirty-seconds of an inch thick. The box should measure\r\nabout five inches square and three-quarters of an inch thick when\r\nfinished. Do not use any nails or small brads whatsoever in its\r\nconstruction, but fasten it together with glue. If you use any nails you\r\nwill decrease the sensitiveness of the instrument quite appreciably. The\r\nbottom of the box should be left open. The result is a sounding-board of\r\nthe same principles as that of the banjo head. Small feet, one-quarter\r\nof an inch square, are glued to the four under corners so as to raise\r\nthe bottom clear of the table, or whatever the microphone may be placed\r\nupon. The bottom of each one of the small feet is cushioned with a layer\r\nof felt so that no jars will be transmitted to the instrument by any\r\nobject upon which it is resting.\r\n\r\nThe carbon pencil used on this type of instrument is pivoted in the\r\ncenter and rests at one end upon a carbon block.\r\n\r\nThe carbon block is made about one inch long, one-quarter of an inch\r\nthick, and one-half of an inch wide. A small hole is drilled near each\r\nend to receive a screw which fastens the block to the sounding-board. A\r\nfine wire is led from one of these screws to a binding-post mounted at\r\nthe side of the box. Another wire leads from a second binding-post to a\r\nstandard which is also fastened to the sounding-board with a small\r\nscrew.\r\n\r\nThe standard is made from a sheet of thin brass and is bent into the\r\nshape shown in the illustration.\r\n\r\nThe pencil is a piece of one-quarter-inch carbon rod, two and\r\nthree-quarter inches long. A small hole is drilled one and five-eighths\r\nof an inch from one end with a sewing-needle, and a piece of fine brass\r\nwire, pointed at both ends, pushed in. The wire should be a tight fit in\r\nthe hole. It should be about one-half of an inch long, and may be made\r\nfrom an ordinary pin.\r\n\r\nThe slide-bar is used to regulate the pressure of the pencil upon the\r\ncarbon block and is simply a piece of soft copper wire about one-eighth\r\nof an inch in diameter. It is bent into the shape shown in the\r\nillustration so that it will slide over the carbon pencil. The sides of\r\nthe standard should press just tightly enough against the ends of the\r\npivot which passes through the carbon pencil to hold it in position\r\nwithout slipping, and at the same time allow it to swing freely up and\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nThe two binding-posts should be connected in series with two dry cells\r\nand a pair of good telephone receivers. Place the receivers against the\r\nears. Move the slide-bar gently back and forth until the voice of any\r\none talking in another part of the room can be heard distinctly in the\r\ntelephone receivers. In order to hear faint whispers, move the slide-bar\r\naway from the carbon block.\r\n\r\nIn order to hear a fly walk it is necessary to have the carbons very dry\r\nand clean. The instrument must be very carefully adjusted. Cover the\r\nmicrophone with a large glass globe and place a fly inside of the globe.\r\nWhenever the fly walks on any part of the microphone you will be able to\r\nhear each footstep in the telephone receivers. When he flies about\r\ninside of the globe, his wings will cause a loud roaring and buzzing\r\nnoise to be heard in the receivers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTelephones\r\n\r\n\r\nNot many years ago, when the telephone made its first appearance, it was\r\nthe wonder of the times just as wireless telegraphy is to-day. Starting\r\nas an exceedingly simple and inexpensive apparatus, it has gradually\r\ndeveloped into a wonderful and complex system, so that at the present\r\ntime, instead of experiencing difficulty in telephoning over distances\r\nof fifty or one hundred miles, as at first, it is possible to carry on a\r\nconversation over a line two thousand miles long as easily as it is face\r\nto face.\r\n\r\nLike the telegraph, the principle of the telephone is that of a current\r\nof electricity flowing over a line wire into a pair of electro-magnets,\r\nbut with many important differences.\r\n\r\nWhen compared with telegraph apparatus, the telephone is found to be\r\nexceedingly sensitive. A telegraph relay requires perhaps about\r\none-hundredth of an ampere to work it properly. A telegraph sounder will\r\nrequire about one-tenth of an ampere, but a telephone receiver will\r\nrender speech audible with less than a millionth of an ampere, and\r\ntherefore may almost be said to be a hundred thousand times more\r\nsensitive than a sounder.\r\n\r\nAnother difference between the telephone and the telegraph lies in the\r\nfact that the currents flowing over a telegraph line do not usually vary\r\nat a rate greater than twenty or thirty times a second, whereas\r\ntelephone currents change their intensity hundreds of times a second.\r\n\r\nThe telephone is an instrument for the transmission of speech to a\r\ndistance by means of electricity, wherein the speaker talks to an\r\nelastic plate of thin sheet-iron which vibrates and sends out a\r\npulsating current of electricity.\r\n\r\nThe transmission of the vibrations depends upon well-known principles of\r\nelectricity, and does not consist of the actual transmission of sounds,\r\nbut of electrical impulses which keep perfect accord or step with the\r\nsound waves produced by the voice in the transmitter. These electrical\r\ncurrents pass through a pair of small electro-magnets acting upon a\r\nplate or diaphragm, which in turn agitates the air in a manner similar\r\nto the original voice speaking into the transmitter and thus emits\r\nsounds.\r\n\r\nThat part of the apparatus which takes up the sounds and changes them\r\ninto electric currents composes the _transmitter_. When words are spoken\r\ninto the mouthpiece they strike a diaphragm, on the back of which is\r\nfastened a small cup-shaped piece of carbon. A second cup is mounted in\r\na rigid position directly back of the first. The space between them is\r\nfilled with small polished granules of carbon. When these granules are\r\nin a perfectly loose state and are undisturbed, their resistance to an\r\nelectric current is very great and they allow almost none to flow.² When\r\nslightly compressed their resistance is greatly lowered and they permit\r\nthe current to pass. The vibrations of the diaphragm cause the carbon\r\ncup mounted on its back to move and exert a varying pressure upon the\r\ngranules with a corresponding variation in their resistance and the\r\namount of current which will pass through.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 145.—A Telephone System, consisting of a Receiver,\r\nTransmitter, and a Battery connected in Series. Words spoken into the\r\nTransmitter are reproduced by the Receiver.]\r\n\r\nThe _receiver_, or that part of the apparatus which transforms the\r\npulsating current back into sound waves consists of a thin iron disk,\r\nplaced very near but not quite touching the end of a small steel bar,\r\npermanently magnetized, and about which is wound a coil of fine\r\ninsulated wire.\r\n\r\nThe transmitter and the receiver are connected together in series with a\r\nbattery as in Figure 145. When words are spoken into the transmitter the\r\nlittle carbon granules are immediately thrown into motion, and being\r\nalternately compressed and released cause corresponding changes in the\r\ncurrent flowing through the receiver from the battery. The magnetism of\r\nthe receiver changes with each change in the electric current, and thus\r\nby alternately attracting and repelling the diaphragm causes it to\r\nvibrate and emit sounds. Such is the _principle_ of the telephone. The\r\ntelephones in actual service to-day are complicated with bells,\r\nmagnetos, induction coils, condensers, relays, and various other\r\napparatus, which fact renders them more efficient.\r\n\r\nThe bells and magnetos are for the purpose of calling the central\r\noperator or the person at the other end of the line and drawing\r\nattention to the fact that some one wishes to get into communication\r\nwith him. The older styles of telephones used what is known as a\r\npolarized bell and a hand magneto for this purpose. A polarized bell is\r\na very sensitive piece of apparatus which will operate with very little\r\ncurrent. A magneto is a small hand dynamo which when turned with a crank\r\nwill generate a current causing the bell at the other end of the line to\r\nring. When the telephone receiver is raised off its hook in order to\r\nplace it to the ear the bell and magneto are automatically disconnected\r\nfrom the line and the receiver and the transmitter are connected in\r\ntheir place. The current necessary to supply the telephone and receiver\r\nis supplied by two or three dry cells placed inside of each telephone.\r\n\r\nThe latest types of instruments employ what is known as the central\r\nenergy system, wherein the current is supplied by a large storage\r\nbattery located at the central office and serving as a current supply to\r\nall the telephones connected to that system.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible to enter into the history of the telephone far\r\nenough to explain the details of some of the various systems in\r\nevery-day use in such a book as this because of the immense amount of\r\nmaterial it would be necessary to present. Such a work would occupy a\r\nvolume of its own. Additional information may be readily found in any\r\nreference library. However, the \"boy electrician\" who wishes to make a\r\ntelephone for communicating between the house and barn, or with his chum\r\ndown the street, will find the necessary information in the following\r\npages. If this work is carried out carefully and a home-made telephone\r\nsystem built and installed it will not only prove a very interesting\r\nundertaking but will also serve to dispel all mystery which may surround\r\nthis device in the mind of the young experimenter.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Build a Telephone\r\n\r\n\r\nTelephone receivers are useful for many purposes in electrical work\r\nother than to receive speech. They are used in connection with wireless\r\ninstruments, in place of a galvanometer in measuring electrical\r\ncircuits, and for testing in various ways.\r\n\r\nTelephone receivers are of two types. One of them is long and\r\ncumbersome, and is very similar to the original Bell telephone receiver.\r\nThe other is small and flat, and is called a \"watch-case\" receiver. A\r\nwatch-case receiver is shown in Figure 146. It consists of a U-shaped\r\npermanent magnet so mounted as to exert a polarizing influence upon a\r\npair of little electro-magnets, before the poles of which is placed an\r\niron diaphragm. For convenience, these parts are assembled in a small\r\ncylindrical casing, usually of hard rubber. The permanent magnet exerts\r\na continual pull upon the diaphragm, tending to draw it in. When the\r\ntelephone currents pass through the little magnets, they will either\r\nstrengthen the permanent magnet and assist it in attracting the\r\ndiaphragm, or detract from its strength and allow the diaphragm to\r\nrecede, depending upon which direction the current flows.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 146.—A Watch-Case Telephone Receiver.]\r\n\r\nWatch-case receivers are usually employed for wireless telegraph work\r\nbecause they are very light in weight and can easily be attached to a\r\nhead-band in order to hold them to the ears and leave the hands free.\r\nWatch-case receivers can be purchased for forty-five to seventy-five\r\ncents at almost any electrical supply house. They are very useful to the\r\namateur experimenter in many ways.\r\n\r\nA telephone receiver capable of giving fair results on a short telephone\r\nline can be very easily made, but of course will not prove as efficient\r\nas one which is purchased ready-made from a reliable electrical\r\nmanufacturer.\r\n\r\nThe first practical telephone receiver was invented by Alexander Graham\r\nBell and was made somewhat along the same lines as that shown in Figure\r\n147.\r\n\r\nSuch a receiver may be made from a piece of curtain-pole, three and\r\nthree-quarter inches long and about one and one-eighth inches in\r\ndiameter. A hole, three-eighths of an inch in diameter, is bored along\r\nthe axis throughout its entire length, to receive the permanent magnet.\r\n\r\nThe shell of the receiver is a cup-shaped piece of hard wood, two and\r\none-half inches in diameter and one inch deep. It will have to be turned\r\non a lathe. Its exact shape and dimensions are best understood from the\r\ndimensions shown in the cross section in Figure 147. The shell is firmly\r\nattached to one end of the piece of curtain-pole by gluing.\r\n\r\nThe permanent magnet is a piece of hard steel, three-eighths of an inch\r\nin diameter and four and five-eighths of an inch in length. The steel\r\nwill have to be tempered or hardened before it will make a suitable\r\nmagnet, and the best way to accomplish this is to have a blacksmith do\r\nit for you by heating the rod and then plunging it into water when just\r\nat the right temperature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 147.—A Simple Form of Telephone Receiver.]\r\n\r\nOne end of the bar is fitted with two thick fiber washers about\r\nseven-eighths of an inch in diameter and spaced one-quarter of an inch\r\napart. The bobbin so formed is wound full of No. 36 B. & S. gauge\r\nsingle-silk-covered magnet wire. The ends of the wire are passed through\r\ntwo small holes in the fiber washers and then connected to a pair of\r\nheavier wires. The wires are run through two holes in the curtain-pole,\r\npassing lengthwise from end to end, parallel to the hole bored to\r\nreceive the bar magnet.\r\n\r\nThis bar magnet is then pushed through the hole until the end of the rod\r\non which the spool is fixed is just below the level of the edges of the\r\nshell.\r\n\r\nThe two wires are connected to binding-posts, _A_ and _B_, mounted on\r\nthe end of the receiver. A hook is also provided so that the receiver\r\nmay be hung up.\r\n\r\nThe diaphragm is a circular piece of thin sheet-iron, two and one-half\r\ninches in diameter. It is placed over the shell, and the bar magnet\r\nadjusted until the end almost touches the diaphragm. The magnet should\r\nfit into the hole very tightly, so that it will have to be driven in\r\norder to be moved back and forth.\r\n\r\nThe diaphragm is held in place by a hard-wood cap, two and three-quarter\r\ninches in diameter and having a hole three-quarters of an inch in\r\ndiameter in the center. The cap is held to the shell by means of four\r\nsmall brass screws.\r\n\r\nThe receiver is now completed and should give a loud click each time\r\nthat a battery is connected or disconnected from the two posts, _A_ and\r\n_B_.\r\n\r\nThe original Bell telephone apparatus was made up simply of two\r\nreceivers without any battery or transmitter. In such a case the current\r\nis generated by \"induction.\" The receiver is used to speak through as\r\nwell as to hear through. This method of telephoning is unsatisfactory\r\nover any appreciable distances. The time utilized in making a\r\ntransmitter will be well spent.\r\n\r\nA simple form of transmitter is shown in Figure 148. The wooden back,\r\n_B_, is three and one-half inches square and three-quarters of an inch\r\nthick. The front face of the block is hollowed out in the center as\r\nshown in the cross-section view.\r\n\r\nThe face-plate, _A_, is two and one-half inches square and one-half an\r\ninch thick. A hole, seven-eighths of an inch in diameter, is bored\r\nthrough the center. One side is then hollowed out to a diameter of one\r\nand three-quarter inches, so as to give space for the diaphragm to\r\nvibrate as shown in the cross-sectional drawing.\r\n\r\nThe carbon buttons are one inch in diameter and three-sixteenths of an\r\ninch thick. A small hole is bored in the center of each to receive a\r\nbrass machine screw. The hole is countersunk, so as to bring the head of\r\nthe screw down as close to the surface of the carbon as is possible.\r\nThen, using a sharp knife or a three-cornered file, score the surface of\r\nthe carbon until it is covered with criss-cross lines.\r\n\r\nThe diaphragm is a piece of thin sheet-iron cut in the form of a circle\r\ntwo and one-half inches in diameter. A small hole is bored through the\r\ncenter of this. One of the carbon buttons is fastened to the center of\r\nthe diaphragm with a small screw and a nut.\r\n\r\nCut out a strip of flannel or thin felt, nine-sixteenths of an inch wide\r\nand three and one-half inches long. Around the edge of the carbon button\r\nmounted on the diaphragm, bind this strip with silk thread in such a\r\nmanner that the strip forms a cylinder closed at one end with the\r\nbutton.\r\n\r\nFill the cylinder with polished carbon telephone transmitter granules to\r\na depth of about one-eighth of an inch. These granules will have to be\r\npurchased from an electrical supply house. They are finely polished\r\nsmall carbon balls, much like birdshot in appearance.\r\n\r\nSlip a long machine-screw through the hole in the second carbon button\r\nand clamp it in place with a nut. Then place the carbon button in the\r\ncylinder so that it closes up the end. The space between the two buttons\r\nshould be about three-sixteenths of an inch. Bind the flannel or felt\r\naround the button with a piece of silk thread so that it cannot slip out\r\nof place. The arrangement of the parts should now be the same as that\r\nshown by the cross-sectional drawing in the upper right-hand corner of\r\nFigure 148.\r\n\r\nThe complete transmitter is assembled as shown in the lower part of\r\nFigure 148.\r\n\r\nA small tin funnel is fitted into the hole in the face-plate, _A_, to\r\nact as a mouthpiece.\r\n\r\nA screw passes through the back, _B_, and connects to the diaphragm. The\r\nscrew is marked \"_E_\" in the illustration. A binding-post is threaded on\r\nthe screw so that a wire may be easily connected. The screw passing\r\nthrough the back carbon button also passes through a hole in the wooden\r\nback, and is clamped firmly in position with a brass nut so that the\r\nbutton is held very rigidly and cannot move. The front button, being\r\nattached to the diaphragm, is free to move back and forth with each\r\nvibration of the latter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 148.—A Home-made Telephone Transmitter.]\r\n\r\nThe carbon granules should fill the space between the buttons\r\nthree-quarters full. They should lie loosely together, and not be packed\r\nin.\r\n\r\nWhen connected to a battery and a telephone receiver the current passes\r\nfrom the post, _D_, to the back button, through the mass of carbon\r\ngranules into the front button and out at the post, _E_. When the voice\r\nis directed into the mouthpiece, the sound waves strike the diaphragm\r\nand cause it to vibrate. The front button attached to it then also\r\nvibrates and constantly changes the pressure on the carbon granules.\r\nEach change in pressure is accompanied by an immediate change in\r\nresistance and consequently the amount of current flowing.\r\n\r\nFigure 149 shows a complete telephone ready for mounting on the wall. It\r\nconsists of a receiver, telephone transmitter, bell, hook, and\r\npush-button. The bell is mounted on a flat base-board. The transmitter\r\nis similar to that just described, but is built into the front of a\r\nbox-like cabinet. The box is fitted with a push-button at the lower\r\nright-hand corner. A simple method of making a suitable push-button is\r\nshown in the upper left-hand part of the illustration. It consists of\r\ntwo small brass strips arranged so that pushing a small wooden plug\r\nprojecting through the side of the cabinet will bring the two strips\r\ntogether and make an electrical connection.\r\n\r\nThe \"hook\" consists of a strip of brass, pivoted at one end with a\r\nround-headed brass wood screw and provided with a small spring, so that\r\nwhen the receiver is taken off of the hook it will fly up and make\r\ncontact with a screw, marked _C_ in the illustration. When the receiver\r\nis on the hook, its weight will draw the latter down against the screw,\r\n_D_. The hook is mounted on the base-board of the telephone, and\r\nprojects through a slot cut in the side of the cabinet.\r\n\r\nFour binding-posts are mounted on the lower part of the base-board. The\r\ntwo marked _B_ and _B_ are for the battery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 149.—A Complete Telephone Instrument. Two\r\nInstruments such as this are necessary to form a simple Telephone\r\nSystem.]\r\n\r\nThat marked _L_ is for the \"line,\" and _G_ is for the ground connection\r\nor the return wire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 150.—Diagram of Connection for the Telephone\r\nInstrument shown in Fig. 149.]\r\n\r\nThe diagram of the connections is shown in Figure 150. The line-wire\r\ncoming from the telephone at the other station enters through the\r\nbinding-post marked _L_, and then connects to the hook. The lower\r\ncontact on the hook is connected to one terminal of the bell. The other\r\nterminal of the bell leads to the binding-post marked _G_, which is\r\nconnected to the ground, or to the second line-wire, where two are used.\r\n\r\nThe post, _G_, and one post, _B_, are connected together. The other post\r\nmarked _B_ connects to one terminal of the transmitter. The other\r\nterminal of the transmitter is connected to the telephone receiver. The\r\nother post of the telephone receiver leads to the upper contact on the\r\nhook marked _C_. The push-button is connected directly across the\r\nterminals of the transmitter and the receiver so that when the button is\r\npushed it short-circuits the transmitter and the receiver. When the\r\nreceiver is on the hook and the latter is down so that it makes contact\r\nwith _D_ any current coming over the line-wire will pass through the\r\nbell and down through the ground or the return-wire to the other\r\nstation, thus completing the circuit. If the current is strong enough it\r\nwill ring the bed. When the receiver is lifted off the hook, the spring\r\nwill cause the hook to rise and make contact with the screw marked _C_.\r\nThis will connect the receiver, transmitter, and the battery to the line\r\nso that it is possible to talk. If, however, it is desired to ring the\r\nbell on the instrument at the other end of the line, all that it is\r\nnecessary to do is to press the push-button. This will short-circuit the\r\nreceiver and the transmitter and ring the bell. The battery current is\r\nflowing over the line all the time when the receiver is up, but the\r\ntransmitter and the receiver offer so much resistance to its flow that\r\nnot enough current can pass to ring the bell until the resistance is cut\r\nout by short-circuiting them with the push-button.\r\n\r\nThe instruments at both ends of the line should be similar. In\r\nconnecting them together care should be taken to see that the batteries\r\nat each end of the line are arranged so that they are in series and do\r\nnot oppose each other. One side of the line may be a wire, but the\r\nreturn may be the ground, as already explained in the chapter on\r\ntelegraph apparatus.\r\n\r\nA transmitter of the \"desk-stand\" type may be made according to the\r\nscheme shown in Figure 151. It consists simply of a transmitter mounted\r\nupon an upright, and provided with a base so that it may stand on a desk\r\nor a table.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 151.—A Desk-Stand Type of Telephone.]\r\n\r\nIt is also fitted with a hook and a push-button, so that it is a\r\ncomplete telephone instrument with the exception of the bell and the\r\nbattery. The battery and the bell may be located in another place and\r\nconnected to the desk-stand by means of a flexible wire or \"electrical\r\ncord.\"\r\n\r\nFigure 152 shows what is known as a telephone induction coil. Induction\r\ncoils are used in telephone systems whenever it is necessary to work\r\nover a long distance. Such a system is more complicated, and requires\r\nconsiderable care in making the connections, but is far superior to the\r\nsystem just described.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 152.—A Telephone Induction Coil.]\r\n\r\nAn induction coil consists of two fiber or hard-wood heads, about one\r\ninch square and one-quarter of an inch thick, mounted on the ends of an\r\niron core composed of a bundle of small iron wires about two and\r\none-half inches long. The core should be about five-sixteenths of an\r\ninch in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe core is covered with a layer of paper and then wound with three\r\nlayers of No. 22 B. & S. single-cotton-covered wire. These three layers\r\nof wire form the _primary_. The primary is covered with a layer of paper\r\nand then the secondary is wound on. The secondary consists of twelve\r\nlayers of No. 36 B. & S. single-silk-covered magnet wire. It is\r\nadvisable to place a layer of paper between layers of the secondary\r\nwinding, and to give each one a coating of shellac. The two secondary\r\nterminals of the coil are led out through holes in the fiber head and\r\nkept separate from the primary terminals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 153.—Diagram of Connection for a Telephone System\r\nemploying an Induction Coil at each Station.]\r\n\r\nThe wiring diagram of a telephone system using an induction coil at each\r\nstation is shown in Figure 153. The speech sent over a line using an\r\ninduction coil system is much clearer and more easily understood than\r\nthat on a line not using such a device.\r\n\r\nIn building telephone instruments or connecting them up, care and\r\naccuracy will go a long way towards success. Telephony involves some\r\nvery delicate and sensitive vibratory mechanical and electrical actions,\r\nand such instruments must be very carefully made.\r\n\r\n    ² A transmitter is really a microphone built especially to receive\r\n      the sounds of the human voice, and operates on the same principle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII INDUCTION COILS\r\n\r\n\r\nA Medical Coil or shocking coil, as it is properly termed, is nothing\r\nmore or less than a small induction coil, and consists of a core, a\r\nprimary winding, a secondary winding, and an interrupter. The principle\r\nof an induction coil and that of magnetic induction have already been\r\nexplained in Chapter V. It might be well for the readers to turn back to\r\npages 89-91 and reread them.\r\n\r\nThe human body possesses considerable resistance, and the voltage of one\r\nor two ordinary cells of battery is not sufficient to overcome that\r\nresistance and pass enough current through the body to be felt, unless\r\nunder exceptional conditions.\r\n\r\nThe simplest means employable for raising the voltage of a battery high\r\nenough to produce a shock is the medical coil.\r\n\r\nThe first step in making such a coil is to roll up a paper tube,\r\nfive-sixteenths of an inch in diameter inside, and two and one-half\r\ninches long. The outer end of the paper is carefully glued, so that it\r\nwill not unroll. The tube is filled with pieces of iron wire two and\r\none-half inches long which have been straightened by rolling between two\r\nboards. The size of the iron wire may vary from No. 20 to No. 24 B. & S.\r\ngauge. Enough should be slipped into the tube to pack it tightly and\r\nadmit no more.\r\n\r\nA square block, 1 x 1 x 5-16 inches, is cut out of fiber or a\r\nclose-grained hard wood and a hole three-eighths of an inch in diameter\r\nbored through the center. One end of the tube containing the core is\r\nsmeared with glue and slipped into the block. The end of the tube is\r\nallowed to project through about one-sixteenth of an inch. A second\r\nblock, in the form of a circle three-quarters of an inch in diameter,\r\none-quarter of an inch thick, and having a three-eighths of an inch hole\r\nthrough the center, is glued on the opposite end.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 154.—Details of Various Parts of a Medical Coil.]\r\n\r\nAfter the glue has dried, four small holes are drilled in the square\r\nhead in the approximate positions shown by Figure 154. Four layers of\r\nNo. 22 B. & S. gauge magnet wire (it may be either silk or cotton,\r\ndouble or single covered) is wound smoothly and carefully over the core.\r\nThe terminals are led out of the holes _a_ and _b_. The primary is\r\ncovered with two or three layers of paper, and then enough secondary\r\nwound on to bring the total diameter of the coil to about\r\neleven-sixteenths of an inch. The secondary wire must be much finer than\r\nthe primary. It is possible to use any size from No. 32 to No. 36 B. &\r\nS. gauge and obtain good results. The insulation may be either single\r\nsilk or single cotton.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 155.—Details of Interrupter for Medical Coil.]\r\n\r\nThe secondary terminals are led out through the holes _c_ and _d_. It is\r\nperhaps a wise plan to re-enforce these leads with a heavier piece of\r\nwire, because otherwise they are easily broken.\r\n\r\nThe interrupter is a simple arrangement capable of being made in several\r\ndifferent ways. The drawing shows an arrangement which can be improved\r\nupon by any experimenters who are familiar with a medical coil. I have\r\nshown the simplest arrangement, so that all my readers will be able to\r\nbuild it, and those who want to improve it can do so.\r\n\r\nIf a small piece of silver is soldered to the spring and to the\r\ncontact-point it will give better results. The silver is easily secured\r\nby cutting up a ten-cent piece. One terminal of the primary is connected\r\nto the interrupter spring and the other to a binding-post. The\r\ncontact-post is also connected to a binding-post. If a battery is\r\nconnected to the two binding-posts, the current will flow from one post\r\nthrough the coil to the interrupter spring, through the spring to the\r\ncontact post, and thence back to the battery, making a complete circuit.\r\nAs soon as the current flows, however, it produces magnetism which draws\r\nthe spring away from the contact and breaks the circuit, cutting off the\r\nmagnetic pull. The spring flies back to the contact but is drawn forward\r\nagain immediately and repeats the operation continuously at a high rate\r\nof speed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 156.—Completed Medical Coil.]\r\n\r\nThe secondary terminals are led out to two binding-posts to which are\r\nconnected two electrodes or handles by means of flexible wires. The\r\nelectrode may be made of two ordinary flat strips of sheet-metal or a\r\npiece of tubing. In the latter case, the wires may be connected by\r\nwedging them in with a cork. If the handles are grasped while the\r\nbattery is connected to the primary posts and the interrupter is in\r\noperation a powerful shock will be felt. The shock may be regulated from\r\na weak current that can hardly be felt to a very powerful one by\r\nproviding the coil with a piece of iron tubing of about seven-eighths of\r\nan inch inner diameter and two inches long which will slip on and oh the\r\ncoil. When the tube is all the way on, the shock is very mild, and when\r\nall the way off, the shock is very strong. Of course any intermediate\r\nstrength may be secured at stages between the two extremes.\r\n\r\nThe current from medical coils is often prescribed by physicians for\r\nrheumatism and nervous disorders, but must be properly applied. The coil\r\njust described is harmless. It will give a strong shock, but the only\r\nresult is to make the person receiving it drop the handles and not be\r\nanxious to try it again.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpark-Coils\r\n\r\n\r\nA \"spark-coil\" is one of the most interesting pieces of apparatus an\r\nexperimenter can possess. The experiments that may be performed with its\r\naid are varied and many.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of a \"spark-coil\" is to generate enormously high voltages\r\nwhich are able to send sparks across an air space that ordinary currents\r\nof low voltage could not possibly pierce. The spark-coil is the same in\r\nprinciple as the small induction coils used as medical or shocking\r\ncoils, but is made on a larger scale and is provided with a condenser\r\nconnected across the terminals of the interrupter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 157.—Diagram showing Essential Parts of Induction\r\nCoil.]\r\n\r\nIt consists of a central iron core surrounded by a coil of heavy wire\r\ncalled the \"primary,\" and by a second outside winding of wire known as\r\nthe \"secondary.\" The primary is connected to a few cells of battery in\r\nseries with an interrupter. The interrupter makes and breaks the\r\ncircuit, i. e., shuts the current on and off repeatedly.\r\n\r\nEvery time that the current is \"made\" or broken, a high voltage is\r\ninduced in the secondary. By means of the condenser connected across the\r\ninterrupter terminals, the current at \"make\" is caused to take a\r\nconsiderable fraction of time to grow, while at \"break,\" the cessation\r\nis instantaneous. The currents induced in the secondary at break are so\r\npowerful that they leap across the space in a brilliant torrent of\r\nsparks.\r\n\r\n\r\nBuilding a Spark-Coil\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps more attempts are made by experimenters to construct a\r\nspark-coil than any other piece of apparatus, and the results are\r\nusually poor. A spark-coil is not hard to construct, but it requires\r\ncareful work and patience. It is not a job to be finished in a day, but\r\ntime must be liberally expended in its construction. Satisfactory\r\nresults are easily obtained by any one of ordinary mechanical ability if\r\npatience and care are used.\r\n\r\nParts for spark-coils are for sale by many electrical houses, and it is\r\npossible to purchase a set of such machine-made parts for less than the\r\nseparate materials usually cost.\r\n\r\nFor the benefit of those who might wish to build a larger coil than the\r\none described in the following text, a table showing the dimensions of\r\ntwo other sizes will be found.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 158.—Empty Paper Tube, and Tube filled with Core\r\nWire preparatory to winding on the Primary.]\r\n\r\n*The core* is made of very soft iron wire about No. 20 or 22 B. & S.\r\ngauge, cut to exact length. Each piece should be six inches long. Iron\r\nwire may be purchased from electrical supply houses already cut to\r\nvarious lengths for twenty cents a pound. In view of the amount of labor\r\nrequired carefully to cut each piece to length and then straighten it\r\nout so that it will form a neat bundle, it is cheaper to purchase the\r\nwire already cut. Such wire has been annealed, i.e., softened by\r\nbringing to a red heat and then cooling slowly. In case the wire is\r\npurchased at a plumbing shop or a hardware store it must be annealed\r\nbefore it can be used. This is accomplished by tying the wire in a\r\ncompact bundle and placing it in a wood fire where it will grow red-hot.\r\nWhen this stage is reached, cover the wire with ashes and allow the fire\r\nto die away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 159.—Illustrating the Various Steps in winding on\r\nthe Primary and fastening the Ends of the Wire.]\r\n\r\nCut a piece of tough wrapping paper into strips six inches long and\r\nabout five inches wide. Wrap it around a stick or metal rod one-half of\r\nan inch in diameter, so as to form a tube six inches long and having a\r\ndiameter of one-half of an inch. Glue the inside and outside edges of\r\nthe paper so that the tube cannot unroll and then slip it off the stick.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 160.—Complete Primary Winding and Core.]\r\n\r\nFill the tube with the six-inch wires until it is packed tightly and no\r\nmore can be slipped in.\r\n\r\n*The primary* consists of two layers of No. 18 B. & S. gauge\r\ncotton-covered wire wound over the core for a distance of five inches.\r\nOne-half pound of wire is more than enough for one primary. The wire\r\nmust be wound on very smoothly and carefully. In order to fasten the\r\ninside end so that it will not become loose, place a short piece of tape\r\nlengthwise of the core and wind on two or three turns over it. Then\r\ndouble the end back and complete the winding. After the first layer is\r\nfinished, give it a coat of shellac and wind on the second layer. The\r\nend of the wire is wound with a piece of tape and fastened by slipping\r\nthrough a loop of tape embedded under the last few turns. The\r\nillustrations will explain more clearly just how this is accomplished.\r\nThe second layer is then given a coat of shellac and allowed to dry.\r\nAfter it is dry, wrap about fifteen layers of paper which have been\r\nsoaked in paraffin around the primary. This operation should be\r\nperformed in a warm place, over a fire or lighted lamp where the\r\nparaffin may be kept soft, so that the paper will go on tightly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 161.—The Primary covered with Insulating Layer of\r\nPaper ready for the Secondary.]\r\n\r\nThe coil is now ready to receive the secondary winding. The core and\r\nprimary which have been described are suit-able for a secondary giving\r\nsparks from one-half to three-fourths of an inch long.\r\n\r\n*The secondary* winding consists of several thousand turns of very fine\r\nwire wound on in smooth even layers with paper between each two layers.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the size and amount of wire required. In\r\naddition, about two pounds of paraffin and a pad of linen paper or\r\ntypewriter paper will be required. The wire may be either enamel,\r\ncotton, or silk insulated. Single silk-covered wire is preferred.\r\n\r\n\r\n   ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n   SIZE OF COIL           SIZE OF WIRE            AMOUNT\r\n   ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n   1/2 inch               36 B. & S.              10 ounces\r\n   ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n   1 inch                 34 B. & S.              1 lb.\r\n   ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n   1/2 inch               34 B. & S.              2 lbs.\r\n   ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n\r\n\r\nThe means for supporting and turning the coil in order to wind on the\r\nsecondary may be left somewhat to the ingenuity of the young\r\nexperimenter. The following suggestion, however, is one which experience\r\nhas proved to be well worth following out, and may be applied to other\r\nthings than the construction of an induction coil. It seems to be the\r\nnature of most boys, for some reason or other, to be unwilling to spend\r\ntime and labor on anything which will aid them in their work. They are\r\nalways in such a hurry and so anxious to see something completed that\r\nthey direct all their energy to that end rather than spend part of their\r\ntime in constructing some little device which would really lighten the\r\nother work and go a long way towards insuring its successful completion.\r\n\r\nI have frequently given instructions for building an induction coil and\r\nplaced particular stress upon winding the secondary, only to have such\r\nsuggestions ignored in the anxious endeavor of boys to finish the coil\r\nas soon as possible. In every such instance the coil has been a failure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 162.—Simple Winding Device for winding the\r\nSecondary.]\r\n\r\nThe illustration shows a simple form of winder, with which the operation\r\nof winding the secondary is a very slow one, but, on the other hand, it\r\nis possible to do very accurate, careful winding with the aid of such a\r\ndevice. The parts may all be made from wood.\r\n\r\nThe chucks fit tightly over the ends of the core so that when the handle\r\nis turned, the coil will revolve also. The spring serves to keep the\r\nchucks snugly against the coil ends, so that they will not slip.\r\n\r\nFrom one-half to five-eighths of a pound of wire will be required to\r\nwind the coil. A large number of strips of thin paraffined or waxed\r\npaper must be cut five inches wide. The inside terminal, or \"beginning\"\r\nend of the wire is tied around the insulating tube near the left-hand\r\nend. The spool of wire must be placed in a position where it will\r\nrevolve freely without strain on the wire. No. 36 is very fine and\r\neasily broken, so use the utmost care to guard against this mishap.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 163.—Completed Secondary Winding.]\r\n\r\nWind on a smooth, even layer of wire, permitting each turn to touch the\r\nother, but none to lap over. Carry the winding to within one-half inch\r\nof the ends of the insulating tube and then wind on two layers of the\r\nwaxed paper.\r\n\r\nThe paper must be put on smoothly and evenly, so as to afford a firm\r\nfoundation for the next layer. The wire is wrapped around with the\r\npaper, so that the next layer starts one-half inch from the edge. A\r\nsecond layer is then wound on very carefully, stopping when it comes\r\none-half inch from the edge. Two more layers of paper are put on, and\r\nthe process repeated, alternately winding on paper and wire until the\r\nstated quantity of the latter has been used up. The layers of wire may\r\noccasionally be given a coating of shellac. This is a good insulator,\r\nand will serve to hold them together and prevent the wire from becoming\r\nloose.\r\n\r\nIn winding the coil, remember that if at any point you allow the winding\r\nto become irregular or uneven, the irregularity will be much exaggerated\r\non the succeeding layers. For this reason, do not allow any to occur. If\r\nthe wire tends to go on unevenly, wrap an extra layer of thick paper\r\naround underneath so as to offer a smooth foundation, and you will find\r\nthe difficulty remedied.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 164.—Interrupter Parts.]\r\n\r\nAn efficient vibrator for a coil cannot be easily made, and it is best\r\nto buy one which is already fitted with platinum points. The interrupter\r\nwill play a very important part in the successful working of the coil,\r\nand its arrangement and construction are important. Interrupters like\r\nthat shown in the illustration and used for automobile will be found the\r\nbest.\r\n\r\nThe condenser may be home-made. It consists of alternate sheets of\r\ntinfoil and paraffined paper, arranged in a pile as shown in the\r\nillustration. The following table gives the proper sizes for condensers\r\nfor three different coils.\r\n\r\n\r\n   ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n                            TINFOIL\r\n   SIZE OF SPARK-COIL     ───────────────────────────────────────────\r\n                            NO.

The alternate sheets of tinfoil, that is, all on\r\none side and all on the other, are connected.\r\n\r\nThe condenser is connected directly across the terminals of the\r\ninterrupter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 165.—Condenser.]\r\n\r\nThere are various methods of mounting a coil, the most common being to\r\nplace it in a box with the interrupter at one end. Perhaps, however, one\r\nof the neatest and also the simplest methods is to mount it in the\r\nmanner shown in the illustration.\r\n\r\nThe end-pieces are cut out of wood. No specific dimensions can be given,\r\nbecause the diameter of the coils will vary somewhat according to who\r\nwinds them and how tightly they are made. The coil is enclosed in a tube\r\nmade by rolling up a strip of cardboard and then giving it a coat of\r\nshellac. The tube may be covered by a strip of black cloth, so as to\r\nimprove its appearance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 166.—Completed Coil.]\r\n\r\nThe vibrator is mounted on the end. The core projects through a hole in\r\nthe wood near the end of the vibrator spring so that the latter will be\r\ndrawn in by the magnetism of the core when the current flows. The\r\ncondenser may be placed in the hollow box which forms the base of the\r\ncoil.\r\n\r\nThe secondary terminals of the coil are mounted on a small strip of wood\r\nbridging the two coil ends.\r\n\r\nOne terminal of the primary is connected to a binding-post mounted on\r\nthe base, and the other led to the vibrator spring. The vibrator yoke is\r\nconnected to a second binding-post on the base. One terminal of the\r\ncondenser is connected to the spring, and the other to the yoke.\r\n\r\nFour cells of dry battery should be sufficient to run the coil and cause\r\nit to give a good one-half-inch spark if built according to the\r\ndirections here given. The vibrator or interrupter will require\r\nadjusting and a position of the adjusting screw will soon be found where\r\nthe coil works best.\r\n\r\n\r\nExperiments with a Spark-Coil\r\n\r\n\r\n*Electrical Hands.* Many extraordinary and interesting experiments may\r\nbe performed with the aid of a spark-coil.\r\n\r\nThe following experiment never fails to amuse a party of friends, and is\r\nmystifying and weird to the ordinary person, unacquainted with the\r\nsecret of its operation.\r\n\r\nFigure 167 shows the arrangement of the apparatus. The primary of an\r\nordinary one-inch spark induction coil is connected in series with a\r\ntwelve-volt battery and telephone transmitter. A small switch is\r\nincluded in the circuit to break the current and prevent needless waste\r\nof the battery when the apparatus is not in immediate use. The secondary\r\nterminals of the induction coil are led by means of an insulated wire to\r\nthe adjoining room where they terminate in a pair of scissors, or some\r\nother small metallic object which may be clasped in the hand.\r\n\r\nEach of two persons, wearing dry shoes or rubber-soled slippers, grasps\r\nthe terminal of one wire in one hand. The other hand is placed flat\r\nagainst the ear of a third person, with a piece of dry linen paper\r\nintervening between the hands and the head. If a fourth person, in the\r\nroom where the induction coil is located, then closes the small switch\r\nand speaks into the telephone transmitter, the person against whose ears\r\nthe hands are being held will hear the speech very distinctly. The\r\nticking of a watch held against the mouthpiece of the transmitter will\r\nbe heard with startling clearness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 167.—Diagram showing how to connect the Apparatus\r\nfor the \"Electric Hands\" Experiment.]\r\n\r\nThe principle governing the operation of the apparatus is very simple.\r\nAlmost every experimenter is familiar with the ordinary electrical\r\ncondenser, which consists of alternate sheets of paraffined paper and\r\ntinfoil. When this is connected to a source of electricity of high\r\npotential, but not enough so as to puncture the paper dielectric, the\r\nalternate sheets of tinfoil will become oppositely charged and attract\r\neach other. If the circuit is then broken the sheets will lose their\r\ncharge and also their attraction for one another. If the tinfoil sheets\r\nand paper are not pressed tightly together, there will be a slight\r\nmovement of the tinfoil and paper which will correspond in frequency to\r\nany fluctuations of the charging current which may take place.\r\n\r\nThe head of the third person and the hands held against his head act\r\nlike three tinfoil sheets of a condenser, separated by two sheets of\r\npaper. The words spoken in the transmitter cause the current to\r\nfluctuate and the induction coil raises the potential of the current\r\nsufficiently to charge the condenser and cause a slight vibration of the\r\npaper dielectric. The vibrations correspond in strength and speed to\r\nthose of the voice, and so the words spoken in the transmitter are\r\naudible to the person over whose ears the paper is pressed.\r\n\r\nEverything about the apparatus must be as dry as possible, to insure its\r\nsuccessful operation. The people holding the wires in their hands should\r\nstand on a carpeted floor. Always be very careful to tighten the\r\nadjusting screw and block the interrupter on the coil, so that by no\r\nmeans can it possibly commence to operate, or the person listening,\r\ninstead of \"hearing things\" will become the victim of a rather painful,\r\npractical joke.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeissler Tubes\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most beautiful and surprising effects may be obtained by lighting\r\nGeissler tubes with a coil. The tubes are made in intricate and varied\r\npatterns of special glass, containing fluorescent minerals and salts,\r\nand are filled with different rarefied gases. When the tubes are\r\nconnected to the secondary of a spark-coil by means of a wire fastened\r\nto the little rings at the end, and the coil is set in operation, they\r\nlight up in the most wonderful way imaginable. The rarefied gases and\r\nminerals in the glass throw out beautiful iridescent colors, lighting up\r\na dark room with a weird flickering light. Every tube is usually of a\r\ndifferent pattern and has a combination of different colors. The most\r\nbeautiful tubes are those provided with a double wall containing a\r\nfluorescent liquid, which heightens the color effects when the tube is\r\nlighted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 168.—Geissler Tubes.]\r\n\r\nEight to ten tubes may be lighted at once on an ordinary coil by\r\nconnecting them in series.\r\n\r\n\r\nGhost Light\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you grasp the bulb of an old incandescent electric lamp in one hand\r\nand touch the base to one side of the secondary when the coil is in\r\noperation the bulb will emit a peculiar greenish light in the dark.\r\n\r\n\r\nPuncturing Paper\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you place a piece of heavy paper or cardboard between two sharp wires\r\nconnected to the secondary of a spark-coil and start the coil working,\r\nthe paper will be pierced.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Practical Joke\r\n\r\n\r\nThis action of the coil may be made the basis of an amusing joke. Offer\r\na friend who may smoke cigarettes some cigarette paper which has been\r\nprepared in the following way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 169.—The Bulb will emit a Peculiar Greenish Light.]\r\n\r\nPlace several sheets of the paper on a piece of sheet-metal which is\r\nconnected to one side of the secondary. By means of an insulated handle\r\nso that you will not get a shock, move the other wire all over the\r\nsurface of the cigarette paper. The paper will be pierced with numerous\r\nfine holes which are so fine that they can hardly be seen.\r\n\r\nIf your friend uses any of the paper in making a cigarette and tries to\r\nlight it he will waste a box of matches without being able to get one\r\ngood puff, because the little invisible holes in the paper will spoil\r\nthe draft. Perhaps he may quit smoking altogether.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Electric Garbage-can\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 170.—An Electrified Garbage-can.]\r\n\r\nIf there are any dogs in your neighborhood that have a habit of\r\nextracting things from your ash-barrel or garbage-can, place the latter\r\non a piece of dry wood. Lead a well insulated wire from one secondary\r\nterminal of your coil to the can. Ground the other secondary terminal.\r\nIf you see a dog with his nose in the can press your key and start the\r\ncoil working. It will not hurt the dog, but he will get the surprise of\r\nhis life. He will go for home as fast as he can travel and will not\r\ntouch that particular can again, even if it should contain some of the\r\nchoicest canine delicacies.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhotographing an Electric Discharge\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following experiment must be conducted in a dark room with the aid\r\nof a ruby photographic lamp, as otherwise the plates used would become\r\nlightstruck and spoiled.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 171.—Jacob’s Ladder.]\r\n\r\nPlaced an ordinary photographic plate on a piece of sheet-metal with the\r\ncoated side of the plate upwards. Connect one of the secondary terminals\r\nof the spark-coil to the piece of sheet-metal.\r\n\r\nThen sift a thin film of dry starch powder, sulphur, or talcum through a\r\npiece of fine gauze on the plate. Lead a sharp-pointed wire from the\r\nother secondary terminal of the coil to the center of the plate and then\r\npush the key just long enough to make one spark.\r\n\r\nWipe the powder off the plate and develop it in the usual manner of\r\nfilms and plates. If you cannot do developing yourself, place the plate\r\nback in its box and send it to some friend, or to a photographer.\r\n\r\nThe result will be a negative showing a peculiar electric discharge,\r\nsomewhat like sea-moss in appearance. No two such photographs will be\r\nalike and the greatest variety of new designs, etc., imaginable may be\r\nproduced in this manner.\r\n\r\n\r\nJacob’s Ladder\r\n\r\n\r\nTake two pieces of bare copper wire about eight inches long and bend\r\nthem at right angles. Place them in the secondary terminals of a\r\nspark-coil as in Figure 171. Bend them so that the vertical portions are\r\nabout one-half of an inch apart at the bottom and one inch apart at the\r\ntop. Start the coil working, and the sparks will run up the wires from\r\nthe bottom to the top and appear very much like the rungs in a ladder.\r\n\r\n\r\nX-Rays\r\n\r\n\r\nMost young experimenters are unaware what a wonderful and interesting\r\nfield is open to the possessor of a small X-ray tube.\r\n\r\nSmall X-ray tubes which will operate satisfactorily on an inch and\r\none-half spark-coil may be obtained from several electrical supply\r\nhouses. They usually cost about four dollars and a half. With such a\r\ntube and a _fluoroscope_ it is possible to see the bones in the human\r\nhand, the contents of a closed purse, etc.\r\n\r\nThe tube is made of glass and contains a very high vacuum. The long end\r\nof the tube contains a platinum electrode called the _cathode_. The\r\nshort end contains two electrodes called _anodes_, one perpendicular to\r\nthe tube and the other diagonal.\r\n\r\nThe tube is usually clamped in a wooden holder called an X-ray tube\r\nstand. The tube should be so adjusted that the X-rays which are\r\nreflected from the diagonal anode will pass off in the direction shown\r\nby the dotted lines in Figure 174.\r\n\r\nThe fluoroscope is a cone-shaped wooden box fitted with a screen\r\ncomposed of a sheet of paper covered with crystals of a chemical called\r\nplatinum-barium-cyanide.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 172.—An X-Ray Tube.]\r\n\r\nThe opposite end of the box is fitted with a covering of felt or velvet\r\nwhich shuts off the light around the eyes and nose when you look into\r\nthe fluoroscope and hold it tightly against the face.\r\n\r\nA fluoroscope may be purchased complete, or the platinum-barium-cyanide\r\nscreen purchased separately and mounted on a box as shown in Figure 173.\r\n\r\nThe two anodes of the tube should be connected, and led to one terminal\r\nof a spark-coil capable of giving a spark at least one and one-half\r\ninches long. Another wire should be led from the cathode of the tube to\r\nthe other terminal of the coil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 173.—Fluoroscope.]\r\n\r\nWhen it is desired to inspect any object, such as the hand, it must be\r\nheld close to the screen of the fluoroscope and placed between the\r\nlatter and the tube in the path of the X-rays. The X-rays are thrown\r\nforth from the tube at an angle of 45 degrees from the diagonal anode.\r\n\r\nLook into the fluoroscope and it should appear to be filled with a green\r\nlight. If not, the battery terminals connected to the primary of the\r\ncoil should be reversed, so as to send the current through in the\r\nopposite direction.\r\n\r\nThe X-rays will cause the chemicals on the screen to light up and give\r\nforth a peculiar green light. If the hand is held against the screen,\r\nbetween the screen and the tube, the X-rays will pass through the hand\r\nand cast a shadow on the screen. They do not pass through the bones as\r\neasily as they do through the flesh and so will cast a shadow of the\r\nbones in the hand on the screen, and if you look closely you will be\r\nable to see the various joints, etc. The interrupter on the coil should\r\nbe carefully adjusted so that the light does not flicker too much.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 174.—How to connect an X-Ray Tube to a Spark-Coil.]\r\n\r\nIf it is desired to take X-ray pictures, a fluoroscope is unnecessary.\r\n\r\nTurn the tube around so that the X-rays point downward.\r\n\r\nShut the battery current off so that the tube is not in operation until\r\neverything else is ready.\r\n\r\nPlace an ordinary photographic plate, contained in an ordinary\r\nplate-holder, directly under the tube with the gelatin side of the plate\r\nupwards.\r\n\r\nPlace the hand flat on the plate and lower the tube until it is only\r\nabout three inches above the hand. Then start the coil working so that\r\nthe tube lights up and permit it to run for about fifteen minutes\r\nwithout removing the hand. Then turn the current off and develop the\r\nplate in a dark room.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to obtain a very good X-ray photograph of the hand in\r\nthis manner. Photographs showing the skeleton of a mouse, nails in a\r\nboard, coins in a purse, a bullet in a piece of wood, etc., are a few of\r\nthe other objects which make interesting pictures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: An X-Ray Photograph of the hand taken with the Outfit\r\nshown in Figure 174. The arrows point to injuries to the bone of the\r\nthird finger near the middle Joint Resulting in a Stiff Joint.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII TRANSFORMERS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn most towns and cities where electricity for light and power is\r\ncarried over long distances, it will be noticed that small iron boxes\r\nare fastened to the poles at frequent intervals, usually wherever there\r\nis a group of houses or buildings supplied with the current. Many boys\r\nknow that the boxes contain \"transformers,\" but do not quite understand\r\nexactly what their purpose is, and how they are constructed.\r\n\r\nWhen it is desired to convey electrical energy to a distance, for the\r\npurpose of producing either light or power, one of the chief problems to\r\nbe faced is, how to reduce to a minimum any possible waste or loss of\r\nenergy during its transmission. Furthermore, since wires and cables of\r\nlarge size are very costly, it is desirable that they be as small as\r\npossible and yet still be able to carry the current without undue\r\nlosses.\r\n\r\nIt has already been explained that wires offer resistance to an\r\nelectrical current, and that some of the energy is lost in passing\r\nthrough a wire because of this resistance. Small wires possess more\r\nresistance than large ones, and if small wires are to be used, in order\r\nto save on the cost of the transmission line, the loss of energy will be\r\ngreater, necessitating some method of partially reducing or overcoming\r\nthis fault.\r\n\r\nIn order to explain clearly how the problem is solved, the electric\r\ncurrent may for the moment be compared to a stream of water flowing\r\nthrough a pipe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 175.—Comparison between Electric Current and Flow of\r\nWater.]\r\n\r\nThe illustration shows two pipes, a small one and a large one, each\r\nsupposed to be connected to the same tank, so that the pressure in each\r\nis equal, and it is clearly apparent that more water will flow out of\r\nthe large one than out of the small one. If ten gallons of water flow\r\nout of the large pipe in one minute, it may be possible that the\r\ncomparative sizes of the pipes are such that only one gallon of water\r\nwill flow out of the small one in the same length of time.\r\n\r\nBut in case it should be necessary or desirable to get ten gallons of\r\nwater a minute out of a small pipe such as _B_, what could be done to\r\naccomplish it?\r\n\r\nThe pressure could be increased. The water would then be able better to\r\novercome the resistance of the small pipe.\r\n\r\nThis is exactly what is done in the distribution of electric currents\r\nfor power and lighting. The pressure or potential is increased to a\r\nvalue where it can overcome the resistance of the small wires.\r\n\r\nBut unfortunately it rarely happens that electrical power can be\r\nutilized at high pressure for ordinary purposes. For instance, 110 volts\r\nis usually the maximum pressure required by incandescent lamps, whereas\r\nthe pressure on the line wires issuing from the power-house is generally\r\n2,200 volts or more.\r\n\r\nSuch a high voltage is hard to insulate, and would kill most people\r\ncoming into contact with the lines, and is otherwise dangerous.\r\n\r\nBefore the current enters a house, therefore, some apparatus is\r\nnecessary, which is capable of reducing this high pressure to a value\r\nwhere it may be safely employed.\r\n\r\nThis is the duty performed by the \"transformer\" enclosed in the black\r\niron box fastened on the top of the electric light poles about the\r\nstreets.\r\n\r\nIf a transformer were to be defined it might be said to be a device for\r\nchanging the voltage and current of an _Alternating_ circuit in pressure\r\nand amount.\r\n\r\nThe word, _alternating_, has been placed in italics because it is only\r\nupon alternating currents that a transformer may be successfully\r\nemployed. Therein, also, lies the reason why alternating current is\r\nsupplied in some cases instead of direct current. It makes possible the\r\nuse of transformers for lowering the voltage at the point of service.\r\n\r\nMany boys possessing electrical toys and apparatus operating upon direct\r\ncurrent only, have bemoaned the fact that the lighting system in their\r\ntown furnished alternating current. Very often in the case of small\r\ncities or towns one power-house furnishes the current for several\r\ncommunities and the energy has to be carried a considerable distance.\r\nAlternating current is then usually employed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 176.—Alternating Current System for Light and\r\nPower.]\r\n\r\nThe illustration shows the general method of arranging such a system. A\r\nlarge dynamo located at the power-house generates alternating current.\r\nThe alternating current passes into a \"step-up\" transformer which raises\r\nthe potential to 2,200 volts (approximately). It is then possible to use\r\nmuch smaller line wires, and to transmit the energy with smaller loss\r\nthan if the current were sent out at the ordinary dynamo voltage. The\r\ncurrent passes over the wires at this high voltage, but wherever\r\nconnection is established with a house or other building, the \"service\"\r\nwires which supply the house are not connected directly to the line\r\nwires, but to a a \"step-down\" transformer which lowers the potential of\r\nthe current flowing into the house to about 110 volts.\r\n\r\nIn larger cities where the demand for current in a given area is much\r\ngreater than that in a small town, a somewhat different method of\r\ndistributing the energy is employed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 177.—Motor Generator Set for changing Alternating\r\nCurrent to Direct Current.]\r\n\r\nThe alternating current generated by the huge dynamos at the \"central\"\r\nstation is passed into a set of transformers which in some cases raise\r\nthe potential as high as five or six thousand volts. The current is then\r\nsent out over cables or \"feeders\" to various \"sub\" stations, or\r\n\"converter\" stations, located in various parts of the city. Here the\r\ncurrent is first sent through a set of step-down transformers which\r\nreduce the potential to the approximate value originally generated by\r\nthe dynamos. It then passes into the \"rotary converters\" which change\r\nthe alternating current into direct current after which it is sent by\r\nunderground cables direct to the consumers in the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nA transformer in its simplest form consists of two independent coils of\r\nwire wound upon an iron ring. When an alternating current is passed\r\nthrough one of the coils, known as the primary, it produces a magnetic\r\nfield which induces a current of electricity in the other, or secondary,\r\ncoil.\r\n\r\nThe potential or voltage of the current in the secondary is in nearly\r\nthe same ratio to the potential of the current passed into the primary\r\nas the number of turns in the secondary is to the number of turns in the\r\nprimary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 178.—Step-Up Transformer.]\r\n\r\nKnowing this, it is very easy to arrange a transformer to \"step\" the\r\npotential up or down as desired. The transformer in Figure 178\r\nrepresents a \"step-up\" transformer having ten turns of wire on the\r\nprimary and twenty turns on the secondary. If an alternating current of\r\n10 volts and 2 amperes is passed into the primary, the secondary winding\r\nwill double the potential, since it has twice as many turns as the\r\nprimary and the current delivered by the secondary will be approximately\r\n20 volts and 1 ampere.\r\n\r\nThe action may be very easily reversed and a \"step-down\" transformer\r\narranged by placing twenty turns of wire on the primary and ten turns on\r\nthe secondary. If a current of 20 volts and 1 ampere is passed into the\r\nprimary, the secondary will deliver a current of only 10 volts and 2\r\namperes, since it contains only half as many turns.\r\n\r\nA circular ring of iron wire wound with two coils would in many respects\r\nbe somewhat difficult to construct, and so the iron core is usually\r\nbuilt in the form of a hollow rectangle and formed of sheets of iron.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 179.—Step-Down Transformer.]\r\n\r\nIt is often desirable to have at hand an alternating current of low\r\nvoltage for experimental purposes. Such a current may be used for\r\noperating induction coils, motors, lamps, toy railways, etc., and is\r\nquite as satisfactory as direct current for many purposes, with the\r\npossible exception of electro-plating and storage-battery charging, for\r\nwhich it cannot be used.\r\n\r\nWhen the supply is drawn from the 110-volt lighting circuit and passed\r\nthrough a small \"step-down\" transformer, the alternating current is not\r\nonly cheaper but more convenient. A transformer of about 100 watts\r\ncapacity, capable of delivering a current of 10 volts and 10 amperes\r\nfrom the secondary will not draw more than approximately one ampere from\r\nthe 110-volt circuit. This current is only equal to that consumed by two\r\nordinary 16-candle-power lamps or one of 32 candle-power, making it\r\npossible to operate the transformer to its full capacity for about one\r\ncent an hour. A further advantage is the fact that a \"step-down\"\r\ntransformer enables the small boy to use the lighting current for\r\noperating electrical toys without danger of receiving a shock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 180.—Core Dimensions.]\r\n\r\nThe transformer described in the following pages can be easily built by\r\nany boy at all familiar with tools, and should make a valuable addition\r\nto his electrical equipment, provided that the directions are carefully\r\nfollowed and pains are taken to make the insulation perfect.\r\n\r\nThe capacity of the transformer is approximately 100 watts. The\r\ndimensions and details of construction described and illustrated are\r\nthose of a transformer intended for use upon a lighting current of 110\r\nvolts and 60-cycles frequency. The frequency of most alternating current\r\nsystems is 25, 60, or 120 cycles. The most common frequency is 60.\r\nDimensions and particulars of transformers for 25 and 120 cycles will be\r\nfound in the form of a table farther on.\r\n\r\nThe frequency of your light circuit may be ascertained by inquiring of\r\nthe company supplying the power.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 181.—The Core, Assembled and Taped.]\r\n\r\nThe first part to be considered in the construction of a transformer is\r\nthe core. The core is made up of thin sheet-iron strips of the\r\ndimensions shown in Figure 180. The iron may be secured from almost any\r\nhardware store or plumbing shop by ordering \"stove-pipe iron.\" Have the\r\niron cut into strips 1 1/4 inches wide and 24 inches long. Then, using a\r\npair of tinner’s shears, cut the long strips into pieces 3 inches and 4\r\n3/4 inches long until you have enough to make a pile of each 2 1/2\r\ninches high when they are stacked up neatly and compressed. The long\r\nstrips are used to form the \"legs\" of the core, and the short ones the\r\n\"yokes.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 182.—Transformer Leg.]\r\n\r\nThe strips are assembled according to the diagram shown in Figure 180.\r\nThe alternate ends overlap and form a hollow rectangle 4 1/4 x 6 inches.\r\nThe core should be pressed tightly together and the legs bound with\r\nthree or four layers of insulating tape preparatory to winding on the\r\nprimary. After the legs are bound, the yoke pieces may be pulled out,\r\nleaving the legs intact.\r\n\r\nFour fiber heads, 2 1/2 inches square and 1/8 of an inch thick, are made\r\nas shown in Figure 183. A square hole 1 1/4 x 1 1/4 inches is cut in the\r\ncenter. Two of these are placed on each of the assembled legs as shown\r\nin Figure 184.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 183.—Fiber Head.]\r\n\r\nThe primary winding consists of one thousand turns of No. 20 B. & S.\r\ngauge single-cotton-covered magnet wire. Five hundred turns are wound on\r\neach leg of the transformer. The wire should be wound on very smoothly\r\nand evenly with a layer of shellacked paper between each layer of wire.\r\n\r\nThe two legs should be connected in series. The terminals are protected\r\nand insulated by covering with some insulating tape rolled up in the\r\nform of a tube.\r\n\r\nThe secondary winding consists of one hundred turns of No. 10 B. & S.\r\ngauge double-cotton-covered wire. Fifty turns are wound on each leg,\r\nover the primary, several layers of paper being placed between the two.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 184.—Leg with Heads in Position for Winding.]\r\n\r\nA \"tap\" is brought out at every ten turns. The taps are made by\r\nsoldering a narrow strip of sheet-copper to the wire at proper\r\nintervals. Care must be taken to insulate each joint and tap with a\r\nsmall strip of insulating tape so that there is no danger of a short\r\ncircuit being formed between adjacent turns.\r\n\r\nAfter the winding is completed the transformer is ready for assembling.\r\nThe yoke pieces of the core should be slipped into position and the\r\nwhole carefully lined up. The transformer itself is now ready for\r\nmounting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 185.—How to make a Tap in the Primary by soldering a\r\nCopper Strip to the Wire.]\r\n\r\nThe base-board measures 11 x 7 3/4 x 7/8 inches. It is shown in Figure\r\n192.\r\n\r\nThe transformer rests upon two wooden strips, _A_ and _B_, 4 1/4 inches\r\nlong, 1 1/4 inches wide, and 3/4 of an inch high. The strips are nailed\r\nto the base so that they will come under the ends of the core outside of\r\nthe fiber heads.\r\n\r\nThe transformer is held to the base by two tie-rods passing through a\r\nstrip, _C_, 6 inches long, one-half of an inch thick and three-quarters\r\nof an inch wide. The strip rests on the ends of the core. The tie-rods\r\nare fastened on the under side of the base by means of a nut and washer\r\non the ends. When the nuts are screwed up tightly, the cross-piece will\r\npull the transformer firmly down to the base.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 186.—The Transformer completely Wound and ready for\r\nAssembling.]\r\n\r\nThe regulating switches, two in number, are mounted on the lower part of\r\nthe base. The contact points and the arm are cut out of sheet-brass,\r\none-eighth of an inch thick. It is unnecessary to go into the details of\r\ntheir construction, because the dimensions are plainly shown in Figure\r\n188.\r\n\r\nThe contacts are drilled out and countersunk so that they may be\r\nfastened to the base with small flat-headed wood screws.\r\n\r\nEach switch-arm is fitted with a small rubber knob to serve as a handle.\r\nThe arm works on a small piece of brass of exactly the same thickness as\r\nthe switch-points. Care must be taken that the points and this washer\r\nare all exactly in line, so that the arm will make good contact with\r\neach point. There are five points to each switch, as shown in Figure\r\n190.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 187.—Wooden Strips for mounting the Transformer on\r\nthe Base.]\r\n\r\nThe switch, _D_, is arranged so that each step cuts in or out twenty\r\nturns of the secondary, the first point being connected with the end of\r\nthe winding. The second point connects with the first tap, the third\r\ncontact with the second tap, the fourth contact with the third tap, and\r\nthe fifth contact with the fourth tap.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 188.—Details of the Switch Parts.]\r\n\r\nThe switch, _E_, is arranged so that each step cuts in or out five\r\nturns. The contacts on this switch are numbered in the reverse\r\ndirection. The fifth contact of switch _D_, and the fifth contact of\r\nswitch _E_, are connected together. The fourth contact is connected to\r\nthe fifth tap, the third contact to the sixth tap, the second contact to\r\nthe seventh, and the first contact to the end of the winding.\r\n\r\nThis arrangement makes it possible to secure any voltage from one-half\r\nto ten in one-half-volt steps from the secondary of the machine. Each\r\nstep on the switch, _D_, will give two volts, while those on _E_ will\r\neach give one-half of a volt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 189.—The Complete Switch.]\r\n\r\nTwo binding-posts (marked _P_ and _P_ in the drawing) mounted in the\r\nupper corners of the base are connected to the terminals of the primary\r\nwinding. The two posts in the lower corners (marked _S_ and _S_ in the\r\ndrawing) are connected to the switch levers, and are the posts from\r\nwhich the secondary or low voltage is obtained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 190.—Diagram of Connections.]\r\n\r\nThe transformer may be connected to the 110-V. alternating current\r\ncircuit by means of an attachment plug and cord. One end of the cord is\r\nplaced in each of the primary binding-posts. The other end of the cord\r\nis connected to the attachment plug so that the latter may be screwed\r\ninto any convenient electric-light socket.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 191.—Top View of the Transformer.]\r\n\r\nThe transformer must not be connected directly to the line. An\r\ninstrument such as this is not designed for continuous service and is\r\nintended to be disconnected as soon as you are through using it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 192.—Side View of the Transformer.]\r\n\r\nIt will be found a great convenience in operating many of the electrical\r\ndevices described, wherever direct current is not essential.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIV WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\nProbably no branch of electrical science ever appealed more to the\r\nimagination of the experimenter than that coming under the heading of\r\nwireless telegraphy. Wherever you go, you are likely to see the\r\near-marks of _amateur_ wireless telegraph stations in the aerials and\r\nmasts set up in trees and on house-tops. It is estimated that there are\r\nnearly a quarter of a million such stations in the United States.\r\n\r\nThere is really no great mystery about this wonderful art which made\r\npossible the instantaneous transmission of messages over immense\r\ndistances without any apparent physical connection save that of the\r\nearth, air, or water.\r\n\r\nDid you ever throw a stone in a pool of water? As soon as the stone\r\nstruck, little waves spread out from the spot in gradually enlarging\r\ncircles until they reached the shore or died away.\r\n\r\nBy throwing several stones in succession, with varying intervals of time\r\nbetween them, it would be possible so to arrange a set of signals, that\r\nthey would convey a meaning to a second person standing on the opposite\r\nshore of the pool.\r\n\r\nWireless telegraphy is based upon the principle of _creating and\r\ndetecting_ waves in a great _pool_ of ether.\r\n\r\nModern scientists suppose that all space is filled with an \"imaginary\"\r\nsubstance called _ether_. The ether is invisible, odorless, and\r\npractically weightless. This ether, however, bears no relation to the\r\nanaesthetic of that name which is used in surgical operations.\r\n\r\nIt surrounds and penetrates all substances and all space.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 193.—Little Waves spread out from the Spot.]\r\n\r\nIt exists in a vacuum and in solid rocks. Since the ether does not make\r\nitself apparent to any of our physical senses, some of these statements\r\nmay seem contradictory. Its definite existence cannot be proved except\r\nby reasoning, but by accepting and imagining its reality, it is possible\r\nto understand and explain many scientific puzzles.\r\n\r\nA good instance is offered by the sun. Light and heat can be shown to\r\nconsist of extremely rapid vibrations. That fact can be proved. The sun\r\nis over 90,000,000 miles away from our earth and yet light and heat come\r\nstreaming down to us through a space that is devoid even of air.\r\nSomething must exist as a medium to transmit these vibrations; it is the\r\nether.\r\n\r\nLet us consider again the pool of water. The waves or ripples caused by\r\nthrowing in the stone are vibrations of the water. The distance between\r\ntwo adjacent ripples is called the _wave length_.\r\n\r\nThe distances between two vibrations of light can also be _measured_.\r\nThey are so small, however, that they may be spoken of only in\r\n_thousandths_ of an inch. The waves created in the ether by wireless\r\ntelegraph apparatus are the same as those of light except that their\r\nlength usually varies from 75 to 9,000 _feet_ instead of a fraction of a\r\nthousandth of an inch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 194.—A Simple Transmitter.]\r\n\r\n*A Simple Transmitter* is illustrated in Figure 194. A telegraph key is\r\nconnected in series with a set of cells and the _primary_ of an\r\ninduction coil, which, it will be remembered, is simply a coil\r\nconsisting of a few turns of wire. This induces a high voltage in a\r\nsecond coil consisting of a larger number of turns and called the\r\n_secondary_.\r\n\r\nThe terminals of the secondary are led to a spark-gap—an arrangement\r\ncomposed of two polished brass balls, separated by a small air-gap. One\r\nof the balls, in turn, is connected to a metal plate buried in the\r\nearth, and the other to a network of wires suspended high in the air and\r\ninsulated from all surrounding objects.\r\n\r\nWhen the key at the transmitter is pressed, the battery current flows\r\nthrough the primary of the induction coil and generates in the secondary\r\na current of very high voltage, 20,000 volts or more, which is able to\r\njump an air-gap in the shape of a spark at the secondary terminals. The\r\nlatter are connected to the earth and aerial, as explained above. The\r\nhigh potential currents are therefore enabled to charge the aerial. The\r\ncharge in the aerial exerts a great tendency to pass into the ground,\r\nbut is prevented from doing so by the small air-gap between the\r\nspark-balls until the charge becomes so great that the air-gap is\r\npunctured and the charge passes across and flows down into the ground.\r\nThe passage of the charge is made evident by the spark between the two\r\nspark-balls.\r\n\r\nThe electrical charges flowing up and down the aerial disturb the ether,\r\nstrike it a blow, as it were. The effect of the blow is to cause the\r\nether to vibrate and to send out waves in all directions. It may be\r\nlikened to the pond of water which is suddenly struck a blow by throwing\r\na stone into it, so that ripples are immediately sent out in widening\r\ncircles.\r\n\r\n*These Waves in the Ether* are called electro-magnetic or _Hertzian_\r\nwaves, after their discoverer, Hertz. The distance over which they pass\r\nis dependent upon the power of the transmitting station. The waves can\r\nbe made to correspond to the dots and dashes of the telegraphic code by\r\nso pressing the key. If some means of detecting the waves is employed we\r\nmay readily see how it is possible to send wireless messages.\r\n\r\n*The Action of the Receiving Station* is just the opposite of that of\r\nthe transmitter. When the waves pass out through the ether, some of them\r\nstrike the aerial of the receiving station and generate a charge of\r\nelectricity in it which tends to pass down into the earth. If the\r\ntransmitting and receiving stations are very close together and the\r\nformer is very powerful, it is possible to make a very small gap in the\r\nreceiving aerial across which the charge will jump in the shape of\r\nsparks. Thus the action of the receptor simply takes place in a reversed\r\norder from that of the transmitter.\r\n\r\nIf the stations are any considerable distance apart, it is impossible\r\nfor the currents induced in the receiving aerial to produce sparks, and\r\nso some more sensitive means of detecting the waves from the transmitter\r\nis necessary, preferably one which makes itself evident to the sense of\r\nhearing.\r\n\r\nThe telephone receiver is an extremely sensitive instrument, and it only\r\nrequires a very weak current to operate it and produce a sound. The\r\ncurrents or _oscillations_ generated in the aerial, however, are\r\nalternating currents (see pages 97-99) of _high frequency_, that is,\r\nthey flow in one direction and then reverse and flow in the other\r\nseveral thousand times a second. Such a current cannot be made to pass\r\nthrough a telephone receiver, and in order to do so the nature of the\r\ncurrent must be changed by converting it into direct current flowing in\r\none direction only.\r\n\r\nCertain minerals and crystals possess the remarkable ability to do this,\r\n_silicon_, galena, and iron pyrites are among the best.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 195.—A Simple Receptor.]\r\n\r\nThe diagram in Figure 195 shows the arrangement of a simple receiving\r\noutfit. The _detector_ consists of a sensitive mineral placed between\r\ntwo contacts and connected so that the aerial currents must pass through\r\nit on their way to the ground. A telephone receiver is connected to the\r\ndetector so that the _rectified currents_ (currents which have been\r\nchanged into direct current) pass into it and produce a sound. By\r\nvarying the periods during which the key is pressed at the transmitting\r\nstation, according to a prearranged code, the sounds in the receiver may\r\nbe made to assume an intelligible meaning.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO BUILD WIRELESS INSTRUMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n*The Aerial*\r\n\r\nEvery wireless station is provided with a system of wires elevated high\r\nin the air, above all surrounding objects, the purpose of which is to\r\nradiate or intercept the electromagnetic waves, accordingly as the\r\nstation is transmitting or receiving. This system of wires is, as\r\nalready has been stated, called the _aerial_ or _antenna_.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of the aerial will greatly determine the efficiency and\r\nrange of the apparatus.\r\n\r\nThe aerial should be as long as it is reasonably possible to make it,\r\nthat is from 50 to 150 feet.\r\n\r\nIt will be necessary for most amateurs to put up their aerial in some\r\none certain place, regardless of what else may be in the vicinity, but\r\nwhenever possible the site selected should preferably be such that the\r\naerial will not be in the immediate neighborhood of any tall objects,\r\nsuch as trees, smoke-stacks, telephone wires, etc., because such objects\r\nwill interfere with the aerial and noticeably decrease the range of the\r\nstation, both when transmitting and receiving.\r\n\r\nBare copper wire makes the best aerials. Aluminum wire is very often\r\nused and on account of its light weight causes very little strain on the\r\npoles or cross arms. Iron wire should never be used for an aerial, even\r\nif galvanized or tinned, because it tends to choke the currents which\r\nmust flow up and down the aerial when the station is in operation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 196.—Molded Aerial Insulator]\r\n\r\nThe aerial must be very carefully insulated from its supports and all\r\nsurrounding objects. The insulation must be strong enough to hold the\r\nweight of the aerial and able to withstand any strain caused by storms.\r\n\r\nSpecial aerial insulators made of molded insulating material and having\r\nan iron ring imbedded in each end are the best.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 197.—A Porcelain Cleat will make a Good Insulator\r\nfor Small Aerials.]\r\n\r\nOrdinary porcelain cleats may be used on small aerials where the strain\r\nis light.\r\n\r\nOne insulator should be placed at each end of each wire close to the\r\nspreader or spar.\r\n\r\nMost aerials are made up of four wires. The wires should be placed as\r\nfar apart as possible.\r\n\r\nThere are several different forms of aerials, the principal ones of\r\nwhich are shown in Figure 199. They are known as the grid, “V,\" inverted\r\n“L,” and “T” types.\r\n\r\nMost amateurs support their aerials from a pole placed on the top of the\r\nhouse, in a tree, or erected in the yard. Many use two supports, since\r\nsuch an aerial has many advantages. The facilities to be had for\r\nsupporting the aerial will largely determine which form to use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 198.—Method of Arranging the Wires and Insulating\r\nthem from the Cross Arm or Spreader.]\r\n\r\nThe grid aerial has no particular advantages or disadvantages.\r\n\r\nThe “V” aerial receives waves much better when they come from a\r\ndirection opposite to that in which the free end points. The \"free\" end\r\nof the aerial is the one not leading into the station.\r\n\r\nThe inverted “L” aerial possesses the same characteristics as the “V”\r\ntype.\r\n\r\nThe “T” aerial is the best “all around\" and is to be recommended\r\nwhenever it is possible to put up an aerial of this sort.\r\n\r\nMuch of the detail of actually putting up an aerial or antenna must be\r\nomitted, because each experimenter will usually meet different\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered, however, that the success of the whole\r\nundertaking will rest largely upon the construction of a proper aerial.\r\nThe most excellent instruments will not give very good results if\r\nconnected to a poor aerial, while, on the other hand, inferior\r\ninstruments will often give fair results when connected to a good\r\naerial.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 199.—Various Types of Aerials.]\r\n\r\nThe aerial should be at least thirty feet high.\r\n\r\nThe wire should not be smaller than No. 14 B. & S.\r\n\r\nThe masts which support the aerial should be of wood and provided with\r\npulleys so that the wires may be lowered any time it may be necessary.\r\nThe mast should be thoroughly braced with stays or guys so as to\r\ncounteract the strain of the aerial.\r\n\r\nThe aerial should not be hoisted up perfectly tight, but should be\r\nallowed to hang somewhat loose, as it will then put less strain on the\r\nropes and poles that support it.\r\n\r\nWhen an aerial is to be fastened in a tree, it is best to attach it to a\r\npole placed in the top of the tree, so that it will come well above any\r\npossible interference from the branches.\r\n\r\nThe wires leading from the aerial to the instruments should be very\r\ncarefully insulated throughout their length. This part of the aerial is\r\ncalled the \"rat-tail\" or lead-in.\r\n\r\nThe illustrations in Figure 199 show the proper place to attach the\r\n“lead-in\" form of aerial. The wires should gradually converge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 200.—A Ground Clamp for Pipes.]\r\n\r\nIt is very important that a good ground connection be secured for\r\nwireless instruments. A good ground is absolutely necessary for the\r\nproper working of the apparatus. Amateur experimenters usually use the\r\nwater or gas-pipes for a ground, and fasten the wires by means of a\r\nground clamp such as shown in Figure 200. In the country, where such\r\npipes are not available, it is necessary to bury a sheet of copper,\r\nthree or four feet square, in a moist spot in the earth and connect a\r\nwire to it.\r\n\r\n*The Receiving Apparatus*\r\n\r\nThe receiving instruments form the most interesting part of a wireless\r\nstation and usually receive first attention from the amateurs. They are\r\nthe ears of the wireless station and are wondrously sensitive, yet are\r\nvery simple and easy of construction.\r\n\r\nThe instruments necessary for receiving are:\r\n\r\nA Detector,\r\n\r\nA Tuning Coil or a Loose Coupler,\r\n\r\nA Fixed Condenser,\r\n\r\nA Telephone Receiver.\r\n\r\nOther devices, such as a test buzzer, variable condenser, etc., may be\r\nadded and will improve the outfit.\r\n\r\nAfter the aerial has been properly erected, the first instrument\r\nnecessary to construct will be either a tuning coil or a loose coupler.\r\nIt is a good plan to make a tuning coil first, and a loose coupler after\r\nyou have had a little experience with your apparatus.\r\n\r\n*A Tuning Coil* is a very simple arrangement making it possible to\r\nreceive messages from greater distances, and also somewhat to eliminate\r\nany messages not desirable and to listen without confusion to the one\r\nwanted.\r\n\r\nA tuning coil consists of a single layer of wire wound upon a cylinder\r\nand arranged so that connection may be had with any part of it by means\r\nof sliding contacts.\r\n\r\nThe cylinder upon which the wire is wound is a cardboard tube six and\r\nthree-quarters inches long and two and seven-eighths inches in diameter\r\noutside. It should be given two or three coats of shellac both inside\r\nand out so that it is thoroughly impregnated, and then laid away until\r\ndry. This treatment will prevent the wire from becoming loose after the\r\ntube is wound, due to shrinkage of the cardboard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 201.—Details of the Tuning Coil.]\r\n\r\nAfter having become dry, the tube is wound with a single layer of No. 25\r\nB. & S. gauge green silk or cotton-covered magnet wire. The wire must be\r\nwound on very smoothly and tightly, stopping and starting one-quarter of\r\nan inch back from each end. The ends of the wire are fastened by weaving\r\nback and forth through two small holes punched in the cardboard tube\r\nwith a pin.\r\n\r\nThe winding should be given a single coat of clear varnish or white\r\nshellac and allowed to dry.\r\n\r\nThe coil heads or end pieces are cut from one-half-inch wood according\r\nto the plan and dimensions shown in the accompanying illustration.\r\n\r\nThe top corners are beveled and notched to receive the slider-rods. A\r\ncircular piece of wood two and five-eighths inches in diameter and\r\nthree-eighths of an inch thick is nailed to the inside of each of the\r\ncoil heads to support the ends of the cylinder.\r\n\r\nThe wooden parts should be stained mahogany or some other dark color and\r\nfinished with a coat of shellac or varnish.\r\n\r\nThe slider-rods are square brass 3-16 x 3-16 inches and seven and\r\nthree-quarters inches long. A small hole is bored near the ends of each,\r\none-quarter of an inch from the edge, to receive a round-headed brass\r\nwood screw which holds the rod to the tuner end.\r\n\r\nThe sliders may be made according to the plan shown in Figure 201.\r\n\r\nThe slider is made from a small piece of brass tubing, three-sixteenths\r\nof an inch square. An 8-32 flat-headed brass screw is soldered to one\r\nface, in the center. A small strip of phosphor bronze sheet or spring\r\ncopper soldered to the bottom of the slider forms a contact for making\r\nconnection to the wire on the cylinder. A small \"electrose\" knob screwed\r\nto the slider makes a neat and efficient handle.\r\n\r\nTwo sliders are required, one for each rod.\r\n\r\nThe tuning coil is assembled as shown in Figure 203. The cardboard tube\r\nis held in place by several small brass nails driven through it into the\r\ncircular pieces on the coil heads.\r\n\r\nA slider is placed on each of the slider-rods and the rods fastened in\r\nthe slots in the coil ends by a small round-headed brass screw, passing\r\nthrough the holes bored near the ends for that purpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 202.—Side and End Views of the Tuning Coil.]\r\n\r\nTwo binding-posts are mounted on one of the coil ends. One should be\r\nconnected to each of the slider-rods. A third binding-post is placed\r\nbelow in the center of the head and connected to one end of the wire\r\nwound around the cylinder.\r\n\r\nA small, narrow path along the coil, directly underneath each slider and\r\nto which the copper strip can make contact, must be formed by scraping\r\nthe insulation off the wire with a sharp knife. The sliders should make\r\ncontact with each one of the wires as they pass over, and should slide\r\nsmoothly without damaging or disarranging any of the wires.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 203.—Complete Double-Slider Tuning Coil.]\r\n\r\nWhen scraping the insulation, be very careful not to loosen the wires or\r\nremove the insulation from between them, so that they are liable to\r\nshort-circuit between adjacent turns.\r\n\r\n*A Loose Coupler* is a much more efficient tuning device than a\r\ndouble-slider tuner, and sooner or later most amateur wireless operators\r\ninstall one in their station.\r\n\r\nThe loose coupler shown in the figure given on the next page is a very\r\nsimple one and is both easy and inexpensive to build. Its simplicity is\r\na disadvantage in one respect, however. Owing to its construction, it is\r\nimpossible to move the slider on the secondary when the latter is inside\r\nthe primary. The reason that I have chosen this sort of loose coupler to\r\ndescribe is to acquaint my young readers with the methods of making a\r\nloose coupler.\r\n\r\nThe \"Junior\" loose coupler described farther on is a more elaborate\r\ninstrument of greater efficiency, but much harder to build.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 204.—A Simple Loose Coupler.]\r\n\r\nThe base of the loose coupler is of wood and measures twelve by four\r\ninches. The head supporting the primary is of the same size as those\r\nused on the \"Junior\" double-slide tuning coil just described. It may be\r\nmade in the same manner, and fitted with a circular block to support the\r\ntube. The primary tube is of the same diameter as that on the tuning\r\ncoil but is only four inches long. It is fastened to the primary head\r\nwith glue and then secured with a number of small tacks. One or two\r\ncoats of shellac liberally applied will render it non-shrinkable, so\r\nthat the wire will not be apt to loosen after the loose coupler has been\r\nin use a while.\r\n\r\nThe secondary is of the same length as the primary, but of smaller\r\ndiameter, so that it will easily slip inside. It also is treated with\r\nshellac.\r\n\r\nThe primary should be wound with a single layer of No. 22\r\nsingle-silk-covered magnet wire. The secondary is wound with No. 29\r\nsingle-silk.\r\n\r\nThe head supporting the secondary is smaller than that used for the same\r\npurpose on the primary. The round boss to which the tube is fastened,\r\nhowever, is much thicker.\r\n\r\nThe secondary slides on a \"guide-rod\" supported at one end by passing\r\nthrough the primary head and at the other by a brass upright. The\r\nupright may also be made of wood.\r\n\r\nIf the secondary is \"offset,\" that is, placed out of center slightly to\r\none side, it will leave room so that the secondary slider will possibly\r\npass inside of the primary without striking.\r\n\r\nBoth the primary and the secondary must be fitted with \"sliders\" to make\r\ncontact with the various turns of wire.\r\n\r\nThe method of constructing a slider has already been described.\r\n\r\nThe ends of the slider-rods are bent at right angles and fastened to the\r\ncoil heads by two small screws passing through holes bored near the\r\nends. A small narrow path must be scraped in the insulation under each\r\nso that the slider will make contact with each turn. The secondary head\r\nmay be provided with a small electrose handle to facilitate sliding it\r\nback and forth.\r\n\r\nTwo binding-posts are mounted on each of the coil heads.\r\n\r\nOne post on each is connected to the end of the coil farthest from the\r\nhead, and the other posts are each connected to the slider-rods.\r\n\r\nFigure 220 shows how to connect the loose coupler in the receiving set.\r\n\r\nIn order to tune with a loose coupler, first adjust the slider on the\r\nprimary until the signals are the clearest. Then set the secondary\r\nslider in the best place and move the secondary in and out of the\r\nprimary until the signals are clearest.\r\n\r\n*How to Build the Junior Loose Coupler*\r\n\r\nA loose coupler of the sort just described is simple and quite easily\r\nconstructed, but will not be found to work as well as one in which the\r\nsecondary may be varied by means of a switch while it is inside of the\r\nprimary.\r\n\r\nThe base of the instrument measures twelve by three and five-eighths\r\ninches. The primary is composed of a single layer of No. 24 B. & S.\r\ngauge single-silk-covered wire wound on a cardboard tube two and\r\nthree-quarter inches in diameter and three and three-quarter inches\r\nlong. The winding is laid on in a single layer and should comprise about\r\n150 turns. After winding on tightly, it should be given a coat of clean\r\nwhite shellac and allowed to dry. The shellac is for the purpose of\r\nfastening the wire down tightly to the tube so that it will not loosen\r\nwhen the slider is moved back and forth.\r\n\r\nThe primary is mounted between two heads, the details of which are shown\r\nin Figure 205. One of the heads, _B_, has a flanged hole two and\r\nthree-quarter inches in diameter cut through the center so as to receive\r\nthe end of the tube and permit the secondary to pass inside.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 205.—Details of the Wooden Parts.]\r\n\r\nThe secondary winding is composed of a single layer of No. 28 B. & S.\r\ngauge silk-covered wire and divided into six equal sections. The\r\nsecondary is supported by two circular wooden pieces, _C_ and _F_, and\r\nslides back and forth on two guide-rods. The guide-rods should be brass.\r\nIron or steel rods running through the center of a loose coupler will\r\nseriously weaken the signals, and such practice must by all means be\r\navoided.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 206.—Side View of the Loose Coupler.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 207.—Top View of the Loose Coupler.]\r\n\r\nThe secondary sections are connected to six contacts and a switch-arm\r\nmounted on the end of the secondary so that by turning the switch either\r\none, two, three, four, five, or six sections of the winding may be\r\nconnected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 208.—End Views of the Loose Coupler.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 209.—Complete Loose Coupler.]\r\n\r\nThe two binding-posts near the secondary end of the coupler are\r\nconnected to the terminals of the secondary winding by means of two\r\nflexible wires. They have not been shown in several of the illustrations\r\nbecause they would be liable to confuse the drawing.\r\n\r\nThe primary is provided with a slider moving back and forth over a\r\nnarrow path scraped through the insulation so that it may make contact\r\nwith each wire independently.\r\n\r\n*Detectors*\r\n\r\nDetectors are very simple devices and consist merely of an arrangement\r\nfor holding a small piece of certain minerals and making a contact\r\nagainst the surface.\r\n\r\nThe crystal detector shown in Figure 210 is a very efficient form that\r\nmay be easily and quickly made. When finished, it will make a valuable\r\naddition to almost any amateur experimenter’s wireless equipment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 210.—A Crystal Detector.]\r\n\r\nThe bracket is bent out of a piece of strip brass about one-eighth of an\r\ninch thick and five-eighths of an inch wide, according to the shape\r\nshown in the illustration. The bracket is mounted on a circular  wooden\r\nbase about three inches in diameter. The circular wooden blocks used by\r\nelectricians in putting up chandeliers, called “fixture blocks,” will\r\nmake a satisfactory base. An electrose knob of the typewriter type may\r\nbe purchased from any good dealer in wireless supplies. It should be\r\nfitted with a threaded shank which will screw into a hole in the upper\r\npart of the bracket.\r\n\r\nThe mineral is contained in a small brass cup mounted on the base below\r\nthe end of the knob.\r\n\r\nContact with the mineral in the cup is made by means of a fine wire\r\nspring soldered to the end of the adjusting screw.\r\n\r\nMoving the screw up or down will vary the pressure of the spring on the\r\nmineral and permit the most sensitive adjustment to be secured. The\r\nbracket is connected to one of the binding-posts and the cup to the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 211.—Details of the Crystal Detector.]\r\n\r\nThe detector shown in Figure 212 is of the type often termed a\r\n\"cat-whisker,\" because of the long, fine wire resting on the mineral.\r\n\r\nIt consists of a small clip, formed by bending a strip of sheet-brass,\r\nwhich grips a piece of galena.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Double Slider Tuning Coil.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Junior Loose Coupler.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Crystal Detectors.]\r\n\r\nGalena may be obtained from any dealer in radio supplies. A piece of No.\r\n30 phosphor bronze wire is soldered to the end of a short length of\r\nbrass rod supported by a binding post. The other end of the rod is\r\nfitted with an electrose knob. This part of the detector is called the\r\n\"feeler.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 212 Details of the \"Cat Whisker\" Detector.]\r\n\r\nThe detector is fitted with binding posts and may be mounted upon any\r\nsuitable small base. The mineral clip is connected to one post and the\r\nbinding-post supporting the \"feeler\" to the other. The tension or\r\npressure of the end of the fine wire upon the mineral may be regulated\r\nby twisting the electrose knob so as to twist the rod. The different\r\nportions of the crystal may be \"searched\" for the most sensitive spot by\r\nsliding the rod back and forth.\r\n\r\nA somewhat similar form of cat-whisker detector is shown in Figure 213.\r\nIt is provided with a cup to hold the mineral in place of a clip.\r\n\r\nThe detector shown in Figure 214 is more elaborate than any of the\r\nothers described so far.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 213.—Another Form of the \"Cat-Whisker\" Detector.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 214.—\"Cat-Whisker\" Detector.]\r\n\r\nThe base is a wooden block, three and one-half by one and three-quarters\r\ninches by one-half inch. The binding-posts are of the type commonly used\r\non electrical instruments. One of the posts is pivoted so that it will\r\nswing from side to side. A short piece of brass rod fitted with a rubber\r\nor fiber knob passes through the wire hole in the post. A piece of No.\r\n30 B. & S. gauge bronze wire is soldered to the end of the rod. A small\r\nbrass cup contains the mineral, which may be either _galena_, or\r\n_silicon_. By twisting the post and sliding the rod back and forth, any\r\nportions of the mineral surface may be selected.\r\n\r\n*Fixed Condenser.*\r\n\r\nThe construction of the condenser is illustrated in Figure 205. Take\r\ntwenty-four sheets of thin typewriter paper, three by four inches, and\r\ntwenty-three sheets of tinfoil, two by four inches. Pile them up, using\r\nfirst a sheet of paper then a sheet of tinfoil, then paper, and so on,\r\nso that every two sheets of tinfoil are separated by a sheet of paper.\r\nEach sheet of tinfoil must, however, project out beyond the edge of the\r\npaper. Connect all the tinfoil projections on one end of the condenser\r\ntogether and and attach a small wire. Connect all those on the opposite\r\nside in a similar manner. Then fasten a couple of rubber bands around\r\nthe condenser to hold it together.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 215.—Building up a Fixed Condenser.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 216.—A Fixed Condenser enclosed in a Brass Case made\r\nfrom a Piece of Tubing fitted with Wooden Ends.]\r\n\r\nIf it is desired to give the condenser a finished appearance, it may be\r\nplaced in a brass tube fitted with two wooden or fiber ends. The ends\r\nare provided with binding-posts to which the terminals of the condenser\r\nare connected.\r\n\r\n*Telephone Receivers* for use with wireless instruments must be\r\npurchased. Their construction is such that they cannot be made by the\r\nexperimenter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 217.—A Telephone Head Set.]\r\n\r\nA seventy-five ohm, double-pole telephone receiver will do for stations\r\nnot wishing to receive farther than fifty miles.\r\n\r\nIn order to secure the best results from wireless instruments, it is\r\nnecessary to have receivers especially made for wireless. Each receiver\r\nshould have 1000 ohms resistance. Some boys may find it necessary to\r\npurchase one receiver at a time. Two receivers, a double headband, and a\r\ndouble cord, forming a complete head set as shown in Figure 217, should\r\nbe secured as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 218.—A Circuit showing how to connect a\r\nDouble-Slider Tuning Coil.]\r\n\r\n*Connecting the Receiving Apparatus*\r\n\r\nFigure 218 shows how to connect a double-slide tuner, a detector, a\r\nfixed condenser and a pair of telephones to the aerial and ground. The\r\nsame instruments with a loose coupler in place of the double-slide tuner\r\nare shown in Figure 219.\r\n\r\nThe diagrams in Figure 220 are the same circuits as those shown in\r\nFigures 218 and 219, but show different instruments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 219.—Circuit showing how to connect a Loose\r\nCoupler.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 220.—A Diagram showing how to connect some of the\r\nInstruments described in this Chapter.]\r\n\r\nAfter the instruments are connected, place a piece of galena or silicon\r\nin the cup of the detector and bring the wire down on it. Then move the\r\nsliders on the tuning coil or loose coupler and adjust the detector\r\nuntil you can hear a message buzzing in the telephones. It may require a\r\nlittle patience and practice, but if you persist you will soon learn how\r\nto adjust the apparatus so as to receive the signals loudly and clearly\r\nwith very little trouble.\r\n\r\n*The Transmitting Apparatus*\r\n\r\nSpark coils have already been described in Chapter XII. They may be used\r\nto transmit wireless messages simply by connecting to a spark-gap and a\r\nkey.\r\n\r\nSpark coils which are especially made for wireless telegraphy will\r\nusually send farther than an ordinary spark coil used for experimental\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 221.—A Wireless Spark Coil.]\r\n\r\nA good one-inch coil costs from $4.50 to $5.00 and will send from three\r\nto five miles if used with a fair aerial.\r\n\r\nA spark coil requires considerable current for its successful operation\r\nand will give the best results if operated on storage cells, dry cells,\r\nor bichromate cells. If dry cells are used, it is a good plan to connect\r\nthem in series multiple as shown in Figure 69.\r\n\r\nSpark-gaps may be made by mounting two double binding-posts on a wooden\r\nbase as shown in Figure 222.\r\n\r\nZinc possesses some peculiar property which makes it very efficient for\r\na spark-gap, and for this reason the electrodes of a spark-gap are\r\nusually zinc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 222.—Small Spark Gaps.]\r\n\r\nThe figure shows two different forms of electrodes. In one, they are\r\nmade of zinc rods and provided with “electrose” handles. In the other\r\ngap, the zinc electrodes are in the shape of \"tips\" fitted on the ends\r\nof two short brass rods.\r\n\r\nA one-inch spark coil will give very good results by connecting the\r\nspark-gap directly across the secondary of the coils. The aerial is\r\nconnected to one side of the gap and the ground to the other.\r\n\r\nThe transmitter may be \"tuned\" and the range sometimes increased by\r\nusing a condenser and a helix.\r\n\r\nA condenser is most easily made by coating the inside and outside of a\r\ntest-tube with tinfoil so as to form a miniature Leyden jar. The end of\r\nthe tube is closed with a cork through which passes a brass rod\r\nconnecting to the inner coating of tinfoil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 223.—Diagram showing how to connect a Simple\r\nTransmitter.]\r\n\r\nIf such a condenser is connected directly across the spark-gap, the\r\nspark will become very white and crackling.\r\n\r\nSeveral tubes may be arranged in a rack as shown in Figure 225.\r\n\r\nA helix consists of a spiral of brass ribbon set in a wooden frame. The\r\ntwo strips composing the frame are each nine inches long. The spiral\r\nconsists of eight turns of brass ribbon, three-eighths of an inch wide,\r\nset in saw-cuts made in the frame. A binding-post is connected to the\r\noutside end of the ribbon.\r\n\r\nFigure 228 shows how to connect a helix and a condenser to a coil and a\r\nspark-gap.\r\n\r\nThe two clips are made by bending a strip of sheet brass and connecting\r\na piece of flexible wire to one end.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 224.—A Test-Tube Leyden Jar.]\r\n\r\nIn large stations, the best position for the clips is found by placing a\r\n\"hot-wire ammeter\" in the aerial circuit and then moving the clips until\r\nthe meter shows the highest reading.\r\n\r\nThe young experimenter will have to tune his set by moving the helix\r\nclips about until the best results are obtained in sending.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 225.—Eight Test-Tube Leyden Jars mounted in a Wooden\r\nRack.]\r\n\r\nIf the spark coil is a good one and capable of giving a good hot spark,\r\nit may be possible to tell when the set is in proper tune by placing a\r\nsmall miniature tungsten lamp in series with the aerial and changing the\r\nclips, the condenser, and the length of the spark-gap until the lamp\r\nlights the brightest.\r\n\r\nAn _oscillation transformer_ is sometimes used to replace an ordinary\r\nhelix when it is desirable to tune a station very closely so that its\r\nmessages shall not be liable to be confused with those of another\r\nstation when both are working at the same time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 226.—A Helix and Clip.]\r\n\r\nAn oscillation transformer consists of two helixes arranged so that one\r\nacts as a primary and the other as a secondary. An oscillation helix may\r\nbe made by making two sets of helix frames similar to that in Secondary\r\nFigure 226.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 227.—An Oscillation Transformer.]\r\n\r\nThe primary should be provided with eight turns of brass ribbon and the\r\nsecondary with twelve. The primary supports a stiff brass rod upon which\r\nthe secondary is mounted. The secondary should slide up and down on the\r\nrod but move very stiffly so that it will stay where it is put.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN OSCILLATION HELIX.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN OSCILLATION CONDENSER.]\r\n\r\nAn ordinary double-throw, double-pole knife switch having a porcelain\r\nbase will make a very good aerial switch in a small station. It is used\r\nto connect the aerial and ground to either the transmitting or receiving\r\napparatus at will. Such a switch is shown in Figure 230.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 228.—Circuit showing how to connect a Helix and a\r\nCondenser.]\r\n\r\nThe aerial should be connected to the post _A_ and the ground to _B_.\r\nThe posts _E_ and _F_ lead to the transmitter, and _C_ and _D_ to the\r\nreceptor, or vice-versa according to which is the more convenient from\r\nthe location of the apparatus on the table or operating bench.\r\n\r\nA suitable table should be arranged to place the wireless instruments\r\nupon so that they may be permanently connected together.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 229.—Circuit showing how to connect an Oscillation\r\nTransformer and a Condenser.]\r\n\r\nThe Continental Code is the one usually employed in wireless telegraphy.\r\nIt differs slightly from Morse as it contains no space letters. It will\r\nbe found easy to learn and somewhat easier to handle than Morse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 230.—An Aerial Switch.]\r\n\r\nTwo or three months’ steady practice with a chum should enable the young\r\nexperimenter to become a very fair wireless telegraph operator. Then by\r\nlistening for some of the high power wireless stations which send out\r\nthe press news to ships at sea during the evening it should be possible\r\nto become very proficient. The press news is sent more slowly than\r\nordinary commercial wireless messages, and is therefore easy to read and\r\na good starting point for the beginner learning to read.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 231.—A Complete Wiring Diagram for both the\r\nTransmitter and the Receptor.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 232.—The Continental Alphabet.]\r\n\r\n*A Coherer Outfit*\r\n\r\n*A Coherer Outfit* is usually capable of only receiving messages coming\r\nfrom a distance of under one mile. In spite of this fact, however, it is\r\nan exceedingly interesting apparatus to construct and experiment with,\r\nand for this reason is found fully described below.\r\n\r\nA coherer set will ring a bell or work a sounder for short distances and\r\ntherefore is the best sort of an arrangement for demonstrating the\r\nworkings of your wireless apparatus to your friends.\r\n\r\nThe first thing that you need for a coherer is a pair of double\r\nbinding-posts. Mount these about an inch and three-quarters apart on a\r\nwooden base, six inches long and four inches wide as shown in Figure\r\n233.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 233.—A Coherer and a Decoherer.]\r\n\r\nGet a piece of glass tubing about an inch and one-half long and about\r\none-eighth of an inch inside diameter. You will also need some brass rod\r\nwhich will just slide into the tube tightly. Cut off two pieces of the\r\nbrass rod each one and three-quarters inches long and slip these through\r\nthe upper holes in the binding-posts and into the glass tube as shown in\r\nFigure 234. Before putting the second rod in place, however, you must\r\nput some nickel and silver filings in the tube, so that when the rods\r\nare pushed almost together, with only a distance of about one-sixteenth\r\nof an inch between them, the filings will about half fill the space.\r\n\r\nThe filings must be very carefully prepared, and in order to make them,\r\nfirst use a coarse-grained file on the edge of a five-cent piece. Do not\r\nuse the fine dust and powder, but only the fairly coarse filings. Mix a\r\nfew silver filings from a ten-cent piece with the nickel in such\r\nproportion that the mixture is 90% nickel and 10% silver.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 234.—Details of the Coherer.]\r\n\r\nYou will have to experiment considerably to find out just the right\r\namount of filings to place in the tube, and how far apart to place the\r\nbrass rods or plugs.\r\n\r\nRemove the gong from an old electric bell and mount the bell on the base\r\nas shown in Figure 233. It should be in such a position that the bell\r\nhammer will touch the coherer very lightly when the bell is ringing.\r\n\r\nThe two binding-posts, tube rods, and filings constitute the _coherer_.\r\nThe bell is the _decoherer_.\r\n\r\nThe next thing required in order to complete the apparatus is a relay.\r\nYou may use the relay described in Chapter X or build one according to\r\nthe plan shown in Figure 235. This relay consists of a single\r\nelectro-magnet mounted on a wooden base, two inches wide and four inches\r\nlong. The armature is a piece of soft iron rod one-quarter of an inch in\r\ndiameter and one-eighth of an inch long, riveted to the end of a thin\r\npiece of spring brass, about No. 34 B. & S. gauge in thickness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 235.—The Relay.]\r\n\r\nThe other end of the spring is fitted to a bracket and provided with a\r\nthumbscrew to adjust the tension of the spring.\r\n\r\nThe under side of the armature and the upper side of the magnet core are\r\neach fitted with a small silver contact.\r\n\r\nThe contacts should meet squarely when the armature is drawn down on to\r\nthe core by a current of electricity passing through the electro-magnet.\r\n\r\nBy turning the adjusting screw, the armature can be raised or lowered.\r\nIt should be adjusted so that it almost touches the core and is only\r\njust far enough away to slip a piece of thick paper under.\r\n\r\nThe terminals of the magnet are connected to the two binding-posts on\r\nthe base marked _S_ and _S_. One of the binding-posts, _P_, is connected\r\nto the brass upright, and the other is connected to the core of the\r\nmagnet.\r\n\r\nFigure 236 shows how to connect up the outfit. It will require some very\r\nnice adjusting before you will be able to get it to working properly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 236.—The Complete Coherer Outfit.]\r\n\r\nIf you wish to use the outfit for demonstration purposes or for sending\r\nmessages for very short distances, as for instance across a room, you do\r\nnot need an aerial but merely a pair of \"catch-wires.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"catch-wires\" are two pieces of stiff copper wire, about two feet\r\nlong, placed in the lower holes in the double binding-posts forming part\r\nof the coherer.\r\n\r\nIn order to set the apparatus for operation, raise the adjusting screw\r\nof the relay until the armature is quite far away from the core. Then\r\npush the armature down against the contact on the core. The decoherer\r\nshould then immediately operate and begin to tap the coherer. Then turn\r\nthe thumbscrew until the armature is brought down to the core in such a\r\nposition that it is as close as it is possible to get it without ringing\r\nthe bell.\r\n\r\nThe transmitter should consist of a spark coil, battery, key, and a\r\nspark-gap. The gap should be connected to the secondary of the coil and\r\nadjusted so that the electrodes are only about one-eighth of an inch\r\napart. The key is placed in series with the primary of the coil and the\r\nbattery, so that pressing the key will send a stream of sparks across\r\nthe gap. Fit the spark-gap with two catch-wires similar to those on the\r\ncoherer and place the transmitter about four or five feet away from the\r\ncoherer outfit.\r\n\r\nYou are now likely to find that if you press the key of the transmitter,\r\nthe decoherer will ring. It is possible that it will continue to ring\r\nafter you have stopped pressing the key. If such is the case, it will be\r\nnecessary to turn the adjusting screw on the relay so as to move the\r\narmature upward a short distance away from the core.\r\n\r\nIf the decoherer will not operate each time when you press the key, the\r\nbrass plugs in the coherer need adjusting. You must not be discouraged\r\nif you have some difficulty in making the apparatus work at first. After\r\nyou learn how to adjust it properly, you will find that you can move the\r\ntransmitter quite a distance away from the coherer and it will still\r\noperate very nicely.\r\n\r\nAfter you manage that, you can place the apparatus in separate rooms and\r\nfind it possible to work it just the same, because ordinary walls will\r\nnot make any difference to wireless waves.\r\n\r\nBear in mind that the nearer the coherer plugs are to each other, the\r\nmore sensitive the coherer will be, but that if too close, the decoherer\r\nwill not be able to shake the filings properly and will not stop when\r\nyou stop pressing the key.\r\n\r\nThe operation of the apparatus depends upon the fact that when properly\r\nadjusted the resistance of the filings between the two brass plugs is\r\ntoo great to allow sufficient battery current to flow to attract the\r\narmature of the relay. As soon as any wireless waves from the\r\ntransmitter strike the catch-wires of the coherer, they cause the\r\nfilings to cling together or cohere. When in this state, they have a low\r\nresistance and permit the current to flow in the relay circuit and draw\r\ndown the armature. The armature closes the second circuit and sets the\r\ndecoherer into operation. The decoherer shakes the filings and causes\r\nthem to decohere or fall apart and so makes them ready again for the\r\nnext signal.\r\n\r\nA coherer set of this sort may be used on an aerial and ground by\r\nsubstituting the coherer for the detector, but otherwise following any\r\nof the receiving circuits which have already been shown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV A WIRELESS TELEPHONE\r\n\r\n\r\nProbably many readers of the \"Boy Electrician\" are amateur wireless\r\noperators and have constructed their own apparatus with which they are\r\nable to pick up commercial messages or communicate with other\r\nexperimenters in the neighborhood, but not many have ever built a\r\nwireless telephone.\r\n\r\nThe device described in the following pages is easy to make and arrange,\r\nand will serve for some very interesting experiments.\r\n\r\nIt is of no practical value as a commercial wireless telephone, because\r\nthe distance over which it will transmit speech is limited to from 250\r\nto 300 feet. If you have a chum who lives across the street and within\r\nthe distance named above, it is possible for you to construct a simple\r\nwireless telephone which will enable you to remain in your own rooms and\r\ntalk to each other without any connecting wires.\r\n\r\nThe instruments operate by magnetic induction. It has already been\r\nexplained how it is possible for the current in the primary of an\r\ninduction coil to induce a current in the secondary coil, even though\r\nthe two are not electrically connected. This type of wireless telephone\r\nreally consists of an induction coil in which the two windings are\r\nwidely separated.\r\n\r\nSuppose that two coils of wire are connected as in Figure 237. The\r\nillustration shows that one coil, _A_, is connected in series with a set\r\nof batteries and a telegraph key. The terminals of the other coil, _B_,\r\nare connected to a telephone receiver. The coils are placed parallel to\r\neach other and a few inches apart. If the key is pressed so that the\r\nbattery current may flow through the coil, _A_, it will create a\r\nmagnetic field, and lines of force will be set up in the immediate\r\nvicinity. The lines of force will pass through the coil, _B_, and induce\r\nin it a current of electricity which will cause a sound like a click to\r\nbe heard in the telephone receiver.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 237.—A Simple Arrangement showing the Inductive\r\nAction between two Coils.]\r\n\r\nIf a telephone transmitter is substituted for the key and words are\r\nspoken into it, the current passing through the coil from the battery\r\nwill vary with each vibration of the voice and the words will be\r\ndistinctly repeated by the receiver connected to _B_.\r\n\r\nThis experiment may be tried by any boy with the equipment he probably\r\nhas already around his shop. Twenty-five to thirty turns of wire wound\r\naround a cardboard tube five or six inches in diameter will serve as a\r\ncoil. Two such coils, an ordinary telephone transmitter, a telephone\r\nreceiver and a couple of dry cells are all that is required.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 238.—A Simple Wireless Telephone. Speech directed\r\ninto the Transmitter can be heard in the Receiver, although there is no\r\ndirect electrical connection between the two.]\r\n\r\nThe diagram in the accompanying illustration shows how the apparatus is\r\narranged. The coils may be used several inches apart and the voice will\r\nbe clearly heard in the receiver.\r\n\r\nSuch an outfit is, however, only experimental, and if it is desired to\r\nmake a practical set, the coils, etc., must be much larger in diameter\r\nand contain a greater number of turns.\r\n\r\nLarger coils are made by first drawing a circle four feet in diameter on\r\nthe floor of the \"shop\" or attic. Then drive a number of small nails\r\naround the circumference, about four inches apart.\r\n\r\nProcure two and one-half pounds of No. 20 B. & S. gauge cotton-covered\r\nmagnet wire and wind it around the circumference of the circle. The wire\r\nshould form at least sixty complete turns. About one foot should be left\r\nat each end to establish connections with. After winding, the coil\r\nshould be tied about every six inches with a small piece of string so\r\nthat it will retain its shape and not come apart. The nails are then\r\npulled out so that the coil may be removed.\r\n\r\nThe coil may be used just as it is for experimental purposes, but if it\r\nis intended for any amount of handling it is wise to procure a large\r\nhoop such as girls use for rolling along the sidewalk, and make the coil\r\nthe same diameter as the hoop so that upon completion they may be firmly\r\nbound together with some insulating tape. Two binding-posts may then be\r\nfastened to the hoop and the terminals of the coil connected to them.\r\n\r\nTwo such coils are required for a complete wireless telephone system,\r\none to be located at each station.\r\n\r\nIt is also necessary to make a double-contact strap-key. Such a key is\r\neasily built out of a few screws and some sheet-brass. The illustration\r\nshows the various parts and construction so clearly that no detailed\r\nexplanation is necessary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 239.—A Double-Contact Strap-Key. The Dotted Lines\r\nshow how the Binding-Posts are connected.]\r\n\r\nThe telephone transmitter and the telephone receiver required for this\r\nexperiment must be very sensitive, and it is hardly possible for the\r\nyoung experimenter to build one which will be satisfactory. They can be\r\nsecured from a second-hand telephone or purchased at an electrical\r\nsupply house. The transmitter should be of the \"long distance\" type. An\r\n80-ohm receiver will serve the purpose, but if you also have a wireless\r\nstation, use the same 1000-ohm receivers belonging to your wireless set\r\nand you will secure very good results.\r\n\r\nA battery capable of delivering about 10 volts and a good constant\r\ncurrent is required.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus is connected as shown in Figure 240.\r\n\r\nWhen the key is pressed, the coil is connected to the battery and the\r\ntelephone transmitter. If words are then spoken into the transmitter\r\nthey will vary the amount of current flowing and the magnetic field\r\nwhich is set up in the neighborhood of the coil will induce currents in\r\nthe coil at the other station, provided that it is not too far away, and\r\ncause the words to be reproduced in the telephone receiver.\r\n\r\nWhen the key is released it will connect with the upper contact and\r\nplace the telephone receiver in the circuit for receiving, so that your\r\nchum at the other station can answer your message by pressing his key\r\nand talking into his transmitter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 240.—The Circuit of the Wireless Telephone. When the\r\nKey is up, the Receiver is ready for Action. When the Key is pressed,\r\nthe Transmitter and Battery are thrown into the Circuit.]\r\n\r\nThe best plan is to mount each of the coils upon a tripod and experiment\r\nby placing them close together at first and gradually moving them apart\r\nuntil the maximum distance that the apparatus will work is discovered.\r\n\r\nBe very careful to keep the two coils exactly parallel.\r\n\r\nMuch depends upon the battery. Be certain that it is capable of\r\ndelivering a good strong current. Do not hold the key down any longer\r\nthan is absolutely necessary, or the telephone transmitter will become\r\nhot.\r\n\r\nBy making the coils six feet in diameter and placing from 200 to 400\r\nturns of wire in each coil you can make a set which is capable of\r\ntransmitting speech 300 feet or more.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 241.—A Complete Wireless Telephone and Telegraph\r\nStation for Amateurs. 1.

Storage cells are the best for the purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI ELECTRIC MOTORS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first American patentee and builder of an electric motor was Thomas\r\nDavenport. The father of Davenport died when his son was only ten years\r\nold. This resulted in the young inventor being apprenticed to the\r\nblacksmith’s trade at the age of fourteen.\r\n\r\nSome years later, after having thoroughly learned his trade, he married\r\na beautiful girl of seventeen, named Emily Goss, and settled in the town\r\nof Brandon, Vermont, as an independent working blacksmith.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Joseph Henry invented the electro-magnet. Davenport\r\nheard of this wonderful \"galvanic magnet\" which it was rumored would\r\nlift a blacksmith’s anvil. This was his undoing, for never again was he\r\nto know peace of mind but was destined to always be a seeker after some\r\nelusive scientific \"will-o’-the-wisp.\" Although many times he needed\r\niron for his shop, the greater part of his money was spent in making\r\nelectro-magnets and batteries.\r\n\r\nIn those days insulated wire could not be purchased, and any one wishing\r\ninsulated wire had to buy bare wire and insulate it himself. It was then\r\nsupposed by scientists that silk was the only suitable material for\r\ninsulating wire and so Davenport’s brave young wife cut her silk wedding\r\ngown into narrow strips and with them wound the coils of the first\r\nelectric motor.\r\n\r\nContinuing his experiments in spite of almost insurmountable\r\ndifficulties and making many sacrifices which were equally shared by his\r\nfamily, he was enabled to make a trip to Washington in 1835 for the\r\npurpose of taking out a patent. His errand was fruitless, however, and\r\nhe was obliged to return home penniless.\r\n\r\nNothing daunted, he made the second and third trip and finally secured\r\nhis memorable patent, the first of the long line of electric-motor\r\npatents that have made possible both the electric locomotive that hauls\r\nits long train so swiftly and silently, and the whirring little fan\r\nwhich stirs up a breeze during the hot and sultry days.\r\n\r\nThese are a few of the reasons why a modest country blacksmith, in turn\r\nan inventor and an editor, through perseverance in struggling against\r\nadversity and poverty succeeded in placing his name on the list which\r\nwill be deservedly immortal among the scientists and engineers of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n*A Simple Electric Motor* can be made in fifteen minutes by following\r\nthe plan shown in Figure 242.\r\n\r\nThe armature is made by sticking a pin in each end of a long cork. The\r\npins should be as nearly central as it is possible to make them, so that\r\nwhen the cork is revolved upon them it will not wabble. The pins form\r\nthe shaft or spindle of the motor. Then take about ten feet of fine\r\nmagnet wire (Nos. 28-32 B. & S. gauge) and wind it on as shown in the\r\nillustration, winding an equal number of turns on each side of the two\r\npins.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 242.—A Simple Electric Motor which may be made in\r\nFifteen Minutes.]\r\n\r\nWhen this is finished, fasten the wire securely to the cork by binding\r\nit with thread.\r\n\r\nBend the two free ends (the starting and the finishing end) down at\r\nright angles and parallel to the shaft so as to form two commutator\r\nsections as shown in the upper left hand corner of Figure 242. Cut them\r\noff so that they only project about three-eighths of an inch. Bare the\r\nends of the wire and clean them with a piece of fine emery paper or\r\nsandpaper.\r\n\r\nThe bearings are made by driving two pins into a couple of corks so that\r\nthe pins cross each other as shown in the upper right-hand corner of\r\nFigure 242.\r\n\r\nThey must not be at too sharp an angle, or when the armature is placed\r\nin position, the friction of the shaft will be so great that it may not\r\nrevolve.\r\n\r\nThe motor is assembled by placing the armature in the bearings and then\r\nmounting two bar magnets on either side of the armature. The magnets may\r\nbe laid on small blocks of wood and should be so close to the armature\r\nthat the latter just clears when it is spun around by hand. The north\r\npole of one magnet should be next to the armature and the south pole of\r\nthe other, opposite.\r\n\r\nConnect two wires about one foot long and No. 26 B. & S. gauge in\r\ndiameter to a dry cell. Bare the ends of the wires for about an inch and\r\none half.\r\n\r\nTake the ends of the two wires between the forefinger and thumb and bend\r\nthem out, so that when the armature is revolved they can be made just to\r\ntouch the ends of the wire on the armature, or the \"commutator\r\nsections,\" as they are marked in the drawing.\r\n\r\nGive the armature a twist so as to start it spinning, and hold the long\r\nwires in the hand so that they make contact with the commutator as it\r\nrevolves.\r\n\r\nVery light pressure should be used. If you press too hard, you will\r\nprevent the armature from revolving, while, on the other hand, if you do\r\nnot press hard enough, the wires will not make good contact.\r\n\r\nThe armature will run in only one direction, and so try both ways. If\r\nyou start it in the right direction and hold the wires properly, it will\r\ncontinue to revolve at a high rate of speed.\r\n\r\nIf carefully made, this little motor will reward its maker by running\r\nvery nicely. Although it is of the utmost simplicity it demonstrates the\r\nsame fundamental principles which are employed in real electric motors.\r\n\r\n*The Simplex Motor* is an interesting little toy which can be made in a\r\ncouple of hours, and when finished it will make an instructive model.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 243.—Details of the Armature of the Simplex Motor.]\r\n\r\nAs a motor itself, it is not very efficient, for the amount of iron used\r\nin its construction is necessarily small. The advantage of this\r\nparticular type of motor and the method of making it is that it\r\ndemonstrates the actual principle and the method of application that is\r\nused in larger machines.\r\n\r\nThe field of the motor is of the type known as the \"simplex\" while the\r\narmature is the \"Siemens H\" or two-pole type. The field and the armature\r\nare cut from ordinary tin-plated iron such as is used in the manufacture\r\nof tin cans and cracker-boxes.\r\n\r\nThe simplest method of securing good flat material is to get some old\r\nscrap from a plumbing shop. An old cocoa tin or baking-powder can may,\r\nhowever, be cut up and flattened and will then serve the purpose almost\r\nas well.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 244.—The Armature.]\r\n\r\n*The Armature.* Two strips of tin, three-eighths of an inch by one and\r\none-half inches, are cut to form the armature. They are slightly longer\r\nthan will actually be necessary, but are cut to length after the finish\r\nof the bending operations. Mark a line carefully across the center of\r\neach strip. Then, taking care to keep the shape symmetrical so that both\r\npieces are exactly alike, bend them into the shape shown in Figure 243.\r\nThe small bend in the center is most easily made by bending the strip\r\nover a knitting-needle and then bending it back to the required extent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 245.—The Field.]\r\n\r\nA piece of knitting-needle one and one-half inches long is required for\r\nthe shaft. Bind the two halves of the armature together in the position\r\nshown in Figure 249. Bind them with a piece of iron wire and solder them\r\ntogether. The wire should be removed after they are soldered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 246.—The Field and Commutator.]\r\n\r\n*The Field Magnet* is made by first cutting out a strip of tin one-half\r\nby four and then bending it into the shape shown in Figure 245.\r\n\r\nThe easiest way of doing this with accuracy is to cut out a piece of\r\nwood as a form, and bend the tin over the form. The dimensions shown in\r\nFigure 245 should be used as a guide for the form.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 247.—The Bearings.]\r\n\r\nTwo small holes should be bored in the feet of the field magnet to\r\nreceive No. 3 wood screws, which fasten the field to the base.\r\n\r\n*The Bearings* are shown in detail in Figure 247. They are easily made\r\nby cutting from sheet-tin. Two small washers, serving as collars, should\r\nbe soldered to the shaft as shown in Figure 243.\r\n\r\n*The Commutator Core* is formed by cutting a strip of paper\r\nfive-sixteenths of an inch wide and about five inches long. It should be\r\ngiven a coat of shellac on one side and allowed to get sticky. The strip\r\nis then wrapped around the shaft until its diameter is three-sixteenths\r\nof an inch.\r\n\r\n*The Base* is cut from any ordinary piece of wood and is in the form of\r\na block about two by one and one-half by one-half inch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 248.—The Complete Motor.]\r\n\r\n*Assembling the Motor.* The parts must be carefully prepared for winding\r\nby covering with paper. Cut a strip of paper one-half inch wide and one\r\nand one-eighth of an inch long and give it a coat of shellac on one\r\nside. As soon as it becomes sticky, wrap it around the top bar of the\r\nfield magnet. The armature is insulated in exactly the same way, taking\r\ncare that the paper covers the entire flat portion.\r\n\r\nThe field and armature are now ready for winding. It is necessary to\r\ntake proper precautions to prevent the first turn from slipping out of\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nThis is accomplished by looping a small piece of tape or cord over it.\r\nThe next two turns are then taken over the ends of the loop so as to\r\nembed them. Wind on three layers of wire and when in the middle of the\r\nfourth layer embed the ends of another loop, which may be used at the\r\nend of the fourth layer to fasten the end so that it will not unwind.\r\nAfter the winding is finished, give it a coat of shellac.\r\n\r\nThe winding of the armature is somewhat more difficult.\r\n\r\nThe wire used for winding both the armature and the field should be No.\r\n25 or No. 26 B. & S. gauge double-cotton-covered.\r\n\r\nIn order to wind the armature, cut off about five feet of wire and\r\ndouble it back to find the center. Then place the wire diagonally across\r\nthe center of the armature so that there is an equal length on both\r\nsides. Place a piece of paper under the wire at the crossing point to\r\ninsulate it. Then, using one end of the wire, wind four layers on half\r\nof the armature. Tie the end down with a piece of thread and wind on the\r\nother half.\r\n\r\nThe ends of the wire are cut and scraped to form the commutator\r\nsegments. Figure 246 shows how this is done.\r\n\r\nBend the wires as shown so that they will fit closely to the paper core.\r\nBind them tightly into position with some silk thread. Use care so that\r\nthe two wires do not touch each other. Cut the free ends of the wires\r\noff close to the core.\r\n\r\nWhen finished, the relative positions of the armature and the commutator\r\nshould be as shown in Figure 248.\r\n\r\nThe brushes are made by flattening a piece of wire by a few light hammer\r\nblows.\r\n\r\nThe brushes are fastened under a small clamp formed by a strip of tin\r\nheld down at each end with a wood screw. They can be adjusted to the\r\nbest advantage only under actual working conditions when the current is\r\npassing through the motor. One or two dry cells should be sufficient to\r\noperate the motor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 249.—Details of the Motor.]\r\n\r\nOne end of the field winding is connected to one of the brushes. The\r\nother brush and the other end of the field form the terminals to which\r\nthe battery is connected.\r\n\r\nThe motor, being of the two-pole armature type, must be started when the\r\ncurrent is turned on by giving it a twist with the fingers.\r\n\r\n*A Larger Motor* may be built in somewhat the same manner as the one\r\njust described by cutting armature and field out of sheet tin. It will\r\nbe more substantial if it is built up out of laminations and not bent\r\ninto shape, as in the case of the other.\r\n\r\nLay out an armature disk and a field lamination on a sheet of tin in\r\naccordance with the dimensions and pattern shown in Figure 249. These\r\npieces are used as patterns for laying out the rest of the laminations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 250.—Complete Motor.]\r\n\r\nPlace them on some thin sheet-iron and trace the outline with a\r\nsharp-pointed needle. Then cut a sufficient number of pieces of each\r\npattern to form a pile three-quarters of an inch thick.\r\n\r\nFour laminations for the field should be cut with extensions shown by\r\nthe dotted lines. They are bent out at right angles for mounting the\r\nmotor and holding it upright.\r\n\r\nAssemble the armature and field by piling the pieces on top of each\r\nother and truing them up. Enough laminations should be used to form a\r\npile three-quarters of an inch thick when piled up and clamped tightly.\r\n\r\nFile off any burrs and rough edges and then bind the laminations\r\ntogether with some string to hold them until wound.\r\n\r\nWrap a couple of layers of paper around those portions of the armature\r\nand field which are liable to come into contact with the iron. Five or\r\nsix layers of No. 18 B. & S. gauge double-cotton-covered magnet wire are\r\nsufficient to form the field coil.\r\n\r\nThe armature is wound with three or four layers of wire of the same\r\nsize.\r\n\r\nThe commutator is made out of a circular piece of hard wood or fiber,\r\nfitted with segments cut out of thin sheet-copper. The segments may be\r\nfastened to the core with thick shellac or some melted sealing-wax. The\r\nends may be bound down tightly by wrapping with silk thread.\r\n\r\nThe brushes are cut out of thin sheet-copper similar to that used for\r\nthe commutator segments.\r\n\r\nThe bearings are strips of heavy sheet-brass bent into the shape shown.\r\nThey are mounted by passing a nail through the holes in the ends and\r\nthrough the holes, A and B, in the field and then riveting the ends\r\nover.\r\n\r\nAssemble the motor as shown in Figure 255. If desirable, a small pulley\r\nmay be fitted to the shaft and the motor used to run small mechanical\r\ntoys. If it is properly constructed, two or three dry cells will furnish\r\nsufficient current to run the motor at high speed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII DYNAMOS\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is perhaps no other electrical device entering into the young\r\nexperimenter’s domain requiring the careful workmanship and tool\r\nfacilities that the dynamo does. In order to construct a practical\r\nworking dynamo it would be necessary to have at hand a lathe for turning\r\nthe castings.\r\n\r\nRather than describe a machine which comparatively few of my readers\r\nwould be able to build, I have explained below how it is possible to so\r\nalter an old telephone magneto that it may be made to serve as a small\r\ndynamo. Telephone magnetos, also sometimes called hand generators, are\r\nused in many telephone systems to supply the current which rings the\r\ntelephone bell at the other end. The magneto is placed in a small box on\r\nthe telephone, only the handle being exposed. In order to make a call\r\nthe handle is given several brisk turns before raising the receiver.\r\nWhen the handle is turned the moving parts of the generator revolve and\r\nproduce a current of electricity which goes forth over the line and\r\nrings the bell at the other end.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 251—A Telephone Magneto.]\r\n\r\nTelephone magnetos are gradually being discarded in all the large\r\ntelephone systems, a method known as \"central energy,\" in which the\r\ncurrent for ringing bells is supplied from the central office, taking\r\ntheir place. For that reason, there are a great many telephone magnetos\r\nto be found in second-hand shops and at electrical houses, where they\r\ncan be purchased for a fractional part of the original cost. Fifty cents\r\nwill buy a first-class second-hand telephone magneto. The author saw a\r\npile of telephones as large as a haystack, each telephone containing a\r\nmagneto, in the back yard of a second-hand shop, and the owner would\r\nhave been glad to sell the complete instruments for fifty cents each.\r\n\r\nBefore explaining how to reconstruct such a machine, it is best to\r\nimpress upon the reader that a careful study of the principles of the\r\ndynamo is well worth the time spent.\r\n\r\nAlmost any book on physics or electricity, or even the encyclopedia,\r\nwill be found to contain a description of this wonderful machine that\r\nsupplies the power for running the trolley cars, electric lights, etc.,\r\nin fact all of the electricity in use to-day with the exception of that\r\ngenerated by batteries for telegraph and telephone lines.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that if a bar magnet is suddenly plunged into a\r\nhollow coil of wire, a momentary electric current will be generated in\r\nthe coil. The current is easily detected by means of an instrument\r\ncalled a galvanometer. The space in the vicinity of a magnet is filled\r\nwith a peculiar invisible force called magnetism. The magnetism flows\r\nalong a certain path, passing through the magnet itself and then\r\nspreading out in curved lines. If a sheet of paper is laid over a magnet\r\nand a few iron filings are sprinkled on the paper, they will follow the\r\nmagnetic lines of force.\r\n\r\nWhen the magnet is plunged into the hollow coil, the lines of force flow\r\nthrough the turns of wire, or are said to cut them. Whenever lines of\r\nforce cut a coil of wire and they are in motion, electricity is\r\nproduced. It does not matter whether the coil is slipped over the magnet\r\nor the magnet is plunged into the coil, a current will be produced as\r\nlong as they are in motion. As soon as the magnet or the coil stops\r\nmoving the current stops.\r\n\r\nBy arranging a coil of wire between the poles of a horse-shoe magnet so\r\nthat it can be made to revolve, the motion can be made continuous and\r\nthe current of electricity maintained.\r\n\r\nFigure 252 shows such an arrangement. Some means of connection with the\r\ncoil of wire must be established so that the current can be led off. If\r\ntwo metal rings are connected to the ends of the coil, connection can be\r\nmade by little strips of metal called brushes rubbing against the rings.\r\nThis scheme is the principle of the telephone magneto and the basis of\r\nall dynamos.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 252.—The Principle of the Alternator and the\r\nDirect-Current Dynamo.]\r\n\r\nIn the telephone magneto, more than one horseshoe magnet is usually\r\nprovided. The coil of wire revolves between the poles of the magnets.\r\nThe coil is wound around an iron frame and together they are called the\r\narmature. The end of the armature shaft is fitted with a small spur gear\r\nmeshing with a larger gear bearing a crank, so that when the crank is\r\nturned the motion is multiplied and the armature is caused to revolve\r\nrapidly. One end of the coil or armature winding is connected to a small\r\nbrass pin. This pin connects with a second pin set in the end of the\r\nshaft in an insulating brush of hard rubber. The other terminal of the\r\ncoil is connected to the armature itself. Thus connection can be had to\r\nthe coil by connecting a wire to the frame of the machine and to the\r\ninsulated pin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 253.—Details of the Armature, Commutator, and\r\nBrushes.]\r\n\r\nThe armature of a magneto is usually wound with a very fine silk\r\ninsulated wire, about No. 36 B. & S. gauge in size. This should be\r\ncarefully removed and wound upon a spool for future use. Replace the\r\nwire with some ordinary cotton-covered magnet wire, about No. 24 or 25\r\nB. & S. gauge, winding it on very carefully and smoothly. Connect one\r\nend of the winding to the pin leading to the insulated pin by soldering\r\nit. This pin is the one at the end of the shaft opposite to that one to\r\nwhich the spur gear is fastened. Connect the other end of the wire to\r\nthe pin at the same end of the shaft as the gear. This pin is grounded,\r\nthat is, connected to the frame.\r\n\r\nAn ordinary telephone magneto gives a very high voltage current. The\r\nvoltage may vary from twenty-five to several hundred, depending upon how\r\nfast the machine is run. This is due to the fact that the armature\r\nwinding is composed of a very large number of turns of wire. The more\r\nturns that are placed on the armature, the higher its voltage will be.\r\nThe current or amperage of a large telephone magneto wound with a large\r\nnumber of turns of fine wire is very low. Too low in fact to be used for\r\nanything except ringing a bell or testing. Winding the armature with\r\nfewer turns of large wire reduces the voltage and increases the amperage\r\nso that the current will light a small lamp or may be used for other\r\npurposes. The winding does not change the principle of the magneto, it\r\nmerely changes its amperage and voltage.\r\n\r\nThe magneto may be mounted on a wooden base-board and screwed to a\r\ntable, so that the handle may be turned without inconvenience. A small\r\nstrip of copper, called a brush, should be fastened to the base with a\r\nscrew and brought to bear against the end of the insulated pin. The\r\nbrush should be connected to a binding-post with a piece of wire. A\r\nsecond wire leading to a binding-post should be connected to the frame\r\nof the magneto. When the handle is turned rapidly, currents may be drawn\r\nfrom the two binding-posts.\r\n\r\nThe current is of the kind known as alternating, that is to say, it\r\nflows first in one direction, then reverses and flows in the other.\r\n\r\nIn order to make the machine give direct current, it must be fitted with\r\na commutator. This is somewhat difficult with some magnetos but the\r\nfollowing plan may be carried out in most cases. Cut a small fiber\r\ncircle or disk about one inch in diameter from sheet fiber\r\nthree-sixteenths of an inch thick. Cut a small hole in the center, just\r\nlarge enough so that the fiber will slip very lightly over the end of\r\nthe shaft from which the insulated pin projects. Two small commutator\r\nsections similar to that shown in Figure 253 must be cut from\r\nsheet-brass or sheet-copper. The three long ears shown in the drawing\r\nare bent back around the fiber and squeezed down flat with a pair of\r\npincers so that they grip the fiber very tightly and will not slip. One\r\near on one section should be bent over the back down to the hole, where\r\nit will connect with the shaft. The other section of the commutator is\r\nconnected to the insulated pin by a drop of solder. In this manner, one\r\nend of the winding is connected to one section of the commutator and the\r\nother end to the other section. The commutator should fit tightly on the\r\nend of the shaft so that it will not twist. The dividing line between\r\nthe section should be parallel to a line drawn to the axis of the actual\r\narmature coil. When the iron parts of the armature are nearest the poles\r\nof the horseshoe magnets in their revolution, the slot in the commutator\r\nshould be horizontal.\r\n\r\nWhen the magnet is provided with a commutator, it may also be run as a\r\nmotor by connecting it to a battery. In order to operate it either as a\r\ndynamo or a motor, however, it must first be fitted with a pair of\r\nbrushes. They are shown in detail in Figure 253. They are made from two\r\nsmall strips of sheet-copper bent as shown and mounted on a small wooden\r\nblock. They must be adjusted to bear against the commutator so that when\r\nthe dividing line between the two sections is horizontal, the upper\r\nbrush bears against the upper section and the lower brush against the\r\nlower section. The two brushes form the terminals of the machine. They\r\nshould be connected to binding-posts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 254.—The Complete Generator.]\r\n\r\nIn order to operate the dynamo properly and obtain sufficient current\r\nfrom it to operate a couple of small incandescent lamps, it will have to\r\nbe provided with a pulley mounted on the end of the shaft after the gear\r\nwheel has been removed. The dynamo may then be driven at high speed by\r\nconnecting it to a sewing-machine with a belt, or the back wheel of a\r\nbicycle from which the tire has been removed.\r\n\r\nThe completed dynamo is shown in Figure 254. The voltage and amperage of\r\nthe dynamo will depend upon the machine in question, not only upon the\r\nsize of the wire but also upon the size of the machine, the speed at\r\nwhich it is run, and the strength of the horseshoe magnets. It is\r\nimpossible to tell just what the current will be until it is tested and\r\ntried.\r\n\r\n\r\nA 10-Watt Dynamo\r\n\r\n\r\nProbably few experimenters fully understand how almost impossible it is\r\nto construct a dynamo, worthy of the name as such, without resort to\r\nmaterials and methods employed in the commercial manufacture of such\r\nmachines. Practical telegraph instruments, telephones, etc., can be\r\nconstructed out of all sorts of odds and ends, but in order to make a\r\nreal dynamo it is necessary to use certain materials for which nothing\r\ncan be substituted.\r\n\r\n_The field magnets_ must be soft gray cast-iron except in special\r\ninstances.\r\n\r\n_The wire_ used throughout must be of good quality and must be new.\r\n\r\nThe necessity for good workmanship in even the smallest detail cannot be\r\noverestimated. Poor workmanship always results in inefficient working.\r\nNo dynamo will give its stated output continuously and safely unless the\r\nmaterials and workmanship are up to a high standard.\r\n\r\nSince castings must be used as field magnets, a pattern is necessary to\r\nform the mould for the casting. Pattern work is something requiring\r\nskill and knowledge usually beyond the average experimenter. A lathe is\r\nnecessary in order to bore or tunnel the space between the ends of the\r\nfield magnet into which the armature fits.\r\n\r\nIt may be possible for several boys to club together and have a pattern\r\nmade by a pattern-maker for building a dynamo. Then by using the lathe\r\nin some convenient shop or manual training school secure a field magnet\r\nand armature for a really practical small dynamo.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 255.—Details of the Field Casting.]\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, I have described below a small dynamo of about ten\r\nwatts output, the castings for which can be purchased from many\r\nelectrical dealers with all machine work done at an extremely low price.\r\n\r\nThe field magnet shown in Figure 255 is drawn to scale and represents\r\nthe best proportions for a small \"overtype\" dynamo of ten to fifteen’\r\nwatts output.\r\n\r\nThe dimensions are so clearly shown by the drawings that further comment\r\nin that respect is unnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe armature is of the type known as the \"Siemen’s H.\" It is the\r\nsimplest type of armature it is possible to make, which is a feature of\r\nprime importance to the beginner at dynamo construction, although it is\r\nnot the most efficient form from the electrical standpoint. The armature\r\nin this case is also a casting and therefore a pattern is required.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 256.—Details of the Armature Casting.]\r\n\r\nThe patterns for both the field and the armature are of the same size\r\nand shape as shown in Figures 255 and 256. They are made of wood, and\r\nare finished by rubbing with fine sandpaper until perfectly smooth and\r\nthen given a coat of shellac. The parts are also given a slight \"draft,\"\r\nthat is, a taper toward one side, so that the pattern may be withdrawn\r\nfrom the mould.\r\n\r\nThe patterns are turned over to a foundry, where they are carefully\r\npacked in a box, called a \"flask,\" full of moulder’s sand. When the\r\npatterns are properly withdrawn, they will leave a perfect impression of\r\nthemselves behind in the sand. The mould is then closed up and poured\r\nfull of molten iron. When the iron has cooled the castings are finished\r\nexcept for cleaning and boring.\r\n\r\nThe shaft is a piece of steel rod, three-sixteenths of an inch in\r\ndiameter, and four and one-half inches in length.\r\n\r\nThe portion of the field into which the armature fits is bored out to a\r\ndiameter of one and five-sixteenth inches. Considerable care is\r\nnecessary in performing this operation in order not to break the field\r\nmagnet apart by taking too heavy a cut.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 257.—Details of the Commutator.]\r\n\r\nThe armature should be turned down to a diameter of one and one-quarter\r\ninches or one-sixteenth of an inch smaller than the tunnel in which it\r\nrevolves between the field magnets. The center of the armature is bored\r\nout to fit the shaft.\r\n\r\nFigure 257 shows a two-part commutator for fitting to an armature of the\r\n\"Siemen’s H\" type. It consists of a short piece of brass tubing fitted\r\non a fiber core and split length-wise on two opposite sides, so that\r\neach part is insulated from the other.\r\n\r\nThe fiber is drilled with a hole to fit tightly on the shaft. It is then\r\nplaced in a lathe and turned down until a suitable piece of brass tube\r\ncan be driven on easily.\r\n\r\nTwo lines are then marked along the tube diametrically opposite. A short\r\ndistance away from each of these lines, and on each side of them, bore\r\ntwo small holes to receive very small wood screws. The screws should be\r\ncounter-sunk. It is very important that none of the screws should go\r\ninto the fiber core far enough to touch the shaft.\r\n\r\nThe commutator may then be split along each of the lines between the\r\nscrews with a hacksaw. The saw-cut should be continued right through the\r\nbrass and slightly into the insulating core. The space between the\r\nsections of the commutator should be fitted with well-fitting slips of\r\nfiber, glued in.\r\n\r\nThe commutator should now be trued up and made perfectly smooth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 258.—Diagram showing how to connect the Armature\r\nWinding to the Commutator.]\r\n\r\nThe commutator is provided with a small brass machine screw threaded\r\ninto each section near the edge as shown in Figure 257. These screws are\r\nto receive the ends of the armature winding and so facilitate\r\nconnections.\r\n\r\nThe commutator, shaft and armature are assembled as shown in Figure 258.\r\n\r\nThe armature may be held to the shaft by a small set screw or a pin. The\r\ncommutator should fit on the shaft very tightly so that it will not slip\r\nor twist.\r\n\r\nEvery part of the armature and shaft touched by the armature winding\r\nmust be insulated with paper which has been soaked in shellac until\r\nsoft. The armature must be left to dry before winding.\r\n\r\nThe armature should next be wound with No. 20 B. & S. gauge\r\nsingle-cotton-covered magnet wire. Sufficient wire should be put on to\r\nfill up the winding space completely. Care should be taken, however, not\r\nto put on too much wire or it will interfere with the field magnets and\r\nthe armature cannot revolve. After winding the armature, test it\r\ncarefully to see that the wire is thoroughly insulated from the iron.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 259.—Details of the Wooden Base.]\r\n\r\nIf the insulation is correct, paint the whole armature with thick\r\nshellac varnish and bake it in a warm oven to set the shellac.\r\n\r\nFigure 258 is a diagram showing how the winding is made and connected.\r\nIt is wound about the armature, always in the same direction, just as if\r\nthe armature were an ordinary electro-magnet.\r\n\r\nThe ends of the winding are each connected to one of the commutator\r\nsections by scraping the wire and placing it under the screws.\r\n\r\nThe winding space in the field magnet should be shellacked, and\r\ninsulated with brown paper by wrapping the core with a strip of paper\r\nand covering the bobbin ends with circular pieces made in two halves.\r\n\r\nThe field magnet is wound full of No. 20 B. & S. gauge\r\nsingle-cotton-covered wire. The wire should be put on in smooth, even\r\nlayers and the winding space completely filled up.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 260.—The Pulley and Bearings.]\r\n\r\nThe base for the dynamo is a piece of hard wood, five inches long, four\r\ninches wide, and five-eighths of an inch thick.\r\n\r\nThe bearings are small brass castings of the dimensions shown in Figure\r\n260. It is necessary first to make a wooden pattern and send it to the\r\nfoundry for the castings.\r\n\r\nThe bearings are fastened to the projecting arms on the field casting by\r\nmeans of machine screws eight-thirty-seconds of an inch in thickness.\r\n\r\nThe field magnet should not be screwed down on to the base until the\r\narmature runs easily and truly in the tunnel.\r\n\r\nThe brushes are made from thin gauge sheet-copper according to the shape\r\nand dimensions shown in Figure 261.\r\n\r\nThey are bent at right angles and mounted on the base on either side of\r\nthe commutator with small round-headed wood screws.\r\n\r\nThe completed dynamo is shown in Figure 262. One end of the shaft is\r\nprovided with a small pulley to accommodate a small leather belt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 261.—The Brushes.]\r\n\r\nThe dynamo is connected as a \"shunt\" machine, that is, one terminal of\r\nthe field magnet is connected to one of the brushes, and the other\r\nterminal to the other brush.\r\n\r\nA wire is then led from each of the brushes to a binding-post.\r\n\r\nA shunt dynamo will only generate when run in a certain direction. In\r\norder to make it generate when run in the opposite direction, it is\r\nnecessary to reverse the field connections.\r\n\r\nThe dynamo just described should have an output of from 10 to 15 watts\r\nand deliver about 6 volts and 1 3/4 to 2 1/2 amperes.\r\n\r\nIn order to secure current from the dynamo it will first be necessary to\r\nmagnetize the field by connecting it to several batteries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE JUNIOR DYNAMO MOUNTED ON A LONG WOODEN BASE AND\r\nBELTED TO A GROOVED WHEEL FITTED WITH A CRANK SO THAT THE DYNAMO CAN BE\r\nRUN AT HIGH SPEED BY HAND POWER. THE ILLUSTRATION ALSO SHOWS A SMALL\r\nINCANDESCENT LAMP CONNECTED TO THE DYNAMO SO THAT WHEN THE CRANK IS\r\nTURNED THE LAMP WILL LIGHT.]\r\n\r\nIt will be found that the dynamo will also operate as a very efficient\r\nlittle motor, but that on account of having a two-pole armature it must\r\nbe started by giving the shaft a twist.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 262.—Complete Dynamo.]\r\n\r\nIt can be used as a generator for lighting small lamps, electro-plating,\r\netc., but cannot be used for recharging storage cells on account of\r\nhaving a two-pole armature.\r\n\r\nThe dynamo may be driven with a small water motor or from the\r\ndriving-wheel of a sewing-machine.\r\n\r\nBefore the machine will generate as a dynamo, it must be connected to a\r\nbattery and run as a motor. This will give the field the \"residual\r\nmagnetism\" which is necessary before it can produce current itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII AN ELECTRIC RAILWAY\r\n\r\n\r\nNo toys loom up before the mind of the average boy with more appeal to\r\nhis love of adventure than do railway cars and trains. In England, the\r\nconstruction and operation of miniature railways is the hobby not only\r\nof boys but of grown men, and on a scale that is hardly appreciated in\r\nthis country.\r\n\r\nThe height of ambition of many boys is not only to own a miniature\r\nrailway system but to build one. For some unknown reason, none of the\r\nboys’ papers or books have heretofore given any information on this\r\ninteresting subject. The car shown in Figure 263 is such that it can be\r\neasily built by any boy willing to exercise the necessary care and\r\npatience in its construction.\r\n\r\nThe first operation is to cut out the floor of the car. This is a\r\nrectangular piece of hard wood, eight inches long, three and one-quarter\r\ninches wide and one-half of an inch thick. Its exact shape and\r\ndimensions are shown in Figure 264.\r\n\r\nThe rectangular hole cut in the floor permits the belt which drives the\r\nwheels to pass down from the counter-shaft to the axle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 263.—Complete Electric Railway operated by Dry\r\nCells. Note how the Wires from the Battery are connected to the Rails by\r\nmeans of the Wooden Conductors illustrated in Figure 277.]\r\n\r\nThe two pieces forming the wheel-bearings are cut out of sheet-brass\r\naccording to the shape and dimensions shown in Figure 265. The brass\r\nshould be one-sixteenth of an inch thick. The two projecting pieces at\r\nthe top are bent over at right angles so that they can be mounted on the\r\nunder side of the car floor by small screws passing through the holes.\r\nThe holes which form the bearings for the ends of the axles upon which\r\nthe wheels are mounted should be three inches apart. The bearings cannot\r\nbe placed in position on the under side of the car floor until the\r\nwheels and axles are ready, but when this work is done, care should be\r\ntaken to see that they line up and come exactly opposite to each other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 264.—Details of the Floor of the Car.]\r\n\r\nThe wheels themselves cannot be made by the young experimenter unless he\r\nhas a lathe. They are flanged wheels, one and one-eighth inches in\r\ndiameter, and are turned from cast iron or brass. Such wheels can be\r\npurchased ready made, or it may be possible to obtain from some broken\r\ntoy a set which will prove suitable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 265.—Details of the Bearing which supports the Wheel\r\nand Axle.]\r\n\r\nEach shaft is composed of two pieces of \"Bessemer\" rod held together by\r\na short piece of fiber rod having a hole in each end into which one end\r\nof each piece of iron rod is driven. The wheels fit tightly on the other\r\nend of each of these pieces. They should be spaced so as to run on rails\r\ntwo inches apart.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 266.—The Wheels and Axle.]\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the fiber rod is to insulate the halves of the axle from\r\neach other. The electric current which operates the car is carried by\r\nthe two rails which form the track, and if the axles were made in one\r\npiece or the halves joined together so as to form an electrical\r\nconnection, the battery furnishing the current would be short-circuited,\r\nbecause the current would pass along the two rails and across the axles\r\ninstead of through the motor.\r\n\r\nOne pair of wheels are fitted with a grooved pulley one inch in\r\ndiameter.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to say that the wheels and axles should be\r\nperfectly aligned, and should run true.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 267.—The Motor.]\r\n\r\nThe motor used to drive the car will prove more satisfactory if\r\npurchased ready made. A self-starting three-pole motor similar to that\r\nshown in Figure 267 will serve very nicely. The wooden base should be\r\nremoved and the motor screwed down firmly to the floor of the car as in\r\nFigure 268.\r\n\r\nOne terminal of the motor is connected to one of the bearings, and the\r\nother terminal to the other bearing.\r\n\r\nThe motor is belted to a countershaft so that it will have sufficient\r\npower to move the car. It cannot be directly connected or belted to the\r\naxle, because the speed of a small motor is so high that it has\r\ncomparatively little turning power or _torque_. The speed must be\r\nreduced and the torque increased before it will drive the car.\r\n\r\nThe countershaft consists of two grooved pulleys mounted upon an axle\r\nrunning in two bearings mounted upon the floor of the car. The bearings\r\nare made from a strip of heavy sheet-brass, bent at right angles and\r\nfastened to the car floor with small screws. The large pulley, _A_, is\r\none inch and one half in diameter and the small pulley, _B_, is\r\nfive-sixteenths of an inch in diameter. The countershaft is mounted in\r\nsuch a position that a belt may be run from the small pulley, _B_, to\r\nthe pulley mounted on the axle of one pair of wheels. A belt is also run\r\nfrom the small pulley on the motor to the large pulley, _A_, on the\r\ncountershaft. The pulleys must all be carefully lined up so that the\r\nbelts will run in their grooves without danger of slipping out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 268.—The Complete Truck of the Car without the\r\nBody.]\r\n\r\nThe shield on the platform at each end of the car is made of sheet-iron\r\nor tin. Two small projections on the bottom are bent over at right\r\nangles and used to secure the shields in position by driving a small\r\ntack through them into the floor of the car.\r\n\r\nThe steps on either side of each platform are also made by bending\r\nstrips of sheet-iron or tin and fastening them to the car with small\r\nnails or tacks.\r\n\r\nThe coupler consists of a strip of tin having a small hook soldered to\r\nthe end so that a trail car may be attached if desirable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 269.—Pattern for the Sides and Ends of the Car.]\r\n\r\nThe car is now ready for testing, and when held in the hand so that the\r\nwheels are free to run, two cells of dry battery should be found all\r\nthat is necessary to drive them at a fair rate of speed. The two wires\r\nleading from the battery should be connected to the bearings, one wire\r\nleading to each bearing. It will require more than two cells, however,\r\nto drive the wheels properly when the car is on the track, All moving\r\nparts should run freely and smoothly. The car may be used just as it is,\r\nbut if fitted with a body and a top it will present a much more\r\nrealistic appearance.\r\n\r\nThe sides and ends of the car body are made of sheet-iron or tin. Figure\r\n269 shows the pattern and dimensions for these parts. They may be made\r\nfrom one piece of metal eighteen and one-half inches long and three and\r\nthree-quarters inches wide. The doors and windows are cut out with a\r\npair of tin-snips. The small projections along the top are bent down at\r\nright angles and the roof is fastened to them. The dotted lines indicate\r\nthe places for bending these projections and also the sides and ends of\r\nthe car.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 270.—The Roof of the Car.]\r\n\r\nThe roof is made in two pieces. It also is sheet-iron or tin. The roof\r\nproper is eight inches long and four inches wide. It has a hole five and\r\none-half inches long and one and three-quarters inches wide cut in the\r\ncenter. A number of small projections are left and bent upward to\r\nsupport the deck and to form imitation ventilators. The deck is six\r\ninches long and two and one-quarter inches in width. It is placed in\r\nposition on the roof and fastened by soldering. The roof is fastened to\r\nthe sides and ends of the car by soldering. It must be bent slightly to\r\nconform with the curve at the top of the front and the rear of the car.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 271.—The Completed Car.]\r\n\r\nThe car when completed will appear as in Figure 271.\r\n\r\nThe track is made of smooth spring steel, one-half inch wide and either\r\nNo. 20 or No. 22 gauge in thickness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 272.–Details of a Wooden Tie.]\r\n\r\nThe wooden ties are three and one-half inches long, three-quarters of an\r\ninch wide and three-eighths of an inch thick. Each tie has two saw-cuts,\r\nexactly two inches apart across the top face. This part of the work is\r\nbest performed in a miter-box so that the cuts will be perfectly square\r\nacross the ties. A saw should be used which will make a cut of such a\r\nsize that the steel track will fit tightly into it.\r\n\r\nThe distance between the two rails of the track, or the \"gauge,\" as it\r\nis called, is two inches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 273.–Arrangement of Track.]\r\n\r\nThe track is assembled as in Figure 273. The spring steel is forced into\r\nthe saw-cuts in the ties by tapping with a light wooden mallet. The ties\r\nshould be spaced along the track about three inches apart. The work of\r\nlaying the track must be very carefully done so that the car wheels will\r\nnot bind at any spot. Curves should not be too sharp, or the car will\r\nnot pass around.\r\n\r\nThe track may be laid out in a number of different shapes, some of which\r\nare shown in Figure 274.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 274.—Three Different Patterns for laying out the\r\nTrack.]\r\n\r\nA circle is the easiest form of track to make. In laying out a circle or\r\nany sort of curved track, the outside rail must necessarily be made\r\nlonger than the inside one.\r\n\r\nThe oval shape is a very good form to give the track in a great many\r\ncases, especially where it is desirable for the car to have a longer\r\npath than that afforded by a circle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 275.—Details of the Base of the Cross-over.]\r\n\r\nIn order to make a figure-eight out of the track, a crossing, or\r\n\"cross-over,\" as it is sometimes called, will be required. This is shown\r\nin Figure 275. A cross-over permits two tracks to cross each other\r\nwithout interference. It consists of a wooden base, eight inches square\r\nand three-eighths of an inch thick. Four saw-cuts, each pair exactly\r\nparallel, and two inches apart, are made at right angles to each other\r\nacross the top surface of the base, as shown in the illustration.\r\n\r\nThe track used on the cross-over is semi-hard hoop-brass, one-half of an\r\ninch wide and of the same gauge as the steel track. The brass is more\r\neasily bent than the steel and is used for that reason, it being\r\npractically impossible to bend the steel track at right angles without\r\nsnapping it.\r\n\r\nFour pieces of the brass, each five inches long, are bent at right\r\nangles exactly in the center. Four short pieces, each one and one-half\r\ninches long, will also be required.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 276.—The Completed Cross-over.]\r\n\r\nThe cross-over is assembled as shown in Figure 276. The strips marked\r\n_D_ are strips of very thin sheet-brass or copper. The purpose of these\r\nstrips is to connect the ends of the track on the cross-over to the ends\r\nof the track forming the figure-eight so that the cross-over will not be\r\na \"dead\" section, that is, a section of track where the car cannot get\r\nany current.\r\n\r\nThe long strips, bent at right angles to each other and marked _A_, _A_,\r\n_B_, _B_, in the illustration, are forced into the saw-cuts in the base\r\nover the strips marked _D_.\r\n\r\nThe small pieces, _C_, _C_, _C_, _C_, are placed in between the long\r\nstrips, leaving a space between so that the flanges of the car wheels\r\ncan pass. The pieces, _C_, _C_, _C_, _C_, should form a square open at\r\nthe corners. The two long strips, _A_, _A_, should be at opposite\r\ncorners diagonally across the square. _B_ and _B_ should occupy the same\r\nrelative position at the other corners. _A_ and _A_ are connected\r\ntogether and _B_ and _B_ are connected together by wires passing on the\r\nunder side of the base.\r\n\r\nThe ends of the track forming the figure-eight are forced into the\r\nsaw-cuts at the edges of the base so that they form a good electrical\r\nconnection with the small strips marked _D_.\r\n\r\nIt is quite necessary to use care in arranging a figure-eight track, or\r\nthere will be danger of short-circuiting the batteries. The outside\r\nrails of the figure-eight, distinguished by the letter _B_ in the\r\nillustration, should be connected together by the cross-over. The inside\r\nrails, marked _A_, should also be connected together by the cross-over.\r\n\r\nIn order to make a good mechanical and electrical connection between the\r\nends of the rails when two or more sections of track are used in laying\r\nout the system, it is necessary to either solder the rails together or\r\nelse use a connector such as that shown in Figure 277.\r\n\r\nThis consists of a small block of wood having a saw-cut across its upper\r\nface and a piece of thin sheet-brass set into the cut. The two rails are\r\nplaced with their ends abutting and one of these connectors slipped up\r\nfrom beneath and forced on the rails. The piece of thin brass set into\r\nthe wooden block serves to make an electrical connection between the two\r\nrails and also to hold them firmly in position. A small screw and a\r\nwasher placed outside the track and passing through the brass strip will\r\nallow a battery wire to be conveniently attached.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 277.—A Connector for joining the Ends of the Rails.]\r\n\r\nThe steel rails should be occasionally wiped with machine oil or\r\nvaseline to prevent rusting, and also to allow the car to run more\r\nfreely wherever the flanges of the wheels rub against the rails in\r\npassing around a curve.\r\n\r\nFour dry cells or three cells of storage battery should be sufficient to\r\noperate the car properly. If it is desirable, a small rheostat may be\r\nincluded in the battery circuit, so that the speed of the car can be\r\nvaried at will. The motor and the wheels should be carefully oiled so\r\nthat they will run without friction. The belts should not be so tight\r\nthat they cause friction or so loose that they allow the motor to slip,\r\nbut should be so adjusted that the motor runs freely and transmits its\r\npower to the wheels.\r\n\r\nThe car may be made reversible by fitting with a small current reverser,\r\nbut unless the reverser is carefully made the danger of loss of power\r\nthrough poor contacts is quite considerable. If the car is fitted with a\r\nreverser the handle should be arranged to project from the car in a\r\nconvenient place where it can be easily reached by the fingers and the\r\ncar sent back or forth at will.\r\n\r\nA railway system such as this can be elaborated and extended by adding\r\nmore than one car to the line or such features as bridges and stations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 278.—A Bumper for preventing the Car from leaving\r\nthe Rails.]\r\n\r\nThe ends of a blind section of track, that is, a straight piece of track\r\nnot part of a circle or curve so that the car can return, should be\r\nfitted with a track bumper, to prevent the car leaving the rails.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 279.—A Design for a Railway Bridge.]\r\n\r\nNo dimensions are given in Figures 279 and 280, showing designs for a\r\nbridge and a station, because they are best left to be determined by the\r\nscale upon which the railway system is to be extended.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 280.—A Design for a Railway Station.]\r\n\r\nBoth the bridge and the station are very simple. The bridge is built\r\nentirely of wood, with the exception of the steel rails.\r\n\r\nThe station may be made out of thin wood, such as cigar-box wood. The\r\ndoors, windows, etc., may be painted on the walls. If this is carefully\r\ndone, it will give a very realistic appearance to your station.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX MINIATURE LIGHTING\r\n\r\n\r\nMiniature lighting is a field of many interesting possibilities for the\r\nyoung experimenter. Any labor expended along this line will result in\r\nsomething far more useful from a practical standpoint than almost any of\r\nthe other things described in this book.\r\n\r\nMiniature lights, operated from batteries, may be used in various ways;\r\nto light dark corners, hallways, or other places where a light is often\r\ntemporarily wanted without the accompanying danger and nuisance of\r\nmatches or kerosene lamps.\r\n\r\nMiniature lighting has only been made practical by the tungsten filament\r\nlamp. The filament, or wire inside the globe, which becomes hot and\r\nemits the light when the current is turned on, is made of _tungsten_ in\r\na tungsten lamp. In the earlier lamps, it was made of carbon. The carbon\r\nlamp is now seldom used and is highly inefficient when compared to the\r\ntungsten.\r\n\r\n*A Carbon Lamp* consumes about three and one-half watts of current for\r\neach candle-power of light, whereas a small tungsten lamp uses only\r\nabout one watt per candle-power small tungsten lamp uses only about one\r\nwatt per candle-power. The tungsten lamp is therefore three times as\r\nefficient as a carbon lamp, and when used on a battery of equal voltage\r\nit is possible to obtain the same amount of light with one-third of the\r\ncurrent that would be required by a carbon lamp.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 281.—Miniature Carbon Battery Lamp.]\r\n\r\nCarbon lamps similar to that shown in Figure 281 are made in a number of\r\ndifferent voltages. The lowest voltage that it is practically possible\r\nto make a carbon lamp for is three and one-half. A three-and-one-half\r\nvolt carbon lamp is designed to be operated on small dry cells such as\r\nflashlight batteries. The E. M. F. of a dry cell is about one and\r\none-half volts, but when three small dry cells of the flashlight type\r\nare connected in series and used to operate a lamp, their voltage\r\n\"drops,\" and the available E. M. F. is only about three and one-half\r\nvolts.\r\n\r\nFour-volt carbon lamps are intended to be operated on large dry\r\nbatteries or wet cells because they do not lose their voltage as quickly\r\nas small dry cells. The table below gives the voltage and candle-power\r\nof the various small carbon lamps which are carried in stock by most\r\nelectrical dealers or supply houses:\r\n\r\n*MINIATURE CARBON BATTERY LAMPS*\r\n\r\n3.5 volts for flashlight batteries\r\n\r\n4 volts. 2 candle-power\r\n\r\n5.5 volts for flashlight batteries\r\n\r\n6 volts. 2 candle-power\r\n\r\n6 volts. 4 candle-power\r\n\r\n8 volts. 4 candle-power\r\n\r\n10 volts. 6 candle-power\r\n\r\n*Tungsten Lamps* are made for voltages as low as one and one-half, and\r\nwill light on one cell of dry battery. The range of voltages is quite\r\nwide and varied. A few of the most common sizes are given below:\r\n\r\n*MINIATURE TUNGSTEN BATTERY LAMPS*\r\n\r\n1.5 volts. for one dry cell\r\n\r\n2.5 volts. for two-cell flashlight battery\r\n\r\n2.8 volts. for two-cell flashlight battery\r\n\r\n3.5 volts. for three-cell flashlight battery\r\n\r\n3.8 volts. for three-cell flashlight battery\r\n\r\n4 volts. 4 candle-power\r\n\r\n6 volts. 2 candle-power\r\n\r\n6 volts. 4 candle-power\r\n\r\n6 volts. 6 candle-power\r\n\r\n6 volts. 8-10-12-16-20-24 candle-power\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 282.—Miniature Tungsten Battery Lamp.]\r\n\r\nTo find the approximate amount of current drawn from a battery by a\r\ntungsten lamp, divide the candle-power by the voltage and the result\r\nwill be the current in amperes. For example, a 6 v. 2 c. p. lamp will\r\nrequire, 2 divided by 6, or one-third of an ampere.\r\n\r\nSix-volt tungsten lamp giving a light greater than six candle-power are\r\nonly used on storage batteries and are employed principally for\r\nautomobile lighting.\r\n\r\nThe filament of a tungsten lamp is much longer than that of a carbon\r\nlamp and is usually in the form of a spiral or helix, as shown in Figure\r\n282.\r\n\r\nThe bases of battery lamps, the base being the lower portion of the\r\nlamp, which is made of brass and fits into a socket or receptacle, are\r\nmade in three different styles: _miniature_, _candelabra_, and\r\n_Ediswan_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 283.—Lamps fitted respectively with Miniature,\r\nCandelabra, and Ediswan Bases.]\r\n\r\nThe miniature and candelabra bases have a threaded brass shell on the\r\noutside and a small brass contact-button on the bottom. They are similar\r\nexcept in respect to size. The miniature base is smaller than the\r\ncandelabra. The Ediswan base is a plain brass shell having two pins on\r\nthe side and two contacts on the bottom. This type of base is only used\r\nin this country on automobiles. The miniature and the candelabra bases\r\nare standard for battery lighting. The miniature base has many\r\nadvantages over the candelabra for the young experimenter, and should be\r\nadopted in making any of the apparatus described in this chapter. These\r\nthree bases are shown in Figure 283.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 284.—Miniature Flat-Base Porcelain Receptacle.]\r\n\r\nIn order to form a good electrical connection between the lamp and the\r\npower wires some sort of a receptacle or socket is necessary. The most\r\ncommon arrangement for this purpose is the miniature flat-base porcelain\r\nreceptacle shown in Figure 284. This type of receptacle is used in\r\nplaces where it can be permanently fastened in position with two small\r\nscrews.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 285.—Weather-proof and Pin-Sockets.]\r\n\r\nThe devices shown in Figure 285 are known respectively as a porcelain\r\nweather-proof socket and a pin-socket. Sockets similar to the\r\nweather-proof socket are also made of wood. The weather-proof sockets\r\nare used in places where the light is to be exposed out-of-doors, as for\r\ninstance on a porch. The small metal parts are sealed in the porcelain\r\nand entirely protected.\r\n\r\nThe pin-sockets and the wooden sockets are used principally on Christmas\r\ntrees or in decorative outfits where lamps are hung in festoons. The\r\nflat-base receptacle, the pin-socket, and also the wooden socket will be\r\nfound very useful in making the apparatus described farther on in this\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n*The Wires* used to carry the current in a miniature lighting system may\r\nbe of the sort known as _annunciator_ or _office_ wire if the wires are\r\nto be run entirely indoors. The wire should not be smaller than No. 16\r\nB. & S. gauge. When the wires are run outdoors, on a porch, or in some\r\nother place exposed to the weather, the wire used should be\r\nrubber-covered. Hanging lights or lights intended to be adjustable\r\nshould be connected with \"flexible conductor.\" This is made of a number\r\nof very fine wires braided together and insulated with silk. The wires\r\nused in a lighting system should not in any case be longer than it is\r\nnecessary to have them. When a battery is connected to a system of wires\r\nit is found that the voltage at the end of the wires is much lower than\r\nat a point near the battery. This is called voltage \"drop,\" and is much\r\ngreater as the wires grow longer. A light placed at the end of two very\r\nlong wires will not burn as brightly as it would if connected to the\r\nsame battery by means of short wires.\r\n\r\n*Switches* can be made by following the suggestions given in Chapter\r\nVII. Suitable switches can be purchased for a few cents at a most any\r\nelectrical house and will prove very much neater and efficient. They\r\nshould preferably be of any of the types shown in Figure 286.\r\n\r\n*The Batteries* used for miniature lighting may be made up of storage\r\ncells, dry cells or carbon cylinder cells. Storage cells will prove the\r\nmost satisfactory, provided that the experimenter has some convenient\r\nmeans of recharging them or of having them recharged. Storage cells will\r\nbe found of especial value wherever it is desirable to operate several\r\nlights from one battery.\r\n\r\nCarbon cylinder cells are only suitable where one cell is to be operated\r\nat a time. If more than one is used, the battery is liable to become\r\npolarized and the lamps will not burn brightly. Carbon cylinder\r\nbatteries are very inexpensive to renew, and will be found the cheapest\r\nmethod of lighting a small tungsten lamp.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 286.—Types of Battery Switches suitable for\r\nMiniature Lighting.]\r\n\r\nIf lamps requiring more than two amperes are to be operated on dry\r\ncells, the latter should be connected in series-multiple, as shown in\r\nFigure 69. Two sets of dry cells connected in series-multiple will give\r\nmore than twice the service of a single set.\r\n\r\nLamps may be connected either in multiple or in series, provided that\r\nthe proper voltages of both battery and lamps are used.\r\n\r\nWhen they are to be connected in multiple, the voltage of the lamps\r\nshould be the same as that of the battery. When they are to be used in\r\nseries, the voltage of the lamps multiplied by the number used should\r\nequal the voltage of the battery. For example, suppose that you wish to\r\nuse a number of six-volt lamps on a six-volt storage battery. In that\r\ncase they must be connected in multiple. But if it should be that the\r\nlamps are only two-volt lamps and you wish to operate three of them on a\r\nsix-volt battery you will have to place them in series.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 287.—How Lamps are Connected in Multiple.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 288.—How Lamps are Connected in Series.]\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes desirable to arrange a lamp and two switches so that it\r\ncan be turned off or on from either switch independently of the other.\r\nThis is called \"three-way wiring,\" and is a very convenient method of\r\narranging a light in a hallway. If one switch is placed at the top of a\r\nstairway and the other switch at the bottom, a person can pass upstairs\r\nor downstairs, light the lamp ahead, and turn it out as he passes the\r\nlast switch, no matter in which direction the previous user of the light\r\nmay have gone.\r\n\r\nThe switches are two-point switches, and the circuit should be arranged\r\nas in Figure 289.\r\n\r\nThe switch-levers should always rest on one of the contacts and never be\r\nleft between, as shown in the drawing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 289.—Three-way Wiring Diagram. The Light may be\r\nturned off or on from either Switch.]\r\n\r\nThey are represented that way in the illustration in order not to\r\nconceal the contacts.\r\n\r\nSmall brackets made of brass and similar to that shown in Figure 290 are\r\nfor sale at many electrical supply houses, and will add a very realistic\r\nappearance to a miniature lighting plant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 290.—A Lamp Bracket for Miniature Lighting.]\r\n\r\nBrackets may be constructed after the plan shown in Figure 291. A wooden\r\nsocket or a pin-socket is mounted on the end of a small piece of brass\r\ntubing which has been bent into the shape shown in the illustration. The\r\nother end of the tube is set into a wooden block so that the bracket may\r\nbe mounted on the wall. The wires from the socket lead through the brass\r\ntube and through the back or top of the block.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 291.—A Home-made Bracket.]\r\n\r\nHanging lights may be arranged by fitting a wooden socket and a lamp\r\nwith a reflector as shown in Figure 296. The reflector consists of a\r\ncircular piece of tin or sheet-aluminum having a hole in the center\r\nlarge enough to pass the base of a miniature lamp. The circle is then\r\ncut along a straight line from the circumference to the center. If the\r\nedges are pulled together and lapped the circular sheet of metal will\r\ntake on a concave shape and form a shade or reflector which will throw\r\nthe light downwards. The overlapping edges of the reflector should be\r\nsoldered or riveted together. The reflector is slipped over the base of\r\nthe lamp, a small rubber or felt washer having been placed over the base\r\nnext to the glass bulb so that the reflector will not break the lamp.\r\nThe lamp is then screwed into a socket and allowed to hang downwards\r\nfrom a flexible conductor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 292.—A Hanging Lamp.]\r\n\r\nA very pretty effect can be secured by drilling the edges of a reflector\r\nfull of small holes about three-sixteenths of an inch apart and then\r\nhanging short strings of beads from the holes. The beads should form a\r\nhanging fringe around the edge of the reflector, and if they are of\r\nglass, a pleasing brilliancy is produced. Figure 293 shows how to make\r\nthe reflector.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 293.—How the Reflector is made.]\r\n\r\nThe batteries for a miniature lighting plant may be located in a closet,\r\nunder a stairway, or in some other out-of-the-way place. Wires from\r\nthere may be extended to various parts of the house, such as hallways,\r\nclosets, the cellar stairs, over a shaving-mirror in the bath-room or in\r\nany dark corner where a light is often temporarily needed. The wires can\r\nbe run behind picture-mouldings or along the surbase and be almost\r\nentirely concealed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 294.—A Three-Cell Dry Battery for use in\r\nHand-Lanterns, etc.]\r\n\r\n*Small Batteries* consisting of three small dry cells enclosed in\r\ncardboard box, as shown in Figure 294, are on the market, and may be\r\nbought at prices ranging from thirty to forty cents, depending upon the\r\nsize and the maker. One of the most convenient and practical sizes of\r\nthis type of battery has the dimensions shown in the illustration, and\r\nwith its aid it is possible to construct a number of very useful\r\nelectrical novelties and household articles in the shape of portable\r\nelectric lamps, etc. These batteries are quite small and are only\r\nintended to operate very small lamps. Only one lamp should be used on\r\neach battery at a time, and it should not be allowed to burn long. Some\r\nof these batteries will give ten to fourteen hours of intermittent\r\nservice but if allowed to burn continuously would only light the lamp\r\nfor about five hours at the most. It is much the better plan to use them\r\nonly for a few minutes at a time, and then turn the light off and allow\r\nthe battery to recuperate.\r\n\r\n*An Electric Hand-Lantern* is a very convenient device which is quite\r\nsimple to make. It consists of a wooden box large enough to receive a\r\nthree-cell battery, such as that shown in Figure 295. The back of the\r\nbox should open and close on hinges and be fastened with a hook so that\r\nthe battery may be easily removed for renewal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 295.—An Electric Hand-Lantern.]\r\n\r\nA three-and-one-half-volt tungsten lamp is mounted on the front of the\r\nlantern and connected with the battery and a switch so that the light\r\ncan be turned on and off at will. The switch may be placed at the top of\r\nthe box so that the fingers of the same hand used to carry the lantern\r\nmay be used to turn the light on and off. The lantern is fitted with a\r\nleather strap at the top, to be convenient for carrying.\r\n\r\n*The Ruby Lantern* shown in Figure 296 is somewhat similar in\r\narrangement to the lantern just described, which may be used both as a\r\nhand-lantern and a ruby light for developing photographs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 296.—An Electric Ruby Lantern.]\r\n\r\nIt consists of a wooden box to hold a three-cell dry battery, and is\r\nprovided with a handle so that it may be easily carried. A switch by\r\nwhich to turn the lamp on and off is mounted on the side of the box.\r\n\r\nThe light is furnished by a three-and-one-half-volt tungsten lamp\r\nmounted on the front of an inclined wooden board arranged as shown in\r\nthe illustration so as to throw the light downward. The sides and bottom\r\nof the box are grooved near the front edges so that a piece of ruby\r\nglass may be inserted. Ruby glass for this purpose may be purchased at\r\nalmost any store dealing in photographers’ supplies.\r\n\r\nThe top is provided with a shield which is fastened in position by means\r\nof four small hooks after the glass is in place. The shield is used in\r\norder to prevent any white light from escaping through the crack between\r\nthe glass and the top of the box. A ruby lamp of this sort must be made\r\nabsolutely \"light-tight\" so that the only light emitted is that which\r\npasses through the ruby glass. If any white light escapes it is liable\r\nto fog and spoil any pictures in process of development.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 297.—The Electric Ruby Lamp with Glass and Shield\r\nRemoved.]\r\n\r\nBy removing the ruby glass and the shield, as shown in Figure 297, the\r\nlight is changed into a hand-lantern. The back of the box should be made\r\nremovable so that the battery can be replaced when worn out.\r\n\r\n*A Night-Light* arranged to shine on the face of the clock so that the\r\ntime may be easily told during the night without inconvenience is shown\r\nin Figure 298.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 298.—An Electric Night-Light for telling the Time\r\nduring the Night.]\r\n\r\nIt consists of a flat wooden box containing a three-cell dry battery and\r\nhaving a small three-and-one-half-volt tungsten lamp mounted on the top\r\nin the front with room for a clock to stand behind. The battery and the\r\nlamp are connected to a switch so that the light may be turned on and\r\noff. By attaching a long flexible wire and a push-button of the\r\n\"pear-push\" type it is possible to place the light on a table and run\r\nthe wire with the push-button attached over to the bed so that one may\r\nsee the time during the night without getting up. The bottom of the box\r\nshould be made removable so that a new battery may be inserted when the\r\nold one is worn out.\r\n\r\n*The Watch-Light* is in many ways similar to the clock light just\r\ndescribed—but is smaller. It consists of a box just large enough to\r\nreceive a three-cell flashlight battery. A piece of brass rod is bent\r\ninto the form of a hook or crane from which to suspend the watch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 299.—A Watch-Light.]\r\n\r\nThe light is supplied by a three-and-one-half-volt tungsten flashlight\r\nbulb mounted on the top of the box in front of the watch. If desirable,\r\nthe light may be fitted with a small shade or reflector so that it\r\nshines only on the dial and not in the eyes. The figures on the face of\r\nthe timepiece can then be seen much more plainly.\r\n\r\nThe lamp is mounted in a small wooden socket or a pin-socket passing\r\nthrough a hole in the top of the box, so that the wires are concealed. A\r\nsmall push-button is located in one of the forward corners of the box,\r\nso that when it is pressed the lamp will light. Two small binding-posts\r\nmounted at the lower right-hand corner of the box are connected directly\r\nacross the terminals of the switch, so that a flexible wire and a\r\npush-button can be connected, and the light operated from a distance.\r\n\r\n*An Electric Scarf-Pin* can be made by almost any boy who is skillful\r\nwith a pocket-knife. The material from which the pin is made may be a\r\npiece of bone, ivory, or meerschaum. It is carved into shape with the\r\nsharp point of a penknife and may be made to represent a skull, dog’s\r\nhead, an owl, or some other simple figure. The inside is hollowed out to\r\nreceive a \"pea\" lamp. Pea lamps with a cord and a plug attached as shown\r\nin Figure 300 may be purchased from almost any electrical supply house.\r\nThe lamp is a miniature carbon bulb about one-eighth of an inch in\r\ndiameter. The eyes, nose, and mouth of the figure are pierced with small\r\nholes, so that when the lamp is lighted the light will show through the\r\nholes. The figure should be carved down thin enough to be translucent\r\nand light up nicely.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 300.—A \"Pea\" Lamp attached to a Flexible Wire and a\r\nPlug.]\r\n\r\nA large pin is cemented or otherwise fastened to the back of the figure\r\nso that it can be placed on the necktie or the lapel of the coat. The\r\nlamp is removed from the socket of an electric flashlight and the plug\r\nattached to the pea lamp screwed into its place. The pea lamp is\r\ninserted inside the figure and bound in place with some silk thread.\r\nThen when the button is pressed on the flashlight case, the pin will\r\nlight up and tiny beams of light will shoot out from the eyes, nose, and\r\nmouth of the figure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 301.—Four Steps in Carving a Skull Scarf-Pin. 1. The\r\nBone. 2. Hole drilled in Base. 3. Roughed out. 4. Finished.]\r\n\r\nThe drawings in Figure 301 show how to carve a skull scarf-pin. It is\r\nmade from a cylindrical piece of bone about five-eighths of an inch long\r\nand three-eighths of an inch in diameter. The first operation is to\r\ndrill a hole three-eighths of an inch deep into the bottom. The hole\r\nshould be large enough in diameter to pass the pea lamp.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 302.—The Completed Pin ready to be connected to a\r\nBattery by removing the Lamp from a Flashlight and screwing the Plug\r\ninto its Place.]\r\n\r\nThen carve the eyes and nose and teeth. The drawings will give a good\r\nidea of the steps in this part of the work. Next round off the top of\r\nthe skull. Bore a small hole in the back to receive the pin. Put the\r\nlight inside of the skull, and after it is bound in position the\r\nscarf-pin is finished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX MISCELLANEOUS ELECTRICAL APPARATUS\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW ELECTRICITY MAY BE GENERATED FROM HEAT\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the past century there has been on the part of many scientists and\r\ninventors a constant endeavor to \"harness the sunlight.\" The power which\r\nstreams down every day to our planet is incalculable. The energy\r\nconsumed in the sun and thrown off in the form of heat is so great that\r\nit makes any earthly thing seem infinitesimal. We can only feel the heat\r\nfrom a large fire a few feet away, yet the scorching summer heat travels\r\n90,000,000 miles before it reaches us, and even then our planet is\r\nreceiving only the smallest fractional part of the total amount\r\nradiated.\r\n\r\nDr. Langley of the Smithsonian Institute estimated that all the coal in\r\nthe State of Pennsylvania would be used by the sun in a fraction of a\r\nsecond if it were sent up there to supply energy.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, some day in the future, electric locomotives will haul their\r\nsteel cars swiftly from city to city by means of electricity, generated\r\nwith \"sun power.\" Perhaps energy from the same source will heat our\r\ndwellings and furnish us light and power.\r\n\r\nThis is not an idle dream, but may some day be an actuality. It has\r\nalready been carried out to some extent. A Massachusetts inventor has\r\nsucceeded in making a device for generating electricity from sun energy.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus consists of a large frame, in appearance very much like a\r\nwindow. The glass panes are made of violet glass, behind which are many\r\nhundred little metallic plugs. The sun’s heat, imprisoned by the violet\r\nglass, acts on the plugs to produce electricity. One of these generators\r\nexposed to the sun for ten hours will charge a storage battery and\r\nproduce enough current to run 30 large tungsten lamps for three days.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 303.—How the Copper Wires (_C_) and the Silver Wires\r\n(_I_) are twisted together in Pairs.]\r\n\r\nThe principle upon which the apparatus works was discovered by a\r\nscientist named Seebeck, in 1822. He succeeded in producing a current of\r\nelectricity by heating the points of contact between two dissimilar\r\nmetals.\r\n\r\nAny boy can make a similar apparatus, which, while not giving enough\r\ncurrent for any practical purpose, will serve as an exceedingly\r\ninteresting and instructive experiment.\r\n\r\nCut forty or fifty pieces of No. 16 B. & S. gauge German silver wire\r\ninto five-inch pieces. Cut an equal number of similar pieces of copper\r\nwire, and twist each German silver wire firmly together with one of\r\ncopper so as to form a zig-zag arrangement as in Figure 303.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 304.—Wooden Ring.]\r\n\r\nNext make two wooden rings about four inches in diameter by cutting them\r\nout of a pine board. Place the wires on one of the rings in the manner\r\nshown in Figure 305. Place the second ring on top and clamp it down by\r\nmeans of two or three screws.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 305.—Complete Thermopile. An Alcohol Lamp should be\r\nlighted and placed so that the Flame heats the Inside Ends of the Wires\r\nin the Center of the Wooden Ring.]\r\n\r\nThe inner junctures of the wires must not touch each other. The outer\r\nends should be bent out straight and be spaced equidistantly. The ring\r\nshould be supported by three iron rods or legs. The two terminals of the\r\nthermopile as the instrument is called, should be connected to\r\nbinding-posts.\r\n\r\nPlace a small alcohol lamp or Bunsen burner in the center, so that the\r\nflame will play on the inner junctures of the wires. A thermopile of the\r\nsize and type just described will deliver a considerable amount of\r\nelectrical energy when the inside terminals are good and hot and the\r\noutside terminals fairly good.\r\n\r\nThe current may be very easily detected by connecting the terminals to a\r\ntelephone receiver or galvanometer. By making several thermopiles and\r\nconnecting them in parallel, sufficient current can be obtained to light\r\na small lamp.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO MAKE A REFLECTOSCOPE\r\n\r\n\r\nA reflectoscope is a very simple form of a \"magic lantern\" with which it\r\nis possible to show pictures from post-cards, photographs, etc. The\r\nordinary magic lantern requires a transparent lantern slide, but the\r\nreflectoscope will make pictures from almost anything. The picture\r\npost-cards or the photographs that you have collected during your\r\nvacation may be thrown on a screen and magnified to three or four feet\r\nin diameter. Illustrations clipped from a magazine or newspaper or an\r\noriginal sketch or painting will likewise show just as well. Everything\r\nis projected in its actual colors. If you put your watch in the back of\r\nthe lantern, with the wheels and works exposed, it will show all the\r\nmetallic colors and the parts in motion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 306.—A Reflectoscope.]\r\n\r\nThe reflectoscope, shown in Figure 306, consists of a rectangular box\r\nnine inches long, six inches wide, and six inches high outside. It may\r\nbe built of sheet-iron or tin, but is most easily made from wood. Boards\r\nthree-eighths of an inch thick are heavy enough. The methods of making\r\nan ordinary box are too simple to need description. The box or case in\r\nthis instance, however, must be carefully made and be \"light-tight,\"\r\nthat is, as explained before, it must not contain any cracks or small\r\nholes which will allow light to escape if a lamp is placed inside.\r\n\r\nA round hole from two and one-half to three inches in diameter is cut in\r\nthe center of one of the faces of the box.\r\n\r\nThe exact diameter cannot be given here because it will be determined by\r\nthe lens which the experimenter is able to secure for his reflectoscope.\r\nOnly one lens is required. It must be of the \"double-convex\" variety,\r\nand be from two and one-half to three inches in diameter. A lens is very\r\neasily secured from an old bicycle lantern. It should be of clear glass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 307.—How the Lens is Arranged and Mounted.]\r\n\r\nA tube, six inches long and of the proper diameter to fit tightly around\r\nthe lens, must be made by rolling up a piece of sheet-tin and soldering\r\nthe edges together. This tube is the one labeled \"movable tube\" in the\r\nillustrations. A second tube, three inches long and of the proper\r\ndiameter to just slip over the first tube, must also be made. A flat\r\nring cut from stiff sheet-brass is soldered around the outside of this\r\nsecond tube, so that it may be fastened to the front of the case by\r\nthree or four small screws in the manner shown. The hole in the front of\r\nthe box should be only large enough to receive the tube.\r\n\r\nThe lens is held in position near one end of the movable tube by two\r\nstrong wire rings. These rings should be made of wire that is heavy and\r\nrather springy, so that they will tend to open against the sides of the\r\ntube. It is a good plan to solder one of them in position, so that it\r\ncannot move, and then put in the lens. After the lens is in position,\r\nthe second ring should be put in and pushed down against the lens. Do\r\nnot attempt to put the lens in, however, until you are sure that the\r\nmetal has cooled again after soldering, or it will be liable to crack.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 308.—A View of the Reflectoscope from the Rear,\r\nshowing the Door, etc.]\r\n\r\nThe back of the box contains a small hinged door about four inches high\r\nand five and one-half inches long. The pictures that it is desired to\r\nproject on the screen are held against this door by two small brass\r\nclips, as shown in Figure 308.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 309.—A View of the Reflectoscope with the Cover\r\nremoved, showing the Arrangement of the Lamps, etc.]\r\n\r\nThe light for the reflectoscope is most conveniently made by two\r\n16-candle-power electric incandescent lamps. Figure 309 shows a view of\r\nthe inside of the box with the cover removed, looking directly down. The\r\nlamps fit into ordinary flat-base porcelain receptacles, such as that\r\nshown in Figure 310. Two of these receptacles are required, one for each\r\nlamp. They cost about ten cents each.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 310.—A Socket for holding the Lamp.]\r\n\r\nThe reflectors are made of tin, bent as shown in Figure 311. They are\r\nfastened in position behind the lamps by four small tabs.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to fit a reflectoscope with gas or oil lamp to supply the\r\nlight, but in that case the box will have to be made much larger, and\r\nprovided with chimneys to carry off the hot air.\r\n\r\nThe interior of the reflectoscope must be painted a dead black by using\r\na paint made by mixing lampblack and turpentine. The interior also\r\nincludes the inside of the tin tubes.\r\n\r\nThe electric current is led into the lamps with a piece of flexible\r\nlamp-cord passing through a small hole in the case. An attachment-plug\r\nis fitted to the other end of the cord, so that it may be screwed into\r\nany convenient lamp-socket.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 311.—The Tin Reflector.]\r\n\r\nThe pictures should be shown in a dark room and projected on a smooth\r\nwhite sheet. They are placed under the spring clips on the little door\r\nand the door closed. The movable tube is then slid back and forth until\r\nthe picture on the screen becomes clear and distinct.\r\n\r\nThe lantern may be improved considerably by using tungsten lamps of 22\r\nc. p. each in place of ordinary c. p. carbon filament lamps.\r\n\r\nIf four small feet, one at each corner, are attached to the bottom of\r\nthe case, its appearance will be much improved.\r\n\r\nVery large pictures will tend to appear a little blurred at the corners.\r\nThis is due to the lens and cannot be easily remedied.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO REDUCE THE 110-v. CURRENT SO THAT IT MAY BE USED FOR\r\nEXPERIMENTING\r\n\r\n\r\nOftentimes it is desirable to operate small electrical devices from the\r\n110-v. lighting or power circuits. Alternating current can be reduced to\r\nthe proper voltage by means of a small step-down transformer, such as\r\nthat described in Chapter XIII. Direct current may be reduced by means\r\nof a resistance. The most suitable form of resistance for the young\r\nexperimenter to use is a \"lamp bank.\"\r\n\r\nA lamp bank consists of a number of lamps connected in parallel, and\r\narranged so that any device may be connected in series with it.\r\n\r\nThe lamps are set in sockets of the type known as \"flat-base porcelain\r\nreceptacles,\" such as that shown in Figure 310, mounted in a row upon a\r\nboard and connected as shown in Fig. 312.\r\n\r\nThe current from the power line enters through a switch and a fuse and\r\nthen passes through the lamps before it reaches the device it is desired\r\nto operate. The switch is for the purpose of shutting the current on and\r\noff, while the fuse will \"blow\" in case too much current flows in the\r\ncircuit.\r\n\r\nThe amount of current that passes through the circuit may be accurately\r\ncontrolled by the size and number of lamps used in the bank. The lamps\r\nmay be screwed in or out and the current altered by one-quarter of an\r\nampere at a time if desirable.\r\n\r\nThe lamps should be of the same voltage as the line upon which they are\r\nto be used. Each 8-candle-power, 110-v. carbon lamp used will permit\r\none-quarter of an ampere to pass. Each 16-candle-power, 110-v. lamp will\r\npass approximately one-half an ampere. A 32-candle-power lamp of the\r\nsame voltage will permit one ampere to flow in the circuit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 312.—Top View of Lamp Bank, showing how the Circuit\r\nis arranged. A and B are the Posts to which should be connected any\r\nDevice it‘s desirable to operate.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAN INDUCTION MOTOR\r\n\r\n\r\n*An Induction Motor* is a motor in which the currents in the armature\r\nwindings are _induced_. An induction motor runs without any brushes, and\r\nthe current from the power line is connected only to the field. The\r\nfield might be likened to the primary of a transformer. The currents in\r\nthe armature then constitute a secondary winding in which currents are\r\ninduced in the same manner as in a transformer.\r\n\r\nAn induction motor will operate only on alternating current.\r\n\r\nA small motor such as that shown in Figure 267, and having a three-pole\r\narmature, is the best type to use in making an experimental induction\r\nmotor.\r\n\r\nRemove the brushes from the motor and bind a piece of bare copper wire\r\naround the commutator so that it short-circuits the segments.\r\n\r\nA source of alternating current should then be connected to the\r\nterminals of the field coil. If you have a step-down transformer, use it\r\nfor this purpose, but otherwise connect it in series with a lamp bank\r\nsuch as that just described.\r\n\r\nPlace a switch in the circuit so that the current may be turned on and\r\noff. Wind a string around the end of the armature shaft so that it may\r\nbe revolved at high speed by pulling the string in somewhat the same\r\nmanner that you would spin a top. When all is ready, give the string a\r\nsharp pull and immediately close the switch so that the alternating\r\ncurrent flows into the field.\r\n\r\nIf this is done properly, the motor will continue to run at high speed,\r\nand furnish power if desirable.\r\n\r\nMost of the alternating-current motors in every-day use for furnishing\r\npower for various purposes are induction motors. They are, however,\r\nself-starting, and provided with a hollow armature, which contains a\r\ncentrifugal governor. When the motor is at rest or just starting, four\r\nbrushes press against the commutator and divide the armature coils into\r\nfour groups. After the motor has attained the proper speed, the governor\r\nis thrown out by centrifugal force and pushes the brushes away from the\r\ncommutator, short-circuiting all the sections and making each coil a\r\ncomplete circuit of itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTRO-PLATING\r\n\r\n\r\nWater containing chemicals such as sulphate of copper, sulphuric acid,\r\nnitrate of nickel, nitrate of silver, or other metallic salts is a good\r\nconductor of electricity. Such a liquid is known as an _electrolyte_.\r\n\r\nIt has been explained in Chapter IV that chemical action may be used to\r\nproduce electricity and that in the case of a cell such as that invented\r\nby Volta, the zinc electrode gradually wastes away and finally enters\r\ninto solution in the sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\nIt is possible exactly to reverse this action and to produce what is\r\nknown as _electrolysis_. If an electrolyte in which a metal has been\r\n\"dissolved\" is properly arranged so that a current of electricity may be\r\npassed through the solution, the metal will \"plate out,\" or appear again\r\nupon one of the electrodes.\r\n\r\nElectrolysis makes possible electro-plating and thousands of other\r\nexceedingly valuable and interesting chemical processes.\r\n\r\nMore than one-half of all the copper produced in the world is produced\r\n_electrolytically_.\r\n\r\nPractically all plating with gold, silver, copper and nickel is\r\naccomplished with the aid of electricity.\r\n\r\nThese operations are carried out on a very large scale in the various\r\nfactories, but it is possible to reproduce them in any boy’s workshop or\r\nlaboratory, with very simple equipment.\r\n\r\nThe proper chemicals, a tank, and a battery are the only apparatus\r\nrequired. The current must be supplied by storage cells or a bichromate\r\nbattery because the work will require five or six amperes for quite a\r\nlong period.\r\n\r\nA small rectangular glass jar will make a first class tank to hold the\r\nelectrolyte.\r\n\r\nThe simplest electro-plating process, and the one that the experimenter\r\nshould start with is copper-plating.\r\n\r\nFill the tank three-quarters full of pure water and then drop in some\r\ncrystals of copper-sulphate until the liquid has a deep blue color and\r\nwill dissolve no more.\r\n\r\nObtain two copper rods and lay them across the tank. Cut two pieces of\r\nsheet copper having a tongue at each of two corners so that they can be\r\nhung in the solution, as shown in Figure 313. Hang both of the sheets\r\nfrom one of the copper rods. Connect this rod to the _positive_ pole of\r\nthe battery. These sheets are known as the anodes.\r\n\r\nThen if a piece of carbon, or some metallic object is hung from the\r\nother rod and connected to the _negative_ pole of the battery, the\r\nelectro-plating will commence. The apparatus should be allowed to run\r\nfor about half an hour and then the object hung from the rod connected\r\nto the negative pole of the battery should be lifted out and examined.\r\nIt will be found thickly coated with copper. It is absolutely necessary\r\nto have the poles of the battery connected in the manner stated, or no\r\ndeposit of copper will take place.\r\n\r\nObjects which are to be electro-plated must be free from all traces of\r\noil or grease and absolutely clean in every respect, or the plating will\r\nnot be uniform, because it will not stick to dirty spots.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 313.—A Glass Jar arranged to serve as an\r\nElectro-Plating Tank.]\r\n\r\nSuch articles as keys, key-rings, tools, etc., can be prevented from\r\nrusting by coating with nickel.\r\n\r\nNickel-plating is very similar to copper-plating. Instead, however, of\r\nhaving two copper sheets suspended from the rod connected to the\r\npositive pole of the battery, they must be made of nickel.\r\n\r\nThe electrolyte is composed of one part of nickel-sulphate dissolved in\r\ntwenty parts of water to which one part of sodium-bisulphate is added.\r\n\r\nThis mixture is placed in the tank instead of the copper-sulphate. The\r\nobjects to be plated are hung from the copper rod connected to the\r\nnegative pole of the battery.\r\n\r\nWhen the nickel-plated articles are removed from the bath they will have\r\na dull, white color known as \"white nickel.\" When white nickel is\r\npolished with a cloth wheel revolving at high speed, and known as a\r\nbuffing-wheel, it will assume a high luster.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO MAKE A RHEOSTAT\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is often desirable to regulate the amount of current passing through\r\na small lamp, motor, or other electrical device operated by a battery.\r\n\r\nThis is accomplished by inserting resistance into the circuit. A\r\nrheostat is an arrangement for quickly altering the amount of resistance\r\nat will.\r\n\r\nA simple rheostat is easily made by fitting a five-point switch such as\r\nthat shown in Figure 95 with several coils of German-silver resistance\r\nwire. German silver has much more resistance than copper wire, and is\r\nused, therefore, because less will be required, and it will occupy a\r\nsmaller space.\r\n\r\nA five-point switch will serve satisfactorily in making a rheostat, but\r\nif a finer graduation of the resistance is desired it will be necessary\r\nto use one having more points.\r\n\r\nTwo lines of small wire nails are driven around the outside of the\r\npoints, and a German-silver wire of No. 24 B. & S. gauge wound in\r\nzig-zag fashion around the nails from one point to the other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 314.—A Rheostat.]\r\n\r\nThe rheostat is placed in series with any device it is desirable to\r\ncontrol. When the handle is on the point to the extreme left, the\r\nrheostat offers no resistance to the current. When the lever is placed\r\non the second point, the current has to traverse the first section of\r\nthe German-silver wire and will be appreciably affected. Moving the\r\nhandle to the right will increase the resistance.\r\n\r\nIf the rheostat is connected to a motor, the speed can be increased or\r\ndecreased by moving the lever back and forth.\r\n\r\nIn the same manner, the light from a small incandescent lamp may be\r\ndimmed or increased.\r\n\r\n\r\nA CURRENT REVERSER OR POLE-CHANGING SWITCH\r\n\r\n\r\nA pole-changing or current reversing switch is useful to the\r\nexperimenter. For example, if connected to a small motor, the motor can\r\nbe made to run in either direction at will. A motor with a permanent\r\nmagnet field can be reversed by merely changing the wires from the\r\nbattery so that the current flows through the circuit in the opposite\r\ndirection. If the motor is provided with a field winding, however, the\r\nonly way that it can be made to run either way is by reversing the\r\nfield. This is best accomplished with a pole-changing switch.\r\n\r\nSuch a switch may be made by following the same general method of\r\nconstruction as that outlined on pages 107 and 108, but making it\r\naccording to the design shown in Figure 315.\r\n\r\nMotors such as those illustrated can be made to reverse by connecting to\r\na pole-changing switch in the proper manner.\r\n\r\nThe two outside points or contacts (marked _D_ and _D_) should both be\r\nconnected to one of the brushes on the motor. The middle contact, _C_,\r\nis connected to the other brush.\r\n\r\nOne terminal of the field is connected to the battery. The other\r\nterminal of the field is connected to the lever, _A_. _B_ connects to\r\nthe other terminal of the battery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 315.—A Pole-Changing Switch or Current Reverser. The\r\nConnecting Strip is pivoted so that the Handle will operate both the\r\nLevers, A and B.]\r\n\r\nWhen the switch handle is pushed to the left, the lever _A_ should rest\r\non the left-hand contact, _D_. The lever _B_ should make contact with\r\n_C_. The motor will then run in one direction. If the handle is pushed\r\nto the right so that the levers _A_ and _B_ make contact respectively\r\nwith _C_ and _D_ (right-hand), the motor will reverse and run in the\r\nopposite direction.\r\n\r\n\r\nA COMPLETE WIRELESS RECEIVING SET\r\n\r\n\r\nMany experimenters may wish to build a wireless receiving set which is\r\npermanently connected and in which the instruments are so mounted that\r\nthey are readily portable and may be easily shifted from one place to\r\nanother without having to disturb a number of wires.\r\n\r\nThe receiving set shown in Figure 316 is made up of some of the separate\r\ninstruments described in Chapter XIV, and illustrates the general plan\r\nwhich may be followed in arranging an outfit in this manner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMPLETE RECEIVING SET, CONSISTING OF DOUBLE SLIDER\r\nTUNING COIL, DETECTOR AND FIXED CONDENSER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMPLETE RECEIVING SET, CONSISTING OF A LOOSE COUPLER IN\r\nPLACE OF THE TUNING COIL, DETECTOR AND FIXED CONDENSER.]\r\n\r\nThe base is of wood, and is nine inches long, seven inches wide, and\r\none-half of an inch thick.\r\n\r\nA double-slider tuning coil, similar to that shown in Figure 203, is\r\nfastened to the back part of the base by two small wood-screws passing\r\nupwards through the base into the tuner heads.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 316. A Complete Wireless Receiving Outfit.]\r\n\r\nThe fixed condenser is enclosed in a rectangular wooden block which is\r\nhollowed out underneath to receive it and then screwed down to the base\r\nin the forward right-hand corner.\r\n\r\nThe detector is mounted in the forward left-hand part of the base, and\r\nin the illustration is shown as being similar to that in Figure 210. Any\r\ntype of detector may, however, be substituted.\r\n\r\nThe tuning coil may be replaced by a loose coupler if desirable, but in\r\nthat case the base will have to be made larger.\r\n\r\nThe telephone receivers are connected to two binding-posts mounted\r\nalongside the detector.\r\n\r\nThe circuit shown in Figure 218 is the one which should be followed in\r\nwiring the set. The wires which connect the various instruments should\r\nbe passed through holes and along the under side of the base so that\r\nthey are concealed.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO BUILD A TESLA HIGH-FREQUENCY COIL\r\n\r\n\r\nA Tesla high-frequency coil or transformer opens a field of wonderful\r\npossibilities for the amateur experimenter. Innumerable weird and\r\nfascinating experiments can be performed with its aid.\r\n\r\nWhen a Leyden jar or a condenser discharges through a coil of wire, the\r\nspark which can be seen does not consist simply of a single spark\r\npassing in one direction, as it appears to the eye, but in reality is a\r\nnumber of separate sparks alternately passing in opposite directions.\r\nThey move so rapidly that the eye is unable to distinguish them. The\r\ntime during which the spark appears to pass may only be a fraction of a\r\nsecond, but during that short period the current may have oscillated\r\nback and forth several thousand times.\r\n\r\nIf the discharge from such a Leyden jar or a condenser is passed through\r\na coil of wire acting as a _primary_, and the primary is provided with a\r\n_secondary_ coil containing a larger number of turns, the secondary will\r\nproduce a peculiar current known as _high-frequency_ electricity.\r\nHigh-frequency currents reverse their direction of flow or _alternate_\r\nfrom one hundred thousand to one million times a second.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 317.—Illustrating the Principle of the Tesla Coil. A\r\nLeyden Jar discharges through the Primary Coil and a High-Frequency\r\nSpark is produced at the Secondary.]\r\n\r\nHigh-frequency currents possess many curious properties. They travel\r\nonly on the surface of wires and conductors. A hollow tube is just as\r\ngood a conductor for high-frequency currents as a solid rod of the same\r\ndiameter. High-frequency currents do not produce a shock. If you hold a\r\npiece of metal in your hand you can take the shock from a high-frequency\r\ncoil throwing a spark two or three feet long with scarcely any sensation\r\nsave that of a slight warmth.\r\n\r\nThe Tesla coil described below is of a size best adapted for use with a\r\ntwo-inch or three-inch spark coil, or a small high-potential wireless\r\ntransformer. The purpose of the spark coil or the transformer is to\r\ncharge the Leyden jars or condenser which discharge through the primary\r\nof the Tesla coil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 318.—Details of the Wooden Rings used as the Primary\r\nHeads.]\r\n\r\nIf the young experimenter wishes to make a Tesla coil which will be\r\nsuited to a smaller spark coil, for instance, one capable of giving a\r\none-inch spark, the dimensions of the Tesla coil herein described can be\r\ncut exactly in half. Instead of making the secondary twelve inches long\r\nand three inches in diameter, make it six inches long and one and\r\none-half inches in diameter, etc.\r\n\r\n*The Primary* consists of eight turns of No. 10 B. & S. gauge copper\r\nwire wound around a drum. The heads of the drum are wooden rings, seven\r\ninches in diameter and one-half inch thick. A circular hole four and\r\none-half inches in diameter is cut in the center of each of the heads.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 319.—Details of the Cross Bars which support the\r\nPrimary Winding.]\r\n\r\nThe cross bars are two and one-half inches long, three-quarters of an\r\ninch thick and one-half of an inch wide. Six cross bars are required.\r\nThey are spaced at equal distances around the rings and fastened by\r\nmeans of a _brass_ screw passing through the ring. When the drum is\r\ncompleted it should resemble a \"squirrel cage.\"\r\n\r\nSmall grooves are cut in the cross bars to accommodate the wire. The\r\nwires should pass around the drum in the form of a spiral and be spaced\r\nabout five-sixteenths of an inch apart.\r\n\r\nThe ends of the wire should be fastened to binding-posts mounted on the\r\nheads.\r\n\r\n*The Secondary* is a single layer of No. 26 B. & S. silk- or\r\ncotton-covered wire wound over a cardboard tube, twelve inches long and\r\nthree inches in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe tube should be dried in an oven and then given a thick coat of\r\nshellac, both inside and out, before it is used. This treatment will\r\nprevent it from shrinkage and avoid the possibility of having to rewind\r\nthe tube in case the wire should become loose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 320.—The Secondary Head.]\r\n\r\nThe secondary is fitted with two circular wooden heads just large enough\r\nto fit tightly into the tube, having a half-inch flange, and an outside\r\ndiameter of three and seven-eighths inches.\r\n\r\n*The Base* of the coil is fifteen inches long and six inches wide and is\r\nmade of wood.\r\n\r\nThe coil is assembled by placing the primary across the base and exactly\r\nin the center. Two long wood-screws passing through the base and into\r\nthe primary heads will hold it firmly in position.\r\n\r\nThe secondary is passed through the center of the primary and supported\r\nin that position by two hard rubber supports, four inches high,\r\nseven-eighths of an inch wide and one-half of an inch thick. A brass\r\nwood-screw is passed through the top part of each of the supports into\r\nthe secondary heads so that a line drawn through the axis of the\r\nsecondary will coincide with a similar line drawn through the axis of\r\nthe primary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A COMPLETE COHERER OUTFIT AS DESCRIBED ON PAGE 274.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TESLA HIGH FREQUENCY COIL.]\r\n\r\nThe supports are made of hard rubber instead of wood, because the rubber\r\nhas a greater insulating value than the wood. High-frequency currents\r\nare very hard to insulate, and wood does not usually offer sufficient\r\ninsulation.\r\n\r\nA brass rod, five inches long and having a small brass ball at one end,\r\nis mounted on the top of each of the hard-rubber supports. The ends of\r\nthe secondary winding are connected to the brass rods.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 321.—End View of the Complete Tesla Coil.]\r\n\r\nThe lower end of each of the hard-rubber supports is fastened to the\r\nbase by means of a screw passing through the base into the support.\r\n\r\nIn order to operate the Tesla coil, the primary should be connected in\r\nseries with a condenser and a spark-gap as shown in Figure 324. The\r\ncondenser may consist of a number of Leyden jars or of several glass\r\nplates coated with tinfoil. It is impossible to determine the number\r\nrequired ahead of time, because the length of the connecting wires, the\r\nspark-gap, etc., will have considerable influence upon the amount of\r\ncondenser required. The condenser is connected directly across the\r\nsecondary terminals of the spark coil.\r\n\r\nWhen the spark coil is connected to a battery and set into operation, a\r\nsnappy, white spark should jump across the spark-gap.\r\n\r\nIf the hand is brought close to one of the secondary terminals of the\r\nTesla coil, a small reddish-purple spark will jump out to meet the\r\nfinger.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 322.—The Complete Tesla Coil.]\r\n\r\nAdjusting the spark-gap by changing its length and also altering the\r\nnumber of Leyden jars of condenser plates will probably increase the\r\nlength of the high-frequency spark. It may be possible also to lengthen\r\nthe spark by disconnecting one of the wires from the primary\r\nbinding-posts on the Tesla coil and connecting the wire directly to one\r\nof any one of the turns forming the primary. In this way the number of\r\nturns in the primary is changed and the circuit is _tuned_ in the same\r\nway that wireless apparatus is tuned by changing the number of turns in\r\nthe tuning coil or helix.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 323.—Showing how a Glass-Plate Condenser is built up\r\nof Alternate Sheets of Tinfoil and Glass.]\r\n\r\nThe weird beauty of a Tesla coil is only evident when it is operated in\r\nthe dark. The two wires leading from the secondary to the brass rods and\r\nthe ball on the ends of the rods will give forth a peculiar _brush_\r\ndischarge.\r\n\r\nIf you take a piece of metal in your hand and hold it near one of the\r\nsecondary terminals, the brushing will increase. If you hold your hand\r\nnear enough, a spark will jump on to the metal and into your body\r\nwithout your feeling the slightest sensation.\r\n\r\nIf one of the secondary terminals of the Tesla coil is _grounded_ by\r\nmeans of a wire connecting it to the primary, the brushing at the other\r\nterminal will increase considerably.\r\n\r\nMake two rings out of copper wire. One of them should be six inches in\r\ndiameter and the other one four inches in diameter. Place the small ring\r\ninside the large one and connect them to the secondary terminals. The\r\ntwo circles should be arranged so as to be _concentric_, that is, so\r\nthat they have a common center.\r\n\r\nThe space between the two coils will be filled with a pretty brush\r\ndischarge when the coil is in operation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 324.—A Diagram showing the Proper Method of\r\nConnecting a Tesla Coil.]\r\n\r\nThere are so many other experiments which may be performed with a Tesla\r\ncoil that it is impossible even to think of describing them here, and\r\nthe young experimenter wishing to continue the work further is advised\r\nto go to some library and consult the works of Nikola Tesla, wherein\r\nsuch experiments are fully explained.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nUnless the average boy has materially changed his habits, in recent\r\nyears, it matters not what the preface of a book may contain, for it\r\nwill be unceremoniously skipped with hardly more than a passing glance.\r\nWith this in mind, the author has tried to \"steal a march\" on you, and\r\ninstead of writing a longer preface, and including some material which\r\nmight properly belong in that place, has added it here in the nature of\r\na conclusion, thinking that you would be more likely to read it last\r\nthan first.\r\n\r\nSome time ago, when in search for something that might be described in\r\nthis book, I thought of some old boxes into which my things had been\r\npacked when I had dismantled my workshop before going away to college.\r\nThey had been undisturbed for a number of years and I had almost\r\nforgotten where they had been put. At last a large box was unearthed\r\nfrom amongst a lot of dusty furniture put away in the attic. I pried the\r\ncover off and took the things out one by one and laid them on the floor.\r\nHere were galvanometers, microphones, switches, telegraph keys,\r\nsounders, relays, and other things too numerous to mention. They had all\r\nbeen constructed so long ago that I was considerably amused and\r\ninterested in the manner in which bolts, screws, pieces of curtain rod,\r\nsheet-iron, brass, and other things had been taken to form various parts\r\nof the instruments. The binding-posts had almost in every case seen\r\nservice as such on dry cells before they came into my hands. The only\r\nparts that it had been necessary to buy were a few round-headed brass\r\nscrews and the wire which formed the magnets. In several instances, the\r\nlatter were made so that they might be easily removed and mounted upon\r\nanother instrument. The magnets on the telegraph sounder could be\r\nremoved and fitted to form part of an electric engine or motor.\r\n\r\nOne particular thing which struck me very forcibly was the lack of\r\nfinish and the crudeness which most of the instruments showed.\r\n\r\nOf course it was impossible to avoid the clumsy appearance which the\r\nmetal parts possessed, since they were not originally made for the part\r\nthat they were playing, but I wished that I had taken a little more care\r\nto true up things properly or to smooth and varnish the wood, or that I\r\nhad removed the tool-marks and dents from the metal work by a little\r\nfiling.\r\n\r\nIf I had done so, I should now be distinctly proud of my work. That is\r\nnot to say that I am in the least ashamed of it, for my old traps\r\ncertainly served their purpose well, even if they were not ornamental\r\nand were better back in their box. Perhaps I might be excused for\r\nfailing in this part of the work through lack of proper tools, and also\r\nbecause at that time there were no magazines or books published which\r\nexplained how to do such things, and when I built my first tuning coils\r\nand detectors nothing on that subject had ever been published. I had to\r\nwork out such problems for myself, and gave more thought to the\r\nprinciples upon which the instruments operated than to their actual\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\nThe boys who read this book have the advantage of instructions showing\r\nhow to build apparatus that has actually been built and tested. You know\r\nwhat size of wire to use and will not have to find it out for yourself.\r\nFor that reason you ought to be able to give more time to the\r\nconstruction of such things. The purpose of this conclusion is simply a\r\nplea for better work. The American boy is usually careless in this\r\nregard. He often commences to build something and then, growing tired\r\nbefore it is finished, lays it aside only to forget it and undertake\r\nsomething else. _Finish whatever you undertake_. The principle is a good\r\none. Remember also that care with the little details is what insures\r\nsuccess in the whole.\r\n\r\nIf in carrying out your work, you get an idea, do not hesitate to try\r\nit. A good idea never refused to be developed. It is not necessary to\r\nstick absolutely to the directions that I have given. They will insure\r\nsuccess if followed, but if you think you can make an improvement, do\r\nso.\r\n\r\nOf course, such a book as this cannot, in the nature of things, be\r\nexhaustive, nor is it desirable, in one sense, that it should be.\r\n\r\nI have tried to write a book which, considered as a whole, would prove\r\nto be exhaustive only in that it treats of almost every phase of\r\npractical electricity.\r\n\r\nThe principle in mind has been to produce a work which would stimulate\r\nthe inventive faculties in boys, and to guide them until face to face\r\nwith those practical emergencies in which no book can be of any\r\nassistance but which must be overcome by common sense and the exercise\r\nof personal ingenuity.\r\n\r\nThe book is not as free from technical terms or phrases, as it lay in my\r\npower to make it, because certain of those terms have a value and an\r\nevery-day use which are a benefit to the young experimenter who\r\nunderstands them.\r\n\r\nAny one subject treated in the various chapters of the \"Boy Electrician\"\r\nmay be developed far beyond that point to which I have taken it. The\r\nrailroad system could be fitted with electric signals, drawbridges, and\r\na number of other devices.\r\n\r\nMany new ideas suggest themselves to the ready-witted American boy. I\r\nshall always be pleased to hear from any boy who builds any of the\r\napparatus I have described, and, if possible, to receive photographs of\r\nthe work. I should be glad to be of any assistance to such a lad, but\r\nremember that some of the drawings and text in this book required many\r\nhours even to complete a small portion, and therefore please do not\r\nwrite to ask how to build other apparatus not described herein. And, as\r\nthe future years bring new inventions and discoveries, no one now knows\r\nbut that, some day, perhaps I will write another \"Boy Electrician.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.",
