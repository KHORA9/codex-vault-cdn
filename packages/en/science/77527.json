  "content": "Keepers of the House\r\n\r\nby Lester del Rey\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _So bewildering in scope is the entertainment field that even a\r\n  well-known writer may find himself deflated by the disconcerting\r\n  query: “Just what magazines do you write for?” But there is\r\n  little danger of such a calamity overtaking Lester del Rey, for\r\n  his contributions to science fantasy have been so numerous and\r\n  outstanding that the field of his choice would look crater-pitted\r\n  without them. And this, his newest story, is one of his very best._\r\n\r\n  =King could remember how golden and glorious the house had seemed\r\n  to men-and what the science he hated had done to his friends.=\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOutwardly, there was nothing about that particular morning to set it\r\napart from the thousands of other such mornings which the dog had\r\nsmelled. Yet his great, gaunt body shifted nervously on the rocky shelf\r\nover the river, and his short hackles lifted slightly as the skin on\r\nhis neck tautened. He raised his head, sniffing the wind that blew\r\nfrom the land, and his ears searched for wrongness in the sounds that\r\nreached him. Once he whined.\r\n\r\nThe feeling left from the dream was still troubling him. He had bedded\r\ndown in a dry shelter back from the water. After he had scraped away\r\nthe ancient, dried bones of rabbits, it had seemed like a good place.\r\nBut sleep had been too busy, full of running and of tantalizing smells.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, just when he was tearing at something with an almost\r\nforgotten flavor, the warm scent in his nostrils had changed to\r\nanother, and a voice had snapped into his ears. He had jerked awake,\r\nshivering, with the name still ringing in his head.\r\n\r\n“King!”\r\n\r\nThe dream memory of Doc had bothered him before, but this time even the\r\nwarmth of the sun had failed to quiet it, though his nose reported no\r\ntrace of a human odor now. There was something about this territory....\r\n\r\nAbruptly, a motion in the water caught his attention. He edged forward,\r\nrising to his feet, while his eyes tracked the big fish. Overhead, a\r\nbird must have seen the same prey, since it began dropping.\r\n\r\nKing growled faintly and plunged down into the unpleasant chill of the\r\nwater. Necessity and decades of near-starvation had taught him perfect\r\nform in this unnatural act. A moment later, he was heading for shore\r\nwith the fish clamped between his jaws.\r\n\r\nHe found a hollowed spot of dry sand, shook the water out of his short\r\nfur, and began tearing at the fish. It was a flavorless breakfast,\r\nfar inferior to the big salmon that were so easy to catch along the\r\nnorthwestern rivers, but it filled him well enough.\r\n\r\nThe wind was growing stronger, reminding him of the cold that was\r\ncreeping down from the north as it seemed to do at regular intervals.\r\nEach year, the cold drove him south and the warmth followed to let him\r\nmove back again. Usually he took the same trail from river to river,\r\nbut this time--as in a few other restless years--something had driven\r\nhim to seek a new way, risking the long runs through the foodless\r\nwastelands, from river to river, looking for some end he never found.\r\n\r\nHe pawed out a stubborn bone from between his teeth and got to his feet\r\nagain, the double drive overcoming the wish to rest in the warmth of\r\nthe sun. Beyond the shelter of the dunes along the river, the wind was\r\nsharper and colder, tossing bits of dry sticks and rubble ahead of it.\r\n\r\nHe had no idea of why he was heading inland, except that it seemed\r\nsomehow right, until the damp odors on the wind told him that the river\r\nmust bend in the direction he was heading. By then, he was out of sight\r\nof the water and the plants, birds and insects that lived along it. He\r\nsettled into a steady lope as he came to what had once been a raised\r\nroadway. The banked surface was comparatively free of sand, making the\r\ngoing easier.\r\n\r\nThe road swept past what must have once been heavily-wooded land, and\r\nKing sniffed the familiar odor of rotted logs. A few trees were still\r\nstanding, dead and girdled to a height above his head, but there was no\r\nlife there.\r\n\r\nThe sand and dust drifted into piles and shifted before the wind,\r\ncovering and uncovering the ever-present broken rabbit bones, scouring\r\nat them and the standing trunks, as if to eliminate even this final\r\nevidence that there had been life. In some sections, a few trees and\r\nplants had survived and were spreading, but the great dust-bowl area\r\nhere was barren. Except for the wind and the padding of King’s feet,\r\nthere was no sound.\r\n\r\nOnce the road ran among the wrecks of close-packed houses, and King’s\r\nhackles lifted again, his nose twitching uneasily. It had been twenty\r\nyears since he had bothered to investigate a house, but this morning\r\nhis mind kept prickling with strange sensations.\r\n\r\nHe hesitated at a couple of the rust-crumpled cars; the larger one held\r\ncrumpled bones that almost meant something to him. Then he left the\r\ndead town behind, heading for the strengthening smell of the river.\r\n\r\nTen minutes later, he was staring out at a long concrete bridge that\r\nspanned the current. Beyond it lay the city.\r\n\r\nThe wind was colder now, driving along before a dull gray that\r\nthreatened a storm. Below King, the water stretched out, heading toward\r\nthe south and safety for the winter. He moved uncertainly away from the\r\nbridge, then dropped to his haunches, his tongue rolling out doubtfully\r\nas he stared at the bridge and the city beyond.\r\n\r\nSomething was wrong in his head. He scratched at his ear, turned to\r\nbite at the root of his tail, and still hesitated.\r\n\r\nFinally he got to his feet and headed along the pitted surface of the\r\nbridge. A sign creaked, jerking his ears forward. It was only half\r\na sign, without a place name, but carrying an iron engraving of its\r\npopulation, now smeared over with weathered paint.\r\n\r\nKing bristled toward it, smelled it cautiously, and was abruptly nosing\r\nbehind it frantically. There was only the whisper of the ghost of an\r\nodor there, and it was too faint to stimulate his senses more than\r\nonce. He clawed at it, whining, but the scent from his dreams refused\r\nto return.\r\n\r\nHe began running again, leaping over gaps in the paving. One\r\nnewly-fallen section was impassable, and he had to search his way\r\nacross twelve-inch, rusty iron beams. He slipped twice, and had to\r\nscratch and fight his way back.\r\n\r\nAt mid-point, with the limits of the small city spread out before him,\r\nhe stopped to explode in a barking sound he hadn’t made in thirty\r\nyears. Then he was plunging on again, until the bridge was behind and\r\nhe was coursing through the wide, ruined streets at a full run.\r\n\r\nTwice he started on false trails through the shops and warehouses, but\r\nthe third time something seemed to groove itself into his thoughts,\r\nlike the feeling that led him back to the salmon run each year. It was\r\nweak and uncertain, as old memories fought against stronger habits, but\r\nit grew as he panted his way out of the heart of the ruined city. Glass\r\nfractured and clattered downward from one building, followed by a skull\r\nthat shattered on the stones.\r\n\r\nKing avoided the shower of fragments and redoubled his speed, his big\r\nbody bent in arching leaps, and his ears flattened back against his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nHe knew where he was, even before he swept through the last of the\r\nrooming house section and came to the edge of the rolling university\r\ncampus. Then, for a moment, the dawning memory in his mind spun and\r\ntwisted at the ruin the elements had made. But it was the lack of\r\nfamiliar smells that bothered him most. Even at the end, there had been\r\nthe eternal odor of the chemistry laboratory, and now even that was\r\ngone.\r\n\r\nThe big gate was open. His legs had begun to bunch for the leap and\r\nscramble over it, and the tension in them died slowly. He slowed to\r\na trot, lifting his head in a double bark that rasped the unfamiliar\r\nmuscles of his throat. A huge tree had fallen across the path, but a\r\nsection had been cut away with an axe. Rotted chips sounded underfoot\r\nas King passed by.\r\n\r\nThen he was darting around one of the big redstone buildings, heading\r\ndown the path that led to the back of the campus. There most of the\r\ngreat tree boles still stood, with even their nakedness too thick a\r\nscreen for his eyes to penetrate. He charged through the rubble of\r\nsticks and rabbit bones that filled the path there and took a sudden\r\nleft turn, to come to a skidding halt.\r\n\r\nThe two-story Promethean Laboratory building still stood, and across\r\nthe fence beyond some of the familiar houses were still there. King\r\nteetered toward one of them, back toward the laboratory, and then again\r\ntoward the house. He let out two high-pitched barks, and cocked his\r\nears, listening. There was no answering sound.\r\n\r\nA sick whine grew in his throat, until the wind suddenly shifted.\r\n\r\nThe smell was stronger this time. It was wrong--incredibly wrong--but\r\nit was beyond mistake. Doc was here! And with the instinctive\r\nidentification of wind direction, he knew it had to be the laboratory.\r\n\r\nThe door was closed, but it snapped open with a groan of hinges as King\r\nhit it in full leap. He went rolling over and over across the floor of\r\nthe littered hall, clawing against the stone tiles instinctively, while\r\nhis mind rocked at the waves of human scent and the human voice that\r\nwas beating into his ears!\r\n\r\nThe smell was so strong to his unaccustomed nostrils that he had no\r\ndirectional sense; at first the echoes along the hollow corridors made\r\nit hard to locate the voice, also. He cocked his ears, studying it. It\r\nwas wrong, like the smell--yet it was the voice of Doc!\r\n\r\n“... as wrong as before. It didn’t matter. It was better than starving\r\nlike rabbits under the biocast. They were falling within minutes after\r\nthe cable ...”\r\n\r\nKing dove through the passage and into the room beyond. The voice\r\nwent on without pause, coming from a box in front of him. And now\r\nthe metallic quality under it and the lack of the random ultrasonic\r\novertones of a real voice registered on him. It was only another\r\nfalse voice--another of the things men had, but which he had almost\r\nforgotten. Doc’s voice--without Doc!\r\n\r\nThe sound dropped to the bottom of his awareness. King swung around\r\nthe room. There was something in the scent that made his neck muscles\r\ntense, but he knew Doc was there. His eyes adjusted to the glaring\r\nlight inside, while his nose tried to cut a trail through the thickness\r\nof the odors. Both senses located the source at the same time.\r\n\r\nBeside the big machine with the slow-spinning rolls of tape there was\r\na bed covered with ragged blankets. A hand lay on the edge of the tape\r\nmachine, twisted into the controls, and an arm led down at the figure\r\nbelow on the bed.\r\n\r\nKing’s tail flailed the floor, and his legs doubled for the leap that\r\nwould carry him into Doc’s arms. But the motion was never completed.\r\nThe wrongness of the scent and the motionless figure was too great. The\r\ntail grew limp as he crouched to the floor, inching his way forward,\r\nhis whine barely audible.\r\n\r\nHe raised his nose at last to the other hand that lay dropping over the\r\nside of the bed, and his tongue came out.\r\n\r\nThe hand was cool and stiff, and there was no response to welcome\r\nKing’s caress.\r\n\r\nSlowly, cringing within himself, King drew himself up to look down at\r\nwhat lay on the bed, and to nuzzle it. It didn’t look like Doc. Doc had\r\nbeen young and alive, clean-shaven and with dark hair. The body was too\r\nthin, and the long beard and hair were stark white. Yet the odor said\r\nunquestionably that this was Doc--and that Doc was old--and dead!\r\n\r\nStanding with his front feet on the bed, King lifted his muzzle\r\nupwards, his mouth opening while the deep, long sound ached in his\r\nchest. But no sound came. He brought his face down to that of Doc and\r\nnuzzled again, whimpering. It did no good.\r\n\r\nFor a long time he lay there, whining and crying. The voice went on and\r\nsomething ticked regularly on the wall. There was the sound of the wind\r\noutside, faint here, but rising steadily. Once King heard his own name\r\nused by Doc’s voice from the box, and his ears half lifted.\r\n\r\n“... King and the other three. Probably starved by now, though, since\r\nthere are no land animals left for them to feed on. King was a smart\r\ndog, but ...”\r\n\r\nHis name wasn’t repeated, though he listened for a while. Later,\r\nthe voice stopped entirely, while the tape hummed a few more times,\r\nclicked, and began flapping a loosened end that knocked over a bottle\r\nof pills beside Doc’s frozen hand. It clicked again, and slowed to\r\nsilence, leaving the ticking of the clock the only sound in the room.\r\n\r\nAbruptly, there was a rustling noise. King shot to his feet, whirling\r\nto face the source, just as a large white rat scuttled from the shadows\r\nnear the door. It went rigid at his movement, coming slowly to its hind\r\nfeet, its eyes darting from King to the body of Doc. It let out a high\r\nsqueak.\r\n\r\nThe dog dived for it, snarling. But a threat of familiarity was\r\nclutching at his mind, slowing his charge. The rat twisted around and\r\nthrough the door, quavering out a series of squeaks. It went scuttling\r\nalong the hall, through the opened door, and across the steps to the\r\nwasteland beyond. By the time King reached the outside, it was heading\r\nfor the great tower across the street and half-way to the rocket field.\r\n\r\nKing could smell its spoor mixed thickly with that of Doc as he leaped\r\nthe fence and followed. He heard it squeal once more as it saw him,\r\nand heard its claws scrape against the rotted metal of the tower as it\r\nscurried up beyond his reach.\r\n\r\nBut he was slowing already. The tower was dead now, with the great ball\r\nof fire gone from its top, but the memory of the tingling, itching\r\nfalse smell that had plagued him while the fire glowed was rising in\r\nhis mind to drive him back. He hated it as Doc had hated it--and there\r\nwas still fear for what it had been. He stopped fifty feet beyond the\r\nmassive girders, bristling as he backed around it.\r\n\r\nThe concrete hut under it was broken now, though, and the guards were\r\ngone. He saw some of the guns scattered about--or what was left of\r\nthem--in the jumble of sand and human skeletons that still lay around\r\nthe tower.\r\n\r\nSome of the skeletons were further back, mixed with axes and other\r\nguns. An arm was still tangled with a shred of rope that connected to\r\na faded metal sign. Where the great cable had been, a blackened line\r\ncurved toward the tower, pitting the metal more deeply.\r\n\r\nSomehow, King knew the tower of the tingling fire was dead. But he had\r\nwaited too long. The rat had scrambled down and was heading toward the\r\nrocket field. He started after it again, halted, and reluctantly turned\r\nback toward the laboratory.\r\n\r\nThere was pleading in his whine as he found the body of Doc again, but\r\nit still bore the smell of death. Instinct told King that Doc was dead,\r\nand would never be anything but dead. Yet there was the half-remembered\r\nsmell of his brother Boris, after the sweet smells and the prickings,\r\nlying on the table while Doc and the men stood around.\r\n\r\nBoris had smelled dead--and Boris had walked again, smelling freshly\r\nalive. Before that, there had been the dead rats that would not stay\r\ndead. And the rabbits--though when the rabbits finally smelled dead,\r\nthey were all dead, and no more rabbits lived.\r\n\r\nHe circled Doc uneasily, his lips lifted. He paced to the outer door,\r\nsearching for any return of the rat, while his mind slowly remembered\r\nthe other rats. With a quick check on Doc, King darted up the stairs,\r\nhis legs making a familiar pattern of it, and into the great laboratory\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nThere were no more rats. The cages were empty, and the scents he had\r\nlearned here as a puppy were almost gone. Only the room itself was the\r\nsame as the one that had haunted his hunger-driven dreams.\r\n\r\nThere had been the rats on the table when he was young and the tower\r\nwas only a banging beyond the window. The rats that died, and the three\r\nthat did not, when the men drank smelly liquid and shouted and danced\r\nall night, shaking their fists at the base of the tower. The table was\r\nstill there, beyond the place where the men mixed the strange smells.\r\nThe table where strange things happened to him later that he could not\r\nremember.\r\n\r\nThe tail he had owned before the last time on the table still hung\r\nthere. There had been another wild night when the bandages came off his\r\nnew tail, puppy-small and weak, but growing quickly enough. This room\r\nhad been a good place, and some of his later dreams had been good.\r\n\r\nOther dreams had remembered the bad times, as they came back to his\r\nmind now. The night the tower blazed with fire, Doc swearing while King\r\nfelt the tingling until it was cut off. The men arguing with Doc, not\r\ncoming back--even moving toward the hated tower. The huge celebration\r\noutside when the tower blazed again, while Doc and his one friend\r\ncried. The wild frenzy of stringing wires over the Promethean lab and\r\ninto a vile-smelling box. After that, there was no more tingling in his\r\nnostrils inside the lab, but things had grown worse in spite of it.\r\n\r\nKing was trembling as he finished his inspection for rats, and his legs\r\nbeat a frantic tattoo down the stairs. The fear was as thick as it had\r\nbeen when the men came and took him and his brothers away from Doc, to\r\njam them into planes with other dogs and dump them far away, where the\r\nrabbits were thick--and almost useless for food.\r\n\r\nDoc had fought then, even moving outside the safety of the laboratory,\r\nbut the men had taken the dogs. Yet Doc had been alive. And now he was\r\ndead.\r\n\r\nThe fear twisted in King, settling into something sick. He paced around\r\nthe body, growling and whining. Once he stopped to lick the hand. It\r\nwas colder now, and there was no moisture on it. The scent was growing\r\nmore wrong as the body cooled.\r\n\r\nLife had not come back while he was gone.\r\n\r\nHe licked Doc’s hand again, and an answering chill went through the\r\ndog. The feeling of death began to settle deeper--a feeling inside that\r\ngrew and swallowed him, a hungry feeling. He shook it away, as he would\r\nhave shaken the neck of the rat, but it came back stronger than before.\r\n\r\nThere was real hunger mixed with it. Eating was never good on the trip\r\nsouth, and he had burned too much energy chasing about that morning.\r\nThe fish had not been enough. The smell of stale food of some kind in\r\nthe room tantalized him, though he could find none, and reminded him\r\nthat there had been traces of the same odors along the path the rat had\r\ntaken. The saliva was rising in his mouth at the thought. It drew him\r\nout, while the death inside pressed him away.\r\n\r\nHe started off twice, to return each time for another inspection. He\r\nwhimpered and tried tugging at the sleeve of the arm. The rags parted,\r\nbut Doc gave no sign. The death smell was stronger. King paced about,\r\nfighting the hunger and misery until they were too much. There was the\r\nfood smell, the rat--and when he came back to Doc....\r\n\r\nA faint mist was being driven along by the wind as he reached the tower\r\nagain, braving it this time without stopping. Until the rain washed it\r\naway, the spoor would be all the stronger for the moisture in the air,\r\nand he followed it easily, until it ended on the blasted area of the\r\nrocket field.\r\n\r\nKing stopped at the sight of the bent and worn take-off cradles. From\r\nthe distance, the first faint roll of thunder came, and he bolted\r\nstiff-legged, snarling with fear, as if one of the monster ships he had\r\nseen the men building so frantically were blasting up again.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe excitement of the frenzied construction had drawn him to it,\r\neven when it meant sneaking away from Doc--until he had been present\r\nafter the infants were all aboard, and the rocket took off. The\r\nthunder-booming roar, the gout of eye-searing flame and the smell that\r\nparalyzed his nose for hours had sent him cringing back to shiver at\r\nDoc’s feet, and each new take-off had brought a fresh attack. He still\r\nwanted nothing to do with the rockets.\r\n\r\nThe cradles were empty now, however--except for something that looked\r\nlike one that had crashed down and was lying on its sides, the big\r\ntubes ripped away, and the ground scorched around it. And as he looked,\r\nthe distant form of the rat appeared from below it and leaped upwards\r\nthrough a door there.\r\n\r\nKing edged toward it, following the trail that led there, uncertain. It\r\nlooked dead, but the other that had roared away on its lightning and\r\nthunder had also seemed dead. Then lightning and thunder boomed behind\r\nhim, and he forced himself to a faster trot.\r\n\r\nThe hulk seemed harmless. There were none of the chemical smells now,\r\nand the fumes of the ancient blast that had fizzled were gone. He moved\r\ngingerly toward the door, his nose twitching at the odors that came\r\nfrom it, just as the rat appeared.\r\n\r\nIt saw him and squeaked sharply, dashing back inside. King abandoned\r\nhis caution. With a low growl, he leaped through the doorway above the\r\nground. The edge of the metal tore at him, thin projections sticking\r\nout where it had been crudely hacked away. He snapped at it, then\r\nturned to find the rat.\r\n\r\nThere was enough light inside to see dimly. The rat had retreated into\r\na narrow pipe that ran back. King tried to poke his nose into it, then\r\nfished with his paw. The rat drew back and snapped at him. Its teeth\r\nmissed, but it was enough to teach him caution.\r\n\r\nHe drew back, crunching across a litter of dried papers, foil and\r\njunk he could not recognize. A thicker bundle twisted under his feet,\r\nand the thick, heavy smell of meat--red meat, not the weak flesh of\r\nfish--filled his nostrils. Without thinking, he snapped down.\r\n\r\nThe stuff was dry and hard, disappointing at first. But as he chewed,\r\nover the salt and the odd flavorings, the almost forgotten flavor came\r\nthrough, sending saliva dripping from his mouth. From the odors here,\r\nhe knew the rat had been eating it before he came, but it didn’t matter.\r\n\r\nHe finished the package, spitting out the wax, metal, paper and\r\nplastics that surrounded it as best he could. Then his nose led\r\nhim along the trail of the rat’s gnawing, back to the few tons of\r\nconcentrate that were left.\r\n\r\nThere was no smell to guide him from the outside of the packages, but\r\nhe had learned to find food where it could be discovered. He tore into\r\na package, gasping as a thick, fruity stuff seared at his tongue. He\r\ntried again, further away. It was food, this time. He ripped away the\r\ncovering first, and settled down with the brick between his paws,\r\nworking on it until it was gone.\r\n\r\nOutside, the rain had increased to a torrent. He studied the rat and\r\nthe view outside, and finally curled up against the door, blocking the\r\nrat’s egress. Some rain came through, making a small puddle on the\r\nfloor and wetting his coat, but he disregarded it at first, until the\r\nthirst began to grow in him. He lapped at the puddle, finding some\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\nHis stomach began to feel wrong then. It was heavy, full, and\r\nmiserable. He fought against it, lapping more water. The rat came out\r\nof its hole and found another brick of food. He heard it gnawing, but\r\nthe effort of moving was too great.\r\n\r\nWhen the sickness finally won, he felt better. But it was an hour\r\nlater, while the storm raged and the lightning split the sky with waves\r\nof solid fear, before he could pull himself back to another brick. This\r\ntime he ate more carefully, stopping to drink between parts of his\r\nmeal. It worked better. The food stuck with him, and his hunger was\r\nfinally satisfied.\r\n\r\nHe lay near the doorway of the old rocket, staring out through the\r\ndarkness that was still split by lightning. The rat scurried about\r\nbehind him, but he let it go. Now that it was harmless and his stomach\r\nwas filled, some of the old pattern began to stir in his mind. It was\r\none of the rats he had known so long ago, its smell grown old, but\r\nstill clearly identifiable.\r\n\r\nHe had tried twice to leave the ship and force his way back to where\r\nDoc was lying, but the lightning drove him back. Now he lifted his\r\nvoice in a long, mournful bark. There was no answering call from Doc.\r\nHe began working himself up for another try.\r\n\r\nLightning crashed down in the direction of the laboratory. The building\r\nitself stood out in the glare, with every wire of its outer covering\r\nglowing white hot.\r\n\r\nThere was a roll of sharp, near thunder, and then another explosion\r\nthat seemed to open the laboratory up in a blossom of flame through the\r\nabating rain. King muttered unhappily, licking his lips uneasily, while\r\nhis tail curved tighter against him. But now, while the flame still\r\nsmoldered around the distant building and the lightning might come\r\nback, now was no time to risk it.\r\n\r\nHe turned around several times, scraping away the litter, buried his\r\nnose in the tuft of his tail, and tried to relax. He was almost asleep\r\nwhen he felt the rat creep up to him. It must have recognized his\r\nsmell, too, since it settled down against him as it had done when they\r\nwere both together in the laboratory with Doc. He snarled faintly, then\r\nlet it alone, and went to sleep. Surprisingly, there were no dreams to\r\nbother him.\r\n\r\nThe rat was gone in the morning when King awoke, and the sun was\r\nshining, though the quieter wind held a coldness that was too close\r\nto freezing to suit him. He hesitated, turning back toward the food\r\nstores. Then the sight of the rat, racing across the space near the\r\ntower, decided him. With an unhappy growl, he dropped from the hulk of\r\nthe rocket and took off after it.\r\n\r\nIf the rat got there before he did, and Doc needed him....\r\n\r\nIn open running, the rat was no match for him. It drew aside, its high\r\nvoice chattering, as he thundered up. He did not turn, but drove on,\r\nheading at a full run for the laboratory.\r\n\r\nThere was no laboratory! The steps were there, blackened and cracked.\r\nSome of the walls still stood. But the building he had known was gone.\r\nBeside it, the trunk of one of the big trees had been blasted apart,\r\nand now had its tattered remnants strewn over the dirt, mingling with\r\nthe coals from the fire that had gutted the building.\r\n\r\nA few were still smoking, though the rain had put out the blaze before\r\nit had completely burned out by itself. The heavy, acrid scent of damp,\r\nburned wood loaded the air, concealing everything else from his scent.\r\n\r\nHe uttered a short, anguished yelp and went dashing through the\r\ndoorway. The ashes were hot, and the stones left from the floor were\r\nhotter, but he could stand them. He hardly felt them as he swung toward\r\nwhat had once been the room where Doc lay.\r\n\r\nThe box from which the voice had come was gone, but the twisted wreck\r\nof the tape machine was there. And beside it, charred scraps showed\r\nwhat had once been a bed.\r\n\r\nKing cried out as his nose touched the heat, but he was pawing\r\nfrantically, disregarding the pain. He could stand it--and he had to.\r\nHe shoveled the refuse aside, digging for something that was his. And\r\nfinally, under the charred raggedness, there were traces. There was\r\neven enough to know that it had once been Doc.\r\n\r\nAnd Doc was still dead--as dead as the meat that once came from can had\r\nbeen dead.\r\n\r\nKing whimpered over the remains, while the rat climbed onto a section\r\nof the wall and chattered uneasily. But the dog was already backing\r\naway. He stopped beyond the hot ruins of the building to lift his head.\r\nFor a second, he held the pose while the rat watched him, before his\r\nhead came down and he turned slowly away.\r\n\r\nThe food in the rocket lay to his right, and the old gate through which\r\nhe had first come was on his left. He licked his lips as his eyes\r\nturned to the rocket, but his legs moved unwaveringly left.\r\n\r\nThe steady walk turned into a trot, and his stride lengthened, carrying\r\nhim back to the rooming-house section, and on into the former business\r\nsection. There had been other fires, and one had spread across several\r\nblocks. He swung around it and back to the street he had first taken.\r\n\r\nAhead of him, the bridge came into view, and nearer was the bank of the\r\nriver on this side.\r\n\r\nKing did not waver from his course. His legs paced out onto the rotten\r\npavement that would carry him across the stream. He moved on, slowing\r\nas he had to walk the girders again. When he was past that section, and\r\nat the mid-point of the bridge, something seemed to turn him.\r\n\r\nThe town lay behind him from here, most of it visible at the crest of\r\nthe bridge. The rain and the storm had made changes, but they were too\r\nsmall to notice. And the university lay at the edge of King’s vision,\r\nthough some of the tower could be seen. He faced toward it, and then\r\nunerringly toward the place where the laboratory should have been.\r\n\r\nNow his muzzle lifted into the air as he sank to his haunches. He\r\nseemed to brace himself, and his lungs expanded slowly. He could\r\nfeel it, and the need of it. The instinct behind it was too old for\r\nremembrance, but the ritual came finally by itself, with no conscious\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\nHis mouth opened, and the dirge keened on the air, lifting and driving\r\nupwards toward the empty sky above. There was only the single requiem.\r\nThen King swung back toward the distant shore, picking his way along\r\nthe worn bridge.\r\n\r\nHe slipped down the crumbled bank to the thin edge of sand near the\r\nstream and turned southward, trotting on steadily with the cold wind at\r\nhis back.\r\n\r\nSomewhere, there would be a place to fish for his breakfast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber’s note:\r\n\r\n\r\nThis etext was produced from Fantastic Universe, January 1956 (Vol. 4,\r\nNo. 6).
