JOHN'S COLLEGE, OXFORD.\r\n\r\n  LONDON: GEORGE BELL & SONS, YORK STREET,\r\n  COVENT GARDEN.\r\n  1887.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  LONDON:\r\n  PRINTED BY WILLIAM CLOWES AND SONS, LIMITED,\r\n  STAMFORD STREET AND CHARING CROSS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following Translation of Aristotle's History of Animals has been\r\nmade from the text of Schneider. In a work of considerable difficulty\r\nit is hardly possible entirely to avoid errors; but it is hoped that\r\nthose which have escaped are neither numerous nor important. The\r\nnotes of Schneider have been consulted throughout; and in places of\r\ndifficulty the English translation by Taylor, the French of Camus, and\r\nthe German of Strack, have been severally referred to.\r\n\r\nThe work itself is the most ancient and celebrated contribution to\r\nscience which has come down to us; and it is hardly possible, when we\r\nconsider the means of observation which were accessible at the time,\r\nto imagine a work of more accurate observation. From the numerous\r\nquotations in which our author avails himself of the experience of his\r\npredecessors in the same field, as well as corrects their errors, there\r\ncan be no doubt that Aristotle had the advantage of many works which\r\nhave perished in the lapse of ages. In the Appendix to the present\r\nTranslation will be found the Essay of Schneider on the sources whence\r\nAristotle derived his knowledge of the animals he describes; and these\r\nsources, together with his own accurate observations, are probably\r\nsufficient to account for the correct knowledge of the history of\r\nanimals displayed throughout the work.\r\n\r\nIt is right, perhaps, to observe in this place, that Dr. Smith, in\r\nhis Dictionary of Biography, speaks of the 'History of Animals' as\r\npartly the result of the royal liberality of Alexander; and doubtless\r\nAristotle would gladly have introduced into his work any fresh\r\nmaterials which might have been made available to him either during\r\nhis residence at the Macedonian court, or by the subsequent victories\r\nof Alexander in the East, if the information so obtained had reached\r\nAthens in sufficient time to be incorporated. But in the first instance\r\nhe would naturally use the materials ready to his hand in the works of\r\nhis predecessors, and these were not few. The animals also which he\r\ndescribes are principally those of Greece and of the countries with\r\nwhich the enterprising Greeks had frequent and commercial intercourse.\r\nHe says little of the animals of the interior of Asia and of India,\r\nand speaks very cautiously of such as he does mention; and one who\r\nquotes his authorities so freely would hardly have failed to notice the\r\nsources of his information.\r\n\r\nThe study, or at least the knowledge of the classification of animals\r\nappears to have been carefully pursued in the earliest period of man's\r\nhistory. The oldest records that we possess contain abundant notices\r\nof the peculiarities of animals. The Mosaic law abounds in them, in\r\nits distinctions between the clean and the unclean, a distinction\r\nnot then first established, but of the most remote antiquity. Indeed\r\nit could hardly be otherwise than that men engaged in the pursuits\r\nof agriculture and the chase should study the habits of the animals\r\nthat were valuable to them, as well as those which were injurious. A\r\nstudy thus commenced by necessity, would eventually be pursued for\r\nits own sake; and not a few would be found who would investigate, and,\r\nas far as they could, record the various phenomena they observed. The\r\npaintings of Egypt and the sculptures of Assyria are our witnesses of\r\nthe skill with which animals and plants were drawn, and of the minute\r\nperception of their external forms; and the knowledge thus gained in\r\nthe ancient centres of civilization would be sure to circulate and\r\nincrease when the intercourse with foreign nations spread the knowledge\r\nand philosophy so acquired.\r\n\r\nIn the writings of Homer we find that the knowledge of the anatomy\r\nof the human body had already made considerable progress; and the\r\ninspection of the animals offered in sacrifice cannot fail to have\r\nadded much to the general knowledge of their history. A century\r\nlater, we have the poems of Hesiod, devoted to the encouragement of\r\nagriculture and rural pursuits. Pythagoras, in the seventh century\r\nB.C., may perhaps have left no writings, but we know that he was an\r\neminent student and exponent of natural phenomena. His contemporary,\r\nAlcmæon of Crotona, is especially mentioned by Aristotle; and he is\r\neminent among natural philosophers as the first who is said to have\r\nrecommended to his followers the practice of dissection. Empedocles\r\nof Agrigentum left a work on the phenomena of nature, of which a few\r\nfragments still remain, and there were also others who, if they did not\r\nenter into the details of what we now call natural history, treated\r\ngenerally of the nature of things, and opened the field to those who\r\nwould study the subject in its particular parts. The empire of Persia\r\nwas still the dominant power, and was carrying the civilization of the\r\nEast to every part of the known world when Ctesias wrote his great\r\nworks, of which, unhappily, only a few fragments remain. He described\r\nnot only the history of his own time, but also the natural history\r\nof Persia and of India, and that probably with more accuracy than has\r\nbeen usually attributed to him. India he had not visited personally,\r\nso that he could only describe it from the information of others; but\r\nthis implies that he was not alone in the studies which he devoted to\r\nnatural objects. With such predecessors and aided by his own acute\r\nobservations, we need not wonder that Aristotle produced a work which\r\nhas ever been admired by naturalists, and must continue to rise in\r\ntheir estimation the longer it is in their hands.\r\n\r\nThe Index to the present volume has been formed on the basis of that\r\nof Schneider, and considerable pains have been taken to add as many\r\nnames as possible from other sources, especially the Index of Strack,\r\nand Külb's recent translation of the History of Animals, both of which\r\ncontain identifications of a great many animals. A few identifications\r\nhave also been added from Liddell and Scott's Lexicon, as well as from\r\nProfessor Bell's Catalogue of Animals in Captain Spratt's work on\r\nLycia; and the cephalopods are named from Professor Owen's article on\r\nthat class, in the Cyclopædia of Anatomy. It is hoped, therefore, that\r\nthe Index will be found to contain a greater number of suggestions for\r\nthe identification of the animals mentioned by Aristotle than have been\r\nhitherto published collectively. It is also right to add, that it has\r\nbeen compiled after the translation was completed; and, therefore, in\r\nany differences which may be found between the identifications at the\r\nfoot of the page and those given in the Index, the reader will rather\r\nprefer the latter, as the result of later research in works which were\r\nnot accessible when the translation was made.\r\n\r\nApril 30, 1862.                                   R. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANALYTICAL TABLE OF CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK I.--The work commences with a general review of the animal\r\nkingdom, and several suggestions for a natural arrangement of animals\r\nin groups, according to their external form or their mode of life, a\r\ncomparison of animals among themselves, and a description of some of\r\ntheir habits. Aristotle then introduces the human form, the best known\r\nto man, as the standard of comparison to which he refers the rest of\r\nthe animal kingdom. The concluding chapters of this book are occupied\r\nwith a description of the several parts of the human body, both\r\ninternal and external.\r\n\r\nBOOK II.--In the second book the different parts of animals are\r\ndescribed. The animals are arranged in various groups, viviparous and\r\noviparous quadrupeds, fish, serpents, birds. The only animals described\r\nare those with red blood: the description of the rest being reserved\r\nfor the fourth book. Their internal organs are also described; and\r\nin the course of the book a few animals, as the ape, elephant, and\r\nchameleon, are especially noticed.\r\n\r\nBOOK III.--The third book commences with a description of the internal\r\norgans, beginning with the generative system. A considerable portion\r\nof the book is devoted to the course of the veins; and Aristotle\r\nquotes from other writers, as well as states the result of his own\r\nobservations. He then describes the nature of other constituent parts\r\nof the body, sinews, fibres, bone, marrow, cartilage, nails, hoofs,\r\nclaws, horns, and beaks of birds, hair, scales, membranes, flesh, fat,\r\nblood, marrow, milk, and the spermatic fluid.\r\n\r\nBOOK IV.--Animals without blood, and first, the cephalopods, are\r\ndescribed; then the crustaceans, testacea, echinidæ, ascidians,\r\nactiniæ, hermit crabs, insects. In the eighth chapter the organs of\r\nsense are considered, and afterwards, the voice, sleep, age, and\r\ndifferences of the sexes in animals are described.\r\n\r\nBOOK V.--In the former books animals are for the most part described\r\nwith reference to their several parts. In the fifth book they\r\nare treated as entire, and especially with regard to their mode\r\nof reproduction. First of all, our author treats of spontaneous\r\nreproduction, and then of those animals which spring from a union of\r\nthe sexes; and from this he proceeds to some detail with respect to\r\ndifferent groups of animals, testacea, crustacea, insects. The book\r\nconcludes with a long description of bees and their habits.\r\n\r\nBOOK VI.--In this book the same subject is continued through the\r\nseveral classes of birds, fish, and quadrupeds. This account of the\r\nreproduction of animals includes also the consideration of the seasons,\r\nclimates, and ages of animals, and how far these influence their\r\nreproduction.\r\n\r\nBOOK VII.--The seventh book is almost entirely devoted to the\r\nconsideration of the reproduction of man, and an account of man from\r\nhis birth to his death. This book ends abruptly, and is probably\r\nimperfect.\r\n\r\nBOOK VIII.--In the eighth book Aristotle passes on to the most\r\ninteresting part of his work, the character and habits of the whole\r\nanimal world, as it was known to him. The amount of detail which he has\r\ncollected and arranged on this subject is most interesting. He treats,\r\nfirst of all, of the food of animals, of their migrations, their health\r\nand diseases, and the influence of climate upon them.\r\n\r\nBOOK IX.--The subject of the eighth book is continued, with an account\r\nof the relations in which animals stand to each other, and especially\r\nthe friendship and hostility of different species; and these are for\r\nthe most part referred to the nature of their food, and their mode\r\nof procuring it. The notices of fish are not so numerous as those of\r\nother groups: this would necessarily arise from the difficulty of\r\nobservation. At the conclusion of the book, an essay on bees and their\r\ncongeners is given at considerable length.\r\n\r\nBOOK X.--This book, in all probability erroneously ascribed to\r\nAristotle, is occupied with a treatise on the causes of barrenness\r\nin the human species. It appears to be rather a continuation of the\r\nseventh book, which ends abruptly; but it is well placed at the end, as\r\nno genuine work of our author.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HISTORY OF ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THE FIRST.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n1. Some parts of animals are simple, and these can be divided into like\r\nparts, as flesh into pieces of flesh; others are compound, and cannot\r\nbe divided into like parts, as the hand cannot be divided into hands,\r\nnor the face into faces. Of these some are not only called parts, but\r\nmembers, such as those which, though entire in themselves, are made up\r\nof other parts, as the head and the leg, the hand and the entire arm,\r\nor the trunk; for these parts are both entire in themselves, and made\r\nup of other parts.\r\n\r\n2. All the compound parts also are made up of simple parts, the hand,\r\nfor example, of flesh, and sinew, and bone. Some animals have all these\r\nparts the same, in others they are different from each other. Some of\r\nthe parts are the same in form, as the nose and eye of one man is the\r\nsame as the nose and eye of another man, and flesh is the same with\r\nflesh, and bone with bone. In like manner we may compare the parts of\r\nthe horse, and of other animals, those parts, that is, which are the\r\nsame in species, for the whole bears the same relation to the whole as\r\nthe parts do to each other. And in animals belonging to the same class,\r\nthe parts are the same, only they differ in excess or defect. By class,\r\nI mean such as bird or fish, for all these differ if either compared\r\nwith their own class or with another, and there are many forms of birds\r\nand fishes.\r\n\r\n3. Nearly all their parts differ in them according to the opposition\r\nof their external qualities, such as colour or shape, in that some are\r\nmore, others are less affected, or sometimes in number more or less,\r\nor in size greater and smaller, or in any quality which can be included\r\nin excess or defect. For some animals have a soft skin, in others the\r\nskin is shelly; some have a long bill, as cranes, others a short one;\r\nsome have many feathers, others very few; some also have parts which\r\nare wanting in others, for some species have spurs, others have none;\r\nsome have a crest, others have not. But, so to say, their principal\r\nparts and those which form the bulk of their body, are either the same,\r\nor vary only in their opposites, and in excess and defect.\r\n\r\n4. By excess and defect I mean the greater and the less. But some\r\nanimals agree with each other in their parts neither in form, nor in\r\nexcess and defect, but have only an analogous likeness, such as a bone\r\nbears to a spine, a nail to a hoof, a hand to a crab's claw, the scale\r\nof a fish to the feather of a bird, for that which is a feather in\r\nthe birds is a scale in the fish. With regard then to the parts which\r\neach class of animal possesses, they agree and differ in this manner,\r\nand also in the position of the parts. For many animals have the same\r\nparts, but not in the same position, as the mammæ which are either\r\npectoral or abdominal. But of the simple parts some are soft and moist,\r\nothers hard and dry.\r\n\r\n5. The soft parts are either entirely so, or so long as they are in a\r\nnatural condition, as blood, serum, fat, tallow, marrow, semen, gall,\r\nmilk (in those animals which give milk), flesh, and other analogous\r\nparts of the body. In another manner also the excretions of the body\r\nbelong to this class, as phlegm, and the excrements of the abdomen and\r\nbladder; the hard and dry parts are sinew, skin, vein, hair, bone,\r\ncartilage, nail, horn, for that part bears the same name, and on\r\nthe whole is called horn, and the other parts of the body which are\r\nanalogous to these.\r\n\r\n6. Animals also differ in their manner of life, in their actions and\r\ndispositions, and in their parts. We will first of all speak generally\r\nof these differences, and afterwards consider each species separately.\r\nThe following are the points in which they vary in manner of life, in\r\ntheir actions and dispositions. Some animals are aquatic, others live\r\non the land; and the aquatic may again be divided into two classes, for\r\nsome entirely exist and procure their food in the water, and take in\r\nand give out water, and cannot live without it; this is the nature of\r\nmost fishes. But there are others which, though they live and feed in\r\nthe water, do not take in water but air, and produce their young out of\r\nthe water. Many of these animals are furnished with feet, as the otter\r\nand the latax[1] and the crocodile, or with wings, as the seagull and\r\ndiver, and others are without feet, as the water-serpent. Some procure\r\ntheir food from the water, and cannot live out of the water, but\r\nneither inhale air nor water, as the acalephe[2] and the oyster.\r\n\r\n[1] Beaver, Castor fiber.\r\n\r\n[2] Medusa, or perhaps Actinia, or both.\r\n\r\n7. Different aquatic animals are found in the sea, in rivers, in lakes,\r\nand in marshes, as the frog and newt, and of marine animals some are\r\npelagic, some littoral, and some saxatile. Some land animals take in\r\nand give out air, and this is called inhaling and exhaling; such are\r\nman, and all other land animals which are furnished with lungs; some,\r\nhowever, which procure their food from the earth, do not inhale air, as\r\nthe wasp, the bee, and all other insects.[3] By insects I mean those\r\nanimals which have divisions in their bodies, whether in the lower part\r\nonly, or both in the upper and lower. Many land animals, as I have\r\nalready observed, procure their food from the water, but there are no\r\naquatic or marine animals which find their food on land. There are some\r\nanimals which at first inhabit the water, but afterwards change into a\r\ndifferent form, and live out of the water; this happens to the gnat in\r\nthe rivers, and ...[4] which afterwards becomes an œstrum.[5]\r\n\r\n[3] Under the class ἔντομα are probably included all annulose animals.\r\n\r\n[4] Some words appear to be lost in this place.\r\n\r\n[5] Tabanus, gad-fly.\r\n\r\n8. Again, there are some creatures which are stationary, while others\r\nare locomotive; the fixed animals are aquatic, but this is not the\r\ncase with any of the inhabitants of the land. Many aquatic animals\r\nalso grow upon each other; this is the case with several genera of\r\nshell-fish: the sponge also exhibits some signs of sensation, for they\r\nsay that it is drawn up with some difficulty, unless the attempt to\r\nremove it is made stealthily. Other animals also there are which are\r\nalternately fixed together or free, this is the case with a certain\r\nkind of acalephe; some of these become separated during the night, and\r\nemigrate. Many animals are separate from each other, but incapable of\r\nvoluntary movement, as oysters, and the animal called holothuria.[6]\r\nSome aquatic animals are swimmers, as fish, and the mollusca,[7] and\r\nthe malacostraca, as the crabs. Others creep on the bottom, as the\r\ncrab, for this, though an aquatic animal, naturally creeps.\r\n\r\n[6] Perhaps some species of Zoophyte.\r\n\r\n[7] Cephalopods.\r\n\r\n9. Of land animals some are furnished with wings, as birds and bees,\r\nand these differ in other respects from each other; others have feet,\r\nand of this class some species walk, others crawl, and others creep\r\nin the mud. There is no animal which has only wings as fish have only\r\nfins, for those animals whose wings are formed by an expansion of the\r\nskin can walk, and the bat has feet, the seal has imperfect feet. Among\r\nbirds there are some with very imperfect feet, which are therefore\r\ncalled apodes; they are, however, provided with very strong wings, and\r\nalmost all birds that are similar to this one have strong wings and\r\nimperfect feet, as the swallow and drepanis;[8] for all this class of\r\nbirds is alike both in habits and in the structure of their wings, and\r\ntheir whole appearance is very similar. The apos[9] is seen at all\r\ntimes of the year, but the drepanis can only be taken in rainy weather\r\nduring the summer, and on the whole is a rare bird.\r\n\r\n[8] Perhaps Sand martin.\r\n\r\n[9] Swift.\r\n\r\n10. Many animals, however, can both walk and swim. The following are\r\nthe differences exhibited by animals in their habits and their actions.\r\nSome of them are gregarious, and others solitary, both in the classes\r\nwhich are furnished with feet, and those which have wings, or fins.\r\nSome partake of both characters, and of those that are gregarious, as\r\nwell as those that are solitary, some unite in societies and some are\r\nscattered. Gregarious birds are such as the pigeon, stork, swan, but no\r\nbird with hooked claws is gregarious. Among swimming animals some fish\r\nare gregarious, as the dromas,[10] tunny, pelamis,[11] amia.[12]\r\n\r\n[10] Some migratory fish.\r\n\r\n[11] A kind of tunny, still called palamyde at Marseilles.\r\n\r\n[12] A kind of tunny, Les Bonitons (Camus.)\r\n\r\n11. But man partakes of both qualities. Those which have a common\r\nemployment are called social, but that is not the case with all\r\ngregarious animals. Man, and the bee, the wasp, and the ant, and the\r\nstork belong to this class. Some of these obey a leader, others are\r\nanarchical; the stork and the bee are of the former class, the ant and\r\nmany others belong to the latter. Some animals, both in the gregarious\r\nand solitary class, are limited to one locality, others are migratory.\r\nThere are also carnivorous animals, herbivorous, omnivorous, and\r\nothers which eat peculiar food, as the bee and the spider; the former\r\neats only honey and a few other sweet things, while spiders prey upon\r\nflies and there are other animals which feed entirely on fish. Some\r\nanimals hunt for their food, and some make a store, which others do\r\nnot. There are also animals which make habitations for themselves, and\r\nothers which do not. The mole, the mouse, the ant, and the bee, make\r\nhabitations, but many kinds both of insects and quadrupeds make no\r\ndwelling.\r\n\r\n12. With regard to situation, some are troglodite, as lizards and\r\nserpents, others, as the horse and dog, live upon the surface of the\r\nearth. Some kinds of animals burrow in the ground, others do not; some\r\nanimals are nocturnal, as the owl and the bat, others use the hours of\r\ndaylight. There are tame animals and wild animals. Man and the mule\r\nare always tame, the leopard and the wolf are invariably wild, and\r\nothers, as the elephant, are easily tamed. We may, however, view them\r\nin another way, for all the genera that have been tamed are found wild\r\nalso, as horses, oxen, swine, sheep, goats, and dogs.\r\n\r\n13. Some animals utter a loud cry, some are silent, and others have a\r\nvoice, which in some cases may be expressed by a word, in others it\r\ncannot. There are also noisy animals and silent animals, musical and\r\nunmusical kinds, but they are mostly noisy about the breeding season.\r\nSome, as the dove, frequent fields, others, as the hoopoe, live on\r\nthe mountains; some attach themselves to man, as the pigeon. Some are\r\nlascivious, as the partridge and domestic fowl, and others are chaste,\r\nas the raven, which rarely cohabits.\r\n\r\n14. Again, there are classes of animals furnished with weapons of\r\noffence, others with weapons of defence; in the former I include those\r\nwhich are capable of inflicting an injury, or of defending themselves\r\nwhen they are attacked; in the latter those which are provided with\r\nsome natural protection against injury.\r\n\r\n15. Animals also exhibit many differences of disposition. Some are\r\ngentle, peaceful, and not violent, as the ox. Some are violent,\r\npassionate, and intractable, as the wild boar. Some are prudent and\r\nfearful, as the stag and the hare. Serpents are illiberal and crafty.\r\nOthers, as the lion, are liberal, noble, and generous. Others are\r\nbrave, wild, and crafty, like the wolf. For there is this difference\r\nbetween the generous and the brave--the former means that which comes\r\nof a noble race, the latter that which does not easily depart from its\r\nown nature.\r\n\r\n16. Some animals are cunning and evil-disposed, as the fox; others, as\r\nthe dog, are fierce, friendly, and fawning. Some are gentle and easily\r\ntamed, as the elephant; some are susceptible of shame, and watchful, as\r\nthe goose. Some are jealous, and fond of ornament, as the peacock. But\r\nman is the only animal capable of reasoning, though many others possess\r\nthe faculty of memory and instruction in common with him. No other\r\nanimal but man has the power of recollection. In another place we will\r\ntreat more accurately of the disposition and manner of life in each\r\nclass.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n1. All animals possess in common those parts by which they take in\r\nfood, and into which they receive it. But these parts agree or differ\r\nin the same way as all the other parts of bodies, that is, either in\r\nshape or size, or proportion or position; and besides these, almost\r\nall animals possess many other parts in common, such as those by which\r\nthey reject their excrements, (and the part by which they take their\r\nfood,)[13] though this does not exist in all. The part by which the\r\nfood is taken in is called the mouth, that which receives the food from\r\nthe mouth is called the stomach. The part by which they reject the\r\nexcrement has many names.\r\n\r\n[13] The words in brackets should probably be excluded from the text.\r\n\r\n2. The excrement being of two kinds, the animals which possess\r\nreceptacles for the fluid excrement have also receptacles for the dry;\r\nbut those which have the latter are not always furnished with the\r\nformer. Wherefore all animals which have a bladder have a belly also,\r\nbut not all that have a belly have a bladder; for the part appropriated\r\nto the reception of the liquid excrement is called the bladder, and\r\nthat for the reception of the dry is called the belly.\r\n\r\n3. Many animals possess both these parts, and that also by which the\r\nsemen is emitted. Among animals that have the power of generation,\r\nsome emit the semen into themselves, and some inject it into others.\r\nThe former are called female, the latter male. In some animals there\r\nis neither male nor female, and there is a diversity in the form of\r\nthe parts appropriated to this office. For some animals have a uterus,\r\nothers have only something analogous to the uterus. These are the most\r\nessential organs; some of which exist in all animals, others in the\r\nmajority only.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n1. There is only one sense, that of touch, which is common to all\r\nanimals; so that no exact name can be given to the part in which this\r\nsense resides, for in some animals it is the same, in others only\r\nanalogous.\r\n\r\n2. Every living creature is furnished with moisture, and must die, if\r\ndeprived of this moisture either in the course of nature or by force.\r\nBut in what part of the body this moisture resides is another question.\r\nIn some animals it is found in the blood and veins, in others the\r\nsituation is only analogous, but these are imperfect, as fibres and\r\nserum.[14] The sense of touch resides in the simple parts, as in the\r\nflesh and in similar places, and generally in those parts which contain\r\nblood, at least in those animals which have blood; in others it resides\r\nin the analogous parts, but in all animals in the simple parts.\r\n\r\n[14] Fibres and serum, as compared with veins and blood, refer to the\r\ncirculation in animals without red blood.\r\n\r\n3. The capacity of action resides in the compound parts, as the\r\npreparation of food in the mouth, and the power of locomotion in\r\nthe feet or wings, or the analogous parts. Again, some animals are\r\nsanguineous, as man, the horse, and all perfect animals, whether\r\napodous, bipeds, or quadrupeds; and some animals are without blood,\r\nas the bee and the wasp, and such marine animals as the sepia and the\r\ncarabus,[15] and all animals with more than four legs.\r\n\r\n[15] Palinurus, Spiny Lobster.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n1. There are also viviparous, oviparous, and vermiparous animals. The\r\nviviparous, are such as man, and the horse, the seal, and others which\r\nhave hair, and among marine animals the cetacea, as the dolphin and\r\nthose which are called selache.[16] Some of these are furnished with a\r\nblow-hole, but have no gills, as the dolphin and the whale. The dolphin\r\nhas its blow-hole on the back, the whale in its forehead; others have\r\nopen gills, as the selache, the galeus,[17] and the batus.[18] That\r\nis called the egg of the perfect fœtus, from which the future animal\r\nis produced, from a part at first, while the remainder serves for its\r\nfood. The worm is that from the whole of which the future animal is\r\nproduced, and the fœtus afterwards acquires parts and increases in size.\r\n\r\n[16] Cartilaginous fishes.\r\n\r\n[17] Squalus galeus.\r\n\r\n[18] Raia batos.\r\n\r\n2. Some viviparous animals are internally oviparous, as the selache;\r\nothers are internally viviparous, as mankind and the horse. In\r\ndifferent animals the fœtus assumes a different form, when first\r\nbrought into the world, and is either a living creature, an egg, or\r\na worm. The eggs of some animals, as birds, are hard-shelled, and\r\nare of two colours. Those of the selache and some other animals are\r\nsoft-skinned, and have only one colour. Some species of the vermiform\r\nfœtus are capable of motion, others are not. But in another place, when\r\nwe treat of generation, we will dwell more accurately on these subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n1. Some animals have feet, others have none; of the former some have\r\ntwo feet, as mankind and birds only; others have four, as the lizard\r\nand the dog; others, as the scolopendra and bee, have many feet; but\r\nall have their feet in pairs.\r\n\r\n2. And among apodous swimming animals some have fins, as fish; and of\r\nthese some have two fins in the upper and two in the lower part of\r\ntheir bodies, as the chrysophys[19] and labrax;[20] others, which are\r\nvery long and smooth, have only two fins, as the eel and conger; others\r\nhave none at all, as the lamprey and others, which live in the sea as\r\nserpents do on land, and in like manner swim in moist places; and some\r\nof the genus selache, as those which are flat and have tails, as the\r\nbatos and trygon, have no fins; these fish swim by means of their flat\r\nsurfaces; but the batrachus[21] has fins, and so have all those fish\r\nwhich are not very thin in proportion to their width.\r\n\r\n[19] Sparus auratus.\r\n\r\n[20] Perca labrax.\r\n\r\n[21] Lophius piscatorius and also L. barbatus.\r\n\r\n3. But the animals which have apparent feet, as the cephalopods, swim\r\nboth with their feet and fins, and move quickly upon the hollow parts\r\nof their bodies, as the sepia, teuthis, and polypus: but none of them\r\ncan walk except the polypus. Those animals which have hard skins, as\r\nthe carabus, swim with their hinder parts, and move very quickly upon\r\ntheir tail, with the fins which are upon it, and the newt both with its\r\nfeet and tail, and (to compare small things with great) it has a tail\r\nlike the glanis.[22]\r\n\r\n[22] Silurus glanis, L. (Strack).\r\n\r\n4. Some winged animals, as the eagle and the hawk, are feathered;\r\nothers, as the cockchafer and the bee, membranaceous wings; and others,\r\nas the alopex[23] and the bat, have wings formed of skin. Both the\r\nfeathered and leather-winged tribes have blood; but the insects,\r\nwhich have naked wings, have no blood. Again, the feathered and\r\nleather-winged animals are all either bipeds or apodous, for they say\r\nthat there are winged serpents in Ethiopia.[24]\r\n\r\n[23] Probably some kind of flying squirrel.\r\n\r\n[24] Herodotus, ii. 76; \"the form of this serpent is similar to that of\r\nthe water-snake; its wings are not feathered, but like those of bats:\"\r\nthe _draco volans_ may have given rise to this story.\r\n\r\n5. The feathered tribe of animals is called birds; the other two\r\ntribes have no exact names. Among winged creatures without blood\r\nsome are coleopterous, for they have elytra over their wings, as the\r\ncockchafer and the beetles, and others are without elytra. The animals\r\nof this class have either two or four wings. Those with four wings are\r\ndistinguished by their greater size or a caudal sting. The diptera are\r\neither such as are small, or have a sting in their head. The coleoptera\r\nhave no sting at all; the diptera have a sting in their head, as the\r\nfly, horse-fly, gad-fly, and gnat.\r\n\r\n6. All bloodless animals, except a few marine species of the\r\ncephalopoda, are smaller than those which have blood. These animals\r\nare the largest in warm waters, and more so in the sea than on the\r\nland, and in fresh water. All creatures that are capable of motion are\r\nmoved by four or more limbs. Those with blood have four limbs only,\r\nas man has two hands and two feet. Birds have two wings and two feet;\r\nquadrupeds and fishes have four feet or four fins. But those animals\r\nwhich have two wings or none at all, as the serpent, are nevertheless\r\nmoved by four limbs; for the bendings of their body are four in number,\r\nor two when they have two wings.\r\n\r\n7. Those bloodless animals which have more than four feet, whether\r\nfurnished with feet or wings, always have more than four organs of\r\nlocomotion, as the ephemera, which has four feet and four wings; and in\r\nthis it not only agrees with its peculiar manner of life, from which\r\nalso it derives its name, but also that it is winged and four-footed;\r\nand all creatures, whether they have four feet or many feet, move in\r\nthe same direction, for they all move in the long way of their bodies.\r\nAll other animals have two leading feet, the crab alone has four.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n1. The following are the principal classes which include other\r\nanimals--birds, fishes, cetacea. All these have red blood. There is\r\nanother class of animals covered with a shell, and called shell fish,\r\nand an anonymous class of soft-shelled animals (malacostraca), which\r\nincludes carabi, carcini, and astaci; and another of mollusca, such as\r\nteuthis, teuthos, and sepia; and another class of annulose animals.\r\nAll these are without blood, and the species with feet have many feet.\r\nThere are no large classes of other animals; for there are many forms\r\nwhich are not included under a single form, but either stand alone,\r\nhaving no specific difference, as man, or have specific differences,\r\nbut the classes are anonymous.\r\n\r\n2. All animals with four feet and no wings have blood. Some of these\r\nare viviparous, others oviparous. The viviparous are not all covered\r\nwith hair, but the oviparous have scales. The scale of a reptile is\r\nsimilar in situation to the scale of a fish. The class of serpents,\r\nsanguineous land animals, is naturally without feet. Though some have\r\nfeet, this class is also covered with scales. All serpents, except the\r\nviper, are oviparous. The viper alone is viviparous, so that not all\r\nviviparous animals have hair; for some fishes also are viviparous. All\r\nanimals, however, that have hair are viviparous; for we may consider\r\nthe prickles of the hedgehog and porcupine as analogous to the hair of\r\nanimals; for they answer the purpose of hair, and not, as in marine\r\nanimals that are so covered, of feet.[25]\r\n\r\n[25] The Echinidæ.\r\n\r\n3. There are also many classes of viviparous quadrupeds, but they have\r\nnever received names. Each kind must, therefore, be taken separately,\r\nas man, as we speak of lion, stag, horse, dog, and of others in like\r\nmanner. There is, however, one class of those that have a mane called\r\nlophuri,[26] as the horse, ass, mule, ginnus,[27] hinnus, and those\r\nwhich in Syria are called mules,[28] from their resemblance, though\r\nnot quite of the same form. They copulate and produce young from each\r\nother, so that it is necessary to consider well the nature of each of\r\nthem separately.\r\n\r\n[26] Animals with long hair on their tails.\r\n\r\n[27] Ginnus is the offspring of a mule and mare. Book vi. 24, 1.\r\n\r\n[28] Hemionus, perhaps the foal of a horse and wild ass, and so\r\ndistinct from oreus, the foal of the he-ass and mare.\r\n\r\n4. We have now treated of these things in an outline, for the sake of\r\ngiving a taste of what we are afterwards to consider, and of how many.\r\nHereafter we will speak of them more accurately, in order that we may\r\nfirst of all examine into their points of difference and agreement;\r\nand afterwards we will endeavour to inquire into the causes of these\r\nthings, but it will be a more natural arrangement to do so when we\r\ntreat of the history of each. For it is evident from these things what\r\nthey are, and what we have to demonstrate.\r\n\r\n5. Our first subject of consideration must be the parts of which\r\nanimals are made up, for these constitute the chief and the whole\r\ndifference among them; either because they have them or are without\r\nthem, or these parts vary in position or arrangement, or in any of the\r\ndifferences mentioned before, in form, size, proportion, and difference\r\nof accidents. First of all, then, we will consider the parts of the\r\nhuman body; for, as every one can best understand the standard of\r\nmoney with which he is most familiar, so it is in other things. And of\r\nnecessity, man must be the best known to us of all animals. The parts\r\nof the body are, indeed, plain enough to every one's common sense; but,\r\nthat we may not forsake our arrangement, and may have reason as well as\r\nperception, we will speak, first of all, of the organic, and afterwards\r\nof the simple, parts.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n1. These are the principal parts into which the whole body is divided.\r\nThe head, neck, trunk, two arms, and two legs. The whole cavity, from\r\nthe neck to the pudenda, is called the trunk. That part of the head\r\nwhich is covered with hair is called the cranium, the fore part of this\r\nis called the sinciput. This is the last formed, being the last bone\r\nin the body which becomes hard; the hinder part is the occiput, and\r\nbetween the occiput and sinciput is the crown of the head. The brain is\r\nplaced beneath the sinciput, and the occiput is empty;[29] the cranium\r\nis a thin spherical bone covered with a skin without flesh. The skull\r\nhas sutures: in women there is but one placed in a circle; men have\r\ngenerally three joined in one, and a man's skull has been seen without\r\nany sutures at all. The middle and smooth part of the hair is called\r\nthe crown of the head; in some persons this is double, for there are\r\nsome people double-crowned, not from any formation of the bone, but\r\nonly from the division of the hair.\r\n\r\n[29] This mistake is again repeated in Ch. xiii.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n1. The part immediately beneath the cranium is called the face in\r\nmankind alone, for we do not speak of the face of a fish or of an ox;\r\nthe part immediately beneath the sinciput and between the eyes is\r\ncalled the forehead. Those in whom this feature is large are tardy;\r\nthose who have a small forehead are easily excited; a broad forehead\r\nbelongs to those who are liable to be carried away by their feelings; a\r\nround forehead is a sign of a passionate disposition.\r\n\r\n2. Under the forehead are two eyebrows; if they are straight, it is a\r\nmark of a gentle disposition; the eyebrows bent down to the nose are\r\nan evidence of an austere temper; if they incline towards the temples,\r\nof a mocker and scoffer; if they are drawn down, it is a sign of an\r\nenvious person. Beneath these are the eyes, which by nature are two in\r\nnumber: the parts of each eye are, first, the upper and under eyelid,\r\nthe edges of which are furnished with hair. Within the eye, the moist\r\npart with which we see is called the pupil; round this is the iris,\r\nand this is surrounded by the white. Two corners of the eye are formed\r\nat the junction of the eyelids, one in the direction of the nose, the\r\nother towards the temple. If these corners are large, they are a sign\r\nof an evil disposition; if those near the nose are fleshy, and have a\r\nswollen appearance, they are an evidence of wickedness.\r\n\r\n3. All other classes of animals have eyes, except shell-fish, and some\r\nother imperfect creatures, and all viviparous animals except moles have\r\neyes. A person might, however, conclude from the following observation,\r\nthat it has eyes, though it is quite without them, for it certainly\r\ndoes not see at all, nor has it any external eyes; but, when the skin\r\nis taken off, there is a place for the eyes, and the iris of the eye is\r\nin the place which it would naturally occupy on the outside, as if they\r\nhad been wounded in their birth, and the skin had grown over the place.\r\n\r\n4. The white of the eye is generally the same in all animals, but the\r\niris is very different. In some it is black, in others decidedly grey,\r\nin others dark grey, and in some it is the colour of the goat's eye,\r\nand this is a sign of the best disposition, and is most to be prized\r\nfor acuteness of vision. Man is almost the only animal which exhibits a\r\nvariety of colouring in the eye; there are, however, some horses with\r\ngrey eyes.\r\n\r\n5. The eyes of some persons are large, others small, and others of\r\na moderate size--the last-mentioned are the best. And some eyes are\r\nprojecting, some deep-set, and some moderate, and those which are\r\ndeep-set have the most acute vision in all animals; the middle position\r\nis a sign of the best disposition. Some people have an eye which is\r\nperpetually opening and closing, others have an eye always intent, and\r\nothers a moderately-intent eye: this last is the best disposed; of the\r\nothers, the one is impudent, and the other a sign of infirmity.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n1. The part of the head by which we hear, but do not breathe, is the\r\near; for Alcmæon is mistaken when he says that goats breathe through\r\ntheir ears. One part of the ear has not received any name, the other\r\npart is called the lobe. The whole ear is made up of cartilage and\r\nflesh. Internally, the ear has the nature of a shell, and the last bone\r\nis similar to the ear itself. The sound reaches this part last, as it\r\nwere in a chamber. There is no passage from the ear into the brain, but\r\nthere is to the roof of the mouth; and a vein extends from the brain to\r\neach ear.[30] The eyes also are connected with the brain, and each eye\r\nis placed upon a vein.\r\n\r\n[30] Eustachian tube.\r\n\r\n2. Man is the only animal with ears that cannot move them. Among\r\nanimals which have the faculty of hearing; some have ears, and others,\r\nas winged and scaly creatures, have no ear, but an open orifice in the\r\nhead; all viviparous animals, except the seal, and the dolphin, and\r\nother cetacea, have ears; the selache also are viviparous. The seal has\r\nopen orifices by which it hears; the dolphin can hear, though it has\r\nno ears; all other animals can move their ears, but man alone does not\r\nmove them.\r\n\r\n3. The ears (of man) lie in the same circle with his eyes, and not\r\nabove them, as in some quadrupeds. The ears are either smooth, hairy,\r\nor moderate. These last are the best for hearing, but they do not in\r\nany way indicate the disposition. They are large, or small or middling,\r\nor they are erect, or not at all, or only moderately erect. The\r\nmoderately erect are a sign of the best disposition; large and erect\r\nears are an evidence of foolish talking and loquacity. The part of the\r\nhead between the eye and the ear is called the temple.\r\n\r\n4. In the middle of the face is the nose, the passage for the breath,\r\nfor through this animals inhale and exhale, and through it also they\r\nsneeze; this is the expulsion of a concentrated breath, and is the\r\nonly kind of breathing which is esteemed ominous or sacred: moreover,\r\ninhaling and exhaling is into the chest, and without the nostrils it\r\nis impossible to inhale or exhale, for inhaling and exhaling is from\r\nthe breast by the windpipe, and not from any part of the head. But it\r\nis possible to live without this respiration through the nostrils.\r\nThe smell also resides in this part; this is the sense of odour. The\r\nnostril is very moveable, and not naturally immoveable like the ear.\r\n\r\n5. One part of the nose, namely, the division between the nostrils, is\r\ncartilaginous, but the passage is empty, for the nose is formed of two\r\ndivisions. In the elephant, the nostril is very large and strong, and\r\nit answers to the purpose of a hand, for the animal can extend it, and\r\nwith it take its food, and convey it to its mouth, whether the food is\r\nmoist or dry. This is the only animal that can do so.\r\n\r\n6. There are also two jaws, the upper and the under. All animals move\r\nthe lower jaw, except the river-crocodile, and this moves the upper jaw\r\nonly. Below the nose are two lips, the flesh of which is very moveable.\r\nThe mouth is the centre of the jaws and the lips. The upper part is\r\ncalled the roof of the mouth, the lower, the pharynx. The tongue is the\r\norgan of taste. This sense resides in the tip, and, if food is placed\r\non the broad part of the tongue, the taste is less acute. The tongue\r\npartakes of all the other sensations, as harshness, heat, and cold, as\r\nwell as that of taste, in common with the rest of the flesh.\r\n\r\n7. The flat part of the tongue is either narrow or moderate in size,\r\nthe moderate is the best, and most apt for clear elocution. The\r\ntongue may be either too loose, or tied down, as in stammerers and\r\ninarticulate speakers. The flesh of the tongue is porous and spongy.\r\nThe epiglottis is a portion of the tongue, the double part of the mouth\r\nis the tonsils; that in many divisions the gums, they are fleshy, and\r\nin them are fixed the bony teeth. Within the mouth there is another\r\npart, the uvula, a pillar filled with blood. If this part is swelled\r\nwith relaxation, it is called a grape, and chokes.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n1. The neck is the part between the head and the trunk; the front\r\npart is called the larynx, behind this is the œsophagus. The voice\r\nand the breath pass through the front part, the trachea, which is\r\ncartilaginous, but the œsophagus is fleshy, and placed farther in, near\r\nthe vertebra of the neck. The back of the neck is called the epomis.\r\nThese are the parts as far as the thorax. The parts of the thorax are\r\nsome before and some behind. First of all, below the neck is the breast\r\nwith two mammæ; on these are two nipples, through which the milk of the\r\nfemale passes. The mamma is porous. There is also milk in the breasts\r\nof men. The flesh of the mamma in men is thick, in women it is spongy\r\nand full of pores.\r\n\r\n2. The part below the thorax, in front, is the belly, and of this the\r\nnavel is the centre. Beneath this centre, the part on each side is\r\ncalled the iliac region; the part in the centre, beneath the navel, is\r\ncalled the hypogastric region; the lowest part of this is called pubes;\r\nabove the navel is the epigastric region; the lumbar region is situated\r\nbetween the epigastric and iliac regions.\r\n\r\n3. Of the hinder parts the loin forms the division of the body, whence\r\nalso its name is derived (ὀσφύς quasi ἰσοφύς). The part of the central\r\nregion which is like a seat is the buttock; that on which the thigh\r\nturns, the cotyledon. The peculiar part of women is the uterus; of men\r\nthe penis, it is external, at the extremity of the trunk in two parts;\r\nthe upper part is fleshy and smooth, and is called glans; this is\r\ncovered with an anonymous skin, which, if it is cut asunder, does not\r\nunite again, neither does the cheek nor the eyelid.\r\n\r\n4. Common to this and the glans is the prepuce, the remaining part is\r\ncartilaginous, readily increases in size, and it is drawn in and out,\r\ncontrary to that of the class of animals called lophuri. Beneath the\r\npenis are two testicles, surrounded by a skin called the scrotum; the\r\ntesticles are not of the same nature as flesh, nor are they made of\r\nflesh. In another place we shall treat of the nature of all these parts\r\nmore accurately.\r\n\r\n5. The pudendum muliebre is contrary to that of the male, for it is\r\nhollow under the pubes, not projecting like that of the male, and the\r\nurethra is outside the womb, for the passage of the semen of the male,\r\nand for the fluid excrement of both. The part of the body which joins\r\nthe neck and the breast is called the jugulum; that which unites the\r\nside, the arm, and the shoulder is the arm-pit. The region between the\r\nthigh and the hypogastric region is called the groin; the part common\r\nto the thigh and the buttock on the inside is the perineum, that of the\r\nthigh and buttock on the outside is called hypoglutis.\r\n\r\n6. We have previously treated of the trunk. The hinder part of the\r\nbreast is called the back: the parts of the back are two shoulder\r\nblades and the back-bone; below the thorax, and opposite the stomach,\r\nare the loins; the ribs belong both to the back and the front of the\r\ntrunk, and are eight on each side, for we have never heard anything\r\nworthy of credit concerning the Ligyes, who are said to have seven ribs.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n1. Man has upper and lower side, the front and the back, and right and\r\nleft side. The right and the left are nearly alike in their parts and\r\nin every particular, except that the left side is the weaker; but the\r\nback parts are not like the front; nor the lower parts to the upper,\r\nexcept in this particular, that the parts below the hypogastric region\r\nare full-fleshed or lean in proportion to the face, and the arms also\r\nanswer to the proportion of the legs. Those persons who have a short\r\nhumerus have also generally a short thigh: those who have small feet\r\nhave also small hands.\r\n\r\n2. One of the double parts of the body is the arm. The parts of the arm\r\nare the shoulder, humerus, elbow, cubitus, and the hand; the parts of\r\nthe hand are the palm and five fingers; the jointed part of the finger\r\nis the condyle, the unjointed part the phalanx. The thumb has but one\r\njoint, all the rest have two. The bending of the arm and finger is\r\nalways inwards. The arm is also bent at the elbow: the inner part of\r\nthe hand is called the palm; it is fleshy, and divided by strong lines.\r\nLong-lived persons have one or two lines which extend through the whole\r\nhand; short-lived persons have two lines not extending through the\r\nwhole hand. The joint of the hand and arm is the wrist. The outside of\r\nthe hand is sinewy, and has not received any name.\r\n\r\n3. The other double part of the body is the leg. The double-headed\r\npart of the leg is called the thigh, the moveable part is called the\r\npatella, that which has two bones the tibia; the front of this part\r\nis the shin, the hind part the calf of the leg. The flesh is full of\r\nsinews and veins; in those persons who have large hips, the flesh is\r\ndrawn upwards towards the hollow part under the knee, in those who\r\nhave not it is drawn down. The lowest part of the shin is the ankle,\r\nand this is double in each leg. The part of the leg with many bones is\r\ncalled the foot, the hind part of which is the heel. The front part is\r\ndivided into five toes; the under part, which is fleshy, is called the\r\nsole of the foot; the upper part, (the instep,) is sinewy, and has not\r\nreceived any name. One part of the toe is the nail, the other is the\r\njoint; the nail is on the extremity of the toe, and the toes are bent\r\ninwards. Those who have the sole of the foot thick, and not hollow, but\r\nwalk upon the whole of the foot, are knavish. The common joint of the\r\nthigh and the leg is the knee.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n1. These parts are possessed in common by the male and female; the\r\nposition of the external parts, whether above or below, before or\r\nbehind, on the right side or the left, will appear on mere inspection.\r\nIt is necessary, however, to enumerate them, for the reasons which I\r\nhave mentioned before, that its proper place being assigned to each\r\npart, any difference in their arrangement in man and other animals may\r\nbe less likely to escape our notice.\r\n\r\n2. In man, the parts of the body are more naturally divided into upper\r\nand lower than in any other animal, for all the upper and lower parts\r\nof his body are arranged according to the order of nature above and\r\nbelow; in the same way, also, the fore and hind parts, and those on\r\nthe right and left, are placed naturally. But in other animals some\r\nof these parts are either not at all so placed, or they are much more\r\nconfused than in man. The head is placed above the body in all animals,\r\nbut in man alone, as we have said, is this part corresponding to the\r\norder of all things.\r\n\r\n3. Next to the head is the neck, then the breast and the back, the\r\none before and the other behind; and each of them in the following\r\norder:--the stomach, loins, pudenda, haunch, then the thigh and leg,\r\nand, last of all, the foot. The legs have the joint bent forwards, in\r\nwhich direction also is their manner of walking, and the more moveable\r\npart of the legs as well as the joint is bent forward: the heel is\r\nbehind. Each of the ankles is like an ear. From the right and left side\r\ncome arms, having the joint bent inwards, so that the flexures both of\r\nthe legs and arms are towards each other, especially in man.\r\n\r\n4. The senses and the organs of sense, the eyes, nostril, and tongue\r\nare in the same position, and in the anterior part of the body; but\r\nthe hearing, and its organ, and the ears are at the side, and upon the\r\nsame circumference as the eyes. Man has the eyes closer together, in\r\nproportion to his size, than other animals. The sense of touch is the\r\nmost accurate of the human senses, and next to this the taste. In the\r\nrest of his senses he is far surpassed by other animals.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n1. The external parts of the body are arranged in this manner; and, as\r\nI have said, are for the most part named and known from habit. But the\r\ninternal parts are not so well known, and those of the human body are\r\nthe least known. So that in order to explain them we must compare them\r\nwith the same parts of those animals which are most nearly allied.\r\n\r\n2. First of all, the brain is placed in the fore-part of the head, and\r\nit occupies the same position in all animals that have this part, which\r\nbelongs to all sanguineous and cephalopodous animals. In proportion to\r\nhis size, man has the largest brain of all animals, and the moistest.\r\nTwo membranes enclose the brain: that outside the skull is the\r\nstrongest; the inner membrane is slighter than the outer one. In all\r\nanimals the brain is in two portions. The cerebellum is placed upon the\r\nbrain at its lowest extremity. It is different from the brain both to\r\nthe touch and in appearance.\r\n\r\n3. The back of the head is empty and hollow in all animals in\r\nproportion to their size, for some have a large head, but the part\r\nlying under the face is less in those animals which have round faces;\r\nothers have a small head and large jaws, as the whole tribe of Lophuri.\r\nIn all animals the brain is without blood, nor does it contain any\r\nveins, and it is naturally cold to the touch. The greater number of\r\nanimals have a small cavity in the centre of the brain. And round this\r\na membrane filled with veins: this membrane is like skin, and encloses\r\nthe brain. Above the brain is the smoothest and weakest bone in the\r\nhead--it is called sinciput.\r\n\r\n4. Three passages lead from the eye to the brain; the largest and the\r\nmiddle-sized to the cerebellum, the least to the brain itself. The\r\nleast is that which is nearest the nostril; the greater are parallel,\r\nand do not meet; but the middle-sized passages meet: this is most\r\nevident in fishes, and these passages are nearer to the brain than the\r\nlarger, but the least separate from each other, and do not meet.\r\n\r\n5. Within the neck is the œsophagus, which also derives its additional\r\nname, the isthmus, from its length and narrowness, and the trachea. The\r\ntrachea lies in front of the œsophagus in all animals which possess\r\nthis part, that is, all animals which breathe from the lungs. The\r\ntrachea is cartilaginous in its nature, and contains but little blood:\r\nit is surrounded with many smooth rings of cartilage, and it lies\r\nupon the upper part towards the mouth, opposite the passage from the\r\nnostril to the mouth, wherefore, also, if any liquid is drawn into it\r\nin drinking, it passes out of the mouth through the nostrils.\r\n\r\n6. Between the passages is the epiglottis, which can be folded over the\r\npassage which extends from the trachea to the mouth; by the epiglottis\r\nthe passage of the tongue is closed, at the other extremity the trachea\r\nreaches to the middle of the lungs, and afterwards divides to each\r\nside of the lungs. For the lung is double in all animals which possess\r\nthis part, though the division is not so marked in viviparous animals,\r\nand least of all in man. The human lungs are anomalous, neither being\r\ndivided into many lobes, as in other animals, nor being smooth.\r\n\r\n7. In oviparous animals, such as birds and the oviparous quadrupeds,\r\nthe parts are very widely separated, so that they appear to have two\r\nlungs; they are, however, only two divisions of the trachea extending\r\nto each side of the lungs; the trachea is also united with the great\r\nvein and with the part called the aorta. When the trachea is filled\r\nwith air, it distributes the breath into the cavities of the lungs,\r\nwhich have cartilaginous interstices ending in a point; the passages\r\nof these interstices go through the whole lungs, always dividing from\r\ngreater into less.\r\n\r\n8. The heart is connected with the trachea by fatty and cartilaginous\r\nmuscular bands. There is a cavity near the junction, and in some\r\nanimals, when the trachea is filled with breath, this cavity is not\r\nalways distinguishable, but in larger animals it is evident that the\r\nbreath enters it. This then is the form of the trachea, which only\r\ninhales and exhales breath, and nothing else either dry or moist, or it\r\nsuffers pain till that which has passed down is coughed up.\r\n\r\n9. The œsophagus is joined to the mouth from above, near the trachea,\r\nbeing united both to the spine and the trachea by membranaceous\r\nligaments. It passes through the diaphragm into the cavity of the\r\nstomach, is fleshy in its nature, and is extensible both in length and\r\nbreadth. The human stomach is like that of a dog, not a great deal\r\nlarger than the entrail, but like a wide bowel; after this there is an\r\nentrail simply rolled together, then an entrail of moderate width. The\r\nlower part of the abdomen is like that of a hog, for it is wide, and\r\nfrom this to the seat it is short and thick.\r\n\r\n10. The omentum is united to the abdomen in the middle, and is in its\r\nnature a fatty membrane, as in other animals with a single stomach\r\nand teeth in both jaws. The mesenterium is over the bowels; it is\r\nmembranaceous, broad, and fat; it is united to the great vein and the\r\naorta: through it extend many numerous veins at its junction with the\r\nintestines, reaching from above downwards. This is the nature of the\r\nœsophagus, trachea, and the parts of the abdominal cavity.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n1. The heart has three cavities: it lies above the lungs, near the\r\ndivision of the trachea. It has a fat and thick membrane, by which it\r\nis united to the great vein and the aorta, and it lies upon the aorta\r\nnear the apex; and the apex is placed in the same situation in all\r\nanimals which have a chest; and in all animals, whether they have or\r\nhave not a chest, the apex of the heart is forwards, though it often\r\nescapes notice by the change of position in the parts when dissected.\r\nThe gibbous portion of the heart is upwards; its apex is generally\r\nfleshy and thick, and there is a sinew in the cavities.\r\n\r\n2. In all other animals which have a chest the heart is placed in\r\nthe centre; in man it is rather on the left side, inclining a little\r\nfrom the division of the mammæ towards the left breast in the upper\r\npart of the chest; it is not large; its whole form is not long, but\r\nrather round, except that the extremity ends in a point. It has three\r\ncavities, as I have said. The greatest is that on the right, the least\r\non the left, the middle one is of intermediate size. They are all\r\nperforated towards the lungs. It has both the two smaller, and all of\r\nthem perforated towards the lungs, and this is evident in one of the\r\ncavities downwards from its point of attachment.\r\n\r\n3. Near the principal cavity it is attached to the great vein to which\r\nalso the mesenterium is united, and in the middle it is attached to the\r\naorta. Passages lead from the lungs to the heart, and they are divided\r\nin the same way as the trachea, following the passages from the trachea\r\nthroughout the whole lungs, and the passages leading from the heart are\r\non the upper part. There is no passage which is common to them both,\r\nbut by their union they receive the breath and transmit it through the\r\nheart; for one of the passages leads to the right cavity, and the other\r\nto the left. We will hereafter speak of the great vein and the aorta in\r\nthe portion of our work which treats of these parts.\r\n\r\n4. In all animals which have lungs and are viviparous, either\r\ninternally or externally, the lung has more blood than all the other\r\nparts; for the whole lung is spongy, and through each perforation\r\nbranches of the great vein proceed. Those persons are deceived who\r\nsay that the lungs are empty, drawing their conclusion from dissected\r\nanimals, from which all the blood has escaped. Of all the viscera the\r\nheart alone contains blood, and in the lungs the blood is not in the\r\nlungs themselves, but in the veins by which they are perforated. But in\r\nthe heart itself the blood is in each of the cavities, but the thinnest\r\nblood is in the middle cavity.\r\n\r\n5. Beneath the lungs is that division of the trunk which is called the\r\ndiaphragm. It is united to the ribs, the hypochondriac region, and the\r\nspine. In the centre is a smooth membranous part, and there are veins\r\nextending through it. The human veins are thick in proportion to the\r\nsize of the body. Under the diaphragm, on the right side is the liver,\r\non the left the spleen, alike in all animals which are furnished with\r\nthese parts in their natural form and without monstrosity, for already\r\nthere has been observed an altered order in some quadrupeds. They are\r\njoined to the abdomen near the omentum.\r\n\r\n6. The appearance of the human spleen is narrow and long, like that\r\nof the hog. Generally speaking, and in most animals, the liver is not\r\nfurnished with a gall, though this is found in some animals. The human\r\nliver is round, like that of the ox. This is the case also in animals\r\noffered for sacrifice, as in the district of Chalcis, in Eubœa, where\r\nthe sheep have no gall, and in Naxos it is so large in nearly all the\r\nanimals, that strangers who come to sacrifice are surprised, and think\r\nthat it is ominous, and not at all natural. The liver is united with\r\nthe great vein, but has no part in common with the aorta. For a vein\r\nbranches off from the great vein through the liver, at the place where\r\nthe gates of the liver, as they are called, are situated. The spleen\r\nalso is only connected with the great vein, for a vein extends from\r\nthis to the spleen.\r\n\r\n7. Next to these are the kidneys, which lie close to the spine. In\r\ntheir nature they are like the kidneys of oxen. In all animals that\r\nhave kidneys the right kidney lies higher than the left, and is covered\r\nwith less fat, and is more dry than the left. This is the same in all\r\nanimals. Passages lead from them to the great vein and to the aorta,\r\nbut not to the cavity; for all animals, except the seal, have a cavity\r\nin their kidneys, though it is greater in some than in others. The\r\nhuman kidneys; though similar to those of oxen, are more solid than in\r\nother animals, and the passages that lead to them end in the body of\r\nthe kidney; and this is a proof that they do not pass through them,\r\nthat they contain no blood in the living animal, nor is it coagulated\r\nin them when dead; but they have a small cavity, as I said before. From\r\nthe cavity of the kidneys two strong passages lead to the bladder, and\r\ntwo others, strong and continuous, lead to the aorta.\r\n\r\n8. A hollow, sinewy vein is attached to the middle of each kidney,\r\nwhich extends from the spine through small branches, and disappears\r\ntowards the hip, though it afterwards appears again upon the hip. The\r\nbranches of these veins reach to the bladder; for the bladder is placed\r\nlowest of all, being united to the passages which proceed from the\r\nkidneys by the neck which reaches to the urethra; and nearly all round\r\nits circumference it is united by smooth and muscular membranes, very\r\nsimilar in form to those upon the diaphragm of the chest.\r\n\r\n9. The human bladder is moderately large in size, and the pudendum is\r\nunited to the neck of the bladder, having a strong passage above and\r\na small one below. One of these passages leads to the testicles; the\r\nother, which is sinewy and cartilaginous, to the bladder. From this are\r\nappended the testicles of the male, concerning which we will treat in\r\nthe part devoted to their consideration. These parts are the same in\r\nthe female, who differs in none of the internal parts except the womb,\r\nthe appearance of which may be learned from the drawings in the books\r\non anatomy. Its position is upon the entrails. The bladder is above\r\nthe uterus. In a future book we will speak of the nature of the uterus\r\ngenerally; for it is not alike, nor has it the same nature in them all.\r\n\r\nThese are the internal and external parts of the human body, and this\r\nis their nature and their manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THE SECOND.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n1. Of the parts of other animals some are common to them all, as I have\r\nsaid before, and some belong to particular classes, and they agree and\r\ndiffer in the manner often before mentioned. For almost all animals\r\nwhich differ in kind, have also their parts different in form, and\r\nthere are some which have only a proportionate resemblance, but differ\r\nin kind, and others agree in kind, but not in form, and many parts\r\nbelong to some which others have not. Viviparous quadrupeds have a head\r\nand neck, and all the parts of the head, but they differ from each\r\nother in their forms. The lion has one bone in the neck, but has no\r\nvertebræ, and when laid open its internal parts are like those of a dog.\r\n\r\n2. Viviparous quadrupeds have fore-legs instead of arms, and in all\r\nquadrupeds, especially those which have the fore-feet much divided,\r\nthey are analogous to hands, for they use them as hands, and the left\r\nlegs are less at liberty than in men, except in the elephant, and this\r\nanimal has the toes less perfectly jointed, and its fore-legs much\r\nlarger than the hind ones; it has five toes, and short ankles to its\r\nhind legs. It has a trunk of such a nature and length as to be able to\r\nuse it for a hand, and it drinks and eats by stretching this into its\r\nmouth; this also it lifts up to its driver, and pulls up trees with\r\nit; with this organ it breathes as it walks through the water. The\r\nextremity of the proboscis is curved, but without joints, for it is\r\ncartilaginous.\r\n\r\n3. Man is the only ambidextrous animal. All animals have their chest\r\nanalogous to man, but not similar to his, for he has a wide chest, and\r\ntheirs is narrow: no animal but man has pectoral mammæ; the elephant\r\nhas two mammæ, but not on the breast, though they are in that direction.\r\n\r\n4. All animals, excepting the elephant, bend both their fore and hind\r\nlegs in contrary directions, and also contrary to the way in which\r\na man's limbs are bent. For in viviparous quadrupeds, except the\r\nelephant, the joints of the fore-legs are bent forwards, and those\r\nof the hind-legs backwards, and they have the hollow part of their\r\ncircumference opposite to each other: the elephant is not constructed\r\nas some have said, but is able to sit down, and bend his legs, but,\r\nfrom his great weight, is unable to bend them on both sides at once,\r\nbut leans either to the right side or the left, and sleeps in this\r\nposition, but its hind legs are bent like a man's.\r\n\r\n5. In oviparous quadrupeds, as the crocodile, lizard, and such like,\r\nboth the fore and hind legs are bent forwards, inclining a little to\r\nthe side, and likewise also in other animals with more than four feet,\r\nexcept that the middle joint of their last pair of legs is always\r\ndoubtful, and is rather bent towards the side. And man also has both\r\nthe flexures of his limbs in the same direction, and those of his arms\r\nand legs contrary to each other, for he bends the arm backwards, except\r\nthat the external part of the arm is a little inclined inwards, towards\r\nthe side; the legs bend forwards.\r\n\r\n6. No animal bends the joints both of its fore and hind legs backwards.\r\nThe flexure of the cubitus and fore-leg is in a contrary direction to\r\nthe flexure of the shoulder in all animals, and the flexure of the knee\r\nis contrary to that of the hip; so that since man bends his joints in\r\nthe contrary direction to many animals, those which have such joints\r\nas man's also bend them in a contrary direction to many animals. Birds\r\nbend their limbs in a direction similar to that of quadrupeds, for\r\nbeing bipeds, they bend their legs backwards, and have wings instead of\r\narms, or fore-legs, and these bend forwards.\r\n\r\n7. The seal is like a maimed quadruped, for immediately beneath the\r\nscapula it has feet like hands, as are also those of the bear, for\r\nthey are five-fingered, and each of the fingers has three joints, and\r\na small claw: the hind feet are five-fingered, and each of the fingers\r\nhas joints and claws like those upon the fore-feet; in shape they are\r\nvery like the tail of a fish.\r\n\r\n8. The movements of animals, whether they have four feet or more, are\r\nin the direction of the longer diameter of their bodies, and thus also\r\nthey stand, the commencement of motion is always on the right side of\r\ntheir bodies. The lion and the camel, both the Arabian and Bactrian,\r\nwalk with the hind-foot following the fore-foot on the same side, and\r\nthis means that the right foot is not put before the left, but follows\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n1. Whatever parts a man has before, a quadruped has beneath: those that\r\nare behind in man, form the quadruped's back; most animals have a tail,\r\nthe seal has a small one, like that of a stag; hereafter we shall speak\r\nof apelike animals. All viviparous quadrupeds are, so to say, rough,\r\nwith hair, and not like man, who, except on his head, has not much hair\r\non his body, and what there is, is very fine; but his head is more\r\nmassy than that of other animals.\r\n\r\n2. And all creatures that have their upper part rough with hair, are\r\nquite smooth, or only slightly rough beneath; but man is contrary to\r\nthis: and again, each eyelid in man is furnished, with lashes, and he\r\nhas hair on the cheek, and pubes; other animals are not so furnished,\r\nhaving no hair on the lower eyelid, or only a few hairs under the\r\neyelid.\r\n\r\n3. But some hairy quadrupeds are rough all over, as the hog, the bear,\r\nand the dog; the neck of others is the roughest part, as in those which\r\nhave a mane, like the lion; in others which have a mane, the back of\r\nthe neck from the head to the point of the shoulder is hairy, as the\r\nhorse and the mule, and among wild animals with horns, the bonassus.\r\nThe hipellaphus,[31] as it is called, has a mane upon the point of its\r\nshoulder, and so has the pardium,[32] though both these have a thin\r\nmane from the head to the shoulder, and the hipellaphus has a beard\r\nupon its larynx.\r\n\r\n[31] Perhaps Nylghau (Liddel and Scott's Lexicon), or some large kind\r\nof Stag.\r\n\r\n[32] Cameleopard. (Schneider.)\r\n\r\n4. Both of these are horned, and have a cloven hoof: the female\r\nhipellaphus has no horns, it is about the size of a stag; there are\r\nhipellaphi in the country of the Arachotæ, where also are buffaloes.\r\nThe wild differ as much from domesticated oxen, as wild hogs from tame\r\nones; for they are black, and of great strength; their nose is curved\r\nlike an eagle's beak, and their horns lie backwards; the horns of\r\nthe hipellaphus are very like those of the dorcas:[33] the elephant\r\nis the least hairy of all quadrupeds. The tails of animals are like\r\ntheir bodies in roughness, and smoothness, in as many as have tails in\r\nproportion to their size, for some have very small tails.\r\n\r\n[33] Gazelle or antelope, so named from the brightness of its eyes.\r\n\r\n5. Camels have a part peculiar to themselves, called the hump upon\r\nthe back; the Bactrian camel differs from the Arabian; the one has two\r\nhumps, the other but one; and they have another hump below, like the\r\none on their back, upon which the rest of their body is supported, when\r\nthey go down upon their knees. The camel has four mammæ, like the cow,\r\nand a tail like an ass, and the pudendum is behind; it has but one knee\r\nin each leg, and not many joints, as some persons say; this appearance\r\narises from the position of the abdomen. It has a talus like that of an\r\nox, misshapen, and small in proportion to its size.\r\n\r\n6. The hoof is cloven; it has not teeth in both jaws. The cloven hoof\r\nis formed in this manner; the lower part is somewhat cloven, as far\r\nas the second joint of the toes, but the upper part is four-cleft as\r\nfar as the first joint of the toes; there is a membrane uniting the\r\ncloven parts as in geese, the foot is fleshy underneath like that of\r\na bear, wherefore, when camels are used in war, and become footsore,\r\ntheir drivers put them on leather shoes. All quadrupeds have their legs\r\nbony and sinewy and without flesh, that is all animals with feet are so\r\nformed, excepting man, and they are without hips; this is particularly\r\nthe case with birds. But on the contrary, the hips, thighs, and legs of\r\nman are more fleshy than almost any other part of his body, for even\r\nthe calf of his leg is fleshy.\r\n\r\n7. Some sanguineous and viviparous quadrupeds have many divisions in\r\nthe foot, like the hands and feet of man; for some, as the lion, the\r\ndog, and the panther, have many divisions of the foot; others are\r\ncloven-footed, and instead of nails have hoofs, as the sheep, the\r\ngoat, the stag, and the river-horse. Some are without divisions in the\r\nfoot, as the solidunguli, the horse, and the mule. The genus of swine\r\nbelongs to both classes; for in Illyria, Pæonia, and other places,\r\nthere are swine with a solid hoof. Those with a two-cleft hoof have\r\ntwo divisions, before and behind; in those with a solid hoof this is\r\ncontinuous.\r\n\r\n8. Some animals have horns, others have none; most of those with horns\r\nhave also cloven feet, as the ox, the stag, and the goat. We have never\r\nseen an animal with a solid hoof with two horns, and there are only a\r\nfew that have a solid hoof and one horn, as the Indian ass, and the\r\noryx.[34] Of all animals with a solid hoof, the Indian ass alone has\r\na talus. Swine, as I said before, belong to both classes, so that they\r\nhave not a well-formed astragulus.\r\n\r\n[34] Antelope Oryx.\r\n\r\n9. Many animals with cloven hoofs have a talus; no animals with their\r\nfeet in many divisions have a talus, nor has man. The lynx has as it\r\nwere half a talus, and so has the lion, but it is more intricate, as\r\nsome pretend. The talus is always in the hind leg, and it is placed\r\nupright upon the gamb, with the lower part outwards, and the upper part\r\ninwards; the parts called Coa[35] turned inwards towards each other,\r\nand the Chia turned outwards, and the projecting portions upwards. This\r\nis the position of the talus, in all animals which are furnished with\r\nthis part. Some animals have a cloven hoof, and a mane, and two horns\r\nturned towards each other, as the bonassus, an animal which inhabits\r\nthe country between Pæonia and Media.\r\n\r\n[35] Coa, the highest throw with the Astragalus with the convex side\r\nuppermost, opposed to Chia, the lowest throw, sixes and aces.\r\n\r\n10. All animals with horns are four-footed, unless there is any animal\r\nwhich metaphorically, and for the sake of a word, is said to have\r\nhorns, as they say that the serpents in the neighbourhood of Thebes in\r\nEgypt have, though it is nothing more than an appendage, that is called\r\na horn. The stag is the only animal that has solid horns, the horns of\r\nall other animals are hollow for a part of their length, and solid at\r\nthe extremity; the hollow part is principally formed of skin, and round\r\nthis is arranged the solid part, as in the horns of oxen. The stag is\r\nthe only animal which casts its horns; they are reproduced; this takes\r\nplace every year after the animal has attained the age of two years;\r\nother animals never lose their horns unless destroyed by violence.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n1. The parts of the mammæ also, and the organs of generation, are\r\ndifferent in man and in other animals. For some have the mammæ forward\r\non or near the breast, and two mammæ with two nipples, as man and the\r\nelephant, as I said before, for the elephant has two mammæ near the\r\narm-pits; in the female they are small, and do not bear any proportion\r\nto the size of the animal, so that they are scarcely visible in a side\r\nview; the males also have mammæ as well as the females, but they are\r\nexceedingly small.\r\n\r\n2. The bear has four, other animals have two mammæ upon the thighs,\r\nand two nipples like sheep; others have four nipples, as the cow; some\r\nanimals have not their nipples on the breast and thighs, but on the\r\nabdomen, as the dog and the hog, they have many nipples, but not all of\r\nthe same size; other animals also have more than two, as the panther,\r\nwhich has four on the abdomen; the lioness has two on the abdomen, the\r\ncamel has two mammæ and four nipples, like the cow.\r\n\r\n3. Among animals with a solid hoof the males have no mammæ, except some\r\nhorses which bear a resemblance to their dams. Some males have the\r\npenis external, as man, and the horse, and many others; some internal,\r\nas the dolphin. Of those animals in which it is external, some have it\r\nin front, as those which I have named; and some of these have both the\r\npenis and testicles loose, as in man; others have them close to the\r\nabdomen; some have them more, others less loose, for this part is not\r\nequally free in the boar and the horse.\r\n\r\n4. The elephant has a penis like a horse, but small and less in\r\nproportion to the size of its body; its testicles are not external but\r\ninternal, and near the kidneys, wherefore also the work of copulation\r\nis quickly performed. The female has the pudendum in the same position\r\nas the udder of the sheep, and when excited with desire, it is lifted\r\nup outwards, so as to be ready for copulation with the male; and the\r\norifice of the pudendum is very wide. Most animals have the penis in\r\nthe same direction, but some are retromingent, as the lynx, lion,\r\ncamel, and hare. In some males, as I have said, the direction of the\r\npenis is different, but all females are retromingent, for even in the\r\nfemale elephant the pudendum is placed under the thighs, as in other\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\n5. The penis is very different in different animals, for in some it is\r\ncartilaginous and fleshy, as in man; the fleshy part does not swell,\r\nbut the cartilaginous portion is erected; in others it is sinewy, as\r\nthe camel and the stag; in others it is bony, as the fox and the wolf,\r\nthe weasel and the martin, for the martin also has a bony penis.\r\n\r\n6. Again, man being a perfect animal, has the upper part of his\r\nbody less than the lower part; the contrary is the case with other\r\nsanguineous animals: by the upper portion of his body we mean the\r\nportion of his body from the head to the anus, and by the lower,\r\nthe parts from hence downwards. In those animals which have feet the\r\nhind leg is the lower part of the body in point of size; and in those\r\nwithout legs, the same relation is observed in their various kinds of\r\ntails. Such is the nature of perfected animals, but they differ in the\r\ndevelopment of their parts. Man in the young state has the upper part\r\nof his body greater than the lower; but as he grows the proportion of\r\nhis parts changes, wherefore also he is the only animal which does not\r\nmove in the same way when young and when grown up, for at first a child\r\ncrawls like a four-footed animal.\r\n\r\n7. Some animals grow in the same proportion throughout, as the\r\ndog--others when they are first born have their upper part\r\nproportionally less than the lower, but as they approach maturity, the\r\nupper parts increase in size, as in the lophuri, for in these animals\r\nthe part from the hoof to the haunch never grows after their birth.\r\n\r\n8. There is a great difference in the teeth of animals, both among\r\nthemselves and from the human type; all viviparous and sanguineous\r\nquadrupeds have teeth; some have teeth in both jaws, which others have\r\nnot; this is the first distinction. Those which have horns do not\r\npossess teeth in both jaws, for they have no front teeth in the upper\r\njaw. There are others, as the camel, which, though it has no horns, has\r\nnot teeth in the upper jaw.\r\n\r\n9. Some animals have tusks like the boar, others have not; some have\r\npointed teeth, as the lion, panther, and dog; the teeth of others have\r\nan even surface, as the ox and the horse. Animals with pointed teeth\r\nhave their teeth fitting into each other; no animal has both tusks and\r\nhorns, neither those with pointed teeth nor any others. Most animals\r\nhave their front teeth sharp, and their hind teeth flat; all the teeth\r\nof the seal are sharp pointed, showing an approximation to the race of\r\nfishes, for all fishes have pointed teeth.\r\n\r\n10. None of these genera have a double row of teeth. But, if we may\r\nbelieve Ctesias, there are some which have this peculiarity, for he\r\nmentions an Indian animal called martichora, which had three rows of\r\nteeth in each jaw; it is as large and as rough as a lion, and has\r\nsimilar feet, but its ears and face are like those of a man; its eye is\r\ngrey, and its body red; it has a tail like a land scorpion, in which\r\nthere is a sting; it darts forth the spines with which it is covered\r\ninstead of hair, and it utters a noise resembling the united sound of\r\na pipe and a trumpet; it is not less swift of foot than a stag, and is\r\nwild, and devours men.\r\n\r\n11. Man sheds his teeth, and so do other animals, as the horse, the\r\nmule, and the ass; man sheds his front teeth, but no animal sheds the\r\nmolar teeth; swine do not shed any of their teeth. About dogs, there\r\nis some doubt; some persons think they do not shed their teeth at all,\r\nothers that they shed only the canine teeth; but it has been observed\r\nthat they do shed their teeth like men: perhaps it has escaped notice,\r\nbecause they do not shed them before the inner ones, which are similar,\r\nare grown up.\r\n\r\n12. And it is probable that the same takes place in other wild animals,\r\nsince they are said only to shed their canine teeth. Young dogs are\r\nknown from old ones by their teeth, for young dogs have sharp white\r\nteeth, old dogs have them black and blunted. The horse is in this\r\nrespect different from all other animals; for while the teeth in other\r\nanimals become darker as they grow older, in the horse they become more\r\nwhite.\r\n\r\n13. Those which are called canine teeth are placed between the cutting\r\nand the molar teeth, and partake of the nature of both, for they are\r\nwide below, but sharp at the top. The male has more teeth than the\r\nfemale in mankind, and sheep, and goats, and swine. This has not been\r\nobserved in other animals. Those persons which have the greatest number\r\nof teeth are the longest lived; those which have them widely separated,\r\nsmaller, and more scattered, are generally more short lived.\r\n\r\n14. The last molar teeth, which are called wisdom teeth, appear, both\r\nin the male and female about the age of twenty, and some women cut the\r\nmolar teeth at eighty years of age, causing great pain in the extremity\r\nof the jaw, and some men also: this happens with persons who do not cut\r\ntheir wise teeth at the proper age.\r\n\r\n15. The elephant has four teeth on each side, with which he grinds his\r\nfood, for he reduces his food very small, like meal. Besides these,\r\nhe has two tusks: in the male these are large, and turned upwards; in\r\nthe female they are small, and bent in the contrary direction. The\r\nelephant has teeth as soon as it is born; but the tusks are small, and\r\ntherefore inconspicuous at first. It has so small a tongue within its\r\nmouth, that it is difficult to see it.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n1. Animals have very differently-sized mouths, for some have wide, open\r\nmouths, as the dog, the lion, and all animals with pointed teeth; other\r\nanimals have a small mouth, as man, or a moderately-sized one, as the\r\nswine. The Egyptian river-horse has a mane like a horse, and a cloven\r\nhoof like the ox; it has a flat face; the talus is like that of other\r\nanimals with cloven hoofs, and it has large projecting teeth; it has a\r\ntail like a hog, and utters a sound like the neighing of a horse; it\r\nis about the size of an ass, and its skin is so thick that shields are\r\nmade of it; its intestines are like those of a horse or ass.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n1. Some animals unite in their nature the characteristics of man and\r\nquadrupeds, as apes, monkeys, and cynocephali. The monkey is an ape\r\nwith a tail; cynocephali have the same form as apes, but are larger and\r\nstronger, and their faces are more like dogs' faces; they are naturally\r\nfierce, and their teeth are more like dogs' teeth, and stronger than in\r\nother genera.\r\n\r\n2. The apes are hairy in their upper parts, so as to bear some\r\nresemblance to quadrupeds, and also in the lower, because they are like\r\nmen, for in this particular, as I said before, there is a difference\r\nin men and brutes; their hair is coarse, and apes are rough both above\r\nand below. They bear a strong likeness to men in their face, for their\r\nnostrils, ears, and teeth, both the fore and back teeth, are like his;\r\nand as for eye-lashes, though other animals are entirely without them,\r\nthe ape has them on the lower eye-lid; they are, however, very thin,\r\nand altogether small.\r\n\r\n3. Upon the breast are two small mammæ, with two nipples; the arms are\r\nlike those of man, but hairy; both the arms and legs are bent like\r\nthose of man, the curves of the limbs being turned towards each other.\r\nBesides these, it has hands, fingers, and nails like those of man, but\r\nall indicating an approximation to the brute; their feet are peculiar,\r\nfor they are like great hands. The fingers upon them are like those\r\non the hands, and the middle one is the longest; the sole of the foot\r\nis like a hand, except that it extends the whole length of the hand\r\nlike a palm, and is hard at the extremity, and is a bad and obscure\r\nrepresentation of a heel.\r\n\r\n4. The feet are used for both the purposes of hands and feet, and are\r\nbent like hands. The humerus and the femur are short compared with the\r\ncubitus and the leg. The navel is not prominent, and there is a hard\r\nplace about the region of the navel. Like quadrupeds, the upper part\r\nof the body is much larger than the lower, almost in the proportion of\r\nfive to three, and the feet are like hands, and as it were made up of\r\nhands and feet, a foot as far as the extremity of the heel, and the\r\nremainder like a hand, for the fingers are furnished with something\r\nlike a palm.\r\n\r\n5. The ape passes more of its time as a quadruped than a biped, and\r\nlike a quadruped, it has no nates, nor has it a tail like a biped, but\r\nonly something in representation of a tail. The pudendum of the female\r\nresembles that of a woman; that of the male is more like a dog's. The\r\nmonkey, as I said before, has a tail, and all the internal parts of the\r\nbody are like those of man. The external parts of viviparous quadrupeds\r\nare of this nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n1. Oviparous and sanguineous quadrupeds (for no sanguineous land animal\r\nthat is not either a quadruped or apodal is oviparous) have a head,\r\nneck, back, upper and lower parts of the body, and fore and hind legs,\r\nand something resembling a breast, like oviparous quadrupeds: most of\r\nthem also have a large tail, some a small one; all of them have many\r\ntoes and divided feet, and all the organs of sense, and a tongue,\r\nexcept the Egyptian crocodile. And in this respect it resembles some\r\nfishes, for the tongue of fishes is thorny, and not free, and in some\r\nthe place for the tongue is altogether smooth, and without division (so\r\nthat nothing is visible), unless the lips are drawn aside.\r\n\r\n2. They have no ears, only a passage for hearing; neither have they any\r\nmammæ, and the penis and testicles are internal, and not external. They\r\nhave no hair, but are covered with scales, and all are furnished with\r\nsharp teeth. The river-crocodiles have eyes like hogs, and great sharp\r\nteeth, strong claws, and an unbroken scaly skin. In the water their\r\nsight is imperfect, but very good on land. They pass the greatest part\r\nof the day on land, and of the night in the water, for they cannot bear\r\nthe cold air.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n1. The chameleon has the whole of its body like that of a lizard, and\r\nthe ribs, descending downwards, are joined together on the hypogastric\r\nregion, like those of fish, and the back-bone stands up, like that of\r\na fish; its face is like that of the chœropithecus.[36] It has a very\r\nlong tail; the extremity is very smooth, and rolled together like a\r\nthong. It is raised, upon longer legs than a lizard; the joints of the\r\nlegs are bent in the same direction as the lizard's.\r\n\r\n[36] Simia rostrata, or perhaps baboon. (_The identifications of the\r\nanimals, unless otherwise noted, are taken from the German translation\r\nby Strack_, 1816.)\r\n\r\n2. Each of its feet is divided into two parts, having the same relation\r\nto each other as our thumbs have to the rest of the hand: and, for a\r\nshort distance, each of these is divided into toes; in the fore-feet\r\nthe internal part has three, the external two toes; in the hind feet\r\nthe internal part has two, and the external three toes; there is a claw\r\nupon each of its toes like that of birds of prey; its whole body is\r\nrough, like the crocodile.\r\n\r\n3. Its eyes are placed in a hollow, and are very large and round;\r\nsurrounded with skin like the rest of its body, and in the middle is\r\nleft a small aperture through which it sees; this is never covered with\r\nskin. The eye is turned round in a circle, and it can direct its vision\r\nto any side, so that it can see where it will. The change in the colour\r\nof its skin takes place when it is filled with air. It can acquire\r\neither a black colour, like that of the crocodile, or ochreous, like\r\nthat of the lizard, or spotted with black, like the panther; and this\r\nchange takes place over the whole body, for the eyes also change like\r\nthe rest of the body, and so does the tail.\r\n\r\n4. Its movements are slow, like those of the tortoise; when dying, it\r\nbecomes ochreous, and retains this colour after death. The œsophagus\r\nand trachea of the chameleon are similar to the same parts in lizards;\r\nit has no flesh, except a little on the head and cheeks, and upon the\r\nappendage at the end of its tail. It has no blood, except about the\r\nheart, and eyes, and the parts above the heart, and the veins that\r\nextend from these: and even in these there is very little blood.\r\n\r\n5. The brain lies a little above the eyes, and is continuous with them;\r\nand when the outside skin of the eye is taken away, a bright object\r\nshines through it, like a bright ring of brass. Through the whole of\r\nits body many strong membranes are extended, which are much stronger\r\nthan in other animals. It breathes strongly for some time after it has\r\nbeen dissected, and there are some slight movements of the heart; it\r\nalso continues to contract its sides, but not the other parts of the\r\nbody. It has no distinct spleen; and it hides itself in rocks like the\r\nlizard.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n1. Birds also have many parts like the animals described above. For\r\nall these have a head, neck, back, and under parts of the body, and\r\nsomething resembling a breast. They have two legs, and thus resemble\r\nmen more than other animals, except that the joints bend backwards like\r\nthose of quadrupeds, as I said before. They have neither hands, nor\r\nfore-feet, but wings; herein they differ from all other animals. Again,\r\nthe hip is like a thigh, large and united as far as the middle of the\r\nabdomen, so as to look like a thigh, when it is separated from the rest\r\nof the body; and the thigh where it is joined to the leg is another\r\npart. The class of birds with crooked claws have the largest thigh, and\r\nstronger breasts than others.\r\n\r\n2. All birds have claws and many divisions of the foot; in most of\r\nthem the toes are quite separate; but the swimmers have their feet\r\ncovered with a web, but even these have distinct and jointed toes. All\r\nbirds that fly high in the air have four toes; and, generally, these\r\nare placed three forwards, and one backward, like a heel; a few birds\r\nhave two toes turned forwards and two backwards, as the bird called\r\njynx.[37] This bird is somewhat larger than the spize,[38] and is\r\nvariegated in appearance. The formation of its toes is peculiar, and so\r\nis that of its tongue, which is like a serpent's. This it can project\r\nfrom its mouth, as much as the width of four fingers, and draw it in\r\nagain. Like a snake it can turn its neck quite round, whilst the rest\r\nof its body is perfectly still. It has large claws, like those of the\r\ncolius,[39] and it hisses with its voice.\r\n\r\n[37] Jynx torquilla, wry-neck.\r\n\r\n[38] Fringilla, finch.\r\n\r\n[39] Perhaps Corvus galgulus.\r\n\r\n3. Birds have a mouth, but its construction is peculiar, for they have\r\nneither lips nor teeth, but a beak, and neither ears nor nostrils, but\r\nonly passages for these organs, for the nostrils in the beak, and for\r\nthe ears in the head. They have two eyes like other animals, without\r\neyelashes; when heavy with sleep, they close their eyes with the lower\r\neyelid; and all possess a nictitating membrane, which closes the eye.\r\nThe owl-like birds also use the upper eyelid. The same is the nature of\r\nthe scaly animals, as the saurians, and others of this class; all of\r\nthem close their eyes with the lower eyelid, but they do not all wink\r\nlike birds. Again, birds have neither scales nor hair, but feathers;\r\nall the feathers have a stem.\r\n\r\n4. Birds have no tail, but a rump; in birds with long legs, or palmated\r\nfeet, this is short, in others it is large. These last, when they\r\nfly, keep their legs close to the body, but the others stretch them\r\nout behind them. All birds have a tongue, but this differs in various\r\nkinds: some have it large, others small. Next after man, some birds\r\narticulate words better than any other animals; this is particularly\r\nthe case with those with broad tongues. No oviparous animal has an\r\nepiglottis on its trachea: but it can close and open the passage, so as\r\nto prevent any heavy thing finding its way into the lungs.\r\n\r\n5. Some tribes of birds have spurs; this is never the case with those\r\nwhich have crooked claws. Those with crooked claws are more active in\r\nflight; those which have spurs, are heavier in their make.\r\n\r\n6. Some birds have a crest, mostly formed of erect feathers; the\r\ndomestic fowl, alone, is peculiar, for its crest is neither flesh, nor\r\nvery unlike flesh.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n1. Among aquatic animals, there is one class of fish, which embraces\r\nmany forms, and is separated from other animals, for it has a head, and\r\nupper and lower parts, in which last are the stomach and bowels, and\r\na continuous and undivided tail. This is not alike in all. They have\r\nneither neck nor limb, nor internal and external testicles, nor mammæ,\r\nnor has any other animal mammæ that is not viviparous, nor indeed all\r\nviviparous animals, but those only that are internally viviparous, and\r\nnot first of all oviparous. For the dolphin is a viviparous animal,\r\nwherefore it has two mammæ, not indeed above, but near the organs of\r\nreproduction. It has not evident nipples, but, as it were, a stream\r\nflowing from each side. From these the milk exudes, and the young ones\r\nsuck as they follow the mother. This has been distinctly observed by\r\nsome persons.\r\n\r\n2. But fish, as we have observed, have neither mammæ nor any external\r\npassage for the genital organs. In the branchia they have a distinctive\r\norgan, through which they eject the water they have received into their\r\nmouths; and they have fins, most fishes have four, but the long fishes,\r\nas the eel, have only two placed near the branchia, and in this respect\r\nthe cestreus,[40] a fish in the lake of Siphæ, is similar to the\r\neel,[41] and so is the fish called tænia.[42] Some of these long fish\r\nhave no fins, as the muræna, nor have they divided branchia like other\r\nfish.\r\n\r\n[40] Mugil, mullet.\r\n\r\n[41] Muræna anguilla.\r\n\r\n[42] Perhaps Cepola tænia.\r\n\r\n3. Some fish with branchia have coverings over their branchi; in\r\nall the cartilaginous fishes they are uncovered. All fishes that\r\nhave coverings have the branchia placed on their sides; among the\r\ncartilaginous fishes some are broad in the lowest part, as the\r\nnarce[43] and the batos;[44] some very long in the sides, as all the\r\ngaleodea.[45] In the batracus,[46] although the branchia are on the\r\nsides, they are covered with a coriaceous, not a prickly membrane, like\r\nthose of fishes which are not cartilaginous.\r\n\r\n[43] Raia torpedo.\r\n\r\n[44] Raia batos.\r\n\r\n[45] The shark tribe.\r\n\r\n[46] Lophius piscatorius.\r\n\r\n4. In some fishes with branchia they are single, in others double, but\r\nthe last towards the body is always single. Some have but few branchia,\r\nothers have many; but their number is always equal on both sides, and\r\nthose with the smallest number have always one on each side; this is\r\ndouble in the capros;[47] others have two on each side, sometimes these\r\nare single, sometimes double, as in the conger[48] and the scarus;[49]\r\nothers have four simple branchia on each side, as the ellops,[50]\r\nsynagris, muræna, and eel; others have four, all divided except the\r\nlast, as the cichle,[51] perca,[52] glanis,[53] and cyprinus;[54] all\r\nthe galeodea have five double branchia on each side, the xiphias[55]\r\nhas eight, which are double. This is the manner and number of the\r\nbranchia of fishes.\r\n\r\n[47] Perhaps Cottus cataphractus.\r\n\r\n[48] Muræna conger.\r\n\r\n[49] Scarus cretensis.\r\n\r\n[50] Swordfish or sturgeon (L. and S. Lexicon), or Centriscus scolopax.\r\n\r\n[51] A variegated fish.\r\n\r\n[52] Perca fluviatilis.\r\n\r\n[53] Silurus glanis.\r\n\r\n[54] Cyprinus carpis, Carp.\r\n\r\n[55] Xiphias gladius, Swordfish.\r\n\r\n5. And fish differ in other respects besides their gills, for they have\r\nno hair like viviparous quadrupeds, nor scaly plates like oviparous\r\nquadrupeds, nor feathers like birds, but the greater number of them are\r\ncovered with scales; some of them are rough, and a very few are smooth.\r\nSome cartilaginous fishes are rough, others smooth. Congers, eels, and\r\ntunnies are smooth. All fish except the scarus have pointed teeth,\r\nand all have sharp teeth, some several rows of them, and teeth on the\r\ntongue; they have also a hard prickly tongue, so united to the mouth as\r\nsometimes to appear without a tongue.\r\n\r\n6. The mouth of some fishes is wide, like viviparous quadrupeds. They\r\nhave no external organs of sense, nor even passages for smelling or\r\nhearing; but all have eyes without eyelids, though their eyes are\r\nnot hard. All fishes are sanguineous; some are oviparous, others\r\nviviparous; all those that are covered with scales are oviparous. The\r\ncartilaginous fishes are all viviparous, except the batrachus.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n1. The remaining class of sanguineous animals is that of serpents;\r\nthese partake of both characters. The greater portion of them inhabit\r\nthe land, a few inhabiting water are found in rivers. There are also\r\nserpents in the sea very like those on land, except in their head,\r\nwhich is more like that of the conger. There are many genera of\r\nsea-serpents, and they are of all kinds of colours; they do not exist\r\nin the deepest part of the ocean. Serpents are apodal, like fishes.\r\n\r\n2. There are also marine scolopendræ,[56] very like those on land, but\r\nrather less; they live in rocky places; in colour they are redder, and\r\nthey have more feet, and slighter legs than in the terrestrial species.\r\nThese also, like the serpents, are not found in deep places.\r\n\r\n[56] Nereis, or aphrodite.\r\n\r\n3. And there is a small fish which lives among the rocks, which some\r\ncall echineis;[57] some people use it for trials and philtres; it is\r\nnot fit for food. Some people say it has feet, but it has none; the\r\nfins, however, are like feet, which gives it this appearance. I have\r\nnow described the external parts of sanguineous animals, their nature,\r\nand their number, and the differences which occur amongst them.\r\n\r\n[57] Echeneis remora.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n1. First of all we will speak of the internal parts of sanguineous\r\nanimals, for the greatest number of genera differ from other animals,\r\nsome being sanguineous, others ex-sanguineous. The sanguineous genera\r\nare man, viviparous and oviparous quadrupeds, birds, fishes, and\r\nwhales, and perhaps others that are anonymous, because they do not form\r\na genus, but simply species amongst each other, as the serpent and the\r\ncrocodile.\r\n\r\n2. All viviparous quadrupeds have an œsophagus and trachea, situated\r\nas in man, and so have oviparous quadrupeds and birds, though there\r\nis some difference in the formation of these parts; all that breathe\r\nby inhaling and exhaling air have lungs, trachea, and œsophagus. The\r\nposition of the œsophagus and trachea, though similar, is not the same,\r\nnor are the lungs alike in all, nor similar in position.\r\n\r\n3. All sanguineous animals have a heart, and a division in the middle\r\nof the body, called a diaphragm. In small animals its smallness and\r\nthinness render it less apparent. The heart of the ox is peculiar; for\r\nthere is a kind of ox, though not the whole genus, which has a bone in\r\nits heart, and there is also a bone in the heart of the horse.\r\n\r\n4. Not all animals have lungs, fish and those with gills have no lungs.\r\nAll sanguineous animals have a liver, generally a spleen also; but\r\nin oviparous animals that are not viviparous, the spleen is so small\r\nas nearly to escape notice, as in most birds, the pigeon, kite,[58]\r\nhawk,[59] and owl. The ægocephalus[60] has none at all. Oviparous\r\nquadrupeds are of the same nature, for they have a very small spleen,\r\nas the tortoise, emys,[61] phryne, lizard, crocodile, and frog.\r\n\r\n[58] Falco milvus.\r\n\r\n[59] Falco palurabarius.\r\n\r\n[60] Stryx otus.\r\n\r\n[61] Testudo coriacea.\r\n\r\n5. Some animals have a gall upon the liver, others none. Among\r\nviviparous quadrupeds the stag[62] has none, nor the deer,[63] horse,\r\nmule, ass, seal, and some swine. The Achaïnian stag appears to have the\r\ngall in the tail; that which they call gall in these animals resembles\r\nit in colour, but it is not liquid like gall, but more like the spleen\r\nin its internal structure.\r\n\r\n[62] Cervus elaphus.\r\n\r\n[63] Cervus capreolus, or C. Dama.\r\n\r\n6. All, while they are alive, have worms[64] in the head; they are\r\nproduced in the hollow part under the hypoglottis, and near the\r\nvertebræ, where the head is joined on. In size they resemble very large\r\nmaggots; they are numerous, and continuous, in number not generally\r\nmore than twenty. Stags, as I have observed, have no gall, but their\r\nintestines are so bitter that dogs will not eat them if the deer are\r\nfat.\r\n\r\n[64] Possibly Œstras nasalis.\r\n\r\n7. The elephant also has a liver without a gall, but when the part\r\nwhere the gall is attached in other animals, is cut open, a quantity\r\nof fluid like bile, more or less abundant, runs out. Among those\r\nanimals which inhale sea-water, and have lungs, the dolphin has no\r\ngall. All birds and fishes have galls, and all oviparous quadrupeds,\r\nto speak of them at once, have a gall, greater or less; but in some\r\nfishes it is placed upon the liver, as the galeodea, glanis, rine,[65]\r\nleiobatus,[66] narce, and in some long fish, as the eel, belone,[67]\r\nand zygæna;[68] and the callionymus[69] has a gall upon the liver,\r\nlarger in proportion to its size than any other fish. Others have a\r\ngall upon the intestines, extending from the liver by several thin\r\npassages; the amia[70] has it stretched out upon the intestines, and\r\nequal to them in length, and many times folded upon it. Other fish\r\nhave the gall upon the intestines, some at a greater, others at a less\r\ndistance, as the batrachus, elops, synagris, muræna, xiphias.\r\n\r\n[65] Squalus squatina.\r\n\r\n[66] Raia batos.\r\n\r\n[67] Syngnathus acus.\r\n\r\n[68] Squalus zygæna.\r\n\r\n[69] Uranoscopus scaber.\r\n\r\n[70] A kind of marked scomber, mackerel?\r\n\r\n8. And the same genus often appears to have the gall extended in both\r\ndirections, as the conger, in some individuals it is turned towards\r\nthe liver, in others suspended before the liver. The same structure is\r\nobserved in birds, for some have the gall turned towards the stomach,\r\nand others towards the entrails, as the pigeon, crow, quail, swallow,\r\nsparrow; in others it is directed both towards the liver and the\r\nstomach, as the ægocephalus; in others, as the hawk and kite, it is\r\ndirected towards the liver and the intestines.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n1. All viviparous quadrupeds have kidneys and a bladder, but some\r\noviparous animals have neither, as birds and fishes, and among\r\noviparous quadrupeds the marine turtle is the only one that has them at\r\nall proportionate to its size. The marine turtle has the kidneys like\r\nthose of oxen, and that of the ox is like a great many kidneys joined\r\ntogether. In all its internal parts, the bonassus[71] is like the ox.\r\n\r\n[71] Bos grunniens.\r\n\r\n2. The position which these parts occupy is the same in all animals,\r\nand the heart is in the middle of the body of all creatures, except\r\nman. In him it is inclined towards the left side; and, as it was before\r\nobserved, the apex of the heart is directed forward in all, but in\r\nfishes it does not appear to be so, for the apex of the heart is not\r\ndirected towards the chest, but towards the mouth and head, and the\r\ntop of the heart is suspended from the place where the right and left\r\nbranchia are joined to each other, and there are also other passages\r\nwhich extend from the heart to each of the branchia, greater towards\r\nthe larger branchia, and less towards the smaller; but that to the top\r\nof the heart in great fishes is a thick white tube.\r\n\r\n3. A few fishes, as the conger and the eel, have an œsophagus, but even\r\nin these it is very small; in some of the fish that have a liver, it is\r\nplaced on the right side, and has no lobes; in others, it is divided\r\nfrom the commencement; and the greater part is on the right side. For\r\nin some fish each part of the liver hangs down, and the divisions are\r\nnot united at their origin, as in the tribe of fish called galeodea,\r\nand in a species of hare which is found near the lake of Bolba, in the\r\nplace called Sycine, and in other places, so that one might suppose\r\nthat they had two livers, on account of the distances at which the\r\npassages unite, as in the lungs of birds.\r\n\r\n4. In all animals the spleen is naturally situated on the left side.\r\nThe case has occurred that an animal having been opened, has been\r\nobserved to have the spleen on the right side and the liver on the\r\nleft, but such appearances are considered ominous. In all animals the\r\ntrachea reaches to the lungs (its nature will be described in another\r\nplace); and the œsophagus, in all that have this part, reaches to the\r\nstomach through the diaphragm. For most fishes (as I observed before)\r\nhave no œsophagus, but the stomach is united directly with the mouth.\r\nSo that it often happens that, when great fishes are pursuing small\r\nones, the stomach falls forward into the mouth.\r\n\r\n5. All the animals that have been mentioned have a stomach, and in\r\nthe same situation, for it is universally placed under the diaphragm,\r\nand an intestine follows it, and ends in the exit for the food which\r\nis called the anus. But the stomach of different animals is variously\r\nformed, for in the first place viviparous horned quadrupeds, which have\r\nnot teeth in both jaws, have four such passages, and those animals are\r\nsaid to ruminate. For the œsophagus, commencing in the mouth, extends\r\nto the parts just below the lungs, and passes through the diaphragm to\r\nthe great stomach.\r\n\r\n6. The internal part of this is rough, and folded together; and it is\r\nunited, near the junction of the stomach, to the part which, from its\r\nappearance, is called the net, for the exterior is like a stomach, but\r\nthe inside resembles the meshes of a net; in point of size, the net is\r\nmuch less than the stomach. Next to this is the part called echinus,\r\nbecause internally it is rough and channelled; it is nearly the same\r\nsize as the net. Next to the echinus is the enystrum, which is both\r\nlarger and longer than the echinus, and internally covered with many\r\nlarge and smooth folds; after this are the entrails.\r\n\r\n7. This is the nature of the stomach of animals with horns, and no\r\nteeth in the upper jaw. But they differ from each other in the form\r\nand size of these parts; and because the œsophagus is sometimes united\r\nto the middle, and sometimes to the side of the stomach. Most animals\r\nwhich have teeth in both jaws have but one stomach, as the man, dog,\r\nbear, lion, and the wolf. The thos[72] has all its intestines like a\r\nwolf. All these have but one stomach, to which the bowel is united.\r\nBut in some of these the stomach is larger, as the hog and the bear;\r\nthat of the hog is marked with a few smooth lines. In other animals the\r\nstomach is less, not indeed much larger than the intestine, as the dog,\r\nlion, and man. In the forms of their bowels other animals are divided\r\ninto two classes, resembling these types; for in some the stomach\r\nresembles a dog's, in others a hog's, both the greater and lesser\r\nanimals in the same way; and the stomachs of various animals differ in\r\nsize, form, thickness, thinness, and the position of the junction of\r\nthe œsophagus.\r\n\r\n[72] Felis onza, perhaps also canis aureus.\r\n\r\n8. And the nature of the bowels differs in the before-named animals,\r\nthose, namely, which have not, and those which have teeth in both\r\njaws, in size, thickness, and folding. The intestines of the ruminants\r\nare all large, and so are the animals themselves; there are a few\r\nsmall animals of this class, and there is no horned animal which is\r\nvery small. And some have appendages to the intestines, for none of\r\nthe animals with teeth in both jaws have straight intestines. There\r\nare enlargements in the bowels of the elephant, which give it the\r\nappearance of having four stomachs; in these the food is detained, and\r\napart from these there is no receptacle for the food. Its intestines\r\nare very like those of the hog, except that the liver is four times\r\ngreater than that of the ox, and other parts also; the spleen is small\r\nin proportion to its size.\r\n\r\n9. The stomach and intestines of oviparous quadrupeds bear a similar\r\nproportion to each other, as in the land and marine tortoise, the\r\nlizard, and both kinds of crocodiles,[73] and similar quadrupeds; for\r\nthey have one simple stomach, in some it is like that of the hog, in\r\nothers like that of the dog.\r\n\r\n[73] Crocodilus niloticus and Lacerta stellio.\r\n\r\n10. The class of serpents in almost every part of their body resemble\r\nthe saurians, which have feet, and are oviparous, if we add to their\r\nlength, and take away the feet; for snakes are covered with scales,\r\nand have their upper and lower parts like saurians, except that they\r\nhave no testicles, but, like fish, two passages united in one, and a\r\nlarge and cloven uterus, but in other respects their intestines are so\r\nlike those of saurians, except that from their elongated figure their\r\nintestines are long and narrow, that they might be mistaken for them,\r\nfrom their similarity.\r\n\r\n11. For the trachea is very long, and the œsophagus still longer, and\r\nthe commencement of the trachea is close to the mouth, so that the\r\ntongue appears to lie beneath it. The trachea appears to be above the\r\ntongue because this last can be retracted, and is not always in one\r\nposition, as in other animals. Their tongue is long, thin, and black,\r\nand can be put forth for some distance. The tongue of serpents and\r\nsaurians is distinct from that of all other animals, for the extremity\r\nof the tongue is cloven; this is most remarkable in serpents, for the\r\nextremities of their tongues are like hairs. The seal also has a\r\nforked tongue. The serpent has a stomach like a very wide entrail, like\r\nthat of the dog, afterwards a very long and thin intestine, which is\r\nalike to its extremity.\r\n\r\n12. Behind the pharynx is a small kidney-shaped heart, so that at\r\ntimes the apex does not appear to be directed towards the chest, next\r\nto this is a single lung, divided by a muscular passage, very long,\r\nand descending a long distance from the breast. The liver is long and\r\nsimple, the spleen small and round, like that of the saurians. The gall\r\nresembles that of fish, in water serpents it is situated on the liver,\r\nin others generally upon the intestines. They all have pointed teeth,\r\nand as many ribs as there are days in the month, for they have thirty.\r\nSome persons say that in one respect serpents resemble the young of the\r\nswallow, for if their eyes are pierced with a pointed instrument, they\r\nwill grow again, and if the tails of serpents or lizards be cut off,\r\nthey will be reproduced.\r\n\r\n13. The same remarks will apply to the intestines and stomachs of\r\nfishes, for they have one simple stomach, but it differs in form,\r\nfor in some fishes it is like a bowel, as in the one called scarus,\r\nand this is the only fish that appears to ruminate, and the size of\r\nthe intestines is simple and folded together, for it can be resolved\r\ninto one, by unfolding it. The appendages of the stomach appear\r\nto be peculiar to fishes and birds, for birds have them above the\r\nstomach, and few in number, but in fish they are above, and around the\r\nstomach. Some have many appendages, as the gobius,[74] galeus,[75]\r\nperca, scorpios,[76] citharus,[77] trigla,[78] and sparus.[79] But\r\nthe cestreus has many on one side of the stomach, and only one on the\r\nother. Some have only a few, as the hepatus[80] and the glaucus,[81]\r\nand the chrysophrys[82] also has only a few, but some individuals\r\ndiffer from others, for one chrysophrys has many, another has only\r\na few. There are some fish which have none of them, as most of the\r\ncartilaginous genera; others have a few, and some a great many, and all\r\nfish have these appendages very near the stomach itself.\r\n\r\n[74] Gobio, gudgeon.\r\n\r\n[75] Shark.\r\n\r\n[76] Cottus scorpius.\r\n\r\n[77] Probably Pleuronectes rhombus.\r\n\r\n[78] Mullus surmulentus.\r\n\r\n[79] Sparus maina.\r\n\r\n[80] Theutis hepatus.\r\n\r\n[81] Probably Gobio gozo.\r\n\r\n[82] Sparus aurata.\r\n\r\n14. Birds have their internal parts different from each other and from\r\nother animals; for some have before the stomach a crop, as the domestic\r\nfowl, pigeon, dove, and partridge. The crop is a large and hollow skin,\r\ninto which the food is received before it is digested. Hence from the\r\nœsophagus it is narrower, then wider, and where it descends into the\r\nstomach it is smaller.\r\n\r\n15. In most birds the stomach is fleshy and thick, and on the outside\r\nthere is a strong skin, which is separated from the fleshy part. Some\r\nbirds have no crop, but instead of it a wide œsophagus, either wholly\r\nso, or in the part extending to the stomach, as in the colœus,[83]\r\nraven, and crow. The quail has the lower part of the œsophagus broad,\r\nthe ægocephalus has it small but wider, and so has the owl. But the\r\nduck, goose, gull, diver, and bustard, have a wide and broad œsophagus,\r\nand so have many other birds.\r\n\r\n[83] Three kinds of birds are called by this name. Corvus graculus, C.\r\nmonedula, and Pelicanus graculus.\r\n\r\n16. And some have a part of the stomach itself like a crop, as the\r\ncenchreis;[84] and there are some which have neither œsophagus nor a\r\nwide crop, but a large stomach; these are small birds like the swallow,\r\nand the sparrow. A few have neither a crop, nor a wide œsophagus, but a\r\nvery long one; these are birds with a long neck, as the porphyrion.[85]\r\nAlmost all these emit a moister excrement than other birds.\r\n\r\n[84] Falco tinnunculus.\r\n\r\n[85] Fulica porphyrion.\r\n\r\n17. The quail has these peculiarities, for it has a crop, and before\r\nthe stomach a wide and broad œsophagus. And the crop is at a great\r\ndistance from the part of the œsophagus before the belly, considering\r\nthe size of the bird. Birds have generally a small intestine, which\r\nis single when unfolded, and birds have appendages, a few, as I have\r\nsaid, and not placed above, as in fish, but below, near the end of the\r\nintestine. Some birds have not these appendages, though they generally\r\nhave them, as the domestic fowl, partridge, duck, night-raven,[86]\r\nlocalus,[87] ascalaphus,[88] goose, bustard, owl. Some of the small\r\nbirds have them, but they are very minute, as the sparrow.\r\n\r\n[86] Ardea nycticorax.\r\n\r\n[87] Some kind of heron.\r\n\r\n[88] Some kind of owl.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THE THIRD.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n1. We have treated of the other internal parts of animals, their\r\nnumber, their nature and varieties. It now remains for us to speak of\r\nthe organs of generation. In females these are always internal; but\r\nthere is much difference in males, for some sanguineous animals have\r\nno testicles at all, in others they are internal; and in some animals\r\nwith internal testicles, they are placed near the kidneys, in others\r\nnear the abdomen; in other animals they are external. The penis of\r\nthese last is sometimes united to the abdomen, in others it is loose\r\nas well as the testicles; but in promingent and retromingent animals\r\nit is suspended from the abdomen in a different manner. Neither fish\r\nnor any other animal with gills, nor the whole class of serpents,\r\nhave testicles; neither has any apodal animal which is not internally\r\nviviparous.\r\n\r\n2. Birds have testicles, but they are internal and near the loins, and\r\nso have oviparous quadrupeds, as the lizard, tortoise, and crocodile,\r\nand among viviparous animals, the hedgehog. In some viviparous animals\r\nthey are situated internally upon the abdomen, as the dolphin among\r\napodal creatures, and the elephant among quadrupeds. In other animals\r\nthe testicles are external. It has been previously observed, that the\r\nmanner and position of their junction with the abdomen is various, for\r\nin some they are joined on and do not hang down, as in swine, in others\r\nthey hang down as in man.\r\n\r\n3. It has also been observed that neither fishes nor serpents have\r\ntesticles, but they have two passages hanging down on each side of the\r\nspine from the diaphragm, and these unite in one passage above the\r\nanus, by above, we mean nearer the spinal column. At the season of\r\ncoition these passages are full of semen, which exudes on pressure;\r\nthe differences among these may be seen by dissection, and in another\r\nplace they will each be considered more particularly.\r\n\r\n4. All oviparous animals, whether bipeds or quadrupeds, have their\r\ntesticles placed in the loins below the diaphragm, some of a white\r\ncolour, others ochreous, but in all surrounded with small veins; from\r\neach of these a passage is produced, which afterwards become united in\r\none, and, as in fish, open near the anus. This is the penis, which is\r\ninconspicuous in small animals; but in the larger, as the goose and\r\nsuch like, it becomes more conspicuous immediately after coition.\r\n\r\n5. And these passages, both in fish and other animals, are joined to\r\nthe loins below the stomach and between the entrails and the great\r\nvein, from which passages proceed to each of the kidneys; and, as in\r\nfish, the semen may be seen entering them at the period of coition,\r\nwhen these passages become very conspicuous, but when this season is\r\npassed the passages again become invisible. So also the testicles of\r\nbirds are either small or entirely invisible when not excited, but\r\nwhen urged by desire they become very large; this is so remarkable in\r\npigeons and partridges, that some persons have supposed that they had\r\nno testicles during winter.\r\n\r\n6. In some of those animals in which the testicles are placed forwards,\r\nthey are internal and upon the abdomen, as in the dolphin; in others\r\nthey are externally conspicuous upon the extremity of the abdomen.\r\nThese animals are similar in other respects, but differ in this, for in\r\nsome the testicles are uncovered, and others that have external testes\r\nthey are placed in a scrotum.\r\n\r\n7. This is the nature of the testicles of all viviparous animals with\r\nfeet: from the aorta, passages like veins proceed to the head of each\r\ntesticle, and two others from the kidneys, these last are full of\r\nblood, but those from the aorta contain no blood. From the head of each\r\ntesticle to the testicle itself, there proceeds a thicker and more\r\nmuscular passage, which is in each testicle reflected back to the head\r\nof the testicle, and from this point they again unite upon the penis\r\ntowards the fore-part of it.\r\n\r\n8. And both these passages which are reflected back upon themselves,\r\nand those which are seated upon the testicles, are covered with the\r\nsame membrane as the testes themselves, so that unless this membrane\r\nis taken away, they all appear to be one passage. These last passages,\r\nwhich are seated upon the testicle, contain sanguineous fluid, but less\r\nthan those above from the aorta; but in the reflected passages of the\r\nduct which is upon the penis, the fluid is white. A passage also leads\r\nfrom the bladder, and is united to the upper part of this duct, which\r\nis enclosed in the part called the penis as in a husk. The accompanying\r\ndiagram will illustrate the position of these parts.\r\n\r\n9. The origin of the passage from the trachea, _a_; the head of the\r\ntestes and the descending passages, _b b_; the passages which proceed\r\nfrom these, and are seated upon the testicle, _c c_; the reflexed\r\npassages which contain the white fluid, _d d_; the penis, _e_; the\r\nbladder _f_; the testicles, _g g_. But when the testicles are cut out\r\nor otherwise destroyed, the upper passages are retracted; in young\r\nanimals castration is performed by bruising the testicles, in older\r\nanimals by excision. And it has happened that a bull has begotten young\r\nif admitted to the female immediately after castration. This is the\r\nnature of the testicles of animals.\r\n\r\n10. The uterus of the females that possess this organ is not of the\r\nsame nature, nor alike in all, but they differ from each other both in\r\nviviparous and oviparous animals. The uterus is double in all those\r\nanimals in which it is situated near the external organ of generation,\r\none part lying on the right side, the other on the left, but the origin\r\nis one, and there is but one os uteri, which is like a very fleshy\r\ntube, and in most animals, especially those of a large size, it is\r\ncartilaginous. One part of this organ is called the uterus and delphys\r\n(whence the word adelphi, brothers), and the vagina and os uteri are\r\ncalled metra.\r\n\r\n11. In all viviparous animals, whether bipeds or quadrupeds, the\r\nuterus is placed below the diaphragm, as in the human female, the\r\nbitch, sow, mare, and cow, and it is the same in all horned animals.\r\nAt the extremity of the uterus most animals have a convoluted part\r\ncalled the horns; these are not distinct in all oviparous animals; but\r\nin some birds they are placed near the diaphragm, and in some fishes\r\nbelow, as in the viviparous bipeds and quadrupeds. But they are thin,\r\nmembranaceous, and long, so that in very small fish each part of the\r\nroe appears as one ovum, as if the fish which are said to have a\r\ncrumbling roe had but two ova, for it is not one ovum but many, and\r\ntherefore it may be resolved into many.\r\n\r\n12. In the uterus of birds the vagina is below, fleshy and tough, but\r\nthe part near the diaphragm membranaceous and very thin, so that the\r\neggs appear to be outside the uterus. In large birds the membrane is\r\nmore conspicuous, and if inflated through the vagina, it swells and\r\nenlarges at places; in small birds these parts are not conspicuous. The\r\nuterus of oviparous quadrupeds, as the tortoise, lizard, frog, and such\r\nlike, is of the same nature, for the vagina below is one and fleshy,\r\nbut the division and the ova are higher up and near the diaphragm.\r\n\r\n13. In those apodal creatures which are outwardly viviparous and\r\ninwardly oviparous, as the sharks and selachea--[The selachea are\r\napodal, furnished with gills, and viviparous]--the uterus is divided,\r\nand as in birds, it commences below and extends towards the diaphragm.\r\nThe ova are situated between the division, and above near the\r\ndiaphragm; and the animal is produced from the ovum after this has\r\ndescended into the open space.\r\n\r\n14. The difference between the uteri of these fish and others may be\r\nstudied more accurately in drawings of dissections. Serpents also\r\ndiffer much both among themselves and from other animals, for all\r\nserpents except the viper are oviparous; this one is viviparous, though\r\nat first internally oviparous, wherefore, in many respects, its uterus\r\nresembles that of the cartilaginous fishes. The uterus of the serpent\r\nis long, like the body, and descends downwards, beginning from one duct\r\nand continuing on either side of the spine as far as the diaphragm, as\r\nif each were a passage, in which the ova are placed in order; these ova\r\nare not extruded singly, but connected together like a chain.\r\n\r\n15. In all animals that are either internally or externally viviparous,\r\nthe uterus is situated above the abdomen; in all oviparous creatures it\r\nis placed below, near the loins. Those that are externally viviparous,\r\nbut internally oviparous, partake of both characters, for the lower\r\npart in which the ova are situated is near the loins, the other part\r\nwhence the ova are extruded above the intestines. And there is also\r\nthis difference in the uteri of animals: those which have horns and\r\nnot teeth in both jaws have cotyledons in the pregnant uterus, and some\r\nof those also with teeth in both jaws, as the hare, the mouse, and the\r\nbat. But other viviparous animals with teeth in both jaws, and with\r\nfeet, have a smooth uterus. The embryo is not united to the cotyledon,\r\nbut to the womb. This is the manner of the internal and external\r\nheterogeneous parts of animals.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n1. Of the homogeneous parts of animals, the blood is common to\r\nsanguineous animals; and so is the part in which it is contained, which\r\nis called a vein; analogous to these, in exsanguineous animals are the\r\nserum and the fibre. That which especially constitutes the body is\r\nflesh or its analogue: the bone and its analogue; the spine and the\r\ncartilage. Next to this we place the skin, membranes, sinews, hair,\r\nnails, and their analogue; after these, adeps, fat, and excrementitious\r\nmatters; then are fæces, phlegm, and bile, both the yellow and the\r\nblack.\r\n\r\n2. But inasmuch as the blood and the veins seem to occupy the chief\r\nplace, we will first of all speak of these, both for other reasons, and\r\nbecause former writers do not appear to have described them rightly.\r\nThe difficulty of understanding them is the reason of their errors,\r\nfor in dead animals, the nature of the principal veins is obscure, for\r\nthey collapse as soon as the blood has escaped, and it pours out of\r\nthem as from a vessel. No part of the body, except the veins, contains\r\nany blood, except the heart, which has a little; but it is all in the\r\nveins. In living creatures their nature cannot be distinguished, for\r\nthey are internal, and out of sight; so that those who consider them\r\nonly in dead and dissected animals, cannot see their principal origins.\r\nBut some, by the examination of emaciated persons, have distinguished\r\nthe origin of the veins, from the appearance of those which are\r\nexternal.\r\n\r\n3. For Syennesis,[89] a Cyprian physician, speaks thus: \"The larger\r\nveins are thus constituted. From the navel around the loins, through\r\nthe back to the lungs, under the breasts; that from the right to the\r\nleft, and that from the left to the right. That from the left, through\r\nthe liver to the kidney and the testicle; that from the right to the\r\nspleen, the kidney, and the testicle, and from thence to the penis.\"\r\n\r\n[89] Syennesis, a physician of Cyprus. Very little is known of him; he\r\nmust have lived in or before the fourth century B.C.\r\n\r\n4. Diogenes[90] of Apollonia writes thus: \"The veins are thus placed in\r\nman. There are two very large ones, which extend through the stomach by\r\nthe spine of the back, one to the right and the other to the left, each\r\nto the leg nearest itself, and upwards to the head by the collar-bone,\r\nand through the neck. From these great veins others extend through the\r\nwhole of the body, from the right to the right side, and from the left\r\nto the left side. The largest are two from the heart, surrounding the\r\nspine of the back; and others, a little higher up, through the breasts\r\nunder the arm-pits, each to the hand nearest itself; and the one is\r\ncalled the splenetic, the other the hepatic vein.\r\n\r\n[90] Diogenes of Apollonia was an eminent natural philosopher of Crete,\r\nin the fifth century B.C. He wrote a work, περὶ φύσεως, in which he\r\ntreated of natural philosophy in the widest sense of the words: a few\r\nfragments are still extant, of which this quoted by Aristotle is the\r\nlongest.\r\n\r\n5. \"The extremity of these veins is divided, one branch goes to the\r\nthumb, and another to the wrist, and from these many small branches\r\nare extended upon each hand, and the fingers; and others, smaller\r\nstill, branch off from these first veins, from the right side to the\r\nliver, from the left to the spleen and kidneys. The veins, which go to\r\nthe legs, are divided near the junction, and extend through the whole\r\nthigh; but the largest of these extends to the back of the thigh, and\r\nappears thick; another, less thick, passes through the inside of the\r\nthigh, and afterwards veins extend by the knee to the leg and foot. As\r\non the hands, they are distributed upon the tarsus of the foot, and\r\nfrom thence to the toes.\r\n\r\n6. \"A number of small veins are distributed on the stomach and the\r\nlungs. Those that extend to the head, through the jugular region,\r\nappear large in the neck. From the extremity of each of these many\r\nveins are distributed upon the head, some on the right side to the\r\nleft, others on the left side to the right, they all end near the ear.\r\nAnd there is a second vein upon the neck on each side, somewhat less\r\nthan the other, to which the principal veins of the neck are united.\r\nThese pass inwards, through the neck, and from each of them veins pass\r\nbeneath the shoulder-blade and to the hands; and near the splenetic\r\nand hepatic veins there appear others a little less, which they divide\r\nwhen any disease attacks the skin; but the hepatic and splenetic veins\r\nare divided for any disease in the neighbourhood of the stomach.\r\n\r\n7. \"Other veins pass from these, beneath the breasts; and there are\r\nother small ones, which proceed from each of these through the spinal\r\nmarrow to the testicles, and others beneath the skin, through the\r\nflesh, reach the kidneys; in men they terminate upon the testicles, in\r\nwomen on the uterus. The first veins from the stomach are wider, and\r\nafterwards become smaller, until they pass over from the right to the\r\nleft, and from the left to the right; these are called the spermatic\r\nveins. The thickest blood is beneath the flesh, but that which is in\r\nexcess in these places becomes thin, and warm, and frothy.\" These are\r\nthe opinions of Syennesis and Diogenes.\r\n\r\n8. Polybus[91] writes thus: \"There are four pair of veins, one from\r\nthe back of the head through the neck, on the outside, near the spine\r\non either side, as far as the thighs and the legs, afterwards through\r\nthe legs to the ancles, on the outside, and to the feet. Wherefore,\r\nin complaints of the back and thigh, they divide the veins upon the\r\npoplitic region, or ancles, on the outside. Another pair of veins pass\r\nfrom the head, by the ears, through the neck, these are called the\r\njugular veins; and others within, near the spine, lead by the loins to\r\nthe testicles and the thighs, and through the poplitic region on the\r\ninside, and through the leg to the inner part of the ancle, and the\r\nfeet; wherefore, in complaints of the loins and testicles, they bleed\r\nin the poplitic region and ancles.\r\n\r\n[91] Polybus, a pupil of Hippocrates, a native of the island of Cos; he\r\nlived in the fourth century B.C. Many treatises on medical subjects are\r\nattributed to him.\r\n\r\n9. \"The third pair of veins, from the temple through the neck, and\r\nbeneath the scapula, reach the lungs; those from the right to the left,\r\nunder the breast, to the spleen and kidneys; and those from the left\r\nto the right side, from the lungs, under the breast, and liver, and\r\nkidney; and both end beneath the testicles. The fourth pair from the\r\nforepart of the head and the eyes, under the neck and collar-bones;\r\nfrom thence they extend through the humerus to the elbow, and through\r\nthe cubitus to the wrist and the fingers, and through the lower part\r\nof the arm to the arm-pits, and the upper part of the lungs. The one\r\nreaches as far as the spleen, the other to the liver; afterwards they\r\nboth pass over the abdomen to the pudendum.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n1. The opinions of other persons are nearly these; and there are other\r\nphysiologists, but they have not treated so accurately of the veins.\r\nBut all agree in placing their origin in the head and brain, in which\r\nthey are incorrect. But, as I have remarked before, it is difficult to\r\ndiscern the course of the veins; indeed, it is impossible to understand\r\nthem unless a person will examine animals which, after emaciation, have\r\nbeen killed by strangulation. The following is the nature of the veins:\r\nThere are two veins in the interior of the chest, near the spine; the\r\nlarger of these is placed forward, the smaller is behind; the larger is\r\ninclined to the right side, the smaller to the left; and this by some\r\npersons is called the aorta, from the sinewy portion which is seen in\r\ndead animals.\r\n\r\n2. These veins have their origin in the heart, for they pass completely\r\nthrough the other intestines, and always preserve the character of\r\nveins. The heart is, as it were, a part of them, and especially of the\r\nmore forward and larger one, for these veins are above and below, and\r\nthe heart is in the middle of them. The heart of all animals contains\r\ncavities, but in the heart of very small animals the largest cavity is\r\nscarcely perceptible, in moderately sized animals the second cavity\r\nis scarcely visible, but in large animals they are all three distinct\r\nenough. And when the apex of the heart is turned forwards, as I have\r\nobserved, the principal cavity is on the right side, and above it the\r\nleast is on the left side, and the middle-sized one is between them;\r\nthe two smaller are far less than the greater.\r\n\r\n3. All these are perforated towards the lungs, but imperceptibly so\r\nfrom the minuteness of the passage, except in one place. The great vein\r\nis suspended from the upper portion of the principal cavity, and on the\r\nright side; afterwards through the cavity a vein extends again, as if\r\nthe vein were a part of the cavity in which the blood stagnates. The\r\naorta has its origin from the middle cavity, but in a different manner\r\nfrom the vein, for it communicates with the heart by a much narrower\r\npassage, and the vein is continued through the heart. But the aorta\r\npasses from the heart, and the great vein is membranous and like skin,\r\nbut the aorta is narrow and very sinewy, and as it is continued towards\r\nthe head and the lower parts of the body, it becomes narrow and quite\r\nsinewy.\r\n\r\n4. A portion of the great vein is first of all extended upwards\r\nfrom the heart to the lung, and to the junction of the aorta, this\r\nvein being undivided and large; from this place it divides into two\r\nbranches, the one towards the lung, and the other to the spine and the\r\nlowest vertebra of the neck. The branch which goes to the lungs is\r\nfirst divided into two branches, and afterwards it is continued upon\r\nevery tube and passage of the lungs, greater to the greater, and less\r\nto the less, so as to leave no part in which there is not a passage and\r\na small vein. These last are invisible from their minute size, so that\r\nthe whole lung seems to be full of blood.\r\n\r\n5. And the passages from the vein are above the tubes which extend from\r\nthe trachea. And the vein which is continued upon the vertebra of the\r\nneck, and upon the spinal column, returns again to the spine, as Homer\r\nwrites in his poems: \"He cut off the whole vein which passes up the\r\nback and returns again to the neck;\"[92] and from this vein branches\r\nextend to each rib and to each vertebra; but that which is upon the\r\nvertebra near the kidneys branches in two directions. These branches,\r\nthen, of the great vein are subdivided in this manner.\r\n\r\n[92] Iliad. xiii. 546.\r\n\r\n6. And above these, from that part which is continued from the heart,\r\nthe whole is again divided into two directions, for some reach to the\r\nsides and the clavicles, and afterwards through the armpits to the\r\narms, in the human subject, but in quadrupeds to the fore-legs, to the\r\nwings in birds, and to the pectoral fins in fishes. The commencements\r\nof these veins, when they are first of all divided, are called jugular\r\nveins; and having branched off in the neck from the great vein, they\r\nare continued to the trachea of the lungs. And if these veins are held\r\non the outside, men fall down dead with insensibility, with closed\r\neyes, but without choking.\r\n\r\n7. Extending in this manner, and receiving the trachea between them,\r\nthey reach the place where the jaws unite with the head; and again\r\nfrom this point they are divided into four veins, one of which bends\r\nbackwards and descends through the neck and shoulder, and meets the\r\nfirst division of the vein by the joint of the arm; the other portion\r\nterminates in the hand and fingers; and another branch extends from\r\neach part near the ear to the brain, where it is divided into many\r\nsmall branches upon the membrane which surrounds the brain.\r\n\r\n8. The brain never contains blood in any animal, nor does any vein,\r\nsmall or great, terminate upon it; but some of the other branches that\r\nextend from this vein surround the brain in a circle, and others, end\r\nupon the organs of sense and the teeth in very small veins. In the same\r\nmanner, also, the branches of the smaller vein, which is called the\r\naorta, are divided: they are continued beside those of the great vein,\r\nbut the tubes are smaller and the branches less than those of the great\r\nvein.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n1. The veins, then, are thus distributed in the parts above the heart,\r\nbut the part of the great vein which is below the heart passes through\r\nthe middle of the diaphragm, and is united to the aorta and spinal\r\ncolumn by membranous flaccid passages. From this a short and wide vein\r\npasses through the liver, from which many similar branches extend to\r\nthe liver, and disappear upon it. There are two branches of the vein,\r\none of which terminates upon the diaphragm, and what is called the\r\npræcordia, the other returns through the arm-pit to the right arm,\r\nand unites with the other veins near the interior part of the elbow.\r\nFor this reason physicians treat certain diseases of the liver by\r\nvenesection in this vein.\r\n\r\n2. From the left of this there is a short and wide vein, which reaches\r\nto the spleen, and the branches of this vein are lost upon this organ,\r\nand another portion branching off in the same way from the left the\r\ngreat vein passes up to the left arm, except that the last-mentioned\r\npass through the liver, but this one through the spleen. Other branches\r\nalso separate from the great vein, the one to the omentum, the other to\r\nthe pancreas; and from this many veins extend through the mesenterium,\r\nand all end there in one great vein, which passes through the whole\r\nintestine and the stomach, as far as the œsophagus; and many veins\r\nbranch off from them around these parts.\r\n\r\n3. Both the aorta and the great vein continue as far as the kidney each\r\nas a single duct; from this point they are more closely united to the\r\nspinal column, and are each divided into two parts, like the letter\r\nlambda (Λ), and the great vein is placed farther back than the aorta.\r\nThe aorta is more closely united to the spinal column, near the heart,\r\nand the junction is formed by small sinewy veins.\r\n\r\n4. The aorta leaves the heart as a large hollow passage, but as it\r\nadvances it becomes narrower and more sinewy. From the aorta, veins\r\nextend also to the mesenterium, like those from the great vein, but\r\nfar inferior in size, for they are narrow and muscular. They terminate\r\nin small hollow muscular veins. No branch of the aorta extends to the\r\nliver and the spleen, but the branches of either vein extend to each\r\nhip, and both touch upon the bone. Branches reach the kidney both from\r\nthe great vein and the aorta; they do not, however, enter the cavity,\r\nbut are taken up in the substance of the kidney.\r\n\r\n5. Two other strong and continuous passages reach from the aorta to\r\nthe bladder, and others from the cavity of the kidney; but these do\r\nnot communicate with the great vein. From the centre of each kidney a\r\nhollow sinewy vein passes through the other veins to the spinal column;\r\nfirst of all they disappear upon each hip, and then appear again in\r\nbranches towards the hip; their extremities are distributed upon the\r\nbladder and penis in the male, and upon the uterus in the female; no\r\nbranch of the great vein passes to the uterus, but many and thick ones\r\nreach it from the aorta.\r\n\r\n6. From the aorta and great vein branches are distributed to the nates;\r\nat first they are large and hollow, afterwards they pass through the\r\nlegs, ending upon the feet and toes; and others again pass through the\r\nnates and thighs, alternately from right to left, and they join with\r\nother veins below the knees.\r\n\r\n7. The nature and origin of the veins are evident from this\r\ndescription. In all sanguineous animals, the nature and origin of the\r\nprincipal veins are the same, but the multitude of smaller veins is\r\nnot alike in all, for neither are the parts of the same nature, nor do\r\nall possess the same parts. Nor are the veins equally apparent in all\r\nanimals; but they are more manifest in those which have most blood,\r\nand in the largest creatures; but in those animals which are small, and\r\nhave not much blood, either by nature or from excess in fat, they are\r\nnot so easily investigated, for some of the passages are confused, like\r\nrivulets that are lost in beds of mud; and there are some animals which\r\nhave but few, and these fibres instead of veins. The great vein is very\r\nconspicuous in all, even the smallest animals.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n1. The following is the nature of the sinews of animals. The origin of\r\nthese, also, is in the breast, for there is a sinew in the principal\r\ncavity of the heart itself; and that which is called the aorta is a\r\nsinewy vein, for its terminations are always sinewy, for they are not\r\nhollow, and are extensible, like the sinews which end upon the bending\r\nof the bones: for it is not the nature of sinews to be continuous from\r\none origin, like the veins, for the veins have the whole form of the\r\nbody as in outline sketches, so that in emaciated subjects the whole\r\nmass appears full of veins, for the same place is occupied by veins in\r\nlean persons that in fat ones is flesh.\r\n\r\n2. The sinews are drawn round the joints and flexures of the bones;\r\nbut, if their nature were continuous, the continuation would be evident\r\nin emaciated persons. The principal parts of the sinews are around\r\nthe part of the body appropriated to leaping, and this is called\r\nthe poples. Another double sinew is the tendon of the neck, and the\r\nepitonus and the sinew of the shoulder, which aid in the support of the\r\nbody. The sinews around the joints have not received any name, for all\r\nthe bones where they are contiguous are bound together by the sinews.\r\n\r\n3. And there are many sinews round all the bones; there are none in the\r\nhead; but the sutures of the skull are adapted to each other. It is the\r\nnature of sinew to tear readily lengthwise, but across the fibre it is\r\nindivisible, and it is very extensible. The sinews are surrounded by a\r\nmucous, white, and gelatinous fluid, by which they are nourished, and\r\nfrom which they seem to derive their origin. The vein does not alter\r\nits form by combustion, but the sinew is entirely destroyed. Neither\r\ndoes it unite after division.\r\n\r\n4. Numbness does not take place in those parts of the body which\r\ncontain no sinews. The sinews are most abundant on the hands and feet,\r\nand on the ribs and shoulder-blades, and round the neck and arms. All\r\nsanguineous animals have sinews; but in those which have not jointed\r\nlimbs, and are without feet and hands, the sinews are small and\r\ninconspicuous, so that in fishes they are most distinct near the fins.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n1. The fibres are between the sinews and the veins; but some of them\r\nare moistened with serum, and they extend from the sinews to the veins,\r\nand from the veins to the sinews. There is also another kind of fibre,\r\nwhich is produced in the blood of most, but not of all animals. When\r\nthis is extracted from the blood, it does not coagulate, but if it is\r\nnot taken out of the blood it coagulates. These fibres are present in\r\nthe blood of most animals, but not in that of the stag, prox,[93] and\r\nbubalis,[94] and some others; so that their blood does not coagulate\r\nlike that of other animals: the blood of stags is very like that of\r\nhares; for in both of these coagulation takes place; not firm, as in\r\nother animals, but trembling, like that of milk, if no coagulating\r\nsubstance is put into it. The blood of the bubalis coagulates more\r\nthickly, only a little less so than that of sheep. This is the nature\r\nof veins, sinews, and fibres.\r\n\r\n[93] Cervis Capreolus, or C. dama.\r\n\r\n[94] Antilope gnou.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n1. The bones of animals depend upon one bone, and are connected with\r\neach other, like the veins; and there is no such thing as a separate\r\nbone. In all animals with bones the spinal column is their origin. The\r\nspinal column is made up of vertebræ, and extends from the head to the\r\nhips. All the vertebræ are perforated; the upper part of the head is a\r\nbone joined to the last vertebra, and is called the skull, the saw-like\r\npart is the suture.\r\n\r\n2. This is not alike in all animals, for the cranium of some consists\r\nof a single bone, as in the dog; in others it is compound, as in the\r\nhuman subject. The female has one suture, in a circle; the male has\r\nthree, meeting at the top of the head, like a triangle; and human\r\nskulls have been seen without sutures. The head is not composed of four\r\nbones, but of six; two of these are placed above the ears, and are\r\nsmall compared with the rest.\r\n\r\n3. From the head the jaw-bones descend. All other animals move the\r\nlower jaw, the river-crocodile alone moves the upper jaw. In the jaws\r\nare the order of the teeth, which are bony, in some parts they are\r\nperforated, in others they are not. These are the only bones too hard\r\nto be engraved.\r\n\r\n4. From the spinal-column, which is the point of union, originate the\r\nclavicles and ribs; the breast also is placed upon the ribs, and some\r\nof these are united, others are not, for no animal has a bone round\r\nthe stomach. There are also the scapulæ upon the shoulders, and these\r\nare continued upon the arms, and those again to the hands; and in all\r\nanimals with fore legs the nature of the bone is the same.\r\n\r\n5. At the extremity of the lower part of the spinal column, and next\r\nto the hip, is the socket, and the bones of the lower extremity,\r\nwith those of the thigh and leg, which are called the colenes. The\r\nancles form a portion of these, and the part called the spur in all\r\ncreatures with ancles. Continuous with these are the bones of the feet.\r\nViviparous animals with blood and feet do not differ much in their\r\nbones, but rather by analogy, in hardness, softness, and size. Again,\r\nsome of the bones contain marrow, whilst others, in the same animal,\r\nhave none.\r\n\r\n6. Some animals do not appear to have any marrow at all in their\r\nbones, as the lion, whose bones are very small and slight: or there\r\nmay be marrow in a few of its bones, as in those of the thigh and fore\r\nleg; otherwise, in the lion, the bones are particularly solid, for\r\nthey are sufficiently hard to emit fire like stones on concussion.\r\nThe dolphin also has bones, but it has no spine, like fish. Some\r\nsanguineous animals differ partially from these, as the class of birds.\r\nIn others, as fish, the bones are only analogous, for viviparous fish\r\nhave a cartilaginous spine, like those which are called selachea; the\r\noviparous fish have a spine, which is like the backbone of quadrupeds.\r\n\r\n7. It is a peculiarity in fish that some species have small spines in\r\nthe flesh separated from each other. Serpents are like fish, for their\r\nback-bone is spinous; among oviparous quadrupeds the greater animals\r\nhave a bony vertebral column; the lesser have a spinous one.\r\n\r\n8. For all sanguineous animals have either a bony, or a spinous\r\ncolumn. The remainder of the bones exist in some animals, but not in\r\nothers, for if they have the limbs, they have the bones belonging to\r\nthem; for those that have not hind and fore legs have not hams, nor\r\nare they present in those animals which possess limbs unlike those of\r\nquadrupeds, for in these they vary in size and proportion. This is the\r\nnature of the bones of animals.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n1. Cartilage is of the same nature as bone, but it differs in the\r\ngreater and less, and neither bone nor cartilage are reproduced if they\r\nare cut off. In sanguineous and viviparous animals living on the land\r\nthe cartilage is imperforate, and does not contain marrow, like the\r\nbones; but the flat selachea, which have a cartilaginous spine, have\r\na cartilage analogous to bone containing a liquid marrow. Viviparous\r\nanimals, with feet, have cartilage about their ears, nostrils, and\r\nextremities of their bones.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n1. There is another class of parts, which, though not the same as\r\nthese, are not very different, as nails, hoofs, claws, and horns, and\r\nbesides these, the beak of birds which alone possess this part. For\r\nthese are both flexible and fissile. But bone is neither flexible nor\r\nfissile, but brittle; and the colour of horns, nails, claws, and hoofs\r\nfollow the colour of the skin and the hair: for in black animals the\r\nhorns are black, and so are the claws and hoofs in those with claws; in\r\nwhite animals they are white. There are also intermediate colours, the\r\nnails also are of the same nature.\r\n\r\n2. But the teeth are like bones; wherefore, in black men, Ethiopians,\r\nand such like, the teeth and the bones are white, but the nails are\r\nblack, like the rest of the skin. The horns of most animals are hollow\r\nat their base, and surround a bony process on their heads; but at the\r\nextremity the horn is solid and single. The stag's horns are solid\r\nthroughout, and divided; and these animals alone cast their horns; this\r\nis done annually, if they are not cut off. Concerning those that are\r\ncut off, we shall speak hereafter.\r\n\r\n3. The horns are more nearly allied to skin than to bone, so that in\r\nPhrygia and elsewhere there are oxen which have the power of moving\r\ntheir horns, as they do their ears; and of those which have nails\r\n(and all that have toes have nails, and those that have feet have\r\ntoes, except the elephant, which has its toes undivided, and scarcely\r\ndistinguished, and no nails at all)--and of those with nails, some have\r\nstraight nails, like men, others crooked, as the lion among beasts, and\r\nthe eagle amongst birds.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n1. This is the nature of hair and its analogues and skin. All\r\nviviparous animals, with feet, have hair; oviparous animals, with feet,\r\nhave scaly plates; and those fish alone which produce friable ova are\r\ncovered with scales; for the conger and muræna among long fish have not\r\nsuch ova, and the eel produces no ova. The hair differs in thickness,\r\nthinness, and size, according to its situation, both in the parts of\r\nthe body which it occupies, and the nature of the skin, for upon thick\r\nskins the hair is generally harsh and thick, the hair is both thicker\r\nand longer in the hollow and moist parts of the body, if they are such\r\nas to be covered with hair.\r\n\r\n2. And the case is similar in those animals which are covered with\r\nplates or scales. If animals covered with soft hair are placed in good\r\npastures their hair will become coarser; and, on the contrary, it\r\nbecomes finer and less in those that have coarse hair. Warm and cold\r\nsituations also make a difference, for the hair of natives of warm\r\nclimates is harsh, but it is soft in those of colder climates. Straight\r\nhair is soft, crisped hair is harsh.\r\n\r\n3. It is the nature of hair to split; and different kinds of hair are\r\ndissimilar in excess and deficiency; some are so changed by harshness\r\nas to bear slight resemblance to hair, and are more like spines, as in\r\nthe hedgehog, wherein they resemble nails. So again the nails in some\r\nanimals are not different from bones in point of hardness.\r\n\r\n4. Man has the thinnest skin in proportion to his size. There is a\r\nmucous, glutinous fluid in the skin of all animals, less in some,\r\nmore in others, as in the skins of oxen, from which glue is made; and\r\nsometimes glue is made from fishes. When the skin alone is cut it is\r\ninsensible, especially that upon the head, from the absence of flesh\r\nbetween that and the bone. Wherever the skin is without flesh it does\r\nnot unite again after being cut, as the thin part of the cheek, the\r\nprepuce, and the eyelid. In all animals the skin is continuous, and\r\nit is only wanting in places where there are natural passages for\r\nexudation, and at the mouth and nails. All sanguineous animals have a\r\nskin: all, however, have not hair, but those which are described above.\r\n\r\n5. The colour of the hair changes in men as they grow old, and the hair\r\nbecomes grey. This takes place in other animals, but not so remarkably\r\nas in the horse. The hair begins to grow white from the extremity. Most\r\nwhite animals are white from their birth, wherefore it is plain that\r\nwhiteness does not arise from dryness, as some persons suppose, for no\r\nanimal is born dry. In the exanthematous disease, called whiteness,\r\nall the hair becomes hoary; and some patients, who have suffered from\r\nillness, after the hair has fallen off on recovery, have regained their\r\ndark-coloured hair. Hair which is covered up becomes white more readily\r\nthan that which is exposed to the air; in man the temples are the first\r\nto grow grey, and the fore part of the head before the hind part, and\r\nlast of all the hair on the pubes.\r\n\r\n6. Some of the hair exists on the body at the period of birth, and some\r\nappears afterwards. In man alone the hair on the head, eyelashes, and\r\neyebrows exist at birth. The hair on the pubes, in the armpits, and on\r\nthe chin appear successively after birth, so that the parts on which\r\nthe hair appears at birth, and those on which it grows afterwards are\r\nthe same in number. In old age the hair on the head especially is the\r\nfirst to fail, and falls off. This is only in front, for no one ever\r\nbecomes bald on the back of the head. The smoothness on the crown of\r\nthe head is called baldness, that upon the eyebrows depilation; neither\r\nof these takes place before the commencement of puberty.\r\n\r\n7. Children, women, and eunuchs never become bald. If a person be\r\ncastrated before puberty, the hair which grows after birth never makes\r\nits appearance; if after puberty these alone fall off, except the hair\r\non the pubes. Women have no hair upon the chin, excepting a few of\r\nthose in whom the catamenia have ceased, and the priestesses in Caria:\r\nand this appears ominous of future events. Women also have other hair,\r\nbut not much. There are some persons, both male and female, who from\r\ntheir birth are without the hair which grows after birth; but those\r\npersons are barren who have not hair on the pubes.\r\n\r\n8. The rest of the hair grows proportionally, either more or less. That\r\nupon the head grows the most, then that on the chin, and thin hair most\r\nof all. The eyebrows grow so thick upon some aged persons as to be cut\r\noff, for they are placed upon the symphysis of the bone; and this being\r\nseparated in old persons, a more abundant moisture exudes. Those on the\r\neyelids do not grow, but they fall off, when persons come to puberty,\r\nand especially in those of warm sexual desires; they become grey very\r\nslowly. If the hair is plucked out during the period of growth, it\r\ncomes again, but not after it has done growing.\r\n\r\n9. Every hair has at its root a glutinous moisture, which will adhere\r\nto anything with which it comes in contact, soon after it is drawn out.\r\nIn spotted animals the spots exist both in the hair and upon the skin,\r\nand upon the skin of the tongue. As for the beard, some persons have a\r\nthick one, both beneath the chin and upon it; in others, these parts\r\nare smooth, and the beard is on the cheeks. Those who have smooth chins\r\nare least likely to become bald. The hair grows in some diseases, as\r\nin phthisis especially, and in old age, and upon dead bodies, and the\r\nhair becomes harder instead of softer. The same is the case with the\r\nnails. In persons of strong passions, the hair that is born with them\r\ndecreases, while that which comes after birth increases.\r\n\r\n10. Those who suffer from enlarged veins are less likely to become\r\nbald; and if they have this disease after they are bald, the hair\r\nsometimes grows again. The hair, when cut off, does not grow again from\r\nthe extremity, but increases by growth from the root. The scales of\r\nfishes become harder and thicker, and in those that are growing thin\r\nand old they become still harder. The hair and wool of old animals\r\nbecomes thicker, though the quantity decreases; and the hoofs and claws\r\nenlarge as they grow old, and the beaks of birds. And the claws grow in\r\nthe same way as the nails.\r\n\r\n11. Feathered animals, like birds, do not change their colour by age,\r\nexcepting the crane, for this bird is ash-coloured, and becomes black\r\nby age. But from the change of season, when it becomes cold, some of\r\nthose having but one colour, black or grey, become white, as the crow,\r\nsparrow, and swallow; but none of those which are white become black.\r\nAt different seasons of the year many birds change the colour of their\r\nplumage, so as to render it difficult for those who are not acquainted\r\nwith them to recognise them.\r\n\r\n12. And many animals change their colour with a change of water; for\r\nin one place they are black, and in another white; and the same thing\r\ntakes place at the season of coition. There are many waters of such\r\na nature that if sheep drink of them before sexual intercourse, they\r\nproduce black lambs; as at that which is called the cold river in the\r\nThracian Chalcis (in Astyritis). And in Antandria there are two rivers,\r\none of which turns the sheep white, the other black; and the Scamander\r\nappears to make the sheep yellow, wherefore some people think that\r\nHomer called the Scamander the Xanthus.\r\n\r\n13. Other animals have no hair internally, nor upon the bottom of their\r\nfeet, though it is on the upper part. The hare alone has hair on the\r\ninside of its cheeks, and upon its feet, and the mysticetus[95] has no\r\nteeth in its mouth, but hairs, like hog's bristles. The hair, if it is\r\ncut off, increases below, but not above. Feathers do not grow either\r\nabove or below, but fall out. The wing of the bee, if it is plucked\r\noff, does not grow again, nor that of any other creature which has an\r\nundivided wing; nor does the sting of the bee grow after it is plucked\r\nout, but the animal dies.\r\n\r\n[95] Balæna Mysticetus.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n1. There are membranes in all sanguineous animals. Membrane is\r\nlike a dense thin skin, but it differs in kind, for it is neither\r\ndivisible nor extensible. There is a membrane round every bone and\r\nevery intestine, both in the greater and smaller animals; they are\r\ninconspicuous in small animals, owing to their thinness and small size.\r\nThe principal membranes are two, which surround the brain, one round\r\nthe bones of the head, and this is stronger and thicker than that round\r\nthe brain itself; and after these, the membrane which surrounds the\r\nheart. A thin membrane does not unite after it has been cut asunder,\r\nand the bones, when deprived of their membranes, become inflamed.\r\n\r\n2. The omentum is a membrane. All sanguineous animals have an omentum;\r\nin some it is fat, in others it contains no fat. In viviparous animals,\r\nwith cutting teeth in both jaws, it has its origin and is suspended\r\nfrom the middle of the stomach, where it appears like a suture of this\r\norgan. In those that have not teeth in both jaws, it is suspended in\r\nthe same way from the principal stomach.\r\n\r\n3. The bladder also is membranous, but its character is different, for\r\nit is extensible. All animals have not a bladder, but all viviparous\r\nanimals have this organ, and the tortoise alone of oviparous animals.\r\nWhen the bladder is cut it does not re-unite, except at the very origin\r\nof the urethra, or only very rarely, for it has happened sometimes.\r\nNo moisture passes into the bladder of dead animals; but in living\r\ncreatures there are dry compounds, from which are formed the stones\r\nthat are found in persons labouring under this disease; sometimes\r\nthey are of such a nature in the bladder as to differ in nothing from\r\nshells. This, then, is the nature of veins, sinews, and skins, and of\r\nmuscle and membrane; and of hair, nails, claws, hoofs, horns, teeth and\r\nbeaks, and of cartilage, bone, and their analogues.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n1. In all sanguineous animals, flesh, and that which is like flesh, is\r\nbetween the skin and the bone, or what is analogous to bone: for the\r\nsame relation which a spine bears to a bone, is also borne by flesh to\r\nthat which is like flesh, in animals possessing bones and spines. The\r\nflesh can be divided in every direction, and so is unlike sinews and\r\nveins, which can only be divided in their length. The flesh disappears\r\nin emaciated animals, giving place to veins and fibres. Those animals\r\nwhich can obtain abundance of good food have fat instead of flesh.\r\n\r\n2. Those that have much flesh have smaller veins and redder blood, and\r\ntheir intestines and stomachs are small; but those which have large\r\nveins and dark blood, and large intestines and great stomachs, have\r\nalso less flesh, for those that have fat flesh have small intestines.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n1. Adeps and fat differ from each other, for fat is always brittle, and\r\ncoagulates upon cooling, but adeps is liquid, and does not coagulate;\r\nand broths made from animals with adeps do not thicken, as from the\r\nhorse and hog, but that made from animals with fat thickens, as from\r\nthe sheep and goat. These substances also differ in situation, for the\r\nadeps is between the skin and the flesh; but the fat only exists upon\r\nthe extremity of the flesh. In adipose animals the omentum is adipose,\r\nin fat animals it is fatty: for the animals with cutting teeth in both\r\njaws are adipose, those that have not cutting teeth in both jaws are\r\nfat.\r\n\r\n2. Of the viscera in some animals the liver is full of adeps, as in the\r\ncartilaginous fishes, for oil is procured from these during the process\r\nof decomposition, the cartilaginous fish are particularly free from\r\nadeps on their flesh, but the adeps is separated on the stomach. The\r\nfat also of fishes is adipose, and does not coagulate; and some animals\r\nare furnished with adeps on the flesh, and others apart from the flesh;\r\nand those creatures in which the adeps is not separated from the flesh\r\nhave less of this substance on the stomach and omentum, as the eel: for\r\nthese creatures have little fat on the omentum. In most animals the\r\nadeps collects principally upon the abdomen, especially in those which\r\ntake little exercise.\r\n\r\n3. The brain of adipose animals is unctuous, as in swine; that of fatty\r\nanimals is dry. Of all the viscera the kidneys are surrounded by the\r\ngreatest quantity of adeps in all animals; that on the right side is\r\nalways the least adipose; and let there be ever so much adeps, there is\r\nalways a space left between the kidneys. They are also the most fatty\r\nof the viscera, and especially in sheep, for this animal sometimes\r\ndies from the entire concealment of its kidneys in fat. This excessive\r\nfat around the kidneys arises from good pasture, as in the Leontine\r\nterritory of Sicily; wherefore also in the evening they drive away the\r\nsheep which have been feeding during the day, in order that they may\r\ntake less food.\r\n\r\n4. The fat around the pupil of the eye is common to all animals; for\r\nall have fat in this part, that possess it, and are not hard-eyed. Fat\r\nanimals, both male and female, are more inclined to be barren, and all\r\nold animals become fat more readily than young ones, especially when\r\nthey increase in depth, having obtained their proper width and length.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n1. The following is the nature of the blood. This is most essential and\r\ncommon to all sanguineous animals, and is not superadded, but exists\r\nin all animals that are not in a perishing condition. All the blood is\r\nin a vessel called the veins, but in no other part of the body, except\r\nthe heart. The blood of all animals has no sense of touch, nor has the\r\nexcrementitious matter in the stomach; neither have the brain, nor the\r\nmarrow, any sensation of touch; but wherever the flesh is divided, the\r\nblood flows in the living subject, unless the flesh is perishing. It is\r\nthe nature of the blood to have a sweet juice, as long as it is healthy\r\nand a red colour, and that is bad which either by nature or disease is\r\nblack. The best kind of blood is neither very thick nor thin, unless it\r\nis vitiated either by nature or disease.\r\n\r\n2. In living animals it is always warm and moist, but when taken out\r\nof the animal the blood of all creatures coagulates, except that of\r\nthe stag and deer, and perhaps some others of the same nature. The\r\nblood of all other creatures coagulates, unless the fibre is taken\r\nout of it. Bullock's blood coagulates faster than that of any other\r\nanimals. Amongst sanguineous animals, those which are both internally\r\nand externally viviparous, have the most blood, and after them the\r\noviparous sanguineous animals; those which are well disposed, either by\r\nnature or by health, have not a great deal of blood, as in those that\r\nhave just drank; nor a very little, as in those which are very fat. Fat\r\nanimals have pure blood, though the quantity is small; as they become\r\nmore fat they lose a portion of their blood, for fat is free from\r\nblood. Fat is not corruptible, but blood and the parts that contain\r\nblood are very corruptible; of these the parts surrounding the bones\r\nare most corruptible.\r\n\r\n3. Man has the thinnest and purest blood, that of the ox and ass is the\r\nthickest and blackest of all viviparous animals. The blood is thicker\r\nand blacker in the lower than in the upper part of animals. The blood\r\npalpitates in the veins alike in all animals; this alone of all the\r\nfluids exists in every part of the body of living subjects, and as long\r\nonly as they are alive. The blood first of all exists in the heart of\r\nall animals before it is distributed through the body. When deprived of\r\ntheir blood, or if the greater part escapes, they faint away; but when\r\na very great deal is lost, they die. When the blood becomes very much\r\nliquefied, illness ensues, for it becomes like serum, and flows through\r\nin such a manner, that some have perspired blood; and when taken out\r\nof the body, it does not coagulate into a mass, but into separate and\r\ndivided portions.\r\n\r\n4. In sleeping animals, the blood in the extremities is diminished, so\r\nthat it does not flow freely when they are pricked. Blood is formed\r\nfrom serum, and fat from blood. When the blood becomes diseased,\r\nhæmorrhoids are produced, either in the nose or anus, and a disease\r\ncalled ixia.[96] When the blood becomes corrupted in the body, pus is\r\nformed, and from pus a scab. The blood in females differs from that of\r\nmales, for it is more thick and black in females of similar health and\r\nage. In the whole of the body the quantity of blood is less in females,\r\nbut internally they are more full of blood. Of all females, women have\r\nthe most blood, and the catamenia are more abundant in them than in\r\nother females.\r\n\r\n[96] Varicose veins.\r\n\r\n5. When this blood is diseased, it is called a flooding. Women have a\r\nless share in other diseases; but a few are afflicted with ixia, and\r\nwith hæmorrhoids and bleeding from the nose; when any of these take\r\nplace, the catamenia decrease. The blood differs in proportion to the\r\nage in quantity and appearance, for when very young, it is more like\r\nserum, and very abundant; in the aged it is thick, black, and in less\r\nquantity; in those in the prime of life it is between these. In aged\r\npersons the blood coagulates quickly in the body, or on the surface;\r\nbut in young persons this does not take place. Serum is imperfect\r\nblood, because it has not ripened, or because it has become more fluid.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n1. Concerning marrow, for this is one of the fluids which exist in some\r\nanimals. All the natural fluids of the body are contained in vessels,\r\nas the blood in the veins, and the marrow in the bones, and others in\r\nmembranes, skin, and cavities. The marrow is always full of blood in\r\nyoung animals; but when they grow older, in the adipose it becomes\r\nadipose, in fat animals fatty. There is not marrow in all the bones,\r\nbut only in those that are hollow, and not even in some of these,\r\nfor some of the bones of the lion have no marrow, others but little;\r\nwherefore some persons say the lion has no marrow at all, as was before\r\nobserved. In the bones of swine there is very little marrow, in some\r\nnone at all.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n1. These fluids are nearly always co-existent with animal life; but\r\nmilk and the spermatic fluid are produced afterwards. Of these the\r\nmilk is always secreted in those animals in which it is present. The\r\nspermatic fluid is not secreted in all, but in some as in fishes are\r\nwhat are called melts. All animals having milk have it in the mammæ.\r\nAll animals that are both internally and externally viviparous have\r\nmammæ, that is, all that have hair, as man, and the horse, the cetacea,\r\nas the dolphin, seal, and whale, for these also have mammæ and milk.\r\n\r\n2. Those animals that are only externally viviparous, and oviparous\r\nanimals, have neither mammæ nor milk, as fish, and birds. All milk has\r\na watery serum, which is called whey, and a substantial part called\r\ncurds; the thicker kinds of milk have the most curds. The milk of\r\nanimals without cutting teeth in both jaws, coagulates, wherefore\r\ncheese is made from the milk of domestic animals. The milk of those\r\nwith cutting teeth in both jaws does not coagulate, but resembles their\r\nadeps, and is thin and sweet; the milk of the camel is the thinnest of\r\nall, next is that of the horse; in the third place that of the ass.\r\nCow's milk is thicker.\r\n\r\n3. Under the influence of cold, milk does not coagulate, but becomes\r\nfluid; by heat it is coagulated, and becomes thick. There is no milk\r\nin any animal before it has conceived, or but rarely; but, as soon\r\nas it has conceived the milk is produced; the first and last milk\r\nare useless. Sometimes milk has come in animals not with young, from\r\npartaking of particular kinds of food; and even in aged females it has\r\nbeen produced so freely when sucked, as to afford nourishment for an\r\ninfant. And the shepherds round Æta, when the shegoats will not endure\r\nthe approach of the males, cut their udders violently against a thorn,\r\nso as to cause pain; at first, when milked, they produce bloody, and\r\nafterwards putrid milk, but at last their milk is as good as that of\r\nthose which have young ones.\r\n\r\n4. The males, both of man and other animals, rarely produce milk;\r\nnevertheless, it is found in some cases: for in Lemnos, a he-goat\r\nhas given from the two nipples, which are always found on the penis,\r\nso much milk, that cakes of cheese were made from it. The same thing\r\nhappened to another he-goat, which was produced from this one; but such\r\nthings as these are considered ominous: for, on inquiry being made of\r\nthe god of Lemnos, he replied that there should be an additional supply\r\nof cattle. A small quantity of milk has been forced from some men after\r\npuberty; from others a great quantity has been produced by suction.\r\n\r\n5. There is a fatness in milk which becomes oily when it is cooked.\r\nIn Sicily, and other countries, when there is an abundant supply of\r\ngoat's milk, they mix ewe's milk with it, and it coagulates readily,\r\nnot only because it contains abundance of curd, but also because it\r\nis of a drier nature. Some animals have more milk than enough for the\r\nsupport of their offspring, and this is useful for making cheese, and\r\nfor putting aside. The best is that of the sheep and goats, and next,\r\nthat of the cow. Mare's milk and ass's milk are combined with the\r\nPhrygian cheese. There is more cheese in the milk of the cow than of\r\nthe goat: for the shepherds say, from an amphora of goat's milk they\r\ncan make nineteen cakes of cheese, each worth an obolus, and thirty\r\nfrom cow's milk. Other creatures have only enough for their young, and\r\nno superabundance useful for making cheese, as all those animals which\r\nhave more than two mammæ, for none of these have a superabundance of\r\nmilk, nor will their milk make cheese.\r\n\r\n6. Milk is coagulated by the juice of figs, and by rennet; the juice\r\nis placed upon wool, and the wool is washed in a little milk; this\r\ncoagulates upon mixture. The rennet is a kind of milk, which is found\r\nin the body of sucking animals. This rennet is milk, containing cheese,\r\nfor the milk becomes cooked by the heat of the body. All ruminating\r\nanimals contain rennet, and the hare among those with cutting teeth in\r\nboth jaws. The older coagulum is the better, for such rennet is useful\r\nin diarrhœa, and so is that of the hare. The rennet of the fawn is the\r\nbest.\r\n\r\n7. The greater or less quantity of milk drawn from those animals which\r\nhave milk, differs in the size of the body, and the variety of the\r\nfood. In Phasis there are very small cows, each of which gives a great\r\ndeal of milk; and the large cows of Epirus give an amphora and half of\r\nmilk from each of their two mammæ; and the person who milks them stands\r\nup, or only leans a little, because he cannot reach them sitting down.\r\nThe other animals of Epirus are large except the ass, but the largest\r\nare the cows and the dogs. These large cattle require more pasture; but\r\nthe country has a great deal so excellent, that they can be changed to\r\nfit places every hour. The oxen are the largest, and the sheep, called\r\nPyrrhic; they have received this name from king Pyrrhus.\r\n\r\n8. Some kinds of food check the milk, as the medic grass, especially\r\nin ruminating animals. The cytisus and orobus have a very different\r\neffect; but the flower of the cytisus is unwholesome, and causes\r\ninflammation; the orobus does not agree with pregnant cattle, for it\r\ncauses difficulty of parturition. On the whole, those animals which are\r\nable to eat the most food, as they are better adapted for parturition,\r\nwill also give the most milk, if they have enough food. Some of the\r\nflatulent kinds of food, when given to animals, increase the quantity\r\nof milk, as beans given freely to the sheep, goat, ox, and chimœra,[97]\r\nfor they cause the udder to be distended; and it is a sign that there\r\nwill be plenty of milk when the udder is seen below before parturition.\r\n\r\n[97] Some kind of domestic goat, but not known.\r\n\r\n9. The milk lasts a long time in those that have it, if they remain\r\nwithout sexual intercourse, and have proper food; and in sheep it\r\nlasts longer than in any other animals, for the sheep may be milked\r\nfor eight months. Altogether the ruminating animals produce milk in\r\ngreater abundance, and more fitted for making cheese. Around Torona the\r\ncows fail in their milk a few days before calving, but give milk all\r\nthe rest of the time. In women dark-coloured milk is better for the\r\nchildren than that which is white; and black women are better nurses\r\nthan white women. The most nutritious milk is that which contains the\r\nmost cheese, but that which contains less cheese is better for infants.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n1. All sanguineous animals eject the spermatic fluid; the office it\r\nperforms in generation, and how it is performed, will be treated of in\r\nanother place. In proportion to his size man ejects more than other\r\nanimals. This fluid, in animals covered with hair, is glutinous, in\r\nothers it is not glutinous; in all it is white, so that Herodotus is\r\nmistaken when he says that the Ethiopians have black semen.[98] The\r\nsemen comes out white and thick if it is healthy, but after ejection\r\nit becomes thin and black; it does not thicken with cold, but becomes\r\nthin and watery, both in colour and density. By heat it coagulates and\r\nthickens, and when it has been ejected for any time into the uterus,\r\nit comes out more thick, and sometimes dry and twisted together. That\r\nwhich is fruitful sinks in water, but the barren mixes with it. All\r\nthat Ctesias said about the semen of the elephant is false.\r\n\r\n[98] Herodotus, iii. c. 97, 101.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THE FOURTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n1. We have hitherto treated of sanguineous animals, the parts possessed\r\nby all as well as those which are peculiar to each class, and of\r\ntheir heterogeneous and homogeneous, their external and internal\r\nparts. We are now about to treat of ex-sanguineous animals. There\r\nare many classes of these, first of all the mollusca.[99] These are\r\nex-sanguineous animals, which have their fleshy parts external, and\r\ntheir hard parts internal, like sanguineous animals, as the whole tribe\r\nof cuttle-fish. Next the malacostraca, these are animals which have\r\ntheir hard parts external, and their interior parts soft and fleshy;\r\ntheir hard parts are rather liable to contusion than brittle, as the\r\nclass of carabi and cancri.\r\n\r\n[99] The Cephalopoda.\r\n\r\n2. Another class is that of the testacea. These are animals which have\r\ntheir internal parts fleshy, and their external parts hard, brittle,\r\nand fragile, but not liable to contusion. Snails and oysters are\r\ninstances of this class.\r\n\r\n3. The fourth class is that of insects, which includes many dissimilar\r\nforms. Insects are animals which, as their name signifies, are insected\r\neither in their lower or upper part, or in both; they have neither\r\ndistinct flesh nor bone, but something between both, for their body is\r\nequally hard internally and externally. There are apterous insects,\r\nas the julus and scolopendra; and winged, as the bee, cockchafer, and\r\nwasp; and in some kinds there are both winged and apterous insects;\r\nants, for example, are both winged and apterous, and so is the glowworm.\r\n\r\n4. These are the parts of animals of the class mollusca (malacia);\r\nfirst the feet, as they are called, next to these the head, continuous\r\nwith them; the third part is the abdomen, which contains the viscera.\r\nSome persons, speaking incorrectly, call this the head. The fins are\r\nplaced in a circle round this abdomen. It happens in many of the\r\nmalacia that the head is placed between the feet and the abdomen.\r\n\r\n5. All the polypi, except one kind, have eight feet, with a double row\r\nof suckers. The sepia,[100] teuthis,[101] and teuthos[102] possess as a\r\ncharacteristic part two long proboscidiform members, which have rough\r\nsuckers at their extremities, with which they seize their food and\r\nbring it to their mouth; and when a storm arises they weather it out,\r\nfastening these members upon a rock, like an anchor. They swim by means\r\nof the fin-like members which are attached to the abdomen. There are\r\nsuckers upon all their feet.\r\n\r\n[100] Sepia officinalis.\r\n\r\n[101] Loligo vulgaris (_Owen_).\r\n\r\n[102] Loligo media (_Owen_).\r\n\r\n6. The polypus[103] uses its tentacula both as feet and hands, for it\r\nbrings its food to its mouth with the two that are above the mouth, and\r\nit uses the last of its tentacula, which is the sharpest of all, in the\r\nact of coition; this is the only one which is at all white, and it is\r\ndivided at the extremity, it is placed upon the back; and the smooth\r\npart, in front of which are the acetabula, is called the back. In front\r\nof the abdomen, and above the tentacula, they have a hollow tube,\r\nby which they eject the sea-water which they have received into the\r\nabdomen, if any enters through the mouth. This part varies in position,\r\nand is sometimes on the right side, sometimes on the left, and by this\r\nits ink is ejected.\r\n\r\n[103] Sepia octopodia.\r\n\r\n7. It swims sideways upon the part called the head, stretching out its\r\nfeet; as it swims it is able to see forwards, for the eyes are upwards,\r\nand the mouth is placed behind. As long as it is alive the head is\r\nhard, as if it were inflated; it touches and holds with its tentacula\r\nbent downwards, a membrane is extended throughout, between the feet, if\r\nit falls into the sand, it can no longer hold by it.\r\n\r\n8. The polypus and the above-mentioned malacia differ from each other;\r\nthe abdomen of the polypus is small, and the feet are large; but of\r\nthe others, the abdomen is large, and the feet small, so that they\r\ncannot walk upon them. They have also differences among each other; the\r\nteuthis is the smallest, the sepia wider; the teuthos is much larger\r\nthan the teuthis, for it reaches the length of five cubits. Some sepiæ\r\nare two cubits long, and the tentacula of the polypus are as long, and\r\neven larger in size.\r\n\r\n9. The class of the teuthos is rare, and differs in form from the\r\nteuthis, for the extremity of the teuthos is wider; and, again, the fin\r\nis placed round the whole abdomen, but it is wanting in the teuthis. It\r\nis a marine animal, as well as the teuthis. After the feet, the head of\r\nall these animals is placed in the middle of the feet, which are called\r\ntentacula; one part of this is the mouth, in which are two teeth;\r\nabove these are two large eyes; between these is a small cartilage,\r\ncontaining a small brain.\r\n\r\n10. In the mouth is a small piece of flesh, for these animals have no\r\ntongue, but use this instead of a tongue. After this, on the outside,\r\nthe abdomen is apparent. The flesh of this can be divided, not in a\r\nstraight line, but in a circle. All the malacia have a skin around\r\nthis part. After the mouth, they have a long and narrow œsophagus; and\r\ncontinuous with this is a large round crop, like that of a bird; this\r\ncontains the stomach, like a net. Its form is spiral, like the helix of\r\na whelk; from this a thin intestine turns back, to the vicinity of the\r\nmouth. The intestine is thicker than the stomach.\r\n\r\n11. The malacia have no viscus, except that which is called the\r\nmytis,[104] and the ink which is upon it. The most abundant and largest\r\nof all is that of the sepia; all exclude this ink, when alarmed, but\r\nespecially the sepia; the mytis lies beneath the mouth; and through\r\nthis the œsophagus passes; and where the intestine turns back the\r\nink is beneath, and the same membrane surrounds both the ink and the\r\nintestine. The same orifice serves for the emission of the ink and the\r\nfœces.\r\n\r\n[104] Köhler supposes the part called by Aristotle _mytis_ to have\r\nbeen the glandular appendages on the vena cava and two visceral veins.\r\n(_Owen in Todd's Cyclopedia of Anatomy, Art. Cephalopoda._)\r\n\r\n12. There are some appearances of hair[105] in their bodies; the sepia,\r\nteuthis, and teuthos, have a hard part upon the forward part of the\r\nbody; the one is called sepium (the bone of the cuttle-fish), the other\r\nxiphus (the pen of the loligo). These two are different; for that of\r\nthe sepia is strong and wide, partaking of the nature of spine and\r\nbone, and it contains a spongy, friable substance; but the pen of the\r\nteuthis is thin, and cartilaginous. In their form also they correspond\r\nwith the differences of the animals themselves. The polypus has no\r\nhard internal part, but a portion of cartilage round the head, which\r\nbecomes hard as they grow old.\r\n\r\n[105] Probably the branchia.\r\n\r\n13. The females also differ from the males, for the latter have a\r\npassage beneath the œsophagus, extending from the brain to the lowest\r\npart of the body. That part to which it reaches is like a teat. In\r\nthe female there are two such organs, which are placed above. In both\r\nsexes, some small red bodies are placed under these. The polypus has\r\none capsule of eggs, which is uneven on the surface; it is large;\r\ninternally it is all of a white colour, and smooth. The multitude of\r\nthe ova is so great as to fill a vessel larger than the head of the\r\npolypus.\r\n\r\n14. The sepia has two capsules, and many eggs are in them, like\r\nwhite hailstones. The position of each of these parts may be seen in\r\nanatomical diagrams. In all these creatures the male differs from the\r\nfemale, and especially in the sepia. The fore part of the abdomen of\r\nthe male is always darker than the back; and more rough than in the\r\nfemale, and variegated with stripes, and the extremity of the body is\r\nmore acute.\r\n\r\n15. There are many kinds of polypus; one, which is the largest of\r\nall, is very common. Those near land are larger than those which are\r\ncaught out at sea. There are smaller kinds, which are variegated;\r\nthese are not articles of food; and two others, one of which is called\r\neledone,[106] differs in the length of its feet, and is the only one of\r\nthe malacia with a single row of suckers, for all the rest have two;\r\nthe other is called bolitæna,[107] and sometimes ozolis.\r\n\r\n[106] Eledone moschata.--_Leach._ (_Owen._)\r\n\r\n[107] Eledone cirrosa.--_Leach._ (_Owen._)\r\n\r\n16. There are two other kinds which dwell in shells, which some persons\r\ncall nautilus[108] (and nauticus), and others call it the egg of the\r\npolypus; its shell is like that of the hollow pecten, and not like\r\nthat which has its shells close together.[109] This animal generally\r\nfeeds near the land; when it is thrown upon the shore by the waves,\r\nafter its shell has fallen off, it cannot escape, and dies upon the\r\nland. These animals are small in form, like the bolitæna; and there is\r\nanother,[110] which inhabits a shell like a snail. This animal never\r\nleaves its shell, but remains in it, like the snail, and sometimes\r\nstretches out its tentacula. Let thus much be said about the malacia.\r\n\r\n[108] Argonauta argo. (_Owen._)\r\n\r\n[109] This is probably the meaning of the passage. Two kinds of pectens\r\nwere distinguished; the one large, hollow, and of a dark colour, the\r\nother broad and sweeter, but harsh.\r\n\r\n[110] Nautilus Pompilius (_Owen._)\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n1. Of the malocostraca, there is one genus, of carabi,[111] and\r\nanother, very like it, of astaci;[112] these differ from the carabi,\r\nwhich have no claws, and in some other respects. There is a third\r\ngenus, of carides,[113] and a fourth, of carcini.[114] There are more\r\ngenera of carides, and of carcini; for among the carides are the\r\ncyphæ,[115] the crangon,[116] and a small species, for these never grow\r\nlarge.\r\n\r\n[111] Palinurus, spiny lobster (Bell's crustacea).\r\n\r\n[112] Lobster.\r\n\r\n[113] Prawns.\r\n\r\n[114] Crabs.\r\n\r\n[115] Shrimp.\r\n\r\n[116] Perhaps Prawn.\r\n\r\n2. The family of carcini is more various, and not so easily enumerated;\r\nthe largest genus is that called maia,[117] the next to this the\r\npagurus,[118] and the Heracleot carcini; and, again, those that live\r\nin rivers. The other genera are small, and have not received any name.\r\nOn the Phenician coast there are some that they call horsemen, because\r\nthey run so fast that it is difficult to catch them, and when opened,\r\nthey are empty, because they have no pasture. There is another small\r\ngenus like carcini, but in shape they resemble astaci.\r\n\r\n[117] Perhaps Maia squinado.\r\n\r\n[118] Cancer paguras, Great crab.\r\n\r\n3. All these creatures, as I observed before, have their hard and\r\nshelly coats on the outsides of their bodies in the place of skin, the\r\nfleshy part is internal. Their under parts resemble plates, upon which\r\nthe females deposit their ova; the carabi have five feet on each side,\r\nincluding the claws; the carcini, also, have in all ten feet, including\r\nthe claws, which are last. Of the carides, the cypha have five on each\r\nside; those near the head are sharp, and five others on each side of\r\nthe stomach have flat extremities; they have no plates upon the under\r\npart of their body; those on the upper part are like the carabi.\r\n\r\n4. The crangon is different, for it has, first of all, four plates on\r\neach side, and, afterwards, three slight ones, continuous with those\r\non each side, and the greater part of the remainder of its body is\r\napodal; all the feet are directed outwards to the side, like those of\r\ninsects; but the claws, in those that have them, all turned inwards.\r\nThe carabus also has a tail, and five fin-like appendages. The cypha,\r\namong the carides, has a tail, with four fin-like appendages. The\r\ncrangon has fin-like processes on each side of the tail, and the middle\r\nof them is spinous on both sides; but this part is wide in the crangon,\r\nand sharp in the cypha. The carcini alone are without a tail; the body\r\nof the carabi and carides is elongated, that of the carcini is rounded.\r\n\r\n5. The male carabus is different from the female, for the female has\r\nthe first foot divided; in the male it is formed of a single claw, and\r\nthe fin-like process on the lower part is large in the female, and\r\ninterchanged with each other in the neck; in the male they are small\r\nand not interchanged. In the male, also, the last feet are furnished\r\nwith large and sharp processes like spurs; in the female these are\r\nsmall and smooth. They all have two large and rough processes, like\r\nhorns, before their eyes, and two, smaller and smooth, below.\r\n\r\n6. The eyes of all these animals are hard, and capable of motion,\r\ninwards, outwards, and to the side; the same is the nature of the\r\ncarcini, in which they are even more moveable. In colour the astacus\r\nis all of a dull white, sprinkled with black; it has eight small feet,\r\nas far as the large ones; after these the large feet are far greater\r\nand wider at the extremity than in the carabus, and they are unequal\r\nin size; for on the right side the broad part at the end is long and\r\nsmooth, on the left side the same part is thick and round; they are\r\nboth divided from the extremity like a jaw, with teeth above and below,\r\nonly that in those on the right the teeth are all small and sharp, and\r\nthey are sharp at the extremity of the left side; in the middle they\r\nare like molar teeth; in the lower part are four close together, but in\r\nthe upper part three, but not close together.\r\n\r\n7. In both claws the upper part is moved and pressed down upon the\r\nlower; both are placed sideways in position, as if intended by nature\r\nfor seizure and pressure; above these large feet are two rough ones, a\r\nlittle below the mouth; and still lower, the branchial organs around\r\nthe mouth, which are rough and numerous, and these are continually in\r\nmotion; it bends and approximates its two rough feet towards its mouth;\r\nthe feet near the mouth have smooth appendages.\r\n\r\n8. It has two teeth like the carabus, above these the long horns,\r\nmuch shorter and smoother than in the carabus; four others of the same\r\nform as these, but still shorter and smoother; and above these are\r\nplaced its eyes, which are small and short, and not large like those\r\nof the carabus. The part above the eyes is acute and rough, as it were\r\na forehead, and larger than in the carabus: on the whole, the head is\r\nsharper and the thorax much wider than in the carabus, and its whole\r\nbody is more fleshy and soft: of its right feet, four are divided at\r\nthe extremity, and four not divided.\r\n\r\n9. The part called the neck is externally divided into five portions,\r\nthe sixth and last division is wide and has five plates; in the inside\r\nare four rough plates, upon which the females deposit their ova. On\r\nthe outside of each of these which have been mentioned, there is a\r\nshort and straight spine, and the whole body, with the part called the\r\nthorax, is smooth, and not rough as in the carabus. On the outside of\r\nthe large feet there are great spines. The female does not in any way\r\ndiffer from the male, for whether the male or female have larger claws,\r\nthey are never both of them equal.\r\n\r\n10. All these animals take in sea-water through their mouths; the\r\ncarcini also exhale a small portion of that which they have taken in,\r\nand the carabi do this through the branchiform appendages, for the\r\ncarabi have many branchiform appendages. All these animals have two\r\nteeth: the carabi have two front teeth, and then a fleshy mouth instead\r\nof a tongue, from this an œsophagus continued on to the stomach. And\r\nthe carabi have a small œsophagus before the stomach, and from this\r\na straight intestine is continued. In the caraboid animals and the\r\ncarides, this is continued to the tail in a straight passage, by which\r\nthey eject their excrements, and deposit their ova. In the carcini this\r\nis in the middle of the folded part, for the place wherein they deposit\r\ntheir ova is external in these also.\r\n\r\n11. All the females also, besides the intestines, have a place for\r\ntheir ova, and the part called mytis[119] or mecon, which is greater\r\nor less, and the peculiar differences may be learned by studying the\r\nindividual cases. The carabi, as I have observed, have two large and\r\nhollow teeth, in which there is a juice resembling the mytis, and,\r\nbetween the teeth, a piece of flesh resembling a tongue; from the mouth\r\na short œsophagus extends to a membranous stomach; in the part of this\r\nnearest the mouth are three teeth, two opposite and one below.\r\n\r\n[119] Perhaps the liver.\r\n\r\n12. And from the side of the stomach there is a simple intestine, which\r\nis of equal thickness throughout, reaching to the anus. All these parts\r\nbelong to the carabi, carides, and carcini; and, besides these, the\r\ncarabi have a passage suspended from the breast and reaching to the\r\nanus; in the female this performs the office of a uterus, in the male\r\nit contains the spermatic fluid. This passage is in the cavity of the\r\nflesh, so as to appear to be between portions of the flesh, for the\r\nintestine is toward the curved part, but the passage towards the cavity\r\nin the same way as in quadrupeds. In the male this part differs in\r\nnothing from the female, for both are smooth and white, and contain an\r\nochreous fluid, and in both sexes it is appended to the breast.\r\n\r\n13. The ova and spirals occupy the same position in the carides. The\r\nmale is distinguished from the female by having in the flesh upon the\r\nbreast two distinct white bodies, in colour and position like the\r\ntentacula of the sepia; these appendages are spiriform, like the mecon\r\nof the whelk; their origin is from the acetabula, which are placed\r\nunder the last feet. These contain a red sanguineous flesh, which is\r\nsmooth to the touch, and not like flesh. From the whelk-like appendage\r\nthere is another spiral fold, about as thick as a thread, below which\r\nthere are two sand-like bodies appended to the intestine, containing a\r\nseminal fluid. These are found in the male, but the female has ova of\r\na red colour; these are joined to the abdomen, and on each side of the\r\nintestine to the fleshy part of the body, enclosed in a thin membrane.\r\nThese are their internal and external parts.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n1. It happens that all the internal parts of sanguineous animals have\r\nnames, for all these have the internal viscera; but the same parts of\r\nexsanguineous animals have no names, but both classes have in common\r\nthe stomach, œsophagus, and intestines. I have before spoken of the\r\ncarcini, and their legs and feet, and how many they have, and in what\r\ndirection, and that, for the most part, they have the right claw larger\r\nand stronger than the left; I have also mentioned their eyes, and\r\nthat most of them are able to see sideways. The mass of their body is\r\nundivided, and so is their head, and any other part.\r\n\r\n2. In some the eyes are placed immediately below the upper part, and\r\ngenerally far apart; in some they are placed in the middle, and near\r\ntogether, as in the Heracleot carcini and the maia. The mouth is placed\r\nbelow the eyes, and contains two teeth, as in the carabus, but they are\r\nlong and not round, and over these there are two coverings, between\r\nwhich are the appendages, which the carabus also possesses.\r\n\r\n3. They receive water through their mouth, opening the opercula, and\r\nemit it again by the upper passage of the mouth, closing the opercula\r\nby which it entered; these are immediately beneath the eyes, and when\r\nthey take in water they close the mouth with both opercula, and thus\r\neject again the sea-water. Next to the teeth is a very short œsophagus,\r\nso that the mouth appears joined to the stomach, and from this proceeds\r\na divided stomach, from the middle of which is a single thin intestine;\r\nthis intestine ends externally beneath the folding of the extremity,\r\nas I said before. Between the opercula there is something resembling\r\nthe appendages to the teeth of the carabi; within the abdomen is an\r\nochreous chyme, and some small elongated white bodies, and other red\r\nones scattered through it. The male differs from the female in length\r\nand width, and in the abdominal covering, for this is longer in the\r\nfemale, farther from the body, and more thick-set with appendages, as\r\nin the female carabi. The parts of the malacostraca are of this nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n1. The testacea, as cochleæ,[120] and cochli,[121] and all that are\r\ncalled ostrea,[122] and the family of echini, are composed of flesh,\r\nand this flesh is like that of the malacostraci, for it is internal;\r\nbut the shell is external, and they have no hard internal part. But\r\nthey have many differences amongst themselves, both in regard to their\r\nexternal shells and their internal flesh, for some of them have no\r\nflesh at all, as the echinus; in others it is entirely internal and\r\nout of sight, except the head, as the land snails and those called\r\ncoccalia,[123] and in the sea the purpura[124] and the ceryx,[125] the\r\ncochlus, and all the turbinated shells.\r\n\r\n[120] Land snails.\r\n\r\n[121] Marine.\r\n\r\n[122] Bivalves.\r\n\r\n[123] Some small land snail with a conical shell.\r\n\r\n[124] Purpura.\r\n\r\n[125] Whelk.\r\n\r\n2. Of the rest some are bivalves, others univalves. I call those\r\nbivalves which are enclosed in two shells; the univalves are enclosed\r\nin one shell, and the fleshy part is uncovered, as the lepas.[126]\r\nSome of the bivalves can open, as the pectens and mya, for all these\r\nare joined on one side, and separated on the other, so as to shut and\r\nopen. There are other bivalves which are joined on both sides, as the\r\nsolen; others which are entirely enclosed in their shells, and have no\r\nexternal naked flesh, as those which are called tethya.[127]\r\n\r\n[126] Patella, limpet.\r\n\r\n[127] Ascidians.\r\n\r\n3. And there is a great difference amongst the shells themselves, for\r\nsome are smooth, as the solen, mya, and some conchæ, called by some\r\npersons galaces;[128] other shells are rough, as the limnostrea,[129]\r\npinnæ, some kinds of conchæ, and the whelk; and of these some are\r\nmarked with ridges, as the pecten and a kind of concha, others are\r\nwithout ridges, as the pinna and another species of concha. They also\r\ndiffer in thickness and thinness, both in the whole shell and in\r\ncertain parts of the shell, as about the edges, for in some the edges\r\nare thin, as the mya; others are thick-edged, as the limnostrea.\r\n\r\n[128] Chama, L.\r\n\r\n[129] Ostrea edulis.\r\n\r\n4. Some of them are capable of motion, as the pecten, for some persons\r\nsay that the pectens can fly, for that they sometimes leap out of the\r\ninstrument by which they are taken. Others, as the pinna, cannot move\r\nfrom the point of attachment; all the turbinated shells can move and\r\ncrawl; the lepas (patella) also feeds by going from place to place.\r\nIt is common to all those with hard shells to have them smooth in the\r\ninside.\r\n\r\n5. Both in univalves and bivalves the fleshy part is united to the\r\nshell, so that it can only be separated by force; it is more easily\r\nseparated from the turbinated shells; it is a characteristic of all\r\nthese shells, that the base of the shell has the helix directed from\r\nthe head. All of them from their birth have an operculum; all the\r\nturbinated testacea are right-handed, and move, not in the direction\r\nof the helix, but the contrary way.\r\n\r\n6. The external parts of these creatures are thus distinguished; the\r\nnature of their internal structure is similar in all, especially in\r\nthe turbinated animals, for they differ in size and in the relations\r\nof excess, the univalves and bivalves do not exhibit many differences.\r\nMost of them have but few distinctive marks from each other, but they\r\ndiffer more from the immovable creatures. This will be more evident\r\nfrom the following considerations. In nature they are all alike, the\r\ndifference, as before said, is in excess; for in larger species the\r\nparts are more conspicuous, and less so in those that are smaller. They\r\ndiffer also in hardness and softness, and such like affections.\r\n\r\n7. For all have on the outside of the shell, in the mouth, a hard piece\r\nof flesh, some more, some less; from the middle of this are the head\r\nand the two horns; these are large in larger species, in the little\r\nones they are very small. The head is protruded in the same manner in\r\nall of them, and when the creature is alarmed it is again retracted;\r\nsome have a mouth and teeth, as the snail, which has small, sharp, and\r\nsmooth teeth.\r\n\r\n8. They have also a proboscis, like that of the fly, and this organ is\r\nlike a tongue. In the ceryx and the purpura this organ is hard, like\r\nthat of the myops and œstrus, with which they pierce through the skins\r\nof quadrupeds; but this is more powerful in strength, for they can\r\npierce through the shells of the baits. The stomach is joined quite\r\nclosely to the mouth; the stomach of the cochlus is like the crop of\r\na bird; below this there are two hard white substances like nipples,\r\nwhich also exist in the sepia, but are much harder.\r\n\r\n9. From the stomach a long, simple intestine reaches as far as the\r\nspiral, which is on the extremity of the body. These are distinct, and\r\nin the purpura and the ceryx are in the helix of the shell. The bowel\r\nis continuous with the intestine. The intestine and bowels are joined\r\ntogether, and are quite simple, to the anus. The origin of the bowel is\r\naround the helix of the mecon,[130] and here it is wider. The mecon is,\r\nas it were, a superfluous part in all testacea, afterwards another bend\r\ncauses it to return to the fleshy part; the end of the entrail, where\r\nthe fæces are emitted, is near the head, and is alike in all turbinated\r\nshells, whether terrestrial or marine.\r\n\r\n[130] The so-called liver (_Strack_). Papaver (_Scaliger_).\r\n\r\n10. In the larger cochli a long white passage, contained in a membrane,\r\nand in colour resembling the upper mastoid appendages, is joined from\r\nthe stomach to the œsophagus, and it is divided into segments like\r\nthe ovum of the carabus, except that it is white, while the other is\r\nred. It has neither exit nor passage, but it is contained in a thin\r\nmembrane, which has a narrow cavity. From the intestine black and rough\r\nbodies descend continuously, like those in the tortoise, but they are\r\nless black.\r\n\r\n11. Both these and white bodies occur in the marine cochli, but they\r\nare less in the smaller kinds. The univalves and bivalves are in some\r\nrespects like these, and in others they are different, for they have a\r\nhead, horns, and mouth, and something like a tongue, though in smaller\r\nspecies these are inconspicuous from their minute size, and they are\r\nnot discernible when the animals are dead or at rest. They all contain\r\nthe mecon, but not in the same position, nor of the same size, nor\r\nequally conspicuous. In the lepas it is in the bottom of the shell, in\r\nthe bivalves near the hinge.\r\n\r\n12. They all have hair-like appendages placed in a circle, and so have\r\nthe pectens, and that which is called the ovarium in those that have\r\nit; where it is possessed, it is placed in a circle on the other side\r\nof the circumference, like the white portion in the cochli, for this is\r\nalike in all. All these parts, as I have said, are conspicuous in the\r\nlarger kinds, but in smaller not at all, or scarcely so, wherefore they\r\nare most conspicuous in the larger pectens, and these have one valve\r\nflat like an operculum.\r\n\r\n13. The anus is placed in the side in some of these creatures, for this\r\nis where the excrement passes out. The mecon, as I have said, is a\r\nsuperfluous part enclosed in a thin membrane in all of them; that which\r\nis called the ovarium has no passage in any of them, but it swells out\r\nin the flesh. This is not placed upon the intestine, for the ovarium\r\nis on the right side and the intestine on the left; the anus is the\r\nsame as in others; but in the wild patella, as some persons call it, or\r\nthe sea-ear (haliotis), as it is named by others, the excrement passes\r\nout below the shell, for the shell is perforated. The stomach also is\r\ndistinct behind the mouth, and so is the ovarium in this animal. The\r\nposition of all these parts may be seen in dissections.\r\n\r\n14. The creature called carcinium[131] resembles both the malacostraca\r\nand the testacea, for this in its nature is similar to the animals that\r\nare like carabi, and it is born naked (not covered with a shell). But\r\nbecause it makes its way into a shell, and lives in it, it resembles\r\nthe testacea, and for these reasons it partakes of the character of\r\nboth classes. Its shape, to speak plainly, is that of a spider, except\r\nthat the lower part of the head and thorax is larger.\r\n\r\n[131] Hermit crab.\r\n\r\n15. It has two thin red horns, and two large eyes below these, not\r\nwithin nor turned on one side, like those of the crab, but straight\r\nforwards. Below these is the mouth, and round it many hair-like\r\nappendages; next to these, two divided feet with which it seizes its\r\nprey, and two besides these on each side, and a third pair smaller.\r\nBelow the thorax the whole creature is soft, and when laid open is\r\nyellow within.\r\n\r\n16. From the mouth is a passage as far as the stomach; but the anus is\r\nindistinct; the feet and the thorax are hard, but less so than those\r\nof the cancri; it is not united with the shell like the purpura and\r\nceryx, but is easily liberated from it. The individuals which inhabit\r\nthe shells of the strombus are longer than those in the shells of the\r\nnerita.\r\n\r\n17. The kind which inhabits the nerita is different, though very like\r\nin other respects, for the right divided foot is small, and the left\r\none large, and it walks more upon this than the other; and a similar\r\nanimal is found in the conchæ, though they are united to their shells\r\nvery firmly; this animal is called cyllarus.[132] The nerita has a\r\nsmooth, large, round shell, in form resembling that of the ceryx, but\r\nthe mecon is not black, but red; it is strongly united in the middle.\r\n\r\n[132] Cancer Diogenes.\r\n\r\n18. In fine weather they seek their food at liberty, and if a storm\r\narises, the carcinia hide themselves under a stone, and the neritæ\r\nattach themselves to it like the patella, the hæmorrhois, and all that\r\nclass, for they become attached to the rock, where they close their\r\noperculum, for this resembles a lid; for that part which is in both\r\nsides in the bivalves is joined to one side in the turbinated shells:\r\nthe interior is fleshy, and in this the mouth is placed.\r\n\r\n19. The nature of the hæmorrhois, the purpura, and all such animals is\r\nthe same. But those which have the left foot greater are not found in\r\nthe shells of the strombus, but in the neritæ. There are some cochli\r\nwhich contain an animal like the small astacus, which is found in\r\nrivers; but they differ from them in having the inner part of the shell\r\nsoft. Their form may be seen by examining dissections.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n1. The echini contain no flesh, but this part is peculiar, for they are\r\nall of them void of flesh, and are filled with a black substance. There\r\nare many kinds of echinus, one of which is eatable; in this one the ova\r\nare large and eatable, both in the greater and the less.\r\n\r\n2. And there are two other kinds, the spatangus and that called\r\nbryttus; these are inhabitants of the sea, and rare. Those which are\r\ncalled echinometræ[133] are the largest of all. Besides this, there\r\nis another small species, which has long and sharp spines; this is\r\nprocured from the sea, in many fathoms water, and some persons use it\r\nfor stranguary.\r\n\r\n[133] Echinus esculentus.\r\n\r\n3. Around Torona there are white marine echini, which have shells,\r\nand prickles, and ova, and are longer than others; but the prickle is\r\nneither large nor strong, but soft, and the black parts from the mouth\r\nare more in number, and united to the outward passage, but distinct\r\namong themselves, and by these the animal is as it were divided. The\r\neatable kinds are particularly and especially active, and it is a sign\r\nof them; for they have always something adhering to their spines.\r\n\r\n4. They all contain ova, but in some they are very small, and not\r\neatable: that which is called the head and mouth in the echinus is\r\ndownwards, and the anus placed upwards. The same thing occurs in the\r\nturbinated shells, and the patella; for their food is placed below\r\nthem, so that the mouth is towards the food, and the anus at or on the\r\nupper part of the shell.\r\n\r\n5. The echinus has five hollow internal teeth, in the midst of these a\r\nportion of flesh like a tongue; next to this is the œsophagus; then the\r\nstomach, in five divisions, full of fæculent matter: all its cavities\r\nunite in one, near the anus, where the shell is perforated. Beneath the\r\nstomach, in another membrane, are the ova, the same number in all,\r\nthey are five in number, and uneven.\r\n\r\n6. The black substance is joined above to the origin of the teeth, this\r\nblack substance is bitter and not eatable; in many animals there is\r\neither this substance or its analogue, for it is found in tortoises,\r\ntoads, frogs, turbinated shells, and in the malacia; these parts differ\r\nin colour, but are entirely or nearly uneatable. The body of the\r\nechinus is undivided from beginning to end, but the shell is not so\r\nwhen seen through, for it is like a lantern, with no skin around it.\r\nThe echinus uses its spines as feet, for it moves along by leaning upon\r\nthem and moving them.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n1. The creatures called tethya[134] have a most distinct character,\r\nfor in these alone is the whole body concealed in a shell. Their shell\r\nis intermediate between skin and shell, so that it can be cut like\r\nhard leather: this shell-like substance is attached to rocks; in it\r\nthere are two perforations, quite distant from each other, and not\r\neasily seen, by which it excludes and receives water, for it has no\r\nvisible excrement as other testacea, neither like the echinus, nor the\r\nsubstance called mecon.\r\n\r\n[134] Ascidian mollusks.\r\n\r\n2. When laid open, there is first of all a sinewy membrane lining the\r\nshell-like substance, within this the fleshy substance of the tethyon.\r\nUnlike any other creature, its flesh, however, is alike throughout, and\r\nit is united in two places to the membrane and the skin from the side,\r\nand at its points of union it is narrower on each side; by these places\r\nit reaches to the external perforations which pass through the shell;\r\nthere it both parts with and receives food and moisture, as if one were\r\nthe mouth, the other the anus, the one is thick, the other thinner.\r\n\r\n3. Internally there is a cavity at each end, and a passage passes\r\nthrough it; there is a fluid in both the cavities. Besides this, it\r\nhas no sensitive or organic member, nor is there any excrementitious\r\nmatter, as I said before. The colour of the tethyon is partly ochreous,\r\npartly red.\r\n\r\n4. The class acalephe[135] is peculiar; it adheres to rocks like some\r\nof the testacea, but at times it is washed off. It is not covered with\r\na shell, but its whole body is fleshy; it is sensitive, and seizes upon\r\nthe hand that touches it, and it holds fast, like the polypus does\r\nwith its tentacula, so as to make the flesh swell up. It has a central\r\nmouth, and lives upon the rock, as well as upon shell-fish, and if any\r\nsmall fish falls in its way, it lays hold of it as with a hand, and if\r\nany eatable thing falls in its way it devours it.\r\n\r\n[135] Actiniæ.\r\n\r\n5. One species is free, and feeds upon anything it meets with, even\r\npectens and echini; it appears to have no visible excrement, and in\r\nthis respect it resembles plants. There are two kinds of acalephe, some\r\nsmall and more eatable, others large and hard, such as are found near\r\nChalcis. During winter their flesh is compact, wherefore in this season\r\nthey are caught and eaten; in summer time they perish, for they become\r\nsoft; if they are touched they soon melt down, and cannot by any means\r\nbe taken away. When suffering from heat, they prefer getting under\r\nstones. I have now treated of malacia, malacostraca, testacea, and of\r\ntheir external and internal parts.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n1. Insects must now be treated of in the same manner. This is a class\r\nwhich contains many forms, and no common name has been given to unite\r\nthose that are naturally related, as the bee, anthrene,[136] and wasp,\r\nand such like; again, those which have their wings enclosed in a case,\r\nas the melolontha,[137] carabus,[138] cantharis, and such like. The\r\ncommon parts of all insects are three--the head, the abdomen, and the\r\nthird, which is between these, such as in other animals is the breast\r\nand back. In many insects this is one, but in the long insects with\r\nmany legs, the middle parts are equal to the number of segments.\r\n\r\n[136] Wild bee.\r\n\r\n[137] Chafer.\r\n\r\n[138] Beetle.\r\n\r\n2. All insects survive being divided, except those which are naturally\r\ncold, or soon become so from their small size, so that wasps live\r\nafter they are cut asunder; either the head or the abdomen will live\r\nif united to the thorax, but the head will not live alone. Those which\r\nare long, and have many feet, will survive division for a considerable\r\ntime; both the extremities are capable of motion, for they walk both\r\nupon the part cut off and upon the tail, as that which is called\r\nscolopendra. All of them have eyes, but no other manifest organs of\r\nsense, except that some have a tongue. All the testacea have this\r\norgan, which serves the double purpose of tasting and drawing food into\r\nthe mouth.\r\n\r\n3. In some of them this organ is soft; in others very strong, as in the\r\npurpura; in the myops and œstrus this member is strong, and in a great\r\nmany more; for this member is used as a weapon by all those that have\r\nno caudal sting.\r\n\r\n4. Those with this weapon have no small external teeth, for flies\r\ndraw blood by touching with this organ, and gnats sting with it. Some\r\ninsects also have stings, which are either internal, as in bees and\r\nwasps, or external, as in the scorpion. This last is the only insect\r\nthat has a long tail; it has claws, and so has the little scorpion-like\r\ncreature[139] found in books. The winged insects, in addition to other\r\nparts, have wings. Some have two wings, as the flies; others four, as\r\nthe bees; none of the diptera have a caudal sting. Some of the winged\r\ninsects have elytra on their wings, as the melolontha; and others no\r\nelytra, as the bee. Insects do not direct their flight with their tail,\r\nand their wings have neither shaft nor division.\r\n\r\n[139] Phalangium Cancroides. _Linn. Schneider._\r\n\r\n5. Some have a horn before their eyes, as the psychæ[140] and carabi.\r\nOf the jumping insects, some have their hind-legs larger; others have\r\nthe organs of jumping bent backwards, like the legs of quadrupeds. In\r\nall, the upper part is different from the lower, like other animals.\r\n\r\n[140] Butterfly.\r\n\r\n6. The flesh of their bodies is neither testaceous nor like the\r\ninternal parts of testacea, but between the two. Wherefore, also, they\r\nhave neither spine nor bone, as the sepia; nor are they surrounded\r\nwith a shell. For the body is its own protection by its hardness, and\r\nrequires no other support; and they have a very thin skin. This is the\r\nnature of their external parts.\r\n\r\n7. Internally, immediately after the mouth, there is an intestine\r\nwhich in most insects passes straight and simply to the anus, in a few\r\nit is convoluted; these have no bones nor fat, neither has any other\r\nexsanguineous animal. Some have a stomach, and from this the remainder\r\nof the intestine is either simple or convoluted, as in the acris.[141]\r\nThe tettix (grasshopper) alone of this, or any other class of living\r\ncreatures, has no mouth; but, like those with a caudal sting, it has\r\nthe appearance of a tongue, long, continuous, and undivided, and with\r\nthis it feeds upon the dew alone. There is no excrement in the stomach.\r\nThere are many kinds of these creatures, they differ in being greater\r\nor less; those called achetae are divided beneath the diaphragm, and\r\nhave a conspicuous membrane, which the tettigonia has not.\r\n\r\n[141] Locust.\r\n\r\n8. There are many other creatures in the sea which it is not possible\r\nto arrange in any class from their scarcity. For some experienced\r\nfishermen say they have seen in the sea creatures like small beams,\r\nblack and round, and of the same thickness throughout; others like\r\nshields, of a red colour, with many fins; others[142] like the human\r\npenis in appearance and size, but instead of testicles they had two\r\nfins, and that such have been taken on the extremity of grappling\r\nirons. This is the nature of the internal and external parts of all\r\nanimals of every kind, both those which are peculiar to certain\r\nspecies, and those which are common to all.\r\n\r\n[142] Perhaps Pennatula.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n1. We must now treat of the Senses: for they are not alike in all,\r\nbut some have all the senses, and some fewer. They are mostly five in\r\nnumber; seeing, hearing, smelling, taste, touch, and besides these\r\nthere are none peculiar to any creatures. Man, then, and all viviparous\r\nanimals with feet, besides all sanguineous and viviparous animals, have\r\nall these, unless they are undeveloped in any particular kind, as in\r\nthe mole.\r\n\r\n2. For this creature has no sight, it has no apparent eyes, but when\r\nthe thick skin which surrounds the head is taken away, in the place\r\nwhere the eyes ought to be on the outside, are the undeveloped internal\r\neyes, which have all the parts of true eyes, for they have both the\r\niris of the eye, and within the iris the part called the pupil, and the\r\nwhite; but all these are less than in true eyes. On the outside there\r\nis no appearance of these parts, from the thickness of the skin, as if\r\nthe nature of the eye had been destroyed at birth; for there are two\r\nsinewy and strong passages proceeding from the brain, where it unites\r\nwith the spinal cord, reaching from the socket of the eye, and ending\r\nupon the upper sharp teeth.\r\n\r\n3. All other animals are endued with the perception of colours, sounds,\r\nsmells, and taste. All animals have the fifth sense, which is called\r\ntouch. In some animals the organs of sense are very distinct, and\r\nespecially the eyes, for they have a definite place, and so has the\r\nhearing. For some animals have ears, and others open perforations:\r\nso also of the sense of smelling, some animals have nostrils, others\r\npassages, as the whole class of birds. In the same way the tongue is\r\nthe organ of taste.\r\n\r\n4. In aquatic animals and those called fish, the tongue is still\r\nthe organ of taste, though it is indistinct, for it is bony, and\r\nnot capable of free motion. In some fish the roof of the mouth is\r\nfleshy, as in some cyprini among river fish, so that, without careful\r\nexamination, it appears like a tongue. That they have the sense of\r\ntaste is quite clear, for many of them delight in peculiar food, and\r\nthey will more readily seize upon a bait formed of the amia and other\r\nfat fishes, as if they delighted in the taste and eating of such baits.\r\n\r\n5. They have no evident organ of hearing and smelling, for the passages\r\nwhich exist about the region of the nostrils in some fish do not appear\r\nto pass to the brain, but some of them are blind, and others lead to\r\nthe gills; it is evident, however, that they both hear and smell, for\r\nthey escape from loud noises, such as the oars of the triremes, so as\r\nto be easily captured in their hiding-places.\r\n\r\n6. For if the external noise is not loud, yet to all aquatic animals\r\nthat are capable of hearing, it appears harsh and very loud; and this\r\ntakes place in hunting dolphins, for when they have enclosed them with\r\ntheir canoes, they make a noise from them in the sea, and the dolphins,\r\ncrowded together, are obliged to leap upon the land, and, being stunned\r\nwith the noise, are easily captured, although even dolphins have no\r\nexternal organs of hearing.\r\n\r\n7. And again in fishing, the fishermen are careful to avoid making a\r\nnoise with their oars or net when they perceive many fish collected in\r\none place; they make a signal, and let down their nets in such a place\r\nthat no sound of the oar or the motion of the waters should reach the\r\nplace where the fish are collected, and the sailors are commanded to\r\nrow in the greatest silence until they have enclosed them.\r\n\r\n8. Sometimes, when they wish to drive them together, they proceed as in\r\ndolphin catching, for they make a noise with stones that they may be\r\nalarmed and collected together, and thus they are enclosed in a net.\r\nBefore their inclosure, as it was said, they prevent a noise, but as\r\nsoon as they have enclosed them, they direct the sailors to shout and\r\nmake a noise, for they fall down with fear when they hear the noise and\r\ntumult.\r\n\r\n9. And when the fishers observe large shoals at a distance, collected\r\non the surface in calm, fine weather, and wish to know their size,\r\nand of what kind they are, if they can approach them in silence, they\r\navoid their notice, and catch them while they are on the surface. If\r\nany noise is made before they reach them, they may be seen in flight.\r\nIn the rivers, also, there are little fish under the stones, which\r\nsome persons call cotti:[143] from their dwelling beneath rocks, they\r\ncatch them by striking the rocks with stones, and the fishes fall\r\ndown frightened when they hear the noise, being stunned by it. It is\r\nevident, from these considerations, that fishes have the sense of\r\nhearing.\r\n\r\n[143] Perhaps Cottus gobio L., miller's thumb. Salmo Fario (_Strack_).\r\n\r\n10. There are persons who say that fish have more acute ears than other\r\nanimals, and that, from dwelling near the sea, they have often remarked\r\nit. Those fish which have the most acute ears are the cestreus[144]\r\n(chremps),[145] labrax,[146] salpe,[147] chromis,[148] and all such\r\nfishes; in others the sense of hearing less acute, because they live in\r\nthe deeper parts of the ocean.\r\n\r\n[144] Mullet.\r\n\r\n[145] Unknown.\r\n\r\n[146] Perca Labrax.\r\n\r\n[147] Scomber.\r\n\r\n[148] Unknown.\r\n\r\n11. Their nature of smelling is the same, for the greater number of\r\nfishes will not take a bait that is not quite fresh; others are less\r\nparticular. All fish will not take the same bait, but only particular\r\nbaits, which they distinguish by the smell; for some are taken with\r\nstinking baits, as the salpe with dung. Many fish also live in the\r\nholes of rocks, and when the fishermen want to entice them out, they\r\nanoint the mouths of these holes with salted scents, to which they\r\nreadily come.\r\n\r\n12. The eel also is enticed out in this way, for they place a pitcher\r\nof salt food, covering the mouth of the pitcher with another vessel\r\npierced with holes, and the eels are quickly drawn forth by the smell\r\nof the bait. Baits made of the roasted flesh of the cuttle fish, on\r\naccount of its strong smell, attract fish very readily. They say they\r\nput the roasted flesh of the polypus upon their hooks for nothing but\r\nits strong smell.\r\n\r\n13. And the fish called rhyades,[149] when the washings of fish or\r\nof fœtid drains are emptied into the water, make their escape as if\r\nsmelling the fœtid odour. They say that fish soon smell the blood of\r\ntheir own kind; this is plain from their hastening from any place where\r\nthe blood of fishes may be. On the whole, if any one use a putrid bait,\r\nthe fish will not come near it; but if a fresh strong-smelling bait is\r\nused, they will come to it from a great distance.\r\n\r\n[149] A fish living in shoals.\r\n\r\n14. This is especially observable in what was said of dolphins, for\r\nthese creatures have not external organs of hearing, but are captured\r\nby being stunned with a noise, as was before observed; neither have\r\nthey any external organs of smell, yet their scent is acute. Therefore,\r\nit is evident that all creatures have these senses. Other kinds of\r\nanimals are divided into four classes; and these contain the multitude\r\nof remaining animals, namely, the malacia, malacostraca, testacea, and\r\ninsects.\r\n\r\n15. Of these the malacia, the malacostraca, and insects have all the\r\nsenses, for they can see, smell, and taste. Insects, whether they have\r\nwings or are apterus, can smell from a great distance, as the bee and\r\nthe cnips[150] scent honey, for they perceive it from a long distance,\r\nas if they discovered it by the scent. Many of them perish by the\r\nfumes of sulphur: ants leave their hills when origanum and sulphur are\r\nsprinkled upon them. Almost all of them escape from the fumes of burnt\r\nstags' horns, but most of all do they avoid the smell of burnt styrax.\r\n\r\n[150] Perhaps some species of ant.\r\n\r\n16. The sepia, also, the polypus, and the carabus are caught with\r\nbaits; the polypus holds the bait so fast that it holds on even when\r\ncut: if a person hold conyza to them, they let go as soon as they smell\r\nit. So, also, of the sense of taste, for they follow different kinds\r\nof food, and do not all prefer the same food, as the bee approaches\r\nnothing that is putrid, only sweet things; the gnat not what is sweet,\r\nbut what is acid.\r\n\r\n17. As I before observed, the sense of touch belongs to all animals.\r\nThe testacea have the senses of smelling and tasting. This is plain\r\nfrom the baits used, as those for the purpuræ; for this creature is\r\ncaught with putrid substances, and will be attracted from a great\r\ndistance to such baits, as if by the sense of smell. It is evident from\r\nwhat follows that they possess the sense of taste; for whatever they\r\nselect by smell, they all love to taste.\r\n\r\n18. And all animals with mouths receive pain or pleasure from the\r\ncontact of food. But, concerning the senses of sight and hearing, it is\r\nnot possible to say anything certain, or very distinct; the solens, if\r\na person touch them, appear to retract themselves, and try to escape\r\nwhen they see an instrument approaching them, for a small portion\r\nof them is beyond the shell, the remainder as it were in a retreat;\r\nthe pectens, also, if a finger is brought near them, open and shut\r\nthemselves as if they could see.\r\n\r\n19. Those who seek for neritæ do not approach them with the wind, when\r\nthey seek them for baits, nor do they speak, but come silently, as if\r\nthe creatures could both smell and hear; they say that if they speak,\r\nthey get away. Of all testacea, the echinus appears to have the best\r\nsense of smell amongst those that can move, and the tethya and balanus\r\nin those that are fixed. This is the nature of the organs of sense in\r\nall animals.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n1. The following is the nature of the voice of animals, for there is\r\na distinction between voice and sound. Speech, again, is different\r\nfrom these. Voice is due to no other part except the pharynx, the\r\ncreatures, therefore, without lungs are also without voice. Speech is\r\nthe direction of the voice by the tongue; the vowels are uttered by\r\nthe voice and the larynx, the mutes by the tongue and the lips; speech\r\nis made up of these: wherefore, no animals can speak that have not a\r\ntongue, nor if their tongue is confined.\r\n\r\n2. The power of uttering a sound is connected with other parts also;\r\ninsects have neither voice nor speech, but make a sound with the air\r\nwithin them, not with that which is external, for some of them breathe\r\nnot, some of them buzz, as the bee with its wings, and others are said\r\nto sing, as the grasshopper. All these make a noise with the membrane\r\nwhich is beneath the division of their body in those which have a\r\ndivision, as some families of grasshoppers by the friction of the air.\r\nThese insects, bees, and all other insects raise and depress their\r\nwings in flight, for the sound is the friction of the air within them.\r\nLocusts produce a sound by rubbing themselves with their legs, which\r\nare adapted for leaping. None of the malacia utter any sound or natural\r\nvoice, nor do the malacostraca.\r\n\r\n3. Fish also are mute, for they have neither lungs, trachea, nor\r\npharynx. Some of them utter a sound and a squeak; these are said to\r\nhave a voice, as the lyra[151] and chromi,[152] for these utter, as\r\nit were, a grunt; so does the capros, a fish of the Achelous, the\r\nchalceus[153] and coccyx,[154] for the one utters a sound like hissing,\r\nthe other a noise like that of the cuckoo, from whence also its name\r\nis derived. Some of these utter their apparent voice by the friction\r\nof their gills, for these places are spinous, in others the sound is\r\ninternal, near the stomach. For each of them has an organ of breathing,\r\nwhich causes a sound when it is pressed and moved about.\r\n\r\n[151] Trigla Lyra.\r\n\r\n[152] Cottus cataphractus.\r\n\r\n[153] Zeus faber.\r\n\r\n[154] Trigla hirundo.\r\n\r\n4. Some of the selachea also appear to whistle, but they cannot be\r\ncorrectly said to utter a voice, only to make a sound. The pectens\r\nalso make a whizzing noise when they are borne upon the surface of the\r\nwater, or flying, as it is called; and so do the sea-swallows,[155]\r\nfor they also fly through the air in the same way, not touching the\r\nsea, for they have wide and long fins. As the sound made by birds\r\nflying through the air is not a voice, so neither can either of these\r\nbe properly so called. The dolphin also utters a whistle and lows when\r\nit comes out of the water into the air, in a different way from the\r\nanimals above-mentioned--for this is a true voice, for it has lungs and\r\na trachea, but its tongue is not free, nor has it any lips so as to\r\nmake an articulate sound.\r\n\r\n[155] Flying fish.\r\n\r\n5. The oviparous quadrupeds, with a tongue and lungs, utter a sound,\r\nthough it is a weak one. Some of them hiss like serpents; others have\r\na small weak voice, others, as the tortoise, utter a small hiss. The\r\ntongue of the frog is peculiar, for the fore-part of it is fixed, like\r\nthat of a fish; but the part near the pharynx is free and folded up.\r\nWith this it utters its peculiar sound. The male frogs make a croaking\r\nin the water when they invite the females to coition.\r\n\r\n6. All animals utter a voice to invite the society and proximity of\r\ntheir kind, as the hog, the goat, and the sheep. The frog croaks by\r\nmaking its lower jaw of equal length, and stretching the upper one\r\nabove the water. Their eyes appear like lights, their cheeks being\r\nswelled out with the vehemence of their croaking; for their copulation\r\nis generally performed in the night. The class of birds utter a voice:\r\nthose which have a moderately wide tongue have the best voice; those\r\nalso in which the tongue is thin. In some kinds both male and female\r\nhave the same voice; in others it is different: the smaller kinds have\r\nmore variety in their voice, and make more use of it, than the larger\r\ntribes.\r\n\r\n7. All birds become more noisy at the season of coition. Some utter a\r\ncry when they are fighting, as the quail; others when they are going to\r\nfight, as the partridge; or when they have obtained a victory, as the\r\ncock. In some kinds both male and female sing, as the nightingale; but\r\nthe female nightingale does not sing while she is sitting or feeding\r\nher young: in some the males alone, as the quail and the cock; the\r\nfemale has no voice. Viviparous quadrupeds utter different voices; none\r\ncan speak--for this is the characteristic of man, for all that have\r\na language have a voice, but not all that have a voice have also a\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\n8. All that are born dumb, and all children, utter sounds, but have no\r\nlanguage; for, as children are not complete in their other parts, so\r\ntheir tongue is not perfect at first; it becomes more free afterwards,\r\nso that they stammer and lisp. Both voices and language differ in\r\ndifferent places.\r\n\r\n9. The voice is most conspicuous in its acuteness or depth, but the\r\nform does not differ in the same species of animals; the mode of\r\narticulation differs, and this might be called speech, for it differs\r\nin different animals, and in the same genera in different places, as\r\namong partridges, for in some places they cackle, in others whistle.\r\nSmall birds do not utter the same voice as their parents, if they are\r\nbrought up away from them, and have only heard other singing birds. For\r\nthe nightingale has been observed instructing her young, so that the\r\nvoice and speech are not naturally alike, but are capable of formation.\r\nAnd men also have all the same voice, however much they may differ in\r\nlanguage. The elephant utters a voice by breathing through its mouth,\r\nmaking no use of its nose, as when a man breathes forth a sigh; but\r\nwith its nose it makes a noise like the hoarse sound of a trumpet.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n1. Concerning the sleep and wakefulness of animals. It is quite\r\nmanifest that all viviparous animals with feet both sleep and are\r\nawake; for all that have eyelids sleep with the eyes closed; and not\r\nonly men appear to dream, but horses, oxen, sheep, goats, dogs, and all\r\nviviparous quadrupeds. Dogs show this by barking in their sleep. It is\r\nnot clear whether oviparous animals dream, but it is quite plain that\r\nthey sleep.\r\n\r\n2. And so it is in aquatic animals, as fish, the malacia, the\r\nmalacostraca, the carabi, and such like creatures. The sleep of all\r\nthese animals is short: it is plain that they do sleep, though we can\r\nform no conclusion from their eyes, for they have no eyelids, but from\r\ntheir not being alarmed; for if fish are not tormented with lice, and\r\nwhat are called psylli, they may be captured without alarming them, so\r\nthat they can be even taken with the hand. And if fish remain at rest\r\nduring the night a great multitude of these creatures fall upon and\r\ndevour them.\r\n\r\n3. They are found in such numbers at the bottom of the sea as to devour\r\nany bait made of fish that remains any length of time upon the ground;\r\nfishermen frequently draw them out hanging like globes around the\r\nbait. The following considerations will serve still more to confirm\r\nour suppositions that fishes sleep; for it is often possible to fall\r\nupon the fish so stealthily as to take by the hand, or even strike them\r\nduring this time; they are quite quiet, and exhibit no signs of motion\r\nexcept with their tails, which they move gently. It is evident, also,\r\nthat they sleep, from their starting if anything moves while they are\r\nasleep, for they start as if they were waked out of sleep.\r\n\r\n4. They are also taken by torchlight while asleep; those who are\r\nseeking for thynni surround them while asleep; it is evident that\r\nthey can be captured from their stillness, and the half-open white\r\n(of their eyes). They sleep more by night than by day, so that they\r\ndo not move when they are struck; they generally sleep holding by the\r\nground, or the sand, or a stone, at the bottom, concealing themselves\r\nbeneath a rock, or a portion of the shore. The flat fishes sleep in the\r\nsand; they are recognized by their form in the sand, and are taken by\r\nstriking them with a spear with three points. The labrax, chrysophrys,\r\ncestreus, and such-like fish are often taken with the same kind of\r\nweapon while asleep in the day time, but if not taken then, none of\r\nthem can be captured with such a spear.\r\n\r\n5. The selache sleep so soundly that they may be taken with the hand;\r\nthe dolphin, whale, and all that have a blow-hole, sleep with this\r\norgan above the surface of the sea, so that they can breathe, while\r\ngently moving their fins, and some persons have even heard the dolphin\r\nsnore. The malacia sleep in the same manner as fish, and so do the\r\nmalacostraca. It is evident from the following considerations that\r\ninsects sleep; for they evidently remain at rest without motion; this\r\nis particularly plain in bees, for they remain quiet, and cease to hum\r\nduring the night. This is also evident from those insects with which\r\nwe are most familiar, for they not only remain quiet during the night\r\nbecause they cannot see distinctly, for all creatures with hard eyes\r\nhave indistinct vision, but they seem no less quiet when the light of a\r\nlamp is set before them.\r\n\r\n6. Man sleeps the most of all animals. Infants and young children do\r\nnot dream at all, but dreaming begins in most at about four or five\r\nyears old. There have been men and women who have never dreamt at\r\nall; sometimes such persons, when they have advanced in age, begin\r\nto dream; this has preceded a change in their body, either for death\r\nor infirmity. This, then, is the manner of sensation, sleep and\r\nwakefulness.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n1. In some animals the sexes are distinct, in others they are not\r\nso, these are said to beget and be with young by a likeness to other\r\ncreatures. There is neither male nor female in fixed animals, nor in\r\ntestacea. In the malacia and malacostraca there are male and female\r\nindividuals, and in all animals with feet, whether they have two or\r\nfour, which produce either an animal, an egg, or a worm from coition.\r\n\r\n2. In other kinds the sexes are either single or not single; as in all\r\nquadrupeds there is the male and female, in the testacea it is not\r\nso, for as some vegetables are fertile and others barren, so it is in\r\nthese. Among insects and fishes there are some that have no differences\r\nof this kind, as the eel is neither male nor female, nor is anything\r\nproduced from them.\r\n\r\n3. But those persons who say that some eels appear to have creatures\r\nlike worms, of the size of a hair, attached to them, speak without\r\nobservation, not having seen how they really are; for none of these\r\ncreatures are viviparous without being first oviparous, none of them\r\nhave ever been observed to contain ova; those that are viviparous have\r\nthe embryo attached to the uterus, and not to the abdomen, for there it\r\nwould be digested like food. The distinction made between the so-called\r\nmale and female eel that the male has a larger and longer head, and\r\nthat the head of the female is smaller, and more rounded, is a generic,\r\nand not a sexual distinction.\r\n\r\n4. There are some fish called epitragiæ, and among fresh-water fish the\r\ncyprinus and balagrus are of the same nature, which never have ova or\r\nsemen; those which are firm and fat, and have a small intestine, appear\r\nto be the best. There are creatures, such as the testacea, and plants,\r\nwhich beget, and produce young, but have no organ of coition; and so\r\nalso in fishes the psetus,[156] erythrhinus,[157] and the channa. All\r\nthese appear to have ova.\r\n\r\n[156] Pleuronectes Lingua and Rhombus.\r\n\r\n[157] Perca marina, or Sparus erithrinus.\r\n\r\n5. In sanguineous animals with feet that are not oviparous, the males\r\nare generally larger and longer lived than the females, except the\r\nhemionus, but the females of this animal are both larger and longer\r\nlived; in oviparous and viviparous animals, as in fish and insects, the\r\nfemales are larger than the males, as the serpent, phalangium,[158]\r\nascalabotes,[159] and frog; in fish likewise, as in most of the small\r\ngregarious selache, and all that inhabit rocks.\r\n\r\n[158] Aranca tarantula.\r\n\r\n[159] Lacerta Gekko.\r\n\r\n6. It is evident that female fishes have longer lives than males,\r\nbecause females are caught of a greater age than the males; the upper\r\nand more forward parts of all animals are larger and stronger, and more\r\nfirmly built in the male; the hinder and lower parts in the female.\r\nThis is the case in the human subject, and all viviparous animals with\r\nfeet: the female is less sinewy, the joints are weaker, and the hairs\r\nfiner, in those with hair; in those without hair, its analogues are of\r\nthe same nature; the female has softer flesh and weaker knees than the\r\nmale, the legs are slighter; the feet of females are more graceful, in\r\nall that have these members.\r\n\r\n7. All females, also, have a smaller and more acute voice than the\r\nmales, but in oxen the females utter a deeper sound than the males; the\r\nparts denoting strength, as the teeth, tusks, horns, and spurs, and\r\nsuch other parts, are possessed by the males, but not by the females,\r\nas the roe-deer has none, and the hens of some birds with spurs have\r\nnone; the sow has no tusks: in some animals they exist in both sexes,\r\nonly stronger and longer in the males, as the horns of bulls are\r\nstronger than those of cows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THE FIFTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n1. We have hitherto treated of the external and internal parts of all\r\nanimals, of their senses, voice, and sleep, with the distinctions\r\nbetween the males and females; it remains to treat of their generation,\r\nspeaking first of those which come first in order, for they are many,\r\nand have numerous varieties, partly dissimilar, and partly like each\r\nother. And we will pursue the same order in considering them as we did\r\nbefore in their division into classes; we commenced our consideration\r\nby treating of the parts in man, but now he must be treated of last,\r\nbecause he is much more intricate.\r\n\r\n2. We shall begin with the testacea, and after these treat of the\r\nmalacostraca, and the others in the order of their succession. These\r\nare the malacia and insects, next to these fishes, both viviparous and\r\noviparous; next to them birds, and afterwards we must treat of animals\r\nwith feet, whether viviparous or oviparous; some viviparous creatures\r\nhave four feet, man alone has two feet. The nature of animals and\r\nvegetables is similar, for some are produced from the seed of other\r\nplants, and others are of spontaneous growth, being derived from some\r\norigin of a similar nature. Some of them acquire their nourishment\r\nfrom the soil, others from different plants, as it was observed when\r\ntreating of plants.\r\n\r\n3. So also some animals are produced from animals of a similar form,\r\nthe origin of others is spontaneous, and not from similar forms; from\r\nthese and from plants are divided those which spring from putrid\r\nmatter, this is the case with many insects; others originate in the\r\nanimals themselves, and from the excrementitious matter in their parts;\r\nthose which originate from similar animals, and have both the sexes\r\nare produced from coition, but of the class of fishes there are some\r\nneither male nor female, these belong to the same class among fishes,\r\nbut to different genera, and some are quite peculiar. In some there\r\nare females but no males, by these the species is continued as in the\r\nhypenemia among birds.\r\n\r\n4. All these among birds are barren, (for nature is able to complete\r\nthem as far as the formation of an egg,) unless persons suppose that\r\nthere is another method of communicating the male influence, concerning\r\nwhich we shall speak more plainly hereafter. In some fish, after the\r\nspontaneous production of the ovum, it happens that living creatures\r\nare produced, some by themselves, others by the aid of the male. The\r\nmanner in which this is done will be made plain in a future place, for\r\nnearly the same things take place in the class of birds.\r\n\r\n5. Whatever are produced spontaneously in living creatures, in the\r\nearth, or in plants, or in any part of them, have a distinction in the\r\nsexes, and by the union of the sexes something is produced, not the\r\nsame in any respect, but an imperfect animal, as nits are produced from\r\nlice, and from flies and butterflies are produced egg-like worms, from\r\nwhich neither similar creatures are produced, nor any other creature,\r\nbut such things only. First of all, then, we will treat of coition, and\r\nof the animals that copulate, and then of others, and successively of\r\nthat which is peculiar to each, and that which is common to them all.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n1. Those animals in which there is a distinction of the sexes use\r\nsexual intercourse, but the mode of this intercourse is not the same\r\nin all, for all the males of sanguineous animals with feet have an\r\nappropriate organ, but they do not all approach the female in the same\r\nmanner, but those which are retromingent, as the lion, the hare, and\r\nthe lynx, unite backwards, and the female hare often mounts upon the\r\nmale; in almost all the rest the mode is the same, for most animals\r\nperform the act of intercourse in the same way, the male mounting upon\r\nthe female; and birds perform it in this way only.\r\n\r\n2. There are, however, some variations even among birds; for the male\r\nsometimes unites with the female as she sits upon the ground, as the\r\nbustard and domestic fowl: in others, the female does not sit upon\r\nthe ground, as the crane; for in these birds the male unites with\r\nthe female standing up; and the act is performed very quickly, as in\r\nsparrows. Bears lie down during the act of intercourse, which is\r\nperformed in the same manner as in those that stand on their feet, the\r\nabdomen of the male being placed upon the back of the female: in the\r\nhedgehogs, the abdomens of both sexes are in contact.\r\n\r\n3. Among the large animals, the roe-deer seldom admits the stag, nor\r\nthe cow the bull, on account of the hardness of the penis; but the\r\nfemale receives the male by submission. This has been observed to take\r\nplace in tame deer. The male and female wolf copulate like dogs. Cats\r\ndo not approach each other backwards, but the male stands erect, and\r\nthe female places herself beneath him. The females are very lascivious,\r\nand invite the male, and make a noise during the intercourse.\r\n\r\n4. Camels copulate as the female is lying down, and the male embraces\r\nand unites with her, not backwards, but like other animals. They remain\r\nin intercourse a whole day. They retire into a desert place, and suffer\r\nno one to approach them but their feeder. The penis of the camel is\r\nso strong, that bowstrings are made of it. Elephants also retire into\r\ndesert places for intercourse, especially by the sides of rivers which\r\nthey usually frequent. The female bends down and divides her legs, and\r\nthe male mounts upon her. The seal copulates like retromingent animals,\r\nand is a long while about it, like dogs. The males have a large penis.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n1. Oviparous quadrupeds with feet copulate in the same manner: in some,\r\nthe male mounts upon the female, like viviparous animals, as in the\r\nmarine and land turtle, for they have an intromittent organ by which\r\nthey adhere together, as the trygon and frog, and all such animals.\r\n\r\n2. But the apodous long animals, as serpents and murænæ, are folded\r\ntogether, with the abdomens opposite, and serpents roll themselves\r\ntogether so closely, that they seem to be but one serpent with two\r\nheads. The manner of the whole race of saurians is the same, for they\r\nunite together in the same kind of fold.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n1. All fish, except the flat selache, perform the act of intercourse\r\nby approaching each other with their abdomens opposite: but the\r\nflat fish, with tails, as the batos, trygon, and such like, not only\r\napproach each other, but the male applies his abdomen to the back of\r\nthe female, in all those in which the thickness of the tail offers no\r\nimpediment. But the rhinæ, and those which have a large tail, perform\r\nthe act by the friction of their abdomens against each other, and some\r\npersons say that they have seen the male selache united to the back of\r\nthe female, like dogs.\r\n\r\n2. In all those that resemble the selache, the female is larger\r\nthan the male; and in nearly all fish the female is larger than the\r\nmale. The selache are those which have been mentioned; and the bos,\r\nlamia, æetus, narce, batrachus, and all the galeode. All the selache\r\nhave been frequently observed to conduct themselves in this way. In\r\nall viviparous creatures the act occupies a longer time than in the\r\noviparous. The dolphin and the cetacea also perform the act in the same\r\nmanner, for the male attaches himself to the female for neither a very\r\nlong, nor a very short time.\r\n\r\n3. The males of some of the fish which resemble the selache differ from\r\nthe females, in having two appendages near the anus, which the females\r\nhave not, as in the galeodea; for these appendages exist in them all.\r\nNeither fish nor any other apodal animal has testicles, but the males,\r\nboth of serpents and of fish, have two passages, which become full of a\r\nseminal fluid at the season of coition; and all of them project a milky\r\nfluid. These passages unite in one, as they do in birds; for birds have\r\ntwo internal testes, and so have all oviparous animals with feet. In\r\nthe act of coition this single passage passes to, and is extended upon\r\nthe pudendum and receptacle of the female.\r\n\r\n4. In viviparous animals with feet, the external passage for the\r\nsemen and the fluid excrement is the same: internally these passages\r\nare distinct, as I said before in describing the distinctive parts\r\nof animals. In animals which have no bladder, the anus is externally\r\nunited with the passage of the semen, internally the passages are\r\nclose together; and this is the same in both sexes: for none of them\r\nhave a bladder, except the tortoise. The female of this animal, though\r\nfurnished with a bladder, has but one passage; but the tortoise is\r\noviparous.\r\n\r\n5. The sexual intercourse of the oviparous fish is less evident,\r\nwherefore many persons suppose that the female is impregnated by\r\nswallowing the semen of the male; and they have been frequently\r\nobserved to do this. This is seen at the season of coition, when the\r\nfemales follow the males, and are observed to strike them on the\r\nabdomen with their mouths, this causes the males to eject their semen\r\nmore rapidly. The males do the same with the ova of the females, for\r\nthey swallow them as they are extruded, and the fish are born from\r\nthose ova which remain.\r\n\r\n6. In Phœnicia they use each sex for capturing the other; for having\r\ntaken the male cestreus, they entice the females with it, and so\r\nenclose them in a net. They use the females in the same way for\r\ncatching the males. The frequent observation of these circumstances\r\nappears to corroborate this manner of intercourse among them.\r\nQuadrupeds also do the same thing, for at the season of coition both\r\nsexes emit a fluid, and smell to each other's pudenda.\r\n\r\n7. And if the wind blows from the cock partridge to the hen, these last\r\nare impregnated; and often, if they hear the voice of the cock when\r\nthey are inclined for sexual intercourse, or if he flies over them,\r\nthey become pregnant from the breath of the cock. During the act of\r\nintercourse, both sexes open their mouths, and protrude their tongues.\r\nThe true intercourse of oviparous fish is rarely observed, from the\r\nrapidity with which the act is accomplished; for their intercourse has\r\nbeen observed to take place in the manner described.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n1. All the malacia, as the polypus, sepia, and teuthis, approach each\r\nother in the same manner, for they are united mouth to mouth; the\r\ntentacula of one sex being adapted to those of the other; for when\r\nthe polypus has fixed the part called the head upon the ground, it\r\nextends its tentacula, which the other adapts to the expansion of its\r\ntentacula, and they make their acetabula answer together. And some\r\npersons say that the male has an organ like a penis in that one of\r\nits tentacula which contains the two largest acetabula. This organ is\r\nsinewy, as far as the middle of the tentaculum, and they say that it is\r\nall inserted into the nostril of the female.\r\n\r\n2. The sepia and loligo swim about coiled together in this way,\r\nand with their mouths and tentacula united, they swim in contrary\r\ndirections to each other. They adapt the organ called the nostril\r\nof the male to the similar organ in the female; and the one swims\r\nforwards, and the other backwards. The ova of the female are produced\r\nin the part called the physeter, by means of which some persons say\r\nthat they copulate.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n1. The malacostraca, as the carabi, astaci, carides, and such like\r\nperform the act of intercourse like the retromingent animals, the one\r\nlying upon its back, and the other placing its tail upon it. They\r\ncopulate on the approach of spring, near the land; for their sexual\r\nintercourse has often been observed, and sometimes when the figs begin\r\nto ripen.\r\n\r\n2. The astaci and the carides perform the act in the same manner; but\r\nthe carcini approximate the fore part of their bodies to each other,\r\nand adapt also the folds of their tails to each other. First of all,\r\nthe smaller carcinus mounts from behind, and when he has mounted, the\r\ngreater one turns on its side. In no other respect does the female\r\ndiffer from the male, but that the tail, which is folded on the body,\r\nis larger and more distant, and more thick set with appendages: upon\r\nthis the ova are deposited, and the excrement ejected. Neither sex is\r\nfurnished with an intromittent organ.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n1. Insects approach each other from behind, and the smaller one\r\nsubsequently mounts upon the larger. The male is always the smaller.\r\nThe female, which is below, inserts a member into the male, which is\r\nabove, and not the male into the female, as in other animals. In some\r\nkinds this organ appears large in proportion to the size of the body,\r\nespecially in those that are small, in others it is less. The organ may\r\nbe plainly discerned if two flies are separated while in the act of\r\ncoition. They are separated from each other with difficulty, for the\r\nact of intercourse in such animals occupies a long time. This may be\r\nplainly discerned by common observation, as in the fly and cantharis.\r\n\r\n2. All adopt the same method, the fly, cantharis, spondyla[160],\r\nphalangium, or any other insect that copulates. All the phalangia that\r\nspin a web unite in the following manner. The female draws a filament\r\nfrom the middle of the web, and then the male draws it back again,\r\nand this they do a great many times till they meet, and are united\r\nbackwards, for this kind of copulation suits them on account of the\r\nsize of their abdomen. The copulation of animals is accomplished in\r\nthis manner.\r\n\r\n[160] A beetle living at the roots of trees, Carabus.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n1. All animals have their proper season and age for coition; the nature\r\nof most creatures requires them to have intercourse with each other\r\nwhen winter is turning into summer. This is the spring season, in\r\nwhich all animals with wings, feet, or fins, are incited to coition.\r\nSome copulate and produce their young in the autumn and winter, as\r\nsome aquatic and winged creatures. Mankind are ready at all seasons,\r\nand so are many other animals which associate with man; this arises\r\nfrom greater warmth, and better food, and is usual among those which\r\nare pregnant only for a short time, as the hog, dog, and those birds\r\nwhich have frequent broods. Many animals appear to adapt the season of\r\ncoition to that which they consider the best for the nurture of their\r\nyoung.\r\n\r\n2. Among mankind the male is more disposed for sexual intercourse in\r\nthe winter, and the female in the summer. Birds, as I have observed,\r\ngenerally pair in the spring and summer, except the halcyon. This bird\r\nhatches its young about the time of the winter solstice. Whereupon fine\r\ndays occurring at this season are called halcyon days, seven before the\r\nsolstice and seven after it. As Simonides also writes in his poems, \"as\r\nwhen in the winter months Jupiter prepares fourteen days, which mortals\r\ncall the windless season, the sacred nurse of the variegated halcyon.\"\r\n\r\n3. These fine days take place wherever it happens that the solstice\r\nturns to the south, when the pleiades set in the north. The bird is\r\nsaid to occupy seven days in building its nest, and the other seven in\r\nbringing out and nursing its young. The halcyon days are not always\r\nmet with in this country at the time of the solstice, but they always\r\noccur in the Sicilian Sea. The halcyon produces five eggs.\r\n\r\n4. The æthuia and the larus hatch their young among the rocks on the\r\nsea-side, and produce two or three, the larus during the summer, and\r\nthe æthuia at the beginning of the spring, immediately after the\r\nequinox; it sets upon its eggs like other birds; neither of these kinds\r\nconceal themselves. The halcyon is the rarest of all, for it is only\r\nseen at the season of the setting of the pleiades, and at the solstice,\r\nand it first appears at seaports, flying as much as round a ship, and\r\nimmediately vanishing away. Stesichorus also speaks of it in the same\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n5. The nightingale produces her young at the beginning of summer. She\r\nproduces five or six eggs. She conceals herself from the autumn to the\r\nbeginning of spring. Insects copulate and produce their young during\r\nthe winter whenever the days are fine, and the wind in the south, at\r\nleast such of them as do not conceal themselves, as the fly and ant.\r\nWild animals produce their young once a year, unless, like the hare,\r\nthey breed while they are nursing their young.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n1. Fish also generally breed once a year, as the chyti. All those which\r\nare caught in a net are called chyti; the thynnus, palamis, cestreus,\r\nchalais, colias, chromis, psetta, and such like, the labrax is an\r\nexception, for this alone of them all breeds twice a year, and the\r\nsecond fry of these are much weaker. The trichias[161] and rock fish\r\nbreed twice, the trigla is the only one that breeds three times a year.\r\nThis is shewn by the fry, which appear three times at certain places.\r\n\r\n[161] Clupea Sprottus.\r\n\r\n2. The scorpius breeds twice, and so does the sargus, in spring and\r\nautumn, the salpa once only in the spring. The thynnis breeds once, but\r\nas some of the fry are produced at first, and others afterwards, it\r\nappears to breed twice. The first fry makes its appearance in the month\r\nof December, after the solstice, the second in the spring. The male\r\nthynnis is different from the female, for the female has a fin under\r\nthe abdomen, called aphareus, which the male has not.\r\n\r\n3. Among the selachea, the rhine alone breeds twice in the year; at\r\nthe beginning of the autumn, and at the period of the setting of\r\nthe Pleiades. The young are, however, better in the autumn. At each\r\nbreeding season it produces seven or eight. Some of the galei, as the\r\nasterias, seem to produce their ova twice every month. This arises from\r\nall the ova not being perfected at once.\r\n\r\n4. Some fish produce ova at all seasons of the year, as the muræna: for\r\nthis fish produces many ova, and the fry rapidly increase in size, as\r\ndo those also of the hippurus,[162] for these, from being very small,\r\nrapidly increase to a great size; but the muræna produces young at\r\nall seasons, the hippurus in the spring. The smyrus differs from the\r\nmuræna, for the muræna is throughout variegated and weak. The smyrus is\r\nof one colour, and strong; its colour is that of the pine tree, and it\r\nhas teeth both internally and externally. They say that these are the\r\nmale and the female, as in others. These creatures go upon the land,\r\nand are often taken.\r\n\r\n[162] Coryphœna hippurus.\r\n\r\n5. The growth of all fish is rapid, and not the least so in the\r\ncoracinus among small fish. It breeds near the land, in thick places\r\nfull of seaweed. The orphos also grows rapidly. The pelamis and thynnus\r\nbreed in Pontus, and nowhere else. The cestreus, chrysophrys, and\r\nlabrax, breed near the mouths of rivers. The orcynes and scorpides, and\r\nmany other kinds, in the sea.\r\n\r\n6. Most fish breed in March, April, and May; a few in the autumn, as\r\nthe salpe, sargus, and all the others of this kind a little before\r\nthe autumnal equinox; and the narce and rhine also. Some breed in the\r\nwinter and summer, as I before observed, as the labrax, cestreus, and\r\nbelona in the winter; the thynnis in June, about the summer solstice:\r\nit produces, as it were, a bag, containing many minute ova. The rhyas\r\nalso breeds in the summer. The chelones among the cestræi begin to\r\nbreed in the month of December, and so does the sargus, the myxon, as\r\nit is called, and the cephalus. They go with young thirty days. Some of\r\nthe cestrei do not originate in coition, but are produced from mud and\r\nsand.\r\n\r\n7. The greater number of them contain ova in the spring, but some, as\r\nI observed, in the summer, autumn, and winter. But this does not take\r\nplace in all alike, nor singly, nor in every kind, as it does in most\r\nfish which produce their young in the spring: nor do they produce as\r\nmany ova at other seasons. But it must not escape our notice, that as\r\ndifferent countries make a great difference in plants and animals, not\r\nonly in the habit of their body, but also in the frequency of their\r\nsexual intercourse and production of young; so different localities\r\nmake a great difference in fish, not only in their size, and habit of\r\ntheir body, but in their young, and the frequency or rarity of their\r\nsexual intercourse, and of their offspring in this place or that.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n1. The malacia breed in the spring, and first of all the marine sepia,\r\nthough this one breeds at all seasons. It produces its ova in fifteen\r\ndays. When the ova are extruded, the male follows, and ejects his ink\r\nupon them, when they become hard. They go about in pairs. The male is\r\nmore variegated than the female, and blacker on the back. The sexes of\r\nthe polypus unite in the winter, the young are produced in the spring,\r\nwhen these creatures conceal themselves for two months. It produces\r\nan ovum like long hair, similar to the fruit of the white poplar. The\r\nfecundity of this animal is very great, for a great number of young\r\nare produced from its ova. The male differs from the female in having\r\na longer head, and the part of the tentaculum which the fishermen call\r\nthe penis is white. It incubates upon the ova it produces, so that it\r\nbecomes out of condition, and is not sought after at this season.\r\n\r\n2. The purpuræ produce their ova in the spring, the ceryx at the end\r\nof the winter; and, on the whole, the testacea appear to contain ova\r\nin the spring and autumn, except the eatable echini. These principally\r\nproduce their young at the same seasons, but they always contain some\r\nova, and especially at the full and new moon, and in fine weather, but\r\nthose which live in the Euripus of the Pyrrhæi are better in winter.\r\nThey are a small kind but full of ova. All the cochleæ appear to\r\ncontain ova at the same season.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n1. The undomesticated birds, as it was observed, generally pair and\r\nbreed once a-year. The swallows and cottyphus breed twice, but\r\nthe first brood of the cottyphus is killed by the cold, for it is\r\nthe earliest breeder of all birds. It is able, however, to bring\r\nup the other brood. But the domestic birds, and those capable of\r\ndomestication, breed frequently, as pigeons during the whole summer,\r\nand domestic fowls. For these birds have sexual intercourse, and\r\nproduce eggs all the year round, except at the winter solstice.\r\n\r\n2. There are many kinds of pigeons, for the peleias and peristera\r\nare different. The peleias is the smaller, but the peristera is more\r\nreadily tamed. The peleias is black and small, and has red and rough\r\nfeet, for which reason it is never domesticated. The phatta is the\r\nlargest of the tribe, the next is the œnas, which is a little larger\r\nthan the peristera, the trygon is the least of all. If the peristera\r\nis supplied with a warm place and appropriate food, it will breed and\r\nbring up its young at any season of the year. If it is not properly\r\nsupplied, it will only breed in the summer. Its young ones are best\r\nduring the spring and autumn, those produced in the hot weather in\r\nsummer are the worst.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n1. Animals also differ in the age at which sexual intercourse\r\ncommences. For in the first place the period at which the spermatic\r\nfluid begins to be secreted, and the age of puberty is not the same,\r\nbut different; for the young of all animals are barren, or if they do\r\npossess the power of reproduction, their offspring are weak and small.\r\nThis is very conspicuous in mankind, and in viviparous quadrupeds and\r\nbirds, for in the one the offspring, in the other the eggs, are small.\r\nThe age of puberty is nearly the same in the individuals of each kind,\r\nunless any alteration takes place, either as ominous, or from an injury\r\ndone to their nature.\r\n\r\n2. In men this period of life is shown by the change of voice, and not\r\nonly by the size but by the form of the pudendum and of the breasts in\r\nwomen, but especially by the growth of hair on the pubes. The secretion\r\nof the spermatic fluid commences about the age of fourteen, the power\r\nof reproduction at twenty-one. Other animals have no hair on the pubes,\r\nfor some have no hair at all, and others have none upon their under\r\nside, or less than on their upper side, but the change of the voice is\r\nconspicuous in some of them. And in others different parts of the body\r\nsignify the period of the formation of the semen, and of the power of\r\nreproduction.\r\n\r\n3. In almost all animals the voice of the female and of the young is\r\nmore acute than that of the male and the older animals, for even the\r\nstags have a deeper voice than their females. The males utter their cry\r\nat the season of copulation, the females when they are alarmed. The\r\nvoice of the female is short, that of the male longer. And the barking\r\nof old dogs is also deeper than of young ones, and the voice of the\r\nhorse also varies. The females utter a little small cry as soon as they\r\nare born, and the males do the same, but their voice is deeper than\r\nthat of the female, and as they grow older, it still increases. When\r\nthey are two years old, and reach puberty, the male utters a great deep\r\nvoice, that of the female is greater and clearer than it was at first;\r\nthis continues till they are twenty years old at the outside, and after\r\nthat the voice, both of the male and female, becomes weaker.\r\n\r\n4. For the most part, then, as we observed, the voice of the male\r\ndiffers from that of the female in depth, in those animals which utter\r\na lengthened sound. There are, however, some exceptions, as oxen; for\r\nin these animals the voice of the female is deeper than that of the\r\nmale, and the voice of the calf than that of the full-grown animal;\r\nwherefore also in the castrated animals, the voice changes the other\r\nway, for it becomes more like that of the female.\r\n\r\n5. The following are the ages at which animals acquire the power of\r\nreproduction. The sheep and goat arrive at puberty within a year\r\nafter they are born, and especially the goat, and the males as well\r\nas the females, but the offspring of these males and of the others is\r\ndifferent. For the males are better the second year than when they\r\nbecome older. In hogs, the male and female unite at eight months old,\r\nand the female produces her young when she is a year old, for this\r\nagrees with the period of gestation. The male reaches puberty at eight\r\nmonths old, but his offspring are useless till he is a year old. But\r\nthese periods, as we have said, are not always the same, for swine\r\nwill sometimes copulate when they are four months old, so as to have\r\nyoung and nurse them at six months old, and boars sometimes reach\r\npuberty at ten months old, and continue good to three years old.\r\n\r\n6. The bitch reaches puberty within a year after birth, and so does the\r\ndog, and sometimes this takes place at the end of eight months, but\r\nmore frequently in the male than in the female. The period of gestation\r\nis sixty days, or one or two, or perhaps three days more, but never\r\nless than sixty days, or if they produce young in a less time, it never\r\ncomes to perfection. The bitch is ready for sexual intercourse again in\r\nsix months, but never sooner. The horse reaches puberty in both sexes\r\nat two years old, and is capable of reproduction, but its offspring at\r\nthat age are small and weakly. For the most part, sexual intercourse\r\nbegins at three years of age, and the colts continue to improve from\r\nthat period till they are twenty years old. The male is useful till he\r\nis thirty years old, so that he can beget during almost the whole of\r\nhis life, for the horse generally lives five-and-thirty years, and the\r\nmare more than forty, and a horse has been known to live seventy-five\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n7. The ass reaches puberty in both sexes at the age of thirty months;\r\nthey rarely, however, produce young till they are three years, or\r\nthree years and six months old. But it has been known to be pregnant\r\nand bring up its young within the year. The cow also has been known to\r\nproduce young and rear it within the year after birth, which grew to\r\nthe ordinary size, and no more.[163]\r\n\r\n[163] This probably means \"to such a size as might be expected from the\r\nearly age of the parent.\"\r\n\r\n8. These are the periods of puberty in these animals. The seventieth\r\nyear in man, and the fiftieth in woman, is the latest period of\r\nreproduction, and this happens rarely, for only a few have had children\r\nat this time of life. Sixty-five is generally the boundary in one sex,\r\nand forty-five in the other. The sheep produces young till it is eight\r\nyears old, and, if well treated, until it is eleven, though the act of\r\ncopulation is continued in both sexes during the whole period of life.\r\n\r\n9. Fat goats are rarely productive, wherefore they compare barren vines\r\nwith barren goats, but they are productive when they are lean. The\r\nrams copulate with the old sheep first, but they do not follow after\r\nthe younger; and the younger, as I before observed, produce a smaller\r\noffspring than the older.\r\n\r\n10. A wild boar will beget till he is three years old, but the\r\nprogeny of older animals is inferior; for he has not the same power\r\nor strength. He generally goes to the female when full of food, and\r\nwithout having been to another female, or, if not, the act of coition\r\nis of shorter duration, and the progeny smaller. The sow produces the\r\nsmallest number of pigs at her first litter, but at the second they\r\nare more flourishing. She also produces young when old, but the act of\r\ncoition is longer. At fifteen years old, she no longer produces young,\r\nbut becomes fierce.\r\n\r\n11. If well-fed, she will be more ready for sexual intercourse, whether\r\nyoung or old; and, if rapidly fattened when pregnant, she has less milk\r\nafter parturition. As regards the age of the parent, the young of those\r\nin the prime of their age are the best, and those that are born at the\r\nbeginning of winter. The worst are those born in the summer, for they\r\nare small, and thin, and weak. If the male is well fed, he is ready\r\nfor sexual intercourse at all seasons, by day as well as by night; but\r\nif not well fed, he is most ready in the morning, and as he grows old,\r\nhe becomes less disposed for it, as was said before. And it frequently\r\nhappens that those which are impotent, through age or weakness, and\r\ncannot copulate readily, will approach the female as she lies down\r\ntired with long standing. The sow generally becomes pregnant when she\r\nhangs down her ears in her heats; if she is not pregnant, she becomes\r\nheated again.\r\n\r\n12. Bitches do not copulate during the whole of their life, but only\r\nto a certain period. Their coition and pregnancy generally takes\r\nplace till they are twelve years old, but both males and females have\r\nbeen known to perform the act of coition at eighteen and even twenty\r\nyears of age; but old age takes away from both sexes the power of\r\nreproduction, as in other animals.\r\n\r\n13. The camel is retroningent, and performs the act of intercourse in\r\nthe manner already described; the period of its coition in Arabia is\r\nin the month of September; the female goes with young twelve months,\r\nand produces one foal, for the animal is one of those which produce but\r\none. Both the male and female arrive at puberty at the age of three\r\nyears, and the female is ready for the male again at the end of a year\r\nafter parturition.\r\n\r\n14. The elephant arrives at puberty, the earliest at ten years of age,\r\nthe latest at fifteen, and the male at five or six years old. The\r\nseason for the intercourse of the sexes is in the spring: and the male\r\nis ready again at the end of three years, but he never touches again\r\na female whom he has once impregnated. Her period of gestation is two\r\nyears, and then she produces one calf, for the elephant belongs to the\r\nclass of animals which have but one young one at a time. The young one\r\nis as large as a calf of two or three months old. This, then, is the\r\nnature of the sexual intercourse of those animals which perform this\r\nfunction.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n1. We must now treat of the mode of reproduction, both of those animals\r\nwhich use sexual intercourse, and those which do not; and, first of\r\nall, we will speak of the testacea, for this is the only entire class\r\nwhich is not reproduced by sexual intercourse. The purpuræ collect\r\ntogether in the spring, and produce what is called their nidamental\r\ncapsules (melicera), for it is like honey-comb, though not so deeply\r\ncut, but, as it were, made up of the white pods of vetches. These\r\ncapsules have neither opening nor perforation, nor are the purpuræ\r\nproduced from them; but both these and other testacea are produced from\r\nmud and putrefaction. But this substance is an excrementitious matter\r\nboth in the purpura and the ceryx, for these last also produce similar\r\ncapsules.\r\n\r\n2. The testacea which produce these capsules are generated in the\r\nsame way as the rest of their class, but more readily when there are\r\nhomogeneous particles pre-existing among them; for, when they deposit\r\ntheir nidamental capsules, they emit a clammy mucus, from which the\r\nscales of the capsules are formed. When all these have been deposited,\r\nthey emit upon the ground a sort of chyle, and small purpuræ spring up\r\nupon the same spot and adhere to the larger purpuræ, though some of\r\nthese can hardly be distinguished by their form. But if they are taken\r\nbefore the breeding season, they will sometimes breed in the baskets,\r\nnot indeed anywhere, but they collect together like they do in the\r\nsea, and the narrow limits of their place of captivity make them hang\r\ntogether like bunches of fruit.\r\n\r\n3. There are many kinds of purpuræ, some of which are large, as those\r\nwhich are found near Sigeum and Lectum; and others are small, as those\r\nin the Euripus and on the Carian coast. Those found in gulfs are large\r\nand rough. Most of them contain a black pigment; in others it is red,\r\nand the quantity of it small. Some of the largest weigh as much as a\r\nmina. Near the shore and on the coast they are small, and the pigment\r\nis red. Those which are natives of the north contain a black pigment;\r\nin those of the south it is red, generally speaking.\r\n\r\n4. They are taken in the spring, about the time that they deposit their\r\ncapsules, but they are never taken during the dog-days, for then they\r\ndo not feed, but conceal themselves and get out of the way. The pigment\r\nis contained between the mecon and the neck. The union of these parts\r\nis thick, and the colour is like a white membrane; this is taken away.\r\nWhen this is bruised, the pigment wets and stains the hand. Something\r\nresembling a vein passes through it, and this appears to be the\r\npigment; the nature of the rest resembles alum.[164] The pigment is the\r\nworst at the period of depositing their nidamental capsules.\r\n\r\n[164] Evidently a corrupt reading.\r\n\r\n5. The small ones are pounded up, shells and all, for it is not easy to\r\nseparate them; but they separate the larger kinds from the shells, and\r\nthen extract the pigment. For this purpose the mecon is divided from\r\nthe neck, for the pigment lies above the part called the stomach, and\r\nwhen this is taken away, they are divided asunder. They are careful to\r\nbruise them while alive, for if they die before they are cut up, they\r\nvomit up the pigment; for this reason they keep them in the baskets\r\ntill a sufficient number is collected, and there is time to procure the\r\npigment.\r\n\r\n6. The ancients did not let down or fasten any basket-net to their\r\nbaits, so that it often happened that the purpura fell off as they\r\nwere drawn up; but at the present time they use basket-nets, in order\r\nthat if the purpura should fall off, it may not be lost. They are most\r\nlikely to fall off when full, but when empty it is difficult to draw\r\nthem from the bait. These are the peculiarities of the purpura. The\r\nnature of the ceryx is the same as that of the purpura, and so are\r\ntheir seasons.\r\n\r\n7. They both have opercula, and so have all turbinated shell-fish, from\r\nthe period of their birth. They feed by forcing out their tongue, as\r\nit is called, beneath the operculum: the purpura has a tongue larger\r\nthan a finger, with which it feeds upon and pierces the conchylia, and\r\neven the shells of its own species. Both the purpura and the ceryx are\r\nlong-lived, for the purpura lives six years, and its annual increase is\r\nseen in the divisions on the helix of its shell.\r\n\r\n8. The mya also deposits nidamental capsules; those which are called\r\nlimnostrea are the first to originate in muddy places, but the conchæ,\r\nchemæ, solens, and pectens find their subsistence in sandy shores;\r\nthe pinnæ grow up from their byssus both in sandy and muddy shores.\r\nThe pinnæ always contain a pinnophylax, either like a small caris or\r\ncancer, and soon die when this is extracted. On the whole, all the\r\ntestacea are produced spontaneously in mud different kinds originating\r\nin different sorts of mud: the ostrea is found in mud, the conchæ and\r\nothers that have been mentioned in sand. The tethya, balanus, and\r\nothers which live on the surface, as the patella and nerita, originate\r\nin holes in the rocks. All these reach maturity very soon, especially\r\nthe purpuræ and pectens, for they are matured in one year.\r\n\r\n9. Very small white cancri are produced in some of the testacea,\r\nespecially in the myæ that inhabit muddy places, and next to this in\r\nthe pinnæ those which are called pinnoteræ; they occur also in the\r\npectens and limnostrea. These animals apparently never grow; and the\r\nfishermen say that they are produced at the same time as the creatures\r\nthey inhabit. The pectens disappear for some time in the sand, and\r\nso do the purpuræ. The ostrea (bivalves) are produced in the manner\r\ndescribed, for some of them originate in shallow water, others near the\r\nshore, or among rocks, or in rough hard places, or in sand; and some\r\nhave the power of locomotion, others have not.\r\n\r\n10. Among those that are not locomotive, the pinnæ are fixed; the\r\nsolens and conchæ remain on one spot, though not fixed, and do not\r\nsurvive separation from their home. The nature of the aster[165] is\r\nso hot, that if it is captured immediately after swallowing anything,\r\nits food is found digested; and they say that it is very troublesome\r\nin the Pyrrhæan Euripus. Its form is like the paintings of a star. The\r\ncreatures called pneumones are spontaneously produced. The shell which\r\npainters use is very thick, and the pigment is produced on the outside\r\nof the shell; they are principally found in the neighbourhood of Caria.\r\n\r\n[165] Star-fish.\r\n\r\n11. The carcinium also originates in earth and mud, and afterwards\r\nmakes its way into an empty shell, and when it grows too large for\r\nthat, it leaves it for a larger one, as the shell of the nerita,\r\nstrombus, and such like; it frequently occurs in the small ceryx. When\r\nit has entered the shell, it carries it about and lives in it, except\r\nthat as it grows it migrates into a larger shell.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n1. The nature of the testacea is the same as that of creatures without\r\nshells, as the cnidæ[166] and sponges, which inhabit the holes in\r\nrocks. There are two kinds of cnidæ, some which live in holes in the\r\nrocks, and cannot be separated from them, and other migrating species\r\nwhich live upon the smooth flat surface of the rocks. (The patella also\r\nis free and locomotive.) In the interior of the sponges are found the\r\ncreatures called pinnophylaces, and the interior is closed with a net\r\nlike a spider's web, and small fish are captured by opening and closing\r\nthis web, for it opens as they approach, and closes upon them when they\r\nhave entered.\r\n\r\n[166] Actinia.\r\n\r\n2. There are three kinds of sponges; one of them is thin, the other\r\nis thick, and the third, which is called the Achillean sponge, is\r\nslender, compact, and very strong; it is placed beneath helmets and\r\nthigh-pieces, for the sake of deadening the sound of blows; this kind\r\nis very rare. Among the compact kinds, those which are very hard and\r\nrough are called tragi. They all grow upon the rock or near the shore,\r\nand obtain their food from the mud. This is evident, for they are full\r\nof mud when they are captured. This is the case with all other fixed\r\nthings, that they derive their food from the spot to which they are\r\nattached.\r\n\r\n3. The compact species are weaker than those which are thin, because\r\ntheir point of attachment is smaller. It is affirmed that the sponge\r\npossesses sensation; this is a proof of it, that it contracts if it\r\nperceives any purpose of tearing it up, and renders the task more\r\ndifficult. The sponge does the same thing when the winds and waves\r\nare violent, that it may not lose its point of attachment. There are\r\nsome persons who dispute this, as the natives of Torona. The sponge is\r\ninhabited by worms and other living creatures, which the rock-fish eat\r\nwhen the sponge is torn up, as well as the remainder of its roots. But\r\nif the sponge is broken off, it grows again, and is completed from the\r\nportion that is left.\r\n\r\n4. The thin sponges are the largest, and they are most abundant on\r\nthe Lycian coast; the compact sponges are softer, and the Achillean\r\nare more harsh than the others. On the whole, those that inhabit deep\r\nplaces with a mild temperature are the softest, for wind and cold\r\nweather harden them, as they do other growing things, and stop their\r\nincrease. For this reason the sponges of the Hellespont are rough and\r\ncompact; and, altogether, those beyond Malea, and those on this side,\r\ndiffer in softness and hardness.\r\n\r\n5. Neither should the heat be very great, for the sponge becomes\r\nrotten, like plants, wherefore those near the shore are the best,\r\nespecially if the water is deep near the land, for the temperature is\r\nmoderated by the depth. When alive, before they are washed, they are\r\nblack. Their point of attachment is neither single nor dispersed over\r\nthe whole surface, for there are empty passages between the points of\r\nattachment. Something like a membrane is extended over their lower\r\npart, and the attachment is by several points; on the upper part are\r\nother closed passages, and four or five which are apparent. Wherefore\r\nsome persons say that these are the organs by which they take their\r\nfood.\r\n\r\n6. There is also another species called aplysia, because it cannot\r\nbe washed. This has very large passages; but the other parts of the\r\nsubstance are quite compact. When cut open it is more compact and\r\nsmooth than the sponge, and the whole is like a lung; of all the\r\nsponges this one is confessed to have the most sensation, and to be\r\nthe most enduring. They are plainly seen in the sea near the sponges,\r\nfor the other sponges are white as the mud settles down upon them, but\r\nthese are always black. This is the mode of production in sponges and\r\ntestacea.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n1. Among the malacostraca the carabi are impregnated by sexual\r\nintercourse, and contain their ova during three months, May, June, and\r\nJuly. They afterwards deposit them upon the hollow part of their folded\r\ntail, and their ova grow like worms. The same thing takes place in the\r\nmalacia and oviparous fish, for their ova always grow.\r\n\r\n2. The ova of the carabi are sandy, and divided into eight parts;\r\nfor a cartilaginous appendage, round which the ova are attached, is\r\nunited to each of the opercula at their junction with the side; and the\r\nwhole resembles a bunch of grapes, for every one of the cartilaginous\r\nappendages is frequently subdivided, and the divisions are apparent to\r\nany one who will separate them, but when first seen they appear to be\r\nunited. Those ova which are in the centre are larger than those which\r\nare contiguous to the perforation, and the last are the least.\r\n\r\n3. The smallest ova are as large as millet; the ova are not continuous\r\nwith the perforation, but in the middle. For two divisions extend on\r\neach side, from the tail and from the thorax, and this is also the line\r\nof junction for the opercula. The ova, which are placed at the side,\r\ncannot be enclosed, unless the extremity of the tail is drawn over\r\nthem; this, however, covers them like a lid.\r\n\r\n4. The female, in depositing her ova, appears to collect them on the\r\ncartilaginous appendages by means of the broad part of the folded tail.\r\nShe produces them by pressing with her tail and bending her body. These\r\ncartilaginous processes at the season of oviposition increase in size,\r\nin order to become appropriate receptacles for the ova. The ova are\r\ndeposited on these processes, as those of the sepia are deposited upon\r\nbroken pieces of wood or anything floating in the sea. This is the\r\nmanner of depositing them; but after they have been ripened twenty\r\ndays, they are cast off altogether in a mass, as they appear when\r\nseparated from the parent; in fifteen days, at the outside, the carabi\r\nare produced from these ova, and they are often taken off less than\r\na finger's length. The ova are produced before Arcturus, and after\r\nArcturus they are cast off.\r\n\r\n5. The cyphæ among the carides contain their ova about four months.\r\nThe carabi are found in rough and rocky places, the astaci in those\r\nthat are smooth; but neither of them inhabit mud. For this cause the\r\nastaci are found in the Hellespont and near Thasus; the carabi in the\r\nneighbourhood of Sigeum and Athos. Fishermen, when they pursue their\r\ncalling in the open sea, distinguish the rough and muddy places by the\r\nnature of the shore, and other signs. In the spring and winter they\r\ncome near the shore; in summer time they go into deep water, sometimes\r\nfor the sake of warmth, and sometimes for the cold.\r\n\r\n6. Those called arcti[167] breed nearly at the same time as the carabi,\r\nwherefore they are most excellent in winter and in spring before the\r\nbreeding season, and they are worst after they have deposited their\r\nova. They change their shell in the spring, like the serpent, which\r\nputs off its old age, as it is called. Both the carabi and the carcini\r\ndo this when they are young, as well as afterwards. All the carabi are\r\nlong-lived.\r\n\r\n[167] Perhaps, Cancer spinosissimus.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n1. The malacia produce a white ovum after sexual intercourse; in the\r\ncourse of time this becomes sandy, like that of the testacea. The\r\npolypus deposits its ova in holes or pots, or any other hollow place;\r\nthe ovum is like bunches of the wild vine and of the white poplar, as\r\nwas observed before; when the ova are produced they remain suspended\r\nfrom the hole in which they were deposited; and the ova are so\r\nnumerous, that when taken out they will fill a vessel much larger than\r\nthe head of the polypus in which they were contained.\r\n\r\n2. About fifty days afterwards the young polypi burst the eggs and\r\nescape, like phalangia, in great numbers. The particular shape of each\r\nlimb is not distinct, though the general form is plain. Many of them\r\nperish from their small size and debility. Some have been observed so\r\nsmall that they could not be distinguished, unless they were touched,\r\nwhen they were seen to move.\r\n\r\n3. The sepia also deposits eggs, which resemble large, black, myrtle\r\nseeds. They are united together like a bunch of fruit, and are enclosed\r\nin a substance which prevents them from separating readily. The male\r\nemits his ink upon them, a mucous fluid, which causes their slippery\r\nappearance. The ova increase in this way; and when first produced they\r\nare white, but when they have touched the ink they become large and\r\nblack. When the young sepia, which is entirely formed of the internal\r\nwhite of the ovum, is produced, it makes its way out by the rupture of\r\nthe membrane of the ovum.\r\n\r\n4. The ovum which the female first produces is like hail, and to this\r\nthe young sepia is attached by the head, as birds are attached to\r\nthe abdomen. The nature of the umbilical attachment has never been\r\nobserved, except that as the sepia increases the white always becomes\r\nless, and at last entirely disappears, like the yolk of the eggs of\r\nbirds.\r\n\r\n5. The eyes are at first very large in these as in other animals, as in\r\nthe diagram. The ovum is seen at A, the eyes at B and C, and the embryo\r\nsepia itself at D. The female contains ova during the spring. The ova\r\nare produced in fifteen days; and when the ova are produced they remain\r\nfor fifteen days longer like the small seeds of grapes, and when these\r\nare ruptured the young sepias escape from the inside. If a person\r\ndivides them before they have reached maturity, the young sepias emit\r\ntheir fœces and vary in colour, and turn from white to red from alarm.\r\n\r\n6. The crustaceans incubate upon their ova, which are placed beneath\r\nthem; but the polypus and sepia and such like incubate upon their ova\r\nwherever they may be deposited, and especially the sepia, for the\r\nfemale has often been observed with her abdomen upon the ground, but\r\nthe female polypus has been observed sometimes placed upon her ova,\r\nand sometimes upon her mouth, holding with her tentacula over the hole\r\nin which the ova were deposited. The sepia deposits her ova upon the\r\nground among fuci and reeds, or upon any thing thrown in the water,\r\nas wood, branches, or stones; and the fishermen are careful to place\r\nbranches of trees in the water. Upon these they deposit their long and\r\nunited ova like branches of fruit.\r\n\r\n7. The ova are deposited and produced by repeated exertion, as if the\r\nparturition were accompanied with pain. The teuthis oviposits in the\r\nsea. The ova, like those of the sepia, are united together. Both the\r\nteuthus and sepia are short-lived, for very few of them survive a year.\r\nThe same is the case with the polypus. Each egg produces one small\r\nsepia, and so also in the teuthis. The male teuthus differs from the\r\nfemale; for if the hair (branchia) are drawn aside, the female will be\r\nseen to have two red substances like mammæ, which the male does not\r\npossess. The sepia also has the same sexual distinction, and is more\r\nvariegated than the female, as I observed before.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n1. It has already been observed that the male insects are less than\r\nthe female, and that the male mounts upon the female; and the manner\r\nof their sexual intercourse has been described, and the difficulty\r\nof separating them. Most of them produce their young very soon after\r\nsexual intercourse. All the kinds except some psychæ (butterflies and\r\nmoths) produce worms. These produce a hard substance, like the seed\r\nof the cnecus,[168] which is fluid within. From the worm an animal is\r\nproduced, but not from a portion of it, as if it were an ovum, but the\r\nwhole grows and becomes an articulated animal.\r\n\r\n[168] Cantharus tinctorius, a plant of the thistle kind. L. and S.\r\n\r\n2. Some of them are produced from similar animals, as phalangia and\r\nspiders from phalangia and spiders, and attelabi,[169] locusts, and\r\ngrasshoppers. Others do not originate in animals of the same species,\r\nbut their production is spontaneous, for some of them spring from the\r\ndew which falls upon plants. The origin of these is naturally in the\r\nspring, though they often appear in the winter, if fine weather and\r\nsouth winds occur for any length of time. Some originate in rotten mud\r\nand dung; and others in the fresh wood of plants or in dry wood; others\r\namong the hair of animals, or in their flesh, or excrements, whether\r\nejected, or still existing in the body, as those which are called\r\nhelminthes.\r\n\r\n[169] The larva of some species.\r\n\r\n3. There are three kinds of these, the flat worms, the round worms,\r\nand those which are called ascarides. From these creatures nothing\r\nis produced; but the broad worm is attached to the intestine, and\r\nproduces something like the seed of the colocynth, and this is used by\r\nphysicians as a proof of the presence of the worm.\r\n\r\n4. Butterflies are produced from caterpillars; and these originate\r\nin the leaves of green plants, especially the rhaphahus, which\r\nsome persons call crambe. At first they are smaller than millet,\r\nafterwards they grow into little worms, in three days they become\r\nsmall caterpillars, afterwards they grow and become motionless, and\r\nchange their form. In this state the creature is called chrysalis. It\r\nhas a hard covering, but moves when it is touched. They are united to\r\nsomething by weblike processes, and have no mouth nor any other visible\r\norgan. After a short time the covering is burst, and a winged animal\r\nescapes, which is called a butterfly.\r\n\r\n5. At first, while in the caterpillar state, they take food and\r\nevacuate fœces, but in the chrysalis state they do neither. The same is\r\nthe case with all other creatures which originate in worms, and those\r\nwhich produce worms after sexual intercourse, or even without this\r\nprocess; for the offspring of bees, anthrenæ, and wasps, while they are\r\nyoung worms, consume food and evacuate excrement, but when from worms\r\nthey receive their conformation they are called nymphæ, and neither\r\nfeed nor evacuate, but remain quiet in their covering until they are\r\ngrown. They then make their escape by cutting through a place where the\r\ncell is fastened on.\r\n\r\n6. The penia[170] and hypera[171] also are produced from a kind of\r\ncampe (caterpillar) which make a wave as they walk, and as they\r\nadvance bend the hinder extremity up to that which has preceded. The\r\ncreature produced always derives its colour from the campe in which\r\nit originates. A certain great worm, which has as it were horns, and\r\ndiffers from others, at its first metamorphosis produces a campe,\r\nafterwards a bombylius, and lastly a necydalus. It passes through all\r\nthese forms in six months. From this animal some women unroll and\r\nseparate the bombycina (cocoons), and afterwards weave them. It is\r\nsaid that this was first woven in the island of Cos by Pamphila, the\r\ndaughter of Plateos.\r\n\r\n[170] Some species of larva.\r\n\r\n[171] Geometra.\r\n\r\n7. From the worms in dry wood the insects called carabi are produced in\r\nthe same manner; for at first they are immoveable worms, and afterwards\r\nthe carabi are produced by the rupture of their case. The crambides\r\noriginate in the plant called crambe, and these also have wings, and\r\nthe prasocurides from the plant called prasum (onion). The œstri are\r\nproduced from the little flat creatures that are found on the surface\r\nof rivers. Wherefore also they congregate in the greatest numbers\r\naround the waters where such animals are found. The kind of pygolampis\r\nwhich has no wings originates in a small, black, hairy caterpillar.\r\nThese undergo another change, and turn into the winged creatures called\r\nbostrychi.\r\n\r\n8. The empides originate in ascarides, and the ascarides originate in\r\nthe mud of wells and running waters which flow over an earthy bottom.\r\nAt first the decaying mud acquires a white colour, which afterwards\r\nbecomes black, and finally red. When this takes place, very small red\r\ncreatures are seen growing in it like fuci. At first these move about\r\nin a mass, afterwards their connection is ruptured, the creatures\r\ncalled ascarides are borne about in the water, after a few days they\r\nstand erect in the water without motion and of a hard texture, and\r\nsubsequently the case is broken and the empis sits upon it until either\r\nthe sun or the wind enables it to move, then it flies away.\r\n\r\n9. The commencement of life in all other worms, and in all creatures\r\nproduced from worms, originates in the influence of the sun and wind.\r\nThe ascarides are produced in greater numbers, and more quickly, where\r\nthe various matters are mixed together, as in the works conducted in\r\nthe Megarian territory, for putrefaction thus takes place more readily.\r\nThe autumnal season also is favourable to their increase, for there is\r\nless moisture at that time of the year. The crotones[172] originate in\r\nthe agrostis, the melolonthæ from the worms which originate in the dung\r\nof oxen and asses.\r\n\r\n[172] Ticks. Acarus ricinus.\r\n\r\n10. The canthari which roll up dung, hide themselves in it during the\r\nwinter, and produce worms, which afterwards become canthari; and\r\nfrom the worms which inhabit the osprea,[173] winged creatures, like\r\nthose already mentioned, derive their existence. Flies originate in\r\ndung which has been set apart, and those who are employed in this work\r\nstrive to separate the remainder which is mixed together, for they say\r\nthat the dung is thus brought to putrefaction.\r\n\r\n[173] Vetches, leguminous plants.\r\n\r\n11. The origin of these worms is very small; for first of all a redness\r\nis perceived, and motion commences, as if they were united together.\r\nThe worm then again becomes still, afterwards it moves, and then again\r\nis immoveable. From this the worm is completed, and motion recommences\r\nunder the action of the sun and wind. The myops is produced in wood.\r\nThe orsodacnæ[174] from the metamorphosis of worms, which originate on\r\nthe stalks of the crambe. The cantharis from worms which dwell on the\r\nfig tree, apium (pear tree), and pitch tree, for there are worms on all\r\nthese, and on the cynacantha.[175] They assemble round strong smelling\r\nthings because they originate from them.\r\n\r\n[174] Chrysomela oleracea.\r\n\r\n[175] Perhaps the dog rose, or sweet briar.\r\n\r\n12. The conops springs from a worm which originates in the thick part\r\nof vinegar; for there seem also to be worms in things which are the\r\nfarthest from putrefaction, as in snow which has laid for some time:\r\nfor after having laid, it becomes red, wherefore, also, the worms\r\nare such and hairy. Those in the snow in Media are large and white,\r\nand furnished with but little power of motion. In Cyprus, when the\r\nmanufacturers of the stone called chalcitis burn it for many days in\r\nthe fire, a winged creature, something larger than a great fly, is seen\r\nwalking and leaping in the fire.\r\n\r\n13. The worms perish when they are taken out of the snow, and so do\r\nthese creatures when taken from the fire. And the salamander shews that\r\nit is possible for some animal substances to exist in the fire, for\r\nthey say that fire is extinguished when this animal walks over it.\r\n\r\n14. In the river Hypanis in the Cimmerian Bosphorus, about the summer\r\nsolstice, capsules larger than grape-seed are floated down the river:\r\nwhen these are ruptured, a four-footed, winged creature makes its\r\nescape, which lives and flies about till the evening. As the sun\r\ndescends, it becomes emaciated, and is dead by sunset, having lived\r\nbut one day; for which cause it is called ephemerum. Most animals which\r\nspring from caterpillars or worms, are first of all enclosed in a web,\r\nand this is their nature.\r\n\r\n15. The wasps which are called ichneumons, which are smaller than the\r\nothers, kill the phalangia, and carry them to a wall, or some other\r\nplace with a hole in it; and when they have covered them over with mud,\r\nthey oviposit there, and the ichneumon wasps are produced from them.\r\nMany of the coleoptera, and other small and anonymous creatures make\r\nlittle holes in tombs or walls, and there deposit their worms.\r\n\r\n16. The period of reproduction, from its commencement to its\r\nconclusion, is generally completed in three or four weeks. In the worms\r\nand worm-like creatures, three weeks are usually sufficient, and four\r\nweeks are usually enough for those which are oviparous. In one week\r\nfrom their sexual intercourse, the growth of the ovum is completed. In\r\nthe remaining three weeks, those that produce by generation, hatch and\r\nbring forth their ova, as in the spiders, and such like creatures. The\r\nmetamorphoses generally occupy three or four days, like the crisis of\r\ndiseases. This is the mode of generation in insects.\r\n\r\n17. They die from the shrivelling of their limbs, as large animals do\r\nof old age. Those which are furnished with wings have these organs\r\ndrawn together in autumn. The myopes die from an effusion of water in\r\ntheir eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n1. All persons are not agreed as to the generation of bees, for some\r\nsay that they neither produce young, nor have sexual intercourse; but\r\nthat they bring their young from other sources; and some say that they\r\ncollect them from the flowers of the calyntrus,[176] and others from\r\nthe flower of the calamus.[177] Others again, say that they are found\r\nin the flowers of the olive, and produce this proof, that the swarms\r\nare most abundant when the olives are fertile. Other persons affirm\r\nthat they collect the young of the drones from any of the substances we\r\nhave named, but that the rulers (queens) produce the young of the bees.\r\n\r\n[176] Honeysuckle.\r\n\r\n[177] Reed.\r\n\r\n2. There are two kinds of rulers, the best of these is red, the other\r\nblack and variegated: their size is double that of the working bees;\r\nthe part of the body beneath the cincture is more than half of the\r\nwhole length: by some they are called the mother bees, as if they were\r\nthe parents of the rest; and they argue, that unless the ruler is\r\npresent, drones only are produced, and no bees. Others affirm that they\r\nhave sexual intercourse, and that the drones are males, and the bees\r\nfemales.\r\n\r\n3. The other bees originate in the cells of the comb, but the rulers\r\nare produced in the lower part of the comb, six or seven of them\r\nseparated, opposite to the rest of the progeny. The bees have a sting,\r\nwhich the drones have not: the kings and rulers have a sting which they\r\ndo not make use of, and some persons suppose that they have none.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n1. There are several kinds of bees, the best are small, round, and\r\nvariegated: another kind is large, like the anthrene: a third kind is\r\ncalled phor; this is black, and has a broad abdomen: the drone is the\r\nfourth, and is the largest of all; it has no sting, and is incapable of\r\nwork, for which reason people often wrap something round their hives,\r\nso that the bees can enter, but the drones, being larger, cannot.\r\n\r\n2. There are two kinds of rulers among bees, as I observed before. In\r\nevery hive there are several rulers, and not a single one, for the hive\r\nperishes if there are not rulers enough (not that they thus become\r\nanarchical, but, as they say, because they are required for breeding\r\nthe bees); if there are too many rulers they perish, for thus they\r\nbecome distracted.\r\n\r\n3. If the spring is late, and drought and rusts are about, the progeny\r\nis small. When the weather is dry, they make honey. When it is damp,\r\ntheir progeny multiplies; for which reason, the olives and the swarms\r\nof bees multiply at the same time. They begin by making comb, in which\r\nthey place the progeny, which is deposited with their mouths, as those\r\nsay who affirm that they collect it from external sources. Afterwards\r\nthey gather the honey which is to be their food, during the summer and\r\nthe autumn; that which is gathered in the autumn is the best.\r\n\r\n4. Wax is made from flowers. They bring the material of wax from the\r\ndroppings of trees, but the honey falls from the air, principally about\r\nthe rising of the stars, and when the rainbow rests upon the earth.\r\nGenerally no honey is produced before the rising of the Pleiades. We\r\nargue that wax is made, as I said, from flowers, but that the bees do\r\nnot make honey, but simply collect that which falls; for those who keep\r\nbees find the cells filled with honey in the course of one or two days.\r\nIn the autumn there are flowers enough, but the bees make no honey,\r\nif that which they have produced is taken away. But if one supply was\r\ntaken away, and they were in want of food, they would make more if they\r\nprocured it from flowers.\r\n\r\n5. The honey becomes thick by ripening, for at first it is like water,\r\nand continues liquid for some days, wherefore it never becomes thick\r\nif it is taken away during that time. It requires twenty days to make\r\nit consistent; this is very plain from the taste of it, for it differs\r\nboth in sweetness and solidity. The bee carries honey from every plant\r\nwhich has cup-shaped flowers, and from all those which contain a sweet\r\nprinciple, but does not injure the fruit; it takes up and carries away\r\nthe sweet taste of plants with its tongue-like organ.\r\n\r\n6. The honey-comb is pressed when the wild figs begin to appear; and\r\nthey produce the best grubs when they can produce honey. The bees carry\r\nthe wax and bee-bread upon their legs, but the honey is disgorged into\r\nthe cells. After the progeny is deposited in the cells, they incubate\r\nlike birds. In the wax cells the little worm is placed at the side;\r\nafterwards it rises of itself to be fed. It is united to the comb in\r\nsuch a manner as to be held by it. The progeny both of the bees and\r\ndrones from which the little worms are produced, is white. As they grow\r\nthey become bees and drones. The progeny of the king-bees is rather\r\nred, and about the consistency of thick honey. In bulk it is as large\r\nas the creature which is produced from it. The progeny of the king-bee\r\nis not a worm, but comes forth a perfect bee, as they say; and, when\r\nthe progeny is produced in the comb, honey is found in that which is\r\nopposite.\r\n\r\n7. After the grub is covered up, it has wings and feet; and when it\r\nhas acquired wings, it bursts through the membrane, and flies away.\r\nIt evacuates an excrementitious matter while it is a worm, but not\r\nafterwards, until it is perfected, as I observed before. If a person\r\ncuts off the head of the grub before its wings are acquired, the other\r\nbees devour it; if a person having cut off the wings of a drone lets it\r\ngo, the bees will eat off the wings of the other drones.\r\n\r\n8. The bee will live for six years, some have lived for seven, and if a\r\nswarm lasts nine or ten years, it is considered to have done well. In\r\nPontus there are very white bees, which make honey twice every month.\r\nIn Therniscyra, near the river Thermodon, are found bees which make\r\ncells in the earth, and in hives with a very small quantity of wax, but\r\ntheir honey is thick. The cells are smooth and homogeneous. They only\r\ndo this in the winter, and not all the year round; for there is a great\r\ndeal of ivy in the place, which flowers at this season of the year,\r\nand from this they carry away the honey. From the higher regions of\r\nAmisus a kind of white honey is procured, which the bees form upon the\r\ntrees without wax. The same is also found in another place in Pontus.\r\nThere are also bees which form triple cells in the earth; these form\r\nhoney, but never have grubs. All such as these, however, are not cells,\r\nneither are they formed by every kind of bee.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n1. The anthrenæ[178] and wasps form cells for their progeny when they\r\nhave no rulers, but are wandering about in search of them, the anthrenæ\r\nupon some high place, the wasps in holes. But when they have the rulers\r\nthey form their cells underground. All their cells are hexagonal, like\r\nthose of bees; they are not formed of wax, but of a web-like membrane,\r\nmade of the bark of trees. The cells of the anthrenæ are far more\r\nelegant than those of wasps. Upon the side of their cells they place\r\ntheir progeny, in the manner of the bees, like a drop of liquid united\r\nto the wall of the cell. The progeny in all the cells is not alike, but\r\nin some they are so large as to be almost ready for flight, in others\r\nare nymphæ, in others grubs.\r\n\r\n[178] Hornet, Apis terrestris.\r\n\r\n2. The only excrementitious matter is found in the cells of the\r\ngrubs, as in the case of bees. As long as they are nymphæ they remain\r\nmotionless, and the cell is sealed over, and on the other side of the\r\ncell which contains their progeny, there is a drop of honey in the\r\ncombs of the anthrenæ. The grubs of these creatures are produced in the\r\nautumn, not in the spring, but they evidently grow most rapidly at the\r\nfull moon. The progeny and the grubs are not united to the bottom, but\r\nto the side of the cell.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n1. Some of the bombycia[179] form an angular cell of mud, which\r\nthey attach to a stone or something else, and smear with a kind of\r\ntransparent substance; this is so very thick and hard, that it can\r\nscarcely be broken with the blow of a spear. In this they deposit their\r\nova, and the white maggots are contained in a black membrane; and wax\r\nis formed in the mud without any membrane, this wax is much more yellow\r\nthan that of bees.\r\n\r\n[179] Apis cementaria.\r\n\r\n2. The ants also have sexual intercourse, and produce maggots which\r\nthey do not attach to anything. As these grow, they change from\r\nsmall round things to long articulated beings. The season for their\r\nproduction is in the spring.\r\n\r\n3. The land-scorpions also bring forth many egg-like maggots, upon\r\nwhich they incubate. When the young ones are perfect, they drive out\r\nand destroy their parents like spiders, for they are frequently eleven\r\nin number.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n1. The arachnia copulate in the manner already described, and produce\r\nmaggots which at first are small. After their metamorphosis they\r\nbecome spiders, not from a part but from the whole of the maggot,\r\nfor they are round from the first. When the female has produced her\r\nova, she incubates upon them, in three days they acquire limbs. All\r\nof them produce their young in a web, which is thin and small in some\r\nspecies, but compact in others. Some are enclosed entirely in a round\r\nreceptacle, and others are only partially covered by the web. All\r\nthe young spiders are not produced at once, but as soon as they are\r\nhatched they leap out and shoot forth a web. If they are bruised they\r\nare found to contain a thick white fluid like that of maggots.\r\n\r\n2. The field-spiders first of all deposit their ova in a web, of\r\nwhich one half is attached to themselves, and the other external,\r\nthey incubate upon this, and produce their young alive. The phalangia\r\ndeposit their ova in a thick basket which they weave, upon this they\r\nincubate. The smooth kinds produce a small number, the phalangia a\r\ngreat many. When they are grown, they surround their parent in a\r\ncircle, kill and throw her out. They often seize the male in the same\r\nway if they can catch him, for he assists the female in incubation.\r\nSometimes there are as many as three hundred round a single phalangium.\r\nThe little spiders become full-grown in about four weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n1. Locusts copulate in the same manner as all other insects, the\r\nsmaller mounting upon the larger, for the male is the smaller. They\r\noviposit by fixing the organ which is attached to their tail (the\r\novipositor) in the ground. The males do not possess this organ. Many\r\nof them deposit their ova in one spot, so as to make it appear like a\r\nhoney-comb. As soon as they have deposited their ova, egg-like maggots\r\nare formed, which are covered with a thin coating of earth like a\r\nmembrane, and in this they are matured.\r\n\r\n2. The young are so soft as to collapse if they are only touched. They\r\nare not produced on the surface, but a little below the surface of\r\nthe soil; and as soon as they are matured, they escape from the coat\r\nof soil in which they are enclosed as small black locusts. Their skin\r\nis subsequently ruptured, and they then attain their full size. They\r\nproduce their young at the end of summer, and then die.\r\n\r\n3. For as soon as they have deposited their ova, small worms make their\r\nappearance on their necks, the males also perish at the same time: they\r\ncome out of the earth in the spring. Locusts never shew themselves in\r\nmountainous countries, nor in poor land, but in plains, and broken\r\nsoil, for they deposit their ova in fissures. The ova remain in the\r\nsoil during the winter, and in the summer the locusts are produced from\r\nthe germs of the preceding year.\r\n\r\n4. The young of the attelabi are produced in the same manner, and the\r\nparents die after having deposited their ova. Their ova are destroyed\r\nby the rains of the autumn, if the weather is wet; but if that season\r\nis dry, many attelabi are produced, because they are not equally\r\ndestroyed; for their destruction appears to be irregular, and to take\r\nplace by accident.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\n1. There are two kinds of grasshoppers: some are small. These are the\r\nfirst to appear, the last to perish. Others, which chirp, are large:\r\nthese appear last, and disappear first. There is another difference\r\nbetween the small and large kind. Those which chirp have a division in\r\nthe middle of the body: those which do not chirp have none. The large\r\nones, which chirp, are called achetæ; the small are called tettigonia.\r\nSuch of these as are divided, sing a little.\r\n\r\n2. Grasshoppers do not appear where there are no trees, for which\r\nreason they are unknown in the open country of Cyrene, but are abundant\r\nnear the city, and especially among olive trees, for these do not give\r\nmuch shade, and grasshoppers are not produced in the cold, nor in very\r\nshady groves. Both the large and small ones have sexual intercourse\r\nwith their own kind, copulating with each other on their backs. The\r\nmale inserts his organ into the female, in the same manner as other\r\ninsects. The female has a divided pudendum. The female individual is\r\nthe one which receives the male.\r\n\r\n3. They deposit their ova in fields, piercing the soil with the organ\r\nat the extremity of their body, like the attelabi; for the attelabi\r\nalso oviposit in the fields, for which reason they are common in\r\nCyrene. They oviposit also in the reeds which are used to support\r\nthe vines; these they pierce: and so they do in the stems of the\r\nscilla. The young ones are washed into the earth, and are common in\r\nrainy weather. The maggot, when it is grown in the earth, becomes\r\na tettigometra: these are sweetest before they have ruptured their\r\ncovering.\r\n\r\n4. And when the season arrives for their appearance, about the\r\nsolstice, they come forth by night, and immediately burst their\r\nenvelope, and the tettigometra becomes a grasshopper. They immediately\r\nbecome black and hard, acquire their full size, and begin to chirp.\r\nIn both kinds the males chirp; the others, which do not chirp, are\r\nfemales. When first produced the males are the sweetest: after the\r\nsexual intercourse, the females are sweetest, for they contain white\r\nova.\r\n\r\n5. If a noise is made as they fly along, they emit a fluid like water,\r\nwhich the agriculturists describe as if they emitted both a liquid and\r\nsolid excrement, and that they feed on dew; and if any one approaches\r\nthem with a bent finger, which is gradually straightened, they will\r\nremain more quiet than if it is put out straight at once, and will\r\nclimb up upon the finger; for, from the dimness of their sight, they\r\nclimb upon it as if it were a moving leaf.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\n1. Those insects which are not carnivorous, but live upon the juices\r\nof living flesh, as lice, fleas, and bugs, produce nits from sexual\r\nintercourse; from these nits nothing else is formed. Of these insects\r\nthe fleas originate in very small portions of corrupted matter, for\r\nthey are always collected together where there is any dry dung.\r\nBugs[180] proceed from the moisture which collects on the bodies of\r\nanimals: lice from the flesh of other creatures; for before they\r\nappear, they exist in little pimples which do not contain matter: and\r\nif these are pricked, the lice[181] escape from them. Some persons have\r\nbeen afflicted with a disease arising from excessive moisture in the\r\nbody, of which people have died, as they say that Alcmon the poet, and\r\nPherecydes of Syria did.\r\n\r\n[180] Cinex lectularius.\r\n\r\n[181] Perhaps Acarus Scabiei, Itch insect.\r\n\r\n2. And in some diseases lice are very common. There is a kind of lice,\r\nwhich they call wild, and are harder than the common sort, which are\r\ndifficult to eradicate from the body. The heads of children are most\r\nsubject to be infested with lice, and men the least so, for women are\r\nmore liable to them than men. Those that have lice in the head are\r\nless subject to headache. Many other animals are infested with lice:\r\nfor both birds have them, and those which are called phasiani, unless\r\nthey dust themselves, are destroyed by them. And so are all those\r\ncreatures which have feathers with a hollow stem, and those which have\r\nhair, except the ass, which has neither lice nor ticks. Oxen have both;\r\nsheep and goats have ticks, but no lice; hogs are infested with large,\r\nhard lice, and dogs with those which are called cynoraïstæ. All lice\r\noriginate in the animals that are infested with them. All creatures\r\nthat have lice, and wash themselves, are more liable to them when they\r\nchange the water in which they bathe.\r\n\r\n3. In the sea is a kind of lice[182] growing on fish; but these do\r\nnot originate in the fish, but in the mud. Their appearance is that\r\nof wood-lice with many feet, except that they have a wide tail. There\r\nis one species of marine lice which occur everywhere, and especially\r\ninfest the trigla. All these creatures are furnished with many legs,\r\nare exsanguineous, and insects. The œstrus[183] of the thynnus occurs\r\nnear the fins: in shape it is like a scorpion, and as large as a\r\nspider. In the sea between Cyrene and Egypt, there is a fish called the\r\nphtheira, which accompanies the dolphin; it is the fattest of all fish,\r\nbecause it enjoys an abundance of the food which the dolphin hunts for.\r\n\r\n[182] Perhaps Oniscus Ceti, or Isora.\r\n\r\n[183] Perhaps Lernœa branchialis.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\n1. There are also other minute animals, as I observed before, some of\r\nwhich occur in wool,[184] and in woollen goods; as the moths, which\r\nare produced in the greatest abundance when the wool is dusty, and\r\nespecially if a spider is enclosed with them, for this creature is\r\nthirsty, and dries up any fluid which may be present. This worm also\r\noccurs in garments. There is one which occurs in old honeycombs, like\r\nthe creature which inhabits dry wood: this appears to be the least of\r\nall creatures, it is called acari, it is white and small. Others also\r\nare found in books,[185] some of which are like those which occur in\r\ngarments: others are like scorpions;[186] they have no tails, and are\r\nvery small. And on the whole, they occur in everything, so to say,\r\nwhich from being dry, becomes moist, or being moist, becomes dry, if it\r\nhas any life in it.\r\n\r\n[184] Tinea pellionella, or T. sarcitella.\r\n\r\n[185] Dumestes Pellio, and D. lardarius.\r\n\r\n[186] Phalangium cancroides.\r\n\r\n2. There is a little worm which is called xylophthorus,[187] which\r\nis no less extraordinary than these animals; for its variegated head\r\nis projected beyond its case, and its feet are at the extremity, as\r\nin other worms. The rest of the body is contained in a case made of\r\na substance like spider's web, and a dry material on the outside of\r\nthis; so that it appears to walk about with this attached to it. These\r\ncreatures are attached to their case, and as a snail to its shell, so\r\nthe whole of the case is joined to the worm, and it does not fall out\r\nof it, but is drawn out of it, as if they were joined together. If a\r\nperson pulls off the case, the creature dies, and becomes as helpless\r\nas a snail without its shell. As time advances, this grub becomes a\r\nchrysalis, like a caterpillar, and lies without motion: but the nature\r\nof the winged creature that is produced has never been ascertained.\r\n\r\n[187] Tinea graminella, Tinea lichenella, Tinea Xylophorus, or perhaps\r\nlarva of Phryganea.\r\n\r\n3. The wild figs upon the fig-trees contain a creature called\r\npsen;[188] this is at first a little worm, and afterwards having\r\nruptured the case, the psen flies out, and leaves it behind. It then\r\npierces the unripe figs, and causes them not to fall off, wherefore\r\ngardeners place wild fruit near the cultivated kinds, and plant the\r\nwild and cultivated plants near each other.\r\n\r\n[188] Cynips Psenes.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\n1. The sexual intercourse of sanguineous and oviparous quadrupeds takes\r\nplace in the spring. They do not, however, all copulate at the same\r\nseason; but some in the spring, others in the summer or autumn, as the\r\nseason is appropriate for bringing up the young of each species. The\r\ntortoise produces hard, two-coloured eggs, like those of birds. Having\r\ndeposited her eggs, she buries them, and makes a beaten place above\r\nthem. When this is done, she sits upon them. The eggs are hatched the\r\nfollowing year. The emys goes out of the water to deposit her eggs, and\r\ndigs a hole like a cask, in which she places her eggs and leaves them.\r\nHaving left them alone for less than thirty days, she digs them up\r\nagain and hatches them and leads them at once to the water. The marine\r\nturtles deposit their eggs in the earth like domestic birds, and cover\r\nthem up with earth and sit upon them during the night. They produce a\r\ngreat many eggs, as many as an hundred.\r\n\r\n2. The saurians and both the land and river crocodiles produce their\r\neggs upon the land. Those of the lizards are hatched spontaneously in\r\nthe earth; for the lizard does not live a whole year, for it is said\r\nto live only six months. The river crocodile produces as many as sixty\r\neggs, which are white. She sits upon them for sixty days, for they live\r\na long while. A very large animal is produced from these small eggs;\r\nfor the egg is not larger than that of a goose, and the young is in\r\nproportion, but when full grown the creature measures seventeen cubits.\r\nSome persons say that it grows as long as it lives.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nAmong serpents the viper is externally viviparous, but first of all\r\ninternally oviparous. The ovum, like that of fish, is of one colour and\r\nsoft skinned. The young are produced in the upper part. They are not\r\nenclosed in a shelly covering, neither are the ova of fish. The little\r\nvipers are produced in a membrane, which they rupture on the third\r\nday, and sometimes they make their escape by eating their way through\r\nthe mother. They are produced one by one in the course of a day, and\r\ntheir number often exceeds twenty. Other serpents are externally\r\noviparous, but their ova are joined together like women's necklaces.\r\nWhen the female deposits her eggs in the soil, she incubates upon them.\r\nThese also are hatched in the second year. This is the manner of the\r\nproduction of serpents, insects, and of oviparous quadrupeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THE SIXTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n1. The above describes the manner of reproduction in serpents, insects,\r\nand oviparous quadrupeds. All birds are oviparous, but the season of\r\nsexual intercourse and of bringing out their young is not the same in\r\nall; for some copulate and produce eggs at all seasons, as we may say,\r\nas the domestic fowl and the pigeon, for the domestic fowl lays eggs\r\nall the year round, except two months at the winter solstice. Some of\r\nthe finest birds will lay sixty eggs before they want to sit, though\r\nthese are not so fruitful as the more common kinds. The Adrianic fowls\r\nare very small, but they lay every day; but they are cruel, and often\r\nkill their chickens. Their colour is variegated. Some of the domestic\r\nbirds lay twice a-day, and some have been known to lay so many eggs\r\nthat they died very soon.\r\n\r\n2. The domestic fowls, as I said, lay continually; but the pigeon,\r\ndove, trygon, and œnas lay twice a-year; and the pigeon ten times. The\r\ngreatest number of birds lay in the spring; and some of them produce\r\nmany young, and this in two ways; some producing their young often, as\r\nthe pigeon; others producing many at a time, as the domestic fowl. All\r\nbirds with crooked claws, except the cenchris,[189] lay but few eggs.\r\nThis bird lays the most of any of its class; for it has been observed\r\nto produce four, and it even produces more. Some birds lay their eggs\r\nin nests; but those that do not fly, as partridges and quails, do not\r\nmake nests, but lay their eggs on the ground and cover them over with\r\nrubbish. The lark and tetrix[190] do the same.\r\n\r\n[189] Falco tinnunculus.\r\n\r\n[190] Tetrao tetrix or Otis tetrix.\r\n\r\n3. These birds make their nests in a place sheltered from the wind.\r\nThat which the Beotians call ærops[191] is the only bird that makes\r\nits nests in caverns in the earth. The cichlæ[192] make nests of mud\r\nlike swallows in the tops of trees; but they place them in order close\r\nto each other, so that from their proximity they look like a chain of\r\nnests. Among the birds which make solitary nests, the hoopoe makes no\r\nreal nest, but lays its eggs in the stumps of hollow trees, without\r\nbuilding at all. The coccyx[193] lays its eggs in houses and holes in\r\nrocks. The tetrix, which the Athenians call \"urax,\" makes no nest on\r\nthe ground or in trees, but in herbaceous plants.\r\n\r\n[191] Merops apiaster.\r\n\r\n[192] Turdus, thrush.\r\n\r\n[193] Cuculus canorus.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n1. The eggs of all birds are alike and have a hard shell, if they are\r\nproduced by sexual intercourse and are not decayed, for domestic fowls\r\nsometimes lay soft eggs. Birds' eggs are two-coloured, externally\r\nwhite, internally yellow. The eggs of birds inhabiting the sides of\r\nstreams and lakes differ from those living on dry land, for in the eggs\r\nof aquatic birds the yolk bears a much larger proportion to the white.\r\n\r\n2. The colours of eggs vary in different kinds of birds. Some have\r\nwhite eggs, as pigeons, partridges; some yellow, as those inhabiting\r\nstreams; others are spotted, as those of the meleagris[194] and\r\nphasianus;[195] the eggs of the cenchris are red like vermilion. In the\r\negg itself there is a difference; for one end is pointed, the other\r\nround. The round end is produced first. The large, sharp eggs are\r\nmales; those which are round and circular at the sharp end are females.\r\n\r\n[194] Numida Meleagris.\r\n\r\n[195] Phasianus colchicus.\r\n\r\n3. They are matured by incubation. Some are hatched spontaneously in\r\nthe earth, as in Egypt, being buried in dung; and they say that in\r\nSyracuse a drunkard placed eggs beneath his mat, and drank without\r\nceasing until the eggs were hatched; and eggs placed in warm vessels\r\nhave been matured and hatched spontaneously.\r\n\r\n4. The seminal fluid of all birds is white, like that of other animals;\r\nand when they copulate the female receives the male semen near the\r\ndiaphragm. The egg at first appears small and white, afterwards red\r\nand bloody; as it grows it becomes quite ochreous and yellow; when it\r\nbecomes larger a distinction is made, and the internal part becomes\r\nyellow, the external white; and when it is perfected it is set at\r\nliberty, and excluded just at the period when it is changing from soft\r\nto hard. So that during exclusion it is not hardened; but as soon as\r\nit is excluded it thickens and becomes hard, unless it is diseased. And\r\neggs have been known to be excluded in the state in which all eggs are\r\nat a certain period of their growth; for they were entirely yellow,\r\nas the young bird is afterwards. Such have also been observed in the\r\ndomestic fowl beneath the diaphragm, where the eggs of the hen are\r\nplaced, entirely yellow, and as large as eggs usually are. This has\r\nbeen considered ominous.\r\n\r\n5. They are mistaken who say that the hypenemia (barren eggs) are the\r\nremains of former acts of sexual intercourse; for young birds, as fowls\r\nand geese, have been frequently observed to lay such eggs without any\r\nsexual intercourse. Barren eggs are smaller, not so sweet, and more\r\nfluid than fertile eggs, and they are more numerous. If they are placed\r\nunder a bird, the fluid part never thickens, but both the yolk and\r\nthe white remain in their original state. Many birds produce these\r\neggs, as the domestic fowl, partridge, pigeon, peafowl, goose, and\r\nchenalopex.[196]\r\n\r\n[196] Œnas tadorna.\r\n\r\n6. Eggs are hatched more readily in summer than in winter; for in the\r\nsummer the domestic fowl will hatch in eighteen days, but in winter\r\nsometimes in not less than twenty-five days. Some birds also are more\r\nadapted for incubation than others. A thunder-storm during the season\r\nof incubation will destroy the eggs. What are called cynosura and\r\nuria (addled eggs) are more frequently produced in the summer. The\r\nhypenemia[197] are by some persons called zephyria, because they say\r\nthat birds receive these winds in the spring. They do the same thing if\r\nthey are touched with the hand. The hypenemia become fertile; and eggs\r\nthat are produced by sexual intercourse are changed to another kind,\r\nif the hen which contains either hypenemia or fertile eggs has sexual\r\nintercourse with another bird before the eggs begin to change from\r\nyellow to white, and the hypenemia become fertile, and the fertile eggs\r\nproduce birds of the nature of the second male.\r\n\r\n[197] Eggs formed without sexual intercourse.\r\n\r\n7. But if the change from yellow to white has already taken place,\r\nneither the barren nor the fertile eggs are altered, so as to change to\r\nthe nature of the second male. And if the sexual intercourse should be\r\ndiscontinued while the eggs are small, those which existed previously\r\nundergo no change, but if the act is repeated, a rapid increase in\r\nsize takes place. The nature of the white and yolk of the egg is\r\ndifferent, not only in colour, but in other properties, for the yolk\r\ncoagulates with cold, while the white remains fluid, but the white\r\ncoagulates with heat, which the yolk does not, but remains soft, if it\r\nis not burnt; and it becomes consistent and dry by boiling rather than\r\nroasting.\r\n\r\n8. The white and yolk are separated from each other by a membrane.\r\nThe chalazæ at the extremities of the yolk have nothing to do with\r\ngeneration, as some persons suppose. These spots are two, one below\r\nand one above. If many whites and yolks of eggs are taken out, and\r\nmixed together in a vessel, and cooked with a slow and moderate heat,\r\nthe yolks will all collect in the middle, and the whites will surround\r\nthem. Young domestic fowls begin to lay eggs at the beginning of the\r\nspring; they lay more than those which are older, but those of the\r\nyoung birds are smaller, and if birds are not permitted to incubate,\r\nthey are destroyed and become sick.\r\n\r\n9. After copulation birds ruffle and shake themselves, and often cover\r\nthemselves with chaff, and this also they do when they have laid.\r\nPigeons draw up their tail, geese go and bathe. The pregnancy and\r\nconception of barren eggs is quick in most birds, as in the partridge,\r\non account of the violence of their sexual desires; for if the hen\r\nstands in the way of the breath of the male, she conceives, and\r\nimmediately becomes of no use for fowling; for the partridge appears to\r\nhave a very distinct smell. The production of the egg after copulation,\r\nand the production of the young by incubation, do not occupy the same\r\nlength of time in all birds, but varies according to their size.\r\nThe egg of the domestic fowl is perfected in ten days after sexual\r\nintercourse, and that of the pigeon in a shorter time. Pigeons are\r\nable to retain their eggs even in the act of parturition. If they are\r\ndisturbed by anything occurring in the neighbourhood of their nest,\r\nor a feather be plucked out, or if anything else troubles or disturbs\r\nthem, they retain the egg they were about to lay.\r\n\r\n10. This is peculiar to pigeons, and so is the following: for they\r\nkiss each other when the male is about to mount, or else they will not\r\nendure it. The older bird first gives a kiss, but afterwards he mounts\r\nwithout kissing, but younger birds always kiss before copulation.\r\nThis also is peculiar to these birds. The females kiss and mount upon\r\neach other like the males, when there is no male present. They do not\r\nproject anything into each other, but produce more eggs than those\r\nwhich produce fertile ones; from these eggs nothing is hatched, but\r\nthey are all barren.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n1. The production of the bird from the egg is alike in them all, but\r\nthe period of completion varies, as I observed before. In domestic\r\nfowls the first sign of alteration takes place after three days and\r\nnights. This period is longer in larger birds, and shorter in small\r\nbirds. During this period the upper part of the yolk advances to the\r\nsmall extremity of the egg, which is the beginning of the egg. This is\r\nthe part from which the chicken is excluded, and the heart is visible\r\nlike a red spot in the white of the egg.\r\n\r\n2. This spot palpitates and moves as though it were endued with life.\r\nFrom this, as it increases, two involved sanguineous passages like\r\nveins lead to each of the surrounding tunics; and a membrane which has\r\nsanguineous passages encloses the white at this period, and separates\r\nit from the venous passages. A short time afterwards the body is\r\ndistinguished, at first very small and white, but the head is distinct,\r\nand in this the eyes are the most enlarged. And this continues for some\r\ntime, for afterwards the eyes are reduced in size and approach each\r\nother, but the lower part of the body has not at first any proportion\r\nto the upper part.\r\n\r\n3. One of the passages from the heart extends into a circle around the\r\nembryo, and the other to the yolk, as if it were an umbilical cord.\r\nThe origin of the young bird is in the white, its nutriment is derived\r\nfrom the yolk through the umbilical cord. On the tenth day, the whole\r\nof the young bird and all its parts are distinct, but its head is still\r\nlarger than the rest of the body, and the eyes are larger than the rest\r\nof the head. They have no sense of sight. If the eyes are taken out at\r\nthis period, they are larger than beans, and black; when the skin is\r\ntaken from them, they are seen to contain a white and cold fluid, very\r\nbrilliant in appearance, but without any hard substance. This is the\r\nmanner of the development of the eyes and head.\r\n\r\n4. At the same period the viscera are visible, but the stomach, and\r\nintestines, and the veins from the heart still appear to extend towards\r\nthe navel. From the navel a vein appears to extend upon the membrane\r\nwhich encloses the yolk, and the yolk itself is at this period fluid,\r\nand more abundant than in its natural state. The other extends to the\r\nmembrane which encloses the whole membrane containing the embryo, and\r\nthe membrane of the yolk and the fluid between them, and when the young\r\nbirds have grown a little more, part of the yolk goes to one end, and\r\npart to the other, and between them is the fluid white; but the white\r\nis still below the lower part of the yolk, where it was at first, but\r\nat the tenth day the white disappears, for it has become small, viscid,\r\nthick, and rather yellow.\r\n\r\n5. This is the position of all the parts: the first and last part\r\nadjoining the shell is the membrane of the egg, not the membrane of\r\nthe shell, but beneath this. This contains the fluid white; within\r\nthis is the young bird, and a membrane surrounding it, and separating\r\nit from the fluid; beneath the embryo is the yolk, to which one of the\r\nveins extends, and the other to the white which encloses it. A membrane\r\ncontaining a fluid resembling sanies encloses the whole, and then\r\nanother membrane which surrounds the embryo itself, as I observed, and\r\nseparates it from the fluid. Below this the yolk, enclosed in another\r\nmembrane, which is reached by the umbilical cord from the heart, and\r\nthe great vein, so that the embryo does not appear to be in either of\r\nthe fluids.\r\n\r\n6. About the twentieth day, if the hatching has been delayed beyond\r\nthis period, the young bird is able to chirp when moved externally, and\r\nif the shell is taken off, by this time also it is downy. The head is\r\nplaced over the right leg upon the side, and the wing is over the head.\r\nAt this period the chorion-like membrane is visible, which is united\r\nwith the lowest membrane of the shell, to which one of the umbilical\r\ncords passes, and the young bird is complete. The other chorion-like\r\nmembrane is also visible, enclosing the yolk. To this the other\r\numbilical cord extends. Both of these cords are attached to the heart\r\nand the great vein. At the same period the cord which is attached to\r\none chorion falls off, and is separated from the animal, but the one\r\nwhich passes to the yolk remains suspended from the young bird by a\r\nthin bowel, and a considerable portion of the yolk is contained in the\r\nyoung bird, and some of it is found in the stomach.\r\n\r\n7. At this period also they eject an excrementitious matter into\r\nthe external chorion, and contain it in the stomach. The external\r\nexcrement is white, the internal yellow. At last the yolk, which has\r\nbeen continually wasting and advancing, is entirely taken up and\r\nenclosed in the young bird. So that portions of it may be observed in\r\nthe intestines of birds if they are dissected on the tenth day after\r\nexclusion from the egg. But it is set at liberty from the navel, nor\r\ndoes any communication remain, but the whole is separated. About the\r\nbefore-mentioned period the young bird sleeps, but it stirs itself, and\r\nlooks up, and chirps when it is touched, and the heart swells up with\r\nthe navel, as if the embryo were breathing. This is the manner of the\r\ndevelopment of the chick in the egg.\r\n\r\n8. Birds also produce some barren eggs, as well as those from sexual\r\nintercourse, but they produce nothing after incubation. This is\r\nparticularly observed in pigeons. Double eggs have two yolks; in some a\r\nthin division of white prevents the yolks from mixing together; others\r\nhave not this division, but touch each other. There are some hens which\r\nalways lay double eggs, and in these the peculiarities of the yolks\r\nhave been observed; for a certain bird having laid eighteen eggs,\r\nhatched two chickens from each of them, except those that were addled;\r\nall the rest were productive, except that one of the twin chickens was\r\nlarge and the other small in each. The last, however, was monstrous.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n1. All the pigeon tribe, as the phatta and trygon, generally produce\r\ntwo eggs; the trygon and the phatta are those which generally lay\r\nthree. The pigeon lays, as I said, at every season; the trygon and\r\nthe phatta in the spring, and not more than twice. The second brood\r\nare hatched when the first has been destroyed, for many birds destroy\r\nthem. It sometimes lays three, as I have said, but it never brings out\r\nmore than two young ones, and sometimes only one, the remaining egg\r\nis always addled. Very few birds begin to lay before they are a year\r\nold; but when they have once begun to lay, they all, as we may say,\r\nnaturally contain eggs to the end of their life, though it is not easy\r\nto see them in some birds, from their small size.\r\n\r\n2. The pigeon usually produces one male and one female, and of these\r\nthe male is often hatched first; and having laid an egg one day, she\r\nomits many days and then lays another. The male sits during a portion\r\nof the day, and the female during the night. The first young one is\r\nhatched and able to fly within twenty days, and the egg is billed on\r\nthe day before it is hatched; both the old birds keep the young ones\r\nwarm for some time, as they do the eggs. During the time of bringing up\r\ntheir young the female is fiercer than the male: this is also the case\r\nin other animals. They produce young ten times in a year, and sometimes\r\neleven times; those in Egypt even twelve times. The cock and hen birds\r\ncopulate within the year, for they do this at the end of six months.\r\n\r\n3. And some say that the phatta and trygon are matured when three\r\nmonths old, and they consider their great numbers as a proof of this.\r\nThe female contains her eggs fourteen days, and then sits upon them\r\nfourteen more; in fourteen days after this the young ones fly so well\r\nthat it is difficult to catch them. The phatta lives, as they say,\r\nforty years; the partridge more than sixteen years. The pigeon, after\r\nhaving brought out her young, lays again in thirty days.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n1. The vulture builds its nest in inaccessible rocks, wherefore its\r\nnest and young ones are rarely seen. For this reason Herodorus, the\r\nfather of Bryson the sophist, says that vultures come from another part\r\nof the earth, which is invisible to us, giving as a reason for his\r\nopinion, that they are seen in great numbers suddenly following the\r\npath of an army. But difficult as it is to observe them, their nests\r\nhave been seen. The vulture produces two eggs. No other carnivorous\r\nbird has been observed to produce young more than once a year; but\r\nthe swallow more frequently produces young twice a year than the\r\ncarnivorous birds. If a person pierces the eyes of young swallows they\r\nrecover, and are able to see afterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n1. The eagle produces three eggs, of which two only are hatched. This\r\nis also related in the poems of Musæus. The bird which lays three eggs,\r\nhatches two, and brings up but one. This frequently happens; but three\r\nyoung have been seen in the nest. When the young begin to grow, one of\r\nthem is turned out by the parent, because she dislikes the trouble of\r\nfeeding it. At this period it is said to be without food, so that it\r\ndoes not capture the young of wild creatures, for a few days the talons\r\nare turned back, and the feathers become white, so that it then becomes\r\ncruel to its young. The phene[198] receives and brings up the ejected\r\nyoung one.\r\n\r\n[198] Vultur cinereus, ossifragus, osprey.\r\n\r\n2. The eagle incubates for thirty days; this is the usual period of\r\nincubation for large birds, as the goose and the bustard. Moderately\r\nsized birds usually sit twenty days, as the ictinus[199] and\r\nhierax.[200] The ictinus usually produces two young ones, and sometimes\r\nthree; the Ætolian kite, as it is called, sometimes produces four. The\r\nraven produces not only two, but, as they say, many eggs, which she\r\nsits upon for about twenty days. She also turns out some of her young\r\nones. Many other birds do the same thing; and generally those which\r\nproduce several turn out one.\r\n\r\n[199] Kite.\r\n\r\n[200] Hawk.\r\n\r\n3. All kinds of eagles do not behave in the same way to their young;\r\nbut the pygargus is cruel; and the black eagles are careful for the\r\nfood of their young; but all birds with crooked talons as soon as their\r\nyoung can fly well beat them and drive them from the nest. And most\r\nbirds of other classes, as I have before observed, do the same thing;\r\nand when they have brought them up, they take no more notice of them,\r\nexcept the crow. This bird cares for its young a long while, for as it\r\nflies past them it gives them food after they are able to fly.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n1. The cuckoo is said by some persons to be a changed hawk, because the\r\nhawk which it resembles disappears when the cuckoo comes, and indeed\r\nvery few hawks of any sort can be seen during the period in which the\r\ncuckoo is singing except for a few days. The cuckoo is seen for a\r\nshort time in the summer, and disappears in winter. But the hawk has\r\ncrooked talons, which the cuckoo has not, nor does it resemble the hawk\r\nin the form of its head, but in both these respects is more like the\r\npigeon than the hawk, which it resembles in nothing but its colour; the\r\nmarkings, however, upon the hawk are like lines, while the cuckoo is\r\nspotted.\r\n\r\n2. Its size and manner of flight is like that of the smallest kind of\r\nhawk, which generally disappears during the season in which the cuckoo\r\nis seen. But they have both been seen at the same time, and the cuckoo\r\nwas being devoured by the hawk, though this is never done by birds of\r\nthe same kind. They say that no one has ever seen the young of the\r\ncuckoo. It does, however, lay eggs, but it makes no nest; but sometimes\r\nit lays its eggs in the nests of small birds, and devours their eggs,\r\nespecially in the nests of the pigeon, when it has eaten their eggs.\r\nSometimes it lays two, but usually only one egg; it lays also in the\r\nnest of the hypolais,[201] which hatches and brings it up. At this\r\nseason it is particularly fat and sweet-fleshed; the flesh also of\r\nyoung hawks is very sweet and fat. There is also a kind of them which\r\nbuilds a nest in precipitous cliffs.\r\n\r\n[201] Sylvia curucca, hedge sparrow.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n1. In many birds the male alternates with the female in the duty of\r\nincubation, as we observed in speaking of pigeons, and takes her place\r\nwhile she is obliged to procure food for herself. In geese the female\r\nalone sits upon the eggs, and having once begun, she never leaves them\r\nduring the whole process of incubation. The nests of all water birds\r\nare situated in marshy and grassy places, by which means they can keep\r\nquiet and still have food within their reach, so that they do not\r\nstarve all the while. The females alone, among the crows, sit on the\r\neggs, which they never leave; but the males bring them food and feed\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n2. The females of the pigeons begin to sit at twilight, and remain on\r\nthe nest the whole night, till dawn; and the male the rest of the time.\r\nPartridges make two nests of eggs, upon one of which the male sits, on\r\nthe other the female; and each of them hatches and brings up its own:\r\nand the male has sexual intercourse with its young as soon as they are\r\nhatched.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n1. The peacock lives about twenty-five years, and produces young\r\ngenerally at three years old; by which time also they have obtained\r\ntheir variegated plumage: and it hatches in thirty days, or rather\r\nmore. It only produces young once a-year, laying twelve eggs, or not\r\nquite so many. It lays its eggs at intervals of two or three days,\r\nand not regularly. At first they lay only eight. The pea-fowl also\r\nlays barren eggs: they copulate in the spring, and lay their eggs\r\nimmediately afterwards.\r\n\r\n2. This bird sheds its feathers when the leaves of the trees begin\r\nto fall, and begins to acquire them again with the first budding in\r\nthe spring. Those who rear these birds place the eggs for incubation\r\nbeneath domestic fowls; because the peacock flies at, and torments the\r\nhen when she is sitting; for which reason some of the wild birds make\r\ntheir escape from the males before they begin to lay and sit. They\r\nplace only two eggs under domestic fowls, for these are all that they\r\ncan hatch and bring out; and they take care to put food before them,\r\nthat they may not get up and desert their incubation.\r\n\r\n3. Birds at the season of sexual intercourse have large testicles. In\r\nthe more lascivious they are always more evident, as the domestic cock\r\nand the partridge. In those that are not always lascivious, they are\r\nless. This is the manner of the gestation and reproduction of birds.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n1. It has been already observed that fish are not always oviparous,\r\nfor the selache are always viviparous. All the rest are oviparous. The\r\nselache are viviparous, having first of all produced ova internally;\r\nand these they bring up in themselves, except the batrachus. Fish\r\nhave also, as I observed before, very different uteri in different\r\nkinds: for in the oviparous genera the uterus is double, and situated\r\nlow down. In the selache the uterus is more like that of birds. There\r\nis this difference, however, that the ova are not placed near the\r\ndiaphragm, but in an intermediate position near the spine; and when\r\nthey have grown they change their place from this part. The ovum in\r\nall fish is not of two, but of one colour; and it is more white than\r\nyellow, both in its early stages, and after the formation of the embryo.\r\n\r\n2. The development of the ovum is different in fish and in birds, in\r\nthat it has not the umbilical cord which passes to the membrane of the\r\nshell; but only the passage which leads to the yolk in the eggs of\r\nbirds. The rest of the development of the ovum is alike in birds and\r\nfish; for it takes place at the extremity, and the veins have their\r\norigin in a similar manner in the heart; and the head, and eyes, and\r\nupper parts of the body are larger than the rest. As the young fish\r\nincreases, the ovum continues to diminish, and at last it disappears,\r\nand is absorbed, like the yolk in the eggs of birds. The umbilical cord\r\nis attached a little below the abdomen. At first the cord is long, but\r\nit becomes less as the fish grows, and at last is small, and finally\r\nabsorbed, like that of birds.\r\n\r\n3. The embryo and the ovum are enclosed in a common membrane, and\r\nbeneath this there is another membrane, in which the embryo alone is\r\nenclosed. Between these membranes there is a fluid substance. The\r\nnutriment contained in the stomach of the young fish is similar to\r\nthat in the young birds, partly white, and partly yellow. The form of\r\nthe uterus must be learned from dissection. This organ is different\r\nin different fish, as in the galeode by themselves, and the flat fish\r\nby themselves: for in some the ova are attached near the spine to the\r\ncentre of the uterus, as I observed before, as in scylia.[202] They\r\ndescend when they begin to increase, when the uterus is double, and are\r\nattached to the diaphragm, as in other fish: the ova descend into each\r\ndivision.\r\n\r\n[202] Dog-fish. Squalus stellaris.\r\n\r\n4. The uterus of these fish, and of the other galeode, has a small\r\nappendage attached to the diaphragm like a white nipple, which is not\r\npresent unless they are pregnant. The scylia and the batis have a\r\nshell-like substance, which contains the fluid of the ovum. In form the\r\nshell resembles the tongue of a wind instrument, and hair-like passages\r\nare attached to the shells. The young of the scylia, which some persons\r\ncall nebria galei, are born when the shell falls off and bursts. The\r\nyoung of the batis when they are brought forth are excluded by the\r\nrupture of the shell. In the acantheas[203] galeos the ova are attached\r\nto the diaphragm above the nipples; and when the ovum descends, the\r\nyoung is attached to it after it is set free. The reproduction of the\r\nalopex is in the same manner.\r\n\r\n[203] Squalus Acanthias.\r\n\r\n5. Most galei which are called smooth have the ova placed between the\r\ndivisions of the uterus, like those of the scylia; and as they surround\r\nit, they descend into each division of the uterus, and they are\r\nproduced, attached to the uterus by an umbilical cord; so that when the\r\nova are taken out, they appear similar to the embryo of quadrupeds. And\r\nthe long umbilical cord is attached to the lower part of the uterus,\r\neach part, as it were, attached to an acetabulum; and to the middle of\r\nthe embryo near the liver. And when it is dissected, the food is like\r\nan egg, though the ovum be no longer there. There is a chorion, and\r\npeculiar membranes surrounding each of the embryos, as in quadrupeds.\r\n\r\n6. The head of the embryo when it is just produced, is upwards; but as\r\nit grows and reaches maturity, it is placed downwards. The males are\r\nplaced on the left, and the females on the right, or there are males\r\nand females together on the same side. The embryo, when dissected,\r\nresembles that of quadrupeds, in having its viscera such as it has, as\r\nthe liver, large, and full of blood. In all the selache the ova are\r\nplaced high up, near the diaphragm; many larger, and many smaller: and\r\nthe embryos are placed below, wherefore it is probable that such fish\r\nproduce their young, and copulate frequently during the same month, for\r\nthey do not produce all their young at once, but frequently, and for\r\na long while; but those that are in the lower part of the uterus are\r\nmatured and brought to perfection.\r\n\r\n7. The other galei both emit and receive their young into themselves,\r\nand so do the rhine and the narca; and a large narca has been observed\r\nto contain eighty young in herself. The acanthias is the only one of\r\nthe galei which does not admit its young into itself, on account of\r\ntheir thorns. Among the flat fish the trygon and batos do not admit\r\ntheir young, on account of the roughness of the tail. Neither does\r\nthe batrachus admit its young, on account of the size of their heads,\r\nand their thorns; and this is the only one that is not viviparous, as\r\nI previously observed. These are their mutual differences, and the\r\nmanner of the development of their ova.\r\n\r\n8. At the season of sexual intercourse, the seminal ducts of the\r\nmale are full of fluid, so that a white matter escapes when they are\r\npressed. These passages are divided, and originate in the diaphragm\r\nand the large vein: at the same season the passages of the male are\r\nconspicuous, and may be compared with the uterus of the female. When\r\nit is not the season of sexual intercourse, they are less conspicuous,\r\nfrom not being in use. In some fish, and sometimes, they are not\r\nvisible at all, as it was remarked of the testicles of birds. The\r\nseminal and uterine passages are different in other respects also,\r\nand because those of the male are attached to the loins, those of the\r\nfemale are easily moved, and enclosed in a thin membrane. The nature of\r\nthe passages of the male may be seen in works on anatomy.\r\n\r\n9. The selachea become pregnant again while with young, and the period\r\nof gestation is six months. Among the galei, the asterias produces\r\nyoung the oftenest; for it produces twice in a month: it begins to\r\ncopulate in the month of September. All the other galei except the\r\nscylia produce twice in the year; the scylia but once. Some of them\r\nhave their young in the spring. The rhine produces its first brood in\r\nthe spring, and its last in the autumn, near the winter season, and\r\nthe setting of the Pleiades. The second fry are the most numerous. The\r\nnarca produces its young in the autumn. The selache descend from the\r\nocean and deep water to the shore, to produce their young, both for the\r\nsake of the warmth, and care of their offspring.\r\n\r\n10. No other fish but the rhine and the batos have ever been observed\r\nto unite with others not of their own kind, but there is a fish called\r\nthe rhinobatus, which has the head and upper part of the rhine, and\r\nthe lower part like the batus, as it were made up of both. The galei\r\nand the galeoeides, as the alopex, dog-fish, and the flat fish, as the\r\nnarce batos, leiobatos and trygon, are in this manner ovoviparous.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n1. The dolphin, whale, and other cetacea which have a blow-hole but no\r\ngills, are viviparous, and so are the pristis and the bos. For none\r\nof these have an ovum, but a proper fœtus, from which, when perfected,\r\nan animal is developed, as in man and the viviparous quadrupeds. The\r\ndolphin usually produces one, and sometimes two young ones. The whale\r\ngenerally and usually produces two and sometimes one. The phocæna is\r\nsimilar to the dolphin, for it is like a small dolphin. It is produced\r\nin the Pontus. In some respects the phocæna differs from the dolphin,\r\nfor its size is smaller, it is wider in the back, and its colour is\r\nblue. Many persons say that the phocæna is a kind of dolphin.\r\n\r\n2. All these creatures which have a blow-hole, breathe and inhale\r\nair; and the dolphin has been observed while asleep with the muzzle\r\nabove the water, and it snores in its sleep. The dolphin and phocæna\r\ngive milk and suckle their young. They also receive their young into\r\nthemselves. The growth of the young dolphins is rapid, for they attain\r\ntheir full size in ten years. The female is pregnant for ten months.\r\nThe dolphin produces her young in the summer-time, and at no other\r\nseason. They seem also to disappear for thirty days during the season\r\nof the dog-star. The young follow their dam for a long while, and it is\r\nan animal much attached to its offspring. It lives many years; for some\r\nhave been known to live twenty-five or thirty years; for fishermen have\r\nmarked them by cutting their tails and then giving them their liberty.\r\nIn this way their age was known.\r\n\r\n3. The seal is amphibious, for it does not inhale water, but breathes\r\nand sleeps. It produces its young on land, but near the shore, in the\r\nmanner of animals with feet; but it lives the greater part of its time,\r\nand obtains its food in the sea, wherefore it is to be considered among\r\naquatic animals. It is properly viviparous, and produces a living\r\ncreature, and a chorion, and it brings forth the other membranes like a\r\nsheep. It produces one or two, never more than three young ones. It has\r\nalso mammæ, so that it suckles its young like quadrupeds. It produces\r\nits young like the human subject, at all seasons of the year, but\r\nespecially with the earliest goats.\r\n\r\n4. When the young are twelve days old, it leads them to the water\r\nseveral times in the day, in order to habituate them by degrees. It\r\ndrags its hinder parts along, and does not walk, for it cannot erect\r\nitself upon its feet, but it contracts and draws itself together. It\r\nis fleshy and soft, and its bones are cartilaginous. It is difficult\r\nto kill the seal by violence, unless it is struck upon the temple, for\r\nits body is fleshy. It has a voice like an ox. The pudendum of the\r\nfemale is like that of the batis, in all other animals of the class the\r\npudendum resembles that of the human female. This is the manner of the\r\ndevelopment and nature of the young of aquatic animals which are either\r\ninternally or externally viviparous.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n1. The oviparous fish have a divided uterus placed on the lower part of\r\nthe body, as I observed before. All that have scales are viviparous,\r\nas the labrax, cestreus, cephalus, etelis,[204] and those called white\r\nfish, and all smooth fish except the eel. Their ova resemble sand. This\r\nappearance is owing to their uterus being quite full of ova, so that\r\nsmall fish appear to have only two ova; for the small size and thinness\r\nof the uterus renders it invisible in these creatures. I have before\r\ntreated of the sexual intercourse of fish. The sexes are distinct in\r\nalmost all fish, though there is some doubt about the erythrinus[205]\r\nand the channa, for all these are found to be pregnant.\r\n\r\n[204] Perhaps the Sea-bream, Sparus.\r\n\r\n[205] Perhaps Perca marina.\r\n\r\n2. Ova are found in those fish which have sexual intercourse, though\r\nthey possess them without intercourse. This is observable in some kinds\r\nof river fish; for the phoxini[206] appear to be pregnant as soon as\r\nthey are born, and when they are quite small. They emit the ova in a\r\nstream; and, as I observed before, the males devour great numbers of\r\nthem, and others perish in the water. Those are preserved which they\r\ndeposit in their appropriate situations. For, if all were preserved,\r\nthe numbers that would be found would be immense. Not all those that\r\nare preserved are fertile, but only those on which the seminal fluid of\r\nthe male has been sprinkled. When the female produces her ova, the male\r\nfollows, and scatters his semen upon them. Young fish are produced from\r\nthose ova which are thus sprinkled. The remainder turn out as chance\r\nmay direct.\r\n\r\n[206] Cyprinus Phoxinus.\r\n\r\n3. The same thing also occurs in the malacia; for the male sepia\r\nsprinkles the ova of the female as they are deposited; and it is\r\nreasonable to suppose that the other malacia do the same, although it\r\nhas only been observed in the sepia. They produce their ova near the\r\nland, the cobii deposit them upon stones, and that which they produce\r\nis flat and sand-like. The rest do the same, for the parts near the\r\nland are warmer, and provision is more abundant, and there is better\r\nprotection for their young against larger fish, for which cause very\r\ngreat numbers deposit their ova near the river Thermodon, in the\r\nPontus, for the place is sheltered and warm, and the water is sweet.\r\n\r\n4. The majority of viviparous fish reproduce once in a-year, except\r\nthe small phycides,[207] which reproduce twice a-year. The male phyces\r\ndiffers from the female, being darker-coloured and having larger\r\nscales. All other fish produce from seed, and emit ova; but that which\r\nis called the belone, at the season of reproduction bursts asunder, and\r\nin this way the ova escape; for this fish has a division beneath the\r\nstomach and bowels, like the serpents called typhlinæ.[208] When it has\r\nproduced its ova, it survives, and the wound heals up again.\r\n\r\n[207] Mugil. Some species of mullet.\r\n\r\n[208] Lacerta apus.\r\n\r\n5. The development of the ovum is alike, both in those that are\r\ninternally and those that are externally oviparous. For it takes\r\nplace at the extremity of the ovum, and it is enclosed in a membrane.\r\nThe eyes are the first part that is conspicuous; they are large and\r\nspherical; so that it is plain that they are mistaken who say that\r\nthe mode of development resembles that of vermiform creatures, for in\r\nthem the order is different, and the lower parts are formed first, and\r\nafterwards the head and eyes. When the ovum is taken away, they assume\r\na circular form, and for some time continue to grow without taking in\r\nany food, by absorbing the moisture of the ovum. They afterwards derive\r\ntheir nutriment, as long as they continue growing, from the water of\r\nthe river.\r\n\r\n6. When the Pontus is cleansed, something is floated out into the\r\nHellespont which is called fucus. It is of a yellow colour. Some say\r\nthat it is naturally a plant. This takes place at the beginning of\r\nsummer. The oysters and small fish which live in these places feed\r\nupon this fucus; and some maritime persons say that they obtain their\r\npurple from this plant.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n1. The pond and river fish begin to reproduce usually when five months\r\nold. They all produce their ova at the beginning of summer. Like the\r\nmarine fish, the females of these kinds never emit all their ova, nor\r\nthe males all their semen, at once; but both sexes are always found to\r\ncontain a portion of the reproductive substance; they produce their\r\nova at the proper season. The cyprinus five or six times a-year, and\r\nespecially under the influence of the stars. The chalcis reproduces\r\nthree times, all the rest but once a-year.\r\n\r\n2. They deposit their ova in the stagnant parts of rivers and ponds\r\namong the reeds, as the phoxinus and perca. The glanis and the\r\nperca produce their ova in strings, like the frog. That which the\r\nperca produces is so involved that, on account of its breadth, the\r\nfishermen collect it together from among the reeds in ponds. The\r\nlarger individuals of the glanis produce their ova in deep water, some\r\nwhere it is a fathom deep; but the smaller ones in shallow water, and\r\nespecially at the root of the willow or some other tree, and among the\r\nreeds and mosses.\r\n\r\n3. The fish fold themselves together, sometimes a large one with a\r\nsmall one, and approximate the passages, which some call their navel,\r\nfrom which they eject their respective seminal matter, the females\r\ntheir ova, and the males their spermatic fluid. Those ova with which\r\nthe semen of the male has been mixed immediately or in the course of a\r\nday become whiter and larger, and in a short time the eyes of the fish\r\nmake their appearance; for in all fish, as in other animals, this part\r\nis most conspicuous, and appears the largest. But, if the seminal fluid\r\ndoes not touch any of the ova, as in the case of sea-fish, these become\r\nuseless and barren.\r\n\r\n4. From the fertile ova, as the fish increase in size, something like a\r\nshell is separated; this is the membrane which envelopes the ovum and\r\nthe embryo fish. As soon as the seminal fluid is mixed with the ova a\r\nglutinous matter is formed, which fastens them to the roots or other\r\nsubstance on which they are deposited. The male watches over the place\r\nwhere the greatest number of ova are deposited, and the female departs\r\nas soon as she has spawned. The development of the ovum of the glanis\r\nproceeds the most slowly, for the male remains by them for forty or\r\nfifty days, in order that they may not be devoured by fish chancing to\r\ncome that way.\r\n\r\n5. Next to this is the cyprinus. The ova, however, of these which\r\nare preserved escape very quickly. The development in some of the\r\nsmall fish takes place on the third day, and the ova upon which the\r\nseminal fluid has fallen begin to increase on the same day, or shortly\r\nafterwards. The ova of the glanis become as large as the seed of the\r\norobus. Those of the cyprinus and that class, about the size of millet.\r\nThe ova of these fish are produced and developed in this manner.\r\n\r\n6. The chalcis assembles in great numbers to deposit its ova in deep\r\nwater. The fish which is called tilon deposits its ova near the shore,\r\nin sheltered places; this fish also is gregarious. The cyprinus,\r\nbalerus, and all others, so to say, hasten into shallow water to\r\ndeposit their ova, and thirteen or fourteen males often follow a single\r\nfemale, and when the female has deposited her ova and departed, the\r\nmales that follow her sprinkle their semen upon them. The majority of\r\nthe ova are lost, for the female scatters them abroad as she is moving\r\nforward, unless they fall upon any substance, and are not carried away\r\nby the stream. None of them, except the glanis, watch their ova, unless\r\nthe cyprinus meets with them in great numbers, when, they say, that\r\nthis fish watches them.\r\n\r\n7. All the male fish have semen, except the eel, and this one has\r\nneither semen nor ova. The cestreus migrates from the sea into lakes\r\nand rivers; the eel, on the contrary, leaves them for the sea. Most\r\nfish, therefore, as I observed, proceed from ova.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n1. Some originate in mud and sand: even of those kinds which originate\r\nin sexual intercourse and ova, some, they say, have appeared both\r\nin other marshy places and in those which once surrounded Cnidus,\r\nwhich became dry under the influence of the dog-star, and all the mud\r\nwas parched up, but with the first rains the waters returned, and\r\nsmall fish appeared with the return of the waters. This was a kind\r\nof cestreus, which originates in coition, about the size of small\r\nmænidia,[209] but they had neither ova nor semen. In the Asiatic\r\nrivers, which do not flow into the sea, other small fish, of the size\r\nof epseti,[210] are produced in the same manner. Some persons say that\r\nthe cestreus is always produced in this manner, but in this they are\r\nmistaken, for both the females are known to have ova and the males\r\nsemen. But there is some one kind of them which originates in mud and\r\nsand.\r\n\r\n[209] Sardine.\r\n\r\n[210] Atherine epsetos.\r\n\r\n2. It is evident from the following considerations that some of them\r\nare of spontaneous growth, and do not originate either in ova or semen.\r\nThose which are neither oviparous nor viviparous are all produced\r\neither from mud or sand, or from the putrid matter on the surface, as\r\nalso the foam in sandy places produces the aphya.[211] This aphya never\r\nincreases in size, and is barren, and as time advances it perishes, and\r\nanother fry is formed. Wherefore it may be said to be reproduced at\r\nevery season, except for a short time; for it continues from the autumn\r\narcturus to the spring. This is a proof that it sometimes originates\r\nin the soil, for it is not captured by fishermen in cold weather, but\r\non a fine day it may be taken as it comes up from the ground for the\r\nsake of the warmth. When they have dragged the ground and scraped up\r\nthe surface, the fish are more numerous and better. The other aphyæ are\r\ninferior, on account of their rapid growth.\r\n\r\n[211] Melanurus juvenculus.\r\n\r\n3. They are found in shady and marshy places, when the earth becomes\r\nwarm in fine weather, as near the temple of Athene in Salamis, and near\r\nthe tomb of Themistocles, and near Marathon, for foam is formed in\r\nall these places. It makes its appearance in such places, and in fine\r\nweather: it appears also at times in seasons of much rain, and when\r\nfoam is formed of rain water, wherefore also it is called aphrus; and\r\nsometimes it is found on the surface of the sea, in fine weather, where\r\nit is whirled about, and, like the little maggots in dung, so this is\r\nfound in the foam which floats on the surface; wherefore also this\r\naphya is carried by the sea in many directions, and it abounds and is\r\ncaptured in the greatest abundance when the season is moist and warm.\r\n\r\n4. There is another aphya derived from fish, for that which is\r\ncalled cobitis is derived from small and inferior gobii, which bury\r\nthemselves in the earth. The membrades are produced from the phalerica.\r\nThe trichides come from these, and the trichiæ from the trichides; from\r\none kind of aphya, which inhabits the port of Athens, the encrasicoli\r\nare derived. There is another kind of aphya which originates in the\r\nmœnis and cestreus, but the barren aphrus is very soft, and endures\r\nonly for a short time, as I said before, and at last nothing is left\r\nbut the head and eyes. The fishermen, however, have now found a mode of\r\nconveying it from place to place, for it lasts longer when salted.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n1. Eels are not produced from sexual intercourse, nor are they\r\noviparous, nor have they ever been detected with semen or ova, nor\r\nwhen dissected do they appear to possess either seminal or uterine\r\nviscera; and this is the only kind of sanguineous animal which does\r\nnot originate either in sexual intercourse or in ova. It is, however,\r\nmanifest that this is the case, for, after rain, they have been\r\nreproduced in some marshy ponds, from which all the water was drawn\r\nand the mud cleaned out; but they are never produced in dry places nor\r\nin ponds that are always full, for they live upon and are nourished by\r\nrain water. It is plain, therefore, that they are not produced either\r\nfrom sexual intercourse or from ova. Some persons have thought that\r\nthey were productive, because some eels have parasitical worms, and\r\nthey thought that these became eels.\r\n\r\n2. This, however, is not the case, but they originate in what are\r\ncalled the entrails of the earth, which are found spontaneously in\r\nmud and moist earth. They have been observed making their escape from\r\nthem, and others have been found in them when cut up and dissected.\r\nThese originate both in the sea and in rivers wherein putrid matter is\r\nabundant; in those places in the sea which are full of fuci, and near\r\nthe banks of rivers and ponds, for in these places the heat causes much\r\nputridity. This is the mode of generation in eels.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n1. The reproductive function is not active in all fish at the same time\r\nor the same manner, nor are they pregnant during the same length of\r\ntime. Before the season of sexual intercourse the males and females\r\nbegin to assemble, and at the period of intercourse and the production\r\nof their ova they pair together. Some of them do not remain pregnant\r\nmore than thirty days, and others not so long; but all of them remain\r\nso for a number of days, which can be distributed into seven. Those\r\nwhich some persons call marini remain pregnant for the longest period.\r\nThe sargus becomes pregnant in the month of December, and remains so\r\nfor thirty days. The kind of cestreus which some persons call the\r\nchelon and the myxon are pregnant at the same time as the sargus. All\r\nthese suffer in their pregnancy, wherefore they are driven to the shore\r\nat this season; for in the vehemence of their desire they are carried\r\ntowards the land, and always continue in motion during this period till\r\nthey have produced their ova. The cestreus is more remarkable for this\r\nthan any other fish. As soon as they have deposited their ova, they\r\nbecome quiet.\r\n\r\n2. In many fish there is a limit to their reproductive powers, when\r\nworms make their appearance in their abdomen. These worms are small\r\nliving creatures, which expel the reproductive substance. The small\r\nfry of the rhyas makes its appearance in the spring, and that of many\r\nothers about the vernal equinox. Other fish do not produce at this\r\nseason of the year, but in the summer or near the autumnal equinox.\r\n\r\n3. The atherina produces its young first of all, near the land. The\r\ncephalus is the last. This is evident from the small fry of the former\r\nappearing first, and that of the latter last of all. The cestreus also\r\nproduces among the first. The salpa in most places deposits its ova\r\nduring the summer, and sometimes in the autumn. The aulopias, which\r\nthey call anthias, produces its ova in the summer season. After these\r\nthe chrysophrys, labrax, mormyrus, and all those which are called\r\ndromades; the trigla and cocarinus are the latest of all the gregarious\r\nfish. These oviposit in the autumn. The trigla deposits her ova in the\r\nmud, which causes her to be late, for the mud continues cold for a long\r\nwhile. The coracimus is next to the trigla, and goes among the sea\r\nweed to deposit her ova: consequently they frequent rocky places. It\r\ncontinues pregnant for a long while. The mænides oviposit at the winter\r\nsolstice. Many other marine fish oviposit in the summer, for they are\r\nnot captured at this period. The mænis is the most productive of all\r\nfish, and the batrachus the most so among the selache. They are,\r\nhowever, rare, for they perish very readily; they oviposit in shoals\r\nand near the land.\r\n\r\n4. The selache, as being viviparous, are less productive. These are\r\nparticularly preserved by their large size. The belone is late in\r\nproducing its young, and many of them are burst by their ova in the act\r\nof parturition; for these ova are not so numerous as they are large.\r\nThey surround the parent as if they were phalangia; for she produces\r\nthem attached to herself, and if any one touches them they make their\r\nescape. The atherina deposits her ova by rubbing her abdomen against\r\nthe sand. The thynni burst with fat. They live two years. The fishermen\r\nargue thus: when the thynnides fail one year, the thynni fail the year\r\nafter. They appear to be a year older than the pelamus.\r\n\r\n5. The thynni and scombri copulate at the end of February, and produce\r\ntheir young at the beginning of June. They produce their ova, as it\r\nwere, in a purse. The growth of the thynnides is rapid; for when these\r\nfish produce their young in the Pontus, they produce from the ovum\r\ncreatures which some persons call scordylæ, and the Byzantines call\r\nauxidæ, because they grow in a few days. They go out in the autumn\r\nwith the thynnus, and return in the spring as pelamides. Nearly all\r\nother fish grow rapidly, but those in the Pontus more rapidly than in\r\nother places; for the amiæ there increase visibly every day. It is\r\nnecessary to remember that the same fish have not in the same place\r\nthe identical time of coition and gestation, nor the same period of\r\nreproduction and completion of their offspring. For those which are\r\ncalled coracini produce their ova at the time of wheat harvest, though,\r\ngenerally speaking, the order of their reproduction is that which I\r\nhave mentioned.\r\n\r\n6. The conger also becomes pregnant, though this circumstance is not\r\nequally distinct everywhere on account of its fat; for the organ of\r\nreproduction is long, like that of serpents. It becomes distinct,\r\nhowever, when laid upon the fire; for the fat smokes and consumes\r\naway, and the ova, when pressed, jump out with a cracking noise. If\r\nany person will feel and rub them with the finger, the fat will appear\r\nsmooth and the ova rough to the touch. Some congers have fat but no\r\nova; and others, on the contrary, have no fat but such ova as I have\r\ndescribed. We have now treated of nearly all the oviparous animals,\r\nwhether furnished with fins, or wings, or feet, and of their sexual\r\nintercourse, gestation, development, and such like subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n1. We must now treat of the nature of viviparous animals with feet\r\nand of man at this period. We have already treated in general and in\r\nparticular of their mode of coition. It is common to all animals to\r\nbe elevated with the desire and pleasure of sexual intercourse. The\r\nfemales become savage when their young are produced, the males at the\r\nseason of coition; for horses bite each other and drive about and\r\npursue their riders. The wild boars are very savage at this season,\r\nalthough coition renders them weak.\r\n\r\n2. And they fight wonderfully among themselves, and make themselves\r\nas it were breastplates, and render their skin callous beforehand by\r\nrubbing themselves against trees and frequently wallowing in the mud\r\nand drying themselves. They fight together and drive each other out of\r\nthe herd so fiercely, that not rarely both of them perish in the fight.\r\nThe same is the nature of bulls, rams, and goats; for although at other\r\nseasons they pasture together, at the period of copulation they quarrel\r\nand fight together. The male camel also is violent at this time,\r\nwhether it is a man or a camel that approaches him, and he will at all\r\ntimes fight with a horse.\r\n\r\n3. The nature of wild animals is the same. For bears, wolves, and lions\r\nare savage if they are approached at this season; but they do not\r\nquarrel much among themselves, for none of them are gregarious. The\r\nshe bears are savage in defence of their cubs, and bitches for their\r\npuppies. Elephants also become wild at this period. Wherefore they say\r\nthat in India those who have the care of them do not permit them to\r\nhave sexual intercourse with the females; for they become mad at such\r\nseason and overturn the houses, which are badly built, and do many\r\nother violent acts. They say also that abundance of food will render\r\nthem more gentle. They also bring others among them which are directed\r\nto beat them, and so they punish them and reduce them to a state of\r\ndiscipline.\r\n\r\n4. Those creatures which have frequent sexual intercourse, like\r\ndomestic animals, as the hog and dog, appear to be less influenced by\r\nthese circumstances on account of the frequency of their coition. Of\r\nall females the mare is the most violent in her sexual desires, and\r\nthen the cow. Mares are subject to the affection called hippomania, and\r\nthis name is transferred from this single animal to intemperate and\r\nlascivious persons. They are said to be affected by the wind at such\r\nseasons: wherefore in Crete they never separate the stallions from the\r\nmares. When the mares are thus affected, they separate themselves from\r\nthe other horses. In swine the same affection is called καπρίζειν, to\r\ndesire the boar. They never run to the east or the west, but either\r\nnorth or south.\r\n\r\n5. When they suffer from this affection, they will allow no one to\r\napproach them, till they either are so fatigued that they can go no\r\nfurther, or come to the sea: they then eject some substance, which\r\nhas received the name of hippomanes, like that on a new-born colt. It\r\nresembles the capria of the sow. Poisoners diligently seek for this\r\nsubstance. At the season of sexual intercourse they lean upon each\r\nother more than at other times, and move their tails, and utter a\r\ndifferent sound from that which is common to them. A fluid like semen\r\nalso flows from their genital organs, but it is much more thin than\r\nthat of the male; and some persons call this fluid hippomanes, though\r\nit is not that which is produced upon colts. It is difficult to collect\r\nthis fluid, for it does not appear in large quantities. When they\r\nare desirous of sexual intercourse, they often make water, and sport\r\ntogether: this is the nature of horses.\r\n\r\n6. Cows desire the bull. They are so taken up by their passion, that\r\nthe cowherds cannot manage them. Mares and cows shew the vehemence of\r\ntheir desire by the swelling of their genital parts. Cows also, like\r\nmares, make water very frequently. The cows also mount upon the bull,\r\nand follow, and stand beside him. The younger animals, both among\r\nhorses and oxen, are the first to desire sexual intercourse; and in\r\nfine weather, when their health is good, the vehemence of their desire\r\nis still stronger. If the manes of the mares are cut, their desires\r\nbecome weaker, and they are rendered more gentle.\r\n\r\n7. The stallions recognise the mares of their own herds by the scent;\r\nand if any strangers become mixed with them a few days before the\r\nperiod of coition, they bite them till they go away, and each stallion\r\nfeeds apart with his own mares. Thirty mares, or rather less, are given\r\nto each; and if any male approaches, he turns and goes round the mares\r\nin a circle, and then prepares to fight. If any one of the females\r\nattempts to move, he bites and prevents her.\r\n\r\n8. At the season of sexual intercourse the bull pastures with the cows,\r\nand fights with other bulls: at other times the sexes keep themselves\r\nseparate: this is called ἀτιμαγελεῖν (despising the herd); those in\r\nEpirus are often not seen for three months: and generally all, or\r\nnearly all, wild animals, do not herd with their females before the\r\nseason of sexual intercourse: but as soon as they come to puberty the\r\nmales separate themselves, and cease to feed with the females. Sows,\r\nwhen they are urged by sexual desire, or, as it is called, desire the\r\nboar (καπρᾳν), will even attack men. In bitches this affection is\r\ncalled σκυζᾳν, to desire the dog.\r\n\r\n9. When females are urged with desire, their genital organs are swollen\r\nwith heat, and a fluid secretion takes place. Mares scatter about\r\na white fluid at this season. In no creatures are the catamenia so\r\nabundant as in women. In sheep and goats at the season of coition,\r\nthere are certain signs before copulation: there are also signs after\r\ncopulation, but these again cease till the period of parturition,\r\nwhen they again occur. By this means shepherds understand that they\r\nare about to produce their young. After parturition there is a great\r\npurification, which at first is not very full of blood, but becomes so\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\n10. In the cow, the ass, and mare, this purification is abundant, on\r\naccount of their great size; but still it is small, considering how\r\nlarge they are. When the cow is urged by desire, she undergoes a brief\r\npurification, about half-a-cup full, or a little more. The time of\r\nthis purification is peculiarly the period for sexual intercourse. Of\r\nall quadrupeds the mare suffers the least, and is the most cleanly in\r\nparturition: neither is her loss of blood great considering the size\r\nof the animal. In cows and mares, the failure of the catamenia in the\r\nsecond, fourth, and sixth month is considered as a sign of pregnancy;\r\nbut it is not easy for anyone to understand this, who does not follow\r\nand accustom himself to them: and some persons are of opinion that they\r\nhave no catamenia. The female oreus has no catamenia, but her urine is\r\nthicker than that of the male.\r\n\r\n11. On the whole, the liquid excrements are thicker in other animals\r\nthan in man; and those of female sheep and goats thicker than in the\r\nmales of the same animal. That of the she ass is thinner, of the cow is\r\nharsher, than of their respective males. After parturition the urine\r\nof all creatures becomes thicker, and especially in those which have\r\nno purification. When females begin to feel sexual desires, their milk\r\nis like pus; it afterwards becomes useful after parturition. Sheep and\r\ngoats become fat when they are pregnant, and consume more food; and so\r\ndo cows, and all other quadrupeds.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n1. Generally speaking, the sexual desires of animals are more violent\r\nin spring. They do not all, however, copulate at the same seasons,\r\nbut at the time of year which will cause them to produce their young\r\nat the proper season. The period of gestation in domestic swine is\r\nfour months. They never produce more than twenty pigs; and if they\r\nhave many, they cannot bring them all up. When aged, they produce in\r\nthe same manner, but they copulate more slowly. They become pregnant\r\nwith one act of coition; but they submit themselves to the boar very\r\nfrequently, on account of their rejection of the capria after they are\r\npregnant. This takes place in all, but some will also eject the semen.\r\n\r\n2. If any of the pigs are injured or deteriorated during pregnancy, it\r\nis called metachæron. This may take place in any part of the uterus. In\r\nparturition the sow gives the first teat to the first pig. It is not\r\nnecessary that she should go to the boar as soon as the sexual appetite\r\nis felt, or before her ears begin to hang down; for otherwise she\r\ndesires to go again. If she goes to the boar when she is desirous of\r\nit, the impregnation is complete in a single act of intercourse. Barley\r\nis a proper food for the boar at the period of coition. It should be\r\ncooked for the female after parturition. Some sows produce excellent\r\npigs from the first; others do not produce good offspring and pigs till\r\nthey are grown up. Some persons say that if one of the eyes of a sow\r\nis put out, she generally speaking dies very soon. Most of them live\r\nfifteen. Some die in less than twenty years.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n1. Sheep become pregnant after three or four acts of sexual\r\nintercourse. If rain falls after the act of intercourse, it must be\r\nrepeated. The nature of goats is the same. They generally produce two,\r\nand sometimes three. Cases have occurred of their producing four. The\r\nperiod of gestation in the sheep and goat is five months; and in some\r\nplaces, where the weather is warm and fine, and food is abundant, they\r\nhave young twice a-year. The goat will live eight years. The sheep\r\nlives ten years, or generally rather less; but the leaders of the flock\r\nlive fifteen years; for in every flock they select one of the males\r\nas a leader, who, when called by the shepherd, places himself at the\r\nhead of the flock. They are accustomed to this duty even when young. In\r\nEthiopia the sheep live twelve or thirteen years, and the goats ten or\r\neleven.\r\n\r\n2. Both the sheep and goat enjoy sexual intercourse as long as they\r\nlive. Sheep and goats produce twins, if either the pasture is good, or\r\nthe ram or he-goat, or the ewe belongs to a race producing twins. They\r\nproduce females or males both from the nature of the water (for there\r\nare some waters that cause them to produce males and others females)\r\nand from their manner of sexual intercourse; and if the wind is\r\nnorthward during copulation they produce males; and if it is southward,\r\nfemales; and one which naturally produces females will change its\r\nnature and produce males; so that it is necessary to see that they\r\nstand to the north during the act of sexual intercourse. If any are\r\naccustomed to copulate early, and the ram is introduced to them late,\r\nthey will not endure it.\r\n\r\n3. The lambs are white or black according as the veins beneath the\r\ntongue of the ram are white or black; for the lambs are white if\r\nthe veins are white, and black if they are black. If they are both\r\nblack and white, the lambs also are of two colours; and if red, then\r\nthe lambs are red. They are more ready for sexual intercourse if\r\nthey drink salt water; so that they should be supplied with salted\r\nwater both before and after parturition, and again in the spring.\r\nThe herdsmen do not constitute any leader among the flocks of goats,\r\nbecause it is not their nature to be stationary, but they are active\r\nand ready to move from place to place. If the older sheep prepare for\r\nsexual intercourse at the proper time, the shepherds consider it a sign\r\nof a good year for the sheep; if the younger ones are ready first, it\r\nwill be a bad sheep year.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n1. There are many kinds of dogs. The Lacedemonian dogs, both male and\r\nfemale, begin to have sexual intercourse at eight months old. Some\r\nalso lift their leg to make water about this period. The bitch becomes\r\npregnant with a single act of coition; this is particularly evident\r\nin those which perform the act in secret, for they become pregnant\r\nwhen once united. The period of gestation in the Lacedemonian bitch is\r\nthe sixth part of a year, that is sixty days, or it may be one, two,\r\nor three days more or less. The puppies when they are born are blind\r\nfor twelve days. The bitch is ready for sexual intercourse six months\r\nafter she has produced her young, and not sooner. In some the period\r\nof gestation is the fifth part of a year, this is seventy-two days.\r\nThe puppies of such bitches are blind for fourteen days. Others are\r\npregnant the fourth part of a year, that is three whole months; their\r\npuppies are blind seventeen days. The female appears to desire the male\r\nfor the same length of time.\r\n\r\n2. The catamenia in bitches last for seven days, and at the same time\r\nthe genital organs are swollen with heat; during this period they will\r\nnot endure coition, but during the seven days which follow, for they\r\nall appear usually to desire the male for fourteen days. This affection\r\ncontinues in some for sixteen days. The purification from parturition\r\ntakes place at the birth of the young ones; it is thick and phlegmatic,\r\nand the quantity produced in parturition is small in proportion to the\r\nsize of the body.[212] Bitches generally have milk five days before\r\nparturition; in some cases it appears seven, and in others four\r\ndays beforehand; the milk is good as soon as the young are born. The\r\nLacedemonian bitch gives milk in thirty days after sexual intercourse;\r\nat first it is thick, but becomes thinner afterwards. The milk of the\r\nbitch is thicker than that of other animals, except the sow and the\r\nhare.\r\n\r\n[212] (Or perhaps) after parturition the discharge becomes thinner in\r\nconsistence.\r\n\r\n3. There is evidence of their having reached the age of puberty,\r\nfor as in the human subject the mammæ begin to enlarge and become\r\ncartilaginous; it is, however, difficult to detect this without\r\npractice, for the enlargement is not very great. This takes place in\r\nthe female, nothing of the kind occurs in the male. The males generally\r\nbegin to lift up their leg to make water when they are six months old.\r\nSome do not do so till they are eight months old, and others before\r\nthey are six months old, for, to speak plainly, they do this as soon\r\nas they reach puberty; all the females sit down to make water; some,\r\nhowever, even of these lift up their leg for this purpose. The female\r\nnever produces more than twelve puppies, generally five or six, and\r\nsometimes only one; those of Lacedæmon generally have eight; both sexes\r\ncontinue to enjoy sexual intercourse as long as they live.\r\n\r\n4. It is a peculiarity of the Lacedemonian dog, that it is more ready\r\nfor sexual intercourse after hard work than when idle; the male of\r\nthis kind lives ten years, the female for twelve, most other dogs live\r\nfourteen or fifteen years, some even twenty, for which reason some\r\npersons think that Homer is right when he makes the dog of Ulysses to\r\nhave died at the age of twenty. On account of the hard work which the\r\nLacedemonian dogs have to endure the female lives longer than the male;\r\nin other races this is not so plainly observed, but the male is usually\r\nlonger lived than the female. The dog does not shed any teeth except\r\nthose called the canine teeth, these are shed by both sexes at four\r\nmonths old. Because they shed these only, a question is raised, for\r\nsome persons altogether deny that they shed only two teeth, for it is\r\ndifficult to meet with these, and others, when they see that they shed\r\nthese, think that they must shed all their teeth. People judge of the\r\nage of a dog by its teeth, for in young dogs they are white and sharp,\r\nin old ones they are black and blunted.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n1. The cow is impregnated with a single act of coition, and the bull\r\nmounts upon her with such violence that she bends beneath his weight.\r\nIf he fails to impregnate her after twenty days, she is again admitted\r\nto the bull. Old bulls will not mount the same cow several times in the\r\nsame day unless there is some intermission, but young bulls, incited by\r\nthe strength of their desires, will force the same cow several times,\r\nand will mount upon many in succession. The bull is one of the least\r\nlascivious of animals. The conqueror copulates with the female, but if\r\nhe become impotent from frequent sexual intercourse, the inferior will\r\nattack him, and often prevail.\r\n\r\n2. Both the male and the female commence sexual intercourse, so as to\r\nproduce young, at a year old, though not generally till they are a year\r\nand eight months old, or two years old according to general agreement.\r\nThe female is pregnant nine months, and produces her young in the tenth\r\nmonth; some persons affirm that parturition takes place at ten months\r\nto a day; if any of them calve before the above mentioned time, the\r\ncalf is abortive and does not live, and even if born a little before\r\nthe proper time it cannot live, for the hoofs are imperfect. The female\r\ngenerally produces one at a time, sometimes two. She continues to bear\r\nand to have sexual intercourse as long as she lives.\r\n\r\n3. The female usually lives fifteen years, and so does the male if he\r\nis not castrated; some live for more than twenty years if they have an\r\nactive body. They usually place castrated oxen as leaders of the herd,\r\nas they do in sheep, and these live longer than the others, for they do\r\nno work, and feed in a superior pasture. They attain perfection at five\r\nyears old, wherefore some say that Homer was right when he spoke of the\r\nmale flourishing at five years old, and the cow at nine years old, for\r\nboth expressions have the same meaning.\r\n\r\n4. Oxen change their teeth at two years old, not all of them, however,\r\nbut only like the horse; they do not cast their hoofs when they are\r\nlame, but only swell very much about the feet. The milk is good\r\nimmediately after calving, but the cow has no milk beforehand. The\r\nmilk which is first formed becomes hard like a stone when it is\r\ncoagulated; this takes place if it is not mixed with water. They do not\r\nproduce young before they are a year old, except in some remarkable\r\ncases, for some have been known to copulate at four months old. Most\r\nof them desire sexual intercourse in the months of April and May.\r\nSome, however, are not impregnated before the autumn. When many become\r\npregnant and admit the male, it is a sign of cold and rainy weather.\r\nThe usual discharges occur in cows as they do in mares, but the\r\nquantity is less.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n1. Both the horse and mare begin to use sexual intercourse at two years\r\nold. Such early cases, however, are rare, and their offspring small and\r\nweak; and generally they commence at three years old, and they continue\r\nto produce better colts till they are twenty years old. The period of\r\ngestation is eleven months; parturition takes place in the twelfth. The\r\nmale does not impregnate the female in any particular number of days;\r\nbut at times in one, two, or three, sometimes in more. The ass mounts\r\nand impregnates more quickly than the horse; and the act of intercourse\r\nis not laborious in horses as it is in oxen. Next to the human subject,\r\nthe horse in both sexes is the most lascivious of all animals. The\r\nsexual intercourse of the younger horses takes place before the usual\r\nage according to the goodness and abundance of their food. The horse\r\ngenerally produces but one colt, or sometimes two at the outside. The\r\nhemionus has also been known to produce two, but this is considered\r\nextraordinary. The horse begins sexual intercourse at thirty months\r\nold, so that it can produce proper colts when it has done changing\r\nits teeth. Some have been known, they say, to impregnate mares while\r\nchanging their teeth, unless they were naturally barren.\r\n\r\n2. The horse has forty teeth. It sheds its four first teeth at thirty\r\nmonths old, two above and two below. A year afterwards, it sheds four\r\nmore in the same manner, two above and two below. And again, at the\r\nend of the next year, it sheds four more in the same manner. When it\r\nis four years and a half old, it sheds no more; and individuals have\r\nbeen known to shed them all at first, and others that have shed them\r\nall in the last year. These circumstances are rare, so that it usually\r\nhappens that the horse is most fit for sexual intercourse at four years\r\nand a half old. The older horses are more full of semen, both the males\r\nand the females, than younger ones. Horses will copulate both with\r\ntheir dams and with their offspring; and it is thought to be a sign\r\nthat the herd is complete, when they copulate with their offspring. The\r\nScythians ride upon their pregnant mares when the embryo begins to turn\r\nin the uterus, and say that it renders parturition more easy. All other\r\nquadrupeds lie down in the act of parturition; wherefore their young\r\nare always produced lying on their side; but when the mare feels that\r\nthe time for parturition is approaching, she stands upright to part\r\nwith her colt.\r\n\r\n3. Horses generally live eighteen or twenty years; some live\r\ntwenty-five or thirty years; but if they are carefully treated, their\r\nlife may be extended to fifty years. Thirty years, however, is a very\r\nlong life for the male, and twenty-five for the female. Some have been\r\nknown to live forty years. Males live a shorter time than females, on\r\naccount of the act of sexual intercourse; and those that are brought up\r\nseparately longer than those which live in herds. Females attain their\r\nproper length and height in five years; the males in six. In six more\r\nyears the fulness of body is acquired, which continues till they are\r\ntwenty years old. The females attain perfection more rapidly than the\r\nmales; but in the uterus the males are the more rapidly developed. This\r\nis also the case in the human subject. This also takes place in those\r\nanimals which produce several at a birth.\r\n\r\n4. They say that the mule sucks for six months, but the mare will not\r\npermit it to come afterwards, because it drags and hurts her. The horse\r\nsucks for a longer time. The horse and the mule attain perfection after\r\ncasting their teeth; and when they have cast them all, it is not easy\r\nto know their age. Wherefore they say that, before casting its teeth,\r\nthe horse has its mark, which it has not afterwards. After the teeth\r\nhave been changed, the age is usually ascertained by the canine tooth;\r\nfor that in riding horses is generally worn down, for the bridle rubs\r\nagainst it. In horses which have not been ridden, it is large and not\r\nworn. In young horses it is small and sharp.\r\n\r\n5. The male copulates at all seasons, and as long as he lives; the\r\nfemale also as long as she lives; and at all seasons, unless they\r\nhave on a fastening or some other hindrance, no peculiar time is\r\nappropriated for copulation in either sex, for there is no period of\r\ncoition when they cannot also bring up their young. In Opus there was\r\na horse in a herd which engendered when he was forty years old; but it\r\nwas necessary to lift up his fore legs for him. Mares begin to desire\r\nsexual intercourse in the spring; and when the mare has foaled, she\r\ndoes not become pregnant again immediately, but waits for a time, and\r\nproduces better foals at the end of four or five years. It is quite\r\nnecessary that she should wait one year, and should pass through a\r\nfallow, as it were.\r\n\r\n6. The horse, then, bears young at intervals, as I have observed; but\r\nthe ass is not subject to intervals. Some mares are quite barren, and\r\nothers, though they conceive, yet do not produce their young; and they\r\ngive as a reason for this, that upon dissection the fœtus was found to\r\ncontain other reniform bodies round the kidneys, so that it appeared\r\nto have four kidneys. As soon as the mare has foaled, she eats the\r\nchorion, and bites from the head of her foal the substance called\r\nhippomanes. In size this substance is somewhat less than a dry fig.\r\nIts form is flat and round, and its colour black. If any person is at\r\nhand to take it before the mare, and she smells it, the scent renders\r\nher wild and mad. For this reason it is sought after and collected by\r\npoisoners. If an ass copulates with a pregnant mare, the pre-existing\r\nfœtus is destroyed. Those who keep herds of horses do not place a\r\nleader over them, as they do over oxen, for they are not naturally\r\nstationary, but active and wandering.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n1. The male and female ass begin to copulate at thirty months old, and\r\nshed their first teeth at the same period. They lose their second pair\r\nof teeth six months afterwards, and their third and fourth in the same\r\nway. These fourth teeth are called the marking teeth. Sometimes the\r\nass has become pregnant and brought up its young at a year old. The\r\nshe ass parts with the semen after coition, if she is not prevented;\r\nand therefore, immediately after coition, they beat her and drive her\r\nabout. She foals in the twelfth month, and generally produces one foal,\r\nfor this is their nature, though cases of twin births have occurred. If\r\nan ass mounts upon a mare, he destroys her fœtus, as I observed before.\r\nBut the horse does not destroy the fœtus of the ass, if the mare has\r\nbeen impregnated by a he ass.\r\n\r\n2. The pregnant female has milk at the end of ten months. After\r\nparturition, she will admit the male on the seventh day, and is very\r\neasily impregnated at that period. She will also receive it afterwards.\r\nIf she does not produce young before losing her marking teeth, she can\r\nnever be impregnated all the rest of her life. She does not like men\r\nto be witnesses of her parturition, nor will she produce her young in\r\nthe day time; but when it is dark she retires, and so produces her\r\nyoung. She continues to procreate during her whole life, if she has\r\nbegun before losing her marking teeth. The ass lives more than thirty\r\nyears, and the female longer than the male. When a horse copulates\r\nwith an ass, or a he ass with a mare, abortion is more frequent than\r\nbetween congeners, a horse with a mare, or two asses together. When the\r\nhorse and ass are mixed together, the period of gestation follows from\r\nthe male parent. I mean to say that it takes the same time as if the\r\nparents had been congeners; but in size, form, and strength the produce\r\nof their union generally resembles the female parent.\r\n\r\n3. If the union takes place frequently, and sufficient time is not\r\nallowed to intervene, the female soon becomes barren. For which reason\r\nthose who attend to this business do not permit them to have continual\r\nintercourse, but interpose a proper interval. The mare will not admit\r\nthe he ass, nor the she ass the horse, unless the he ass has been\r\nsuckled by a mare. They are careful, therefore, to admit only those\r\nasses which they call hippothelæ, _i.e._ asses which have been suckled\r\nby a mare. These copulate by force in the pastures, like horses.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\n1. The oreus (mule) mounts and copulates after shedding the first\r\nteeth, and when seven years old is able to engender; and the ginnus is\r\nproduced when he mounts upon a mare. After this he no longer continues\r\nto copulate. The female oreus also has been impregnated, but the\r\nfœtus has never been known to come to maturity. The hemioni (female\r\nmules) of Syria, near Phœnicia, admit the male and procreate. The kind,\r\nhowever, though similar, is not the same. Those which are called ginni\r\nare produced from a mare, when the fœtus has received some injury in\r\nthe uterus, like dwarfs among men and metachœra among swine; and the\r\nginnus, like the dwarf, has a large genital organ.\r\n\r\n2. The hemionus has a long life; for they have been known to live\r\nfor eighty years, as in Athens, when they built the temple, this\r\nindividual, though failing with age, helped in drawing, and went beside\r\nthem, and encouraged the yoke mules to their work, so that an edict was\r\nmade, commanding the corn-dealers not to drive it away from the vessels\r\nfilled with corn. The female mule (oreus) grows old sooner than the\r\nmale. Some persons say that she is purified when making water, but the\r\nmale ages more rapidly from smelling the urine.\r\n\r\n3. This is the manner of the reproduction of these animals. Those who\r\nare employed in bringing up these animals recognize the young from the\r\nold in this way. If the skin, when drawn back from the cheek, soon\r\nrecovers its shape, the animal is young; if the skin continues wrinkled\r\nfor a long while, the creature is aged.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\n1. The camel is pregnant ten months, and always produces a single\r\nyoung one, for this is its nature. They separate the young camel from\r\nthe herd at a year old. The camel will live more than fifty years.\r\nThe season of parturition is in the spring, and the female continues\r\nto give milk until she conceives again. Their flesh and milk are\r\nexceedingly sweet. The milk is drunk mixed with two or three times its\r\nquantity of water.\r\n\r\n2. Elephants begin to copulate at twenty years old. When the female is\r\nimpregnated, her period of gestation, some persons say, is a year and a\r\nhalf; other people make it three years. The difficulty of seeing their\r\ncopulation causes this difference of opinion respecting the period of\r\ngestation. The female produces her young bending upon her haunches. Her\r\npain is evident. The calf, when it is born, sucks with its mouth, and\r\nnot with its proboscis. It can walk and see as soon as it is born.\r\n\r\n3. Wild swine copulate at the beginning of winter. They produce their\r\nyoung in the spring. For this purpose the female gets away into\r\ninaccessible and precipitous places, where there are caves and plenty\r\nof shade. The males remain with the females for thirty days. The number\r\nof pigs and the period of gestation are the same as in the domesticated\r\nherd, and their voices are much alike: the female, however, grunts\r\nmore and the male less. The castration of the male makes them larger\r\nand more fierce, as Homer writes. \"He brought up a castrated wild\r\nboar, which was not like a beast fed upon food, but resembled a woody\r\nmountain peak.\" Castration takes place from a disease like a swelling\r\nin the testicles, which they rub against the trees and so destroy them.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\n1. The female deer usually copulates, as I observed before, from\r\nallurement; for she cannot endure the male on account of the hardness\r\nof the penis. Some, however, endure copulation as sheep do. When sexual\r\ndesire is felt, they lie down beside each other. The male is changeable\r\nin his disposition, and does not unite himself to a single female,\r\nbut in a short time leaves one for another. The season for sexual\r\nintercourse is in August and September, after Arcturus. The period of\r\ngestation is eight months. The female becomes pregnant in a few days,\r\nand frequently in one day.\r\n\r\n2. She generally produces one fawn, though some have been known to\r\nbear twins. She produces her young by the road side, for fear of\r\nwild beasts. The growth of the fawns is rapid. The female has no\r\npurification at other times, but after parturition her cleansing is\r\nsanguineous. The female usually conducts her fawn to some accustomed\r\nplace, which serves them for a refuge. It is usually an opening in a\r\nrock, with but one entrance, where they can defend themselves against\r\nthose who would attack them.\r\n\r\n3. There are fables about their long life. They do not, however,\r\nappear to be worthy of credit; and the period of gestation and growth\r\nof the young does not agree with the habits of long-lived animals. In\r\nthe mountain called Elaphoïs, in Arginusa, in Asia, where Alcibiades\r\ndied, all the deer have their ears divided, so that they can be known\r\nif they migrate to another place, and even the fœtus in utero has this\r\ndistinction. The females have four nipples, like cows.\r\n\r\n4. As soon as the females are impregnated, the males go and live apart\r\nfrom them, and, urged by their sexual desires, they each go apart and\r\nmake a hole, in which they emit a strong smell like he goats, and\r\ntheir faces become black, by being sprinkled like those of goats. This\r\ncontinues till after rain, when they turn again to their pasture. The\r\nanimal acts in this way on account of its violent sexual desires and\r\nits fatness. In summer time this is so great that they cannot run, but\r\nare taken by those who pursue them, even on foot, in the second or\r\nthird race.\r\n\r\n5. They frequent the water both on account of the heat and the\r\ndifficulty of breathing. At the period of sexual intercourse, their\r\nflesh is inferior both in taste and smell, like that of he-goats. In\r\nwinter they are thin and weak, and in the spring are most active for\r\nthe chase. When chased, they sometimes rest awhile, and remain standing\r\ntill their pursuers come up with them, when they start afresh. They\r\nseem to do this from a pain in their intestines; for their viscera are\r\nso thin and weak that if they are only struck gently they are ruptured,\r\nthough the hide remains sound.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\n1. Bears perform the act of sexual intercourse in the manner already\r\ndescribed, not mounting upon each other, but lying down upon the\r\nground. The female is pregnant thirty days, when she produces one or\r\ntwo, or at the outside five cubs. The fœtus is smaller, in proportion\r\nto the size of the parent, than that of any other animal; for it is\r\nless than a weasel, and greater than a mouse. It is without hair and\r\nblind, and its legs and almost all its parts are without joints. Its\r\nseason of sexual intercourse is in March. The cubs are born at the time\r\nof concealment. At this season both the female and the male are very\r\nfat. When they have brought up their young, they show themselves in the\r\nthird month of the spring. The porcupine also conceals itself, and is\r\npregnant for the same number of days, and in other respects resembles\r\nthe bear. It is very difficult to capture the she bear when pregnant.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\n1. It has already been observed that the lion both copulates and makes\r\nwater backwards. They do not copulate and produce their young at all\r\nseasons of the year, though they produce annually. The young are\r\nproduced in the spring. The female generally produces two, never more\r\nthan six, and sometimes only one. The fable which says that the uterus\r\nis ejected in parturition is a mistake. It has arisen from the rarity\r\nof the animal, those who invented the fable being ignorant of the true\r\nstate of the case. The race of lions is rare, and not to be found in\r\nevery place, but only in the country between the Achelous and the\r\nNessus in the whole of Europe. The young of the lion are very small at\r\ntheir birth, so that they can hardly walk at two months old. The Syrian\r\nlions produce five times; at first five cubs, and then one less every\r\ntime. After this they produce no more, but continue barren. The lioness\r\nhas no mane, though the lion has. The lion only sheds its four canine\r\nteeth, two above and two below. They are shed when the animal is six\r\nmonths old.\r\n\r\n2. The hyæna is of the colour of the wolf, but it is more hairy, and\r\nhas a mane along the ridge of its back. It is a mistake to say that\r\neach individual has the sexual organs of both sexes. That of the male\r\nresembles the same organ in the wolf and the dog. That which has\r\nbeen imagined to be the female organ is placed beneath the tail, and\r\nit resembles that of the female, but is imperforate, and the anus\r\nis beneath it. The female hyena has an organ similar to that which\r\nbears its name in the male. It is placed beneath the tail, and is\r\nimperforate. Beneath this is the anus, and below this again the true\r\ngenital organ. The female hyena has an uterus like that of other\r\nanimals of the class, but the female is rarely captured. A certain\r\nhunter said that he caught eleven hyænas of which only one was a female.\r\n\r\n3. Hares copulate backwards, as I formerly observed, for it is a\r\nretromingent animal. They copulate and produce their young at all\r\nseasons. They become pregnant a second time while they are pregnant,\r\nand produce their young every month. They do not produce their young\r\ncontinually, but as many days as may be intervene. The female has\r\nmilk before the young are produced. As soon as her young are born,\r\nshe copulates again and conceives while giving milk. The milk is as\r\nthick as that of the sow. The young are born blind, like those of many\r\nanimals with divided feet.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\n1. The fox copulates, mounting on the back of the female. The young are\r\nborn blind, like those of the bear, and are even more inarticulate.\r\nWhen the season of parturition approaches, the female goes apart, so\r\nthat it is rare to take a pregnant fox. When the young are born, the\r\ndam licks them, in order to warm and mature them. She never produces\r\nmore than four.\r\n\r\n2. The periods of gestation and parturition, both in point of time and\r\nthe number of the young, are the same in the wolf as in the dog, and\r\nthe young are blind, like those of the dog. They copulate at one season\r\nof the year, and the young are produced in the beginning of summer.\r\nA fabulous story is told of their parturition; for they say that all\r\nthe she wolves produce their young in twelve days in the year; and the\r\nreason which is given for this fable is this, that during this number\r\nof days Latona was brought from the Hyperborean regions to Delos, in\r\nthe form of a wolf, for fear of Juno. Whether this is or is not the\r\nperiod of parturition has never yet been ascertained. At present it\r\nonly rests upon tradition. It does not appear to be true, nor that\r\nother tale which says that wolves only produce once in their life.\r\n\r\n3. Cats and ichneumons produce their young in the same manner as dogs,\r\nand live upon the same things. They live about six years. The young of\r\nthe panther are born blind. They are never more than four in number.\r\nThe jackal is impregnated like a bitch, and the young are born blind.\r\nThey produce two, or three, or four. Its length towards the tail is\r\ngreat. Its height is small. It runs very swiftly, although its legs\r\nare short; but on account of the softness of its tissues it can leap a\r\ngreat distance.\r\n\r\n4. In Syria there are animals called hemioni which are different from\r\nthose derived from a mixture of the horse and ass, though they resemble\r\nthem in appearance. As the wild ass is named from its resemblance to\r\nthe domestic kind, the wild asses and the hemioni differ from the\r\ndomestic race in speed. These hemioni are derived from their own\r\ncongeners, of which this is a proof. For some came to Phrygia in the\r\ntime of Pharnaces, the father of Pharnabazus, and remain there still.\r\nThere are now only three, though they say that at first there were nine.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\n1. The reproduction of mice is more wonderful than that of any other\r\nanimal, both in number and rapidity. For a pregnant female was left in\r\na vessel of corn; and after a short time the vessel was opened, and a\r\nhundred and twenty mice were counted. There is a doubt respecting the\r\nreproduction and destruction of the mice which live on the ground; for\r\nsuch an inexpressible number of field mice have sometimes made their\r\nappearance that very little food remained. Their power of destruction\r\nalso is so great that some small farmers, having on one day observed\r\nthat their corn was ready for harvest, when they went the following day\r\nto cut their corn, found it all eaten.\r\n\r\n2. The manner of their disappearance also is unaccountable; for in\r\na few days they all vanish, although beforehand they could not be\r\nexterminated by smoking and digging them out, nor by hunting them and\r\nturning swine among them to root up their runs. Foxes also hunt them\r\nout, and wild weasels[213] are very ready to destroy them; but they\r\ncannot prevail over their numbers and the rapidity of their increase,\r\nnor indeed can anything prevail over them but rain, and when this comes\r\nthey disappear very soon.\r\n\r\n[213] Perhaps ferret, Mustela varo, or weasel.\r\n\r\n3. In a certain part of Persia the female fœtus of the mice are found\r\nto be pregnant in the uterus of their parent. Some people say and\r\naffirm that if they lick salt they become pregnant without copulation.\r\nThe Egyptian mice have hair nearly resembling that of the hedgehog.\r\nThere are other kinds which go upon two feet, for their fore feet are\r\nsmall and their hind feet large.[214] They are very numerous. There are\r\nalso many other kinds of mice.\r\n\r\n[214] Serboa, Dipus gerbillus, or D. jaculus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THE SEVENTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n1. The circumstances attending on the growth of man, from his\r\nconception in the womb even to old age, derived from his peculiar\r\nnature, are after this manner. We have already treated of the\r\ndistinctions of the male and female and their parts. The male begins\r\nto have semen at about the age of fourteen complete. At the same time\r\nhair begins to appear on the pubes. As Alcmæon of Crotona says that\r\nflowers blossom before they bear seed, about the same period the voice\r\nbegins to become more harsh and irregular. It is neither quite harsh,\r\nnor deep, nor all alike, but it resembles a discordant and harsh\r\ninstrument. This is called τραγίζειν, to have a voice like a goat.\r\n\r\n2. This is more conspicuous in those who attempt the gratification of\r\nsexual desires; for those who are vehement in these desires rapidly\r\npass into a man's voice. In those that refrain themselves the contrary\r\noccurs. In those who, like some singers, endeavour to avoid this\r\nchange, the voice will continue for a long while, and never undergo any\r\ngreat change. The breasts also and pudendum not only increase in size,\r\nbut their general appearance is changed. At this period of life, if a\r\nperson is urged to the emission of semen, the discharge is accompanied\r\nwith pain as well as pleasure.\r\n\r\n3. About the same period also the breasts of females enlarge, and the\r\ncatamenia make their appearance. They resemble the blood of a newly\r\nkilled animal. In young girls only do they appear white, especially\r\nif they make use of fluid food. This complaint stops the growth and\r\nweakens the body of girls. The catamenia usually appear when the mammæ\r\nare about two fingers high. The voice of girls also becomes deeper at\r\nthis period, for on the whole the voice of women is more acute than\r\nthat of men, and the voice of girls than that of old women, as the\r\nvoice of boys is more acute than the voice of men. The voice of female\r\nchildren also is more acute than that of males, and the windpipe is\r\nmore acute in girls than boys.\r\n\r\n4. They also want especial care at this period, for their sexual\r\ndesires are very strong at the commencement, so that if they now take\r\ncare to avoid every excitement, except such as the change of their body\r\nrequires, without using venery, they generally remain temperate in\r\nafter-years. For girls who indulge in venery when young, generally grow\r\nup intemperate; and so do males if they are unguarded either one way or\r\nboth ways; for at this age the ducts open and afford an easy passage\r\nfor the fluid through the body, and at the same time the memory of past\r\npleasures causes a desire for present gratification.\r\n\r\n5. Some men never have hair on the pubes from their birth, nor seed,\r\non account of the destruction of the parts appropriated to the semen.\r\nThere are some women also who never have hair on the pubes. The male\r\nand female also change their habits of sickness and of health, and the\r\nproportions of their body, whether slight or stout, or of a good habit.\r\nSome thin boys after they attain puberty become stout and healthy, in\r\nothers the contrary takes place. This is the case also with females;\r\nfor whether boys or girls have their bodies loaded with excrementitious\r\nmatter, this is separated in the one by puberty, in the other by the\r\ncatamenia. They become more healthy and thriving when that which had\r\nprevented health and growth is removed.\r\n\r\n6. Those which are of the contrary habit of body become more thin and\r\ndelicate; for their naturally healthy condition is separated in the\r\npuberty of one sex, and the catamenia of the other. There is also\r\nconsiderable variety in the bosoms of young girls, for in some they are\r\nvery large, in others small. This generally takes place in those girls\r\nwhich have much superfluous humour, for when the catamenia are about to\r\nappear, but before they arrive, the more fluid the patient is, the more\r\nnecessary it is that the breasts should increase until the catamenia\r\nmake their appearance, and the breasts, which then begin to increase,\r\nremain so afterwards. In youths and aged men the breasts are more\r\nconspicuous, and more like those of females; and in those who are of a\r\nsoft habit of body, and are smooth and not full of veins, and in dark\r\npersons also more than fair ones.\r\n\r\n7. Until twenty-one years of age the semen is unproductive, afterwards\r\nit becomes fertile, though boys and girls produce small and imperfect\r\nchildren: this is also the case with other animals. Young girls\r\nconceive more readily, but after conception suffer more in parturition,\r\nand their bodies frequently become imperfect. Men of violent passions,\r\nand women that have borne many children, grow old more rapidly than\r\nothers; nor does there appear to be any increase after they have borne\r\nthree children. Women of violent sexual desires become more temperate\r\nafter they have borne several children.\r\n\r\n8. Women who have attained thrice seven years are well adapted for\r\nchild-bearing, and men also are capable of becoming parents. Thin\r\nseminal fluid is barren. That which is lumpy begets males; what is thin\r\nand not clotted, females. The beard also appears on the chin of men at\r\nthe same period.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n1. The catamenia appear when the moon is on the wane, from which some\r\npersons would argue that the moon is a female, for the purification of\r\nwomen and the waning of the moon occur together, and repletion occurs\r\nagain in both after the purification and waning. In few women the\r\ncatamenia occur every month, but in most at every third month. Those in\r\nwhom they continue for only two or three days escape with ease: it is\r\nmore difficult for those in whom it continues for a longer time, for\r\nthey suffer during the whole period. In some the purification takes\r\nplace all at once, in others by degrees; in all, however, the pain\r\nis considerable as long as they are present. In many women, when the\r\ncatamenia are nearly ready to appear, the womb suffers so much from\r\nstrangulation and disturbance, until they are discharged.\r\n\r\n2. Conception naturally takes place immediately after this discharge\r\nin women, and those who do not then conceive, are usually barren. Some\r\nwomen, however, who have never menstruated, conceive. Such persons\r\ncontain in themselves as much of the fluid as is usually left behind\r\nafter the purification, but not so much as to make its appearance\r\nexternally. Some women in whom the uterus has closed immediately after\r\nthe purification, conceive even while menstruating, but do not conceive\r\nafterwards. The catamenia sometimes occur even in pregnant women. Such\r\nwomen usually bear imperfect children, and their offspring either do\r\nnot grow up, or are weakly.\r\n\r\n3. It frequently happens that from the want of sexual intercourse, or\r\nfrom youth and the period of life, or from long abstinence, the uterus\r\ndescends, and the catamenia occur several times in the month, until\r\nthey conceive; after which the parts return to their proper place: and\r\nsometimes even in women with a good habit of body, if the humours are\r\nabundant, an effusion of the semen takes place if it is too moist.\r\n\r\n4. It has already been observed that this purification is more abundant\r\nin women than in any other creature. In animals that are not viviparous\r\nno symptoms of anything of the kind occur, for this superfluous matter\r\nis returned into their own body, for in many the females are superior\r\nto the males in size, and in many it is turned to the formation of\r\nplates, or scales, or abundance of feathers. In viviparous animals\r\nwith feet, it is turned to the formation of hair and bulk of body (for\r\nman is the only animal that is smooth), or of urine; for in almost\r\nall animals this secretion is thick and abundant. In women, on the\r\ncontrary, all the superfluous matter of the body is directed to this\r\npurification.\r\n\r\n5. The case of the male is the same, for in proportion to his size,\r\nman emits more semen than other animals; (wherefore, also, man is the\r\nsmoothest of all animals,) and among men those which abound in humours,\r\nand are not very full fleshed, and fair men more than dark ones. So\r\nalso among women. For in those that are full fleshed, the greater part\r\nof the secretion goes to the supply of the body, and in the act of\r\nsexual intercourse, fair women have naturally more seminal fluid than\r\ndark ones. Liquid and acid foods also increase this kind of intercourse.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n1. It is a sign that women have conceived when the pudendum remains dry\r\nafter coition. If the labia are smooth they will not conceive, for\r\nit slips out; nor will they if the labia are thick: but if there is a\r\nsensation of roughness and resistance when touched with the finger, and\r\nthe labia are thin, they are then adapted for conception. In order that\r\nthey may be able to conceive, such women must prepare the uterus, and\r\nthe contrary that they may not conceive; for if the labia are smooth\r\nthey do not conceive: so that some women, in order that the semen may\r\nfall outside the uterus, anoint themselves with oil of cedar, or with\r\nceruse, or oil mixed with frankincense.\r\n\r\n2. If it remain seven days, it is evident that conception has taken\r\nplace, for in this period what are called the outpourings take place.\r\nThe purification takes place in many women after conception. Thirty\r\ndays afterwards in the case of conceiving a female child, and forty in\r\nthe case of a male. After parturition, also, the purification lasts a\r\nsimilar number of days, though it is not exactly the same in all.\r\n\r\n3. In the same number of days after conception the discharge no longer\r\ntakes its usual course, but is turned towards the mammæ, in which\r\nthe milk begins to make its appearance. At first the milk appears\r\nvery small, and like a web in the mammæ. After conception, the first\r\nsensation generally takes place in the iliac region, which immediately\r\nappears more full in some persons. This is more conspicuous in slight\r\npersons. If the child is a male, a movement is usually felt on the\r\nright side of the groin, in about forty days; if a female, the movement\r\noccurs on the left side, in about ninety days. We must not suppose,\r\nhowever, that an accurate judgment can be formed in this way, for it\r\noften happens that the movement is felt on the right side when a female\r\nchild, and on the left when a male child is conceived. All these, and\r\nsuch like things, vary in a greater or less degree.\r\n\r\n4. About this period, also, the fœtus becomes divided; it previously\r\nexisted as an undivided mass of flesh. If it perishes within seven\r\ndays, it is called an effluxion; if in forty days, an abortion. The\r\nfœtus often perishes within this period. If the male fœtus is excluded\r\nwithin forty days, and is put out into any other fluid, it becomes\r\ndissolved, and disappears. If placed in cold water, it becomes, as it\r\nwere, surrounded with a membrane. When this is taken off, the fœtus\r\nappears about as large as a large ant. Its parts are visible, both\r\nthose of generation, and all the rest; and the eyes are very large, as\r\nin other animals. If the female fœtus perishes within the three months,\r\nit generally appears without divisions. If it survives to the fourth\r\nmonth, the parts appear formed.\r\n\r\n5. The whole completion of the parts is more slow in the female than\r\nin the male, and parturition is more frequently delayed to the tenth\r\nmonth. After birth, females attain to youth, and puberty, and old age,\r\nmore rapidly than males, and those that have borne many children more\r\nrapidly than others, as it was observed before.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n1. When conception has taken place, the uterus usually closes\r\nimmediately for seven months. In the eighth month it opens, and the\r\nfœtus, if properly developed, begins to descend in the eighth month. If\r\nthe fœtus is not properly developed, but checked in the eighth month in\r\nparturition, women who bear in the eighth month do not exclude it, nor\r\ndoes the fœtus advance downwards in the eighth month, and the uterus\r\ndoes not open itself. It is a sign that it is not properly developed,\r\nwhen it is born before the circumstances I have described take place.\r\n\r\n2. After conception, women suffer throughout their whole body, and\r\ntheir sight becomes dim, and they are afflicted with headache. In some,\r\nthese symptoms occur very soon, as early as the tenth day; in others\r\nthey are delayed, in proportion as they have an abundance or deficiency\r\nof superfluous matter in their bodies. Nausea and vomiting often seize\r\nupon them, and on those especially in whom the purifications become\r\nstagnant, and do not yet fly to the mammæ. Some women suffer at the\r\ncommencement of pregnancy, and others in the more advanced stages, when\r\nthe fœtus begins to grow. Retention of urine also frequently attacks\r\nthem at last.\r\n\r\n3. Those that are pregnant with a male fœtus, usually pass through\r\nthe time more easily, and retain a better colour throughout. If a\r\nfemale is conceived, the contrary is the case; for they are generally\r\nmore discoloured, and suffer more during the period of gestation.\r\nIn many cases the legs swell, and a swollen condition of the flesh\r\nis also common. In some women, however, the condition is contrary.\r\nPregnant women are apt to have all sorts of fancies, which change very\r\nrapidly. Some persons call this longing. These fancies are strongest\r\nwhen a female is conceived, and there is but little pleasure in their\r\ngratification. In a few women the condition of the body is better\r\nduring pregnancy; they suffer most when the hair of the fœtus begins to\r\ngrow. Pregnant women lose the hair which grows on the parts that are\r\nhairy at birth, while it becomes more thick upon the parts on which it\r\nappears subsequent to birth.\r\n\r\n4. A male fœtus usually moves more freely in the womb than a female,\r\nand the parturition is not so long. If a female, the parturition is\r\nslower. The pain in the birth of female children is continuous, and\r\ndull; in the birth of males it is sharp, and far more severe. Those\r\nwho, before parturition, have sexual intercourse, suffer less in the\r\nprocess. Sometimes women seem to suffer, not from any pain of their\r\nown, but from the turning of the head of the child; and this appears\r\nto be the commencement of the pain. Other animals have a single exact\r\nperiod for parturition, for one time is appointed for them all. The\r\nhuman subject alone varies in this particular, for the period of\r\ngestation is seven, eight, or nine months, or ten at the outside,\r\nthough some have even advanced as far as the eleventh month.\r\n\r\n5. If any are born before the seventh month, they never live. Those of\r\nseven months are the first that are developed, but these are usually\r\nweakly, wherefore, also, they wrap them in wool. Many of these infants\r\nhave the passages, as the ears and nostrils, imperforate. As they\r\ngrow, however, they assume a proper form, and many of them survive. In\r\nEgypt, and some other places, where the women suffer little pain in\r\nparturition, and where they bear many children with ease, those even\r\nat the end of eight months are capable of living, even although they\r\nshould be monstrous; but in such places children born in the eighth\r\nmonth may survive and be brought up. In Greece, however, few of them\r\nsurvive, and most of them perish; and people suspect that if any of\r\nthem survive, the exact period of conception must have been mistaken by\r\nthe mother.\r\n\r\n6. Women suffer most in the fourth and eighth month, and if the fœtus\r\ndies in the fourth or eighth month, they usually die also; so that not\r\nonly children born in the eighth month often perish, but their mothers\r\nalso perish with them. In the same way, the period of conception\r\nprobably is mistaken by those who have been pregnant more than eleven\r\nmonths; for in these cases the beginning of the conception escapes the\r\nnotice of females, for frequently after the uterus has been distended\r\nwith flatulence, women have copulated and conceived, and supposed that\r\nthe former condition in which they observed the usual symptoms, was the\r\ncommencement of gestation.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n1. The human subject also differs from other animals, as to the number\r\nof the perfect offspring produced at a birth. For the human subject\r\ndiffers both from animals which produce but one, and those which\r\nproduce many; for, generally speaking, and, in most cases, women have\r\nbut one child at a time, though cases of twins occur frequently, and\r\nin many places, as in Egypt, three or four at a birth have been known\r\nin some particular places, as I have observed before. Five at a birth\r\nare the most that have been produced. This has been observed to take\r\nplace in many cases, but in one case only have twenty been produced\r\nat four births, for five were born each time, and many of them were\r\nreared. In other animals, if the twins are male and female, there is\r\nno more difficulty in rearing and preserving them, than if they were\r\nboth of the same sex. In the human subject there are few cases of twins\r\nsurviving, when one was male and the other female.\r\n\r\n2. The human female and the mare copulate after conception more than\r\nany other creatures, for all other females, when they have conceived,\r\nfly from the males, except those which, like the hare, become pregnant\r\na second time during gestation. But the mare, having once conceived,\r\ndoes not form a second fœtus, but generally produces a single foal. In\r\nthe human subject it happens sometimes, though rarely. Those which are\r\nconceived a long while afterwards never come to perfection, but, from\r\nthe pain which they cause, destroy the original fœtus; and a case has\r\noccurred in which twelve imperfect embryos have been produced at one\r\ntime. If the second conception take place soon after the first, they\r\nbear and produce the fœtus, as if it were a twin. This, they say, was\r\nthe case with Iphicles and Hercules.\r\n\r\n3. The possibility of the case is manifest, for an adulteress has\r\nbeen known to produce one child like her husband, and another like\r\nher paramour; and a case has occurred of a woman having conceived\r\ntwins, and then conceived a third child upon them; and when the proper\r\ntime came, the twins were born perfect, the other was only a fœtus of\r\nfive months old, which died immediately: and in another case, a woman\r\nproduced, first of all, a fœtus of seven months old, and then twins,\r\nperfectly developed; the former perished, but the latter survived. And\r\nsome women have conceived at the same time as they miscarried, and\r\nhave ejected one fœtus while they bore the other. In most females, who\r\nhave cohabited after the eighth month after conception, the child has\r\nbeen born filled with a shining mucous-like substance, and has often\r\nappeared full of the food which has been eaten by the mother; and if\r\nshe has fed upon food more than usually salt, the child has been born\r\nwithout nails.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n1. The milk that is produced before the seventh month is useless; but\r\nas soon as the child is alive the milk becomes good. At first it is\r\nsalt, like that of sheep. Most women during pregnancy are affected by\r\nwine, and if they drink it they become faint and feeble. The beginning\r\nand the ending of the reproductive power in both sexes is marked in\r\nthe male by the emission of the semen, in the female by the catamenia.\r\nThey are not, however, fertile when these first occur, nor while they\r\nare still small and weak. The period of the commencement of these signs\r\nhas been mentioned. In women the catamenia usually cease at forty; but\r\nif they pass over this age, they go on to fifty; and some have even\r\nproduced children at that period, but none later than this period.\r\n\r\n2. The reproductive function in men usually continues active till\r\nthey are sixty years old; if they pass beyond this period, till they\r\nare seventy; and some men have had children at seventy years old. It\r\nfrequently happens that, when marriages are unfruitful, both men and\r\nwomen become pregnant, if the marriage is dissolved and they marry\r\nagain. The same thing takes place respecting the birth of male and\r\nfemale children. For sometimes only children of one sex are produced\r\nby a marriage; and if this is dissolved, and the parents marry again,\r\nchildren of the other sex are produced. These things also vary with the\r\nage of the parents; for some when young have female children, and when\r\nolder males, though the contrary sometimes takes place.\r\n\r\n3. The same is the case with the whole of the reproductive function.\r\nFor some persons have no children when they are young, but have them\r\nafterwards; others have children at first, but none afterwards; and\r\nthere are some women who conceive with difficulty, but when they have\r\nconceived bear children; others conceive easily, but the fœtus never\r\ncomes to maturity. There are also both men and women who only produce\r\nchildren of one sex, as the story goes of Hercules, who had but one\r\ndaughter in seventy-two children. Those who have been barren, and\r\neither after great care, or from any other cause, at last conceive,\r\nmore frequently bear a daughter than a son. It often happens also that\r\nmen who have engendered become impotent, and subsequently return to\r\ntheir former condition.\r\n\r\n4. Maimed parents produce maimed children; and so also lame and blind\r\nparents produce lame and blind children; and, on the whole, children\r\nare often born with anything contrary to nature, or any mark which\r\ntheir parents may have, such as tumours and wounds. Such marks have\r\noften been handed down for three generations; as if a person had a mark\r\non their arm which was not seen in the son, but the grandson exhibited\r\na dark confused spot on the same place. The circumstances, however, are\r\nrare; and sound children are generally produced from lame parents; nor\r\nis there any complete certainty in these matters; and children resemble\r\ntheir parents or their grandparents, and sometimes they resemble\r\nneither. This is handed down for many generations; as in Sicily, a\r\nwoman cohabited with an Ethiopian, her daughter was not black, but her\r\ndaughter's child was so.\r\n\r\n5. For the most part the girls resemble their mother, and the boys\r\ntheir father; though the contrary is often the case, and the females\r\nresemble their father, and the males their mother, and the different\r\nparts of the body resemble either parents. Twins have sometimes no\r\nresemblance to each other, but they are generally much alike; and one\r\nwoman cohabited with a man, and conceived seven days after parturition,\r\nwhen she bore a child as like her former as if they had been twins.\r\nSome women, as well as other creatures, produce young resembling\r\nthemselves, others bear those which resemble the male, as the horse\r\ncalled Dicæa in Pharsalia.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n1. The seminal fluid in its emission is preceded by wind. The manner of\r\nits emission exhibits this; for nothing is expelled to a great distance\r\nwithout pneumatic force. If the seminal fluid is taken up by the\r\nuterus and retained there, it becomes inclosed in a membrane. For if\r\nit is expelled before it becomes articulated, it appears like an ovum\r\ninclosed in a membrane, but without any shell, and the membrane is full\r\nof veins. All animals, whether furnished with fins, feet, or wings,\r\nwhether viviparous or oviparous, are produced in the same manner,\r\nexcept that the umbilicus in viviparous animals is turned towards the\r\nuterus, and in others to the ovum; and in some cases both ways, as in\r\na certain kind of fish. Some of them are surrounded by a membrane,\r\nothers by a chorion. First of all, the fœtus is contained within the\r\nlast envelope. Then there is another membrane over this, which is in\r\npart united to the matrix and is partly separate, and contains water.\r\nBetween these is a watery or sanguineous fluid, which in women is\r\ncalled prophorus.\r\n\r\n2. All animals that have a navel increase by the navel; and in those\r\nwhich have acetabula the navel is united to the acetabulum; and in\r\nthose which have a smooth uterus the navel is united to the uterus upon\r\na vein. The position of all quadrupeds in the uterus is stretched out;\r\nthat of fishes is on the side; bipeds, as birds, are folded together.\r\nThe human fœtus lies folded up with its nose between its knees and its\r\neyes upon them, and its ears turned outwards. All animals are alike\r\nin having the head placed upwards at first. As they grow, the head\r\nturns round, and the birth of all animals is naturally with the head\r\nforwards: for even in those that are folded together the presentation\r\nof the feet is unnatural. The embryo of quadrupeds contains\r\nexcrementitious matter, as soon as it is matured, both fluid and\r\nsolid. The latter is contained in the extreme parts of the intestine,\r\nthe former in the bladder.\r\n\r\n3. If animals have acetabula in the uterus, these acetabula always\r\nbecome smaller as the fœtus grows, and at last disappear. The umbilical\r\ncord is a covering for veins, of which the origin is in the uterus.\r\nIn those creatures which have acetabula it originates in them; in\r\nthose that have not acetabula it originates in the vein. In the larger\r\nanimals, such as the fœtus of oxen, there are four veins; in smaller\r\nanimals, two; in very small animals, as in birds, there is but one.\r\nTwo veins reach the fœtus through the liver, from that part called the\r\ngates of the liver, towards the great vein; and two go to the aorta,\r\nwhere it is divided into two parts; and there are membranes round each\r\npair of veins, and the umbilical cord surrounds these membranes like a\r\ncovering. As the fœtus increases, these veins diminish. The embryo, as\r\nit grows, advances into the viscera, where its movements are manifest.\r\nSometimes it remains rolled up near the pudendum.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n1. When the pains of parturition come on, they extend to many and\r\nvarious parts of the body, but especially to one or other of the\r\nthighs. Those who suffer most in the bowels are delivered most rapidly;\r\nthose who suffer much in the loins are delivered with difficulty; those\r\nwhose pain lies in the subumbilical region, more quickly. If the child\r\nis a male, a liquid, serum-like discharge, of a pale yellow colour,\r\nprecedes; if a female, this discharge is sanguineous, but still fluid.\r\nSome women have neither during the period of parturition.\r\n\r\n2. In other animals parturition is not painful, and it is evident that\r\nthey suffer but moderately in the pains of labour. In women the pains\r\nof parturition are more violent, especially in those that are inactive\r\nor that are not well made in their sides, and are unable to hold their\r\nbreath. They also suffer more in parturition, if they breathe in the\r\nmeantime, compelled by the necessity of respiration. At first a fluid\r\nescapes when the fœtus comes to the birth, and the membranes are\r\nruptured; after this, the embryo is excluded, the uterus being turned,\r\nand the uterus being turned inside-out.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n1. The division of the umbilical cord often requires the careful\r\nattention of the midwife; for by skilfulness she may not only assist in\r\ndifficult labours, but should attend carefully to the circumstances,\r\nand apply the ligature to the umbilical cord of the child; for if the\r\nsecundines fall out with the child, the umbilical cord must be bound\r\nwith a ligature of worsted, and cut above the ligature, and where it is\r\nbound it joins together, and that which is joined with it falls off. If\r\nthe ligature becomes loose, the child dies from loss of blood. If the\r\nsecundines do not come out at once, while they remain within, and the\r\nchild is outside, the umbilical cord must be tied and divided.\r\n\r\n2. Frequently the child, if weak, has appeared as if born dead, until\r\nthe umbilical cord was tied, for the blood flowed from the child to\r\nthe navel and the surrounding parts; but some skilful midwife being\r\npresent, by pressure on the navel from within has revived the child,\r\njust as if it had been filled with blood from the first. It has been\r\nalready observed, that all animals are naturally born with the head\r\nforwards. Children also have their hands pressed down against their\r\nsides. As soon as they are born they begin to cry and bring their\r\nhands to their mouth. They emit excrements, some immediately, others\r\nvery soon, but all in the course of a day. This excrementitious matter\r\nis very abundant, considering the size of the child. Women call it\r\nthe meconium. Its colour is like that of blood, and it is black and\r\npitch-like. Afterwards it becomes milky, for the child immediately\r\ndraws the breast. The child never cries before it is entirely in the\r\nworld, not even though its head is protruded in difficult cases, while\r\nthe body is within the uterus.\r\n\r\n3. Those women in whom a flooding has preceded the period of delivery\r\nare delivered with more difficulty, and if the purifications are\r\nsmall after parturition, and only as much as they are at first, and\r\ndo not continue for more than forty days, such women are stronger,\r\nand more ready for conception. After children are born, for forty\r\ndays they neither laugh nor weep when awake, but sometimes do both\r\nin their sleep; nor do they usually feel when they are tickled, but\r\nthey sleep the greater part of their time. As they grow, the period of\r\nwakefulness continually increases; and it is evident that they dream,\r\nbut it is some time before they remember their imaginations. There is\r\nno difference in the bones of other animals, but they are all born\r\nperfect. In children the bone called bregma is soft, and does not\r\nbecome strong for some time. Some animals are born with teeth, but\r\nchildren begin to cut their teeth in the seventh month. The front teeth\r\nnaturally appear first, sometimes the upper teeth and sometimes the\r\nunder. Children cut their teeth more easily if their nurses have warmer\r\nmilk.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nAfter parturition and purification women become full of milk; and in\r\nsome it not only flows through the nipples but through other parts of\r\nthe breast, and sometimes from the cheeks; and if this fluid is not\r\nmatured nor secreted, but remains full, hard knots are formed, which\r\nremain for a long time; for every part of the breast is so spongy that,\r\nif a hair is swallowed with the drink, pain ensues in the breasts,\r\nuntil it either escapes spontaneously with the milk, or is sucked out,\r\nthis is called τριχιᾷν. They continue to have milk until they conceive\r\nagain. It then ceases, and is quenched in other creatures as well as\r\nin the human subject. The catamenia seldom take place while milk is\r\nsecreted, though this sometimes occurs in women while nursing. On the\r\nwhole, an effusion of fluid seldom takes place from many parts of the\r\nbody at the same time, and those that have hæmorrhoids have usually\r\nless purification. In some it takes place through ixiæ (varices), and\r\nis secreted from the loins before it reaches the uterus; and those who\r\nvomit blood when the purification is suppressed suffer no harm.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nChildren are very subject to spasms, and especially those that are in\r\na good condition and have abundance of rich milk, or whose nurses are\r\nfat. Wine is injurious in this complaint, and dark-coloured wines more\r\nso than those that are pale, and food that is not fluid, and windy\r\naliments, and stoppage in the bowels. Children with this complaint\r\ngenerally die before the seventh day: wherefore also this day has\r\nreceived a name, as if it gave some hope of the recovery of the child.\r\nChildren suffer most at the full moon. Children are in great danger\r\nwhen the spasms originate in the back, especially if they are advancing\r\nin age.[215]\r\n\r\n[215] The seventh book ends very abruptly, and hence it has been\r\nthought that what is now called the tenth book, in which the subject\r\nof reproduction is continued, would have its proper place here, as a\r\ncontinuation of the seventh. Whether a portion of the genuine work\r\nof Aristotle has been lost which would have completed the subject is\r\nanother question; but there can be little doubt that the tenth book,\r\nin the form in which we have it, is no genuine work of Aristotle; some\r\nof the opinions are contrary to those which he has expressed, and the\r\nwhole style and language is different from that of Aristotle. Schneider\r\ntherefore has placed the tenth book at the end of the work, that he may\r\nneither entirely exclude that which in former times was considered a\r\nportion of Aristotle's treatise on Animals, nor yet allow a fictitious\r\nbook to interrupt the genuine writings of his Author.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THE EIGHTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n1. The nature of animals and their mode of reproduction has now been\r\ndescribed. Their actions and mode of life also differ according to\r\ntheir disposition and their food. For almost all animals present\r\ntraces of their moral dispositions, though these distinctions are most\r\nremarkable in man. For most of them, as we remarked, when speaking\r\nof their various parts, appear to exhibit gentleness or ferocity,\r\nmildness or cruelty, courage or cowardice, fear or boldness, violence\r\nor cunning; and many of them exhibit something like a rational\r\nconsciousness, as we remarked in speaking of their parts. For they\r\ndiffer from man, and man from the other animals, in a greater or less\r\ndegree; for some of these traits are exhibited strongly in man, and\r\nothers in other animals.\r\n\r\n2. Others differ in proportion. For as men exhibit art, wisdom, and\r\nintelligence, animals possess, by way of compensation, some other\r\nphysical power. This is most conspicuous in the examination of infants,\r\nfor in them we see, as it were, the vestiges and seeds of their future\r\ndisposition; nor does their soul at this period differ in any respect\r\nfrom that of an animal; so that it is not unreasonable for animals\r\nto present the same, or similar, or analogous appearances. Nature\r\npasses so gradually from inanimate to animate things, that from their\r\ncontinuity their boundary and the mean between them is indistinct. The\r\nrace of plants succeeds immediately that of inanimate objects; and\r\nthese differ from each other in the proportion of life in which they\r\nparticipate; for, compared with other bodies, plants appear to possess\r\nlife, though, when compared with animals, they appear inanimate.\r\n\r\n3. The change from plants to animals, however, is gradual, as I before\r\nobserved. For a person might question to which of these classes some\r\nmarine objects belong; for many of them are attached to the rock, and\r\nperish as soon as they are separated from it. The pinnæ are attached to\r\nthe rocks, the solens cannot live after they are taken away from their\r\nlocalities; and, on the whole, all the testacea resemble plants, if\r\nwe compare them with locomotive animals. Some of them appear to have\r\nno sensation; in others it is very dull. The body of some of them is\r\nnaturally fleshy, as of those which are called tethya; and the acalephe\r\nand the sponge entirely resemble plants; the progress is always gradual\r\nby which one appears to have more life and motion than another.\r\n\r\n4. In the vital actions also we may observe the same manner. For\r\nvegetables which are produced from seed appear to have no other work\r\nbeyond reproduction; nor do some animals appear to have any other\r\nobject in their existence. This object then is common to them all; but\r\nas sensation advances, their manner of life differs in their having\r\npleasure in sexual intercourse, in their mode of parturition and\r\nrearing their young. Some of them, like plants, simply accomplish their\r\npeculiar mode of reproduction at an appointed season, and others are\r\ndiligent in rearing their young; but as soon as this is accomplished\r\nthey separate from them, and have no farther communication; but those\r\nthat are more intelligent, and possess more memory, use their offspring\r\nin a more civilized manner.\r\n\r\n5. The work of reproduction is one part of their life, the work of\r\nprocuring food forms another. These two occupy their labour and their\r\nlife. Their food differs in the substances of which it consists, and\r\nall the natural increase of the body is derived from food. That which\r\nis natural is pleasant, and all animals follow that which is pleasant\r\nto their nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n1. Animals are divided according to the localities which they inhabit;\r\nfor some animals are terrestrial, others are aquatic. They also admit\r\nof a ternary division, those that breathe air and those that breathe\r\nwater, one of these classes is terrestrial, the other is aquatic; the\r\nthird class does not breathe either air or water, but they are adapted\r\nby nature to receive refreshment from each of these elements; and some\r\nof these are called terrestrial, others are aquatic, though they\r\nneither breathe air or water; and there are other animals which procure\r\ntheir food and make their abode in either of these elements. For many\r\nthat breathe air, and produce their young upon the land, procure their\r\nfood from the water, where they generally make their abode; and these\r\nare the only animals which appear to be doubtful, for they may be\r\narranged either as terrestrial or aquatic animals.\r\n\r\n2. Of those that breathe water, none have feet or wings, nor seek their\r\nfood on land; but many of those that are terrestrial, and breathe\r\nair, do so; some of them so much so, that they cannot live when\r\nseparated from the water, as those which are called marine turtles,\r\nand crocodiles, and hippopotami, and seals, and some of the smaller\r\ncreatures, as the water tortoise and the frog tribe; for all these are\r\nsuffocated if their respiration is suspended for any length of time.\r\nThey produce their young and rear them on dry land; others do so near\r\nthe dry land, while they reside in the water.\r\n\r\n3. Of all animals the most remarkable in this particular is the\r\ndolphin, and some other aquatic animals and cetacea which are of this\r\nhabit, as the whale and others which have a blowhole; for it is not\r\neasy to arrange them either with aquatic or terrestrial animals, if\r\nwe consider animals that breathe air as terrestrial, and those that\r\nbreathe water as aquatics, for they partake of the characters of\r\nboth classes; for they receive the sea and eject it through their\r\nblowhole, and air through their lungs, for they have this part, and\r\nbreathe through it. And the dolphin, when captured in nets, is often\r\nsuffocated, from the impossibility of breathing. It will live for a\r\nlong while out of water, snoring and groaning like other breathing\r\nanimals. It sleeps with its snout above the water, in order that it may\r\nbreathe through it.\r\n\r\n4. It is thus impossible to arrange it under both of these contrary\r\ndivisions, but it would appear that the aquatic animals must be further\r\nsubdivided; for they breathe and eject water for the same reason as\r\nothers breathe air, for the sake of coolness. Other animals do this\r\nfor the sake of food; for those animals which obtain their food in the\r\nwater, must also, at the same time, swallow some of the fluid, and have\r\nan organ by which they can eject it. Those creatures which use water\r\ninstead of air for breathing have gills; those that use it for food\r\nhave a blowhole. These creatures are sanguineous. The nature of the\r\nmalacia and malacostraca is the same; for these swallow water for food.\r\n\r\n5. Those animals which breathe air, but live in the water, and those\r\nwhich breathe water, and have gills, but go out upon dry land and take\r\ntheir food there, belong to two divisions of aquatic animals. This last\r\ndivision is represented by a single animal called the cordylus (water\r\nnewt); for this animal has no lungs, but gills; and it goes on dry\r\nland to procure its food. It has four feet, so that it appears natural\r\nthat it should walk. In all these animals nature appears to be, as it\r\nwere, turned aside, and some of the males appear to be females, and\r\nthe females have a male appearance; for animals which have but small\r\ndiversity in particular parts, exhibit great variations in the whole\r\nbody.\r\n\r\n6. This is evident in castrated animals; for if a small portion only of\r\nthe body is destroyed, the animal becomes a female; so that it is plain\r\nthat if a very minute portion in the original composition of an animal\r\nbecomes changed, if that portion belongs to the origin of the species,\r\nit might become either male or female; or, if taken away altogether,\r\nthe animal might be neuter. And so, either way, it might become a land\r\nor aquatic animal, if only a small change took place ... it happens\r\nthat some become terrestrial and others aquatic animals, and some are\r\nnot amphibious which others are, because in their original generation\r\nthey received some kind of substance which they use for food. For that\r\nwhich is natural is agreeable to every animal, as I have said before.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n1. When animals are divided in three ways into aquatic and land\r\nanimals, because they either breathe air or water, or from the\r\ncomposition of their bodies; or, in the third place, from their food,\r\ntheir manner of life will be found to agree with these divisions. For\r\nsome follow both the composition of their bodies and the nature of\r\ntheir food, and their respiration of either water or air. Others only\r\nagree with their composition and food.\r\n\r\n2. The testacea which are immoveable live by a fluid which percolates\r\nthrough the dense parts of the sea, and being digested because it\r\nis lighter than the sea water, thus returns to its original nature.\r\nThat this fluid exists in the sea, and is capable of infiltration is\r\nmanifest, and may be proved by experiment; for if anyone will make a\r\nthin waxen vessel, and sink it empty in the sea, in a night and a day,\r\nit may be taken up full of water, which is drinkable.\r\n\r\n3. The acalephe (actinia) feeds upon any small fish which may fall in\r\nits way. Its mouth is placed in the centre of its body. This organ\r\nis conspicuous in the larger individuals: like the oyster, it has a\r\npassage for the exclusion of its food, which is placed above. The\r\nacalephe appears to resemble the internal part of the oyster, and it\r\nmakes use of the rock, as the oyster does of its shell. (The patella\r\nalso is free, and wanders about in search of food.)\r\n\r\n4. Among the locomotive testacea, some are carnivorous, and live on\r\nsmall fish, as the purpura, for this creature is carnivorous, it is\r\ntherefore caught with a bait of flesh: others live upon marine plants.\r\nThe marine turtles live upon shell-fish, for which purpose they have a\r\nvery powerful mouth; for if any of them take a stone or anything else,\r\nthey break and eat it. This animal leaves the water and eats grass.\r\nThey often suffer and perish, when they are dried up as they float on\r\nthe surface, for they are not able to dive readily.\r\n\r\n5. The malacostraca are of the same nature, for they eat everything;\r\nthey feed upon stones and mud, seaweeds and dung, as the rock crabs,\r\nand are also carnivorous. The spiny lobsters also overcome large\r\nfishes, and a kind of retribution awaits them in turn, for the polypus\r\nprevails over the lobster, for they are not inconvenienced by the shell\r\nof the lobster, so that if the lobsters perceive them in the same net\r\nwith them, they die from fear. The spiny lobsters overcome the congers,\r\nfor their roughness prevents them from falling off. The congers devour\r\nthe polypi which cannot adhere to them on account of the smoothness of\r\ntheir surface; all the malacia are carnivorous.\r\n\r\n6. The spiny lobsters also live on small fish, which they hunt for in\r\ntheir holes, for they are produced in such parts of the sea as are\r\nrough and stony, and in those places make their habitations; whatever\r\nthey capture, they bring to their mouth with their double claw, as the\r\ncrabs do. When not frightened they naturally walk forwards, hanging\r\ntheir horns down at their sides. When alarmed they retreat backwards,\r\nand extend their horns to a great distance. They fight with each other\r\nlike rams with their horns, raising them and striking each other. They\r\nare often seen in numbers as if they were gregarious.\r\n\r\n7. The malacostraca lead this kind of life. Among the malacia the\r\nteuthis and sepia prevail over the large fish. The polypus generally\r\ncollects shells which it empties of their contents and feeds upon them,\r\nso that those who seek for them find their holes by the shells that are\r\nscattered about. The report that they eat each other is a mistake; but\r\nsome have the tentacula eaten off by the congers.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n1. All fish at the season of oviposition live upon ova; in the rest of\r\ntheir food they are not all so well agreed, for some of them are only\r\ncarnivorous, as the selachos, conger, channa, thynnus, labrax, sinodon,\r\namia, orphus, and muræna; the trigla lives upon fuci, shell-fish, and\r\nmud; it is also carnivorous. The cephalus lives on mud, the dascillus\r\non mud and dung. The scarus and melanurus on sea-weed, the salpa on\r\ndung and fuci, it will also eat the plant called horehound; it is the\r\nonly fish that can be caught with the gourd.\r\n\r\n2. All fish, except the cestreus, eat one another, especially the\r\ncongers. The cephalus and the cestreus alone are not carnivorous. This\r\nis a proof of it. They are never captured with anything of the kind in\r\ntheir stomach, nor are they captured with a bait made of flesh, but\r\nwith bread; the cestreus is always fed upon sea-weed and sand. One\r\nkind of cephalus which some persons call chelone lives near the land,\r\nanother is called peræas. This last feeds upon nothing but its own\r\nmucus, for which reason it is always very poor. The cephalus lives upon\r\nmud, wherefore they are heavy and slimy. They certainly never eat fish,\r\non account of their dwelling in mud; they often emerge in order to wash\r\nthemselves from the slime. Neither will any creature eat their ova, so\r\nthat they increase rapidly, and when they increase they are devoured\r\nby other fish, and especially by the acharnus.\r\n\r\n3. The cestreus (mullet) is the most greedy and insatiable of fish, so\r\nthat its abdomen is distended, and it is not good for food unless it is\r\npoor. When alarmed it hides its head, as if its whole body were thus\r\nconcealed; the sinodon also is carnivorous, and eats the malacia. This\r\nfish and the channa often eject their stomachs as they pursue small\r\nfish, for their stomach is near the mouth, and they have no œsophagus.\r\nSome are simply carnivorous, as the dolphin, sinodon, chrysophrys, the\r\nselache and malacia; others, as the phycis, cobius, and the rock-fish,\r\nprincipally feed upon mud and fuci, and bryum, and what is called\r\ncaulion, and any matter which may be produced in the sea. The phycis\r\neats no other flesh than that of the shrimps. They also frequently eat\r\neach other, as I before remarked, and the greater devour the less. It\r\nis a proof that they are carnivorous, that they are captured with bait\r\nmade of flesh.\r\n\r\n4. The amia, tunny, and labrax generally eat flesh, though they also\r\neat sea-weed. The sargus feeds after the trigla when the last has\r\nburied itself in the mud and departed, for it has the power of burying\r\nitself, then the sargus comes and feeds and prevents all those that are\r\nweaker than itself from approaching. The fish called scarus is the only\r\none which appears to ruminate like quadrupeds. Other fish appear to\r\nhunt the smaller ones with their mouths towards them, in this way they\r\nnaturally swim; but the selachea, dolphins and cetacea throw themselves\r\non their back to capture their prey, for their mouth is placed below\r\nthem, for this reason the smaller ones escape, or if not they would\r\nsoon be reduced in number; for the swiftness of the dolphin and its\r\ncapacity for food appear incredible.\r\n\r\n5. A few eels in some places are fed upon mud, and any kind of food\r\nwhich may be cast into the water, but generally they live upon fresh\r\nwater, and those who rear eels take care that the water which flows off\r\nand on upon the shallows in which they live may be clear, where they\r\nmake the eel preserves. For they are soon suffocated if the water is\r\nnot clean, their gills being very small. For this reason those who seek\r\nfor them disturb the water. In the Strymon they are taken about the\r\ntime of the rising of the Pleiades. For the water is disturbed at this\r\nseason by the mud which is stirred up by contrary winds, otherwise it\r\nis useless to attempt to obtain them. When dead, eels do not rise and\r\nfloat on the surface, like other fishes, for their stomach is small; a\r\nfew of them are fat, but this is not usually the case.\r\n\r\n6. When taken out of the water, they will live five or six days; if\r\nthe wind is in the north they will live longer than if it is in the\r\nsouth. If they are removed from the ponds to the eel preserves during\r\nthe summer they perish, but not if removed in the winter; neither will\r\nthey bear violent changes, for if they are taken and plunged into cold\r\nwater, they often perish in great numbers. They are suffocated also if\r\nkept in a small quantity of water. This takes place also in other fish,\r\nwhich are suffocated if kept in a small quantity of water which is\r\nnever changed, like animals which breathe air when enclosed in a small\r\nquantity of air. Some eels live seven or eight years. Fresh-water fish\r\nmake use of food, and devour each other, as well as plants and roots,\r\nor anything else that they can find in the mud; they generally feed in\r\nthe night, and during the day dwell in deep holes. This is the nature\r\nof the food of fish.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n1. All birds with crooked claws are carnivorous, nor are they able to\r\neat corn even when put in their mouths. All the eagles belong to this\r\nclass and the kites, and both the hawks, the pigeon hawk namely, and\r\nthe sparrow hawk. These differ in size from each other, and so does the\r\ntriorches. This bird is as large as the kite, and is visible at all\r\nseasons of the year; the osprey and vulture also belong to this class.\r\nThe osprey is as large as the eagle, and ash-coloured. There are two\r\nkinds of vultures, one small and whitish, the other large and cinereous.\r\n\r\n2. Some of the night birds also have crooked claws, as the nycticorax,\r\nowl, and bryas. The bryas resembles an owl in appearance, but it is as\r\nlarge as an eagle; the eleos, ægolius, and scops also belong to this\r\nclass. The eleos is larger than a domestic fowl, the ægolius is about\r\nthe size of that bird, they both hunt the jay. The scops is less than\r\nthe owl; all three of these are similar in form, and carnivorous. Some\r\nthat have not crooked claws are carnivorous, as the swallow.\r\n\r\n3. Some birds feed on worms, as the finch, the sparrow, batis,\r\nchloris, titmouse. There are three kinds of titmouse; the spizites\r\nis the largest, it is as large as the finch. Another is called the\r\norinus, because it dwells in mountains; it has a large tail. The third\r\nresembles them in everything except its size, for it is very small.\r\nThe sycalis also, the megalocoryphus, pyrrhulas, erithacus, hypolaïs,\r\nœstrus, tyrannis are of this class. The last of these is the least,\r\nit is not much larger than a locust; it has a purple crest, and is\r\naltogether a graceful and well-formed bird. The bird called anthus\r\nalso, which is of the size of the finch; the orospizus is like the\r\nfinch, and nearly of the same size, it has a blue stripe on its neck,\r\nand lives in mountainous places. The wren also lives upon seeds. All\r\nthese and such like birds either partly or entirely live on worms.\r\n\r\n4. These birds, the acanthis, thraupis, and that which is called\r\nchrysometris, all live upon thorns, but neither eat worms or any other\r\nliving creature, and they both roost and feed in the same places.\r\nThere are others which feed on gnats; these live chiefly by hunting\r\nfor these insects, as the greater and lesser pipo, both of which are\r\nby some persons called woodpeckers. They resemble each other in their\r\ncry, though that of the larger bird is the louder, and they both feed\r\nby flying against trees. The celeos also, which is as large as a turtle\r\ndove, and entirely yellow; its habit is to strike against trees; it\r\ngenerally lives upon trees, and has a loud voice. This bird generally\r\ninhabits the Peloponnesus. There is also another called cnipologus,\r\nwhich is small, about the size of the acanthyllis; its colour is\r\ncinereous and spotted, and its voice is weak; this bird also pecks\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\n5. There are other birds which live upon fruit and grasses, as the\r\nphaps, phatta, peristera, œnas, and trygon.[216] The phatta and\r\nperistera are always present, the trygon only in summer time; in the\r\nwinter it is not seen, for it hides itself in holes. The œnas is\r\ngenerally seen and captured in the autumn. The œnas is as large as the\r\nperistera but less than the phaps. It is generally captured as it is\r\ndrinking; it comes to this country when it has young. All the rest come\r\nin the summer, and make their nests here, and all, except the pigeon\r\ntribe, live upon animal food.\r\n\r\n[216] Different species of pigeons and doves.\r\n\r\n6. All birds, as far as food is concerned, are either terrestrial or\r\nlive in the neighbourhood of rivers and ponds, or near the sea. Those\r\nthat have webbed feet pass the greater part of their time on the water;\r\nthose with divided feet near the water. Some of these dive for their\r\nfood, such as live upon plants and do not eat flesh; others, as the\r\nheron and white heron, live in ponds and rivers. The latter of these is\r\nsmaller than the former, and has a flat large bill.\r\n\r\n7. The pelargus also, and the gull, the latter is ash-coloured, and the\r\nschœnilus, cinclos, pygargus, (and tryngas) this last is the largest of\r\nthese small birds, for it is of the same size as the thrush; all these\r\nbirds wag their tails. The calidris also, this bird is variegated and\r\nash-coloured. The kingfisher also lives near the water; there appear to\r\nbe two kinds of this bird, one of which utters its cry as it sits upon\r\nthe reeds, and the other, which is larger, is silent; they both have\r\na blue back. The trochilus also, and the kingfisher and cerylus also\r\nlive near the sea. The corona also lives upon animals which are cast on\r\nshore, for it is omnivorous. The white gull also, the cepphus, æthyia,\r\nand charadrius.\r\n\r\n8. The heavier web-footed birds inhabit the neighbourhood of rivers and\r\nponds, as the swan, duck, phalaris, columbis, and the boscas, which\r\nis like a duck, but smaller; and the bird called corax, which is as\r\nlarge as the pelargus, but its legs are shorter, it is web-footed and\r\na swimmer, its colour is black; this last bird perches upon trees, and\r\nis the only one of this class that builds its nest in such places. The\r\ngreat and small goose also, the latter is gregarious, and chenalopex,\r\nthe aix, and the penelops. The sea eagle also lives near the sea, and\r\nfishes in the waters of lakes. Many birds are omnivorous; those with\r\ncrooked claws seize upon other animals which they can overcome, and\r\nupon birds. They do not, however, devour their own congeners, as fish\r\nfrequently do; all the tribes of birds drink very little, those with\r\ncrooked claws do not drink at all, or only a few of them, and these but\r\nseldom; of these the cenchris drinks the most; the kite rarely drinks,\r\nthough it has been observed to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n1. Animals covered with scaly plates, as the lizard and other\r\nquadrupeds and serpents, are omnivorous, for they eat both flesh and\r\ngrass, and serpents lick their prey more than any other animal; all\r\nthese creatures, and indeed all with spongy lungs, drink very little,\r\nand all that are oviparous are of this kind, and have but little blood.\r\nSerpents are all very fond of wine, so that they hunt the viper by\r\nplacing vessels of wine in the hedge-rows, and they are captured when\r\nintoxicated. Serpents devour any animal that they may have captured,\r\nand when they have sucked out the juice, they reject all the remainder;\r\nnearly all such animals do this, as also the spiders. But the spiders\r\nsuck the juice without swallowing the animal. Serpents suck the juice\r\ninternally.\r\n\r\n2. The serpent swallows any food which may be presented to it, for it\r\nwill devour both birds and beasts, and suck eggs. When it has taken\r\nits food it draws itself up, till it stands erect upon its extremity,\r\nit then gathers itself up and contracts itself a little, so that when\r\nstretched out the animal it has swallowed may descend in its stomach;\r\nit does this because its œsophagus is long and thin. Phalangia and\r\nserpents can live a long while without food, this may be seen in those\r\nthat are kept by dealers in medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n1. Among viviparous quadrupeds, those that are wild and have pointed\r\nteeth are all carnivorous, except some wolves, which, when they are\r\nhungry, will, as they say, eat a certain kind of earth, but this is the\r\nonly exception. They will not eat grass unless they are sick, for some\r\ndogs eat grass and vomit it up again, and so are purified. The solitary\r\nwolves are more eager for human flesh than those which hunt in packs.\r\n\r\n2. The animal which some persons call the glanus and others the hyæna,\r\nis not less than the wolf, it has a mane like a horse, but the hair all\r\nalong its spine is more harsh and thick. It also secretly attacks men,\r\nand hunts them down; it hunts dogs also by vomiting like men; it also\r\nbreaks open graves for the sake of this kind of food.\r\n\r\n3. The bear is also omnivorous, for it eats fruit, and on account of\r\nthe softness of its body it can climb trees; it eats leguminous seeds\r\nalso; it also overturns hives and eats the honey, and it feeds upon\r\ncrabs and ants, and is carnivorous, for its strength enables it to\r\nattack not only deer, but wild hogs, if it can fall upon them secretly,\r\nand oxen. For when it meets the bull face to face, it falls upon its\r\nback, and when the bull attempts to throw it, seizes its horns with its\r\nfore-legs, and biting upon the shoulder of the bull, throws it down.\r\nFor a short time it can walk upright on its hind legs. It eats flesh\r\nafter it has become putrid.\r\n\r\n4. The lion, like all other wild animals with pointed teeth, is\r\ncarnivorous; it devours its food greedily, and swallows large pieces\r\nwithout dividing them; it can afterwards, from its repletion, remain\r\ntwo or three days without food. It drinks very little. Its excrement\r\nis small, and is not made more than once in three days or thereabouts,\r\nand it is dry and hard like that of a dog. The wind from its bowels has\r\nan acrid smell, and its urine is powerfully scented, for which reason\r\ndogs smell to trees, for the lion, like the dog, lifts its leg to make\r\nwater. It produces also a strong smell when it breathes upon its food,\r\nand when its bowels are laid open they emit a strong scent.\r\n\r\n5. Some quadrupeds and wild animals seek their food in the\r\nneighbourhood of ponds and rivers, but none of them except the seal\r\nlive near the sea; of this class are the creature called beaver, and\r\nthe satherium, the satyrium, the otter, and that which is called latax.\r\nThis creature is broader than the enydris, and has strong teeth, for it\r\noften goes out in the night and with its teeth gnaws off the osiers.\r\nThe enydris also will bite men, and they say will not leave its hold\r\ntill it hears the noise of its teeth against the bone. The latax has\r\nrough hair, the nature of which is between that of the seal and that of\r\nthe deer.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n1. Animals with pointed teeth drink by lapping, and some that have not\r\npointed teeth, as mice. Those which have an even surface to their teeth\r\ndraw in the water as horses and oxen; the bear neither draws in the\r\nwater nor laps it, but gulps it down. Some birds draw in the water, but\r\nthose which have long necks imbibe it at intervals, lifting up their\r\nheads; the porphyrion alone gulps it down. All horned animals, both\r\ndomestic and wild, and those that have not pointed teeth eat fruits and\r\ngrass, and are incapable of enduring hunger, except the dog, and this\r\nanimal eats fruit and grass less than any other.\r\n\r\n2. The hog eats roots more than other animals, because its snout is\r\nwell adapted for this operation, it is more adapted to various kinds\r\nof food than other animals. In proportion to its size its fat is\r\ndeveloped very fast, for it becomes fat in sixty days. Those who occupy\r\nthemselves in fatting hogs know how fast they fatten by weighing them\r\nwhen lean; they will become fat after starvation for three days. Almost\r\nall other animals become fat, after previous starvation. After three\r\ndays those who fatten hogs feed them well.\r\n\r\n3. The Thracians fatten them by giving them drink on the first day,\r\nthen at first they omit one day, afterwards two, three, or four, till\r\nthey reach to seven days. These creatures are fattened with barley,\r\nmillet, figs, acorns, wild pears, and cucumbers. Both this and other\r\nanimals with a warm stomach are fattened in idleness, and the sow\r\nalso by wallowing in the mire. They prefer different kinds of food at\r\ndifferent ages. The hog and the wolf fight together, a sixth part of\r\nits weight when alive, consists of bristles, blood, and fat. Sows and\r\nall other animals grow lean while suckling their young. This then, is\r\nthe nature of these animals.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n1. Oxen eat both fruits and grass. They become fat on flatulent food,\r\nas vetches, broken beans, and stems of beans, and if any person having\r\ncut a hole in the skin inflates them and then feeds the older cattle,\r\nthey fatten more rapidly, and either on whole or broken barley, or on\r\nsweet food, as on figs and grapes, wine, and the leaves of the elm, and\r\nespecially in the sunshine and in warm waters. The horns of the calf,\r\nif anointed with wax, may be directed in any way that is desired, and\r\nthey suffer less in the feet if their horns are rubbed with wax, or\r\npitch, or oil.\r\n\r\n2. Herds of cattle suffer less when moved in frost than in snow. They\r\ngrow if they are deprived for a long time of sexual intercourse;\r\nwherefore the herdsmen in Epirus keep the Pyrrhic cattle, as they are\r\ncalled, for nine years without sexual intercourse, in order that they\r\nmay grow. They call such cows apotauri. The number of these creatures\r\nreaches four hundred, and they are the property of the king. They will\r\nnot live in any other country, though the attempt has been made.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n1. The horse, mule, and ass feed upon fruit and grass, but they\r\nfatten especially on drinking, so that beasts of burden enjoy their\r\nfood in proportion to the quantity of water which they drink, and the\r\nless difficulty there is of obtaining drink, the more they profit by\r\nabundance of grass. When the mare is in foal, green food causes her\r\nhair to be fine, but when it contains hard knots it is not wholesome.\r\nThe first crop of Medic grass is not good, nor if any stinking water\r\nhas come near it, for it gives it a bad smell. Oxen require pure water\r\nto drink, but horses in this respect resemble camels. The camel prefers\r\nwater that is dirty and thick; nor will it drink from a stream before\r\nit has disturbed the water. It can remain without drinking four days,\r\nafter which it drinks a great quantity.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n1. The elephant can eat more than nine Macedonian medimni at one meal,\r\nbut so much food at once is dangerous; it should not have altogether\r\nmore than six or seven medimni, or five medimni of bread, and five\r\nmares of wine, the maris measures six cotylæ. An elephant has been\r\nknown to drink as much as fourteen Macedonian measures at once, and\r\neight more again in the evening. Many camels live thirty years, and\r\nsome much more, for they have been known to live an hundred years. Some\r\nsay that the elephant lives two hundred, and others three hundred years.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n1. Sheep and goats live upon grass. Sheep pasture for a long while\r\nin one place without leaving it, but goats change their places very\r\nsoon, and only crop the top of the grass. The sheep fatten rapidly\r\nwith drinking, and for this reason during summer they give them\r\nsalt, a medimnus to each hundred sheep; for in this manner the flock\r\nbecomes more healthy and fat, and frequently they collect and bring\r\nthem together for this purpose, that they may mix a great deal of\r\nsalt with their food; for when thirsty they drink the more. And in\r\nthe autumn they feed them with gourds which they have sprinkled with\r\nsalt, for this makes them give more milk. When driven about in the heat\r\nof the day they drink more towards evening. If fed with salt after\r\nparturition, the udder becomes larger.\r\n\r\n2. Sheep fatten on green shoots, vetches, and all kinds of grass, and\r\nthey fatten more rapidly when their food is salted. They fatten more\r\nrapidly if previously starved for three days. During autumn northern\r\nwater is better for sheep than southern, and pastures towards the\r\nwest are good for them. Long journeys and weariness make them lean.\r\nShepherds distinguish the strong sheep during winter by the frost\r\nadhering to their wool, which is not the case with those that are sick;\r\nfor those that are not strong move about in their weakness and shake it\r\noff.\r\n\r\n3. The flesh of all quadrupeds which feed in marshy grounds is\r\ninferior to that of those which live on high ground. Sheep with wide\r\ntails endure the winter better than those with long tails, and short\r\nwoolled-sheep better than long-woolled, and those with curly wool are\r\nmore affected by the cold. Sheep are more healthy than goats, though\r\ngoats are the stronger. The fleece and the wool of sheep which have\r\nbeen devoured by wolves, and garments made of such wool are more\r\nsubject to vermin than others.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n1. Those insects which have teeth are omnivorous, but those which have\r\na tongue only live upon fluids, which they collect from all sources\r\nwith this organ. Some of these are omnivorous, for they feed upon all\r\nkinds of fluids, as the fly. Others only suck blood, as the myops and\r\nœstrus. Others, again, live upon the juices of plants and fruit. The\r\nbee is the only insect that never touches anything putrid. It uses\r\nno food that has not a sweet taste. They also take very sweet water,\r\nwherever they fall upon any that is pure. The different kinds of\r\nanimals then use these kinds of food.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n1. All the actions of animals are employed either in sexual\r\nintercourse, or in rearing their young, or in procuring food for\r\nthemselves, or in providing against excessive heat and cold, and the\r\nchanges of the seasons. For they all have naturally a sensitiveness\r\nrespecting heat and cold, and, like mankind, who either change their\r\nabodes in cold weather, or those who have large estates, pass their\r\nsummer in cold countries and their winter in warm ones; so animals,\r\nalso, if they can, migrate from place to place. Some of them find\r\nprotection in their accustomed localities, others are migratory; and at\r\nthe autumnal equinox, escape at the approach of winter, from the Pontus\r\nand other cold places; and in spring retreat again before the approach\r\nof summer from hot to cold countries, for they are afraid of excessive\r\nheat. Some migrate from places close at hand, and others from the very\r\nends of the earth.\r\n\r\n2. The cranes do this, for they travel from Scythia to the marshes in\r\nthe higher parts of Egypt, from which the Nile originates. This is\r\nthe place where the Pygmies dwell; and this is no fable, for there is\r\nreally, as it is said, a race of dwarfs, both men and horses, which\r\nlead the life of troglodites. The pelicans also are migratory, and\r\nleave the river Strymon for the Ister, where they rear their young.\r\nThey depart in great crowds, and those that are before wait for those\r\nbehind, for in flying over the mountains those behind cannot see the\r\nleaders.\r\n\r\n3. The fish also, in the same manner, migrate either from or to the\r\nPontus, and in winter they leave the deep water for the sake of the\r\nwarmth of the shore, and in summer they escape from the heat by\r\nmigrating from the shore into deep water. Delicate birds, also, in\r\nwinter and frosty weather, descend from the mountains to the plains,\r\nfor the sake of the warmth; and in summer they return again to the\r\nmountains for fear of the heat.\r\n\r\n4. Those that are the most delicate are the first to make the change\r\nat each extreme of heat and cold, such as the mackerel migrate sooner\r\nthan the tunnies, and the quails than cranes; for some migrate in\r\nAugust, others in September. They are always fatter when they migrate\r\nfrom cold countries, than when they leave warm countries, as the quail\r\nis more fat in the autumn than the spring: and so it happens that they\r\nmigrate alike from cold countries and from warm seasons. Their sexual\r\ndesires are also more violent in the spring, and when they leave warm\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n5. Among birds, as it was previously remarked, the crane migrates from\r\none extremity of the earth to the other, and they fly against the wind.\r\nAs for the story about the stone, it is a fiction, for they say that\r\nthey carry a stone as ballast, which is useful as a touchstone for\r\ngold, after they have vomited it up. The phatta and the peleias leave\r\nus, and do not winter with us, nor does the turtle; but the pigeon\r\nstays through the winter. The same is the nature of the quail, unless\r\na few individuals both of the turtle and quail remain behind in sunny\r\nspots. The phatta and turtle assemble in large flocks when they depart,\r\nand again at the season of their return. The quails, when they commence\r\ntheir flight, if the weather is fine and the wind in the north, go in\r\npairs, and have a successful voyage. If the wind is south it goes hard\r\nwith them, for their flight is slow, and this wind is moist and heavy.\r\nThose that hunt them, therefore, pursue them when the wind is in the\r\nsouth, but not in fine weather. They fly badly on account of their\r\nweight, for their body is large. They therefore make a noise as they\r\nfly, for it is a toil to them.\r\n\r\n6. When they come hither they have no leader, but when they depart\r\nhence, the glottis, ortygometra, otus, and cychramus, which calls them\r\ntogether at night, accompany them; and when the fowlers hear this\r\nsound, they know that they will not remain. The ortygometra in form\r\nresembles the birds which inhabit marshes. The glottis has a tongue\r\nwhich it projects to a great length. The otus resembles an owl, and has\r\nsmall feathers at its ears. Some persons call it the nycticorax, it is\r\nmischievous and imitative, it is taken like the owl, as it dances from\r\nside to side, one or other of the fowlers compassing it about. On the\r\nwhole birds with crooked claws have short necks, broad tongues, and a\r\ncapacity for imitation. And so has the Indian bird, the parrot, which\r\nis said to have a tongue like a man. It becomes the most loquacious\r\nwhen intoxicated. The crow, the swan, the pelican, and the small goose,\r\nare gregarious birds.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n1. It has already been observed that fish migrate from the deep water\r\nto the coast, and from the coast to the deep water, in order to avoid\r\nthe excesses of cold and heat. Those that frequent the neighbourhood\r\nof the coast are better than those from deep water, for the feeding\r\ngrounds are better and more abundant. For wherever the sun strikes\r\nthe plants are more frequent, and superior, and more delicate, as in\r\ngardens, and the black shore-weed grows near the land, and the other\r\nkinds rather resemble uncultivated plants. The neighbourhood of the\r\ncoast is also more temperate, both in heat and cold, than the rest of\r\nthe sea; for which reason the flesh of fish which live near the shore\r\nis more compact, while that of fish from deep sea is watery and soft.\r\nThe sinodon, cantharus, orphos, chrysophrys, cestreus, trigla, cichla,\r\ndracon, callionymus, cobius, and all the rock fish live near the shore.\r\nThe trygon, selache, the white congers, the channa, erythrinus, and\r\nglaucus inhabit deep water. The phagrus, scorpius, the black conger,\r\nthe muræna, and coccyx occupy either situation indifferently.\r\n\r\n2. They vary also in different places; as in the neighbourhood of Crete\r\nthe cobius and all the rock fish are fat. The tunny also becomes good\r\nagain after Arcturus, for it is not tormented by the œstrus after that\r\nperiod; for which reason also it is inferior during the summer. In\r\nlakes near the sea also there are several kinds of fish, as the salpa,\r\nchrysophrys, trigla, and nearly all the rest. The amia also is found in\r\nsuch situations as in the vicinity of Alopeconnesus, and in the lake\r\nof Bistonis there are many fish. Many of the coliæ do not enter the\r\nPontus; but they pass the summer and rear their young in the Propontis,\r\nand winter in the Ægean. The thynnus, pelamis, and amia enter the\r\nPontus in the spring and pass the summer there, and so do nearly all\r\nthe rhyades and the gregarious fish. Many fish are gregarious, and\r\ngregarious fish have a leader of the shoal.\r\n\r\n3. They all enter the Pontus for the sake of the food (for the pasture\r\nis more abundant and superior, on account of the fresh water), and\r\nfor fear of the large creatures, which are smaller there; and except\r\nthe phocona and dolphin, there is no other found in the Pontus; and\r\nthe dolphin is small, but when we leave the Pontus we find a larger\r\ndolphin. They enter this sea for the sake of food and rearing their\r\nyoung; for the situation is better for this purpose, and the fresh\r\nsweet water nourishes the young fry. When they have reared their young,\r\nand the fry begin to grow, they migrate immediately after the Pleiades.\r\nIf the south wind blow during the winter, they leave the place more\r\nslowly; but with a north wind they swim faster, for then the wind\r\nhelps them along. The small fry is captured in the neighbourhood of\r\nByzantium, for they make no long stay in the Pontus.\r\n\r\n4. The other fish are seen both in their egress and ingress. The\r\ntrichia is only seen as it enters, and is not observed to leave again;\r\nand if one is captured at Byzantium, the fishermen purify their nets,\r\nfor it is unusual for them to return. The reason is this: these are the\r\nonly fish that swim up into the Ister, and when this river divides they\r\nswim down into the Adriatic. The following is a proof; for the converse\r\nhappens here, and they are never captured entering the Adriatic, but as\r\nthey leave it.\r\n\r\n5. The tunnies, as they enter, swim with their right side to the shore,\r\nand leave with their left side to the shore; and some persons say\r\nthat they do this because they see better with their right eye, and\r\ntheir sight is naturally dim. The rhyades move during the day, and in\r\nthe night remain quiet and feed, unless the moon is bright, in which\r\ncase they continue their journey and do not rest themselves. And some\r\npersons engaged about the sea say that after the winter solstice they\r\ndo not move, but remain quiet wherever they may be till the equinox.\r\n\r\n6. The coliæ are taken as they enter, but not as they return. The\r\nbest are taken in the Propontis before the breeding season. The other\r\nrhyades are captured more frequently as they leave the Pontus, and are\r\nthen in perfection. Those that swim near the shore are the fattest\r\nwhen captured; and the farther they are away, the more lean they are;\r\nand frequently, when the south wind blows, they swim out in company\r\nwith the coliæ and mackerel, and are taken lower down rather than at\r\nByzantium. This is the nature of their migrations.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n1. Land animals have also the same disposition for concealment. For in\r\nwinter they all hasten to conceal themselves, and appear again when\r\nthe season becomes warmer. Animals conceal themselves to guard against\r\nthe excesses of temperature. In some the whole race is concealed; in\r\nothers only a part of them. All the testacea conceal themselves, as\r\nthose which are marine, the purpura, whelk, and all that class; but the\r\nstate of concealment is more conspicuous in those which do not adhere\r\nto rocks; for these also conceal themselves, as the pectens. Some have\r\nan operculum on their exterior, as the land snails; and the alteration\r\nof those that are not free is inconspicuous. They do not all conceal\r\nthemselves at the same period; for the snails are torpid during the\r\nwinter, the purpura and whelk for thirty days under the dog star, and\r\nthe pectens at the same period. Most of them conceal themselves in very\r\ncold and very hot weather.\r\n\r\n2. Almost all insects become torpid, except those which dwell in the\r\nhabitations of men, and those that perish and do not survive for a\r\nyear. They are torpid in the winter. Some conceal themselves for a\r\ngood while, others only in the coldest days, as the bees, for these\r\nalso conceal themselves. This is shown by their not touching the food\r\nwhich is prepared for them; and if any of them creep out, they appear\r\ntransparent, and plainly have nothing in their stomach. They remain at\r\nrest from the setting of the Pleiades until the spring. Animals pass\r\ntheir torpid state in warm places, and in the spots they are accustomed\r\nto inhabit.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n1. Many sanguineous animals become torpid, as those which are furnished\r\nwith scales, the serpent, lizard, gecko, and the river crocodile,\r\nduring the four winter months in which they eat nothing. Other serpents\r\nconceal themselves in the earth, but the viper lies hidden among\r\nstones. Many fish also become torpid, especially the hippurus and\r\ncoracinus during the winter; for these alone are never taken but at\r\ncertain seasons, which never vary. Almost all the rest are taken at all\r\nseasons. The lamprey, orphus, and conger conceal themselves. The rock\r\nfish conceal themselves in pairs, as the cichla, cottyphus, and perca,\r\nthe male with the female, in which way also they prepare for their\r\nyoung.\r\n\r\n2. The tunny conceals itself during winter in deep places, and they\r\nbecome fattest at this season. The season of capturing them commences\r\nwith the rising of Pleiades, and continues to the end of the setting of\r\nArcturus. All the rest of their time they remain quiet in concealment.\r\nA few of these are taken during the period of their concealment, and\r\nso are some other hybernating creatures, if they are disturbed by the\r\nwarmth of their abode or the unusual mildness of the season. For they\r\ncome out a little from their holes to feed, and also when the moon is\r\nfull. Most fish are better tasted during the period of concealment. The\r\nprimades bury themselves in the mud. This is shown by their not being\r\ntaken, or their seeming to have a great deal of mud on their backs and\r\ntheir fins pressed down.\r\n\r\n3. In spring, however, they begin to move and come to the shore to\r\ncopulate and deposit their ova. At this season they are captured full\r\nof ova, and then also they appear to be in season, but are not so good\r\nin autumn and winter. At the same season also the males appear to be\r\nfull of melt. When their ova are small they are taken with difficulty;\r\nbut as they grow larger many are taken when they are infested by the\r\nœstrus. Some fish bury themselves in sand, others in mud, with only\r\ntheir mouths above the surface. Fishes usually conceal themselves\r\nonly in the winter. The malacostraca, the rock fishes, the batus,\r\nand selache only in the most severe weather. This is shown by the\r\ndifficulty of capturing them in cold weather.\r\n\r\n4. Some fish, as the glaucus, conceal themselves in summer time; for\r\nthis fish hides itself for sixty days in the summer time. The onus and\r\nthe chrysophrys hide themselves. The reason for supposing that the onus\r\nhides itself for a long while appears to be that it is captured at long\r\nintervals; and the influence of the stars upon them; and especially of\r\nthe dog-star, appears to be the cause of their hiding themselves in\r\nsummer time, for the sea is then disturbed. This is most conspicuous in\r\nthe Bosphorus; for the mud is thrown up, and the fish are thus brought\r\nto the surface; and they say that, when the bottom is disturbed, more\r\nfish are often taken in the same cast the second than the first time;\r\nand after much rain animals make their appearance which before were\r\neither not seen at all or but seldom.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n1. Many kinds of birds also conceal themselves, and they do not all,\r\nas some suppose, migrate to warmer climates; but those which are near\r\nthe places of which they are permanent inhabitants, as the kite and\r\nswallow, migrate thither; but those that are farther off from such\r\nplaces do not migrate, but conceal themselves; and many swallows have\r\nbeen seen in hollow places almost stripped of feathers; and kites,\r\nwhen they first showed themselves, have come from similar situations.\r\nBirds with crooked claws, and those also with straight claws, conceal\r\nthemselves indiscriminately; for the stork, blackbird,[217] turtle\r\ndove, and lark hide themselves, and by general agreement the turtle\r\ndove most of all, for no one is ever said to have seen one during the\r\nwinter. At the commencement of hybernation it is very fat, and during\r\nthat season it loses its feathers, though they remain thick for a long\r\nwhile. Some of the doves conceal themselves; others do not, but migrate\r\nalong with the swallows. The thrush and the starling also conceal\r\nthemselves, and among birds with crooked claws the kite and the owl are\r\nnot seen for a few days.\r\n\r\n[217] Κόττυφος, Turdus merula, _Strack_, blackbird, but probably more\r\nthan one kind of bird is included under the same name. Compare 9, 36, 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n1. Among viviparous quadrupeds the porcupines and bears hybernate. It\r\nis evident that the wild bears conceal themselves; but there is some\r\ndoubt whether it is on account of the cold or from any other cause,\r\nfor at this season both the males and females are so fat that they\r\ncannot move easily. The female also produces her young at this season,\r\nand hides herself until the cubs are of an age to be led forth. This\r\nshe does in the spring, about three months after the solstice, and she\r\ncontinues invisible for at least forty days. During fourteen days of\r\nthis period they say that she does not move at all. For more than this\r\nperiod afterwards she remains invisible, but moves about and is awake.\r\nA pregnant bear has either never or very rarely been captured; and it\r\nis quite plain that they eat nothing during the whole of this period;\r\nfor they never come out; and if they are captured, their stomach and\r\nentrails appear to be empty; and it is said that, because nothing\r\nis presented to it, the intestine sometimes adheres to itself; and,\r\ntherefore, at their first emergence, they eat the arum, in order to\r\nopen the entrail and make a passage through it.\r\n\r\n2. The dormouse hybernates in trees and is then very fat, and the\r\nwhite Pontic mouse. (Some hybernating animals cast their old age, as\r\nit is called. This is the outer skin and the coverings at the period\r\nof birth.) It has already been observed, that among viviparous animals\r\nwith feet there is some doubt as to the cause of the hybernation of\r\nbears; but almost all animals with scales hybernate and cast their old\r\nage; that is, all that have a soft skin and no shell, as the tortoise;\r\nfor both the tortoise and the emys belong to the class of animals with\r\nscales; but all such as the gecko, lizard, and especially the serpents,\r\ncast their skins; for they do this both in the spring, when they first\r\nemerge, and again in the autumn.\r\n\r\n3. The viper also casts its skin both in the spring and autumn, and is\r\nnot, as some persons say, the only serpent that does not cast its skin.\r\nWhen serpents begin to cast their skin, it is first of all separated\r\nfrom their eyes; and to those who do not know what is about to happen\r\nthey appear to be blind. After this it is separated from the head, for\r\nfirst of all it appears entirely white. In a night and day the whole\r\nof the old skin is separated from the commencement at the head to the\r\ntail; and when cast it is turned inside out, for the serpent emerges as\r\nthe infant does from the chorion.\r\n\r\n4. Insects which cast their skins do it in the same way as the silpha,\r\nempis, and the coleoptera, as the beetle. All creatures cast it after\r\nbirth; for in viviparous animals the chorion is separated, and in\r\nthe vermiparous, as bees and locusts, they emerge from a case. The\r\ngrasshoppers, when they cast their skins, sit upon olives and reeds.\r\nWhen the case is ruptured, they emerge, and leave a little fluid behind\r\nthem, and after a short time they fly away and sing.\r\n\r\n5. Among marine creatures the carabi and astaci cast their skins either\r\nin spring or autumn, after having deposited their ova; and carabi\r\nhave been sometimes taken with a soft thorax, because their shell was\r\nruptured, while the lower part, which was not ruptured, was hard. For\r\nthe process is not the same in them as in serpents. The carabi remain\r\nin concealment for about five months. The crabs also cast their old\r\nskin, certainly those which have soft shells; and they say that those\r\nwhich have hard shells do the same, as the maia and graus. When they\r\nhave cast their shells, the new shells are first of all soft, and the\r\ncrabs are unable to walk. They do not cast their skins once only,\r\nbut frequently. I have now described when and how animals conceal\r\nthemselves, and what creatures cast their skin, and when they do so.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n1. Animals are not all in good health at the same season, nor in the\r\nsame degrees of heat and cold. Their health and diseases are different\r\nat different seasons in various classes, and on the whole are not alike\r\nin all. Dry weather agrees with birds, both in respect of their general\r\nhealth and the rearing of their young, and especially with pigeons; and\r\nwet weather, with few exceptions, agrees with fish. On the contrary,\r\nshowery weather generally disagrees with birds, and dry weather with\r\nfish; for, on the whole, abundance of drink does not agree with birds.\r\n\r\n2. For the birds with crooked claws, generally speaking, as it was\r\nbefore remarked, do not drink. But Hesiod was ignorant of this\r\ncircumstance; for in relating the siege of Nineveh he represents the\r\npresiding eagle of the augury drinking. Other birds drink, but not\r\nmuch; neither do any other oviparous animals with spongy lungs. The\r\nsickness of birds is manifest in their plumage; for it is uneven, and\r\nhas not the same smoothness as when they are well.\r\n\r\n3. The generality of fish, as it was observed, thrive the most in rainy\r\nyears; for not only in such seasons do they obtain a greater supply of\r\nfood, but the wet weather agrees with them as with the plants that grow\r\non land; for potherbs, even if watered, do not grow so well as in wet\r\nweather. The same is the case with the reeds that grow in ponds; for\r\nthey never grow, as we may say, except in rainy weather.\r\n\r\n4. And this is the reason why so many fish migrate every summer into\r\nthe Pontus; for the number of rivers which flow into it render the\r\nwater fresh, and also bring down a supply of food, and many fish also\r\nascend the rivers, and flourish in the rivers and lakes, as the amia\r\nand mullet. The cobii also become fat in the rivers; and on the whole,\r\nthose places which have the largest lakes furnish the most excellent\r\nfish.\r\n\r\n5. Of all kinds of water, summer showers agree best with fish; and if\r\nthe spring, summer, and autumn have been wet, a fine winter. And to\r\nspeak generally, if the season is healthy for mankind, it will be the\r\nsame for fish. They do not thrive in cold places. Those which have\r\na stone in their head, as the chromis, labrax, sciœna, and phagrus,\r\nsuffer most in the winter; for the refrigeration of the stone causes\r\nthem to freeze and be driven on shore.\r\n\r\n6. Abundant rain confers health on most fish; but the contrary is the\r\ncase with the mullet and cephalus, which some call marinus; for if\r\nthere is a great supply of rain water, they soon become blind. The\r\ncephali are particularly liable to this disease in the winter; for\r\ntheir eyes become white. When captured they are lean, and at last\r\nperish altogether. They do not, however, appear to suffer so much from\r\nthe wet as from the cold; for in other places, and especially in the\r\nswamps in the neighbourhood of the Argive Nauplia, many are found blind\r\nin severe weather, and many also are taken with white eyes.\r\n\r\n7. The chrysophrys also suffers from the cold; the arachnas from the\r\nheat, which makes it lean. Dry seasons agree better with the coracinus\r\nthan with any other fish, and for this reason, because it is generally\r\nwarm in dry weather. Particular localities are favourable to different\r\nspecies, as either the neighbourhood of the land, or the deep waters to\r\nthose which only frequent one of these localities, or particular places\r\nto those which frequent both. There are especial places in which each\r\nof them thrive; but, generally speaking, they prefer places full of sea\r\nweed; for those which inhabit places with plenty of food are generally\r\nfound to be fatter; for those that eat fuci obtain plenty of food,\r\nwhile those that are carnivorous find an abundant supply of fish.\r\n\r\n8. They are also affected by northern and southern aspects, for the\r\nlong fish thrive best in northern situations, and in northern places\r\nin the summer time more long fish than flat fish are taken in the same\r\nlocality. The tunny and xiphia suffer from the œstrus, at the rising\r\nof the dog-star, for both these fish at this season have beneath their\r\nfins a little worm which is called œstrus, which resembles a scorpion,\r\nand is about the size of a spider; they suffer so much from this\r\ntorment that the xiphias leaps out of the sea as high as the dolphin,\r\nand in this manner frequently falls upon ships.\r\n\r\n9. The tunny delights in warm weather more than any other fish, and\r\nthey resort to the sand near the sea-shore for the sake of the warmth,\r\nand there they float on the surface; the small fish are safe because\r\nthey are overlooked, for large fish pursue those of a moderate size.\r\nThe greater portion of the ova and melt are destroyed ... by the heat,\r\nfor whatever they touch they entirely destroy.\r\n\r\n10. The greatest number of fish are taken before sunrise and after\r\nsunset, or just about sunrise and sunset, for the casts made at this\r\nperiod are called seasonable. For this reason the fishermen take up\r\ntheir nets at this time, for the sight of the fish is then most readily\r\ndeceived. During the night they remain quiet, and at mid-day, when the\r\nlight is strong, they see very well.\r\n\r\n11. Fish do not appear to be subject to any of those pestilential\r\ndiseases which so often occur among men and quadrupeds, as the horse\r\nand ox, and other animals, both domestic and wild. They appear,\r\nhowever, to suffer from ill health, and the fishermen consider that\r\nthis is proved by the capture of some lean, and apparently weak\r\nindividuals, and others that have lost their colour, among a number of\r\nfat ones of the same kind. This is the nature of sea-fish.\r\n\r\n12. No pestilential disease attacks river and pond fish, though some of\r\nthem are subject to peculiar diseases, as the glanis, from its swimming\r\nnear the surface, appears to be star-struck by the dog-star, and it is\r\nstupefied by loud thunder. The carp suffers in the same way, but not\r\nso severely. The glanis, in shallow water, is often destroyed by the\r\ndragon-serpent. In the ballerus and tilon a worm is produced, under\r\nthe influence of the dog-star, which makes them rise to the surface\r\nand become weak, and when they come to the surface they are killed by\r\nthe heat; a violent disease attacks the chalcis, which is destroyed by\r\na number of lice, which are produced under its gills; no other fish\r\nappear to be subject to such a disease.\r\n\r\n13. Fishes are poisoned with the plant called mullein, for which reason\r\nsome persons capture them by poisoning the waters of rivers and ponds;\r\nand the Phœnicians poison the sea in the same way. There are two other\r\nplans which are adopted for the capture of fish; for since fish avoid\r\nthe deep parts of rivers in cold weather (for even otherwise the river\r\nwater is cold), they dig a ditch through the land to the river, which\r\nthey cover over with grass and stones so as to resemble a cave, with\r\none opening from the river, and when the frost comes on they capture\r\nthe fish with a basket. The other mode of fishing is practised both in\r\nsummer and winter. In the middle of the stream they raise a structure\r\nwith faggots and stones, leaving one part open for a mouth; in this a\r\nbasket is placed, with which they catch the fish, as they take away the\r\nstones.\r\n\r\n14. Rainy years agree with all the testacea except the purpura; this is\r\na proof of it, if placed near the mouth of a river, they take the fresh\r\nwater, and die the same day. The purpura will live about fifty days\r\nafter it has been taken. They are nourished by each other, for a plant\r\nlike a fucus or moss grows upon their shells. They say that whatever\r\nis cast to them for food is done for the sake of weight, that they may\r\nweigh the more.\r\n\r\n15. Dry weather is injurious to other testacea, for it renders them\r\nfewer in quantity and inferior in quality, and the pectens become more\r\nred. In the Pyrrhæan Euripus the pectens perish, not only from the\r\ninstrument with which the fishermen scrape them together, but also from\r\ndry weather. The other testacea thrive in wet weather, because it makes\r\nthe sea-water fresher. The cold of the Pontus and of the rivers that\r\nflow into it renders bivalve shells rare. The univalves, however, are\r\nfrozen in cold weather. This is the nature of aquatic animals.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n1. Among quadrupeds, swine suffer from three diseases, one of these\r\nis called sore throat, in which the parts above the jaws and the\r\nbranchia become inflamed; it may also occur in other parts of the\r\nbody, and frequently seizes upon the foot, and sometimes the ear. The\r\nneighbouring parts then become putrid, until it reaches the lungs,\r\nwhen the animal dies; the disease spreads rapidly, and the animal eats\r\nnothing from the period of the commencement of the disease, be it where\r\nit will. The swineherds have no other remedy but the excision of the\r\npart before the disease has spread far.\r\n\r\n2. There are two other diseases which are both called craura. One of\r\nthem consists in a pain and weight in the head, with which many of them\r\nare afflicted; the other is an excessive alvine discharge. This appears\r\nto be incurable. They relieve the former by the application of wine to\r\nthe nostrils, and washing them with wine. Recovery from this disease is\r\ndifficult, for it generally carries them off on the third or fourth day.\r\n\r\n3. They suffer particularly from sore throat, when the summer bears\r\nabundantly, and they are fat. The fruit of the mulberry is good for\r\nthem, and abundant washings with warm water, and scarification beneath\r\nthe tongue. If the flesh of swine is soft, it is full of small lumps\r\n(chalazæ) about the legs, neck, and shoulders; for in these parts the\r\nchalazæ are most frequent. If there are but a few, the flesh is sweet;\r\nif many, it becomes very fluid and soft.\r\n\r\n4. Those which have these chalazæ are easily distinguished; for they\r\nexist in the greatest numbers under the tongue, and if the hair is\r\nplucked from their mane it appears bloody underneath. Those which\r\nhave chalazæ cannot keep their hind legs still. They are not thus\r\naffected as long as they suck. The grain called tipha, which also forms\r\nexcellent food, is the remedy for the chalazæ. Vetches and figs are\r\nuseful both for fattening and rearing pigs; and on the whole their\r\nfood should not be all of one sort, but varied; for swine, like other\r\nanimals, derive advantage from a change in their food; and they say\r\nthat at the same time their food ought to inflate them, and to cover\r\nthem both with flesh and fat. Acorns are good for their food, but\r\nmake their flesh watery; and if they eat too many while pregnant, they\r\nproduce abortions, as sheep also do; for these animals evidently suffer\r\nthis from eating acorns. The swine is the only creature that we know of\r\nwhich has chalazæ in its flesh.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n1. Dogs suffer from these diseases which have received these names,\r\nlytta, cynanche, podagra. The lytta produces madness, and they\r\ninfect every creature which they bite, except mankind, with the same\r\ndisease. This disease is fatal to dogs and to any other animal they\r\nmay bite except man. The cynanche also is fatal to dogs; and there\r\nare comparatively few which recover from the podagra. Camels also are\r\nseized with lytta. (The elephant does not appear to suffer from any\r\nother infirmity except flatulency.)\r\n\r\n2. Gregarious oxen suffer from two diseases, one called podagra, the\r\nother craurus. The podagra affects their feet; but it is not fatal, nor\r\ndo they lose their hoofs. They derive benefit from their horns being\r\nsmeared with warm pitch. When attacked with craurus, their breathing\r\nbecomes warm and thick. Fever in mankind is the same as craurus in\r\ncattle. It is a sign of this disease, when they hang down their ears\r\nand will not eat. It soon proves fatal, and when dissected, their lungs\r\nappear putrid.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n1. Horses when grazing are free from all diseases except podagra; from\r\nthis they suffer, and sometimes lose their hoofs, which grow again as\r\nsoon as they are lost, and the loss of the hoof usually takes place as\r\nsoon as the first recommences its growth. It is a sign of the disease\r\nwhen the right testicle throbs, or when a wrinkled hollow place appears\r\na little below the middle of the nose. Horses that are brought up in a\r\ndomestic state suffer from several other diseases; they are attacked\r\nwith a disorder in their bowels, and it is a sign of the disease when\r\nthey drag their hind legs up to their fore legs, and keep them under\r\nin such a way that they almost strike together: if they go mad after\r\nhaving abstained from food for several days, they are relieved by\r\nbleeding and castration.[218]\r\n\r\n[218] The passage is altogether corrupt.\r\n\r\n2. The tetanus is another disease of horses, which is thus recognised;\r\nall the veins, and the head and neck are extended, and their legs\r\nare stiff when they walk; the horses also become full of corrupt\r\nmatter. They are also attacked by another disease in which they\r\nare said to have the crithia;[219] the softness of the roof of the\r\nmouth, and heated breath, are the signs of this disease, which is\r\nincurable, unless it stays of its own accord. Another disease is called\r\nnymphia,[220] which is relieved by the sound of a flute; it causes them\r\nto hang down their heads, and when anyone mounts they rush forward\r\nuntil they run against something. The horse is always dejected if\r\nafflicted with madness; this is a sign of it, if it lays down its ears\r\nupon its mane, and then draws them forward, and pants and breathes hard.\r\n\r\n[219] Indigestion caused by eating barley when heated.\r\n\r\n[220] Phrensy.\r\n\r\n3. These also are incurable if the heart is affected. It is a sign\r\nof this disease if the animal suffers from relaxation. And if the\r\nbladder alters its position, difficulty in making water is a sign\r\nof this disease; it draws up the hoofs and loins. It is also fatal\r\nfor the horse to swallow the staphilinus, which is of the same size\r\nas the spondyla. The bite of the shrew mouse is injurious to other\r\nanimals also; it causes sores, which are more severe if the creature\r\nis pregnant when it bites, for the sores then break. If they are not\r\npregnant, the animal does not perish. The creature called chalkis by\r\nsome persons and zygnis by others, inflicts either a fatal or very\r\npainful bite. It resembles a small lizard, and is of the same colour as\r\nthe serpent called the blind worm.\r\n\r\n4. And, on the whole, those who understand horses say that both these\r\nanimals and sheep suffer from all the infirmities with which mankind is\r\nafflicted. The horse, and every other beast of burden, is destroyed by\r\nthe poison of sandarach.[221] It is dissolved in water and strained.\r\nThe pregnant mare casts her young with the smell of a lamp going out.\r\nThis also happens to some pregnant women. This is the nature of the\r\ndiseases of horses.\r\n\r\n[221] Red sulphuret of arsenic.\r\n\r\n5. The hippomanes, as it is called, is said to be produced upon the\r\nfoals; the mares when they have bitten it off lick the foal and\r\ncleanse it. The fables on this subject have been invented by women and\r\ncharmers. It is, however, agreed that mares before parturition eject\r\nthe substance called polion.\r\n\r\n6. Horses recognise again the voices of any with which they may have\r\nfought. They delight in meadows and marshes, and drink dirty water; and\r\nif it is clean, they first disturb it with their hoof, and then drink\r\nand wash themselves. And on the whole, the horse is an animal fond of\r\nwater, and still more fond of moisture; wherefore, also, the nature of\r\nthe river-horse is thus constituted. In this respect the ox is very\r\ndifferent from the horse, for it will not drink unless the water is\r\nclean, cold, and unmixed.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\n1. Asses only suffer from one disease, which is called melis, which\r\nfirst attacks the head of the animal, and causes a thick and bloody\r\nphlegm to flow from the nostrils. If the disease extends to the lungs,\r\nit is fatal; but that which first attacks the head is not so. This\r\nanimal cannot bear cold, for which reason there are no asses in the\r\nvicinity of the Pontus and in Scythia.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\n1. Elephants suffer from flatulent diseases, for which reason they can\r\nneither evacuate their fluid or solid excrements. If they eat earth\r\nthey become weak, unless used to such food. If it is accustomed to\r\nit, it does no harm. Sometimes the elephant swallows stones. It also\r\nsuffers from diarrhœa. When attacked with this complaint, they are\r\ncured by giving them warm water to drink, and hay dipped in honey to\r\neat; and either of these remedies will stop the disease. When fatigued\r\nfor want of sleep, they are cured by being rubbed on the shoulders\r\nwith salt and oil, and warm water. When they suffer from pain in the\r\nshoulders, they are relieved by the application of roasted swine's\r\nflesh. Some elephants will drink oil, and some will not; and if any\r\niron weapon is struck into their body, the oil which they drink assists\r\nin its expulsion; and to those which will not drink it, they give wine\r\nof rice cooked with oil. This, then, is the nature of quadrupeds.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\n1. Insects generally thrive when the year is of the same kind as\r\nthe season in which they were born, such as the spring, moist and\r\nwarm. Certain creatures are produced in beehives, which destroy the\r\ncombs, and a little spinning worm, which destroys the wax. It is\r\ncalled clerus, or by some persons pyraustes. This creature produces\r\na spider-like animal like itself, which causes sickness in the hive,\r\nand another creature like the moth, which flies round the candle. This\r\nproduces a creature filled with a woolly substance. It is not killed by\r\nthe bees, and is only driven out by smoking it. A kind of caterpillar\r\nalso, which is called teredo, is produced in the hives. The bees do not\r\ndrive it away. They suffer most from diseases when the woods produce\r\nflowers infected with rust, and in dry seasons. All insects die when\r\nplunged in oil, and most rapidly if their head is oiled, and they are\r\nplaced in the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\n1. Animals also differ in their localities: for some are entirely\r\nabsent from some localities which exist in others, though small and\r\nshortlived, and not thriving. And frequently there will be a great\r\ndifference even in adjoining places, as the grasshopper is found in\r\nsome parts of Milesia, and is absent from those in the immediate\r\nvicinity. And in Cephalenia a river divides the country, on one side of\r\nwhich the grasshopper is found, and not on the other.\r\n\r\n2. In Poroselene a road divides the country, on one side of which the\r\nweasel is found, and not on the other. In Bœotia there are many moles\r\nin the neighbourhood of Orchomenus, but in the adjoining Lebadian\r\ndistrict there are none, nor if they are imported, are they willing\r\nto burrow. If hares are taken into Ithaca they will not live, but are\r\nseen dead on the sea coast, turned in the direction in which they were\r\nbrought. In Sicily the hippomyrmex is not found, and in Cyrene there\r\nwere formerly no croaking frogs.\r\n\r\n3. In all Libya there is neither wild boar, nor stag, nor wild goat.\r\nAnd in India, Ctesias, who is not worthy of credit, says, there are\r\nneither domestic nor wild swine; but the exsanguineous and burrowing\r\ntribes are all large. In the Pontus there are no malacia, nor all the\r\nkinds of testacea, except in a few places; but in the Red Sea all the\r\ntestacea are of a great size. In Syria there are sheep with tails a\r\ncubit in width, and the ears of the goats are a span and four fingers,\r\nand some of them bring their ears down to the ground: and the oxen,\r\nlike the camels, have a mane upon the point of the shoulder. In Lycia\r\nthe goats are shorn as the sheep are in other places.\r\n\r\n4. In Libya the horned rams are born at once with horns, and not the\r\nmales only, as Homer says, but all the rest also. In the part of\r\nScythia near the Pontus, the contrary is the case, for they are born\r\nwithout horns. And in Egypt some of the cattle, as the oxen and sheep,\r\nare larger than in Greece, and others are smaller, as the dogs, wolves,\r\nhares, foxes, ravens, and hawks. Others are nearly of the same size,\r\nas the crows and goats. This difference originates in the food which\r\nis abundant for some, and scarce for others. For the wolves, hawks,\r\nand carnivorous creatures food is scarce, for there are but few small\r\nbirds. For the dasypus and others which are not carnivorous, neither\r\nthe hard nor soft fruits are of any long continuance.\r\n\r\n5. The temperature is also very influential; for in Illyria, Thrace,\r\nand Epirus, the asses are small. In Scythia, and Celtic countries,\r\nthey do not occur at all, for in these places the winter is severe. In\r\nArabia the lizards are more than a cubit long, and the mice are much\r\nlarger than those which inhabit our fields, their fore legs being a\r\nspan long, and their hind legs as long as from the first joint of the\r\nfinger....\r\n\r\n6. In Libya, the serpents, as it has been already remarked, are very\r\nlarge. For some persons say that as they sailed along the coast, they\r\nsaw the bones of many oxen, and that it was evident to them that they\r\nhad been devoured by the serpents. And as the ships passed on, the\r\nserpents attacked the triremes, and some of them threw themselves upon\r\none of the triremes and overturned it. There are more lions in Europe,\r\nand especially in the country between the Achelous and the Nessus. In\r\nAsia there are leopards which are not found in Europe.\r\n\r\n7. On the whole, the wild animals of Asia are the fiercest, those of\r\nEurope the boldest, and those of Libya the most varied in form; and it\r\nhas passed into a proverb that Libya is always producing something new.\r\nFor the want of water brings many heterogeneous animals together at\r\nthe drinking places, where they copulate and produce young, if their\r\nperiods of gestation happen to be the same, and their size not very\r\ndifferent. The desire of drinking makes them gentle to each other, for\r\nthey differ from the animals of other countries, in wanting to drink\r\nmore in winter than in summer; for on account of the great want of\r\nwater during the summer they are habituated to do without water; and if\r\nthe mice drink they die.\r\n\r\n8. Other animals are produced by the intercourse of heterogeneous\r\ncreatures, as in Cyrene the wolves copulate with the dogs, and produce\r\nyoung; and the Laconian dogs are bred between a dog and a fox. They\r\nsay that the Indian dogs are derived from the tiger and the dog; not\r\ndirectly, but from the third mixture of the breeds; for they say that\r\nthe first race was very fierce. They take the dogs and tie them up in\r\nthe desert. Many of them are devoured, if the wild animal does not\r\nhappen to desire sexual intercourse.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\n1. Different localities produce a variety of dispositions, as\r\nmountainous and rough places, or smooth plains. They are more fierce\r\nand robust in appearance in mountains, as the swine of Athos; for the\r\nmales of those which inhabit the plains cannot endure even the females\r\nof the other kind: and different situations have great influence on the\r\nbite of wild animals. All the scorpions about Pharus and other places\r\nare not painful, but in Caria and other localities they are frequent,\r\nand large, and fierce, and their sting is fatal to either man or beast,\r\neven to sows, which are but little influenced by the bite of other\r\ncreatures, and black sows are more easily affected than others. The\r\nswine die very soon after being stung, if they come near the water.\r\n\r\n2. The bite also of serpents varies much; for in Libya the asp is\r\nfound, from which they form a septic poison, which is incurable. In the\r\nplant silphium[222] is found a small serpent, for the bite of which\r\na remedy has been discovered in a small stone, which is taken out of\r\nthe tomb of one of the ancient kings: this they drink dipped in wine.\r\nIn some parts of Italy the bite of the gecko is found to be fatal. If\r\none poisonous animal eats another, as, if a viper eats a scorpion,\r\nits bite is the most fatal of all. The saliva of a man is hostile to\r\nmost of them. There is one small serpent, which some persons call\r\nhierus, which is avoided even by large serpents. It is a cubit long,\r\nand appears rough. Whatsoever it bites immediately becomes putrid in\r\na circle round the wound. There is also a small serpent in India, the\r\nonly one for which there is no remedy.\r\n\r\n[222] Probably assafœtida.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\n1. Animals also differ in being in good condition or not during\r\ngestation. The testacea, as the pectens and the malacostraca, as the\r\ncarabi and such like, are best when pregnant; for this word is also\r\nused of the testacea. For the malacostraca have been observed both in\r\nthe act of copulation and oviposition; but none of the testacea have\r\never been seen so occupied. The malacia, such as the teuthis, sepia,\r\nand polypus, are most excellent when pregnant; and almost all fish are\r\ngood during the early part of the period; but as the time advances some\r\nare good and some not so.\r\n\r\n2. The mænis thrives during gestation. The form of the female is round,\r\nthat of the male longer and broader. And when the period of gestation\r\ncommences in the females, the males become black and variegated, and\r\nare not fit to eat. Some persons call them tragi at this period. Those\r\nwhich are called cottyphus and cichla also change their colour; and the\r\ncaris also changes at this season and some birds, which are black in\r\nspring and afterwards become white.\r\n\r\n3. The phycis also changes its colour; for it is white at all other\r\nseasons, and variegated in the spring. This is the only sea fish that,\r\nas they say, makes a nest in which it deposits its ova. The mænis,\r\nas it was before observed, and the smaris also change their colours,\r\nand from being white in summer become black. This is particularly\r\nconspicuous about the fins and gills. The coracinus is best when\r\npregnant, and so is the mænis. The cestreus, labrax, and nearly all\r\ncreatures that swim are inferior at this season.\r\n\r\n4. There are a few which are good, whether pregnant or not, as the\r\nglaucus. Old fish also are inferior; and old tunnies are not even fit\r\nfor salting, for much of the flesh is dissolved. The same thing also\r\nhappens with other fish. The older fish are distinguished by the size\r\nand hardness of their scales; an old tunny has been taken which weighed\r\nfifteen talents, and the length of the tail was two cubits and a span.\r\n\r\n5. River and pond fish are most excellent, after depositing their ova\r\nand semen, and recovering their flesh. Some of them, however, are good\r\nwhile pregnant, as the saperdis; and others bad, as the glanis. In all\r\nthe male is better than the female; but the female glanis is better\r\nthan the male. Those which they call female eels are better than the\r\nmales. They call them females, though they are not so, but only differ\r\nin appearance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THE NINTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n1. The dispositions of obscure and short-lived animals are less easily\r\nobserved than those of long-lived animals; for they appear to have a\r\ncertain inclination towards each natural affection of the soul, such as\r\nprudence and folly, courage and cowardice, mildness and cruelty, and\r\nsuch other habits. Some also, which have the sense of hearing, appear\r\nto be capable of a certain degree of instruction and discipline, both\r\nfrom one another and from mankind, for they not only distinguish the\r\ndifference of sounds but also of signs.\r\n\r\n2. And in all animals in which there is a distinction of the sexes\r\nnature has given a similar disposition to the males and to the females.\r\nThis is most conspicuous in man, and the larger animals, and in\r\nviviparous quadrupeds; for the disposition of the female is softer, and\r\nmore tameable and submissive, and more ingenious; as the females of\r\nthe Lacedemonian dog are more gentle than the males. In the Molossian\r\nrace of dogs, those employed in hunting differ in no respect from other\r\ndogs; while those employed in following sheep are larger and more\r\nfierce in their attack on wild beasts. A mixture of the Molossian and\r\nLacedemonian races is both braver and more capable of enduring fatigue.\r\n\r\n3. The females of all animals are less violent in their passions than\r\nthe males, except the female bear and pardalis, for the female of these\r\nappears more courageous than the male. In other animals the females are\r\nmore soft and insidious, less simple, more petulant, and more active\r\nin the care of their young. The disposition of the males is opposed to\r\nthis; for they are more passionate and fierce, more straightforward,\r\nand less invidious. The vestiges of these dispositions exist, as we may\r\nsay, in all, but are more conspicuous in those which have the strongest\r\nmoral habits, and most of all in mankind; for the nature of the\r\nhuman subject is the most complete, so that these habits appear more\r\nconspicuous in mankind than in other animals.\r\n\r\n4. Wherefore women are more compassionate and more readily made to\r\nweep, more jealous and querulous, more fond of railing, and more\r\ncontentious. The female also is more subject to depression of spirits\r\nand despair than the male. She is also more shameless and false, more\r\nreadily deceived, and more mindful of injury, more watchful, more idle,\r\nand on the whole less excitable than the male. On the contrary, the\r\nmale is more ready to help, and, as it has been said, more brave than\r\nthe female; and even in the malacia, if the sepia is struck with a\r\ntrident, the male comes to help the female, but the female makes her\r\nescape if the male is struck.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n1. Animals often fight with each other, particularly those which\r\ninhabit the same places and eat the same food; for when food becomes\r\nscarce, congeners fight together. They say that seals which occupy the\r\nsame locality will fight, the males with the males and the females\r\nwith the females, until one party is either killed or ejected by the\r\nother, and their cubs also will fight in the same way. All animals also\r\nwill fight with carnivorous creatures, and these will fight with other\r\nanimals, for they feed upon living creatures; for which reason augurs\r\nobserve the disputes and agreements of animals, considering that their\r\ndisputes betoken war, and their agreements peace with each other.\r\n\r\n2. When supplied with plenty of food, animals that are naturally afraid\r\nof man and fierce appear to submit themselves to him, and to conduct\r\nthemselves quietly towards each other. The care which is taken of\r\nanimals in Egypt demonstrates this circumstance; for even the fiercest\r\ncreatures live together, when they have food enough, and are not in any\r\nwant; for they become tame from the supply of their wants which they\r\nreceive, as the crocodiles are tamed by the priests by the care which\r\nis bestowed on their food. The same thing may be observed in other\r\ncountries and in their different parts.\r\n\r\n3. The eagle and the dragon are enemies, for the eagle feeds on\r\nserpents. The ichneumon and the spider are also enemies, for the\r\nichneumon hunts the spider. Among birds the pœcilis and the lark and\r\nthe wood-pecker and chloreus are enemies, for they eat each others'\r\neggs. The crow and the owl also are enemies; for at mid-day the crow,\r\ntaking advantage of the dim sight of the owl, secretly seizes and\r\ndevours its eggs, and the owl eats those of the crow during the night;\r\nand one of these is master during the day, the other during the night.\r\nThe owl and orchilus are enemies; for the latter eats the eggs of the\r\nowl. During the day other birds fly round the owl, which is called\r\n\"astonishing it,\" and as they fly round it pluck off its feathers. For\r\nthis reason fowlers use it in hunting for all kinds of birds.\r\n\r\n4. The presbys contends with the weasel and crow, for they eat its eggs\r\nand young. The turtle and pyrallis are foes, for their food and mode of\r\nlife are the same. The celeus and libyus, kite and raven are enemies;\r\nfor the kite, from the superiority of its claws and flight, can take\r\nfrom the raven anything it may have caught, so that their food is the\r\ncause of their enmity also. Those that obtain their food from the sea\r\nalso are foes, as the brenthus, larus, and harpa. The triorches is a\r\nfoe to the toad and the serpent; for the triorches eats the others. The\r\nturtle and chloreus are foes, for the chloreus kills the turtle, and\r\nthe crow kills the bird called typanus. The little owl and all other\r\nbirds with crooked claws eat the calaris, from whence their enmity\r\narises.\r\n\r\n5. The gecko and the spider are enemies, for the gecko eats spiders.\r\nThe pipo is a foe to the heron, for it devours the eggs and young of\r\nthe heron. Enmity also exists between the ægithus and the ass; for\r\nthe ass frequents thorny places, that it may scratch its sores, and\r\nby this means, and when it brays it overturns the eggs and young of\r\nthe ægithus, for they fall out of the nest from fear of the noise,\r\nand the bird, to revenge this injury, flies upon the ass and inflicts\r\nwounds. The wolf is the enemy of the ass, bull, and fox; for being a\r\ncarnivorous animal, it attacks both oxen, asses, and foxes. The fox and\r\ncircus are enemies for the same reason; for the circus having crooked\r\nclaws, and being carnivorous, attacks and inflicts wounds with its\r\nclaws.\r\n\r\n6. The raven is an enemy to the bull and ass, for it flies round them\r\nand strikes their eyes. The eagle and the heron are foes, for the\r\neagle has crooked claws and attacks it, and the other dies in defending\r\nitself. The æsalon is a foe to the vulture, and the crex to the coleus,\r\nblackbird, and chlorion, which some persons fabulously say derives its\r\norigin from a funeral pile, for it destroys both themselves and their\r\nyoung. The sitta and trochilus are foes to the eagle, and the eagle, as\r\nwell for this reason, as because it is carnivorous, is a foe to them\r\nall.\r\n\r\n7. The anthus is the enemy of the horse, for it drives the horse from\r\nits pasture, for the anthus also feeds on grass; it is dim-sighted and\r\nnot quick; it imitates the voice of the horse, which it frightens by\r\nflying at it, and drives it from its pasture; if the horse can seize\r\nupon it, he will kill it. The anthus lives near rivers and marshes;\r\nit is of a fine colour, and lives well. The ass attacks the colota, a\r\ncreature which lives in the manger, and prevents it from eating, by\r\nmaking its way into its nostrils.\r\n\r\n8. There are three kinds of heron, the black, the white sort, and the\r\none called asterias; of these, the black rests and copulates with\r\ndifficulty, for it utters a cry, and, as they say, bleeds from the eyes\r\nduring coition, and the process of parturition is severe and painful;\r\nit attacks creatures which injure it, as the eagle, for it seizes upon\r\nit, and the fox, for this creature attacks it during the night, and the\r\nlark, which steals its eggs.\r\n\r\n9. The serpent is an enemy to the weasel and the hog, for if the weasel\r\nand serpent live in the same house they both require the same kind of\r\nfood; and swine eat serpents. The æsalon is a foe to the fox, for it\r\nstrikes and pecks it, and destroys its young, for it has crooked claws.\r\nThe raven and the fox are friendly, for the raven also attacks the\r\næsalon, and so they help each other in the attack. The little owl and\r\nthe æsalon are mutual foes, for both have crooked claws. The little owl\r\nand the swan attack the eagle, and the swan often comes off victorious.\r\nOf all birds the swans are most disposed to devour[223] each other.\r\n\r\n[223] To fight with each other.--See Liddell and Scott's Lexicon, s. v.\r\nἀλληλομάχος.\r\n\r\n10. Some animals are always ready to attack each other, and others, as\r\nmankind, only at particular times. The ass and the acanthis are foes,\r\nfor the latter feeds entirely on thorns, but the former only when they\r\nare tender. The anthus, acanthis, and ægithus are foes, and it is said\r\nthat the blood of the anthus and ægithus will not mix. The crow and\r\nheron are friends, and so are the schœnion, lark, laëdus, and celeus,\r\nfor the celeus lives by the side of rivers and thickets, but the laëdus\r\nlives among rocks and mountains, and is fond of the place in which\r\nit lives. The piphinx, harpa, and kite are friends; the fox and the\r\nserpent also, for both live in holes; and the blackbird and the turtle.\r\n\r\n11. The lion and jackal are foes, for both are carnivorous, and live\r\non the same substances. Elephants also fight fiercely with each other,\r\nand strike with their tusks; the conquered submits entirely, and cannot\r\nendure the voice of the victor: and elephants differ much in the\r\ncourage they exhibit. The Indians use both male and female elephants\r\nin war, though the females are smaller and far less courageous. The\r\nelephant can overthrow walls by striking them with its large tusks; it\r\nthrows down palm trees by striking them with its head, and afterwards\r\nputting its feet upon them, stretches them on the ground.\r\n\r\n12. Elephant-hunting is conducted in the following way: men mount\r\nupon some tame courageous animals; when they have seized upon the\r\nwild animals they command the others to beat them till they fail from\r\nfatigue. The elephant-driver then leaps upon its back and directs it\r\nwith a lance; very soon after this they become tame and obedient. When\r\nthe elephant-drivers mount upon them they all become obedient, but when\r\nthey have no driver, some are tame and others not so, and they bind the\r\nfore legs of those that are wild with chains, in order to keep them\r\nquiet. They hunt both full-grown animals and young ones. Such is the\r\nfriendship and enmity of these wild animals originating in the supply\r\nof food, and the mode of life.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n1. Some fish are gregarious and friendly together, others that are less\r\ngregarious are hostile. Some are gregarious while they are pregnant,\r\nothers during the season of parturition. On the whole, the following\r\nare gregarious: the tunny, mœnis, cobius, box, saurus, coracinus,\r\nsinodon, trigla, muræena, anthia, eleginus, atherinus, sarginus,\r\nbelona, (mecon,) teuthus, iulus, pelamis, scombrus, and colias. Some\r\nof these are both gregarious, and live in pairs, for all the others\r\npair together; and some are gregarious at particular seasons, as it\r\nhas been said, while they are pregnant, and others in the season of\r\ndepositing their ova.\r\n\r\n2. The labrax and cestreus, though most hostile, will at certain\r\nseasons congregate with each other, for not only do congeners\r\ncongregate together, but all those which feed upon the same kind of\r\nfood, where it is abundant. The cestreus and the conger often survive\r\nafter having been deprived of their tail up to the anus, for the\r\ncestreus is eaten by the labrax, and the conger by the muræna. The\r\nstronger are hostile to the weaker, for the strong fish eat the others.\r\nThis much concerning marine creatures.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n1. It has been already observed, that the dispositions of animals\r\nvary in cowardice, mildness, courage, gentleness, intelligence, and\r\nfolly. The disposition of sheep, as I have said before, is foolish, and\r\nwithout sense; they are the most cowardly of all animals, and steal\r\naway into desert places for no purpose, and in winter often escape\r\nfrom their fold. When overtaken by a snow-storm, they will not get\r\naway, unless the shepherd drives them, but will stay behind and perish,\r\nunless the shepherds carry off the males, when the rest will follow.\r\n\r\n2. If a person takes any of the goats by the beard (which is like\r\nhair), all the rest stand by as if infatuated, and look at it. Sheep\r\nwill sleep in colder places than goats, for sheep are more quiet, and\r\nare ready to submit themselves to mankind. Goats do not bear the cold\r\nso well as sheep. Shepherds teach sheep to come together when they make\r\na noise, and if any of them is left behind and does not join the flock\r\nwhen it thunders, it will cast its young, if pregnant; wherefore, when\r\na noise is made, they will collect together in their sheds according to\r\ntheir custom. (Bulls are destroyed by wild beasts, if they wander away\r\nfrom their herd.) Sheep and goats lie down to rest separately in their\r\nraces, and when the sun begins to descend, the shepherds say that the\r\ngoats do not lie down with their faces to each other, but they turn\r\ntheir backs upon each other.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n1. Cows pasture in herds, and in companies, and if one of them wanders\r\nto a distance, all the rest follow, so that the herdsmen, if they do\r\nnot find her, immediately examine all the herds. Mares in herds, if\r\none of them happens to die, will bring up her foal among them, and the\r\nwhole race of horses appears to have warm natural affections, of which\r\nthe following is a proof: the barren mares will take away the foals\r\nfrom their mothers, and treat them with affection, though they soon die\r\nfor want of milk.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n1. Of all wild quadrupeds, the deer appears to be one of the most\r\nprudent in producing its young by the wayside (where wild beasts do\r\nnot come, for fear of men); as soon as the young is born, the dam eats\r\nthe chorion, and runs to the plant called seselis, which she eats,\r\nand having so done, returns to her kid. She then leads her kid to the\r\nstation, to which it may learn to retreat in case of danger; this is\r\nusually a chasm in a rock with a single entrance, which they say that\r\nit stays and defends. When the male gets fat (which usually happens\r\nin the autumn) he does not show himself, but gets out of the way, for\r\nhis fat makes him an easy prey. He sheds his horns in difficult and\r\nscarcely accessible places, from whence arises the proverb, \"where the\r\nstag sheds its horns,\" for they are afraid of being seen, as if they\r\nhad lost their means of defence. It is said that the left horn never\r\nhas been seen, for he conceals it as if it had some medicinal power.\r\n\r\n2. When a year old they have no horns, but only a commencement, as it\r\nwere a sign of what is to be; this is short, and covered with thick\r\ndown. When two years old, they have straight horns, like sticks, for\r\nwhich reason they are called pattalia (from παττάλος, a stake). In the\r\nthird year their horns are divided. In the fourth year they become\r\nrough. In this manner they are regularly developed till they are six\r\nyears old. After this age their horns are always the same, so that\r\ntheir age cannot be distinguished by them. Old stags, however, are\r\nrecognised by two signs; some of them have no teeth at all, others\r\nonly a few; and they never have the defensive part of the horn, that\r\npart of the growing horn which bends forwards, with which they defend\r\nthemselves, this the old stags never possess, but all the increase of\r\ntheir horns is upwards.\r\n\r\n3. They cast their horns every year about the month of April. When\r\nthey cast their horns they hide themselves during the day, as it\r\nhas been already observed. They conceal themselves in thickets, to\r\nprotect themselves from the flies. During this period they feed (in\r\nthe thickets) during the night, until their horns are grown. They are\r\nproduced at first under the skin, and are covered with down. When\r\nthey grow they expose them to the sun, that the horn may be matured\r\nand hardened. When they cease to give them pain if rubbed against\r\ntrees, they leave such places, for they are confident in their means\r\nof defence. An Achaïnian stag[224] has been taken with a considerable\r\nquantity of green ivy growing on its horns as in green wood, for the\r\nhorns are tender when first produced.\r\n\r\n[224] A bracket, or two year old stag.\r\n\r\n4. When the stags are bitten by the phalangium or any such creature,\r\nthey collect together a number of crabs and eat them. It appears\r\nto be wholesome for mankind to drink the same substance, but it is\r\nnot pleasant. The females, as soon as their young are born, eat the\r\nchorium, and it is not possible to obtain it, for they seize upon it\r\nbefore it can fall to the ground; it appears to have some medicinal\r\nproperties. The females are captured by the sound of the pipe and by\r\nsinging, and they are charmed by singing. When two persons go out to\r\ncapture them, one shows himself, and either plays upon a pipe, or\r\nsings, and the other strikes behind, when the first gives him the\r\nsignal; when the ears of the deer are erect, it hears quickly, and\r\ncannot be deceived, as it may be if they hang down.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n1. When bears are in flight, they drive their cubs before them, or\r\ntake them up and carry them. When nearly overtaken, they climb up into\r\ntrees. When they first come from their hiding place they eat the arum,\r\nas it has been already observed, and gnaw the trees as if they were\r\ncutting teeth. Many other animals also prudently provide themselves\r\nwith remedies, for they say that the wild goats in Crete, when struck\r\nwith an arrow, seek out the dittany, for this plant assists in working\r\nthe arrow from their body.\r\n\r\n2. And dogs, when they are ill, provide themselves with an emetic from\r\na certain kind of grass. The panther, when it has eaten the poison\r\ncalled pardalianches,[225] seeks for human ordure, for this relieves\r\nit. This poison also will kill lions, the hunters, therefore, suspend\r\nordure in a vessel from the trees, in order that the animal may not\r\nwander far from them; for the panther jumps at it and attempts to seize\r\nit, and dies before it can reach it. They say that the panther is aware\r\nthat its peculiar scent is grateful to other wild animals, and that it\r\npreys upon them in concealment, and when deer approach near, it catches\r\nhinds.\r\n\r\n[225] Perhaps Aconite.\r\n\r\n3. The Egyptian ichneumons, when they see the serpent called the asp,\r\ndo not attack it until they have invited others to assist. They roll\r\nthemselves in mud as a protection against its blows and wounds; they\r\nfirst bathe in water and then roll themselves on the ground. When the\r\ncrocodile gapes, the trochilus flies into its mouth, to cleanse its\r\nteeth; in this process the trochilus procures food, and the other\r\nperceives it, and does not injure it; when the crocodile wishes the\r\ntrochilus to leave, it moves its neck that it may not bite the bird.\r\nWhen the tortoise has eaten a viper, it afterwards eats origanum; this\r\nhas been observed. A person who had often seen this done, and had\r\nobserved that when the tortoise had tasted the origanum it went back\r\nto the viper, gathered all the origanum, and when this was done, the\r\ntortoise died.\r\n\r\n4. The weasel eats the herb rue before it attacks a serpent, for\r\nthe smell of this herb is obnoxious to serpents. When the draco has\r\neaten much fruit, it sucks the juice of the bitter lettuce; it has\r\nbeen seen to do this. When dogs are troubled with worms, they eat\r\nthe green tops of corn. When the pelargus or any other bird has been\r\nwounded in flight, they feed upon marjoram, and many persons have\r\nseen the locust[226] settle upon the neck of serpents with which it\r\nwas contending. The weasel also appears prudent in the way in which\r\nit attacks birds, for it kills them in the same manner as wolves kill\r\nsheep; it will fight also with serpents, and especially with those that\r\nhunt mice; for the weasel pursues the same animals.\r\n\r\n[226] Spax lacerticida.--_Schneider._\r\n\r\n5. Observations have been frequently made on the instinct of the\r\nhedgehog, for when the north and south winds change, those that dwell\r\nin the earth alter the position of the entrance of their burrows; those\r\nwhich are kept in houses alter their position from wall to wall, so\r\nthat they say that in Byzantium there was a person who obtained the\r\ncharacter of predicting the change of the weather, from observations\r\nmade on the hedgehog. The ictis is about the size of a small Maltese\r\ndog; in the thickness of its hair, its appearance, its white belly, and\r\nthe cunning of its disposition, it resembles the weasel; it is easily\r\ntamed; it attacks hives of bees, for it is very fond of honey; it eats\r\nbirds like cats; its penis, as it has been already observed, is bony,\r\nand appears to be a remedy for stranguary in the human subject; it is\r\nadministered in shavings.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n1. Many animals in their mode of life appear to imitate mankind,\r\nand one may observe greater accuracy of intellect in small than in\r\nlarge animals; as the manufacture of its dwelling by the swallow is\r\nremarkable among birds; it has the same method of combining chaff with\r\nmud, for it mixes the mud with straw, and if mud is not to be found,\r\nit dips in the water and rolls itself in the dust; it uses straw in\r\nmaking its nest as men use it, for it places the largest at the bottom,\r\nand makes it commensurate with its own bulk; both the male and female\r\nlabour in support of the young. They feed each in turn, observing by\r\nsome agreement the one which was first fed that none may receive food\r\ntwice; at first they turn the dung out of the nest, but as the young\r\nbirds increase in size, they teach them to turn themselves, so as to\r\neject their excrement out of the nest.\r\n\r\n2. There are some observations which may be made on pigeons, for\r\nthey will not pair with many mates, nor do they forsake their first\r\ncompanion, unless they become widowed. The care and anxiety of the male\r\nat the time of parturition are remarkable, for if the pain causes the\r\nhen to feel languid when near the nest, he beats her and drives her in.\r\nWhen the young are hatched, the parent provides salt earth, which is\r\ninjected into the open mouth of the young birds, as a preparation for\r\nthe reception of food. When it is time for them to leave the nest, the\r\nmale copulates with them all.\r\n\r\n3. In this manner they have usually a great affection for each other.\r\nSome females will copulate with males that are not their own mates.\r\nThis bird is contentious, they fight together, and attack each other's\r\nnests, though not frequently, for although they are beaten when at a\r\ndistance, they will fight to the last when near their nests; it appears\r\nto be characteristic of the pigeon, phaps, and turtle not to lean back\r\nwhen they drink, unless they have had sufficient. The turtle and phatta\r\nalways remain faithful to the same male, and will not permit another to\r\napproach them, and the male and female share the labour of incubation.\r\nThe male and female are not easily distinguished, except by their\r\ninternal structure.\r\n\r\n4. The phatta is long-lived, they have been known to live for\r\ntwenty-five or thirty years, some even forty years; their claws grow\r\nwhen they become aged, and pigeon breeders cut them off, and in no\r\nother respect are they inferior when aged. The turtle and the pigeon,\r\nif they have been blinded by those who use them as decoy birds, will\r\nlive eight years. The partridge lives fifteen years, the phaps and the\r\nturtle always build in the same places.\r\n\r\n5. On the whole, males also live longer than females, but in these\r\nbirds they say that the males die before the females; this conclusion\r\nis derived from the observation of those which are brought up in houses\r\nfor decoy birds. Some persons say that cock-sparrows only live for one\r\nyear, considering this as a proof, that early in the spring there are\r\nno birds with black beneath the chin; but they have it afterwards,\r\nas if none of the former birds had survived. The hen-sparrows have a\r\nlonger life, for these are taken among the young birds, and are easily\r\nknown by the hard portion about their bills. The turtle lives during\r\nthe summer in cold places, and during the winter in warm places. The\r\nfinch lives during the summer in warm places, and in cold places during\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n1. The heavy birds do not make nests, for it does not agree with their\r\nmode of flight, as the quail, partridge, and all such birds; but when\r\nthey have made a hole in the smooth ground (for they never produce\r\ntheir young in any other place), they collect together some thorns and\r\nsticks for a defence against the hawks and eagles, and there lay their\r\neggs and incubate. As soon as the young are hatched, they lead them\r\nout, because their slow flight prevents them from procuring food for\r\nthem. The quail and partridge shelter their young under their wings,\r\nlike the domestic fowl.\r\n\r\n2. They do not lay and incubate in the same place, lest any one should\r\ndiscover the place while they sat there for a long while; and when any\r\none in hunting falls upon the nest, the partridge halts before him, as\r\nif she could be taken, and draws him after her in the hopes of capture,\r\nuntil all the young ones have had time to escape, and after she flies\r\nback and recalls them to their nest. The partridge does not lay less\r\nthan ten eggs, and often sixteen. As it has been already observed,\r\nit is a bird of an evil and cunning disposition. In the spring they\r\nseparate with singing and fighting into pairs with the females which\r\neach may happen to take. The partridge being a bird of violent\r\npassions, it tries to prevent the female from incubation by rolling\r\nand breaking the eggs, if it can find them. The female, opposing this\r\nartifice by another, lays her eggs as she runs, and often, from her\r\ndesire of laying, she drops her eggs wherever she may be, if the male\r\nis present; and, that they may all be preserved, she does not return to\r\nthem. If she is observed by men, she leads them away from her eggs as\r\nfrom her young ones, and shows herself just before them until they are\r\ndrawn away from the nest.\r\n\r\n3. When the hen has escaped for incubation, the cocks crow and fight\r\ntogether. These are called widowers. The vanquished in the combat\r\nfollows his conqueror who alone has intercourse with him; and if any\r\none is overcome by a second, or by any chance one, the victor has\r\nsecret intercourse with him. This does not take place always, but only\r\nat certain seasons of the year. The quail does the same, and domestic\r\nfowls also; for when a new one is offered in the temples, where they\r\nare kept without the females, all in turn are united with it. Tame\r\npartridges have sexual intercourse with wild ones, and strike and\r\ninsult them.\r\n\r\n4. The leader of the wild partridges attacks the partridge used in\r\nfowling, and goes out crowing as if he would fight. When he is taken\r\nin the trap, the other goes out and crows in the same manner. If the\r\npartridge used for fowling is a cock, they behave in this way; but if\r\nit is a female, and she calls, the leader answers her call; and all the\r\nrest rise up and beat him, and drive him away from the female, because\r\nhe attends to her instead of themselves. For this reason he often comes\r\nsilently, that the others may not hear his voice and come out to fight\r\nhim. And some experienced fowlers say that the male approaches the\r\nfemale in silence, that the other males may not hear him and compel him\r\nto fight them. The partridge not only calls, but also utters a shrill\r\ncry and other sounds.\r\n\r\n5. And it often happens, when the hen is sitting, that if she sees the\r\nmale approaching the decoy bird, she will get up from her nest and\r\nremain in his way, that he may have intercourse with her, and not be\r\ndrawn away by the decoy bird. Partridges and quails have such violent\r\nsexual desires that they will fall upon the fowlers and often perch\r\nupon their heads.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n1. This is the mode of the sexual intercourse of the partridge, and\r\nthe way in which they are caught, and the nature of the rest of their\r\ncrafty disposition. Quails, and partridges, and some other birds make\r\ntheir nest upon the ground, as it has been already observed. Of such\r\nbirds the lark, woodcock, and quail do not perch upon trees, but upon\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\n2. The woodpecker does not settle upon the ground, but it strikes\r\ntrees in order to drive out the worms and flies which they contain,\r\nand it picks them up with its tongue as they emerge. Its tongue is\r\nwide and large. It walks upon the trees in any position, even beneath\r\nthe branches, like the gecko. It has claws stronger than those of\r\nthe colœus, which provide for its safety in climbing trees; for it\r\nfixes them in the bark as it walks up the trees. There is one kind of\r\nwoodpecker less than the blackbird, covered with small red spots, and\r\nanother kind larger than the blackbird, and a third kind nearly as\r\nlarge as the domestic hen. It builds its nest upon trees, as it has\r\nbeen already observed, both on olive and other trees; and it feeds upon\r\nants and worms which live in trees. It hunts for worms so diligently\r\nthat they say it hollows out the trees so much as to throw them down.\r\nA tame bird has been known to place an almond in a crack in wood, to\r\nprepare it for the stroke of its bill, and break it with three blows,\r\nin order to eat the kernel.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nMany prudent actions appear to be performed by cranes; for they travel\r\ngreat distances, and fly at a great elevation, in order that they may\r\nsee farther; and if they see clouds and wintry weather, they descend\r\nand rest themselves. They have also a leader in front; and in the rear\r\nare those which give a signal by whistling, so that their voice may be\r\nheard. When they settle on the ground, the rest sleep with their head\r\nunder the wing, first on one foot, then on the other; but the leader\r\nwatches with his neck stretched out, and when he sees anything he gives\r\na signal by his cry. The pelicans, which inhabit the rivers, swallow\r\nlarge smooth shells with their drink, and when they have been digested\r\nin the first part of their stomach, they vomit them up, in order that\r\nthey may pick out and eat their flesh when they open their valves.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n1. The habitations of wild birds are contrived with relation to their\r\nmode of life and the preservation of their young. Some of them are\r\nkind to their young and careful of them: others are of a different\r\ndisposition. Some manage well in their mode of life: others do not.\r\nSome dwell in clefts, and holes, and in rocks, as the birds called\r\ncharadrius. This bird is faulty both in its colours and its voice. It\r\nappears during the night, and escapes in the day time.\r\n\r\n2. The hawk also builds in precipitous places; and although it is\r\ncarnivorous, it does not devour the heart of the bird it has killed.\r\nSome have observed this with respect to the quail and thrush, and\r\nothers with other birds. There is also a change in their mode of\r\nhunting their prey, for they do not seize them in the same way in\r\nsummer and in winter. It is said that no one has ever seen the young\r\nor the nest of the carrion vulture. Wherefore Herodorus, the father\r\nof Brison the sophist, says that they come from some distant elevated\r\nland, using this proof, that many of them appear suddenly, but where\r\nthey come from is not intelligible to any one. The reason is this,\r\nthey make their nest in inaccessible rocks, and the bird is not an\r\ninhabitant of many countries. It produces one egg or two at the most.\r\n\r\n3. Some birds dwell in mountains and in woods, as the hoopoe and\r\nbrenthus. This bird has a good habit of life and a good voice. The\r\ntrochilus dwells in thickets and holes. It is taken with difficulty,\r\nfor it is swift in flight, and its disposition is weak; but its mode of\r\nlife is good, and it is artful. It is also called presbys and basileus.\r\nWherefore also they say that it fights with the eagle.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n1. There are some which live near the sea, as the cinclus. In\r\ndisposition this bird is cunning and difficult of capture, and when\r\ntaken easily tamed. It appears to be lame, for its hinder parts are\r\nweak. All birds with webbed feet live near the sea, or near rivers and\r\nponds, for their nature teaches them to seek what is advantageous for\r\nthem. Many of those with divided feet live near waters and marshes, as\r\nthe anthus in the neighbourhood of rivers. Its colour is beautiful,\r\nand its mode of life good. The diver lives near the sea, and when it\r\nplunges into the sea it remains as long a time as it would take a man\r\nto walk over a plethrum of ground. This bird is less than a hawk.\r\n\r\n2. The swan also is web-footed, and lives in ponds and marshes. Its\r\nmanner of life and disposition is good, and so is its mode of rearing\r\ntheir young and its old age. If an eagle attacks the swan, it defends\r\nitself and comes off victorious, but will not commence the fight. Swans\r\nhave the power of song, especially when near the end of their life; for\r\nthey then fly out to sea, and some persons, sailing near the coast of\r\nLibya, have met many of them in the sea singing a mournful song, and\r\nhave afterwards seen some of them die.\r\n\r\n3. The cymindis is seldom seen, for it inhabits mountains. It is black,\r\nand about the size of the hawk called pigeon hawk. Its form is long and\r\nslight. (It shines with a metallic lustre, wherefore also it is called\r\nchalcis.) The Ionians call it cymindis: wherefore Homer writes in the\r\nIliad, \"the bird which the gods call chalcis, and mortals cymindis.\"\r\n(Some persons say that the hybris is the same bird as the ptynx.)\r\nThis bird does not show itself in the day-time because its sight is\r\ndim; but it hunts its prey during the night like the eagle. It fights\r\nso fiercely with the eagle that both are often taken alive by the\r\nshepherds. It lays two eggs, and builds in rocks and caverns. Cranes\r\nfight so fiercely with each other that these also are taken alive by\r\nthe shepherds while they are fighting. The crane lays two eggs.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n1. The jay changes its voice frequently, for it utters a different one,\r\nas we may say, almost every day; it lays about nine eggs; it makes its\r\nnest upon trees, of hair and wool; when the acorns fall, it conceals\r\nand stores them up. Many persons have reported that the stork is fed\r\nby its young, and some people say the merops also, and that they are\r\nfed by the young, not only in their old age, but as soon as the young\r\nbirds are able to do so, and that the parents remain within the nest;\r\nin appearance, this bird is green beneath the wings, and blue above, as\r\nthe kingfisher, and its wings are red at the extremity. It lays six or\r\nseven eggs in the autumn, in muddy caverns, and digs as much as four\r\ncubits into the ground.\r\n\r\n2. The bird called chloris from being yellow beneath, is of the size of\r\nthe lark, and lays four or five eggs; it makes its nest of symphytum,\r\nwhich it pulls up by the root, and lines it with straw, hair, and\r\nwool. The blackbird and jay do the same, and line their nests with\r\nthe same materials; the nest of the acanthyllis is also artfully\r\nconstructed, for it is folded together like a ball of flax, and has a\r\nsmall entrance. And the natives of those places say that there is a\r\ncinnamon bird, and that they bring the cinnamon from the same places\r\nas the bird, and that it makes its nest of it. It builds its nest in\r\nlofty trees and among their branches, but the natives of the country\r\ntip their arrows with lead, with which they destroy the nests, and then\r\npick out the cinnamon from the other material.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n1. The halcyon is not much larger than a sparrow; its colour is blue\r\nand green, and somewhat purple; its whole body is composed of these\r\ncolours as well as the wings and neck, nor is any part without every\r\none of these colours. Its bill is somewhat yellow, long, and slight;\r\nthis is its external form. Its nest resembles the marine balls which\r\nare called halosachnæ,[227] except in colour, for they are red; in\r\nform it resembles those sicyæ (cucumbers) which have long necks; its\r\nsize is that of a very large sponge, for some are greater, others\r\nless. They are covered up, and have a thick solid part as well as the\r\ncavity; it is not easily cut with a sharp knife, but when struck or\r\nbroken with the hand, it divides readily like the halosachnæ. The mouth\r\nis narrow, as it were a small entrance, so that the sea-water cannot\r\nenter, even if the sea is rough; its cavity is like that of the sponge;\r\nthe material of which the nest is composed is disputed, but it appears\r\nto be principally composed of the spines of the belone, for the bird\r\nitself lives on fish. It also ascends rivers; it does not produce more\r\nthan five eggs; it continues to reproduce throughout the whole of its\r\nlife, from the time of being four months old.\r\n\r\n[227] Probably a Zoophyte, Alcyonia.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n1. The hoopoe generally makes its nest of human ordure. It changes\r\nits appearance in summer and winter, like most other wild birds. The\r\ntitmouse, as they say, lays the greatest number of eggs, some say that\r\nthe bird called melancoryphus lays the greatest number of eggs after\r\nthe Libyan sparrow, seventeen have been observed, but it will produce\r\nmore than twenty, and, as they say, it always lays a great many. This\r\nbird also builds in trees, and lives upon worms. It is characteristic\r\nof this bird and the nightingale not to have any tip to their tongue.\r\nThe ægithus has a good mode of life, and is careful of its young, but\r\nis lame upon its feet. The chlorion is a clever and diligent bird, but\r\nits flight is difficult, and its colours bad.\r\n\r\n2. The elea, like some other birds, has an excellent mode of life, and\r\ndwells during the summer in groves and in the shade, and during the\r\nwinter in sunshine, perching upon the reeds on the sides of marshes. It\r\nis a small bird, with a good voice.\r\n\r\n3. The bird called gnaphalus has a sweet voice, its colours are\r\nbeautiful, its mode of life good, and its form elegant; it appears to\r\nbe a foreign bird, for it is rarely found in places where there are no\r\nhouses.\r\n\r\n4. The disposition of the crex is pugnacious, but it is ingenious in\r\nproviding for its own subsistence, though otherwise an unfortunate\r\nbird. The sitta is pugnacious, but its disposition is gentle and\r\ntractable, and its mode of life good. It is said to be medicinal, for\r\nit is skilful in many things. It produces many young, which it treats\r\nwith kindness, and obtains its food by striking trees.\r\n\r\n5. The little owl feeds during the night, and is rarely visible by day.\r\nIt lives in rocks and caverns, for its food is of two kinds; and in\r\ndisposition it is diligent and ingenious. There is a small bird called\r\ncerthius, which is bold in disposition, and lives on trees and eats the\r\nthrips (timber worm). In disposition it is diligent in search of food,\r\nand its voice is brilliant. The disposition and hue of the acanthis is\r\nbad, but it has a shrill voice.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n1. Among the herons, as it was before observed, the black heron\r\ncopulates with difficulty, but it is an ingenious bird. It carries its\r\nfood about, and is skilful in procuring it. It works during the day.\r\nIts colour, however, is bad, and its stomach always fluid. Of the other\r\ntwo (for there are three kinds of them), the white heron is beautifully\r\ncoloured and copulates without pain, and builds its nest and attends\r\nits young carefully in trees. It inhabits marshes and lakes, plains\r\nand meadows. The bittern, which is called ocnus (the idle), is said in\r\nfables to have been originally a slave. Its name indicates its very\r\nidle disposition.\r\n\r\n2. The herons live in this manner. The bird called poyx is peculiar,\r\nfor it is its disposition to eat the eyes of other creatures, and is\r\ntherefore the enemy of the harpa, which lives upon the same food.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n1. There are two kinds of cottyphus. The one is black, and is found\r\neverywhere; the other is white. In size they are alike, and their\r\nvoice is very similar. The white one is found in Cyllene, in Arcadia,\r\nand nowhere else. The læus is similar to the black cottyphus, but is\r\nrather smaller. It makes its house upon rocks and tiles. It has not a\r\ndark beak, like the blackbird.\r\n\r\n2. Of thrushes there are three forms. The one is called misselthrush,\r\nfor it lives upon nothing but miseltoe and resin. It is as large as\r\nthe citta; the other is called fieldfare. The voice of this bird is\r\nshrill; its size is that of the blackbird. There is another kind, which\r\nsome persons call illas, which is smaller than the others and less\r\nvariegated.\r\n\r\n3. There is a certain bird living on rocks, which is called blue\r\nthrush. This bird generally inhabits Scyrus. It lives upon the wing.\r\nIt is less than the blackbird, but larger than the finch. Its feet\r\nare black, and it climbs up upon rocks. It is entirely blue. It has a\r\nsmooth, long beak, but its legs are short, and resemble those of the\r\nwoodpecker.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n1. The oriole is entirely of a yellowish green. This bird is not\r\nvisible in the winter. It is seen in the greatest numbers at the summer\r\nsolstice, and takes its departure when Arcturus rises. It is of the\r\nsame size as the turtle. The malacocraneus always perches upon the\r\nsame place, and is captured there. This is its appearance: its head\r\nis large, and has the form of cartilage; its size is smaller than the\r\nthrush; its beak is strong, small, and round; its colour is entirely\r\ncinereous; its feet are strong, and its wings weak; it is generally\r\ncaptured by the owl.\r\n\r\n2. There is another bird, called the pardalus, which is generally\r\ngregarious, and a single bird is never seen. Its colour is entirely\r\ncinereous. In size it resembles those already mentioned. Its feet are\r\nstrong, and its wings are not weak. Its voice is frequent and not deep.\r\nThe collyrion lives on the same food as the blackbird, and in size much\r\nresembles those just named. It is generally taken in the winter. These\r\nbirds are visible all the year round, and so are those which live in\r\nthe neighbourhood of towns, the raven and crow; for these are always\r\nvisible, and neither migrate nor conceal themselves.\r\n\r\n3. Of the jackdaw there are three kinds, one called coracias, which is\r\nas large as the crow, and has a red beak; another is called lycius;\r\nthere is also a small one called bomolochus; there is also another\r\nkind of jackdaw in Lydia and Phrygia which is web-footed.\r\n\r\n4. Of the lark there are two kinds. One dwells on the ground, and has\r\na crest. The other is gregarious, and not solitary. Its colour is\r\nsimilar, though it is a smaller bird, and has no crest. It is used for\r\nfood.\r\n\r\n5. The ascalopas is generally taken in enclosed gardens. It is of the\r\nsize of the domestic fowl, it has a long beak, and in colour resembles\r\nthe attagen. It runs quickly, and is very partial to the neighbourhood\r\nof mankind. The starling is variegated, and is of the size of the\r\nblackbird.\r\n\r\n6. There are two kinds of ibis in Egypt; the white and the black. The\r\nwhite live in all the rest of Egypt, but are not found in Pelusium. The\r\nblack occur in Pelusium, but not in other parts of Egypt.\r\n\r\n7. One kind of scops, called brown owl, is seen throughout the year,\r\nbut it is not eaten, for it is not fit for food. Others occur sometimes\r\nin the autumn, when they appear for one, or not more than two days.\r\nThey are eatable, and are highly esteemed. They differ in no respect\r\nfrom the brown owl, except in fatness; and they are silent, whereas the\r\nother has a voice. No observations have ever been made on their mode of\r\ngeneration, except that they appear when the west wind blows. This is\r\nmanifest.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n1. The cuckoo, as it has been already observed, makes no nest, but lays\r\nits eggs in the nests of other birds, especially in that of the phaps,\r\nand in those of the sparrow and lark on the ground, and in the nest\r\nof the chloris in trees. It lays one egg, upon which it does not sit,\r\nbut the bird in whose nest it lays both hatches the egg and nurses the\r\nyoung bird; and, as they say, when the young cuckoo grows, it ejects\r\nthe other young birds, which thus perish.\r\n\r\n2. Others say that the mother bird kills them, and feeds the young\r\ncuckoo with them; for the beauty of the young cuckoo makes her despise\r\nher own offspring. People assert that they have been eye-witnesses of\r\nmost of these circumstances, but all are not equally agreed as to the\r\nmode in which the other young birds perish. Some persons say that\r\nthe old cuckoo comes and devours the young of the other bird. Others\r\nsay that the great size of the young cuckoo enables it to seize upon\r\nthe food which is brought to the nest, so that the rest perish from\r\nstarvation. Others say that the cuckoo, being the stronger bird, kills\r\nthose that are brought up with it.\r\n\r\n3. The cuckoo appears to act prudently in thus depositing her egg; for\r\nit is conscious of its own timidity, and that it cannot defend its\r\nyoung, and therefore places them under the protection of another bird,\r\nin order that they may be preserved; for this bird is very cowardly,\r\nand when it is pecked by even small birds, it flies away from them.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n1. That the swift, which some persons call cypsellus, resembles the\r\nswallow, has been already observed, and it is not easy to distinguish\r\nthem apart, except that the legs of the apos are covered with feathers.\r\nThese birds rear their young in small nests made of mud, which have a\r\npassage sufficient for their admission. The nest is constructed in a\r\nnarrow place under rocks and caverns, so that it avoids both beasts and\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n2. The goatsucker, as it is called, is a mountain bird, larger than\r\nthe blackbird, and less than the cuckoo. It lays two, or not more than\r\nthree eggs, and is slothful in its disposition. It flies against the\r\ngoats and sucks them, whence its name (ægothelas, the goat-sucker).\r\nThey say that when the udder has been sucked that it gives no more\r\nmilk, and that the goat becomes blind. This bird is not quick sighted\r\nby day, but sees well at night.\r\n\r\n3. The ravens in small districts, and where they have not food enough,\r\nare found only in pairs; and as soon as their young birds are able to\r\nfly, the old birds first of all turn them out of the nest, and then\r\ndrive them from the place. The raven lays four or five eggs. When\r\nthe hired soldiers of Medias perished in Pharsalus, Athens and the\r\nPeloponnesus were deserted by the ravens, as if they had some means of\r\ncommunication with each other.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n1. There are several kinds of eagles. One which is called pygargus\r\n(hen-harrier), which is found in plains and groves, and in the\r\nvicinity of towns. Some persons call it nebrophonus. It is a courageous\r\nbird, and flies to mountains, and woods also. The other kinds rarely\r\nappear in plains and groves. There is another kind of eagle called\r\nplangus, the second in point of size and strength, which lives among\r\nthickets, and valleys, and marshes. It is called nettophonus and\r\nmorphnus. Of this kind Homer speaks at the departure of Priam.\r\n\r\n2. There is another kind, which is black. It is smaller, and stronger\r\nthan the others. It inhabits mountains and woods. It is called\r\nmelanæetus, and lagophonus. This is the only one that rears and\r\neducates its young. It is swift, elegant, liberal, fearless, warlike,\r\nand of a good omen, for it neither cries nor screams. There is another\r\nkind with spotted wings. It has a white head, and is the largest of all\r\neagles. Its wings are short, and its rump very long, like the vulture;\r\nit is called oreipelargus, and hypæetus. It inhabits groves. It has all\r\nthe faults of the rest, and none of their good qualities; for it is\r\ntaken and pursued by ravens and other birds. It is a heavy bird, and\r\nits mode of life is bad. It carries about dead creatures; it is always\r\nhungry, and screams and cries.\r\n\r\n3. There is another kind of eagle called sea eagle, which has a long\r\nand thick neck, curved wings, and a wide rump. It inhabits the sea and\r\nthe coast. When they have seized their prey, and cannot carry it away,\r\nthey are borne down into the sea. There is, again, another kind of\r\neagle, called true eagle. They say that these alone of all other birds\r\nare true, for the other kinds are mixed and crossed with each other,\r\nboth eagles, hawks, and other smaller kinds. This is the largest of all\r\nthe eagles, greater than the phene; one and a half times as large as\r\nother eagles, and of a red colour: it is seldom seen, like that called\r\ncymindis.\r\n\r\n4. The time for the activity of the eagle, and for its flight, is from\r\ndinner till the evening, for it sits aloft till the time when the\r\nmarket-place begins to fill. When eagles grow old, their beaks become\r\nmore and more curved, so that at last they die of famine. The story\r\ngoes, that the eagle was once a man, and suffers this as a punishment\r\nfor inhospitality to a guest. Any superabundant food is put aside for\r\ntheir young in their nests, for it is not easy for them to procure it\r\nevery day, and sometimes they have no place from whence to bring it.\r\n\r\n5. If they find anyone attempting to take their nest, they beat them\r\nwith their wings, and tear them with their claws. They do not make\r\ntheir nests in plains, but in high places, especially in precipitous\r\nrocks, but never on trees. They rear their young till they can fly, and\r\nthen turn them out of their nests, and drive them to a great distance;\r\nfor one pair of eagles occupies a wide space of country, so that they\r\nwill suffer no others to live near them.\r\n\r\n6. They do not hunt their prey near their nests, but at a considerable\r\ndistance; and when they have hunted and taken anything, they lay it\r\ndown and do not take it away at once, but carry it away when they have\r\ntried its weight. They do not capture hares at once, but let them\r\nescape to the plain. They do not descend to the plain at once, but with\r\nlarge though gradually decreasing circles. They do this in order that\r\nthey may not be ensnared. They settle upon eminences, because they\r\ncannot rise easily from the ground. They fly aloft, that they may see\r\nthe greater extent of country. For this cause men say that the eagle is\r\nthe only divine bird.\r\n\r\n7. All birds with crooked claws avoid sitting upon rocks, for its\r\nhardness is injurious to their claws. The eagle hunts fawns, hares, and\r\nother animals which it is able to conquer. It is a long-lived bird.\r\nThis is plain from the long continuance of their nests in the same\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n8. In Scythia there is a kind of bird as large as a bustard, which\r\nproduces two young ones. It does not sit upon its eggs, but hides them\r\nin the skin of a hare or fox. It watches them from a neighbouring tree\r\nall the while it is not engaged in hunting its prey. And if anyone\r\napproaches them, it fights and strikes with its wings, like the eagle.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n1. The owl and nycticorax, and the other birds which see imperfectly by\r\ndaylight, procure their food by hunting in the night. They do not this\r\nall the night, but in twilight and at early dawn. They hunt mice, and\r\nlizards, and beetles, and such other small animals.\r\n\r\n2. The bird called asprey produces many young, is of a good habit\r\nof body, diligent in search of food, and gentle; and feeds both its\r\nown young and those of the eagle: for when the eagle turns out its\r\nyoung, the phene takes them up and feeds them; for the eagle ejects\r\nthem before the proper time, when they still require feeding, and are\r\nunable to fly. The eagle appears to eject its young from the nest from\r\nenvy; for it is an envious and hungry bird, and not quick in seizing\r\nits prey. It captures large creatures when it can. When its young have\r\ngrown, it envies them, for they are good for food, and tears them with\r\nits claws. The young also fight in the nest for particular places, and\r\nfor the food. The parent then turns them out of the nest and strikes\r\nthem. When they are turned out they begin to scream, and the phene\r\ncomes and takes them up. The phene is dim-sighted, and its eyes are\r\nimperfect.\r\n\r\n3. The sea-eagle is very quick-sighted, and compels its young to gaze\r\non the sun before they are feathered. If anyone of them refuse, it is\r\nbeaten and turned round: and the one of them which first weeps when\r\ngazing on the sun is killed, the other is reared. It lives near the sea\r\nside, and obtains its food by pursuing marine birds, as it was before\r\nremarked. It pursues and takes them one at a time, watching them as\r\nthey emerge from the sea. And if the bird, as it rises, sees the eagle\r\nwatching it, it dives again from fear, in order that it may rise again\r\nin another place: but the eagle's quick sight enables him to pursue the\r\nbird till it is either suffocated, or taken on the wing; but it never\r\nattacks them in any numbers, for they drive it away by sprinkling it\r\nwith their wings.\r\n\r\n4. The petrels are taken with foam, for they devour it. They are\r\ntherefore taken by sprinkling them. All the rest of its flesh is good;\r\nthe rump alone smells of seaweed, and they are fat.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\n1. The buzzard is the strongest of the hawks; next to this the merlin.\r\nThe circus is less strong; the asterias and phassophonus, and pternis\r\nare different. The wide-winged hawks are called hypotriorches, others\r\nare called perci and spiziæ; others are the eleii and the phrynolochi;\r\nthese birds live very easily, and fly near the ground.\r\n\r\n2. Some persons say that there are no less than ten kinds of hawks;\r\nthey differ from each other, for some of them kill the pigeon as\r\nit perches on the ground, and carry it away, but do not touch it in\r\nflight; others attack it as it sits upon the trees, or in some such\r\nsituation, but will not touch it when upon the ground or in flight;\r\nother kinds of hawks will not strike the bird when perching upon the\r\nground or anywhere else, but will endeavour to attack it when in flight.\r\n\r\n3. They say that the pigeons can distinguish each of these kinds, so\r\nthat if they see one of those which attack them in the air flying\r\ntowards them, they remain sitting where they are, but if it is one of\r\nthose which strike them on the ground, they do not remain still, but\r\nfly away.\r\n\r\n4. In the city of Thrace, formerly called Cedropolis, men are assisted\r\nby hawks in pursuing birds in the marshes. They strike the reeds and\r\nwood with sticks in order that the birds may fly up, and the hawks\r\nappearing above pursue them, the birds then fall to the earth through\r\nfear, when the men strike them with their sticks and take them, and\r\ndivide the prey with the hawks, for they throw away some of the birds,\r\nand the hawks come and take them.\r\n\r\n5. On the Palus Mœotis, they say that wolves are accustomed to assist\r\nthe fishermen in their calling, and if they do not give them their\r\nshare of the food, they destroy the nets that are laid to dry on the\r\nground. This, then, is the nature of birds.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\n1. Marine animals also have many artful ways of procuring their food,\r\nfor the stories that are told of the batrachus, which is called the\r\nfisher, are true, and so are those of the narce. For the batrachus\r\nhas appendages above its eyes, of the length of a hair, with a round\r\nextremity to each like a bait; it buries itself in the sand or mud,\r\nand raises these appendages above the surface, and when the small fish\r\nstrike them, it draws them down, till it brings the fish within reach\r\nof its mouth.\r\n\r\n2. The narce stupefies any fish it may wish to master, with the\r\npeculiar force which it has in its body, and then takes and feeds upon\r\nthem; it lies concealed in sand and mud, and captures as they swim\r\nover it any fish that it can take and stupefy; of this circumstance\r\nmany persons have been witnesses; the trygon also hides itself, but not\r\nin the same manner; the following is a proof of their mode of life, for\r\nthey are often taken with the cestreus in their stomach, which is the\r\nswiftest of fishes, and they are the slowest; and the batrachus, when\r\nnothing is left on the hair-like appendages, is taken in an emaciated\r\ncondition. The narce also has plainly caused stupefaction in men.\r\n\r\n3. The onus, batus, psetta, and rhine also bury themselves in the sand,\r\nand when they have hidden themselves, the appendage which is in their\r\nmouth stands up, this the fishermen call their staff, and the small\r\nfish approach it as if it was the sea-weed, on which they usually live.\r\nWherever the anthias is found there are no obnoxious creatures; when\r\nthis sign is observed, those who collect sponges dive for them there,\r\nand call the anthias the sacred fish; this is only a coincidence, just\r\nas the pig and partridge are never found where there are snails, for\r\nthey eat them all.\r\n\r\n4. The marine-serpent, in colour and in the form of its body, resembles\r\nthe conger, but it is darker, and more powerful. If it is captured\r\nand allowed to escape, it buries itself in the sand, which it pierces\r\nwith its snout, for its snout is sharper than that of a serpent. The\r\ncreature called scolopendra when it has swallowed the hook turns itself\r\ninside out, till the hook is ejected, when it turns to its original\r\nform. The scolopendra, like that which inhabits the land, is attracted\r\nby the smell of cooked meat; it does not bite with the mouth, but\r\nstings with the contact of the whole body, like the creatures called\r\nsea-nettles.\r\n\r\n5. The fish called alopex, when one of them has swallowed the hook,\r\nassist each other in this matter, as the scolopendra also does, for\r\nthey collect together round the line and bite it off; in some places,\r\nwhere the water is swift and deep, they are taken with many hooks\r\nin them. The amiæ also collect together when they see any obnoxious\r\ncreature near them, and the largest swim round them in a circle; when\r\nattacked, they defend themselves; they have strong teeth, and the lamia\r\nand other creatures when attacking them have been seen to be repulsed\r\nwith wounds.\r\n\r\n6. Among river fish the male glanis is very careful of his young fry,\r\nbut the female goes away as soon as she has deposited her ova, but the\r\nmale continues to watch by the greater number of the ova, paying them\r\nno more attention than to drive away other fish, that they may not\r\ncarry away the ova; he is thus employed for forty or fifty days until\r\nthe young fry are so far grown that they can escape from other fish;\r\nthe fishermen know when it is guarding its ova, for it drives away\r\nother fish, and as it jumps at them it makes a noise and a murmur. It\r\nremains with such affection beside its ova, that if they are deposited\r\nin deep water, and the fishermen attempt to bring them into shallow\r\nwater, the fish will not forsake them; but if young it is easily taken\r\nwith a hook, from its habit of seizing upon any fish that may come in\r\nits way; but if it is experienced, and has swallowed a hook before,\r\nit does not leave its ova, but with its hard teeth it will bite and\r\ndestroy the hook.\r\n\r\n7. All creatures with fins, and stationary animals, inhabit either\r\nthe places in which they were born, or similar localities, for their\r\npeculiar food is found in such places. The carnivorous fish are the\r\ngreatest wanderers; all are carnivorous with a few exceptions, as the\r\ncestreus, salpa, trigla, and chalcis. The mucous substance which the\r\npholis emits forms around it, and resembles a chamber. Of the apodal\r\ntestacea, the pecten is the most locomotive, for it flies by means of\r\nits own valves; the purpura and its congeners advance very slowly.\r\n\r\n8. All the fish except the cobius leave the Pyrrhic Euripus during the\r\nwinter on account of the cold, for the Euripus is colder than the sea,\r\nand return again in the spring. In the Euripus the scarus, the thrissa,\r\nall the thorny fish, the galus, acanthia, carabus, polypus, bolitæna,\r\nand some others are wanting, and of those that are produced in the\r\nEuripus, the white cobius is not an inhabitant of the sea. Those fish\r\nwhich have ova are in the highest season in the spring, before they\r\nproduce their ova; those that are viviparous in the autumn, and besides\r\nthese the cestreus, trigla, and their congeners. In the neighbourhood\r\nof Lesbos, both the marine fish and those of the Euripus produce their\r\nova in the Euripus; they copulate in the autumn, and deposit their ova\r\nin the spring. The males and females of the selachea also mix together,\r\nin numbers, in the autumn, for the purpose of copulation; but in the\r\nspring they separate until they have produced their young; at the\r\nperiod of sexual intercourse, they are often taken united together.\r\n\r\n9. The sepia is the most cunning of the malacia, and is the only one\r\nwhich uses its ink for the purpose of concealment, when it is not\r\nalarmed. The polypus and teuthis emit their ink only when alarmed.\r\nThese creatures never emit all their ink, and as soon as it is emitted\r\nit is secreted again. But the sepia, as it has already been remarked,\r\nmakes use of its ink for the purposes of concealment, and when it\r\npretends to advance, it returns into its ink. With its long extended\r\ntentacula it not only pursues small fish, but frequently attacks the\r\ncestreus. The polypus is a foolish creature, for it will approach a\r\nman's hand if brought near it. It is an economical animal, for it\r\ncollects all its prey in the hole in which it dwells, and when the most\r\nuseful part has been consumed, it ejects the shells, the coverings of\r\nthe cancri, and conchylia, and the spines of the fish, it pursues any\r\nfish that may come in its way, changing its colour and imitating that\r\nof any neighbouring stone. It does the same thing when alarmed.\r\n\r\n10. Some persons say that the sepia has power to do the same thing,\r\nand that it can imitate the colour of the place it inhabits. The rhine\r\nis the only fish endowed with the same power, for it can change its\r\ncolours like the polypus. The polypus rarely lives for two years,\r\nfor it is by nature subject to decay. This is a proof of it, that\r\nwhen pressed, this animal always emits something, until at last it\r\nconsumes away. The females suffer so much from this in the period of\r\nparturition, as to become foolish, and not perceive any agitation of\r\nthe waves, so that they are easily taken by the hand of the diver; they\r\nbecome like mucus, and are not able to pursue their prey.\r\n\r\n11. The males become hard and shining. This appears to be a proof\r\nthat they do not survive a year, that in the summer and autumn, after\r\nthe production of the young, it is difficult to find a large polypus,\r\nthough large ones were abundant a short time before; when they have\r\nproduced their ova, they say that both sexes grow old and become so\r\nweak, that they are devoured by small fish, and are easily dragged out\r\nof their holes, though before they would have permitted nothing of the\r\nkind. They also say that the small and young ones will not endure this,\r\nand that they are stronger than the large ones. The sepia also only\r\nlives one year; the polypus is the only one of the malacia that ever\r\nventures upon dry land, it advances upon a rough surface, but avoids\r\nsmooth places. In other respects, it is a strong animal, but its neck,\r\nif pressed, becomes very weak.\r\n\r\n12. This is the nature of the malacia. They say that ... form their\r\nrough shells round themselves like a hard breastplate, which increases\r\nas they grow, and that they can leave these, as if they were a hole or\r\na habitation. The nautilus is a polypus peculiar both in its nature\r\nand its actions; for it sails upon the surface of the sea, rising up\r\nfrom the depths of the waters. It is brought to the surface with its\r\nshell inverted, in order that it may go out more easily and navigate in\r\nan empty shell. When it reaches the surface, it turns its shell over.\r\nThere is a membrane extended between two of its tentacula similar to\r\nthe web feet of birds, except that theirs is thick and that of the\r\nnautilus thin and like a spider's web. This it uses for a sail when\r\nthe wind blows, and it extends two of its tentacula for rudders. If\r\nalarmed, it fills its shell and sinks in the sea. No one has made any\r\naccurate observation on the production and growth of the shell. It\r\nappears not to originate in sexual intercourse, but to be produced like\r\nthat of other conchylia, nor is it clear whether it can live when taken\r\nout of its shell.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\n1. The most laborious of all insects, if compared with the rest, are\r\nthe tribes of ants and bees, with the hornets, wasps, and their other\r\ncongeners. Some of the spiders are more neat, graceful, and skilful\r\nthan others in their mode of life. Every one may see the diligence of\r\nthe ant; for it is on the surface, and that they always travel in one\r\ndirection, and make a store and treasure-house of food, for they work\r\neven in the night when there is a full moon.\r\n\r\n2. There are many kinds of spiders and phalangia. Of the phalangia that\r\nbite there are two sorts. The one resembles those called wolves. It is\r\nsmall, variegated, sharp, and active in jumping. It is called psylla.\r\nThe other is larger. Its colour is black, and its fore-legs are long.\r\nIts movements are slow, and it can scarcely walk. It is not strong,\r\nnor capable of jumping. The other kinds, which the dealers in medicine\r\noffer for sale, either do not bite at all, or very slightly.\r\n\r\n3. There is another kind of those called wolves. One is small, and\r\nmakes no web, and the larger sort makes a coarse inferior web upon the\r\nground or in hedges. It always makes its web over chinks in the soil,\r\nand with the origin of the web in the interior it keeps guard until\r\nsomething falls into the web and moves it, when it comes out. The\r\nvariegated kind makes a small inferior web among trees.\r\n\r\n4. There is another third kind, which is very skilful and graceful.\r\nIt commences the process of weaving by extending its web to the\r\nextremities on all sides, and then it draws a thread from the centre,\r\nand takes up the centre correctly. Upon these threads it weaves, as it\r\nwere, the woof, and then weaves them altogether. Its sleeping place and\r\nstore-room are situated at a distance. In seeking its prey it watches\r\nin the middle of its web. When anything falls into the web and the\r\ncentre is moved, the spider surrounds and encloses it in a web, until\r\nit is rendered powerless, and then takes it up and carries it to her\r\nstore. If hungry, she sucks it, for this is their method of enjoyment;\r\nand if not hungry, hastens back for the pursuit of more prey, and in\r\nthe first place mends her broken web.\r\n\r\n5. If anything in the meanwhile has fallen into the web, she first goes\r\nto the centre, and from that point, as before, falls upon her victim.\r\nIf anyone destroys the web, she begins spinning again at the rising or\r\nsetting of the sun, for it is at this time that her prey usually falls\r\ninto the web. The female both makes the web and pursues the prey. The\r\nmale only enjoys it with her.\r\n\r\n6. There are two kinds of graceful spiders that spin a thick web, one\r\nlarge and one small. The one with long legs keeps watch suspended\r\nabove its web, that the creatures which fall into the web may not be\r\nfrightened when taken, and then it falls upon them from above, for its\r\nsize prevents it from being easily concealed. But the smaller kind\r\nconceals itself in a small superior chamber of the web.\r\n\r\n7. Spiders have the power of emitting their web as soon as they are\r\nborn, not from within their bodies, as if it were an excrement, as\r\nDemocritus says, but from the surface of their body, like the bark of\r\na tree, or like the ejected spines of some animals, as the porcupine.\r\nThey will attack and surround with their web animals larger than\r\nthemselves; for they will attack small lizards, and beginning at the\r\nmouth, will emit the web until their mouth is covered, and then will\r\napproach and bite them. This is the nature of these animals.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\n1. There is a tribe of insects which has not yet received any name,\r\nalthough in form all the species resemble each other. This tribe\r\nincludes those that form wax, as the bee and those which resemble it\r\nin shape. Of these there are nine sorts, six of which are gregarious,\r\nthe bee, the king bee, the drone, which dwells among the bees, the\r\nannual wasp, the hornet, and tenthredo. These are solitary, the small\r\nsiren, of a tawny colour, and another siren, which is large, black, and\r\nvariegated. The third, which is larger than these, is called bombylius.\r\nThe ants pursue no prey, but only collect that which is already found.\r\nThe spiders do not make anything, nor lay up a store, but only hunt\r\ndown their prey.\r\n\r\n2. Of the rest of the nine kinds already mentioned we will treat\r\nhereafter. The bees do not hunt for prey, but they both produce and\r\nlay up stores. The honey is their food. This is plainly shown when\r\nthe honey dealers attempt to take the combs. When they are fumigated\r\nand suffering from the effects of the smoke, they devour the honey\r\ngreedily, which they are not observed to do at other times; but they\r\nspare it and store it up for food. They have also another kind of food,\r\nwhich is called cerinthus (bee bread), which is of an inferior quality,\r\nand sweet like figs. They carry this upon their legs as they do the wax.\r\n\r\n3. There is great variety in their diligence and mode of life. For\r\nwhen a clean hive is given them, they build their combs, bringing the\r\ndrops from flowers and trees, such as the willow, the elm, and other\r\nglutinous trees. With this also they smear the floor of their hive,\r\nfor fear of other creatures. The honey dealers calls this substance\r\ncommosis, and they build up the entrance of their hive if it is too\r\nwide. They first build cells for their own habitation, then those for\r\nthe kings and the drones. They always build cells for themselves, and\r\nroyal cells when there are many young; but they only build cells for\r\nthe drones when there is plenty of honey.\r\n\r\n4. They make the royal cells near their own. These are small. Those\r\nfor the drones are placed next. These are of a smaller size than those\r\nof the bees. They commence the formation of their combs from the top\r\nof the hives, and carry them down until several reach the floor of the\r\nhive. The cells, whether for the honey or the grubs, are constructed\r\nwith two mouths; for there are two cells built on each base, like a\r\ndouble cup, one on the inside, the other on the outside. The cells at\r\nthe beginning of the comb, near the hives, are joined together for as\r\nmuch as two or three rows in a circle, and are short, and contain no\r\nhoney. The cells which are formed with the greatest quantity of wax\r\ncontain the most honey.\r\n\r\n5. They spread the substance called mitys at the entrance of their\r\nhives, near the opening. This material is black, as if it was the\r\npurification of the wax, and of a harsh smell. It is considered a\r\nremedy for contusions and suppurations. Next to this the pissocerus\r\nis smeared over the floor of the hive. This substance is less useful\r\nthan the mitys in the healing art. Some persons say that the drones\r\nbuild cells for themselves, dividing both the hive and the wax with\r\nthe bees; but they make no honey, but both themselves and their young\r\nare supported by that of the bees. The drones generally remain in the\r\nhives; and if they fly out they rise in the air with a great noise,\r\nwheeling about as if they were exercising; and when they have done this\r\nthey return to the hive and feast themselves on the honey.\r\n\r\n6. The king bees never leave the hives, either for food or any other\r\npurpose, except with the whole swarm; and they say that, if a swarm\r\nwanders to a distance, they will retrace their steps and return until\r\nthey find the king by his peculiar scent. They say also that, when the\r\nking is unable to fly, he is carried by the swarm; and if he perishes,\r\nthe whole swarm dies with him. And if they continue for a time to form\r\ncells, they place no honey in them, and then they also perish.\r\n\r\n7. The bees collect the wax by climbing actively on the flowers with\r\ntheir fore feet. They cleanse these upon the middle pair of legs, and\r\ntheir middle legs again on the curved part of their hind legs, and thus\r\nloaded they fly away. They are evidently heavily loaded. During each\r\nflight the bee does not settle upon flowers of different kinds, but as\r\nit were from violet to violet, and touches no other species till it\r\nreturns to the hive. There they are unloaded, and two or three bees\r\nfollow every one on its return to the hive. It is not easy to see what\r\nis taken, nor has their manner of working it been ever observed. Their\r\nmanner of collecting wax upon the olive trees has been the subject of\r\nobservation; for the thickness of the leaves makes them remain a long\r\nwhile in this tree.\r\n\r\n8. After having done this they produce their young. There is nothing to\r\nprevent there being grubs, and honey, and drones in the same comb. As\r\nlong as the king bee is alive, they say that the drones are produced\r\nin a separate place; but when he is dead they are produced by the bees\r\nin their own cells, and such drones are more passionate: for this\r\ncause they are called stingers, not that they have any sting, but that\r\nthey would sting, if they had the power to do so. The drone cells are\r\nlarger. Sometimes the drone cells are placed by themselves, but are\r\ngenerally combined with those of bees, for which reason they cut them\r\noff.\r\n\r\n9. There are several kinds of bees, as has been already observed: two\r\nkinds of kings, the better sort of which is red, and the other sort\r\nis black and variegated, and in size double that of a good bee. The\r\nbest kind is small, round, and variegated; the other is long, like the\r\nwild bee. There is another called phor (the thief); it is black, and\r\nhas a broad abdomen. The drone is another sort: it is the largest of\r\nthem all, has no sting, and is stupid. The bees that are produced from\r\nthose that inhabit cultivated places are different from the natives\r\nof mountainous countries, for those produced from wood bees are more\r\nhairy, smaller, less, more diligent, and more violent. The best bees\r\nelaborate a smooth comb, with a polished surface. The comb also is of\r\none form, as if entirely adapted for honey, or for grubs, or drones;\r\nand if it happens that all these are produced in the same comb, each\r\nform will be elaborated in order.\r\n\r\n10. The long bees make their combs uneven, and the covering swollen,\r\nlike that of the wild bee. Their offspring, also, and the rest of their\r\nproductions, are not arranged in any order, but according to chance.\r\nAmong them there are many bad kings, and many drones, and thieves, as\r\nthey are called; but little or no honey. The bees sit upon the combs,\r\nin order to bring them to maturity. If this is not done, they say that\r\nthe cells perish and become filled with a web; but if afterwards they\r\nare able to continue sitting, something like an abortion is produced:\r\nif they cannot sit, the whole perishes. Maggots are formed in those\r\ncells that perish, which acquire wings and fly away. If a comb falls\r\ndown, the bees set it up, and put props beneath it, in order that they\r\nmay be able to pass underneath; for if they have no path by which to\r\napproach the place where they sit, the cells become covered with a web.\r\n\r\n11. The thieves and the drones do not work, but only injure the other\r\nbees, and when taken they are killed by the useful bees. Many of their\r\nrulers are also frequently killed, and especially the bad ones, in\r\norder that the swarm may not be dispersed by their numbers. They are\r\nthe more disposed to kill them when the swarm is not fruitful, and no\r\ncasts are formed. At such times they destroy the royal cells, if any\r\nhave been prepared, for they are the leaders of the swarm. They destroy\r\nalso those of the drones, if honey is scarce, or the swarm is short of\r\nhoney. They fight boldly for their honey with those that would take it\r\nfrom them, and drive out any drones that may be in the hive, and are\r\noften seen sitting upon the hives.\r\n\r\n12. The small bees fight eagerly with the long kind, and endeavour\r\nto drive them from their hives: and if they prevail, it seems to be\r\na sign of a very strong swarm; but if the others conquer, when left\r\nalone, they are idle, and do nothing that comes to good, but perish in\r\nthe course of the autumn. Whenever the useful bees kill any of them,\r\nthey endeavour to do so outside of the hive; and if any of them die in\r\nthe hive, they carry them out. Those which are called thieves injure\r\ntheir own combs, and if they can do it in secret, they will enter those\r\nof other bees, but if discovered they are killed. It is, however,\r\ndifficult to enter unperceived, for there are guards placed at each\r\nentrance; and if one contrives to enter unnoticed, he is unable to fly\r\nfrom repletion, and is rolled out before the whole swarm; so that it is\r\ndifficult to escape.\r\n\r\n13. The kings themselves are never seen out of the hives, except with\r\na young swarm, and in young swarms all the rest appear to be collected\r\nround him. When a swarm is about to separate, a peculiar and singular\r\nnoise is made for some days, and for two or three days beforehand a\r\nfew bees are seen flying round the hive; and if the king is among\r\nthem he is not seen, for it is not easy to see him. And when they are\r\ncollected, all the rest fly away and separate themselves with their\r\nrespective kings: and if a few of them happen to be near at hand, they\r\njoin themselves with one of the numerous swarms. And if the king that\r\nthey have left follows them, they kill him. This is the manner of their\r\nleaving the hive, and of swarming.\r\n\r\n14. They all have their proper work to perform. Some bring flowers,\r\nothers water, and others polish and erect the cells. Water is brought\r\nwhen they are rearing their young. None of them ever settle upon flesh,\r\nnor will they eat anything seasoned. They have no particular time for\r\ncommencing work, but when they are properly supplied, and in good\r\nhealth, they are particularly diligent during the summer. When the day\r\nis fine they work without ceasing, and as soon as the young bees are\r\nthree days old, they set to work, if properly fed. And when the swarm\r\nsettles some depart for food, and afterwards return. In healthy swarms\r\nthe progeny of the bees only cease from reproduction[228] for about\r\nforty days after the winter solstice. As soon as the young bees are\r\ngrown, they offer them food, and smear the cells with it, and as soon\r\nas they are strong enough, the young bees rupture the covering of the\r\ncell, and so escape.\r\n\r\n[228] This should probably be read \"the bees only cease from their work\r\nfor forty days during the winter solstice.\"\r\n\r\n15. The good kinds of bees destroy any creatures that are produced\r\nin their hives and destroy the combs; but the other kinds from their\r\ninferiority overlook the destruction of their work. When the dealers\r\nin honey take the combs, they leave the bees some food for the winter.\r\nIf sufficient is left, the swarm is preserved; but if not, they either\r\ndie in the winter, or, if the weather continues fine, desert the\r\nhive. They eat honey both in summer and in winter. They also lay up\r\nanother kind of food, which is as hard as wax, which some persons call\r\nsandarache.\r\n\r\n16. Wasps are very injurious to them, and so is the bird called\r\ntitmouse, and the swallow, and merops. The frogs also in marshes\r\ndestroy them when they come for water, for which reason bee-fanciers\r\ndestroy the frogs in those marshes where the bees come for water. They\r\nalso destroy wasps' nests, and the nest of the swallow and merops, if\r\nnear the swarms of bees. They avoid no animal, except those of their\r\nown kind. They fight among themselves, and with the wasps. When at a\r\ndistance from their hives they will neither injure each other, nor any\r\nother creature; but when near at home they will destroy everything that\r\nthey can conquer.\r\n\r\n17. When they have stung anything they perish, for they cannot withdraw\r\ntheir sting from the wound without tearing their own entrails; but they\r\nare frequently saved, if the person stung will take care to press the\r\nsting from the wound: but when its sting is lost, the bee must perish.\r\nThey will kill even large animals with their stings, and a horse has\r\nbeen known to perish, if attacked by bees. The rulers are the least\r\ncruel and stinging.\r\n\r\n18. If any bees die in the hive, they carry them out; and in other\r\nrespects the bee is a very clean creature. For this reason they also\r\neject their excrement when in flight, for the smell is bad. It has\r\nbeen already observed that they dislike bad smells and the scent of\r\nunguents, and that they sting persons who use such things. They also\r\ndie from other causes, as when the rulers in the hive are in great\r\nnumbers, and each leads out a portion of the swarm. The toad also\r\ndestroys bees, for it blows into the entrance of the hive, and watches\r\nfor and destroys them as they fly out. The bees cannot inflict any\r\ninjury upon it, but their keepers destroy it.\r\n\r\n19. Some bee-keepers say that the kind of bee which makes an inferior\r\nand rough comb is the young of the others, and that it is the result\r\nof imperfect skill. They are young when a year old; young bees do not\r\nsting so severely as old bees; for this reason the swarms are carried\r\nto the apiaries, for they are those of young bees. When honey is short\r\nthey eject the drones, and put figs and other sweet things near them.\r\nThe elder bees work in the hives, and become hairy from remaining\r\nwithin. The younger ones go out in the fields, and are smoother: and\r\nthey kill the drones when they have no longer any room for them, for\r\nthey are placed in a recess of the hive. When a swarm has been weak,\r\nstrange bees have been known to come and fight with them, and take away\r\ntheir honey; and when the bee-keeper killed them the others came out\r\nand defended themselves, and would not injure the man.\r\n\r\n20. Other diseases, and especially one called clerus, frequently attack\r\nstrong swarms. In this disease small worms are produced on the floor of\r\nthe hive, and as these increase, the whole swarm is held, as it were,\r\nin a spider's web, and the combs decay. There is another disease, which\r\nis like a wildness in the bees, and causes a strong smell in the hives.\r\nThe bees should be fed on thyme, the white sort is better than the red.\r\nIn close weather they should have a cool place, and a warm one in the\r\nwinter. They suffer the most when they work with materials affected\r\nwith the rust.\r\n\r\n21. When the wind is high, they carry a stone with them for a balance.\r\nIf a river is at hand they never drink anywhere else, first of all\r\nlaying down their weight. If no river is near, they drink in some other\r\nplace, and then vomit up their honey, and again set to work. There are\r\ntwo seasons for making honey, the spring and autumn. That formed in the\r\nspring is sweeter, whiter, and, on the whole, better than that formed\r\nin autumn. The best honey is made from the new wax and young flowers.\r\nThe red honey is inferior, on account of the wax; for, like wine, it is\r\ninjured by the vessel which contains it; this honey therefore should be\r\ndried up. When the thyme is in flower, and the comb is full of honey,\r\nit does not become inspissated. The gold-coloured honey is also good.\r\nThe white honey is not formed of pure thyme, but is good for the eyes,\r\nand for wounds. Weak honey always floats on the surface, and ought to\r\nbe separated. The pure honey is beneath.\r\n\r\n22. When the woods are in flower the bees form wax; at this season,\r\ntherefore, the wax ought to be taken from the hive, for they\r\nimmediately make more. These are the plants from which they collect it,\r\natractyllis, melilot, asphodel, myrtle, phleos, agnus, broom. When they\r\ncan procure thyme, they mix water with it before they smear the cells.\r\nAll the bees emit their excrements either on the wing, as it has been\r\nsaid before, or into a single cell. The small bees, it has been already\r\nremarked, are more industrious than the large ones, so that their wings\r\nbecome worn at the edges, and their colour black and burnt, but the\r\nbright and shiny bees are idle, like women.\r\n\r\n23. Bees also appear to have pleasure in noises, so that they say that\r\nthey collect them into their hives by striking earthen vessels and\r\nmaking noises. But it is very doubtful whether they hear or not, and if\r\nthey hear, whether they collect together from pleasure or from fear.\r\nThe bees drive out all that are idle or wasteful. They divide the work,\r\nas it has been already said; some work at the honey, others at the\r\ngrubs, and others at the bee bread; some, again, form the comb, others\r\ncarry water to the cells, and mix it with the honey, while others go to\r\nwork. Early in the morning they are silent, until one bee arouses them\r\nby humming two or three times, when they all fly to their work; when\r\nthey return again there is some disturbance at first, which gradually\r\nbecomes less, until one of them flies round with a humming noise, as if\r\nwarning them to sleep, when on a sudden they all become silent.\r\n\r\n24. It is a sign that the swarm is strong when there is much noise\r\nand movement, as they leave and return to the hive, for they are then\r\nbusy with the grubs. They are most hungry when they begin to work\r\nafter winter. They are more idle if the person who takes the honey\r\nleaves much behind, but it is necessary that a quantity should be\r\nleft proportionable to the strength of the swarm, for they work less\r\nactively if too little is left; they become more idle if the hive is\r\nlarge, for they despair of their labour. The hive is deprived of a\r\nmeasure or a measure and a half of honey; if it is strong, two or two\r\nmeasures and a half. Some few will afford three measures.\r\n\r\n25. Sheep and wasps, as it was said above, are hostile to bees. The\r\nbee fanciers, therefore, catch the wasps in pans, in which they place\r\npieces of flesh; when many have fallen in, they put on a lid and put\r\nthem in the fire. It is good for the bees to have a few drones among\r\nthem, for it makes them more industrious. Bees discern the approach of\r\ncold weather and of rain; this is plain, for they will not leave the\r\nhive, but even if the day is fine are occupied in the hive. By this the\r\nbee keepers know that they expect severe weather.\r\n\r\n26. When they are suspended upon each other in the hive, it is a sign\r\nthat the swarm is about to leave; and when the bee keepers see this,\r\nthey sprinkle them with sweet wine. They usually plant about the hive\r\nthe achras, beans, poa medica, syria, ochrus, myrtle, poppy, herypllus,\r\nalmond. Some bee keepers recognize their own bees in the fields by\r\nsprinkling them with flour. When the spring is late or dry, and when\r\nrust is about, the bees are less diligent about their young. This,\r\nthen, is the nature of bees.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\n1. There are two kinds of wasps, of which the wild sort are rare; they\r\nare found in mountains, and do not build their nest in the ground,\r\nbut on oak trees; in form they are larger, longer, and darker than\r\nthe other sort; they are variegated, all of them have stings, and\r\nare strong, and their sting is more painful than that of the other\r\nsorts, for their sting is larger in proportion to their size. These\r\nlive for two years, and in winter are observed to fly out of trees,\r\nwhen they are cut down; during winter they live in holes. Their place\r\nof concealment is in trees; some of them are mother wasps, and some\r\nworkers, as in those which are more domestic; the nature of the workers\r\nand the mother wasps will be explained when we come to speak of the\r\nmore domestic kind.\r\n\r\n2. For there are two kinds of the domestic wasps, the rulers, which\r\nthey call mother wasps, and the workers; the rulers are larger and more\r\ngentle, and the workers do not survive the year, but all of them die,\r\non the arrival of winter. This is plain, for at the beginning of winter\r\nthe workers become stupid, and about the solstice are seen no more;\r\nbut the rulers, which are called mother wasps, are seen during the\r\nwhole of the winter, and bury themselves in the earth; for in ploughing\r\nand digging during the winter, the mother wasps have been frequently\r\nobserved, but no one has ever seen a worker.\r\n\r\n3. The following is the manner of their reproduction: when the rulers\r\nhave found a place properly situated, at the beginning of summer, they\r\nform their combs and build the wasps nests, as they are called; these\r\nare small, with four holes, or thereabouts; in these working wasps are\r\nproduced, and not mother wasps. When these are grown, they afterwards\r\nbuild larger nests, and again larger still, as the swarm increases,\r\nso at the end of autumn the nests are very numerous and large, and in\r\nthese the mother wasps no longer produce workers but mothers. These\r\nlarger maggots are produced on the top of the upper part of the nest,\r\nin four or rather more adjoining cells, very like those of the rulers\r\nin their combs. When the working wasps are produced in the combs,\r\nthe rulers no longer labour, but the workers bring them food; this\r\nis evident, from the rulers never flying away from the workers, but\r\nremaining quietly within.\r\n\r\n4. Whether the rulers of the previous year, when they have produced\r\nnew rulers, die at the same time as the young wasps, or whether they\r\nsurvive a longer period, no one has ever observed, nor has anyone ever\r\nobserved the old age of the mother wasps, or of the wild wasps, or any\r\nother of their affections. The mother wasp is broad and heavy, and\r\nthicker, and larger than the working wasp, and her weight prevents her\r\nfrom being very active in flight, neither can she fly far, but always\r\nsits in the wasps' nests, and fashions and arranges the internal parts.\r\n\r\n5. There are generally mother wasps in the nests, but there is some\r\ndoubt whether they have stings or not; they seem, however, like the\r\nrulers among the bees, to have stings, though they never put them out\r\nnor sting; some wasps, like the drones, are without stings, others have\r\na sting. Those that are without stings are smaller, and not so angry,\r\nneither do they defend themselves; those which are furnished with a\r\nsting are larger, and strong; some call these the males, and those\r\nwhich have no sting the females. Towards winter many of those that have\r\nstings appear to lose them, though we have never met with eye-witnesses\r\nof this circumstance.\r\n\r\n6. Wasps are more abundant in dry seasons and rough places; they\r\nare produced beneath the earth, they make their combs of collected\r\nmaterials and of earth, each springing from one origin, as if from\r\na root. They procure their food from some flowers and fruits, but\r\ngenerally, they are carnivorous. Some persons have observed them in\r\nthe act of sexual intercourse, but whether one or both had stings or\r\nnot, was not seen. Some wild wasps also have been seen in the act\r\nof intercourse, one of them had a sting, whether the other had was\r\nnot observed. Their offspring does not seem to be produced from this\r\nintercourse, but is always larger than the offspring of the wasp should\r\nbe.\r\n\r\n7. If a person takes hold of the legs of a wasp, and permits it to buzz\r\nwith its wings, those that have no stings will fly towards him, which\r\nthose with stings will not do, and some persons consider this to be\r\na sign that the one are males, the other females. Some are taken in\r\ncaverns during the winter with stings, and others without them. Some\r\nof them make small nests and few in number; others make many large\r\nnests. Many of those called mother wasps are taken at the turn of the\r\nseason in the neighbourhood of elms, for they collect the sticky and\r\nglutinous matter. There are a great many mother wasps, when wasps have\r\nbeen abundant during the previous year, and the weather rainy. They\r\nare captured in the neighbourhood of precipitous places and straight\r\nfissures in the earth, and all appear to have stings. This, then, is\r\nthe nature of wasps.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\n1. The wild bees do not live by gathering honey from flowers like the\r\nbees, but are entirely carnivorous, for which reason they frequent the\r\nneighbourhood of dung; for they pursue large flies, and when they have\r\ntaken them they tear off the head and fly away, carrying the rest of\r\nthe body with them. They will also eat sweet fruit. This, then, is the\r\nnature of their food. They have rulers, like the bees and wasps; and\r\nin proportion to the size of the wild bee these rulers are larger than\r\nthose of the bees and wasps. Their rulers also keep in the nest, like\r\nthose of the wasps.\r\n\r\n2. The wild bees make their nest under the soil, which they remove like\r\nthe ants. They never swarm like bees, neither do wasps; but the young\r\nones always remain with them, and as the nest increases they carry out\r\nthe heap of earth. The nests become large; and from a flourishing nest\r\nthree or four baskets of comb have been taken. They do not lay up any\r\nfood like bees, but conceal themselves during the winter. The greater\r\nnumber of them die, but it is not known whether all of them perish.\r\nThere is never more than one ruler in the nest as in the swarm of bees,\r\nor they would divide the nest.\r\n\r\n3. When some of the wild bees wander from the nest, they turn aside\r\nto some material and form another nest, such as are often seen on the\r\nsurface of the soil, and in this they work themselves out a ruler;\r\nand when he is grown he goes out and leads them with him to take\r\npossession of a nest, in which they may dwell. No one has ever made any\r\nobservation on the mode of sexual intercourse in the wild bee, nor on\r\nthe origin of their offspring. Among bees the drones and kings have no\r\nstings, and some of the wasps also are without stings, as it has been\r\nremarked already; but all the wild bees appear to have stings, but more\r\naccurate inquiry should be instituted as to the rulers, whether they\r\nhave stings or not.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nThe humble bees produce their young under stones on the surface of\r\nthe ground in two or a few more cells. The commencement of a kind of\r\ninferior honey is found in them. The tenthredo is like the wild bee,\r\nbut it is variegated, and as broad as the bee. It is a dainty creature,\r\nand the only one which resorts to kitchens, and enjoys fish and such\r\nlike things. It deposits its young under the earth like the wasps. It\r\nis a very productive creature, and its nest is much larger and longer\r\nthan that of the wasp. This is the nature of the work and economy of\r\nbees, wasps, and their congeners.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\n1. It has been already observed that we can distinguish a difference in\r\nthe dispositions of animals, especially in the courage and cowardice,\r\nand then in their mildness and fierceness, even in wild animals. The\r\nlion in his manner of feeding is very cruel; but when he is not hungry,\r\nand is full fed, his disposition is gentle. He is not either jealous\r\nor suspicious. He is fond of playing with and affectionate towards\r\nthose animals which have been brought up with him, and to which he has\r\nbecome accustomed. When hunted, he has never been seen to retreat or\r\nbe alarmed; and if compelled to yield to the numbers of his hunters,\r\nhe retreats slowly and leisurely, and turns himself round at short\r\nintervals. If overtaken in a thicket, he flies rapidly till he reaches\r\nthe open plain, and then again he withdraws slowly. If compelled by\r\nnumbers to retreat openly on the plain ground, he runs at full stretch,\r\nand does not leap. His manner of running is continuous, like that of a\r\ndog at full stretch. When pursuing his prey, he throws himself upon it\r\nwhen he comes within reach.\r\n\r\n2. It is, however, true, as they say, that the lion is afraid of the\r\nfire, as Homer also writes, \"The burning faggots which he fears when\r\nurged against him;\" and that he observes the person who strikes him\r\nand attacks him; and if a person aims a blow at him without hitting\r\nhim, the lion, if he can rush upon and seize him, does not do him any\r\ninjury, nor tear him with his claws, but shakes and frightens him,\r\nand then leaves him. They are more disposed to enter towns and attack\r\nmankind when they grow old; for old age renders them unable to hunt,\r\nfrom the disease which attacks their teeth. They live many years; and a\r\nlame lion has been captured which had many of its teeth broken, which\r\nsome persons considered as a sign that it had lived many years. For\r\nthis could not have happened except by the lapse of time.\r\n\r\n3. There are two kinds of lions. One of these has a round body and\r\nmore curly hair, and is a more cowardly animal. The other is of a\r\nlonger form, has straight hair, and is more courageous. Sometimes, when\r\nretreating, they stretch out their tails like dogs; and a lion has been\r\nat times observed, when about to attack a hog, to retreat when that\r\nanimal erected its bristles. The lion is weak if struck in the belly,\r\nbut will bear many blows on other parts of the body, and its head is\r\nvery strong. If they bite or tear anything, a large quantity of yellow\r\nserum flows from the wound, which can never be stopped by bandages or\r\nsponges. The mode of healing is the same as in the bite of a dog.\r\n\r\n4. The jackal is an animal attached to mankind. It does not injure men,\r\nnor is it much afraid of them, but it will fight with the dog and the\r\nlion. They are not, therefore, found in the same locality. The small\r\njackal is the best. Some persons say that there are two, others that\r\nthere are three sorts; but, like some fish, birds, and quadrupeds, the\r\njackal changes at different seasons, and has a different colour in\r\nsummer and in winter. In summer it is smooth; in winter, rough.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\n1. The bonassus is found in Pæonia, in Mount Messapius, which forms\r\nthe boundary between Pæonia and Mædia. The Pæonians call it monapus.\r\nIt is as large as a bull, and more heavily built; for it is not a long\r\nanimal, and its skin, when stretched out, will cover a couch for seven\r\npersons to recline upon. In form it resembles a bull, but it has a mane\r\nas far as the point of the shoulder like the horse, but its hair is\r\nsofter than that of the horse, and shorter. The colour of its hair is\r\nred. The hair is deep and thick as far down as the eyes, and in colour\r\nbetween ash-coloured and red, not like that of roan horses, but darker.\r\nIts hair below is like wool. They are never either very black or very\r\nred.\r\n\r\n2. Their voice is like that of the ox. Their horns are crooked and\r\nbent together, of no use for defence, a span long or a little more, so\r\nthick that each of them would hold half a measure or a little more.\r\nThe black part of their horn is good and smooth. The fore lock is so\r\nplaced between the eyes that the creature can look sideways better than\r\nforwards. Like the ox, it has no upper teeth in front, neither have\r\nany horned animals. Its legs are rough and its hoofs cloven. Its tail\r\nis small in proportion to its size, like that of the ox, and it tears\r\nup the ground and digs with its hoof like the bull. The skin upon its\r\nsides is strong. Its flesh is excellent food, and for this it is hunted.\r\n\r\n3. When wounded it retreats, and stays when it can proceed no farther.\r\nIt defends itself by kicking and ejecting its dung, which it can do\r\nto the distance of four fathoms from itself. It uses this means of\r\ndefence easily and frequently. Its dung is so caustic as to burn the\r\nhair from dogs. The dung is only caustic when the creature is disturbed\r\nand alarmed. It is not so when undisturbed. This is the form and nature\r\nof this creature. At the season of parturition they collect together\r\nin numbers in the mountains, and make a circle of their dung round\r\nthe place, as it were a fortification, for this animal ejects a large\r\nquantity of this excrement.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\nOf all wild animals the elephant is the most tame and gentle; for many\r\nof them are capable of instruction and intelligence, and they have\r\nbeen taught to worship the king. It is a very sensitive creature, and\r\nabounding in intellect. The male never again touches a female that he\r\nhas once impregnated. Some persons say that the elephant will live for\r\ntwo hundred years, others an hundred and twenty, and the female lives\r\nnearly as long as the male. They arrive at perfection when sixty years\r\nold. They bear winter and cold weather very badly. It is an animal\r\nthat lives in the neighbourhood of rivers, though not in them. It can\r\nalso walk through rivers, and will advance as long as it can keep its\r\nproboscis above the surface; for it blows and breathes through this\r\norgan, but it cannot swim on account of the weight of its body.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\nCamels refuse to have sexual intercourse with their dams, even when\r\nforced; for once a camel driver, who was in want of a male camel,\r\nveiled the dam and introduced her young to her. When the covering fell\r\noff in the act of copulation, he finished what he was about, and soon\r\nafterwards bit the camel driver to death. It is said also that the king\r\nof Scythia had an excellent mare, which always produced good colts. He\r\nwished to have a colt out of the mare by the best of these horses, and\r\nintroduced him for copulation, but he would not do it. When she was\r\ncovered up, however, he performed the act unwittingly. As soon as the\r\nform of the mare was shown after copulation, and the horse saw what was\r\ndone, he ran away and threw himself down a precipice.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\n1. Among marine animals there are many instances reported of the mild,\r\ngentle disposition of the dolphin, and of its love of its children,\r\nand its affection, in the neighbourhood of Tarentum, Caria, and other\r\nplaces. It is said that when a dolphin was captured and wounded on the\r\ncoast of Caria, so great a number came up to the harbour, that the\r\nfishermen let him go, when they all went away together. And one large\r\ndolphin, it is said, always follows the young ones, to take care of\r\nthem; and sometimes a herd of large and small dolphins has been seen\r\ntogether, and two of these having left appeared soon after, supporting\r\nand carrying on their back a small dead dolphin, that was ready to\r\nsink, as if in pity for it, that it might not be devoured by any other\r\nwild creature.\r\n\r\n2. Some incredible things are also told of their swiftness, for\r\nit appears to be the swiftest of all animals, whether marine or\r\nterrestrial. They will leap over the sails of large ships. This is\r\nespecially the case when they pursue a fish for the sake of food; for\r\ntheir hunger will make them pursue their prey into the depths of the\r\nsea, if it retreats to the bottom. And when they have to return from\r\na great depth, they hold their breath, as if they were reckoning the\r\ndistance, and then they gather themselves up, and dart forward like an\r\narrow, desirous of shortening their distance from a breathing-place.\r\nAnd if they meet with a ship they will throw themselves over its sails.\r\nDivers also do the same thing when they have sunk themselves into deep\r\nwater, for they also gather up their strength in order to rise to the\r\nsurface. The males and females live in pairs with each other. There is\r\nsome doubt as to the reason why they cast themselves on the land, for\r\nthey say that sometimes they appear to do this without any cause.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\n1. As the actions of all animals agree with their dispositions, so also\r\ntheir dispositions will change with their actions, and some of their\r\nparts also. This takes place among birds; for hens, when they have\r\nconquered the cock, desire to copulate with others, and their crest\r\nand rump become elevated, so that it is difficult to say whether they\r\nare hens or not. In some, also, small spurs are found; and some males,\r\nafter the death of the female, have been seen to take the same care\r\nof the young as the female would have done, leading them about and\r\nfeeding them, and neither crowing, nor desiring sexual intercourse. And\r\nsome male birds have been seen to be so effeminate from their birth,\r\nthat they neither crowed, nor desired sexual intercourse, and would\r\nsubmit themselves to any males that desired them.\r\n\r\n3. Many birds at particular seasons change both their colour and their\r\nvoice, as the blackbird, which becomes russet instead of black, and\r\nassumes another voice, for it sings in the summer time, but in winter\r\nit chatters and screams violently. The thrush also alters its colour,\r\nfor in winter it is grey, and in summer is variegated on the neck;\r\nbut its voice does not alter. The nightingale sings unceasingly for\r\nfifteen days and nights, when the mountains become thick with leaves.\r\nAs the summer advances it utters another voice, not quick and varied,\r\nbut simple; its colour also is altered, and in Italy it is called by\r\nanother name at this season of the year. It only shews itself for a\r\nshort time, for it lies concealed.\r\n\r\n3. The erithacus, and the bird called phœnicurus, are changed one\r\ninto the other. The erithacus is a winter bird, the phœnicurus a\r\nsummer bird; they differ in nothing but the colour. The sycalis and\r\nmelancoryphus are the same, for these also are interchanged. The\r\nsycalis is found in the autumn, and the melancoryphus immediately after\r\nthe end of the autumn. They also differ from each other in nothing but\r\ntheir colour and voice, and to prove that it is the same bird, each\r\nkind has been seen immediately after the change took place; and when\r\nthe change was not quite complete, there was nothing characteristic of\r\neither form. Nor is it absurd to suppose that these birds change their\r\nvoices or their colours, for the dove utters no sound in the winter,\r\nunless it may be on a fine day in a severe winter, when it will utter\r\nits sound to the astonishment of those that know its habits; and as\r\nsoon as spring commences, it begins to utter its voice: and, on the\r\nwhole, birds make the greatest number and variety of voices at the\r\nseason of coition.\r\n\r\n4. The cuckoo also changes its colour, and its voice is not distinct,\r\nwhen it is about to leave us. It goes away about the time when the\r\ndog-star rises, it having been with us from the commencement of spring\r\nto that time. The œnanthe, as it is called, disappears when Sirius\r\nrises, and comes again when it sets, for sometimes it retreats before\r\nthe cold, and sometimes before the heat. The hoopoe also changes its\r\ncolour and its forms, as Æschylus writes. \"He had variegated this\r\nhoopoe, the witness of its own evils, and has displayed the bold bird\r\nthat dwells in the rock in all armour. In the early spring it shakes\r\nthe feathers of the white hawk; for it has two forms, that of the\r\nyoung bird and of itself, from one origin. And when the young corn of\r\nthe harvest begins to grow, it is clothed in spotted feathers; and it\r\nalways hates this place of Pallene, and inhabits deserted forests and\r\nmountains.\"\r\n\r\n5. Some birds dust themselves, and others bathe. Some neither dust nor\r\nbathe. Those that do not fly, but live on the ground, dust themselves,\r\nas the domestic fowl, partridge, grouse, lark, and pheasant. Those\r\nbirds which have straight claws, and live near rivers, marshes, and the\r\nsea, bathe themselves. Some, like the pigeon and sparrow, both dust\r\nand bathe. Most of those with crooked claws do neither the one nor the\r\nother. This is their nature in these matters. The act of breaking wind\r\nbackwards is peculiar to some birds, as the turtle. Such birds make a\r\nstrong motion with their rumps when they utter their voice.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\n1. Animals not only change their forms and dispositions at particular\r\nages and seasons, but also when castrated. All animals that have\r\ntesticles may be castrated. Birds and oviparous quadrupeds have\r\ninternal testicles near their loins. In viviparous animals with feet,\r\nthey are generally external, though sometimes internal; in all they are\r\nsituated at the extremity of the abdomen. Birds are castrated near the\r\nrump, the part with which they touch the female in copulation, for if\r\nthey are burnt in that part two or three times with irons after they\r\nare full grown, the comb turns yellow, and they cease to crow, and no\r\nlonger desire sexual intercourse. If they are not full grown, these\r\nparts never reach perfection.\r\n\r\n2. The same is the case with the human subject, for if a boy is\r\ncastrated, the hair that is produced after birth never appears, nor\r\ndoes his voice change, but continues sharp; but if a full grown man is\r\ncastrated, all the hair produced after birth falls off except that on\r\nthe pubes, this becomes weaker, but still remains. The hair produced\r\nat birth does not fall off, for the eunuch never becomes bald. The\r\nvoice also of castrated animals changes to that of the female. Other\r\nanimals, if not castrated when young, are destroyed by the operation;\r\nwith the boar it makes no difference. All animals, if castrated when\r\nyoung, become larger and more graceful than those not castrated; but if\r\nalready grown, they never become any larger.\r\n\r\n8. If stags are castrated before they are old enough to have horns,\r\nthese never appear; but if castrated after they have horns, their size\r\nnever varies, nor are they subject to their annual change. Calves are\r\ncastrated at a year old, if not they become bad and inferior. The steer\r\nis castrated in this manner: they lay down the animal and cut the\r\nscrotum, and press out the testicles; they next contract the root of\r\nthe testicle as much as possible, and fill up the wound with hair in\r\norder that the discharge may escape, and if it inflames, they cauterize\r\nand sprinkle the scrotum. If adult bulls are castrated, they are still\r\napparently capable of sexual intercourse.\r\n\r\n4. The capria of the sow is also cut out, so that they should not\r\ndesire coition, but fatten rapidly. They are cut after fasting two\r\ndays. They hang them up by the hind legs and make an incision in the\r\nlower part of the belly, where the testicles of the male are generally\r\nfound; the capria is there formed upon the matrix, from which they cut\r\noff a portion, and sew up the wound again.\r\n\r\n5. The female camels also are cut when they wish to take them to war,\r\nthat they may not become pregnant. Some of those in the upper parts of\r\nAsia possess as many as three thousand. Such camels, when they run,\r\nare far more swift than the Nisæan horses, from the length of their\r\nstretch. And on the whole, castrated animals are longer-bodied than\r\nthose not castrated.\r\n\r\n6. All animals that ruminate, derive as much use and pleasure from\r\nrumination as from eating. Animals that have not cutting-teeth in both\r\njaws ruminate, as the ox, sheep, and goat. No observations have been\r\nmade on wild animals except those which occasionally associate with\r\nmen, as the stag, though this animal ruminates. They all lie down to\r\nruminate, and do so most in the winter; those which are brought up in\r\nshelter ruminate for nearly seven months. Those that live in herds,\r\nruminate for a shorter period, for they live out of doors. Some animals\r\nwith cutting teeth in both jaws, ruminate, as the Pontic mice and the\r\nfish, which, from this process, is called meryx. Animals with long legs\r\nhave loose bellies, and those with broad chests vomit more easily than\r\nothers, in quadrupeds, birds, and the generality of mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THE TENTH.\r\n\r\n(ERRONEOUSLY ASCRIBED TO ARISTOTLE.)\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nIf men and women, after they have reached a certain age, do not have\r\nchildren after cohabitation, the fault sometimes rests with both, and\r\nsometimes in only one of them. And first, it is requisite to examine\r\nthe uterus of the female, that if the fault lies there it may be\r\nrelieved by proper treatment. If the fault is not there, attention must\r\nbe paid to some other cause of sterility. We may conclude that this\r\norgan is in a healthy state, when, like the other parts of the body,\r\nit performs its functions without pain, and is free from fatigue after\r\nthe function is performed. Just as the eye is in a healthy state if it\r\nsuffers no pain in seeing, and is not disordered with the exercise of\r\nits function, or unable to perform it again, so the uterus is healthy\r\nwhich suffers no pain, and is well able to perform its functions,\r\nwhatever they may be, and after they are performed is not impotent, but\r\nis free from fatigue.\r\n\r\n2. The uterus is said to be disordered, when, even if it performs its\r\nfunctions properly and without pain, it does not hinder its function\r\nby any part of itself.[229] As there is nothing to prevent an eye\r\nfrom seeing accurately, although all its parts are not perfect, or if\r\nthere happens to be a tumour in it; so the uterus may have received no\r\ninjury in this respect, if it is properly situated in the right place.\r\nIn the first place, then, the healthy uterus will not be situated in\r\nthis place or in that, but will always be in a similar position; but\r\nit is not difficult to decide whether it is not placed at too great\r\na distance without suffering and pain, or whether it is devoid of\r\nsensation when touched. That these parts ought to be properly placed\r\nis evident from the following considerations, for if the uterus is\r\nnot near, it will not be able to imbibe the semen, for the place from\r\nwhich it ought to receive it will be at too great a distance. If the\r\nuterus is near, and not able to retire further, it will be useless, for\r\nit will be always touched so as to refuse to open; but it ought to do\r\nthis, and to be obedient to its function. These things ought to be thus\r\nordered, and if they are not, the case requires attention.\r\n\r\n[229] A corrupt passage.\r\n\r\n3. The catamenia also should proceed correctly, that is, if the general\r\nhealth is good, they should last for their proper time, and not\r\ncome irregularly, for when the catamenia are right, the uterus will\r\nopen properly, and receive the fluids of the body whenever they are\r\nsecreted; but when they make their appearance too often, or not often\r\nenough, or irregularly, while the rest of the body does not sympathise\r\nwith them, and the general health is good, we must look to the uterus\r\nfor the cause of their irregularity. The dullness of the uterus\r\nprevents its being opened at the proper time, so that it receives but\r\na small portion, or rather the uterus imbibes the fluid from some\r\ninflammation of the parts. So that it shows that it requires attention,\r\nlike the eyes, the bladder, the stomach, and other parts. For all the\r\nparts, when inflamed, imbibe the fluid which is secreted into each\r\nplace, but not such a fluid, or in so great quantities.\r\n\r\n4. In like manner, if the uterus secretes more than it ought to do,\r\nit exhibits an inflammatory tendency, if the secretion is regular\r\nbut too abundant; but if the secretion is irregular, or more putrid\r\nthan it should be in healthy subjects, the disease is then quite\r\nmanifest, for it is necessary that some pain should show that all is\r\nnot well. In a healthy subject, at the commencement, and the cessation\r\nof menstruation, the secretion appears white and putrid. All those\r\nsubjects in whom the secretion is more putrid than in healthy persons,\r\nor is irregular, or too abundant, or deficient, should receive\r\nattention, for this it is that prevents child-bearing. But in those\r\nsubjects who are only irregular, and unequal in the periods of the\r\nsecretion, the disease is not the preventive of child-bearing, though\r\nit shows that the habit of the uterus is changeable, and does not\r\nalways remain the same. And this affection is sufficient to prevent\r\nthose persons from conception who are otherwise well disposed towards\r\nit. It is, however, hardly a disease, but an affection which may be\r\nrestored without medical treatment, unless it is affected by some\r\nprevious fault.\r\n\r\n5. If the regularity and quantity of the discharge is subject to\r\nalteration, without any corresponding change in the rest of the body,\r\nwhich is sometimes in a more fluid, at other times in a more dry state,\r\nthe uterus is not in fault, though it ought to follow the habit of the\r\nrest of the body, and receive and secrete in proportion. If the body\r\nis in a good state of health, but undergoing a change, when this takes\r\nplace, and there is no need of medical treatment; but if the secretion\r\nis too small from disease, and the secretion is taken through some\r\nother source, the body suffers: and if the discharge is too great, from\r\nall the secretions of the body being turned in one direction, this does\r\nnot point to disease of the uterus, but of the whole body. Whenever the\r\ncatamenia coincide with the general habit of the body, it is evident\r\nthat the fault does not lie with the uterus, which would perform its\r\nfunctions properly if the general health were correct.\r\n\r\n6. Sometimes the uterus is weak, and sometimes strong; sometimes too\r\nfluid, and sometimes too dry; and the discharge coincides with the\r\nstate of the body, it is abundant when that is full, deficient when it\r\nis less full. If the body is full of fluid, the discharge is watery; if\r\nthe body is dry, it is more sanguineous; it begins with being white,\r\nlike milk, and is without smell. Some are dark-coloured, and when about\r\nto cease they become white, at the last secretion. The white discharge\r\nhas not the smell of putrid matter, but is more harsh and disagreeable,\r\nnor has it the smell of pus; and when this is the condition of the\r\nsymptoms, there is no wearing away, but the body becomes heated. In\r\nall that are in this state, the uterus is in a healthy condition for\r\nchild-bearing.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nWe must, then, first of all inquire whether all these particulars are\r\nwell ordered; and, next, we must learn the position of the body of the\r\nuterus; for it ought to be straight; and if it is not so, the seminal\r\nfluid can never reach it. And it is evident that women project their\r\nsemen forwards, from what happens when they have lascivious dreams; for\r\nthis part of them then requires attention, being moistened as though\r\nthey had sexual intercourse, for they also project into the place\r\nwhere the semen of the male is emitted, and not into the uterus; and\r\nwhen projected to this place, the semen is drawn into the uterus by\r\ninhalation, as the mucus is drawn into the nose. For this reason they\r\nbecome pregnant in every position; for the seminal fluid both in men\r\nand women is always projected forwards; but if it were projected into\r\nthe female she would not always conceive after copulation.\r\n\r\n2. But if the uterus is not straight, but inclined to the hips, the\r\nloins, or the hypogastric region, it is impossible to conceive, for the\r\nbefore-mentioned reason, that the uterus cannot take up the seminal\r\nfluid. If this deformity is great, either naturally or from disease,\r\nthe disorder is incurable. If there is a rupture, either by nature or\r\narising from the disease, which contracts the parts with inflammation,\r\nthe disorder will take a different turn from this. But in order that\r\nwomen may become pregnant, it is necessary, as it was said, that the\r\nmouth of the uterus should be straight and, moreover, should be well\r\nopened. By this I mean that when the menstrual discharge commences,\r\nthe os uteri should, on contact, appear softer than before, though not\r\ndistinctly expanded. But if this is the case, let the first appearance\r\nbe white.\r\n\r\n3. But when the appearances are more the colour of flesh, the uterus\r\nwill be evidently relaxed without pain when it is touched, and the os\r\nuteri is neither dull nor different from itself; and when the discharge\r\nceases, let the aperture be very open and dry, but not hard, for a\r\nday and a half or two days; for this shows that the uterus is in a\r\nhealthy state, and fit to perform its functions. If the os uteri is not\r\nimmediately relaxed, but appears soft, it shows that both the uterus\r\nand the rest of the body are relaxed, and the uterus does not prevent,\r\nbut first discharges the secretion from the os uteri. And when the\r\nrest of the body has discharged a great deal, and the os uteri becomes\r\nrelaxed, it is a sign of a healthy condition.\r\n\r\n4. And when the appearances cease to take place directly, the uterus\r\nshows that, if there is any difficulty, it will become empty and dry,\r\nand wanting in moisture, and there will be no remains in the passage.\r\nWhen the uterus, therefore, is capable of contraction, it shows that it\r\nis in a proper state for receiving whatever is brought to it, when it\r\nis in this state without pain, and indeed is insensate; and it is good\r\nthat the os uteri should not be in any other condition. This shows that\r\nthere is no reason why it should not close at the proper time. This\r\nis the manner of considering the os uteri, whether it is in a healthy\r\ncondition or not.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nThese ought to be the symptoms of the uterus itself after purification.\r\nFirst of all, that the woman should dream of sexual intercourse, and\r\nproject her seminal fluid readily, as if a man were lying with her;\r\nand if this symptom occur frequently, it is better. And when she has\r\narisen, sometimes she should require the same treatment as if she had\r\nbeen with a man, sometimes she should be dry; but this dryness should\r\nnot be immediate; but after awaking she should be fluid, sooner or\r\nlater, about as much as half a short day. The humidity should be of\r\nthe same kind as if she had been with a man. For all this shows that\r\nthe uterus is in a fit state to receive what is given it, and that the\r\ncotyledons are drawn up and will retain what they have received, and be\r\nunwilling to part with it.\r\n\r\n2. A flatulent state of the uterus is also a good sign, when it\r\nenlarges and discharges the wind as the bowels do without pain, and\r\nwhen it becomes larger and smaller without any symptom of disease; for\r\nthese symptoms show that the uterus is not in want of what is necessary\r\nnor sluggish, either naturally or from disease, but that it will be\r\nable to find room by growth for anything that it may receive, for it\r\nhas the power of dilation. When this is not the case, the uterus is too\r\nthick, or some natural defect or disease has rendered it insensible.\r\nFor this cause it cannot nourish, but it will destroy the embryo,\r\nif the symptoms are violent, while the embryo is small; if they are\r\nless so, when it is larger; if the uterus is slightly affected, the\r\noffspring will be inferior, as if it had been fed in an inferior vessel.\r\n\r\n3. Upon contact, the right and left side will be found to be alike,\r\nand all the other parts in the same way; and in the act of copulation\r\nmoisture will be produced, not frequently nor in great abundance. This\r\naffection is, as it were, a perspiration of the place, like the saliva,\r\nwhich is frequently produced both in the use of food and in speaking.\r\nTears also are shed from the eyes, when we look upon brilliant objects,\r\nand under cold or greater heat, of which these parts also partake,\r\nwhen they happen to be moist. So the uterus becomes moist when\r\nemployed, when it is of a more moist disposition. Those that are in the\r\nbest health suffer from this affection, for which reason women always\r\nrequire more or less attention, as also the mouth requires saliva. In\r\nsome this moisture is so abundant that they cannot imbibe the seminal\r\nfluid of the man in a state of purity, on account of its admixture with\r\nthis uterine moisture.\r\n\r\n4. Besides these affections, the following also is to be considered,\r\nwhether, when they dream of sexual intercourse, their general health is\r\ngood or not, as whether they are weak, and whether they are so always,\r\nor only sometimes, and whether they are not sometimes strong, and\r\nwhether they are dry at first and moist afterwards; for this ought to\r\nbe the condition of a woman capable of child-bearing; for relaxation\r\nshows that the body has been profuse of the seminal fluid, and that it\r\ncan perform its functions; but when the uterus is hard, it is a sign of\r\ndebility. If a woman has this affection without any disease, it shows\r\nthat the emission takes place naturally and as it ought to do. For if\r\nit were not so, there would be disease and prostration of strength.\r\nSometimes, when the uterus is dry and afterwards becomes moist, it is\r\na sign that the whole body receives and makes away with the seminal\r\nfluid, and that both the uterus and the body are strong; for it has\r\nbeen already observed that the uterus absorbs the semen which is placed\r\nupon it by the process of inhalation, for it is not emitted into it but\r\nupon the same place as that of the man. All that takes by inhalation\r\nis accompanied with force, so that it is plain that the body of such a\r\nperson must have the power of retraction.\r\n\r\n5. It sometimes happens that women who have lascivious dreams, or men\r\nof strong passions, are robust not from strength but from health. This\r\ntakes place when a large quantity of seminal fluid has been collected\r\nnear the place from whence they emit it. If this makes its escape, they\r\nare in no ways debilitated; for they are not relaxed by the loss of a\r\nportion, if sufficient remains behind, or if that which was emitted\r\nwas useless, nor if it was emitted easily, as if they parted with\r\nsuperfluous matter. For which reason such persons are not robust from\r\nstrength but from dullness. But when any part is emitted which is\r\nnecessary for the body, they become debilitated.\r\n\r\n6. If a person is in good health, and of a proper age, the seminal\r\nfluid is rapidly formed. This takes place in those that have not done\r\ngrowing and in those that are grown. Women rarely know when they are\r\nfirst pregnant; for they do not think that they have conceived unless\r\nthey perceive that the semen has been emitted, suspecting that it ought\r\nto be emitted at the same time both by the female and the male; and it\r\nescapes their notice, more especially when they think that they are\r\nunable to conceive, unless they have become dry, and that which they\r\nhave received has disappeared entirely; but it sometimes happens that\r\nboth the male and the female emit more than could possibly disappear,\r\nand more than enough for conception. When sufficient has been drawn in\r\nand much left out, they become pregnant without knowing it.\r\n\r\n7. That it is possible that this should take place, and that the\r\naffection does not arise from the whole of the seminal fluid, we may\r\nlearn from those animals which produce many young ones from a single\r\nact of intercourse, or from the case of twins produced by a single\r\nact. It is evident that they are not produced from the whole semen,\r\nbut each place receives some portion of it, but the larger portion\r\nis left behind; and if many young are produced from a single act of\r\nintercourse, which appears to be the case with swine and with twins,\r\nit is evident that the semen cannot come from every part of the body,\r\nbut it is divided out to each form. It is possible, therefore, that it\r\nmay be separated from every part of the body, and that the whole may\r\nbe divided among many, so that it is not possible that all should have\r\nevery part. The female also projects her semen into the os uteri, where\r\nthe man also emits his, when he approaches her. From thence she imbibes\r\nwith inhalation as if it were with the mouth or nostrils; for whatever\r\nis not joined to the members is either hollow above and united by a\r\nsymphysis, or is sucked in from this place by the act of inhalation.\r\nFor which reason they take care that it should be dry, as if this had\r\nhappened before.\r\n\r\n8. The path along which it passes is thus formed in women. There is a\r\ntube enclosed in the body like the penis of the male. The inhalation\r\ntakes place through this by a small passage above the passage for the\r\nurine. When, therefore, they desire sexual intercourse, this part is\r\nnot in the same condition as it was before. A falling down takes place\r\nfrom this passage, and the fore part of the uterus becomes much larger\r\nthan the part where it falls into this passage. This resembles the\r\nnostrils; for, as the nostrils have a passage into the pharynx and into\r\nthe external air, so this tube has a very small and narrow passage,\r\nlike a passage out for the wind. That to the fore part of the uterus\r\nis wide and broad, as the nostrils are to the external air between the\r\nmouth and the pharynx. So women have a larger passage to the fore part\r\nof the uterus, and wider than the external passage.\r\n\r\n9. Whatever conjecture is formed concerning these affections, it makes\r\nto the same conclusion, that the woman also emits a seminal fluid.\r\nThe same things arise from the same cause, for to some it seems to be\r\nthe cause of disease or of death; and these consider the end at the\r\nbeginning as it ought to be considered; for to some women these are\r\nimportant causes, to some of no importance; and of these causes some\r\nare and some are not of consequence. They divide also in proportion the\r\nconsequences which may result from them. To some it happens to pass\r\nthrough all these affections; to those who have many, through many of\r\nthem: others through few; and others, again, who have none, through\r\nnone of them.\r\n\r\n10. There are some persons who suffer from the affection called\r\ninflation. This ought not to be. The affection is of this kind. In\r\ncopulation they neither evidently emit semen, nor do they become\r\npregnant. Wherefore they are said to be inflated. The excessive dryness\r\nof the uterus is the cause of this complaint; and when it has drawn\r\nthe fluid into itself, it ejects it again. This becomes dried up, and\r\nhaving become small falls out, without any notice being taken of the\r\ncircumstance on account of its size. When the uterus is violently\r\naffected in this way, and becomes very dry, and ejects it very soon,\r\nit is plain that pregnancy cannot take place. If this does not take\r\nplace very soon, impregnation appears for a time to have taken place\r\nuntil it is ejected. The same thing also takes place at times in those\r\nwho have conceived properly; if a long time has elapsed, the uterus\r\nbecomes elevated, so that it plainly appears as if impregnation had\r\ntaken place until it falls out. Then all becomes as it was at first.\r\nThey refer this affliction to a divine origin. It is curable, unless\r\nit is natural, or the disease has gone a great way. It is a sign that\r\nthis disease is not present, when women appear neither to have emitted\r\nsemen, nor to have conceived after sexual intercourse.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n1. Pregnancy is prevented also by spasm in the uterus. This complaint\r\nattacks the uterus when it is either distended with inflammation,\r\nor in the act of parturition. When any large quantity of matter\r\nsuddenly enters it, and the os uteri is not open, spasm then arises\r\nfrom distension. It is a sign of the absence of spasm, if the uterus\r\ndoes not appear to reach inflammation in its functions: whereas, if\r\nspasm were present, there would be some signs of inflammation. Again,\r\na swelling at the mouth of the uterus, if it is much drawn out, will\r\nprevent conception. It is a sign that this is not the case, when the\r\nuterus appears to open and close properly after the discharge of the\r\ncatamenia, or the use of the male.\r\n\r\n2. In some, also, the os uteri is closed, either from the period\r\nof birth, or in consequence of disease. Sometimes this is curable,\r\nand sometimes not so. It is not, however, difficult to ascertain\r\nthe state of the case, for it is not possible either to receive or\r\nto emit anything in a proper manner. If it appears to have received\r\nand rejected the seminal fluid of the male, it is an evidence of the\r\npresence of the disease. But those who have no impediment in the way of\r\nconception, but are, as it has been said, as they ought to be, unless\r\nthe man is impotent, or they are not able to have children together,\r\nbeing unable to emit their semen at the same time, and differ very\r\nmuch, such persons will have no children.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand of sterility in the male, we must take other\r\nsymptoms. These will appear very easy, if he copulates with other\r\nwomen, and impregnates them. When the sexes do not appear to concur\r\nwith each other, although all the before-mentioned circumstances are\r\npresent, they do not have children together. For it is evident that\r\nthis is the only reason of sterility: for if the woman contributes\r\nto the semen and generation, it is evident that both the sexes should\r\nbe concurrent: for if the man is quick, and the woman slow, in the\r\nemission of the semen (and many women are comparatively slow), this\r\nwill prevent conception; for which cause they do not produce children\r\nby sexual union with each other. They do so, however, when they happen\r\nto be concurrent with each other; for if the woman is desirous, and\r\nprepared for the intercourse, and is inclined for it, but the man is\r\nsuffering previous pain, and of a cold disposition, it is then also\r\nnecessary that they should be concurrent.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nIt is quite plain when animals desire sexual intercourse; for the\r\nfemale pursues the male, as hens pursue the cock and place themselves\r\nbeneath him, if the male is not desirous. Other animals also do the\r\nsame. But if all animals appear to have these affections with respect\r\nto sexual intercourse, it is plain that the causes must be the same\r\nthroughout. This bird, however, has not only the desire of receiving,\r\nbut also of emitting semen. This is a proof of it. If the male is not\r\npresent, she will emit the semen into herself, and become pregnant, and\r\nproduce barren eggs, as if she desired both to emit semen, and when she\r\nhad done so, soon ceased, just as when the male was present. Others\r\nalso do the same, for a person has attempted to rear some singing\r\nlocusts, which he had taken in a young state. When grown, they became\r\npregnant spontaneously.\r\n\r\n2. From these considerations it is plain that every female contributes\r\nto the semen, if this appears to take place in any one class of\r\nanimals, for the barren animal differs in no respect from the other,\r\nexcept that it does not produce an animal, and this because it was\r\nformed by the union of both sexes. For this reason all the seminal\r\nfluid of the male does not appear to be productive, but some parts are\r\nbarren, when not properly compounded from both sexes. And when women\r\nhave lascivious dreams, the same affections of weakness and debility\r\noften occur, as if they had been lying with a male. It is plain,\r\ntherefore, that if they appear to have emitted a seminal fluid in\r\ntheir dream, they will then conjecture that after their dream the same\r\nplace will become moist, and they will be obliged to bestow the same\r\nattention upon themselves as if they had had sexual intercourse. So\r\nthat it is evident that there must be an emission of semen from both if\r\nit is to be productive.\r\n\r\n3. But the uterus does not emit its semen into itself, but on the\r\noutside, into the place where that of the male also is received, and\r\nthen draws it into itself. For some females produce spontaneously, as\r\nthe bird produces barren eggs, and other females do not so, as the\r\nhorses and sheep; either because the bird projects her semen into the\r\nuterus, and the place upon which that of the male is emitted is not\r\nexternal; for which reason, if he does not copulate properly with the\r\nfemale, it is poured out upon the ground. But in quadrupeds there is\r\nanother place for the reception of the semen, both of the male and\r\nfemale, which in other animals it is combined with other fluids of the\r\nbody, and is not collected in the uterus, because it does not enter it.\r\nBut in birds, the uterus receives and matures the seminal fluid, and\r\nforms a body similar in other respects though not a living creature.\r\nIt is necessary, therefore, the living creature should be derived from\r\nboth sexes.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nWe must enquire whether women speak the truth, when they say that\r\nafter a lascivious dream they find themselves dry; for it is plain\r\nthat the uterus draws upwards. And if so, why do not females become\r\npregnant spontaneously, since the male seminal fluid is drawn in, mixed\r\nwith their own? And why do not she goats draw that part of it which\r\nextends outwards? for this affection takes place in some that have\r\nbeen pregnant many years; for they produce what is called myle (an\r\namorphous mass of flesh), a circumstance which has also happened to a\r\ncertain woman; for having had sexual intercourse, and to all appearance\r\nconceived, the size of the uterus increased, and everything at first\r\nwent on regularly: but when the time of parturition arrived, she\r\nproduced nothing, nor did the enlargement become any smaller: but after\r\nthree or four years, a dysentery occurred, which placed her life in\r\ndanger, when she produced a large mass of flesh, which they call myle.\r\nThe affection continues in some to old age, even to the day of their\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n2. Does this affection arise from a warm habit of body, when the uterus\r\nis warm and dry, and for this reason capable of drawing into itself in\r\nsuch a manner that it is taken up and kept in it? For, in persons so\r\naffected, if the seminal fluid of both sexes is not united, but, like\r\nthe barren egg, is taken up by one sex, then the myle is produced,\r\nwhich is not living creature, for it does not originate in both sexes,\r\nnor is it lifeless, for it is taken to have life like the barren egg.\r\nIt remains, however, a long while, on account of the disposition of the\r\nuterus, and because the bird, which has produced many eggs in herself,\r\nwhen the uterus is stimulated by these, goes and lays them: and when\r\nthe first is produced, the last will also come forth in proper time:\r\nfor there is nothing to prevent it, but the body being productive as\r\nsoon as it is full, causes the uterus to be no longer retentive. But\r\nin viviparous animals, on account of the change of force, as the fœtus\r\nincreases, and the diversity of food is required, the uterus causes\r\nparturition from a kind of inflammation.\r\n\r\n3. But the flesh, because it is not alive, always requires the same\r\nkind of food, for it does not cause any weight in the uterus, nor any\r\ninflammation. So that the affection would continue, in some cases,\r\nthroughout life, unless some fortunate debility should take place, as\r\nin the woman who was attacked with dysentery. But does this affection\r\narise from warmth, as it was said, or rather from a fluid state,\r\nbecause there is a fulness as it closes, either because the uterus\r\nis neither cold enough to reject it, nor warm enough to bring it to\r\nmaturity? Wherefore, the disease lasts a long while, like those things\r\nwhich remain a long while before they are matured; but those that are\r\nabout to come to maturity have an end, and that quickly. Such uteri,\r\nbeing very high up, cause a long delay. And, again, not being alive,\r\nit does not cause any pain by its movements, for the movement of the\r\nligament which the living fœtus produces, causes pain. And the hardness\r\nof the substance is the effect of imperfect production, for it is so\r\nhard that it cannot be cut by the stroke of an axe. All ripe and mature\r\nthings become soft, but imperfectly digested things are immature and\r\nhard.\r\n\r\n4. Wherefore, many physicians, deceived by the resemblance, say that\r\nwomen are suffering from myle, if they only see the abdomen elevated\r\nwithout dropsy, and a cessation of the catamenia, when the disease has\r\nlasted for a long while. But this is not the case, for the myle is a\r\nrare disease. Sometimes there will be collections of cold and moist\r\nexcrements and fluids, and sometimes of thick ones in this part of the\r\nabdomen, if either the nature or the habit is of this kind. For these\r\nthings afford neither pain nor heat, on account of their cold nature;\r\nbut if they increase, more or less, they bring no other disease after\r\nthem, but remain quiet, like some maimed thing.\r\n\r\n5. The cessation of the catamenia takes place on account of the\r\nexcrementitious matter of the body being directed to this point, as\r\nwhen women are nursing; for they occur either not at all, or only in\r\nsmall quantities. A collection of matter from the flesh sometimes takes\r\nplace between the uterus and the stomach, which has the character\r\nof the myle, but is not it. But it is not difficult to know the\r\ndifference, by touching the uterus; for if it is correctly placed, and\r\nnot enlarged, it is evident that the disease is not there; but if it\r\nis the same as when with child, it will be warm, and cold, and dry,\r\nbecause all the fluids are turned inwards; and the os uteri will be in\r\nthe same condition as when they are pregnant; but if the enlargement is\r\nof any other kind, it will be cold, and not dry when touched, and the\r\nos uteri will always be the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n     ESSAY ON THE LITERARY AND PECUNIARY RESOURCES WHICH ARISTOTLE\r\n     EITHER USED, OR IS SAID TO HAVE USED IN THE EXAMINATION AND\r\n     COMPOSITION OF HIS HISTORY OF ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n              _Translated from the Latin of Schneider._\r\n\r\n\r\nAristotle had very likely more authorities, whom he has followed, or\r\nconverted to his own purposes, than those whose names he has given.\r\nThese are, however, a few, whom he has named, as Alcmæon of Crotona;\r\nDionysius of Apollonia; Herodorus of Heracleum in Pontus, the father\r\nof Bryson the sophist; Ctesias of Cnidos; Herodotus of Halicarnassus;\r\nSyennesis of Cyprus; Polybus; Democritus of Abdera; Anaxagoras of\r\nClazomene; Empedocles of Sicily; and if there are any more which do\r\nnot just now occur to my memory, they are accurately enumerated in the\r\nindex, with the names of the places to which they belonged. I have said\r\nthat it is probable, that Aristotle has derived information from more\r\nauthorities than he has named; and a reason for this conjecture is\r\nfound in a passage which he extracts, almost verbatim, from Herodotus,\r\non the Nilotic crocodile (Euterpe, 68). This I have shewn in a note on\r\nthe passage, book v. ch. 27, 2. And there are many places, both in his\r\nnatural history and his other works on animals, where our philosopher\r\nrefers to the ancient fables of men who were transformed into the\r\nnature and forms of various animals. The oldest author of such fables\r\nis Boeus (or Boeo, in the feminine gender, as some have conjectured).\r\nFrom this book Antoninus Literalis has extracted many chapters in\r\nGreek. Nicander of Colophon, and others, followed the example of\r\nBoeus. Among Latin writers, the Metamorphoses of Ovid have always\r\ncommanded attention. All who have read the work of Antoninus, and the\r\nMetamorphoses of Ovid, will easily perceive how much information on the\r\nnature and habits of animals our philosopher could have derived from\r\nthe very character of the books which had come down from the remotest\r\nantiquity to the time of Aristotle (compare note 9, 17, 1), especially\r\nif they bear in mind that the ancient teachers of physics always\r\ncompared the habits of animals with those of man, and conjectured the\r\ncauses and reasons of their actions, from similar impulses in man.\r\nThis may be seen in the fables of Æsop, for they contain the first\r\nelements of the doctrines of the ancients on physics and morals. We\r\nmight also offer a surmise on Eudoxus, and Scylax, and others, who\r\nwrote \"Travels Round the Earth,\" in which they described the animals\r\nof different countries; for our philosopher appeals to the testimony\r\nof both these authors, in his work on Meteorics, and elsewhere. There\r\nis more doubt whether Aristotle used, or could have used, the numerous\r\nnotices of animals, of the interior of Asia and India, which the\r\ncompanions of Alexander, in his Asiatic and Indian expeditions, brought\r\nback to Greece; which Theophrastus, the pupil of Aristotle, and his\r\nsuccessor in the schools, is found to have used so well in his History\r\nof Plants. For this I consider to be proved, that the written notices\r\nof the companions of Alexander were published after the death of the\r\nking, though we have no proof of the exact year in which they were\r\nmade public. Indeed I have never found any evidence in the History of\r\nAnimals which could lead us to suppose that Aristotle was acquainted\r\nwith the animals of the interior of Asia and India, by information\r\nderived from the companions of Alexander; nor have I been able to find\r\nthe slightest information from which I can form a conjecture as to\r\neither the place or time when this history was written: but, in order\r\nthat others may institute a more rigorous inquiry into the date and\r\nplace of its authorship, if any such have escaped my notice, I will\r\nplace before my readers that portion of the Aristotelian chronology\r\nwhich relates to this work, from the disputation of St. Croix, a\r\nlearned French author (Examen Critique des Historiens d'Alexander le\r\nGrand, p. 603, second edition). Aristotle, therefore, at the invitation\r\nof Philip, King of Macedon, undertook the education of his son,\r\nAlexander, when he was thirteen years of age, in the second year of\r\nthe 109th Olympiad, when Phythodotus was Archon of Athens. Aristotle\r\nreturned to Athens in the second year of the 111th Olympiad, in the\r\nArchonship of Evænetus. He taught at Athens for thirteen years, from\r\nwhence he fled to Chalcis, and there he died, in the third year of the\r\n114th Olympiad, during the Archonship of Philocles.\r\n\r\nThere is, indeed, a passage in Pliny, (book x. ch. 64, sect. 84, on the\r\nfecundity of mice,) where he says, that among other things Aristotle\r\nhas spoken in his History of Animals (vi. 29) of the gravid fœtus\r\nof the Persian mice; but the Greek exemplar contains no authority\r\nfrom which Pliny could have derived the words which he has added:\r\n\"More wonderful than all is the fœtus of the mice, which we cannot\r\nunhesitatingly receive, though derived from the authority of Aristotle,\r\nand the soldiers of Alexander the Great.\" In this and in two other\r\nplaces he calls those _soldiers_ whom others are in the habit of\r\ncalling the _companions_ of Alexander the Great. But there is also\r\na passage in the Meteorics of Aristotle (iii. 1), where he mentions\r\nas a recent event the destruction of the temple of Ephesus, by the\r\nincendiary Herostratus, on the day of Alexander's birth, in these\r\nwords: \"As it has just now happened in the burning of the temple of\r\nEphesus.\" This book, therefore, appears to have been written at the\r\ncommencement of the 106th Olympiad, and with it the History of Animals\r\nis very closely connected, as I have shown in my treatise on the order\r\nof the books of Physics; so that we may suppose that they were written\r\nin nearly the same Olympiad, if we regard only the series of the works;\r\nand no interruption occurred with which we are unacquainted. On the\r\nother hand, in the Meteorics (iii. 5), he speaks of a lunar rainbow,\r\nand says that it is rarely seen, and then adds, \"that it has occurred\r\nbut twice in more than fifty years.\" If we reckon these fifty years\r\nfrom the birth of Aristotle, in the first year of the 99th Olympiad,\r\nthat book will fall in the third or fourth year of the 111th Olympiad;\r\nand from this calculation it would follow that this book was also\r\nwritten in Athens, but that the first date is to be taken in a wider\r\nsense.\r\n\r\nFrom all this, we may easily perceive that at this day we are entirely\r\nignorant of the sources of information collected either from\r\nancient or contemporary writers, to which our philosopher had access\r\nin composing and completing a work of such multiplied and varied\r\ninformation. Even if we assume that they were as large as the mind\r\nof Aristotle was great, acute, and transparent, still, for a work so\r\nvarious and extensive, spread over seas, rivers, earth, and heaven,\r\neven that mind would require some assistance from other sources to\r\nwhich it might apply in constructing and building up a system of\r\ngeneral instruction from the materials collected in different places\r\nabout various animals, and from the observations used in describing and\r\narranging them together in orders, classes, genera, and species. The\r\nfollowing were the sources Aristotle used, according to the narrative\r\nof an uncertain author quoted by Pliny (viii. 16, 17)--\"King Alexander\r\nthe Great,\" he says, \"was possessed with the desire of knowing the\r\nnatures of animals, and therefore delegated the work to Aristotle, a\r\nman of very great learning. Some thousands of men in the whole region\r\nof Asia and Greece obeyed his commands, all, namely, who obtained their\r\nlivelihood by hunting, hawking, or fishing, or who had in their care\r\nmenageries, herds, beehives, fishponds, or aviaries; so that nothing in\r\nnature might be unknown to him; and from his examination of these, he\r\ncompiled those fifty celebrated volumes, which I have collected into\r\none, together with those animals with which he was unacquainted, and I\r\nhope that they will be consulted by good scholars.\" In all this there\r\nis nothing contradictory to the mind and liberality of Alexander, or\r\nthe confidence or strength of his empire. But some may prefer the story\r\npublished by Ælian, in his various history (iv. 19), who, I know not\r\non what authority, transfers the narrative to Philip, the father of\r\nAlexander--\"Having supplied abundance of riches to Aristotle, he was\r\nthe means of many other undertakings, and especially of his knowledge\r\nof living creatures; and the son of Nichomachus completed his history\r\nby the liberal assistance of Philip; who also honoured Plato and\r\nTheophrastus.\" If this be true, it evidently refers to those seven or\r\neight years in which Aristotle was in Macedonia presiding over the\r\neducation of Alexander, the son of Philip.\r\n\r\nThese abundant supplies for the studies of Aristotle are not at all\r\ninconsistent, either with the liberality of Philip, or his love for\r\nhis son and his son's tutor, nor do they surpass credibility. The gold\r\nmines of Philippi supplied the munificence and liberality of Philip.\r\nBut there are difficulties in the narrative which make us question the\r\ncredibility of the author of this munificence. For instance, the names\r\nof Plato and Theophrastus are mentioned; but the name of Theophrastus\r\ncould not be so great and illustrious, even if it were known to the\r\nGreeks at all, as to have attracted the liberality of Philip, before\r\nthe death of his master Aristotle, whom also he succeeded in the School\r\nat Athens. I should, therefore, rather imagine that Ælian, who was\r\nmore diligent in the accuracy of his Attic diction than his historical\r\nfidelity, has committed some error in the name of Philip, or in those\r\nof Plato and Theophrastus, whom he has appended to his narrative.\r\n\r\nThe narrative of Athenæus, (ix. 398,) derived from the report of an\r\nunknown author, is very different; he calls the History of Animals a\r\nvery expensive work, and then adds--\"There is a report that Aristotle\r\nreceived 800 talents from Alexander, for writing the History of\r\nAnimals\"--a sum of money which Perigonius, in his Notes on Ælian,\r\nestimates at 1,440,000 caroli. To this narrative, or, as it may be\r\nmore justly termed, rumour, is opposed the opinion of Io. Henr.\r\nSchulzius, in his History of Medicine (Leipsic, 1738, p. 358). \"When\r\nI consider this matter aright, it appears to me that the whole story\r\nis very doubtful, and, for the most part, fabulous. And it can easily\r\nbe proved, that the whole revenue of Macedon, if Alexander had paid it\r\nall to Aristotle for several years, would not have amounted to this\r\nsum. It is impossible, therefore, that he could have paid so much\r\nto Aristotle before the conquest of Asia; and after his expedition\r\nhad been successfully accomplished, his affection was alienated from\r\nAristotle, and, in order to annoy him, he liberally enriched other\r\nphilosophers, who had done nothing to deserve his patronage. Their\r\nlabours, therefore, are in vain, who demand justice of our excellent\r\nAristotle, even in his grave, because he did not use such an immense\r\nsum of money in the composition of a more veracious history.\r\n\r\n\"I am certainly of opinion that a great deal has been made, as\r\nusual, of a very little matter, namely, that if Aristotle derived\r\nany assistance in that kingdom, all the materials were provided for\r\nhim while Philip was alive, and before Alexander's expedition was\r\nundertaken, or in the first years of the expedition. But afterwards,\r\nwhen Alexander had set out, Aristotle returned to Athens, and was\r\nengaged in teaching: nor could he have derived any advantage from\r\nthe resources which Pliny mentions, and the multitude of persons who\r\nwere instructed to place themselves under his command, for he was not\r\nonly occupied with other pursuits, but would have been in danger of\r\nbeing destroyed by the fury of the Athenians, on the plea that he was\r\nattempting innovations, if he had even ventured to dissect animals, not\r\nto say men.\"\r\n\r\nIn a note he adds these observations:--\"Aristobulus, no unworthy\r\ncompanion of Alexander in his expedition, bears testimony, according to\r\nPlutarch, that the whole military chest did not contain seventy talents\r\nof coin. For the preparation of so arduous an undertaking, however, the\r\nsame person says, that two hundred talents ought to have been taken\r\nfor mutual exchange. I remember also to have read in Eustathius's\r\ncommentary on Homer, a very learned disquisition on the scarcity of\r\nmoney amongst the Macedonians, at the time of Alexander's expedition;\r\nbut I cannot lay my hands upon the passage.\"\r\n\r\nI must confess that I am not influenced by this annotation, nor does\r\nthe whole of this controversy appear to me to have been properly\r\nconducted. For the greatest doubt prevails as to the number of talents\r\nwhich Alexander is said to have paid to Aristotle, to help him in his\r\ntask; and the report only rests on the authority of a writer who lived\r\ncenturies after the death of Alexander. To refute this is useless\r\nlabour, both because its origin is obscure, and also because a sum of\r\nmoney set down in figures might be easily corrupted by transcribers.\r\nBut the testimony of Aristobulus will give little or no assistance to\r\nthe opinion of the learned, if we adopt that which is most probable,\r\nnamely, that Philip, or his son Alexander, gave large sums of money\r\nto Aristotle, to enable him to pursue his studies in Natural History,\r\nwhile he lived in Macedon, and was employed in the education of\r\nAlexander. The question about the date when Aristotle arranged and\r\npublished the materials and notes he had collected is quite distinct,\r\nand I do not think that it can be precisely ascertained at the present\r\ntime. The conjecture I have hazarded (light enough, I must confess)\r\ndoes not say much in favour of the story of abundant treasures supplied\r\nby Philip, or Alexander, to our philosopher, for the composition of his\r\nNatural History. But these persons form a very poor estimate of the\r\nstudy and labour bestowed by Aristotle upon the History of Animals,\r\nwho imagine that our philosopher had only access to such books as now\r\nremain, forgetting those of which time has robbed us.\r\n\r\nMost of all we must regret his Ζωϊκὰ, which appears to have given a\r\nmore accurate description of animals, and his ἀνατομικὰ, which further\r\ncontained notices of their internal structure, and was illustrated\r\nby drawings to which he often refers in his Natural History, as well\r\nas in his works on the parts and the generation of animals. It will\r\nscarcely be possible to fix with any accuracy on the number of books\r\nhe employed, after the great carelessness of librarians, and the many\r\nfacilities for error in copyists, arising from the method of notation\r\nby letters. Antigonus Carystius, in his sixty-sixth chapter, increases\r\nthe number of volumes given by Pliny, for he writes seventy; and if\r\nthe titles of the books, as they are given by Diogenes Laertius and\r\nAthenæus, are compared with those published, the number of books\r\nrelating to Animal History to which he may have had access are readily\r\nestimated, even should every book of every work be reckoned as a\r\nseparate book, and the list compared with the number given by Pliny.\r\n\r\nIn the memory of our fathers and grandfathers (for, alas! at the\r\npresent time few trouble themselves with the works of the ancients)\r\nthere were many who blamed Aristotle for these works, both for his\r\nmanner of treating the subjects and his narratives of the lives and\r\nhabits of animals, and vexed them with questions and disputations.\r\n\r\nThese objections will be better answered, when we come to those\r\npassages of the History. It may, however, be of some general avail to\r\nput a stop to these objections, which were urged against his manner of\r\nteaching; and I hope to be able to point out some peculiar sources from\r\nwhich Aristotle appears to have derived the more difficult parts of\r\nhis History, and those which were obnoxious to dispute.\r\n\r\nAmongst other foolish and trifling questions with which some\r\nGrammarian, in the Deipnosophistæ of Athenæus, (viii. p. 352,) has\r\nendeavoured not only to impugn, but even destroy our philosopher's\r\ncredibility, is the following:--\"I do not much admire the diligence of\r\nAristotle, though others praise him so highly. At what time, I should\r\nlike to know, or from what Proteus or Nereus ascending from the deep,\r\nto give him information, did he learn what the fishes were doing there,\r\nand in what manner they slept and took their food; for he writes things\r\nof this kind, which are only 'the miracles of fools,' as the comic poet\r\nsays.\"\r\n\r\nI will not follow the rest of his argument, which relates to\r\nterrestrial and winged animals; for the aquatic, and especially\r\nthe marine creatures, seem to offer the greatest opportunity for\r\nquestioning the fidelity of his narrative. In the first place, then, we\r\nmay observe, that of all mankind the Greeks were amongst the greatest\r\neaters of fish, at least after the heroic and Homeric ages; for Homer\r\nis never found to mention fish at the suppers and festivals of his\r\nheroes. So that I should not wonder if the frequent and repeated\r\nindustry and observation of fishermen, following their labours both in\r\nrivers and seas, to adorn the tables of their fellow citizens, supplied\r\nample and varied information to learned men who were engaged in the\r\ninvestigation of natural objects. By the same means they might learn\r\nfrom hunters the haunts and dispositions of wild beasts, and those of\r\ndomesticated animals from husbandmen. The whole life and labour of such\r\nmen was devoted to the uses, advantages, and food of man; and their\r\nobservations would be particularly directed to those animals which\r\ncould assist in sharing the labours of mankind, or whose flesh or other\r\nparts were required for food or medicine. Their parturition and its\r\nproper time, the number of their young, the manner of bringing them up,\r\ntheir nutriment, the pastures and food of the parents, and the proper\r\ntime for hunting them, were observed with the greatest accuracy. And\r\nif any diseases arising from the weather, their food, or their drink\r\nimpended over them, and threatened their production or the life of the\r\nwild cattle, or if a peculiar or common enemy laid in wait for the\r\nlife of one or all, it could not easily escape their observation; and\r\nfrom these circumstances we may manifestly derive the origin of those\r\nfables and narratives in which the opinions of animals are compared\r\nwith the life and manner of human beings, such as the simple minds\r\nof hunters, fishers, and rustics could comprehend. In these books of\r\nnatural history we find traces of many stories of this kind which it is\r\nunnecessary here to point out.\r\n\r\nIn the aquatic and marine orders of animals there is, besides these\r\nsources of information, the diligent investigation instituted by\r\ncertain writers throughout the seas and rivers of Greece, at a time\r\nwhen every useful fish, and marine and river animals of this class,\r\nmollusca, shell fish, and worms formed part of their food. The time and\r\nmanner of their coition, parturition, pregnancy, and life, the nature\r\nof their food, places and manner of taking fish, the times in which\r\nthey were not accessible, the faults and diseases of aquatic animals,\r\nwere minutely described. The twentieth chapter of the eighth book of\r\nour History is on this subject, where the food and diseases of aquatic\r\nanimals are described, and particular notice is taken of their use as\r\nfood, besides the observations on the manners of quadrupeds.\r\n\r\nIt is very evident that the life of one man would hardly suffice for\r\nthe observation of all these facts even in a single class of animals;\r\nbut, as I have said, there were writers before the time of Aristotle\r\nwho provided for the tastes and tables of these fish-eating Greeks a\r\nmost exquisite apparatus from the rivers and seas of Greece, especially\r\nin Sicily, which has been remarkable for its wealth ever since the\r\nreigns of Gelo and Hiero, and had surpassed the rest of Greece not only\r\nin its knowledge of nature, but in the art of poetry.\r\n\r\nThere is a passage in Plato's \"Gorgias,\" (sect. 156, p. 246, ed.\r\nHeind.) where mention is made of \"Mithæcus, the author of a work\r\non Sicilian cookery, and Sarambus, the publican. One furnished the\r\nbest of food, the other the best of wine.\" That the art of choosing\r\nand preparing food for the table was treated of in this book we may\r\nconclude from the use of the word ὁψοποιΐα, which the Greeks especially\r\nused to signify the kinds of fish used for food. A passage from this\r\nbook on the manner of cooking the fish called tenia is quoted by\r\nAthenæus, who makes the title of this book ὀψαρτυτικὸν, vii. p. 282,\r\nand xii. p. 506.\r\n\r\nWe cannot accurately ascertain the age of Mithæcus. The most ancient\r\nauthor of such a book that we can call to mind is Epicharmus, a\r\nSicilian poet and physician, from whose fragments, collected by\r\nAthenæus, we may certainly conclude he was acquainted with the nature\r\nof aquatic animals.\r\n\r\nTo this class we may, in the first place, refer those passages which\r\nare extracted from the drama called the Marriage of Hebe, or the\r\nMuses, and not only teach us the nature of fishes, but also the manner\r\nof procuring and cooking them. A learned writer in the \"Literary\r\nEphemeris\" of Jena, 1810, (Nos. 156, 157,) attempted to collect all\r\nthese and reduce them to order. There remain, however, many more\r\npassages which the conjectures of the most learned could hardly amend\r\nor explain, from the corruption of the text by librarians and the\r\nvariety of Sicilian names. And before the time of Epicharmus, Ananius,\r\nan Iambic poet, nearly contemporary with Hipponactus, an Ionian poet,\r\ncomposed, among other poems, a similar work on cooking fish, as we\r\nlearn from a passage extracted by Athenæus, (vii. p. 282.) After\r\nEpicharmus there was Terpsion, a Sicilian, who was the first to write\r\na gastrology, in which he taught his disciples from what kind of\r\nfood they ought to abstain. He is mentioned by Clearchus Solensis, a\r\ndisciple of Aristotle, in his work de Paræmiis, in \"Athenæus,\" (viii.\r\np. 337.)\r\n\r\nClearchus also mentions Archestratus, the Sicilian, the pupil of\r\nTerpsion, who, after having travelled through the whole of Greece,\r\nwrote a work in heroic verse on the nature of fishes, those especially\r\nwhich were fit for the table, and on the manner of cooking and\r\npreparing them. We learn that his book was called Ἡδυπάθεια, not only\r\nfrom the testimony of Athenæus, but from an imitation by Ennius. For\r\nEnnius, who died A.U.C. 584, one hundred and fifty-two years after\r\nthe death of Aristotle, translated and in part imitated the poem of\r\nArchestratus, and called his work \"Carmina Hedypathetica,\" as Apulegius\r\ntells us in his \"Apologia.\" We have good reason for supposing that\r\nArchestratus was either contemporary with Aristotle, or a little older.\r\nFor Archestratus mentions Diodorus Aspendius, the Pythagorean, as\r\nhis contemporary, to whom Timæus, the historian, tells us that the\r\nEpistle of Stratonicus was written (\"Athenæus,\" iv. p. 136). Therefore\r\nArchestratus, Diodorus, Aspendius, and Stratonicus, an eminent harpist,\r\nwere contemporaries, and so they were with Aristotle and Demosthenes;\r\nand this conjecture is confirmed by many passages in Athenæus, where\r\nStratonicus is reported to have been alive with those persons whom\r\nDemosthenes mentions in his orations. Aristotle, therefore, may have\r\nused this work of Archestratus in that part of his Natural History\r\nwhich treats of the nature of fishes.[230]\r\n\r\n[230] To the end of this Essay are appended fragments of Archestratus,\r\non the fishes of Sicily, amounting to 270 lines of heroic verse,\r\ntogether with notes, by the author of the Essay.\r\n\r\nThe writings of physicians who prescribed the food, both of sick and\r\nwell, have handed down similar and much more extensive observations\r\non the animals and fishes which were brought to the tables of the\r\nGreeks. Of this kind Athenæus has given many passages from Dorio, and\r\nDiphilus of Siphnus. Oribasius has made a long extract from the work\r\nof Xenocrates, on the aquatic animals used in food, which I purpose\r\nsome day to publish with Xenocrates, if my life should be spared long\r\nenough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Α.\r\n\r\n  Ἄγνος, Vitex agnus castus, a tree like a willow, the branches of which\r\n  the matrons strewed on their beds at the Thesmophoria, 266.\r\n\r\n  Ἀδριανικαὶ ἀλεκτορίδες, a small kind of domestic fowl, 138.\r\n\r\n  Ἀείσκωψ, a kind of owl.
