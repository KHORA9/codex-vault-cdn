Wilson Oliphant\r\n\r\n                                 1881\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTHE OPEN DOOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nI took the house of Brentwood on my return from India in 18--, for the\r\ntemporary accommodation of my family, until I could find a permanent\r\nhome for them. It had many advantages which made it peculiarly\r\nappropriate. It was within reach of Edinburgh; and my boy Roland, whose\r\neducation had been considerably neglected, could go in and out to\r\nschool; which was thought to be better for him than either leaving home\r\naltogether or staying there always with a tutor. The first of these\r\nexpedients would have seemed preferable to me; the second commended\r\nitself to his mother. The doctor, like a judicious man, took the midway\r\nbetween. “Put him on his pony, and let him ride into the High School\r\nevery morning; it will do him all the good in the world,” Dr. Simson\r\nsaid; “and when it is bad weather, there is the train.” His mother\r\naccepted this solution of the difficulty more easily than I could have\r\nhoped; and our pale-faced boy, who had never known anything more\r\ninvigorating than Simla, began to encounter the brisk breezes of the\r\nNorth in the subdued severity of the month of May. Before the time of\r\nthe vacation in July we had the satisfaction of seeing him begin to\r\nacquire something of the brown and ruddy complexion of his\r\nschoolfellows. The English system did not commend itself to Scotland in\r\nthese days. There was no little Eton at Fettes; nor do I think, if there\r\nhad been, that a genteel exotic of that class would have tempted either\r\nmy wife or me. The lad was doubly precious to us, being the only one\r\nleft us of many; and he was fragile in body, we believed, and deeply\r\nsensitive in mind. To keep him at home, and yet to send him to\r\nschool,--to combine the advantages of the two systems,--seemed to be\r\neverything that could be desired. The two girls also found at Brentwood\r\neverything they wanted. They were near enough to Edinburgh to have\r\nmasters and lessons as many as they required for completing that\r\nnever-ending education which the young people seem to require nowadays.\r\nTheir mother married me when she was younger than Agatha; and I should\r\nlike to see them improve upon their mother! I myself was then no more\r\nthan twenty-five,--an age at which I see the young fellows now groping\r\nabout them, with no notion what they are going to do with their lives.\r\nHowever; I suppose every generation has a conceit of itself which\r\nelevates it, in its own opinion, above that which comes after it.\r\n\r\nBrentwood stands on that fine and wealthy slope of country--one of the\r\nrichest in Scotland--which lies between the Pentland Hills and the\r\nFirth. In clear weather you could see the blue gleam--like a bent bow,\r\nembracing the wealthy fields and scattered houses--of the great estuary\r\non one side of you, and on the other the blue heights, not gigantic like\r\nthose we had been used to, but just high enough for all the glories of\r\nthe atmosphere, the play of clouds, and sweet reflections, which give to\r\na hilly country an interest and a charm which nothing else can emulate.\r\nEdinburgh--with its two lesser heights, the Castle and the Calton Hill,\r\nits spires and towers piercing through the smoke, and Arthur’s Seat lying\r\ncrouched behind, like a guardian no longer very needful, taking his\r\nrepose beside the well-beloved charge, which is now, so to speak, able to\r\ntake care of itself without him--lay at our right hand. From the lawn\r\nand drawing-room windows we could see all these varieties of landscape.\r\nThe color was sometimes a little chilly, but sometimes, also, as animated\r\nand full of vicissitude as a drama. I was never tired of it. Its color\r\nand freshness revived the eyes which had grown weary of arid plains and\r\nblazing skies. It was always cheery, and fresh, and full of repose.\r\n\r\nThe village of Brentwood lay almost under the house, on the other side of\r\nthe deep little ravine, down which a stream--which ought to have been a\r\nlovely, wild, and frolicsome little river--flowed between its rocks and\r\ntrees. The river, like so many in that district, had, however, in its\r\nearlier life been sacrificed to trade, and was grimy with paper-making.\r\nBut this did not affect our pleasure in it so much as I have known it to\r\naffect other streams. Perhaps our water was more rapid; perhaps less\r\nclogged with dirt and refuse. Our side of the dell was charmingly\r\n_accidenté_, and clothed with fine trees, through which various paths\r\nwound down to the river-side and to the village bridge which crossed the\r\nstream. The village lay in the hollow, and climbed, with very prosaic\r\nhouses, the other side. Village architecture does not flourish in\r\nScotland. The blue slates and the gray stone are sworn foes to the\r\npicturesque; and though I do not, for my own part, dislike the interior\r\nof an old-fashioned hewed and galleried church, with its little family\r\nsettlements on all sides, the square box outside, with its bit of a spire\r\nlike a handle to lift it by, is not an improvement to the landscape.\r\nStill a cluster of houses on differing elevations, with scraps of garden\r\ncoming in between, a hedgerow with clothes laid out to dry, the opening\r\nof a street with its rural sociability, the women at their doors, the\r\nslow wagon lumbering along, gives a centre to the landscape. It was\r\ncheerful to look at, and convenient in a hundred ways. Within ourselves\r\nwe had walks in plenty, the glen being always beautiful in all its\r\nphases, whether the woods were green in the spring or ruddy in the\r\nautumn. In the park which surrounded the house were the ruins of the\r\nformer mansion of Brentwood,--a much smaller and less important house\r\nthan the solid Georgian edifice which we inhabited. The ruins were\r\npicturesque, however, and gave importance to the place. Even we, who were\r\nbut temporary tenants, felt a vague pride in them, as if they somehow\r\nreflected a certain consequence upon ourselves. The old building had the\r\nremains of a tower,--an indistinguishable mass of mason-work,\r\nover-grown with ivy; and the shells of walls attached to this were half\r\nfilled up with soil. I had never examined it closely, I am ashamed to\r\nsay. There was a large room, or what had been a large room, with the\r\nlower part of the windows still existing, on the principal floor, and\r\nunderneath other windows, which were perfect, though half filled up with\r\nfallen soil, and waving with a wild growth of brambles and chance growths\r\nof all kinds. This was the oldest part of all. At a little distance were\r\nsome very commonplace and disjointed fragments of building, one of them\r\nsuggesting a certain pathos by its very commonness and the complete wreck\r\nwhich it showed. This was the end of a low gable, a bit of gray wall, all\r\nincrusted with lichens, in which was a common door-way. Probably it had\r\nbeen a servants’ entrance, a backdoor, or opening into what are called\r\n“the offices” in Scotland. No offices remained to be entered,--pantry and\r\nkitchen had all been swept out of being; but there stood the door-way\r\nopen and vacant, free to all the winds, to the rabbits, and every wild\r\ncreature. It struck my eye, the first time I went to Brentwood, like a\r\nmelancholy comment upon a life that was over. A door that led to\r\nnothing,--closed once, perhaps, with anxious care, bolted and guarded,\r\nnow void of any meaning. It impressed me, I remember, from the first; so\r\nperhaps it may be said that my mind was prepared to attach to it an\r\nimportance which nothing justified.\r\n\r\nThe summer was a very happy period of repose for us all. The warmth of\r\nIndian suns was still in our veins. It seemed to us that we could never\r\nhave enough of the greenness, the dewiness, the freshness of the northern\r\nlandscape. Even its mists were pleasant to us, taking all the fever out\r\nof us, and pouring in vigor and refreshment. In autumn we followed the\r\nfashion of the time, and went away for change which we did not in the\r\nleast require. It was when the family had settled down for the winter,\r\nwhen the days were short and dark, and the rigorous reign of frost upon\r\nus, that the incidents occurred which alone could justify me in intruding\r\nupon the world my private affairs. These incidents were, however, of so\r\ncurious a character, that I hope my inevitable references to my own\r\nfamily and pressing personal interests will meet with a general pardon.\r\n\r\nI was absent in London when these events began. In London an old Indian\r\nplunges back into the interests with which all his previous life has been\r\nassociated, and meets old friends at every step. I had been circulating\r\namong some half-dozen of these,--enjoying the return to my former life in\r\nshadow, though I had been so thankful in substance to throw it\r\naside,--and had missed some of my home letters, what with going down from\r\nFriday to Monday to old Benbow’s place in the country, and stopping on\r\nthe way back to dine and sleep at Sellar’s and to take a look into\r\nCross’s stables, which occupied another day. It is never safe to miss\r\none’s letters. In this transitory life, as the Prayer-book says, how can\r\none ever be certain what is going to happen? All was well at home. I knew\r\nexactly (I thought) what they would have to say to me: “The weather has\r\nbeen so fine, that Roland has not once gone by train, and he enjoys the\r\nride beyond anything.” “Dear papa, be sure that you don’t forget\r\nanything, but bring us so-and-so, and so-and-so,”--a list as long as my\r\narm. Dear girls and dearer mother! I would not for the world have\r\nforgotten their commissions, or lost their little letters, for all the\r\nBenbows and Crosses in the world.\r\n\r\nBut I was confident in my home-comfort and peacefulness. When I got back\r\nto my club, however, three or four letters were lying for one, upon some\r\nof which I noticed the “immediate,” “urgent,” which old-fashioned people\r\nand anxious people still believe will influence the post-office and\r\nquicken the speed of the mails. I was about to open one of these, when\r\nthe club porter brought me two telegrams, one of which, he said, had\r\narrived the night before. I opened, as was to be expected, the last\r\nfirst, and this was what I read: “Why don’t you come or answer? For God’s\r\nsake, come. He is much worse.” This was a thunderbolt to fall upon a\r\nman’s head who had one only son, and he the light of his eyes! The other\r\ntelegram, which I opened with hands trembling so much that I lost time by\r\nmy haste, was to much the same purport: “No better; doctor afraid of\r\nbrain-fever. Calls for you day and night. Let nothing detain you.” The\r\nfirst thing I did was to look up the time-tables to see if there was any\r\nway of getting off sooner than by the night-train, though I knew well\r\nenough there was not; and then I read the letters, which furnished, alas!\r\ntoo clearly, all the details. They told me that the boy had been pale for\r\nsome time, with a scared look. His mother had noticed it before I left\r\nhome, but would not say anything to alarm me. This look had increased day\r\nby day: and soon it was observed that Roland came home at a wild gallop\r\nthrough the park, his pony panting and in foam, himself “as white as a\r\nsheet,” but with the perspiration streaming from his forehead. For a long\r\ntime he had resisted all questioning, but at length had developed such\r\nstrange changes of mood, showing a reluctance to go to school, a desire\r\nto be fetched in the carriage at night,--which was a ridiculous piece of\r\nluxury,--an unwillingness to go out into the grounds, and nervous start\r\nat every sound, that his mother had insisted upon an explanation. When\r\nthe boy--our boy Roland, who had never known what fear was--began to talk\r\nto her of voices he had heard in the park, and shadows that had appeared\r\nto him among the ruins, my wife promptly put him to bed and sent for Dr.\r\nSimson, which, of course, was the only thing to do.\r\n\r\nI hurried off that evening, as may be supposed, with an anxious heart.\r\nHow I got through the hours before the starting of the train, I cannot\r\ntell. We must all be thankful for the quickness of the railway when in\r\nanxiety; but to have thrown myself into a post-chaise as soon as horses\r\ncould be put to, would have been a relief. I got to Edinburgh very early\r\nin the blackness of the winter morning, and scarcely dared look the man\r\nin the face, at whom I gasped, “What news?” My wife had sent the\r\nbrougham for me, which I concluded, before the man spoke, was a bad sign.\r\nHis answer was that stereotyped answer which leaves the imagination so\r\nwildly free,--“Just the same.” Just the same! What might that mean? The\r\nhorses seemed to me to creep along the long dark country road. As we\r\ndashed through the park, I thought I heard some one moaning among the\r\ntrees, and clenched my fist at him (whoever he might be) with fury. Why\r\nhad the fool of a woman at the gate allowed any one to come in to disturb\r\nthe quiet of the place? If I had not been in such hot haste to get home,\r\nI think I should have stopped the carriage and got out to see what tramp\r\nit was that had made an entrance, and chosen my grounds, of all places in\r\nthe world,--when my boy was ill!--to grumble and groan in. But I had no\r\nreason to complain of our slow pace here. The horses flew like lightning\r\nalong the intervening path, and drew up at the door all panting, as if\r\nthey had run a race. My wife stood waiting to receive me, with a pale\r\nface, and a candle in her hand, which made her look paler still as the\r\nwind blew the flame about. “He is sleeping,” she said in a whisper, as if\r\nher voice might wake him. And I replied, when I could find my voice, also\r\nin a whisper, as though the jingling of the horses’ furniture and the\r\nsound of their hoofs must not have been more dangerous. I stood on the\r\nsteps with her a moment, almost afraid to go in, now that I was here; and\r\nit seemed to me that I saw without observing, if I may say so, that the\r\nhorses were unwilling to turn round, though their stables lay that way,\r\nor that the men were unwilling. These things occurred to me afterwards,\r\nthough at the moment I was not capable of anything but to ask questions\r\nand to hear of the condition of the boy.\r\n\r\nI looked at him from the door of his room, for we were afraid to go near,\r\nlest we should disturb that blessed sleep. It looked like actual sleep,\r\nnot the lethargy into which my wife told me he would sometimes fall. She\r\ntold me everything in the next room, which communicated with his, rising\r\nnow and then and going to the door of communication; and in this there\r\nwas much that was very startling and confusing to the mind. It appeared\r\nthat ever since the winter began--since it was early dark, and night had\r\nfallen before his return from school--he had been hearing voices among\r\nthe ruins: at first only a groaning, he said, at which his pony was as\r\nmuch alarmed as he was, but by degrees a voice. The tears ran down my\r\nwife’s cheeks as she described to me how he would start up in the night\r\nand cry out, “Oh, mother, let me in! oh, mother, let me in!” with a\r\npathos which rent her heart. And she sitting there all the time, only\r\nlonging to do everything his heart could desire! But though she would try\r\nto soothe him, crying, “You are at home, my darling. I am here. Don’t you\r\nknow me? Your mother is here!” he would only stare at her, and after a\r\nwhile spring up again with the same cry. At other times he would be quite\r\nreasonable, she said, asking eagerly when I was coming, but declaring\r\nthat he must go with me as soon as I did so, “to let them in.” “The\r\ndoctor thinks his nervous system must have received a shock,” my wife\r\nsaid. “Oh, Henry, can it be that we have pushed him on too much with his\r\nwork--a delicate boy like Roland? And what is his work in comparison with\r\nhis health? Even you would think little of honors or prizes if it hurt\r\nthe boy’s health.” Even I!--as if I were an inhuman father sacrificing my\r\nchild to my ambition. But I would not increase her trouble by taking any\r\nnotice. After awhile they persuaded me to lie down, to rest, and to eat,\r\nnone of which things had been possible since I received their letters.\r\nThe mere fact of being on the spot, of course, in itself was a great\r\nthing; and when I knew that I could be called in a moment, as soon as he\r\nwas awake and wanted me, I felt capable, even in the dark, chill morning\r\ntwilight, to snatch an hour or two’s sleep. As it happened, I was so\r\nworn out with the strain of anxiety, and he so quieted and consoled by\r\nknowing I had come, that I was not disturbed till the afternoon, when the\r\ntwilight had again settled down. There was just daylight enough to see\r\nhis face when I went to him; and what a change in a fortnight! He was\r\npaler and more worn, I thought, than even in those dreadful days in the\r\nplains before we left India. His hair seemed to me to have grown long and\r\nlank; his eyes were like blazing lights projecting out of his white face.\r\nHe got hold of my hand in a cold and tremulous clutch, and waved to\r\neverybody to go away. “Go away--even mother,” he said; “go away.” This\r\nwent to her heart; for she did not like that even I should have more of\r\nthe boy’s confidence than herself; but my wife has never been a woman to\r\nthink of herself, and she left us alone. “Are they all gone?” he said\r\neagerly. “They would not let me speak. The doctor treated me as if I were\r\na fool. You know I am not a fool, papa.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, my boy, I know. But you are ill, and quiet is so necessary.\r\nYou are not only not a fool, Roland, but you are reasonable and\r\nunderstand. When you are ill you must deny yourself; you must not do\r\neverything that you might do being well.”\r\n\r\nHe waved his thin hand with a sort of indignation. “Then, father, I am\r\nnot ill,” he cried. “Oh, I thought when you came you would not stop\r\nme,--you would see the sense of it! What do you think is the matter with\r\nme, all of you? Simson is well enough; but he is only a doctor. What do\r\nyou think is the matter with me? I am no more ill than you are. A doctor,\r\nof course, he thinks you are ill the moment he looks at you--that’s what\r\nhe’s there for--and claps you into bed.”\r\n\r\n“Which is the best place for you at present, my dear boy.”\r\n\r\n“I made up my mind,” cried the little fellow, “that I would stand it till\r\nyou came home. I said to myself, I won’t frighten mother and the girls.\r\nBut now, father,” he cried, half jumping out of bed, “it’s not illness:\r\nit’s a secret.”\r\n\r\nHis eyes shone so wildly, his face was so swept with strong feeling, that\r\nmy heart sank within me. It could be nothing but fever that did it, and\r\nfever had been so fatal. I got him into my arms to put him back into\r\nbed. “Roland,” I said, humoring the poor child, which I knew was the\r\nonly way, “if you are going to tell me this secret to do any good, you\r\nknow you must be quite quiet, and not excite yourself. If you excite\r\nyourself, I must not let you speak.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, father,” said the boy. He was quiet directly, like a man, as if he\r\nquite understood. When I had laid him back on his pillow, he looked up at\r\nme with that grateful, sweet look with which children, when they are ill,\r\nbreak one’s heart, the water coming into his eyes in his weakness. “I was\r\nsure as soon as you were here you would know what to do,” he said.\r\n\r\n“To be sure, my boy. Now keep quiet, and tell it all out like a man.” To\r\nthink I was telling lies to my own child! for I did it only to humor him,\r\nthinking, poor little fellow, his brain was wrong.\r\n\r\n“Yes, father. Father, there is some one in the park--some one that has\r\nbeen badly used.”\r\n\r\n“Hush, my dear; you remember there is to be no excitement. Well, who\r\nis this somebody, and who has been ill-using him? We will soon put\r\na stop to that.”\r\n\r\n“All,” cried Roland, “but it is not so easy as you think. I don’t know\r\nwho it is. It is just a cry. Oh, if you could hear it! It gets into my\r\nhead in my sleep. I heard it as clear--as clear; and they think that I\r\nam dreaming, or raving perhaps,” the boy said, with a sort of\r\ndisdainful smile.\r\n\r\nThis look of his perplexed me; it was less like fever than I thought.\r\n“Are you quite sure you have not dreamed it, Roland?” I said.\r\n\r\n“Dreamed?--that!” He was springing up again when he suddenly bethought\r\nhimself, and lay down flat, with the same sort of smile on his face. “The\r\npony heard it, too,” he said. “She jumped as if she had been shot. If I\r\nhad not grasped at the reins--for I was frightened, father--”\r\n\r\n“No shame to you, my boy,” said I, though I scarcely knew why.\r\n\r\n“If I hadn’t held to her like a leech, she’d have pitched me over her\r\nhead, and never drew breath till we were at the door. Did the pony dream\r\nit?” he said, with a soft disdain, yet indulgence for my foolishness.\r\nThen he added slowly, “It was only a cry the first time, and all the\r\ntime before you went away. I wouldn’t tell you, for it was so wretched\r\nto be frightened. I thought it might be a hare or a rabbit snared, and I\r\nwent in the morning and looked; but there was nothing. It was after you\r\nwent I heard it really first; and this is what he says.” He raised\r\nhimself on his elbow close to me, and looked me in the face: “‘Oh,\r\nmother, let me in! oh, mother, let me in!’” As he said the words a mist\r\ncame over his face, the mouth quivered, the soft features all melted and\r\nchanged, and when he had ended these pitiful words, dissolved in a\r\nshower of heavy tears.\r\n\r\nWas it a hallucination? Was it the fever of the brain? Was it the\r\ndisordered fancy caused by great bodily weakness? How could I tell? I\r\nthought it wisest to accept it as if it were all true.\r\n\r\n“This is very touching, Roland,” I said.\r\n\r\n“Oh, if you had just heard it, father! I said to myself, if father heard\r\nit he would do something; but mamma, you know, she’s given over to\r\nSimson, and that fellow’s a doctor, and never thinks of anything but\r\nclapping you into bed.”\r\n\r\n“We must not blame Simson for being a doctor, Roland.”\r\n\r\n“No, no,” said my boy, with delightful toleration and indulgence; “oh,\r\nno; that’s the good of him; that’s what he’s for; I know that. But\r\nyou--you are different; you are just father; and you’ll do\r\nsomething--directly, papa, directly; this very night.”\r\n\r\n“Surely,” I said. “No doubt it is some little lost child.”\r\n\r\nHe gave me a sudden, swift look, investigating my face as though to see\r\nwhether, after all, this was everything my eminence as “father” came\r\nto,--no more than that. Then he got hold of my shoulder, clutching it\r\nwith his thin hand. “Look here,” he said, with a quiver in his voice;\r\n“suppose it wasn’t--living at all!”\r\n\r\n“My dear boy, how then could you have heard it?” I said.\r\n\r\nHe turned away from me with a pettish exclamation,--“As if you didn’t\r\nknow better than that!”\r\n\r\n“Do you want to tell me it is a ghost?” I said.\r\n\r\nRoland withdrew his hand; his countenance assumed an aspect of great\r\ndignity and gravity; a slight quiver remained about his lips. “Whatever\r\nit was--you always said we were not to call names. It was something--in\r\ntrouble. Oh, father, in terrible trouble!”\r\n\r\n“But, my boy,” I said (I was at my wits’ end), “if it was a child\r\nthat was lost, or any poor human creature--but, Roland, what do you\r\nwant me to do?”\r\n\r\n“I should know if I was you,” said the child eagerly. “That is what I\r\nalways said to myself,--Father will know. Oh, papa, papa, to have to\r\nface it night after night, in such terrible, terrible trouble, and never\r\nto be able to do it any good! I don’t want to cry; it’s like a baby, I\r\nknow; but what can I do else? Out there all by itself in the ruin, and\r\nnobody to help it! I can’t bear it! I can’t bear it!” cried my generous\r\nboy. And in his weakness he burst out, after many attempts to restrain\r\nit, into a great childish fit of sobbing and tears.\r\n\r\nI do not know that I ever was in a greater perplexity, in my life; and\r\nafterwards, when I thought of it, there was something comic in it too. It\r\nis bad enough to find your child’s mind possessed with the conviction\r\nthat he has seen, or heard, a ghost; but that he should require you to go\r\ninstantly and help that ghost was the most bewildering experience that\r\nhad ever come my way. I am a sober man myself, and not superstitious--at\r\nleast any more than everybody is superstitious. Of course I do not\r\nbelieve in ghosts; but I don’t deny, any more than other people, that\r\nthere are stories which I cannot pretend to understand. My blood got a\r\nsort of chill in my veins at the idea that Roland should be a ghost-seer;\r\nfor that generally means a hysterical temperament and weak health, and\r\nall that men most hate and fear for their children. But that I should\r\ntake up his ghost and right its wrongs, and save it from its trouble, was\r\nsuch a mission as was enough to confuse any man. I did my best to console\r\nmy boy without giving any promise of this astonishing kind; but he was\r\ntoo sharp for me: he would have none of my caresses. With sobs breaking\r\nin at intervals upon his voice, and the rain-drops hanging on his\r\neyelids, he yet returned to the charge.\r\n\r\n“It will be there now!--it will be there all the night! Oh, think,\r\npapa,--think if it was me! I can’t rest for thinking of it. Don’t!” he\r\ncried, putting away my hand,--“don’t! You go and help it, and mother can\r\ntake care of me.”\r\n\r\n“But, Roland, what can I do?”\r\n\r\nMy boy opened his eyes, which were large with weakness and fever, and\r\ngave me a smile such, I think, as sick children only know the secret of.\r\n“I was sure you would know as soon as you came. I always said, Father\r\nwill know. And mother,” he cried, with a softening of repose upon his\r\nface, his limbs relaxing, his form sinking with a luxurious ease in his\r\nbed,--“mother can come and take care of me.”\r\n\r\nI called her, and saw him turn to her with the complete dependence of a\r\nchild; and then I went away and left them, as perplexed a man as any in\r\nScotland. I must say, however, I had this consolation, that my mind was\r\ngreatly eased about Roland. He might be under a hallucination; but his\r\nhead was clear enough, and I did not think him so ill as everybody else\r\ndid. The girls were astonished even at the ease with which I took it.\r\n“How do you think he is?” they said in a breath, coming round me, laying\r\nhold of me. “Not half so ill as I expected,” I said; “not very bad at\r\nall.” “Oh, papa, you are a darling!” cried Agatha, kissing me, and crying\r\nupon my shoulder; while little Jeanie, who was as pale as Roland, clasped\r\nboth her arms round mine, and could not speak at all. I knew nothing\r\nabout it, not half so much as Simson; but they believed in me: they had a\r\nfeeling that all would go right now. God is very good to you when your\r\nchildren look to you like that. It makes one humble, not proud. I was not\r\nworthy of it; and then I recollected that I had to act the part of a\r\nfather to Roland’s ghost,--which made me almost laugh, though I might\r\njust as well have cried. It was the strangest mission that ever was\r\nintrusted to mortal man.\r\n\r\nIt was then I remembered suddenly the looks of the men when they turned\r\nto take the brougham to the stables in the dark that morning. They had\r\nnot liked it, and the horses had not liked it. I remembered that even in\r\nmy anxiety about Roland I had heard them tearing along the avenue back to\r\nthe stables, and had made a memorandum mentally that I must speak of it.\r\nIt seemed to me that the best thing I could do was to go to the stables\r\nnow and make a few inquiries. It is impossible to fathom the minds of\r\nrustics; there might be some devilry of practical joking, for anything I\r\nknew; or they might have some interest in getting up a bad reputation for\r\nthe Brentwood avenue. It was getting dark by the time I went out, and\r\nnobody who knows the country will need to be told how black is the\r\ndarkness of a November night under high laurel-bushes and yew-trees. I\r\nwalked into the heart of the shrubberies two or three times, not seeing a\r\nstep before me, till I came out upon the broader carriage-road, where the\r\ntrees opened a little, and there was a faint gray glimmer of sky visible,\r\nunder which the great limes and elms stood darkling like ghosts; but it\r\ngrew black again as I approached the corner where the ruins lay. Both\r\neyes and ears were on the alert, as may be supposed; but I could see\r\nnothing in the absolute gloom, and, so far as I can recollect, I heard\r\nnothing. Nevertheless there came a strong impression upon me that\r\nsomebody was there. It is a sensation which most people have felt. I have\r\nseen when it has been strong enough to awake me out of sleep, the sense\r\nof some one looking at me. I suppose my imagination had been affected by\r\nRoland’s story; and the mystery of the darkness is always full of\r\nsuggestions. I stamped my feet violently on the gravel to rouse myself,\r\nand called out sharply, “Who’s there?” Nobody answered, nor did I expect\r\nany one to answer, but the impression had been made. I was so foolish\r\nthat I did not like to look back, but went sideways, keeping an eye on\r\nthe gloom behind. It was with great relief that I spied the light in the\r\nstables, making a sort of oasis in the darkness. I walked very quickly\r\ninto the midst of that lighted and cheerful place, and thought the clank\r\nof the groom’s pail one of the pleasantest sounds I had ever heard. The\r\ncoachman was the head of this little colony, and it was to his house I\r\nwent to pursue my investigations. He was a native of the district, and\r\nhad taken care of the place in the absence of the family for years; it\r\nwas impossible but that he must know everything that was going on, and\r\nall the traditions of the place. The men, I could see, eyed me anxiously\r\nwhen I thus appeared at such an hour among them, and followed me with\r\ntheir eyes to Jarvis’s house, where he lived alone with his old wife,\r\ntheir children being all married and out in the world. Mrs. Jarvis met me\r\nwith anxious questions. How was the poor young gentleman? But the others\r\nknew, I could see by their faces, that not even this was the foremost\r\nthing in my mind.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Noises?--ou ay, there’ll be noises,--the wind in the trees, and the\r\nwater soughing down the glen. As for tramps, Cornel, no, there’s little\r\no’ that kind o’ cattle about here; and Merran at the gate’s a careful\r\nbody.” Jarvis moved about with some embarrassment from one leg to\r\nanother as he spoke. He kept in the shade, and did not look at me more\r\nthan he could help. Evidently his mind was perturbed, and he had\r\nreasons for keeping his own counsel. His wife sat by, giving him a quick\r\nlook now and then, but saying nothing. The kitchen was very snug and\r\nwarm and bright,--as different as could be from the chill and mystery of\r\nthe night outside.\r\n\r\n“I think you are trifling with me, Jarvis,” I said.\r\n\r\n“Triflin’, Cornel? No me. What would I trifle for? If the deevil himsel\r\nwas in the auld hoose, I have no interest in ’t one way or another--”\r\n\r\n“Sandy, hold your peace!” cried his wife imperatively.\r\n\r\n“And what am I to hold my peace for, wi’ the Cornel standing there asking\r\na’ thae questions? I’m saying, if the deevil himsel--”\r\n\r\n“And I’m telling ye hold your peace!” cried the woman, in great\r\nexcitement. “Dark November weather and lang nichts, and us that ken a’ we\r\nken. How daur ye name--a name that shouldna be spoken?” She threw down\r\nher stocking and got up, also in great agitation. “I tellt ye you never\r\ncould keep it. It’s no a thing that will hide, and the haill toun kens as\r\nweel as you or me. Tell the Cornel straight out--or see, I’ll do it. I\r\ndinna hold wi’ your secrets, and a secret that the haill toun kens!” She\r\nsnapped her fingers with an air of large disdain. As for Jarvis, ruddy\r\nand big as he was, he shrank to nothing before this decided woman. He\r\nrepeated to her two or three times her own adjuration, “Hold your peace!”\r\nthen, suddenly changing his tone, cried out, “Tell him then, confound\r\nye! I’ll wash my hands o’t. If a’ the ghosts in Scotland were in the auld\r\nhoose, is that ony concern o’ mine?”\r\n\r\nAfter this I elicited without much difficulty the whole story. In the\r\nopinion of the Jarvises, and of everybody about, the certainty that the\r\nplace was haunted was beyond all doubt. As Sandy and his wife warmed to\r\nthe tale, one tripping up another in their eagerness to tell everything,\r\nit gradually developed as distinct a superstition as I ever heard, and\r\nnot without poetry and pathos. How long it was since the voice had been\r\nheard first, nobody could tell with certainty. Jarvis’s opinion was that\r\nhis father, who had been coachman at Brentwood before him, had never\r\nheard anything about it, and that the whole thing had arisen within the\r\nlast ten years, since the complete dismantling of the old house; which\r\nwas a wonderfully modern date for a tale so well authenticated. According\r\nto these witnesses, and to several whom I questioned afterwards, and who\r\nwere all in perfect agreement, it was only in the months of November and\r\nDecember that “the visitation” occurred. During these months, the darkest\r\nof the year, scarcely a night passed without the recurrence of these\r\ninexplicable cries. Nothing, it was said, had ever been seen,--at least,\r\nnothing that could be identified. Some people, bolder or more imaginative\r\nthan the others, had seen the darkness moving, Mrs. Jarvis said, with\r\nunconscious poetry. It began when night fell, and continued, at\r\nintervals, till day broke. Very often it was only all inarticulate cry\r\nand moaning, but sometimes the words which had taken possession of my\r\npoor boy’s fancy had been distinctly audible,--“Oh, mother, let me in!”\r\nThe Jarvises were not aware that there had ever been any investigation\r\ninto it. The estate of Brentwood had lapsed into the hands of a distant\r\nbranch of the family, who had lived but little there; and of the many\r\npeople who had taken it, as I had done, few had remained through two\r\nDecembers. And nobody had taken the trouble to make a very close\r\nexamination into the facts. “No, no,” Jarvis said, shaking his head,\r\n“No, no, Cornel. Wha wad set themsels up for a laughin’-stock to a’ the\r\ncountry-side, making a wark about a ghost? Naebody believes in ghosts. It\r\nbid to be the wind in the trees, the last gentleman said, or some effec’\r\no’ the water wrastlin’ among the rocks. He said it was a’ quite easy\r\nexplained; but he gave up the hoose. And when you cam, Cornel, we were\r\nawfu’ anxious you should never hear. What for should I have spoiled the\r\nbargain and hairmed the property for no-thing?”\r\n\r\n“Do you call my child’s life nothing?” I said in the trouble of the\r\nmoment, unable to restrain myself. “And instead of telling this all to\r\nme, you have told it to him,--to a delicate boy, a child unable to sift\r\nevidence or judge for himself, a tender-hearted young creature--”\r\n\r\nI was walking about the room with an anger all the hotter that I felt it\r\nto be most likely quite unjust. My heart was full of bitterness against\r\nthe stolid retainers of a family who were content to risk other people’s\r\nchildren and comfort rather than let a house be empty. If I had been\r\nwarned I might have taken precautions, or left the place, or sent Roland\r\naway, a hundred things which now I could not do; and here I was with my\r\nboy in a brain-fever, and his life, the most precious life on earth,\r\nhanging in the balance, dependent on whether or not I could get to the\r\nreason of a commonplace ghost-story! I paced about in high wrath, not\r\nseeing what I was to do; for to take Roland away, even if he were able to\r\ntravel, would not settle his agitated mind; and I feared even that a\r\nscientific explanation of refracted sound or reverberation, or any other\r\nof the easy certainties with which we elder men are silenced, would have\r\nvery little effect upon the boy.\r\n\r\n“Cornel,” said Jarvis solemnly, “and _she’ll_ bear me witness,--the young\r\ngentleman never heard a word from me--no, nor from either groom or\r\ngardener; I’ll gie ye my word for that. In the first place, he’s no a lad\r\nthat invites ye to talk. There are some that are, and some that arena.\r\nSome will draw ye on, till ye’ve tellt them a’ the clatter of the toun,\r\nand a’ ye ken, and whiles mair. But Maister Roland, his mind’s fu’ of his\r\nbooks. He’s aye civil and kind, and a fine lad; but no that sort. And ye\r\nsee it’s for a’ our interest, Cornel, that you should stay at Brentwood.\r\nI took it upon me mysel to pass the word,--‘No a syllable to Maister\r\nRoland, nor to the young leddies--no a syllable.’ The women-servants,\r\nthat have little reason to be out at night, ken little or nothing about\r\nit. And some think it grand to have a ghost so long as they’re no in the\r\nway of coming across it. If you had been tellt the story to begin with,\r\nmaybe ye would have thought so yourself.”\r\n\r\nThis was true enough, though it did not throw any light upon my\r\nperplexity. If we had heard of it to start with, it is possible that all\r\nthe family would have considered the possession of a ghost a distinct\r\nadvantage. It is the fashion of the times. We never think what a risk it\r\nis to play with young imaginations, but cry out, in the fashionable\r\njargon, “A ghost!--nothing else was wanted to make it perfect.” I should\r\nnot have been above this myself. I should have smiled, of course, at the\r\nidea of the ghost at all, but then to feel that it was mine would have\r\npleased my vanity. Oh, yes, I claim no exemption. The girls would have\r\nbeen delighted. I could fancy their eagerness, their interest, and\r\nexcitement. No; if we had been told, it would have done no good,--we\r\nshould have made the bargain all the more eagerly, the fools that we are.\r\n“And there has been no attempt to investigate it,” I said, “to see what\r\nit really is?”\r\n\r\n“Eh, Cornel,” said the coachman’s wife, “wha would investigate, as ye\r\ncall it, a thing that nobody believes in? Ye would be the laughin’-stock\r\nof a’ the country-side, as my man says.”\r\n\r\n“But you believe in it,” I said, turning upon her hastily. The woman was\r\ntaken by surprise. She made a step backward out of my way.\r\n\r\n“Lord, Cornel, how ye frichten a body! Me!--there’s awfu’ strange things\r\nin this world. An unlearned person doesna ken what to think. But the\r\nminister and the gentry they just laugh in your face. Inquire into the\r\nthing that is not! Na, na, we just let it be.”\r\n\r\n“Come with me, Jarvis,” I said hastily, “and we’ll make an attempt at\r\nleast. Say nothing to the men or to anybody. I’ll come back after dinner,\r\nand we’ll make a serious attempt to see what it is, if it is anything. If\r\nI hear it,--which I doubt,--you may be sure I shall never rest till I\r\nmake it out. Be ready for me about ten o’clock.”\r\n\r\n“Me, Cornel!” Jarvis said, in a faint voice. I had not been looking at\r\nhim in my own preoccupation, but when I did so, I found that the greatest\r\nchange had come over the fat and ruddy coachman. “Me, Cornel!” he\r\nrepeated, wiping the perspiration from his brow. His ruddy face hung in\r\nflabby folds, his knees knocked together, his voice seemed half\r\nextinguished in his throat. Then he began to rub his hands and smile upon\r\nme in a deprecating, imbecile way. “There’s nothing I wouldna do to\r\npleasure ye, Cornel,” taking a step further back. “I’m sure _she_ kens\r\nI’ve aye said I never had to do with a mair fair, weel-spoken\r\ngentleman--” Here Jarvis came to a pause, again looking at me, rubbing\r\nhis hands.\r\n\r\n“Well?” I said.\r\n\r\n“But eh, sir!” he went on, with the same imbecile yet insinuating smile,\r\n“if ye’ll reflect that I am no used to my feet. With a horse atween my\r\nlegs, or the reins in my hand, I’m maybe nae worse than other men; but on\r\nfit, Cornel--It’s no the--bogles--but I’ve been cavalry, ye see,” with a\r\nlittle hoarse laugh, “a’ my life. To face a thing ye dinna understan’--on\r\nyour feet, Cornel.”\r\n\r\n“Well, sir, if _I_ do it,” said I tartly, “why shouldn’t you?”\r\n\r\n“Eh, Cornel, there’s an awfu’ difference. In the first place, ye tramp\r\nabout the haill countryside, and think naething of it; but a walk tires\r\nme mair than a hunard miles’ drive; and then ye’re a gentleman, and do\r\nyour ain pleasure; and you’re no so auld as me; and it’s for your ain\r\nbairn, ye see, Cornel; and then--”\r\n\r\n“He believes in it, Cornel, and you dinna believe in it,” the woman said.\r\n\r\n“Will you come with me?” I said, turning to her.\r\n\r\nShe jumped back, upsetting her chair in her bewilderment. “Me!” with a\r\nscream, and then fell into a sort of hysterical laugh. “I wouldna say but\r\nwhat I would go; but what would the folk say to hear of Cornel Mortimer\r\nwith an auld silly woman at his heels?”\r\n\r\nThe suggestion made me laugh too, though I had little inclination for it.\r\n“I’m sorry you have so little spirit, Jarvis,” I said. “I must find some\r\none else, I suppose.”\r\n\r\nJarvis, touched by this, began to remonstrate, but I cut him short. My\r\nbutler was a soldier who had been with me in India, and was not supposed\r\nto fear anything,--man or devil,--certainly not the former; and I felt\r\nthat I was losing time. The Jarvises were too thankful to get rid of me.\r\nThey attended me to the door with the most anxious courtesies. Outside,\r\nthe two grooms stood close by, a little confused by my sudden exit. I\r\ndon’t know if perhaps they had been listening,--at least standing as near\r\nas possible, to catch any scrap of the conversation. I waved my hand to\r\nthem as I went past, in answer to their salutations, and it was very\r\napparent to me that they also were glad to see me go.\r\n\r\nAnd it will be thought very strange, but it would be weak not to add,\r\nthat I myself, though bent on the investigation I have spoken of, pledged\r\nto Roland to carry it out, and feeling that my boy’s health, perhaps his\r\nlife, depended on the result of my inquiry,--I felt the most\r\nunaccountable reluctance to pass these ruins on my way home. My curiosity\r\nwas intense; and yet it was all my mind could do to pull my body along. I\r\ndaresay the scientific people would describe it the other way, and\r\nattribute my cowardice to the state of my stomach. I went on; but if I\r\nhad followed my impulse, I should have turned and bolted. Everything in\r\nme seemed to cry out against it: my heart thumped, my pulses all began,\r\nlike sledge-hammers, beating against my ears and every sensitive part. It\r\nwas very dark, as I have said; the old house, with its shapeless tower,\r\nloomed a heavy mass through the darkness, which was only not entirely so\r\nsolid as itself. On the other hand, the great dark cedars of which we\r\nwere so proud seemed to fill up the night. My foot strayed out of the\r\npath in my confusion and the gloom together, and I brought myself up with\r\na cry as I felt myself knock against something solid. What was it? The\r\ncontact with hard stone and lime and prickly bramble-bushes restored me a\r\nlittle to myself. “Oh, it’s only the old gable,” I said aloud, with a\r\nlittle laugh to reassure myself. The rough feeling of the stones\r\nreconciled me. As I groped about thus, I shook off my visionary folly.\r\nWhat so easily explained as that I should have strayed from the path in\r\nthe darkness? This brought me back to common existence, as if I had been\r\nshaken by a wise hand out of all the silliness of superstition. How silly\r\nit was, after all! What did it matter which path I took? I laughed again,\r\nthis time with better heart, when suddenly, in a moment, the blood was\r\nchilled in my veins, a shiver stole along my spine, my faculties seemed\r\nto forsake me. Close by me, at my side, at my feet, there was a sigh. No,\r\nnot a groan, not a moaning, not anything so tangible,--a perfectly soft,\r\nfaint, inarticulate sigh. I sprang back, and my heart stopped beating.\r\nMistaken! no, mistake was impossible. I heard it as clearly as I hear\r\nmyself speak; a long, soft, weary sigh, as if drawn to the utmost, and\r\nemptying out a load of sadness that filled the breast. To hear this in\r\nthe solitude, in the dark, in the night (though it was still early), had\r\nan effect which I cannot describe. I feel it now,--something cold\r\ncreeping over me, up into my hair, and down to my feet, which refused to\r\nmove. I cried out, with a trembling voice, “Who is there?” as I had done\r\nbefore; but there was no reply.\r\n\r\nI got home I don’t quite know how; but in my mind there was no longer\r\nany indifference as to the thing, whatever it was, that haunted these\r\nruins. My scepticism disappeared like a mist. I was as firmly determined\r\nthat there was something as Roland was. I did not for a moment pretend\r\nto myself that it was possible I could be deceived; there were movements\r\nand noises which I understood all about,--cracklings of small branches\r\nin the frost, and little rolls of gravel on the path, such as have a\r\nvery eerie sound sometimes, and perplex you with wonder as to who has\r\ndone it, _when there is no real mystery_; but I assure you all these\r\nlittle movements of nature don’t affect you one bit _when there is\r\nsomething_. I understood _them_. I did not understand the sigh. That was\r\nnot simple nature; there was meaning in it, feeling, the soul of a\r\ncreature invisible. This is the thing that human nature trembles at,--a\r\ncreature invisible, yet with sensations, feelings, a power somehow of\r\nexpressing itself. I had not the same sense of unwillingness to turn my\r\nback upon the scene of the mystery which I had experienced in going to\r\nthe stables; but I almost ran home, impelled by eagerness to get\r\neverything done that had to be done, in order to apply myself to finding\r\nit out. Bagley was in the hall as usual when I went in. He was always\r\nthere in the afternoon, always with the appearance of perfect\r\noccupation, yet, so far as I know, never doing anything. The door was\r\nopen, so that I hurried in without any pause, breathless; but the sight\r\nof his calm regard, as he came to help me off with my overcoat, subdued\r\nme in a moment. Anything out of the way, anything incomprehensible,\r\nfaded to nothing in the presence of Bagley. You saw and wondered how\r\n_he_ was made: the parting of his hair, the tie of his white neckcloth,\r\nthe fit of his trousers, all perfect as works of art; but you could see\r\nhow they were done, which makes all the difference. I flung myself upon\r\nhim, so to speak, without waiting to note the extreme unlikeness of the\r\nman to anything of the kind I meant. “Bagley,” I said, “I want you to\r\ncome out with me to-night to watch for--”\r\n\r\n“Poachers, Colonel?” he said, a gleam of pleasure running all over him.\r\n\r\n“No, Bagley; a great deal worse,” I cried.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Colonel; at what hour, sir?” the man said; but then I had not told\r\nhim what it was.\r\n\r\nIt was ten o’clock when we set out. All was perfectly quiet indoors. My\r\nwife was with Roland, who had been quite calm, she said, and who (though,\r\nno doubt, the fever must run its course) had been better ever since I\r\ncame. I told Bagley to put on a thick greatcoat over his evening coat,\r\nand did the same myself, with strong boots; for the soil was like a\r\nsponge, or worse. Talking to him, I almost forgot what we were going to\r\ndo. It was darker even than it had been before, and Bagley kept very\r\nclose to me as we went along. I had a small lantern in my hand, which\r\ngave us a partial guidance. We had come to the corner where the path\r\nturns. On one side was the bowling-green, which the girls had taken\r\npossession of for their croquet-ground,--a wonderful enclosure surrounded\r\nby high hedges of holly, three hundred years old and more; on the other,\r\nthe ruins. Both were black as night; but before we got so far, there was\r\na little opening in which we could just discern the trees and the lighter\r\nline of the road. I thought it best to pause there and take breath.\r\n“Bagley,” I said, “there is something about these ruins I don’t\r\nunderstand. It is there I am going. Keep your eyes open and your wits\r\nabout you. Be ready to pounce upon any stranger you see,--anything, man\r\nor woman. Don’t hurt, but seize anything you see.” “Colonel,” said\r\nBagley, with a little tremor in his breath, “they do say there’s things\r\nthere--as is neither man nor woman.” There was no time for words. “Are\r\nyou game to follow me, my man? that’s the question,” I said. Bagley fell\r\nin without a word, and saluted. I knew then I had nothing to fear.\r\n\r\nWe went, so far as I could guess, exactly as I had come; when I heard\r\nthat sigh. The darkness, however, was so complete that all marks, as of\r\ntrees or paths, disappeared. One moment we felt our feet on the gravel,\r\nanother sinking noiselessly into the slippery grass, that was all. I had\r\nshut up my lantern, not wishing to scare any one, whoever it might be.\r\nBagley followed, it seemed to me, exactly in my footsteps as I made my\r\nway, as I supposed, towards the mass of the ruined house. We seemed to\r\ntake a long time groping along seeking this; the squash of the wet soil\r\nunder our feet was the only thing that marked our progress. After a while\r\nI stood still to see, or rather feel, where we were. The darkness was\r\nvery still, but no stiller than is usual in a winter’s night. The sounds\r\nI have mentioned--the crackling of twigs, the roll of a pebble, the sound\r\nof some rustle in the dead leaves, or creeping creature on the\r\ngrass--were audible when you listened, all mysterious enough when your\r\nmind is disengaged, but to me cheering now as signs of the livingness of\r\nnature, even in the death of the frost. As we stood still there came up\r\nfrom the trees in the glen the prolonged hoot of an owl. Bagley started\r\nwith alarm, being in a state of general nervousness, and not knowing what\r\nhe was afraid of. But to me the sound was encouraging and pleasant, being\r\nso comprehensible.\r\n\r\n“An owl,” I said, under my breath. “Y--es, Colonel,” said Bagley, his\r\nteeth chattering. We stood still about five minutes, while it broke into\r\nthe still brooding of the air, the sound widening out in circles, dying\r\nupon the darkness. This sound, which is not a cheerful one, made me\r\nalmost gay. It was natural, and relieved the tension of the mind. I moved\r\non with new courage, my nervous excitement calming down.\r\n\r\nWhen all at once, quite suddenly, close to us, at our feet, there broke\r\nout a cry. I made a spring backwards in the first moment of surprise and\r\nhorror, and in doing so came sharply against the same rough masonry and\r\nbrambles that had struck me before. This new sound came upwards from the\r\nground,--a low, moaning, wailing voice, full of suffering and pain. The\r\ncontrast between it and the hoot of the owl was indescribable,--the one\r\nwith a wholesome wildness and naturalness that hurt nobody; the other, a\r\nsound that made one’s blood curdle, full of human misery. With a great\r\ndeal of fumbling,--for in spite of everything I could do to keep up my\r\ncourage my hands shook,--I managed to remove the slide of my lantern. The\r\nlight leaped out like something living, and made the place visible in a\r\nmoment. We were what would have been inside the ruined building had\r\nanything remained but the gable-wall which I have described. It was close\r\nto us, the vacant door-way in it going out straight into the blackness\r\noutside. The light showed the bit of wall, the ivy glistening upon it in\r\nclouds of dark green, the bramble-branches waving, and below, the open\r\ndoor,--a door that led to nothing. It was from this the voice came which\r\ndied out just as the light flashed upon this strange scene. There was a\r\nmoment’s silence, and then it broke forth again. The sound was so near,\r\nso penetrating, so pitiful, that, in the nervous start I gave, the light\r\nfell out of my hand. As I groped for it in the dark my hand was clutched\r\nby Bagley, who, I think, must have dropped upon his knees; but I was too\r\nmuch perturbed myself to think much of this. He clutched at me in the\r\nconfusion of his terror, forgetting all his usual decorum. “For God’s\r\nsake, what is it, sir?” he gasped. If I yielded, there was evidently an\r\nend of both of us. “I can’t tell,” I said, “any more than you; that’s\r\nwhat we’ve got to find out. Up, man, up!” I pulled him to his feet. “Will\r\nyou go round and examine the other side, or will you stay here with the\r\nlantern?” Bagley gasped at me with a face of horror. “Can’t we stay\r\ntogether, Colonel?” he said; his knees were trembling under him. I pushed\r\nhim against the corner of the wall, and put the light into his hands.\r\n“Stand fast till I come back; shake yourself together, man; let nothing\r\npass you,” I said. The voice was within two or three feet of us; of that\r\nthere could be no doubt.\r\n\r\nI went myself to the other side of the wall, keeping close to it. The\r\nlight shook in Bagley’s hand, but, tremulous though it was, shone out\r\nthrough the vacant door, one oblong block of light marking all the\r\ncrumbling corners and hanging masses of foliage. Was that something dark\r\nhuddled in a heap by the side of it? I pushed forward across the light in\r\nthe door-way, and fell upon it with my hands; but it was only a\r\njuniper-bush growing close against the wall. Meanwhile, the sight of my\r\nfigure crossing the door-way had brought Bagley’s nervous excitement to a\r\nheight: he flew at me, gripping my shoulder. “I’ve got him, Colonel!\r\nI’ve got him!” he cried, with a voice of sudden exultation. He thought it\r\nwas a man, and was at once relieved. But at that moment the voice burst\r\nforth again between us, at our feet,--more close to us than any separate\r\nbeing could be. He dropped off from me, and fell against the wall, his\r\njaw dropping as if he were dying. I suppose, at the same moment, he saw\r\nthat it was me whom he had clutched. I, for my part, had scarcely more\r\ncommand of myself. I snatched the light out of his hand, and flashed it\r\nall about me wildly. Nothing,--the juniper-bush which I thought I had\r\nnever seen before, the heavy growth of the glistening ivy, the brambles\r\nwaving. It was close to my ears now, crying, crying, pleading as if for\r\nlife. Either I heard the same words Roland had heard, or else, in my\r\nexcitement, his imagination got possession of mine. The voice went on,\r\ngrowing into distinct articulation, but wavering about, now from one\r\npoint, now from another, as if the owner of it were moving slowly back\r\nand forward. “Mother! mother!” and then an outburst of wailing. As my\r\nmind steadied, getting accustomed (as one’s mind gets accustomed to\r\nanything), it seemed to me as if some uneasy, miserable creature was\r\npacing up and down before a closed door. Sometimes--but that must have\r\nbeen excitement--I thought I heard a sound like knocking, and then\r\nanother burst, “Oh, mother! mother!” All this close, close to the space\r\nwhere I was standing with my lantern, now before me, now behind me: a\r\ncreature restless, unhappy, moaning, crying, before the vacant door-way,\r\nwhich no one could either shut or open more.\r\n\r\n“Do you hear it, Bagley? do you hear what it is saying?” I cried,\r\nstepping in through the door-way. He was lying against the wall, his eyes\r\nglazed, half dead with terror. He made a motion of his lips as if to\r\nanswer me, but no sounds came; then lifted his hand with a curious\r\nimperative movement as if ordering me to be silent and listen. And how\r\nlong I did so I cannot tell. It began to have an interest, an exciting\r\nhold upon me, which I could not describe. It seemed to call up visibly a\r\nscene any one could understand,--a something shut out, restlessly\r\nwandering to and fro; sometimes the voice dropped, as if throwing itself\r\ndown, sometimes wandered off a few paces, growing sharp and clear. “Oh,\r\nmother, let me in! oh, mother, mother, let me in! oh, let me in!” Every\r\nword was clear to me. No wonder the boy had gone wild with pity. I tried\r\nto steady my mind upon Roland, upon his conviction that I could do\r\nsomething, but my head swam with the excitement, even when I partially\r\novercame the terror. At last the words died away, and there was a sound\r\nof sobs and moaning. I cried out, “In the name of God, who are you?” with\r\na kind of feeling in my mind that to use the name of God was profane,\r\nseeing that I did not believe in ghosts or anything supernatural; but I\r\ndid it all the same, and waited, my heart giving a leap of terror lest\r\nthere should be a reply. Why this should have been I cannot tell, but I\r\nhad a feeling that if there was an answer it would be more than I could\r\nbear. But there was no answer; the moaning went on, and then, as if it\r\nhad been real, the voice rose a little higher again, the words\r\nrecommenced, “Oh, mother, let me in! oh, mother, let me in!” with an\r\nexpression that was heart-breaking to hear.\r\n\r\n_As if it had been real_! What do I mean by that? I suppose I got less\r\nalarmed as the thing went on. I began to recover the use of my senses,--I\r\nseemed to explain it all to myself by saying that this had once happened,\r\nthat it was a recollection of a real scene. Why there should have seemed\r\nsomething quite satisfactory and composing in this explanation I cannot\r\ntell, but so it was. I began to listen almost as if it had been a play,\r\nforgetting Bagley, who, I almost think, had fainted, leaning against the\r\nwall. I was startled out of this strange spectatorship that had fallen\r\nupon me by the sudden rush of something which made my heart jump once\r\nmore, a large black figure in the door-way waving its arms. “Come in!\r\ncome in! come in!” it shouted out hoarsely at the top of a deep bass\r\nvoice, and then poor Bagley fell down senseless across the threshold. He\r\nwas less sophisticated than I,--he had not been able to bear it any\r\nlonger. I took him for something supernatural, as he took me, and it was\r\nsome time before I awoke to the necessities of the moment. I remembered\r\nonly after, that from the time I began to give my attention to the man, I\r\nheard the other voice no more. It was some time before I brought him to.\r\nIt must have been a strange scene: the lantern making a luminous spot in\r\nthe darkness, the man’s white face lying on the black earth, I over him,\r\ndoing what I could for him, probably I should have been thought to be\r\nmurdering him had any one seen us. When at last I succeeded in pouring a\r\nlittle brandy down his throat, he sat up and looked about him wildly.\r\n“What’s up?” he said; then recognizing me, tried to struggle to his feet\r\nwith a faint “Beg your pardon, Colonel.” I got him home as best I could,\r\nmaking him lean upon my arm. The great fellow was as weak as a child.\r\nFortunately he did not for some time remember what had happened. From the\r\ntime Bagley fell the voice had stopped, and all was still.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“You’ve got an epidemic in your house, Colonel,” Simson said to me next\r\nmorning. “What’s the meaning of it all? Here’s your butler raving about a\r\nvoice. This will never do, you know; and so far as I can make out, you\r\nare in it too.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I am in it, Doctor. I thought I had better speak to you. Of course\r\nyou are treating Roland all right, but the boy is not raving, he is as\r\nsane as you or me. It’s all true.”\r\n\r\n“As sane as--I--or you. I never thought the boy insane. He’s got cerebral\r\nexcitement, fever. I don’t know what you’ve got. There’s something very\r\nqueer about the look of your eyes.”\r\n\r\n“Come,” said I, “you can’t put us all to bed, you know. You had better\r\nlisten and hear the symptoms in full.”\r\n\r\nThe Doctor shrugged his shoulders, but he listened to me patiently. He\r\ndid not believe a word of the story, that was clear; but he heard it all\r\nfrom beginning to end. “My dear fellow,” he said, “the boy told me just\r\nthe same. It’s an epidemic. When one person falls a victim to this sort\r\nof thing, it’s as safe as can be,--there’s always two or three.”\r\n\r\n“Then how do you account for it?” I said.\r\n\r\n“Oh, account for it!--that’s a different matter; there’s no accounting\r\nfor the freaks our brains are subject to. If it’s delusion, if it’s some\r\ntrick of the echoes or the winds,--some phonetic disturbance or other--”\r\n\r\n“Come with me to-night, and judge for yourself,” I said.\r\n\r\nUpon this he laughed aloud, then said, “That’s not such a bad idea; but\r\nit would ruin me forever if it were known that John Simson was\r\nghost-hunting.”\r\n\r\n“There it is,” said I; “you dart down on us who are unlearned with your\r\nphonetic disturbances, but you daren’t examine what the thing really is\r\nfor fear of being laughed at. That’s science!”\r\n\r\n“It’s not science,--it’s common-sense,” said the Doctor. “The thing has\r\ndelusion on the front of it. It is encouraging an unwholesome tendency\r\neven to examine. What good could come of it? Even if I am convinced, I\r\nshouldn’t believe.”\r\n\r\n“I should have said so yesterday; and I don’t want you to be convinced or\r\nto believe,” said I. “If you prove it to be a delusion, I shall be very\r\nmuch obliged to you for one. Come; somebody must go with me.”\r\n\r\n“You are cool,” said the Doctor. “You’ve disabled this poor fellow of\r\nyours, and made him--on that point--a lunatic for life; and now you want\r\nto disable me. But, for once, I’ll do it. To save appearance, if you’ll\r\ngive me a bed, I’ll come over after my last rounds.”\r\n\r\nIt was agreed that I should meet him at the gate, and that we should\r\nvisit the scene of last night’s occurrences before we came to the house,\r\nso that nobody might be the wiser. It was scarcely possible to hope that\r\nthe cause of Bagley’s sudden illness should not somehow steal into the\r\nknowledge of the servants at least, and it was better that all should be\r\ndone as quietly as possible. The day seemed to me a very long one. I had\r\nto spend a certain part of it with Roland, which was a terrible ordeal\r\nfor me, for what could I say to the boy? The improvement continued, but\r\nhe was still in a very precarious state, and the trembling vehemence with\r\nwhich he turned to me when his mother left the room filled me with alarm.\r\n“Father?” he said quietly. “Yes, my boy, I am giving my best attention to\r\nit; all is being done that I can do. I have not come to any\r\nconclusion--yet. I am neglecting nothing you said,” I cried. What I could\r\nnot do was to give his active mind any encouragement to dwell upon the\r\nmystery. It was a hard predicament, for some satisfaction had to be given\r\nhim. He looked at me very wistfully, with the great blue eyes which shone\r\nso large and brilliant out of his white and worn face. “You must trust\r\nme,” I said. “Yes, father. Father understands,” he said to himself, as if\r\nto soothe some inward doubt. I left him as soon as I could. He was about\r\nthe most precious thing I had on earth, and his health my first thought;\r\nbut yet somehow, in the excitement of this other subject, I put that\r\naside, and preferred not to dwell upon Roland, which was the most curious\r\npart of it all.\r\n\r\nThat night at eleven I met Simson at the gate. He had come by train, and\r\nI let him in gently myself. I had been so much absorbed in the coming\r\nexperiment that I passed the ruins in going to meet him, almost without\r\nthought, if you can understand that. I had my lantern; and he showed me a\r\ncoil of taper which he had ready for use. “There is nothing like light,”\r\nhe said, in his scoffing tone. It was a very still night, scarcely a\r\nsound, but not so dark. We could keep the path without difficulty as we\r\nwent along. As we approached the spot we could hear a low moaning, broken\r\noccasionally by a bitter cry. “Perhaps that is your voice,” said the\r\nDoctor; “I thought it must be something of the kind. That’s a poor brute\r\ncaught in some of these infernal traps of yours; you’ll find it among the\r\nbushes somewhere.” I said nothing. I felt no particular fear, but a\r\ntriumphant satisfaction in what was to follow. I led him to the spot\r\nwhere Bagley and I had stood on the previous night. All was silent as a\r\nwinter night could be,--so silent that we heard far off the sound of the\r\nhorses in the stables, the shutting of a window at the house. Simson\r\nlighted his taper and went peering about, poking into all the corners. We\r\nlooked like two conspirators lying in wait for some unfortunate\r\ntraveller; but not a sound broke the quiet. The moaning had stopped\r\nbefore we came up; a star or two shone over us in the sky, looking down\r\nas if surprised at our strange proceedings. Dr. Simson did nothing but\r\nutter subdued laughs under his breath. “I thought as much,” he said. “It\r\nis just the same with tables and all other kinds of ghostly apparatus; a\r\nsceptic’s presence stops everything. When I am present nothing ever comes\r\noff. How long do you think it will be necessary to stay here? Oh, I don’t\r\ncomplain; only when _you_ are satisfied, _I_ am--quite.”\r\n\r\nI will not deny that I was disappointed beyond measure by this result. It\r\nmade me look like a credulous fool. It gave the Doctor such a pull over\r\nme as nothing else could. I should point all his morals for years to\r\ncome; and his materialism, his scepticism, would be increased beyond\r\nendurance. “It seems, indeed,” I said, “that there is to be no--”\r\n“Manifestation,” he said, laughing; “that is what all the mediums say. No\r\nmanifestations, in consequence of the presence of an unbeliever.” His\r\nlaugh sounded very uncomfortable to me in the silence; and it was now\r\nnear midnight. But that laugh seemed the signal; before it died away the\r\nmoaning we had heard before was resumed. It started from some distance\r\noff, and came towards us, nearer and nearer, like some one walking along\r\nand moaning to himself. There could be no idea now that it was a hare\r\ncaught in a trap. The approach was slow, like that of a weak person, with\r\nlittle halts and pauses. We heard it coming along the grass straight\r\ntowards the vacant door-way. Simson had been a little startled by the\r\nfirst sound. He said hastily, “That child has no business to be out so\r\nlate.” But he felt, as well as I, that this was no child’s voice. As it\r\ncame nearer, he grew silent, and, going to the door-way with his taper,\r\nstood looking out towards the sound. The taper being unprotected blew\r\nabout in the night air, though there was scarcely any wind. I threw the\r\nlight of my lantern steady and white across the same space. It was in a\r\nblaze of light in the midst of the blackness. A little icy thrill had\r\ngone over me at the first sound, but as it came close, I confess that my\r\nonly feeling was satisfaction. The scoffer could scoff no more. The light\r\ntouched his own face, and showed a very perplexed countenance. If he was\r\nafraid, he concealed it with great success, but he was perplexed. And\r\nthen all that had happened on the previous night was enacted once more.\r\nIt fell strangely upon me with a sense of repetition. Every cry, every\r\nsob seemed the same as before. I listened almost without any emotion at\r\nall in my own person, thinking of its effect upon Simson. He maintained a\r\nvery bold front, on the whole. All that coming and going of the voice\r\nwas, if our ears could be trusted, exactly in front of the vacant, blank\r\ndoor-way, blazing full of light, which caught and shone in the glistening\r\nleaves of the great hollies at a little distance. Not a rabbit could have\r\ncrossed the turf without being seen; but there was nothing. After a time,\r\nSimson, with a certain caution and bodily reluctance, as it seemed to me,\r\nwent out with his roll of taper into this space. His figure showed\r\nagainst the holly in full outline. Just at this moment the voice sank, as\r\nwas its custom, and seemed to fling itself down at the door. Simson\r\nrecoiled violently, as if some one had come up against him, then turned,\r\nand held his taper low, as if examining something. “Do you see anybody?”\r\nI cried in a whisper, feeling the chill of nervous panic steal over me at\r\nthis action. “It’s nothing but a--confounded juniper-bush,” he said. This\r\nI knew very well to be nonsense, for the juniper-bush was on the other\r\nside. He went about after this round and round, poking his taper\r\neverywhere, then returned to me on the inner side of the wall. He scoffed\r\nno longer; his face was contracted and pale. “How long does this go on?”\r\nhe whispered to me, like a man who does not wish to interrupt some one\r\nwho is speaking. I had become too much perturbed myself to remark whether\r\nthe successions and changes of the voice were the same as last night. It\r\nsuddenly went out in the air almost as he was speaking, with a soft\r\nreiterated sob dying away. If there had been anything to be seen, I\r\nshould have said that the person was at that moment crouching on the\r\nground close to the door.\r\n\r\nWe walked home very silent afterwards. It was only when we were in sight\r\nof the house that I said, “What do you think of it?” “I can’t tell what\r\nto think of it,” he said quickly. He took--though he was a very temperate\r\nman--not the claret I was going to offer him, but some brandy from the\r\ntray, and swallowed it almost undiluted. “Mind you, I don’t believe a\r\nword of it,” he said, when he had lighted his candle; “but I can’t tell\r\nwhat to think,” he turned round to add, when he was half-way upstairs.\r\n\r\nAll of this, however, did me no good with the solution of my problem. I\r\nwas to help this weeping, sobbing thing, which was already to me as\r\ndistinct a personality as anything I knew; or what should I say to\r\nRoland? It was on my heart that my boy would die if I could not find some\r\nway of helping this creature. You may be surprised that I should speak of\r\nit in this way. I did not know if it was man or woman; but I no more\r\ndoubted that it was a soul in pain than I doubted my own being; and it\r\nwas my business to soothe this pain,--to deliver it, if that was\r\npossible. Was ever such a task given to an anxious father trembling for\r\nhis only boy? I felt in my heart, fantastic as it may appear, that I must\r\nfulfill this somehow, or part with my child; and you may conceive that\r\nrather than do that I was ready to die. But even my dying would not have\r\nadvanced me, unless by bringing me into the same world with that seeker\r\nat the door.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNext morning Simson was out before breakfast, and came in with evident\r\nsigns of the damp grass on his boots, and a look of worry and weariness,\r\nwhich did not say much for the night he had passed. He improved a little\r\nafter breakfast, and visited his two patients,--for Bagley was still an\r\ninvalid. I went out with him on his way to the train, to hear what he\r\nhad to say about the boy. “He is going on very well,” he said; “there are\r\nno complications as yet. But mind you, that’s not a boy to be trifled\r\nwith, Mortimer. Not a word to him about last night.” I had to tell him\r\nthen of my last interview with Roland, and of the impossible demand he\r\nhad made upon me, by which, though he tried to laugh, he was much\r\ndiscomposed, as I could see. “We must just perjure ourselves all round,”\r\nhe said, “and swear you exorcised it;” but the man was too kind-hearted\r\nto be satisfied with that. “It’s frightfully serious for you, Mortimer. I\r\ncan’t laugh as I should like to. I wish I saw a way out of it, for your\r\nsake. By the way,” he added shortly, “didn’t you notice that juniper-bush\r\non the left-hand side?” “There was one on the right hand of the door. I\r\nnoticed you made that mistake last night.” “Mistake!” he cried, with a\r\ncurious low laugh, pulling up the collar of his coat as though he felt\r\nthe cold,--“there’s no juniper there this morning, left or right. Just go\r\nand see.” As he stepped into the train a few minutes after, he looked\r\nback upon me and beckoned me for a parting word. “I’m coming back\r\nto-night,” he said.\r\n\r\nI don’t think I had any feeling about this as I turned away from that\r\ncommon bustle of the railway which made my private preoccupations feel so\r\nstrangely out of date. There had been a distinct satisfaction in my mind\r\nbefore, that his scepticism had been so entirely defeated. But the more\r\nserious part of the matter pressed upon me now. I went straight from the\r\nrailway to the manse, which stood on a little plateau on the side of the\r\nriver opposite to the woods of Brentwood. The minister was one of a class\r\nwhich is not so common in Scotland as it used to be. He was a man of good\r\nfamily, well educated in the Scotch way, strong in philosophy, not so\r\nstrong in Greek, strongest of all in experience,--a man who had “come\r\nacross,” in the course of his life, most people of note that had ever\r\nbeen in Scotland, and who was said to be very sound in doctrine, without\r\ninfringing the toleration with which old men, who are good men, are\r\ngenerally endowed. He was old-fashioned; perhaps he did not think so much\r\nabout the troublous problems of theology as many of the young men, nor\r\nask himself any hard questions about the Confession of Faith; but he\r\nunderstood human nature, which is perhaps better. He received me with a\r\ncordial welcome.\r\n\r\n“Come away, Colonel Mortimer,” he said; “I’m all the more glad to see\r\nyou, that I feel it’s a good sign for the boy. He’s doing well?--God be\r\npraised,--and the Lord bless him and keep him. He has many a poor body’s\r\nprayers, and that can do nobody harm.”\r\n\r\n“He will need them all, Dr. Moncrieff,” I said, “and your counsel too.”\r\nAnd I told him the story,--more than I had told Simson. The old clergyman\r\nlistened to me with many suppressed exclamations, and at the end the\r\nwater stood in his eyes.\r\n\r\n“That’s just beautiful,” he said. “I do not mind to have heard anything\r\nlike it; it’s as fine as Burns when he wished deliverance to one--that is\r\nprayed for in no kirk. Ay, ay! so he would have you console the poor lost\r\nspirit? God bless the boy! There’s something more than common in that,\r\nColonel Mortimer. And also the faith of him in his father!--I would like\r\nto put that into a sermon.” Then the old gentleman gave me an alarmed\r\nlook, and said, “No, no; I was not meaning a sermon; but I must write it\r\ndown for the ‘Children’s Record.’” I saw the thought that passed through\r\nhis mind. Either he thought, or he feared I would think, of a funeral\r\nsermon. You may believe this did not make me more cheerful.\r\n\r\nI can scarcely say that Dr. Moncrieff gave me any advice. How could any\r\none advise on such a subject? But he said, “I think I’ll come too. I’m an\r\nold man; I’m less liable to be frightened than those that are further off\r\nthe world unseen. It behooves me to think of my own journey there. I’ve\r\nno cut-and-dry beliefs on the subject. I’ll come too; and maybe at the\r\nmoment the Lord will put into our heads what to do.”\r\n\r\nThis gave me a little comfort,--more than Simson had given me. To be\r\nclear about the cause of it was not my grand desire. It was another thing\r\nthat was in my mind,--my boy. As for the poor soul at the open door, I\r\nhad no more doubt, as I have said, of its existence than I had of my own.\r\nIt was no ghost to me. I knew the creature, and it was in trouble. That\r\nwas my feeling about it, as it was Roland’s. To hear it first was a great\r\nshock to my nerves, but not now; a man will get accustomed to anything.\r\nBut to do something for it was the great problem; how was I to be\r\nserviceable to a being that was invisible, that was mortal no longer?\r\n“Maybe at the moment the Lord will put it into our heads.” This is very\r\nold-fashioned phraseology, and a week before, most likely, I should have\r\nsmiled (though always with kindness) at Dr. Moncrieff’s credulity; but\r\nthere was a great comfort, whether rational or otherwise I cannot say, in\r\nthe mere sound of the words.\r\n\r\nThe road to the station and the village lay through the glen, not by the\r\nruins; but though the sunshine and the fresh air, and the beauty of the\r\ntrees, and the sound of the water were all very soothing to the spirits,\r\nmy mind was so full of my own subject that I could not refrain from\r\nturning to the right hand as I got to the top of the glen, and going\r\nstraight to the place which I may call the scene of all my thoughts. It\r\nwas lying full in the sunshine, like all the rest of the world. The\r\nruined gable looked due east, and in the present aspect of the sun the\r\nlight streamed down through the door-way as our lantern had done,\r\nthrowing a flood of light upon the damp grass beyond. There was a strange\r\nsuggestion in the open door,--so futile, a kind of emblem of vanity: all\r\nfree around, so that you could go where you pleased, and yet that\r\nsemblance of an enclosure,--that way of entrance, unnecessary, leading to\r\nnothing. And why any creature should pray and weep to get in--to nothing,\r\nor be kept out--by nothing, you could not dwell upon it, or it made your\r\nbrain go round. I remembered, however, what Simson said about the\r\njuniper, with a little smile on my own mind as to the inaccuracy of\r\nrecollection which even a scientific man will be guilty of. I could see\r\nnow the light of my lantern gleaming upon the wet glistening surface of\r\nthe spiky leaves at the right hand,--and he ready to go to the stake for\r\nit that it was the left! I went round to make sure. And then I saw what\r\nhe had said. Right or left there was no juniper at all! I was confounded\r\nby this, though it was entirely a matter of detail nothing at all,--a\r\nbush of brambles waving, the grass growing up to the very walls. But\r\nafter all, though it gave me a shock for a moment, what did that matter?\r\nThere were marks as if a number of footsteps had been up and down in\r\nfront of the door, but these might have been our steps; and all was\r\nbright and peaceful and still. I poked about the other ruin--the larger\r\nruins of the old house--for some time, as I had done before. There were\r\nmarks upon the grass here and there--I could not call them\r\nfootsteps--all about; but that told for nothing one way or another. I had\r\nexamined the ruined rooms closely the first day. They were half filled up\r\nwith soil and _debris_, withered brackens and bramble,--no refuge for any\r\none there. It vexed me that Jarvis should see me coming from that spot\r\nwhen he came up to me for his orders. I don’t know whether my nocturnal\r\nexpeditions had got wind among the servants, but there was a significant\r\nlook in his face. Something in it I felt was like my own sensation when\r\nSimson in the midst of his scepticism was struck dumb. Jarvis felt\r\nsatisfied that his veracity had been put beyond question. I never spoke\r\nto a servant of mine in such a peremptory tone before. I sent him away\r\n“with a flea in his lug,” as the man described it afterwards.\r\nInterference of any kind was intolerable to me at such a moment.\r\n\r\nBut what was strangest of all was, that I could not face Roland. I did\r\nnot go up to his room, as I would have naturally done, at once. This the\r\ngirls could not understand. They saw there was some mystery in it.\r\n“Mother has gone to lie down,” Agatha said; “he has had such a good\r\nnight.” “But he wants you so, papa!” cried little Jeanie, always with her\r\ntwo arms embracing mine in a pretty way she had. I was obliged to go at\r\nlast, but what could I say? I could only kiss him, and tell him to keep\r\nstill,--that I was doing all I could. There is something mystical about\r\nthe patience of a child. “It will come all right, won’t it, father?” he\r\nsaid. “God grant it may! I hope so, Roland.” “Oh, yes, it will come all\r\nright.” Perhaps he understood that in the midst of my anxiety I could not\r\nstay with him as I should have done otherwise. But the girls were more\r\nsurprised than it is possible to describe. They looked at me with\r\nwondering eyes. “If I were ill, papa, and you only stayed with me a\r\nmoment, I should break my heart,” said Agatha. But the boy had a\r\nsympathetic feeling. He knew that of my own will I would not have done\r\nit. I shut myself up in the library, where I could not rest, but kept\r\npacing up and down like a caged beast. What could I do? and if I could do\r\nnothing, what would become of my boy? These were the questions that,\r\nwithout ceasing, pursued each other through my mind.\r\n\r\nSimson came out to dinner, and when the house was all still, and most of\r\nthe servants in bed, we went out and met Dr. Moncrieff, as we had\r\nappointed, at the head of the glen. Simson, for his part, was disposed to\r\nscoff at the Doctor. “If there are to be any spells, you know, I’ll cut\r\nthe whole concern,” he said. I did not make him any reply. I had not\r\ninvited him; he could go or come as he pleased. He was very talkative,\r\nfar more so than suited my humor, as we went on. “One thing is certain,\r\nyou know; there must be some human agency,” he said. “It is all bosh\r\nabout apparitions. I never have investigated the laws of sound to any\r\ngreat extent, and there’s a great deal in ventriloquism that we don’t\r\nknow much about.” “If it’s the same to you,” I said, “I wish you’d keep\r\nall that to yourself, Simson. It doesn’t suit my state of mind.” “Oh, I\r\nhope I know how to respect idiosyncrasy,” he said. The very tone of his\r\nvoice irritated me beyond measure. These scientific fellows, I wonder\r\npeople put up with them as they do, when you have no mind for their\r\ncold-blooded confidence. Dr. Moncrieff met us about eleven o’clock, the\r\nsame time as on the previous night. He was a large man, with a venerable\r\ncountenance and white hair,--old, but in full vigor, and thinking less\r\nof a cold night walk than many a younger man. He had his lantern, as I\r\nhad. We were fully provided with means of lighting the place, and we were\r\nall of us resolute men. We had a rapid consultation as we went up, and\r\nthe result was that we divided to different posts. Dr. Moncrieff remained\r\ninside the wall--if you can call that inside where there was no wall but\r\none. Simson placed himself on the side next the ruins, so as to intercept\r\nany communication with the old house, which was what his mind was fixed\r\nupon. I was posted on the other side. To say that nothing could come near\r\nwithout being seen was self-evident. It had been so also on the previous\r\nnight. Now, with our three lights in the midst of the darkness, the whole\r\nplace seemed illuminated. Dr. Moncrieff’s lantern, which was a large one,\r\nwithout any means of shutting up,--an old-fashioned lantern with a\r\npierced and ornamental top,--shone steadily, the rays shooting out of it\r\nupward into the gloom. He placed it on the grass, where the middle of the\r\nroom, if this had been a room, would have been. The usual effect of the\r\nlight streaming out of the door-way was prevented by the illumination\r\nwhich Simson and I on either side supplied. With these differences,\r\neverything seemed as on the previous night.\r\n\r\nAnd what occurred was exactly the same, with the same air of repetition,\r\npoint for point, as I had formerly remarked. I declare that it seemed to\r\nme as if I were pushed against, put aside, by the owner of the voice as\r\nhe paced up and down in his trouble,--though these are perfectly futile\r\nwords, seeing that the stream of light from my lantern, and that from\r\nSimson’s taper, lay broad and clear, without a shadow, without the\r\nsmallest break, across the entire breadth of the grass. I had ceased even\r\nto be alarmed, for my part. My heart was rent with pity and\r\ntrouble,--pity for the poor suffering human creature that moaned and\r\npleaded so, and trouble for myself and my boy. God! if I could not find\r\nany help,--and what help could I find?--Roland would die.\r\n\r\nWe were all perfectly still till the first outburst was exhausted, as I\r\nknew, by experience, it would be. Dr. Moncrieff, to whom it was new, was\r\nquite motionless on the other side of the wall, as we were in our places.\r\nMy heart had remained almost at its usual beating during the voice. I was\r\nused to it; it did not rouse all my pulses as it did at first. But just\r\nas it threw itself sobbing at the door (I cannot use other words), there\r\nsuddenly came something which sent the blood coursing through my veins,\r\nand my heart into my mouth. It was a voice inside the wall,--the\r\nminister’s well-known voice. I would have been prepared for it in any\r\nkind of adjuration, but I was not prepared for what I heard. It came out\r\nwith a sort of stammering, as if too much moved for utterance. “Willie,\r\nWillie! Oh, God preserve us! is it you?”\r\n\r\nThese simple words had an effect upon me that the voice of the\r\ninvisible creature had ceased to have. I thought the old man, whom I\r\nhad brought into this danger, had gone mad with terror. I made a dash\r\nround to the other side of the wall, half crazed myself with the\r\nthought. He was standing where I had left him, his shadow thrown vague\r\nand large upon the grass by the lantern which stood at his feet. I\r\nlifted my own light to see his face as I rushed forward. He was very\r\npale, his eyes wet and glistening, his mouth quivering with parted\r\nlips. He neither saw nor heard me. We that had gone through this\r\nexperience before, had crouched towards each other to get a little\r\nstrength to bear it. But he was not even aware that I was there. His\r\nwhole being seemed absorbed in anxiety and tenderness. He held out his\r\nhands, which trembled, but it seemed to me with eagerness, not fear. He\r\nwent on speaking all the time. “Willie, if it is you,--and it’s you, if\r\nit is not a delusion of Satan,--Willie, lad! why come ye here frighting\r\nthem that know you not? Why came ye not to me?”\r\n\r\nHe seemed to wait for an answer. When his voice ceased, his countenance,\r\nevery line moving, continued to speak. Simson gave me another terrible\r\nshock, stealing into the open door-way with his light, as much\r\nawe-stricken, as wildly curious, as I. But the minister resumed, without\r\nseeing Simson, speaking to some one else. His voice took a tone of\r\nexpostulation:--\r\n\r\n“Is this right to come here? Your mother’s gone with your name on her\r\nlips. Do you think she would ever close her door on her own lad? Do ye\r\nthink the Lord will close the door, ye faint-hearted creature? No!--I\r\nforbid ye! I forbid ye!” cried the old man. The sobbing voice had begun\r\nto resume its cries. He made a step forward, calling out the last words\r\nin a voice of command. “I forbid ye! Cry out no more to man. Go home, ye\r\nwandering spirit! go home! Do you hear me?--me that christened ye, that\r\nhave struggled with ye, that have wrestled for ye with the Lord!” Here\r\nthe loud tones of his voice sank into tenderness. “And her too, poor\r\nwoman! poor woman! her you are calling upon. She’s not here. You’ll find\r\nher with the Lord. Go there and seek her, not here. Do you hear me, lad?\r\ngo after her there. He’ll let you in, though it’s late. Man, take heart!\r\nif you will lie and sob and greet, let it be at heaven’s gate, and not\r\nyour poor mother’s ruined door.”\r\n\r\nHe stopped to get his breath; and the voice had stopped, not as it had\r\ndone before, when its time was exhausted and all its repetitions said,\r\nbut with a sobbing catch in the breath as if overruled. Then the\r\nminister spoke again, “Are you hearing me, Will? Oh, laddie, you’ve liked\r\nthe beggarly elements all your days. Be done with them now. Go home to\r\nthe Father--the Father! Are you hearing me?” Here the old man sank down\r\nupon his knees, his face raised upwards, his hands held up with a tremble\r\nin them, all white in the light in the midst of the darkness. I resisted\r\nas long as I could, though I cannot tell why; then I, too, dropped upon\r\nmy knees. Simson all the time stood in the door-way, with an expression\r\nin his face such as words could not tell, his under lip dropped, his eyes\r\nwild, staring. It seemed to be to him, that image of blank ignorance and\r\nwonder, that we were praying. All the time the voice, with a low arrested\r\nsobbing, lay just where he was standing, as I thought.\r\n\r\n“Lord,” the minister said,--“Lord, take him into Thy everlasting\r\nhabitations. The mother he cries to is with Thee. Who can open to him but\r\nThee? Lord, when is it too late for Thee, or what is too hard for Thee?\r\nLord, let that woman there draw him inower! Let her draw him inower!”\r\n\r\nI sprang forward to catch something in my arms that flung itself wildly\r\nwithin the door. The illusion was so strong, that I never paused till I\r\nfelt my forehead graze against the wall and my hands clutch the\r\nground,--for there was nobody there to save from falling, as in my\r\nfoolishness I thought. Simson held out his hand to me to help me up. He\r\nwas trembling and cold, his lower lip hanging, his speech almost\r\ninarticulate. “It’s gone,” he said, stammering,--“it’s gone!” We leaned\r\nupon each other for a moment, trembling so much, both of us, that the\r\nwhole scene trembled as if it were going to dissolve and disappear; and\r\nyet as long as I live I will never forget it,--the shining of the\r\nstrange lights, the blackness all round, the kneeling figure with all\r\nthe whiteness of the light concentrated on its white venerable head and\r\nuplifted hands. A strange solemn stillness seemed to close all round us.\r\nBy intervals a single syllable, “Lord! Lord!” came from the old\r\nminister’s lips. He saw none of us, nor thought of us. I never knew how\r\nlong we stood, like sentinels guarding him at his prayers, holding our\r\nlights in a confused dazed way, not knowing what we did. But at last he\r\nrose from his knees, and standing up at his full height, raised his\r\narms, as the Scotch manner is at the end of a religious service, and\r\nsolemnly gave the apostolical benediction,--to what? to the silent\r\nearth, the dark woods, the wide breathing atmosphere; for we were but\r\nspectators gasping an Amen!\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me that it must be the middle of the night, as we all walked\r\nback. It was in reality very late. Dr. Moncrieff put his arm into mine.\r\nHe walked slowly, with an air of exhaustion. It was as if we were coming\r\nfrom a death-bed. Something hushed and solemnized the very air. There was\r\nthat sense of relief in it which there always is at the end of a\r\ndeath-struggle. And nature, persistent, never daunted, came back in all\r\nof us, as we returned into the ways of life. We said nothing to each\r\nother, indeed, for a time; but when we got clear of the trees and\r\nreached the opening near the house, where we could see the sky, Dr.\r\nMoncrieff himself was the first to speak. “I must be going,” he said;\r\n“it’s very late, I’m afraid. I will go down the glen, as I came.”\r\n\r\n“But not alone. I am going with you, Doctor.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I will not oppose it. I am an old man, and agitation wearies more\r\nthan work. Yes; I’ll be thankful of your arm. To-night, Colonel, you’ve\r\ndone me more good turns than one.”\r\n\r\nI pressed his hand on my arm, not feeling able to speak. But Simson,\r\nwho turned with us, and who had gone along all this time with his taper\r\nflaring, in entire unconsciousness, came to himself, apparently at the\r\nsound of our voices, and put out that wild little torch with a quick\r\nmovement, as if of shame. “Let me carry your lantern,” he said; “it is\r\nheavy.” He recovered with a spring; and in a moment, from the\r\nawe-stricken spectator he had been, became himself, sceptical and\r\ncynical. “I should like to ask you a question,” he said. “Do you\r\nbelieve in Purgatory, Doctor? It’s not in the tenets of the Church, so\r\nfar as I know.”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said Dr. Moncrieff, “an old man like me is sometimes not very\r\nsure what he believes. There is just one thing I am certain of--and that\r\nis the loving-kindness of God.”\r\n\r\n“But I thought that was in this life. I am no theologian--”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said the old man again, with a tremor in him which I could feel\r\ngoing over all his frame, “if I saw a friend of mine within the gates of\r\nhell, I would not despair but his Father would take him by the hand\r\nstill, if he cried like _you_.”\r\n\r\n“I allow it is very strange, very strange. I cannot see through it. That\r\nthere must be human agency, I feel sure. Doctor, what made you decide\r\nupon the person and the name?”\r\n\r\nThe minister put out his hand with the impatience which a man might show\r\nif he were asked how he recognized his brother. “Tuts!” he said, in\r\nfamiliar speech; then more solemnly, “How should I not recognize a person\r\nthat I know better--far better--than I know you?”\r\n\r\n“Then you saw the man?”\r\n\r\nDr. Moncrieff made no reply. He moved his hand again with a little\r\nimpatient movement, and walked on, leaning heavily on my arm. And we went\r\non for a long time without another word, threading the dark paths, which\r\nwere steep and slippery with the damp of the winter. The air was very\r\nstill,--not more than enough to make a faint sighing in the branches,\r\nwhich mingled with the sound of the water to which we were descending.\r\nWhen we spoke again, it was about indifferent matters,--about the height\r\nof the river, and the recent rains. We parted with the minister at his\r\nown door, where his old housekeeper appeared in great perturbation,\r\nwaiting for him. “Eh, me, minister! the young gentleman will be worse?”\r\nshe cried.\r\n\r\n“Far from that--better. God bless him!” Dr. Moncrieff said.\r\n\r\nI think if Simson had begun again to me with his questions, I should have\r\npitched him over the rocks as we returned up the glen; but he was silent,\r\nby a good inspiration. And the sky was clearer than it had been for many\r\nnights, shining high over the trees, with here and there a star faintly\r\ngleaming through the wilderness of dark and bare branches. The air, as I\r\nhave said, was very soft in them, with a subdued and peaceful cadence. It\r\nwas real, like every natural sound, and came to us like a hush of peace\r\nand relief. I thought there was a sound in it as of the breath of a\r\nsleeper, and it seemed clear to me that Roland must be sleeping,\r\nsatisfied and calm. We went up to his room when we went in. There we\r\nfound the complete hush of rest. My wife looked up out of a doze, and\r\ngave me a smile: “I think he is a great deal better; but you are very\r\nlate,” she said in a whisper, shading the light with her hand that the\r\nDoctor might see his patient. The boy had got back something like his own\r\ncolor. He woke as we stood all round his bed. His eyes had the happy,\r\nhalf-awakened look of childhood, glad to shut again, yet pleased with the\r\ninterruption and glimmer of the light. I stooped over him and kissed his\r\nforehead, which was moist and cool. “All is well, Roland,” I said. He\r\nlooked up at me with a glance of pleasure, and took my hand and laid his\r\ncheek upon it, and so went to sleep.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor some nights after, I watched among the ruins, spending all the dark\r\nhours up to midnight patrolling about the bit of wall which was\r\nassociated with so many emotions; but I heard nothing, and saw nothing\r\nbeyond the quiet course of nature; nor, so far as I am aware, has\r\nanything been heard again. Dr. Moncrieff gave me the history of the\r\nyouth, whom he never hesitated to name. I did not ask, as Simson did, how\r\nhe recognized him. He had been a prodigal,--weak, foolish, easily imposed\r\nupon, and “led away,” as people say. All that we had heard had passed\r\nactually in life, the Doctor said. The young man had come home thus a day\r\nor two after his mother died,--who was no more than the housekeeper in\r\nthe old house,--and distracted with the news, had thrown himself down at\r\nthe door and called upon her to let him in. The old man could scarcely\r\nspeak of it for tears. To me it seemed as if--Heaven help us, how little\r\ndo we know about anything!--a scene like that might impress itself\r\nsomehow upon the hidden heart of nature. I do not pretend to know how,\r\nbut the repetition had struck me at the time as, in its terrible\r\nstrangeness and incomprehensibility, almost mechanical,--as if the unseen\r\nactor could not exceed or vary, but was bound to re-enact the whole. One\r\nthing that struck me, however, greatly, was the likeness between the old\r\nminister and my boy in the manner of regarding these strange phenomena.\r\nDr. Moncrieff was not terrified, as I had been myself, and all the rest\r\nof us. It was no “ghost,” as I fear we all vulgarly considered it, to\r\nhim,--but a poor creature whom he knew under these conditions, just as\r\nhe had known him in the flesh, having no doubt of his identity. And to\r\nRoland it was the same. This spirit in pain,--if it was a spirit,--this\r\nvoice out of the unseen,--was a poor fellow-creature in misery, to be\r\nsuccored and helped out of his trouble, to my boy. He spoke to me quite\r\nfrankly about it when he got better. “I knew father would find out some\r\nway,” he said. And this was when he was strong and well, and all idea\r\nthat he would turn hysterical or become a seer of visions had happily\r\npassed away.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI must add one curious fact, which does not seem to me to have any\r\nrelation to the above, but which Simson made great use of, as the human\r\nagency which he was determined to find somehow. We had examined the ruins\r\nvery closely at the time of these occurrences; but afterwards, when all\r\nwas over, as we went casually about them one Sunday afternoon in the\r\nidleness of that unemployed day, Simson with his stick penetrated an old\r\nwindow which had been entirely blocked up with fallen soil. He jumped\r\ndown into it in great excitement, and called me to follow. There we found\r\na little hole,--for it was more a hole than a room,--entirely hidden\r\nunder the ivy and ruins, in which there was a quantity of straw laid in a\r\ncorner, as if some one had made a bed there, and some remains of crusts\r\nabout the floor. Some one had lodged there, and not very long before, he\r\nmade out; and that this unknown being was the author of all the\r\nmysterious sounds we heard he is convinced. “I told you it was human\r\nagency,” he said triumphantly. He forgets, I suppose, how he and I stood\r\nwith our lights, seeing nothing, while the space between us was audibly\r\ntraversed by something that could speak, and sob, and suffer. There is no\r\nargument with men of this kind. He is ready to get up a laugh against me\r\non this slender ground. “I was puzzled myself,--I could not make it\r\nout,--but I always felt convinced human agency was at the bottom of it.\r\nAnd here it is,--and a clever fellow he must have been,” the Doctor says.\r\n\r\nBagley left my service as soon as he got well. He assured me it was no\r\nwant of respect, but he could not stand “them kind of things;” and the\r\nman was so shaken and ghastly that I was glad to give him a present and\r\nlet him go. For my own part, I made a point of staying out the\r\ntime--two years--for which I had taken Brentwood; but I did not renew\r\nmy tenancy. By that time we had settled, and found for ourselves a\r\npleasant home of our own.\r\n\r\nI must add, that when the Doctor defies me, I can always bring back\r\ngravity to his countenance, and a pause in his railing, when I remind him\r\nof the juniper-bush. To me that was a matter of little importance. I\r\ncould believe I was mistaken. I did not care about it one way or other;\r\nbut on his mind the effect was different. The miserable voice, the spirit\r\nin pain, he could think of as the result of ventriloquism, or\r\nreverberation, or--anything you please: an elaborate prolonged hoax,\r\nexecuted somehow by the tramp that had found a lodging in the old tower;\r\nbut the juniper-bush staggered him. Things have effects so different on\r\nthe minds of different men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTHE PORTRAIT\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the period when the following incidents occurred, I was living with my\r\nfather at The Grove, a large old house in the immediate neighborhood of a\r\nlittle town. This had been his home for a number of years; and I believe\r\nI was born in it. It was a kind of house which, notwithstanding all the\r\nred and white architecture known at present by the name of Queen Anne,\r\nbuilders nowadays have forgotten how to build. It was straggling and\r\nirregular, with wide passages, wide staircases, broad landings; the rooms\r\nlarge but not very lofty; the arrangements leaving much to be desired,\r\nwith no economy of space; a house belonging to a period when land was\r\ncheap, and, so far as that was concerned, there was no occasion to\r\neconomize. Though it was so near the town, the clump of trees in which it\r\nwas environed was a veritable grove. In the grounds in spring the\r\nprimroses grew as thickly as in the forest. We had a few fields for the\r\ncows, and an excellent walled garden. The place is being pulled down at\r\nthis moment to make room for more streets of mean little houses,--the\r\nkind of thing, and not a dull house of faded gentry, which perhaps the\r\nneighborhood requires. The house was dull, and so were we, its last\r\ninhabitants; and the furniture was faded, even a little dingy,--nothing\r\nto brag of. I do not, however, intend to convey a suggestion that we were\r\nfaded gentry, for that was not the case. My father, indeed, was rich, and\r\nhad no need to spare any expense in making his life and his house bright\r\nif he pleased; but he did not please, and I had not been long enough at\r\nhome to exercise any special influence of my own. It was the only home I\r\nhad ever known; but except in my earliest childhood, and in my holidays\r\nas a schoolboy, I had in reality known but little of it. My mother had\r\ndied at my birth, or shortly after, and I had grown up in the gravity and\r\nsilence of a house without women. In my infancy, I believe, a sister of\r\nmy father’s had lived with us, and taken charge of the household and of\r\nme; but she, too, had died long, long ago, my mourning for her being one\r\nof the first things I could recollect. And she had no successor. There\r\nwere, indeed, a housekeeper and some maids,--the latter of whom I only\r\nsaw disappearing at the end of a passage, or whisking out of a room when\r\none of “the gentlemen” appeared. Mrs. Weir, indeed, I saw nearly every\r\nday; but a curtsey, a smile, a pair of nice round arms which she caressed\r\nwhile folding them across her ample waist, and a large white apron, were\r\nall I knew of her. This was the only female influence in the house. The\r\ndrawing-room I was aware of only as a place of deadly good order, into\r\nwhich nobody ever entered. It had three long windows opening on the lawn,\r\nand communicated at the upper end, which was rounded like a great bay,\r\nwith the conservatory. Sometimes I gazed into it as a child from without,\r\nwondering at the needlework on the chairs, the screens, the\r\nlooking-glasses which never reflected any living face. My father did not\r\nlike the room, which probably was not wonderful, though it never occurred\r\nto me in those early days to inquire why.\r\n\r\nI may say here, though it will probably be disappointing to those who\r\nform a sentimental idea of the capabilities of children, that it did\r\nnot occur to me either, in these early days, to make any inquiry about\r\nmy mother. There was no room in life, as I knew it, for any such\r\nperson; nothing suggested to my mind either the fact that she must have\r\nexisted, or that there was need of her in the house. I accepted, as I\r\nbelieve most children do, the facts of existence, on the basis with\r\nwhich I had first made acquaintance with them, without question or\r\nremark. As a matter of fact, I was aware that it was rather dull at\r\nhome; but neither by comparison with the books I read, nor by the\r\ncommunications received from my school-fellows, did this seem to me\r\nanything remarkable. And I was possibly somewhat dull too by nature,\r\nfor I did not mind. I was fond of reading, and for that there was\r\nunbounded opportunity. I had a little ambition in respect to work, and\r\nthat too could be prosecuted undisturbed. When I went to the\r\nuniversity, my society lay almost entirely among men; but by that time\r\nand afterwards, matters had of course greatly changed with me, and\r\nthough I recognized women as part of the economy of nature, and did not\r\nindeed by any means dislike or avoid them, yet the idea of connecting\r\nthem at all with my own home never entered into my head. That continued\r\nto be as it had always been, when at intervals I descended upon the\r\ncool, grave, colorless place, in the midst of my traffic with the\r\nworld: always very still, well-ordered, serious,--the cooking very\r\ngood, the comfort perfect; old Morphew, the butler, a little older (but\r\nvery little older, perhaps on the whole less old, since in my childhood\r\nI had thought him a kind of Methuselah); and Mrs. Weir, less active,\r\ncovering up her arms in sleeves, but folding and caressing them just as\r\nalways. I remember looking in from the lawn through the windows upon\r\nthat deadly-orderly drawing-room, with a humorous recollection of my\r\nchildish admiration and wonder, and feeling that it must be kept so\r\nforever and ever, and that to go into it would break some sort of\r\namusing mock mystery, some pleasantly ridiculous spell.\r\n\r\nBut it was only at rare intervals that I went home. In the long vacation,\r\nas in my school holidays, my father often went abroad with me, so that we\r\nhad gone over a great deal of the Continent together very pleasantly. He\r\nwas old in proportion to the age of his son, being a man of sixty when I\r\nwas twenty, but that did not disturb the pleasure of the relations\r\nbetween us. I don’t know that they were ever very confidential. On my\r\nside there was but little to communicate, for I did not get into scrapes\r\nnor fall in love, the two predicaments which demand sympathy and\r\nconfidences. And as for my father himself, I was never aware what there\r\ncould be to communicate on his side. I knew his life exactly,--what he\r\ndid almost at every hour of the day; under what circumstances of the\r\ntemperature he would ride and when walk; how often and with what guests\r\nhe would indulge in the occasional break of a dinner-party, a serious\r\npleasure,--perhaps, indeed, less a pleasure than a duty. All this I knew\r\nas well as he did, and also his views on public matters, his political\r\nopinions, which naturally were different from mine. What ground, then,\r\nremained for confidence? I did not know any. We were both of us of a\r\nreserved nature, not apt to enter into our religious feelings, for\r\ninstance. There are many people who think reticence on such subjects a\r\nsign of the most reverential way of contemplating them. Of this I am far\r\nfrom being sure; but, at all events, it was the practice most congenial\r\nto my own mind.\r\n\r\nAnd then I was for a long time absent, making my own way in the world. I\r\ndid not make it very successfully. I accomplished the natural fate of an\r\nEnglishman, and went out to the Colonies; then to India in a\r\nsemi-diplomatic position; but returned home after seven or eight years,\r\ninvalided, in bad health and not much better spirits, tired and\r\ndisappointed with my first trial of life. I had, as people say, “no\r\noccasion” to insist on making my way. My father was rich, and had never\r\ngiven me the slightest reason to believe that he did not intend me to be\r\nhis heir. His allowance to me was not illiberal, and though he did not\r\noppose the carrying out of my own plans, he by no means urged me to\r\nexertion. When I came home he received me very affectionately, and\r\nexpressed his satisfaction in my return. “Of course,” he said, “I am not\r\nglad that you are disappointed, Philip, or that your health is broken;\r\nbut otherwise it is an ill wind, you know, that blows nobody good; and I\r\nam very glad to have you at home. I am growing an old man--”\r\n\r\n“I don’t see any difference, sir,” said I; “everything here seems exactly\r\nthe same as when I went away--”\r\n\r\nHe smiled, and shook his head. “It is true enough,” he said; “after we\r\nhave reached a certain age we seem to go on for a long time on a\r\nplane, and feel no great difference from year to year; but it is an\r\ninclined plane, and the longer we go on the more sudden will be the\r\nfall at the end. But at all events it will be a great comfort to me to\r\nhave you here.”\r\n\r\n“If I had known that,” I said, “and that you wanted me, I should have\r\ncome in any circumstances. As there are only two of us in the world--”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said, “there are only two of us in the world; but still I\r\nshould not have sent for you, Phil, to interrupt your career.”\r\n\r\n“It is as well, then, that it has interrupted itself,” I said rather\r\nbitterly; for disappointment is hard to bear.\r\n\r\nHe patted me on the shoulder, and repeated, “It is an ill wind that blows\r\nnobody good,” with a look of real pleasure which gave me a certain\r\ngratification too; for, after all, he was an old man, and the only one in\r\nall the world to whom I owed any duty. I had not been without dreams of\r\nwarmer affections, but they had come to nothing--not tragically, but in\r\nthe ordinary way. I might perhaps have had love which I did not want but\r\nnot that which I did want,--which was not a thing to make any unmanly\r\nmoan about, but in the ordinary course of events. Such disappointments\r\nhappen every day; indeed, they are more common than anything else, and\r\nsometimes it is apparent afterwards that it is better it was so.\r\n\r\nHowever, here I was at thirty stranded, yet wanting for nothing,--in a\r\nposition to call forth rather envy than pity from the greater part of my\r\ncontemporaries; for I had an assured and comfortable existence, as much\r\nmoney as I wanted, and the prospect of an excellent fortune for the\r\nfuture. On the other hand, my health was still low, and I had no\r\noccupation. The neighborhood of the town was a drawback rather than an\r\nadvantage. I felt myself tempted, instead of taking the long walk into\r\nthe country which my doctor recommended, to take a much shorter one\r\nthrough the High Street, across the river, and back again, which was\r\nnot a walk but a lounge. The country was silent and full of\r\nthoughts,--thoughts not always very agreeable,--whereas there were always\r\nthe humors of the little urban population to glance at, the news to be\r\nheard,--all those petty matters which so often make up life in a very\r\nimpoverished version for the idle man. I did not like it, but I felt\r\nmyself yielding to it, not having energy enough to make a stand. The\r\nrector and the leading lawyer of the place asked me to dinner. I might\r\nhave glided into the society, such as it was, had I been disposed for\r\nthat; everything about me began to close over me as if I had been fifty,\r\nand fully contented with my lot.\r\n\r\nIt was possibly my own want of occupation which made me observe with\r\nsurprise, after a while, how much occupied my father was. He had\r\nexpressed himself glad of my return; but now that I had returned, I saw\r\nvery little of him. Most of his time was spent in his library, as had\r\nalways been the case. But on the few visits I paid him there, I could not\r\nbut perceive that the aspect of the library was much changed. It had\r\nacquired the look of a business-room, almost an office. There were large\r\nbusiness-like books on the table, which I could not associate with\r\nanything he could naturally have to do; and his correspondence was very\r\nlarge. I thought he closed one of those books hurriedly as I came in, and\r\npushed it away, as if he did not wish me to see it. This surprised me at\r\nthe moment without arousing any other feeling; but afterwards I\r\nremembered it with a clearer sense of what it meant. He was more absorbed\r\naltogether than I had been used to see him. He was visited by men\r\nsometimes not of very prepossessing appearance. Surprise grew in my mind\r\nwithout any very distinct idea of the reason of it; and it was not till\r\nafter a chance conversation with Morphew that my vague uneasiness began\r\nto take definite shape. It was begun without any special intention on my\r\npart. Morphew had informed me that master was very busy, on some occasion\r\nwhen I wanted to see him. And I was a little annoyed to be thus put off.\r\n“It appears to me that my father is always busy,” I said hastily. Morphew\r\nthen began very oracularly to nod his head in assent.\r\n\r\n“A deal too busy, sir, if you take my opinion,” he said.\r\n\r\nThis startled me much, and I asked hurriedly, “What do you mean?” without\r\nreflecting that to ask for private information from a servant about my\r\nfather’s habits was as bad as investigating into a stranger’s affairs. It\r\ndid not strike me in the same light.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Philip,” said Morphew, “a thing ’as ’appened as ’appens more often\r\nthan it ought to. Master has got awful keen about money in his old age.”\r\n\r\n“That’s a new thing for him,” I said.\r\n\r\n“No, sir, begging your pardon, it ain’t a new thing. He was once\r\nbroke of it, and that wasn’t easy done; but it’s come back, if you’ll\r\nexcuse me saying so. And I don’t know as he’ll ever be broke of it\r\nagain at his age.”\r\n\r\nI felt more disposed to be angry than disturbed by this. “You must be\r\nmaking some ridiculous mistake,” I said. “And if you were not so old a\r\nfriend as you are, Morphew, I should not have allowed my father to be so\r\nspoken of to me.”\r\n\r\nThe old man gave me a half-astonished, half-contemptuous look. “He’s been\r\nmy master a deal longer than he’s been your father,” he said, turning on\r\nhis heel. The assumption was so comical that my anger could not stand in\r\nface of it. I went out, having been on my way to the door when this\r\nconversation occurred, and took my usual lounge about, which was not a\r\nsatisfactory sort of amusement. Its vanity and emptiness appeared to be\r\nmore evident than usual to-day. I met half-a-dozen people I knew, and had\r\nas many pieces of news confided to me. I went up and down the length of\r\nthe High Street. I made a small purchase or two. And then I turned\r\nhomeward, despising myself, yet finding no alternative within my reach.\r\nWould a long country walk have been more virtuous? It would at least have\r\nbeen more wholesome; but that was all that could be said. My mind did\r\nnot dwell on Morphew’s communication. It seemed without sense or meaning\r\nto me; and after the excellent joke about his superior interest in his\r\nmaster to mine in my father, was dismissed lightly enough from my mind. I\r\ntried to invent some way of telling this to my father without letting him\r\nperceive that Morphew had been finding faults in him, or I listening; for\r\nit seemed a pity to lose so good a joke. However, as I returned home,\r\nsomething happened which put the joke entirely out of my head. It is\r\ncurious when a new subject of trouble or anxiety has been suggested to\r\nthe mind in an unexpected way, how often a second advertisement follows\r\nimmediately after the first, and gives to that a potency which in itself\r\nit had not possessed.\r\n\r\nI was approaching our own door, wondering whether my father had gone, and\r\nwhether, on my return, I should find him at leisure,--for I had several\r\nlittle things to say to him,--when I noticed a poor woman lingering about\r\nthe closed gates. She had a baby sleeping in her arms. It was a spring\r\nnight, the stars shining in the twilight, and everything soft and dim;\r\nand the woman’s figure was like a shadow, flitting about, now here, now\r\nthere, on one side or another of the gate. She stopped when she saw me\r\napproaching, and hesitated for a moment, then seemed to take a sudden\r\nresolution. I watched her without knowing, with a prevision that she was\r\ngoing to address me, though with no sort of idea as to the subject of her\r\naddress. She came up to me doubtfully, it seemed, yet certainly, as I\r\nfelt, and when she was close to me, dropped a sort of hesitating curtsey,\r\nand said, “It’s Mr. Philip?” in a low voice.\r\n\r\n“What do you want with me?” I said.\r\n\r\nThen she poured forth suddenly, without warning or preparation, her long\r\nspeech,--a flood of words which must have been all ready and waiting at\r\nthe doors of her lips for utterance. “Oh, sir, I want to speak to you! I\r\ncan’t believe you’ll be so hard, for you’re young; and I can’t believe\r\nhe’ll be so hard if so be as his own son, as I’ve always heard he had but\r\none, ’ll speak up for us. Oh, gentleman, it is easy for the likes of you,\r\nthat, if you ain’t comfortable in one room, can just walk into another;\r\nbut if one room is all you have, and every bit of furniture you have\r\ntaken out of it, and nothing but the four walls left,--not so much as the\r\ncradle for the child, or a chair for your man to sit down upon when he\r\ncomes from his work, or a saucepan to cook him his supper--”\r\n\r\n“My good woman,” I said, “who can have taken all that from you? Surely\r\nnobody can be so cruel?”\r\n\r\n“You say it’s cruel!” she cried with a sort of triumph. “Oh, I knowed you\r\nwould, or any true gentleman that don’t hold with screwing poor folks.\r\nJust go and say that to him inside there for the love of God. Tell him\r\nto think what he’s doing, driving poor creatures to despair. Summer’s\r\ncoming, the Lord be praised, but yet it’s bitter cold at night with your\r\ncounterpane gone; and when you’ve been working hard all day, and nothing\r\nbut four bare walls to come home to, and all your poor little sticks of\r\nfurniture that you’ve saved up for, and got together one by one, all\r\ngone, and you no better than when you started, or rather worse, for then\r\nyou was young. Oh, sir!” the woman’s voice rose into a sort of passionate\r\nwail. And then she added, beseechingly, recovering herself, “Oh, speak\r\nfor us; he’ll not refuse his own son--”\r\n\r\n“To whom am I to speak? Who is it that has done this to you?” I said.\r\n\r\nThe woman hesitated again, looking keenly in my face, then repeated with\r\na slight faltering, “It’s Mr. Philip?” as if that made everything right.\r\n\r\n“Yes; I am Philip Canning,” I said; “but what have I to do with this?\r\nand to whom am I to speak?”\r\n\r\nShe began to whimper, crying and stopping herself. “Oh, please, sir! it’s\r\nMr. Canning as owns all the house property about; it’s him that our court\r\nand the lane and everything belongs to. And he’s taken the bed from under\r\nus, and the baby’s cradle, although it’s said in the Bible as you’re not\r\nto take poor folks’ bed.”\r\n\r\n“My father!” I cried in spite of myself; “then it must be some agent,\r\nsome one else in his name. You may be sure he knows nothing of it. Of\r\ncourse I shall speak to him at once.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, God bless you, sir,” said the woman. But then she added, in a lower\r\ntone, “It’s no agent. It’s one as never knows trouble. It’s him that\r\nlives in that grand house.” But this was said under her breath, evidently\r\nnot for me to hear.\r\n\r\nMorphew’s words flashed through my mind as she spoke. What was this? Did\r\nit afford an explanation of the much-occupied hours, the big books, the\r\nstrange visitors? I took the poor woman’s name, and gave her something\r\nto procure a few comforts for the night, and went indoors disturbed and\r\ntroubled. It was impossible to believe that my father himself would\r\nhave acted thus; but he was not a man to brook interference, and I did\r\nnot see how to introduce the subject, what to say. I could but hope\r\nthat, at the moment of broaching it, words would be put into my mouth,\r\nwhich often happens in moments of necessity, one knows not how, even\r\nwhen one’s theme is not so all-important as that for which such help has\r\nbeen promised. As usual, I did not see my father till dinner. I have\r\nsaid that our dinners were very good, luxurious in a simple way,\r\neverything excellent in its kind, well cooked, well served,--the\r\nperfection of comfort without show,--which is a combination very dear to\r\nthe English heart. I said nothing till Morphew, with his solemn\r\nattention to everything that was going, had retired; and then it was\r\nwith some strain of courage that I began.\r\n\r\n“I was stopped outside the gate to-day by a curious sort of\r\npetitioner,--a poor woman, who seems to be one of your tenants, sir, but\r\nwhom your agent must have been rather too hard upon.”\r\n\r\n“My agent? Who is that?” said my father quietly.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know his name, and I doubt his competence. The poor creature\r\nseems to have had everything taken from her,--her bed, her child’s\r\ncradle.”\r\n\r\n“No doubt she was behind with her rent.”\r\n\r\n“Very likely, sir. She seemed very poor,” said I.\r\n\r\n“You take it coolly,” said my father, with an upward glance, half-amused,\r\nnot in the least shocked by my statement. “But when a man, or a woman\r\neither, takes a house, I suppose you will allow that they ought to pay\r\nrent for it.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly, sir,” I replied, “when they have got anything to pay.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t allow the reservation,” he said. But he was not angry, which I\r\nhad feared he would be.\r\n\r\n“I think,” I continued, “that your agent must be too severe. And this\r\nemboldens me to say something which has been in my mind for some\r\ntime”--(these were the words, no doubt, which I had hoped would be put\r\ninto my month; they were the suggestion of the moment, and yet as I said\r\nthem it was with the most complete conviction of their truth)--“and that\r\nis this: I am doing nothing; my time hangs heavy on my hands. Make me\r\nyour agent. I will see for myself, and save you from such mistakes; and\r\nit will be an occupation--”\r\n\r\n“Mistakes? What warrant have you for saying these are mistakes?” he said\r\ntestily; then after a moment: “This is a strange proposal from you, Phil.\r\nDo you know what it is you are offering?--to be a collector of rents,\r\ngoing about from door to door, from week to week; to look after wretched\r\nlittle bits of repairs, drains, etc.; to get paid, which, after all, is\r\nthe chief thing, and not to be taken in by tales of poverty.”\r\n\r\n“Not to let you be taken in by men without pity,” I said.\r\n\r\nHe gave me a strange glance, which I did not very well understand, and\r\nsaid abruptly, a thing which, so far as I remember, he had never in my\r\nlife said before, “You’ve become a little like your mother, Phil--”\r\n\r\n“My mother!” the reference was so unusual--nay, so unprecedented--that I\r\nwas greatly startled. It seemed to me like the sudden introduction of a\r\nquite new element in the stagnant atmosphere, as well as a new party to\r\nour conversation. My father looked across the table, as if with some\r\nastonishment at my tone of surprise.\r\n\r\n“Is that so very extraordinary?” he said.\r\n\r\n“No; of course it is not extraordinary that I should resemble my mother.\r\nOnly--I have heard very little of her--almost nothing.”\r\n\r\n“That is true.” He got up and placed himself before the fire, which was\r\nvery low, as the night was not cold--had not been cold heretofore at\r\nleast; but it seemed to me now that a little chill came into the dim and\r\nfaded room. Perhaps it looked more dull from the suggestion of a\r\nsomething brighter, warmer, that might have been. “Talking of mistakes,”\r\nhe said, “perhaps that was one: to sever you entirely from her side of\r\nthe house. But I did not care for the connection. You will understand how\r\nit is that I speak of it now when I tell you--” He stopped here, however,\r\nsaid nothing more for a minute or so, and then rang the bell. Morphew\r\ncame, as he always did, very deliberately, so that some time elapsed in\r\nsilence, during which my surprise grew. When the old man appeared at the\r\ndoor--“Have you put the lights in the drawing-room, as I told you?” my\r\nfather said.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir; and opened the box, sir; and it’s a--it’s a speaking\r\nlikeness--”\r\n\r\nThis the old man got out in a great hurry, as if afraid that his master\r\nwould stop him. My father did so with a wave of his hand.\r\n\r\n“That’s enough. I asked no information. You can go now.”\r\n\r\nThe door closed upon us, and there was again a pause. My subject had\r\nfloated away altogether like a mist, though I had been so concerned about\r\nit. I tried to resume, but could not. Something seemed to arrest my very\r\nbreathing; and yet in this dull, respectable house of ours, where\r\neverything breathed good character and integrity, it was certain that\r\nthere could be no shameful mystery to reveal. It was some time before my\r\nfather spoke, not from any purpose that I could see, but apparently\r\nbecause his mind was busy with probably unaccustomed thoughts.\r\n\r\n“You scarcely know the drawing-room, Phil,” he said at last.\r\n\r\n“Very little. I have never seen it used. I have a little awe of it, to\r\ntell the truth.”\r\n\r\n“That should not be. There is no reason for that. But a man by himself,\r\nas I have been for the greater part of my life, has no occasion for a\r\ndrawing-room. I always, as a matter of preference, sat among my books;\r\nhowever, I ought to have thought of the impression on you.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, it is not important,” I said; “the awe was childish. I have not\r\nthought of it since I came home.”\r\n\r\n“It never was anything very splendid at the best,” said he. He lifted the\r\nlamp from the table with a sort of abstraction, not remarking even my\r\noffer to take it from him, and led the way. He was on the verge of\r\nseventy, and looked his age; but it was a vigorous age, with no symptom\r\nof giving way. The circle of light from the lamp lit up his white hair\r\nand keen blue eyes and clear complexion; his forehead was like old ivory,\r\nhis cheek warmly colored; an old man, yet a man in full strength. He was\r\ntaller than I was, and still almost as strong. As he stood for a moment\r\nwith the lamp in his hand, he looked like a tower in his great height and\r\nbulk. I reflected as I looked at him that I knew him intimately, more\r\nintimately than any other creature in the world,--I was familiar with\r\nevery detail of his outward life; could it be that in reality I did not\r\nknow him at all?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe drawing-room was already lighted with a flickering array of candles\r\nupon the mantelpiece and along the walls, producing the pretty, starry\r\neffect which candles give without very much light. As I had not the\r\nsmallest idea what I was about to see, for Morphew’s “speaking likeness”\r\nwas very hurriedly said, and only half comprehensible in the bewilderment\r\nof my faculties, my first glance was at this very unusual illumination,\r\nfor which I could assign no reason. The next showed me a large\r\nfull-length portrait, still in the box in which apparently it had\r\ntravelled, placed upright, supported against a table in the centre of the\r\nroom. My father walked straight up to it, motioned to me to place a\r\nsmaller table close to the picture on the left side, and put his lamp\r\nupon that. Then he waved his hand towards it, and stood aside that I\r\nmight see.\r\n\r\nIt was a full-length portrait of a very young woman--I might say a girl\r\nscarcely twenty--in a white dress, made in a very simple old fashion,\r\nthough I was too little accustomed to female costume to be able to fix\r\nthe date. It might have been a hundred years old, or twenty, for aught I\r\nknew. The face had an expression of youth, candor, and simplicity more\r\nthan any face I had ever seen,--or so, at least in my surprise, I\r\nthought. The eyes were a little wistful, with something which was almost\r\nanxiety which at least was not content--in them; a faint, almost\r\nimperceptible, curve in the lids. The complexion was of a dazzling\r\nfairness, the hair light, but the eyes dark, which gave individuality to\r\nthe face. It would have been as lovely had the eyes been blue,--probably\r\nmore so,--but their darkness gave a touch of character, a slight discord,\r\nwhich made the harmony finer. It was not, perhaps, beautiful in the\r\nhighest sense of the word. The girl must have been too young, too slight,\r\ntoo little developed for actual beauty; but a face which so invited love\r\nand confidence I never saw. One smiled at it with instinctive affection.\r\n“What a sweet face!” I said. “What a lovely girl! Who is she? Is this one\r\nof the relations you were speaking of on the other side?”\r\n\r\nMy father made me no reply. He stood aside, looking at it as if he knew\r\nit too well to require to look,--as if the picture was already in his\r\neyes. “Yes,” he said, after an interval, with a long-drawn breath, “she\r\nwas a lovely girl, as you say.”\r\n\r\n“Was?--then she is dead. What a pity!” I said; “what a pity! so young and\r\nso sweet!”\r\n\r\nWe stood gazing at her thus, in her beautiful stillness and calm,--two\r\nmen, the younger of us full-grown and conscious of many experiences, the\r\nother an old man,--before this impersonation of tender youth. At length\r\nhe said, with a slight tremulousness in his voice, “Does nothing suggest\r\nto you who she is, Phil?”\r\n\r\nI turned round to look at him with profound astonishment, but he turned\r\naway from my look. A sort of quiver passed over his face. “That is your\r\nmother,” he said, and walked suddenly away, leaving me there.\r\n\r\nMy mother!\r\n\r\nI stood for a moment in a kind of consternation before the white-robed\r\ninnocent creature, to me no more than a child; then a sudden laugh broke\r\nfrom me, without any will of mine something ludicrous, as well as\r\nsomething awful, was in it. When the laugh was over, I found myself with\r\ntears in my eyes, gazing, holding my breath. The soft features seemed to\r\nmelt, the lips to move, the anxiety in the eyes to become a personal\r\ninquiry. Ah, no! nothing of the kind; only because of the water in mine.\r\nMy mother! oh, fair and gentle creature, scarcely woman, how could any\r\nman’s voice call her by that name! I had little idea enough of what it\r\nmeant,--had heard it laughed at, scoffed at, reverenced, but never had\r\nlearned to place it even among the ideal powers of life. Yet if it meant\r\nanything at all, what it meant was worth thinking of. What did she ask,\r\nlooking at me with those eyes? What would she have said if “those lips\r\nhad language”? If I had known her only as Cowper did--with a child’s\r\nrecollection--there might have been some thread, some faint but\r\ncomprehensible link, between us; but now all that I felt was the curious\r\nincongruity. Poor child! I said to myself; so sweet a creature: poor\r\nlittle tender soul! as if she had been a little sister, a child of\r\nmine,--but my mother! I cannot tell how long I stood looking at her,\r\nstudying the candid, sweet face, which surely had germs in it of\r\neverything that was good and beautiful; and sorry, with a profound\r\nregret, that she had died and never carried these promises to\r\nfulfillment. Poor girl! poor people who had loved her! These were my\r\nthoughts; with a curious vertigo and giddiness of my whole being in the\r\nsense of a mysterious relationship, which it was beyond my power to\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\nPresently my father came back, possibly because I had been a long time\r\nunconscious of the passage of the minutes, or perhaps because he was\r\nhimself restless in the strange disturbance of his habitual calm. He came\r\nin and put his arm within mine, leaning his weight partially upon me,\r\nwith an affectionate suggestion which went deeper than words. I pressed\r\nhis arm to my side: it was more between us two grave Englishmen than any\r\nembracing.\r\n\r\n“I cannot understand it,” I said.\r\n\r\n“No. I don’t wonder at that; but if it is strange to you, Phil, think how\r\nmuch more strange to me! That is the partner of my life. I have never had\r\nanother, or thought of another. That--girl! If we are to meet again, as I\r\nhave always hoped we should meet again, what am I to say to her,--I, an\r\nold man? Yes; I know what you mean. I am not an old man for my years; but\r\nmy years are threescore and ten, and the play is nearly played out. How\r\nam I to meet that young creature? We used to say to each other that it\r\nwas forever, that we never could be but one, that it was for life and\r\ndeath. But what--what am I to say to her, Phil, when I meet her again,\r\nthat--that angel? No, it is not her being an angel that troubles me; but\r\nshe is so young! She is like my--my granddaughter,” he cried, with a\r\nburst of what was half sobs, half laughter; “and she is my wife,--and I\r\nam an old man--an old man! And so much has happened that she could not\r\nunderstand.”\r\n\r\nI was too much startled by this strange complaint to know what to say.\r\nIt was not my own trouble, and I answered it in the conventional way.\r\n\r\n“They are not as we are, sir,” I said; “they look upon us with larger,\r\nother eyes than ours.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! you don’t know what I mean,” he said quickly; and in the interval he\r\nhad subdued his emotion. “At first, after she died, it was my consolation\r\nto think that I should meet her again,--that we never could be really\r\nparted. But, my God, how I have changed since then! I am another man,--I\r\nam a different being. I was not very young even then,--twenty years older\r\nthan she was; but her youth renewed mine. I was not an unfit partner; she\r\nasked no better, and knew as much more than I did in some things,--being\r\nso much nearer the source,--as I did in others that were of the world.\r\nBut I have gone a long way since then, Phil,--a long way; and there she\r\nstands, just where I left her.”\r\n\r\nI pressed his arm again. “Father,” I said, which was a title I seldom\r\nused, “we are not to suppose that in a higher life the mind stands\r\nstill.” I did not feel myself qualified to discuss such topics, but\r\nsomething one must say.\r\n\r\n“Worse, worse!” he replied; “then she too will be, like me, a different\r\nbeing, and we shall meet as what? as strangers, as people who have lost\r\nsight of each other, with a long past between us,--we who parted, my God!\r\nwith--with--”\r\n\r\nHis voice broke and ended for a moment then while, surprised and almost\r\nshocked by what he said, I cast about in my mind what to reply, he\r\nwithdrew his arm suddenly from mine, and said in his usual tone, “Where\r\nshall we hang the picture, Phil? It must be here in this room. What do\r\nyou think will be the best light?”\r\n\r\nThis sudden alteration took me still more by surprise, and gave me almost\r\nan additional shock; but it was evident that I must follow the changes of\r\nhis mood, or at least the sudden repression of sentiment which he\r\noriginated. We went into that simpler question with great seriousness,\r\nconsulting which would be the best light. “You know I can scarcely\r\nadvise,” I said; “I have never been familiar with this room. I should\r\nlike to put off, if you don’t mind, till daylight.”\r\n\r\n“I think,” he said, “that this would be the best place.” It was on the\r\nother side of the fireplace, on the wall which faced the windows,--not\r\nthe best light, I knew enough to be aware, for an oil-painting. When I\r\nsaid so, however, he answered me with a little impatience, “It does not\r\nmatter very much about the best light; there will be nobody to see it but\r\nyou and me. I have my reasons--” There was a small table standing against\r\nthe wall at this spot, on which he had his hand as he spoke. Upon it\r\nstood a little basket in very fine lace-like wicker-work. His hand must\r\nhave trembled, for the table shook, and the basket fell, its contents\r\nturning out upon the carpet,--little bits of needlework, colored silks, a\r\nsmall piece of knitting half done. He laughed as they rolled out at his\r\nfeet, and tried to stoop to collect them, then tottered to a chair, and\r\ncovered for a moment his face with his hands.\r\n\r\nNo need to ask what they were. No woman’s work had been seen in the house\r\nsince I could recollect it. I gathered them up reverently and put them\r\nback. I could see, ignorant as I was, that the bit of knitting was\r\nsomething for an infant. What could I do less than put it to my lips? It\r\nhad been left in the doing--for me.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I think this is the best place,” my father said a minute after, in\r\nhis usual tone.\r\n\r\nWe placed it there that evening with our own hands. The picture was\r\nlarge, and in a heavy frame, but my father would let no one help me but\r\nhimself. And then, with a superstition for which I never could give any\r\nreason even to myself, having removed the packings, we closed and locked\r\nthe door, leaving the candles about the room, in their soft, strange\r\nillumination, lighting the first night of her return to her old place.\r\n\r\nThat night no more was said. My father went to his room early, which was\r\nnot his habit. He had never, however, accustomed me to sit late with him\r\nin the library. I had a little study or smoking-room of my own, in which\r\nall my special treasures were, the collections of my travels and my\r\nfavorite books,--and where I always sat after prayers, a ceremonial which\r\nwas regularly kept up in the house. I retired as usual this night to my\r\nroom, and, as usual, read,--but to-night somewhat vaguely, often pausing\r\nto think. When it was quite late, I went out by the glass door to the\r\nlawn, and walked round the house, with the intention of looking in at the\r\ndrawing-room windows, as I had done when a child. But I had forgotten\r\nthat these windows were all shuttered at night; and nothing but a faint\r\npenetration of the light within through the crevices bore witness to the\r\ninstallment of the new dweller there.\r\n\r\nIn the morning my father was entirely himself again. He told me without\r\nemotion of the manner in which he had obtained the picture. It had\r\nbelonged to my mother’s family, and had fallen eventually into the hands\r\nof a cousin of hers, resident abroad,--“A man whom I did not like, and\r\nwho did not like me,” my father said; “there was, or had been, some\r\nrivalry, he thought: a mistake, but he was never aware of that. He\r\nrefused all my requests to have a copy made. You may suppose, Phil, that\r\nI wished this very much. Had I succeeded, you would have been acquainted,\r\nat least, with your mother’s appearance, and need not have sustained this\r\nshock. But he would not consent. It gave him, I think, a certain pleasure\r\nto think that he had the only picture. But now he is dead, and out of\r\nremorse, or with some other intention, has left it to me.”\r\n\r\n“That looks like kindness,” said I.\r\n\r\n“Yes; or something else. He might have thought that by so doing he was\r\nestablishing a claim upon me,” my father said; but he did not seem\r\ndisposed to add any more. On whose behalf he meant to establish a claim I\r\ndid not know, nor who the man was who had laid us under so great an\r\nobligation on his death-bed. He _had_ established a claim on me at least;\r\nthough, as he was dead, I could not see on whose behalf it was. And my\r\nfather said nothing more; he seemed to dislike the subject. When I\r\nattempted to return to it, he had recourse to his letters or his\r\nnewspapers. Evidently he had made up his mind to say no more.\r\n\r\nAfterwards I went into the drawing-room, to look at the picture once\r\nmore. It seemed to me that the anxiety in her eyes was not so evident as\r\nI had thought it last night. The light possibly was more favorable. She\r\nstood just above the place where, I make no doubt, she had sat in life,\r\nwhere her little work-basket was,--not very much above it. The picture\r\nwas full-length, and we had hung it low, so that she might have been\r\nstepping into the room, and was little above my own level as I stood and\r\nlooked at her again. Once more I smiled at the strange thought that this\r\nyoung creature--so young, almost childish--could be my mother; and once\r\nmore my eyes grew wet looking at her. He was a benefactor, indeed, who\r\nhad given her back to us. I said to myself, that if I could ever do\r\nanything for him or his, I would certainly do it, for my--for this lovely\r\nyoung creature’s sake. And with this in my mind, and all the thoughts\r\nthat came with it, I am obliged to confess that the other matter, which I\r\nhad been so full of on the previous night, went entirely out of my head.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is rarely, however, that such matters are allowed to slip out of one’s\r\nmind. When I went out in the afternoon for my usual stroll,--or rather\r\nwhen I returned from that stroll,--I saw once more before me the woman\r\nwith her baby, whose story had filled me with dismay on the previous\r\nevening. She was waiting at the gate as before, and, “Oh, gentleman, but\r\nhaven’t you got some news to give me?” she said.\r\n\r\n“My good woman,--I--have been greatly occupied. I have had--no time to do\r\nanything.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” she said, with a little cry of disappointment, “my man said not to\r\nmake too sure, and that the ways of the gentlefolks is hard to know.”\r\n\r\n“I cannot explain to you,” I said, as gently as I could, “what it is that\r\nhas made me forget you. It was an event that can only do you good in the\r\nend. Go home now, and see the man that took your things from you, and\r\ntell him to come to me. I promise you it shall all be put right.”\r\n\r\nThe woman looked at me in astonishment, then burst forth, as it seemed,\r\ninvoluntarily, “What! without asking no questions?” After this there came\r\na storm of tears and blessings, from which I made haste to escape, but\r\nnot without carrying that curious commentary on my rashness away with\r\nme,--“Without asking no questions?” It might be foolish, perhaps; but\r\nafter all, how slight a matter. To make the poor creature comfortable at\r\nthe cost of what,--a box or two of cigars, perhaps, or some other trifle.\r\nAnd if it should be her own fault, or her husband’s--what then? Had I\r\nbeen punished for all my faults, where should I have been now? And if the\r\nadvantage should be only temporary, what then? To be relieved and\r\ncomforted even for a day or two, was not that something to count in life?\r\nThus I quenched the fiery dart of criticism which my _protégée_ herself\r\nhad thrown into the transaction, not without a certain sense of the humor\r\nof it. Its effect, however, was to make me less anxious to see my father,\r\nto repeat my proposal to him, and to call his attention to the cruelty\r\nperformed in his name. This one case I had taken out of the category of\r\nwrongs to be righted, by assuming arbitrarily the position of Providence\r\nin my own person,--for, of course, I had bound myself to pay the poor\r\ncreature’s rent as well as redeem her goods,--and, whatever might happen\r\nto her in the future, had taken the past into my own hands. The man came\r\npresently to see me, who, it seems, had acted as my father’s agent in the\r\nmatter. “I don’t know, sir, how Mr. Canning will take it,” he said. “He\r\ndon’t want none of those irregular, bad-paying ones in his property. He\r\nalways says as to look over it and let the rent run on is making things\r\nworse in the end. His rule is, ‘Never more than a month, Stevens;’ that’s\r\nwhat Mr. Canning says to me, sir. He says, ‘More than that they can’t\r\npay. It’s no use trying.’ And it’s a good rule; it’s a very good rule. He\r\nwon’t hear none of their stories, sir. Bless you, you’d never get a penny\r\nof rent from them small houses if you listened to their tales. But if so\r\nbe as you’ll pay Mrs. Jordan’s rent, it’s none of my business how it’s\r\npaid, so long as it’s paid, and I’ll send her back her things. But\r\nthey’ll just have to be took next time,” he added composedly. “Over and\r\nover; it’s always the same story with them sort of poor folks,--they’re\r\ntoo poor for anything, that’s the truth,” the man said.\r\n\r\nMorphew came back to my room after my visitor was gone. “Mr. Philip,” he\r\nsaid, “you’ll excuse me, sir, but if you’re going to pay all the poor\r\nfolks’ rent as have distresses put in, you may just go into the court at\r\nonce, for it’s without end--”\r\n\r\n“I am going to be the agent myself, Morphew, and manage for my father;\r\nand we’ll soon put a stop to that,” I said, more cheerfully than I felt.\r\n\r\n“Manage for--master,” he said, with a face of consternation. “You,\r\nMr. Philip!”\r\n\r\n“You seem to have a great contempt for me, Morphew.”\r\n\r\nHe did not deny the fact. He said with excitement, “Master, sir,--master\r\ndon’t let himself be put a stop to by any man. Master’s--not one to be\r\nmanaged. Don’t you quarrel with master, Mr. Philip, for the love of God.”\r\nThe old man was quite pale.\r\n\r\n“Quarrel!” I said. “I have never quarrelled with my father, and I don’t\r\nmean to begin now.”\r\n\r\nMorphew dispelled his own excitement by making up the fire, which was\r\ndying in the grate. It was a very mild spring evening, and he made up a\r\ngreat blaze which would have suited December. This is one of many ways in\r\nwhich an old servant will relieve his mind. He muttered all the time as\r\nhe threw on the coals and wood. “He’ll not like it,--we all know as he’ll\r\nnot like it. Master won’t stand no meddling, Mr. Philip,”--this last he\r\ndischarged at me like a flying arrow as he closed the door.\r\n\r\nI soon found there was truth in what he said. My father was not angry, he\r\nwas even half amused. “I don’t think that plan of yours will hold water,\r\nPhil. I hear you have been paying rents and redeeming furniture,--that’s\r\nan expensive game, and a very profitless one. Of course, so long as you\r\nare a benevolent gentleman acting for your own pleasure, it makes no\r\ndifference to me. I am quite content if I get my money, even out of your\r\npockets,--so long as it amuses you. But as my collector, you know, which\r\nyou are good enough to propose to be--”\r\n\r\n“Of course I should act under your orders,” I said; “but at least you\r\nmight be sure that I would not commit you to any--to any--” I paused\r\nfor a word.\r\n\r\n“Act of oppression,” he said, with a smile--“piece of cruelty,\r\nexaction--there are half-a-dozen words--”\r\n\r\n“Sir--” I cried.\r\n\r\n“Stop, Phil, and let us understand each other. I hope I have always been\r\na just man. I do my duty on my side, and I expect it from others. It is\r\nyour benevolence that is cruel. I have calculated anxiously how much\r\ncredit it is safe to allow; but I will allow no man, or woman either, to\r\ngo beyond what he or she can make up. My law is fixed. Now you\r\nunderstand. My agents, as you call them, originate nothing; they execute\r\nonly what I decide--”\r\n\r\n“But then no circumstances are taken into account,--no bad luck, no evil\r\nchances, no loss unexpected.”\r\n\r\n“There are no evil chances,” he said; “there is no bad luck; they reap as\r\nthey sow. No, I don’t go among them to be cheated by their stories, and\r\nspend quite unnecessary emotion in sympathizing with them. You will find\r\nit much better for you that I don’t. I deal with them on a general rule,\r\nmade, I assure you, not without a great deal of thought.”\r\n\r\n“And must it always be so?” I said. “Is there no way of ameliorating or\r\nbringing in a better state of things?”\r\n\r\n“It seems not,” he said; “we don’t get ‘no forrarder’ in that\r\ndirection so far as I can see.” And then he turned the conversation to\r\ngeneral matters.\r\n\r\nI retired to my room greatly discouraged that night. In former ages--or\r\nso one is led to suppose--and in the lower primitive classes who still\r\nlinger near the primeval type, action of any kind was, and is, easier\r\nthan amid the complication of our higher civilization. A bad man is a\r\ndistinct entity, against whom you know more or less what steps to take. A\r\ntyrant, an oppressor, a bad landlord, a man who lets miserable tenements\r\nat a rack-rent (to come down to particulars), and exposes his wretched\r\ntenants to all those abominations of which we have heard so much--well!\r\nhe is more or less a satisfactory opponent. There he is, and there is\r\nnothing to be said for him--down with him! and let there be an end of his\r\nwickedness. But when, on the contrary, you have before you a good man, a\r\njust man, who has considered deeply a question which you allow to be full\r\nof difficulty; who regrets, but cannot, being human, avert the miseries\r\nwhich to some unhappy individuals follow from the very wisdom of his\r\nrule,--what can you do? What is to be done? Individual benevolence at\r\nhaphazard may balk him here and there, but what have you to put in the\r\nplace of his well-considered scheme? Charity which makes paupers? or what\r\nelse? I had not considered the question deeply, but it seemed to me that\r\nI now came to a blank wall, which my vague human sentiment of pity and\r\nscorn could find no way to breach. There must be wrong somewhere, but\r\nwhere? There must be some change for the better to be made, but how?\r\n\r\nI was seated with a book before me on the table, with my head supported\r\non my hands. My eyes were on the printed page, but I was not reading; my\r\nmind was full of these thoughts, my heart of great discouragement and\r\ndespondency,--a sense that I could do nothing, yet that there surely must\r\nand ought, if I but knew it, be something to do. The fire which Morphew\r\nhad built up before dinner was dying out, the shaded lamp on my table\r\nleft all the corners in a mysterious twilight. The house was perfectly\r\nstill, no one moving: my father in the library, where, after the habit of\r\nmany solitary years, he liked to be left alone, and I here in my retreat,\r\npreparing for the formation of similar habits. I thought all at once of\r\nthe third member of the party, the new-comer, alone too in the room that\r\nhad been hers; and there suddenly occurred to me a strong desire to take\r\nup my lamp and go to the drawing-room and visit her, to see whether her\r\nsoft, angelic face would give any inspiration. I restrained, however,\r\nthis futile impulse,--for what could the picture say?--and instead\r\nwondered what might have been had she lived, had she been there, warmly\r\nenthroned beside the warm domestic centre, the hearth which would have\r\nbeen a common sanctuary, the true home. In that case what might have\r\nbeen? Alas! the question was no more simple to answer than the other: she\r\nmight have been there alone too, her husband’s business, her son’s\r\nthoughts, as far from her as now, when her silent representative held her\r\nold place in the silence and darkness. I had known it so, often enough.\r\nLove itself does not always give comprehension and sympathy. It might be\r\nthat she was more to us there, in the sweet image of her undeveloped\r\nbeauty, than she might have been had she lived and grown to maturity and\r\nfading, like the rest.\r\n\r\nI cannot be certain whether my mind was still lingering on this not very\r\ncheerful reflection, or if it had been left behind, when the strange\r\noccurrence came of which I have now to tell. Can I call it an occurrence?\r\nMy eyes were on my book, when I thought I heard the sound of a door\r\nopening and shutting, but so far away and faint that if real at all it\r\nmust have been in a far corner of the house. I did not move except to\r\nlift my eyes from the book as one does instinctively the better to\r\nlisten; when--But I cannot tell, nor have I ever been able to describe\r\nexactly what it was. My heart made all at once a sudden leap in my\r\nbreast. I am aware that this language is figurative, and that the heart\r\ncannot leap; but it is a figure so entirely justified by sensation, that\r\nno one will have any difficulty in understanding what I mean. My heart\r\nleaped up and began beating wildly in my throat, in my ears, as if my\r\nwhole being had received a sudden and intolerable shock. The sound went\r\nthrough my head like the dizzy sound of some strange mechanism, a\r\nthousand wheels and springs circling, echoing, working in my brain. I\r\nfelt the blood bound in my veins, my mouth became dry, my eyes hot; a\r\nsense of something insupportable took possession of me. I sprang to my\r\nfeet, and then I sat down again. I cast a quick glance round me beyond\r\nthe brief circle of the lamplight, but there was nothing there to\r\naccount in any way for this sudden extraordinary rush of sensation, nor\r\ncould I feel any meaning in it, any suggestion, any moral impression. I\r\nthought I must be going to be ill, and got out my watch and felt my\r\npulse: it was beating furiously, about one hundred and twenty-five throbs\r\nin a minute. I knew of no illness that could come on like this without\r\nwarning, in a moment, and I tried to subdue myself, to say to myself that\r\nit was nothing, some flutter of the nerves, some physical disturbance. I\r\nlaid myself down upon my sofa to try if rest would help me, and kept\r\nstill, as long as the thumping and throbbing of this wild, excited\r\nmechanism within, like a wild beast plunging and struggling, would let\r\nme. I am quite aware of the confusion of the metaphor; the reality was\r\njust so. It was like a mechanism deranged, going wildly with\r\never-increasing precipitation, like those horrible wheels that from time\r\nto time catch a helpless human being in them and tear him to pieces; but\r\nat the same time it was like a maddened living creature making the\r\nwildest efforts to get free.\r\n\r\nWhen I could bear this no longer I got up and walked about my room; then\r\nhaving still a certain command of myself, though I could not master the\r\ncommotion within me, I deliberately took down an exciting book from the\r\nshelf, a book of breathless adventure which had always interested me, and\r\ntried with that to break the spell. After a few minutes, however, I flung\r\nthe book aside; I was gradually losing all power over myself. What I\r\nshould be moved to do,--to shout aloud, to struggle with I know not what;\r\nor if I was going mad altogether, and next moment must be a raving\r\nlunatic,--I could not tell. I kept looking round, expecting I don’t know\r\nwhat; several times with the corner of my eye I seemed to see a movement,\r\nas if some one was stealing out of sight; but when I looked straight,\r\nthere was never anything but the plain outlines of the wall and carpet,\r\nthe chairs standing in good order. At last I snatched up the lamp in my\r\nhand, and went out of the room. To look at the picture, which had been\r\nfaintly showing in my imagination from time to time, the eyes, more\r\nanxious than ever, looking at me from out the silent air? But no; I\r\npassed the door of that room swiftly, moving, it seemed, without any\r\nvolition of my own, and before I knew where I was going, went into my\r\nfather’s library with my lamp in my hand.\r\n\r\nHe was still sitting there at his writing-table; he looked up astonished\r\nto see me hurrying in with my light. “Phil!” he said, surprised. I\r\nremember that I shut the door behind me, and came up to him, and set down\r\nthe lamp on his table. My sudden appearance alarmed him. “What is the\r\nmatter?” he cried. “Philip, what have you been doing with yourself?”\r\n\r\nI sat down on the nearest chair and gasped, gazing at him. The wild\r\ncommotion ceased; the blood subsided into its natural channels; my\r\nheart resumed its place. I use such words as mortal weakness can to\r\nexpress the sensations I felt. I came to myself thus, gazing at him,\r\nconfounded, at once by the extraordinary passion which I had gone\r\nthrough, and its sudden cessation. “The matter?” I cried; “I don’t\r\nknow what is the matter.”\r\n\r\nMy father had pushed his spectacles up from his eyes. He appeared to me\r\nas faces appear in a fever, all glorified with light which is not in\r\nthem,--his eyes glowing, his white hair shining like silver; but his\r\nlooks were severe. “You are not a boy, that I should reprove you; but you\r\nought to know better,” he said.\r\n\r\nThen I explained to him, so far as I was able, what had happened. Had\r\nhappened? Nothing had happened. He did not understand me; nor did I, now\r\nthat it was over, understand myself; but he saw enough to make him aware\r\nthat the disturbance in me was serious, and not caused by any folly of my\r\nown. He was very kind as soon as he had assured himself of this, and\r\ntalked, taking pains to bring me back to unexciting subjects. He had a\r\nletter in his hand with a very deep border of black when I came in. I\r\nobserved it, without taking any notice or associating it with anything I\r\nknew. He had many correspondents; and although we were excellent friends,\r\nwe had never been on those confidential terms which warrant one man in\r\nasking another from whom a special letter has come. We were not so near\r\nto each other as this, though we were father and son. After a while I\r\nwent back to my own room, and finished the evening in my usual way,\r\nwithout any return of the excitement which, now that it was over, looked\r\nto me like some extraordinary dream. What had it meant? Had it meant\r\nanything? I said to myself that it must be purely physical, something\r\ngone temporarily amiss, which had righted itself. It was physical; the\r\nexcitement did not affect my mind. I was independent of it all the time,\r\na spectator of my own agitation, a clear proof that, whatever it was, it\r\nhad affected my bodily organization alone.\r\n\r\nNext day I returned to the problem which I had not been able to solve. I\r\nfound out my petitioner in the back street, and that she was happy in the\r\nrecovery of her possessions, which to my eyes indeed did not seem very\r\nworthy either of lamentation or delight. Nor was her house the tidy house\r\nwhich injured virtue should have when restored to its humble rights. She\r\nwas not injured virtue, it was clear. She made me a great many curtseys,\r\nand poured forth a number of blessings. Her “man” came in while I was\r\nthere, and hoped in a gruff voice that God would reward me, and that the\r\nold gentleman’d let ’em alone. I did not like the look of the man. It\r\nseemed to me that in the dark lane behind the house of a winter’s night\r\nhe would not be a pleasant person to find in one’s way. Nor was this all:\r\nwhen I went out into the little street which it appeared was all, or\r\nalmost all, my father’s property, a number of groups formed in my way,\r\nand at least half-a-dozen applicants sidled up. “I’ve more claims nor\r\nMary Jordan any day,” said one; “I’ve lived on Squire Canning’s property,\r\none place and another, this twenty year.” “And what do you say to me?”\r\nsaid another; “I’ve six children to her two, bless you, sir, and ne’er a\r\nfather to do for them.” I believed in my father’s rule before I got out\r\nof the street, and approved his wisdom in keeping himself free from\r\npersonal contact with his tenants. Yet when I looked back upon the\r\nswarming thoroughfare, the mean little houses, the women at their doors\r\nall so open-mouthed and eager to contend for my favor, my heart sank\r\nwithin me at the thought that out of their misery some portion of our\r\nwealth came, I don’t care how small a portion; that I, young and strong,\r\nshould be kept idle and in luxury, in some part through the money screwed\r\nout of their necessities, obtained sometimes by the sacrifice of\r\neverything they prized! Of course I know all the ordinary commonplaces of\r\nlife as well as any one,--that if you build a house with your hand or\r\nyour money, and let it, the rent of it is your just due; and must be\r\npaid. But yet--\r\n\r\n“Don’t you think, sir,” I said that evening at dinner, the subject being\r\nreintroduced by my father himself, “that we have some duty towards them\r\nwhen we draw so much from them?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” he said; “I take as much trouble about their drains as I do\r\nabout my own.”\r\n\r\n“That is always something, I suppose.”\r\n\r\n“Something! it is a great deal; it is more than they get anywhere else. I\r\nkeep them clean, as far as that’s possible. I give them at least the\r\nmeans of keeping clean, and thus check disease, and prolong life, which\r\nis more, I assure you, than they’ve any right to expect.”\r\n\r\nI was not prepared with arguments as I ought to have been. That is all in\r\nthe Gospel according to Adam Smith, which my father had been brought up\r\nin, but of which the tenets had begun to be less binding in my day. I\r\nwanted something more, or else something less; but my views were not so\r\nclear, nor my system so logical and well-built, as that upon which my\r\nfather rested his conscience, and drew his percentage with a light heart.\r\n\r\nYet I thought there were signs in him of some perturbation. I met him one\r\nmorning coming out of the room in which the portrait hung, as if he had\r\ngone to look at it stealthily. He was shaking his head, and saying “No,\r\nno,” to himself, not perceiving me, and I stepped aside when I saw him so\r\nabsorbed. For myself, I entered that room but little. I went outside, as\r\nI had so often done when I was a child, and looked through the windows\r\ninto the still and now sacred place, which had always impressed me with\r\na certain awe. Looked at so, the slight figure in its white dress seemed\r\nto be stepping down into the room from some slight visionary altitude,\r\nlooking with that which had seemed to me at first anxiety, which I\r\nsometimes represented to myself now as a wistful curiosity, as if she\r\nwere looking for the life which might have been hers. Where was the\r\nexistence that had belonged to her, the sweet household place, the infant\r\nshe had left? She would no more recognize the man who thus came to look\r\nat her as through a veil, with a mystic reverence, than I could recognize\r\nher. I could never be her child to her, any more than she could be a\r\nmother to me.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThus time passed on for several quiet days. There was nothing to make us\r\ngive any special heed to the passage of time, life being very uneventful\r\nand its habits unvaried. My mind was very much preoccupied by my father’s\r\ntenants. He had a great deal of property in the town which was so near\r\nus,--streets of small houses, the best-paying property (I was assured) of\r\nany. I was very anxious to come to some settled conclusion: on the one\r\nhand, not to let myself be carried away by sentiment; on the other, not\r\nto allow my strongly roused feelings to fall into the blank of routine,\r\nas his had done. I was seated one evening in my own sitting-room, busy\r\nwith this matter,--busy with calculations as to cost and profit, with an\r\nanxious desire to convince him, either that his profits were greater than\r\njustice allowed, or that they carried with them a more urgent duty than\r\nhe had conceived.\r\n\r\nIt was night, but not late, not more than ten o’clock, the household\r\nstill astir. Everything was quiet,--not the solemnity of midnight\r\nsilence, in which there is always something of mystery, but the\r\nsoft-breathing quiet of the evening, full of the faint habitual sounds of\r\na human dwelling, a consciousness of life about. And I was very busy with\r\nmy figures, interested, feeling no room in my mind for any other thought.\r\nThe singular experience which had startled me so much had passed over\r\nvery quickly, and there had been no return. I had ceased to think of it;\r\nindeed, I had never thought of it save for the moment, setting it down\r\nafter it was over to a physical cause without much difficulty. At this\r\ntime I was far too busy to have thoughts to spare for anything, or room\r\nfor imagination; and when suddenly in a moment, without any warning, the\r\nfirst symptom returned, I started with it into determined resistance,\r\nresolute not to be fooled by any mock influence which could resolve\r\nitself into the action of nerves or ganglions. The first symptom; as\r\nbefore, was that my heart sprang up with a bound, as if a cannon had been\r\nfired at my ear. My whole being responded with a start. The pen fell out\r\nof my fingers, the figures went out of my head as if all faculty had\r\ndeparted; and yet I was conscious for a time at least of keeping my\r\nself-control. I was like the rider of a frightened horse, rendered almost\r\nwild by something which in the mystery of its voiceless being it has\r\nseen, something on the road which it will not pass, but wildly plunging,\r\nresisting every persuasion, turns from, with ever-increasing passion. The\r\nrider himself after a time becomes infected with this inexplainable\r\ndesperation of terror, and I suppose I must have done so; but for a time\r\nI kept the upper hand. I would not allow myself to spring up as I wished,\r\nas my impulse was, but sat there doggedly, clinging to my books, to my\r\ntable, fixing myself on I did not mind what, to resist the flood of\r\nsensation, of emotion, which was sweeping through me, carrying me away. I\r\ntried to continue my calculations. I tried to stir myself up with\r\nrecollections of the miserable sights I had seen, the poverty, the\r\nhelplessness. I tried to work myself into indignation; but all through\r\nthese efforts I felt the contagion growing upon me, my mind falling into\r\nsympathy with all those straining faculties of the body, startled,\r\nexcited, driven wild by something, I knew not what. It was not fear. I\r\nwas like a ship at sea straining and plunging against wind and tide, but\r\nI was not afraid. I am obliged to use these metaphors, otherwise I could\r\ngive no explanation of my condition, seized upon against my will, and\r\ntorn from all those moorings of reason to which I clung with desperation,\r\nas long as I had the strength.\r\n\r\nWhen I got up from my chair at last, the battle was lost, so far as my\r\npowers of self-control were concerned. I got up, or rather was dragged\r\nup, from my seat, clutching at these material things round me as with a\r\nlast effort to hold my own. But that was no longer possible; I was\r\novercome. I stood for a moment looking round me feebly, feeling myself\r\nbegin to babble with stammering lips, which was the alternative of\r\nshrieking, and which I seemed to choose as a lesser evil. What I said\r\nwas, “What am I to do?” and after a while, “What do you want me to do?”\r\nalthough throughout I saw no one, heard no voice, and had in reality not\r\npower enough in my dizzy and confused brain to know what I myself meant.\r\nI stood thus for a moment, looking blankly round me for guidance,\r\nrepeating the question, which seemed after a time to become almost\r\nmechanical, “What do you want me to do?” though I neither knew to whom I\r\naddressed it nor why I said it. Presently--whether in answer, whether in\r\nmere yielding of nature, I cannot tell--I became aware of a difference:\r\nnot a lessening of the agitation, but a softening, as if my powers of\r\nresistance being exhausted, a gentler force, a more benignant influence,\r\nhad room. I felt myself consent to whatever it was. My heart melted in\r\nthe midst of the tumult; I seemed to give myself up, and move as if drawn\r\nby some one whose arm was in mine, as if softly swept along, not\r\nforcibly, but with an utter consent of all my faculties to do I knew not\r\nwhat, for love of I knew not whom. For love,--that was how it\r\nseemed,--not by force, as when I went before. But my steps took the same\r\ncourse: I went through the dim passages in an exaltation indescribable,\r\nand opened the door of my father’s room.\r\n\r\nHe was seated there at his table as usual, the light of the lamp falling\r\non his white hair; he looked up with some surprise at the sound of the\r\nopening door. “Phil,” he said, and with a look of wondering apprehension\r\non his face, watched my approach. I went straight up to him and put my\r\nhand on his shoulder. “Phil, what is the matter? What do you want with\r\nme? What is it?” he said.\r\n\r\n“Father, I can’t tell you. I come not of myself. There must be something\r\nin it, though I don’t know what it is. This is the second time I have\r\nbeen brought to you here.”\r\n\r\n“Are you going--?” He stopped himself. The exclamation had been begun\r\nwith an angry intention. He stopped, looking at me with a scared look, as\r\nif perhaps it might be true.\r\n\r\n“Do you mean mad? I don’t think so. I have no delusions that I know of.\r\nFather, think--do you know any reason why I am brought here? for some\r\ncause there must be.”\r\n\r\nI stood with my hand upon the back of his chair. His table was covered\r\nwith papers, among which were several letters with the broad black border\r\nwhich I had before observed. I noticed this now in my excitement without\r\nany distinct association of thoughts, for that I was not capable of; but\r\nthe black border caught my eye. And I was conscious that he too gave a\r\nhurried glance at them, and with one hand swept them away.\r\n\r\n“Philip,” he said, pushing back his chair, “you must be ill, my poor boy.\r\nEvidently we have not been treating you rightly; you have been more ill\r\nall through than I supposed. Let me persuade you to go to bed.”\r\n\r\n“I am perfectly well,” I said. “Father, don’t let us deceive one another.\r\nI am neither a man to go mad nor to see ghosts. What it is that has got\r\nthe command over me I can’t tell; but there is some cause for it. You are\r\ndoing something or planning something with which I have a right to\r\ninterfere.”\r\n\r\nHe turned round squarely in his chair, with a spark in his blue eyes.\r\nHe was not a man to be meddled with. “I have yet to learn what can\r\ngive my son a right to interfere. I am in possession of all my\r\nfaculties, I hope.”\r\n\r\n“Father,” I cried, “won’t you listen to me? No one can say I have been\r\nundutiful or disrespectful. I am a man, with a right to speak my mind,\r\nand I have done so; but this is different. I am not here by my own will.\r\nSomething that is stronger than I has brought me. There is something in\r\nyour mind which disturbs--others. I don’t know what I am saying. This is\r\nnot what I meant to say; but you know the meaning better than I. Some\r\none--who can speak to you only by me--speaks to you by me; and I know\r\nthat you understand.”\r\n\r\nHe gazed up at me, growing pale, and his underlip fell. I, for my part,\r\nfelt that my message was delivered. My heart sank into a stillness so\r\nsudden that it made me faint. The light swam in my eyes; everything went\r\nround with me. I kept upright only by my hold upon the chair; and in the\r\nsense of utter weakness that followed, I dropped on my knees I think\r\nfirst, then on the nearest seat that presented itself, and, covering my\r\nface with my hands, had hard ado not to sob, in the sudden removal of\r\nthat strange influence,--the relaxation of the strain.\r\n\r\nThere was silence between us for some time; then he said, but with a\r\nvoice slightly broken, “I don’t understand you, Phil. You must have\r\ntaken some fancy into your mind which my slower intelligence--Speak out\r\nwhat you want to say. What do you find fault with? Is it all--all that\r\nwoman Jordan?”\r\n\r\nHe gave a short, forced laugh as he broke off, and shook me\r\nalmost roughly by the shoulder, saying, “Speak out! what--what do\r\nyou want to say?”\r\n\r\n“It seems, sir, that I have said everything.” My voice trembled more than\r\nhis, but not in the same way. “I have told you that I did not come by my\r\nown will,--quite otherwise. I resisted as long as I could: now all is\r\nsaid. It is for you to judge whether it was worth the trouble or not.”\r\n\r\nHe got up from his seat in a hurried way. “You would have me as--mad as\r\nyourself,” he said, then sat down again as quickly. “Come, Phil: if it\r\nwill please you, not to make a breach,--the first breach between us,--you\r\nshall have your way. I consent to your looking into that matter about the\r\npoor tenants. Your mind shall not be upset about that, even though I\r\ndon’t enter into all your views.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” I said; “but, father, that is not what it is.”\r\n\r\n“Then it is a piece of folly,” he said angrily. “I suppose you mean--but\r\nthis is a matter in which I choose to judge for myself.”\r\n\r\n“You know what I mean,” I said, as quietly as I could, “though I don’t\r\nmyself know; that proves there is good reason for it. Will you do one\r\nthing for me before I leave you? Come with me into the drawing-room--”\r\n\r\n“What end,” he said, with again the tremble in his voice, “is to be\r\nserved by that?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t very well know; but to look at her, you and I together, will\r\nalways do something for us, sir. As for breach, there can be no breach\r\nwhen we stand there.”\r\n\r\nHe got up, trembling like an old man, which he was, but which he never\r\nlooked like save at moments of emotion like this, and told me to take the\r\nlight; then stopped when he had got half-way across the room. “This is a\r\npiece of theatrical sentimentality,” he said. “No, Phil, I will not go. I\r\nwill not bring her into any such--Put down the lamp, and, if you will\r\ntake my advice, go to bed.”\r\n\r\n“At least,” I said, “I will trouble you no more, father, to-night. So\r\nlong as you understand, there need be no more to say.”\r\n\r\nHe gave me a very curt “good-night,” and turned back to his papers,--the\r\nletters with the black edge, either by my imagination or in reality,\r\nalways keeping uppermost. I went to my own room for my lamp, and then\r\nalone proceeded to the silent shrine in which the portrait hung. I at\r\nleast would look at her to-night. I don’t know whether I asked myself,\r\nin so many words, if it were she who--or if it was any one--I knew\r\nnothing; but my heart was drawn with a softness--born, perhaps, of the\r\ngreat weakness in which I was left after that visitation--to her, to look\r\nat her, to see, perhaps, if there was any sympathy, any approval in her\r\nface. I set down my lamp on the table where her little work-basket still\r\nwas; the light threw a gleam upward upon her,--she seemed more than ever\r\nto be stepping into the room, coming down towards me, coming back to her\r\nlife. Ah, no! her life was lost and vanished: all mine stood between her\r\nand the days she knew. She looked at me with eyes that did not change.\r\nThe anxiety I had seen at first seemed now a wistful, subdued question;\r\nbut that difference was not in her look but in mine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI need not linger on the intervening time. The doctor who attended us\r\nusually, came in next day “by accident,” and we had a long conversation.\r\nOn the following day a very impressive yet genial gentleman from town\r\nlunched with us,--a friend of my father’s, Dr. Something; but the\r\nintroduction was hurried, and I did not catch his name. He, too, had a\r\nlong talk with me afterwards, my father being called away to speak to\r\nsome one on business. Dr.---- drew me out on the subject of the dwellings\r\nof the poor. He said he heard I took great interest in this question,\r\nwhich had come so much to the front at the present moment. He was\r\ninterested in it too, and wanted to know the view I took. I explained at\r\nconsiderable length that my view did not concern the general subject, on\r\nwhich I had scarcely thought, so much as the individual mode of\r\nmanagement of my father’s estate. He was a most patient and intelligent\r\nlistener, agreeing with me on some points, differing in others; and his\r\nvisit was very pleasant. I had no idea until after of its special object;\r\nthough a certain puzzled look and slight shake of the head when my father\r\nreturned, might have thrown some light upon it. The report of the medical\r\nexperts in my case must, however, have been quite satisfactory, for I\r\nheard nothing more of them. It was, I think, a fortnight later when the\r\nnext and last of these strange experiences came.\r\n\r\nThis time it was morning, about noon,--a wet and rather dismal spring\r\nday. The half-spread leaves seemed to tap at the window, with an appeal\r\nto be taken in; the primroses, that showed golden upon the grass at the\r\nroots of the trees, just beyond the smooth-shorn grass of the lawn, were\r\nall drooped and sodden among their sheltering leaves. The very growth\r\nseemed dreary--the sense of spring in the air making the feeling of\r\nwinter a grievance, instead of the natural effect which it had conveyed a\r\nfew months before. I had been writing letters, and was cheerful enough,\r\ngoing back among the associates of my old life, with, perhaps, a little\r\nlonging for its freedom and independence, but at the same time a not\r\nungrateful consciousness that for the moment my present tranquillity\r\nmight be best.\r\n\r\nThis was my condition--a not unpleasant one--when suddenly the now\r\nwell-known symptoms of the visitation to which I had become subject\r\nsuddenly seized upon me,--the leap of the heart; the sudden, causeless,\r\noverwhelming physical excitement, which I could neither ignore nor allay.\r\nI was terrified beyond description, beyond reason, when I became\r\nconscious that this was about to begin over again: what purpose did it\r\nanswer; what good was in it? My father indeed understood the meaning of\r\nit though I did not understand; but it was little agreeable to be thus\r\nmade a helpless instrument, without any will of mine, in an operation of\r\nwhich I knew nothing; and to enact the part of the oracle unwillingly,\r\nwith suffering and such a strain as it took me days to get over. I\r\nresisted, not as before, but yet desperately, trying with better\r\nknowledge to keep down the growing passion. I hurried to my room and\r\nswallowed a dose of a sedative which had been given me to procure sleep\r\non my first return from India. I saw Morphew in the hall, and called him\r\nto talk to him, and cheat myself, if possible, by that means. Morphew\r\nlingered, however, and, before he came, I was beyond conversation. I\r\nheard him speak, his voice coming vaguely through the turmoil which was\r\nalready in my ears, but what he said I have never known. I stood staring,\r\ntrying to recover my power of attention, with an aspect which ended by\r\ncompletely frightening the man. He cried out at last that he was sure I\r\nwas ill, that he must bring me something; which words penetrated more or\r\nless into my maddened brain. It became impressed upon me that he was\r\ngoing to get some one--one of my father’s doctors, perhaps--to prevent\r\nme from acting, to stop my interference, and that if I waited a moment\r\nlonger I might be too late. A vague idea seized me at the same time, of\r\ntaking refuge with the portrait,--going to its feet, throwing myself\r\nthere, perhaps, till the paroxysm should be over. But it was not there\r\nthat my footsteps were directed. I can remember making an effort to open\r\nthe door of the drawing-room, and feeling myself swept past it, as if by\r\na gale of wind. It was not there that I had to go. I knew very well where\r\nI had to go,--once more on my confused and voiceless mission to my\r\nfather, who understood, although I could not understand.\r\n\r\nYet as it was daylight, and all was clear, I could not help noting one or\r\ntwo circumstances on my way. I saw some one sitting in the hall as if\r\nwaiting,--a woman, a girl, a black-shrouded figure, with a thick veil\r\nover her face; and asked myself who she was, and what she wanted there.\r\nThis question, which had nothing to do with my present condition, somehow\r\ngot into my mind, and was tossed up and down upon the tumultuous tide\r\nlike a stray log on the breast of a fiercely rolling stream, now\r\nsubmerged, now coming uppermost, at the mercy of the waters. It did not\r\nstop me for a moment, as I hurried towards my father’s room, but it got\r\nupon the current of my mind. I flung open my father’s door, and closed it\r\nagain after me, without seeing who was there or how he was engaged. The\r\nfull clearness of the daylight did not identify him as the lamp did at\r\nnight. He looked up at the sound of the door, with a glance of\r\napprehension; and rising suddenly, interrupting some one who was standing\r\nspeaking to him with much earnestness and even vehemence, came forward to\r\nmeet me. “I cannot be disturbed at present,” he said quickly; “I am\r\nbusy.” Then seeing the look in my face, which by this time he knew, he\r\ntoo changed color. “Phil,” he said, in a low, imperative voice, “wretched\r\nboy, go away--go away; don’t let a stranger see you--”\r\n\r\n“I can’t go away,” I said. “It is impossible. You know why I have come. I\r\ncannot, if I would. It is more powerful than I--”\r\n\r\n“Go, sir,” he said; “go at once; no more of this folly. I will not have\r\nyou in this room: Go-go!”\r\n\r\nI made no answer. I don’t know that I could have done so. There had\r\nnever been any struggle between us before; but I had no power to do\r\none thing or another. The tumult within me was in full career. I heard\r\nindeed what he said, and was able to reply; but his words, too, were\r\nlike straws tossed upon the tremendous stream. I saw now with my\r\nfeverish eyes who the other person present was. It was a woman, dressed\r\nalso in mourning similar to the one in the hall; but this a middle-aged\r\nwoman, like a respectable servant. She had been crying, and in the\r\npause caused by this encounter between my father and myself, dried her\r\neyes with a handkerchief, which she rolled like a ball in her hand,\r\nevidently in strong emotion. She turned and looked at me as my father\r\nspoke to me, for a moment with a gleam of hope, then falling back into\r\nher former attitude.\r\n\r\nMy father returned to his seat. He was much agitated too, though doing\r\nall that was possible to conceal it. My inopportune arrival was evidently\r\na great and unlooked-for vexation to him. He gave me the only look of\r\npassionate displeasure I have ever had from him, as he sat down again;\r\nbut he said nothing more.\r\n\r\n“You must understand,” he said, addressing the woman, “that I have said\r\nmy last words on this subject. I don’t choose to enter into it again in\r\nthe presence of my son, who is not well enough to be made a party to any\r\ndiscussion. I am sorry that you should have had so much trouble in vain,\r\nbut you were warned beforehand, and you have only yourself to blame. I\r\nacknowledge no claim, and nothing you can say will change my resolution.\r\nI must beg you to go away. All this is very painful and quite useless. I\r\nacknowledge no claim.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, sir,” she cried, her eyes beginning once more to flow, her speech\r\ninterrupted by little sobs. “Maybe I did wrong to speak of a claim. I’m\r\nnot educated to argue with a gentleman. Maybe we have no claim. But if\r\nit’s not by right, oh, Mr. Canning, won’t you let your heart be touched\r\nby pity? She don’t know what I’m saying, poor dear. She’s not one to beg\r\nand pray for herself, as I’m doing for her. Oh, sir, she’s so young!\r\nShe’s so lone in this world,--not a friend to stand by her, nor a house\r\nto take her in! You are the nearest to her of any one that’s left in this\r\nworld. She hasn’t a relation,--not one so near as you,--oh!” she cried,\r\nwith a sudden thought, turning quickly round upon me, “this gentleman’s\r\nyour son! Now I think of it, it’s not your relation she is, but his,\r\nthrough his mother! That’s nearer, nearer! Oh, sir! you’re young; your\r\nheart should be more tender. Here is my young lady that has no one in the\r\nworld to look to her. Your own flesh and blood; your mother’s\r\ncousin,--your mother’s--”\r\n\r\nMy father called to her to stop, with a voice of thunder. “Philip, leave\r\nus at once. It is not a matter to be discussed with you.”\r\n\r\nAnd then in a moment it became clear to me what it was. It had been with\r\ndifficulty that I had kept myself still. My breast was laboring with the\r\nfever of an impulse poured into me, more than I could contain. And now\r\nfor the first time I knew why. I hurried towards him, and took his hand,\r\nthough he resisted, into mine. Mine were burning, but his like ice: their\r\ntouch burnt me with its chill, like fire. “This is what it is?” I cried.\r\n“I had no knowledge before. I don’t know now what is being asked of you.\r\nBut, father, understand! You know, and I know now, that some one sends\r\nme,--some one--who has a right to interfere.”\r\n\r\nHe pushed me away with all his might. “You are mad,” he cried. “What\r\nright have you to think--? Oh, you are mad--mad! I have seen it\r\ncoming on--”\r\n\r\nThe woman, the petitioner, had grown silent, watching this brief conflict\r\nwith the terror and interest with which women watch a struggle between\r\nmen. She started and fell back when she heard what he said, but did not\r\ntake her eyes off me, following every movement I made. When I turned to\r\ngo away, a cry of indescribable disappointment and remonstrance burst\r\nfrom her, and even my father raised himself up and stared at my\r\nwithdrawal, astonished to find that he had overcome me so soon and\r\neasily. I paused for a moment, and looked back on them, seeing them large\r\nand vague through the mist of fever. “I am not going away,” I said. “I am\r\ngoing for another messenger,--one you can’t gainsay.”\r\n\r\nMy father rose. He called out to me threateningly, “I will have nothing\r\ntouched that is hers. Nothing that is hers shall be profaned--”\r\n\r\nI waited to hear no more; I knew what I had to do. By what means it was\r\nconveyed to me I cannot tell; but the certainty of an influence which no\r\none thought of calmed me in the midst of my fever. I went out into the\r\nhall, where I had seen the young stranger waiting. I went up to her and\r\ntouched her on the shoulder. She rose at once, with a little movement of\r\nalarm, yet with docile and instant obedience, as if she had expected the\r\nsummons. I made her take off her veil and her bonnet, scarcely looking at\r\nher, scarcely seeing her, knowing how it was: I took her soft, small,\r\ncool, yet trembling hand into mine; it was so soft and cool,--not\r\ncold,--it refreshed me with its tremulous touch. All through I moved and\r\nspoke like a man in a dream; swiftly, noiselessly, all the complications\r\nof waking life removed; without embarrassment, without reflection,\r\nwithout the loss of a moment. My father was still standing up, leaning a\r\nlittle forward as he had done when I withdrew; threatening, yet\r\nterror-stricken, not knowing what I might be about to do, when I returned\r\nwith my companion. That was the one thing he had not thought of. He was\r\nentirely undecided, unprepared. He gave her one look, flung up his arms\r\nabove his head, and uttered a distracted cry, so wild that it seemed the\r\nlast outcry of nature,--“Agnes!” then fell back like a sudden ruin, upon\r\nhimself, into his chair.\r\n\r\nI had no leisure to think how he was, or whether he could hear what I\r\nsaid. I had my message to deliver. “Father,” I said, laboring with my\r\npanting breath, “it is for this that heaven has opened, and one whom I\r\nnever saw, one whom I know not, has taken possession of me. Had we been\r\nless earthly, we should have seen her--herself, and not merely her image.\r\nI have not even known what she meant. I have been as a fool without\r\nunderstanding. This is the third time I have come to you with her\r\nmessage, without knowing what to say. But now I have found it out. This\r\nis her message. I have found it out at last.” There was an awful\r\npause,--a pause in which no one moved or breathed. Then there came a\r\nbroken voice out of my father’s chair. He had not understood, though I\r\nthink he heard what I said. He put out two feeble hands. “Phil--I think I\r\nam dying--has she--has she come for me?” he said.\r\n\r\nWe had to carry him to his bed. What struggles he had gone through before\r\nI cannot tell. He had stood fast, and had refused to be moved, and now he\r\nfell,--like an old tower, like an old tree. The necessity there was for\r\nthinking of him saved me from the physical consequences which had\r\nprostrated me on a former occasion. I had no leisure now for any\r\nconsciousness of how matters went with myself.\r\n\r\nHis delusion was not wonderful, but most natural. She was clothed in\r\nblack from head to foot, instead of the white dress of the portrait. She\r\nhad no knowledge of the conflict, of nothing but that she was called for,\r\nthat her fate might depend on the next few minutes. In her eyes there was\r\na pathetic question, a line of anxiety in the lids, an innocent appeal in\r\nthe looks. And the face the same: the same lips, sensitive, ready to\r\nquiver; the same innocent, candid brow; the look of a common race, which\r\nis more subtle than mere resemblance. How I knew that it was so I cannot\r\ntell, nor any man. It was the other, the elder,--ah, no! not elder; the\r\never young, the Agnes to whom age can never come, she who they say was\r\nthe mother of a man who never saw her,--it was she who led her kinswoman,\r\nher representative, into our hearts.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy father recovered after a few days: he had taken cold, it was said, the\r\nday before; and naturally, at seventy, a small matter is enough to upset\r\nthe balance even of a strong man. He got quite well; but he was willing\r\nenough afterwards to leave the management of that ticklish kind of\r\nproperty which involves human well-being in my hands, who could move\r\nabout more freely, and see with my own eyes how things were going on. He\r\nliked home better, and had more pleasure in his personal existence in the\r\nend of his life. Agnes is now my wife, as he had, of course, foreseen. It\r\nwas not merely the disinclination to receive her father’s daughter, or to\r\ntake upon him a new responsibility, that had moved him, to do him\r\njustice; but both these motives had told strongly. I have never been\r\ntold, and now will never be told, what his griefs against my mother’s\r\nfamily, and specially against that cousin, had been; but that he had been\r\nvery determined, deeply prejudiced, there can be no doubt. It turned out\r\nafter, that the first occasion on which I had been mysteriously\r\ncommissioned to him with a message which I did not understand, and which\r\nfor that time he did not understand, was the evening of the day on which\r\nhe had received the dead man’s letter, appealing to him--to him, a man\r\nwhom he had wronged--on behalf of the child who was about to be left\r\nfriendless in the world. The second time, further letters--from the nurse\r\nwho was the only guardian of the orphan, and the chaplain of the place\r\nwhere her father had died, taking it for granted that my father’s house\r\nwas her natural refuge--had been received. The third I have already\r\ndescribed, and its results.\r\n\r\nFor a long time after, my mind was never without a lurking fear that the\r\ninfluence which had once taken possession of me might return again. Why\r\nshould I have feared to be influenced, to be the messenger of a blessed\r\ncreature, whose wishes could be nothing but heavenly? Who can say? Flesh\r\nand blood is not made for such encounters: they were more than I could\r\nbear. But nothing of the kind has ever occurred again.\r\n\r\nAgnes had her peaceful domestic throne established under the picture.\r\nMy father wished it to be so, and spent his evenings there in the\r\nwarmth and light, instead of in the old library,--in the narrow circle\r\ncleared by our lamp out of the darkness, as long as he lived. It is\r\nsupposed by strangers that the picture on the wall is that of my wife;\r\nand I have always been glad that it should be so supposed. She who was\r\nmy mother, who came back to me and became as my soul for three strange\r\nmoments and no more, but with whom I can feel no credible relationship\r\nas she stands there, has retired for me into the tender regions of the\r\nunseen. She has passed once more into the secret company of those\r\nshadows, who can only become real in an atmosphere fitted to modify and\r\nharmonize all differences, and make all wonders possible,--the light of\r\nthe perfect day.",
