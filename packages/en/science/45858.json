With Petronius he shared the\r\ndiscovery that there is material for literature in the debased and\r\nvarious life of every day--that to the seeing eye the individual is\r\nmore wonderful in colour and complexity than the severely simple\r\nabstraction of the poets. He replaced the tradition, respected of\r\nhis fathers, by an observation more vivid and less pedantic than\r\nthe note-book of the naturalist. He set the world in the dry light\r\nof truth, and since the vanity of mankind is a constant factor\r\nthroughout the ages, there is scarce a page of Lucian's writing that\r\nwears the faded air of antiquity. His personages are as familiar\r\nto-day as they were in the second century, because, with his pitiless\r\ndetermination to unravel the tangled skein of human folly, he never\r\nblinded his vision to their true qualities. And the multiplicity of\r\nhis interest is as fresh as his penetration. Nothing came amiss to\r\nhis eager curiosity. For the first time in the history of literature\r\n(with the doubtful exception of Cicero) we encounter a writer whose\r\nceaseless activity includes the world. While others had declared\r\nthemselves poets, historians, philosophers, Lucian comes forth as a\r\nman of letters. Had he lived to-day, he would have edited a newspaper,\r\nwritten leading articles, and kept his name ever before the public\r\nin the magazines. For he possessed the qualities, if he avoided the\r\ndefects, of the journalist. His phrase had not been worn by constant\r\nuse to imbecility; his sentences were not marred by the association\r\nof commonness; his style was still his own and fit for the expression\r\nof a personal view. But he noted such types and incidents as make an\r\nimmediate, if perennial, appeal, and to study him is to be convinced\r\nthat literature and journalism are not necessarily divorced.\r\n\r\nThe profession was new, and with the joy of the innovator Lucian was\r\nnever tired of inventing new genres. Romance, criticism, satire--he\r\nmastered them all. In _Toxaris_ and _The Ass_ he proves with what\r\ndelicacy and restraint he could handle the story. His ill-omened\r\napprenticeship to a sculptor gave him that taste and feeling for\r\nart which he turned to so admirable an account. He was, in fact,\r\nthe first of the art-critics, and he pursued the craft with an easy\r\nunconsciousness of the heritage he bequeathed to the world. True, he\r\nis silent concerning the technical practice of the Greeks; true, he\r\nleaves us in profound ignorance of the art of Zeuxis, whose secrets he\r\nmight have revealed, had he been less a man of letters. But he found\r\nin painting and sculpture an opportunity for elegance of phrase, and\r\nwe would forgive a thousand shortcomings for such inspirations of\r\nbeauty as the smile of Sosandra: to τὸ μειδίαμα σεμνὸν καὶ λεληθὸς. In\r\nliterary criticism he was on surer ground, and here also he leaves the\r\npast behind. His knowledge of Greek poetry was profound; Homer he had\r\nby heart; and on every page he proves his sympathies by covert allusion\r\nor precise quotation. His treatise concerning the Writing of History[1]\r\npreserves its force irresistible after seventeen centuries, nor has\r\nthe wisdom of the ages impeached or modified this lucid argument.\r\nWith a modest wit he compares himself to Diogenes, who, when he saw\r\nhis fellow-citizens busied with the preparations of war, gathered\r\nhis skirts about him and fell to rolling his tub up and down. So\r\nLucian, unambitious of writing history, sheltered himself from \"the\r\nwaves and the smoke,\" and was content to provide others with the best\r\nof good counsel. Yet such is the irony of accident that, as Lucian's\r\ncriticism has outlived the masterpieces of Zeuxis, so the historians\r\nhave snatched an immortality from his censure; and let it be remembered\r\nfor his glory that he used Thucydides as a scourge wherewith to beat\r\nimpostors. But matters of so high import did not always engross his\r\nhumour, and in _The Illiterate Book-buyer_[2] he satirizes a fashion of\r\nthe hour and of all time with a courage and brutality which tear the\r\nheart out of truth. How intimately does he realize his victim! And\r\nhow familiar is this same victim in his modern shape! You know the\r\nvery streets he haunts; you know the very shops wherein he is wont\r\nto acquire his foolish treasures; you recognize that not by a single\r\ntrait has Lucian dishonoured his model. In yet another strange instance\r\nLucian anticipated the journalist of to-day. Though his disciples\r\nknow it not, he invented the interview. In that famous visit to the\r\nElysian Fields, which is a purple patch upon his masterpiece, _The True\r\nHistory_, he \"went to talk with Homer the Poet, our leisure serving us\r\nboth well,\" and he put precisely those questions which the modern hack,\r\nnote-book in hand, would seek to resolve. First, remembering the seven\r\ncities, he would know of Homer what fatherland claimed him, and when\r\nthe poet \"said indeed he was a Babylonian, and among his own countrymen\r\nnot called Homer but Tigranes,\" Lucian straightly \"questioned him\r\nabout those verses in his books that are disallowed as not of his\r\nmaking;\" whereto Homer replied with a proper condemnation of Zenodotus\r\nand Aristarchus. And you wonder whether Lucian is chastising his\r\ncontemporaries or looking with the eye of a prophet into the future.\r\n\r\nBut even more remarkable than his many-coloured interest is Lucian's\r\nunderstanding. He was, so to say, a perfect Intelligence thrown by\r\naccident into an age of superstition and credulity. It is not only\r\nthat he knew all things: he saw all things in their right relation.\r\nIf the Pagan world had never before been conscious of itself, it had\r\nno excuse to harbour illusions after his coming. Mr. Pater speaks\r\nof the intellectual light he turned upon dim places, and truly no\r\ncorner of life escaped the gleam of his lantern. Gods, philosophers,\r\nnecromancers, yielded up their secrets to his enquiry. With pitiless\r\nlogic he criticized their extravagance and pretension; and actively\r\nanticipating the spirit of modern science, he accepted no fact,\r\nhe subscribed to no theory, which he had not examined with a cold\r\nimpartiality.\r\n\r\nIndeed, he was Scepticism in human shape, but as the weapon of his\r\ndestruction is always raillery, as he never takes either himself or his\r\nvictims with exaggerated seriousness, you may delight in his attack,\r\neven though you care not which side wins the battle. His wit was as\r\nmordant as Heine's own;--is it fantastical to suggest that Lucian too\r\ncarried Hebrew blood in his veins?--yet when the onslaught is most\r\nunsparing he is still joyous. For a gay contempt, not a bitter hatred,\r\nis the note of his satire. And for the very reason that his scepticism\r\nwas felt, that it sprang from a close intimacy with the follies of\r\nhis own time, so it is fresh and familiar to an age that knows not\r\nZeus. Not even the _Dialogues of the Gods_ are out of date, for if we\r\nno longer reverence Olympus, we still blink our eyes at the flash of\r\nridicule. And might not the _Philopseudes_, that masterly analysis of\r\nghostly terrors, might not _Alexander the False Prophet_, have been\r\nwritten yesterday?\r\n\r\nAnd thus we arrive at Lucian's weakness. In spite of its brilliance\r\nand flippancy, his scepticism is at times over-intelligent. His good\r\nsense baffles you by its infallibility; his sanity is so magnificently\r\nbeyond question, that you pray for an interlude of unreason. The\r\nsprightliness of his wit, the alertness of his fancy, mitigate the\r\nperpetual rightness of his judgment. But it must be confessed that for\r\nall his delicate sense of ridicule he cherished a misguided admiration\r\nof the truth. If only he had understood the joy of self-deception,\r\nif only he had realized more often (as he realized in _The Ass_) the\r\ndelight of throwing probability to the winds, we had regarded him with\r\na more constant affection. His capital defect sprang from a lack of the\r\nfull-blooded humour which should at times have led him into error. And\r\nyet by an irony it was this very love of truth which suggested _The\r\nTrue History_, that enduring masterpiece of phantasy. Setting out to\r\nprove his hatred of other men's lies, he shows himself on the road the\r\ngreatest liar of them all. \"The father and founder of all this foolery\r\nwas Homer's Ulysses\": thus he writes in his Preface, confessing that in\r\na spirit of emulation he \"turned his style to publish untruths,\" but\r\nwith an honester mind, \"for this one thing I confidently pronounce for\r\na truth, that I lie.\" Such is the spirit of the work, nor is there the\r\nsmallest doubt that Lucian, once embarked upon his voyage, slipped from\r\nhis ideal, to enjoy the lying for its own sake. If _The True History_\r\nfails as a parody, that is because we care not a jot for Ctesias,\r\nIambulus and the rest, at whom the satire is levelled. Its fascination,\r\nin fact, is due to those same qualities which, in others, its author\r\naffected to despise. The facile variety of its invention can scarce\r\nbe matched in literature, and the lies are told with so delightful\r\nan unconcern, that belief is never difficult. Nor does the narrative\r\never flag. It ends at the same high level of falsehood in which it\r\nhas its beginning. And the credibility is increased by the harmonious\r\nconsistency of each separate lie. At the outset the traveller discovers\r\na river of wine, and forthwith travels up stream to find the source,\r\nand \"when we were come to the head\" (to quote Hickes's translation),\r\n\"no spring at all appeared, but mighty vine trees of infinite number,\r\nwhich from their roots distilled pure wine, which made the river run\r\nso abundantly.\" So conclusive is the explanation, that you only would\r\nhave wondered had the stream been of water. And how admirable is the\r\nadded touch that he who ate fish from the river was made drunk! Then\r\nby a pleasant gradation you are carried on from the Hippogypians, or\r\nthe Riders of Vultures, every feather in whose wing is bigger and\r\nlonger than the mast of a tall ship, from the fleas as big as twelve\r\nelephants, to those spiders, of mighty bigness, every one of which\r\nexceeded in size an isle of the Cyclades. \"These were appointed to\r\nspin a web in the air between the Moon and the Morning Star, which was\r\ndone in an instant, and made a plain champaign, upon which the foot\r\nforces were planted.\" Truly a very Colossus of falsehood, but Lucian's\r\ningenuity is inexhausted and inexhaustible, and the mighty Whale is\r\nhis masterpiece of impudence. For he \"contained in greatness fifteen\r\nhundred furlongs\"; his teeth were taller than beech-trees, and when he\r\nswallowed the travellers, he showed himself so far superior to Jonah's\r\nfish, that ship and all sailed down his throat, and happily he caught\r\nnot the pigmy shallop between his chops. And the geographical divisions\r\nof the Whale's belly, and Lucian's adventures therein, are they not\r\nset down with circumstantial verity? Then there is the episode of the\r\nfrozen ship, and the sea of milk, with its well-pressed cheese for an\r\nisland, which reminds one of the Elizabethan madrigal: \"If there were\r\nO an Hellespont of Cream.\" Moreover, the verisimilitude is enhanced\r\nby a scrupulously simple style. No sooner is the preface concerning\r\nlying at an end than Lucian lapses into pure narrative. A wealth\r\nof minutely considered detail gives an air of reality to the most\r\nmonstrous impossibility; the smallest facts are explicitly divulged;\r\nthe remote accessories described with order and impressiveness; so that\r\nthe wildest invention appears plausible, even inevitable, and you know\r\nthat you are in company with the very genius of falsehood. Nor does\r\nthis wild diversity of invention suggest romance. It is still classic\r\nin style and shape; not a phrase nor a word is lost; and expression,\r\nas always in the classics, is reduced to its lowest terms. But when\r\nthe travellers reach the Islands of the Blessed, the style takes on a\r\ncolour and a beauty which it knew not before. A fragrant air breathed\r\nupon them, as of \"roses, daffodils, gillyflowers, lilies, violets,\r\nmyrtles, bays, and blossoms of vines.\" Happy also was the Isle to look\r\nupon: ἔνθα δὴ καὶ καθεωρῶμεν λιμένας τε πολλοὺς περὶ πᾶσαν ὰκλύστους\r\nκαὶ μεγάλους, ποταμούς τε διαυγεῖς ἐξίοντας ἠρέμα ἐς τὴν θάλατταν· ἔτὶ\r\nδὲ λειμῶνας καὶ ὕλας καὶ ὄρνεα μουσικὰ, τὰ μὲν πὶ τῶν ἠΐόνων ἄδοντα,\r\nπολλὰ δὲ καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν κλάδων ἀήρ τε κοῦφος καὶ εὔπνους περιεκέχυτο\r\nτὴν χώραν: \"a still and gentle air compassing the whole country.\"\r\nWhere will you find a more vivid impression of elegance and serenity?\r\nor where match \"the melody of the branches, like the sound of wind\r\ninstruments in a solitary place\" (ἀπὸ τῶν κλάδων κινουμένον τερπνὰ καὶ\r\nσυνεχῆ μέλη ἀπεσυρίξετο ἐοικότα τοῖς ἐπ' ἐρημίας αὐλήμασι τῶν πλαγίων\r\nαὐλῶν)? And when the splendour of the city breaks upon you, with its\r\nsmaragdus, its cinnamon-tree, its amethyst, ivory, and beryl, the rich\r\nbarbarity suggests Solomon's Temple, or the City of the Revelation.\r\nIts inhabitants are the occasion of infinite jesting, and again and\r\nagain does Lucian satirize the philosophers, his dearest foes. Socrates\r\nwas in danger of being thrust forth by Rhadamanthus, ἤν φλυαρῇ καὶ\r\nμὴ ἐθέλῃ ἀφεὶς τὴν εἰρωνείαν εὐωχεῖσθαι, while as for Diogenes the\r\nSinopean, so profoundly was he changed from his old estate, that he\r\nhad married Lais the Harlot. The journey to Hell is another excuse to\r\ngird at the historians. The severest torments were inflicted, says\r\nLucian, upon Ctesias the Cnidian, Herodotus and many others, which\r\nthe writer beholding \"was put in great hopes that I should never have\r\nanything to do there, for I do not know that ever I spake any untruth\r\nin my life.\" And yet with all his irony, all his scorn, Lucian has\r\never a side-glance at literature. The verse of Homer is constantly\r\nupon his lips, and it is from Homer that the Gods take their ditties\r\nin the Elysian fields. Again, when the traveller visits the city of\r\nNephelococcygia, it is but to think upon the poet Aristophanes, \"how\r\nwise a man he was, and how true a reporter, and how little cause there\r\nis to question his fidelity for what he hath written.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is the work which, itself a masterpiece, has been a pattern and\r\nan exemplar unto others. If Utopia and its unnumbered rivals derive\r\nfrom Plato, there is not a single Imaginary Traveller that is not\r\nmodelled upon Lucian. _The True History_ was, in effect, the beginning\r\nof a new literature. Not only was its framework borrowed, not only\r\nwas its habit of fantastic names piously imitated, but the disciples,\r\nlike the master, turned their voyages to the purpose of satire. It\r\nwas Rabelais who made the first adaptation, for, while Epistemon's\r\ndescent into Hell was certainly suggested by Lucian, Pantagruel's\r\nvoyage is an ample travesty of _The True History_, and Lanternland,\r\nthe home of the Lychnobii, is but Lychnopolis, Lucian's own City of\r\nLights. The seventeenth century discovered another imitator in Cyrano\r\nde Bergerac, whose tepid _Voyage dans la Lune_ is interesting merely\r\nbecause it is a link in the chain that unites Lucian with Swift.\r\nYet the book had an immense popularity, and Cyrano's biographer has\r\nnaught to say of the original traveller, save that he told his story\r\n\"avec beaucoup moins de vraisemblance et de gentilesse d'imagination\r\nque M. de Bergerac.\" An astounding judgment surely, which time has\r\nalready reversed. And then came _Gulliver's Travels_, incomparably the\r\ngreatest descendant of _The True History_. To what excellent purpose\r\nSwift followed his Lucian is proved alike by the amazing probability\r\nof his narrative, and the cruelty of his satire. Like Lucian, he\r\nprofessed an unveiled contempt for philosophers and mathematicians;\r\nunlike Lucian, he made his imaginary journey the occasion for a fierce\r\nsatire upon kings and politicians. But so masterly is the narrative,\r\nso convincing the reality of Lilliput and Brobdignag, that Gulliver\r\nretains its hold upon our imagination, though the meaning of its satire\r\nis long since blunted. Swift's work came to astonish the world in 1727,\r\nand some fourteen years later in the century Holberg astonished the\r\nwits of Denmark with a satire cast in Lucian's mould. _Nicolai Klimii\r\nIter Subterraneum_--thus ran the title, and from Latin the book was\r\ntranslated into every known tongue. The city of walking trees, the home\r\nof the Potuans, and many another invention, prove Holberg's debt to the\r\nauthor of _The True History_. And if the _genre_ is dead to-day, it is\r\ndead because the most intrepid humourist would hesitate to walk in the\r\nfootsteps of Lemuel Gulliver.\r\n\r\nFortunate in his imitators, Lucian has been not wholly unfortunate\r\nin his translators. Not even envy could pick a quarrel with Francis\r\nHickes, whose Englishing of _The True History_ is here reprinted. The\r\nbook appeared, under the auspices of Hickes's son, in 1634, four years\r\nafter the translator's death. Thus it is described on the title-page:\r\n\"Certaine Select Dialogues of Lucian together with his True Historie,\r\ntranslated from the Greeke into English by Mr. Francis Hickes.\r\nWhereunto is added the Life of Lucian gathered out of his own Writings,\r\nwith briefe Notes and Illustrations upon each Dialogue and Booke, by\r\nT. H. Master of Arts, of Christ Church in Oxford. Oxford, Printed by\r\nWilliam Turner. 1634.\" Composed with a certain dignity, it is dedicated\r\n\"to the Right Worshipfull Dr. Duppa, Deane of Christ-Church, and\r\nVice-Chancellor of the famous Universitie in Oxford.\" And the work\r\nreflects a wholesome glory upon the famous University. For it is the\r\nwork of a scholar, who knew both the languages. Though his diction\r\nlacked the spirit and colour which distinguished the splendid versions\r\nof North and Holland, he was far more keenly conscious of his original\r\nthan were those masters of prose. Not only did he, unlike North,\r\ntranslate directly from the Greek, but he followed his original with\r\nloyalty and patience. In brief, his Lucian is a miracle of suitability.\r\nThe close simplicity of Hickes fits the classical restraint of _The\r\nTrue History_ to admiration. As the Greek is a model of narrative,\r\nso you cannot read the English version without thinking of the\r\nincomparable Hakluyt. Thirty years after the first printing of the\r\ntranslation, Jasper Mayne published his \"Part of Lucian made English,\"\r\nwherein he added sundry versions of his own to the work already\r\naccomplished by Francis Hickes. And in his \"Epistle Dedicatory\" he\r\ndiscusses the art of translation with an intelligence which proves how\r\nintimately he realized the excellent quality of Hickes's version. \"For\r\nas the Painter,\" thus Jasper Mayne, \"who would draw a man of a bald\r\nhead, rumpled forehead, copper nose, pigge eyes, and ugly face, draws\r\nhim not to life, nor doth the business of his art, if he draw him less\r\ndeformed or ugly than he is; or as he who would draw a faire, amiable\r\nlady, limbes with an erring pencil, and drawes a libell, not a face, if\r\nhe gives her not just features, and perfections: So in the Translation\r\nof Bookes, he who makes a dull author elegant and quick; or a sharp,\r\nelegant author flat, rustick, rude and dull, by contrary wayes, commits\r\nthe same sinne, and cannot be said to translate, but to transforme.\"\r\nThat is sound sense, and judged by the high standard of Jasper Mayne,\r\nFrancis Hickes has most valiantly acquitted himself.\r\n\r\nHe was the son of Richard Hickes, an arras-weaver of Barcheston, in\r\nWarwickshire, and after taking the degree of bachelor in the University\r\nof Oxford, which he entered in 1579, at the age of thirteen, he was\r\ndiverted (says Thomas, his son) \"by a country retirement.\" Henceforth\r\nhe devoted his life to husbandry and Greek. Besides Lucian, he\r\ntranslated Thucydides and Herodian, the manuscripts of which are said\r\nto survive in the library of Christ Church. Possibly it was his long\r\nretirement that gave a turn of pedantry to his mind. It was but natural\r\nthat in his remote garden he should exaggerate the importance of the\r\nknowledge acquired in patient solitude. But certain it is that the\r\nnotes wherewith he decorated his margins are triumphs of inapposite\r\nerudition. When Lucian describes the famous cobwebs, each one of which\r\nwas as big as an island of the Cyclades, Hickes thinks to throw light\r\nupon the text with this astonishing irrelevancy: \"They are in the\r\nAegean Sea, in number 13.\" The foible is harmless, nay pleasant, and\r\nconsonant with the character of the learned recluse. Thus lived Francis\r\nHickes, silent and unknown, until in 1630 he died at a kinsman's house\r\nat Sutton in Gloucestershire. And you regret that his glory was merely\r\nposthumous. For, pedant as he was, he made known to his countrymen\r\nthe enemy of all the pedants, and turned a masterpiece of Greek into\r\nEnglish as sound and scholarly as is found in any translator of his\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Πῶς δεΐ ἰστορίαύ συγγράΦειν.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Πρὸς τὸν παιδευτὸν καὶ πὸλλα ὠνούμενον]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLUCIAN'S TRUE HISTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLUCIAN:\r\n\r\nHIS TRUE HISTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nEven as champions and wrestlers and such as practise the strength and\r\nagility of body are not only careful to retain a sound constitution of\r\nhealth, and to hold on their ordinary course of exercise, but sometimes\r\nalso to recreate themselves with seasonable intermission, and esteem it\r\nas a main point of their practice; so I think it necessary for scholars\r\nand such as addict themselves to the study of learning, after they have\r\ntravelled long in the perusal of serious authors, to relax a little\r\nthe intention of their thoughts, that they may be more apt and able to\r\nendure a continued course of study.\r\n\r\nAnd this kind of repose will be the more conformable, and fit their\r\npurpose better, if it be employed in the reading of such works as shall\r\nnot only yield a bare content by the pleasing and comely composure\r\nof them, but shall also give occasion of some learned speculation to\r\nthe mind, which I suppose I have effected in these books of mine:\r\nwherein not only the novelty of the subject, nor the pleasingness of\r\nthe project, may tickle the reader with delight, nor to hear so many\r\nnotorious lies delivered persuasively and in the way of truth, but\r\nbecause everything here by me set down doth in a comical fashion glance\r\nat some or other of the old poets, historiographers, and philosophers,\r\nwhich in their writings have recorded many monstrous and intolerable\r\nuntruths, whose names I would have quoted down, but that I knew the\r\nreading would bewray them to you.\r\n\r\nCtesias, the son of Ctesiochus, the Cnidian, wrote of the region of the\r\nIndians and the state of those countries, matters which he neither saw\r\nhimself, nor ever heard come from the mouth of any man. Iambulus also\r\nwrote many strange miracles of the great sea, which all men knew to be\r\nlies and fictions, yet so composed that they want not their delight:\r\nand many others have made choice of the like argument, of which some\r\nhave published their own travels and peregrinations, wherein they have\r\ndescribed the greatness of beasts, the fierce condition of men, with\r\ntheir strange and uncouth manner of life: but the first father and\r\nfounder of all this foolery was Homer's Ulysses, who tells a long tale\r\nto Alcinous of the servitude of the winds, and of wild men with one\r\neye in their foreheads that fed upon raw flesh, of beasts with many\r\nheads, and the transformation of his friends by enchanted potions, all\r\nwhich he made the silly Phæakes believe for great sooth.\r\n\r\nThis coming to my perusal, I could not condemn ordinary men for\r\nlying, when I saw it in request amongst them that would be counted\r\nphilosophical persons: yet could not but wonder at them, that, writing\r\nso manifest lies, they should not think to be taken with the manner;\r\nand this made me also ambitious to leave some monument of myself behind\r\nme, that I might not be the only man exempted from this liberty of\r\nlying: and because I had no matter of verity to employ my pen in (for\r\nnothing hath befallen me worth the writing), I turned my style to\r\npublish untruths, but with an honester mind than others have done: for\r\nthis one thing I confidently pronounce for a truth, that I lie: and\r\nthis, I hope, may be an excuse for all the rest, when I confess what I\r\nam faulty in: for I write of matters which I neither saw nor suffered,\r\nnor heard by report from others, which are in no being, nor possible\r\never to have a beginning. Let no man therefore in any case give any\r\ncredit to them.\r\n\r\nDisanchoring on a time from the pillars of Hercules, the wind fitting\r\nme well for my purpose, I thrust into the West Ocean. The occasion that\r\nmoved me to take such a voyage in hand was only a curiosity of mind,\r\na desire of novelties, and a longing to learn out the bounds of the\r\nocean, and what people inhabit the farther shore: for which purpose\r\nI made plentiful provision of victuals and fresh water, got fifty\r\ncompanions of the same humour to associate me in my travels, furnished\r\nmyself with store of munition, gave a round sum of money to an expert\r\npilot that could direct us in our course, and new rigged and repaired a\r\ntall ship strongly to hold a tedious and difficult journey.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThus sailed we forward a day and a night with a prosperous wind, and\r\nas long as we had any sight of land, made no great haste on our way;\r\nbut the next morrow about sun rising the wind blew high and the waves\r\nbegan to swell and a darkness fell upon us, so that we could not see to\r\nstrike our sails, but gave our ship over to the wind and weather; thus\r\nwere we tossed in this tempest the space of threescore and nineteen\r\ndays together. On the fourscorth day the sun upon a sudden brake out,\r\nand we descried not far off us an island full of mountains and woods,\r\nabout the which the seas did not rage so boisterously, for the storm\r\nwas now reasonably well calmed: there we thrust in and went on shore\r\nand cast ourselves upon the ground, and so lay a long time, as utterly\r\ntired with our misery at sea: in the end we arose up and divided\r\nourselves: thirty we left to guard our ship: myself and twenty more\r\nwent to discover the island, and had not gone above three furlongs from\r\nthe sea through a wood, but we saw a brazen pillar erected, whereupon\r\nGreek letters were engraven, though now much worn and hard to be\r\ndiscerned, importing, \"Thus far travelled Hercules and Bacchus.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: img002] There were also near unto the place two\r\nportraitures cut out in a rock, the one of the quantity of an acre of\r\nground, the other less, which made me imagine the lesser to be Bacchus\r\nand the other Hercules: and giving them due adoration, we proceeded on\r\nour journey, and far we had not gone but we came to a river, the stream\r\nwhereof seemed to run with as rich wine as any is made in Chios, and\r\nof a great breadth, in some places able to bear a ship, which made me\r\nto give the more credit to the inscription upon the pillar, when I saw\r\nsuch apparent signs of Bacchus's peregrination. We then resolved to\r\ntravel up the stream to find whence the river had his original, and\r\nwhen we were come to the head, no spring at all appeared, but mighty\r\ngreat vine-trees of infinite number, which from their roots distilled\r\npure wine which made the river run so abundantly: the stream was also\r\nwell stored with fish, of which we took a few, in taste and colour much\r\nresembling wine, but as many as ate of them fell drunk upon it; for\r\nwhen they were opened and cut up, we found them to be full of lees:\r\nafterwards we mixed some fresh water fish with them, which allayed the\r\nstrong taste of the wine. We then crossed the stream where we found it\r\npassable, and came among a world of vines of incredible number, which\r\ntowards the earth had firm stocks and of a good growth; but the tops\r\nof them were women, from the hip upwards, having all their proportion\r\nperfect and complete; as painters picture out Daphne, who was turned\r\ninto a tree when she was overtaken by Apollo; at their fingers' ends\r\nsprung out branches full of grapes, and the hair of their heads was\r\nnothing else but winding wires and leaves, and clusters of grapes.\r\nWhen we were come to them, they saluted us and joined hands with us,\r\nand spake unto us some in the Lydian and some in the Indian language,\r\nbut most of them in Greek: they also kissed us with their mouths, but\r\nhe that was so kissed fell drunk, and was not his own man a good while\r\nafter: they could not abide to have any fruit pulled from them, but\r\nwould roar and cry out pitifully if any man offered it. Some of them\r\ndesired to have carnal mixture with us, and two of our company were so\r\nbold as to entertain their offer, and could never afterwards be loosed\r\nfrom them, but were knit fast together at their nether parts, from\r\nwhence they grew together and took root together, and their fingers\r\nbegan to spring out with branches and crooked wires as if they were\r\nready to bring out fruit: whereupon we forsook them and fled to our\r\nships, and told the company at our coming what had betide unto us, how\r\nour fellows were entangled, and of their copulation with the vines.\r\nThen we took certain of our vessels and filled them, some with water\r\nand some with wine out of the river, and lodged for that night near the\r\nshore.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOn the morrow we put to sea again, the wind serving us weakly, but\r\nabout noon, when we had lost sight of the island, upon a sudden a\r\nwhirlwind caught us, which turned our ship round about, and lifted us\r\nup some three thousand furlongs into the air, and suffered us not to\r\nsettle again into the sea, but we hung above ground, and were carried\r\naloft with a mighty wind which filled our sails strongly. Thus for\r\nseven days' space and so many nights were we driven along in that\r\nmanner, and on the eighth day we came in view of a great country in\r\nthe air, like to a shining island, of a round proportion, gloriously\r\nglittering with light, and approaching to it, we there arrived, and\r\ntook land, and surveying the country, we found it to be both inhabited\r\nand husbanded: and as long as the day lasted we could see nothing\r\nthere, but when night was come many other islands appeared unto us,\r\nsome greater and some less, all of the colour of fire, and another kind\r\nof earth underneath, in which were cities and seas and rivers and woods\r\nand mountains, which we conjectured to be the earth by us inhabited:\r\nand going further into the land, we were met withal and taken by those\r\nkind of people which they call Hippogypians. These Hippogypians are\r\nmen riding upon monstrous vultures, which they use instead of horses:\r\nfor the vultures there are exceeding great, every one with three heads\r\napiece: you may imagine their greatness by this, for every feather in\r\ntheir wings was bigger and longer than the mast of a tall ship: their\r\ncharge was to fly about the country, and all the strangers they found\r\nto bring them to the king: and their fortune was then to seize upon\r\nus, and by them we were presented to him. As soon as he saw us, he\r\nconjectured by our habit what countrymen we were, and said, Are not\r\nyou, strangers, Grecians? which when we affirmed, And how could you\r\nmake way, said he, through so much air as to get hither?\r\n\r\nThen we delivered the whole discourse of our fortunes to him; whereupon\r\nhe began to tell us likewise of his own adventures, how that he also\r\nwas a man, by name Endymion, and rapt up long since from the earth\r\nas he was asleep, and brought hither, where he was made king of the\r\ncountry, and said it was that region which to us below seemed to be\r\nthe moon; but he bade us be of good cheer and fear no danger, for we\r\nshould want nothing we stood in need of: and if the war he was now\r\nin hand withal against the sun succeeded fortunately, we should live\r\nwith him in the highest degree of happiness. Then we asked of him\r\nwhat enemies he had, and the cause of the quarrel: and he answered,\r\nPhaethon, the king of the inhabitants of the sun (for that is also\r\npeopled as well as the moon), hath made war against us a long time\r\nupon this occasion: I once assembled all the poor people and needy\r\npersons within my dominions, purposing to send a colony to inhabit the\r\nMorning Star, because the country was desert and had nobody dwelling\r\nin it. This Phaethon envying, crossed me in my design, and sent his\r\nHippomyrmicks to meet with us in the midway, by whom we were surprised\r\nat that time, being not prepared for an encounter, and were forced to\r\nretire: now therefore my purpose is once again to denounce war and\r\npublish a plantation of people there: if therefore you will participate\r\nwith us in our expedition, I will furnish you every one with a prime\r\nvulture and all armour answerable for service, for to-morrow we must\r\nset forwards. With all our hearts, said I, if it please you. Then\r\nwere we feasted and abode with him, and in the morning arose to set\r\nourselves in-order of battle, for our scouts had given us knowledge\r\nthat the enemy was at hand. Our forces in number amounted to an\r\nhundred thousand, besides such as bare burthens and engineers, and\r\nthe foot forces and the strange aids: of these, fourscore thousand\r\nwere Hippogypians, and twenty thousand that rode upon Lachanopters,\r\nwhich is a mighty great fowl, and instead of feathers covered thick\r\nover with wort leaves; but their wing feathers were much like the\r\nleaves of lettuces: after them were placed the Cenchrobolians and\r\nthe Scorodomachians: there came also to aid us from the Bear Star\r\nthirty thousand Psyllotoxotans, and fifty thousand Anemodromians:\r\nthese Psyllotoxotans ride upon great fleas, of which they have their\r\ndenomination, for every flea among them is as big as a dozen elephants:\r\nthe Anemodromians are footmen, yet flew in the air without feathers in\r\nthis manner: every man had a large mantle reaching down to his foot,\r\nwhich the wind blowing against, filled it like a sail, and they were\r\ncarried along as if they had been boats: the most part of these in\r\nfight were targeteers. It was said also that there were expected from\r\nthe stars over Cappadocia threescore and ten thousand Struthobalanians\r\nand five thousand Hippogeranians, but I had no sight of them, for\r\nthey were not yet come, and therefore I durst write nothing, though\r\nwonderful and incredible reports were given out of them. This was\r\nthe number of Endymion's army; the furniture was all alike; their\r\nhelmets of bean hulls, which are great with them and very strong;\r\ntheir breastplates all of lupins cut into scales, for they take the\r\nshells of lupins, and fastening them together, make breastplates of\r\nthem which are impenetrable and as hard as any horn: their shields\r\nand swords like to ours in Greece: and when the time of battle was\r\ncome, they were ordered in this manner. The right wing was supplied\r\nby the Hippogypians, where the king himself was in person with the\r\nchoicest soldiers in the army, among whom we also were ranged: the\r\nLachanopters made the left wing, and the aids were placed in the main\r\nbattle as every man's fortune fell: the foot, which in number were\r\nabout six thousand myriads, were disposed of in this manner: there are\r\nmany spiders in those parts of mighty bigness, every one in quantity\r\nexceeding one of the Islands Cyclades: these were appointed to spin a\r\nweb in the air between the Moon and the Morning Star, which was done in\r\nan instant, and made a plain champaign upon which the foot forces were\r\nplanted, who had for their leader Nycterion, the son of Eudianax, and\r\ntwo other associates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBut of the enemy's side the left wing consisted of the Hippomyrmicks,\r\nand among them Phaethon himself: these are beasts of huge bigness\r\nand winged, carrying the resemblance of our emmets, but for their\r\ngreatness: for those of the largest size were of the quantity of two\r\nacres, and not only the riders supplied the place of soldiers, but\r\nthey also did much mischief with their horns: they were in number\r\nfifty thousand. In the right wing were ranged the Aeroconopes, of\r\nwhich there were also about fifty thousand, all archers riding upon\r\ngreat gnats: then followed the Aerocardakes, who were light armed and\r\nfootmen, but good soldiers, casting out of slings afar off huge great\r\nturnips, and whosoever was hit with them lived not long after, but died\r\nwith the stink that proceeded from their wounds: it is said they use to\r\nanoint their bullets with the poison of mallows. After them were placed\r\nthe Caulomycetes, men-at-arms and good at hand strokes, in number about\r\nfifty thousand: they are called Caulomycetes because their shields\r\nwere made of mushrooms and their spears of the stalks of the herb\r\nasparagus: near unto them were placed the Cynobalanians, that were sent\r\nfrom the Dogstar to aid him: these were men with dogs' faces, riding\r\nupon winged acorns: but the slingers that should have come out of _Via\r\nLactea_, and the Nephelocentaurs came too short of these aids, for the\r\nbattle was done before their arrival, so that they did them no good:\r\nand indeed the slingers came not at all, wherefore they say Phaethon\r\nin displeasure over-ran their country. These were the forces that\r\nPhaethon brought into the field: and when they were joined in battle,\r\nafter the signal was given, and when the asses on either side had\r\nbrayed (for these are to them instead of trumpets), the fight began,\r\nand the left wing of the Heliotans, or Sun soldiers, fled presently\r\nand would not abide to receive the charge of the Hippogypians, but\r\nturned their backs immediately, and many were put to the sword: but\r\nthe right wing of theirs were too hard for our left wing, and drove\r\nthem back till they came to our footmen, who joining with them, made\r\nthe enemies there also turn their backs and fly, especially when they\r\nfound their own left wing to be overthrown. Thus were they wholly\r\ndiscomfited on all hands; many were taken prisoners, and many slain;\r\nmuch blood was spilt; some fell upon the clouds, which made them look\r\nof a red colour, as sometimes they appear to us about sun-setting;\r\nsome dropped down upon the earth, which made me suppose it was upon\r\nsome such occasion that Homer thought Jupiter rained blood for the\r\ndeath of his son Sarpedon. Returning from the pursuit, we erected two\r\ntrophies: one for the fight on foot, which we placed upon the spiders'\r\nweb: the other for the fight in the air, which we set up upon the\r\nclouds. As soon as this was done, news came to us by our scouts that\r\nthe Nephelocentaurs were coming on, which indeed should have come to\r\nPhaethon before the fight. And when they drew so near unto us that we\r\ncould take full view of them, it was a strange sight to behold such\r\nmonsters, composed of flying horses and men: that part which resembled\r\nmankind, which was from the waist upwards, did equal in greatness\r\nthe Rhodian Colossus, and that which was like a horse was as big as\r\na great ship of burden: and of such multitude that I was fearful to\r\nset down their number lest it might be taken for a lie: and for their\r\nleader they had the Sagittarius out of the Zodiac. When they heard that\r\ntheir friends were foiled, they sent a messenger to Phaethon to renew\r\nthe fight: whereupon they set themselves in array, and fell upon the\r\nSelenitans or the Moon soldiers that were troubled, and disordered in\r\nfollowing the chase, and scattered in gathering the spoils, and put\r\nthem all to flight, and pursued the king into his city, and killed the\r\ngreatest part of his birds, overturned the trophies he had set up, and\r\novercame the whole country that was spun by the spiders. Myself and\r\ntwo of my companions were taken alive. When Phaethon himself was come\r\nthey set up other trophies in token of victory, and on the morrow we\r\nwere carried prisoners into the Sun, our arms bound behind us with a\r\npiece of the cobweb: yet would they by no means lay any siege to the\r\ncity, but returned and built up a wall in the midst of the air to keep\r\nthe light of the Sun from falling upon the Moon, and they made it a\r\ndouble wall, wholly compact of clouds, so that a manifest eclipse of\r\nthe Moon ensued, and all things detained in perpetual night: wherewith\r\nEndymion was so much oppressed that he sent ambassadors to entreat\r\nthe demolishing of the building, and beseech him that he would not\r\ndamn them to live in darkness, promising to pay him tribute, to be his\r\nfriend and associate, and never after to stir against him. Phaethon's\r\ncouncil twice assembled to consider upon this offer, and in their first\r\nmeeting would remit nothing of their conceived displeasure, but on the\r\nmorrow they altered their minds to these terms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"The Heliotans and their colleagues have made a peace with the\r\nSelenitans and their associates upon these conditions, that the\r\nHeliotans shall cast down the wall, and deliver the prisoners that\r\nthey have taken upon a ratable ransom: and that the Selenitans should\r\nleave the other stars at liberty, and raise no war against the\r\nHeliotans, but aid and assist one another if either of them should\r\nbe invaded: that the king of the Selenitans should yearly pay to the\r\nking of the Heliotans in way of tribute ten thousand vessels of dew,\r\nand deliver ten thousand of their people to be pledges for their\r\nfidelity: that the colony to be sent to the Morning Star should be\r\njointly supplied by them both, and liberty given to any else that\r\nwould to be sharers in it: that these articles of peace should be\r\nengraven in a pillar of amber, to be erected in the midst of the air\r\nupon the confines of their country: for the performance whereof were\r\nsworn of the Heliotans, Pyronides and Therites and Phlogius: and of\r\nthe Selenitans, Nyctor and Menius and Polylampes.\" Thus was the peace\r\nconcluded, the wall immediately demolished, and we that were prisoners\r\ndelivered. Being returned into the Moon, they came forth to meet us,\r\nEndymion himself and all his friends, who embraced us with tears,\r\nand desired us to make our abode with him, and to be partners in the\r\ncolony, promising to give me his own son in marriage (for there are no\r\nwomen amongst them), which I by no means would yield unto, but desired\r\nof all loves to be dismissed again into the sea, and he finding it\r\nimpossible to persuade us to his purpose, after seven days' feasting,\r\ngave us leave to depart.\r\n\r\nNow, what strange novelties worthy of note I observed during the time\r\nof my abode there, I will relate unto you. The first is, that they\r\nare not begotten of women, but of mankind: for they have no other\r\nmarriage but of males: the name of women is utterly unknown among\r\nthem: until they accomplish the age of five and twenty years, they are\r\ngiven in marriage to others: from that time forwards they take others\r\nin marriage to themselves: for as soon as the infant is conceived the\r\nleg begins to swell, and afterwards when the time of birth is come,\r\nthey give it a lance and take it out dead: then they lay it abroad\r\nwith open mouth towards the wind, and so it takes life: and I think\r\nthereof the Grecians call it the belly of the leg, because therein\r\nthey bear their children instead of a belly. I will tell you now of\r\na thing more strange than this. There are a kind of men among them\r\ncalled Dendritans, which are begotten in this manner: they cut out the\r\nright stone out of a man's cod, and set it in their ground, from which\r\nspringeth up a great tree of flesh, with branches and leaves, bearing\r\na kind of fruit much like to an acorn, but of a cubit in length, which\r\nthey gather when they are ripe, and cut men out of them: their privy\r\nmembers are to be set on and taken off as they have occasion: rich men\r\nhave them made of ivory, poor men of wood, wherewith they perform the\r\nact of generation and accompany their spouses.\r\n\r\nWhen a man is come to his full age he dieth not, but is dissolved like\r\nsmoke and is turned into air. One kind of food is common to them all,\r\nfor they kindle a fire and broil frogs upon the coals, which are\r\nwith them in infinite numbers flying in the air, and whilst they are\r\nbroiling, they sit round about them as it were about a table, and lap\r\nup the smoke that riseth from them, and feast themselves therewith,\r\nand this is all their feeding. For their drink they have air beaten\r\nin a mortar, which yieldeth a kind of moisture much like unto dew.\r\nThey have no avoidance of excrements, either of urine or dung, neither\r\nhave they any issue for that purpose like unto us. Their boys admit\r\ncopulation, not like unto ours, but in their hams, a little above the\r\ncalf of the leg, for there they are open. They hold it a great ornament\r\nto be bald, for hairy persons are abhorred with them, and yet among\r\nthe stars that are comets it is thought commendable, as some that have\r\ntravelled those coasts reported unto us. Such beards as they have are\r\ngrowing a little above their knees. They have no nails on their feet,\r\nfor their whole foot is all but one toe. Every one of them at the point\r\nof his rump hath a long colewort growing out instead of a tail, always\r\ngreen and flourishing, which though a man fall upon his back, cannot\r\nbe broken. The dropping of their noses is more sweet than honey. When\r\nthey labour or exercise themselves, they anoint their body with milk,\r\nwherein to if a little of that honey chance to drop, it will be turned\r\ninto cheese. They make very fat oil of their beans, and of as delicate\r\na savour as any sweet ointment. They have many vines in those parts,\r\nwhich yield them but water: for the grapes that hang upon the clusters\r\nare like our hailstones: and I verily think that when the vines there\r\nare shaken with a strong wind, there falls a storm of hail amongst us\r\nby the breaking down of those kind of berries. Their bellies stand them\r\ninstead of satchels to put in their necessaries, which they may open\r\nand shut at their pleasure, for they have neither liver nor any kind\r\nof entrails, only they are rough and hairy within, so that when their\r\nyoung children are cold, they may be enclosed therein to keep them\r\nwarm. The rich men have garments of glass, very soft and delicate: the\r\npoorer sort of brass woven, whereof they have great plenty, which they\r\nenseam with water to make it fit for the workman, as we do our wool.\r\nIf I should write what manner of eyes they have, I doubt I should be\r\ntaken for a liar in publishing a matter so incredible: yet I cannot\r\nchoose but tell it: for they have eyes to take in and out as please\r\nthemselves: and when a man is so disposed, he may take them out and lay\r\nthem by till he have occasion to use them, and then put them in and see\r\nagain: many when they have lost their own eyes, borrow of others, for\r\nthe rich have many lying by them. Their ears are all made of the leaves\r\nof plane-trees, excepting those that come of acorns, for they only have\r\nthem made of wood.\r\n\r\nI saw also another strange thing in the same court: a mighty great\r\nglass lying upon the top of a pit of no great depth, whereinto, if any\r\nman descend, he shall hear everything that is spoken upon the earth: if\r\nhe but look into the glass, he shall see all cities and all nations as\r\nwell as if he were among them. There had I the sight of all my friends\r\nand the whole country about: whether they saw me or not I cannot tell:\r\nbut if they believe it not to be so, let them take the pains to go\r\nthither themselves and they shall find my words true. Then we took our\r\nleaves of the king and such as were near him, and took shipping and\r\ndeparted: at which time Endymion bestowed upon me two mantles made of\r\ntheir glass, and five of brass, with a complete armour of those shells\r\nof lupins, all which I left behind me in the whale: and sent with us\r\na thousand of his Hippogypians to conduct us five hundred furlongs on\r\nour way. In our course we coasted many other countries, and lastly\r\narrived at the Morning Star now newly inhabited, where we landed and\r\ntook in fresh water: from thence we entered the Zodiac, passing by the\r\nSun, and, leaving it on our right hand, took our course near unto\r\nthe shore, but landed not in the country, though our company did much\r\ndesire it, for the wind would not give us leave: but we saw it was a\r\nflourishing region, fat and well watered, abounding with all delights:\r\nbut the Nephelocentaurs espying us, who were mercenary soldiers to\r\nPhaethon, made to our ship as fast as they could, and finding us to\r\nbe friends, said no more unto us, for our Hippogypians were departed\r\nbefore. Then we made forwards all the next night and day, and about\r\nevening-tide following we came to a city called Lychnopolis, still\r\nholding on our course downwards. This city is seated in the air between\r\nthe Pleiades and the Hyades, somewhat lower than the Zodiac, and\r\narriving there, not a man was to be seen, but lights in great numbers\r\nrunning to and fro, which were employed, some in the market place, and\r\nsome about the haven, of which many were little, and as a man may say,\r\nbut poor things; some again were great and mighty, exceeding glorious\r\nand resplendent, and there were places of receipt for them all; every\r\none had his name as well as men; and we did hear them speak. These did\r\nus no harm, but invited us to feast with them, yet we were so fearful,\r\nthat we durst neither eat nor sleep as long as we were there. Their\r\ncourt of justice standeth in the midst of the city, where the governor\r\nsitteth all the night long calling every one by name, and he that\r\nanswereth not is adjudged to die, as if he had forsaken his ranks.\r\nTheir death is to be quenched. We also standing amongst them saw what\r\nwas done, and heard what answers the lights made for themselves, and\r\nthe reasons they alleged for tarrying so long: there we also knew our\r\nown light, and spake unto it, and questioned it of our affairs at\r\nhome, and how all did there, which related everything unto us. That\r\nnight we made our abode there, and on the next morrow returned to\r\nour ship, and sailing near unto the clouds had a sight of the city\r\nNephelococcygia, which we beheld with great wonder, but entered not\r\ninto it, for the wind was against us. The king thereof was Coronus,\r\nthe son of Cottyphion: and I could not choose but think upon the poet\r\nAristophanes, how wise a man he was, and how true a reporter, and how\r\nlittle cause there is to question his fidelity for what he hath written.\r\n\r\nThe third after, the ocean appeared plainly unto us, though we could\r\nsee no land but what was in the air, and those countries also seemed\r\nto be fiery and of a glittering colour. The fourth day about noon,\r\nthe wind gently forbearing, settled us fair and leisurely into the\r\nsea; and as soon as we found ourselves upon water, we were surprised\r\nwith incredible gladness, and our joy was unexpressible; we feasted\r\nand made merry with such provision as we had; we cast ourselves into\r\nthe sea, and swam up and down for our disport, for it was a calm.\r\nBut oftentimes it falleth out that the change to the better is the\r\nbeginning of greater evils: for when we had made only two days' sail in\r\nthe water, as soon as the third day appeared, about sun-rising, upon a\r\nsudden we saw many monstrous fishes and whales: but one above the rest,\r\ncontaining in greatness fifteen hundred furlongs, which came gaping\r\nupon us and troubled the sea round about him, so that he was compassed\r\non every side with froth and foam, showing his teeth afar off, which\r\nwere longer than any beech trees are with us, all as sharp as needles,\r\nand as white as ivory: then we took, as we thought, our last leaves\r\none of another, and embracing together, expected our ending day. The\r\nmonster was presently with us, and swallowed us up ship and all; but by\r\nchance he caught us not between his chops, for the ship slipped through\r\nthe void passages down into his entrails. When we were thus got within\r\nhim we continued a good while in darkness, and could see nothing till\r\nhe began to gape, and then we perceived it to be a monstrous whale of\r\na huge breadth and height, big enough to contain a city that would\r\nhold ten thousand men: and within we found small fishes and many other\r\ncreatures chopped in pieces, and the masts of ships and anchors and\r\nbones of men and luggage. In the midst of him was earth and hills,\r\nwhich were raised, as I conjectured, by the settling of the mud which\r\ncame down his throat, for woods grew upon them and trees of all sorts\r\nand all manner of herbs, and it looked as if it had been husbanded.\r\nThe compass of the land was two hundred and forty furlongs: there were\r\nalso to be seen all kind of sea fowl, as gulls, halcyons and others\r\nthat had made their nests upon the trees. Then we fell to weeping\r\nabundantly, but at the last I roused up my company, and propped up our\r\nship and struck fire. Then we made ready supper of such as we had, for\r\nabundance of all sort of fish lay ready by us, and we had yet water\r\nenough left which we brought out of the Morning Star.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morrow we rose to watch when the whale should gape: and then\r\nlooking out, we could sometimes see mountains, sometimes only the\r\nskies, and many times islands, for we found that the fish carried\r\nhimself with great swiftness to every part of the sea. When we grew\r\nweary of this, I took seven of my company, and went into the wood to\r\nsee what I could find there, and we had not gone above five furlongs\r\nbut we light upon a temple erected to Neptune, as by the title\r\nappeared, and not far off we espied many sepulchres and pillars placed\r\nupon them, with a fountain of clear water close unto it: we also heard\r\nthe barking of a dog, and saw smoke rise afar off, so that we judged\r\nthere was some dwelling thereabout. Wherefore making the more haste,\r\nwe lighted upon an old man and a youth, who were very busy in making a\r\ngarden and in conveying water by a channel from the fountain into it:\r\nwhereupon we were surprised both with joy and fear: and they also were\r\nbrought into the same taking, and for a long time remained mute. But\r\nafter some pause, the old man said, What are ye, you strangers? any of\r\nthe sea spirits? or miserable men like unto us? for we that are men by\r\nnature, born and bred in the earth, are now sea-dwellers, and swim up\r\nand down within the Continent of this whale, and know not certainly\r\nwhat to think of ourselves: we are like to men that be dead, and yet\r\nbelieve ourselves to be alive. Whereunto I answered, For our parts,\r\nfather, we are men also, newly come hither, and swallowed up ship and\r\nall but yesterday: and now come purposely within this wood which is\r\nso large and thick: some good angel, I think, did guide us hither to\r\nhave the sight of you, and to make us know that we are not the only\r\nmen confined within this monster: tell us therefore your fortunes, we\r\nbeseech you, what you are, and how you came into this place. But he\r\nanswered, You shall not hear a word from me, nor ask any more questions\r\nuntil you have taken part of such viands as we are able to afford you.\r\nSo he took us and brought us into his house, which was sufficient to\r\nserve his turn: his pallets were prepared, and all things else made\r\nready. Then he set before us herbs and nuts and fish, and filled out of\r\nhis own wine unto us: and when we were sufficiently satisfied, he then\r\ndemanded of us what fortunes we had endured, and I related all things\r\nto him in order that had betide unto us, the tempest, the passages in\r\nthe island, our navigation in the air, our war, and all the rest, even\r\ntill our diving into the whale. Whereat he wondered exceedingly, and\r\nbegan to deliver also what had befallen to him, and said, By lineage,\r\nO ye strangers, I am of the isle Cyprus, and travelling from mine own\r\ncountry as a merchant, with this my son you see here, and many other\r\nfriends with me, made a voyage for Italy in a great ship full fraught\r\nwith merchandise, which perhaps you have seen broken in pieces in the\r\nmouth of the whale. We sailed with fair weather till we were as far\r\nas Sicily, but there we were overtaken with such a boisterous storm\r\nthat the third day we were driven into the ocean, where it was our\r\nfortune to meet with this whale which swallowed us all up, and only we\r\ntwo escaped with our lives; all the rest perished, whom we have here\r\nburied and built a temple to Neptune. Ever since we have continued this\r\ncourse of life, planting herbs and feeding upon fish and nuts: here is\r\nwood enough, you see, and plenty of vines which yield most delicate\r\nwine: we have also a well of excellent cool water, which it may be you\r\nhave seen: we make our beds of the leaves of trees, and burn as much\r\nwood as we will: we chase after the birds that fly about us, and go\r\nout upon the gills of the monster to catch after live fishes: here we\r\nbathe ourselves when we are disposed, for we have a lake of salt water\r\nnot far off, about some twenty furlongs in compass, full of sundry\r\nsorts of fish, in which we swim and sail upon it in a little boat of\r\nmine own making. This is the seven-and-twentieth year of our drowning,\r\nand with all this we might be well enough contented if our neighbours\r\nand borderers about us were not perverse and troublesome, altogether\r\ninsociable and of stern condition. Is it so, indeed, said I, that there\r\nshould be any within the whale but yourselves? Many, said he, and such\r\nas are unreconcilable towards strangers, and of monstrous and deformed\r\nproportions. The western countries and the tail-part of the wood are\r\ninhabited by the Tarychanians that look like eels, with faces like\r\na lobster: these are warlike, fierce, and feed upon raw flesh: they\r\nthat dwell towards the right side are called Tritonomendetans, which\r\nhave their upper parts like unto men, their lower parts like cats,\r\nand are less offensive than the rest. On the left side inhabit the\r\nCarcinochirians and the Thinnocephalians, which are in league one with\r\nanother: the middle region is possessed by the Paguridians, and the\r\nPsettopodians, a warlike nation and swift of foot: eastwards towards\r\nthe mouth is for the most part desert, as overwashed by the sea: yet am\r\nI fain to take that for my dwelling, paying yearly to the Psettopodians\r\nin way of tribute five hundred oysters.\r\n\r\nOf so many nations doth this country consist. We must therefore devise\r\namong ourselves either how to be able to fight with them, or how to\r\nlive among them. What number may they all amount unto? said I. More\r\nthan a thousand, said he. And what armour have they? None at all, said\r\nhe, but the bones of fishes. Then were it our best course, said I, to\r\nencounter them, being provided as we are, and they without weapons,\r\nfor if we prove too hard for them we shall afterward live out of fear.\r\nThis we concluded upon, and went to our ship to furnish ourselves with\r\narms. The occasion of war we gave by non-payment of tribute, which\r\nthen was due, for they sent their messengers to demand it, to whom he\r\ngave a harsh and scornful answer, and sent them packing with their\r\narrant. But the Psettopodians and Paguridians, taking it ill at the\r\nhands of Scintharus, for so was the man named, came against us with\r\ngreat tumult: and we, suspecting what they would do, stood upon our\r\nguard to wait for them, and laid five-and-twenty of our men in ambush,\r\ncommanding them as soon as the enemy was passed by to set upon them,\r\nwho did so, and arose out of their ambush, and fell upon the rear.\r\nWe also being five-and-twenty in number (for Scintharus and his son\r\nwere marshalled among us) advanced to meet with them, and encountered\r\nthem with great courage and strength: but in the end we put them to\r\nflight and pursued them to their very dens. Of the enemies were slain\r\nan hundred threescore and ten, and but one of us besides Trigles, our\r\npilot, who was thrust through the back with a fish's rib. All that day\r\nfollowing and the night after we lodged in our trenches, and set on end\r\na dry backbone of a dolphin instead of a trophy.\r\n\r\nThe next morrow the rest of the country people, perceiving what had\r\nhappened, came to assault us. The Tarychanians were ranged in the\r\nright wing, with Pelamus their captain: the Thinnocephalians were\r\nplaced in the left wing: the Carcinochirians made up the main battle:\r\nfor the Tritonomendetans stirred not, neither would they join with\r\neither part. About the temple of Neptune we met with them, and joined\r\nfight with a great cry, which was answered with an echo out of the\r\nwhale as if it had been out of a cave: but we soon put them to flight,\r\nbeing naked people, and chased them into the wood, making ourselves\r\nmasters of the country. Soon after they sent ambassadors to us to crave\r\nthe bodies of the dead and to treat upon conditions of peace; but we\r\nhad no purpose to hold friendship with them, but set upon them the\r\nnext day and put them all to the sword except the Tritonomendetans,\r\nwho, seeing how it fared with the rest of their fellows, fled away\r\nthrough the gills of the fish, and cast themselves into the sea. Then\r\nwe travelled all the country over, which now was desert, and dwelt\r\nthere afterwards without fear of enemies, spending the time in exercise\r\nof the body and in hunting, in planting vineyards and gathering fruit\r\nof the trees, like such men as live delicately and have the world at\r\nwill, in a spacious and unavoidable prison. This kind of life led we\r\nfor a year and eight months, but when the fifth day of the ninth month\r\nwas come, about the time of the second opening of his mouth (for so\r\nthe whale did once every hour, whereby we conjectured how the hours\r\nwent away), I say about the second opening, upon a sudden we heard\r\na great cry and a mighty noise like the calls of mariners and the\r\nstirring of oars, which troubled us not a little. Wherefore we crept\r\nup to the very mouth of the fish, and standing within his teeth, saw\r\nthe strangest sight that ever eye beheld--men of monstrous greatness,\r\nhalf a furlong in stature, sailing upon mighty great islands as if they\r\nwere upon shipboard. I know you will think this smells like a lie,\r\nbut yet you shall have it. The islands were of a good length indeed,\r\nbut not very high, containing about an hundred furlongs in compass;\r\nevery one of these carried of those kind of men eight-and-twenty, of\r\nwhich some sat on either side of the island and rowed in their course\r\nwith great cypress trees, branches, leaves and all, instead of oars.\r\nOn the stern or hinder part, as I take it, stood the governor, upon\r\na high hill, with a brazen rudder of a furlong in length in his\r\nhand: on the fore-part stood forty such fellows as those, armed for\r\nthe fight, resembling men in all points but in their hair, which was\r\nall fire and burnt clearly, so that they needed no helmets. Instead\r\nof sails the wood growing in the island did serve their turns, for\r\nthe wind blowing against it drave forward the island like a ship,\r\nand carried it which way the governor would have it, for they had\r\npilots to direct them, and were as nimble to be stirred with oars as\r\nany long-boat. At the first we had the sight but of two or three of\r\nthem: afterwards appeared no less than six hundred, which, dividing\r\nthemselves in two parts, prepared for encounter, in which many of\r\nthem by meeting with their barks together were broken in pieces, many\r\nwere turned over and drowned: they that closed, fought lustily and\r\nwould not easily be parted, for the soldiers in the front showed a\r\ngreat deal of valour, entering one upon another, and killed all they\r\ncould, for none were taken prisoners. Instead of iron grapples they had\r\nmighty great polypodes fast tied, which they cast at the other, and\r\nif they once laid hold on the wood they made the isle sure enough for\r\nstirring. They darted and wounded one another with oysters that would\r\nfill a wain, and sponges as big as an acre. The leader on the one side\r\nwas Æolocentaurus, and of the other Thalassopotes. The quarrel, as it\r\nseems, grew about taking a booty: for they said that Thalassopotes\r\ndrave away many flocks of dolphins that belonged to Æolocentaurus, as\r\nwe heard by their clamours one to another, and calling upon the names\r\nof their kings: but Æolocentaurus had the better of the day and sunk\r\none hundred and fifty of the enemy's islands, and three they took with\r\nthe men and all. The rest withdrew themselves and fled, whom the other\r\npursued, but not far, because it grew towards evening, but returned to\r\nthose that were wrecked and broken, which they also recovered for the\r\nmost part, and took their own away with them: for on their part there\r\nwere no less than fourscore islands drowned. Then they erected a trophy\r\nfor a monument of this island fight, and fastened one of the enemy's\r\nislands with a stake upon the head of the whale. That night they lodged\r\nclose by the beast, casting their cables about him, and anchored near\r\nunto him: their anchors are huge and great, made of glass, but of a\r\nwonderful strength. The morrow after, when they had sacrificed upon\r\nthe top of the whale, and there buried their dead, they sailed away,\r\nwith great triumph and songs of victory. And this was the manner of the\r\nislands' fight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLUCIAN\r\n\r\nHIS TRUE HISTORY.\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND BOOK.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon this we began to be weary of our abode in the whale, and our\r\ntarriance there did much trouble us. We therefore set all our wits\r\na-work to find out some means or other to clear us from our captivity.\r\nFirst, we thought it would do well to dig a hole through his right\r\nside and make our escape that way forth, which we began to labour at\r\nlustily; but after we had pierced him five furlongs deep and found it\r\nwas to no purpose, we gave it over. Then we devised to set the wood\r\non fire, for that would certainly kill him without all question, and\r\nbeing once dead, our issue would be easy enough. This we also put in\r\npractice, and began our project at the tail end, which burnt seven days\r\nand as many nights before he had any feeling of our fireworks: upon\r\nthe eighth and ninth days we perceived he began to grow sickly: for he\r\ngaped more dully than he was wont to do, and sooner closed his mouth\r\nagain: the tenth and eleventh he was thoroughly mortified and began to\r\nstink: upon the twelfth day we bethought ourselves, though almost too\r\nlate, that unless we underpropped his chops when he gaped next to keep\r\nthem from closing, we should be in danger of perpetual imprisonment\r\nwithin his dead carcase and there miserably perish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWe therefore pitched long beams of timber upright within his mouth\r\nto keep it from shutting, and then made our ship in a readiness, and\r\nprovided ourselves with store of fresh water, and all other things\r\nnecessary for our use, Scintharus taking upon him to be our pilot, and\r\nthe next morrow the whale died. Then we hauled our ship through the\r\nvoid passages, and fastening cables about his teeth, by little and\r\nlittle settled it into the sea, and mounting the back of the whale,\r\nsacrificed to Neptune, and for three days together took up our lodging\r\nhard by the trophy, for we were becalmed. The fourth day we put to sea,\r\nand met with many dead corpses that perished in the late sea-fight,\r\nwhich our ship hit against, whose bodies we took measure of with great\r\nadmiration, and sailed for a few days in very temperate weather. But\r\nafter that the north wind blew so bitterly that a great frost ensued,\r\nwherewith the whole sea was all frozen up, not only superficially upon\r\nthe upper part, but in depth also the depth of four hundred fathoms,\r\nso that we were fain to forsake our ship and run upon the ice. The\r\nwind sitting long in this corner, and we not able to endure it, put\r\nthis device in practice, which was the invention of Scintharus:--with\r\nmattocks and other instruments we made a mighty cave in the water,\r\nwherein we sheltered ourselves forty days together: in it we kindled\r\nfire, and fed upon fish, of which we found great plenty in our digging.\r\nAt the last, our provision falling short, we returned to our frozen\r\nship, which we set upright, and spreading her sails, went forward as\r\nwell as if we had been upon water, leisurely and gently sliding upon\r\nthe ice; but on the fifth day the weather grew warm, and the frost\r\nbrake, and all was turned to water again. We had not sailed three\r\nhundred furlongs forwards but we came to a little island that was\r\ndesert, where we only took in fresh water (which now began to fail\r\nus), and with our shot killed two wild bulls, and so departed. These\r\nbulls have their horns growing not upon their heads but under their\r\neyes, as Momus thought it better. Then we entered into a sea, not of\r\nwater but of milk, in which appeared a white island full of vines. This\r\nisland was only a great cheese well pressed (as we afterwards found\r\nwhen we fed upon it), about some five-and-twenty furlongs in bigness:\r\nthe vines were full of clusters of grapes, out of which we could crush\r\nno wine, but only milk: in the midst of the island there was a temple\r\nbuilt dedicated to Galatea, one of the daughters of Nereus, as by the\r\ninscription appeared. As long as we remained there the soil yielded\r\nus food and victuals, and our drink was the milk that came out of\r\nthe grapes: in these, as they said, reigneth Tyro, the daughter of\r\nSalmoneus, who, after her departure, received this guerdon at the hands\r\nof Neptune.\r\n\r\nIn this island we rested ourselves five days, and on the sixth put\r\nto sea again, a gentle gale attending us, and the seas all still and\r\nquiet. The eighth day, as we sailed onward, not in milk any longer, but\r\nin salt and azure water, we saw many men running upon the sea, like\r\nunto us every way forth, both in shape and stature, but only for their\r\nfeet, which were of cork, whereupon, I suppose, they had the name of\r\nPhellopodes.\r\n\r\nWe marvelled much when we saw they did not sink, but keep above water,\r\nand travel upon it so boldly. These came unto us, and saluted us in\r\nthe Grecian language, and said they were bound towards Phello, their\r\nown country, and for a while ran along by us, but at last turned their\r\nown way and left us, wishing us a happy and prosperous voyage. Within\r\na while after many islands appeared, and near unto them, upon our\r\nleft hand, stood Phello, the place whereunto they were travelling,\r\nwhich was a city seated upon a mighty great and round cork. Further\r\noff, and more towards the right hand, we saw five other islands,\r\nlarge and mountainous, in which much fire was burning; but directly\r\nbefore us was a spacious flat island, distant from us not above five\r\nhundred furlongs: and approaching somewhat near unto it, a wonderful\r\nfragrant air breathed upon us, of a most sweet and delicate smell,\r\nsuch as Herodotus, the story-writer, saith ariseth out of Arabia the\r\nhappy, consisting of a mixture of roses, daffodils, gillyflowers,\r\nlilies, violets, myrtles, bays, and blossoms of vines: such a dainty\r\nodoriferous savour was conveyed unto us.\r\n\r\nBeing delighted with this smell, and hoping for better fortunes after\r\nour long labours, we got within a little of the isle, in which we found\r\nmany havens on every side, not subject to overflowing, and yet of great\r\ncapacity, and rivers of clear water emptying themselves easily into\r\nthe sea, with meadows and herbs and musical birds, some singing upon\r\nthe shore, and many upon the branches of trees, a still and gentle air\r\ncompassing the whole country. When pleasant blasts gently stirred\r\nthe woods the motion of the branches made a continual delightsome\r\nmelody, like the sound of wind instruments in a solitary place: a\r\nkind of clamour also was heard mixed with it, yet not tumultuous nor\r\noffensive, but like the noise of a banquet, when some do play on wind\r\ninstruments, some commend the music, and some with their hands applaud\r\nthe pipe, or the harp. All which yielded us so great content that we\r\nboldly entered the haven, made fast our ship and landed, leaving in her\r\nonly Scintharus and two more of our companions behind us. Passing along\r\nthrough a sweet meadow we met with the guards that used to sail about\r\nthe island, who took us and bound us with garlands of roses (which are\r\nthe strictest bands they have), to be carried to their governor: from\r\nthem we heard, as we were upon the way, that it was the island of those\r\nthat are called blessed, and that Rhadamanthus was governor there, to\r\nwhom we were brought and placed the fourth in order of them that were\r\nto be judged.\r\n\r\nThe first trial was about Ajax, the son of Telamon, whether he were\r\na meet man to be admitted into the society of the Heroes or not: the\r\nobjections against him were his madness and the killing of himself: and\r\nafter long pleading to and fro, Rhadamanthus gave this sentence, that\r\nfor the present he should be put to Hippocrates, the physician of Cos,\r\nto be purged with helleborus, and upon the recovery of his wits to have\r\nadmittance.\r\n\r\nThe second was a controversy of love, Theseus and Menelaus contending\r\nwhich had the better right to Helen; but Rhadamanthus gave\r\njudgment on Menelaus' side, in respect of the manifold labours and\r\nperils he had incurred for that marriage' sake, whereas Theseus had\r\nwives enough beside to live withal--as the Amazon, and the daughters of\r\nMinos. The third was a question of precedency between Alexander, the\r\nson of Philip, and Hannibal, the Carthaginian, in which Alexander was\r\npreferred, and his throne placed next to the elder Cyrus the Persian.\r\n\r\nIn the fourth place we appeared, and he demanded of us what reason we\r\nhad, being living men, to take land in that sacred country, and we told\r\nhim all our adventures in order as they befell us: then he commanded\r\nus to stand aside, and considering upon it a great while, in the end\r\nproposed it to the benchers, which were many, and among them Aristides\r\nthe Athenian, surnamed the Just: and when he was provided what sentence\r\nto deliver, he said that for our busy curiosity and needless travels we\r\nshould be accountable after our death; but for the present we should\r\nhave a time limited for our abode, during which we should feast with\r\nthe Heroes and then depart, prefixing us seven months' liberty to\r\nconclude our tarriance, and no more. Then our garlands fell off from\r\nus of themselves, and we were set loose and led into the city to feast\r\nwith the blessed.\r\n\r\nThe city was all of gold, compassed with a wall made of the precious\r\nstone smaragdus, which had seven gates, every one cut out of a whole\r\npiece of timber of cinnamon-tree: the pavement of the city and all\r\nthe ground within the walls was ivory: the temples of all the gods\r\nare built of beryl, with large altars made all of one whole amethyst,\r\nupon which they offer their sacrifices: about the city runneth a river\r\nof most excellent sweet ointment, in breadth an hundred cubits of the\r\nlarger measure, and so deep that a man may swim in it with ease. For\r\ntheir baths they have great houses of glass, which they warm with\r\ncinnamon: and their bathing-tubs are filled with warm dew instead of\r\nwater. Their only garments are cobwebs of purple colour; neither have\r\nthey any bodies, but are intactile and without flesh, a mere shape and\r\npresentation only: and being thus bodiless, they yet stand, and are\r\nmoved, are intelligent, and can speak: and their naked soul seemeth to\r\nwander up and down in a corporal likeness: for if a man touch them not\r\nhe cannot say otherwise, but that they have bodies, altogether like\r\nshadows standing upright, and not, as they are, of a dark colour. No\r\nman waxeth any older there than he was before, but of what age he comes\r\nthither, so he continues. Neither is there any night with them, nor\r\nindeed clear day: but like the twilight towards morning before the sun\r\nbe up, such a kind of light do they live in. They know but one season\r\nof the year which is the spring, and feel no other wind but Zephyrus.\r\nThe region flourisheth with all sorts of flowers, and with all pleasing\r\nplants fit for shade: their vines bear fruit twelve times a year, every\r\nmonth once: their pomegranate-trees, their apple-trees, and their\r\nother fruit, they say, bear thirteen times in the year, for in the\r\nmonth called Minous they bear twice. Instead of wheat their ears bear\r\nthem loaves of bread ready baked, like unto mushrooms. About the city\r\nare three hundred three-score and five wells of water, and as many of\r\nhoney, and five hundred of sweet ointment, for they are less than the\r\nother. They have seven rivers of milk and eight of wine.\r\n\r\nThey keep their feast without the city in a field called Elysium,\r\nwhich is a most pleasant meadow, environed with woods of all sorts,\r\nso thick that they serve for a shade to all that are invited, who sit\r\nupon beds of flowers, and are waited upon, and have everything brought\r\nunto them by the winds, unless it be to have the wine filled: and that\r\nthere is no need of: for about the banqueting place are mighty great\r\ntrees growing of clear and pure glass, and the fruit of those trees are\r\ndrinking-cups and other kind of vessels of what fashion or greatness\r\nyou will: and every man that comes to the feast gathers one or two\r\nof those cups, and sets them before him, which will be full of wine\r\npresently, and then they drink. Instead of garlands the nightingales\r\nand other musical birds gather flowers with their beaks out of the\r\nmeadows adjoining, and flying over their heads with chirping notes\r\nscatter them among them.\r\n\r\nThey are anointed with sweet ointment in this manner: sundry clouds\r\ndraw that unguent out of the fountains and the rivers, which settling\r\nover the heads of them that are at the banquet, the least blast of\r\nwind makes a small rain fall upon them like unto a dew. After supper\r\nthey spend the time in music and singing: their ditties that are in\r\nmost request they take out of Homer's verses, who is there present\r\nhimself and feasteth among them, sitting next above Ulysses: their\r\nchoirs consist of boys and virgins, which were directed and assisted\r\nby Eunomus the Locrian, and Arion the Lesbian, and Anacreon, and\r\nStesichorus, who hath had a place there ever since his reconcilement\r\nwith Helena. As soon as these have done there enter a second choir of\r\nswans, swallows, and nightingales; and when they have ended, the whole\r\nwoods ring like wind-instruments by the stirring of the air.\r\n\r\nBut that which maketh most for their mirth are two wells adjoining to\r\nthe banqueting place, the one of laughter, the other of pleasure: of\r\nthese every man drinks to begin the feast withal, which makes them\r\nspend the whole time in mirth and laughter.\r\n\r\nI will also relate unto you what famous men I saw in that association.\r\nThere were all the demigods, and all that fought against Troy,\r\nexcepting Ajax the Locrian: he only, they told me, was tormented in\r\nthe region of the unrighteous. Of barbarians there was the elder and\r\nthe younger Cyrus, and Anacharsis the Scythian, Zamolxis the Thracian,\r\nand Numa the Italian. There was also Lycurgus the Lacedæmonian, and\r\nPhocion and Tellus the Athenians, and all the Wise Men, unless it were\r\nPeriander.\r\n\r\nI also saw Socrates, the son of Sophroniscus, prattling with Nestor\r\nand Palamedes, and close by him stood Hyacinthus the Lacedæmonian, and\r\nthe gallant Narcissus and Hylas, and other beautiful and lovely youths,\r\nand for aught I could gather by him he was far in love with Hyacinthus,\r\nfor he discoursed with him more than all the rest: for which cause,\r\nthey said, Rhadamanthus was offended at him, and often threatened to\r\nthrust him out of the island if he continued to play the fool in that\r\nfashion, and not give over his idle manner of jesting, when he was at\r\ntheir banquet. Only Plato was not present, for they said he dwelled in\r\na city framed by himself, observing the same rule of government and\r\nlaws as he had prescribed for them to live under.\r\n\r\nAristippus and Epicurus are prime men amongst them, because they\r\nare the most jovial good fellows and the best companions. Diogenes\r\nthe Sinopean was so far altered from the man he was before that he\r\nmarried with Lais the harlot, and was many times so drunk that he would\r\nrise and dance about the room as a man out of his senses. Æsop the\r\nPhrygian served them for a jester. There was not one Stoic in company\r\nbut were still busied in ascending the height of virtue's hill: and\r\nof Chrysippus we heard that it was not lawful for him by any means to\r\ntouch upon the island until he have the fourth time purged himself\r\nwith helleborus. The Academics, they say, were willing enough to come,\r\nbut that they yet are doubtful and in suspense, and cannot comprehend\r\nhow there should be any such island; but indeed, I think, they were\r\nfearful to come to be judged by Rhadamanthus, because themselves have\r\nabolished all kind of judgment: yet many of them, they say, had a\r\ndesire, and would follow after those that were coming hither, but were\r\nso slothful as to give it over because they were not comprehensive, and\r\ntherefore turned back in the midst of their way.\r\n\r\nThese were all the men of note that I saw there; and amongst them all\r\nAchilles was held to be the best man, and next to him Theseus. For\r\ntheir manner of venery and copulation thus it is: they couple openly\r\nin the eyes of all men, both with females and male kind, and no man\r\nholds it for any dishonesty. Only Socrates would swear deeply that he\r\naccompanied young men in a cleanly fashion, and therefore every man\r\ncondemned him for a perjured fellow: and Hyacinthus and Narcissus both\r\nconfessed otherwise for all his denial.\r\n\r\nThe women there are all in common, and no man takes exception at it,\r\nin which respect they are absolutely the best Platonists in the world:\r\nand so do the boys yield themselves to any man's pleasure without\r\ncontradiction.\r\n\r\nAfter I had spent two or three days in this manner, I went to talk with\r\nHomer the poet, our leisure serving us both well, and to know of him\r\nwhat countryman he was, a question with us hard to be resolved, and he\r\nsaid he could not certainly tell himself, because some said he was of\r\nChios, some of Smyrna, and many to be of Colophon; but he said indeed\r\nhe was a Babylonian, and among his own countrymen not called Homer but\r\nTigranes, and afterwards living as an hostage among the Grecians, he\r\nhad therefore that name put upon him. Then I questioned him about those\r\nverses in his books that are disallowed as not of his making, whether\r\nthey were written by him or not, and he told me they were all his own,\r\nmuch condemning Zenodotus and Aristarchus, the grammarians, for their\r\nweakness in judgment.\r\n\r\nWhen he had satisfied me in this, I asked him again why he began the\r\nfirst verse of his poem with anger: and he told me it fell out so by\r\nchance, not upon any premeditation. I also desired to know of him\r\nwhether he wrote his Odysseys before his Iliads, as many men do hold:\r\nbut he said it was not so. As for his blindness which is charged upon\r\nhim, I soon found it was far otherwise, and perceived it so plainly\r\nthat I needed not to question him about it.\r\n\r\nThus was I used to do many days when I found him idle, and would go\r\nto him and ask him many questions, which he would give me answer to\r\nvery freely: especially when we talked of a trial he had in the court\r\nof justice, wherein he got the better: for Thersites had preferred a\r\nbill of complaint against him for abusing him and scoffing at him in\r\nhis Poem, in which action Homer was acquitted, having Ulysses for his\r\nadvocate.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time came to us Pythagoras the Samian, who had\r\nchanged his shape now seven times, and lived in as many lives, and\r\naccomplished the periods of his soul. The right half of his body was\r\nwholly of gold; and they all agreed that he should have place amongst\r\nthem, but were doubtful what to call him, Pythagoras or Euphorbus.\r\nEmpedocles also came to the place, scorched quite over, as if his body\r\nhad been broiled upon the embers; but could not be admitted for all his\r\ngreat entreaty.\r\n\r\nThe time passing thus along, the day of prizes for masteries of\r\nactivity now approached, which they call Thanatusia. The setters of\r\nthem forth were Achilles the fifth time, and Theseus the seventh time.\r\nTo relate the whole circumstance would require a long discourse, but\r\nthe principal points I will deliver. At wrestling Carus, one of the\r\nlineage of Hercules, had the best, and wan the garland from Ulysses.\r\nThe fight with fists was equal between Arius the Ægyptian, who was\r\nburied at Corinth, and Epius, that combated for it. There was no prize\r\nappointed for the Pancratian fight: neither do I remember who got the\r\nbest in running: but for poetry, though Homer without question were too\r\ngood for them all, yet the best was given to Hesiodus. The prizes were\r\nall alike, garlands plotted of peacocks' feathers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAs soon as the games were ended, news came to us that the damned crew\r\nin the habitation of the wicked had broken their bounds, escaped the\r\ngaolers, and were coming to assail the island, led by Phalaris the\r\nAgrigentine, Busyris the Ægyptian, Diomedes the Thracian, Sciron,\r\nPituocamptes, and others: which Rhadamanthus hearing, he ranged\r\nthe Heroes in battle array upon the sea-shore, under the leading of\r\nTheseus and Achilles and Ajax Telamonius, who had now recovered his\r\nsenses, where they joined fight; but the Heroes had the day, Achilles\r\ncarrying himself very nobly. Socrates also, who was placed in the right\r\nwing, was noted for a brave soldier, much better than he was in his\r\nlifetime, in the battle at Delium: for when the enemy charged him, he\r\nneither fled nor changed countenance: wherefore afterwards, in reward\r\nof his valour, he had a prize set out for him on purpose, which was\r\na beautiful and spacious garden, planted in the suburbs of the city,\r\nwhereunto he invited many, and disputed with them there, giving it the\r\nname of Necracademia.\r\n\r\nThen we took the vanquished prisoners, and bound them, and sent them\r\nback to be punished with greater torments.\r\n\r\nThis fight was also penned by Homer, who, at my departure, gave me the\r\nbook to show my friends, which I afterwards lost and many things else\r\nbeside: but the first verse of the poem I remember was this: \"Tell me\r\nnow, Muse, how the dead Heroes fought.\"\r\n\r\nWhen they overcome in fight, they have a custom to make a feast with\r\nsodden beans, wherewith they banquet together for joy of their victory:\r\nonly Pythagoras had no part with them, but sat aloof off, and lost his\r\ndinner because he could not away with beans.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSix months were now passed over, and the seventh halfway onwards,\r\nwhen a new business was begot amongst us. For Cinyras the son of\r\nScintharus, a proper tall young man, had long been in love with Helena,\r\nand it might plainly be perceived that she as fondly doted upon him,\r\nfor they would still be winking and drinking one to another whilst they\r\nwere a-feasting, and rise alone together, and wander up and down in\r\nthe wood. This humour increasing, and knowing not what course to take,\r\nCinyras' device was to steal away Helena, whom he found as pliable\r\nto run away with him, to some of the islands adjoining, either to\r\nPhello, or Tyroessa, having before combined with three of the boldest\r\nfellows in my company to join with them in their conspiracy; but never\r\nacquainted his father with it, knowing that he would surely punish him\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\nBeing resolved upon this, they watched their time to put it in\r\npractice: for when night was come, and I absent (for I was fallen\r\nasleep at the feast), they gave a slip to all the rest, and went away\r\nwith Helena to shipboard as fast as they could. Menelaus waking about\r\nmidnight, and finding his bed empty, and his wife gone, made an outcry,\r\nand calling up his brother, went to the court of Rhadamanthus.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the day appeared, the scouts told them they had descried\r\na ship, which by that time was got far off into the sea. Then\r\nRhadamanthus set out a vessel made of one whole piece of timber of\r\nasphodelus wood, manned with fifty of the Heroes to pursue after them,\r\nwhich were so willing on their way, that by noon they had overtaken\r\nthem newly entered into the milky ocean, not far from Tyroessa, so near\r\nwere they got to make an escape. Then took we their ship and hauled it\r\nafter us with a chain of roses and brought it back again.\r\n\r\nRhadamanthus first examined Cinyras and his companions whether they\r\nhad any other partners in this plot, and they confessing none, were\r\nadjudged to be tied fast by the privy members and sent into the place\r\nof the wicked, there to be tormented, after they had been scourged with\r\nrods made of mallows. Helena, all blubbered with tears, was so ashamed\r\nof herself that she would not show her face. They also decreed to\r\nsend us packing out of the country, our prefixed time being come, and\r\nthat we should stay there no longer than the next morrow: wherewith\r\nI was much aggrieved and wept bitterly to leave so good a place and\r\nturn wanderer again I knew not whither: but they comforted me much\r\nin telling me that before many years were past I should be with them\r\nagain, and showed me a chair and a bed prepared for me against the time\r\nto come near unto persons of the best quality.\r\n\r\nThen went I to Rhadamanthus, humbly beseeching him to tell me my future\r\nfortunes, and to direct me in my course; and he told me that after\r\nmany travels and dangers, I should at last recover my country, but\r\nwould not tell me the certain time of my return: and showing me the\r\nislands adjoining, which were five in number, and a sixth a little\r\nfurther off, he said, Those nearest are the islands of the ungodly,\r\nwhich you see burning all in a light fire, but the other sixth is the\r\nisland of dreams, and beyond that is the island of Calypso, which you\r\ncannot see from hence. When you are past these, you shall come into the\r\ngreat continent, over against your own country, where you shall suffer\r\nmany afflictions, and pass through many nations, and meet with men of\r\ninhuman conditions, and at length attain to the other continent.\r\n\r\nWhen he had told me this, he plucked a root of mallows out of the\r\nground, and reached it to me, commanding me in my greatest perils to\r\nmake my prayers to that: advising me further neither to rake in the\r\nfire with my knife, nor to feed upon lupins, nor to come near a boy\r\nwhen he is past eighteen years of age: if I were mindful of this, the\r\nhopes would be great that I should come to the island again.\r\n\r\nThen we prepared for our passage, and feasted with them at the usual\r\nhour, and next morrow I went to Homer, entreating him to do so much as\r\nmake an epigram of two verses for me, which he did: and I erected a\r\npillar of berylstone near unto the haven, and engraved them upon it.\r\nThe epigram was this:\r\n\r\n    Lucian, the gods' belov'd, did once attain\r\n    To see all this, and then go home again.\r\n\r\nAfter that day's tarrying, we put to sea, brought onward on our way by\r\nthe Heroes, where Ulysses closely coming to me that Penelope might not\r\nsee him, conveyed a letter into my hand to deliver to Calypso in the\r\nisle of Ogygia. Rhadamanthus also sent Nauplius, the ferryman, along\r\nwith us, that if it were our fortune to put into those islands, no man\r\nshould lay hands upon us, because we were bent upon other employments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNo sooner had we passed beyond the smell of that sweet odour but\r\nwe felt a horrible filthy stink, like pitch and brimstone burning,\r\ncarrying an intolerable scent with it as if men were broiling upon\r\nburning coals: the air was dark and muddy, from which distilled a\r\npitchy kind of dew. We heard also the lash of the whips, and the\r\nroarings of the tormented: yet went we not to visit all the islands,\r\nbut that wherein we landed was of this form: it was wholly compassed\r\nabout with steep, sharp, and craggy rocks, without either wood or\r\nwater: yet we made a shift to scramble up among the cliffs, and so went\r\nforwards in a way quite overgrown with briars and thorns through a\r\nmost villainous ghastly country, and coming at last to the prison and\r\nplace of torment we wondered to see the nature and quality of the soil,\r\nwhich brought forth no other flowers but swords and daggers, and round\r\nabout it ran certain rivers, the first of dirt, the second of blood,\r\nand the innermost of burning fire, which was very broad and unpassable,\r\nfloating like water, and working like the waves of the sea, full of\r\nsundry fishes, some as big as firebrands, others of a less size like\r\ncoals of fire, and these they call Lychniscies.\r\n\r\nThere was but one narrow entrance into it, and Timon of Athens\r\nappointed to keep the door, yet we got in by the help of Nauplius, and\r\nsaw them that were tormented, both kings and private persons very many,\r\nof which there were some that I knew, for there I saw Cinyras tied by\r\nprivate members, and hanging up in the smoke. But the greatest torments\r\nof all are inflicted upon them that told any lies in their lifetime,\r\nand wrote untruly, as Ctesias the Cnidian, Herodotus, and many other,\r\nwhich I beholding, was put in great hopes that I should never have\r\nanything to do there, for I do not know that ever I spake any untruth\r\nin my life. We therefore returned speedily to our ship (for we could\r\nendure the sight no longer), and taking our leaves of Nauplius, sent\r\nhim back again.\r\n\r\nA little after appeared the Isle of Dreams near unto us, an obscure\r\ncountry and unperspicuous to the eye, endued with the same quality as\r\ndreams themselves are: for as we drew, it still gave back and fled from\r\nus, that it seemed to be farther off than at the first, but in the end\r\nwe attained it and entered the haven called Hypnus, and adjoined to\r\nthe gate of ivory, where the temple of Alectryon stands, and took land\r\nsomewhat late in the evening.\r\n\r\nEntering the gate we saw many dreams of sundry fashions; but I will\r\nfirst tell you somewhat of the city, because no man else hath written\r\nany description of it: only Homer hath touched it a little, but to\r\nsmall purpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt is round about environed with a wood, the trees whereof are\r\nexceeding high poppies and mandragoras, in which an infinite number of\r\nowls do nestle, and no other birds to be seen in the island: near unto\r\nit is a river running, called by them Nyctiporus, and at the gates are\r\ntwo wells, the one named Negretus, the other Pannychia. The wall of\r\nthe city is high and of a changeable colour, like unto the rainbow,\r\nin which are four gates, though Homer speak but of two: for there are\r\ntwo which look toward the fields of sloth, the one made of iron, the\r\nother of potter's clay, through which those dreams have passage that\r\nrepresent fearful, bloody, and cruel matters: the other two behold the\r\nhaven and the sea, of which the one is made of horn, the other of\r\nivory, which we went in at.\r\n\r\nAs we entered the city, on the right hand stands the temple of the\r\nNight, whom, with Alectryon, they reverence above all the gods: for\r\nhe hath also a temple built for him near unto the haven. On the left\r\nhand stands the palace of sleep, for he is the sovereign king over them\r\nall, and hath deputed two great princes to govern under him, namely,\r\nTaraxion, the son of Matogenes, and Plutocles, the son of Phantasion.\r\n\r\nIn the middest of the market-place is a well, by them called Careotis,\r\nand two temples adjoining, the one of falsehood, the other of truth,\r\nwhich have either of them a private cell peculiar to the priests, and\r\nan oracle, in which the chief prophet is Antiphon, the interpreter of\r\ndreams, who was preferred by Sleep to that place of dignity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThese dreams are not all alike either in nature or shape, for some of\r\nthem are long, beautiful, and pleasing: others again are as short and\r\ndeformed. Some make show to be of gold, and others to be as base and\r\nbeggarly. Some of them had wings, and were of monstrous forms: others\r\nset out in pomp, as it were in a triumph, representing the appearances\r\nof kings, gods, and other persons.\r\n\r\nMany of them were of our acquaintance, for they had been seen of us\r\nbefore, which came unto us and saluted us as their old friends, and\r\ntook us and lulled us asleep, and feasted us nobly and courteously,\r\npromising beside all other entertainment which was sumptuous and\r\ncostly, to make us kings and princes. Some of them brought us home to\r\nour own country to show us our friends there, and come back with us the\r\nnext morrow.\r\n\r\nThus we spent thirty days and as many nights among them, sleeping and\r\nfeasting all the while, until a sudden clap of thunder awakened us all,\r\nand we starting up, provided ourselves of victuals, and took sea again,\r\nand on the third day landed in Ogygia. But upon the way I opened the\r\nletter I was to deliver, and read the contents, which were these:\r\n\r\n\"Ulysses to Calypso sendeth greeting. This is to give you to understand\r\nthat after my departure from you in the vessel I made in haste for\r\nmyself, I suffered shipwreck, and hardly escaped by the help of\r\nLeucothea into the country of the Phæacks, who sent me to mine own\r\nhome, where I found many that were wooers to my wife, and riotously\r\nconsumed my means; but I slew them all, and was afterwards killed\r\nmyself by my son Telegonus, whom I begat of Circe, and am now in the\r\nisland of the blessed, where I daily repent myself for refusing to live\r\nwith you, and forsaking the immortality proffered me by you; but if I\r\ncan spy a convenient time, I will give them all the slip and come to\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the effect of the letter, with some addition concerning us,\r\nthat we should have entertainment: and far had I not gone from the sea\r\nbut I found such a cave as Homer speaks of, and she herself working\r\nbusily at her wool. When she had received the letter, and brought us\r\nin, she began to weep and take on grievously, but afterwards she called\r\nus to meat, and made us very good cheer, asking us many questions\r\nconcerning Ulysses and Penelope, whether she was so beautiful and\r\nmodest as Ulysses had often before bragged of her.\r\n\r\nAnd we made her such answer as we thought would give her best content:\r\nand departing to our ship, reposed ourselves near unto the shore, and\r\nin the morning put to sea, where we were taken with a violent storm,\r\nwhich tossed us two days together, and on the third we fell among the\r\nColocynthopiratans. These are a wild kind of men, that issue out of\r\nthe islands adjoining, and prey upon passengers, and for their shipping\r\nhave mighty great gourds six cubits in length, which they make hollow\r\nwhen they are ripe, and cleanse out all that is within them, and use\r\nthe rinds for ships, making their masts of reeds, and their sails of\r\nthe gourd leaves.\r\n\r\nThese set upon us with two ships furnished and fought with us, and\r\nwounded many, casting at us instead of stones the seeds of those\r\ngourds. The fight was continued with equal fortune until about noon, at\r\nwhich time, behind the Colocynthopiratans, we espied the Caryonautans\r\ncoming on, who, as it appeared, were enemies to the other, for when\r\nthey saw them approach, they forsook us and turned about to fight\r\nwith them; and in the mean space we hoist sail and away, leaving\r\nthem together by the ears, and no doubt but the Caryonautans had the\r\nbetter of the day, for they exceeded in number, having five ships well\r\nfurnished, and their vessels of greater strength, for they are made\r\nof nutshells cloven in the midst and cleansed, of which every half is\r\nfifteen fathom in length.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhen we were got out of sight we were careful for the curing of our\r\nhurt men, and from that time forwards went no more unarmed, fearing\r\ncontinually to be assaulted on the sudden: and good cause we had: for\r\nbefore sun-setting some twenty men or thereabouts, which also were\r\npirates, made towards us, riding upon monstrous great dolphins, which\r\ncarried them surely: and when their riders gat upon their backs,\r\nwould neigh like horses. When they were come near us, they divided\r\nthemselves, some on the one side, and some on the other, and flung at\r\nus with dried cuttle-fishes and the eyes of sea-crabs: but when we shot\r\nat them again and hurt them, they would not abide it, but fled to the\r\nisland, the most of them wounded.\r\n\r\nAbout midnight, the sea being calm, we fell before we were aware upon\r\na mighty great halcyon's nest, in compass no less than threescore\r\nfurlongs, in which the halcyon herself sailed, as she was hatching her\r\neggs, in quantity almost equalling the nest, for when she took her\r\nwings, the blast of her feathers had like to have overturned our ship,\r\nmaking a lamentable noise as she flew along.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was day, we got upon it, and found it to be a nest,\r\nfashioned like a great lighter, with trees plaited and wound one within\r\nanother, in which were five hundred eggs, every one bigger than a tun\r\nof Chios measure, and so near their time of hatching that the young\r\nchickens might be seen and began to cry. Then with an axe we hewed one\r\nof the eggs in pieces, and cut out a young one that had no feathers,\r\nwhich yet was bigger than twenty of our vultures.\r\n\r\nWhen we had gone some two hundred furlongs from this nest, fearful\r\nprodigies and strange tokens appeared unto us, for the carved goose,\r\nthat stood for an ornament on the stern of our ship, suddenly flushed\r\nout with feathers and began to cry. Scintharus, our pilot, that was\r\na bald man, in an instant was covered with hair: and which was more\r\nstrange than all the rest, the mast of our ship began to bud out with\r\nbranches and to bear fruit at the top, both of figs and great clusters\r\nof grapes, but not yet ripe. Upon the sight of this we had great cause\r\nto be troubled in mind, and therefore besought the gods to avert from\r\nus the evil that by these tokens was portended.\r\n\r\nAnd we had not passed full out five hundred furlongs, but we came in\r\nview of a mighty wood of pine-trees and cypress, which made us think\r\nit had been land, when it was indeed a sea of infinite depth, planted\r\nwith trees that had no roots, but floated firm and upright, standing\r\nupon the water. When we came to it and found how the case stood with\r\nus, we knew not what to do with ourselves. To go forwards through the\r\ntrees was altogether impossible: they were so thick and grew so close\r\ntogether: and to turn again with safety was as much unlikely.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nI therefore got me up to the top of the highest tree to discover,\r\nif I could, what was beyond; and I found the breadth of the wood to\r\nbe fifty furlongs or thereabout, and then appeared another ocean to\r\nreceive us. Wherefore we thought it best to assay to lift up our ship\r\nupon the leaves of the trees which were thick grown, and by that means\r\npass over, if it were possible, to the other ocean: and so we did: for\r\nfastening a strong cable to our ship, we wound it about the tops of the\r\ntrees, and with much ado poised it up to the height, and placing it\r\nupon the branches, spread our sails, and were carried as it were upon\r\nthe sea, dragging our ship after us by the help of the wind which set\r\nit forwards. At which time a verse of the poet Antimachus came to my\r\nremembrance, wherein he speaks of sailing over tops of trees.\r\n\r\nWhen we had passed over the wood, and were come to the sea again, we\r\nlet down our ship in the same manner as we took it up. Then sailed we\r\nforwards in a pure and clear stream, until we came to an exceeding\r\ngreat gulf or trench in the sea, made by the division of the waters as\r\nmany times is upon land, where we see great clefts made in the ground\r\nby earthquakes and other means. Whereupon we struck sail and our ship\r\nstayed upon a sudden when it was at the pit's brim ready to tumble\r\nin: and we stooping down to look into it, thought it could be no less\r\nthan a thousand furlongs deep, most fearful and monstrous to behold,\r\nfor the water stood as it were divided into two parts, but looking on\r\nour right hand afar off, we perceived a bridge of water, which to our\r\nseeming, did join the two seas together and crossed over from the one\r\nto the other. Wherefore we laboured with oars to get unto it, and over\r\nit we went and with much ado got to the further side beyond all our\r\nexpectation.\r\n\r\nThen a calm sea received us, and in it we found an island, not very\r\ngreat, but inhabited with unsociable people, for in it were dwelling\r\nwild men named Bucephalians, that had horns on their heads like the\r\npicture of Minotaurus, where we went ashore to look for fresh water and\r\nvictuals, for ours was all spent: and there we found water enough, but\r\nnothing else appeared; only we heard a great bellowing and roaring a\r\nlittle way off, which we thought to have been some herd of cattle, and\r\ngoing forwards, fell upon those men, who espying us, chased us back\r\nagain, and took three of our company: the rest fled towards the sea.\r\n\r\nThen we all armed ourselves, not meaning to leave our friends\r\nunrevenged, and set upon the Bucephalians as they were dividing the\r\nflesh of them that were slain, and put them all to flight, and pursued\r\nafter them, of whom we killed fifty, and two we took alive, and so\r\nreturned with our prisoners; but food we could find none.\r\n\r\nThen the company were all earnest with me to kill those whom we had\r\ntaken; but I did not like so well of that, thinking it better to keep\r\nthem in bonds until ambassadors should come from the Bucephalians to\r\nransom them that were taken, and indeed they did: and I well understood\r\nby the nodding of their heads, and their lamentable lowing, like\r\npetitioners, what their business was.\r\n\r\nSo we agreed upon a ransom of sundry cheeses and dried fish and onions\r\nand four deer with three legs apiece, two behind and one before. Upon\r\nthese conditions we delivered those whom we had taken, and tarrying\r\nthere but one day, departed.\r\n\r\nThen the fishes began to show themselves in the sea, and the birds\r\nflew over our heads, and all other tokens of our approach to land\r\nappeared unto us. Within a while after we saw men travelling the seas,\r\nand a new found manner of navigation, themselves supplying the office\r\nboth for ship and sailor, and I will tell you how. As they lie upon\r\ntheir backs in the water and their privy members standing upright,\r\nwhich are of a large size and fit for such a purpose, they fasten\r\nthereto a sail, and holding their cords in their hands, when the wind\r\nhath taken it, are carried up and down as please themselves.\r\n\r\nAfter these followed others riding upon cork, for they yoke two\r\ndolphins together, and drive them on (performing themselves the place\r\nof a coachman), which draw the cork along after them. These never\r\noffered us any violence, nor once shunned our sight; but passed along\r\nin our company without fear, in a peaceable manner, wondering at the\r\ngreatness of our ship, and beholding it on every side.\r\n\r\nAt evening we arrived upon a small island, inhabited, as it seemed,\r\nonly by women, which could speak the Greek language; for they came unto\r\nus, gave us their hands, and saluted us, all attired like wantons,\r\nbeautiful and young, wearing long mantles down to the foot: the island\r\nwas called Cabbalusa and the city Hydramardia. So the women received\r\nus, and every one of them took aside one of us for herself, and made\r\nhim her guest. But I pausing a little upon it (for my heart misgave\r\nme), looked narrowly round about, and saw the bones of many men, and\r\nthe skulls lying together in a corner; yet I thought not good to make\r\nany stir, or to call my company about me, or to put on arms; but taking\r\nthe mallow into my hand, made my earnest prayers thereto that I might\r\nescape out of those present perils.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWithin a while after, when the strange female came to wait upon me, I\r\nperceived she had not the legs of a woman, but the hoofs of an ass.\r\nWhereupon I drew my sword, and taking fast hold of her, bound her, and\r\nexamined her upon the point: and she, though unwillingly, confessed\r\nthat they were sea-women, called Onosceleans, and they fed upon\r\nstrangers that travelled that way. For, said she, when we have made\r\nthem drunk, we go to bed to them, and in their sleep, make a hand of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nI hearing this, left her bound in the place where she was, and went up\r\nto the roof of the house, where I made an outcry, and called my company\r\nto me, and when they were come together, acquainted them with all that\r\nI had heard, and showed them the bones, and brought them into her that\r\nwas bound, who suddenly was turned into water, and could not be seen.\r\nNotwithstanding, I thrust my sword into the water to see what would\r\ncome of it, and it was changed into blood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThen we made all the haste we could to our ship, and got us away,\r\nand as soon as it was clear day, we had sight of the mainland, which\r\nwe judged to be the country opposite to our continent. Whereupon we\r\nworshipped, and made our prayers, and took council what was now to be\r\ndone. Some thought it best only to go a-land and so return back again:\r\nothers thought it better to leave our ship there and march into the\r\nmid-land to try what the inhabitants would do: but whilst we were upon\r\nthis consultation a violent storm fell upon us, which drave our ship\r\nagainst the shore, and burst it all in pieces, and with much ado we all\r\nswam to land with our arms, every man catching what he could lay hands\r\non.\r\n\r\nThese are all the occurrences I can acquaint you withal, till the time\r\nof our landing, both in the sea, and in our course to the islands, and\r\nin the air, and after that in the whale; and when we came out again\r\nwhat betid unto us among the Heroes and among the dreams, and lastly\r\namong the Bucephalians and the Onosceleans. What passed upon land the\r\nnext books shall deliver.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Lucian's True History, by Lucian of Samosata",
