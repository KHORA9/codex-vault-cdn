The following are the meanings which this and a few\r\nother words bear in these pages:—\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Explosion._—The sudden and violent generation, with a\r\n  loud noise and in a time inappreciable by the unaided\r\n  senses, of a very great volume of gas, by the combustion\r\n  of a body occupying a comparatively very small volume.\r\n\r\n  _Progressive Combustion._—Combustion which takes place\r\n  in a time appreciable by the unaided senses, such as that\r\n  of rocket composition or a bit of paper.\r\n\r\n  _Gunpowder._—A mixture of saltpetre, charcoal, and\r\n  sulphur, which explodes. The signs of its explosion are a\r\n  bright flash, a loud noise, and a large volume of smoke.\r\n\r\n  _Incendiary_ (for “incendiary composition”).—A substance\r\n  or mixture which burns progressively, although fiercely,\r\n  and is hard to put out.\r\n\r\n  _Machine_ always means an apparatus of the ballista type.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Cannon_ includes bombards, mortars, guns, &c.\r\n\r\n  _Musket_ includes all hand firearms charged with\r\n  gunpowder.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nOf the many difficulties that beset the present inquiry, two deserve\r\nspecial mention.\r\n\r\nThe first is the want of simple exactness in most early writers when\r\nrecording the facts from which we have to draw our conclusions. At\r\ntimes their descriptions are so meagre that it is difficult, if not\r\nimpossible, to decide whether certain projectiles were incendiary or\r\nexplosive. At other times they abound in tropes and figures of speech\r\nwhich amount to an unintentional _suggestio falsi_. “The missiles\r\nspread themselves abroad like a cloud,” says a Spanish Arab; “they\r\nroar like thunder; they flame like a furnace; they reduce everything\r\nto ashes.”[1] A projectile full of blazing Greek fire appeared to\r\nJoinville to be of portentous bulk. It flew through the midnight sky\r\nwith thundering noise like a fiery dragon, followed by a long trail of\r\nflame; and it illumined the whole camp as with the light of day.[2]\r\nEven to approach the truth, we must prune such figures of rhetoric;\r\nand this is a dangerous operation, for we may prune too much. The\r\nonly safeguard against these suggestive metaphors is to keep steadily\r\nin view the distinctive peculiarities of incendiary and explosive\r\nprojectiles.\r\n\r\nThe incendiary shell was simply an envelope intended to convey into\r\nthe interior of a fort, ship, &c., a quantity of combustible matter,\r\nwhich burned with such violence as to _set fire_ to everything\r\ninflammable that was near it. The primary object of the explosive\r\nshell, on the other hand, was to _blow up_ whatever it fell upon. It\r\nmight occasionally, by the intense heat generated by the explosion,[3]\r\nset fire to its surroundings when inflammable; but this was a mere\r\nincidental consequence of its action. Its aim and end was to explode.\r\n\r\nWhen a musket or cannon was fired there was a bright flash, a loud,\r\nmomentary report, and a large volume of smoke.[4] When an incendiary\r\nmissile was discharged from a machine there was no flash, but little\r\nsmoke, and the only sounds were the whizzing and sputtering of the\r\nburning mixture and the creaking and groaning of bolts, spars, ropes,\r\n&c.:—\r\n\r\n  “With grisly soune out goth the greté gonne.”[5]\r\n\r\nAn explosive missile made its way through the air with little noise[6]\r\nand less light:[7] during its flight the blazing contents of the\r\nincendiary shell doubtless gave out much light and made a considerable\r\nnoise, as described by many early writers. When an explosive shell\r\nreached its object there was, sooner or later (if it acted at all),\r\nan explosion, occasionally followed by a conflagration: an incendiary\r\nshell produced a conflagration only.\r\n\r\nThe second difficulty arises from the change of meaning which many\r\ntechnical words have undergone in the lapse of years.\r\n\r\nThe Arabic word _barúd_ originally meant _hail_, was afterwards applied\r\nto _saltpetre_, and finally came to signify _gunpowder_. Our own word\r\n_powder_, which at first meant a fine, floury dust (_pulvis_), is\r\noften used in the present day to designate the stringy nitrocelluloid,\r\n_cordite_—smokeless powder. The Chinese word _yo_ means _gunpowder_\r\nnow, although its first meaning was a _drug_ or _plant_. For centuries\r\ngunpowder was called _kraut_ in Germany, and to this day it is called\r\n_kruid_ in Holland. The Danish _krud_ has not long become obsolete.\r\n\r\nThe present Chinese word for _firearm_, _huo p’áu_, originally meant\r\na _machine_ for throwing blazing incendiary matter. The Arabic word\r\n_bundúq_ at first meant a _hazel-nut_, secondly a _clay-pellet_ the\r\nsize of a hazel-nut, thirdly a _bullet_, and finally a _firearm_.[8]\r\nThe Latin _nochus_, a _hazel-nut_, is used, strange to say, to\r\ndesignate a _smoke-ball_ by an old German military writer, Konrad\r\nKyeser, whose “Bellifortis” dates from 1405.[9] The word was also\r\napplied in Germany to bullets in general, and more particularly to\r\nprojectiles discharged by machines.\r\n\r\nThe word _Artillery_, both in France and England, originally meant\r\n_bows and arrows_. In his original account of the battle of Cressy,\r\nFroissart calls the apparatus and bolts of the Genoese crossbowmen\r\n_leur artillerie_; while a few lines further on he speaks of the\r\n_kanons_ of the English.[10] Ascham, writing in 1571, says: “Artillerie\r\nnowadays is taken for two things: gunnes and bowes.”[11] Selden reminds\r\nus that _gonne_, our present _gun_, at first meant a _machine_ of the\r\nballista type.[12] It is used in this sense in “Kyng Alisaunder,” 3268,\r\nwritten A.D. 1275-1300, and other metrical romances. Like the Arabic\r\n_bundúq_, the word is occasionally applied to the _projectile_, as in\r\nthe “Avowing of Arthur,” st. 65. It is used in the modern sense, as\r\n_cannon_, in the “Vision of Piers the Plowman,” Passus xxi, C text,\r\n293, a poem begun in 1362 and finally revised by its author in 1390;\r\nand in all three meanings by Chaucer, in poems written during the last\r\nquarter of the fourteenth century;—as a machine in the “Romaunt of the\r\nRose,” 4176, as a projectile in the “Legende of Good Women,” 637, and\r\nas a cannon in the “Hous of Fame,” 533.\r\n\r\n“When the thing is perceived, the idea conceived,” says Professor\r\nWhitney, “(men) find in the existing resources of speech the means of\r\nits expression—a name which formerly belonged to something else in\r\nsome way akin to it; a combination of words,” &c.[13] For example, a\r\nword, W, which has always been the name of a thing, M, is applied to\r\nsome new thing, N, which has been devised for the same use as M and\r\nanswers the purpose better.[14] W thus represents both M and N for\r\nan indefinite time,[15] until M eventually drops into disuse and W\r\ncomes to mean N and N only. The confusion necessarily arising from\r\nthe equivocal meaning of W during this indefinite period, is entirely\r\ndue, of course, to neglect of Horace’s advice to coin new names for\r\nnew things.[16] Had a new name been given to N from the first, no\r\ndifficulty could possibly have ensued, and our way would have been\r\nstraight and clear. But as matters have fallen out, not only have we\r\nto determine whether W means M or N, whenever it is used during the\r\ntransition period,[17] but we have to meet the arguments of those,\r\nnever far off, who insist that because W meant N _finally_, it must\r\nhave meant N at some bygone time when history and probability alike\r\nshow that it meant M and M only. Examples, enough and to spare, of such\r\narguments will be met with shortly.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the change of meaning which many military words\r\nhave suffered, no translation of passages in foreign books containing\r\nambiguous words should be relied upon, if access to the originals,\r\nor faithful copies of them, can be obtained. As an example of the\r\nnecessity for this precaution, let us compare a few sentences relating\r\nto the siege of Jerusalem, A.D. 70, from the “Polychronicon” of Higden\r\n(_d._ cir. 1363), Rolls Series, iv. 429 _ff._, with the translations of\r\nthem by Trevisa, 1385, and by the author of MS. Harl. No. 2261, of A.D.\r\n1432-50.\r\n\r\n\r\nA\r\n\r\n  (1) Inde Vespasianus ictu arietis murum conturbat\r\n  (Higden).\r\n\r\n  (2) Thanne Vaspacianus destourbed the wal with the stroke\r\n  of an engyne (Trevisa).\r\n\r\n  (3) Wherefore Vespasian troublede the walle soore with\r\n  gunnes and other engynes (MS. Harl.).\r\n\r\n\r\nB\r\n\r\n  (1) Josephus tamen ardenti oleo superjecto omnia\r\n  machinamenta exussit (Higden).\r\n\r\n  (2) But Joseph threwe out brennynge oyle uppon alle her\r\n  gynnes and smoot all her gynnes (Trevisa).\r\n\r\n  (3) Then Josephus destroyede alle theire instruments in\r\n  castenge brennenge oyle on hit (MS.

Harl.).\r\n\r\nNo suspicion rests upon either of these translators; yet, were the\r\noriginal lost, a covert allusion to cannon might be discovered in\r\nTrevisa’s translation of B and C, and the Harleian translation of A, C,\r\nand D would be put forward as proof positive of their use.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThe claims of the Greeks to the invention of gunpowder are examined in\r\nChap. III. Chap. IV. is an inquiry into the nature and authorship of\r\nthe _Liber Ignium_ of Marcus Græcus. The claims of the Arabs, Hindus,\r\nChinese, and English are considered in Chaps. V.-VIII. In Part II. the\r\nprogress of Ammunition is very briefly traced from the introduction of\r\ncannon to the introduction of breechloading arms.\r\n\r\nAs the book is addressed to the officers of the Army, who seldom have\r\na library at command, the authorities for the statements of important\r\nfacts are generally given at length. On all controversial points,\r\nwhen a foreign authority is quoted the original[18] is given as well\r\nas the translation. I have endeavoured to acknowledge my obligation\r\nin all cases where quotations have been borrowed from others without\r\nverification.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe invention of gunpowder was impossible until the properties of\r\nsaltpetre had become known. We proceed, therefore, in the following\r\nchapter to determine the approximate date of the discovery of this\r\nsalt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nSALTPETRE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe attention of the ancients was naturally attracted by the\r\nefflorescences which form on certain stones, on walls, and in caves\r\nand cellars; and the Hindus and nomad Arabs must have noticed the\r\ndeflagration of at least one of them when a fire was lit on it. These\r\nefflorescences consist of various salts,—sulphate and carbonate of\r\nsoda, chloride of sodium, saltpetre, &c.—but they are so similar\r\nin appearance and taste, the only two criteria known in primitive\r\ntimes,[19] that early observers succeeded in discriminating only one of\r\nthem, common salt, from the rest. So close, in fact, is the resemblance\r\nbetween potash and soda, that their radical difference was only finally\r\nestablished by Du Hamel in 1736. Common salt received a distinctive\r\nname in remote times; all other salts were grouped together under such\r\nvague generic names as _nitrum_, _natron_, _afro-nitron_, &c.\r\n\r\nNo trace of saltpetre has hitherto been found anywhere before the\r\nthirteenth century. The Greek alchemists of preceding centuries are\r\nsilent. There is no saltpetre in the earliest recipe we possess for\r\nGreek fire, No. 26 of the _Liber Ignium_,[20] ascribed to one Marcus\r\nGræcus, either as given in the Paris MSS. of 1300, or in the Munich MS.\r\nof 1438. It is true that the phrase _sal coctus_ in this recipe has\r\nbeen translated by _saltpetre_ in M. Hœfer’s untrustworthy _Histoire\r\nde la Chimie_, but as MM. Reinaud and Favé remark: “Rien n’autorise\r\nà traduire ainsi; le sel ordinaire a été souvent employé dans les\r\nartifices.”[21] There is no instance in Latin, I believe, of saltpetre\r\nbeing designated otherwise than by _sal petræ_ (or _petrosus_), or by\r\n_nitrum_, singly or in combination with some other word, as _spuma\r\nnitri_. The substitution of _sal petræ_ for _sal coctus_, in later\r\neditions of the recipe, only shows that when the valuable properties\r\nof saltpetre became known it was employed instead of common salt.\r\nThe very fact of the change having been made by most of the later\r\nalchemists, proves that to them _sal coctus_ did not mean _sal petræ_,\r\nbut something else. If _sal coctus_ had meant _sal petræ_, what need\r\nwas there for the change? This change, however, was not universal.\r\nIn the version of recipe 26, given in the _Livre de Canonnerie et\r\nArtifice de Feu_, published in Paris in 1561, but written long before\r\nby a fire-worker well acquainted with saltpetre, we find: “prenez\r\nsoufre vif, tarte, farcocoly (sarcocolla), peghel (pitch), sarcosti\r\n(sal coctum), &c.”[22] The word _coquo_ (to boil or evaporate)\r\nwas necessarily connected with the preparation of common salt by\r\nevaporation,[23] and _coctus_ would correctly distinguish evaporated or\r\nartificial salt from natural or rock salt. In his “Natural History,”\r\nxxxi. 39 (7), Pliny tells us that salt is found round the edges of\r\ncertain lakes in Sicily which are partially dried up in summer by the\r\nheat of the sun; while in Phrygia, where much greater evaporation\r\ntakes place (_ubi largius coquitur_), a lake is dried up (and salt\r\nis deposited) to its very middle. _Sal coctus_ was salt recovered\r\nfrom salt water by natural or artificial heat, as distinguished from\r\nnatural, or rock salt, which was dug out of the ground.[24]\r\n\r\nThe Arab alchemists before the thirteenth century are as silent as the\r\nGreeks: nothing that can be identified with saltpetre is to be found\r\nin their voluminous works. The evidence of Geber, so often cited to\r\nprove that saltpetre was known to the Arabs in the ninth century, has\r\nbeen stripped of all authority by M. Berthelot, who has satisfactorily\r\nproved that there were two Gebers. The real Arab, Jabir, says nothing\r\nof saltpetre, but he mentions a salve used by naphtha-throwers[25]\r\nas a safeguard against burns. The other Geber, or pseudo-Jabir, was\r\nacquainted with saltpetre, as well he might be; for he was a western\r\nwho lived some time about the year 1300,[26] and wrote a number of\r\nLatin works falsely purporting to be translations from the Arabic\r\nof the real Jabir. All doubt about the matter has been removed by\r\nM. Berthelot’s publication of the real Jabir’s Arabic writings.[27]\r\nIt has been also suspected that the _sal Indicus_ of the _Liber\r\nSacerdotum, cir._ tenth century,[28] a salt again mentioned in the\r\n_Liber Secretorum_ of Bubacar, _cir._ 1000,[29] means saltpetre. Both\r\nthese works are translations from the Arabic or Persian,[30] and _sal\r\nIndicus_ is the literal translation of the Persian—نمك هندي (nimaki\r\nHindi) = نمك سياه (nimaki siyah) = salt of bitumen; a substance of\r\nthe same family as the “salt of naphtha” also mentioned by Bubacar.\r\n\r\nThere is no word for saltpetre in classical Sanskrit, _sauverchala_\r\nbeing a generic term for natural salts, which corresponded to, and\r\nwas as comprehensive as the _nitrum_, _spuma nitri_, &c., of the\r\nWest. “Recent Sanskrit formulæ for the preparation of mineral acids\r\ncontaining nitre, mention this salt under the name of _soraka_. This\r\nword, however, is not met with in any Sanskrit dictionary, and is\r\nevidently Sanskritised from the vernacular _sora_, a term of foreign\r\norigin.”[31] Both Professor H. H. Wilson and Professor M. Williams,\r\nin their Sanskrit dictionaries, “erroneously render _yavakshara_ as\r\nsaltpetre, as also does Colebrooke in his ‘Amara-kosha.’”[32] The word\r\nmeans impure carbonate of potash obtained by the incineration of barley\r\nstraw.[33]\r\n\r\nAt length, however, notwithstanding coarse scales and clumsy apparatus,\r\nthe want of all means of registering time and temperature, and the\r\nabsence of any general principle to guide them in their researches,\r\nthe alchemists succeeded in differentiating certain natural salts\r\nfrom the rest, and among them saltpetre. The Chinese were acquainted\r\nwith it about the middle of the thirteenth century.[34] Abd Allah ibn\r\nal-Baythar, who died at Damascus in 1248, tells us that the _flower\r\nof the stone of Assos_ was called _Chinese snow_ by the Egyptian\r\nphysicians and _barūd_ (_i.e._ saltpetre) by the (Arab) people of\r\nthe West.[35] Friar Bacon, whose _De Secretis_ was written before 1249,\r\nand Hassan er-Rammah who wrote 1275-95, were thoroughly acquainted\r\nwith the salt. A grand chemical discovery had been made, and saltpetre\r\nbecame known from China to Spain.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians thought fit to call saltpetre “Chinese snow,” but this\r\ndoes not justify the conclusion that the discovery was made by the\r\nChinese. Consider our own phrases “Jerusalem” artichoke, “Welsh” onion,\r\nand “Turkey” cock. Jerusalem is a gardener’s corruption of _girasole_,\r\nthe Turkey came from America, and the home of the Welsh onion is\r\nSiberia. The Persians called their native alkaline salt _jamadi Chini_,\r\nand no one will suggest that this substance came from China.\r\n\r\nIt is evident from the way in which it is mentioned by the alchemists\r\nof the thirteenth century, and from their primitive methods of refining\r\nit, that saltpetre was then in its infancy. Roger Bacon speaks of it\r\nas one would speak of a substance recently discovered and still little\r\nknown—“that salt which is called saltpetre” (_illius salis qui sal\r\npetræ vocatur_).[36] Marcus Græcus thought it necessary to explain what\r\nthe word means, in his 14th recipe which probably belongs to the latter\r\nyears of the thirteenth century.[37] The methods of refining the salt\r\ngiven by Marcus and Hassan leave no possible doubt that in their time\r\nit had but just come into use. It is true that Bacon’s method was much\r\nsuperior, if the solution of his steganogram given in Chap. viii. be\r\naccepted. But it would have been past all explanation had the method of\r\nthe greatest natural philosopher of the age been found to be no better\r\nthan that of an Arabic druggist or a European fireworker.\r\n\r\nAs the matter is one of the greatest importance, the methods of all\r\nthree are given in full, together with that of Whitehorne, 1560. The\r\nWaltham Abbey method is added, as a standard by which to judge them. To\r\nadmit of easy comparison, the corresponding operations are marked with\r\nthe same letter. The five methods are summed up in Table I.\r\n\r\n\r\nWALTHAM ABBEY, 1860.\r\n\r\nA. _Preparation of grough from natural saltpetre._[38]\r\n\r\nNatural saltpetre is dissolved in boiling water, the insoluble\r\nimpurities removed, and the solution evaporated by the sun or\r\nartificial heat. The solid residue is grough saltpetre, and contains 1\r\nto 10 per cent. of impurities, consisting of the chlorides of potassium\r\nand sodium, sulphates of potash, soda, and calcium, vegetable matter,\r\nsand, and moisture.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. _Boiling the solution of grough saltpetre._\r\n\r\nThe grough saltpetre is placed in an open copper with a false bottom;\r\nwater is added, and heat applied until the mixture boils at 110° C.\r\n\r\n\r\nC. _Removal of the insoluble impurities._\r\n\r\nThe scum which rises to the surface during this operation is removed by\r\nladles; the sand and heavy impurities fall upon the false bottom, which\r\nis removed just before the mixture boils. The boiling is continued\r\nuntil the scum ceases to rise.\r\n\r\n\r\nD. _Second boiling of the solution._\r\n\r\nCold water is added; the solution is boiled for a few minutes, and then\r\nallowed to cool somewhat.\r\n\r\n\r\nE. _Filtration._\r\n\r\nAt 104.5° C. the mother liquid is transferred to a tank with holes in\r\nits bottom, closed by filters.\r\n\r\n\r\nF. _Use of wood-ash, charcoal, &c._\r\n\r\nIf the impurities prevent the liquid from passing freely through the\r\nfilters, it is treated with glue, wood-ash, or, better, with a little\r\nanimal charcoal, which seizes on the impurities and rises to the top as\r\nscum.\r\n\r\n\r\nG. _Crystallisation._\r\n\r\nThe mother liquid filters into the crystallising trough at 70.2° to\r\n65.8° C.\r\n\r\n\r\nH. _Stirring the depositing solution._\r\n\r\nThe solution is kept in constant agitation by poles whilst cooling, in\r\norder that it may deposit in minute crystals, called _saltpetre flour_.\r\nLarge crystals contain more or less of the impure mother liquid.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. _Washing and drying._\r\n\r\nThe agitation is discontinued at 25.8° C. and the mother liquid drawn\r\noff. The flour is drained on an inclined plane, transferred to a\r\nwashing vat, where it is washed three times with cold water, and then\r\nfinally dried.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITEHORNE, 1560.\r\n\r\nA. _Preparation of grough from natural saltpetre._\r\n\r\nOn the bottom of a vessel pierced with “three or fower littell holes”\r\nis placed a linen cloth, “or else the end of a broom, or some straw.”\r\nA layer of nitrified earth, “a spanne thicknesse,” is laid on this,\r\nand on the earth “three fingers’ thicknesse” of a mixture of “two parts\r\nof unslacked lime and three of oke asshes, or other asshes.... And so,\r\nputting one rewe” of saltpetre alternately with one of the mixture,\r\n“you shall fill the tubbe ... within a spanne of (its mouth), and the\r\nrest you will fill with water.” The water, on percolating through the\r\nmass, drips into a brass cauldron which, when two-thirds full, is\r\nboiled “till it come to one-third part or thereabouts. And after take\r\nit off and put it to settell in a great vessell,” when it is to be\r\n“clarified and from earthe and grosse matter diligentlie purged.”\r\n\r\n\r\nB. _Boiling the solution of grough saltpetre._\r\n\r\nThe solution is then “taken and boyled of new.”\r\n\r\n\r\nF. _Use of wood-ash, animal charcoal, &c._\r\n\r\nWhen the solution boils and throws up scum, it is treated with a\r\nmixture of “3 parts of oke asshes and 1 of lime, together with 4 lbs.\r\nof rock alum to every 100 lbs. of the mother liquid.” “In a little time\r\nyou shall see it alaie, both clear and fair and of an azure colour.”\r\n\r\n\r\nC. _Removal of insoluble impurities._\r\n\r\nThe heavy impurities, which sink to the bottom, are got rid of by\r\npouring the clarified mother liquid into another vessel.\r\n\r\n\r\nG. _Crystallisation._\r\n\r\n“Take it out and put it in vessels of woode or of earth that are rough\r\nwithin, with certain sticks of wood, to congeal.”\r\n\r\n\r\nI. _Washing and drying._\r\n\r\n“This same saltpeter being taken from the sides of the vessel where\r\nit congealed, and in the water thereof washed, you must lay it upon a\r\ntable to drie throughly.”\r\n\r\n\r\nF´.[39] _Use of wood-ash, animal charcoal, &c._\r\n\r\n“Minding to have (saltpetre) above the common use, for some purpose,\r\nmore purified, &c. (which for to make exceeding fine powder, or aqua\r\nfortis, is most requisite so to be):—take of the aforesaid mixture (F)\r\n... and for every barrel of water you have put in the cauldron ... you\r\nmust put into it five potfulls” of the mixture. “In the same quantity\r\nof water so prepared, put so much saltpeter as it will dissolve.”\r\n\r\n\r\nD. _Second boiling of the solution._\r\n\r\nBoil the whole until it “resolve very well.”\r\n\r\n\r\nE. _Filtration._\r\n\r\nWhen the scum rises, transfer the mother liquid to a tub with holes in\r\nthe bottom, on which is laid a linen cloth covered with a layer of\r\nsand four finger-breadths deep.\r\n\r\n\r\nD´. _Third boiling of the solution._\r\n\r\nThe filtered liquid is boiled again “in order to make the greater part\r\nof the water seeth away.... Make it boil so much until you see it ready\r\nto thicken, pouring in now and then a little of the mixture” (F).\r\n\r\n\r\nG´. _Final crystallisation._\r\n\r\nThe mother liquid is then transferred to wooden troughs “to congeal,”\r\nfor which three or four days are allowed. “After this sort thou shalt\r\nmake the saltpeter most white and fair, and much better than at the\r\nfirst setting.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“LIBER IGNIUM,” _cir._ 1300.\r\n\r\nA. _Preparation of grough from natural saltpetre._\r\n\r\nIf natural saltpetre is dissolved in boiling water, cleansed, and\r\npassed through a filter, and boiled for a day and a night; the (grough)\r\nsaltpetre will be found deposited in crystals at the bottom of the\r\nvessel.\r\n\r\nThe original is as follows:—\r\n\r\n“Nota, quod sal petrosum est minera terræ et reperitur in scrophulis\r\ncontra lapides. Hæc terra dissolvitur in aqua bulliente, postea\r\ndepurata et distillata per filtrum et permittatur per diem et noctem\r\nintegram decoqui, et invenies in fundo laminas salis conielatas\r\ncristallinas.”[40]\r\n\r\n\r\nHASSAN ER-RAMMAH, 1275-95.\r\n\r\nA. _Preparation of grough from natural saltpetre._\r\n\r\n“Take white, clean, bright (natural) saltpetre _ad lib._, and two new\r\n(earthen) jars. Put the saltpetre into one of them, and add some water.\r\nPut the jar on a gentle fire until it gets warm” (and the saltpetre\r\ndissolves. Skim off) “the scum that rises” (and) “throw it away. Stir\r\nup the fire until the liquid becomes quite clear. Then pour it into the\r\nother jar in such a way that no scum remains attached to it. Place this\r\njar on a low fire until the contents begin to coagulate. Then take it\r\noff the fire, and beat (the crystals) gently.”\r\n\r\n\r\nF. _Use of wood-ash, animal charcoal, &c._\r\n\r\n“Take dry willow wood, burn it, and plunge it into water according to\r\nthe recipe for its incineration. Take three parts by weight of the\r\nsaltpetre” (just obtained), “and the third of a part of the wood-ash,\r\nwhich has been carefully pulverised, and put the mixture into a jar—if\r\nmade of brass, so much the better.”\r\n\r\n\r\nB. _Boiling the solution of grough saltpetre._\r\n\r\n“Add water and apply heat, until the ashes and saltpetre no longer\r\nadhere together. Beware of sparks.”\r\n\r\nThe original is as follows:—[41]\r\n\r\n                        باب\r\n                   صثة حل البارود\r\n          يوخذ البارود الابيض النقى النارى مهما اردت وتاخذ\r\n        طاجنين جدد ويحط فى الطاجن الواحد ويغمر بالماء ويوقد\r\n  عليه نار لينة حتى يفتر وتطلع رغوته فارمها واوقد تحته جيدا\r\n      حتى يروق ماؤه الى غاية ويقلب الماء الرايق قى طاجن اخر\r\n         بحيث لا يتراك من التفل شى ويوخذ عليه وقدا لطيفا الى\r\n            ان يجمد وتشيله وتصحنه ناعما ويوخذ الحطب الصفصاف\r\n           اليابس يحرق ويغمر على صفة الحراق ويزن من البارود\r\n     الثلثين والثلث من رماد الفحع الذى صحنته بالميزان ويعاد\r\n         الى الطاجنين وان كانت الاعادة فى طاجن نحاس فهو اجود\r\n        ويعمل عليه قليل ماء وتحمصه بحيث ان لا يلتزق واحذو من\r\n                                                  شرر النار\r\n\r\n\r\nROGER BACON, _cir._ 1248.\r\n\r\nA. _Preparation of grough from natural saltpetre._\r\n\r\nCarefully wash the natural saltpetre, and (as far as possible) remove\r\nall impurities.

It is said by some that although saltpetre was unknown to the\r\nrest of the world until then, it had been secretly used by the Greeks\r\nfor five hundred years. This theory will be examined in the following\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE GREEKS\r\n\r\n\r\nHomer knew nothing apparently of incendiary compositions. When the\r\nTrojans set fire to the Greek ships, he certainly says that they burned\r\nwith “unquenchable flame” (ἀσβέστη φλόξ), _Iliad_, xvi. 123; but this\r\nis a mere figure of speech, for presently afterwards he tells us that\r\nPatroclus extinguished the fire (κατὰ δ’ ἔσβεσεν αἰθόμενον πῦρ), 293.\r\n\r\nThe Assyrian bas-reliefs in the British Museum prove that liquid fire\r\nwas used in warfare in very remote times. Whether the Greeks adopted\r\nits use from the Orientals or originated it themselves, there is\r\nlittle evidence to show; but traces of it are found at an early date,\r\nfor instance at the siege of Syracuse,[44] 413 B.C., and the siege of\r\nRhodes,[45] 304 B.C. Vessels full of burning matter were thrown, at\r\nfirst by hand, from walls and the tops of forts upon besiegers; and\r\nwhen shell of suitable construction had been devised, these missiles\r\nwere discharged from machines.\r\n\r\nThe earliest instance of the use of firearms by the Greeks is found in\r\nThucydides, ii. 75, where it is stated that at the siege of Platæa,\r\n429 B.C., the Platæans found it necessary to protect a wooden wall by\r\nskins and hides against the fire-arrows (πυρφόροις ὀïστοῖς) of their\r\nPeloponnesian besiegers. By the time of the Roman Empire, fire-arrows\r\nwere so well known as to be mentioned by the Latin poets,[46] and the\r\nhistorians speak of fire-lances which were discharged from machines[47]\r\n(_adactæ tormentis ardentes hastæ_). Vegetius, who lived in the fourth\r\ncentury A.D., gives the composition of fire-arrows;[48] and Ammianus\r\nMarcellinus, who lived about the same time, points out their defects.\r\nFirst, the fire-arrow had to be discharged with a low velocity—_ictu\r\nenim rapidiore extinguitur_; it was extinguished by the cooling effect\r\nof the air when discharged with the full force of the bow. Secondly,\r\nin addition to its low velocity (and consequently limited range) it\r\nwas extinguished when covered with clay.[49] However, the composition\r\nwas easy to light and hard to put out—even with clay or vinegar; its\r\nviscosity enabled it to stick to the body it struck; and, becoming more\r\nand more fluid from the heat of combustion, it “spread like wild-fire.”\r\n\r\nBut the use of incendiaries was not confined to grenades and arrows. At\r\nthe siege of Platæa, just referred to, the Spartans piled up faggots of\r\nbrushwood against the walls, and, after pouring a mixture of sulphur\r\nand pitch on the heap, set fire to it in order to burn the town.[50]\r\nThey would have gained their object but for a rainstorm which put out\r\nthe fire. We have here perhaps the earliest historical account of the\r\ncomposition of an incendiary—429 B.C. At the siege of Delium, 424\r\nB.C., a tree was cut down and hollowed out, so as to form a tube, and\r\nfrom one end of it, which was protected by a covering of iron, was\r\nhung a cauldron containing a burning mixture of charcoal, sulphur, and\r\npitch. Into this cauldron was introduced an iron bellows-pipe, leading\r\nfrom the end of the tree from which it hung. Having transported the\r\nmachine close to the wall of the town (the cauldron to the front), the\r\nbesiegers inserted the snout of a large bellows into the other end of\r\nthe hollowed tree, and blew them. A great flame was thus produced; the\r\nwall, in which there was much wood, was set on fire; the heat of the\r\nfire and the vapour of the incendiary drove the defenders from the\r\nwalls, and the town fell.[51] Its simplicity shows that the mixture\r\nbelongs to the infancy of incendiaries in Greece.\r\n\r\nWe meet with fire-ships as early as 413 B.C., when the Syracusians\r\nemployed one ineffectually against the Athenian fleet;[52] and\r\na special incendiary for naval use is recommended by Æneas, the\r\ntactician, about 350 B.C. It consisted of sulphur, pitch, incense,\r\npine-wood, and tow. The mixture was stowed in egg-shaped, wooden\r\nvessels, admirably adapted for their purpose, which were thrown lighted\r\nupon the enemy’s decks.[53]\r\n\r\nTABLE II.\r\n\r\n_Greek Fires._\r\n\r\n\r\n  +-----------------+------------------+------------------+------------+---------------+-------------------------+\r\n  |   Æneas.[54]    |  Vegetius.[55]   | Liber Ignium.[56]| Kyeser.[57]| Wild Fire.[68]| Carcass Composition.[59]|\r\n  | _cir._ 350 B.C. | _cir._ A.D. 350. |   1200-1225.     |    1405.   |     1560.     |          1903.          |\r\n  +-----------------+------------------+------------------+------------+---------------+-------------------------+\r\n  | Sulphur         | Sulphur          | Sulphur          | Sulphur    | Sulphur       | Sulphur                 |\r\n  |                 |                  |                  |            |               |                         |\r\n  | Pitch           | Bitumen          | Pitch            |    ...     | Pitch         | Tallow                  |\r\n  |                 |                  |                  |            |               |                         |\r\n  | Pine-wood[60]   | Rosin            | Sarcocolla[61]   |    ...     |  Charcoal     | Rosin                   |\r\n  |                 |                  |                  |            |               |                         |\r\n  | Incense         | Naphtha          | Petroleum        | Petroleum  | Turpentine    | Turpentine              |\r\n  |                 |                  |                  |            |               |                         |\r\n  | Tow             |    ...           | Sal Coctus[62]   | Salfanium? | Bay Salt     | Crude Antimony          |\r\n  |                 |                  |                  |            |               |                         |\r\n  |    ...          |    ...           | Oil of Gemma     |    ...     |    ...        |     ...                 |\r\n  |                 |                  |                  |            |               |                         |\r\n  |    ...          |    ...           | Tartarum[63]     | Saltpetre  | Saltpetre     | Saltpetre               |\r\n  +-----------------+------------------+------------------+------------+---------------+-------------------------+\r\n\r\nIn such ways were incendiaries employed by the Greeks for nearly eleven\r\ncenturies after the siege of Platæa. During this long period the\r\ncomposition was of course improved, and the mixture of the seventh\r\ncentury A.D. burned more fiercely, and was harder to put out than that\r\nof the fourth century B.C.; but nevertheless the two mixtures were of\r\nthe same species. At length, in the decade 670-80, a new species was\r\ndevised. For the sake of clearness, the old incendiary mixtures will\r\nhenceforward be called Greek fire; the new one “sea-fire.”\r\n\r\nWe are told by Theophanes in his “Chronography,” written 811-815,\r\nthat in the year 673 an architect called Kallinikos[64] fled from\r\nHeliopolis in Syria to the Romans (_i.e._ Constantinople), and\r\neventually compounded a “sea-fire” which enabled them to burn large\r\nnumbers of the Moslem vessels engaged in the Seven Years’ War,[65]\r\n671-677. This incendiary was again employed with success against the\r\nMoslems during their second attack against Constantinople, 717, and at\r\nthe decisive naval victory over the Russians under Igor in 941. The\r\nevidence of Theophanes about Kallinikos is corroborated almost verbally\r\nby the Emperor Constantine VII., Porphyrogenitus, in Chap. xlviii.\r\nof his “Administration of the Empire”: “Be it known that under the\r\nreign of Constantine Pogonatus (668-685) one Kallinikos, who fled from\r\nHeliopolis to the Romans, prepared a ‘wet-fire’ to be discharged from\r\nsiphons, by means of which the Romans burned the fleet of the Saracens\r\nat Cyzicus and gained the victory.”[66] It is true that when writing to\r\nhis son (in Chap. xiii. of the same work) the Emperor gives (or tells\r\nhis son to give) a different version of the invention of sea-fire:\r\n“If any persons venture to inquire of you how this fire is prepared,\r\nwithstand them and dismiss them with some such answer as this—that\r\nthe secret was revealed by an angel to the first Emperor Constantine”\r\n(A.D. 323-337).[67] But this passage only proves that the Emperor was\r\nmendacious and his people superstitious. There can be little doubt\r\nthat this great invention was made by a Greek for the Greeks in the\r\ndecade 670-680; but what was the nature of the mixture? All we know\r\nfor certain about it is that it was a State secret, was intended for\r\nsea service, burned with much noise and vapour, and was projected\r\nfrom siphons. In other words, the mixture fulfilled the following\r\nconditions:—\r\n\r\n(1) Its composition could be kept secret.\r\n\r\n(2) It had some close connection with the sea, or water.\r\n\r\n(3) It burned with much noise and smoke.\r\n\r\n(4) It had some close connection with siphons, or tubes.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the sea-fire was made a State secret proves that it did\r\nnot belong to the same family as the Greek fire of Æneas and Vegetius\r\nwhich, in one form or another, had been known all over the East\r\nfrom time immemorial. It was a new mixture—_i.e._ either a mixture\r\ncontaining some substance not hitherto known, or a mixture of known\r\nsubstances not hitherto combined together for warlike purposes. Many\r\nhold that an unknown substance was employed, and, further, that it\r\nwas no other than saltpetre. We might, of course, fall back on the\r\nconclusion established in Chap. ii., and reply that saltpetre was\r\nnot discovered until the thirteenth century and could not have been\r\nused as an ingredient of an incendiary in the seventh century. But\r\nthe conclusion drawn in Chap. ii. was not a certain one: it was there\r\ncharacterised as highly probable. Saltpetre might possibly have been\r\nemployed, and a belief which is shared in by some good writers deserves\r\nrespectful consideration. We have, therefore, to investigate how far a\r\nsaltpetre mixture would satisfy the above four conditions.\r\n\r\nThere was absolutely nothing to attract public attention in the\r\npurchase from time to time of common, well-known substances, such\r\nas sulphur, quicklime, naphtha, &c. &c., by the authorities of the\r\nArsenal; but the suspicions of the spies and traitors, always to be\r\nfound in Constantinople,[68] would have been instantly roused by the\r\nimportation of any new or rare substance such as saltpetre. And whence\r\ncould saltpetre have come? M. Berthelot recognises the importance of\r\nthis question, although he cannot answer it: “Comment se procurait-on\r\nle salpêtre?... Aucun renseignment n’est venu nous l’apprendre. Ce\r\npoint pourtant est capital.”[69] Saltpetre would naturally have\r\nbeen obtained from the countries where it was most abundant and\r\ncheapest—from the East; but the Greeks could not have relied upon this\r\nsource of supply, for whenever political complications arose between\r\nthe Emperor and the Caliph—and they were interminable—the ports of\r\nEgypt and Syria were closed against Greek ships. However, saltpetre\r\ndid not grow in the streets of Constantinople: the natural salt (if\r\nused) must have been collected _somewhere_, and sold to Government by\r\n_someone_, and transported _somehow_ to the capital; and what despot\r\ncould have tied the tongues of collectors, merchants, sailors, and\r\nporters? The mere facts that only one State trafficked in saltpetre,\r\nthat this State only bought it in time of war, and that this State\r\nalone employed sea-fire, would have immediately betrayed the secret\r\nof its composition to these men, and what was known to them was known\r\nto the world. It is most improbable that the use of saltpetre could\r\nhave been concealed for one year, much less the five hundred years\r\nduring which the secret of the sea-fire was successfully guarded. I\r\nmay be reminded of the Emperor Constantine VII.’s statement (in Chap.\r\nxiii. of his “Administration, &c.”), that on one occasion a Roman\r\ngeneral, corrupted by a large bribe, did reveal the secret and shortly\r\nafterwards, when entering a church, was consumed by fire which fell\r\nfrom heaven upon him. The story is obviously legendary. The venal\r\ngeneral is as unreal as the fire from heaven; he is merely introduced\r\nto us as “an awful example,” and we cannot endow him with reality by\r\nrejecting the fire. The claim of the Marquess Carabbas to reality is\r\nnot established by denying the existence of Puss-in-Boots. Had the\r\nsecret been divulged the sea-fire would have been used against the\r\nGreeks, and no mixture that can be identified with it ever was.\r\n\r\nA saltpetre mixture, then, would not, in all probability, have\r\nfulfilled the first condition, nor would it have fulfilled the second.\r\nThere is no conceivable connection between saltpetre and the sea, or\r\nwater in general. A saltpetre mixture (of suitable proportions) would\r\nhave proved a much better incendiary than Greek fire, but it would have\r\nacted as effectively from a fort as from a ship. Indeed, if we consider\r\nthe ill effect of the moist sea air on the impure saltpetre of early\r\ntimes, we are justified in saying that the action of such mixtures on\r\nland would have been better, in general, than at sea.\r\n\r\nA saltpetre mixture would have fulfilled the third condition by burning\r\nwith much noise and smoke, which we may suppose to be the essential\r\nmeaning of the Emperor Leo’s phrase, “thunder and smoke.”[70] We\r\ncannot reasonably attach greater significance to one of the commonest\r\nof all metaphors, thunder, which has been applied times unnumbered to\r\nthe human voice, to the bursting of a child’s cracker,[71] and to the\r\nwhirring of a dart. “Never burst such peals from the thunder-cloud,”\r\nsays Vergil, as were produced by the javelin thrown by Æneas.[72]\r\n\r\nAs regards the fourth condition, the above statement of the Emperor\r\nConstantine about sea-fire and siphons[73] completely justifies us\r\nin concluding that there was some necessary connection between the\r\ntwo things. Now, there was no necessary connection between saltpetre\r\nmixtures, even when explosive, and siphons. Small quantities of such\r\nmixtures could have been, and eventually were, thrown by hand, in\r\ngrenades, like Greek fire. Saltpetre mixtures, therefore, would not\r\nhave fulfilled the fourth condition.\r\n\r\nThe result of the foregoing inquiry is, that a saltpetre mixture would\r\nhave only fulfilled one, the third, of the four conditions to which the\r\nsea-fire was subject; and we have now to cast about for some mixture of\r\nknown substances, not hitherto combined together for warlike purposes,\r\nwhich would have fulfilled them all.\r\n\r\nA clue to the composition of the Kallinikos mixture may perhaps be\r\nfound in its Greek name, “sea-fire” or “wet-fire.” One substance\r\nhad long been known with whose combustion water was closely\r\nconnected—quicklime, and with its properties Kallinikos, as an\r\narchitect, must have been perfectly familiar. Its temperature rises—to\r\n150° C. (302° F.) if the quantity be large—when sprinkled with water,\r\nand it can consequently be employed to ignite substances with low\r\npoints of ignition. For example, if a mixture of quicklime and naphtha\r\nbe thrown into water, the rapid rise in temperature of the lime causes\r\na sudden and strong development of vapour from the naphtha, which on\r\nmixing with the air becomes highly explosive. Such a mixture, it is\r\nalmost unnecessary to add, could not be handled with safety _after_ it\r\nhas been wet. Plutarch was aware of the explosive nature of naphtha\r\nvapour. “Naphtha,” he says, “is like bitumen, and is so easy to set\r\non fire that, without touching it with any flame, it will catch light\r\nfrom the rays which are sent forth from a fire, burning the air which\r\nis between both.”[74] Pliny speaks of the heat developed by quicklime\r\nwhen sprinkled with water. “It is strange,” he says, “that what has\r\nalready been burnt should be ignited by water” (_mirum aliquid,\r\npostquam arserit, accendi aquis_).[75] The same property is implicitly\r\nreferred to in the “Kestoi,” attributed to Sextus Julius Africanus\r\nof Emaus, who lived under Alexander Severus, 222-235. The military\r\nportions of this work, however, must have been written long afterwards,\r\nin the end of the sixth or the beginning of the seventh century at the\r\nearliest; for Belisarius, who was born in 505, is mentioned in the\r\nsixty-sixth chapter.[76] In the forty-fifth chapter there is a recipe\r\nfor a quicklime-asphalt composition, which is called “automatic fire.”\r\nThis mixture was used by jugglers to exhibit “spontaneous combustion,”\r\na little water being secretly poured on a plate on which a ball of\r\nthe composition was placed.[77] It contained very little quicklime\r\n(παντελῶς ὀλίγον). Cameniata tells us that at the storming of Salonika\r\nin 904 the Moslems threw “pitch and torches and quicklime” over the\r\nwalls.[78] By “quicklime” he probably meant the earthenware hand\r\ngrenades, filled with wet quicklime, described by the Emperor Leo,\r\nwho then sat on the throne (886-911). “The vapour of the quicklime,”\r\nhe says, “when the pots are broken, stifles and chokes the enemy and\r\ndistracts his soldiers.”[79]\r\n\r\nThe simplest and most probable explanation of the nature of the\r\nsea-fire then is, that it was a sulphur-quicklime-naphtha mixture of\r\nthe same family as those shown in the following Table.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE III.\r\n\r\n_Sea-Fires._\r\n\r\n  +------------------+------------------+--------------------+------------+------------------+\r\n  | Liber Ignium.[80]| Liber Ignium.[81]| De Mirabilibus.[82]| Kyeser.[83]| Hartlieb.[84]    |\r\n  | _cir._ 1300.     |  _cir._ 1350     |  _cir._ 1350.      |    1405.   | _cir._ 1425.     |\r\n  +------------------+------------------+--------------------+------------+------------------+\r\n  | Sulphur.         | Sulphur.         | Sulphur.           | Sulphur.   | Sulphur(Oil of). |\r\n  | Quicklime.       | Quicklime.       | Quicklime.         | Quicklime. | Quicklime.       |\r\n  | Oil              | Turpentine.      | Naphtha.           | Petroleum. | Mastic.          |\r\n  | Gum Arabic.      | ...              | Wax.               | Wax.       | Gum Arabic.      |\r\n  | ...              | ...              | Oil of Balm.       | ...        | ...              |\r\n  +------------------+------------------+--------------------+------------+------------------+\r\n\r\n  _N.B._—None of these mixtures professes to be the\r\n  official Greek sea-fire, the exact composition of which\r\n  is unknown; but the “De Mirabilibus” mixture is probably\r\n  a close approximation to it. Although called sea-fires\r\n  here, they were not so called by their western authors,\r\n  who were ignorant of the use and even of the name of\r\n  sea-fire. The first four recipes are described as\r\n  mixtures which will ignite “when rain falls upon them.”\r\n  Hartlieb alone foresaw that such mixtures would ignite\r\n  “if thrown upon water.”\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch a mixture would have completely fulfilled the four conditions\r\nalready mentioned. First, the secret of its composition was\r\neasy to keep, since it lay in the choice and proportions of known\r\ningredients; not in the use of one special and unknown substance (such\r\nas saltpetre), smuggled privily into the Arsenal[85] with a mystery\r\nwhich was certain to excite the curiosity of a people who “spent their\r\ntime in nothing else, but either to tell or to hear some new thing.”\r\nSecondly, it was literally a “sea-fire” or “wet-fire,”—a fire which\r\nwas ignited by water and which burned on its surface. Thirdly, its\r\ncombustion gave rise to a considerable volume of vapour and a series of\r\nsmall explosions in the air. Fourthly, from the mode of its combustion\r\nit was unsafe to handle after ignition, and it was necessarily\r\ndischarged from siphons. This simple explanation of the sea-fire[86]\r\nsweeps away the insurmountable difficulties raised by the saltpetre\r\ntheory. We have no longer to believe in the patriotic silence of\r\nByzantine officials, workmen and sailors, maintained for five hundred\r\nyears; we have no longer to admit reluctantly that saltpetre was known\r\nin Greece, where it occurs in comparatively scanty quantity, five\r\nhundred years before it was known in the great natural storehouse of\r\nthis salt, Asia; we have no longer to suspect the whole body of Greek\r\nwriters on alchemy and pharmacy, from the seventh to the thirteenth\r\ncentury, of having entered into a vast conspiracy of silence to hide\r\ntheir knowledge of saltpetre from the barbarians; we are no longer left\r\nwondering whence the Greeks got their saltpetre, and why they gave the\r\nname of “sea-fire” to a mixture in no way connected with the sea; and\r\nwe are no longer perplexed by the fact that the earliest recipes for\r\nGreek fire contain no saltpetre.[87]\r\n\r\nIt remains to inquire how the sea-fire was expelled from the siphons.\r\n\r\nThere were two kinds of siphons, large siphons and hand-siphons.\r\n\r\nOf the hand-siphons there were several patterns. Some seem to have been\r\nthrown by hand, like squibs;[88] from others, mentioned by Cameniata,\r\nthe charge was projected by air[89]—presumably by a bellows or some\r\nsuch contrivance; while in a third kind, described by the Princess\r\nAnna, a pellet was blown by the breath through a flame placed before\r\nthe front end of the tube.[90] The two latter siphons were of the same\r\nspecies, and as Anna’s was charged with Greek fire[91] we may suppose\r\nCameniata’s took a similar charge.\r\n\r\nThe large sea-fire siphon was fixed in the bow of the ship and served\r\nby the two foremost rowers, one of whom laid the siphon and was called\r\nthe siphonator, while the other, we may suppose, loaded it. The siphon\r\nwas mounted on a swivel, as may be gathered from the account given by\r\nthe Princess Anna of the naval battle fought near the island of Rhodes\r\nin 1103 by the Greeks and the Pisans. The latter were terrified, she\r\nsays, by an apparatus which directed on them fire of an extraordinary\r\nnature. “Ordinary flame rises upwards, but this flame shot downwards\r\nand sideways as well, at the will of the gunner.”[92] Unless the siphon\r\nwas mounted on a swivel, the phrase which I have translated by “at the\r\nwill of the gunner” (ἐφ’ ἃ βούλεται ὁ πέμπων) would be meaningless.\r\n\r\nIn his _Recherche sur le Feu Grégeois_, p. 23, M. Chrétien-Lalanne\r\nmaintains that the incendiary was expelled from the siphon by means\r\nof a spring. This theory is inadmissible, for helical springs are not\r\nheard of until long after the time in question. Further, the ancients\r\npossessed no means of condensing air to the degree necessary for the\r\nprojection of a heavy body over even the short ranges of the Dark Ages,\r\nand steam power had hardly been recognised at all.[93] Therefore, it\r\nhas been urged, the incendiary must have been expelled from the siphon\r\nby means of an explosive saltpetre mixture, this being the only way of\r\neffecting the object that remained at the disposal of the ancients. As\r\nwill be seen presently, there remained a simple and efficacious method,\r\ninvolving very little expense and no danger whatever; a fact which in\r\nitself would be sufficient to meet the above argument in favour of\r\nsaltpetre, even were it unsupported by the evidence already brought\r\nforward in Chap. ii. to show that saltpetre had not been yet discovered\r\nat the time in question, and the evidence adduced in the present\r\nchapter to prove that in fact it was not used. Further, the supposition\r\nthat an explosive was employed is excluded by the construction of the\r\nsiphon, which was made of wood. Such is the only reasonable explanation\r\nthat can be given of the Emperor Leo’s order that the siphons should\r\nbe “cased with bronze.”[94] Had they been of metal, a casing of bronze\r\nwould have been a useless complication; but, being of wood, an internal\r\ncasing of metal was absolutely necessary to protect them from the flame\r\nof the burning composition. Only one round probably could have been\r\nfired from a wooden tube by means of an explosive, and that round in\r\nmost cases would have been more fatal to the siphon detachment than to\r\nthe enemy.\r\n\r\nAgain, as the projectile was simply a lump of oleaginous matter, it\r\nwould have been blown by an explosive cartridge into thousands of\r\nfragments, each of them so small as to be worthless for incendiary\r\npurposes; for the efficacy of an incendiary depends to a great extent\r\non its containing a large quantity of matter.\r\n\r\nSince the use of springs, compressed air, and steam were impossible,\r\nand the use of an explosive extremely improbable, it only remains to\r\nexamine the arguments for and against water as the motive power.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Leo VI. speaks of the “artificial fire discharged by means\r\nof siphons;”[95] the Emperor Constantine VII. speaks similarly of\r\n“the wet-fire projected by means of siphons;”[96] and if we translate\r\n_siphon_ by _tube_ both phrases are intelligible, but neither gives\r\nany hint as to the means by which the mixture was expelled from the\r\ntubes. But like so many other military words, _siphon_ has (at least)\r\ntwo meanings, and signifies not only a tube, but a _fire-engine_, or\r\n_water-engine_, or _squirt_. Heron of Alexandria (_cir._ 130 B.C.)\r\nbegins his description of a fire-engine with the words: “The _siphons_\r\nused for the extinction of fire are made as follows.”[97] Pliny the\r\nYounger (_cir._ 100 A.D.), in a letter to the Emperor Trajan about\r\na fire which had taken place in the town of Nicomedia, observes\r\nthat “there was not a _sipho_, nor even a bucket, at hand to quench\r\nit.”[98] Hesychius in his Greek Lexicon, about the end of the fourth\r\ncentury, gives under σίφων: “an apparatus for pumping water in\r\nconflagrations.”[99] If we translate _siphon_ by _water-engine_, as\r\nwe are perfectly justified in doing, we find that the phrases used by\r\nthe two Emperors are not only intelligible, but indicate both the mode\r\nof projection and the mode of ignition of the sea-fire. The lump of\r\nquicklime-naphtha-sulphur was projected, and at the same time ignited,\r\nby applying the hose of a water-engine to the breech of the tube, which\r\nthus became an integral part of the apparatus to which it gave its name.\r\n\r\nTwo obscure passages in Byzantine works, which hitherto have never been\r\nsatisfactorily explained, are made clear by this interpretation. The\r\nfirst occurs in the “Tactics” of Constantine VIII., where he directs\r\n“‘flexible’ (apparatus) with (artificial) fire, siphons, hand-siphons,\r\nand manjaniks” to be employed, if they are at hand, against any tower\r\nthat may be advanced against the wall of a besieged town.[100] The\r\n“flexible” apparatus cannot refer to the helical springs of a later\r\nage. Neither can it mean crossbows, for the Princess Anna, who wrote\r\na century after Constantine, expressly says: “The crossbow (_tzangra_)\r\nis a foreign weapon (hitherto) unknown in the Greek service.”[101]\r\nThat it cannot mean longbows is quite certain from the second of the\r\nobscure passages in question, which occurs in the “Alexiad”: “In the\r\nbow of each ship he (the Admiral) put the heads of lions and other land\r\nanimals, made of brass and iron, gilt, so as to be (quite) frightful\r\nto look at; and he arranged that from their mouths, which were (wide)\r\nopen, should issue the fire to be delivered by the soldiers by means\r\nof (or through) the ‘flexible’ apparatus.”[102] The enemy might have\r\nexclaimed with the Jewish king: “They gaped upon me with their mouths,\r\nas a ravening and as a roaring lion.” But whatever the moral effect of\r\nthese trumpery scarecrows—if ever actually used—it is certain that\r\narchers with longbows could not have shot fire-arrows through them with\r\nany success; and the meaning of Emperor and Princess remains hidden\r\nuntil we interpret “flexible instrument” as the leathern hose of a pump\r\nor water-engine, than which nothing can be more flexible. The import of\r\nboth passages then becomes perfectly plain. Such a mode of discharging\r\nincendiaries is by no means unknown in later military history. “Dans\r\nune expérience faite au Havre, 1758, avec une pompe à huile de naphte,\r\ndont le jet était enflammé par une mèche allumée, on brûla même\r\nune chaloupe.”[103] At the siege of Charleston, 1863, not only was\r\nsolidified Greek fire in tin tubes employed,[104] but coal naphtha\r\nplaced in shells or pumped through hose.[105] Finally, M. Berthelot\r\nspeaks of “les propositions faites, pendant le siège de Paris (1870),\r\npour repousser les ennemis au moyen de pompes projetant des jets de\r\npétrole enflammé. Mais cet agent ... n’a été mis réellement à l’épreuve\r\nque par la Commune, pour brûler nos palais.”[106]\r\n\r\nWhen the Crusades began in 1097 Greeks were thus in possession of\r\ntwo species of incendiaries: the sea-fire which was distinctively\r\nand exclusively Greek, and the old mixture of the Æneas family which\r\nwas known all over the East. Yet it was to the latter that the name\r\n“Greek fire” was given by the Crusaders, who, I believe, had neither\r\nexperience nor knowledge of the sea-fire. The only passage I can recall\r\namong the old writers in which the two fires are discriminated and\r\ncorrectly named occurs in the metrical romance “Richard Coer-de-Lion,”\r\n_temp._ Edward I. (1272-1307):—\r\n\r\n  “Kyng Richard, oute of hys galye,\r\n  Caste wylde-fyr into the skye\r\n  And fyr Gregeys into the see.\r\n\r\n  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  The see brent all off fyr Gregeys” (2627).[107]\r\n\r\nHistorically this passage is probably worthless; but, whether\r\ndeliberately or by accident, the poet indicates the real distinction\r\nbetween the two fires. It was the sea-fire, the true Greek fire,\r\nwhich was thrown or fell into the sea; while the wild-fire, misnamed\r\n“Greek fire” by the Crusaders, was flung “into the sky” to descend\r\non the heads of the enemy. In the preceding pages I have adopted the\r\nCrusaders’ nomenclature, because it is now too late to rectify their\r\nblunder.\r\n\r\nDuring the siege of Stirling Castle, 1304, Edward I. “gave orders\r\nfor the employment of Greek fire, with which he had probably become\r\nacquainted in the East.”[108] It was also made use of by the Flemish\r\nengineer, Crab, who took an active part in the defence of Berwick when\r\nbesieged by Edward II. in 1319:—\r\n\r\n “And pyk (_pitch_) and ter (_tar_) als haiff thai tane,\r\n  And lynt (_fat_) and herdes (_refuse of flax_) and brymstane,\r\n  And dry treyis (_trees or wood_) that wele wald brin (_burn_).”[109]\r\n\r\nWe again made use of Greek fire in the defence of the Castle of\r\nBreteuil, and in the attack on the Castle of Romorentin, in 1356;[110]\r\nbut no record remains of its composition or of the way in which it was\r\nprojected. It was no doubt similar to Whitehorne’s wild-fire of 1560,\r\ngiven in Table II. As late as 1571 Greek fire was poured down on the\r\nheads of the Turks, in the primitive fashion, by the Venetians in the\r\ndefence of Famagusta.[111]\r\n\r\nThe phrase “Greek fire” never took root in England, where “wild-fire”\r\nwas early substituted for it. Wild-fire is found in Robert of\r\nGloucester’s “Chronicle,”[112] of the same date as “Richard\r\nCoer-de-Lion.” According to the _Promptorium Parvulorum_, an\r\nEnglish-Latin dictionary compiled in 1440 by Galfridus, a Dominican\r\nof Lynn Episcopi in Norfolk, the phrases “Greek fire” and “wild-fire”\r\nwere then synonymous; for he gives as the Latin equivalents of the\r\nlatter—“ignis Pelasgus, vel ignis pelagus, vel ignis Græcus.” Among\r\nthe ammunition supplied to the troops sent to Scotland under Lord\r\nLennox in 1545, we find “xx tronckes charged with wylde fyer.”[113]\r\nWhitehorne gives a plate of these tronckes or trombes, which were\r\nhollow wooden cylinders, “as bigge as a man’s thigh and the length of\r\nan ell,” filled with the mixture given in Table II. for the sixteenth\r\ncentury. In Phillips’ English Dictionary, 1706, wild-fire is described\r\nas (1) “a sort of fire invented by the Grecians about A.C. 777,” and\r\n(2) “gunpowder rolled up wet and set on fire.” It is used in the latter\r\nsense in “Robinson Crusoe,” published in 1719. Before an attack on\r\nthe Indians, the sailors “made some wild-fire ... by wetting a little\r\npowder in the palms of their hands” (Part ii. chap. 21). The word is\r\nonly heard now in the phrase “spreads like wildfire.”\r\n\r\nBut though its names have passed away, the thing remains. Greek fire\r\nwas used at the siege of Charleston in 1863; in 1870 M. Berthelot\r\nwatched its effects when thrown into Paris by German guns; we\r\nourselves possess it to this day in our Carcass composition.[114]\r\nThe sea-fire, on the other hand, was comparatively short-lived, and\r\nI can find no certain evidence of its employment after the year\r\n1200. Its disappearance is easily accounted for. From about the\r\nmiddle of the eleventh century the Byzantines began to show signs of\r\nan ever-increasing disinclination for war-service either afloat or\r\nashore,[115] a want of national honour and military energy which Mr.\r\nFinlay ascribes to “a general deficiency of common honesty and personal\r\ncourage;”[116] and this moral degeneracy threw naval duties more and\r\nmore into the hands of the Venetians and other foreign mercenaries,\r\nto whom the Government may have been unwilling to make known the\r\nsecret of the sea-fire. This state of things did not escape the notice\r\nof Benjamin of Tudela, a Jewish traveller of the twelfth century:\r\n“(Les Grecs) entretiennent des soldats à gages de toutes les Nations\r\nqu’ils appellent Barbares, pour faire la guerre au Roi des Peuples\r\nde Togarma appellez Turcs. Car les Grecs eux-mêmes n’ont ni cœur ni\r\ncourage pour la guerre. Aussi sont-ils reputez comme les femmes qui\r\nn’ont aucune force pour combattre.”[117] Matters came to a crisis in\r\n1200: in this year Michael Struphnos, the admiral commanding, sold the\r\nnaval stores at Constantinople and appropriated the proceeds of the\r\nsale.[118] When, therefore, the pious warriors of the Fourth Crusade\r\nturned their arms against their fellow-Christians and beleaguered the\r\ncity in April 1204, there was no sea-fire at hand for use against\r\ntheir ships, and an attempt to burn them by means of sixteen ordinary\r\nfire-ships was foiled by the activity of the Venetian sailors.[119]\r\nThe accession of the Latin dynasty to the throne of Constantinople in\r\nthis year was a serious hindrance to the reemployment of sea-fire.\r\nThe Latins were ignorant of its composition, and they were not likely\r\nto gain information upon the subject from the few Greeks who were\r\nacquainted with it; for these Christians did not love one another.\r\nFinally, saltpetre was discovered not many years afterwards, and\r\nits substitution for customary ingredients in the later editions of\r\nexisting “Fire-books”[120] proves that it was utilised without delay\r\nfor Greek fire, which thus became a more formidable incendiary than\r\nsea-fire.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks had no hand in the invention of cannon. One of their\r\nhistorians of the fifteenth century, when speculating on the subject\r\nin his narrative for the year 1389, says the Germans were commonly\r\nbelieved to have been the inventors.[121] Could the Greeks, then, have\r\nbeen in possession of saltpetre-mixtures many centuries before? Is it\r\ncredible that people with intellect as keen as the Greeks employed\r\nan explosive for long ages without hitting upon the idea of metal\r\nguns? Yet judging from the manner in which Chalcocondyles speaks of\r\ncannon in his narrative for 1446, they were even then but little known\r\nto the Greeks. “Cannon,” he tells his countrymen, “are formidable\r\ninstruments, which no armour can resist, and which penetrates through\r\neverything.”[122] No historian of the ability of Chalcocondyles would\r\nhave spoken in this manner about an arm which was well known.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the first recorded use of fire-arrows on Greek soil\r\nwas made by Persian archers,[123] lends some probability to the\r\nview that Greek fire was originally borrowed from the East; but the\r\nGreeks assuredly invented the sea-fire which was the palladium of the\r\nEmpire for several centuries. To the discovery of saltpetre they have\r\nno legitimate claim. The claim put forward in their name is based\r\npartly on a metaphor,[124] partly on the assumption that the effects\r\nof sea-fire could have been only produced by a mixture containing\r\nsaltpetre; and it cannot be sustained. The hypothesis that Kallinikos\r\ncompounded a saltpetre mixture ignores the highly probable conclusion\r\nthat saltpetre was not discovered until the thirteenth century;[125]\r\nfails to explain some statements, and is irreconcilable with other\r\nstatements made by the ancients; and involves many incredible\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\nIt may be objected that this conclusion has been arrived at without\r\ntaking the evidence of the chief witness for the Greeks, Marcus Græcus.\r\nLet us examine his _Liber Ignium_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nMARCUS GRÆCUS\r\n\r\n(_Du Theil’s text_[126] _with Berthelot’s numeration_)\r\n\r\n  Incipit Liber Ignium a Marco Græco descriptus, cuius\r\n  virtus et efficacia ad comburendos hostes tam in mari\r\n  quam in terra plurimum efficax reperitur; quorum primus\r\n  hic est.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

Tunc vero oleum sub veru et super lignum distillans\r\naccensum super aquas discurret, et quidquid obviam fuerit concremabit.\r\n\r\n2. Et sequitur alia species ignis quæ comburit domos inimicorum in\r\nmontibus sitas, aut in aliis locis, si libet. Recipe balsami sive\r\npetrolii libram I., medulæ cannæ ferulæ libras sex, sulphuris libram\r\nI., pinguedinis arietinæ liquefactæ libram I., et oleum terebenthinæ\r\nsive de lateribus vel anethorum.

Igne autem intus\r\nreposito, in aërem cum arcu emittes; ibi enim sepo liquefacto et\r\nconfectione succensa, quocumque loco cecidit, comburit illum; et si\r\naqua superjecta fuerit, augmentabitur flamma ignis.\r\n\r\n3. Alius modus ignis ad comburendos hostes ubique sitos. Recipe\r\nbalsamum, oleum Æthiopiæ, alkitran et oleum sulphuris. Haec quidem\r\nomnia in vase fictili reposita in fimo diebus XIV. subfodias.

Vesica tali præscripta sæpissime oleo peruncta cum\r\nligno marubii, quod ad haec invenietur aptius, accenso ac simul\r\nimposito, foramen aperies; ea enim semel accensa et a filtro quo\r\ninvoluta fuerit extracta, in ventosa nocti sub lecto vel tecto inimici\r\ntui supponatur. Quocumque enim ventus eam sufflaverit, quidquid\r\npropinquum fuerit, comburetur; et si aqua projecta fuerit, letales\r\nprocreabit flammas.\r\n\r\n7.Sub pacis namque specie missis nuntiis, ad loca hostilia bacleos\r\ngerentes excavos hac materia repletos et confectione, qui jam prope\r\nhostes fuerint, quo fungebuntur ignem jam per domos et vias fundentes.\r\nDum calor solis supervenerit, omnia incendio comburentur.[127]\r\n\r\nRecipe sandaracae (libram, cerae)[128] libram: in vase vero fictili,\r\nore concluso, liquescat.

Ignis quem invenit Aristoteles quum cum Alexandro ad obscura\r\nloca iter ageret, volens in eo per mensem fieri id quod sol in anno\r\npræparat.

Ipsam eodem igne perunctam X. diebus siccabis, duodecies\r\niterando: per annum namque integrum ignis idem succensus nullatenus\r\ndeficiet. Quæ enim inunctio ultra annum durabit. Si vero locum quempiam\r\ninunguere libeat, eo desiccato, scintilla quælibet diffusa ardebit\r\ncontinue, nec aqua extingui poterit. Et haec est prædicti ignis\r\ncompositio. Recipe alkitran, colophonii, sulphuris crocei, olei ovorum\r\nsulphurici. Sulphur in marmore teratur. Quo facto universum oleum\r\nsuperponas. Deinde tectoris limaginem ad omne pondus acceptum insimul\r\npista et inungue.\r\n\r\n9. Et sequitur alia species ignis, quo Aristoteles domos in montibus\r\nsitas destruere incendio ait, ut et mons ipse subsideret. Recipe\r\nbalsami libram I., alkitran libras V., oleum ovorum et calcis non\r\nextinctae libras X. Calcem teras cum oleo donec una fiat massa; deinde\r\ninunguas lapides ex ipso et herbas ac renascentias quaslibet in diebus\r\ncanicularibus, et sub fimo eiusdam regionis sub fossa dimittes;\r\npostea[129] namque autumnalis pluviæ dilapsu succenditur. Terram et\r\nindigenas comburit igne Aristoteles, namque hunc ignem annis IX. durare\r\nasserit.\r\n\r\n10. Compositio inextinguibilis et experta. Accipe[130] sulphur vivum,\r\ncolophonium, asphaltum classam, tartarum, piculam navalem, fimum ovinum\r\naut columbinum. Hæc pulverisa subtiliter petroleo; postea in ampulla\r\nreponendo vitrea, orificio bene clauso, per dies XV. in fimo calido\r\nequino subhumetur, Extracta vero ampulla destillabis oleum in cucurbita\r\nlento igne ac cinere mediante, calidissima ac subtili. In quo si bombax\r\nintincta fuerit ac accensa, omnia super quæ arcu vel ballista proiecta\r\nfuerit, incendio concremabit.\r\n\r\n11. Nota quod omnis ignis inextinguibilis IV. rebus extingui vel\r\nsuffocari poterit, videlicet cum aceto acuto aut cum urina antiqua vel\r\narena, sive filtro ter in aceto imbibito et toties desiccato ignem iam\r\ndictum suffocas.\r\n\r\n12. Nota quod ignis volatilis in aëre duplex est compositio; quorum\r\nprimus est:—recipe partem unam colophonii et tantum sulphuris vivi,\r\nII. partes vero salis petrosi et in oleo linoso vel lamii[131] quod est\r\nmelius, dissolvantur bene pulverisata et oleo liquefacta. Postea in\r\ncanna vel ligno excavo reponatur et accendatur. Evolat enim subito ad\r\nquemcumque locum volueris, et omnia incendio concremabit.\r\n\r\n13. Secundus modus ignis volatilis hoc modo conficitur. Accipias libram\r\nI. sulphuris vivi, libras duas carbonum vitis vel salicis, VI. libras\r\nsalis petrosi; quae tria subtilissima terantur in lapide marmoreo.\r\nPostea pulvis ad libitum in tunica reponatur volatili vel tonitrum\r\nfaciente.\r\n\r\nNota, quod tunica ad volundum debet esse gracilis et longa et cum\r\nprædicto pulvere optime conculcato repleta. Tunica vero tonitrum\r\nfaciens debet esse brevis et grossa et prædicto pulvere semiplena et ab\r\nutraque parte fortissime filo ferreo bene ligata. Nota, quod in tali\r\ntunica parvum foramen faciendum est, ut tenta imposita accendatur; quæ\r\ntenta in extremitatibus sit gracilis, in medio vero lata et prædicto\r\npulvere repleta. Nota, quod quæ ad volandum tunica, plicaturas ad\r\nlibitum habere potest; tonitrum vero faciens, quam plurimas plicaturas.\r\nNota, quod duplex poteris facere tonitrum atque duplex volatile\r\ninstrumentum, videlicet tunicam includendo.\r\n\r\n14. Nota, quod sal petrosum est minera terræ et reperitur in scopulis\r\net lapidibus.[132] Haec terra dissolvatur in aqua bulliente, postea\r\ndepurata et destillata per filtrum, permittatur per diem et noctem\r\nintegram decoqui; et invenies in fundo laminas salis congelatas\r\ncristallinas.\r\n\r\n15. Candela quæ, si semel accensa fuerit, non amplius extinguitur. Si\r\nvero aqua irrigata fuerit, maius parabit incendium. Formetur sphaera de\r\nære Italico; deinde accipies calcis vivæ partem unam, galbani mediam\r\net cum felle testudinis ad pondus galbani sumpto conficies. Postea\r\ncantharides quot volueris accipies, capitibus et alis abscisis, cum\r\naequali parte olei zambac, teras et in vase fictili reposita, XI.\r\ndiebus sub fimo equino reponantur, de quinto in quintum diem fimum\r\nrenovando. Sic olei foetidi et crocei spiritum assument, de quo sphæram\r\nillinias; qua siccata, sepo inguatur, post igne accendatur.\r\n\r\n16. Alia candela que continuum præstat incendium. Vermes noctilucas\r\ncum oleo zambac puro teres et in rotunda ponas vitrea, orificio\r\nlutato cera Græca et sale combusto bene recluso et in fimo, ut iam\r\ndictum est, equino reponenda. Quo soluto, sphæram de ferro Indico vel\r\nauricalco undique cum penna illinias; quæ his iuncta et dessiccata igne\r\nsuccendatur et nunquam deficiet. Si vero attingit pluvia, majus præstat\r\nincendii incrementum.\r\n\r\n17. Alia quæ semel incensa dat lumen diuturnum. Recipe noctilucas\r\nquum incipiunt volare, et cum æquali parte olei zambac commixta, XIV.\r\ndiebus sub fimo fodias equino. Quo inde extracto, ad quartam partem\r\nistius assumas felles testudinis, ad sex felles mustelæ, ad medietatem\r\nfellis furonis. In fimo repone, ut iam dictum est. Deinde exhibe in\r\nquolibet vase lichnum, cujuscumque generis, pone de ligno aut latone\r\nvel ferro vel ære. Ea tandem hoc oleo peruncta et accensa diuturnum\r\npræstat incendium. Haec autem opera prodigiosa et admiranda Hermes et\r\nTholomeus[133] asserunt.\r\n\r\n18. Hoc autem genus candelæ neque in domo clausa nec aperta neque in\r\naqua extingui poterit. Quod est: recipe fel testudinis, fel marini\r\nleporis sive lupi aquatici de cuius felle Tyriaca. Quibus insimul\r\ncollectis quadrupliciter noctilucarum capitibus ac alis præcisis\r\nadicies, totumque in vase plumbeo vel vitreo repositum in fimo\r\nsubfodias equino, ut dictum est, quod extractum oleum recipias. Verum\r\ntum cum æquali parte prædictorum fellium et æquali noctilucarum\r\nadmiscens, sub fimo XI. diebus subfodias per singulares hebdomades\r\nfimum renovando; quo iam extracto de radice herbæ que cyrogaleonis[134]\r\net noctilucis pabulum factum, ex hoc liquore medium superfundas. Quod\r\nsi volueris, omnia repone in vase vitreo et eodem ordine fit. Quolibet\r\nenim loco repositum fuerit, continuum præstat incendium.\r\n\r\n19. Candela quæ in domo relucet ut argentum. Recipe lacertam nigram\r\nvel viridem, cuius caudam amputa et desicca; nam in cauda eius argenti\r\nvivi silicem reperies. Deinde quodcumque lichnum in illo illinitum ac\r\ninvolutum in lampade locabis vitrea aut ferrea, qua accensa mox domus\r\nargenteum induet colorem, et quicumque in domo illa erit, ad modum\r\nargenti relucebit.\r\n\r\n20. Ut domus quælibet viridem induat colorem et aviculæ coloris\r\nejusdem volent. Recipe cerebrum aviculæ in panno involvens tentam et\r\nbaculum, inde faciens vel pabulum in lampade viridi novo oleo olivarum\r\naccendatur.\r\n\r\n21. Ut ignem manibus gestare possis sine ulla læsione. Cum aqua fabarum\r\ncalida calx dissolvatur, modicum terræ Messinæ, postea parum malvæ\r\nvisci adicies. Quibus insimul commixtis palmam illinias et desiccari\r\npermittas.\r\n\r\n22. Ut aliquis sine læsione comburi videatur. Alceam cum albumine\r\novorum confice, et corpus perungue et desiccari permitte. Deinde coque\r\ncum vitellis ovorum iterum, commiscens terendo super pannum lineum.\r\nPostea sulphur pulverisatum superaspergens accende.\r\n\r\n23. Candela quæ, quum aliquis in manibus apertis tenuerit, cito\r\nextinguitur; si vero clausis, ignis subito renitebitur: et haec\r\nmillies, si vis, poteris facere. Recipe nucem Indicam vel castaneam,\r\neam aqua camphoræ conficias, et manus cum eo inungue, et fiet confestim.\r\n\r\n24. Confectio visci est cum si aqua projecta fuerit, accendetur ex\r\ntoto. Recipe calcem vivam, eamque cum modico gummi Arabici et oleo in\r\nvase candido cum sulphure confice; ex quo factum viscum et aqua aspersa\r\naccendetur. Hac vero confectione domus quælibet adveniente pluvia\r\naccendetur.\r\n\r\n25. Lapis qui dicitur petra solis in domo locandus, et appositus\r\nlapidi qui dicitur albacarimum (_alba ceraunia?_). Lapis quidem niger\r\nest et rotundus, candidas vero habens notas, ex quo vero lux solaris\r\nserenissimus procedit radius. Quem si in domo dimiseris, non minor quam\r\nex candelis cereis splendor procedit. Hic in loco sublimi positus et\r\naqua compositus relucet valde.\r\n\r\n26. Ignem Græcum tali modo facies. Recipe sulphur vivum, tartarum,\r\nsarcocollam et picem, sal coctum, oleum petroleum et oleum gemmæ.\r\nFacias bullire invicem omnia ista bene. Postea impone stuppam et\r\naccende, quod, si volueris, exhibere (poteris ?) per embotum ut supra\r\ndiximus.[135] Stuppa illinita non extinguetur, nisi urina vel aceto vel\r\narena.\r\n\r\n27. Aquam ardentem sic facies. Recipe vinum nigrum spissum et vetus\r\net in una quarta ipsius distemperabuntur unciæ II. sulphuris vivi\r\nsubtilissime pulverisati, lib. II. tartari extracti a bono vino albo,\r\nunciæ II. salis communis; et subdita ponas in cucurbita bene plumbata\r\net alembico supposito destillabis aquam ardentem quam servare debes in\r\nvase clauso vitreo.\r\n\r\n28. Experimentum mirabile quod fecit homines ire in igne sini læsione\r\nvel etiam portare ignem vel ferrum calidum in manu.

Berthelot (i. 100 _ff._) gives the best existing text of the\r\nforegoing tract, founded on Paris MSS. 7156 and 7158 collated with the\r\nMunich MS. 267. He adds extracts from the Munich MS. 197, dated 1438.\r\nHerr von Romocki gives the text reproduced here and the Nürnberg MS. of\r\na somewhat later date than the Paris MSS., say 1350.[137]\r\n\r\nA glance at the text given here shows that, far from being a formal\r\nand connected treatise, it is a medley of recipes thrown together with\r\nvery little method and without any literary skill. Of the thirty-five\r\nrecipes (in Du Theil’s MS.) fourteen are war mixtures, six relate to\r\nthe extinction of incendiaries or the prevention and cure of burns,\r\neleven are for lamps, lights, &c., and four describe the preparation\r\nof certain chemicals—one of them, No. 14, giving a mode of refining\r\nsaltpetre. The war mixtures consist of nine recipes for various fires,\r\nNos. 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 24, and 26; one for fire-arrow composition,\r\nNo. 10; and four for rockets and Roman candles (including a “cracker”),\r\nNos. 12, 13, 32, and 33. Nos. 9, 15, and 24 contain quicklime; 12, 13,\r\n14, 32, and 33 contain saltpetre.\r\n\r\nA closer examination leads to the conclusion that the tract is the work\r\nof neither one author nor one period. As we read of such ingredients\r\nas weasel’s gall (17) and paste of glow-worms (16); of the mercury to\r\nbe found in black and green lizards’ tails (19); of the mixture which\r\nignites incontinently at sunrise, wherewith crows are to be anointed\r\nand despatched against the enemy (3), we seem to hear the chant of the\r\nwitches in “Macbeth”:—\r\n\r\n  “Eye of newt and toe of frog,\r\n  Wool of bat and tongue of dog,\r\n  Adder’s fork and blind-worm’s sting,\r\n  Lizard’s leg and owlet’s wing.”\r\n\r\nThese recipes embody the same traditions as the war recipes of the\r\n“Kestoi” of Sextus Julius Africanus, which belong to the seventh\r\ncentury. But on turning to Nos. 32 and 33, we find recipes as precise\r\nand formal as those of Hassan er-Rammah, who wrote in the last\r\nquarter of the thirteenth century. The description of the rocket\r\nand its composition (13) is as definite and intelligible as many\r\na recipe of the seventeenth century: recipes 8 and 17, with their\r\nallusions to Hermes, the mythical Alexander the Great, Aristotle the\r\nwizard and Ptolemy the magician, belong to a far earlier period. In\r\nshort, the extraordinary contrast in style and matter, phraseology\r\nand diction, between certain recipes and others, leads irresistibly\r\nto the conclusion that the oldest recipes are separated from the\r\nyoungest by several centuries, and that the tract (as we possess it)\r\nwas not the work of one man, but of several. There is a kernel of old\r\nrecipes, to which others were added from time to time. This conclusion\r\nreceives strong support from the fact that no two of the MSS. are of\r\nthe same length. The Munich MS. contains twenty-two, Berthelot’s text\r\nthirty-five, and the Nürnberg MS. twenty-five recipes.\r\n\r\nThe best judges date the oldest existing MSS., Paris, 7156 and 7158, at\r\nabout 1300 A.D., and Abd Allah tells us that saltpetre was known to the\r\nSpanish Arabs in the second quarter of the thirteenth century.[138] The\r\nsaltpetre recipes, therefore, 12, 13, 14, 32, 33, lie between the years\r\n1225 and 1300. We shall call them, for convenience of reference, the\r\n“Late Recipes.”\r\n\r\nNo one who carefully studies the remaining recipes can fail to observe\r\nthat many of them are marked by archaism of style, form and matter, and\r\nthat they hand down to us ancient alchemical traditions, or traces of\r\nthem; while others display no such peculiarities. Let us then, again\r\nfor mere convenience, divide them into two series—the “Early Recipes,”\r\nwhich possess these peculiarities, and the “Middle Recipes,” which do\r\nnot. To what periods do these two series belong?\r\n\r\nNo. 26, apparently the most modern of the Middle Recipes, will\r\npresently be shown to belong to the early part of the thirteenth\r\ncentury, and, as it does not contain saltpetre, its approximate date\r\nis 1200-1225. There is no evidence, so far as I am aware, which would\r\nenable us to fix the beginning of the Middle or the end of the Early\r\nRecipes. The matter, happily, is immaterial; it is sufficient for us to\r\nknow that the former series is undoubtedly subsequent to the latter,\r\nand (as will be shown) quite independent of it.\r\n\r\nFor a reason which will appear presently, the date of the oldest of the\r\nEarly Recipes depends upon the period at which Moslems began to write\r\nupon alchemy. According to Arab authorities,[139] the first Moslem who\r\nwrote on the subject was Prince Khalid ibn Yazeed ibn Moawyah, who died\r\nin 708. After him came the real Jabir, of the eighth or ninth century;\r\nbut Masudi, in the tenth century, tells us that there were many other\r\nwriters on alchemy whose names are now lost.[140] The very earliest\r\ndate, then, that can be assigned to the oldest of the Early Recipes is\r\nthe eighth century, say 750.\r\n\r\nThe three series are as follows:—\r\n\r\n  +-------------------------+-------------------+-----------------+\r\n  |     Early Recipes,      | Middle Recipes,   |  Late Recipes,  |\r\n  |         750-  ?         |    ?  -1225.      |   1225-1300.    |\r\n  |                         |                   |                 |\r\n  +-------------------------+-------------------+-----------------+\r\n  | 1, 2, 3 6, 7, 8, 9, 1O, | 4, 5, 11, 22, 24, | 12, 13, 14, 32, |\r\n  | 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, | 26, 27, 28, 29,   | 33              |\r\n  | 21, 23, 25, 34          | 30, 31, 35        |                 |\r\n  +-------------------------+-------------------+-----------------+\r\n\r\nLooking from the chemical point of view, M. Berthelot divides the\r\nrecipes into six groups.[141] Those who are interested in the matter\r\nwill find on examination that, chronologically, his groups harmonise\r\nperfectly with the three series given here.\r\n\r\nThe reader will observe on a cursory examination of the Latin text that\r\nmost of the recipes contain foreign, _i.e._ non-Latin words; and this\r\nfact suggests the question, Is the _Liber Ignium_ an original work or a\r\ntranslation?\r\n\r\nThe number of foreign words and allusions is so considerable as to\r\nleave little doubt that a large part of the tract was translated from\r\nsome foreign language, and no one, I believe, seriously maintains that\r\nthe work, as a whole, is original. From what language, then, has it\r\nbeen translated?\r\n\r\nWe meet with the Greek proper names Hermes, Ptolemy, Alexander and\r\nAristotle, and with a number of Greek words which look like survivals\r\nof a Greek original. Among the most prominent are alba ceraunia (?),\r\nasphaltum,[142] bombax, cynoglossum (?), orichalcum and sarcocolla,\r\nall of which are latinised Greek words. But on looking closely into\r\nthis evidence we find that it has very little weight. The Greek proper\r\nnames prove nothing. Hermes and Ptolemy became common property to\r\nalchemists of all nationalities in the infancy of alchemy. Alexander\r\nthe Great’s extraordinary career excited universal wonder, and the many\r\nand marvellous legends which grew round his name in the West were only\r\nsurpassed by those of the East. He and his Wazir, Aristu (Aristotle),\r\nwere common property long before the _Liber Ignium_ saw the light.\r\nThe Greek words give no support to the hypothesis of a Greek original\r\nunless it can be shown either that they had not previously been adopted\r\nby the Latins, or that the tract was written before they were borrowed.\r\nA particular instance will make the matter clearer. We took the word\r\n_harquebus_ from the French at some period, say _p_. If harquebus\r\noccurs in an English book written after _p_, its presence raises no\r\npresumption that the book was in any way connected with France, or\r\neven that its author understood French. If the book was written before\r\n_p_, its author must have had recourse, directly or indirectly, to\r\nFrench sources. Now all the Greek words given above had been latinised\r\nlong before the _Liber Ignium_ was written, and might have been used by\r\na Latin when translating from any language. Alba ceraunia, asphaltum,\r\nbombax, cynoglossum and sarcocolla are found in Pliny’s “Natural\r\nHistory,” first century A.D., and orichalcum occurs in the “Bragging\r\nSoldier” of Plautus about the end of the third century B.C. But it is\r\nunnecessary to continue the examination of the Greek words contained\r\nin the tract for the following reason. A hypothesis must cover all the\r\nfacts of a case, and some facts in the present case are inexplicable on\r\nthe theory of a Greek original.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks had three words for the asphalt family, _pissa_,\r\n_asphaltos_, and _naphtha_; and the translator had at least three Latin\r\nwords (which he has actually used) wherewith to translate them, _pix_\r\n(or _picula_), _asphaltum_, and _petroleum_. How, then, came he to use\r\nthe barbarism, _alkitran Græcum_, in recipe 1? The original of this\r\nphrase came from no Greek source.\r\n\r\nWe could not expect the author of the tract to reveal the secret of the\r\nsea-fire, which was only known to a few officials; but the mediæval\r\nGreeks were not an exceptionally modest people, and we naturally\r\nlook for some slight allusion to this triumphant incendiary and the\r\nsiphons in which it was employed. They are never referred to, although\r\nballistæ, bows, and rockets are mentioned in recipes 10, 12, 13, 32, 33.\r\n\r\nThe title of the tract, _Liber Ignium, a Marco Græco descriptus_,\r\nassuming it to have been correctly and literally translated, was not\r\nwritten by a Byzantine Greek. No Byzantine Greek ever described himself\r\n(or a compatriot) as a Greek: “in the lowest period of degeneracy and\r\ndecay the name of _Roman_ adhered to the last fragments of the Empire\r\nof Constantinople.”[143] The writer of the title, therefore, was either\r\na Moslem or a western.\r\n\r\nThe author of recipe 26, _Ignem Græcum_, &c., was neither a Greek nor\r\na Moslem. No Greek[144] or Moslem[145] writer ever uses the phrase\r\n“Greek fire,” which sprang up in the West during the Crusades.[146]\r\nThe recipe, therefore, cannot have been written before the siege of\r\nNice, 1097, the first act of the first crusade, and it was probably\r\nnot written until long afterwards. The phrase “Greek fire” must have\r\ntaken some time to reach the West, and it spread there very slowly.\r\nAbbé Guibert de Nogent, who died in 1124, speaks of “discharging\r\nfrom machines the fire they call Greek” (_Græcos, quos ita vocitant,\r\nIgnes injicere machinis_).[147] At the close of the century William\r\nthe Little, Canon of St. Mary’s, Newburgh, Yorkshire, mentions “a\r\ncertain kind of fire which they call Greek “ (_quodam ignis genere\r\nquem_ _Græcum dicunt_)[148] Such modes of expression show that Greek\r\nfire was very little known in the West during the twelfth century.\r\nIn the _Liber Ignium_, on the other hand, it is spoken of without\r\nqualification or explanation, like sulphur or pitch, as a substance\r\ntoo well known to require note or comment. The 26th recipe, therefore,\r\nbelongs very probably to the first quarter of the thirteenth century,\r\nand its author was certainly a western.\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis of a Greek original, then, must be abandoned, even\r\nthough old Greek alchemical traditions are crystallised in the Early\r\nRecipes. The Greeks founded alchemy in remote times; their methods were\r\ntransmitted through the Syrians and Egyptian Greeks to the Moslems;\r\nand a large number of their recipes had become common property long\r\nbefore the _Liber Ignium_ was written. But Greek science did not spread\r\nequally in all directions, at least to any appreciable extent. It\r\nspread to the south and east only, and the west owed its knowledge of\r\nalchemy to the Arabs who invaded Spain in 710 A.D. This fact may throw\r\nsome light upon the Arabic words and allusions to be found in the tract.\r\n\r\nIn a very old recipe, No. 9, we meet with the phrase, “the first fall\r\nof the autumnal rain “ (_primo autumnalis pluviae dilapsu_), which\r\nindicates the regular, periodic rains of the East, and is apparently\r\nthe translation of خريف (kharif) = the autumnal rains. The beginning\r\nof these rains was an event of great importance to the Arabs. “Suivant\r\nMasudi,” says Baron de Sacy, “les Arabes nomment l’automne وسمي\r\n(_wasmy_), à cause des pluies qui tombent en cette saison, parceque\r\nla terre, étant alors très-sèche, et n’ayant pas été humectée depuis\r\nlongtemps, la première pluie qui vient à tomber imprime sa marque sur\r\nla terre.... Il ajoute que les Arabes commencent l’année à l’équinoxe\r\nd’automne, parceque c’est l’époque où commence à tomber la pluie à\r\nlaquelle ils doivent leur subsistance.”[149]\r\n\r\n_Alambicum_ is apparently the latinised form of the Spanish\r\n_alambique_, which is simply the Arabic الانبيق (_al-ambiq_)—whatever\r\nthe derivation of the Arabic word may be.\r\n\r\nاسترلاب (_Asturlab_), although found in Masudi[150] and the “Arabian\r\nNights,”[151] is not a genuine Arab word. It was borrowed from some\r\nother language by the Arabs, who possessed few or no scientific words\r\nof their own. The “Nihayet al-Adab” tells us (in Lane’s “Arabic\r\nDictionary,” under _asturlab_) that the names of all instruments by\r\nwhich time is known, whether by means of calculation or water or\r\nsand, are foreign to the Arabic language. In most Arabic dictionaries\r\n_asturlab_ is derived from the Greek ἀστρολάβος, a word which appears\r\nto go back no further than the second century B.C., when it was\r\nemployed by the Egyptian astronomer, Ptolemy. But it was long suspected\r\nthat the instrument was of eastern origin,[152] and all doubt about\r\nthe matter was at length set at rest by Mr. George Smith’s discovery,\r\nin the palace of Sennacherib at Nineveh, of the fragment of an\r\nastrolabe,[153] which cannot be dated later than the eighth century\r\nB.C. Now the earliest recorded astronomical observation made by the\r\nGreeks was the determination of the summer solstice by Meton, 430\r\nB.C.[154] For the name of this fragment, therefore, we must look to the\r\nlanguage of the country of its birth; and there we find the Persian\r\n_asturlab_, which is apparently formed from the primitive verbal root\r\n_labh_ = taking,[155] and the Persian _astar_ or _sitára_ = Pehlevi,\r\n_çtârak_ = Zend, _çtare_ = Sanskrit, _star_ = our own _star_. The Arabs\r\nmost probably took their _asturlab_, with so many other words, from\r\nthe Persian. The Greeks who followed Alexander the Great into Persia\r\nfound there much that was new to them. They saw for the first time\r\n“the cotton tree and the fine tissues and paper for which it furnished\r\nthe materials.”[156] They handled the wool of the great Bombax tree.\r\nThey found naphtha, of whose properties Alexander was entirely\r\nignorant.[157] They obtained drugs and gums of which they knew\r\nnothing. The philosopher Kallisthenes discovered in Babylon Chaldæan\r\nastronomical observations extending back to 721 B.C.;[158] was shown,\r\nwe cannot doubt, the instrument with which they were made; and probably\r\nheard for the first time the word _asturlab_ or _usturlab_.\r\n\r\nFor copper (or some alloy of it[159]) the _cyprium_ of Pliny (which\r\nbecame _cuprum_ about the end of the third century A.D.) is ignored in\r\nthe tract, and the metal is called _æs rubicundus_. This phrase may\r\npossibly represent the χαλκὸς ἐρυθρός of Homer (Il. ix. 365); but it is\r\nfar more probably the literal translation of the Arabic phrase used to\r\nthis day for copper نحاس احمر (_nuhas ahmar_) = red brass.\r\n\r\nFour (so-called) sulphurs are mentioned by both Pliny and the writers\r\nof the _Liber Ignium_, but their names are identical in only one\r\ncase, _sulphur vivum_. Two sulphurs are named in the tract from their\r\ncolour, after the oriental fashion, _sulphur splendidum_ and _sulphur\r\ncroceum_. Masudi speaks in the tenth century of “white, yellow,\r\nand other kinds of sulphur,”[160] and “white and red sulphur” are\r\nmentioned in the _Ayin Acberi_, a Persian MS. quoted by the Baron de\r\nSacy.[161] Several sulphurs, all named from their colour, are given in\r\nthe _Liber Secretorum_, translated from the Arabic or Persian, _cir._\r\n1000 A.D.,[162] and similar sulphurs are found in the Syriac treatise\r\nreproduced by M. Berthelot, ii. 159-60. Finally, the Hindus had four\r\nsulphurs, white, red, yellow, and black.[163]\r\n\r\nThe Arabs had no special word for bitumen: _bitumen_ is not to be found\r\nin the tract.\r\n\r\n_Alkitran_, the Spanish _alquitran_, which is used five times, is pure\r\nArabic, القطران (_al-qitran_).\r\n\r\nIn three successive recipes we meet an Arabic word in its native form,\r\nwithout any attempt to translate it—زنبق (_zembaq_). Its meaning is\r\ndoubtful, for a reason given by Baron de Sacy: “Le nom zambak est\r\ncommun à plusieurs plantes. Forskål le donne à _l’iris_ et au _lis\r\nblanc_.”[164]\r\n\r\nWe have already met with two Arabic words which were adopted unchanged,\r\nand are still used, by the Spaniards, alembic and alkitran. There are\r\nother traces of Spain.\r\n\r\nRoger Bacon observes in his “Greek Grammar” (p. 92) that the alloy\r\n_auricalcum_ is in no way connected with _aurum_, gold, but is a\r\ncorruption of _orichalcum_. The Spaniards, however, retained in their\r\nlanguage the corrupt form auricalco, and auricalcum occurs twice in the\r\ntract.\r\n\r\nWe may gather from Lebrixa’s explanation of “bitumen Judaicum”—“est\r\nquod græce dicitur asphaltos”[165]—that the Spaniards had no special\r\nword for asphalt; _asphaltum_ is used only once in the tract, recipe\r\n10. But they used _petroleo_ for petroleum;[166] _petroleum_ is found\r\nin recipes 2, 10, and 26. This word, in the form _petra oleum_, is used\r\nin the Anglo-Saxon “Leechdoms,” published in the Rolls Series, which\r\nRev. O. Cockayne, the editor, dates at 900; ii. 289. The Spaniards did\r\nnot use the word _naphtha_, which is described by Lebrixa as “el fuego\r\ncomo de alquitran.” _Naphtha_ does not occur in the tract, although it\r\nis found in Latin and Greek authors of the first and second centuries\r\nA.D.; in Pliny’s “Natural History,” ii. 109 (105); in Dioskorides, i.\r\n101; and in Plutarch’s “Alexander,” 35. It appears as _naphathe_ in\r\nthe “Speculum” of Vincentius Bellovacensis, 1228; _l._ i. _c._ 92.\r\nThe commonest Spanish word for one or other of the asphalt family,\r\n_alquitran_, occurs (as before mentioned) five times in the tract.\r\n\r\nOn referring to the Chemical Index, p. 68, it will be found that all\r\nthe foregoing Arabic and Spanish words occur in the Early Recipes. The\r\nMiddle Recipes contain only one Arabic word, _alambic_, recipes 27 and\r\n30, which is also found in the Early Recipes, No. 34; and one Spanish\r\nword, _petroleo_, recipe 26, which occurs twice in the earlier series,\r\nNos. 2 and 10. Now, Spain was the only European country in which\r\nArabic was understood during the Middle Ages. “In all Europe, outside\r\nSpain, but three isolated Arabists of that time are known—William of\r\nTyre, Philip of Tripoli, and Adelard of Bath.”[167] Pagnino printed\r\nan edition of the Qur’an at Venice in 1530, and it was immediately\r\nsuppressed by the Church; “a precaution hardly required,” says Hallam,\r\n“while there was no one able to read it.”[168] Furthermore, we know\r\nthat a series of Latin translations of Hebrew and Arabic MSS. were\r\nmade in Spain between the years 1182 and 1350.[169] We may therefore\r\nconclude with some little probability:—\r\n\r\n1°. That the Early Recipes were translated from a lost Arabic original.\r\n\r\n2°. That the translator was a Spaniard.\r\n\r\n3°. That the translation was made between the years 1182 and 1225.\r\n\r\n4°. That to this translation were added by other hands, before 1225,\r\nthe Middle Recipes, which practically contain neither Hispanicism nor\r\nArabism, and which make no mention of saltpetre.\r\n\r\n5°. That the Late Recipes were inserted towards the close of the\r\nthirteenth century.[170]\r\n\r\nOn accepting these conclusions, the difficulties raised by the\r\nhypothesis of a Greek original vanish. The Spanish translator had no\r\nneed to translate the _alkitran_ of the Arabic writer, for the word was\r\nSpanish as well as Arabic. Like all westerns, he called the Byzantines\r\nGreeks, and a certain incendiary Greek fire. Neither Moslem nor\r\nSpaniard was likely to speak of the sea-fire. Moslems would be loth\r\nto recall the disasters at Cyzicus and elsewhere, when this incendiary\r\nmade havoc of their ships; Spaniards knew nothing about it. Owing\r\nto the secrecy maintained by the Imperial Government, westerns knew\r\nvery little about Byzantine pyrotechnics. “At the end of the eleventh\r\ncentury the Pisans ... suffered the effects, without understanding the\r\ncause, of the Greek fire.”[171] The Princess Anna Comnena ascribes the\r\ndefeat of the Pisans in a naval battle fought in 1103, to an unknown\r\nincendiary employed by the Greeks.[172] In both cases the incendiary\r\ncould only have been the sea-fire, for the Latins had been acquainted\r\nwith ordinary incendiaries for a thousand years. As late as 1204, the\r\nEmperor Baldwin I., in a manifesto to all Christians, declares that the\r\nGreeks used “machines and defences to protect their capital (in this\r\nyear) which no one (from the West) had ever seen before.”[173]\r\n\r\nIt is time to inquire who was Marcus Græcus. He has been fancifully\r\nidentified with many of the Marci of history and fable, and M. Dutens\r\ndiscovered him in the second century A.D. The views of M. Dutens must\r\nbe noticed here, because they have been unwarily adopted by some good\r\nwriters.\r\n\r\nThere exists a Latin translation of a lost Arabic treatise on medicine,\r\n_De Simplicibus_, supposed by some to have been written by Masawyah of\r\nDamascus in the eleventh century,[174] while others, with M. Dutens,\r\nassign it to Yahya ibn Masawyah, who attended the Caliph Mamoun on\r\nhis deathbed,[175] 833 A.D. The question before us is, does the _De\r\nSimplicibus_ (whatever its date) contain any reference to Marcus? When\r\nmentioning the use of syrup of cyclamen, Masawyah quotes the opinions\r\nof other physicians: “The son of Serapion said (so and so) ... and a\r\nGreek (physician) says (so and so)” (_dixit filius Serapionis ... et\r\ndicit Græcus_).[176] On the last two words, _dicit Græcus_, M. Dutens\r\nbuilds his theory that the Greek physician was no other than Marcus:\r\n“Ce qui paroît fort probable, est que (Marcus Græcus) devoit vivre\r\navant le médicin arabe, Mesué, qui a paru au commencement du neuvième\r\nsiècle, puisque celui-ci le cite.[177] By this mode of reasoning,\r\nwhich is generally called “begging the question,” Marcus Græcus may be\r\nidentified at will with any Greek who ever lived. M. Dutens continues:\r\n“Fabricius croit que (Marcus Græcus) est le même dont Galen parle dans\r\nun endroit de ses ouvrages, au quel cas il serait du temps requis pour\r\nappuyer mon sentiment.” It would be strange indeed to find mention of\r\na Latin writer or book in a _Bibliotheca Græca_, and I have failed to\r\nverify M. Dutens’ reference. In the editions of Fabricius’ work which\r\nI have consulted he expresses no such belief, nor does he allude to\r\nMarcus Græcus. In the list Fabricius gives of ancient physicians there\r\nare several who bear the name of Marcus, but no Marcus Græcus. The\r\nlast of these Marci happens to be simply called “Marcus,” and of him\r\nFabricius says: “This Marcus, who is mentioned by Galen in his book on\r\ncompounding medicines, may possibly have been one of the foregoing”\r\n(_Marcus, simpliciter, Galeno in compositionibus medicamentorum_\r\nκατὰ τόπους, _l._ iv. _c._ 7, _quem credibile fuisse unum ex illis\r\nprioribus_).[178]\r\n\r\nThe _Liber Ignium_ was written from first to last in the period of\r\nliterary forgeries and pseudographs, which produced the “Book of\r\nHermes,” “The Domestic Chemistry of Moses,” the alchemical works of\r\nPlato and of Aristotle and of the Emperor Justinian, and so on; and\r\nwe may reasonably conclude that Marcus Græcus is as unreal as the\r\nimaginary Greek original of the tract which bears his name.\r\n\r\nHad the last editor of the _Liber Ignium_, who added the saltpetre\r\nreceipts, any knowledge of an explosive?\r\n\r\nWe need not linger over the Roman candle of No. 12, or the rocket of\r\nNo. 13: had their charges been explosive there would have been an end\r\nof the candle and rocket, and of the men who fired them. The cracker\r\nof No. 13 was a toy intended to “go off with a bang,” without hurt to\r\nthe bystanders. The case was to be as strong as possible and securely\r\nfastened at both ends with iron wires. It was to be half filled with\r\nrocket composition, a mixture which burned in a cracker-case precisely\r\nas it burned in a rocket-case—with progressive combustion. Now Roger\r\nBacon had a similar toy, constructed with the very same object, _i.e._\r\n“to go off with a bang,” the case of which was “merely a bit of paper.”\r\nWhy was there this marked difference, then, between the two cases?\r\nBecause the noise was produced in the one by the explosion of the\r\ncharge and in the other by the rupture of the case. Bacon’s charge\r\n(as will be shown in Chap. viii.) was gunpowder, and the required\r\n“bang” was directly produced by its explosion. Marcus’ toy was charged\r\nwith an incendiary, the combustion of which did not produce a “bang”\r\ndirectly, but which produced one indirectly by ultimately bursting\r\nopen the thick, stout case. The gases generated by its combustion\r\n“gradually developed until the case burst,”[179] just as a bladder\r\nbursts “with a bang” when over-inflated. Had Bacon’s toy been charged\r\nwith an incendiary, the case, which was only a sheet of paper, would\r\nhave been set on fire by the heated gases long before their pressure\r\nhad reached the bursting point, and there would have been no “bang.”\r\nHad Marcus’ toy been charged with an explosive, it would have exploded\r\ndestructively, and what was intended for a public diversion would have\r\nproved a common danger, owing to the thickness of the case and the\r\niron wire coiled round it. There is nothing in the tract to show that\r\nits authors had any notion of explosives, and their silence, without\r\nany assignable motive, is strong evidence that they knew nothing about\r\nthem. It is incredible that pyrotechnists who seldom omit to call\r\nattention to the effects of their incendiaries,[180] should have failed\r\nto make some allusion to explosives if they possessed them. Their\r\nsilence was not owing to fear of the Church, for the decree of the\r\nSecond Council of the Lateran was directed against the very mixtures\r\nwhich form the staple of the _Liber Ignium_, incendiaries.[181] The\r\n12th and 13th recipes contain the ingredients of the future gunpowder;\r\nthey form the last link in the long chain of evolution which connects\r\nthe incendiaries of primitive times with gunpowder; but they were not\r\ngunpowder, because they did not explode. The chrysalis, we know, will\r\nbecome a butterfly if it lives; nevertheless it would be an abuse of\r\nlanguage and a misrepresentation of fact to call it a butterfly.\r\n\r\nThe reader can now appreciate the value of the argument that the\r\nGreeks possessed an explosive between the seventh and thirteenth\r\ncenturies, _because_ Marcus Græcus describes one; and he can understand\r\nwhy Marcus was not summoned in Chap. iii. to give evidence for the\r\nGreeks.\r\n\r\nA suspicion may be raised by the Arabic origin of the _Liber Ignium_,\r\nthat the people who approached so nearly to the manufacture of\r\ngunpowder may have ultimately reached it. We pass, therefore, to a\r\nconsideration of Arabic incendiaries in the following chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE ARABS\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the Arabs had had relations with the Greeks, Romans, and\r\nPersians for centuries, and were acquainted with the details of the\r\nsiege of Jerusalem, 70 A.D., the earliest allusion to their use of\r\nmachines is the tradition that Jodhaimah, King of Heerah, constructed\r\nmanjánik in the third century A.D.[182] The scarcity of timber in\r\nArabia may partially explain the lateness of their introduction, and\r\nthe position of Heerah, in the north-east province of Arabian Irak,\r\nraises a suspicion that the Arabs learned the use of machines from the\r\nPersians, who got them from the Greeks.\r\n\r\nWhen the Prophet besieged Tayif in 8 A.H. (630 A.D.), the defenders\r\nhad recourse to heated projectiles.[183] We may safely assume that\r\nthey were the balls of hot clay spoken of in the 11nth Sura of the\r\nQur’an, in describing the destruction of the Cities of the Plain:\r\n“we rained upon them stones of baked clay.”[184] Half a century\r\nafterwards, 683, during the siege of Mecca, the Ka’aba was burned\r\ndown by incendiary compositions, discharged, not by Arabs, but by\r\nSyrians, who doubtless understood the manipulation of naphtha and the\r\nother combustibles used.[185] In 712 the howdah in which sat Dahir,\r\nKing of Alor in Scinde, was set on fire by a fire-arrow shot by a\r\nMoslem naphtha-thrower[186]—the same nature of projectile that had\r\nbeen used by the Persian archers at the taking of Athens, 480 B.C.\r\nIn speaking of the capture of Alor, both Mir Ma’sum Bhakkari, in his\r\n“History of Scinde,” and Haidar Razi, in his “General History,” mention\r\nthe employment of _atish bazi_, or fire-throwing machines, “which the\r\nMoslems had seen in use with the Greeks and Persians.”[187] Stones were\r\ndischarged from machines to so little purpose at the siege of Heraclea,\r\n805, that Harun er-Reshid urged his generals to fasten incendiaries\r\nto them. This was done with such effect that the resistance of the\r\nbesieged at once collapsed, the inhabitants being terror-stricken\r\nat the sight of the flaming naphtha.[188] There is no trace of an\r\nexplosive here, yet a French Arabist would have us believe that muskets\r\nwere in use during this Caliph’s reign.\r\n\r\n_Al-bunduqani_, the man who carries a _bunduq_, which in this\r\nconnection is a contraction for _qaus al-bunduq_, or simply _qaus\r\nbunduq_,[189] was an epithet bestowed on Harun by the public, or\r\nassumed by himself; and in translating one of the “Arabian Nights”\r\nwith this title, M. Gauttier remarks: “Bondouk signifie en Arabe\r\nharquebuse, albondoukani signifie l’arquebusier.”[190] This argument\r\nmay be illustrated by a more familiar one: “Jonathan gave his artillery\r\nunto his lad” (1 Sam. xx. 40); but artillery signifies cannon;\r\ntherefore, &c. &c. It may be remarked that _arquebuse_ is ambiguous.\r\n“Avant d’être une arme à feu l’arquebuse était une arme à jet,” says\r\nDr. Dozy,[191] who is supported by M. Scheler: “l’arquebuse était à\r\nson origine une sorte d’arbalète.”[192] Assuming, however, as Gauttier\r\nevidently did, that _arquebuse_ meant a firearm, his argument only\r\nestablishes the use of firearms in the ninth century, if we take\r\n_signifie_ as equivalent to _means now, in the year 1822, and meant\r\nalso in the time of Harun_. The question, therefore, turns upon the\r\nmeaning of the words _bunduq_, or _qaus bunduq_, in the time of the\r\ngreat Caliph, and an anecdote told by Masudi leaves no doubt about what\r\nthat meaning was.[193] He tells us that in the time of Muhtadi Billah,\r\n868-9, a negligent porter was sentenced by his master to be tied up\r\n(apparently in a room or courtyard) and shot at fifty times by a man\r\narmed with a _qaus bunduq_, which carried leaden _bunduq_. There is not\r\nthe slightest allusion to charge, cartridge, gunpowder, wad, or match,\r\nnor to the operation of loading. The ammunition consisted solely of\r\nleaden balls. Although the marksman sent his fifty _bunduq_ home, the\r\nporter was so little the worse for his punishment that, when all was\r\nover, he made a coarse but cutting remark to his tormentor. There can\r\nbe no question of firearms here: one, or at most two bullets fired by\r\nso good a shot from any firearm ever constructed would have silenced\r\nthe porter for ever. The marksman was _al-bunduqani_, the _bunduq_ were\r\nleaden balls, and the _qaus bunduq_ was a pellet-bow = stone-bow[194]\r\n= كلوله كمان (golulé keman) = _golail_, used to this day by the Karens\r\nof Burma, and known to everybody who has been in India. Such is the\r\nexplanation of _qaus bunduq_ given by the commentator Tabrizi in a note\r\non one of Motanebbi’s poems—a bow which discharges a ball as big as a\r\nhazel nut.[195] The bow itself is a long-bow with two strings joined at\r\ntheir centre by a bit of cloth or soft leather, which supports a ball\r\ngenerally of baked clay or stone. If Hansard’s plate be correct, the\r\nwestern stone-bow was a cross-bow with two strings.[196] The golail, as\r\nwe learn from one of the oldest of the “Arabian Nights,” was chiefly\r\nused for shooting birds, squirrels, &c.: “he shooteth birds with a\r\npellet of clay,”[197] ببندقة من طين. Again, when the first Kalandar\r\nmissed his bird and hit the Wazir in the eye, he was using a _qaus\r\nal-bunduq_,[198] قوس النبدق. The insult conveyed by the words of the\r\nSultan Kai-kubad, when speaking of the dead leader of the Mughals, lay\r\nin the fact that the golail was not a soldier’s weapon, but merely a\r\nsporting implement: “No one would condescend to shoot an arrow at a\r\ndead body; it is only a pellet-ball that is fit for such (carrion) as\r\nthis.”[199] We need not pursue the matter further: in the primitive and\r\nsimple golail is found the musket carried by the Caliph Harun er-Reshid.\r\n\r\nFrom a passage in the “Chachnama,” given in Barnes’ “Travels into\r\nBokhara,” it is clear that the Moslems in their invasion of India\r\nrelied upon incendiaries to meet the attacks made upon them with\r\nelephants, which are very much afraid of fire. At the battle of Alor,\r\n712, already mentioned, the Moslems “filled their pipes” (_hukkaha-e\r\natish bazi_ = grenades or siphons) “and returned with them to dart fire\r\nat the elephants” (i. 67). This fact goes far to explain a difficulty\r\nraised by the words _toofung_ (musket) and _tope_ (cannon) found in\r\nsome MSS., in place of the _khudung_ (arrow) and _nuft_ (naphtha)\r\ngiven in other copies of Ferishta’s account of the battle fought near\r\nPeshawur in 1008. He says: “On a sudden the elephant upon which the\r\nprince who commanded the Hindus rode, becoming unruly from the effects\r\nof the _naphtha balls_ and the flights of _arrows_, turned and fled.\r\nThis circumstance produced a panic among the Hindus, who, seeing\r\nthemselves deserted by their general, gave way and fled also.”[200]\r\nThe best critics reject the readings _musket_ and _cannon_ in this\r\npassage. These words were unknown to other Indian historians, and the\r\ncircumstances of the case make the use of an incendiary exceedingly\r\nprobable.\r\n\r\n“I am slow in believing this premature use of artillery,” says Gibbon;\r\n“I must desire to scrutinise first the text and then the authority\r\nof Ferishta.” “These readings must be due to interpolators,” adds\r\nProfessor Bury.[201] “It appears likely,” says General Briggs,\r\nthe translator of Ferishta, “that Babar was the first invader who\r\nintroduced great guns into Upper India, in 1526, so that the words\r\n_tope_ and _toofung_ have been probably introduced by ignorant\r\ntranscribers of the modern copies of this work, which are in general\r\nvery faulty throughout.”[202]\r\n\r\nSir H. M. Elliot says: “The _Tarikh-i Yamini_, the _Jami’u-t Tawarikh_\r\nof Rashidu-d Din, the _Tarikh-i Guzida_, Abu’l Fida, the _Tabakat-i\r\nNasiri_, the _Rauzatu’-s Safa_, the _Tarikh-i Alfi_ and the _Tabakat-i\r\nAkbari_, though almost all of them notice this important engagement ...\r\nand mention the capture of thirty elephants, yet none of them speak of\r\neither _naft_ or _tope_.”[203]\r\n\r\nFinally, we must remember that there is an abundant supply of naphtha\r\nin the neighbourhood of Peshawur,[204] and that the practice of\r\nthrowing incendiary missiles was universal in Asia long before the\r\nbattle in question. The Ka’aba, as we have seen, was burnt down by\r\nincendiaries in 683, and this tremendous event of course became\r\ninstantly known all over Islam. At the battle of Alor, 712, the\r\nMoslems specially prepared incendiaries to repulse the attacks of the\r\nelephants. Igneous projectiles were employed by Harun er-Reshid in 805\r\nat the siege of Heraclea. The last day of the siege of Baghdad, 813,\r\nis described by the poet Ali as “a day of fire”: “the machines played\r\nfrom the hostile camps ... and fire and ruin filled Baghdad.”[205] So\r\nwell known were incendiary shell in Persia at the close of the tenth\r\ncentury that Firdusi mentions them in the episode of Nushirvan and\r\nPorphyry: “The Romans began the fight from the gates and discharged\r\narrows and pots (of fire).”[206] In 1067 Shems al-Mulk Nasr, when\r\nbesieging Bokhara, ordered incendiaries to be discharged against some\r\narchers posted in the minaret of the Grand Mosque. The wooden roof of\r\nthe minaret took fire, the sparks fell upon the main building, and in\r\nthe end the whole mosque was burned down.[207]\r\n\r\nWe may rest assured, then, that the words Ferishta wrote in his\r\naccount of the battle near Peshawur, 1008, were _naphtha_ and _arrow_,\r\nnot _musket_ and _cannon_.\r\n\r\nFar from possessing muskets in the ninth century, there is no evidence\r\nto show that the Arabs had firearms, that is, arms charged with an\r\nexplosive, during the whole of the Crusade period, 1097-1291. So\r\nstrange and deadly an agent of destruction as gunpowder could not\r\npossibly have been employed in the field without the full knowledge\r\nof both parties; yet no historian, Christian or Moslem, alludes to\r\nan explosive of any kind, while all of them carefully record the use\r\nof incendiaries. The Arab accounts of these campaigns will be found\r\ncollected together in M. Reinaud’s _Extraits des Historiens Arabes\r\nrelatifs aux guerres des Croisades_, Paris, 1829; the Christian\r\naccounts are scattered in various volumes; but they teach us no more\r\nthan we have learnt already in the two preceding chapters about\r\nincendiaries and Greek fire: “les projectiles incendiaires ont pu\r\nrester à peu près les mêmes pendant toutes ces Croisades.”[208]\r\n\r\nAt the siege of Nice, first Crusade, we read of the Saracens\r\nthrowing balls of pitch, oil and fat against the machines of the\r\nChristians.[209] Fire-arrows bearing pitch, wax, sulphur, and tow were\r\ndischarged from the walls of Jerusalem during the siege in the same\r\nCrusade.[210]\r\n\r\nDuring the second Crusade we find the Arabs making use of similar\r\nincendiaries,[211] mixtures practically identical with that of\r\nÆneas Tacticus, _cir._ 350 B.C., given in Table II. Shell full of\r\nburning naphtha were used at the siege of Acre, 1189-91, in the third\r\nCrusade;[212] and Richard of England, on his voyage thither, sank a\r\nship which an eye-witness had seen laded at Beyrut with ballista,\r\nbows, arrows, and lances, and a large supply of Greek fire secured in\r\nbottles (_ignem Græcum abundanter in phialis_),[213] a phrase which\r\nreminds us of the 18th recipe of the _Liber Ignium_ of Marcus Græcus:\r\n“put the mixture in a glass bottle” (_hoc in vase vitreo ponatur_). For\r\nthe sixth Crusade, we have the invaluable _Histoire du Roy Saint Loys_\r\nof Joinville, who describes the terror excited by the incendiaries of\r\nthe Moslems, believed by all to be the work of the Powers of Darkness.\r\n“Quant le bon chevalier Messire Gaultier mon compagnon vit ce feu, il\r\ns’escrie et nous dist: Seigneurs, nous sommes perduz á jamais sans\r\nnul remède. Car s’ilz bruslent nos chaz chateilz, nous sommes ars\r\net bruslez; et si nous laissons nos gardes, nous sommes ahontez....\r\nEt toutes les fois que nostre bon Roy saint Loys oyoit qu’ils nous\r\ngettoient ainsi ce feu, il se jettoit à terre, et tendoit ses mains\r\nla face levée au ciel, et crioit à haulte voix à nostre Seigneur, et\r\ndisoit en pleurant à grans larmes: Beausire Dieu Jesuchrist, garde moy\r\net tout magent,” &c.[214] Yet the incendiaries which created all this\r\npanic appear to have wounded but few and to have killed nobody!\r\n\r\nAlthough no evidence is forthcoming to show that explosives were used\r\nin Palestine during the Crusade period, there is good evidence, it\r\nhas been said, to prove that gunpowder was used by the Arabs in Spain\r\nduring the thirteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe first, I believe, to start the theory that the Spanish Arabs\r\npossessed gunpowder at this early period was Michael Casiri, a\r\nMaronite, who was librarian of the Escorial and published his\r\n_Bibliotheca Arabico Hispana Escurialensis_ in 1760-70; and his method\r\nof supporting his theory when translating the MS. of Shehab ben Fadhl,\r\nwhich he dates at 1249, was the simple one of translating barud by\r\n_pulvis nitratus_, the recognised Latin phrase for gunpowder.[215] Had\r\nhe translated _barud_ by _saltpetre_ no difficulty could have arisen,\r\nsince an Arab alchemist, Abd Allah, states that saltpetre was so called\r\nin the West during the second quarter of the thirteenth century.[216]\r\nThere would be nothing surprising, therefore, in finding saltpetre\r\nmixtures employed in Spain at this period; but saltpetre mixtures, such\r\nas the last three given in Table II., are not necessarily explosive.\r\nNot only is Casiri’s translation of _barud_ unwarrantable, but he\r\nprobably dates his MS. a century too early. M. Reinaud, a safe guide,\r\nbelieves that the MS. is Al-Omari’s, and dates 1349,[217] eighteen\r\nyears after the siege of Cividale where the Germans used cannon,[218]\r\nand three years after _Cressy_ where we certainly had guns.[219]\r\n\r\nCasiri’s methods are well illustrated by his translation of an Arabic\r\npassage relating to the siege of Baza, 1325, by Ismael ben Nasr, King\r\nof Granada. The literal translation of the passage is as follows: “He\r\n(the King) marched through the enemy’s country to the town of Baza,\r\nwhich he invested and attacked. By means of a great machine provided\r\nwith naphtha (made up in) hot (burning) balls, he struck the arch of\r\nan inaccessible tower.”[220] According to Casiri the passage reads:\r\n“Shifting his camp, he besieged with a large army the town of Baza,\r\nwhere, by applying fire, he discharged (_explosit_) with much noise\r\na great machine, provided with naphtha and a ball, into a fortified\r\ntower.”[221] He introduces, it will be observed, an explosion\r\n(_explosit_) into a passage which neither mentions nor suggests one.\r\nThe application of fire has no place in the original, and suggests the\r\nignition of an explosive charge. He changes the meaning of the original\r\nby gratuitously inserting an _and_ between naphtha and ball, which\r\nwere one and the same thing. He leaves us to infer that the charge was\r\nnaphtha, though it was not explosive and could not project a ball. He\r\nspeaks of the explosion being accompanied by a loud noise, of which\r\nthere is nothing in the original. The incendiary balls are mentioned\r\nin another Arabic account of this siege, translated by Conde in his\r\n_Historia de la Dominacion de los Arabes en Espagna_, p. 593: “The\r\nArabs attacked the city night and day with machines and engines which\r\nthrew balls of fire with a loud noise” (_combatio la ciudad de dia y\r\nnoche con maquinas é ingenios que lanzaban globos de fuego con grandes\r\ntruenos_).\r\n\r\nIn this passage the discharge of the incendiary balls is said to\r\nhave been accompanied by “thunderings,” and at the siege of Niébla,\r\n1257, we are again told that the Moors “launched stones and darts\r\nfrom machines, and missiles of thunder with fire” (_lanzaban piedras\r\ny dardos con maguinas, y tiros de trueno con fuego_).[222] From this\r\ninnocent metaphor, _trueno con fuego_, the Emperor Leo’s “thunder\r\nwith smoke,” has been wrenched the meaning that the Arabs possessed\r\na train of artillery. “Il n’y a rien à cela que de vraisemblable,”\r\nsays the Emperor Napoleon III.[223] Nothing, I venture to think, can\r\nbe more unlikely. The Arab writer is dealing with machines which, he\r\nsays in his own way, discharged stones and darts, and also igneous\r\nmissiles which burned with much noise. Another Arab, already quoted\r\n(p. 4), gives a freer rein to his fancy: the projectiles “roar like\r\nthunder; they flame like a furnace; they reduce everything to ashes.”\r\nIn plain words, they are incendiaries. The writer makes no allusion to\r\nthe effect of their momentum or shock; he impresses on us the effect\r\nof their essential quality—their incendiary power, exaggerating the\r\nnoise made by their combustion. Joinville writes in a similar style of\r\nGreek fire: “La manière du feu grégeois estoit telle ... Il faisoit tel\r\nbruit à venir qu’il sembloit que ce fust fouldre qui cheust du ciel ...\r\net gettoit si grant clarté qu’il faisoit aussi cler dedans nostre ost\r\ncomme le jour, tant y avoit grant flamme de feu.”[224] Unless we make\r\ndue allowance for the luxuriant Oriental imagination, we may despair\r\nof ever being able to reach the meaning of the Eastern writers. One of\r\nthem wants to explain that the ditch of a fort was deep and wide, and\r\nhe tells us it was “broad as the ocean and fathomless.”[225] Wishing to\r\nstate that on the arrival of the army on its banks, the Nerbudda, which\r\nhappened to be in flood, subsided quickly, another writer says: “You\r\nmight say that it (the river) was a remnant of the universal deluge.\r\nAs the miraculous power of the saintly Sultan accompanied the Army, all\r\nthe whirlpools and depths became of themselves immediately dry on the\r\narrival of the Army, and the Musulmans passed over with ease.”[226] A\r\nsimilar indulgence in metaphor, although not so unbridled, is found in\r\nEuropean writers. For instance, Vegetius likens the projectile hurled\r\nby an onager to a thunderbolt;[227] and the Princess Anna Comnena\r\ncompares the fiery particles blown by the breath through a popgun, or\r\nspitfire, to lightning.[228]\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to examine the accounts given by Conde of the\r\nsiege of Tarifa, 1340, and by Casiri of the siege of Algesiras, 1342,\r\nsince both sieges took place some years after that of Cividale, 1331.\r\nThe reader will find the two accounts ably analysed in Reinaud and\r\nFavé, pp. 70-74.\r\n\r\nIf the Arabs had possessed an explosive in the thirteenth century, the\r\nfact must have been known to their alchemists, and they show no such\r\nknowledge. There is not an allusion to saltpetre in the Leyden Arabic\r\nMS. of 1225.[229] Hassan er-Rammah, who died in 1295, knew nothing\r\nof explosives. In speaking of saltpetre in the year 1311, Yusuf ibn\r\nIsmaël al-Juni says: “The people of Irak use it to make a fire which\r\ntends to rise and move. Saltpetre increases the ease and rapidity\r\nof ignition.”[230] This sentence contains the sum total of Yusuf’s\r\nknowledge of saltpetre mixtures. He was aware of the effects of their\r\nprogressive combustion, but he knew nothing about their explosive\r\ncombustion.\r\n\r\nBy whomsoever gunpowder was invented, it was not by the Arabs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE HINDUS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the third quarter of the eighteenth century, by order of Warren\r\nHastings, a committee of Brahmins collected a body of Gentoo (or\r\nHindu) laws from a number of ancient Sanskrit books. These laws were\r\ntranslated into Persian under the superintendence of one of the\r\nBrahmins, and the Persian version was translated into English in 1776\r\nby Mr. N. B. Halhed, Bengal Civil Service. In his preface he states\r\nthat gunpowder had been known in India “far beyond all periods of\r\ninvestigation,” a conclusion arrived at by a method now familiar to the\r\nreader: “the word ‘firearms’ is literally in Sanskrit _agni astra_ ...\r\nCannon in the Sanskrit idiom is _shataghni_.”\r\n\r\n_Agni_ is found in the Latin _ignis_ = fire; _astra_, Romocki explains,\r\nis connected with the Slav _ostr_ = point (of an arrow, &c.); and\r\nthe compound _agniastra_ is simply a fire-arrow or rocket. In the\r\n_shataghni_, or “hundred killer,” we have some weapon described in the\r\nexaggerated style usual in early times and by no means confined to\r\nIndia. When Sigurd struck an anvil with his sword Gram, “he cleft it\r\ndown to the stock thereof;”[231] and “if one smote a mountain” with\r\nal-Mahik (the annihilator) the sword of Gharib, “‘twould overthrow\r\nit.”[232] There is nothing to connect the _shataghni_ with fire: indeed\r\nit seems to have been a mace, for in the “Raghuvansa” the demon is\r\nsaid to have laid his iron-headed shataghni upon Rama, just as Kuvera\r\nlaid his club on Jamraj.[233] No mention of any projectile discharged\r\nby an explosive is to be found in Manu’s “Code of Laws,” and to Manu\r\nbelongs a passage in the “Code of Gentoo Laws” (p. 53) which either\r\nHalhed has mistranslated from the Persian, or the Persian translators\r\nhave mistranslated from the Sanskrit. Professor Rāy has unearthed\r\nthe original text of Manu (vii. 90), and gives the correct translation:\r\n“The king shall not slay his enemies in battle with deceitful or barbed\r\nor poisoned weapons, nor with any having a blade made red hot by\r\nfire,[234] or tipped with burning materials.”[235] Halhed’s translation\r\nis: “The magistrate shall not make war with any deceitful machine, or\r\nwith poisoned weapons, or with cannon and guns, or with any other kind\r\nof firearms.” Mephistopheles was right:—\r\n\r\n  “Mit Worten lässt sich trefflich streiten,\r\n  Mit Worten ein System bereiten.”\r\n\r\nHalhed’s mistakes might have been forgotten had they not been revived\r\nand elaborated by Professor G. Oppert in an essay “On the Weapons,\r\n&c., of the Ancient Hindus,” London, 1880. His argument is briefly\r\nthis: firearms are clearly mentioned in the “Laws of Manu” and two very\r\nancient Sanskrit poems; therefore at some very remote period the Hindus\r\npossessed an explosive which, for whatever reason, fell into disuse\r\neventually.\r\n\r\n“Does the passage in Manu refer to firearms or not?” asks Dr. Oppert.\r\n“In our opinion it certainly alludes to them” (p. 70). We need not\r\nrecur to the mistranslation of Manu already noticed.\r\n\r\nThe two poems on which Dr. Oppert relies for further evidence are\r\nthe _Nitiprakásika_ of Vaisampayana, and the _Sukraniti_ of Sukra.\r\nAccording to the former, the Hindu deities, Sita, Indra, Krishna, &c.,\r\nwere authors of “books on polity.” Brahma’s contribution to literature\r\nconsisted of 10,000,000 double verses (p. 36). The constitution of an\r\narmy was as follows (p. 5):—\r\n\r\n  Foot                       2,187,000,000\r\n\r\n  Horse                         21,870,000\r\n\r\n  Elephants                        218,700\r\n\r\n  Chariots                          21,870\r\n\r\nThe “arms in use” of one species were forty-four in number; of another\r\nspecies, fifty-five. Rabelais has only succeeded in cataloguing\r\nforty-six arms in the introduction to the third book of “Pantagruel.”\r\nLest the ninety-nine arms in use might fail to ensure success, a spell\r\n(of thirty-two syllables) is given (p. 10) which would bring certain\r\nvictory to him who repeated it 32,000 times. Both of these veracious\r\nworks, however, undoubtedly mention cannon and muskets, and a recipe\r\nfor gunpowder is given in the _Sukraniti_.[236]\r\n\r\nDr. Oppert makes no critical examination of the texts of these poems to\r\nascertain whether they contain the interpolations to be found in most\r\nOriental works. Of their age he only says that “no Chinese work ...\r\ncan, with respect to antiquity, be compared with the _Sukraniti_” (p.\r\n45). As the reader will find in the following chapter, this implies a\r\nconsiderable age.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to believe that gunpowder was known to a people whose\r\nlanguage contained no word for saltpetre;[237] that cannon were used by\r\nmen whose books make no allusion to gunpowder, with the exception just\r\nmentioned. “It is peculiar,” says Dr. Oppert, “that powder should not\r\nhave been mentioned in Sanskrit works” (p. 63). The same peculiarity\r\nis observable in Anglo-Saxon works, and is probably due to the same\r\ncause. But the fatal objection to the existence of this very early\r\nexplosive is the admitted fact that after a time it was discarded and\r\nforgotten. Writers who lightly tell us so are apparently unconscious\r\nof the greatness of the demand they make upon our credulity. They ask\r\nus, in effect, to accept the astonishing proposition, that a nation\r\nvoluntarily surrendered, without any assignable cause, an incalculable\r\n“advantage” in the “struggle for existence”—the eager, continuous,\r\nand unending preparation for self-defence which is, in Mr. Bagehot’s\r\nwords, “the most showy fact” in human history. It is infinitely more\r\nprobable that the passages in the two poems which mention gunpowder and\r\ncannon were interpolated by the scribes of after-ages than that the\r\nHindus wantonly broke the first and strongest law of human nature, the\r\nlaw of self-defence. There can be no reasonable doubt that the recipe\r\nfor gunpowder in the _Sukraniti_ is an interpolation. The proportions\r\nare given in the first place as 5:1:1, and then it is added, “if the\r\npowder is to be used for a gun,” let them be 4:1:1, or 6:1:1.[238] And\r\nwhy not 5:1:1 also? This recipe was not written by a gunner: it is the\r\nhandiwork of some charlatan of the sixteenth or seventeenth century,\r\nwho imagined that, by making a certain mystery about the proportions\r\n5:1:1, he should give a semblance of great antiquity to the recipe.\r\nBut he blundered badly about the proportions. The proportions 4:1:1\r\nwere only reached by the Swedes about the middle of the sixteenth[239]\r\ncentury, and approached by the English about the middle of the\r\nseventeenth,[240] and powder of such strength would have blown weak,\r\nearly bombards to pieces. Other sound reasons are given by competent\r\ncritics for rejecting from first to last the allusions to firearms\r\ncontained in the two poems. A critic in _Nature_ points out that a\r\nwork which mentions the Hunas (Huns or Europeans) cannot be of the\r\nage apparently assigned by Dr. Oppert to the _Nitiprakásika_.[241]\r\n“Oppert,” says Sir R. Burton, “shows no reason why the allusions\r\nto, and descriptions of, gunpowder and firearms should not be held\r\nmodern interpolations into these absurd compositions.”[242] Mr. W. F.\r\nSinclair concludes from the strong resemblance between the firearms\r\ndescribed and those which we know were imported into India during\r\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, either that the MSS. date\r\nno further back than the sixteenth century, or that the allusions to\r\nfirearms were interpolated at that period.[243] “One is naturally led\r\nto suspect,” says Professor Ray, “that the lines (of the _Sukraniti_)\r\nrelating to gunpowder ... are interpolations.” The suspicion is further\r\nenhanced when it is borne in mind that in the “Polity of Kamandaki,”\r\nan ancient work of undoubted authenticity, “there occurs no reference\r\nwhatever to firearms, nor is there any in the _Agnipurana_, in which\r\nthe subject of training in the use of arms and armour takes up four\r\nchapters.... The more rational conclusion would be that the _Sukraniti_\r\nis a patchwork, in which portions of chap. iv. were added some time\r\nafter the introduction of gunpowder in Indian warfare during the\r\nMoslem period.”[244] “The last chapter is apparently spurious,” says\r\nRajendralala Mitra, “as it describes guns as they existed a hundred\r\nyears ago.”[245] Finally, Herr von Romocki utterly rejects Dr.\r\nOppert’s theory.[246]\r\n\r\nThe military history of India confirms the conclusions of the writers\r\nwho have been quoted: not a fact is to be found there which lends any\r\nsupport to the theory of early gunpowder in India.\r\n\r\nThe employment of gunpowder in Europe revolutionised the art of war\r\nand affected, more or less, almost every human institution. “The\r\nmilitary art,” says Gibbon, “has been changed by the invention of\r\ngunpowder.... Mathematics, chymistry, mechanics, architecture, have\r\nbeen applied to the science of war.”[247] Gunpowder, says A. Comte,\r\n“en emprimant à l’art de la guerre un caractère de plus en plus\r\nscientifique, a directement tendu à intéresser tous les pouvoirs à\r\nl’actif dévellopement continu de la philosophie naturelle.”[248] We\r\nmay reasonably assume that the discovery of so tremendous an agent as\r\ngunpowder would have produced in India some few effects, at least,\r\nsimilar in their general features to the effects it produced in Europe.\r\nTo mention one or two details: Sanskrit would have coined a word for\r\nsaltpetre, which it did not possess; the use of the bow would have\r\nbeen curtailed; a lasting mark would have been put on fortifications;\r\nand some few specimens of the early firearms might have survived. Not\r\na trace of these or similar changes is to be found; not a vestige of\r\nearly firearms has remained. General Cunningham thought that the state\r\nof the ruins of certain ancient Kashmir temples proves the use of an\r\nexplosive in their destruction,[249] but more prolonged observation\r\nshows that their condition is chiefly the effect of natural agencies.\r\n“The fingers of Time, and moderate movements of the earth, have been\r\nmaking openings in some of the other old Hindu buildings in Kashmir,”\r\nsuch as the little temple of Payach and the splendid temple of Martand;\r\n“and from their appearance it may be believed that these same agencies,\r\ntogether with undermining work applied for wilful destruction, could\r\ndo what has been done.”[250] The plentiful supply of saltpetre to be\r\nfound in the valley of the Ganges has been brought forward as a proof\r\nthat the ancient Hindus must have had gunpowder, but the fact proves\r\nnothing. How many centuries did coal lie within reach of man’s hand,\r\nin England and elsewhere, before it was discovered and made use of?\r\nThe attractive property of the magnet was known to Plato in the fifth\r\ncentury B.C., and Lucretius in the first century B.C. devotes a long\r\npassage of his poem to it (vi. 909-1089); yet its property of pointing\r\nnorth and south when free to move horizontally is first distinctly\r\nmentioned (in Europe) in the twelfth century A.D.[251]\r\n\r\nEarly Indian gunpowder is a fiction.\r\n\r\nThe first gunpowder and firearms used in India were neither invented\r\nnor manufactured by the Hindus: they were imported during the\r\nMiddle Ages from the West. The guns of Upper India entered through\r\nAfghanistan; those of Western India were brought by ships. Let us\r\nconsider the latter first.\r\n\r\n“If any reliance is to be placed on Moulla Daud Bidury, the author of\r\n_Tohfutu-s Salutin_,” says General Briggs, “guns were used (in 1368)\r\nby the Hindus (of Bijanagar), and in a subsequent passage (Ferishta\r\nremarks) that the Muhammadans used them for the first time during the\r\nnext campaign. But I am disposed to doubt the validity of both these\r\nstatements.... Ferishta ... also observes that Turks and Europeans\r\nskilled in gunnery worked the artillery. That guns were in common use\r\nbefore the arrival of the Portuguese in India in 1498, seems certain\r\nfrom the mention of Faria y Sousa.”[252]\r\n\r\nThe first observation suggested by this passage is, that Ferishta does\r\nnot say the Hindus had _guns_ on this occasion; he says they had عرابه\r\n(_’arábah_),[253] a word which originally meant a _cart_. In the early\r\ndays of field artillery the guns were carried in carts,[254] from which\r\nthey were taken and laid on trestles when required for use. Wheeled\r\ngun-carriages only came into general use in Europe during the reign of\r\nLouis XI. of France (1461-83).[255] Things followed the same course in\r\nIndia, and the word ’arába thus came in time to have two meanings; most\r\narába being simply carts, some being (so to speak) gun-carriages. Then\r\nlater writers arose who insisted that all ’arába were gun-carriages at\r\nthe early date of 1368, because _some_ ’arába were gun-carriages in\r\nand after 1526. Ferishta (who died about 1611) fell into the trap, and\r\nafter him fell several modern historians.\r\n\r\nSecondly, General Briggs’ conclusion about guns in India before 1498\r\nseems somewhat unguarded. It is beyond dispute that firearms were used\r\non the west coast of India during the last quarter of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, but the evidence we possess points to the conclusion that\r\nthey belonged almost exclusively to Arab and Portuguese ships. The\r\nfact that Captain Cook cruised on the coast of Otaheite in 1769 in\r\na ship equipped with firearms, does not warrant the conclusion that\r\nthe natives possessed firearms. Ferishta was writing about events\r\nwhich took place two hundred years before he was born, and there is a\r\nparticular reason for doubting the existence of firearms in Bijanagar\r\nat this early period.\r\n\r\nIn 1441 ’Abd ur-Razzak, who had been sent to India by Shah Rukh on an\r\nembassy to Calicut, visited Bijanagar, whose ruins may still be seen on\r\nthe banks of the Tumbhadra. He has given us a full and amusing account\r\nof what he saw, bursting forth into poetry on the ugliness of the\r\nnatives:—\r\n\r\n  “I have loved a moon-faced beauty,\r\n   But I cannot fall in love with every black woman.”[256]\r\n\r\nHe was present at the great review held during the festival of\r\nMahanawi, when “the number of people and the huge elephants resembled\r\nthe green sea and the myriads which will appear on the Plains of the\r\nResurrection.” Not an allusion is made to firearms, although he notices\r\nthe naphtha-throwers mounted on elephants.[257]\r\n\r\nFerishta tells us that in the year 887 A.H. (A.D. 1482), Mahmoud Shah\r\nBegurra of Gujarat, hearing that Cambay was likely to be raided by the\r\npirates of Bulsar, collected a fleet containing “a force of gunners,\r\nmusketeers, and archers,” and defeated them. On this passage General\r\nBriggs remarks: “This is the first mention of artillery and musketry\r\nin the Gujarat history. They were probably introduced by the Arabs and\r\nTurks from the Red Sea and Persian Gulf.”[258] The firearms that came\r\nfrom the Persian Gulf must have been few and far between. Writing in\r\n1549, a Jesuit says: “The Persians use no bombards or arms of this\r\nkind.”[259]\r\n\r\nThere is no mention of the Bulsar expedition in the “History of\r\nGujarat,” by Ali Muhammad Khan, translated by Mr. J. Bird.\r\n\r\nThe _Mirat-i Sikandari_, a history of Gujarat translated by Sir E. C.\r\nBayley, speaks of an attack made by Mahmoud on certain pirates as early\r\nas 878 A.H. (A.D. 1473), but neither Bulsar nor firearms are mentioned.\r\nWe are told, however, that during a previous expedition in the same\r\nyear against the island of Sankhodhar, the infidels (Hindus) “resisted\r\nbravely and kept up a sustained discharge of arrows and muskets” (pp.\r\n198-9).\r\n\r\nFerishta relates that during the siege of Champanir, 1484, a shell\r\n(_hookah_) fell on the Rajah’s palace; but he does not state how it was\r\ndischarged, nor whether it was explosive or incendiary.[260]\r\n\r\nOn landing at Calicut in 1498, Vasco da Gama and his followers were\r\nled through the streets with tomtoms beating, and from time to time an\r\n_espingarda_, or musket, was fired off.[261] The town seems to have\r\npossessed only one of these weapons. At least, the soldiers of the\r\nguard who mounted over Gama after he had been arrested were not armed\r\nwith espingardas, but with swords, daggers, and bows,[262] and no\r\nmention is made of there being any cannon in the town.\r\n\r\nIn 1502 a sea-fight took place in these waters between a Portuguese\r\nman-of-war and a Moorish (Arab) ship, during which the Arab bore down\r\non the Portuguese, “pouring in her shot, and then made away.”[263]\r\nThe original says: “Una nube de flechas sobre nuestra gente y algunas\r\nbalas;” _i.e._ a cloud of arrows and some balls.[264] These balls were\r\nundoubtedly cannon balls.\r\n\r\nIt is stated in MSS. 826-8, _Bib. Nat._, Paris, that in 917 A.H. (A.D.\r\n1511-12) Modhaffer Shah of Gujarat sent to Kansuh, King of Egypt,\r\nasking him for arms and cannon to enable the Gujaratis to defend\r\nthemselves against the Europeans; “the people of India not having\r\nhitherto possessed Artillery of any kind.”[265] In answer to this\r\nrequest, Hossain was sent to sea in command of a considerable fleet.\r\nIf Mahmoud possessed ships with guns in 1482, how came it that in 1511\r\nthe Gujaratis were sending round the world begging for firearms? Had\r\nMahmoud merely hired for the occasion from the Arabs the ships and\r\nguns with which he crushed the Bulsar pirates? It is impossible to\r\nsay categorically; but two facts may be extracted from the foregoing\r\nconflicting statements—first, that firearms were used by Arab and\r\nPortuguese ships on the west coast of India before the Hindus possessed\r\nthem, and secondly, that there was an espingarda in the town of Calicut\r\nin 1498.\r\n\r\nWhatever doubt there may be about the exact date at which the natives\r\nof Western India first procured firearms from the foreign ships which\r\nvisited their shores, there can be none about the first employment of\r\nartillery in Upper India.\r\n\r\nAs has been already stated, the machines of the Greeks were adopted\r\nat an early period by the Persians, from whom they were eventually\r\nborrowed by the Arabs, Mughals, &c. The Hindus in turn adopted\r\nthe machines they saw employed by their invaders and named them,\r\naccording to their custom, after the part of the world they came\r\nfrom—_maghribíha_ = _western_ (machines or manjaník). At the abortive\r\nattack on Rantambhor, 1290, Sultan Jalalu-d Din ordered Westerns\r\nto be erected.[266] The Hindus had collected materials for making\r\nincendiaries before being besieged in the same fortress by Sultan\r\nAlau-d Din in 1300. “Every day the fire of those infernals fell on the\r\nlight of the Moslems, and, as there were no means of extinguishing it,\r\nthey filled bags with clay and prepared entrenchments.... The Royal\r\nWesterns shot large earthen balls against that infidel fort.... The\r\nstones from the ballistas and catapults within and without the fort\r\nencountered each other half-way and emitted lightening.”[267] During\r\nthe attack on Arangal, 1309, the Westerns “were played on both sides\r\nand many were wounded.”[268] The mud walls were so strong and elastic\r\nthat the balls of the Westerns rebounded off them “like nuts which\r\nchildren play with.”[269] Eventually the “western stone-balls” formed a\r\nbreach and the fort fell. Such is the account given by Amir Khusru who\r\ndied in 1315, of whom Sir H. M. Elliot says (vi. 465):—“He is full of\r\nillustrations and leaves no manner of doubt that nothing like gunpowder\r\nwas known to him.” Near the close of the century, 1398-9, the Hindus\r\nbesieged by Timur in Bhatnir “cast down in showers arrows and stones\r\nand fireworks upon the heads of the assailants.”[270] At the attack\r\non Chanderi, 1527-8, “the Pagans exerted themselves to the utmost,\r\nhurling down stones and throwing flaming substances on the heads”\r\nof Babar’s troops.[271] In 1528-9, the Hindus succeeded in igniting\r\nwith “fireworks, turpentine, and other combustibles” some hay which\r\nthe Mughals had collected in the fort of Lucknow. The heat became so\r\nintolerable that the Mughals retired and the fort was taken.[272]\r\n\r\nIt is needless to enlarge the list of quotations: incendiaries pursued\r\nmuch the same course in Upper India as in Greece and Arabia. No\r\nreliable evidence of an explosive is to be found until the 21st April\r\n1526, the date of the decisive battle of Panipat, in which Ibrahim,\r\nSultan of Delhi, was killed and his army routed by Babar, the Mughal,\r\nwho possessed firearms great and small.[273]\r\n\r\nOn the introduction of Artillery the word _maghribiha_ was gradually\r\nreplaced by the more definite word _feringiha_ = European. At Panipat\r\nthe Artillery of the left centre was commanded by Mustapha Rumi, whose\r\nname is sufficient proof of his western origin. But traces of European\r\nartisans are to be found long before this. When the King of Gor crossed\r\nthe Attok in the twelfth century, he had with him “skilful Franks,\r\nlearned in all the arts.”[274] The success of the attack on Chitor in\r\n1591, by Buhadur, Sultan of Gujarat, was chiefly due to his engineer,\r\nLabri Khan of Frengan = Frangistan, the country of the Franks.[275]\r\nSpeaking of the Mughal Artillery in 1695, Dr. Careri tells us that\r\nit was “all, especially the heavy Artillery, under the direction of\r\nFranks, or Christian gunners, who had extraordinary pay.”[276]\r\n\r\nHaidar Mirza gives us one or two details about Babar’s guns which\r\ndeserve a passing notice.[277] There was a _zarb-zan_, or swivel gun,\r\ncarrying a ball of 500 _miskals_, and a heavier gun throwing a “brass”\r\nball which weighed 5000 _miskals_, and cost 200 _miskals_ of silver.\r\nThe former was drawn by four, the latter by eight pairs of bullocks.\r\nLet us adopt the weight of the _miskal_ given in Steingass’ “Persian\r\nDictionary,”—1-3/7 drachms = 39.045 grs. troy, which makes the weight\r\nof Babar’s large ball 34 lbs. nearly.[278] Its price, 200 _miskals_,\r\nwould then be 7809 grs. troy of pure (silver), or (since our standard\r\nshilling is 87.27 grs. troy and its fineness 37/40) 96.7 shillings of\r\nour present money. The price of a 10.18 lbs. ball of the same material\r\nwould consequently be 29s., including the cost of manufacture. The\r\nprice of the English 4” bronze ball of 10.18 lbs. given here in Table\r\nX., is 26.468d., or about 22s. of our present money, exclusive of the\r\ncost of manufacture. Adding 7s. to cover the cost of manufacture,[279]\r\nits price would be about 29s. The value of the alloy in our shilling\r\nhas been neglected here, and Queen Elizabeth’s money may not have been\r\nworth exactly seven times our money; but making full allowance for both\r\nthese errors, the prices of the two balls approximate as closely as can\r\nbe reasonably expected.\r\n\r\nGunpowder was not invented by the Hindus: its discovery by them would\r\nhave fallen little short of a miracle. The extinction of Buddhism\r\nabout the ninth century A.D., and the consequent establishment of\r\na dominant priestly class, were a deathblow to the cultivation of\r\nphysical science. By the seemingly innocent institution of _caste_, the\r\nBrahmins succeeded in trampling science in the dust. One caste was not\r\npermitted to touch this, another caste could not touch that substance;\r\nand the higher the caste, the greater the number of forbidden objects.\r\nThe study of experimental science was consequently thrown back upon the\r\nlowest and poorest classes, who had neither the means, the leisure, nor\r\nthe inclination to pursue it. Thus “the spirit of inquiry gradually\r\ndied out,” says a Hindu Professor of Chemistry, “and the name of India\r\nwas all but expunged from the map of the scientific world.”[280]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE CHINESE\r\n\r\n\r\nChina, like India, affords an example of “arrested civilisation:”\r\nthe Chinese intellect and language became petrified while still\r\nin a primitive stage of development. But, unlike the Hindus, the\r\nChinese betook themselves at an early period to historical pursuits.\r\n“Debarred both by the nature of the material at their command and by\r\na lack of original genius from indulging in the higher branches of\r\nimaginative writing, Chinese authors devoted themselves with untiring\r\nenergy and with very considerable ability to the compilation of\r\ninformation concerning their own and neighbouring countries.”[281]\r\nAmong the results of their labours are the “Twenty-One Histories,”\r\nfrom the third century B.C. to the middle of the seventeenth century,\r\nsixty-six folio volumes, and a number of vast Encyclopædias, of which\r\nthe _Koo-kin-too-shoo_, &c., occupies 6109 volumes. From such immense\r\ncompilations and other sources Chinese scholars have supplied us with\r\nmuch information about the present subject.\r\n\r\nAlthough the invention of gunpowder is disclaimed for his countrymen\r\n“by every (Chinese) writer who treats seriously” on the subject,[282]\r\nthe people cherish the legend that the invention was made by a Chinaman\r\nin some forgotten past. The existence of this legend among a people\r\npossessed of a deep veneration for antiquity is in no way surprising.\r\nEvery Chinese custom, art, and institution is supposed to be very\r\nancient, and what is not really old is readily invested with fictitious\r\nantiquity. The world as we know it, they tell us, came into being\r\n2,670,000 years before Confucius, who was a contemporary of the prophet\r\nDaniel. “The more sober historians, however, are content to begin with\r\na sufficiently mythical Emperor, who reigned only 2800 years before the\r\nChristian era.”[283] This insatiable craving for antiquity is shown in\r\nall their works. “As with all other arts (the Chinese) have claimed for\r\nthe manufacture of porcelain an antiquity far beyond the actual facts\r\nof the case. This exaggerated estimate of the antiquity of Chinese\r\nporcelain was for a long time supported by the supposed discovery in\r\nEgypt of certain small bottles made of real porcelain and inscribed\r\nwith Chinese characters, which were said to have been found in tombs\r\nat Thebes, dating as early as 1800 B.C. The fact, however, that they\r\nare inscribed with quotations from Chinese poets of the eighth century\r\nA.D., and have characters of a comparatively modern form, shows that\r\nthe whole story of their discovery is a fraud.... During all periods\r\nChinese potters were constantly in the habit of copying earlier styles\r\nand of forging their marks, so that very little reliance can be placed\r\non internal evidence. Indeed, the forgeries often deceive the Chinese\r\ncollectors of old porcelain.”[284]\r\n\r\nAccording to the Jesuits, Chinese history is free from this defect.\r\nFather Moyria de Maillac (commonly called Mailla), in the long\r\nintroductions to his _Histoire générale de la Chine_, begs us to put\r\nour full trust in the Chinese historians, and pleads that, however\r\nmendacious the lower orders of the nation, the better classes love\r\nthe truth, and the historians are honest and accurate. But such pleas\r\nin bar of investigation and verification are of little weight unless\r\nit can be shown that Chinese historians never drew (in good faith)\r\nerroneous conclusions, never mistook the meaning of a document, were\r\nnever misinformed, and never made a slip in writing. As Gibbon clearly\r\nsaw,[285] the Jesuits were blinded by admiration of the Celestials;\r\ntheir sharp, critical sagacity was blunted by the air of sincerity\r\ndisplayed in Chinese books.[286] But this “accent de sincérité”\r\nis ruthlessly treated by MM. Langlois and Seignobos: “C’est une\r\nimpression presque irrésistible, mais elle n’en est pas moins une\r\nillusion. Il n’y a aucun critérium extérieur ni de la sincérité ni\r\nde l’exactitude. ‘L’accent de sincérité,’ c’est l’apparence de la\r\nconviction; un orateur, un acteur, un menteur d’habitude l’auront\r\nplus facilement en mentant qu’un homme indécis en disant ce qu’il\r\ncroit. La vigeur de l’affirmation ne prouve pas toujours la vigeur de\r\nla conviction, mais seulement l’habileté ou l’effronterie. De même\r\nl’abondance et la précision des détails, bien quelles fassent une\r\nvive impression sur les lecteurs inexpérimentés, ne garantissent pas\r\nl’exactitude des faits;[287] elles ne renseignent que sur l’imagination\r\nde l’auteur quand il est sincère ou sur son impudence quand il ne l’est\r\npas. On est porté de dire d’un récit circonstancié: ‘Des choses de ce\r\ngenre ne s’inventent pas.’ Elles ne s’inventent pas, mais elles se\r\ntransportent très facilement d’un personage, d’un pays ou d’un temps\r\nà un autre.—Aucun caractère extérieur d’un document ne dispense donc\r\nd’en faire la critique.”[288] In spite of their zeal for the truth,\r\nChinese historians are no more infallible than others, and it is\r\ncertain that they were unconsciously led into error at times by the\r\nchange in meaning which military words underwent in China as well as\r\nelsewhere. Thus\r\n\r\nMao-yiian-i erroneously believed that _huo-p’áu_ meant _cannon_ in old\r\ntimes, as it did in his own. But from a sketch he has fortunately given\r\nof one (reproduced by Romocki, i. 41) it is clear that it originally\r\nmeant a machine for scattering blazing incendiary matter.\r\n\r\nThe first two questions that present themselves are: (1) Did the\r\nChinese make use of gunpowder in a very distant past? and (2) did they\r\npossess an explosive shell in 1232?\r\n\r\nThe Chinese annals give no support to the hypothesis that gunpowder\r\nwas known in China in very early times. Currency was given to the\r\npopular legends about it by such writers as Father Gaubil, who\r\ndeclares that gunpowder had been in use for 1600 years when he\r\nwrote, and Father Amiot, who fully accepts a much earlier date. With\r\nreference to Koung-ming, who is said to have employed earth-thunder\r\n(_ty-lei_) about 200 A.D., Amiot says: (_a_) “Les auteurs qui parlent\r\nde Koung-ming ne le font pas l’inventeur de cette manière de nuire\r\nà l’ennemi. Ils disent, au contraire, qu’il l’avait puisée dans les\r\nouvrages des anciens guerriers; ce qui est une preuve sans réplique\r\nque les Chinois connaissaient la poudre à tirer ... bien longtemps\r\navant que cette connaissance fût parvenue en Europe.... (_b_) Les\r\nanciens Chinois employaient la poudre (_chen-ho-yen_), soit dans les\r\ncombats, soit pour mettre le feu au camp des ennemis.... (_c_) Cette\r\npoudre (_ny-foung-yo_) a une vertue qui, ce me semble, pourrait être\r\nd’une très grande utileté dans nos armées; c’est que la fumée va\r\négalement contre le vent.”[289] In (_a_) and (_c_) of these extracts\r\nthe true note of legend is audibly sounded, and the tacit assumption\r\nthat _ty-lei_ was an explosive is to be noted. As to (_b_), Amiot was\r\nunwittingly describing some early incendiary similar to that of Marcus\r\nGræcus, No. 2: “Ignis quæ comburit domos inimicorum.” Such is Father\r\nAmiot’s “preuve sans réplique” that the Chinese possessed gunpowder in\r\nthe times of the pre-adamite Sultans. It must be put aside; and with it\r\nmust be laid the evidence of Fathers Maillac and Gaubil. First, their\r\ncritical faculty became paralysed when dealing with Chinese history.\r\nSecondly, they evidently did not understand the difference between an\r\nexplosive and an incendiary. Thirdly, without questioning their good\r\nfaith, they are open to the charges brought against them by MM. Reinaud\r\nand Favé, when speaking of M. Quatremère’s dating Artillery in China\r\nat the thirteenth century: “(Il) ne s’est pas aperçu que PP. Mailla\r\net Gaubil avaient traduits différement certains passages des Annales\r\nchinoises, et qu’ils y avaient même ajouté tantôt des expressions de\r\nleur cru, et tantôt des interpolations de la version tartare-mandchou,\r\nversion qui date seulement d’un peu plus d’un siècle, et qui, par\r\nconsequent, n’a aucune autorité.”[290]\r\n\r\nHad the Chinese an explosive shell in 1232?\r\n\r\nThe following is a translation by M. Stanislas Julien of a passage\r\nin the Encyclopædia entitled _Tung-Chien-Kang-Mu_, relating to\r\nthe siege of Pien-king (now Kai-fung-fu) in 1232, given by Reinaud\r\nand Favé in the _Journal Asiatique_, Oct. 1849: “A cette époque on\r\nfaisait usage de _ho-pao_ ou _pao à feu_, appelée _Tchin-tien-louï_,\r\nou ‘tonnerre qui ébranle le ciel,’ On se servait pour cela d’un pot\r\nen fer que l’on remplissait de _yo_. A peine y avait-on mis le feu\r\nque le pao s’élevait, et que le feu éclatait de toute part. Son bruit\r\nressemblait à celui du tonnerre, et s’étendait à plus de cent _lis_\r\n(_i.e._ thirty-three English miles); il pouvait répandre l’incendie\r\nsur une surface de plus d’un demi-arpent (_i.e._ about one-third of an\r\nacre).... Les Mongols construisirent avec les peaux de bœuf un couloir\r\nqui leur permit d’arriver jusqu’an pied des remparts. Ils se mirent\r\nà saper les murs, et y pratiquèrent des cavités, où l’on pouvait se\r\nloger sans avoir rien à craindre des hommes placés en haut. Un des\r\nassiégés proposa de suspendre à des chaînes de fer des pao à feu, et de\r\nles descendre le long du mur. Arrivés aux endroits qui étaient minés,\r\nles pao éclataient et mettaient en pièces les ennemis et les peaux de\r\nbœuf, au point même de ne pas en laisser de vestige.” There is another\r\naccount of the shell in the _Wu-pei-chi_, published in 1621, but (as\r\none gathers from Mr. Mayers[291]) it is so similar in the details that\r\nthe two accounts cannot be taken as independent. They merely quote some\r\ncommon document or repeat some common tradition.\r\n\r\nLike the _Liber Ignium_ of Marcus Græcus, the _Tung-Chien-Kang-Mu_ is\r\nnot the work of one man or of one period. The original portions (the\r\n“Old Recipes” of Marcus) were written by Ssu-ma-kuang, 1019-86, and\r\nwere named _T’ung-Chien_, or the “Mirror of History,” by the reigning\r\nEmperor. The book was brought up to date by Chu-hsi, 1130-1200, and\r\nwas afterwards continued, with commentaries, by various writers, up\r\nto the seventeenth century. The above-quoted passage belongs to the\r\ncommentators,[292] and was written by some one whose date, name,\r\nand authority for his statement are alike unknown to us; but it was\r\npresumably written long after the event it records.\r\n\r\nWe have seen in Julien’s translation what the encyclopædist actually\r\nsays, but what meaning did he intend to convey by his words? Did\r\nhe mean to say the shell exploded? The passage may be divided into\r\ntwo clauses: in the first he explains generally the action of the\r\nho-pao, and in the second he gives a particular example of its use.\r\nIn the first clause he says that “no sooner was a light applied to it\r\nthan the fire burst forth on all sides” (_le feu éclatait de toute\r\npart_): in the second clause he says, “the pao burst forth” (_les pao\r\néclataient_). But the effect produced by the shell shows that this\r\nlatter phrase is simply an elliptical way of saying, “the fire of the\r\nmixture contained in the pao burst forth.” On this point Reinaud and\r\nFavé are clear: “_Les pao à feu éclataient_ s’applique aux éclats de\r\nla flamme qui sortait par les ouvertures,”[293]—holes in the shell\r\nwhich were probably numerous. Mayers agrees: the pao were lowered\r\ninto the excavations, “when the fire burst out from them, utterly\r\ndestroying every fragment of the hides,” &c.[294] The Chinese writer\r\nwas describing an incendiary, not an explosive. Gunpowder would have\r\nleft in the hiding-place of the Mongols a tangled mass of charred human\r\nremains and scorched cowhide: only an incendiary could have destroyed\r\nits contents so that “not a vestige remained.” Father Gaubil and M.\r\nBerthelot acquiesce in this conclusion:[295] Herr von Eomocki dissents\r\nfrom it.[296]\r\n\r\nThere is nothing in the military history of China in the thirteenth and\r\nfourteenth centuries to lead us to suppose that the Chinese possessed\r\nan explosive during that period. In 1255 Prince Hulágu had 1000 Chinese\r\narbalisters in his pay to work his incendiaries,[297] and it may be\r\npresumed that he would have learnt the secret of gunpowder from them\r\nif they had known it; but he possessed no explosive. Father Carpini,\r\n_cir._ 1250, states that when hard-pressed the Tartars had recourse to\r\nincendiaries, and Rashid ed-Din, in his history of Hulagu’s campaign\r\nof 1260, makes no allusion to explosives.[298] The Chinese had only\r\nreached the same stage as Marcus Græcus in 1257: in this year they\r\nhad Roman candles.[299] During the siege of Siang-yang-fu, 1268-73,\r\n“Khubelai sent to his nephew Abaka, in Persia, for engineers skilled\r\nin making catapults, called mangonals[300] by Marco Polo. Two such\r\nengineers were sent.”[301] We have three different notices of this\r\nsiege, Chinese, Persian, and Venetian, and “they all concur as to\r\nthe employment of foreign engineers from the West,”[302] but none of\r\nthem mentions the use of explosives by either side. “The Chinese at\r\nthat period,” says Sir John Davis, “were as little acquainted with\r\nfirearms as Europeans.”[303] When Chang-chi-ki’s fleet on the Kiang\r\nRiver was destroyed a few years afterwards by Atchu, it was by means of\r\nfire-arrows.[304] In a word, during the thirteenth century, the Chinese\r\nmade a free use of various incendiaries already noticed in the chapters\r\non the Greeks and Arabs; and they seem to have made no progress in the\r\nmanufacture of their missiles during the course of the fourteenth.[305]\r\nNot until we reach the fifteenth century do we meet with gunpowder and\r\ncannon.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Yen (afterwards the Emperor Yung Loh) is said to have\r\nbeen “defeated by firearms” at the battle of Tung Chang, 1401;[306]\r\nbut whether these arms were furnished with incendiaries or explosives\r\nis doubtful. The first trustworthy account of the use of artillery in\r\nChina is given in the _Kai-yii-tsung-kao_, published in 1790, by Chao\r\nI, a man of considerable ability, and an accomplished antiquarian. He\r\nstates that in the beginning of Yung Loh’s reign, 1407, cannon were\r\nacquired by the Emperor and employed during his campaigns in Cochin\r\nChina.[307] Whence came these cannon and their ammunition?\r\n\r\nIt is antecedently improbable that the Chinese either invented or\r\nmanufactured them; for although the Chinese exhibited considerable\r\nintellectual power in some fields of investigation, they possessed\r\nlittle genius for mechanical or chemical inventions, and what\r\nmechanical ability they had was absorbed in other pursuits. When\r\nactually possessed of powder, they seem to have been incapable of\r\nmaking any improvement in its manufacture. “Si la poudre de Chine\r\nvaut mieux que la nôtre,” says Father Incarville, the ablest of the\r\nJesuits I have consulted, “cela vien plutôt de la bonté des matières\r\nque du soin que les Chinois prennent de la faire bonne; ils la grainent\r\ntrès mal et ne savent pas la lisser.”[308] “Whatever their claims as\r\ninventors,” says another writer, “it is certain that the Chinese have\r\nmade no progress in the art” (of making gunpowder).[309] Even their\r\nfireworks were no better than European fireworks. They did not employ\r\nstars, and their largest rockets had a length of only five inches, with\r\nan internal diameter of eight lines.[310]\r\n\r\nThere is no trustworthy evidence, so far as I am aware, to prove that\r\nthe Chinese invented gunpowder. The statements of the Jesuits on this\r\nparticular matter are worthless for reasons already given,[311] and the\r\npopular Chinese tradition is deprived of any little weight it might\r\notherwise have had by the disavowal of the invention by sober Chinese\r\nhistorians. On the other hand, we possess a number of facts which point\r\nto the conclusion that the Chinese obtained their first gunpowder and\r\nfirearms from the West.\r\n\r\n  (_a_) It has been already pointed out that the mangonals\r\n  used at the siege of Siang-yang-fu, 1268-73, were of\r\n  western origin, and were worked by western engineers.\r\n\r\n  (_b_) The residence of the Polos in China, 1275-92, was\r\n  by no means an isolated fact. They were but the pioneers\r\n  of a considerable body of mechanics, missionaries, and\r\n  merchants who continued their relations with the country\r\n  for at least half a century.[312] It may be doubted\r\n  whether the merchants ever lost touch with China.\r\n\r\n  (_c_) Yung Loh, the first Chinese Emperor who possessed\r\n  _ts’iang_, or cannon, had agents in Malay, Delhi, Herat,\r\n  and Mecca,[313] and his agent in the latter city could\r\n  hardly have failed to hear of, and report on the use\r\n  of firearms in the West. If such were the case, there\r\n  was nothing to prevent the Emperor from obtaining small\r\n  guns by land, or guns of any size by sea. There had been\r\n  communication by land between China and Europe from the\r\n  time of the early Roman emperors of the West.[314] It was\r\n  seriously interrupted, no doubt, by the disorders which\r\n  broke out in China at the close of the ninth century, but\r\n  it was re-established when they came to an end in the\r\n  middle of the thirteenth.[315] Mr. F. Hirth proves in his\r\n  “China and the Roman Orient” that there was communication\r\n  by sea between China and Europe at a very early date.\r\n  Masudi speaks of the communication in his own time,\r\n  the tenth century. The Arab and Chinese ships met, he\r\n  says, at a port called Killat, half-way between Arabia\r\n  and China, where they transhipped their cargoes.[316]\r\n  There was constant communication between China and the\r\n  west coast of India in the first half of the fifteenth\r\n  century. Abd ur-Razzak says the men of Calicut were\r\n  bold navigators, and adds that they were called (in\r\n  compliment) “the sons of China.” When John Deza destroyed\r\n  the Zamorin’s fleet there, it was commanded by a\r\n  Chinaman, Cutiale.[317]\r\n\r\n  (_d_) The Chinese made their charcoal from young shoots\r\n  of the willow in the eighteenth century,[318] and “as\r\n  they seldom change anything,”[319] they probably did so\r\n  from the beginning. Twigs of willow are recommended for\r\n  this purpose by Roger Bacon and Hassan er-Rammah (pp.\r\n  149, 24.)\r\n\r\n  (_e_) The Chinese strained the mother-liquor of their\r\n  saltpetre through straw;[320] so also did Whitehorne (A.,\r\n  p. 20).\r\n\r\n  (_f_) They employed animal glue, or charcoal, to remove\r\n  the insoluble impurities of the mother-liquor,[321] just\r\n  as Bacon did, if the explanation of the word “Phœnix”\r\n  given in Chap. VIII. be accepted (p. 154).\r\n\r\n  (_g_) They incorporated the ingredients of gunpowder\r\n  on a _marble_ slab,[322] as directed by Marcus Græcus,\r\n  recipes 4 and 13, for incendiaries, and by Arderne for\r\n  gunpowder (p. 177).\r\n\r\n  (_h_) They passed their rocket composition through a\r\n  sieve of fine silk,[323] the counterpart of Arderne’s\r\n  “sotille couerchief” (Ib.).\r\n\r\n  (_i_) They occasionally added camphor and mercury to\r\n  their powder,[324] like Kyeser and many other westerns\r\n  (Romocki, i. 157).\r\n\r\n  (_j_) They called their powder _yo_, “the drug,” as did\r\n  the Germans, Danes, and Dutch (p. 6).\r\n\r\n  (_k_) They used varnishes,[325] of the same family as the\r\n  _lutum sapientiæ_, Marcus Græcus, recipe 1.\r\n\r\n  (_l_) An Encyclopædia, quoted in the _Pai-pien_, 1581,\r\n  states that “on the walls of Si-ngan there was long\r\n  preserved an iron _chen-tien-lui_ = heaven-shaking\r\n  thunderer, which in shape was like two cups”[326]—the\r\n  shell of Valturio (p. 221).\r\n\r\n  (_m_) Bits of metal, _mitraille_, were added to the\r\n  charge of Chinese shells,[327] after the manner\r\n  prescribed in a German Firebook (Romocki, i. 189).\r\n\r\n  (_n_) The shell were loaded with the _maximum_ charge\r\n  that could be rammed into them,[328] as directed in the\r\n  same Firebook (ib.).\r\n\r\n  (_o_) For repairing and closing the interstices of their\r\n  built-up bombards, the Chinese appear to have used the\r\n  same materials the Scotch used for Mons Meg; and it is\r\n  noticeable that the Chinese preferred “western iron” for\r\n  this purpose: “Ils emploient pour les confectionner du\r\n  cuivre rouge. Dans les interstices apparents, ceux qui\r\n  emploient du fer se servent de fer doux et malléable pour\r\n  consolider (ces machines). Le fer de l’Occident est le\r\n  meilleur qui puisse être employé à cet usage.”[329] In\r\n  the “Chronicles and Memorials of Scotland,” vol. vi., for\r\n  July 1459, we find: “For the repair of the great bombard\r\n  at Edinburgh, brass, copper and iron, _so much_” [_pro\r\n  expensis factis circa eandem emendacionem (magni bumbardi\r\n  ante castellum de Edinburgh) in ere, cupro et ferro_].\r\n\r\n  (_p_) In 1520 the heavy guns of the Portuguese ships\r\n  at Canton “attracted considerable attention, and soon\r\n  acquired the name of ‘Franks.’... The Chinese seem to\r\n  have subsequently availed themselves of the assistance of\r\n  the Portuguese, and of their wonderful guns, to punish\r\n  their own pirates”;[330] a circumstance which recalls\r\n  the expedition of Mahmoud of Gujarat against the Bulsar\r\n  pirates in 1482 (p. 116). These “Franks,” we learn from\r\n  the _Wu-pei-che_, “were of iron, 5 or 6 _ch’ih_ (6 or 7\r\n  ft.) long.... Five small barrels (chambers) were used,\r\n  which were placed (successively) inside the body of the\r\n  piece from which they were fired off.”[331]\r\n\r\n  (_q_) The Chinese guns manufactured in 1618 were cast\r\n  under the superintendence of the Jesuits at Peking.[332]\r\n\r\nThe general conclusion to be drawn from the foregoing inquiry is\r\nvirtually Gibbon’s, which may be expressed in somewhat firmer language\r\nthan he has used, since we possess many facts which were unknown to\r\nhim. It is highly probable that the invention of gunpowder was carried\r\nfrom the West to China, by land or water, at the end of the fourteenth\r\nor the beginning of the fifteenth century, and “was falsely adopted as\r\nan old national discovery before the arrival of the Portuguese and the\r\nJesuits in the sixteenth.”[333]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nFRIAR BACON\r\n\r\n\r\nRoger Bacon was born at Ilchester, in Somersetshire, in 1214, and died\r\nabout 1294. If the dedication be authentic, his _Epistola de Secretis\r\nOperibus Artis et Naturæ et de Nullitate Magiæ_, the work with which we\r\nare chiefly concerned here, was written before 1249.[334]\r\n\r\nBacon attacks Magic in this book on the ground that science and art can\r\nexhibit far greater wonders than the alleged wonders of the Black Art,\r\nand to prove his point he enumerates, in the first eight chapters, a\r\nnumber of wonders which (he believed) art could produce and magic could\r\nnot. Everything is sufficiently clear until we reach the ninth, tenth,\r\nand eleventh chapters, and they are unintelligible as they stand.\r\nNow, it is past belief that a man of commanding genius should have\r\ndeliberately stooped to write page after page of nonsense. The three\r\nchapters, therefore, must have _some_ meaning, hidden from us though it\r\nbe.[335]\r\n\r\nIt is unquestionable that Bacon believed he possessed secrets of\r\nvast importance. At the close of Chapter VIII. he tells us by way of\r\nwarning that he may resort (in the following chapters) to certain\r\ncryptic methods, “on account of the magnitude of his secrets” (_propter\r\nsecretorum magnitudinem_); and, fearing that ordinary cryptic methods\r\nmight be too transparent, he wraps up his secrets in an anagram in\r\nChapter XI.\r\n\r\nIf Bacon were in possession of such secrets, why, it may be asked, did\r\nhe not publish them openly? The reason was, as he explains repeatedly\r\nand at length, that he firmly believed scientific knowledge to be\r\nhurtful to the people. He protests in his works again and again against\r\nthe diffusion of scientific information. “The crowd,” he says, “is\r\nunable to digest scientific facts, which it scorns and misuses to its\r\nown detriment and that of the wise. Let not pearls, then, be thrown\r\nto swine.”[336] Elsewhere he says: “The mob scoff at philosophers and\r\ndespise scientific truth. If by chance they lay hold upon some great\r\nprinciple, they are sure to misinterpret and misapply it, so that what\r\nwould have been gain to every one causes loss to all.”[337] “It is\r\nmadness,” he goes on to say, “to commit a secret to writing, unless\r\nit be so done as to be unintelligible to the ignorant, and only just\r\nintelligible to the best educated”;[338] and so much in earnest was he\r\nupon this point that he enumerates seven methods of baffling public\r\ncuriosity. A secret may be concealed by making use of:—\r\n\r\n  (1) Symbols and incantations (_characteres et carmina_);\r\n\r\n  (2) Enigmatic and figurative words;\r\n\r\n  (3) Consonants only, without vowels;\r\n\r\n  (4) Letters from different alphabets;\r\n\r\n  (5) Specially devised letters;\r\n\r\n  (6) Prearranged geometric figures;\r\n\r\n  (7) Shorthand (_ars notatoria_).\r\n\r\nThese are among the means of veiling secrets, he tells us, and “ill\r\nwill it betide him who reveals them.”[339]\r\n\r\nBacon was not singular in holding the doctrine of secrecy in matters\r\nof science, nor was it peculiar to the age he lived in: it arose\r\nages before his birth, and was held for ages after his death. To\r\nany objections that might have been raised against the doctrine,\r\nphilosophers would probably have replied with Subtle and Mammon:—\r\n\r\n\r\n                “... was not all the knowledge\r\n  Of the Egyptians writ in mystic symbols?\r\n  Speak not the Scriptures oft in parables?\r\n  Are not the choicest fables of the poets,\r\n  That were the fountains and first springs of wisdom,\r\n  Wrapp’d in perpetual allegories?\r\n\r\n  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                      ... Sisyphus was damned\r\n  To roll the ceaseless stone, only because\r\n  He would have made Ours common.”[340]\r\n\r\nA man who boldly, even fiercely, avowed such opinions as Bacon’s, was\r\nbound in consistency to employ some cryptic method in recording his\r\nown secrets; and when we closely examine the course Bacon actually\r\nfollowed, we find that his practice was rigidly in accordance with his\r\ntheory—in fact, too rigidly. Those steeped in the Cabbala of Alchemy\r\nin his own age may have grasped his meaning, but to those who came\r\nafterwards it was obscure, if not hidden. Even to the early copyists\r\nof his MSS. it was unintelligible. In one of the MSS. consulted by\r\nProfessor Brewer, the scribe has written on the margin of Chap. IX. of\r\nthe _De Secretis_:—_Hæc sunt œnigmata_; “these things are enigmas,”\r\nand enigmas they have remained for seven centuries.\r\n\r\nThe presence of two anagrams in Chap. XI. is sufficient of itself to\r\narouse a suspicion that some cryptic method (of a different kind) has\r\nbeen employed in Chaps. IX. and X., and this suspicion is strengthened\r\nby their whole manner and diction. Their style is involved, and their\r\nmeaning (as they stand) unintelligible. Bacon passes from one subject\r\nto another in bewildering haste; from the unfinished description\r\nof one process to instructions about a second, which he leaves half\r\ntold in order to plunge into a third. Among directions of _seemingly_\r\nprimitive simplicity he interpolates such phrases as “catch my meaning\r\nif you can” (_intellige si potes_); “you will see whether I am\r\nspeaking riddles or the plain truth” (_videas utrum loquor œnigmata\r\naut secundum veritatem_); and he warns us that the purport of Chap.\r\nIX. may wholly escape us, unless we distinguish the (real from the\r\napparent) meaning of his statements (_in hoc capitulo decipieris, nisi\r\ndictionum significata, distinguas_). These special peculiarities of\r\nChaps. IX. and X. can be only explained by the use of some cryptic\r\nmethod, to which Bacon points plainly in Chap. VIII. He there names two\r\ncryptographers, Ethicus and Artephius, in connection with the seven\r\ncryptic methods already given, and he broadly hints that he may make\r\nuse of some of these methods (_forsan, propter secretorum magnitudinem,\r\naliquibus his utar modis_). It is needless to pursue the matter\r\nfurther: Chaps. IX. and X. are not, as they appear to be, nonsense, but\r\nthe cryptic exposition of some secret which Bacon believed to be of\r\ngreat value.\r\n\r\nFew of the difficulties we experience in investigating the meaning of\r\nthese three chapters were felt by the correspondent to whom the Friar\r\naddressed them as letters. He and Bacon had long been in communication\r\nwith each other, and as both knew the substance which formed the _real_\r\nsubject of these letters, Bacon was at liberty to call it chalk\r\nor cheese or what he willed. They appear to have had some system\r\nof numerical signs, the meaning of which is lost to us. The tenth\r\nchapter begins with a reference to a letter received by Bacon from\r\nhis correspondent in the year 602 A.H., and as the date is given in\r\nwords, not figures, it can hardly have been mistaken by the scribes.\r\nNow the year 602 A.H. began on 18th Aug., 1205 A.D., nine years before\r\nBacon was born. The number 602, therefore, is either a blind, or a\r\nconventional sign or key. The same may be said of the number 630 in the\r\nfirst line of Chap. XI., and of the totally unnecessary 30 which occurs\r\njust before the anagram in the same chapter—“(_sit_) pondus totum\r\n30,” _i.e._ let the total weight be 30. No one can have ever wanted to\r\nknow the total weight of the mixture in question: every one wanted to\r\nknow the proportions of the ingredients. Our ignorance of these signs\r\ncreates difficulties for us which did not exist for the initiated in\r\nBacon’s time.\r\n\r\nAs will be shown hereafter, Bacon has occasionally availed himself\r\nin Chaps. IX., X., and XI. of Nos. 2 and 4 of the cryptic methods he\r\nhas given us; but these methods apply only to words and phrases, and\r\nthe wily Franciscan did not think it necessary to allude to the more\r\ngeneral method by which he set forth so much of his statement as is\r\ncontained in Chaps. IX. and X. We cannot discuss cryptograms here:\r\nsuffice it to say that some of the early methods were too tedious and\r\nsome too complicated to be employed throughout the whole length of\r\nChaps. IX. and X. The method he appears to have adopted (as the result\r\nwill show) was that known long afterwards as the “Argyle cipher,” of\r\nwhich the following letter from Thackeray’s “Esmond” is an example. The\r\nreal contents of this letter are the phrases within brackets:—\r\n\r\n“[_The King will take_] medicine on Thursday. His Majesty is better\r\nthan he hath been of late, though incommoded by indigestion from\r\nhis too great appetite. Madame Maintenon continues well. They have\r\nperformed a play of Mons. Racine at St. Cyr.... [_The Viscount\r\nCastlewood’s passports_] were refused to him, ’twas said; his lordship\r\nbeing sued by a goldsmith for _Vaisselle plate_ and a pearl necklace\r\nsupplied to Mademoiselle Meruel of the French Comedy. ’Tis a pity\r\nsuch news should get abroad [_and travel to England_] about our young\r\nnobility here. Mademoiselle Meruel has been sent to Fort l’Evesque;\r\nthey say she ordered not only plate, but furniture, and a carriage and\r\nhorses [_under that lords name_], of which extravagance his unfortunate\r\nViscountess knows nothing.\r\n\r\n“[_His Majesty will be_] eighty-two years of age on his next\r\nbirthday.... All here admired my Lord Viscount’s portrait, and said\r\nit was a masterpiece of Rigaud. Have you seen it? It is [_at the Lady\r\nCastlewood’s house in Kensington Square_]. I think no English painter\r\ncould produce such a piece.\r\n\r\n“Our poor friend the Abbé hath been to the Conciergerie [_where his\r\nfriends may visit him_. _They are to ask for_] a remission of his\r\nsentence soon.\r\n\r\n“[_The Lord Castlewood_] has had the affair of the plate made up and\r\ndeparts for England.\r\n\r\n“Is not this a dull letter?...”—Bk. III. Chap. 8.\r\n\r\nThis letter shows very clearly that the Argyle steganogram is one\r\nwhich it is almost impossible to solve without the key, unless the\r\nmatter to which it relates is known beforehand[341]—a difficulty to\r\nwhich Bacon’s correspondent was not exposed, for he knew well what\r\nthe subject of Bacon’s communication would be. Here, then, we should\r\nhave found ourselves left in utter darkness were it not for a ray of\r\nlight afforded by Chap. XI. There we are told that _something_, in\r\nconnection with saltpetre and sulphur, produces an explosion,[342]\r\nand we know that this _something_ is charcoal. Since Chap. XI. is\r\nconcerned with the composition and effects of this mixture, what more\r\nprobable than that Chaps. IX. and X. should deal with its ingredients\r\nseparately—or at least with saltpetre and charcoal, for sulphur was\r\nso simple and common a drug that Bacon was not likely to dwell upon\r\nit? Now, towards the end of Chap. X. Bacon speaks without disguise\r\nof charcoal under the name of the wood from which it is made,[343]\r\nand mentions the two trees, hazel and willow, which give the best. He\r\nsignificantly adds that when charcoal is added to proper proportions\r\nof certain other substances, something noteworthy happens (_si vero\r\npartes virgulti coryli aut salicis multarum justâ rerum serie apte\r\nordinaveris, unionem naturalem servabunt: et hoc non tradas oblivioni,\r\nquia valet ad multa_). Since, then, charcoal is one of the subjects of\r\nthese two chapters, it becomes all the more probable that saltpetre\r\nforms another. Bacon was writing but a few years after its discovery,\r\nand nothing could be more natural than that the great alchemist should\r\nbestow his attention upon the preparation of the new salt. This\r\nhypothesis explains simply and completely the most remarkable feature\r\nof Chaps. IX. and X.—the series of common and well-known alchemical\r\nterms and phrases, referring undoubtedly to the preparation of either\r\nsaltpetre or gold, which are scattered and hidden among incoherent\r\nmaunderings about chalk and cheese, philosophic eggs and Tagus sand,\r\nAdam’s bones and aperient medicine. But how could the preparation of\r\ngold lead up to the recipe for an explosive with which Chap. XI. ends?\r\nThere is no connection whatever between gold and gunpowder, while the\r\nconnection between saltpetre and gunpowder is of the closest possible\r\nkind. Before giving a recipe for gunpowder it was absolutely necessary\r\nfor Bacon to describe the method of refining the lately discovered\r\nsaltpetre, without which his recipe would have been worthless; and\r\nhe took advantage of the close similarity between the alchemical\r\npreparation of gold and the refining of saltpetre to conceal the real\r\nimport of his tract. By the title of the last three chapters—“On the\r\nMethod of Making the Philosopher’s Stone”—and by constantly harping\r\non gold, he endeavoured to distract and deceive his ordinary readers,\r\nleading them to believe that he was writing about gold when he was\r\nreally treating on saltpetre.\r\n\r\nThe unnamed substance saltpetre, then, is the principal subject of\r\nChaps. IX. and X., and our course is clear. We must treat these\r\nchapters as we should treat Col. Esmond’s letter were the brackets\r\nomitted[344]-we must make shift to insert them. We must bracket\r\ntogether the phrases and sentences relating to the real subject of\r\nthese chapters, the familiar alchemical expressions relating to\r\nsaltpetre. On doing so we shall find a connected and rational method of\r\nrefining the salt.\r\n\r\nIn the following reproduction of Chaps. IX. and X. I have used the\r\nEsmond brackets, but I have not thought it necessary to reprint _all_\r\nthe padding which connects them. All omissions, however, are shown\r\nby dots. No word of the bracketed phrases has been changed, altered,\r\nadded, or suppressed, nor has the order of the words been altered.\r\nNothing has been done but to indicate by brackets the misleading\r\ninterpolations.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAP.

Whatever errors may be found,\r\nthere can at least be little doubt that the occult meaning of the two\r\nchapters is the refining of saltpetre. One sentence, two sentences,\r\nor even more, might be selected from the description of almost any\r\nlong chemical process which would apply with equal propriety to some\r\nother process; but it is incredible that a long, varied, and connected\r\nprocess, such as the refining of saltpetre, could be extracted by any\r\nmethod from documents professedly devoted to the philosopher’s stone,\r\nunless this process had been designedly inserted there, piecemeal or\r\nwhole, by the author himself. For the figurative interpretation given\r\nof two or three words and phrases, we have Bacon’s own warrant. He\r\nthreatened to employ _verba œnigmatica_ and _verba figurativa_, and he\r\nhas been taken at his word; with the result that a rational chemical\r\nprocess has been extracted from what was previously unintelligible.\r\n\r\nHaving said all he had to say about the ingredients, Bacon proceeds to\r\ndeal with their mixture in Chap. XI., in which he employs a cryptic\r\nmethod without disguise:—\r\n\r\n\r\nCAP. XI.\r\n\r\n_De eodem, tamen alio modo._\r\n\r\nAnnis Arabum 630 transactis, petitioni tuæ respondeo in hunc modum....\r\nItem pondus totum 30. Sed tamen salis petræ[370] LURU VOPO VIR CAN\r\nUTRIET sulphuris; et sic facies tonitruum et coriscationem, si scias\r\nartificium. Videas tamen utrum loquor œnigmatate aut secundum veritatem.\r\n\r\nOmitting the anagram, the translation is:—“In this 630th year of the\r\nHigira I comply with your request as follows.... Let the total weight\r\n(of the ingredients) be 30. However, of saltpetre ... of sulphur; and\r\nwith such a mixture you will produce a bright flash and a thundering\r\nnoise, if you know ‘the trick.’ You may find (by actual experiment)\r\nwhether I am writing riddles to you or the plain truth.”\r\n\r\nThe mention of the flash and the noise indicates at once that we have\r\nhere to do with an explosive. But saltpetre and sulphur when mixed\r\ntogether do not form an explosive. We may feel sure, therefore, that\r\nthe name of the one substance necessary to convert the incendiary\r\nmixture of saltpetre and sulphur into an explosive, namely charcoal,\r\nis included under some form in the anagram—either as _carbo_, or the\r\nname of the wood from which it is made. The _et sic facies_ of the\r\nsecond clause shows that there must necessarily be in the first clause,\r\nand consequently in the anagram, some verb in the imperative mood,\r\nsuch as _mix_ or _take_. We may expect a word for a weight (_libræ_,\r\n_unciæ_, &c.), or the word _partes_. As regards the proportions, the\r\nearliest we are acquainted with approximate more or less closely\r\nto 2:1:1, Arderne’s recipe being merely a laboratory recipe. The\r\nproportions of the ingredients, therefore, if included in the anagram,\r\nwill probably not differ much from 2:1:1.\r\n\r\nRearranging the letters of the anagram, we get—\r\n\r\n  RVIIPARTVNOUCORULVET,\r\n\r\nor since U and V are interchangeable,\r\n\r\n  R. VII PART. V NOV. CORUL. V ET; _i.e._\r\n  r(ecipe) vii part(es), v nov(ellæ)[371] corul (i), v et.\r\n\r\nThe whole passage in the original therefore reads:—\r\n\r\n  “sed tamen salis petræ recipe vii partes, v novellæ\r\n      coruli, v et sulphuris,” &c.; that is—\r\n  “but take 7 parts of saltpetre, 5 of young hazel-wood,\r\n      and 5 of sulphur,” &c.;\r\n  _i.e._ 1-2/5 sp., 1 char. and 1 sulph.\r\n\r\n_R._ was the common contraction for _recipe_, and may be seen in Marcus\r\nGræcus’ first recipe (Berthelot’s text). _Nov._ _Corul._ could have\r\npresented no difficulty to Bacon’s correspondent, seeing that in the\r\nprevious letter, Cap. X., Bacon had spoken of _virgulti coryli_. There\r\nhe writes _coryli_: in his _Opus Majus_ he wrote _coruli_ (ii. 219,\r\nBridges ed.).\r\n\r\nThe second anagram (in Greek, Roman, and Anglo-Saxon letters) seems to\r\nbe a note to the first and need not detain us, since we have already\r\ngot the names and proportions of the ingredients.\r\n\r\nIn deference to those readers who may reject the preceding attempts to\r\nread Bacon’s riddles, we now proceed to show, on grounds independent\r\nof the steganogram and anagram, that Bacon was in possession of an\r\nexplosive.\r\n\r\nThe igneous bodies of which Bacon speaks fall into two classes. The\r\nfirst class are incendiaries. “Incendiaries,” he tells us, “may be\r\nmade from saltpetre, or petroleum, or maltha,[372] or naphtha, mixed\r\nwith other substances.... To these are allied Greek fire and many\r\nother incendiaries[373].... (Burning) maltha, if thrown upon an armed\r\nsoldier, will cause his death.... It is difficult to extinguish, water\r\nbeing useless for this purpose.”[374]\r\n\r\nBut side by side with these passages we find descriptions of igneous\r\ncompositions of a totally different kind. “There are other natural\r\nwonders. We can produce in the air sounds loud as thunder and flashes\r\nbright as lightning—nay, even surpassing the powers of nature. A small\r\nquantity of (a certain) composition, no bigger than one’s thumb, will\r\ngive forth (on ignition) a deafening noise and a vivid flash.”[375] We\r\nhave, too, the passage, already quoted, in the eleventh chapter, where\r\nhe says that saltpetre and sulphur and _something else_ give forth (on\r\nignition) “a thundering noise and a vivid flash.”[376] Again: “Some\r\ncompositions (when ignited) make an unbearable noise.... No other sound\r\ncan be compared with it. Others produce flashes more fearful to behold\r\nthan real lightning.... We may exemplify these effects with a child’s\r\ntoy which contains within it a quantity of saltpetre (mixture) the size\r\nof one’s thumb. In the bursting of this bauble, made only of parchment,\r\nthere are given forth a noise louder than the mutterings of thunder\r\nand a flash brighter than the brightest lightning.”[377] It will be\r\nevident on a moment’s consideration that the charge of this toy must\r\nhave been an explosive. Had it been an incendiary, the paper would\r\nhave taken fire long before the pressure of the gases generated by the\r\ncombustion had increased sufficiently to burst the case, and there\r\nwould have been no loud report.\r\n\r\nThe consequences of igniting these two classes of composition are\r\ndescribed so clearly as to preclude all possible misunderstanding:—the\r\nincendiary _burns_ fiercely, while the other mixture gives forth\r\n_a bright flash and a loud noise_. In the latter case, Bacon was\r\ndescribing an explosion, and, as he has elsewhere spoken of saltpetre,\r\ncharcoal, and sulphur, the reasonable conclusion is that the explosive\r\nwas gunpowder.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the first of the foregoing passages—“there are\r\nother natural wonders,” &c.—describes a rocket. As everybody knows, a\r\nrocket in its flight makes a whizzing noise and is followed by a trail\r\nof heated gas and sparks. The whizzing noise can only be compared to\r\nthunder by a total disregard of fact, for no sound resembles thunder\r\nless. Does thunder whizz? The fiery trail can only be called a flash\r\nby an equal disregard of fact: it gives a continuous light. But if\r\nthe rocket carries a bursting charge which explodes in mid-air, the\r\nexplosion may, with venial exaggeration, be said to produce a flash\r\nlike lightning and a noise like thunder. Bacon was alluding to a\r\nbursting charge consisting of an explosive, and that explosive was\r\ngunpowder.\r\n\r\nWas Bacon aware of the projective force of gunpowder? There is nothing\r\nin his works (so far as I am acquainted with them) which suggests that\r\nhe was. He knew that gunpowder exploded, and he believed that an army\r\nmight be either actually blown up by it, or put to flight by the terror\r\ninspired by its explosion;[378] but he seems to have gone no further.\r\nHe experimented, probably, with very small quantities of it; and the\r\nbehaviour of gunpowder when fired in large quantities under pressure is\r\nso unlike its behaviour when fired in small quantities in the open air,\r\nthat its projective force could neither have been predicted by abstract\r\nreasoning nor realised by even his powerful imagination.\r\n\r\nIf a surmise be permissible, Bacon did not invent, he discovered\r\ngunpowder. Experimenting with some incendiary composition, prepared\r\nwith pure instead of impure saltpetre, the mixture exploded\r\nunexpectedly and shattered all the chemical apparatus near it, thereby\r\nlaying the foundation of the mediæval legend about the destruction of\r\nthe Brazen Head. This suggestion, if correct, only adds one more item\r\nto the long list of accidental discoveries. The laws of the structure\r\nof crystals were discovered by Haüy’s accidentally letting fall a piece\r\nof calc-spar, which broke into fragments. Malus, chancing to look\r\nthrough a double refracting prism at the light of the setting sun,\r\nreflected from the windows of the Luxembourg Palace, discovered the\r\npolarisation of light. Galvani discovered galvanism by mere accident.\r\nThe decomposition of water by voltaic electricity was accidentally\r\ndiscovered by Nicholson in 1801.\r\n\r\nHowever, whether as discoverer or inventor, Roger Bacon made and fired\r\nthe first gunpowder. It fell to the lot of a persecuted English monk to\r\nfulfil the prophecy of Prometheus, that in the latter day there should\r\nappear “a wondrous being, who should call forth flashes brighter than\r\nlightning and sounds louder than thunder.”[379]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\nTHE PROGRESS OF AMMUNITION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nANALYTICAL TABLE OF AMMUNITION\r\n\r\n\r\nTo those who are not professional gunners, Artillery ammunition may\r\nseem at the first glance to be a hopeless and chaotic jumble of endless\r\nstores. This is no doubt partly owing to the necessary multiplicity of\r\nthe stores, but far more to the absence (in most books and lists) of\r\nany synoptic digest, or plan, showing at one view the classification\r\nof the whole and the pedigree of each article. To remedy this want the\r\nfollowing table has been drawn out, showing the stems to which belong\r\nthe various kinds of ammunition we are concerned with here. Many trees\r\nof a somewhat similar nature might of course be constructed, fuller and\r\nmore scientific than Table IV.; but it has the advantage of being very\r\nsimple and sufficiently comprehensive for the present purpose.\r\n\r\nStrictly speaking, the table ought to have included _all_ the\r\nammunition in use between the introduction of cannon and the\r\nintroduction of rifled arms in the middle of the last century; but\r\nthe principle has not been pushed to its limit, nor was it necessary\r\nto do so in order to enable the reader to form a clear notion of the\r\nbroad divisions of ammunition. Machines lingered on for some time\r\nafter the invention of cannon: in fact they were used at the siege of\r\nConstantinople in 1453. Their stone balls and pots of Greek fire are\r\nnot formally included, because what is said of stone shot for guns in\r\nChap. XIII. applies equally to stone balls for machines, and all that\r\nit was considered necessary to say about Greek fire has been said in\r\nChap. III. Electric fuzes, and some few species of ammunition of little\r\ninterest or value, have been also omitted, because their inclusion\r\nwould have increased the size and complexity of the table without any\r\ncounterbalancing advantage.\r\n\r\nAmmunition for rifled guns has not been included, because it is for the\r\nmost part an adaptation and development of smooth-bore ammunition.\r\n\r\nTABLE IV\r\n\r\n                                                         ┌ Fire Arrows, &c.\r\n              ┌ Hand ────────────────────────────────────│ Grenades, Incend. and\r\n              │                                          └ Explos.\r\n              │\r\n              │ Automatic ───────────────────────────────[ Rockets, War\r\n              │\r\n              │          ┌ Charge ───────────────────────[ Gunpowder\r\n              │          │\r\n              │          │                       ┌         Darts, &tc.\r\n              │          │                       │       ┌ Stone\r\n              │          │                       │ Round │ Iron\r\n              │ Cannon ─ │              ┌ Shock ─│ Shot  │ Bronze\r\n              │          │              │        │       └ Lead\r\n              │          │              │        │         Case\r\n              │          │              │        └         Sharapnel\r\n              │          │              │\r\n              │          └ Projectiles ─│                ┌ Hot Shot\r\n  AMMUNITION ─│                         │ Incendiary ────│ Fireballs\r\n              │                         │                │ Shell\r\n              │                         │                └ Carcasses\r\n              │                         │                ┌\r\n              │                         └ Explosive ─────│ Fireballs\r\n              │                                          └ Shell\r\n              │\r\n              │                                  ┌         Hot Wires\r\n              │                                  │         Priming Powder\r\n              │                                  │         Matches, Slow and Quick\r\n              │ Igniters ────────────────────────│         Portfires\r\n              │                                  │       ┌ Tubes\r\n              │                                  │ Fuzes │ Time\r\n              │                                  │       │ Percussion\r\n              │                                  └       └ Concussion\r\n              │                                          ┌\r\n              └ Signals ─────────────────────────────────│ Rockets\r\n                                                         └ Fixed Lights\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nHAND AMMUNITION\r\n\r\n  _Fire-Arrows and Fire-Pikes_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe system of attaching incendiaries to arrows, lances, &c., survived\r\nthe introduction of gunpowder and died a lingering death. In November\r\n1588 the Government ordered the purchase of “20 Slurr Bows at 25s.\r\neach, and 20 doz. of firework arrows for the said slurr bows at 5s.\r\nthe doz.”[380] From a list of naval stores for the year 1599, it would\r\nappear that fire-arrows were discharged from long-bows as well as\r\nslur-bows:—\r\n\r\n  “Slurbowe arrowes with firewoorkes, 184;\r\n          inde 19 without firewoorkes.\r\n   Longbowe arrowes with firewoorkes, 4 shef. 1 arr.”[381]\r\n\r\nHansard gives a plate of an English archer, 1250, with _spicula\r\nignita_, or arrow tipped with wildfire.[382] Sir R. W. Payne-Gallwey\r\ngives a sketch of a slur-bow. It is a cross-bow, with a barrel and\r\na single string which works in two slits cut in the sides of the\r\nbarrel.[383]\r\n\r\nFire-lances were used, perhaps for the last time, at the first siege\r\nof Bristol, 1643. There, Prince Rupert tells us, “Captain Clerk,\r\nAncient Hodgkinson, and some others running in upon (the Royalists)\r\nwith fire-pikes, neither men nor horses were able to endure it. The\r\nfire-pikes did the feat.”[384]\r\n\r\nFire-arrows had a longer spell of existence, and were used by the\r\nChinese against the French in 1860.[385]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hand Grenades_\r\n\r\nIncendiary hand grenades are of great antiquity. We have seen that\r\nearthenware grenades were used at the siege of Salonika,[386] 904.\r\nTowards the end of the thirteenth century Hassan er-Rammah describes\r\ngrenades made of bark, papyrus, or glass—materials well adapted to\r\nbreak up on impact and scatter about their burning contents.[387]\r\nThey were used at the passage of the Lys in 1382:—“Adonc vinrent\r\narbalêtriers et gens de pied avant; et si en y avait aucuns qui jetait\r\nde bombardes portatives et qui traioient grands quarriaulx empennés de\r\nfer,” &c.[388] By a common figure of speech Froissart calls the grenade\r\na bombard, just as the author of the “Avowing of Arthur” calls a shot a\r\ngun:—\r\n\r\n   “... there came fliand a gunne\r\n  And lemet as the leuyn....”[389]\r\n  (A gun came flying by and gleamed like lightning.)\r\n\r\nThe plate from the MS. of Kyeser’s _Bellifortis_, 1405, given by Herr\r\nvon Romocki (i. 169), shows three projectiles which were unquestionably\r\nhand grenades. Figs. 25 and 30 are provided with spikes, like\r\ncrow’s-feet.[390] Fig. 27 is a flask or bottle of the same family as\r\nHassan’s grenades, and was probably made of earthenware. It was by\r\nan explosive earthenware grenade that Del Vasto was severely wounded\r\nin 1528, during the sea-fight between the French and Spaniards off\r\nCape Campanella.[391] The Comte de Rendan was killed by a grenade of\r\nunknown construction at the siege of Rouen, 1562,[392] and grenades\r\nwere freely used at the siege of Famagusta, 1572. Du Bellay tells us\r\nthat grenades were made in large quantities at Arles in 1536.[393] As\r\nit is improbable that iron grenades could have been turned out in large\r\nquantities in the first half of the sixteenth century, we may conclude\r\nthat they were either earthenware or some form of brittle brass. This\r\nis rendered probable by Whitehorne’s remarks on the subject. He says\r\nthat “earthen bottles or pottes,” filled with incendiary or explosive\r\nmatter, had been formerly used; but he recommends “hollow balles of\r\nmetal, as bigge as smal boules and ¼ in. thick, cast in mouldes and\r\nmade of 3 partes of brasse and 1 of tinne.” Their charge consisted of\r\n“3 partes serpentine, 3 partes fine corne pouder, and 1 part rosen.”\r\nA little fine corned powder was used as priming; and he directs the\r\ngrenades to be “quickly thrown,” as they will almost immediately\r\n“breake and flye into a thousand pieces.” The want of a proper fuze\r\nrendered their use so dangerous that he advises trials to be made with\r\nthem, “to see how long they will tarry before they breake.”[394]\r\n\r\nMajor Ralph Adye mentions that grenades were supposed to be capable of\r\nbeing thrown 13 fathoms, or 26 yards.[395]\r\n\r\nEvelyn says in his “Diary” that on 29th June 1678, he saw at the\r\nHounslow Camp certain soldiers “called granadiers, who were dexterous\r\nin flinging hand-granades.” In the _Archæological Journal_, xxiii.,\r\n22, will be found a plate “Blow your Match,” after a sketch by Lens,\r\n“limner to His Majesty” George II., which represents a grenadier of the\r\n1st Regiment of the Guards in 1735, grenade in hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nWAR ROCKETS\r\n\r\n\r\nIncendiary rockets were known in the East from an early time, and they\r\nare frequently mentioned at later periods; but we are told so little\r\nabout the loss they inflicted upon an enemy that one is inclined to\r\nsuspect their effect was confined to wounding a few men and frightening\r\nelephants and horses. They are said to have been used by the Chinese\r\nagainst the Tatars in 1232.[396] The _Malzufat-i Timuri_ and the\r\n_Zafarnama_ leave us in doubt whether Timur’s rockets were used or\r\nnot at the great battle of Delhi, 1399.[397] The effect produced by\r\na single rocket led to the fall of the strong fort of Bitar in 1657,\r\nbut this result was purely accidental. The commander of the fort,\r\nforeseeing that an assault would be made upon one of the bastions\r\nwhich had been much damaged by artillery fire, ordered a hole to be\r\ndug in it and filled with gunpowder, grenades, &c., intending to\r\nblow up the besiegers when they entered. Just before the assault was\r\nmade, one of the besiegers’ rockets fell by accident into this pit\r\nand fired its contents, creating thereby so much loss and confusion\r\namong the garrison that the place was carried after a short struggle by\r\nAurangzeb’s troops.[398]\r\n\r\nIn the West, rockets were employed as early as 1380,[399] if not\r\nearlier; but they were never looked on with favour, and they appear\r\nto have been seldom, if ever, used between the earlier part of the\r\nfifteenth century and our bombardment of Boulogne with Congreve rockets\r\nin 1806. Dunois’ capture of Pont Audemer in 1449 was a consequence of\r\na fire that broke out in the town; but the fire appears to have been\r\ncaused by a hand-grenade or fire-arrow, not by a rocket. However, the\r\nexact meaning of the word _fusus_ is so doubtful that the matter is not\r\nworth pursuing.[400]\r\n\r\nTowards the close of the eighteenth century rockets were almost\r\nforgotten in the one European city where they were most likely to have\r\nbeen remembered—Constantinople. In 1783-84 Tipu Sultan sent a mission\r\nto the Sultan of Turkey, and of the presents which they offered “none\r\nwere so much admired as the Rockets, of which there were none in that\r\ncountry.”[401]\r\n\r\nWe find traces of the employment of rockets, both incendiary and\r\nexplosive, in India in this very year, when some “rocketeers ... threw\r\nconfusion and dispersion into the masses of the Mahrattas.”[402]\r\nNothing can be more probable: the army of the Mahrattas was an army\r\nof cavalry, and horses are terrified by fire in any form. The Indian\r\nrocket at this time had a tube of 8” length and 1.5” diameter,[403] and\r\nit does not appear to have been a very effective missile. Speaking of\r\nour loss during the attack on Seringapatam, 1792, Colonel Dirom says:\r\n“(We had) a good many wounded, though in general but slightly, chiefly\r\nby rockets.”[404] Within the next few years, however, rockets were\r\nmuch improved, and an eye-witness speaks of the use of “rockets of an\r\nuncommon weight” at the siege of Seringapatam, 1799.[405] These were\r\nundoubtedly explosive rockets, for Col. Gerrard saw one of them kill\r\nthree and wound four of our men.[406]\r\n\r\nShortly after the taking of Seringapatam the Ordnance Office applied\r\nto the Laboratory, Woolwich Arsenal, for the services of some one who\r\nunderstood the manufacture of war rockets. The Laboratory referred\r\nthe Ordnance to the East India Company, who replied that they knew\r\nof no one who possessed such knowledge.[407] This state of things\r\nled Colonel Congreve to turn his attention to the subject. It is not\r\ncorrect to say that he brought rockets from India,[408] for he never\r\nwas there. He knew of course—the whole world knew—that war rockets\r\nwere employed there: “I knew that rockets were used for military\r\npurposes in India, but that their magnitude was inconsiderable and\r\ntheir range not exceeding 1000 yards.”[409] His object was to make\r\nlarge incendiary and explosive rockets with a range of 1000-3500 yards,\r\nand he succeeded, perhaps, as well as the materials at his disposal\r\npermitted. He never laid claim to the invention of war rockets: “What\r\nI have done,” he says, “towards the perfection of this weapon is as\r\nmuch my own as if the original invention of rockets in general were\r\nmine.”[410]\r\n\r\nOberst-Lieutenant Jähns tells us that, from a certain point of\r\nview, the Emperor Caligula’s rockets were on a level with those of\r\nCongreve.[411] It may be doubted, however, whether Caligula’s rockets\r\nwould have produced the same effect as the Congreve rockets at\r\nCopenhagen in 1807,[412] or at Walcheren in the same year, when the\r\nFrench Commandant, General Monnet, protested against their use. They\r\ndid good service at the passage of the Adour in 1813, and at the battle\r\nof Leipsig, where Captain Bogue, who commanded the Rocket Brigade,\r\nwas killed. A French infantry brigade in the village of Paunsdorf,\r\n“unable to withstand the well-directed fire (of rockets), fell into\r\nconfusion, began to retreat,” and ultimately surrendered to the Rocket\r\nBrigade.[413] Two years afterwards, at Waterloo, the rockets, under\r\nSergeant Daniel Dunnett, proved very effective.\r\n\r\nOf late years rockets have fallen into disrepute everywhere, owing to\r\nradical defects explained by Captain C. O. Browne, R.A.;[414] and their\r\nuse is unlikely to be revived until the chemists make some unforeseen\r\nand astonishing discovery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nGUNPOWDER\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE oldest recipe for gunpowder is Roger Bacon’s. If the solution\r\nof his anagram which I have ventured to propose be accepted, the\r\nproportions of the ingredients in 100 parts were:—\r\n\r\n  _Saltpetre._        _Charcoal._        _Sulphur._\r\n      41.2               29.4               29.4\r\n\r\nThe French recipe of 1338 being incomplete (Table VIII.), the next\r\ncomplete recipe for gunpowder is that given in the MSS. of Dr.\r\nJohn Arderne of Newark, who began to practise as a surgeon before\r\n1350:[415]— “Pernez _j._ _li._ de souffre vif; de charbones de saulx\r\n(i. weloghe) _ij._ _li._; de saltpetre _vj._ _li._ Si les fetez bien\r\net sotelment moudre sur un pierre de marbre, puis bultez le poudre\r\nparmy vn sotille couer-chief; cest poudre vault à gettere pelottes de\r\nfer, ou de plom, ou d’areyne,[416] one vn instrument qe l’em appelle\r\n_gonne_.” This gives in 100 parts:-\r\n\r\n  _Saltpetre._        _Charcoal._        _Sulphur._\r\n      66.6´              22.2´              11.1´\r\n\r\nThe word _gonne_, in the sense of cannon, must have been commonly\r\nknown during the last quarter of the fourteenth century; for Chaucer\r\nuses it with this meaning in the “Hous of Fame,” iii. 553, cir. 1380—\r\n\r\n  “As swift as pelet out of gonne,\r\n  Whan fyr is in the poudré ronne;”\r\n\r\nand Langley uses it with the same meaning in the C text of his “Vision\r\nof Piers Plowman,” xxi. 293, _cir._ 1393:—\r\n\r\n  “Set bows of brake and brasene gonnes,\r\n   And shoot out shot enough his sheltrums to blend.”\r\n\r\nNow the explanatory phrase, “qe l’em appelle gonne,” shows that\r\n_gonne_ was but little known when the above recipe was written. We may\r\ntherefore date it at 1350.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that down to the word _marbre_, the recipe is a\r\nliteral translation of a receipt for rocket composition given by Marcus\r\nGræcus.[417] Yet the two powders, although made of _nominally_ the\r\nsame ingredients in the same proportions, did not produce the same\r\neffects when fired; for gunpowder will not propel a rocket, and rocket\r\ncomposition will not project a cannon-ball. The difference in their\r\neffects was probably due to the researches of Roger Bacon, who had\r\ndiscovered the importance of using pure saltpetre and of thoroughly\r\nincorporating the ingredients. It is improbable that Arderne’s recipe\r\nrepresents the powder used in the cannon of his time. Its proportions\r\nare so entirely out of keeping with those of the French powder of 1338\r\n(Table VIII.) and those of Whitehorne’s powder of 1560 (Table VII.),\r\nthat we may regard it as no more than a laboratory receipt.\r\n\r\nIt needed but little experience to show how far short of perfection\r\nserpentine powder fell.\r\n\r\nWhile the fouling of dry, well-incorporated powder is comparatively\r\ntrifling, a damp or slow-burning powder, such as serpentine, leaves a\r\nmuch larger residue. The consequence was that, after a few rounds, it\r\nwas exceedingly difficult to reload small arms, a considerable part\r\nof the loose, floury charge sticking to the fouling.[418] The remedy\r\nfor this evil was the use of cartridges. Whitehorne mentions “bagges\r\nof linnen or paper” for the charges of cannon in 1560,[419] and in\r\n1590 Sir John Smythe speaks not only of cartridges, but of composite\r\ncartridges for small arms—“cartages with which (musketeers) charge\r\ntheir peeces both with powder and ball at one time.”[420]\r\n\r\nThere are payments for talwood (faggots) “for drying powder” in the\r\nEnglish store accounts 1372-74,[421] and in 1459 the Scotch Government\r\nwere endeavouring to keep their powder dry by storing it in waxed\r\ncanvas bags.[422] An official recommends the English Privy Council in\r\n1589 to sell certain “bad powder” at Dorchester, adding, “the longer\r\nit is kept the worse yt wilbe.”[423] The Navy were of course, then and\r\nalways, the chief sufferers from damp powder. Serpentine powder, Sir\r\nHenry Manwayring tells us in 1664, was never taken to sea (after big\r\nguns had become strong enough to stand corned powder) “both because\r\nit is of small force, and also for that it will, with the aire of the\r\nsea, quickly drie and lose its force.”[424] But corned powder was\r\nby no means proof against damp. In the action fought off Grenada in\r\nJuly 1779, Bishop Watson says “the English shot would not reach” the\r\nFrench. The powder, it was found, “had concreted into large lumps, in\r\nthe middle of which the saltpetre was visible to the naked eye.”[425]\r\nBetween the years 1790 and 1811, 189,000 whole barrels of powder,\r\n“which had formed into lumps from the damp of H.M.’s ships of war,” and\r\nhad consequently been returned into store as useless, were rendered\r\nserviceable in the Government powder factory.[426]\r\n\r\nBeing merely a loose mechanical mixture of three substances with\r\ndifferent specific gravities, serpentine powder had a tendency, when\r\nshaken in transport, to resolve itself into three strata, the heaviest\r\nsubstance (the sulphur) settling down to the bottom, and the lightest\r\n(the charcoal) remaining at the top. This meant, practically, that on\r\ncoming into the enemy’s presence the ingredients had to be incorporated\r\nafresh. To save trouble, and to avoid the danger of a second mixing, it\r\nwas for a long time customary to carry the ingredients separately,[427]\r\nor, at least, to carry the charcoal apart from the saltpetre and\r\nsulphur. There was another argument, however, in favour of this\r\ncourse. While serpentine powder, however tightly secured, gave out\r\na large quantity of impalpable dust which might cause an explosion\r\nat any moment, no explosion was possible so long as the ingredients\r\nwere kept asunder. But whatever was the reason for resorting to such\r\nan expedient, it is evident that the remedy was nearly as bad as the\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nSerpentine powder had another drawback,—it required very careful\r\nramming home. “Thrust the pouder home fair and softly,” says\r\nWhitehorne.[428] “The powder rammed in too hard and the wad also,” says\r\nBourne in 1587, “it will be long before the peece goeth off.... The\r\npowder too loose ... will make the shotte to come short of the mark....\r\nPut up the powder with the rammer head somewhat close, but beat it\r\nnot too hard.”[429] By beating it too hard the interstices between the\r\nparticles through which the flame permeated the charge were diminished\r\nin size, and if beaten sufficiently hard the mixture tended to become\r\na solid which burned away without exploding. Finally, the combustion\r\nof serpentine, at the best, was so slow that a large volume of its gas\r\nescaped wastefully through the vent.\r\n\r\nThese evils were in some cases much lessened, and in others quite\r\ngot rid of by the gradual introduction of corned powder, which is\r\nmentioned in 1429 in the Firebook of Conrad von Schongau,[430] and was\r\nin use for hand-guns in England long before 1560. Corned powder (1)\r\ndeposited less fouling than serpentine; (2) it was less susceptible\r\nto damp, especially after the introduction of glazing;[431] (3)\r\nit did not resolve into strata in transport; (4) it gave out less\r\ndust; (5) it was much less affected by hard ramming; (6) owing to\r\nthe larger interstices between the grains,[432] it burned so quickly\r\nthat there was little or no waste of gas through the vent, and it was\r\nconsequently so strong that 2 lbs. of corned did the same work as 3\r\nlbs. of serpentine powder.[433] It was, in fact, too strong for cannon\r\nfor a long period: Chemistry had outrun Metallurgy. “If serpentine\r\npouder should be occupied (used) in handguns,” says Whitehorne, “it\r\nwould scant be able to drive their pellets[434] a quoit’s cast from\r\ntheir mouths; and if handgunne (_i.e._ corned) pouder should be used\r\nin pieces of ordnance, without great discretion, it would quickly\r\nbreak or marre them.”[435] Here we have the cause which necessitated\r\nthe general retention of serpentine powder for cannon until the first\r\nhalf (or middle) of the sixteenth century, after which it is heard of\r\nno more except for secondary purposes, such as priming, &c. We must\r\nnot overlook the importance of Whitehorne’s remark. He was an educated\r\nman of sound, practical sense, who had been a student of Gray’s Inn,\r\nand whose experience was not confined to the English Artillery, for he\r\nhad seen service in the Low Countries. What he says is a sufficient\r\nsafeguard against inferring too much from Schongau’s mention of corned\r\npowder in 1429. It came slowly into use for hand-grenades and small\r\narms in the fifteenth century; but no country then possessed cannon\r\nstrong enough to stand its explosion, and it did not come into general\r\nuse for another century.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its being at first too strong for big guns, corned\r\npowder had the disadvantage of being dearer than serpentine. The latter\r\nwas sold in 1569 at £80 the last (2400 lbs.); the former in 1570 at\r\n£90.[436] The following Table gives the price of English powder at\r\nvarious times:—\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE V.\r\n\r\n_Price of English Gunpowder per lb._\r\n\r\n  +----------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+\r\n  | Nature.  | 1347 | 1378 | 1462 | 1482 | 1569 | 1578 | 1588 | 1595 | 1695 | 1865 |\r\n  |          |      |      |[437] |[438] |[439] |[440] |[441] |[442] |[443] |[444] |\r\n  +----------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+\r\n  |          | _d._ | _d._ | _d._ | _d._ | _d._ | _d._ | _d._ | _d._ | _d._ | _d._ |\r\n  |Serpentine|13-3/4|13-2/3|  12  |  10  |   8  |  --  |  --  |  --  |  --  |  --  |\r\n  |Corned    |  --  |   -- |  --  |  --  |   9  |  10  |  12  |  13  |10-3/4|   7  |\r\n  |Fine      |  --  |   -- |  --  |  --  |  --  |  11  |  --  |  --  |  --  |  --  |\r\n  +----------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+\r\n\r\nThe remarkable uniformity in the prices of English powder has been\r\nnoticed by Prof. Rogers in his “History of Agriculture and Prices,”\r\niv. 631. He thinks that “fine” powder meant priming powder, because\r\ninfantry soldiers were usually served out with 1 lb. “common” (corned)\r\npowder and ¼-lb. “fine” powder. It doubtless did at one time; but the\r\nterm was applied to all small-arm powder eventually.[445]\r\n\r\nThe prices of the first two powders have necessarily been calculated.\r\nThe price of charcoal in 1347 was .013d. per lb.; in 1378 it was\r\n.02d.[446] The prices of sulphur and saltpetre in 1347 were 8d.\r\nand 18d. per lb. respectively;[447] in 1378 they were (for large\r\nquantities) 4d. and 20d. respectively.[448] From an English MS., quoted\r\nby the Emperor Napoleon III., it appears that the cost of manufacturing\r\npowder at Southampton in 1474 was .864d. per lb.;[449] and, as it is\r\nthe only fact available, I have been obliged to assume that this was\r\nthe cost of making powder in 1347 and 1378. But it is probably not\r\nfar from the truth. The proportions taken for the 1347 powder are\r\nArderne’s, 6-2-1; those for 1378, 3-1-1. From these data we have:—\r\n\r\n\r\n                  1347.                                     1378.\r\n                                  _d._                                   _d._\r\n  6 lbs. saltpetre              108.    | 3 lbs. saltpetre              60.\r\n  2 “ charcoal                     .026 | 1 lb.  charcoal                 .02\r\n  1 lb. sulphur                   8.    | 1  ”   sulphur                 4.\r\n                                ——————— |                              ———————\r\n  Price of 9 lbs. of materials  116.026 | Price of 5 lbs. of materials  64.02\r\n                                ======= |                              =======\r\n    ”    ” 1 lb.  ”     ”        12.892 |   ”    ” 1 lb.  ”     ”       12.80\r\n  Cost of making, per lb.          .864 | Cost of making, per lb.         .864\r\n                                ——————— |                               ——————\r\n       Price of 1 lb.            13.756 |        Price of 1 lb.         13.664\r\n\r\nThe price of French powder in 1375 was 120d. per lb.;[450] but in order\r\nto be able to compare it with the price of English powder in 1378,\r\nwe must know the ratio of French to English money at that period. The\r\nFrench Troyes livre then contained 5760 gs.; the English Tower pound\r\n5400 gs. Therefore—\r\n\r\n  1 livre (pure silver) = 16/15 pound (pure silver).\r\n\r\nUnder Philip of Valois (1328-50) the livre was debased to 1/12 its\r\noriginal value,[451] and almost simultaneously the pound was debased\r\nby Edward III. to 4/5 its primitive value.[452] Or 1 good livre was\r\nworth 12 bad livres, and 1 good pound was worth 5/4 of a bad pound.\r\nTherefore—\r\n\r\n  12 livres = 16/15 (5/4 pound) = 4/3 pound; or 9 livres = 1 pound.\r\n\r\nDividing the price of 1 lb. French powder, 1375, by the price of 1\r\nlb. English powder, 1378, we get 120/13.664 = 8.7; so that the French\r\npowder at this period was somewhat cheaper than the English. As the\r\npurchasing power of fourteenth-century money was about ten times that\r\nof ours, the French powder of 1375 cost about 11s., and the English\r\npowder of 1378, 11s. 4½d. per lb.\r\n\r\nThe high price of early gunpowder resulted from high freights and (in\r\nthe case of saltpetre) the rapacity of Eastern merchants. We may form\r\nsome notion of the price they exacted for their saltpetre which cost\r\nthem little,[453] from the price they put upon their naphtha which cost\r\nthem next to nothing. “Another fountayne there is towarde the Oryent\r\nwhereof is made fyre grekysshe, with other myxtyons (mixtures) that is\r\nput thereto; the which fyre when it is taken and lyght is so hote that\r\nit can not be quenched with water, but with aysel (vinegar), urine or\r\nsande only. The Sarasynes sell this water dere, and derer than they do\r\ngood wyne.”[454]\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of gunpowder soon became a trade. We find a powder-mill\r\nin Ausburg in 1340, in Spandau in 1344, and in Liegnitz in 1348.[455]\r\nThere was a gunmaker in Stockholm in 1430, who was very probably a\r\npowder-maker too;[456] and it is certain that there was a powder-maker\r\nthere in 1464—Mäster Berend.[457] Nor were Governments blind to the\r\nimportance and the profit of the trade. Beckmann states that the\r\nArchbishop of Magdeburg in 1419 only permitted the collection of\r\nsaltpetre on payment of a license,[458] and Clarke informs us that the\r\nPope and the Archduke of Bavaria engaged themselves in powder-making\r\nat an early date.[459] Louis XI. appointed commissioners in 1477 to\r\ncollect all the saltpetre they could find, with power to force an entry\r\nwherever they suspected it was stored.[460]\r\n\r\nDuring the Ancient Period, say 1250-1450, when serpentine was\r\nexclusively used, one powder could only differ from another in\r\ncomposition, that is, in the proportions of the ingredients used,\r\nsupposing them to be equally pure; during the Modern Period, say\r\n1700-1886, the powders used (in each individual State) differed only,\r\nas a general rule, in the size of the grain;[461] during the Transition\r\nPeriod, 1450-1700, they generally differed both in composition and\r\ngrain.\r\n\r\nThe proportions of the ingredients were quite arbitrary during the\r\nAncient Period, and not only Governments, but private manufacturers,\r\nhad their special recipes. As late as 1628 Norton says there were\r\n“infinite recipes for making of powder, but most states have enjoyned a\r\ncertain proportion.”[462]\r\n\r\nThe introduction of corning, far from curbing the lawlessness of the\r\nAncient Period, made confusion worse confounded. _Then_ there was\r\nbut one variable—the proportions of the ingredients; _now_ a second\r\nindependent variable was introduced—the size of the grain. But a\r\nreaction was at hand, which set in first in France, where corned\r\npowder had been adopted in 1525.[463] It appears to have been noticed\r\nduring the second half of the fifteenth century that large-grained\r\npowder was the fittest for big guns, and this fact the French utilised\r\nin 1540 by officially restricting the service powders to three, of\r\nuniform composition but different-sized grains.[464]\r\n\r\nThe largest-grained powder was used for the largest guns, and the\r\ncomposition was 80.7 salp., 11.5 char., and 7.8 sulph., which closely\r\ncorresponded to Whitehorne’s (corned) hand-gun powder—78.3 salp.,\r\n13 char., and 8.7 sulph.[465] It may be questioned, however, whether\r\nthe French, official injunctions notwithstanding, confined themselves\r\nvery religiously to powders of uniform composition. Boillot, whose\r\nwork was published at Chaumont in 1598, says the grain for big guns\r\nwas as large as a pea, that for medium guns the size of hempseed, and\r\nthat for serpents, &c., still smaller. But from a remark he makes on\r\nreaching the manufacture of powder—“vous viendrez à la composition (de\r\nla pouldre), mais par poix et mesure, selon que vous voudrez faire les\r\npouldres”[466]—it is clear that powders for all purposes were not of\r\nthe same composition.\r\n\r\nDuring the first half of the seventeenth century the French official\r\npowder was weaker than the above—75.6 salp., 13.6 char., and 10.8\r\nsulph.—and for big guns had grains as large as hazel-nuts.[467] At\r\nPont-à-Mousson, just across the German border, powders of different\r\ncompositions were in use in 1620;[468] and east of the Rhine powder\r\nfor different guns probably varied in grain, and certainly varied in\r\ncomposition. “Of the various powders now made,” says Furtenbach in\r\n1627, “the following are generally employed:[469]—\r\n\r\n  Saltpetre.    Charcoal.     Sulphur.\r\n     69.0          16.5         14.5 for big guns;\r\n     72.4          14.5         13.1 for small guns;\r\n     75.7          13.0         11.3 for small arms.”\r\n\r\nThe information given to us about granulation by the early English\r\ngunners is neither clear nor full.\r\n\r\nWhen Whitehorne tells us that the method of corning “all sorts of\r\npowder” was the same, namely, by means of a sieve and a few heavy metal\r\nballs,[470] what meaning did he intend to convey by the phrase “all\r\nsorts of powder”? There can be little doubt that he meant “powders\r\nof whatever composition, and whatever the size of the grain to be\r\nproduced;” first, because it would be preposterous to assume that all\r\nthe sieves of his time had meshes of equal size; and secondly, because\r\nthere is abundant evidence to show that, long after Whitehorne’s time,\r\nthe powders for different guns in England (and elsewhere) varied both\r\nin composition and grain. In 1620 Thybovril and Hanzelet tell us that\r\npowder to be granulated is to be passed through a sieve with holes\r\n“de la grosseur que vous desirez votre poudre”;[471] and eight years\r\nafterwards Norton uses the very same ambiguous phrase, “a syve ... made\r\nfull of holes of the bignesse you desire your cornes.”[472] Did they\r\nmean that the size of the grain in their time was purely arbitrary\r\nand might be of any magnitude whatever? A passage in Boillot’s\r\n(earlier) work explains their meaning much better than they have done\r\nit themselves. He first tells us that the sieve is to have holes “de\r\ntelle grosseur que vous voudrez,” and he then goes on to explain the\r\nproper size of grain for use in the different classes of ordnance,\r\nas given here on a previous page. In a word, three or four kinds of\r\nsieves (differing in the size of their meshes) were procurable—some\r\nfor graining powder for big guns, others for graining powder for medium\r\nguns, &c. &c.—and having fixed upon the gun from which your powder\r\n(when grained) was to be fired (and consequently upon the size of\r\nthe grain), you were to select those sieves which had meshes “of the\r\nbignesse you desired your cornes.”\r\n\r\nFrom the phrase used above by Norton, it is certain that several\r\npowders, differing in grain, were in use when he wrote; from the\r\nevidence of Norton,[473] Nye,[474] and others, it is equally certain\r\nthat several different receipts for making powder were in use during\r\ntheir time. The conclusion is that during the first half of the\r\nseventeenth century powders made in England for different guns varied\r\nboth in composition and size of grain.\r\n\r\nThe lawlessness in composition and grain during the greater part of the\r\nTransition Period was the natural consequence of the absence of any\r\ninstrument to measure the comparative strength of different powders,\r\nand enable gunners to establish some standard for the proportions of\r\nthe ingredients and the size of the grain.\r\n\r\nThe earliest instrument proposed for testing the strength of powder\r\nwas, I believe, Bourne’s “engine or little boxe,” which, he says, was\r\n“very necessarie to be used.”[475] Whether he invented it himself or\r\nnot, it is impossible to say: he tells us, “some of (the inventions)\r\nI have gathered by one meane and some by another, but the most part\r\nof them hath been mine own.”[476] The engine was a wretched one. The\r\npowder to be tested was ignited in a small metal cylinder with a heavy\r\nlid (working on a hinge) which when raised could not shut of itself.\r\nThe angle through which the lid was raised by the explosion indicated\r\nthe strength of the powder.\r\n\r\nA better instrument was that described by Furtenbach in 1627.[477]\r\nIt differed from Bourne’s “little boxe” in that the lid was only\r\nlaid upon the cylinder. When the powder exploded the lid was blown\r\nupwards along two vertical wires which passed through it; but it could\r\nnot descend again of itself, being held in the place it reached by\r\niron teeth (like those which supported the lid of Bourne’s box). Nye\r\ndescribes this instrument, and suggests that the comparative strength\r\nof powders should be further tested by measuring the penetration of\r\npistol balls into clay, and the ranges of projectiles fired from a\r\nsmall mortar.[478] This is, I believe, the first proposal of the\r\n_mortar éprouvette_, 1647. The French certainly adopted them before\r\n1686, often though it has been said that they then introduced them.\r\nOn the 18th September of this year Louis XIV. published an ordonnance\r\ncomplaining of “the variety of eprouvettes” in use for testing powder,\r\nand directing that for the future no powder should be accepted unless\r\n3 oz. of it could throw a ball of 60 lbs. 50 toises (320 ft.) from the\r\nGovernment pattern mortar.[479] In a previous ordonnance (April 16,\r\n1686) the King had protested against the bad charcoal (_de méchante\r\nqualité_) constantly employed; against impure saltpetre (_rempli de\r\ngraisse et de sel_), insisting upon the exclusive use of saltpetre “de\r\ntrois cuites”; and against insufficient incorporation (_dix ou douze\r\nheures ... au lieu de ... vingt quatre heures_).[480] But he marred the\r\nreforms he made by taking the unaccountable step of introducing one\r\npowder, of the same composition and size of grain, for all arms.[481]\r\nFor this blunder the French afterwards paid in blood, especially during\r\nthe Peninsular war.[482]\r\n\r\nAbout the beginning of the eighteenth century most countries had\r\nreduced their powders to two or three, which were of the same\r\ncomposition, and differed only in grain. In 1742 Benjamin Robins,\r\nby his “New Principles of Gunnery,” placed gunnery upon a strictly\r\nscientific basis, and by his epoch-making invention of the ballistic\r\npendulums[483] enabled gunners for the first time to measure the\r\nmuzzle-velocity of projectiles with considerable accuracy. It may have\r\nbeen owing to the lessons taught by this instrument that, between\r\n1742 and 1781, we changed the proportions of the ingredients of\r\nour powder from 75—12½—12½ to 75—15—10. Profiting by the rapid\r\nprogress of electricity during the first half of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, Sir Charles Wheatstone proposed in 1840 his electro-magnetic\r\nchronoscope,[484] which registered to the 1/730 part of a second, to\r\nreplace Robins’ ponderous pendulum.\r\n\r\nWheatstone’s instrument was not adopted by our Government, but his\r\nidea was followed up and improved upon by Captain Navez, of the\r\nBelgian Artillery, who in 1847 brought forward his electro-ballistic\r\npendulum.[485] Only one instrument was now wanting to enable the\r\nmechanical effect of the explosion to be directly and completely\r\nobserved—an instrument to measure the pressure upon the bore of the\r\ngun; and this want was supplied in 1861 when Captain T. J. Rodman,\r\nOrdnance Department, United States Army, produced his Indenting\r\nApparatus and his Internal Pressure Gauge.[486] The following Table\r\ngives the results of some experiments with the new instruments:—\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE VI.\r\n\r\n_Showing the connection between the Size of the Grain, Muzzle Velocity,\r\nand Pressure on Bore._\r\n\r\n  +-------------+---------+-----------+-----------+------------------+\r\n  | Diameter of | Charge. | Weight of |  Muzzle   |   Pressure on    |\r\n  |   Grains.   |   Lbs.  |   Shot.   | Velocity. | Bottom of Bore.  |\r\n  |    Ins.     |         |   Lbs.    |   F.s.    | Tons per Sq.

The consequence of this discovery was\r\nthe manufacture of various very large grained powders such as pebble\r\npowder, &c., for heavy guns. But the thorough knowledge of the\r\nmechanical effect of the explosion of gunpowder gained by the use of\r\nthe Navez and Rodman instruments, was of little avail to anybody, for\r\ngunpowder had nearly run its course. Just twenty-five years after the\r\nintroduction of the pressure gauge M. Vieille put the French Government\r\nin possession of a nitrocellulose explosive,[487] and gunpowder was\r\nadded to the list of things that were.\r\n\r\nThroughout the whole gunpowder period enthusiasts seem never to have\r\nbeen wanting who believed in the possibility of making smokeless\r\npowder and noiseless powder. Castner’s powder, which contained only\r\n3 per cent, sulphur, seems to have been the nearest approach to the\r\nformer, but no powder containing sulphur could be absolutely smokeless.\r\nWhether early gunners suspected this or not I do not know; certain it\r\nis, however, that sulphurless powder was under discussion centuries\r\nago. Rabelais (who may have heard soldiers talking about the matter)\r\nalludes jokingly to “pouldre de canon curieusement composée, degressée\r\nde son soulfre.”[488] In 1756 the French actually experimented with\r\nsulphurless mixtures, one of which (80 per cent. sulph. and 20 per\r\ncent. ch.) gave good results in range, with very little smoke. It\r\nproved to be worthless for military purposes from the difficulty\r\nof corning it, and from its crumbling to dust during ordinary\r\ntransport.[489] The belief in a noiseless powder was scoffed at by\r\nWhitehorne: “There be many who bring up lies, saying that they can tell\r\nhow to make pouder that shooting in gunnes shall make no noise, the\r\nwhich is impossible.” A century afterwards Sir Thomas Browne believed\r\nmeans might be adopted, if not to stifle the sound altogether, at least\r\n“to abate the vigour thereof, or silence its bombulation.”[490]\r\n\r\nTables VII. and VIII. give the composition of gunpowder at various\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE VII.\r\n\r\n_English Gunpowder._\r\n\r\n  +---------+----------+----------+----------+-----------+----------+----------+----------+\r\n  |         | 1250[491]| 1482[492]| 1569[493]| 1578[494] | 1588[495]| 1595[496]| 1695[497]|\r\n  |         | _cir._   | _cir._   |          |           |          |          |          |\r\n  +---------+----------+----------+----------+-----------+----------+----------+----------+\r\n  |Saltpetre|   41.2   |  66.6´   |  50.0    |   66.6´   |   71.4   |   75.0   |    75    |\r\n  |Charcoal |   29.4   |  22.2´   |  33.3´   |   16.6´   |   14.3   |   12.5   |    15    |\r\n  |Sulphur  |   29.4   |  11.1´   |  16.6´   |   16.6´   |   14.3   |   12.5   |    10    |\r\n  +---------+----------+----------+----------+-----------+----------+----------+----------+\r\n\r\n\r\n_N.B._—All these writers give the proportions of gunpowder in their\r\nown times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE VIII.\r\n\r\n_Foreign Gunpowder._\r\n\r\n  +---------+-----------+-----------+------------+------------+-----------+-----------+------------+\r\n  |         |France[498]|Sweden[499 |Germany[500]|Denmark[501]|France[502]|Sweden[503]|Germany[504]|\r\n  |         |    1338   |   1560    |   1595     |   1608     |   1650    |   1697    |   1882     |\r\n  +---------+-----------+-----------+------------+------------+-----------+-----------+------------+\r\n  |Saltpetre|    50     |   66.6´   |   52.2     |   68.3     |   75.6    |    73     |    78      |\r\n  |Charcoal |    ?      |   16.6´   |   26.1     |   23.2     |   13.6    |    17     |    19      |\r\n  |Sulphur  |    25     |   16.6´   |   21.7     |    8.5     |   10.8    |   10      |     3      |\r\n  +---------+-----------+-----------+------------+------------+-----------+-----------+------------+\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nSHOCK PROJECTILES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe nature of the first Artillery projectiles was determined by the\r\nnature of the small-arm missiles in use when cannon were introduced by\r\nthe Germans. To use the bulky and ponderous projectiles of the machines\r\nin these small and feeble pieces was out of the question; nothing\r\nremained, therefore, but to adopt the darts, bolts, or quarrels which\r\nproduced such deadly effect when shot from cross-bows:—\r\n\r\n  \"Of Arblasters grete plenté were,\r\n  Noon armure myght her stroke withstonde.\"[505]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Darts._\r\n\r\nThe iron darts feathered with brass—\"garros ferrés et empanés en\r\ndeux cassez\"—which are mentioned in the earliest document relating\r\nto Artillery that has been found in France,[506] dated 1338, belonged\r\nunmistakably to the same family as those used for cross-bows. The\r\nbrazen feathers were nailed to the shaft, and the missile, which\r\nweighed about 7 oz.,[507] was wrapped in a leather covering, so as to\r\nfit the bore tightly. Experience quickly proved these darts to be quite\r\nunsuited for firearms; yet they dragged on a lingering and precarious\r\nexistence for quite 250 years. In the anonymous _Livre de Canonnerie et\r\nArtifice de feu_, Paris, 1561, the title of the seventy-fourth chapter\r\nis: “Pour tirer lances ferrées d’une bombarde, canon ou autre baston\r\nà feu de cannonerie.”[508] To a return of the powder on board his\r\nsquadron, dated March 30, 1588, addressed to Government, Sir Francis\r\nDrake added a P.S.: “Forgett not the 500 musketts, and at least 1000\r\narrows”;[509] and on the 8th April following the Privy Council ordered\r\nhim to be supplied with “muskittes, 200; arrowes for the said muskittes\r\nwith tamkines for eche, 1000.”[510]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Round Shot._\r\n\r\nOn the failure of the darts, informal trials were begun everywhere with\r\nballs of stone, iron, bronze, and lead, to discover which material was\r\nbest suited for ordnance.\r\n\r\nStone shot, which had been used in machines for countless centuries,\r\nwere on trial for cannon in France in 1346;[511] and, unless a ballad\r\nwritten about this time refers to machines and not to guns, we\r\nemployed them at the siege of Calais the same year:—\r\n\r\n  “Gonners to schew their art\r\n   Into the town in many a parte\r\n     Schot many a fulle great stone.\r\n   Thanked be God and Mary mild,\r\n   They hurt neyther man, woman, nor child;\r\n     To the houses, though, they did harm.”[512]\r\n\r\nStone shot were in use in Italy in 1364,[513] and in 1378 Richard\r\nII. ordered 600 stones to be bought for the cannon in the castle of\r\nBrest.[514] They were employed more or less in England and elsewhere\r\nuntil the Great Rebellion, and possibly even later.\r\n\r\nThe earliest mention of iron shot, perhaps, is that in the Arderne\r\nMSS., say 1350;[515] although we should not be justified in inferring\r\nfrom it that they were then in actual use. There were 928 iron shot\r\nin the arsenal of Bologna in 1381,[516] but iron seems to have\r\nbeen sparingly employed until the time of Charles VIII. of France,\r\n1483-98.[517] The only iron projectiles mentioned by (or, we may\r\ninfer, known to) the authors of the Berlin Firebook, 1400-50,[518] and\r\nof the _Tractatus de Pugnaculis_ of the same period preserved in the\r\nHof-Bibliothek at Vienna,[519] are iron bullets for handguns. When\r\nused against troops in wooden buildings, &c., they both recommend that\r\nthe balls should be heated red-hot Hot (cannon) balls were introduced\r\nmuch later, in 1579, by Stephen Bathory, King of Poland.[520] It was\r\na simple matter to discharge hot projectiles from a machine, but a\r\ndelicate operation to load a gun with them without exploding the\r\ncharge. In fact, it was impracticable until the thick wet wad had been\r\ndevised.\r\n\r\nIt appears from Petrarch’s _De Remediis Utriusque Fortunæ_,[521] which\r\nmust have been written in or before 1344, that bronze shot—_glandes\r\næneas_—were then in use among the Italians; and Valturio mentions\r\nbronze shells—_pilæ æneæ_—in his work, which, although not published\r\nuntil 1472, was already written in 1463.[522]\r\n\r\nA document, dated 29th April 1345, proves that the French were\r\nemploying lead shot at this time;[523] and the accounts of Robert de\r\nMildenhale, Keeper of Edward III.’s Wardrobe, show that we sent to\r\nCalais on the 1st and 2nd September 1346, 73 large leaden shot, 31\r\nsmall shot, and 6 pieces of lead.[524] Finally, the accounts of John\r\nde Sleaford, Clerk of the King’s Privy Wardrobe, prove that in 1372-74\r\nworkmen were employed in the Tower in making leaden “pelottes” for\r\nguns.[525]\r\n\r\nIn a battle at Taro, 1491, the Venetians are said to have fired upon\r\nthe French with shot of all three metals—iron, bronze, and lead.[526]\r\n\r\nThese trials naturally resulted in the general, but by no means\r\nexclusive, adoption of stone as the best material for round shot;\r\nbecause it was found that not only the use of metal balls was\r\nconsiderably more costly than that of stone, but that the heavier\r\ncharges of powder necessitated by metal shot exerted a destructive\r\neffect upon the feeble cannon.\r\n\r\nThe respective prices per lb. of iron,[527] gun-metal,[528] and\r\nlead[529] in the second half of the fourteenth century were .856,\r\n2.44, and .627 pennies, fourteenth century money. Multiplying by 10, to\r\nget their approximate prices in our money, we obtain:—\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE IX.\r\n\r\n_Comparative Prices of Metals, 1375 and 1865._\r\n\r\n  +-----------+----------------+------------+----------+--------------+\r\n  |           | Price per lb., |            |  Price   |              |\r\n  |           |     1375,      |            | per lb., |              |\r\n  |  Metal.   |  multiplied    |  Ratio.    |  1865.   |              |\r\n  |           |     by 10.     |            |   _d._   |              |\r\n  |           |     _d._       |            |          |              |\r\n  +-----------+----------------+------------+----------+--------------+\r\n  | Iron      |      8.56      | 8.5 to 5.7 | 1 to 1.5 | {Bar iron of |\r\n  | Gun-metal |     24.4       |   2.03     |   12     | { average    |\r\n  | Lead      |      6.27      |   3.13     |    2     | { quality    |\r\n  +-----------+----------------+------------+----------+--------------+\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that the price of bronze, which had been brought\r\nto perfection by the ancients, and whose manufacture was independent\r\nof modern appliances, only fell to half its old price in five\r\ncenturies; that the price of lead, which had some dependence on these\r\nappliances, fell to a little over one-third; while the price of iron,\r\nwhose progress depended essentially upon the use of coal, scientific\r\nfurnaces, &c., fell to between one-fifth to one-ninth.\r\n\r\nThe weights of (wrought) iron,[530] bronze,[531] and lead balls of\r\n4” diameter are respectively 9.3, 10.18, and 13.8 lbs., and Master\r\nGunner Nye informs us that the weight of a stone ball of this diameter\r\nwas 3.375 lbs.[532] Therefore the respective prices of the iron,\r\nbronze, and lead balls were 7.96, 26.468, and 8.65 pence, exclusive\r\nof the cost of manufacture; while the price of the material of the\r\nstone ball was much less than a farthing.[533] Again, for powder at\r\n13.664d. per lb.,[534] and charges one-ninth the weight of the shot,\r\nthe prices of the charges for the stone, iron, bronze, and lead balls\r\nare respectively 5.12, 14.07, 15.44, and 20.496 pence. We can therefore\r\nform an estimate of the relative cost of one round with balls of the\r\nfour materials.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE X.\r\n\r\n_Comparative Cost of One Round, 4.25″ gun; stone, iron, bronze, and\r\nlead balls._\r\n\r\n  +--------------------+-----------+------------+----------+------------+\r\n  |                    |  Stone.   |   Iron.    | Bronze.  |  Lead.     |\r\n  |                    |   _d._    |   _d._     |  _d._    |   _d._     |\r\n  +--------------------+-----------+------------+----------+------------+\r\n  | Price of 4” ball   |   0.25    |   7.96     |  26.468  |   8.652    |\r\n  | Price of powder    |   5.12    |  14.07     |  15.44   |  20.496    |\r\n  | Cost of one Round  |   5.37    |  22.03     |  41.908  |  29.148    |\r\n  |   or in our money  |4s. 5-3/4d.|18s. 4-1/4d.| 34s. 11d.|24s. 3-1/2d.|\r\n  +--------------------+-----------+------------+----------+------------+\r\n\r\nThese figures do not profess to give the absolute price of one round,\r\nbut they represent pretty accurately the relative cost of a round with\r\nthe different projectiles.\r\n\r\nThe pressures per square inch exerted upon the bore of a gun are\r\ndirectly proportional to the weight of the charges used, and these\r\ncharges were directly proportional to the weights of the projectiles\r\nused. We have therefore the following comparative pressures:—\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE XI\r\n\r\n_Numbers proportional to the pressures per square inch on the bore of a\r\n4.25″ gun when fired with shot of different materials._\r\n\r\n  +--------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n  | Stone. | Iron.  |Bronze. | Lead.  |\r\n  |  3.6   |  10    | 10.9   |  14.5  |\r\n  +--------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n\r\nTable X. shows that the cost per round with stone was much less than\r\nwith metal shot, while Table XI. shows how great was the disparity\r\nbetween the pressures on the bore in the two cases, which, as the\r\ncalibre (and therefore the absolute pressure) increased, became a\r\nserious matter. With the very small, early guns, the greater cost and\r\nheavier strain may not have been sensibly felt. The extra cost in\r\ntheir case was not very considerable, and the increased pressure may\r\nnot have been even suspected until guns began to burst.[535] But that\r\nthese disadvantages made themselves unmistakably felt when the guns\r\ngrew larger is proved beyond a doubt by the fact that “great stone shot\r\nand great cannon were introduced together.”[536] Leaden bullets were\r\nretained for hand-guns, because it was comparatively easy to strengthen\r\nthem, and the metal, although dearer per bullet than iron, was much\r\neasier to manipulate. Iron shot were doubtless used as a general rule\r\nfor breaching purposes, for which stone shot were ill adapted, owing to\r\ntheir lightness and liability to break up. We even hear from time to\r\ntime of the use of bronze and lead cannon balls.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Case._\r\n\r\nThere were two ways, in early times, of firing a volley of small\r\nshot at troops. The first consisted in mounting a number of small\r\nbombards on one carriage and firing them all, or a certain number\r\nof them, together. Gattaro speaks of 144 bombards mounted on the\r\nsame bed, and so arranged as to fire thirty-six at a time.[537] The\r\nwhole apparatus was called a _ribaudequin_, _barricade_, _orgue_,\r\n_orgelgeschütz_, &c.; the two latter names being given to it because\r\nit resembled “organ-pipes placed upon a broad carriage.”[538] By\r\nthe second method the bullets required for the volley were put for\r\nconvenience in a cartridge case or canister, and fired from a large\r\nbombard. The bullets, according to General Köhler, were simply pebbles\r\nof flint.[539] During the Indian Mutiny, I forget where, a volley of\r\n“Pyramid” or “Pool” balls was fired by the mutineers from a clubhouse\r\nupon our storming party with deadly effect.\r\n\r\nEssenwein gives plates of an orgue, dated 1390-1400, and of a gun\r\nfiring case dated 1410.[540] Case was used at the siege of Belgrade,\r\n1439,[541] and at the siege of Scutari, 1478.[542] Orgues were used as\r\nlate as the Great Rebellion. At the battle of Copredy Bridge, 1644,\r\nthe Cavaliers took “two baricadoes of wood, which were drawn upon\r\nwheels, and in each seven small brass and leather cannon, charged with\r\ncase.”[543]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Shrapnel._\r\n\r\nIsolated attempts to fire shell from guns (as distinguished from\r\nhowitzers and mortars) had been made from time to time in the course\r\nof the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, but they proved, one and\r\nall of them, abortive. The first methodical and successful shell-fire\r\nfrom guns was carried on during the siege of Gibraltar, 1779-83, at the\r\nsuggestion of an English Infantry officer.\r\n\r\nThe distance from our nearest batteries to the Spanish lines when the\r\nsiege began was 1700 to 2000 yards,[544] and at this range our fire\r\nwas ineffective. Many of the mortar shell burst at the muzzle from\r\nthe heavy charges required for these long ranges, a gunner losing his\r\nlife on one occasion from this cause.[545] The shell that withstood\r\nthe shock flew wildly; the fuzes were “in general faulty”;[546] many\r\ngood shell were smothered in the sand of which the Spanish works were\r\nconstructed; those that burst produced but little effect;[547] and\r\nround shot were of no avail against sandbanks twenty-two feet high.\r\nAs fire against the Spanish works was useless, it only remained to\r\ndirect it on the working parties. Against them our mortar fire was\r\nas ineffective as against the works, and what was to be looked for\r\nfrom guns provided only with round shot and case? Case would not\r\ncarry one-sixth of the range, and round shot against handfuls of men,\r\nscattered here and there, were as worthless as shell. The difficulty\r\nwas still unsolved when Captain Mercier, 39th Regiment, suggested\r\nfiring the 5.5-inch shell of the royal mortars, with _short_ fuzes,\r\nfrom the 24-pounder guns which had the same calibre as the mortars,\r\n5.8-inch. A trial was made on the 25th September 1779 with (I believe)\r\nthe “Rock gun,” which was a 24-pounder; the “calculated fuzes,”[548]\r\nit was found, “often burst (the shell) over the heads of the working\r\nparties,”[549] and Merciers brilliant proposal was officially adopted.\r\n\r\nWhen the siege was over, and men had time to think, it became clear\r\nenough that excellent as was Captain Mercier’s plan as a makeshift\r\nduring the stress and strain of a siege, it had its weak points. The\r\nstrong charge necessary to burst the common shell tended to scatter the\r\nfragments here and there in all directions, and the fragments were few\r\nin number. Experiments were carried on in Prussia in 1761 to determine\r\nthe bursting charges which broke (mortar and howitzer) shell into\r\nthe greatest number of pieces. It was found that royal mortar shell\r\n(_maximum_ bursting charge, 1 lb. 2 oz.) broke into eight pieces, with\r\na bursting charge of 1 lb., and into nineteen pieces with a bursting\r\ncharge of 14 oz., these figures being the means of six trials.[550]\r\n\r\nIn any case, the siege of Gibraltar proved beyond denial that we\r\npossessed no recognised and effective projectile against troops in open\r\norder beyond the range of case. To fill the void thus disclosed in our\r\nammunition, Lieutenant Henry Shrapnel, R.A., conceived the idea in\r\n1784[551] of a gun-projectile, which he called “spherical case.” As he\r\nwas quartered in Newfoundland during the siege, it is improbable that\r\nhe was aware at this time of Capt. Mercier’s plan. At all events he did\r\nnot follow it, the principle of his invention being radically different\r\nfrom that of common shell. The bursting charge of the latter was a\r\n_maximum_, the bursting charge of the former was a _minimum_; the fuze\r\nof the latter was bored long, the fuze of the former was bored short;\r\nthe fragments of common shell were projected by the bursting charge of\r\nthe shell, the fragments of the shrapnel by the charge of the gun from\r\nwhich it was fired.\r\n\r\nThis absolutely new and original invention at first met the fate of\r\nmany other new inventions—it was long disregarded.[552] Not until\r\n1803, when England was in grave danger, did the authorities bestir\r\nthemselves about it: a trial of Shrapnel’s shell was then ordered, and\r\nthe Ordnance Committee reported in their favour.[553] How great an\r\ninvention these shell were may be measured by their inextinguishable\r\nvitality: they outlived official apathy; they overcame endless\r\nobjections; they survived countless modifications; they adapted\r\nthemselves to rifled guns; and at the present moment they are the best\r\nprojectiles available against troops in open order beyond the range of\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nThe originality of the Shrapnel shell did not, of course, remain\r\nunchallenged. Certain officers in France, Germany, and Belgium\r\ndiscovered that the invention was an old one, and that Master Gunner\r\nSamuel Zimmermann had employed Shrapnel no later than 1573. His MS.,\r\nit may be observed, had been removed from Heidelberg to Rome during\r\nthe Thirty Years’ War; was sent back to Heidelberg in 1816; and was\r\nnot discovered by Hauptmann Toll until 1852, just ten years after\r\nShrapnel’s death.[554]\r\n\r\nZimmermann’s projectile was not constructed on Shrapnel’s principles.\r\n\r\nIt consisted of a leaden cylinder, with a time fuze fixed in the end\r\nplaced next to the charge of the gun. The back half of the cylinder was\r\nfilled with strong (_röschem_) powder; the front half with bullets;\r\nand the missile was intended to act a few hundred paces (_etlich\r\nhundert schrytt_) beyond the ordinary range of case, say, at 500-600\r\nyards. A very small bursting charge would have sufficed to burst open\r\na leaden case: why, then, did the Master Gunner use the _maximum_\r\ncharge which was possible without unduly diminishing the number of\r\nbullets—a charge, too, of specially strong powder? Because he intended\r\nthe bursting charge not only to open the case, but to accelerate the\r\nvelocity of the bullets—he could have had no other conceivable reason.\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been the merits of this missile, it was certainly\r\nnot a Shrapnel, as will be seen clearly by placing the details of\r\nconstruction of the two projectiles side by side.\r\n\r\n  _Zimmermann’s Case_, 1573.               | _Shrapnel’s Spherical Case_, 1805.\r\n                                           |\r\n  (_a_) A hollow leaden cylinder.          |(_a’_) A hollow iron sphere.\r\n  (_b_) Thickness of cylinder unknown.     |(_b’_) Thickness of sphere a minimum.[555]\r\n  (_c_) Contained a number of bullets.[556]|(_c’_) Contained a number of bullets.\r\n  (_d_) Bursting charge a _maximum_.       |(_d’_) Bursting charge a _minimum_.\r\n  (_e_) Bullets accelerated by explosion   |(_e’_) Bullets (as far as practicable)\r\n          of bursting charge.              |       unaffected by explosion of\r\n                                           |       bursting charge.\r\n  (_f_) A very bad fuze.                   |(_f’_) A tolerably fair fuze.[557]\r\n  (_g_) Range up to 500-600 yds.           |(_g’_) Range up to 3000 yds.\r\n\r\nThe annals of Artillery will be ransacked in vain for Shrapnel shell\r\nbefore the nineteenth century, because the successful application of\r\nShrapnel’s principle was impossible until an extremely accurate time\r\nfuze had been constructed, and no nation possessed a really good fuze\r\nbefore that epoch[558]—nor in truth until long afterwards. The results\r\nof the Shrapnel practice in 1819,[559] after Shrapnel and many others\r\nhad devoted their best energies to the improvement of time fuzes\r\nfor sixteen years, show how defective they still were. But although\r\nthe want of a sufficiently accurate fuze made the Shrapnel system a\r\npractical impossibility before the nineteenth century, a man above his\r\nfellows might have dreamt dreams of distant case fire ages before.\r\n\r\nThat Zimmermann was groping about blindly in search of the projectile\r\nShrapnel found in 1784, is proved beyond a doubt by the question\r\nwhich the Feuerwerker puts to the Büchsenmeister: “Cannot a case shot\r\nbe made which will leave the bore whole and burst at a few hundred\r\npaces’ distance?”[560] But Zimmermann failed in his search: what he\r\nsought did not lie on the road that he took. Like Fronsperger,[561]\r\nhe placed his fuze next the charge, in consequence of which (as the\r\nold man frankly confesses) most of his cylinders burst in the bore:\r\n“Gemainlich im Stückh angegangen und zersprungen.” Boillot, a quarter\r\nof a century later, had a better knowledge of gunnery: “adviserez que\r\nle trou d’icelle (the fuze-hole) soit du costé de la bouche dudit\r\nmortier.”[562] Zimmermann filled the front half of his cylinder with\r\nbullets and the rear half with strong powder, obviously assuming\r\nthe stability of the missile in its flight. Now Prof. Greenhill has\r\ngiven us a table showing the _minimum_ twist at the muzzle requisite\r\nto give stability of rotation to elongated projectiles. If a common\r\nshell’s length be 3 calibres, it requires a twist of 1 turn in 38.45\r\ncalibres; if its length be 4 calibres it requires a twist of 1 turn\r\nin 27.6 calibres; and so on.[563] How far, then, would Zimmermann’s\r\nill-balanced, smooth-bore cylinder have travelled before it toppled\r\nover, with the certain result that, when it did, the large bursting\r\ncharge would blow the bullets any way but the right way?\r\n\r\nZimmermann’s projectile failed, and his sole merit consists in vaguely\r\nforeshadowing the Shrapnel, just as Roger Bacon dimly foresaw balloons\r\nand ships driven by machinery—“Marine engines can be constructed and\r\nworked by one man which will propel the largest vessels quicker than a\r\nship’s crew of oarsmen.... Flying machines can also be made.”[564] His\r\ncylinder no more establishes Zimmermann’s claim to be the inventor, or\r\neven the suggester, of Shrapnel shell, than Bourne’s method of shooting\r\n“three times in a peece at one lading of her”[565] entitles him to be\r\nregarded as the inventor of quick-firing guns.\r\n\r\nWe should have been spared much unprofitable controversy had foreign\r\ncritics thought fit to make themselves acquainted with the nature\r\nand properties of Shrapnel’s Spherical Case before discussing its\r\nhistory. Its history is simple. It was made in England, the invention\r\nof an English Artillery officer who owed nothing to earlier gunners in\r\nGermany or anywhere else.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nIGNEOUS PROJECTILES\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hot Shot._\r\n\r\nThe Britons set fire to the Roman Camp during Cæsar’s second invasion,\r\n54 B.C., by discharging hot balls of clay among the tents.[566] At the\r\nattack on Placentia, A.D. 69, igneous missiles were employed (_glandes\r\net missilem ignem_), and probably destroyed the amphitheatre.[567] As\r\nbefore mentioned, hot shot (for cannon) were invented by the Polish\r\nking, Stephen Bathory, in 1579.[568] Their greatest triumph was the\r\ndestruction of d’Arçon’s floating batteries and a great part of the\r\nSpanish fleet at Gibraltar, 13th September 1782.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Incendiary Fireballs._\r\n\r\nThe gunners of old encountered great difficulties in their endeavours\r\nto introduce igneous projectiles. Their use in the early guns was not\r\nabsolutely impossible, but it would have been fruitless; for to prove\r\neffective an igneous projectile, whether incendiary or explosive,\r\nmust contain a considerable mass of combustible matter, and this\r\ncondition could not be fulfilled with guns of very small calibre.\r\nWhen the calibre had greatly increased, during the last quarter of the\r\nfourteenth century, any attempt to employ such igneous projectiles as\r\nwere in use with the machines must have ended in failure. The action\r\nof the machines was similar to that of a sling, and the shells (or\r\nenvelopes) of their incendiary missiles were made just strong enough\r\nto resist the pressure to which they were subjected on discharge,\r\nalthough not strong enough to bear the shock of impact with the object\r\nthey struck. This broke them up and scattered their blazing contents\r\nabout. Such projectiles were evidently unfit for use in cannon;\r\nfor the explosion of the charge would inevitably break them up in\r\nthe bore, and their viscous contents would travel but a very short\r\nway. Owing to these difficulties the machines held their ground to\r\nthe middle of the fifteenth century, if not longer, and the igneous\r\nprojectiles ultimately constructed for cannon were developments of the\r\nhand-grenade.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 31 of the plate from the MS. of Kyeser’s “Bellifortis,” 1405,\r\ngiven by Herr von Romocki (i. 169), we are shown a projectile which\r\nunquestionably belongs to the same family as the _tonneau_ which\r\nterrified Joinville and his companions;[569] but this barrel could have\r\nonly been discharged from a machine. Whether Figs. 26 and 28 of the\r\nsame plate were thrown by hand or machine depended on their size, which\r\nwe do not know. From their construction, with a mere covering of cloth\r\nor cordage, we may safely conclude that they were not gun-projectiles.\r\n\r\nWe are given a detailed account of fireballs in the German Firebook,\r\n1400-50, belonging to the Royal Library, Berlin, MS. Germ. qu. 1018.\r\nMissiles are there described which consisted of an interior ball\r\nof gunpowder kneaded with spirits of wine, smeared over with thick\r\nincendiary matter, rolled tightly in a cover of cotton steeped in the\r\nsame mixture, and secured by two metal bands at right angles to each\r\nother. They could be either thrown by hand or fired from a bombard.\r\nIn the latter case a hole was bored through the ball and the plug\r\nwhich was used in bombards to close the end of the powder-chamber next\r\nthe projectile, in order to admit the flame into the interior of the\r\nball. The success of the missile, it was thought, depended on the hole\r\nthrough the ball being exactly opposite the hole through the plug, a\r\ncondition which could be only fulfilled in a breechloading bombard. The\r\ninventor believed that the ball would explode, for he warns the gunner\r\nto throw it before the flame reaches the composition, lest it “blow\r\nhis head off.”[570] It is obvious, however, that the gunner’s head\r\nwas quite safe, although he might burn his fingers, when using these\r\nincendiary toys which are unknown to military history. The incendiary\r\nprojectiles actually used in the fifteenth century were comparatively\r\nsimple and of a different nature. Take, for instance, the incendiary\r\ncannon-projectile used at the siege of Weissenburg in 1469, just six\r\nyears after Valturio had presented his book to the Sultan Mahomed\r\nII.[571] It consisted of a stone ball, considerably smaller than the\r\nbore of the gun, which was smeared over with thick incendiary matter\r\nand wrapped in a cloth soaked in the same mixture. This process was\r\ncontinued until the ball was the proper size for the bore.[572] Other\r\nincendiary missiles were tried,[573] but none of them, so far as I am\r\naware, had anything in common with the unpractical projectile proposed\r\nin the Berlin Firebook.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Incendiary Shell._\r\n\r\nA further step is taken in a later edition of the Firebook just quoted,\r\nbut of the same period,[574] 1400-50. A quill full of incendiary\r\nmatter is directed to be inserted in the hole through the ball above\r\ndescribed, and the whole was enclosed in an envelope or shell of\r\nearthenware or iron. An earthenware ball could of course only be thrown\r\nby hand: an iron ball would be fired in general from a bombard. The\r\nmetal shell was formed of two hemispheres of iron fastened together by\r\nbands, with a small hole to admit the flame to the quill. A similar\r\nenvelope, of bronze, is suggested by\r\n\r\nValturio in his _De Re Militari_, 1463, p. 267;[575] but in this case\r\nthe shell is filled with powder, which in all probability was driven\r\nin and compressed as tightly as possible with a mallet and drift.[576]\r\nThe German writer undoubtedly believed that his shell would burst,\r\nfor he uses such phrases as “chugel dye da springt” and “zerspringt\r\nund zerslecht alls umb.” Neither his shell or Valturio’s would have\r\nexploded except under the most exceptional circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of the shell leads Herr von Romocki to suppose that\r\nValturio’s plate is wrong or grievously exaggerated. I see no grounds\r\nfor this suspicion: the shell was purposely made weak, so that it\r\nmight break into two pieces on impact and leave the incendiary charge\r\nfree to do its work. The missile belonged to the same family as the\r\nincendiary projectiles thrown into Roveredo by the Swiss in 1487.[577]\r\nThere the shell was filled with pitch and rosin: Valturio’s shell was\r\ncharged with powder, but it was probably compressed tightly into the\r\ninterior of the shell, and powder, especially serpentine powder,\r\nwill not explode under such circumstances. When experimenting with\r\ngunpowder at New York, Doremus and Budd subjected good modern powder to\r\nsuch hydraulic pressure as to compress it into a solid block without\r\ninterstices, and on ignition the mass burned quietly away.[578]\r\nValturio’s charge was probably reduced to a state approximating more or\r\nless closely to that of the New York powder, and it would have exploded\r\nbut rarely and occasionally. But the mere fact that the shell was made\r\nof bronze is a sufficient proof that it was an incendiary missile.\r\nEven had the charge been explosive, a bronze envelope would have been\r\nonly ripped open by it, not broken into many pieces as iron would have\r\nbeen; a fact which Valturio must have known. Finally, the gunners of\r\nthe fifteenth century were not in possession of a fuze that would have\r\nenabled them to carry on fire with explosive shell. The construction of\r\nsuch a fuze (as will be seen in the section on “Time Fuzes”) was the\r\nwork of the following century.\r\n\r\nThe Berlin Firebook does not profess to give us an account of\r\nammunition actually used in the field; it merely describes certain\r\nammunition proposed for use by a fireworker, or inventor, and it\r\nadds his honest convictions of the way in which it would act if\r\nmanufactured. The excerpts given by Herr von Romocki from the Firebook,\r\nin so far as they concern the projectile in question, are simply the\r\nspecification and opinions of an inventor, and there are no grounds\r\nfor supposing that his missile was ever made or ever tried. If these\r\nprojectiles had been used with effect in the field, their inventor\r\nwould surely have been the first to tell us of their success. There\r\nis nothing remarkable in the above conclusion: the inventor followed\r\nthe custom of his age. The value of experiment generally, the absolute\r\nnecessity for experiment in gunnery, was unknown or altogether\r\nunderrated in the Middle Ages, and those fireworkers who may have\r\nsuspected its importance had neither the money nor the opportunity\r\nto put their theory into practice. Would Sextus Julius Africanus and\r\nMarcus Græcus have bequeathed to us certain preposterous recipes, had\r\nthey been at the pains and expense of making them and trying them?\r\nIt was Roger Bacon who wrote: “Experimental science ignores abstract\r\narguments; because, strong though they may be, their conclusions\r\nare not perfectly certain until verified by experiment.... In these\r\nstudies experiment alone, not abstract reasoning, leads to certain\r\nconclusions.”[579] Yet even he, with his “everlasting lamps,” has\r\nnot quite escaped the infection of the prevailing fashion: he never\r\ntried these lamps. Bourne has left us a whole book of “Inventions\r\nand Devices,” and at least one half of Boillot’s book is occupied by\r\nsimilar inventions; but neither of them makes the slightest suggestion\r\nthat any one of his contrivances was ever made or ever tried. We may,\r\nthen, discard the wholly unpractical proposal of the Berlin Firebook,\r\nand accept Valturio’s as the earliest incendiary cannon-shell of which\r\nwe have any detailed account.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Carcasses._\r\n\r\nCarcasses were invented in 1672 by a gunner in the service of\r\nChristopher van Galen, the fighting Prince Bishop of Munster.[580]\r\nThey are mentioned in the _London Gazette_, 1980/1, 1684. They were\r\noriginally oblong, in order to contain a large quantity of incendiary\r\nmatter; but their flight was so erratic that it became necessary to\r\nmake them spherical. Their thickness was at the same time so much\r\nreduced, in order to increase their internal capacity, that a large\r\nproportion broke up in the bore. To remedy this defect during the siege\r\nof Quebec, 1759, “the interval between the powder and the carcass\r\nwas filled with turf,” an arrangement which “produced every desired\r\neffect.”[581]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Explosive Fireballs._\r\n\r\nExplosive fireballs were simply hand-grenades, which, according to the\r\nclassification of ammunition adopted here, have been already noticed,\r\np. 169.\r\n\r\n_Explosive Shell._\r\n\r\nThe step from Valturio’s shell to common shell may seem to us now to\r\nhave been a short and an easy one, yet it took nearly a century to make\r\nit; the obstacle that barred the way being neither the envelope nor the\r\nbursting charge, but the fuze.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to say exactly when, where, or by whom explosive shell\r\nwere first employed. The want of them had been long felt everywhere,\r\nand numberless attempts to manufacture them were made. They may,\r\ntherefore, have come into being independently in several countries\r\nabout the same period; a supposition which receives considerable\r\nsupport from the conflicting claims which have been set up, quite\r\nhonestly no doubt, to their first employment.\r\n\r\nWe have sound evidence of the manufacture of large mortars and shell\r\nin England as early as 1543. In this year Bawd and Collet constructed\r\nmortars of 11″ to 19″ in calibre, with cast-iron shell “to be\r\nstuffed with fireworks or wildfire,” and a match (_i.e._ fuze) “that\r\nthe firework might be set on fire for to breake in smal pieces,\r\nwhereof the smallest piece hitting any man would kill or spoile\r\nhim.”[582] Stow, to whom we owe these facts, began life as a tailor,\r\nand was not familiar with the intricacies of Artillery _matériel_;\r\nbut it is sufficiently clear that he speaks here of two kinds of\r\nprojectiles—incendiary shell filled with wildfire, and explosive shell\r\nfilled with firework. Whether these shell were ever used and, if so,\r\nwhether their action was successful, there is no evidence to show; but\r\nin 1588 took place the sieges of Bergen-op-Zoom and Wachtendonck at\r\nwhich explosive shell were used with much effect, for the first time\r\naccording to the evidence we at present possess. Reyd, whose _Belgarum\r\naliarumque Gentium Annales_ was published in 1600, tells us (lib.\r\nviii., p. 182) that during the siege of Bergen-op-Zoom “an Italian\r\ndeserter to the Dutch devoted himself to the art, hitherto unknown, of\r\nmaking hollow balls of iron or stone, which, when filled with a certain\r\ncomposition and ignited, burst into innumerable fragments like grape\r\nstones.”[583] Father Strada, S.J., in his _Hist. de la_ _Guerre des\r\nPays Bas, Brussels_, 1739, speaks as follows (iv. 415):—\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: On bat la Ville avec une nouvelle espèce de balles qu’on\r\nnomme Bombes.]\r\n\r\n“Il n’y avoit rien qui épouvantait davantage les assiégés (in\r\nWachtendonck) que de certaines grosses boules de fonte creuses, et\r\nremplies de poudre et d’autres matiéres inextinguibles, qui étant\r\npoussées en l’air avec de gros mortiers, accabloient par leur pésanteur\r\ntous les lieux sur qui ils tombaient, et en même tems, comme le feu\r\ns’y prenoit par des buses qui y étoient attachées, ils rompoient en se\r\ncrévant et embrasoient tout ce qui étoit à l’entour, sans que l’eau le\r\nput éteindre.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: L’inventeur de ces sortes de boulets.]\r\n\r\n“Cette sorte de boulet, que nous avons vû ajoûter aux grenades, aux\r\npots à feu, &c. ... fut, dit on, inventée un peu devant le siége de\r\nWachtendonck par un artisan de Venloo.... Je sais que quelqu’un (_i.e._\r\nReyd) a ecrit qu’une pareille expérience avait été faite a Berg-op-Zoom\r\n... avec un pareil succès par un Italien deserteur des troupes\r\nd’Espagne. Au reste, le Comte Mansfeld se servit de cette machine qui\r\nfut inventée à Venloo et faisoit dans Wachtendonck une déstruction des\r\nmaisons et des hommes aussi inévitable qu’elle étoit inopinée.”\r\n\r\nThese passages possess at least one quality of good evidence—they\r\ndiffer about details and agree on the main points; and it is difficult\r\nto see how they can be gainsaid or overlooked. We may take it, then,\r\nuntil further evidence (which may possibly exist) is produced, that\r\nexplosive shell were first used in large numbers and with good effect\r\nin 1588.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nIGNITERS\r\n\r\n\r\nCharges of incendiaries and explosives confined in guns, shells, mines,\r\n&c., are not fired directly: for convenience and safety they are\r\nignited by means of some intermediate agent, or agents, such as priming\r\npowder, fuzes, &c., which are themselves in turn ignited by some other\r\nagents. These collective agents are here called Igniters.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hot Wires, Priming Powder, Matches, and Portfires._\r\n\r\nThe small early guns, whose recoil was insignificant, seem to have\r\nbeen fired directly by thrusting a hot wire into the powder through\r\nthe vent.[584] When guns grew bigger, this method had to be abandoned\r\nand priming powder came into use.[585] For centuries priming powder\r\nconsisted of serpentine, or some slow-burning mixture, which was at\r\nfirst laid in a train from some convenient spot to the vent, and was\r\nafterwards simply poured on the vent. The advantage of the former\r\nproceeding, in securing the safety of the gunners, is pointed out in a\r\nvery old French book:—“vous pourrez retirer affin que vostre baston\r\n(_gun_) ne vous face dommage.”[586] In the latter case, the priming\r\nwas ignited in various ways:—by a hot wire; by a match fixed in a\r\nlint-stock, which was “a staffe of a yard or two yards long;”[587] and\r\nlater by a portfire attached to a portfire-stick.[588]\r\n\r\nThe objection to priming powder was its liability to be wetted by rain,\r\nor blown away by wind.[589]\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE XII.\r\n\r\n_Matches._\r\n\r\n  +------------------+----------------+----------------+------------------+\r\n  | Chinese.         | Arab.          | English.       | English.         |\r\n  | 13th Century.    | 13th Century.  | 17th Century.  | 20th Century.    |\r\n  +------------------+----------------+----------------+------------------+\r\n  | Cord soaked      | Cord of cotton | “Cottonweeke   | “Cottonwick      |\r\n  | in a mixture     | and palm       | dipped         | boiled in        |\r\n  | of sulphur and   | leaves soaked  | in gunpowder   | a solution of    |\r\n  | water (and well  | in naphtha and | wet with water”| mealed powder    |\r\n  | dried).[590]     | dried.[591]    | and dried.[592]| and gum, and     |\r\n  |                  |                |                | afterwards       |\r\n  |                  |                |                | dusted over      |\r\n  |                  |                |                | with mealed      |\r\n  |                  |                |                | powder before    |\r\n  |                  |                |                | it is dry.[593]  |\r\n  +------------------+----------------+----------------+------------------+\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tubes._\r\n\r\nPriming powder was ultimately replaced by small tubes, full of\r\ncombustible matter, which fitted into the vents of guns. Of the\r\nmultitude of these tubes only a few can be mentioned here. Tubes\r\nfilled with quickmatch, and primed with mealed powder and spirits of\r\nwine, are said to have been in use in the first half of the eighteenth\r\ncentury.[594] In 1778 Captain Sir Charles Douglas, R.N., invented the\r\ngun-flint-lock. It was simply a flint-and-steel apparatus, fastened\r\nto the ventplate of the gun and worked by a lanyard, which ignited a\r\ntube placed in the vent. Captain Douglas introduced this lock into\r\nhis ship, the _Duke_, at his own expense, and it worked so well that\r\nit was officially adopted for the Navy in 1790.[595] It was owing,\r\napparently, to the personal intervention of General Sir Alexander\r\nDickson that this lock was at length adopted for the Artillery in\r\n1820.[596] In a letter to Sir Howard Douglas (son of Sir Charles),\r\n18th April 1818, Sir Alexander gives his reasons for advocating the\r\nchange:—“By the employment of slow match only, the fire is frequently\r\nretarded, and nothing can be more dangerous than lighted portfires in\r\na battery ... I have ever prevented, as much as in my power, the use of\r\nportfires.”[597]\r\n\r\nA percussion tube, invented by Mr. Marsh, of the Royal Arsenal Surgery,\r\nwas approved for the Navy in 1831: the Artillery was not supplied with\r\na similar tube until 1846.\r\n\r\nIn 1841 Lieutenant Siemens, of the Hanoverian Army, laid a friction\r\ntube before the officials of Woolwich Arsenal, which was tried and,\r\nowing to whatever defects, was rejected. Just ten years later Mr.\r\nTozer, of the Royal Laboratory, made the copper friction tube now in\r\nuse. It was officially adopted in 1853.[598]\r\n\r\nIn 1860 there were no less than six tubes in the service:—(1) the\r\nCommon Quill Tube; (2) the Dutch Paper Tube; (3) the Common Metal Tube;\r\n(4) the Percussion Tube; (5) the Friction Tube; and (6) the Galvanic\r\nTube.[599]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Time Fuzes._\r\n\r\nNothing can be less satisfactory than Hassan er-Rammah’s allusions to\r\nigniters, of which he possessed two—the _rose_ and the _ikreekh_ (اكريج).\r\nThe latter word strictly means a duct, channel, or tube; but just as\r\nwe frequently use _fuze_ for _fuze composition_, so the Arabs often\r\nuse _ikreekh_ for the composition it contained. Hassan, for instance,\r\nspeaks of “the sulphur with which one makes ikreekhs.”[600] It is\r\nquite clear, however, from Reinaud and Favé’s Plate II., fig. 24, that\r\nthe ikreekh was of the nature of a fuze-case. Whether the composition\r\ngiven here in column 1 of Table XIII. was used in the ikreekh or the\r\nrose, I do not know. In fact our knowledge of these two igniters may\r\nbe summed up in the statement that they were used together in the same\r\n(incendiary) shell, and that it was the rose which was lighted.[601]\r\nThe ikreekh possibly contained the fuze composition proper, and the\r\nrose corresponded to our priming matter.\r\n\r\nJudging from the plates of Kyeser’s _Bellifortis_ reproduced by Herr\r\nvon Romocki (i. 169), the igneous projectiles of 1405 were ignited by\r\nsome slow-burning composition, which was put on the top of the charge,\r\nand filled up the loading hole flush with the exterior of the missile.\r\nThe breech-loading quill fuze of the second Berlin Firebook, mentioned\r\nin the section on “Explosive Shell,” seems to have been only the\r\nabortive proposal of an inventor.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing Arab and German igniters were for use in machine and hand\r\nprojectiles, and we now reach cannon fuzes.\r\n\r\nThe first igneous gun-missiles were incendiary, at once hand-grenades\r\nand cannon-balls, and were ignited by means of some slow-burning\r\nmixture, without a case, which was put into the shell on the top of its\r\ncharge. When the missile is “neere full (of good come pouder),” says\r\nBourne, “take some receite of soft fire worke that will not burne too\r\nhastily and fill up the rest of the ball.”[602] That the fuze-hole was\r\noriginally placed next the cartridge is shown by Boillot’s repeated\r\ndirections to turn it towards the muzzle[603]—directions which would\r\nhave been superfluous had it not been previously customary to place\r\nit next the cartridge; and by many other indications. By this mode of\r\nloading the ignition of the fuze composition was ensured before the\r\nprojectile left the piece. There was perhaps no absolute necessity for\r\nthe use of this soft, slow-burning mixture, with incendiary shell so\r\nplaced; but it was probably found very useful in confining the charge\r\nwithin the missile during flight.\r\n\r\nThe need of an explosive projectile to blow up earthworks, &c., was\r\nmore and more felt as time rolled on, and the use of such missiles\r\nwas clearly impossible with such igniters so placed. But the best way\r\nof mending matters was by no means so clear. If an explosive shell\r\nwas placed in the bore with an igniter of soft, caseless composition\r\nnext the cartridge, there was in the great majority of rounds a burst\r\nin the bore. If the shell was reversed, with the igniter towards the\r\nface of the piece, either the composition did not ignite and the\r\nshell was blind, or the soft composition set back into the shell from\r\nthe shock of the explosion[604] and again there was a burst in the\r\nbore. Furthermore, in firing against works it was before all things\r\nnecessary that the shell should enter the revetment, &c., before it\r\nexploded, and it was extremely difficult in practice to put into the\r\nshell the exact amount of composition that would burn just longer\r\nthan the time of flight. To prevent the gases of the explosion from\r\nforcing their way into the interior of the shell, it was necessary\r\nto have the fuze-hole towards the muzzle when the shell was home. To\r\nprevent the soft composition from setting back, and to ensure that it\r\nwas sufficient in quantity to burn longer than the time of flight, a\r\nfuze-case was necessary. To ensure the ignition of the fuze (in its new\r\nposition) it was necessary to light it from the muzzle just before the\r\npiece was fired, and this condition restricted the use of explosive\r\nshell for centuries to mortars and (afterwards) howitzers. No one would\r\nhave dared to thrust a lit match down the bore of a gun which had been\r\nloaded with loose powder by means of a ladle, and cartridges were not\r\nin general use when the question of explosive shell arose. Bourne\r\nsays in 1587: “It is a great deal better for to charge a peace in time\r\nof service with a cartredge than with a ladell,”[605] and he presently\r\nproceeds to give his reasons for thinking so at great length.[606] In\r\nthe beginning of the following century, Diego Ufano only allows the use\r\nof cartridges when a ladle is not at hand.\r\n\r\nSuch were the steps of the evolution of the fuze, as partially\r\nexplained by Hanzelet and Thybovrel in their _Receuil de plusieurs\r\nMachines Militaires_, published in 1620: “Le souspirail de l’amorce\r\n(the funnel of the priming = the fuze-case) est long ... et creux....\r\nAinsi ce canal éstant emply de composition lente, il ne permet que le\r\nfeu se prenne qu’il nait (n’ait) lentement consumé la matière mise\r\naudit canal, et par ce moyen le feu ne peut toucher la poudre grainée\r\n(the bursting charge) qu’il ne soit arrivé jusques au fond de la ditte\r\ngrenade. Cela sert pour avoir loisir de la jetter à la main, ou de\r\nl’allumer et la mettre dans le mortier ou canon” (l. iv. c. 6).\r\n\r\nOne of the first indications of a fuze with a case is afforded by\r\na passage in Stow’s “Annals” for the year 1543, where he speaks of\r\n“hollow shot of cast-yron, to be stuffed with fireworks or wild fire;\r\nwhereof the bigger sort had screwes of yron to receive a match”\r\n(p. 584). Stow was evidently describing something which he did not\r\nunderstand, but his meaning is made clear by Boillot. The fuze-case\r\nwas a hollow, cylindrical male screw which fitted a female screw in the\r\nfuze-hole, and when fixed extended across the cavity of the shell: “En\r\nlaquelle (the shell) laisserez un trou ... auquelle ferés faire une\r\nviz pour le bien boucher, laquelle sera de la longeur de la grenade”\r\n(p. 163). Further on he speaks of the case as “un tuyau de fer blanc\r\nou cuivre ... bien adjousté au dit trou,” and directs it to be filled\r\n“bien massif de pouldre sans graine.” It was lighted from the muzzle\r\nof the mortar by a quick-match or hand-fuze,[607] as Nye directs half\r\na century afterwards—light the fuze first, “and then with great speed\r\ngive fire to the touch-hole” (chap. v.).\r\n\r\nDiego Ufano describes experiments carried on during the latter years\r\nof the sixteenth, or the early years of the seventeenth century, with\r\ncased fuzes of a new patterns[608] proposed by the (then) Governor of\r\nGenappe. The fuze, which was filled with moist powder or one of several\r\nmixtures given by Ufano, was placed next the cartridge.[609] The first\r\nshell fired burst at the muzzle, the second burst short. Two rounds\r\nwere then fired from an English 60-pr. (_carthaunen_), both of which\r\nburst in the air and damaged houses and walls in their neighbourhood.\r\nA third shell lodged in the ground at a distance of 250 yards,[610]\r\nand on bursting sent its fragments back towards the gun, damaging a\r\nguard-room[611] which stood 150 yards in rear of it. The experiments\r\nthen ceased, on the urgent representations of an Artillery officer\r\nabout the risk they were all running. The earlier fuzes implicitly\r\nreferred to by Ufano were doubtless the “buses” which, Father Strada\r\ntells us, were employed at Wachtendonck in 1588. Their name, buses =\r\ntubes or pipes, is sufficient proof that they were fuzes with cases. In\r\nhis “Gunner,” 1628, p. 156, Norton speaks of a “pype primed with slow\r\nreceipt” for exploding shell. We find the very same word applied to\r\nfuzes in Danish official documents in 1644: “piber til Granater,” pipes\r\nfor shell.[612] Writing three years afterwards, Nye, Master-Gunner of\r\nWorcester, speaks familiarly of _fuzes_ which were conical in shape,\r\nfor he compares them to “faucets for a spigot.”[613] He says: “The\r\nmatch doth ofttimes fail, but fuzes are very certain to give fire.”\r\n\r\nThere were no means of regulating the time of burning of these pipes,\r\nwhich were generally metallic. The composition had a constant (and\r\nunalterable) length, corresponding roughly to that required for the\r\n_maximum_ range at which shell could be fired. Whatever the range,\r\nthe oblong bombs were fired with a fuze that burned some fourteen\r\nseconds, answering to about 1000 yards range; the spherical grenados\r\nwith a fuze that burned some twenty seconds, answering to about 2100\r\nyards range.[614] In firing against works, &c., it was essential that\r\nmortar shell—and until the siege of Gibraltar, 1779, all shell were\r\nmortar or howitzer shell[615]—should not burst before impact. A shell\r\nwhich burst in flight was a shell wasted, but it mattered little\r\nwhether it burst on impact or a few seconds afterwards.[616] But it was\r\noccasionally necessary to use shell against troops, and it was then\r\nthat the radical defect of the tube became fully manifest. In this case\r\nit was desirable that the fuze should fire the bursting charge the\r\ninstant the shell touched the ground,[617] and this was impracticable\r\nwith the primitive pipe. While the long fuze was burning down to\r\nits end, the explosion might be prevented, or its effects might be\r\nneutralised in many ways. The shell might be thrown bodily into a pond\r\nor the sea;[618] the fuze might be extracted;[619] or it might be\r\nextinguished with water.[620] But in the vast majority of cases the\r\nexplosion of the shell was neutralised in a much homelier and less\r\nheroic way; those near whom it fell waited for no command to quit its\r\nneighbourhood in all haste.\r\n\r\nIt was long before any real progress was made in the adjustment of\r\nfuzes to burn a certain time, chiefly because the early gunners had no\r\ntimekeeper. A striking illustration of this fact is found in the _Artis\r\nMagnæ Artilleriæ_, &c., of Siemienowicz, published in 1650. Wishing\r\nto give his readers an idea of the action of a certain fireball, he\r\nexplains that it burned in the time one takes to recite deliberately\r\nthe Apostles’ Creed.[621]\r\n\r\nThe first, so far as is known, who urged the adjustment of fuzes was\r\nSebastian Hälle,[622] in 1596, and he fared as fare most of those who\r\nsee further than their fellows. The many failed to see the object\r\nwhich he saw clearly; therefore (they said) the object did not exist,\r\nand he was a dreamer. A century after his death, however, gunners\r\nbegan to discover that his dreams were substantial enough; and in 1682\r\nZeug-Lieut. Buchner dilates upon the advantages of a fuze that will\r\nburn _ein gewiss Tempo_[623]—a certain time. The mere fact that there\r\nwere at least three different kinds of fuze in use towards the close of\r\nthe seventeenth century—paper, wood, and iron[624]—proves that the\r\nsearch for a serviceable fuze was going actively forward. The excellent\r\nplates given by Buchner and Mieth show clearly that their fuzes were\r\nbored. In both cases the rate of burning was tested with difficulty,\r\nowing to the want of a practical timekeeper. Buchner recommends the use\r\nof a pendulum, or very careful beating time (or counting);[625] Mieth\r\nalludes to the pendulum, but evidently put little trust in it, for he\r\nadds, “The correct time can be only found by trial shell.”[626]\r\n\r\nBy the middle of the eighteenth century we had beechwood fuzes, which\r\nwere cut. The rate of burning was determined “by burning two or three,\r\nand making use of a watch or string by way of pendulum.”[627] It was\r\nobserved about this period that when fuzes were cut very short, either\r\nthe flame failed to reach the bursting charge and the shell went blind,\r\nor the thin disc of fuze composition set back into the shell from the\r\nshock of the discharge and the shell burst in the bore. To obviate\r\nthis Muller proposed to provide special fuzes, with a quicker-burning\r\ncomposition than usual, for use at short ranges.[628] This plan was\r\ntemporarily adopted, for we find that there were three different\r\nfuzes in our service in 1779, one that burned an inch in 5 seconds, a\r\nsecond that burned an inch in 4.5 seconds, and a third that burned an\r\ninch in 4 seconds. It is evident, however, from a remark made by the\r\nInspector of the Royal Military Academy, Captain George Smith, R.A.,\r\nin his “Universal Military Dictionary” (from which these details have\r\nbeen taken) that the standard of shell fire in the year 1779 was a\r\nlow one. “When the distance of the battery from the object is known,\r\nthe time of the shell’s flight may be computed to a second or two.”\r\nExtreme regularity of burning, then, was not expected: an error of “a\r\nsecond or two” in the time of flight was of trivial importance. But an\r\nevent happened in Gibraltar in this very year which suddenly raised\r\nthe standard to a height that no one could have foreseen—the adoption\r\nof Captain Mercier’s method of shell-fire from guns, with short fuzes.\r\nThis system ended with the siege; it was never resorted to, probably,\r\noutside the gates of Gibraltar; and, more probably still, when the\r\nsiege was over things fell gradually back into the unruffled quiet of\r\nroutine. But the calm was only momentary, for in 1803 appeared Shrapnel\r\nshell, and with them reappeared Captain Mercier’s forgotten system of\r\n“calculated fuzes.”\r\n\r\nFrom the first moment it was beyond all doubt that the ultimate success\r\nof Shrapnel could be only assured by the use of what no Artillery then\r\npossessed—a thoroughly good time-fuze. Writing to Major (afterwards\r\nGeneral Sir Thomas) Downman, R.A., on the 29th Feb. 1804, Shrapnel\r\nremarks that in firing at short ranges the fuze composition “gives\r\nway into the shell once in ten times,”[629] thus producing a burst\r\nin the bore; and as a remedy he suggests cutting all fuzes 1¼″\r\nlong and then sawing a cut through the bottom of the fuze, in a plane\r\npassing through its longer axis, _up_ to the desired length. However,\r\nnotwithstanding all precautions, of the 1090 shell fired during the\r\nWoolwich experiments with Shrapnel in 1819, 74 burst in the bore, 71\r\nburst in the butt, and 111 were blind, _i.e._ 23.4 per cent. were\r\nfailures.[630] No efforts were spared to improve these fuzes or replace\r\nthem by better ones, and a large number were proposed, or constructed,\r\nduring the second quarter of the last century. In 1850 there were no\r\nless than nineteen time-fuzes in our service: three of metal and\r\nsixteen of wood. Of the latter, ten were Shrapnel fuzes, viz. an 8″, a\r\n5½″ and a 1″ fuze, which were uncut; and seven fuzes which were cut\r\nready for use, and lettered A for .1″, B for .2″,—G for .7″.[631]\r\nThis medley of fuzes was gradually superseded by a wooden time-fuze\r\nproposed in 1849 by an officer who had a genius for ammunition, Captain\r\n(afterwards General) E. M. Boxer, R.A., and adopted in 1850. In the\r\nfinal pattern of this fuze, adopted early in 1854, England possessed\r\nprobably the best fuze in Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE XIII.\r\n\r\n_Time-Fuze Composition._\r\n\r\n  +---------+----------+------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+------------+-------------+\r\n  |         |Arab.[632]|German.[633]|English.[634]|Swedish.[635]|English.[636]|German.[637]|English.[638]|\r\n  |         | Late     | Late       | Early       | Late        | Middle      | Early      | 20th        |          |\r\n  |         | 13th     | 16th       | 17th        | 17th        | 18th        | 19th       | Century.    |\r\n  |         | Century. | Century.   | Century.    | Century.    | Century.    | Century.   |             |\r\n  +---------+----------+------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+------------+-------------+\r\n  |Saltpetre|  71.43   |    52.1    |     69.8    |    69.85    |    75.0     |    72.1    |    76.4     |\r\n  |Charcoal |  21.43   |    25.6    |     12.7    |      .5     |    6.25     |   10.7     |    14.1     |\r\n  |Sulphur  |   7.14   |    22.3    |     17.5    |    21.65    |   18.75     |   17.2     |     9.5     |\r\n  +---------+----------+------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+------------+-------------+\r\n\r\n\r\n_Percussion and Concussion Fuzes._\r\n\r\nThe earliest proposal for igniting the bursting charges of shell by\r\npercussion appears to have been made in 1596 by Sebastian Hälle.[639]\r\nA similar proposal was made in 1610 by Graf Johann von Nassau in a MS.\r\nnow in possession of the Royal Library, Berlin (MS. Germ. fol. 4),\r\nwhere two hand-grenades are described which explode on being let fall\r\non the ground. The second differs from the first in having a safety\r\napparatus to prevent premature explosions, but both are based on the\r\nsame principle as Hälle’s: flints and steel so arranged as to strike\r\ntogether on impact with the ground.[640] In 1650 Siemienowicz gives\r\na description (with plates) of similar grenades, without a safety\r\narrangement,[641] which Mieth regarded as “curiosities” specially\r\nadapted to hurry those who meddled with them into the next world.[642]\r\nYet Buchner mentions them in 1682,[643] and Anderson in 1691,[644]\r\nwithout any (expressed) misgivings of their danger. We may rest assured\r\nthat these man-traps were never used on actual service.\r\n\r\nThe use of percussion powder to ignite the bursting charges of shells\r\nwas first definitely proposed, I believe, by Johann Jürgenson von\r\nTrachenfels in 1655;[645] just seven years after Glauber had drawn\r\nattention to such mixtures in his _Philosophischen Öfen_.[646]\r\nTrachenfels’ proposals were never put into practice, and no attempt was\r\nmade to apply percussion powders to military purposes for more than a\r\ncentury. Fulminating silver, discovered by Berthollet towards the close\r\nof the eighteenth century, could not be utilised owing to the violence\r\nof its detonation. After Howard’s discovery of fulminating mercury in\r\n1800, a number of percussion mixtures were made; but seven years passed\r\nbefore Rev. Alexander Forsyth proposed to use them for the priming\r\nof firearms,[647] and eleven years more elapsed before it occurred\r\nto Colonel Peter Hawker to enclose percussion priming in a copper\r\ncap.[648] The percussion musket did not make its appearance until 1842.\r\n\r\nThe first English concussion fuze[649] was invented by Quartermaster\r\nFreeburn, R.A., in 1846; the first percussion fuze by Commander\r\nMoorsom, R.N., in 1850.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nSIGNALS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following tables tell their own tale:—\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE XIV.\r\n\r\n_Signal Rockets._\r\n\r\n  +--------------+-------------+-----------+----------+-------------+-------------+\r\n  |              |Chinese.[650]|Greek.[651]|Arab.[652]|English.[653]|English.[654]|\r\n  |              |    13th     |   13th    |  13th    |    17th     |    20th     |\r\n  |              |  Century.   | Century.  | Century. |  Century.   |  Century.   |\r\n  +--------------+-------------+-----------+----------+-------------+-------------+\r\n  |  Saltpetre   |    61.0     |   69.2    |   69.5   |     60.0    |    61.6     |\r\n  |   Charcoal   |    18.3     |   23      |   15.7   |     25.5’   |     23      |\r\n  |   Sulphur    |    18.3     |   7.8     |   14.8   |     14.4’   |    15.4     |\r\n  | Mi-to-sing?  |    2.4      |    --     |    --    |      --     |     --      |\r\n  +--------------+-------------+-----------+----------+-------------+-------------+\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE XV.\r\n\r\n_Fixed Lights._\r\n\r\n  +--------------+----------------+------------------------+\r\n  |              |    Arab.[655]  |      English.[656]     |\r\n  |              |  “Light of the | “Light, Illuminating   |\r\n  |              |     Moon,”     |   Wrecks, Mark IV.,”   |\r\n  |              | 13th Century.  |     20th Century.      |\r\n  +--------------+----------------+------------------------+\r\n  |  Saltpetre   |      71.4      |           72           |\r\n  |   Charcoal   |      15.2      |           21           |\r\n  |   Orpiment   |      13.4      |          6.7           |\r\n  +--------------+----------------+------------------------+\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE XVI\r\n\r\n_Fireworks._\r\n\r\n  +--------------------+----------------+--------------+\r\n  |                    |    Arab.[657]  | English.[658]|\r\n  |                    |Golden Garlands,|Tourbillions, |\r\n  |                    | 13th Century.  |20th Century. |\r\n  +--------------------+----------------+--------------+\r\n  | Saltpetre          |      62.5      |      58      |\r\n  | Charcoal           |       25       |      12      |\r\n  | Sulphur            |      6.25      |      13      |\r\n  | Steel filings      |     3.125      |     4.8      |\r\n  | Cast iron borings  |      --        |     12.2     |\r\n  | Bronze filings     |     3.125      |      --      |\r\n  +--------------------+----------------+--------------+\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Escorial MS., No. 1249, given in Casiri’s _Bibliotheca\r\nArabico-Hispana Escur._, ii. 7.\r\n\r\n[2] _Hist. du Roy Saint Loys_, Paris, 1668, p. 39.

But, like so many\r\nother words, it completely changed its meaning in the lapse of years.\r\nAbd Allah used it to designate saltpetre: Pliny the elder (“Nat.\r\nHist.,” xxxvi. 17) tells us it had the property of utterly consuming\r\ndead bodies, except the teeth, in forty days—a property saltpetre does\r\nnot possess.\r\n\r\n[36] _Majus Opus_, London, 1733, p. 474.\r\n\r\n[37] See chapter iv.\r\n\r\n[38] This process was carried out in the East, or wherever the natural\r\nsaltpetre was collected; not at Waltham Abbey. The facts are taken from\r\nthe “Handbook of the Manufacture of Gunpowder,” by Capt. F. M. Smith,\r\nR.A., London, 1871.\r\n\r\n[39] F´, &c., means a repetition of F, &c.\r\n\r\n[40] See chapter iv., recipe 14.\r\n\r\n[41] Taken from Reinaud and Favé, p. 237.\r\n\r\n[42] _i.e._ the lapis assius = saltpetre.\r\n\r\n[43] The way in which this process has been obtained will be explained\r\nin chapter viii.

Of course I do not mean to say that it\r\nwas not invented in other parts also.” It is explicitly noticed in\r\na Chinese Encyclopædia finished in A.D. 121 (Sir J. Davis, “The\r\nChinese,” &c., ii 185). But Chinese chronology is always suspicious,\r\nand, even if this date be correct, there is no evidence to show that\r\nthe invention ever reached the West. The Chinese seem to have guarded\r\ntheir discoveries and inventions with a jealous eye. Their valuable\r\nand accurate astronomical observations were only laid open to Europe\r\nby the Jesuits, more than two thousand years after they were made. The\r\nprinting press was not invented in Europe until the fifteenth century,\r\nyet Feng Tao had invented block-printing in China in the tenth (Giles’\r\n“Chinese Literature,” p. 210). According to their own account, the\r\nChinese have used tea since the year 2737 B.C. It was not heard of in\r\nEurope until after A.D. 1517, and did not become generally known until\r\nthe seventeenth century. Brunetto Latini (1230-94), quoted by Davis,\r\ngives a curious, but only too probable a reason for the slow progress\r\nof the compass in Christendom: “No master mariner dares to use (it),\r\nlest he should fall under the suspicion of being a magician.”\r\n\r\n[252] Ferishta, “Hist. of the Rise of Mahomedan Power,” &c., trans. by\r\nGeneral J.

Babar’s ironical description of the Bengalis\r\nas gunners is taken quite seriously by some writers: “The Bengalis are\r\nfamous for their skill in Artillery.... They do not direct their fire\r\nagainst a particular point, but discharge at random,” Elliot, iv. 285.\r\nSuch a procedure is not altogether unknown in Europe. When shooting,\r\nMr. Tracy Tupman was wont to shut his eyes firmly and fire in the air.\r\n\r\nWere these gunners friendly Bengalis employed by Babar, or hostile\r\nBengalis working their own guns? If the latter, their guns were\r\nprobably made by Portuguese deserters. We know that two artisans\r\ndeserted in 1503 to the Zamorin of Calicut, for whom they offered to\r\nmake guns of the same nature as the Portuguese, “which they afterwards\r\ndid.” Castenheda in Kerr’s “Collection of Voyages,” ii. 454, quoted in\r\nElliot, vi. 467.\r\n\r\n[278] The 71 grs. avoir. given to the _miskal_ by Burton and Clarke\r\n(“Persian Handbook”) would make Babar’s large shot weigh 50 lbs.—an\r\nimpossible weight, as every officer will admit who remembers our 18\r\nPr. S.B. bullock batteries in India. Babar could not have dragged 50\r\nPrs. from Caubul to Panipat. Burton admits that the miskal “varies\r\neverywhere.” “Arab.

Other MSS. read “sal.”\r\n\r\n[346] “Tere ipsum fortiter cum aqua salis communis.... Ablue in aceto\r\nacerrimo.” The section “Nitri Separatio” of “Aristoteles, de Perfecto\r\nMagisterio,” in the _Theatrum Chemicum_, ed. by Zetzner; a collection\r\nof alchemical tracts of the Middle Ages, iii. 68.\r\n\r\n[347] Almost literally translated by Whiteborne: “clarified and from\r\nearthe and grosse matter diligently purged.” See A, p. 21.\r\n\r\n[348] _i.e._ the lapis Assius = saltpetre. We have here unmistakably a\r\n_verbum œnigmaticum_. The efflorescence of the stone of Assos, which\r\nwas unknown to the crowd, was of course “not a stone,” although called\r\nso. The philosopher’s stone, which was well known by name to the crowd,\r\nwas likewise “not a stone,” although called so:—\r\n\r\n“... ’tis a stone And not a stone; a spirit, a soul, and a body.”\r\n\r\n—Jonson’s “Alchemist.”\r\n\r\nBacon avails himself of the ambiguity of the phrase, “stone which is\r\nnot a stone,” to support the delusion created by the title of the\r\nchapter, and confirm the unwary in the belief that the philosopher’s\r\nstone is under discussion, instead of saltpetre.\r\n\r\n[349] He passes suddenly from chalk to cheese—yellow cheese, laughing\r\nopenly in his reader’s face.\r\n\r\n[350] _i.e._ the cleansed natural saltpetre.\r\n\r\n[351] “Put the jar on a gentle fire.”—Hassan, A, p. 24.\r\n\r\n[352] “The mother liquid is boiled until the scum ceases to\r\nrise.”—Waltham Abbey process, C, p. 19.\r\n\r\n[353] “Clear and fair and of an azure colour.”—Whitehorne, F, p. 21.\r\n\r\n[354] _i.e._ the scum and impurities.\r\n\r\n[355] _i.e._ “to drie throughly.”—Whitehorne, I, p. 22.\r\n\r\n[356] This repetition corresponds with Whitehorne’s second process;\r\nbeginning at F´, p. 22.\r\n\r\n[357] _i.e._ the crystals just obtained.\r\n\r\n[358] A powder to purge, or to purify and clarify. “Prenez de la chaulx\r\nvive et de l’eau de pluye ... et les brouïllez bien ensemble, et\r\npuis le laissez reposer ... et se fera forte lexive.... Prenez de la\r\nlexive dessus dicte, et mettez vostre salpetre dedans,” &c. “Livre de\r\nCanonnerie,” &c., which although not published until 1561, appears to\r\nbelong to the end of the fifteenth century.—In Reinaud and Favé, pp.\r\n146-7.\r\n\r\n[359] Bacon does not name the two substances he alludes to, but\r\nWhitehome names two and prescribes the same proportions: “Two parts of\r\nunslacked lime and three of oke asshes.”—See A, p. 21. Did Whitehorne\r\nhave access to Bacon’s MSS.?\r\n\r\n[360] Treating ostensibly on gold, Bacon is obliged to use _resolve_\r\nfor _dissolve_.\r\n\r\n[361] The alchemical preparation of gold had much in common with the\r\nrefining of saltpetre. In the “Nitri Preparatio” of Bernard’s and\r\nPenoti’s _Theatrum Chemicum_, iii. 78, we read: “Fac postmodum de eo\r\nper omnia ut dicam in preparatione auri, id est, destilla per alambicum\r\net congela,” &c.\r\n\r\n[362] _i.e._ to the laxative.\r\n\r\n[363] A _verbum œnigmaticum_. The Phœnix is a singular animal, as Bacon\r\njustly observes, inasmuch as it springs from its own _ashes_. Its name,\r\ntherefore, may be figuratively used with perfect propriety to denote\r\n_animal charcoal_, an efficacious agent in clarifying solutions of\r\nimpure saltpetre.—Bloxam’s “Chemistry,” 8th ed., p. 488.\r\n\r\n[364] Bacon appears to have poured the hot solution upon the laxative,\r\nprecisely as Clarke directs in his “Natural History of Nitre,” London,\r\n1670, p. 42: “Pour the hot liquid on ashes ... ’tis no matter how soon\r\nyou let it run off the ashes again.”\r\n\r\n[365] _i.e._ the removal of the insoluble impurities.\r\n\r\n[366] “Then pour it into the other jar.”—Hassan, A, p. 24.\r\n\r\n[367] _i.e._ into a crystallising jar.\r\n\r\n[368] “The solution is kept in constant agitation by poles while\r\ncooling.”—Waltham Abbey Regs., H, p. 20.\r\n\r\n[369] “The mother liquid, from which the saltpetre flour has been\r\ndeposited, is boiled down and crystallised.”—Bloxam’s “Chemistry,” 8th\r\ned., p. 488.\r\n\r\n[370] _Salit petræ_ is the reading of Zetzner’s _Theatrum Chemicum_,\r\n1613, v. 962, which is adopted by Reinaud and Favé, p. 123; of Manget’s\r\n_Bibliotheca Chemica_, 1702, i. 624; of the _Verosimilia Sacra et\r\nProfana_ of Hoven and Molfenger, 1732, ii. 93; and of the copy used by\r\nRomocki, i. 93. Prof. Brewer’s MS. reads _sal petræ_.\r\n\r\n[371] “Atque mala vites incidere falce _novellas_.”—Vergil, “Bucol.,”\r\niii. 11. The word, however, may be simply _novæ_.\r\n\r\n[372] “Maltha, quæ est genus bitumenis.”—_Opus Majus_, London, 1733,\r\np. 474.\r\n\r\n[373] “Possumus artificialiter componere ignem comburentem,\r\nscilicet, ex sale petræ ... ex oleo petroleo ... ex maltha et\r\nnaphta et consimilibus.... His vicinus est ignis græcus et multa\r\ncomburentia.”—_De Secretis_, cap. vi.\r\n\r\n[374] “Maltha ... projecta super hominem armatum comburit eum.... Ignis\r\ncomburens fit ex eo qui cum difficultate potest extingui, nam aqua non\r\nextinguit.”—_Op. Maj._, as above.\r\n\r\n[375] “Sunt alia stupenda naturæ. Nam soni velut tonitrua et\r\ncoruscationes fieri possunt in aere; imo majori horrore quam illa quæ\r\nfiunt per naturam. Nam modica materia adaptata, scilicet ad quantitatem\r\nunius pollicis, sonum facit horribilem et coruscationem ostendit\r\nvehementem.”—_De Secretis_, cap. vi.\r\n\r\n[376] See p. 156.\r\n\r\n[377] “Quaedam vero auditum perturbant.... Nullus tonitrui fragor\r\nposset talibus comparari. Quædam tantum terrorem visui incutiunt, quod\r\ncoruscationes nubium longe minus et sine comparatione perturbant....\r\nExperimentum hujus rei capimus ex hoc ludicro puerili, quod fit in\r\nmultis mundi partibus, scilicet ut instrumento facto ad quantitatem\r\npollicis humani ex violentia illius salis qui sal petrae vocatur,\r\ntam horribilis sonus nascitur in ruptura tam modicæ rei, scilicet\r\nmodici pergameni, quod fortis tonitrui sentiatur excedere rugitum,\r\net coruscationem maximam sui luminis jubar excedit.”—_Opus\r\nMajus_, London, 1733, p. 474. “Offenbar ist hier das Schiesspulver\r\nverstanden.”—L. Schneider, “Roger Bacon,” 1873, p. 110. Two centuries\r\nbefore, when referring to Bacon’s remarks on the destruction of the\r\nMidianites by Gideon, Borrichius had said: “Hic apertissime loquitur\r\nBacon de nitrato illo sclopetorum pulvere.”—_De Ortu &c., Chemiæ_,\r\n1668, p. 126.\r\n\r\n[378] This is M. Berthelot’s view; _Sur la Force des Matières\r\nExplosives_, Paris, 1883, ii. 358; and it is probably the right one.\r\n\r\n[379]\r\n\r\n... δυσμαχώτατον τέρας· ὁς δὴ κεραυνοῦ κρείσσον’ εὑρήσει φλόγα, βροντάς\r\nθ’ ὑπερβάλλοντα καρτερὸν κτύπον.\r\n\r\n—ÆSCHYLUS, _Prometheus Vinctus_, 921.\r\n\r\n[380] “State Papers,” Domestic Series, 1581-90.\r\n\r\n[381] “Archæologia,” xiii. 27, 397-400.

The\r\n15½″ mortar, under Firemaster Thomas Wright, which accompanied a\r\nsmall force sent by Cromwell in 1651 to reduce the Royalist castle of\r\nElizabeth in Jersey, may have been one of Bawd and Collet’s. Between\r\nfive and ten rounds were fired daily for several days without any\r\ndamage to the piece, although the carriage broke down completely on\r\ntwo occasions. The range was 1540 yards, and the shooting accurate.\r\nThe first round, we may feel certain, was laid with extreme care. “I\r\nproffered to lay a wager of ten pounds with Captain Dover,” says the\r\nFiremaster, “that my first shot should strike the Castle, ... and by\r\nGod’s providence it did strike one side of the great Tower, where\r\nthe Granado brake” (_i.e._ exploded). The second shell “brake verie\r\nkindly,” and for the third he “altered (the) degrees of elevation.”\r\nCaptain Dover may have paid his bet, but the Ordnance Office forgot\r\nto remit Wright’s pay; hence the “Perfect Narrative of the Particular\r\nService performed by Firemaster Thomas Wright,” &c. &c., 1651.
