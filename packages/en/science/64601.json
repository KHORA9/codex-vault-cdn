The general plan of the\r\nparts on physiology and general morphology remains unchanged. A number\r\nof the chapters in the physiological part are practically untouched,\r\nwhile others are thoroughly revised and considerable new matter is\r\nadded, especially on the subjects of nutrition and digestion. The\r\nprincipal chapters on general morphology are unchanged or only slightly\r\nmodified, the greatest change being in a revision of the subject of\r\nthe morphology of fertilization in the gymnosperms and angiosperms in\r\norder to bring this subject abreast of the discoveries of the past few\r\nyears. One of the greatest modifications has been in the addition of\r\nchapters on the classification of the algæ and fungi with studies of\r\nadditional examples for the benefit of those schools where the time\r\nallowed for the first year’s course makes desirable the examination of\r\na broader range of representative plants. The classification is also\r\ncarried out with greater definiteness, so that the regular sequence\r\nof classes, orders, and families is given at the close of each of the\r\nsubkingdoms. Thus all the classes, all the orders (except a few in the\r\nalgæ), and many of the families, are given for the algæ, fungi, mosses,\r\nliverworts, pteridophytes, gymnosperms, and angiosperms.\r\n\r\nBut by far the greatest improvement has been in the complete\r\nreorganization, rewriting, and elaboration of the part dealing with\r\necology, which has been made possible by studies of the past few years,\r\nso that the subject can be presented in a more logical and coherent\r\nform. As a result the subject-matter of the book falls naturally into\r\nthree parts, which may be passed in review as follows:\r\n\r\nPart I. _Physiology._ This deals with the life processes of plants,\r\nas absorption, transpiration, conduction, photosynthesis, nutrition,\r\nassimilation, digestion, respiration, growth, and irritability. Since\r\nprotoplasm is fundamental to all the life work of the plant, this\r\nsubject is dealt with first, and the student is led through the study\r\nof, and experimentation with, the simpler as well as some of the higher\r\nplants, to a general understanding of protoplasm and the special way in\r\nwhich it enables the plant to carry on its work and to adjust itself to\r\nthe conditions of its existence. This study also serves the purpose of\r\nfamiliarizing the pupil with some of the lower and unfamiliar plants.\r\n\r\nSome teachers will prefer to begin the study with general morphology\r\nand classification, thus studying first the representatives of the\r\ngreat groups of plants, and others will prefer to dwell first on the\r\necological aspects of vegetation. This can be done in the use of this\r\nbook by beginning with Part II or with Part III.\r\n\r\nBut the author believes that morphology can best be comprehended after\r\na general study of life processes and functions of the different parts\r\nof plants, including in this study some of the lower forms of plant\r\nlife where some of these processes can more readily be observed. The\r\npupil is then prepared for a more intelligent consideration of general\r\nand comparative morphology and relationships. Even more important is\r\na first study of physiology before taking up the subject of ecology.\r\nThe great value to be derived from a study of plants in their relation\r\nto environment lies in the ability to interpret the different states,\r\nconditions, behavior, and associations of the plant, and for this\r\nphysiology is indispensable. It is true that a considerable measure\r\nof success can be obtained by a good teacher in beginning with either\r\nsubject, but the writer believes that measure of success would be\r\ngreater if the subjects were taken up in the order presented here.\r\n\r\nPart II. _Morphology and life history of representative plants._ This\r\nincludes a rather careful study of representative examples among the\r\nalgæ, fungi, liverworts, mosses, ferns and their allies, gymnosperms\r\nand angiosperms, with especial emphasis on the form of plant parts,\r\nand a comparison of them in the different groups, with a comparative\r\nstudy of development, reproduction, and fertilization, rounding out\r\nthe work with a study of life histories and noting progression and\r\nretrogression of certain organs and phases in proceeding from the\r\nlower to the higher plants. Thus, in the algæ a first critical study\r\nis made of four examples which illustrate in a marked way progressive\r\nstages of the plant body, sexual organs, and reproduction. Additional\r\nexamples are then studied for the purpose of acquiring a knowledge of\r\nvariations from these types and to give a broader basis for the brief\r\nconsideration of general relationships and classification.\r\n\r\nA similar plan is followed in the other great groups. The processes of\r\nfertilization and reproduction can be most easily observed in the lower\r\nplants like the algæ and fungi, and this is an additional argument in\r\nfavor of giving emphasis to these forms of plant life as well as the\r\nadvantage of proceeding logically from simpler to more complex forms.\r\nHaving also learned some of these plants in our study of physiology,\r\nwe are following another recognized rule of pedagogy, i.e., proceeding\r\nfrom known objects to unknown structures and processes. Through\r\nthe study of the organs of reproduction of the lower plants and by\r\ngeneral comparative morphology we have come to an understanding of the\r\nmorphology of the parts of the flower, and of the true sexual organs\r\nof the seed plants, and no student can hope to properly interpret the\r\nsignificance of the flower, or the sexual organs of the seed plants who\r\nneglects a careful study of the general morphology of the lower plants.\r\n\r\nPart III. _Plant members in relation to environment._ This part deals\r\nwith the organization of the plant body as a whole in its relation to\r\nenvironment, the organization of plant tissues with a discussion of\r\nthe principal tissues and a descriptive synopsis of the same. This is\r\nfollowed by a complete study from a biological standpoint of the\r\ndifferent members of the plant, their special function and their\r\nspecial relations to environment. The stem, root, leaf, flower, etc.,\r\nare carefully examined and their ecological relations pointed out. This\r\ntogether with the study of physiology and representatives in the groups\r\nof plants forms a thorough basis for pure plant ecology, or the special\r\nstudy of vegetation in its relation to environment.\r\n\r\nThere is a study of the factors of environment or ecological factors,\r\nwhich in general are grouped under the physical, climatic, and biotic\r\nfactors. This is followed by an analysis of vegetation forms and\r\nstructures, plant formations and societies. Then in order are treated\r\nbriefly forest societies, prairie societies, desert societies, arctic\r\nand alpine societies, aquatic societies, and the special societies of\r\nsandy, rocky, and marshy places.\r\n\r\n_Acknowledgments._ The author wishes to express his gratefulness to\r\nall those who have given aid in the preparation of this work, or of\r\nthe earlier editions of Elementary Botany; to his associates, Dr.\r\nE.

For plant growth, as well as some\r\nof the other processes of plant life, are at bottom dependent on this\r\nliving matter. This living matter is called in general _protoplasm_.\r\n\r\n=2.= In most cases protoplasm cannot be seen without the help of\r\na microscope, and it will be necessary for us here to employ one if we\r\nwish to see protoplasm, and to satisfy ourselves by examination that\r\nthe substance we are dealing with _is_ protoplasm.\r\n\r\n=3.= We shall find it convenient first to examine protoplasm\r\nin some of the simpler plants; plants which from their minute size\r\nand simple structure are so transparent that when examined with the\r\nmicroscope the interior can be seen.\r\n\r\nFor our first study let us take a plant known as _spirogyra_, though\r\nthere are a number of others which would serve the purpose quite as\r\nwell, and may quite as easily be obtained for study.\r\n\r\n\r\nProtoplasm in spirogyra.\r\n\r\n=4. The plant spirogyra.=—This plant is found in the water of\r\npools, ditches, ponds, or in streams of slow-running water. It is green\r\nin color, and occurs in loose mats, usually floating near the surface.\r\nThe name “pond-scum” is sometimes given to this plant, along with\r\nothers which are more or less closely related. It is an _alga_, and\r\nbelongs to a group of plants known as _algæ_. If we lift a portion of\r\nit from the water, we see that the mat is made up of a great tangle of\r\ngreen silky threads. Each one of these threads is a plant, so that the\r\nnumber contained in one of these floating mats is very great.\r\n\r\nLet us place a bit of this thread tangle on a glass slip, and examine\r\nwith the microscope and we will see certain things about the plant\r\nwhich are peculiar to it, and which enable us to distinguish it from\r\nother minute green water plants. We shall also wish to learn what these\r\npeculiar parts of the plant are, in order to demonstrate the protoplasm\r\nin the plant.[2]\r\n\r\n=5. Chlorophyll bands in spirogyra.=—We first observe the\r\npresence of bands; green in color, the edges of which are usually\r\nvery irregularly notched. These bands course along in a spiral manner\r\nnear the surface of the thread. There may be one or several of these\r\nspirals, according to the species which we happen to select for\r\nstudy. This green coloring matter of the band is _chlorophyll_, and\r\nthis substance, which also occurs in the higher green plants, will\r\nbe considered in a later chapter. At quite regular intervals in the\r\nchlorophyll band are small starch grains, grouped in a rounded mass\r\nenclosing a minute body, the _pyrenoid_, which is peculiar to many algæ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.\r\n\r\nThread of spirogyra, showing long cells, chlorophyll band, nucleus,\r\nstrands of protoplasm, and the granular wall layer of protoplasm.]\r\n\r\n=6. The spirogyra thread consists of cylindrical cells end to\r\nend.=—Another thing which attracts our attention, as we examine a\r\nthread of spirogyra under the microscope, is that the thread is made up\r\nof cylindrical segments or compartments placed end to end. We can see a\r\ndistinct separating line between the ends. Each one of these segments\r\nor compartments of the thread is a _cell_, and the boundary wall is in\r\nthe form of a cylinder with closed ends.\r\n\r\n=7. Protoplasm.=—Having distinguished these parts of the plant\r\nwe can look for the protoplasm. It occurs within the cells. It is\r\ncolorless (i.e., hyaline) and consequently requires close observation.\r\nNear the center of the cell can be seen a rather dense granular body\r\nof an elliptical or irregular form, with its long diameter transverse\r\nto the axis of the cell in some species; or triangular, or quadrate in\r\nothers. This is the _nucleus_. Around the nucleus is a granular layer\r\nfrom which delicate threads of a shiny granular substance radiate in a\r\nstarlike manner, and terminate in the chlorophyll band at one of the\r\npyrenoids. A granular layer of the same substance lines the inside of\r\nthe cell wall, and can be seen through the microscope if it is properly\r\nfocussed. This granular substance in the cell is _protoplasm_.\r\n\r\n=8. Cell-sap in spirogyra.=—The greater part of the interior\r\nspace of the cell, that between the radiating strands of protoplasm, is\r\noccupied by a watery fluid, the “cell-sap.”\r\n\r\n=9. Reaction of protoplasm to certain reagents.=—We can employ\r\ncertain tests to demonstrate that this granular substance which we have\r\nseen is protoplasm, for it has been found, by repeated experiments with\r\na great many kinds of plants, that protoplasm gives a definite reaction\r\nin response to treatment with certain substances called reagents. Let\r\nus mount a few threads of the spirogyra in a drop of a solution of\r\niodine, and observe the results with the aid of the microscope. The\r\niodine gives a yellowish-brown color to the protoplasm, and it can be\r\nmore distinctly seen. The nucleus is also much more prominent since it\r\ncolors deeply, and we can perceive within the nucleus one small rounded\r\nbody, sometimes more, the _nucleolus_. The iodine here kills and stains\r\nthe protoplasm. The protoplasm, however, in a living condition will\r\nresist for a time some other reagents, as we shall see if we attempt\r\nto stain it with a one per cent aqueous solution of a dye known as\r\n_eosin_. Let us mount a few living threads in such a solution of eosin,\r\nand after a time wash off the stain. The protoplasm remains uncolored.\r\nNow let us place these threads for a short time, two or three minutes,\r\nin strong alcohol, which kills the protoplasm. Then mount them in\r\nthe eosin solution. The protoplasm now takes the eosin stain. After\r\nthe protoplasm has been killed we note that the nucleus is no longer\r\nelliptical or angular in outline, but is rounded. The strands of\r\nprotoplasm are no longer in tension as they were when alive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2. Cell of spirogyra before treatment with iodine.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3. Cell of spirogyra after treatment with alcohol\r\nand iodine.]\r\n\r\n=10.= Let us now take some fresh living threads and mount them in\r\nwater. Place a small drop of dilute glycerine on the slip at one side\r\nof the cover glass, and with a bit of filter paper at the other side\r\ndraw out the water. The glycerine will flow under the cover glass and\r\ncome in contact with the spirogyra threads. Glycerine absorbs water\r\npromptly. Being in contact with the threads it draws water out of the\r\ncell cavity, thus causing the layer of protoplasm which lines the\r\ninside of the cell wall to collapse, and separate from the wall,\r\ndrawing the chlorophyll band inward toward the center also. The wall\r\nlayer of protoplasm can now be more distinctly seen and its granular\r\ncharacter observed.\r\n\r\nWe have thus employed three tests to demonstrate that this substance\r\nwith which we are dealing shows the reactions which we know by\r\nexperience to be given by protoplasm. We therefore conclude that this\r\ncolorless and partly granular, slimy substance in the spirogyra cell\r\nis protoplasm, and that when we have performed these experiments, and\r\nnoted carefully the results, we have _seen_ protoplasm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4. Cell of spirogyra before treatment with\r\nglycerine.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5. Cells of spirogyra after treatment with\r\nglycerine.]\r\n\r\n      =11. Earlier use of the term protoplasm.=—Early\r\n    students of the living matter in the cell considered it\r\n    to be alike in substance, but differing in density; so\r\n    the term protoplasm was applied to all of this living\r\n    matter. The nucleus was looked upon as simply a denser\r\n    portion of the protoplasm, and the nucleolus as a still\r\n    denser portion. Now it is believed that the nucleus\r\n    is a distinct substance, and a permanent organ of the\r\n    cell. The remaining portion of the protoplasm is now\r\n    usually spoken of as the _cytoplasm_.\r\n\r\n      In spirogyra then the cytoplasm in each cell consists\r\n    of a layer which lines the inside of the cell wall,\r\n    a nuclear layer, which surrounds the nucleus, and\r\n    radiating strands which connect the nucleus and wall\r\n    layers, thus suspending the nucleus near the center of\r\n    the cell. But it seems best in this elementary study to\r\n    use the term protoplasm in its general sense.\r\n\r\n\r\nProtoplasm in mucor.\r\n\r\n=12.= Let us now examine in a similar way another of the simple\r\nplants with the special object in view of demonstrating the protoplasm.\r\nFor this purpose we may take one of the plants belonging to the group\r\nof _fungi_. These plants possess no chlorophyll. One of several species\r\nof _mucor_, a common mould, is readily obtainable, and very suitable\r\nfor this study.[3]\r\n\r\n=13. Mycelium of mucor.=—A few days after sowing in some\r\ngelatinous culture medium we find slender, hyaline threads, which are\r\nvery much branched, and, radiating from a central point, form circular\r\ncolonies, if the plant has not been too thickly sown, as shown in\r\nfig. 6. These threads of the fungus form the _mycelium_. From these\r\ncharacters of the plant, which we can readily see without the aid of a\r\nmicroscope, we note how different it is from spirogyra.\r\n\r\nTo examine for protoplasm let us lift carefully a thin block of\r\ngelatine containing the mucor threads, and mount it in water on a\r\nglass slip. Under the microscope we see only a small portion of the\r\nbranched threads. In addition to the absence of chlorophyll, which we\r\nhave already noted, we see that the mycelium is not divided at short\r\nintervals into cells, but appears like a delicate tube with branches,\r\nwhich become successively smaller toward the ends.\r\n\r\n=14. Appearance of the protoplasm.=—Within the tube-like thread\r\nnow note the protoplasm. It has the same general appearance as that\r\nwhich we noted in spirogyra. It is slimy, or semi-fluid, partly\r\nhyaline, and partly granular, the granules consisting of minute\r\nparticles (the _microsomes_). While in mucor the protoplasm has the\r\nsame general appearance as in spirogyra, its arrangement is very\r\ndifferent. In the first place it is plainly continuous throughout the\r\ntube. We do not see the prominent radiations of strands around a large\r\nnucleus, but still the protoplasm does not fill the interior of the\r\nthreads. Here and there are rounded clear spaces termed _vacuoles_,\r\nwhich are filled with the watery fluid, cell-sap. The nuclei in mucor\r\nare very minute, and cannot be seen except after careful treatment with\r\nspecial reagents.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6. Colonies of mucor.]\r\n\r\n=15. Movement of the protoplasm in mucor.=—While examining the\r\nprotoplasm in mucor we are likely to note streaming movements. Often a\r\ncurrent is seen flowing slowly down one side of the thread, and another\r\nflowing back on the other side, or it may all stream along in the same\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n=16. Test for protoplasm.=—Now let us treat the threads with\r\na solution of iodine. The yellowish-brown color appears which is\r\ncharacteristic of protoplasm when subject to this reagent. If we\r\nattempt to stain the living protoplasm with a one per cent aqueous\r\nsolution of eosin it resists it for a time, but if we first kill the\r\nprotoplasm with strong alcohol, it reacts quickly to the application of\r\nthe eosin. If we treat the living threads with glycerine the protoplasm\r\nis contracted away from the wall, as we found to be the case with\r\nspirogyra. While the color, form and structure of the plant mucor is\r\ndifferent from spirogyra, and the arrangement of the protoplasm within\r\nthe plant is also quite different, the reactions when treated by\r\ncertain reagents are the same. We are justified then in concluding that\r\nthe two plants possess in common a substance which we call protoplasm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7. Thread of mucor, showing protoplasm and\r\nvacuoles.]\r\n\r\n\r\nProtoplasm in nitella.\r\n\r\n=17.= One of the most interesting plants for the study of one\r\nremarkable peculiarity of protoplasm is _Nitella_. This plant belongs\r\nto a small group known as stoneworts. They possess chlorophyll, and,\r\nwhile they are still quite simple as compared with the higher plants,\r\nthey are much higher in the scale than spirogyra or mucor.\r\n\r\n=18. Form of nitella.=—A common species of nitella is _Nitella\r\nflexilis_. It grows in quiet pools of water. The plant consists of a\r\nmain axis, in the form of a cylinder. At quite regular intervals are\r\nwhorls of several smaller thread-like outgrowths, which, because of\r\ntheir position, are termed “leaves,” though they are not true leaves.\r\nThese are branched in a characteristic fashion at the tip. The main\r\naxis also branches, these branches arising in the axil of a whorl,\r\nusually singly. The portions of the axis where the whorls arise are the\r\n_nodes_. Each node is made up of a number of small cells definitely\r\narranged. The portion of the axis between two adjacent whorls is an\r\ninternode. These internodes are peculiar. They consist of but a single\r\n“cell,” and are cylindrical, with closed ends. They are sometimes 5-10\r\ncm. long.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8. Portion of plant nitella.]\r\n\r\n=19. Internode of nitella.=—For the study of an internode of\r\nnitella, a small one, near the end, or the ends of one of the “leaves”\r\nis best suited, since it is more transparent. A small portion of the\r\nplant should be placed on the glass slip in water with the cover glass\r\nover a tuft of the branches near the growing end. Examined with the\r\nmicroscope the green chlorophyll bodies, which form oval or oblong\r\ndiscs, are seen to be very numerous. They lie quite closely side by\r\nside and form in perfect rows along the inner surface of the wall.\r\nOne peculiar feature of the arrangement of the chlorophyll bodies is\r\nthat there are two lines, extending from one end of the internode to\r\nthe other on opposite sides, where the chlorophyll bodies are wanting.\r\nThese are known as neutral lines. They run parallel with the axis of\r\nthe internode, or in a more or less spiral manner as shown in fig. 9.\r\n\r\n=20. Cyclosis in nitella.=—The chlorophyll bodies are stationary\r\non the inner surface of the wall, but if the microscope be properly\r\nfocussed just beneath this layer we notice a rotary motion of particles\r\nin the protoplasm. There are small granules and quite large masses of\r\ngranular matter which glide slowly along in one direction on a given\r\nside of the neutral line. If now we examine the protoplasm on the other\r\nside of the neutral line, we see that the movement is in the opposite\r\ndirection. If we examine this movement at the end of an internode\r\nthe particles are seen to glide around the end from one side of the\r\nneutral line to the other. So that when conditions are favorable, such\r\nas temperature, healthy state of the plant, etc., this gliding of the\r\nparticles or apparent streaming of the protoplasm down one side of\r\nthe “cell,” and back upon the other, continues in an uninterrupted\r\nrotation, or _cyclosis_. There are many nuclei in an internode of\r\nnitella, and they move also.\r\n\r\n=21. Test for protoplasm.=—If we treat the plant with a solution\r\nof iodine we get the same reaction as in the case of spirogyra and\r\nmucor. The protoplasm becomes yellowish-brown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9. Cyclosis in nitella.]\r\n\r\n=22. Protoplasm in one of the higher plants.=—We now wish to\r\nexamine, and test for, protoplasm in one of the higher plants. Young\r\nor growing parts of any one of various plants—the petioles of young\r\nleaves, or young stems of growing plants—are suitable for study.\r\nTissue from the pith of corn (Zea mays) in young shoots just back of\r\nthe growing point or quite near the joints of older but growing corn\r\nstalks furnishes excellent material.\r\n\r\nIf we should place part of the stem of this plant under the microscope\r\nwe should find it too opaque for observation of the interior of the\r\ncells. This is one striking difference which we note as we pass from\r\nthe low and simple plants to the higher and more complex ones; not\r\nonly in general is there an increase of size, but also in general an\r\nincrease in thickness of the parts. The cells, instead of lying end to\r\nend or side by side, are massed together so that the parts are quite\r\nopaque. In order to study the interior of the plant we have selected\r\nit must be cut into such thin layers that the light will pass readily\r\nthrough them.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose we section the tissue selected by making with a razor,\r\nor other very sharp knife, very thin slices of it. These are mounted in\r\nwater in the usual way for microscopic study. In this section we notice\r\nthat the cells are polygonal in form. This is brought about by mutual\r\npressure of all the cells. The granular protoplasm is seen to form a\r\nlayer just inside the wall, which is connected with the nuclear layer\r\nby radiating strands of the same substance. The nucleus does not always\r\nlie at the middle of the cell, but often is near one side. If we now\r\napply an alcohol solution of iodine the characteristic yellowish-brown\r\ncolor appears. So we conclude here also that this substance is\r\nidentical with the living matter in the other very different plants\r\nwhich we have studied.\r\n\r\n=23. Movement of protoplasm in the higher plants.=—Certain\r\nparts of the higher plants are suitable objects for the study of the\r\nso-called streaming movement of protoplasm, especially the delicate\r\nhairs, or thread-like outgrowths, such as the silk of corn, or the\r\ndelicate staminal hairs of some plants, like those of the common\r\nspiderwort, tradescantia, or of the tradescantias grown for ornament in\r\ngreenhouses and plant conservatories.\r\n\r\nSometimes even in the living cells of the corn plant which we have just\r\nstudied, slow streaming or gliding movements of the granules are seen\r\nalong the strands of protoplasm where they radiate from the nucleus.\r\nSee note at close of this chapter.\r\n\r\n=24. Movement of protoplasm in cells of the staminal hair of\r\n“spiderwort.”=—A cell of one of these hairs from a stamen of a\r\ntradescantia grown in glass houses is shown in fig. 10. The nucleus is\r\nquite prominent, and its location in the cell varies considerably in\r\ndifferent cells and at different times. There is a layer of protoplasm\r\nall around the nucleus, and from this the strands of protoplasm extend\r\noutward to the wall layer. The large spaces between the strands are, as\r\nwe have found in other cases, filled with the cell-sap.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10. Cell from stamen hair of tradescantia showing\r\nmovement of the protoplasm.]\r\n\r\n      An entire stamen, or a portion of the stamen, having\r\n    several hairs attached, should be carefully mounted\r\n    in water. Care should be taken that the room be not\r\n    cold, and if the weather is cold the water in which\r\n    the preparation is mounted should be warm. With these\r\n    precautions there should be little difficulty in\r\n    observing the streaming movement.\r\n\r\nThe movement is detected by observing the gliding of the granules.\r\nThese move down one of the strands from the nucleus along the wall\r\nlayer, and in towards the nucleus in another strand. After a little the\r\ndirection of the movement in any one portion may be reversed.\r\n\r\n=25. Cold retards the movement.=—While the protoplasm is moving,\r\nif we rest the glass slip on a block of ice, the movement will become\r\nslower, or will cease altogether. Then if we warm the slip gently, the\r\nmovement becomes normal again. We may now apply here the usual tests\r\nfor protoplasm. The result is the same as in the former cases.\r\n\r\n=26. Protoplasm occurs in the living parts of all plants.=—In\r\nthese plants representing such widely different groups, we find a\r\nsubstance which is essentially alike in all. Though its arrangement\r\nin the cell or plant body may differ in the different plants or in\r\ndifferent parts of the same plant, its general appearance is the same.\r\nThough in the different plants it presents, while alive, varying\r\nphenomena, as regards mobility, yet when killed and subjected to\r\nwell known reagents the reaction is in general identical. Knowing\r\nby the experience of various investigators that protoplasm exhibits\r\nthese reactions under given conditions, we have demonstrated to\r\nour satisfaction that we have seen protoplasm in the simple alga,\r\nspirogyra, in the common mould, mucor, in the more complex stonewort,\r\nnitella, and in the cells of tissues of the highest plants.\r\n\r\n=27.= By this simple process of induction of these facts\r\nconcerning this substance in these different plants, we have learned an\r\nimportant method in science study. Though these facts and deductions\r\nare well known, the repetition of the methods by which they are\r\nobtained on the part of each student helps to form habits of scientific\r\ncarefulness and patience, and trains the mind to logical processes in\r\nthe search for knowledge.\r\n\r\n=28.= While we have by no means exhausted the study of protoplasm,\r\nwe can, from this study, draw certain conclusions as to its occurrence\r\nand appearance in plants. Protoplasm is found in the living and growing\r\nparts of all plants. It is a semi-fluid, or slimy, granular, substance;\r\nin some plants, or parts of plants, the protoplasm exhibits a streaming\r\nor gliding movement of the granules. It is irritable. In the living\r\ncondition it resists more or less for some time the absorption of\r\ncertain coloring substances. The water may be withdrawn by glycerine.\r\nThe protoplasm may be killed by alcohol. When treated with iodine it\r\nbecomes a yellowish-brown color.\r\n\r\n      _Note._ In some plants, like elodea for example, it\r\n    has been found that the streaming of the protoplasm is\r\n    often induced by some injury or stimulus, while in the\r\n    normal condition the protoplasm does not move.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] For apparatus, reagents, collection and preservation of material,\r\netc., see Appendix.\r\n\r\n[2] If spirogyra is forming fruit some of the threads will be lying\r\nparallel in pairs, and connected with short tubes. In some of the cells\r\nthere will be found rounded or oval bodies known as _zygospores_. These\r\nmay be seen in fig. 86, and will be described in another part of the\r\nbook.\r\n\r\n[3] The most suitable preparations of mucor for study are made by\r\ngrowing the plant in a nutrient substance which largely consists of\r\ngelatine, or, better, agar-agar, a gelatinous preparation of certain\r\nseaweeds. This, after the plant is sown in it, should be poured into\r\nsterilised shallow glass plates, called Petrie dishes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nABSORPTION, DIFFUSION, OSMOSE.\r\n\r\n\r\n=29.= We may next endeavor to learn how plants absorb water or\r\nnutrient substances in solution. There are several very instructive\r\nexperiments, which can be easily performed, and here again some of the\r\nlower plants will be found useful.\r\n\r\n=30. Osmose in spirogyra.=—Let us mount a few threads of this\r\nplant in water for microscopic examination, and then draw under the\r\ncover glass a five per cent solution of ordinary table salt (NaCl)\r\nwith the aid of filter paper. We shall soon see that the result is\r\nsimilar to that which was obtained when glycerine was used to extract\r\nthe water from the cell-sap, and to contract the protoplasmic membrane\r\nfrom the cell wall. But the process goes on evenly and the plant is not\r\ninjured. The protoplasmic layer contracts slowly from the cell wall,\r\nand the movement of the membrane can be watched by looking through the\r\nmicroscope. The membrane contracts in such a way that all the contents\r\nof the cell are finally collected into a rounded or oval mass which\r\noccupies the center of the cell.\r\n\r\nIf we now add fresh water and draw off the salt solution, we can see\r\nthe protoplasmic membrane expand again, or move out in all directions,\r\nand occupy its former position against the inner surface of the cell\r\nwall. This would indicate that there is some pressure from within while\r\nthis process of absorption is going on, which causes the membrane to\r\nmove out against the cell wall.\r\n\r\nThe salt solution draws water from the cell-sap. There is thus a\r\ntendency to form a vacuum in the cell, and the pressure on the outside\r\nof the protoplasmic membrane causes it to move toward the center of the\r\ncell. When the salt solution is removed and the thread of spirogyra is\r\nagain bathed with water, the movement of the water is _inward_ in the\r\ncell. This would suggest that there is some substance dissolved in the\r\ncell-sap which does not readily filter out through the membrane, but\r\ndraws on the water outside. It is this which produces the pressure from\r\nwithin and crowds the membrane out against the cell wall again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11. Spirogyra before placing in salt solution.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12. Spirogyra in 5% salt solution.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13. Spirogyra from salt solution into water.]\r\n\r\n=31. Turgescence.=—Were it not for the resistance which the cell\r\nwall offers to the pressure from within, the delicate protoplasmic\r\nmembrane would stretch to such an extent that it would be ruptured, and\r\nthe protoplasm therefore would be killed. If we examine the cells at\r\nthe ends of the threads of spirogyra we shall see in most cases that\r\nthe cell wall at the free end is arched outward. This is brought about\r\nby the pressure from within upon the protoplasmic membrane which itself\r\npresses against the cell wall, and causes it to arch outward. This is\r\nbeautifully shown in the case of threads which are recently broken.\r\nThe cell wall is therefore _elastic_; it yields to a certain extent to\r\nthe pressure from within, but a point is soon reached beyond which it\r\nwill not stretch, and an equilibrium then exists between the pressure\r\nfrom within on the protoplasmic membrane, and the pressure from without\r\nby the elastic cell wall. This state of equilibrium in a cell is\r\n_turgescence_, or such a cell is said to be _turgescent_, or _turgid_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14. Before treatment with salt solution.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15. After treatment with salt solution.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16. From salt solution placed in water.\r\n\r\nFigs. 14-16.—Osmosis in threads of mucor.]\r\n\r\n=32. Experiment with beet in salt and sugar solutions.=—We may now\r\ntest the effect of a five per cent salt solution on a portion of the\r\ntissues of a beet or carrot. Let us cut several slices of equal size\r\nand about 5mm in thickness. Immerse a few slices in water, a few in\r\na five per cent salt solution and a few in a strong sugar solution.\r\nIt should be first noted that all the slices are quite rigid when an\r\nattempt is made to bend them between the fingers. In the course of one\r\nor two hours or less, if we examine the slices we shall find that those\r\nin water remain, as at first, quite rigid, while those in the salt and\r\nsugar solutions are more or less flaccid or limp, and readily bend\r\nby pressure between the fingers, the specimens in the salt solution,\r\nperhaps, being more flaccid than those in the sugar solution. The salt\r\nsolution, we judge after our experiment with spirogyra, withdraws some\r\nof the water from the cell-sap, the cells thus losing their turgidity\r\nand the tissues becoming limp or flaccid from the loss of water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17. Before treatment with salt solution.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18. After treatment with salt solution.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19. From salt solution into water again.\r\n\r\nFigs. 17-19.—Osmosis in cells of Indian corn.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20. Rigid condition of fresh beet section.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21. Limp condition after lying in salt solution.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22. Rigid again after lying again in water.\r\n\r\nFigs. 20-22.—Turgor and osmosis in slices of beet.]\r\n\r\n=33.= Let us now remove some of the slices of the beet from the\r\nsugar and salt solutions, wash them with water and then immerse them in\r\nfresh water. In the course of thirty minutes to one hour, if we examine\r\nthem again, we find that they have regained, partly or completely,\r\ntheir rigidity. Here again we infer from the former experiment with\r\nspirogyra that the substances in the cell-sap now draw water inward;\r\nthat is, the diffusion current is inward through the cell walls and the\r\nprotoplasmic membrane, and the tissue becomes turgid again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23. Before treatment with salt solution.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24. After treatment with salt solution.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 25. Later stage of the same.\r\n\r\nFigs. 23-25.—Cells from beet treated with salt solution to show\r\nosmosis and movement of the protoplasmic membrane.]\r\n\r\n=34. Osmose in the cells of the beet.=—We should now make a\r\nsection of the fresh tissue of a red colored beet for examination with\r\nthe microscope, and treat this section with the salt solution. Here we\r\ncan see that the effect of the salt solution is to draw water out of\r\nthe cell, so that the protoplasmic membrane can be seen to move inward\r\nfrom the cell wall just as was observed in the case of spirogyra.[4]\r\nNow treating the section with water and removing the salt solution, the\r\ndiffusion current is in the opposite direction, that is inward through\r\nthe protoplasmic membrane, so that the latter is pressed outward until\r\nit comes in contact with the cell wall again, which by its elasticity\r\nsoon resists the pressure and the cells again become turgid.\r\n\r\n=35. The coloring matter in the cell-sap does not readily escape\r\nfrom the living protoplasm of the beet.=—The red coloring matter,\r\nas seen in the section under the microscope, does not escape from the\r\ncell-sap through the protoplasmic membrane. When the slices are placed\r\nin water, the water is not colored thereby. The same is true when the\r\nslices are placed in the salt or sugar solutions. Although water is\r\nwithdrawn from the cell-sap, this coloring substance does not escape,\r\nor if it does it escapes slowly and after a considerable time.\r\n\r\n=36. The coloring matter escapes from dead protoplasm.=—If,\r\nhowever, we heat the water containing a slice of beet up to a point\r\nwhich is sufficient to kill the protoplasm, the red coloring matter\r\nin the cell-sap filters out through the protoplasmic membrane and\r\ncolors the water. If we heat a preparation made for study under the\r\nmicroscope up to the thermal death point we can see here that the red\r\ncoloring matter escapes through the membrane into the water outside.\r\nThis teaches that certain substances cannot readily filter through\r\nthe living membrane of protoplasm, but that they can filter through\r\nwhen the protoplasm is dead. A very important condition, then, for\r\nthe successful operation of some of the physical processes connected\r\nwith absorption in plants is that the protoplasm should be in a living\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n=37. Osmose experiments with leaves.=—We may next take the leaves\r\nof certain plants like the geranium, coleus or other plant, and place\r\nthem in shallow vessels containing water, salt, and sugar solutions\r\nrespectively. The leaves should be immersed, but the petioles should\r\nproject out of the water or solutions. Seedlings of corn or beans,\r\nespecially the latter, may also be placed in these solutions, so that\r\nthe leafy ends are immersed. After one or two hours an examination\r\nshows that the specimens in the water are still turgid. But if we lift\r\na leaf or a bean plant from the salt or sugar solution, we find that\r\nit is flaccid and limp. The blade, or lamina, of the leaf droops as if\r\nwilted, though it is still wet. The bean seedling also is flaccid, the\r\nsucculent stem bending nearly double as the lower part of the stem is\r\nheld upright. This loss of turgidity is brought about by the loss of\r\nwater from the tissues, and judging from the experiments on spirogyra\r\nand the beet, we conclude that the loss of turgidity is caused by the\r\nwithdrawal of some of the water from the cell-sap by the strong salt\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\n=38.= Now if we wash carefully these leaves and seedlings, which\r\nhave been in the salt and sugar solutions, with water, and then immerse\r\nthem in fresh water for a few hours, they will regain their turgidity.\r\nHere again we are led to infer that the diffusion current is now inward\r\nthrough the protoplasmic membranes of all the living cells of the leaf,\r\nand that the resulting turgidity of the individual cells causes the\r\nturgidity of the leaf or stem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 26. Seedling of radish, showing root hairs.]\r\n\r\n=39. Absorption by root hairs.=—If we examine seedlings, which\r\nhave been grown in a germinator or in the folds of paper or cloths so\r\nthat the roots will be free from particles of soil, we see near the\r\ngrowing point of the roots that the surface is covered with numerous\r\nslender, delicate, thread-like bodies, the root hairs. Let us place a\r\nportion of a small root containing some of these root hairs in water on\r\na glass slip, and prepare it for examination with the microscope. We\r\nsee that each thread, or root hair, is a continuous tube, or in other\r\nwords it is a single cell which has become very much elongated. The\r\nprotoplasmic membrane lines the wall, and strands of protoplasm extend\r\nacross at irregular intervals, the interspaces being occupied by the\r\ncell-sap.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 27. Root hair of corn before and after treatment\r\nwith 5% salt solution.]\r\n\r\nWe should now draw under the cover glass some of the five per cent salt\r\nsolution. The protoplasmic membrane moves away from the cell wall at\r\ncertain points, showing that _plasmolysis_ is taking place, that is,\r\nthe diffusion current is outward so that the cell-sap loses some of its\r\nwater, and the pressure from the outside moves the membrane inward.\r\nWe should not allow the salt solution to work on the root hairs long.\r\nIt should be very soon removed by drawing in fresh water before the\r\nprotoplasmic membrane has been broken at intervals, as is apt to be the\r\ncase by the strong diffusion current and the consequent strong pressure\r\nfrom without. The membrane of protoplasm now moves outward as the\r\ndiffusion current is inward, and soon regains its former position next\r\nthe inner side of the cell wall. The root hairs then, like other parts\r\nof the plant which we have investigated, have the power of taking up\r\nwater under pressure.\r\n\r\n=40. Cell-sap a solution of certain substances.=—From these\r\nexperiments we are led to believe that certain substances reside in the\r\ncell-sap of plants, which behave very much like the salt solution when\r\nseparated from water by the protoplasmic membrane. Let us attempt to\r\ninterpret these phenomena by recourse to diffusion experiments, where\r\nan animal membrane separates two liquids of different concentration.\r\n\r\n=41. An artificial cell to illustrate turgor.=—Fill a small\r\nwide-mouthed vial with a _very strong_ sugar solution. Over the mouth\r\ntie firmly a piece of _bladder_ membrane. Be certain that as the\r\nmembrane is tied over the open end of the vial, the sugar solution\r\nfills it in order to keep out air bubbles. Sink the vial in a vessel of\r\nfresh water and leave it there for twenty-four hours. Remove the vial\r\nand note that the membrane is arched outward. Thrust a sharp needle\r\nthrough the membrane when it is arched outward, and quickly pull it\r\nout. The liquid spurts out because of the inside pressure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28. Puncturing a make-believe cell after\r\nit has been lying in water.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29. Same as Fig. 28 after needle is removed.]\r\n\r\n=42. Diffusion through an animal membrane.=—For this experiment\r\nwe may use a thistle tube, across the larger end of which should be\r\nstretched and tied tightly a piece of a bladder membrane. A strong\r\nsugar solution (three parts sugar to one part water) is now placed in\r\nthe tube so that the bulb is filled and the liquid extends part way in\r\nthe neck of the tube. This is immersed in water within a wide-mouth\r\nbottle, the neck of the tube being supported in a perforated cork in\r\nsuch a way that the sugar solution in the tube is on a level with the\r\nwater in the bottle or jar. In a short while the liquid begins to\r\nrise in the thistle tube, in the course of several hours having risen\r\nseveral centimeters. The diffusion current is thus stronger through the\r\nmembrane in the direction of the sugar solution, so that this gains\r\nmore water than it loses.\r\n\r\nWe have here two liquids separated by an animal membrane, water on\r\nthe one hand which diffuses readily through the membrane, while on\r\nthe other is a solution of sugar which diffuses through the animal\r\nmembrane with difficulty. The water, therefore, not containing any\r\nsolvent, according to a general law which has been found to obtain in\r\nsuch cases, diffuses more readily through the membrane into the sugar\r\nsolution, which thus increases in volume, and also becomes more dilute.\r\nThe bladder membrane is what is sometimes called a diffusion membrane,\r\nsince the diffusion currents travel through it.\r\n\r\n=43.= In this experiment then the bulk of the sugar solution is\r\nincreased, and the liquid rises in the tube by this pressure above\r\nthe level of the water in the jar outside of the thistle tube. The\r\ndiffusion of liquids through a membrane is _osmosis_.\r\n\r\n=44. Importance of these physical processes in plants.=—Now if\r\nwe recur to our experiment with spirogyra we find that exactly the\r\nsame processes take place. The protoplasmic membrane is the diffusion\r\nmembrane, through which the diffusion takes place. The salt solution\r\nwhich is first used to bathe the threads of the plant is a stronger\r\nsolution than that of the cell-sap within the cell. Water therefore\r\nis drawn out of the cell-sap, but the substances in solution in\r\nthe cell-sap do not readily move out. As the bulk of the cell-sap\r\ndiminishes the pressure from the outside pushes the protoplasmic\r\nmembrane away from the wall. Now when we remove the salt solution and\r\nbathe the thread with water again, the cell-sap, being a solution of\r\ncertain substances, diffuses with more difficulty than the water, and\r\nthe diffusion current is inward, while the protoplasmic membrane moves\r\nout against the cell wall, and turgidity again results. Also in the\r\nexperiments with salt and sugar solutions on the leaves of geranium,\r\non the leaves and stems of the seedlings, on the tissues and cells of\r\nthe beet and carrot, and on the root hairs of the seedlings, the same\r\nprocesses take place.\r\n\r\nThese experiments not only teach us that in the protoplasmic membrane,\r\nthe cell wall, and the cell-sap of plants do we have structures which\r\nare capable of performing these physical processes, but they also show\r\nthat these processes are of the utmost importance to the plant; not\r\nonly in giving the plant the power to take up solutions of nutriment\r\nfrom the soil, but they serve also other purposes, as we shall see\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[4] We should note that the coloring matter of the beet resides in\r\nthe cell-sap. It is in these colored cells that we can best see the\r\nmovement take place, since the red color serves to differentiate well\r\nthe moving mass from the cell wall. The protoplasmic membrane at\r\nseveral points usually clings tenaciously so that at several places the\r\nmembrane is arched strongly away from the cell wall as shown in fig.\r\n24. While water is removed from the cell-sap, we note that the coloring\r\nmatter does not escape through the protoplasmic membrane.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nHOW PLANTS OBTAIN WATER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn connection with the study of the means of absorption from the soil\r\nor water by plants, it will be found convenient to observe carefully\r\nthe various forms of the plant. Without going into detail here, the\r\nsuggestion is made that simple thread forms like spirogyra, œdogonium,\r\nand vaucheria; expanded masses of cells as are found in the thalloid\r\nliverworts, the duckweed, etc., be compared with those liverworts, and\r\nwith the mosses, where leaf-like expansions of a central axis have been\r\ndifferentiated. We should then note how this differentiation, from the\r\nphysiological standpoint, has been carried farther in the higher land\r\nplants.\r\n\r\n=45. Absorption by Algæ and Fungi.=—In the simpler forms of\r\nplant life, as in spirogyra and many of the algæ and fungi, the plant\r\nbody is not differentiated into parts.[5] In many other cases the only\r\ndifferentiation is between the growing part and the fruiting part. In\r\nthe algæ and fungi there is no differentiation into stem and leaf,\r\nthough there is an approach to it in some of the higher forms. Where\r\nthis simple plant body is flattened, as in the sea-wrack, or ulva, it\r\nis a _frond_. The Latin word for frond is _thallus_, and this name is\r\napplied to the plant body of all the lower plants, the algæ and fungi.\r\nThe algæ and fungi together are sometimes called the _thallophytes_,\r\nor _thallus plants_. The word thallus is also sometimes applied to the\r\nflattened body of the liverworts. In the foliose liverworts and mosses\r\nthere is an axis with leaf-like expansions. These are believed by some\r\nto represent true stems and leaves, by others to represent a flattened\r\nthallus in which the margins are deeply and regularly divided, or in\r\nwhich the expansion has only taken place at regular intervals.\r\n\r\nIn nearly all of the algæ the plant body is submerged in water. In these\r\ncases absorption takes place through all portions of the surface in\r\ncontact with the water, as in spirogyra, vaucheria, and all of the\r\nlarger seaweeds. Comparatively few of the algæ grow on the surfaces\r\nof rocks or trees. In these examples it is likely that at times only\r\nportions of the plant body serve in the process of absorption of water\r\nfrom the substratum. A few of the algæ are parasitic, living in the\r\ntissues of higher plants, where they are surrounded by the water or\r\nliquids within the host. Absorption takes place in the same way in many\r\nof the fungi. The aquatic fungi are immersed in water. In other forms,\r\nlike mucor, a portion of the mycelium is within the substratum, and\r\nbeing bathed by the water or watery solutions absorbs the same, while\r\nthe fruiting portion and the aerial mycelium obtain their water and\r\nfood solutions from the mycelium in the substratum. In higher fungi,\r\nlike the mushrooms, the mycelium within the ground or decaying wood\r\nabsorbs the water necessary for the fruiting portion; while in the case\r\nof the parasitic fungi the mycelium lies in the water or liquid within\r\nthe host.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30. Thallus of Riccia lutescens.]\r\n\r\n=46. Absorption by liverworts.=—In many of the plants termed\r\nliverworts the vegetative part of the plant is a thin, flattened, more\r\nor less elongated green body known as a thallus.\r\n\r\n_Riccia._—One of these, belonging to the genus riccia, is shown in\r\nfig. 30. Its shape is somewhat like that of a minute ribbon which is\r\nforked at intervals in a dichotomous manner, the characteristic kind of\r\nbranching found in these thalloid liverworts. This riccia (known as R.\r\nlutescens) occurs on damp soil; long, slender, hair-like processes grow\r\nout from the under surface of the thallus which resemble root hairs and\r\nserve the same purpose in the processes of absorption. Another species\r\nof riccia (R. crystallina) is shown in fig. 252. This plant is quite\r\ncircular in outline and occurs on muddy flats. Some species float on\r\nthe water.\r\n\r\n=47. Marchantia.=—One of the larger and coarser liverworts is figured\r\nat 31. This is a very common liverwort, growing in very damp and muddy\r\nplaces and also along the margins of streams, on the mud or upon\r\nthe surfaces of rocks which are bathed with the water. This is known\r\nas _Marchantia polymorpha_. If we examine the under surface of the\r\nmarchantia we see numerous hair-like processes which attach the plant\r\nto the soil. Under the microscope we see that some of these are similar\r\nto the root hairs of the seedlings which we have been studying, and\r\nthey serve the purpose of absorption. Since, however, there are no\r\nroots on the marchantia plant, these hair-like outgrowths are usually\r\ntermed here _rhizoids_. In marchantia they are of two kinds, one kind\r\nthe simple ones with smooth walls, and the other kind in which the\r\ninner surfaces of the walls are roughened by processes which extend\r\ninward in the form of irregular tooth-like points. Besides the hairs on\r\nthe under side of the thallus we note especially near the growing end\r\nthat there are two rows of leaf-like scales, those at the end of the\r\nthallus curving up over the growing end, thus serving to protect the\r\ndelicate tissues at the growing point.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 31. Marchantia plant with cupules and gemmæ;\r\nrhizoids below.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 32. Portion of plant of Frullania, a foliose\r\nliverwort.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 33. Portion of same more highly magnified, showing\r\noverlapping leaves.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 34. Under side, showing forked under row of leaves\r\nand lobes of lateral leaves.]\r\n\r\n=48. Frullania.=—In fig. 32 is shown another liverwort, which\r\ndiffers greatly in form from the ones we have just been studying in\r\nthat there is a well-defined axis with lateral leaf-like outgrowths.\r\nSuch liverworts are called foliose liverworts. Besides these two quite\r\nprominent rows of leaves there is a third row of poorly developed\r\nleaves on the under surface. Also from the under surface of the axis we\r\nsee here and there slender outgrowths, the rhizoids, through which much\r\nof the water is absorbed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 35. Foliose liverwort (bazzania) showing\r\ndichotomous branching and overlapping leaves.]\r\n\r\n=49. Absorption by the mosses.=—Among the mosses, which are\r\nusually common in moist and shaded situations, examples are abundant\r\nwhich are suitable for the study of the organs of absorption. If we\r\ntake for example a plant of mnium (M. affine), which is illustrated in\r\nfig. 36, we note that it consists of a slender axis with thin flat,\r\ngreen, leaf-like expansions, Examining with the microscope the lower\r\nend of the axis, which is attached to the substratum, there are seen\r\nnumerous brown-colored threads more or less branched.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 36. Female plant (gametophyte) of a moss (mnium),\r\nshowing rhizoids below, and the tuft of leaves above, which protect the\r\narchegonia.]\r\n\r\n=50. Absorption by the higher aquatic plants.=—Examples of\r\nthe water plants which are entirely submerged in water are the\r\nwater-crowfoots, some of the pondweeds, elodea or water-weeds, the\r\ntape-grass, vallisneria, etc. In these plants all parts of the body\r\nbeing submerged, they absorb water with which they are in contact. In\r\nother aquatic plants, like the water-lilies, some of the pondweeds, the\r\nduck-meats, etc., are only partially submerged in the water; the upper\r\nsurface of the leaf or of the leaf-like expansion being exposed to the\r\nair, while the under surface lies in close contact with the water, and\r\nthe stems and the petioles of the leaves are also immersed in water. In\r\nthese plants absorption takes place through those parts in contact with\r\nthe water.\r\n\r\n=51. Absorption by the duck-meats.=—These plants are very curious\r\nexamples of the higher plants.\r\n\r\n      _Lemna._—One of these is illustrated in fig. 37.\r\n    This is the common duckweed, _Lemna trisulca_. It\r\n    is very peculiar in form and in its mode of growth.\r\n    Each one of the lateral leaf-like expansions extends\r\n    outwards by the elongation of the basal part, which\r\n    becomes long and slender. Next, two new lateral\r\n    expansions are formed on these by prolification from\r\n    near the base, and thus the plant continues to extend.\r\n    The plant occurs in ponds and ditches and is sometimes\r\n    very common and abundant. It floats on the surface\r\n    of the water. While the flattened part of the plant\r\n    resembles a leaf, it is really the stem, no leaves\r\n    being present. This expanded green body is usually\r\n    termed a “frond.” A single rootlet grows out from the\r\n    under side and is destitute of root hairs. Absorption\r\n    of water therefore takes place through this rootlet and\r\n    through the under side of the “frond.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 37. Fronds of the duckweed (Lemna trisculca).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 38. Spirodela polyrhiza.]\r\n\r\n=52. Spirodela polyrhiza.=—This is a very curious plant, closely\r\nrelated to the lemna and sometimes placed in the same genus. It occurs\r\nin similar situations, and is very readily grown in aquaria. It reminds\r\none of a little insect as seen in fig. 38. There are several rootlets\r\non the under side of the frond. Absorption of water takes place here in\r\nthe same way as in lemna.\r\n\r\n=53. Absorption in wolffia.=—Perhaps the most curious of these\r\nmodified water plants is the little wolffia, which contains the\r\nsmallest specimens of the flowering plants. Two species of this genus\r\nare shown in figs. 39-41. The plant body is reduced to nothing but a\r\nrounded or oval green body, which represents the stem. No leaves or\r\nroots are present. The plants multiply by “prolification,” the new\r\nfronds growing out from a depression on the under side of one end.\r\nAbsorption takes place through the under surface.\r\n\r\n=54. Absorption by land plants.=—_Water cultures._—In connection\r\nwith our inquiry as to how land plants obtain their water, it will be\r\nconvenient to prepare some water cultures to illustrate this and which\r\ncan also be used later in our study of nutrition (Chapter IX).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 39. Young frond of wolffia growing out of older\r\none.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 40. Young frond of wolffia separating from older\r\none.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 41. Another species of wolffia, the two fronds\r\nstill connected.]\r\n\r\nChemical analysis shows that certain mineral substances are common\r\nconstituents of plants. By growing plants in different solutions of\r\nthese various substances it has been possible to determine what ones\r\nare necessary constituents of plant food. While the proportion of the\r\nmineral elements which enter into the composition of plant food may\r\nvary considerably within certain limits, the concentration of the\r\nsolutions should not exceed certain limits. A very useful solution is\r\none recommended by Sachs, and is as follows:\r\n\r\n=55. Formula for water cultures=:\r\n\r\n    Water                           1000 cc.\r\n    Potassium nitrate                0.5 gr.\r\n    Sodium chloride                  0.5 “\r\n    Calcium sulphate                 0.5 “\r\n    Magnesium sulphate               0.5 “\r\n    Calcium phosphate                0.5 “\r\n\r\nThe calcium phosphate is only partly soluble. The solution which is not\r\nin use should be kept in a dark cool place to prevent the growth of\r\nminute algæ.\r\n\r\n=56.= Several different plants are useful for experiments in water\r\ncultures, as peas, corn, beans, buckwheat, etc. The seeds of these\r\nplants may be germinated, after soaking them for several hours in warm\r\nwater, by placing them between the folds of wet paper on shallow trays,\r\nor in the folds of wet cloth. The seeds should not be kept immersed in\r\nwater after they have imbibed enough to thoroughly soak and swell them.\r\nAt the same time that the seeds are placed in damp paper or cloth for\r\ngermination, one lot of the soaked seeds should be planted in good soil\r\nand kept under the same temperature conditions, for control. When the\r\nplants have germinated one series should be grown in distilled water,\r\nwhich possesses no plant food; another in the nutrient solution, and\r\nstill another in the nutrient solution to which has been added a few\r\ndrops of a solution of iron chloride or ferrous sulphate. There would\r\nthen be four series of cultures which should be carried out with the\r\nsame kind of seed in each series so that the comparisons can be made on\r\nthe same species under the different conditions. The series should be\r\nnumbered and recorded as follows:\r\n\r\n    No. 1, soil.\r\n    No. 2, distilled water.\r\n    No. 3, nutrient solution.\r\n    No. 4, nutrient solution with a few drops of iron solution added.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 42. Culture cylinder to show position of\r\ncorn seedling (Hansen).]\r\n\r\n=57.= Small jars or wide-mouth bottles, or crockery jars, can be\r\nused for the water cultures, and the cultures are set up as follows: A\r\ncork which will just fit in the mouth of the bottle, or which can be\r\nsupported by pins, is perforated so that there is room to insert the\r\nseedling, with the root projecting below into the liquid. The seed can\r\nbe fastened in position by inserting a pin through one side, if it is a\r\nlarge one, or in the case of small seeds a cloth of a coarse mesh can\r\nbe tied over the mouth of the bottle instead of using the cork. After\r\nproperly setting up the experiments the cultures should be arranged\r\nin a suitable place, and observed from time to time during several\r\nweeks. In order to obtain more satisfactory results several duplicate\r\nseries should be set up to guard against the error which might arise\r\nfrom variation in individual plants and from accident. Where there are\r\nseveral students in a class, a single series set up by several will\r\nact as checks upon one another. If glass jars are used for the liquid\r\ncultures they should be wrapped with black paper or cloth to exclude\r\nthe light from the liquid, otherwise numerous minute algæ are apt to\r\ngrow and interfere with the experiment. Or the jars may be sunk in pots\r\nof earth to serve the same purpose. If crockery jars are used they will\r\nnot need covering.\r\n\r\n=58.= For some time all the plants grow equally well, until the\r\nnutriment stored in the seed is exhausted. The numbers 1, 3 and 4, in\r\nsoil and nutrient solutions, should outstrip number 2, the plants in\r\nthe distilled water. No. 4 in the nutrient solution with iron, having a\r\nperfect food, compares favorably with the plants in the soil.\r\n\r\n=59. Plants take liquid food from the soil.=—From these experiments\r\nthen we judge that such plants take up the food they receive from the\r\nsoil in the form of a liquid, the elements being in solution in water.\r\n\r\nIf we recur now to the experiments which were performed with the salt\r\nsolution in producing plasmolysis in the cells of spirogyra, in the\r\ncells of the beet or corn, and in the root hairs of the corn and bean\r\nseedlings, and the way in which these cells become turgid again when\r\nthe salt solution is removed and they are again bathed with water, we\r\nshall have an explanation of the way in which plants take up nutrient\r\nsolutions of food material through their roots.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 43. Section of corn root, showing rhizoids formed\r\nfrom elongated epidermal cells.]\r\n\r\n=60. How food solutions are carried into the plant.=—We can see\r\nhow water and food solutions are carried into the plant, and we must\r\nnext turn our attention to the way in which these solutions are carried\r\nfarther into the plant. We should make a section across the root of a\r\nseedling in the region of the root hairs and examine it with the aid\r\nof a microscope. We here see that the root hairs are formed by the\r\nelongation of certain of the surface cells of the root. These cells\r\nelongate perpendicularly to the root, and become _3mm_ to _6mm_ long.\r\nThey are flexuous or irregular in outline and cylindrical, as shown in\r\nfig. 43. The end of the hair next the root fits in between the adjacent\r\nsuperficial cells of the root and joins closely to the next deeper\r\nlayer of cells. In studying the section of the young root we see that\r\nthe root is made up of cells which lie closely side by side, each with\r\nits wall, its protoplasm and cell-sap, the protoplasmic membrane lying\r\non the inside of each cell wall.\r\n\r\n=61.= In the absorption of the watery solutions of plant food\r\nby the root hairs, the cell-sap, being a more concentrated solution,\r\ngains some of the former, since the liquid of less concentration flows\r\nthrough the protoplasmic membrane into the more concentrated cell-sap,\r\nincreasing the bulk of the latter. This makes the root hairs turgid,\r\nand at the same time dilutes the cell-sap so that the concentration is\r\nnot so great. The cells of the root lying inside and close to the base\r\nof the root hairs have a cell-sap which is now more concentrated than\r\nthe diluted cell-sap of the hairs, and consequently gain some of the\r\nfood solutions from the latter, which tends to lessen the content of\r\nthe root hairs and also to increase the concentration of the cell-sap\r\nof the same. This makes it possible for the root hairs to draw on\r\nthe soil for more of the food solutions, and thus, by a variation in\r\nthe concentration of the substances in solution in the cell-sap of\r\nthe different cells, the food solutions are carried along until they\r\nreach the _vascular bundles_, through which the solutions are carried\r\nto distant parts of the plant. Some believe that there is a rhythmic\r\naction of the elastic cell walls in these cells between the root hairs\r\nand the vascular bundles. This occurs in such a way that, after the\r\ncell becomes turgid, it contracts, thus reducing the size of the cell\r\nand forcing some of the food solutions into the adjacent cells, when\r\nby absorption of more food solutions, or water, the cell increases in\r\nturgidity again. This rhythmic action of the cells, if it does take\r\nplace, would act as a pump to force the solutions along, and would form\r\none of the causes of root pressure.\r\n\r\n=62. How the root hairs get the watery solutions from the\r\nsoil.=—If we examine the root hairs of a number of seedlings which\r\nare growing in the soil under normal conditions, we shall see that a\r\nlarge quantity of soil readily clings to the roots. We should note also\r\nthat unless the soil has been recently watered there is no free water\r\nin it; the soil is only moist. We are curious to know how plants can\r\nobtain water from soil which is not wet. If we attempt to wash off the\r\nsoil from the roots, being careful not to break away the root hairs,\r\nwe find, that small particles cling so tenaciously to the root hairs\r\nthat they are not removed. Placing a few such root hairs under the\r\nmicroscope it appears as if here and there the root hairs were glued to\r\nthe minute soil particles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 44. Root hairs of corn seedling with soil particles\r\nadhering closely.]\r\n\r\n=63.= If now we take some of the soil which is only moist, weigh\r\nit, and then permit it to become quite dry on exposure to dry air, and\r\nweigh again, we find that it loses weight in drying. Moisture has been\r\ngiven off. This moisture, it has been found, forms an exceedingly thin\r\nfilm on the surface of the minute soil particles. Where these soil\r\nparticles lie closely together, as they usually do when massed together\r\nin the pot or elsewhere, this thin film of moisture is continuous from\r\nthe surface of one particle to that of another. Thus the soil particles\r\nwhich are so closely attached to the root hairs connect the surface\r\nof the root hairs with this film of moisture. As the cell-sap of the\r\nroot hairs draws on the moisture film with which they are in contact,\r\nthe tension of this film is sufficient to draw moisture from distant\r\nparticles. In this way the roots are supplied with water in soil which\r\nis only moist.\r\n\r\n=64. Plants cannot remove all the moisture from the soil.=—If we\r\nnow take a potted plant, or a pot containing a number of seedlings,\r\nplace it in a moderately dry room, and do not add water to the soil we\r\nfind in a few days that the plant is wilting. The soil if examined will\r\nappear quite dry to the sense of touch. Let us weigh some of this soil,\r\nthen dry it by artificial heat, and weigh again. It has lost in weight.\r\nThis has been brought about by driving off the moisture which still\r\nremained in the soil after the plant began to wilt. This teaches that\r\nwhile plants can obtain water from soil which is only moist or which is\r\neven rather dry, they are not able to withdraw all the moisture from\r\nthe soil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 45. Experiment to show root pressure (Detmer).]\r\n\r\n=65. “Root pressure” or exudation pressure.=—It is a very common\r\nthing to note, when certain shrubs or vines are pruned in the spring,\r\nthe exudation of a watery fluid from the cut surfaces. In the case of\r\nthe grape vine this has been known to continue for a number of days,\r\nand in some cases the amount of liquid, called “sap,” which escapes is\r\nconsiderable. In many cases it is directly traceable to the activity\r\nof the roots, or root hairs, in the absorption of water from the soil.\r\nFor this reason the term _root pressure_ has been used to denote the\r\nforce exerted in supplying the water from the soil. But there are some\r\nwho object to the use of this term “root pressure.” The principal\r\nobjection is that the pressure which brings about the phenomenon\r\nknown as “bleeding” by plants is not present in the roots alone. This\r\npressure exists under certain conditions in all parts of the plant. The\r\nterm exudation pressure has been proposed in lieu of root pressure. It\r\nshould be remembered that the movement of water in the plant is started\r\nby the pressure which exists in the root. If the term “root pressure”\r\nis used, it should be borne clearly in mind that it does not express\r\nthe phenomenon exactly in all cases.\r\n\r\n=Root pressure may be measured.=—It is possible to measure\r\nnot only the amount of water which the roots will raise in a given\r\ntime, but also to measure the force exerted by the roots during root\r\npressure. It has been found that root pressure in the case of the\r\nnettle is sufficient to hold a column of water about 4.5 meters (15\r\nft.) high (Vines), while the root pressure of the vine (Hales, 1721)\r\nwill hold a column of water about 10 meters (36.5 ft.) high, and the\r\nbirch (Betula lutea) (Clark, 1873) has a root pressure sufficient to\r\nhold a column of water about 25 meters (84.7 ft.) high.\r\n\r\n=66. Experiment to demonstrate root pressure.=—By a very simple\r\nmethod this lifting of water by root pressure is shown. During the\r\nsummer season plants in the open may be used if it is preferred, but\r\nplants grown in pots are also very serviceable, and one may use a\r\npotted begonia or balsam, the latter being especially useful. The\r\nplants are usually convenient to obtain from the greenhouses, to\r\nillustrate this phenomenon. The stem is cut off rather close to the\r\nsoil and a long glass tube is attached to the cut end of the stem,\r\nstill connected with the roots, by the use of rubber tubing, as shown\r\nin figure 45, and a very small quantity of water may be poured in to\r\nmoisten the cut end of the stem. In a few minutes the water begins to\r\nrise in the glass tube. In some cases it rises quite rapidly, so that\r\nthe column of water can readily be seen to extend higher and higher up\r\nin the tube when observed at quite short intervals. (To measure the\r\nforce of root pressure is rather difficult for elementary work. To\r\nmeasure it see Ganong, Plant Physiology, pp. 67, 68, or some other book\r\nfor advanced work.)\r\n\r\n=67.= In either case where the experiment is continued for\r\nseveral days it is noticed that the column of water or of mercury\r\nrises and falls at different times during the same day, that is, the\r\ncolumn stands at varying heights; or in other words the root pressure\r\nvaries during the day. With some plants it has been found that the\r\npressure is greatest at certain times of the day, or at certain\r\nseasons of the year. Such variation of root pressure exhibits what\r\nis termed a periodicity, and in the case of some plants there is a\r\ndaily periodicity; while in others there is in addition an annual\r\nperiodicity. With the grape vine the root pressure is greatest in\r\nthe forenoon, and decreases from 12-6 P.M., while with the\r\nsunflower it is greatest before 10 A.M., when it begins to\r\ndecrease. Temperature of the soil is one of the most important external\r\nconditions affecting the activity of root pressure.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[5] See Chapter 38 for organization of members of the plant body.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTRANSPIRATION, OR THE LOSS OF WATER BY PLANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=68.= We should now inquire if all the water which is taken up in\r\nexcess of that which actually suffices for turgidity is used in the\r\nelaboration of new materials of construction. We notice when a leaf\r\nor shoot is cut away from a plant, unless it is kept in quite a moist\r\ncondition, or in a damp, cool place, that it becomes flaccid, and\r\ndroops. It wilts, as we say. The leaves and shoot lose their turgidity.\r\nThis fact suggests that there has been a loss of water from the shoot\r\nor leaf. It can be readily seen that this loss is not in the form of\r\ndrops of water which issue from the cut end of the shoot or petiole.\r\nWhat then becomes of the water in the cut leaf or shoot?\r\n\r\n=69. Loss of water from excised leaves.=—Let us take a handful of\r\nfresh, green, rather succulent leaves, which are free from water on\r\nthe surface, and place them under a glass bell jar, which is tightly\r\nclosed below but which contains no water. Now place this in a brightly\r\nlighted window, or in sunlight. In the course of fifteen to thirty\r\nminutes we notice that a thin film of moisture is accumulating on the\r\ninner surface of the glass jar. After an hour or more the moisture has\r\naccumulated so that it appears in the form of small drops of condensed\r\nwater. We should set up at the same time a bell jar in exactly the same\r\nway but which contains no leaves. In this jar there is no condensed\r\nmoisture on the inner surface. We thus are justified in concluding that\r\nthe moisture in the former jar comes from the leaves. Since there is no\r\nvisible water on the surfaces of the leaves, or at the cut ends, before\r\nit may have condensed there, we infer that the water escapes from the\r\nleaves in the form of _water vapor_, and that this water vapor, when\r\nit comes in contact with the surface of the cold glass, condenses and\r\nforms the moisture film, and later the drops of water. The leaves of\r\nthese cut shoots therefore lose water in the form of water vapor, and\r\nthus a loss of turgidity results.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 46. To show loss of water from leaves, the leaves\r\njust covered.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 47. After a few hours drops of water have\r\naccumulated on the inside of the jar covering the leaves.]\r\n\r\n=70. Loss of water from growing plants.=—Suppose we now take a\r\nsmall and actively growing plant in a pot, and cover the pot and the\r\nsoil with a sheet of rubber cloth or flexible oilcloth which fits\r\ntightly around the stem of the plant so that the moisture from the soil\r\nor from the surface of the pot cannot escape. Then place a bell jar\r\nover the plant, and set in a brightly lighted place, at a temperature\r\nsuitable for growth. In the course of a few minutes on a dry day a\r\nmoisture film forms on the inner surface of the glass, just as it did\r\nin the case of the glass jar containing the cut shoots and leaves.\r\nLater the moisture has condensed so that it is in the form of drops. If\r\nwe have the same leaf surface here as we had with the cut shoots, we\r\nshall probably find that a larger amount of water accumulates on the\r\nsurface of the jar from the plant that is still attached to its roots.\r\n\r\n=71. Water escapes from the surfaces of living leaves in the form of\r\nwater vapor.=—This living plant then has lost water, which also\r\nescapes in the form of water vapor. Since here there are no cut places\r\non the shoots or leaves, we infer that the loss of water vapor takes\r\nplace from the surfaces of the leaves and from the shoots. It is also\r\nto be noted that, while this plant is losing water from the surfaces of\r\nthe leaves, it does not wilt or lose its turgidity. The roots by their\r\nactivity and pressure supply water to take the place of that which is\r\ngiven off in the form of water vapor. This loss of water in the form of\r\nwater vapor by plants is _transpiration_.\r\n\r\n=72. A test for the escape of water vapor from plants.=—Make\r\na solution of cobalt chloride in water. Saturate several pieces of\r\nfilter paper with it. Allow them to dry. The water solution of cobalt\r\nchloride is red. The paper is also red when it is moist, but when it\r\nis thoroughly dry it is blue. It is very sensitive to moisture and the\r\nmoisture of the air is often sufficient to redden it. Before using dry\r\nthe paper in an oven or over a flame.\r\n\r\n=73.= Take two bell jars, as shown in fig. 49. Under one place a\r\npotted plant, the pot and earth being covered by oiled paper. Or cover\r\nthe plant with a fruit jar. To a stake in the pot pin a piece of the\r\ndried cobalt paper, and at the same time pin to a stake, in another\r\njar covering no plant, another piece of cobalt paper. They should both\r\nbe put under the jars at the same time. In a few moments the paper in\r\nthe jar with the plant will begin to redden. In a short while, ten or\r\nfifteen minutes, probably, it will be entirely red, while the paper\r\nunder the other jar will remain blue, or be only slightly reddened. The\r\nwater vapor passing off from the living plant comes in contact with\r\nthe sensitive cobalt chloride in the paper and reddens it before there\r\nis sufficient vapor present to condense as a film of moisture on the\r\nsurface of the jar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 48.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 49.\r\n\r\nFig. 48.—Water vapor is given off by the leaves when attached to the\r\nliving plant. It condenses into drops of water on the cool surface of\r\nthe glass covering the plant.\r\n\r\nFig. 49.—A good way to show that the water passes off from the leaves\r\nin the form of water vapor.]\r\n\r\n=74. Experiment to compare loss of water in a dry and a humid\r\natmosphere.=—We should now compare the escape of water from the\r\nleaves of a plant covered by a bell jar, as in the last experiment,\r\nwith that which takes place when the plant is exposed in a normal way\r\nin the air of the room or in the open. To do this we should select\r\ntwo plants of the same kind growing in pots, and of approximately the\r\nsame leaf surface. The potted plants are placed one each on the arms\r\nof a scale. One of the plants is covered in this position with a bell\r\njar. With weights placed on the pan of the other arm the two sides are\r\nbalanced. In the course of an hour, if the air of the room is dry,\r\nmoisture has probably accumulated on the inner surface of the glass jar\r\nwhich is used to cover one of the plants. This indicates that there has\r\nhere been a loss of water. But there is no escape of water vapor into\r\nthe surrounding air so that the weight on this arm is practically the\r\nsame as at the beginning of the experiment. We see, however, that the\r\nother arm of the balance has risen. We infer that this is the result of\r\nthe loss of water vapor from the plant on that arm. Now let us remove\r\nthe bell jar from the other plant, and with a cloth wipe off all the\r\nmoisture from the inner surface, and replace the jar over the plant. We\r\nnote that the end of the scale which holds this plant is still lower\r\nthan the other end.\r\n\r\n=75. The loss of water is greater in a dry than in a humid\r\natmosphere.=—This teaches us that while water vapor escaped from\r\nthe plant under the bell jar, the air in this receiver soon became\r\nsaturated with the moisture, and thus the farther escape of moisture\r\nfrom the leaves was checked. It also teaches us another very important\r\nfact, viz., that plants lose water more rapidly through their leaves in\r\na dry air than in a humid or moist atmosphere. We can now understand\r\nwhy it is that during the very hot and dry part of certain days plants\r\noften wilt, while at nightfall, when the atmosphere is more humid, they\r\nrevive. They lose more water through their leaves during the dry part\r\nof the day, other things being equal, than at other times.\r\n\r\n=76. How transpiration takes place.=—Since the water of transpiration\r\npasses off in the form of water vapor we are led to inquire if this\r\nprocess is simply _evaporation_ of water through the surface of the\r\nleaves, or whether it is controlled to any appreciable extent by any\r\ncondition of the living plant. An experiment which is instructive in\r\nthis respect we shall find in a comparison between the transpiration of\r\nwater from the leaves of a cut shoot, allowed to lie unprotected in a\r\ndry room, and a similar cut shoot the leaves of which have been killed.\r\n\r\n=77.= Almost any plant will answer for the experiment. For this\r\npurpose I have used the following method. Small branches of the locust\r\n(Robinia pseudacacia), of sweet clover (Melilotus alba), and of a\r\nheliopsis were selected. One set of the shoots was immersed for a\r\nmoment in hot water near the boiling point to kill them. The other set\r\nwas immersed for the same length of time in cold water, so that the\r\nsurfaces of the leaves might be well wetted, and thus the two sets of\r\nleaves at the beginning of the experiment would be similar, so far as\r\nthe amount of water on their surfaces is concerned. All the shoots were\r\nthen spread out on a table in a dry room, the leaves of the killed\r\nshoots being separated where they are inclined to cling together. In\r\na short while all the water has evaporated from the surface of the\r\nliving leaves, while the leaves of the dead shoots are still wet on\r\nthe surface. In six hours the leaves of the dead shoots from which the\r\nsurface water had now evaporated were beginning to dry up, while the\r\nleaves of the living plants were only becoming flaccid. In twenty-four\r\nhours the leaves of the dead shoots were crisp and brittle, while those\r\nof the living shoots were only wilted. In twenty-four hours more the\r\nleaves of the sweet clover and of the heliopsis were still soft and\r\nflexible, showing that they still contained more water than the killed\r\nshoots which had been crisp for more than a day.\r\n\r\n=78.= It must be then that during what is termed transpiration\r\nthe living plant is capable of holding back the water to some extent,\r\nwhich in a dead plant would escape more rapidly by evaporation. It is\r\nalso known that a body of water with a surface equal to that of a given\r\nleaf surface of a plant loses more water by evaporation during the same\r\nlength of time than the plant loses by transpiration.\r\n\r\n=79. Structure of a leaf.=—We are now led to inquire why it is\r\nthat a living leaf loses water less rapidly than dead ones, and why\r\nless water escapes from a given leaf surface than from an equal surface\r\nof water. To understand this it will be necessary to examine the minute\r\nstructure of a leaf. For this purpose we may select the leaf of an ivy,\r\nthough many other leaves will answer equally well. From a portion of\r\nthe leaf we should make very thin cross-sections with a razor or other\r\nsharp instrument. These sections should be perpendicular to the surface\r\nof the leaf and should be then mounted in water for microscopic\r\nexamination.[6]\r\n\r\n=80. Epidermis of the leaf.=—In this section we see that the\r\ngreen part of the leaf is bordered on what are its upper and lower\r\nsurfaces by a row of cells which possess no green color. The walls of\r\nthe cells of each row have nearly parallel sides, and the cross walls\r\nare perpendicular. These cells form a single layer over both surfaces\r\nof the leaf and are termed the _epidermis_. Their walls are quite stout\r\nand the outer walls are _cuticularized_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 50. Section through ivy leaf showing communication\r\nbetween stomate and the large intercellular spaces of the leaf, stoma\r\nclosed.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 51. Stoma open.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 52. Stoma closed.\r\n\r\nFigs. 51, 52.—Section through stomata of ivy leaf.]\r\n\r\n=81. Soft tissue of the leaf.=—The cells which contain the green\r\nchlorophyll bodies are arranged in two different ways. Those on the\r\nupper side of the leaf are usually long and prismatic in form and\r\nlie closely parallel to each other. Because of this arrangement of\r\nthese cells they are termed the _palisade_ cells, and form what is\r\ncalled the _palisade layer_. The other green cells, lying below, vary\r\ngreatly in size in different plants and to some extent also in the same\r\nplant. Here we notice that they are elongated, or oval, or somewhat\r\nirregular in form. The most striking peculiarity, however, in their\r\narrangement is that they are not usually packed closely together, but\r\neach cell touches the other adjacent cells only at certain points. This\r\narrangement of these cells forms quite large spaces between them, the\r\nintercellular spaces. If we should examine such a section of a leaf\r\nbefore it is mounted in water we would see that the intercellular\r\nspaces are not filled with water or cell-sap, but are filled with air\r\nor some gas. Within the cells, on the other hand, we find the cell-sap\r\nand the protoplasm.\r\n\r\n=82. Stomata.=—If we examine carefully the row of epidermal cells\r\non the under surface of the leaf, we find here and there a peculiar\r\narrangement of cells shown at figs. 51, 52. This opening through the\r\nepidermal layer is a _stoma_. The cells which immediately surround the\r\nopenings are the _guard cells_. The form of the guard cells can be\r\nbetter seen if we tear a leaf in such a way as to strip off a short\r\npiece of the lower epidermis, and mount this in water. The guard cells\r\nare nearly crescent-shaped, and the stoma is elliptical in outline. The\r\nepidermal cells are very irregular in outline in this view. We should\r\nalso note that while the epidermal cells contain no chlorophyll, the\r\nguard cells do.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 53. Portion of epidermis of ivy, showing irregular\r\nepidermal cells, stoma and guard cells.]\r\n\r\n=82=_a_. In the ivy leaf the guard cells are quite plain, but in\r\nmost plants the form as seen in cross-section is irregular in outline,\r\nas shown in fig. 53_a_, which is from a section of a wintergreen leaf.\r\nThis leaf is interesting because it shows the characteristic structure\r\nof leaves of many plants growing in soil where absorption of water by\r\nthe roots is difficult owing to the cold water, acids, or salts in the\r\nwater or soil, or in dry soil (see Chapters 47, 54, 55). The cuticle\r\nover the upper epidermis is quite thick. This lessens the loss of water\r\nby the leaf. The compact palisades of cells are in two to three cell\r\nlayers, also reducing the loss of water.\r\n\r\n=83. The living protoplasm retards the evaporation of water from the\r\nleaf.=—If we now take into consideration a few facts which we have\r\nlearned in a previous chapter, with reference to the physical\r\nproperties of the living cell, we shall be able to give a partial\r\nexplanation of the comparative slowness with which the water escapes\r\nfrom the leaves. The inner surfaces of the cell walls are lined with\r\nthe membrane of protoplasm, and within this is the cell-sap. These\r\ncells have become turgid by the absorption of the water which has\r\npassed up to them from the roots. While the protoplasmic membrane of\r\nthe cells does not readily permit the water to filter through, yet it\r\nis saturated with water, and the elastic cell wall with which it is in\r\ncontact is also saturated. From the cell wall the water evaporates into\r\nthe intercellular spaces. But the water is given up slowly through the\r\nprotoplasmic membrane, so that the water vapor cannot be given off as\r\nrapidly from the cell walls as it could if the protoplasm were dead.\r\nThe living protoplasmic membrane then which is only slowly permeable to\r\nthe water of the cell-sap is here a very important factor in checking\r\nthe too rapid loss of water from the leaves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 53_a_.\r\n\r\nCross-section of leaf of wintergreen. _Cu._, cuticle; _Epid._,\r\nepidermis; _v.d._, vascular duct; _Int. c. sp._, intercellular space;\r\n_L. ep._, lower epidermis; _St._, stoma.]\r\n\r\nBy an examination of our leaf section we see that the intercellular\r\nspaces are all connected, and that the stomata, where they occur, open\r\nalso into intercellular spaces. There is here an opportunity for the\r\nwater vapor in the intercellular spaces to escape when the stomata are\r\nopen.\r\n\r\n=84. Action of the stomata.=—The guard cells serve an important\r\nfunction in regulating transpiration. During normal transpiration the\r\nguard cells are turgid and their peculiar form then causes them to arch\r\naway from each other, allowing the escape of water vapor. When the air\r\nbecomes too dry transpiration is in excess of absorption by the roots.\r\nThe guard cells lose some of their water, and collapse so that their\r\ninner faces meet in a straight line and close the stoma. Thus the rapid\r\ntranspiration is checked. Some evaporation of water vapor, however,\r\ntakes place through the epidermal cells, and if the air remains too\r\ndry, the leaves eventually become flaccid and droop. During the day\r\nthe effect of sunlight is to increase certain sugars or salts in the\r\nguard cells so that they readily become turgid and open the stomates,\r\nbut at night the cell-sap is less concentrated and the stomates are\r\nusually closed. Light therefore favors transpiration, while in darkness\r\ntranspiration is checked.\r\n\r\n=85. Compare transpiration from the two surfaces of the leaf.=—This can\r\nbe done by using the cobalt chloride paper. This paper can be kept from\r\nyear to year and used repeatedly. It is thus a very simple matter to\r\nmake these experiments. Provide two pieces of glass (discarded glass\r\nnegatives, cleaned, are excellent), two pieces of cobalt chloride\r\npaper, and some geranium leaves entirely free from surface water. Dry\r\nthe paper until it is blue. Place one piece of the paper on a glass\r\nplate; place the geranium leaf with the under side on the paper. On the\r\nupper side of the leaf now place the other cobalt paper, and next the\r\nsecond piece of glass. On the pile place a light weight to keep the\r\nparts well in contact. In fifteen or twenty minutes open and examine.\r\nThe paper next the under side of the geranium leaf is red where it lies\r\nunder the leaf. The paper on the upper side is only slightly reddened.\r\nThe greater loss of water, then, is through the under side of the\r\ngeranium leaf. This is true of a great many leaves, but it is not true\r\nof all.\r\n\r\n=86. Negative pressure.=—This is not only indicated by the\r\ndrooping of the leaves, but may be determined in another way. If the\r\nshoot of such a plant be cut underneath mercury, or underneath a strong\r\nsolution of eosin, it will be found that some of the mercury or eosin,\r\nas the case may be, will be forcibly drawn up into the stem toward the\r\nroots. This is seen on quickly splitting the cut end of the stem. When\r\nplants in the open cannot be obtained in this condition, one may take\r\na plant like a balsam plant from the greenhouse, or some other potted\r\nplant, knock it out of the pot, free the roots from the soil and allow\r\nto partly wilt. The stem may then be held under the eosin solution and\r\ncut.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 54. Experiment to show lifting power of\r\ntranspiration.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 55.\r\n\r\nEstimation of the amount of transpiration. The tubes are filled with\r\nwater, and as the water transpires from the leaf surface its movement\r\nin the tube from _a_ to _b_ can be measured. (After Mangin.)]\r\n\r\n=87. Lifting power of transpiration.=—Not only does transpiration\r\ngo on quite independently of root pressure, as we have discovered\r\nfrom other experiments, but transpiration is capable of exerting a\r\nlifting power on the water in the plant. This may be demonstrated in\r\nthe following way: Place the cut end of a leafy shoot in one end of a\r\nU tube and fit it water-tight. Partly fill this arm of the U tube with\r\nwater, and add mercury to the other arm until it stands at a level in\r\nthe two arms as in fig. 54. In a short time we note that the mercury is\r\nrising in the tube.\r\n\r\n=88. Root pressure may exceed transpiration.=—If we cover small\r\nactively growing plants, such as the pea, corn, wheat, bean, etc.,\r\nwith a bell jar, and place them in the sunlight where the temperature\r\nis suitable for growth, in a few hours, if conditions are favorable,\r\nwe shall see that there are drops of water standing out on the margins\r\nof the leaves. These drops of water have exuded through the ordinary\r\nstomata, or in other cases what are called water stomata, through the\r\ninfluence of root pressure. The plant being covered by the glass jar,\r\nthe air soon becomes saturated with moisture and transpiration is\r\nchecked. Root pressure still goes on, however, and the result is shown\r\nin the exuding drops. Root pressure is here in excess of transpiration.\r\nThis phenomenon is often to be observed during the summer season in the\r\ncase of low-growing plants. During the bright warm day transpiration\r\nequals, or may be in excess of, root pressure, and the leaves are\r\nconsequently flaccid. As nightfall comes on the air becomes more\r\nmoist, and the conditions of light are such also that transpiration\r\nis lessened. Root pressure, however, is still active because the soil\r\nis still warm. In these cases drops of water may be seen exuding from\r\nthe margins of the leaves due to the excess of root pressure over\r\ntranspiration. Were it not for this provision for the escape of the\r\nexcess of water raised by root pressure, serious injury by lesions, as\r\na result of the great pressure, might result. The plant is thus to some\r\nextent a self-regulatory piece of apparatus so far as root pressure and\r\ntranspiration are concerned.\r\n\r\n=89. Injuries caused by excessive root pressure.=—Some varieties\r\nof tomatoes when grown in poorly lighted and poorly ventilated\r\ngreenhouses suffer serious injury through lesions of the tissues.\r\nThis is brought about by the cells at certain parts becoming charged\r\nso full with water through the activity of root pressure and lessened\r\ntranspiration, assisted also probably by an accumulation of certain\r\nacids in the cell-sap which cannot be got rid of by transpiration.\r\nUnder these conditions some of the cells here swell out, forming\r\nextensive cushions, and the cell walls become so weakened that they\r\nburst. It is possible to imitate the excess of root pressure in the\r\ncase of some plants by connecting the stems with a system of water\r\npressure, when very quickly the drops of water will begin to exude from\r\nthe margins of the leaves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 56.\r\n\r\nThe roots are lifting more water into the plant than can be given off\r\nin the form of water vapor, so it is pressed out in drops. From “First\r\nStudies Plant Life.”]\r\n\r\n=90.= It should be stated that in reality there is no difference\r\nbetween transpiration and evaporation, if we bear in mind that\r\nevaporation takes place more slowly from living plants than from dead\r\nones, or from an equal surface of water.\r\n\r\n=91.= The escape of water vapor is not the only function of the\r\nstomata. The exchange of gases takes place through them as we shall\r\nlater see. A large number of experiments show that normally the stomata\r\nare open when the leaves are turgid. But when plants lose excessive\r\nquantities of water on dry and hot days, so that the leaves become\r\nflaccid, the guard cells automatically close the stomata to check the\r\nescape of water vapor. Some water escapes through the epidermis of many\r\nplants, though the cuticularized membrane of the epidermis largely\r\nprevents evaporation. In arid regions plants are usually provided\r\nwith an epidermis of several layers of cells to more securely prevent\r\nevaporation there. In such cases the guard cells are often protected by\r\nbeing sunk deeply in the epidermal layer.\r\n\r\n=92. Demonstration of stomates and intercellular air spaces.=—A\r\ngood demonstration of the presence of stomates in leaves, as well as\r\nthe presence and intercommunication of the intercellular spaces, can be\r\nmade by blowing into the cut end of the petiole of the leaf of a calla\r\nlily, the lamina being immersed in water. The air is forced out\r\nthrough the stomata and rises as bubbles to the surface of the water.\r\nAt the close of the experiment some of the air bubbles will still be\r\nin contact with the leaf surface at the opening of the stomata. The\r\npressure of the water gradually forces this back into the leaf. Other\r\nplants will answer for the experiment, but some are more suitable than\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n=92a. Number of stomata.=—The larger number of stomata are on the\r\nunder side of the leaf. (In leaves which float on the surface of the\r\nwater all of the stomata are on the upper side of the leaf, as in the\r\nwater-lily.) It has been estimated by investigation that in general\r\nthere are 40-300 stomata to the square millimeter of surface. In some\r\nplants this number is exceeded, as in the olive, where there are 625.\r\nIn an entire leaf of Brassica rapa there are about 11,000,000 stomata,\r\nand in an entire leaf of the sunflower there are about 13,000,000\r\nstomata.\r\n\r\n=92b. Amount of water transpired by plants.=—The amount of water\r\ntranspired by plants is very great. According to careful estimates a\r\nsunflower 6 feet high transpires on the average about one quart per\r\nday; an acre of cabbages 2,000,000 quarts in four months; an oak tree\r\nwith 700,000 leaves transpires about 180 gallons of water per day.\r\nAccording to von Höhnel, a beech tree 110 years old transpired about\r\n2250 gallons of water in one summer. A hectare of such trees (about 400\r\non 2½ acres) would at the same rate transpire about 900,000 gallons, or\r\nabout 30,000 barrels in one summer.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[6] Demonstrations may be made with prepared sections of leaves,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nPATH OF MOVEMENT OF WATER IN PLANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=93.= In our study of root pressure and transpiration we have seen\r\nthat large quantities of water or solutions move upward through the\r\nstems of plants. We are now led to inquire through what part of the\r\nstems the liquid passes in this upward movement, or in other words,\r\nwhat is the path of the “sap” as it rises in the stem. This we can\r\nreadily see by the following trial.\r\n\r\n=94. Place the cut ends of leafy shoots in a solution of some of\r\nthe red dyes.=—We may cut off leafy shoots of various plants and\r\ninsert the cut ends in a vessel of water to which have been added a few\r\ncrystals of the dye known as fuchsin to make a deep red color (other\r\nred dyes may be used, but this one is especially good). If the study is\r\nmade during the summer, the “touch-me-not” (impatiens) will be found a\r\nvery useful plant, or the garden balsam, which may also be had in the\r\nwinter from conservatories. Almost any plant will do, however, but we\r\nshould also select one like the corn plant (zea mays) if in the summer,\r\nor the petioles of a plant like caladium, which can be obtained from\r\nthe conservatory. If seedlings of the castor-oil bean are at hand we\r\nmay cut off some shoots which are 8-10 inches high, and place them in\r\nthe solution also.\r\n\r\n=95. These solutions color the tracts in the stem and leaves through\r\nwhich they flow.=—After a few hours in the case of the impatiens,\r\nor the more tender plants, we can see through the stem that certain\r\ntracts are colored red by the solution, and after 12 to 24 hours there\r\nmay be seen a red coloration of the leaves of some of the plants\r\nused. After the shoots have been standing in the solution for a few\r\nhours, if we cut them at various places we will note that there are\r\nseveral points in the section where the tissues are colored red. In\r\nthe impatiens perhaps from four to five, in the sunflower a larger\r\nnumber. In these plants the colored areas on a cross-section of the\r\nstem are situated in a concentric ring which separates more or less\r\ncompletely an outer ring of the stem from the central portion. If we\r\nnow split portions of the stem lengthwise we see that these colored\r\nareas continue throughout the length of the stem, in some cases even up\r\nto the leaves and into them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 57. Broken corn stalk, showing fibrovascular\r\nbundles.]\r\n\r\n=96.= If we cut across the stem of a corn plant which has been\r\nin the solution, we see that instead of the colored areas being in\r\na concentric ring they are irregularly scattered, and on splitting\r\nthe stem we see here also that these colored areas extend for long\r\ndistances through the stem. If we take a corn stem which is mature, or\r\nan old and dead one, cut around through the outer hard tissues, and\r\nthen break the stem at this point, from the softer tissue long strings\r\nof tissue will pull out as shown in fig. 57. These strings of denser\r\ntissue correspond to the areas which are colored by the dye. They are\r\nin the form of minute bundles, and are called _vascular bundles_.\r\n\r\n=97.= We thus see that instead of the liquids passing through the\r\nentire stem they are confined to definite courses. Now that we have\r\ndiscovered the path of the upward movement of water in the stem, we are\r\ncurious to see what the structure of these definite portions of the\r\nstem is.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 58.\r\n\r\nXylem portion of bundle. Cambium portion of bundle. Bast portion of\r\nbundle.\r\n\r\nSection of vascular bundle of sunflower stem.]\r\n\r\n=98. Structure of the fibrovascular bundles.=—We should now make\r\nquite thin cross-sections, either free hand and mount in water for\r\nmicroscopic examination, or they may be made with a microtome and\r\nmounted in Canada balsam, and in this condition will answer for future\r\nstudy. To illustrate the structure of the bundle in one type we may\r\ntake the stem of the castor-oil bean. On examining these cross-sections\r\nwe see that there are groups of cells which are denser than the ground\r\ntissue. These groups correspond to the colored areas in the former\r\nexperiments, and are the vascular bundles cut across. These groups are\r\nsomewhat oval in outline, with the pointed end directed toward the\r\ncenter of the stem. If we look at the section as a whole we see that\r\nthere is a narrow continuous ring[7] of small cells situated at the\r\nsame distance from the center of the stem as the middle part of the\r\nbundles, and that it divides the bundles into two groups of cells.\r\n\r\n=99. Woody portion of the bundle.=—In that portion of the bundle\r\non the inside of the ring, i.e., toward the “pith,” we note large,\r\ncircular, or angular cavities. The walls of these cells are quite thick\r\nand woody. They are therefore called wood cells, and because they\r\nare continuous with cells above and below them in the stem in such a\r\nway that long tubes are formed, they are called woody vessels. Mixed\r\nin with these are smaller cells, some of which also have thick walls\r\nand are wood cells. Some of these cells may have thin walls. This\r\nis the case with all when they are young, and they are then classed\r\nwith the fundamental tissue or soft tissue (parenchyma). This part of\r\nthe bundle, since it contains woody vessels and fibres, is the _wood\r\nportion_ of the bundle, or technically the _xylem_.\r\n\r\n=100. Bast portion of the bundle.=—If our section is through a\r\npart of the stem which is not too young, the tissues of the outer part\r\nof the bundle will show either one or several groups of cells which\r\nhave white and shiny walls, that are thickened as much or more than\r\nthose of the wood vessels. These cells are _bast_ cells, and for this\r\nreason this part of the bundle is the _bast_ portion, or the _phloem_.\r\nIntermingled with these, cells may often be found which have thin\r\nwalls, unless the bundle is very old. Nearer the center of the bundle\r\nand still within the bast portion are cells with thin walls, angular\r\nand irregularly arranged. This is the softer portion of the bast, and\r\nsome of these cells are what are called _sieve_ tubes, which can be\r\nbetter seen and studied in a longitudinal section of the stem.\r\n\r\n=101. Cambium region of the bundle.=—Extending across the center\r\nof the bundle are several rows of small cells, the smallest of the\r\nbundle, and we can see that they are more regularly arranged, usually\r\nin quite regular rows, like bricks piled upon one another. These cells\r\nhave thinner walls than any others of the bundle, and they usually take\r\na deeper stain when treated with a solution of some of the dyes. This\r\nis because they are younger, and are therefore richer in protoplasmic\r\ncontents. This zone of young cells across the bundle is the _cambium_.\r\nIts cells grow and divide, and thus increase the size of the bundle.\r\nBy this increase in the number of the cells of the cambium layer, the\r\noutermost cells on either side are continually passing over into the\r\nphloem, on the one hand, and into the wood portion of the bundle, on\r\nthe other hand.\r\n\r\n=102. Longitudinal section of the bundle.=—If we make thin\r\nlongisections of the vascular bundle of the castor-oil seedling (or\r\nother dicotyledon) so that we have thin ones running through a bundle\r\nradially, as shown in fig. 59, we can see the structure of these parts\r\nof the bundle in side view. We see here that the form of the cells is\r\nvery different from what is presented in a cross-section of the same.\r\nThe walls of the various ducts have peculiar markings on them. These\r\nmarkings are caused by the walls being thicker in some places than in\r\nothers, and this thickening takes place so regularly in some instances\r\nas to form regular spiral thickenings. Others have the thickenings in\r\nthe form of the rounds of a ladder, while still others have pitted\r\nwalls or the thickenings are in the form of rings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 59.\r\n\r\nLongitudinal section of vascular bundle of sunflower stem; spiral,\r\nscalariform and pitted vessels at left; next are wood fibers with\r\noblique cross walls; in middle are cambium cells with straight cross\r\nwalls, next two sieve tubes, then phloem or bast cells.]\r\n\r\n=103. Vessels or ducts.=—One way in which the cells in side view\r\ndiffer greatly from an end view, in a cross-section in the bundle, is\r\nthat they are much longer in the direction of the axis of the stem. The\r\ncells have become elongated greatly. If we search for the place where\r\ntwo of these large cells with spiral, or ladder-like, markings meet end\r\nto end, we see that the wall which formerly separated the cells has\r\nnearly or quite disappeared. In other words the two cells have now an\r\nopen communication at the ends. This is so for long distances in the\r\nstem, so that long columns of these large cells form tubes or vessels\r\nthrough which the water rises in the stems of plants.\r\n\r\n=104.= In the bast portion of the bundle we detect the cells of\r\nthe bast fibers by their thick walls. They are very much elongated and\r\nthe ends taper out to thin points so that they overlap. In this way\r\nthey serve to strengthen the stem.\r\n\r\n=105. Sieve tubes.=—Lying near the bast cells, usually toward\r\nthe cambium, are elongated cells standing end to end, with delicate\r\nmarkings on their cross walls which appear like finely punctured plates\r\nor sieves. The protoplasm in such cells is usually quite distinct, and\r\nsometimes contracted away from the side walls, but attached to the\r\ncross walls, and this aids in the detection of the sieve tubes (fig.\r\n59.) The granular appearance which these plates present is caused by\r\nminute perforations through the wall so that there is a communication\r\nbetween the cells. The tubes thus formed are therefore called sieve\r\ntubes and they extend for long distances through the tube so that there\r\nis communication throughout the entire length of the stem. (The\r\nfunction of the sieve tubes is supposed to be that for the downward\r\ntransportation of substances elaborated in the leaves.)\r\n\r\n=106.= If we section in like manner the stem of the sunflower we\r\nshall see similar bundles, but the number is greater than eight. In\r\nthe garden balsam the number is from four to six in an ordinary stem\r\n3-4_mm_ diameter. Here we can see quite well the origin of the vascular\r\nbundle. Between the larger bundles we can see especially in free-hand\r\nsections of stems through which a colored solution has been lifted by\r\ntranspiration, as in our former experiments, small groups of the minute\r\ncells in the cambial ring which are colored. These groups of cells\r\nwhich form strands running through the stem are _pro-cambium strands_.\r\nThe cells divide and increase just like the cambium cells, and the\r\nolder ones thrown off on either side change, those toward the center\r\nof the stem to wood vessels and fibers, and those on the outer side to\r\nbast cells and sieve tubes.\r\n\r\n=107. Fibrovascular bundles in the Indian corn.=—We should now\r\nmake a thin transection of a portion of the center of the stem of\r\nIndian corn, in order to compare the structure of the bundle with that\r\nof the plants which we have just examined. In fig. 60 is represented a\r\nfibrovascular bundle of the stem of the Indian corn. The large cells\r\nare those of the spiral and reticulated and annular vessels. This is\r\nthe woody portion of the bundle or xylem. Opposite this is the bast\r\nportion or phloem, marked by the lighter colored tissue at _i_. The\r\nlarger of these cells are the sieve tubes, and intermingled with them\r\nare smaller cells with thin walls. Surrounding the entire bundle are\r\nsmall cells with thick walls. These are elongated and the tapering ends\r\noverlap. They are thus slender and long and form fibers. In such a\r\nbundle all of the cambium has passed over into permanent tissue and is\r\nsaid to be closed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 60.\r\n\r\nTransection of fibrovascular bundle of Indian corn. _a_, toward\r\nperiphery of stem; _g_, large pitted vessels; _s_, spiral vessel; _r_,\r\nannular vessel; _l_, air cavity formed by breaking apart of the cells;\r\n_i_, soft bast, a form of sieve tissue; _p_, thin-walled parenchyma.\r\n(Sachs.)]\r\n\r\n=108. Rise of water in the vessels.=—During the movement of the\r\nwater or nutrient solutions upward in the stem the vessels of the wood\r\nportion of the bundle in certain plants are nearly or quite filled,\r\nif root pressure is active and transpiration is not very rapid. If,\r\nhowever, on dry days transpiration is in excess of root pressure, as\r\noften happens, the vessels are not filled with the water, but are\r\npartly filled with certain gases because the air or other gases in\r\nthe plant become rarefied as a result of the excessive loss of water.\r\nThere are then successive rows of air or gas bubbles in the vessels\r\nseparated by films of water which also line the walls of the vessels.\r\nThe condition of the vessel is much like that of a glass tube through\r\nwhich one might pass the “froth” which is formed on the surface of\r\nsoapy water. This forms a chain of bubbles in the vessels. This chain\r\nhas been called Jamin’s chain because of the discoverer.\r\n\r\n=109.= Why water or food solutions can be raised by the plant\r\nto the height attained by some trees has never been satisfactorily\r\nexplained. There are several theories propounded which cannot be\r\ndiscussed here. It is probably a very complex process. Root pressure\r\nand transpiration both play a part, or at least can be shown, as we\r\nhave seen, to be capable of lifting water to a considerable height. In\r\naddition to this, the walls of the vessels absorb water by diffusion,\r\nand in the other elements of the bundle capillarity comes also into\r\nplay, as well as osmosis.\r\n\r\nSee Organization of Tissues, Chapter 38.\r\n\r\n=110. Flow of sap in the spring.=—The cause of the bleeding of\r\ntrees and the flow of sap in the spring is little understood. One of\r\nthe remarkable cases is the flow of sap in maple trees. It begins\r\nin early spring and ceases as the buds are opening, and seems to be\r\ninitiated by alternation of high and low temperatures of day and night.\r\nIt has been found that the pressures inside of the tree at this time\r\nare enormously increased during the day, when the temperature rises\r\nafter a cold night. This has led to the belief that the pressure is\r\ncaused by the expansion of the gases in the vascular ducts. The warming\r\nup of the twigs and branches of the tree would take place rapidly\r\nduring the day, while the interior of the trunk would be only slightly\r\naffected. The pressures then would cause the sap to flow downward\r\nduring the day, and at night the branches becoming cool, sap would flow\r\nback again from the roots and trunk.\r\n\r\nRecent experiments by Jones _et al._ show that while some of the\r\npressure is due to the expansion of gas in the tree by the rise of\r\ntemperature, this cannot account for the enormous pressures which are\r\noften present, for example, when after a rise in the temperature of 2°\r\nC. there was an increase of 20 lbs. pressure.\r\n\r\nThen again, after the cessation of the flow in late spring there are\r\noften as great differences between night and day temperatures. It\r\ntherefore seems reasonable to conclude that the expansion of gases by a\r\nrise in temperature is not the direct cause.\r\n\r\n=Activities of the cells.=—It has been suggested by some that\r\nthe rise in temperature exercises an influence on the protoplasts,\r\nor living cells, so that they are stimulated to a special activity\r\nresulting in an exudation pressure from the individual cells, which is\r\nknown to take place. With the fall of temperature at night this\r\nactivity would cease and there might result a lessened pressure in\r\nthe cells. Since the specific activities of cells are known to vary\r\nin different plants, and in the same plant at different seasons, some\r\nsupport is gained for this theory, though it is generally believed that\r\nthe activities of the living cells in the stems are not necessary for\r\nthe upward flow of water. It must be admitted, however, that at present\r\nwe know very little about this interesting problem.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[7] This ring and the bundles separate the stem into two regions,\r\nan outer one composed of large cells with thin walls, known as the\r\ncortical cells, or collectively the _cortex_. The inner portion,\r\ncorresponding to what is called the pith, is made up of the same kind\r\nof cells and is called the _medulla_, or _pith_. When the cells of\r\nthe cortex, as well as of the pith, remain thin walled the tissue is\r\ncalled parenchyma. Parenchyma belongs to the group of tissues called\r\nfundamental.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nMECHANICAL USES OF WATER.\r\n\r\n\r\n=111. Turgidity of plant parts.=—As we have seen by the experiments on\r\nthe leaves, turgescence of the cells is one of the conditions which\r\nenables the leaves to stand out from the stem, and the lamina of the\r\nleaves to remain in an expanded position, so that they are better\r\nexposed to the light, and to the currents of air. Were it not for this\r\nturgidity the leaves would hang down close against the stem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 61. Restoration of turgidity (Sachs).]\r\n\r\n=112. Restoration of turgidity in shoots.=—If we cut off a living\r\nstem of geranium, coleus, tomato, or “balsam,” and allow the leaves\r\nto partly wilt so that the shoot loses its turgidity, it is possible\r\nfor this shoot to regain turgidity. The end may be freshly cut again,\r\nplaced in a vessel of water, covered with a bell jar and kept in a room\r\nwhere the temperature is suitable for the growth of the plant. The\r\nshoot will usually become turgid again from the water which is absorbed\r\nthrough the cut end of the stem and is carried into the leaves where\r\nthe individual cells become turgid, and the leaves are again expanded.\r\nSuch shoots, and the excised leaves also, may often be made turgid\r\nagain by simply immersing them in water, as one of the experiments with\r\nthe salt solution would teach.\r\n\r\n=113.= Turgidity may be restored more certainly and quickly in a\r\npartially wilted shoot in another way. The cut end of the shoot may be\r\ninserted in a U tube as shown in fig. 61, the end of the tube around\r\nthe stem of the plant being made air-tight. The arm of the tube in\r\nwhich the stem is inserted is filled with water and the water is\r\nallowed to partly fill the other arm. Into this other arm is then\r\npoured mercury. The greater weight of the mercury causes such pressure\r\nupon the water that it is pushed into the stem, where it passes up\r\nthrough the vessels in the stems and leaves, and is brought more\r\nquickly and surely to the cells which contain the protoplasm and\r\ncell-sap, so that turgidity is more quickly and certainly attained.\r\n\r\n=114. Tissue tensions.=—Besides the turgescence of the cells\r\nof the leaves and shoots there are certain tissue tensions without\r\nwhich certain tender and succulent shoots, etc., would be limp, and\r\nwould droop. There are a number of plants usually accessible, some at\r\none season and some at others, which may be used to illustrate tissue\r\ntension.\r\n\r\n=115. Longitudinal tissue tension.=—For this in early summer one\r\nmay use the young and succulent shoots of the elder (sambucus); or the\r\npetioles of rhubarb during the summer and early autumn; or the petioles\r\nof richardia. Petioles of caladium are excellent for this purpose, and\r\nthese may be had at almost any season of the year from the greenhouses,\r\nand are thus especially advantageous for work during late autumn or\r\nwinter. The tension is so strong that a portion of such a petiole\r\n10-15_cm_ long is ample to demonstrate it. As we grasp the lower end of\r\nthe petiole of a caladium, or rhubarb leaf, we observe how rigid it is,\r\nand how well it supports the heavy expanded lamina of the leaf.\r\n\r\n=116.= The ends of a portion of such a petiole or other object\r\nwhich may be used are cut off squarely. With a knife a strip from\r\n2-3_mm_ in thickness is removed from one side the full length of the\r\nobject. This strip we now find is shorter than the larger part from\r\nwhich it was removed. The outer tissue then exerts a tension upon the\r\npetiole which tends to shorten it. Let us remove another strip lying\r\nnext this one, and another, and so on until the outer tissues remain\r\nonly upon one side. The object will now bend toward that side. Now\r\nremove this strip and compare the length of the strips removed with the\r\ncentral portion. We find that they are much shorter now. In other words\r\nthere is also a tension in the tissue of the central portion of the\r\npetiole, the direction of which is opposite to that of the superficial\r\ntissue. The parts of the petiole now are not rigid, and they easily\r\nbend. These two longitudinal tissue tensions acting in opposition to\r\neach other therefore give rigidity to the succulent shoot. It is only\r\nwhen the individual cells of such shoots or petioles are turgid that\r\nthese tissue tensions in succulent shoots manifest themselves or are\r\nprominent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 62. Strip from dandelion stem made to imitate a\r\nplant tendril.]\r\n\r\n=117.= To demonstrate the efficiency of this tension in giving\r\nsupport, let us take a long petiole of caladium or of rhubarb. Hold it\r\nby one end in a horizontal position. It is firm and rigid, and does not\r\ndroop, or but little. Remove all of the outer portion of the tissues,\r\nas described above, leaving only the central portion. Now attempt to\r\nhold it in a horizontal position by one end. It is flabby and droops\r\ndownward because the longitudinal tension is removed.\r\n\r\n=118. Longitudinal tension in dandelion stems.=—Take long\r\nand fresh dandelion stems. Split them. Note that they coil. The\r\nlongitudinal tension is very great. Place some of these strips in fresh\r\nwater. They coil up into close curls because by the absorption of water\r\nby the cells the turgescence of the individual cells is increased, and\r\nthis increases the tension in the stem. Now place them in salt water (a\r\n5 per cent solution). Why do they uncoil?\r\n\r\n=119. To imitate the coiling of a tendril.=—Cut out a narrow\r\nstrip from a long dandelion stem. Fasten to a piece of soft wood, with\r\nthe ends close together, as shown in fig. 62. Now place it in fresh\r\nwater and watch it coil. Part of it coils one way and part another way,\r\njust as a tendril does after the free end has caught hold of some place\r\nfor support.\r\n\r\n=120. Transverse tissue tension.=—To illustrate this one may take\r\na willow shoot 3-5_cm_ diameter and saw off sections about 2 cm long.\r\nCut through the bark on one side and peel it off in a single strip. Now\r\nattempt to replace it. The bark will not quite cover the wood again,\r\nsince the ends will not meet. It must then have been held in transverse\r\ntension by the woody part of the shoot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nSTARCH AND SUGAR FORMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The Gases Concerned.\r\n\r\n=121. Gas given off by green plants in the sunlight.=—Let us take\r\nsome green alga, like spirogyra, which is in a fresh condition, and\r\nplace one lot in a beaker or tall glass vessel of water and set this in\r\nthe direct sunlight or in a well lighted place. At the same time cover\r\na similar vessel of spirogyra with black cloth so that it will be in\r\nthe dark, or at least in very weak light.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 63. Oxygen gas given off by spirogyra.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 64. Bubbles of oxygen gas given off from elodea in\r\npresence of sunlight. (Oels.)]\r\n\r\n=122.= In a short time we note that in the first vessel small\r\nbubbles of gas are accumulating on the surface of the threads of the\r\nspirogyra, and now and then some free themselves and rise to the\r\nsurface of the water. Where there is quite a tangle of the threads the\r\ngas is apt to become caught and held back in larger bubbles, which on\r\nagitation of the vessel are freed.\r\n\r\nIf we now examine the second vessel we see that there are no bubbles,\r\nor only a very few of them. We are led to believe then that sunlight\r\nhas had something to do with the setting free of this gas from the\r\nplant.\r\n\r\n=123.= We may now take another alga-like vaucheria and perform the\r\nexperiment in the same way, or to save time the two may be set up at\r\nonce. In fact if we take any of the green algæ and treat them as\r\ndescribed above gas will be given off in a similar manner.\r\n\r\n=124.= We may now take one of the higher green plants, an aquatic\r\nplant like elodea, callitriche, etc. Place the plant in the water with\r\nthe cut end of the stem uppermost, but still immersed, the plant being\r\nweighted down by a glass rod or other suitable object. If we place the\r\nvessel of water containing these leafy stems in the bright sunlight,\r\nin a short time bubbles of gas will pass off quite rapidly from the\r\ncut end of the stem. If in the same vessel we place another stem, from\r\nwhich the leaves have been cut, the number of bubbles of gas given\r\noff will be very few. This indicates that a large part of the gas is\r\nfurnished by the leaves.\r\n\r\n=125.= Another vessel fitted up in the same way should be placed\r\nin the dark or shaded by covering with a box or black cloth. It will\r\nbe seen here, as in the case of spirogyra, that very few or no bubbles\r\nof gas will be set free. Sunlight here also is necessary for the rapid\r\nescape of the gas.\r\n\r\n=126.= We may easily compare the rapidity with which light of\r\nvarying intensity effects the setting free of this gas. After cutting\r\nthe end of the stem let us plunge the cut surface several times in\r\nmelted paraffine, or spread over the cut surface a coat of varnish.\r\nThen prick with a needle a small hole through the paraffine or varnish.\r\nImmerse the plant in water and place in sunlight as before. The gas now\r\ncomes from the puncture through the coating of the cut end, and the\r\nnumber of bubbles given off during a given period can be ascertained by\r\ncounting. If we duplicate this experiment by placing one plant in weak\r\nlight or diffused sunlight, and another in the shade, we can easily\r\ncompare the rapidity of the escape of the gas under the different\r\nconditions, which represent varying intensities of light. We see then\r\nthat not only is sunlight necessary for the setting free of this gas,\r\nbut that in diffused light or in the shade the activity of the plant in\r\nthis respect is less than in direct sunlight.\r\n\r\n=127. What this gas is.=—If we take quite a quantity of the\r\nplants of elodea and place them under an inverted funnel which is\r\nimmersed in water, the gas will be given off in quite large quantities\r\nand will rise into the narrow exit of the funnel. The funnel should be\r\none with a short tube, or the vessel one which is quite deep so that\r\na small test tube which is filled with water may in this condition be\r\ninverted over the opening of the funnel tube. With this arrangement\r\nof the experiment the gas will rise in the inverted test tube, slowly\r\ndisplace a portion of the water, and become collected in a sufficient\r\nquantity to afford us a test. When a considerable quantity has\r\naccumulated in the test tube, we may close the end of the tube in\r\nthe water with the thumb, lift it from the water and invert. The gas\r\nwill rise against the thumb. A dry soft-pine splinter should be then\r\nlighted, and after it has burned a short time, extinguish the flame by\r\nblowing upon it, when the still burning end of the splinter should be\r\nbrought to the mouth of the tube as the thumb is quickly moved to one\r\nside. The glowing of the splinter shows that the gas is _oxygen_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 65. Apparatus for collecting quantity of oxygen from\r\nelodea. (Detmer.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 66. Ready to see what the gas is.]\r\n\r\n=128.= It is better to allow the apparatus to stand several days\r\nin the sunlight in order to catch a full tube of the gas. Or on a sunny\r\nday carbon dioxide gas can be led into the water in the jar from a\r\ngenerator, such an one as is used for the evolution of CO₂. The CO₂\r\ncan be produced by the action of hydrochloric acid on bits of marble.\r\nThe CO₂ should not be run below the funnel. The test tube should be\r\nfastened so that the light oxygen gas will not raise it off the funnel.\r\nWith the tube full of gas the test for oxygen can be made by lifting\r\nthe tube with one hand and quickly thrusting the glowing end of the\r\nsplinter in with the other hand. If properly handled, the splinter will\r\nflame again. If it is necessary to keep the apparatus standing for more\r\nthan one day it is well to add fresh water in the place of most of the\r\nwater in the jar. Do not use leaves of land plants in this experiment,\r\nsince the bubbles which rise when these leaves are placed in water are\r\nnot evidence that this process is taking place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 67. The splinter lights again in the presence of\r\noxygen gas.]\r\n\r\n      =129. Oxygen given off by green land plants\r\n    also.=—If we should extend our experiments to land\r\n    plants we should find that oxygen is given off by them\r\n    under these conditions of light. Land plants, however,\r\n    will not do this when they are immersed in water, but\r\n    it is necessary to set up rather complicated apparatus\r\n    and to make analyses of the gases at the beginning and\r\n    at the close of the experiments. This has been done,\r\n    however, in a sufficiently large number of cases so\r\n    that we know that all green plants in the sunlight, if\r\n    temperature and other conditions are favorable, give\r\n    off oxygen.\r\n\r\n=130. Absorption of carbon dioxide.=—We have next to inquire\r\nwhere the oxygen comes from which is given off by green plants when\r\nexposed to the sunlight, and also to learn something more of the\r\nconditions necessary for the process. We know that water which has been\r\nfor some time exposed to the air and soil, and has been agitated, like\r\nrunning water of streams, or the water of springs, has mixed with it a\r\nconsiderable quantity of oxygen and carbon dioxide.\r\n\r\nIf we boil spring water or hydrant water which comes from a stream\r\ncontaining oxygen and carbon dioxide, for about 20 minutes, these\r\ngases are driven off. We should set this aside where it will not be\r\nagitated, until it has cooled sufficiently to receive plants without\r\ninjury. Let us now place some spirogyra or vaucheria, and elodea, or\r\nother green water plant, in this boiled water and set the vessel in the\r\nbright sunlight under the same conditions which were employed in the\r\nexperiments for the evolution of oxygen. No oxygen is given off.\r\n\r\nCan it be that this is because the oxygen was driven from the water in\r\nboiling? We shall see. Let us take the vessel containing the water,\r\nor some other boiled water, and agitate it so that the air will be\r\nthoroughly mixed with it. In this way oxygen is again mixed with the\r\nwater. Now place the plant again in the water, set in the sunlight, and\r\nin several minutes observe the result. No oxygen or but little is given\r\noff. There must be then some other requisite for the evolution of the\r\noxygen.\r\n\r\n=132. The gases are interchanged in the plants.=—We will now\r\nintroduce carbon dioxide again in the water. This can be done by\r\nleading CO₂ from a gas generator into the water. Broken bits of marble\r\nare placed in the generator, acted upon by hydrochloric acid, and the\r\ngas is led over by glass tubing. Now if we place the plant in the water\r\nand set the vessel in the sunlight, in a few minutes the oxygen is\r\ngiven off rapidly.\r\n\r\n=133. A chemical change of the gas takes place within the plant\r\ncell.=—This leads us to believe then that CO₂ is in some way\r\nnecessary for the plant in this process. Since oxygen is given off\r\nwhile carbon dioxide, a different gas, is necessary, it would seem that\r\na chemical change takes place in the gases within the plant. Since the\r\nprocess takes place in such simple plants as spirogyra as well as in\r\nthe more bulky and higher plants, it appears that the changes go on\r\nwithin the cell, in fact within the protoplasm.\r\n\r\n=134. Gases as well as water can diffuse through the protoplasmic\r\nmembrane.=—Carbon dioxide then is absorbed by the plant while\r\noxygen is given off. We see therefore that gases as well as water can\r\ndiffuse through the protoplasmic membrane of plants under certain\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Where Starch is Formed.\r\n\r\nWe have found by these simple experiments that some chemical change\r\ntakes place within the protoplasm of the green cells of plants during\r\nthe absorption of carbon dioxide and the giving off of oxygen. We\r\nshould examine some of the green parts of those plants used in the\r\nexperiments, or if they are not at hand we should set up others in\r\norder to make this examination.\r\n\r\n=135. Starch formed as a result of this process.=—We may take\r\nspirogyra which has been standing in water in the bright sunlight for\r\nseveral hours. A few of the threads should be placed in alcohol for a\r\nshort time to kill the protoplasm. From the alcohol we transfer the\r\nthreads to a solution of iodine in potassium iodide. We find that\r\nat certain points in the chlorophyll band a bluish tinge, or color,\r\nis imparted to the ring or sphere which surrounds the pyrenoid. In\r\nour first study of the spirogyra cell we noted this sphere as being\r\ncomposed of numerous small grains of starch which surround the pyrenoid.\r\n\r\n=136. Iodine used as a test for starch.=—This color reaction\r\nwhich we have obtained in treating the threads with iodine is the\r\nwell-known reaction, or test, for starch. We have demonstrated then\r\nthat starch is present in spirogyra threads which have stood in the\r\nsunlight with free access to carbon dioxide.\r\n\r\nIf we examine in the same way some threads which have stood in the\r\ndark for a few days we obtain no reaction for starch, or at best only\r\na slight reaction. This gives us some evidence that a chemical change\r\ndoes take place during this process (absorption of CO₂ and giving off\r\nof oxygen), and that starch is a product of that chemical change.\r\n\r\n=137. Schimper’s method of testing for the presence of starch.=—Another\r\nconvenient and quick method of testing for the presence of starch\r\nis what is known as Schimper’s method. A strong solution of chloral\r\nhydrate is made by taking 8 grams of chloral hydrate for every 5_cc_\r\nof water. To this solution is added a little of an alcoholic tincture\r\nof iodine. The threads of spirogyra may be placed directly in this\r\nsolution, and in a few moments mounted in water on the glass slip and\r\nexamined with the microscope. The reaction is strong and easily seen.\r\n\r\nWe should also examine the leaves of elodea, or one of the higher green\r\nplants which has been for some time in the sunlight. We may use here\r\nSchimper’s method by placing the leaves directly in the solution of\r\nchloral hydrate and iodine. The leaves are made transparent by the\r\nchloral hydrate so that the starch reaction from the iodine is easily\r\ndetected.\r\n\r\nThe following is a convenient and safe method of extracting chlorophyll\r\nfrom leaves. Fill a large pan, preferably a dishpan, half full of\r\nhot water. This may be kept hot by a small flame. On the water float\r\nan evaporating dish partly filled with alcohol. The leaves should be\r\nfirst immersed in the hot water for several minutes, then placed in the\r\nalcohol, which will quickly remove the chlorophyll. Now immerse the\r\nleaves in the iodine solution.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 68. Leaf of coleus showing green and white areas,\r\nbefore treatment with iodine.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 69. Similar leaf treated with iodine, the starch\r\nreaction only showing where the leaf was green.]\r\n\r\n=138. Green parts of plants form starch when exposed to light.=—Thus we\r\nfind that in the case of all the green plants we have examined, starch\r\nis present in the green cells of those which have been standing for\r\nsome time in the sunlight where the process of the absorption of CO₂\r\nand the giving off of oxygen can go on, and that in the case of plants\r\ngrown in the dark, or in leaves of plants which have stood for some\r\ntime in the dark, starch is absent. We reason from this that starch is\r\nthe product of the chemical change which takes place in the green cells\r\nunder these conditions. The CO₂ which is absorbed by the plant mixes\r\nwith the water (H₂O) in the cell and immediately forms carbonic acid.\r\nThe chlorophyll in the leaf absorbs radiant energy from the sun which\r\nsplits up the carbonic acid, and its elements then are put together\r\ninto a more complex compound, starch. This process of putting together\r\nthe elements of an organic compound is a _synthesis_, or a _synthetic\r\nassimilation_, since it is done by the living plant. It is therefore a\r\nsynthetic assimilation of carbon dioxide. Since the sunlight supplies\r\nthe energy it is also called _photosynthesis_, or _photosynthetic\r\nassimilation_. We can also say carbon dioxide assimilation, or CO₂\r\nassimilation (see paragraph on assimilation at close of Chapter 10).\r\n\r\n=139. Starch is formed only in the green parts of variegated\r\nleaves.=—If we test for starch in variegated leaves like the leaf\r\nof a coleus plant, we shall have an interesting demonstration of the\r\nfact that the green parts of plants only form starch. We may take\r\na leaf which is partly green and partly white, from a plant which\r\nhas been standing for some time in bright light. Fig. 68 is from a\r\nphotograph of such a leaf. We should first boil it in alcohol to remove\r\nthe green color. Now immerse it in the potassium iodide of iodine\r\nsolution for a short time. The parts which were formerly green are\r\nnow dark blue or nearly black, showing the presence of starch in\r\nthose portions of the leaf, while the white part of the leaf is still\r\nuncolored. This is well shown in fig. 69, which is from a photograph of\r\nanother coleus leaf treated with the iodine solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Chlorophyll and the Formation of Starch.\r\n\r\n=140.= In our experiments thus far in treating of the absorption\r\nof carbon dioxide and the evolution of oxygen, with the accompanying\r\nformation of starch, we have used green plants.\r\n\r\n=141. Fungi cannot form starch.=—If we should extend our\r\nexperiments to the fungi, which lack the green color so characteristic\r\nof the majority of plants, we should find that photosynthesis does not\r\ntake place even though the plants are exposed to direct sunlight. These\r\nplants cannot then form starch, but obtain carbohydrates for food from\r\nother sources.\r\n\r\n=142. Photosynthesis cannot take place in etiolated plants.=—Moreover\r\nphotosynthesis is usually confined to the green plants, and if by any\r\nmeans one of the ordinary green plants loses its green color this\r\nprocess cannot take place in that plant, even when brought into the\r\nsunlight, until the green color has appeared under the influence of\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nThis may be very easily demonstrated by growing seedlings of the\r\nbean, squash, corn, pea, etc. (pine seedlings are green even when\r\ngrown in the dark), in a dark room, or in a dark receiver of some\r\nkind which will shut out the rays of light. The room or receiver must\r\nbe quite dark. As the seedlings are “coming up,” and as long as they\r\nremain in the dark chamber, they will present some other color than\r\ngreen; usually they are somewhat yellowed. Such plants are said to be\r\n_etiolated_. If they are brought into the sunlight now for a few hours\r\nand then tested for the presence of starch the result will be negative.\r\nBut if the plant is left in the light, in a few days the leaves\r\nbegin to take on a green color, and then we find that carbon dioxide\r\nassimilation begins.\r\n\r\n=143. Chlorophyll and chloroplasts.=—The green substance in\r\nplants is then one of the important factors in this complicated\r\nprocess of forming starch. This green substance is _chlorophyll_,\r\nand it usually occurs in definite bodies, the chlorophyll bodies, or\r\n_chloroplasts_.\r\n\r\n      The material for new growth of plants grown in the\r\n    dark is derived from the seed. Plants grown in the dark\r\n    consist largely of water and protoplasm, the walls\r\n    being very thin.\r\n\r\n=144. Form of the chlorophyll bodies.=—Chlorophyll bodies vary in\r\nform in some different plants, especially in some of the lower\r\nplants. This we have already seen in the case of spirogyra, where the\r\nchlorophyll body is in the form of a very irregular band, which courses\r\naround the inner side of the cell wall in a spiral manner. In zygnema,\r\nwhich is related to spirogyra, the chlorophyll bodies are star-shaped.\r\nIn the desmids the form varies greatly. In œdogonium, another of the\r\nthread-like algæ, illustrated in fig. 144, the chlorophyll bodies\r\nare more or less flattened oval disks. In vaucheria, too, a branched\r\nthread-like alga shown in fig. 138, the chlorophyll bodies are oval in\r\noutline. These two plants, œdogonium and vaucheria, should be examined\r\nhere if possible, in order to become familiar with their form, since\r\nthey will be studied later under morphology (see chapters on œdogonium\r\nand vaucheria, for the occurrence and form of these plants). The form\r\nof the chlorophyll body found in œdogonium and vaucheria is that which\r\nis common to many of the green algæ, and also occurs in the mosses,\r\nliverworts, ferns, and the higher plants. It is a more or less rounded,\r\noval, flattened body.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 69_a_.\r\n\r\nSection of ivy leaf, palisade cells above, loose parenchyma, with large\r\nintercellular spaces in center. Epidermal cells on either edge, with no\r\nchlorophyll bodies.]\r\n\r\n=145. Chlorophyll is a pigment which resides in the chloroplast.=—That\r\nthe chlorophyll is a coloring substance which resides in the\r\nchloroplastid, and does not form the body itself, can be demonstrated\r\nby dissolving out the chlorophyll when the framework of the\r\nchloroplastid is apparent. The green parts of plants which have been\r\nplaced for some time in alcohol lose their green color. The alcohol\r\nat the same time becomes tinged with green. In sectioning such plant\r\ntissue we find that the chlorophyll bodies, or chloroplastids as they\r\nare more properly called, are still intact, though the green color is\r\nabsent. From this we know that chlorophyll is a substance distinct from\r\nthat of the chloroplastid.\r\n\r\n=146. Chlorophyll absorbs energy from sunlight for photosynthesis.=—It\r\nhas been found by analysis with the spectroscope that chlorophyll\r\nabsorbs certain of the rays of the sunlight. The energy which is thus\r\nobtained from the sun, called _kinetic_ energy, acts on the molecules\r\nof CH₂O₃, separating them into molecules of C, H, and O. (When the\r\nCO₂ from the air enters the plant cell it immediately unites with\r\nsome of the water, forming carbonic acid = CH₂O₃.) After a series of\r\ncomplicated chemical changes starch is formed by the union of carbon,\r\noxygen, and hydrogen. In this process of the reduction of the CH₂O₃ and\r\nthe formation of starch there is a surplus of oxygen, which accounts\r\nfor the giving off of oxygen during the process.\r\n\r\n=147. Rays of light concerned in photosynthesis.=—If a solution\r\nof chlorophyll be made, and light be passed through it, and this\r\nlight be examined with the spectroscope, there appear what are called\r\nabsorption bands. These are dark bands which lie across certain\r\nportions of the spectrum. These bands lie in the red, orange, yellow,\r\ngreen, blue, and violet, but the bands are stronger in the red, which\r\nshows that chlorophyll absorbs more of the red rays of light than of\r\nthe other rays. These are the rays of low refrangibility. The kinetic\r\nenergy derived by the absorption of these rays of light is transformed\r\ninto potential energy. That is, the molecule of CH₂O₃ is broken up, and\r\nthen by a different combination of certain elements starch is formed.[8]\r\n\r\n[8] In the formation of starch during photosynthesis the separated\r\nmolecules from the carbon dioxide and water unite in such a way that\r\ncarbon, hydrogen, and oxygen are united into a molecule of starch. This\r\nresult is usually represented by the following equation: CO₂ + H₂O =\r\nCH₂O + O₂. Then by polymerization 6(CH₂O) = C₆H₁₂O₆ = grape sugar.\r\nThen C₆H₁₂O₆-H₂O = C₆H₁₀O₅ = starch. It is believed, however, that the\r\nprocess is much more complicated than this, that several different\r\ncompounds are formed before starch finally appears, and that the\r\nformula for starch is much higher numerically than is represented by\r\nC₆H₁₀O₅.\r\n\r\n=148. Starch grains formed in the chloroplasts.=—During\r\nphotosynthesis the starch formed is deposited generally in small grains\r\nwithin the green chloroplast in the leaf. We can see this easily by\r\nexamining the leaves of some moss-like funaria which has been in the\r\nlight, or in the chloroplasts of the prothallia of ferns, etc. Starch\r\ngrains may also be formed in the chloroplasts from starch which was\r\nformed in some other part of the plant, but which has passed in\r\nsolution. Thus the functions of the chloroplast are twofold, that of\r\nphotosynthesis and the formation of starch grains.\r\n\r\n=149.= In the translocation of starch when it becomes stored up in\r\nvarious parts of the plant, it passes from the state of solution into\r\nstarch grains in connection with plastids similar to the chloroplasts,\r\nbut which are not green. The green ones are sometimes called\r\n_chloroplasts_, while the colorless ones are termed _leucoplasts_, and\r\nthose possessing other colors, as red and yellow, in floral leaves, the\r\nroot of the carrot, etc., are called _chromoplasts_.\r\n\r\n=150. Photosynthesis in other than green plants.=—While\r\ncarbohydrates are usually only formed by green plants, there are some\r\nexceptions. Apparent exceptions are found in the blue-green algæ, like\r\noscillatoria, nostoc, or in the brown and red sea weeds like fucus,\r\nrhabdonia, etc. These plants, however, possess chlorophyll, but it is\r\ndisguised by another pigment or color. There are plants, however, which\r\ndo not have chlorophyll and yet form carbohydrates with evolution of\r\noxygen in the presence of light, as for example a purple bacterium,\r\nin which the purple coloring substance absorbs light, though the rays\r\nabsorbed most energetically are not the red.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 70.\r\n\r\nCell exposed to weak diffused light showing chlorophyll bodies along\r\nthe horizontal walls.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 71.\r\n\r\nSame cell exposed to strong light, showing chlorophyll bodies have\r\nmoved to perpendicular walls.\r\n\r\nFigs. 70, 71.—Cell of prothallium of fern.]\r\n\r\n=151. Influence of light on the movement of chlorophyll\r\nbodies.=—_In fern prothallia_.—If we place fern prothallia in weak\r\nlight for a few hours, and then examine them under the microscope,\r\nwe find that the most of the chlorophyll bodies in the cells are\r\narranged along the inner surface of the horizontal wall. If now the\r\nsame prothallia are placed in a brightly lighted place for a short\r\ntime most of the chlorophyll bodies move so that they are arranged\r\nalong the surfaces of the perpendicular walls, and instead of having\r\nthe flattened surfaces exposed to the light as in the former case, the\r\nedges of the chlorophyll bodies are now turned toward the light. (See\r\nfigs. 70, 71.) The same phenomenon has been observed in many plants.\r\nLight then has an influence on chlorophyll bodies, to some extent\r\ndetermining their position. In weak light they are arranged so that the\r\nflattened surfaces are exposed to the incidence of the rays of light,\r\nso that the chlorophyll will absorb as great an amount as possible\r\nof kinetic energy; but intense light is stronger than necessary, and\r\nthe chlorophyll bodies move so that their edges are exposed to the\r\nincidence of the rays. This movement of the chlorophyll bodies is\r\ndifferent from that which takes place in some water plants like elodea.\r\nThe chlorophyll bodies in elodea are free in the protoplasm. The\r\nprotoplasm in the cells of elodea streams around the inside of the cell\r\nwall much as it does in nitella and the chlorophyll bodies are carried\r\nalong in the currents, while in nitella they are stationary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nSTARCH AND SUGAR CONCLUDED. ANALYSIS OF PLANT SUBSTANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Translocation of Starch.\r\n\r\n=152. Translocation of starch.=—It has been found that leaves of\r\nmany plants grown in the sunlight contain starch when examined after\r\nbeing in the sunlight for several hours. But when the plants are left\r\nin the dark for a day or two the leaves contain no starch, or a much\r\nsmaller amount. This suggests that starch after it has been formed may\r\nbe transferred from the leaves, or from those areas of the leaves where\r\nit has been formed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 72.\r\n\r\nLeaf of tropæolum with portion covered with corks to prevent the\r\nformation of starch. (After Detmer.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 73.\r\n\r\nLeaf of tropæolum treated with iodine after removal of cork, to show\r\nthat starch is removed from the leaf during the night.]\r\n\r\nTo test this let us perform an experiment which is often made. We may\r\ntake a plant such as a garden tropæolum or a clover plant, or other\r\nland plant in which it is easy to test for the presence of starch. Pin\r\na piece of circular cork, which is smaller than the area of the leaf,\r\non either side of the leaf, as in fig. 72, but allow free circulation\r\nof air between the cork and the under side of the leaf. Place the plant\r\nwhere it will be in the sunlight. On the afternoon of the following\r\nday, if the sun has been shining, test the entire leaf for starch. The\r\npart covered by the cork will not give the reaction for starch, as\r\nshown by the absence of the bluish color, while the other parts of the\r\nleaf will show it. The starch which was in that part of the leaf the\r\nday before was dissolved and removed during the night, and then during\r\nthe following day, the parts being covered from the light, no starch\r\nwas formed in them.\r\n\r\n=153. Starch in other parts of plants than the leaves.=—We may\r\nuse the iodine test to search for starch in other parts of plants than\r\nthe leaves. If we cut a potato tuber, scrape some of the cut surface\r\ninto a pulp, and apply the iodine test, we obtain a beautiful and\r\ndistinct reaction showing the presence of starch. Now we have learned\r\nthat starch is only formed in the parts containing chlorophyll. We\r\nhave also learned that the starch which has been formed in the leaves\r\ndisappears from the leaf or is transferred from the leaf. We judge\r\ntherefore that the starch which we have found in the tuber of the\r\npotato was formed first in the green leaves of the plant, as a result\r\nof photosynthesis. From the leaves it is transferred in solution to\r\nthe underground stems, and stored in the tubers. The starch is stored\r\nhere by the plant to provide food for the growth of new plants from the\r\ntubers, which are thus much more vigorous than the plants would be if\r\ngrown from the seed.\r\n\r\n=154. Form of starch grains.=—Where starch is stored as a reserve\r\nmaterial it occurs in grains which usually have certain characters\r\npeculiar to the species of plant in which they are found. They vary\r\nin size in many different plants, and to some extent in form also.\r\nIf we scrape some of the cut surface of the potato tuber into a pulp\r\nand mount a small quantity in water, or make a thin section for\r\nmicroscopic examination, we find large starch grains of a beautiful\r\nstructure. The grains are oval in form and more or less irregular in\r\noutline. But the striking peculiarity is the presence of what seem to\r\nbe alternating dark and light lines in the starch grain. We note that\r\nthe lines form irregular rings, which are smaller and smaller until\r\nwe come to the small central spot termed the “hilum” of the starch\r\ngrain. It is supposed that these apparent lines in the starch grain are\r\ncaused by the starch substance being deposited in alternating dense\r\nand dilute layers, the dilute layers containing more water than the\r\ndense ones; others think that the successive layers from the hilum\r\noutward are regularly of diminishing density, and that this gives the\r\nappearance of alternating lines. The starch formed by plants is one of\r\nthe organic substances which are manufactured by plants, and it (or\r\nglucose) is the basis for the formation of other organic substances in\r\nthe plant. Without such organic substances green plants cannot make any\r\nappreciable increase of plant substance, though a considerable increase\r\nin size of the plant may take place.\r\n\r\nNOTE.—The organic compounds resulting from photosynthesis,\r\nsince they are formed by the union of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen in\r\nsuch a way that the hydrogen and oxygen are usually present in the same\r\nproportion as in water, are called _carbohydrates_. The most common\r\ncarbohydrates are sugars (cane sugar, C₁₂H₂₂O₁₁ for example, in beet\r\nroots, sugar cane, sugar maple, etc.), starch, and cellulose.\r\n\r\n=155. Vaucheria.=—The result of carbon dioxide assimilation in\r\nthe threads of Vaucheria is not clearly understood. Starch is absent or\r\ndifficult to find in all except a few species, while oil globules are\r\npresent in most species. These oil globules are spherical, colorless,\r\nglobose and highly refringent. Often small ones are seen lying against\r\nchlorophyll bodies. Oil is a _hydrocarbon_ (containing C, H, and O, but\r\nthe H and O are in different proportions from what they are in H₂O)\r\nand until recently it was supposed that this oil in Vaucheria was the\r\ndirect result of photosynthesis. But the oil does not disappear when\r\nthe plant is kept for a long time in the dark, which seems to show\r\nthat it is not the direct product of carbon dioxide assimilation, and\r\nindicates that it comes either from a temporary starch body or from\r\nglucose. Schimper found glucose in several species of Vaucheria, and\r\nWaltz says that some starch is present in Vaucheria sericea, while\r\nin V. tuberosa starch is abundant and replaces the oil. To test for\r\noil bodies in Vaucheria treat the threads with weak osmic acid, or\r\nallow them to stand for twenty-four hours in Fleming’s solution (which\r\ncontains osmic acid). Mount some threads and examine with microscope.\r\nThe oil globules are stained black.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Sugar, and Digestion of Starch.[9]\r\n\r\n=156.= It is probable that some form of sugar is always produced\r\nas the result of photosynthesis. The sugar thus formed may be stored as\r\nsuch or changed to starch. In general it may be said that sugar is most\r\ncommon in the green parts of monocotyledonous plants, while starch is\r\nmost frequent in dicotyledons. Plant sugars are of three general kinds:\r\ncane sugar abundant in the sugar cane, sugar beet, sugar maple, etc.;\r\nglucose and fruit sugar, found in the fruits of a majority of plants,\r\nand abundant in some, as in apples, pears, grapes, etc.; and maltose, a\r\nvariety produced in germinating seeds, as in malted barley.\r\n\r\n=157. Test for sugar.=—A very pretty experiment maybe made by taking\r\ntwo test tubes, placing in one a solution of commercial grape sugar\r\n(glucose), in the other one of granulated cane sugar, and adding to\r\neach a few drops of Fehling’s solution.[10] After these tubes have\r\nstood in a warm place for half an hour, it will be found that a bright\r\norange brown or cinnabar-colored precipitate of copper and cuprous\r\noxide has formed in the tube containing grape sugar, while the other\r\nsolution is unchanged. Grape sugar or glucose, therefore, reduces\r\nFehling’s solution, while cane sugar as such has no effect upon it.\r\n\r\nCane sugar may be changed or converted to glucose by being boiled for a\r\nshort time with a dilute acid, or by adding Fehling’s solution to the\r\nsugar solution and boiling. In the latter case the change is brought\r\nabout by the alkali and the precipitate of copper and cuprous oxide\r\nforms.\r\n\r\n=158. Tests for sugar in plant tissue.=—(_a_) Scrape out a little\r\nof the tissue from the inside of a ripe apple or pear, place it with a\r\nlittle water in a test tube, and add a few drops of Fehling’s solution.\r\nAfter standing half an hour the characteristic precipitate of copper\r\nand cuprous oxide appears, showing that grape sugar is present in\r\nquantity.\r\n\r\nMake thin sections of the apple and mount in a drop of Fehling’s\r\nsolution on a slide. After half an hour examine with the microscope.\r\nThe granules of cuprous oxide are present in the cells of the tissue in\r\ngreat abundance.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Cut up several leaves of a young vigorous corn seedling,\r\ncover with water in a test tube and boil for a minute. After the\r\ndecoction has cooled add the Fehling’s solution and allow to stand.\r\nThe precipitate will appear. For comparison take similar corn leaves,\r\nremove the chlorophyll with alcohol and test with iodine. No starch\r\nreaction appears. The carbohydrate in corn leaves is therefore glucose\r\nand not starch. If now the corn seed be examined the cells will be\r\nfound to be full of starch grains which give the beautiful blue\r\nreaction with iodine. This experiment shows that grape sugar is formed\r\nin the leaves of the corn plant, but is changed to starch when stored\r\nin the seed.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Take two leaves of bean seedling or coleus, test one for sugar\r\nand the other for starch. Both are present.\r\n\r\n(_d_) Procure some maple sap in the spring, or in the winter months\r\nmake a decoction of the broken tips of young branches of the sugar\r\nmaple by boiling them in water in a test tube. To the sap or cool\r\ndecoction add Fehling’s solution. No precipitate appears after\r\nstanding. Now heat the same solution to the boiling point, and the\r\nprecipitate forms, showing the presence of cane sugar in the maple\r\nsap which was converted to glucose and fruit sugar by boiling in the\r\npresence of an alkali.\r\n\r\n(_e_) Scrape out some of the tissue from a sugar beet root, cover with\r\nwater in a test tube and add Fehling’s solution. No change takes place\r\nafter standing. Boil the same solution and the precipitate forms,\r\nshowing the presence of cane sugar, inverted to grape sugar and fruit\r\nsugar by the hot alkali.\r\n\r\n=159. How starch is changed to sugar.=—We have seen that in\r\nmany plants the carbohydrate formed as the result of carbon dioxide\r\nassimilation is stored as starch. This substance being insoluble\r\nin water must be changed to sugar, which is soluble before it can\r\nbe used as food or transported to other parts of the plant. This\r\nis accomplished through the action of certain enzymes, principally\r\ndiastase. This substance has the power of acting upon starch under\r\nproper conditions of temperature and moisture, causing it to take up\r\nthe elements of water, and so to become sugar.\r\n\r\nThis process takes place commonly in the leaves where starch is formed,\r\nbut especially in seeds, tubers (during the sprouting, etc.), and\r\nother parts which the plant uses as storehouses for starch food. It is\r\nprobable that the same conditions of temperature and moisture which\r\nfavor germination or active growth are also favorable to the production\r\nof diastase.\r\n\r\n=160. Experiments to show the action of diastase.=—(_a_) Place\r\na bit of starch half as large as a pea in a test tube, and cover with\r\na weak solution[11] (about ⅕ per cent) of commercial taka diastase.\r\nAfter it has stood in a warm place for five or ten minutes test with\r\nFehling’s solution. The precipitate of cuprous oxide appears showing\r\nthat some of the starch has been changed to sugar. By using measured\r\nquantities, and by testing with iodine at frequent intervals, it can\r\nbe determined just how long it takes a given quantity of diastase to\r\nchange a known quantity of starch. In this connection one should first\r\ntest a portion of the same starch with Fehling’s solution to show that\r\nno sugar is present.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Repeat the above experiment using a little tissue from a potato,\r\nand some from a corn seed.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Take 25 germinating barley seeds in which the radicle is just\r\nappearing. Grind up thoroughly in a mortar with about three parts of\r\nwater. After this has stood for ten or fifteen minutes, filter. Fill a\r\ntest tube one-third full of water, add a piece of starch half the size\r\nof a pea or less, and boil the mixture to make starch-paste. Add the\r\nbarley extract. Put in a warm place and test from time to time with\r\niodine. The first samples so treated will be blue, later ones violet,\r\nbrown, and finally colorless, showing that the starch has all\r\ndisappeared. This is due to the action of the diastase which was\r\npresent in the germinating seeds, and which was dissolved out and added\r\nto the starch mixture. The office of this diastase is to change the\r\nstarch in the seeds to sugar. Germinating wheat is sweet, and it is a\r\nmatter of common observation that bread made from sprouted wheat is\r\nsweet.\r\n\r\n(_d_) Put a little starch-paste in a test tube and cover it with saliva\r\nfrom the mouth. After ten or fifteen minutes test with Fehling’s\r\nsolution. A strong reaction appears showing how quickly and effectively\r\nsaliva acts in converting starch to sugar. Successive tests with iodine\r\nwill show the gradual disappearance of the starch.\r\n\r\n=161. These experiments have shown us that diastase= from three\r\ndifferent sources can act upon starch converting it into sugar. The\r\nactive principle in the saliva is an _animal_ diastase (_ptyalin_),\r\nwhich is necessary as one step in the digestion of starch food in\r\nanimals. The _taka_ diastase is derived from a fungus (Eurotium oryzæ)\r\nwhich feeds on the starch in rice grains converting it into sugar\r\nwhich the fungus absorbs for food. The _malt_ diastase and _leaf_\r\ndiastase are formed by the seed plants. That in seeds converts the\r\nstarch to sugar which is absorbed by the embryo for food. That in the\r\nleaf converts the starch into sugar so that it can be transported to\r\nother parts of the plant to be used in building new tissue, or to be\r\nstored again in the form of starch (example, the potato, in seeds,\r\netc.). The starch is formed in the leaf during the daylight. The light\r\nrenders the leaf diastase inactive. But at night the leaf diastase\r\nbecomes active and converts the starch made during the day. Starch is\r\nnot soluble in water, while the sugar is, and the sugar in solution is\r\nthus easily transported throughout the plant. In those green plants\r\nwhich do not form starch in their leaves (sugar beet, corn, and many\r\nmonocotyledons), grape sugar and fruit sugar are formed in the green\r\nparts as the result of photosynthesis. In some, like the corn, the\r\ngrape sugar formed in the leaves is transported to other parts of the\r\nplant, and some of it is stored up in the seed as starch. In others\r\nlike the sugar beet the glucose and fruit sugar formed in the leaves\r\nflow to other parts of the plant, and much of it is stored up as cane\r\nsugar in the beet root. The process of photosynthesis probably proceeds\r\nin the same way in all cases up to the formation of the grape sugar and\r\nfruit sugar in the leaves. In the beet, corn, etc., the process stops\r\nhere, while in the bean, clover, and most dicotyledons the process is\r\ncarried one step farther in the leaf and starch is formed.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Rough Analysis of Plant Substance.\r\n\r\n=162. Some simple experiments to indicate the nature of plant\r\nsubstance.=—After these building-up processes of the plant, it is\r\ninstructive to perform some simple experiments which indicate roughly\r\nthe nature of the plant substance, and serve to show how it can be\r\nseparated into other substances, some of them being reduced to the\r\nform in which they existed when the plant took them as food. For exact\r\nexperiments and results it would be necessary to make chemical analyses.\r\n\r\n=163. The water in the plant.=—Take fresh leaves or leafy shoots\r\nor other fresh plant parts. Weigh. Permit them to remain in a dry room\r\nuntil they are what we call “dry.” Now weigh. The plants have lost\r\nweight, and from what we have learned in studies of transpiration this\r\nloss in weight we know to result from the loss of water from the plant.\r\n\r\n=164. The dry plant material contains water.=—Take air-dry\r\nleaves, shavings, or other dry parts of plants. Place them in a test\r\ntube. With a holder rest the tube in a nearly horizontal position,\r\nwith the bottom of the tube in the flame of a Bunsen burner. Very\r\nsoon, before the plant parts begin to “burn,” note that moisture is\r\naccumulating on the inner surface of the test tube. This is water\r\ndriven off which could not escape by drying in air, without the\r\naddition of artificial heat, and is called “hygroscopic water.”\r\n\r\n=165. Water formed on burning the dry plant material.=—Light a\r\nsoft-pine or basswood splinter. Hold a thistle tube in one hand with the\r\nbulb downward and above the flame of the splinter. Carbon will be\r\ndeposited over the inner surface of the bulb. After a time hold the\r\ntube toward the window and look through it above the carbon. Drops of\r\nwater have accumulated on the inside of the tube. This water is formed\r\nby the rearrangement of some of the hydrogen and oxygen, which is set\r\nfree by the burning of the plant material, where they were combined\r\nwith carbon, as in the cellulose, and with other elements.\r\n\r\n=166. Formation of charcoal by burning.=—Take dried leaves, and\r\nshavings from some soft wood. Place in a porcelain crucible, and cover\r\nabout 3 cm. deep with dry fine earth. Place the crucible in the flame\r\nof a Bunsen burner and let it remain for about fifteen minutes. Remove\r\nand empty the contents. If the flame was hot the plant material will be\r\nreduced to a good quality of charcoal. The charcoal consists largely of\r\ncarbon.\r\n\r\n=167. The ash of the plant.=—Place in the porcelain crucible\r\ndried leaves and shavings as before. Do not cover with earth. Place the\r\ncrucible in the flame of the Bunsen burner, and for a moment place on\r\nthe porcelain cover; then remove the cover, and note the moisture on\r\nthe under surface from the escaping water. Permit the plant material to\r\nburn; it may even flame for a time. In the course of fifteen minutes it\r\nis reduced to a whitish powder, much smaller in bulk than the charcoal\r\nin the former experiment. This is the ash of the plant.\r\n\r\n=168. What has become of the carbon?=—In this experiment the air\r\nwas not excluded from the plant material, so that oxygen combined with\r\ncarbon as the water was freed, and formed carbon dioxide, passing off\r\ninto the air in this form. This it will be remembered is the form in\r\nwhich the plant took the carbon-food in through the leaves. Here the\r\ncarbon dioxide met the water coming from the soil, and the two united\r\nto form, ultimately, starch, cellulose, and other compounds of carbon;\r\nwhile with the addition of nitrogen, sulphur, etc., coming also from\r\nthe soil, still other plant substances were formed.\r\n\r\n=169.= The carbohydrates are classed among the non-nitrogenous\r\nsubstances. Other non-nitrogenous plant substances are the organic\r\nacids like oxalic acid (H₂C₂O₄), malic acid (H₂C₄H₄O₅), etc.; the fats\r\nand fixed oils, which occur in the seeds and fruits of many plants. Of\r\nthe nitrogenous substances the proteids have a very complex chemical\r\nformula and contain carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur, etc.\r\n(example, _aleuron_, or proteid grains, found in seeds). The proteids\r\nare the source of nitrogenous food for the seedling during germination.\r\nOf the amides, _asparagin_ (C₄H₈N₂O₃) is an example of a nitrogenous\r\nsubstance; and of the alkaloids, nicotin (C₁₀H₁₄N₂) from tobacco.\r\n\r\nAll living plants contain a large per cent of water. According to\r\nVines “ripe seeds dried in the air contain 12 to 15 per cent of water,\r\nherbaceous plants 60 to 80 per cent, and many water plants and fungi as\r\nmuch as 95 per cent of their weight.” When heated to 100° C. the water\r\nis driven off. The dry matter remaining is made up partly of organic\r\ncompounds, examples of which are given above, and inorganic compounds.\r\nBy burning this dry residue the organic substances are mostly changed\r\ninto volatile products, principally carbonic acid, water, and nitrogen.\r\nThe inorganic substances as a result of combustion remain as a white or\r\ngray powder, the _ash_.\r\n\r\nThe amount of the ash increases with the age of the plant, though the\r\npercentage of ash may vary at different times in the different members\r\nof the plant. The following table taken from Vines will give an idea of\r\nthe amount and composition of the ash in the dry solid of a few plants:\r\n\r\n                      CONTENT OF 1000 PARTS OF DRY SOLID MATTER.\r\n\r\n                     |Clover, in|Wheat,|Wheat,|Potato|Apples|  Peas\r\n                     | blossom  |grain |straw |tubers|      |(the seed)\r\n   ------------------+----------+------+------+------+------+----------\r\n    Ash.             |  68.3    | 19.7 | 53.7 | 37.7 | 14.4 |  27.3\r\n    Potash.          |  21.96   | 6.14 | 7.33 | 22.76|  5.14|  11.41\r\n    Soda.            |   1.39   | 0.44 | 0.74 |  0.99|  3.76|   0.26\r\n    Lime.            |  24.06   | 0.66 | 3.09 |  0.97|  0.59|   1.36\r\n    Magnesium.       |   7.44   | 2.36 | 1.33 |  1.77|  1.26|   2.17\r\n    Ferric Oxide.    |   0.72   | 0.26 | 0.33 |  0.45|  0.2 |   0.16\r\n    Phosphoric Acid. |   6.74   | 9.26 | 2.58 |  6.53|  1.96|   9.95\r\n    Sulphuric Acid.  |   2.06   | 0.07 | 1.32 |  2.45|  0.88|   0.95\r\n    Silica.          |   1.62   | 0.42 |36.25 |  0.8 |  0.62|   0.24\r\n    Chlorine.        |   2.66   | 0.04 |  0.9 |  1.17|  ....|   0.42\r\n   ------------------+----------+------+------+------+------+----------\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[9] Paragraphs 156-160 were prepared by Dr. E.

The necessary constituents of plant food.=—As indicated in\r\nChapter 3, investigation has taught us the principal constituents of\r\nplant food. Some suggestion as to the food substances is derived by a\r\nchemical analysis of various plants. In Chapter 8 it was noted that\r\nthere are two principal kinds of compounds in plant substances, the\r\norganic compounds and the inorganic compounds or mineral substances.\r\nThe principal elements in the organic compounds are _hydrogen_,\r\n_carbon_, _oxygen_ and _nitrogen_. The elements in the inorganic\r\ncompounds which have been found indispensable to plant growth are\r\n_calcium_,[12] _potassium_, _magnesium_, _phosphorus_, _sulphur_ and\r\n_iron_. (See paragraphs 54-58, and complete observations on water\r\ncultures.) Other elements are found in the ash of plants; and while\r\nthey are not absolutely necessary for growth, some[13] of them are\r\nbeneficial in one way or another.\r\n\r\n=171.= The carbohydrates are derived, as we have learned, from\r\nthe CO₂ of the air, and water in the plant tissue drawn from the soil;\r\nthough in the case of aquatic plants entirely submerged, all the\r\nconstituents are absorbed from the surrounding water.\r\n\r\n=172. Food substances in the soil.=—Land plants derive their\r\nmineral food from the soil, the soil received the mineral substances\r\nfrom dissolving and disintegrating rocks. Nitrogenous food is chiefly\r\nderived from the same source, but under a variety of conditions which\r\nwill be discussed in later paragraphs, but the nitrogen comes primarily\r\nfrom the air. Some of the mineral substances, those which are soluble\r\nas well as some of the nitrogenous substances, are found in solution in\r\nthe soil. These are absorbed by the plant, as needed, along with water,\r\nthrough the root hairs.\r\n\r\n=173. Absorption of soluble substances.=—Since these substances\r\nare dissolved in the water of the soil, it is not necessary for us\r\nto dwell on the process of absorption. This in general is dwelt upon\r\nin Chapter 3. It should be noted, however, that food substances in\r\nsolution, during absorption, diffuse through the protoplasmic membrane\r\nindependently of each other and also independently of the rate of\r\nmovement of the water from the soil into the root hairs and cells of\r\nthe root.\r\n\r\nWhen the cells have absorbed a certain amount of a given substance,\r\nno more is absorbed until the concentration of the cell-sap in that\r\nparticular substance is reduced. This, however, does not interfere\r\nwith the absorption of water, or of other substances in solution by\r\nthe same cells. Plants have therefore a certain selective power in the\r\nabsorption of food substances.\r\n\r\n=174. Action of root hairs on insoluble substances. Acidity of root\r\nhairs.=—If we take a seedling which has been grown in a germinator,\r\nor in the folds of cloths or paper, so that the roots are free from the\r\nsoil, and touch the moist root hairs to blue litmus paper, the paper\r\nbecomes red in color where the root hairs have come in contact. This\r\nis the reaction for the presence of an acid salt, and indicates that\r\nthe root hairs excrete certain acid substances. This acid property of\r\nthe root hairs serves a very important function in the preparation\r\nof certain of the elements of plant food in the soil. Certain of the\r\nchemical compounds of potash, phosphoric acid, etc., become deposited\r\non the soil particles, and are not soluble in water. The acid of the\r\nroot hairs dissolves some of these compounds where the particles of\r\nsoil are in close contact with them, and the solutions can then be\r\ntaken up by the roots. Carbonic acid and other acids are also formed in\r\nthe soil, and aid in bringing these substances into solution.\r\n\r\n=175.= This corrosive action of the roots can be shown by the\r\nwell-known experiment of growing a plant on a marble plate which is\r\ncovered by soil. In lieu of the marble plate, the peas may be planted\r\nin clam or oyster shells, which are then buried in the soil of the\r\npot, so that the roots of the seedlings will come in contact with the\r\nsmooth surface of the shell. After a few weeks, if the soil be washed\r\nfrom the marble where the roots have been in close contact, there will\r\nbe an outline of this part of the root system. Several different acid\r\nsubstances are excreted from the roots of plants which have been found\r\nto redden blue litmus paper by contact. Experiments by Czapek show,\r\nhowever, that the carbonic acid excreted by the roots has the power of\r\ndirectly bringing about these corrosion phenomena. The acid salts are\r\nthe substances which are most actively concerned in reddening the blue\r\nlitmus paper. They do not directly aid in the corrosion phenomena. In\r\nthe soil, however, where these compounds of potash, phosphoric acid,\r\netc., are which are not soluble in water, the acid salt (primary acid\r\npotassium phosphate) which is most actively concerned in reddening\r\nthe blue litmus paper may act indirectly on these mineral substances,\r\nmaking them available for plant food. This salt soon unites with\r\ncertain chlorides in the soil, making among other things small\r\nquantities of hydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\n=176.= NOTE.—It is a general rule that plants cannot\r\ntake solid food into their bodies, but obtain all food in either a\r\nliquid or gaseous state. The only exception to this is in the case of\r\nthe plasmodia of certain _Myxomycetes_ (Slime Moulds), and also perhaps\r\nsome of the Flagellates and other very low forms, which engulf solid\r\nparticles of food. It is uncertain, however, whether these organisms\r\nbelong to the plant or animal kingdom, and they probably occupy a more\r\nor less intermediate position.\r\n\r\n=177. Action of nitrite and nitrate bacteria.=—Many of the\r\nhigher green plants prefer their nitrogenous food in the form of\r\nnitrates. (Example, nitrate of soda, potassium nitrate, saltpetre.)\r\nNitrates are constantly being formed in soil by the action of certain\r\nbacteria. The nitrite bacteria (Nitromonas) convert ammonia in the\r\nsoil to _nitrous acid_ (a _nitrite_), while at this point the nitrate\r\nbacteria (Nitrobacter) convert the nitrites into nitrates. The fact\r\nthat this nitrification is going on constantly in soil is of the utmost\r\nimportance, for while commercial nitrates are often applied to the\r\nsoil, the nitrates are easily washed from the soil by heavy rains.\r\nThese nitrite and nitrate bacteria require oxygen for their activity,\r\nand they are able to obtain their carbohydrates by decomposing organic\r\nmatter in the soil, or directly by assimilating the CO₂ in the soil,\r\nderiving the energy for the assimilation of the carbon dioxide from\r\nthe chemical process of nitrification. This kind of carbon dioxide\r\nassimilation is called _chemosynthetic_ assimilation.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Parasites and Saprophytes.\r\n\r\n=178. Parasites among the fungi.=—A parasite is an organism\r\nwhich derives all or a part of its food directly from another living\r\norganism (its host) and at the latter’s expense. The larger number\r\nof plant parasites are found among the fungi (rusts, smuts, mildews,\r\netc.). (See Nutrition of the Fungi, paragraph 185.) Some of these are\r\nnot capable of development unless upon their host, and are called\r\n_obligate_ parasites. Others can grow not only as parasites but at\r\nother times can also grow on dead organic matter, and are called\r\n_facultative_ parasites, i.e. they can choose either a parasitic life\r\nor a saprophytic one.\r\n\r\n=179. Parasites among the seed plants.=—_Cuscuta._—There are,\r\nhowever, parasites among the seed plants; for example, the dodder\r\n(Cuscuta), parasitic on clover, and a great variety of other plants.\r\nThere is food enough in the seed for the young plant to take root and\r\ndevelop a slender stem until it takes hold of its host. It then twines\r\naround the stem of its host sending wedge-shaped haustoria into the\r\nstem to obtain food. The part then in connection with the ground dies.\r\n\r\nThe haustoria of the dodder form a complete junction with the vascular\r\nbundles of its host so that through the vessels water and salts are\r\nobtained, while through the junction of sieve tubes the elaborated\r\norganic food is obtained. The union of the dodder with its host is like\r\nthat between a graft and the graft stock. The beech drops (Epiphegus)\r\nis another example of a parasitic seed plant. It is parasitic on the\r\nroots of the beech.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 74. Dodder.]\r\n\r\n=180. The mistletoe= (Viscum album), which grows on the branches\r\nof trees, sends its roots into the branches, and only the vessels\r\nof the vascular system are fused according to some. If this is true\r\nthen it probably obtains only water and salts from its host. But the\r\nmistletoe has green leaves and is thus able to assimilate carbon\r\ndioxide and manufacture its own organic substances. It is claimed by\r\nsome, however, that the host derives some food from the parasite during\r\nthe winter when the host has shed its leaves, and if this is true it\r\nwould seem that organic food could also be derived during the summer\r\nfrom the host by the mistletoe.\r\n\r\n=181. Saprophytes.=—A saprophyte is a plant which is enabled\r\nto obtain its food, especially its organic food, directly from dead\r\nanimals or plants or from dead organic substances. Many fungi are\r\nsaprophytes, as the moulds, mushrooms, etc. (See Nutrition of the\r\nFungi.)\r\n\r\n=182. Humus saprophytes.=—The action of fungi as described in the\r\npreceding chapter, as well as of certain bacteria, gradually converts\r\nthe dead plants or plant parts into the finely powdered brown substance\r\nknown as _humus_. In general the green plants cannot absorb organic\r\nfood from humus directly. But plants which are devoid of chlorophyll\r\ncan live saprophytically on this humus. They are known as _humus\r\nsaprophytes_. Many of the mushrooms and other fungi, as well as some\r\nseed plants which lack chlorophyll or possess only a small quantity,\r\nare able to absorb all their organic food from humus. It is uncertain\r\nwhether any seed plants can obtain all of their organic food directly\r\nfrom humus, though it is believed that many can so obtain a portion\r\nof it. But a number of seed plants, like the Indian-pipe (Monotropa)\r\nand certain orchids, obtain organic food from humus. These plants lack\r\nchlorophyll and cannot therefore manufacture their own carbohydrate\r\nfood. Not being parasitic on plants which can, as in the case of the\r\ndodder and beech drops mentioned above, they undoubtedly derive their\r\norganic food from the humus. But fungus mycelium growing in the humus\r\nis attached to their roots, and in some orchids enters the roots and\r\nforms a nutritive connection. The fungus mycelium can absorb organic\r\nfood from the humus and in some cases at least can transfer it over to\r\nthe roots of the higher plant (see Mycorhiza).\r\n\r\n=183. Autotrophic, heterotrophic, and mixotrophic plants.=—An\r\n_autotrophic_ plant is one which is self-nourishing, i.e. it is\r\nprovided with an abundant chlorophyll apparatus for carbon dioxide\r\nassimilation and with absorbing organs for obtaining water and salts.\r\nHeterotrophic plants are not provided with a chlorophyll apparatus\r\nsufficient to assimilate all the carbon dioxide necessary, so they\r\nnourish themselves by other means. _Mixotrophic_ plants are those\r\nwhich are intermediate between the other two, i.e. they have some\r\nchlorophyll but not enough to provide all the organic food necessary,\r\nso they obtain a portion of it by other means. Evidently there are all\r\ngradations of mixotrophic plants between the two other kinds (example,\r\nthe mistletoe).\r\n\r\n=184. Symbiosis.=—Symbiosis means a living with or living\r\ntogether, and is said of those organisms which live so closely in\r\nconnection with each other as to be influenced for better or worse,\r\nespecially from a nutrition standpoint. _Conjunctive_ symbiosis has\r\nreference to those cases where there is a direct interchange of\r\nfood material between the two organisms (lichens, mycorhiza, etc.).\r\n_Disjunctive_ symbiosis has reference to an inter-life relation without\r\nany fixed union between them (example, the relations between flowers\r\nand insects, ants and plants, and even in a broad sense the relation\r\nbetween saprophytic plants in reducing organic matter to a condition\r\nin which it may be used for food by the green plants, and these in\r\nturn provide organic matter for the saprophytes to feed upon, etc.).\r\n_Antagonistic_ symbiosis is shown in the relation of parasite to its\r\nhost, _reciprocal_ symbiosis, or _mutualistic_ symbiosis is shown in\r\nthose cases where both symbionts derive food as a result of the union\r\n(lichens, mycorhiza, etc.).\r\n\r\n\r\n3. How Fungi Obtain their Food.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 75. Carnation rust on leaf and flower stem. From\r\nphotograph.]\r\n\r\n=185. Nutrition of moulds.=—In our study of mucor, as we have\r\nseen, the growing or vegetative part of the plant, the mycelium, lies\r\nwithin the substratum, which contains the food materials in solution,\r\nand the slender threads are thus bathed on all sides by them. The\r\nmycelium absorbs the watery solutions throughout the entire system of\r\nramifications. When the upright fruiting threads are developed they\r\nderive the materials for their growth directly from the mycelium with\r\nwhich they are in connection. The moulds which grow on decaying fruit\r\nor on other organic matter derive their nutrient materials in the same\r\nway. The portion of the mould which we usually see on the surface of\r\nthese substances is in general the fruiting part. The larger part of\r\nthe mycelium lies hidden within the substratum.\r\n\r\n=186. Nutrition of parasitic fungi.=—Certain of the fungi grow on\r\nor within the higher plants and derive their food materials from them\r\nand at their expense. Such a fungus is called a _parasite_, and there\r\nare a large number of these plants which are known as _parasitic\r\nfungi_. The plant at whose expense they grow is called the “_host_.”\r\n\r\nOne of these parasitic fungi, which it is quite easy to obtain in\r\ngreenhouses or conservatories during the autumn and winter, is the\r\ncarnation rust (_Uromyces caryophyllinus_), since it breaks out in\r\nrusty dark brown patches on the leaves and stems of the carnation (see\r\nfig. 75). If we make thin cross-sections through one of these spots\r\non a leaf, and place them for a few minutes in a solution of chloral\r\nhydrate, portions of the tissues of the leaf will be dissolved. After\r\na few minutes we wash the sections in water on a glass slip, and stain\r\nthem with a solution of eosin. If the sections were carefully made, and\r\nthin, the threads of the mycelium will be seen coursing between the\r\ncells of the leaf as slender threads. Here and there will be seen short\r\nbranches of these threads which penetrate the cell wall of the host and\r\nproject into the interior of the cell in the form of an irregular knob.\r\nSuch a branch is a _haustorium_. By means of this haustorium, which is\r\nhere only a short branch of the mycelium, nutritive substances are\r\ntaken by the fungus from the protoplasm or cell-sap of the carnation.\r\nFrom here it passes to the threads of the mycelium. These in turn\r\nsupply food material for the development of the dark brown gonidia,\r\nwhich we see form the dark-looking powder on the spots. Many other\r\nfungi form haustoria, which take up nutrient matters in the way\r\ndescribed for the carnation rust. In the case of other parasitic fungi\r\nthe threads of the mycelium themselves penetrate the cells of the host,\r\nwhile in still others the mycelium courses only between the cells of\r\nthe host (fungus of peach leaf curl for example) and derives food\r\nmaterials from the protoplasm or cell-sap of the host by the process of\r\nosmosis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 76. Several teleutospores, showing the variations\r\nin form.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 77. Cells from the stem of a rusted carnation,\r\nshowing the intercellular mycelium and haustoria. Object magnified 30\r\ntimes more than the scale.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 78. Cell from carnation leaf, showing haustorium of\r\nrust mycelium grasping the nucleus of the host. _h_, haustorium; _n_,\r\nnucleus of host.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 79. Intercellular mycelium with haustoria entering\r\nthe cells. _A_, of Cystopus candidus (white rust); _B_, of Peronospora\r\ncalotheca. (De Bary.)]\r\n\r\n=187. Nutrition of the larger fungi.=—If we select some one of\r\nthe larger fungi, the majority of which belong to the mushroom family\r\nand its relatives, which is growing on a decaying log or in the soil,\r\nwe shall see on tearing open the log, or on removing the bark or part\r\nof the soil, as the case may be, that the stem of the plant, if it have\r\none, is connected with whitish strands. During the spring, summer, or\r\nautumn months, examples of the mushrooms connected with these strands\r\nmay usually be found readily in the fields or woods, but during the\r\nwinter and colder parts of the year often they may be seen in forcing\r\nhouses, especially those cellars devoted to the propagation of the\r\nmushroom of commerce.\r\n\r\n=188.= These strands are made up of numerous threads of the\r\nmycelium which are closely twisted and interwoven into a cord or\r\nstrand, which is called a mycelium strand, or _rhizomorph_. These are\r\nwell shown in fig. 236, which is from a photograph of the mycelium\r\nstrands, or “spawn” as the grower of mushrooms calls it, of Agaricus\r\ncampestris. The little knobs or enlargements on the strands are the\r\nyoung fruit bodies, or “buttons.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 80. Sterile mycelium on wood props in coal mine, 400\r\nfeet below surface.\r\n\r\n(Photographed by the author.)]\r\n\r\n=189.= While these threads or strands of the mycelium in the\r\ndecaying wood or in the decaying organic matter of the soil are not\r\ntrue roots, they function as roots, or root hairs, in the absorption\r\nof food materials. In old cellars and on damp soil in moist places we\r\nsometimes see fine examples of this vegetative part of the fungi, the\r\nmycelium. But most magnificent examples are to be seen in abandoned\r\nmines where timber has been taken down into the tunnels far below\r\nthe surface of the ground to support the rock roof above the mining\r\noperations. I have visited some of the coal mines at Wilkesbarre, Pa.,\r\nand here on the wood props and doors, several hundred feet below the\r\nsurface, and in blackest darkness, in an atmosphere almost completely\r\nsaturated at all times, the mycelium of some of the wood destroying\r\nfungi grows in a profusion and magnificence which is almost beyond\r\nbelief. Fig. 80 is from a flash-light photograph of a beautiful example\r\n400 feet below the surface of the ground. This was growing over the\r\nsurface of a wood prop or post, and the picture is much reduced. On\r\nthe doors in the mine one can see the strands of the mycelium which\r\nradiate in fan-like figures at certain places near the margin of\r\ngrowth, and farther back the delicate tassels of mycelium which hang\r\ndown in fantastic figures, all in spotless white and rivalling the most\r\nbeautiful fabric in the exquisiteness of its construction.\r\n\r\n=190. How fungi derive carbohydrate food.=—The fungi being\r\ndevoid of chlorophyll cannot assimilate the CO₂ from the air. They\r\nare therefore dependent on the green plants for their carbohydrate\r\nfood. Among the saprophytes, the leaf and wood destroying fungi\r\nexcrete certain substances (known as _enzymes_) which dissolve the\r\ncarbohydrates and certain other organic compounds in the woody or\r\nleafy substratum in which they grow. They thus produce a sort of\r\nextracellular digestion of carbohydrates, converting them into a\r\nsoluble form which can be absorbed by the mycelium. The parasitic\r\nfungi also obtain their carbohydrates and other organic food from the\r\nhost. The mycelium of certain parasitic, and of wood destroying fungi,\r\nexcretes enzymes (_cytase_) which dissolve minute perforations in the\r\ncell walls of the host and thus aid the hypha during its boring action\r\nin penetrating cell walls.\r\n\r\nNOTE.—Certain wood destroying fungi growing in oaks absorb\r\ntannin directly, i.e. in an unchanged form. One of the pine destroying\r\nfungi (_Trametes pini_) absorbs the xylogen from the wood cells,\r\nleaving the pure cellulose in which the xylogen was filtrated; while\r\n_Polyporus mollis_ absorbs the cellulose, leaving behind only the wood\r\nelement.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Mycorhiza.\r\n\r\n=191.= While such plants as the Indian-pipe (Monotropa), some\r\nof the orchids, etc., are _humus saprophytes_ and some of them are\r\npossibly able to absorb organic food from the humus, many of them have\r\nfungus mycelium in close connection with their roots, and these fungus\r\nthreads aid in the absorption of organic food. The roots of plants\r\nwhich have fungus mycelium intimately associated in connection with\r\nthe process of nutrition, are termed _mycorhiza_. There is a mutual\r\ninterchange of food between the fungus and the host, a _reciprocal\r\nsymbiosis_.\r\n\r\n=192. Mycorhiza are of two kinds= as regards the relation of\r\nthe fungus to the root; _ectotrophic_ (or _epiphytic_), where the\r\nmycelium is chiefly on the outside of the root, and _endotrophic_ (or\r\n_endophytic_) where the mycelium is chiefly within the tissue of the\r\nroot.\r\n\r\n=193. Ectotrophic mycorhiza.=—Ectotrophic mycorhiza occur on the\r\nroots of the oak, beech, hornbean, etc., in forests where there is a\r\ngreat deal of humus from decaying leaves and other vegetation. The\r\nyoung growing roots of these trees become closely covered with a thick\r\nfelt of the mycelium, so that no root hairs can develop. The terminal\r\nroots also branch profusely and are considerably thickened. The fungus\r\nserves here as the absorbent organ for the tree. It also acts on the\r\nhumus, converting some of it into available plant food and transferring\r\nit over to the tree.\r\n\r\n=194. Endotrophic mycorhiza.=—These are found on many of the\r\nhumus saprophytes, which are devoid of chlorophyll, as well as on those\r\npossessing little or even on some plants possessing an abundance, of\r\nchlorophyll. Examples are found in many orchids (see the coral root\r\norchid, for example), some of the ferns (Botrychium), the pines,\r\nleguminous plants, etc. In endotrophic mycorhiza the mycelium is more\r\nabundant within the tissues of the root, though some of the threads\r\nextend to the outside. In the case of the mycorhiza on the humus\r\nsaprophytes which have no chlorophyll, or but little, it is thought\r\nby some that the fungus mycelium in the humus assists in converting\r\norganic substances and carbohydrates into a form available for food\r\nby the higher plant and then conducts it into the root, thus aiding\r\nalso in the process of absorption, since there are few or no root\r\nhairs on the short and fleshy mycorhiza. The roots, however, of some\r\nof these humus saprophytes have the power of absorbing a portion of\r\ntheir organic compounds from the humus. It is thought by some, though\r\nnot definitely demonstrated, that in the case of the oaks, beeches,\r\nhornbeans, and other chlorophyll-bearing symbionts, the fungus threads\r\ndo not absorb any carbohydrates for the higher symbiont, but that they\r\nactually derive their carbohydrates from it.[14] But it is reasonably\r\ncertain that the fungus threads do assimilate from the humus certain\r\nunoxidized, or feebly oxidized, nitrogenous substances (ammonia, for\r\nexample), and transfer them over to the host, for the higher plants\r\nwith difficulty absorb these substances, while they readily absorb\r\nnitrates which are not abundant in humus. This is especially important\r\nin the forest. It is likely therefore.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Nitrogen gatherers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 81. Root of the common vetch, showing root\r\ntubercles.]\r\n\r\n=195. How clovers, peas, and other legumes gather nitrogen.=—It\r\nhas long been known that clover plants, peas, beans, and many other\r\nleguminous plants are often able to thrive in soil where the cereals\r\ndo but poorly. Soil poor in nitrogenous plant food becomes richer in\r\nthis substance where clovers, peas, etc., are grown, and they are often\r\nplanted for the purpose of enriching the soil. Leguminous plants,\r\nespecially in poor soil, are almost certain to have enlargements, in\r\nthe form of nodules, or “root-tubercles.” A root of the common vetch\r\nwith some of these root-tubercles is shown in fig. 81.\r\n\r\n=196. A fungal or bacterial organism in these root-tubercles.=—If\r\nwe cut one of these root-tubercles open, and mount a small portion\r\nof the interior in water for examination with the microscope, we\r\nshall find small rod-shaped bodies, some of which resemble bacteria,\r\nwhile others are more or less forked into forms like the letter Y, as\r\nshown in fig. 82. These bodies are rich in nitrogenous substances,\r\nor proteids. They are portions of a minute organism, of a fungus or\r\nbacterial nature, which attacks the roots of leguminous plants and\r\ncauses these nodular outgrowths. The organism (Phytomyxa leguminosarum)\r\nexists in the soil and is widely distributed where legumes grow.\r\n\r\n=197. How the organism gets into the roots of the legumes.=—This\r\nminute organism in the soil makes its way through the wall of a root\r\nhair near the end. It then grows down the interior of the root hair in\r\nthe form of a thread. When it reaches the cell walls it makes a minute\r\nperforation, through which it grows to enter the adjacent cell, when it\r\nenlarges again. In this way it passes from the root hair to the cells\r\nof the root and down to near the center of the root. As soon as it\r\nbegins to enter the cells of the root it stimulates the cells of that\r\nportion to greater activity. So the root here develops a large lateral\r\nnodule, or “root-tubercle.” As this “root-tubercle” increases in size,\r\nthe fungus threads branch in all directions, entering many cells. The\r\nthreads are very irregular in form, and from certain enlargements it\r\nappears that the rod-like bodies are formed, or the thread later breaks\r\ninto myriads of these small “bacteroids.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 82. Root-tubercle organism from vetch, old\r\ncondition.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 83. Root-tubercle organism from Medicago\r\ndenticulata.]\r\n\r\n=198. The root organism assimilates free nitrogen for its\r\nhost.=—This organism assimilates the free nitrogen from the air\r\nin the soil, to make the proteid substance which is found stored in\r\nthe bacteroids in large quantities. Some of the bacteroids, rich in\r\nproteids, are dissolved, and the proteid substance is made use of by\r\nthe clover or pea, as the case may be. This is why such plants can\r\nthrive in soil with a poor nitrogen content. Later in the season some\r\nof the root-tubercles die and decay. In this way some of the proteid\r\nsubstance is set free in the soil. The soil thus becomes richer in\r\nnitrogenous plant food.\r\n\r\nThe forms of the bacteroids vary. In some of the clovers they are oval,\r\nin vetch they are rod-like or forked, and other forms occur in some of\r\nthe other genera.\r\n\r\n=199.= NOTE.—So far as we know the legume tubercle\r\norganism does not assimilate free nitrogen of the air unless it is\r\nwithin the root of the legume. But there are microörganisms in the\r\nsoil which are capable of assimilating free nitrogen independently.\r\nExample, a bacterium, _Clostridium pasteurianum_. Certain bacteria\r\nand algæ live in _contact symbiosis_ in the soil, the bacteria fixing\r\nfree nitrogen, while in return for the combined nitrogen, the algæ\r\nfurnish the bacteria with carbohydrates. It seems that these bacteria\r\ncannot fix the free nitrogen of the air unless they are supplied with\r\ncarbohydrates, and it is known that _Clostridium pasteurianum_ cannot\r\nassimilate free nitrogen unless sugar is present.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Lichens.\r\n\r\n=200. Nutrition of lichens.=—Lichens are very curious plants\r\nwhich grow on rocks, on the trunks and branches of trees, and on the\r\nsoil. They form leaf-like expansions more or less green in color, or\r\nbrownish, or gray, or they occur in the form of threads, or small\r\ntree-like formations. Sometimes the plant fits so closely to the rock\r\non which it grows that it seems merely to paint the rock a slightly\r\ndifferent color, and in the case of many which occur on trees there\r\nappears to be to the eye only a very slight discoloration of the bark\r\nof the trunk, with here and there the darker colored points where fruit\r\nbodies are formed. The most curious thing about them is, however,\r\nthat while they form plant bodies of various form, these bodies are\r\nof a “dual nature” as regards the organisms composing them. The plant\r\nbodies, in other words, are formed of two different organisms which,\r\nwoven together, exist apparently as one. A fungus on the one hand grows\r\naround and encloses in the meshes of its mycelium the cells or threads\r\nof an alga, as the case may be.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 84. Frond of lichen (peltigera), showing rhizoids.]\r\n\r\nIf we take one of the leaf-like forms known as peltigera, which grows\r\non damp soil or on the surfaces of badly decayed logs, we see that the\r\nplant body is flattened, thin, crumpled, and irregularly lobed. The\r\ncolor is dull greenish on the upper side, while the under side is white\r\nor light gray, and mottled with brown, especially the older portions.\r\nHere and there on the under surface are quite long slender blackish\r\nstrands. These are composed entirely of fungus threads and serve as\r\norgans of attachment or holdfasts, and for the purpose of supplying\r\nthe plant body with mineral substances which are in solution in the\r\nwater of the soil. If we make a thin section of the leaf-like portion\r\nof a lichen as shown in fig. 85, we shall see that it is composed of a\r\nmesh of colorless threads which in certain definite portions contain\r\nentangled green cells. The colorless threads are those of the fungus,\r\nwhile the green cells are those of the alga. These green cells of the\r\nalga perform the function of chlorophyll bodies for the dual organism,\r\nwhile the threads of the fungus provide the mineral constituents of\r\nplant food. The alga, while it is not killed in the embrace of the\r\nfungus, does not reach the perfect state of development which it\r\nattains when not in connection with the fungus. On the other hand the\r\nfungus profits more than the alga by this association. It forms fruit\r\nbodies, and perfects spores in the special fruit bodies, which are so\r\nvery distinct in the case of so many of the species of the lichens.\r\nThese plants have lived for so long a time in this close association\r\nthat the fungi are rarely found separate from the algæ in nature, but\r\nin a number of cases they have been induced to grow in artificial\r\ncultures separate from the alga. This fact, and also the fact that the\r\nalgæ are often found to occur separate from the fungus in nature, is\r\nregarded by many as an indication that the plant body of the lichens is\r\ncomposed of two distinct organisms, and that the fungus is parasitic on\r\nthe alga.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 85.\r\n\r\nLichen (peltigera), section of thallus; dark zone of rounded bodies\r\nmade up largely of the algal cells. Fungus cells above, and threads\r\nbeneath and among the algal cells.]\r\n\r\n=201.= Others regard the lichens as autonomous plants, that is,\r\nthe two organisms have by this long-continued community of existence\r\nbecome unified into an individualized organism, which possesses a habit\r\nand mode of life distinct from that of either of the organisms forming\r\nthe component parts. This community of existence between two different\r\norganisms is called by some _mutualism_, or _symbiosis_. While the alga\r\nenclosed within the meshes of the fungus is not so free to develop,\r\nand probably does not attain the full development which it would alone\r\nunder favorable conditions, still it is very likely that it is often\r\npreserved from destruction during very dry periods, within the tough\r\nthallus, on the surface of bare rocks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 86. Section of fruit body or apothecium of lichen\r\n(parmelia), showing asci and spores of the fungus.]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[12] Calcium is not essential for the growth of the fungi.\r\n\r\n[13] For example, silicon is used by some plants in strengthening\r\nsupporting tissues. Buckwheat thrives better when supplied with a\r\nchloride.\r\n\r\n[14] Evidence points to the belief that certain cells of the host form\r\nsubstances which attract, chemitropically, the fungus threads, and that\r\nin these cells the fungus threads are more abundant than in others.\r\nFurthermore in the vicinity of the nucleus of the host seems to be the\r\nplace where these activities are more marked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nHOW PLANTS OBTAIN THEIR FOOD, II.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeedlings.\r\n\r\n=202.= It is evident from some of the studies which we have made\r\nin connection with germination of seeds and nutrition of the plant\r\nthat there is a period in the life of the seed plants in which they\r\nare able to grow if supplied with moisture, but may entirely lack any\r\nsupply of food substance from the outside, though we understand that\r\ngrowth finally comes to a standstill unless they are supplied with food\r\nfrom the outside. In connection with the study of the nutrition of the\r\nplant, therefore, it will be well to study some of the representative\r\nseeds and seedlings to learn more accurately the method of germination\r\nand nutrition in seedlings during the germinating period.\r\n\r\n=203. To prepare seeds for germination.=—Soak a handful of\r\nseeds (or more if the class is large) in water for 12 to 24 hours.\r\nTake shallow crockery plates, or ordinary plates, or a germinator\r\nwith a fluted bottom. Place in the bottom some sheets of paper, and\r\nif sphagnum moss is at hand scatter some over the paper. If the moss\r\nis not at hand, throw the upper layer of paper into numerous folds.\r\nThoroughly wet the paper and moss, but do not have an excess of water.\r\nScatter the seeds among the moss or the folds of the paper. Cover\r\nwith some more wet paper and keep in a room where the temperature is\r\nabout 20°C. to 25°C. The germinator should be looked after to see that\r\nthe paper does not become dry. It may be necessary to cover it with\r\nanother vessel to prevent the too rapid evaporation of the water. The\r\ngerminator should be started about a week before the seedlings are\r\nwanted for study. Some of the soaked seeds should be planted in soil in\r\npots and kept at the same temperature, for comparison with those grown\r\nin the germinator.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 87. Section of corn seed; at upper right of each is\r\nthe plantlet, next the cotyledon, at left the endosperm.]\r\n\r\n=204. Structure of the grain of corn.=—Take grains of corn that\r\nhave been soaked in water for 24 hours and note the form and difference\r\nin the two sides (in all of these studies the form and structure of\r\nthe seed, as well as the stages in germination, should be illustrated\r\nby the student). Make a longisection of a grain of corn through the\r\nmiddle line, if necessary making several in order to obtain one which\r\nshows the structures well near the smaller end of the grain. Note\r\nthe following structures: 1st, the hard outer “wall” (formed of the\r\nconsolidated wall of the ovary with the integuments of the ovules—see\r\nChapters 35 and 36); 2d, the greater mass of starch and other plant\r\nfood (the endosperm) in the centre; 3d, a somewhat crescent-shaped body\r\n(the _scutellum_) lying next the endosperm and near the smaller end of\r\nthe grain; 4th, the remaining portion of the young embryo lying between\r\nthe scutellum and the seed coat in the depression. When good sections\r\nare made one can make out the radicle at the smaller end of the seed,\r\nand a few successive leaves (the plumule) which lie at the opposite\r\nend of the embryo shown by sharply curved parallel lines. Observe the\r\nattachment of the scutellum to the caulicle at the point of junction\r\nof the plumule and the radicle. The scutellum is a part of the embryo\r\nand represents a cotyledon. The endosperm is also called _albumen_, and\r\nsuch a seed is _albuminous_.\r\n\r\nDissect out an embryo from another seed, and compare with that seen in\r\nthe section.\r\n\r\n=205.= In the germination of the grain of corn the endosperm\r\nsupplies the food for the growth of the embryo until the roots are\r\nwell established in the soil and the leaves have become expanded and\r\ngreen, in which stage the plant has become able to obtain its food from\r\nthe soil and air and live independently. The starch in the endosperm\r\ncannot of course be used for food by the embryo in the form of starch.\r\nIt is first converted into a soluble form and then absorbed through\r\nthe surface of the scutellum or cotyledon and carried to all parts of\r\nthe embryo. An enzyme developed by the embryo acts upon the starch,\r\nconverting it into a form of sugar which is in solution and can thus\r\nbe absorbed. This enzyme is one of the so-called diastatic “ferments”\r\nwhich are formed during the germination of all seeds which contain food\r\nstored in the form of starch. In some seedlings, this diastase formed\r\nis developed in much greater abundance than in others, for example,\r\nin barley. Examine grains of corn still attached to seedlings several\r\nweeks old and note that a large part of their content has been used up.\r\nThe action of diastase on starch is described in Chapter 8.\r\n\r\n=206. Structure of the pumpkin seed.=—The pumpkin seed has a\r\ntough papery outer covering for the protection of the embryo plant\r\nwithin. This covering is made up of the seed coats. When the seed is\r\nopened by slitting off these coats there is seen within the “meat”\r\nof the pumpkin seed. This is nothing more than the embryo plant. The\r\nlarger part of this embryo consists of two flattened bodies which\r\nare more prominent than any other part of the plantlet at this time.\r\nThese two flattened bodies are the two first leaves, usually called\r\n_cotyledons_. If we spread these cotyledons apart we see that they are\r\nconnected at one end. Lying between them at this point of attachment\r\nis a small bud. This is the _plumule_. The plumule consists of the\r\nvery young leaves at the end of the stem which will grow as the seed\r\ngerminates. At the other end where the cotyledons are joined is a small\r\nprojection, the young root, often termed the _radicle_.\r\n\r\n=207. How the embryo gets out of a pumpkin seed.=—To see how the\r\nembryo gets out of the pumpkin seed we should examine seeds germinated\r\nin the folds of damp paper or on damp sphagnum, as well as some which\r\nhave been germinated in earth. Seeds should be selected which represent\r\nseveral different stages of germination.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 88. Germinating seed of pumpkin, showing how the\r\nheel or “peg” catches on the seed coat to cast it off.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 89. Escape of the pumpkin seedling from the seed\r\ncoats.]\r\n\r\n=208. The peg helps to pull the seed coats apart.=—The root\r\npushes its way out from between the stout seed coats at the smaller\r\nend, and then turns downward unless prevented from so doing by a hard\r\nsurface. After the root is 2-4_cm_ long, and the two halves of the seed\r\ncoats have begun to be pried apart, if we look in this rift at the\r\njunction of the root and stem, we shall see that one end of the seed\r\ncoat is caught against a heel, or “peg,” which has grown out from the\r\nstem for this purpose. Now if we examine one which is a little more\r\nadvanced, we shall see this heel more distinctly, and also that the\r\nstem is arching out away from the seed coats. As the stem arches up\r\nits back in this way it pries with the cotyledons against the upper\r\nseed coat, but the lower seed coat is caught against this heel, and\r\nthe two are pulled gradually apart. In this way the embryo plant pulls\r\nitself out from between the seed coats. In the case of seeds which are\r\nplanted deeply in the soil we do not see this contrivance unless we dig\r\ndown into the earth. The stem of the seedling arches through the soil,\r\npulling the cotyledons up at one end. Then it straightens up, the green\r\ncotyledons part, and open out their inner faces to the sunlight, as\r\nshown in fig. 90. If we dig into the soil we shall see that this same\r\nheel is formed on the stem, and that the seed coats are cast off into\r\nthe soil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 90. Pumpkin seedling rising from the ground.]\r\n\r\n=209. Parts of the pumpkin seedling.=—During the germination of\r\nthe seed all parts of the embryo have enlarged. This increase in size\r\nof a plant is one of the peculiarities of growth. The cotyledons have\r\nelongated and expanded somewhat, though not to such a great extent\r\nas the root and the stem. The cotyledons also have become green on\r\nexposure to the light. Very soon after the main root has emerged from\r\nthe seed coats, other lateral roots begin to form, so that the root\r\nsoon becomes very much branched. The main root with its branches makes\r\nup the root system of the seedling. Between the expanded cotyledons is\r\nseen the plumule. This has enlarged somewhat, but not nearly so much as\r\nthe root, or the part of the stem which extends below the cotyledons.\r\nThis part of the stem, i.e., that part below the cotyledons and\r\nextending to the beginning of the root, is called in all seedlings the\r\n_hypocotyl_, which means “below the cotyledon.”\r\n\r\n=210. The common garden bean.=—The common garden bean, or the\r\nlima bean, may be used for study. The garden bean is not so flattened\r\nor broadened as the lima bean. It is rounded compressed, elongate\r\nslightly curved, slightly concave on one side and convex on the other,\r\nand the ends are rounded. At the middle of the concave side note the\r\ndistinct scar (the hilum) formed where the bean seed separates from\r\nits attachment to the wall of the pod. Upon one side of this scar is a\r\nslight prominence which is continued for a short distance toward the\r\nend of the bean in the form of a slight ridge. This is the _raphe_, and\r\nrepresents that part of the stalk of the ovule which is joined to the\r\nside of the ovule when the latter is curved around against it (see\r\nChapter 36), and at the outer end of the raphe is the _chalaza_,\r\nthe point where the stalk is joined to the end of the ovule, best\r\nunderstood in a straight ovule. Upon the opposite side of the scar\r\nand close to it can be seen a minute depression, the _micropyle_.\r\nUnderneath the seed coat and lying between this point and the end of\r\nthe seed is the _embryo_, which gives greater prominence to the bean at\r\nthis point, but it is especially more prominent after the bean has been\r\nsoaked in water. Soak the beans in water and as they are swelling note\r\nhow the seed coats swell faster than the inner portion of the seed,\r\nwhich causes them to wrinkle in a curious way, but finally the inner\r\nportion swells and fills the seed coat out smooth again. Sketch a bean\r\nshowing all the external features both in side view and in front. Split\r\none lengthwise and sketch the half to which the embryo clings, noting\r\nthe young root, stem, and the small leaves which were lying between\r\nthe cotyledons. There is no endosperm here now, since it was all used\r\nup in the growth of the embryo, and a large part of its substance was\r\nstored up in the cotyledons. As the seed germinates the young plant\r\ngets its first food from that stored in the cotyledons. The hypocotyl\r\nelongates, becomes strongly arched, and at last straightens up, lifting\r\nthe cotyledons from the soil. As the cotyledons become exposed to the\r\nlight they assume a green color. Some of the stored food in them goes\r\nto nourish the embryo during germination, and they therefore become\r\nsmaller, shrivel somewhat, and at last fall off.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 91. Garden bean.\r\n\r\n_m_, micropyle; _h_, hilum or scar; _r_, raphe; _c_, point where\r\nchalaza lies.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 92. Bean seed split open to show plantlet.]\r\n\r\n=211. The castor-oil bean.=—This is not a true bean, since it\r\nbelongs to a very different family of plants (Euphorbiaceæ). In the\r\ngermination of this seed a very interesting comparison can be made with\r\nthat of the garden bean. As the “bean” swells the very hard outer coat\r\ngenerally breaks open at the free end and slips off at the stem end.\r\nThe next coat within, which is also hard and shining black, splits\r\nopen at the opposite end, that is at the stem end. It usually splits\r\nopen in the form of three ribs. Next within the inner coat is a very\r\nthin, whitish film (the remains of the nucellus, and corresponding to\r\nthe perisperm) which shrivels up and loosens from the white mass, the\r\nendosperm, within. In the castor-oil bean, then, the endosperm is not\r\nall absorbed by the embryo during the formation of the seed. As the\r\nplant becomes older we should note that the fleshy endosperm becomes\r\nthinner and thinner, and at last there is nothing but a thin, whitish\r\nfilm covering the green faces of the cotyledons. The endosperm has been\r\ngradually absorbed by the germinating plant through its cotyledons and\r\nused for food.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 93.\r\n\r\nHow the garden bean comes out of the ground. First the looped\r\nhypocotyl, then the cotyledons pulled out, next casting off the seed\r\ncoat, last the plant erect, bearing thick cotyledons, the expanding\r\nleaves, and the plumule between them.]\r\n\r\n\r\nArisæma triphyllum.[15]\r\n\r\n=212. Germination of seeds of jack-in-the-pulpit.=—The ovaries\r\nof jack-in-the-pulpit form large, bright red berries with a soft pulp\r\nenclosing one to several large seeds. The seeds are oval in form. Their\r\ngermination is interesting, and illustrates one type of germination of\r\nseeds common among monocotyledonous plants. If the seeds are covered\r\nwith sand, and kept in a moist place, they will germinate readily.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 94. Germination of castor-oil bean.]\r\n\r\n=213. How the embryo backs out of the seed.=—The embryo lies\r\nwithin the mass of the endosperm; the root end, near the smaller end of\r\nthe seed. The club-shaped cotyledon lies near the middle of the seed,\r\nsurrounded firmly on all sides by the endosperm. The stalk, or petiole,\r\nof the cotyledon, like the lower part of the petiole of the leaves, is\r\na hollow cylinder, and contains the younger leaves, and the growing end\r\nof the stem or bud. When germination begins, the stalk, or petiole, of\r\nthe cotyledon elongates. This pushes the root end of the embryo out\r\nat the small end of the seed. The free end of the embryo now enlarges\r\nsomewhat, as seen in the figures, and becomes the bulb, or corm, of the\r\nyoung plant. At first no roots are visible, but in a short time one,\r\ntwo, or more roots appear on the enlarged end.\r\n\r\n=214. Section of an embryo.=—If we make a longisection of the\r\nembryo and seed at this time we can see how the club-shaped cotyledon\r\nis closely surrounded by the endosperm. Through the cotyledon, then,\r\nthe nourishment from the endosperm is readily passed over to the\r\ngrowing embryo. In the hollow part of the petiole near the bulb can be\r\nseen the first leaf.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 95. Seedlings of castor-oil bean casting the seed\r\ncoats, and showing papery remnant of the endosperm.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 96. Seedlings of jack-in-the-pulpit; embryo backing\r\nout of the seed.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 97.\r\n\r\nSection of germinating embryos of jack-in-the-pulpit, showing young\r\nleaves inside the petiole of the cotyledon. At the left cotyledon shown\r\nsurrounded by the endosperm in the seed; at right endosperm removed to\r\nshow the club-shaped cotyledon.]\r\n\r\n=215. How the first leaf appears.=—As the embryo backs out of\r\nthe seed, it turns downward into the soil, unless the seed is so lying\r\nthat it pushes straight downward. On the upper side of the arch thus\r\nformed, in the petiole of the cotyledon, a slit appears, and through\r\nthis opening the first leaf arches its way out. The loop of the petiole\r\ncomes out first, and the leaf later, as shown in fig. 98. The petiole\r\nnow gradually straightens up, and as it elongates the leaf expands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 98. Seedlings of jack-in-the-pulpit, first leaf\r\narching out of the petiole of the cotyledon.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 99. Embryos of jack-in-the-pulpit still attached to\r\nthe endosperm in seed coats, and showing the simple first leaf.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 100. Seedling of jack-in-the-pulpit; section of the\r\nendosperm and cotyledon.]\r\n\r\n=216. The first leaf of the jack-in-the-pulpit is a simple\r\none.=—The first leaf of the embryo jack-in-the-pulpit is very\r\ndifferent in form from the leaves which we are accustomed to see on\r\nmature plants. If we did not know that it came from the seed of this\r\nplant we would not recognize it. It is simple, that is it consists\r\nof one lamina or blade, and not of three leaflets as in the compound\r\nleaf of the mature plant. The simple leaf is ovate and with a broad\r\nheart-shaped base. The jack-in-the-pulpit, then, as trillium, and some\r\nother monocotyledonous plants which have compound leaves on the mature\r\nplants, have simple leaves during embryonic development. The ancestral\r\nmonocotyledons are supposed to have had simple leaves. Thus there is in\r\nthe embryonic development of the jack-in-the-pulpit, and others with\r\ncompound leaves, a sort of recapitulation of the evolutionary history\r\nof the leaf in these forms.\r\n\r\n=216=_a_. =Germination of the pea.=—Compare with the bean.\r\nNote especially that the cotyledons are not lifted above the soil as in\r\nthe beans. Compare germination of acorns.\r\n\r\n\r\nDigestion.\r\n\r\n=216=_b_. =To test for stored food substance in the seedlings\r\nstudied.=—The pumpkin, squash, and castor-oil bean are examples\r\nof what are called oily seeds, since considerable oil is stored up\r\nin the protoplasm in the cotyledons. To test for this, remove a\r\nsmall portion of the substance from the cotyledon of the squash and\r\ncrush it on a glass slip in a drop or two of osmic acid.[16] Put on a\r\ncover glass and examine with a microscope. The black amorphous matter\r\nshows the presence of oil in the protoplasm. The small bodies which are\r\nstained yellow are _aleurone_ grains, a form of protein or albuminous\r\nsubstance. Both the oil and the protein substance are used by the\r\nseedling during germination. The oil is converted into an available\r\nfood form by the action of an enzyme called _lipase_, which splits up\r\nthe fatty oil into glucose and other substances. Lipase has been found\r\nin the endosperm of the castor-oil, cocoanut, and in the cotyledons\r\nof the pumpkin, as well as in other seeds containing oil as a stored\r\nproduct. The aleurone is made available by an enzyme of the nature of\r\ntrypsin. Test the endosperm of the castor-oil bean in the same way.\r\nMake another test of both the squash and castor-oil seeds with iodine\r\nto show that starch is not present.\r\n\r\nTest the cotyledon of the bean with iodine for the presence of\r\nstarch. If the endosperm of corn seed has not been tested do so now\r\nwith iodine. The endosperm consists largely of starch. The starch is\r\nconverted to glucose by a diastatic “ferment” formed by the seedling as\r\nit germinates. Make a thin cross-section of a grain of wheat, including\r\nthe seed coat and a portion of the interior, treat with iodine and\r\nmount for microscopic examination. Note the abundance of starch in the\r\ninternal portion of endosperm. Note a layer of cells on the outside of\r\nthe starch portions filled with small bodies which stain yellow. These\r\nare aleurone grains. The cellulose in the cell walls of the endosperm\r\nis dissolved by another enzyme called _cytase_, and some plants store\r\nup cellulose for food. For example, in the endosperm of the _date_ the\r\ncell walls are very much thickened and pitted. The cell walls consist\r\nof reserve cellulose and the seedling makes use of it for food during\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\n=216=_c_. =Albuminous and exalbuminous seeds.=—In seeds\r\nwhere the food is stored outside of the embryo they are called\r\n_albuminous_; examples, corn, wheat and other cereals, Indian turnip,\r\netc. In those seeds where the food is stored up in the embryo they are\r\ncalled _exalbuminous_; examples, bean, pea, pumpkin, squash, etc.\r\n\r\n=217. Digestion= has a well-defined meaning in animal physiology\r\nand relates to the conversion of solid food, usually within the\r\nstomach, into a soluble form by the action of certain gastric juices,\r\nso that the liquid food may be absorbed into the circulatory system.\r\nThe term is not often applied in plant physiology, since the method\r\nof obtaining food is in general fundamentally different in plants and\r\nanimals. It is usually applied to the process of the conversion of\r\nstarch into some form of sugar in solution, as glucose, etc. This we\r\nhave found takes place in the leaf, especially at night, through the\r\naction of a diastatic ferment developed more abundantly in darkness. As\r\na result, the starch formed during the day in the leaves is digested\r\nat night and converted into sugar, in which form it is transferred to\r\nthe growing parts to be employed in the making of new tissues, or it is\r\nstored for future use; in other cases it unites with certain inorganic\r\nsubstances, absorbed by the roots and raised to the leaf, to form\r\nproteids and other organic substances. In tubers, seeds, parts of stems\r\nor leaves where starch is stored, it must first be “digested” by the\r\naction of some enzyme before it can be used as food by the sprouting\r\ntubers or germinating seeds.\r\n\r\nFor example, starch is converted to a glucose by the action of a\r\ndiastase. Cellulose is converted to a glucose by cytase. Albuminoids\r\nare converted into available food by a tryptic ferment. Fatty oils are\r\nconverted into glucose and other products by lipase.\r\n\r\nInulin, a carbohydrate closely related to starch, is stored up for\r\nfood in solution in many composite plants, as in the artichoke, the\r\nroot tuber of dahlia, etc. When used for food by the growing plant\r\nit is converted into glucose by an enzyme, inulase. Make a section\r\nof a portion of a dahlia tuber or artichoke and treat with alcohol.\r\nThe inulin is precipitated into sphæro crystals. (See also paragraphs\r\n156-161 and 216_b_.)\r\n\r\n=218.= Then there are certain fungi which feed on starch or other\r\norganic substances whether in the host or not, which excrete certain\r\nenzymes to dissolve the starch, etc., to bring it into a soluble\r\nform before they can absorb it as food. Such a process is a sort of\r\n_extracellular digestion_, i.e., the organism excretes the enzyme and\r\ndigests the solid outside, since it cannot take the food within its\r\ncells in the solid form. To a certain degree the higher plants perform\r\nalso extracellular digestion in the action of root hair excretion on\r\ninsoluble substances, and in the case of the humus saprophytes. But for\r\nthem soluble food is largely prepared by the action of acids, etc., in\r\nthe soil or water, or by the work of fungi and bacteria as described in\r\nChapter 9.\r\n\r\n=219. Assimilation.=—In plant physiology the term assimilation\r\nhas been chiefly used for the process of carbon dioxide assimilation\r\n(= photosynthesis). Some objections have been raised against the use\r\nof assimilation here as one of the life processes of the plant, since\r\nits inception stages are due to the combined action of light, an\r\nexternal factor, and chlorophyll in the plant along with the living\r\nchloroplastid. So long, however, as it is not known that this process\r\ncan take place without the aid of the living plant, it does not seem\r\nproper to deny that it is altogether not a process of assimilation. It\r\nis not necessary to restrict the term assimilation to the formation\r\nof new living matter in the plant cell; it can be applied also to\r\nthe synthetic processes in the formation of carbohydrates, proteids,\r\netc., and called synthetic assimilation. The sun supplies the energy,\r\nwhich is absorbed by the chlorophyll, for splitting up the carbonic\r\nacid, and the living chloroplast then assimilates by a synthetic\r\nprocess the carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. This process then can be\r\ncalled _photosynthetic assimilation_. The nitrite and nitrate bacteria\r\nderive energy in the process of nitrification, which enables them\r\nto assimilate CO₂ from the air, and this is called _chemosynthetic\r\nassimilation_. The inorganic material in the form of mineral salts,\r\nnitrates, etc., absorbed by the root, and carried up to the leaves,\r\nhere meets with the carbohydrates manufactured in the leaf. Under\r\nthe influence of the protoplasm synthesis takes place, and proteids\r\nand other organic compounds are built up by the union of the salts,\r\nnitrates, etc., with the carbohydrates. This is also a process of\r\nsynthetic assimilation. These are afterward stored as food, or\r\nassimilated by the protoplasm in the making of new living matter, or\r\nperhaps without the first process of synthetic assimilation some of the\r\ninorganic salts, nitrates, and carbohydrates meeting in the protoplasm\r\nare assimilated into new living matter directly.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[15] In lieu of Arisæma make a practical study of the pea. See\r\nparagraph 216_a_.\r\n\r\n[16] Dissolve a half gram of osmic acid in 50 _cc._ of water and keep\r\ntightly corked when not using.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nRESPIRATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n=220.= One of the life processes in plants which is extremely\r\ninteresting, and which is exactly the same as one of the life processes\r\nof animals, is easily demonstrated in several ways.\r\n\r\n=221. Simple experiment to demonstrate the evolution of CO₂ during\r\ngermination.=—Where there are a number of students and a number of\r\nlarge cylinders are not at hand, take bottles of a pint capacity and\r\nplace in the bottom some peas soaked for 12 to 24 hours. Cover with\r\na glass plate which has been smeared with vaseline to make a tight\r\njoint with the mouth of the bottle. Set aside in a warm place for 24\r\nhours. Then slide the glass plate a little to one side and quickly\r\npour in a little baryta water so that it will run down on the inside\r\nof the bottle. Cover the bottle again. Note the precipitate of barium\r\ncarbonate which demonstrates the presence of CO₂ in the bottle. Lower a\r\nlighted taper. It is extinguished because of the great quantity of CO₂.\r\nIf flower buds are accessible, place a small handful in each of several\r\njars and treat the same as in the case of the peas. Young growing\r\nmushrooms are excellent also for this experiment, and serve to show\r\nthat respiration takes place in the fungi.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 101. Test for presence of carbon dioxide in vessel\r\nwith germinating peas. (Sachs.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 102. Apparatus to show respiration of germinating\r\nwheat.]\r\n\r\n=222.= If we now take some of the baryta water and blow our\r\n“breath” upon it the same film will be formed. The carbon dioxide which\r\nwe exhale is absorbed by the baryta water, and forms barium carbonate,\r\njust as in the case of the peas. In the case of animals the process by\r\nwhich oxygen is taken into the body and carbon dioxide is given off is\r\n_respiration_. The process in plants which we are now studying is the\r\nsame, and also is respiration. The oxygen in the vessel was partly used\r\nup in the process, and carbon dioxide was given off. (It will be seen\r\nthat this process is exactly the opposite of that which takes place in\r\ncarbon dioxide assimilation.)\r\n\r\n=223. To show that oxygen from the air is used up while plants\r\nrespire.=—Soak some wheat for 24 hours in water. Remove it from\r\nthe water and place it in the folds of damp cloth or paper in a moist\r\nvessel. Let it remain until it begins to germinate. Fill the bulb of\r\na thistle tube with the germinating wheat. By the aid of a stand and\r\nclamp, support the tube upright, as shown in fig. 102. Let the small\r\nend of the tube rest in a strong solution of caustic potash (one stick\r\ncaustic potash in two-thirds tumbler of water) to which red ink has\r\nbeen added to give a deep red color. Place a small glass plate over the\r\nrim of the bulb and seal it air-tight with an abundance of vaseline.\r\nTwo tubes can be set up in one vessel, or a second one can be set up in\r\nstrong baryta water colored in the same way.\r\n\r\n=224. The result.=—It will be seen that the solution of caustic\r\npotash rises slowly in the tube; the baryta water will also, if that is\r\nused. The solution is colored so that it can be plainly seen at some\r\ndistance from the table as it rises in the tube. In the experiment\r\nfrom which the figure was made for the accompanying illustration, the\r\nsolution had risen in 6 hours to the height shown in fig. 102. In 24\r\nhours it had risen to the height shown in fig. 103.\r\n\r\n=225. Why the solution of caustic potash rises in the\r\ntube.=—Since no air can get into the thistle tube from above or\r\nbelow, it must be that some part of the air which is inside of the\r\ntube is used up while the wheat is germinating. From our study of\r\ngerminating peas, we know that a suffocating gas, carbon dioxide, is\r\ngiven off while respiration takes place. The caustic potash solution,\r\nor the baryta water, whichever is used, absorbs the carbon dioxide. The\r\ncarbon dioxide is heavier than air, and so it settles down in the tube\r\nwhere it can be absorbed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 103. Apparatus to show respiration of germinating\r\nwheat.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 104. Pea seedlings; the one at the left had no\r\noxygen and little growth took place, the one at the right in oxygen and\r\ngrowth was evident.]\r\n\r\n=226. Where does the carbon dioxide come from?=—We know it\r\ncomes from the growing seedlings. The symbol for carbon dioxide is\r\nCO₂. The carbon comes from the plant, because there is not enough in\r\nthe air. Nitrogen could not join with the carbon to make CO₂. Some\r\noxygen from the air or from the protoplasm of the growing seedlings\r\n(more probably the latter) joins with some of the carbon of the plant.\r\nThese break away from their association with the living substance and\r\nunite, making CO₂. The oxygen absorbed by the plant from the air unites\r\nwith the living substance, or perhaps first with food substances, and\r\nfrom these the plant is replenished with carbon and oxygen. After the\r\ndemonstration has been made, remove the glass plate which seals the\r\nthistle tube above, and pour in a small quantity of baryta water. The\r\nwhite precipitate formed affords another illustration that carbon\r\ndioxide is released.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 105.\r\n\r\nExperiment to show that growth takes place more rapidly in presence of\r\noxygen than in absence of oxygen. The two tubes in the vessel represent\r\nthe condition at the beginning of the experiment. At the close of the\r\nexperiment the roots in the tube at the left were longer than those\r\nin the tube filled at the start with mercury. The tube outside of\r\nthe vessel represents the condition of things where the peas grew in\r\nabsence of oxygen; the carbon dioxide given off has displaced a portion\r\nof the mercury. This also shows _anaerobic_ respiration.]\r\n\r\n=227. Respiration is necessary for growth.=—After performing\r\nexperiment in paragraph 221, if the vessel has not been open too\r\nlong so that oxygen has entered, we may use the vessel for another\r\nexperiment, or set up a new one to be used in the course of 12 to 24\r\nhours, after some oxygen has been consumed. Place some folded damp\r\nfilter paper on the germinating peas in the jar. Upon this place\r\none-half dozen peas which have just been germinated, and in which the\r\nroots are about 20-25 _mm_ long. The vessel should be covered tightly\r\nagain and set aside in a warm room. A second jar with water in the\r\nbottom instead of the germinating peas should be set up as a check.\r\nDamp folded filter paper should be supported above the water, and on\r\nthis should be placed one-half dozen peas with roots of the same length\r\nas those in the jar containing carbon dioxide.\r\n\r\n=228.= In 24 hours examine and note how much growth has taken\r\nplace. It will be seen that the roots have elongated but very little\r\nor none in the first jar, while in the second one we see that the\r\nroots have elongated considerably, if the experiment has been carried\r\non carefully. Therefore in an atmosphere devoid of oxygen very little\r\ngrowth will take place, which shows that normal respiration with access\r\nof oxygen (aerobic respiration) is necessary for growth.\r\n\r\n=229. Another way of performing the experiment.=—If we wish we\r\nmay use the following experiment instead of the simple one indicated\r\nabove. Soak a handful of peas in water for 12-24 hours, and germinate\r\nso that twelve with the radicles 20-25 _mm_ long may be selected. Fill\r\na test tube with mercury and carefully invert it in a vessel of mercury\r\nso that there will be no air in the upper end. Now nearly fill another\r\ntube and invert in the same way. In the latter there will be some air.\r\nRemove the outer coats from the peas so that no air will be introduced\r\nin the tube filled with the mercury, and insert them one at a time\r\nunder the edge of the tube beneath the mercury, six in each tube,\r\nhaving first measured the length of the radicles. Place in a warm\r\nroom. In 24 hours measure the roots. Those in the air will have grown\r\nconsiderably, while those in the other tube will have grown but little\r\nor none.\r\n\r\n=230. Anaerobic respiration.=—The last experiment is also an\r\nexcellent one to show _anaerobic_ respiration. In the tube filled\r\nwith mercury so that when inverted there will be no air, it will be\r\nseen after 24 hours that a gas has accumulated in the tube which has\r\ncrowded out some of the mercury. With a wash bottle which has an exit\r\ntube properly curved, some water may be introduced in the tube. Then\r\ninsert underneath a small stick of caustic potash. This will form a\r\nsolution of potash, and the gas will be partly or completely absorbed.\r\nThis shows that the gas was carbon dioxide. This evolution of carbon\r\ndioxide by living plants when there is no access of oxygen is anaerobic\r\nrespiration (sometimes called intramolecular respiration). It occurs\r\nmarkedly in oily seeds and especially in the yeast plant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 106. Test for liberation of carbon dioxide from\r\nleafy plant during respiration. Baryta water in smaller vessel.\r\n(Sachs.)]\r\n\r\n=231. Energy set free during respiration.=—From what we have\r\nlearned of the exchange of gases during respiration we infer that the\r\nplant loses carbon during this process. If the process of respiration\r\nis of any benefit to the plant, there must be some gain in some\r\ndirection to compensate the plant for the loss of carbon which takes\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nIt can be shown by an experiment that during respiration there is a\r\nslight elevation of the temperature in the plant tissues. The plant\r\nthen gains some heat during respiration. Energy is also manifested by\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\n=232. Respiration in a leafy plant.=—We may take a potted plant\r\nwhich has a well-developed leaf surface and place it under a tightly\r\nfitting bell jar. Under the bell jar there also should be placed a\r\nsmall vessel containing baryta water. A similar apparatus should be set\r\nup, but with no plant, to serve as a check. The experiment must be set\r\nup in a room which is not frequented by persons, or the carbon dioxide\r\nin the room from respiration will vitiate the experiment. The bell jar\r\ncontaining the plant should be covered with a black cloth to prevent\r\ncarbon assimilation. In the course of 10 or 12 hours, if everything has\r\nworked properly, the baryta water under the jar with the plant will\r\nshow the film of barium carbonate, while the other one will show none.\r\nRespiration, therefore, takes place in a leafy plant as well as in\r\ngerminating seeds.\r\n\r\n=233. Respiration in fungi.=—If several large actively growing\r\nmushrooms are accessible, place them in a tall glass jar as described\r\nfor determining respiration in germinating peas. In the course of 12\r\nhours test with the lighted taper and the baryta water. Respiration\r\ntakes place in fungi as well as in green plants.\r\n\r\n=234. Respiration in plants in general.=—Respiration is general\r\nin all plants, though not universal. There are some exceptions in the\r\nlower plants, notably in certain of the bacteria, which can only grow\r\nand thrive in the absence of oxygen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 107. Fermentation tube with culture of yeast.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 108. Fermentation tube filled with CO₂ from action\r\nof yeast in a sugar solution.]\r\n\r\n=235. Respiration a breaking-down process.=—We have seen that\r\nin respiration the plant absorbs oxygen and gives off carbon dioxide.\r\nWe should endeavor to note some of the effects of respiration on the\r\nplant. Let us take, say, two dozen dry peas, weigh them, soak for 12-24\r\nhours in water, and, in the folds of a cloth kept moist by covering\r\nwith wet paper or sphagnum, germinate them. When well germinated and\r\nbefore the green color appears dry well in the sun, or with artificial\r\nheat, being careful not to burn or scorch them. The aim should be to\r\nget them about as dry as the seeds were before germination. Now weigh.\r\nThe germinated seeds weigh less than the dry peas. There has then been\r\na loss of plant substance during respiration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 108_a_.\r\n\r\nYeast. Saccharomyces ceriviseæ. _a_, small colony; _b_, single cell\r\nbudding; _c_, single cell forming an ascus with four spores; _d_,\r\nspores free from the ascus. (After Rees.)]\r\n\r\n=236. Fermentation of yeast.=—Take two fermentation tubes. Fill\r\nthe closed tubular parts of each with a weak solution of grape sugar,\r\nor with potato decoction, leaving the open bulb nearly empty. Into the\r\nliquid of one of the tubes place a piece of compressed yeast as large\r\nas a pea. If the tubes are kept in a warm place for 24 hours bubbles\r\nof gas may be noticed rising in the one in which the yeast was placed,\r\nwhile in the second tube no such bubbles appear, especially if the\r\nfilled tubes are first sterilized. The tubes may be kept until the\r\nfirst is entirely filled with the gas. Now dissolve in the liquid a\r\nsmall piece of caustic potash. Soon the gas will begin to be absorbed,\r\nand the liquid will rise until it again fills the tube. The gas was\r\ncarbon dioxide, which was chiefly produced during the anaerobic\r\nrespiration of the rapidly growing yeast cells. In bread making this\r\ngas is produced in considerable quantities, and rising through the\r\ndough fills it with numerous cavities containing gas, so that the bread\r\n“rises.” When it is baked the heat causes the gas in the cavities to\r\nexpand greatly. This causes the bread to “rise” more, and baked in this\r\ncondition it is “light.” There are two special processes accompanying\r\nthe fermentation by yeast: 1st, the evolution of carbon dioxide as\r\nshown above; and, 2d, the formation of alcohol. The best illustration\r\nof this second process is the brewing of beer, where a form of the same\r\norganism which is employed in “bread rising” is used to “brew beer.”\r\n\r\n=237. The yeast plant.=—Before the caustic potash is placed in\r\nthe tube some of the fermented liquid should be taken for study of\r\nthe yeast plant, unless separate cultures are made for this purpose.\r\nPlace a drop of the fermented liquid on a glass slip, place on this\r\na cover glass, and examine with the microscope. Note the minute oval\r\ncells with granular protoplasm. These are the yeast plant. Note in\r\nsome a small “bud” at one side of the end. These buds increase in size\r\nand separate from the parent plant. The yeast plant is one-celled,\r\nand multiplies by “budding” or “sprouting.” It is a fungus, and some\r\nspecies of yeast like the present one do not form any mycelium. Under\r\ncertain conditions, which are not very favorable for growth (example,\r\nwhen the yeast is grown in a weak nutrient substance on a thin layer of\r\na plaster Paris slab), several spores are formed in many of the yeast\r\ncells. After a period of rest these spores will sprout and produce the\r\nyeast plant again. Because of this peculiar spore formation some place\r\nthe yeast among the sac fungi. (See classification of the fungi.)\r\n\r\n=238. Organized ferments and unorganized ferments.=—An organism\r\nlike the yeast plant which produces a fermentation of a liquid with\r\nevolution of gas and alcohol is sometimes called a _ferment_, or\r\n_ferment organism_, or an _organized_ ferment. On the other hand the\r\ndiastatic ferments or enzymes like diastase, taka diastase, animal\r\ndiastase (ptyalin in the saliva), cytase, etc., are _unorganized_\r\nferments. In the case of these it is better to say _enzyme_ and leave\r\nthe word ferment for the ferment organisms.\r\n\r\n=239. Importance of green plants in maintaining purity of air.=—By\r\nrespiration, especially of animals, the air tends to become “foul”\r\nby the increase of CO₂. Green plants, i.e., plants with chlorophyll,\r\npurify the air during photosynthesis by absorbing CO₂ and giving off\r\noxygen. Animals absorb in respiration large quantities of oxygen and\r\nexhale large quantities of CO₂. Plants absorb a comparatively small\r\namount of oxygen in respiration and give off a comparatively small\r\namount of CO₂. But they absorb during photosynthesis large quantities\r\nof CO₂ and give off large quantities of oxygen. In this way a balance is\r\nmaintained between the two processes, so that the percentage of CO₂ in\r\nthe air remains approximately the same, viz., about four-tenths of one\r\nper cent, while there are approximately 21 parts oxygen and 79 parts\r\nnitrogen.\r\n\r\n=239a. Comparison of respiration and photosynthesis.=\r\n\r\n                       { Carbon dioxide is taken in by the plant and\r\n                       {      oxygen is liberated.\r\n                       { Starch is formed as a result of the metabolism,\r\n                       {      or chemical change.\r\n                       { The process takes place only in green plants,\r\n    Starch formation   {      and in the green parts of plants, that is,\r\n    or Photosynthesis. {      in the presence of the chlorophyll.\r\n                       {     (Exception in purple bacterium.)\r\n                       { The process only takes place under the\r\n                       {      influence of sunlight.\r\n                       { It is a building-up process, because new plant\r\n                       {      substance is formed.\r\n\r\n                       { Oxygen is taken in by the plant and carbon\r\n                       {      dioxide is liberated.\r\n                       { Carbon dioxide is formed as a result of the\r\n                       {      metabolism, or chemical change.\r\n                       { The process takes place in all plants whether\r\n    Respiration.       {      they possess chlorophyll or not.\r\n                       {     (Exceptions in anaerobic bacteria).\r\n                       { The process takes place in the dark as well as\r\n                       {      in the sunlight.\r\n                       { It is a breaking-down process, because\r\n                       {      disintegration of plant substance occurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nGROWTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy growth is usually meant an increase in the bulk of the plant\r\naccompanied generally by an increase in plant substance. Among the\r\nlower plants growth is easily studied in some of the fungi.\r\n\r\n=240. Growth in mucor.=—Some of the gonidia (often called spores)\r\nmay be sown in nutrient gelatine or agar, or even in prune juice. If\r\nthe culture has been placed in a warm room, in the course of 24 hours,\r\nor even less, the preparation will be ready for study.\r\n\r\n=241. Form of the gonidia.=—It will be instructive if we first\r\nexamine some of the gonidia which have not been sown in the culture\r\nmedium. We should note their rounded or globose form, as well as\r\ntheir markings if they belong to one of the species with spiny walls.\r\nParticularly should we note the size, and if possible measure them with\r\nthe micrometer, though this would not be absolutely necessary for a\r\ncomparison, if the comparison can be made immediately. Now examine some\r\nof the gonidia which were sown in the nutrient medium. If they have not\r\nalready germinated we note at once that they are much larger than those\r\nwhich have not been immersed in a moist medium.\r\n\r\n=242. The gonidia absorb water and increase in size before\r\ngerminating.=—From our study of the absorption of water or watery\r\nsolutions of nutriment by living cells, we can easily understand the\r\ncause of this enlargement of the gonidium of the mucor when surrounded\r\nby the moist nutrient medium. The cell-sap in the spore takes up more\r\nwater than it loses by diffusion, thus drawing water forcibly through\r\nthe protoplasmic membrane. Since it does not filter out readily, the\r\nincrease in quantity of the water in the cell produces a pressure from\r\nwithin which stretches the membrane, and the elastic cell wall yields.\r\nThus the gonidium becomes larger.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 109. Spores of mucor, and different stages of\r\ngermination.]\r\n\r\n=243. How the gonidia germinate.=—We should find at this time\r\nmany of the gonidia extended on one side into a tube-like process the\r\nlength of which varies according to time and temperature. The short\r\nprocess thus begun continues to elongate. This elongation of the plant\r\nis _growth_, or, more properly speaking, one of the phenomena of growth.\r\n\r\n=244. The germ tube branches and forms the mycelium.=—In the\r\ncourse of a day or so branches from the tube will appear. This branched\r\nform of the threads of the fungus is, as we remember, the mycelium. We\r\ncan still see the point where growth started from the gonidium. Perhaps\r\nby this time several tubes have grown from a single one. The threads of\r\nthe mycelium near the gonidium, that is, the older portions of them,\r\nhave increased in diameter as they have elongated, though this increase\r\nin diameter is by no means so great as the increase in length. After\r\nincreasing to a certain extent in diameter, growth in this direction\r\nceases, while apical growth is practically unlimited, being limited\r\nonly by the supply of nutriment.\r\n\r\n=245. Growth in length takes place only at the end of the thread.=—If\r\nthere were any branches on the mycelium when the culture was first\r\nexamined, we can now see that they remain practically the same distance\r\nfrom the gonidium as when they were first formed. That is, the older\r\nportions of the mycelium do not elongate. Growth in length of the\r\nmycelium is confined to the ends of the threads.\r\n\r\n=246. Protoplasm increases by assimilation of nutrient\r\nsubstances.=—As the plant increases in bulk we note that there\r\nis an increase in the protoplasm, for the protoplasm is very easily\r\ndetected in these cultures of mucor. This increase in the quantity\r\nof the protoplasm has come about by the assimilation of the nutrient\r\nsubstance, which the plant has absorbed. The increase in the\r\nprotoplasm, or the formation of additional plant substance, is another\r\nphenomenon of growth quite different from that of elongation, or\r\nincrease in bulk.\r\n\r\n=247. Growth of roots.=—For the study of the growth of roots we\r\nmay take any one of many different plants. The seedlings of such plants\r\nas peas, beans, corn, squash, pumpkin, etc., serve excellently for this\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n=248. Roots of the pumpkin.=—The seeds, a handful or so, are\r\nsoaked in water for about 12 hours, and then placed between layers of\r\npaper or between the folds of cloth, which must be kept quite moist but\r\nnot very wet, and should be kept in a warm place. A shallow crockery\r\nplate, with the seeds lying on wet filter paper, and covered with\r\nadditional filter paper, or with a bell jar, answers the purpose well.\r\n\r\nThe primary or first root (radicle) of the embryo pushes its way out\r\nbetween the seed coats at the small end. When the seeds are well\r\ngerminated, select several which have the root 4-5 _cm_ long. With a\r\ncrow-quill pen we may now mark the terminal portion of the root off\r\ninto very short sections as in fig. 110. The first mark should be\r\nnot more than 1 _mm_ from the tip, and the others not more than 1mm\r\napart. Now place the seedlings down on damp filter paper, and cover\r\nwith a bell jar so that they will remain moist, and if the season is\r\ncold place them in a warm room. At intervals of 8 or 10 hours, if\r\nconvenient, observe them and note the farther growth of the root.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 110. Root of germinating pumpkin, showing region of\r\nelongation just back of the tip.]\r\n\r\n=249. The region of elongation.=—While the root has elongated,\r\nthe region of elongation _is not at the tip of the root. It lies a\r\nlittle distance back from the tip_, beginning at about 2mm from the tip\r\nand extending over an area represented by from 4-5 of the millimeter\r\nmarks. The root shown in fig. 110 was marked at 10 A.M. on\r\nJuly 5. At 6 P.M. of the same day, 8 hours later, growth had\r\ntaken place as shown in the middle figure. At 9 A.M. on the\r\nfollowing day, 15 hours later, the growth is represented in the lower\r\none. Similar experiments upon a number of seedlings give the same\r\nresult: the region of elongation in the growth of the root is situated\r\na little distance back from the tip. Farther back very little or no\r\nelongation takes place, but growth in diameter continues for some time,\r\nas we should discover if we examined the roots of growing pumpkins, or\r\nother plants, at different periods.\r\n\r\n=250. Movement of region of greatest elongation.=—In the region\r\nof elongation the areas marked off do not all elongate equally at the\r\nsame time. The middle spaces elongate most rapidly and the spaces\r\nmarked off by the 6, 7, and 8 _mm_ marks elongate slowly, those\r\nfarthest from the tip more slowly than the others, since elongation\r\nhas nearly ceased here. The spaces marked off between the 2-4 _mm_\r\nmarks also elongate slowly, but soon begin to elongate more rapidly,\r\nsince that region is becoming the region of greatest elongation. Thus\r\nthe region of greatest elongation moves forward as the root grows, and\r\nremains approximately at the same distance behind the tip.\r\n\r\n=251. Formative region.=—If we make a longitudinal section of the\r\ntip of a growing root of the pumpkin or other seedling, and examine it\r\nwith the microscope, we see that there is a great difference in the\r\ncharacter of the cells of the tip and those in the region of elongation\r\nof the root. First there is in the section a V-shaped cap of loose\r\ncells which are constantly being sloughed off. Just back of this tip\r\nthe cells are quite regularly isodiametric, that is, of equal diameter\r\nin all directions. They are also very rich in protoplasm, and have\r\nthin walls. This is the region of the root where new cells are formed\r\nby division. It is the _formative region_. The cells on the outside\r\nof this area are the older, and pass over into the older parts of the\r\nroot and root cap. If we examine successively the cells back from this\r\n_formative_ region we find that they become more and more elongated in\r\nthe direction of the axis of the root. The elongation of the cells in\r\nthis older portion of the root explains then why it is that this region\r\nof the root elongates more rapidly than the tip.\r\n\r\n=252. Growth of the stem.=—We may use a bean seedling growing\r\nin the soil. At the junction of the leaves with the stem there are\r\nenlargements. These are the _nodes_, and the spaces on the stem between\r\nsuccessive nodes are the _internodes_. We should mark off several of\r\nthese internodes, especially the younger ones, into sections about 5\r\n_mm_ long. Now observe these at several times for two or three days,\r\nor more. The region of elongation is greater than in the case of the\r\nroots, and extends back farther from the end of the stem. In some young\r\ngarden bean plants the region of elongation extended over an area of 40\r\n_mm_ in one internode. See also Chapters 38, 39.\r\n\r\n=253. Force exerted by growth.=—One of the marvelous things\r\nconnected with the growth of plants is the force which is exerted by\r\nvarious members of the plant under certain conditions. Observations on\r\nseedlings as they are pushing their way through the soil to the air\r\noften show us that considerable force is required to lift the hard soil\r\nand turn it to one side. A very striking illustration may be had in the\r\ncase of mushrooms which sometimes make their way through the hard and\r\npacked soil of walks or roads. That succulent and tender plants should\r\nbe capable of lifting such comparatively heavy weights seems incredible\r\nuntil we have witnessed it. Very striking illustrations of the force\r\nof roots are seen in the case of trees which grow in rocky situations,\r\nwhere rocks of considerable weight are lifted, or small rifts in large\r\nrocks are widened by the lateral pressure exerted by the growth of a\r\nroot, which entered when it was small and wedged its way in.\r\n\r\n=254. Zone of maximum growth.=—Great variation exists in the\r\nrapidity of growth even when not influenced by outside conditions. In\r\nour study of the elongation of the root we found that the cells just\r\nback of the formative region elongated slowly at first. The rapidity of\r\nthe elongation of these cells increases until it reaches the maximum.\r\nThen the rapidity of elongation lessens as the cells come to lie\r\nfarther from the tip. The period of maximum elongation here is the\r\n_zone of maximum growth_ of these cells.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 111. Lever auxanometer (Oels) for measuring\r\nelongation of the stem during growth.]\r\n\r\n=255.= Just as the cells exhibit a zone of maximum growth, so\r\nthe members of the plant exhibit a similar zone of maximum growth.\r\nIn the case of leaves, when they are young the rapidity of growth\r\nis comparatively slow, then it increases, and finally diminishes in\r\nrapidity again. So it is with the stem. When the plant is young the\r\ngrowth is not so rapid; as it approaches middle age the rapidity of\r\ngrowth increases; then it declines in rapidity at the close of the\r\nseason.\r\n\r\n=256. Energy of growth.=—Closely related to the zone of maximum\r\ngrowth is what is termed the energy of growth. This is manifested in\r\nthe comparative size of the members of a given plant. To take the\r\nsunflower for example, the lower and first leaves are comparatively\r\nsmall. As the plant grows larger the leaves are larger, and this\r\nincrease in size of the leaves increases up to a maximum period, when\r\nthe size decreases until we reach the small leaves at the top of the\r\nstem. The zone of maximum growth of the leaves corresponds with the\r\nmaximum size of the leaves on the stem. The rapidity and energy of\r\ngrowth of the stem is also correlated with that of the leaves, and the\r\nzone of maximum growth is coincident with that of the leaves. It would\r\nbe instructive to note it in the case of other plants and also in the\r\ncase of fruits.\r\n\r\n=257. Nutation.=—During the growth of the stem all of the cells\r\nof a given section of the stem do not elongate simultaneously. For\r\nexample the cells at a given moment on the south side are elongating\r\nmore rapidly than the cells on the other side. This will cause the\r\nstem to bend slightly to the north. In a few moments later the cells\r\non the west side are elongating more rapidly, and the stem is turned\r\nto the east; and so on, groups of cells in succession around the stem\r\nelongate more rapidly than the others. This causes the stem to describe\r\na circle or ellipse about a central point. Since the region of greatest\r\nelongation of the cells of the stem is gradually moving toward the apex\r\nof the growing stem, this line of elongation of the cells which is\r\ntraveling around the stem does so in a spiral manner. In the same way,\r\nwhile the end of the stem is moving upward by the elongation of the\r\ncells, and at the same time is slowly moved around, the line which the\r\nend of the stem describes must be a spiral one. This movement of the\r\nstem, which is common to all stems, leaves, and roots, is _nutation_.\r\n\r\n=258.= The importance of nutation to twining stems in their search\r\nfor a place of support, as well as for the tendrils on leaves or stems,\r\nwill be seen. In the case of the root it is of the utmost importance,\r\nas the root makes its way through the soil, since the particles of soil\r\nare more easily thrust aside. The same is also true in the case of many\r\nstems before they emerge from the soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nIRRITABILITY.\r\n\r\n\r\n=259.= We should now examine the movements of plant parts in\r\nresponse to the influence of certain stimuli. By this time we have\r\nprobably observed that the direction which the root and stem take upon\r\ngermination of the seed is not due to the position in which the seed\r\nhappens to lie. Under normal conditions we have seen that the root\r\ngrows downward and the stem upward.\r\n\r\n=260. Influence of the earth on the direction of growth.=—When\r\nthe stem and root have been growing in these directions for a short\r\ntime let us place the seedling in a horizontal position, so that the\r\nend of the root extends over an object of support in such a way that it\r\nwill be free to go in any direction. It should be pinned to a cork and\r\nplaced in a moist chamber. In the course of twelve to twenty-four hours\r\nthe root which was formerly horizontal has turned the tip downward\r\nagain. If we should mark off millimeter spaces beginning at the tip of\r\nthe root, we should find that the motor zone, or region of curvature,\r\nlies in the same region as that of the elongation of the root.\r\n\r\nKnight found that the stimulus which influences the root to turn\r\ndownward is the force of gravity. The reaction of the root in response\r\nto this stimulus is geotropism, a turning influenced by the earth. This\r\nterm is applied to the growth movements of plants influenced by the\r\nearth with regard to direction. While the motor zone lies back of the\r\nroot-tip, the latter receives the stimulus and is the perceptive zone.\r\nIf the root-tip is cut off, the root is no longer geotropic, and will\r\nnot turn downward when placed in a horizontal position. Growth toward\r\nthe earth is _progeotropism_. The lateral growth of secondary roots is\r\n_diageotropism_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 112. Germinating pea placed in a horizontal\r\nposition.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 113. In 24 hours gravity has caused the root to\r\nturn downward.\r\n\r\nFigs. 112, 113.—Progeotropism of the pea root.]\r\n\r\nThe stem, on the other hand, which was placed in a horizontal position\r\nhas become again erect. This turning of the stem in the upward\r\ndirection takes place in the dark as well as in the light, as we can\r\nsee if we start the experiment at nightfall, or place the plant in the\r\ndark. This upward growth of the stem is also influenced by the earth,\r\nand therefore is a case of geotropism. The special designation in the\r\ncase of upright stems is _negative geotropism_, or _apogeotropism_, or\r\nthe stems are said to be _apogeotropic_. If we place a rapidly growing\r\npotted plant in a horizontal position by laying the pot on its side,\r\nthe ends of the shoots will soon turn upward again when placed in a\r\nhorizontal position. Young bean plants growing in a pot began within\r\ntwo hours to turn the ends of the shoots upward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 114. Pumpkin seedling showing apogeotropism.\r\nSeedling at the left placed horizontally, in 24 hours the stem has\r\nbecome erect.]\r\n\r\nHorizontal leaves and shoots can be shown to be subject to the same\r\ninfluence, and are therefore _diageotropic_.\r\n\r\n=261. Influence of light.=—Not only is light a very important\r\nfactor for plants during photosynthesis, it exerts great influence on\r\nplant growth and movement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 115. Radish seedlings grown in the dark, long,\r\nslender, not green.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 116. Radish seedlings grown in the light, shorter,\r\nstouter, and green in color. Growth retarded by light.]\r\n\r\n=262. Growth in the absence of light.=—Plants grown in the dark\r\nare subject to a number of changes. The stems are often longer,\r\nmore slender and weaker since they contain a larger amount of water\r\nin proportion to building material which the plant obtains from\r\ncarbohydrates manufactured in the light. On many plants the leaves are\r\nvery small when grown in the dark.\r\n\r\n=263. Influence of light on direction of growth.=—While we are\r\ngrowing seedlings, the pots or boxes of some of them should be placed\r\nso that the plants will have a one-sided illumination. This can be\r\ndone by placing them near an open window, in a room with a one-sided\r\nillumination, or they may be placed in a box closed on all sides but\r\none which is facing the window or light. In 12-24 hours, or even in a\r\nmuch shorter time in some cases, the stems of the seedlings will be\r\ndirected toward the source of light. This influence exerted by the rays\r\nof light is _heliotropism_, a turning influenced by the sun or sunlight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 117. Seedling of castor-oil bean, before and after\r\na one-sided illumination.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 118. Dark chamber with opening at one side to show\r\nheliotropism. (After Schleichert.)]\r\n\r\n=264. Diaheliotropism.=—Horizontal leaves and shoots are\r\n_diaheliotropic_ as well as _diageotropic_. The general direction which\r\nleaves assume under this influence is that of placing them with the\r\nupper surface perpendicular to the rays of light which fall upon them.\r\nLeaves, then, exposed to the brightly lighted sky are, in general,\r\nhorizontal. This position is taken in direct response to the stimulus\r\nof light. The leaves of plants with a one-sided illumination, as can be\r\nseen by trial, are turned with their upper surfaces toward the source\r\nof light, or perpendicular to the incidence of the light rays. In this\r\nway light overcomes for the time being the direction which growth\r\ngives to the leaves. The so-called “sleep” of plants is of course\r\nnot sleep, though the leaves “nod,” or hang downward, in many cases.\r\nThere are many plants in which we can note this drooping of the leaves\r\nat nightfall, and in order to prove that it is not determined by the\r\ntime of day we can resort to a well-known experiment to induce this\r\ncondition during the day. The plant which has been used to illustrate\r\nthis is the sunflower. Some of these plants, which were grown in a box,\r\nwhen they were about 35 _cm_ high were covered for nearly two days,\r\nso that the light was excluded. At midday on the second day the box\r\nwas removed, and the leaves on the covered plants are well represented\r\nby fig. 119, which was made from one of them. The leaves of the other\r\nplants in the box which were not covered were horizontal, as shown by\r\nfig. 120. Now on leaving these plants, which had exhibited induced\r\n“sleep” movements, exposed to the light they gradually assumed the\r\nhorizontal position again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 119. Sunflower plant. Epinastic condition of leaves\r\ninduced during the day in darkness.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 120. Sunflower plant removed from darkness, leaves\r\nextending under influence of light (diaheliotropism.)]\r\n\r\n=265. Epinasty and hyponasty.=—During the early stages of growth\r\nof many leaves, as in the sunflower plant, the direction of growth is\r\ndifferent from what it is at a later period. The under surface of the\r\nyoung leaves grows more rapidly in a longitudinal direction than the\r\nupper side, so that the leaves are held upward close against the bud\r\nat the end of the stem. This is termed _hyponasty_, or the leaves are\r\nsaid to be _hyponastic_. Later the growth is more rapid on the upper\r\nside and the leaves turn downward or away from the bud. This is termed\r\n_epinasty_, or the leaves are said to be _epinastic_. This is shown by\r\nthe night position of the leaves, or in the induced “sleep” of the\r\nsunflower plant in the experiment detailed above. The day position of\r\nthe leaves on the other hand, which is more or less horizontal, is\r\ninduced because of their irritability under the influence of light, the\r\ninherent downward or epinastic growth is overcome for the time. Then\r\nat nightfall or in darkness, the stimulus of light being removed, the\r\nleaves assume the position induced by the direction of growth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 121. Squash seedling. Position of cotyledons in\r\nlight.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 122. Squash seedling. Position of cotyledons in the\r\ndark.]\r\n\r\n=266.= In the case of the cotyledons of some plants it would seem\r\nthat the growth was hyponastic even after they have opened. The day\r\nposition of the cotyledons of the pumpkin is more or less horizontal,\r\nas shown in fig. 121. At night, or if we darken the plant by covering\r\nwith a tight box, the leaves assume the position shown in fig. 122.\r\n\r\nWhile the horizontal position is the general one which is assumed\r\nby plants under the influence of light, their position is dependent\r\nto a certain extent on the intensity of the light as well as on the\r\nincidence of the light rays. Some plants are so strongly heliotropic\r\nthat they change their positions all during the day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 123. Coiling tendril of bryony.]\r\n\r\n=267. Leaves with a fixed diurnal position.=—Leaves of some\r\nplants when they are developed have a fixed diurnal position and are\r\nnot subject to variation. Such leaves tend to arrange themselves in a\r\nvertical or paraheliotropic position, in which the surfaces are not\r\nexposed to the incidence of light of the greatest intensity, but to the\r\nincidence of the rays of diffused light. Interesting cases of the fixed\r\nposition of leaves are found in the so-called compass plants (like\r\nSilphium laciniatum, Lactuca scariola, etc.). In these the horizontal\r\nleaves arrange themselves with the surfaces vertical, and also pointing\r\nnorth and south, so that the surfaces face east and west.\r\n\r\n=268. Importance of these movements.=—Not only are the leaves\r\nplaced in a position favorable for the absorption of the rays of light\r\nwhich are concerned in making carbon available for food, but they\r\nderive other forms of energy from the light, as heat, which is absorbed\r\nduring the day. Then with the nocturnal position, the leaves being\r\ndrooped down toward the stem, or with the margin toward the sky, or\r\nwith the cotyledons as in the pumpkin, castor-oil bean, etc., clasped\r\nupward together, the loss of heat by radiation is less than it would be\r\nif the upper surfaces of the leaves were exposed to the sky.\r\n\r\n=269. Influence of light on the structure of the leaf.=—In our\r\nstudy of the structure of a leaf we found that in the ivy leaf the\r\npalisade cells were on the upper surface. This is the case with a great\r\nmany leaves, and is the normal arrangement of “dorsiventral” leaves\r\nwhich are diaheliotropic. Leaves which are paraheliotropic tend to have\r\npalisade cells on both surfaces. The palisade layer of cells as we\r\nhave seen is made up of cells lying very close together, and they thus\r\nprevent rapid evaporation. They also check to some extent the entrance\r\nof the rays of light, at least more so than the loose spongy parenchyma\r\ncells do. Leaves developed in the shade have looser palisade and\r\nparenchyma cells. In the case of some plants, if we turn over a very\r\nyoung leaf, so that the under side will be uppermost, this side will\r\ndevelop the palisade layer. This shows that light has a great influence\r\non the structure of the leaf.\r\n\r\n=270. Movement influenced by contact.=—In the case of tendrils,\r\ntwining leaves, or stems, the irritability to contact is shown in a\r\nmovement of the tendril, etc., toward the object in touch. This causes\r\nthe tendril or stem to coil around the object for support. The stimulus\r\nis also extended down the part of the tendril below the point of\r\ncontact (see fig. 123), and that part coils up like a wire coil spring,\r\nthus drawing the leaf or branch from which the tendril grows closer to\r\nthe object of support. This coil between the object of support and the\r\nplant is also very important in easing up the plant when subject to\r\nviolent gusts of wind which might tear the plant from its support were\r\nit not for the yielding and springing motion of this coil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 124. Sensitive plant leaf in normal position.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 125. Pinnæ folding up after stimulus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 126. Later all the pinnæ folded and leaf drooped.]\r\n\r\n=271. Sensitive plants.=—These plants are remarkable for the\r\nrapid response to stimuli. Mimosa pudica is an excellent plant to study\r\nfor this purpose.\r\n\r\n=272. Movement in response to stimuli.=—If we pinch with the\r\nforceps one of the terminal leaflets, or tap it with a pencil, the two\r\nend leaflets fold above the “vein” of the pinna. This is immediately\r\nfollowed by the movement of the next pair, and so on as shown in fig.\r\n125, until all the leaflets on this pinna are closed, then the stimulus\r\ntravels down the other pinnæ in a similar manner, and soon the pinnæ\r\napproximate each other and the leaf then drops downward as shown in\r\nfig. 126. The normal position of the leaf is shown in fig. 124. If we\r\njar the plant by striking it or by jarring the pot in which it is grown\r\nall the leaves quickly collapse into the position shown in fig. 126.\r\nIf we examine the leaf now we see minute cushions at the base of each\r\nleaflet, at the junction of the pinnæ with the petiole, and a larger\r\none at the junction of the petiole with the stem. We shall also note\r\nthat the movement resides in these cushions.\r\n\r\n=273. Transmission of the stimulus.=—The transmission of the\r\nstimulus in this mimosa from one part of the plant has been found to be\r\nalong the cells of the bast.\r\n\r\n=274. Cause of the movement.=—The movement is caused by a sudden\r\nloss of turgidity on the part of the cells in one portion of the\r\npulvinus, as the cushion is called. In the case of the large pulvinus\r\nat the base of the petiole this loss of turgidity is in the cells of\r\nthe lower surface. There is a sudden change in the condition of the\r\nprotoplasm of the cells here so that they lose a large part of their\r\nwater. This can be seen if with a sharp knife we cut off the petiole\r\njust above the pulvinus before movement takes place. A drop of liquid\r\nexudes from the cells of the lower side.\r\n\r\n=275. Paraheliotropism of the leaves of the sensitive plant.=—If\r\nthe mimosa plant is placed in very intense light the leaflets will\r\nturn their edges toward the incidence of the rays of light. This is\r\nalso true of other plants in intense light, and is _paraheliotropism_.\r\nTranspiration is thus lessened, and chlorophyll is protected from too\r\nintense light.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 126_a_. Leaf of Venus fly-trap (Dionæa muscipula),\r\nshowing winged petiole and toothed lobes.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 127. Leaf of Drosera rotundifolia, some of the\r\nglandular hairs folding inward as a result of a stimulus.]\r\n\r\nWe thus see that variations in the intensity of light have an important\r\ninfluence in modifying movements. Variations in temperature also exert\r\na considerable influence, rapid elevation of temperature causing\r\ncertain flowers to open, and falling temperature causing them to close.\r\n\r\n=276. Sensitiveness of insectivorous plants.=—The Venus fly-trap\r\n(Dionæa muscipula) and the sundew (drosera) are interesting examples of\r\nsensitive plants, since the leaves close in response to the stimulus\r\nfrom insects.\r\n\r\n=277. Hydrotropism.=—Roots are sensitive to moisture. They will\r\nturn toward moisture. This is of the greatest importance for the\r\nwell-being of the plant, since the roots will seek those places in the\r\nsoil where suitable moisture is present. On the other hand, if the soil\r\nis too wet there is a tendency for the roots to grow away from the\r\nsoil which is saturated with water. In such cases roots are often seen\r\ngrowing upon the surface of the soil so that they may obtain oxygen,\r\nwhich is important for the root in the processes of absorption and\r\ngrowth. Plants then may be injured by an excess of water as well as by\r\na lack of water in the soil.\r\n\r\n=278. Temperature.=—In the experiments on germination thus\r\nfar made it has probably been noted that the temperature has much\r\nto do with the length of time taken for seeds to germinate. It also\r\ninfluences the rate of growth. The effect of different temperatures\r\non the germination of seed can be very well noted by attempting to\r\ngerminate some in rooms at various temperatures. It will be found,\r\nother conditions being equal, that in a moderately warm room, or even\r\nin one quite warm, 25-30 degrees centigrade, germination and growth\r\ngoes on more rapidly than in a cool room, and here more rapidly than in\r\none which is decidedly cold. In the case of most plants in temperate\r\nclimates, growth may go on at a temperature but little above freezing,\r\nbut few will thrive at this temperature.\r\n\r\n=279.= If we place dry peas or beans in a temperature of about\r\n70° C. for 15 minutes they will not be killed, but if they have been\r\nthoroughly soaked in water and then placed at this temperature they\r\nwill be killed, or even at a somewhat lower temperature. The same seeds\r\nin the dry condition will withstand a temperature of 10° C. below, but\r\nif they are first soaked in water this low temperature will kill them.\r\n\r\n=280.= In order to see the effect of freezing we may thoroughly\r\nfreeze a section of a beet root, and after thawing it out place it in\r\nwater. The water is colored by the cell-sap which escapes from the\r\ncells, just as we have seen it does as a result of a high temperature,\r\nwhile a section of an unfrozen beet placed in water will not color it\r\nif it was previously washed.\r\n\r\nIf the slice of the beet is placed at about -6° C. in a shallow glass\r\nvessel, and covered, ice will be formed over the surface. If we examine\r\nit with the microscope ice crystals will be seen formed on the outside,\r\nand these will not be colored. The water for the formation of the\r\ncrystals came from the cell-sap, but the concentrated solutions in the\r\nsap were not withdrawn by the freezing over the surface.\r\n\r\n=281.= If too much water is not withdrawn from the cells of many\r\nplants in freezing, and they are thawed out slowly, the water which was\r\nwithdrawn from the cells will be absorbed again and the plant will not\r\nbe killed. But if the plant is thawed out quickly the water will not\r\nbe absorbed, but will remain on the surface and evaporate. Some will\r\nalso remain in the intercellular spaces, and the plant will die. Some\r\nplants, however, no matter how slowly they are thawed out, are killed\r\nafter freezing, as the leaves of the pumpkin, dahlia, or the tubers of\r\nthe potato.\r\n\r\n=282.= It has been found that as a general rule when plants, or\r\nplant parts, contain little moisture they will withstand quite high\r\ndegrees of temperature, as well as quite low degrees, but when the\r\nparts are filled with sap or water they are much more easily killed.\r\nFor this reason dry seeds and the winter buds of trees, and other\r\nplants, because they contain but little water, are better able to\r\nresist the cold of winters. But when growth begins in the spring, and\r\nthe tissues of these same parts become turgid and filled with water,\r\nthey are quite easily killed by frosts. It should be borne in mind,\r\nhowever, that there is great individual variation in plants in this\r\nrespect, some being more susceptible to cold than others. There is\r\nalso great variation in plants as to their resistance to the cold of\r\nwinters, and of arctic climates, the plants of the latter regions\r\nbeing able to resist very low temperatures. We have examples also in\r\nthe arctic plants, and those which grow in arctic climates on high\r\nmountains, of plants which are able to carry on all the life functions\r\nat temperatures but little above freezing.\r\n\r\nFor further discussion as to relation of plants to temperature, see\r\nChapters 46, 48, 49, and 53.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\nMORPHOLOGY AND LIFE HISTORY OF REPRESENTATIVE PLANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nSPIROGYRA.\r\n\r\n\r\n=283.= In our study of protoplasm and some of the processes of\r\nplant life we became acquainted with the general appearance of the\r\nplant spirogyra. It is now a familiar object to us. And in taking up\r\nthe study of representative plants of the different groups, we shall\r\nfind that in knowing some of these lower plants the difficulties of\r\nunderstanding methods of reproduction and relationship are not so great\r\nas they would be if we were entirely ignorant of any members of the\r\nlower groups.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 128. Thread of spirogyra, showing long cells,\r\nchlorophyll band, nucleus, strands of protoplasm, and the granular wall\r\nlayer of protoplasm.]\r\n\r\n=284. Form of spirogyra.=—We have found that the plant spirogyra\r\nconsists of simple threads, with cylindrical cells attached end to\r\nend. We have also noted that each cell of the thread is exactly alike,\r\nwith the exception of certain “holdfasts” on some of the species. If\r\nwe should examine threads in different stages of growth we should find\r\nthat each cell is capable of growth and division, just as it is capable\r\nof performing all the functions of nutrition and assimilation. The\r\ncells of spirogyra then multiply by division. Not simply the cells at\r\nthe ends of the threads but any and all of the cells divide as they\r\ngrow, and in this way the threads increase in length.\r\n\r\n=285. Multiplication of the threads.=—In studying living material\r\nof this plant we have probably noted that the threads often become\r\nbroken by two of the adjacent cells of a thread becoming separated.\r\nThis may be and is accomplished in many cases without any injury to the\r\ncells. In this manner the threads or plants of spirogyra, if we choose\r\nto call a thread a plant, multiply, or increase. In this breaking of a\r\nthread the cell wall which separates any two cells splits. If we should\r\nexamine several species of spirogyra we would probably find threads\r\nwhich present two types as regards the character of the walls at the\r\nends of the cells. In fig. 128 we see that the ends are plain, that is,\r\nthe cross walls are all straight. But in some other species the inner\r\nwall of the cells presents a peculiar appearance. This inner wall at\r\nthe end of the cell is at first straight across. But it soon becomes\r\nfolded back into the interior of its cell, just as the end of an empty\r\nglove finger may be pushed in. Then the infolded end is pushed partly\r\nout again, so that a peculiar figure is the result.\r\n\r\n=286. How some of the threads break.=—In the separation of the\r\ncells of a thread this peculiarity is often of advantage to the plant.\r\nThe cell-sap within the protoplasmic membrane absorbs water and the\r\npressure pushes on the ends of the infolded cell walls. The inner\r\nwall being so much longer than the outer wall, a pull is exerted on\r\nthe latter at the junction of the cells. Being weaker at this point\r\nthe outer wall is ruptured. The turgidity of the two cells causes\r\nthese infolded inner walls to push out suddenly as the outer wall is\r\nruptured, and the thread is snapped apart as quickly as a pipe-stem may\r\nbe broken.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 129. Zygospores of spirogyra.]\r\n\r\n=287. Conjugation of spirogyra.=—Under certain conditions, when\r\nvegetative growth and multiplication cease, a process of reproduction\r\ntakes place which is of a kind termed sexual reproduction. If we select\r\nmats of spirogyra which have lost their deep green color, we are likely\r\nto find different stages of this sexual process, which in the case of\r\nspirogyra and related plants is called _conjugation_. A few threads\r\nof such a mat we should examine with the microscope. If the material\r\nis in the right condition we see in certain of the cells an oval or\r\nelliptical body. If we note carefully the cells in which these oval\r\nbodies are situated, there will be seen a tube at one side which\r\nconnects with an empty cell of a thread which lies near as shown in\r\nfig. 129. If we search through the material we may see other threads\r\nconnected in this ladder fashion, in which the contents of the cells\r\nare in various stages of collapse from what we have seen in the growing\r\ncell. In some the protoplasm and chlorophyll band have moved but little\r\nfrom the wall; in others it forms a mass near the center of the cell,\r\nand again in others we will see that the contents of the cell of one\r\nof the threads has moved partly through the tube into the cell of the\r\nthread with which it is connected.\r\n\r\n=289.= This suggests to us that the oval bodies found in the cells\r\nof one thread of the ladder, while the cells of the other thread were\r\nempty, are formed by the union of the contents of the two cells. In\r\nfact that is what does take place. This kind of union of the contents\r\nof two similar or nearly similar cells is _conjugation_. The oval\r\nbodies which are the result of this conjugation are _zygotes_, or\r\n_zygospores_. When we are examining living material of spirogyra in\r\nthis stage it is possible to watch this process of conjugation. Fig.\r\n130 represents the different stages of conjugation of spirogyra.\r\n\r\n=290. How the threads conjugate, or join.=—The cells of two\r\nthreads lying parallel put out short processes. The tubes from two\r\nopposite cells meet and join. The walls separating the contents of the\r\ntwo tubes dissolve so that there is an open communication between the\r\ntwo cells. The content of each one of these cells which take part in\r\nthe conjugation is a _gamete_. The one which passes through the tube to\r\nthe receiving cell is the _supplying gamete_, while that of the\r\nreceiving cell is the _receiving gamete_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 130.\r\n\r\n Conjugation in spirogyra; from left to right beginning in the upper\r\nrow is shown the gradual passage of the protoplasm from the supplying\r\ngamete to the receiving gamete.]\r\n\r\n=291. How the protoplasm moves from one cell to another.=—Before\r\nany movement of the protoplasm of the supplying cell takes place we can\r\nsee that there is great activity in its protoplasm. Rounded vacuoles\r\nappear which increase in size, are filled with a watery fluid, and\r\nswell up like a vesicle, and then suddenly contract and disappear.\r\nAs the vacuole disappears it causes a sudden movement or contraction\r\nof the protoplasm around it to take its place. Simultaneously with\r\nthe disappearance of the vacuole the membrane of the protoplasm is\r\nseparated from a part of the wall. This is probably brought about by a\r\nsudden loss of some of the water in the cell-sap. These activities go\r\non, and the protoplasmic membrane continues to slip away from the wall.\r\nEvery now and then there is a movement by which the protoplasm is moved\r\na short distance. It is moved toward the tube and finally a portion of\r\nit with one end of the chlorophyll band begins to move into the tube.\r\nAbout this time the vacuoles can be seen in an active condition in the\r\nreceptive cell. At short intervals movement continues until the content\r\nof the supplying cell has passed over into that of the receptive cell.\r\nThe protoplasm of this one is now slipping away from the cell wall,\r\nuntil finally the two masses round up into the one zygospore.\r\n\r\n=292. The zygospore.=—This zygospore now acquires a thick wall\r\nwhich eventually becomes brown in color. The chlorophyll color fades\r\nout, and a large part of the protoplasm passes into an oily substance\r\nwhich makes it more resistant to conditions which would be fatal to the\r\nvegetative threads. The zygospores are capable therefore of enduring\r\nextremes of cold and dryness which would destroy the threads. They\r\npass through a “resting” period, in which the water in the pond may be\r\nfrozen, or dried, and with the oncoming of favorable conditions for\r\ngrowth in the spring or in the autumn they germinate and produce the\r\ngreen thread again.\r\n\r\n=293. Life cycle.=—The growth of the spirogyra thread, the\r\nconjugation of the gametes and formation of the zygospore, and the\r\ngrowth of the thread from the zygospore again, makes what is called a\r\ncomplete _life cycle_.\r\n\r\n=294. Fertilization.=—While conjugation results in the fusion of\r\nthe two masses of protoplasm, fertilization is accomplished when the\r\nnuclei of the two cells come together in the zygospore and fuse into a\r\nsingle nucleus. The different stages in the fusion of the two nuclei of\r\na recently formed zygospore are shown in figure 131.\r\n\r\nIn the conjugation of the two cells, the chlorophyll band of the\r\nsupplying cell is said to degenerate, so that in the new plant the\r\nnumber of chlorophyll bands in a cell is not increased by the union of\r\nthe two cells.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 131. Fertilization in spirogyra; shows different\r\nstages of fusion of the two nuclei, with mature zygospore at right.\r\n(After Overton.)]\r\n\r\n=295. Simplicity of the process.=—In spirogyra any cell of the\r\nthread may form a gamete (excepting the holdfasts of some species).\r\nSince all of the cells of a thread are practically alike, there is no\r\nstructural difference between a vegetative cell and a cell about to\r\nconjugate. The difference is a physiological one. All the cells are\r\ncapable of conjugation if the physiological conditions are present. All\r\nthe cells therefore are potential gametes. (Strictly speaking the wall\r\nof the cell is the _garnetangium_, while the content forms the gamete.)\r\n\r\nWhile there is sometimes a slight difference in size between the\r\nconjugating cells, and the supplying cell may be the smaller, this is\r\nnot general. We say, therefore, that there is no differentiation among\r\nthe gametes, so that usually before the protoplasm begins to move one\r\ncannot say which is to be the supplying and which the receiving gamete.\r\n\r\n=296. Position of the plant spirogyra.=—From our study then we\r\nsee that there is practically no differentiation among the vegetative\r\ncells, except where holdfasts grow out from some of the cells\r\nfor support. They are all alike in form, in capacity for growth,\r\ndivision, or multiplication of the threads. Each cell is practically\r\nan independent plant. There is no differentiation between vegetative\r\ncell and conjugating cell. All the cells are potential gametes.\r\nFinally there is no structural differentiation between the gametes.\r\nThis indicates then a simple condition of things, a low grade of\r\norganization.\r\n\r\n=297.= The alga spirogyra is one of the representatives of the\r\nlower algæ belonging to the group called _Conjugatæ_. Zygnema with\r\nstar-shaped chloroplasts, mougeotia with straight or sometimes twisted\r\nchlorophyll bands, belong to the same group. In the latter genus only\r\na portion of the protoplasm of each cell unites to form the zygospore,\r\nwhich is located in the tube between the cells.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 132. Closterium.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 133. Micrasterias.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 134. Xanthidium.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 135. Staurastrum.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 136. Euastrum.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 137. Cosmarium.]\r\n\r\n=298.= The desmids also belong to the same group. The desmids\r\nusually live as separate cells. Many of them are beautiful in form.\r\nThey grow entangled among other algæ, or on the surface of aquatic\r\nplants, or on wet soil. Several genera are illustrated in figures\r\n132-137.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nVAUCHERIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n=299.= The plant vaucheria we remember from our study in an\r\nearlier chapter. It usually occurs in dense mats floating on the water\r\nor lying on damp soil. The texture and feeling of these mats remind one\r\nof “felt,” and the species are sometimes called the “green felts.” The\r\nbranched threads are continuous, that is there are no cross walls in\r\nthe vegetative threads. This plant multiplies itself in several ways\r\nwhich would be too tedious to detail here. But when fresh bright green\r\nmats can be obtained they should be placed in a large vessel of water\r\nand set in a cool place. Only a small amount of the alga should be\r\nplaced in a vessel, since decay will set in more rapidly with a large\r\nquantity. For several days one should look for small green bodies which\r\nmay be floating at the side of the vessel next the lighted window.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 138. Portion of branched thread of vaucheria.]\r\n\r\n=300. Zoogonidia of vaucheria.=—If these minute floating green\r\nbodies are found, a small drop of water containing them should be\r\nmounted for examination. If they are rounded, with slender hair-like\r\nappendages over the surface, which vibrate and cause motion, they very\r\nlikely are one of the kinds of reproductive bodies of vaucheria. The\r\nhair-like appendages are _cilia_, and they occur in pairs, several of\r\nthem distributed over the surface. These rounded bodies are _gonidia_,\r\nand because they are motile they are called _zoogonidia_.\r\n\r\nBy examining some of the threads in the vessel where they occurred we\r\nmay have perhaps an opportunity to see how they are produced. Short\r\nbranches are formed on the threads, and the contents are separated from\r\nthose of the main thread by a septum. The protoplasm and other contents\r\nof this branch separate from the wall, round up into a mass, and escape\r\nthrough an opening which is formed in the end. Here they swim around in\r\nthe water for a time, then come to rest, and germinate by growing out\r\ninto a tube which forms another vaucheria plant. It will be observed\r\nthat this kind of reproduction is not the result of the union of two\r\ndifferent parts of the plant. It thus differs from that which is termed\r\nsexual reproduction. A small part of the plant simply becomes separated\r\nfrom it as a special body, and then grows into a new plant, a sort of\r\nmultiplication. This kind of reproduction has been termed _asexual\r\nreproduction_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 139. Young antheridium and oogonium of Vaucheria\r\nsessilis, before separation from contents of thread by a septum.]\r\n\r\n=301. Sexual reproduction in vaucheria.=—The organs which\r\nare concerned in sexual reproduction in vaucheria are very readily\r\nobtained for study if one collects the material at the right season.\r\nThey are found quite readily during the spring and autumn, and may be\r\npreserved in formalin for study at any season, if the material cannot\r\nbe collected fresh at the time it is desired for study. Fine material\r\nfor study often occurs on the soil of pots in greenhouses during the\r\nwinter. While the zoogonidia are more apt to be found in material which\r\nis quite green and freshly growing, the sexual organs are usually more\r\nabundant when the threads appear somewhat yellowish, or yellow green.\r\n\r\n=302. Vaucheria sessilis; the sessile vaucheria.=—In this plant\r\nthe sexual organs are sessile, that is they are not borne on a stalk\r\nas in some other species. The sexual organs usually occur several in a\r\ngroup. Fig. 139 represents a portion of a fruiting plant.\r\n\r\n=303. Sexual organs of vaucheria. Antheridium.=—The antheridia\r\nare short, slender, curved branches from a main thread. A septum is\r\nformed which separates an end portion from the stalk. This end cell\r\nis the _antheridium_. Frequently it is collapsed or empty as shown in\r\nfig. 140. The protoplasm in the antheridium forms numerous small oval\r\nbodies each with two slender lashes, the cilia. When these are formed\r\nthe antheridium opens at the end and they escape. It is after the\r\nescape of these spermatozoids that the antheridium is collapsed. Each\r\nspermatozoid is a male gamete.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 140. Vaucheria sessilis, one antheridium between\r\ntwo oogonia.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 141. Vaucheria sessilis; oogonium opening and\r\nemitting a bit of protoplasm; spermatozoids; spermatozoids entering\r\noogonium. (After Pringsheim and Goebel.)]\r\n\r\n=304. Oogonium.=—The oogonia are short branches also, but\r\nthey become large and somewhat oval. The septum which separates the\r\nprotoplasm from that of the main thread is as we see near the junction\r\nof the branch with the main thread. The oogonium, as shown in the\r\nfigure, is usually turned somewhat to one side. When mature the pointed\r\nend opens and a bit of the protoplasm escapes. The remaining protoplasm\r\nforms the large rounded egg-cell which fills the wall of the oogonium.\r\nIn some of the oogonia which we examine this egg is surrounded by a\r\nthick brown wall, with starchy and oily contents. This is the\r\nfertilized egg (sometimes called here the oospore). It is freed from\r\nthe oogonium by the disintegration of the latter, sinks into the mud,\r\nand remains here until the following autumn or spring, when it grows\r\ndirectly into a new plant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 142. Fertilization in vaucheria, _mn_, male\r\nnucleus; _fn_, female nucleus. Male nucleus entering the egg and\r\napproaching the female nucleus. (After Oltmans.)]\r\n\r\n=305. Fertilization.=—Fertilization is accomplished by the\r\nspermatozoids swimming in at the open end of the oogonium, when one of\r\nthem makes its way down into the egg and fuses with the nucleus of the\r\negg.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 143. Fertilization of vaucheria. _fn_, female\r\nnucleus; _mn_, male nucleus. The different figures show various stages\r\nin the fusion of the nuclei.]\r\n\r\n=306. The twin vaucheria (V. geminata).=—Another species of\r\nvaucheria is the twin vaucheria. This is also a common one, and may be\r\nused for study instead of the sessile vaucheria if the latter cannot\r\nbe obtained. The sexual organs are borne at the end of a club-shaped\r\nbranch. There are usually two oogonia, and one antheridium between them\r\nwhich terminates the branch. In a closely related species, instead of\r\nthe two oogonia there is a whorl of them with the antheridium in the\r\ncenter.\r\n\r\n=307. Vaucheria compared with spirogyra.=—In vaucheria we have a\r\nplant which is very interesting to compare with spirogyra in several\r\nrespects. Growth takes place, not in all parts of the thread, but is\r\nlocalized at the ends of the thread and its branches. This represents a\r\ndistinct advance on such a plant as spirogyra. Again, only specialized\r\nparts of the plant in vaucheria form the sexual organs. These are\r\nshort branches. Farther there is a great difference in the size of the\r\ntwo organs, and especially in the size of the gametes, the supplying\r\ngametes (spermatozoids) being very minute, while the receptive gamete\r\nis large and contains all the nutriment for the fertilized egg. In\r\nspirogyra, on the other hand, there is usually no difference in size\r\nof the gametes, as we have seen, and each contributes equally in the\r\nmatter of nutriment for the fertilized egg. Vaucheria, therefore,\r\nrepresents a distinct advance, not only in the vegetative condition of\r\nthe plant, but in the specialization of the sexual organs. Vaucheria,\r\nwith other related algæ, belongs to a group known as the _Siphoneæ_, so\r\ncalled because the plants are tube-like or _siphon_-like.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 143_a_. Botrydium granulatum. _A_, the whole plant;\r\n_B_, swarm spore; _C_, planogametes; _a_, a single gamete; _b_-_e_, two\r\ngametes in process of fusion; _f_, zygote.]\r\n\r\n=308. Botrydium granulatum.=—An example of one of the simpler\r\nmembers of the Siphoneæ is Botrydium granulatum. It is found sometimes\r\nin abundance on wet ground which is colored green or red by its\r\npresence, according to the stage of development. The plant body is long\r\npear-shaped, the smaller end attached to the ground by slender branched\r\nrhizoids (Fig. 143). The protoplasm contains many nuclei and lines the\r\ninside of the wall. When multiplication takes place large numbers of\r\nsmall zoospores with one cilium each are formed in the protoplasm, and\r\nescape at free end. Reproduction takes place by two-ciliated gametes,\r\nwhich fuse in pairs to form zygospores. In dry seasons the protoplasm\r\nin the pear-shaped plant passes down into the rhizoids and forms\r\nsmall rounded _planospores_. All the stages of development are too\r\ncomplicated to describe here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nŒDOGONIUM.\r\n\r\n\r\n=309.= Œdogonium is also an alga. The plant is sometimes\r\nassociated with spirogyra, and occurs in similar situations. Our\r\nattention was called to it in the study of chlorophyll bodies. These we\r\nrecollect are, in this plant, small oval disks, and thus differ from\r\nthose in spirogyra.\r\n\r\n=310. Form of œdogonium.=—Like spirogyra, œdogonium forms simple\r\nthreads which are made up of cylindrical cells placed end to end. But\r\nthe plant is very different from any member of the group to which\r\nspirogyra belongs. In the first place each cell is not the equivalent\r\nof an individual plant as in spirogyra. Growth is localized or confined\r\nto certain cells of the thread which divide at one end in such a way\r\nas to leave a peculiar overlapping of the cell walls in the form of a\r\nseries of shallow caps or vessels (fig. 144), and this is one of the\r\ncharacteristics of this genus. Other differences we find in the manner\r\nof reproduction.\r\n\r\n=311. Fruiting stage of œdogonium.=—Material in the fruiting\r\nstage is quite easily obtainable, and may be preserved for study in\r\nformalin if there is any doubt about obtaining it at the time we need\r\nit for study. This condition of the plant is easily detected because of\r\nthe swollen condition of some of the cells, or by the presence of brown\r\nbodies with a thick wall in some of the cells.\r\n\r\n=312. Sexual organs of œdogonium. Oogonium and egg.=—The enlarged\r\ncell is the oogonium, the wall of the cell being the wall of the\r\noogonium. (See fig. 145.) The protoplasm inside, before fertilization,\r\nis the egg-cell. In those cases where the brown body with a thick\r\nwall is present fertilization has taken place, and this body is the\r\n_fertilized egg_, or _oospore_. It contains large quantities of an oily\r\nsubstance, and, like the fertilized egg of spirogyra and vaucheria, is\r\nable to withstand greater changes in temperature than the vegetative\r\nstage, and can endure drying and freezing for some time without injury.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 144. Portion of thread of œdogonium, showing\r\nchlorophyll grains, and peculiar cap cell walls.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 145. Œdogonium undulatum, with oogonia and dwarf\r\nmales; the upper oogonium at the right has a mature oospore.]\r\n\r\nIn the oogonium wall there can frequently be seen a rift near the\r\nmiddle of one side, or near the upper end. This is the opening through\r\nwhich the spermatozoid entered to fecundate the egg.\r\n\r\n=313. Dwarf male plants.=—In some species there will also be seen\r\npeculiar club-shaped dwarf plants attached to the side of the oogonium,\r\nor near it, and in many cases the end of this dwarf plant has an open\r\nlid on the end.\r\n\r\n=314. Antheridium.=—The end cell of the dwarf male in such\r\nspecies is the _antheridium_. In other species the spermatozoids are\r\ndeveloped in different cells (antheridia) of the same thread which\r\nbears the oogonium, or on a different thread.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 146. Zoogonidia of œdogonium escaping. At the right\r\none is germinating and forming the holdfasts, by means of which these\r\nalgæ attach themselves to objects for support. (After Pringsheim.)]\r\n\r\n=315. Zoospore stage of œdogonium.=—The egg after a period of\r\nrest starts into active life again. In doing so it does not develop\r\nthe thread-like plant directly as in the case of vaucheria and\r\nspirogyra. It first divides into four zoospores which are exactly like\r\nthe zoogonidia in form. (See fig. 152.) These germinate and develop\r\nthe thread form again. This is a quite remarkable peculiarity of\r\nœdogonium when compared with either vaucheria or spirogyra. It is the\r\nintroduction of an intermediate stage between the fertilized egg and\r\nthat form of the plant which bears the sexual organs, and should be\r\nkept well in mind.\r\n\r\n=316. Asexual reproduction.=—Material for the study of this stage\r\nof œdogonium is not readily obtainable just when we wish it for study.\r\nBut fresh plants brought in and placed in a quantity of fresh water may\r\nyield suitable material, and it should be examined at intervals for\r\nseveral days. This kind of reproduction takes place by the formation\r\nof _zoogonidia_. The entire contents of a cell round off into an oval\r\nbody, the wall of the cell breaks, and the zoogonidium escapes. It has\r\na clear space at the small end, and around this clear space is a row or\r\ncrown of cilia as shown in fig. 146. By the vibration of these cilia\r\nthe zoogonidium swims around for a time, then settles down on some\r\nobject of support, and several slender holdfasts grow out in the form\r\nof short rhizoids which attach the young plant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 147. Portion of thread of œdogonium showing\r\nantheridia.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 148. Portion of thread of œdogonium showing upper\r\nhalf of egg open, and a spermatozoid ready to enter. (After Klebahn).]\r\n\r\n=317. Sexual reproduction. Antheridia.=—The antheridia are short\r\ncells which are formed by one of the ordinary cells dividing into a\r\nnumber of disk-shaped ones as shown in fig. 147. The protoplasm in each\r\nantheridium forms two spermatozoids (sometimes only one) which are of\r\nthe same form as the zoogonidia but smaller, and yellowish instead of\r\ngreen. In some species a motile body intermediate in size and color\r\nbetween the spermatozoids and zoogonidia is first formed, which after\r\nswimming around comes to rest on the oogonium, or near it, and develops\r\nwhat is called a “dwarf male plant” from which the real spermatozoid is\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 149. Male nucleus just entering egg at left side.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 150. Male nucleus fusing with female nucleus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 151. The two nuclei fused, and fertilization\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\nFigs. 149-151.—Fertilization in œdogonium. (After Klebahn).]\r\n\r\n=318. Oogonia.=—The oogonia are formed directly from one of the\r\nvegetative cells. In most species this cell first enlarges in diameter,\r\nso that it is easily detected. The protoplasm inside is the egg-cell.\r\nThe oogonium wall opens, a bit of the protoplasm is emitted, and the\r\nspermatozoid then enters and fertilizes it (fig. 148). Now a hard brown\r\nwall is formed around it, and, just as in spirogyra and vaucheria, it\r\npasses through a resting period. At the time of germination it does\r\nnot produce the thread-like plant again directly, but first forms four\r\nzoospores exactly like the zoogonidia (fig. 152). These zoospores then\r\ngerminate and form the plant.\r\n\r\n=319. Œdogonium compared with spirogyra.=—Now if we compare\r\nœdogonium with spirogyra, as we did in the case of vaucheria, we find\r\nhere also that there is an advance upon the simple condition which\r\nexists in spirogyra. Growth and division of the thread is limited to\r\ncertain portions. The sexual organs are differentiated. They usually\r\ndiffer in form and size from the vegetative cells, though the oogonium\r\nis simply a changed vegetative cell. The sexual organs are\r\ndifferentiated among themselves, the antheridium is small, and the\r\noogonium large. The gametes are also differentiated in size, and the\r\nmale gamete is motile, and carries in its body the nucleus which fuses\r\nwith the nucleus of the egg-cell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 152. Fertilized egg of œdogonium after a period of\r\nrest escaping from the wall of the oogonium, and dividing into the four\r\nzoospores. (After Juranyi.)]\r\n\r\nBut a more striking advance is the fact that the fertilized egg does\r\nnot produce the vegetative thread of œdogonium directly, but first\r\nforms four zoospores, each of which is then capable of developing into\r\nthe thread. On the other hand we found that in spirogyra the zygospore\r\ndevelops directly into the thread form of the plant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 153. Tuft of chætophora, natural size.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 154. Portion of chætophora showing branching.]\r\n\r\n=320. Position of œdogonium.=—Œdogonium is one of the true\r\nthread-like algæ, green in color, and the threads are divided into\r\ndistinct cells. It, along with many relatives, was once placed\r\nin the old genus conferva. These are all now placed in the group\r\n_Confervoideæ_, that is, the _conferva-like algæ_.\r\n\r\n=321. Relatives of œdogonium.=—Many other genera are related\r\nto œdogonium. Some consist of simple threads, and others of branched\r\nthreads. An example of the branched forms is found in chætophora,\r\nrepresented in figures 153, 154. This plant grows in quiet pools or\r\nin slow-running water. It is attached to sticks, rocks, or to larger\r\naquatic plants. Many threads spring from the same point of attachment\r\nand radiate in all directions. This, together with the branching of the\r\nthreads, makes a small, compact, greenish, rounded mass, which is held\r\nfirmly together by a gelatinous substance. The masses in this species\r\nare about the size of a small pea, or smaller. Growth takes place in\r\nchætophora at the ends of the threads and branches. That is, growth is\r\napical. This, together with the branched threads and the tendency to\r\nform cell masses, is a great advance of the vegetative condition of the\r\nplant upon that which we find in the simple threads of œdogonium.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nCOLEOCHÆTE.\r\n\r\n\r\n=322.= Among the green algæ coleochæte is one of the most\r\ninteresting. Several species are known in this country. One of these at\r\nleast should be examined if it is possible to obtain it. It occurs in\r\nthe water of fresh lakes and ponds, attached to aquatic plants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 155. Stem of aquatic plant showing coleochæte,\r\nnatural size.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 156. Thallus of Coleochæte scutata.]\r\n\r\n=323. The shield-shaped coleochæte.=—This plant (C. scutata) is\r\nin the form of a flattened, circular, green plate, as shown in fig.\r\n156. It is attached near the center on one side to rushes and other\r\nplants, and has been found quite abundantly for several years in the\r\nwaters of Cayuga Lake at its southern extremity. As will be seen it\r\nconsists of a single layer of green cells which radiate from the center\r\nin branched rows to the outside, the cells lying so close together as\r\nto form a continuous plate. The plant started its growth from a single\r\ncell at the central point, and grew at the margin in all directions.\r\nSometimes they are quite irregular in outline, when they lie quite\r\nclosely side by side and interfere with one another by pressure. If the\r\nsurface is examined carefully there will be found long hairs, the base\r\nof which is enclosed in a narrow sheath. It is from this character that\r\nthe genus takes its name of coleochæte (sheathed hair).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 157. Portion of thallus of Coleochæte scutata,\r\nshowing empty cells from which zoogonidia have escaped, one from each\r\ncell; zoogonidia at the left. (After Pringsheim.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 158. Portion of thallus of Coleochæte scutata,\r\nshowing four antheridia formed from one thallus cell; a single\r\nspermatozoid at the right. (After Pringsheim.)]\r\n\r\n=324. Fruiting stage of coleochæte.=—It is possible at some\r\nseasons of the year to find rounded masses of cells situated near the\r\nmargin of this green disk. These have developed from a fertilized egg\r\nwhich remained attached to the plant, and probably by this time the\r\nparent plant has lost its color.\r\n\r\n=325. Zoospore stage.=—This mass of tissue does not develop\r\ndirectly into the circular green disk, but each of the cells forms a\r\nzoospore. Here then, as in œdogonium, we have another stage of the\r\nplant interpolated between the fertilized egg and that stage of the\r\nplant which bears the gametes. But in coleochæte we have a distinct\r\nadvance in this stage upon what is present in œdogonium, for in\r\ncoleochæte the fertilized egg develops first into a several-celled mass\r\nof tissue before the zoospores are formed, while in œdogonium only four\r\nzoospores are formed directly from the egg.\r\n\r\n=326. Asexual reproduction.=—In asexual reproduction any of the\r\ngreen cells on the plant may form zoogonida. The contents of a cell\r\nround off and form a single zoogonidium which has two cilia at the\r\nsmaller end of the oval body, fig. 157. After swimming around for a\r\ntime they come to rest, germinate, and produce another plant.\r\n\r\n=327. Sexual reproduction.—Oogonium.=—The oogonium is formed by\r\nthe enlargement of a cell at the end of one of the threads, and then\r\nthe end of the cell elongates into a slender tube which opens at the\r\nend to form a channel through which the spermatozoid may pass down to\r\nthe egg. The egg is formed of the contents of the cell (fig. 159).\r\nSeveral oogonia are formed on one plant, and in such a plant as C.\r\nscutata they are formed in a ring near the margin of the disk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 159. Coleochæte soluta; at left branch bearing\r\noogonium (_oog_); antheridia (_ant_); egg in oogonium and surrounded\r\nby enveloping threads; at center three antheridia open, and one\r\nspermatozoid; at right sporocarp, mature egg inside sporocarp wall.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 160. Two sporocarps still surrounded by thallus.\r\nThallus finally decays and sets sporocarp free.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 161. Sporocarp ruptured by growth of egg to form\r\ncell mass. Cells of this sporophyte forming zoospores.\r\n\r\nFigs. 160, 161. C. scutata.]\r\n\r\n=328. Antheridia.=—In C. scutata certain of the cells of the\r\nplant divide into four smaller cells, and each one of these becomes\r\nan antheridium. In C. soluta the antheridia grow out from the end of\r\nterminal cells in the form of short flasks, sometimes four in number or\r\nless (fig. 159). A single spermatozoid is formed from the contents. It\r\nis oval and possesses two long cilia. After swimming around it passes\r\ndown the tube of the oogonium and fertilizes the egg.\r\n\r\n=329. Sporocarp.=—After the egg is fertilized the cells of the\r\nthreads near the egg grow up around it and form a firm covering one\r\ncell in thickness. This envelope becomes brown and hard, and serves\r\nto protect the egg. This is the “fruit” of the coleochæte, and is\r\nsometimes called a sporocarp (spore-fruit). The development of the cell\r\nmass and the zoospores from the egg has been described above.\r\n\r\nSome of the species of coleochæte consist of branched threads, while\r\nothers form circular cushions several layers in thickness. These forms\r\ntogether with the form of our plant C. scutata make an interesting\r\nseries of transitional forms from filamentous structures to an expanded\r\nplant body formed of a mass of cells.\r\n\r\n=330.

XVIII.\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION AND ADDITIONAL STUDIES OF THE ALGÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to show the general relationship of the algæ studied, the\r\nprincipal classes are here enumerated as well as some of the families.\r\nIn some of the groups not represented by the examples studied above, a\r\nfew species are described which may serve as the basis of additional\r\nstudies if desired. The principal classes[17] of algæ are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nClass Chlorophyceæ.\r\n\r\n=331.= These are the green algæ, so called because the chlorophyll\r\ngreen is usually not masked by other pigments, though in some forms it\r\nis. There are three subclasses.\r\n\r\n=332. Subclass PROTOCOCCOIDEÆ.=—In the Protococcoideæ are found\r\nthe simplest green plants. Many of them consist of single cells which\r\nlive an independent life. Others form “colonies,” loose aggregations\r\nof individuals not yet having attained the permanency of even a simple\r\nplant body, for the cells often separate readily and are able to form\r\nnew colonies. The colonies are often held together by a gelatinous\r\nmembrane, or matrix. Some are motile, while others are non-motile. A\r\nfew of the families are here enumerated.\r\n\r\n=333. Family Volvocaceæ.=—These are all motile, during the\r\nvegetative stage. The individuals are single or form more or less\r\nglobose colonies.\r\n\r\n=334. The “red snow” plant (Sphærella nivalis).=—This is often\r\nfound in arctic and alpine regions forming a red covering over more or\r\nless large areas of snow or ice. For this reason it is called the “red\r\nsnow plant.”\r\n\r\n=335. Sphærella lacustris=, a closely related species, is very\r\nwidely distributed in temperate regions along streams or on the borders\r\nof lakes and ponds. Here in dry weather it is often found closely\r\nadhering to the dry rock surface, and giving it a reddish color as\r\nif the rock were painted. This is especially the case in the shallow\r\nbasins formed over the uneven surface of the rock near the water’s\r\nedge. These places during heavy rains or in high water are provided\r\nwith sufficient water to fill the basins. During such times the red\r\nsnow plant grows and multiplies, loses its red color and becomes green,\r\nand, being motile, is free swimming. It is a single-celled plant,\r\noval in form, surrounded by a gelatinous sheath and with two cilia or\r\nflagella at the smaller end, by the vibration of which it moves (fig.\r\n162). The single cell multiplies by dividing into two cells. When the\r\nwater dries out of the basin, the motile plant comes to rest, and many\r\nof the cells assume the red color. To obtain the plant for study,\r\nscrape some of the red covering from these rock basins and place it in\r\nfresh spring water, and in a day or so the swarmers are likely to be\r\nfound. Under certain conditions small microzoids are formed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 162.\r\n\r\nSphærella lacustris (Girod.)

(After Hazen.)]\r\n\r\n=336. Chlamydomonas= is a very interesting genus of motile\r\none-celled green algæ, because the species are closely related to\r\nthe Flagellates among the lower animals. The plant is oval, with a\r\nsingle chloroplast and surrounded by a gelatinous envelope through\r\nwhich the two cilia or flagella extend. One-celled organisms of this\r\nkind are sometimes called _monads_, i.e., a one-celled being. This\r\none has a gelatinous cloak and is, therefore, a _cloaked monad_\r\n(_Chlamydomonas_). The species often are found as a very thin green\r\nfilm on fresh water. C. pulvisculus is shown in fig. 163. When it\r\nmultiplies the single cell divides into two, as shown in _B_. Sometimes\r\na non-motile palmella stage is formed, as shown in _C_ and _D_.\r\nReproduction takes place by gametes which are of unequal size, the\r\nsmaller one representing the sperm and the larger one the egg, as in\r\n_E_ and _F_. These conjugate as in _G_ and _H_, the protoplasm of the\r\nsmaller one passing over into the larger one, and a zygospore is thus\r\nformed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 163.\r\n\r\n_Chlamydomonas pulvisculus_ (Müll.)

Of those which form colonies=, Pandorina morum is widely\r\ndistributed and not rare. It consists of a sphere formed of sixteen\r\nindividuals enclosed in a thin gelatinous membrane. Each cell possesses\r\ntwo cilia (or flagella), which extend from the broader end out through\r\nthe enveloping membrane. By the movement of these flagella the colony\r\ngoes rolling around in the water. When the plant multiplies each\r\nindividual cell divides into sixteen small cells, which then grow and\r\nform new colonies. Reproduction takes place when the individual cells\r\nof the young colonies separate, and usually a small individual unites\r\nwith a larger one and a zygospore is formed (see fig. 164). Eudorina\r\nelegans is somewhat similar, but when the gametes are formed certain\r\nmother cells divide into sixteen small motile males or sperms, and\r\ncertain other mother cells divide into sixteen large motile females or\r\neggs. These separate from the colonies, and the sperms pair with the\r\neggs and fuse to form zygospores. This plant as well as Chlamydomonas\r\npulvisculus foreshadows the early differentiation of sex in plants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 164.\r\n\r\nPandorina morum (Müll.) Bory.

(After Pringsheim.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 165. Pleurococcus (protococcus) vulgaris.]\r\n\r\n=338. Family Tetrasporaceæ.=—This family is well represented by\r\nTetraspora lubrica forming slimy green net-like sheets attached to\r\nobjects in slow-running water. It is really a single-celled plant. The\r\nrounded cells divide by cross walls into four cells, and these again,\r\nand so on, large numbers being held in loose sheets by the slime in\r\nwhich they are imbedded.\r\n\r\n=339. Family Pleurococcaceæ.=—The members of this family are\r\nall non-motile in the vegetative stage. They consist of single\r\nindividuals, or of colonies. Pleurococcus vulgaris (Protococcus\r\nvulgaris) is a single-celled alga, usually obtained with little\r\ndifficulty. It is often found on the shaded, and cool, or moist side of\r\ntrees, rocks, walls, etc., in damp places. This plant is not motile. It\r\nmultiplies by fission (Fig. 165) into two, then four, etc. These cells\r\nremain united for a time, then separate. Sometimes the cells are found\r\ngrowing out into filaments, and it is thought by some that P. vulgaris\r\nmay be only a simple stage of a higher alga. Eremosphæra viridis is\r\nanother single-celled alga found in fresh water among filamentous\r\nforms. The cells are large and globose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 166.\r\n\r\nPediastrum boryanum. _A_, mature colony, most of the young colonies\r\nhave escaped from their mother cells; at _g_, a young colony is\r\nescaping; _sp_, empty mother cells; _B_, young colony; _C_, same colony\r\nwith spores arranged in order. (After Braun.)]\r\n\r\n=340. Family Hydrodictyaceæ.=—These plants form colonies of\r\ncells. Hydrodictyon reticulatum, the water net, is made up of large\r\nnumbers of cylindrical cells so joined at their ends as to form a large\r\nopen mesh or net. Pediastrum forms circular flat colonies, as shown in\r\nfig. 166. Both of these plants are rather common in fresh-water pools,\r\nthe latter one intermingled with filamentous algæ, while the former\r\nforms large sheets or nets. Multiplication in Hydrodictyon takes place\r\nby the protoplasm in one of the cells dividing into thousands of minute\r\ncells, which gradually arrange themselves in the form of a net, escape\r\ntogether from the mother cell, and grow into a large net. In Pediastrum\r\nmultiplication takes place in a similar way, but the protoplasm in each\r\ncell usually divides into sixteen small cells, and escaping together\r\nfrom the mother cell arrange themselves and grow to full size (fig.\r\n166).\r\n\r\n=341. The Conjugateæ= include several families of green algæ,\r\nwhich probably should be included among the Chlorophyceæ. They have\r\nprobably had their origin from some of the more simple members of the\r\nProtococcoideæ. They are represented by Spirogyra, Zygnema, and the\r\ndesmids, studied in Chapter 14.\r\n\r\n=342. Subclass CONFERVOIDEÆ.=—These are mostly filamentous algæ,\r\nthe filaments being composed of cells firmly united, and, with the\r\nexception of the simplest forms, there is a definite growing point. A\r\nfew of the families are as follows:\r\n\r\n=343. Family Ulvaceæ.=—These contain the sea wracks, or sea\r\nlettuce, like Ulva, forming expanded green, ribbon-like growths in the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 167.\r\n\r\nUlothrix zonata. _A_, base of thread. _B_, cells with zoospores, _C_,\r\none cell with zoospores escaping another cell with small biciliate\r\ngametes escaping and some fusing to form zygospores, _E_, zoospores\r\ngerminating and forming threads: _F_, _G_, zygospore growing and\r\nforming zoospores. (After Caldwell and Dodel-Port.)]\r\n\r\n=344. Family Ulotrichaceæ=, represented by Ulothrix zonata, not\r\nuncommon in slow-running water or in ponds of fresh water attached\r\nto rocks or wood. It consists of simple threads of short cells.\r\nMultiplication takes place by zoospores. Reproduction takes place by\r\nmotile sexual cells (gametes) which fuse to form a zygospore (fig. 167).\r\n\r\n=345. Family Chætophoraceæ=, represented by Chætophora (in Chapter\r\n15) and Drapernaudia in fresh water.\r\n\r\n=346. Family Œdogoniaceæ=, represented by Œdogonium (Chapter 16).\r\n\r\n=347. Family Coleochætaceæ=, represented by Coleochæte (Chapter\r\n17).\r\n\r\n=348. Subclass SIPHONEÆ.=—There are several families.\r\n\r\n=349. Family Botrydiaceæ.=—This is represented by Botrydium\r\ngranulatum (Chapter 15, p. 146).\r\n\r\n=350. Family Vaucheriaceæ=, represented by Vaucheria (Chapter 15),\r\nwith quite a large number of species, is widely distributed.\r\n\r\n\r\nClass Schizophyceæ (= Cyanophyceæ).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 168. Glœocapsa.]\r\n\r\n=351. The Blue-Green Algæ=, or =Cyanophyceæ= form slimy\r\nlooking thin mats on damp wood or the ground, or floating mats or\r\nscum on the water. The color is usually bluish green, but in some\r\nspecies it is purple, red or brown. All have chlorophyll, but it is\r\nnot in distinct chloroplasts and is more or less completely guised\r\nby the presence of other pigments. Two orders and eight families are\r\nrecognized. The following include some of our common forms:\r\n\r\n=352. ORDER COCCOGONALES (COCCOGONEÆ).=—Single-celled plants,\r\noccurring singly or in colonies, in some forms forming short threads.\r\nOne of the two families is mentioned.\r\n\r\n=353. Family Chroococcaceæ.=—The plants multiply only through cell\r\ndivision. Chroococcus, forms rounded, blue-green cells enclosed in a\r\nthick gelatinous coat, in fresh water and in damp places; certain\r\nspecies form “lichen-gonidia” in some genera of lichens. Glœocapsa is\r\nsimilar to Chroococcus, but the colonies are surrounded by an additional\r\ncommon gelatinous envelope (fig. 168); on damp rocks, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 169.\r\n\r\n_A_, Oscillatoria princeps, _a_, terminal cell; _b_, _c_, portions from\r\nthe middle of a filament. In _c_, a dead cell is shown between the\r\nliving cells; _B_, Oscillatoria froelichii, _b_, with granules along\r\nthe partition walls.]\r\n\r\n=354. ORDER HORMOGONALES (HORMOGONEÆ).=—Plants filamentous,\r\nsimple celled or with false or true branching, usually several celled\r\n(Spirulina is single celled). Multiplication takes place through\r\n_hormogones_, short sections of the threads becoming free; also through\r\nresting cells. Two of the six families are mentioned.\r\n\r\n=355. Family Oscillatoriaceæ.=—This family is represented by\r\nthe genus Oscillatoria, and by several other genera common and widely\r\ndistributed. Oscillatoria contains many species. They are found on the\r\ndamp ground or wood, or floating in mats in the water. They often form\r\non the soil at the bottom of the pool, and as gas becomes entangled\r\nin the mat of threads, it is lifted from the bottom and floated to\r\nthe surface of the water. The plant is thread-like, and divided up\r\ninto many short cells. The threads often show an oscillating movement,\r\nwhence the name _Oscillatoria_.\r\n\r\n=356. Family Nostocaceæ.=—This family is represented by Nostoc,\r\nwhich forms rounded, slimy, blue-green masses on wet rocks. The\r\nindividual plants in the slimy ball resemble strings of beads, each\r\ncell being rounded, and several of these arranged in chains as shown\r\nin fig. 170. Here and there are often found larger cells (heterocysts)\r\nin the chain. Nostoc punctiforme lives in the intercellular spaces\r\nof the roots of cycads (often found in greenhouses), and in the\r\nstems of Gunnera. N. sphæricum lives in the spaces between the cells\r\nin many species of liverworts (in the genera Anthoceros, Blasia,\r\nPellia, Aneura, Riccia, etc.), and in the perforated cells of Sphagnum\r\nacutifolium. Anabæna is another common and widely distributed genus.\r\nThe species occur in fresh or salt water, singly or in slimy masses.\r\nAnabæna azollæ lives endophytically in the leaves of the water fern,\r\nAzolla.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 170.\r\n\r\nNostoc linckii. _A_, filament with two heterocysts (_h_), and a large\r\nnumber of spores (_sp_); _B_, isolated spore beginning to germinate;\r\n_C_, young filament developed from spore. (After Bornet.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 171.\r\n\r\nBacteria. _A_, Bacillus subtilis. Spores in threads, unstained rods,\r\nand stained rods showing cilia; _B_, Bacillus tetani, the tetanus\r\nor lockjaw bacillus, found in garden soil and on old rusty nails.\r\nSpores in club-shaped ends. _C_, Micrococcus; _D_, Sarcina; _E_,\r\nStreptococcus; _F_, Spirillum. (After Migula.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nClass Schizomycetes.\r\n\r\n=357. Bacteriales.=—The bacteria are sometimes classified\r\nwith the Cyanophyceæ, under the name Schizophyta, and represent the\r\nsubdivision Schizomycetes, or fission fungi, because many of them\r\nmultiply by a division of the cells just as the blue-green algæ do.\r\nFor example, Bacillus forms rods which increase in length and divide\r\ninto two rods, or it may grow into a long thread of many short rods.\r\nMicrococcus consists of single rounded cells. Streptococcus forms\r\nchains of rounded cells, Sarcina forms irregular cubes of rounded\r\ncells, while others like Spirillum are spiral in form. Bacillus\r\nsubtilis may be obtained by making an infusion from hay and allowing\r\nit to stand for several days. Bacillus tetani occurs in the soil, on\r\nold rusty nails, etc. It is called the tetanus bacillus because it\r\ncauses a permanent spasm of certain muscles, as in “lockjaw.” This\r\nbacillus grows and produces this result on the muscles when it occurs\r\nin deep and closed wounds such as are caused by stepping on an old nail\r\nor other object which pierces the flesh deeply. In such a deep wound\r\noxygen is deficient, and in this condition the bacillus is virulent.\r\nOpening the wounds to admit oxygen and washing them out with a solution\r\nof bichloride of mercury prevents the tetanus. Many bacteria are of\r\ngreat importance in bringing about the decay of dead animal and plant\r\nmatter, returning it to a condition for plant food. (See also nitrate\r\nand nitrite bacteria, Chapter IX.) While most bacteria are harmless\r\nthere are many which cause very serious diseases of man and animals,\r\nas typhoid fever, diphtheria, tuberculosis, etc., while some others\r\nproduce disease in plants. Others aid in certain fermentations of\r\nliquids and are employed for making certain kinds of wines or other\r\nbeverages. Some work in symbiosis with yeasts, as in the kephir yeast,\r\nused in fermenting certain crude beverages by natives of some countries.\r\n\r\n=357=_a_. =Myxobacteriales (Myxobacteriaceæ\r\nThaxter[18]).=—These plants consist of colonies of bacteria-like\r\norganisms, motile rods, which multiply by cross-division and secrete\r\na gelatinous substance or matrix which surrounds the colonies. They\r\nform plasmodium-like masses which superficially resemble the slime\r\nmoulds. In the fruiting stage some species become elevated from the\r\nsubstratum into cylindrical, clavate, or branched forms, which bear\r\ncysts of various shapes containing the rods in a resting stage, or the\r\nrods are converted into spore-like masses. Ex., Chondromyces crocatus\r\non decaying plant parts, Myxobacter aureus on wet wood and bark,\r\nMyxococcus rubescens on dung, decaying lichens, paper, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nClass Flagellata.\r\n\r\n=358. The flagellates= are organisms of very low organization\r\nresembling animals as much as they do plants. They are single celled\r\nand possess two cilia or flagella, by the vibration of which they\r\nmove. Some are without a cell wall, while others have a well-defined\r\nmembrane, but it rarely consists of cellulose. Some have chromatophores\r\nand are able to manufacture carbohydrates like ordinary green plants.\r\nThese are green in Euglena, and brown in Hydrurus. Some possess a\r\nmouth-like opening and are able to ingest solid particles of food\r\n(more like animals), while others have no such opening and absorb food\r\nsubstances dissolved in water (more like plants). The Euglena viridis\r\nis not uncommon in stagnant water, often forming a greenish film on the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\r\nClass Peridineæ.\r\n\r\n=358=_a_. These are peculiar one-celled organisms provided with\r\ntwo flagella and show some relationship to the Flagellates. They\r\nusually are provided with a cellulose membrane, which in some forms\r\nconsists of curiously sculptured plates. In the higher forms this\r\ncellulose membrane consists of two valves fitting together in such a\r\nway as to resemble some of the diatoms. Like the Flagellates, some\r\nhave green chromatophores, which in some are obscured by a yellow or\r\nbrown pigment (resembling the diatoms), while still others have no\r\nchlorophyll. The Peridineæ are abundant in the sea, while some are\r\nfound in fresh water.\r\n\r\n\r\nClass Diatomaphyceæ (Bacillariales, Diatomaceæ).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 171_a_.\r\n\r\nA group of Diatoms: _c_ and _d_, top and side views of the same form;\r\n_e_, colony of stalked forms attached to an alga; _f_ and _g_, top and\r\nside views of the form shown at _e_; _h_, a colony; _i_, a colony, the\r\ntop and side view shown at _k_ and _n_, forming auxospores. (After\r\nKerner.)]\r\n\r\n=358=_b_. =The diatoms= are minute and peculiar organisms\r\nbelieved to be algæ. They live in fresh, brackish, and salt water. They\r\nare often found covering the surface of rocks, sticks, or the soil\r\nin thin sheets. They occur singly and free, or several individuals\r\nmay be joined into long threads, or other species may be attached to\r\nobjects by slender gelatinous stalks. Each protoplast is enclosed in a\r\nsilicified skeleton in the form of a box with two halves, often shaped\r\nlike an old-fashioned pill box, one half fitting over the other like\r\nthe lid of a box. It is evident that in this condition the plant cannot\r\nincrease much in size.\r\n\r\nThey multiply by fission. This takes place longitudinally, i.e., in the\r\ndirection of the two halves or _valves_ of the box. Each new plant then\r\nhas a valve only on one side. A new valve is now formed over the naked\r\nhalf, and fits inside the old valve. At each division the individuals\r\nthus become smaller and smaller until they reach a certain point, when\r\nthe valves are cast off and the cell forms an _auxospore_, i.e., it\r\ngrows alone, or after conjugation with another, to the full size again,\r\nand eventually provides itself with new valves. The valves are often\r\nmarked, with numerous and fine lines, often making beautiful figures,\r\nand some are used for test objects for microscopes.\r\n\r\nThe free forms are capable of movement. The movement takes place in the\r\nlongitudinal direction of the valves. They glide for some time in one\r\ndirection, and then stop and move back again. It is not a difficult\r\nthing to mount them in fresh water and observe this movement.\r\n\r\nThe diatoms have small chlorophyll plates, but the green color is\r\ndisguised by a brownish pigment called diatomin. The relationships of\r\nthe diatoms are uncertain, but some, because of the color, think they\r\nare related to the Phæophyceæ.\r\n\r\n\r\nClass Phæophyceæ.\r\n\r\n=359. The brown algæ. (Phæophyceæ).=—The members of this class\r\npossess chlorophyll, but it is obscured by a brown pigment. The plants\r\nare accessible at the seashore, and for inland laboratories may be\r\npreserved in formalin (2½ per cent). (See also Chapter LVI.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 172.\r\n\r\n_A_, Ectocarpus siliculosus; _B_, branch with a young and a ripe\r\nplurilocular sporangium; _E_, gametes fusing to form zygospore, (_B_,\r\nafter Thuret; _E_, after Berthold.)]\r\n\r\n=360. Ectocarpus.=—The genus Ectocarpus represents well some\r\nof the simpler forms of the brown algæ (fig. 172). They are slender,\r\nfilamentous branched algæ growing in tufts, either epiphytic on other\r\nmarine algæ (often on Fucaceæ), or on stones. The slender threads are\r\nonly divided crosswise, and thus consist of long series of short cells.\r\nThe sporangia are usually plurilocular (sometimes unilocular), and\r\nusually occur in the place of lateral branches. The zoospores escape\r\nfrom the apex of the sporangium and are biciliate, and they fuse to\r\nform zygospores.\r\n\r\n=361. Sphacelaria.=—The species of this genus represent an\r\nadvance in the development of the thallus. While they are filamentous\r\nand branched, division takes place longitudinally as well as crosswise\r\n(fig. 173).\r\n\r\n=362. Leathesia difformis= represents an interesting type because\r\nthe plant body is small, globose, later irregular and hollow, and\r\nconsists of short radiately arranged branches, the surface ones in the\r\nform of short, crowded, but free, trichome-like green branches. This\r\ntrichothallic body recalls the similar form of Chætophora pisiformis\r\n(Chapter 16) among the Chlorophyceæ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 173. Sphacelaria, portion of plant showing\r\nlongitudinal division of cells, and brood bud (plurilocular\r\nsporangium).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 174. Laminaria digitata, forma cloustoni, North\r\nSea. (Reduced.)]\r\n\r\n=363. The Giant Kelps.=—Among the brown algæ are found the\r\nlargest specimens, some of the laminarias or giant kelps, rivaling in\r\nsize the largest land plants, and some of them have highly developed\r\ntissues. _Postelsia palmæformis_ has a long, stout stem, from the\r\nfree end of which extend numerous large and long blades, while the\r\nstem is attached to the rocks by numerous “root” like outgrowths, the\r\nholdfasts. It occurs along the northern Pacific coast, and appears to\r\nflourish where it receives the shock of the surf beating on the shore.\r\nSeveral species of Laminaria occur on our north Atlantic coast. In L.\r\ndigitata, the stem expands at the end into a broad blade, which becomes\r\nsplit into several smaller blades (fig. 174). _Macrocystis pyrifera_\r\ninhabits the ocean in the southern hemisphere, and sometimes is found\r\nalong the north American coast. It is said to reach a length of 200-300\r\nmeters.\r\n\r\n=364. Fucus, or Rockweed.=—This plant is a more or less branched\r\nand flattened thallus or “frond.” One of them, illustrated in fig. 119,\r\nmeasures 15-30 _cm_ (6-12 inches) in length. It is attached to rocks\r\nand stones which are more or less exposed at low tide. From the base\r\nof the plant are developed several short and more or less branched\r\nexpansions called “holdfasts,” which, as their name implies, are organs\r\nof attachment. Some species (F. vesiculosus) have vesicular swellings\r\nin the thallus.\r\n\r\nThe fruiting portions are somewhat thickened as shown in the figure.\r\nWithin these portions are numerous oval cavities opening by a circular\r\npore, which gives a punctate appearance to these fruiting cushions.\r\nTufts of hairs frequently project through them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 175. Portion of plant of Fucus showing conceptacles\r\nin enlarged ends; and below the vesicles (Fucus vesiculosus).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 176. Section of conceptacle of Fucus, showing\r\noogonia, and tufts of antheridia.]\r\n\r\n=365. Structure of the conceptacles.=—On making sections of the\r\nfruiting portions one finds the walls of the cavities covered with\r\noutgrowths. Some of these are short branches which bear a large rounded\r\nterminal sac, the oogonium, at maturity containing eight egg-cells.\r\nMore slender and much-branched threads bear narrowly oval antheridia.\r\nIn these are developed several two-ciliated spermatozoids.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 177. Oogonium of Fucus with ripe eggs.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 178. Antheridia of Fucus, on branched threads.]\r\n\r\n=366. Fertilization.=—At maturity the spermatozoids and egg-cells\r\nfloat outside of the oval cavities, where fertilization takes place.\r\nThe spermatozoid sinks into the protoplasm of the egg-cell, makes its\r\nway to the nucleus of the egg, and fuses with it as shown in fig. 181.\r\nThe fertilized egg then grows into a new plant. Nearly all the brown\r\nalgæ are marine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 179. Antheridia of Fucus with escaping\r\nspermatozoids.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 180. Eggs of Fucus surrounded by spermatozoids.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 181.\r\n\r\nFertilization in Fucus; _fn_, female nucleus; _mn_, male nucleus;\r\n_n_, nucleolus. In the left figure the male nucleus is shown moving\r\ndown through the cytoplasm of the egg; in the remaining figures the\r\ncytoplasm of the egg is omitted. (After Strasburger.)]\r\n\r\n=367. The Gulf weed= (=Sargassum bacciferum=) in the warmer\r\nAtlantic ocean unites in great masses which float on the water, whence\r\ncomes the name “Sargassum Sea.” The Sargassum grows on the coast where\r\nit is attached to the rocks, but the beating of the waves breaks many\r\nspecimens loose and these float out into the more quiet waters, where\r\nthey continue to grow and multiply vegetatively.\r\n\r\n=368. Uses.=—Laminaria japonica and L. angustata are used as food\r\nby the Chinese and Japanese. Some species of the Laminariaceæ are used\r\nas food for cattle and are also used for fertilizers, while L. digitata\r\nis sometimes employed in surgery.\r\n\r\n_Classification._—Kjellman divides the Phæophyceæ into two orders.\r\n\r\n=369. Order Phæosporales (Phæosporeæ)= including 18 families.\r\nOne of the most conspicuous families is the Laminariaceæ, including\r\namong others the Giant Kelps mentioned above (Laminaria, Postelsia,\r\nMacrocystis, etc.).\r\n\r\n=370. Order Cyclosporales (Cyclosporeæ).=—This includes one\r\nfamily, the _Fucaceæ_ with Ectocarpus, Sphacelaria, Læathesia, Fucus,\r\nSargassum, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nClass Rhodophyceæ.\r\n\r\n=371. The red algæ (Rhodophyceæ).=—The larger number of the\r\nso-called red algæ occur in salt water, though a few genera occur in\r\nfresh water. The plants possess chlorophyll, but it is usually obscured\r\nby a reddish or purple pigment.\r\n\r\n=372. Nemalion.=—This is one of the lower marine forms, though\r\nits thallus is not one of the simplest in structure. The plant body\r\nconsists of a slender cylindrical branched shoot, sometimes very\r\nprofusely branched. The central strand is rather firm, while the cortex\r\nis composed of rather loose filaments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 182.\r\n\r\nA red alga (Nemalion). _A_, sexual branches, showing antheridia (_a_);\r\ncarpogonium or procarp (_o_) with its trichogyne (_t_), to which are\r\nattached two spermatia (_s_); _B_, beginning of a cystocarp (_o_),\r\nthe trichogyne (_t_) still showing; _C_, an almost mature cystocarp\r\n(_o_), with the disorganizing trichogyne (_t_). (After Vines.)]\r\n\r\n=373. Batrachospermum.=—This genus occurs in fresh water, and the\r\nspecies are found in slow-running water of shallow streams or ditches.\r\nThere is a central slender strand which is more or less branched,\r\nand on these branches are whorls of densely crowded slender branches\r\noccurring at regular intervals. The plants are usually very slippery.\r\nGonidia are formed on the ends of some of these branches in globose\r\nsporangia, called monosporangia, since but a single spore or gonidium\r\nis developed in each. Other branches often terminate in long slender\r\nhyaline setæ.\r\n\r\n=374. Lemanea.=—This genus also occurs in fresh water. The\r\nspecies develop only during the cold winter months in rapids of streams\r\nor where the water from falls strikes the rocks and is thoroughly\r\naerated. They form tufts of greenish threads, cylindrical or whiplike,\r\nwhich in the summer are usually much broken down. The threads are\r\nhollow and have a firm cortex. These are the sexual shoots, and they\r\narise as branches from a sterile filamentous-branched, Chantransia-like\r\nform.\r\n\r\n=375. Fertilization in the lower red algæ.=—The sexual organs in\r\nthe red algæ consist of antheridia and carpogonia. The antheridia are\r\nusually borne in crowded clusters, or surfaces, and bear terminally\r\nthe small non-motile sperm cells. The carpogonium is a branch of one\r\nor several cells, the terminal cell (procarp) extending into a long\r\nslender process, the trichogyne. The sperm cell comes in contact with\r\nthe trichogyne, and in the case of Nemalion and some others the nucleus\r\nhas been found to pass down the inside and fuse with the nucleus of the\r\nprocarp.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 183.\r\n\r\n_A_, part of a shoot showing whorls of branches with clusters of\r\ncarpospores. _B_, carpogonic branch or procarp. _c_, procarp cell;\r\n_tr_, trichogyne. _C_, same with sperm (_sp_) uniting with trichogyne.\r\n_D_, same with carpospores developing from procarp cell. _E_, male\r\nbranch with one-celled antheridia. _F_, same with some of antheridia\r\nempty. (After Schmitz.)]\r\n\r\nFrom this point in the lower red algæ like Nemalion, Batrachospermum\r\nand Lemanea the formation of the spores is very simple. The procarp\r\nis stimulated to growth, and buds in different directions, producing\r\nbranched chains of spores (carpospores). The carpospores form a rather\r\ncompact cluster called the sporocarp, which means spore-fruit or\r\nspore-fruit body. In Batrachospermum it is seen as a compact tuft in\r\nthe loose branching, in Nemalion it lies in the surface of the cortex,\r\nwhile in Lemanea the sporocarps lie at different positions in the\r\nhollow tube of the sexual shoot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 184.\r\n\r\nA red alga (Callithamnion), showing sporangium _A_, and the tetraspores\r\ndischarged _B_. (After Thuret.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 185. Gracilaria, portion of frond, showing position\r\nof cystocarps.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 186. Gracilaria, section of cystocarp showing\r\nspores.]\r\n\r\n=376. Gonidia in the red algæ.=—The common type of gonidium\r\nin the red algæ is found in the _tetraspores_. A single mother cell\r\ndivides into four cells arranged usually in the form of tetrads within\r\nthe _tetrasporangium_. In Callithamnion the tetrasporangium is exposed.\r\nIn Polysiphonia, Rhabdonia, Gracilaria, etc., it is imbedded in the\r\ncortex. In Batrachospermum there are monosporangia, each monosporangium\r\ncontaining a single gonidium, while in Lemanea, and according to some\r\nalso in Nemalion, gonidia are wanting.\r\n\r\n=377. Gracilaria.=—Gracilaria is one of the marine forms, and\r\none species is illustrated in fig. 185. It measures 15-20_cm_ or more\r\nlong, and is profusely branched in a palmate manner. The parts of the\r\nthallus are more or less flattened. The fruit is a cystocarp, which\r\nis characteristic of the Rhodophyceæ (Florideæ). In Gracilaria these\r\nfruit bodies occur scattered over the thallus. They are somewhat\r\nflask-shaped, are partly sunk in the thallus, and the conical end\r\nprojects strongly above the surface. The carpospores are grouped in\r\nradiating threads within the oval cavity of the cystocarp. These\r\ncystocarps are developed as a result of fertilization. Other plants\r\nbear gonidia in groups of four, the so-called _tetraspores_.\r\n\r\n=378. Rhabdonia.=—This plant is about the same size as the\r\ngracilaria, though it possesses more filiform branches. The cystocarps\r\nform prominent elevations, while the carpospores lie in separated\r\ngroups around the periphery of a sterile tissue within the cavity. (See\r\nfigs. 187, 188.) Gonidia in the form of tetraspores are also developed\r\nin Rhabdonia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 187. Rhabdonia, branched portion of frond showing\r\ncystocarps.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 188. Section of cystocarp of rhabdonia, showing\r\nspores.]\r\n\r\n=379. Fertilization of the higher red algæ.=—The process of\r\nfertilization in most of the red algæ is very complicated, chiefly\r\nbecause the fertilized egg-cell (procarp) does not develop the spores\r\ndirectly, as in Nemalion, Lemanea, etc., but fuses directly, or by a\r\nshort cell or long filament with one or more auxiliary cells before\r\nthe sporocarp is finally formed. Examples are Rhabdonia, Polysiphonia,\r\nCallithamnion, Dudresnaya, etc. (fig. 189). The auxiliary cell then\r\ndevelops the sporocarp. See fig. 189 for conjugation of a filament from\r\nthe fertilized procarp with an auxiliary cell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 189.\r\n\r\nDudresnaya purpurifera. _tr_, trichogyne, with spermatozoids attached;\r\n_ct_, connecting-tube which grows out from below the base of the\r\ntrichogyne, and comes in contact with the fertile branches _f_, _f_;\r\n_ct′_, young connecting-tube. (After Thuret and Bornet.)]\r\n\r\n=380. Uses of the red algæ.=—Many species produce a great amount\r\nof gelatinous substance in their tissues, and several of these are used\r\nfor food, for the manufacture of gelatines and agar-agar. Some of these\r\nare Gracilaria lichenoides and wrightii, the former species occurring\r\nalong the coast of India and China. The plant is easily converted into\r\ngelatinous substance (agar-agar). Chondrus crispus, widely distributed\r\nin the northern Atlantic is known as “Irish” moss and is used for food\r\nand for certain medicinal purposes. Gigartina mamillosa in the Atlantic\r\nand Arctic oceans is similarly employed. The following orders are\r\nrecognized in the red algæ:\r\n\r\n=381. Order Bangiales.=—Example, Bangia atropurpurea (= Conferva\r\natropurpurea) in springs and brooks in North America and Europe.\r\nPorphyra contains a number of species forming broad, thin, leaf-like\r\npurple sheets in the sea.\r\n\r\n=382. Order Nemalionales.=—Including Lemanea, Batrachospermum,\r\nNemalion, described above, and many others.\r\n\r\n=383. Order Gigartinales.=—In this order occurs the common\r\nIceland moss (Chondrus crispus) in the sea, and Rhabdonia and Gigartina\r\nmentioned above.\r\n\r\n=384. Order Rhodomeniales.=—In this order occurs Gracilaria and\r\nPolysiphonia mentioned above, also the beautiful marine forms like\r\nCeramium.\r\n\r\n=385. Order Cryptonemiales.=—Examples are Dudresnaya, Melobesia,\r\nCorallina, etc., the last two genera include many species with a wide\r\ndistribution.\r\n\r\n\r\nClass Charophyceæ, Order Charales.\r\n\r\n=386.= The Charales are by some thought to represent a distinct\r\nclass of algæ standing near the mosses, perhaps, because of the\r\nbiciliate character of the spermatozoids. There is one family, the\r\nCharaceæ. The plants occur in fresh and brackish water. Aside from the\r\npeculiarity of the reproductive organs they are remarkable for the\r\nlarge size of the cells of the internodes and of the “leaves,” and the\r\nprotoplasm exhibits to a remarkable degree the phenomenon of “cyclosis”\r\n(see paragraphs 17-20). Three of the genera are found in North America\r\n(Chara, Nitella (Fig. 8) and Tolypella).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 172_a_.\r\n\r\nReproductive organs of _Chara fragilis_. _A_, a central portion of a\r\nleaf, _b_, with an antheridium, _a_, and a carpogonium, _s_, surrounded\r\nby the spirally twisted enveloping cells; _c_, crown of five cells at\r\napex; β, sterile lateral leaflets; β′, large lateral leaflet near the\r\nfruit; β″, bracteoles springing from the basal node of the reproductive\r\norgans. _B_, a young antheridium, _a_, and a young carpogonium, _sk_;\r\n_w_, nodal cell of leaf; _u_, intermediate cell between _w_ and the\r\nbasal-node cell of the antheridium; _l_, cavity of the internode of\r\nthe leaf; _br_, cortical cells of the leaf. _A_ × about 33; _B_ × 240.\r\n(After Sachs.)]\r\n\r\n=386a.= The complicated structure of the sexual organs shows a\r\nhigher state of organization than any of the other living algæ known.\r\nWhile the internodes in Nitella are composed of a single, stout cell,\r\nsome times a foot or more in length, the nodes in all are composed of\r\na group of smaller cells. From the lateral cells of this group lateral\r\naxes (sometimes called leaves) arise in whorls.\r\n\r\nIn Nitella the internodes are naked, but in most species of Chara\r\nthey are _corticated_, i.e., they are covered by a layer of numerous\r\nelongated cells which grow downward from the nodes at the base of the\r\nwhorl of lateral shoots.\r\n\r\n=386b.= The sexual organs are situated at the nodes of the whorled\r\nlateral shoots, and consist of antheridia and carpogonia. Most of the\r\nplants are monœcious, and both antheridia and carpogonia are often\r\nattached to the same node, the antheridium projecting downward while\r\nthe carpogonium is more or less ascending. The sexual organs are\r\nvisible to the unaided eye. The antheridium is a globose red body of\r\nan exceedingly complicated structure. The sperms are borne in several\r\nvery long coiled slender threads which are divided transversely into\r\nnumerous cells. The carpogonium is oval or elliptical in outline, the\r\nwall of which is composed of several closely coiled spiral threads\r\nenclosing the large egg.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[17] In Engler & Prantl’s Pflanzenfamilien, Wille uses the term class\r\nfor these principal subdivisions of the algæ. Systematists are not yet\r\nagreed upon a uniform use of the terms.\r\n\r\n[18] See Bot. Gaz., 17, 389, 1892.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nFUNGI: MUCOR AND SAPROLEGNIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nMucor.\r\n\r\n=387.= In the chapter on growth, and in our study of protoplasm,\r\nwe have become familiar with the vegetative condition of mucor. We now\r\nwish to learn how the plant multiplies and reproduces itself. For this\r\nstudy we may take one of the mucors. Any one of several species will\r\nanswer. This plant may be grown by placing partially decayed fruits,\r\nlemons, or oranges, from which the greater part of the juice has been\r\nremoved, in a moist chamber; or often it occurs on animal excrement\r\nwhen placed under similar conditions. In growing the mucor in this way\r\nwe are likely to obtain Mucor mucedo, or another plant sometimes known\r\nas Mucor stolonifer, or Rhizopus nigricans, which is illustrated in\r\nfig. 191. This latter one is sometimes very injurious to stored fruits\r\nor vegetables, especially sweet potatoes or rutabagas. Fig. 190 is from\r\na photograph of this fungus on a banana.\r\n\r\n=388. Asexual reproduction.=—On the decaying surface of the\r\nvegetable matter where the mucor is growing there will be seen numerous\r\nsmall rounded bodies borne on very slender stalks. These heads contain\r\nthe gonidia, and if we sow some of them in nutrient gelatine or agar\r\nin a Petrie dish the material can be taken out very readily for\r\nexamination under the microscope. Or we may place glass slips close\r\nto the growing fungus in the moist chamber, so that the fungus will\r\ndevelop on them, though cultures in a nutrient medium are much better.\r\nOr we may take the material directly from the substance on which it is\r\ngrowing. After mounting a small quantity of the mycelium bearing these\r\nheads, if we have been careful to take it where the heads appear\r\nquite young, it may be possible to study the early stages of their\r\ndevelopment. We shall probably note at once that the stalks or upright\r\nthreads which support the heads are stouter than the threads of the\r\nmycelium.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 190. Portion of banana with a mould (Rhizopus\r\nnigricans) growing on one end.]\r\n\r\nThese upright threads soon have formed near the end a cross wall which\r\nseparates the protoplasm in the end from the remainder. This end cell\r\nnow enlarges into a vesicle of considerable size, the head as it\r\nappears, but to which is applied the name of _sporangium_ (sometimes\r\ncalled gonidangium), because it encloses the _gonidia_.\r\n\r\nAt the same time that this end cell is enlarging the cross wall is\r\narching up into the interior. This forms the _columella_. All the\r\nprotoplasm in the sporangium now divides into gonidia. These are\r\nsmall-rounded or oval bodies. The wall of the sporangium becomes\r\ndissolved, except a small collar around the stalk which remains\r\nattached below the columella (fig. 192). By this means the gonidia are\r\nfreed. These gonidia germinate and produce the mycelium again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 191. Group of sporangia of a mucor (Rhizopus\r\nnigricans) showing rhizoids and the stolon extending from an older\r\ngroup.]\r\n\r\n=389. Sexual stage.=—This stage is not so frequently found, but\r\nmay sometimes be obtained by growing the fungus on bread.\r\n\r\nConjugation takes place in this way. Two threads of the mycelium which\r\nlie near each other put out each a short branch which is clavate in\r\nform. The ends of these branches meet, and in each a septum is formed\r\nwhich cuts off a portion of the protoplasm in the end from that of the\r\nrest of the mycelium. The meeting walls of the branches now dissolve\r\nand the protoplasm of each gamete fuses into one mass. A thick wall\r\nis now formed around this mass, and the outer layer becomes rough and\r\nbrown. This is the _zygote_ or _zygospore_. The mycelium dies and it\r\nbecomes free often with the suspensors, as the stalks of these sexual\r\nbranches are called, still attached. This zygospore passes through\r\na period of rest, when with the entrance of favorable conditions of\r\ngrowth it germinates, and usually produces directly a sporangium with\r\ngonidia. This completes the normal life cycle of the plant.\r\n\r\n=390. Gemmæ.=—Gemmæ, as they are sometimes called, are often\r\nformed on the mycelium. A short cell with a stout wall is formed on the\r\nside of a thread of the mycelium. In other cases large portions of the\r\nthreads of the mycelium may separate into chains of cells. Both these\r\nkinds of cells are capable of growing and forming the mycelium again.\r\nThey are sometimes called _chlamydospores_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 194.\r\n\r\nA mucor (Rhizopus nigricans); at left nearly mature sporangium with\r\ncolumella showing within; in the middle is ruptured sporangium with\r\nsome of the gonidia clinging to the columella; at right two ruptured\r\nsporangia with everted columella.]\r\n\r\n=390=_a_. The Mucorineæ according to their manner of zygospore\r\nformation are of two kinds: 1st, the _homothallic_ (monœcious), in\r\nwhich all of the colonies of thalli developed from different spores\r\nare the same, and both gametes may be developed from the mycelium\r\nfrom a single spore, as in Sporodinia grandis, a mould common on old\r\nmushrooms; 2d, the _heterothallic_ (diœcious), in which certain plants\r\nare of a male nature and small in comparison with those of perhaps a\r\nfemale nature which are larger or more vigorous. When grown separately\r\neach of these two kinds of thalli, or colonies of mycelium, produce\r\ntheir own kind but only sporangia. If the two kinds are brought\r\ntogether, however, branches from one conjugate with branches from\r\nthe other and zygospores are produced, as in Rhizopus nigricans, the\r\ncommon bread or fruit mould. This is one reason why we rarely find this\r\nfungus forming zygospores. (See Blakeslee, Sexual Reproduction in the\r\nMucorineæ, Proc. Am. Acad. Arts and Sci., =40=, 205-319, pl. 1-4,\r\n1904.)\r\n\r\n\r\nWater Moulds (Saprolegnia).\r\n\r\n=391.= The water moulds are very interesting plants to study\r\nbecause they are so easy to obtain, and it is so easy to observe a type\r\nof gonidium here to which we have referred in our studies of the algæ,\r\nthe motile gonidium, or zoogonidium. (See appendix for directions for\r\ncultivating this mould.)\r\n\r\n=392. Appearance of the saprolegnia.=—In the course of a few days\r\nwe are quite certain to see in some of the cultures delicate whitish\r\nthreads, radiating outward from the body of the fly in the water. A few\r\nthreads should be examined from day to day to determine the stage of\r\nthe fungus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 195. Sporangia of saprolegnia, one showing the\r\nescape of the zoogonidia.]\r\n\r\n=393. Sporangia of saprolegnia.=—The sporangia of saprolegnia\r\ncan be easily detected because they are much stouter than the ordinary\r\nthreads of the mycelium. Some of the threads should be mounted in fresh\r\nwater. Search for some of those which show that the protoplasm is\r\ndivided up into a great number of small areas, as shown in fig. 195.\r\nWith the low power we should watch some of the older appearing ones,\r\nand if after a few minutes they do not open, other preparations should\r\nbe made.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 196. Branch of saprolegnia showing oogonia with\r\noospores, eggs matured parthenogenetically.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 197.\r\n\r\nDowny mildew of grape (Plasmopora viticola), showing tuft of\r\ngonidiophores bearing gonidia, also intercellular mycelium. (After\r\nMillardet.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 198. Phytophthora infestans showing peculiar\r\nbranches; gonidia below.]\r\n\r\n=394. Zoogonidia of saprolegnia.=—The sporangium opens at the end, and\r\nthe zoogonidia swirl out and swim around for a short time, when they\r\ncome to rest. With a good magnifying power the two cilia on the end may\r\nbe seen, or we may make them more distinct by treatment with Schultz’s\r\nsolution, drawing some under the cover glass. The zoogonidium is oval\r\nand the cilia are at the pointed end. After they have been at rest for\r\nsome time they often slip out of the thin wall, and swim again, this\r\ntime with the two cilia on the side, and then the zoogonidium is this\r\ntime more or less bean-shaped or reniform.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 199.\r\n\r\nFertilization in saprolegnia, tube of antheridium carrying in the\r\nnucleus of the sperm cell to the egg. In the right-hand figure a\r\nsmaller sperm nucleus is about to fuse with the nucleus of the egg.\r\n(After Humphrey and Trow.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 200. Branching hypha of Peronospora alsinearum.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 201. Branched hypha of downy mildew of grape\r\nshowing peculiar branching (Plasmopara viticola).]\r\n\r\n=395. Sexual reproduction of saprolegnia.=—When such cultures are\r\nolder we often see large rounded bodies either at the end of a thread,\r\nor of a branch, which contain several smaller rounded bodies as shown\r\nin fig. 196. These are the oogonia (unless the plant is attacked by a\r\nparasite), and the round bodies inside are the egg-cells, if before\r\nfertilization, or the eggs, if after this process has taken place.\r\nSometimes the slender antheridium can be seen coiled partly around the\r\noogonium, and one end entering to come in contact with the egg-cell.\r\nBut in some species the antheridium is not present, and that is the\r\ncase with the species figured at 196. In this case the eggs mature\r\nwithout fertilization. This maturity of the egg without fertilization\r\nis called _parthenogenesis_, which occurs in other plants also, but is\r\na rather rare phenomenon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 202.\r\n\r\nGonidiophores and gonidia of potato blight (Phytophthora infestans).\r\n_b_, an older stage showing how the branch enlarges where it grows\r\nbeyond the older gonidium. (After de Bary.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 203. Gonidia of potato blight forming zoogonidia.\r\n(After de Bary.)]\r\n\r\n=396.= In fig. 199 is shown the oogonium and an antheridium,\r\nand the antheridium is carrying in the male nucleus to the egg-cell.\r\nSpermatozoids are not developed here, but a nucleus in the antheridium\r\nreaches the egg-cell. It sinks in the protoplasm of the egg, comes\r\nin contact with the nucleus of the egg, and fuses with it. Thus\r\nfertilization is accomplished.\r\n\r\n\r\nDowny Mildews.\r\n\r\n=397.= The downy mildews make up a group of plants which are\r\nclosely related to the water moulds, but they are parasitic on land\r\nplants, and some species produce very serious diseases. The mycelium\r\ngrows between the cells of the leaves, stems, etc., of their hosts,\r\nand sends haustoria into the cells to take up nutriment. Gonidia are\r\nformed on threads which grow through the stomates to the outside and\r\nbranch as shown in figs. 198-201. The gonidia are borne on the tips\r\nof the branches. The kind of branching bears some relation to the\r\ndifferent genera. Fig. 200 is from Peronospora alsinearum on leaves of\r\ncerastium; figs. 197 and 199 are Plasmopara viticola, the grape mildew,\r\nwhile figs. 198 and 202 are from Phytophthora infestans which causes a\r\ndisease known as potato blight. The gonidia of peronospora germinate\r\nby a germ tube, those of plasmopara first form zoogonidia, while in\r\nphytophthora the gonidium may either germinate forming a thread, or\r\neach gonidium may first form several zoogonidia, as shown in fig. 203.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 204.\r\n\r\nFertilization in Peronospora alsinearum; tube from antheridium carrying\r\nin the sperm nucleus in figure at the left, female nucleus near; fusion\r\nof the two nuclei shown in the two other figures. (After Berlese.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 205. Ripe oospore of Peronospora alsinearum.]\r\n\r\n=398.= In sexual reproduction oogonia and antheridia are developed\r\non the mycelium within the tissues. Fig. 204 represents the antheridium\r\nentering the oogonium, and the male nucleus fusing with the female\r\nnucleus in fertilization. The sexual organs of Phytophthora infestans\r\nare not sufficiently known.\r\n\r\n=399.= Mucor, saprolegnia, peronospora, and their relatives\r\nhave few or no septa in the mycelium. In this respect they resemble\r\ncertain of the algæ like vaucheria, but they lack chlorophyll. They are\r\nsometimes called the alga-like fungi and belong to a large group called\r\n_Phycomycetes_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nFUNGI CONTINUED.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Rusts” (Uredineæ).\r\n\r\n=400.= The fungi known as “rusts” are very important ones to\r\nstudy, since all the species are parasitic, and many produce serious\r\ninjuries to crops.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 206. Wheat leaf with red-rust, natural size.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 207. Portion of leaf enlarged to show sori.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 208. Natural size.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 209. Enlarged.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 210. Single sorus.\r\n\r\nFigs. 206, 207.—Puccinia graminis, red-rust stage (uredo stage).\r\n\r\nFigs. 208-210.—Black rust of wheat, showing sori of teleutospores.]\r\n\r\n=401. Wheat rust (Puccinia graminis).=—The wheat rust is one of\r\nthe best known of these fungi, since a great deal of study has been\r\ngiven to it. One form of the plant occurs in long reddish-brown or\r\nreddish pustules, and is known as the “red-rust” (figs. 206, 207).\r\nAnother form occurs in elongated black pustules, and this form is the\r\none known as the “black rust” (figs. 208-211). These two forms occur on\r\nthe stems, blades, etc., of the wheat, also on oats, rye, and some of\r\nthe grasses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 211. Head of wheat showing black rust spots on the\r\nchaff and awns.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 212. Teleutospores of wheat rust, showing two cells\r\nand the pedicel.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 213. Uredospores of wheat rust, one showing\r\nremnants of the pedicel.]\r\n\r\n=402. Teleutospores of the black rust form.=—If we scrape off\r\nsome portion of one of the black pustules (sori), tease it out in water\r\non a slide, and examine with a microscope, we see numerous gonidia,\r\ncomposed of two cells, and having thick, brownish walls as shown\r\nin fig. 212. Usually there is a slender brownish stalk on one end.\r\nThese gonidia are called _teleutospores_. They are somewhat oblong or\r\nelliptical, a little constricted where the septum separates the two\r\ncells, and the end cell varies from ovate to rounded. The mycelium of\r\nthe fungus courses between the cells, just as is found in the case of\r\nthe carnation rust, which belongs to the same family (see Parag. 186).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 214. Barberry leaf with two diseased spots, natural\r\nsize.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 215. Single spot showing cluster-cups enlarged.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 216. Two cluster-cups more enlarged, showing split\r\nmargin.\r\n\r\nFigs. 214-216.—Cluster-cup stage of wheat rust.]\r\n\r\n=403. Uredospores of the red-rust form.=—If we make a similar\r\npreparation from the pustules of the red-rust form we see that instead\r\nof two-celled gonidia they are one-celled. The walls are thinner\r\nand not so dark in color, and they are covered with minute spines.\r\nThey have also short stalks, but these fall away very easily. These\r\none-celled gonidia of the red-rust form are called “uredospores.” The\r\nuredospores and teleutospores are sometimes found in the same pustule.\r\n\r\nIt was once supposed that these two kinds of gonidia belonged to\r\ndifferent plants, but now it is known that the one-celled form, the\r\nuredospores, is a form developed earlier in the season than the\r\nteleutospores.\r\n\r\n=404. Cluster-cup form on the barberry.=—On the barberry is found\r\nstill another form of the wheat rust, the “_cluster-cup_” stage. The\r\npustules on the under side of the barberry leaf are cup-shaped, the\r\ncups being partly sunk in the tissue of the leaf, while the rim is more\r\nor less curved backward against the leaf, and split at several places.\r\nThese cups occur in clusters on the affected spots of the barberry leaf\r\nas shown in fig. 215. Within the cups numbers of one-celled gonidia\r\n(orange in color, called æcidiospores) are borne in chains from short\r\nbranches of the mycelium, which fill the base of the cup. In fact the\r\nwall of the cup (peridium) is formed of similar rows of cells, which,\r\ninstead of separating into gonidia, remain united to form a wall. These\r\ncups are usually borne on the under side of the leaf.\r\n\r\n=405. Spermagonia.=—Upon the upper side of the leaves in the\r\nsame spot occur small, orange-colored pustules which are flask-shaped.\r\nThey bear inside, minute, rod-like bodies on the ends of slender\r\nthreads, which ooze out on the surface of the leaf. These flask-shaped\r\npustules are called _spermagonia_, and the minute bodies within them\r\n_spermatia_, since they were once supposed to be the male element of\r\nthe fungus. Their function is not known. They appear in the spots at an\r\nearlier time than the cluster-cups.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 217. Section of an æcidium (cluster-cup) from\r\nbarberry leaf. (After Marshall-Ward.)]\r\n\r\n=406. How the cluster-cup stage was found to be a part of the wheat\r\nrust.=—The cluster-cup stage of the wheat rust was once supposed\r\nalso to be a different plant, and the genus was called _æcidium_.\r\nThe occurrence of wheat rust in great abundance on the leeward side\r\nof affected barberry bushes in England suggested to the farmers that\r\nwheat rust was caused by barberry rust. It was later found that the\r\næcidiospores of the barberry, when sown on wheat, germinate and the\r\nthread of mycelium enters the tissues of the wheat, forming mycelium\r\nbetween the cells. This mycelium then bears the uredospores, and later\r\nthe teleutospores.\r\n\r\n=407. Uredospores can produce successive crops of\r\nuredospores.=—The uredospores are carried by the wind to other\r\nwheat or grass plants, germinate, form mycelium in the tissues,\r\nand later the pustules with a second crop of uredospores. Several\r\nsuccessive crops of uredospores may be developed in one season, so\r\nthis is the form in which the fungus is greatly multiplied and widely\r\ndistributed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 218.\r\n\r\nSection through leaf of barberry at point affected with the cluster-cup\r\nstage of the wheat rust; spermagonia above, æcidia below. (After\r\nMarshall-Ward.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 219.\r\n\r\n_A_, section through sorus of black rust of wheat, showing\r\nteleutospores. _B_, mycelium bearing both teleutospores and\r\nuredospores. (After de Bary.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 220. Germinating uredospore of wheat rust. (After\r\nMarshall-Ward.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 221. Germ tube entering the leaf through a stoma.]\r\n\r\n=407a. Teleutospores the last stage of the fungus in the season.=—The\r\nteleutospores are developed late in the season, or late in the\r\ndevelopment of the host plant (in this case the wheat is the host).\r\nThey then rest during the winter. In the spring under favorable\r\nconditions each cell of the teleutospore germinates, producing a\r\nshort mycelium called a _promycelium_, as shown in figs. 222, 223.\r\nThis promycelium is usually divided into four cells. From each cell a\r\nshort, pointed process is formed called a “_sterigma_.” Through this\r\nthe protoplasm moves and forms a small gonidium on the end, sometimes\r\ncalled a _sporidium_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 222. Teleutospore germinating, forming promycelium.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 223. Promycelium of germinating teleutospore,\r\nforming sporidia.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 224. Germinating sporidia entering leaf of barberry\r\nby mycelium.\r\n\r\nFigs. 222-224.—Puccinia graminis (wheat rust). (After Marshall-Ward.)]\r\n\r\n=408. How the fungus gets from the wheat back to the barberry.=—If\r\nthese sporidia from the teleutospores are carried by the wind so that\r\nthey lodge on the leaves of the barberry, they germinate and produce\r\nthe cluster-cup again. The plant has thus a very complex life history.\r\nBecause of the presence of several different forms in the life cyle, it\r\nis called a _polymorphic_ fungus.\r\n\r\nThe presence of the barberry does not seem necessary in all cases for the\r\ndevelopment of the fungus from one year to another.\r\n\r\n=409. Synopsis of life history of wheat rust.=\r\n\r\n_Cluster-cup stage on leaf of barberry._\r\n\r\n    Mycelium between cells of leaf in affected spots.\r\n    Spermagonia (sing. spermagonium), small flask-shaped\r\n        bodies sunk in upper side of leaf; contain “spermatia.”\r\n    Æcidia (sing. æcidium), cup-shaped bodies in under side\r\n        of leaf.\r\n    Wall or peridium, made up of outer layer of fungus\r\n        threads which are divided into short cells but\r\n        remain united.\r\n    At maturity bursts through epidermis of leaf; margin\r\n        of cup curves outward and downward toward surface\r\n        of leaf.\r\n    Central threads of the bundle are closely packed, but\r\n        free. Threads divide into short angular cells\r\n        which separate and become æcidiospores, with\r\n        orange-colored content.\r\n    Æcidiospores carried by the wind to wheat, oats, grasses,\r\n        etc. Here they germinate, mycelium enters at stomate,\r\n        and forms mycelium between cells of the host.\r\n\r\n_Uredo stage (red-rust) on wheat, oats, grasses, etc._\r\n\r\n    Mycelium between cells of host.\r\n    Bears uredospores (1-celled) in masses under epidermis,\r\n        which is later ruptured and uredospores set free.\r\n    Uredospores carried by wind to other individual hosts,\r\n        and new crops of uredospores formed.\r\n\r\n_Teleutospore stage (black rust), also on wheat, etc._\r\n\r\n    Mycelium between cells of host.\r\n    Bears teleutospores (2-celled) in masses (sori) under\r\n        epidermis, which is later ruptured.\r\n    Teleutospores rest during winter. In spring each cell\r\n        germinates and produces a promycelium, a short\r\n        thread, divided into four cells.\r\n    Promycelium bears four sterigmata and four gonidia\r\n        (or sporidia), which in favorable conditions pass\r\n        back to the barberry, germinate, the tube enters\r\n        between cells into the intercellular spaces of the\r\n        host to produce the cluster-cup again, and thus the\r\n        life cycle is completed.\r\n\r\n=410. Other examples of the rusts.=—Some of the rusts do great\r\ninjury to fruit trees and also to forest trees. The “cedar apples” are\r\nabnormal growths on the leaves and twigs of the cedar stimulated by the\r\npresence of the mycelium of a rust known as Gymnosporangium macropus.\r\nThe teleutospores are two-celled and are formed in the tissue of the\r\n“cedar apple” or gall. The teleutosori are situated at quite regular\r\nintervals over the surface of the gall at small circular depressions,\r\nand can be easily seen in late autumn and during the winter. A quantity\r\nof gelatine is developed along with the teleutospores. In early spring\r\nwith the warm spring rains the gelatinous substance accompanying the\r\nteleutospores swells greatly, and causes the teleutospores to ooze\r\nout in long, dull, orange-colored strings, which taper gradually to\r\na slender point and bristle all over the “cedar apple.” Here the\r\nteleutospores germinate and produce the sporidia. The sporidia are\r\ncarried to apple trees where they infect leaves and even the fruit,\r\nproducing here the cluster-cups. There are no uredospores.\r\n\r\nG. globosum is another species forming cedar apples, but the gelatinous\r\nstrings of teleutospores are short and clavate, and the cluster-cups\r\nare formed on hawthorns. G. nidusavis forms “witches brooms” or “birds\r\nnests” in the branches of the cedar. The mycelium in the branches\r\nstimulates them to profuse branching so that numerous small branches\r\nare developed close together. The teleutosori form small pustules\r\nscattered over the branches. G. clavipes affects the branches of cedar\r\nonly slightly deforming them or not at all, and the cluster-cups are\r\nformed on fruits, twigs, and leaves of the hawthorns or quinces, the\r\ncluster-cups being long, tubular, and orange in color.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nTHE HIGHER FUNGI.\r\n\r\n\r\n=411. The series of the higher fungi.=—Of these there are two\r\nlarge series. One of these is represented by the sac fungi, and the\r\nother by the mushrooms, a good example of which is the common mushroom\r\n(Agaricus campestris).\r\n\r\n\r\nSac Fungi (Ascomycetes).\r\n\r\n=412. The sac fungi= may be represented by the “powdery mildews”;\r\nexamples, uncinula, microsphæra, podosphæra, etc. Fig. 225 is from a\r\nphotograph of two willow leaves affected by one of these mildews. The\r\nleaves are first partly covered with a whitish growth of mycelium, and\r\nnumerous chains of colorless gonidia are borne on short erect threads.\r\nThe masses of gonidia give the leaf a powdery appearance. The mycelium\r\nlives on the outer surface of the leaf, but sends short haustoria into\r\nthe epidermal cells.\r\n\r\n=413. Fruit bodies of the willow mildew.=—On this same mycelium\r\nthere appear later numerous black specks scattered over the affected\r\nplaces of the leaf. These are the fruit bodies (_perithecia_). If\r\nwe scrape some of these from the leaf, and mount them in water for\r\nmicroscopic examination, we shall be able to see their structure.\r\nExamining these first with a low power of the microscope, each one is\r\nseen to be a rounded body, from which radiate numerous filaments, the\r\n_appendages_. Each one of these appendages is coiled at the end into\r\nthe form of a little hook. Because of these hooked appendages this\r\ngenus is called _uncinula_. This rounded body is the _perithecium_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 225. Leaves of willow showing willow mildew. The\r\nblack dots are the fruit bodies (perithecia) seated on the white\r\nmycelium.]\r\n\r\n=414. Asci and ascospores.=—While we are looking at a few of\r\nthese through the microscope with the low power, we should press on the\r\ncover glass with a needle until we see a few of the perithecia rupture.\r\nIf this is done carefully we see several small ovate sacs issue, each\r\ncontaining a number of spores, as shown in fig. 227. Such a sac is an\r\n_ascus_, and the spores are _ascospores_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 226. Willow mildew; bit of mycelium with erect\r\nconidiophores, bearing chain of gonidia; gonidium at left germinating.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 227. Fruit of willow mildew, showing hooked\r\nappendages. Genus uncinula.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 228. Fruit body of another mildew with dichotomous\r\nappendages.

Contact of antheridium and carpogonium\r\n(carpogonium the larger cell); beginning of fertilization.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 230.

Fertilized egg surrounded by the enveloping\r\nthreads which grow up around it.\r\n\r\nFigs. 229-231.—Fertilization in sphærotheca; one of the powdery\r\nmildews. (After Harper.)]\r\n\r\n=415. Number of spores in an ascus.=—The ascus is the most\r\nimportant character showing the general relationship of the members of\r\nthe sac fungi. While many of the powdery mildews have a variable number\r\nof spores in an ascus, a large majority of the ascomycetes have just 8\r\nspores in an ascus, while some have 4, others 16, and some an\r\nindefinite number. The asci in a perithecium are more variable. In some\r\nascomycetes there is no perithecium.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 231_a_.\r\n\r\nEdible Morel. Morchella esculenta. The asci, forming hymenium, cover\r\nthe pitted surface.]\r\n\r\n=416. The black fungi.=—These are very common on dead logs,\r\nbranches, leaves, etc., and may be collected in the woods at almost any\r\nseason. The perithecia are often numerous, scattered or densely crowded\r\nas in Rosellinia. Sometimes they are united to form a crust which is\r\npartly formed from sterile elements as in Hypoxylon, or they form black\r\nclavate or branched bodies as in Xylaria. The black knot of the plum\r\nand cherry is also an example.\r\n\r\nThe lichens are mostly ascomycetes like the black fungi or cup fungi,\r\nwhile a few are basidiomycetes.\r\n\r\n=417. The morels (Morchella).=—There are several species of\r\nmorels which are common in early spring on damp ground. Either one of\r\nthe species is suitable for use if it is desired to include this in\r\nthe study. Fig. 231a illustrates the Morchella esculenta. The stem is\r\ncylindrical and stout. The fruiting portion forms the “head,” and it\r\nis deeply pitted. The entire pitted surface is covered by the asci,\r\nwhich are cylindrical and eight spored. A thin section may be made of\r\na portion for study, or a small piece may be crushed under the cover\r\nglass.\r\n\r\n=418. The cup fungi.=—These fungi are common on damp ground or\r\non rotting logs in the summer. They may be preserved in 70 per cent\r\nalcohol for study. Many of them are shaped like broad open cups or\r\nsaucers. The inner surface of the cup is the fruiting surface, and is\r\ncovered with the cylindrical asci, which stand side by side. A bit of\r\nthe cup may be sectioned or crushed under a cover glass for study.\r\n\r\n\r\nMushrooms (Basidiomycetes).\r\n\r\n=419. The large group of fungi= to which the mushroom belongs is\r\ncalled the basidiomycetes because in all of them a structure resembling\r\na club, or basidium, is present, and bears a limited number of spores,\r\nusually four, though in some genera the number is variable. Some place\r\nthe rusts (Uredineæ) in the same series (basidium series), because of\r\nthe short promycelium and four sporidia developed from each cell of the\r\nteleutospore.\r\n\r\n=420. The gill-bearing fungi (Agaricaceæ).=—A good example for\r\nthis study is the common mushroom (Agaricus campestris).\r\n\r\nThis occurs from July to November in lawns and grassy fields. The\r\nplant is somewhat umbrella-shaped, as shown in fig. 232, and possesses\r\na cylindrical stem attached to the under side of the convex cap or\r\npileus. On the under side of the pileus are thin radiating plates,\r\nshaped somewhat like a knife blade. These are the gills, or lamellæ,\r\nand toward the stem they are rounded on the lower angle and are not\r\nattached to the stem. The longer ones extend from near the stem to the\r\nmargin of the pileus, and the V-shaped spaces between them are occupied\r\nby successively shorter ones. Around the stem a little below the gills\r\nis a collar, termed the ring or annulus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 232. Agaricus campestris. View of under side\r\nshowing stem, annulus, gills, and margin of pileus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 233.\r\n\r\nAgaricus campestris.

Portion of hymenium of Coprinus micaceus,\r\nshowing large cystidium in the hymenium.]\r\n\r\n=421. Fruiting surface of the mushroom.=—The surface of these\r\ngills is the fruiting surface of the mushroom, and bears the gonidia\r\nof the mushroom, which are dark purplish brown when mature, and thus\r\nthe gills when old are dark in color. If we make a thin section across\r\na few of the gills, we see that each side of the gill is covered with\r\nclosely crowded club-shaped bodies, each one of which is a _basidium_.\r\nIn fig. 234 a few of these are enlarged, so that the structure of\r\nthe gill can be seen. Each basidium of the common mushroom has two\r\nspinous processes at the free end. Each one is a _sterig′ma_ (plural\r\n_sterig′mata_), and bears a gonidium. In a majority of the members of\r\nthe mushroom family each basidium bears four spores. When mature these\r\nspores easily fall away, and a mass of them gives a purplish-black\r\ncolor to objects on which they fall, so that a print of the under\r\nsurface of the cap showing the arrangement of the gills can be obtained\r\nby cutting off the stem, and placing the pileus on white paper for a\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 236. Agaricus campestris. Soil washed from “spawn”\r\nand “buttons,” showing the minute young “buttons” attached to the\r\nstrands of mycelium.]\r\n\r\n=422. How the mushroom is formed.=—The mycelium of the mushroom\r\nlives in the ground, and grows here for several months or even years,\r\nand at the proper seasons develops the mature mushroom plant. The\r\nmycelium lives on decaying organic matter, and a large number of the\r\nthreads grow closely together forming strands, or cords, of mycelium,\r\nwhich are quite prominent if they are uncovered by removing the soil,\r\nas shown in fig. 236.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 237. Agaricus campestris; sections of “buttons” of\r\ndifferent sizes, showing formation of gills and veil covering them.]\r\n\r\n=423.= From these strands the buttons arise by numerous threads\r\ngrowing side by side in a vertical direction, each thread growing\r\nindependently at the end, but all lying very closely side by side. When\r\nthe buttons are quite small the gills begin to form on the under margin\r\nof the knob. They are formed by certain of the threads growing downward\r\nin radiating ridges, just as many of these ridges being started as\r\nthere are to be gills formed. At the same time, threads of the stem\r\ngrow upward to meet those at the margin of the button in such a manner\r\nthat they cover up the forming gills, and thus enclose the gills in a\r\nminute cavity. Sections of buttons at different ages will show this, as\r\nis seen in fig. 237. This curtain of mycelium which is thus stretched\r\nacross the gill cavity is the veil. As the cap expands more and more\r\nthis is stretched into a thin and delicate texture as shown in fig.\r\n238. Finally, as shown in fig. 239, this veil is ruptured by the\r\nexpansion of the pileus, and it either clings to the stem as a collar,\r\nor a portion of it remains clinging to the margin of the cap. When the\r\nbuttons are very young the gills are white, but they soon become pink\r\nin color, and very soon after the veil breaks the spores mature, and\r\nthen the gills are dark brown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 238. Agaricus campestris; nearly mature plants,\r\nshowing veil still stretched across the gill cavity.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 239. Agaricus campestris; under view of two plants\r\njust after rupture of veil, fragments of the latter clinging both to\r\nmargin of pileus and to stem.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 240.

The mycelium spreads centrifugally each\r\nyear, consuming the available food, and thus the plants appear in a\r\nring.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 243. Amanita phalloides; white form, showing\r\npileus, stipe, annulus, and volva.]\r\n\r\n=424. Beware of the poisonous mushroom.=—The number of species\r\nof mushrooms, or toadstools as they are often called, is very great.\r\nBesides the common mushroom (Agaricus campestris) there are a large\r\nnumber of other edible species. But one should be very familiar with\r\nany species which is gathered for food, unless collected by one who\r\ncertainly knows what the plant is, since carelessness in this respect\r\nsometimes results fatally from eating poisonous ones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 244. Amanita phalloides; plant turned to one side,\r\nafter having been placed in a horizontal position, by the directive\r\nforce of gravity.]\r\n\r\n=425.= A plant very similar in structure to the Agaricus\r\ncampestris is the Lepiota naucina, but the spores are white, and thus\r\nthe gills are white, except that in age they become a dirty pink. This\r\nplant occurs in grassy fields and lawns often along with the common\r\nmushroom. Great care should be exercised in collecting and noting the\r\ncharacters of these plants, for a very deadly poisonous species, the\r\ndeadly amanita (Amanita phalloides) is perfectly white, has white\r\nspores, a ring, and grows usually in wooded places, but also sometimes\r\noccurs in the margins of lawns. In this plant the base of the stem is\r\nseated in a cup-shaped structure, the _volva_, shown in fig. 243. One\r\nshould dig up the stem carefully so as not to tear off this volva if\r\nit is present, for with the absence of this structure the plant might\r\neasily be mistaken for the lepiota, and serious consequences would\r\nresult.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 245. Edible Boletus. Boletus edulis. Fruiting\r\nsurface honey-combed on under side of cap.]\r\n\r\n=426. Tube-bearing fungi (Polyporaceæ).=—In the tube-bearing\r\nfungi, the fruiting surface, instead of lying over the surface of\r\ngills, lines the surface of tubes or pores on the under side of the\r\ncap. The fruit-bearing portion therefore is “honey-combed.” The sulphur\r\npolyporus (Polyporus sulphureus) illustrates one form. The tube-bearing\r\nfungi are sometimes called “bracket” fungi, or “shelf” fungi, because\r\nthe pileus is attached to the tree or stump like a shelf or bracket.\r\nOne very common form in the woods is the plant so much sought by\r\n“artists,” and often called Polyporus applanatus. It is hard and woody,\r\nreddish brown, brown or grayish on the upper side, according to age,\r\nand is marked by prominent and large concentric ridges. (This form is\r\nprobably P. leucophæus.) The under side is white and honey-combed by\r\nnumerous very minute pores. This plant is perennial, that is, it lives\r\nfrom year to year. Each year a new layer is added to the under side,\r\nand several new rings usually to the margin. If a plant two or three\r\nyears old is cut in two, there will be seen several distinct tube\r\nlayers or strata, each one representing a year’s growth.\r\n\r\nIn some of these bracket fungi, each ring on the upper surface marks a\r\nyear’s growth as in the pine polyporus (P. pinicola). In the birch\r\npolyporus (P. fomentarius) the tubes are quite large. It also occurs on\r\nother trees. The beech polyporus (P. igniarius, also on other trees)\r\noften becomes very old. I have seen one specimen over eighty years old.\r\nNot all the tube-bearing fungi are bracket form. Some have a stem and\r\ncap (see fig. 245). Some are spread on the surface of logs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 246. Coral fungus. Hydnum coralloides, spines\r\nhanging down from branches.]\r\n\r\n=427. Hedgehog fungi (Hydnaceæ).=—These plants are bracket in\r\nform or have a stem and cap, or are spread on the surface of wood; but\r\nthe finest specimens resemble coral masses of fungus tissue (example,\r\nHydnum, fig. 246). In most of them there are slender processes\r\nresembling teeth, spines or awls, which depend from the under surface\r\n(fig. 247). The fruiting surface covers these spines.\r\n\r\n=428. Coral fungi or fairy clubs (Clavariaceæ).=—These plants\r\nstand upright from the wood, leaves, or soil, on which they grow\r\n(example, Clavaria). The “coral” ones are branched, while the “fairy\r\nclubs” are simple. The fruiting surface covers the entire exposed\r\nsurface of the plants (fig. 248).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 247.

Classification of the fungi.=—Those who believe that the fungi\r\nrepresent a natural group of plants arrange them in three large series\r\nrelated to each other somewhat as follows:\r\n\r\n            The Gonidium Type or Series. The number of\r\n          gonidia in the sporangium is indefinite and\r\n          variable. It may be very large or very small,\r\n          or even only one in a sporangium. To this\r\n          series belong the lower fungi; examples: mucor,\r\n          saprolegnia, peronospora, etc.\r\n\r\n            The Basidium Type or Series. The number of\r\n          gonidia on a basidium is limited and definite,\r\n          and the basidium is a characteristic structure;\r\n          examples: uredineæ (rusts), mushrooms, etc.\r\n\r\n            The Ascus Type or Series. The number of spores\r\n          in an ascus is limited and definite, and the\r\n          ascus is a characteristic structure; examples:\r\n          leaf curl of peach (exoascus), powdery mildews,\r\n          black knot of plum, black rot of grapes, etc.\r\n\r\n=430.= Others believe that the fungi do not represent a natural\r\ngroup, but that they have developed off from different groups of\r\nthe algæ by becoming parasitic. As parasites they no longer needed\r\nchlorophyll, and consequently lost it.\r\n\r\nAccording to this view the lower fungi have developed off from the\r\nlower algæ (saprolegnias, mucors, peronosporas, etc., being developed\r\noff from siphonaceous algæ like vaucheria), and the higher fungi being\r\ndeveloped off from the higher algæ (the ascomycetes perhaps from the\r\nRhodophyceæ).\r\n\r\n=431. A very general outline of classification=,[19] according to\r\nthe former of these views, might be presented here to show the general\r\nrelationships of the fungi studied, with the addition of a few more\r\nin orders not represented above. It should be borne in mind that the\r\nauthor in presenting this view of classification does not necessarily\r\ncommit himself to it. It is based on that presented in Engler &\r\nPrantl’s Pflanzenfamilien. There are three classes.\r\n\r\n[19] =Class Myxomycetes=, or =Mycetozoa=.—To this class belong the\r\n“slime molds,” low organisms consisting of masses of naked protoplasm\r\nwhich flows among decaying leaves and in decaying wood, coming to\r\nthe surface to fruit. The fruit in many cases resembles miniature\r\npuff-balls, and these plants were formerly classed with the puff-balls.\r\nThe spores germinate by forming swarm spores which unite to form a\r\nsmall plasmodium, which in turn grows to form a large plasmodium or\r\nprotoplasmic mass. It is doubtful if they are any more plant than\r\nanimal organisms. Examples: Trichia, Arcyria, Stemonitis, Physarum,\r\nCeratiomyxa, etc., on rotten wood; Plasmodiophora brassicæ is a\r\nparasite causing club foot of cabbage, radishes, etc. It lives within\r\nthe roots, causing large knots and swellings on the same.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 249.\r\n\r\nChytrids. _A_, Harpochytrium hedenii, parasitic on spirogyra threads;\r\n_a_, sickle-form plant; _b_, the sporangium part with escaping\r\nzoospores; _c_, old plant proliferating by forming new sporangium\r\nin the old empty one; _d_, zoospore; _e_, two young plants just\r\nbeginning to grow. _B_, Rhizophidium globosum parasitic on spirogyra.\r\nGlobose sporangium with delicate threads inside of the host, zoospores\r\nescaping from one. _C_, Olpidium pendulum, parasitic in spirogyra cell.\r\nElliptical sporangium with slender exit tube through which zoospores\r\nare escaping. _D_, Lagenidium rabenhorstii parasitic in spirogyra cell.\r\nTwo slender sporangia with exit tubes through which protoplasm escapes\r\nforming a rounded mass at the end of tube, this protoplasm forming\r\nbiciliate zoospores.]\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Class Phycomycetes (Alga-like Fungi).\r\n\r\n\r\n1. SUBCLASS OOMYCETES.\r\n\r\n=432.= These are the egg-spore fungi. They include the water mold\r\n(Saprolegnia), the downy mildew of the grape (Plasmopara), the potato\r\nblight (Phytophthora), the white rust of cruciferous plants (Cystopus\r\n= Albugo), the damping-off fungus (Pythium), and many parasites of\r\nthe algæ known as chytrids, as Olpidium, Rhizophidium, Lagenidium,\r\nChytridium, etc.\r\n\r\nThe two following orders are sometimes placed in a separate subclass,\r\n_Archimycetes_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 250.\r\n\r\nMonoblepharis insignis Thaxter. End of hypha bearing oogonium (_oog_)\r\nand antheridium (_ant_). Sperms escaping from antheridium and creeping\r\nup on the oogonium. (After Thaxter.)]\r\n\r\n=433. Order Chytridiales (Chytridineæ).=—These include the lowest\r\nfungi. Many of them are parasitic on algæ and lack mycelium, the\r\nswarm spore either with or without minute rhizoids, developing into\r\na globose sporangium (Rhizophidium, Chytridium, Olpidium, etc., fig.\r\n249), or the swarm spore attached to the wall of the host develops into\r\na long sword-shaped body with a sterile base, which proliferates and\r\nforms a new sporangium in the old one (Harpochytrium), or with slight\r\ndevelopment of mycelium in aquatic plants (Cladochytrium). Some are\r\nparasitic in leaves and stems of land plants. Synchytrium decipiens is\r\nvery common on the trailing legume, Amphicarpæa monoica.\r\n\r\n=434. Order Ancylistales (Ancylistineæ).=—The members of this\r\norder have a slight development of mycelium and many are parasitic in\r\nalgæ (Lagenidium, fig. 249).\r\n\r\n=435. Order Saprolegniales (Saprolegniineæ).=—These include the\r\nwater molds (Saprolegnia). See Chapter XIX.\r\n\r\n=436. Order Monoblepharidales (Monoblepharidineæ).=—These are\r\npeculiar water molds, related to the Saprolegniales, but motile sperm\r\ncells are formed (Monoblepharis, etc., fig. 250).\r\n\r\n=437. Order Peronosporales (Peronosporineæ).=—These include the\r\ndowny mildews (Peronospora, Plasmopara, Phytopthora, etc.), and the\r\nwhite rust of crucifers and other plants (Cystopus = Albugo), Chapter\r\nXIX.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. SUBCLASS ZYGOMYCETES.\r\n\r\n=438.= These are the conjugating fungi.\r\n\r\n=439. Order Mucorales (Mucorineæ).=—This includes the black mold\r\nand its many relatives (Mucor, Rhizopus, etc.). Chapter XIX.\r\n\r\n=440. Order Entomophthorales (Entomophthorineæ).=—This order\r\nincludes the “fly fungus” (Empusa) and its many relatives parasitic on\r\ninsects. In the autumn and winter dead flies are often found stuck to\r\nwindow-panes, with a white ring of the conidia around each fly.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Class Ascomycetes. (The ascus series.)\r\n\r\n\r\n1. SUBCLASS HEMIASCOMYCETES.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 251.\r\n\r\nDipodascus albidus. _A_, thread with sexual organs, ascogonium and\r\nantheridium; _B_, fertilized ascogonium developing ascus; _C_, ascus\r\nwith spores; _D_, conidia. (After Lagerheim.)]\r\n\r\n=441. Order Hemiascales (Hemiascineæ).=—Fungi with a well\r\ndeveloped, septate mycelium, but with a sporangium-like ascus, i.e.,\r\na large and indefinite number of spores in the ascus. Examples:\r\nProtomyces macrosporus in stems of Umbelliferæ, or P. polysporus in\r\nAmbrosia trifida. These two are by some placed in the Ustilagineæ.\r\nDipodascus albidus grows in the exuding sap of Bromeliaceæ in Brazil\r\nand the sap of the beech in Sweden. The ascus is developed as the\r\nresult of the fertilization of an ascogonium with an antheridium (see\r\nfig. 251).\r\n\r\n\r\n2. SUBCLASS PROTOASCOMYCETES.\r\n\r\n=442. The asci are well-defined= and usually with a limited and\r\ndefinite number of spores (usually 8, sometimes 1, 2, 4, 16, or more).\r\nMycelium often well developed and septate. Asci scattered on the\r\nmycelium, not associated in definite fields or groups.\r\n\r\n=443. Order Protoascales (Protoascineæ).=—The asci are separate\r\ncells, or are scattered irregularly in loose wefts of mycelium.\r\nNo fruit body. (The yeast, Saccharomyces, see paragraph 237; and\r\ncertain mold-like fungi, some of which are parasitic on mushrooms, as\r\nEndomyces, are examples.)\r\n\r\n\r\n3. SUBCLASS EUASCOMYCETES.\r\n\r\nAsci associated in surfaces forming a hymenium, or in groups or\r\nintermingled in the elements of a fruit body. Fruit body usually\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nThe following four or five orders comprise the Discomycetes, according\r\nto the usual classification.\r\n\r\n=444. Order Protodiscales (Protodiscineæ).=—The asci are exposed\r\nand form large and indefinite groups, but there is no definite fruit\r\nbody. Examples: leaf curl of peach, plum pocket, etc. (Exoascus).\r\n\r\n=445. Order Helvellales (Helvellineæ).=—The asci form large\r\nfields over the upper portion of the fruit body. This order includes\r\nthe morels (fig. 231_a_), helvellas, earth tongues (Geoglossum), etc.\r\n\r\n=446. Order Pezizales (Pezizineæ).=—The asci form a definite\r\nfield or fruiting surface surrounded on the sides and below by a wall\r\nof fungus tissue, forming a fruit body in the shape of a cup. These are\r\nknown as the cup fungi (Peziza, Lachnea, etc.).\r\n\r\n=447. Order Phacidiales (Phacidiineæ).=—Fungi mostly saprophytic,\r\nand fruit body similar to the cup fungi. Examples: Propolis in rotting\r\nwood, Rhytisma forming black crusts on leaves (maple for example),\r\nUrnula craterium, a large black beaker-shaped fungus on the ground.\r\n\r\n=448. Order Hysteriales (Hysteriineæ).=—Fungi with a more or less\r\nelongated fruit body with an enclosing wall opening by a long slit. In\r\nsome forms the fruit body has the appearance of a two-lipped body; in\r\nothers it is shaped like a clam shell, the asci being inside. Example,\r\nHysterographium common on dry, dead, decorticated sticks.\r\n\r\n=449. Order Tuberales (Tuberineæ).=—The more or less rounded\r\nfruit bodies are usually subterranean. The most important fungi in this\r\norder are the truffles (Tuber). The mycelium of many species assists\r\nin the formation of mycorhiza on the roots of oaks, etc., and several\r\nspecies are partly cultivated, or protected, and collected for food.\r\nThis is especially the case with Tuber brumale and its forms; more than\r\na million francs worth of truffles are sold in France and Italy yearly.\r\nDogs and pigs are employed in the collection of truffles from the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n=450. Order Plectascales (Plectascineæ).=—The fruit body of these\r\nplants is more or less globose, and contains the asci distributed\r\nirregularly through the mycelium of the interior. Some are subterranean\r\n(Elaphomyces), while others grow in decaying plants, or certain food\r\nsubstances (Eurotium, Sterigmatocystis, Penicillium). Penicillium in\r\nits conidial stage forms blue mold on fruit, bread, etc.\r\n\r\nThe following four orders comprise the Pyrenomycetes, according to the\r\nusual classification.\r\n\r\n=451. Order Perisporiales.=—The powdery mildews are good examples\r\nof this order (Uncinula, Microsphæra, etc., Chapter XXI).\r\n\r\n=452. Order Hypocreales.=[20]—The fruit bodies are colorless,\r\nor bright colored and entirely enclose the asci, sometimes opening\r\nby an apical pore. Nectria cinnabarina has clusters of minute orange\r\noval fruit bodies, and is common on dead twigs. Cordyceps with a\r\nnumber of species is parasitic on insects, and on certain subterranean\r\nAscomycetes, especially Elaphomyces (of the order _Plectascales_ =\r\n_Plectascineæ_).\r\n\r\n=453. Order Dothidiales.=[21]—Fungi with black stroma formed of\r\nmycelium in which are cavities containing the asci. The cavities are\r\nusually shaped like a perithecium, but there is no wall distinct from\r\nthe tissue of the stroma (Dothidea, Phyllachora, on grasses).\r\n\r\n=454. Order Sphæriales.=[22]—These contain the so-called black\r\nfungi, with separate or clustered, oval, fruit bodies, black in color.\r\nThe black wall encloses the asci, and usually opens by an apical pore.\r\nExamples are found in the black knot of plum and cherry, black rot of\r\ngrapes, and in Rosellinia, Hypoxylon, Xylaria, etc., on dead wood.\r\n\r\n=455. Order Laboulbeniales (Laboulbineæ).=—These are peculiar\r\nfungi attached to the legs and bodies of insects by a short stalk, and\r\nprovided with a sac-like fruit body which contains the asci. Example,\r\nLaboulbenia.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. Class Basidiomycetes. (The basidium series.)\r\n\r\n\r\n1. SUBCLASS HEMIBASIDIOMYCETES.\r\n\r\n=456. Order Ustilaginales (Ustilagineæ).=—This order includes the\r\nwell-known smuts on corn, wheat, oats, etc. (Ustilago, Tilletia, etc.).\r\n\r\n\r\n2. SUBCLASS ÆCIDIOMYCETES.\r\n\r\n=457. Order Uredinales=[23] (Uredineæ).—This order includes the\r\nparasitic fungi known as rusts. Examples: wheat rust (Chapter XX), the\r\ncedar apple, etc.\r\n\r\nThe true Basidiomycetes include the following orders:\r\n\r\n\r\n3. SUBCLASS PROTOBASIDIOMYCETES.\r\n\r\n=458. Order Auriculariales.=[24]—This order includes trembling\r\nfungi in which the basidium is long and divided transversely into\r\nusually four cells (example, Auricularia), and similar forms. Pilacre\r\npetersii on dead wood represents an angiocarpous form.\r\n\r\n=459. Order Tremellales (Tremellineæ)=, trembling or gelatinous\r\nfungi with the globose basidium divided longitudinally into four cells\r\n(Tremella).\r\n\r\n\r\n4. SUBCLASS EUBASIDIOMYCETES.\r\n\r\n=460. Order Dacryomycetales (Dacryomycetineæ).=—This order\r\nincludes certain fungi of a gelatinous or waxy consistency, usually\r\nof bright colors. They resemble the Tremellales, but the basidia are\r\nslender and fork into two long sterigmata. (Example, Dacryomyces.)\r\nGyrocephalus rufus is quite a large plant, 10-15 cm. high, growing on\r\nthe ground in woods.\r\n\r\n=461. Order Exobasidiales (Exobasidiineæ).=—The fungus causing\r\nazalea apples is an example (Exobasidium).\r\n\r\n=462. Order Hymeniales (Hymenomycetineæ).=—In this order the\r\nbasidia are usually club-shaped and undivided, and bear usually four\r\nspores on the end (sometimes two or six). There are several families.\r\n\r\n=463. Family Thelephoraceæ.=—The fruit bodies are more or less\r\nmembranous and spread over wood or the ground, or somewhat leaf-like,\r\ngrowing on wood or the ground. The fruiting surface is nearly or quite\r\neven, and occupies the under side of the leaf-like bodies (Stereum,\r\nThelephora) or the outside of the forms spread out on wood (Corticium,\r\nConiophora).\r\n\r\n=464. Family Clavariaceæ.=—This order includes the fairy clubs,\r\nand some of the coral fungi. The larger number of species are in one\r\ngenus (Clavaria, fig. 248).\r\n\r\n=465. Family Hydnaceæ.=—The fungi of this order are known as\r\n“hedgehog” fungi, because of the numerous awl-like teeth or spines over\r\nwhich the fruiting surface is spread, as in Hydnum (figs. 246, 247).\r\n\r\n=466. Family Polyporaceæ.=—The tube-bearing fungi (Polyporus,\r\nBoletus, etc., fig. 245).\r\n\r\n=467. Family Agaricaceæ.=—The gill-bearing fungi (Agaricus,\r\nAmanita, etc., see Chapter XXI).\r\n\r\nThe above five orders, according to the earlier classification (still\r\nused at the present time by some), made up the order Hymenomycetes,\r\nwhile the following five orders made up the Gasteromycetes. The\r\nHymenomycetes, according to this system, included those plants in which\r\nthe fruiting portion (hymenium) is either exposed from the first, or\r\nif covered by a veil or volva (as in Agaricus, Amanita, etc.) this\r\nruptures and exposes the fruiting surface before, or at the time of,\r\nthe ripening of the spores, while the Gasteromycetes included those in\r\nwhich the fruit body is closed until after the maturity of the spores.\r\n\r\n=468. Order Phallales (Phallineæ).=—The “stink-horn” fungi, or\r\n“buzzard’s nose.” Usually foul-smelling fungi, the fruiting portion\r\nborne aloft on a stout stalk, and dissolving (Dictyophora, Ithyphallus,\r\netc.).\r\n\r\n=469. Order Hymenogastrales (Hymenogastrineæ).=—The basidia form\r\na distinct hymenium which does not break down at maturity. Some of\r\nthe plants resemble Boletus or Agaricus in the way the fruit bodies\r\nopen (Secotium, etc.), while others open irregularly on the surface\r\n(Rhizopogon) or like an earth star (Sclerogaster), or portions of the\r\nsurface become gelatinized (Phallogaster). The last-named one grows on\r\nvery rotten wood, while most of the others grow on the ground.\r\n\r\n=470. Order Lycoperdales (Lycoperdineæ).=—These include the\r\n“puff-balls,” or “devil’s snuff-box” (Lycoperdon), and the earth stars\r\n(Geaster). The basidia form a distinct hymenium, but at maturity the\r\nentire inner portion of the plant (except certain peculiar threads, the\r\ncapillitium) disintegrates and with the spores forms a powdery mass.\r\n\r\n=471. Order Nidulariales (Nidulariineæ).=—These are known\r\nas bird-nest fungi. The fruit body when mature is cup-shaped,\r\nor goblet-shaped, and contains minute flattened circular bodies\r\n(peridiola) containing the spores. The intermediate portions of the\r\nfruit body disintegrate and set the peridiola free, which then lie in\r\nthe cup-shaped base like eggs in a nest.\r\n\r\n=472. Order Plectobasidiales (Plectobasidiineæ).=—The basidia\r\ndo not form a definite hymenium, but are interwoven with the threads\r\ninside, or are collected into knot-like groups. (Examples: Calostoma,\r\nTulostoma, Astræus, Sphærobolus, etc.)\r\n\r\n=472a. Lichens.=—The plant body of the lichens (see paragraphs\r\n200, 201) consists of two component parts, the one a fungus, the other\r\nan alga. The fructification is that of the fungus. The fruit body\r\nshows the lichens to be related some to the Ascomycetes, others to\r\nthe Hymenomycetes, and Gasteromycetes. They are usually classified as\r\na distinct class or order from the fungi, but a natural arrangement\r\nwould distribute them in several of the orders above. Their special\r\nrelationship with these orders has not been satisfactorily worked out.\r\nFor the present they are arranged as follows:\r\n\r\n=Ascolichenes.=\r\n\r\n_Pyrenocarpous lichens_ (those with a fruit body like the\r\nPyrenomycetes).\r\n\r\n_Gymnocarpous lichens_ (those with a fruit body like the Discomycetes).\r\n\r\n=Hymenolichenes= (those with a fruit body like the Hymenomycetes).\r\n\r\n=Gasterolichenes= (those with a fruit body like the\r\nGasteromycetes).\r\n\r\nFrom a vegetative standpoint there are two types according to the\r\ndistribution of the elements.\r\n\r\n1st. Where the fungal and algal elements are evenly distributed in the\r\nplant body the lichen is said to be _homoiomerous_. There are two types\r\nof these:\r\n\r\n_a. Filamentous lichens_, example, Ephebe pubescens.\r\n\r\n_b. Gelatinous lichens_, example, Collema (with the alga nostoc),\r\nPhysma (with the Chroococcaceæ).\r\n\r\n2d. Where the elements are stratified, as in Parmelia, etc., the lichen\r\nis said to be _heteromerous_. In these there are three types:\r\n\r\n_a. Crustaceous lichens_, the plant body is in the form of a thin\r\nincrustation on rocks, etc.\r\n\r\n_b. Foliaceous lichens_, the plant body is leaf-like and lobed and more\r\nor less loosely attached by rhizoids: Parmelia, Peltigera, etc.\r\n\r\n_c. Fruticose lichens_, the plant body is filamentous or band-like and\r\nbranched, as in Usnea, Cladonia, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 251_a_. Rock lichen (Parmelia contigua).]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[20] As suborder in Engler and Prantl.\r\n\r\n[21] As suborder in Engler and Prantl.\r\n\r\n[22] As suborder in Engler and Prantl.\r\n\r\n[23] The Uredinales and Auriculariales in Engler and Prantl are placed\r\nin order, Auriculariineæ.\r\n\r\n[24] The Uredinales and Auriculariales in Engler and Prantl are placed\r\nin order, Auriculariineæ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nLIVERWORTS (HEPATICÆ).\r\n\r\n\r\n=473.= We come now to the study of representatives of another\r\ngroup of plants, a few of which we examined in studying the organs of\r\nassimilation and nutrition. I refer to what are called the liverworts.\r\nTwo of these liverworts belonging to the genus riccia are illustrated\r\nin figs. 30, 252.\r\n\r\n\r\nRiccia.\r\n\r\n=474. Form of the floating riccia (R. fluitans).=—The general\r\nform of floating riccia is that of a narrow, irregular, flattened,\r\nribbon-like object, which forks repeatedly, in a dichotomous manner,\r\nso that there are several lobes to a single plant. It receives its\r\nname from the fact that at certain seasons of the year it may be found\r\nfloating on the water of pools or lakes. When the water lowers it comes\r\nto rest on the damp soil, and rhizoids are developed from the under\r\nside. Now the sexual organs, and later the fruit capsule, are developed.\r\n\r\n=475. Form of the circular riccia (R. crystallina).=—The circular\r\nriccia is shown in fig. 252. The form of this one is quite different\r\nfrom the floating one, but the manner of growth is much the same.\r\nThe branching is more compact and even, so that a circular plant is\r\nthe result. This riccia inhabits muddy banks, lying flat on the wet\r\nsurface, and deriving its soluble food by means of the little rootlets\r\n(rhizoids) which grow out from the under surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 252. Thallus of Riccia crystallina.]\r\n\r\nHere and there on the margin are narrow slits, which extend nearly to\r\nthe central point. They are not real slits, however, for they were\r\nformed there as the plant grew. Each one of these V-shaped portions of\r\nthe thallus is a lobe, and they were formed in the young condition of\r\nthe plant by a branching in a forked manner. Since growth took place\r\nin all directions radially the plant became circular in form. These\r\nlarge lobes we can see are forked once or twice again, as shown by the\r\nseeming shorter slits in the margin.\r\n\r\n=476. Sexual organs.=—In order to study the sexual organs we\r\nmust make thin sections through one of these lobes lengthwise and\r\nperpendicular to the thallus surface. These sections are mounted for\r\nexamination with the microscope.\r\n\r\n=477. Archegonia.=—We are apt to find the organs in various\r\nstages of development, but we will select one of the flask-shaped\r\nstructures shown in fig. 253 for study. This flask-shaped body we see\r\nis entirely sunk in the tissue of the thallus. This structure is the\r\nfemale organ, and is what we term in these plants the _archegonium_. It\r\nis more complicated in structure than the oogonium. The lower portion\r\nis enlarged and bellied out, and is the venter of the archegonium,\r\nwhile the narrow portion is the neck. We here see it in section. The\r\nwall is one cell layer in thickness. In the neck is a canal, and in\r\nthe base of the venter we see a large rounded cell with a distinct and\r\nlarge nucleus. This cell is the _egg_ cell.\r\n\r\n=478. Antheridia.=—The antheridia are also borne in cavities sunk\r\nin the tissue of the thallus. There is here no illustration of the\r\nantheridium of this riccia, but fig. 259 represents an antheridium of\r\nanother liverwort, and there is not a great difference between the two\r\nkinds. Each one of those little rectangular sperm mother cells in the\r\nantheridium changes into a swiftly moving body like a little club with\r\ntwo long lashes attached to the smaller end. By the violent lashing of\r\nthese organs the spermatozoid is moved through the water, or moisture\r\nwhich is on the surface of the thallus. It moves through the canal of\r\nthe archegonium neck and into the egg, where it fuses with the nucleus\r\nof the egg, and thus fertilization is effected.\r\n\r\n=479. Embryo.=—In the plants which we have selected thus far for\r\nstudy, the egg, immediately after fecundation, we recollect, passed\r\ninto a resting state, and was enclosed by a thick protecting wall.\r\nBut in riccia, and in the other plants of the group which we are now\r\nstudying, this is not the case. The egg, on the other hand, after\r\nacquiring a thin wall, swells up and fills the cavity of the venter.\r\nThen it divides by a cross wall into two cells. These two grow, and\r\ndivide again, and so on until there is formed a quite large mass\r\nof cells rounded in form and still contained in the venter of the\r\narchegonium, which itself increases in size by the growth of the cells\r\nof the wall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 253.\r\n\r\nArchegonium of riccia, showing neck, venter, and the egg; archegonium\r\nis partly surrounded by the tissue of the thallus. (Riccia\r\ncrystallina.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 254.\r\n\r\nYoung embryo (sporogonium) of riccia, within the venter of the\r\narchegonium; the latter has now two layers of cells. (Riccia\r\ncrystallina.)]\r\n\r\n=480. Sporogonium of riccia.=—The fruit of riccia, which is\r\ndeveloped from the fertilized egg in the archegonium, forms a rounded\r\ncapsule still enclosed in the venter of the archegonium, which grows\r\nalso to provide space for it. Therefore a section through the plant at\r\nthis time, as described for the study of the archegonium, should show\r\nthis capsule. The capsule then is a rounded mass of cells developed\r\nfrom the egg. A single outer layer of cells forms the wall, and\r\ntherefore is sterile. All the inner cells, which are richer in\r\nprotoplasm, divide into four cells each. Each of these cells becomes\r\na spore with a thick wall, and is shaped like a triangular pyramid\r\nwhose sides are of the same extent as the base (tetrahedral). These\r\ncells formed in fours are the _spores_. At this time the wall of the\r\nspore-case dissolves, the spores separate from each other and fill the\r\nnow enlarged venter of the archegonium. When the thallus dies they are\r\nliberated, or escape between the loosely arranged cells of the upper\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 255. Nearly mature sporogonium of Riccia\r\ncrystallina; mature spore at the right.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 256.\r\n\r\nRiccia glauca; archegonium containing nearly mature sporogonium. _sg_,\r\nspore-producing cells surrounded by single layer of sterile cells, the\r\nwall of the sporogonium.]\r\n\r\n=481. A new phase in plant life.=—Thus we have here in the\r\nsporogonium of _riccia_ a very interesting phase of plant life, in\r\nwhich the egg, after fertilization, instead of developing directly into\r\nthe same phase of the plant on which it was formed, grows into a quite\r\nnew phase, the sole function of which is the development of spores.\r\nSince the form of the plant on which the sexual organs are developed\r\nis called the _gametophyte_, this new phase in which the spores are\r\ndeveloped is termed the _sporophyte_.\r\n\r\nNow the spores, when they germinate, develop the _gametophyte_, or\r\nthallus, again. So we have this very interesting condition of things,\r\nthe thallus (gametophyte) bears the sexual organs and the unfertilized\r\negg. The fertilized egg, starting as it does from a single-celled\r\nstage, develops the sporogonium (sporophyte). Here the single-cell\r\nstage is again reached in the spore, which now develops the thallus.\r\n\r\n=482. Riccia compared with coleochæte, œdogonium, etc.=—We have\r\nsaid that in the sporogonium of riccia we have formed a new phase in\r\nplant life. If we recur to our study of coleochæte we may see that\r\nthere is here possibly a state of things which presages, as we say,\r\nthis new phase which is so well formed in riccia. We recollect that\r\nafter the fertilized egg passed the period of rest it formed a small\r\nrounded mass of cells, each of which now forms a zoospore. The zoospore\r\nin turn develops the normal thallus (gametophyte) of the coleochæte\r\nagain. In coleochæte then we have two phases of the plant, each having\r\nits origin in a one-celled stage. Then if we go back to œdogonium,\r\nwe remember that the fertilized egg, before it developed into the\r\nœdogonium plant again (which is the gametophyte), at first divides into\r\n_four_ cells which become zoospores. These then develop the œdogonium\r\nplant.\r\n\r\n      Note. Too much importance should not be attached to\r\n    this seeming homology of the sporophyte of œdogonium,\r\n    coleochæte, and riccia, for the nuclear phenomena\r\n    in the formation of the zoospores of œdogonium and\r\n    coleochæte are not known. They form, however, a very\r\n    suggestive series.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarchantia.\r\n\r\n=483.= The marchantia (M. polymorpha) has been chosen for study\r\nbecause it is such a common and easily obtained plant, and also for\r\nthe reason that with comparative ease all stages of development can\r\nbe obtained. It illustrates also very well certain features of the\r\nstructure of the liverworts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 257. Male plant of marchantia bearing\r\nantheridiophores.]\r\n\r\nThe plants are of two kinds, male and female. The two different organs,\r\nthen, are developed on different plants. In appearance, however, before\r\nthe beginning of the structures which bear the sexual organs they\r\nare practically the same. The thallus is flattened like nearly all\r\nof the thalloid forms, and branches in a forked manner. The color is\r\ndark green, and through the middle line of the thallus the texture is\r\ndifferent from that of the margins, so that it possesses what we term a\r\nmidrib, as shown in figs. 257, 261. The growing point of the thallus is\r\nsituated in the little depression at the free end. If we examine the\r\nupper surface with a hand lens we see diamond-shaped areas, and at the\r\ncenter of each of these areas are the openings known as the stomates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 258. Section of antheridial receptacle from male\r\nplant of Marchantia polymorpha, showing cavities where the antheridia\r\nare borne.]\r\n\r\n=484. Antheridial plants.=—One of the male plants is figured at\r\n257. It bears curious structures, each held aloft by a short stalk.\r\nThese are the antheridial receptacles (or male gametophores). Each\r\none is circular, thick, and shaped somewhat like a biconvex lens. The\r\nupper surface is marked by radiating furrows, and the margin is\r\ncrenate. Then we note, on careful examination of the upper surface,\r\nthat there are numerous minute openings. If we make a thin section of\r\nthis structure perpendicular to its surface we shall be able to unravel\r\nthe mystery of its interior. Here we see, as shown in fig. 258, that\r\neach one of these little openings on the surface is an entrance to quite\r\na large cavity. Within each cavity there is an oval or elliptical\r\nbody, supported from the base of the cavity on a short stalk. This is\r\nan antheridium, and one of them is shown still more enlarged in fig.\r\n259. This shows the structure of the antheridium, and that there are\r\nwithin several angular areas, which are divided by numerous straight\r\ncross-lines into countless tiny cuboidal cells, the _sperm mother\r\ncells_. Each of these, as stated in the former chapter, changes into a\r\nswiftly moving body resembling a serpent with two long lashes attached\r\nto its tail.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 259. Section of antheridium of marchantia, showing\r\nthe groups of sperm mother cells.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 260. Spermatozoids of marchantia, uncoiling and one\r\nextended, showing the two cilia.]\r\n\r\n=485.= The way in which one of these sperm mother cells changes\r\ninto this spermatozoid is very curious. We first note that a coiled\r\nspiral body is appearing within the thin wall of the cell, one end of\r\nthe coil larger than the other. The other end terminates in a slender\r\nhair-like outgrowth with a delicate vesicle attached to its free end.\r\nThis vesicle becomes more and more extended until it finally breaks and\r\nforms two long lashes which are clubbed at their free ends as shown in\r\nfig. 260.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 261. Marchantia polymorpha, female plants bearing\r\narchegoniophores.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 262. Marchantia polymorpha, showing origin of\r\ngametophore.]\r\n\r\n=486. Archegonial plants.=—In fig. 261 we see one of the female\r\nplants of marchantia. Upon this there are also very curious structures,\r\nwhich remind one of miniature umbrellas. The general plan of the\r\narchegonial receptacle (or female gametophore), for this is what these\r\nstructures are, is similar to that of the antheridial receptacle,\r\nbut the rays are more pronounced, and the details of structure are\r\nquite different, as we shall see. Underneath the arms there hang down\r\ndelicate fringed curtains. If we make sections of this in the same\r\ndirection as we did of the antheridial receptacle, we shall be able to\r\nfind what is secreted behind these curtains. Such a section is figured\r\nat 266. Here we find the archegonia, but instead of being sunk in\r\ncavities their bases are attached to the under surface, while the\r\ndelicate, pendulous fringes afford them protection from drying. An\r\narchegonium we see is not essentially different in marchantia from\r\nwhat it is in riccia, and it will be interesting to learn whether the\r\nsporogonium is essentially different from what we find in riccia.\r\n\r\n=487. Homology of the gametophore of marchantia.=—To see the\r\nrelation of the gametophore to the thallus of marchantia take portions\r\nof the thallus bearing the female receptacle. On the under side note\r\nthat the prominent midrib continues beyond the thin lateral expansions\r\nand arches upward in the sinus or notch at the end, or at the side\r\nwhere the branch of the thallus has continued to grow beyond. The stalk\r\nof the gametophore is then a continuation of the midrib of the thallus.\r\nOn the apex of this are organized several radial growing points which\r\ndevelop the digitate or ray-like receptacle. The gametophore is thus a\r\nspecialized branch of the thallus. When young, or in many cases when\r\nnearly or quite mature, the gametophore, as one looks at the upper\r\nsurface of the thallus, appears to arise from the upper surface, as in\r\nfig. 261. This is because the thin lateral expansions of the thallus\r\nproject forward and overlap in advance of the stalk. It is sometimes\r\nnecessary to tear these overlapping edges apart to see the real origin\r\nof the gametophore. But in quite old plants these expanded portions are\r\nfarther apart and show clearly that the stalk arises from the midrib\r\nbelow and arches upward in the sinus, as in fig. 262.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nLIVERWORTS CONTINUED.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 263.\r\n\r\nArchegonial receptacles of marchantia bearing ripe sporogonia. The\r\ncapsule of the sporogonium projects outside, while the stalk is\r\nattached to the receptacle underneath the curtain. In the left figure\r\ntwo of the capsules have burst and the elaters and spores are escaping.]\r\n\r\n=488. Sporogonium of marchantia.=—If we examine the plant shown\r\nin fig. 181 we shall see oval bodies which stand out between the\r\nrays of the female receptacle, supported on short stalks. These are\r\nthe sporogonia, or spore-cases. We judge at once that they are quite\r\ndifferent from those which we have studied in riccia, since those were\r\nnot stalked. We can see that some of the spore-cases have opened, the\r\nwall splitting down from the apex in several lines. This is caused by\r\nthe drying of the wall. These tooth-like divisions of the wall now\r\ncurl backward, and we can see the yellowish mass of the spores in slow\r\nmotion, falling here and there. It appears also as if there were\r\ntwisting threads which aided the spores in becoming freed from the\r\ncapsule.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 264.\r\n\r\nSection of archegonial receptacle of Marchantia polymorpha; ripe\r\nsporogonia. One is open, scattering spores and elaters; two are still\r\nenclosed in the wall of the archegonium. The junction of the stalk of\r\nthe sporogonium with the receptacle is the point of attachment of the\r\nsporophyte of marchantia with the gametophyte.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 265. Elater and spore of marchantia. _sp_, spore;\r\n_mc_, mother cell of spores, showing partly formed spores.]\r\n\r\n=489. Spores and elaters.=—If we take a bit of this mass of\r\nspores and mount it in water for examination with the microscope, we\r\nshall see that, besides the spores, there are very peculiar thread-like\r\nbodies, the markings of which remind one of a twisted rope. These are\r\nvery long cells from the inner part of the spore-case, and their walls\r\nare marked by spiral thickenings. This causes them in drying, and also\r\nwhen they absorb moisture, to twist and curl in all sorts of ways. They\r\nthus aid in pushing the spores out of the capsule as it is drying.\r\n\r\n=490. Sporophyte of marchantia compared with riccia.=—We must\r\nrecollect that the sporogonium in marchantia is larger than in riccia,\r\nand that it is also not lying in the tissue of the thallus, but is only\r\nattached to it at one side by a slender stalk. This shows us an\r\nincrease in the size and complex structure of this new phase of the\r\nplant, the _sporophyte_. This is one of the very interesting things\r\nwhich we have to note as we go on in the study of the higher plants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 266.\r\n\r\nMarchantia polymorpha, archegonium at the left with egg; archegonium at\r\nthe right with young sporogonium; _p_, curtain which hangs down around\r\nthe archegonia; _e_, egg; _v_, venter of archegonium; _n_, neck of\r\narchegonium; _sp_, young sporogonium.]\r\n\r\n=491. Sporophyte dependent on the gametophyte for its\r\nnutriment.=—We thus see that at no time during the development of\r\nthe sporogonium is it independent from the gametophyte. This new phase\r\nof plants then, the sporophyte, has not yet become an independent\r\nplant, but must rely on the earlier phase for sustenance.\r\n\r\n=492. Development of the sporogonium.=—It will be interesting\r\nto note briefly how the development of the marchantia sporogonium\r\ndiffers from that of riccia. The first division of the fertilized egg\r\nis the same as in riccia, that is a wall which runs crosswise of the\r\naxis of the archegonium divides it into two cells. In marchantia the\r\ncell at the base develops the stalk, so that here there is a radical\r\ndifference. The outer cell forms the capsule. But here after the wall\r\nis formed the inner tissue does not all go to make spores, as is the\r\ncase with riccia. But some of it forms the elaters. While in riccia\r\nonly the outside layer of cells of the sporogonium remained sterile, in\r\nmarchantia the basal half of the egg remains completely sterile and\r\ndevelops the stalk, and in the outer half the part which is formed from\r\nsome of the inner tissue is also sterile.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 267.\r\n\r\nSection of developing sporogonia of marchantia; _nt_, nutritive tissue\r\nof gametophyte; _st_, sterile tissue of sporophyte; _sp_, fertile part\r\nof sporophyte; _va_, enlarged venter of archegonium.]\r\n\r\n=493. Embryo.=—In the development of the embryo we can see all\r\nthe way through this division line between the basal half, which is\r\ncompletely sterile, and the outer half, which is the fertile part. In\r\nfig. 267 we see a young embryo, and it is nearly circular in section\r\nalthough it is composed of numerous cells. The basal half is attached\r\nto the base of the inner surface of the archegonium, and at this time\r\nthe archegonium still surrounds it. The archegonium continues to grow\r\nthen as the embryo grows, and we can see the remains of the shrivelled\r\nneck. The portion of the embryo attached to the base of the archegonium\r\nis the sterile part and is called the “foot,” and later develops the\r\nstalk. The sporogonium during all the stages of its development derives\r\nits nourishment from the gametophyte at this point of attachment at\r\nthe base of the archegonium. Soon, as shown in fig. 267 at the right,\r\nthe outer portion of the sporogonium begins to differentiate into\r\nthe cells which form the elaters and those which form spores. These\r\nlie in radiating lines side by side, and form what is termed the\r\n_archesporium_. Each fertile cell forms four spores just as in riccia.\r\nThey are thus called the mother cells of the spores, or spore mother\r\ncells.\r\n\r\n=494. How marchantia multiplies.=—New plants of marchantia are\r\nformed by the germination of the spores, and growth of the same to the\r\nthallus. The plants may also be multiplied by parts of the old ones\r\nbreaking away by the action of strong currents of water, and when they\r\nlodge in suitable places grow into well-formed plants. As the thallus\r\nlives from year to year and continues to grow and branch the older\r\nportions die off, and thus separate plants may be formed from a former\r\nsingle one.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 268. Marchantia plant with cupules and gemmæ;\r\nrhizoids below.]\r\n\r\n=495. Buds, or gemmæ, of marchantia.=—But there is another\r\nway in which marchantia multiplies itself. If we examine the upper\r\nsurface of such a plant as that shown in fig. 268, we shall see that\r\nthere are minute cup-shaped or saucer-shaped vessels, and within them\r\nminute green bodies. If we examine a few of these minute bodies with\r\nthe microscope we see that they are flattened, biconvex, and at two\r\nopposite points on the margin there is an indentation similar to that\r\nwhich appears at the growing end of the old marchantia thallus. These\r\nare the growing points of these little buds. When they free themselves\r\nfrom the cups they come to lie on one side. It does not matter on what\r\nside they lie, for whichever side it is, that will develop into the\r\nlower side of the thallus, and forms rhizoids, while the upper surface\r\nwill develop the stomates.\r\n\r\n\r\nLeafy-stemmed liverworts.\r\n\r\n=496.= We should now examine more carefully than we have done\r\nformerly a few of the leafy-stemmed liverworts (called foliose\r\nliverworts).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 269.\r\n\r\nSection of thallus of marchantia. _A_, through the middle portion; _B_,\r\nthrough the marginal portion; _p_, colorless layer; _chl_, chlorophyll\r\nlayer; _sp_, stomate; _h_, rhizoids; _b_, leaf-like outgrowths on\r\nunderside (Goebel).]\r\n\r\n=497. Frullania= (Fig. 32).—This plant grows on the bark of\r\nlogs, as well as on the bark of standing trees. It lives in quite dry\r\nsituations. If we examine the leaves we will see how it is able to do\r\nthis. We note that there are two rows of lateral leaves, which are very\r\nclose together, so close in fact that they overlap like the shingles\r\non a roof. Then, as the creeping stems lie very close to the bark of\r\nthe tree, these overlapping leaves, which also hug close to the stem\r\nand bark, serve to retain moisture which trickles down the bark during\r\nrains. If we examine these leaves from the under side as shown in fig.\r\n34, we see that the lower or basal part of each one is produced into a\r\npeculiar lobe which is more or less cup-shaped. This catches water and\r\nholds it during dry weather, and it also holds moisture which the plant\r\nabsorbs during the night and in damp days. There is so much moisture in\r\nthese little pockets of the under side of the leaf that minute animals\r\nhave found them good places to live in, and one frequently discovers\r\nthem in this retreat. There is here also a third row of poorly\r\ndeveloped leaves on the under side of the stem.\r\n\r\n=498. Porella.=—Growing in similar situations is the plant known\r\nas porella. Sometimes there are a few plants in a group, and at other\r\ntimes large mats occur on the bark of a trunk. This plant, porella,\r\nalso has closely overlapping leaves in rows on opposite sides of the\r\nstem, and the lower margin of each leaf is curved under somewhat as in\r\nfrullania, though the pocket is not so well formed.\r\n\r\nThe larger plants are female, that is they bear archegonia, while\r\nthe male plants, those which bear antheridia, are smaller and the\r\nantheridia are borne on small lateral branches. The antheridia\r\nare borne in the axils of the leaves. Others of the leafy-stemmed\r\nliverworts live in damp situations. Some of these, as Cephalozia, grow\r\non damp rotten logs. Cephalozia is much more delicate, and the leaves\r\nare farther apart. It could not live in such dry situations where the\r\nfrullania is sometimes found. If possible the two plants should be\r\ncompared in order to see the adaptation in the structure and form to\r\ntheir environment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 270. Thallus of a thalloid liverwort (blasia)\r\nshowing lobed margin of the frond, intermediate between thalloid and\r\nfoliose plant.]\r\n\r\n=499. Sporogonium of a foliose liverwort.=—The sporogonium of the\r\nleafy-stemmed liverworts is well represented by that of several genera.\r\nWe may take for this study the one illustrated in fig. 274, but\r\nanother will serve the purpose just as well. We note here that it\r\nconsists of a rounded capsule borne aloft on a long stalk, the stalk\r\nbeing much longer proportionately than in marchantia. At maturity the\r\ncapsule splits down into four quadrants, the wall forming four valves,\r\nwhich spread apart from the unequal drying of the cells, so that the\r\nspores are set free, as shown in fig. 276. Some of the cells inside\r\nof the capsule develop elaters here also as well as spores. These are\r\nillustrated in fig. 278.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 271. Foliose liverwort, male plant showing\r\nantheridia in axils of the leaves (a jungermannia).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 272. Antheridium of a foliose liverwort\r\n(jungermannia).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 273. Foliose liverwort, female plant with rhizoids.]\r\n\r\n=500.= In this plant we see that the sporophyte remains attached to\r\nthe gametophyte, and thus is dependent on it for sustenance. This is\r\ntrue of all the plants of this group. The sporophyte never becomes\r\ncapable of an independent existence, and yet we see that it is becoming\r\nlarger and more highly differentiated than in the simple riccia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 274. Fruiting plant of a foliose liverwort\r\n(jungermannia). Leafy part is the gametophyte; stalk and capsule is the\r\nsporophyte (sporogonium in the bryophytes).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 275.

The horned liverworts= take their name from the shape of\r\nthe sporogonium. This is long, slender, cylindrical, pointed, and very\r\nslightly curved, suggesting the shape of a minute horn. Anthoceros is\r\none of the most common and widely distributed species. The plant grows\r\non damp soil or on mud.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnthoceros.\r\n\r\n=502. The gametophyte.=—The gametophyte is thalloid. It is thin,\r\nflattened, green, irregularly ribbon-shaped and branched. It lies on\r\nthe soil and is more or less crisped or wavy, or curled, the edges\r\nnearly plane, or somewhat irregular, and with minute lobes, or notches,\r\nespecially near the growing end. The general form and branching can\r\nbe seen in fig. 279. Where the plants are much crowded the thallus is\r\nmore irregular, and often possesses numerous small lateral branches\r\nin addition to the main lobes. Upon the under side are the slender\r\nrhizoids, which attach to the soil. With a hand lens there can be seen\r\nalso upon the under side small dark, rounded and thickened spots, where\r\nan alga (nostoc) is located.\r\n\r\n\r\nSexual Organs of Anthoceros.\r\n\r\n=502. The sexual organs of anthoceros= differ considerably from\r\nthose of the other liverworts studied. In the first place they are\r\nimmersed in the true tissue of the thallus, i.e., they do not project\r\nabove the surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 279.\r\n\r\nAnthoceros gracilis. _A_, several gametophytes, on which sporangia\r\nhave developed; _B_, an enlarged sporogonium, showing its elongated\r\ncharacter and dehiscence by two valves, leaving exposed the slender\r\ncolumella on the surface of which are the spores, _C_, _D_, _E_, _F_,\r\nelaters of various forms, _G_, spores. (After Schiffner.)]\r\n\r\n=503. Antheridia.=—The antheridium arises from an internal cell\r\nof the thallus, a cell just below the upper surface. This cell develops\r\nusually a group of antheridia which lie in a cavity formed around this\r\ncell as the thallus continues to grow. They are situated along the\r\nmiddle line of the thallus, and can be seen by making a section in this\r\ndirection. The antheridia are oval or rounded, have a wall of one layer\r\nof cells which contains the sperm cells, and each antheridium has a\r\nslender stalk. The sperms are like those of the true liverworts.\r\n\r\n=504. Archegonia.=—The archegonia are also borne along the\r\nmiddle line of the thallus. Each one arises at an early stage in the\r\ndevelopment of the tissue of the thallus from a superficial cell,\r\nbut the archegonium does not project above the surface. The venter\r\ntherefore which contains the egg is deep down in the thallus, the wall\r\nof the neck is formed from cells indistinguishable from the adjoining\r\ncells of the thallus and opens at the surface.\r\n\r\n\r\nSporophyte of Anthoceros.\r\n\r\n=505. The Sporogonium.=—The sporogonium is developed from the\r\nfertilized egg, fertilization resulting of course from the fusion of\r\none of the sperms with the nucleus of the egg. From the lower part\r\nof the embryo certain cells elongate and push out like rhizoids into\r\nthe thallus (gametophyte), but never reach the outside so that the\r\nsporogonium derives its nutriment from the gametophyte in a parasitic\r\nmanner like the true liverworts. It is surrounded at the base by a\r\nsheath, an outgrowth of the gametophyte.\r\n\r\n=506. Growing point of the sporogonium.=—A remarkable thing\r\nabout the sporogonium of anthoceros, and its relatives, is that the\r\ngrowing point instead of being situated at the free end is located near\r\nthe base, just above the nourishing foot. Thus the upper part of the\r\nsporogonium is older. In the old sporogonia there may be ripe spores\r\nnear the free end, young ones near the middle, and undifferentiated\r\ngrowing tissue near the base. A longitudinal section of a sporogonium\r\njust as the spores are ripening will show this.\r\n\r\n=507. Structure of the sporogonium.=—A longitudinal section\r\nof the sporogonium shows that the spore-bearing tissue occupies a\r\ncomparatively small portion of the sporogonium. In the section there\r\nis a narrow layer (two cells thick) on either side and joined at the\r\ntop. In the entire sporogonium this fertile tissue is in the shape of\r\nan inverted test tube situated inside of the sporogonium. The wall of\r\nthe sporogonium is about four cells thick. The sterile tissue inside\r\nof the spore-bearing tube is the columella. The cells of the wall\r\ncontain chlorophyll, and there are true stomata with guard cells in the\r\nepidermal layer.\r\n\r\n=508. Spores and elaters.=—In the spore-bearing tissue there\r\nare two layers of cells (the archesporium). Each cell is a potential\r\nmother cell. The cells, however, of alternate tiers do not form spores.\r\nThey elongate some what and are somewhat irregular and sometimes divide\r\nor branch. They are supposed to represent rudimentary _elaters_. The\r\ncells in the other tiers are actual mother cells, and each one forms\r\nfour spores.\r\n\r\n=509. The sporophyte of anthoceros= represents the highest type\r\nfound in the liverworts. The spongy green parenchyma forming the\r\nwall, with the stomata in the epidermal layer, fits this tissue for\r\nthe process of photosynthesis, so that this part of the sporophyte\r\nfunctions as the green leaf of the seed plants. It has been suggested\r\nby some that if the rhizoids on the nourishing foot could only extend\r\noutside and anchor in the soil, the sporophyte of anthoceros could live\r\nan independent existence. But we see that it stops short of that.\r\n\r\n\r\nClassification of the Liverworts.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS HEPATICÆ.\r\n\r\n=510. Order Marchantiales.=[26]—There are two families represented\r\nin the United States.\r\n\r\nFamily Ricciaceæ, including Riccia and Ricciocarpus.\r\n\r\nFamily Marchantiaceæ, including Marchantia, Fegatella (= Conocephalus),\r\nFimbriaria, Targionia, etc.\r\n\r\n=511. Order Jungermanniales.=[27]—There are two subdivisions\r\nof this order. _The Anacrogynæ_ include chiefly thalloid forms with\r\ncontinued apical growth, the archegonia back of the apical cell.\r\nExamples: Blasia, Aneura, Pellia, etc.\r\n\r\n_The Acrogynæ_ include chiefly foliose forms, the archegonia arising\r\nfrom the apical cell and in such cases interrupting apical growth.\r\nExamples: Cephalozia, Frullania, Bazzania, Jungermannia, Ptilidium,\r\nPorella, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS ANTHOCEROTES.\r\n\r\n=512. The Anthocerotes= have formerly been placed with the\r\nHepaticæ as an order. But because of their wide divergence from\r\nthe other liverworts in the development of the sexual organs, and\r\nespecially in the structure of the sporophyte, they are now by some\r\nseparated as a distinct class. There is one order.\r\n\r\n=Order Anthocerotales.=[28]—This includes one family\r\n(Anthocerotaceæ) with Anthoceros and Notothylas in Europe and North\r\nAmerica, and Dendroceros in the tropics. The latter is epiphytic.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[25] May be used as an alternate study for marchantia.\r\n\r\n[26] As subclass in Engler and Prantl.\r\n\r\n[27] As subclass in Engler and Prantl.\r\n\r\n[28] As subclass in Engler and Prantl.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nMOSSES (MUSCI).\r\n\r\n\r\n=513.= We are now ready to take up the more careful study of the\r\nmoss plant. There are a great many kinds of mosses, and they differ\r\ngreatly from each other in the finer details of structure. Yet there\r\nare certain general resemblances which make it convenient to take for\r\nstudy almost any one of the common species in a neighborhood, which\r\nforms abundant fruit. Some, however, are more suited to a first study\r\nthan others. (Polytrichum and funaria are good mosses to study.)\r\n\r\n=514. Mnium.=—We will select here the plant shown in fig. 280.\r\nThis is known as a mnium (M. affine), and one or another of the species\r\nof mnium can be obtained without much difficulty. The mosses, as we\r\nhave already learned, possess an axis (stem) and leaf-like expansions,\r\nso that they are leafy-stemmed plants also. Certain of the branches of\r\nthe mnium stand upright, or nearly so, and the leaves are all of the\r\nsame size at any given point on the stem, as seen in the figure. There\r\nare three rows of these leaves, and this is true of most of the mosses.\r\n\r\n=515.= The mnium plants usually form quite extensive and pretty\r\nmats of green in shady moist woods or ravines. Here and there among the\r\nerect stems are prostrate ones, with two rows of prominent leaves so\r\narranged that it reminds one of some of the leafy-stemmed liverworts.\r\nIf we examine some of the leaves of the mnium we see that the greater\r\npart of the leaf consists of a single layer of green cells, just as\r\nis the case in the leafy-stemmed liverworts. But along the middle\r\nline is a thicker layer, so that it forms a distinct midrib. This is\r\ncharacteristic of the leaves of mosses, and is one way in which they\r\nare separated from the leafy-stemmed liverworts, the latter never\r\nhaving a midrib.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 280.\r\n\r\nPortion of moss plant of Mnium affine, showing two sporogonia from one\r\nbranch. Capsule at left has just shed the cap or operculum; capsule at\r\nright is shedding spores, and the teeth are bristling at the mouth.\r\nNext to the right is a young capsule with calyptra still attached; next\r\nare two spores enlarged.]\r\n\r\n=516. The fruiting moss plant.=—In fig. 280 is a moss plant “in\r\nfruit,” as we say. Above the leafy stem a slender stalk bears the\r\ncapsule, and in this capsule are borne the spores. The capsule then\r\nbelongs to the _sporophyte phase_ of the moss plant, and we should\r\ninquire whether the entire plant as we see it here is the sporophyte,\r\nor whether part of it is gametophyte. If a part of it is gametophyte\r\nand a part sporophyte, then where does the one end and the other begin?\r\nIf we strip off the leaves at the end of the leafy stem, and make a\r\nlongisection in the middle line, we should find that the stalk which\r\nbears the capsule is simply stuck into the end of the leafy stem, and\r\nis not organically connected with it. This is the dividing line, then,\r\nbetween the gametophyte and the sporophyte. We shall find that here the\r\narchegonium containing the egg is borne, which is a surer way of\r\ndetermining the limits of the two phases of the plant.\r\n\r\n=517. The male and female moss plants.=—The two plants of mnium\r\nshown in figs. 281, 282 are quite different, as one can easily see,\r\nand yet they belong to the same species. One is a female plant, while\r\nthe other is a male plant. The sexual organs then in mnium, as in many\r\nothers of the mosses, are borne on separate plants. The archegonia are\r\nborne at the end of the stem, and are protected by somewhat narrower\r\nleaves which closely overlap and are wrapped together. They are similar\r\nto the archegonia of the liverworts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 281. Female plant (gametophyte) of a moss (mnium),\r\nshowing rhizoids below, and the tuft of leaves above which protect the\r\narchegonia.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 282. Male plant (gametophyte) of a moss (mnium)\r\nshowing rhizoids below and the antheridia at the center above\r\nsurrounded by the rosette of leaves.]\r\n\r\nThe male plants of mnium are easily selected, since the leaves at the\r\nend of the stem form a broad rosette with the antheridia, and some\r\nsterile threads packed closely together in the center. The ends of the\r\nmass of antheridia can be seen with the naked eye, as shown in fig.\r\n282. When the antheridia are ripe, if we make a section through a\r\ncluster, or if we merely tease out some from the end with a needle in\r\na drop of water on the slide, then prepare for examination with the\r\nmicroscope, we can see the form of the antheridia. They are somewhat\r\nclavate or elliptical in outline, as seen in fig. 284. Between them\r\nthere stand short threads composed of several cells containing\r\nchlorophyll grains. These are sterile threads (paraphyses).\r\n\r\n=518. Sporogonium.=—In fig. 280 we see illustrated a sporogonium\r\nof mnium, which is of course developed from the fertilized egg-cell of\r\nthe archegonium. There is a nearly cylindrical capsule, bent downward,\r\nand supported on a long slender stalk. Upon the capsule is a peculiar\r\ncap,[29] shaped like a ladle or spatula. This is the remnant of the\r\nold archegonium, which, for a time surrounded and protected the young\r\nembryo of the sporogonium, just as takes place in the liverworts. In\r\nmost of the mosses this old remnant of the archegonium is borne aloft\r\non the capsule as a cap, while in the liverworts it is thrown to one\r\nside as the sporogonium elongates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 283. Section through end of stem of female plant of\r\nmnium, showing archegonia at the center. One archegonium shows the egg.\r\nOn the sides are sections of the protecting leaves.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 284. Antheridium of mnium with jointed paraphysis\r\nat the left; spermatozoids at the right.]\r\n\r\n=519. Structure of the moss capsule.=—At the free end on the moss\r\ncapsule as shown in the case of mnium in fig. 280, after the remnant\r\nof the archegonium falls away, there is seen a conical lid which fits\r\nclosely over the end. When the capsule is ripe this lid easily falls\r\naway, and can be brushed off so that it is necessary to handle the\r\nplants with care if it is desired to preserve this for study.\r\n\r\n=520.= When the lid is brushed away as the capsule dries more we\r\nsee that the end of the capsule covered by the lid appears “frazzled.”\r\nIf we examine this end with the microscope we see that the tissue of\r\nthe capsule here is torn with great regularity, so that there are two\r\nrows of narrow, sharp teeth which project outward in a ring around the\r\nopening. If we blow our “breath” upon these teeth they will be seen to\r\nmove, and as the moisture disappears and reappears in the teeth, they\r\nclose and open the mouth of the capsule, so sensitive are they to the\r\nchanges in the humidity of the air. In this way all of the spores are\r\nprevented to some extent from escaping from the capsule at one time.\r\n\r\n=521.= Note. If we make a section longitudinal of the capsule of\r\nmnium, or some other moss, we find that the tissue which develops the\r\nspores is much more restricted than in the capsule of the liverworts\r\nwhich we have studied. The spore-bearing tissue is confined to a single\r\nlayer which extends around the capsule some distance from the outside\r\nof the wall, so that a central cylinder is left of sterile tissue. This\r\nis the columella, and is present in nearly all the mosses. Each of the\r\ncells of the fertile layer divides into four spores.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 285. Two different stages of young sporogonium of\r\na moss, still within the archegonium and wedging their way into the\r\ntissue of the end of the stem. _h_, neck of archegonium; _f_, young\r\nsporogonium. This shows well the connection of the sporophyte with the\r\ngametophyte.]\r\n\r\n=522. Development of the sporogonium.=—The egg-cell after\r\nfertilization divides by a wall crosswise to the axis of the\r\narchegonium. Each of these cells continues to divide for a time, so\r\nthat a cylinder pointed at both ends is formed. The lower end of\r\nthis cylinder of tissue wedges its way down through the base of the\r\narchegonium into the tissue of the end of the moss stem as shown in\r\nfig. 285. This forms the foot through which the nutrient materials\r\nare passed from the gametophyte to the sporogonium. The upper part\r\ncontinues to grow, and finally the upper end differentiates into the\r\nmature capsule.\r\n\r\n=523. Protonema of the moss.=—When the spores of a moss germinate\r\nthey form a thread-like body, with chlorophyll. This thread becomes\r\nbranched, and sometimes quite extended tangles of these threads are\r\nformed. This is called the protonema, that is _first thread_. The older\r\nthreads become finally brown, while the later ones are green. From this\r\nprotonema at certain points buds appear which divide by close oblique\r\nwalls. From these buds the leafy stem of the moss plant grows. Threads\r\nsimilar to these protonemal threads now grow out from the leafy stem,\r\nto form the rhizoids. These supply the moss plant with nutriment, and\r\nnow the protonema usually dies, though in some few species it persists\r\nfor long periods.\r\n\r\n\r\nClassification of the Mosses.\r\n\r\nCLASS MUSCINEÆ (MUSCI).\r\n\r\n=524. Order Sphagnales.=[30]—This order includes the peat mosses. There\r\nis but one family (Sphagnaceæ) and but a single genus (Sphagnum). The\r\npeat mosses are widely distributed over the globe, chiefly occurring\r\nin moors, or “bogs,” usually low ground around the shores of lakes,\r\nponds, or along streams, but they often occur on wet dripping rocks in\r\ncool shady places. Small ponds are sometimes filled in by their growth.\r\nAs the sphagnum growing in such an abundance of water only partially\r\ndecays, “ground” is built up rather rapidly, and the sphagnum remains\r\nare known as “peat.” This “ground”-building peculiarity of sphagnum\r\nsometimes enables the plant (often in conjunction with others) to fill\r\nin ponds completely. (See Atoll Moor, Chapter LV.)\r\n\r\nThe gametophyte of sphagnum, like that of all the mosses, is dimorphic,\r\nbut the first part (or protonema) which develops from the spores is\r\nthalloid, and therefore more like the thallose liverworts. The leafy\r\naxis (or gametophore) which develops from the thalloid form is very\r\ncharacteristic (see Chapter LV).\r\n\r\nThe archegonia are borne on the free end of the main axis, while the\r\nantheridia are borne on short branches which are brightly colored, red,\r\nyellow, etc. The sporophyte (sporogonium) is globose and possesses a\r\nbroad foot anchored in the end of a naked prolongation of the end of\r\nthe leafy gametophore. This naked prolongation of the gametophore looks\r\nlike the stalk of the sporogonium, but a study of its connection with\r\nthe sporogonium shows that it is part of the gametophyte, which is only\r\ndeveloped after the fertilization of the egg in the archegonium. In the\r\nsporogonium there is a short columella, and the archesporium is in the\r\nform of an inverted cup.\r\n\r\n=525. Order Andreæales.=[31]—This order includes the single genus\r\nAndreæa. The plants are small but form extensive mats, growing on rocks\r\nin arctic or alpine regions usually. They are sometimes found in great\r\nabundance on bare, rather dry rocks on mountains. The protonema is\r\nsomewhat thalloid. The sporogonium opens by splitting longitudinally\r\ninto four valves. An elongated columella is present so that the\r\narchesporium is shaped like an inverted test tube.\r\n\r\n=526. Order Archidiales.=[32]—This order contains the single genus\r\nArchidium, and by some is placed as an aberrant genus in the Bryales.\r\nThere is no columella in the simple sporogonium. The archesporium\r\noccupies all the internal part of the sporogonium, some cells being\r\nfertile and others sterile.\r\n\r\n=527. Order Bryales.=[33]—These include the higher mosses, and a very\r\nlarge number of genera and species. The protonema is filamentous and\r\nbranched except in a few forms where it is partly thalloid as in\r\nTetraphis (= Georgia). (Tetraphis pellucida is a common moss on very\r\nrotten logs. The capsule has four prominent teeth.) In a few of the\r\nlower genera (Phascum, Pleuridium, etc.) the capsule opens irregularly,\r\nbut in the larger number the capsule opens by a lid (operculum). A\r\ncylindrical columella is present, and the archesporium is in the form\r\nof a tube open at both ends. (Examples: Polytrichum, Bryum, Mnium,\r\nHypnum, etc.)\r\n\r\n=528.= TABLE SHOWING RELATION OF GAMETOPHYTE AND SPOROPHYTE IN THE\r\nLIVERWORTS AND MOSSES.\r\n\r\n  ----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                                GAMETOPHYTE.\r\n         (Prominent part of the plant.

But they are\r\nalso very interesting to the student, because of certain remarkable\r\npeculiarities of the structure of the fruit bodies, and especially\r\nbecause of the intermediate position which they occupy within the\r\nplant kingdom, representing in the two phases of their development the\r\nprimitive type of plant life on the one hand, and on the other the\r\nmodern type. We will begin our study of the ferns by taking that form\r\nwhich is the more prominent, the fern plant itself.\r\n\r\n=530. The Christmas fern.=—One of the ferns which is very common\r\nin the Northern States, and occurs in rocky banks and woods, is the\r\nwell-known Christmas fern (Aspidium acrostichoides) shown in fig. 286.\r\nThe leaves are the most prominent part of the plant, as is the case\r\nwith most if not all our native ferns. The stem is very short and\r\nfor the most part under the surface of the ground, while the leaves\r\narise very close together, and thus form a rosette as they rise and\r\ngracefully bend outward. The leaf is elongate and reminds one somewhat\r\nof a plume with the pinnæ extending in two rows on opposite sides of\r\nthe midrib. These pinnæ alternate with one another, and at the base of\r\neach pinna is a little spur which projects upward from the upper edge.\r\nSuch a leaf is said to be pinnate. While all the leaves have the same\r\ngeneral outline, we notice that certain ones, especially those toward\r\nthe center of the rosette, are much narrower from the middle portion\r\ntoward the end. This is because of the shorter pinnæ here.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 286. Christmas fern (Aspidium acrostichoides).]\r\n\r\n=531. Fruit “dots” (sorus, indusium).=—If we examine the under\r\nside of such short pinnæ of the Christmas fern we see that there\r\nare two rows of small circular dots, one row on either side of the\r\npinna. These are called the “fruit dots,” or sori (a single one is a\r\nsorus). If we examine it with a low power of the microscope, or with\r\na pocket lens, we see that there is a circular disk which covers more\r\nor less completely very minute objects, usually the ends of the latter\r\nprojecting just beyond the edge if they are mature. This circular disk\r\nis what is called the _indusium_, and it is a special outgrowth of the\r\nepidermis of the leaf here for the protection of the spore-cases. These\r\nminute objects underneath are the fruit bodies, which in the case of\r\nthe ferns and their allies are called _sporangia_. This indusium in the\r\ncase of the Christmas fern, and also in some others, is attached to the\r\nleaf by means of a short slender stalk which is fastened to the middle\r\nof the under side of this shield, as seen in cross-section in fig. 292.\r\n\r\n=532. Sporangia.=—If we section through the leaf at one of the\r\nfruit dots, or if we tease off some of the sporangia so that the stalks\r\nare still attached, and examine them with the microscope, we can see\r\nthe form and structure of these peculiar bodies. Different views of a\r\nsporangium are shown in fig. 293. The slender portion is the stalk,\r\nand the larger part is the spore-case proper. We should examine the\r\nstructure of this spore-case quite carefully, since it will help us to\r\nunderstand better than we otherwise could the remarkable operations\r\nwhich it performs in scattering the spores.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 287. Rhizome with bases of leaves, and roots of the\r\nChristmas fern.]\r\n\r\n=533. Structure of a sporangium.=—If we examine one of the\r\nsporangia in side view as shown in fig. 293, we note a prominent row\r\nof cells which extend around the margin of the dorsal edge from near\r\nthe attachment of the stalk to the upper front angle. The cells are\r\nprominent because of the thick inner walls, and the thick radial walls\r\nwhich are perpendicular to the inner walls. The walls on the back of\r\nthis row and on its sides are very thin and membranous. We should make\r\nthis out carefully, for the structure of these cells is especially\r\nadapted to a special function which they perform. This row of cells is\r\ntermed the _annulus_, which means a little ring. While this is not a\r\ncomplete ring, in some other ferns the ring is nearly complete.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 288. Rhizome of sensitive fern (Onoclea\r\nsensibilis).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 289. Under side of pinna of Aspidium spinulosum\r\nshowing fruit dots (sori).]\r\n\r\n=534.= In the front of the sporangium is another peculiar group\r\nof cells. Two of the longer ones resemble the lips of some creature,\r\nand since the sporangium opens between them they are sometimes termed\r\nthe lip cells. These lip cells are connected with the upper end of the\r\nannulus on one side and with the upper end of the stalk on the other\r\nside by thin-walled cells, which may be termed connective cells, since\r\nthey hold each lip cell to its part of the opening sporangium. The\r\ncells on the side of the sporangium are also thin-walled. If we now\r\nexamine a sporangium from the back, or dorsal edge as we say, it will\r\nappear as in the left-hand figure. Here we can see how very prominent\r\nthe annulus is. It projects beyond the surface of the other cells of\r\nthe sporangium. The spores are contained inside this case.\r\n\r\n=535. Opening of the sporangium and dispersion of the spores.=—If\r\nwe take some fresh fruiting leaves of the Christmas fern, or of any one\r\nof many of the species of the true ferns just at the ripening of the\r\nspores, and place a portion of it on a piece of white paper in a dry\r\nroom, in a very short time we shall see that the paper is being dusted\r\nwith minute brown objects which fly out from the leaf. Now if we take\r\na portion of the same leaf and place it under the low power of the\r\nmicroscope, so that the full rounded sporangia can be seen, in a short\r\ntime we note that the sporangium opens, the upper half curls backward\r\nas shown in fig. 294, and soon it snaps quickly, to near its former\r\nposition, and the spores are at the same time thrown for a considerable\r\ndistance. This movement can sometimes be seen with the aid of a good\r\nhand lens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 290. Four pinnæ of adiantum, showing recurved\r\nmargins which cover the sporangia.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 291. Section through sorus of Polypodium vulgare\r\nshowing different stages of sporangium, and one multicellular capitate\r\nhair.]\r\n\r\n=536. How does this opening and snapping of the sporangium take\r\nplace?=—We are now more curious than ever to see just how this\r\nopening and snapping of the sporangium takes place. We should now mount\r\nsome of the fresh sporangia in water and cover with a cover glass for\r\nmicroscopic examination. A drop of glycerine should be placed at one\r\nside of the cover glass on the slip so that the edge of the glycerine\r\nwill come in touch with the water. Now as one looks through the\r\nmicroscope to watch the sporangia, the water should be drawn from under\r\nthe cover glass with the aid of some bibulous paper, like filter paper,\r\nplaced at the edge of the cover glass on the opposite side from the\r\nglycerine. As the glycerine takes the place of the water around the\r\nsporangia it draws the water out of the cells of the annulus, just as\r\nit took the water out of the cells of the spirogyra as we learned some\r\ntime ago. As the water is drawn out of these cells there is produced\r\na pressure from without, the atmospheric pressure upon the glycerine.\r\nThis causes the walls of these cells of the annulus to bend inward,\r\nbecause, as we have already learned, the glycerine does not pass\r\nthrough the walls nearly so fast as the water comes out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 292. Section through sorus and shield-shaped\r\nindusium of aspidium.]\r\n\r\n=537.= Now the structure of the cells of this annulus, as we have\r\nseen, is such that the inner walls and the perpendicular walls are\r\nstout, and consequently they do not bend or collapse when this pressure\r\nis brought to bear on the outside of the cells. The thin membranous\r\nwalls on the back (dorsal walls) and on the sides of the annulus,\r\nhowever, yield readily to the pressure and bend inward. This, as we\r\ncan readily see, pulls on the ends of each of the perpendicular walls\r\ndrawing them closer together. This shortens the outer surface of the\r\nannulus and causes it to first assume a nearly straight position, then\r\ncurve backward until it quite or nearly becomes doubled on itself. The\r\nsporangium opens between the lip cells on the front and the lateral\r\nwalls of the sporangium are torn directly across. The greater mass of\r\nspores are thus held in the upper end of the open sporangium, and when\r\nthe annulus has nearly doubled on itself it suddenly snaps back again\r\nin position. While treating with the glycerine we can see all this\r\nmovement take place. Each cell of the annulus acts independently, but\r\noften they all act in concert. When they do not all act in concert,\r\nsome of them snap sooner than others, and this causes the annulus to\r\nsnap in segments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 293. Rear, side, and front views of fern\r\nsporangium. _d_, _e_, annulus; _a_, lip cells.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 294. Dispersion of spores from sporangium of\r\nAspidium acrostichoides, showing different stages in the opening and\r\nsnapping of the annulus.]\r\n\r\n=538. The movements of the sporangium can take place in old and dried\r\nmaterial.=—If we have no fresh material to study the sporangium\r\nwith, we can use dried material, for the movements of the sporangia can\r\nbe well seen in dried material, provided it was collected at about the\r\ntime the sporangia are mature, that is at maturity, or soon afterward.\r\nWe take some of the dry sporangia (or we may wash the glycerine off\r\nthose which we have just studied) and mount them in water, and quickly\r\nexamine them with a microscope. We notice that in each cell of the\r\nannulus there is a small sphere of some gas. The water which bathes the\r\nwalls of the annulus is absorbed by some substance inside these cells.\r\nThis we can see because of the fact that this sphere of gas becomes\r\nsmaller and smaller until it is only a mere dot, when it disappears in\r\na twinkling. The water has been taken in under such pressure that it\r\nhas absorbed all the gas, and the farther pressure in most cases closes\r\nthe partly opened sporangium more completely.\r\n\r\n=539.= Now we should add glycerine again and draw out the water,\r\nwatching the sporangia at the same time. We see that the sporangia\r\nwhich have opened and snapped once will do it again. And so they may\r\nbe made to go through this operation several times in succession. We\r\nshould now note carefully the annulus, that is after the sporangia have\r\nopened by the use of glycerine. So soon as they have snapped in the\r\nglycerine we can see those minute spheres of gas again, and since there\r\nwas no air on the outside of the sporangia, but only glycerine, this\r\ngas must, it is reasoned, have been given up by the water before it was\r\nall drawn out of the cells.\r\n\r\n=540. The common polypody.=—We may now take up a few other ferns\r\nfor study. Another common fern is the polypody, one or more species of\r\nwhich have a very wide distribution. The stem of this fern is also not\r\nusually seen, but is covered with the leaves, except in the case of\r\nthose species which grow on the surface of rocks. The stem is slender\r\nand prostrate, and is covered with numerous brown scales. The leaves\r\nare pinnate in this fern also, but we find no difference between the\r\nfertile and sterile leaves (except in some rare cases). The fruit dots\r\noccupy much the same positions on the under side of the leaf that they\r\ndo in the Christmas fern, but we cannot find any indusium. In the place\r\nof an indusium are club-shaped hairs as shown in fig. 291. The enlarged\r\nends of these clubs reaching beyond the sporangia give some protection\r\nto them when they are young.\r\n\r\n=541. Other ferns.=—We might examine a series of ferns to see\r\nhow different they are in respect to the position which the fruit\r\ndots occupy on the leaf. The common brake, which sometimes covers\r\nextensive areas and becomes a troublesome weed, has a stout and smooth\r\nunderground stem (rhizome) which is often 12 to 20 _cm_ beneath the\r\nsurface of the soil. There is a long leaf stalk, which bears the\r\nlamina, the latter being several times pinnate. The margins of the\r\nfertile pinnæ are inrolled, and the sporangia are found protected\r\nunderneath in this long sorus along the margin of the pinna. The\r\nbeautiful maidenhair fern and its relatives have obovate pinnæ, and\r\nthe sori are situated in the same positions as in the brake. In other\r\nferns, as the walking fern, the sori are borne along by the side of the\r\nveins of the leaf.\r\n\r\n=542. Opening of the leaves of ferns.=—The leaves of ferns\r\nopen in a peculiar manner. The tip of the leaf is the last portion\r\ndeveloped, and the growing leaf appears as if it was rolled up as in\r\nfig. 287 of the Christmas fern. As the leaf elongates this portion\r\nunrolls.\r\n\r\n=543. Longevity of ferns.=—Most ferns live from year to year, by\r\ngrowth adding to the advance of the stem, while by decay of the older\r\nparts the stem shortens up behind. The leaves are short-lived, usually\r\ndying down each year, and a new set arising from the growing end of the\r\nstem. Often one can see just back or below the new leaves the old dead\r\nones of the past season, and farther back the remains of the petioles\r\nof still older leaves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 295. Cystopteris bulbifera, young plant growing\r\nfrom bulb. At right is young bulb in axil of pinna of leaf.]\r\n\r\n=544. Budding of ferns.=—A few ferns produce what are called\r\nbulbils or bulblets on the leaves. One of these, which is found\r\nthroughout the greater part of the eastern United States, is the\r\nbladder fern (Cystopteris bulbifera), which grows in shady rocky\r\nplaces. The long graceful delicate leaves form in the axils of the\r\npinnæ, especially near the end of the leaf, small oval bulbs as shown\r\nin fig. 295. If we examine one of these bladder-like bulbs we see\r\nthat the bulk of it is made up of short thick fleshy leaves, smaller\r\nones appearing between the outer ones at the smaller end of the bulb.\r\nThis bulb contains a stem, young root, and several pairs of these\r\nfleshy leaves. They easily fall to the ground or rocks, where, with\r\nthe abundant moisture usually present in localities where the fern is\r\nfound, the bulb grows until the roots attach the plant to the soil or\r\nin the crevices of the rocks. A young plant growing from one of these\r\nbulbils is shown in fig. 295.\r\n\r\n=545. Greenhouse ferns.=—Some of the ferns grown in\r\nconservatories have similar bulblets. Fig. 296 represents one of these\r\nwhich is found abundantly on the leaves of Asplenium bulbiferum. These\r\nbulbils have leaves which are very similar to the ordinary leaf except\r\nthat they are smaller. The bulbs are also much more firmly attached to\r\nthe leaf, so that they do not readily fall away.\r\n\r\n=546.= Plant conservatories usually furnish a number of very\r\ninteresting ferns, and one should attempt to make the acquaintance of\r\nsome of them, for here one has an opportunity during the winter season\r\nnot only to observe these interesting plants, but also to obtain\r\nmaterial for study. In the tree ferns which often are seen growing in\r\nsuch places we see examples of the massive trunks and leaves of some of\r\nthe tropical species.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 296. Bulbil growing from leaf of asplenium (_A_,\r\nbulbiferum).]\r\n\r\n=547. The fern plant is a sporophyte.=—We have now studied\r\nthe fern plant, as we call it, and we have found it to represent\r\nthe spore-bearing phase of the plant, that is the _sporophyte_\r\n(corresponding to the sporogonium of the liverworts and mosses).\r\n\r\n=548. Is there a gametophyte phase in ferns?=—But in the\r\nsporophyte of the fern, which we should not forget is the fern plant,\r\nwe have a striking advance upon the sporophyte of the liverworts and\r\nmosses. In the latter plants the sporophyte remained attached to the\r\ngametophyte, and derived its nourishment from it. In the ferns, as we\r\nsee, the sporophyte has a root of its own, and is attached to the soil.\r\nThrough the aid of root hairs of its own it takes up mineral solutions.\r\nIt possesses also a true stem, and true leaves in which carbon\r\nconversion takes place. It is able to live independently, then. Does\r\na gametophyte phase exist among the ferns? Or has it been lost? If it\r\ndoes exist, what is it like, and where does it grow? From what we have\r\nalready learned we should expect to find the gametophyte begin with the\r\ngermination of the spores which are developed on the sporophyte, that\r\nis on the fern plant itself. We should investigate this and see.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nFERNS CONTINUED.\r\n\r\n\r\nGametophyte of ferns.\r\n\r\n=549. Sexual stage of ferns.=—We now wish to see what the sexual\r\nstage of the ferns is like. Judging from what we have found to take\r\nplace in the liverworts and mosses we should infer that the form of the\r\nplant which bears the sexual organs is developed from the spores. This\r\nis true, and if we should examine old decaying logs, or decaying wood\r\nin damp places in the near vicinity of ferns, we should probably find\r\ntiny, green, thin, heart-shaped growths, lying close to the substratum.\r\nThese are also found quite frequently on the soil of pots in plant\r\nconservatories where ferns are grown. Gardeners also in conservatories\r\nusually sow fern spores to raise new fern plants, and usually one can\r\nfind these heart-shaped growths on the surface of the soil where they\r\nhave sown the spores. We may call the gardener to our aid in finding\r\nthem in conservatories, or even in growing them for us if we cannot\r\nfind them outside. In some cases they may be grown in an ordinary room\r\nby keeping the surfaces where they are growing moist, and the air also\r\nmoist, by placing a glass bell jar over them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 297. Prothallium of fern, under side, showing\r\nrhizoids, antheridia scattered among and near them, and the archegonia\r\nnear the sinus.]\r\n\r\n=550.= In fig. 297 is shown one of these growths enlarged. Upon\r\nthe under side we see numerous thread-like outgrowths, the rhizoids,\r\nwhich attach the plant to the substratum, and which act as organs for\r\nthe absorption of nourishment. The sexual organs are borne on the under\r\nside also, and we will study them later. This heart-shaped, flattened,\r\nthin, green plant is the _prothallium_ of ferns, and we should now give\r\nit more careful study, beginning with the germination of the spores.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 298. Spore of Pteris serrulata showing the\r\nthree-rayed elevation along the side of which the spore wall cracks\r\nduring germination.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 299. Spore of Aspidium acrostichoides with winged\r\nexospore.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 300. Spore crushed to remove exospore and show\r\nendospore.]\r\n\r\n=551. Spores.=—We can easily obtain material for the study of the\r\nspores of ferns. The spores vary in shape to some extent. Many of them\r\nare shaped like a three-sided pyramid. One of these is shown in fig.\r\n298. The outer wall is roughened, and on one end are three elevated\r\nridges which radiate from a given point. A spore of the Christmas fern\r\nis shown in fig. 299. The outer wall here is more or less winged. At\r\nfig. 300 is a spore of the same species from which the outer wall has\r\nbeen crushed, showing that there is an inner wall also. If possible we\r\nshould study the germination of the spores of some fern.\r\n\r\n=552. Germination of the spores.=—After the spores have been\r\nsown for about one week to ten days we should mount a few in water for\r\nexamination with the microscope in order to study the early stages. If\r\ngermination has begun, we find that here and there are short slender\r\ngreen threads, in many cases attached to brownish bits, the old walls\r\nof the spores. Often one will sow the sporangia along with the spores,\r\nand in such cases there may be found a number of spores still within\r\nthe old sporangium wall that are germinating, when they will appear as\r\nin fig. 302.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 301. Spores of asplenium; exospore removed from the\r\none at the right.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 302. Germinating spores of Pteris aquilina still in\r\nthe sporangium.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 303. Young prothallium of a fern (niphobolus).]\r\n\r\n=553. Protonema.=—These short green threads are called\r\n_protonemal_ threads, or _protonema_, which means a _first thread_, and\r\nit here signifies that this short thread only precedes a larger growth\r\nof the same object. In figs. 302, 303 are shown several stages of\r\ngermination of different spores. Soon after the short germ tube emerges\r\nfrom the crack in the spore wall, it divides by the formation of a\r\ncross wall, and as it increases in length other cross walls are formed.\r\nBut very early in its growth we see that a slender outgrowth takes\r\nplace from the cell nearest the old spore wall. This slender thread is\r\ncolorless, and is not divided into cells. It is the first rhizoid, and\r\nserves both as an organ of attachment for the thread, and for taking up\r\nnutriment.\r\n\r\n=554. Prothallium.=—Very soon, if the sowing has not been so\r\ncrowded as to prevent the young plants from obtaining nutriment\r\nsufficient, we will see that the end of this protonema is broadening,\r\nas shown in fig. 303. This is done by the formation of the cell walls\r\nin different directions. It now continues to grow in this way, the end\r\nbecoming broader and broader, and new rhizoids are formed from the\r\nunder surface of the cells. The growing point remains at the middle of\r\nthe advancing margin, and the cells which are cut off from either side,\r\nas they become old, widen out. In this way the “wings,” or margins of\r\nthe little, green, flattened body, are in advance of the growing point,\r\nand the object is more or less heart-shaped, as shown in fig. 297. Thus\r\nwe see how the prothallium of ferns is formed.\r\n\r\n=555. Sexual organs of ferns.=—If we take one of the prothallia\r\nof ferns which have grown from the sowings of fern spores, or one of\r\nthose which may be often found growing on the soil of pots in\r\nconservatories, mount it in water on a slip, with the under side\r\nuppermost, we can then examine it for the sexual organs, for these are\r\nborne in most cases on the under side.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 304. Male prothallium of a fern (niphobolus), in\r\nform of an alga or protonema. Spermatozoids escaping from antheridia.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 305. Male prothallium of fern (niphobolus), showing\r\nopened and unopened antheridia; section of unopened antheridium;\r\nspermatozoids escaping; spermatozoids which did not escape from the\r\nantheridium.]\r\n\r\n=556. Antheridia.=—If we search among the rhizoids we see small\r\nrounded elevations as shown in fig. 297 or 305 scattered over this\r\nportion of the prothallium. These are the antheridia. If the prothallia\r\nhave not been watered for a day or so, we may have an opportunity of\r\nseeing the spermatozoids coming out of the antheridium, for when the\r\nprothallia are freshly placed in water the cells of the antheridium\r\nabsorb water. This presses on the contents of the antheridium\r\nand bursts the cap cell if the antheridium is ripe, and all the\r\nspermatozoids are shot out. We can see here that each one is shaped\r\nlike a screw, with the coils at first close. But as the spermatozoid\r\nbegins to move this coil opens somewhat and by the vibration of the\r\nlong cilia which are on the smaller end it whirls away. In such\r\npreparations one may often see them spinning around for a long while,\r\nand it is only when they gradually come to rest that one can make out\r\ntheir form.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 306. Section of antheridia showing sperm cells, and\r\nspermatozoids in the one at the right.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 307. Different views of spermatozoids; in a quiet\r\ncondition; in motion (Adiantum concinnum).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 308. Archegonium of fern. Large cell in the center\r\nis the egg, next is the ventral canal cell, and in the canal of the\r\nneck are two nuclei of the canal cell.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 309. Mature and open archegonium of fern (Adiantum\r\ncuneatum) with spermatozoids making their way down through the slime to\r\nthe egg.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 310. Fertilization in a fern (Marattia). _sp_,\r\nspermatozoid fusing with the nucleus of the egg. (After Campbell.)]\r\n\r\n=557. Archegonia.=—If we now examine closely on the thicker part\r\nof the under surface of the prothallium, just back of the “sinus,” we\r\nmay see longer stout projections from the surface of the prothallium.\r\nThese are shown in fig. 297. They are the archegonia. One of them in\r\nlongisection is shown in fig. 308. It is flask-shaped, and the broader\r\nportion is sunk in the tissue of the prothallium. The egg is in the\r\nlarger part. The spermatozoids when they are swimming around over the\r\nunder surface of the prothallium come near the neck, and here they are\r\ncaught in the viscid substance which has oozed out of the canal of the\r\narchegonium. From here they slowly swim down the canal, and finally one\r\nsinks into the egg, fuses with the nucleus of the latter, and the egg\r\nis then fertilized. It is now ready to grow and develop into the fern\r\nplant. This brings us back to the sporophyte, which begins with the\r\nfertilized egg.\r\n\r\n\r\nSporophyte.\r\n\r\n=558. Embryo.=—The egg first divides into two cells as shown in\r\nfig. 228, then into four. Now from each one of these quadrants of the\r\nembryo a definite part of the plant develops, from one the first leaf,\r\nfrom one the stem, from one the root, and from the other the organ\r\nwhich is called the foot, and which attaches the embryo to the\r\nprothallium, and transports nourishment for the embryo until it can\r\nbecome attached to the soil and lead an independent existence. During\r\nthis time the wall of the archegonium grows somewhat to accommodate the\r\nincrease in size of the embryo, as shown in figs. 312, 313. But soon\r\nthe wall of the archegonium is ruptured and the embryo emerges, the\r\nroot attaches itself to the soil, and soon the prothallium dies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 311. Two-celled embryo of Pteris serrulata. Remnant\r\nof archegonium neck below.]\r\n\r\nThe embryo is first on the under side of the prothallium, and the first\r\nleaf and the stem curves upward between the lobes of the heart-shaped\r\nbody, and then grows upright as shown in fig. 314. Usually only one\r\nembryo is formed on a single prothallium, but in one case I found a\r\nprothallium with two well-formed embryos, which are figured in 315.\r\n\r\n=559. Comparison of ferns with liverworts and mosses.=—In the\r\nferns then we have reached a remarkable condition of things as compared\r\nwith that which we found in the mosses and liverworts. In the mosses\r\nand liverworts the sexual phase of the plant (gametophyte) was the\r\nprominent one, and consisted of either a thallus or a leafy axis,\r\nbut in either case it bore the sexual organs and led an independent\r\nexistence; that is it was capable of obtaining its nourishment from the\r\nsoil or water by means of organs of absorption belonging to itself, and\r\nit also performed the office of photosynthesis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 312. Young embryo of fern (Adiantum concinnum)\r\nin enlarged venter of the archegonium. _S_, stem; _L_, first leaf or\r\ncotyledon; _R_, root; _F_, foot.]\r\n\r\n=560.= The spore-bearing phase (sporophyte) of the liverworts\r\nand mosses, on the other hand, is quite small as compared with the\r\nsexual stage, and it is completely dependent on the sexual stage for\r\nits nourishment, remaining attached permanently throughout all its\r\ndevelopment, by means of the organ called a foot, and it dies after the\r\nspores are mature.\r\n\r\n=561.= Now in the ferns we see several striking differences. In\r\nthe first place, as we have already observed, the spore-bearing phase\r\n(sporophyte) of the plant is the prominent one, and that which\r\ncharacterizes the plant. It also leads an independent existence, and,\r\nwith the exception of a few cases, does not die after the development\r\nof the spores, but lives from year to year and develops successive\r\ncrops of spores. There is a _distinct advance_ here in the _size_,\r\n_complexity_, and _permanency_ of this phase of the plant.\r\n\r\n=562.= On the other hand the sexual phase of the ferns\r\n(gametophyte), while it still is capable of leading an independent\r\nexistence, is short-lived (with very few exceptions). It is also much\r\nsmaller than most of the liverworts and mosses, especially as compared\r\nwith the size of the spore-bearing phase. The gametophyte phase or\r\nstage of the plants, then, is decreasing in size and durance as the\r\nsporophyte stage is increasing. We shall be interested to see if this\r\nholds good of the fern allies, that is of the plants which belong to\r\nthe same group as the ferns. And as we come later to take up the study\r\nof the higher plants we must bear in mind to carry on this comparison,\r\nand see if this progression on the one hand of the sporophyte\r\ncontinues, and if the retrogression of the gametophyte continues also.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 313.

Young plant of Pteris serrulata still attached\r\nto prothallium.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 315. Two embryos from one prothallium of Adiantum\r\ncuneatum.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nDIMORPHISM OF FERNS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=563.= In comparing the different members of the leaf series there\r\nare often striking illustrations of the transition from one form to\r\nanother, as we have noted in the case of the trillium flower. This\r\noccurs in many other flowers, and in some, as in the water-lily, these\r\ntransformations are always present, here showing a transition from the\r\npetals to the stamens. In the bud-scales of many plants, as in the\r\nbutternut, walnut, currant, etc., there are striking gradations between\r\nthe form of the simple bud-scales and the form of the leaf. Some of the\r\nmost interesting of these transformations are found in the dimorphic\r\nferns.\r\n\r\n=564. Dimorphism in the leaves of ferns.=—In the common polypody\r\nfern, the maidenhair, and in many other ferns, all the leaves are of\r\nthe same form. That is, there is no difference between the fertile leaf\r\nand the sterile leaf. On the other hand, in the case of the Christmas\r\nfern we have seen that the fertile leaves are slightly different from\r\nthe sterile leaves, the former having shorter pinnæ on the upper half\r\nof the leaf. The fertile pinnæ are here the shorter ones, and perform\r\nbut little of the function of carbon conversion. This function is\r\nchiefly performed by the sterile leaves and by the sterile portions of\r\nthe fertile leaves. This is a short step toward the division of labor\r\nbetween the two kinds of leaves, one performing chiefly the labor of\r\ncarbon conversion, the other chiefly the labor of bearing the fruit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 316. Sensitive fern; normal condition of vegetative\r\nleaves and sporophylls.]\r\n\r\n=565. The sensitive fern.=—This division of labor is carried to\r\nan extreme extent in the case of some ferns. Some of our native ferns\r\nare examples of this interesting relation between the leaves like\r\nthe common sensitive fern (Onoclea sensibilis) and the ostrich fern\r\n(O. struthiopteris) and the cinnamon-fern (Osmunda cinnamomea). The\r\nsensitive fern is here shown in fig. 316. The sterile leaves are large,\r\nbroadly expanded, and pinnate, the pinnæ being quite large. The fertile\r\nleaves are shown also in the figure, and at first one would not take\r\nthem for leaves at all. But if we examine them carefully we see that\r\nthe general plan of the leaf is the same: the two rows of pinnæ which\r\nare here much shorter than in the sterile leaf, and the pinnules, or\r\nsmaller divisions of the pinnæ, are inrolled into little spherical\r\nmasses which lie close on the side of the pinnæ. If we unroll one\r\nof these pinnules we find that there are several fruit dots within\r\nprotected by this roll. In fact when the spores are mature these\r\npinnules open somewhat, so that the spores may be disseminated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 317. Sensitive fern; one fertile leaf nearly\r\nchanged to vegetative leaf.]\r\n\r\nThere is very little green color in these fertile leaves, and what\r\ngreen surface there is is very small compared with that of the broad\r\nexpanse of the sterile leaves. So here there is practically a complete\r\ndivision of labor between these two kinds of leaves, the general plan\r\nof which is the same, and we recognize each as being a leaf.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 318. Sensitive fern, showing one vegetative leaf\r\nand two sporophylls completely transformed.]\r\n\r\n=566. Transformation of the fertile leaves of onoclea to sterile\r\nones.=—It is not a very rare thing to find plants of the sensitive\r\nfern which show intermediate conditions of the sterile and the\r\nfertile leaf. A number of years ago it was thought by some that this\r\nrepresented a different species, but now it is known that these\r\nintermediate forms are partly transformed fertile leaves. It is a\r\nvery easy matter in the case of the sensitive fern to produce these\r\ntransformations by experiment. If one in the spring, when the sterile\r\nleaves attain a height of 12 to 16 _cm_ (8-10 inches), cuts them away,\r\nand again when they have a second time reached the same height, some\r\nof the fruiting leaves which develop later will be transformed. A few\r\nyears ago I cut off the sterile leaves from quite a large patch of\r\nthe sensitive fern, once in May, and again in June. In July, when\r\nthe fertile leaves were appearing above the ground, many of them\r\nwere changed partly or completely into sterile leaves. In all some\r\nthirty plants showed these transformations, so that every conceivable\r\ngradation was obtained between the two kinds of leaves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 319. Normal and transformed sporophyll of sensitive\r\nfern.]\r\n\r\n=567.= It is quite interesting to note the form of these changed\r\nleaves carefully, to see how this change has affected the pinnæ and the\r\nsporangia. We note that the tip of the leaf as well as the tips of all\r\nthe pinnæ are more expanded than the basal portions of the same.\r\nThis is due to the fact that the tip of the leaf develops later\r\nthan the basal portions. At the time the stimulus to the change in\r\nthe development of the fertile leaves reached them they were partly\r\nformed, that is the basal parts of the fertile leaves were more or less\r\ndeveloped and fixed and could not change. Those portions of the leaf,\r\nhowever, which were not yet completely formed, under this stimulus, or\r\nthrough correlation of growth, are incited to vegetative growth, and\r\nexpand more or less completely into vegetative leaves.\r\n\r\n=568. The sporangia decrease as the fertile leaf expands.=—If\r\nwe now examine the sporangia on the successive pinnæ of a partly\r\ntransformed leaf we find that in case the lower pinnæ are not changed\r\nat all, the sporangia are normal. But as we pass to the pinnæ which\r\nshow increasing changes, that is those which are more and more\r\nexpanded, we see that the number of sporangia decrease, and many of\r\nthem are sterile, that is they bear no spores. Farther up there are\r\nonly rudiments of sporangia, until on the more expanded pinnæ sporangia\r\nare no longer formed, but one may still see traces of the indusium.\r\nOn some of the changed leaves the only evidences that the leaf began\r\nonce to form a fertile leaf are the traces of these indusia. In some of\r\nthese cases the transformed leaf was even larger than the sterile leaf.\r\n\r\n=569. The ostrich fern.=—Similar changes were also produced in\r\nthe case of the ostrich fern, and in fig. 319 is shown at the left a\r\nnormal fertile leaf, then one partly changed, and at the right one\r\ncompletely transformed.\r\n\r\n=570. Dimorphism in tropical ferns.=—Very interesting forms\r\nof dimorphism are seen in some of the tropical ferns. One of these\r\nis often seen growing in plant conservatories, and is known as the\r\nstaghorn fern (Platycerium alcicorne). This in nature grows attached to\r\nthe trunks of quite large trees at considerable elevations on the tree,\r\nsometimes surrounding the tree with a massive growth. One kind of leaf,\r\nwhich may be either fertile or sterile, is narrow, and branched in a\r\npeculiar manner, so that it resembles somewhat the branching of the\r\nhorn of a stag. Below these are other leaves which are different in\r\nform and sterile. These leaves are broad and hug closely around the\r\nroots and bases of the other leaves. Here they serve to catch and\r\nretain moisture, and they also catch leaves and other vegetable matter\r\nwhich falls from the trees. In this position the leaves decay and then\r\nserve as food for the fern.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 320. Ostrich fern, showing one normal sporophyll,\r\none partly transformed, and one completely transformed.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nHORSETAILS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=571.= Among the relatives of the ferns are the horsetails, so\r\ncalled because of the supposed resemblance of the branched stems of\r\nsome of the species to a horse’s tail, as one might infer from the\r\nplant shown in fig. 325. They do not bear the least resemblance to the\r\nferns which we have been studying. But then relationship in plants does\r\nnot depend on mere resemblance of outward form, or of the prominent\r\npart of the plant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 321. Portion of fertile plant of Equisetum arvense\r\nshowing whorls of leaves and the fruiting spike.]\r\n\r\n=572. The field equisetum. Fertile shoots.=—Fig. 321 represents\r\nthe common horsetail (Equisetum arvense). It grows in moist sandy\r\nor gravelly places, and the fruiting portion of the plant (for this\r\nspecies is dimorphic), that is the portion which bears the spores,\r\nappears above the ground early in the spring. It is one of the first\r\nthings to peep out of the recently frozen ground. This fertile shoot\r\nof the plant does not form its growth this early in the spring. Its\r\ndevelopment takes place under the ground in the autumn, so that with\r\nthe advent of spring it pushes up without delay. This shoot is from\r\n10 to 20 _cm_. high, and at quite regular intervals there are slight\r\nenlargements, the nodes of the stem. The cylindrical portions between\r\nthe nodes are the internodes. If we examine the region of the\r\ninternodes carefully we note that there are thin membranous scales,\r\nmore or less triangular in outline, and connected at their bases into a\r\nring around the stem. Curious as it may seem, these are the leaves of\r\nthe horsetail. The stem, if we examine it farther, will be seen to\r\npossess numerous ridges which extend lengthwise and which alternate\r\nwith furrows. Farther, the ridges of one node alternate with those of\r\nthe internode both above and below. Likewise the leaves of one node\r\nalternate with those of the nodes both above and below.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 322. Peltate sporophyll of equisetum (side view)\r\nshowing sporangia on under side.]\r\n\r\n=573. Sporangia.=—The end of this fertile shoot we see possesses\r\na cylindrical to conic enlargement. This is the _fertile spike_, and we\r\nnote that its surface is marked off into regular areas if the spores\r\nhave not yet been disseminated. If we dissect off a few of these\r\nportions of the fertile spike, and examine one of them with a low\r\nmagnifying power, it will appear like the fig. 322. We see here that\r\nthe angular area is a disk-shaped body, with a stalk attached to its\r\ninner surface, and with several long sacs projecting from its inner\r\nface parallel with the stalk and surrounding the same. These elongated\r\nsacs are the _sporangia_, and the disk which bears them, together with\r\nthe stalk which attaches it to the stem axis, is the _sporophyll_, and\r\nthus belongs to the leaf series. These sporophylls are borne in close\r\nwhorls on the axis.\r\n\r\n=574. Spores.=—When the spores are ripe the tissue of the\r\nsporangium becomes dry, and it cracks open and the spores fall out.\r\nIf we look at fig. 323 we see that the spore is covered with a very\r\nsingular coil which lies close to the wall. When the spore dries this\r\nuncoils and thus rolls the spore about. Merely breathing upon these\r\nspores is sufficient to make them perform very curious evolutions by\r\nthe twisting of these four coils which are attached to one place of the\r\nwall. They are formed by the splitting up of an outer wall of the spore.\r\n\r\n=575. Sterile shoot of the common horsetail.=—When the spores are\r\nripe they are soon scattered, and then the fertile shoot dies down.\r\nSoon afterward, or even while some of the fertile shoots are still in\r\ngood condition, sterile shoots of the plant begin to appear above the\r\nground. One of these is shown in fig. 325. This has a much more slender\r\nstem and is provided with numerous branches. If we examine the stem of\r\nthis shoot, and of the branches, we see that the same kind of leaves\r\nare present and that the markings on the stem are similar. Since the\r\nleaves of the horsetail are membranous and not green, the stem is green\r\nin color, and this performs the function of photosynthesis. These green\r\nshoots live for a great part of the season, building up material which\r\nis carried down into the underground stems, where it goes to supply the\r\nforming fertile shoots in the fall. On digging up some of these plants\r\nwe see that the underground stems are often of great extent, and that\r\nboth fertile and sterile shoots are attached to one and the same.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 323. Spore of equisetum with elaters coiled up.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 324. Spore of equisetum with elaters uncoiled.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 325. Sterile plant of horsetail (Equisetum\r\narvensis).]\r\n\r\n=576. The scouring rush, or shave grass.=—Another common species\r\nof horsetail in the Northern States grows on wet banks, or in sandy\r\nsoil which contains moisture along railroad embankments. It is the\r\nscouring rush (E. hyemale), so called because it was once used for\r\npolishing purposes. This plant like all the species of the horsetails\r\nhas underground stems. But unlike the common horsetail, there is but\r\none kind of aerial shoot, which is green in color and fertile. The\r\nshoots range as high as one meter or more, and are quite stout. The new\r\nshoots which come up for the year are unbranched, and bear the fertile\r\nspike at the apex. When the spores are ripe the apex of the shoot dies,\r\nand the next season small branches may form from a number of the nodes.\r\n\r\n=577. Gametophyte of equisetum.=—The spores of equisetum have\r\nchlorophyll when they are mature, and they are capable of germinating\r\nas soon as mature. The spores are all of the same kind as regards size,\r\njust as we found in the case of the ferns. But they develop prothallia\r\nof different sizes, according to the amount of nutriment which they\r\nobtain. Those which obtain but little nutriment are smaller and develop\r\nonly antheridia, while those which obtain more nutriment become larger,\r\nmore or less branched, and develop archegonia. This character of an\r\nindependent prothallium (gametophyte) with the characteristic sexual\r\norgans, and the also independent sporophyte, with spores, shows the\r\nrelationship of the horsetails with the ferns. We thus see that these\r\ncharacters of the reproductive organs, and the phases and fruiting of\r\nthe plant, are more essential in determining relationships of plants\r\nthan the mere outward appearances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nCLUB MOSSES.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 326. Lycopodium clavatum, branch bearing two\r\nfruiting spikes; at right sporophyll with open sporangium; single spore\r\nnear it.]\r\n\r\n=578.= What are called the “club mosses” make up another group\r\nof interesting plants which rank as allies of the ferns. They are not\r\nof course true mosses, but the general habit of some of the smaller\r\nspecies, and especially the form and size of the leaves, suggest a\r\nresemblance to the larger of the moss plants.\r\n\r\n=579. The clavate lycopodium.=—Here is one of the club mosses\r\n(fig. 326) which has a wide distribution and which is well entitled to\r\nhold the name of club because of the form of the upright club-shaped\r\nbranches. As will be seen from the illustration, it has a prostrate\r\nstem. This stem runs for considerable distances on the surface of the\r\nground, often partly buried in the leaves, and sometimes even buried\r\nbeneath the soil. The leaves are quite small, are flattened-awl-shaped,\r\nand stand thickly over the stem, arranged in a spiral manner, which\r\nis the usual arrangement of the leaves of the club mosses. Here and\r\nthere are upright branches which are forked several times. The end of\r\none or more of these branches becomes produced into a slender upright\r\nstem which is nearly leafless, the leaves being reduced to mere scales.\r\nThe end of this leafless branch then terminates in one or several\r\ncylindrical heads which form the club.\r\n\r\n=580. Fruiting spike of Lycopodium clavatum.=—This club is the\r\nfruiting spike or head (sometimes termed a _strobilus_). Here the\r\nleaves are larger again and broader, but still not so large as the\r\nleaves on the creeping shoots, and they are paler. If we bend down some\r\nof the leaves, or tear off a few, we see that in the axil of the leaf,\r\nwhere it joins the stem, there is a somewhat rounded, kidney-shaped\r\nbody. This is the spore-case or sporangium, as we can see by an\r\nexamination of its contents. There is but a single spore-case for each\r\nof the fertile leaves (sporophyll). When it is mature, it opens by a\r\ncrosswise slit as seen in fig. 326. When we consider the number of\r\nspore-cases in one of these club-shaped fruit bodies we see that the\r\nnumber of spores developed in a large plant is immense. In mass the\r\nspores make a very fine, soft powder, which is used for some kinds of\r\npyrotechnic material, and for various toilet purposes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 327. Lycopodium lucidulum, bulbils in axils of\r\nleaves near the top, sporangia in axils of leaves below them. At right\r\nis a bulbil enlarged.]\r\n\r\n=581. Lycopodium lucidulum.=—Another common species is figured\r\nat 327. This is Lycopodium lucidulum. The habit of the plant is quite\r\ndifferent. It grows in damp ravines, woods, and moors. The older\r\nparts of the stem are prostrate, while the branches are more or less\r\nascending. It branches in a forked manner. The leaves are larger than\r\nin the former species, and they are all of the same size, there being\r\nno appreciable difference between the sterile and fertile ones. The\r\ncharacteristic club is not present here, but the spore-cases occupy\r\ncertain regions of the stem, as shown at 327. In a single season one\r\nregion of the stem may bear spore-cases, and then a sterile portion\r\nof the same stem is developed, which later bears another series of\r\nspore-cases higher up.\r\n\r\n=582. Bulbils on Lycopodium lucidulum.=—There is one curious way\r\nin which this club moss multiplies. One may see frequently among the\r\nupper leaves small wedge-shaped or heart-shaped green bodies but little\r\nlarger than the ordinary leaves. These are little buds which contain\r\nrudimentary shoot and root and several thick green leaves. When they\r\nfall to the ground they grow into new lycopodium plants, just as the\r\nbulbils of cystopteris do which were described in the chapter on ferns.\r\n\r\n=583.= Note.—The prothallia of the species of lycopodium which\r\nhave been studied are singular objects. In L. cernuum a cylindrical\r\nbody sunk in the earth is formed, and from the upper surface there\r\nare green lobes. In L. phlegmaria and some others slender branched,\r\ncolorless bodies are formed which according to Treub grow as a\r\nsaphrophyte in decayed bark of trees. Many of the prothallia examined\r\nhave a fungus growing in their tissue which is supposed to play some\r\npart in the nutrition of the prothallium.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe little club mosses (selaginella).\r\n\r\n=584.= Closely related to the club mosses are the selaginellas.\r\nThese plants resemble closely the general habit of the club mosses, but\r\nare generally smaller and the leaves more delicate. Some species are\r\ngrown in conservatories for ornament, the leaves of such usually having\r\na beautiful metallic lustre. The leaves of some are arranged as in\r\nlycopodium, but many species have the leaves in four to six rows. Fig.\r\n328 represents a part of a selaginella plant (S. apus). The fruiting\r\nspike possesses similar leaves, but they are shorter, and their\r\narrangement gives to the spike a four-sided appearance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 328. Selaginella with three fruiting spikes.\r\n(Selaginella apus.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 329. Fruiting spike showing large and small\r\nsporangia.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 330. Large sporangium.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 331. Small sporangium.]\r\n\r\n=585. Sporangia.=—On examining the fruiting spike, we find as\r\nin lycopodium that there is but a single sporangium in the axil of a\r\nfertile leaf. But we see that they are of two different kinds, small\r\nones in the axils of the upper leaves, and large ones in the axils of\r\na few of the lower leaves of the spike. The _microspores_ are borne\r\nin the smaller spore-cases and the _macrospores_ in the larger ones.\r\nFigures 329-331 give the details. There are many microspores in a\r\nsingle small spore-case, but 3-4 macrospores in a large spore-case.\r\n\r\n=586. Male prothallia.=—The prothallia of selaginella are much\r\nreduced structures. The microspores when mature are already divided\r\ninto two cells. When they grow into the mature prothallium a few more\r\ncells are formed, and some of the inner ones form the spermatozoids,\r\nas seen in fig. 332. Here we see that the antheridium itself is larger\r\nthan the prothallia. Only antheridia are developed on the prothallia\r\nformed from the microspores, and for this reason the prothallia are\r\ncalled _male prothallia_. In fact a male prothallium of selaginella is\r\nnearly all antheridium, so reduced has the gametophyte become here.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 332. Details of microspore and male prothallium\r\nof selaginella; 1st, microspore; 2d, wall removed to show small\r\nprothallial cell below; 3d, mature male prothallium still within the\r\nwall; 4th, small cell below is the prothallial cell, the remainder is\r\nantheridium with wall and four sperm cells within; 5th spermatozoid.\r\nAfter Beliaieff and Pfeffer.]\r\n\r\n=587. Female prothallia.=—The female prothallia are developed\r\nfrom the macrospores. The macrospores when mature have a rough, thick,\r\nhard wall. The female prothallium begins to develop inside of the\r\nmacrospore before it leaves the sporangium. The protoplasm is richer\r\nnear the wall of the spore and at the upper end. Here the nucleus\r\ndivides a great many times, and finally cell walls are formed, so\r\nthat a tissue of considerable extent is formed inside the wall of the\r\nspore, which is very different from what takes place in the ferns we\r\nhave studied. As the prothallium matures the spore is cracked at the\r\npoint where the three angles meet, as shown in fig. 334. The archegonia\r\nare developed in this exposed surface, and several can be seen in the\r\nillustration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 333. Section of mature macrospore of selaginella,\r\nshowing female prothallium and archegonia. After Pfeffer.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 334. Mature female prothallium of selaginella,\r\njust bursting open the wall of macrospore, exposing archegonia. After\r\nPfeffer.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 335. Seedling of selaginella still attached to the\r\nmacrospore. After Campbell.]\r\n\r\n=588. Embryo.=—After fertilization the egg divides in such a way\r\nthat a long cell called a suspensor is cut off from the upper side,\r\nwhich elongates and pushes the developing embryo down into the center\r\nof the spore, or what is now the female prothallium. Here it derives\r\nnourishment from the tissues of the prothallium, and eventually the\r\nroot and stem emerge, while a process called the “foot” is still\r\nattached to the prothallium. When the root takes hold on the soil the\r\nembryo becomes free.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nQUILLWORTS (ISOETES).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 336. Isoetes, mature plant, sporophyte stage.]\r\n\r\n=589.= The quillworts, as they are popularly called, are very\r\ncurious plants. They grow in wet marshy places. They receive their\r\nname from the supposed resemblance of the leaf to a quill. Fig. 336\r\nrepresents one of these quillworts (Isoetes engelmannii). The leaves\r\nare the prominent part of the plant, and they are about all that can\r\nbe seen except the roots, without removing the leaves. Each leaf, it\r\nwill be seen, is long and needle-like, except the basal part, which\r\nis expanded, not very unlike, in outline, a scale of an onion. These\r\nexpanded basal portions of the leaves closely overlap each other, and\r\nthe very short stem is completely covered at all times. Fig. 338 is\r\nfrom a longitudinal section of a quillwort. It shows the form of the\r\nleaves from this view (side view), and also the general outline of the\r\nshort stem, which is triangular. The stem is therefore a very short\r\nobject.\r\n\r\n=590. Sporangia of isoetes.=—If we pull off some of the leaves of\r\nthe plant we see that they are somewhat spoon-shaped as in fig. 337. In\r\nthe inner surface of the expanded base we note a circular depression\r\nwhich seems to be of a different texture from the other portions of the\r\nleaf. This is a _sporangium_. Beside the spores on the inside of the\r\nsporangium, there are strands of sterile tissue which extend across the\r\ncavity. This is peculiar to isoetes of all the members of the class\r\nof plants to which the ferns belong, but it will be remembered that\r\nsterile strands of tissue are found in some of the liverworts in the\r\nform of elaters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 337. Base of leaf of isoetes, showing sporangium\r\nwith macrospores. (Isoetes engelmannii.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 338. Section of plant of Isoetes engelmannii,\r\nshowing cup-shaped stem, and longitudinal sections of the sporangia in\r\nthe thickened bases of the leaves.]\r\n\r\n=591.= The spores of isoetes are of two kinds, small ones\r\n(microspores) and large ones (macrospores), so that in this respect\r\nit agrees with selaginella, though it is so very different in other\r\nrespects. When one kind of spore is borne in a sporangium usually all\r\nin that sporangium are of the same kind, so that certain sporangia\r\nbear microspores, and others bear macrospores. But it is not uncommon\r\nto find both kinds in the same sporangium. When a sporangium bears\r\nonly microspores the number is much greater than when one bears only\r\nmacrospores.\r\n\r\n=592.= If we examine some of the microspores of isoetes we see\r\nthat they are shaped like the quarters of an apple, that is they are of\r\nthe bilateral type as seen in some of the ferns (asplenium).\r\n\r\n=593. Male prothallia.=—In isoetes, as in selaginella, the\r\nmicrospores develop only male prothallia, and these are very\r\nrudimentary, one division of the spore having taken place before the\r\nspore is mature, just as in selaginella.\r\n\r\n=594. Female prothallia.=—These are developed from the\r\nmacrospores. The latter are of the tetrahedral type. The development\r\nof the female prothallium takes place in much the same way as in\r\nselaginella, the entire prothallium being enclosed in the macrospore,\r\nthough the cell divisions take place after it has left the sporangium.\r\nWhen the archegonia begin to develop the macrospore cracks at the three\r\nangles and the surface bearing the archegonia projects slightly as in\r\nselaginella. Absorbing organs in the form of rhizoids are very rarely\r\nformed.\r\n\r\n=595. Embryo.=—The embryo lies well immersed in the tissue of the\r\nprothallium, though there is no suspensor developed as in selaginella.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\nCOMPARISON OF FERNS AND THEIR RELATIVES.\r\n\r\n\r\n=596. Comparison of selaginella and isoetes with the ferns.=—On\r\ncomparing selaginella and isoetes with the ferns, we see that the\r\nsporophyte is, as in the ferns, the prominent part of the plant. It\r\npossesses root, stem, and leaves. While these plants are not so large\r\nin size as some of the ferns, still we see that there has been a great\r\nadvance in the sporophyte of selaginella and isoetes upon what exists\r\nin the ferns. There is a division of labor between the sporophylls,\r\nin which some of them bear microsporangia with microspores, and some\r\nbear macrosporangia with only macrospores. In the ferns and horsetails\r\nthere is only one kind of sporophyll, sporangium, and spore in a\r\nspecies. By this division of labor, or differentiation, between the\r\nsporophylls, one kind of spore, the microspore, is compelled to form\r\na male prothallium, while the other kind of spore, the macrospore, is\r\ncompelled to form a female prothallium. This represents a progression\r\nof the sporophyte of a very important nature.\r\n\r\n=597.= On comparing the gametophyte of selaginella and isoetes\r\nwith that of the ferns, we see that there has been a still farther\r\nretrogression in size from that which we found in the independent and\r\nlarge gametophyte of the liverworts and mosses. In the ferns, while it\r\nis reduced, it still forms rhizoids, and leads an independent life,\r\nabsorbing its own nutrient materials, and assimilating carbon. In\r\nselaginella and isoetes the gametophyte does not escape from the spore,\r\nnor does it form absorbing organs, nor develop assimilative tissue.\r\nThe reduced prothallium develops at the expense of food stored by the\r\nsporophyte while the spore is developing. Thus, while the gametophyte\r\nis separate from the sporophyte in selaginella and isoetes, it is\r\nreally dependent on it for support or nourishment.\r\n\r\n=598.= The important general characters possessed by the ferns\r\nand their so-called allies, as we have found, are as follows: The\r\nspore-bearing part, which is the fern plant, leads an independent\r\nexistence from the prothallium, and forms root, stem, and leaves. The\r\nspores are borne in sporangia on the leaves. The prothallium also leads\r\nan independent existence, though in isoetes and selaginella it has\r\nbecome almost entirely dependent on the sporophyte. The prothallium\r\nbears also well-developed antheridia and archegonia. The root, stem,\r\nand leaves of the sporophyte possess vascular tissue. All the ferns and\r\ntheir allies agree in the possession of these characters. The mosses\r\nand liverworts have well-developed antheridia and archegonia, and the\r\nhigher plants have vascular tissue. But no plant of either of these\r\ngroups possesses the combined characters which we find in the ferns and\r\ntheir relatives. The latter are, therefore, the fern-like plants, or\r\n_pteridophyta_. The living forms of the pteridophyta are classified as\r\nfollows into families or orders.

Four orders may be recognized.\r\n\r\n=600. Order Ophioglossales.= (One Family, Ophioglossaceæ).—This\r\norder includes the grapeferns (Botrychium), so called because of the\r\nlarge botryoid cluster of sporangia, resembling roughly a cluster\r\nof grapes; and the adder-tongue (Ophioglossum), the sporangia being\r\nembedded in a long tongue-like outgrowth from the green leaf.\r\nBotrychium and Ophioglossum are widely distributed. The roots are\r\nfleshy, nearly destitute of root hairs, and contain an endophytic\r\nfungus, so that the roots are mycorhiza. The gametophyte is\r\nsubterranean, and devoid of chlorophyll. In Botrychium virginianum,\r\nan endophytic fungus has been found in the prothallium. Another genus\r\n(Helminthostachys) with one species is limited to the East Indies.\r\n\r\n=601. Order Marattiales= (One Family, Marattiaceæ).—These are\r\ntropical ferns, with only four or five living genera (Marattia, Danæa,\r\netc.). They resemble the typical ferns, but the sporangia are usually\r\nunited, several forming a compound sporangium, or _synangium_.\r\n\r\nThe Ophioglossales and Marattiales are known as eusporangiate ferns,\r\nwhile the following order includes the leptosporangiate ferns.\r\n\r\n=602. Order Filicales.=—This order includes the typical ferns.\r\nEight families are recognized.\r\n\r\n_Family Osmundaceæ._—Three genera are known in this family. Osmunda\r\nhas a number of species, three of which are found in the Eastern United\r\nStates; the cinnamon-fern (O. cinnamomea), the royal fern (O. regalis),\r\nand Clayton’s fern (O. claytoniana). No species of this family are\r\nfound on the Pacific coast.\r\n\r\n_Family Gleicheniaceæ._—These ferns are found chiefly in the tropics,\r\nand in the mountain regions of the temperate zones of South America.\r\nThere are two genera, Gleichenia containing all but one of the known\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n_Family Matoniaceæ._—One genus, Matonia, in the Malayan region.\r\n\r\n_Family Schizæceæ._—These are chiefly tropical, but two species are\r\nfound in eastern North America, Schizæa pusilla and Lygodium palmatum,\r\nthe latter a climbing fern.\r\n\r\n_Family Hymenophyllaceæ._—These are known as the filmy ferns because\r\nof their thin, delicate leaves. They grow only in damp or wet regions,\r\nmostly in the tropics, but a few species occur in the southern United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n_Family Cyatheaceæ._—These are known as the tree ferns, because of the\r\nlarge size which many of them attain. They occur chiefly in tropical\r\nmountainous regions, many of them palm-like and imposing because of the\r\nlarge trunks and leaves. Dicksonia, Cyathea, Cibotium, Alsophila, are\r\nsome of the most conspicuous genera.\r\n\r\n_Family Parkeriaceæ._—There is a single species in this family\r\n(Ceratopteris thalictroides), abundant in the tropics and extending\r\ninto Florida. It is aquatic.\r\n\r\n_Family Polypodiaceæ._—This family includes the larger number of\r\nliving ferns and many genera and species are found in North America.\r\nExamples, Polypodium, Pteridium (= Pteris), Adiantum, etc.\r\n\r\n=603. Order Hydropterales (or Salviniales).=—The members of this\r\norder are peculiar, aquatic ferns, some floating on the water (Azolla,\r\nSalvinia), while others are anchored to the soil by roots (Marsilia,\r\nPilularia). They are known as water ferns. The sporangia are of two\r\nkinds, one containing large spores (macrospores) and the other small\r\nspores (microspores). They are therefore heterosporous ferns.\r\n\r\n_Family Salviniaceæ._—There are two genera, Salvinia and Azolla.\r\n\r\n_Family Marsiliaceæ._—Two genera, Marsilia and Pilularia. In this\r\nfamily the sporangia are enclosed in a sporocarp, which forms a\r\npod-like structure.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS EQUISETINEÆ.[35]\r\n\r\n=604. Order Equisetales.=—The single order contains a single\r\nfamily, Equisetaceæ, among the living forms, and but a single genus,\r\nEquisetum. There are about twenty-four species, with fourteen in the\r\nUnited States (see Chapter XXIX).\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS LYCOPODIINEÆ.[36]\r\n\r\n=605. Order Lycopodiales.=—The first two families of this order\r\ninclude the homosporous Lycopodiineæ, while the Selaginellaceæ are\r\nheterosporous.\r\n\r\n_Family Lycopodiaceæ._—There are two genera. Lycopodium (club moss)\r\nincludes many species, most of them tropical, but a number in temperate\r\nand subarctic regions. The gametophyte of many species is tuberous,\r\nlacks chlorophyll, and in some there lives an endophytic fungus.\r\nPhylloglossum with one species is found in Australia.\r\n\r\n_Family Psilotaceæ._—There are two genera. Psilotum chiefly in the\r\ntropics has one species (P. triquetrum) in the region of Florida.\r\n\r\n_Family Selaginellaceæ._—These include the little club mosses, with\r\none genus, Selaginella (see Chapter XXX).\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS ISOETINEÆ.\r\n\r\n=606. Order Isoetales=, with one family Isoetaceæ and one genus\r\nIsoetes (see Chapter XXXI). There are about fifty species, with about\r\nsixteen in the United States.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[34] As class Filicales in Engler and Prantl.\r\n\r\n[35] As class Equisetales in Engler and Prantl.\r\n\r\n[36] As class Lycopodiales in Engler and Prantl.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\nGYMNOSPERMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe white pine.\r\n\r\n=607. General aspect of the white pine.=—The white pine (Pinus\r\nstrobus) is found in the Eastern United States. In favorable situations\r\nin the forest it reaches a height of about 50 meters (about 160 feet),\r\nand the trunk a diameter of over 1 meter. In well-formed trees the\r\ntrunk is straight and towering; the branches where the sunlight has\r\naccess and the trees are not crowded, or are young, reaching out in\r\ngraceful arms, form a pyramidal outline to the tree. In old and dense\r\nforests the lower branches, because of lack of sunlight, have died\r\naway, leaving tall, bare trunks for a considerable height.\r\n\r\n=608. The long shoots of the pine.=—The branches are of two\r\nkinds. Those which we readily recognize are the long branches, so\r\ncalled because the growth in length each year is considerable. The\r\nterminal bud of the long branches, as well as of the main stem,\r\ncontinues each year the growth of the main branch or shoot; while the\r\nlateral long branches arise each year from buds which are crowded close\r\ntogether around the base of the terminal bud. The lateral long branches\r\nof each year thus appear to be in a whorl. The distance between each\r\nfalse whorl of branches, then, represents one year’s growth in length\r\nof the main stem or long branch.\r\n\r\n=609. The dwarf shoots of the pine.=—The dwarf branches are all\r\nlateral on the long branches, or shoots. They are scattered over the\r\nyear’s growth, and each bears a cluster of five long, needle-shaped,\r\ngreen leaves, which remain on the tree for several years. At the base\r\nof the green leaves are a number of chaff-like scales, the previous bud\r\nscales. While the dwarf branches thus bear green leaves, and scales,\r\nthe long branches bear only thin scale-like leaves which are not green.\r\n\r\n=610. Spore-bearing leaves of the pine.=—The two kinds of\r\nspore-bearing leaves of the pine, and their close relatives, are so\r\ndifferent from anything which we have yet studied, and are so unlike\r\nthe green leaves of the pine, that we would scarcely recognize them as\r\nbelonging to this category. Indeed there is great uncertainty regarding\r\ntheir origin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 339. Spray of white pine showing cluster of male\r\ncones just before the scattering of the pollen.]\r\n\r\n=611. Male cones, or male flowers.=—The male cones are borne in\r\nclusters as shown in fig. 339. Each compact, nearly cylindrical, or\r\nconical mass is termed a cone, or flower, and each arises in place of a\r\nlong lateral branch. One of these cones is shown considerably enlarged\r\nin fig. 340. The central axis of each cone is a lateral branch, and\r\nbelongs to the stem series. The stem axis of the cone can be seen\r\nin fig. 341. It is completely covered by stout, thick, scale-like\r\noutgrowths. These scales are obovate in outline, and at the inner\r\nangle of the upper end there are several rough, short spines. They\r\nare attached by their inner lower angle, which forms a short stalk\r\nor petiole, and continues through the inner face of the scale as\r\na “midrib.” What corresponds to the lamina of the scale-like leaf\r\nbulges out on each side below and makes the bulk of the scale. These\r\nprominences on the under side are the sporangia (microsporangia). There\r\nare thus two sporangia on a sporophyll (microsporophyll). When the\r\nspores (microspores), which here are usually called pollen grains, are\r\nmature, each sporangium, or anther locule, splits down the middle as\r\nshown in fig. 342, and the spores are set free.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 340. Staminate cone of white pine, with bud scales\r\nremoved on one side.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 341. Section of staminate cone, showing sporangia.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 342. Two sporophylls removed, showing opening of\r\nsporangia.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 343. Pollen grain of white pine.]\r\n\r\n=612. Microspores of the pine, or pollen grains.=—A mature pollen\r\ngrain of the pine is shown in fig. 343. It is a queer-looking object,\r\npossessing on two sides an air sac, formed by the upheaval of the outer\r\ncoat of the spore at these two points. When the pollen is mature, the\r\nmoisture dries out of the scale (or stamen, as it is often called here)\r\nwhile it ripens. When a limb, bearing a cluster of male cones, is\r\njarred by the hand, or by currents of air, the split suddenly opens,\r\nand a cloud of pollen bursts out from the numerous anther locules. The\r\npollen is thus borne on the wind and some of it falls on the female\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 344. White pine, branch with cluster of mature\r\ncones shedding the seed. A few young cones four months old are shown on\r\nbranch at the left. Drawn from photograph.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 345. Mature cone of white pine at time of\r\nscattering of the seed, nearly natural size.]\r\n\r\n=613. Form of the mature female cone.=—A cluster of the\r\nwhite pine cones is shown in fig. 344. These are mature, and the scales\r\nhave spread as they do when mature and becoming dry, in order that the\r\nseeds may be set at liberty. The general outline of the cone is\r\nlanceolate, or long oval, and somewhat curved. It measures about\r\n10-15_cm_ long. If we remove one of the scales, just as they are\r\nbeginning to spread, or before the seeds have scattered, we shall find\r\nthe seeds attached to the upper surface at the lower end. There are\r\ntwo seeds on each scale, one at each lower angle. They are ovate in\r\noutline, and shaped somewhat like a biconvex lens. At this time the\r\nseeds easily fall away, and may be freed by jarring the cone. As the\r\nseed is detached from the scale a strip of tissue from the latter is\r\npeeled off. This forms a “wing” for the seed. It is attached to one end\r\nand is shaped something like a knife blade. On the back of the scale is\r\na small appendage known as the cover scale.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 346. Sterile scale. Seeds undeveloped.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 347. Scale with well-developed seeds.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 348. Seeds have split off from scale.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 349. Back of scale with small cover scale.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 350. Winged seed free from scale.\r\n\r\nFigs. 346-350.—White pine showing details of mature scales and seed.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 351. Female cones of the pine at time of\r\npollination, about natural size.]\r\n\r\n=614. Formation of the female pine cone.=—The female flowers\r\nbegin their development rather late in the spring of the year. They\r\nare formed from terminal buds of the higher branches of the tree. In\r\nthis way the cone may terminate the main shoot of a branch, or of the\r\nlateral shoots in a whorl. After growth has proceeded for some time in\r\nthe spring, the terminal portion begins to assume the appearance of a\r\nyoung female cone or flower. These young female cones, at about the\r\ntime that the pollen is escaping from the anthers, are long ovate,\r\nmeasuring about 6-10 _mm_ long. They stand upright as shown in fig. 351.\r\n\r\n=615. Form of a “scale” of the female flower.=—If we remove one\r\nof the scales from the cone at this stage we can better study it in\r\ndetail. It is flattened, and oval in outline, with a stout “rib,” if\r\nit may be so called, running through the middle line and terminating\r\nin a point. The scale is in two parts as shown in fig. 354, which is\r\na view of the under side. The small “outgrowth” which appears as an\r\nappendage is the cover scale, for while it is smaller in the pine than\r\nthe other portion, in some of the relatives of the pine it is larger\r\nthan its mate, and being on the outside, covers it. (The inner scale is\r\nsometimes called the ovuliferous scale, because it bears the ovules.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 352. Section of female cone of white pine, showing\r\nyoung ovules (macrosporangia) at base of the ovuliferous scales.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 353. Scale of white pine with the two ovules at\r\nbase of ovuliferous scale.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 354. Scale of white pine seen from the outside,\r\nshowing the cover scale.]\r\n\r\n=616. Ovules, or macrosporangia, of the pine.=—At each of the\r\nlower angles of the scale is a curious oval body with two curved,\r\nforceps-like processes at the lower and smaller end. These are the\r\nmacrosporangia, or, as they are called in the higher plants, the\r\novules. These ovules, as we see, are in the positions of the seeds on\r\nthe mature cones. In fact the wall of the ovule forms the outer coat of\r\nthe seed, as we will later see.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 355. Branch of white pine showing young female\r\ncones at time of pollination on the ends of the branches, and\r\none-year-old cones below, near the time of fertilization.]\r\n\r\n=617. Pollination.=—At the time when the pollen is mature the\r\nfemale cones are still erect on the branches, and the scales, which\r\nduring the earlier stages of growth were closely pressed against one\r\nanother around the axis, are now spread apart. As the clouds of pollen\r\nburst from the clusters of the male cones, some of it is wafted by\r\nthe wind to the female cones. It is here caught in the open scales,\r\nand rolls down to their bases, where some of it falls between these\r\nforceps-like processes at the lower end of the ovule. At this time the\r\novule has exuded a drop of a sticky fluid in this depression between\r\nthe curved processes at its lower end. The pollen sticks to this, and\r\nlater, as this viscid substance dries up, it pulls the pollen close up\r\nin the depression against the lower end of the ovule. This depression\r\nis thus known as the _pollen chamber_.\r\n\r\n=618.= Now the open scales on the young female cone close up\r\nagain so tightly that water from rains is excluded. What is also very\r\ncurious, the cones, which up to this time have been standing erect, so\r\nthat the open scale could catch the pollen, now turn so that they hang\r\ndownward. This more certainly excludes the rains, since the overlapping\r\nof the scales forms a shingled surface. Quantities of resin are also\r\nformed in the scales, which exudes and makes the cone practically\r\nimpervious to water.\r\n\r\n=619.= The female cone now slowly grows during the summer and\r\nautumn, increasing but little in size during this time. During the\r\nwinter it rests, that is, ceases to grow. With the coming of spring,\r\ngrowth commences again and at an accelerated rate. The increase in size\r\nis more rapid. The cone reaches maturity in September. We thus see that\r\nnearly eighteen months elapse from the beginning of the female flower\r\nto the maturity of the cone, and about fifteen months from the time\r\nthat pollination takes place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 356.\r\n\r\nMacrosporangium of pine (ovule). _int_, integument; _n_, nucellus; _m_,\r\nmacrospore; _pc_, pollen chamber; _pg_, pollen grain; _an_, axile row;\r\n_spt_, spongy tissue. (After Ferguson.)]\r\n\r\n=620. Female prothallium of the pine.=—To study this we must\r\nmake careful longitudinal sections through the ovule (better made with\r\nthe aid of a microtome). Such a section is shown in fig. 358. The\r\nouter layer of tissue, which at the upper end (point where the scale\r\nis attached to the axis of the cone) stands free, is the ovular coat,\r\nor _integument_. Within this integument, near the upper end, there is\r\na cone-shaped mass of tissue. This mass of tissue is the _nucellus_,\r\nor the _macrosporangium_ proper. In the lower part of the nucellus in\r\nfig. 356 can be seen a rounded mass of “spongy tissue” (_spt_), which\r\nis a special nourishing tissue of the nucellus, or sporangium, around\r\nthe macrospore. Within this can be seen an axile row of three cells\r\n(_an: m_). The lowest one, which is larger than the other two, is the\r\n_macrospore_. Sometimes there are four of these cells in the axile row.\r\nThis axile row of three or four cells is formed by the two successive\r\ndivisions of a mother cell in the nucellus. So it would appear that\r\nthese three or four cells are all spores.\r\n\r\nOnly one of them, however, the lower one, develops; the others are\r\ndisorganized and disappear. The nucleus of the macrospore now divides\r\nseveral times to form several free nuclei in the now enlarging cavity,\r\nmuch as the nucleus of the macrospore in Selaginella and Isoetes\r\ndivides within the spore. The development thus far takes place during\r\nthe first summer, and now with the approach of winter the very young\r\nfemale prothallium goes into rest about the stage shown in fig. 358.\r\nThe conical portion of the nucellus which lies above is the nucellar\r\ncap.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 357.\r\n\r\nPollen grains of pine. One of them germinating. _p_¹ and _p_², the two\r\ndisintegrated prothallial cells, = sterile part of male gametophyte;\r\n_a.c._, central cell of antheridium; _v.n._, vegetative nucleus or tube\r\nnucleus of the single-wall cell of antheridium; _s.g._, starch grains.\r\n(After Ferguson.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 358.\r\n\r\nSection of ovule of white pine. _int_, integument; _pc_, pollen\r\nchamber; _pt_, pollen tube; _n_, nucleus; _m_, macrospore cavity.]\r\n\r\n=621. Male prothallia.=—By the time the pollen is mature the\r\nmale prothallium is already partly formed. In fig. 343 we can see two\r\nwell-formed cells. Two other cells are formed earlier, but they become\r\nso flattened that it is difficult to make them out when the pollen\r\ngrain is mature. These are shown in fig. 357, _p_¹ and _p_², and they\r\nare the only sterile cells of the male prothallium in the pines. The\r\nlarge cell is the antheridium wall, its nucleus _v.n._ in fig. 357. The\r\nsmaller cell, _a.c._, is the central cell of the antheridium. During\r\nthe summer and autumn the male prothallium makes some farther growth,\r\nbut this is slow. The larger cell, called the vegetative cell or tube\r\ncell, which is in reality the wall of the antheridium, elongates by\r\nthe formation of a tube, forming a sac, known as the pollen tube. It\r\nis either simple or branched. It grows down into the tissue of the\r\nnucellus, and at a stage represented in fig. 358, winter overtakes it\r\nand it rests. At this time the central cell has divided into two cells,\r\nand the vegetative nucleus is in the pollen tube.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 359.\r\n\r\nSection of nucellus and endosperm of white pine. The inner layer\r\nof cells of the integument shown just outside of nucellus; _arch_,\r\narchegonium; _en_, egg nucleus. In the nucellar cap are shown three\r\npollen tubes. _vn_, vegetative nucleus or tube nucleus; _stc_, stalk\r\ncell; _spn_, sperm nuclei, the larger one in advance is the one which\r\nunites with the egg nucleus. The archegonia are in the endosperm or\r\nfemale gametophyte. (After Ferguson.)]\r\n\r\n=622. The endosperm.=—In the following spring growth of all these\r\nparts continues. The nuclei in the macrospore divide to form more, and\r\neventually cell walls are formed between them making a distinct tissue,\r\nknown as the _endosperm_. This endosperm continues to grow until a\r\nlarge part of the nucellus is consumed for food.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 360.\r\n\r\nLast division of the egg in the white pine cutting off the ventral\r\ncanal cell at the apex of the archegonium. _End_, endosperm; _Arch_,\r\narchegonium.]\r\n\r\n=623. Female prothallium and archegonia.=—The endosperm is the\r\nfemale prothallium. This is very evident from the fact that several\r\narchegonia are developed in it usually on the side toward the pollen\r\nchamber. The archegonia are sexual organs, and since the sexual organs\r\nare developed on the gametophyte, therefore, the endosperm is the\r\nfemale gametophyte, or prothallium. In fig. 359 are represented two\r\narchegonia in the endosperm and the pollen tubes are growing down\r\nthrough the nucellus. The archegonia are quite large, the wall is a\r\nsheath or jacket of cells which encloses the very large egg which has a\r\nlarge nucleus in the center.\r\n\r\n=624. Pollen tube and sperm cells.=—While the endosperm (female\r\nprothallium) and archegonia are developing the pollen tube continues\r\nits growth down through the nucellar cap, as shown in fig. 359. At\r\nthe same time the two cells which were formed in the pollen grain\r\n(antheridium) from the central cell move down into the tube. One of\r\nthese is the “generative” cell, or “body” cell, and the other is called\r\nthe stalk cell, though it is more properly a sterile half of the\r\ncentral cell. The nucleus of the generative cell, about the time the\r\narchegonium is mature, divides to form two nuclei, which are the sperm\r\nnuclei, and the one in advance is the larger, though it is much smaller\r\nthan the egg nucleus.\r\n\r\n=625. Fertilization.=—Very soon after the archegonia are mature\r\n(early in June in the northern United States) the pollen tube grows\r\nthrough into the archegonium and empties the two sperm nuclei, the\r\nvegetative nucleus and the stalk cell, into the protoplasm of the large\r\negg. The larger of the two sperm nuclei at once comes in contact with\r\nthe very large egg nucleus and sinks down into a depression of the\r\nsame, as shown in fig. 361. These two nuclei, in the pines, do not fuse\r\ninto a resting nucleus, but at once organize the nuclear figure for the\r\nfirst division of the embryo. Two nuclei are thus formed, and these\r\ndivide to form four nuclei which sink to the bottom of the archegonium\r\nand there organize the embryo which pushes its way into the endosperm\r\nfrom which it derives its food (fig. 362).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 361.\r\n\r\nArchegonium of white pine at stage of fertilization, _en_, egg nucleus;\r\n_spn_, sperm nucleus in conjugation with it; _nb_, nutritive bodies in\r\ncytoplasm of large egg; _cpt_, cavity of pollen tube; _vn_, vegetative\r\nnucleus or tube nucleus; _stc_, stalk cell; _spn_, second sperm\r\nnucleus: _pr_, portion of prothallium or endosperm; _sg_, starch grains\r\nin pollen tube. The sheath of jacket cells of the archegonium is not\r\nshown. (After Ferguson.)]\r\n\r\n=626. Homology of the parts of the female cone.=—Opinions are\r\ndivided as to the homology of the parts of the female cone of the pine.\r\nSome consider the entire cone to be homologous with a flower of the\r\nangiosperms. The entire scale according to this view is a carpel, or\r\nsporophyll, which is divided into the cover scale and the ovuliferous\r\nscale. This division of the sporophyll is considered similar to that\r\nwhich we have in isoetes, where the sporophyll has a ligule above the\r\nsporangium, or as in ophioglossum, where the leaf is divided into a\r\nfertile and a sterile portion.\r\n\r\nOthers believe that the ovuliferous scale is composed of two leaves\r\nsituated laterally and consolidated representing a shoot in the axis of\r\nthe bract. There is some support for this in the fact that in certain\r\nabnormal cones which show proliferation a short axis appears in the\r\naxil of the bract and bears lateral leaves, and in some cases all\r\ngradations are present between these lateral leaves on the axis and\r\ntheir consolidation into an ovuliferous scale. In the normal condition\r\nof the ovuliferous scale the axis has disappeared and the shoot is\r\nrepresented only by the consolidated leaves, which would represent then\r\nthe macrosporophylls (or carpels) each bearing one macrosporangium\r\n(ovule).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 362.\r\n\r\nPine seed, section of, _sc_, seed coat; _n_, remains of nucellus;\r\n_end_, endosperm (= female gametophyte); _emb_, embryo = young\r\nsporophyte.

Pine seedling just emerging from the ground.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting and plausible views is that of Celakovsky.\r\nHe believes that the axial shoot is reduced to two ovules, that the\r\novules have two integuments, but the outer integument of each has\r\nbecome proliferated into scales which are consolidated. In this\r\nproliferation of the outer integument it is thrown off from the ovule\r\nso that it only remains attached to one side and the larger part of the\r\novule is thus left with only one integument. This view is supported\r\nby the fact that in gingko, for example (another gymnosperm), the\r\nouter integument (the “collar”) sometimes proliferates into a leaf.\r\nCelakovsky’s view is, therefore, not very different from the second one\r\nmentioned above.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 365.

Macrosporophyll of Cycas revoluta.]\r\n\r\n=627.= In such gymnosperms as cycas, illustrated in the\r\nfrontispiece, there is a close resemblance to the members of the fern\r\ngroup, especially the ferns themselves. This is at once suggested by\r\nthe form of the leaves. The stem is short and thick. The leaves have a\r\nstout midrib and numerous narrow pinnæ. In the center of this rosette\r\nof leaves are numerous smaller leaves, closely overlapping like bud\r\nscales. If we remove one of these at the time the fruit is forming we\r\nsee that in general it conforms to the plan of the large leaves. There\r\nare a midrib and a number of narrow pinnæ near the free end, the entire\r\nleaf being covered with woolly hairs. But at the lower end, in place of\r\nthe pinnæ, we see oval bodies. These are the macrosporangia (ovules)\r\nof cycas, and correspond to the macrosporangia of selaginella, and the\r\nleaf is the macrosporophyll.\r\n\r\n=628. Female prothallium of cycas.=—In figs. 367, 368, are\r\nshown mature ovules, or macrosporangia, of cycas. In 368, which is a\r\nroentgen-ray photograph of 367, the oval prothallium can be seen. So in\r\ncycas, as in selaginella, the female prothallium is developed entirely\r\ninside of the macrosporangium, and derives the nutriment for its growth\r\nfrom the cycas plant, which is the sporophyte. Archegonia are developed\r\nin this internal mass of cells. This aids us in determining that it is\r\nthe prothallium. In cycas it is also called endosperm, just as in the\r\npines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 367. Macrosporangium of Cycas revoluta.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 368. Roentgen photograph of same, showing female\r\nprothallium.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 369. A sporophyll (stamen) of cycas; sporangia in\r\ngroups on the under side. _b_, group of sporangia; _c_, open sporangia.\r\n(From Warming.)]\r\n\r\n=629.= If we cut open one of the mature ovules, we can see the\r\nendosperm (prothallium) as a whitish mass of tissue. Immediately\r\nsurrounding it at maturity is a thin, papery tissue, the remains of the\r\nnucellus (macrosporangium), and outside of this are the coats of the\r\novule, an outer fleshy one and an inner stony one.\r\n\r\n=630. Microspores, or pollen, of cycas.=—The cycas plant\r\nillustrated in the frontispiece is a female plant. Male plants also\r\nexist which have small leaves in the center that bear only\r\nmicrosporangia. These leaves, while they resemble the ordinary leaves,\r\nare smaller and correspond to the stamens. Upon the under side, as\r\nshown in fig. 369, the microsporangia are borne in groups of three\r\nor four, and these contain the microspores, or pollen grains. The\r\narrangement of these microsporangia on the under side of the cycas\r\nleaves bears a strong resemblance to the arrangement of the sporangia\r\non the under side of the leaves of some ferns.\r\n\r\n=631. The gingko tree= is another very interesting plant belonging\r\nto this same group. It is a relic of a genus which flourished in the\r\nremote past, and it is interesting also because of the resemblance of\r\nthe leaves to some of the ferns like adiantum, which suggests that\r\nthis form of the leaf in gingko has been inherited from some fern-like\r\nancestor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 370. Zamia integrifolia, showing thick stem,\r\nfern-like leaves, and cone of male flowers.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 371. Two spermatozoids in end of pollen tube of\r\ncycas. (After drawing by Hirase and Ikeno.)]\r\n\r\n=632.= While the resemblance of the leaves of some of the\r\ngymnosperms to those of the ferns suggests fern-like ancestors for the\r\nmembers of this group, there is stronger evidence of such ancestry\r\nin the fact that a prothallium can well be determined in the ovules.\r\nThe endosperm with its well-formed archegonia is to be considered a\r\nprothallium.\r\n\r\n=633. Spermatozoids in some gymnosperms.=—But within the past two\r\nyears it has been discovered in gingko, cycas, and zamia, all belonging\r\nto this group, that the sperm cells are well-formed spermatozoids. In\r\nzamia each one is shaped somewhat like the half of a biconvex lens, and\r\naround the convex surface are several coils of cilia. After the pollen\r\ntube has grown down through the nucellus, and has reached a depression\r\nat the end of the prothallium (endosperm) where the archegonia are\r\nformed, the spermatozoids are set free from the pollen tube, swim\r\naround in a liquid in this depression, and later fuse with the egg. In\r\ngingko and cycas these spermatozoids were first discovered by Ikeno and\r\nHirase in Japan, and later in zamia by Webber in this country. In figs.\r\n371-374 the details of the male prothallia and of fertilization are\r\nshown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 372. Fertilization in cycas, small spermatozoid\r\nfusing with the larger female nucleus of the egg. The egg protoplasm\r\nfills the archegonium. (From drawings by Hirase and Ikeno.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 373. Spermatozoid of gingko. Some abnormal forms\r\nhave a tail. (After Ikeno and Hirase.)]\r\n\r\n=634. The sporophyte in the gymnosperms.=—In the pollen grains\r\nof the gymnosperms we easily recognize the characters belonging to the\r\nspores in the ferns and their allies, as well as in the liverworts and\r\nmosses. They belong to the same series of organs, are borne on the\r\nsame phase or generation of the plant, and are practically formed in\r\nthe same general way, the variations between the different groups not\r\nbeing greater than those within a single group. These spores we have\r\nrecognized as being the product of the sporophyte. We are able then to\r\nidentify the sporophyte as that phase or generation of the plant formed\r\nfrom the fertilized egg and bearing ultimately the spores. We see from\r\nthis that the sporophyte in the gymnosperms is the prominent part of\r\nthe plant, just as we found it to be in the ferns. The pine tree, then,\r\nas well as the gingko, cycas, yew, hemlock-spruce, black spruce, the\r\ngiant redwood of California, etc., are sporophytes.\r\n\r\nWhile the sporangia (anther sacs) of the male flowers open and permit\r\nthe spores (pollen) to be scattered, the sporangia of the female\r\nflowers of the gymnosperms rarely open. The macrospore is developed\r\nwithin sporangium (nucellus) to form the female prothallium (endosperm).\r\n\r\n=635. The gametophyte has become dependent on the sporophyte.=—In\r\nthis respect the gymnosperms differ widely from the pteridophytes,\r\nthough we see suggestions of this condition of things in Isoetes and\r\nSelaginella, where the female prothallium is developed within the\r\nmacrospore, and even in Selaginella begins, and nearly completes, its\r\ndevelopment while still in the sporangium.\r\n\r\nIn comparing the female prothallium of the gymnosperms with that\r\nof the fern group we see a remarkable change has taken place. The\r\nfemale prothallium of the gymnosperms is very much reduced in size.\r\nEspecially, it no longer leads an independent existence from the\r\nsporophyte, as is the case with nearly all the fern group. It remains\r\nenclosed within the macrosporangium (in cycas if not fertilized it\r\nsometimes grows outside of the macrosporangium and becomes green), and\r\nderives its nourishment through it from the sporophyte, to which the\r\nlatter remains organically connected. This condition of the female\r\nprothallium of the gymnosperms necessitated a special adaptation of the\r\nmale prothallium in order that the sperm cells may reach and fertilize\r\nthe egg-cell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 374.\r\n\r\nGingko biloba. _A_, mature pollen grain; _B_, germinating pollen grain,\r\nthe branched tube entering among the cells of the nucellus; _Ex_,\r\nexine (outer wall of spore); _P_₁, prothallial cell; _P_₂, antheridial\r\ncell (divides later to form stalk cell and generative cell); _P_₃,\r\nvegetative cell; _Va_, vacuoles; _Nc_, nucellus.

(After drawing by Hirase and Ikeno.)]\r\n\r\n=636. Gymnosperms are naked seed plants.=—The pine, as we have\r\nseen, has naked seeds. That is, the seeds are not enclosed within the\r\ncarpel, but are exposed on the outer surface. All the plants of the\r\ngreat group to which the pine belongs have naked seeds. For this reason\r\nthe name “_gymnosperms_” has been given to this great group.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 376. Spermatozoids of zamia in pollen tube; _pg_,\r\npollen grain; _a_, _a_, spermatozoids. (After Webber.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 377. Spermatozoid of zamia showing spiral row of\r\ncilia. (After Webber.)]\r\n\r\n=637. Classification of gymnosperms.=—The gingko tree has until\r\nrecently been placed with the pines, yew, etc., in the order _Pinales_,\r\nbut the discovery of the spermatozoids in the pollen tube suggests\r\nthat it is not closely allied with the Pinales, and that it represents\r\nan order coordinate with them.

General appearance.=—As one of the plants to illustrate\r\nthis group we may take the wake-robin, as it is sometimes called,\r\nor trillium. There are several species of this genus in the United\r\nStates; the commonest one in the eastern part is the “white wake-robin”\r\n(Trillium grandiflorum). This occurs in or near the woods. A picture of\r\nthe plant is shown in fig. 378. There is a thick, fleshy, underground\r\nstem, or rhizome as it is usually called. This rhizome is perennial,\r\nand is marked by ridges and scars. The roots are quite stout and\r\npossess coarse wrinkles. From the growing end of the rhizome each year\r\nthe leafy, flowering stem arises. This is 20-30_cm_ (8-12 inches) in\r\nheight. Near the upper end is a whorl of three ovate leaves, and from\r\nthe center of this rosette rises the flower stalk, bearing the flower\r\nat its summit.\r\n\r\n=640. Parts of the flower. Calyx.=—Now if we examine the flower\r\nwe see that there are several leaf-like structures. These are arranged\r\nalso in threes just as are the leaves. First there is a whorl of three,\r\npointed, lanceolate, green, leaf-like members, which make up the\r\n_calyx_ in the higher plants, and the parts of the calyx are _sepals_,\r\nthat is, each leaf-like member is a _sepal_. But while the sepals are\r\npart of the flower, so called, we easily recognize them as belonging to\r\nthe _leaf series_.\r\n\r\n=641. Corolla.=—Next above the calyx is a whorl of white or\r\npinkish members, in Trillium grandiflorum, which are also leaf-like in\r\nform, and broader than the sepals, being usually somewhat broader at\r\nthe free end. These make up what is the _corolla_ in the higher plants,\r\nand each member of the corolla is a _petal_. But while they are parts\r\nof the flower, and are not green, their form and position would suggest\r\nthat they also belong to the leaf series.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 378. Trillium grandiflorum.]\r\n\r\n=642. Andrœcium.=—Within and above the insertion of the corolla\r\nis found another tier, or whorl, of members which do not at first\r\nsight resemble leaves in form. They are known in the higher plants\r\nas _stamens_. As seen in fig. 379 each stamen possesses a stalk (=\r\nfilament), and extending along on either side for the greater part of\r\nthe length are four ridges, two on each side. This part of the stamen\r\nis the _anther_, and the ridges form the anther sacs, or lobes. Soon\r\nafter the flower is opened, these anther sacs open also by a split in\r\nthe wall along the edge of the ridge. At this time we see quantities of\r\nyellowish powder or dust escaping from the ruptured anther locules. If\r\nwe place some of this under the microscope we see that it is made up of\r\nminute bodies which resemble spores; they are rounded in form, and the\r\nouter wall is spiny. They are in fact spores, the microspores of the\r\ntrillium, and here, as in the gymnosperms, are better known as _pollen_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 379. Sepal, petal, stamen, and pistil of Trillium\r\ngrandiflorum.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 380.\r\n\r\nTrillium grandiflorum, with the compound pistil expanded into three\r\nleaf-like members. At the right these three are shown in detail.]\r\n\r\n=643. The stamen a sporophyll.=—Since these pollen grains are\r\nthe spores, we would infer, from what we have learned of the ferns\r\nand gymnosperms, that this member of the flower which bears them is\r\na sporophyll; and this is the case. It is in fact what is called the\r\n_microsporophyll_. Then we see also that the anther sacs, since they\r\nenclose the spores, would be the sporangia (microsporangia). From this\r\nit is now quite clear that the stamens belong also to the leaf series.\r\nThey are just six in number, twice the number found in a whorl of\r\nleaves, or sepals, or corolla. It is believed, therefore, that there\r\nare two whorls of stamens in the flower of trillium.\r\n\r\n=644. Gynœcium.=—Next above the stamens and at the center of the\r\nflower is a stout, angular, ovate body which terminates in three long,\r\nslender, curved points. This is the pistil, and at present the only\r\nsuggestion which it gives of belonging to the leaf series is the fact\r\nthat the end is divided into three parts, the number of parts in each\r\nsuccessive whorl of members of the flower. If we cut across the body of\r\nthis pistil and examine it with a low power we see that there are three\r\nchambers or cavities, and at the junction of each the walls suggest to\r\nus that this body may have been formed by the infolding of the margins\r\nof three leaf-like members, the places of contact having then become\r\ngrown together. We see also that from the incurved margins of each\r\ndivision of the pistil there stand out in the cavity oval bodies. These\r\nare the _ovules_. Now the ovules we have learned from our study of the\r\ngymnosperms are the _sporangia_ (here the macrosporangia). It is now\r\nmore evident that this curious body, the pistil, is made up of three\r\nleaf-like members which have fused together, each member being the\r\nequivalent of a sporophyll (here the macrosporophyll). This must be a\r\nfascinating observation, that plants of such widely different groups\r\nand of such different grades of complexity should have members formed\r\non the same plan and belonging to the same series of members, devoted\r\nto similar functions, and yet carried out with such great modifications\r\nthat at first we do not see this common meeting ground which a\r\ncomparative study brings out so clearly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 381. Abnormal trillium. The nine parts of the\r\nperianth are green, and the outer whorls of stamens are expanded into\r\npetal-like members.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 382. Transformed stamen of trillium showing anther\r\nlocules on the margin.]\r\n\r\n=645. Transformations of the flower of trillium.=—If anything\r\nmore were needed to make it clear that the parts of the flower of\r\ntrillium belong to the leaf series we could obtain evidence from the\r\ntransformations which the flower of trillium sometimes presents. In\r\nfig. 381 is a sketch of a flower of trillium, made from a photograph.\r\nOne set of the stamens has expanded into petal-like organs, with the\r\nanther sacs on the margin. In fig. 380 is shown a plant of Trillium\r\ngrandiflorum in which the pistil has separated into three distinct and\r\nexpanded leaf-like structures, all green except portions of the margin.\r\n\r\n\r\nDentaria.\r\n\r\n=646. General appearance.=—For another study we may take a plant which\r\nbelongs to another division of the higher plants, the common “pepper\r\nroot,” or “toothwort” (Dentaria diphylla) as it is sometimes called.\r\nThis plant occurs in moist woods during the month of May, and is well\r\ndistributed in the northeastern United States. A plant is shown in fig.\r\n383. It has a creeping underground rhizome, whitish in color, fleshy,\r\nand with a few scales. Each spring the annual flower-bearing stem rises\r\nfrom one of the buds of the rhizome, and after the ripening of the\r\nseeds, dies down.\r\n\r\nThe leaves are situated a little above the middle point of the stem.\r\nThey are opposite and the number is two, each one being divided into\r\nthree dentate lobes, making what is called a compound leaf.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 383. Toothwort (Dentaria diphylla).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 384. Flower of the toothwort (Dentaria diphylla).]\r\n\r\n=647. Parts of the flower.=—The flowers are several, and they\r\nare borne on quite long stalks (pedicels) scattered over the terminal\r\nportion of the stem. We should now examine the parts of the flower\r\nbeginning with the calyx. This we can see, looking at the under side\r\nof some of the flowers, possesses four scale-like sepals, which easily\r\nfall away after the opening of the flower. They do not resemble leaves\r\nso much as the sepals of trillium, but they belong to the leaf series,\r\nand there are two pairs in the set of four. The corolla also possesses\r\nfour petals, which are more expanded than the sepals and are whitish in\r\ncolor. The stamens are six in number, one pair lower than the others,\r\nand also shorter. The filament is long in proportion to the anther, the\r\nlatter consisting of two lobes or sacs, instead of four as in trillium.\r\nThe pistil is composed of two carpels, or leaves fused together. So we\r\nfind in the case of the pepper root that the parts of the flower are\r\nin twos, or multiples of two. Thus they agree in this respect with the\r\nleaves; and while we do not see such a strong resemblance between the\r\nparts of the flower here and the leaves, yet from the presence of the\r\npollen (microspores) in the anther sacs (microsporangia) and of ovules\r\n(macrosporangia) on the margins of each half of the pistil, we are,\r\nfrom our previous studies, able to recognize here that all the members\r\nof the flower belong to the leaf series.\r\n\r\n=648.= In trillium and in the pepper root we have seen that the\r\nparts of the flower in each apparent whorl are either of the same\r\nnumber as the leaves in a whorl, or some multiple of that number. This\r\nis true of a large number of other plants, but it is not true of all. A\r\nglance at the spring-beauty (Claytonia virginiana), and at the anemone\r\n(or Isopyrum biternatum, fig. 563) will serve to show that the number\r\nof the different members of the flower may vary. The trillium and the\r\ndentaria were selected as being good examples to study first, to make\r\nit very clear that the members of the flower are fundamentally leaf\r\nstructures, or rather that they belong to the same series of members as\r\ndo the leaves of the plant.\r\n\r\n=649.

Male prothallium of angiosperms.=—The first division which\r\ntakes place in the nucleus of the pollen grain occurs, in the case of\r\ntrillium and many others of the angiosperms, before the pollen grain\r\nis mature. In the case of some specimens of T. grandiflorum in which\r\nthe pollen was formed during the month of October of the year before\r\nflowering, the division of the nucleus into two nuclei took place soon\r\nafter the formation of the four cells from the mother cell. The nucleus\r\ndivided in the young pollen grain is shown in fig. 385. After this\r\ntakes place the wall of the pollen grain becomes stouter, and minute\r\nspiny projections are formed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 385. Nearly mature pollen grain of trillium. The\r\nsmaller cell is the generative cell.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 386. Germinating spores (pollen grains) of\r\npeltandra; generative nucleus in one undivided, in other divided to\r\nform the two sperm nuclei; vegetative nucleus in each near the pollen\r\ngrain.]\r\n\r\n=651.= The larger cell is the vegetative cell of the prothallium,\r\nwhile the smaller one, since it later forms the sperm cells, is\r\nthe generative cell. This generative cell then corresponds to the\r\ncentral cell of the antheridium, and the vegetative cell perhaps\r\ncorresponds to a wall cell of the antheridium. If this is so, then the\r\nmale prothallium of angiosperms has become reduced to a very simple\r\nantheridium. The farther growth takes place after fertilization. In\r\nsome plants the generative cell divides into the two sperm cells at\r\nthe maturity of the pollen grain. In other cases the generative cell\r\ndivides in the pollen tube after the germination of the pollen grain.\r\nFor study of the pollen tube the pollen may be germinated in a weak\r\nsolution of sugar, or on the cut surface of pear fruit, the latter\r\nbeing kept in a moist chamber to prevent drying the surface.\r\n\r\n=652.= In the spring after flowering the pollen escapes from the\r\nanther sacs, and as a result of pollination is brought to rest on\r\nthe stigma of the pistil. Here it germinates, as we say, that is, it\r\ndevelops a long tube which makes its way down through the style, and in\r\nthrough the micropyle to the embryo sac, where, in accordance with what\r\ntakes place in other plants examined, one of the sperm cells unites\r\nwith the egg, and fertilization of the egg is the result.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 387. Section of pistil of trillium, showing\r\nposition of ovules (macrosporangia).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 388. Mandrake (Podophyllum peltatum).]\r\n\r\n=653. Macrospore and embryo sac.=—In trillium the three carpels\r\nare united into one, and in dentaria the two carpels are also united\r\ninto one compound pistil. Simple pistils are found in many plants, for\r\nexample in the ranunculaceæ, the buttercups, columbine, etc. These\r\nsimple pistils bear a greater resemblance to a leaf, the margins of\r\nwhich are folded around so that they meet and enclose the ovules or\r\nsporangia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 389. Young ovule (macrosporangium) of podophyllum.\r\n_n_, nucellus containing the one-celled stage of the macrospore;\r\n_i.int_, inner integument; _o.int_, outer integument.]\r\n\r\n=654.= If we cut across the compound pistil of trillium we find\r\nthat the infoldings of the three pistils meet to form three partial\r\npartitions which extend nearly to the center, dividing off three\r\nspaces. In these spaces are the ovules which are attached to the\r\ninfolded margins. If we make cross-sections of a pistil of the\r\nMay-apple (podophyllum) and through the ovules when they are quite\r\nyoung, we shall find that the ovule has a structure like that shown\r\nin fig. 389. At _m_ is a cell much larger than the surrounding ones.\r\nThis is called the macrospore. The tissue surrounding it is called\r\nhere the nucellus, but because it contains the macrospore it must be\r\nthe macrosporangium. The two coats or integuments of the ovule are\r\nyet short and have not grown out over the end of the nucellus. This\r\nmacrospore increases in size, forming first a cavity or sac in the\r\nnucellus, the _embryo sac_. The nucleus divides several times until\r\neight are formed, four in the micropylar end of the embryo sac and\r\nfour in the opposite end. In some plants it has been found that one\r\nnucleus from each group of four moves toward the middle of the embryo\r\nsac. Here they fuse together to form one nucleus, the _endosperm\r\nnucleus_ or _definitive nucleus_ shown in fig. 390. One of the nuclei\r\nat the micropylar end is the egg, while the two smaller ones nearer\r\nthe end are the _synergids_. The egg-cell is all that remains of the\r\narchegonium in this reduced prothallium. The three nuclei at the lower\r\nend are the _antipodal_ cells.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 390. Podophyllum peltatum, ovule containing mature\r\nembryo sac; two synergids, and eggs at left, endosperm nucleus in\r\ncenter, three antipodal cells at right.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 391. Macrospore (one-celled stage) of lilium.]\r\n\r\n=655. Embryo sac is the young female prothallium.=—In figs.\r\n391-393 are shown the different stages in the development of the\r\nembryo sac in lilium. The embryo sac at this stage is the young female\r\nprothallium, and the egg is the only remnant of the female sexual\r\norgan, the archegonium, in this reduced gametophyte.\r\n\r\n=656. Fertilization.=—When the pollen tube has reached the embryo\r\nsac (paragraph 652) it opens and the two sperm cells are emptied near\r\nthe egg. The first sperm nucleus enters the protoplasm surrounding the\r\negg nucleus and uniting with the latter brings about fertilization. The\r\nsecond sperm nucleus often unites with the endosperm nucleus (or with\r\none or both of the “polar nuclei”), bringing about what some call a\r\nsecond fertilization. Where this takes place in addition to the union\r\nof the first sperm nucleus with the egg nucleus it is called _double\r\nfertilization_. The sperm nucleus is usually smaller than the egg\r\nnucleus, but often grows to near or quite the size of the egg nucleus\r\nbefore union. See figs. 394 and 395.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 392. Two-and four-celled stage of embryo sac of\r\nlilium. The middle one shows division of nuclei to form the four-celled\r\nstage. (Easter lily.)]\r\n\r\n=657. Fertilization in plants is fundamentally the same as in\r\nanimals.=—In all the great groups of plants as represented by\r\nspirogyra, œdogonium, vaucheria, peronospora, ferns, gymnosperms, and\r\nin the angiosperms, fertilization, as we have seen, consists in the\r\nfusion of a male nucleus with a female nucleus. Fertilization, then, in\r\nplants is identical with that which takes place in animals.\r\n\r\n=658. Embryo.=—After fertilization the egg develops into a short\r\nrow of cells, the _suspensor_ of the embryo. At the free end the embryo\r\ndevelops. In figs. 397 and 398 is a young embryo of trillium.\r\n\r\n=659. Endosperm, the mature female prothallium.=—During the\r\ndevelopment of the embryo the endosperm nucleus divides into a great\r\nmany nuclei in a mass of protoplasm, and cell walls are formed\r\nseparating them into cells. This mass of cells is the _endosperm_,\r\nand it surrounds the embryo. It is the _mature female prothallium_,\r\nbelated in its growth in the angiosperms, usually developing only when\r\nfertilization takes place, and its use has been assured.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 393. Mature embryo sac (young prothallium) of\r\nlilium. _m_, micropylar end; _S_, synergids; _E_, egg; _Pn_, polar\r\nnuclei; _Ant_, antipodals. (Easter lily.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 394.

(Duggar.)]\r\n\r\n=660. Seed.=—As the embryo is developing it derives its\r\nnourishment from the endosperm (or in some cases perhaps from the\r\nnucellus). At the same time the integuments increase in extent and\r\nharden as the seed is formed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 395. Fertilization of cotton. _pt_, pollen tube;\r\n_Sn_, synergids; _E_, egg, with male and female nucleus fusing.\r\n(Duggar.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 396.\r\n\r\nDiagrammatic section of ovary and ovule at time of fertilization in\r\nangiosperm. _f_, funicle of ovule; _n_, nucellus; _m_, micropyle; _b_,\r\nantipodal cells of embryo sac; _e_, endosperm nucleus; _k_, egg-cell\r\nand synergids; _ai_, outer integument of ovule; _ii_, inner integument.\r\nThe track of the pollen tube is shown down through the style, walls of\r\nthe ovary to the micropylar end of the embryo sac.]\r\n\r\n=661. Perisperm.=—In most plants the nucellus is all consumed\r\nin the development of the endosperm, so that only minute fragments\r\nof disorganized cell walls remain next the inner integument. In some\r\nplants, however, (the water-lily family, the pepper family, etc.,)\r\na portion of the nucellus remains intact in the mature seed. In such\r\nseeds the remaining portion of the nucellus is the _perisperm_.\r\n\r\n=662. Presence or absence of endosperm in the seed.=—In many of\r\nthe angiosperms all of the endosperm is consumed by the embryo during\r\nits growth in the formation of the seed. This is the case in the rose\r\nfamily, crucifers, composites, willows, oaks, legumes, etc., as in the\r\nacorn, the bean, pea and others. In some, as in the bean, a large part\r\nof the nutrient substance passing from the endosperm into the embryo is\r\nstored in the cotyledons for use during germination. In other plants\r\nthe endosperm is not all consumed by the time the seed is mature.\r\nExamples of this kind are found in the buttercup family, the violet,\r\nlily, palm, jack-in-the-pulpit, etc. Here the remaining endosperm in\r\nthe seed is used as food by the embryo during germination.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 397. Section of one end of ovule of trillium,\r\nshowing young embryo in endosperm.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 398. Embryo enlarged.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 399. Seed of violet, external view, and section.\r\nThe section shows the embryo lying in the endosperm.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 400. Section of fruit of pepper (Piper nigrum),\r\nshowing small embryo lying in a small quantity of whitish endosperm\r\nat one end, the perisperm occupying the larger part of the interior,\r\nsurrounded by pericarp.]\r\n\r\n=663. Outer parts of the seed.=—While the embryo is forming within the\r\novule and the growth of the endosperm is taking place, where this is\r\nformed, other correlated changes occur in the outer parts of the ovule,\r\nand often in adjacent parts of the flower. These unite in making the\r\n“seed,” or the “fruit.” Especially in connection with the formation of\r\nthe seed a new growth of the outer coat, or integument, of the ovule\r\noccurs, forming the outer coat of the seed, known as the _testa_, while\r\nthe inner integument is absorbed. In some cases the inner integument\r\nof the ovule also forms a new growth, making an inner coat of the seed\r\n(rosaceæ). In still other cases neither of the integuments develops\r\ninto a testa, and the embryo sac lies in contact with the wall of\r\nthe ovary. Again an additional envelope grows up around the seed; an\r\nexample of this is found in the case of the red berries of the “yew”\r\n(taxus), the red outer coat being an extra growth, called an _aril_.\r\n\r\nIn the willow and the milkweed an aril is developed in the form of\r\na tuft of hairs. (In the willow it is an outgrowth of the funicle,\r\n= stalk of the ovule, and is called a funicular aril; while in the\r\nmilkweed it is an outgrowth of the micropyle, = the open end of the\r\novule, and is called a micropylar aril.)\r\n\r\n=664. Increase in size during seed formation.=—Accompanying this\r\nextra growth of the different parts of the ovule in the formation of\r\nthe seed is an increase in the size, so that the seed is often much\r\ngreater in size than the ovule at the time of fertilization. At the\r\nsame time parts of the ovary, and in many plants, the adherent parts of\r\nthe floral envelopes, as in the apple; or of the receptacle, as in the\r\nstrawberry; or in the involucre, as in the acorn; are also stimulated\r\nto additional growth, and assist in making the fruit.\r\n\r\n=665.

Parts of the ovule.=—In fig. 401 are represented three\r\ndifferent kinds of ovules, which depend on the position of the ovule\r\nwith reference to its stalk. The funicle is the stalk of the ovule,\r\nthe hilum is the point of attachment of the ovule with the ovary, the\r\nraphe is the part of the funicle in contact with the ovule in inverted\r\novules, the chalaza is the portion of the ovule where the nucellus and\r\nthe integuments merge at the base of the ovule, and the micropyle is\r\nthe opening at the apex of the ovule where the coats do not meet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 401.\r\n\r\n_A_, represents a straight (orthotropous) ovule of polygonum; _B_, the\r\ninverted (anatropous) ovule of the lily; and _C_, the right-angled\r\n(campylotropous) ovule of the bean. _f_, funicle; _c_, chalaza;\r\n_k_, nucellus; _ai_, outer integument; _ii_, inner integument; _m_,\r\nmicropyle; _em_, embryo sac.]\r\n\r\n\r\nComparison of Organ and Member.\r\n\r\n=667. The stamens and pistils are not the sexual organs.=—Before\r\nthe sexual organs and sexual processes in plants were properly\r\nunderstood it was customary for botanists to speak of the stamens and\r\npistils of flowering plants as the sexual organs. Some of the early\r\nbotanists, a century ago, found that in many plants the seed would not\r\nform unless first the pollen from the stamens came to be deposited on\r\nthe stigma of the pistil. A little further study showed that the pollen\r\ngerminated on the stigma and formed a tube which made its way down\r\nthrough the pistil and into the ovule.\r\n\r\nThis process, including the deposition of the pollen on the stigma,\r\nwas supposed to be fertilization, the stamen was looked on as the male\r\nsexual organ, and the pistil as the female sexual organ. We have found\r\nout, however, by further study, and especially by a comparison of the\r\nflowering plants and the lower plants, that the stamens and pistils are\r\nnot the sexual organs of the flower.\r\n\r\n=668. The stamens and pistils are spore-bearing leaves.=—The\r\nstamen is the spore-bearing leaf, and the pollen grains are not\r\nunlike spores; in fact they are the small spores of the angiosperms.\r\nThe pistil is also a spore-bearing leaf, the ovule the sporangium,\r\nwhich contains the large spore called an _embryo sac_. In the ferns\r\nwe know that the spore germinates and produces the green heart-shaped\r\nprothallium. The prothallium bears the sexual organs. Now the fern leaf\r\nbears the spores and the spore forms the prothallium. So it is in the\r\nflowering plants. The stamen bears the small spores—pollen grains—and\r\nthe pollen grain forms the prothallium. The prothallium in turn forms\r\nthe sexual organs. The process is in general the same as it is in the\r\nferns, but with this special difference: the prothallium and the sexual\r\norgan of the flowering plants are very much reduced.\r\n\r\n=669. Difference between organ and member.=—While it is not\r\nstrictly correct then to say that the stamen is a sexual organ, or male\r\norgan, we might regard it as a _male member_ of the flower, and we\r\nshould distinguish between _organ_ and _member_. It is an _organ_ when\r\nwe consider _pollen production_, but it is not a sexual organ. When we\r\nconsider _fertilization_ it is _not a sexual organ, but a male member_\r\nof the flower which bears the small spore.\r\n\r\nThe following table will serve to indicate these relations.\r\n\r\n    Stamen        = spore-bearing leaf = male member of flower.\r\n    Anther locule = sporangium.\r\n    Pollen grain  = small spore = reduced male prothallium and\r\n                      sexual organ.\r\n\r\nSo the pistil is not a sexual organ, but might be regarded as the\r\nfemale member of the flower.\r\n\r\n    Pistil     = spore-bearing leaf = female member of flower.\r\n    Ovule      = sporangium.\r\n    Embryo sac = large spore = female prothallium containing the egg.\r\n    The egg    = a reduced archegonium = the female sexual organ.\r\n\r\n\r\nProgression and Retrogression in Sporophyte and Gametophyte.\r\n\r\n=670. Sporophyte is prominent and highly developed.=—In the\r\nangiosperms then, as we have seen from the plants already studied, the\r\ntrillium, dentaria, etc., are sporophytes, that is they represent the\r\nspore-bearing, or sporophytic, stage. Just as we found in the case of\r\nthe gymnosperms and ferns, this stage is the prominent one, and the\r\none by which we characterize and recognize the plant. We see also that\r\nthe plants of this group are still more highly specialized and complex\r\nthan the gymnosperms, just as they were more specialized and complex\r\nthan the members of the fern group. From the very simple condition\r\nin which we possibly find the sporophyte in some of the algæ like\r\nspirogyra, vaucheria, and coleochæte, there has been a gradual increase\r\nin size, specialization of parts, and complexity of structure through\r\nthe bryophytes, pteridophytes, and gymnosperms, up to the highest types\r\nof plant structure found in the angiosperms. Not only do we find that\r\nthese changes have taken place, but we see that, from a condition of\r\ncomplete dependence of the spore-bearing stage on the sexual stage\r\n(gametophyte), as we find it in the liverworts and mosses, it first\r\nbecomes free from the gametophyte in the members of the fern group, and\r\nis here able to lead an independent existence. The sporophyte, then,\r\nmight be regarded as the modern phase of plant life, since it is that\r\nwhich has become and remains the prominent one in later times.\r\n\r\n=671. The gametophyte once prominent has become degenerate.=—On\r\nthe other hand we can see that just as remarkable changes have come\r\nupon the other phase of plant life, the sexual stage, or gametophyte.\r\nThere is reason to believe that the gametophyte was the stage of plant\r\nlife which in early times existed almost to the exclusion of the\r\nsporophyte, since the characteristic thallus of the algæ is better\r\nadapted to an aquatic life than is the spore-bearing state of plants.\r\nAt least, we now find in the plants of this group as well as in the\r\nliverworts, that the gametophyte is the prominent stage. When we reach\r\nthe members of the fern group, and the sporophyte becomes independent,\r\nwe find that the gametophyte is decreasing in size, in the higher\r\nmembers of the pteridophytes, the male prothallium consisting of only a\r\nfew cells, while the female prothallium completes its development still\r\nwithin the spore wall. And in selaginella it is entirely dependent on\r\nthe sporophyte for nourishment.\r\n\r\n=672.= As we pass through the gymnosperms we find that the\r\ncondition of things which existed in the bryophytes has been reversed,\r\nand the gametophyte is now entirely dependent on the sporophyte for\r\nits nourishment, the female prothallium not even becoming free from\r\nthe sporangium, which remains attached to the sporophyte, while the\r\nremnant of a male prothallium, during the stage of its growth, receives\r\nnourishment from the tissues of the nucellus through which it bores its\r\nway to the egg-cell.\r\n\r\n=673.= In the angiosperms this gradual degradation of the male\r\nand female prothallia has reached a climax in a one-celled male\r\nprothallium with two sperm cells, and in the embryo sac with no clearly\r\nrecognizable traces of an archegonium to identify it as a female\r\nprothallium. The development of the endosperm subsequent, in most\r\ncases, to fertilization, providing nourishment for the sporophytic\r\nembryo at one stage or another, is believed to be the last remnant of\r\nthe female prothallium in plants.\r\n\r\n=674. The seed.=—The seed is the only important character\r\npossessed by the higher plants (the gymnosperms and angiosperms) which\r\nis not possessed by one or another of the lower great groups. With the\r\ngradual evolution of the higher plants from the lower there has been\r\ndeveloped at certain periods organs or structural characters which\r\nwere not present in some of the lower groups. Thus the thallus is the\r\nplant body of the algæ and fungi, so that these two groups of plants\r\nare sometimes called _Thallophytes_. In the Bryophytes (liverworts and\r\nmosses) the thallus is still present, but there is added the highly\r\norganized archegonium in place of the simple female gamete or oogonium,\r\nor carpogonium of the algæ and fungi, and the sporophyte has become\r\na distinct though still dependent structure. In the Pteridophytes\r\nthe thallus is still present as the prothallium, archegoina are also\r\npresent, and while both of these structures are retrograding the\r\nsporophyte has become independent and has organized for the first time\r\na true vascular system for conduction of water and food. In the\r\ngymnosperms and angiosperms the thallus is present in the endosperm;\r\ndistinct, though reduced, archegonia are present in most gymnosperms\r\nand represented only by the egg in the angiosperms; the vascular system\r\nis still more highly developed while the seed for the first time is\r\norganized, and characterizes these plants so that they are called seed\r\nplants, or _Spermatophytes_.\r\n\r\n\r\nVariation, Hybridization, Mutation.\r\n\r\n=674a. Variation.=—It is a well-known fact that plants as well\r\nas animals are subject to variation. Under certain conditions, some\r\nof which are partly understood and others are unknown, the progeny of\r\nplants differ in one or more characters from their parents. Some of\r\nthese variations are believed to be due to the influence of environment\r\n(see Parts III and IV). Others are the result of the crossing of\r\nindividuals which show greater or lesser differences in one or more\r\ncharacters, or the crossing of different species (_hybridization_). The\r\nmost profound variations are those which spring suddenly into existence\r\n(_mutation_).\r\n\r\n=674b. Hybridization.=—Two different species are “crossed” where\r\nthe egg-cell of one species is fertilized by the sperm of another\r\nspecies. The progeny resulting from such a cross is a _hybrid_. Hybrids\r\nsometimes resemble one parent, sometimes another, sometimes both. Where\r\nthe parents differ only in respect to one character of an organ or\r\nstructure, there is a regular law in respect to the progeny if they are\r\nself-fertilized. In the first generation all the individuals are alike\r\nand resemble one of the parents, and the special differential character\r\nof that parent is called the _dominant_ character. In the second\r\ngeneration 75% possess the dominant character, while 25% resemble\r\nthe other original parent, and its differential character is called\r\n_recessive_. These are _pure_ recessives, since successive generations,\r\nif self-fertilized, are always recessive. Of the 75% which show the\r\ndominant character in the second generation, one-third (or 25% of the\r\nwhole number) are pure dominants if self-fertilization is continued,\r\nwhile 50% are really “cross breds” like the first generation, and\r\nif self-fertilized split up again into approximately 25 dominants,\r\n50 cross breds, and 25 recessives. This is what is called Mendel’s\r\nlaw. Where the original parents differ in respect to more than one\r\ncharacter, the result is more complicated (see Mendel’s Principles of\r\nHeredity; also de Vries, Das Spaltungsgesetz der Bastarde, Ber. d.\r\ndeutsch. bot. Gesell., 18, 83, 1900).\r\n\r\n=674c. Mutation.=—This term is applied to those variations which\r\nappear so suddenly that some of the progeny of two like individuals\r\ndiffer from all the others to a marked degree. Some of these mutations\r\nare so different as to be regarded as new species. Some of the\r\nprimroses show mutations, and Œnothera gigas is a mutation from Œnothera\r\nlamarkiana (see de Vries, Die Mutationstheorie, Leipzig).\r\n\r\n=675.= TABLE SHOWING HOMOLOGIES OF SPOROPHYTE AND GAMETOPHYTE IN\r\nANGIOSPERMS.\r\n\r\n    TERMS CORRESPONDING TO THOSE USED IN PTERIDOPHYTES.

These mother cells\r\nare formed as a last division of the fertile tissue (archesporium) of\r\nthe sporangium. In ordinary cell division the nucleus always divides\r\nprior to the division of the cell. In many cases it is directly\r\nconnected with the laying down of the dividing cell wall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 402. Forming spores in mother cells (Polypodium\r\nvulgare).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 403. Spores just mature and wall of mother cell\r\nbroken (Asplenium bulbiferum).]\r\n\r\n=677. Direct division of the nucleus.=—The nucleus divides in two\r\ndifferent ways. On the one hand the process is very simple. The nucleus\r\nsimply fragments, or cuts itself in two. This is direct division.\r\n\r\n=678. Indirect division of the nucleus.=—On the other hand very\r\ncomplicated phenomena precede and attend the division of the nucleus,\r\ngiving rise to a succession of nuclear figures presented by a definite\r\nbut variable series of evolutions on the part of the nuclear substance.\r\nThis is _indirect division_ of the nucleus, or _karyokinesis_. Indirect\r\ndivision of the nucleus is the usual method, and it occurs in the\r\nnormal growth and division of the cell. The nuclear figures which are\r\nformed in the division of the mother cell into the four spores are\r\nsomewhat different from those occurring in vegetative division, but\r\ntheir study will serve to show the general character of the process.\r\n\r\n=679. Chromatin and linin of the nucleus.=—In figure 404 is\r\nrepresented a pollen mother cell of the May-apple (podophyllum). The\r\nnucleus is in the resting stage. There is a network consisting of very\r\ndelicate threads, the _linin_ network. Upon this network are numerous\r\nsmall granules, and at the junction of the threads are distinct knots.\r\nThe nucleolus is quite large and prominent. The numerous small granules\r\nupon the linin stain very deeply when treated with certain dyes used in\r\ndifferentiating the nuclear structure. This deeply staining substance\r\nis the _chromatin_ of the nucleus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 404. Pollen mother cell of podophyllum, resting\r\nnucleus. Chromatin forming a network.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 405. Spirem stage of nucleus. _nu_, nuclear cavity;\r\n_n_, nucleolus; _Sp_, spirem.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 406. Forming spindle, threads from protoplasm with\r\nseveral poles, roping the chromosomes up to nuclear plate.\r\n\r\n(Figures 404-406 after Mottier.)]\r\n\r\n=680. The chromatin skein.=—One of the first nuclear figures in the\r\npreparatory stages of division is the chromatin _skein_ or _spirem_.\r\nThe chromatin substance unites to form this. The spirem is in the form\r\nof a narrow continuous ribbon, or band, woven into an irregular skein,\r\nor gnarl, as shown in figure 405. This band splits longitudinally\r\ninto two narrow ones, and then each divides into a definite number\r\nof segments, about eight in the case of podophyllum. Sometimes the\r\nlongitudinal splitting of the band appears to take place after the\r\nseparation into the chromatin segments. The segments remain in pairs\r\nuntil they separate at the nuclear plate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 407.\r\n\r\nKaryokinesis in pollen mother cells of podophyllum. At the left the\r\nspindle with the chromosomes separating at the nuclear plate; in the\r\nmiddle figure the chromosomes have reached the poles of the spindle,\r\nand at the right the chromosomes are forming the daughter nuclei.\r\n(After Mottier.)]\r\n\r\n=681. Chromosomes, nuclear plate, and nuclear spindle.=—Each\r\none of these rod-like chromatin segments is a _chromosome_.\r\nThe pairs of chromosomes arrange themselves in a median plane\r\nof the nucleus, radiating somewhat in a stellate fashion, forming\r\nthe _nuclear plate_, or _monaster_. At the same time threads of the\r\nprotoplasm (kinoplasm) become arranged in the form of a spindle,\r\nthe axis of which is perpendicular to the nuclear plate of chromosomes,\r\nas shown in figure 407, at left. Each pair of chromosomes\r\nnow separate in the line of the division of the original spirem,\r\none chromosome of each pair going to one pole of the spindle,\r\nwhile the other chromosome of each pair goes to the opposite pole.\r\nThe chromosomes here unite to form the daughter nuclei. Each of these\r\nnuclei now divide as shown in figure 409 (whether the chromosomes in\r\nthis second division in the mother cell split longitudinally or divide\r\ntransversely has not been definitely settled), and four nuclei are\r\nformed in the pollen mother cell. The protoplasm about each one of\r\nthese four nuclei now surrounds itself with a wall and the spores are\r\nformed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 408. Different stages in the separation of divided\r\nU-shaped chromosomes at the nuclear plate. (After Mottier.) In\r\npodophyllum.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 409. Second division of nuclei in pollen mother\r\ncell of podophyllum, chromosomes at poles.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 410. Chromosomes uniting at poles to form the\r\nnuclei of the four spores. (After Mottier.)]\r\n\r\n=The number of chromosomes usually the same in a given species\r\nthroughout one phase of the plant.=—In those plants which have been\r\ncarefully studied, the number of chromosomes in the dividing nucleus\r\nhas been found to be fairly constant in a given species, through all\r\nthe divisions in that stage or phase of the plant, especially in the\r\nembryonic, or young growing parts. For example, in the prothallium, or\r\ngametophyte, of certain ferns, as osmunda, the number of chromosomes\r\nin the dividing nucleus is always twelve. So in the development of the\r\npollen of lilium from the mother cells, and in the divisions of the\r\nantherid cell to form the generative cells or sperm cells, there are\r\nalways twelve chromosomes so far as has been found. In the development\r\nof the egg of lilium from the macrospore there are also twelve\r\nchromosomes.\r\n\r\n=When fertilization takes place the number of chromosomes is doubled\r\nin the embryo.=—In the spermatozoid of osmunda then, as well as in\r\nthe egg, since these are developed on the gametophyte, there are twelve\r\nchromosomes each. The same is true in the sperm cell (generative cell)\r\nof lilium, and also in the egg-cell. When these nuclei unite, as they\r\ndo in fertilization, the paternal nucleus with the maternal nucleus,\r\nthe number of chromosomes in the fertilized egg, if we take lilium as\r\nan example, is twenty-four instead of twelve; the number is doubled.\r\nThe fertilized egg is the beginning of the sporophyte, as we have seen.\r\nCuriously throughout all the divisions of the nucleus in the embryonic\r\ntissues of the sporophyte, so far as has been determined, up to the\r\nformation of the mother cells of the spores, the number of chromosomes\r\nis usually the same.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 411. Karyokinesis in sporophyte cells of\r\npodophyllum (twice the number of chromosomes here that are found in the\r\ndividing spore mother cells).]\r\n\r\n=682. Reduction of the number of chromosomes in the nucleus.=—If\r\nthere were no reduction in the number of chromosomes at any point in\r\nthe life cycle of plants, the number would thus become infinitely\r\nlarge. A reduction, however, does take place. This usually occurs,\r\neither in the mother cell of the spores or in the divisions of its\r\nnucleus, at the time the spores are formed. In the mother cells a sort\r\nof pseudo-reduction is effected by the chromatin band separating into\r\none half the usual number of nuclear segments. So that in lilium during\r\nthe first division of the nucleus of the mother cell the chromatin band\r\ndivides into twelve segments, instead of twenty-four as it has done\r\nthroughout the sporophyte stage. So in podophyllum during the first\r\ndivision in the mother cell it separates into eight instead of into\r\nsixteen. Whether a qualitative reduction by transverse division of the\r\nspirem band, unaccompanied by a longitudinal splitting, takes place\r\nduring the first or second karyokinesis is still in doubt. Qualitative\r\nreduction does take place in some plants according to Beliaieff and\r\nothers. Recently the author has found that it takes place in Trillium\r\ngrandiflorum during the second karyokinesis, and in Arisæma triphyllum\r\nthe chromosomes divide both transversely and longitudinally during\r\nthe first karyokinesis forming four chromosomes, and a qualitative\r\nreduction takes place here.\r\n\r\n=683. Significance of karyokinesis and reduction.=—The precision\r\nwith which the chromatin substance of the nucleus is divided, when\r\nin the spirem stage, and later the halves of the chromosomes are\r\ndistributed to the daughter nuclei, has led to the belief that this\r\nsubstance bears the hereditary qualities of the organism, and that\r\nthese qualities are thus transmitted with certainty to the offspring.\r\nIn reduction not only is the original number of chromosomes restored,\r\nit is believed by some that there is also a qualitative reduction of\r\nthe chromatin, i.e. that each of the four spores possesses different\r\nqualitative elements of the chromatin as a result of the reducing\r\ndivision of the nucleus during their formation.\r\n\r\nThe increase in number of chromosomes in the nucleus occurs with the\r\nbeginning of the sporophyte, and the numerical reduction occurs at the\r\nbeginning of the gametophyte stage. The full import of karyokinesis and\r\nreduction is perhaps not yet known, but there is little doubt that a\r\nprofound significance is to be attached to these interesting phenomena\r\nin plant life.\r\n\r\n=684. The gametophyte may develop directly from the tissue of the\r\nsporophyte.=—If portions of the sporophyte of certain of the\r\nmosses, as sections of a growing seta, or of the growing capsule, be\r\nplaced on a moist substratum, under favorable conditions some of the\r\nexternal cells will grow directly into protonemal threads. In some\r\nof the ferns, as in the sensitive fern (onoclea), when the fertile\r\nleaves are expanding into the sterile ones, protonemal outgrowths occur\r\namong the aborted sporangia on the leaves of the sporophyte. Similar\r\nrudimentary protonemal growths sometimes occur on the leaves of the\r\ncommon brake (pteris) among the sporangia, and some of the rudimentary\r\nsporangia become changed into the protonema. In some other ferns, as\r\nin asplenium (A. filix-fœmina, var. clarissima), prothallia are borne\r\namong the aborted sporangia, which bear antheridia and archegonia. In\r\nthese cases the gametophyte develops from the tissue of the sporophyte\r\nwithout the intervention or necessity of the spores. This is _apospory_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 412. Apogamy in Pteris cretica.]\r\n\r\n=685. The sporophyte may develop directly from the tissue of the\r\ngametophyte.=—In some of the ferns, Pteris cretica for example,\r\nthe embryo fern sporophyte arises directly from the tissue of the\r\nprothallium, without the intervention of sexual organs, and in some\r\ncases no sexual organs are developed on such prothallia. Sexual organs,\r\nthen, and the fusion of the spermatozoid and egg nucleus are not here\r\nnecessary for the development of the sporophyte. This is _apogamy_.\r\nApogamy occurs in some other species of ferns, and in other groups of\r\nplants as well, though it is in general a rare occurrence except in\r\ncertain species, where it may be the general rule.\r\n\r\n=686. Types of nuclear division.=—The nuclear figures in the\r\nvegetative cells are usually different from those in the spore\r\nmother cells. In the spore mother cells there are two types of\r\nnuclear division. (1) The first division in the mother cell is called\r\n_heterotypic_. The early stages of this division usually extend over a\r\nlonger period than the second, and the figures are more complex. Before\r\nthe chromosomes arrive at the nuclear plate they are often in the form\r\nof rings, or tetrads, or in the form of X, V, or Y, and the number is\r\nusually one half the number in the preceding cells of the sporophyte.\r\n(2) The _homotypic_ division immediately follows the heterotypic and\r\nthe figures are simpler, often the chromosomes being of a hook form,\r\nor sometimes much stouter than in the heterotypic division. In the\r\nvegetative cells (sometimes called somatic cells, or body cells in\r\ncontrast with reproductive cells) there is another type, called by some\r\nthe _vegetative type_. The chromosomes here are often in the form of\r\nthe letter U, and the figures are much simpler than in the heterotypic\r\ndivision. In the somatic cells of the sporophyte, as stated above,\r\nthe number of chromosomes is double that found in the heterotypic\r\nand homotypic divisions of the mother cells and in the somatic cells\r\nof the gametophyte, Fig. 411 represents a late stage in the division\r\nof somatic cells in the sporophyte of podophyllum. The root-tips of\r\nvarious plants as the onion, lily, etc., are excellent places in which\r\nto study nuclear division in the somatic cells of the sporophyte.\r\n\r\n=687. Comparison with animals.=—In animals there does not seem\r\nto be anything which corresponds with the gametophyte of plants unless\r\nthe sperm cells and eggs themselves represent it. Heterotypic and\r\nhomotypic division with the accompanying reduction of the number of the\r\nchromosomes takes place in animals usually in the mother cells of the\r\nsperms and eggs. At the time of fertilization the number of chromosomes\r\nis doubled, so that all the somatic cells (except in rare instances)\r\nfrom the fertilized egg to the mother cells of sperms and eggs have the\r\ndoubled number of chromosomes. Reduction, therefore, takes place in\r\nanimals just prior to the formation of the gametes, while in plants it\r\ntakes place just prior to the formation of the gametophytes.\r\n\r\n=688. Perhaps there is not a fundamental difference between\r\ngametophyte and sporophyte.=—This development of sporophyte, or\r\nleafy-stemmed plant of the fern (parag. 685), from the tissue of the\r\ngametophyte is taken by some to indicate that there is not such a great\r\ndifference between the gametophyte and sporophyte of plants as others\r\ncontend. In accordance with this view it has been suggested that the\r\nleafy-stemmed moss plant, as well as the leafy stem of the liverworts,\r\nis homologous with the sporophyte or leafy stem of the fern plant; that\r\nit arises by budding from the protonema; and that the sexual organs are\r\nborne then on the sporophyte.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III.\r\n\r\nPLANT MEMBERS IN RELATION TO ENVIRONMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE ORGANIZATION OF THE PLANT.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Organization of Plant Members.[37]\r\n\r\n=689.= It is now generally conceded that the earliest plants to\r\nappear in the world were very simple in form and structure. Perhaps the\r\nearliest were mere bits of naked protoplasm, not essentially different\r\nfrom early animal life. The simplest ones which are clearly recognized\r\nas plants are found among the lower algæ and fungi. These are single\r\ncells of very minute size, roundish, oval, or oblong, existing\r\nduring their growing period in water or in a very moist substratum\r\nor atmosphere. Examples are found in the red snow plant (_Sphærella\r\nnivalis_), the Pleurococcus, the bacteria; and among small colonies of\r\nthese simple organisms (Pandorina) or the thread-like forms (Spirogyra,\r\nŒdogonium, etc.). It is evident that some of the life relations of such\r\nvery simple organisms are very easily obtained—that is, the adjustment\r\nto environment is not difficult. All of the living substance is very\r\nclosely surrounded by food material in solution. These food solutions\r\nare easily absorbed. Because of the minute size of the protoplasts and\r\nof the plant body, they do not have to solve problems of transport of\r\nfood to distant parts of the body. When we pass to more bulky organisms\r\nconsisting of large numbers of protoplasts closely compacted together,\r\nthe problem of relation to environment and of food transport become\r\nfelt; the larger the organism usually the greater are these problems.\r\nA point is soon reached at which there is a gain by a differentiation\r\nin the work of different protoplasts, some for absorption, some for\r\nconduction, some for the light relation, some for reproduction, and\r\nso on. There is also a gain in splitting the form of the plant body\r\nup into parts so that a larger surface is exposed to environment\r\nwith an economy in the amount of building material required. In this\r\ndifferentiation of the plant body into parts, there are two general\r\nproblems to be solved, and the plant to be successful in its struggle\r\nfor existence must control its development in such a way as to preserve\r\nthe balance between them. (1) A ready display of a large surface to\r\nenvironment for the purpose of acquiring food and the disposition of\r\nwaste. (2) The protection of the plant from injuries incident to an\r\naustere environment.\r\n\r\nIt is evident with the great variety of conditions met with in\r\ndifferent parts of the same locality or region, and in different parts\r\nof the globe, that the plant has had very complex problems to meet and\r\nin the solution of them it has developed into a great variety of forms.\r\nIt is also likely that different plants would in many cases meet these\r\ndifficulties in different ways, sometimes with equal success, at other\r\ntimes with varied success. Just as different persons, given some one\r\npiece of work to do, are likely to employ different methods and reach\r\nresults that are varied as to their value. While we cannot attribute\r\nconsciousness or choice to plants in the sense in which we understand\r\nthese qualities in higher animals, still there is something in their\r\n“constitution” or “character” whereby they respond in a different\r\nmanner to the same influences of environment. This is, perhaps,\r\nimperceptible to us in the different individuals of the same species,\r\nbut it is more marked in different species. Because of our ignorance of\r\nthis occult power in the plant, we often speak of it as an “inherent”\r\nquality.\r\n\r\n      Perhaps the most striking examples one might use to\r\n    illustrate the different line of organization among\r\n    plants in two regions where the environment is very\r\n    different are to be found in the adaptation of the\r\n    cactus or the yucca to desert regions, and the oak or\r\n    the cucurbits to the land conditions of our climate.\r\n    The cactus with stem and leaf function combined in a\r\n    massive trunk, or the yucca with bulky leaves expose\r\n    little surface in comparison to the mass of substance,\r\n    to the dry air. They have tissue for water storage and\r\n    through their thick epidermis dole it out slowly since\r\n    there is but little water to obtain from dry soil.\r\n\r\n      The cucurbits and the oak in their foliage leaves\r\n    expose a very large surface in proportion to the mass\r\n    of their substance, to an atmosphere not so severely\r\n    dry as that of the desert, while the roots are able\r\n    to obtain an abundant supply of water from the moist\r\n    soil. The cactus and the yucca have differentiated\r\n    their parts in a very different way from the oak or the\r\n    cucurbits, in order to adapt themselves to the peculiar\r\n    conditions of the environment.\r\n\r\n      When we say that certain plants have the power to\r\n    adapt themselves to certain conditions of environment,\r\n    we do not mean to say that if the cucurbits were\r\n    transferred to the desert they would take on the form\r\n    of the cactus or the yucca. They could do neither.\r\n    They would perish, since the change would be too great\r\n    for their organization. Nor do we mean, that, if the\r\n    cactus or yucca were transferred from the desert to our\r\n    climate, they would change into forms with thin foliage\r\n    leaves. They could not. The fact is that they are\r\n    enabled to live in our climate when we give them some\r\n    care, but they show no signs of assuming characters\r\n    like those of our vegetation. What we do mean is, that\r\n    where the change is not too great nor too sudden, some\r\n    of the plants become slightly modified. This would\r\n    indicate that the process of organization and change of\r\n    form is a very slow one, and is therefore a question of\r\n    time—ages it may be—in which change in environment\r\n    and adaptation in form and structure have gone on\r\n    slowly hand in hand.\r\n\r\n=690. Members of the plant body.=—The different parts into which\r\nthe plant body has become differentiated are from one point of view,\r\nspoken of as members. It is evident that the simplest forms of life\r\nspoken of above do not have members. It is only when differentiation\r\nhas reached the stage in which certain more or less prominent parts\r\nperform certain functions for the plant that members are recognized.\r\nIn the algæ and fungi there is no differentiation into stem and leaf,\r\nthough there is an approach to it in some of the higher forms. Where\r\nthis simple plant body is flattened, as in the sea-wrack, or ulva, it\r\nis a _frond_. The Latin word for frond is _thallus_, and this name is\r\napplied to the plant body of all the lower plants, the algæ and fungi.\r\nThe algæ and fungi together are sometimes called _thallophytes_, or\r\n_thallus plants_. The word thallus is also sometimes applied to the\r\nflattened body of the liverworts. In the foliose liverworts and mosses\r\nthere is an axis with leaf-like expansions. These are believed by some\r\nto represent true stems and leaves; by others to represent a flattened\r\nthallus in which the margins are deeply and regularly divided, or in\r\nwhich the expansion has only taken place at regular intervals.\r\n\r\nIn the higher plants there is usually great differentiation of the\r\nplant body, though in many forms, as in the duckweeds, it is in the\r\nform of a frond. While there is a great variety in the form and\r\nfunction of the members of the plant body, they are all reducible to a\r\nfew fundamental members. Some reduce these forms to three, the _root_,\r\n_stem_, _leaf_; while others to two, the _root_, and _shoot_, which is\r\nperhaps the best primary subdivision, and the shoot is then divided\r\ninto stem and leaf, the leaf being a lateral outgrowth of the stem, and\r\ncan be indicated by the following diagram:\r\n\r\n\r\n                            {Stem.\r\n                  {Shoot····{\r\n    Plant body····{         {Leaf.\r\n                  {Root.\r\n\r\n\r\nKINDS OF SHOOTS.\r\n\r\n=691.= Since it is desirable to consider the shoot in its relation\r\nto environment, for convenience in discussion we may group shoots into\r\nfour prominent kinds: (1) _Foliage shoots_; (2) _Shoots without foliage\r\nleaves_; (3) _Floral shoots_; (4) _Winter conditions of shoots and\r\nbuds._ Topic (4) will be treated in Chapter XXXIX, section IV.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 413. Lupinus perennis. Foliage shoot and floral\r\nshoot.]\r\n\r\n=692. (1st) Foliage shoots.=—Foliage shoots are either aerial,\r\nwhen their relation is to both light and air; or they are aquatic,\r\nwhen their relation is to both light and water. They bear green\r\nleaves, and whether in the air or water we see that light is one of\r\nthe necessary relations for all. Naturally there are several ways in\r\nwhich a shoot may display its leaves to the light and air or water.\r\nBecause of the great variety of conditions on the face of the earth\r\nand the multitudinous kinds of plants, there is the greatest diversity\r\npresented in the method of meeting these conditions. There is to be\r\nconsidered the problem of support to the shoot in the air, or in the\r\nwater. The methods for solving this problem are fundamentally different\r\nin each case, because of the difference in the density of air and\r\nwater, the latter being able to buoy up the plant to a great degree,\r\nparticularly when the shoot is provided with air in its intercellular\r\nspaces or air cavities. In the solution of the problem in the relation\r\nof the shoot to aerial environment, stem and leaf have in most cases\r\ncoöperated;[38] but in view of the great variety of stems and their\r\nmodifications, as well as of leaves, it will be convenient to discuss\r\nthem in separate chapters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 413_a_. Burrowing type, the mandrake, a “rhizome.”]\r\n\r\n=693. (2d) Shoots without foliage leaves.=—These are subterranean\r\nor aerial. Nearly all subterranean shoots have also aerial shoots,\r\nthe latter being for the display of foliage leaves (foliage-shoots),\r\nand also for the display of flowers (flower-shoots). The subterranean\r\nkinds bear scale leaves, i.e., the leaves not having a light relation\r\nare reduced in size, being small, and they lack chlorophyll. Examples\r\nare found in Solomon’s seal, mandrake (fig. 413_a_), etc. Here the\r\nscale leaves are on the bud at the end of the underground stem from\r\nwhich the foliage shoot arises. Aerial shoots which lack foliage\r\nleaves are the dodder, Indian-pipe-plant, beech drops, etc. These\r\nplants are saprophytes or parasites (see Chapter IX). Deriving their\r\ncarbohydrate food from other living plants, or from humus, they do not\r\nneed green leaves. The leaves have, therefore, probably been reduced\r\nin size to mere scales, and accompanying this there has been a loss of\r\nthe chlorophyll. Other interesting examples of aerial shoots without\r\nfoliage leaves are the cacti where the stem has assumed the leaf\r\nfunction and the leaves have become reduced to mere spines. The various\r\nmodifications which shoots have undergone accompanying a change in\r\ntheir leaf relation will be discussed under stems in Chapter XXXIX.\r\n\r\n=694. (3d) Floral shoots.=—The floral shoot is the part of the\r\nplant bearing the flower. As interpreted here it may consist of but a\r\nsingle flower with its stalk, as in Trillium, mandrake, etc., or of\r\nthe clusters of flowers on special parts of the stem, termed flower\r\nclusters, as the _catkin_, _raceme_, _spike_, _umbel_, _head_, etc. In\r\nthe floral shoot as thus interpreted there are several peculiarities to\r\nobserve which distinguish it from the foliage shoot and adapt it to its\r\nlife relations.\r\n\r\nThe floral shoot in many respects is comparable to the foliage shoot,\r\nas seen from the following peculiarities:\r\n\r\n      (1) It usually possesses, beside the flowers, small\r\n    green leaves which are in fact foliage though they are\r\n    very much reduced in size, because the function of\r\n    the shoot as a foliage shoot is subordinated to the\r\n    function of the floral shoot. These small leaves on the\r\n    floral shoot are termed _bracts_.\r\n\r\n      (2) It may be (_a_) unbranched, when it would consist\r\n    of a single flower, or (_b_) branched, when there would\r\n    be several to many flowers in the flower cluster.\r\n\r\n      (3) The flower bud has the same origin on the shoot\r\n    as the leaf bud; it is either terminal or axillary, or\r\n    both.\r\n\r\n      (4) The members of the flower belong to the leaf\r\n    series, i.e., they are leaves, but usually different\r\n    in color from foliage leaves, because of the different\r\n    life relation which they have to perform. Evidence\r\n    of this is seen in the transition of sepals, petals,\r\n    stamens, or pistils, to foliage leaves in many flowers,\r\n    as in the pond lily, the abnormal forms of trillium,\r\n    and many monstrosities in other flowers (see Chapter\r\n    XXXIV).\r\n\r\n      (5) The position of the members of the flower on\r\n    its axis, though usually more crowded, in many cases\r\n    follows the same plan as the leaves on the stem.\r\n\r\nThe various kinds of floral shoots or flower clusters will be discussed\r\nin Chapter XLII, on the Floral Shoot.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Organization of Plant Tissues.\r\n\r\n=695.= A tissue is a group of cells of the same kind having a\r\nsimilar position and function. In large and bulky plants different\r\nkinds of tissue are necessary, not only because the work of the plant\r\ncan be more economically performed by a division of labor, but also\r\ncells in the interior of the mass or at a distance from the source\r\nof the food could not be supplied with food and air unless there\r\nwere specialized channels for conducting food and specialized tissue\r\nfor support of the large plant body. In these two ways most of the\r\nhigher plants differ from the simple ones. The tissues for conduction\r\nare sometimes called collectively the _mestome_, while tissues for\r\nmechanical support are called _stereome_. Division of labor has\r\ngone further also so that there are special tissues for absorption,\r\nassimilation, perception, reproduction, and the like. The tissues of\r\nplants are usually grouped into three systems: (1) The Fundamental\r\nSystem, (2) The Fibrovascular System, (3) The Epidermal System. Some of\r\nthe principal tissues are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. THE FUNDAMENTAL SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n=696. Parenchyma.=—Tissue composed of thin-walled cells which\r\nin the normal state are living. Parenchyma forms the loose and spongy\r\ntissue in leaves, as well as the palisade tissue (see Chapter IV); the\r\nsoft tissue in the cortex of root and stem (Fig. 414); as well as that\r\nof the pith, of the pith-rays or medullary rays of the stem; and is\r\nmixed in with the other elements of the vascular bundle where it is\r\nspoken of as wood parenchyma and bast parenchyma; and it also includes\r\nthe undifferentiated tissue (meristem) in the growing tips of roots and\r\nshoots; also the “intrafascicular” cambium (i.e., between the bundles,\r\nsome also include the cambium within the bundle).\r\n\r\n=697. Collenchyma.=—This is a strengthening tissue often found\r\nin the cortex of certain shoots. It also is composed of living cells.\r\nThe cells are thickened at the angles, as in the tomato and many other\r\nherbs (fig. 414).\r\n\r\n=698. Sclerenchyma, or stone-tissue.=—This is also a\r\nstrengthening tissue and consists of cells which do not taper at the\r\nends and the walls are evenly thickened, sometimes so thick that the\r\ninside (lumen) of the cell has nearly disappeared. Usually such cells\r\ncontain no living contents at maturity. Sclerenchyma is very common in\r\nthe hard parts of nuts, and underneath the epidermis of stems and\r\nleaves of many plants, as in the underground stems of the bracken fern,\r\nthe leaves of pines (fig. 415), etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 414. Transverse section of portion of tomato stem.\r\n_ep_, epidermis; _ch_ chlorophyll-bearing cells; _co_, collenchyma;\r\n_cp_, parenchyma.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 415. Margin of leaf of Pinus pinaster, transverse\r\nsection, _c_, cuticularized layer of outer wall of epidermis;\r\n_i_, inner non-cuticularized layer; _c´_, thickened outer wall of\r\nmarginal cell; _g_, _i´_, hypoderma of elongated sclerenchyma; _p_,\r\nchlorophyll-bearing parenchyma; _pr_, contracted protoplasmic contents.\r\n×800. (After Sachs.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 416. Section through a lenticel of Betula alba\r\nshowing stoma at top, phellogen below producing rows of flattened\r\ncells, the cork. (After De Bary.)]\r\n\r\n=699. Cork.=—In many cases there is a development of “cork”\r\ntissue underneath the epidermis. Cork tissue is developed by repeated\r\ndivision of parenchyma cells in such a way that rows of parallel cells\r\nare formed toward the outside. These are in distinct layers, soon lose\r\ntheir protoplasm and die; there are no intercellular spaces and the\r\ncells are usually of regular shape and fit close to each other. In\r\nsome plants the cell walls are thin (cork oak), while in others they\r\nare thickened (beech). The tissue giving rise to cork is called “cork\r\ncambium,” or phellogen, and may occur in other parts of the plant. For\r\nexample, where plants are wounded the living exposed parenchyma cells\r\noften change to cork cambium and develop a protective layer of cork.\r\nThe walls of cork cells contain a substance termed _suberin_, which\r\nrenders them nearly waterproof.\r\n\r\n=700. Lenticels.=—These are developed quite abundantly underneath\r\nstomates on the twigs of birch, cherry, beech, elder, etc. The\r\nphellogen underneath the stoma develops a cushion of cork which presses\r\noutward in the form of an elevation at the summit of which is the stoma\r\n(fig. 416). The lenticels can easily be seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. THE FIBROVASCULAR SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n=701. Fibrous tissue.=[39]—This consists of thick-walled cells,\r\nusually without living contents which are elongated and taper at the\r\nends so that the cells, or fibers, overlap. It is common as one of the\r\nelements of the vascular bundles, as wood fibers and bast fibers.\r\n\r\n=702. Vascular tissue, or tracheary tissue.=—This consists of the\r\nvessels or ducts, and tracheides, which are so characteristic of the\r\nvascular bundle (see Chapter V) and forms a conducting tissue for the\r\nflow of water. The vascular tissue contains spiral, annular, pitted,\r\nand scalariform vessels and tracheides according to the marking on the\r\nwalls (figs. 58, 59). These are all without protoplasmic contents when\r\nmature. There are also thin-walled living cells intermingled called\r\nwood parenchyma. In the conifers (pines, etc.) the tracheary tissue is\r\ndevoid of true vessels except a few spiral vessels in the young stage,\r\nwhile it is characterized by tracheides with peculiar markings. These\r\nmarks on the tracheides are due to the “bordered” pits appearing as two\r\nconcentric rings one within the other. These can be easily seen in a\r\nlongitudinal section of wood of conifers.\r\n\r\n=703. Sieve tissue.=—This consists of elongated tubular cells\r\nconnected at the ends, the cross walls being perforated at the ends.\r\nThese are in the phloem part of the bundle, and serve to conduct\r\ndownwards the dissolved substances elaborated in the leaves.\r\n\r\n=704. Fascicular cambium.=—This is the living, cell-producing\r\ntissue in the vascular bundle, which in the open bundle adds to the\r\nphloem on one side and the xylem on the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. THE EPIDERMAL SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n=705.= To the epidermal system belong the epidermis and the\r\nvarious outgrowths of its cells in the form of hairs, or _trichomes_,\r\nas well as the guard cells of the stomates, and probably some of the\r\nreproductive organs.\r\n\r\n=706. The epidermis.=—The epidermis proper consists of a\r\nsingle layer of external cells originating from the outer layer of\r\nparenchyma cells at the growing apex of the stem or root. These cells\r\nundergo various modifications of form. In many cases they lose their\r\nprotoplasmic contents. In many cases the outer wall becomes thickened,\r\nespecially in plants growing in dry situations or where they are\r\nexposed to drying conditions. The epidermal cells generally become\r\nconsiderably flattened, and are usually covered with a more or less\r\nwell developed waterproof cuticle, a continuous layer over the\r\nepidermis. In many plants the cuticle is covered with a waxy exudation\r\nin the form of a thin layer, or of rounded grains, or slender rods,\r\nor grains and needles in several layers. These waxy coverings are\r\nsometimes spoken of as “bloom” on leaves and fruit.\r\n\r\n=707. Trichomes.=—Trichome is a general term including various\r\nhair-like outgrowths from the epidermis, as well as scales, prickles,\r\netc. These include root hairs, rhizoids, simple or branched hairs,\r\nglandular hairs, glandular scales, etc. Glandular hairs are found on\r\nmany plants, as tomato, verbena, primula, etc.; glandular scales on\r\nthe hop; simple-celled hairs on the evening primrose, cabbage, etc.;\r\nmany-celled hairs on the primrose, pumpkin; branched hairs on the\r\nshepherd’s-purse, mullein, etc., stellate hairs on some oak leaves.\r\n\r\nFor stomates see Chapter IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. ORIGIN OF THE TISSUES.\r\n\r\n=708. Meristem tissue.=—The various tissues consisting of cells\r\nof dissimilar form are derived from young growing tissue known as\r\n_meristem_. Meristem tissue consists of cells nearly alike in form,\r\nwith thin cell walls and rich in protoplasm. It is situated at the\r\ngrowing regions of the plants. In the higher plants these regions in\r\ngeneral are three in number, the stem and root apex, and the cambium\r\ncylinder beneath the cortex. Tissues produced from the stem and root\r\napex are called _primary_, those from the cambium _secondary_. In most\r\ncases the main bulk of the plant is secondary tissue, while in the corn\r\nplant it is all primary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 417. Section through growing point of stem, _d_,\r\ndermatogen; _p_, plerome; periblem between. (After De Bary.)]\r\n\r\n=709. Origin of stem tissues.=—Just back of the apical meristem\r\nin a longitudinal section of a growing point it can be seen that the\r\ncells are undergoing a change in form, and here are organized three\r\nformative regions. The outer layer of cells is called _dermatogen_\r\n(skin producer), because later it becomes the epidermis. The central\r\ngroup of elongating cells is the _plerome_ (to fill). This later\r\ndevelops the _central cylinder_, or _stele_, as it is called\r\n(fig. 417). Surrounding the plerome and filling the space between it\r\nand the dermatogen is the third formative tissue called the _periblem_,\r\nwhich later forms the cortex (bark or rind), and consists of\r\nparenchyma, collenchyma, sclerenchyma, or cork, etc., as the case may\r\nbe. It should be understood that all these different forms and kinds\r\nof cells have been derived from meristem by gradual change. In the\r\nmature stems, therefore, there are three distinct regions, the central\r\ncylinder or stele, the cortex, and the epidermis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 418. Concentric bundle from stem of Polypodium\r\nvulgare. Xylem in the center, surrounded by phloem, and this by the\r\nendodermis. (From the author’s Biology of Ferns.)]\r\n\r\n=710. Central cylinder or stele.=—As the central cylinder is\r\norganized from the plerome it becomes differentiated into the vascular\r\nbundles, the pith, the pith-rays (medullary rays) which radiate from\r\nthe pith in the center between the bundles out to the cortex, and\r\nthe pericycle, a layer of cells lying between the central cylinder\r\nand the cortex. The bundles then are farther organized into the\r\nxylem and phloem portions with their different elements, and the\r\nfascicular cambium (meristem) separating the xylem and phloem, as\r\ndescribed in Chapter V. Such a bundle, where the xylem and phloem\r\nportions are separated by the cambium is called an open bundle (as\r\nin fig. 58). Where the phloem and xylem lie side by side in the same\r\nradius the bundle is a _collateral_ one. Dicotyledons and conifers are\r\ncharacterized by open collateral bundles. This is why trees and many\r\nother perennial plants continue to grow in diameter each year.\r\nThe cambium in the open bundle forms new tissue each spring and\r\nsummer, thus adding to the phloem on the outside and the xylem on\r\nthe inside. In the spring and early summer the large vessels in the\r\nxylem predominate, while in late summer wood fibers and small vessels\r\npredominate and this part of the wood is firmer. Since the vascular\r\nbundles in the stem form a circle in the cylinder, this difference\r\nin the size of the spring and late summer wood produces the “annual”\r\nrings, so evident in the cross-section of a tree trunk. Branches\r\noriginate at the surface involving epidermis, cortex, and the bundles.\r\n\r\nIn monocotyledonous plants (corn, palm, etc.) the bundles are not\r\nregularly arranged to form a hollow cylinder, but are irregularly\r\nsituated through the stele. There is no meristem, or cambium, left\r\nbetween the xylem and phloem portions of the bundle and the bundle is\r\nthus _closed_ (as in fig. 60), since it all passes over into permanent\r\ntissue. In most monocotyledons there is, therefore, practically no\r\nannual increase in diameter of the stem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 419. Section of stem (rhizome) of Pteris aquilina.\r\n_sc_, thick-walled sclerenchyma; _a_, thin-walled sclerenchyma; _par_,\r\nparenchyma.]\r\n\r\n=711. Ferns.=—In the ferns and most of the Pteridophytes an\r\napical meristem tissue is wanting, its place being taken by a single\r\napical cell from the several sides of which cells are successively\r\ncut off, though Isoetes and many species of Lycopodium have an apical\r\nmeristem group. In most of the Pteridophytes also the bundles are\r\n_concentric_ instead of collateral. Fig. 418 represents one of the\r\nbundles from the stem of the polypody fern. The xylem is in the center,\r\nthis surrounded by the phloem, the phloem by the phloem sheath, and\r\nthis in turn by the endodermis, giving a concentric arrangement of the\r\ncomponent tissues. A cross-section of the stem (fig. 419) shows two\r\nlarge areas of sclerenchyma, which gives the chief mechanical support,\r\nthe bundles being comparatively weak.\r\n\r\n=712. Origin of root tissues.=—A similar apical meristem exists\r\nin roots, but there is in addition a fourth region of formative\r\ntissue in front of the meristem called _calyptrogen_ (fig. 420). This\r\ngives rise to the “root cap” which serves to protect the meristem.\r\nThe vascular cylinder in roots is very different from that of the\r\nstem. There is a solid central cylinder in which the groups of xylem\r\nradiate from the center and groups of phloem alternate with them but\r\ndo not extend so near the center (fig. 421). As the root ages, changes\r\ntake place which obscure this arrangement more or less. Branches of\r\nthe roots arise from the central cylinder. In fern roots the apical\r\nmeristem is replaced by a single four-sided (tetrahedral) apical cell,\r\nthe root cap being cut off by successive divisions of the outer face,\r\nwhile the primary root tissues are derived from the three lateral faces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 420.

(After De Bary.)]\r\n\r\n=Function of the root cap.=—The root cap serves an important\r\nfunction in protecting the delicate meristem or cambium at the tip of\r\nthe root. These cells are, of course, very thin-walled, and while there\r\nis not so much danger that they would be injured from dryness, since\r\nthe soil is usually moist enough to prevent evaporation, they would be\r\nliable to injury from friction with the rough particles of soil. No\r\nsimilar cap is developed on the end of the stem, but the meristem here\r\nis protected by the overlapping bud-scales. One of the most striking\r\nillustrations of a root cap may be seen in the case of the Pandanus, or\r\nscrew-pine, often grown in conservatories (see fig. 447). On the prop\r\nroots which have not yet reached the ground the root caps can readily\r\nbe seen, since they are so large that they fit over the end of the root\r\nlike a thimble on the finger.\r\n\r\n=713.

The first and second topics can be conducted consecutively in the\r\nclassroom and laboratory. The third topic can be studied at opportune\r\ntimes during the progress of topics 1 and 2. For example, while\r\nstudying topic 1 excursions can be made to study winter conditions of\r\nbuds, shoots, etc., if in winter period, or the relations of leaves,\r\netc., to environment, if in the growing period. While studying topic 2\r\nexcursions can be made to study flower relations, and also vegetation\r\nrelations to environment (see Chapters XLVI-LVII of the author’s\r\n“College Text-book of Botany”). It is believed that a study of these\r\nthree general topics is of much more value to the beginning student\r\nthan the ordinary plant analysis and determination of species.\r\n\r\n[38] It is interesting to note that in some foliage shoots the stem is\r\nentirely subterranean. See discussion of the bracken fern and sensitive\r\nfern in Chapter XXXIX.\r\n\r\n[39] Some fibers occur also very frequently in the Fundamental System,\r\nforming bundle-sheaths, or strands of mechanical tissue in the cortex.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n\r\nTHE DIFFERENT TYPES OF STEMS. WINTER SHOOTS AND BUDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Erect Stems.\r\n\r\n=715. Columnar type.=—The columnar type of stem may be simple or\r\nbranched. When branching occurs the branches are usually small and in\r\ngeneral subordinate to the main axis. The sunflower (Helianthus annuus)\r\nis an example. The foliage part is mainly simple. The main axis remains\r\nunbranched during the larger part of the growth-period. The principal\r\nflowerhead terminates the stem. Short branches bearing small heads\r\nthen arise in the axils of a few of the upper leaves. In dry, poor\r\nsoil, or where other conditions are unfavorable, there may be only the\r\nsingle terminal flowerhead, when the stem is unbranched. The mullein\r\nis another columnar stem. The foliage part is rarely branched, though\r\nbranches sometimes occur where the main axis has become injured or\r\nbroken. The flower stem is terminal. The corn plant and the Easter lily\r\nare good illustrations also of the columnar stem.\r\n\r\nAmong trees the Lombardy poplar (Populus fastigiata) is an excellent\r\nexample of the columnar type. Though this is profusely branched, the\r\nbranches are quite slender and small in contrast with the main axis,\r\nunless by some injury or other cause two large axes may be developed.\r\nAs the technical name indicates, the branching is fastigiate, i.e., the\r\nbranches are crowded close together and closely surround the central\r\naxis. The royal palm and some of the tree ferns have columnar, simple\r\nstems, but the large, wide-spreading leaves at the top of the stem give\r\nthe plant anything but a cylindrical habit. Some cedars and arbor-vitæ\r\nare also columnar.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of the columnar habit of stem are three: (1) That the\r\nplant stands above other neighboring ones of equal foliage area and\r\nthus is enabled to obtain a more favorable light relation; (2) where\r\nlarge numbers of plants of the same species are growing close together,\r\nthey can maintain practically the same habit as where growing alone;\r\n(3) the advantage gained by other types in their neighborhood in less\r\nshading than if the type were spreading. The cylindrical type can,\r\ntherefore, grow between other types with less competition for existence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 422. Cylindrical stem of mullein.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 423. Conical type of larch.]\r\n\r\n=716. The cone type.=—This is well exampled in the larches,\r\nspruces, the gingko tree, some of the pines, cedars, and other\r\ngymnosperms. In the cone type, the main axis extends through the system\r\nof branches like a tall shaft, i.e., the trunk is _excurrent_. The\r\nlower branches are wide-spreading, and the branches become successively\r\nshorter, usually uniformly, as one ascends the stem. The branching is\r\nof two types: (1) the branches are in false whorls; (2) the branches are\r\ndistributed along the stem. To the first type belong the pines, Norway\r\nspruce, Douglas spruce, etc. _The white pine_ is an exquisite example,\r\nand in young and middle-aged trees shows the style of branching to\r\nvery good advantage. The branches are nearly horizontal, with a\r\nslight sigmoid graceful curve, while towards the top the branches are\r\nascending. This direction of the branches is due to the light relation.\r\nThe few whorls at the top are ascending because of the strong light\r\nfrom above. They soon become extended in a horizontal direction as the\r\nmain source of light is shifting to the side by the shading of the top.\r\nThe ascending direction first taken by the upper branches and their\r\nsubsequent turning downward, while the ends often still have a slight\r\nascending direction gives to the older branches their sigmoid curve.\r\n\r\nThe young vernal shoots of the pines show some very interesting\r\ngrowth movements. There are two growth periods: (1) the elongation of\r\nthe shoot, and (2) the elongation of the leaves. The elongation of the\r\nshoot takes place first and is completed in about six weeks or two\r\nmonths’ time. The direction of the shoot in the first period seems to\r\nbe entirely influenced by geotropism. It grows directly upward and\r\nstands up as a very conspicuous object in strong contrast with the dark\r\ngreen foliage of the more or less horizontal shoots. When the second\r\nperiod of growth takes place, and the leaves elongate, the shoot bends\r\ndownward and outward in a lateral direction.\r\n\r\nThe rate of growth of the pines can be very easily observed since each\r\nwhorl of branches (between the whorls of long shoots there are short\r\nshoots bearing the needle leaves), whether on the main axis or on the\r\nlateral branches, marks a year, the new branches arising each year\r\nat the end of the shoot of the previous year. The rate of growth is\r\nsometimes as high as twelve to twenty-four inches or more per year.\r\n\r\nThe _spruces_ form a more perfect cone than the pines. The long\r\nbranches are mostly in whorls, but often there are intermediate ones,\r\nthough the rate of growth per year can usually be easily determined. In\r\nthe _hemlock-spruce_, the branching is distributed. The _larch_ has a\r\nsimilar mode of branching, but it is deciduous, shedding its leaves in\r\nthe autumn, and it has a tall, conical form.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that trees of the cone type possessed certain advantages\r\nin some latitudes or elevations over other trees. (1) A conical tree,\r\nlike the spruces and larches and the pines, and hemlocks also, before\r\nthey get very old, meets with less injury during high winds than trees\r\nof an oval or spreading type. The slender top of the tree where the\r\nforce of the wind is greatest presents a small area to the wind, while\r\nthe trunk and short slender branches yield without breaking. Perhaps\r\nthis is one reason why trees of this type exist in more northern\r\nlatitudes and at higher elevations in mountainous regions, and why\r\nthe spruce type reaches a higher latitude and altitude even than the\r\npines. (2) The form of the tree is such as to admit light to a large\r\nfoliage area, even where the trees are growing near each other. The\r\nevergreen foliage, persistent for several years, on the wide-spreading\r\nlower branches, probably affords some protection to the trees since\r\nthis cover would aid in maintaining a more equable temperature in the\r\nforest cover than if the trees were bare during the winter. (3) There\r\nis less danger of injury from the weight of snow since the greater\r\nload of snow would lie on the lower branches. The form of the branches\r\nalso, especially in the spruces, permits them to bend downward without\r\ninjury, and if necessary unload the snow if the load becomes too heavy.\r\n\r\n=717. The oval type.=—This type is illustrated by the oak,\r\nchestnut, apple, etc. The trees are usually deciduous, i.e., cast\r\ntheir leaves with the approach of winter. The main axis is sometimes\r\nmaintained, but more often disappears (trunk is _deliquescent_),\r\nbecause of the large branches which maintain an ascending direction,\r\nand thus lessen the importance of the central axis which is so marked\r\nin the cone type. Trees of this type, and in fact all deciduous trees,\r\nexhibit their character or habit to better advantage during the winter\r\nseason when they are bare. Trees of this type are not so well adapted\r\nto conditions in the higher altitudes and latitudes as the cone type,\r\nfor the reason given in the discussion of that type. The deciduous\r\nhabit of the oaks, etc., enables them to withstand heavy winds far\r\nbetter than if they retained their foliage through the winter, even\r\nwere the foliage of the needle kind and adapted to endure cold.\r\n\r\n=718. The deliquescent type.=—The elm is a good illustration of\r\nthis type. The main axes and the branches fork by a false dichotomy, so\r\nthat a trunk is not developed except in the forest. The branches rise\r\nat a narrow angle, and high above diverge in the form of an arch. The\r\nchief foliage development is lofty and spreading.\r\n\r\nTrees possess several advantages over vegetation less lofty. They may\r\nstart their growth later, but in the end they outgrow the other kinds,\r\nshade the ground and drive out the sun-loving kinds.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Creeping, Climbing, and Floating Stems.\r\n\r\n=719. Prostrate type.=—This type is illustrated by creeping or\r\nprocumbent stems, as the strawberry, certain roses, of which a good\r\ntype is one of the Japanese roses (Rosa wichuriana), which creeps very\r\nclose to the ground, some of the raspberries, the cucurbits like the\r\nsquash, pumpkin, melons, etc. These often cover extensive areas by\r\nbranching and reaching out radially on the ground or climbing over low\r\nobjects. The cucurbits should perhaps be classed with the climbers,\r\nsince they are capable of climbing where there are objects for support,\r\nbut they are prostrate when grown in the field or where there are no\r\nobjects high enough to climb upon. In the prostrate type, there is\r\neconomy in stem building. The plants depend on the ground for support,\r\nand it is not necessary to build strong, woody trunks for the display\r\nof the foliage which would be necessary in the case of an erect plant\r\nwith a foliage area as great as some of the prostrate stems. This\r\ngain is offset, at least to a great extent, by the loss in ability to\r\ndisplay a great amount of foliage, which can be done only on the upper\r\nside of the stem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 424. Prostrate type of the water fern (_marsilia_).]\r\n\r\nOther advantages gained by the prostrate stems are protection from\r\nwind, from cold in the more rigorous climates, and some propagate\r\nthemselves by taking root here and there, as in certain roses, the\r\nstrawberry plant, etc. Some plants have erect stems, and then send\r\nout runners below which take root and aid the plant in spreading and\r\nmultiplying its numbers.\r\n\r\n=720. The decumbent type.=—In this type the stem is first erect,\r\nbut later bends down in the form of an arch, and strikes root where the\r\ntip touches the ground. Some of the raspberries and blackberries are of\r\nthis type.\r\n\r\n=721. The climbing type.=—The grapes, clematis, some roses, the\r\nivies, trumpet-creeper, the climbing bittersweet, etc., are climbing\r\nstems. Like the prostrate type, the climbers economize in the material\r\nfor stem building. They climb over shrubs, up the trunks of trees and\r\noften reach to a great height and acquire the power of displaying a\r\ngreat amount of foliage by sending branches out on the limbs of the\r\ntrees, sometimes developing an amount of foliage sufficient to cover\r\nand nearly smother the foliage of large trees; while the main stem of\r\nthe vine may be not over two inches in diameter and the trunk of the\r\nsupporting tree may be three feet in diameter.\r\n\r\n=722. Floating stems.=—These are necessarily found in aquatic\r\nplants. The stems may be ascending or horizontal. The stems are\r\nusually not very large, nor very strong, since the water bears them\r\nup. The plants may grow in shallow water, or in water 10-12 feet or\r\nmore deep, but the leaves are usually formed at or near the surface of\r\nthe water in order to bring them near the light. Various species of\r\nPotamogeton, Myriophyllum, and other plants common along the shores of\r\nlakes, in ponds, sluggish streams, etc., are examples. Among the algæ\r\nare examples like Chara, Nitella, etc., in fresh water; Sargassum,\r\nMacrocystis, etc., in the ocean. In these plants, however, the plant\r\nbody is a thallus, which is divided into stem-like (_caulidium_) and\r\nleaf-like (_phyllidium_) structures.\r\n\r\n=723. The burrowing type, or rhizomes.=—These are horizontal,\r\nsubterranean stems. The bracken fern, sensitive fern, the mandrake\r\n(see fig. 413_a_), Solomon’s seal, Trillium, Dentaria, and the like,\r\nare examples. The subterranean habit affords them protection from the\r\ncold, the wind, and from injury by certain animals. Many of these stems\r\nact as reservoirs for the storage of food material to be used in the\r\nrapid growth of the short-lived aerial shoot. In the ferns mentioned,\r\nthe subterranean is the only shoot, and this bears scale leaves which\r\nare devoid of chlorophyll, and foliage leaves which are larger, and the\r\nonly member of the plant body which is aerial. The foliage leaf has\r\nassumed the function of the aerial shoot. The latter is not necessary\r\nsince flowers are not formed. The mandrake, Solomon’s seal, Trillium,\r\netc., have scale leaves on the fleshy underground stems, while foliage\r\nleaves are formed on the aerial stems, the latter also bearing the\r\nflowers. Some of the advantages of the rhizomes are protection from\r\ninjury, food storage for the rapid development of the aerial shoot, and\r\npropagation.\r\n\r\nMany of the grasses have subterranean stems which ramify for great\r\ndistances and form a dense turf. For the display of foliage and for\r\nflower and seed production, aerial shoots are developed from these\r\nlateral upright branches.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. Specialized Shoots and Shoots for Storage of Food.[40]\r\n\r\n=724. The bulb.=—The bulb is in the form of a bud, but the scale\r\nleaves are large, thick, and fleshy, and contain stored in them food\r\nproducts manufactured in the green aerial leaves and transported to\r\nthe underground bases of the leaves. Or when the bulb is aerial in its\r\nformation, it is developed as a short branch of the aerial stem from\r\nwhich the reserve food material is transported. Examples are found\r\nin many lilies, as Easter lily, Chinese lilies, onion, tulip, etc.\r\nThe thick scale leaves are closely overlapped and surround the short\r\nstem within (also called a _tunicated_ stem). In many lilies there\r\nis a sufficient amount of food to supply the aerial stem for the\r\ndevelopment of flower and seed. There are roots, however, from the bulb\r\nand these acquire water for the aerial shoot, and when planted in soil\r\nadditional food is obtained by them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 425. Bulb of hyacinth.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 426. Corm of Jack-in-the-pulpit.]\r\n\r\n=725. Corm.=—A corm is a thick, short, fleshy, underground stem.\r\nA good example is found in the jack-in-the-pulpit (Arisæma).\r\n\r\n=726. Tubers.=—These are thickened portions of the subterranean\r\nstems. The most generally known example is the potato tuber (“Irish”\r\npotato, not the sweet potato, which is a root). The “eyes” of the\r\npotato are buds on the stem from which the aerial shoots arise when the\r\npotato sprouts. The potato tuber is largely composed of starch which is\r\nused for food by the young sprouts.\r\n\r\n=726=_a_. =Phylloclades.=—These are trees, shrubs, or\r\nherbs in which the leaves are reduced to mere bracts and stems,\r\nare not only green and function as leaves, but some or all of the\r\nbranches are flattened and resemble leaves in form as in Phyllanthus,\r\nRuscus, Semele, Asparagus, etc. The flowers are borne directly on\r\nthese flattened axes. The prickly-pear cactus (Opuntia) is also\r\na phylloclade. Examples of phylloclades are often to be found in\r\ngreenhouses.\r\n\r\n=727. Undifferentiated stems= are found in such plants as the\r\nduckweed, or duckmeat (Lemna, Wolffia, etc. See Chapter III).\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. Annual Growth and Winter Protection of Shoots and Buds.[41]\r\n\r\n=728. Winter conditions.=[42]—While herbs are subjected only to\r\nthe damp warm atmosphere of summer, woody plants are also exposed\r\nduring the cold dry winter, and must protect themselves against such\r\nconditions. The air is dryer in winter than in summer; while at the\r\nsame time root absorption is much retarded by the cold soil. Then, too,\r\nthe osmotic activity of the dormant twig-cells being much reduced, the\r\nwater-raising forces are at a minimum. It is easy to see, therefore,\r\nthat a tree in winter is practically under desert conditions. Moreover,\r\nit has been found by various investigators, contrary to the general\r\nbelief, that cold in freezing is only indirectly the cause of death.\r\nThe real cause is the abstraction of water from the cell by the ice\r\ncrystals forming in the intercellular spaces. Death ensues because the\r\nwater content is reduced below the danger-point for that particular\r\ncell. It was formerly thought that on freezing, the cells in the tissue\r\nwere ruptured. This is not so. Ice almost never forms within the cell,\r\nbut in the spaces between. Freezing then is really a drying process,\r\nand dryness, not cold, causes death in winter. To protect themselves\r\nin winter, trees provide various waterproof coverings for the exposed\r\nsurfaces and reduce the activity of the protoplasm so that it will be\r\nless easily harmed by the loss of water abstracted by the freezing\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 427. Two-year-old twig of horse-chestnut, showing\r\nbuds and leaf-scars. (A twig with a terminal bud should have been\r\nselected for this figure.)]\r\n\r\n=729. Protection of the twig.=—Woody plants protect the living\r\ncells within the twigs by the production of a dull or rough corky bark,\r\nor by a thick glossy epidermis over the entire surface. At intervals\r\noccur small whitish specks called lenticels, which here perform nearly\r\nthe same function as do stomates in the leaf.\r\n\r\n=730. Bark of trunk.=—A similar service is performed by the\r\nbark for the main trunk and branches of the tree. To admit of growth\r\nin diameter the old bark is constantly being thrown off in strips,\r\nflakes, etc., and replaced by a new but larger cylinder of young bark.\r\nThe external appearance thus produced enables experienced persons to\r\nrecognize many kinds of trees by the trunk alone.\r\n\r\n=731. Leaf-scars and bundle-scars.=—The presence of foliage\r\nleaves during the winter would greatly increase the transpiring surface\r\nwithout being of use to the plant; hence they are usually thrown off on\r\nthe approach of winter. The scars left by the fallen leaves are termed\r\nleaf-scars. The small dots on the leaf-scars left by the vascular\r\nbundles which extended through the petiole into the twig are termed\r\nbundle-scars. Sometimes stipule-scars are left on each side of the\r\nleaf-scar by the fallen stipules.\r\n\r\n=732. Nodes and internodes.=—The region upon a stem where a leaf\r\nis borne is termed a node. The space between two nodes is an internode.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 428.—Shoot of butternut showing leaf-scars,\r\naxillary buds, and adventitious buds (buds coming from above the\r\naxils).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 429.—Shoot and bud of white oak.]\r\n\r\n=733. Phyllotaxy.=—Investigation of a horse-chestnut or willow\r\ntwig will show that the leaf-scars occupy definite positions which\r\nare constant for each plant but different for the two species.\r\nThe arrangement of the leaves on the stem in any plant is termed\r\nphyllotaxy. In the horse-chestnut we find two scars placed at the same\r\nnode, but on opposite sides of the stem. Somewhat higher up we find two\r\nmore similarly placed, but in a position perpendicular to that of the\r\nfirst pair. Such phyllotaxy is termed opposite. If in any plant several\r\nleaves occur at a node, the phyllotaxy is whorled. If but one at each\r\nnode, as in the willow, the phyllotaxy is alternate. The opposite and\r\nalternate types are very commonly met with. Closer observation will\r\nshow that in the willow, if a line be drawn connecting the successive\r\nleaf-scars, it will pass spirally up the twig until at length a scar is\r\nreached directly over the one taken as a starting-point. Such spiral\r\narrangement always accompanies alternate phyllotaxy. The section of the\r\nspiral thus delineated is termed a cycle. We express the nature of the\r\ncycle by the fractions ½, ⅓, ⅖, ⅜, ⁵/₁₃, etc., in which the numerator\r\ndenotes the number of turns around the stem in each cycle, and the\r\ndenominator the number of leaf-scars in the same distance. In a general\r\nway we find in plants only such arrangements as are represented by\r\nthe fractions given above. These fractions show the curious condition\r\nthat the numerator and denominator of each is equal to the sum of\r\nthe numerator or denominator of the two preceding fractions. Much\r\nspeculation has been indulged in regarding the significance of these\r\ndefinite laws of leaf arrangement. In part they may be due to the\r\ndesire that each leaf receive the maximum amount of light. Only certain\r\ndefinite geometrical conditions will insure this. More likely it is due\r\nto the economy of space allotted to the leaf-fundaments in the bud.\r\nHere, again, geometrical laws govern this economy. The phyllotaxy is\r\nnearly constant for a given species.\r\n\r\n=734. Buds.=—The growing point of the stem or branch together\r\nwith its leaf or flower fundaments and protective structures is termed\r\na bud. Winter buds on woody plants are terminal when inclosing the\r\ngrowing point of the main axis of the twig; lateral when the growing\r\npoint is that of a branch of the main axis. Lateral buds are always\r\naxillary, i.e., situated on the upper angle between a leaf and the main\r\naxis.\r\n\r\n=735. Buds occupying special positions.=—Several species of trees\r\nand shrubs produce more than one bud in each leaf-axil. The additional\r\nones are termed accessory or supernumerary buds. These may be lateral\r\nto one another or they may be superposed as in the walnut or butternut.\r\nIn such cases some of the buds usually contain simply floral shoots and\r\nare termed flower buds. In some species buds are frequently produced\r\non the side of the branches and trunk at some distance from the\r\nleaf-axils, and entirely without regard for the latter; or more rarely\r\nmay occur upon the root. Such buds are termed adventitious, and are the\r\nsource of the feathery branchlets upon the trunks of the American elm.\r\n\r\n=736. Branching follows the phyllotaxy.=—Since the lateral or\r\nbranch-producing buds are always located in the axil of a leaf, the\r\nbranches necessarily follow the same arrangement upon the main axis\r\nas do the leaves. Since, however, many of the axillary buds fail to\r\ndevelop, this arrangement may be more or less obscured.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 430. Bud of European elm in section, showing\r\noverlapping of scales.]\r\n\r\n=737. Coverings of winter buds.=—These are of two sorts, hair\r\nand cork, or scales. Buds protected simply by dense hair or sunk in\r\nthe cork of the twig are termed naked buds, and are comparatively\r\nrare. Most species protect their buds by the addition of an imbricated\r\ncovering of closely appressed scales, the whole frequently being\r\nrendered still more waterproof by the excretion of resin between the\r\nscales or over the whole surface. The scales when studied carefully\r\nare found to be much reduced leaves or parts of leaves. In some cases\r\nthey represent a modified whole leaf, when they are said to be laminar,\r\nor a leaf-petiole, when they are petiolar, or stipular, when they are\r\nmuch-specialized stipules of a leaf which itself is usually absent. The\r\nlatter type is much the less common. The form of the bud, the nature\r\nand form of the scales, when combined with characters furnished by the\r\nleaf- and bundle-scars, enable one to recognize and classify the winter\r\ntwigs of the various woody species.\r\n\r\n=738. Phyllotaxy of the bud-scales.=—Since the bud-scales are\r\nleaves, they follow a definite phyllotaxy. This may or may not be\r\nthe same as that of the foliage leaves. Twigs with opposite leaves\r\nhave opposite bud-scales, or if with alternate leaves, then alternate\r\nbud-scales, but the fractions vary. If the scales are stipular, then\r\nthere are of course two at each node.\r\n\r\n=739. Function of the bud coverings.=—It is popularly believed\r\nthat the scales and hairy coverings serve to keep the bud warm.\r\nResearch, however, shows this to be almost entirely erroneous, and that\r\nthe thin bud coverings are entirely inadequate to keep out the cold of\r\nwinter. They cannot keep the bud even a degree or two warmer than the\r\noutside air, except when the changes are very rapid. Experiment also\r\nshows that the modifying effect of the covering when the bud thaws\r\nout is so slight as to be almost negligible. Indeed, a thermometer\r\nbulb covered with scales taken from a horse-chestnut bud warmed up\r\nmore rapidly than a naked one when exposed to sunshine. The wool in\r\nthe horse-chestnut bud is not for the purpose of keeping it warm, but\r\nto protect the young shoot from too great transpiration after the bud\r\nopens the following spring. Research has also shown that such tempering\r\nof the heat conditions is not especially beneficial to the plant,\r\nas was once thought. Neither can we find the main function in the\r\nprevention of water from entering the bud. This might be accomplished\r\nin much simpler ways, even if we could demonstrate the desirability of\r\nkeeping the water out at all.\r\n\r\nThe true functions of the bud-scales are two in number: Firstly, the\r\nprevention of too great loss of water from the young and delicate\r\nparts within; and secondly, the protection of these same parts from\r\nmechanical injury. Without some such protection the delicate young\r\nstructures would be beaten off by the wind, or become the food for\r\nhungry birds during the long winter months.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 431. Opening buds of hickory.]\r\n\r\n=740. Opening of the buds.=—When the young shoot begins to\r\ngrow in the spring, the bud-scales are forced apart or open of their\r\nown accord. During the young condition the shoot is very soft and\r\nbrittle, and also possesses a very thin, little cutinized epidermis.\r\nIn this condition it is especially liable to mechanical injury and to\r\ninjury from drying out. We find, therefore, a tendency for the inner\r\nbud-scales to elongate during vernation, thus forming a tube around the\r\ndelicate tissue much like the opening out of a telescope. The young\r\nleaves and internodes themselves are often provided with a woody or\r\nhairy covering to retard transpiration. When the epidermis becomes more\r\nefficient the hairy covering often falls away.\r\n\r\nIn the case of naked buds protection is afforded in other ways: by\r\nthe protection of hairy covering, by physiological adaptation of the\r\ntissue, or in many cases by the late appearance of the shoot in spring\r\nafter the very dry April and May winds have ceased.\r\n\r\n=741. Bud-scars, and how to tell the age of the plant.=—In\r\ngeneral the bud-scales when they fall away in the spring leave scars\r\ntermed scale-scars, and the whole aggregate of scale-scars makes up the\r\nbud-scar. The position of the buds of previous winters is, therefore,\r\nmarked. It becomes an easy matter to determine the age of a branch,\r\nsince all that is necessary is to follow back from one bud-scar to\r\nanother, the portion of the stem between representing, except in rare\r\ncases, one year’s growth.\r\n\r\nA woody plant grows in height only by the formation of new sections\r\nof stem added to the apex or side of similar sections produced the\r\nprevious season, never, as is commonly supposed, by the further\r\nelongation of the previous year’s growth. Hence a branch once formed\r\nupon a tree is fixed as regards its distance from the ground. The\r\napparent rise of the branches away from the ground in forest trees is\r\nan illusion caused by the dying away of the lower branches.\r\n\r\n=742. Definite and indefinite growth.=—With the opening of the\r\nbuds in spring, growth begins. In some cases, when all the members\r\nfor the season were formed, but still minute, within the bud, such\r\ngrowth consists solely in the expansion of parts already formed; in\r\nothers only a few members are thus present to expand, while new ones\r\nare produced by the growing point as the season progresses. In most\r\ncases growth is completed by the middle of July, soon after which buds\r\nare formed for next year’s growth. Such a method of growth is termed\r\ndefinite.\r\n\r\nIn a few woody plants, as, for example, sumach, locust, and raspberry,\r\ngrowth continues until late in the autumn. In such cases the most\r\nrecently formed nodes and internodes are unable to become sufficiently\r\n“hardened” before winter sets in, and are killed back more or less.\r\nNext season’s shoot is a branch from some axillary bud. Such growth is\r\ntermed indefinite.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 432. Three-year-old twig of the American ash, with\r\nsections of each year’s growth showing annual rings.]\r\n\r\n=743. Structure of woody stems.=—If we make a cross-section of a\r\nwoody twig three general regions are presented to view. On the outside\r\nis the rather soft, often greenish “bark,” so called, made up of\r\nsieve tubes, ordinary parenchyma cells, and in many cases long fibrous\r\ncells composing the “fibrous bark.” From a growing layer in this\r\nregion, termed the phellogen, the true corky bark of the older trunk is\r\nformed.\r\n\r\nNext within the bark we find the so-called “woody” portion of the\r\ntwig. This is strong and resistant to both breaking and cutting. The\r\nmicroscope shows it to be composed of the ordinary already known woody\r\nelements,[43] wood fibers, for strengthening purposes, pitted and spiral\r\nvessels as conducting tissue; and intermixed with these some living\r\nparenchyma cells. A cross-section of the stem also shows narrow radial\r\nlines through the wood. These are pith-rays, composed of vertical\r\nplates of living parenchyma cells. These cells, unlike the others in\r\nthe wood, are elongated radially, not vertically. The height of the\r\npith-rays as well as their thickness varies with the species studied.\r\nIn the older trunk only the outer portion, a few inches in thickness,\r\nremains light-colored and fresh, and is called sap-wood. The inner\r\nwood is usually darker and harder, and is termed heart-wood. Living\r\nparenchyma cells, in general, are present only in the sap-wood, and\r\nin this almost solely the ascent of sap occurs. Dyestuffs and other\r\nsubstances are frequently deposited in the walls of the heart-wood.\r\n\r\nThe third region occupying the center of the twig is the pith. This is\r\ncomposed ordinarily of angular, little elongated, parenchyma cells,\r\nwhen mature mostly without cell-contents and filled with air. The pith\r\nregion in different trees is quite diversified. It may be hollow,\r\nchambered, contain scattered thick-walled cells, have woody partitions,\r\nor rarely be entirely thick-walled.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the woody ring is rather perplexing at first; but\r\nits origin is simple. We may conceive that it has developed from a\r\nstem-type like the sunflower, in which the bundles, though separate,\r\nare connected by a continuous cambium ring. In the woody twigs the\r\nnumerous bundles are closely packed together, and only separated by\r\nthe primary pith-rays extending from the pith to the cortex. Other\r\nsecondary pith-rays are produced within each bundle, but they usually\r\nextend only part way from the cortex to the pith. The wood represents\r\nthe xylem of the bundle, and the sieve tubes of the bark, the phloem.\r\n\r\n=744. Growth in thickness.=—Although the year’s growth does not\r\nincrease in length after the first season has passed, it does increase\r\nin diameter very much. From the size of an ordinary little twig it may\r\nat length become a large tree trunk several feet in thickness. Only a\r\nportion of the first year’s growth is produced by the growing point.\r\nAll the rest is a product of the cambium, a cylinder of wood being\r\nadded to the exterior of the old wood each season. The cambium, here,\r\nas in the sunflower, lies between the phloem and the xylem, forming a\r\ncylinder entirely around the stem. In spring, when active, it becomes\r\nsoft and delicate, thus enabling one to easily strip off the bark from\r\nsome trees, such as willow, etc., at that season.\r\n\r\n=745. Annual rings in woody stems.=—The wood produced by the\r\ncambium each season is not homogeneous throughout, but is usually much\r\ndenser toward the outer part of the yearly cylinder, wood fibers here\r\npredominating. In the inner portion vessels predominate, giving a much\r\nmore porous effect. The transition from one year’s growth to another is\r\nvery abrupt, giving rise to the appearance of rings in cross-section.\r\nSince ordinarily in temperate climates but one cylinder of wood is\r\nadded each year, the number of rings will indicate the age of the trunk\r\nor branch. This is not absolutely accurate, since in some trees under\r\ncertain conditions more than one ring may be produced in a summer. The\r\nporous part of the ring is often termed “spring wood,” and the denser\r\nportion “fall wood,” but since growth from the cambium ceases in most\r\ntrees by the middle of July, “summer wood” would be more appropriate\r\nfor the latter. It is mainly the alternation of the cylinders of the\r\nspring and summer wood that gives the characteristic grain to lumber.\r\nPith-rays play an important part in wood graining only in a few woods,\r\nas, for instance, in quartered oak. The reason for the production of\r\nporous spring wood and dense summer wood is still one of the unsolved\r\nproblems of botany.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[40] Besides these specialized shoots for the storage of food,\r\nfood substances are stored in ordinary shoots. For example, in the\r\ntrunks of many trees starch is stored. With the approach of cold\r\nweather the starch is converted into oil, in the spring it is converted\r\ninto starch again, and later as the buds begin to grow the starch is\r\nconverted into glucose to be used for food. In many other trees, on the\r\nother hand, the starch changes to sugar on the approach of winter.\r\n\r\n[41] This topic was prepared by Dr. K. M. Wiegand.\r\n\r\n[42] See discussion of Tropophytes in Chapter XLVI.\r\n\r\n[43] Chapter V, and Organization of Tissues in Chapter XXXVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.\r\n\r\nFOLIAGE LEAVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. General Form and Arrangement of Leaves.\r\n\r\n=746. Influence of foliage leaves on the form of the stem.=—The\r\nmarked effect which foliage has upon the aspect of the plant or upon\r\nthe landscape is evident to all observers. Perhaps it is usual to\r\nlook upon the stem as having been developed for the display of the\r\nfoliage without taking into account the possibility that the foliage\r\nmay have a great influence upon the form or habit of the stem. It is\r\nvery evident, however, that the foliage exercises a great influence\r\non the form of the stem. For example, as trees increase in age and\r\nsize, the development of branches on the interior ceases and some of\r\nthose already formed die, since the dense foliage on the periphery\r\nof the trees cuts off the necessary light stimulus. The tree,\r\ntherefore, possesses fewer branches and a more open interior. In the\r\nforest also, the dense foliage above makes possible the shapely,\r\nclean timber trunks. Note certain trees where by accident, or by\r\ndesign, the terminal foliage-bearing branches have been removed that\r\nfoliage-bearing branches may arise in the interior of the tree system.\r\n\r\nWithout foliage leaves the stems of green plants would develop a very\r\ndifferent habit from what they do. This development could take place in\r\nthree different directions under the influence of light: (1) The light\r\nstimulus would induce profuse branching, so that there would be many\r\nsmall branches. (2) The stem would develop fewer branches, but they\r\nwould be flattened. (3) Massive trunks with but few or no branches. In\r\nfact, all these forms are found in certain green stems which do not\r\nbear leaves. An example of the first is found in asparagus with its\r\nnumerous crowded slender branches. But such forms in our climate are\r\nrare, since foliage leaves are more efficient. The second and third\r\nforms are found among cacti, which usually grow in dry regions under\r\nconditions which would be fatal to ordinary thin foliage leaves.\r\n\r\n=747. Relation of foliage leaves to the stem.=—In the study\r\nof the position of the leaves on the stem we observe two important\r\nmodes of distribution: (1) the distribution along the individual\r\nstem or branch which bears them, usually classed under the head of\r\n_Phyllotaxy_; (2) the distribution of the leaves with reference to the\r\nplant as a whole.\r\n\r\n=748. Phyllotaxy, or arrangement of leaves.=—In examining buds on\r\nthe winter shoots of woody plants, we cannot fail to be impressed with\r\nsome peculiarities in the arrangement of these members on the stem of\r\nthe plant.\r\n\r\nIn the horse-chestnut, as we have already observed, the leaves are in\r\npairs, each one of the pair standing opposite its partner, while the\r\npair just below or above stand across the stem at right angles to the\r\nposition of the former pair. In other cases (the common bed-straw) the\r\nleaves are in whorls, that is, several stand at the same level on the\r\naxis, distributed around the stem. By far the larger number of plants\r\nhave their leaves arranged alternately. A simple example of alternate\r\nleaves is presented by the elm, where the leaves stand successively on\r\nalternate sides of the stem, so that the distance from one leaf to the\r\nnext, as one would measure around the stem, is exactly one half the\r\ndistance around the stem. This arrangement is one half, or the angle of\r\ndivergence of one leaf from the next is one half. In the case of the\r\nsedges the angle of divergence is less, that is one-third.\r\n\r\nBy far the larger number of those plants which have the alternate\r\narrangement have the leaves set at an angle of divergence represented\r\nby the fraction two fifths. Other angles of divergence have been\r\ndiscovered, and much stress has been laid on what is termed a law in\r\nthe growth of the stem with reference to the position which the leaves\r\noccupy. Singularly by adding together the numerators and denominators\r\nof the last two fractions gives the next higher angle of divergence.\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n     1  +  2    3       2  +  3    5\r\n     —-   —- = —-;      —-   —- = —-;\r\n     3  +  5    8       5  +  8   13\r\n\r\nand so on. There are, however, numerous exceptions to this regular\r\narrangement, which have caused some to question the importance of any\r\ntheory like that of the “spiral theory” of growth propounded by Goethe\r\nand others of his time.\r\n\r\n=749. Adaptation in leaf arrangement.=—As a result, however, of\r\none arrangement or another we see a beautiful adaptation of the plant\r\nparts to environment, or the influence which environment, especially\r\nlight, has had on the arrangement of the leaves and branches of the\r\nplant. Access to light and air are of the greatest importance to\r\ngreen plants, and one cannot fail to be profoundly impressed with the\r\nworkings of the natural laws in obedience to which the great variety of\r\nplants have worked out this adaptation in manifold ways.\r\n\r\n=750. Distribution of leaves with reference to the entire\r\nplant.=—In this case, as in the former, we recognize that it is\r\nprimarily a light relation. As the plant becomes larger and more\r\nbranched the lower and inner leaves disappear. The trees and shrubs\r\nhave by far the larger number of leaves on the periphery of the branch\r\nsystem. A comparison of different kinds of trees in this respect shows,\r\nhowever, that there is great variation. Trees with dense foliage (elm,\r\nNorway maple, etc.) present numerous leaves on the periphery which\r\nadmit but little light to the interior where leaves are very few or\r\nwanting. The sugar maple and red maple do not cast such a dense shade\r\nand there are more leaves in the interior. This is more marked in the\r\nsilver maple, and still more so in the locust (Gleditschia tricanthos).\r\n\r\n=751. Color of foliage leaves.=—The great majority of foliage\r\nleaves are green in color. This we have learned (Chapter VII) is due\r\nto the presence of a green pigment, chlorophyll, in the chloroplastids\r\nthickly scattered in the cells of the leaf. We have also learned that\r\nin the great majority of cases, the light stimulus is necessary for\r\nthe production of chlorophyll green. There are many foliage leaves\r\nwhich possess other colors, as red (Rosa rubrifolia), purple (the\r\npurple barberry, hazel, beech, birch, etc.), yellow (the golden oak,\r\nelder, etc.); while many others have more or less deep tints of pink,\r\nred, purple, yellow, when young. All of these leaves, however, possess\r\nchlorophyll in addition to red, yellow, purple or other pigment.\r\nThese other pigments are sometimes developed in great quantity in the\r\ncell-sap. They obscure the chlorophyll from view, but do not interfere\r\nseriously with the action of light and the function of chlorophyll, and\r\nperhaps in some cases serve as a screen to protect the protoplast.\r\n\r\n=752. Autumn colors.=—Foliage leaves of many trees display in\r\nthe autumn gorgeous colors. These colors are principally shades of\r\nred or yellow, and sometimes purple. The autumn color is more marked\r\nin some trees than in others. In the red maple, the red and scarlet\r\noak, the sourwood, etc., red predominates, though sometimes yellow\r\nmay be present with the red in a single leaf. Sugar maples, poplars,\r\nhickories, etc., are principally yellow in autumn. The sweet gum has a\r\nrich variety of color-red, purple, maroon, yellow; sometimes all these\r\ncolors are present on the same tree.\r\n\r\nThe red and purple colors are found suffused in the cell-sap of\r\ncertain cells in the leaf much as we have found it in the cells of\r\nthe red beet. The yellow color is chiefly due to the disappearance\r\nand degeneration of the chlorophyll while the leaf is in a moribund\r\nstate. A similar phenomenon is seen in the yellowing of crops when\r\nthe soil becomes too wet, or in the blanching of grass when covered\r\nwith a board, or of celery as the earth is ridged up over the leaves\r\nin late summer and autumn. A number of different theories have been\r\nadvanced to explain autumn coloring, i.e., the appearance of the\r\nred coloring matter. It has been attributed to the approach of cold\r\nweather, and this has likely led to the erroneous belief on the part\r\nof some that it is caused by frost. It very often precedes frost. Some\r\nhave attributed it to the action of the more oblique light rays during\r\nautumn, and still others to the diminishing water-supply with the\r\napproach of cool weather. The question is one which has not met as yet\r\nwith a satisfactory solution, and is certainly a very obscure one. It\r\nis likely that the low temperature or the declining activities of the\r\nleaf affect certain organic substances in the leaf and give rise to\r\nthe red color, and it is quite certain that in some years the display\r\nis more brilliant than in others. The color is more striking in some\r\nregions than in others and the different soil, as well as climate, has\r\nbeen supposed to have some influence. The North American forests are\r\nnoted for the brilliant display of autumnal color. This is perhaps due\r\nto some extent to the great variety or number of species which display\r\ncolor. It would seem that there is some specific as well as individual\r\npeculiarities in certain trees. Some individuals, for example, exhibit\r\nbrilliant colors every autumn, while others near of the same species\r\nare more subdued.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown by experiment that when sunlight passes through\r\nred colors the temperature is slightly increased, and it has been\r\nsuggested that this may be of protection to the living substance which\r\nhas ceased working and is in danger of injury from cold. There does\r\nnot seem to be much ground for this suggestion, however. It certainly\r\ncould not protect the protoplasm of the leaf at night when the cold\r\nis more intense, and during the day would only aggravate matters\r\nby supplying an increased amount of heat, since extremes of heat\r\nand cold in alternation are more harmful to plant life than uniform\r\ncold. Especially would this be the case in alpine climates where the\r\nalternation of heat and cold between day and night is extreme, and\r\nbrilliancy of the colors of alpine plants is well known. It seems\r\nmore reasonable to suppose that the red color acts as a screen, as\r\nthe chlorophyll is disappearing, to protect from the injurious action\r\nof light, certain organic substances which are to be transferred back\r\nfrom the leaf to the stem for winter storage. So in the case of many\r\nstems in the spring or early summer when the young leaves often have\r\na reddish color, it is likely that it acts as a screen to protect the\r\nliving substance from the strong light at that season of the year until\r\nthe chlorophyll screen, which is weak in young leaves, becomes darker\r\nin color and more effective, when the red color often disappears.\r\n\r\n=753. Function of foliage leaves.=—In general the function of\r\nthe foliage leaf as an organ of the plant is fivefold (see Chapters\r\nIV, VII, VIII, XI), (1) that of carbon dioxide assimilation or\r\n_photosynthesis_, (2) that of transpiration, (3) that of the synthesis\r\nof other organic compounds, (4) that of respiration, and (5) that of\r\nassimilation proper, or the making of new living substance. While none\r\nof these functions are solely carried on in the leaf, it is the chief\r\nseat of the first three of these processes, its form, position, and\r\nstructure being especially adapted to the purpose. Assimilation proper,\r\nas well as respiration, probably take place equally in all growing or\r\nactive parts.\r\n\r\n=754. Parts of the leaf.=—All foliage leaves possess a _blade_\r\nor _lamina_, so called because of its _expanded_ and _thin_ character.\r\nThe blade is the essential part. Many leaves, however, are provided\r\nwith a stalk or _petiole_ by which the blade is held out at a greater\r\nor lesser distance from the stem. Leaves with no petiole are _sessile_,\r\nthe blade is attached by one end directly on the stem. In some cases\r\nthe base of the blade is wrapped partly around the stem, or in others\r\nit extends entirely around the stem and is _perfoliate_. Besides, many\r\nleaves have short appendages, termed _stipules_, attached usually on\r\nopposite sides of the petiole at its junction with the stem. In some\r\nspecies of magnolia the stipules are so large that each one envelops\r\nthe entire portion of the bud which has not yet opened. Many leaves\r\npossess outgrowths in the form of hairs, scales, etc. (See leaf\r\nprotection.)\r\n\r\n=755. Simple leaves.=—Simple leaves are those in which the\r\nblade is plane along the edge, not divided. The edge may be entire or\r\nindented (serrate) to a slight extent as in the elm. The form of the\r\nsimple leaf varies greatly but is usually constant for a given species,\r\nor it may vary in shape in the same species on different parts of the\r\nplant. Some of the terms applied to the outline of the leaf are ovate,\r\noval, elliptical, lanceolate, linear, needle-like, etc., but it is idle\r\nfor one to waste time on matters of minute detail in form until it\r\nbecomes necessary for those in the future who pursue taxonomic work. It\r\nis evident that a simple leaf, except those of minute size, possesses\r\nadvantages over a divided leaf in the amount of surface it exposes to\r\nthe light. But in other respects it is at a disadvantage, especially\r\nas it increases in size, since it casts a deeper shade and does not\r\nadmit of such a free circulation of air. It will be found, however, in\r\nour study of the relation of leaves to light and air that the balance\r\nbetween the leaf and its environment is obtained in the relation of the\r\nleaves to each other.\r\n\r\n=756. Venation of leaves.=—A very prominent character of the\r\nleaf is its “venation.” This is indicated by the presence of numerous\r\n“veins,” indicated usually by narrow depressed lines on the upper\r\nsurface, and by more or less distinct elevated lines on the under\r\nsurface. There are two general types: (1) In the corn, Smilacina,\r\nSolomon’s seal, etc., the veins extend lengthwise of the leaf and\r\nare nearly parallel. Such leaves are said to be _parallel-veined_.\r\nIt is generally, though not always, a character of monocotyledenous\r\nplants. (2) In the elm, rose, hawthorn, maple, oak, etc., the veins\r\nare not all parallel. The larger ones either diverge from the base\r\nof the blade (palmate leaf, maple), or the midvein extends through\r\nthe middle line of the leaf, while other prominent ones branch off\r\nfrom this and extend, nearly parallel, toward the edge of the leaf\r\n(pinnate venation). The smaller intermediate veins which are also\r\nvery distinct extend irregularly and branch and anastomose in such a\r\nfashion as to give the figure of a net with very fine meshes. These\r\nare _netted-veined_ leaves. These are characteristic of most of the\r\ndicotyledenous plants. It is evident from what has been said of the\r\nexamples cited that there are two types of netted-veined leaves, the\r\n_palmate_ and _pinnate_.\r\n\r\n      NOTE. As we have already learned in Chapter\r\n    V the veins contain the vascular bundles of the\r\n    leaf. Through them the water and food solutions are\r\n    distributed to all parts of the leaf, and the return\r\n    current of food material elaborated in the leaf moves\r\n    back through the bast portion into the shoot. The veins\r\n    also possess a small amount of mechanical tissue. This\r\n    forms the framework of the leaf and aids in giving\r\n    rigidity to the leaf and in holding it in the expanded\r\n    position. The mechanical tissue in the framework\r\n    alone could not support the leaf. Turgescence of the\r\n    mesophyll is needed in addition.\r\n\r\n=757. Cut or lobed leaves.=—In many leaves, the indentations\r\non the margin are few and deep. Such leaves present several lobes\r\nthe proportionate size of which is dependent upon the depth of the\r\nindentation or “incision.” Several of the maples, oaks, birches, the\r\npoison ivy, thistles, the dandelion, etc., have lobed leaves. Where\r\nthe indentation reaches to or very near the midrib the leaf is said\r\nto be cut. A study of various leaves will show all gradations from\r\nsimple leaves with plane edges to those which are cut or divided, as in\r\ncompound leaves, and the lobes are often variously indented.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 433. Lobed leaves of oak forming a mosaic.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 434. Twice compound leaf. Leaflets arranged in one\r\nplane, but open spaces permit free circulation of air through the large\r\nleaf.]\r\n\r\n=758. Divided, or compound leaves.=—The rose, sumac, elder,\r\nhickory, walnut, locust, pea, clover, American creeper, etc., are\r\nexamples of divided or compound leaves. The former are pinnately\r\ncompound, and the latter are palmately compound. The leaf of the\r\nhoney-locust is twice pinnately compound or bipinnate, and some are\r\nthree times pinnately compound.[44] It is evident that compound leaves\r\nare only extreme forms of lobed or cut leaves and that the form of all\r\nbears a definite relation to the primary venation. There has been a\r\nreduction of mesophyll and of the area of smaller venation.\r\n\r\n_Unifoliate_ (for a single leaflet, as in orange and lemon where\r\nthe compound leaf is greatly reduced and consists of one pinna\r\nattached to the petiole by a joint). _Bifoliate_ for one with two\r\nleaflets; _trifoliate_ for one with three leaflets, as in the clover;\r\n_plurifoliate_ for many leaflets. _Odd pinnate_ for a pinnate leaf with\r\none or more pairs of leaflets and one odd leaflet at the end.\r\n\r\nSo leaves are _palmately bifoliate_, etc., _pinnately bifoliate_, etc.\r\n_Decompound_ leaves are those where they are more than twice compound,\r\nas _ternately decompound_ in the common meadow rue (Thalictrum).\r\n\r\n_Perfoliate_ leaves are seen in the bellwort (Uvularia), _connate\r\nperfoliate_, as in some of the honeysuckles where the bases of opposite\r\nleaves are joined together around the stem. _Equitant_ leaves are found\r\nin the iris, where the leaves fit over one another at the base like a\r\nsaddle.\r\n\r\n=759.= These forms of leaves probably have some definite\r\nsignificance. It is not quite clear why they should have developed as\r\nthey have; though it is possible to explain several important relations\r\nof these forms to their environment. (1) The reduction of the surface\r\nof the leaf, with the retention of the firmer portions, allows freer\r\nmovement of the air and affords the leaf greater protection from injury\r\nduring violent winds, just as the finely dissected leaves of some\r\nwater plants are less liable to injury from movement of the more dense\r\nmedium in which they live. It is possible that here we may have an\r\nexplanation of one of the factors involved in this reduction of leaf\r\nsurface. (2) In trees with compound leaves, like the hickory, walnut,\r\nlocust, ailanthus, etc., the midvein, and in the case of the Kentucky\r\ncoffee-tree (Gymnocladus) the primary lateral veins also, serve in\r\nplace of terminal branches of the stem. By the increase in the outline\r\nof the leaf and the reduction of its surface between the larger veins,\r\nthe tree has attained the same leaf development that it would were the\r\nlarger veins replaced by stems bearing simple leaves. The tree as\r\nit is, however, has the advantage of being able to cast off for the\r\nwinter period a layer of what otherwise would have been a portion of\r\nthe stem system, to retain which through the winter would use more\r\nenergy than with the present reduced stem system, and the stouter\r\nstem is less liable to dry out. In the case of herbaceous plants, in\r\nthe case of plants like most of the ferns where the stem is on the\r\nunderground rootstock (Pteris), or a very short erect stem, as in the\r\nChristmas fern, the leaf replaces the aerial stem, and the division (or\r\nbranching, as it is sometimes styled) of the leaf corresponds to the\r\nbranching of the stem. This is more marked in the gigantic exotics like\r\nCibotium regale, and in the tree ferns which have quite tall trunks,\r\nthe massive compound leaves replace branches. In the palms and cycads\r\nare similar examples. Those who choose to observe can doubtless find\r\nmany examples close at hand. (3) While divided leaves have probably not\r\nbeen evolved in response to the light relation, still their relation in\r\nthis respect is an important one, since if the leaf with its present\r\nsize were entire, it would cast too dense a shade on other leaves below.\r\n\r\n=760. General structure of the leaf.=—The general structure of\r\nthe leaf has been already studied (see Chapters IV, V, VII). It is\r\nonly necessary to recall the main points. The upper and lower surfaces\r\nof the leaf are provided with a layer of cells usually devoid of\r\nchlorophyll. The mesophyll of the leaf consists usually of a layer of\r\npalisade cells beneath the epidermis, and the remainder consists of\r\nloose parenchyma with large intercellular spaces. Through the mesophyll\r\ncourse the “veins,” or fibrovascular strands, consisting of the xylem\r\nand phloem portions and serving as conduits for water, salts, and\r\nfoodstuffs. In the epidermis are the stomata, each one protected by\r\nthe two guard cells. The guard cells as well as the mesophyll contain\r\nchlorophyll. The stomata and the communicating intercellular spaces\r\nfurnish the avenues for the ingress and egress of gases, and for the\r\nescape of water vapor.\r\n\r\n=761. Protection of leaves.=—There are many modifications of\r\nthe general plan of structure in different leaves, many of them being\r\nadaptations for the protection of the leaf under adverse or trying\r\nconditions. Many leaves are also capable of assuming certain positions\r\nwhich afford them protection. The discussion of this subject may be\r\npresented under two general heads: Protective modifications; protective\r\npositions.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Protective Modification of Leaves.\r\n\r\n=762. General directions in which these modifications have taken\r\nplace.=—The usual type of foliage leaf selected is that of\r\ndeciduous trees or shrubs or of our common herbs. Such a leaf is\r\nusually greatly expanded and thin in order to present as great a\r\nsurface as possible in comparison with its mass, since the kind of\r\nwork which the leaf has to do can be more effectually carried on when\r\nit possesses this form. This form of leaf is best adapted for work in\r\nregions where there is a medium amount of moisture such as exists in\r\nthe temperate zones. But since there are very great variations in the\r\nclimatic and soil conditions of these regions, and even greater changes\r\nin desert and arctic regions, the type of leaf described is unsuited\r\nfor all. Its own life would be endangered, and it would also endanger\r\nthe life of the plant. Modifications have therefore taken place to\r\nmeet these conditions, or at least those plants whose leaves have\r\nbecome modified in those directions which are suited to the surrounding\r\nconditions have been able to persist. Excessive cold or heat, drought,\r\nwinds, intense light, rain, etc., are some of the conditions which\r\nendanger leaves. The protective modifications of leaves may be grouped\r\nunder four general heads: (1) Structural adaptations; (2) Protective\r\ncovering; (3) Reduction of surface; (4) Elimination of the leaf through\r\nthe complete assumption of the leaf function by the stem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 435. Structure of leaf of Lactuca scariola. Upper\r\none grown in sunlight, palisade cells on both sides. Lower one grown in\r\nshade, no palisade tissue.]\r\n\r\n=763.= (1) =Structural adaptations.=—The general structure\r\nof the leaf presents certain features which are protective. The\r\npalisade layer of cells found usually beneath the upper epidermis forms\r\na compact layer of long cells which not only acts as a light screen\r\ncutting off a certain amount of the light, since too intense light\r\nwould be harmful; it also aids in lessening the loss of water from the\r\nupper surface, where radiation is greater. The stomata are usually on\r\nthe under side of aerial leaves, and the mechanism which closes them\r\nwhen the leaf is losing too much water is protective. As a protection\r\nagainst intense light the number of palisade layers is sometimes\r\nincreased or the cells of this layer are narrow and long. This is often\r\nbeautifully shown when comparing leaves of the same plant grown in\r\nstrong light with those grown in the shade. The compass plant (Lactuca\r\nscariola) affords an interesting example. The leaves grown in the light\r\nare usually vertical, so that the light reaches both sides. Such leaves\r\noften have all of the mesophyll organized into palisade cells (fig.\r\n435), while leaves grown in the deep shade may have no palisade cells.\r\n\r\n=764.= (2) =Protective covering.=—_Epidermis and\r\ncuticle._—The walls of the epidermal cells are much thickened in some\r\nplants. Sometimes this thickening occurs in the outer wall, or both\r\nwalls may be thickened. Variation in this respect as well as the extent\r\nof the thickening occur in different plants and are often correlated\r\nwith the extremes of conditions which they serve to meet. The cuticle,\r\na waxy exudation from the thick wall of the epidermis of many leaves,\r\nalso serves as a protection against too great loss of water, or against\r\nthe leaf becoming saturated with water during rains. The cabbage,\r\ncarnation, etc., have a well-developed cuticle. The effect of the\r\ncuticle in shedding water can be nicely shown by spraying water on a\r\ncabbage leaf or by immersing it in water. Sunken stomata also retard\r\nthe loss of water vapor.\r\n\r\n_Covers of hair or scales._—In many leaves certain of the cells of the\r\nepidermis grow out into the form of hairs or scales of various forms,\r\nand they serve a variety of purposes. When the hairs form a felt-like\r\ncovering as in the common mullein, some antennarias, etc., they lessen\r\nthe loss of water vapor because the air-currents close to the surface\r\nof the leaf are retarded. Spines (see the thistles, etc.) also afford a\r\nprotection against certain animals.\r\n\r\n=765.= (3) =Reduction of surface.=—Reduction of leaf surface\r\nis brought about in a variety of ways. There are two general modes:\r\n(1st) Reduction of surface along with reduction of mass; (2d) Reduction\r\nof surface inversely as the mass. Examples of the first mode are\r\nseen in the dissected leaves of many aquatic plants. In this finely\r\ndissected condition the mass of the leaf substance is much reduced as\r\nwell as the leaf surface, but the leaf is less liable to be injured\r\nby movement of the water. In addition it has already been pointed out\r\nthat lobed and divided aerial leaves are much less liable to injury\r\nfrom violent movements of the air, than if a leaf with the same general\r\noutline were entire. The needle leaves of the conifers are also\r\nexamples, and they show as well structural provisions for protection\r\nin the thick, hard cell-walls of the epidermis. To offset the reduced\r\nsurface there are numerous crowded leaves. Reduction of surface\r\ninversely as the mass, i.e., the mass of the leaf may not be reduced\r\nat all, or it may be more or less increased. In other words, there is\r\nless leaf surface in proportion to the mass of leaf substance. It is\r\nprobable in many cases, example: the crowded, overlapping small scale\r\nleaves of the juniper, arbor-vitæ, cypress, cassiope, pyxidanthera,\r\netc., that there has been a reduction in the size of the leaf, and at\r\nthe same time an increase in thickness. This with the crowding together\r\nof the leaves and their thick cell-walls greatly lessens the radiation\r\nof moisture and heat, thus protecting the leaves both in dry and cold\r\nweather. The succulents, like “live-forever,” have a small amount of\r\nsurface in proportion to the mass of the leaf. In the yucca, though the\r\nleaves are often large, they are very thick and expose a comparatively\r\nsmall amount of surface to the dry air and intense sunlight of the\r\ndesert regions. The epidermal covering is also hard and thick. In\r\naddition, such leaves, as well as those of many succulents, are so\r\nthick they provide water storage sufficient for the plants, which\r\nradiate so slowly from their surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 436. A “Phylloclade,” leaves absent, stems\r\nbroadened to function as leaves, on the edges numerous flowers are\r\nborne.]\r\n\r\n=766.= (4) =Elimination of the leaf.=—Perhaps the most\r\nstriking illustration of the reduction of leaf surface is in those\r\ncases where the leaf is either completely eliminated as in certain\r\neuphorbias, or in certain of the cacti where the leaves are thought\r\nto be reduced to spines. Whether the cactus spine belongs to the\r\nleaf series or not, the leaf as an organ for assimilation and\r\ntranspiration has been completely eliminated and the same is true in\r\nthe phylloclades. The leaf function has been assumed by the stem. The\r\nstem in this case contains all the chlorophyll; is bulky, and provides\r\nwater storage.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. Protective Positions.\r\n\r\n=767.= In many cases the leaves are arranged either in relation\r\nto the stem, or to each other, or to the ground, in such a way as to\r\ngive protection from too great radiation of heat or moisture. In the\r\nexamples already cited the imbricated leaves of cassiope, pyxidanthera,\r\njuniper, etc., come also under this head. In the junipers the leaves\r\nspread out in the summer, while in the winter they are closely\r\noverlapped. An interesting example of protective position is to be seen\r\nin the case of the leaves of the white pine. During quite cold winter\r\nweather the needles are appressed to the stem, and sometimes the trees\r\npresent a striking appearance in contrast with the spreading position\r\nof the needles in summer. On windy days in winter, the needles turn\r\nwith the wind and become rigid in that position so that they remain in\r\na horizontal position for some time, often until the wind dies down,\r\nor until milder weather. The following day, should there be a cold\r\nstrong wind from the opposite direction, the needles again assume a\r\nleeward direction. In quiet weather appressed to the stem and in the\r\nform of a brush there is less radiation of heat than if they diverged.\r\nIn strong winds by turning in the leeward direction the wind is not\r\ndriven between the needle bases and scales. Some plants, especially\r\nmany of those in arctic and alpine regions, have very short stems and\r\nthe leaves are developed near the ground, or the rock. Lying close on\r\nthe ground they do not feel the full force of the drying winds, there\r\nis less radiation from them, and the radiation of heat from the ground\r\nprotects them. Many plants exhibit movement in response to certain\r\nstimuli which place them in a position for protection. Some of these\r\nexamples have been discussed under the head of irritability (see\r\nChapter XIII). The night position of leaves and cotyledons presented\r\nby many plants, but especially by many of the Leguminosæ, is brought\r\nabout by the removal of the light stimulus at evening. In many leaves,\r\nwhen the light influence is removed, the influence of growth turns\r\nthe leaves downward, or the cotyledons of some plants upward. In this\r\nvertical position of the leaf-blade there is less radiation of heat\r\nduring the cool night. The most striking cases of protection movements\r\nare seen in the sensitive plant. As we have seen, the leaves of mimosa\r\nclose in a vertical position at midday if the light and heat are too\r\nstrong. Excessive transpiration is thus prevented. At night the vertical\r\nposition prevents excessive radiation of heat. The vertical or profile\r\nposition of the leaves of the compass plant already referred to not\r\nonly lessens transpiration, but the intense heat and light of the\r\nmidday sun is avoided. This profile position is characteristic of\r\ncertain plants in the dry regions of Australia, and the topmost leaves\r\nof tropical forests.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. Relation of Leaves to Light.\r\n\r\n=768.= It is very obvious from our study of the function of the\r\nfoliage leaf that its most important relation to environment is that\r\nwhich brings it in touch with light and air. It is necessary that light\r\npenetrate the leaf tissue that the gases of the air and plant may\r\nreadily diffuse and that water vapor may pass out of the leaf. The thin\r\nexpanded leaf-blade is the most economical and efficient organ for leaf\r\nwork. We have seen that leaves respond to fight stimulus in such a way\r\nas to bring their upper sides usually to face the source of fight, at\r\nright angles to it or nearly so (_heliotropism_, see Chapter XIII). How\r\nfully this is brought about depends on the kind of plant, as well as on\r\nother elements of the environment, for as we have seen in our study of\r\nleaf protection there is danger to some plants in any region, and to\r\nother plants in certain regions that the intense light and heat may\r\nharm the protoplast, or the chlorophyll, or both.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 437. Mosaic form by trailing shoots of Panicum\r\nvariegatum, “ribbon-grass.”]\r\n\r\nThe statement that leaves usually face the light at right angles is to\r\nbe taken as a generalized one. The source of the strongest illumination\r\nvaries on different days and again at different times of the day.\r\nOn cloudy days the zenith is the source of strongest illumination.\r\nThe horizontal position of a leaf, where there are no intercepting\r\nlateral or superior objects would receive its strongest light rays\r\nperpendicular to its surface. The fact is, however, that leaves on the\r\nsame stem, because of taller or shorter adjacent stems, are so situated\r\nthat the rays of greatest illuminating power are directed at some angle\r\nbetween the zenith and horizon. Many leaves, then, which may have\r\ntheir upper sides facing the general source of strongest illumination,\r\ndo not necessarily face the sun, and they are thus protected from\r\npossible injury from intense light and heat because the direct rays of\r\nsunlight are for the most part oblique. This does not apply, of course,\r\nto those leaves which “follow the sun” during the day. Their specific\r\nconstitution is such that intense illumination is beneficial.\r\n\r\nThe leaf is adjusted as well as may be in different species of varying\r\nconstitution, and under different conditions, to a certain balance in\r\nits relation to the factors concerned. The problem then is to interpret\r\nfrom this point of view the positions and grouping of leaves. Because\r\nof the specific constitution of different plants, and because of a\r\ngreat variety of conditions in the environment, we see that it is a\r\nmore or less complex question.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 438. Sunflower with young head turned toward morning\r\nsun.]\r\n\r\n=769. Day and night positions contrasted.=—In many plants the\r\nday and night positions of the leaves are different. At night the\r\nleaves assume a position more or less vertical, known as the _profile_\r\nposition. This is generally regarded as a protective position, since\r\nduring the cool of the night the radiation of heat is less than if the\r\nleaf were in a vertical position. In many of these plants, however, the\r\nleaves in assuming the night position become closely appressed which\r\nwould also lessen the radiation. This peculiarity of leaves is largely\r\npossessed by the members of the family Leguminoseæ (clovers, peas,\r\nbeans, etc.), and by the sensitive plants.[45] But it is also shared by\r\nsome other plants as well (oxalis, for example). The leaves of these\r\nplants are usually provided with a mechanism which enables them to\r\nexecute these movements with ease. There is a cushion (_pulvinus_) of\r\ntissue at the base of the petiole, and in the case of compound leaves,\r\nat the base of the pinnæ and pinnules which undergoes changes in turgor\r\nin its cells. The collapsing of the cells by loss of water into the\r\nintercellular spaces causes the leaf to droop. When the cells regain\r\ntheir turgor by the absorption of the water from the intercellular\r\nspaces the leaf is raised to the horizontal, or day position. The light\r\nstimulus induces turgor of the pulvinus, the disappearance of the\r\nstimulus is accompanied by a loss of turgor. It is a remarkable fact\r\nthat in some sensitive plants, intense light stimuli are alarm signals\r\nwhich result in the same movement as if the light stimulus were\r\nentirely removed. As we know also contact or pressure stimulus, or\r\njarring produces the same result in “sensitive” plants like mimosa,\r\nsome species of rubus, etc. In many plants there is no well-developed\r\npulvinus, and yet the leaves show similar movements in assuming the\r\nday and night positions. Examples are seen in the sunflower, and in\r\nthe cotyledons of many plants. A little observation will enable any\r\none interested to discover some of these plants.[46] In these cases the\r\nnight position is due to epinastic growth, and while this influence is\r\nnot removed during the day the light stimulus overcomes it and the leaf\r\nis raised to the day position.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 439. Same sunflower plant photographed just at\r\nsundown.]\r\n\r\n=770. Leaves which rotate with the sun.=—During the growth period\r\nthe leaves of the sunflower as well as the growing end of the stem\r\nrespond readily to the direct sunlight. The response is so complete\r\nthat during sunny days the leaves toward the growing end of the stem\r\nare drawn close together in the form of a rosette and the entire\r\nrosette as well as the end of the stem are turned so that they face the\r\nsun directly. In the morning under the stimulus of the rising sun the\r\nrosette is formed and faces the east. All through the day, if the sun\r\ncontinues to shine, the leaves follow it, and at sundown the rosette\r\nfaces squarely the western horizon. For a week or more the young\r\nsunflower head will also face the sun directly and follow it all day as\r\nsurely as the rosette of leaves. At length, a little while before the\r\nflowers in the head blossom, the head ceases to turn, but the rosette\r\nof leaves and the stem also, to some extent, continue to turn with the\r\nsun. When the leaves become mature they also cease to turn. This is\r\nwell shown in all three photographs (figs. 438-439). The lower leaves\r\non the stem being older have assumed the fixed horizontal position\r\nusually characteristic of the plant with cylindrical habit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 440. Same plant a little older when the head does\r\nnot turn, but the stem and leaves do.]\r\n\r\nIt is not true, as is commonly supposed, that the fully opened\r\nsunflower head turns with the sun. But I have observed young heads\r\nfour or five inches in diameter rotate with the sun all day. This is\r\nbecause the growing end of the stem as well as the young head responds\r\nto the light stimulus. So there is some truth as well as a great deal\r\nof fiction in the popular belief that the sunflower head follows the\r\nsun. The young head will follow the sun all day even if all the leaves\r\nare cut off, and the growing stem will also if all the leaves as well\r\nas the flower head are cut away. Young seedlings will also turn even if\r\nthe cotyledons and plumule are cut off.\r\n\r\nThis phenomenon of the rotation of leaves with the sun is much more\r\ngeneral than one would infer, as may be seen from a little careful\r\nobservation of rapidly growing plants on bright sunny days. In Alabama\r\nI have observed beautiful rosettes of _Cassia marilandica_ rotate with\r\nthe sun all day. The peculiarity is very striking in the cotton plant,\r\nespecially when the rows extend north and south. In the forenoon or\r\nafternoon it is most striking as the entire row shows the leaves tilted\r\nup facing the sun. There are many of our weeds and common flowers of\r\nfield and garden which show this rotation of the leaves. Some of these\r\nform rotating rosettes; while in others the leaves rotate independently\r\nas in the sweet clover.\r\n\r\n=771. Fixed position of old leaves.=—In many of the cases cited\r\nin the preceding paragraph, the rotation of the leaf only occurs\r\non sunny days. During cloudy days the leaves of the sunflower, for\r\nexample, are in a nearly horizontal position, or the lower ones may\r\nbe somewhat oblique, since the stronger illumination on such a plant\r\nwould be the oblique rays rather than the zenith rays. As the leaves\r\nreach maturity also the epinastic growth is equalized by hyponastic\r\ngrowth so that the growth movements bring the leaf to stand in a nearly\r\nhorizontal position, or that position in which it receives the best\r\nillumination. In age, then, many leaves have a fixed position and this\r\ncorresponds with the position assumed on cloudy days.\r\n\r\n=772. Position on horizontal stems.=—On horizontal stems the\r\nleaves have a horizontal position, and if such a stem is stood in an\r\nerect position the appearance is very odd. If the leaf arises directly\r\nfrom the horizontal stem, its petiole will be twisted part way around\r\nin order to bring the face of the leaf uppermost. It is interesting\r\nto observe the different relation of stem, petiole and blade and the\r\namount of twisting as the horizontal stem or vine trails over\r\nirregularities in the surface, or climbs over and through other\r\nvegetation.\r\n\r\n=773. Position of leaflets on divided leaves.=—An interesting\r\ncomparison can be made with entire, lobed, divided and dissected\r\nleaves. The entire leaf usually lies in one plane, since usually the\r\nproblem of adjustment is the same for the entire surface. So the lobes\r\nof a leaf usually lie all in the same plane as they would if the leaf\r\nwere entire. We find the same is true usually of the compound leaf.\r\nIt forms an incomplete mosaic. Some of the pieces having been removed\r\nallow much of the light to pass through to leaves beneath. Leaves,\r\nespecially those of some size rarely lie in a flat plane. Some are more\r\nor less depressed. Some curve downward. Compound leaves often curve\r\nmore or less and the leaflets often droop more or less in a graceful\r\nfashion. It is interesting, however, that these far separated leaflets\r\nall lie in the same general plane. This is because the area of the\r\nleaf, if not too large, makes the problem of position with reference\r\nto light much the same as if the leaf were entire. The leaflets or\r\ndivisions, though separated, are laminate, and they can work more\r\nefficiently facing the light. But suppose we extend our observation to\r\nthe finely dissected capillary leaves of some of the parsley family\r\n(Umbelliferæ), or to the upper leaves of the fennel-leaved thoroughwort\r\n(Eupatorium fœniculaceum) among the aerial plants, and to Myriophyllum\r\namong the aquatic plants. The divisions are thread-like or cylindrical.\r\nOne side of the leaflet is just as efficient when presented to the\r\nlight as another. As a result the leaflets are not arranged in the same\r\nplane, but stand out in many directions.\r\n\r\nOccasionally one finds a divided or compound leaf in such a position\r\nthat one portion, because of being shaded above, receives the stronger\r\nlight stimulus from the side, while the other portion is lighted from\r\nabove. If this relation continues throughout the growth-period of the\r\nleaf the leaflets of one portion may lie in a different plane from\r\nthose of the other portion. In such cases, some of the leaflets are\r\npermanently twisted to bring them into their proper light relation.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. Leaf Patterns.\r\n\r\nMOSAICS, OR CLOSE PATTERNS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 441. Fittonia showing leaves arranged to form\r\ncompact mosaic. The netted venation of the leaf is very distinctly\r\nshown in this plant. (Photo by the Author.)]\r\n\r\n=774.= Where the leaves of a plant, or a portion of a plant, are\r\napproximate and arranged in the form of a pattern, the leaves fitting\r\ntogether to form a more or less even and continuous surface, such\r\npatterns are sometimes termed “mosaics,” since the relation of leaves\r\nto one another is roughly like the relation of the pieces of a mosaic.\r\nA good illustration of a mosaic is presented by a greenhouse plant\r\nFittonia (fig. 441). The stems are prostrate and the erect branches\r\nquite short, but it may have quite a wide system by the spreading of\r\nthe runners; the branches of such a length that the leaves borne near\r\nthe tips all fit together forming a broad surface of leaves so closely\r\nfitted together often that the stems cannot be seen. The advantage of\r\na mosaic over a separate disposition of leaves at somewhat different\r\nlevels is that the leaves do not shade one another. Were all the light\r\nrays coming down at right angles to the leaves, there would not be\r\nany shading of the lower ones, but the oblique rays of light would be\r\ncut off from many of the leaves. In the case of a mosaic all the rays\r\nof light play upon all the leaves. Some of the mosaics which can be\r\nobserved are as follows:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 442. Rosette pattern of leaves.]\r\n\r\n=775. Rosette pattern.=—The rosette pattern is presented by\r\nmany plants with “radial” leaves, or leaves which arise in a cluster\r\nnear the surface of the ground, and are thus more or less crowded in\r\ntheir arrangement on the stem. The pretty gloxinia often presents fine\r\nexamples of a loose rosette. In the rosette pattern the petioles of\r\nthe lower leaves are longer than the upper ones, and the blade is thus\r\ncarried out beyond the inner leaves. The leaves being so crowded in\r\ntheir attachment to the stem lie very nearly in the same plane.\r\n\r\n=776. Vines and climbers.=—Some of the most extensive mosaic\r\npatterns are shown in creeping and climbing vines. A very common\r\nexample is that of the ivies trained on the walls of buildings,\r\ncovering in some instances many square yards of surface. Where the\r\nvines trail over the ground or clamber over other vegetation, it is\r\ninteresting to observe the various patterns, and the distortion of\r\npetioles brought about by turning of the leaves. Of examples found in\r\ngreenhouses, the Pellonia is excellent, and the trailing ribbon-grass\r\noften forms loose mosaics.\r\n\r\n=777. Branch patterns.=—These patterns are very common. They\r\nare often formed in the woods on the ends of branches by the leaves\r\nadjusting themselves so as to largely avoid shading each other. Figure\r\n443 illustrates one of them from a maple branch. It is interesting to\r\nnote the way in which the leaves fit themselves in the pattern, how in\r\nsome the petioles have elongated, while others have remained short. Of\r\ncourse, it should be understood that the pattern is made during the\r\ngrowth of the leaves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 443. Spray of leaves of striped maple, showing\r\ndifferent lengths of leafstalks.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 444. Cedar of Lebanon, strong light only from one\r\nside of tree (Syria).]\r\n\r\n=778. The tree pattern.=—Mosaics are often formed by the exterior\r\nfoliage on a tree, though they are rarely so regular as some of those\r\nmentioned above. Still it is common to see in some trees with drooping\r\nlimbs like the elm, beautiful and large mosaics. The weeping elm\r\nsometimes forms a very close and quite even pattern over the entire\r\nouter surface. In most trees the leaf arrangement is not such as to\r\nform large patterns, but is more or less open. While the conifers do\r\nnot form mosaics there are many interesting examples of grouping of\r\nfoliage on branch systems into broadly expanded areas, as seen in the\r\nbranches of white pine trees, especially in the edge of a wood, or as\r\nseen in the arbor-vitæ.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER PATTERNS.\r\n\r\n=779. Imbricate pattern of short stems.=—This pattern is quite\r\ncommon, and differs from the rosette in that the leaves are distributed\r\nfurther apart on the stem so that the central ones are considerably\r\nhigher up than in the mosaic. The lower petioles are longer, as in\r\nthe rosette, so that the outer lower leaves extend further out. Some\r\nbegonias show fine imbricate patterns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 445. Imbricate pattern of leaves; Begonia.]\r\n\r\n=780. Spiral patterns.=—They are very common on stems of the\r\ncylindrical type, which are unbranched, or but little branched. The\r\nsunflower, mullein, chrysanthemum, as it is grown in greenhouses, the\r\nEaster lily, etc., are examples. The spiral arrangement of the leaves\r\nprovides that each successive leaf on the stem, as one ascends the\r\nstem, is a little to one side so that it does not cast shade on the leaf\r\njust below. In some stems, according to the leaf arrangement (or\r\nphyllotaxy), one would pass several times around in ascending the stem\r\nbefore a leaf would be found directly above another, which would be\r\nsuch a distance below that it would not be shaded to an appreciable\r\nextent. Interesting observations can be made on different plants to\r\nwork out the relation of distance of leaves on the stem to length of\r\nthe upper and lower leaves; the number of vertical rows on the stem\r\ncompared to the width of the leaves; and the relation of these facts to\r\nthe problem of light supply. Related to the spiral pattern is that of\r\nerect stems with opposite leaves. Here each pair is set at right angles\r\nto the direction of the pair above or below.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 446. Palm showing radiate arrangement of leaves and\r\nthe petiole of the leaf functions as stem in lifting leaf to the light.]\r\n\r\n=781. Radiate pattern.=—This pattern is present in many grasses\r\nand related plants with narrow leaves and short stems. The leaves are\r\noften very crowded at the base, but by radiating in all directions from\r\nthe horizontal to the vertical, abundant exposure to light is gained\r\nwith little shading. The dragon tree screw-pine, and plants grown in\r\ngreenhouses also illustrate this type. It is also shown in cycads,\r\npalms, and many ferns, although these have divided leaves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 447. Screw-pine (Pandanus) showing prop roots and\r\nradiate pattern of leaves.]\r\n\r\n=782. Compass plants.=—These plants with vertical leaf\r\narrangement, and exposure of both surfaces to the lateral rays of light\r\nhave been mentioned in other sections (Lactuca scariola).\r\n\r\n=783. Open patterns.=—Open patterns are presented by divided or\r\n“branched” leaves. Where the leaves are very finely dissected, they may\r\nbe clustered in great profusion and yet admit sufficient light for some\r\ndepth below. Where the leaflets are broader, the leaves are likely to\r\nbe fewer in number and so arranged as to admit light to a great depth\r\nso that successive leaves below on the same or adjacent stems may not\r\nbe too much shaded. On such plants, often the leaves lying next the\r\nground are entire or less divided.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[44] Some of the different terms used to express the kinds of compound\r\nleaves are as follows:\r\n\r\n[45] The most remarkable case is that of the “telegraph” plant\r\n(Desmodium gyrans). Aside from the day and night positions which the\r\nleaves assume, there is a pair of small lateral leaflets to each leaf\r\nwhich constantly execute a jerky motion, and swing around in a circle\r\nlike the second hand of a watch.\r\n\r\n[46] Seedlings are usually very sensitive to light and are good objects\r\nto study.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\n\r\nTHE ROOT.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Function of Roots.\r\n\r\n=784.= The most obvious function of the roots of ordinary\r\nplants are two: 1st, To furnish anchorage and partial support, and\r\n2d, absorption of liquid nutriment from the soil. The environmental\r\nrelation of such roots, then, in broad terms, is with the soil. It is\r\nvery clear that in some plants the root serves both functions, while in\r\nother plants the root may fulfil only one of these requirements.\r\n\r\nThe problems which the plant has to solve in working out these\r\nrelations are:\r\n\r\n    (1) Permeation of the soil or substratum.\r\n    (2) Grappling the substratum.\r\n    (3) A congenial moisture or water relation.\r\n    (4) Distribution of roots for the purpose of reaching\r\n          food-laden soil.\r\n    (5) Exposure of surface for absorption.\r\n    (6) The renewal of the delicate structures for absorption.\r\n    (7) Aid in preparation of food from raw material.\r\n    (8) The maintenance of the required balance between the\r\n          environment as a whole and the increasing or changing\r\n          requirements of the plant.\r\n\r\n=785.= (1) =Permeation of the soil or substratum.=—The\r\nfundamental divergence of character in the environmental relations of\r\nroot and stem are manifest as soon as they emerge from the germinating\r\nseed. Under the influence of the same stimulus (_gravity_) the root\r\nshows its geotropic character by growing downward, while the geotropic\r\ncharacter of the stem is shown in its upward growth.\r\n\r\nThe medium which the root has to penetrate offers considerable\r\nresistance, and the form of the root as well as its manner of growth is\r\nadapted to overcome this difficulty. The slender, conical, penetrating\r\nroot-tip wedges its way between the minute particles of soil or into\r\nthe minute crevices of the rock, while the nutation of the root enables\r\nit to search for the points of least resistance. The root-tips having\r\npenetrated the soil, the older portions of the root continue this wedge\r\naction by growth in diameter, though, of course, elongation of the old\r\nparts of the root does not take place. It is the widening growth of the\r\ntapering root that produces the wedge-like action. The crevices of the\r\nrock are sometimes broadened, but the resistance here is so great, the\r\nroot is often greatly flattened out.\r\n\r\n=786.= (2) =Grappling the substratum.=—The mere penetration\r\nof a single root into the soil gives it some hold on the soil and it\r\noffers some resistance to a “pull” since it has wedged its way in\r\nand the contact of soil particles offers resistance. The root hairs\r\nformed on the first entering root growing laterally in great numbers\r\nand applying themselves very closely to the soil particles, increase\r\ngreatly the hold of the plant on the soil, as one can readily see by\r\npulling up a young seedling. Lateral roots are soon formed, and as\r\nthese continue to extend and ramify in all directions, the hold is\r\nincreased until in the case of some of the larger plants the resistance\r\ntheir hold would offer would equal many tons. Even in some of the\r\nsmaller shrubs and herbs the resistance is considerable, as one can\r\neasily test by pulling with the hand. To obtain some idea of the amount\r\nof resistance the roots of these smaller plants offer, they can be\r\ntested by pulling with the ordinary spring scales.\r\n\r\n=787.= (3) =A congenial moisture, or water relation.=—In\r\ngeneral, the roots seek those portions of the soil provided with a\r\nmodicum of moisture. Usually a suitable moisture condition is present\r\nin those portions of the soil containing the plant food. But if\r\nportions of the soil are too dry and very nearby other portions\r\ncontaining moisture, the roots grow mainly into the moist substratum\r\n(_hydrotropism_). If the soil is too wet, the roots grow away from it\r\nto soil with less water, or in some cases will grow to and upon the\r\nsurface of the soil.\r\n\r\nThe roots need _aeration_, and where the supply of water is too great,\r\nthe air is shut out, and we know that corn, wheat, and many other\r\nplants become “sickly” in low and undrained soil in wet seasons. This\r\ncan only be said in the case of our ordinary dry land plants, i.e.,\r\nthose that occupy an intermediate position between _water-loving_\r\nplants and _dry-conditioned_ plants. This phase of the subject must be\r\nreserved for special treatment. (See Chapter XLVI.)\r\n\r\n=788.= (4) =Distribution of roots for the purpose of reaching\r\nfood-laden soil.=—This is one of the essential relations of the\r\nroot in the case of the land plant, and probably accounts for the very\r\nextensive ramification of the roots. To some extent it also explains\r\nthe different root systems in some plants. The pines, spruces, etc.,\r\nusually grow in regions where the soil is very shallow. The root\r\nsystem does not extend deeply into the soil. It spreads laterally and\r\nextends widely through the shallow surface soil and presents a very\r\ndifferent aspect from the stem system in the air. The root system of\r\nthe broad-leaved trees usually extends more deeply into the soil, while\r\nof course, extending laterally to great distances. The hickory, walnut,\r\netc., especially have strong tap-roots which extend deeply into the\r\nsoil, and the root system of such a tree is more comparable in aspect,\r\nif it were entirely uncovered, to the stem system in the air. The\r\ntap-root is more pronounced in some trees than in others. It may be\r\nthat in the hickory and walnut the deep tap-root is important in\r\nsupplying the tree with water in dry seasons, especially when growing\r\non dry, gravelly soil which does not retain moisture on the surface\r\nnor hold it within two or three feet of the surface. Experiment has\r\ndemonstrated, by pot culture of plants, that where soil rich in plant\r\nfood lies adjacent to poor soil, no matter in what part of the pot the\r\nrich soil is, the greatest growth and branching of roots is in the rich\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\n=789.= (5) =Exposure of root surface for absorption.=—The\r\nprincipal part of root absorption takes place in the young root and\r\nthe root hairs growing near the root-tip. The root-tips and root hairs\r\nin their relation to the root systems on which they are borne are\r\nnot to be compared morphologically with the leaves and stem system.\r\nBut the root-tips and hairs are absorbing organs of the roots while\r\nthe main root system supports them, brings them into relation with\r\nthe soil and moisture, and conducts food and other substances to and\r\nfrom them. One of the important relations of the leaf is that of\r\nlight, and since the source of light is restricted, i.e., it is not\r\nequally strong from all sides, an expanded and thin leaf-blade is more\r\neffective than an equal expenditure of plant material in the form of\r\nthread-like outgrowths. It is different, however, with the plant food\r\ndissolved in the soil water. It is equally accessible on all sides. A\r\ngreater surface for absorption is exposed with the same expenditure of\r\nmaterial by multiplication of the organs and a reduction in their size.\r\nNumerous delicate root hairs present a greater absorbing surface than\r\nif the same amount of material were massed into leaf-like expansions.\r\nThere is another important advantage also. Its slender roots and\r\nthread-like root hairs allow greater freedom of circulation of water,\r\nfood solutions, and air than if the absorbing organs of the roots were\r\nbroadly expanded.\r\n\r\n=790.= (6) =The renewal of the delicate structures for\r\nabsorption.=—The delicate root hairs are easily injured. The thin\r\ncell-walls through which food solutions flow become more or less choked\r\nby the gradual deposit of substances in solution in the water, and\r\ncontinued growth of the root in diameter forms a firmer epidermis and\r\ncortex through which the solutions taken up by the root hairs would\r\npass with difficulty. For this reason new root hairs are constantly\r\nbeing formed on the growing root-tip throughout the growing season,\r\nand in the case of perennial plants, through each season of their\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\n=791.= (7) =Aid in preparation of food from raw\r\nmaterials.=—For most plants the food obtained from the soil is\r\nalready in solution in the soil water. But there are certain substances\r\n(examples, some of the chemical compounds of potash, phosphoric acid,\r\netc.) which are insoluble in water. Certain acids excreted by the\r\nroots aid in making these substances soluble (see Chapter III). In\r\na number of plants the roots have become associated with fungus or\r\nbacterial organisms which assist in the manufacture of nitrogenous food\r\nsubstances, or even in the absorption of ordinary food solution from\r\nthe soil, or in making use of the decaying humus of the forest (see\r\nChapter IX).\r\n\r\n=792.= (8) =The maintenance of the required balance between\r\nthe environment and the increasing or changing requirements of the\r\nplant.=—In this matter the entire plant participates. Mention is\r\nmade here only of the general relation which the root sustains to its\r\nown environment and the increased burden placed upon it by the shoot.\r\nThe increase in the root system keeps pace with the increasing size of\r\nthe stem system. The roots become stronger, their ramifications wider,\r\nand the number of absorbing rootlets more numerous. The observation\r\nis sometimes offered that the correlation between the root system of\r\na plant, and the form of the stem system and position of the leaves,\r\nis of such a nature that plants with a tap-root system have their\r\nleaves so arranged as to shed the water to the center of the system,\r\nwhile plants with a fibrous-root system have their leaves so arranged\r\nas to shed the water outward. In support of this attention is called\r\nto the radiate type of the leaf system of the dandelion, beet, etc.\r\nIn the second place the imbricate type as manifested in broad-leaved\r\ntrees, and in the overlapping branch systems of many pines, etc. One\r\nshould note, however, that in the former class the leaves are often\r\narranged to shed as much water outward as inward. As to the latter\r\nclass, there is need of experiment to determine whether these empirical\r\nobservations are correct, for the following reasons: 1st, Root and leaf\r\ndistribution are governed by other and more important laws, the root\r\nbeing influenced by the location of food in the soil which usually\r\nforms a very thin stratum while the shoot and leaf is mainly influenced\r\nby light, and root distribution is much wider in a lateral direction\r\nthan that of the branches. 2d, In light rains the leaf surface holds\r\nback practically all the rain which is then evaporated into the air\r\nand lost to the root systems. 3d, In heavy and long-continued rains\r\nthe water breaks through the leaf system to such an extent that roots\r\nunder the tree would be as well supplied as those outside, and the\r\nground outside being saturated anyway, the roots do not need the\r\nsmall additional water which may have been shed outward. 4th, It is\r\nthe habit of plants where left undisturbed (except in rare cases), to\r\ngrow in more or less dense formations or societies. Here there is no\r\nopportunity for any appreciable centrifugal distribution of rainfall\r\nand yet the root distribution is practically the same, except that the\r\nroot systems of adjacent plants are interlaced.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Kinds of Roots.\r\n\r\n=793. The root system.=—From the foregoing, it will be understood\r\nthat the roots of a plant taken together form the _root system_ of that\r\nplant. In soil-roots in general we usually recognize two kinds of root\r\nsystems.\r\n\r\n=794. The fibrous-root system.=—Roots which are composed of\r\nnumerous slender branching roots resembling “fibers,” are termed\r\n_fibrous_, or the plant is said to have a _fibrous-root system_. The\r\nbean, corn, most grasses, and many other plants have fibrous-root\r\nsystems.\r\n\r\n=795. The tap-root system.=—Plants with a recognizable central\r\nshaft-like root, more or less thickened and considerably stouter\r\nthan the lateral roots, are said to have _tap_ roots, or they have a\r\n_tap-root system_. The dandelion, beet, carrot (see crown tuber) are\r\nexamples. The hickory, walnut, and some other trees have very prominent\r\ntap-roots when young. The tap-root is maintained in old age, but the\r\nlateral roots often become finally as large as the tap-root. Besides\r\ntap-roots and fibrous-roots, which include the larger number, several\r\nother kinds of roots are to be enumerated.\r\n\r\n=796. Aerial roots.=—Aerial roots are most abundantly developed\r\nin certain tropical plants, especially in the orchids and aroids. Many\r\nexamples of these plants are grown in conservatories. The amount of\r\nmoisture is so great in these tropical regions that the roots are\r\nabundantly supplied without the soil relation. Certain of the roots\r\nhang free in the air and are provided with a special sheath of spongy\r\ntissue called the _velamen_, through which moisture is absorbed from\r\nthe air. Other roots attach themselves to the trunk or branches of\r\nthe tree on which the orchid is growing, and furnish the support to\r\nthe _epiphyte_, as such plants are often called. Among the tangle\r\nof these clinging roots falling leaves are caught. Here they decay\r\nand nourishing roots grow from the clinging roots into this mass\r\nof decaying leaves and supply some of the plant food. Aerial roots\r\nsometimes possess chlorophyll.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of plants, however, in temperate regions which\r\nhave aerial roots. These are chiefly used to give the stem support as\r\nit climbs on trees or on walls. They are sometimes called clinging\r\nroots. A common example is the climbing poison-ivy (Rhus radicans), the\r\ntrumpet creeper, etc. Such aerial roots are called _adventitious_ roots.\r\n\r\n=797. Bracing roots, or prop roots.=—These are developed in a\r\ngreat variety of plants and serve to brace or prop the plant where\r\nthe fibrous-root system is insufficient to support the heavy shoot\r\nsystem, or the shoot system branches so widely props are needed to hold\r\nup the branches. In the common Indian corn several whorls of bracing\r\nroots arise from the nodes near the ground and extend outward and\r\ndownward to the ground, though the upper whorls do not always succeed\r\nin reaching the ground. The screw-pine so common in greenhouses affords\r\nan excellent example of prop roots. The roots are quite large, and long\r\nbefore the root reaches the soil the large root cap is evident. The\r\nbanyan tree of India is a classic example of prop roots for supporting\r\nthe wide-reaching branches. The mangrove in our own subtropical forests\r\nof Florida is a nearer example.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 448. Bracing roots of Indian corn.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 449. Buttresses of silk-cotton tree, Nassau.]\r\n\r\n=798. Buttresses= are formed at the junction of the root and\r\ntrunk, and therefore are part root and part stem. Splendid examples\r\nof buttresses are formed on the silk-cotton tree. They are sometimes\r\nformed on the elm and other trees in low swampy ground.\r\n\r\n=799. Fleshy roots, or root tubers.=—These are enlargements of\r\nthe root in the form of tubers, as in the sweet potato, the dahlia,\r\netc. They are storage reservoirs for food. Portions of the roots become\r\nthick and fleshy and contain large quantities of sugar, as in the sweet\r\npotato, or of _inulin_ (a carbohydrate) in the root tubers of the\r\ndahlia and other composites.\r\n\r\n=800. Water-roots and roots of water plants.=—These are roots\r\nwhich are developed in the water, or in the soil. Water-roots are\r\nsometimes formed on land plants where the root comes in contact with a\r\nbody of water, or a stream. Water-roots usually possess no root hairs,\r\nor but a few, as can be seen by comparing water-roots with soil-roots,\r\nor by comparing roots of plants grown in water cultures. The greater\r\nbody of water in contact with the root and the more delicate epidermis\r\nof the root render less necessary the root hairs. The duck-meats\r\n(Lemna) are good examples of plants having only water-roots. Other\r\naquatic plants like the potamogetons, etc., have true roots which grow\r\ninto the soil and serve to anchor the plant, but they are not developed\r\nas special organs of absorption, since the stem and leaves largely\r\nperform this function.\r\n\r\n=801. Holdfasts.=—These are organs for anchorage which are not\r\ntrue roots. These are especially well developed in some of the algæ\r\n(Fucus, Laminaria, etc.). They are usually called _holdfasts_. The\r\nholdfasts of the larger algæ are mainly for anchoring the plant. They\r\ndo not function as absorbing organs, and the structure is different\r\nfrom that of true roots.\r\n\r\n=802. Haustoria or suckers= is a name applied to another kind of\r\nholdfast employed by parasitic plants. In the dodder the haustorium\r\npenetrates the tissue of the _host_ (the plant on which the parasite\r\ngrows), and besides furnishing a means of attachment, it serves as an\r\nabsorbing organ by means of which the parasite absorbs food from its\r\nhost. The parasitic fungi like the powdery mildews which grow on the\r\nsurface of their hosts have simple haustoria which serve both as organs\r\nof attachment and absorption, while in the rusts which grow in the\r\ninterior of their hosts the haustoria are merely absorbing organs.\r\n\r\n=803. Rootlets, or rhizoids.=—Many of the algæ, liverworts and\r\nmosses have slender, hair-like organs of attachment and absorption.\r\nThese plants do not have true roots. Because of the slender form and\r\nsmall size of these organs, they are called _rhizoids_, or _rootlets_.\r\nIn form many of them resemble the root hairs of higher plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\n\r\nTHE FLORAL SHOOT.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. The Parts of the Flower.\r\n\r\nThe portion of the stem on which the flowers are borne is the _flower_\r\nshoot or axis, or taken together with the flowers, it is known as the\r\n_Flower Cluster_.\r\n\r\n=804. The flower.=—The flower is best understood by an\r\nexamination, first of one of the types known as a “complete” flower,\r\nas in the buttercup, the spring-beauty, the blood-root, the apple, the\r\nrose, etc.\r\n\r\nThere are two sets of organs or members in the complete flower—(1) the\r\nfloral envelope; (2) the essential or necessary members or organs.\r\n\r\nThe floral envelope when complete consists of—1st, an outer envelope,\r\nthe _calyx_, made up of several leaf-like structures (_sepals_), very\r\noften possessing chlorophyll, which envelop all the other parts of the\r\nflower when in bud; 2d, an inner envelope, the _corolla_, also made up\r\nof several leaf-like parts (_petals_), usually bright colored and larger\r\nthan the sepals. The outer and inner floral envelopes are usually in\r\nwhorls (though in close spirals in many of the buttercup family, etc.),\r\nand for reasons discussed elsewhere (Chapter XXXIV) represent leaves.\r\nThe essential or necessary members of the flower are also usually in\r\nwhorls and likewise represent leaves, but only in rare cases is there\r\nany suggestion, either in their form or color, of a leaf relationship.\r\nThese members are in two sets: (1) The outer, or _andrœcium_,\r\nconsisting of a few or many parts (_stamens_); (2) the inner set, the\r\n_gynœcium_, consisting of a few or many parts (_carpels_).\r\n\r\n=805. Purpose of the flower.=—While the ultimate purpose of\r\nall plants is the production of seed or its equivalent through\r\nwhich the plant gains distribution and perpetuation, the flower is\r\nthe specialized part of the seed plant which utilizes the food and\r\nenergies contributed by other members of the plant organization for the\r\nproduction of seed. In addition to this there are definite functions\r\nperformed by the members of the flower, which come under the general\r\nhead of plant work, or flower work.\r\n\r\n=806. The calyx, or the sepals.=—These are chiefly protective,\r\naffording protection to the young stamens and carpels in the flower\r\nbud. Where the corolla is absent, sepals are usually present and then\r\nassume the function of the petals. In a few instances the calyx may\r\npossibly ultimately join in the formation of the fruit (examples: the\r\nbutternut, walnut, hickory).\r\n\r\n=807. The corolla, or petals.=—The petals are partly protective\r\nin the bud, but their chief function where well developed seems to be\r\nthat of attracting insects, which through their visits to the flower\r\naid in “_pollination_,” especially “_cross pollination_.”\r\n\r\n=808. The stamens.=—The stamens (= microsporophylls) are\r\nflower organs for the production of _pollen_, or _pollen-spores_ (=\r\nmicrospores). The _stalk_ (not always present) is the _filament_, the\r\n_anther_ is borne on the filament when the latter is present. The\r\nanther consists of the _anther sacs_ or _pollen sacs_ (microsporangium)\r\ncontaining the pollen-spores, and the _connective_, the sterile tissue\r\nlying between and supporting the anther sac. The stamens are usually\r\nseparate, but sometimes they are united by their filaments, or by their\r\nanthers. When the pollen is ripe they open by slits or pores and the\r\npollen is scattered; or in rarer cases the pollen mass (_pollinium_) is\r\nremoved through the agency of insects (see Insect pollination, Chap.\r\nXLIII).\r\n\r\n=809. The pistil.=—The pistil consists of the “_ovary_,” the\r\n_style_ (not always present), and the _stigma_. These are well shown in\r\na _simple pistil_, common examples of which are found in the buttercup,\r\nmarsh marigold, the pea, bean, etc. The simple pistil is equivalent to\r\na _carpel_ (= macrosporophyll), while the _compound pistil_ consists of\r\ntwo or several carpels joined, as in the toothwort, trillium, lily,\r\netc. The _ovary_ is the enlarged part which below is attached to\r\nthe receptacle of the flower, and contains within the _ovules_. The\r\n_style_, when present, is a slender elongation of the upper end of\r\nthe ovary. The _stigma_ is supported on the end of the style when the\r\nlatter is present. It is often on a capitate enlargement of the style\r\nor extends down one side, or when the style is absent it is usually\r\nseated directly on the upper end of the ovary. The stigmatic surface is\r\nglutinous or “sticky,” and serves to hold the pollen-spores when they\r\ncome in contact with it.\r\n\r\nThe _ovules_ are within the ovary and are arranged in different ways\r\nin different plants. The pollen grain (or better pollen-spore =\r\nmicrospore), after it has been transferred to the stigma, “germinates,”\r\nand the pollen tube grows down through the tissue of the stigma and\r\nstyle, or courses down the stylar canal until it reaches the ovule.\r\nHere it usually enters the ovule (macrosporangium) at the _micropyle_\r\n(in some of the ament-bearing plants it enters at the _chalaza_), and\r\nthe sperm cells are emptied into the embryo sac in the interior of the\r\novule.\r\n\r\n=810. Fertilization.=—One of the sperms unites with the egg\r\nin the embryo sac. This is _fertilization_, and from the fertilized\r\negg the young embryo is formed still within the ovule. _Double\r\nfertilization_,—the other sperm cell sometimes unites with one or both\r\nof the “polar” nuclei which have united to form the “definitive” or\r\n“endosperm” nucleus. As a result of fertilization, the embryo plant is\r\nformed within the ovule, the coats of which enlarge by growth forming\r\nthe seed coats, and altogether forming the seed. (See Chapters XXXIV,\r\nXXXV, XXXVI.)\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Kinds of Flowers.\r\n\r\n=811. Absence of certain flower parts.=—The _complete_ flower\r\ncontains all the four series of parts. When any one of the series of\r\nparts is lacking, the flower is said to be _incomplete_. Where only one\r\nseries of the floral envelopes is present the flowers are said to be\r\n_apetalous_ (the petals are absent), examples: elm, buckwheat, etc.\r\nFlowers which lack both floral envelopes are _naked_. When pistils are\r\nabsent but stamens are present the flowers are _staminate_, whether\r\nfloral envelopes are present or not; and so when stamens are absent and\r\npistils present the flower is _pistillate_. If both stamens and pistils\r\nare absent the flower is said to be _sterile_ or _neutral_ (snowball,\r\nmarginal or showy flowers in hydrangea). Flowers with both stamens and\r\npistils, whether or not they have floral envelopes, are _perfect_ (or\r\nhermaphrodite), so if only one of these sets of _essential organs_\r\nof the flower is present the flower is _imperfect_, or _diclinous_.\r\nSometimes the imperfect, or diclinous, flowers are on the same plant,\r\nand the plant is said to be _monœcious_ (of one household). When\r\nstaminate flowers are on certain individual plants, and the pistillate\r\nflowers of the same species are on other individuals, the plant is\r\n_diœcious_ (or of two households). When some of the flowers of a plant\r\nare diclinous and others are perfect, they are said to be _polygamous_.\r\n\r\nMany of these variations relating to the presence or absence of flower\r\nparts in one way or another contribute to the well-being of the plant.\r\nSome indicate a division of labor; thus in the neutral flowers of\r\ncertain species of hydrangea or viburnum, the showy petals serve to\r\nattract insects which aid in the pollination of the fertile flowers. It\r\nmust not be understood, however, that all variations in plants which\r\nresults in new or different forms of flowers is for the good of the\r\nspecies. For example, under cultivation the flowers of viburnum and\r\nhydrangea sometimes are all neutral and showy. While such variations\r\nsometimes contribute to the happiness of man, the plant has lost the\r\npower of developing seed. In diclinous flowers cross pollination is\r\nnecessitated.\r\n\r\n=812. Form of the flower.=—The flower as a whole has _form_.\r\nThis is so characteristic that in general all flowers of the different\r\nindividuals of a species are of the same shape, though they may vary\r\nin size. In general, flowers of closely related plants of different\r\nspecies are of the same type as to form, so that often in the shape of\r\nthe flower alone we can see the relationship of kind, though the form\r\nof the flower is not the most important nor always the sure index of\r\nkinship. Since many flowers resemble certain familiar objects, names\r\nare often used which relate to these objects.\r\n\r\nFlowers are said to be _regular_, or _irregular_. In a regular flower\r\nall of the parts of a set or series are of the same shape and size,\r\nwhile in irregular flowers the parts are of a different shape or size\r\nin some of the sets. The flowers of the pea family (_Papilionaceæ_),\r\nof the mint family (_Labiatæ_), of the morning glory, larkspur,\r\nmonkshood, etc., are irregular (fig. 450). The corolla usually gives\r\nthe characteristic form to the flower, and the name is usually applied\r\nto the form of the corolla.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 450. Several forms of flowers. Regular flowers.\r\n_wh_, wheel-shaped corolla; _sa_, salver-shaped; _tub_, tubular-shaped.\r\nIrregular flowers. _pa_, butterfly or papilionaceous; _per_, personate\r\nor masked flower; _lab_, gaping or ringent corolla. The two latter are\r\ncalled bilabiate flowers.]\r\n\r\nSome of the different forms are wheel-shaped or _rotate_ corolla when\r\nthe petals spread out at once like the spokes of a wheel, as in the\r\npotato, tomato, or bittersweet; _salver-shaped_ when the petals spread\r\nout at right angles from the end of a corolla tube, as in the phlox;\r\n_bell-shaped_, or _campanulate_, as in the harebell or campanula;\r\n_funnel-shaped_, as in the morning glory; _tubular_, when the ends of\r\nthe petals spread but little or none from the end of the corolla tube,\r\nas in the turnip flower or in the disk florets of the composites. The\r\n_butterfly_, or _papilionaceous_ corolla is peculiar as in the pea\r\nor bean. The upper petal is the “banner,” the two lateral ones the\r\n“wings,” and the two lower the “keel.”\r\n\r\nThe _labiate_ corolla is characteristic of the mint family where the\r\ngamosepalous corolla is unequally divided, so that the two upper lobes\r\nare sharply separated from the three lower forming two “lips.” The\r\nlabiate corolla of the toad-flax, or snapdragon is _personate_, or\r\n_masked_, because the lower lip arches upward like a palate and closes\r\nthe entrance to the corolla tube; that of the dead nettle (_Lamium_) is\r\n_ringent_ or _gaping_, because the lips are spread wide apart. In some\r\nplants the labiate corolla is not very marked and differs but slightly\r\nfrom a regular form.\r\n\r\nThe _ligulate_ or _strap-shaped_ corolla is characteristic of the\r\nflowers of the dandelion or chicory, or of the ray flowers of other\r\ncomposites (fig. 451). The lower part of the gamosepalous corolla is\r\ntubular, and the upper part is strap-shaped, as if that part of the\r\ntube were split on one side and spread out flat.\r\n\r\nThese forms of the flower should be studied in appropriate examples.\r\n\r\n=813. Union of flower parts.=—In the buttercup flower all the\r\nparts of each series are separate from one another and from other\r\nseries of parts. Each one is attached to the _receptacle_ of the\r\nflower, which is a very much shortened portion of the flower axis.\r\nThe calyx being composed of separate and distinct parts is said to be\r\n_polysepalous_, and the corolla is likewise _polypetalous_. The stamens\r\nare _distinct_, and the pistils are _simple_. In many flowers, however,\r\nthere is a greater or lesser _union_ of parts.\r\n\r\n=814. Union of parts of the same series or cycle.=—The parts\r\n_coalesce_, either slightly or to a great extent. Usually they are not\r\nso completely coalesced but what the number of parts of the series can\r\nbe determined. Where the sepals are united the calyx is _gamosepalous_,\r\nwhen the petals are united the corolla is _gamopetalous_.\r\n\r\nUnion of the sepals or of the corolla is quite common, but union\r\nof the stamens is rare except in a few families where it is quite\r\ncharacteristic. When the stamens are united by their anthers, they\r\nare _syngenœsious_. This is the case in most flowers of the composite\r\nfamily. When all the stamens are united into one group by their\r\nfilaments, they are _monadelphous_ (one brotherhood), as in\r\nhollyhock, hibiscus, cotton, marsh-mallow, etc. When they are united\r\nby their filaments in two groups, they are _diadelphous_ (two\r\nbrotherhoods), as in the pea and most members of the pea family. In\r\nmost species of St. John’s wort (Hypericum), the stamens are united in\r\nthrees (_triadelphous_).\r\n\r\n=815. The carpels are often united.=—The pistil is then said to\r\nbe _compound_. Where the pistils are consolidated, usually the adjacent\r\nwalls coalesce and thus separate the cavity of each ovary. Each cavity\r\nin the compound pistil is a _locule_. In some cases the adjacent walls\r\ndisappear so that there is one common cavity for the compound pistil\r\n(examples: purslane, chickweeds, pinks, etc.). In a few cases there is a\r\nfalse partition (example, in the toothwort and other crucifers). The\r\ncompound pistil is very often lobed slightly, so that the different\r\npistils can be discerned. More often the styles or stigmas are\r\ndistinct, and thus indicate the number of pistils united.\r\n\r\n=816. Union of the parts of different series.=—While in the\r\nbuttercup and many other flowers, all the different parts are inserted\r\non the torus or receptacle, in other flowers one series of parts may\r\nbe joined to another. This is _adnation_ of parts, or the two or more\r\nseries are _adnate_. In the morning glory the stamens are inserted\r\non the inner face of the corolla tube; the same is true in the mint\r\nfamily, and there are many other examples. The insertion of parts,\r\nwhether free or adnate, is usually spoken of in reference to their\r\nrelation to the pistil. Thus, in the buttercup the floral envelopes and\r\nstamens are all free and _hypogynous_, they are _below_ the pistil.\r\nThe pistil in this case is _superior_. In the cherry, pear, etc., the\r\npetals and stamens are borne on the edge of the more or less elevated\r\ntube of the calyx, and are said to be _perigynous_, i.e., around the\r\npistil. In the cranberry, huckleberry, etc., the calyx is for the\r\nmost part united with the wall of the ovary with the short calyx\r\nlimbs projecting from the upper surface. The petals and stamens are\r\ninserted on the edge of the calyx above the ovary; they are, therefore,\r\n_epigynous_, and the ovary being under the calyx, as it were, is\r\n_inferior_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. Arrangement of Flowers, or Mode of Inflorescence.\r\n\r\n=817. Flowers are solitary or clustered.=—_Solitary flowers_\r\nare more simple in their arrangement, i.e., it is easier for us to\r\ndetermine and name their relation to each other and to other parts of\r\nthe plant. They are either _axillary_, i.e., on short lateral shoots\r\nin the axils of ordinary foliage leaves, or they are _terminal_, i.e.,\r\nthey are borne on the end of the main axis of an ordinary foliage\r\nshoot. In either case they are so far separated, and the foliage\r\nleaves are so prominent, they do not form recognizable groups or\r\nclusters. The manner of arrangement of flowers on the shoot is called\r\n_inflorescence_, while the group of flowers so arranged is the _flower\r\ncluster_.\r\n\r\nTwo different modes of inflorescence are usually recognized in\r\nthe arrangement of flowers on the stem. (1) The _corymbose_, or\r\n_indeterminate inflorescence_ (also indefinite inflorescence), in\r\nwhich the flowers arise from axillary buds, and the terminal bud may\r\ncontinue to grow. (2) The _cymose_ or _determinate inflorescence_ (also\r\n_definite inflorescence_) in which the flowers arise from terminal\r\nbuds. This arrests the growth of the shoot in length.\r\n\r\nThere are several advantages to the plant in the different modes of\r\ninflorescence, chief among which is the massing of the flowers, thus\r\nincreasing the chances for effective pollination.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. FLOWER CLUSTERS WITH INDETERMINATE INFLORESCENCE.\r\n\r\n=818. The simplest mode of indeterminate inflorescence= is where\r\nthe flowers arise in the axils of normal foliage leaves, while the\r\nterminal bud, as in the florist’s smilax, the bellwort, moneywort,\r\napricot, etc., continues to grow. The flowers are _solitary_ and\r\n_axillary_. In other cases which are far more numerous, the flowers are\r\nassociated into more or less definite clusters in which are a number\r\nof recognizable types. The word type used in this sense, it should be\r\nunderstood, does not refer to an original structure which is the\r\nsource of others. It merely refers to a mode of inflorescence which we\r\nattempt to recognize, and about which we group those forms which have\r\na resemblance to one another. There are many forms of flower clusters\r\nwhich do not conform to any one of our recognized types, and are very\r\npuzzling. The evolution of the flower clusters has been _natural_, and\r\nwe cannot make them all conform to an _artificial_ classification.\r\nThese _types_ are named merely as a matter of convenience in the\r\nexpression of our ideas. The types usually recognized are as follows:\r\n\r\n=819. The raceme.=—The flower-shoot is more or less elongated,\r\nand the leaves are reduced to a minute size termed _bracts_, while the\r\nflowers on lateral axes are solitary in the axils of the bracts. The\r\nreduction in the size of the leaves and the somewhat limited growth\r\nof the shoot in length, makes the flowers more prominent, and brings\r\nthem into closer relation than if they were formed in the axils of\r\nthe leaves on the ordinary foliage shoot. The choke cherry, currant,\r\npokeweed, sourwood, etc., are examples of a raceme (fig. 569). In most\r\nplants with the raceme type, while the inflorescence is indeterminate,\r\nand the uppermost flowers (those toward the end of the main shoot)\r\nare younger, still the period of flowering is somewhat restricted\r\nand the raceme stops growing. In a few plants, however, as in the\r\ncommon “shepherd’s-purse,” the raceme continues to grow throughout the\r\nsummer, so that the lower flowers may have ripened their seed while\r\nthe terminal portion of the raceme is still growing and producing\r\nnew flowers. Compound racemes are formed when by branching of the\r\nflower-shoot there are several racemes in a cluster, as in the false\r\nSolomon’s seal (Smilacina racemosa).\r\n\r\n=820. The panicle.=—The panicle is developed from the raceme type\r\nby the branching of the lateral flower-axes forming a loose open flower\r\ncluster, as in the _oat_.\r\n\r\n=821. The thyrsus= is a compact panicle of pyramidal form, as in\r\nthe lilac, horse-chestnut, etc.\r\n\r\n=822. The corymb.=—The corymb shows likewise an easy transition\r\nfrom the raceme type, by the shortening of the main axis of\r\ninflorescence, and the lengthening of the lower, lateral flower\r\npeduncles so that the flower cluster is more or less flattened on\r\ntop. This represents the _simple corymb_. A _compound corymb_ is one\r\nin which some of the flower peduncles branch again forming secondary\r\ncorymbs, as in the mountain-ash. It is like a panicle with the lower\r\nflower stalks elongated.\r\n\r\n=823. The umbel.=—The umbel is developed from the raceme, or\r\ncorymb. The main flower-shoot remains very short or undeveloped with\r\nseveral flowers on long peduncles arising close together around this\r\nshortened axis, in the form of a whorl or cluster. Examples are found\r\nin the milkweed, water pennywort (Hydrocotyle), the oxheart cherry,\r\netc. A _compound_ umbel is one in which the peduncles are branched,\r\nforming secondary umbels, as in the caraway, parsnip, carrot, etc.\r\n\r\n=824. The spike.=—In the spike the main axis is long, and the\r\nsolitary flowers in the axils of the bracts are usually sessile, and\r\noften very much crowded. The plaintain, mullein (fig. 422), etc.,\r\nare examples. The spike is a raceme, only the flowers are sessile\r\nand crowded. In the grasses the flower cluster is branched, and the\r\nbranchlets bearing a few flowers are spikelets.\r\n\r\n=825. The head.=—When the flower axis is very much shortened\r\nand the flowers crowded and sessile or nearly so, forming a globose\r\nor compressed cluster, it is a _head_ or _capitulum_. The transition\r\nis from a spike by the shortening of the main axis, as in the clover,\r\nbutton bush (_Cephalanthus_), etc., or in the shortening of the\r\npeduncles in an umbel, as in the daisy, dandelion, and other composite\r\nflowers. In these the head is surrounded by an involucre, which in\r\nthe young head often envelopes the mass of flowers, thus affording\r\nthem protection. In some other composites (Lactuca, for example) the\r\ninvolucre affords protection for a longer period, even while the seeds\r\nare ripening.\r\n\r\n=826. The spadix.=—When the main axis of the flower cluster is\r\nfleshy, the spike or head forms a _spadix_, as in the Indian turnip,\r\nthe skunk-cabbage, the calla, etc. The spadix is usually more or less\r\nenclosed in a _spathe_, a somewhat strap-shaped leaf.\r\n\r\n=827. The catkin.=—A spike which is usually caducous, i.e., falls\r\naway after the maturity of the flower or fruit, is called a catkin,\r\nor an _ament_. The flower clusters of the alder, willow, (fig. 555),\r\npoplar, and the staminate flower clusters of the oak, hickory,\r\nhazel, birch, etc., are _aments_. So characteristic is this mode\r\nof inflorescence that the plants are called _amentiferous_, or\r\n_amentaceous_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 451. Head of sunflower showing centripetal\r\ninflorescence of tubular flowers. (Photo by the Author.)]\r\n\r\n=828. Anthesis of flowers with indeterminate inflorescence.=—In\r\nthe anthesis of the raceme as well as in other corymbose forms the\r\nlower (or outer) flowers being older, open first. The opening of the\r\nflowers then takes place from below, upward; or from the outside,\r\ninward toward the center of inflorescence. The _anthesis_, i.e., the\r\nopening of the flowers of corymbose forms is said to be _centripetal_,\r\ni.e., it progresses from outside, inward. The anthesis of the fuller’s\r\nteazel is peculiar, since it shows both types. There are several\r\ndistinct advantages to the plant where anthesis extends over a period\r\nof time, as it favors cross pollination, favors the formation of seed\r\nin case conditions should be unfavorable at one period of anthesis,\r\ndistributes the drain on the plant for food, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 452. Heads of fuller’s teazel in different stages\r\nof flowering.]\r\n\r\n\r\nB. FLOWER CLUSTERS WITH DETERMINATE INFLORESCENCE.\r\n\r\n=829. The simplest mode of determinate inflorescence= is a plant\r\nwith a solitary terminal flower, as in the hepatica, the tulip,\r\netc. The leaves in these two plants are clustered in the form of a\r\nrosette, and the aerial shoot is naked and bears the single flower at\r\nits summit. Such a flower-shoot is a _scape_. As in the case of the\r\nindeterminate inflorescence, so here the larger number of flower-shoots\r\nare more complex and specialized, resulting in the evolution of flower\r\nclusters or masses. Accompanying the association of flowers into\r\nclusters there has been a reduction in leaf surface on the flower-shoot\r\nso that the flowers predominate in mass and are more conspicuous. Among\r\nthe recognized modes of determinate inflorescence, the following are\r\nthe chief ones:\r\n\r\n=830. The cyme.=—In the cyme the terminal flower on the main axis\r\nopens first and the remaining flowers are borne on lateral shoots,\r\nwhich arise from the axils of leaves or bracts, below. These lateral\r\nshoots usually branch and elongate so that the terminal flowers on all\r\nthe branches reach nearly the same height as the terminal flower on the\r\nmain shoot, forming a somewhat flattened or convex top of the flower\r\ncluster. This is illustrated in the basswood flower. The anthesis of\r\nthe cyme is _centrifugal_, i.e., from the inside outward to the margin.\r\nBut it is often more or less mixed, since the lateral shoots if they\r\nbear more than one flower are diminutive cymes and the terminal flower\r\nopens before the lateral ones. Where the flower cluster is quite large\r\nand the branching quite extensive, _compound cymes_ are formed, as in\r\nthe dogwood, hydrangea, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 453. Diagrams of cymose inflorescence. _A_,\r\ndichasium; _B_, scorpioid cyme; _C_, helicoid cyme. (After\r\nStrasburger.)]\r\n\r\n=831. The helicoid cyme.=—Where successive lateral branching\r\ntakes place, and always continues on the same side a curved flower\r\ncluster is formed, as in the forget-me-not and most members of the\r\nborage family. This is known as a _helicoid cyme_ (fig. 453, _C_). Each\r\nnew branch becomes in turn the “false” axis bearing a new branch on the\r\nsame side.\r\n\r\n=832. The scorpioid cyme.=—_A scorpioid cyme_ (fig. 453, _B_) is\r\nformed where each new branch arises on alternate sides of the “false”\r\naxis.\r\n\r\n=833. The forking cyme= is where each “false” axis produces two\r\nbranches opposite, so that it represents a false dichotomy (example,\r\nthe flower cluster of chickweed).\r\n\r\n=834.= Some of these flower clusters are peculiar and it is\r\ndifficult to see how the helicoid, or scorpioid, cymes are of any\r\nadvantage to the plant over a true cyme. The inflorescence of the\r\nplant being determinate, if the flowering is to be extended over a\r\nconsiderable period a peculiar form would necessarily result. In the\r\n_helicoid cyme_ continued branching takes place on one side, and\r\nthe result in the forget-me-not is a continued inflorescence in its\r\neffect like that of a continued raceme (compare shepherd’s-purse).\r\nBut we should not expect that all of the complex and specialized\r\nstructures from simple and generalized ones are beneficial to the\r\nplant. In many plants we recognize evolution in the direction of\r\nadvantageous structures. But since the plant cannot consciously\r\nevolve these structures, we must also recognize that there may be\r\nphases of retrogression in which the structures evolved are not so\r\nbeneficial to the plant as the more simple and generalized ones of its\r\nancestors. Variation and change do not result in advancing the plant\r\nor plant structures merely along the lines which will be beneficial.\r\nThe tendency is in all directions. The result in general may be\r\ndiagramed by a tree with divergent and wide-reaching branches. Some die\r\nout; others remain subordinate or dormant; while still others droop\r\ndownward, showing a retrogression. But in this backward evolution\r\nthey do not return to the condition of their ancestors, nor is the\r\nsame course retraced. A new downward course is followed just as the\r\ndownward-growing branch follows a course of its own, and does not\r\nreturn in the trunk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII.\r\n\r\nPOLLINATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrigin of heterospory, and the necessity for pollination.\r\n\r\n=835. Both kinds of sexual organs on the same prothallium.=—In\r\nthe ferns, as we have seen, the sexual organs are borne on the\r\nprothallium, a small, leaf-like, heart-shaped body growing in moist\r\nsituations. In a great many cases both kinds of sexual organs are\r\nborne on the same prothallium. While it is perhaps not uncommon, in\r\nsome species, that the egg-cell in an archegonium may be fertilized\r\nby a spermatozoid from an antheridium on the same prothallium, it\r\nhappens many times that it is fertilized by a spermatozoid from another\r\nprothallium. This may be accomplished in several ways. In the first\r\nplace antheridia are usually found much earlier on the prothallium than\r\nare the archegonia. When these antheridia are ripe, the spermatozoids\r\nescape before the archegonia on the same prothallium are mature.\r\n\r\n=836. Cross fertilization in monœcious prothallia.=—By swimming\r\nabout in the water or drops of moisture which are at times present in\r\nthese moist situations, these spermatozoids may reach and fertilize\r\nan egg which is ripe in an archegonium borne on another and older\r\nprothallium. In this way what is termed cross fertilization is brought\r\nabout nearly as effectually as if the prothallia were diœcious, i.e. if\r\nthe antheridia and archegonia were all borne on separate prothallia.\r\n\r\n=837. Tendency toward diœcious prothallia.=—In other cases\r\nsome fern prothallia bear chiefly archegonia, while others bear only\r\nantheridia. In these cases cross fertilization is enforced because\r\nof this separation of the sexual organs on different prothallia.\r\nThese different prothallia, the male and female, are largely due to a\r\ndifference in food supply, as has been clearly proven by experiment.\r\n\r\n=838. The two kinds of sexual organs on different prothallia.=—In\r\nthe horsetails (equisetum) the separation of the sexual organs on\r\ndifferent prothallia has become quite constant. Although all the spores\r\nare alike, so far as we can determine, some produce small male plants\r\nexclusively, while others produce large female plants, though in some\r\ncases the latter bear also antheridia. It has been found that when the\r\nspores are given but little nutriment they form male prothallia, and\r\nthe spores supplied with abundant nutriment form female prothallia.\r\n\r\n=839. Permanent separation of sexes by different amounts of nutriment\r\nsupplied the spores.=—This separation of the sexual organs of\r\ndifferent prothallia, which in most of the ferns, and in equisetum, is\r\ndependent on the chance supply of nutriment to the germinating spores,\r\nis made certain when we come to such plants as isoetes and selaginella.\r\nHere certain of the spores receive more nutriment while they are\r\nforming than others. In the large sporangia (macrosporangia) only a few\r\nof the cells of the spore-producing tissue form spores, the remaining\r\ncells being dissolved to nourish the growing macrospores, which are few\r\nin number. In the small sporangia (microsporangia) all the cells of the\r\nspore-producing tissue form spores. Consequently each one has a less\r\namount of nutriment, and it is very much smaller, a microspore. The\r\nsexual nature of the prothallium in selaginella and isoetes, then, is\r\npredetermined in the spores while they are forming on the sporophyte.\r\nThe microspores are to produce male prothallia, while the macrospores\r\nare to produce female prothallia.\r\n\r\n=840. Heterospory.=—This production of two kinds of spores\r\nby isoetes, selaginella, and some of the other fern plants is\r\n_heterospory_, or such plants are said to be _heterosporous_.\r\nHeterospory, then, so far as we know from living forms, has originated\r\nin the fern group. In all the higher plants, in the gymnosperms and\r\nangiosperms, it has been perpetuated, the microspores being represented\r\nby the pollen, while the macrospores are represented by the embryo sac;\r\nthe male organ of the gymnosperms and angiosperms being the antherid\r\ncell in the pollen or pollen tube, or in some cases perhaps the pollen\r\ngrain itself, and the female organ in the angiosperms perhaps reduced\r\nto the egg-cell of the embryo sac.\r\n\r\n=841. In the pteridophytes water serves as the medium for conveying\r\nthe sperm cell to the female organ.=—In the ferns and their allies,\r\nas well as in the liverworts and mosses, surface water is a necessary\r\nmedium through which the generative or sperm cell of the male organ,\r\nthe spermatozoid, may reach the germ cell of the female organ. The\r\nsperm cell is here motile. This is true in a large number of cases\r\nin the algæ, which are mostly aquatic plants, while in other cases\r\ncurrents of water float the sperm cell to the female organ.\r\n\r\n=842. In the higher plants a modification of the prothallium is\r\nnecessary.=—As we pass to the gymnosperms and angiosperms,\r\nhowever, where the primitive phase (the gametophyte) of the plants\r\nhas become dependent solely on the modern phase (the sporophyte) of\r\nthe plant, surface water no longer serves as the medium through which\r\na motile sperm cell reaches the egg-cell to fertilize it. The female\r\nprothallium, or macrospore, is, in nearly all cases, permanently\r\nenclosed within the sporangium, so that if there were motile sperm\r\ncells on the outside of the ovary, they could never reach the egg to\r\nfertilize it.\r\n\r\n=843.= But a modification of the microspore, the pollen tube,\r\nenables the sperm cell to reach the egg-cell. The tube grows through\r\nthe nucellus, or first through the tissues of the ovary, deriving\r\nnutriment therefrom.\r\n\r\n=844.= But here an important consideration should not escape us.\r\nThe pollen grains (microspores) must in nearly all cases first reach\r\nthe pistil, in order that in the growth of this tube a channel may be\r\nformed through which the generative cell can make its way to the egg\r\ncell. The pollen passes from the anther locule, then, to the stigma of\r\nthe ovary. This process is termed _pollination_.\r\n\r\n\r\nPollination.\r\n\r\n=845. Self pollination, or close pollination.=—Perhaps very few\r\nof the admirers of the pretty blue violet have ever noticed that there\r\nare other flowers than those which appeal to us through the beautiful\r\ncolors of the petals. How many have observed that the brightly colored\r\nflowers of the blue violet rarely “set fruit”? Underneath the soil\r\nor débris at the foot of the plant are smaller flowers on shorter,\r\ncurved stalks, which do not open. When the anthers dehisce, they are\r\nlying close upon the stigma of the ovary, and the pollen is deposited\r\ndirectly upon the stigma of the same flower. This method of pollination\r\nis _self pollination_, or _close pollination_. These small, closed\r\nflowers of the violet have been termed “_cleistogamous_,” because they\r\nare pollinated while the flower is closed, and fertilization takes\r\nplace as a result.\r\n\r\nBut self pollination takes place in the case of some open flowers.\r\nIn some cases it takes place by chance, and in other cases by such\r\nmovements of the stamens, or of the flower at the time of the\r\ndehiscence of the pollen, that it is quite certainly deposited upon the\r\nstigma of the same flower.\r\n\r\n=846. Wind pollination.=—The pine is an example of\r\nwind-pollinated flowers. Since the pollen floats in the air or\r\nis carried by the “wind,” such flowers are _anemophilous_. Other\r\nanemophilous flowers are found in other conifers, in grasses, sedges,\r\nmany of the ament-bearing trees, and other dicotyledons. Such plants\r\nproduce an abundance of pollen and always in the form of “dust,” so\r\nthat the particles readily separate and are borne on the wind.\r\n\r\n=847. Pollination by insects.=—A large number of the plants which\r\nwe have noted as being anemophilous are monœcious or diœcious, i.e. the\r\nstamens and pistils are borne in separate flowers. The two kinds of\r\nflowers thus formed, the male and the female, are borne either on the\r\nsame individual (monœcious) or on different individuals (diœcious). In\r\nsuch cases cross pollination, i.e. the pollination of the pistil of\r\none flower by pollen from another, is sure to take place, if it is\r\npollinated at all. Even in monœcious plants cross pollination often\r\ntakes place between flowers of different individuals, so that more\r\nwidely different stocks are united in the fertilized egg, and the\r\nstrain is kept more vigorous than if very close or identical strains\r\nwere united.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 454. Viola cucullata; blue flowers above,\r\ncleistogamous flowers smaller and curved below. Section of pistil at\r\nright.]\r\n\r\n=848.= But there are many flowers in which both stamens and\r\npistils are present, and yet in which cross pollination is accomplished\r\nthrough the agency of insects.\r\n\r\n=859. Pollination of the bluet.=—In the pretty bluet the stamens\r\nand styles of the flowers are of different length as shown in figures\r\n455, 456. The stamens of the long-styled flower are at about the same\r\nlevel as the stigma of the short-styled flower, while the stamens of\r\nthe latter are on about the same level as the stigma of the former.\r\nWhat does this interesting relation of the stamens and pistils in the\r\ntwo different flowers mean? As the butterfly thrusts its “tongue” down\r\ninto the tube of the long-styled flower for the nectar, some of the\r\npollen will be rubbed off and adhere to it. When now the butterfly\r\nvisits a short-styled flower this pollen will be in the right position\r\nto be rubbed off onto the stigma of the short style. The positions\r\nof the long stamens and long style are such that a similar cross\r\npollination will be effected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 455. Dichogamous flower of the bluet (Houstonia\r\ncœrulea), the long-styled form.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 456. Dichogamous flower of bluet (Houstonia\r\ncœrulea), the short-styled form.]\r\n\r\n=850. Pollination of the primrose.=—In the primroses, of which\r\nwe have examples growing in conservatories, that blossom during the\r\nwinter, we have almost identical examples of the beautiful adaptations\r\nfor cross pollination by insects found in the bluet. The general shape\r\nof the corolla is the same, but the parts of the flower are in\r\nfives, instead of in fours as in the bluet. While the pollen of the\r\nshort-styled primulas sometimes must fall on the stigma of the same\r\nflower, Darwin has found that such pollen is not so potent on the\r\nstigma of its own flower as on that of another, an additional provision\r\nwhich tends to necessitate cross pollination.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 457. Dichogamous flowers of primula.]\r\n\r\nIn the case of some varieties of pear trees, as the Bartlett, it\r\nhas been found that the flowers remain largely sterile not only to\r\ntheir own pollen, or pollen of the flowers on the same tree, but to\r\nall flowers of that variety. However, they become fertile if cross\r\npollinated from a different variety of pear.\r\n\r\n=851. Pollination of the skunk’s cabbage.=—In many other flowers\r\ncross pollination is brought about through the agency of insects,\r\nwhere there is a difference in time of the maturing of the stamens and\r\npistils of the same flower. The skunk’s cabbage (Spathyema fœtida),\r\nthough repulsive on account of its fetid odor, is nevertheless a very\r\ninteresting plant to study for several reasons. Early in the spring,\r\nbefore the leaves appear, and in many cases as soon as the frost is out\r\nof the hard ground, the hooked beak of the large fleshy spathe of this\r\nplant pushes its way through the soil.\r\n\r\nIf we cut away one side of the spathe as shown in fig. 459 we shall\r\nhave the flowering spadix brought closely to view. In this spadix the\r\npistil of each crowded flower has pushed its style through between the\r\nplates of armor formed by the converging ends of the sepals, and stands\r\nout alone with the brush-like stigma ready for pollination, while the\r\nstamens of all the flowers of this spadix are yet hidden beneath. The\r\ninsects which pass from the spadix of one plant to another will, in\r\ncrawling over the projecting stigmas, rub off some of the pollen which\r\nhas been caught while visiting a plant where the stamens are scattering\r\ntheir pollen. In this way cross pollination is brought about. Such\r\nflowers, in which the stigma is prepared for pollination before the\r\nanthers of the same flower are ripe, are _proterogynous_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 458. Skunk’s cabbage.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 459. Proterogyny in skunk’s cabbage. (Photograph by\r\nthe author.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 460. Skunk’s cabbage; upper flowers proterandrous,\r\nlower ones proterogynous.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=852.= Now if we observe the spadix of another plant we may see a\r\ncondition of things similar to that shown in fig. 460. In the flowers\r\nin the upper part of the spadix here the anthers are wedging their way\r\nthrough between the armor-like plates formed by the sepals, while the\r\nstyles of the same flowers are still beneath, and the stigmas are not\r\nready for pollination. Such flowers are _proterandrous_, that is, the\r\nanthers are ripe before the stigmas of the same flowers are ready for\r\npollination. In this spadix the upper flowers are proterandrous, while\r\nthe lower ones are proterogynous, so that it might happen here that\r\nthe lower flowers would be pollinated by the pollen falling on them\r\nfrom the stamens of the upper flowers. This would be cross pollination\r\nso far as the flowers are concerned, but not so far as the plants\r\nare concerned. In some individuals, however, we find all the flowers\r\nproterandrous.\r\n\r\n=853. Spiders have discovered this curious relation of the flowers\r\nand insects.=—On several different occasions, while studying\r\nthe adaptations of the flowers of the skunk’s cabbage for cross\r\npollination, I was interested to find that the spiders long ago had\r\ndiscovered something of the kind, for they spread their nets here to\r\ncatch the unwary but useful insects. I have not seen the net spread\r\nover the opening in the spathe, but it is spread over the spadix\r\nwithin, reaching from tip to tip of either the stigmas, or stamens, or\r\nboth. Behind the spadix crouches the spider-trapper. The insect crawls\r\nover the edge of the spadix, and plunges unsuspectingly into the dimly\r\nlighted chamber below, where it becomes entangled in the meshes of the\r\nnet.\r\n\r\nFlowers in which the ripening of the anthers and maturing of the\r\nstigmas occur at different times are also said to be _dichogamous_.\r\n\r\n=854. Pollination of jack-in-the-pulpit.=—The jack-in-the-pulpit\r\n(Arisæma triphyllum) has made greater advance in the art of enforcing\r\ncross pollination. The larger number of plants here are, as we have\r\nfound, diœcious, the staminate flowers being on the spadix of one\r\nplant, while the pistillate flowers are on the spadix of another. In a\r\nfew plants, however, we find both female and male flowers on the same\r\nspadix.\r\n\r\n=855.= The pretty bell-flower (Campanula rotundifolia) is\r\ndichogamous and proterandrous (fig. 462). Many of the composites are\r\nalso dichogamous.\r\n\r\n=856. Pollination of orchids.=—But some of the most marvellous\r\nadaptations for cross pollination by insects are found in the orchids,\r\nor members of the orchis family. The larger number of the members of\r\nthis family grow in the tropics. Many of these in the forests are\r\nsupported in lofty trees where they are brought near the sunlight,\r\nand such are called “epiphytes.” A number of species of orchids are\r\ndistributed in temperate regions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 461. A group of jacks.]\r\n\r\n=857. Cypripedium, or lady-slipper.=—One species of the\r\nlady-slipper is shown in fig. 468. The labellum in this genus is shaped\r\nlike a shoe, as one can see by the section of the flower in fig. 468.\r\nThe stigma is situated at _st_, while the anther is situated at _a_,\r\nupon the style. The insect enters about the middle of the boat-shaped\r\nlabellum. In going out it passes up and out at the end near the flower\r\nstalk. In doing this it passes the stigma first and the anther last,\r\nrubbing against both. The pollen caught on the head of the insect, will\r\nnot touch the stigma of the same flower, but will be in position to\r\ncome in contact with the stigma of the next flower visited.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 462. Proterandry in the bell-flower (campanula).\r\nLeft figure shows the syngenœcious stamens surrounding the immature\r\nstyle and stigma. Middle figure shows the immature stigma being pushed\r\nthrough the tube and brushing out the pollen; while in the right-hand\r\nfigure, after the pollen has disappeared, the lobes of the stigma open\r\nout to receive pollen from another flower.]\r\n\r\n=858. Epipactis.=—In epipactis, shown in fig. 469, the action is\r\nsimilar to that of the blue iris.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 463. Kalmia latifolia, showing position of anthers\r\nbefore insect visits, and at the right the scattering of the pollen\r\nwhen disturbed by insects. Middle figure section of flower.]\r\n\r\n=849.= In some of the tropical orchids the pollinia are set free\r\nwhen the insect touches a certain part of the flower, and are thrown\r\nin such a way that the disk of the pollinium strikes the insect’s head\r\nand stands upright. By the time the insect reaches another flower the\r\npollinium has bent downward sufficiently to strike against the stigma\r\nwhen the insect alights on the labellum. In the mountains of North\r\nCarolina I have seen a beautiful little orchid, in which, if one\r\ntouches a certain part of the flower with a lead-pencil or other\r\nsuitable object, the pollinium is set free suddenly, turns a complete\r\nsomersault in the air, and lands with the disk sticking to the pencil.\r\nMany of the orchids grown in conservatories can be used to demonstrate\r\nsome of these peculiar mechanisms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 464. Spray of leaves and flowers of cytisus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 465. Flower of cytisus grown in conservatory. Same\r\nflower scattering pollen.]\r\n\r\n=860. Pollination of the canna.=—In the study of some of the\r\nmarvellous adaptations of flowers for cross pollination one is led to\r\ninquire if, after all, plants are not intelligent beings, instead of\r\nmere automatons which respond to various sorts of stimuli. No plant\r\nhas puzzled me so much in this respect as the canna, and any one will\r\nbe well repaid for a study of recently opened flowers, even though it\r\nmay be necessary to rise early in the morning to unravel the mystery,\r\nbefore bees or the wind have irritated the labellum. The canna flower\r\nis a bewildering maze of petals and petal-like members. The calyx\r\nis green, adherent to the ovary, and the limb divides into three,\r\nlanceolate lobes. The petals are obovate and spreading, while the\r\nstamens have all changed to petal-like members, called _staminodia_.\r\nOnly one still shows its stamen origin, since the anther is seen at one\r\nside, while the filament is expanded laterally and upwards to form the\r\n_staminodium_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 466. Spartium, showing the dusting of the pollen\r\nthrough the opening keels on the under side of an insect. (From Kerner\r\nand Oliver.)]\r\n\r\n=861.= The ovary has three locules, and the three styles are\r\nusually united into a long, thin, strap-shaped style, as seen in the\r\nfigure, though in some cases three, nearly distinct, filamentous styles\r\nare present. The end of this strap-shaped style has a peculiar curve on\r\none side, the outline being sometimes like a long narrow letter S. It\r\nis on the end of this style, and along the crest of this curve, that\r\nthe stigmatic surface lies, so that the pollen must be deposited on the\r\nstigmatic end or margin in order that fertilization may take place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 467. Cypripedium.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 468. Section of flower of cypripedium. _st_,\r\nstigma; _a_, at the left stamen. The insect enters the labellum at\r\nthe center, passes under and against the stigma, and out through the\r\nopening _b_, where it rubs against the pollen. In passing through\r\nanother flower this pollen is rubbed off on the stigma.]\r\n\r\n=862.= If we open carefully canna flower buds which are nearly\r\nready to open naturally, by unwrapping the folded petals and\r\nstaminodia, we shall see the anther-bearing staminodium is so wrapped\r\naround the flattened style that the anther lies closely pressed against\r\nthe face of the style, near the margin _opposite that on which the\r\nstigma lies_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 469. Epipactis with portion of perianth removed\r\nto show details. _l_, labellum; _st_, stigma; _r_, rostellum; _p_,\r\npollinium. When the insect approaches the flower its head strikes the\r\ndisk of the pollinium and pulls the pollinium out. At this time the\r\npollinium stands up out of the way of the stigma. By the time the\r\ninsect moves to another flower the pollinia have moved downward so that\r\nthey are in position to strike the stigma and leave the pollen. At the\r\nright is the head of a bee, with two pollinia (_a_) attached.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 470. Canna flowers with the perianth removed to\r\nshow the depositing of the pollen on the style by the stamen.]\r\n\r\n=863.= The walls of the anther locules which lie against the style\r\nbecome changed to a sticky substance for their entire length, so that\r\nthey cling firmly to the surface of the style and also to the mass of\r\npollen within the locules. The result is that when the flower opens,\r\nand this staminodium unwraps itself from the embrace of the style,\r\nthe mass of pollen is left there deposited, while the empty anther is\r\nturned around to one side.\r\n\r\n=668.= Why does the flower deposit its own pollen on the style?\r\nSome have regarded this as the act of pollination, and have concluded,\r\ntherefore, that cannas are necessarily self pollinated, and that cross\r\npollination does not take place. But why is there such evident care to\r\ndeposit the pollen on the side of the style away from the stigmatic\r\nmargin? If we visit the cannas some morning, when a number of the\r\nflowers have just opened, and the bumblebees are humming around seeking\r\nfor nectar, we may be able to unlock the secret.\r\n\r\n=864.= We see that in a recently opened canna flower, the petal\r\nwhich directly faces the style in front stands upward quite close to\r\nit, so that the flower now is somewhat funnel-shaped. This front petal\r\nis the _labellum_, and is the landing place for the bumblebee as he\r\nalights on the flower. Here he comes humming along and alights on the\r\nlabellum with his head so close to the style that it touches it. But\r\njust the instant that the bee attempts to crowd down in the flower the\r\nlabellum suddenly bends downward, as shown in fig. 468. In so doing the\r\nhead of the bumblebee scrapes against the pollen, bearing some of it\r\noff. Now while the bee is sipping the nectar it is too far below the\r\nstigma to deposit any pollen on the latter. When the bumblebee flies to\r\nanother newly opened flower, as it alights, some of the pollen of the\r\nformer flower is brushed on the stigma.\r\n\r\n=865.= One can easily demonstrate the sensitiveness of the\r\nlabellum of recently opened canna flowers, if the labellum has not\r\nalready moved down in response to some stimulus. Take a lead-pencil, or\r\na knife blade, or even the finger, and touch the upper surface of the\r\nlabellum by thrusting it between the latter and the style. The labellum\r\ncurves quickly downward.\r\n\r\n=866.= Sometimes the bumblebees, after sipping the nectar, will\r\ncrawl up over the style in a blundering manner. In this way the flower\r\nmay be pollinated with its own pollen, which is equivalent to self\r\npollination. Undoubtedly self pollination does take place often in\r\nflowers which are adapted, to a greater or less degree, for cross\r\npollination by insects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 471. Pollination of the canna flower by bumblebee.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Canna flower. Pollen on style, stamen at left.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.\r\n\r\nTHE FRUIT.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Parts of the Fruit.\r\n\r\n=867. After the flower comes the fruit.=—With the perfection of\r\nthe fruit the seed is usually formed. This is the end towards which the\r\nenergies of the plant have been directed. While the seed consists only\r\nof the ripened ovule and the contained embryo, the fruit consists of\r\nthe ripened ovary in addition, and in many cases with other accessory\r\nparts, as calyx, receptacle, etc., combined with it. The wall of the\r\nripened ovary is called a _pericarp_, and the walls of the ovary form\r\nthe walls of the fruit.\r\n\r\n=868. Pericarp, endocarp, exocarp, etc.=—This is the part of the\r\nfruit which envelops the seed and may consist of the carpels alone, or\r\nof the carpels and the adherent part of the receptacle, or calyx. In\r\nmany fruits the pericarp shows a differentiation into layers, or zones\r\nof tissue, as in the cherry, peach, plum, etc. The outer, which is\r\nhere soft and fleshy, is _exocarp_, while the inner, which is hard, is\r\nthe _endocarp_. An intermediate layer is sometimes recognized and is\r\ncalled _mesocarp_. In such cases the skin of the fruit is recognized as\r\nthe _epicarp_. Epicarp and mesocarp are more often taken together as\r\nexocarp.\r\n\r\nIn general fruits are _dry_ or _fleshy_. Dry fruits may be grouped\r\nunder two heads. Those which open at maturity and scatter the seed are\r\n_dehiscent_. Those which do not open are _indehiscent_.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Indehiscent Fruits.\r\n\r\n=869. The akene.=—The thin dry wall of the ovary encloses the\r\nsingle seed. It usually does not open and free the seed within. Such a\r\nfruit is an _akene_. An _akene_ is a dry, _indehiscent_ fruit. All of\r\nthe crowded but separate pistils in the buttercup flower when ripe make\r\na head of akenes, which form the fruit of the buttercup. Other examples\r\nof akenes are found in other members of the buttercup family, also in\r\nthe composites, etc. The sunflower seed is a good example of an akene.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 472. Seed, or akene, of buttercup.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 473. Fruit of red oak. An acorn.]\r\n\r\n=870. The samara.=—The winged fruits of the maple, elm, etc., are\r\nindehiscent fruits. They are sometimes called key fruits.\r\n\r\n=871. The caryopsis= is a dry fruit in which the seed is\r\nconsolidated with the wall of the ovary, as in the wheat, corn, and\r\nother grasses.\r\n\r\n=872. The schizocarp= is a dry fruit consisting of several locules\r\n(from a _syncarpous gynœcium_). At maturity the carpels separate from\r\neach other, but do not themselves dehisce and free the seed, as in the\r\ncarrot family, mallow family.\r\n\r\n=873. The acorn.=—The acorn fruit consists of the acorn and\r\nthe “cup” at the base in which the acorn sits. The cup is a curious\r\nstructure, and is supposed to be composed of an involucre of numerous\r\nsmall leaves at the base of the pistillate flower, which become\r\nconsolidated into a hard cup-shaped body. When the acorn is ripe it\r\neasily separates from the cup, but the hard pericarp forming the\r\n“shell” of the acorn remains closed. Frost may cause it to crack, but\r\nvery often the pericarp is split open at the smaller end by wedge-like\r\npressure exerted by the emerging radicle during germination.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 474. Germinating acorn of white oak.]\r\n\r\n=874. The hazelnut, chestnut, and beechnut.=—In these fruits a\r\ncrown of leaves (involucre) at the base of the flower grows around\r\nthe nut and completely envelops it, forming the husk or burr. When\r\nthe fruit is ripe the nut is easily shelled out from the husk. In the\r\nbeechnut and chestnut the burr dehisces as it dries and allows the nut\r\nto drop out. But the fruit is not dehiscent, since the pericarp is\r\nstill intact and encloses the seed.\r\n\r\n=875. The hickory-nut, walnut, and butternut.=—In these fruits the\r\n“shuck” of the hickory-nut and the “hull” of the walnut and butternut\r\nare different from the involucre of the acorn or hazelnut, etc. In the\r\nhickory-nut the “shuck” probably consists partly of calyx and partly of\r\ninvolucral bracts consolidated, probably the calyx part predominating.\r\nThis part of the fruit splits open as it dries and frees the “nut,” the\r\npericarp being very hard and indehiscent. In the walnut and butternut\r\nthe “hull” is probably of like origin as the “shuck” of the hickory\r\nnut, but it does not split open as it ripens. It remains fleshy. The\r\nwalnut and butternut are often called _drupes_ or _stone-fruits_, but\r\nthe fleshy part of the fruit is not of the same origin as the fleshy\r\npart of the true drupes, like the cherry, peach, plum, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. Dehiscent Fruits.\r\n\r\n=876. Of the dehiscent fruits= several prominent types are\r\nrecognized, and in general they are sometimes called _pods_. There is a\r\nsingle carpel (simple pistil), and the pericarp is dry (gynœcium\r\n_apocarpous_); or where there are several carpels united the pistil is\r\ncompound (gynœcium _syncarpous_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 475. Diagrams illustrating three types (in\r\ncross-section) of the dehiscence of dry fruits. _Loc_, loculicidal;\r\n_Sep_, Septicidal, Septifragal.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 476. Fruit of sweet pea; a pod.]\r\n\r\n=877. The capsule.=—When the capsule is _syncarpous_ it may\r\ndehisce in three different ways: 1st. When the carpels split along\r\nthe line of their union with each other longitudinally (_septicidal\r\ndehiscence_), as in the azalea or rhododendron. 2d. When the carpels\r\n_split down the middle line_ (_loculicidal dehiscence_), as in the\r\nfruit of the iris, lily, etc. 3d. When the carpels open by pores\r\n(_poricidal dehiscence_), as in the poppy. Some syncarpous capsules\r\nhave but one locule, the partitions between the different locules when\r\nyoung having disappeared. The “bouncing-bet” is an example, and the\r\nseeds are attached to a central column in four rows corresponding to\r\nthe four locules present in the young stage.\r\n\r\n=878. A follicle= is a capsule with a single carpel which splits\r\nopen along the ventral or upper suture, as in the larkspur, peony.\r\n\r\n=879. The legume, or true pod=, is a capsule with a single carpel\r\nwhich splits along both sutures, as the pea, bean, etc. As the pod\r\nripens and dries, a strong twisting tension is often produced, which\r\nsplits the pod suddenly, scattering the seeds.\r\n\r\n=880. The silique.=—In the toothwort, shepherd’s-purse, and\r\nnearly all of the plants in the mustard family the fruit consists of\r\ntwo united carpels, which separate at maturity, leaving the partition\r\nwall persistent. Such a fruit is a _silique_; when short it is a\r\n_silicle_, or _pouch_.\r\n\r\n=881. A pyxidium, or pyxis=, is a capsule which opens with a lid,\r\nas in the plantain.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. Fleshy and Juicy Fruits.\r\n\r\n=882. The drupe, or stone-fruit.=—In the plum, cherry, peach,\r\napricot, etc., the outer portion (exocarp) of the pericarp (ovary)\r\nbecomes fleshy, while the inner portion (endocarp) becomes hard and\r\nstony, and encloses the seed, or “pit.” Such a fruit is known as a\r\ndrupe, or as a stone-fruit. In the almond the fleshy part of the fruit\r\nis removed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 477. Drupe, or stone-fruit, of plum.]\r\n\r\n=883. The raspberry and blackberry.=—While these fruits are\r\nknown popularly as “berries,” they are not berries in the technical\r\nsense. Each ovary, or pericarp, in the flower forms a single small\r\nfruit, the outer portion being fleshy and the inner stony, just as\r\nin the cherry or plum. It is a _drupelet_ (little drupe). All of the\r\ndrupelets together make the “berry,” and as they ripen the separate\r\ndrupelets cohere more or less. It is a collection, or aggregation, of\r\nfruits, and consequently they are sometimes called _collective fruits_,\r\nor _aggregate fruits_. In the raspberry the fruit separates from the\r\nreceptacle, leaving the latter on the stem, while the drupelets of\r\nthe blackberry and dewberry adhere to the receptacle and the latter\r\nseparates from the stem.\r\n\r\n=884. The berry.=—In the true berry both exocarp (including\r\nmesocarp) and endocarp are fleshy or juicy. Good examples are found\r\nin cranberries, huckleberries, gooseberries, currants, snowberries,\r\ntomatoes, etc. The calyx and wall of the pistil are adnate, and in\r\nfruit become fleshy so that the seeds are imbedded in the pulpy juice.\r\nThe seeds themselves are more or less stony. In the case of berries,\r\nas well as in strawberries, raspberries, and blackberries, the fruits\r\nare eagerly sought by birds and other animals for food. The seeds being\r\nhard are not digested, but are passed with the other animal excrement\r\nand thus gain dispersal.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. Reinforced, or Accessory, Fruits.\r\n\r\nWhen the torus (receptacle) is grown to the pericarp in fruit, the\r\nfruit is said to be _reinforced_. The torus may enclose the pericarps,\r\nor the latter may be seated upon the torus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 478. Fruit of raspberry.]\r\n\r\n=885. In the strawberry= the receptacle of the flower becomes\r\nlarger and fleshy, while the “seeds,” which are akenes, are sunk in the\r\nsurface and are hard and stony. The strawberry thus differs from the\r\nraspberry and blackberry, but like them it is not a true berry.\r\n\r\n=886. The apple, pear, quince, etc.=—In the flower the calyx,\r\ncorolla, and stamens are perigynous, i.e., they are seated on the\r\nmargin of the receptacle, or torus, which is elevated around the\r\npistils. In fruit the receptacle becomes consolidated with the wall\r\nof the ovary (with the pericarp). The torus thus _reinforces_ the\r\npericarp. The torus and outer portion of the pericarp become fleshy,\r\nwhile the inner portion of the pericarp becomes papery and forms the\r\n“core.” The calyx persists on the free end of the fruit. Such a fruit\r\nis called a _pome_. The receptacle, or torus, of the rose-flower,\r\nclosely related to the apple, is instructive when used in comparison.\r\nThe rose-fruit is called a “hip.”\r\n\r\n=887. The pepo.=—The fruit of the squash, pumpkin, cucumber,\r\netc., is called a _pepo_. The outer part of the fruit is the receptacle\r\n(or torus), which is consolidated with the outer part of the\r\nthree-loculed ovary. The calyx, which, with the corolla and stamens,\r\nwas epigynous, falls off from the young fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. Fruits of Gymnosperms.\r\n\r\nThe fruits of the gymnosperms differ from nearly all of the angiosperms\r\nin that the seed formed from the ripened ovule is naked from the first,\r\ni.e., the ovary, or carpel, does not enclose the seed.\r\n\r\n=888. The cone-fruit= is the most prominent fruit of the\r\ngymnosperms, as can be seen in the cones of various species of pine,\r\nspruce, balsam, etc.\r\n\r\n=889. Fleshy fruits of the gymnosperms.=—Some of the fleshy\r\nfruits resemble the stone-fruits and berries of the angiosperms. The\r\n_cedar_ “_berries_,” for example, are fleshy and contain several seeds.\r\nBut the fleshy part of the fruit is formed, not from pericarp, since\r\nthere is no pericarp, but from the outer portion of the ovules, while\r\nthe inner walls of the ovules form the hard stone surrounding the\r\nendosperm and embryo. An examination of the pistillate flower of the\r\ncedar (juniper) shows usually three flask-shaped ovules on the end\r\nof a fertile shoot subtended by as many bracts (carpels?). The young\r\novules are free, but as they grow they coalesce, and the outer walls\r\nbecome fleshy, forming a berry-like fruit with a three-rayed crevice\r\nat the apex marking the number of ovules. The red fleshy fruit of the\r\nyew (taxus) resembles a drupe which is open at the apex. The stony\r\nseed is formed from the single ovule on the fertile shoot, while the\r\nred cup-shaped fleshy part is formed from the outer integument of the\r\novule. The so-called “aril” of the young ovule is a rudimentary outer\r\nintegument.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the maidenhair tree (ginkgo) is about the size of a plum\r\nand resembles very closely a stone-fruit. But it is merely a ripened\r\novule, the outer layer becoming fleshy while the inner layer becomes\r\nstony and forms the pit which encloses the embryo and endosperm.\r\nThe so-called “aril,” or “collar,” at the base of the fruit is the\r\nrudimentary carpel, which sometimes is more or less completely expanded\r\ninto a true leaf. The fruit of cycas is similar to that of ginkgo, but\r\nthere is no collar at the base. In zamia the fruit is more like a cone,\r\nthe seeds being formed, however, on the under sides of the scales.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. The “Fruit” of Ferns, Mosses, etc.\r\n\r\n=890. The term “fruit”= is often applied in a general or popular\r\nsense to the groups of spore-producing bodies of ferns (_fruit dots_,\r\nor _sori_), the spore-capsules of mosses and liverworts, and also to\r\nthe fruit-bodies, or spore-bearing parts, of the fungi and algæ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV.\r\n\r\nSEED DISPERSAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n=891. Means for dissemination of seeds.=—During late summer\r\nor autumn a walk in the woods or afield often convinces us of the\r\nperfection and variety of means with which plants are provided for the\r\ndissemination of their seeds, especially when we discover that several\r\nhundred seeds or fruits of different plants are stealing a ride at\r\nour expense and annoyance. The hooks and barbs on various seed-pods\r\ncatch into the hairs of passing animals and the seeds may thus be\r\ntransported considerable distances. Among the plants familiar to us,\r\nwhich have such contrivances for unlawfully gaining transportation,\r\nare the beggar-ticks or stick tights, or sometimes called bur-marigold\r\n(bidens), the tick-treefoil (desmodium), or cockle-bur (xanthium), and\r\nburdock (arctium).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 479. Bur of bidens or bur-marigold, showing barbed\r\nseeds.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 480. Seed pod of tick-treefoil (desmodium); at the\r\nright some of the hooks greatly magnified.]\r\n\r\n=892.= Other plants like some of the sedges, etc., living on the\r\nmargins of streams and of lakes, have seeds which are provided with\r\nfloats. The wind or the flowing of the water transports them often to\r\ndistant points.\r\n\r\n=893.= Many plants possess attractive devices, and offer a\r\nsubstantial reward, as a price for the distribution of their seeds.\r\nFruits and berries are devoured by birds and other animals; the seeds\r\nwithin, often passing unharmed, may be carried long distances. Starchy\r\nand albuminous seeds and grains are also devoured, and while many\r\nsuch seeds are destroyed, others are not injured, and finally are\r\nlodged in suitable places for growth, often remote from the original\r\nlocality. Thus animals willingly or unwillingly become agents in the\r\ndissemination of plants over the earth. Man in the development of\r\ncommerce is often responsible for the wide distribution of harmful as\r\nwell as beneficial species.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 481. Seeds of geum showing the hooklets where the\r\nend of the style is kneed.]\r\n\r\n=894.= Other plants are more independent, and mechanisms are\r\nemployed for violently ejecting seeds from the pod or fruit. The\r\nunequal tension of the pods of the common vetch (Vicia sativa) when\r\ndrying causes the valves to contract unequally, and on a dry summer day\r\nthe valves twist and pull in opposite directions until they suddenly\r\nsnap apart, and the seeds are thrown forcibly for some distance. In the\r\nimpatiens, or touch-me-not as it is better known, when the pods are\r\nripe, often the least touch, or a pinch, or jar, sets the five valves\r\nfree, they coil up suddenly, and the small seeds are thrown for several\r\nyards in all directions. During autumn, on dry days, the pods of the\r\nwitch hazel contract unequally, and the valves are suddenly spread\r\napart, and the seeds are hurled away.\r\n\r\nOther plants have seeds provided with tufts of pappus, or hair-like\r\nmasses, or wing-like outgrowths which serve to buoy them up as they are\r\nwhirled along, often miles away. In late spring or early summer the\r\npods of the willow burst open, exposing the seeds, each with a tuft of\r\nwhite hairs making a mass of soft down. As the delicate hairs dry, they\r\nstraighten out in a loose spreading tuft, which frees the individual\r\nseeds from the compact mass. Here they are caught by currents of air\r\nand float off singly or in small clouds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 482. Touch-me-not (Impatiens fulva); side and front\r\nview of flower below; above unopened pod, and opening to scatter the\r\nseed.]\r\n\r\n=895. The prickly lettuce.=—In late summer or early autumn the\r\nseeds of the prickly lettuce (Lactuca scariola) are caught up from the\r\nroadsides by the winds, and carried to fields where they are unbidden\r\nas well as unwelcome guests. This plant is shown in fig. 483.\r\n\r\n=896. The wild lettuce.=—A related species, the wild lettuce\r\n(Lactuca canadensis) occurs on roadsides and in the borders of fields,\r\nand is about one meter in height. The heads of small yellow or purple\r\nflowers are arranged in a loose or branching panicle. The flowers are\r\nrather inconspicuous, the rays projecting but little above the apex of\r\nthe enveloping involucral bracts, which closely press together, forming\r\na flowerhead more or less flask-shaped.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 483. Lactuca scariola.]\r\n\r\nAt the time of flowering the involucral bracts spread somewhat at the\r\napex, and the tips of the flowers are a little more prominent. As the\r\nflowers then wither, the bracts press closely together again and the\r\nhead is closed. As the seeds ripen the bracts die, and in drying bend\r\noutward and downward, around the flower stem below, or they fall away.\r\nThe seeds are thus exposed. The dark brown achenes stand over the\r\nsurface of the receptacle, each one tipped with the long slender\r\nbeak of the ovary. The “pappus,” which is so abundant in many of the\r\nplants belonging to the composite family, forms here a pencil-like\r\ntuft at the tip of this long beak. As the involucral bracts dry and\r\ncurve downward, the pappus also dries, and in doing so bends downward\r\nand stands outward, bristling like the spokes of a small wheel. It is\r\nan interesting coincidence that this takes place simultaneously with\r\nthe pappus of all the seeds of a head, so that the ends of the pappus\r\nbristles of adjoining seeds meet, forming a many-sided dome of a\r\ndelicate and beautiful texture. This causes the beaks of the achenes to\r\nbe crowded apart, and with the leverage thus brought to bear upon the\r\nachenes they are pried off the receptacle. They are thus in a position\r\nto be wafted away by the gentlest zephyr, and they go sailing away on\r\nthe wind like a miniature parachute. As they come slowly to the ground\r\nthe seed is thus carefully lowered first, so that it touches the ground\r\nin a position for the end which contains the root of the embryo to come\r\nin contact with the soil.\r\n\r\n=897. The milkweed, or silkweed.=—The common milkweed, or\r\nsilkweed (Asclepias cornuti), so abundant in rich grounds, is\r\nattractive not only because of the peculiar pendent flower clusters,\r\nbut also for the beautiful floats with which it sends its seeds\r\nskyward, during a puff of wind, to finally lodge on the earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 484. Milkweed (Asclepias cornuti); dissemination of\r\nseed.]\r\n\r\n=898.= The large boat-shaped, tapering pods, in late autumn, are\r\npacked with oval, flattened, brownish seeds, which overlap each other\r\nin rows like shingles on a roof. These make a pretty picture as the pod\r\nin drying splits along the suture on the convex side, and exposes them\r\nto view. The silky tufts of numerous long, delicate white hairs on the\r\ninner end of each seed, in drying, bristle out, and thus lift the seeds\r\nout of their enclosure, where they are caught by the breeze and borne\r\naway often to a great distance, where they will germinate if conditions\r\nbecome favorable, and take their places as contestants in the battle\r\nfor existence.\r\n\r\n=899. The virgin’s bower.=—The virgin’s bower (Clematis\r\nvirginiana), too, clambering over fence and shrub, makes a show of\r\nhaving transformed its exquisite white flower clusters into\r\ngrayish-white tufts, which scatter in the autumn gusts into hundreds\r\nof arrow-headed, spiral plumes. The achenes have plumose styles, and\r\nthe spiral form of the plume gives a curious twist to the falling seed\r\n(fig. 485).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 485. Seed distribution of virgin’s bower\r\n(clematis).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI.\r\n\r\nVEGETATION IN RELATION TO ENVIRONMENT.[47]\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Factors Influencing Vegetation Types.\r\n\r\n=900.= All plants are subject to the influence of environment\r\nfrom the time the seed begins to germinate until the seed is formed\r\nagain, or until the plant ceases to live. A suitable amount of warmth\r\nand moisture is necessary that the seed may germinate. Moisture may\r\nbe present, but if it is too cold, germination will not take place.\r\nSo in all the processes of life there are several conditions of the\r\nenvironment, or the “outside” of plants, which must be favorable for\r\nsuccessful growth and reproduction. Not only is this true, but the\r\nsurroundings of plants to a large extent determine the kind of plants\r\nwhich can grow in particular localities. It is also evident that the\r\nreaction of environment on plants has in a large measure caused them\r\nto take on certain forms and structures which fit them better to exist\r\nunder local conditions. In other cases where plants have varied by\r\nmutation (p. 338) some of the new forms may be more suited to the\r\nconditions of environment than others and they are more apt to survive.\r\nThese conditions of environment acting on the plant are _factors_ which\r\nhave an important determining influence on the existence, habitat,\r\nhabit, and form of the plant. These factors are sometimes spoken of\r\nas _ecological factors_, and the study of plants in this relation is\r\nsometimes spoken of as ecology,[48] which means a study of plants in\r\ntheir home or a study of the household relations of plants. These\r\nfactors are of three sorts: 1st, physical factors; 2d, climatic\r\nfactors; 3d, biotic factors.\r\n\r\n=901. Physical factors.=—Some of these factors are water, light,\r\nheat, wind, chemical or physical condition of the soil, etc. _Water_\r\nis a very important factor for all plants. Even those growing on land\r\ncontain a large percentage of water, which we have seen is rapidly lost\r\nby transpiration, and unless water is available for root absorption\r\nthe plant soon suffers, and aquatic plants are injured very quickly by\r\ndrying when taken from the water. Excess of soil water is injurious to\r\nsome plants. _Light_ is important in photosynthesis, in determining\r\ndirection of growth as well as in determining the formation of suitable\r\nleaves in most plants, and has an influence in the structure of the\r\nleaf according as the light may be strong, weak, etc. _Heat_ has great\r\ninfluence on plant growth and on the distribution of plants. The\r\ngrowth period for most vegetation begins at 6° C. (= 43° F.), or in\r\nthe tropics at 10°-12° C., but a much higher temperature is usually\r\nnecessary for reproduction. Some arctic algæ, however, fruit at 1.8° C.\r\nThe upper limit favorable for plants in general is 45°-50° C., while\r\nthe optimum temperature is below this. Very high temperatures are\r\ninjurious, and fatal to most plants, but some algæ grow in hot springs\r\nwhere the temperature reaches 80°-90° C. Some desert plants are able to\r\nendure a temperature of 70° C., while some flowering plants of other\r\nregions are killed at 45° C. Some plants are specifically susceptible\r\nto cold, but most plants which are injured by freezing suffer because\r\nthe freezing is a drying process of the protoplasm (see p. 374). _Wind_\r\nmay serve useful purposes in pollination and in aeration, but severe\r\nwinds injure plants by causing too rapid transpiration, by felling\r\ntrees, by breaking plant parts, by deforming trees and shrubs, and by\r\nmechanical injuries from “sand-blast.” _Ground covers_ protect plants\r\nin several ways. Snow during the winter checks radiation of heat from\r\nthe ground so that it does not freeze to so great a depth, and this is\r\nvery important for many trees and shrubs. It also prevents alternate\r\nfreezing and thawing of the ground, which “heaves” some plants from\r\nthe soil. Leaves and other plant remains mulch the soil and check\r\nevaporation of water. The influence of the _chemical condition_ of the\r\nsoil is very marked in alkaline areas where the concentration of salt\r\nin the soil permits a very limited range of species. So the physical\r\nand mechanical conditions of the soil influence plants because the\r\nmoisture content of the ground is so closely dependent on its physical\r\ncondition. Rocky and gravelly soil, other things being equal, is dry.\r\nClay is more retentive of moisture than sand, and moisture also varies\r\naccording to the per cent of humus mixed with it, the humus increasing\r\nthe percentage of moisture retained.\r\n\r\n=902. Climatic factors.=—These factors are operative over very\r\nwide areas. There are two climatic factors: rainfall or atmospheric\r\nmoisture, and temperature. A very low annual rainfall in warm or\r\ntropical countries causes a desert; an abundance of rain permits the\r\ngrowth of forests; extreme cold prevents the growth of forests and\r\ngives us the low vegetation of arctic and alpine regions.\r\n\r\n=903. Biotic factors.=—These are animals which act favorably\r\nin pollination, seed distribution, or unfavorably in destroying or\r\ninjuring plants, and man himself is one of the great agencies in\r\nchecking the growth of some plants while favoring the growth of others.\r\nPlants also react on themselves in a multitude of ways for good or\r\nevil. Some are parasites on others; some in symbiosis (see p. 85) aid\r\nin providing food; shade plants are protected by those which overtop\r\nthem; mushrooms and other fungi disintegrate dead plants to make humus\r\nand finally plant food; certain bacteria by nitrification prepare\r\nnitrates for the higher plants (see p. 83).\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Vegetation Types and Structures.\r\n\r\n=904. Responsive type of vegetation.=—In studying vegetation in\r\nrelation to environment we are more concerned with the form of the\r\nplants which fits them to exist under the local conditions than we are\r\nwith the classification of plants according to natural relationships.\r\nPlants may have the same vegetation type, grow side by side, and still\r\nbelong to very different floristic types. For example, the cactus,\r\nyucca, three-leaved sumac, the sage-brush, etc., have all the same\r\ngeneral vegetation type and thrive in desert regions. The red oaks, the\r\nelms, many goldenrods, trillium, etc., have the same general vegetation\r\ntype, but represent very different floristic types. The latter plants\r\ngrow in regions with abundant rainfall throughout the year, where\r\nthe growing season is not very short and temperature conditions are\r\nmoderate. Some goldenrods grow in very sandy soil which dries out\r\nquickly. These have fleshy or succulent leaves for storing water,\r\nand while they are of the same floristic type as goldenrods growing\r\nin other places, the vegetation type is very different. The types of\r\nvegetation which fit plants for growing in special regions or under\r\nspecial conditions, they have taken on in response to the influence\r\nof the conditions of their environment. While we find all gradations\r\nbetween the different types of vegetation, looking at the vegetation\r\nin a broad way, several types are recognized which were proposed by\r\nWarming as follows:\r\n\r\n=905. Mesophytes.=—These are represented by land plants under\r\ntemperate or moderate climatic and soil conditions. The normal\r\nland vegetation of our temperate region is composed of mesophytes,\r\nthat is, the plants have mesophytic structures during the growing\r\nseason. The deciduous forests or thickets of trees and shrubs with\r\ntheir undergrowth, the meadows, pastures, prairies, weeds, etc., are\r\nexamples. In those portions of the tropics where rainfall is great the\r\nvegetation is mesophytic the year around.\r\n\r\n=906. Xerophytes.=—These are plants which are provided with\r\nstructures which enable them to live under severe conditions of\r\ndryness, where the air and soil are very dry, as in deserts or\r\nsemideserts, or where the soil is very dry or not retentive of\r\nmoisture, as in very sandy soil which is above ground water, or in\r\nrocky areas. Since the plants cannot obtain much water from the soil\r\nthey must be provided with structures which will enable them to\r\nretain the small amount they can absorb from the soil and give it off\r\nslowly. Otherwise they would dry out by evaporation and die. Some\r\nof the structures which enable xerophytic plants to withstand the\r\nconditions of dry climate and soil are lessened leaf surface, increase\r\nin thickness of leaf, increase in thickness of cuticle, deeply sunken\r\nstomates, compact growth, also succulent leaves and stems, and in some\r\ncases loss of the leaf. Evergreens of the north temperate and the\r\narctic regions are xerophytes.\r\n\r\n=907. Hydrophytes.=—These are plants which grow in fresh water\r\nor in very damp situations. The leaves of aerial hydrophytes are very\r\nthin, have a thin cuticle, and lose water easily, so that if the air\r\nbecomes quite dry they are in danger of drying up even though the roots\r\nmay be supplied with an abundance of water. The aquatic plants which\r\nare entirely submerged have often thin leaves, or very finely divided\r\nor slender leaves, since these are less liable to be torn by currents\r\nof water. The stems are slender and especially lack strengthening\r\ntissue, since the water buoys them up. Removed from the water they\r\ndroop of their own weight, and soon dry up. The stems and leaves have\r\nlarge intercellular spaces filled with air which aids in aeration and\r\nin the diffusion of gases. Some use the term _hygrophytes_.\r\n\r\n=908. Halophytes.=—These are salt-loving plants. They grow in\r\nsalt water, or in salt marshes where the water is brackish, or in\r\nsoil which contains a high per cent of certain salts, for example the\r\nalkaline soils of the West, especially in the so-called “Bad Lands”\r\nof Dakota and Nebraska, and in alkaline soils of the Southwest and\r\nCalifornia. These plants are able to withstand a stronger concentration\r\nof salts in the water than other plants. They are also found in soil\r\nabout salt springs.\r\n\r\n=909. Tropophytes.=[49]—Tropophytes are plants which can live as\r\nmesophytes during the growing season, and then turn to a xerophytic\r\nhabit in the resting season. Deciduous trees and shrubs, and perennial\r\nherbs of our temperate regions, are in this sense tropophytes, while\r\nmany are at the same time mesophytes if they exist in the portions of\r\nthe temperate region where rainfall is abundant. In the spring and\r\nsummer they have broad and comparatively thin leaves, transpiration\r\ngoes on rapidly, but there is an abundance of moisture in the soil,\r\nso that root absorption quickly replaces the loss and the plant does\r\nnot suffer. In the autumn the trees shed their leaves, and in this\r\ncondition with the bare twigs they are able to stand the drying effect\r\nof the cold and winds of the winter because transpiration is now at a\r\nminimum, while root absorption is also at a minimum because of the cold\r\ncondition of the soil. Perennial herbs like trillium, dentaria, the\r\ngoldenrods, etc., turn to xerophytic habit by the death of their aerial\r\nshoots, while the thick underground shoot which is also protected by\r\nits subterranean habit carries the plant through the winter.\r\n\r\n=910.= While these different vegetation types are generally\r\ndominant in certain climatic regions or under certain soil conditions,\r\nthey are not the exclusive vegetation types of the regions. For\r\nexample, in desert or semidesert regions the dominant vegetation\r\ntype is made up of xerophytes. But there is a mesophytic flora even\r\nin deserts, which appears during the rainy season where temperature\r\nconditions are favorable for growth. This is sometimes spoken of as the\r\nrainy-season flora. The plants are annuals and by formation of seed can\r\ntide over the dry season. So in the region where mesophytes grow there\r\nare xerophytes, examples being the evergreens like the pines, spruces,\r\nrhododendrons; or succulent plants like the stonecrop, the purslane,\r\netc. Then among hydrophytes the semiaquatics are really xerophytes. The\r\nroots are in water, and absorption is slow because there are no root\r\nhairs, or but few, and the aerial parts of the plant are xerophytic.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. Plant Formations.\r\n\r\n=911.= The term plant formation is applied to associations of\r\nplants of the same kind, though there is a great difference in the use\r\nof the word by different writers which leads to some confusion.[50] It\r\nis sometimes applied to an association of individuals of a species, or\r\nof several species occupying a rather definite area of ground where the\r\nsoil conditions are not greatly different (individual formation); by\r\nothers it is applied to the plants of a definite physiographic area, as\r\na swamp, moor, strand, or beach, bank, rock hill, clay hill, ravine,\r\nbluff, etc. (principal formation); and in a broad sense it is applied\r\nto the plants of climatic regions, of those in bodies of water, etc.\r\n(general formations). Space here is too limited to discuss all these\r\nkinds of formations, but the nature of the general formations will be\r\npointed out. The general formations may be grouped into four divisions:\r\n\r\n    1st. Climatic formations.\r\n     2d. Edaphic formations.\r\n     3d. Aquatic formations.\r\n    4th. Culture formations.\r\n\r\n=912. Climatic formations.=—Climatic influences extend over\r\nwide regions, so that climate controls the general type of vegetation\r\nof a region. In the sense of control there are two climatic factors,\r\ntemperature and moisture, especially soil moisture. Temperature exerts\r\na controlling influence over the vegetation type only where the total\r\nheat during the period of growth and reproduction is very low. This\r\noccurs in polar lands and at high elevations where the climate is\r\nalpine. In the temperate and tropical regions of the globe moisture,\r\nnot heat, controls the general vegetation type. These vegetation types\r\nin general are coincident with rainfall distribution, and Schimper\r\nrecognizes here three types, which with the arctic-alpine type would\r\nmake four climatic formations as follows:\r\n\r\n1st. _The woodland formation._—This formation is characterized by\r\ntrees and shrubs, and it is what is called a _close_ formation. By this\r\nit is meant that so far as the climate is concerned the conditions are\r\nfavorable for the development of trees and shrubs in such abundance\r\nthat they become the dominant vegetation type of the region and grow\r\nclose together. Other plants, as herbs, grasses, etc., occur, but\r\nthey grow as subordinate elements of the general vegetation type, and\r\nas undergrowth. The land portion of the globe, therefore, outside of\r\narctic and alpine regions, where the annual precipitation is 40 to 60\r\nor more inches, is the area for woodland formation. In some places,\r\nthe eastern part of England, for example, the annual precipitation is\r\n25 to 30 inches, but the cool temperature permits a forest growth. It\r\nis true there are places where forests do not grow,—where man cuts\r\nthem down, for example. But if cultivated lands in this region were\r\nallowed to go to waste, they would in time grow up to forest again.\r\nSo there are swamps where the soil is too wet for trees, or sandy or\r\nrocky areas where there is not a sufficient amount of soil or water to\r\nsupport forest trees. But here it is the soil conditions, not climatic\r\nconditions, which prevent the development of the forest. But we know\r\nthat swamps are being filled in and the ground gradually becoming\r\nhigher and drier, and that soil is slowly accumulating in rocky areas,\r\nso that in time if left to natural forces these places would become\r\nforested. So this area of heavy annual rainfall is a _potential_ forest\r\narea. These areas are determined by warm currents of moisture-laden\r\nair from the ocean moving over cooler land areas where the moisture\r\nis precipitated. In general these areas are along the coasts of great\r\ncontinents and on mountains. Therefore the interior of a continent is\r\napt to be dry because most of the moisture has been precipitated before\r\nit reaches the interior. Deserts or steppes are therefore usually near\r\nthe interior of continents. Some exceptions to this general rule are\r\nfound: central South America, which is a region of exceptional rainfall\r\nbecause the moisture-laden winds here come from the warmest part of the\r\nocean; the desert region west of the Andes mountains, where the winds\r\nare not favorable; southern California, where the winds come chiefly\r\nfrom a cooler portion of the Pacific ocean and move over an area of\r\nhigh temperature, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 486. Typical prairie scene, a few miles west of\r\nLincoln, Nebraska. (Bot. Dept., Univ. Nebraska.)]\r\n\r\n2d. _Grassland formation._—Grasses form the dominant vegetation\r\ntype where the annual rainfall is approximately 15 to 25 inches. In\r\ntrue grasslands the formation is a close one since there is still a\r\nsufficient amount of moisture to provide for all the plants which can\r\nstand on the ground. Yet there is not enough moisture to permit the\r\ngrowth of forest as the dominant type without aid and protection by\r\nman. The so-called prairie regions are examples. Trees and shrubs do\r\noccur, but they cannot compete successfully with the grasses because\r\nthe climatic conditions are favorable for the latter and unfavorable\r\nfor the former. On the border line between forest and prairie the line\r\nof division is not a clear-cut one because conditions grade from one to\r\nthe other. The two formations are somewhat mixed, like the outposts of\r\ncontending armies, arms of the forest or prairie extending out here and\r\nthere. In the United States the prairies extend from Illinois to about\r\nthe 100th meridian, and beyond this to the foothills of the Rockies and\r\nsouthwest to the Sonora Nevada desert the region is drier, the rainfall\r\nvarying from 10 to 20 inches. This is the area of the Great Plains,\r\nand while grasses of the bunch type are dominant, they make a more or\r\nless open formation because the moisture is not sufficient to supply\r\nall the plants which could be crowded on the ground, each individual\r\ntuft needing an area of ground surrounding it on which it can draw\r\nfor moisture. Such a formation is an open one, and in this respect is\r\nsimilar to desert formations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 487. Winter range in northwestern Nevada, showing\r\nopen formation; white sage (Eurotia lanata) in foreground, salt-bush\r\n(Atriplex confertifolia) and bud-sage (Artemisia spinescens) at base\r\nof hill, red sage (Kochia americana) on the higher slope. (After\r\nGriffiths, Bull. 38, Bureau Plant Ind., U. S. Dept. Agr.)]\r\n\r\n3d. _Desert formations._—These occur where the annual rainfall is\r\nstill lower, 10 to 4 inches or even less, 2 to 3 inches, while in\r\none place in Chili it is as low as ½ inch. In the great Sahara desert\r\nit is about 8 inches, while in the Sonora Nevada desert in the\r\nsouthwestern United States it is 4 to 8 inches. Here the formation is\r\nan open one. In the forest and prairie formations the plants compete\r\nwith each other for occupancy of the ground, since climatic conditions\r\nare favorable, so that the struggle against climate is not severe.\r\nBut in the desert plants do not compete with each other; since the\r\nclimate is so austere, the struggle is against the climate. Hence\r\nplants stand at some distance from each other because the roots need\r\nthe moisture from the ground for some distance around them. There is\r\nnot enough moisture for all the plants that begin, and those which get\r\nthe start take the moisture away from the intervening ones, which then\r\ndie. Since the struggle is against the adverse conditions of climate\r\nand not a competition between plants to occupy the ground, no one\r\nfloristic type dominates as in the case of the grasses and forests of\r\nthe grassland and woodland formations, but grassland and woodland types\r\ngrow together. So we find grasses, trees, and shrubs growing without\r\ncompetition in the desert. The dominant vegetation type is xerophytic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 488. Northern limit of tree growth, Alaska.\r\n(Copyright, 1899, by E. H. Harriman.)]\r\n\r\n4th. _Arctic-alpine formation._ This formation extends from the limit\r\nof tree growth to the region of perpetual ice and snow. The forest\r\nhere comes in competition with climate, with the severe cold of the\r\nlong winter night, so that tree growth is limited, and on the border\r\nline with the woodland formation the trees are stunted, bent to one\r\nside by the heavy snows, or the tops are killed by the cold wind. The\r\narctic zone of plant growth is sometimes spoken of as the “cold waste,”\r\nsince conditions here are somewhat similar to those in the desert, the\r\nextreme cold exercising a drying effect on vegetation, and the\r\nvegetation type then is largely xerophytic.\r\n\r\n=913. Edaphic[51] formations.=—Edaphic formations may occur\r\nin any of the climatic-formation areas. They are controlled by the\r\ncondition of soil or ground. The condition of the soil is unfavorable\r\nfor the growth of the general vegetation type of that region, or is\r\nmore favorable for another vegetation type, so that soil conditions\r\novercome the climatic conditions. These areas include swamps, moors,\r\nthe strand or beach, rocky areas, etc., as well as oases in the desert,\r\nwarm oases in the arctic zone, river bottoms in the prairie and plains\r\nregion, alkaline areas, etc. The edaphic formations may be close or\r\nopen according to the nature of the soil. The edaphic formations then\r\nare infiltrated in the climatic formations, the different vegetation\r\ntypes fitting together like pieces of mosaic, which can be seen in some\r\nplaces from a mountain top, or if one could take a bird’s-eye view of\r\nthe landscape or from a balloon.\r\n\r\n=914. Aquatic formations.=—These are made up of water plants and\r\nare of two general kinds: fresh-water plant formations in ponds, lakes,\r\nstreams; and salt-water plant formations in the ocean and inland salt\r\nseas.\r\n\r\n=915. Culture formations.=—Culture formations are largely\r\ncontrolled by man, who destroys the climatic or edaphic formation and\r\nby cultivation protects cultivated types, or by allowing land to go to\r\n“waste” permits the growth of weeds, though weeds are often abundant\r\nin the culture areas. In general the culture formations may be grouped\r\ninto two subdivisions: 1st, the vegetation of cultivated places; and\r\n2d, the vegetation of waste places, as abandoned fields, roadsides, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. Plant Societies.\r\n\r\n=916. Plant societies= are somewhat definite associations of the\r\nvegetation of an area marked by physiographic conditions. A single\r\nplant society is nearly if not altogether identical with a “_principal\r\nformation_,” but is a more popular expression, and besides includes all\r\nthe plants growing on the area, while in the use of the term “principal\r\nformation” we have reference mainly to the dominant plants and the most\r\nconspicuous subordinate species.\r\n\r\n=917. Complex character of plant societies.=—In their broadest\r\nanalysis all plant societies are complex. Every plant society has one\r\nor several dominant species, the individuals of which, because of\r\ntheir number and size, give it its peculiar character. The society may\r\nbe so nearly pure that it appears to consist of the individuals of a\r\nsingle species. But even in those cases there are small and conspicuous\r\nplants of other species which occupy spaces between the dominant ones.\r\nUsually there are several or more kinds in the same society. The larger\r\nindividuals come into competition for first place in regard to ground\r\nand light, the smaller ones come into competition for the intervening\r\nspaces for shade, and so on down in the scale of size and shade\r\ntolerance. Then climbing plants (lianas) and epiphytes (lichens, algæ,\r\nmosses, ferns, tree orchids, etc.) gain access to light and support by\r\ngrowing on other larger and stouter members of the society.\r\n\r\nParasites (dodder, mistletoes, rusts, smuts, mildews, bacteria, etc.)\r\nare present, either actually or potentially, in all societies, and in\r\ntheir methods of obtaining food sap the life and health of their hosts.\r\nThen come the scavenger members, whose work it is to clean house, as it\r\nwere, the great army of saprophytic fungi (molds, mushrooms, etc.), and\r\nbacteria ready to lay hold on dead and dying leaves, branches, trunks,\r\nroots, etc., disintegrate them, and reduce them to humus, where other\r\nfungi change them into a form in which the larger members of the plant\r\nsociety can utilize them as plant food and thus continue the cycle of\r\nmatter through life, death, decay, and into life again. Mycorhiza (see\r\nChapter IX) or other forms of mutualistic symbiosis occur which make\r\natmospheric nitrogen available for food, or shorten the path from humus\r\nto available food, or the humus plants feed on the humus directly.\r\nNor should we leave out of account the myriads of nitrate and nitrite\r\nbacteria (see Chapter IX) which make certain substances in the soil\r\navailable to the higher members of the society. Most plant societies\r\nare also benefited or profoundly influenced in other ways by animals,\r\nas the flower-visiting insects, birds which feed on injurious insects,\r\nthe worms which mellow up the soil and cover dead organic matter so\r\nthat it may more thoroughly decay. In short, every plant society is\r\na great cosmos like the universe itself of which it is a part, where\r\nmultitudinous forms, processes, influences, evolutions, degenerations,\r\nand regenerations are at work.\r\n\r\n=918. Forest Societies.=[52]—Each different climatic belt or\r\nregion has its characteristic forest. For example, the forests of\r\nthe Hudsonian zone in North America are different from those of\r\nthe Canadian zone, and these in turn different from those in the\r\ntransition zone (mainly in northern United States). The forests of\r\nthe Rocky mountains and of the Pacific coast differ from those of the\r\nAlleghanian, Carolinian (mainly middle United States) or Austroriparian\r\n(southern United States) areas. Finally, tropical forests are\r\nstrikingly different from those of other regions. Similar variations\r\noccur in the forests of other regions of the globe. The character of\r\nthese forests depends largely on climatic factors. The character of\r\nthe forest varies, however, even in the same climatic area, dependent\r\non soil conditions, or success in seeding and ground-gaining of the\r\ndifferent species in competition, etc.\r\n\r\n=919. General structure of the forest.=—Structurally the forest\r\npossesses three subdivisions: the floor, the canopy, and the interior.\r\nThe floor is the surface soil, which holds the rootage of the trees,\r\nwith its covering of leaf-mold and carpet of leaves, mosses, or other\r\nlow, more or less compact vegetation. The canopy is formed by the\r\nspreading foliage of the tree crowns, which, in a forest of an even\r\nand regular stand, meet and form a continuous mass of foliage through\r\nwhich some light filters down into the interior. Where the stand is\r\nirregular, i.e., the trees of different heights, the canopy is said to\r\nbe “compound” or “storied.” Where it is uneven, there are open places\r\nin the canopy which admit more light, in which case the undergrowth\r\nmay be different. The interior of the forest lies between the canopy\r\nand the floor. It provides for aeration of the floor and interior\r\noccupants, and also room for the boles or tree trunks (called by\r\nforesters the wood mass of the forest) which support the canopy and\r\nprovide the channels for communication and food exchange between the\r\nfloor and canopy. The canopy manufactures the carbohydrate food and\r\nassimilates the mineral and proteid substances absorbed by the roots in\r\nthe soil; and also gets rid of the surplus water needed for conveying\r\nfood materials from the floor to the place where they are elaborated.\r\nIt is the seat where energy is created for work, and also the place for\r\nseed production.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 489. Mature forest of redwood (Sequoia\r\nsempervirens). (Bureau of Forestry, U. S. Dept. Agr., Bull. 38.)]\r\n\r\n=920. Longevity of the forest.=—The forest is capable of\r\nself-perpetuation, and, except in case of unusual disaster or the\r\naction of man, it should live indefinitely. As the old trees die they\r\nare gradually replaced by younger ones. So while trees may come and\r\ntrees may go, the forest goes on forever.\r\n\r\n=921. Autumn colors.=—One of the striking effects produced by\r\nthe deciduous forests is that of the autumn coloring of the leaves.\r\nIt is more pronounced in the forests of the United States than in\r\ncorresponding life zones in the eastern hemisphere because of the\r\ngreater number of species. With the disintegration of the chlorophyll\r\nbodies, other colors, which in some cases were masked by the green,\r\nappear. In other cases decomposition products result in the formation\r\nof other colors, as red, scarlet, yellow, brown, purple, maroon, etc.,\r\nin different species. These coloring substances to some extent are\r\nbelieved to protect the nitrogenous substances in the leaf from injury.\r\nThe colors absorb the sun’s rays, which otherwise might destroy these\r\nnitrogenous substances before they have passed back through the petiole\r\nof the leaf into the stem, where they may be stored for food. The\r\ngorgeous display of color, then, which the leaves of many trees and\r\nshrubs put on is one of the many useful adaptations of the plants.\r\n\r\n=922. Importance of the forest in the disposal of rainfall.=—The\r\nimportance of the forest in disposing of the rainfall is very great.\r\nThe great accumulation of humus on the forest floor holds back the\r\nwater both by absorption and by checking its flow, so that it does not\r\nimmediately flow quickly off the slopes into the drainage system of the\r\nvalley. It percolates into the soil. Much of it is held in the humus\r\nand soil. What is not retained thus filters slowly through the soil\r\nand is doled out more gradually into the valley streams and mountain\r\ntributaries, so that the flood period is extended, and its injury\r\nlessened or entirely prevented, because the body of water moving at any\r\none time is not dangerously high. The winter snow is shaded and in the\r\nspring melts slowly, and the spring freshets are thus lessened. The\r\naction of the leaves and humus in retarding the flow of the water\r\nprevents the washing away of the soil; the roots of trees bind the soil\r\nalso and assist in holding it.\r\n\r\n=923. Absence of forest encourages serious floods.=—The great\r\nfloods of the Mississippi and its tributaries are due to the rapidity\r\nwith which heavy rainfall flows from the rolling prairies of the west,\r\nand from the deforested areas west of the Alleghany system. The serious\r\nfloods in recent years in some of the South Atlantic States are in\r\npart due to the increasing area of deforestation in the Blue Ridge and\r\nsouthern Alleghany system.\r\n\r\n=924. The prairie and plains societies.=—These are to be found\r\nin the grassland formation. In the prairies “meadows” are formed in\r\nthe lower ground near river courses where there is greater moisture\r\nin soil. The grasses here are principally “sod-formers” which have\r\ncreeping underground stems which mat together, forming a dense sod. On\r\nthe higher and drier ground the “bunch” grasses, like buffalo-grass,\r\nbeard-grass, or broom-sedge, etc., are dominant, and in the drier\r\nregions as one approaches desert conditions the vegetation gradually\r\ntakes on more the character of the desert, so that in the plains\r\nsage-brush, the prickly-pear cactus, etc., occur. Besides the dominant\r\nvegetation of the society there are subordinate species, and the\r\nsocieties are especially marked by a spring and autumn flora of\r\nconspicuous flowering plants which are mixed with the grasses.\r\n\r\n=925. Desert societies.=—These are composed of plants which\r\npossess a form or structure which enables them to exist in a very\r\ndry climate where the air is very dry and the soil contains but\r\nlittle moisture. The true desert plants are perennial. The growth and\r\nflowering period occurs during the rainy season, or those portions\r\nof the rainy season when the temperature is favorable, and they rest\r\nduring the very dry season and cold. Characteristic desert plants are\r\nthe cacti with thick succulent green stems or massive trunks, the\r\nleaves being absent or reduced to mere spines which no longer function\r\nin photosynthesis; yuccas with thick, narrow and long leaves with a\r\nfirm and thick cuticle; small shrubs or herbs with compact rounded\r\nhabit and small thick gray leaves. All of these structures conserve\r\nmoisture. The mesquite tree is one of the common trees in portions\r\nof the Sonora Nevada desert. Besides the true desert plants, desert\r\nsocieties have a rainy-season flora consisting of annuals, which can\r\ngerminate, vegetate, flower, and seed during the period of rain and\r\nbefore the ground moisture has largely disappeared, and these pass the\r\nresting period in seed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 490. Desert vegetation, Arizona, showing large\r\nsucculent trunks of cactus with shrubs and stunted trees. Open\r\nformation. (Photograph by Tuomey.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 491. Polar tundra with scattered flowers, Alaska.\r\n(Copyright by E. H. Harriman.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 492. Perennial rosette plant from alpine flora of\r\nthe Andes, showing short stem, rosette of leaves, and large flower.\r\n(After Schimper.)]\r\n\r\n=926. Arctic-alpine societies.=—The most striking of the arctic\r\nplant societies are the “polar tundra,” extensive mats of vegetation\r\nlargely made up of mosses, lichens, etc., only partially decayed\r\nbecause of the great cold of the subsoil, and perhaps also because\r\nof humus acid in the partially decayed vegetation. These tundras\r\nare brightened by numerous flowering plants which are characterized\r\nby short stems, a rosette of leaves near the ground, and by large\r\nbright-colored flowers. Heaths, saxifrages, and dwarf willow abound.\r\nAlpine plant societies are similar to the arctic, although some of the\r\nconditions are more severe than in the arctic region. This is\r\nprincipally due to the fact that during the summer while the plants are\r\ngrowing they are subject to a high temperature during the day and a\r\nvery low temperature at night, whereas during the summer in arctic\r\nregions while the plants are growing there is continuous warmth for\r\ngrowth and continuous light for photosynthesis. Five types of alpine\r\nplants are recognized by some. 1st. _Elfin tree._ This type has short,\r\ngnarled, often horizontal stems, as seen in pines, birches, and other\r\ntrees growing in alpine heights. 2d. _The alpine shrubs._ In the\r\nhighest alpine belts they are dwarfed and creeping, richly branched and\r\nspreading close to the ground, while at lower belts they are more like\r\nlowland shrubs. 3d. _The cushion type._ The branching is very profuse\r\nand the branches are short and touch each other on all sides, forming\r\ncompact masses (examples saxifrages, androsace, mosses, etc.). 4th.\r\n_Rosette plants._ These are perennial, short stems and very strong\r\nroots, and play an important part in the alpine meadows. 5th. _Alpine\r\ngrasses._ These usually have much shorter leaves than grasses of the\r\nlowlands and consequently form a low sward.\r\n\r\n=927. Edaphic plant societies.=—These are equivalent to edaphic\r\nplant formations, and the vegetation is of course controlled by the\r\npeculiar conditions of the soil. There are a number of different\r\nkinds of edaphic plant societies determined by the character of the\r\nphysiographic areas. 1st. _Sphagnum moors._ These are formed in shallow\r\nbasins originally with more or less water. The growth of the sphagnum\r\nmoss along with other vegetation and its partial decay in the water\r\nbuilds up ground rapidly so that in course of time the pond may be\r\ncompletely filled in. This filling in proceeds from the shore toward\r\nthe center, and in the early stages of course there would be a pond\r\nin the center. The partial decay of vegetation creates an excess of\r\nhumus acid which retards absorption by the roots. The conditions are\r\nsuch, then, as require aerial structures for retarding the loss of\r\nwater, and plants growing in such moors are usually xerophytes. Some of\r\nthe plants are identical with those growing in the arctic tundra. 2d.\r\n_Sand_[53] _strand of beach._ The quantity of sand with very little or\r\nno admixture of humus or plant food makes it difficult for plants to\r\nobtain a sufficient amount of water even where rainfall is abundant.\r\nThe same may be said of the sand dunes farther back from the shore. The\r\nplants of these areas are then usually xerophytes. Some of the plants\r\naccustomed to growing in such localities are American sea-rocket,\r\nseaside spurge, bugseed, sea-blite, sea-purslane, the sandcherry, dwarf\r\nwillow, marram-grass, certain species of beard-grass, etc. 3d. _Rocky\r\nshores or areas._ Here lichens and mosses first grow, later to be\r\nfollowed by herbs, grasses, shrubs, and trees, as decayed plant remains\r\naccumulate in the rock crevices. 4th. _Shores of ponds, or swamp\r\nmoors._ Here the vegetation often takes on a zonal arrangement if the\r\nground gradually slopes to the shore and out into the pond. In Fig. 493\r\nis shown zonal distribution of plants. The different kinds of plants\r\nare drawn into these zones by the varying amount of ground water in\r\nthe soil, or the varying depth of the water on the margin of the pond\r\nas one proceeds from the land towards the deeper water. On the border\r\nlines or tension lines between the different zones the plants are\r\nstruggling to occupy here ground which is suitable for each adjacent\r\nindividual formation. Other edaphic societies are those of marl ponds,\r\nalkaline areas, oases in deserts, warm oases in arctic lands, the\r\nforested areas along river bottoms in prairie or plains regions, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 493.

Howe.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 494.\r\n\r\nZonal distribution of plants, South Shore, Cayuga Lake.]\r\n\r\n=928. Aquatic plant societies.=—In general we might distinguish\r\nthree kinds, 1st. _Fresh-water plant societies_, with floating algæ\r\nlike spirogyra, œdogonium, etc., the floating duck-meats, riccias; the\r\nplants of the lily type with roots and stems attached to the bottom\r\nand leaves floating on the surface, like the water-lily and certain\r\npondweeds, and finally the completely submerged ones like certain\r\npondweeds, the bassweed (Chara), etc. 2d. _Marine plant societies_,\r\nwhich are made up mostly of the red and brown algæ or “seaweeds,”\r\nthough some green algæ and flowering plants also occur. 3d. _The salt\r\nmarshes_ where the water is brackish and there is usually a luxuriant\r\ngrowth of marsh-grasses.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[47] For a fuller discussion of this subject by the author see Chapters\r\nXLVI-LVII of his “College Text-book of Botany” (Henry Holt & Co.).\r\n\r\n[48] =οῖκος= = house, and =λόγος= = discourse.\r\n\r\n[49] Term used by Schimper.\r\n\r\n[50] See the author’s “College Text-book of Botany.” Chapter XLIX.\r\n\r\n[51] =ἔδαφος= = ground.\r\n\r\n[52] For a full discussion of forest societies see Chapter L in the\r\nauthor’s “College Text-book of Botany.”\r\n\r\n[53] See Chapter LIV of the author’s “College Text-book of Botany.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII.\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION OF THE ANGIOSPERMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nRelation of Species, Genus, Family, Order, etc.\r\n\r\n=929. Species.=—It is not necessary for one to be a botanist in\r\norder to recognize, during a stroll in the woods where the trillium\r\nis flowering, that there are many individual plants very like each\r\nother. They may vary in size, and the parts may differ a little in\r\nform. When the flowers first open they are usually white, and in age\r\nthey generally become pinkish. In some individuals they are pinkish\r\nwhen they first open. Even with these variations, which are trifling\r\nin comparison with the points of close agreement, we recognize the\r\nindividuals to be of the _same kind_, just as we recognize the corn\r\nplants, grown from the seed of an ear of corn, as of the same kind.\r\nIndividuals of the same kind, in this sense, form a _species_. The\r\nwhite wake-robin, then, is a species.\r\n\r\nBut there are other trilliums which differ greatly from this one. The\r\npurple trillium (T. erectum) shown in fig. 495 is very different from\r\nit. So are a number of others. But the purple trillium is a species. It\r\nis made up of individuals variable, yet very like one another, more so\r\nthan any one of them is like the white wake-robin.\r\n\r\n=930. Genus.=—Yet if we study all parts of the plant, the\r\nperennial rootstock, the annual shoot, and the parts of the flower, we\r\nfind a great resemblance. In this respect we find that there are\r\nseveral species which possess the same general characters. In other\r\nwords, there is a relationship between these different species, a\r\nrelationship which includes more than the individuals of one kind. It\r\nincludes several kinds. Obviously, then, this is a relationship with\r\nbroader limits, and of a higher grade, than that of the individuals\r\nof a species. The grade next higher than species we call _genus_.\r\nTrillium, then, is a genus. Briefly the characters of the genus\r\ntrillium are as follows:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 495. Trillium erectum (purple form), two plants\r\nfrom one rootstock.]\r\n\r\n=931. Genus trillium.=—Perianth of six parts: sepals 3,\r\nherbaceous, persistent; petals colored. Stamens 6 (in two whorls),\r\nanthers opening inward. Ovary 3-loculed, 3-6-angled; stigmas 3,\r\nslender, spreading. Herbs with a stout perennial rootstock, with\r\nfleshy, scale-like leaves, from which the low annual shoot arises,\r\nbearing a terminal flower and 3 large netted-veined leaves in a whorl.\r\n\r\n      _Note._—In speaking of the genus the present usage\r\n    is to say trillium, but two words are usually employed\r\n    in speaking of the species, as Trillium grandiflorum,\r\n    T. erectum, etc.\r\n\r\n=932. Genus erythronium.=—The yellow adder-tongue, or dogtooth\r\nviolet (Erythronium americanum), shown in fig. 496, is quite different\r\nfrom any species of trillium. It differs more from any of the species\r\nof trillium than they do from each other. The perianth is of six parts,\r\nlight yellow, often spotted near the base. Stamens are 6. The ovary is\r\nobovate, tapering at the base, 3-valved, seeds rather numerous, and the\r\nstyle is elongated. The flower stem, or scape, arises from a scaly bulb\r\ndeep in the soil, and is sheathed by two elliptical-lanceolate, mottled\r\nleaves. The smaller plants have no flower and but one leaf, while the\r\nbulb is nearer the surface. Each year new bulbs are formed at the end\r\nof runners from a parent bulb. These runners penetrate each year deeper\r\ninto the soil. The deeper bulbs bear the flower stems.\r\n\r\n=933. Genus lilium.=—While the lily differs from either the\r\ntrillium or erythronium, yet we recognize a relationship when we\r\ncompare the perianth of six colored parts, the 6 stamens, and the\r\n3-sided and long 3-loculed ovary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 496. Adder-tongue (erythronium). At left below\r\npistil, and three stamens opposite three parts of the perianth. Bulb at\r\nthe right.]\r\n\r\n=934. Family Liliaceæ.=—The relationship between genera, as\r\nbetween trillium, erythronium, and lilium, brings us to a still higher\r\norder of relationship, where the limits are broader than in the genus.\r\nGenera which are thus related make up the _family_. In the case of\r\nthese genera the family has been named after the lily, and is the lily\r\nfamily, or _Liliaceæ_.\r\n\r\n=935. Order, class, group.=—In like manner the lily family, the\r\niris family, the amaryllis family, and others which show characters of\r\nclose relationship are united into an _order_ which has broader limits\r\nthan the family. This order is the lily order, or order _Liliales_. The\r\nvarious orders unite to make up the _class_, and the classes unite to\r\nform a _group_.\r\n\r\n=936. Variations in usage of the terms class, order, etc.=—Thus,\r\naccording to the system of classification adopted by some, the\r\nangiosperms form a _group_. The group angiosperms is then divided into\r\ntwo _classes_, the _monocotyledones_ and _dicotyledones_. (It should\r\nbe remembered that all systematists do not agree in assigning the\r\nsame grade and limits to the classes, subclasses, etc. For example,\r\nsome treat of the angiosperms as a class, and the monocotyledons\r\nand dicotyledons as subclasses; while others would divide the\r\nmonocotyledons and dicotyledons into classes, instead of treating each\r\none as a class or as a subclass. Systematists differ also in usage as\r\nto the termination of the ordinal name; for example, some use the word\r\n_Liliales_ for _Liliifloræ_, in writing of the order.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 497.\r\n\r\n_A._ Cross-section of the stem of an oak tree thirty-seven years old,\r\nshowing the annual rings. _rm_, the medullary rays; _m_, the pith\r\n(medulla). _B._ Cross-section of the stem of a palm tree, showing the\r\nscattered bundles.]\r\n\r\n=937. Monocotyledones.=—In the monocotyledons there is a single\r\ncotyledon on the embryo; the leaves are parallel-veined; the parts\r\nof the flower are usually in threes; endosperm is usually present in\r\nthe seed; the vascular bundles are usually closed, and are scattered\r\nirregularly through the stem as shown by a cross-section of the stem\r\nof a palm (fig. 497), or by the arrangement of the bundles in the corn\r\nstem (fig. 57). Thus a single character is not sufficient to show\r\nrelationship in the class (nor is it in orders, nor in many of the\r\nlower grades), but one must use the sum of several important characters.\r\n\r\n=938. Dicotyledones.=—In the dicotyledons there are two\r\ncotyledons on the embryo; the venation of the leaves is reticulate;\r\nthe endosperm is usually absent in the seed; the parts of the flower\r\nare frequently in fives; the vascular bundles of the stem are\r\ngenerally open and arranged in rings around the stem, as shown in the\r\ncross-section of the oak (fig. 497). There are exceptions to all the\r\nabove characters, and the sum of the characters must be considered,\r\njust as in the case of the monocotyledons.\r\n\r\n=939. Taxonomy.=—This grouping of plants into species, genera,\r\nfamilies, etc., according to characters and relationships is\r\n_classification_, or _taxonomy_.\r\n\r\nTo take Trillium grandiflorum for example, its position in the system,\r\nif all the principal subdivisions should be included in the outline,\r\nwould be indicated as follows:\r\n\r\n    Group, Angiosperms.\r\n      Class, Monocotyledones.\r\n        Order, Liliales.\r\n          Family, Liliaceæ.\r\n            Genus, Trillium.\r\n              Species, grandiflorum.\r\n\r\nIn the same way the position of the toothwort would be indicated as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    Group, Angiosperms.\r\n      Class, Dicotyledones.\r\n        Order, Papaverales.\r\n          Family, Cruciferæ.\r\n            Genus, Dentaria.\r\n              Species, diphylla.\r\n\r\nBut in giving the technical name of the plant only two of these names\r\nare used, the genus and species, so that for the toothwort we say\r\n_Dentaria diphylla_, and for the white wake-robin we say _Trillium\r\ngrandiflorum_.\r\n\r\n=940. Kingdom and Subkingdom.=—Organic beings form altogether two\r\nkingdoms, the Animal Kingdom and the Plant Kingdom. The Plant Kingdom\r\nis then divided into a number of subkingdoms as follows: 1st,\r\nSubkingdom Thallophyta, the thallus plants, including the Algæ and\r\nFungi; 2d, Subkingdom Bryophyta, the moss-like plants, including the\r\nLiverworts and Mosses; 3d, Subkingdom Pteridophyta, the fern-like\r\nplants, including Ferns, Lycopods, Equisetum, Isoetes, etc.; 4th,\r\nSubkingdom Spermatophyta, the seed plants, including Gymnosperms and\r\nAngiosperms. Subkingdoms are divided into groups of lower order down to\r\nthe classes. So there are subclasses, subfamilies or tribes, subgenera,\r\nand even subspecies. But taking the principal taxonomic divisions from\r\nthe greater to the lesser rank, the order would be as follows:\r\n\r\n    Plant Kingdom.\r\n      Subkingdom, Spermatophyta.\r\n        Group (not used in a definite sense).\r\n          Class, Gymnospermæ.\r\n            Order, Pinales.\r\n              Family, Pinaceæ.\r\n                Genus, Pinus.\r\n                  Species, strobus, or, in full,\r\n        Pinus strobus, the white pine.\r\n\r\n\r\nGroup Angiospermæ.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. CLASS MONOCOTYLEDONES.\r\n\r\n=941. Order Pandanales.=—Aquatic or marsh plants. The cattail\r\nflags (Typha) and the bur-reeds (Sparganium), each representing a\r\nfamily. The name of the order is taken from the tropical genus Pandanus\r\n(the screw-pine often grown in greenhouses).\r\n\r\n=942. Order Naiadales.=—Aquatic or marsh herbs. Three families\r\nare mentioned here.\r\n\r\nThe pondweed family (Naiadaceæ), named after one genus, Naias. The\r\nlargest genus is Potamogeton, the species of which are known as\r\npondweeds. Ruppia occidentalis occurs in saline ponds in Nebraska, and\r\nR. maritima along the seacoast and in saline districts in the interior.\r\n\r\nThe water-plantain family (Alismaceæ) includes the water-plantain\r\n(Alisma) and the arrow-leaves (Sagittaria).\r\n\r\nThe tape-grass family (Vallisneriaceæ) includes the tape-grass, or\r\neel-grass (the curious Vallisneria spiralis).\r\n\r\n=943. Order Graminales.=—Two families.\r\n\r\nThe grass family (Gramineæ), the grasses and grains.\r\n\r\nThe sedge family (Cyperaceæ), the sedges.\r\n\r\n=944.

(By mail, $3.34.)\r\n\r\n      A popular, but thoroughly scientific book, including\r\n    all the ferns in the region covered by Britton’s\r\n    Manual. Much information is also given concerning\r\n    reproduction and classification, fern photography, etc.\r\n\r\n                PROF. L. M. UNDERWOOD, OF COLUMBIA:\r\n          “It is really more scientific than one would\r\n        expect from a work of a somewhat popular nature.\r\n        The photographs are very fine, very carefully\r\n        selected and will add much to the text. I do not\r\n        see how they could be much finer.”\r\n\r\n                      THE PLANT WORLD:\r\n          “This book is likely to prove the leading popular\r\n        work on ferns. The majority of the illustrations\r\n        are from original photographs; in respect to this\r\n        feature, it can be confidently asserted that _no\r\n        finer examples of fern photography have ever been\r\n        produced_.... May be expected to prove of permanent\r\n        scientific value, as well as to satisfy a want\r\n        which existing treatises have but imperfectly\r\n        filled.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                          MUSHROOMS\r\n\r\n    Edible, Poisonous Mushrooms, etc. By Prof. GEO.

In addition to its general\r\n        attractiveness and the beauty of its illustrations,\r\n        it is written in a style well calculated to win the\r\n        merest tyro or the most accomplished student of the\r\n        fungi.... These clear photographs and the plain\r\n        descriptions make the book especially valuable for\r\n        the amateur fungus hunter in picking out the edible\r\n        from the poisonous species of the most common\r\n        kinds.”\r\n\r\n                         THE PLANT WORLD:\r\n          “This is, without doubt, the most important and\r\n        valuable work of its kind that has appeared in this\r\n        country in recent years....

It is based on _An Illustrated\r\n    Flora_, prepared by Prof. Britton in co-operation with Judge\r\n    Addison Brown. The text has been revised and brought up to\r\n    date, and much of novelty has been added. All illustrations are\r\n    omitted, but specific reference has been made to all of the 4,162\r\n    figures in the _Illustrated Flora_.\r\n\r\n      “It is the most complete and reliable work that ever appeared\r\n    in the form of a flora of this region, and for the first time we\r\n    have a manual in which the plant descriptions are drawn from the\r\n    plants themselves, and do not represent compiled descriptions\r\n    made by the early writers.”—Prof. D. M. Underwood of Columbia.\r\n\r\n      “This work will at once take its place as the standard manual\r\n    of the region that it covers. It is far superior to any other\r\n    work of its class ever published in America.”—Prof. Conway\r\n    MacMillan of University of Minnesota.\r\n\r\n      “This book must at once find its way into the schools and\r\n    colleges, to which it may be commended for the students in\r\n    systematic botany.”—Prof. Chas.

Bessey in “Science.”\r\n\r\n      “It is nothing if it is not compact; it is nothing if it is\r\n    not up to date; it is nothing if it is not the work of a master.\r\n    What more can be said, save that the more it is used the greater\r\n    the appreciation by the plant-lovers in the region which it\r\n    covers.”—Prof. Byron D. Halsted of Rutgers College.\r\n\r\n      “The work is well done; and as it is the only volume which\r\n    gives in a way suitable for students the present state of\r\n    the science, it cannot fail to take its place as a standard\r\n    work.”—Prof. George Macloskie of Princeton.\r\n\r\n      “I regard the book as one that we cannot do without and one\r\n    that will henceforth take its place as a necessary means of\r\n    determination of the plant species within its range.”—Prof. V.\r\n    M. Spalding of University of Michigan.\r\n\r\n      “An exceedingly valuable contribution to our botanical\r\n    literature....
